This factor has a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of NF-sB but is unrelated to this or other Rel proteins by functional and biochemical criteria .
It can also be distinguished from other previously described lymphocyte-specific DNA-binding proteins .
The TC-II motif in the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) enhancer [ 5'- ( 246 ) TGGAAAGTCCCCA ( 234 ) -3 ' ] mediates a strong transcriptional response to stimulation by interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) .
Previous work indicates that this response is due to activation of NF-KB ( 10 , 33 , 43 ) , which specifically binds to the TC-II sequence .
We have shown that in an immature T-cell line , PC60 ( 7 ) , IL-1 induces the appearance of maximal NF- « B activity in less than 20 min and induces a rapid increase in the expression of a B-globin reporter gene whose promoter contains four copies of the TC-II enhanson .
Although nuclei from nonstimulated PC6O cells contain no detectable NF-kB , the TC-II motif also acts as a constitutive enhanson in these cells .
As previously reported ( 10 ) , the TC-II sequence not only binds NF- « B but also forms specific complexes with other proteins that are constitutively active in PC6O0 cells but were not detected in a pre-B-cell line , 70Z/3 .
In this article , we describe a more detailed characterization of this TC-II-specific protein ( s ) ( here called NP-TC ; , ; ) .
We show that NP-TC , , binding activity is constitutively present in T and B lymphocytes but not in nonhemopoietic cell types , which suggests a role for NP-TC ; , in lymphocyte differentiation .
We present evidence that the constitutive enhancer activity of the TC-II motif is indeed due to NP-TC ; .
The biochemical and functional properties of NP-TCy , rule out a close relationship with NF- « B and other proteins of the Rel family and show that NP-TC ; ; is different from other lymphocyte-specific DNA-binding proteins .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids and probes .
TC-II probe .
The TC-II-containing , EcoRI-HindIII 73-bp fragment of pSPT-TCII was end labelled as previously described ( 10 ) .
pG1 plasmids .
pG1 contains the rabbit B-globin gene from positions -109 to +1650 inserted into pBR322 .
pG1.TC-30 * Corresponding author .
5217 contains an inverted head-to-tail tetramer of the SV40 TC-II motif ( bp 233 to 247 [ 49 ] ) inserted upstream of the B-globin gene .
pGI.TC-33 to -TC-46 differ from pG1.TC-30 by point mutations in the TC-II motif ( 18 ) .
Plasmids were purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation ( 10 ) , and the TC-II tetram-ers were resequenced .
For competition experiments , tet-rameric fragments were excised and purified on a 4 % low-melting-point agarose ( Nusieve ; FMC , Rockland , Maine ) gel .
pGBAcBGID plasmid contains a version of the B-globin gene carrying a 40-bp deletion in the second exon and is transcribed under the control of the constitutive chicken B-actin promoter ( 46 ) .
Cell culture and cytokine induction .
Cells were grown exponentially to 4 x 10° to 8 x 10° cells per ml .
An aliquot was treated for 30 min with human recombinant IL-1fB ( 1 ng/ml ; a gift of Glaxo ) or with tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) ( 10+ U/ml ; a gift of W. Fiers , Gent University ) .
Adherent cells were grown to near confluency and induced on the plate .
Thymocytes and splenic lymphocytes were prepared by gentle homogenization of the tissues .
Nylon wool columns were used to separate Ficoll-purified spleen cells into a nonadherent ( -90 % T-cell ) and an adherent ( > 90 % B-cell ) fraction ( 17 ) .
Nuclear extracts and gel retardation assay .
Nuclear extracts were prepared at 4°C by the method of Schreiber et al .
( 40 ) .
4-Amidinophenylmethylsulfony !
fluoride ( 50 pg/ml ) was added to buffer A. Adherent cells were lysed directly on the plate .
Extracts were aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen .
The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , Calif. ) .
For proteolysis experiments , nuclear extract was incubated with trypsin ( 50 ng/4 to 15 pug of total protein ; Boehringer Mann-heim ) at room temperature for 5 min .
The reaction was stopped by addition of 500 ng of aprotinin ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
IxB and antibodies .
IxBa was purified as previously described ( 55 ) .
The polyclonal antibodies against the human 5218 LATTION ET AL .
p50 subunit of NF- « B ( antiserum 2 against amino acids 19 to 969 of p50 ) have been described by Kieran et al .
( 20 ) , and those against a segment of the chicken v-re/ protein expressed in bacteria ( antisera 1 and 2 against amino acids 148 to 316 and 346 to 438 of p59 ) have been described by Simek et al .
( 45 ) .
Gel filtration chromatography .
Nuclear extract of ELA cells ( 3.6 mg of total proteins ) was applied to a calibrated Superose 12 column ( Pharmacia ) equilibrated with nuclear extraction buffer ( buffer C ) containing 0.4 M NaCl .
During elution with the same buffer , 300-4l fractions were collected , and a 1.5-pl aliquot of each fraction was used to test TC-II binding activity .
Heparin chromatography .
Nuclear extracts prepared from PC60 cells induced by IL-1 ( 2 mg of total protein ) were passed over a heparin-Sepharose column ( 1 ml of wet resin ; Pharmacia ) .
The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a step gradient ( 2 mIl/50 mM change in KCI concentration ) in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES ( N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-NV ' -2-ethanesulfonic acid ) ( pH 7.9 ) , 1 mM B-mercaptoethanol , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , and 0.2 mM EDTA .
Fractions ( 0.3 ml ) were assayed for NP-TC ; , and NF- « B .
Band shifts , footprints , and DNA methylation protection .
Binding reactions and electrophoresis conditions for gel retardation assays have been described previously ( 10 ) .
About 300 pg ( = 6 fmol ) of labeled TC-II fragment from pSPT-TCII was added in all reaction mixtures .
For competition assays , 250 to 300 fmol of unlabeled DNA was in-cluded .
Footprints were obtained as previously described ( 10 ) , with the following modifications .
Two or 4 pl of heparin-fractionated NP-TC ; , , was incubated with 6 ng of labelled SV40 Haelll-Ncol fragment ( nucleotides [ nt ] 331 to 40 ) in 12 ul containing 4 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) .
poly ( dI-dC ) , 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 20 mM NaCl , 0.5 mM B-mercaptoethanol , 0.2 mM EDTA , and 0.05 % Nonidet P-40 .
After 30 min , 1 pl ( 0.2 U ) of DNase I ( Pharmacia ) in 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) -10 mM CaCl , -10 mM MgCIl ; -50 % glycerol was added .
The reaction was stopped after 1 min .
Competitions included a 22 M excess of TC-II motif excised from pG1.TC-30 .
Transfections .
PC 60.21.14.4 cells ( 7 , 44 ) were transfected with mixtures of a pG1 plasmid and the reference plasmid pGBAcBGID , treated with IL-1 , and processed as previously described ( 10 ) .
The transcriptional activities of different plasmids were compared by using the polymerase chain reaction-based assay developed by Sperisen et al .
( 46 ) .
Briefly , the RNA from transfected cells was reverse tran-scribed , and the cDNA was amplified in the presence of [ « - `` °P ] dATP with primers spanning the first intron of the B-globin reporter gene as well as the deletion in the pGBAcBGID reference plasmid .
Polymerase chain reaction products were fractionated on a sequencing gel , and signals due to pGl and pGBAcBG1D mRNA were quantified by densitometric analysis .
Their ratio is a linear function of the ratio of transfecting plasmid DNAs ( 46 ) .
Thus , when cells are transfected with the same ratio of different pGI.TC plasmids and pGBAcBG1D , the signal ratios obtained are proportional to the promoter strength of the pG1.TC plasmids .
Computer-assisted determination of a putative consensus sequence .
A novel computer algorithm has been developed in order to find a hypothetical consensus sequence description for the DNA-binding specificity of NP-TCy , .
The principle of the algorithm is to evaluate a set of candidate motifs by correlating their best matches in a series of competitor Mor .
CELL .
Bor .
fragments with the binding efficiencies of these fragments and then to rank them by a quality score .
The input data consist of a set of ( typically short ) DNA sequences , each one associated with a number reflecting its relative protein binding efficiency in band shift experiments .
Here , these numbers were determined by titrating the capacity of the unlabelled sequences to compete with the labelled TC-II probe in reaction mixtures containing a constant amount of nuclear extract from PC6O and an excess of TC-II probe .
Addition of 5 M excess of cold TC-II probe reduced the amount of specifically retarded probe by 50 % .
For the other sequences , relative activity was determined by measuring the amount of competitor needed to give the same reduction .
The binding activity of TC-II was given an arbitrary value of 6 on a scale in which a difference of 1 U corresponds to a twofold change in competitor efficiency .
The set of candidate sequence motifs is defined by the length ( / ) of the motif and the number ( k ) of explicitly specified bases ( A , C , G , and T ) ( i.e .
, the number of positions not occupied by N ) .
Here , we considered all motifs of the following types : / = 6 , 4 < k < 6,1 = 7,4 sks 7 ; 1= 8,5 < k < 7 ; l1= 9,5 < k < 7 .
The algorithm determines for each competitor fragment the quantity m , , , defined as the number of matches between the sequence motif i and the most similar subsequence in fragment J .
A classical correlation coefficient is used as quality score for ranking : N 3 , ( my - m ; ) ( ; - % ) j=1 `` =T w 12 3 ( m ; -my 3 ( -* j=l j=l where x ; is the competitor efficiency of fragment j and N is the number of fragments tested .

RESULTS Previous characterization of specific TC-II binding proteins in PC6O nuclei had revealed , besides IL-l-inducible NF- « xB , complexes that were formed by extracts from cells growing in normal as well as in IL-1-suppilemented medium ( 10 ) .
We call the protein ( s ) giving rise to these complexes NP-TC ; , , .
The formation of both NF- « B and NP-TC ; , , complexes is specifically inhibited by the addition of unlabelled TC-II DNA .
As described previously , the addition of nucle-otides to the binding reaction strongly reduces the NP-TC , band shift but has the opposite effect on NF-kB .
Both NF- « B and NP-TC ; , , complexes are heat labile , since incubation for 5 min at 65°C completely suppresses their binding to DNA .
They have similar electrophoretic mobilities , but the latter shows a much more heterogeneous pattern .
This is unlikely to be due to proteolytic degradation during nuclear extraction , as it is not reduced by different protease inhibi-tors ( 0.2 wM aprotinin ; 200 wM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluo-ride ; and 1 mM each pepstatin , antipain , leupeptin , and chymostatin ) .
Attempts to reduce heterogeneity by changing composition of the binding reaction or electrophoresis buff-ers , acrylamide percentage , or migration conditions were Vor .

Nuclear extracts from PC60 or 70Z2/3 cells , cultured in normal or in IL-1-supplemented medium , were treated for 5 min with 10 pg of trypsin per ml .
Undigested and trypsin ( TRYPS ) -treated extracts were incubated with TC-II probe in the presence or absence of ATP and/or a 45-fold excess of unlabelled competitor ( COMP ) DNA containing the wild-type TC-II motif ( w ) or the mutant TC-42 ( m ) .

Trypsin-treated nuclear extracts from noninduced and IL-1-treated PC6O cells form two major specific complexes with the TC-II probe ( Tl and T2 ) that migrate faster than the ones due to NF- « B fragments .
As for NP-TC , , , the Tl and T2 complexes are inhibited by ATP , and comparison of the fine specificities ( see Fig .
5 ) clearly shows that Tl and T2 are derived from NP-TC ; , .
We do not know what the relationship between Tl and T2 is .
Digestion kinetics do not provide any evidence that Tl might be a precursor of T2 .
Note that the relative predominance of T1 and T2 consistently varies among different cell lines ( see Fig .
4 ) .
NP-TC , , consists of heterogeneous proteins with the same DNA-binding moieties or domains .
To determine whether the heterogeneity of NP-TC , , complexes observed on nondena-turing band shift gels reflects size heterogeneity of the DNA-binding proteins , we fractionated nuclear extract from NP-TC ; , containing EL4 thymoma cells on a Superose column .
Figure 3A shows that NP-TC ; , activity coelutes with proteins with molecular masses of between 550 and 370 kDa .
There is a good correlation between elution volume and electrophoretic mobility of NP-TC ; , complexes .
This indicates that at least part of the heterogeneity in the band shift pattern is due to molecular weight variation of NP-TC ; , .
All fractions , when digested with trypsin , gave rise to the Tl and T2 complexes ( Fig .
3B ) .
Attempts to dissociate possible oligomeric complexes , by treatment with increasing concentrations of deoxycholate ( DOC ) followed by the addition of Nonidet P-40 , were unsuccessful .
Beyond concentrations of 2 % DOC , binding activity of NP-TC ; , was gradually inhib-ited , but no shift to a faster-migrating complex was observed ( data not shown ) .
NP-TC ; , , activity is restricted principally to lymphocytes .
NP-TC ; , was first observed in extracts of PC6O cells which have phenotypic characteristics of immature T cells .
The pre-B-cell line 70Z , /3 and HeLa cells contained no detectable NP-TC ; , activity ( 10 ) .
This suggested a restricted tissue distribution of NP-TC , , DNA-binding activity .

( A and B ) T and B cells ; ( C ) nonlymphoid hemopoietic cells ; ( D ) nonhemopoietic cells ; ( E ) normal mouse lymphocytes .
gate its tissue specificity , we screened nuclear extracts from different cell lines and normal tissues for NP-TC ; , activity .
Cell lines were grown in normal medium or stimulated with IL-1 or TNF .
Untreated or trypsin-digested extracts were used for band shift assays with the TC-II probe ( Fig .
4 ) .
Specificity of presumptive NP-TC ; ; activity was tested by addition of unlabelled TC-II competitor .
Results are summarized in Table 1 .
As expected , strong constitutive NF-kB activity was found in all B-cell lines .
Extracts from most T-cell lines also contained detectable constitutive NF-kB .
As previously reported ( 10 , 33 ) , IL-1 or TNF a strongly increased NF-KB activity in almost all T-cell lines and induced its appearance in most NF- « B-negative cells regardless of tissue origin .
Constitutive NP-TC ; ; binding activity is present in extracts of all human and rodent T-cell lines tested .
NP-TC ; , was also detected in all pre-B- and mature B-cell lines tested .
70Z7/3 cells contain little NP-TC ; , , activity .
Although there was some variation in the electrophoretic mobilities of undigested NP-TC ; , from the different cell lines , complexes Tl and T2 formed by trypsin-treated extracts migrated with the same mobilities .
However , there were notable differences in the relative abundances of Tl and T2 .
Mouse Tl and T2 , as well as « 1 complexes , migrate slightly faster than their human counterparts .
Among normal mouse lymphocytes , thymocytes are quite rich in Splenic B and T lymphocytes contained both NF-kB and NP-TC , .
As expected , NF- « B predominated in B cells , whereas T cells contain more NP-TCJ , .
We could detect strong NP-TC , plike activity also in extracts from K562 , a cell line representing precursors of the erythrocytic , granulocytic , and monocytic lineages .
Other cell lines belonging to the monocyte-macrophage lineage or representing myeloid precursor stages contained small amounts of NP-TC ; ; -like activity .
In a variety of cell lines of nonhematopoietic origin , we detected no NP-TC ; , ( Table 1 ) .
We found some activity in the rat hepatoma cell line Fao but not in HepG2 , a human hepatoma , or in mouse liver extract .
Treatment with IL-1 had no effect on NP-TC ; , activity in any of the cell lines tested .
NP-TC , , and NF-B differ in their fine specificities .
Both NP-TC ; , and NF- « xB bind specifically to the TC-II motif .
To compare more precisely the sequence specificities of NF-kB and NP-TC ; , , , we used TC-II oligonucleotides containing single point mutations in each of the 13 bp forming the TC-II motif of SV40 as competitors for the TC-II probe ( Fig .
5 ) .
This experiment revealed an overall similarity , but also some clear differences , between the specificities of NF- « B and NP-TC ; , , .
The binding of both factors is reduced by mutations in nt 242 to 245 and somewhat less by mutations in nt 241 and 239 .
However , NF- « B binding is also reduced by an alteration of nt 236 and is most strongly diminished by the mutations in nt 237 .
These two mutations have no or only a marginal effect on NP-TC ; , , binding .
The point mutations have the same effect on the binding of NF- « B and NP-TC ; , as on that of their proteolytic fragments ( Tl and T2 for NP-TC ; , and « 1 for NF- « B ) .
This validates the assignment of the origin of the tryptic DNA-binding fragments ( Fig .
1 ) .
The results obtained with NF- « B confirm earlier studies by Macchi et al .
( 25 ) .
We have previously ( 10 ) shown that G237 , G238 , and G240 were protected against DNase I cleavage and methylation by dimethyl sulfate ( DMS ) only by extracts from IL-1-treated PC6O cells , whereas G244 and G245 were protected by extracts from both induced and uninduced cells .
This agrees Vor .

DNase I footprinting and DMS methylation protection performed with heparin-fractionated NP-TC ; , from ELA cells confirmed these results ( Fig .
6A ) .
In addition to the TC-II site ( nt 236 to 249 ) , a region between nt 261 and 288 on the late strand was protected from DNase I. DMS treatment revealed that NP-TC , , bound to each of the three repeats of the motif G ( T/C ) GGAA ( T/A ) G ( TC-II , site I , and site II in Fig .
6B ) .
In TC-II and site I , the first guanine in the repeat is also protected , whereas the last guanine is hypermethylated in TC-II and site II .
Consensus sequence for NP-TC , , .
We searched for binding sites in a number of sequences from the 5 ' flanking regions of cellular promoters ( Table 2 ) by testing their capacity to compete with the TC-II probe .
We used these data , together with similar data from the TC-II point mutations TC-33 to -46 , to derive a consensus NP-TC ; , binding sequence by applying to them the novel computer algorithm CONSCOR ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The competition efficiency estimates for the point mutations were 6 for TC-40 ; 5 for TC-34 , -35 , -36 , -38 , and -46 ; 4 for TC-33 and -37 ; 3 for TC-39 and -41 ; and 1 for TC-42 , -43 , -44 , and -45 .
The efficiencies of the other fragments are shown in Table 2 .
A comprehensive collection of candidate sequence motifs between 6 and 9 bases long ( see Materials and Methods ) has been compared with these data .
The presence of four closely related motifs , ANANTTTCC ( r = 0.886 ) , CANTTTCC ( r = 0.882 ) , CNANNTTCC ( ¢ = 0.871 ) , and AGTTTCC ( r = 0.850 ) , correlated well with binding strength .
The first three motifs are in perfect qualitative agreement with the data , meaning that each competitor fragment containing a better match than another also has a higher or equal competitor efficiency .
The `` best ' motif , ANANTTTCC , has been used to indicate putative binding sites in Table 2 , but , with very few exceptions , all four variants map to the same locations in 5222 LATTION ET AL .

They were incubated with TC-II probe in the presence of a 45 M excess of unlabelled competitor ( COMPET ) .
Competing DNA was unrelated ( NS ) or contained TC-II motifs with a point mutation in the indicated position ( position 34 corresponds to nt 234 in the SV40 enhancer ) .

Previous transfection experiments had shown that the tetramerized TC-II motif in pG1.TC-30 conferred a very strong and rapid IL-1 response on the rabbit B-globin promoter ( 10 ) .
Baseline promoter activity of the same construct was also much stronger than those of constructs containing no or other enhancer elements .
To determine whether this constitutive activity is due to NP-TC ; , , we compared the expression of the pG1.TC point mutant in transiently transfected PC6O cells .
For each pG1.TC plasmid , we compared constitutive expression with expression after IL-1 treatment ( Fig .
7A ) .
As expected , pG1 expression was not affected by IL-1 and expression of all other plasmids was normalized to this level .
Figure 7B shows that the pGI.TC plasmids fall into two groups : the first group includes pG1.TC-30 ( containing the wild-type TC-II motif ) and plasmids with mutations in nt 234 , 235 , 236 , 238 , 240 , 243 , and 246 , which are more strongly expressed in IL-1-treated cells .
This reflects , pre-sumably , induction of NF- « B .
For these plasmids , it is impossible to decide whether expression in the absence of IL-1 is due to NP-TC ; , or a low level of NF- « B in nuclei of noninduced cells .
However , expression of plasmids belong ing to the second group and carrying mutations in nt 237 , 239 , 241 , 242 , 244 , and 245 is not affected by IL-1 treatment , indicating that the plasmids do not respond to NF- « B .
Comparison of the expression of these plasmids with the capacity of their TC-II motif to compete for NP-TC ; ; binding ( Fig .
5 ) reveals a striking correlation : the mutation of nt 237 has very little effect on NP-TC ; , binding , and this TC-II variant has a 10-fold constitutive enhancer activity .
The mutation in nt 239 reduces NP-TC ; , binding and enhancer activities partially .
Mutations in nt 241 and 245 reduce both binding and enhanson activities further , while alterations in nt 242 and 244 diminish both almost to background .
The same result was obtained in three independent transfection experiments .
By plotting the competitor efficiency of the IL-l-unresponsive TC-II variants against the logarithm of their transcriptional activity , we obtained a correlation value of 0.94 ( Fig .
7C ) .
While we have no specific explanation for the linear relationship between the logarithm of transcriptional activity and binding activity , these results strongly suggest that NP-TC ; , is responsible for at least part of the constitutive enhancer activity of the TC-II motif .
NP-TC ; ; differs from Rel-like proteins .
Both NF- « B subunits ( p50 and p65 ) belong to the re/ proto-oncogene family ( 13 , 20 , 38 ) .
Proteins belonging to this family can dimerize with each other .
Our previous observations that NP-TC ; , had a binding specificity similar to that of NF- < B led to the suggestion that NP-TC ; ; was related to NF- « B .

To explore this possibility , we examined whether NP-TC , ; could interact with the NF- « B-specific cytoplasmic inhibitor IB , which associates with NF- « B and inhibits its binding activity ( 1 , 2 , 32 ) .
Purified IxBa ( 40 pg ) ( 55 ) could completely abolish NF- « xB binding activity in extracts from PC6O and 70Z/3 cells ( Fig .

We also checked whether anti-NF- « B or anti-Rel antibodies cross-reacted with NP-TC ; , ( data not shown ) .

( A ) Results from a single transfection experiment .
Each lane shows the mRNA-derived polymerase chain reaction fragments from PC6O cells cotransfected with the indicated amounts of the reference plasmid pGBAcBGD and a pG1 plasmid .
pG1L.TC plasmids are identified by the position of the mutated TC-HI nucleotide ( Fig .

pG1.TC-30 ( w ) contains the nonmutated TC-II motif ; pG1 contains no enhancer motifs .
M , size markers .
( B ) Comparison of the expression of the different plasmids in untreated or IL-l-treated PC60 cells .
For each sample , the ratio between pG1L.TC and pGBAcBGD mRNA signals is measured ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Expression values standardized in this way are normalized to the expression of enhancerless plasmid pG1 in unstimulated cells .
( C ) Correlation between enhanson activity and NP-TC ; ; binding .
The amount of cold competitor needed to inhibit 50 % of NP-TC ; , binding was determined for IL-l-unresponsive TC-I1 mutants .
The correlation between NP-TC ; ; binding activities and constitutive enhancer activities ( normalized to pG1 ) is 0.942. its digested fragments .
Likewise , polyclonal antibodies raised against a segment of v-Rel and also recognizing mammalian c-Rel ( 45 ) partially upshifted NF- « B as well as x1 complexes but not NP-TC ; , , or Tl or T2 complexes .
A characteristic feature of most so far described Rel-related proteins is their localization as an inactive complex in the cytoplasm of noninduced cells and their activation and translocation into the nucleus upon appropriate stimulation ( 28 ) .
Cytoplasmic Rel complexes can be disrupted and binding activity can be revealed by treatment with dissoci- ating agents such as DOC .
DOC treatment of cytosolic extracts from PC6O0 cells or unstimulated 70Z7/3 or HeLa cells whose nuclei contain little or no detectable NP-TC ; , , revealed , as expected , NF- « B but no NP-TC ; , ; binding activity ( data not shown ) .

Effect of IxB on NF- « B and NP-TCy .
Nuclear extracts ( 1 ug of protein ) were incubated with TC-II probe in the presence or absence of ATP and/or 40 pg of IxBa .

resolved by gel filtration chromatography .
It is unlikely to be due to proteolytic degradation , as it is not reduced by a range of protease inhibitors .
The observation that limited trypsin digestion of different chromatographic fractions of NP-TC ; ; yields the same well-defined DNA-binding fragments with identical fine specificities suggests either that NP-TC , ; is a family of related proteins with the same DNA-binding domain or that it consists of different oligomeric complexes with the same DNA-binding subunit .
So far , our attempts to dissociate such complexes without destroying the DNA-binding activity have been unsuccessful .
NP-TC ; , is a transcriptional activator .
is a constitutive nuclear protein that specifically recognizes the TC-II motif in the SV40 enhancer .
TC-II is a protoenhancer that strongly responds to NF-kB .
This has complicated analysis of the in vivo function of NP-TC ; , , .
But the very close correlation between NP-TC , ; binding capacity and enhanson activity of those TC-II mutants which do not respond to NF-KB indicates that NP-TC , , is a transcriptional activator .
The expression of the strongest IL-1-unresponsive plasmid , pG1.TC-37 , is much weaker than the constitutive activity of pG1.TC-30 containing the wild-type TC-II motif , suggesting that NP-TC , , is a weaker transcriptional activator than NF- « B .
NP-TC ; , , may be a marker of early lymphoid differentiation .
NP-TC , ; activity is strongest in nuclei of T- and pre-T-cell lines and normal thymic and peripheral T cells .
It is present also in most B- and pre-B-cell lines and splenic B cells , as well as in a primitive hemopoetic precursor line ( K562 ) , but was undetectable in a variety of nonhemopoietic cell lines or tissues .
This tissue distribution suggests that NP-TC ; , plays a role in lymphocyte differentiation .
NP-TC , , is not closely related to the Rel proteins .
Preliminary characterization of NP-TC ; , had indicated similarity of its DNA-binding specificity to that of NF- « B .
Here , we show that NP-TC ; , is not related to NF- « B and is unlikely to be another member of the Rel family .
Five lines of evidence argue specifically against a relationship of NP-TC ; ; with NF- « B .
( i ) Limited trypsin digestion of the two proteins yields different DNA-binding fragments .
( ii ) Both proteins elute at different ionic strengths from a heparin TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NP-TC , , 5225 column .
( iii ) DNA binding of NP-TC ; , can not be inhibited by IxBa , the protein forming an inactive complex with NF-kB by binding to its p65 subunit .
( iv ) Antibodies against the p50 subunit of NF-kB do not react with ( v ) The fine specificities of the two proteins show clear differences despite an overall similarity .
Comparison of the capacity of other TC-II-related sequences to compete for binding of NP-TC ; , ; and NF-KB to the TC-II motif has confirmed this picture ( data not shown ) .
Both NF- « B subunits ( p50 and p65 ) belong to the re !
proto-oncogene family .
One of the characteristics of most Rel-related proteins is their presence as inactive precursors in the cytoplasm and their translocation into the nucleus in response to extracellular stimuli .
In contrast , NP-TC ; , is either constitutively active ( in most lymphoid cells and cell lines ) or undetectable in nucleus or cytoplasm , even after treatment with dissociating agents which reveal the DNA-binding activity of cytoplasmic Rel proteins ( 28 ) .
Evidence against a close relationship between NP-TC ; and Re !
is also provided by the finding that , unlike NP-TCJ , , Rel protein p75 does not bind to the « B motif in the H-2K gene ( 28 ) and that anti-chicken Rel antibodies that cross-react with mammalian Rel and NF- « B do not affect NP-TC ; ; band shifts .
Derivation of a tentative consensus sequence for NP-TC , , .
A novel algorithm , CONSCOR ( see Materials and Methods ) , has been used to derive a consensus recognition sequence for NP-TC ; , which is in perfect qualitative agreement with the experimental evidence .
The advantage of CONSCOR over other techniques based on alignment of putative protein binding regions ( 23 , 48 ) is that it uses `` negative results `` to penalize motifs that occur on sequences which do not bind the protein .
Since the NP-TC , , recognition motif was derived from data with relatively few competitor fragments , the candidate consensus sequences had to satisfy correspondingly few constraints .
However , the results of the CONSCOR analysis are confirmed by the footprinting experiments , which identify completely independently two binding sites that contain good matches with the highest-scoring NP-TC , recognition motif determined by CONSCOR ( Fig .
6B ) .
Further experiments are necessary to discriminate among the four variants with virtually identical scores .
NP-TC ; ; differs from other previously described lymphocyte-specific DNA-binding proteins .
Several other nuclear proteins that recognize the TC-II motif or related sequences have been described , but each of them has characteristics that distinguish it from NP-TC-II .
The TC-II sequence overlaps with the AP2 , AP3 , and EBP1 motifs , but some of the mutations that affect binding of NP-TC , , are located outside the binding sites of these factors ( 5 , 15 , 27 ) .
Further-more , these proteins are present in unstimulated HeLa cells .
Some members of the C/EBP family ( EBP20 [ 16 ] , AGIE-BPI [ 37 ] , AGP/EBP [ 6 ] , H [ 4 ] , IL-6DBP [ 35 ] , and NF-IL6 [ 42 ] ) bind « B-like sequences .
However , these proteins have been found in nonlymphoid cells , and , in contrast to NP-TC , , most of them are heat stable .
Another C/EBP factor , NF-M , is present in various hemopoietic cells belonging to the myeloid and monocytic lineages , whereas its activity in B and T lymphocytes is very weak ( 47 ) .
MBP1 , which binds to the H2-K `` < B-like sequence ( 3 ) , was cloned from a B-cell line , but its mRNA is highly expressed in HeLa cells and present only at a very low level in Jurkat cells .
The ets-1 proto-oncogene product has a tissue distribution similar to that of NP-TC ; , but does not bind to the TC-II motif ( 10a ) .
LyF-1 binds to several lymphocyte-specific gene promoters but is present in HeLa 5226 LATTHION ET AL .
and not in the BW5147 or K562 cell line ( 24 ) .
TCF-la « binds to related sequences in promoters of several genes expressed early in T-cell development .
But it is not found in mature B cells , including Namalwa cells , which contain large amounts of ( 52 , 53 ) .
We conclude that NP-TC ; ; is most likely a new transcription factor that may play a role in lymphocyte differentiation .
To determine definitively its role , we need to further characterize and molecularly clone the constituent protein ( s ) .
