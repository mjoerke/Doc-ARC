Goldfeld®* The level of ongoing HIV-1 replication within an individual is critical to HIV-1 pathogenesis .
Among host immune factors , the cytokine TNF-a has previously been shown to increase HIV-1 replication in various monocyte and T cell model systems .
Here , we demonstrate that signaling through the TNF receptor family member , the lymphotoxin-3 ( LT- $ ) receptor ( LT-BR ) , also regulates HIV-1 replication .
Furthermore , HIV -1 replication is cooperatively stimulated when the distinct LT-BR and TNF receptor systems are simultaneously engaged by their specific ligands .
Moreover , in a physiological coculture cellular assay system , we show that membrane-bound TNF-a and LT- « , 3 , act virtually identically to their soluble forms in the regulation of HIV-1 replication .
Thus , cosignaling via the LT-B and TNF-a receptors is probably involved in the modulation of HIV-1 replication and the subsequent determination of HIV-1 viral burden in monocytes .
Intriguingly , surface expression of LT-a & , , is up-regulated on a T cell line acutely infected with HIV-1 , suggesting a positive feedback loop between HIV-1 infection , LT- « , 3 , expression , and HIV-1 replication .
Given the critical role that LT- « , f ; , plays in lymphoid architecture , we speculate that LT- « , f , may be involved in HIV-associated abnormalities of the lymphoid organs .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 162 ; 6016-6023. key factor both in the progression of HIV-1 infection to clinical AIDS ( 1 , 2 ) , and in the perinatal transmission of HIV-1 from mother to fetus ( 3-5 ) .
The viral set-point within an individual is a function of both viral elimination by the host immune system and the ongoing level of HIV-1 replication ( 6 ) .
Although host immune factors are involved in both these processes , to date they remain poorly defined , particularly with regard to those factors that regulate HIV-1 replication and thus viral load ( reviewed in Ref .
7 ) .
Among host immune factors , the cytokine TNF- has been shown to increase HIV-1 replication in various monocyte and T cell model systems ( 8 , 9 ) .
TNF-a @ exists as both a membrane-bound 26-kDa form and a 17-kDa soluble form ( 10 ) and signals through two receptors , p55 and p75 ( reviewed in Ref .
11 ) .
The two TNF receptors induce both specific and overlapping responses , including activation of the transcription factor , NF- « B ( 12-15 ) .
It has been suggested that the soluble and membrane forms of TNF-a signal preferentially through p55 and p75 ( 16 ) .

E-mail address : goldfeld @ cbr.med.harvard.edu Copyright © 1999 by The American Association of Immunologists The membrane-anchored lymphotoxin-a , 3 ; ligand molecule , which is expressed on the surface of activated T and B cells ( 17 , 18 ) , but not on the surface of cells of nonlymphoid or-igin , binds to the LT-BR .
The LT-BR is expressed on the surface of some monocytic cells ( 18 , 19 ) , some dendritic cells ( 20 ) , and the promyelocyctic U937 cell line ( 18 ) ( our unpublished observa-tions ) , but not on T or B cells .
The LT-BR signals through a pathway that is distinct from the TNF receptor signaling pathways ( reviewed in Ref .
21 ) and is involved in the development of lymph nodes , the maintenance of lymphoid architecture , and the function of follicular dendritic cells ( 18 , 21 , 22 ) .
An additional ligand of unknown biological function called LIGHT can also bind the LT-BR ( 23 ) .
Multiple studies have also underscored the importance of TNF-a in lymphoid biology .
Mice deficient in TNF-a lack germinal center formation in splenic follicles ( 24-26 ) .
Furthermore , TNF-a is involved in the generation of follicular dendritic cells ( 27 ) and B cell proliferation ( 28 ) .
Thus , given that disruption of lymphoid architecture is a hallmark of HIV-1 infection ( 29 , 30 ) , LT-a , B , and TNF-a @ are particularly interesting candidate host factors to study in relation to HIV-1 disease progression and pathogenesis .
The monocyte plays a critical role in the progression of HIV-1 infection .
HIV-1-infected monocytes are numerous early in HIV-1 infection and are a major source of virus in advanced AIDS when the T cell population has been depleted ( 30-32 ) .
The host factors involved in the regulation of HIV-1 replication in monocytes are therefore of particular importance in the establishment of HIV-1 infection , viral burden , and disease progression .

0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology To explore the role of TNF-a and LT-a , 3 , in the regulation of HIV-1 in infected monocytes , we used the chronically HIV-1-infected U1 cell line , which is the best characterized reproducible in vitro monocytic system used to study cytokine-mediated HIV-1 replication ( 9 , 33 , 34 ) .
Here , we show that costimulation through LT-BR and TNF receptors results in a dramatic increase in viral replication in U1 cells .
Furthermore , cocultivation of cells expressing membrane-bound forms of LT- « , 3 ; and TNF-a with U1 cells or the clustering of the LT-BR and TNFp75 receptors on U1 cells also greatly increases viral replication .
These studies thus indicate that signaling through the LT-B and TNF receptors in monocytes may influence HIV-1 viral burden and disease progression .
Furthermore , they suggest that strategies that inhibit TNF-a and LT-a , 3 , expression and signaling may be useful in decreasing HIV-1 viral burden and thus disease progression .
Materials and Methods Cell culture The following reagents were obtained from the AIDS Reference Reagents Program : CEM , Jurkat , and H9 cell lines .
The II-23 cell line was previously described ( 14 ) .
The U1 cell line ( 34 ) undergoes a time-dependent decay in the ability of TNF-a to induce HIV-1 replication as noted previously ( 33 , 34 ) .
We obtained U1 cells from the AIDS Repository , and U1 clones were isolated by limiting dilution and then selected for maximal responsiveness to TNF-a .
More than one clone was used in the experiments described with the U1 cell line , and results were comparable between clones .
Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FBS with L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
H9 cells were infected with the HIV-lyy strain at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 as previously described ( 35 , 36 ) and were analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of surface LT-a , B ; , or TNF- « .
Cells were preincubated with human serum for 20 min at 4°C , and all subsequent incuba-tions were performed at 4°C for 40 min each .
Cells were incubated with LT-BR-Fc or with the anti-TNF-a « Ab cAZ ( see Reagents below ) .
As a negative control , some cells were incubated with human IgG1 .
This was followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat anti-human ( F ( ab ' ) , ( Bio-Source , Camarillo , CA ) .
The Abs NC2 and CH12 ( see Reagents below ) were used as previously described ( 37 ) .
The human embryonic kidney cell line E293 , stably transfected with EBV nuclear Ag , was obtained from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA ) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS , L-glutamine , penicillin/ streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) , and 250 pg/ml G418 .
The p24 concentration was determined by ELISA according to the manufacturer 's specifications ( New England Nuclear-DuPont , Boston , MA ) .
Reagents The properties of the recombinant LT-a , B ; , ligand have been described previously ( 38 ) .
The anti-LT-BR Ab , CBE-11 ( 39 ) ; the anti-TNF-R75 Ab ( a gift from W. Lesslauer , Hoffmann-La Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) ( 40 ) ; and the anti-very late Ag-2 Ab , DEY ( a gift from J. Bergelson ) ( 41 ) have all been previously described .
The Abs NC2 and CH12 , which respectively recognized either all LT-o-containing forms or only LT- « , B , forms of surface LT , have also been described previously ( 37 ) .
The control Abs MOPC 21 ( a murine IgG1 ) and human IgG1 were obtained from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO ) .
Recombinant TNF-a was purchased from Genzyme ( Cam-bridge , MA ) .
The anti-TNF- « Ab , cA2 , and the isotype-matched control Ab were gifts from Centocor ( Malverne , CA ) .
The LT-BR-Fc and TNF-R55-Fc fusion proteins have been described previously ( 37 ) .
Receptor-Fc fusion proteins can lead to FcR binding , which can , in turn , stimulate monocytes to produce HIV-1 ( 42 ) , thereby complicating the analysis of inhibition by the fusion proteins .
To ensure that Fc receptor-mediated events did not complicate the analysis of spec-ificity , in some experiments an LT-BR-Fc construct lacking the CH2 domain was employed as a control .
This construct can not bind Fc receptors or fix complement , and its origin has been previously described ( 37 ) .
CHO cells were transfected with the resulting construct , and purified CH2-less LT-BR-Fc was purified from the CHO cell supernatants as previously described ( 37 ) .
Receptor cross-linking experiments Affinity-purified goat anti-IgG Fc ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) was immobilized on 24-well plates as described previously ( 39 , 43 ) and was incubated with the Abs noted in the figures .
U1 cells 6017 were plated on the washed plates at 2 X 10° cells/ml , and p24 values were measured from supernatants at 48 h. EMSA U1 cells were incubated for 2 h with or without 100 U/ml TNF-a or LT- « , B , at 50 ng/ml where indicated , nuclear extracts were prepared , and EMSAs were performed as previously described ( 44 ) .
The synthetic oli-gonucleotides used in the EMSA were : HIV-1-NF- « B , 5 `` -TCGACCG AGTGGGGACTTTCCTCTG-3 ' ( -61 to -27 nucleotides ) and 5'-GT TGAATGATTCTTTCCCCGCCCTCCTCTCGCCCCAGGGACA-3 ' .
DNA constructs and transfection The derivation of the vectors used for the expression of LT- « D50N and LT-B in E293 cells has been described ( 45 ) .
The wild-type human TNF-a gene was amplified from an activated cDNA library derived from I-23 cells using PCR primers designed to complement the 12 nucleotides or the last 12 nucleotides of the cDNA encoding TNF- @ .
The mutant membrane-retained form of human TNF- « was constructed from a genomic clone containing deletion of the first 12 TNF-a amino acids ( TNF ( AL-12 ) ; a gift from G. Kollias ) from which the TNF-a promoter was excised .
The wild type TNF-a @ and the mutant TNF ( A1-12 ) genes were then subcloned into the CH269 vector and verified by sequencing .
E293 cells were transfected with the CH269 vector alone , wild-type TNF- « , mutant membrane-bound TNF- or a combination of the LT-e ( D5ON ) , B , and LT- $ constructs using Lipofectamine ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for surface expression of LT- « ( D50N ) , B , and membrane-bound TNF- « .
After 48 h , transfected E293 cells were cocultured with U1 monocytes at a 5:1 E : T cell ratio for 75 h. In addition , supernatants from the transfected E293 cells were used to culture U1 cells for 72 h , and then U1 supernatants were analyzed from triplicate wells for HIV-1 p24 Ag production by ELISA .
To ensure that there was no secreted TNF- « in the supernatants of the E293 cells transfected with the mutant membrane-bound TNF- « plasmid , a TNF- ELISA was performed on these supernatants according to the specifications of the manufacturer ( Endogen , Woburn , MA ) .
The LT-BRFc ( 2.5 ug/ml ) , anti-TNF-a « cA2 Ab ( 2.5 ug/ml ) , and control human IgG1 ( 2.5 ug/ml ! )
were preincubated with E293 cells .
To exclude the presence of secreted or shed surface LT- ( D50N ) , B , ligand that could stimulate p24 expression , supernatants from cells treated as described above were assayed for LT cytotoxic activity using a HT29 cytotoxicity assay as previously described ( 38 ) .
Results LT-a , f ; stimulates HIV-1 replication in the UI monocytic cell line To test whether LT-a , 3 , could induce HIV-1 replication , we stimulated U1 cells with soluble LT- « , B ; , and quantified p24 Ag levels as a measure of HIV-1 replication .
As shown in Fig .
1 , stimulation of U1 cells with LT- « , B ; , at a concentration of 10 ng/ml resulted in a 2.8-fold increase in HIV-1 replication .
We note that concentrations of LT-a , B , between 10-50 ng/ml are in the linear range of the LT- « , 3 , dose response of U1 cells ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , a kinetic analysis of LT- « , 3 , stimulation of HIV-1 replication demonstrated a sustained increase in p24 levels in LT- & , 3 , U1 cells on days 7 , 14 , 18 , and 21 poststimulation ( data not shown ) .
By contrast , TNF-a treatment ( 1 ng/m ! )
of the cells resulted in peak p24 production on day 5 , which was sustained for a total of 14 days ( data not shown ) .
To verify that stimulation of HIV-1 by LT-a , , was mediated specifically by the LT- @ , 3 , ligand and not by LT-a ; , a potential contaminant that binds to and signals through the two TNF receptors but not through the LT-BR ( 46 ) , we employed a LT-BR decoy module .
The LT-BR decoy molecule is a LT-BR Ig Fc fusion protein that binds to and blocks the function of LT- @ , f ; , , but not LT-a , ( 46 ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , the LT-BR decoy molecule blocked LT-a , B , -mediated stimulation of HIV-1 replication , whereas a mAb to TNF-a did not .
Thus , the LT- « , 3 , effect is not secondary to stimulation of the TNF receptors through an LT- « ; 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6018 LT-B AND TNF- « STIMULATE HIV-1 REPLICATION IN U1 CELLS LToiB2 ._ 4 + 4 2000 15007 1000-7 500-7 I Conc .

LT-a , 8 ; stimulates HIV-1 replication in the U1 monocytic cell line .
The promyelomonocytic cell line , U1 , that is chronically infected with HIV-1 , was grown as previously described ( 34 ) .
Cells were treated with LT- « , B , ( 38 ) at 10 ng/ml or approximately 100 pM , the half-maximal stimulatory concentration of f , in these experiments , and p24 Ag levels were measured 48 h later .
The anti-TNF-a Ab cAZ at 5 pg/ml or the LT-BR-blocking Ab ( LT-BRFc-CH2-less ; 5 ug/ml ) was added to the cells as indicated .
There was no difference in cellular viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion between LT-o , , -treated and untreated U1 cells .
The results shown are consistent with three independent experiments .
The error bars represent the SD between duplicate values in the experiment displayed .
By flow cytometric analysis ( FACS ) we demonstrated that the U1 promyelomonocytic cell line expresses the LT-BR ( data not shown ) .
We note that addition of LT-o , 3 ; at a concentration of 10 ng/m !
resulted in an average 3- to 10-fold increase in HIV-1 replication dependent upon the particular U1 clone tested .
contaminant or by TNF-a itself ( 9 , 33 ) .
These results establish an independent pathway for LT- « , ; , signaling of HIV-1 in infected U1 cells .
LT-a , B , and TNF-a stimulate HIV-1 replication in a synergistic manner The effect of adding soluble TNF-a together with LT-a , B ; , to U1 cells was up to 10-fold greater than the effect of adding either cytokine alone ( Fig .
2 ) .
This functional cooperation can be blocked by an Ab to TNF-a ( data not shown ) or by TNFR55-Fc , a TNF- « receptor Fc decoy molecule ( Fig .
2 ) .
Treatment with either of these TNF-a Abs resulted in a decrease in p24 production to the level expected with LT-o , B , stimulation alone .
Similarly , the LTBR-Fc decoy molecule blocked the cooperative effect of LT-a , B , and TNF- « to the level of p24 production expected in U1 cells stimulated by TNF-a alone .
Stimulation of HIV-1 replication by the combination of TNF-a @ and LT- « , 3 , could be completely abrogated by treating the cells with a combination of the LT-BR-Fc and TNFR-Fc decoy molecules ( Fig .
2 ) .
Thus , LT- @ , B , and TNF-a act cooperatively to stimulate HIV-1 replication .
Surface , f , and TNF-a stimulate HIV-1 replication in UI cells Since the functional form of LT-a , $ 3 ; is membrane anchored ( 14 , 37 , 47 ) , and TNF-a occurs in both a membrane-bound and a soluble form , we next examined whether cellular contact with membrane-bound forms of LT- « , ; , and TNF-a also increased HIV-1 replication ( Fig .
3 ) .

LT-a , B ; , and TNF-a stimulate HIV-1 replication in a synergistic manner via distinct pathways .
U1 cells were grown in medium alone or in medium treated with TNF-a ( 1 ng/m ! )
or LT- « ; B ; , ( 10 ng/m ! )
plus TNF-a ( 1 ng/ml ) .
Cellular supernatants were harvested 48 h after treatment , and p24 Ag levels were measured in duplicate samples .
The blocking of HIV-1 replication stimulated by the combination of LT-a , B ; ( 10 ng/m ! )
and TNF-a ( 1 ng/m ! )
was achieved with 5 pg/ml TNFR55-Fc ( TNFR-Fc , which contains the 55-kDa TNF receptor fused to the Fc of human IgG1 ) or with 5 ug/ml LT-BRFc .
The results shown are consistent with three independent experiments .
The error bars represent the SD between duplicate values in the experiment displayed .
We note that concentrations of TNF-a > 50 pM are cytotoxic to U1 cells by trypan blue exclusion assay and to other chronically infected cell lines ( 10 ) .
Therefore , 1 ng/ml ( ~10 pM ) TNF-a was used , since it was not cytotoxic as assayed by trypan blue exclusion on day 2 ( data not shown ) .
membrane bound ( 12 ) and incapable of secretion to a soluble form .
These vectors were transiently transfected into E293 cells , and surface expression of the molecules was confirmed by FACS anal-ysis .
Similar to previous results ( 45 ) , at least 50 % of the cells were transfected and , in general , > 75 % were transfected with and expressed the indicated construct ( data not shown ) .
To ensure that there was no contamination by LT-a ; in the coculture experiment with the B , -expressing £293 cells , we cotransfected the expression vector along with the expression vector bearing the previously characterized mutation DSON , LT- « ( D50N ) .
The ( LT- « ( D50N ) ) mutation abolishes the ability of LT-a homotrimers to bind to the TNF-p55 and TNF-p75 receptors , and hence , any potential LT- « , breakdown product or LT-a , 3 , in E293 supernatants can not signal ( 38 ) .
We note that the ability of the molecule to bind to and signal through the LT-BR ( 38 ) is not affected .
Cocultivation of £293 cells expressing LT-a ( D50N ) , B , ( designated LT- & f in the figure ) stimulated HIV-1 replication in contiguous U1 monocytes , and the LT-BR decoy molecule specifically blocked induction of p24 production ( Fig .
34 ) .
Identical results were obtained in a cocultivation experiment using insect cells expressing LT- @ ( D50N ) ; , B , following infection with a baculovirus vector encoding LT- « ( D50N ) ; B ; , ( data not shown ) .
These experiments demonstrate that signaling through the LT-BR via the membrane-bound LT-a « , B ; , ligand stimulates HIV-1 replication .
Cocultivation of E293 cells expressing either the wild-type and , therefore , secretable TNF-a ( wt-TNF ) or the membrane-bound TNF-a ( mTNF ) molecule stimulated HIV-1 replication in U1 cells to a similar degree ( Fig .
3B ) .

All data are presented as the mean + SEM of at least three independent experiments .

The anti-TNF-a Ab cA2 ( 5 ug/ml ! )
was used to block the effect of TNF-a on HIV-1 replication .
E293 cells transfected with the vector encoding the wt-TNF-a « molecule expressed both membrane-bound ( as determined by FACS ; data not shown ) and soluble TNF-a as shown in C and D. C and D , Membrane-bound LT-a , B ; and TNF-a are not secreted .

Similarly , an anti-LT-BR agonist Ab , which clusters the LT-BR , can elicit LT-BR-mediated biological functions in tissue culture ( 39 , 48 ) .
As shown in Fig .
4 , specific clustering of the LT-BR on the surface of U1 cells also stimulated HIV-1 replication , as did clustering of the p75 TNF receptor .
By contrast , a control Ig-matched Ab did not increase p24 levels above baseline ( data not shown ) .
Notably , simultaneous clustering of both LT-BR and p75 TNF receptor resulted in a marked enhancement of HIV-1 replication compared with that after engagement of either receptor alone .
Thus , soluble and membrane-bound forms of LT-a , 3 , and TNF-a or the specific engagement of their cognate receptors result in cooperative stimulation of HIV-1 replication .
TNF-a , but not induces NF- « B binding activity in UI cells TNF-a « causes the nuclear translocation of NF- « B ( reviewed in Ref .
49 ) , and the binding of NF-KB to the HIV-LTR is thought to mediate TNF- « -induced HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in U1 cells ( 33 ) .
In some cell lines LT-a ; 3 , also causes the nuclear translocation of NF- « B ( 48 , 50 ) .
Thus , we explored whether the mechanism of LT- « , 3 , -mediated stimulation of HIV-1 replication in U1 cells involved NF-KB .
Specifically , we stimulated U1 cells r -- HIV- « B - _ -- -61/-27- NFB PAJ U4 | h id u 1 2 8 4 5 6 7 8 FIGURE 5 .

A TNF -- inducible complex binds to the HIV-1-NFxB site oligonucleotide probe ( Zanes I and 2 ) , whereas there is no inducible complex observed after LT- @ , B ; stimulation .
An oligonucleotide probe matching the sequences spanning between -61 and -28 relative to the human TNF-a cap site containing an Spl site was used as a control for protein loading and processing of the EMSA .
The experiment displayed is representative of three experiments performed in three independent U1 clones .
We note that HIV-1 p24 levels were inducible by both TNF-a and LT-a , B ; in all three clones ( data not shown ) .
with LT- « , 3 , and/or TNF-a , prepared nuclear extracts , and performed an EMSA using an NF-KB site from the HIV-1 LTR as a probe .
As shown in Fig .
5 , TNF-a caused the induction of NF-kB binding activity ( Zanes 2 and 4 ) , whereas treatment with LT-o , B , at concentrations that stimulate an increase in p24 production did not result in detectable inducible NF- « B binding activity ( Zane 3 ) .
Thus , the observed cooperation between and TNF- @ raises the possibility that another undefined HIV-1 transcriptional activation pathway is stimulated via the LT-BR receptor .
HIV-1 infection stimulates LT-a , B ; expression on the surface of H9 T cells .
To determine whether HIV-1 infection up-regulates LT- « , B ; , expression on T cells , we screened a panel of T cell lines for the effect of HIV-1 infection on surface expression of LT-a , , .
We infected the T cell hybridoma I-23 and the T cell lines CEM , Jurkat , and H9 with the HIV-1 MN strain at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 and analyzed these cells 4 days later by flow cytometry for surface LT-a , B , expression .
HIV-1 infection did not induce LT-a , 3 , surface expression on CEM , Jurkat , or I-23 cells ( data not shown ) .
However , in the case of the H9 cell line , HIV-1 infection did cause a reproducible increase in LT-a , B , surface expression 4 days after infection ( Fig .
6 ) , whereas HIV-1 infection had no effect on surface TNF-a expression ( data not shown ) .
To demonstrate that the functional LT-a , f , heterotrimer is specifically up-regulated by HIV-1 infection , we stained H9 cells with the Abs NC2 and CH12 .
The NC2 Ab recognizes all forms , whereas CH12 specifically recognizes the surface LT- @ , fB ; forms .
As shown in Fig .
6 , the NCZ Ab , but not the CH12 Ab , recognizes the inducible LT complex , indicating that B ; , is up-regulated by HIV-1 infection of H9 cells .

3 g Bo Bl s s 2 g “ a 8-s 5 CH12 i 6s 40 Discussion We have shown that HIV-1 replication can be triggered by LT-BR activation alone and that it is cooperatively stimulated when the distinct LT-BR and TNF receptor systems are simultaneously engaged on monocytes .
Monocytes and the monocytic dendritic/re-ticular network of cells bear the CCR5 chemokine receptor , which is used by HIV-1 for cellular entry ( 51-53 ) .
In the secondary lymphoid tissues , dendritic cells can sequester up to 90 % of the total HIV-1 viral burden on their cellular surfaces ( 30 ) and are important in transmitting HIV-1 to T cells ( 54 ) .
Thus , our demonstration that LT-a , B , and TNF-a @ cooperatively stimulate HIV-1 replication may suggest an important host mechanism for regulating HIV-1 viral burden in monocytic cells , which are critical to HIV-1 infection and progression .
Interestingly , activation of the LT-BR potentiates TNF- « -medi-ated cell death ( 55 ) , providing a precedent for cooperative interactions between the two receptor systems .
In certain cell types , LT-BR signaling results in NF-KB activation via the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor-3 ( TRAF3 ) and -5 ( 56 ) .
NF-kB translocation secondary to TNFR p55 signaling involves TRAF2 ( 57 ) , and TRAF1 is involved in TNFR p75-induced NF- « B modulation ( 58 ) .
We were not able to detect LT-BR-mediated induction of NF- « B in U1 cells , suggesting that either the levels of NF- « B induced by the LT-BR in U1 cells are too low for detection 40 3 ' A on 00 Vh O C3 1 2 10 10 10 10 10 FL1-Height 10 FL1-Height by EMSA or that HIV-1 stimulation by LT-BR may be NF- « B independent .
These results are consistent with the observation that synergistic activation of HIV replication by other cytokine combinations acts at different transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps in the HIV-1 life cycle ( 7 ) .
Notably , the LT-BR-stimulated pathway differs from that mediated by the TNF receptors in that it is mediated by different intracellular TRAFs .
Perhaps in the case of HIV-1 replication , the recruitment of a different set of TRAFs by the LT-BR results in the activation of a distinct signal transduction pathway that is complementary to the signal transduction pathways activated by TNF- @ .
The results of our cocultivation experiments with 6293 cells expressing membrane-bound TNF-a are in contrast to results obtained in another study using CHO or 3T3 cells stably transfected with a membrane-bound form of TNF-a and then cocultured with latently infected ACH-2 T cells or HIV-1-infected PBLs ( 59 ) .
In this study the target cells appeared to preferentially undergo apoptosis and down-regulation of HIV-1 replication when they were cocultivated with a membrane-anchored form of TNF-a .
The differences between this study and ours might be attributed to the fact that in the study by Lazdins et al .
100 % of the stably transfected CHO and 3T3 cells would be expected to express membrane-bound TNF-a @ .
Since a wt-TNF-a @ -expressing cell line was not employed in their cocultivation experiments as a control , it is not 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6022 LT-B AND TNF- « STIMULATE HIV-1 REPLICATION IN U1 CELLS possible to determine whether the level of TNF-a expression in the transfected cells was toxic to the HIV-1-infected cells , thus causing cell death .
Since HIV-1-infected monocytes are particularly numerous in lymph nodes and spleen , where they are in intimate contact with T cells in the early stages of HIV-1 infection ( 31 ) , it is intriguing to speculate that activated lymphocytes expressing surface LT- , B ; , or TNF-a forms may play an important role in promoting HIV-1 replication in contiguous monocytes .
Early HIV-1 infection is characterized by lymphadenopathy ( 29 , 60 ) , splenomegaly , and lymphocyte activation ( 61-63 ) .
In fact , disturbances of lymphoid organs are among the earliest changes observed in HIV-1 infection ( 31 , 30 , 64 ) .
However , as HIV-1 infection progresses with concomitant T cell death , the total lymphoid tissue in the infected host dramatically decreases ( 29 , 65 ) .
Interestingly , perturbations of the LT- « , , and TNF-a ligand receptor systems also cause disturbances in the lymphoid cells and organs .
The LT-B signaling pathway is required for lymph node organogenesis and lymphoid architecture in the developing mouse , and the loss of LT-B signaling in normal adult mice leads to an altered splenic marginal zone and the collapse of follicular dendritic cell ( FDC ) networks in both spleen and lymph nodes ( 18 , 22 ) .
TNF-a is also involved in the generation of FDCs and the formation of splenic germinal centers and functions as an autocrine B cell growth factor ( 24-28 ) .
Perhaps early in HIV-1 infection , the up-regulation of LT-a , B ; , together with membrane-bound TNF-a in HIV-1-infected lymphocytes acts to stimulate lymphoid proliferation and dendritic cell maturation .
It is interesting to speculate that as rounds of HIV-1 replication are cooperatively driven by the TNF- « @ and LT-o , B , signaling pathways , and HIV-1 infection progresses to AIDS , the virus destroys LT-a , , -bearing T cells and a crucial lymphoid architectural signal is lost .
