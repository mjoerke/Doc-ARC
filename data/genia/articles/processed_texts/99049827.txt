Pernis® CD40 activation of B cells is strongly influenced by the presence of cytokines .
However , the molecular basis for the interplay between these distinct stimuli is not clearly delineated .
IFN regulatory factor 1 ( IRF-1 ) is a transcription factor activated by either CD40 or cytokines .
We have found that these different sets of signals target a common cis-acting element in the promoter of this gene , the IRF-1 gamma-activated site ( GAS ) .
Targeting of the IRF-1 GAS is not confined to activation via CD40 but extends to other stimuli that mimic the CD40 signaling cascade , like TNF-a and EBV .
In contrast to induction of STATs by cytokines , the IRF-1 GAS-binding complex activated by CD40 , TNF-a , or EBV contains Rel proteins , specifically p50 and p65 .
In this system , simultaneous exposure to CD4O0L together with either IL-4 or IFN-y does not lead to the activation of novel Re/STAT complexes .
Given the importance of IRF-1 in a variety of biologic functions from proliferation to apoptosis , our findings support the notion that modulation of IRF-1 levels may be a critical control point in B cell activation .
5997-6004. plays a critical role in shaping the proliferative and dif- ferentiative outcomes of B cells ( 1-4 ) .
Stimulation of B cells by CD40 cross-linking is significantly enhanced by the presence of cytokines , in particular IL-4 .
However , the molecular basis underlying the cross-talk between CD40- and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways has not been clearly delineated .
CD40 shares structural and functional features with members of the TNF family of receptors ( 5 , 6 ) .
Despite significant sequence divergence within their intracytoplasmic domain , distinct members of this family of receptors signal through similar components ( 7 ) .
Specifically , many of these receptors associate with a family of proteins termed TRAFs ( TNFR-associated factors ) ( 8 , 9 ) .
Discovery of this family of molecules has revealed that the ability of EBV to successfully immortalize human B cells may rely , in part , on the capacity of one of the viral proteins , Latent membrane protein 1 , to associate with TRAF molecules and thus constitutively activate the CD40 signaling pathway ( 10 ) .
In addition to the TRAFs , CD40 and other members of the TNF family of receptors also activate the NF- « B/Rel family of transcription factors ( 9 , 11-13 ) .
NF- « B plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional regulation of many genes critical to immune and inflammatory responses ( 14 , 15 ) .
The generation of mice lacking individual Rel family members has indicated that many Rel pro T he interaction between CD40 and its ligand ( CD4O0L ) Department of Medicine , Columbia University , New York , NY 10032 Received for publication January 20 , 1998 .

For instance , B cells from the p50 knockout ( ko ) are unable to switch to specific isotypes , while their proliferative responses to anti-CD40 Abs are intact ( 16 ) .
In contrast , B cells from the RelB ko demonstrate defective proliferative responses to CD40 stimulation , but undergo normal Ig class switching ( 17 ) .
Thus , different Rel family members may be involved in distinct signaling pathways in response to CD40 .
Recruitment of similar signaling components by different members of a family of receptors is also a well-known feature of the cytokine receptor superfamily , which includes IL-4R ( 18 , 19 ) .
Many of these receptors signal by following the paradigm originally described for the IFN signal transduction pathway ( 20 ) .
This pathway involves the activation , via JAK kinases , of latent cytoplasmic proteins belonging to the STAT family of proteins .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of the STATs allows them to associate in complexes that can then translocate into the nucleus where they modulate gene transcription by binding to distinct DNA elements termed GAS ( gamma-activated sites ) .
Unlike other GAS elements , the GAS in the IFN regulatory factor 1 ( IRF-1 ) promoter displays high-affinity binding for STAT complexes activated in response to a variety of cytokines ( 21-23 ) .
IRF-1 is a member of a growing family of transcription factors whose members bind a related enhancer but impart contrasting effects on the transactivation of genes ( 24 ) .
For exam-ple , the ratio of IRF-1 and another IRF member , IRF-2 , has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of cellular proliferation ( 25 ) .
Additionally , IRF-1 is involved in apoptosis ( 26 , 27 ) as well as in the development and function of a variety of immune effector cells ( 28-32 ) .
We have been interested in understanding the cross-talk between CD40 and cytokine signaling pathways in B cells .
We have found that signals triggered by CD40 , or by stimuli that mimic the CD40 signaling cascade , like TNF-a and EBV , activate complexes that can bind to the GAS element of the IRF-1 promoter .
However , the IRF-1 GAS-binding complexes activated by CD40 , TNF- @ , and EBV do not contain known STAT complexes but employ 0022-1767/98/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 5998 members of the Rel/NF- « B family , specifically p50 and p65 .
Targeting of a common cis-acting element by different pathways may thus allow a cell to integrate multiple incoming signals .

The isotype matched control mAb was purchased from PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) .
Cell culture Ramos B cells ( 50-80 X 10° ) were added to plates containing CD4OL tx or CD8 tx cells ( 20 X 10° and then incubated at 37°C for varying periods of times in a final volume of 10 ml .
Coculture with other cell lines followed the same protocol .
Cytokine treatments were conducted simultaneously in separate plates in a final volume of 10 ml utilizing the following cytokine concentrations : human IL-4 ( 100 U/ml ; a kind gift of Dr. Paul Rothman , Columbia University ) , human IFN-y ( 10 ng/ml ; PeproTech , Rocky Hill , NJ ) , human TNF-a ( 20 ng/ml ; PeproTech ) , and human IFN- ( 100 U/ml ; a generous gift of Dr. Chris Schindler ) .
In experiments where Ramos cells were stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb , 20 X 10° cells were activated with 1 pg/ml of Ab in a final volume of 2 ml .
Treatment of Ramos cells with TPCK ( N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone ) was performed as previously described ( 36 ) .
Briefly , 50 X 10° cells were incubated with 25 pg of TPCK for 1 h before incubation with either CD40L or CD8 tx for 2 h. Treatment with cycloheximide was performed as previously described ( 21 ) .
UV cross-linking UV cross-linking was performed as previously described ( 37 ) except that the gel shift reactions were conducted at 25°C and irradiated twice with CONVERGENCE OF SIGNALS BY TNF- AND CYTOKINE-RECEPTOR FAMILIES 1000 mJ of UV administered with a Stratalinker ( Ultra-violet Products , Cambridge , UK ) .
Cross-linked DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using either a p65 or a Stat3 antiserum ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .

The blot was probed with either a human IRF-1 cDNA ( kindly provided by Dr. Richard Pine ) or a glycer-aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) cDNA radiolabeled with the Pharmacia DNA Labelling beads ( -dCTP ) kit ( Pharmacia Biotech , Pis-cataway , NJ ) .
Results Induction of an IRF-1 GAS-binding complex by CD40 , TNF- « , or EBV To investigate the effects of CD40 stimulation on cytokine signaling pathways , we cocultured cells from Ramos , an EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line , together with 293 cells stably transfected either with human CD4O0L ( CD4OL tx ) or with CD8 ( CDS tx ) as a negative control ( 8 ) .
After harvesting the cells , we prepared whole cell extracts and assayed them by EMSA using as a probe the GAS element from the IRF-1 promoter .
We have previously used this site to detect the induction of a variety of STAT complexes in response to different cytokines ( 21 ) .
A functional CD40/CD40L interaction was confirmed by detecting CD23 up-regulation via FACS ( data not shown ) .
These experiments revealed that stimulation of Ramos cells with CD4O0L tx but not with CD8 tx led to the appearance of a novel DNA-binding complex ( Fig .
1A ) .
Similar results were obtained by using an Ab to CD40 ( G28-5 ) rather than the CD4OL transfectants , confirming that induction of this complex was a direct effect of the CD4O0/CDA4OL interaction ( Fig .
1A ) .
Activation of this €CD4O-inducible complex was observed in a variety of B cell lines ( BL-2 , BJAB ) as well as in a monocytic cell line , THP-1 , which is known to respond to CD40 activation ( Fig .
1A and data not shown ) .
Consistent with the finding that both TNF-a and EBV utilize signaling pathways similar to those triggered by CD40 , a comparable IRF-1 GAS-binding complex was observed upon stimulation of Ramos cells with TNF-a @ or constitutively in EBV transformed B cell lines ( WIL-2 and JY ) ( Fig .
1B ) .
Kinetic experiments revealed that both CD40- and ducible complexes were activated within 15 min after the stimulation of Ramos cells and lasted up to 48 h. Coculturing Ramos cells with CD4OL transfectants in the presence of cycloheximide enhanced the induction of the complex ( data not shown ) .
The addition of an antiphosphotyrosine Ab to the EMSA reactions did not significantly affect the appearance of this complex ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these data are consistent with the notion that utilization of related signaling pathways by CD40 , TNF- @ , and EBV is reflected in the activation of similar DNA-binding complexes .
Furthermore , the rapid activation of these factors as well as their resistance to protein synthesis inhibitors suggest that these complexes are composed of latent cytoplasmic factors .
The CD4O0- , TNF-a @ - , and EBV-inducible complexes binding to the IRF-1 GAS do not contain known STAT complexes Although some GAS elements ( e.g .
, the IRF-1 and B-CAS GAS ) can bind a variety of STAT complexes , other GAS sequences ( e.g .
, the Ie GAS ) exhibit exquisite specificity for distinct STAT complexes ( 21 ) .

WCE were simultaneously obtained from untreated WIL-2 ( W ) or JY cells .
The WCE were assayed as described above .
complex activated in response to CD40 or TNF- @ , we performed EMSA experiments using a panel of different GAS elements ( 21 ) as cold competitors of the radiolabeled IRF-1 GAS probe ( Table I ) .
Although the Ie GAS and the ICAM-1 GAS are derived from the promoters of CD40- and/or TNF-a-responsive genes , neither of these elements competed for the complex induced by CD40 or TNF- « ( Fig .
24 ) .
As described previously ( 21 ) , these elements adequately competed for the IL-4-inducible Stat6 homodimer ( 34 , 38-40 ) and/or the IFN-y-inducible Statl homodimer ( 41 ) ( Fig .

The distinctive competition pattern displayed by the CD4O0-inducible complex raises the possibility that this complex might not contain known STAT complexes .
Another CD40 target gene , CD23 , exists as two different iso-forms , CD23a and CD23b , whose expression is controlled by separate promoters ( 42 ) .
Both of these promoters contain GAS elements .
Interestingly , when these GAS elements were tested , only the oligonucleotide containing the CD23b GAS was able to compete with the CD4O0-inducible complex ( Fig .
2B ) .
In contrast to this selective effect , both the CD23a and CD23b GAS blocked the appearance of the IL-4-inducible Stat6 homodimer , while neither the CD23a GAS nor the CD23b GAS affected the Table I .

Oligonucleotide competition assays were performed either in the absence or in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of cold NF-KB oligonucleotides added to the shift reaction as indicated .
Competitors included IL-2Ra « NF-KB , HIV long terminal repeat NF- « B , IRE-1 GAS .
To confirm the absence of STAT proteins in the CD4O0- and TNF- « -inducible complex , we analyzed these complexes by supershift experiments with a panel of antisera against STAT 1 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) and against Stat2 ( Fig .
3C ) .
In each case , the Ab supershifted complexes known to contain specific STAT 's , but none of the antisera affected the €CD4O0- or the TNF- & -inducible complex .
Similar results were obtained when different STAT antisera were utilized to supershift the constitutive complex detected in EBV-transformed B cells lines ( data not shown ) .
Other groups have employed immunoprecipitation assays to detect the activation of Stat3 and Stat6 in response to CD40 ( 43 , 44 ) .
To confirm the lack of STAT activation in our system , we thus performed immunoprecipitations with either a Stat6 or a Stat3 antiserum on extracts from CD4O-stimulated Ramos cells .
Despite adequate STAT activation in response to appropriate cytokine stimulation , we failed to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of either Stat3 or Stat6 upon CD40 stimulation ( data not shown ) .
The lack of Stat6 phosphorylation in response to CD40 was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation of extracts from a different Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line , BL-41 ( data not shown ) .
These results , thus , suggest that the complex we detect in response to CD40 , TNF-a , or EBV is likely to be composed of non-STAT proteins .
The CD4O-inducible complex binding to the IRF-1 GAS contains NF- « B-related proteins The rapid induction of the CD4O-inducible complex as well as its resistance to cycloheximide treatment suggested the presence of a latent cytoplasmic factor within the complex .
Given the known ability of CD40 cross-linking to activate NF-KB ( 11 ) , and the partial overlap of the IRF-1 GAS element with an NF- « B consensus site ( Table I ) , we entertained the idea that this inducible complex might indeed be composed of Rel family members .
Oligonucleotide competitions revealed that known NF-KB sites ( 15 ) were able to effectively compete for this CD4O0-inducible complex but not for the known STAT complexes ( Fig .
4 ) .
Ab supershifting experiments with a panel of commercially available Rel antisera confirmed this finding and demonstrated that the CD4O0-inducible complex contains both p50 and p65 ( RelA ) or antigenically related proteins ( Fig .
5 ) .
In contrast , neither the IL-4- nor the IFN-y-inducible complexes were affected by these antisera ( data not shown ) .

An identical pattern of competition was also displayed by both the TNF- « @ -inducible complex and the constitutive complex detected in EBV-transformed B cell lines ( Fig .

Consistent with these results , activation of the CD4O0-inducible complex was prevented by pretreatment with TPCK , a proteasome inhibitor known to block degradation of IxB- « and thus p50/p65 translocation and activation ( data not shown ) ( 36 ) .
The induction of p65 binding to the IRF-1 promoter in both CD40L-treated Ramos cells as well as in an EBV-transformed B cell line ( JY ) was further confirmed by subjecting these DNA-binding complexes to UV cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitations with a p65 antiserum ( See Fig .

A , Cells were stimulated with either CD4O0L tx , control tx , human IFN-y ( 10 ng/ml ) , or human IL-4 ( 100 U/ml ! )
either alone or in combina-tion .
Extracts were then prepared and analyzed as described in Fig .

B , Ab interference mobility shift assays were conducted by addition of either an antiserum against Staté or a preimmune serum ( control ) .
Antisera were added as described in Fig .
3. probing of the filter with a p65 antiserum ensured for equal loading of the immunoprecipitates ( Fig .
6 , lower panel ) .
Thus , these studies indicate that , at the IRF-1 promoter , induction of NF- « B by CD40 stimulation converges on the same regulatory region targeted by cytokine signals .
Simultaneous treatment of B cells with CD40 and cytokines does not lead to the formation of novel complexes at the IRF-1 promoter Given the ability of the IRF-1 GAS to function as a common binding site for distinct transcription factors , we evaluated whether simultaneous treatment with CD4O0L and cytokines would lead to the formation of a novel complex between STAT 's and Rel proteins .
As shown in Fig .
7A , exposure of Ramos cells to CD4OL transfectants together with either IL-4 or IFN-y did not lead to the induction of an additional STAT/Rel complex or to changes in the mobility of the individual complexes .
Moreover , supershifting experiments with a Stat6é Ab ( Fig .
7B ) demonstrated that only the IL-4-inducible complex contains Stat6 .
These results suggest that , at the IRF-1 GAS , STAT and Rel proteins appear to be maintained as separate entities .
Alternatively , these two distinct classes of transcription factors may bind this DNA element as alternate complexes .
Functional consequences of NF-kB binding to the IRF-1 GAS To determine whether CD40 stimulation could lead to the induction of IREF-1 in our system , we examined the RNA obtained from Ramos cells after stimulation for different lengths of time with 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; IRF-1 TIME : 45 ' 2h 45° 2h 45 ' 2h 2h 45 2h TX - - control CO40L TNF-a IFN- IFN-y tx tx B control tx CD40L tx ( s IFN-y Wl ~ _ _ `` FIGURE 8 .
Induction of IRF-1 in response to CD40 or TNF-a stimulation in Ramos but not in THP-1 cells .
A , Ramos cells were stimulated with either CD4O0L tx , control tx , human TNF-a ( 20 ng/m ! )
, human IFN-a ( 100 U/ml ) , or human IFN-y ( 10 ng/m ! )
for either 45 min or 2 h. Total RNA was then extracted , and 10 pg of the RNA was assayed by Northern blotting as per standard protocols .
The blot was then probed with either an IRF-1 cDNA ( upper panel ) or GAPDH cDNA radiolabeled by random hexamer priming .
B , THP-1 cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with CD4O0L tx , control tx , human IFN- ( 100 U/m !
1 ) , or human IFN-y ( 10 ng/ml ) for 45 min .
Total RNA was then extracted and assayed as described in A. CD40L tx , control tx , or TNF-a .
Northern analysis of these samples revealed that stimulation of Ramos cells for 45 min with CD40L or TNF-a led , respectively , to a fivefold and threefold induction of IRF-1 expression as measured by densitometry ( Fig .
8A ) .
This induction was short-lived because it had diminished by 2 h and was undetectable at 24 h ( data not shown ) .
Exposure to IFN-y led to a stronger up-regulation of IRF-1 that lasted up to 24 h. In contrast , CD40 stimulation did not lead to IRF-1 up-regulation in a monocytic cell line THP-1 , despite activating an NF- « B complex by EMSA and despite the ability of this cell line to up-regulate IRF-1 in response to IFNs ( Fig .
8B ) .
Thus , although CD40 and cytokine signals converge on similar target genes , utilization of distinct components by each cascade allows for varying levels of responsiveness .
Moreover , cell type-specific constraints may modulate whether a response will take place .
Discussion Our studies demonstrate that incoming signals provided by stimulation of B cells by the TNF- or the cytokine-receptor families target the GAS element of the IRF-1 promoter .
In our experimental system , distinct classes of transcription factors are utilized by the different receptor families , Rel proteins in the case of CD40 , EBV , or TNF-a and STAT 's in the case of cytokines .
It is important to point out that among other GAS elements tested only an oligonucleotide containing the CD23b GAS appears to function as a composite NF- « B/STAT binding element ( Fig .
2B ) .
Given the fact that the DNA elements encompassing the IRF-1 and CD23b GAS differ in the location of potential « B sites ( Table 1 ) , subtle differences in CONVERGENCE OF SIGNALS BY TNF- AND CYTOKINE-RECEPTOR FAMILIES the interaction between NF-KB and STAT complexes at these GAS elements may , however , exist .
Interestingly , the differential ability of oligonucleotides containing the CD23a and CD23b GAS to mediate NF- « B binding correlates with a differential regulation of the two CD23 isoforms in response to CD40 and/or IL-4 ( our unpublished observation ) .
Thus , the ability of a GAS element to mediate binding of both NF- « B and STATs may reflect specific regulatory requirements .
The simultaneous targeting of the IRF-1 GAS by Rel and STAT proteins suggests that regulation of the transcription factor IRF-1 may represent a critical control point in the progression of B cells toward proliferation and/or other differentiative pathways .
Although only a modest induction of IRF-1 is detected in response to CD40 , recent studies have demonstrated that small changes in the levels of transactivators may be translated into transcriptional synergy because of cooperative interactions within multiprotein enhancer complexes ( 45 ) .
Thus , activation of both NF-KB and IRF-1 by CD40 may lead to the formation of a transcriptional complex that then may target additional CD4O-responsive genes .
It must also be pointed out that IRF-1 can mediate growth inhibition ( 25 ) , and overexpression of IRF-1 in B cells is deleterious to B cell development ( 46 ) .
Thus , the modest induction of IRF-1 in response to CD40 may allow for the activation of additional target genes without endangering the proliferative capability of B cells .
Consistent with this hypothesis , we have found that up-regulation of IRF-1 in response to CD40 is followed by a much stronger induction of the recently cloned IRF-4 ( also termed ICSAT , Pip , LSIRF , or MUMI1 ( 47-50 ) ) ( S. Gupta et al .
, manuscript in prep-aration ) .
IRF-4 is likely to play a key role in B cell biology as evidenced by the fact that IRF-4 ko mice display significant defects in mature B cell functions ( 51 ) .
An investigation of the IRF-4 promoter has revealed potential NF- « B- and IRF-1-binding se-quences .
Interestingly , CD40 stimulation of THP-1 cells , which leads to the induction of NF- « B but not of IRF-1 , is not accompanied by the up-regulation of IRF-4 .
The finding that similar IRF-1 GAS-binding complexes are activated in response to CD40 , TNF-a , or EBV stimulation is further evidence that the biologic overlap demonstrated by these stimuli on B cells ( 2 , 3 , 52 , 53 ) is reflected in the common usage of a similar set of signaling mechanisms .
Given the ability of IRF-1 to act as a tumor suppressor gene and inhibit cell growth ( 25 ) , modulation of IRF-1 levels by EBV may play an important role in the viral immortalization process .
In addition , because IRFs play a key role in the complex transcriptional regulation of EBNA-1 ( 54-56 ) , a viral protein critical for maintenance of EBV latency ( 53 ) , the targeting of IRF-1 by EBV may reflect the virus 's own need to carefully control the balance of distinct IRFs within a B cell .
CD40 stimulation has been previously reported to activate Rel-containing complexes in both human and murine B cell lines ( 11 , 57 ) .
However , these complexes differ from the one detected at the IRF-1 GAS with respect to the pattern of bands as well as Rel antisera competitions .
Thus , the particular nucleotide sequence of the IRF-1 GAS allows for the differential recognition of this site by a specific Rel complex .
Because the expression of Rel complexes changes with terminal B cell differentiation ( 58-60 ) , the precise maturation stage of a B cell might modulate the ability of the CD40 signaling pathway to target this gene .
Preliminary studies with purified recombinant p50 and p65 have confirmed the ability of these proteins to bind to this element in the absence of additional factors ( data not shown ) .
However , the regulation of IRF-1 by CD40 is likely to be complex .
Indeed , CD40 stimulation of a monocytic cell line , THP-1 , albeit leading to the induction of an IRF-1 GAS-binding complex , is not accompanied by IRE-1 transactivation .
In addition , transactivation of the IRF-1 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology gene in response to CD40 is short-lived , although binding of the p50/p65 heterodimer to the IRF-1 GAS can be detected even up to 48 h. Thus , additional factors are likely to modulate the transactivation potential of Rel family members at this promoter .
In contrast to published reports ( 43 , 44 ) , we have been unable to demonstrate the presence of known STAT proteins , in particular of Stat3 and Stat6 , in response to CD40 or TNF-a stimulation as well as in the constitutive complexes found in EBV-transformed B cell lines .
While these studies were in progress , two other groups also reported that , in non-lymphoid cells , TNF-a can activate an IRF-1 GAS-binding complex that contains Rel proteins ( 61 , 62 ) .
The reason for our inability to detect activation of either Stat3 or Stat6 in response to CD40 is at present unclear .
Potential explanations include the fact that different human cell lines as well as different culture conditions/stimulations were used .
Because we can detect induction of IRF-1 , €D23 , ICAM-1 , and Fas in response to CD40 ( data not shown ) , our results suggest that , despite the intrinsic ability of CD4OR to trigger multiple signaling pathways , activation of selected target genes may not require the full complement of signal-transducing factors .
The interaction between NF- « B/Rel proteins and STATs has been shown to have diametrically opposite effects in different experimental settings .
While synergism between NF- « B and Stat6 was postulated at the murine germline epsilon promoter ( 57 ) , antagonism between these two factors was found at the E-selectin promoter ( 63 ) .
Preliminary studies show that simultaneous targeting of Rel family members and STAT 's to the IRF-1 GAS does not appear to lead to either increased transcriptional activation or repression of the IRF-1 gene .
However , the real in vivo significance for the Rel/STAT interaction at the IRF-1 GAS might require simultaneous exposure of cells to multiple stimuli .
For instance , in the presence of IL-4 , IFN-y does not inhibit but rather enhances B cell proliferation induced by CD4O0L ( 64 ) .
Given the involvement of IRF-1 in growth inhibition ( 25 ) , the simultaneous presence of NF- « B and Stat6 at the IRF-1 GAS may prevent or modulate the ability of Statl to induce IRF-1 .
Thus , it appears that the precise context of the Rel/STAT interaction rather than the interaction per se will dictate the final functional outcome .
