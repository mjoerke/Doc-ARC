Effect of thymosin on glucocorticoid receptor activity and glucocorticoid sensitivity of human thymocytes D.D.F .
MA , A. H. HO & A. V. HOFFBRAND Department of Haematology , Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine , Hampstead , London , UK ( Accepted for publication 10 October 1983 ) SUMMARY Incubation with thymosin fraction 5 , ( TMS F5 at 300 ug/ml ) a partially purified thymic factor , reduced the steroid binding activity of human infant thymocytes from 9:6 +21 fmole/ml to 5:0+2-0 fmole/ml .
The glucocorticoid receptor activity in normal infant thymocytes was found to be 2,146 +726 ( s.d . )
sites per cell with dissociation constant of 1-4+0-6x 10- 'm .
TMS F5 also increased the resistance of human thymocytes to the cytolytic effect of dexamethasone ( 2:5 x 10-®m ) to 168:6 + 30-2 % of control ( P < 0-01 ) .
In animals , medullary and peripheral blood T cells are more resistant to glucocorticoids than immature thymic T cells .
The results show that thymosin can induce changes consistent with differentiation in human thymocytes .
These in vitro results are consistent with a physiological role of thymosin in intrathymic T cell maturation in man .
Incubation of a human malignant thymus derived T cell line ( MOLT 3 ) with TMS F5 also resulted in a significant reduction of the number of steroid binding sites to 442+ 15-3 % of control ( P < 0-05 ) , but TMS F5 did not significantly reduce the glucocorticoid sensitivity of MOLT 3 cells .
Keywords human thymocytes glucocorticoid receptors thymosin INTRODUCTION Studies in animals have shown that two major classes of T cells can be distinguished in the thymus ; immunoincompetent , glucocorticoid sensitive cortical thymocytes and immunocompetent , glucocorticoid resistant medullary thymocytes .
Thymic T cell precursors are also thought to be resistant to glucocorticoids ( Claman , 1972 ) .
The action of glucocorticoids is a multiple step process which involves specific intracellular receptors ( Higgins & Gehring , 1978 ) .
The inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids may be related to the number of specific glucocorticoid receptor sites ( Baxter et al .
, 1971 ; Rosenau et al .
, 1972 ) .
However , studies on HeLa cells ( Cidlowski & Michaels , 1977 ) and mitogen stimulated human lymphocytes ( Smith et al .
, 1977 ) have shown that receptor number correlates with proliferative stage and may not determine glucocorticoid sensitivity of the cells .
The cellular effects of glucocorticoids are likely to be dependent on additional factors .
Several thymic factors have been isolated from thymus and serum ( reviewed by Goldstein et a/ .
, 1981 ) .
Experimental observations in animals support the role of these factors in normal T cell differentiation .
In humans , thymosin has been found to induce E rosette receptors in some of the bone marrow cells ( Horowitz & Goldstein , 1978 ) , and it has also been found to enhance the function of peripheral blood T cells ( Horowitz & Goldstein , 1978 ; Goldstein et al .
, 1981 ) .

However , lymphocytes of some species , such as man , are relatively resistant to the effects of glucocorticoids and may respond differently to thymosin ( Harris & Baxter , 1979 ) .
The purpose of the present study was to examine the in vitro effects of the physiological hormone thymosin fraction 5 ( TMS F5 ) and other T cell inducing agents on the glucocorticoid receptor status and steroid sensitivity of normal human thymocytes and of a human thymus derived leukaemia cell line ( MOLT 3 ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
Human thymocytes were obtained by teasing thymic specimens obtained from children ( age range from 3 months to 3 years old ) undergoing open cardiac surgery .
Cells were washed twice and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , L-glutamine and antibiotics .
Cell viability was checked by the trypan blue ( 0-2 % ) exclusion test and was always greater than 95 % .
Cell counts were performed by using an electronic cell counter ( Coulter S , Coulter Electronics , UK ) or manually with an improved Neubauer Chamber .
Human malignant lymphoid cell lines , MOLT 3 ( derived from a thymic acute lymphoblastic leukaemia case ) and RAJI ( from a B cell Burkitt 's lymphoma ) were kindly donated by Dr M.F .
Greaves , Department of Membrane Immunology , Imperial Cancer Research Fund .
Cells were maintained in logarithmic growth and suspended in fresh medium supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum prior to use .
TMS F5 was supplied by Dr W.E .
Scott ( Hoffman La Roche , New Jersey , USA ) .
Thymopoietin pentapeptide ( TP5 ) was purchased from Universal Biological Ltd. ( Cambridge , UK ) and interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) ( i.e .
T cell growth factor which induces proliferation of antigen pre-activated T cells ) was from Bethesda Research Laboratories Ltd. , UK .
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol L3-acetate ( TPA ) , bovine albumin and dexamethasone ( 9-x-fluoro-l6x-methyl prednisone ) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Ltd. , UK .
Culture medium RPMI 1640 , phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and culture supplements ( L-glutamine and antibiotics ) were obtained from GiBco Europe Ltd. , UK .
Hepes , tissue culture plates and flasks were purchased from Flow Laboratories , UK.. ( specific activity 40-47Ci/mmol ) and methyl-H-thy-midine ( specific activity 5 Ci/mmol ) were obtained from Amersham International , UK .
In vitro incubation experiments .
Human thymocytes ( 5-6 x 10°/ml ) in RPMI medium with 2 % FCS were incubated with or without TMS F5 or other substances for 18-20 h at 37°C in humidified air with 5 % CO ; .
The cells were washed and suspended in RPMI medium with Hepes ( 5mm ) since serum contains specific proteins , e.g .
corticosteroid binding globulin which may interfere with the glucocorticoid assays .
MOLT 3 cells were incubated under similar conditions at a cell concentration of 1-2 x 10®/ml in humidified air with 5 % , CO ; at 37°C .
After 4 days of incubation with TMS F5 or TPA , cells were washed and suspended in medium without serum as above , before testing for steroid receptors and sensitivity .
The incubation time was chosen because previous experiments demonstrated that changes in differentiation markers by thymosin and TPA were most marked by 4 days ( Ho et a/ .
, 1983a ) .
The cell viability of treated samples did not differ from that of the control cells .
Determination of glucocorticoid receptors in intact cells .
The assay was based on the method of Baxter er al .
( 1971 ) .
Samples at 4-6 x 10° cells/ml were tested in triplicate .
Aliquots of 1 ml were incubated with °H-dexamethasone at concentrations from 5 x 10®m to 1 x 10-°m for 45 min at 37°C in siliconized glass tubes ( 12 x 75 mm , Scientific Products , Illinois , USA ) .
Non-specific binding was measured from parallel triplicate sets by adding a 200-fold excess of unlabelled dexamethasone .
The reaction was stopped by the addition of cold PBS and washed twice at 20°C .
Samples were then suspended in 1 ml cold ethanol and transferred to a scintillation vial with 10 ml of scintillation fluid ( Packard Instrument Co. , USA ) .
Radioactivity was measured in a # counter ( LKB , 1210 Ultrobeta , UK ) .
Specific dexamethasone binding was taken as total binding minus non-specific binding .
The number of receptor sites were estimated by Scatchard analysis .
In some experiments , due to limited cell numbers , comparisons were made by determining receptor binding at a single concentration Thymosin effect on human thymocytes 275 ( near maximum ) of ' H-dexamethasone ( 2:5 x 10-®m ) .
Cell viability was always greater than 85 % throughout the experiment .
Assay for glucocorticoid sensitivity of thymosin treated and untreated cells .

viability to 33-8 +9-7 % and in ' H-thymidine uptake to 32-5 + 18:6 % , of control cells , i.e .
untreated with dexamethasone ( Table 3 ) .
However , thymocytes treated with TMS F5 were less sensitive than controls to the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone ( Table 3 ) .
Viability of thymocytes treated with TMS F5 at 150 and 300 ug/ml in the presence of dexamethasone were increased to 162:6+43-3 % , and 168:6+30-7 % of control values respectively .
On the other hand , IL-2 had no significant effect on the survival of thymocytes exposed to dexamethasone when compared to the control .
Thymic derived acute leukaemia cell line ( MOLT 3 ) Effect of TMS F5 on glucocorticoid receptors .
In three experiments , MOLT 3 cells were found to have 4,510 + 2,055 binding sites per cell and a Kd of 1:7+0-9 x 1078 m. After 4 days incubation , the specific dexamethasone binding activity ( 11-1 + 1-5 fmole/m1 ) of cells treated with TMS F5 ( 150 ug/ml ) was 442+153 % , of control ( P > 0-05 ) , whereas the specific dexamethasone binding 278 D. D. F. Ma , A. H. Ho & A. V. Hoffbrand ( 17-8 + 5-8 fmole/m !
1 ) of cells treated with TPA was 77-9 + 18-3 % , of control ( P not significant ) .
The control value was 23:9 +9-3 fmole/ml .
There was no difference in the steroid binding of MOLT 3 cells treated with or without TMS for 24 h. In the experiments with RAJI cells ( a B lymphoma line ) , 4 day incubation with TMS FS did not alter the number of steroid receptors .
Steroid receptors of TMS treated samples were 46-6 + 12-8 fmole/m1 , and of controls 49:0 +9-0 fmole/ml .
Effect of thymosin on glucocorticoid sensitivity .
MOLT 3 cells were found to be relatively resistant to the effect of dexamethasone .
At a dexamethasone concentration of 2:5 x 10-®m , the viability of TMS F5 treated and untreated samples , were similar ( ~91-:0+5:2 % , and 92-2 + 25 % , respectively , average of three experiments ) .
Thymosin did not influence the viability nor the thymidine uptake of RAJIT cells in the presence of similar concentrations of dexamethasone ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION The present results show that human thymocytes are sensitive to the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids .
The trypan blue dye exclusion and *H-thymidine incorporation tests were markedly reduced in the presence of 2:5 x 10-®m dexamethasone ( 33-8 +9-7 % and 32-5 + 18:6 % of control , respectively , Table 3 ) .
This is in contrast to the in vitro studies which showed that human thymocytes are highly resistant to cytolytic effects of steroids ( Claman , Moorhead & Benner , 1971 ; Galili , Prokocimer & Izak , 1980 ) .
Their samples were from an older age group .
Age related changes in the lymphoid cells of the thymuses have been reported ( Singh & Singh , 1979 ) .
The present results are in agreement with the study of infant thymocytes by Homo & Duval ( 1979 ) .
Further , in vivo administration of glucocorticoids caused profound acute reduction in the size of infant thymuses ( Caffey & Silbey , 1960 ) .
In the present study , the number of glucocorticoid receptors in human infant thymocytes was found to be 2,145 +725/cell with a Kd of 1-4+0-6 x 10-®m .
This is similar to that reported for humans ( Homo & Duval , 1979 ) and is half the number of binding sites/cell found in murine thymocytes ( Wira & Munck , 1974 ; Osheroff , 1981 ) .
The receptor binding of thymocytes reported here is slightly lower than that reported for normal adult peripheral T lymphocytes by Lippman & Barr ( 1977 ) .
Incubation with TMS F5 reduced the amount of glucocorticoid receptors in human thymocytes and increased their resistance to the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone ( Tables 2 & 3 ; Fig .
1 ) .
No such changes were detected when thymocytes were incubated with other inducing agents , e.g .
IL-2 , TP5 ( Table 2 ) .
TMS is produced in the thymus .
The blood level of a purified TMS peptide « ; in humans is found to be highest in infant and decreases with age ( Goldstein et a/ .
, 1981 ) .
TMS has been shown to possess a wide range of action on T cells .
Most reports are on pre- and post-thymic rather than intrathymic T cells ( reviewed by Bach et al .
, 1979 ; Goldstein et a/ .
, 1981 ) .
Recently , TMS peptides have been demonstrated to induce 5'-nucleotidase activity ( Cohen , Dosch & Gelfand , 1981 ) and changes in enzyme and surface antigenic markers of human thymocytes ( Ho et al .
, 1983b ) .
In the present study another physiological role of TMS in intrathymic T cell differentiation in man was demonstrated in vitro .
The changes in receptor binding and glucocorticoid sensitivity in TMS treated thymocytes might represent two or more independent events , e.g .
changes in cell viability or in cell cycle or differentiation changes .
The change in glucocorticoid receptors by TMS F5 is unlikely to be caused by changes in the cell viability or cell cycle since the thymidine uptake and trypan blue exclusion tests of the treated cells prior to the dexamethasone incubation were similar to that of the control .
The other possibility that TMS FS induced changes in the specific glucocorticoid binding and glucocorticoid resistance of different subsets of thymocytes is unlikely but can not definitely be excluded .
T cell leukaemias are thought to represent malignant clonal expansion of cells arrested at different stages of normal T cell development ( Greaves et al .
, 1981 ; Ma et al .
, 1983 ) .
It is thus of interest to investigate whether Thy-ALL cells behave similarly to their normal counterparts , the Thymosin effect on human thymocytes 279 !
arge cortical thymic blasts ( Bradstock et al .
, 1980 ; Ma et al .
, 1982 ) .
In this study , TMS F5 did induce similar glucocorticoid receptor changes in the Thy-ALL cell line ( MOLT 3 ) to those in normal thymocytes and had no effect on the glucocorticoid receptor activity of the B cell line ( Raji ) .
However , MOLT 3 cells were found to be more resistant to the cytolytic effect of dexamethasone ( 2:5 x 10-®m ) than normal thymocytes .
The lack of correlation between steroid receptor activity and response to glucocorticoid could be related to functionally abnormal steroid receptors in leukaemic cells as demonstrated by McCaffrey , Lillquist & Bell ( 1981 ) and may be relevant to developmept of resistance to steroid therapy in Thy-ALL cases .
TMS F5 has been shown to induce surface antigens and enzyme changes including TdT , ADA and SNT in T leukaemic cell lines ( Ho et al .
, ¥983a , 1983b ) .
Taken together with the findings reported here , it suggests that thymosin peptides induce Thy-ALL cells to differentiate .
Physiological differentiation inducing factors have been shown to cause differentiation in some myeloid leukaemic cells in vitro and in vivo ( Sachs , 1982 ; Metcalf , 1983 ) .
It would be of therapeutic interest if blast cells from patients with Thy-ALL ’ could ’ also be induced to differentiate by thymosin and related compounds .
