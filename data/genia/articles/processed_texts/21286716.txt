Cytokine Production by Vy *-T-Cell Subsets Is an Important Factor Determining CD4 *-Th-Cell Phenotype and Susceptibility of BALB/c Mice to Coxsackievirus B3-Induced Myocarditis SALLY A. HUBER , `` * DANIELLE GRAVELINE , ' WILLI K. BORN , `` anp REBECCA L. O'BRIEN Department of Pathology , University of Vermont , Burlington , Vermont , `` and Department of Immunology , National Jewish Medical and Research Center , Denver , Colorado® Received 24 January 2001/Accepted 3 April 2001 Two coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) variants ( H3 and H310A1 ) differ by a single amino acid mutation in the VP2 capsid protein .
H3 induces severe myocarditis in BALB/c mice , but H310A1 is amyocarditic .
Infection with H3 , but not H310A1 , preferentially activates Vy4 V64 cells , which are strongly positive for gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) , whereas Vy1 V684 cells are increased in both H3 and H310A1 virus-infected animals .
Depletion of Vy1* cells using monoclonal anti-Vy1 antibody enhanced myocarditis and CD4 *- , IFN-y *-cell responses in both H3- and H310A1-infected mice yet decreased the CD4 *- , IL-4*-cell response .
Depleting Vy4* cells suppressed myocarditis and reduced CD4* IFN-y* cells but increased CD4* IL-4* T cells .
The role of cytokine production by Vy1* and Vy4~* T cells was investigated by adoptively transferring these cells isolated from H3-infected BALB/c Stat4 knockout ( Stat4ko ) ( defective in IFN-y expression ) or BALB/c Statéko ( defective in IL-4 expression ) mice into H3 virus-infected wild-type BALB/c recipients .
Vy4 and Vy1* T cells from Stat4ko mice expressed IL-4 but no or minimal IFN-y , whereas these cell populations derived from Statéko mice expressed IFN-y but no IL-4 .
Stat4ko Vy1~* cells ( IL-4* ) suppress myocarditis .
Statéko Vy1* cells ( IFN-y * ) were not inhibitory .
Statéko Vy4~* cells ( IFN-y * ) significantly enhanced myocarditis .
Stat4ko Vy4* cells ( IL-4~* ) neither inhibited nor enhanced disease .
These results show that distinct y8-T-cell subsets control myocarditis susceptibility and bias the CD4*-Th-cell response .
The cytokines produced by the Vy subpopu- lation have a significant influence on the CD4 *-Th-cell phenotype .
T cells expressing the y8 T-cell receptor ( TcR ) accumulate at inflammatory sites and can modulate disease susceptibility by either promoting or suppressing inflammation ( 4 , 6 , 9 , 13 , 17 , 20 , 27 , 28 , 35 , 36 , 38 , 41 , 44 ) .
In some models , y8 * T cells have both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects at different times in the disease process .
In the models of arthritis and spontaneous abortion , the y8 * T cells that were present early in the disease in both models were proinflammatory and led to abortion while those that were present later were anti-inflammatory and inhibited abortion ( 5 , 36 ) .
The biological effect of y8 ¢ T cells may be mediated by the cytokines they produce .
y8¢ T cells can produce cytokines of either a Th1 ( gamma interferon [ IFN-y ] ) or Th2 ( interleukin 4 [ IL-4 ] ) phenotype , and which phenotype occurs can be dependent upon the type of antigen used for their activation or the subtype of y8 `` T cells stimu-lated .
y8 * T cells in arthritis ( 4 ) and in murine cytomegalovirus and Nippostrongylus brasiliosis infection ( 7 ) predominantly make IL-4 and induce Th2 differentiation in CD4 * -T-cell populations .
In contrast , in Listeria monocytogenes , Salmonella choleraesuis , and murine cytomegalovirus infections , y8 `` T cells produce IFN-y and promote CD4 *-Th1-cell responses ( 7 , 30 , 33 ) .
Studies by Azuara and Pereira ( 1 ) and Gerber and colleagues ( 10 ) indicate that in DBA/2 mice y8* T lymphocytes which express the Vy1 V86.4 TeR predominantly express IL-4 .
Thus , the type of y8 `` cell subset activated during an * Corresponding author .

5860 immune response may be crucial to its modulatory effect on CD4 *-T-cell responses .
Previous studies from this laboratory demonstrated that y8 * T cells control susceptibility of mice to coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) -induced myocarditis ( 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 ) .
Most recently , we demonstrated that Vy1 * T cells cause myocarditis resistance in CVB3-infected C57BL/6 mice but that Vy4* T cells activated in Bl.Tg.Ea animals , i.e .
, C57BL/6 mice transgenically made to express major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II IE , cause myocarditis susceptibility ( 14 ) .
The major problem with this earlier study was that Vy4~* cells are more prevalent in uninfected Bl.Tg.Ea animals whereas Vy1 * cells predominate in C57BL/6 mice .
Thus , it was possible that CVB3 infection was simply activating the dominant y8 *-T-cell population in the two strains rather than selectively activating either population specifically .
In the present study , we begin with the same mouse strain , BALB/c , and show that pathogenic ( H3 ) and nonpathogenic ( H310A1 ) virus infections selectively activate different Vy * cell subsets and that , again , Vy1 * T cells cause disease resistance but Vy4~* cells cause susceptibility .
The cytokine profiles of the Vy cell subsets suggest that these cells modulate CD4 * -Th-cell responses through the cytokines they release .
We tested this hypothesis by transferring Vy subpopulations isolated from BALB/c Stat6 knockout ( Statéko ) and Stat4ko mice into H3 virus-infected recipients .
Statd4 and Stato are transcription factors important in IL-12 and IL-4 , respectively ( 3 , 21 , 29 ) , and animals lacking Stat4 and Stat6 have defective Th1- and Th2-cell responses .
Vy1* cells isolated from BALB/c Stat4ko mice , which stain positively for IL-4 , still suppressed CD4 *-Thl1-cell responses and myocarditis ; the Vor .
75 , 2001 same cell population derived from Statéko donors was not suppressive .
This result implies that the cytokines made by the Vy * cell subpopulations are important in modulating myocarditis susceptibility .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice .
Male BALB/cJ , BALB/c-Stat4 `` `` ~ , and BALB/c-Stat6 `` `` ** `` mice , 5 to 6 weeks of age , were purchased from Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , Maine .
Virus , virus infection , and virus titration .
Animals were infected by intraperi-toneal ( ip . )
injection of 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 10+ PFU of cither the CVB3 H3 or the H310A1 variant , derived from Cos cells transfected with the infectious cDNAs of this virus ( 22 ) .
For virus titration , hearts were homogenized in 0.9 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 100 U of penicillin per ml , 100 ug of streptomycin per ml , and 5 % fetal bovine serum .
Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,045 x g for 10 min .
The titer of the supernatant was determined by the plaque-forming assay on HeLa cell mono-layers as described previously ( 16 ) .
Antibodies .
Antibody class control ( isotype control ) and antigen-specific antibodies were obtained from PharMingen ( San Diego , Calif. ) .
These included phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated anti-CD3 ( clone 1742 ) ; purified anti-TcRB ( clone H57-597 ) ; purified anti-Mac3 ( clone M3/84 ) ; purified anti-IA `` ( clone 39-10-8 ) ; purified rat anti-mouse CD16 CD32 ( Fe Block , clone 2.4G2 ) ; biotinylated or CyChrome- , fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - , or PE-conjugated rat IgG1 ( clone R3-34 ) ; biotinylated or FITC- or PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse IFN-y ( clone XMG 1.2 ) ; biotinylated or FITC- or PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse IL-4 ( clone BVD4-1D11 ) ; FITC-conjugated hamster anti-mouse CD69 ( clone H1.2F3 ) ; biotinylated or FITC- , PE- , or CyChrome-conjugated rat-anti-mouse CD4 ( clone GK 1.5 ) ; purified or FITC- or PE-conjugated hamster IgG ; FITC- or PE-conjugated mouse anti-hamster IgG cocktail ( clones G70-204 and G94-56 ) ; and purified or FITC- or PE-conjugated hamster-anti-y8 TeR ( clone GL3 ) .

CyChrome- , FITC- , and PE-conjugated streptavidin was purchased from PharMingen .
Streptavidin-conjugated Red613 was purchased from Gibco Life Technologies , Grand Island , N.Y .
Isolation of spleen lymphocytes .
Spleens were aseptically removed from eu-thanized mice , pressed through fine-mesh screens to form single-cell suspensions which were layered over Histopaque-1077 ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , Mo . )
, and centrifuged at 1,048 x g for 15 min .
The lymphoid cells at the interface were retrieved and counted by trypan blue exclusion .
The procedure for isolation of enriched populations of Vy1 `` * or Vy4 * cell populations has been published ( 14 ) .
Briefly , splenocytes obtained after Histopaque purification were incubated on nylon wool for 30 min at 37°C ; the nonadherent cells were retrieved ; incubated with 1:50 dilutions of Fe Block , TcR antibody , anti-IA® antibody , anti-Mac3 antibody , and either anti-Vy1 or anti-Vy4 antibody for 20 min on ice ; washed twice ; and incubated with a 1:50 dilution of mouse anti-hamster IgG for 20 min on ice .
The cells were again washed and incubated with magnetic particles conjugated with anti-mouse IgG and anti-rat IgG ( PerSeptive Biosystems , Fra-mingham , Mass . )
for 30 min at 4°C .
Bound cells were removed by passing the cell suspension over a magnet .
The remaining cells were washed twice , divided into two tubes , incubated in 100 wl of PBS-1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) containing a 1:50 dilution of either anti-Vy1 or anti-Vy4 antibody for 20 min on ice , washed , and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Life Technologies ) with 100 U of penicillin per ml , 100 jg of streptomycin per ml , and 80 pg of recombinant IL-2 ( PharMingen ) per ml .
Cells ( 5 x 10° ) were added to tissue culture plates coated with mouse anti-hamster IgG , centrifuged at 100 x g for 5 min , and incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5 % CO ; incubator for 3 days .
The cells were retrieved , centrifuged on Histopaque to remove dead cells , and counted by trypan blue exclusion , and an aliquot was surface stained with anti-CD3 and either anti-Vy1 or anti-Vy4 antibodies to determine purity .
Figure 1 shows a representative flow diagram of Vy1* enriched cells obtained by this protocol .
Purity of populations ranged from 65 to 78 % Vy1 CD3 * or Vy4 CD3* cells for all populations .
Adoptive transfer of Vy cells .
Vy1 `` * or Vy4~* cells were washed three times in PBS , resuspended to 5 x 10° cells in 0.2 ml of PBS , and injected intravenously ( i.v . )
through the tail vein of H3 virus-infected BALB/c recipient mice on the third day after infection .
Animals were killed on day 7 after infection .
Control mice received PBS alone .

Numbers in the upper right-hand corner indicate the percentages of cells in the quadrants .
Flow cytometry .
Cells were cither stained directly for cell surface markers or cultured in medium containing 10 ug of brefeldin A per ml , 50 ng of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) per ml , and 500 ng of ionomycin ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) per ml for 4 h at 37°C in 5 % CO ; for intracellular cytokine analysis .
For surface staining , cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1 % BSA ( Sigma ) , a 1:100 dilution of Fe Block , and 1:100 dilutions of either fluorochrome-conjugated or biotinylated antibodies .
The cells were incubated on ice for 20 min , washed , and , where applicable ( when biotinylated antibodies were used ) , resuspended in PBS-BSA containing a 1:50 dilution of streptavidin-fluorochrome for 20 min on ice .
The cells were washed twice and resuspended in 2 % paraformaldehyde .
For intracellular staining , cells were washed once after the 4-h culture described above in PBS-BSA containing 10 pg of brefeldin A per ml and surface stained as described above .
The amount of brefeldin A was maintained throughout the labeling procedure .
After surface staining , the cells were washed and fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min ; thereafter , brefeldin A was not required .
The cells were then washed once in PBS-BSA buffer , incubated for 10 min in PBS-BSA buffer containing 0.5 % saponin , and stained for intracellular molecules and cytokines , as indicated in Results , by resuspending the cells in PBS-BSA-saponin containing 1:100 dilutions of Fe Block and the biotinylated or fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and 50 pg of rat polyclonal IgG ( Zymed , San Francisco , Calif. ) per ml .
After incubation for 30 min , the cells were washed twice in PBS-BSA-saponin and once in saponin-free PBS-BSA to close the membrane and then resuspended in PBS containing 2 % paraformaldehyde .
Positive controls for cytokine staining were 2.5 X 10° cells of either MIC-1 ( IFN-y ) - or MIC-2 ( IL-4 ) -fixed cells obtained from PharMingen .
Negative controls were biotinylated , and fluorochrome-conjugated species- and isotype-matched Igs and streptavidin-fluorochrome combinations were as used in specific-antibody staining samples .
Stained cell populations were analyzed using a Coulter Epics Elite instrument with a single excitation wavelength ( 488 nm ) and band filters for PE ( wavelength , 575 nm ) , FITC ( 525 nm ) , Red613 ( 613 nm ) , and CyChrome ( 670 nm ) .
Each sample population was classified for cell size ( forward scatter ) and complexity ( side scatter ) and then gated on a population of interest .
At least 10,000 cells were evaluated for each sample .
Criteria for positive staining were established using isotype controls .
The results were expressed in one of two ways : cither as the percentage of total splenocytes staining for a particular marker minus the number of splenocytes in the isotype control or as the percentage of a specific population of cells which stained positively for each marker [ for example , the percentage of CD4* cells staining for IL-4 represents CD4* IL-4 * cells/ ( CD4* IL-4~ + CD4* IL-4* cells ) x 100 ] .

RESULTS Evaluation of subpopulations of y8¢* T cells in mice with myocarditis .
Table 1 shows that BALB/c mice infected with H3 virus develop severe myocardial inflammation ( 7.9 % of the myocardium inflamed ) but that mice given H310A1 virus have little myocarditis ( 1.3 % of the myocardium inflamed ) .
Cardiac virus titers were increased in animals infected with H310A¥1 virus , compared to those in H3 virus-infected mice , even though H310A1-infected animals had minimal myocarditis .
Numbers of CD4 * IFN-y * cells in the spleen were increased in H3 virus-infected mice compared to numbers in H310A¥1 virus-infected mice , while numbers of CD4 * IL-4* cells were re-duced .
Figure 2 shows representative intracellular cytokine ( IFN-y and IL-4 ) staining patterns in these animals after gating on the CD4 * -cell population .
H310A¥1 virus infection did not increase the number of Th1 cells relative to those found in uninfected mice but did increase the number of CD4* IL-4~* cells in the spleen ( from 2.4 % of cells in normal to 8.5 % of cells in H310A1 virus-infected animals ) .
We next examined the relative proportions of Vy1 and Vy4 subpopulations in H3 and H310A¥1 virus-infected BALB/c mice ( Table 2 ) .
H3 virus infection resulted in an approximately threefold increase in the percentage of splenic y8¢ T cells , whereas the percentage of these cells in H310A1 virus-infected mice stayed approximately the same as in uninfected BALB/c animals .
At the same time , numbers of Vy 4 * cells were preferentially increased in H3 virus-infected mice ( by sevenfold ) but remained unaltered in H310A¥1-infected mice compared to numbers in uninfected animals .
Approximately 40 % of the Vy4 * -cell population in H3 virus-infected animals was activated as assessed by CD69 expression .
Both H3 and H310A¥1 virus-infected animals showed increases in percentages of Vy1* cells .
Interestingly , in both H3 and H310A¥1 virus-infected groups , V84 expression dominated .
Intracellular cytokine staining of the Vy-stained cell populations ( Fig .
3 ) revealed that , although neither Vy1* nor cells from uninfected mice showed much intracellular cytokine staining , cells from H3-infected mice showed substantially increased cytokine expression .

To determine whether the cytokine made by the y8 *-T-cell subset is primarily responsible for its effect on CD4 * -cell responses and myocarditis susceptibility , BALB/c Stat4ko and BALB/c Stat6 mice were infected with H3 virus and , 5 days later , enriched populations of Vy1 ~* and Vy4* cells were isolated as described in Materials and Methods .
Figure 7 shows IFN-y and IL-4 expression in the subpopulation by intracellular cytokine staining .
As expected , both Vy1 * and Vy4 * cells from Statéko mice showed predominant IFN-y but minimal IL-4 expression .
Vy4 * cells consistently stained more strongly for IFN-y than did Vy1~* cells from these animals .
Similarly , while both Vy1 * and Vy4 * cells from Stat4ko mice stained positively for IL-4 , Vy4 * cells from Statdko mice also showed some residual IFN-y expression , compared to results with the Vy1* subpopulation .
Wild-type BALB/c mice were infected with H3 virus and 3 days later received 5 X 10° cells from the Vy subsets i.v .

Flow analysis of intracellular cytokine staining of enriched Vy1* and Vy4 * cells from BALB/c Statéko and BALB/c Statd4ko mice .
Mice were infected with H3 virus and killed 5 days later .

Aliquots of the cell populations were stimulated with PMA , ionomycin , and brefeldin A ; surface stained for the FITC-conjugated y8 TeR ; and intracellularly stained with PE-conjugated anti-IL-4 and biotinylated anti-IFN-y and then with Red 613 streptavidin .
though these cells express IL-4 .
Similarly , Vy1* cells from Statéko ( IL-4 deficient ) mice had no significant effect on either myocarditis or CD4 * -cell responses , yet Vy4 * cells from these donors substantially enhanced both disease and Th1 cell bias .
DISCUSSION We had previously found that H3 virus infection of C57BL/6 mice activates Vy1 * cells , which suppress myocarditis , but that infection of Bl.Tg.Ea mice activates * cells , which promote myocarditis ( 14 ) .
Since Vy4 * cells are 4- to 10-fold more abundant in Bl.Tg.Ea « than in C57BL/6 animals , possibly because the expression of MHC class II IE antigen in Bl.Tg.Ea mice influences y8 * cell subset generation during T-cell on-togeny , activation of distinct Vy * cell subsets in the C57BL/6 and Bl.Tg.Ea animals might simply reflect virus activation of whatever y8 * cells are present .
In contrast , the results presented in this paper clearly demonstrate that myocarditic and Vor .

* , value significantly different than that for H3-infected BALB/c mice not given V > cells .
nonmyocarditic CVB3s selectively activate different y8 `` subsets associated with modulating the CD4 *-Th-cell phenotype .
The Thli-cell-Th2-cell dichotomy in disease susceptibility and resistance is well recognized ( 8 , 11 , 19 , 24 , 32 , 37 ) .
In those diseases which are dependent on proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha , Thl-cell responses are often pathogenic while Th2-cell responses are protective .
In contrast , in diseases requiring T-cell-dependent B-cell responses , such as IgE-dependent allergies , Th2 cells correlate with disease whereas Th1 cells can be protective .
In CVB3-induced myocarditis , tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-18 are crucial to myocarditis susceptibility ( 25 ) but T-cell-dependent responses are not required for virus clearance ( 43 ) .
Thus , Th1-cell responses are predicted to be pathogenic in this disease .
y8 * cells clearly can modulate Th1 and Th2 responses either directly or indirectly , as has been shown by various published reports .
The assumed mechanism for this modulation is through cytokine production by the y8 * cells , which provide the appropriate environment to influence CD4 * -cell differentiation ( 7 , 8 , 26 , 44 ) .
In this case , y8 * cells should be quickly activated in peripheral lymphoid tissues and rapidly accumulate at local inflammatory sites in order to maximally influence the developing antigen-specific immune response .
y8 ~ T cells are excellent candidates for the early cytokine response because these cells can respond to broadly distributed antigens in damaged tissues and microbes , such as heat shock proteins ( 2 ) , and do not require classical antigen processing and MHC-restricted presentation .
Moreover , y8 * T cells have a memory phenotype in the periphery , suggestive of prior antigen activation , and the potential for rapid expansion ( 40 , 42 ) .
In the present communication , we demonstrate that few y8* T cells from uninfected mice express cytokines by intracellular cytokine staining but that many y8 * T cells from H3-infected animals express high levels of IFN-y .
In these animals , the stronger IFN-y expression in Vy4~* cells than that in Vy1~* cells conforms to a predicted superiority of the Vy4* population in Th1-cell modulation .
Thus , based on the cytokine pat-terns , depletion of Vy4~* cells in H3-infected animals is expected to reduce Th1-cell responses , as was seen in this study .
There are certain discrepancies in the data , however .
Anti-Vy1 y8* T CELLS IN MYOCARDITIS - 5867 antibody treatment of H3 virus-infected mice results in an increase in CD4 * IL-4~* cells from 0.2 to 1.5 % ( Table 3 ) .
If Vy1 * cells uniformly promote CD4 *-Th2-cell responses , this result is perplexing .
We do not have an explanation for this finding , but as discussed below , antibody treatment might stimulate as well as eliminate specific cell populations .
Activating Vy1* cells prior to their elimination might simultaneously cause increases in CD4* Th1 cells ( through elimination of Vy1 * cells ) and increases in CD4* Th2+* cells ( through activation of Vy1 * cells prior to their elimination and the release of Th2-promoting factors ) .
The results are also unclear for H310A1-infected mice .
Here , anti- Vy1 antibody treatment enhanced myocarditis but the IFN-y staining of the Vy4 * cells in these animals was modest .
Thus , it is not clear why depletion of the Vy1* cells promoted CD4 *-Th1-cell responses based solely on the cytokine data .
One possibility is that other cytokines differ in their levels of Vy1* and Vy4 * cells , which may be potential regulators of the CD4 * response , either through direct action on the CD4 *-cell population or by influencing other cell types , such as macrophages , which subsequently alter Th-cell development ( 23 ) .
y8 * T cells have been reported to make IL-13 , a cytokine known to promote Th2-dependent responses such as IgE production ( 12 , 30 ) .
This would enable Vy1 * T cells to promote Th2-cell responses even if they make little if any IL-4 .
Experiments using antibody-induced depletion of y8 * cells in vivo have potential problems , even though it has been used by various investigators for Vy-subset depletion ( 31 , 34 ) .
Antibody binding to the TcR might activate cells to release cytokines and immunomodulate « B *-T-cell responses , prior to their elimination .
Thus , the antibody depletion experiments might indicate that either the lack of or the activation of specific subpopulations resulted in the observed effects .
Studies by R. O'Brien and her colleagues indicate that treatment of mice with the monoclonal antibodies causes depletion of cells within 24 h and remains effective for 2 weeks .
Since the monoclonal antibodies in this study were given 3 days prior to infection , presumably any cytokines released due to antibody-mediated TeR cross-linking should have been cleared by the time of infection .
Another potential problem is that the antibodies did not totally eliminate the relevant cell populations , and although it is quite clear that most Vy1 * or Vy4 ~* cells had been eliminated , some dull-staining cells remained .
Whether these cells can affect CD4 * -cell responses is not known .
It is also not clear whether the residual IFN-y* cells in anti-Vy4 antibody-treated mice reflect cells resistant to y8 * -T-cell influence or whether complete elimination of the Vy4~* cells would have more effectively reduced the number of IFN-y-producing cells .
Adoptive-transfer experiments using enriched populations of Vy1* and Vy4* cells were done to complement the antibody depletion experiments .
In this case , we know that the y8 * subpopulations are strongly activated prior to injection into recipient mice , and effects observed in the recipient should reflect the direct or indirect consequences of these specific Vy subpopulations .
To clarify whether cytokines made by y8 * cells exclusively control myocarditis susceptibility , we isolated Vy1 * and Vy4~* cells from BALB/c transgenic mice lacking either the Stat4 or Stat6 transcription factor required for expression of IL-12 or IL-4 , respectively ( 3 , 29 ) .
Stat4ko mice are strongly 5868 HUBER ET AL .
biased toward a Th2-cell phenotype because of the lack of IL-12 needed to stimulate IFN-y responses .
Both Vy1* and Vy4* cells from Stat4ko mice showed substantial IL-4 expression by intracellular cytokine staining , yet only the Vy1* subpopulation suppressed myocarditis .
The lack of suppression by the Vy4* cells might result from residual IFN-y expression in this population .
A study by Cai et al .
( 3 ) also found residual IFN-y expression in Toxoplasma gondii-infected animals , indicating an IL-12-independent pathway for IFN-y expression .
The modest IFN-y expression in Vy4 * cells from Stat4ko mice might be sufficient to negate any suppressive activity of IL-4 on CD4 *-cell responses .
However , this study might also indicate that the cytokines made by the Vy subpopulations only partially explain their effects on CD4 * responses .
Vy1 * cells from Statéko mice express IFN-y but negligible IL-4 .
These cells lose their ability to suppress myocarditis but fail to aggravate the disease , as is seen with Vy4 * cells from Statéko animals .
Again , the intensity of the IFN-y responses is greater in the Vy4* than in the Vy1~* cell population .
The relative concentrations of IFN-y and IL-4 may be the determining factor in the intensity of the Th1- or Th2-cell response .
As shown in Fig .
6 , CD4 * cells are not the only splenocytes making IFN-y or IL-4 .
One or more populations of non-CD4 * cells also stain intracellularly for these cytokines .
To date , the presence of the non-CD4 * cytokine-positive cell population ( s ) correlates with the CD4 * -cell response .
That is , treatment of H3-infected mice with anti- Vy4 antibody reduces not only the percentage of CD4* IFN-y * cells but also that of these non-CD4* IFN-y* cells as well .
Many of these cells can be accounted for by Vy4 * cells themselves .
CD8 * T cells can not be shown to stain for cytokines .
The remaining cells besides CD4* and y8 * cells might be natural killer ( NK ) cells which are often cytokine positive ( 39 ) .
If NK cells are present in the cytokine-positive population , then y8 * cells might be able to affect cytokine responses in this population as well .
