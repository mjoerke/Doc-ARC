Mikela Cyclosporin A and FK506 are immunosuppressive compounds that have similar inhibitory effects on the expression of several lymphokines produced by T lymphocytes .
Despite their similar effects the drugs bind to two different cytosolic proteins , cyclophilin and FKBP respectively , which raises the possibility that they have different modes of action .
Using constructs in which mRNA production controlled by a specific transcription factor could be readily measured we found that both cyclosporin A and FK506 completely inhibited transcription activated by NF-AT , NFIL2 A , NFIL2 B and partially inhibited transcription activated by NFxB .
Cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibited only transcriptional activation that was dependent on Ca** mobilization .
However , cyclosporin A and FK506 did not inhibit Ca** mobilization dependent expression of c-fos mRNA indicating that only a subset of signalling pathways regulated by is sensitive to these drugs .
Furthermore , we did not observe any qualitative differences between the effect of cyclosporin A and FK506 on six different transcription factors which suggests that these drugs may interfere with the activity of a novel Ca** dependent step that regulates several transcription factors .
Key words : cyclosporin A/FK506/T lymphocyte activa-tion/transcription Introduction Activation of T lymphocytes is a complex process requiring recognition of antigen by the T cell antigen receptor as well as concomitant signals from antigen presenting cells in the form of the cytokines interleukin 1 or interleukin 6 .
These events lead to the activation of second messenger pathways such as tyrosme kinases and protem kinase C and to an increase in intracellular Ca** ( Weiss er al .
, 1984 ; Wiskocil et al .
, 1985 ; Mustelin et al .
, 1990 ) .
These events on the cell membrane initiate a sequential activation of a group of genes that in turn give rise to proliferation and immunologic function ( see Crabtree , 1989 for review ) .
Cyclosporin A , a cyclic undecapeptide , inhibits T cell activation at an early step and thereby interferes with numerous immunoregulatory functions carried out by activated T cells through © Oxford University Press lymphokines such as interleukins 2 , 3 and 4 , y interferon , GM-GSF and TNF a ( Elliot et al .
, 1984 ; Bickel et al .
, 1987 ; Arai et al .
, 1989 ; Tocci et al .
, 1989 ) .
Treatment with cyclosporin A does not prevent the increase in intracellular Ca `` * and kinase activation , however , the transcriptional activation of certain genes is inhibited .
Recently we found that cyclosporin A , at concentrations with no detectable toxic effect on cells , inhibits the activation of specific transcription factors that regulate genes such as interleukin 2 which are expressed early in T lymphocyte activation ( Emmel et al .
, 1989 ) .
These findings placed the action of cyclosporin A at or proximal to the transcription factors involved in gene activation but distal to the known cytoplasmic events in the pathway .
Cyclosporin A binds and inhibits the activity of cyclophilin ( Haendler eral .
, 1987 ) , a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase ( Fisher et al .
, 1989 ; Takahashi et al .
, 1989 ) that may play a role in the folding of proteins in vivo ( Lang et al .
, 1987 ; Lin et al .
, 1988 ) .
In Drosophila melanogaster a gene homologous to cyclophilin , ninaA4 , affects the expression of rhodopsin by a post-translational mechanism which may occur via a putative isomerase activity of ninad4 protein on the folding of rhodopsin ( Schneuwly et al .
, 1989 ; Shieh et al .
, 1989 ) .
However , cyclosporin A may mediate its effect by a mechanism that is not directly linked to the inhibition of the isomerase activity of cyclophilin .
In Newrospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae a protein homologous to cyclophilin mediates the toxic effects of cyclosporin A apparently by forming a toxic complex with cyclosporin A .
This is supported by the finding that in N.crassa heterokaryons having one mutant allele of cyclophilin and one normal allele die in the presence of cyclosporin A ( Tropschug et al .
, 1989 ) .
Furthermore , all the cyclosporin A resistant mutants either lack cyclophilin or have a mutation that prevents binding .
Similar inhibitory complexes of cyclophilin and cyclosporin A may mediate the effect of cyclosporin A in the activation of T lymphocytes .
Recently another potent immunosuppressant was discovered , FK506 , that has biologic effects very similar to cyclosporin A but is a macrolide with a different chemical structure than cyclosporin A ( Sawada et al .
, 1987 ) .
Remarkably , FK506 also binds to a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase , FKBP , and inhibits its activity ( Harding et al .
, 1989 ; Siekierka et al .
, 1989 ) , however , FKBP has no sequence similarity to cyclophilin ( Maki et al .
, 1990 ; Standaert er al .
, 1990 ) .
This raises the possibility of dissecting the signalling pathways leading to activation of individual transcription factors by virtue of sensitivity to cyclosporin A or FK506 .
We found that the effects of the two drugs were similar on each of the four transcription factors that were inhibited and on each of the two transcription factors that were not inhibited .
Furthermore , the distinguishing feature of the transcrlptlon factors affected by cyclosporin A and FK506 is that they require Ca'* mobilization for their activation .
These results suggest that 4425 P.Mattila et al .

( a ) The map of the 5 ' region of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene and the structure of the NFAT construct .
Sites which bind proteins believed to contribute to transcriptional control of interleukin 2 are noted with the names of the putative binding proteins ( Durand et al .
, 1988 ) .
The NFAT -lacZ construct contains the E.coli lacZ B-galactosidase gene attached to position +47 of the interleukin 2 which precedes the translational start site for interleukin 2 .
A trimer of the NF-AT binding site ( -286 to -257 of interleukin 2 ) is ligated to a minimal interleukin 2 promoter at -72 .
All three NF-AT sites are oriented 5'-3 ' .
The location of the RNA probe ( 370 bp ) relative to the NFAT -lacZ construct is presented as a black line and the lower lines present fragments of the RNA probe protected by lacZ RNA ( 250 bp ) and interleukin 2 RNA ( 47 bp ) .
Lower case letters indicate NF-AT contact sites determined by a methylation interference assay ( Durand et al .
, 1988 ) .
( b ) FK506 and cyclosporin A inhibit the transcriptional activity of NF-AT and transcription of interleukin 2 .
Jurkat cells stably transfected with the NFAT construct were stimulated for 5 h with ionomycin ( 2 M ) and phorbol myristate acetate ( 32 nM ) in the presence of the indicated concentrations of FK506 or cyclosporin A ( nM ) .
Transcription of lacZ mRNA from the NFAT -lacZ construct was measured by a ribonuclease protection assay using the RNA probe described in ( a ) .
Interleukin 2 mRNA can be measured on the same lane of the gel since the ribonuclease protection probe contains 47 bp from the 5 ' untranslated region of interleukin 2 .
B-galactosidase activity is presented as percent of maximal activity and it correlates with the intensities of the protected bands representing lacZ mRNA .

cyclophilin and FKBP affect a common signal transduction pathway that requires an increase in intracellular Ca** for the activation of several transcription factors involved in gene regulation during T lymphocyte activation .
Results Cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibit the activity of several transcription factors Changes in gene expression which mediate T cell activation are related to induction of several transcription factors such as c-fos ( Reed et al .
, 1986 ) and NFxB ( Leung and Nabel , 1988 ) .
Activation of the interleukin 2 gene which is a growth factor for T lymphocytes requires the activity of several transcription factors as illustrated in Figure la ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ; Serfling et al .
, 1989 ) .
To study the influence of cyclosporin A and FK506 on the activity of individual transcription factors induced during T lymphocyte activation the human leukemic cell line Jurkat was stably transfected with plasmids that have multiple copies of specific binding sites for transcription factors controlling the expression of Escherichia coli lacZ B-galactosidase gene .
We chose to analyze the transcription factor binding sites NFIL2A , NFIL2B and NF-AT from the interleukin 2 gene .
Although interleukin 2 gene has been reported to contain NFxB and AP-1 binding sites these binding sites may also be occupied by other transcription factors and therefore we chose to analyze the NFxB binding site from the immunoglobulin x 4426 light chain and the AP-1 binding site from the metallothionein gene which are more thoroughly characterized .
The interleukin 2 minimal promoter was used in most of the constructs since it has very low activity by itself but still gives high expression when linked to enhancer elements ( Verweij et al .
, 1990 ) .
The AP-1 construct was ligated to SV40 minimal promoter which contains six SP-1 sites and it therefore presents transcription controlled by both AP-1 and SP-1 binding factors .
The NFIL2A construct contained the TATA box from the y fibrinogen promoter but very similar results can be obtained with a construct that has NFIL2ZA binding sites linked to interleukin 2 minimal promoter ( unpublished observations ) .
Three copies of each binding site linked to a promoter construct were used except in the case of NFIL2ZA and NFIL2B constructs where four copies were used because they gave a higher level of expression .
The transfected plasmids contain a hygromycin resistance gene and stable transfectants were selected in the presence of hygromycin .
Hygromycin resistant clones that had little or no constitutive expression but expressed high levels of -galactosidase upon stimulation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore were selected and cloned with the fluorescence activated cell sorter ( FACS ) using the fluorogenic substrate for B-galactosidase , fluorescein-digalactoside ( Nolan ert al .
, 1988 ) .
NF-AT directed transcription was assayed in a clone of Jurkat cells having one copy of a construct with three NFAT binding sites controlling the expression of the lacZ gene ( Figure la ) .
lacZ RNA in this cell line was detected only after stimulation ( Figure 1b ) .
This inducible expression of lacZ mRNA was inhibited in a dose dependent manner by both cyclosporin A and FK 506 .
The size of the RNA probe fragment protected by lacZ mRNA in the ribonuclease protection assay indicated that the NF-AT binding sites ligated to promoter sequences from interleukin 2 ( -72 to +47 ) directed correctly initiated transcripts at the interleukin 2 gene initiation site ( Figure la ) .
Interleukin 2 mRNA can be measured in the same lane of the gel since the ribonuclease protection probe contains 47 bp from the 5 ' untranslated region of interleukin 2 ( Figure la and b ) .
Furthermore , since the ribonuclease probe used to measure interleukin 2 and lacZ transcripts is identical , direct comparisons can be made between the activity of the transfected gene and the activity of the endogenous interleukin 2 gene .
The intensities of the bands representing lacZ mRNA correlate well with the measured 3-galactosidase enzymatic activities ( Figure 1b ) .
Similar results were obtained when the transcriptional activity of the entire interleukin 2 enhancer was investigated by analysis of induced B-galactosidase activity encoded by lacZ ( Figure 2 ) .
Both cyclosporin A and FK506 also inhibited in a dose dependent manner the ability of the NFILZA , NFIL2B and NFxB binding sites to active transcription ( Figure 2 ) .
The transcription from a construct in which sites for both AP-1 and SP-1 are controlling transcription of lacZ was not significantly affected by cyclosporin A or FK506 .
A 50 % inhibition of transcription from constructs sensitive to these drugs was achieved with ~ 10 nM cyclosporin A and 0.1 nM FK506 ( Figure 2 ) .
These dose-response relationships are consistent with previous reports that FK506 is 100-fold more effective than cyclosporin A and are similar to the concentrations required to block T cell activation ( Sawada et al .
, 1987 ) .
FK506 inhibits the DNA binding activity of NF-AT Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to examine the effect of cyclosporin A and FK506 on the binding activity of NF-AT , NFIL2B and AP-1 transcription factors ( Figure 3 ) .
NF-AT binding activity was inhibited by cyclosporin A as demonstrated previously by Emmel et al .
( 1989 ) and it was also inhibited by FK506 ( Figure 3a ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the NFIL2B binding site gave rise to an inducible retarded band that was not inhibited by cyclosporin A or FK506 although the transcriptional activity was inhibited ( Figure 3b ) .
The DNA binding activity of AP-1 was not inhibited by FK506 ( Figure 3¢ ) .
Only Ca `` * regulated activities are inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506 T lymphocytes require the concordant actions of two signals derived from the antigen receptor and interleukin 1 or interleukin 6 for activation .
These pathways can to some extent be mimicked by stimulation with a combination of calcium ionophore and phorbol ester .
Transcription of lacZ mRNA directed by three copies of the NFxB site ( Figure 4a ) was stimulated with phorbol ester alone and this phorbol ester induced activity was completely resistant to FK506 ( Figure 4b ) .
However , when cells were stimulated with phorbol ester together with ionomycin the transcriptional activity of NFxB was further enhanced 4-fold .
The increased level of NFxB mediated transcription induced by calcium ionophore was almost completely inhibited by FK506 Signal transduction in T lymphocyte activation IL2 NF-AT p 100 ( 326,447 ) | 3 O g 50 | FK506 CsA | FK506 CsA po GC a 0 y NFIL2 A NFIL2 B § 100 rj & 8 5so| FKso6 CsA { FK506 CsA 3 » | 8 o E NF kappa B| CsA AP-1+SP1 © 100| L- M é FK 506 CsA FK506 i 50 A .

, 1987 ) .
B-galactosidase activities are presented as percent of the maximal activity of each cell line .
( Figure 4b ) .
These effects on the transcriptional activity directed by the NFxB site were paralleled by similar changes in DNA binding activity ( Figure 4c ) .
The effect of cyclosporin A on the transcriptional activity of NFxB was similar to the effect of FK506 ( Figure Sa ) .
The sensitivity of NFxB mediated transcription to calcium ionophore treatment may be specific for T lymphocytes since in a pre-B cell line 70Z/3 we did not detect any augmentation of the transcriptional activity of NFxB by ionomycin treatment ( Figure 5b ) .
Furthermore , NFxB was not sensitive to cyclosporin A or FK506 in 702/3 cells ( Figure 5b ) .
An association between Ca** mobilization and the effect of cyclosporin A and FK506 was also observed with other transcription factors .
A small but significant transcriptional activity of NF-AT was generated by ionomycin treatment alone and this activity was inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506 ( Figure Sa ) .

Ca ' * ionophore enhanced the expression of c-fos mRNA by ~ 3-fold over the induction seen with phorbol ester alone .
However , cyclosporin A and FK506 had no effect on the level of c-fos expression ( Figure 6 ) .
In addition , FK506 did not affect the calcium ionophore dependent DNA binding activity of AP-1 ( Figure 3c¢c ) .
The AP-1 binding site is recognized by a heterodimer of c-jun and c-fos which leads to the activation of transcription ( Halazonetis et al .
, 1988 ) .
The finding that the Ca** regulated transcriptional activity of AP-1 was not affected by cyclosporin A or FK506 is consistent with the finding that the Ca** mobilization dependent expression of c-fos mRNA was not inhibited by FK506 ( Figure 6 ) .
Requirement of protein synthesis for transcriptional activities inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506 We investigated whether protein synthesis is required for the signalling pathway inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506 .
Ribonuclease protection assays were performed to quantitate lacZ mRNA transcribed under the control of NFIL2A , NFIL2B and NFxB transcription factors in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor , anisomycin .
Transcriptional activities of NFIL2A and NFIL2B were inhibited by anisomycin as quantitated by lacZ mRNA transcribed under the control of NFILZA or NFIL2B transcription factors ( Figure 7b and c ) .

Jurkat cells that contained stable integrants of the NFxB-lacZ construct ( described in Figure 4a ) were stimulated for 90 min with phorbol ester or with phorbol ester together with calcium ionophore in the presence or absence of FK506 and anisomycin .

Discussion We have shown that both cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibit the activity of several transcription factors involved in the activation of T lymphocytes and that the effects of these compounds are indistinguishable except for a consistent 100-fold difference in their effective concentration .
Fifty percent inhibition of transcription was observed at concentrations of cyclosporin A and FK506 that are close to their binding constants to cyclophilin and FKBP , respectively , supporting previous reports which suggest that cyclophilin and FKBP mediate the effects of cyclosporin A and FK506 , respectively ( Handschumacher et al .
, 1984 ; Harding et al .
, 1989 ; Siekierka et al .
, 1989 ) .
All the transcriptional activities that were inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506 required increased intracellular Ca'* .
The strong correlation between a requirement for Ca `` * mobilization and sensitivity to cyclosporin A and FK506 suggests that these drugs interfere with the activity of a regulated signalling pathway .
However , only a subset of Ca** regulated signalling pathways is affected by cyclosporin A or FK506 since the regulated expression of c-fos mRNA was not inhibited by these drugs .
The Ca** mobilization-dependent transcriptional activity of NFxB was inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506 and it was also partially inhibited by a protein synthesis inhibitor .
Previously the transcriptional activity of NFxB has been reported to be independent of new protein synthesis ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986 ) .
Signal transduction through NFxB can be initiated by the activation of protein kinase C which leads to the dissociation of NFxB from IxB in the cytoplasm and to the translocation of active NFxB into the nucleus , a process which does not require new protein synthesis 4430 ( Bauerle and Baltimore , 1988 ) .
It is possible that co-stimulation with calcium ionophore and phorbol ester leads additionally to the transcription of new NFxB or to the transcription of a factor similar to NFxB .
This effect may be specific for T lymphocytes since we did not detect such a Ca** dependent augmentation in transcriptional activity of NFxB in the pre B cell line , 702/3 .
Although the activity of some subspecies of protein kinase C are sensitive to ( Nishizuka , 1988 ) the finding that the dependent activity of NFxB required new protein synthesis indicates that a direct activation of protein kinase C by increased intracellular Ca** does not completely explain the observed Ca'* dependent activity of NFxB in T lymphocytes .
Recently , Schmidt et al .
( 1990 ) have also reported that the activation of NFxB is inhibited by cyclosporin A in a signal dependent manner .
Since cyclosporin A and FK 506 inhibit the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activities of cyclophilin and FKBP respectively , the inhibited isomerase activities might mediate the effects of cyclosporin A and FK506 .
Proline cis-trans isomerism has been proposed to regulate other processes , namely the activity of transport proteins ( Brand ] and Deber , 1986 ) , binding of concanavalin A to sugar residues ( Brown et al .
, 1977 ) and binding of prothrombin fragment 1 to phospholipid ( Marsh et al .
, 1979 ) .
Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity has been reported to affect the folding of proteins in vitro ( Lang et al .
, 1987 ; Lin et al .
, 1988 ) and thus it may be involved in the refolding of new proteins in vivo after synthesis on the ribosome .
If this is the case , the effect of cyclosporin A and FK506 may therefore be associated with events that require new protein synthesis .
Although transcriptional activities of NF-AT ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ) , NFILZA and NFIL2B did require new protein synthesis we did observe a small inhibitory effect of FK506 in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor , anisomycin , on the transcriptional activity of NFxB .
This suggests that the inhibitory effect of FK506 on transcription may not always require new protein synthesis .
However , it is still possible that anisomycin did not completely inhibit protein synthesis .
Recently we have shown that rapamycin , which is structurally related to FK506 , binds to FKBP with a binding affinity similar to that of FK506 and also inhibits the isomerase activity of FKBP ( Bierer et al .
, 1990 ) .
In contrast to FK506 , rapamycin does not inhibit T cell activation induced by signals from the antigen receptor but , on the contrary , when added in 500-fold excess reverses the effect of FK506 on interleukin 2 production ( Bierer et al .
, 1990 ; Dumont et al .
, 1990 ) and on all the transcription factors that were inhibited by FK506 ( P.Mattila and G.Crabtree , unpublished results ) .
These results do not favor the involvement of the isomerase activity in signal transduction in T lymphocytes but rather can be explained by a model in which FK506 forms an inhibitory complex with FKBP that interferes with signal transduction of T lymphocytes ( Bierer et al .
, 1990 ) .
A similar model which includes a complex of a protein homologous to cyclophilin and cyclosporin A has previously been demonstrated for cyclosporin A mediated toxicity in N. crassa and S. cerevisiae ( Tropschug et al .
, 1989 ) .
Since cyclophilin and FKBP are proline isomerases and thus may be involved in the folding of several proteins they may have an intrinsic characteristic of interacting with many different proteins .
Binding to cyclosporin A and FK506 could give them a new specificity to interfere with protein ( s ) important in signal transmission in T lymphocytes .
Cyclophilin and FKBP may directly interact with all four different transcription factors inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506 .
This is made less likely by the observation that we did not find a single transcription factor among six tested ( NF-AT , NFIL2A , NFIL2B , NFxB , AP-1 or SP-1 ) that was inhibited by one but not by both cyclosporin A and FK506 .
This suggests that a novel Ca `` * dependent step proximal to the transcription factors in signal transduction of T lymphocytes is the target of both cyclosporin A and FK506 .
Materials and methods Plasmids The £ .
coli lacZ -galactosidase gene was a BamHI fragment of PMC1871 ( Shapira er al .
, 1983 ) and was initially cloned into the BamHI site of SP65 ( Promega ) .
The initiation of translation was derived from the MoMuLV envelope gene and was cloned by inserting a synthetic sequence CTAGAC-TGACATGGCGGATC between the Xbal and BamHI sites of SP65 .
This construct , called was constructed by Constance Cepco ( Harvard Medical School , Boston ) and Jack Price ( Mill Hill MRC , England ) .
Polyadenylation sequence and small t intron of SV40 was derived from a Sall and HindIII fragment of pko-neo ( van Doren et al .
, 1984 ) .
An Xhol linker was inserted inside this fragment into a BamHI site 3 ' of the polyadenylation sequence .
The fragment was blunt ended by Klenow fragment and ligated to the Smal site of SP65 .
The resulting plasmid , called A , originated from Jacik Skowronski ( Cold Spring Harbour , New York ) .
The hygromycin resistance gene under the transcriptional control of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter was derived as a blunt ended Narl -Nrul fragment from pHYg ( Sugden er al .
, 1985 ) .
This fragment was ligated to the Smal site of pTZ19 ( Pharmacia ) and a Bg/II linker was inserted into a SacI site filled in by Klenow fragment of the pTZ19 .
The lacZ with the inserted initiation of translation and polyadenylation sequences was cut out from SP6-SgalpolyA with HindIII and Xf : ol and ligated between the HindIII and Sall sites of the modified pTZ19 .
The resulting plasmid Signal transduction in T lymphocyte activation is called pLacZH and it has the lacZ gene 5 ' of the hygromycin resistance gene .
The orientations of transcription of both genes are the same .
The fragment carrying the lacZ and hygromycin resistance genes was cleaved from pLacZH with HindIII and Bg/lI and inserted in the place of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene which was removed with HindIII and BamHI from the following plasmids : pIL2CAT ( Durand er al .
, 1988 ) which has sequences -326 to +47 from interleukin 2 gene controlling the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene , NFAT.22.6 which has three copies of the NF-AT binding site linked to the interleukin 2 promoter ( -72 to +47 of interleukin 2 ) , pA 4.1 which has four copies of the NFIL2A binding site linked to ~ fibrinogen minimal promoter ( Durand et al .
, 1988 ) , X , CAT which has three copies of the AP-1 binding site from the metallothionein gene enhancer linked to the SV40 minimal promoter ( Lee etal .
, 1987 ) , KBCAT which has three copies of the human immunoglobulin x light chain x B site ligated to -72 of interleukin 2 minimal promoter and NFIL2BCAT which has four copies of NFIL2B binding site from interleukin 2 gene linked to interleukin 2 minimal promoter .
The resulting plasmids were called pIL2ZH , NFATZH , NFIL2AZH , X , ZH , KBZH and NFIL2BZH respectively .
NFAT.22.6 was constructed by Cor Verweij by inserting three copies of the NF-AT binding sequence ( -286 to -257 of interleukin 2 gene ) into the XAol site of p22/6 which was a deletion mutant from pIL2CAT and had sequences between -296 and -72 relative to interleukin 2 transcription start site deleted and a Xhol linker inserted in place of the deletion ( Verweij et al .
, 1990 ) .
KBCAT was constructed by annealing oligonucleotides gatc and gatcCTCGGAAAGTCCCCTCTGA and ligating the annealed product with itself .
The ligation product was filled in with Klenow enzyme and ligated to the filled in XhoI site of p22/6 .
The resulting plasmid contained three copies of the x B site , the two 5 ' ones in the reverse orientation in respect to the orientation of the x B sites in the x immunoglobulin gene .
NFIL2BCAT was constructed by annealing oligonucleotides tegaCAATT-CCAAAGAGTCATCAGAAGAGGAC and tegaGTCCTCTTCTGATGA-CTCTTTGGAATTG and ligating the double stranded sequence into the Xhol site of p22/6 .
NFIL2BCAT has four copies of the NFIL2B binding site linked to the minimal interleukin 2 promoter in the same orientation as the NFIL2B site in the interleukin 2 gene .
The orientations of the inserted genes were confirmed with sequencing .
The resulting plasmids were linearized for electroporation with KpnI which cuts immediately 3 ' of the hygromycin resistance gene .
Transfections and selection of clones Cell lines with stable integrants of the constructs were established by electroporating linearized plasmids into Jurkat cells and selecting with hygromycin .
The cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % v/v fetal calf serum , 100 U/ml penicillin and 50 U/ml streptomycin in a 5 % CO ; , /95 % air atmosphere .
Ten million cells were electroporated with 20 ug of linearized plasmid in 1 ml RPMI 1640 using a 250 V and 960 F electric shock ( Gene Pulser , Bio-Rad ) .
Immediately after electroporation cells were suspended in 24 ml of tissue culture media and 1 ml aliquots were added into a 24 well plate .
The following day hygromycin was added in 1 ml of culture media to each well to give a final concentration of 200 ug/ml of hygromycin ( Calbiochem , CA ) .
Hygromycin containing media was changed periodically until resistant cells grew out which usually occurred in 2 weeks .
Clones expressing high levels of lacZ after stimulation were selected and cloned using fluorescence activated cell sorter ( FACS ) and the fluorogenic substrate fluorescein-di-galactoside ( Nolan et al .
, 1988 ) .
The following cell clones were used .
IL2.2A , 1L2.7B , IL2.11A ( transfected with IL2ZH ) ; NFAT.4B , NFAT.5A ( transfected with NFATZH ) ; NFIL2A.4.4 , NFIL2A.11.5 , NFIL2A.20.9 ( transfected with NFIL2AZH ) ; NFIL2B.6.1 , NFIL2B.11.2 ( transfected with NFIL2BZH ) : KB.2.2 , KB.5.2 , KB.7.2 ( transfected with KBZH ) and X.7.1 ( transfected with X ; ZH ) .
The cell line J.NFATZ.1 that was transfected with a construct containing three copies of NF-AT binding sites controlling the expression of lacZ is described by Fiering er al .
( 1990 ) .
Cell lines J.NFATZ.1 , KB.5.2 , NFIL2B.11.5 and NFIL2B.6.1 were used for ribonuclease protection assays .
Stimulation of cells All stimulations were done with exponentially growing cells whose density was not greater than 0.5 million cells/ml .
Cells were stimulated in fresh tissue culture media at a density no higher than 0.7 million cells/ml .
Stock solutions of phorbol myristate acetate ( Sigma ) and ionomycin ( Calbiochem ) were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide and stock solutions of cyclosporin A , FK506 and anisomycin were prepared in ethanol and stored at -20°C .
Ribonuclease protection assay KSgal which was a template for the lacZ RNA probe was constructed by cutting Bluescript KS ( - ) vector ( Stratagene ) with Smal/Xhol and inserting 4431 P.Mattila ot al .
a Xhol-Pvull fragment from NFATZH which contains promoter sequences from interleukin 2 ( from -72 to +47 ) and lacZ sequences .
KSgal was linearized with Kprl and the RNA probe was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase .
The probe was 310 bp long and a 172 bp fragment was protected by lacZ mRNA .
This probe also protected a 47 bp fragment of endogenous interleukin 2 mRNA .
The probe was used to detect lacZ and interleukin 2 mRNA in all cell lines except in J.NFATZ.1 which contained a different translational initiation site for lacZ .
The template used for the RNA probe for detecting lacZ RNA in this cell line is described by Fiering et al .
( 1990 ) .
The probe was 370 bp long and the fragment protected by lacZ mRNA was 250 bp long .
The template for c-fos riboprobe was constructed by cutting a 200 bp Nsil-Tth111I fragment from the 3 ' untranslated region of the human c-fos gene and cloning this fragment into Psfl and Smal sites of SP65 ( Promega ) by first filling in the TH 11 LI site by Klenow enzyme .
The resulting plasmid was linearized with HindIII and the RNA probe was synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase .
The resulting RNA probe was 250 bp long and the size of the fragment protected by c-fos mRNA was 200 bp .
Ribonuclease protection was carried out essentially as described by Melton et al .

for 10 min in a Beckman TLC 100 rotor .
An equal volume of 3 M ( NH , ) ; , SO , was added to the supernatant and precipitated proteins were pelleted at 50 000 r.p.m .
for 10 min and resuspended in 50-100 gl of buffer C. Protein samples were desalted by ' passage over a P6DG column ( Bio-Rad ) .
Concentrations of proteins were determined by the Bradford assay ( Bradford , 1976 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility assays were done essentially as described ( Fried and Crothers , 1981 ; Garner and Revzin , 1981 ) .
