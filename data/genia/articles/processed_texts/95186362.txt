Samamary - Clinical outcome in ovarian carcinoma is predicted by progesterone receptor status .
indicating an endocrine aspect to this disease .
Peripheral leucocyte genomic DNAs were obtained from 41 patients with primary ovarian carcinoma and 83 controls from Ireland , as well as from 26 primary ovarian carcinoma patients and 101 controls in Germany .
Southern analysis using a human progesterone receptor ( hPR ) cDNA probe identified a germline Tagl restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) defined by two alleles : Tl .
represented by a 2.7 kb fragment ; and T2 , represented by a 1.9 kb fragment and characterised by an additional Taq ] restriction site with respect to Tl .
An over-representation of T2 in ovarian cancer patients compared with controls in the pooled Irish/German population ( P < 0.025 ) was observed .
A difference ( P < 0.02 ) in the distribution of the RFLP genotypes between Irish and German control populations was also observed .
The allele distributions could not be shown to differ significantly from Hardy-Weinberg distribution in any subgroup .
Using hPR cDNA region-specific probes , the extra Tag !
restriction site was mapped to intron G of the hPR gene .
Keywords : progesterone receptor gene ; RFLP ; ovarian carcinoma Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among patients with gynaecological cancers with a 5 year survival rate , averaged over all stages , of 29-32 % ( Scully , 1987 ) .
Such high mortality is due largely to the insidious early progression of the disease and consequent detection at an advanced tumour stage .
The absence of a sufficiently specific and sensitive screening test for diagnosis or prognosis of the disease compounds the problem of its treatment .
Progesterone receptor estimation yields prognostic information in ovarian carcinoma ( Slotman et al .
, 1990 ; Chadha et al .
, 1993 ; Noguchi et al .
, 1993 ) , indicating a positive relationship between progesterone receptor expression and prognosis .
The cDNA for the human progesterone receptor ( hPR ) was first cloned and sequenced by Misrahi et al .
( 1987 ) and later by Kastner et al .
( 1990 ) .
The structure of the hPR gene has recently been described ( Figure 1a ) ( Misrahi et a/ .
, 1993 ) .
The presence of multiple forms of the hPR in ovarian carcinoma has been reported ( Scharl et al .
, 1991 ) .
Loss of heterozygosity at the 11g23 locus in ovarian carcinoma has been reported ( Foulkes et al .
, 1993 ) , indicating the presence in this region of a tumour-suppressor gene relevant to ovarian carcinoma .
The hPR gene has been mapped by separate groups to the 11q22-q23 locus ( Rousseau-Merck et al .
, 1987 ; Mattei et al .
, 1988 ) .
Transfection of an ovarian carcinoma cell line with chromosome 11 has resulted in suppression of growth ( Cao et al .
, 1993 ) , further suggestive of the presence of tumour-suppressive regions on this chromosome .
Restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) are somatic or hereditary variations in the length of a DNA fragment yielded by specific restriction endonuclease diges-tion .
Steroid hormone receptor gene RFLPs have been previously studied in human female malignancies .
A HindIII polymorphism in the progesterone receptor gene exhibited non-Mendelian distribution in primary breast tumours ( Fuqua et al .
, 1991 ) .
A HindIII polymorphism of the oestrogen receptor gene was found to correlate with progesterone receptor expression in primary breast tumours ( Wanless et Correspondence : DR Headon *Present address : Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas 77030 , USA .
Received 22 September 1994 ; revised 31 October 1994 ; accepted 1 November 1994 al .
, 1991 ) .
Furthermore , a specific pattern of differential expression of the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor ( COUP-TF ) , an orphan of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily , has been identified in human ovarian cancer cell lines ( Kieback et a/ .
, 1993 ) , indicating the possible role of this novel steroid receptor in ovarian carcinoma .
The Tag !
restriction endonuclease recognition site TCGA , containing all four base pairs found in DNA , allows analysis of all 12 potential single base pair mutations ( Sandy et al .
, 1992 ) .
The presence in this recognition site of the di-nucleotide sequence CpG is of particular importance given that deamination of cytosine or S-methylcytosine in CpG dinucleotides is a common mechanism for the formation of C to T transitions in cancer-related genes ( Hollstein et a/ .
, 1991 ) .
For these reasons , Tagl is especially useful in discerning polymorphic alleles by RFLP analysis .
In order to investigate the status of the hPR gene in primary ovarian carcinoma , we analysed peripheral leucocyte genomic DNA from ovarian carcinoma patients and controls for appearance of a germline Tagl RFLP in the hPR gene .
Materials and methods Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and hPR cDNA region-specific probes Refer to Figure 1 .
Screening of a Agtll random-primed T47D human breast cancer cell line cDNA library with a 2 kb chick oviduct progesterone receptor cDNA ( both gifts from Dr BW O'Malley , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX , USA ) yielded a 1.85 kb cDNA , hPR-1 , which was subsequently cloned in pGEM-4 ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) using EcoRI to yield pGEM-4-hPR-1 ( Clifford-Brougham , 1989 ) .
The hPR-1 cDNA ( Figure 1b ) consists of 1846 base pairs ( bp ) , of which 1084 bp represent 3 ' coding sequence and the remaining 762 bp is 3'-untranslated sequence .
hPR-1 probe was prepared for Southern analysis by digestion of pGEM-4-hPR-1 with EcoRI ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , under conditions specified by the manufacturer , and purified twice by electroelution after separation on a 1 % agarose electro-phoresis gel .
The hPR-2 cDNA probe ( Figure lc ) was generated by PCR using sense primer no .

Polymerase chain reactions ( PCRs ) were carried out in a 100 pul final volume of 10 mM Tns-HCl , 1.5 mM magnesium chloride and 50 mM potassium chloride using 50 ng each of the oligonucleotide primer pair , 100 ng of template pGem-4-hPR-1 , 1.5 mm of each dNTP and 2.5 units of Tag DNA polymerase ( all PCR reagents from Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Each amplification cycle ( 30 in total ) consisted of a 90s denaturation step at 94°C , a 90 s annealing step at 55°C and a 90 s extension step at 72°C .
PCR products were purified on a 1 % low-melt agarose gel ( NuSieve GTG ; FMC Bioproducts , Rockland , ME , USA ) before nick translation *P-labelling .
DNA extraction , restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blot analysis Genomic DNA was isolated from whole human blood by a modification of the method of Miller et al .
( 1988 ) .
Thawed whole blood was incubated with an equal volume of 10 mM Tris-HCl-10 mM EDTA ( pH 8.0 ) and centrifuged at 5000 r.p.m .
for 10 min at 4°C .
The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl-10 mM EDTA ( pH 8.0 ) and centrifuged at 5000 r.p.m .

After spectrophotometric determination of DNA concentration and purity , 20 ug of each DNA was digested to completion with 40 units of Tagl ( Boehringer Mannheim ) in a volume of 300 pul at 65°C overnight under conditions specified by the manufacturer .
The digested DNA samples were fractionated on a 0.8 % agarose gel and following denaturation ( 1.5 M sodium chloride , 0.5 M sodium hydroxide ) and neutralisation ( 1.5 M sodium chloride , 0.5 m Tris pH 7.2 , 0.001 M EDTA ) DNA was transferred from the gel in 20 x SSC ( 3 M sodium chloride , 0.3 M sodium citrate ) by capillary action to a 6 x SSC-soaked nylon membrane ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
After overnight transfer of DNA , the membranes were washed in 2 x SSC and baked for 2h at 80°C .

Statistical analysis Comparison of the observed genotypic distribution of the Taql hPR alleles between subgroups was carried out , where appropriate , using y ' analysis Calculation of expected genotypic frequencies was performed using the Hardy-Weinberg equation and these expected frequencies were compared by 1 `` analysis , using Yates ' correction for expected classes less than 5 , with the observed frequencies in each subgroup ( Ayala and Kiger , 1980 ) .
Results Characterisation of Taq ) polymorphism Figures 2-4 show representative Southern hybridisation analyses of peripheral leucocyte genomic DNA using Tagl as the restriction enzyme and the region-specific cDNA fragments hPR-1 , hPR-2 and hPR-3 respectively as the probes ( Figure lb-d ) .
A single , two-allele polymorphism was detected , comprising Tl , represented by an estimated 2.7 kb fragment , and T2 , represented by an estimated 1.9 kb fragment , and characterised by possession of an additional Tagl restriction site with respect to TI .
Three genotypes were detected : 2.7 kb/2.7 kb , individuals homozygous for the Tl allele ( Figure 2 , lanes 1 and 2 ) ; 2.7 kb/l.9 kb , individuals heterozygous for the Tl and T2 alleles ( Figure 2 , lane 3 ) ; and 1.9 kb/l.9 kb individuals homozygous for the T2 allele ( Figure 3 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .

Figure 2 shows three Taql-digested genomic DNA samples probed with the hPR-1 cDNA probe ( Figure 1b ) .
The restriction fragment hybridisation pattern shows four invariant bands at approximately 5.0 , 4.2 , 3.5 and 0.6 kb and the two variant fragments at 2.7 kb and 1.9 kb .
Figure 3 shows the autoradiographic pattern when the hPR-2 cDNA probe ( Figure 1c ) was used .
As shown , the 1.9 kb fragment ( representing the T2 allele ) hybridised with the hPR-2 cDNA probe , indicating the presence of the extra Tagl site 3 ' to nucleotide position 2593 bp ( numbered from ATG1 ) .
Figure 4 shows four Tagql-digested samples probed with the hPR-3 cDNA probe ( Figure 1d ) .
As shown , neither the 2.7 kb nor the 1.9 kb fragment was detectable by this probe : the 0.6 kb fragment was detected , however , indicating that the addi- Figwre 2 Representative Southern analysis of Tagl-digested genomic DNA hybridised with the hPR-1 cDNA probe .

Progesterone receptor gene RFLP in ovarian carcinoma NJ McKenna et al aa tional Tagl site lies 5° to 3133 bp ( numbered from ATG !
1 ) .
When the hPR-2 cDNA probe ( Figure 1c ) was used , the 1.9 kb fragment co-segregated with an inconsistently hybridising smaller fragment of 0.8-1.0 kb , suggesting that the latter fragment is composed of predominantly intron G sequence and has limited sequence overlap with the hPR-2 cDNA probe compared with the 1.9 kb fragment .
These data are consistent with the location of an additional Tagl site in intron G of the T2 hPR allele generating , upon Tagl diges-tion , a 1.9 kb fragment which has extensive sequence overlap with the hPR-2 cDNA probe , and a smaller fragment composed of predominantly intron G sequence .
It is notable that the numbers of restriction fragments hybridising to each of the three cDNA probes hPR-1 , hPR-2 and hPR-3 are consistent with the location of the Tagl cDNA restriction sites according to Kastner et al .
( 1990 ) in the human progesterone receptor cDNA ( Figure 1 ) .
Allelic distribution and frequency in ovarian cancer patients and controls Significant differences in the distribution of Tl and T2 alleles were observed between the pooled German/Irish ovarian carcinoma cases and in the pooled controls ( P < 0.025 ) ( Table I ) .
No significant difference could be demonstrated in the distribution of the alleles between cases and controls in Ireland ( P= 0.18 ) .
The frequency of the T2 allele could not be shown to differ significantly ( P > 0.4 ) between the case groups of both countries , but was significantly higher in the Irish control group than in the German control group Figure 4 Localisation of the additional Tag !

The distribution of the two alleles in each group exhibited Mendelian distribution as predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equation , except in the pooled controls , in which significant deviation from that predicted was approached ( P < 0.15 ) .
Dé A Region-specific analysis of the hPR gene demonstrated the presence of an ovarian carcinoma-associated germline RFLP in intron G in the hormone-binding domain-encoding region of the gene .
The presence of multiple forms of the progesterone receptor in ovarian carcinoma has been reported ( Scharl et al .
, 1991 ) .
Possible explanations include multiple polyadenylation sites , differences in gene regulatory regions or alternative intron splicing .
It may be reasonably speculated that the polymorphism we have localised to intron G of the hPR gene has consequences for the integrity of the regulatory functions of the hormone-binding domain , possibly through premature termination of the progesterone receptor mRNA transcript or other faults in the splicing mechanism .
Hormone binding and regulated transcriptional activation by the progesterone receptor are dependent upon the presence of a complete , intact hormone-binding domain : deletion of part of this region induces a total loss of hormone-binding and the ability to activate transcription i : vitro ( Dobson et al .
, 1989 ) .
Although the precise nature of the polymorphism we have 1denuﬁedlsyettobedetermmed , anotheroonungencylsthat it is a neutral polymorphism co-segregating with other progesterone receptor gene aberrations as yet undetected , as has been suggested in the case of an intron A polymorphism in the oestrogen receptor gene in breast cancer ( Yaich et el .

Two distinct estsrogen-regulated promoters generate transcripts encoding the two functionally different human progesterone receptor forms A and B. EMBO J. , 9 , 1603-1614. question of a possible tumour-suppressive role for the hPR .
The 11q22-q24 locus contains a tumour-suppressor gene relevant to breast cancer ( Stickland et al .
, 1992 ) and cervical carcinoma ( Hampton et al .
, 1994 ) .
Our data give credence to the possibility of a tumour-suppressive role for the hPR gene in ovarian carcinoma .
Considering the hypothesis of Knudson ( 1971 ) that one defective copy of a tumour-suppressive gene is inherited and the other subject to a somatic mutation , the over-representation of the TI/T2 heterozygote in ovarian carcinoma patients suggests a possible scenario : that these individuals have inherited a defective copy of the hPR gene and that the other is subject to a somatic mutation .
Long-term prospective studies will be required to monitor the incidence of ovarian carcinoma in the control group , especially in those individuals with the T2/T2 genotype .
Whereas the frequency of the T2 allele is similar in the Irish and German case groups , the higher frequency of T2 in the Irish controls led to a smaller difference in T2 frequency between the Irish case and control groups , hence significance could not be established in this population in this study .
The fact that the distribution of the Tagl RFLP alleles approaches significant deviation from that predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equation ( P < 0.15 ) in the pooled controls will require further investigation .
To conclude , the current data show an association between a Taql RFLP and incidence of ovarian carcinoma .
This polymorphism is associated with ovarian cancer at a germline level , as opposed to the tumour level .
Further work will characterise its role in the development of ovarian carcinoma .
