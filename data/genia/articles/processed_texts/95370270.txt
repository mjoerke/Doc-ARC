Utilizing CD4 positive T cell lines and purified T cells from normal individuals , we have demonstrated that native envelope glycoproteins of HIV , gp160 , can induce activation of transcription factor , activated protein-1 ( AP-1 ) .
The stimulatory effects of gp160 are mediated through the CD4 molecule , since treatment of gp160 with soluble CD4-IgG abrogates its activity , and CD4 negative T cell lines fail to be stimulated with gp160 .
Immunoprecipitation of the gp160-induced nuclear extracts with polyclonal antibodies to Fos and Jun proteins indicates that AP-1 complex is comprised of members of these family of proteins .
The gp160-induced AP-1 complex is dependent upon protein tyrosine phosphorylation and is protein synthesis-independent .
This stimulation can also be abolished by inhibitors of protein kinase C , but it is unaffected by calcium channel blocker or cyclosporine A .
This gp160 treatment adversely affects the functional capabilities of T cells ; pretreatment of CD4+ T cells with gp160 for 4 h at 37 °C inhibited anti-CD3-induced interleukin-2 secretion .
Effects similar to gp160 were seen with anti-CD4 mAb .
The aberrant activation of AP-1 by gp160 in CD4 positive T cells could result in up-regulation of cytokines containing AP-1 sites , e.g .
interleukin-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and concurrently lead to T cell unresponsiveness by inhibiting interleukin-2 secretion .
The CD4 molecule is the binding site of the human immunodeficiency virus via the envelope glycoprotein , gp160/gp120 ( 1 ) .
This interaction occurs at a specific region at the external domain of the CD4 molecule .
There have been conflicting reports on the ability of gp160/gp120 to transduce biochemical signals through the CD4 molecule on T cells .
While increase in intracellular calcium , hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol , and activation of tyrosine kinases have been demonstrated by some ( 2-5 ) , others have failed to observe these events ( 6 , 7 ) .

phic $ 2 domain of the MHC class II molecule has been demonstrated to play a vital role in activation of mature T cells and in T cell development in the thymus ( 8 ) .
Several studies have now demonstrated that the CD4-MHC class II interaction is essential for effective signal transduction , at low antigen con-centrations , to increase the avidity , in co-receptor-dependent systems ( 9 , 10 ) .
Studies demonstrating the association of the sre homologous tyrosine kinase p56 `` and the putative p32 G-protein with the cytoplasmic tail of the CD4 molecule have demonstrated that biochemical signals can be transduced through the CD4 molecule ( 11 , 12 ) .
In this respect , exposure of CD4+ T cells to anti-CD4 mAb or HIV gp120 has been shown to induce activation of the Raf-l-related 110-kDa polypeptide , and phosphatidylinositol 3- and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases ( 13 ) and activation of NF-kB ( 14 ) .
Utilizing soluble envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1 , gp160 , we have previously demonstrated that CD4-mediated signals result in biological effects .
These include up-regulation of CD40 ligand in CD4+ T cells , resulting in polyclonal B cell differentiation ( 15 ) ; induction of IL-3 , IL-6 , and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA and cytokine secretion , which induce increased myelopoiesis ( 16 ) ; and increased expression of Fas antigen on CD44 T cells , resulting in accelerated apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( 17 ) .
To delineate the nature of the biochemical signals transduced through the CD4 molecule on T cells , we have investigated the ability of gp160 and anti-CD4 mAbs to induce activation of the transcription factor , activated protein 1 ( AP-1 ) .
Physiological activation of T cells through the T cell receptor results in the activation of AP-1 ( 18 ) .
AP-1 is a collection of homodimeric and heterodimeric protein complexes of the c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogene products ( 19 ) .
These proteins interact with a common DNA binding site , the TPA-responsive element ( TGACC/G ) TCA ) and activate gene transcription ( 20 ) .
The binding of AP-1 to the TPA-responsive element has been attributed to post-translational modification of preexisting members of the Fos and Jun family of proteins , involving phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events ( 21 ) .
Our results have demonstrated that the CD4-induced signals transduced by gp160 or anti-CD4 mAb gp160 in T cells result in activation of AP-1 by a mechanism that involves post-translational activation of Fos and Jun family of proteins .
Depression of antigen-specific T cell responses is a relatively early feature of HIV infection and precedes the quantitative decline of CD4+ T cells ( 22 ) .
Several investigators have clearly demonstrated the inhibitory effects of gp120 on normal T cell ' The abbreviations used are : MHC , major histocompatibility class ; HIV , human immunodeficiency virus ; AP-1 , activated protein-1 ; IL , interleukin ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; TCR , T cell receptor ; mAb , monoclonal antibody .

The mechanism of gp120-mediated inhibition of T cell responses involves inhibition of intracellular calcium mobilization , hydrolysis of inositol phos-phates , and activation of protein kinase C , and kinase activity of p56 `` * ( 24-28 ) .
The reduced proliferative responses were attributed to inhibition of decreased IL-2 mRNA expression and IL-2 secretion ( 25 ) .
In this study , we have suggested that binding of envelope glycoproteins of HIV to CD4+ T cells induces aberrant activation of the transcription factor AP-1 ( which plays a critical role in IL-2 gene transcription , Ref .
18 ) and results in inhibition anti-CD3 mAb-induced IL-2 secretion .

Stimulation of CD4 positive T cells with gp160 induces AP-1 activation .
Stimulation of E6-1 cells was carried out by the addition of medium alone ( Zane 1 , unsti ) or various concentrations of gp160 ( lanes 2 , 3 , and 4 ) and gp120 ( lanes 5 , 6 , and 7 ) , or 1 ug/ml of anti-CD4 mAb ( Leu3a , lane 8 ) or 50 ng/ml PMA ( lane 9 ) , for 4 h at 37 °C .
Lane 10 comprised of competition of AP-1 binding by 10 x cold AP-1 oligonucleotides corresponding to the IL-2 AP-1 site .
The hollow arrow indicates mobility of free probe , and the solid arrow indicates the position of specific AP-1 binding .
The result is a representative of at least five separate experiments .
EMSA-Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the consensus AP-1 binding sequence TTG ATG AGT CAG CGC GAA-3 ' ( 31 ) ) were obtained commercially ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and end-labeled with [ y*P ] JATP and polynucleotide kinase .
In some experiments , the binding site of AP-1 to the human IL-2 promoter ( 5'-AATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAGA-3 ' ) was used as a competitor ( 18 ) .
For each binding reaction , 10,000 cpm ( 0.2-0.5 ng ) of end-labeled oligonu-cleotide was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 5-8 ug of nuclear extract in the presence of 3 mg of sheared poly ( dI-dC ) ( Phar-macia Biotech Inc. ) .
The resulting DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis at 4 °C of 4 % polyacrylamide gels .
Unlabeled oligonucleotides used for competitions were added to nuclear extracts and poly ( dI-dC ) prior to the addition of labeled probe .
Gels were dried on a gel drier ( Bio-Rad ) and visualized by autoradiography .
In some experiments , nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies to ¢-Jun , c-Fos , or normal rabbit serum for 1 h on ice , followed by incubation with Protein A-conjugated Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) for 30 min at 4 °C .
After centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min , supernatants were analyzed for AP-1 binding in EMSA , as described above .
IL-2 Secretion-CD4+ E6-1 cells , CD4- JN cells , or purified CD4+ T cells were pretreated with medium , various concentrations of gp120 , or anti-CD4 mAb ( mAb Leusa ) followed by stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb ( mAb 454 ) plus 10 ng/ml PMA for 24 h. Culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for the presence of IL-2 by commercial ELISA kit ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
RESULTS gp160-induced AP-1 Activation in CD4+ T Cells-Fig .
1 shows that the basal level of AP-1 activation in the CD4+ E6-1 cells could be enhanced by stimulation with gp160 at a concentration as low as 0.01 mg/ml .
This concentration of envelope proteins has been previously reported in the serum of HIV-infected individuals ( 32 ) .
Soluble gp120 , anti-CD4 mAb ( Leu3a ) and PMA alone could also induce activation of AP-1 in the CD4+ E6-1 cells .
Specific binding was demonstrated by abrogation of the AP-1 binding in the presence of excess unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP-1 site in the IL-2 promoter ( competitor , lane 10 ) .

Kinetics of the gp160-induced AP-1 activation .
E6-1 cells were stimulated with 1 mg/ml gp160 for various time intervals indicated .
AP-1 binding was analyzed by EMSA .
The lower band shows nonspecific binding ( ns ) .
E6-1 cells stimulated for increasing amounts of time .
The gp160-induced AP-1 binding was observed within 30 min , peaked at 4 h , persisted for 24 h of stimulation ( Fig .
2 ) .
The gp160-induced AP-1 binding was specific , since it could be abrogated by pretreatment of gp160 with goat anti-gp120 polyclonal antibody ( Fig .
3 , compare lane 2 with lanes 6 and 7 ) ; normal goat serum had no significant effect on the stimulatory effect of gp160 ( lane 8 ) .
That the constituents of the gp160-induced AP-1 complex comprises Jun and Fos components was confirmed by abrogation of AP-1 binding by immunoprecipitation of the gp160-stimulated nuclear extracts with polyclonal antibodies to c-Jun and c-Fos ( Fig .
4 ) ; even the basal level binding of AP-1 was inhibited by the addition of these antibod-ies .
Normal rabbit serum had no significant effect on the gp160-induced AP-1 binding .
These results indicate that gp160 can induce activation of AP-1 in CD4+ T cells and that the AP-1 complex consists of Fos/Jun family of proteins .
The gp160-induced Activation of AP-1 Was Mediated through the CD4 Molecule-In order to demonstrate that the cell surface molecule involved in the gp160-mediated stimulatory effects was CD4 , gp160 was first preincubated with soluble CD4- IgG for 30 min at 4 °C , prior to addition to the cell cultures .
Fig .

An irrelevant protein , bovine serum albumin , did not have any effect on the gp160-induced activation of AP-1 ( lane 5 ) .
In order to further demonstrate that gp160-induced activation of AP-1 was mediated through the CD4 molecule , CD4+ and CD4 negative T cell lines were analyzed .
Fig .
5 shows that gp160 could stimulate AP-1 activation in CD4+ H9 cells , Molt4 cells , but not in CD4 negative mutant Jurkat T cells ( JN ) .
Here again , pretreatment of gp160 with soluble CD4 abrogated AP-1 activation in CD4+ T cells .
All of these cells could be effectively induce AP-1 activation upon stimulation with PMA .
These results demonstrate that the stimulatory activity of gp160 on AP-1 activation is mediated through the CD4 molecule .
Gp160 Induced AP-1 Activation in Peripheral Blood CD4+ T Cells-In order to determine the ability of gp160 to activate physiological cells and peripheral blood T cells , purified T cells were first stimulated with gp160 for 4 h at 37 °C .
CD4+ T cells were separated from CD8+ T cells by negative selection using anti-CD8 mAb-conjugated magnetic beads ; cells bound to the beads were designated CD8+ , and unbound T cells designated CD8- .
Fig .
6 shows that stimulation of CD8- T cells ( > 90 % CD4+ by flow cytometry ) with gp160 induced AP-1 activation ( upper right panel ) no activation of AP-1 occurred in the CD8+ T cells ( upper left panel ) .
The stimulatory effects of gp160 on CD8- T cells could be abrogated by pretreatment of gp160 with soluble CD4- IgG ( lower panel ) .
Soluble CD4- IgG itself did not induce activation of AP-1 ( data not shown ) .

Table I shows that gp120- or anti-CD4 mAb-treated E6-1 cells and CD4+ peripheral blood T cells were markedly inhibited in their ability to secrete IL-2 in response to anti-CD3 mAb .
Pretreatment of the CD4 negative T cells ( JN ) cells with gp120 or anti-CD4 mAb , however , had no effect on anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA-induced IL-2 secretion .
DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that the addition of gp160 to CD4+ T cells induces activation of transcription factor AP-1 by signals transduced directly through the CD4 molecule .
Signals transduced through the CD4 molecule on T cells has been shown to play an important role in regulating T cell functional responses mediated through the T cell receptor ( 8 ) .
Earlier studies had implicated that the binding ( adhesion ) of the CD4 molecule with its natural ligand , MHC class II molecule , participated in T cell activation by stabilizing the T cell receptor ( TCR ) -MHC interactions ( 34 ) .
In addition , inhibition of T cell activation by anti-CD4 mAbs in MHC class II independent systems suggested that inhibitory signals were transduced through the CD4 molecule ( 35 ) .
In contrast , recent experiments have indicated that positive signals may be induced via the CD4 molecule , either by anti-CD4 mAbs ( 36 ) or by HIV envelope glycoproteins , gp160/gp120 ( 2-5 ) .
Although the CD4-induced signals have been shown to synergize with anti-CD3 or anti-TCR mAb ( 37 ) the aberrant persistent activation through this molecule on T cells , may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease , e.g .
in HIV infection ( 38 ) .
Cellular activation plays a central role in HIV infection ( 22 ) .
Virus internalization , syncitium formation , and proviral replication have been shown to require cellular activation ( 39 , 40 ) .
Several investigators have demonstrated that binding of gp160/gp120 to CD4 molecules on the cell surface results in activation of biochemical signals ( 2-5 ) .
We have demonstrated that binding of gp160 , ( at concentrations found in vivo , ( 32 ) ) to CD4 molecules on T cells can induce biological events , e.g .
up-regulation of CD40 ligand ( 15 ) , secretion of IL-6 , IL-3 , granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor , interferon y , tumor necrosis factor « ( 16 , 17 ) , and up-regulation of Fas antigen ( 17 ) on CD4* T cells .
These observations unequivocally dem 19368 onstrate that gp160 can transduce signals through the CD4 molecule in T cells culminating into biological events .
In the present study , we have demonstrated that gp160 can induce activation of AP-1 in CD4+ T cells .
The presence of Fos/Jun family of proteins in the gp160-induced AP-1 complex was confirmed by abrogation of AP-1 binding in immunoprecipitation experiments .
Further studies are needed to determine the involvement and functional role of individual Fos/Jun components in the gp160-induced AP-1 complex .
The stimulatory effects of gp160 are mediated through the CD4 molecule , since pretreatment of gp160 with soluble CD4- IgG abrogates its activity .
Furthermore , cell lines expressing the CD4 molecule ( H9 , Molt4 ) , but not CD4 negative cell line ( JN ) , can be induced by gp160 to activate AP-1 .
gp160 can also stimulate peripheral blood CD4 positive cells , but not CD8 positive T cells to activate AP-1 .
Finally , the stimulatory effects of gp160 can be mimicked by anti-CD4 mAb .
These results clearly demonstrate AP-1 activation by direct stimulation through the CD4 molecule .
Post-translational modifications upon T cell activation involve activation of pre-existing Fos/Jun by intracellular kinases and phosphatases ( 19 ) .
The observation that protein synthesis inhibitor , CHX failed to abrogate ( and in fact aug-ments ) the gp160-induced AP-1 binding at 4 h suggests that post-translational modification of preexisting Fos and/or Jun induces AP-1 binding at 4 h. Tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor , herbimycin A , abrogated the gp160-induced AP-1 binding .
In resting cells , the pre-existing Jun is phosphorylated on three sites at the C-terminal domain next to its DNA binding domains ( 21 ) ; phosphorylated states of these sites inhibits DNA binding ( 41 ) .
The activation of Jun requires dephosphorylation of these sites , possibly by a protein kinase C-activated phosphatase ( 42 ) .
Calcineurin , the phosphatase that modulates NFAT activity ( 43 ) , is not involved in c-Jun dephosphorylation , since AP-1 binding is unaffected by treatment of cells with cyclosporine A .
While intracellular calcium channel blocker , verapamil , failed to block AP-1 binding , the requirement of protein kinase C activation for the gp160-mediated AP-1 binding was demonstrated by the addition of inhibitors , H7 and calphostin .
Understanding the precise nature of the post-tran-scriptional modification involving activation of the Ha-Ras on-coprotein ( 44 , 45 ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway ( 46 ) , or the newly described JNK and SAPK pathways ( 47 , 48 ) may give an insight into the regulatory role of CD4-mediated signals in T cell activation .
AP-1 has been demonstrated to be target for T cell clonal anergy , as demonstrated by down-modulation of AP-1 binding and transactivation in anergized T cell clones ( 49 ) .
We and others have previously demonstrated that pretreatment of CD4+ T cells with envelope proteins of HIV-1 can induce unresponsiveness of T cells upon stimulation through TCRCD3 complex ( 23-26 ) .
It is possible that the stimulatory effect of gp160 on AP-1 binding , involving the repressive members of the Jun family , i.e .
JunB ( 50 , 51 ) , which may inhibit IL-2 gene transcription .
Our previous studies have demonstrated that pretreatment of T cell clones with envelope glycoproteins or anti-CD4 mAb inhibited IL-2 secretion at the tran-scriptional level ( 25 , 26 ) .
In this study , we have shown that pretreatment of the CD4+ T cells with gp160 or anti-CD4 mAb for 4 h at 37 °C ( which results in activation of AP-1 binding ) inhibits anti-CD3 plus PMA-induced IL-2 secretion .
Since the inhibition of IL-2 secretion by gp120 in these experiments was independent of the presence of antigen presenting cells , it can be hypothesized that signals mediated through the CD4 molecule in T cells , which results in activation of AP-1 , may interfere with signal transduction through the TCR-CD3 complex .
HIV-1 Glycoproteins Induce Activation of AP-1 in CD4+ T Cells Given that the promoters of IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-6 , granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor , TCR $ , and the HIV long terminal repeat contain AP-1 binding sites ( 18 , 52-56 ) , it is possible that the gp160-induced activation of AP-1 in T cells can regulate the expression of these molecules .
Since c-Jun and c-Fos have also been implicated in the mechanism of apoptosis ( 57 , 58 ) , it is possible that gp160-induced AP-1 activation may play a significant role in apoptosis mechanisms in HIV infec-tion .
In conclusion , we have demonstrated that soluble envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1 , gp160 , by binding to the CD4 molecule on T cells , may transduce signals that result in aberrant activation of AP-1 .
These effects by gp160 , or by HIV itself in vivo , may contribute to biological events , e.g .
enhanced HIV replication , hypergammaglobulinemia , increased cytokine secretion , hypercellularity in bone marrow , apoptosis , and induction of T cell unresponsiveness .
