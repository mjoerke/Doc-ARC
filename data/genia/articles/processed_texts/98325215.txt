Differential Expression of Nur77 Family Members in Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type 1-Infected Cells : Transactivation of the TR3/nur77 Gene by Tax Protein XIAOLIN CHEN , ' VLADIMIR ZACHAR , * `` CHAWNSHANG CHANG , `` PETER EBBESEN , ' anp XIANGDONG LIU'* Department of Virus and Cancer , Danish Cancer Society , DK-8000 Aarhus C , Denmark ; Institute of Virology , Slovak Academy of Sciences , Bratislava , Slovak Republic ; and George H.

We have demonstrated that in both HTLV-1-infected cells and Tax-expressing JPX-9 cells , TR3/nur77 is highly expressed , whereas neither NOR-1 nor NOT expression is detectable .
Transient transfection analysis further confirmed the Tax transactivation of the TR3/nur77 promoter but not the NOR-1 promoter in different cell types .
Furthermore , expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the NGFI-B ( rat homolog of TR3/Nur77 ) response element ( NBRE ) provided evidence that Tax-mediated transactivation resulted in the induction of a functional protein .
Cotransfection assays with the TR3/nur77 promoter sequence or the NBRE binding motif together with a series of Tax mutants have shown that Tax-induced TR3/nur77 expression is mediated by CREB/ATF-related transcription factors .
The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is an etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( 31 ) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 -associated myelopathy ( 14 , 30 ) .
Among all viral proteins , the most significant impact on the cellular biochemical machinery is exhibited by the 40-kDa regulatory phosphoprotein Tax ( reviewed in references 11 and 43 ) .
Tax has been shown to be a powerful transactivator of viral long terminal repeats as well as diverse cellular genes .
Tax exerts its effect by interacting with cellular transcription factors , which ultimately results in deregulation of a variety of gene promoters .
Previous studies have in particular demonstrated that Tax can induce persistent expression of several immediate-early genes , such as c-fos , c-jun , egr-1 , egr-2 , and fra-1 ( 12 , 13 , 18 , 37 ) .
These genes are involved in the control of normal cell growth and are modulated by a variety of growth-promoting agents including polypeptide growth factors , anti-gens , and diverse mitogens ( 19 ) .
In HTLV-1-infected cells , however , overexpression of immediate-early genes provides additional growth signals , which may thus lead to an aberrant cell proliferation and/or cell death .
The newly characterized immediate-early genes TR3 ( human homolog of # ur77 , NGFI-B , N10 , and TIS1 ; also termed NAK-1 ; in this report , designated as TR3/nur77 ) , NOT ( human homolog of NurrZ and RNR-1 ; also called TINUR ) , and NOR-1 ( also called MINOR ) encode three closely related transcription factors , which constitute a distinct Nur77 subfamily within the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily ( 4 , 16 , 20 , 22 , 25 , 27-29 , 32 , 35 ) .

It is activated by mitogenic serum growth factors in fibroblasts ( 16 , 32 ) , nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , membrane depolarization during neuronal differentiation of the pheochro-mocytoma cell line PC-12 ( 25 , 42 ) , and the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) signalling in immature thymocytes and T-cell hybrid-omas ( 21 , 40 ) .
Two other members of the Nur7 ?
7 family , NOR-1 and NOT , have extensive homology with TR3/Nur77 , and they both can be induced in response to mitogenic stimulation in a variety of cell types ( 20 , 22 , 28 ) .
Despite their close rela-tionship , the three members of the Nur77 family are differen-tially regulated , which indicates that they play distinctive roles .
In response to TCR stimulation , only TR3/Nur77 and NOR-1 appear to be rapidly induced to high levels in thymocytes and T-cell hybridomas , and moreover , constitutive expression of both TR3/Nur77 and NOR-1 , but not NOT in T lymphocytes , leads to massive apoptosis and upregulation of CD25 ( 6 ) .
Given the possibility that the transcription factors of the Nur77 family might be involved in the development of HTLV-1-related disease , we set out to investigate regulation of TR3/ Nur77 , NOR-1 , and NOT expression by the Tax transactivator .
Differential expression of Nur7 ?
7 family members in HTLV-1-infected T cells .
The Nur77 family members , TR3/Nur77 , NOR-1 , and NOT , have extensive homology in their DNA binding domains , zinc fingers , and A boxes .
However , in the N-terminal transactivation domain , NOR-1 and NOT are only 21 and 27 % homologous to the TR3/Nur77 protein , respectively .
Similarly , NOR-1 and NOT display in their transactivation domains only 36 % amino acid similarity ( 6 ) .
In order to circumvent the cross-hybridization in analyzing the expression of each of the Nur77 family members in HTLV-1-infected T cells , the TR3/nur77- , NOR-1- , and NOT -specific DNA probes were designed to correspond to the N-terminal region of the coding sequences .
To prepare the probes , TR3/nur77- , NOR-1- , and NOT voL .
72 , 1998 specific sequences were amplified with a cDNA pool from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by 50 ng of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( TPA ) per ml , 1 pg of calcium ionophore A23187 per ml , and 10 mg of cycloheximide per ml for 1 h. Primers specifically targeting each of the genes were used as follows : TR3/nur77 ( 5'-TCATGGACGGCTACA CAG and 5-GTAGGCATGGAATAGCTC ) , NOR-1 ( 5¢-CCT TGTCCGAGCTITTAACAG and CTTGG ) , and NOT ( 5'-AACCCTGACTATCAAATGAGTG and 5'-CAATGCAGGAGAAGGCAGAAAT ) .
Amplified sequences ( 517 bp for TR3/nur77 , 410 bp for NOR-1 , and 352 bp for NOT ) were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector ( Invitrogen , NV Leek , The Netherlands ) and verified by DNA sequencing .
For Northern blot analysis , the total RNA was isolated by the acid phenol extraction method ( 9 ) , and the samples amounting to 10 ug were fractionated in a formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride N membrane ( Milli-pore , Bedford , Mass . )
.
In the control experiments , the ran-dom-primed hybridization probes specific for tax and GAPDH were prepared with the pSGTax ( provided by M. Seiki , Kanazawa University , Kanazawa , Japan ) and pHcGAP ( provided by Feng Qiu , University of Heidelberg ) plasmids , respectively .
Hybridization was performed according to the standard protocol ( 34 ) .
Under stringent hybridization conditions , we were able to detect high levels of TR3/nur77 transcripts in both of the HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines , C8166-45 and MT-2 ( 2 , 15 , 33 ) ; however , in Jurkat , Hut-78 , and Molt-4 , the T-cell lines negative for HTLV-1 , expression of TR3/nur77 was undetectable ( Fig .
1 ) .
Interestingly , in none of the tested cell lines did transcriptional expression of NOR-1 and NOT take place , thus suggesting a differential regulation of the Nur77 family transcription factors in HTLV-1-infected cells .
Induction of TR3/nur77 expression by Tax protein .
To further investigate whether this constitutive expression of TR3/ nur77 is induced by Tax protein , we employed a Jurkat derivative cell line , JPX-9 , in which the fax gene is under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter ( 26 ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , induction of Tax by CdCl , resulted in a rapid activation of TR3/nur77 , with specific transcripts first observable at 4 h and increasing continuously afterwards .
In contrast to TR3/ nur77 , NOR-1 and NOT remained undetectable , similar to the situation in HTLV-1-transformed cell lines .
Furthermore , mutated Tax induced by CdCl ; in the control cell line JPX/M failed to transcriptionally activate all three Nur77 family members ( data not shown ) .
These data thus provide evidence that Tax is responsible for the high level of TR3/nur77 expression in HTLV-1-infected cells .
Tax-mediated transactivation of the TR3/rur77 promoter .
In order to analyze Tax transactivation , the TR3/nur77 promoter containing a 2,419-bp DNA sequence upstream of the transcription start site was cloned into the chloramphenicol ace-tyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter vector p-2149TR3CAT as described previously ( 38 ) .
The plasmid was contransfected along with the Tax-expressing plasmid pCMV-Tax ( 36 ) or the control plasmid pCMV into the choriocarcinoma line JEG-3 , the neuroblastoma line SK-N-SH , simian virus 40-transformed African green monkey cell line COS-7 , and NIH/3T3 mouse cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , Va. ) .
All transfection experiments were performed in six-well plates in triplicate with serum-free Optimum medium ( Life Technologies , Paisley , Scotland ) .
NIH/3T3 and COS-7 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine ( Life Technologies ) 24 h after the seeding of 3 X 10° cells/well .
For the transfection of JEG-3 and SK-N-SH , 4 X 10° cells/well were grown for 24 h and transfected with Lipofectin ( Life Technologies ) .
The cultures were further maintained for 36 to 48 h , at which time the NOTES - 6903 JPX-9 0 4 9 15 24 36 hrs * il TR3/nur77 NOR-1 NOT GAPDH mm “ FIG .

Expression of TR3/nur77 , NOR-1 , and NOT at the transcriptional level in HTLV-1-infected cell lines and in the JPX-9 cells stably transfected with tax .
The JPX-9 cells were analyzed after the Tax induction with 10 uM CdCl ; at the indicated intervals .
The amounts of TR3/nur77- , NOR-I- , NOT- , tax- , and GAPDH -specific transcripts were determined by Northern blotting .
The expression of the GAPDH gene was analyzed for standardization purposes .
CAT quantitation was performed with the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit ( Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) .
The activities in individual samples were normalized on the basis of protein content , which was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IIL ) .
Expression of Tax resulted in 5- to 195-fold induction of the CAT gene in different cell lines , suggesting that Tax can trans-activate TR3/nur77 in a broad range of cell types ( Fig .
2 ) .
In addition , we have also subcloned the NOR-Z promoter into the reporter vector and used it in parallel cotransfection experi-ments .
In contrast to TR3/nur77 , however , the NOR-1 promoter was only weakly stimulated by Tax , exhibiting less than 1/10 of the activity found with the TR3/nur77 promoter ( data not shown ) .
These data corroborate our previous analysis of transcriptional patterns as shown in Fig .

Recently , Cheng et al .
( 6 ) have demonstrated that TR3/ Nur77 , NOR-1 , and NOT can all bind to the NBRE motif and that the affinity of binding decreases from TR3/Nur77 to NOR-1 .
Because Tax can upregulate TR3/nur77 expression , the activation of the NBRE-mediated reporter gene is expected to take place as well .
To obtain experimental evidence , the firefly luciferase ( Luc ) reporter vectors containing one ( pB1a-Luc ) or eight [ p ( Bla ) s-Luc ] ( 41 ) NBRE consensus elements upstream of a minimal prolactin promoter of the pPro36-Luc vector ( 1 ) were used in cotransfection together with the Tax-expressing plasmid ( pCMV-Tax ) in Jurkat cells .
The method for transfection and detection of luciferase activity has been detailed previously ( 5 ) .
With the vector with a single NBRE , a more than 10-fold increase of luciferase gene expression was observed upon Tax transactivation , whereas in the case of the vector with eight NBREs the increase was more than 50-fold ( Fig .

( A ) Transactivation of the TR3/nur77 promoter by wild-type Tax and Tax mutants exhibiting distinct transcriptional activities in Jurkat cells .
The CAT reporter vector p-2149TR3CAT containing 2,149 bp of the TR3/nur77 promoter was cotransfected with the Tax expression plasmid pCMV-Tax or different Tax mutant plasmids .
The M22 mutant is deficient in the induction of the NF- « B pathway , M1 and M47 mutants are deficient in inducing the CREB/ATF pathway , and M7 is deficient in inducing both the NF- « B and CREB/ATF pathways .
The transient expression of the CAT reporter gene was quantitated by the CAT ELISA after the samples were normalized for the protein content .
Bars represent the means + standard errors of the means of three replicates .
( B ) Effect of wild-type Tax and Tax mutants with distinct transcriptional activities on NBRE activation in Jurkat cells .
The luciferase reporter construct p ( B1a ) , -Lue containing eight NBRE binding motifs was cotransfected along with the Tax expression plasmid pCMV-Tax or different Tax mutant plasmids .
The transient expression of the reporter gene was determined by a standard luciferase bioluminescence assay after the samples were normalized for the protein content .
Bars represent the means + standard errors of the means of three replicates .
activation of NBRE binding activity by Tax was also observed in several other cell types mentioned above ( data not shown ) .
These results thereby provide evidence that the functional TR3/Nur77 protein can be induced in HTLV-1-infected cells and that the Tax protein plays a role in modulation of the responses mediated by the TR3/Nur77 protein .
CREB/ATF-related transcription factors are possibly involved in Tax-induced TR3/Nur77 expression .
Tax protein exhibits at least two discrete domains which are involved in separate transcriptional regulatory pathways .
One of these pathways is mediated via the Rel-related family of kB enhancer-binding proteins , and the other is mediated via the CREB/ ATF-related family of transcription factors ( 36 ) .
To explore which region of Tax protein is involved in the TR3/nur77 transactivation , we employed Tax mutants which were defective in the induction of NF-kB ( pCMV-M22 ) , CREB/ATF ( pCMV-M1 and pCMV-M47 ) , and both NF- « B and CREB/ATF ( pCMV-M7 ) pathways ( 36 ) in contransfection experiments with Jurkat cells .
Mutant M22 , in which the capacity to activate the CREB/ ATF pathway remained preserved , exhibited only slightly diminished transactivation of the TR3/nur77 promoter , whereas mutants M1 and M47 , having no CREB/ATF activity , lost most of their transactivation potential ( Fig .
4A ) .
A mutation within the putative zinc finger domain which rendered Tax inactive in induction of both NF-kB and CREB/ATF pathways ( M7 ) totally abolished the transactivation by Tax .
Furthermore , similar experiments were performed with the same series of Tax mutants in order to assay activation of NBRE ( Fig .
4B ) .
The results obtained here paralleled closely those from the preceding experiments with TR3/nur77 promoter transactivation .
These data suggest that CREB/ATF-related transcription factors mediate the major pathway through which Tax induces TR3/Nur77 expression .
It is interesting to note that , despite functional relatedness , as suggested by high similarity in the DNA binding domains and the putative dimerizing domain , we have found that only TR3/Nur77 is induced by Tax .
This finding sheds new light on voL .
72 , 1998 the regulation of Nur77 family members since the previous study of TCR engagement in the thymocytes and T-cell hybrid-omas suggested that TR3/Nur77 expression is tightly linked only with NOR-1 coexpression ( 6 ) .
Moreover , on the basis of experiments analyzing activation by Tax of the Nur77 family recognition motif NBRE , it appears that induction of TR3/ nur77 , or any other hitherto-unrecognized family member , occurs through the CREB/ATF-mediated pathway .
In recent years , ample evidence has been accumulated to suggest that the Tax transactivator is implicated in neoplastic cell transformation by inducing immediate-early genes .
c-fos , fra-1 , egr-1 , and egr-2 , all of which are under physiologic conditions transiently activated following antigenic or mitogenic stimulation of T cells , have previously been found to undergo sustained induction as a result of Tax transactivation ( 12 , 13 , 18 , 37 ) .
In the present paper , we provide evidence that yet another immediate-early gene , TR3/nur77 , is subject to regulation by Tax .
However , it appears that the role of TR3/Nur77 in cell cycling may be complex .
In contrast to c-Fos , Fra-1 , Egr-1 , and Egr-2 , TR3/Nur77 has been found to be mainly involved in the induction of T-cell apoptotic death ( 6 ) .
The TR3/Nur77 pathway thus could provide , in addition to those of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF- « ) and Fas ligand , a more comprehensive explanation for apoptosis induced by Tax in T cells and murine fibroblasts ( 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 41 ) .
TR3/Nur77 is not expressed in the prenatal central nervous system ( CNS ) but is highly expressed in the adult rat brain in many areas including the olfactory bulb , cortex , basal ganglia , and hippocampus , suggesting its involvement in the development and maturation of specific sets of CNS neurons ( 44 ) .
Specific TR3/Nur77 expression can also be quickly induced by focal mechanical lesion of the brain , excitatory epileptogenic treatments with pilocarpine , and in vitro depolarization of neural cells ( 17 , 44 ) .
In particular , recent results have shown that the deregulation of TR3/Nur77 and its family members NOT and NOR-1 could possibly be involved in neuron degeneration in Parkinson 's disease ( 44 ) .
With respect to HTLV-1-associ-ated CNS disease , it has been suggested that a central role in the etiopathogenesis of tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy is played by highly activated HTLV-1-infected T cells secreting Tax protein ( 10 ) .
Interestingly , extracellular Tax is able to modulate gene expression in a way similar to that of cytokines ( 3 , 23 , 24 ) , and it has been shown to induce neurons to produce TNF-a « in vitro ( 10 ) .
In addition to the proposed role for TNF-a in the development of neuro-degenerative disorders , it is plausible that uncontrolled expression of TR3/Nur77 is also of importance .
Our own data , with neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH , provide initial experimental evidence for possible involvement of this transcription factor in HTLV-1-related disorders of the CNS .
