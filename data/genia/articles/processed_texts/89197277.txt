Immunology 1989 66 328-334 Novel region within the V , , gene promoter is responsible for tissue and stage-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes in human lymphoid neoplasms A. E. KOSSAKOWSKA & S. J. URBANSKI Department of Pathology , University of Calgary/Foothills Hospital , Calgary , Alberta , Canada Accepted for publication 1 November 1988 SUMMARY Immunoglobulin gene-specific transacting factors have been shown to play a role in lymphoid tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes .
The role of these factors in B-cell differentiation and stage-specific expression of these genes is , however , not fully understood .
We have used a model of human lymphoid neoplasia to address this question .
Different fragments of unrearranged human variable region of immunoglobulin kappa gene ( V , ) were used for cell-free in vitro transcription and DNA mobility shift assays .
Previously described enhancement of in vitro transcription that was only seen with nuclear extracts derived from B-cell neoplasms corresponding to the late stages of B-cell differentiation was shown to be dependent on the actions of these factor ( s ) on the DNA region within the V , gene promoter .
This region is located within the 920 bp fragment located 210 bp upstream from the coding region and this fragment represents a possible novel DNA region , which plays a role in the stage- and tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes .
INTRODUCTION Lymphoid tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes has been shown to be dependent on both the enhancer ( Ephrussi et al .
, 1985 ; Mercola et al .
, 1985 ) as well as promoter ( Gopal et al .
, 1985 ) sequences .
Several different protein factors have been shown to interact at specific DNA binding sites on the immunoglobulin genes ( Weinberger , Baltimore & Sharp , 1986 ; Sen & Baltimore , 1986b ; Mocikat et al .
, 1986 ; Landolfi , Capra & Tucker , 1986 ; Gimble , Levens & Max , 1987 ) , assayed by in vitro binding .
An octamer sequence located upstream of TATA motif has been shown to be sufficient for lymphoid-specific promoter activity ( Wirth , Staudt & Baltimore , 1987 ) .
Most of the factors described , however , are ubiquitous ( Weinberger et al .
, 1986 ; Mocikat et al .
, 1986 ) and sequences in immunoglobulin gene promoter/enhancer elements which bind these proteins were also discovered in other eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes ( Falkner , Mocikat & Zachau , 1986 ) .
Purification of the highly conserved octamer sequence-binding protein from human B cells has been achieved by sequence-specific DNA affinity Abbreviations : V , , variable region of human kappa light chain immunoglobulin gene ; ATP , adenosine 5'-triphosphate ; CTP , cytosine 5'-triphosphate ; FCS , fetal calf serum ; GTP , guanosine 5'-triphosphate ; MEM , minimal essential medium ; TE , Tris-EDTA ; UTP , uridine 5-triphosphate .

, 1987 ) .
This protein was found only , however , in cells of B-cell origin and some T cells , but not in cells of non-lymphoid lineage ( Staudt et a/ .
, 1986 ) .
DNase I hypersensitive sites discovered in kappa genes from nuclei of cells producing kappa immunoglobulin chains correlate with only some of the previously described putative regulatory sequences ( Pospelov , Klobeck & Zachau , 1984 ) .
In vitro transcription assays have been employed to establish the functional significance of the transacting factors .
It has been shown that the transcription of kappa light chain gene is more efficient in B-cell than HeLa extracts , the phenomenon dependent on promoter sequences ( Mizushima-Sugano & Roeder , 1986 ) .
Similarly , the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer stimulates in vitro transcription from Adenovirus-2 major late promoter in extracts derived from B but not HeLa cells ( Augerau & Chambon , 1986 ) .
Cell-specific transcriptional enhancement in vitro is dependent on the enhancer sequence of IgCu , demonstrated with the use of B-cell and to a lesser extent T-cell extracts , but not HeLa cell extracts ( Scholer & Gruss , 1985 ) .
The IgH enhancer has been shown to contain binding sites for both positive and negative regulatory factors , assayed by in vitro transcription from a heterologous promoter and by DNase I footprinting and DMS-methylation protection ( Augereau & Chambon , 1986 ) .
Furthermore , different mechanisms of regulation operate at different stages of B-cell differentiation ( Sen & Baltimore , 1986a , Hromas & Van Ness , 1986 ) and negative regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression ( Scholer & Gruss , 1985 ; Wall et al .
, 1986 ) has been described .
It Novel gene promoter region 329 has been shown that the promoter sequences may act independently of enhancer sequences in conferring tissue specificity from a heterologous promoter ( Doyen et al .
, 1986 ) .
It is apparent from the existing data that tissue- and stage-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes comes under the control of both general and gene-specific transcriptional factors .
It is , therefore , necessary to establish a functional significance of these various factors in models that simulate normal B-cell differentiation .
Human lymphoid neoplasia is ideal for such a study .
It is believed that these neoplasms represent clones of cells arrested at various stages of lymphocyte differentiation ( Lukes & Collins , 1974 ; Foon , Schroff & Gale , 1982 ; Godal & Funderud , 1982 ; Nilsson and Klein , 1982 , Mather et a/ .
, 1984 ) .
These different classes produce different types and different amounts of immunoglobulins ( Godal and Funderud , 1982 , Nilsson & Klein , 1982 ; Mather et al .
, 1984 ; Kelley & Perry , 1986 ) .
We have chosen this model of human lymphoid neoplasia to study the functional significance and to characterize the immunoglobulin gene-specific transcription factors .
We have employed an in vitro cell-free transcription assay to test the nuclear extracts from human lymphoid neoplasms for the presence of functionally significant immunoglobulin gene-specific transacting factors ( Kossakowska et al .
, 1988 ) .
Nuclear extracts from various lymphoid and non-lymphoid cell lines , as well as from fresh specimens of human lymphomas and carcinomas were preincubated with V , gene , and specific enhancement of transcription was only obtained with the use of nuclear extracts from neoplastic lymphoid B cells that produce large amounts of immunoglobulins and correspond to late stages of B-cell differentiation ( Kossakowska et al .
, 1988 ) .
In the present study we have tested different subclones of the same V , gene with the use of in vitro transcription and DNA mobility shift assay in order to localize the DNA region ( s ) responsible for the action of the previously described transacting factor ( s ) ( Kossakowska et al .
, 1988 ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and fresh specimens All lymphoid cell lines were grown in suspension culture in MEM a-medium , supplemented with 20 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) .
$ 3a HeLa cells were grown in suspension culture in MEM a-medium supplemented with 10 % FCS .
Surgical specimens were obtained in the Department of Pathology and processed immediately .
Nuclear extracts Nuclear extracts from cultured cells and from single cell suspensions , obtained from fresh surgical specimens , were prepared according to the methodology described by Bazett-Jones , Yeckel & Gottesfeld ( 1985 ) .
These extracts were ali-quoted and kept frozen at -70° .
DNA templates HK101/3 clone was kindly provided by Dr D. L. Bentley ( Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle ) ( Bentley , Farrell & Rabbits , 1982 ) , and the HK 101/80 clone represents a 558 bp Pst 1 fragment subcloned in pTZ-19R ( Pharmacia ) plasmid ( Fig .
1 ) .
These templates were used for in vitro run-off transcription assay after digestion with appropriate restriction endonucleases ; 920 bp , 558 bp , and 90 bp Pst 1 restriction fragments of HK101/3 were isolated from low melting agarose , end-labelled and used for DNA mobility shift assay .
In vitro transcription assay The in vitro transcription assay with the use of whole cell HeLa extracts was performed according to Manley et al .
( 1980 ) .
The reactions were performed in 50 ul volumes , containing 30 ul of HeLa whole cell extract , 5 ul of nucleoside triphosphates containing 5 mm ATP , CTP , UTP , 1 mm GTP with 10 uCi of [ a- ( *P ) GTP ] ( New Research Products ) , and 0-2-0-5 ug of template DNA .
Nuclear extracts or control buffer in the amount of 2 ul per reaction were preincubated with the DNA template for 10 min at room temperature before initiation of transcription .
The amount of nuclear extract was measured in cell equivalents and the products of transcription were electrophoresed in 14 % agarose gels after denaturation with glyoxol .
DNA mobility shift assay The DNA mobility shift assay was performed according to the methodology described by Landolfi et al .
, ( 1986 ) .
The `` P-labelled fragments were incubated with the control buffer or nuclear extracts for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of 10 ug of sheared salmon sperm DNA ( Pharmacia ) and in some experiments with 1-8 ng of unlabelled fragments of HK101/3 ; 1-4 ng of P-labelied fragments and 4x 10° cell equivalents of nuclear extracts were used .
The binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 ul .
The samples were electrophoresed in 1-4 % agarose gels containing 0-2 m Tris ( pH 8-3 ) , 0-1 m boric acid and 0-2 mm EDTA .
These were run for 3-4 hr at 10V /cm .
All gels were dried and autoradiographed .
RESULTS Enhancement of in vitro transcription of different fragments of human V , gene in the presence of nuclear extracts from human lymphoid neoplasms We have used fragments of variable region of human unrearranged V , gene ( clones HK101/3 and HK101/80 ) for the in vitro run-off transcription assay .
The HK 101/3 clone represents a 4-9 kb fragment containing 2-9 kb of the 5 ' flanking region and 1:5 kb of 3 ' flanking region ( Bentley et al .
, 1982 ) .
This gene is subcloned in the HindIII , EcoR1 site of pBR-322 and a restriction map of this clone is presented in the top of Fig .
1 .
In the run-off transcription assay , when HK 101/3 is linearized with HindIII alone it gives rise to 2 kb transcript .
The transcript starts at the cap site and ends at the HindIII site ( Fig .
1 ) .
The same length of transcript is obtained when the HK101/3 is digested with both BamHI and HindIII , since the 5 flanking region sequences from BamHI site to cap site are not transcribed in our assay ( Fig .
1b and c ) ( Kossakowska et al .
, 1988 ) .
The HK101/80 represents a subclone of HK101/3 .
It is a 558 bp , Pst 1 fragment , which contains 130 bp of 5 flanking region and 428 bp of the V , coding region .
It gave rise to a 440 bp transcript ( Fig .
1a , b and c ) , ( Bentley et a/ .
, 1982 ) .
The pBR-322 and pTZ-19R vector sequences were not separated from the template sequences and were present in transcription reactions .
As described previously , transcription of the HK101/3 clone was enhanced 10-22-fold when this template was preincubated with nuclear extracts derived from human large non-cleaved 330 A. E.

In lane ( i ) the template was preincubated with control buffer , in lane ( ii ) with 4x 10° cell equivalents of nuclear extract from human plasmacytoma ( IgA 4 cell line ) and in lane ( iii ) with 4 x 10° cell equivalents of nuclear extract derived from large non-cleaved cell lymphoma ( OCI1-LY 1 cell line ) .

Vector DNA sequences ( pBR-322 and pTZ-19R ) were not removed from the reactions .
In lane ( i ) the templates were preincubated with control buffer , in lane ( ii ) with 4 x 10° cell equivalents of nuclear extract form human plasmacytoma ( IgA 2 cell line ) and in lane ( iii ) with 4 x 10° cell equivalents of nuclear extract derived from large non-cleaved cell lymphoma ( OCI1-LY1 cell line ) .
HK101/3 digested with HindIII , BamHI gave rise to a 2000 bp transcript and HK 101/80 digested with Pstl to a 440 bp transcript .

cell , small non-cleaved cell ( Burkitt 's ) lymphomas and plasmacytomas ( Kossakowska ert al .
, 1988 ) .
These results were obtained when the template was linearized with HindIII .
Digestion of the template with BamH1 in addition to HindIII did not diminish the enhancing effects of the nuclear extracts tested .
These data indicated that the DNA region responsible for the action of the enhancing transacting factors is located within 1150 bp upstream of the cap site ( Fig .
1 ) .
To further localize the regulatory sequences responsible for the in vitro transcription enhancement of HK101/3 , we have used the HKIO1/80 subclone , which contains the V , coding region , and 130 bp of the upstream 5 ' flanking sequences ( Fig .
1 ) .
It has been shown previously that this region is sufficient for accurate initiation of transcription and contains the 'octamer ' sequence that has been implicated in tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes ( Bentley et al .
, 1982 ; Falkner & Zachau , 1984 ; Staudt et al .
, 1986 ) .
The in vitro transcription of this subclone was not enhanced by any of the nuclear extracts used .
In Fig .
la , lane ( i ) represents a control reaction in which the HK101/80 clone was preincubated with control buffer .
In lane ( ii ) the template was preincubated with nuclear extract from human plasmacytoma and in lane ( iii ) with nuclear extract from large non-cleaved cell lymphoma .
No differences in levels of transcription were seen .
The concentration of the nuclear extracts used was 4 x 10° cell equivalents and the DNA concentration was 0-2 ug per reaction ( the optimum established previously ; Kossakowska et al .
, 1988 ) .
When the HK 101/80 was premixed with HK101/3 ( Fig .
1b and c ) and preincubated with nuclear extracts from human plasmacytoma ( lane ii ) or large non-cleaved cell lymphoma ( lane iii ) ( Fig .
1b ) , the enhancement of HK 101/3 was 10-fold when measured by comparing the ratio between the intensity of the two bands .
Measured separately the HK101/3 enhancement was 10-fold in both lanes , and that of HK101/80 1-15- in lane ( ii ) and 1:02-fold in lane ( iii ) .
The slight increase of the HK 101/80 transcription does not appear significant and may be related to the pipetting error .
Preincubation of HK101/80 with different amounts of nuclear extract from human plasmacytoma did not remove the enhancing activity for HK101/3 ( Fig .
1c ) .
The enhancement of HK101/3 was 10-fold over the control , while the transcription of HK101/80 showed Novel !
gene promoter region only a slight increase which is probably related to the increased background radioactivity .
In previously published data ( Kossakowska et al .
, 1988 ) the levels of transcription from HK101/3 were compared with the levels of transcription from the Adenovirus II major late promoter ( AdII ) .
The Ad II transcript has a similar length ( 442 bp ) to that of HK 101/80 ( 440 bp ) and similar enhancement of HK101/3 ( 10-12-fold ) was observed in the mixtures of both templates .
HK101/3 gene , 0-2 ug , transcribed without nuclear extracts gave rise to approximately 0-002 transcripts/gene/hr ( Kossakowska et al .
, 1988 ) .
The transcription of HK 101/80 was 40 times more efficient and when 0-2 ug of this template was transcribed without nuclear extracts ( Fig .
1a , b and c ) approximately 0-08 transcripts/gene/hr were obtained .
These differences are not well understood at the present time .
It has , however , been described previously that the larger size fragments of the V ; , promoter are less efficient than the shorter ones in the in vivo transcription assays ( Doyen et al .
, 1986 ) .
From the present data it is apparent that the sequences responsible for the in vitro enhancing effects of the nuclear extracts derived from human B-cell neoplasms are not located within the 130 bp of 5 ' flanking region of the HK 101/80 clone .
Instead they appear to be localized upstream of the HK 101/80 .
Binding of nuclear proteins from human lymphoid neoplasms to specific upstream sequences of human V , gene We have analysed three fragments of the HK 101/3 gene with the use of a DNA mobility shift assay utilizing nuclear extracts derived from human lymphoid and non-lymphoid neoplasms .
These fragments are schematically presented in the top of Fig .
2 .
The 558 bp fragment corresponding to HK 101/80 clone gave rise to three distinct shift bands when preincubated with nuclear extract derived from human plasmacytoma ( IgA 4 cell line ) , large non-cleaved cell lymphoma ( OCI1-LY1 cell line ) , small non-cleaved cell lymphoma ( Raji cell line ) and HeLa cells ( Fig .
2a , lanes ii-v , respectively ) , giving rise to an identical shift pattern with all the extracts used .
Other nuclear extracts tested included : two plasmacytomas ( fresh specimen and cell line ) , two fresh specimens of small cleaved cell lymphomas , pre B-cell leukaemia , three cell lines of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukae-mias , K562 cell line of chronic myelogenous leukaemia and fresh specimen of human breast carcinoma .
The amount of nuclear extracts used was 4 x 10° cell equivalents , as it was found to be an optimum for all the extracts used in this assay ( data not shown ) .
Different amounts of DNA used in the shift assay gave rise to the same shift band pattern with the use of nuclear extract derived from human plasmacytoma ( Fig .
2b ) .
The 90 bp fragment located directly upstream of HK 101/80 clone was not shifted with any of the nuclear extracts used ( Fig .
2c ) .
The only fragment which gave rise to specific band shift was the 920 bp , Pst 1 fragment corresponding to HK101/2 clone described by Bentley & Rabbits ( 1981 ) , ( Fig .
2d ) .
This fragment is located 210 bp from the cap site ( Fig .
1 ) .
When preincubated with nuclear extract ( 4x 10° cell equivalents ) derived from human plasmacytoma it gave rise to a distinct band shift ( Fig .
2d , lane ii ) .
When this fragment was preincubated with 4 x 10° cell equivalents of nuclear extracts derived from HeLa cells ( lane iii ) , large non-cleaved cell ( lane iv ) and small non-cleaved cell lymphomas ( Burkitt 's , lane v ) , no detectable shift was noted 331 HK 10 1/80 HK 10 1/2 A A EcoRI gone ... d | I HindIHI PstI Pst I1 Pst I l Pst L BomHL P ; I 4 1 } i `` VFW ] 558 bp | 920 bp LJ 90 bp ( a ) ( i ) ( ii ) ( iii ) ( iv ) ( v ) ( b ) ( i ) ( ii ) ( iii ) ( iv ) # k—ssebp— ﬁnd- “ w ( e ) ( i ) ( ii ) ( iii ) ( iv ) ( a ) ( i ) _ ( ii ) ( ii ) ( iv ) ( v ) « me « ane « anh eB -90 1 ; Figure 2 .

4x 10° cell equivalents of the nuclear extract derived from human plamacytoma ( IgA 4 cell line ) was preincubated with 8 , 4 , 2 and 1 ng of non-labelled HK101/3 clone ( lanes i-iv , respectively ) .

In lane ( iv ) only the labelled fragment was preincubated with 4 x 10° cell equivalents of the nuclear extract derived from IgA 2 cell line .
Preincubation with different concentrations of non-labelled HK101/3 DNA abolished the ability of nuclear extracts from human plasmacytomas to shift the fragment corresponding to HK 101/2 clone ( Fig 3a ) , but preincubation with HK 101/80 did not show such a specific activity ( Fig .
3b ) .
DISCUSSION It is known that the production of immunoglobulins increases during B-cell differentiation ( Lamson & Koshland , 1984 ) .
We were able to show in our model that immunoglobulin gene-specific transcription factor ( s ) plays a role in this increase of the immunoglobulin gene expression by human lymphoid neoplasms ( Kossakowska er a/ .
, 1988 ) .
With the use of similar methods it had been shown that the hemin-induced production of haemoglobin in K 562 cells is also dependent on the presence of B-globin family gene-specific transacting factor ( s ) ( Bazett-Jones et al .
, 1985 ) .
Similar mechanisms controlling the tissue and differentiation stage-specific expression of eukaryotic genes may , therefore , operate for different classes of these genes .
Our results are in agreement with previously published data suggesting that different controlling mechanisms may operate at different stages of B-cell differentiation ( Sen & Baltimore , 1986a ; Hromas & Van Ness , 1986 ) .
Most of the previous studies concentrated on the immunoglobulin enhancer-binding protein NF-xB ( Sen & Baltimore , 1986a ; Atchinson & Perry , 1987 ) .
In our study we have used only promoter sequences of human unrearranged V , gene , which is transcriptionally 'silent ' in vivo .
It has been shown previously by an in vitro assay that this gene contains a functional promoter and can be efficiently transcribed in vitro with the use of whole cell HeLa extracts ( Bentley et al .
, 1982 ; Kossakowska et al .
, 1988 ) .
Both HK101/3 and HK 101/80 clones contain functional promoters and it is known that the sequences between -90 and -160 base pairs upstream of the coding region are essential for correct transcriptional initiation ( Falkner & Zachau , 1984 ) .
However , the sequences further upstream of this region may be necessary for tissue- and stage-specific expression of these genes ( Pospelov et al .
, 1984 ) .
The HK101/3 gene containing 29 kb of these sequences was chosen for the initial experiments ( Kossakowska et al .
, 1988 ) .
The in vitro transcription of the HK101/80 clone containing only 130 bp of the 5 ' flanking region was more efficient in our in vitro assay but its transcription was not enhanced by any of the B-cell nuclear extracts used .
These results may be related to the higher base line transcription levels of this clone , but it is also likely that the region responsible for the enhancement of in vitro transcription of the V , gene is located further upstream from the cap site .
This hypothesis is further supported by the results of the DNA mobility shift assay .
The 558 bp HK101/80 clone , which contains 130 bp of sequences within the 5 flanking promoter region and was not enhanced by any of the B-cell nuclear extracts used , gave rise to a non-specific mobility shift pattern as observed with the DNA binding assay .
With the use of this assay we have observed three distinct shift bands similar to those described previously ( Staudt er al .
, 1986 ) .
Recently published data indicate that the complexity and multiplicity of the observed shift bands may be related to limited proteolytic cleavage of the factor ( s ) during nuclear extract preparation ( Mather , 1988 ) .
It has been suggested that stage-specific differences in the expression of transacting factor ( s ) during B-cell differentiation are related to the increase in the activity of proteases in more differentiated B-cell tumours ( e.g .
plasmacytomas ) and after mitogen stimulation .
However , we did not see any difference in the patterns of DNA-protein complex mobility with the use of lymphoid and non-lymphoid nuclear extracts .
No differences were observed with the use of nuclear extracts derived from B-cell neoplasms corresponding to different stages of B-cell maturation .
This discrepancy is not well understood but may be related to the differences in the preparation of nuclear extracts .
We have used the methodology described by Bazett-Jones et al ( 1985 ) while the others have used the method of Dignam , Lebovitz & Roeder ( 1983 ) or methods described recently by Mather ( 1988 ) .
Different protein factor ( s ) may be isolated with the use of these different methods .
Furthermore , our extracts ( nuclear extracts prepared at the same time were used in both Novel gene promoter region 333 assays ) had not only shown the binding affinity for specific DNA sequences , but were also active in the functional in vitro transcription assay .
Therefore , even if they were partially degraded by the proteases , at least some biologically active factor ( s ) was present in our extracts .
The HK1O01/80 contains the octamer sequence ( Fig .
1 ) which has been implicated in tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes ( Staudt et al .
, 1986 ; Landolfi et al .
, 1986 ) .
It has , however , been shown previously that the factors binding in this region are found in T cells and cells of non-lymphoid origin in addition to B cells ( Wang et al .
, 1987 ) .
As in our study , the complex pattern of shift bands observed by Landolfi et al .
( 1986 ) , which was thought to be cell-type or stage-specific may , in fact , result from the action of proteases present in nuclear extract preparations ( Mather , 1988 ) .
In our mobility shift assay the only nuclear extracts which were active in causing the mobility shift of HK101/2 were these derived from the human plasmacytomas .
None of the other extracts ( including the large non-cleaved cell and Burkitt 's lymphomas ) , which caused the enhancement of in vitro transcription of HK1i01/3 clone , produced any shift of HK101/2 mobility .
This may be related to the concentration of transacting protein factor ( s ) in different nuclear extracts , their degradation during the nuclear extract preparation , to the size of the fragment used for the DNA mobility shift assay and to the fact that we have used agarose instead of polyacrylamide gels .
It is of notice that only a slight shift is observed in our assay .
This , however , is not surprising in view of the size of the fragment used ( 920 bp ) .
Sequencing and subdividing of this fragment may lead to the discovery of novel DNA sequences as well as novel protein factor ( s ) , which control the transcription of immunoglobulin genes in human lymphoid neoplasia .
