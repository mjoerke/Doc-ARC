10 Cell-Specific Differences in Activation of NF- « B Regulatory Elements of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Beta Interferon Promoters by Tumor Necrosis Factor J. LACOSTE , M. D'ADDARIO , A. ROULSTON , M. A. WAINBERG , anp J. HISCOTT* Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research-Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital , Department of Microbiology and Immunology and McGill AIDS Centre , McGill University , Montreal , Quebec , Canada H3T 1E2 Received 8 March 1990/Accepted 11 June 1990 Three aspects of the involvement of tumor necrosis factor in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) pathogenesis were examined .
Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) mRNA production was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification in monocytic U937 cells and in a chronically HIV infected U937 cell line ( U9-IIIB ) .
TNF-a RNA was undetectable in U937 cells , whereas a low constitutive level was detected in U9-IIIB cells .
Paramyxovirus infection induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in the steady-state level of TNF-a RNA in U9-IIIB cells compared with U937 cells , suggesting that HIV-infected monocytic cells produced higher levels of TNF-a than did normal cells after a secondary virus infection .
The effects of TNF-a on gene expression were examined by transient expression assays using reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids linked to regulatory elements from the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and the beta interferon promoter .
In U937 and Jurkat T lymphoid cells , the inducibility of the different hybrid promoters by TNF-a or phorbol ester varied in a cell type- and promoter context-specific manner ; the levels of gene activity of NF- « B-containing plasmids correlated directly with induction of NF-xB DNA-binding activity .
Although the intact beta interferon promoter was only weakly stimulated by phorbol ester or TNF- « , multimers of the PRDII NF-B-binding domain were inducible by both agents .
TNF- « was able to increase expression of the HIV LTR in T cells , but in monocytic cells , TNF-a « did not induce the HIV LTR above a constitutive level of activity .
This level of NF- « B-independent activity appears to be sufficient for virus multiplication , since TNF-a treatment had no effect on the kinetics of de novo HIV type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and viral RNA production in U937 cells .
However , in Jurkat cells , TNF-a dramatically enhanced the spread of HIV-1 through the cell population and increased viral RNA synthesis , indicating that in T cells HIV-1 multiplication was stimulated by TNF-a treatment .
A critical component of nonadaptive immunity is the release of soluble mediators that affect diverse biological processes such as immune responsiveness , differentiation , and cell proliferation .
In response to foreign antigens , cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage produce a variety of peptide hormones or cytokines that bind to their cognate receptors on target cells and transduce signals to the nucleus ( 47 ) .
Often the consequence of signal transduction is the modulation of gene expression , mediated by changes in the activity or amount of specific transcription factors ( 39 ) .
Many viruses target infection to myeloid cells , resulting in compromise of monocyte/macrophage function .
Dysregulation of the mechanisms that control cytokine production in myeloid cells may have deleterious consequences on immune responsiveness , inflammation , and viral pathogenesis .
Peripheral blood monocytes , tissue macrophages , and bone marrow-derived immature myeloblasts express the CD4 cell surface antigen , the cellular receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) ( 8 , 30 ) , and , like T helper lymphocytes , are subject to HIV-1 infection at high frequency ( 1 , 3 , 13 , 17-19 , 26 , 35 , 45 ) .
These cells generally do not show extensive cytopathology and thus may serve as reservoirs for viral persistence and spread to peripheral tissues ( 11 , 46 ) .
The distinction between a lytic versus more latent state of HIV infection is regulated by the complex interplay between HIV regulatory proteins , host cellular proteins , cis-acting DNA sequences within the HIV long * Corresponding author .
4726 terminal repeat ( LTR ) , and antigenic stimulation of HIV-infected cells ( reviewed in reference 7 ) .
HIV pathogenesis may also be influenced by the secretion of cytokines that influence HIV multiplication ( 6 , 11 , 12 , 38 ) .
For example , monocyte-derived cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF- « ) and interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) have been shown recently to stimulate HIV-1 transcription via activation of the transcription factor NF- « B , which binds to two recognition sequences within the HIV-1 transcriptional enhancer ( 9 , 28 , 41 , 43 , 44 ) .
NF- « B may be stimulated by multiple activation mechanisms , including coinfection with other viruses , differentiation-inducing agents , and antigenic stimulation ( reviewed in reference 33 ) .
It is now recognized that NF- « B is a pleiotropic mediator of gene regulation involved in the transcriptional activation of several immunoregulatory genes , cytokines , and viral promoters ( 33 ) .
NF-kB exists in the cytoplasm in a latent form as a p6S-p50 heterodimer coupled to an inhibitor molecule termed IxB ; activation is a posttranslational event that involves dissociation from IxB and nuclear translocation of the DNA-binding activity ( 2 , 53 ) .
In this study , the involvement of TNF-a in HIV pathogenesis was examined in monocytic and T lymphoid cells .
TNF- « mRNA production was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification in monocytic U937 cells and in a chronically HIV infected U937-derived cell line after coinfection with Sendai virus .
The effects of TNF-a or phorbol ester treatment on protein-DNA interactions and expression of plasmids containing HIV LTR and beta interferon ( IFN-B ) regulatory elements were measured Vor .

Also , the effects of TNF-a on the kinetics of HIV-1 multiplication and viral RNA accumulation were monitored during de novo infection of U937 and Jurkat cells .
The experimental results suggest that in T cells , HIV-1 gene activity and multiplication were dependent on the induction of NF- « B binding ; in monocytic cells , although NF-kB activity was inducible by TNF-a and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) , it was not required for HIV LTR activity or HIV-1 replication .

Transient expression assays .
Jurkat cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method ( 23 ) , and U937 cells were transfected by electroporation , using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser ( 0.25 kV , 960 wF ) ( 25 ) .
Briefly , 3 x 10 `` cells were transfected with 15 ug of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmids , and at 24 h after transfection they were treated with PMA ( 25 ng/m ! )
or with TNF-a ( 100 U/ml ; Genzyme ) .
At 20 h after induction , cells were harvested and assayed for accumulated CAT activity .
Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay .
Protein ( 10 to 30 pg ) was assayed for 15 min to 3 h. Percent acetylation was determined , and the relative inducibility was obtained by dividing percent conversion of treated versus untreated samples .
WCE preparations .
Whole-cell extracts ( WCE ) were prepared from U937 and Jurkat cells ( 10° cells per ml ) after induction for 8 h with PMA ( 25 ng/ml ) or TNF- « ( 100 U/ml ) .
Cells were collected by centrifugation , washed once with 1 volume of cold phosphate-buffered saline , and suspended in WCE buffer ( 20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ] , 0.5 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM EGTA , 0.5 mM spermidine , 0.15 mM spermine , 10 % glyc-erol , 10 mM sodium molybdate , and 1 mM dithiothreitol ) containing 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 pug each of pepstatin , aprotonin , and leupeptin per ml as prote-ase inhibitors .
Cells were lysed by slowly adding 2 M KCl to a final concentration of 0.5 M. Lysates were gently mixed for 30 min at 4°C , and cellular debris was removed by centrifu-gation ( 30,000 rpm , 90 min , 2°C ) .
Supernatants were then diluted to 0.1 M KCl by adding WCE buffer ( 15 ) .
Final protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay .
Gel retardation assays .
A 10- to 15-ug sample of crude WCE protein , in WCE buffer ( 0.1 M KCI ) , was preincubated with 5 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) as nonspecific competitor DNA for 10 min on ice .
y-*P-labeled HIV enhancer probe ( 0.2 ng ) was incubated with WCE for 20 to 30 min at room temper-ature .
Competition assays were performed by incubating a 125-fold excess of unlabeled competitor ( 25 ng ) with the WCE for 10 min on ice before the addition of radiolabeled probe .
Samples were analyzed on native 5 % acrylamide gels and run at 80 V for 1.5 to 2.5 h. Gels were dried and autoradiographed for about 15 h. Oligonucleotides were 5 ' end labeled with [ y- > P ] ATP ( 3,888 Ci/mmol ; ICN Radio-chemicals ) and polynucleotide kinase ( Pharmacia ) and subsequently applied to Sephadex G-50 column to remove unincorporated nucleotides .

Effects of PMA and TNF-a induction on various hybrid promoters in U937 cells .
The cells were transfected , by electroporation , with each of the constructs depicted in Fig .

The transfected cells were induced with PMA ( 25 ng/ml ) or TNF-a ( 100 U/ml ! )
at 20 h after transfection and harvested 24 h after induction .
Cell lysates were then prepared for CAT assays .
Lysates ( 30 ug ) from cells transfected with constructs HIV/CAT , SV2CAT , SV 5g , P1 ( 3 ) / CAT , and P5 ( 4 ) /CAT were assayed for 3 h. Lysates ( 20 pug ) from cells transfected with constructs HIV/CAT ( +TAT ) , P2 ( 2 ) /CAT , and « B ( 3 ) /CAT were assayed for 15 min .

produced in U937 cells and chronically HIV infected U9-HIB cells , both before and after coinfection with the Sendai paramyxovirus .
Untreated U937 cells did not spontaneously express significant amounts of TNF-a mRNA ( Fig .
1B , lane 1 ) , whereas chronically HIV infected U9-IIIB cells constitu-tively produced a low level of TNF RNA ( Fig .
1B , lane 3 ) .
Sendai virus infection of both cell types increased the steady-state levels of TNF-a mRNA ( Fig .
1B , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
In multiple experiments , the induced U9-IIIB cells produced 5 to 10 times more TNF- « mRNA than did Sendai virus-infected U937 cells ( Fig .
1C ) , suggesting that TNF-a gene expression was more inducible in cells .
Primers to the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) gene were used as an internal constitutive RNA control ( Fig .
1B , lanes 5 to 8 ) ; these reactions were carried out separately , since GAPDH amplification interfered with the TNF amplification ( data not shown ) .
In addition , a constant amount of SV2CAT DNA ( 107° pg ) was added to the reaction and coamplified with TNF as an external standard for quantifi-cation ( Fig .
1C ) ; no interference with the TNF amplification was observed with the SV2CAT control .
When reverse transcriptase was excluded from the reaction , no PCR-amplified TNF-a signals were observed ( Fig .
1B , lanes 9 to 12 ) , demonstrating the specificity of the procedure .
This pattern of enhanced cytokine gene transcription was also observed with other monocyte-derived cytokines such as IL-1 and IFN-B in HIV-infected cells ( M. D'Addario , A. Roulston , M. A. Wainberg , and J. Hiscott , submitted for publication ) .
Effects of PMA and TNF-a on hybrid promoter activity .

SV2CAT contains the entire SV40 early promoter-enhancer linked to the CAT reporter gene ( 13 ) ; the HIV/ CAT plasmid encompasses the complete HIV LTR ( -350 to +80 , corresponding to the U3 and R regions ) ( 24 ) ; and SV 5B contains the entire IFN-B promoter ( -287 to +19 ) , linked with the SV40 enhancer for increased activity ( 51 ) .
The enhancerless SVICAT parental vector was used to generate the kB ( 3 ) plasmid containing three copies of the HIV enhancer element ( -105 to -80 ) ( 24 ) .
Different regulatory domains of the IFN-B promoter involved in virus inducibility were also subcloned into SVICAT to generate plasmids containing three copies of P1 ( -79 to -65 ) , four copies of P5 ( -94 to ~78 ) , and two copies of P2 ( =-64 to =55 ) , which represents the NF-kB recognition site in the IFN-B promoter ( 14 , 24 , 34 , 48 ) .
These IFN hybrid regulatory regions are differentially activated in response to virus induction ( 10 , 31 ) .
The effects of TNF- « and phorbol ester on hybrid promoter activity were examined by transient expression in monocytic U937 and T lymphocytic Jurkat cells .
In monocytic U937 cells ( Fig .
3 ) , phorbol ester increased SV2CAT activity about 16-fold , mediated by the TC-II ( NF- « B ) region of the SV40 enhancer and other PMA-inducible elements ( 36 ) , whereas TNF-a did not significantly induce the SV40 enhancer-promoter above the basal level of activity .
The SVICAT parental vector was not induced by either PMA or TNF-a , demonstrating the enhancer dependence of induction .
The entire HIV LTR was induced about fivefold by PMA but was not significantly activated by TNF-a .

fection with an expression plasmid encoding rat-1 increased activity of the HIV LTR more than 100-fold , beyond the linear range of the assay shown .
When the HIV enhancer alone was analyzed in plasmid kB ( 3 ) , TNF- « increased promoter activity 8-fold , compared with a 29-fold induction with PMA .
Several significant differences were observed when the effects of TNF-a and PMA were examined on the inducible IFN-B promoter .
The IFN-B promoter was not responsive to either treatment ( data not shown ) , and even the presence of the SV40 enhancer linked to the IFN-B promoter only moderately increased gene activity after PMA induction ( Fig .
3 ) .
This observation supports previous observations that the IFN-B promoter contains negative regulatory elements capable of silencing the activity of the SV40 enhancer ( 15 , 21 , 51 , 54 ) .
Individual IFN-B domains were also examined ; plasmids containing the P1 and P5 regions were not induced by PMA or TNF-a « , reflecting the virus-inducible specificity of these regions ( 10 , 16 , 31 ) .
However , the P2 ( 2 ) CAT plasmid was induced 26- and 7-fold by PMA and TNF-a , respectively ; these effects were virtually identical to the results observed with kB ( 3 ) .
These experiments confirm that the « B-contain-ing elements of the HIV enhancer and the IFN-B promoter are equivalent regulatory elements when analyzed individually ( 14 , 24 , 34 , 48 ) and in U937 cells are differentially induced by phorbol esters and TNF- « .
Despite the inducibility of these domains , activities of the HIV LTR and the IFN-B promoter were not increased above a basal level of activity by TNF-a treatment .
The same constructs were analyzed in Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
In this cellular background , a major difference in promoter activity was observed ; P2 ( 2 ) and kB ( 3 ) plasmids were strongly induced ( up to 100-fold ) by PMA and TNF-a treatments .
Most importantly , activity of the intact HIV LTR was also induced about 20-fold by TNF-a treatment , although PMA induction was still about 4-fold higher .

Induction of NF-B binding by PMA and TNF- « .
WCE were prepared from untreated or treated U937 and Jurkat cells to examine protein-DNA interactions within the HIV enhancer ( Fig .

The induced complexes were competed for by an excess of unlabeled homologous HIV enhancer sequence and by the P2 oligonucleotide ( Fig .

When Jurkat extracts were analyzed , identical inducible complexes were also formed after PMA and TNF- « treatments , with the significant difference that TNF-a was as potent an inducer of complex formation in T cells as was phorbol ester ( Fig .
5B , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
Competition assays again demonstrated that complex formation was dependent on intact NF- « B sites within the HIV enhancer ( Fig .
5B , lanes 10 to 12 ) .
To further confirm that the HIV enhancer and the P2 domain interacted with the same NF-kB proteins ( Fig .
5B , lanes 4 to 9 ) , the DNA-binding studies were repeated with use of a P2 oligonucleotide probe , and results identical to those presented in Fig .
5 were obtained ( data not shown ) .
These studies demonstrated a coordinate activation of NF-kB DNA-binding activity and transcriptional induction of < B-containing plasmids in monocytic and T lymphoid cells .
Stimulation of HIV-1 multiplication in T cells by TNF-a .
Despite the correlation between NF-kB DNA-binding activity and induction of < B-containing plasmids by PMA and TNF-a , the previous results also demonstrated that in U937 cells , the HIV LTR was not significantly activated above the basal level of activity by TNF-a .
To directly examine the effect of TNF-a on the kinetics of de novo HIV-1 infection , U937 and Jurkat cells were infected in the presence of TNF-a .
Spread of HIV-1 through U937 cells , as determined by p24 antigen immunofluorescence , was not affected by TNF-a treatment ( Fig .
6A ) .
When viral RNA was measured by Northern blot analysis , no difference in the accumulation of intracellular viral RNA was observed between untreated and TNF-a « -treated U937 cells during days 2 to 10 p.i .
( Fig .
6C , lanes 1 to 8 ) .
Significant cytopathology was not observed in HIV-l-infected U937 cells ( J. Lacoste , unpublished ob-servations ) .
In contrast , TNF-a dramatically stimulated the kinetics of de novo HIV-1 infection ( Fig .
6B ) and viral RNA production ( Fig .
6C , lanes 9 to 18 ) in Jurkat T cells .
In TNF- « -treated Jurkat cells , viral RNA accumulated rapidly and was easily detectable at 4 days p.i .
, whereas viral RNA was not detected in untreated HIV-l-infected Jurkat cells until 8 days p.i .
( Fig .
6C ; compare lanes 10 and 13 ) .
Lytic destruction of the TNF- « -treated , HIV-l-infected Jurkat cells occurred between 8 and 10 days p.i .
and probably accounts for the degradation of viral RNA ( Fig .
6C , lane 16 ) .
In untreated cells , cell lysis was observed at 14 to 16 days p.i .
( Fig .
6C , lane 18 ) .
Thus , TNF-a treatment of Jurkat cells accelerated viral RNA synthesis and lytic destruction of the cell population , whereas no TNF-a effect was observed in U937 cells with respect to either viral RNA production or cell death .
DISCUSSION This study has characterized three important aspects of the interactions between the cytokine TNF-a and HIV pathogenesis .
We have observed that HIV-infected monocytic U9-IIIB cells can be superinduced for TNF- « mRNA production by a secondary virus infection .
Sendai virus infection was chosen as an inducing agent since its cytokine-activating potential has been characterized previously in the parental U937 cells ( 24 ) .
TNF-a RNA was produced at a low 4732 LACOSTE ET AL .

Effect of TNF treatment on HIV-1 infection of U937 and Jurkat cells .
The number of p24 antigen-positive cells was measured in U937 ( A ) and Jurkat ( B ) cells by indirect immunofluorescence at different times after infection .
TNF-a ( 100 U/ml ! )
was added at 24 h p.i .
( @ ) .
C , Untreated cells .
( C ) Northern blot analysis of intracellular RNA .
Total RNA ( 20 ug ) from U937 cells ( lanes 1 to 8 ) or Jurkat cells ( lanes 9 to 18 ) was isolated from untreated ( u ) or TNF-treated ( T ) cells at different days after HIV-1 infection ( indicated above the gel ) .
The positions of 9.0- , 4.5- , and 2.0-kilobase ( kb ) viral RNA species are indicated .
Lanes 1 to 10 were exposed to film for 16 h and lanes 11 to 18 were exposed to film for 2 h to illustrate the patterns of viral RNA migration .
constitutive level in HIV-infected cells , but after secondary virus infection , U9-IIIB cells produced higher levels of TNF- « mRNA and secreted more TNF-a , as detected by radioimmunoassay , than did similarly induced U937 cells ( M. D'Addario et al .
, submitted ) .
Similarly , superinduction of transcript levels was observed with other cytokine genes after coinfection , suggesting that multiple cytokine regulatory pathways may be altered by chronic HIV infection .
Dysregulation of coordinately regulated cytokine pathways ( 20 , 38 ) will likely have direct effects on HIV provirus reactivation and viral pathogenesis , since certain cytokines ( TNF and IL-1 ) are stimulatory signals for HIV transcription ( 4 , 9 , 12 , 28 , 37 ) .
In support of these observations , sera from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) often have higher circulating TNF levels , and increased half-life of TNF- « mRNA has recently been observed in mononuclear cells from patients with AIDS ( 49 , 50 ) .
The effect of TNF- « on the HIV LTR and the IFN-B regulatory regions was investigated by transient expression assays in monocytic U937 and T lymphoid Jurkat cells .
These cells were transfected with reporter CAT plasmids linked to the promoter regions of the HIV LTR , the HIV enhancer , the IFN-B promoter , and distinct regulatory domains of the IFN-B enhancer .
As described previously , TNF-a is an effective inducer of regulatory elements containing NF-kB recognition sites ( 8 , 18 , 29 , 30 ) .
However , we demonstrate here that the relative inducibility of NF- « B-containing elements varies in a cell type- and promoter context-specific manner .
In U937 cells , phorbol ester was a more effective inducer of NF-kB DNA binding and gene activity than was TNF- « .
Hybrid promoter plasmids containing multimers of the PRDII domain of IFN-B [ p2 ( 2 ) ] or multiple copies of the HIV enhancer [ kB ( 3 ) ] were both induced by TNF-a and PMA , but the level of induction of CAT activity and DNA binding was about fivefold lower after TNF-a treatment .
When the intact HIV LTR and IFN-B promoters were compared , PMA but not TNF-a treatment induced the HIV LTR , whereas the IFN-B promoter was not significantly activated by either treatment .
Furthermore , the IFN-B promoter displayed a dominant repressive activity on a linked SV40 enhancer , since the Vor .
64 , 1990 intact SV40 enhancer in SV2CAT was strongly inducible by PMA and moderately inducible by TNF-a .
In contrast , TNF-a was a potent inducer of NF- « B DNA-binding activity and CAT activity in T lymphoid cells ; TNF-a treatment also induced the HIV LTR , although to a lower level than observed with PMA treatment .
In this cell type , a strong correlation between gene activity and induction of NF- « B DNA binding was also observed .
Also as in monocytic cells , the IFN-B promoter was completely inactive and silenced an otherwise highly inducible SV40 enhancer .
Interestingly , unique regions of the IFN-B promoter displayed distinct inducibility properties : the PRDII domain of the IFN-B promoter was induced by TNF- « and PMA , but the P1 and PS regions were not responsive .
Previous experiments showed that the IFN-B promoter was weakly inducible by TNF-a ( 29 ) , and the results presented here demonstrate that this effect is mediated by NF- « B binding to PRDIIL .
Finally , we sought to examine the consequences of TNF-a treatment on the kinetics of HIV multiplication in monocytic and T lymphoid cells .
Continual treatment of U937 cells with TNF-a during HIV infection had no influence , either inhib-itory or stimulatory , on the course of HIV transmission as measured by p24 antigen immunofluorescence and Northern blot analysis of HIV RNA accumulation .
This result suggests that a level of NF- « B-independent transcription from the HIV LTR is sufficient for virus multiplication and is consistent with the demonstration that the NF- « B-binding sites in the HIV LTR may not be absolutely required for virus infectivity ( 32 ) .
In T cells , on the other hand , TNF- « produced a dramatic increase in multiplication and spread of HIV through the culture , culminating in lytic destruction of the cell population by 8 days , as compared with 16 days for the untreated , HIV-infected Jurkat cells .
This dramatic alteration in the time course of HIV transmission in T cells correlates directly with the responsiveness of the HIV LTR and NF- « kB-containing plasmids to TNF-a observed in the transfection studies .
In vivo , HIV-infected monocytic cells may be primed in some manner by HIV infection such that subsequent antigenic stimulation of these cells leads to the production of TNF and other cytokines .
TNF-a may not significantly augment HIV replication in the myeloid cell reservoir ; however , T lymphoid cells , a primary target of HIV infection are highly sensitive to the T-cell-activating effects of TNF-a ( 27 , 37 , 52 ) , an effect mediated in part by activation of NF-KB ( 12 , 28 , 43 , 44 ) .
Continued secretion of TNF-a from activated , HIV-infected monocytic cells may contribute to viral pathogenesis by increasing the lytic spread of HIV-1 through a T-cell population .
