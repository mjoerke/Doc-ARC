In HeLa cells stably transfected with the HIV-1 tat gene ( HeLa-tat cells ) , expression of the Tat protein enhanced both TNF-induced activation of NF- « B and TNF-mediated cytotoxicity .
A similar potentiation of TNF effects was observed in Jurkat T cells and Hela cells treated with soluble Tat protein .
TNF-mediated activation of NF-xB and cytotoxicity involves the intracellular formation of reactive oxygen inter-mediates .
Therefore , Tat-mediated effects on the cellular redox state were analyzed .
In both T cells and HeLa cells HIV-1 Tat suppressed the expression of Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase ( Mn-SOD ) , a mitochondrial enzyme that is part of the cellular defense system against oxidative stress .
Thus , Mn-SOD RNA protein levels and activity were markedly reduced in the presence of Tat .
Decreased Mn-SOD expression was associated with decreased levels of glutathione and a lower ratio of reduced : oxidized glutathione .
A truncated Tat protein ( Tat ; _ ; ; ) , known to transactivate the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , no longer affected Mn-SOD expression , the cellular redox state or TNF-mediated cytotoxicity .
Thus , our experiments demonstrate that the C-terminal region of HIV-1 Tat is required to suppress Mn-SOD expression and to induce pro-oxidative conditions reflected by a drop in reduced glutathione ( GSH ) and the GSH : oxidized GSH ( GSSG ) ratio .
They further imply a distinct mechanism of Mn-SOD suppression as compared with HIV-1 LTR transactivation by Tat .
Taken together , our data suggest that Tat expressed in HIV-l-infected cells and Tat taken up by non-infected cells modulates TNF activity by altering the cellular redox state .
These findings may be relevant for HIV-1 replication and for T cell depletion in acquired immune deficiency syndrome .
Key words : cytotoxicity/Mn-SOD/NF-xB activation/Tat/ TNF 546 Introduction The Tat protein from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is essential for efficient HIV-1 gene expression .
Tat acts by binding to a transactivation response element ( TAR ) , an RNA stem-loop structure located close to the 5 ' end of HIV-1 transcripts ( Berkhout et al .
, 1989 ; Dingwall et al .
, 1989 ) .
Tat increases the rate of transcription ( for reviews see Sharp and Marciniak , 1989 ; Cullen , 1990 ) by either enhanced transcriptional initiation ( Hauber et al .
, 1987 ; Southgate and Green , 1991 ) or increased transcriptional elongation ( Laspia et al .
, 1990 ; Feinberg et al .
, 1991 ; for a review see Frankel , 1992 ) , or a combination of both processes .
Tat exhibits immuno-suppressive properties and inhibits antigen-induced T cell proliferation ( Viscidi et al .
, 1989 ; Meyaard et al .
, 1992 ) .
Furthermore , the expression of a number of cellular genes and proteins is influenced by HIV-1 Tat .
Thus , lymphotoxin , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin ( IL ) -2 and IL-6 genes ( Buonaguro et al .
, 1992 ; Scala et al .
, 1994 ; Westendorp et al .
, 1994 ) are transactivated by Tat , and collagen expression in glioblastoma cells is increased ( Taylor et al .
, 1992 ) .
However , Tat was also shown to suppress promoter activity of major histo-compatibility complex ( MHC ) class I genes ( Howeroft et al .
, 1993 ) , to decrease IL-2 receptor expression in Jurkat T cells ( Purvis et al .
, 1992 ) and to down-regulate TNF receptor surface expression in Raji B lymphoblastoid cells ( Poesik et al .
, 1992 ) .
Finally , HIV-1 Tat is secreted by HIV-1-infected cells and can be taken up rapidly by other cells ( Cullen , 1986 ; Frankel and Pabo , 1988 ; Marcuzzi et al .
, 1992 ; Westendorp et al .
, 1994 ) .
Thus , Tat can potentially influence cellular gene expression in infected and non-infected cells .
TNF was found to amplify HIV-1 expression in chronically infected T lymphocytes , monocyte cell lines and primary monocytes ( Folks et al .
, 1989 ; Mellors et al .
, 1991 ) .
It stimulates HIV-1 replication via activation of the transcription factor NF-KB , which binds to the < B enhancer motifs in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ; Duh et al .
, 1989 ; Osborn et al .
, 1989 ) .
In unstimulated cells , NF-xB is present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form complexed with its inhibitory subunit IxB ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1988 ) .
When cells are stimulated with TNF , IkB rapidly dissociates from the inactive complex .
This process involves the activation of certain protein kinases and proteases ( Henkel et al .
, 1993 ) and allows translocation of NF-xB into the nucleus and subsequent binding to its DNA motifs ( Baeuerle , 1991 ; for a review see Blank et al .
, 1992 ) .
It has been shown previously that activation of NF-KB in response to TNF and other agents is mediated by pro-oxidative conditions ( Schreck et al .
, 1991 ; Schulze-Osthoff et al .
, 1993 ) .
Thus , exogenous reducing agents , such © Oxford University Press as N-acetyl-cysteine and glutathione , suppressed TNF-induced activation of NF-KB ( Staal et al .
, 1990 ; Mihm et al .
, 1991 ) and HIV-1 expression in infected Molt-4 T leukemia cells ( Roederer et al .
, 1990 ) .
HIV-1 infection is associated with a substantial decrease in CD4+* T lymphocytes ( Meyaard et al .
, 1992 ) .
It has been proposed that CD4 * T cells are depleted by apoptosis ( Ameisen and Capron , 1991 ) .
According to one model , T cells are primed to undergo apoptosis upon crosslinking of CD4 by gp120 ( Banda et al .
, 1992 ; Gougeon and Montagnier , 1993 ) .
Subsequent activation by conventional antigens or superantigens induces apoptosis in these T cells ( Ameisen and Capron , 1991 ) .
Both TNF and lymphotoxin play a central role in the course of the HIV-1 infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
High levels of TNF have been observed in sera ( Zauli et al .
, 1992 ) and in supernatants of cultured monocytes ( Wright et al .
, 1988 ) , peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( Vyakarnam et a/ .
, 1991 ) and alveolar macrophages from AIDS patients ( Krishnan et al .
, 1990 ) .
It has also been reported that an abnormal cellular redox state contributes to apoptosis of CD4* T cells ( Dréoge et al .
, 1992 ) , and that TNF , by generating oxidative stress , may be one of the mediators causing lysis of HIV-1-infected CD4* T cells ( Huber et al .
, 1992 ) .
However , it is unclear what events render cells susceptible to the cytotoxic action of TNF during HIV-1 infection .
In this study we examined the ability of HIV-1 Tat protein to modulate TNF activity .
It was found that HIV-1 Tat potentiates TNF-induced NF- « xB activation and TNF-mediated cytotoxicity by down-regulation of Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase ( Mn-SOD ) , shifting the cellular redox state towards pro-oxidative conditions .
Thus HIV-1 Tat might provide the link between viral infection and the observed oxidative stress and consequent CD4+* T cell depletion in AIDS .
Results Expression of HIV-1 Tat potentiates TNF-induced activation of NF-xB and TNF-mediated cytotoxicity To explore the effects of endogenous tat expression on TNF-induced activation of NF-KB and TNF-mediated cytotoxicity , HeLa cells stably transfected with a tat expression vector were employed .
Expression of Tat protein was evident from a 1200-fold increase of HIV LTR-directed reporter gene expression in the transfected compared with the wild-type HeLa cells ( data not shown ) .
To monitor NF-KB activation , parental cells and HeLa-tat cells were exposed to TNF ( 10 ng/ml ) .
After 30 min , cells were lyzed and analyzed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) using an NF-KB-specific P-labeled oligonucleotide .
As shown in Figure 1 , constitutive and TNF-induced NF- « xB DNA binding was significantly elevated in HeLa-tat cells in comparison with parental cells .
Since NF-xB was reported previously to be inhibited by antioxidants ( Schreck et al .
, 1991 ; Schulze-Osthoff et al .
, 1993 ) , we further studied the effect of the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) on Tat-modulated NF-xB activation .
Parental cells pretreated with 500 uM BHA revealed a significant decrease of TNF-induced NF-KB DNA binding ( Figure 1A , lane 4 ) .

TNF-induced activation of NF-xB in HeLa-tat and parental cells .
( A ) NF-KB binding activity .
HeLa-tat and parental cells ( 1x 10° each ) were cultured in 6-well microtiter plates overnight .
Then BHA { 500 uM ) and subsequently TNF ( 10 ng/ml ) were added and incubation continued for 30 min .
Extracts were prepared and analyzed for NF-KB binding activity in EMSA .
( B ) NF-xB-dependent transactivation of gene expression .
HeLa cells or HeLa-tat cells were transiently transfected with a 4X NF-KB/CAT construct .
NF-KB activity in the presence or absence of TNF ( 10 ng/ml ) was quantified as percent transacetylation .
Mean values and standard deviations of triplicate samples are given .
inhibited by BHA ( Figure 1A , lane 8 ) , but was still stronger than in the parental cells ( Figure 1A , lane 4 ) .
To provide evidence that increased NF-xB binding activity was also reflected by increased NF-KB-mediated transcriptional activation , we transiently transfected HeLa cells and HeLa-tat cells with a reporter gene construct carrying four copies of the NF-KB binding sequence in front of the CAT gene .
As shown in Figure 1B , constitutive and TNF-induced ( 10 ng/ml ) NF-KB transactivating activities were increased several-fold in HeLa-tat cells as compared with the parental HeLa cells .
The influence of the expression of Tat on TNF-induced cytotoxicity was investigated next .
HeLa and HeLa-tat cells were assayed for TNF sensitivity .
As shown in Figure 2A , HeLa-tat cells were more susceptible to the cytotoxic activity of TNF than the parental cell line .
To kill 50 % of HeLa-tat cells , ~100 times less TNF was required than for the 547 M.O.Westendorp et al .

Survival and growth inhibition of HeLa-tat and parental cells in response to TNF .
( A ) Survival of cells .
HeLa-tat and HeLa parental cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well .
After 16 h , cell cultures were incubated with TNF and incubation was continued for 16 h in the presence of actinomycin D ( 1 ug/ml ) .
Survival was assayed by the reduction of MTT and calculated as the percentage of the staining value of TNF-treated and untreated cultures .
( B ) Growth inhibition .
HeLa-tat cells and parental cells were seeded and exposed to TNF as described above .
Cultures were incubated for a 20 h period .
At 6 h before harvest , each culture received 0.5 uCi [ } HJthymidine .
Cells were then lyzed with 1 % SDS , 0.1 N HCI and radioactivity was counted .
Percent growth was calculated as the percentage of [ *H Jthymidine incorporation of TNF-treated and untreated cultures .
100 % growth corresponds to 73 795 c.p.m .
parental cells .
Similarly , HeLa-tat cells were considerably more susceptible to growth inhibition by TNF ( Figure 2B ) .
Effect of synthetic Tat ( sTat ) on TNF activities It has been shown previously that extracellular Tat is present in the supernatant of HIV-1-infected cells in culture ( Zauli et al .
, 1992 ) .
Furthermore , HIV-1 Tat can enter and disturb non-infected cells in vitro and also possibly in vivo .
Therefore , to investigate whether the observed effects in tat-transfected cells were caused by clonal heterogeneity , experiments with exogenously added Tat protein were performed .
Tat was synthesized as a full-length protein ( Kraft et al .
, 1994 ) .
Control experiments using cells transfected with an HIV-1 LTR reporter construct confirmed that incubation with sTat had transactivating activity ( data not shown ) .
HeLa cells were preincubated with 1 ug/ml sTat for 24 h and then exposed to various concentrations of TNF for 30 min .
As shown in Figure 3A , the addition of sTat protein significantly enhanced TNF-induced activation of NF-KB .
However , Tat treatment alone did not result in enhanced NF-KB binding activity 548 A sT at ais .

TNF-induced activation of NF-KB in HeLa cells ( A ) and Jurkat T cells ( B ) after treatment with sTat protein .
( A ) 1 % 10° HeLa cells were grown in 35 mm Petri dishes , washed with PBS and scraped off the plastic surface in 0.5 ml PBS containing 1 ug/ml sTat at 4°C .
Then 2 ml of culture medium were added and the incubation continued .
After 16 h , TNF was added ( 0.1 , 1.0 and 10.0 ng/ml ) .
After a further 30 min of incubation , cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for NF-xB binding activity in EMSA .
( B ) 1 % 10° Jurkat T cells were incubated with 1 ug/ml sTat which was added to the medium for 16 h. Subsequently , cells were treated with TNF ( 10 ng/ ml ) and processed as in ( A ) .
( Figure 3A ) .
Thus , the higher constitutive NF-KB activity in HeLa-tat cells compared with HeLa cells may be due to clonal heterogeneity and not be directly caused by Tat .
To investigate whether the Tat effects observed in HeLa cells are also seen in T cells , we performed similar experiments in Jurkat T cells and found an equally strong potentiation of NF-KB activity ( Figure 3B ) .
In accordance with the previous experiments , treatment with sTat also enhanced the cytotoxic effects of TNF in HeLa cells ( Figure 4A ) .
Maximal potentiating effects were observed at TNF concentrations between 0.01 and 1.00 ng/ mi and 10 pg/ml of sTat protein .
Jurkat T cells , like other T cell lines , are resistant against the cytotoxic effect of TNF , but exhibit growth inhibition in response to TNF treatment .
We therefore investigated the effect of sTat on TNF-induced proliferation inhibition in Jurkat T cells ( Figure 4B ) .
The results clearly demonstrate a potentiation of TNF-induced growth inhibition by Tat , even at concentrations where TNF alone had only small inhibitory effects .

Incubation was continued in the presence of actinomycin D ( 1 ug/ml ) .

Effects of endogenously produced and sTat protein on Mn-SOD activity and Mn-SOD-specific mRNA levels It has been reported that both the gene-inducing and the cytotoxic effect of TNF are mediated by reactive oxygen intermediates originating in the mitochondrial respiratory chain ( Schulze-Osthoff et al .
, 1992 , 1993 ) .
Important enzymes counteracting oxidative stress are SODs which convert superoxide anion ( O , ~ ) to hydrogen peroxide ( H ; ,0 ; ) .
Mn-SOD , an enzyme located in the mitochondrial matrix , was shown to be induced by various agents conferring oxidative stress to cells , whereas Cu , Zn-con-taining SOD ( Cu , Zn-SOD ) was shown to be constitutively expressed ( Hassan , 1988 ) .
Moreover , the overexpression of Mn-SOD was shown to protect cells against TNF cytotoxicity ( Wong et al .
, 1989 ) .
To examine whether SOD activity is involved in the modulation of TNF effects caused by Tat , extracts of parental HeLa and HeLla-tat cells were assayed for Mn-SOD and Cu , Zn-SOD activity .
As shown in Figure 5A , in HeLa-tat cells the activity of Mn-SOD was decreased to ~50 % of the level measured in parental cells .

Effect of Tat on Mn-SOD and Cu , Zn-SOD transcription .
( A ) Expression of SOD mRNA in HeLa-tat and parental cells .
2X 10 `` cells were seeded in tissue flasks and treated with 10 ng/ml TNF as indicated .
After 4 h total RNA was isolated .
Samples ( 20 ug RNA ) were submitted to electrophoresis on agarose-formaldehyde gels and hybridized with cDNA probes coding for human Mn-SOD and Cu , Zn-SOD .
Mn-SOD RNA levels of HeLa-tat cells compared with HeLa cells as determined by densitometry were 28 ( - TNF ) and 33 % ( + TNF ) .
( B ) Expression of SOD mRNA in HeLa cells after treatment with sTat .
HeLa cells were treated for 20 h with sTat protein ( 1 jig/ml ) .
Then cultures were either left untreated or treated with TNF ( 10 ng/m ! )
for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated , subjected to electrophoresis and hybridized with radiolabeled Mn-SOD and Cu , Zn-SOD cDNA probes .
Mn-SOD RNA levels of Tat-treated HeLa cells compared with control cells as determined by densitometry were 33 ( - TNF ) and 32 % ( + TNF ) .
similar activities of Cu , Zn-SOD .
This decrease in Mn-SOD activity was found to correspond to reduced protein expression .
Dot blot analysis using an antibody against Mn-SOD revealed that Mn-SOD expression was significantly lower in HeLa-tat cells and HeLa cells incubated with sTat cells than in parental HeLa cells or HeLa cells incubated without sTat ( Figure 5B and C ) .
Similar effects were observed in Jurkat T cells treated with sTat ( Figure 5D ) .
Figure 5E shows that the suppression of Mn-SOD protein expression by sTat is dose-dependent .
To determine whether suppressed Mn-SOD activity was caused by a decreased transcription of the Mn-SOD gene , total RNA isolated from both cell types was examined by Northern blot analysis .
As shown in Figure 6A , the steady state level of Mn-SOD mRNA was reduced to ~30 % of normal levels , whereas mRNA expression of Cu , Zn-SOD revealed no significant changes .
The transcription of both enzymes was not altered significantly by treatment with TNF .
In addition , a similar reduction in Mn-SOD mRNA expression was also observed when HeLa cells were treated with sTat protein ( Figure 6B ) .
Full-length , two-exon Tat ( 86 amino acids long , Tat ; _s4 ) is required to repress MHC class I gene promoter activity ( Howcroft et al .
, 1993 ) , while truncated Tat ( Tat ; _ ; ; ) is sufficient to transactivate the HIV-1 LTR ( Kuppuswamy et al .
, 1989 ) .
To define the structural features of HIV-1 Tat required to suppress Mn-SOD expression , Jurkat T cells were incubated with full-length Tat ; _s4 and truncated Tat ; _ ; ; .
As shown in Figure 7 , only Tat ; 34 decreased Mn-SOD expression , whereas Tat ; _ ; , had no effect .

Taken together , our data demonstrate that the repression of Mn-SOD gene expression , like MHC class I expression , requires the C-terminal part of HIV-1 Tat .
They further suggest a common mechanism of gene repression by Tat distinct from HIV-1 gene transactivation .

Effect of HIV-1 Tat on total glutathione content and ratio of GSH : GSSG .
( A ) Glutathione in total cell lysates of Jurkat T cells and HeLa cells transfected with ( HeLa-tat ) or treated with Tat ( + sTat ) was assayed by an enzymatic recycling procedure in which it is sequentially oxidized by 5,5'-dithiobis- ( 2-nitrobenzoic acid ) ( DTNB ) and reduced by NADPH in the presence of glutathione reductase .
( B ) For the determination of glutathione disulfide , GSH was derivatized with 2-vinylpyridine and then exposed to the DTNB assay .
Values are given as the means of three independent determinations .
( D and C ) HeLa and HeLa-tat cells ( D ) or Jurkat T cells ( C ) ( 5 % 10° ) pretreated for 20 h with the indicated amount of sTat were incubated with 20 uM monochlorobimane for 10 min at 37°C .
Tat ; _7 ; , truncated Tat protein lacking amino acids 73-86 .
The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold culture medium .
Then cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and the relative glutathione content was estimated by FACS analysis .
Tat protein decreases the cellular glutathione content and lowers the GSH : GSSG ratio A likely consequence of decreased SOD activity is increased oxidative stress reflected by a decrease in the total amount of glutathione or a decreased ratio of reduced glutathione ( GSH ) to oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) .
GSH , an important antioxidant within cells , serves as a substrate in the reduction of peroxides catalyzed by the seleno-enzyme glutathione peroxidase ( Meister and Anderson , 1983 ) .
In addition , GSH acts as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals .
We measured the influence of HIV-1 Tat on the total content of glutathione and the ratio of GSH : GSSG in both HeLa and Jurkat T cells .
As shown in Figure 8A , the total GSH content present in HeLa-tat cells was decreased to ~50 % of control cells The ratio of GSH : GSSG was ~9.0 in the parental cells and 6.5 in HeLa-tat cells ( Figure 8B ) .
The addition of TNF slightly lowered glutathione content and GSH : GSSG ratios .
The above results in HeLa-tat cells were confirmed in Jurkat T cells and HeLa cells treated with sTat ( Figure 8A and B ) .
As shown in Figure 8C , the treatment of Jurkat T cells with sTat protein decreased the glutathione content in a dose dependent manner from 93 % at 5 ng/ml Tat to 45 % at 1 ug/ml sTat , as measured by fluorescence intensity .
The decrease of GSH levels in HeLa cells after treatment with sTat ( Figure 8D ) was even more pronounced than in Jurkat T cells .
In contrast , the treatment of Jurkat T cells with the truncated Tat ; ; ; had no effect on GSH content ( Figure 8C ) .
Discussion Several reports have demonstrated previously that TNF plays an important role in the progression of AIDS ( for a review see Rosenberg and Fauci , 1990 ) .
High levels of TNF have been observed in sera and in supernatants of monocytes , peripheral blood mononuclear cells and alveolar macrophages from AIDS patients .
TNF levels were shown to become progressively elevated with disease progression towards AIDS ( Lachdevirta et al .
, 1988 ) .
Moreover , TNF is known to stimulate HIV-1 gene expression via activation of the transcription factor NF-xB ( Duh et al .
, 1989 ; Osborn et al .
, 1989 ) , which is modulated by the cellular redox state ( Schreck et al .
, 1991 ; Schulze-Osthoff et al .
, 1993 ) .
Since virus replication is increased by TNF , we investigated whether HIV-1 gene products could also control TNF activity .
Therefore , we examined the ability of HIV-1 Tat to modulate TNF-induced activation of NF-KB .
We used HeLa cells stably transfected with the rat gene and found that the expression of Tat protein enhanced NF-KB activation in response to TNF .
Similarly , synthetic Tat protein , when added to Jurkat T cells or HeLa cells , potentiated TNF-induced NF-xB activation and TNF-mediated cell death .
551 M.O.Westendorp et al .
Tat-modulated activation of NF- « xB by TNF was inhibited by antioxidants such as BHA .
These data suggested that the activity of Tat is linked to cellular redox state .
Therefore , we examined the influence of Tat on Mn-SOD , an enzyme which serves as the primary defense of cells against oxygen-derived free radicals .
Two human genes encode intracellular SOD proteins : the gene for the Mn-dependent SOD and that for the Cu , Zn-dependent SOD .
Only the former is known to be inducible and regulated by diverse oxidative stress-inducing agents ( McCord et al .
, 1977 ; Wong et al .
, 1991 ) .
We observed that HIV-1 Tat , produced intracellularly or added exogenously , strongly reduced Mn-SOD protein expression .
Furthermore , Mn-SOD RNA levels were strongly decreased in cells transfected with fat ( see also Wong et al .
, 1991 ; Flores et al .
, 1993 ) .
Unlike Mn-SOD , Cu , Zn-SOD was not affected significantly .
Similarly , sTat added exogenously to Jurkat T cells or HeLa cells decreased Mn-SOD transcription .
Therefore , HIV-1 Tat produced and released by HIV-l-infected cells can potentially influence the cellular redox state of surrounding non-infected cells .
To shed light on the mechanism of Mn-SOD repression by HIV-1 Tat , we employed a mutant lacking the C-terminus of Tat ( amino acid positions 73-86 ) which is encoded by the second exon of the tat gene .
This truncated protein ( Tati_ ; ; ) contains all elements required for HIV-1 gene transactivation ( Kuppuswamy et al .
, 1989 ) .
However , our experiments clearly demonstrate that Tat ; ; , does not repress Mn-SOD gene expression , suggesting that the C-terminal sequence encoded by the second exon of the tat gene is required for this Tat activity .
Similar observations have been reported previously for the repression of MHC class I gene expression by Tat ( Howcroft et al .
, 1993 ) .
Taken together , we suggest that the repression of gene expression by HIV-1 Tat is based on a distinct mechanism which , unlike transactivation of HIV-1 gene expression , requires the C-terminal part of Tat .
Moreover , we found that Tat-induced down-regulation of Mn-SOD activity in Jurkat T cells and HeLa-tat cells was accompanied by a decreased glutathione content and by a decreased ratio of GSH : GSSG .
Such an imbalance of the antioxidant defense system enhances the susceptibility of cells towards the cytotoxic action of TNF ( Wong et al .
, 1989 ; Schulze-Osthoff et al .
, 1992 , 1993 ) .
In accordance with this assumption , we found that HIV-1 Tat potentiated both the cytotoxic action of TNF and its inhibitory effect on T cell proliferation ( Figures 2 and 4B ) .
In line with the observed effect on Mn-SOD expression , Tat ; ; , had no effect on GSH content ( Figure 8D ) and TNF-mediated cytotoxicity ( data not shown ) .
Based on these findings , we suggest that Tat modulates TNF activity by the following mechanisms .
Inhibition of Mn-SOD synthesis by Tat leads to an increase in superoxide anion concentration .
Superoxide is a poorly reactive radical and may diffuse in the cell before it encounters an appropriate reaction partner .
Such partners may include metal ions such as Fe** which becomes reduced to Fe* ions .
Fe®* catalyzes the production of the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that give rise to secondary reactive products such as peroxides .
Increasing amounts of peroxides are counteracted by glutathione peroxidase .
This enzyme depletes reduced stores of glutathione .
A decrease in reduced glutathione may result in a state of generalized 552 induction of cytotoxicity NF-kB HIV-1 activation E D TAT Mn-SOD downregulation t oxidative stress Fig .

Proposed interrelationship between Tat , TNF and oxidative stress in HIV-1 infection .
oxidative stress that amplifies TNF activity including TNF-induced activation of NF-KB and TNF-induced cytotoxicity .
Furthermore , it is known that TNF production is progressively increased during HIV-1 infection .
Therefore , we suspect that a positive feed-back loop may exist between Tat protein and TNF that stimulates rapid progression of the disease .
The interaction between Tat , the cellular redox system and TNF relevant to disease progression in AIDS is depicted in Figure 9 .
During the initial infection HIV-1 invades cells of the immune system , such as macrophages , and activates the expression of cellular genes including the TNF gene .
TNF then stimulates HIV-1 replication and Tat production via activation of the transcription factor NF-xB .
Tat induces oxidative stress which further enhances the activity of TNF , CD4* T cells incapable of repairing the ensuing oxidative stress are primed to undergo cell death ( Fauci , 1993 ) .
A consequence of these events might be a decrease in the immunological effector functions .
Tat is secreted by HIV-1-infected cells ( Zauli et al .
, 1992 ) and is also taken up by non-infected cells ( Frankel and Pabo , 1988 ; Westendorp et al .
, 1994 ) .
It has been speculated that these mechanisms also occur in vivo .
Thus , Tat-producing and surrounding non-infected cells might be similarly affected , undergo a change in redox state and become more susceptible to infection or the cytotoxic action of cytokines .
A vicious cycle may lead to a steady increase of TNF and Tat and to a decrease of antioxidants such as reduced glutathione .
These events might finally cause a severe aggravation of the disease .
The link between Tat and TNF action and sulfhydryl consumption may also account for the decreased glutathione levels observed in sera of HIV-1-infected patients ( Gmiinder et al .
, 1990 ; Staal et al .
, 1992 ) .
Taken together , our data suggest that HIV-1 has found mechanisms that stimulate its own reproduction .
These mechanisms involve the control of the cellular redox system and the generation of increased amounts of oxidants .
The understanding of the interaction between TNF , Tat protein and the cellular redox system may open new ways for therapeutic intervention in AIDS .
These may include drugs that interfere with Tat activity ( Zapp et al .
, 1993 ) or antioxidants , such as N-acetyl-cysteine , which replenish depleted glutathione levels and restore a normal cellular redox state ( Droge et al .
, 1992 ) .
Materials and methods Cell culture Jurkat T cells and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 ( GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , HEPES ( 0.02 M ) and 50 ug/ml gentamycin .
HeLa cells stably transfected with an HIV-1 tat expression vector ( Valerie et al .
, 1988 ) were subcloned twice .
The expression of HIV-1 tat was determined by transient transfection of the cells with a CAT reporter gene construct driven by the HIV LTR enhancer .
CAT activity was determined as described ( Gorman , 1985 ) .
Expression of the HIV-1 LTR CAT construct in HeLa cells transfected with the rat gene ( HeLa-tat cells ) was ~1200-fold , as compared with the parental HeLa cell line .
Materials rTNF with an activity of 5x10 `` U/mg protein was provided by BASF ( Ludwigshafen , Germany ) .
A mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing human Mn-SOD was obtained from Bender ( Vienna , Austria ) .
A CAT reporter gene construct carrying four copies of the NF-KB binding motif ( 4X NF-xB/CAT ; Westendorp et al .
, 1994 ) was used for the transient transfection of HeLa cells .
Treatment of cells with sTat The synthesis of full-length HIV-1 Tat ( 86 amino acids , HIV-1 strain BL 16 ) will be described elsewhere ( Kraft et a/ .
, 1994 ) .
A mutant of HIV-1 Tat comprising the first 72 amino acid positions ( Tat_ ; > ) was synthesized accordingly .
The biological activity of both sTat proteins was determined by treatment with sTat of HeLa cells transiently transfected with an HIV-1 LTR-driven CAT reporter gene construct , followed by assaying CAT activity .
HeLa cells 'scrape-loaded ' ( Gentz et al .
, 1989 ) with 1 ug/ml sTat showed an ~680-fold higher LTR activity as compared with control HeLa cells 'scrape-loaded ' with 1 ug/ml bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) .
To examine the ability of sTat to influence TNF-mediated cytotoxicity and proliferation inhibition , cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml to 10 ug/ml sTat for 4-24 h as indicated in the text .
To evaluate the modulation of TNF-induced activation of NF-KB by the protein , sTat was introduced into HeLa cells by 'scrape loading ' .
Briefly , 1X 10° HeLa cells were grown in 35 mm Petri dishes , washed once with PBS and scraped off the plastic surface in 1 ml of cold PBS ( 4°C ) containing 1 or 10 pg/ml sTat .
Then 2 ml of culture medium were added to the cell suspension and incubation was continued at 37°C .
In one experiment sTat was inactivated by exposing the protein solution to a flow of molecular oxygen .
Proliferation and cytotoxicity assay The cytotoxic activity of TNF was determined by a colorimetric assay ( MTT test ; Sladowski et al .
, 1993 ) .
HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 1x 10 % cells per well in 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates and incubated for 16 h in 0.2 ml culture medium .
The supernatant was then removed and replaced by fresh medium containing serial dilutions of TNF and actinomycin D ( 1 ug/ml ) .
Incubation was continued for 16 h followed by the addition of 10 ul of an MTT solution ( 5 mg/ml PBS ) .
After another 4 h incubation , supernatants were removed , followed by the addition of 150 ul of a solution containing 4 % ( v/v ) HCI and 96 % ( v/v ) isopropanol .
The absorbance of each well was determined with an automated plate reader ( SLT Easy Reader EAR 400 AT , Crailsheim , Germany ) at 550 nm .
Survival was calculated as the percentage of the staining value of untreated cultures .
Percent cytotoxicity is the difference between control ( 100 % ) and percent survival .
Proliferation was measured by [ *H thymidine incorporation ( 0.5 uCi , specific activity 185 GBq/mMol ; Amersham , Braunschweig , Germany ) for the last 6 h of a 20 h culture period .
Cells were then lyzed with 1 % SDS , 0.1 N HCI and radioactivity was counted .
Determination of SOD activity SOD was assayed by the cytochrome c method ( McCord and Fridovich , 1969 ) .
The two forms of SOD ( Cu , Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD ) were distinguished by their differential sensitivity to cyanide .
Intracellular GSH and GSSG measurement GSH and GSSG were determined as described previously ( Griffith , 1980 ) .
In some experiments GSH was estimated using FACS analysis Modulation of TNF effects by Tat of monochlorobimane-stained cells ( Staal er a/ .
, 1990 ) .
Cells kept in culture medium were loaded with 20 uM monochlorobimane ( Molecular Probes Inc. , Eugene , OR , USA ) for 10 min at 37°C .
The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold medium .
Then cells were washed three times with cold PBS ; FACS measurement was performed immediately after staining using the FACS Vantage ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) with the excitation set at 351-364 nm and the emission filter at 450 nm ( Omega 450 DF-65 ) .
Dead cells were excluded by forward-and side-scatter gating ; mean values from duplicate samples were considered for data analysis .
Dot blot analysis Total cell lysates ( 1 X 10° cells , equal amounts of protein ) were dotted onto a HybondTM nitrocellulose membrane ( Amersham ) in log 2 dilutions .
The membrane was washed six times with PBS , incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against human Mn-SOD , washed six times as described above , incubated for 90 min at room temperature with 1:4000 diluted peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) and washed again as described above .
Signals were developed using the enhanced chemoluminescence reaction as described by the manufacturer _ ( Amersham ) ; _ autoradiographs _ were - quantified densitometrically .
Northern blot analysis Total cellular RNA was prepared according to Chirgwin er al .
( 1979 ) .
Cells were either left untreated or incubated for 18 h with HIV-1 Tat ( 1 ug/ml ) , followed by the addition of TNF ( 10 ng/m ! )
for another 4 h. RNA ( 20 ug ) was subjected to electrophoresis employing 1 % formaldehyde-agarose gels , transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary blotting and fixed by UV irradiation .
Hybridization was carried out at 42°C in 50 mM Tris-HCI , pH 7.5 , 0.1 % sodium pyrophosphate , 1 % SDS , 0.2 % polyvinylpyrrolidone , 0.2 % Ficoll , 5 mM EDTA , 0.2 % BSA , 10 % dextran sulfate and 50 % formamide .
The blots were washed to a stringency of 0.5 % SSC ( SSC : 15 mM sodium citrate , 150 mM NaCl ) ) and 0.1 % SDS at 62°C , and then exposed to an X-ray film at 70°C .
A 650 bp fragment of human Mn-SOD cDNA and a 600 bp fragment of human Cu , Zn-SOD cDNA were labeled with *°P and used as hybridization probes ( Amstad er al .
, 1991 ) .
Autoradiographs were quantified densitometrically .
Preparation of total cell extracts Cells ( 1X10° per sample ) were incubated with TNF for 30 min as indicated , harvested , washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 100 pl of high salt buffer containing 20 mM HEPES , pH 7.6 , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgC1 ; , 0.5 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM EGTA , 20 % glycerol , 1 % NP-40 , 0.5 mM DDT , 10 pg/ml leupeptin , 1 mM PMSF and 0.001 % aprotinin .
After 15 min incubation on ice , lysates were centrifuged and supernatants were transferred to new vials and kept frozen at -70°C .
EMSAs EMSAs were performed as follows .
Equal amounts of extracts ( 10 pug protein , determined by a protein assay kit ; Bio-Rad , Munich , Germany ) were incubated with an NF-xB-specific +°P-labeled oligonucleotide .
The sequence of the double-stranded 30 bp probe comprising the NF-KB site and flanking sequences from the mouse kappa light chain enhancer is shown in Zabel er al .
( 1991 ) .
Binding reactions were performed in a 20 ul volume containing 2 ug poly ( dI-dC ) , 2 ug BSA , 20 mM HEPES , pH 7.5 , 50 mM KCI , 1 mM DDT , 2.5 mM MgCl ; , 4 % Ficoll and 3000-6000 c.p.m .
of the random primer-labeled oligonucleotide .
After 20 min at room temperature , samples were loaded onto a 4 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5 % TBE buffer at pH 8.0 .
After electrophoresis , gels were dried and exposed overnight to a Kodak X-ray film with an intensifying screen .
