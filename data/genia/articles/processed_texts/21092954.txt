The octamer element is common to all Ig promoters and pivotal for their function .
However , other conserved sequence motifs , that differ between Ig variable gene families , are required for normal promoter function .
These conserved motifs do not stimulate transcription in the absence of an octamer .
One example is an E-box of the E47/E12 type ( 5-CAGCTG-3 ' ) , which is found in all promoters of the human and murine Ig- « gene subgroups/families , with the exception of subgroups II and VI and their related murine families .
In the present study we show that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor AP-4 , and not E47 , interacts specifically with the x promoter E-boxes when tested in electrophoretic mobility-shift assays using nuclear extracts derived from human and murine B-cell lines .
Furthermore , AP-4 , unlike E47 , did not act as a transactivator , which is in agreement with previous studies on intact x promoters , showing that transcription is absent when the octamer element has been mutated .
Based on these data , and the conservation of the 5-CAGCTG-3 ' motif among human and murine x promoters , we propose that AP-4 is the major ligand for Ig- « promoter E-boxes .
Key words : bHLH-Zip protein , conserved sequences , immunoglobulin genes .
INTRODUCTION Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) - « V gene sequences from humans and mice have been classified into a number of subgroups and families , respectively , according to sequence similarities in their coding regions [ 1,2 ] .
However , Vx gene conservation also extends into the promoter regions .
Although the octamer motif and the TATA box are the only elements that are conserved in all Vr promoters , other elements are conserved within different subgroups and families [ 3,4 ] .
The octamer interacts with the Oct family of transcription factors [ 5 ] .
It is essential for the normal function of Ig promoters , since mutations in the octamer that abrogate Oct binding result in levels of transcription similar to those observed with a TATA box only [ 6-8 ] .
However , a minimal Ig promoter containing an octamer as the sole upstream element can only stimulate 10-20 % of the transcriptional activity seen with an intact x promoter [ 7,9 ] .
Hence , « promoters are dependent on additional functional DNA elements for full activity [ 9,10 ] .
These co-stimulatory elements , however , are not capable of stimulating transcription by themselves but are strictly dependent on the presence of an octamer element for activity .
Thus « promoter function is based on functional modularity [ 10 ] .
Some of the co-stimulatory DNA elements are conserved within Vx subgroups /families and between species , and some are not [ 4 ] .
Examples of the former are the E-box motifs that are conserved within the human Vx subgroups I , III , IV , V and VII and the related murine families , and the CCCT motif that is conserved within the human Vx II subgroup and its related murine families [ 4 ] .
Interestingly , the majority of the E-boxes found in Vx promoters are of the E2A type CANCTG-3 ' ) [ 4 ] , indicating that they are potential recognition sites for the £24 gene products E47 and E12 [ 11 ] .
However , this represents a paradox , since the £24 gene products are intrinsically potent activators of transcription [ 12-14 ] .
Previous studies have indicated that basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) proteins interact in vitro with « k promoter E-boxes [ 15,16 ] .
However , E47 , although reported to bind optimally to the E-box sequence 5-CAGCTG-3 ' [ 17 ] , interacted poorly with x-promoter E-boxes [ 18 ] , indicating that some other bHLH protein might be the E-box binding factor .
AP-4 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor of the bHLH-Zip subgroup of bHLH proteins , that binds the 5'-CAGCTG-3 ' motif [ 19 ] .
It was first identified as a factor binding to the simian virus ( SV ) 40 enhancer , and was shown to interact synergistically with AP-1 to increase transcription in vitro from the SV40 late promoter [ 20 ] .
Dimerization of bHLH proteins through the helix-loop-helix domain is a prerequisite for specific DNA binding via a short region of basic residues .
In addition , bHLH-Zip proteins possess a second dimerization domain , the leucine zipper [ 21 ] .
AP-4 is unique in that it contains an additional leucine zipper .
Hence , AP-4 presents a specific tripartite dimerization structure , suggesting that AP-4 may interact with a wide variety of transcription factors [ 19 ] .
However , there are no known heterodimerization partners of AP-4 .
Recently , the Drosophila homologue of human AP-4 has been cloned , and shows a high degree of similarity to the human and Caenorhabditis elegans counterparts within the bHLH-Zip domain , the second leucine zipper and a third conserved region of unknown function [ 22 ] .
In the present work , we show that AP-4 is a ligand for x-promoter E-boxes , indicating an important and novel role for this ubiquitously expressed regulator in the expression of lincage-restricted genes .

The MD3 vector contains six copies of the myc-epitope inserted into peDNA3 , as described in [ 14 ] .
The peDNA3 vector encoding Syrian hamster E47 cDNA ( EA47-pcDNA3 ) , and the expression plasmid encoding a Myc-epitope-tagged version of E47 ( E47 cDNA cloned into MD3-E47MD3 ) are also described in [ 14 ] .
The 4 x pd-luciferase reporter plasmid was made by inserting a PCR-amplified 4x pd fragment into the basal fos reporter ( pGL3fos ) [ 14 ] .
The pGL3fos contains sequences -56 to +109 from the c-fos promoter cloned into pGL3Basic ( Promega ) .
The 4 x pd-fragment was made using the 5° SP6 primer : 5 'd ( TAT-TTAGGTGACACTATAG ) and the 3 ' primer : 5d ( ATAAGA-TCTAA TCATGCCTGCA ) , with the 4x pdTATACAT-E construct as a template [ 15 ] .

Nuclear extracts , proteins translated in vifro and electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ( EMSA ) Nuclear extracts from B-lymphoid ( human : Raji , Namalwa , BJAB ; murine : K46R and $ 194 ) and non-lymphoid ( HeLa ) cell lines , as well as from lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated ( 72 h ) primary murine spleen cells were prepared according to Schreiber et al .
[ 23 ] .
In vitro translated AP-4 and E47 were made using the AP-4-pGEM3Z plasmid or the E47-pecDNA3 plasmid , respectively , and the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
For EMSAs , 1 ul of in vitro translated proteins or 2 wl of nuclear extract were mixed with 1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) in 15 wl of binding buffer [ 20 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 6.0 ) , 10 mM MgCl , , 0.1 mM EDTA , 2 mM dithiothreitol , 0.01 % ( v/v ) Nonidet P-40 , 0.1 mM NaCl , 100 ug/ml BSA and 4 % ( w/v ) Ficoll ] .
Samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature before the addition of competitors or antibodies directed against E47 ( 1 wl , Santa Cruz sc-763 X ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , U.S.A. ) or AP-4 ( kindly provided by Dr R. B. Gaynor ) , and incubated for a further 15 min at room temperature .
*°P-Labelled probe samples ( 30000 c.p.m . )
were added and the samples were kept at room temperature for 20 min before resolution by PAGE ( 5 % polyacrylamide gel ) in TBE [ 0.09 M Tris/borate ( pH 8.0 ) /2 mM EDTA ] .
Probes and competitors °*°P-Labelled or unlabelled oligonucleotides were annealed to unlabelled antisense oligonucleotides and used as probes or competitors respectively .
The sense-strand sequence of each of the different oligonucleotides used in EMSA are shown in Figure 2 ( C ) .
Cells and transfections Cells were cultured in RPMI with glutamine ( Gibco BRL ) supplemented with 7-8 % fetal-calf serum , 10 mM Hepes , 1 mM © 2001 Biochemical Society sodium pyruvate and 50 ug/ml gentamicin .
HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectin® ( Gibco BRL ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Transfections were performed in 24-well plates and 2.5 x 10° cells/well were grown overnight to 40-60 % confluency .
Subsequently , 0.6 ug of expression plasmid and 0.2 4g of reporter plasmid in 1 ml of serum-free medium ( Optimem ; Gibco BRL ) containing 5 wl of Lipofectin® was added to each well .
The transfection mixture was removed after 24 h and replaced with 1 ml of serum-containing medium .
After incubation for a further 24 h , the cells were washed once in 1 ml of PBS ( Gibco BRL ) and harvested into 80 l of reporter lysis buffer ( Promega ) .
The lysate was kept on ice for 10 min and then frozen at -70 °C for > 30 min .
A sample ( 20 wl ) of the lysate was assayed for luciferase activity using 100 wl of luciferase assay reagent ( Promega ) in a MicroLumat LB96D luminometer ( EG & G ; Berthold , Pforzheim , Germany ) .
For each experiment , every combination of expression and reporter plasmids was co-transfected in triplicate , and experiments were independently repeated two or three times .
Data shown are the mean values for each experiment normalized to the values obtained after co-transfection with reporter plasmid and empty expression plasmid .
SDS/PAGE and Western-blot analysis SDS/PAGE and electroblotting were performed according to standard procedures [ 24 ] .
Briefly , the reporter lysis buffer lysate from transfected cells ( see above ) was denatured in SDS loading buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol , and separated by SDS / PAGE ( 12 % gel ) .
The proteins were transferred on to a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , which was blocked in 5 % ( w/v ) skimmed milk in PBST [ 0.05 % ( v/v ) Tween in PBS ] for 30 min and washed three times for 5 min each time in PBST .
Next , the membrane was incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of a mouse anti-mye antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) in PBST and then washed as before .
The secondary antibody , a rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , diluted 1:3750 in PBST , was added for 20 min and then removed by washing .
Detection of the antibody-protein complexes by luminescence was performed using the ECL® kit ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
RESULTS E-boxes in x promoters The regulation of Ig transcription using the SP6 x promoter as a model ( Figure 1A ) has been studied previously [ 9,10,18 ] .
This mouse x promoter contains an octamer element [ 3,25 ] with a one-base mismatch from the consensus sequence , which is compensated for by octamer flanking nucleotides [ 26,27 ] .
Furthermore , octamer-dependent , positive transcriptional-control elements are found 5 and 3 ' of the octamer .
Functionally these can be divided into three regions : the pd- « Y region , the CCCT motif and the 3 ' E-box .
The pd- « Y region contains three protein binding motifs : an E-box of the E2A type , an A-T-rich region [ 3 ] and the « Y element [ 28,29 ] .
These three elements stimulate octamer-induced transcription in concert , since a mutation in any of the elements obliterates the positive effect of the whole region [ 16 ] .
The CCCT motif and the 3 ' E-box independently stimulate octamer-dependent transcription [ 10,18 ] .
The activity of the various subregions of the SP6 x promoter is summarized in Figure 1 ( B ) .
With the advent of sequence information from the human « locus [ 2 ] , it became evident that the SP6 x promoter represents a composite of a typical human Vx I and a Vx II subgroup promoter [ 4 ] .
Hence , the pd element is conserved in the human Transcription factor AP-4 is a ligand for x promoter E-boxes 433 Oct-1/0ct-2 EBF 2 ElA pentadecamer ( pd ) xeY Octamer CCct 3 `` E-box TATA element AACAGCTGTGTAATT GCACAGCTGCTC E-box .

Vk I promoters , whereas the CCCT element is conserved in Vx II promoters .
In addition , the E-boxes in x promoters are well conserved , both with regard to sequence ( 5-CAGCTG-3 ' ; Figure 1C ) and to their position relative to the octamer and the TATA box [ 4 ] .
Given that the E-boxes in x promoters show this high degree of conservation and functional activity , we favour the view that they are relevant transcriptional control elements for developmentally regulated Ig expression .
In vitro translated AP-4 and E47 bind to the SPG x promoter pd element We have noted previously that , although the SP6 x promoter E-boxes are candidate targets for £24 gene products , the results of an investigation of the relevant interaction using nuclear extracts were ambiguous [ 18 ] .
Since the pd-E-box sequence 5-CAGCTG-3 ' is also a putative binding site for the bHLH-Zip protein AP4 [ 20 ] , the ability of E47 and/or AP-4 to bind the pd element in vitro was investigated .
As shown in Figure 2 ( A ) , in an EMSA using AP-4 translated in vitro and the pd element probe , a complex was formed ( lanes 2 and 10 ) .

effectively removed by the addition of an excess of unlabelled pd element ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , and by a pd element with a mutated A-T-rich region ( pdA-Tmut ; lanes 11 and 12 ) .
In contrast , a pd element carrying a mutation in the E-box ( pdE-box mut ; lanes 7 and 8 ) failed to compete , as did the 4E5 oligonucleotide ( lanes 5 and 6 ) and the octamer oligonucleotide ( lanes 15 and 16 ) .
These results indicate that in vitro translated AP-4 binds specifically to the pd-region E-box .
We also investigated whether the E-box present in the SP6 x promoter 3'-region interacted with in vitro translated AP-4 .
This was indeed the case , since an unlabelled 3 `` -region oligonucleotide also competed with the AP-4 complex ( lanes 13 and 14 ) .
© 2001 Biochemical Society 434 A. Aranburu and others The pd-element E-box was , as expected , also a target for in vitro translated E47 ( Figure 2B ) .
A complex formed with E47 and labelled pd probe ( lane 2 ) , was efficiently removed by an excess of unlabelled pd element ( lanes 3 and 4 ) but not by pdE-box mut ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
The wE5 oligonucleotide ( a known target for binding by E47 [ 30 ] ) was at least as good a competitor as the pd element itself ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , and so was a composite oligonucleotide , pd-uE5 , containing the wES-motif and the flanking sequences from the pd element ( lanes 9 and 10 ) .
Thus E47 translated in vitro has affinity for both the pd-element E-box as well as the yE5 motif ( Figure 2C ) .
Furthermore , the specificity of the interaction appeared to reside in the E-box core sequence and not in the flanking regions ( compare 4E5 with pd-4E5 ) .
AP-4 , on the other hand , showed a strong preference for the pd-E-box , although it also bound the E5 oligonucleotide when it was used as probe ( results not shown ) .
AP-4 , but not E47 , binds to the pd element in nuclear extracts Having established that in vitro translated AP-4 and E47 have affinity for SP6 x promoter E-boxes we then investigated whether the pd element was bound by either AP-4 or E47 in nuclear extracts , and a series of gel retardation experiments , using nuclear extracts from human non-lymphoid ( HeLa ) and B-lymphoid cell lines ( Raji , Namalwa and BJAB ) , were performed .
Figure 3 ( A ) shows the results obtained using the Raji cell line with the pd element as a probe ; two major gel-retarded complexes were observed .
The higher mobility band corresponds to CArG-box binding factor-A [ 31 ] , whereas the lower mobility band showed a similar pattern of competition as in vitro translated AP-4 when using the same set of competitors .
The addition of an excess of the unlabelled pd element ( Figure 3A , lanes 2 and 3 ) , the pdA-T mut ( lanes 9 and 10 ) or the 3 ' E-box ( lanes 11 and 12 ) inhibited binding of the nuclear factor .
Neither pdE-box mut ( lanes 6 and 7 ) nor the octamer oligonucleotide ( lanes 13 and 14 ) prevented formation of the specific complex , whereas zE5 competed slightly for complex formation in nuclear extracts ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
It should be noted that strongly inhibited complex formation between in vitro translated E47 and the pd element probe , whereas this was not the case when using in vitro translated AP4 ( compare Figure 2B , lanes 7 and 8 , and Figure 2A , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Similar results were obtained using nuclear extracts from the Namalwa , BJAB and HeLa cell lines ( results not shown ) .
To unequivocally identify the pd-element binding factor , the specific complex was further analysed by the addition of anti-bodies .
As shown in Figure 3 ( B ) , a polyclonal antibody against AP-4 [ 17 ] prevented formation of the complex ( lanes 2-4 ) , whereas an antibody directed against E47 did not ( lane 5 ) .
Since both in vitro translated AP-4 and E47 could bind to the same site , but only AP-4 appeared to be involved in complex formation in nuclear extracts , we next addressed the question whether E47 was present in the nuclear extract preparations .
The E5 probe with Raji nuclear extracts as a source of protein was used in an EMSA .
As shown in Figure 3 ( C ) , three gel-retarded complexes were obtained .
The addition of antibodies against E47 ( lane 3 ) and AP-4 ( lane 2 ) showed that the slower migrating complex contained E47 , whereas the faster migrating complex contained AP-4 .
We conclude from these data that AP-4 is the preferred pd-element ligand in nuclear extracts , even in the presence of E47 , which has an intrinsic affinity for the pd-element E-box ( Figure 2B ) .
AP-4 also binds to the 3 ' E-box in the SPG x promoter Figures 2 ( A ) and 3 ( A ) show that the addition of an excess of the 3 ' E-box oligonucleotide inhibited binding of AP-4 to the pd © 2001 Biochemical Society A pd LES - pdE-box pdA-T 3° Octamer mut mut E-box P met [ P Cant HO oath | a==7 _- ) __ Rall | -- -- -- -- -- -- _ Raji -- -- -- -- -- « b do -- ar-1 .- « s 10 R 3 4 50 6 7 8 0 9 10 ff 12 93 14 B C o-AP4 a Torm - ] & % d Poa & 4 & Raji Raji « « » aun « * « # 6 « g- E47 « l- AP-4 Figure 3 _ AP-4 , but not E47 , binds the pd-element E-box In nuclear extracts derived from the Rajl cell line ( A ) EMSA with nuclear extracts from the Raji ( human B-cell lymphoma ) cell ling as a source of protein and a radiolabelled pd-element probe .

probe , indicating that the 3 ' E-box might also be a binding site for AP-4 .
In order to confirm this , we performed EMSAs with human B-cell lymphoma nuclear extracts and a labelled 3 ' E-box probe ( Figure 4A ) .
Two complexes were formed , a specific low-mobility band and an non-specific band with higher mobility .
Formation of the specific complex was inhibited by the addition of an excess of unlabelled 3 ' E-box ( lanes 2 and 3 ) and by the pd element ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , whereas addition of 4E5 ( lanes 6 and 7 ) , pdE-boxmut ( lane 8 ) or the octamer oligonucleotide ( lane 9 ) did not compete for binding .
The low-mobility band was shown to contain AP-4 , since its formation was prevented by the addition of an anti-AP-4 antibody ( Figure 4B , lanes 2-4 ) but not by an anti-E47 antibody ( lane 5 ) .
In conclusion , these results demonstrate that AP-4 also is the preferred ligand for the SP6 k 3 E-box .

AP-4 in nuclear extracts from murine B-cell lines binds to the pd element The antibody against AP-4 was raised against the human AP-4 protein [ 17 ] , and therefore all our initial experiments were made using nuclear extracts derived from human B-cell lines .

In lanes 4 and 5 , antibodies against AP-4 ( z-AP4 ) or E47 ( a-E47 ) respectively were added .
since our model promoter is the murine SP6 x promoter , we also tested for complex formation using the pd element and nuclear extracts derived from the murine lymphoid cell lines K46R ( a B-cell lymphoma ) and $ 194 ( a plasmacytoma ) , as well as from primary LPS-stimulated murine spleen cells .
Figure 5 shows the results of an EMSA using the $ 194 plasmacytoma cell line .
A complex was detected ( lane 3 ) with similar electrophoretic mobility to the complex formed using in vitro translated AP-4 ( lane 1 ) , and to that formed with nuclear extracts from the human Raji cell line ( lane 2 ) .
Moreover , the $ 194 complex was removed by the addition of the anti-AP-4 antibody ( lane 4 ) but not by the anti-E47 antibody ( lane 5 ) .
Similar results were obtained with nuclear extracts from K46R and LPS-stimulated spleen cells ( results not shown ) , indicating that AP-4 , and not E47 or any other bHLH protein , was the preferred protein interacting with the pd element in murine B cells .
Ectopically expressed AP-4 does not transactivate a pd-element reporter construct AP-4 was initially identified as an SV40 enhancer binding factor capable of stimulating SV40 transcription in vitro , and it has been reported to bind several viral and cellular enhancers .
However , not much is known about the function of AP-4 in promoting transcription , in contrast to the well-known trans-activation properties of E47 .
We wanted to compare the ability of AP-4 and E47 to transactivate a reporter construct containing the pd element as a regulatory element .
We therefore made a reporter plasmid carrying four copies of the pd element linked to the c-fos minimal promoter and a luciferase reporter gene .

Fold induction was calculated relative to the level of luciferase expression obtained with pcDNA3 .
( B ) Western-blot analysis of lysates used to measure luciferase activity as in ( A ) , showing that Myc-tagged AP-4 is expressed equally well as the Myc-tagged E47 .
Lysates were from co-transfections using the indicated expression and reporter plasmids .
The proteins were detected with a Myc antibody and the arrows indicate the positions of Myc-tagged AP-4 and Myc-tagged E47 respectively .
Molecular-mass standards are indicated on the right .
with an expression vector encoding Myc-tagged versions of either AP-4 or E47 .
The ability of AP-4 and E47 to transactivate a luciferase reporter carrying two copies each of the 4E2 and wE5 motifs as regulatory element was also analysed .
As shown in Figure 6 ( A ) , E47 transactivated the pd-construct poorly ( about © 2001 Biochemical Society 10-fold ) , whereas the wE2-uES-construct was very efficiently activated ( 200-fold ) .
In contrast , AP-4 did not transactivate any of the reporter constructs .
The Myc-tagged versions of both AP4 and E47 were efficiently expressed in the transfected cells , as seen in Figure 6 ( B ) , which shows a Western-blot of the same lysates as those used for assaying luciferase activity in a representative transfection experiment .
In addition , the Myc-tagged version of AP-4 bound the pd probe efficiently in an EMSA { results not shown ) .
In addition , co-transfection experiments using untagged AP-4 were performed and similar results to those where the Myc-tagged version was used were obtained ( results not shown ) .
Thus we conclude that , at least in the context of the pd element , AP-4 is not a transactivator but must act via alternate mechanisms ( see below ) .
The low level of activation induced by epitope-tagged E47 on the 4x pd-reporter when compared with its effect on the wE2-uE5-construct is probably due to E47 being excluded from the pd-E-box site by endogenous AP-4 , since no binding of E47 to the pd probe was detected in EMSAs when using nuclear exctracts as a source of protein ( Figure 3B ) .
In addition , we did not detect E47 binding to the pd probe in nuclear extracts prepared after transfection of HeLa cells with the E47 expression plasmid , whereas binding to the wE5 probe was readily detected ( results not shown ) .
DISCUSSION In this study our goal was to identify the ligand for the two E-boxes present in the SP6 x promoter .
Using synthetic mutant or wild-type pd element oligonucleotides , in addition to a wild-type 3 ' E-box oligonucleotide in EMSA experiments , we have shown that the bHLH-Zip protein AP-4 interacts in a specific fashion with both E-boxes .
Both in vitro translated AP-4 and nuclear-extract-derived AP-4 exhibited similar competition patterns and , in nuclear extracts , the major protein-DNA complex formed was shown to contain AP-4 when specific antibodies were used .
Experiments were carried out with human B-cell lymphomas ( Raji , Namalwa and BJAB ) and with several murine cell lines and similar results were obtained .
The majority of the E-boxes found in « promoters are putative AP-4 binding sites ( Figure 1C ) , and it has been speculated that the original x gene promoter contained a TATA-box , an octamer element and possibly an E-box [ 32 ] .
Since the latter element is well conserved in x promoters [ 4 ] , and our findings show that AP-4 binds to both E-boxes in the SP6 « k promoter , we would like to propose AP-4 as the major ligand for xk promoter E-boxes .
It should be noted that the pd element is a weak stimulatory element when present as four copies in a minimal promoter [ 15 ] , indicating that none of the pd-element ligands should be strong transcriptional activators .
Furthermore , the activity of each of the SP6 « co-stimulatory elements is octamer-dependent , precluding the possibility of a strong activator binding to any of these sites and thereby overuling the function of the octamer-binding proteins .
This functional profile of pd interacting proteins fits nicely with the transfection data shown in the present study , where no stimulation was seen with AP-4 but the potent activator function of E47 disqualified it as a pd-element ligand , given that all x promoter transcription should be octamer-dependent [ 6-8,10 ] .
In vitro translated E47 showed a robust interaction with the pd probe in EMSAs , whereas no interaction between E47 and the pd probe was detected when nuclear extracts were used .
This might be due to AP-4 being more abundantly expressed than E47 and/or having a higher intrinsic affinity for the pd element .
AP-4 has been shown to interact with sites in both promoter and enhancer regions of viral and cellular enhancers .
For Transcription factor AP-4 is a ligand for x promoter E-boxes 437 instance , a sequence conserved in several enhancers of pancreatic cell-specific genes is also conserved within the amylase 2A enhancer and contains an AP-4-recognition sequence .
Mutation of this site inactivates enhancer activity and abolishes binding of AP-4 in vitro [ 33 ] .
In addition , the enhancers of the human proenkephalin gene [ 34 ] , the metallothionein IIA gene , the polyoma virus and the SV40 virus [ 20,35 ] , as well as the bovine leukaemia virus long-terminal repeat [ 36 ] , the distal regulatory region of the porcine insulin-like growth-factor binding protein-2 gene [ 37 ] , the human angiotensinogen gene promoter region [ 38 ] and the human immunodeficiency virus type-l ( HIV-1 ) TATA element [ 17 ] , have all been shown to interact with AP-4 .
The exact molecular mechanisms by which AP-4 influences transcription at these different sites is , however , not known and in several cases AP-4 has even been proposed to repress gene expression .
For example , binding of AP-4 to the HIV-1 TATA element in vitro was found to compete for TATA-box binding protein binding to this element , and to inhibit in vitro transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat [ 17 ] .
Co-transfection of an expression vector containing AP-4 coding sequences down-regulated the expression of reporter constructs containing the human angiotensinogen gene promoter [ 38 ] and diminished Tax-activated expression from a construct containing the bovine leukaemia virus long-terminal repeat [ 36 ] .
Within the late promoter region of SV40 , AP-4 appears to be involved in conferring significant levels of nuclease sensitivity , thus implicating AP-4 in chromatin remodelling [ 35 ] .
Based on its homology to transcription factors Myc and Max , it has been proposed that AP-4 might bind its target sequence even when incorporated into nucleosomes , thereby allowing other transcription factors to bind in a co-operative manner [ 35 ] .
The results of the present study are in agreement with the function of AP-4 being that of a 'nucleating ' protein in the context of the SP6 x promoter .
Here , its function would be to facilitate other protein interactions , rather than being an activator per se .
This is also in agreement with earlier data on the orientation dependency of the pd element , and that the pd element does not synergize with an Spl element [ 16 ] .
It is of interest that AP-4 also bound the pd-E-box in nuclear extracts from a murine plasmacytoma ( $ 194 ) , since this cell line has been used to show that the transcriptional synergy between the pd element and the octamer is specific for cell lines representing late stages of differentiation [ 15 ] .
In conclusion , we have provided evidence that the ubiquitous transcription factor AP-4 is the major E-box ligand within « promoters .
This finding would indicate that there is a division of labour within the Ig loci , where the £24 gene products primarily interact with and regulate enhancer elements , whereas AP-4 would be the primary promoter E-box ligand .
The further consequences of this finding with regard to developmental regulation of the Ig loci and communication between enhancer and promoter elements remain to be clarified .
