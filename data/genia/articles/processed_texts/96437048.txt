Interstitial Deletion Constitutes the Major Mechanism for Loss of Heterozygosity on Chromosome 20q in Polycythemia Vera By Fotios A. Asimakopoutos , James G.R .
Gilbert , Micheala A. Aldred , Thomas C. Pearson , and Anthony R. Green An acquired deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 is a recurrent abnormality in myeloproliferative disorders , particularly polycythemia vera and myelodysplastic syndromes .
The association of 20q deletions with myeloid `` stem cell `` disorders suggests that the deletions mark the site of one or more genes , loss or inactivation of which plays a role in the regulation of normal hematopoietic progenitors .
We have recently performed a detailed molecular analysis of 20q deletions in peripheral blood ( PB ) granulocytes and defined a commonly deleted region of 16 to 21 centimorgan ( cM } .
To further reduce the size of the common deleted region we have searched for small deletions or mitotic recombination events , neither of which would be detected by conventional cytogenetics .
We have studied 48 patients with polycythemia vera and four patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis .
In each case , cytogenetic analysis had either failed or had shown no abnormalities of chromosome 20 .
Seventeen microsatellite markers that span the common deleted region were used to search for loss of heterozygosity in granulocyte DNA .
No instance of microsatellite instability was observed in a total of 880 comparisons of granulocyte and T-cell DNA .
Granulocyte DNA from four patients exhib- CQUIRED DELETIONS of the long arm of chromosome 20 are a recurring abnormality in myeloid hematologic disorders .
They were originally described in polycythemia vera ( PV ) ' and they represent the most common chromosomal abnormality associated with this disorder . ``
However , 20q deletions are also found in other myeloproliferative disorders , `` the myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , °* but typically at lower rates than in polycythemia .
They are rarely reported in association with lymphoid malignancies . ``
This pattern of disease association implies that 20q deletions mark the site of one or more genes , loss or inactivation of which contributes to the dysregulation of hematopoietic progenitors .
We recently performed a detailed cytogenetic and molecular analysis of 20q deletions . ``
Our data showed two classes of deletions : large deletions encompassing both Giemsa positive [ G ( + ) ] bands on 20q and small deletions encompassing only one G ( + ) band .

in each case the allele loss was caused by an interstitial deletion because heterozygosity at distal markers was retained and because quantitative Southern blotting demonstrated hemizygosity .
Loss of heterozygosity in PB granulocytes would be masked by the presence of significant numbers of normal granulocytes not derived from the malignant clone .
Therefore , the human androgen receptor assay ( HUMARA ) was used to determine granulocyte clonality .
In 21 of 27 informative female patients the majority of the granulocytes were clonally derived .
In 5 patients the granulocytes appeared polyclonal and in 1 patient unilateral X inactivation was observed in both granulocytes and T cells .
These results show that , in the vast majority of patients presented here , the failure to detect loss of heterozygosity can not be attributed to the presence of normal polyclonal granulocytes .
Our results therefore show that allele loss on chromosome 20q in polycythemia vera does not commonly involve mitotic recombination or chromosome loss and that microsatellite instability is a rare event in this disorder .

centered on the proximal G ( + ) band , 20q12 .
Microsatellite polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and quantitative Southern blot analysis were subsequently used to characterize 20q deletions in cell lines and peripheral blood ( PB ) granulocytes .
Heterogeneity of both centromeric and telomeric breakpoints was shown , thus supporting the existence of one or more tumor suppressor genes on 20q .
In addition , we defined a common deleted region of 16 to 21 cM which contains ADA , PLCI , TOPI , SEMG1 , and PPGB .
Several candidate tumor suppressor genes were found to lie outside the common deleted region , including SRC , HCK , RBL ] ( p107 ) , PTPN1 , and CEBPB .
Loss of heterozygosity for polymorphic markers is frequently observed in a wide variety of tumors and in several cases has been shown to mark the site of tumor suppressor genes . ``
Loss of heterozygosity can result from several mechanisms including mitotic recombination , gene conver-sion , chromosome deletion , and chromosome nondisjunction with or without reduplication . ``
Different mechanisms account for loss of heterozygosity in different tumors : loss and reduplication of chromosome 13 occurs commonly in retinoblastomas ' `` `` ; whole chromosome loss resulting in mo-nosomy for chromosome 10 occurs frequently in glioblas-toma `` ; whereas mitotic recombination involving chromosomes 17p and 11 is the major mechanism in glioma and rhabdomyosarcoma . ``
Mutations in genes responsible for fidelity of DNA replication and/or repair represent a recently recognized class of genetic alterations in cancer .
The resultant genomic instability can manifest as alterations in the length of simple repeat sequences between tumor and normal tissues . ``

In the only study of microsatellite instability in myeloproliferative disorders , a high incidence was reported in the accelerated and blastic phase but not the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia . ``
Relatively little is known about the role of tumor suppressor genes , including mutator genes , in the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative disorders .
Cytogenetically visible chromosomal deletions [ eg , del ( 20q ) , del ( 13q ) ] are observed in a minority of cases , but the identity of the critical target genes remains obscure .
No studies of loss of heterozygosity in myeloproliferative disorders have been reported .
Neuman et al `` `` examined 60 patients with primary or secondary myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) for loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 5 and 7 .
They found no evidence for loss of heterozygosity other than by major deletion or monosomy .
Similar data were reported by Shepherd et al `` `` in a study investigating loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 5 in MDS .
However , these studies were only able to use a relatively small number of probes , so small regions of loss of heterozygosity may well have been missed .
Moreover , clonality studies were not performed in either of these reports .
Although the precise correlation between genetic and physical distances is not yet clear , the common deleted region clearly spans a large segment of the chromosomal arm .
Therefore , we have attempted to narrow the region of interest by searching for small deletions or mitotic recombination events , neither of which would be detected by conventional cytogenetics .
Patients with a known 20q deletion were ex-cluded .
A high-density map of the common deleted region was constructed and a panel of microsatellite markers mapping to regular intervals across the common deleted region was used to search for chromosome 20q allelic losses .
In addition we used the HUMARA assay `` to show that the majority of PB granulocytes were clonally derived in most informative patients .
Our data demonstrate that microsatellite instability is a rare event and that the main mechanism underlying loss of heterozygosity for 20q sequences in polycythemia vera is interstitial deletion rather than mitotic recombination or chromosome loss .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients .
PB samples from 48 patients with polycythemia vera and 4 patients with primary myelofibrosis were studied .
All samples were obtained from patients attending Addenbrookes Hospital ( Cam-bridge , UK ) or St Thomas 's Hospital .
Diagnosis of polycythemia vera was established according to the Polycythemia Vera Study Group ( PVSG ) criteria .
The median time from diagnosis of polycythemia vera was 8 years ( range , 1 to 28 years ) .
All PV patients except two male patients had received myelosuppressive therapy ( P , busulfan , or hydroxyurea ) .
Two patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis were diagnosed in 1993 , 1 patient in 1992 , and 1 patient in 1991 .
Cell separation .
- Highly purified granulocyte and T-cell fractions were prepared from PB using magnetic beads conjugated to anti-CD15 and anti-CD2 antibodies , respectively ( Dynabeads ; Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) .
Ten to 20 mL of EDTA-anticoagulated blood was layered onto Histopaque 1077 cushions ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) .
Cells from the mononuclear fraction were washed in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1 % bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-CD2 conjugated beads according to manufacturer 's recommendations .
Cells from the granulocyte pellet were similarly processed with anti 2691 cM e 413- D20S106 - D20Ss174 5 -l |- pzos1t0o7 |- PLC1 10 -|- p2os108 CDR - pzost10 | D20sss 15 ©20s46 | pposi89 [ - apa a ) [ - 9208119 |- pzos17 loans “ 25 i~ p20s197 D20S16 3° i- pz0os176 35 40 as |- D20Ss60 |- b20s100 so I- D2os102 Fig 1 .

In each case the percentage of Dynabead-bound cells was determined after each separation procedure using a counting chamber .
This was routinely in the range of 90 % to 100 % .
Cells were suspended in sterile , autoclaved water at a concentration of 10° cells/mL , boiled for 5 minutes , and stored at -80°C until required .
Microsatellite PCR .
Microsatellite PCR was performed essentially as previously described . ``
Briefly , aliquots of 1,250 cells in 12.5 uL of water were amplified in 25 uL of PCR reaction mixtures containing buffer ( 50 mmoV/L KCl , 10 mmol/L Tris HCl pH 8.3 , 1.5 mmol/L MgC ] ; , 0.1 % gelatine ) , dNTPs ( 125 pmol/L each ) , primers ( 25 pmol each ) , and Taq polymerase ( 0.5 U ) .
In each reaction mixture 1/10 of one of the primers was end-labeled with `` P-ATP using polynucleotide kinase .
Samples were amplified in an MJ Research programmable thermal controller ( MJ Research , Watertown , MA ) for 30 cycles ( 94°C for 40 seconds ; annealing temperature for 30 seconds ; no extension step ) with an initial denaturation ( 94°C , 5 minutes ) and a final extension step ( 72°C , 15 minutes ) .
Samples were analyzed on 8 mol/L urea , 6 % polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography .
Primer sequences are available from the Genome Data Base ( GDB ; Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD ) except AFMa132xe9 ( communicated by J. Weissenbach [ Généthon , Paris , France ] on a collaborative basis ) .

Estimation of the percentage of clonal granulocytes .
- Percentages of clonal granulocytes were estimated using granulocyte and T-cell allele intensity ratios .
Granulocyte and T-cell DNA was predigested with Hha I and amplified with HUMARA primers as described above .
Allele ratios were derived by dividing the intensity of one allele ( allele 1 ) by the intensity of the other allele ( allele 2 ) .
In each case , allele ratios were corrected for preferential amplification of alleles by comparison with the equivalent ratios obtained from undigested granulocyte or T-cell DNA , to give granulocyte and T-cell `` corrected ratios , `` ' respectively .
A mixed population of clonal and polyclonal granulocytes consists of a proportion of cells which are clonal ( designated G ) and a proportion of polyclonal cells ( designated Gp ) .
All clonal granulocytes have the same active allele ( eg , allele 1 ) and the same inactive allele ( allele 2 ) .
Only a proportion of the polyclonal granulocytes has the same pattern ( allele 1 active and allele 2 inactive ) .
If this proportion is designated * ' n , `` ' the rest of the polyclonal granulocytes ( `` 1 - n `` ) will have the opposite pattern ( allele 1 inactive and allele 2 active ) .
The value of ' n ' is a measure of the degree of unequal Lyonization in a polyclonal population of cells from a particular patient .
In a mainly clonal population of granulocytes amplification of Hha | predigested DNA will produce a strong and a weak allele .
The weak allele will derive solely from those polyclonal cells that have an allele activity pattern opposite to that of clonal cells .
Its intensity can be represented by [ ( 1 - n ) Gp ] .
The intensity of the strong allele will be derived from both the clonal cells present [ Gc ] together with a contribution from the polyclonal cells that have identical allele activity pattern [ nGp ] .
Therefore , the corrected granulocyte ratio ( R , ; ) will be represented by the following equation : R ; = ( 1 - n ) Gp/nGp + Ge ( equation 1 ) .
The value of » ( degree of unequal Lyonization in a polyclonal population from a particular patient ) can be estimated from the T-cell corrected ratio .
This calculation is based on two premises : O.D .
ratios : SEMG1 O.D .

The T-cell corrected ratio ( Ry ) will be equal to : Rf = ( 1 - n ) Tp/nTp ( equation 2 ) , where n is the proportion of cells that has inactivated allele 2 and 7 , is the proportion of polyclonal T cells .
If all T cells are polyclonal , T » = 1 , and so n can be calculated from Ry .
The value of n derived from equation 2 can now be substituted into the first equation .
If equation 1 is then solved for G , then the following equation can be derived : Ge = Rf - RG/Rr ( Re + 1 ) ( equation 3 ) .
This equation was used to calculate the proportion of clonal granulocytes presented in Table 3 .
DNA extraction and quantitative Southern blotting analysis .
High-molecular-weight DNA was extracted from granulocyte pellets according to standard methods , digested with restriction enzymes , electrophoresed in 0.8 % agarose gels in 1 % TBE , and blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes ( L. Chalfont , Bucks , UK ) using capillary transfer .
The DNA was alkali fixed on the membranes and hybridized to 50 ng of P-labeled probe DNA .
Probes consisted of an ADA 1.2-kb genomic fragment containing exon 4 and pHSg-6X clone ( SEMG1 ) . '
'' A probe from the short arm of chromosome 20 ( p4.8 ) was used for control hybridizations . ``
Membranes were washed at high stringency ( 0.2 % SSC , 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 2 X 15 minutes at room temperature , 1 x 15 minutes at 65 to 68°C ) and exposed to autoradiographic film .
Band intensities on the film were measured using the NIH Image Analysis software vs.1.57 .
The optical density ratio for each marker was calculated by dividing the relevant band density with the band density for the control probe ( p4.8 ) on the same filter .
The resultant values were then normalized by comparison to the optical density ( OD ) ratio obtained after hybridization of the same probes to DNA from the cytogenetically normal KS10 cell line .
RESULTS Construction of a genetic map of the common deleted region .

However , the Généthon map `` `` consisted only of microsatellite markers isolated at Généthon and other maps did not provide good coverage across the entire common deleted region on chromosome 20q .
Therefore , we constructed a high-density genetic map of this region to aid analysis of deletions and loss of heterozygosity in this locality ( Fig 1 ) .
The map was constructed using genotypic data from the Cooperative Human Linkage Center as described by Aldred et al ( submitted ) .
All pairs of loci are supported by odds of at least 250:1 , with the exception of D20S§17-D208119 where the odds against inversion are only 20:1 .
There are no inconsistencies between this and other published genetic maps .

The unpublished Généthon microsatellite AFMa132xe9 has been included to provide a marker between D20S119 and D20S17 .
In addition , we included four loci ( D20860 , D20S100 , D20S102 , PCK ] ) that map to 20q13.2 in the vicinity of a unique deletion in a case of AML M4Eo reported by Roulston et al . ``
Our results are summarized in Table 1 and Fig 2 .
The vast majority of patients did not display loss of heterozygosity for any of the 20q markers used ( Fig 2A ) .
However , allele loss over large regions of chromosome 20q was found in 4 patients , all with polycythemia vera .
Complete or near complete loss of one allele was seen in 3 patients ( Fig 2B ) whereas in 1 patient the intensity of one allele was consistently reduced ( Fig 2C ) .
The results in the latter patient suggest the presence of a minor subpopulation of granulocytes with no loss of heterozygosity on 20q .
In each of the 4 patients , the region involved was extensive ( Table 2 ) .
The distal breakpoint was determined in all 4 patients .
Precise centromeric breakpoints were not defined 2695 but were proximal to PLC ] in all 4 cases .
Retention of heterozygosity for at least one distal marker in each patient showed that the mechanism responsible for loss of heterozygosity in all 4 patients did not involve whole chromosome loss or simple mitotic recombination .
Our data also provide insight into the prevalence of microsatellite instability in polycythemia vera .
Seventeen loci were examined in both granulocyte and T-cell samples from 52 patients ( including the 4 patients with primary myelofi-brosis ) with the exceptions shown in Table 2 .
Thus , a total of 880 separate comparisons between granulocyte and T-cell DNA were performed .
No instance of microsatellite instability was observed , thus demonstrating the rarity of the process in polycythemia vera .
Loss of heterozygosity resulted from simple interstitial deletion .
- The results obtained in the 4 patients who exhibited loss of heterozygosity were consistent with either interstitial deletion or complex mitotic recombination events .
Therefore , quantitative Southern blotting was used to distinguish between these possibilities .
The results of these experiments appear in Fig 3 .
In all four patients the OD ratios obtained using two probes ( ADA and SEMG1 ) from the region of allele loss ' `` were approximately half that of the normal controls .
The same results were obtained for both probes in a second independent experiment .
These data show that granulocyte DNA from all 4 patients was hemizygous for ADA and SEMG1 , a finding that indicates the presence of an interstitial deletion and not mitotic recombination .
Analysis of clonality using the HUMARA assay .
- Loss of heterozygosity in PB granulocytes would be masked by the presence of significant numbers of normal granulocytes not derived from the malignant clone .
Moreover , a minority of patients with myeloproliferative disorders have been reported to have polyclonal granulocytes . ``
To ascertain to what extent this phenomenon may have impaired our ability to detect loss of heterozygosity , we assessed the clonality of granulocytes from our female patients .
It was decided to use the HUMARA assay because of its high rate of heterozygosity and consistent patterns of methylation .
`` * `` `` We developed a method for calculating the percentage of clonal cells present in a population of granulocytes ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The percentage of clonal granulocytes is calculated from the granulocyte corrected ratio by using the T-cell corrected ratio to indicate the degree of unequal Lyonization in that patient .
To use the allelic ratios to estimate the proportion of clonal cells , it was essential to prove that the conditions used for HUMARA PCR resulted in amplification within the linear range .
To test the linearity of the PCR conditions , DNA from a cell line derived from a heterozygous female was digested with Rsa I , which leaves the region between HUMARA primers intact .
PCR using Rsa I1-digested DNA should result in amplification of both alleles .
A second aliquot was digested with Rsa I and Hha I , and resulted in amplification of only one allele .
DNA from the Rsa I-digested sample was mixed at 10 % increments with DNA from the Rsa UHha I-digested aliquot ( Fig 4A ) .
Fifty-four nanograms of resultant mixes ( corresponding to the amount of DNA from 10,000 diploid cells `` ) was amplified using the conditions described in Materials and Methods .

HUMARA analysis of patient samples .
DNA was extracted from highly purified PB granulocytes and T cells and amplified using HUMARA primers with ( + ) or without ( - ) predigestion with the methylation sensitive enzyme HMha I .
( A ) Patient MD .
Monoclonality of granulocytes but not T cells in this patient is inferred by the disappearance of one allele after digestion of granulocyte but not T-cell DNA with Hha I .
( B ) Patient JM .
Neither granulocyte nor T-cell DNA displayed allele-specific digestion with Hha I , suggesting that both cell types are polyclonal .
( C ) Patient PS .
Allele-specific digestion of granulocyte but not T-cell DNA from a patient with two HUMARA alleles separated by one trinucleotide repeat .
For an explanation of similar patterns , see the study by Hughes . ``
( D ) Patient SS .
Allele-specific digestion of both granulocyte and T-cell DNA from a patient with two HUMARA alleles separated by one trinucleotide repeat .
Densitometric analysis of the results showed that the intensity of the upper allele exhibited a linear relationship with the percentage of Hha I-digested DNA in the sample ( Fig 4B ) .
All female patients ( n = 31 ) were included in the HUMARA clonality analysis ( the remainder 21 patients were male ) .
Three of these patients had idiopathic myelofibrosis ( patients HP , DR , DH ) and the rest had polycythemia vera .
Four of the 31 patients were homozygous and therefore unin-formative .
Of the remaining 27 patients , 21 displayed well-separated alleles , the intensity of which could be analyzed by densitometry ( see Table 3 ) .
An allele intensity ratio of 1:3 has previously been used as a practical ( albeit arbitrary ) threshold for assessing the clonality of tumor cell popula-tions . ``
'' `` ' If there is random X-chromosome inactivation ( T-cell allele ratio = 1 ) , a granulocyte allele ratio of 1:3 would correspond to 50 % clonal granulocytes .
In 17 of 21 informative patients that were assessed densitometrically , the proportion of clonal granulocytes exceeded 50 % ( Fig 5A ) .
In 4 patients most or all of the granulocytes appeared polyclonal ( Fig 5B ) .
Six patients exhibited alleles too similar in size to allow accurate densitometric analysis , and so the autoradiographs were assessed visually .
In 4 of these patients ( including the 2 female patients with loss of heterozygosity for 20q markers ) preferential digestion of one allele was clearly observed in granulocytes but not T cells ( Fig 5C ) .
In one patient no preferential allele loss was seen in either granulocytes or T cells ( polyclonal pattern ) and in the remaining patient preferential allele loss was seen in both granulocytes and T cells ( `` skewed `` ' pattern ) ( Fig 5D ) .
This result would be consistent with either skewed Lyonization or the production of both granulocytes and T cells by the malignant progenitors in this patient .
Taken together , our results show that the majority of granulocytes were clonally derived in 21 of 27 informative patients and were mostly polyclonal in 5 patients .
Therefore , our data suggest that in most patients the failure to detect loss of heterozygosity for loci on chromosome 20q did not reflect masking by normal granulocytes .
DISCUSSION In this report we have searched for loss of heterozygosity within the common deleted region on chromosome 20q in samples from 48 patients with polycythemia vera and 4 patients with primary myelofibrosis .
Seventeen microsatellite markers spaced at approximately 1- to 3-cM intervals were used .
Only four samples displayed loss of heterozygosity and in each case the underlying mechanism was a previously undetected interstitial deletion .
These results show that in polycythemia vera , as in MDS , mitotic recombination is rare .
Chromosome 20 is a small chromosome and the detection of small deletions using conventional cytogenetics is technically demanding .
Therefore , it has been proposed that small submicroscopic deletions may exist but escape detection .
Our data suggest that such deletions are , in fact , rare .
One possible explanation would be the presence of widely spaced hotspots for chromosome breakage .
However , this seems unlikely because there is considerable heterogeneity of both centromeric and telomeric breakpoints . '
'' Moreover , it should be emphasized that our data do not exclude the existence of very small deletions ( < 1 to 3 cM ) which would be beyond the resolution of this study .
One potential reason for our failure to detect loss of heterozygosity in most patients might have been the presence of significant numbers of polyclonal normal granulocytes .
Gilliland et al `` `` reported PB granulocytes that were polyclonal in one of three patients with polycythemia vera .
More MECHANISMS FOR LOH ON CHROMOSOME 20q over , in further studies , total PB leukocytes or bone marrow nucleated cells gave nonclonal patterns in 2 of 26 patients with polycythemia . ``
The presence of significant numbers of polyclonal granulocytes would mask loss of heterozygosity occurring in a subpopulation of clonally derived granulocytes .
Previous mixing experiments have assessed the sensitivity of microsatellite PCR for the detection of a deletion carried by a subpopulation of cells .
These studies showed that visual inspection of autoradiographs could detect reduced intensity of one allele if the deletion were present in = > 40 % of these cells . ``
Therefore , it was important to assess the clonality of PB granulocytes in our patients .
To address this issue we have used the HUMARA assay to estimate the proportion of clonally derived granulocytes in all female patients included in this study .
Five of 27 informative patients exhibited polyclonal granulocytes .
In 21 of these informative patients , at least 50 % of the granulocytes were clonally derived .
These results show that , in the majority of patients presented here , the failure to detect loss of heterozygosity can not be attributed to the presence of normal polyclonal granulocytes .
One patient , in whom densitometric analysis of results was not possible , displayed unilateral patterns of X inactivation in both granulocytes and T cells .
Unilateral X inactivation of T-cell DNA may reflect skewed Lyonization or involvement of T cells in the malignant clone .
Previous reports have shown monoclonal derivation of PB leukocytes in 24 of 26 patients with polycythemia vera . ``
'' `` `` `` `` However , in view of the heterogeneity of X inactivation patterns in different tissues , `` it has been shown that it is important to use T cells as a control to exclude skewed Lyonization . ``
'' Before this report , purified granulocytes and T cells have been studied in only a few pa-tients .
`` `` `` * `` Granulocytes were clonal and T cells polyclonal in 10 patients , both granulocytes and T cells were polyclonal in 1 patient , and a skewed pattern was seen in both granulocytes and T cells in 1 patient .
Two additional patients reported by Gilliland et al `` `` demonstrated unilateral X inactivation of purified granulocytes but the clonality of lymphoid cells was not studied .
In none of these reports was an attempt made to estimate the proportion of clonal cells .
In the work reported here , no difference in the size of the microsatellite alleles amplified from granulocytes and T cells was detected in a total of 880 separate comparisons .
Therefore , our data show that genetic instability is extremely rare in PV .
There is relatively little information available about microsatellite instability in hematologic malignancies .
In a study of 21 patients with lymphomas and acute leukemias , both lymphoblastic and myeloid , using 10 microsatellite markers , `` microsatellite instability was only demonstrated in one case of AML and two patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies ( Burkitt 's lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ) .
Kaneko et al `` `` reported 6 patients with MDS , two of whom exhibited microsatellite instability at 4 of 4 loci , whereas this was not observed in the other 4 patients , even using samples obtained after leukemic evolu-tion .
Furthermore , in chronic myeloid leukemia , a high incidence of genetic instability has been reported in the accelerated and blastic phase but not the chronic phase of the disease . ``
2697 In summary , our data show that allele loss on chromosome 20q in patients with PV does not commonly involve mitotic recombination or chromosome loss and that microsatellite instability is extremely rare in this disorder .
In addition , the HUMARA assay was used to show that most PB granulocytes were clonal in the majority of female patients and so the failure to detect loss of heterozygosity can not be attributed to the presence of normal polyclonal granulocytes .
