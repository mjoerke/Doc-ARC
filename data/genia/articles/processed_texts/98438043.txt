[ CANCER RESEARCH 58 , 4282-4287 , October 1 , 1998 ] Advances in Brief Tumor Suppressor Proteins as Regulators of Cell Differentiation Zhan-Rong Li , Rosemary Hromchak , Anuradha Mudipalli , and Alexander Bloch Roswell Park Cancer Institute , Buffalo , New York 14263 Abstract The products of the tumor suppressor genes are considered to function as specific inhibitors of tumor cell growth .
In this communication , we present evidence to show that these proteins inhibit tumor cell proliferation by participating in the activation of tumor cell differentiation .
The ML-1 human myeloblastic leukemia cells used in this study proliferate when treated with insulin-like growth factor I and transferrin but differentiate to monocytes when exposed to tumor necrosis factor a or transforming growth factor B1 , or to macrophage-like cells when treated with both these cytokines .
Initiation of proliferation but not of differentiation was followed by a 20- to 25-fold increase in the nuclear level of the DNA polymerase-associated processivity factor PCNA and of the proliferation-specific transcription factor E2F1 .
In contrast , induction of differentiation but not of proliferation was followed by a 25- to 30-fold increase in the nuclear level of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 ( wild type ) , pRb , and p130/Rb2 and of the p53-dependent cyclin kinase inhibitor p21/Cip1 .
p53 and p21/Cip1 , respectively , inhibit the expression and activation of PCNA , whereas p130 and pRb , respectively , inhibit the expression and activation of E2F1 .
As a result , G , -S-associated DNA and mRNA synthesis is inhib-ited , growth uncoupled from differentiation , and maturation enabled to proceed .
Where this function of the tumor suppressor proteins is impaired , the capacity for differentiation is lost , which leads to the sustained proliferation that is characteristic of the cancer cell .
Introduction Functionally mature cells that are formed in the tissues of an organism derive from primitive stem cells that , along discrete stages of development , differentiate to their fully mature state .
The proportion of proliferating and differentiating cells that are present at intermediate stages of the maturation path is tightly regulated to assure a balanced supply of functionally competent cells .
Regulation of this supply is mediated by cytokines produced by cells that are part of the maturation sequence itself or that belong to functionally related developmental paths .
If maturation is permanently arrested at an intermediate stage of the developmental sequence without concomitant inhibition of cell proliferation , a population of morphologically and functionally immature `` cancer `` cells accumulates , which interferes with the normal functioning of the affected organism .
Numerous mechanisms that underlie such oncogenic transformation have been identified .
They predominantly involve alterations in proliferation-related signal transduction , which lead to sustained cell growth without cell differentiation ( 1 ) .
Tumor suppressor proteins have been shown to be capable of abolishing such sustained growth by interfering with cell cycle progression , such interference having been considered to form a specific surveillance mechanism ( 2 ) .
However , in this study , we provide evidence to show that the inhibition of tumor Received 5/20/98 ; accepted 8/13/98 .

Cell Cultures .
ML-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FBS .
Cultures containing 5 X 10° cells/ml were grown in this medium for 3 days at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere .
Fresh medium was then added to reduce the cell number to the starting concentration .
To perform the assays described , the cells were synchronized in G , , by incubation for 3 days in RPMI 1640 containing 0.05 % FBS .
After washing with serum-free RPMI 1640 , 5 X 10° cells/ml were suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5 % FBS , which was added to preserve their viability during the prolonged ( 70 h ) assay period .
Proliferation of the cells was initiated by treatment with 40 ng/ml IGF-I plus 0.5 ug/ml Tf ; monocytic differentiation was induced with 60 ng/ml TGF-B1 or with 20 units/ml TNF-a ; and macrophage-like cells were obtained by adding 10 ng/ml TGF-B1 together with 10 units/ml TNF-a .
The number of cells obtained under these conditions was counted by hemocytometer and their viability assayed by trypan blue exclusion ; the extent of differentiation was assessed by determining the mature phenotype .

DIFFERENTIATION REGULATORS supernatant-designated the nuclear extract-was frozen and stored at -70°C .
Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation .
The levels of p130 , p53 , pRB , p21/Cip , PCNA , and E2F1 in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were assayed by Western blotting , and immune complexes were detected by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting ( 8 ) .
Briefly , nuclear or cytoplasmic extract ( 300 ug of protein ) was added to 300 pl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl ( pH 7.4 ) , 150 mm NaCl , 0.5 % NP4Q , 20 mm EDTA , 0.1 mM Na ; VO , , 50 mm NaF , 1 mm PMSF , 1 mm benzamidine , 10 g/m ] trypsin inhibitor , 20 ug/ml leupeptin , and 20 ug/ml aprotinin .
To each sample , 1.5 ug of the desired affinity-purified antibody was added .
After rotating at 4°C for 1 h , 40 wl of immobilized protein A was added to each sample , and rotation continued overnight .
Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation , and after washing , the immunecomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting as described above .
Measurement of DNA Synthesis and Rapidly Turning-over mRNA .
DNA synthesis was determined by methyl- [ °HJthymidine incorporation ( 8 ) .
Rapidly turning over mRNA was measured as described previously ( 9 ) .
Briefly , cells were labeled for 1 h with 5- [ *HJuridine ( 20 uCi/ml , 23.6 Ci/mmol ) , and RNA was extracted with a concentrated solution of Nal , mRNA being selectively bound to nitrocellulose paper .
H-labeled mRNA was then counted by liquid scintillation spectrometer .
EMSA .
For determining p53 binding to the PCNA promoter , PCNA promoter DNA was cut with HindIII , and the segment -272 to -46 was isolated as described ( 6 ) .
The fragment was end-labeled with *°P using T4 polynucle-otide kinase .
Binding reactions were carried out using 10 ug of nuclear protein and the labeled PCNA promoter DNA fragment ( 50,000 cpm ) in binding buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 50 mm NaCl , 1 mm DTT , 1 mM EDTA , 0.5 % ( viv ) glycerol , and 1.5 ug poly ( dI-dC ) in a final volume of 25 wl .
The reactions were carried out at room temparature for 30 min .
The samples were electrophoresed at 175 V on 5 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.5 m Tris-borate/EDTA buffer .
Specificity of binding was confirmed by the addition of 50 % unlabeled probe .
p53 in the complex was identified by incubating the reaction mixtures with 1.5 ug of anti-p53 antibody for 30 min ( supershift reaction ) .
EMSA was also used to determine p130-E2F1 promoter binding .
The pGL3 E2F1 promoter DNA ( 7 ) was digested with Eagl , and the 101-bp segment-purified by agarose gel-was end-labeled with *°P .
Specificity of binding was confirmed by adding 75 % unlabeled probe to the reaction mixture , and antibody to p130 was used to detect the presence of p130 in the complex .
Effect of Antisense Oligonucleotides of p53 , p130 , and pRb on ML-1 Cell Differentiation .
Ten , 5 , and 20 ug , respectively , of the antisense oligonucleotides to p53 , p130 , and pRb were incubated with 2 pl superFect at 37°C for 15 min , diluted with 100 pl of serum-free medium , and added to 1 mi of cell suspension ( 5 X 10° cells/ml ) containing 10 ng/ml TGF-B1 and 10 units/ml TNF-a .
Corresponding sense oligonucleotides were used as controls .
After 2 days of incubation , the cell number was counted and the extent of differentiation determined .
Results and Discussion ML-1 human myeloblastic leukemia cells ( 10 ) , suspended in se-rum-depleted RPMI 1640 , proliferate when treated with IGF-I plus Tf ( Fig .
1a ) but differentiate to monocytes when exposed to TGF-BI1 ( Fig .
1b ) or to TNF-a ( not shown ) .
Macrophage-like cells are formed when these two cytokines are applied jointly ( Fig .
lc ) .
By adding 0.5 % FBS to these cultures , their long-term ( > 48 h ) viability is enhanced without their maturation status being affected .
When treated with 60 ng/ml of TGF-B1 or with 20 units/ml of TNF-a , ~85-90 % of the cells convert to monocytes ( Fig .
16 ) .
When both these cytokines are applied ( 10 ng/ml TGF-B1 and 10 units/ml TNFa ) , 90-95 % of the cells mature to macrophage-like cells ( Fig .
1c ) .
Stimulation of proliferation leads the cell population to double after approximately 70 h of incubation ( Fig .
14 ) , whereas induction of differentiation results in cessation of cell growth .
Because the 0.5 % amount of FBS that is added to the RPMI 1640 to enhance viability contains a small amount of IGF-I and Tf , ~15 % -20 % of the cells in controls are able to proliferate ( Fig .
14 ) .
This amount of FBS does not affect the number of differentiation-induced cells .
Because induction of ML-1 cell differentiation is accompanied by proliferation arrest at the G , -S border ( 8 ) , we began an examination of the mechanisms by which this proliferation-arrest is regulated .
We , first , focused our attention on the expression of PCNA ( 11 ) and E2F1 ( 12 ) , two key mediators of the proliferation-associated G , -S transit .
Because the level of these mediators , like that of other regulatory proteins , varies as the cells progress along the cell cycle , all cell populations used in these assays were synchronized in G , by serum depletion ( 13 ) .
This modification assured that the results obtained derived from an essentially homogeneous cell population , rather than from mixed populations containing cells present at multiple stages of cell growth or differentiation .
Because such regulatory proteins can be present at different levels and in different molecular forms in nuclei as compared to cytoplasm , separation of the two compartments was also carried out routinely to allow an accurate assessment of the site ( s ) at which these proteins exert their primary activity unimpeded by artifacts that may result from intermixing the components of different cell compartments .
Employing these assay conditions , we found that , as shown in Fig .
2a , the level of the PCNA was low in the cytoplasm of control as well as of proliferation- and differentiation-induced ML-1 cells .
In contrast , as shown in Fig .
2b , an approximately 20-fold increase in the level of PCNA occurred in the nuclei of proliferation-stimulated cells .

In keeping with the determinant role PCNA plays in DNA synthesis ( 11 ) , the pronounced difference in the level at which this protein was expressed in growth versus differentiation ( Fig .
2b ) was reflected in the extent to which DNA synthesis took place in proliferation-stimulated as compared to control cells or to differentiation-induced cells ( Fig .
2¢c ) .
Extensive DNA synthesis occurred only in growth-induced cells but not in control or in differentiation-induced cells .
In parallel with PCNA , the transcription factor E2F1 was present at only a very low level in the cytoplasm of control as well as of growth-and differentiation-induced cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
In contrast , this transcription factor was expressed at a high level in the nuclei of proliferation-induced cells ( Fig , 2¢ ) , its concentration being low in the nuclei of control and of differentiation-stimulated cells .
EZF1 regulates the transcription of various genes required for the proliferation-associated G , - $ transit ( 12 ) , and the difference in level at which E2F1 is present in growth as compared to differentiation is , thus , expected to affect the extent of transcription that ensues .
As shown in Fig .
2f , E2F1-mediated mRNA synthesis was , indeed , high in growth and very low in differentiation .
These data were in agreement with previous findings demonstrating that PCNA and E2F1 serve , respectively , as determinants of DNA and mRNA synthesis required for the proliferation-associated cell cycle transit from G , to S-phase .
Their lack of expression in differentiation , thus , provided a mechanistic basis for the absence of the G , -S transit in the maturation process .
This recognition raised questions , concerning the mechanisms by which the expression and activation of PCNA and E2F1 was regulated .
As summarized in Fig .
3 , various reports had shown that the level and activity of PCNA and E2F1 is controlled by diverse tumor suppressor proteins .
Thus , wild-type p53 , present in ML-1 cells ( 14 ) , was reported able to interfere with PCNA synthesis by repressing the PCNA promoter ( 15-17 ) .
p53 was also shown capable of regulating the expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p21/Cipl/Waf/l via a 10 20 30 40 50 50 p 1q 20 30 40 50 60 Time ( h ) binding site in the p21 promoter ( 18 ) .
p21/Cip1 , in turn , was observed able to inhibit DNA replication by direct binding to PCNA ( 19-21 ) , and by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases ( 22-25 ) .
In parallel , the tumor suppressor protein p130/Rb2 was found capable of inhibiting transcription from the E2F1 promoter ( 7 ) , whereas the pRB was observed able to inhibit the E2Fl-dependent transactivation of S-phase genes by direct binding to E2F1 ( 26-28 ) .
The in vitro demonstration that these tumor suppressor proteins can down-regulate the expression and activation of PCNA and E2F1 in a concentration-dependent manner suggested that , in intact cells , they may act in a parallel manner .
That expectation was borne out by the data shown in Fig .
4 .
The tumor suppressor protein p53 ( Fig .
4 , a and b ) , its auxiliary factor p21/Cipl ( Fig .
4 , c and d ) , and the tumor suppressor protein pRb ( Fig .
4 , g and A ) , were all expressed at 20- to 30-fold elevated levels in the nuclei of differentiation-induced cells , remaining at very low levels in the nuclei of control and of proliferation-stimulated cells .
p21 deviated from this pattern by the fact that its level was also increased to a significant extent in the cytoplasm of | a 0 -- -- Cbonn ) -- ) Fig .

That complexation correlates with the high level of p130 that , at this time interval , is found present in the nuclei of differentiation-induced cells ( Fig .
4f ) .
The elevated levels of p130 that were present in control cells and in proliferation-stimulated cells at early time points ( 0-15 h ; Fig .
4f ) , likely account for the significant extent of complexation between p130 and E2FI1 that occurred at these time points ( Fig .
5b-7 ) in growth-induced as well as in differentiation-induced cells .
It seems that early transcription from the E2F1 promoter is suppressed in both growth and differentiation with growth-associated E2F1 expression being allowed only at later time points , when the p130 concentration declines to a low level ( Fig .
4f versus Fig .
2e ) .
Analogous to the differentiation-associated inhibition of the PCNA promoter by p53 and of the E2F1 promoter by p130 , direct binding of p21/Cip !
to PCNA ( Fig .
5¢c ) and of pRb to E2F1 ( Fig .
5d ) occurred only in differentiation-induced cells , such binding contributing to the inhibition of G , -S-associated DNA synthesis and transcription ( Fig .
2 , c and f ; Refs .
6 , 7 , 24-26 ) .
To gain additional experimental support for the regulatory role that tumor suppressor proteins are indicated to play in the process of cell differentiation , sense and antisense oligonucleotides of p53 , p130 , and pRb were added to ML-1 cells untreated ( control ) or treated with the DFs TGF-B1 and TNF- « .
As shown in Fig .
6 , a significant reduction in the number of differentiated cells was obtained only in the presence of the antisense oligonucleotides of p53 , p130 , and pRb , with their number being decreased by 44 , 68 , and 63 % , respectively .
No significant changes in the number of differentiated cells occurred in cultures treated with the coresponding sense oligonucleotides .
In the absence of DF , the cells did not respond to treatment with antisense oligonu-cleotides , which supports the indication that their action pertains to the differentiation process .
By participating in the inhibition of the PCNA-dependent and E2F1-dependent G , -S transit , the tumor suppressor proteins are indicated to uncouple growth from differentiation ( 32 ) , allowing entry into the maturation path .
Where this function of the tumor suppressor proteins is impaired , sustained proliferation at a stage of incomplete maturation is expected to ensue , that condition being a prime characteristic of the cancer cell .
