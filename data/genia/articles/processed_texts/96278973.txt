# ] From { INSERM U429 , Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades , 149 rue de Sevres , 75743 Paris Cedex 15 and ( CNRS UMR 146 , Institut Curie , Section de Recherche , Centre Universitaire , Batiment 110 , 91405 Orsay Cedex , France The y¢ chain is a subunit of multiple cytokine receptors ( interleukin ( IL ) -2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , and IL-15 ) , the expression of which is restricted to hematopoietic lin-eages .
A defect in yc leads to the X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by a block in T cell differentiation .
In order to better characterize the human ye promoter and define the minimal tissue-specific promoter region , progressive 5'-deletion constructs of a segment extending 1053 base pairs upstream of the major transcription start site were generated and tested for promoter activity in various hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types .
The -1053/+34 construct allowed promoter activity only in cells of hematopoietic origin , and tissue specificity was conserved in all other constructs tested .
The region downstream of -90 appeared critical for basal promoter activity .
It contains two potential Ets binding sites conserved in the murine ye promoter gene , one of which was found essential for functional promoter activity as determined by mutational analysis .
The functional Ets binding site was found to bind Ets family proteins , principally GA-binding protein and Elf-1 and could be transactivated by GABPa and -B synergistically .
These results indicate that , as already reported for the IL2RB promoter , GA-binding protein is an essential component of yc basal promoter activity .
Although GABP expression is not restricted to the hematopoietic lineage , its interaction with other specific factors may contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the yc gene .
The common y ( yc ) chain that functions as a subunit of the receptors for IL-2 `` ( 1 ) , IL-4 ( 2 , 3 ) , IL-7 ( 4-5 ) , IL-9 ( 6 ) , and IL-15 ( 7 ) is a pivotal molecule of the immune system .
A functional defect of yc chain leads to the X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID X1 ) ( 8 ) .
SCID X1 patients develop severe and persistent infections resulting in failure to thrive and early death in the absence of curative bone marrow transplantation .

SCID X1 is characterized by defective T lymphocyte and natural killer cell ( NK ) differentiation , whereas B cells appeared principally affected in their functions ( reviewed in Ref .
9 ) .
yc chain is thus critically involved in the proliferation and functional differentiation of these cells .
yc chain expression appears restricted to the hematopoietic lineages ( 1 ) .
It was shown to be expressed at the surface of all peripheral lymphocyte popula-tions , of NK cells , of monocytes , and of granulocytes ( 10 ) .
During T cells ontogeny , the yc chain is detected at all stages of differentiation ( 11 , 12 ) .
ye chain appeared constitutively expressed but expression can be modulated by different factors .
In T cells , yc gene promoter activity was found to be enhanced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and phytohemagglu-tinin A stimulation while decreased by IL-2 ( 13 ) .
In contrast to T cells , fresh human monocytes were reportedly enhanced for IL2Ry expression by either IL2 or interferon-y stimulation , but this enhancement results from ye mRNA stabilization ( 14 ) .
To better understand the mechanisms and factors involved in the regulation of ye chain expression , studies of the transcriptional regulatory region were initiated .
In this report we show that the 5 ' regulatory region of yc chain gene contains multiple potential Ets binding sites ( EBS ) and that one of the EBS present in the region , recently shown to be critical for basal promoter activity ( 13 ) , is necessary and sufficient for tissue-specific expression .
This EBS interacts in vitro with two major factors of the Ets family of DNA binding proteins ( 15 , 16 ) , the GA-binding protein ( GABP ) , which also functions as transacti-vator in cotransfection assays , and Elf-1 , which therefore may play crucial roles in regulating ye promoter activity .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines-The cell lines utilized in this study were the human Burkitt lymphoma Raji cell line , the human T cell leukemia Jurkat cell line , IARC 301.5 which is a subclone from a cell line derived from a human T lymphoma ( 17 , 18 ) , the myelogenous leukemia K562 cell line , YT 12 881-a subclone from the human NK-like cell line ( YT-was obtained from D. K. Smith ( 19 ) ) , the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1 , the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep-G2 , human fibroblasts , and an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell line from two normal human subjects , and the human epithelioma cell line Helia .
All the cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum except for the HeLa cell line which was cultured in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum .
DNA Sequence Analysis-ye genomic DNA was isolated from screening of an X chromosome enriched cosmid library gridded onto nylon filter ( 20 ) using a full-length human ye cDNA .
ye genomic sequence was determined by direct cosmid sequencing using *°P-labeled oligonucleotides and the CircumVent Thermal cycle dideoxy DNA sequencing kit from New England Biolabs ( Beverly , MA ) and synthetic primers ( Genset , Paris , France ) .
Sequences of primers used in this study are available on request .
The numbering of all oligonucleotides and sequences in this paper is based on assigning the major transcription site as +1 , identified by primer extension and ribonuclease protection assays ( 21 ) .
14849 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 14850 Vectors-T'wo plasmids with reporter genes were used , the promoterless pGI2 basic vector ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , carrying the luciferase reporter gene ( 22 ) , and the pRSV-CAT plasmid ( Rous sarcoma virus CAT plasmid ) , which carries the CAT gene under the control of a Rous sarcoma long terminal repeat promoter ( 23 ) , was also included in all transfection experiments to correct for variations in transfection effi-ciencies .
The GABPa , GABPB cDNAS ( a generous gift of Drs .
Brown and Mc Knight ) , and the Elf-1 cDNA ( a generous gift of Dr. Leiden ) have been inserted at the EcoRI site of the SV40 promoter-based AEB expression plasmid ( 24 ) .
Plasmid Constructs-DNA constructs including varying parts of 5'-flanking region of the yc chain gene were generated as follows .
The amplification of the promoter sequences was performed by polymerase chain reaction using total genomic DNA between the lower 26-mer-synthesized oligonucleotide primer for the common 3 `` end at +34 ( CLP2 5 ' GGG GTA CCC GCT TGC TCT TCA TTC CC 3° ) and one of the following upper 26-mer oligonucleotide primers in order to generate a series of various truncated 5 ' ends of the construct : 1053 CLP1 , 5 GGG GTA CCA GGA TGT CTT GTT GGT CT 35 ; 754 CLP1 , 5 GGG GTA CCA GAA GCA GAG TGG GTT AT 3 ' ; 292 CLP1 , 55 GGG GTA CCG AGG AGA AGG TGG TTG AG 3 ' ; 166 CLP1 55 GGG GTA CCA CAG CAG CAC CTA ATC TC 3 `` ; 117 CLP1 , 55 GGG GTA CCT ATT TGC CAC ACC CTC TG 3 `` ; 90 CLP1 5° GGG GTA CCG GTT TAT AAG GTT CTT TC 3 ' ; 44 CLP1 , 5'GGG GTA CCT GGG TGG GGA GGG GTA GT 3 .
The amplified polymerase chain reaction products were then gel-purified , digested with the KpnI enzyme , and cloned into the KpnI site of the promoterless pGI2 basic vector upstream of the luciferase reporter gene .
The seven constructs are denoted in the study as -1053/+84 , -754/ +84 , -292/+834 , -166/+34 , -117/+834 , -90/+84 , and -44/+34 .
The names of each plasmid construct include the borders of the inserted DNA fragments in base pairs relative to the major transcription site .
The correct sequence and good orientation of the inserts were verified by double-stranded dideoxy sequence analysis .
Transfections-Except for Hela cells , all DNA transfection experiments were performed by electroporation ( 25 ) using the Cellject apparatus ( Eurogentec , Belgium ) .
A double pulse was applied to the cells .
The first pulse was 800-1100 V , 740 , and 40 microfarads which resulted in a tissue constant of 800-850 us .
The second pulse was 150-250 V , 740 , with a capacitance of 2100 microfarads and led to a tissue constant of 40 ms. All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 , 10 % fetal calf serum and were diluted 2-fold in culture medium 18 h prior to transfection .
Before electroporation , the exponentially growing cells were collected by centrifugation after trypsinization if required ( adherent cells ) and resuspended at 25 X 10°/ml in culture medium for cells in suspension and at 10 % 10°/ml for adherent cells .
0.4 ml of the cell suspension was mixed with 10 pg of the plasmid DNA plus 2.5 ug of the pRSV-CAT transfection efficiency control , both plasmids purified by two CsCl gradient centrifugation , electroporated in cuvettes with a 0.4-cm gap between electrodes , and rapidly diluted to 1.1 X 10° cells/ml in culture medium .
Cultures were returned to 37 °C , 5 % CO , for 18 h. Hela cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium containing 10 % of fetal calf serum .
For transfection experiments , Helia cells were seeded at 1.5 x 10° cells/100-mm Petri dish and cotransfected 24 h later with 0.5 ug of reporter plasmid and the indicated amounts of expression plasmids , using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method ( 26 ) .
When the activities of different doses of expression plasmids were compared , the total amount of expression vector was kept constant by addition of the control expression plasmid AEB .
After addition of the DNA , the plates were kept at 37 °C , 5 % CO , for 20 h. Cell medium was changed and then the plates were left undisturbed until the time for harvest 24 h later .
Cells were harvested by pipetting , washed once with phosphate-buffered saline , and resuspended in 100 ul of lysis buffer ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
Cell Extracts and Luciferase Assays-Eighteen hours following transfection , nonadherent cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 1 X and resuspended in 100 pl of lysis buffer ( Promega , Madison ) .
Adherent cells were first trypsinized before washing the cells and then lysed after 15 min at room temperature .
In order to increase luciferase activity ( up to 20 % ) in cell extracts , cells were subjected to one cycle of freezing on dry ice after 15 min at room temperature and thawed at room temperature .
The lysates were clarified from insoluble material ( debris ) by a 2-min centrifugation at 1800 % g at 4°C , and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube .
The luciferase activity in the supernatant * Anne Gégonne , R. Bosselut , and J. Ghysdael , unpublished data .
Regulation of ye Gene Promoter Activity by Ets Products remained unaltered during storage for several days at -20 °C .
The resulting extracts were then assayed for CAT activity in order to normalize the transfection efficiency .
CAT assays were performed using butyryl coenzyme A ( Sigma ) and `` ' C-labeled chloramphenicol ( ICN , Orsay , France ) .
After 1 h at 37 °C , the butyrylated chloramphenicol was extracted with 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane/xylenes ( 2:1 , v/v ) and counted in a scintillation counter .
For the luciferase assay , 1-20 pl of each extract depending on CAT assay results were diluted into QSP 20-ul lysis buffer and mixed with 100 pl of ATP and luciferin in a scintillation vial .
After a 7-s incubation , light emission was monitored over 1 min on the standard radioactivity channel of the scintillation counter Tri-Carb 4000 ( United Technologies , Packard ) after disabling the coincidence circuit .
Background activity was measured with lysis buffer , ATP , and luciferin and ranged 30,000-60,000 cpm .
Background values were subtracted from sample values .
RNA Preparation-Total cellular RNA was prepared from cells using the guanidine thiocyanate method ( 27 ) .
Total RNA was then electrophoresed in formaldehyde-denaturing agarose gels and subjected to nylon blot hybridization with the ye chain probe at 42°C overnight .
Washes were performed in 2 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 60 °C for 20 min and 0.2 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 60°C for 10 min .
After exposure of the autoradiogram , the filters were stripped and rehybridized to an actin probe to verify both quantity and quality of RNA loadings .
Immunofluorescence-The constitutive expression of IL-2Re , -8 , and ye chain was detected in the different cell lines by using immunofluorescence techniques .
Indirect immunofluorescence using the murine mAb 341 , directed against the IL2RB chain ( Immunotech , France ) , and the rat mAb TuGh4 ( a generous gift of Dr. K. Sugamura ) , directed against the IL2Ry chain ( 28 ) , was performed to measure surface expression .
The second antibodies were biotin-conjugated anti-mouse Ig ( Jackson , West Grove , PA ) and biotin-conjugated anti-rat Ig ( Jackson , West Grove ) with mAb 341 and TuGh4 , respectively .
Both second antibodies were revealed with phycoerythrin-conjugated avidin ( Caltag , San Francisco ) .
Cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer as described ( 29 ) .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays ( EMSAs ) -Raji and Jurkat cells were collected , pelleted , and lysed by resuspension in 4 volumes of 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 , 0.3 M NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.5 % Triton X-100 , 1 % aprotinin , 100 ug/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl flu-oride , 10 ug/ml leupeptin .
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1400 x g for 15 min , and supernatants were used as a source of protein for DNA binding experiments .
Oligonucleotide probes were labeled by filling in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [ a- `` `` P ] 4CTP .
DNA binding reactions were carried out as described previously ( 30 ) .
Competitor oligonucleotides were first added as indicated in the figure legends and then the addition of the cellular extracts was followed by an incubation of 10 min on ice .
Binding reactions were started when the probe was added , and samples were loaded after 15 min at room temperature on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel ( acrylamide/ bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1 ) in 0.25 x TBE ( 1 x TBE = 0.089 m Tris , 0.089 M boric acid , 2.5 mM EDTA , pH 8.3 ) and electrophoresed at 160 V for 2 h at room temperature .
Gels were fixed , dried , and exposed to Kodak X-0-Mat S film overnight at room temperature using an intensifying screen .
For incubation with serum for the supershift assays , 2 pl of either a control nonimmune serum , an ErbA control antiserum ( 31 ) , or antisera specific to either Ets 1/2 ( 82 ) , Fli-1 ( 383 ) , GABPa and - $ ( a generous gift of Dr. S. Mc Knight ) , Elf-1 ( a generous gift of Dr. J. M. Leiden ) were added to binding reactions and incubation was continued for 15 min before loading the gels .
Oligonucleotides Used for EMSAs-Only the GGAA containing strand of the oligonucleotide is shown , with the EBS core underlined .
Every oligonucleotide includes an Xhol site at its 5 ' side and is flanked by Aval restriction sites ( 84 ) .
The EBS used as a probe ( oligonucleotide 98 ) has the following sequence ( plus strand ) : 5 TCG GGC TCG AGT TCC ACC GGA AGC TAT C 3 ' and is flanked by Xhol and Aval restrictions site too .
Oligonucleotide 98 encompasses the potential Ets site found in position -68 of the human yc promoter .
Oligonucleotides 386 , 388 , 412 , and 305 were described previously ( 84 ) .
Oligonucleotide 386 is an optimized high affinity in vitro binding site for Ets proteins .
Oligonucleotide 388 is derived from oligonucleotide B with the replacement A - > T in the EBS core and has a low affinity for the binding of EIf-1 .
Oligonucleotide 412 differs from oligonucleotide 386 by a GG - CC transversion at positions +1 and +2 in the EBS core and is therefore unable to bind Ets proteins .
Oligonucleotide 305 is a high affinity binding site for Pu-1/ Spi-1 and Spi B .

Total RNA was electrophoresed in formaldehyde-denaturing agarose gel and subjected to nylon blot hybridization with the radiolabeled yc chain probe .
Filter containing nonhematopoietic cells ( 7-10 ) were exposed for a longer time ( 72 h ) than hematopoietic cell filter ( 24 h ) to ensure absence of detectable specific signal .
After exposure of the autoradiogram , filters were stripped and rehybridized to an actin probe to verify both quantity and quality of RNA loadings .

RESULTS Cell and Tissue-specific Expression of the ye Chain-Expres-sion of the ye chain was determined at the mRNA level by Northern blot analysis and at the membrane level by immunofluorescence studies .
Total RNA was isolated from a variety of human hematopoietic cells ( Jurkat , YT , IARC 301.5 , Raji , BCL , and K562 ) and nonhematopoietic cells ( Hep-G2 , DLD1 , fibro-blasts ) and hybridized with a human yc chain probe .
As shown in Fig .
1A , an abundant 1.8-kilobase yc transcript was present in all the hematopoietic cells tested and was absent in the other cell lines or tissues , whereas reprobing the same blot with a B-actin probe detected high levels of B-actin transcript in all the samples .
Among the yc ( + ) cell lines , membrane expression of the yc chain was detected only on the B lymphoblastoid cells ( BCL and Raji ) , the natural killer-like cell YT , and the T cells ( IARC 301.5 ) ( Fig .
1B ) .
To try to elucidate the elements critical for the regulation of tissue-specific expression of the human yc gene , promoter activity of the region upstream of the initiation codon was analyzed in various cell types using a luciferase reporter gene in transient tranfection assay .
Important Tissue-specific cis-Regulatory Elements Are Located within -90/+34 bp of the ye Gene Transcription Start Site-Cloning and sequencing of 1595 bp upstream of the major transcription site allowed the identification of 18 GGAA or GGAT ( 35 ) sequences typical of those recognized by the Ets family of proteins ( Fig .
24 ) .
To delineate the cis-acting elements regulating yc expression , we first examined the activity of the full-length promoter ( -1053/+34 ) ( +1 corresponds to the major transcription site ) and of a series of nested 5'-deletion constructs derived in the Raji cell line ( Fig .
2B ) .
The -1053/ +34 construct was 460-fold more active than the pGI2 basic promoterless control vector in the Raji cell line to induce luciferase activity .
Similar activity was detected when assessing 14851 the five promoter constructs containing a promoter fragment starting at positions -1053 , -754 , -292 , -166 , and -117 bp , respectively , of the 5'-flanking region , whereas expression driven by the construct containing only the last -90 bp of the 5'-flank displayed a 45 % reduction in activity as compared with the largest construct .
A further deletion of 46 bp ( -44/+34 ) totally abolished promoter activity ( Fig .
2B ) .
These data show that the yc promoter gene contains a critical regulatory region between nucleotide positions -90 and -44 which is required for promoter activity in the Raji cell line .
Since ye chain expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells , we next analyzed the specificity of our yc promoter constructs in other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines .
As shown in Fig .
3 , the -754/+34 to -90/+34 constructs were also active after transfection in a natural killer-like cell line ( YT ) and in a myelogenous leukemia cell line ( K562 ) and in two different T cell lines ( Jurkat and IARC 301.5 ) , but they were poorly or not active at all after transfection in nonhematopoietic tissues or cell lines such as primary fibroblasts or fibroblasts transformed by SV40 ( Fig .
3 and data not shown ) in the hepatoma cell line Hep-G2 or in the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1 ( Fig .
3 ) .
We therefore conclude that expression of these promoter constructs exhibited cell-type specificity .
Functional Role of the Two EBS Present in the -90 to -44 yc Promoter Region-Since the -90/+34 promoter construct ( G1bS8 ) was shown to exhibit significant promoter activity in all hematopoietic cell lines , we analyzed the activity of this construct in further detail .
Comparison of the human and the murine yc chain promoter in this region identified numerous stretches of homology shared by both receptor promoters , which may represent sites essential for activity .
Alignment of the flanking sequence of the human gene with the one of the mouse genes revealed two GGAA motifs typical of the core of DNA binding sites recognized by the Ets family of proteins ( 15 , 35 ) in the region between -90 and -44 in the promoter at position -68/65 and -53/-50 , respectively ( Fig .
4 ) .
To evaluate the functional role of the two putative EBS at -68 and -53 , we prepared a series of additional promoter constructs .
The H4 , J13 , and DM constructs are identical to the -90/+34 G1bS construct except for the presence of a transversion of the core GG dinucleotide in either the first ( -68/H4 ) or in the second ( -53/J13 ) or both ( DM ) first and second putative EBS .
These constructs were then transiently transfected in the Raji and Jurkat cell lines .
The promoter construct containing the mutation at the first EBS ( H4 ) or at both sites ( DM ) showed background luciferase activity in both cell lines , whereas a similar luciferase activity as the parental reporter plasmid ( G1bS ) was not modified when the second site ( J13 ) only was mutated ( Fig .
5 ) .
These data strongly suggest that the EBS present at position -68 is a determinant for the basal activity of the human yc chain gene in Jurkat and Raji cells .
Characterization of the DNA-Protein Complexes Associated with the Functional EBS Present in the Basal Promoter Region of the ye Gene-To analyze whether extracts from Raji cells contain DNA binding proteins able to interact with the first EBS at -68/-65 , EMSAs were performed using a 28-mer oligonucleotide probe encompassing this putative EBS .
Several DNA-protein complexes were observed in this analysis ( Fig .
6 , lane 2 ) ; four of these complexes correspond to specific binding of nuclear proteins to the probe since they were competed in a dose-dependent manner by an excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the probe 98 ( Fig .
6 , lanes 3 and 4 ) but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide competitor ( oligo 412 ) ( Fig .
6 , lane 9 ) .
The nature of the nuclear proteins binding to the probe were next studied by EMSAs using competitor oligonucleotides with different binding activity for members of the Ets 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 14852 Regulation of ye Gene Promoter Activity by Ets Products A B +1595 1490-1419 1052 928 788 .

When used as a competitor , an oligonucleotide ( oligo 386 ) known to bind all of the Ets proteins totally abolished formation of the four DNA-protein complexes ( Fig .

Almost complete inhibition in the formation of the four complexes was also observed with an oligonucleotide ( oligo 388 ) differing from oligo 386 only by the presence of a GGAT core instead of GGAA ( Fig .

Comparison of the human and murine yc promoter regions .
Sequence of the human ( Noguchi et al .
( 4 ) ) and murine ( DiS-anto ef al .
( 11 ) ) 5'-upstream sequence is compared using the Gene Jockey program .
Sequences are numbered relative to the major transcription start site of the human gene .
Two GGAA purine-rich motifs , typical of those recognized by the Ets family of proteins , are boxed in each sequence .
1/Pu-1 appears to be absent from these complexes since an oligonucleotide ( oligo 305 ) which efficiently binds this protein was found unable to compete complex formation in the assay ( Fig .
6 , lanes 10 and 11 ) .
Binding patterns and binding competitions observed using Jurkat nuclear extracts and the same labeled probe 98 were undistinguishable from those seen with Raji nuclear extracts ( data not shown ) .
These experiments strongly suggested that members of the Ets family of transcription factors were involved in the complexes observed .
Further identification of the various Ets protein members bound to the -68 to -54 promoter region was performed by supershift assays using specific antibodies .
In EMSAs using either Raji ( Fig .
7 ) or Jurkat ( data not shown ) nuclear extracts and the labeled probe 98 , a slower migrating supershifted complex was observed using an antiserum specific for GABPa ( Fig .
7 , lane 7 ) .
The appearance of this supershifted band was accompanied by the complete disappearance of the major upper complex C1 and of most of the faster migrating complex C4 .
These data show that GABPa is involved in the formation of these complexes .
The same complexes were also supershifted when an anti-GABPB was used ( Fig .
7 , lane 8 ) .
GABPS is a Notch-related non-Ets protein that exists in cells as a stable heterodimeric complex with the GABPa , to form GABP ( 36 ) .
Only a very faint supershifted band was observed after addition of a monoclonal antibody specific to Elf-1 ( Fig .
7 , lane 9 ) , but it is unclear which of the C2 to C4 complexes were affected .
No supershifted bands were observed with antibodies specific for Spil/Pu-1 , Etsl , Ets2 , Flil , or a control Erb-A antiserum .

EMSAs of Raji nuclear protein binding to the 98 sequence .
100 fmol of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide 98 prepared as described under `` Materials and Methods `` were incubated with no nuclear extract ( Zane 1 ) or nuclear extracts prepared from uninduced Raji cells ( Zanes 2-11 ) .
Binding reactions were performed either in the absence ( - ) or in the presence of a 10 or 50 molar excess of the respective unlabeled oligonucleotide as indicated .
At least four complexes can be detected and are marked with arrows .
These results indicate that the complexes C1 and C4 result from DNA binding by GABP and most probably correspond to the binding of distinct heteromeric forms of GABP ( 86 ) .
Since the minor C2 and C3 complexes display a DNA binding specificity indistinguishable from that of Ets proteins and yet were not supershifted by available antibodies to a panel of Ets proteins , these complexes are likely to result from binding of members of the Ets family other than Ets1 , Ets2 , Fli1 , GABP , EIf-1 , and Spil/Pu-1 .
Transactivation of the -+34 ye Promoter Construct by GABP-To analyze the ability of several Ets proteins to activate the yc promoter , the -90/+34 promoter construct ( G1bS ) was cotransfected , together with an expression vector for either GABPa + B , or EIf-1 or Ets-1 into Hela cells .

Effect of antibodies to known Ets members on the different complexes .
Supershifts were performed as described under `` Materials and Methods `` with the radiolabeled 98 oligonucleotide probe , which was added to no nuclear extract ( ane 5 ) or nuclear extract from Raji cells ( Zanes 6-10 ) , preincubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 2 pl of polyclonal antisera against GABP « ( Zane 7 ) , GABPB ( lane 8 ) , and ErbA ( lane 10 ) , and 1 ul of monoclonal antiserum against Elf-1 ( Zane 9 ) .
+34 construct by Elf-1 and Ets-1 ( Fig .
8B and data not shown ) , expression of GABP was found to activate this promoter construct .
Transactivation by GABP is dependent upon the integrity of the EBS centered at nucleotide -67 since a promoter construct ( H4 ) harboring a GG to CC transversion , which inhibits formation of the GABP complex , in this EBS core sequence failed to respond to GABP in cotransfection assay ( Fig .
8 , A and B ) .
In addition , maximal activation by GABP appeared to require complex formation between the a and B subunit ( Fig .
8 , A and B ) since transfection of the GABPa subunit alone did not result in a significant increase in promoter activity ( Fig .
8B ) .
We conclude from these experiments that the heteromeric forms of GABP transactivate the yc promoter region through binding to the EBS ( GGAA ) element centered at position -67 .
DISCUSSION In this work , we analyzed the 5 regulatory elements of the yc gene essential for tissue-specific expression of this gene .
We show that a 1053-bp fragment 5 ' to the yc initiation site mediates promoter activity in all the hematopoietic cells studied , whereas no activity of this promoter was detectable in nonhematopoietic cells .
This promoter activity parallels transcription of the yc gene in the different cell lines .
Tissue specificity of the promoter activity was conserved in the deletion constructs maintaining 90 bp of the 5 ' regulatory region .
No negative regulatory region clearly appeared in our study as previously suggested ( 13 ) .
Since Jurkat cells were tested in both analyses , differences between the deletion mutant constructs analyzed in each study may account for this apparent discrepancy .
The various putative cis-acting elements identified upstream of the -117-bp fragment do not appear essential for promoter activity in Raji cells since similar promoter activity was observed either with the largest construct ( -1053 bp ) or with shorter constructs containing up to -117 bp .
A slight progressive decrease in promoter activity was observed in other hematopoietic cells .
These elements are even not essential for tissue-specific expression of the gene since the -90/+34 region which defines the basal promoter activity allows similar cell type-specific expression as largest constructs .
This tissue-specific basal promoter activity is dependent upon the integrity of the first EBS ( -68 ) as depicted by mutational analysis , and its activity is not 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 14854 A B Regulation of ye Gene Promoter Activity by Ets Products 140000 7 140000 ~ 120000 7 120000 & 100000 { 100000 > £ J g 80000 7 80000 & ® ka £ ©0000 - 60000 & = rl 40000 - 40000 4 20000 ~ 20000 4 o 44 o = G1bS H4 Mut G1bS G1bS G1bS H4 Mut 20 ng - 10nga _ 20ng 10 ng « 50 ng 50 ng 50 ng 50 ng 50 ng 25 ng a - 50 ng 25 ng « AEB +10 ng B - AEB - +10 ng $ B AEB - E1 _ AEB _ a AEB - +25 ng B- AEB - +25 ng B Fic .

Transactivation assay of yc basal promoter construct using GABP or Elf-1 expression vectors .
Helia cells were cotransfected with 500 ng of the wild type ( GIbS ) or mutated ( H4 ) -90/+34 construct and either the expression plasmid or the empty expression vector AEB as a control .
Different amounts of expressions vectors were used in A and B. GABPa and GABPB are indicated as « and B on the graph .
Cotransfection experiments were performed in triplicate , and the results presented here are means of several assays .
affected by mutation in the second putative EBS ( -53 ) .
Ets factors represent a group of proteins containing an 85-amino acid Ets domain that interacts with a purine-rich core sequence , GGA ( A/T ) .
Many members of this family ( e.g .
Spi-1 , Spi-B , Ets-1 , Ets-2 , Elf-1 , Fli-1 , Erg , and GABP ) are expressed in hematopoietic cells ( 16 , 35 , 37 ) and several of them have been shown to function as transcriptional activa-tors , further supporting a role for Ets protein in lineage commitment and stage progression during hematopoiesis .
In the presence of Raji or Jurkat nuclear extracts , the -68 EBS of the yc promoter binds in vitro GABP heteromeric complexes and EIf-1 .
Among these two factors , only GABPa when cotransfected in Hela cells with GABPB was able by binding the -68 EBS to induce some degree of transactivation of the ye promoter indicating that GABP « -GABPB complex is a transcriptional activator in this context .
Since GABP is expressed in both hematopoietic cells , particularly in the thymus cells ( 16 ) and nonhematopoietic cells , it may play an important role in yc promoter activity .
However , it seems unlikely , because of its wide tissue expression ( 38 ) , that GABP alone could account for the tissue-specific activity exhibited by the -90/+34 promoter construct .
Cell-type specificity is likely to be conferred either by specific post-trans-lational modifications of GABP and/or by interactions with tissue-specific cofactors .
Interestingly , an essential EBS was also identified in the enhancer region immediately upstream of the start of transcription of the chain gene ( 39 ) with binding activity for GABP and Ets-1 .
yc promoter also shares with the promoter housekeeping promoter characteristics including lack of TATA , CAAT boxes , and initiator elements , whereas an Ets DNA binding motif was found close to the transcriptional initiation site .
It was previously suggested that Ets proteins bound to the latter EBS of such promoter organization could recruit other transcriptional factors to form a transcriptional initiation complex ( 15 ) .
Housekeeping gene promoter structure associated as in the yc promoter with the presence of multiple putative or proven Ets binding sequences ( 40 , 41 ) was also identified in promoters that direct tissue- or stage-specific gene expression .
As postulated by Bittinger et al .
( 40 ) , recruitment and regulated expression of the general transcription machinery in this setting may take place by providing a joint activation domain formed by the concerted binding of the Ets factors or association with another activator protein ( s ) .
Elf-1 as well as non-identified Ets-related members other than Spi-1 , Ets-1 , or Fli-1 also bind to the EBS of the yc gene promoter .
In contrast to GABP which appears to be widely expressed , Elf-1 has been reported to be more specific to lymphoid tissues ( 42 ) .
Since we failed to detect activation of the -90/+34 promoter construct with EIf-1 , interaction with other ( s ) proteins binding further upstream in the yc promoter region may be important for its specific regulation .
ye gene defect causes severe combined immunodeficiency whose curative therapy until now depends on bone marrow transplantation success .
The severity of this disease and the recent cloning of the yc chain gene enable us to consider gene therapy as a potential therapeutic option especially in patients with no HLA-compatible donor .
Retroviral yc gene construct controlled by long terminal repeat-based promoter could permit yc gene transfer into SCID X1 hematopoietic CD34 * stem cells with expression of the transgene in the various hematopoietic lineages . ``
However , overexpression of yc gene at discrete stages of lymphoid ( 12 ) or myeloid development or inadequate ye gene expression at the surface of red blood cells or platelets may be deleterious .
If such fine yc transcription regulation is needed , a more physiologic control of yc gene expression will be required .
The data herein reported delineating a tissue-specific promoter activity in less than 1-kilobase pair make feasible the construction of ye gene expression vectors under the control of a minimal tissue-specific promoter determining appropriate basal yc gene expression .
