HEMATOPOIESIS An Essential Role for NF-xB in Human CD34¢ Bone Marrow Cell Survival By David W. Pyatt , Wayne S. Stillman , Yanzhu Yang , Sherilyn Gross , Jia hua Zheng , and Richard D. Irons The transcription factor , NF- « B , is important for T-cell activation , B-cell maturation , and human immunodeficiency virus transcription and plays a role in alternatively mediating and protecting against apoptosis in a variety of cell types .
However , a role for NF- « B in human CD34+* bone marrow cells has not been described .
We provide evidence here that virtually all human CD34+ bone marrow cells express NF- « B that can be activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and a variety of cytokines , eg , tumor necrosis factor « , interleukin-3 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony F- « B IS A MEMBER of the mammalian Rel family of transcriptional activators that plays a central role in the activation and regulation of immune response .
!
The family consists of 5 discrete DNA binding proteins ( p50 , p52 , p65 , c-rel , and ReIB ) that share partial homology , including a common DNA binding domain , dimerization domains , and a nuclear localization region .
Rel family members form ho-modimers or heterodimers that bind to a specific DNA sequence called the xB motif . ``
NF- « B is a heterodimer consisting of the 50-kD ( p50 ) and 65-kD ( p65 ) subunits® that , in its inactive state , is located in the cytoplasm bound to an inhibitory protein , IxBa . ``
'' Upon activation , NF-KB disassociates from translocates to the nucleus `` and binds to DNA to regulate gene expression ( for review see Thanos and Maniatis® and Siebenlist et al `` ? )
.
Additionally , complex binding patterns among various members of the Rel family may account for differential gene activation with or without interaction with other transcriptional regulatory proteins . ``
NF-KB is required for the expression of several gene products relevant to hematopoiesis including interleukin-1B ( IL-1B ) , `` tumor necrosis factor- « ( TNF-a ) , !

In addition , we demonstrate that NF- « B may be required for human CD34+ bone marrow cell clonogenic function and survival .
These results offer insight into a new role for NF-kB in maintaining survival and function in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and suggest that proposed strategies involving inhibition of NF- « B activation as an adjunct to cancer chemotherapy should be approached with caution .

In addition , is activated by cytokines known to regulate hematopoiesis such as TNF- « , `` `` IL-la and IL-1B , * INF-y , `` leukemia inhibitory factor , `` `` M-CSF `` GM-CSF , `` transforming growth factor- B1 ( TGF-B1 ) , *° and IL-3 . ``
The role of NF-KB as a secondary messenger for cytokine response , as well as the hematopoiesis-specific genes that are responsive to NF-KB , suggest that it may be important in human CD34 * cell survival and/or differentiation .
Studies with disruption of the various Rel family proteins support this observation .
The disruption of the re/A4 locus ( p65 ) leads to embryonic lethality at 15 to 16 days of gestation with massive liver degeneration .
`` ?
Mice with homozygous disruption of relB exhibit multifocal , mixed inflammatory cell infiltration in several organs , myeloid hyperplasia , splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis , a reduced number of thymic dendritic cells , and impaired cellular immunity . ``
' Mice lacking p50 show no developmental abnormalities , but have impaired B-cell responses . ``
Mice with constitutive NF-kB activation due to the disruption of IxBa expression show enhanced granulopoiesis and die within 8 days after birth . ``
In addition , both apoptosis and anti-apoptotic functions can be mediated via NF- « B activation in different cells.3+ `` 5 NF- « B was originally described as a DNA-binding activity that recognized a sequence in the Ig k light chain gene enhancer in mature B cells . ``
Subsequently , NE- « B has been found in all mature hematopoietic cell lineages ( eg , T cells , `` `` monocytes , `` `` granulocytes , `` mast cells , `` `` and dendritic cells* `` ) and has been recently reported to be involved in erythropoiesis . ``
However , the expression and role of NF-kB in human CD34* bone marrow cells are currently unknown .
Therefore , we investigated whether NF-kB is present in CD34 * bone marrow cells and whether NF-kB is required for colony formation .
The results of these studies demonstrate that virtually all human CD34* bone marrow cells contain NF-kB and that NF- « B is required for human CD34+* bone marrow cell clonogenic function and survival .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell purification .
_ All protocols were approved by the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Internal Review Board , and samples were taken with informed consent from normal adult volunteers .
Human bone marrow and blood were obtained by aspiration from the posterior iliac crest and venapuncture , respectively .
Mononuclear cells were isolated using Histopaque-1077 ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) AU # 2 , and purification of individual cell subpopulations was achieved using a high magnetic gradient MiniMACS purification system ( Miltenyi , Sun Blood , Vol 93 , No 10 ( May 15 ) , 1999 : pp 3302-3308 AN ESSENTIAL ROLE FOR NF- « B IN HUMAN CD34+ nyvale , CA ) .
Because NF-kB is known to be expressed in B lympho-cytes , `` we used the pan-B-cell antigen CD19 to isolate CD34* bone marrow cells devoid of B cells ( CD34*CD19~ ) for use in these studies .
CD19+* cells were removed and detected by using a fluorescein isothiocynate ( FITC ) -conjugated anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody followed by anti-FITC MicroBeads ( Miltenyi ) .
CD34*CD19~ cells were then obtained by using the CD34 isolation kit .
CD4* T cells were purified using CD4 Microbeads .
The purity of isolated cells was determined by flow cytometry analysis ( Epics 752 ; Coulter Electronics , Hialeah , FL ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
- Human CD34 *CDI19~ bone marrow cells were either used directly after purification or for selected experiments cultured at 0.4 X 10° cells/mL for 18 hours at 37°C with 5 % CO ; in complete media ( RPMI-1640 , 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 mg/mL streptomycin , 100 U/mL penicillin , and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine ) with and without 25 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , cytokines , or NF- « B nuclear localization-sequence ( NLS ) peptides before use in the EMSA .
Cytokine concentrations used in these experiments were identical to those used in the colony-forming assays and was used at 50 ng/mL .
Initial experiments were performed with NF-kB NLS peptides purchased from Biomol ( Ply-mouth Meeting , PA ) ; however , quality control issues required us to synthesize these peptides based on the published sequences . ``
The NF- « B NLS peptides were used at 100 ug/mL .
Nuclear protein was extracted using a modified Dignam protocol `` from 0.5 to 1 million cells per treatment group .
Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein kit ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) and the nuclear extracts were frozen at -80°C until used .
An NF-xB probe was made and labeled as described .
* `` For super-shift samples , cellular extracts were preincubated with appropriate specific antibodies for 1 hour to overnight at 4°C .
Antihuman p50 , p52 , p65 , and rel B antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) , and antihuman c-rel and a second antihuman p65 antibody were purchased from Rockland ( Gil-bertsville , PA ) .
Nuclear protein ( 4 ug ) was incubated on ice for 10 minutes with 1 ug dl-dC , 4 uL binding buffer ( 20 mmol/L HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] 40 mmol/L KCI , 10 % glycerol , 0.05 mmol/L EDTA , 1.6 mmol/L MgC ] ; ) 1 mmol/L DTT , and deionized water for a total volume of 19 uL .
One microliter of *°P-labeled probe ( ~50,000 cpm ) was added , and the binding reaction was continued for 30 minutes at 22°C .
After complex formation , 2 ug of loading buffer ( 250 mmol/L Tris HCI [ pH 7.51 , 0.2 % bromophenol blue , 0.2 % xylene cyanol , 40 % glycerol ) was added to the DNA-protein complexes , and the sample was analyzed by electrophoresis on a prerinsed 6 % polyacrylamide gel .
The gels were dried and exposed at -80°C to Fuji x-ray film ( Tokyo , Japan ) .
All reported experiments were repeated at least 3 times .
Measuring NF- « B by flow cytometry .
Cells were exposed to 25 ng/mL PMA and 1 ug/mL ionomycin or buffer for 1 hour at 37°C in RPMI-1640 containing 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) .
The cells were then washed , followed by permeabilization in 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , pH 7.2 , with 0.1 % saponin and 0.01 mol/L HEPES for 10 minutes at room temperature .
The cells were labeled with 2 ug/mL anti-NF- « B antibody ( IgGs ; Boerhinger Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) or a nonspecific IgG , antibody ( isotype control ) .
The cells were then labeled with biotin-conjugated goat antimouse IgGs , washed 2 times , and subsequently labeled with allophyocyanin ( APC ) -conjugated strepavidin .
After the final wash , the cells were fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde and stored at 4°C until flow cytometric analysis .
Flow cytometry was performed using a MoFlo system ( Cytomation , Fort Collins , CO ) .
These experiments were repeated at least 3 times .
Colony-forming assays .
These were performed as previously de-scribed . ``
Briefly , CD34 * bone marrow cells were purified and plated in 35-mm culture dishes at a concentration of 3 to 4.5 X 10° cells/mL in 1 mL of modified Iscove 's medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 mg/mL streptomycin , 100 U/mL penicillin , 2 mmol/L L-glutamine , 3303 50 umol/L 2-mercaptoethanol , 1.2 % ( wt/vol ) methyl cellulose , and recombinant cytokines .
Each cytokine was used at concentrations experimentally determined to produce maximal colony formation ( eg , 5 ng/mL GM-CSF , 25 ng/mL IL-3 , 25 ng/mL G-CSF , 25 ng/mL M-CSF , 25 ng/mL stem cell factor [ SCF ] , and 5 U/mL EPO ) .
All chemicals were mixed with the methyl cellulose media before the addition of cells , which preceded the addition of the cytokines .
All cultures were maintained at 37°C in 5 % CO ; and scored on day 14 of culture .
Five plates were scored for each treatment group , and results are expressed as the mean + 1 standard error of the mean ( SEM ) .
Significant differences ( P =.05 ) between groups were determined using the Student 's test ( Excel 4.0 ; Microsoft Corp , Redmond , WA ) .
All reported experiments were repeated at least 3 times .
Apoptosis assay .
- Purified CD34 ~CD19~ bone marrow cells were exposed to NF- « B NLS fusion peptide , control peptide , or buffer in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum in 5 % CO ; at 37°C for 16 hours .
Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric analysis of deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ; In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit ; Boerhinger Mannheim ) for each sample .
All reported experiments were repeated at least 3 times .
RESULTS Induction of NF- « B-specific DNA-binding activity in human CD34*CD19~ bone marrow cells .
- CD34* bone marrow cells devoid of B cells ( CD34*CD197 ) were used in these studies , because NF-xB is known to be expressed in B lymphocytes ( see Materials and Methods ) . ``
CD34*CD19- bone marrow cells were purified and cultured overnight with and without PMA .
EMSA of the nuclear extracts demonstrate no detectable NF-kB specific DNA-binding in the unstimulated cells ; however , PMA exposure induced considerable binding ( Fig 1 ) .

PMA induces NF- « B specific DNA-binding in human CD34*CD19~- bone marrow cells .
To confirm specificity and identify which Rel family members may be binding to the NF- « B consensus sequence , super-shift EMSA were performed with antibodies specific for human p50 , p65 , p52 , rel B , and c-rel .
The CD34+CD19~ cells were 96.8 % pure for this representative experiment .
3304 EMSA using antibodies specific for the Rel family members demonstrated the presence of p50 , p65 , and c-rel by the appearance of shifted bands ( Fig 1 ) .
Although antibodies specific for p52 and rel B did not cause a supershift , the possibility that any of these Rel family members are present can not be completely excluded due the heterogeneity of the CD34* cells .
The unreactive antibodies serve as an Ig control demonstrating the specificity of the p50 , p65 , and c-rel antibod-ies .
NF-KB distribution in human CD34*CD197~ bone marrow cells .
We evaluated the distribution of activated NF-KB in both PMA-stimulated and unstimulated human CD34*CD19-~-bone marrow and CD4* T cells by flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope within the NE- « B nuclear localization region that is exposed upon activa-tion . ``
'' Using this antibody , we confirmed the results of the EMSA and determined that activated NF- « B is present in virtually all human CD34*CD19~ cells ( Fig 2 ) .
NF-KB is required for CD34* cell colony formation .
To determine if is necessary for colony formation , a fusion peptide containing the NF-kB NLS and a membrane-permeable hydrophobic region that has been previously demonstrated to specifically prevent NF-kB nuclear translocation `` was added to the media in a methyl cellulose colony-forming assay .
After activation of NF-KB , its NLS associates with a specific NLS-receptor , resulting in transport of NF-KB in to the nucleus .
This Cell Number NF-xB Fig 2 .
Activated NF- « B measured by flow cytometry in human CD4+ peripheral T cells ( [ A ] unstimulated , [ B ] stimulated ) and CD34+CD19- bone marrow cells ( [ C ] unstimulated , [ D ] stimulated ) .
Stimulated cells were incubated with 25 ng/mL PMA and 1 pg/mL ionomycin for 1 hour at 37°C before NF- « B analysis .
Activated NF- « B is a black line and the background isotype antibody binding is a gray line for each sample .
The monoclonal antibody used in these experiments has been shown to be specific for the NF- « B nuclear localization region , which is detected only if NF-B is activated .
The CD4+ T cells and CD34+CD19- bone marrow cells were more than 97 % and more than 99 % pure , respectively .

- Blocking NF- « B nuclear translocation inhibits human CD34+ bone marrow cell colony formation .
Human CD34+ bone marrow was purified ( > 96 % pure ) and cultured in methyl cellulose medium containing various cytokines and ( 1 ) 200 mg/mL NF- « B NLS peptide , ( 2 ) 200 pg/mL control peptide , and ( 3 ) no peptides .

*Significant decrease compared with cultures containing the control peptide ( P = .05 ) .
can be blocked by occupying the NF-kB NLS-receptors with peptides possessing the NF-kB NLS .
NF-kB NLS peptide and control peptide ( an inactive NF-kB NLS via specific amino acid substitutions ) were used to evaluate the effects of NF-kB inhibition on colony-forming unit ( CFU ) formation using human CD34* bone marrow cells stimulated by either GM-CSE , IL-3 , M-CSF , G-CSF , or a mixture of IL-3 , SCF , GM-CSF , and EPO ( Fig 3 ) .
These results suggest that NF-kB is either required for cell proliferation and/or required for clonogenic cell survival .
GM-CSF , IL-3 , and TNF-a , but not M-CSF and G-CSF , activate NF-KB in human CD34*CD19~ bone marrow cells .
EMSA were performed to determine if CFU formation/ inhibition ( Fig 3 ) correlates with NF-KB activation/inhibition , respectively , using the cytokines and NF-kB fusion peptides previously described .
As a positive control , EMSA was also performed using TNF- « , because it is a well-documented activator of NF- « B in a variety of cell types .
The results of these experiments demonstrate that GM-CSF , IL-3 , and TNF- « activate NF- « B and that NF-KB nuclear localization is blocked by the active fusion peptide ( Fig 4 ) for each stimulus .
G-CSF and M-CSF did not activate NF-kB in these studies .
These results are consistent with previous findings using other cell types except for M-CSF , which has been shown to activate NE- « B in macrophages .
? ``
NF-KB activation by cytokines does not correlate with CFU formation , because there are NF-KB activators ( PMA and TNF- « @ ) that do not induce CFU formation and there are cytokines ( G-CSF and M-CSF ) that stimulate CFU formation but do not activate NF-kB .
In addition , there were several experiments in which there was a baseline NF-kB activity ( Fig 4A , C , and D ) suggesting that NE- « B activity may be constitutive .
Although NF-KB activation does not correlate with CFU formation , NF- « B inhibition does correlate with CFU inhibition .

suggest that NF- « B may be required for cell survival rather than proliferation .
NF-KB is required for human CD34*CD19~7 cell survival .
To test whether NF-kB is required for human CD34* cell survival , apoptosis was measured using the TUNEL assay in human CD34*CD19~ cells incubated for 16 hours with NF- « B NLS fusion active or control peptide .
Cells were also exposed to 50 umol/L etoposide as a positive control for apoptosis .

These results suggest that NF-KB is necessary for human CD34*CD19~ bone marrow cell survival .
DISCUSSION We demonstrate here that NF-KB is present in human CD34*CD19- bone marrow cells and may play a role in their survival .
Virtually all CD34*CD19~ , human bone marrow cells contain NF-kB DNA-binding activity that can be activated by PMA exposure , and a variety of cytokines ( eg , GM-CSEB , IL-3 , and TNF-a ) are able to activate NF- « B in these cells .

( A ) Inhibition of NF- « B nuclear translocation induced apoptosis of human CD34+CD19~ human bone marrow cells .
The deoxynucleotidyl TUNEL assay was performed on human CD34+CD19-~ bone marrow cells ( > 98 % pure ) after ( A ) 16 or ( B ) 18 hours of incubation with various agents . ``
The controls were incubated with buffer only ( § ) or 50 mol/L etoposide ( Z ) .
( A ) NF- « B NLS peptide ( MI ) ; control mutant peptide ( B ) .
( B ) Flow cytogram comparison of apoptosis induced by 50 g/mL NF- « B NLS peptide ( black line ) and control mutant peptide ( gray line ) show n in ( A ) .
3306 specificity was verified by antibody recognition in both the supershift EMSA and flow cytometric assays and by competitive inhibition of nuclear translocation using a peptide specific for the NF-kB NLS .
In addition , inhibition of NF- « B nuclear translocation induced both apoptosis and loss of clonogenic function in human CD34+* cells .
These findings are consistent with the established role of NF-KB as a secondary messenger for GM-CSF `` IL-3 , `` and TNF- « `` signal transduction as measured in other cell types .
Contrary to other studies , `` `` M-CSF did not activate NF-KB in our system .
It is possible that the proportion of the CD34*CD19~ bone marrow cells that expressed M-CSF receptors and are therefore capable of responding to M-CSF was below the threshold of NF- « B detection in the EMSA .
Another explanation is that the M-CSF signal transduction pathway in mature or peripheral mononuclear phagocytes uses NF-kB , `` `` whereas CD34*CD19~ bone marrow cells used in our experiments have an NF- « kB-independent M-CSF signal transduction pathway .
Differences in activation have been observed for IL-3 signaling , depending on the cell type .
Oster et al `` `` did not detect NF-kB activation after IL-3 exposure using human peripheral mononuclear phagocytes , but Besangon et al `` `` did observe IL-3-induced activation in a pro-B IL-3-dependent cell line ( Ba/F3 ) .
In addition , these investigators demonstrated that NF- « B was required for survival in these cells .
Our results indicate both NF-KB activation by IL-3 and a requirement for NF- « B in CD34*CD19- bone marrow cell survival .
It has been reported that Rel family members are sequentially expressed during B-cell development and that ordered expression may help regulate genes that are involved in any one stage of differentiation . ``
Flow cytometric analysis of p65 distribution in CD34* cells suggests that p65 is present in virtually all CD34* cells , suggesting a role for NF-KB in supporting cell survival rather than in the regulation of differentiation-specific genes .
The distribution of c-rel and its possible role in stage-specific differentiation of human CD34+* bone marrow cells remains unknown .
A number of different mechanisms may explain the role of NF- « B in the survival of CD34 * cells .
Inhibition of NF- « B has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types , and in B lymphocytes , inhibition of NF-KB is reported to be associated with a decline in c-myc expression . ``
'' NF-kB has also been shown to transactivate c-myb as well , `` which is also required for hematopoietic cell survival . ``
In addition , NF- « B is a positive regulator for GM-CSF production , `` and GM-CSF has been shown to play an autocrine role in colony formation . ``
The inhibition of NF- « B by a variety of molecules , such as glucocorticoids , has been proposed as a means of inducing apoptosis in target cell populations .
`` * `` `` The data presented here indicate that NF-kB activation is necessary for general clonogenic response and protects against apoptosis in CD34+* bone marrow cells .
Based on these results , proposed strategies involving inhibition of NF- « B activation as an adjunct to anticancer therapeutic paradigms should be approached with caution .
In addition to the potential role for the NF-KB in regulating hematopoiesis , these proteins are also proto-oncogenes `` and may play a role in the transformation process in several types of cancer .
The avian homologue of c-rel , v-rel , causes the PYATT ET AL tumorigenicity of the avian reticuloendotheliosis virus ( REV-T ) . ``
Human T-lymphotrophic virus-I ( HTLV-I ) -mediated T-cell leukemia is thought to involve constitutive NF-kB activation induced by the tax protein . ``
P50/p65 NF- « B has also been reported to be activated by the p210 BCR-ABL fusion protein that mediates transformation in chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , `` and NF- « B is reportedly a critical downstream element of Ha-Ras signaling and may mediate its oncogenic potential . ``
'' In conclusion , our findings demonstrate that NF- « B ( p50 , p65 , c-rel ) is present in human CD34*CD19~ bone marrow cells and suggest that it is required for colony formation and cell survival .
These results suggest that NF-kB plays an important role in human CD34* cell signal transduction , gene expression , and transformation .
