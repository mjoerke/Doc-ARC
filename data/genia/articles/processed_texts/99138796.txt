Minoru Kawai , ** Naotaka Hamasaki , * Taro Shirakawa , * Julian M. Hopkin , * and Kenji Izuhara* Two variants of the IL-4R « -chain ( IL-4Ra ) gene have been recently identified in association with different atopic disorders .
To clarify the etiological relationship between the two variants , we analyzed responsiveness to IL-4 of transfectants with four kinds of IL-4Ra « carrying either Val or He at 50 and either Gln or Arg at 551 .
The substitution of He for Val augmented STAT6 activation , proliferation , and transcription activity of the Ie promoter by IL-4 , whereas that of Arg for Gin did not change these IL-4 signals .
Arg® `` `` was not associated with atopic asthma in the Japanese population .
CD23 expression and IgE synthesis by IL-4 were augmented in He `` -bearing PBMC , compared with those bearing Val `` ° .
Taken together , substitution of Arg `` does not enhance the IL-4 signal for generation of germline e transcript , whereas the substitution of He° `` contributes to enhancement of IgE synthesis .

E-mail address : kizuhara @ cclm.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp Copyright © 1999 by The American Association of Immunologists gene predisposing to atopy , and by the possibility that several genes interact with a strong environmental component ( 2 ) .
To date , several potential linkages have been reported to correlate with atopy ( 2 ) , among them the IL-4R a-chain ( IL-4Ra® ; Ref .
3 , 4 ) .
IL-4 is a pleiotropic cytokine , essential for IgE synthesis in B cells and differentiation to Th2 phenotype in T cells ( 5 ) .
IL-4 exerts its biological activity by binding to the target cell receptor , which is composed of a heterodimer of IL-4R « and the common y-chain ( 6 ) .
IL-4Ra is a critical component for the binding to IL-4 and signal transduction of IL-4 ( 7-11 ) .
Upon stimulation of IL-4 , Janus tyrosine kinase-1 and 3 are activated , followed by activation of STAT6 , which has a central role in IgE synthesis ( 12-15 ) .
We have recently demonstrated that the substitution of valine ( Val ) at amino acid 50 of human IL-4 ( hIL-4 ) Ra for isoleucine ( Ile ) augments hIL-4 signals in B cell lines , and patients with atopic asthma show high incidence of the substitution ( 16 ) , indicating that the He `` variant of hIL-4Ra causes atopy .
In contrast , another variant of hIL-4Ra carrying arginine ( Arg ) at 551 ( num-bering from the start of mature protein ) instead of glutamine ( Gln ) has also been shown to be correlated with hyper IgE syndrome and severe atopic eczema and to cause up-regulation of CD23 expression and dissociation with a tyrosine-phosphatase , SHP-1 ( 17 ) .
Based on these two studies , two possibilities arise .
One is that these two substitutions act independently to cause atopy .
In this case , an individual bearing both variants would belong to a higher risk group than one who carries each single variant .
The other possibility is that these two polymorphisms are linkage disequi-librium .
In this case , either of these variants simply represents a marker of the other variant .
It is important to address this point , to estimate the quantity of risk of contracting atopic asthma .
In this study , we generated transfectants on which four kinds of hIL-4Ra , carrying either Val or He at 50 and either Gin or Arg at 551 , are expressed , and we analyzed responsiveness to hIL-4 .
We further assessed the genetic association of the substitution Arg551Gin with atopic asthma , and CD23 expression and IgE synthesis induced by hIL-4 in HNeSOVal-bearing PBMC .

Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis to generate mutations of the 223th and 1727th nucleic acid from the first ATG codon were 5'-CTCAGGGATACACCG-3 ' and 5'-CAAACTCCCGATAGCCA-3 ' , whose mutated nucleic acids are under-lined .
Plasmids of these hIL-4Ras were inserted into pME18S , and these plasmids were denoted val `` Gin `` `` , val `` 0Arg55 ' , He `` `` GIn `` `` , and e `` `` respectively .
Construction of transfected B cell line Four kinds of plasmids Val `` ®Arg `` `` , Ne®°Gin `` `` , and Ie `` were transfected by electroporation to a mouse pro-B cell line , Ba/F3 , and drug-resistant and hIL-4-responsive clones were selected , which were denoted BF-Val `` °GIn `` `` , BF—ValsoArgSSI , BF-He `` °GIn* `` `` , and BF-Ne `` °Arg `` `` ' , respectively .
These transfectants were maintained in the presence of mouse IL-3 ( mIL-3 ) kindly provided by Dr. T. Hara , ( Tokyo University , Tokyo , Japan ) , as described previously ( 16 ) .
Extraction of nuclear proteins and electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ( EMSA ) Procedures of extraction of nuclear proteins and EMSA were conducted as previously described ( 19 ) .
Briefly , the cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of either hIL-4 or mIL-4 for 15 min , and then lysed to extract nuclear proteins .
The amounts of loaded nuclear extracts were normalized before mixing .
The oligonucleotide probe used was Ie ( 5-GTCAACTTCCCAA GAACAGAA-3 ' ) .
Luciferase activity assay The plasmid used for the luciferase activity assay was constructed by pGL3-enhancer vector ( Promega , Madison , WI ) into which the promoter region from -187 to +6 of human I€e was inserted .
After the plasmid was electroporated into each transfectant , followed by incubation for 24 h , the cells were further incubated with 2 ng/m !
of either hIL-4 or mIL-4 for 24 h in the presence of mIL-3 .
The cells were washed once by PBS , and then lysed with reporter lysis buffer ( Toyoink , Tokyo , Japan ) and centrifuged to remove debris .
Cell lysates were mixed with luciferse assay reagent ( Toyoink ) .
Binding assay Binding of [ **IJ-labeled hIL-4 ( NEN , Boston , MA ) to the cells was assayed as described before ( 20 ) .
After the cells were incubated with various concentrations of [ **I ] -labeled hIL-4 for 3 h at 4°C , bound and free ligands were separated by centrifugation through an oil gradient .
Nonspecific binding was measured by adding a 150-fold molar excess of nonradiolabeled hIL-4 .
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting Procedures of immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were conducted , as previously described ( 21 ) .
The cells lysed in the lysis buffer containing 1 % Triton X-100 were immunoprecipitated with anti-hIL-4Ra mAb that was provided by Schering-France ( Dardilly , France ) .
Proteins eluted by boiling with SDS-PAGE sample buffer were applied to SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Proteins were probed with anti-hIL-4Ra mAb ( Genzyme , Cambridge , MA ) and visualized by enhanced chemi-luminescence ( Amersham ) .
Genetic analysis All the asthmatic subjects had been diagnosed by physicians specializing in asthma , with 1 ) recurrent breathlessness and chest tightness requiring ongoing treatment , 2 ) physician-documented wheeze , and 3 ) documented la-bile airflow obstruction with variability in serial peak expiratory flow rates > 30 % .
Specific IgE was detected by MAST ( Hitachi , Tokyo , Japan ) , as previously described ( 22 ) .
Atopy was diagnosed as the presence of high concentration of total serum IgE , a positive specific IgE titer against one or more of 15 highly purified aeroallergens or a combination of these two features .
DNA samples were extracted using a commercial kit ( IsoQuick , Mi-croprobe , Garden Grove , WA ) .
The PCR reaction was performed with 100 ng of genomic DNA as template after an initial 5 min denaturation at 94°C , CUTTING EDGE followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s , 60°C for 30 s , and 72°C for 15 s. The primers to detect HMeSOVal were 5'-GAAGCCCACACGTGTA for e `` `` , 5-GAAGCCCACACGTGTG for Val `` `` , and GAAGGAG .
The primers for Arg551GIn were 5 `` -GTCTCGGCCCCCAC CACCGGCTATC and 5'-ACCCAAGCCCACCACCGCACT .
Underlined nucleotides were exchanged to incorporate the polymorphic site into a Bsil recognition site .
All three genotypes for each substitution were confirmed by sequencing randomly selected from each genotype .
The whole data set was scored blind .
Measurement of CD23 expression and IgE , synthesis Heparinized blood samples were collected from 10 adult volunteers , all of who were ascertained not to have any allergic history , to show normal serum IgE level , and to be negative in a radioallergosorbent test for airborn allergens .
PBMC was isolated by Ficoll-sodium metrizoate sedimentation ( Organon Teknika , Durham , NC ) .
Genotype of HNeSOVal was confirmed by sequencing .
Measurement of CD23 expression on CD20+* B cells was analyzed , as described before ( 23 ) .
PBMC incubated in the presence or absence of 2.5 ng/ml hIL-4 for 48 h were incubated with biotinylated anti-CD23 mAb , followed by incubation with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin and FITC-conjugated anti-CD20 mAb ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) .
Iso-type-matched control mAbs were used for a negative staining .
Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan using a gate for CD20* B cells .
Measurement of IgE synthesis was conducted as described before ( 24 ) .
After PBMC were incubated in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml hIL-4 for 14 days , IgE in culture supernatants was measured by a solid-phase RIA , and net IgE synthesis was calculated by subtracting the value of preformed IgE .
To estimate preformed IgE , both 50 ug/ml of cyclohexi-mide and 10 pg/ml of puromycin were added .
Results and Discussion STAT6 activation of the variants It has been shown that STAT6 has a central role for germline e transcript induced by IL-4 , based on studies of the promoter region of Ie , and STAT6-disruption mice ( 12-15 ) .
We have also shown that the He `` variant augmented STAT6 activation induced by IL-4 ( 16 ) .
For this reason , we analyzed STAT6 activation induced by hIL-4 in the variants to investigate whether activation of a signal-transducing molecule for generation of germline e transcript is enhanced by the Arg551GIn variant .
The STAT6 activities in BF-Ne `` °Gin `` `` ' and BF-Ile `` °Arg `` `` ' were up-regulated compared with those of and BF-Val `` °Arg > `` ' , as judged by image analyzer ( Fig .
14 ; 1.6- and 1.8-fold , the averages of three experiments , respectively ) , whereas those of BF-Val `` °Arg `` `` ' and BF-Ne `` Arg `` `` * were invariable with those of BF-Val `` °Gin `` `` ' and BF-NMe `` `` GIn `` `` ' ( Fig .
14 ; 0.8- and 0.9-fold , the averages of three experiments , respectively ) .
There was no difference of the STAT6 activities induced by mIL-4 ( Fig .
1B ) .
These results confirmed our previous finding that STAT6 activation by hIL-4 is increased by Ne `` ° variant ( 16 ) .
As Khurana Hershey et al .
stated , it is unlikely that the substitution Arg551GIn influences STAT6 activation ( 17 ) .
Transcription activity of the I¢ promoter of the variants In our previous study , it was demonstrated that the He `` variant up-regulates the transcription activity of the Ie promoter by hIL-4 ( 16 ) .
Although Arg551GIn does not influence STAT6 activation , it would be still possible that this substitution augments the transcription activity of the Ie promoter , through another pathway independent of that of Jak/STAT .
To address this point , we next measured luciferase activity induced by hIL-4 and mIL-4 in the variants .
We first analyzed the proliferation activity of the variants by hIL-4 .
The proliferations by hIL-4 in BF-Ile `` °GIn° `` ' and BF-Ne `` were up-regulated compared with BF-Val `` °Gin `` `` ' and BF-Val `` ®Arg `` `` `` ( Fig .
24 ; 1.5- and 1.9-fold , respectively ) .
The proliferations of BF-Val `` °Gin `` `` ' and BF-Val `` ®Arg `` `` ' , or of BF-Ne `` °GIn `` `` ' and BF-lle `` °Arg `` `` ' , were almost the same ( Fig .
24 ) , and the proliferations by mIL-4 in the variants were invariable 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology hIL-4 _ ~ FIGURE 1 .

Based on these results , we performed the luciferase assay in the presence of mIL-3 to normalize the analyzed cells .
The relative transcription activities in BE-Ile `` °Gin `` `` ' and induced by hIL-4 were higher than those of BF-Val `` °GIn° `` ' and BF-Val `` ®Arg `` `` ' ( Fig .

The relative luciferase activity was estimated , compared with the value in the absence of IL-4 .
Each experiment was done with two samples , and the mean values of three experiments are shown .

It has been unclear how Arg551GIn is involved in the pathogenesis of hyper IgE syndrome and severe eczema .
Because it has been shown that IL-4 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of various intracellular proteins ( 21 ) , further studies focused on identifying the target of SHP-1 , whose association with IL-4Ra is less in Arg `` `` * type than in Gin® `` ' type , would be useful .
Binding activity and hIL-4Ra expression of the variants In our previous study , we demonstrated that the NeSOVal variant does not influence the binding affinity of hIL-4Ra with hIL-4 ( 16 ) .
We next performed the binding assay using the variants .
The values of K , , were not varied by the substitution NeSOVal , as described previously , whereas the substitution Arg551GIn slightly increased the values of K , ( Fig .
3A ; BF-Val `` °GIn `` `` ' , BF-Val `` Arg `` `` ' , BF-Ne `` °GIn* `` ' , and BF-NMle `` °Arg `` `` * : 1.3 X 10 , 2.3 X 10 , 1.5 X 10 , and 2.1 X 10 pM , respectively ) .
These results suggest that higher responsiveness to hIL-4 in the Ile `` type is not explained by higher affinity of the receptor with hIL-4 in that type .

To date , the mechanism by which the Ne `` variant up-regulates the hIL-4 signals remains unresolved .
As for mIL-4Ra , the substitution of threonine ( Thr ) at amino acid 49 to Ile enhances dissociation of mIL-4 from mIL-4R « a , probably by abrogating one N-glycosylation site ( 25 ) .
Although NeSOVal is not involved in glycosylation of hIL-4Ra , it would be possible that Thr49lle of mIL-4Ra « and NeSOVal of hIL-4Ra cause up-regula- A A MFI ( IL-4 - Fresh ) FIGURE 4 .

In contrast , Arg551GIn genotype frequency was invariable in all three kinds of classification .
These results indicate that the incidence of NeSOVal , but not Arg551GIn , is correlated with atopic asthma and that there is no linkage disequilibrium between these substitutions .
Arg551Gln may be specifically associated with hyper IgE syndrome and severe atopic eczema or may be specific to Caucasians , although there has been a conflicting result ( 26 ) .
Expression of CD23 and production of IgE in PBMC genotyped in amino acid 50 Our previous ( 16 ) and present studies have verified that the Ie `` variant amplifies the IL-4 signals concerned with generation of germline e transcript , and have shown high incidence in patients with atopic asthma .
To elucidate whether He `` `` -bearing PBMCs respond strongly to exogenous hIL-4 compared with Val `` -bearing cells , we assessed expression of CD23 and production of IgE induced by IL-4 , using PBMCs whose genotypes were confirmed as homozygotes of either Ile `` or Val `` ° .
The genotype of amino acid at 551 was a homozygote of Gin in all of the investigated donors .
When either Ne `` °- or Val `` -bearing PBMCs from each of five donors were stimulated by hIL-4 , CD23 expression induced by hIL-4 on CD20* B cells was slightly higher in the Ile `` `` type than the Val `` type ( Fig .
44 ; the mean AMFI 957 vs 616 , respectively ) , and IgE production induced by hIL-4 in the Ile `` `` type was three times as high as the Val `` type ( Fig .
4B ; 8.5 vs 2.8 ng/ml , respectively ) .
These results were compatible with our previous and present results using B cell lines and based on genetic study , indicating that Ne `` variant enhanced the transducing signal for IgE synthesis , in not only in vitro , but also in intact B cells .
Further-more , it would also be possible that He `` variant augments Th2 differentiation induced by IL-4 , in synergy with the variant 's effect on B cells , increasing IgE synthesis in PBMC by IL-4 .
Elucidation of this point is awaited .
