The minimal promoter necessary for this expression lies proximal , between -300 and the transcription start site .
We had previously shown that activation of the arylhydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) , a member of the bHLH-PAS family of transcription factors , leads to increased mRNA expression of IL-2 in murine fetal thymocytes .
The AHR is abundant in the thymus and may play a role for the development of the immune system .
Moreover , its overactivation by chemicals such as dioxins leads to immunosuppression and thymic involution .
Binding motifs for the liganded AHR can be identified in the distal region -1300 to -800 of the mouse IL-2 promoter .
We show here that these DNA motifs , the so-called dioxin response elements , after binding to the liganded AHR are sufficient to transactivate luciferase expression in a reporter gene system .
The IL-2 gene can be induced by the AHR also in thymocytes in vivo after injection of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin , a potent ligand of the AHR .
The AHR mediates the IL-2 induction as shown with AHR-deficient mice .
However , in spleen cells in vitro costimulation via the TCR is necessary for optimal IL-2 gene induction .
Thus , the IL-2 promoter region contains novel distal regulatory elements that can be addressed by the AHR to induce IL-2 and can cooperate with the proximal promoter in this .

, it is tissue restricted and responsive to stimulation by Ags or other stimuli .
Studies investigating the IL-2 promoter have focussed on the proximal regulatory elements .
The region extending to -300 has been identified as a minimal promoter sufficient for expression of IL-2 in response to antigenic stimulation via the TCR plus costimulatory signals such as interaction of CD28 and B7 ( 1 ) .
The more distal regions have received less attention , albeit in the original publication of the region extending -2800 bp upstream of the transcription site , several distal regulatory stretches had been described ( Ref .
2 ; see also Fig .

The arylhydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor of the basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS family ( 3 , 4 ) .
These evolutionarily conserved proteins are involved in organo-genesis , cell rhythm , and detoxification ( 5 ) .

Copyright © 2000 by The American Association of Immunologists carbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) and related compounds can bind and activate the AHR , which then mediates a variety of toxic responses .
Depending on the dose of the activating ligand , these responses can vary from inmnmunosuppression , thymic involution , endocrine disruption , and tumor promotion , to interference with fatty acid metabolism and cell differentiation ( 6-9 ) .
Although the exact mechanisms of the various toxic responses are not known , aberrant induction of genes has been assumed to be a major factor in toxicity .
Upon ligand binding , the AHR releases its chaperoning heat shock protein 90 , translocates into the nucleus , and dimerizes with AHR nuclear translocator ( ARNT ) ( 10 ) .
The heterodimeric AHR-ARNT complex binds to a short DNA motif termed DRE ( dioxin response element , also known as AHRE or XRE ) and alters the transcription of genes controlled by DREs .
Potential DREs are found in many genes ( 11 ) , and functional studies on cytochrome P-4501A1 have been pivotal in understanding the action of dioxins in gene induction ( 12-14 ) .
It is conceivable that cytokines are important in mediating the biological outcome of AHR overactivation in the immune system , in particular the immunosuppressive effects and effects on thymus development .
Expression of several cytokine mRNAs was shown to be inducible by TCDD ( 15 , 16 ) .
IL-2 , which is comparatively strongly inducible , is produced by T cells and has central functions for growth and differentiation of T cells , B cells , NK cells , and macrophages ( 17 ) .
IL-2 is mandatory for the homeostasis of T cells ( 18 ) .
However , the direct transcriptional control of a gene of the immune system by the AHR has not been shown until now .
Here , we demonstrate that the TCDD-activated AHR can directly bind to and transduce the distal region of the IL-2 promoter , revealing its previously unknown enhancing function .
Depending on the T cell maturation stage and , in some circumstances , costimulation , IL-2 will be expressed upon ligand activation of the AHR in thymus and spleen cells .

All animals were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions .
For in vivo exposure , TCDD ( purity > 99 % ; Oekometric GmbH , Bayreuth , Germany ) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted in sterile corn oil to 5 ug/ml .
Mice were injected i.p .
with a single dose of 50 ug TCDD/kg body weight .
Control mice received DMSO/corn oil .
At posttreatment days 3 , 6 , and 8 , mice were killed by asphyxiation , and RNA was extracted from thymi and spleens with TRIzol according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
RNA was reverse transcribed by standard procedures .
Before RNA extraction , erythrocytes were depleted from spleen cells by hypotonic lysis .
Primary cell cultures RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 % FCS , 5 X 10~* M 2-ME , 100 U/ml penicillin , and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin was used as medium throughout .
TCDD was diluted in 1,4-dioxane ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) and added to the medium at a final concentration of 10 nM in 0.1 % solvent .
Anti-CD3e was coated onto six-well plates , and 10-13 X 10° thymocytes or 5-7 X 10° spleen cells from adult animals were added in 2 ml medium with 10 nM TCDD or solvent alone .
After 4 h , RNA was isolated for RT-PCR .
In other experiments , supernatants were taken after the indicated incubation times with anti-CD3e , and IL-2 content was measured by ELISA ( Mouse ELISA kit ; Endogen , Woburn , MA ) .
Alternatively , fetal thymus lobes from mice at gestation day 15 were excised , freed of adhering tissue , and cultivated on nitrocellulose filters set in a well with 300 pl medium plus or minus 10 nM TCDD as described before ( 19-21 ) .
Control lobes were cultivated in medium plus 0.1 % solvent alone .
At 4 or 5 days of culture , single-cell suspensions were prepared , and RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed .
For analysis of thymocyte subpopulations , CD4~CD8~ , CD4*CD8* , CD4~CD8* , and CD4*CD8~ thymocytes were sorted on a FACS440 cell sorter ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) after staining with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 Abs ( PharMingen , Hamburg , Germany ) .
RT-PCR assays Semiquantitative RT-PCR assays were performed as previously described ( 15 ) .
Total RNA ( 1 ug ) was used for cDNA synthesis with mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) reverse transcriptase .
[ a-*~P ] -labeled CTP was added during RT-PCR .
HPRT ( hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase ; Ref .
22 ) , a housekeeping gene , was amplified together with the cDNA of IL-2 in the same reaction tube .
To analyze the amplification of both cDNAs in the linear range , the `` primer-dropping `` method ( 23 ) was used to calibrate for the different expression levels of HPRT vs IL-2 cDNAs .
Briefly , the cDNA for the IL-2 test were first amplified for several cycles ( depend-ing on their previously established abundance ) , and then HPRT primers were dropped into the reaction tubes followed by an additional 25 cycles .
PCR products were separated on 10 % polyacrylamide gels .
Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography .
The primer sequences , the annealing temperature , and cycles for RT-PCR are shown in Table I .
The autoradiographs were analyzed with an OmniMedia scanner and the whole-band analysis program ( Bio Image system ; Millipore , Bedford , MA ) .
Quantifi-cation was performed on autoradiographs in the linear range of radioactivity to photosensitivity .
PCR experiments for each gene expression were performed at least two times with similar results ; for data presentation , one representative experiment is shown .
EMSA Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized , annealed , and end-labeled with [ y- `` `` P ] ATP .
Sequences of oligonucleotides are shown in Table II .
Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins from an ARR `` mouse thymic epithelial cell line , ET ( a gift from Ronald Palacios , Basel Institute of Immunology , Basel , Switzerland ; Ref .
24 ) , were prepared ( 25 ) and EMSA were essentially performed as described ( 26 ) .
Briefly , 15 ug of nuclear proteins were incubated with 30,000 cpm end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides for 20 min in a final volume of 15 pl .
Binding reactions were conducted in 25 mM HEPES , pH 7.5 ; 1 mM EDTA ; 0.7 mM DTT ; 0.5 mM PMSF ; 10 % glycerol ; and 156 mM KCI .
Samples were preincubated for 10 min in the presence of 1 ug poly d ( LC ) d ( I : C ) and 0.5 g salmon sperm DNA .
A 200-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was used in specific and nonspecific competition experiments .
AHR-DRE complexes were separated on 4 % ( w/v ) polyacrylamide gels in TGE buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 380 mM glycin , 2 mM EDTA , pH 8.5 ) .
Gels were transferred to Whatman 3 MM paper ( Bio-Rad , Munich , Germany ) , dried , and auto-radiographed .
For supershift analyses , the nuclear protein extract and labeled oligonucleotide were incubated with 1 or 3 pl of anti-AHR Ab ( Di-anova , Hamburg , Germany ) for 10 min at room temperature before gel electrophoresis .
Plasmid constructs , transfection , and luciferase assays The plasmid constructs used in this study were as follows : pGudLuc 1.0 , a reporter plasmid containing the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the MMTV promoter ; pGudLuc 1.1 , produced by cloning five DREs ( -1301 to -819 ) isolated from the CYPIAI promoter of mouse into the MMTV promoter of pGudLuc 1.0 ( both plasmids were gifts from Michael Denison , University of California at Davis ; Ref .
29 ) and used as positive control in all assays ; pMMTV-IL-2-DRE ( O.5 ) , produced by cloning the Esp3 1-Sspl fragment spanning -1296 to -756 of the 5 ' region of the ZL-2 gene and containing the three DREs into the Bg/I site within the MMTV promoter of the pGudluec 1.0 vector ; pDRE ( O.5 ) MutI/III and pDRE ( O.5 ) MutIII , in these plasmids , point mutations of the DREII/III or only DREIII had been introduced into the core recognition sites of pMTV-IL-2-DRE ( 0.5 ) ; pDRE I , pDRE II , and pDRE III , complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides ( 50 bases ) encoding two copies of each DRE of IL-2 promoter and were synthesized , annealed , and cloned into the Bg/lI site of pGudluc 1.0 ( Table III ) .
The DNA sequences of the oligonucleotides are shown in Table III ( the core recognition sequence for the DRE motifs is in bold print ) ; pSV-IL-2-DRE ( O0.5 ) and pTK-IL-2DRE ( O.5 ) , the IL-2 fragment -1296 to -756 was cloned into the pGL3P vector in front of the SV40 promoter or TK promoter ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , respectively .
pSV-IL-2-DRE ( O.1 ) , the BstEII to Nsil fragment ( 400 bp ) between DRE I and DRE II of the IL-2 5 `` region , was deleted from pSV-IL-2-DRE ( O.5 ) .
All plasmids were examined by sequencing .
Expression of AHR and its dimerization partner ARNT , both necessary for TCDD-mediated gene transactivation , was verified by RT-PCR in the human HepG2 hepatoma cells and in mouse lines Hepa C1 , Hepa C12 , and Hepa C4 ( gifts from Oliver Hankinson , University of California at Los Angeles ) .
Cells were grown in culture medium with 10 % FCS .
Cells ( 5 % 10° ) were cultured overnight in six-well plates .
Cells were washed twice with PBS and transfected with 2 pug plasmid DNA ( pGudLuc 1.0 , pMMTV-IL-2-DRE ( O.5 ) , the point mutation derivatives thereof , pDRE I , pDRE II , pDRE III , pSV-IL-2-DRE ( 0.5 ) , pSV-IL-2-DRE ( 0.1 ) , or pGudluc 1.1 ) .
Transfections were performed with 8 ug transfectam ( Promega ) in 1 ml RPMI 1640 .
After 8 h , 4 ml complete culture medium were added .
Cells were cultured for another 16 h before adding 10 nM TCDD or solvent alone .
After 14-16 h , cells were lysed , and luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer ( LP96 P-Luminometer ; Berthold , Nashua , NH ) .
Results were normalized to the amount of total protein in the cell lysate , measured by the Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) .

Bold letters designated the actual CACGC AHR contact site , underlined letters deviate from the consensus sequence ( 14 ) .
For mutation experiments , the last C in CACGC was changed to a T. thymocytes .
Except TNF-a , these cytokines contain consensus sequence of DREs in the published upstream region of their respective genes ( 11 ) .
The IL-2 gene has three potential DRE sites at -1261 , -851 , and -815 bp .
We decided to test the three DREs of the IL-2 distal promoter region for direct interaction and inducibility by the liganded AHR .
Expression of AHR and its dimerization partner ARNT , both necessary for TCDD-mediated gene transactivation , was verified by RT-PCR in the ET thymic epithelial cell line ( data not shown ) .
Also , expression of CYPIAI , a known TCDD-responsive gene ( 3 , 12 ) , was inducible by TCDD in this cell line , indicating the functionality of the endogenous AHR and ARNT proteins ( data not shown ) .
Nuclear extracts of ET cells , containing the AHR/ARNT complex , did bind to labeled IL-2-DRE-oligonucleotides only when treated with TCDD but not with solvent alone ( Fig .
1A ) .
No specific AHR binding was observed with cytoplasmic protein , indicating that TCDD-dependent dimerization of AHR and ARNT takes place in the nucleus ( Fig .
1B ) .
Specificity of binding was demonstrated by competition experiments using unlabeled ZL-2-DRE oligonucleotides or the DRE of CYPIA1 ( Fig .
1A , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Binding was not inhibited with oligo-DNA of an unrelated sequence ( Fig .
14 , lane 5 ) .
Preincuba-tion of the mixture of nuclear extracts and DREs with anti-AHR Abs led to the expected supershift of the complex ( Fig .
1A , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
The three DREs differed in their binding capacity .
In particular , the binding of DRE I was much weaker than that of DRE II and DRE IIL .
This is in agreement with the deviation from the published consensus sequence 5'-T G/C G/T CACGC N C/A-3 ' ( 14 ) , which is three base pair for DRE I , but only two for DRE II and DRE III ( see Table II ) .
Still , the core sequence , to which the AHR/ARNT/TCDD complex makes physical contact ( 14 , 28 ) , is unchanged in all three DREs .
Note that DRE I binds to proteins of an unknown nature , albeit this complex is not shifted by TCDD treatment .
The IL-2 distal region contains enhancer elements responsive to TCDD To test whether TCDD leads to transactivation of the AHR on the IL-2-DREs , we transiently transfected hepatoma cells with pM-MTV-IL-2-DRE , a reporter plasmid containing luciferase under the control of the -1296 to -756 region of the 5 ' IL-2 gene .
We then measured the induction of luciferase activity ( Fig .
2 ) .
Hepatoma cells were used because of unresolvable technical difficulties in efficiently transfecting primary T cells or thymocytes ; T cell hybridomas lost AHR expression during prolonged cultivation .
We observed that this distal IL-2 promoter region induced expression of luciferase in the presence of TCDD .
The induction of transcription increased ~13 times compared with the background .
In com-parison , transcription from pGudlue 1.1 ( 29 ) , which contains five DREs from CYPIAI , a gene highly sensitive to TCDD , was induced ~20-fold ( Fig .
24 ) .
Similar results were obtained when using vectors containing either an SV40 or : minimal promoter .
These vectors yielded different backgrounds , yet always easily detectable TCDD induced luciferase expression ( Fig .
2C ) .
Thus , the far distal region of the IL-2 promoter contains DNA sequences highly responsive to TCDD .
We then introduced single point mutations into the core recognition sites of the DREs II and III in the pMMTV-IL-2-DRE ( O.5 ) plasmid , transfected cells , and measured luciferase activity .
When both DRE II and III sites are mutated the luciferase induction by TCDD is abrogated .
A mutation in the DRE III only reduced the response but did not completely abrogate it ( Fig .
24 ) .
Thus , the DREs are necessary elements and both elements are required for a full response ( Fig .
2 ) .
There is no other , hidden AHR-responsive element in the 500-bp distal enhancer segment .
However , as shown in Fig .
3 , the distal IL-2 promoter region has possible AP-1 binding sites , but they have not been demonstrated to be used for the IL-2 enhancer/promoter .
It is known that the liganded AHR may induce c-jun and c-fos , creating AP-1 ( 30 ) .
To supply further evidence that DREs are responsible for the IL-2 induction , we cloned each of the three DREs separately into the pGudlue vector ( see Fig .
2B ) , and tested them for promoter activity by TCDD in HepG2 cells .
The results shown in Fig .
2B demonstrate that each of the three isolated ZL-2-DREs can drive luciferase transcription in the presence of TCDD , demonstrating the tran-scription-enhancing capacity of these small DNA elements .
The same results were obtained with pSV-IL-2DRE ( O.1 ) in which the putative AP-1 sites between DRE I and DRE II are deleted ( Fig .
2C , Table IV ) .
Again , DRE I exhibits a distinctly weaker response , which agrees with the results obtained from the gel shift assay .
Thus , at least DRE II and III do not need the context of other sequences of the IL-2 distal region to be functional as promoter elements .
To verify that the induction is AHR dependent , we performed the same assay in AHR- or ARNT-deficient cell lines Hepa C12 and Hepa C4 , and wild-type Hepa C1 .
The results shown in Table IV demonstrate that functional AHR as well as ARNT are necessary for induction driven by ZL-2-DREs .
Also , in AHR-deficient mice , IL-2 was not induced by TCDD ( see below ) .
Induction of IL-2 mRNA by TCDD depends on the differentiation stage of T cells Most eukaryotic promoters have various modules that cooperate adaptively to generate differentiation- and situation-specific responses .
Consequently , modules that are inducible in in vitro assays could be not accessible or not relevant in vivo .
Therefore , we tested induction of IL-2 by TCDD in several maturational stages of 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6978 IL-2 DISTAL PROMOTER ELEMENTS REGULATED BY AH RECEPTOR Table III .

All cells described here could respond to TCDD with CYPIAI induction , which indicates a functional AHR/ARNT system ( data not shown ) .
In a first series of experiments , mice were injected with 50 pg TCDD , and their thymocytes were analyzed 3 , 6 , or 8 days later by RT-PCR .
We observed an IL-2 mRNA induction in vivo , suggesting that the DREs in the IL-2 promoter can be addressed ( Fig .
44 ) .
To assess whether IL-2 induction is dependent on the differentiation stage of cells , we next set up fetal thymus organ cultures ( FTOC 's ) .
Fetal thymi were excised and exposed to TCDD for 4 or 5 days .
Thymocytes were isolated and sorted to high purity by CD4/CD8 expression for very immature ( CD4 CD8 ) , immature ( CD4 * ) , prospective helper T cells ( CD4 *CD8~ ) , and prospective cytotoxic T cells ( CD4~-CD8 * ) .
IL-2 mRNA induction was measured by RT-PCR .
As shown in Fig .
4B , TCDD increased IL-2 mRNA in total thymocytes , confirming previously published results ( 15 ) .
The overall increase was attributable to the immature CD4 cells and future cytotoxic * cells , both of which responded to TCDD exposure with a strong ( ~3- and 5-fold ) increase of IL-2 mRNA .
CD4 ~CD8~ cells displayed a constitutive expression of IL-2 .
However , they also increased IL-2 mRNA by TCDD .
CD4*CD8* thymocytes , which constitute the majority of thymocytes , remained refractory to TCDD .
Moreover , A IL-2 induction by TCDD could not be detected in spleen cells , a source of naive , fully mature T cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , IL-2 induction by TCDD is dependent on the maturation stage of thy-mocytes/T cells , and the responsiveness of the promoter can be switched on and off during maturation of T cells .
TCDD is not sufficient for IL-2 induction in spleen cells but can be complemented by anti-CD3€ signaling Induction of IL-2 in T cells classically requires two signals , one from the TCR , and another from the surface receptor CD28 .
Their dual triggering leads to a cascade of events , eventually generating and activating components like c-jun and c-fos complex ( AP-1 ) , NFAT , and NF-KB , which transactivate the promoter ( 2 ) .
Because TCDD alone was not sufficient to induce IL-2 production in mature splenic T cells , we stimulated thymus and spleen cells in six-well plates with anti-CD3¢e Ab , mimicking TCR triggering .
Like spleen cells from in vivo exposed mice , spleen cells exposed in vitro could not be induced by TCDD alone ( Fig .
54 ) .
IL-2 mRNA became inducible by TCDD in spleen cells only upon cross-linking with anti-CD3e Ab .
Induction was consistently about 4 times over the untreated controls , but there was a threshold of 100 ng of anti-CD3e necessary for the stimulation .
The induction of IL-2 mRNA was readily detectable within 4 h , i.e .
, no cell division was DREs < d { free DREs DRE 1 ( 1261 ) DRE II ( -851 ) DRE III ( -815 ) FIGURE 1 .

necessary .
Also , in thymocytes , where IL-2 mRNA had been induced by TCDD alone in vivo ( Fig .
4 ) , additional signaling via the TCR augmented IL-2 mRNA in vitro ( Fig .
5B ) .
To address whether IL-2 mRNA induction leads to protein syn-thesis , we analyzed supernatants from anti-CD3e-stimulated cultures by ELISA for IL-2 protein ( Fig .
6 ) .
Exposure of the cells to TCDD increased IL-2 protein synthesis compared with the solvent controls , but a higher concentration of anti-CD3e costimulation than for mRNA induction was needed to detect this .
The IL-2 protein production lagged several hours compared with IL-2 mRNA induction , suggesting new protein synthesis .
At least for spleen cells , cell density during stimulation and age of mice seemed to be important parameters for the strength of the response , as IL-2 induction varied depending on culture conditions ( data not shown ) .
The Ah receptor is necessary for IL-2 induction by TCDD in vivo The reporter assays described above strongly suggested that the IL-2 promoter is activated via the TCDD-liganded AHR at its distal DREs .
To rule out a gene-inducing mechanism of TCDD not involving the AHR , we injected AHR-deficient mice with 50 pg TCDD/kg body weight .
After 6 days , thymus cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated .
IL-2 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR .
As shown in Fig .
7 , IL-2 mRNA induction by TCDD is detected in thymus cells from AkR*'* and AkR*~ but not in thymus cells from AkR '~ mice .
Thus , the IL-2 mRNA induction by TCDD is mediated by the Ah receptor .
Discussion In this paper we present evidence for functional DNA motifs in the distant IL-2 promoter , which confer inducibility by the liganded AHR in mouse T lineage cells .
As ligand we used TCDD , which is considered to be one of the most potent man-made toxic sub-stances .
The AHR mediates acute and chronic biological effects of TCDD , including immunosuppression and changes in T cell development .
However , the mechanisms for AHR-mediated pathological responses are not well understood .
Targeting cytokines as central mediators of immune responses could be one such mech-anism .
Apart from these toxicological considerations , our study was aimed at understanding the role of the AHR in the complex treatment .
Fold induction by TCDD is the ratio of the relative luciferase activities in TCDD- vs solvent-treated samples .
Results are expressed as mean + SEM of triplicate samples .

regulation of the IL-2 gene .
IL-2 promoter activity is regulated by a number of elements , i.e .
, Oct-1 , NFAT , NF-KB , and AP-1 , which cooperate and thus confer the lineage specificity and external regulation of IL-2 .
Others and we had shown that IL-2 expression could be induced by TCDD , i.e .
, the AHR ( 15 , 31 , 32 ) .
Extending these findings , our analysis of IL-2 induction in subpopulations of thymocytes showed that TCDD can induce IL-2 mRNA in CD4TCD8~ , CD4 ~CD8* , and CD4 ~CD8~ , but not in CD4 `` CD8 * cells .
Some transcription factors for IL-2 expression , Oct-1 , Sp-1 , NF- « B , and cAMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) , can be expressed or induced in thymocytes of all developmental stages .
In contrast , two essential transcription factors , AP-1 and NFAT , are absent in CD4 ~CD8* cells .
IL-2 is shut off during this maturational phase and only becomes accessible again later on ( 33 , 34 ) .
TCDD can not override this complete inaccessi-bility .
Note that in the same cells , CYP1A1 mRNA remained inducible by TCDD ( data not shown ) .

IL-2 DISTAL PROMOTER ELEMENTS REGULATED BY AH RECEPTOR In contrast to thymocytes , TCDD alone was not sufficient to induce IL-2 in naive T cells , but needed stimulation via the TCR as an additional signal .
Again , this is in agreement with findings in the rat , where TCDD could increase serum levels of IL-2 only after synergistic injections of staphylococcus enterotoxin B injections ( 31 ) .
In contrast to thymus , most spleen T cells are resting and thus are unable to express IL-2 .
Stimulation via the TCR/CD3 pathway alone triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways ( Raf-1 , extracellular signal-related kinase ) .
Together with CD28 costimulation , different pathways are activated and the signal cascades merge and eventually lead to AP-1 formation and IL-2 expression ( 35 ) .
Activation of the AHR can bypass the need for CD28 cosignaling , probably in that an alternative signal transduc-tion pathway downstream of the TCR/CD3 is used .
Apart from the direct transcriptional activation shown here , other possibilities of the AHR to interfere with the `` normal `` cell signaling exist .
A recent study by Tian et al .
( 36 ) demonstrated physical interaction of the AHR with NF-KB , leading to mutual repression in their system .
Upon exposure to TCDD , c-jun , c-fos , and c-Jun N-ter-minal kinase induction has been observed in hepatoma cell lines ( 37 , 30 ) and in Jurkat cells ( 38 ) .
Thus , indirect up-regulation of IL-2 by TCDD via these factors is possible .
However , we found that in thymocytes c-jun is not inducible by TCDD ( data not shown ) , favoring the direct transcriptional activation of IL-2 in these cells .
Thus , the AHR is not a strong transcription factor in itself , but rather a modulator that may need the correct cellular set-up for its function .
Although it can act in thymocytes without coactivation , in peripheral T cells it needed additional stimuli , i.e .
, TCR/CD3 triggering .
It is interesting to note that the AHR is particularly abundant in thymus epithelium and thymocytes ( 39 ) , pointing to a physiological role in this tissue .
Also , the fact that TCDD did not induce IL-2 mRNA in AHR-deficient mice clearly demonstrated that the AHR mediated this effect .

After 4 h , total RNA was isolated , and IL-2 mRNA and HPRT were measured by RT-PCR .
Shown are autoradiographs and the calculated densitometric indices of IL-2 vs HPRT .
DNA motifs , which are targets for the AHR/ARNT complex , have been early identified , and a consensus sequence was inferred from a number of DREs in different genes and species .
A core sequence within the consensus sequence , which is indispensable for AHR/ARNT contact , has been mapped ( 14 ) .
The DREs , which we identified in the upstream IL-2 region by computer analysis , were functionally tested with EMSA and a luciferase reporter gene assay .
Band shift analysis showed that the TCDD-activated AHR binds to DRE II and III , and only very weakly to DRE I .
Likewise , in the transfection assay , luciferase induction was higher with DRE II and DRE III than with DRE I .
Most likely this reflects the similarity to the consensus sequence .
DRE I differs from this functional consensus sequence in three base pairs , whereas DRE II and III have only two base pair deviations .
Moreover , DRE II and III have bidirectional core sequences , which are reportedly particularly responsive to TCDD ( 14 ) .
It is less likely that the broader context of other DNA sequences is important , as our luciferase experiments with the bare DRE sequences imply .
Mutation of the DREs abrogated the response , demonstrating that there is no other hidden DRE in the 500-bp distal region we analyzed .
Also , both DRE II and III are needed for a full response .
Even mutating just one of them stopped the induction of the reporter gene ; only a small rest activity remained .
Generally , very little is known about synergistic or antagonistic effects of spatial distribution of transcription factor binding elements , which may be crucial in promoter regulation .
Most functionally investigated DREs are located between -1200 and -800 bp in the upstream regions of the CYPIA1 from mice , rats , and humans ( 40-42 ) .
Interestingly , the ZL-2-DREs were also located between -1200 and -800 bp in the upstream region , and many potential DREs in a number of genes are located in very distal positions ( 11 ) .
Possibly , the distance is functionally important , such that chromatin structure is changed and serves as a stable nucleation site for enhancer-promoter communication and chromatin remodeling , as has been suggested for other genes ( 43 ) .
Ward and colleagues have analyzed this by mapping of DNasel hypersensitivity sites for the IL-2 promoter , albeit only until -730 .
They demonstrated the importance of upstream regions for chro- matin remodeling and gene accessibility ( 44 ) .
It would be interesting to perform similar studies on the even further upstream region and to analyze remodeling under the influence of the AHR/ ARNT complex in a tissue-specific setting .
This could also help to understand data conceived from cat reporter assays in ELAE1 cells , indicating a negative regulatory role of the -700 to -1000 region ( Fig .
3 ) .
In the context of AHR/ARNT activation , this negative regulation might be inverted .
Also in humans a few DRE consensus sequences can be found in the very far 5 ' region ( e.g .
, at -7324 , -3528 , -3398 , -2735 , -2354 ) ; however , no functional data are available .
The human and mouse distal IL-2 promoter have many features in common , but expression levels differed in the careful analysis of isolated sequences in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assays done by Novak et al .
( 2 ) .
The 500-bp stretch we analyzed here has only little homology to the human IL-2 upstream region ( 2 ) .
It is impossible to say at this time whether the human IL-2 promoter would also be responsive to AHR .

( 10 ) .
Our data are consistent with this because TCDD can not induce IL-2 expression in ARNT-deficient cell lines .
Interestingly , when we searched for a suitable cell line for the transfection experiments , we could not find any T cell line that expresses high levels of AHR .
In contrast , all tested T cell lines constitutively expressed ARNT .
Thymocytes and thymic epithelium contained AHR in abundance .
ARNT is another member of the bHLH-PAS family , and it can dimerize not only with AHR but also with yet other bHLH-PAS proteins , for instance , hypoxia-inducible factor 1 a ( HIF-1 @ ) , a protein shown to be involved in organogenesis by response to oxygen pressure in tissues .
Competition for ARNT in a cell may be another control mechanism for transcriptional regula-tion , i.e .
, ARNT is the central regulator in this protein family ( 5 , 45 ) .
Is there a physiological or pathological relevance for IL-2 induction by TCDD ?
TCDD causes thymus atrophy and immune suppression at low doses in many animal species ( 6-9 ) .
The finding that TCDD induces IL-2 production seems paradoxical , as IL-2 is an established growth and survival factor for T cells .
However , more recently , the role of IL-2 in T lymphocyte death has been discovered .
In mice genetically deficient for IL-2 , autoreactive lymphoid cells accumulated due to a failure of activation-induced cell death ( 18 , 46 , 47 ) .
Also , in FTOC , the addition of exogenous IL-2 inhibited proliferation and differentiation of T cells and diminished total cell yields ( 48-50 ) .
Interestingly , Fas ligand mRNA in CD4~CD8 * thymocytes becomes up-regulated upon TCDD exposure of FTOCs ( M.-S. Jeon , unpublished observation ) , suggesting a possible mechanism for TCDD-induced thymus atrophy .
Thus , it can not be excluded that IL-2 induction by TCDD may be causally connected to the various immunosuppressive effects of this toxic compound , although it needs further investigation .
Here we demonstrated for the first time a direct interaction between AHR and DRE in the promoter region of the IL-2 gene , which is an important gene in the immune system .
Whether TCDD-induced IL-2 expression or the induction of other genes results in immune suppression has to be investigated in further studies .
In summary , the TCDD-liganded AHR is capable of inducing transcription of IL-2 in mouse thymocytes and T cells .
The natural ligand of the AHR is not yet known .
We are tempted to speculate that the natural ligand is a player in IL-2 induction and thus important for cell homeostasis .
