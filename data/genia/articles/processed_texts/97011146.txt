Here , we report that differentiated B cells contain a novel substoichiometric TAF of 105 kDa not found associated with TFIID isolated from other cell types .
The cDNA encoding hTAF,105 reveals a highly conserved C-terminal domain shared by hTAF,130 and dTAF,110 , while the N-terminal coactivator domain has diverged significantly .
All cells tested express TAF , 105 mRNA , but only B cells contain significant levels of protein associated with TFIID .
Transient overexpression of hTAF,105 selectively squelches the transcription of some genes in B cells .
These properties suggest that TAF,105 is a cell type-specific subunit of TFIID that may be responsible for mediating transcription by a subset of activators in B cells .
Introduction The regulation of gene expression during development , differentiation , and cell growth of metazoans is thought to be directed by a large number of different sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors .
This enormous diversity of enhancer- and promoter-specific activators in turn must somehow control the activity of RNA polymerase II and its associated transcriptional machinery .
Extensive biochemical and genetic analysis carried out over the past decade reveals an elaborate cascade of protein-DNA and protein-protein transactions that collectively govern the levels of mRNA production .
One key aspect of transcriptional regulation is the communication between enhancer-bound gene-specific activators and components of the basal apparatus ( for review , see Tjian and Maniatis , 1994 ) .
Recent studies have established that the transcription factor TFIID plays a critical role in receiving transcriptional activation signals from upstream enhancer- and promoter-binding factors and transducing them to the basal initiation complex ( Horikoshi et al .
, 1988 ; Pugh and Tjian , 1990 ) .
The discovery that TFIID isolated from Drosophila and human cells consists of TATA box-binding protein ( TBP ) and eight or more tightly associated subunits ( TAFs ) provided the first clue that perhaps some TAFs could mediate transcriptional activation ( Dynlacht et al .
, 1991 ; Tanese et al .
, 1991 ) .
Recent experiments have provided evidence that , at least in vitro , the activation domains of different upstream regulators can recognize and bind selectively to specific TAF subunits of the TFIID complex ( Hoey et al .
, 1993 ; Goodrich et al .
, 1993 ; Chen et al .
, 1994 ; Jacq et al .
, 1994 ; Chiang and Roeder , 1995 ; Thut et al .
, 1995 ; Sauer et al .
, 1995 ) .
More importantly , transcription reactions reconstituted with recombinant TAFs are able to provide coactivator function and thus potentiate enhancer-dependent activation by sequence-specific regulators ( Chen et al .
, 1994 ; Thut et al .
, 1995 ; Sauer et al .
, 1995 ) .
In addition , the assembly of partial TBP-TAF complexes has suggested that specific activa-tor-TAF interactions are required to direct both simple activation as well as synergistic transcription by multiple enhancer factors ( Sauer et al .
, 1995 ) .
Finally , there is emerging evidence that at least in metazoans , TAFs are also important for mediating activation of transcription in vivo ( Sekiguchi et al .
, 1991 ; Ruppert et al .
, 1993 ; Wang and Tjian , 1994 ) .
Thus , there is a growing body of evidence that implicates TFIID as a major integrator of transcriptional activation signals .
The initial models for coactivator-mediated transcription envisioned that multiple surfaces presented by the TBP-TAF complex could provide the necessary contacts to accommodate large numbers of different activators ( Pugh and Tjian , 1990 ; Dynlacht et al .
, 1991 ; Zhou et al .
, 1992 ; Chen et al .
, 1994 ) .
Also , there was evidence that different activators of a given class ( i.e .
, glutamine-rich , acidic , etc . )
target common TAFs within TFIID ( Hoey et al .
, 1993 ; Goodrich et al .
, 1993 ; Chen et al .
, 1994 ; Thut et al .
, 1995 ; Sauer et al .
, 1995 ) .
Recently , there has been both structural and genetic evidence to suggest that rather small patches of protein surfaces may be sufficient to provide specific points of contact between components in the preinitiation complex ( Nikolov et al .
, 1995 ; Tang et al .
, 1996 ) .
It therefore seemed reasonable to hypothesize that the 8-10 TAFs in the TFIID complex might be enough to integrate most of the activator signals in the eukaryotic cell .
However , it seemed possible that in metazoans with highly elaborated tissue-specific and developmentally regulated programs of transcription , there might be a need for tissue-specific constituents of the transcription machinery , including TAFs .
The finding that yeast contain only a subset of the TAFs present in Drosophila and human TFIID ( Poon et al .
, 1995 ; Reese et al .
, 1994 ) and that certain classes of activators are unable to function in yeast ( Attardi and Tjian , 1993 ; Kunzler et al .
, 1994 ; Ponticelli et al .
, 1995 ; G. Gill and R. T. , unpublished data ) provided a hint that perhaps as organisms developed more complex gene-regulatory pathways , there was a concomitant increase in the need for more diversity of coactivators .
Indeed , several recent reports have identified mammalian cell type-specific cofactors that are required to implement activation of certain enhancer proteins ( Strubin et al .
, 1995 ; Luo and Roeder , 1995 ) .
In all cases documented thus far , these cell type-specific `` coactivators `` have been associated with activator complexes and are not part of the TFIID complex or the basal machinery .
Thus , it became of interest to determine whether metazoans have also evolved the use of cell type-specific TAFs .
Our previous studies have indicated that Drosophila and human TFIID contain at least eight core TAFs that are present in all cells tested ( R. Weinzierl , E. Wang , N. Cell 138 3° , & & & & a a & o ?

Since its appearance is not consistent ( compare with Figure 1A , lane 2 ) , we assume that it is a breakdown product .
Tanese , and R. T. , unpublished data ) , although some quantitative differences have been observed in the levels of some of the smaller subunits in fractionated HeLa TFIID complex ( Jacq et al .
, 1994 ) .
However , to date , there has been no clear evidence for cell type-specific subunits of TFIID .
A search for potential cell type-specific TAFs is likely to be complicated by the possibility that they would be present in substoichiometric amounts relative to the core subunits .
In addition , differences in the pattern of polypeptides associated with TFIID isolated from different cell types or tissues may reflect alternative splicing , proteolytic processing , and posttranslation modifications of the ubiquitous subunits rather than novel cell type-specific TAFs .
In an attempt to identify cell type-specific TAFs , we have isolated TFIID from several different cell lines by antibody affinity purification , using both anti-TBP and anti-TAF antibodies .
Of the eight cell lines we tested , only highly differentiated B cells revealed the presence of a novel large molecular mass polypeptide ( 105 kDa ) that selectively associated with TFIID .
Consistent with the notion of a cell type-specific TAF , this 105 kDa protein appears to be present in substoichiometric amounts relative to the core TAFs .
In order to characterize further this putative cell type-specific subunit , we purified the 105 kDa polypeptide from B cells to homogeneity , isolated a cDNA clone encoding this polypeptide , and compared its primary amino acid sequence with the known TAFs .
We also determined the levels of the 105 kDa protein and its corresponding mRNA in the different cell types .
Our results suggest that differentiated B cells contain a cell type-specific subunit of TFIID , TAF,105 , that is homologous to one of the core subunits , providing evidence for a family of related TAFs that includes specialized members only found associated with TFIID in certain cell types .
Interestingly , the overexpression of this putative cell type-specific TAF was able selectively to `` squelch `` the transcription of certain B cell-specific genes , but not others , in transient transfection experi-ments .
These results suggest that TAF , 105 is a cell type specific subunit of TFIID that may function as a gene-selective coactivator in certain cells .
Results TFIID Subunits in Different Human Cell Types To test the possibility that some TFIID subunits might be cell type-specific , we compared the composition of TBP-TAF complexes isolated from several human cell lines representing different tissues .
For this purpose , nuclear extracts were first fractionated by phosphocel-lulose ( PC ) chromatography to separate TFIID from other TBP-TAF complexes ( i.e .
, SL1 and TFIIB ) .
The resulting 1.0 M NaCl PC fractions were subjected to anti-ITBP affinity purification followed by SDS-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) analysis and staining with silver .
As expected , the subunit composition and levels of the core TAFs relative to TBP were very similar among the different cell types examined ( Figure 1A ) .
By contrast , the TFIID complex isolated from Daudi B cells contained an additional polypeptide of approximately 105 kDa ( Figure 1A , lane 3 ) that consistently coimmunoprecipitated with anti-T BP antibodies .
This novel polypeptide is barely detectable in TFIID isolated from non-B cells such as the neuroblastoma SK-N , glioblastoma U87 , Jurkat and Hut78 T cells , and HeLa cervical carcinoma .
Association of this 105 kDa polypeptide with the TBP-TAFs complex appears to be specific , since it can be coimmunoprecipitated with TFIID using a different TBP antibody but not by mock immunoprecipitation in the absence of TBP antibodies ( Figure 1B ) .
We confirmed that the 105 kDa polypeptide is not a breakdown product of either TAF,250 or TAF,130 by Western blot analysis , using either anti-TAF,250 or anti-TAF,130 antibodies ( data not shown ) .
Daudi cells are characterized as Epstein-Barr virus-positive ( EBV* ) differentiated IgG-producing B cells .
To determine whether the association of p105 with TBP was either EBV- or differentiation-related , we isolated Cell Type-Specific TAF 139 A_ & « & B Figure 2 .

Therefore , it is possible that this 105 kDa protein is a TAF that becomes specifically associated with TFIID in highly differentiated B cells .
TAF,105 Is a Substoichiometric Subunit of TFIID To obtain independent evidence that the TAF,105 protein was selectively associated with TFIID rather than with SL1 and TFIIIB , we used a monoclonal antibody directed against human TAF,130 to isolate TFIID complexes from either Daudi B or Jurkat T cells ( Figure 2A ) .
For these experiments , we used unfractionated nuclear extracts rather than the 1.0 M NaCl PC fraction enriched for TFIID , to exclude the possibility that TAF,105-containing complexes isolated from different cell types might merely reflect differential chromatographic properties .
Both TBP and TAF,130 antibodies coimmunoprecipitated TAF,105 together with the other `` core `` TFIID subunits from Daudi nuclear extract ( Figure 2A , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
By contrast , only TBP and the core TAFs were isolated by TAF , 130 antibody from Jurkat nuclear extracts ( Figure 2A , lane 3 ) .
To confirm these results , we also performed immunoprecipitation using the PC 1.0 M NaCl fraction from Daudi and Jurkat cell extracts .
As expected , anti-TBP selectively precipitated the TAF,105 subunit from Daudi cells but not from Jurkat cells ( Figure 2A , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
These results strongly suggest that TAF,105 may be a novel TAF subunit that is only found associated with TFIID in selected cell types , such as highly differentiated B cells .
We hypothesized that a TFIID complex containing a putative cell type-specific subunit would most likely participate in transcription of only a limited subset of genes , perhaps cell type-specific genes .
Consequently , one might expect that only a subset of TFIID complexes within the cell will contain this subunit .
Because silver-staining of proteins is notoriously nonquantitative , we have attempted to determine the relative stoichiometry of TAF , 1 05 in the B cell TFIID complex by more reliable staining methods .
Antibody affinity-purified TFIID complexes isolated from Daudi cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained by both silver and Coomassie blue ( Figure 2B ) .
Unlike the intense band of TAF,105 observed by silver staining ( left ) , the Coomassie-stained TAF,105 revealed that it is present in approximately 10-fold lower levels relative to the core TAFs and TBP ( right ) .
The apparent substoichiometric amounts of TAF,105 were further confirmed by two additional protein-staining techniques , ponceau S and Zinc staining ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that only a small fraction ( 5 % -10 % ) of the TFIID complexes within B cells contain TAF,105 .
TAF,105 Is a Homolog of Drosophila TAF , 110 and Human TAF , 130 In order to characterize further this candidate cell type-specific TAF , we set out to isolate the corresponding cDNA .
For this purpose , we purified TFIID from nuclear extracts prepared from 2000 | of Daudi cells .
TFIID was first fractionated over a PC column followed by anti-T BP affinity chromatography .
The TFIID polypeptides were resolved on a preparative SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane , and the band corresponding to hTAF,105 was excised and digested with either trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease .
The resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and subjected to microsequence analysis .
The amino acid sequence of several peptides revealed striking similarities to the conserved C-terminal region of dTAF,110 and its human homolog TAF,130 ( N. Tanese , personal commu-nication ; Figure 3 ) .
We therefore screened a Daudi cDNA library with a DNA fragment encompassing a highly conserved region of hTAF,1 30 under low stringency hybrid-ization conditions .
A pair of cDNA clones of approximately 2 kb corresponding to TAF,105 was obtained .
These cDNAs contained a 3 ' poly ( A ) tail and a portion of the coding region of TAF,105 .
To isolate the remaining portions of TAF,105 , we screened several additional human cDNA libraries with TAF , 105-specific probes .
A pair of additional clones was isolated , one of 1.6 kb and the other of 3.6 kb , which overlapped the 3 ' region .

« 0 0 0 +a Cell Type-Specific TAF 141 sequence analysis of the 3.6 kb insert revealed an open reading frame of 2406 bp that included all the peptide sequences obtained from the proteolytic digestions ( Figure 3A ) .
When this long cDNA was expressed in Sf9 cells with a flag-tag , the size of the recombinant protein was very similar to the endogenous TAF,105 ( see Figure GA ) .
Since this clone does not contain a methionine residue that is preceded by a stop codon at its most 5 ' region , we concluded that this cDNA encodes most but probably not all of TAF,105 .
We estimate that there may be 5-10 N-terminal residues missing from the full-length coding sequence .
Nevertheless , we were able to use this slightly truncated cDNA to analyze further TAF,105 regulation and biochemical properties .
Amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence of TAF,105 revealed several regions with a high degree of similarity to hTAF,130 and dTAF,110 .
In partic-ular , the C-terminal one-third of these proteins that includes domains involved in binding to other TAFs is highly conserved ( 68 % identity and 87 % homology ) .
Interestingly , additional smaller patches of identity and some more extended regions of similarity between hTAF,105 , hTAF,130 , and dTAF,110 can also be found scattered throughout the N-terminal regions ( Figure 3B ) that are thought to contain activator binding domains ( Hoey et al .
, 1993 ; J.-L. Chen and R. T. , unpublished data ) .
However , the majority of the sequences in the N-terminal region were quite diverged , suggesting that hTAF,105 has apparently evolved the potential to interact with a different subset of activators than those targeted by hTAF,130 and dTAF,110 .
The high degree of primary protein sequence identity between hTAF,105 , hTAF , 130 , and TAF , 110 provides additional and compelling evidence that the 105 kDa cell type-specific polypeptide is indeed a bona fide TAF and that these subunits may represent members of a family of related TAFs .
TAF,105 and dTAF,110 Share Conserved Interfaces for Interacting with Other TFIID Subunits Extensive analysis of the cloned TFIID subunits has indicated that formation of a stable TFIID complex involves multiple TAF-TBP and TAF-TAF interactions ( Chen et al .
, 1994 ) .
To identify the subunits in TFIID that contact TAF,105 , we performed a series of protein-protein interaction assays using immobilized flag-tagged TAF,105 and S-labeled in vitro translated TFIID subunits ( Figure 4 ) .
These experiments indicate that TAF,105 specifically interacts with hTAF,250 and dTAF,1 50 , the large subunit of TFIIA , and weakly with TBP .
In contrast , TAF,105 did not appear to interact specifically with dTAF,60 , hTAF,70 , TAF,60 , dTAF,40 , hTAF,32 ( data not shown ) , dTAF,30 « , and dTAF,308 ( Figure 4 ) .
Interestingly , a similar pattern of selective protein interactions has been observed for dTAF,110 ( Hoey et al .
, 1993 ; Weinzier| et al .
, 1993 ; Verrijzer et al .
, 1994 ; Yokomori et al .
, 19933 ) , suggesting that these closely related TAFs have conserved interaction surfaces ( i.e .
, C-terminus ) for incorporating into the TFIID complex ( J.-L. Chen , K. Yokomori , F. Sauer , D. Wasserman , and R. T. , unpublished data ) .
An exception to this pattern of TAF-TAF interaction is the ability of dTAF , 110 to bind TAF , 30 « ( Yokomori et al .
, 1993b ) .

Interactions of hTAF,105 with TFIID Subunits Human and Drosophila TAFs and TFIIA ( large subunit ) were translated in vitro by rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of `` S-methionine .
Labeled TAFs were used in interaction assays with immobilized flag-tagged TAF , 105 .
As a control , we incubated the labeled TAFs with flag beads in the absence of TAF , 105 protein .
The beads were eluted , resolved on SDS-PAGE , and autoradiographed .
The input represents 10 % of the labeled protein used for the interaction assay .
The TAFs used for the assays are indicated on top of each autoradiogram .
TAF,105 can interact with each other ( data not shown ) , raising the possibility that human TFIID complexes may incorporate both homo- and heterodimers of TAF,105 and hTAF,1 30 .
Cell Type-Specific Association of TAF,105 with TFIID Is Posttranscriptionally Regulated The finding that TAF,105 is present at high levels in TFIID complexes isolated from B cells but not from other cells tested suggests that its expression may also be cell type-specific .
To address potential mechanisms of TAF,105 regulation , we determined the levels of its mRNA in different cell types by Northern blot analysis with a TAF , 105-specific probe .
As a control , we hybridized identical samples with the ubiquitous hTAF,130 probe ( Figure 5A ) .
Our analysis of TAF , 105 RNA revealed a single transcript of about 4.6 kb that is expressed at relatively invariant levels in all the cell types examined .
To confirm this finding further , we performed RNase protection assays .
Similar amounts of RNA extracted from different cell types were hybridized with hTAF,105-or hTAF,250-specific probes followed by digestion with RNase A and RNase T1 .
Here again , the levels of protected TAF,105 transcripts from different cell types appeared comparable .
Taken together , these data suggest that the regulation of TAF,105 may be posttranscrip-tional , raising the possibility that the levels of TAF,105 protein may be regulated in a cell type-specific manner .
As a first step towards quantitating the amounts of TAF,105 protein in different cells , we expressed the less Cell 142 A .

conserved N-terminal portion of the protein in Escherichia coli and raised polyclonal antibodies against this region of TAF,105 .
These anti-TAF,105 antibodies specifically recognized a 105 kDa polypeptide present in Daudi nuclear extract as well as recombinant TAF,105 produced in Sf9 cells ( Figure 6A ) .
As expected , anti-TAF,105 antibodies can also immunoprecipitate TAF,105 together with all the core TFIID subunits , including its homolog TAF,130 , from Daudi extracts ( Figure 6B ) , indicating that both TAF,105 and TAF,130 might be present in the same complex .
To measure the relative levels of TAF,105 protein expressed in different cell types , similar amounts of nuclear extracts from different cell types were subjected to Western blot analysis using TAF,105 and TBP antibodies .
As shown in Figures 6C and 6D , the levels of TAF,105 protein were 10-20-fold higher in Daudi B cells than in non-B cells , suggesting that the cell type-specific regulation of TAF,105 may be at the level of protein expression .
The anti-TAF,105 antibodies were also used to compare the levels of TAF,105 associated with affinity-purified TFIID isolated from Daudi , Jurkat , and SK-N cells ( Figure 6E ) .
These antibodies specifically detected TAF,105 in Daudi TFIID but not in Jurkat and SK-N TFIID complex .
We verified the fact that the level of TBP in the TFIID complex was similar by Western blotting with TBP antibodies ( data not shown ) .
Next , we looked at TAF,105 protein levels in another differentiated human B cell line , BJAB , and in normal human tissue extracts such as B lymphocytes , liver , colon , and brain by Western blotting ( Figures GF and 6G ) .
As expected , TAF,105 was easily detected in BJAB and normal B lymphocytes but not in HeLa and the other normal tissues .
Taken together , these results add support to the notion that TAF,105 is cell type specific and suggest that the production of TAF,105 protein is cell type-specifically regulated .
Differential Effect of TAF,105 Overexpression on Selected Promoters in B Cells At present , cell type-specific activators that require TAF,105 have not been identified .
Thus , itis not practical or possible to test directly the potential cell type-specific coactivator properties of TAF,105 .
However , it is possible to determine whether TAF , 105 has any effect on the transcription of selected genes in B cells by relying on the phenomenon of `` squelching `` ( Gill and Ptashne , 1988 ; Berger et al .

In our case , the overexpression of a coactivator rather than an activator should inhibit the transcription of specific genes that require the coactivator .
To test whether TAF,105 has any transcriptional function and is able to squelch transcription in B cells , wedetermined the effect of overexpressing TAF,105 on several promoters that are expressed in B cells .
Reporter gene constructs driven by the Kappa chain promoter linked either to the intronic enhancer ( kEKPLuc ) or to the 3 ' enhancer ( EK3'kPLuc ) were cotransfected along with hTAF,105 expression vectors into BJAB cells .
In addition , we also tested a reporter containing the J chain enhancer/promoter as well as a control template carrying the cyto-megalovirus ( CMV ) promoter .
Each of these reporter constructs was cotransfected with increasing amounts of expression plasmids bearing TAF,105 .
Overexpression of TAF,105 in BJAB cells efficiently inhibited transcription from both of the Kappa enhancer/promoter constructs ( 3-5-fold ; Figure 7 ) .
By contrast , the expression of TAF,105 had no significant effect on J chain promoter/enhancer transcription nor on the CMV promoter activity in these same cells .
As might be expected of a typical squelching reaction , a truncated version of TAF,105 lacking the C-terminal TAF-TAF interaction domain but containing the putative activator interaction domain was also able to inhibit transcription from the Kappa promoter/enhancer constructs ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that TAF,105 most likely functions as a coactivator or target for a subset of activators responsible for transcription of genes in B cells .
Discussion It has been well established that combinatorial arrays of gene-specific DNA binding factors ( i.e .
, activators , repressors , and associated cofactors ) govern the principal means by which cell type-specific gene expression is regulated in animal cells .
In this study we present evidence that the basal transcriptional apparatus may also incorporate cell type-specific components and thereby provide additional mechanisms for directing tissue-specific transcription .
We have identified , purified , cloned , and partially characterized a novel 105 kDa human TAF that is found in TFIID isolated from differentiated B cells but essentially undetectable in TBP-TAF complexes purified from a variety of other cell types representing different tissues .

can be mediated by subsets of TBP-TAF complexes and that coactivator function most likely involves direct interactions between TAFs and activation domains of transcription factors ( Chen et al .
, 1994 ; Jacq et al .
, 1994 ; Chiang and Roeder , 1995 ; Thut et al .
, 1995 ; Sauer et al .
, 1995 ) .
For example , glutamine-rich activation domains of human SP1 and Drosophila bicoid were shown to contact directly human TAF , 130 or its Drosophila homolog dTAF,110 to direct transcriptional activation in vitro ( Chen et al .
, 1994 ; Sauer et al .
, 1995 ; N. Tanese , personal communication ) .
Here we report that human TAF,105 is highly related to these two core TAFs , hTAF,130 and dTAF,110 , suggesting that these three subunits of TFIID represent different members of a family of TAFs that can serve as transcriptional coactivators .
Although many of the TAFs first identified in Drosophila and human TFIID have recently also been found in yeast , thus farno homolog of dTAF,110 or hTAF,130 has been isolated from yeast ( Poon et al .
, 1995 ; Reese et al .
, 1994 ) .
As one might expect , activators such as human SP1 and Drosophila bicoid that use a glutamine-rich domain to target the TAF,130/110 family of coactivators are unable to function in yeast via the glutamine-rich activation domains ( Attardi and Tjian , 1993 ; Kunzler et al .
, 1994 ; Ponticelli et al .
, 1995 ; G. Gill and R. T. , unpublished data ) .
It is possible that this class of TAFs that includes the cell type-specific TAF,105 evolved to accommodate the more elaborated needs of transcriptional regulation in metazoans .
The primary amino acid sequence of hTAF,105 and related members of this family of TAFs ( TAF,130 and dTAF,110 ) reveal the presence of two distinct domains : a highly conserved C-terminal region and an N-terminal domain containing significantly more diverged sequences interspersed with small patches of homology .
Recent experiments with dTAF,110 mutants suggest that the conserved C-terminal region is responsible for interacting with TAF,250 and TFIIA ( F. Sauer , D. Wasserman , and R. T. , unpublished data ) , whereas the less conserved N-terminal domain of TAF , 110 contains interaction surfaces that bind to activators ( Hoey et al .
, 1993 ) .
Since many of the contacts between hTAF,105 and Cell 144 200 Figure 7 .

Therefore , in differentiated B cells one might expect to find TFIID complexes that contain either TAF , ,1 05 or TAF,1 30 but perhaps not both .
However , when we isolated TFIID complexes using either anti-TAF,105 or anti-TAF,130 antibodies from B cells , we found both polypeptides in the same complex .
It is possible that in these TFIID complexes , each of the related TAFs uses a different portion of its potential interaction surfaces to assemble into TFIID .
An alternative explanation was provided by the finding that TAF,105 and TAF,110 could interact directly with each other ( R. D. and R. T. , unpublished data ) , suggesting that TFIID from B cells may contain either homodimers of human TAF,130 or heterodimers of human TAF,105 and 130 .
It is also possible that TFIID can exist as dimers ( Coleman et al .
, 1995 ; Taggart and Pugh , 1996 ) and that therefore , TFIID complexes containing both TAF,105 and TAF,130 would be coprecipitated .
By analogy to the functional domains of dTAF,110 and hTAF , 130 , the N-terminal region of human TAF,105 is predicted to interact with activation domains .
We anticipate that a TFIID complex containing TAF,105 will play some role in the transcription of cell type-specific genes , perhaps by directly contacting a subset of B cell enhancer-binding proteins to mediate transcription .
It will be of interest in the future to identify putative cell type-specific activators that will require the presence of TAF,105 to potentiate transcriptional activation .
In this respect , it is reassuring that overexpression either of full-length TAF,105 or of a truncated version containing the putative activator interaction domain ( N-ter-minal region ) is able to squelch differentially transcription of selected genes in B cells .
It is likely that the nonconserved N-terminal sequences of TAF,105 have evolved to direct interactions with certain activators that are not targeted by human TAF,130 , possibly cell type-specific activators .
However , we also expect to find activators that can interact with both TAF , 105 and TAF,130 , since there are regions of the putative N-terminal coactivator domain that are conserved between members of this family of TAFs .
In addition , the conserved C-terminal domain may also contain coactivator functions that could be targeted by common activators .
Human TFIID isolated from B cells contain substoichiometric amounts of TAF,105 , suggesting that only a small proportion of the TBP-TAF complexes in these cells contain this tissue-specific subunit .
This finding is consistent with the notion that only a limited number of genes , perhaps cell type-specific genes , are targeted by TFIID complexes containing TAF , 105 .
Consequently , only a limited set of genes that are expressed in B cells are expected to recruit TFIID complexes containing TAF,105 .
It is also possible that TAF,105-containing TFIID complexes will display other biochemical properties distinct from core TFIID , such as an altered DNA binding specificity that is influenced by the presence of TAF,105 .
Once cell type-specific enhancers and activators that require human TAF , 105 are identified , it should be possible to address these important issues .
Although we screened for putative cell type-specific TAFs in TFIID complexes isolated from several different cell types , we have thus far failed to identify any additional cell type-specific subunits other than TAF,105 .
Our ability to detect TAF,105 initially was , in part , aided by the fortuitous property of this protein to stain efficiently with silver .
We do not believe that TAF,105 will be the only substoichiometric cell type-specific subunit associated with TFIID .
Instead , we anticipate that a more systematic screen will reveal the presence of additional Cell Type-Specific TAF 145 cell type-specific components of the TFIID complex .
To detect additional cell type-specific and potentially developmentally regulated TAFs , it will be necessary to devise more sensitive detection methods , especially if these proteins are substoichiometric and of small molecular mass .
Interestingly , analysis of messenger RNA and protein in different cell types suggests that TAF,105 may be posttranscriptionally regulated in a cell type-specific manner .
Using specific anti-TAF,105 antibodies , we found significantly higher levels of TAF,1 05 protein in B cell extracts relative to non-B cells , whereas the levels of TAF,1 05 mRNA were comparable .
Moreover , the difference in the levels of TAF,105 protein associated with TFIID in B cells versus non-B cells was even greater than the relative amounts of total TAF,105 protein , suggesting that both the protein levels and the association of TAF,105 with TFIID may be regulated .
It is possible that either the protein expression or the stability of 105 in non-B cells is regulated .
For example , the differential ability of TAF,105 to associate with TFIID might be directed by cell type-specific covalent modifications .
The low levels of free TAF,105 protein in non-B cells may result in part from its inability to be stably incorporated into TFIID ; thus , the free polypeptides become rapidly degraded .
In B cells in which TAF,105 is tightly bound to the other subunits of TFIID , proteolytic degradation is likely to be mitigated .
Future studies of TAF,1 05 in B cells and non-B cells may reveal the mechanisms that regulate association and assembling of cell type-specific TFIID complexes .
Experimental Procedures Antibodies and Immunoprecipitations Nuclear extracts from different cell types were prepared and fractionated by PC P11 column as described ( Pugh and Tjian , 1990 ; Tanese et al .
, 1991 ) .
Polyclonal anti-TBP antibodies raised against recombinant hTBP were described ( Tanese et al .
, 1991 ) .
The antibodies were affinity-purified using TBP-coupled affinity resins .
Monoclonal anti-TAF,130 antibody IAS was described ( Ruppert et al .
, 1993 ) .
TAF,105 polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 1-552 produced in bacteria with 6 histidine-tag .
The inclusion bodies containing over-expressed TAF,105 were dissolved in 6 M urea , purified by Nit agarose resin , and resolved on SDS-PAGE , and TAF,105 protein was excised and injected into rabbits .
Immunoprecipitations of TFIID complex by affinity-purified TBP antibodies , 130 { IA5 ) , and anti-TAF,105 were carried with TFIID-enriched PC fractions or directly from nuclear extracts essentially as described ( Tanese et al .
, 1991 ) .
Briefly , 400 ug of 1.0 M NaCl PC fraction or 5 mg of nuclear extracts in HEMG buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ ph 7.9 ] , 100 mM KCI , 12.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.1 % NP-40 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) were incubated with antibodies and protein A sepharose beads at 4°C for 2-3 hr .
The immune complexes were washed with HEMG buffer five times and eluted either by 1 M guanidine-HCI followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation or by 5 min boiling in SDS-PAGE protein sample buffer .
For the Western blot analysis shown in Figure 6G , premade extracts from normal human liver , colon , and brain were purchased from Clontech , and enriched B lymphocytes extract was a gift from Dr. T. Hoey ( Tularik Inc. ) .
Cloning of TAF,105 cDNA Daudi cells nuclear extracts were prepared from 2000 | of culture , and TFIID-enriched fraction was obtained by PC column ( Tanese et al .
, 1991 ) .
TFIID was immunopurified directly from PC 1.0 M NaCl fraction using cross-linked anti-T BP resin , and the TAFs were eluted by 50 mM glycine ( pH 2.5 ) and 150 mM NaCl and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid containing deoxycholate ( 4 mg/ml } .
The TAFs were resolved by SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose membrane , and stained with ponceau $ ( Sigma ) .
The band corresponding to TAF,105 was excised and digested with either trypsin or V8 prote-ases , and peptides eluted from the membrane were resolved by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and subjected to microsequencing .
The amino acid sequence of the peptides obtained are shown in Figure 3A .
DaudicDNA library ( 1.5 X 10° phages ) was screened with 237 bp probe derived from hTAF,130 { amino acids 808-887 ) generated by polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides 5'AAA/G TTT/C TTT/C GAA/G CAA/G T/C T 3 ' and 5'CCNGGA/G CAA/G TCNACT/C TT 3 ' .
A set of two TAF,105 positive phages was isolated , and their 1.9 and 2 kb inserts were cloned into Bluescript KS* ( Stratagene ) , sequenced , and found to contain 1 kb of 3 ' untranslated region and 1 kb of coding region containing the sequence of seven peptides obtained by the proteolytic diges-tion .
To clone the N-terminus of TAF , ,105 , we screened the following human cDNA libraries : human teratocarcinoma , Jurkat , HeLa , and another Daudi cDNA library .
A set of two positive clones was obtained from the HeLa cell library , one of 1.6 kb overlapping with the clones isolated from the Daudi library and a second clone of 3.6 kb insert .
This insert was cloned in Bluescript KS* , and both strands of this cDNA were completely sequenced with Bluescript or TAF , 105-specific primers .
RNA Analysis Total cytoplasmic RNA samples were prepared from cultured cells according to the procedure that has been described ( Gough , 1988 ) .
For Northern blot analysis , 30 pg of RNA prepared from different cell types was electrophoresed on a 1 % formaldehyde/agarose gel in duplicates .
RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and hybridized with riboprobes complementary to either hTAF,105 or hTAF , 130 .
For RNase protection assay , 30 ug of total RNA extracted from different cell types were hybridized with anti-sense RNA probes corresponding to hTAF , ,105 or hTAF,250 for 16 hr at 55°C in 40 mM PIPES ( pH 6.7 ) , 350 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 80 % formamide .
RNase A ( 40 g/m ! )
and RNase T1 ( 2 g/m ! )
were added , and digestion was carried out at 30°C for 30 min .
The reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 g of proteinase K and 10 l of SDS and incubation at 37°C for 30 min .
After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation , the samples were resolved on 6 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed .

fragment containing the coding region was subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVLSG2Flag in Nde !
site .
Recombinant baculovirus was generated as described ( Dikstein et al .
, 1996 ) .
Crude extracts from cells expressing flag-TAF,105 were bound to flag antibody beads ( Kodak ) in 0.5 M KCI HEMG buffer for 2-3 hr .
After five washes with the same buffer , a small portion was analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Before the interaction assays , the beads were washed twice with 0.1 M KCI HEMG .
In Vitro Binding Experiments S-labeled TAFs were synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase and rabbit reticulocytes lysate and incubated with flag beads or with TAF,105 coupled to flag beads in 0.1 M KCI HEMG buffer for 2 hr at 4°C .
The beads were washed five times with the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted by 5 min boiling in protein sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography .
Plasmids and Transfection kEKPLuc and EK3'kPLuc were generated by replacing a BamHI fragment containing the CAT gene and SV40 poly A signal of kEKPCAT { Atchison and Perry , 1987 ) and EK3'kPCAT ( a gift from Dr. M. Atchi-son ) with a BamHI-Bglll fragment containing the luciferase gene and SV40 pA signal from pGL2 basic vector ( Promega ) .
