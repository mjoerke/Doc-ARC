KWOK* Department of Medicine `` and Department of Laboratory Medicine , `` University of Washington , Seattle , Washington 98105 ; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , Washington 98104 `` ; and Virginia Mason Research Center , Seattle , Washington 98101° Received 16 March 1998/Accepted 19 May 1998 The local cellular immune response to herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is important in the control of recurrent HSV infection .
The antiviral functions of infiltrating CD4-bearing T cells may include cytotoxicity , inhibition of viral growth , lymphokine secretion , and support of humoral and CD8 responses .
The antigens recognized by many HSV-specific CD4 T cells localizing to genital HSV-2 lesions are unknown .
T cells recognizing antigens encoded within map units 0.67 to 0.73 of HSV DNA are frequently recovered from herpetic lesions .
Expression cloning with this region of DNA now shows that tegument protein VP22 and the viral dUTPase , encoded by genes U , 49 and U , 50 , respectively , are T-cell antigens .
Separate epitopes in VP22 were defined for T-cell clones from each of three patients .
Reactivity with the tegument protein encoded by U , 21 was identified for an additional patient .
Three new epitopes were identified in VP16 , a tegument protein associated with VP22 .
Some tegument-specific CD4 T-cell clones exhibited cytotoxic activity against HSV-infected cells .
These results suggest that herpes simplex tegument proteins are processed for antigen presentation in vivo and are possible candidate compounds for herpes simplex vaccines .
Cellular immune responses are required to limit the severity of recurrent herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infections in humans ( 38 ) .
HSV -specific CD4 and CD8 T cells infiltrate herpetic lesions ( 16 , 17 , 19 ) .
In vitro , some HSV -specific CD4 T cells are cytotoxic toward virus-infected cells ( 41 , 42 ) .
HSV-specific CD4 T cells make large amounts of gamma interferon ( 7 ) , which may overcome HSV-mediated HLA class I downregu-lation and permit lysis of HSV-infected cells by CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) ( 35 ) .
Gamma interferon also upregu-lates HLA class II on HSV-infected keratinocytes to allow recognition by cytolytic CD4 T cells ( 26 ) and has direct antiviral effects ( 13 ) .
The antigenic specificity of HSV-specific CD4 T cells in infected humans is incompletely defined .
CD4 T-cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) to HSV envelope glycoproteins B , C , D , and H have been detected by bulk culture , limiting dilution , or clonal analyses ( 22 , 26 , 36 , 44 ) .
PBMC-derived CD4 T-cell clones ( TCC ) commonly recognize envelope glycoproteins ( 43 , 44 ) , and bulk cultures of PBMC-derived HSV -specific CD4 CTL efficiently recognize glycopro-tein-expressing target cells ( 26 ) .
However , we determined that only a minority of lesion-infiltrating CD4 TCC recognize glycoprotein B , C , or D ( 17 ) , and bulk cultures of lesion-infiltrating T cells show reactivity with glycoprotein B or D for only 50 to 70 % of donors ( 19 ) .
We therefore undertook studies to define additional HSV T-cell antigens .
The region near 0.7 map units on the HSV type 2 ( HSV-2 ) genome was identified as rich in HSV-2 type-specific T-cell antigens ( 17 ) .
The unique long ( U ; ) 48 gene , encoding tegument protein VP16 , contains at least three T-cell epitopes ( 14 ) but does not account for all the antigenicity in this region ( 17 ) .

7476 initially identified VP22 ( encoded by U ; , 49 ) and dUTPase ( encoded by U ; 50 ) as T-cell antigens .
Expression cloning with full-length viral DNA independently showed recognition of VP22 by a lesion-derived TCC from a second donor , and local VP22-specific responses were also detected for a third donor at bulk and clonal levels .
Three separate epitopes were identified in VP22 .
Reactivity with an additional tegument protein , U , 21 , was also detected .
VP22 is tightly associated with VP16 in the virion tegument as well as within infected cells ( 10 ) .
We therefore extended our previous studies with VP16 and identified three additional epitopes recognized by lesion-infiltrating T cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Viruses and cells .
HSV-1 strain E115 ( 34 ) , HSV-2 strain 333 ( 15 ) , and intertypic recombinant viruses ( IRV ) RS1G31 ( 29 ) , DX32 ( 31 ) , and RP-2 ( 17 ) were grown and titered in Vero cells ( 20 ) .
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lympho-blastoid cell lines ( EBV-LCL ) included both autologous cell lines created from donors with genital herpes as previously described ( 20 ) and the characterized lines AMAI ( homozygous for HLA DPB1*0402 ) , HOM2 ( homozygous for HLA DQB1*0501 ) , MAT ( homozygous for HLA DQB1*0201 ) , and ARENT ( homozygous for HLA DPB1*2001 ) ( 4 ) .
HSV-specific T cells were obtained after approval by the Institutional Review Board .
Most clones were derived without secondary in vitro stimulation with antigen .
Donors 1 through 4 are numbered as previously described ( 17 ) , and donors 1 , 2 , and 4 were the sources of lesion-derived clones 1.L3D5.10.8 , 2.3 , and 4.2E1 , respectively ; clones 2.3 and 4.2E1 have been described previously ( 17 ) .
Additional lesion-derived clones came from donor 5 , from whose second , third , and fourth lesion samples ( each separated by 1 year ) clones ESL2.20 , ESL3.334 , ESLA4.34 , and ESLA.9 were derived .
Other clones , such as RH.13 and KM.7 , were derived from donors 6 and 7 .
Clones 2.3 , 4.2E1 , ESL2.20 , RH.13 , and KM.17 were derived directly from herpetic vesicle fluid ( 16 ) .
To derive CD4 TCC ESLA.9 , biopsy of a recurrent genital HSV-2 lesion ( day 3 of symptoms ) was performed and bulk lesion-infiltrating cells were expanded with phytohemagglu-tinin and interleukin 2 ( Schiaperelli Biosystems , Columbia , Md . )
in the presence of acyclovir as described elsewhere ( 19 ) .
After 16 days , cells were cloned at 1 cell/well ( 16 ) .
Previously described VP16-specific clones 1A.B.25 , ESL3.334 , and ESLA4.34 ( 8 , 14 , 18 ) were similarly derived from bulk cultures .
Some clones were derived by using secondary in vitro stimulation with antigen .
To derive additional TCC from donor 1 ( 17 ) , phytohemagglutinin-driven bulk cultures were prepared from each of four 2-mm biopsy specimens ( day 5 of symptoms ) obtained 6 years after the occurrence of the lesion from which clone voL .
72 , 1998 1A.B.25 ( mentioned above ) was derived .
After 16 days , 1.5 X 10° bulk lymphocytes from one biopsy culture were stimulated with 10 pg of HSV-2 VP22 , amino acids 105 to 190 ( VP22 105-190 ) /ml ( see below ) and an equal number of autologous irradiated ( 3,300 rads ) PBMC in 2 ml of T-cell medium ( 16 ) .
Interleukin 2 ( 32 U/ml ) was added starting on day 6 .
TCC 1.L3D5.10.8 was isolated from this line on day 12 as described elsewhere ( 16 ) .
To create PBMC-derived TCC and BM.17 , 1.5 x 10° PBMC of HSV-2-seropositive donors 8 and 9 were stimulated for 12 days with 4 ug of baculovirus-derived full-length VP16/ml in 24-well plates ; responding cells were cloned at 1 cell/well .
TCC and lines were used 10 to 14 days after the last stimulation .
All cell lines were negative for mycoplasmas except ARENT .
ARENT was initially positive for mycoplasmas by DNA probe test ( Genprobe , San Diego , Calif. ) and was treated with ciprofloxacin at 10 ug/ml ( 12 ) for 2 weeks prior to utilization , with conversion of the test to negative .
Flow cytometry .
Flow cytometry used a combination of murine monoclonal antibodies ( MAb ) to human CD4 ( clone SFCI 12T4D11 ) and CD8 ( clone SFCI 21Thy2D3 , recognizing the a chain of human CD8 ) ( Coulter , Hialeah , Fla. ) .
Immunoblotting .
Lysates of HSV-infected Vero cells were prepared , electro-phoresed through sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -10 % polyacrylamide gels , and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described elsewhere ( 1 ) .
Blots were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) -0.05 % Tween 20-1 % nonfat dried milk .
Antigen was detected by sequential incubation with a 1:100 dilution of MAb P43 , specific for the U ; 49 gene product , VP22 ( 11 ) , affinity-purified goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin M-peroxidase conjugate ( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo . )
, and the TMB substrate system ( Kirkegaard and Perry , Gaithersburg , Md . )
with three washes ( 5 min each ) in PBS-Tween between each step .
Viral DNA libraries and cloning .
For subgenomic DNA , the HSV-2 strain HG-52 BamHI w fragment was subcloned from the Bg/II i fragment and gel purified .
Viral DNA was digested with SmaI , BamHI ends were blunted with Klenow DNA polymerase , and DNA fragments were purified by phenol extraction and alcohol precipitation .
For whole-virus DNA , confluent Vero cells were infected with HSV-2 strain HGS52 .
Total nucleic acids from three 150-cm > cell cultures were prepared by proteinase K digestion , chloroform-phenol extraction , and isopropanol precipitation .
The resultant material was treated with RNAse H and was reextracted and precipitated .
Aliquots ( 1 pg ) of HGS2 DNA were digested with Smal or Alul , and 80 % of these digests were combined and recovered as described above for creation of expression libraries .
Expression cloning used pUEX vectors ( 5 ) .
pUEX1 , -2 , and -3 DNAs were linearized with SmaI , dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase , and gel purified .
Approximately 100 ng of vector and 500 ng of DNA fragments were ligated , and 10 % of ethanol-precipitated reaction mixtures were used to transform Escherichia coli DH1O0 Electromax ( GIBCO ) by electroporation ( BTX , San Diego , Calif. ) in 1-mm cuvettes .
After 1 h of recovery in 1 ml of SOC medium , portions were frozen as glycerol stocks ( 100 pl each ) , titered on ampicillin plates at 30°C ( 250 p1 ) , or used directly ( 250 wl ) for protein induction to create fusion protein libraries .
Several thousand ampicillin-resistant colonies were isolated per transformation .
To amplify genomic libraries , glycerol stocks were grown overnight at 30°C in 2 % YT-ampicillin medium and refrozen .
Confirmatory subcloning of VP22 105-190 , U ; , 50 118-312 , and U ; 50 118-250 was performed by isolating the 262-bp Smal-Sful fragment of U ; 49 , the 583-bp Smal fragment of U , 50 , and the 397-bp Smal-Stul fragment of Uj 50 , respec-tively .
Fragments were cloned into the appropriate linearized , gel-purified pUEX vector , and protein was expressed in £ .
coli DHSa .
Constructs were confirmed by sequencing .
Antigens .
Whole-virus preparations containing 10° to 10° PFU/ml were UV inactivated for 30 min ( 16 ) and used at a 1:100 final dilution .
Peptides of VP22 were synthesized as described elsewhere ( 18 ) and used as stocks at 2 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide .
Peptides of U ; 48 , 13 amino acids long and overlapping by 4 amino acids , and VP16 of HSV-2 , amino acids 1 to 416 , and full-length VP16 , both expressed in baculovirus , were a kind gift of Rac L. Burke and Michael Tigges , Chiron Corporation , Emeryville , Calif. Bacterium-derived protein antigen expression was induced for 2 h at 42°C in cells growing logarithmically ( optical density at 600 nm , 0.4 to 0.6 ) in 2 % YT-ampicillin broth at 30°C .
Protein was purified as described elsewhere ( 27 ) , omitting gel purification .
Bacterial cultures of 50 ml ( libraries ) or 5- to 10-ml cultures ( pools and clones ) yielded fine particulate suspensions in 200 to 400 ul of PBS ( Ca and Mg free ) .
Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IIl . )
after proteins were solubilized in 1 % SDS at 60°C for 10 min .
In some experiments , heat-induced bacteria were washed with PBS and PBS-10 mM EDTA , heated to 56°C for 10 min , and washed in PBS prior to use as antigens .
After identification of an active library of viral DNA , antigen identification used 30 to 60 clones for subgenomic viral DNA fragments or 2,000 to 3,000 clones for full-length viral DNA .
For the less complex library , 1-ml cultures of each clone were processed as pools of six to eight clones .
Individual clones within the active pool , and confirmatory subclones containing known viral DNA frag-ments , were processed as 5-ml cultures .
A combinatorial method ( 27 ) was used to screen libraries from whole-virus DNA .
Glycerol stocks of amplified libraries of transformed bacteria were titered on ampicillin plates ; 20 to 30 colonies/well were cultured overnight at 30°C in a 96-well plate in a rotating shaker .
Cultures were diluted 1:100 into 1-ml cultures , and fusion protein synthesis was induced as described above .
Portions ( 400 wl ) of cultures were pooled row- and colum- CD4 T CELLS SPECIFIC FOR HSV-2 TEGUMENT PROTEINS - 7477 nwise for protein purification and evaluation in lymphoproliferation assays .
If more than one row and column were positive , wells at the intersections of positive rows and one positive column were used to prepare protein from 5- to 10-ml cultures to definitively identify a positive well .
Cultures ( n = 96 colonies ) of bacteria were derived from ampicillin plates seeded with diluted broth from positive wells .
These were evaluated as pools ( of 12 bacterial colonies ) and then individual clones .
Lymphocyte functional assays .
Triplicate proliferation assay wells contained 10+ cloned T cells , 10° irradiated ( 3,300 rads ) PBMC , or 2.5 X 10 irradiated ( 8,000 rads ) EBV-LCL as antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) and antigen in 200 pl of T-cell medium ( 18 ) in 96-well U-bottom plates .
When heat-killed bacteria were used as the antigen , the equivalent of 10° CFU/well ( prior to inactivation ) was added and gentamicin ( 20 pg/ml ) was included .
After 72 h , 1 Ci of [ °H ] thy-midine/well was added for 18 h , cells were harvested , and incorporation of thymidine was evaluated by liquid scintillation counting .
Standard deviations were less than 10 % of the mean values .
Results are reported as mean counts per minute or as change in counts per minute ( Acpm ) , equal to mean counts per minute for the experimental antigen minus mean counts per minute for the control antigen .
The control antigen was mock-infected cell lysate for whole-virus antigens and pUEX2-derived B-galactosidase for recombinant protein preparations .
To determine the reactivity of bulk-cultured lesion-derived T cells , fusion proteins or control B-galactosidase was used at 10 pg/ml .
Glycoproteins B and D and VP16 of HSV-2 were used at 1 ug/ml , and assays were performed as described previously ( 19 ) .
To determine HLA-restricting loci , HLA-DR-specific MAb L243 ( 32 ) , HLA-DP-specific MAb B7.21 ( 37 ) , or HLA-DQ-specific MAb SPV-L3 ( 33 ) was used as described previously ( 17 ) .
Cytolysis assays were performed in triplicate by using 4-h `` Cr release as described elsewhere ( 20 ) .
Target EBV-LCL were infected for 18 h with HSV-2 at a multiplicity of infection of 30 or pulsed with 1.0 M peptide for 90 min prior to washing as described elsewhere ( 21 ) .
The effector-to-target ratio was 20:1 .
Spontancous release was less than 28 % .
DNA sequencing .
Viral inserts in plasmids in bacteria yielding active proteins were completely sequenced ( Taq DyeDeoxy FS kit ; Perkin-Elmer ABI , Foster City , Calif. ) in both directions by starting with primers CATGGCTGAATATC GACGGT ( 5 ' end of insert ) and CTAGAGCCGGATCGATCCGGTC ( 3 ' end of insert ) and then using internal primers designed as required .
HLA typing .
HLA-DR and -DQ typing was performed at class II alleles by serologic methods or at the DNA level by reverse dot blot hybridization ( 25 ) .
HLA-DP typing was performed by sequencing ( HLA-DP kit ; Perkin-Elmer ABI ) .
RESULTS Fine localization of T-cell epitopes .
To reduce the complexity of libraries for expression cloning , we selected a TCC-rec-ognizing antigen ( s ) partially mapped by using HSV-1 X HSV-2 IRV .
We have previously determined that HSV DNA near 0.7 map units encodes T-cell antigens in addition to VP16 .
Epitope mapping for TCC 4.2E1 and 2.3 ( 17 ) was improved with IRV DX32 ( Fig .
1 ) .
This HSV-2-based virus contains a block of HSV-1 DNA near 0.7 map units ( 31 ) .
The U , 48 gene product has the HSV-2 phenotype , as shown by reactivity with the HSV-2 type-specific , VP16-specific ( 17 ) TCC 1A.B.25 .
The U ; , 49 ( Fig .
2 ) and U , 50 gene products ( 39 , 40 ) also have an HSV-2 phenotype .
The HSV-2 DNA present in IRV DX32 therefore includes U ; 48 , U , 49 , U ; 50 , and most likely the intervening U ; , 49.5 .
Since TCC 4.2E1 and 2.3 react with RS1G31 and DX32 , but not with RP2 ( Fig .
1 ) , recognition of U , 49 , U , 49.5 , or U ; 50 is most likely .
Expression cloning to determine T-cell antigens .
The BamHI w fragment of HSV-2 was selected for expression cloning , since it contains the U ; 49 and U , 49.5 coding sequences and most of the U ; 50 coding sequence ( 6 , 11 , 24 ) .
Seventy to ninety percent of random colonies contained an insert ; all were of viral origin .
The most active libraries ( Table 1 ) for each TCC ( pUEX1 for TCC 4.2E1 and pUEX3 for TCC 2.3 ) were se-lected , and an individual reactive bacterial clone was detected by sequential testing of pools and individual colonies ( Table 2 ) .
Clone 1.1.3 encodes a fusion protein eliciting proliferation by TCC 4.2E1 .
This clone contains a backwards 80-bp Smal fragment of U ; 49 , a 262-bp Smal fragment of HSV-2 U , 49 DNA predicted to encode amino acids 105 to 190 , forward and in frame with regard to B-galactosidase , and a 246-bp Smal fragment of U ; 49 forward but out of frame due to a deletion of a 7478 KOELLE ET AL .

Clone 3.19 contained a 583-bp Smal fragment encoding amino acids 118 to 312 of U , 50 , followed by backwards 80- and 96-bp SmaI fragments of U , 49 .
Identification of T-cell antigens was confirmed by targeted subcloning and overlapping peptides .
The 262-bp SmaI fragment of U ; , 49 of HSV-2 encoding amino acids 105 to 190 was subcloned into pUEX3 to yield plasmid 49.262.12 .
This protein stimulated TCC 4.2E1 ( Table 2 ) .
Only peptide 105-126 of VP22 of HSV-2 ( GGPVGAGGRSHAPPARTPKMTR ) was stimulatory ( Fig .
3 ) .
DNA fragments encoding U , 50 118-312 and 118-250 were subcloned into pUEX3 .
Fusion proteins expressing these fragments were active ( Table 2 ) .
Evaluation of random colonies from full-length HSV-2 DNA libraries showed that 80 to 100 % contained plasmids with an insert ; 80 to 100 % of inserts were of viral origin .
For both TCC ESLA.9 and ESL2.20 , only the pUEX3 protein library elicited lymphoproliferation ( Table 1 ) .
Since the libraries were more complex than those made from the BamHI w fragment , 2,000 to 3,000 bacterial transformants were screened by a combinatorial method .
In preliminary experiments , heat-killed , washed bacteria were found to substitute for inclusion body preparations of protein in lymphoproliferation assays at the pool ( 5 to 12 bacterial clones ) and final-assay stages ( data not shown ) .
Sequencing of plasmids in positive bacteria showed that TCC ESLA.9 recognized a 44-amino-acid fragment of U , 49 gene product VP22 ( amino acids 177 to 220 ) , while TCC ESL2.20 recognized a 34-amino-acid fragment of the U , 21 gene prod uct ( amino acids 148 to 181 ) ( Table 2 ) .
In both cases , single Alul fragments of HSV-2 DNA were inserted in frame and forward .
Peptide mapping revealed that amino acids 187 to 206 ( Fig .

Fusion proteins as probes of bulk lesion-infiltrating T cells .
Newly discovered T-cell antigens were added to the panel of HSV antigens used to probe bulk cultures of lesion-infiltrating T cells .
The first available specimens in our ongoing studies ( 19 ) were a set of four biopsy specimens ( 2 mm each ) obtained from a day-5 ( virus culture positive ) buttock lesion due to a recurrence of HSV-2 in patient 1 ( 17 ) .

We previously found three epitopes within VP16 ( Table 3 ) , all HSV-2 type specific ( 14 ) , and detected proliferative responses to full-length VP16 in bulk cultures of genital HSV-2 lesion-infiltrating lymphocytes from four of seven ( 57 % ) patients ( 19 ) .
We sought additional peptide epitopes within VP16 by two strategies .
The first strategy was to screen panels of clones recovered from lesion vesicle fluid for reactivity with recombinant VP16 of HSV-2 , followed by epitope mapping with peptides .
Peptides containing amino acids 185 to 197 and the overlapping pair 209-221 and 213-225 were stimulatory for TCC RH.13 and KM.7 , respectively ( Table 3 ) .
All other VP16 peptides were negative ( < 500 cpm [ data not The second strategy involved use of PBMC as the starting material and secondary in vitro stimulation with recombinant baculovirus-derived VP16 .
Clones ( BM.17 and $ B.17 ) from two individuals recognized the same peptide ( amino acids 437 to 449 ) , as well as a B-galactosidase-VP16 fusion protein and whole virus .
All three newly defined VP16 epitopes were type com-mon , shared by HSV-1 and HSV-2 whole-virus preparations , as expected from sequence data ( 6 ) .

The HLA restriction of the TCC-recogniz-ing antigens encoded near 0.7 map units was determined in detail .
Proliferation of TCC 4.2E1 , specific for VP22 105-126 , is inhibited 84 % by an anti-DP MAb but less than 20 % by an anti-DR or anti-DQ MAb .
TCC 4.2E1 is from a DPB1*2001/ DPB1*0402 heterozygous donor .
Allogeneic EBV-LCL bearing DPB1*2001 but not DPB1*0402 present antigen ( Table 4 ) , establishing restriction by DPB1*2001 .
Proliferation of TCC 2.3 , specific for U , 50 , was inhibited by an anti-DR MAb but not by an anti-DP or anti-DQ MAb .
This clone is from a DRB1*0301/BRB1*0701 heterozygous donor .
Allogeneic PBMC from a DRB1*0301 donor presented antigen , consistent with binding of antigenic peptide to this allele .
However , presentation by one of the linked DR gene products DRwS52 and DRw53 can not be ruled out .
Additional HLA restriction studies are summarized in Table 5 .
The HLA restriction of TCC BM.17 was studied in detail , since the antigenic peptide , VP16 437-449 , overlaps two previously described ( 18 , 21 ) VP16 epitopes ( Table 3 ) .
Proliferation of TCC BM.17 and the similar clone $ B.17 was inhibited 90 % by an anti-DQ MAb but less than 25 % by an anti-DR or anti-DP MAb .
Donors 8 and 9 are heterozygous for HLA DQB1*0201/0501 .
At high concentrations of peptide , both DQB1*0201 and DQB1*0501 homozygous EBV-LCL appeared to present antigen to TCC BM.17 .
However , DQB1*0501 homozygous cells presented peptide much more efficiently than DQB1*0201 homozygous cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
Thus , three different but overlapping epitopes in VP16 431-449 are presented by HLA DQB1*0302 , DQB1*0201 , and DQB1*0501 .
CTL activity of tegument-specific CD4 TCC .
Cytotoxic activities of the CD4 TCC with newly and previously identified spec-ificities were tested by using EBV-LCL target cells ( Table 5 ) .
All clones tested displayed cytolytic activity towards peptide-loaded target cells .
Cytolytic activity against target cells infected with HSV-2 showed greater variability .
VP22-specific TCC 4.2E1 was active , while VP22-specific TCC from other donors were not .
Among the seven VP16-specific TCC tested , six displayed greater than 10 % cytotoxicity towards HSV-2-infected target cells .
The single U , 21- and U , 50-specific TCC were not active against virus-infected target cells .
DISCUSSION HSV-specific T cells selectively infiltrate recurrent genital HSV-2 lesions ( 16 ) .
Local CTL activity , with CD4- and CD8 mediated components , is correlated with viral clearance ( 19 ) .
The antigens recognized by local HSV-specific T cells are diverse and in many cases unknown ( 17 ) .
In this report , we document recognition of tegument proteins VP22 and U , 21 and the viral dUTPase , and we extend our previous observations on tegument protein VP16 .
HSV has several characteristics which facilitate the expression cloning system described in this report .
Genomic double-stranded DNA can be used directly , since introns are rare in the HSV genome .
The same HSV -2 strain , HG52 ( 9 ) , was used to screen candidate lesion-derived TCC and make protein libraries .
The relatively low degree of strain variability ( 28 ) between HSV-2 strains in the donors and HGS52 might rarely lead to omission of an epitope ( s ) recognized in vivo ; application to viruses with more strain variation would benefit from the use of autologous isolates .
Notably , reactivity with VP22 was detected in two independent expression cloning experiments with lesion-infiltrating TCC from two donors .
VP22 reactivity was also detected during screening of the first available set of bulk lesion-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures .
We plan assessment of the reactivity of bulk and cloned T cells from the herpetic lesions of additional subjects after expression of full-length antigens .
Thus far , 10 additional clones from three patients have been negative with fragments of U ; , 49 , U ; 21 , and U , 50 discussed in this report ; assessment of the relative immunodominance of tegument TABLE 4 .

72 , 1998 CD4 T CELLS SPECIFIC FOR HSV-2 TEGUMENT PROTEINS - 7481 ing of dUTPase antigen from infected-cell debris .
Lysis of HSV -infected cells by dUTPase-specific TCC 4.2E1 indicates that , at least in vitro , presentation of endogenous antigen can occur .
Immune responses to VP22 may be an obstacle to its use for delivery of exogenous materials ( 30 ) in vivo .
Conversely , since polypeptides expressed as C-terminal fusions to VP22 can be cotransported into cells , expression of proteins as VP22 fusions may be of interest as a type of adjuvant preparation .
This hypothesis can be tested by expression of heterologous epitopes in VP22 .
VP16 and VP22 of HSV-1 are strongly , noncovalently associated in infected cells as shown by coimmunoprecipi-tation .
These proteins colocalize in the perinuclear areas of cells ( 10 , 11 ) .
Possibly , this association plays a role in stimulating the apparently high level of CD4 T-cell response to VP16 .
All of the lesion-derived tegument-specific CD4 TCC studied had cytolytic potential against maximally sensitized ( pep-tide-loaded ) target cells .
Why do only some clones kill virus-infected cells ?
Possibly , some epitopes are not presented in infected APC , and some may be processed at very low levels , below a threshold needed to trigger a cytolytic response .
Thus far , with our small number of clones , we have not observed a consistent relationship between antigenic specificity or HLA restricting locus and sensitization , by viral infection , to lysis by CD4 T cells .
In summary , expression cloning has allowed the discovery of novel HSV T-cell antigens .
The in situ enrichment of antigen-specific CD4 T cells in lesions allows study of the antigenic repertoire unbiased by secondary in vitro stimulation with antigen .
The favorable characteristics of the HSV genome allow direct use of libraries of whole-virus DNA .

APC are EBV-LCL that are either autologous ( solid circles ) , homozygous for HLA DQB1*0501 ( open inverted triangles ) , or homozygous for HLA DQB1*0201 ( solid squares ) .
specific responses in comparison to HSV glycoproteins is not possible at this time .
Tegument antigens may be suitable targets for lesion-infiltrating CD4 T cells because of their abundance .
VP16 and VP22 are present in large amounts : on the order of 1.6 x 10° molecules of VP16 ( 45 ) and 2.5 x 10° to 2.8 x 10° molecules of VP22 ( 23 ) are incorporated into each virion in HSV-1 .
Less information is available for U , 21 ( 2 , 3 ) .
The viral dUTPase is the first nonvirion component documented to be a target of the HSV -specific CD4 T-cell response ; no information is available concerning its relative abundance .
This enzyme , like VP16 and VP22 , localizes to the nuclei of cells infected with HSV-2 ( but not HSV-1 ) ( 40 ) .
Antigen presentation in vivo may occur after endogenous synthesis of dUTPase in infected cells or scaveng- cells and correlation of these factors with the duration , clinical severity , or complications of HSV infections , such as HSV ker-atitis , may be assisted by application of the methods in this report .
