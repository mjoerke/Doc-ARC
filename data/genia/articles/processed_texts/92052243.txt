Fischbach , August 14 , 1991 ( received for review May 28 , 1991 ) ABSTRACT We demonstrate that JunD , a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex , activates transcription of the human proenkephalin gene in a fashion that is completely dependent upon the cAMP-dependent protein kinase , protein kinase A. Activation of proenkephalin transcription by JunD is dependent upon a previously characterized cAMP- , phorbol ester- , and Ca**-inducible enhancer , and JunD is shown to bind the enhancer as a homodimer .
Another component of the AP-1 transcription complex , JunB , is shown to inhibit activation mediated by JunD .
As a homodimer JunB is unable to bind the enhancer ; however in the presence of c-Fos , high-affinity binding is observed .
Furthermore , JunD is shown to activate transcription of genes linked to both cAMP and phorbol ester response elements in a protein kinase A-dependent fashion , further blurring the distinction between these response elements .
These results demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of an AP-1l-related protein is regulated by the cAMP-dependent second-messenger pathway and suggest that JunD and other AP-1-related proteins may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression by cAMP-dependent intracellular signaling pathways .
In the nervous system , signals transmitted across synapses are known to regulate gene expression in the postsynaptic cell ( 1-5 ) .
This process involves membrane depolarization and/or the binding of neurotransmitters to their cell surface receptors , and subsequent signal amplification via second-messenger pathways and protein kinases .
Analysis of neural regulation of gene expression has focused primarily on two types of genes : the immediate early genes ( 4 , 5 ) and genes encoding peptide neurotransmitters ( 2 , 3 ) .
Immediate early genes are thought to function as `` third trans-ducing neural activity into long-term changes in neural functioning by activating or repressing specific target genes-for example , the genes encoding peptide neurotransmitters ( 4 , 5 ) .
Regulation of the opioid precursor proenkephalin by neural activity and intracellular signaling pathways is well documented ( 6-11 , 12 ) .
A 30-base-pair ( bp ) region of DNA closely linked to the proenkephalin promoter has been shown to act as a second-messenger-inducible DNA enhancer that regulates transcription of this gene in response to the cAMP- , phorbol ester- , and Ca**+-dependent intracellular signaling pathways ( 13-16 ) .
Located within this enhancer are two adjacent DNA elements called cAMP response elements ( CRE-1 and CRE-2 ) , which act cooperatively to regulate proenkephalin transcription in response to all three intracellular signaling pathways ( 14-16 ) .
The molecular mechanisms by which transcription factors mediate cellular responsiveness to second-messenger pathways are in most cases not well understood ; however , in the case of the cAMP-dependent pathway , clearly an interesting The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .
This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement `` in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
10222 and complex story is unfolding .
The activated catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( protein kinase A , PKA ) appears to translocate to the nucleus ( 17 ) .
Further evidence supports a model in which PKA then phosphorylates a single residue of the CRE-binding protein ( CREB ) ( 18 ) , leading to the cAMP-dependent activation of somatostatin transcription at the CRE ( TGACGTCA ) ( 19 ) .
In addition , phosphorylation by other kinases at sites adjacent to the CREB PKA site also plays a role ( 20 ) .
In contrast to the somatostatin gene , where a single element is sufficient for cAMP regulation ( 19 ) , analysis in our laboratory indicates that two adjacent and closely related elements are necessary for cAMP regulation of the proenkephalin gene ( 14 ) .
CRE-2 ( TGCGTCA ) is a site that most closely resembles the phorbol ester response element ( tetradecanoylphorbol acetate response element , TRE ) ( TGACTCA ) but also contains the core CGTCA element found in most CREs ( 14 , 19 ) .
Previous studies have shown that affinity-purified AP-1 proteins bind with high affinity to CRE-2 ( 14 , 15 ) .
This information focused our attention on proteins of the AP-1 complex ( Fos , Jun , and related molecules ) , which were originally identified by their ability to bind and activate transcription via the TRE ( 3-5 ) .
We show here that JunD , in the presence of the catalytic subunit of PKA , transactivates the proenkephalin enhancer at the CRE-2 element .
JunB is shown to antagonize activation mediated by JunD .
DNA binding studies indicate that JunB alone does not bind CRE-2 but can bind this element in the presence of c-Fos .
Together these findings suggest that AP-1 complexes involving JunD and JunB may act to induce or repress proenkephalin transcription in response to cAMP .
In addition , our data suggest that cAMP regulates gene expression through at least two pathways : one that involves previously described CREB/ATF proteins acting at classic CRE sequences ( 18-21 ) and a second pathway involving AP-1 proteins acting at both CRE- and TRE-like sequences .

RESULTS Expression and Regulation of Proenkephalin , JunD , JunB , and c-Fos in C6 Glioma Cells .
To determine the time course and protein synthesis dependence of proenkephalin activation by cAMP we analyzed the kinetics of a CAT mRNA ( Fig .
2A ) encoded by a stably expressed proenkephalin-CAT fusion gene in C6 glioma cells stimulated by forskolin , an activator of adenylate cyclase , and IBMX , an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase .
Induction of cytoplasmic RNA was observed within 15 min of forskolin addition , peaked between 1 and 2 hr , and was significantly reduced by 8 hr .
Induction was not blocked by pretreatment with cycloheximide ( data not shown ) or anisomycin ( Fig .
24 ) ; however , the decline in message levels observed between 3 and 8 hr was completely blocked by these protein synthesis inhibitors ( Fig .
2A ) .
Protein synthesis inhibitors in the absence of forskolin and IBMX had no effect on proenkephalin expression ( data not shown ) .
Endogenous proenkephalin transcripts show a similar pattern of expression although the time course is less informative due to the high level of basal proenkephalin mRNA and its long half-life compared with CAT mRNA ( 0.5 day versus several hours ) ( 11 ) .
As a first step in determining what role different AP-1 components may play in the forskolin-induced stimulation of proenkephalin transcription , we analyzed the expression of mRNAs encoding three AP-1 factors-JunD , JunB , and c-Fos-before and after treatment of C6 glioma cells with forskolin and IBMX .
Significant levels of junD RNA were constitutively expressed in the C6 glioma cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
One hour after treatment with forskolin and IBMX , junD RNA levels decreased severalfold and remained lowered up to 14 hr later .

Transactivation by JunD Is Dependent Upon PKA and CRE-2 .
To test the functional activity of different AP-1 components at the proenkephalin enhancer , we introduced full-length cDNAs encoding JunD and JunB into expression vectors utilizing a Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) promoter/ enhancer and the simian virus 40 polyadenylylation site .
These expression vectors ( pRSVJunD and pRSV JunB ) were then used to drive constitutive expression in a number of different cell lines after transfection and transient expression .
Expression was first investigated in undifferentiated F9 cells , as these cells express low or undetectable levels of AP-1 DNA-binding activity ( 30 ) .
The proenkephalin-CAT fusion gene , pENKAT-12 ( 13 ) , was expressed in these cells at very low levels in transient transfection assays ( Fig .
34 , bar a ) .
Cotransfection with pRSVJunD had no effect on CAT expression driven by the proenkephalin promoter , whereas cotransfection with a plasmid expressing the catalytic subunit of PKA , pMTCaneo ( 27 ) , produced a reproducible 2- to S-fold increase in CAT expression ( Fig .
34 , bars b and c ) .
Cotransfection of pENKAT-12 together with JunD- and PKA-expressing plasmids produced a 10- to 30-fold increase in CAT expression ( Fig .
34 , bar d ) , indicating that transactivation of the proenkephalin promoter by JunD is dependent upon expression of an active PKA catalytic subunit .
Similar observations ( Fig .
3B ) have been made in C6 glioma cells which express the proenkephalin gene and regulate it in a forskolin dependent fashion .
However , because transfections with PKA alone produce such large effects in these cells , it was necessary to reduce the amount of pMTCaneo in order to observe the effect of JunD .
To map the elements essential for transactivation by JunD , we analyzed the effects of pRSVJunD and pMTCaneo on plasmids that contained multiple copies of each element ( CRE-2 , CRE-1 , AP-4 ; see Fig .
1 ) cloned into a plasmid , pENKAT-A80 , that has all enhancer elements removed and no longer responds to the activation of second-messenger pathways .
Multiple copies of the CRE-2 element but not the CRE-1 or AP-4 element reconstitute wild-type enhancer transactivation by JunD and PKA in transiently transfected F9 cells ( Fig .
3C ) .
Furthermore , point mutations within CRE-2 that block second-messenger regulation in vivo ( 14 ) also block transactivation by JunD ( Fig .
3C ) .
All CAT activities shown are normalized to BGal activities measured from the same extracts as described previously ( 13 ) .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) JunB Inhibits PK A-Dependent Transactivation by JunD .
To gain insight into the functional effects of JunB we carried out cotransfection experiments with pRSVJunB .
In F9 cells , JunB alone or together with PKA had no effect on transcription from the proenkephalin-CAT fusion gene ( Fig .
4 ) .
The small , 3-fold effect seen together with PKA was indistinguishable from the effect seen with PKA alone .
However , when a JunB plasmid was cotransfected with JunD- and PKA-expressing plasmids , a dose-dependent reduction in JunD transactivation was observed ( Fig .
4 ) .
When cotransfected with JunD at a 4-fold molar excess , JunB dramatically inhibited the transactivation observed with JunD and PKA .
Neither JunB nor JunD had any effect on the pRSV BGal plasmid , which was cotransfected as an internal control .
This observation makes it unlikely that inhibition by JunB is due to the titration of limiting factors required by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter .
Characterization of JunD and JunB Binding at the Proenkephalin Enhancer .
To examine the binding of JunD and JunB to CRE-2 , we transcribed RNA encoding JunD , JunB , and c-Fos and then translated these individually and in combi-nations , as described below , in rabbit reticulocyte lysates .
Fig .
5A shows in vitro translated , JunD , JunB , and c-Fos proteins .
Lysates used in the DNA binding assays described below were translated in parallel under identical conditions except for the replacement of [ > S ) Jmethionine with nonradioactive methionine .
Control lysates showed no specific binding to a 30-bp oligonucleotide spanning the proenkephalin enhancer from -110 to -80 ( Fig .
5B , lane 1 ) .
However , lysates programmed with JunD RNA produced a shifted band ( arrowhead , Fig .
5B , lane 2 ) whose formation was specifically inhibited by unlabeled proenkephalin enhancer oligonucleotide ( lanes 3 and 4 ) but not by AP-2 or AP-4 oligonucleotides and only very weakly by a CRE-1 oligonucleotide ( lanes 5-7 ) .
Both TRE and CRE oligonucleotides competed effectively for JunD DNA binding ( lanes 8-11 ) .
We next attempted to correlate binding of JunD with the in vivo functional activity of a series of single base substitution mutations spanning CRE-2 .
In these experiments a wild-type CRE-2 oligonucleotide ( -93 to -85 bp , see Fig .
2 ) was used as nonradioactive competitor ( Fig .
5B , lanes 12 and 13 ) and this competition was compared with that of CRE-2 oligonucleotides containing the indicated single base substitution mutation ( lanes 14-16 ) .

JunD transactivation of proenkephalin is PKA-dependent and maps to the CRE-2 .
( A ) F9 cells were cotransfected with 5 ug of pENKAT-12 and pRSV BGal in various combinations with pRSVJunD and pMTCaneo as follows : bar a , pENKAT-12 alone ; bar b , pENKAT-12 plus 5 ug of pRSVJunD ; bar c , pENKAT-12 plus 10 ug of pMTCaneo ; bar d , pENKAT-12 plus 5 ug of pRSVJunD and 10 ug of pMTCaneo .
The total amount of DNA was maintained at 40 ug with pGEM-3 .
( B ) C6 cells were cotransfected as described above with two exceptions , the amount of pMTCaneo was reduced to 2 ug and the total amount of DNA was maintained at 25 ug with pGEM-3 .

CAT-expressing plasmids also were cotransfected with 5 ug of pRSVJunD and 10 ug of pMTCaneo ( striped bars ) .
All CAT activities were normalized for expression of pRSVBGal .

Five nanograms of pRSV BGal also was included in each transfection as an internal control for normalization of CAT activity .

produced the most severe effect on JunD binding , leading to a lack of competition .
Although the CRE-2 oligonucleotide competed for JunD binding it did not compete as well as oligonucleotides that included both CRE-1 and CRE-2 and flanking sequences ( compare lanes 3 and 4 with 12 and 13 ) .
As shown in Fig .
5C , binding of in vitro translated JunB to the enhancer was not observed ( lane 2 ) .
Because JunB is known to dimerize with JunD ( 29 ) and c-Fos ( 29 , 31 ) , we also analyzed the interaction of these complexes with CRE-2 .
As shown in lane 3 , lysates programmed with equal amounts of junB and junD RNAs bound the proenkephalin enhancer probe with an affinity similar to that of junD-programmed lysates ( compare lanes 1 and 3 ) .
Consistent with previous reports using AP-1 oligonucleotides ( 12 , 29 , 31 ) , binding to CRE-2 was observed when c-Fos and JunB were cotranslated ( Fig .
5C , lane 6 ) , whereas JunB or c-Fos alone did not bind ( lanes 2 and 4 ) .
Also note that c-Fos stimulated the binding of JunD to the proenkephalin enhancer ( lane 5 ) .
Classic CRE and TRE also Mediate PKA-Dependent Transcription via JunD .
Because the proenkephalin enhancer contains a hybrid TRE/CRE-like element , CRE-2 , we tested the ability of JunD to transactivate `` 'classic `` TRE and CRE elements in a PK A-dependent fashion by transiently trans-fecting F9 cells with plasmids containing the somatostatin CRE , pA ( -71 ) CAT ( 32 ) , or the collagenase TRE , p-73Col-TRE ( 30 ) , together with pRSVJunD and pMTCaneo .
As shown in Fig .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) - 10225 indicate that JunD can act at both CREs and TREs to stimulate transcription in a PKA-dependent fashion .
DISCUSSION Analysis of the time course of proenkephalin-CAT RNA expression in C6 glioma cells after treatment with forskolin or with forskolin and protein synthesis inhibitors suggests that the rapid stimulation of the proenkephalin-CAT RNA by forskolin is independent of new protein synthesis and hence mediated by preexisting proteins .
Several properties of JunD suggest that this molecule may play a role in the rapid increase in RNA levels observed after stimulation by cAMP and possibly other intracellular signaling pathways .
First , unlike all other known members of the Fos/Jun family , the level of junD RNA is constitutively expressed in a wide variety of cell types ( 24 , 33 ) .
Second , the JunD protein is a very stable component of the AP-1 complex , with a half-life of 6 hr in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts ( 34 ) .
JunD transactivates the proenkephalin promoter in a cAMP-dependent fashion and specifically binds CRE-2 with high affinity as a homodimer .
Finally , point mutations that eliminate inducible enhancer function in vivo ( 14 ) also block the binding of JunD to CRE-2 .
Experiments using in vitro translated JunD suggest that this protein binds to CRE-2 both as a homodimer and also as a heterodimer when cotranslated with c-Fos .
Although we can not eliminate the possibility that our JunD-expressing lysates also express c-Fos , the observation that JunB binding is entirely dependent on c-Fos cotranslation suggests that the lysates contain little if any endogenous Fos .
The observation that JunD binds CRE-2 as a homodimer together with the lack of c-Fos expression in undifferentiated F9 cells ( 30 ) suggest that the JunD homodimer may mediate the PKA-dependent activation of proenkephalin transcription .
How does PKA regulate the transcriptional activity of JunD ?
It has been shown that JunD is a phosphoprotein ( 34 ) .
It is unknown whether it can be phosphorylated in vitro or in vivo by PKA .
Unlike CREB , JunD does not contain a PKA consensus site of the type Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser .
However , a single site of the Lys-Xaa-Xaa-Ser type is present that is not present in the closely related JunB molecule .
Alternatively , PKA may regulate dimerization of JunD with itself or other Jun/Fos/CREB-like factors or may induce expression of other AP-1 proteins , which , like Fos , can heterodimerize with JunD .
Significantly , cotransfection with a c-Fos-expressing plasmid has little or no effect on JunD transactivation ( data not shown ) , suggesting that PKA probably does FIG .

PKA-dependent transactivation of TRE and CRE DNA elements .
F9 cells were transfected with 5 ug of pENKAT-12 , 5 ug of pA ( -71 ) CAT ( 33 ) , or 5 ug of p-73Col-TRE ( 30 ) under three different conditions : control , no cotransfected expression plasmid ; PKA , 5 ug of pMTCaneo ; JunD/PKA , 5 ug of pRSVJunD and 5 ug of pMTCaneo .
CAT activity was normalized to BGal expression .
These data were repeated several times .
not act simply to induce c-Fos in F9 cells .
Finally , PKA may directly regulate JunD DNA binding , as has been recently reported for protein kinase C and c-Jun ( 35 ) .
In addition to activating proenkephalin transcription , forskolin also rapidly activates synthesis of junB and c-fos mRNA in C6 glioma cells .
JunB has been shown to repress c-Jun-dependent activation of the c-Jun promoter ( 30 ) and to inhibit the transforming activity of v-Jun ( 36 ) .
Our cotransfection experiments demonstrate that JunB also is a potent inhibitor of the PKA-dependent activation of proenkephalin transcription by JunD and suggest that induction of JunB may be related to the protein synthesis-dependent reduction of proenkephalin mRNA that is apparent 3-8 hr after forskolin stimulation .
It has been reported in rodent hippocampal granule cells that junD mRNA is constitutively expressed ( 21 ) and that proenkephalin ( 9 , 10 ) , junB ( 21 , 22 ) , and c-fos ( 10 , 21 , 22 ) mRNAs are induced after electrical or chemical stimulation of the dentate gyrus .
These data are consistent with a model in which preexisting JunD would mediate the rapid cAMP-dependent activation of the proenkephalin enhancer , while the products of immediate early genes , for example JunB or c-Fos , whose messages are induced by activation of second-messenger pathways would be involved in subsequent inactivation .
There are at least four mechanisms that can explain the inhibitory effect of JunB on the PK A-dependent activation of proenkephalin transcription by JunD .
( # ) JunB could compete with JunD as a homodimer for binding to CRE-2 .
Our inability to detect binding of JunB homodimer to CRE-2 makes this possibility unlikely .
( ii ) JunB may form heterodimers with JunD , inhibiting the ability of JunD to bind DNA or to activate transcription in response to PKA .
It has been shown that JunD/JunB heterodimers form in vitro ( 29 ) , and our data indicate that the JunD/JunB cotranslation product does not strongly inhibit DNA binding .

JunB may complex with a protein other than JunD and compete directly with JunD homodimers for binding at CRE-2 .
Because c-fos is rapidly and transiently coinduced with junB in many cell types and because c-Fos stimulates binding of JunB to CRE-2 , it is a good candidate .
This mechanism seems unlikely to occur in F9 cells , as these cells do not express c-Fos .
We can not , however , rule out the possibility that PKA acts to induce c-fos in F9 cells .
( iv ) Jun-B may act to inhibit JunD-stimulated transcription by competing with JunD for a required `` 'coactivator `` that plays a critical role in the activation process .
Although much attention has been focused on the role of CREB as a mediator of cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation , our results demonstrate that members of the AP-1 complex also may play a critical role in both activation and Proc .

Several recent studies have shown that AP-1 proteins , in addition to binding the TRE or AP-1 site , also bind the CRE with equal or higher affinity ( 29 , 31 ) .
Other studies have indicated that TREs can regulate transcription in response to stimulation of the cAMP-dependent pathway ( 23 ) .
Taken together with our findings that AP-1 proteins also mediate cAMP-dependent gene regulation , these data suggest that JunD , JunB , and perhaps other components of the AP-1 complex may be important regulators of CRE as well as TRE function .
