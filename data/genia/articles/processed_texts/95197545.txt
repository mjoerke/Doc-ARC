Identification of Human TR2 Orphan Receptor Response Element in the Transcriptional Initiation Site of the Simian Virus 40 Major Late Promoter* Han-Jung Lee and Chawnshang Changt ( Received for publication , October 19 , 1994 ) From the Department of Human Oncology and the Endocrinology-Reproductive Physiology Program , Comprehensive Cancer Center , University of Wisconsin , Madison , Wisconsin 53792 A DNA response element ( TR2RE-SV40 ) for the TR2 orphan receptor , a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily , has been identified in the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) +55 region ( nucleotide numbers 368-389 , 5'-GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCATGGA-3 ' ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay , using in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor with a molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons , showed a specific binding with high affinity ( dissociation constant = 9 nM ) for this DNA sequence .
DNA-swap experiments using chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase assay demonstrated that androgen can suppress the transcriptional activities of SV40 early promoter via the interaction between this TR2RE-SV40 and the chimeric receptor AR/TR2/AR with the DNA-binding domain of the TR2 orphan receptor flanked by the N-terminal and androgen-binding domains of the androgen receptor .
In addition , this TR2RE-SV40 can function as a repressor to suppress the transcriptional activities of both SV40 early and late promoters .
Together , these data suggest the TR2RE-SV40 may represent the first identified natural DNA response element for the TR2 orphan receptor that may function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression .
Several members of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily , including the androgen receptor ( AR ) ' , estrogen receptor , glucocorticoid receptor , progesterone receptor , mineralocorticoid receptor , thyroid receptor ( T & R ) , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; , receptor ( VDR ) , and retinoid acid receptor ( RAR ) , play important roles in the control of vertebrate differentiation and development ( 1 ) .
These nuclear receptors act as trans-regulators of transcription .
Upon binding with their cognate ligands , these hormone-receptor complexes interact with cis-acting DNA elements , termed hormone response elements ( HREs ) , to modulate the transcription of target genes .

Human testicular receptor 2 ( TR2 ) is one of the first orphan receptors identified that share structural homology with members of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily ( 3-6 ) .
The TR2 orphan receptor cDNA was isolated from human prostate and testis cDNA libraries with a probe homologous to a highly conserved DNA-binding domain common to steroid hormone receptors .
The TR2 orphan receptor cDNA encodes a protein of 603 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons ( 4 , 5 ) .
The expression of the TR2 orphan receptor has been detected in various cell lines and tissues , including the human prostatic carcinoma cell line LNCaP , testis , ventral prostate , and seminal vesical ( 7 ) .
The HREs for steroid hormone receptors are structurally related but functionally distinct ( 8 ) .
Based on the finger model , the first zinc finger in the DNA-binding domain of steroid hormone receptors may determine target HRE specificity .
The three amino acids at the C-terminal region of the first zinc finger are categorized as the P ( proximal ) box , which is important in base interaction .
Consequently , HREs can be classified into two main categories of repeat consensus sequences based on the P box , the response element for glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor ( ERE ) ( 9 ) .
The glucocorticoid response element group , which includes glucocorticoid receptor , AR , progesterone receptor , and mineralocorticoid receptor , recognizes AGAACA core consensus half-site .
On the other hand , the ERE group , which includes estrogen receptor , T ; R , VDR , RAR , RXR , and many orphan receptors , recognizes AGGTCA half-site .
In addition , five amino acids localized in the second zinc finger , referred to as D ( distal ) box , which is important in dimerization contact forming , are involved in half-HRE spacing functional discrimination .
These two structural determinants ( P and D boxes ) of target gene specificity may suggest a pathway for the coevolution of receptor DNA-binding domains and regulatory gene networks ( 8 , 9 ) .
On the basis of P and D box sequences , the TR2 orphan receptor is assigned to the ERE subfamily and predicted to bind to an AGGTCA repeat .
Recently , several transcriptional factors from HeLa cell nuclear extracts have been suggested to bind to the transcriptional initiation site of the simian virus 40 major late promoter ( SV40-MLP ) .
One of these factors turned out to be the hERR1 orphan receptor ( 6 , 10 ) .
One of the core sequences within the SVA40-MLP was identified as AGGTCA , which could be a potential HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor .
We , therefore , developed several strategies to test this hypothesis .
Herein this paper is the summary of our results showing the TR2RE within SV40-MLP as the first identified natural HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor .

In addition , our preliminary data also suggested that the TR2 orphan receptor can be detected in the nuclear extracts of HeLa cells .
These data suggested that the TR2 orphan receptor could be one of the candidates that may bind to this region and play some role in SV40 gene expression .
To test this hypothesis , we prepared in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor protein for EMSA .
We constructed the full-length TR2 orphan receptor cDNA into pSPUTK , which contains the SP6 promoter with a 5'-untranslated region of the Xenopus B-globin gene and the consensus Kozak translational initiation site ( UTK ) as shown in Fig .
14 .
The mock-translated control expressed in a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system produced no detectable product ( Fig .
1B , lane 2 ) .
In contrast , in vitro translation of pSPUTK-TRZ yielded a protein of the expected molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons for the TR2 orphan receptor ( lane 3 ) .
The minor product probably arose from internal initiation of translation or limited degradation .
TR2 Orphan Receptor Can Bind at +55 Region of the SV40-MLP-To investigate the possible interaction of authentic TRZ orphan receptor with the +55 region of the SV40-MLP , we performed an EMSA .
The probe used in this study was a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the SV40 nucleotide numbers 368-389 ( 5-GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCAT-GGA-3 ' ) ( 19 ) .
A specific DNA-protein complex was visualized in the EMSA with the probe and the TR2 orphan receptor protein prepared as described above ( Fig .
2 , lane 2 ) .
This DNA-protein complex could be eliminated upon the addition of 100-fold molar excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotides ( Zane 3 ) .
In contrast , the DNA-protein complex remained intact in the presence of 100-fold molar excesses of mutated oligonucleotides ( mutant TR2RE ) with a point mutation on the third nucleotide in both repeat motifs ( lane 4 ) .
Furthermore , there was no specific interaction between these oligonucleotides ( TR2RE ) and the in vitro expressed TR3 orphan receptor ( Zane 5 ) , another orphan receptor identified in our laboratory , or a mock-translated product ( data not shown ) .
These results indicated that the TR2 orphan receptor indeed had the ability to specifically bind to the TRZRE , but not to mutant TR2RE , in the SV40-MLP ( Fig .
3 ) .
TR2 Orphan Receptor Can Bind to the TR2RE with High Affinity-To examine the binding affinity between the TR2 orphan receptor and the TRZ2RE in more detail , we employed Scatchard binding analysis for the DNA-protein complexes in the EMSA ( Fig .
4 ) .
Scatchard plot analysis revealed a single binding component for this DNA-protein complex with a dissociation constant ( K , , ) of 9 nm and B. , , , , of 0.3 nm to the TR2RE that fit the range of K , , for steroid receptors and their HREs ( 16 ) .
Ligand Effect on the Interaction between the TR2RE and the TR2 Orphan Receptor-All in vitro binding data suggested that TR2RE could be the potential HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor .
The next question asked was whether this interaction between the TRZRE and the TR2 orphan receptor was ligand TR2RE in the SV40-MLP A R L 5437 S/H X R o 14 R___S_ X R S_X AR TR2 Fic .

All experiments were done in CTS during cell culture .
B dependent .
Unlike classic members of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptors , which have their own ligands to test the ligand dependence , the TR2 orphan receptor is a receptor without a known ligand .
To overcome this problem , we developed a `` DNA swap `` strategy to test this hypothesis .
A chimeric receptor , AR/TR2/AR , with the DNA-binding domain of the TR2 orphan receptor flanked by the N-terminal and androgen-binding domains of the AR ( Fig .
5A ) was created here to study the interaction between the TR2RE and the TR2 orphan receptor .
This chimeric plasmid was cotransfected into HeLa cells with reporter plasmids , which consist of the CAT gene regulated by the SV40 early promoter containing either the TR2RE or mutant TRZ2RE , respectively .
The induction of the CAT gene by androgen was then tested .
As shown in Fig .
5B , androgen clearly suppressed the transcriptional activity of the SV40 early promoter via the interaction between the TR2 orphan receptor and the TR2RE .
However , SV40 early promoter construct with a mutant TR2RE was not affected by androgen in similar transient transfection CAT assay in HeLa cells .
These data demonstrated that ligand can affect the interaction between the TR2RE and the TR2 orphan receptor and further confirmed the TR2RE is the HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor .
TR2 Orphan Receptor Suppresses the Transcriptional Activity of the SV40-MLP via the TR2RE-Thus far , all of our Expression : Reporter : 10 nM R1881 : Fold of CAT Conversion AR/TR2/AR AR/TR2/AR pCMV-AR pSV55wtl pSV55mut1l pMSG-CAT + - + + 250 200 150 4 50 data have supported the idea that SV40-MLP contains the TR2RE , a potential HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor .
We then determined if the TR2 orphan receptor directly can play any role in SV40 gene expression via interaction with the TR2RE .
CAT assay with the cotransfection of mammalian expression vector containing the full-length TR2 orphan receptor cDNA ( pSG5-TR2 ) and either pBL-SVL-CAT ( without the TR2RE ) or pBL-SVLRE-CAT ( with the TR2RE ) reporter into HeLa cells indicated that the TR2 orphan receptor can not affect the transcriptional activity of the SV40-MLP without the TR2RE ( Fig .
6B , lane 1 ) .
In contrast , the TR2 orphan receptor can suppress the transcriptional activity of the SV40-MLP containing the TR2RE region ( lane 2 ) .
These findings suggested that this TR2RE may function as a repressor for the transcriptional activity of the SV40-MLP .
Suppression of SV40-MLP Gene Expression Is Activator Dependent-As our data demonstrated that the TR2 orphan receptor may function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression , we then attempted to determine if the TR2 orphan receptor always binds to the TRZRE and , therefore , constitutively blocks the SV40 gene expression or if the TR2 orphan receptor needs activator ( s ) for the activation of its supression function .
To test this hypothesis , we applied regular FBS versus CTS in the transient transfection CAT assay .

B , induction of CAT activity in HeLa cells cotransfected with the expression plasmid pSG5-TR2 and two different reporter plasmids .
All CAT assays were normalized for the level of B-galactosidase activity .
Each value represents the mean + S.D .
of three independent experiments .
The relative folds of CAT conversion from the cotransfection with pSG5-TR2 and either pBL-SVL-CAT ( lane 1 ) or pBL-SVLRE-CAT ( lane 2 ) are shown .
that the TR2 orphan receptor may have some activator ( s ) in the serum .
As shown in Fig .
7 , the repressor function of the TR2 orphan receptor was dependent on the presence of a potential activator ( s ) in the serum ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
On the other hand , charcoal-treated serum can abolish such suppression by the removal of the potential TR2 activator ( s ) in the serum .
These results further suggested that such activator-dependent suppression of the SV40 gene expression may rely on the interaction between the TR2RE and the TR2 orphan receptor .
As expected , the mutant TRZ2RE had no influence on the suppression of the SV40 gene expression in the presence of either FBS or CTS ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Taken together , these data strongly suggested that the TR2RE is a HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor and functions as a repressor in the SV40 gene expression in an activator-dependent manner .
DISCUSSION It has been previously shown that some orphan receptors may affect the expression of viruses .
For example , chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor can bind to a negative regulatory region in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat ( 20 ) .
Hepatitis B virus enhancer I contains response elements of enhancer binding factor to polyoma C , hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 , and retinoid X receptor ( RXR , , ) ( 21 ) .
The TR3 orphan receptor and nuclear factor I can induce transcription of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat ( 14 , 22 ) .
Recently , hERR1 and other orphan receptors have also been suggested to bind to the transcriptional initiation site of the SV40-MLP that may be in pSGS-TR2 : * + Reporter : a -_ b We 2.5 g 27 R+ e 2 g 1.3 ~ 2 O E bust O 1 7 G s k 6 HL 0.5 - ] o 1 2 volved in the early-to-late shift in the SV40 gene expression ( 10 ) .
Our finding that the TR2 orphan receptor can bind to a negative response element in the transcriptional initiation site of the SV40-MLP will further expand the knowledge of the influence of orphan receptors on the gene expression of viruses .
The AGGTCA motif has been proposed to be the primary target element for the members of the ERE subfamily in the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily ( 8 , 9 ) .
Many family members , including the TR2 orphan receptor identified in the present study , can bind to this core sequence .
However , it is not known yet how distinct sets of target genes are regulated by these nuclear receptors .
In addition to the primary sequence , recent evidence has suggested that the orientation and spacing of repeat core elements determine the specificity of hormonal regulation of these receptors ( Ref .
23 ; also , see Ref .
24 for review ) .
More recently , a novel cooperative dimer interaction within the DNA-binding domains of family members has been proposed ( 25 , 26 ) .
A region in the first zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of the T ; R or RAR can interact with the second zinc finger in the DNA-binding domain of the RXR to promote selective DNA binding to direct repeats spaced by 4 and 5 nucleotides , respectively .
The resulting polarity established by this protein-protein interaction places RXR in the 5'-position or 5'-RXR-RAR-3 ' ) of the direct repeats ( 25 ) .
In addition , the formation of either 5'-T , ; R-VDR-3 ' or 5-VDR-T ; R-3 ' heterodimeric complex can be controlled by the ligand for the downstream receptor .

The TR3 orphan receptor , another orphan receptor identified initially in our laboratory , was used here as a negative control in the EMSA ( Fig .
2 ) .
The TR3 orphan receptor , a human homologue of rat NGFTI-B and mouse nur77 , is also a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily ( 27-29 ) .
It has been demonstrated that rat NGFTI-B can bind to a response element ( NBRE ) , which contains only one AGGTCA half-site ( 30 ) .
Thus , NGFI-B has been grouped into a special monomer binding subfamily .
Herein , we have shown that the TR3 orphan receptor can not bind to the TRZ2RE , an imperfect direct repeat sequence .
This finding is in good agreement with the data from NGFI-B ( 30 ) .
Based on the binding affinity between some members of the ERE subfamily and the TR2RE , we found that the TR2 orphan receptor prefers TR2RE to other natural HREs , such as T ; RE , RARE , and NBRE . ``
The binding affinity between the TR2 orphan receptor and the TR2RE is high and specific .
Interest-ingly , sequence analysis of the TR2RE in the GenBank data base indicated that human hepatitis B virus and human pap-illomavirus type 33 may also contain binding sites for the TR2 orphan receptor .
Whether the TR2 orphan receptor has any * T. Lin and C. Chang , manuscript in preparation .

( 31 ) showed that the TR2 orphan receptor is not constitutively active .
The chimera receptor ( PR/PR/TR2 ) , which replaces the ligand-binding domain of progesterone receptor with that of the TR2 orphan receptor , can be activated by dopamine , a neurotransmitter .
Our previous report ( 28 ) showed that chimeric receptor TR3/AR/TR3 can be constitutively activated in both COS1 and prostate PC-3 cells but not TR2/AR/TR2 .
These two independent data all suggested that the TR2 orphan receptor may need its cognate ligand for the activation .
In summary , our data indicated that this TR2RE is indeed the first identified natural HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor .
Moreover , our results showing that TR2RE can function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression may suggest that several potential HREs for the TR2 orphan receptor could exist in other viruses .
This prediction may open a new chapter for the study of interaction between the viral expression and the TR2 orphan receptor .
