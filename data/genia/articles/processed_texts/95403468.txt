Direct Demonstration of NFAT , Dephosphorylation and Nuclear Localization in Activated HT-2 Cells Using a Specific NFAT , Polyclonal Antibody* Valerie A. Ruff and Karen L. Leacht ( Received for publication , June 26 , 1995 ) From the Department of Cell Biology and Inflammation Research , The Upjohn Company , Kalamazoo , Michigan 49001 Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) regulates transcription of a number of cytokine genes , and NFAT DNA binding activity is stimulated following T cell activation .
Several lines of evidence have suggested that NFAT is a substrate for calcineurin , a serine/threonine phosphatase .
Using a polyclonal antibody to murine NFAT , , , Western blot analysis of various mouse tissues demonstrated that the 110-130-kDa NFAT , , protein was highly expressed in thymus and spleen .
Treatment of immunoprecipitated NFAT , , from untreated HT-2 cells with calcineurin resulted in the dephosphorylation of NFAT , , , demonstrating that NFAT , is an in vitro substrate for calcineurin .
NFAT , , immunoprecipitated from P-labeled HT-2 cells migrated as an approximately 120-kDa protein that was localized to the cytosol of the cells .
Treatment of the cells with ionomycin resulted in a decrease in the molecular weight of NFAT , , and a loss of *°P , consistent with NFAT , , dephosphorylation .
The dephosphorylation of NFAT , was accompanied by localization of the protein to the nuclear fraction .
Both of these events were blocked by preincubation of the cells with FK506 , a calcineurin inhibitor , consistent with the hypothesis that NFAT , is a calcineurin substrate in cells .
The immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporin A ( CsA ) `` and FK506 inhibit the early steps of antigen-stimulated T cell activation .
These drugs prevent activation of a variety of cytokine genes , including IL-2 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimu-lating factor , IL-4 , and tumor necrosis factor a ( for review , see Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
IL-2 plays a key role in controlling T cell proliferation , and consequently , numerous studies have focussed on understanding IL-2 gene regulation .
The results of these studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation requires nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , a DNA binding protein , which binds to specific sites on the regulatory regions of the cytokine genes ( 3-6 ) .
Molecular cloning and biochemical studies have provided insights into the actions of NFAT .
The approximately 120-kDa NFAT is a member of a gene family whose members appear to contain a Rel homology region , which is important for DNA * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

binding activity .
Two members were identified : NFAT , was cloned from a human T cell library ( 7 ) , while NFAT , was purified and cloned from murine T cells ( 8 ) .
In addition , several alternatively spliced forms of NFATp were identified ( 2 ) .
NFAT , and NFAT , are approximately 73 % identical in the Rel homology region , although they share little similarity outside that domain .
In unactivated T cells , NFAT DNA binding activity is localized primarily in the cytosol , and following T cell activation , activity is detected in the nucleus .
Nuclear NFAT forms a complex with Fos and Jun , and mutations in NFAT that inhibit binding to these proteins eliminate NFAT-medi-ated gene transcription .
Furthermore , treatment of cells with either CsA or FK506 inhibits the appearance of NFAT binding activity in the nucleus ( 8 , 9-11 ) .
An understanding of the link between the drugs FK506 and CsA and NFAT has recently started to emerge with the identification of calcineurin ( CaN ) as a cellular target of the drugs .
FK506 and CsA bind to their respective immunophilins , FKBP-12 and cyclophilin A , and the drug-immunophilin complexes bind to and inhibit the activity of CaN , a calmodulin-de-pendent phosphatase ( 12 , 13 ) .
Overexpression of a constitutively active form of CaN in T cells renders the cells more resistant to the effects of the drugs , and the ability of a number of FK506 and CsA analogues to inhibit the phosphatase activity of CaN correlates with their ability to inhibit T cell activation ( 14 ) .
Evidence suggests that CaN is not just involved in mediating the actions of FK506 and CsA but that the enzyme plays a role in the physiological pathway of T cell activation .
O'Keefe , et al .
( 15 ) demonstrated that in cells transfected with CaN , PMA-and ionophore-stimulated IL-2-driven gene expression was stimulated approximately 2-fold .
Furthermore , in cells overex-pressing a constitutively active form of CaN , IL-2-driven gene expression was stimulated approximately 150-fold in the presence of PMA alone , indicating that active CaN can replace the usual requirement for ionophore .
Similar results were obtained by Clipstone and Crabtree ( 16 ) , who demonstrated reporter gene activity in CaN-transfected cells at suboptimal concentrations of ionomycin that elicited little or no activity in control cells .
Taken together , these results demonstrate that CaN overexpression augments T cell activation resulting from both calcium and PKC stimulation and suggest that CaN plays a key role in this process .
The studies with CsA and FK506 led to the suggestion that NFAT is a CaN substrate , either direct or indirect , in T cells .
First , indirect evidence indicates that NFAT , is a phosphoprotein .
Fractionation of Jurkat cell cytosol demonstrated that NFAT DNA binding activity is detected with proteins in a molecular mass range of 94-116 kDa , suggesting heterogeneity in the size of the NFAT protein ( 17 ) .
To determine whether 22602 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog NFAT , Dephosphorylation and Nuclear Localization NFAT phosphorylation could explain the heterogeneity , McCaffrey , et al .
( 18 ) treated cell extracts enriched for NFAT with alkaline phosphatase .
This enzymatic treatment resulted in a shift in NFAT binding activity from the 127-143-kDa molecular weight fraction to a 101-113-kDa fraction , which is consistent with the hypothesis that NFAT is a phosphoprotein .
Sec-ond , treatment of purified NFAT with purified bovine brain CaN also resulted in a shift in the molecular weight of NFAT , suggesting that NFAT is an in vitro substrate for CaN ( 19 ) .
Whether NFAT is a direct CaN substrate in intact cells has not yet been determined , however .
In the majority of reported NFAT studies , NFAT DNA binding activity has been the end point usually measured , since relatively little is known about the NFAT protein .
However , the recent cloning and expression of NFAT genes has yielded valuable information about the proteins , and direct protein analyses should now be possible .
Towards that end , antibodies to NFAT will be important reagents to develop for probing protein structure and function .
In the studies reported here , we developed a peptide antibody to NFAT , and we used it to characterize NFAT , in cells .
We demonstrate directly in °°P labeling experiments that NFAT , is a phosphoprotein and that T cell activation results in NFAT , dephosphorylation that can be blocked by pretreatment with FK506 .
Furthermore , we show that dephosphorylation is accompanied by translocation of NFAT , protein from the cytosol to the nucleus of cells .

Expression of NFAT , , in mouse tissues and T cells .
Aliquots of mouse tissue homogenate or cell lysates were prepared , elec-trophoresed , transferred to nitrocellulose , and probed with the NFAT , antibody as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
The position of the molecular weight markers is as indicated .
A , 200 ug of mouse tissue homogenate from brain ( lane 1 ) , heart ( lane 2 ) , kidney ( lane 3 ) , liver { lane 4 ) , spleen ( Zane 5 ) , thymus ( Zane 6 ) , and 2.5 X 10° HT-2 cell equivalents as a control ( Zane 7 ) .
Lames 8 and 9 contain spleen and thymus , respectively , and the blot was developed using antibody containing a 100-fold excess of the antigen peptide .
B , 1 x 10° cell equivalents from J5D9 ( Zane 1 ) , HSB ( lane 2 ) , EL-4 ( lane 3 ) , peripheral blood lymphocytes ( Zane 4 ) , 2.5 X 10° cell equivalents from HT-2 cells ( Jane 5 ) , 1 X 10° cell equivalents from EL-4 cells ( Zane 6 ) , and 2.5 X 10° cell equivalents from HT-2 cells ( Zanes 7 and 8 ) .
Lanes 6 and 7 were developed with antibody in the presence of antigen peptide , and lane 8 was developed with second antibody alone .
for 5 min , and 1.5 X 10° cells were removed for the zero time point .
The remainder of the cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in normal growth medium in the presence or absence of 2 uM ionomycin .
At the indicated times , aliquots ( 1.5 X 10° cells ) were removed , lysed , and immunoprecipitated with the NFAT , antibody as described above .
The autorad was quantitated as described above .
[ *°S/Methionine Degradation-Cells were resuspended at 6 x 10° cells/ml in low methionine-containing medium plus ( 50 wCi/ml ) and incubated for 18 h. The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended at 3 X 10° cells/ml in normal growth medium containing Me , SO ( control ) , 2 uM ionomycin , or 100 nM FK506 plus 2 uM ionomycin .
Cells were pretreated with FK506 5 min prior to the addition of ionomycin .
Cells ( 1.5 X 10° ) were removed immediately ( zero time point ) or at the indicated times , and the lysates were immunoprecipitated as described above .
Autorads were quantitated as described above and analyzed by linear regression to determine the NFAT , half-life .
RESULTS A polyclonal antibody was developed against a peptide from the COOH-terminal domain of NFAT .
This peptide is outside the Rel homology domain and is from a unique region of NFAT , that is not present in NFAT , ( 7 ) .
Therefore , this antibody is a specific reagent for characterizing the NFAT , protein .
Western blot analysis was carried out in order to determine the expression of NFAT , in various mouse tissues ( Fig .
1A ) .
The highest level of NFAT , expression was observed in spleen and thymus tissue .
In thymus , the antibody strongly hybridized with proteins in the 110-130-kDa molecular mass range , NFAT , Dephosphorylation and Nuclear Localization suggesting protein heterogeneity , while in spleen tissue , reactivity was predominantly against a 110-kDa protein .
In both these tissues , reactivity with smaller proteins of 72 , 66 , and 59 kDa was observed .
It is unknown whether these proteins are proteolytic fragments of the larger NFAT , protein .
However , in competition experiments in which the NFAT , peptide was included in the antibody incubation , no reactivity was observed , indicating the specificity of the interactions ( Zanes 8 and 9 ) .
In kidney and liver , there was little or no antibody reactivity against proteins in the 120-kDa range .
Cross-reactivity against proteins of 66 and 72 kDa was shared among kidney , spleen , and thymus , although interestingly , in spleen and thymus , reactivity against the 66-kDa protein was predominant , while in kidney , antibody reactivity was greater against the 72-kDa protein , compared with the 66-kDa protein .
Expression of NFAT , was very low in brain , while in heart no NFAT , was detected .
The high level of NFAT , expression in spleen and thymus is consistent with previous reports demonstrating NFAT DNA binding activity in T cells .
Various T cell lines were profiled to investigate whether NFAT , levels differ among T cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
Peripheral blood lymphocytes had the lowest level of NFAT , expression ( Zane 4 ) .
These results could not simply be explained by a lack of reactivity of the murine peptide-derived antibody against human protein , since human T cell Jurkat cells showed significant reactivity with the antibody ( lane 1 ) .
HSB cells , a human T cell line , also expressed the approximately 140-kDa NFAT , ( Zane 2 ) .
In EL-4 cells , a mouse thy-moma cell line , NFAT , was expressed , but the protein was more heterogeneous , since proteins from 120 to 140 kDa reacted with the antibody ( Zane 3 ) .
HT-2 cells , an IL-2-dependent mouse T cell line , had the highest level of NFAT , expression compared with the other cell lines ( Zane 5 ) .
In the experiment shown in Fig .
1B , lysate from 2.5 X 10° HT-2 cells resulted in a comparable or greater signal , compared with the other cell lines , in which 4-fold more cell equivalents ( 1 X 10° ) were used .
In all of the cell lines , cross-reactivity with a 66-kDa protein was seen , suggesting , as in the tissue samples , that other NFAT , protein forms may be expressed .
Competition experiments using NFAT , peptide and EL-4 or HT-2 cell extracts ( lanes 6 and 7 ) demonstrated that all the reactivity could be competed by excess peptide .
No NFAT protein was detected in MOLT-4 cells , a human T cell leukemia line or in NIH 3T3 cell fibroblasts ( data not shown ) .
Activation of T cells by treatment with PMA and calcium ionophore stimulates NFAT DNA binding activity ( 2 ) .
The NFAT , antibody was used to investigate directly the effect of T cell activation on NFAT protein levels ( Fig .
24 ) .
For these and subsequent experiments , HT-2 cells were used , due to their high level of expression of NFAT , .
NFAT , migrated as an approximately 120-kDa protein in untreated cells .
Treatment of the cells with either ionomycin alone ( Zane 2 ) or the combination of PMA plus ionomycin ( data not shown ) , resulted in a decrease in the molecular weight of NFAT , suggestive of a proteolytic and/or dephosphorylation event .
Identical shifts in the NFAT , protein were observed when the cell treatments and lysate preparation were carried out in the presence of a panel of protease inhibitors , including leupeptin , phenyImethylsulfo-nyl fluoride , and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the mobility shift was not the result of proteolysis .
The predominant NFAT , protein band in the ionomycin-treated cells was approximately 110 kDa , although the protein was heterogenous in size .
Pretreatment of the cells with 500 nm FK506 blocked the ionomycin-induced shift in NFAT , ( Zane 3 ) , suggesting a role for CaN .
As a control , cells were pretreated with rapamycin prior to ionomycin treat 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog NFAT , Dephosphorylation and Nuclear Localization 0 & 5 §0g 8 .

Ionomycin treatment of HT-2 cells results in NFAT , dephosphorylation .
A and B , HT-2 cells were treated and lysates were prepared for Western blotting ( A ) , or NFAT , was immunoprecipitated from *°P-labeled cells ( B ) as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
Lane 1 , control ; lane 2 , 2 uM ionomycin for 10 min ; lane 3 , 500 nM FK506 pretreatment ( 1 h ) followed by 2 um ionomycin for 10 min ; lane 4 , 1 uM rapamycin pretreatment ( 1 h ) followed by ionomycin for 10 min .
ment .
Rapamycin binds to FKBP-12 , but unlike FK506 , it does not inhibit CaN , nor does it inhibit NFAT DNA binding activity .
Rapamycin pretreatment also did not block the NFAT , mobility shift induced by ionomycin ( Zane 4 ) .
To determine whether the changes in NFAT , mobility were the result of ionomycin-induced dephosphorylation , °°P labeling experiments were carried out ( Fig .
2B ) .
Cells were labeled with [ 32P ] orthophosphate for 4 h followed by treatments similar to those shown in Fig .
24 , and immunoprecipitation was carried out with the NFAT , antibody .
A similar decrease in molecular weight was observed in the °°P-labeled NFAT , following ionomycin treatment as was observed in the Western blot experiments .
Quantitation of the °°P autoradiograms showed that ionomycin treatment resulted in an approximately 65 % loss in °°P from NFAT , ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , ionomycin treatment never resulted in a complete loss of °°P from NFAT , indicating that complete dephosphorylation did not occur .
In addition , FK506 inhibited the loss of °°P , while rapamycin had no effect .
The results of these experiments demonstrate directly that the shift in molecular weight following ionomycin treatment was the result of NFAT , dephosphorylation and that FK506 pretreatment blocked the dephosphorylation .
A role for CaN in the ionomycin-stimulated dephosphorylation of NFAT , , was shown directly in immune complex assays ( Fig .
3 ) .
NFAT , was immunoprecipitated from untreated HT-2 cells , and the immunoprecipitates were washed and incubated with CaN .
CaN dephosphorylated NFAT , in vitro , as shown by a decrease in the NFAT , molecular weight , which was comparable to the molecular weight shift resulting from treatment of cells with ionomycin ( compare Zanes 2 and 3 ) .
CaN contains an autoinhibitory domain in its COOH-terminal domain , and a peptide from this region inhibits CaN dephosphorylation of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase peptide in vitro ( Ref .
22 and data not shown ) .
Addition of the autoinhibitory peptide to the immune complex assay blocked the dephosphorylation of NFAT , by CaN ( Zane 4 ) .
In contrast , treatment of the precipitated NFAT , with another serine/threonine phosphatase , PP2A , resulted in little or no dephosphorylation of NFAT , ( Zane 5 ) , although the enzyme readily dephosphorylated 4-methylumbelliferryl phosphate ( data not shown ) .
The tyrosine phosphatase PTP1 also did not dephosphorylate NFAT , ( lane 7 ) , suggesting that NFAT , may not contain phosphorylated tyrosine residues .
Consistent with this hypothesis was the observation that there was no reactivity on Western blots of an-tiphosphotyrosine antibodies with NFAT , ( Fig .
3B ) .

Immunocomplex phosphatase assay and phosphotyrosine blot .
A , immunocomplex phosphatase assay .
Immunoprecipitates from untreated cells ( Zane 1 ) and ionomycin-treated cells ( lane 2 ) are shown .
Immunoprecipitates were prepared from untreated cells as described under `` Experimental Procedures `` and incubated with the following : 50 nm CaN plus 200 nM calmodulin ( Zane 3 ) , 50 nm CaN , 200 nM calmodulin and 500 pM autoinhibitory peptide ( lane 4 ) , 0.1 units PP2a ( lane 5 ) , PP2a plus 500 nM okadaic acid ( lane 6 ) , PTP !
( lane 7 ) , and 50 nm CaN and 200 nM calmodulin ( Zane 8 ) , developed with second antibody alone .
The thick arrow points to the phosphorylated form of NFAT , and the thin arrow points to the dephosphorylated form .
B , phosphotyrosine blot .
Lane 1 , HT-2 cell lysate ; lane 2 , A431 cell lysate .
The ~170-kDa epidermal growth factor receptor is shown in lane 2 as a positive control for the phosphotyrosine antibody .
together , these results indicate that NFAT , readily serves as an in vitro substrate for CaN .
Previous studies demonstrated that activation of T cells is accompanied by an increase in nuclear NFAT DNA binding activity .
Using the NFAT , antibody , we showed directly the presence of the NFAT , protein in the nucleus of stimulated cells ( Fig .
44 ) .
In untreated cells , all of the NFAT , protein was detected in the low speed supernatant ( lane 1 ) .
Following a 10-min ionomycin treatment , however , the lower molecular weight , dephosphorylated form of NFAT , was predominantly localized to the nuclear fraction ( Zane 5 ) .
Pretreatment of cells with FK506 prior to ionomycin stimulation blocked the dephosphorylation , as previously observed , and also blocked the translocation of NFATp to the nucleus ( compare lanes 3 and 6 ) .
The time course for NFAT , dephosphorylation and nuclear localization was examined in more detail ( Fig .
4B ) .
Fractionation of cells immediately following the addition of ionomycin indicated that NFAT , dephosphorylation was rapid ( lane 4 ) , as shown by the ladder of protein bands .
After ionomycin treatment for 10 min , the dephosphorylated NFAT , was present in both the low speed supernatant and the nuclear fractions ( lane 5 ) , suggesting that NFAT , is dephosphorylated in the cytosol , followed by localization of the dephosphorylated form to the nucleus .
With increasing time of incubation with ionomycin , dephosphorylated NFAT , was present almost exclusively in the nuclear fraction , although a small level of dephosphorylated NFAT , was detected in the supernatant throughout the 4-h time course .
These results suggest that NFAT , is rapidly dephosphorylated and localized to the nucleus following ionomycin treatment and that the dephosphorylated NFAT , remains in the nucleus in the continuing presence of ionomycin .
A similar localization experiment was carried out with cells pretreated with ionomycin , followed by removal of the ionomycin ( Fig .
4C ) .
At the start of the experiment , following a 10 min treatment with ionomycin , essentially all of the NFAT , was localized to the nucleus , and the nuclear NFAT , was in the 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 22606 o o < & _ £ _ 2 S $ $ € § g B f : ® A 80 S E S8 s # - as _ ® cie Syms a 1 2 3 4 5° 6 low speed supernatant B nuclear lysate __ | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 low speed supernatant C [ 1 wore 0 cam ._ « o « o « » am t nuclear lysate cme 0 0 * ﬂ unul .

NFAT , is localized to the nucleus in ionomycin-treated cells .

B , extended ionomycin time course ; C , ionomycin washout time course .
For the experiment shown in panel B , cells were stimulated with 2 pM ionomycin , and the zero time aliquot ( 1 x 10° cells ) was removed immediately after the addition of ionomycin .
For the experiment shown in panel C , cells were stimulated with 2 uM ionomycin for 10 min .
The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended at 2 10° cells/ml in normal growth medium , and an aliquot ( 1 X 10° cells ) was removed immediately for the zero time point .
Lanes 1 and 2 contain lysate prepared from 2.5 X 10° cells from untreated or ionomycin-treated cells , respectively , as controls .
Supernatant ( upper part ) and nuclei ( Zower part ) are shown from untreated cells ( Zane 3 ) and cells treated with ionomycin for the indicated times : 0 time ( Zame 4 ) , 10 min ( lane 5 ) , 30 min ( lane 6 ) , 1 h ( lane 7 ) , 2 h ( lane 8 ) , 3 h ( lane 9 ) , and 4 h { lane 10 ) .
lower molecular weight , dephosphorylated form .
After 10 min following washout of the ionomycin , NFAT , was still in the nuclear fraction , although a low level of the higher molecular weight , phosphorylated form of NFAT , was detected in the low speed supernatant .
However , at the 30-min time point and beyond , NFAT , was localized in the low speed supernatant fraction , with no detectable NFAT , in the nucleus .
These results suggest that following ionomycin washout , NFAT , is recycled from the nucleus back into the cytosol .
Furthermore , the NFAT , in the low speed supernatant was exclusively in the higher molecular weight , phosphorylated form , suggesting that migration from the nucleus was accompanied by rapid rephos-phorylation of NFAT .
Loss of NFAT , from the nuclear fraction could result from NFAT , degradation .

onine labeling experiments were carried out to measure the half-life of the NFAT , protein .
Cells were labeled overnight with [ °°SJmethionine and then chased in medium containing unlabeled methionine .
The rate of loss of immunoprecipitated NFAT , was determined for untreated , ionomycin-treated , and FK506- and ionomycin-treated cells , and is shown as a semi-log plot ( Fig .
5A ) .
In untreated cells the ¢ , for NFAT , was 16.9 + 0.86 h ( mean + S.E .
, n = 3 ) , which was similar to the value obtained from cells treated with the combination of FK506 and ionomycin ( 19.2 + 3.9 h ) .
Treatment with ionomycin , however , caused a slight decrease in the time required for loss of 50 % of the prelabeled NFAT , to 11.9 + 2.7 h. These results indicate that the loss of NFAT , from the nucleus was not the result of degradation of the protein and support the hypothesis that nuclear NFAT , reappears in the cytosol following ionomycin removal .
During short labeling times , the major NFAT , was in the dephosphorylated form ( Fig .
5B ) .
However , this form was rapidly chased into the higher molecular weight , phosphorylated form of NFAT , suggesting that phosphorylation of NFAT , occurs very rapidly following synthesis .
DISCUSSION Much of the available information concerning NFAT is the result of studies of NFAT DNA binding activity ( 1-3 , 9 , 11 ) .
More recently , several forms of NFAT have been cloned , and Northern analysis demonstrated that NFAT mRNA levels vary among different tissues and under stimulus conditions ( 7 ) .
Investigations with a specific NFAT , antibody allowed expansion of these studies to include direct analysis of the NFAT , protein .
The peptide sequence used to generate the antibody described here is derived from the COOH-terminal region of NFAT , which is not present in NFAT , and thus the antibody 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog NFAT , Dephosphorylation and Nuclear Localization differentiates between the two NFAT forms .
The NFAT , protein was highly expressed in thymus and spleen tissue , which is consistent with mRNA analysis ( 7 ) .
However , Northrup et al .
( 7 ) reported that NFAT , mRNA levels were similar in brain , heart , thymus , and spleen , while our immunoblotting results ( Fig .
1 ) showed that no NFAT , protein was detected in heart tissue , and only very low levels in brain .
These results suggest that the presence of NFAT , mRNA may not predict the expression of the protein in all tissues or cells .
In addition , lower molecular weight proteins reacted with the NFAT , antibody , suggesting that other forms of NFAT , may exist .
Consistent with these results is the report that COOH-terminal splicing variants of NFATp have been cloned ( 2 ) .
Peptide mapping or purification of the lower molecular weight , cross-reactive proteins is required to determine whether they are related to NFAT .
Tonomycin treatment of the HT-2 cells resulted in a significant shift in the molecular weight of NFAT , , as shown by immunoblotting analysis .
The °°P labeling experiments provided a direct demonstration that NFAT , is a phosphoprotein and that the shift in molecular weight resulted from dephosphorylation of NFAT .
The dephosphorylation-induced molecular weight mass was approximately 10 kDa and represented an approximately 65 % loss in phosphate from the protein .
The extent of phosphorylation of NFAT , is not known , and the results shown here indicate that dephosphorylation results in a significant change in the mobility of the protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels .
This result has practical applications , for it allows detection of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of NFAT , using Western blot analysis .
The results of the localization experiments suggest that the phosphorylation state of NFAT , may be a determinant of its localization within the cell .
In untreated cells , NFAT , was in the phosphorylated state , and was localized to the low speed supernatant .
However , in ionomycin-treated cells , dephosphorylated NFAT , was found in the nuclear fraction .
Kinetic anal-ysis , shown in Fig .
4 , suggests that dephosphorylation occurs prior to nuclear localization , since at the 10-min time point , dephosphorylated NFAT , was present in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions , while at later time points the dephosphorylated form was exclusively localized to the nucleus .
As long as ionomycin was present , NFAT , remained both dephosphorylated and in the nucleus .
Previous studies demonstrated that NFAT , DNA binding activity is localized to the cytosol of untreated T cells , and to the nuclear fraction in stimulated cells ( 3 ) .
The results shown here demonstrate directly that the shift in DNA binding activity seen by others reflects a change in the cellular location of the NFAT , protein .
Following ionomycin removal , NFAT , reappeared in the cell supernatant fraction , in the higher molecular weight , phosphorylated form .
The labeling experiments demonstrated that NFAT , is a relatively stable protein , with a half-life of approximately 17 h in untreated cells and approximately 12 h in ionomycin-treated cells .
Thus , the loss of signal from the nucleus following ionomycin removal can not be explained by degradation of NFAT , .
These results suggest that NFAT , may shuttle in and out of the nucleus , depending on the activation state of the cell as well as the phosphorylation state of the protein .
A potential nuclear localization sequence has been identified within the Rel homology region of NFAT , ( 23 ) .
There are a number of potential phosphorylation sites in NFAT , including one within the nuclear localization sequence .
One possibility is that activation-induced dephosphorylation of NFAT , results in an unmasking of the nuclear localization sequence , leading to nuclear localization of the protein .
The immunocomplex assay demonstrated directly that 22607 NFAT , is a CaN substrate in vitro .
Furthermore , the CaN-induced molecular weight shift in NFAT , was similar to that resulting from ionomycin treatment of cells .
Treatment of intact cells with FK506 , a CaN inhibitor , blocks the ionomycin-induced dephosphorylation , which further supports but does not prove the hypothesis that NFAT , is a CaN substrate in intact cells .
In general , no consensus sequence for dephosphorylation of substrates by CaN has been identified .
However , Donella-Deana et al .
( 24 ) have demonstrated in phosphopeptide studies that basic residues on the NH-terminal side of the phos-phoamino acid , especially at the -3 position , are positive determinants for dephosphorylation by CaN , while acidic residues on the COOH-terminal side are negative determinants .
Because of a lack of a strong consensus sequence , these results and the results of others ( 25 , 26 ) have led to the suggestion that more complex protein structural determinants also play a role in defining CaN substrate specificity .
Taken together , these results suggest that a number of sites within NFAT , may be sites for CaN dephosphorylation .
Mapping these sites in vitro and comparing them with the sites of dephosphorylation in intact cells is required to establish whether NFAT , is a direct substrate for CaN in intact cells .
The results of such experiments will define in more detail the exact role of CaN in T cell activation .
