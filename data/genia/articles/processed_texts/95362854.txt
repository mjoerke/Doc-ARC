Interleukin 4 Activates a Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription ( Stat ) Protein which Interacts with an Interferon-y Activation Site-like Sequence Upstream of the I , Exon in a Human B Cell Line Evidence for the Involvement of Janus Kinase 3 and Interleukin-4 Stat Xu Fenghao , * Andrew Saxon , ** Andrew Nguyen , * Zhang Ke , * David Diaz-Sanchez , * and André Nel** *The Hart and Louise Lyon Laboratory , Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy , Department of Medicine , *The Molecular Biology Institute , and 'The Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center , UCLA School of Medicine , University of California , Los Angeles , California 90024-1680 Abstract Germ line C. transcripts can be induced by IL-4 in the human B cell line , BL-2 .
Utilizing a IFN-y activation site-like DNA sequence element located upstream of the I , exon , we demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays that IL-4 induced a binding activity in the cytosol and nucleus of BL-2 cells .
This factor was designated IL-4 NAF ( IL-4-induced nuclear-activating factors ) and was identified as a tyrosine phosphoprotein , which translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus upon IL-4 treatment .
Because these are the characteristics of a signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) protein , we determined whether antibodies to Stat proteins will interfere with gel mobility shift and found that antibodies to IL-4 Stat , also known as Stat6 , but not antibodies to other Stat proteins , interfere with the formation of the IL-4 NAF complex .
Congruous with the involvement of a Stat protein , IL-4 induced robust Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) activity in BL-2 cells .
Cotransfection of JAK3 with IL-4 Stat into COS-7 cells produced an intracellular activity which bound the same IFN-y activation site-like sequence and comigrated with IL-4 NAF in electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
These results show that IL-4 NAF is IL-4 Stat , which is activated by JAK3 in response to IL-4 receptor engage-ment .

While induction of proliferation appears to involve the phosphorylation of the substrate , 4PS/IRS-1 , and recruitment of the second messengers phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI-3 kinase ) and Grb2 , not much is known about the pathways by which IL-4 directs cellular differentiation ( 6-9 ) .
IgE isotype switching involves the sequential steps of germline transcription followed by heavy chain gene rearrangement ( 4 , 5 , 10 ) .
IL-4 induces germline transcription ( 4 , 5 , 10 ) , while IFN-y inhibits the process ( 11 ) .
To examine if IFN-y and IL4 have either antagonistic or analogous effects on transcription , an IL-4 induced DNA binding factor which reacts with an IFN-y response element ( also known as an IFN-y activation site or GAS ' ) , was demonstrated to be present by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) in the human monocytic cell line , Thp-1 ( 12 ) .
This factor , which interacts with an upstream sequence in the FcyR , gene , was named IL-4-induced nuclear-activating factor ( IL-4 NAF ) ( see Fig .
1 A ; 12 ) .
A homologous 9-bp sequence in the promoter of the CD23 gene was described by Kohler and Rieber and designated IL-4 nuclear-activated factor ( see Fig .
1 A ; 13 ) .
In murine B cells , an IL-4-inducible factor which interacts with the initiation site of the germline I , exon , was designated signal-transducing factor of IL-4 ( STF-IL4 ) by Schindler et al .
( 14 ) .
Utilizing the Fc .
, R , probe to purify an interactive Thp-1 cell protein , Hou et al .
have recently cloned an IL-4-induced DNA binding factor which they designated the signal transducer and activator of transcription by IL-4 ( IL-4 Stat ) ( 15 ) .
Stat proteins are a novel family of transcription factors which , after phosphorylation and homo- or heterodimeri-zation in the cytosol , shuttle to the nucleus where they interact with select promoter sequences ( 16 , 17 ) .
Although not proven , it is likely that IL-4 NAF represents a homo- or heterodimerized version of IL-4 Stat .
In addition to IL-4 Stat , several of the Stat genes have now been cloned , including } ( p91/p84 ) , Stat2 ( p113 ) , Stat3 ( p89 , acute phase response factor , APRF ) , Stat4 ( p88 ) , and Stats ( p90 , mammary gland factor , MGF ) ( 18-21 ) .
It would appear as if the connection between Stat proteins and a variety of activating receptors is based on the use of a novel family of tyrosine protein kinases also known as Janus kinase ( JAK ) ( 16 , 17 ) .
Moreover , there appears to be selectivity in the use of JAK 's and Stat proteins by specific receptors .
For instance , IFN-a utilizes JAK1 and Tyk2 to activate Statl and 1 .

Interleukin 4 Activates a Stat Protein which Interacts with the I , Promoter 907 Stat2 , while IFN-y utilizes JAK1 and JAK2 to activate Statl ( 16 , 17 , 22 ) .
Recently , it was reported that IL-2 and IL-4 activate JAK3 in human T lymphocytes and NK cells ( 23 , 24 ) ; the homologous use of JAK3 by these two cytokine receptors is attributed to their sharing of a common y ( Cy ) subunit ( 25 ) .
Moreover , it appears as if JAK3 interacts directly with Cy and that JAK3 plays a role in signaling by the IL-4 receptor ( 26 , 27 ) .
Taken together with the fact that IL-4 NAF and STF-IL-4 are known to be tyrosine phosphoproteins , it is possible that they are JAK3 substrates ( 12 , 14 ) .
We chose a GAS-like element upstream of the human I , exon as an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) probe to demonstrate induction of a binding factor , designated IL-4 NAF , in a human B cell line which undergoes germline C , transcription .
This protein is a tyrosine phosphoprotein which translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus , and which comigrates during EMSA with IL-4 Stat which has been activated in COS-7 cells by cotransfection of JAK3 .

Whole cell extracts were prepared as described above .
Results BL-2 cells contain an IL-4-inducible factor which binds to a GAS sequence which appears upstream of the I , exon .
BL-2 cells were treated with IL-4 for time periods ranging between 1 and 15 min , and cellular extracts were assayed by EMSA utilizing a *P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to base pairs -153 to -138 ( S1 oligonucleotide ) of the human I , promoter ( Fig .

This sequence is homologous to the 9-bp palindromic motif of the Fc , R , promoter ( Fig .

No shift complex was seen during treatment with PMA ( Fig .

The IL-4-induced complex was competed with excess unlabeled S1 oligonucleotide , but not unlabeled S2 oligonucleotide , which corresponds to the region immediately adjacent to S1 ( base pairs -174 to -152 ) ( Fig .

While another GAS sequence , the IL-6 responsive APRE ( Fig .

5 x 10° BL-2 cells were precultured with varying amount genistein for 2 h at 37°C before stimulation with 20 ng/ml IL-4 for 10 min at 37°C .
Control cultures were stimulated with IL-4 without prior genistein exposure .
Whole cell extracts were used for conducting EMSA .
In some vials , 10 ug of extract was preincubated with 1 ug 4G10 ( antiphosphotyrosine ) , or 1 ug OKT -3 ( isotype control ) , before addition of the probe .
In another set of vials 10 ug of extract was incubated with 1 ug PTP-1C , a tyrosine phosphatase , for 30 min at 30°C in absence or presence of 1 uM Na ; VO , , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , or 10 uM NaF , a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor .

lation based on the following observations .
First , the protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) inhibitor , genistein , interfered with induction of IL-4 NAF in BL-2 cells in a dose-dependent fashion ( Fig .
2 A ) .
Similar observations were made with a second PTK inhibitor , erbstatin .
Second , we demonstrated that IL-4 NAF is a tyrosine phosphoprotein as determined by prevention of a shift complex when cell lysates were prior incubated with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies ( Fig .
2 B , lane 3 ) .
In contrast to supershift induced during EMSA with 4610 , no shift was seen with an unrelated monoclonal antibody ( OKT3 ) of the same isotype ( Fig .
2 B , lane 4 ) .
Third , we showed that the phospho-tyrosyl residues on IL-4 NAF are required for DNA binding by , determining the effect of a protein tyrosine phosphatase , PTP-1C on already activated IL-4 NAF : PTP-1C abrogated the formation of a shift complex when nuclear extracts were exposed to this enzyme before conducting EMSA ( Fig .
2 C , lane 3 ) .
To insure that the loss of DNA binding was a result of the action of the tyrosine phosphatase , we included sodium orthovanadate , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , and NaF , a serine threonine phosphatase inhibitor , with the reactions .
While sodium orthovanadate negated the effect of PTP-1C on IL-4 NAF binding , NaF did not exert any effect ( Fig .
2 C , lanes 4-6 ) .
Since IL-4 NAF is a tyrosine phosphoprotein which interacts with a GAS sequence , this raised the possibility that this factor belongs to the Stat protein family .
These factors are phosphoproteins which bind with varying affinity to a series of GAS 910 Fenghao et al .
like elements and are known to communicate information from several cytokine receptors to the nucleus after homo- or hetero-dimerization in the cytosol ( 16 ) .
To test if similar translocation can be demonstrated in BL-2 cells , nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared for analysis by EMSA .
The results , which are depicted in Fig .
3 , show that while IL-4 NAF activity was rapidly induced in both the cytosol and the nucleus , the increase in cytosolic activity ( 1 min ) preceded the major increase in nuclear activity ( 2 min ) ( Fig .
3 ) .
This latency is compatible with activation in the cytosol , followed by translocation to the nucleus .
IL-4 induces robust tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 in BL-2 cells .
The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat proteins requires the participation of a family of PTK 's , namely the JAK 's ( 17 ) .
It would appear as if select cytokine receptors use specific combinations of JAK `` s to activate one or more Stat proteins ( 16 , 17 ) .
It has recently been shown that the IL-4 receptor in T lymphocytes and NK cells activate JAK3 ( 23 , 24 ) .
BL-2 cells were treated with IL-4 for various lengths of time , and immunoprecipitation performed for JAK1 and JAK3 .
These complexes were analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine immu-noblotting .
While IL-4 induced relatively weak tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 in BL-2 cells ( Fig .
4 A , lanes 2-6 ) , there was a robust activation of JAK3 ( Fig .
4 B , lanes 2-6 ) .
IL-4-induced JAK3 phosphorylation was suppressed by genistein at doses > 25 uM , which is in agreement with the effect of this Cytosol Nucleus I U I Time ( min ) : 0 .

Taken together with the data in Figs .
2 and 3 , the findings in Fig .
4 strongly suggest that IL-4 NAF is a Stat protein which operates downstream of JAK3 in BL-2 cells .
During conducting of EMSA , antisera to Stat !
( Fig .
5 ) , Stat2 ( not shown ) , and Stat3 ( Fig .
5 ) failed to block the shift of the IL-4 NAF complex . '
A rabbit antiserum to Stat6 did , however , block the formation of this DNA-protein complex as shown in Fig .
5 ( lane 3 ) .
Moreover , antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from BL-2 cells , showed induction of 100- and 130-kD phosphoproteins by IL-4 on antiphosphotyrosine overlay ( Fig .
6 ) .
While p130 likely represents activated JAK3 , p100 is the exact molecular weight of IL-4 Stat , also known as Stat6 .
Transfection of JAK3 and IL-4 Stat into COS-7 cells induces a DNA binding activity which coelectrophoreses with IL-4 NAF .
To establish that JAK3 can activate IL-4 NAF , we attempted overexpression of JAK3 in BL-2 cells without success .
We did succeed , however , in transfecting COS-7 cells with JAK3 and could demonstrate that the transfected kinase is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated ( not shown ) .
On cotransfecting JAK3 _ with IL-4 Stat , we were able to show by EMSA that an S1 oligonucleotide binding activity is generated in the cytosol of COS-7 cells ( Fig .
7 , lane 6 ) .
Moreover , this shift complex comigrated with IL-4 NAF from BL-2 cells ( Fig .
7 , lanes / and 2 ) .
No shift complexes were induced in COS-7 cells transfected with empty vector , JAK3 cDNA or IL-4 Stat cDNA only ( Fig .

These results strongly suggest , that IL-4 Stat is activated by JAK3 , whereupon this transcription factor binds to the same site as IL-4 NAF .
Discussion In this paper we show that IL-4 induces a tyrosine phosphoprotein , IL-4 NAF , which interacts with a GAS sequence upstream of the human I , exon .
IL-4 NAF activity increases in the cytosol before appearing in the nucleus , which is compatible with cyto-sol-to-nuclear translocation .

Activated IL-4 Stat and IL-4 NAF comigrated .
Lane : 1 2 3 4 5 6 a novel member of the Stat family which recognizes the same GAS after activation by JAK3 in a cotransfected COS-7 cell line .
Our study shows that the IL-4 response element in human I , promoter is homologous to the response element characterized by Kohler and Rieber ( 13 ) , Kotanides and Reich ( 12 ) , and Schindler et al .
( 14 ) .
Kohler and Rieber identified the so-called NF-IL4 which interacts with a 9-bp motif ( 5'-TTCTAAGAA-3 ' ) in the human CD23b gene promoter ( 13 ; Fig .
1 A ) .
Kotanides and Reich described induction of IL-4 NAF in a human monocytic cell line , Thp-1 , which recognizes a GAS in the promoter of the human Fce , R , gene ( 12 ; Fig .
1 A ) .
This finding is compatible with the ability of Stat proteins to display varying affinity for a series of GAS-like elements ( 16 , 17 ) .
It is interesting that the IL-6-induced GAS response element in the promoter of the a ; -macroglobulin gene ( 32 ) competes for binding of IL-4 NAF to the S1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
1 B ) .
IL-6 failed , however , to induce a mobility shift complex with the S1 oligonucleotide .
The IL-4 NAF motif contains an inverted GAA repeat on opposite strands ( 12 ) , similar to other IL-4 response elements in the Fc.Ry , ( 34 ) , human Fc.Rp , ( 35 ) , murine C,1 ( 36 ) , murine C , ( 37 ) , murine MHCIIE/ # ( 38 ) , human MHCII-DRa ( 38 ) , and human Fc , R , genes ( 38 ) ( Fig .
1 A ) .
Schindler et al .
identified the so-called signal transducing factor for IL-4 ( STF-IL4 ) which interacts with a GAS sequence in the IRF-1 gene promoter as well as an upstream element ( R1/R2 se-quence ) in the murine I. promoter ( 14 ) .
Interestingly , the R1/ R2 nucleotide does not contain the inverted GAA repeat .
IL-4 NAF requires to be phosphorylated on tyrosine resi-due ( s ) to bind to the S1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2 B ) .
Both the in vitro removal of phosphate groups from tyrosine residues ( Fig .
2 C ) as well as the in vivo interference with tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
2 A ) abrogated IL-4 NAF activity .
These characteristics , together with the feature that IL-4 NAF is activated in both the cytosol and nucleus ( Fig .
3 ) , strongly suggested to us that IL-4 NAF is a Stat protein ( 16 , 17 ) .
Moreover , the delay by which nuclear activity is induced with respect to the cytosolic increase suggests intracellular translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus , which is another characteristic of Stat proteins ( Fig .
3 ) .
Antibodies to Statl , Stat2 , and Stat3 failed to bind to IL-4 NAF ( Fig .
5 ) .
Utilizing the identical GAS sequence which was used for identifying IL-4 NAF , Hou et al .
recently purified and cloned the gene of a new Stat protein , which was designated IL-4 Stat , also known as Stat6 ( 15 ) .
Utilizing an antiserum to Stat6 , we were able to show that the IL-4 NAF complex could be supershifted/blocked , proving that IL-4 NAF = IL-4 Stat = Stat6 ( Fig .
5 ) .
Moreover , we demonstrated IL-4-induced phosphorylation of a 100-kD protein in BL-2 cells , which is the identical molecular weight of IL-4 Stat ( Fig .
6 ) .
Stat protein activation involves the JAK family , which currently consists of four members , JAK1 , JAK2 , JAK3 , and Tyk2 ( 16 , 17 ) .
It would appear as if differential association of one or more of these kinases with the activating receptor may determine which Stat proteins are activated .
For instance , Stat1 activation by IFN-y requires both JAK1 and JAK2 to activate Stat1 , while Statl and Stat3 activation by the IL-6 receptor requires JAK1 , JAK2 , and Tyk2 ( 16 , 17 ) .
Recently it was shown that IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , and IL-9 activate JAK3 , and that this ability is dependent on their sharing of a common signaling subunit , C , , which is physically complexed to JAK3 ( 23-27 ) .
Moreover , IL-4 has been shown to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 in T cells and NK cells ( 23 , 24 ) .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK 's is indicative of their activation .
Simi-larly , in BL-2 cells we found robust induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 by IL-4 in association with weak JAK1 phosphorylation ( Fig .
4 ) .
It is possible that JAK1 associates with the ligand-binding 140-kD subunit of the IL-4 receptor and contribute to the activation of JAK3 when the former binds to C , .
Altogether , these findings suggest that JAK3 is the PTK which is directly involved in activation of IL-4 NAF .
To prove this notion more directly , we initially attempted to overexpress JAK3 in BL-2 cells , but did not succeed .
As an alternative , we cotransfected JAK3 and IL-4 Stat cDNA constructs into COS-7 cells .
This has resulted in activation of a cellular protein which bound the S1 oligonucleotide sequence ( Fig .
7 ) .
Moreover , this complex comigrates with IL-4 NAF ( Fig .
7 ) .
Because this complex was absent from cells which were transfected by JAK3 or IL-4 Stat only , it is reasonable to assume that JAK3 actually modified the cotransfected IL-4 Stat protein .
The exact molecular details of the interaction between the kinase and the Stat protein and the involvement of the IL-4 receptor needs to be further studied .
Insofar as germline C , transcription is important in the subsequent event of IgE gene rearrangement , it is likely that Stat6 plays a role in IgE production in B lymphocytes .
Whether binding of IL-4 NAF to the I. upstream site actually leads to transcriptional activation is unclear .
Mutational alteration of critical base pairs in the 9-bp palindromic motif of the CD23 promoter disrupted IL-4-induced activation of a luciferase reporter gene construct ( 13 ) .
When the sequence upstream of the I , promoter shown in Fig .
1 A was linked to a luciferase reporter gene and transfected into BL-2 cells , we found that IL-4 alone induced weak ( twofold ) stimulation of luciferase activity ( not shown ) .
This is in agreement with the relatively weak activation of a related luciferase construct transfected into DG75 and BL-2 cells by Albrecht et al .
( 39 ) .
In the presence of anti-CD40 antibodies , however , we found that IL-4 stimulated a definitive increase ( eightfold ) in luciferase activity in transiently transfected BL-2 cells ( not shown ) .
CD40 is known to deliver a signal which synergizes with the IL-4 activation pathway in human B lymphocytes undergoing C , .
rearrangement ( 40 , 41 ) .
CD40 ligation failed , however , to activate IL-4 NAF and did not exert additional effects on IL-4 NAF activation by IL-4 ( not shown ) .
The exact role of IL-4 NAF on germline transcription needs to be studied further .
