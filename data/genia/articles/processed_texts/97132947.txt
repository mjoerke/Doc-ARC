Engagement of the Lewis X Antigen ( CD15 ) Results in Monocyte Activation By Siu K. Lo , Douglas T. Golenbock , Philip M. Sass , Azmat Maskati , Hong Xu , and Roy L. Silverstein We previously reported that monocyte adhesion to tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) -treated endothelial cells increased expression of tissue factor and CD36 on monocytes .
Using immunological cross-linking to mimic receptor engagement by natural ligands , we now show that CD15 ( Lewis X ) , a monocyte counter-receptor for endothelial selectins may participate in this response .
We used cytokine production as a readout for monocyte activation and found that CD15 cross-linking induced TNF-a release from peripheral blood monocytes and cells from the monocytic cell line MM6 .
Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) showed an increase in steady-state TNF-a mRNA after 3 to 4 hours of cross-linking .
CD15 cross-linking also concomitantly increased interleukin-1B ( IL-1B ) mRNA , while no apparent change was observed in the levels of B-actin mRNA , indicating specificity .
To examine transcriptional regulation of cytokine genes by CD15 engage EVERAL STUDIES HAVE suggested a role for monocyte adhesion molecules in amplifying cellular signaling and thus enhancing monocyte activation .
Engagement of CD11/CD18 integrins , for example , has been shown to enhance endotoxin-induced monocyte activation . ``
We have recently reported that monocyte adhesion to cytokine-activated endothelial cells induced tissue factor ( TF ) and CD36 expression on the monocyte surface and that engagement of endothelial cell E-selectin with monocyte counter-receptors , such as CD15 ( Lewis X ) , was necessary for the response . ``
'' Weyrich et al `` have shown that monocyte adhesion to P-selectin also induced cell activation as manifested by increased secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF- @ ) , although concomitant stimulation with platelet-activating factor was required .
Recognition of endothelial selectins by leukocytes requires cell surface expression of specific fucosylated carbohydrate structures . ``
'' These include Lewis X ( CD15 ) , sialylated Lewis X ( sCD15 ) , and dimeric sialylated Lewis X ( dsCD15 ) . ``
'' CD15 and related carbohydrates are found on numerous cellular proteins involved in cellular adhesive events and have a broad cellular distribution including leuko-cytes `` and tumor cells . ``
Most of the CD15-related antigens are present on either glycoproteins or glycolipids .
On neutrophils , CD15 is associated with several proteins of various molecular weights in the range of 105 and 165 kD . ``
Although immunopreciptation studies indicate that CD15 is present on CD11/CD18 integrins , '* `` `` leukocytes from patients genetically deficient in CD11/CD18 ( Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency ) also bear CD15 . ``
Using microsequence and mass spectrometry , Mahrenholz et al `` `` recently established that CD15 is also associated with a member of the carci-noembryonic antigen-related family of cell adhesion mole-cules .
The exact identity of the proteins and lipid moieties bearing the CD15 antigen that are involved in leukocyte adhesion and signaling is not known . ``
'' Recently putative glycoprotein ligands for P-selectin ( designated PSGL-1 ) and E-selectin ( designated ESL-1 ) have been identified on human and mouse leukocytes , respectively . ``
Immunological and cDNA transfection studies strongly suggest that these may be the major leukocyte counter-recep- Blood , Vol 89 , No 1 ( January 1 ) , 1997 ; pp 307-314 ment , a CAT plasmid reporter construct containing IL-1§ promoter/enhancer sequences was introduced into MMG .
Subsequent cross-linking of CD15 increased CAT activity .
CD15 engagement by monoclonal antibody also attenuated IL-18 transcript degradation , demonstrating that signaling via CD15 also had posttranscriptional effects .
Nuclear extracts of anti-CD15 cross-linked cells demonstrated enhanced levels of the transcriptional factor activator protein-1 , minimally changed nuclear factor- « B , and did not affect SV40 promoter specific protein-1 .
We conclude that engagement of CD15 on monocytes results in monocyte activation .
In addition to its well-recognized adhesive role , CD15 may function as an important signaling molecule capable of initiating proinflammatory events in monocytes that come into contact with activated endothelium .

tors for P- and E-selectin , and that recognition requires expression of the glycoprotein ligand and the fucosylated carbohydrate ( generated by expression of a specific fucosyl transferase ) . ``
Several studies have suggested that CD15 containing structures may mediate cell activation in neutrophils .
'* `` `` Anti-CD15 antibodies inhibited the oxidative burst in neutrophils induced by zymosan particles and inhibited phagocyto-sis of IgG- and C-opsonized particles and bacteria .
'* Furthermore , antibodies to CD15 have been shown to induce a transient increase in CD11/CD18 binding activity in neutro-phils . ``
In a recent study , we showed that anti-CD15 antibodies inhibited neutrophil recruitment in vivo and prevented the neutrophil-dependent pulmonary vascular injury . ``
'' In contrast to these reported studies of the function of CD15 expressed by neutrophils , the role of CD15 has not been elucidated on mononuclear phagocytes .
Monocyte adhesion to cytokine-activated endothelial cells is presumed to be an important early event in the development of proinflammatory lesions and atherosclerosis .

308 induced a phenotypic change in the adherent monocytes resulting in an increase in the surface expression of tissue factor procoagulant and CD36 ( a receptor for thrombospon-din and oxidized light density lipoprotein ) . ``
'' Engagement of E-selectin with its counter-receptor ( s ) was a critical part of this phenotypic transformation .
We thus hypothesize that engagement of CD15 may , at least in part , mediate monocyte activation .
To test this hypothesis , we have used an immunological cross-linking approach to mimic the engagement of CD15 during monocyte attachment to activated endothelium .
We found that cross-linking of CD15 resulted in the rapid activation of monocytes as evidenced by translocation of transcriptional factors such as activator protein-l1 ( AP-1 ) , increased cytokine generation , and upregulation of interleu-kin-183 gene promoter activity .
These data suggest that engagement of CD15 by its natural ligands may result in the activation of a variety of macrophage responses and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation and vascular disorders .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents .
- RPMI-1640 and M199 were obtained from BioWhit-aker ( Walkersville , MD ) .
Hanks ' balanced salt solution , Dulbecco 's phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , trypsin-EDTA , L-glutamine , and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from GIBCO ( Grand Island , NY ) .
Fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) was purchased from GIBCO containing < 1 ng/mL of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
LPS ( Escherichia Coli , 15 ) was purchased from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) .
All reagents were checked for the presence of endotoxin by a sensitive Limulus amebocyte lysate assay ( BioWhittaker ) , and found to have < 20 pg/mL .
Human platelet-poor plasma was prepared from healthy donors .
Phosphoinositol specific phospholipase C ( PI-PLC ) was purchased from Sigma ( St Louis , MO ) .
All other chemicals were of reagent grade .
Monocytic cells .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from freshly drawn blood by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation . ``
Typically , cell viability exceeded 98 % as assessed by Trypan blue exclusion .
In some experiments , monocytes were depleted from peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes by adhesion to plastic tissue cultured dishes ( Falcon , Frankin Lakes , NJ ) for 60 minutes at 37°C .
This process was repeated three times , and nonadherent lymphocytes were then harvested by washing with RPMI 1640 medium .
For studies requiring large numbers of cells ( eg , mRNA levels , mRNA degradation , and electromobility gel shift studies ) , we used a human monocyte-like cell line , Mono Mac 6 ( MM6 ) provided by Dr HW.L .
Ziegler-Heitbrock ( Institut fur Im-munologie , Universitat Munchen ) .
Pilot studies were performed to verify that these cells behaved similarly to freshly isolated monocytes in terms of cytokine and tissue factor production in response to CD15 cross-linking .
These cells have been extensively characterized and shown to exhibit morphological , biochemical , and physiological features of mature monocytes , `` including the expression of CD14 and CD15 as assessed by flow cytometry ( data not shown ) .
Antibodies .
Purified murine anti-CD15 IgM monoclonal antibodies ( MoAbs ) 80H5 and UN-172 were obtained from the Fifth Workshop and Conference on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens `` and PM81 from Medarex ( West Lebanon , NH ) .
Murine IgM VIM2 against CD65 ( dimeric sialyl-CD15 ) was a generous gift of Dr W. Knapp ( Kaumberg , Austria ) .
Hybridomas of additional control IgM MoAb 1B2 ( against Type II lactosamine chains ) and CSLEX1 ( against sialyl-CD15 ) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Rockville , MD ) .
Ascities of these MoAbs were prepared in mice using a standard protocol and IgM LO ET AL subsequently purified by gel-filtration chromatography ( Windsor Park Lab Inc , Teaneck , NJ ) .
IgG anti-monocyte control antibodies , Hee 7 ( CD31 ) , B4 ( CD11/18 ) , and W6/32 ( HLA Class I ) were from Dr W. Muller ( Rockefeller University , New York , NY ) , Dr S. Wright ( Rockefeller University ) , and ATCC , respectively .
Anti-CD15 ( PM81 ) and anti-CD31 ( hee 7 ) antibodies were fluorescein conjugated by incubating 500 gL of MoAb ( 1 mg/mL at pH 9.0 ) with 50 pL .
fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) ( 1 mg/mL ) in the dark for 8 hours at 4°C .
Unbound FITC was removed by extensive dialysis .
Affinity purified F ( ab ) ' 2 goat antimouse IgM or IgG were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch ( West Grove , NJ ) .
All MoAbs were used at saturating concentrations ( ~10 pg/mL ) at a level that resulted in minimal cell aggregation as assessed by flow cytometry and light microscopy .
Cross-linking studies .
- Monocytic cells ( 5 X 10° ) were suspended in culture medium containing 10 pg of anti-CD15 MoAb per mL and incubated at 4°C for 20 minutes .
Cells were then washed and incubated with F ( ab ) ; fragments of goat antimouse IgM or IgG ( 10 pg/mL ) at 4°C for 20 minutes .
To allow cross-linking , cells were washed and then warmed to 37°C before performing assays described below . ``
To assess for optimal cross-linking , in some studies FITC-conjugated antibodies were used and cells were examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy 10 minutes after rewarming .
As shown in Fig 1 , in the absence of the F ( ab ) ; secondary antibody , anti-CD15 ( PM81 , IgM ) stained monocytic cells ( MM6 ) in a rim pattern consistent with a uniform surface distribution of antigen .
In the presence of the cross-linking F ( ab ) } , however , the fluoresence pattern changed with clear demonstration of antigen patching and capping of antigen of a majority of cells ( ~70 % ) .
Similar results were seen with multiple control IgM and IgG antimouse monocytic antibodies .
A fluorescence micrograph of CD31 is shown in Fig 1 as a representative example .
Enzymatic removal of monocyte surface CD14 .
Mononuclear cells ( 1 x 10° cells/mL ) were suspended for 60 minutes at 37°C in HEPES-buffered RPMI 1640 containing bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( 2 mg/mL ) and PI-PLC ( 10 U/mL , equivalent to ~15 ug/ mL ) .
After the treatment , cells were washed twice with RPMI and then cross-linked with CD15 MoAb as described above .
Loss of CD14 surface expression was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) , and was consistently > =70 % ( data not shown ) .
Cytokine assays .
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ( Clontech Lab , Inc , Palo Alto , CA ) was used to monitor the release of TNF-a from monocytes after cross-linking CD15 . ``
Quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) was used to measure steady-state levels of TNF- and IL-1 , mRNA . ``
Total RNA was isolated from MM6 cells ( 2 X 10° cells ) with RNAzo !
( Biotecx Lab , Inc , Houston , TX ) , reversed transcribed , `` and a known amount of cDNA ( 0.2 uL ) amplified in the presence of defined concentrations of a synthetic competitor DNA for 30 cycles using specific primer pairs ( Clontech ) .
Control reactions included RNA samples in which the reverse transcription reaction mixture was omitted .
PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1 % agarose gels , visualized by ethidium bromide staining , and photo-graphed .
The negatives of the photographs were analyzed by laser densitometry , and the absolute absorbance values of the PCR products were determined .
The ratios of the absorbance of the relevant PCR product pairs were plotted against the concentration of the competitor DNA and the concentration of PCR product calculated .
Preparation of nuclear extracts .
- Nuclear extracts of monocytic cells ( MM6 ) were harvested using the modified protocol of Schricber et al `` `` following cell stimulation with either CD15 cross-linking or bacterial LPS ( 10 ng/mL ) for timed intervals from 15 to 180 minutes at 37°C .
Protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) and stored at -70°C until use .

MM6 cells ( 1 x 10° ) were suspended in culture medium containing 10 ug FITC-conjugated anti-CD15 or anti-CD31 MoAb per mL and incubated at 4°C for 20 minutes .
Cells were then washed and incubated with F ( ab ) ; fragments of goat anti-mouse IgM ( for CD15 ) or IgG ( for CD31 ) at a concentration of 10 ug/ml at 4°C for 20 minutes .
Cells were washed and then warmed to 37°C for 10 minutes and examined by fluorescent microscopy .
Shown are phase-fluoresecence pairs ( A and B , respectively ) for cells incubated with anti-CD15 alone ( second row } , anti-CD15 plus F ( ab ) ; secondary antibody ( third row ) , and anti-CD31 plus F ( ab ) ; secondary antibody ( bottom ) .
The top row shows cells incubated with the F ( ab ) ; secondary antibody in the absence of primary antibody .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
- Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the immunoglobulin « light chain NF- « B consensus sequence ( 5'-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3 ' ) , the AP-1 consensus sequence ( 5'-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3 ' ) , and the SV40 promoter specific protein-1 ( SP-1 ) consensus sequence ( 5-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3 `` ) were obtained from Promega ( Madison , WI ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described by Delude et al . ``
In some experiments , 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides were preincu-bated with the protein on ice for 5 minutes before the addition of the radioactive probe to assess the specificity of protein/DNA complexes .
Competition for binding to the nuclear factor « kB ( NF-kB ) oligonucleotide was seen with 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF- « B oligonucleotide , but not with excesses of the AP-1 or SP-1 oligonucleotides ( data not shown ) , thus demonstrating that only NF-kB was actually present in the nuclear fraction obtained from unstimulated MM6 .
IL-1B promotor regulation .
An IL-18 promoter/enhancer con 309 struct consisting of -3757 bp to +15 bp of the human IL-1 , gene coupled to the thymidine kinase promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene* `` was transfected into MMG using a modified DEAE-Dextran method .
After 48 hours , the cells were exposed to LPS ( 1 pg/mL ) or cross-linked with anti-CD15 for 16 hours at 37°C .
Unstimulated cells served as negative controls .
Following stimulation , transfected cells were then harvested and disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles .
Supernatants were mixed with `` `` C -chloramphenicol ( DuPont NEN , Boston , MA ) and acetyl-CoA ( Sigma ) for 6 hours .
Acetylated `` *C-chloramphenicol species were separated by thin-layer chromatography ( TLC ) in chloroform : metha-nol ( vol/vol , 95:5 ) .
The dried TLC sheet was exposed to KODAK X-OMAT AR film ( VWR Scientific , Piscataway , NJ ) and quantified by PhosphoImager .
Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfection with a -galactosidase expression plasmid .
IL-1B mRNA stability .
To determine if CD15 cross-linking affected IL-18 mRNA degradation , we examined mRNA stability in monocytic cells ( MM6 ) treated with actinomycin D ( 5 ug/ mL ) , which blocks the initiation of mRNA transcription .
Total RNA was harvested from actinomycin D-treated MM6 at different times ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 hours ) following cell stimulation .
Quantitative RT-PCR was then performed on this RNA .
Statistical analysis .
- All values were expressed as means + standard error ( SE ) .
Student 's t-test was used to compare means for statistical significance at P < .05 .
RESULTS Immunologic Cross-Linking CD15 on Monocytes Induced TNF-a Release Cross-linking CD15 on human mononuclear leukocytes with any of three MoAbs ( ie , PM81 , 80H5 , UN-172 ) induced significant TNF- « release ( Fig 2 ) .
Time course studies showed that TNF- « release was detected by 2 to 3 hours and reached a peak at 6 hours ( Fig 3 ) .
At 6 hours , 5 to 10 ng of TNF-a was present per mL of conditioned media harvested from anti-CD15 cross-linked monocytes , compared with < 0.5 ng/mL from the untreated cells , thus representing > 10-fold increase from the basal levels .
Cross-linking other cell surface antigens expressed abundantly on monocytes , including the glycoproteins CD31 , CD11/CD18 , and HLA with IgG MoAbs did not induce TNF- @ release .
Furthermore , cross-linking structurally related carbohydrate antigens with specific IgM MoAbs , including nonsialylated lactosamine , sialyl-CD15 , and dimeric sialyl-CD15 also had no effect ( Fig 3 ) , demonstrating specificity .
We and others have established that lymphocytes do not express CD15® and treatment of mononuclear fractions that had been depleted of monocytes ( ie , > 95 % CD2+* lymphocytes as determined by flow cytometry ) by the same three anti-CD15 antibodies did not induce detectable TNF-a release ( < 0.1 ng/mL , n = 3 experiments ) , demonstrating that monocytes were the likely source of the TNF-a released from the mononuclear cell preparations .
Bacterial LPS is a potent inducer of TNF- « release from monocytes and commonly contaminates many reagents .
LPS concentrations in all MoAb preparations were < 0.06 ng/mL as determined by a limulus lysate assay .
We also performed a series of studies showing that the effect of cross-linking CD15 was likely not the result of undetectable LPS contamination .
Neither primary nor secondary antibody alone was sufficient to induce TNF-a release ( Fig 4 ) .

Furthermore , LPS activation has been shown to require monocyte expression of CD14 , a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked protein .
The nearly complete removal of CD14 by treatment with PIPLC-specific phospholipase C ( 15 pg/mL ) did not abrogate the TNF-a release induced by CD15 cross-linking ( Fig 4 ) , while it completely abolished TNF- « release induced by LPS ( data not shown ) .
These data indicate that monocyte activation mediated by CD15 could not be attributed to LPS contamination and suggest a distinct signaling pathway .

Human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes prepared by ficoll gradient centrifugation ( 2 x 10° cells ) were incubated with three anti-CD15 IgM MoAbs ( PM81 , 80H5 , UN-172 ) at a concentration of 10 ug/ml for 20 minutes at 4°C .
Cells were then cross-linked by the addition of goat anti-ligM F ( ab ) ; and allowed to incubate for 6 hours at 37°C .
TNF-a released into the culture supernatant was then determined by ELISA .
A representative of six separate experiments is shown .
Cross-linking mononuclear leukocytes with anti-CD31 ( MoAb hec-7 ) , anti-CD11/ CD18 ( MoAb 1B4 ) , or anti-HLA ( MoAb W6/32 ) for 6 hours was used for comparison .
To determine the cell source of TNF-a , monocyte-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( > 95 % lymphocytes ) were shown not to screte TNF , either under basal condi- PM81 tions ( labeled control ) or after CD15 cross-linked for ﬂﬁm 6 hours at 37°C ( last column ) .

We detected a time-dependent increase in both TNF-a and IL-1/ # mRNAs ( Fig 6 ) .
A control transcript , -actin , did not change ( Fig 6 ) .
To determine if CD15 may alter mRNA degradation , we treated MM6 cells with actinomycin D ( 5 pg/mL ) , which inhibits transcription .
While LPS ( 10 ng/mL ) enhanced the degradation of transcripts , CD15 cross-linking resulted in a reduction in the rate of IL-1 # mRNA degradation ( Fig 7 ) .
To assess the mechanism by which CD15 may mediate the changes in cytokine mRNAs , we also studied expression of an promoter/enhancer plasmid construct transfected into MM6 cells .

Steady-state cytokine mRNA levels increased after CD15 cross-linking .
Two micrograms of total RNA from unstimulated MM6 cells ( as a control ) or MM6 that were stimulated with anti-CD15 cross-linking ( PM81 , 10 g/mL , 4 hours ) were used as templates for cDNA synthesis .
Aliquots were then amplified in the presence of 10-fold serial dilutions of the TNF-a competitors ( 617 bp ) or IL-1§ competitors ( 802 bp ) ( lanes 2 to 9 ) .
Lane 1 depicts control PCR whereby the reverse transcription reaction mixture was omitted .

These data suggest that cytokine release induced by cross-linking CD15 was the result of both a specific increase in gene transcription , and in the case of IL-1/3 , a reduction in the rate of mRNA degradation .
Nuclear translocation of transcription factors after CD15 cross-linking .
- To identify potential transcriptional factors involved in mediating CD15-induced gene regulation , we assessed nuclear fractions of stimulated monocytes using an electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay .
Nuclear extracts obtained from untreated MM6 cells contained minor constitutive levels of proteins that bound synthetic DNA oligomers representing binding sites for AP-1 , NF- « B , or SP-1 .
The specificity of complex formation was demonstrated by competition experiments with unlabeled oligonucleotides .
Cross-linking CD15 induced increased binding of nuclear proteins to the labeled AP-1 oligomer , but only minimal changes of the NF- « B and no changes of SP-1 levels ( Fig 8 ) .
In contrast , cross-linking nonfucosylated lactosamine carbohydrate antigens ( MoAb IB2 ) had no effect , demonstrating specificity .
DISCUSSION Data from our laboratory and others** suggest that E-selectin tethering of monocytes on cytokine-activated endothelial cells may contribute to monocyte activation during 311 the early stages of the inflammatory response .
In this study we report that immunologic cross-linking of an E-selectin ligand , CD15 , induced expression of proinflammatory cyto-kines through activation of transcriptional and posttranscriptional pathways .
The effect of CD15 cross-linking was spe-cific , as cross-linking of other surface antigens with isotypic MoAbs to other carbohydrate and glycoprotein antigens had no effect .

RNA from control MM6 cells ( 1 x 10° cells ) or MM6 cells cross-linked for various times ( 1 to 4 hours ) was analyzed as in Fig 4 .
For each experiment , control tubes in which reverse transcriptase or RNA was excluded gave no signal after amplification , documenting the absence of contamination .
The competitor concentrations used were 10~* `` mol/L for TNF-a , 10~*°mol/L for IL-18 , and 10° mol/L B-actin .
Thirty cycles of PCR were performed and the PCR amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis .
B-Actin served as a negative control .
Increased steady-state mRNAs were calculated using zero time as a reference .

312 accounted for by LPS contamination because boiling of anti-CD15 MoAb abolished TNF induction , while enzymatic removal of the LPS receptor , CD14 , had no effect .
While the sialylated form of CD15 is probably the major recognition motif for E-selectin-mediated leukocyte attachment to activated endothelial cells , `` `` the role of nonsialylated CD15 in monocyte adhesion is less clear .
Our data , however , clearly demonstrate that cross-linking CD15 , but not sCD15 or dimeric sCD15 , resulted in monocyte activation .
It is conceivable that E-selectin interaction with sialyl-CD15 may predominately mediate initial monocyte teth-ering , while concomitant or subsequent engagement of the nonsialylated form then mediates cell activation .
The capacity of CD15 to activate monocytes may be particularly relevant to atherosclerosis where monocyte adhesion is an early and prominent histological feature .
Consistent with this hypothesis is the finding by Landers et al `` `` that a subpopulation of adherent macrophages associated with the intimal lumen during early lesions of atherosclerosis expressed high levels of tissue factor .
The exact nature of the putative protein molecule ( s ) bearing CD15 that mediates cell-activation is unknown . ``
Albrechtsen et al ' `` have shown that CD15 is associated with CD11/CD18 integrins , but CD15 is also found on neutrophils from leukocyte-deficient patients ( lacking CD11/CD18 ) , `` and blockade of CD11/CD18 did not effect monocyte activation by adhesion to TNF-treated endothelial cells . ``

- Effect of CD15 cross-linking on IL-18 mRNA stability .
CD15 cross-linking reduced degradation .
Mono Mac 6 cells ( 2 x 10°/ condition ) were incubated with an anti-CD15 MoAb ( PM81 , 10 g/ mL ) for 20 minutes followed by F ( ab ) ; goat antimouse IgM ( 10 g/ mL ) .
Actinomycin D ( 5 pg/mL ) was added to cells 2 hours after the CD15 cross-linking and total RNA was extracted at the designated time ( hours ) .
The level of steady-state of IL-18 mRNA was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR .
The percent of maximal-induced IL-18 was calculated using the 2-hour time point as the zero time reference for comparison with the residual IL-18 mRNA at the later time points .
Shown is a representative experiment of two separate studies .

Nuclear translocation of transcription factors after CD15 cross-linking .
Nuclear extracts from Mono Mac 6 cells cross-linked with an anti-15 MoAb ( PM81 , 10 g/mL ) for varying time periods were incubated with `` P-labeled oligonucleotide binding sites for AP-1 , NF- « B , or SP-1 .
Binding of specific nuclear proteins was detected by a shift in electrophoretic mobility .
Cross-linking CD15 increased AP-1 , while only minimally effecting NF-B and SP-1 .
matic removal of CD14 did not affect the cellular response , indicating a minimal role , if any , for this LPS receptor in mediating the CD15 effect .
Engagement of a number of monocyte antigens , including CD44 and CD45 , has been shown to cause monocyte activation and lead to TNF- « @ release in vitro , `` whether the CD44 and CD45 glycoproteins bear CD15 is unknown .
It is also not known whether a human homologue of the recently identified murine ESL-1 glycoprotein is present on monocytes , or whether ESL-1 is capable of transmitting cellular signals .

CD15 MEDIATES MONOCYTE ACTIVATION Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that CD15 cross-linking was associated with specific nuclear signaling events .
Cross-linking CD15 led to a time-dependent increase in nuclear translocation of AP-1 and a small increase in NF- « B , but not SP-1 .
The AP-1 increase is consistent with the experimental data from many laboratories showing that AP-1 may be critical in monocyte activation including cytokine-dependent TNF- « , tissue factor , and induc-tion . ``
'' Sequence analysis of TNF-a , tissue factor and promoters indicate the presence of multiple sites for AP-1 , NF- « B , and SP-1 .
> * It is of interest to note that LPS-depen-dent activation differed from CD15 cross-linking in that LPS increases both NF- « B and AP-1 , while CD15 was mainly dependent on AP-1 , suggesting that the signals associated with CD15 ligation are unique .
In parallel with our data are those of Haskill et al `` `` who have shown that monocyte adhesion to substratum increased the mRNA of the protein components of AP-1 , c-jun , and c-fos .
While the exact cellular signaling pathway mediated by the CD15 in monocytes awaits further investigations , our data suggest that CD15-mediated monocyte activation may represent a novel and distinct signaling pathway .
