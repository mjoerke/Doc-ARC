A cell-type-independent lipopoly-saccharide ( LPS ) -responsive enhancer element located between -3757 and -2729 bp upstream from the transcription start site ( cap site ) consisted of at least six discrete subregions which were essential to the maximal induction by LPS in transfected monocytes .
The enhancer also appeared to mediate phorbol myristate acetate induction in monocytes and IL-1 responsiveness in fibroblasts .
Deletion and base substitution mutations along with DNA binding studies demonstrated that the enhancer contained a minimum of three functional protein binding sequences , two of which appeared to be important for gene induction .
One of the essential proteins which bound to the enhancer was similar or identical to members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors required for both IL-1- and LPS-specific induction of the IL-6 gene ( i.e .
, the NF-IL6 proteins ) .
When ligated to the prolL-1B cap site-proximal region ( located between -131 to +12 ) , both the proIL-1B and the simian virus 40 enhancer elements functioned more efficiently in monocytes than in HeLa cells , which are not normally competent for IL-1B expression .
When ligated to the murine c-fos promoter , however , the prolL-16B enhancer was inducible in phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated HeLa cells , suggesting the existence of a prolL-1B promoter-proximal requirement for tissue specificity .
Interleukin 18 ( IL-1B ) , a 17-kDa cytokine involved in inflammatory and immunological processes , is produced by activated monocytes/macrophages , fibroblasts , endothelial cells , and other cell types .
The IL-1 proteins are translated as larger 31-kDa precursors ( proIL-1 ) which are extracellu-larly processed into smaller 17-kDa forms ( mature IL-1 ) ( 4 , 20 ) .
There are two prolIL-1 genes ( proIL-la « and proIL-1 $ B ) coding for distinct proteins which are observed in many different species ( 7 , 18 ) .
The two prolIL-1 genes are located on human chromosome 2 ( 11 , 30 , 48 ) and show a high conservation of exon/intron structure ( 7 ) .
IL-1 has a variety of biological activities on a wide range of tissues ( see reference 13 for a review ) .
For example , IL-1 induces the production of inflammatory mediators , proteolytic enzymes , and other cytokines that are involved in the joint destruction and inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis ( 29 ) .
IL-1 also modifies connective tissue and bone metabolism through the induction and type switch of collagen and the induction of bone resorption ( 21 ) .
The proIL-1B gene is normally not transcribed in competent cells until activated by stimuli such as lipopolysaccha-ride ( LPS ) or phorbol 12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) or by 17-kDa IL-1B protein ( 9 , 13 , 14 ) .

1332 with LPS , IL-1B mRNA is rapidly and transiently transcribed in the absence of protein synthesis ( 15 ) , suggesting the activation of preexisting transcription factors .
Our previous studies revealed the importance of promoter sequences immediately upstream of the transcription start site ( cap site ) ( 3 , 8 , 10 , 14 , 24 , 26 ) in regulating proIL-1B gene expression .
Other studies have shown that the specific induction of the gene requires sequences both far upstream of the cap site as well as in the first intervening sequence ( 3 , 5 ) .
The far-upstream sequences described by Bensi et al .
( 5 ) define a PMA-responsive enhancer sequence located between positions -2982 and -2795 .
Further deletion of this region by these investigators revealed that removal of sequences either between -2982 and -2929 or between -2877 and -2795 abolished gene induction .
In this report , we show that the LPS-responsive region maps to the general location within the gene previously reported for PMA induction by Bensi et al .
( 5 ) .
However , in contrast to the PMA-inducible enhancer , we demonstrate that the LPS-responsive region ( located between -3757 and -2729 ) extends an additional 150 to 775 bp upstream of the PMA-sensitive region and contains discrete cooperative regions which provide tissue-specific expression only in the context of cap site-proximal proIL-1B promoter sequences .
At least three distinct nuclear factors are observed to bind to essential regions of this enhancer .
Analyses of specific nucleotide substitutions and deletions demonstrate that decreasing the binding efficiency Vor .
13 , 1993 for at least two of these factors results in a corresponding decrease in LPS-dependent gene expression .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Endotoxin tests .
All materials and solutions , including plasmids , phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , media , and fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) for tissue culture and transfection , were tested for endotoxin by a Limulus amebocyte lysate assay ( QCL-1000 ; Whittaker Bioproducts , Inc. , Walkersville , Md . )
.
To reduce endotoxin levels , glassware and CsCl were baked and sterile irrigation water ( Baxter Healthcare Corp. , Deerfield , III . )
was used for the preparation of all aqueous solutions .
Endotoxin contamination of plasmids , PBS , media , and FBS was also monitored by Northern ( RNA ) dot blot analysis using IL-1B cDNA as a probe .
Cell lines .
A human monocytic cell line , THP-1 ( ATCC TIB 202 ) , and a murine macrophage cell line , RAW 264.7 ( ATCC TIB 71 ) , were carefully maintained in RPMI 1640 medium-25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethane-sulfonic acid ( HEPES ) with L-glutamine ( 0.08 endotoxin unit/ml ; Whittaker ) containing 10 % FBS ( defined FBS ; less than 0.06 endotoxin unit/ml ; HyClone Laboratories , Logan , Utah ) and 0.5 % penicillin-streptomycin .
Cells were discarded when they either exhibited morphological changes or lost their LPS-dependent IL-1B mRNA transcription response .
The media for THP-1 cells also contained 5 x 10~* M 2-mercaptoethanol , which was essential for cell maintenance as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection .
RAW 264.7 cells were split after being washed with PBS and then incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 20 mM EDTA .
HeLa cells ( ATCC CCL 2 ) and human foreskin fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % FBS and penicillin-streptomycin .
Plasmids .
Human IL-1B genomic DNA fragments were derived from clone BDC454 ( 7 ) and inserted into chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene plasmid vectors pA10OCAT3M ( 3M ) , pA10CAT3ME ( 3ME ) ( 31 ) , and fos CAT ( fos ) ( 33 ) .
The nomenclature used for the various proIL-1B constructs reflects the nature of inserted fragments .
In this nomenclature , letter symbols reflect the specific restriction enzyme used and numerals locate the endpoints of polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) primers .
For example , P ; T represents a Pvull-Taql fragment , whereas -29871T represents a fragment derived from a PCR primer starting with -2987 at one end and ending with a Taql-digested end at the other .
The DNA fragments were generated either by restriction endonuclease digestion or by using PCR primer oligonucleotides to generate deletions or site-directed mutants as described previously ( 23 ) .
The alkaline lysis plasmid preparations ( 41 ) were purified twice on CsCl-ethidium bromide gradients .
The DNA used for transfection was assayed for supercoiled density by agarose gel electrophoresis .
Endotoxin levels of each batch were monitored by the Limulus assay , and only DNA preparations containing less than 0.03 endotoxin unit/ug were used .
DNA sequencing .
The upstream region of the human IL-1B gene and all novel CAT constructs were sequenced according to the method reported by Kraft et al .
( 28 ) , in which double-stranded miniprep DNA was directly used as the template for sequence analysis .
Transfection .
RAW 264.7 cells ( 4 x 10° cells per plate ) , HeLa cells ( 5 x 10° cells per plate ) , or human foreskin fibroblasts ( 10° cells per plate ) were plated in 100-mm-diameter culture plates 24 h before transfection .
Immedi- NF-IL6é IS IMPORTANT FOR proIL-1B GENE EXPRESSION 1333 ately before CaPO , transfection , the cells were washed with 10 ml of DMEM three times and incubated in 10 ml of DMEM containing 10 % FBS and penicillin-streptomycin for 3 or 4 h. The transfection was accomplished using a CaPO , mammalian cell transfection kit ( 5 Prime- > 3 Prime , Inc. , Boulder , Colo. ) .
Twenty micrograms of plasmid was gently mixed with 0.5 ml of 2x HEBS ( 50 mM HEPES [ pH 7.05 ] , 1.5 mM Na , HPO , , 10 mM KCl , 280 mM NaCl , 12 mM glucose ) and 62 pl of 2 M CaCl ; in 1 ml and incubated at room temperature for 20 min in order to generate a fine precipitate , which was added to the cells .
The plate was incubated for 5 h and then subjected to a 15 % glycerol shock , which was carried out for approximately 2 to 3 min , depending upon cell type .
After being washed with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium three times , cells were then incubated in RPMI 1640 medium ( or DMEM for HeLa cells ) containing 10 % FBS and penicillin-streptomycin RAW 264.7 cells were incubated for 18 h and then stimulated with 10 ug of LPS ( Escherichia coli serotype O55 : B5 ; Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , Mo . )
per ml for an additional 8 h prior to harvest .
HeLa cells were incubated in 10 ml of DMEM containing 10 % FBS and penicillin-streptomycin for 40 h and then stimulated with 50 ng of PMA per ml for an additional 24 h. Fibroblasts were incubated for 8 h and then stimulated with 0.1 to 10 ng of human recombinant ( 50 ) per ml for an additional 15 h. The THP -1 cells were plated at 4 x 10° cells per ml the day before transfection .
The cells were washed twice with unsupplemented RPMI 1640 prior to transfection , and 10 `` cells in 1 ml of the same medium were mixed with DEAE-DNA transfection solution prepared as follows : 10 ug of DNA was mixed with 0.5 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl ( pH 7.2 ) and 7.5 ml of unsupplemented RPMI 1640 , mixed well , and added to 1 ml of 2-mg/ml DEAE-dextran ( ~500,000 , average molecular weight ; Pharmacia LKB , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
Cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to centrifu-gation and resuspension into 10 ml of unsupplemented RPMI 1640 containing 1.5 U of heparin sodium ( Elkins-Sinn , Inc. , Cherry Hill , N.J. ) .
The cells were then immediately centrifuged and washed in unsupplemented medium prior to resuspension in 10 ml of complete medium and incubated at 37°C in 10-cm-diameter tissue culture dishes .
After 24 h , cells were stimulated with LPS ( £ .
coli 055 : B5 ; 10 ug/ml ; Sigma ) or PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) and incubated for an additional 24 h before harvesting .
CAT assay .
After harvest , cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS twice and resuspended in 150 pl of 0.25 M Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) -0.1 % Triton X-100 .
After three freeze-thaw cycles , cell lysates were heat inactivated at 65°C for 10 min and micro-centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min , and supernatant concentrations were measured with Bio-Rad protein assay kit .
The CAT assays were carried out by a liquid scintillation method ( 45 ) , using 100 ug of THP-1 , 50 ug of RAW 264.7 , and 100 ug of HeLa cell lysates in 150 and 100 pl of a mixture of 2.5 mM chloramphenicol ( Sigma ) and 0.5 mCi of [ *HJacetyl coen-zyme A ( NEN ) .
CAT activities were evaluated by calculating slopes within a linear range of the response .
Preparation of nuclear extracts .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by a method previously reported ( 12 , 37 , 44 ) , with modifications .
After a 45-min incubation with LPS ( 10 pg/ml or 1-h incubation with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) , 1 x 10° to 3 x 10 cells were harvested , washed with PBS , and incubated in 5 mi of buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] at 4°C , 5 mM MgCl , 10 mM NaCl , 0.3 M sucrose , 0.1 mM EGTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [ PMSF ] ) containing 1 mg of each of the protease inhibitors 1334 SHIRAKAWA ET AL .
antipain , aprotinin , chymostatin , leupeptin , and pepstatin A per ml on ice for 5 to 10 min .
After centrifugation , the cells were resuspended in 1 mi of buffer A with protease inhibitors and then Dounce homogenized .
The homogenate was micro-centrifuged for 30 s , and nuclei were resuspended in 0.8 ml of buffer B with protease inhibitors ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 5 mM MgCl , , 300 mM KCI , 0.2 mM EGTA , 25 % glycerol , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) and gently rocked on a platform at 4°C for 30 min .
After 30 min of microcentrifugation at 4°C , supernatants were dialyzed against 50 volumes of buffer D ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 100 mM KCI , 0.2 mM EDTA , 20 % glycerol , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) at 4°C for 6 h or overnight .
After 30 min of microcentrifugation at 4°C , ali-quots of supernatants were frozen at -70°C and protein concentrations were measured by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit .
Preparation of radiolabeled electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) probes .
Probes were labeled by filling in 3 ' recessed ends by using DNA polymerase Klenow fragment and all four a-*°P-labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates ( dNTPs ) at 3,000 Ci/mmol ( DuPont-NEN ) as described previously ( 41 ) .
Unincorporated dNTPs were removed by use of G-25 or G-50 columns ( 5 Prime- > 3 Prime ) .
EMSA .
EMSA was carried out by the previously reported method ( 44 ) , using 4 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 % TAE buffer ( 6.67 mM Tris [ pH 7.5 } , 3.3 mM sodium acetate , 1 mM EDTA ) .
Binding reactions were performed in 15 ul of a buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM B-mercaptocthanol , 4 % glycerol , 0 to 40 mM NaCl for different probes ) containing probe ( 0.2 ng , 5,000 to 20,000 cpm ) , 0.2 to 0.8 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , and 6 ug of nuclear extracts at room temperature for 20 min .
The gels were run at 4°C .
Nucleotide sequence accession number .
The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper have been submitted to GenBank and assigned accession number LO6808 .
RESULTS Identification of an upstream region required for LPS induction .
To identify the sequence requirements for prolL-1B gene transcription , transiently transfected CAT constructs which contained variable lengths of upstream sequence were introduced into monocyte cell lines .
We previously showed that LPS was capable of generating at least a 10-fold stimulation of the endogenous gene in intact cells ( 15 ) .
Our earlier reports on proIL-18B gene transcription in transfected human THP-1 monocytic cells suggested that DNA sequences located between -1097 and +384 in the human proIL-1f gene were not capable of supporting a strong transcriptional induction by LPS ( 3 , 8 ) .
We have now extended our upstream clones beyond those previously reported ( constructs PT , AT , DT , NT , and HT [ 8 ] ) to include new CAT constructs terminating almost 4 kb upstream of the transcription start site .
In contrast with our earlier studies , which used THP-1 human monocyte cell lines , the murine monocyte cell line RAW 264.7 ( 38 ) was used .
This cell line was chosen for our studies because we observed that calcium phosphate transfection of these cells does not result in proIL-1B gene transcription and that a 15-kb human proIL-1B gene corresponding to the entire prolIL-1f structural gene and flanking sequences ( i.e .
, DNA located between the previously described upstream EcoRI site and the downstream Sa/l site in clone BDC-454 [ 7 ] ) is regulated in a manner which is indistinguishable from that of the endogenous murine gene Mor .

when stably introduced into RAW 264.7 cells ( 46 ) .
Our earlier work suggested a link between the method of THP-1 transfection and gene induction ( 3 , 8 ) .
In fact , we have now found that electroporation of these cells resulted in transcriptional induction of the proIL-1B gene and a desensitization from further induction by the addition of a stimulant such as LPS or PMA ( data not shown ) .
We have more recently determined that DEAE-dextran can be used to efficiently transfect THP cells without significant proIL-1fB gene induction ( 24 , 26 ) .
As a consequence , we are now able to examine the specific induction of this gene in the milieu of a human cell line in which we have previously studied the expression of the endogenous gene .

Summary of CAT data for proIL-1B gene deletions transfected into murine RAW 264.7 cells .
Specific proIL-18B gene sequences ( horizontal bars ) inserted upstream of the CAT coding sequence of the 3M vector are aligned with a schematic locating specific restriction enzyme sites ( enzyme names and locations as indicated ) and synthetic PCR primers ( locations indicated ) .
The schematic also shows the location of the P ; Xho fragment ( open box ) described in the text and in subsequent figures as well as the location of an NF-IL6-like binding sequence ( solid circle ) .
The histogram presents uninduced ( open bars ) and LPS-induced ( solid bars ) CAT data represented as the mean of the slopes for plots of time versus counts per minute .
The value for each construct represents results from a minimum of two experiments ( average was five experiments ) with an average deviation of 55 % .
reported ( 7 ) and contains several potential transcription factor binding site motifs .
The sequence data shown in Fig .
1 facilitated the synthesis of oligonucleotide primers which were used to generate some of the CAT constructs shown in Fig .
2 , using recombinant PCR synthesis .
Specific fragments were subcloned into the promoterless 3M vector and assayed for CAT activity .
The progressive series of upstream end deletions in Fig .
2 shows that an LPS-dependent transcriptional response in murine RAW 264.7 cells was associated with the presence of DNA sequences located between the Xbal site at -3757 and position -2923 .
On the basis of the constructs used in this study , these sequences were delineated into three functional induction-specific regions .
The first region , located between -3757 and -3132 ( region A ) , appeared to be responsible for approximately 20 % of the LPS-inducible activity , and a second region , between -3132 and -2987 ( region B ) , appeared to correlate with 60 % of the activity .
The third region , located between -2987 and -2923 ( region C ) , appeared to be responsible for an additional 20 % of the activity .
Together , these data demonstrated that the -3132 to -2923 sequence ( regions B and C ) is a necessary component in LPS-specific induction and that the sequence between -3757 and -3132 ( region A ) was essential for maximal activity .
These data do not reveal , however , whether regions B and C are sufficient for induction , since regions downstream of -2923 may be necessary but insufficient for the response .
The upstream LPS induction region reveals internal coop-erativity , To address the possible involvement of sequences downstream of -2923 in LPS induction , sequences between -3132 and +12 were further tested by introducing internal deletions downstream of the PvuII site at -2729 .
The -3132 upstream terminus was chosen because a majority of the LPS induction shown in Fig .
2 mapped between the Pvull site and the Tagl site at +12 ( construct P ; T ) .
Internal deletions located between the Xhol site at -2729 and the functional prolL-1f promoter ( 8 , 24 ) were constructed in the 3M vector system ( constructs P ; Xho/PT and P ; Xho/HT ) .
Transfection of these constructs into RAW 264.7 cells revealed that although downstream sequences between -2729 and -131 might be essential for maximal induction , they were not necessary for the ability to respond to the induction signal ( Fig .
2 , 3M - P ; Xho/PT and 3M - P ; Xho/HT ) .
In support of this conclusion , when the Pvull-to-Xhol ( P , ; , Xho ) fragment was tested independently of the proIL-18 promoter-proximal DNA in RAW 264.7 cells by the use of a murine c-fos promoter , the level of LPS induction was similar to that of construct 3M - XT ( compare 3M - XT with P ; Xho/fos in the data for RAW 264.7 cells presented in Table 1 ) .
The P ; Xho/fos CAT construct was used to derive a series of additional constructs designed to further characterize the proIL-1B enhancer region .
The fos CAT vector data in Fig .
3 reveal that the sequence located between -3132 and -2729 ( construct 2 , P ; Xho ) generated a large relative LPS-induced activity when transfected either into RAW 264.7 or THP-1 cells .
The presence of additional sequence in construct 1 between -2729 and -2599 ( region J in Fig .
3C ) yielded a reduced activity which suggested the presence of a negative regulatory element .
The sequence between -3132 and -2987 ( region B ) in the context of the P ; Xho/fos CAT construct appeared to be essential ( compare constructs 2 and 1336 SHIRAKAWA ET AL .

3 with construct 8 ) , in agreement with the upstream deletion data shown in Fig .
2 .
However , the importance of this region was not as great when sequences between -2780 to -2599 ( region I+J ) were present ( compare construct 2 with constructs 7 and 8 ) , thus suggesting that region I+ ] can functionally compensate in part for the absence of region B .
Furthermore , as demonstrated in Fig .
3 , the DNA sequence located between -2894 and -2729 ( regions E through I ) was important for full LPS-dependent activity ( constructs 3 through 6 ) , and the sequence between -2894 and -2864 ( region E ) appeared to be a significant functional component of this region .
The importance of this 30-bp-long sequence was further substantiated by an internal deletion ( construct 10 ) .
However , although necessary , region E was not sufficient for LPS-dependent activity ( in particular , see construct 9 ) .
Comparison of the deleted sequence in construct 10 with sequences of a collection of known transcription factor binding sites revealed a close match ( 12 of 14 bp between -2882 and -2869 ) with that required for binding of factor NF-IL6 , a key component in IL-6 gene transcription ( 2 ) .
Therefore , either NF-IL6 or a related factor may be involved in prolIL-1fB gene transcription .
As shown in Fig .
2 , the P ; Xho/HT and P ; Xho/PT promoter CAT constructs which possessed internal deletions between -2729 and either -1097 or -131 appeared to be only partially active with respect to the intact P ; , T construct .
This finding suggests that additional sequences between -2729 and -1097 may be necessary to support transcription from the proIL-18B promoter .
The data presented in Fig .
3B support and extend those presented in Fig .
2 by defining additional sequence between -2894 and -2729 ( regions E through I ) to be indispensable for maximal LPS induction of the human prolL-1B gene .
It should be noted that the deletion studies shown in Fig .
3 are insufficient to address the importance of DNA-protein binding sites which either are located between -2987 and -2894 or span across the construct terminus located at -2987 .
However , the deletion data for the prolIL-1B promoter ( Fig .
2 ) support the importance of the sequence between -2987 and -2923 ( region C ) .
Taken together , Fig .
2 and 3B reveal a complex collection of regions required for LPS induction , as summarized in Fig .
The data in Table 1 and Fig .
3 show that murine RAW 264.7 cells and human THP-1 cells transfected with the fos CAT constructs revealed similar , but not identical , results which may reflect differences between the two systems .
The most striking difference is the higher activity , relative to P ; Xho/fos , for the P , -2864/fos construct transfected in RAW 264.7 versus THP-1 cells ( Fig .
3B , construct 5 ) .
In this case , it is interesting to note that the uninduced CAT activity for this construct is threefold greater than that of P ; Xho/fos , suggesting that the increased activity may be due to the removal of sequences which act as a silencer only in the RAW 264.7 cells .
As described above , Table 1 demonstrates that the P ; Xho/fos construct shown in Fig .
3B generated transcription activity in RAW 264.7 cells comparable to that of construct 3M - XT , which contains sequences between -3757 and +12 .
Table 1 also shows that the relative induction capacity of the P ; Xho/fos CAT construct transfected into human THP-1 monocyte cells was similar to that of the transfected murine cells .
Thus , it is likely that the requirements for LPS-inducible transcription are common to human and mouse cells , reflecting the likely involvement of similar transcription factors .
One major difference between the RAW 264.7 and THP-1 cells , however , was a strong suppression of activity in THP-1 associated with the presence of sequences located downstream of the P ; Xho fragment ( i.e .
, the low activity shown in Table 1 for 3M - and 3M - P ; , Xho/PT in THP-1 cells ) .
The presence of suppressive sequences suggests the possible involvement of additional positive-acting factors in THP-1 cells which may require additional sequences that lie beyond the boundaries of the P , T DNA .
Antisuppressive factors could bind to such sequences and overcome the suppression in the intact chro-mosomal gene .
Identification of protein binding sites within the proIL-1B LPS response element .
EMSAs were used to examine the nature of specific DNA-protein binding within the P ; Xho enhancer .
Figure 4A is a schematic representation of regions D through H indicating the locations of gene fragments which were used either as radiolabeled EMSA probes or as specific unlabeled competitors .
Figure 4B shows the sequences of the synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides which were used for EMSA analysis .
The results shown in Fig .
5A demonstrate that oligonucleotide IL6/I , containing the NF-IL6-like sequence in the human proIL-1f gene , did bind a THP-1 cell nuclear factor which was effectively competed for by unlabeled oligonucleotide IL6 , corresponding to the human NF-IL6 binding site previously characterized by Akira et al .
( 2 ) ( compare lanes 1 through 3 with lanes 6 and 7 ) .
As indicated in Fig .
5 , this factor generates a pattern of two or more bands , similar to that reported for the various forms of the NF-IL6 ( C/EBP ) factors ( 6 , 27 , 49 ) .
The binding of this protein was also specifically competed for by the unlabeled oligonucleotide IL6/I ( lanes 4 and 5 ) and was not strongly competed for by mutated versions of the IL6/I binding sequence ( AIL6/I and IL6/Im ; lanes 8 through 11 ) .
Figure 5B shows that the two distinct mutated radiolabeled IL6/I probes did not bind the THP-1 NF-IL6-like protein as well as they bound the wild-type sequence found in the prolL-1B gene .
In particular , the AIL6/I probe appeared to bind only a nonspecific protein which could not be displaced Vor .

( B ) Deletion constructs .
Deletion studies for the -3132 to -2599 region used the murine c-fos promoter transfected either into RAW 264.7 or THP-1 cells .
The indicated gene sequences were inserted immediately upstream of the -56 to +109 region of the murine c-fos promoter ( stippled box ) in the fos CAT vector .
This region consists of positions -56 to +109 of the murine c-fos genomic DNA sequence and appears to be devoid either of enhancer activity or of a strong relationship to sequence motifs for a large collection of known transcription factors ( 2a , 33 ) .
The CAT data are calculated and presented as for Fig .

The value for each construct represents results from a minimum of two experiments ( average was five experiments ) with average deviations of 29 % for the data from RAW 264.7 cells and 52 % for the data from THP-1 cells .
( C ) Summary of the murine RAW 264.7 cell CAT data presented in Fig .
2 and panels A and B. Shaded regions correspond to those that are required ( solid ) , strongly supportive ( cross-hatched ) , weakly supportive ( stippled ) , and not determined or unimportant ( open ) .
These regions are designated A through J and are described in detail throughout the text .
Bold brackets locate compensatory regions which appear to be able to substitute for one another .
The open bracket locates the PMA-responsive region previously reported ( 5 ) .
by unlabeled IL6/I competitor ( compare lane 6 with lanes 9 and 10 ) .
In contrast , the IL6/Im probe bound a specific NF-IL6-like displaceable factor ( lanes 14 and 15 ) but did not form all of the NF-IL6-like complexes observed with the IL6/I probe ( compare lanes 1 and 12 ) .
This result indicated that the sequence alteration did not completely abrogate binding ( see also Fig .
5A , lane 11 ) .
It therefore appeared that NF-IL6 , or another member of the C/EBP protein family , binds to an essential LPS-responsive region of the human proIL-1f gene .
A counterpart to the THP-1 cell NF-IL6-like factor appeared to also exist in RAW 264.7 cells ( not shown ) .
In contrast to THP-1 cells , RAW 264.7 cells did not generate high-quality EMSA data but rather yielded band patterns which , although similar to that observed with THP-1 ex-tracts , were more diffuse .
Figure 6A shows EMSA analysis of the region immediately downstream of the NF-IL6-like binding site , using an 84-bp oligonucleotide probe ( probe M1 in Fig .
4A ) .
Two primary groups of bands , labeled NF-B1 and NF-B2 , ap- peared to define the binding of two protein classes .
The competitor oligonucleotides MSS and 23D appeared to displace both the NF-B1 and NF-B2 band groups , whereas oligonucleotides D8 , B1 , and B2 selectively displaced only one group or the other .
On the basis of these data , it appears as though at least two proteins bind to the two adjacent sites on the M1 oligonucleotide probe .
Attempts to footprint these two binding sites on oligonucleotide M1 by using methylation interference have generated very weak results , probably because of the complex band patterns for the two groups of bands .
Nonetheless , the methylation interference data suggested the possibility that sites B1 and B2 overlap at positions -2845 and -2844 ( data not shown ) and have allowed us to design mutant oligonucleotides ( Fig .
4B ) which decreased the binding of these factors .
Figure 6A , lanes 12 and 13 as well as lanes 17 and 18 , reveal that two such mutants ( B1m and B2m ) , in contrast to the wild-type sequences ( B1 in lanes 10 and 11 ; B2 in lanes 15 and 16 ) , were not efficient competitors for the NF-B1 and NF-B2 factors .

of the base changes in the two mutant oligonucleotides ( Fig .
4B ) define the binding sites for these two factors .
Therefore , in good agreement with our tentative footprint data , the binding sites for NF-B1 and NF-B2 appear to be separated by no more than a single base pair .
To more carefully examine the nature of the NF-B1 and NF-B2 binding sites , the B1 and B2 oligonucleotides used as unlabeled competitors in Fig .
6A were employed as radiolabeled EMSA probes ( Fig .
6B and C ) .
These data , which were derived by using probes substantially shorter than the M1 oligonucleotide used in Fig .
6A , suggested some interesting contrasts .
First , the overall binding complexity was reduced for both factors , and in particular , the NF-B2 factor appeared to be represented as a single specific band rather than three bands ( Fig .
6B ) .
In addition , the binding of factor NF-B1 appeared to be compromised by the use of the shorter B1 oligonucleotide , suggesting a requirement either for additional DNA sequence or , perhaps , the binding of NF-B2 ( Fig .
6C ) .
Mutant protein binding sites in P , Xho/fos CAT decrease LPS-specific enhancer activity .
To ascertain the functional importance of specific protein-DNA associations , the above-described mutations were examined for functional relevance in the context of the LPS-responsive P ; Xho/fos CAT construct .
Four distinct mutants were derived from overlapping PCR primer techniques as described previously ( 23 ) .
Each of the mutants contained a single mutated binding site ( i.e .
, ILé/Im , AIL6/I , Blm , and BZ2m ) which contained either multiple base substitutions or a deletion in P ; Xho/fos CAT .
The resulting plasmids were transfected into RAW 264.7 cells and assayed for CAT activity as shown in Table 2 .
These data suggested that the NF-IL6 and NF-B1 binding sites were important for LPS-induced gene transcription .
In contrast , the presence of the B2 site did not appear to be required .
In addition , Table 2 shows that the IL-6 site is also important for expression in THP-1 cells .
Since the 14-bp deletion in P ; XhoAILO6/I ( Table 2 ) and the longer 31-bp deletion in P , XhoAXM ( Fig .
3B , construct 10 ) generated similar LPS-induced CAT activities relative to the P ; , CAT construct , it is likely that the loss of the IL-6 site is responsible for the reduced activity of P , ; XhoAXM .
Induction of the human prolL-16B gene by PMA and mature IL-1B protein .
The LPS induction of IL-1 provides a useful model system for monocyte activation , which has been extensively investigated ( 13 ) .
However , other agents such as PMA and mature IL-1 proteins have also been reported to induce prolIlL-1B gene transcription ( 9 , 16 ) .
The PMA stimulus is especially relevant because it has been shown to induce expression via a distinct pathway ( 16 , 42 ) .
In addition , the potential for autocrine effect renders the action of mature IL-1B on its own gene of interest as well .

structs 3M - P ; T and 3M - XT was inducible with recombinant human IL-1B protein ( Table 3 ) .
Furthermore , the IL-1B protein induction of 3M - XT appeared to respond in a dose-dependent fashion .
Similarly , Table 3 also shows that transfection of both RAW 264.7 monocytes and HeLa cells with the P ; Xho/fos construct was sensitive to PMA as a stimulus .
Consequently , the P ; Xho region of the proIL-1f gene appears to respond to at least two distinct induction signals , namely , LPS and PMA , and may be involved in the response to mature IL-1B protein as well .
Cell type transcription specificity requires sequences close to the transcription start site .
Since normal cellular expression of the proIL-1B gene is tissue specific , in that only certain cell types ( e.g .
, monocytes , fibroblasts , endothelial cells , and smooth muscle cells ) are induction competent in the absence of other differentiation or activation signals such as viral infection , it is of interest to address the question of whether there might be a region or regions essential for tissue-specific expression .
We chose to use HeLa cells , which we had previously determined were refractory to proIL-1B induction by PMA ( 8 ) , for transfection studies aimed at examining cell specificity .
As can be seen in Table 3 , the P , ; Xho/HT construct containing the proIL-1B promoter was 37-fold less efficiently transcribed in uninduced HeLa than was the P ; Xho/fos construct .
In addition , P ; Xho/ fos is PMA inducible in HeLa cells , but P ; Xho/HT is not .
Examining these efficiency differences further , we found that P ; Xho/HT was also eightfold more efficiently expressed in LPS-treated murine RAW cells than in PMA-stimulated HeLa cells ( Table 4 ) .
This finding contrasted with results for the P ; Xho/fos construct , which was efficiently induced in both cell lines .
To further examine this phenomenon , the prolIL-1B promoter sequences were introduced into the promoterless 3ME vector , which contains one complete copy of the 232-bp simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) enhancer .
Table 4 reveals that in the context of the SV40 enhancer , which is generally not tissue specific ( 39 ) , the proIL-1B promoter ( construct 3ME - HT ) appeared to be almost 30-fold more efficient at supporting induced transcription in RAW monocytes than in HeLa cells .
On the other hand , pSV2CAT , in which the SV40 enhancer was used in the context of the SV40 early promoter , was more highly induced in HeLa than in RAW cells .
In addition , while pSV2CAT was almost 3-fold more highly expressed than 3ME - HT in RAW cells , in HeLa cells the difference was more than 200-fold .
These data suggest that proIL-1B gene tissue specificity appears to be dependent upon sequences close to the transcription start site and independent of the nature of the enhancer .
DISCUSSION In this study , we have identified sequences within the human prolL-18 gene which are essential for the induction and maintenance of transcription .
Transient transfection of murine RAW 264.7 cells by using a CAT gene reporter demonstrates that far-upstream sequences located between -3132 and -2729 ( P ; Xho fragment ) are important for the induction response .
On the basis of CAT activity , a minimum of two subregions ( labeled C and E in Fig .
3C ) contained within the P ; Xho fragment are essential for activity .
These two subregions appear to be required for activity and cooperate with adjacent upstream sequences in regions Mor .

A and B and with adjacent downstream sequences located in regions F through I to support a maximal response .
The P ; Xho-inducible activation region appears to be cell type independent in the context of a non-prolIL-1B promoter ( murine c-fos promoter ) but is sensitive to cell type when associated with its cognate promoter .
Therefore , this cell type specificity does not reside exclusively within the proIL-1B enhancer region but rather requires the prolIL-1B promoter .
This promoter can also demonstrate cell specificity when associated with the noncognate SV40 enhancer ( Table 4 ) .
Thus , the tissue specificity for proIL-1B gene transcription may reside proximal to the promoter between positions -131 and +12 .
Important regions also exist between -2729 and -1097 as well as between -1097 and -131 , as demonstrated by the decreased activity of the two internal deletion constructs ( P ; Xho/PT and P ; Xho/HT ) shown in Fig .
2 .
The transfection data presented here contrast with those previously reported by Bensi et al .
( 5 ) in several ways .
First , both the THP-1 and the RAW 264.7 cells used in this study , unlike the THP-1 derivative cell line described by Bensi et al .
, exhibit endogenous prolIL-1B mRNA synthesis in response to treatment with LPS .
Therefore , in contrast to the previous report , we have demonstrated that transfected constructs are LPS responsive .
The LPS-responsive region reported here ( P ; Xho plus the additional upstream region A ) extends as much as 775 bp farther upstream than does the previously reported PMA-responsive region .
Furthermore , the LPS-specific transcriptional activity for a construct containing the PMA-responsive region of Bensi et al .
but lacking the additional upstream sequences reported here ( Fig .
2 , construct -2987T1 ) is only 20 % of that observed when the additional sequences are present ( Fig .
2 , construct XT ) .
Finally , the earlier study failed to note the functional segmentation of the region and the apparent cooperativity of these multiple elements as well as the requirement for the cap site-proximal sequences in establishing tissue specificity or maximal activity .
It is possible that some of these differences relate to distinctions among the cell types used , the nature of the induction agents , and the conditions used to maintain the cells .
For example , as mentioned above , we have carefully monitored endotoxin levels throughout all procedures in order to minimize induction artifacts .
Our observation that primary human dermal fibroblasts transiently transfected with constructs 3M - P ; T and 3M - XT respond to induction by IL-1B protein ( Table 3 ) demonstrates that the P ; Xho fragment contains a target for the activation of transcription by LPS and PMA and possibly also IL-1f protein .
Table 1 shows that in THP-1 cells , the response of the P ; Xho/fos CAT construct is similar to that observed in the murine RAW 264.7 cells .
In contrast , the 3M - P , ; T and 3M - P ; Xho/PT CAT constructs are not inducible in THP-1 cells , whereas they are inducible in RAW 264.7 cells ( Table 1 and Fig .
2 ) .
These data suggest the possible involvement of a transcriptional silencer in THP-1 cells located between -1097 and +12 along with the potential activation sites .
This is true both for constitutively expressing electroporated cells and for the inducible DEAE-dextran-transfected cells ( not shown ) .
The earlier observation that a THP-1 silencer activity may be overcome by the presence of the first intervening sequence in the proIL-1f gene ( 3 , 5 ) suggests that additional sequences may be essential to completely reconstitute normal gene function in these cells .
The human fibroblast studies ( Table 3 ) contrast with the THP-1 transfection results shown in Table 1 in that 3M « P ; T and 3M - XT generated a substantially greater induction , suggesting that either cell type or stimulus ( i.e .
, LPS versus mature IL-1f protein ) may affect the degree to which the effect of the downstream suppressive region is counteracted .
The P ; Xho fragment contains a recognition site which resembles that of the human NF-IL6 factor ( 2 ) , which has been identified as murine C/EBP3 ( 6 ) and IL-6DBP in the rat ( 36 ) .
The human NF-IL6 factor has been shown to be composed of at least two C/EBP -like proteins ( C/EBPRB and C/EBPy ) , which can form homo- and heterodimers ( 6 , 27 , 49 ) .
At least one of the NF-IL6 proteins has been shown to form a complex with the p50 subunit of NF- « B ( 32 ) .
The NF-IL6 factors have been postulated to be responsible for IL-1 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor , and LPS activation of the IL-6 gene ( 1 ) .
The binding site for this factor in the proIL-18 gene is located within the functionally essential region E. An FIG .

EMSA using DNA from this region reveals that the binding to the IL-1 sequence is indistinguishable from that observed with use of the reported NF-IL6 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
5 ) .
The band shift observed in the EMSA using the IL-1 oligonucleotide not only is similar to that reported elsewhere ( 2 , 25 ) but also is competed for by the bona fide NF-IL6 oligonucleotide .
Therefore , it is likely that an NF-IL6-related factor is indeed binding to this essential region .
The P ; Xho/fos CAT plasmid mutants , containing either the NF-IL6/Im base pair substitutions which reduce the binding of this factor or a deletion of the entire NF-IL6 binding site , show a 55 to 65 % decrease in LPS-inducible activity in RAW 264.7 cells and a 79 % decrease in THP-1 cells .
This finding demonstrates that the NF-IL6 factor has a functional role .
The fact that the activity is not completely abrogated by the NF-IL6 binding site deletion suggests a strong but partial role in activity .
We have observed that the NF-IL6 factor is present in significant amounts prior to LPS treatment and that the kinetics of the LPS-dependent increase in NF-IL6 factor binding in THP-1 cell nuclear extracts do not correlate with our earlier reported ( 15 ) rate of transcriptional induction ( not shown ) .
The presence of significant amounts of this factor prior to induction and the inactivity of a construct containing the NF-IL6 binding site ( construct 9 in Fig .
3B ) suggest that other cooperating factors are involved .
It should be noted that the expression of this factor by unstimulated cells is not inconsistent with an involvement in a critical role in LPS induction , since the NF-IL6 factor could require posttrans-lational modification or the association with other protein factors .
The involvement of NF-IL6 in the transcriptional activity of prolL-18 broadens the range for this factor to yet another gene involved in the manifestation of the acute-phase response which alters an organism 's physiology in response to inflammatory stress .
The other two factors which bind to the P ; Xho fragment include NF-B1 , which binds to a sequence resembling a binding site for factor IRF-1 , and the immediately adjacent novel NF-B2 binding site .
Factor IRF-1 has been reported to be essential for induction of the human beta interferon gene , which can be induced by virus , IL-1 , tumor necrosis factor , platelet-derived growth factor , and colony-stimulating factor 1 ( 17 , 22 ) .
This factor , which was originally defined in terms of its binding half-sequence ( the hexamer motif ) ( 17 ) , has recently been characterized ( 34 ) and has been shown to be induced by stimuli such as lectins and LPS as well as by various cytokines ( 22 ) .
The fact that NF-B1 appears to bind to a region containing a single hexamer motif ( i.e .
, an IRF-1 half-site ; see Fig .
1 ) suggests the possibility that NF-B1 consists of an IRF-1-related protein heterodimer .
The modification of the Blm site appears to have a negative effect on activity , whereas the B2m mutation results in a slight activity increase ( Table 2 ) .
Two downstream deletion constructs shown in Fig .
3B ( constructs 3 and 4 ) support the minimal importance of the B2 site relative to that of Bl .
Like the binding of the NF-IL6 factor , the bindings of NF-B1 and NF-B2 are not significantly affected by stimulation ( not shown ) .
The mutation and deletion data presented here support a preliminary model in which NF-IL6 binds to region E and additional factors bind to regions A through C as well as to regions F through I .
These factors are each necessary , but TABLE 4 .

13 , 1993 insufficient , for gene induction .
Preliminary EMSA analysis suggests that at least three additional factors bind to the B through C region ( not shown ) .
Such interdependence among discrete factors is not novel and has been described for other transcription systems .
In particular , Drouet et al .
( 13a ) have shown that three of four cooperating NF- « B sites must be eliminated in order to significantly decrease the LPS induction of the murine tumor necrosis factor alpha gene .
Therefore , the mutation of a single binding site for genes requiring multiple transcription factor associations is not necessarily sufficient for inactivation .
A screening of the distribution of the three DNA-binding factors mentioned above has been initiated by using the EMSA probes described in this study to test for binding in nuclear extracts prepared from IL-l-treated human primary dermal fibroblasts , PMA-treated HeLa cells , and untreated COS cells ( 40 ) .
As a result , it appears as though NF-B2-like factors are abundant in all these cell types , whereas NF-B1 could not be detected in any of them .
Like NF-B2 , NF-IL6-like factors ( as judged by specific binding to an IL6/I probe ) are present in all of the cells used , although the abundance in HeLa and COS cells appeared to be significantly less than in fibroblasts .
The presence of NF-IL6/I-binding factors in all of these cells is consistent with the expression of the P ; Xho/fos construct in HeLa cells ( Table 4 ) .
The apparent lack of NF-B1-like binding in any of the cells tested suggests that this factor may not be essential for proIL-1B gene induction in IL-l-treated fibroblasts or PMA-treated HeLa cells .
The IL-1 transcriptional response profile fits well with induction by other well-known transcription factors such as AP-1 , CREB , and NF-kB .
A search of the sequence in the vicinity of the upstream regulatory region suggests the presence of several sequence motifs which may serve as binding sites for such factors ( Fig .
1 ) .
Specific internal deletions at these sites will be required to establish the exact role of each of these factors .
We had previously reported that the prolIL-1B gene promoter is contained within 131 residues of the transcription start site ( 47 ) , is highly conserved between human and mouse sequences ( 8 ) , and binds a protein present in cells competent for prolL-1B gene transcription ( 3 , 8 , 24 ) .
This protein , which we have designated as NF-BA ( 24 ) , binds to a conserved sequence ( ACTTCTGCTTTT ) found at the identical location in the human and mouse genes ( -49 to -38 ) and is expressed constitutively in competent cells but is not expressed in refractory cells such as T cells and HeLa cells .
It is not yet clear that NF-BA is responsible for the observed tissue specificity , since a recognition sequence for a factor with appropriate tissue specificity , the hematopoi-etic transcription factor Spi-1 ( equivalent to factor B1 in [ 19 ] ) , also is contained within the 131 residues of upstream promoter-proximal sequence as well as a recently reported binding site for NF-IL6 ( 35 ) .
We have recently demonstrated an involvement of this part of the proIL-1f gene sequence in the trans activation of this gene by the IE1l immediate-early gene product of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) , thus explaining the strong effect of HCMV infection on the induction of IL-1 ( 26 ) .
The fact that HCMV IEl trans activation is enhanced in the presence of LPS ( 10 ) suggests an additional complexity to the nature of proIL-1B gene regulation .
