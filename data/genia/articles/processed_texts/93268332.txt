6 Regulation of the Interleukin-1B ( IL-1B ) Gene by Mycobacterial Components and Lipopolysaccharide Is Mediated by Two Nuclear Factor-IL6 Motifs YIHONG ZHANG anp WILLIAM N. ROM* Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine , Departments of Medicine and Environmental Medicine , and Chest Service , Bellevue Hospital Center , New York University Medical Center , 550 First Avenue , New York , New York 10016 Received 2 December 1992/Returned for modification 6 January 1993/Accepted 8 March 1993 The cytokines interleukin-16 ( IL-1B ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha are released by mononuclear phagocytes in vitro after stimulation with mycobacteria and are considered to mediate pathophysiologic events , including granuloma formation and systemic symptoms .
We demonstrated that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall component lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) is a very potent inducer of IL-1B gene expression in human monocytes and investigated the mechanism of this effect .
We localized the LAM- , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - , and TNF-c-inducible promoter activity to a -131/+15 ( positions -131 to +15 ) DNA fragment of the IL-1B gene by deletion analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay .
Within this DNA fragment , there were two novel 9-bp motifs ( -90/-82 and -40/-32 ) with high homology to the nuclear factor-IL6 ( NF-IL6 ) binding site .
Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the two NF-IL-6 motifs could be independently activated by LAM , LPS , or TNF-a and that they acted in an orientation-independent manner .
DNA mobility shift assay revealed specific binding of nuclear protein ( s ) from LAM- , LPS- , or TNF-o-stimulated THP-1 cells to the NF-IL6 motifs .
We conclude that the two NF-IL6 sites mediate induction of IL-1§ in response to the stimuli LAM , LPS , and TNF- « .
Tuberculosis is characterized by granuloma formation with caseation necrosis and systemic symptoms of weight loss , fever , and night sweats ( 8 ) .
Animal models demonstrate cytokines in the granulomas , and in vitro experiments with mononuclear phagocytes have established that Mycobacterium tuberculosis stimulates the release of cytokines ( 5 , 6 , 25 , 33 , 40 , 41 ) .
Interleukin-1B ( IL-1B ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) are the two major inflammatory mediators released in vitro by mycobacteria ( 5 , 13 ) .
IL-1 $ is chemotactic for lymphocytes and can activate CD4* helper-inducer T lymphocytes , causing them to proliferate and release gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) ( 22 ) .
IL-1 and IFN-y stimulate macrophages to release TNF- « , which can also stimulate the release of IL-1B ( 28 , 35 ) .
Studies of recombinant IL-1 impregnated in ethyl vinyl disks revealed that IL-1 could directly induce a granulomatous response in juxtaposition to the implanted disks ( 17 , 27 ) .
Pulmonary granulomas induced in mice by the intratracheal injection of antigen-coated beads were excised , and aqueous extracts of the granulomata contained high levels of IL-1 ( 26 ) .
Studies by Kunkel and colleagues demonstrated that IL-1f is the dominant cytokine in early schistosomal granuloma develop-ment , followed temporally by TNF-a ( 27 ) .
Thus , IL-1 may be more important to the early cellular recruitment of inflammatory cells and their activation , while TNF-a may contribute to the continued organization of the mature granulomatous lesion .
Activation of the IL-1B gene is achieved by a number of stimuli , including lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) from gram-negative bacteria , phorbol esters , silica , and other bacterial products ( 18 , 30 , 36 , 43 ) .
Although mycobacteria do not possess LPS , the cell wall of M. tuberculosis contains a complex lipid glycoprotein * Corresponding author .
3831 called lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) which shares many phys-icochemical properties with LPS ( 5 , 12 ) .
The cell wall backbone of LAM is complemented by phenolic glycolipids , mycolic acids , arabinogalactan , peptidoglycan , and manno-phosphoinositides .
However , the most antigenic and consequently biologically active component is LAM ( 10 ) .
In addition to stimulating cytokine release , LAM inhibits IFN-y activation of macrophages and protein-antigen processing by antigen-presenting cells and can suppress T-lym-phocyte proliferation in vitro in response to mitogens and specific antigens ( 5 , 32 , 39 ) .
Barnes and colleagues demonstrated that the phosphoinositol component anchoring LAM to the cell wall was critical for LAM 's ability to stimulate cytokine release , because a deacylated LAM lacking this component was unable to stimulate cytokine mRNA expression ( 5 ) .
In addition , Chatterjee and colleagues demonstrated that LAM from the attenuated strain H37Ra stimulated significantly more TNF-a in vitro from murine peritoneal or bone marrow macrophages than LAM from the more virulent Erdman strain ( 12 ) .
The LAM from the Erdman strain was shown to have mannose moieties capping the arabinan side chains , in contrast to the LAM from strain H37Ra ( 11 ) .
In order to further dissect the host immune response to tuberculosis , we have studied the mechanism of cytokine gene regulation in mononuclear phagocyte cells after stimulation with the M. tuberculosis component , the purified cell wall , LAM .
We isolated a 1.145-kb fragment of the 5 IL-18B genomic DNA and evaluated the responsiveness of this fragment to stimulation with LAM and LPS .
Interestingly , two copies of nuclear factor-IL6 ( NF-IL6 ) binding sites were the major cis-acting elements for stimulation with LAM , LPS , or TNF-a , as demonstrated by deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis studies .
In addition , the binding of nuclear proteins to the NF-IL6 site was enhanced by these stimuli .

THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMs ) from purified protein derivative-negative healthy volunteers were isolated by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque ( Flow Laboratories ) , washed , and seeded onto the plastic surface of a 175-cm* flask in RPMI 1640 with 10 % fetal bovine serum for 2 h at 37°C .
The flask was washed three times with RPMI 1640 to remove nonadherent cells , and the monocyte-enriched population ( > 90 % PBMs ) was detached by scraping with a rubber policeman .

Human PBMs were stimulated for 5 h , collected by centrifugation , and lysed by addition of 5.5 M guanidinium isothiocyanate buffer .
Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated through CsCl ; gradient ultracentrifugation .
Equal amounts of the extracted RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1 % agar-ose-6 % formaldehyde denaturing gel , transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter ( BA 85 ; Schleicher and Schuell ) , and baked at 80°C for 2 h. The baked filter was incubated in 40 ml of prehybridization solution { 50 % formamide , 0.5 % SDS , 10x Denhardt 's solution , 2.5 % herring sperm DNA , and 4 % SSPE [ 1x SSPE is 0.18 M NaCl , 10 mM NaPO , , and 1 mM EDTA ( pH 7.7 ) ] } at 42°C for 6 to 12 h. An IL-1B cDNA probe ( S. Gillis , Immunex , Seattle , Wash. ) , a TNF- « cDNA probe ( Genentech , South San Francisco , Calif. ) , and a pHe7 cDNA probe were radiolabeled with [ a- `` °P ] dCTP ( specific activity , 3,000 Ci/mmol ; New England Nuclear ) by nick translation .

Transient transfection of human suspension cultures and assay of CAT activity .
THP-1 cells were transfected with serially constructed plasmids by the DEAE-dextran method ( 19 ) .
Briefly , 10 `` cells were washed in STBS solution ( 25 mM Tris [ pH 7.4 } , 137 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 0.6 mM Na , HPO , , 0.7 mM CaCl , , 0.5 mM MgC1 ; ) and were transfected with 10 ug of CsCl , -purified plasmids in 1 ml of STBS solution containing 500 pg of DEAE-dextran per ml at 37°C for 90 min .
The transfected cells were then washed with STBS solution and incubated in complete medium for 24 h in the absence or presence of inducing agents .
The transfected cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing , and equal amounts of protein from different cell extracts were assayed for CAT activity ( 21 ) .
The protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad reagents .
For the CAT assay , 100 ug of protein was incubated with 0.1 wCi of [ '*C ) chloramphenicol-250 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) -360 ug of acetyl coenzyme A per ml in a total volume of 170 pl at 37°C for 5 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of cold ethyl acetate .
After extraction with ethyl acetate , the upper layer was saved , dried , and spotted onto a thin-layer chromatography plate .
After being developed in organic solution ( 95 % chloroform and 5 % methanol ) , the plate was air-dried and exposed to X-ray film .
Preparation of nuclear extracts and DNA mobility shift assay .
Cell extracts were prepared from THP -1 cells by using the method first described by Dignam et al .

The nuclei were washed with buffer A once .
The nuclear proteins were extracted in buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 25 % glycerol , 0.42 M NaCl , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) on ice for 30 min with shaking .
The extracted nuclear proteins were dialyzed against buffer D ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 20 % glycerol , 0.1 M KCl , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) for 5 h and were frozen in liquid nitrogen in aliquots .

Human PBMs were isolated as described in Materials and Methods and were stimulated for 5 h with the following stimuli ( by lane ) : 2 , TNF-a ( 10 pg/ml ) ; 3 , LAM ( 100 ng/ml ) ; 4 , HSP-65kD ( 100 ng/ml ) ; 5 , culture filtrate ( 100 ng/ml ) .

Equal amounts of total RNA were placed in each lane , as demonstrated by the pHe7 housekeeping gene ( Fig .

The LAM and HSP-65kD were similar in their stimulation of IL-18 and TNF-a mRNA ; in contrast , the culture filtrate from the Erdman strain of M. tuberculosis was less potent .
All three stimuli were evaluated for LPS contamination by the amebocyte lysate assay and were found to contain < 5 pg/ug of test reagent in the several lots tested .
Analysis of IL-1B promoter region by deletion analysis .
In order to investigate the molecular mechanism involved in the activation of IL-1B gene expression , we initiated experiments aimed at the identification of DNA sequences responsible for the regulation of the gene by LAM , LPS , or TNF-a .
A 1,145-bp IL-1B DNA fragment ( -1130/+15 ) was isolated from a human genomic library and cloned into the pTK ( - ) .CAT plasmid .
This DNA fragment contains several sequences resembling known regulatory elements , as schematically illustrated in Fig .
2 .
To identify cis-acting elements responsive to LAM , LPS , or TNF- « , four IL-1B DNA fragments with deletions from the 5° end were fused to the CAT reporter gene .
Activation of the IL-1B promoter region was determined by measuring CAT activities in THP-1 cells transfected with these constructs after stimulation with the different reagents .
Our results showed that CAT activity gradually increased as deletion advanced from positions -1130 to -313 and to -131 ( Fig .
3 ) .
After further deletion to position -69 , which resulted in the removal of a sequence ( -90/-82 ) that shared high homology with the NF-IL6 binding site , there was only one-half to three-fourths the increase in CAT activity over that of the control after stimulation .
The data suggest that major positive regulating elements on the IL-1B gene in response to stimulation by LAM , LPS , or TNF-a are located IL-18 GENE REGULATION BY NF-IL6 MOTIFS 3833 4 NF-kB __ NF-IL-6 | °9° I | -1 I-h-H-t= -- -s lapa _ | SRE TATA ~318 -- -- -- -- -- - } - i415 131 -- -- f-+15 -69 -- - +15 FIG .

Summary of deletion analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-1B gene .
Serial deletion mutants of the IL-1B DNA ( -1130/+15 ) were created by using several restriction endonu-cleases and were cloned into the polylinker sites of plasmid pTK ( - ) .CAT as described in Materials and Methods .
Abbrevia-tions : SRE , serum response element ; AP-1 , activating protein 1 ; NF-kB , binding site for nuclear binding protein « B ; NF-IL6 , binding sites for nuclear binding protein ( s ) to the IL-6 gene ; OCTA , octamer binding site .
p } -1130 1 between positions -131 and +15 because removal of the fragment ( -1130/-131 ) did not decrease CAT activity .
CAT activity actually increased after deletion of this fragment .
This phenomenon may be due to derepression by removal of some negative regulatory element ( s ) within this DNA fragment ( -1130/-131 ) .
Interestingly , the increase in CAT activity of stimulated versus unstimulated cells after deletion from positions -131 to -69 actually was smaller , strongly suggesting that a positive regulatory element or elements existed between positions -131 and -69 ( Fig .
3 ) .
Finally , the 84-bp DNA fragment from positions -69 to +15 still showed a significant increase in CAT activity after stimulation , suggesting that this 84-bp-long DNA sequence also contains a positive regulatory element or elements in response to LAM , LPS , or TNF-a .
LAM , LPS , and TNF- « have common positive regulatory elements .
There are two sequences on IL-1f that share the NF-IL-6 consensus sequence T ( T/G ) NNGNAA ( T/G ) ( 31 ) .
They are 5-TTGTGAAAT-3 ' ( -90/-82 ) and 5'-TTITTGAA AG-3 ' ( -40/-32 ) .
To test whether the two sequences are the positive regulatory element ( s ) , we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the IL-1B DNA fragment ( Fig .

Analysis of the IL-18 promoter region by site-directed mutagenesis .
Three plasmids constructed with one NF-IL6 mutation or double NF-IL6 site mutations were tested by transient transfection and CAT assays in THP-1 cells as shown on the top .
The boxes labeled X represent the mutated NF-IL6 motifs , and the fold increase over control ( C ) activity is given below each lane .
mutations were made as follows : ( i ) the NF-IL6 sequence ( -90/-82 ) was mutated to 5'-CCGTAAAAG-3 ' ; ( ii ) the second NF-IL6 sequence ( -40/-32 ) was mutated to 5'-CCT TAAAAG-3 ' .
Three kinds of mutations were carried out by mutating either one of the NF-IL6-like sites and leaving the other one intact and mutating both NF-IL6-like sites .
The mutants were sequenced to confirm the correct mutation .
Induction of CAT activity by LAM , LPS , or TNF-a was striking , with mutation of the 5° NF-IL6 site leaving the 3 ' site intact ( Fig .
4 , left panel ) or mutation of the 3 ' NF-IL6 site leaving the 5° NF-IL6 site intact ( Fig .
4 , middle panel ) .
After mutation of both NF-IL6 sites , inducibility of the IL-1 promoter by LAM , LPS , or TNF-a was abolished ( Fig .
4 , right panel ) .
The inducibility of CAT activity on the wild-type -131/+15 DNA fragment is shown in Fig .
3 .
These experiments suggested that the two NF-IL6 sites on the IL-1B gene functioned as positive regulatory sequences in response to the induction with LAM , LPS , or TNF- « .
Each of the NF-IL6 sites functioned independently of the other because a single mutation did not affect CAT activity .
NF-IL6 motifs on the IL-1B gene act in an orientation-independent manner .
Experiments were conducted with the DNA fragments containing the 5° NF-IL6 or 3 ' NF-IL6 motifs subcloned into the polylinker sites of the plasmid pTK.CAT in either orientation .
THP-1 cells were transfected with these constructs and were stimulated with LAM , LPS , or TNF-a as described above .
Stimulation of the -131/-69 fragment ( containing the -90/-82 NF-IL6 site ) with any of the stimuli revealed enhanced CAT activity with either orientation of the DNA fragment ( Fig .
5 , left and middle panels ) .
There was no CAT activity induced after stimulation of the pTK ( - ) .CAT plasmid vector alone ( Fig .
5 , right panel ) .
Similar results were obtained with a -68/-31 DNA fragment containing the 3 ' NF-IL6 site ( -40/-32 ) .
Enhanced CAT activity was observed after any of the stimuli with the DNA fragment in either orientation ( Fig .
6 , left and middle panels ) , and no CAT activity was induced after stimulation of the pTK.CAT plasmid vector alone ( Fig .

Induction of the binding of nuclear protein ( s ) to the 5 NF-IL6 sequence as analyzed by DNA mobility shift assay .
Stimulated THP-1 cell nuclear extracts were incubated with *P- end-labeled synthetic 5° NF-IL6 probe ( 10,000 cpm ) in the absence or presence of competitors under the binding conditions described in Materials and Methods .
Lanes : 1 , 5 , and 9 , unstimulated nuclear extracts ; 2 , 6 , and 10 , LAM- , LPS- , and TNF-a-stimulated nuclear extracts , respectively ; 3 , 7 , and 11 , LAM- , LPS- , and TNF- « -stimulated nuclear extracts , respectively , in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled synthetic mutant NF-IL6 se-quence ; 4 , 8 , and 12 , LAM- , LPS- , and TNF-o-stimulated nuclear extracts , respectively , in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled synthetic wild-type NF-IL6é DNA .
LAM , LPS , or TNF-a « , a dramatically enhanced binding of nuclear protein ( s ) to the 5° NF-IL6 site was observed ( Fig .
7 , lanes 2 , 6 , and 10 , respectively ) .
To test whether the binding was specific , competition experiments were carried out with a 100-fold molar excess of cold wild-type or mutated NF-IL6 probe .
The protein-DNA interaction was still present after competition experiments with a 100-fold molar excess of cold mutated NF-IL6 probe ( Fig .
7 , lanes 3 , 7 , and 11 ) .
However , binding of nuclear protein ( s ) to the NF-IL6 site was abolished by competition performed with 100-fold excess cold wild-type NF-IL6 probe ( Fig .
7 , lanes 4 , 8 , and 12 ) after stimulation by LAM , LPS , or TNF-a , respectively .
Similar results were obtained by using end-labeled 3 ' NF-IL6 probe ( Fig .
8 , same lanes as in Fig .
7 ) .
These data strongly suggested that LAM , LPS , or TNF-a activated the IL-1B gene by enhancing the interaction between the NF-IL6 sequence and its binding protein ( s ) .
DISCUSSION IL-1B appears to be an important cytokine in the host response to M. tuberculosis in that large quantities can be released in vitro after stimulation of mononuclear phagocytes ( 5 , 13 , 41 ) .
We demonstrated that LAM can increase the IL-1B and TNF- « mRNA level in PBMs , and this increase was greater than the increase elicited by a LAM-free culture filtrate from the Erdman strain .

protein was equipotent compared with LAM in stimulating IL-18 and TNF-a gene expression and is a cytosolic protein important for protein assembly , folding , and transport ( 38 ) .
Interestingly , LAM was the most potent stimulus of IL-1B mRNA , followed by HSP-65kD , TNF-a , and the culture filtrate .
Because LAM also stimulates TNF- « protein and mRNA , the release of TNF- « could amplify the stimulus for IL-18 .
We concentrated on investigating the mechanism by which IL-1B gene expression is regulated by the mycobacterial cell wall component LAM at the level of transcription .
By comparing the action of LAM to that of LPS , we showed that both LAM and LPS activate the IL-1B gene through NF-IL6 binding sequences that function as positive regulatory elements .
TNF-a , a well-known activator of the IL-1B gene , shared a similar mechanism with LAM or LPS in IL-1B gene activation in human myelomonocytic THP-1 cells ( 28 ) .
The two NF-IL6 sites functioned independently in response to LAM , LPS , or TNF- « stimulation because mutation of either of them did not interfere with the function of the other .
An NF-KB site located at fragment -295/-286 can be activated by a variety of stimuli , including LPS , TNF- « , and IL-1 , and very likely LAM , because LAM activated NF- « B independently on the IL-6 gene ( 44 ) .
LAM or LPS induced nuclear proteins that bound to the NF-IL6 wild-type target sequence specifically , as demonstrated by the DNA mobility shift assay .
These results suggest that binding of the LAM- , LPS- , or TNF-a « -induced transcription factors to the NF-IL6 sites contributed to the transcriptional activation of the IL-1B gene .
In both gel mobility shift assays with 5'- and 3'-end-labeled NF-IL6 probes , the stimulated nuclear proteins were shown to compete with wild-type NF-IL6 , and the TNF-a « -stimulated nuclear proteins acted similarly , as shown in Fig .
8 .
This report also demonstrates that LPS from gram-negative bacteria and LAM from mycobacteria function through similar mechanisms : they both activate NF-IL6 elements on the IL-1B gene .
Thus , the NF-IL6 sequence may be an important mycobacterial or bacterial response element and may be relevant to other host cytokines ( 1 , 23 ) .
In fact , we have demonstrated that LAM activates NF-IL6 sites on the IL-6 gene and enhances interactions between nuclear proteins and the NF-IL6 element ( 44 ) .
The IL-18 gene spans a region of 7.5 kb with a coding region divided into seven exons ( 4 , 7 , 31 ) .
Although there are 3836 ZHANG AND ROM two forms of IL-1 ( IL-l « and IL-1B ) encoded by two separate genes with only 26 % similarity in their amino acid sequences and 45 % similarity in their nucleotide sequences , they bind to the same cell surface receptors and have overlapping biological activities ( 1 , 4 , 7 , 14 , 31 ) .
Interestingly , IL-l « has two NF-IL6 motifs as well ( located at -199/191 and -147/-139 ) and an NF- « B ( -749/-740 ) site ( 20 ) .
Pro-IL-1B is an inactive 31-kDa precursor that is cleaved by IL-1B-converting enzyme between Asp-116 and Ala-117 , releasing the 153 COOH-terminal amino acids that constitute the mature cytokine ( 4 , 9 , 31 ) .
Previous investigators have reported that LPS and the immediate-early genes of human cytomegalovirus ( CMV IE ) activated promoter/enhancer elements on the 5'-flanking region of IL-1B and that progressive deletions of a -1,097/ +14 sequence localized CMV IE-responsive elements to a -131/+14 DNA fragment similar to the one we isolated ( 15 , 24 ) .
Crump and colleagues described a 15-fold increase in CAT activity with this fragment after cotransfection in THP-1 cells with a plasmid containing the CMV IE1 gene ( 15 ) .
In this regard , the sequence between positions -131 and +15 is an important positive regulatory element on the IL-18B gene and the two NF-IL6 motifs may contribute to the promoter activity within this region .
IL-1B mRNA in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) -infected mononuclear phagocytes increases 8- to 15-fold after LPS stimulation in comparison with non-HIV-l-infected cells that were similarly stimulated , suggesting synergism in transcriptional activation by the two stimuli ( 42 ) .
HIV-1 tat , a major regulatory protein of HIV-1 , may be the mediator of these effects .
The NF for IL-6 expression ( NF-IL6 ) has been cloned , and the full-length cDNA encodes a 345-amino-acid protein whose C-terminal portion reveals a high degree of homology to the C/EBP family of liver-specific transcriptional factors ( 2 , 3 ) .
Also , NF-IL6 binds to transcriptional regulatory regions in TNF- « , IL-8 , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor , suggesting a role for NF-IL6 in inflammation and the acute phase response .
Under Northern blot analysis , a variety of tissues , especially lung , expressed NF-IL6 mRNA after LPS stimulation , and this pattern correlated with IL-6 induction .
The best fit for a consensus sequence for NF-IL6 among species was found , and the C/EBP family was T ( T/ G ) NNGNAA ( T/G ) ( 2 ) .
Using the NF-IL6 cDNA clone from Akira and colleagues ( 2 ) , we did not detect this specific mRNA in stimulated THP-1 cells , consistent with the concept that there is a family of nuclear binding proteins that bind to the NF-IL6 consensus sequence .
The proteins NF- « B-p50 and NF-IL6 may interact by using common leucine zipper motifs to enhance transcription of cytokine and other genes involved in inflammation ( 29 ) .
As macrophages differentiated to more mature forms , there was a striking increase in NF-IL6 expression ( 34 ) .
Thus , we propose that LAM from M. tuberculosis activates NF-IL6 , triggering a cytokine cascade of IL-1B , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF- « release attracting macrophages , lymphocytes , and neutrophils to sites of in-flammation ; stimulating cell-cell adhesion ; and differentiating macrophages into the epithelioid and Langerhans giant cells forming a typical granuloma .
Macrophages are major participants in immune defense against M. tuberculosis ( 5 , 8 , 10 , 13 , 40 ) .
Cytokines produced by macrophages play important roles in manifestations and pathological events of tuberculosis , especially granuloma formation and systemic symptoms .
To understand the mechanism ( s ) of how the expression of these Mor .

cytokine genes is regulated is important for future efforts to modulate the host 's response to M. tuberculosis infection .
