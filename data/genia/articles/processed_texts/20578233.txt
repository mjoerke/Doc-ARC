Strict Control of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Replication by a Genetic Switch : Tet for Tat KOEN VERHOEF , ' { GIUSEPPE MARZIO , !
WOLFGANG HILLEN , * HERMANN BUJARD , * Anp BEN BERKHOUT'* Department of Human Retrovirology , Academic Medical Center , University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands , `` and Friedrich-Alexander University , Erlangen , `` and Zentrum fiir Molekulare Biologie , University of Heidelberg , Heidelberg , * Germany Received 25 July 2000/Accepted 11 October 2000 Live-attenuated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) variants have shown great promise as AIDS vaccines , but continued replication can lead to the selection of faster-replicating variants that are pathogenic .
We therefore designed HIV-1 genomes that replicate exclusively upon addition of the nontoxic effector doxycycline ( dox ) .
This was achieved by replacement of the viral TAR-Tat system for transcriptional activation by the Escherichia coli-derived Tet system for inducible gene expression .
These designer `` HIV-rtTA `` viruses replicate in a strictly dox-dependent manner both in a T-cell line and in primary blood cells , and the rate of replication can be fine-tuned by simple variation of the dox concentration .
These HIV-rtTA viruses provide a tool to perform genetics , e.g .
, selection and optimization experiments , with the E. coli-derived Tet reagents in a eukaryotic background .
Furthermore , such viruses may represent improved vaccine candidates because their replication can be turned on and off at will .
Live-attenuated virus vaccines ( such as vaccinia , polio , and measles viruses ) have been enormously successful and have made a dramatic and historic impact on public health .
Replicating virus vaccines also demonstrated superior performance in AIDS vaccine trials ( 1 , 14 , 32 , 40 , 45 , 46 , 49 , 54 ) .
However , safety concerns remain for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) about either the reversion of attenuated vaccine strains to virulent phenotypes or the induction of fulmi-nant infection in ( immunocompromised ) individuals .
Testifying to the genetic instability of such strains is the recent demonstration that the HIV-1 A3 vaccine candidate , which contains three deletions in nonessential parts of the genome , is able to regain full replication capacity within 4 months of replication in tissue culture ( 11 ) .
It has also been reported that the viral load of attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) variants increased after several years in some infected monkeys , concomitant with the onset of AIDS ( 2 ) .
Furthermore , although there is some evidence that attenuated HIV-1 variants lacking the nef gene result in a benign course of infection in humans ( 17 ) , a decline in CD4* T-cell numbers has been reported recently for some of these individuals , which is an early sign that these persons could develop AIDS ( 20 , 25 ) .
To improve the safety of potential HIV-1 vaccine strains , we designed an HIV-1 variant for which replication depends on the addition of the nontoxic , selective effector doxycycline ( dox ) .
This was done by incorporation of the Tet system for inducible gene expression ( 5 , 23 , 24 ) into the viral genome .
This system is based on two elements from the Escherichia coli tet operon , the tetracycline-inducible repressor protein ( TetR ) * Corresponding author .

979 that has been converted into a eukaryotic transcriptional activator ( tTA or rtTA ) , and the fetO operator DNA sequence .
The Tet system has found wide application and allows strict and graded regulation of gene expression in many experimental setups , for example , in the breeding of transgenic animals and in gene therapy approaches .
The Tet system has been successfully used to regulate the expression of transgenes in a variety of viral vector systems , including lentiviral vectors .
We now report a completely novel strategy to impose control over HIV-1 replication by replacement of the viral frams-activator protein Tat and its binding site TAR by the two components of the Tet system , such that an exogenous agent ( dox ) can be used to turn virus replication on in a reversible manner .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of the HIV-rtTA molecular clones .
The following primers were used in mutagenesis and cloning : BglIINef ( 5'-AGCTGTAGATCTTAGCCAC-3 ' , sense ) , deltaU3 TAGAGTGGAGGT-3 ' , sense ) , Sp6BspEI ( 5'-A4TTTAGGTGACACTATAGGT ACTCCGGATGCAGCTCTCG-3 ' , antisense ) , TARBI23L13 ( 5 `` -CCAGAGA GCTCCAATGCTCCTTTCTGGTCTAACCAGAGAGACC-3 ' , antisense ) , XemldeltaNef ( 5 % -GCTTGGAAAGGATTITTGCTATAACCATGTCTAGACT GG-deletion-CCAGTCACACCTCAGGTACC-3 ' , sense ) , BamHIEny ( 5 `` -GAA CTAGTGGATCCTTAGCACTTATC-3 ' , sense ) , Smalanti-Nef ( 5-TCCCCCG GGGTGGCTAAGATCTACAGCTGC-3 ' , antisense ) , Anti-UBatt ( 5'-GGAGT GAATTAGCCCTTCCA-3 ' , antisense ) , SallSpl TACAA-deletion-GTCGACAGGGAGGCGTGGCCTG-3 ' , sense ) , xBSallSpl sense ) , Spéanti-lue ( 55-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGGCAGTTGCTCTCCAGC GGTTCC-3 ' , antisense ) , KB12- ( 5-CTGGAAAGTCCCCAGCGGAAAGTC CCIT-3 ' , antisense ) , M13reverse ( 5'-AGGAAACAGCTATGACCAT-3 ' , sense ) , and ExtN4Not ( 5-NNCGCCGGCGACTCAAGGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGCT TAAG-3 ' , antisense ) .
Changes compared with the sequence of LAI are marked as follows : insertions are underlined , substitutions are in boldface , deletions are denoted as such , and non-template 5 ' extensions are shown in italics .
The following tetO motif was used : 5'-CTCGAGTTTACCACTCCCTATCA GTGATAGAGAAAAGTGAAAGTCGAC-3 ' and 3'-GAGCTCAAATGGTG AGGGATAGTCACTATCTCTTTTCACTTTCAGCTG-5 ' .
The sequence of a single fefO double-stranded DNA site is shown ( underlined ) , flanked by XhoI and Sall restriction sites .
The dimeric , tetrameric , and hexameric fefO linkers 980 VERHOEF ET AL .
were generated by Xhol/Sall digestion and subsequent ligation of the compatible sticky ends .
Because ligation of the Xhol/Sa/lI sticky ends does not reform these restriction enzyme sites , the multimerized head-to-tail fefO elements could be cloned as Xhol/Sall fragments in pBluescript II SK ( + ) ( R. Loew , personal communication ) .
We used standard DNA cloning and amplification methods ( 41 ) , and all mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing using ET Dyeprimer technology ( Amersham ) on an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer .
The stepwise cloning procedure was as follows .
Cloning .
( i ) Introduction of a Sa/l site and deletion of NF- < B elements in the HIV-1 LTR promoter .
To facilitate the introduction of tefO operator elements in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) promoter , a Sall restriction site was introduced immediately upstream of the Sp1 sites .
A mutagenesis PCR ( 42 ) was done on pBlue3'LTR-luc ( 31 ) with one of the mutagenic primers ( xBSallSp1 or SallSp1 [ primer MJ ) and the general primers M13reverse ( primer 1 ) , ExtN4Not ( primer 2 ) , and Sp6anti-lue ( primer 3 ) .
After we performed separate PCR reactions with primer sets 1+2 and M+3 , the PCR products were purified from a gel and used as templates in a final PCR with primer set 1+3 .
The PCR products from the final reactions were digested with Xhol and HindIII and used to replace the corresponding fragments in the pBlue3'LTR-luc construct , thereby generating plasmids pBlue3'LTR-lue- « kBSallSp1 ( K promoter ) and pBlue3'LTR-lue-SallSp1 ( S promoter ; NF-xB sequences deleted ) .
( ii ) Introduction of fefO elements in the HIV-1 LTR promoter .
The pBlue3'LTR-luc-kBSallSp1 and pBlue3'LTR-lue-SallSp1 constructs were linearized by Sall digestion .
The 2-mer , 4-mer , and 6-mer tefO repeats were isolated from the pBluescript backbone through digestion with XhoI and SalI and then ligated into the linearized luciferase reporter construct .
Clones were selected in which the operator sequences are present in the sense orientation .
We thus generated LTR -luc constructs containing 2 , 4 , and 6 tefO element repeats placed between the NF-kB and Sp1 binding sites ( xB-2xtetO-Sp1/ « kB-4xtetO-Sp1/kB-6xtetO-Sp1 ) and a similar set of reporter constructs in which both NF-xB elements are deleted ( 2xtetO-Sp1/4xtetO-Sp1/6xtetO-Sp1 ) .
Fortuitously , we isolated a clone in which two tetrameric fefO repeats were ligated in tandem , yielding a promoter with eight fefO elements between the NF-kB and Sp1 sites ( B-8xtetO-Sp1 ) .
( iii ) Inactivation of the TAR RNA element .
Mutation of the TAR bulge and loop sequences was performed in a PCR on the pBlue3'LTR-lue plasmid ( 31 ) with the primers xBSallSp1 and TARB123L13 .
The PCR product was cut with Sall and Sacl and exchanged with the homologous fragment from the xB-SxtetO-Sp1 and 6xtetO-Sp1 LTR-luc constructs .
This procedure generated plasmids pBlue3'LTR-luc-kB-8xtetO-Sp1TAR* ( pBlue3'LTR-lucK8TAR* ) and pBlue3'LTR-luc-6xtetO-Sp1TAR* ( pBlue3'LTR-lucS6TAR* ) .
( iv ) Construction of a Nef-3'LTR shuttle vector .
To facilitate the modification of the 3 ' end of the HIV-1 genome , we constructed a shuttle vector to exchange Nef-3'LTR sequences with the full-length HIV-1 infectious clone pLAI ( 43 ) .
To this end , pLAI was cut with BamHI and Bg/I enzymes , and the resulting 2.3-kb fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites of pBluescript KS ( + ) , generating plasmid pBlue3'LTRext .
( v ) Deletion of U3 sequences .
Mutagenesis PCRs ( 42 ) were performed on pBlue3'LTRext with mutagenic primer deltaU3 ( primer M ) and general primers BgiIINef ( primer 1 ) , Sp6BspEI ( primer 2 ) , and KB12- ( primer 3 ) .
Separate PCRs were performed with primer sets 1+2 and M+3 , after which the products were purified from a gel and used as templates in a final PCR with primer set 1+3 .
The resulting PCR product was digested with Bg/II and BspEI and used to replace the corresponding fragment of plasmid pBlue3'LTRext , generating pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3 .
( vi ) Deletion of nef sequences and introduction of an XerI site .
A mutagenesis PCR ( 42 ) was performed on pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3 with mutagenic primer XemlIdeltaNef ( primer M ) and general primers BamHIEny ( primer 1 ) , Smalanti-Nef ( primer 2 ) , and Anti-U3att ( primer 3 ) .
Separate PCRs were performed with primer sets 1+2 and M+3 , after which the PCR products were purified from a gel and used as templates in a final PCR with primer set 1+3 .
The resulting PCR product was used to replace wild-type nef sequences in the pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3 construct through the Spel ( vector-encoded ) and Bg/II sites , generating pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3Xcml .
( vii ) Insertion of the rtTA gene in the nef locus .
The plasmid pUHD 52-1 , containing the novel rtTA-S2 gene ( 48 ) , was cut with XemI and BamHI , and the rtTA gene fragment was ligated into the nef locus via XemI and Bg/II restriction sites in pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3XcmI .
The resulting construct was named pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3rtTA .
( viii ) Introduction of fefO elements and TAR mutations in the 5 ' and 3 ' LTR shuttle vectors .
pBluc3'LTR-lucK8TAR* and pBlue3'LTR-lucS6TAR* were cut with BspEI and HindIII and used to replace the homologous wild-type fragments J. of pBlueS'LTR ( 36 ) and pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3rtTA .
Constructs were named pBlue5'LTRK8TAR*/pBlue5'LTRS6TAR* and pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3rtTA-K8TAR*/pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3rtTA-S6TAR* .
At this step all the desired modifications have been introduced in the 5 ' and 3 ' LTR shuttle vectors , and these modified LTRs can now be introduced in the full-length HIV-1 molecular clone pLAL .
( ix ) Introduction of the Tet system elements in the 5° and 3 ' LTRs of pLAL The constructs pBlueS'LTR-K8TAR* and pBlueS'LTR-S6TAR* were amplified in the methylation-deficient E. coli strain 3902 and cut with Xbel and Clel restriction enzymes .
Unmethylated wild-type pLAI and Tat mutant pLAI Y26A ( 51 ) DNA was cut with these two enzymes , and the U3/R region of the 5 ' LTR of these constructs was replaced by the K8TAR* and S6TAR* fragments , yielding constructs KW , KY , SW , and SY ( `` K `` and `` S `` denote the promoter configuration « B-8xtetO-Sp1-TARB123L13 [ K ] or 6xtetO-Sp1-TARB123L13 [ S ] ; `` W `` and `` Y `` indicate the status of the Tat gene [ W , wild type ; Y , inactive Y26A Tat mutant ] ) .
The rtTA gene and fefO elements were introduced at the 3 ' end of the infectious clones by cutting the KW , KY , SW , and SY constructs with BamHI and Bg/I and replacing this 3 ' LTR fragment by the BamHI/Bg !
I fragments of the pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3rtTA-K8TAR */pBlue3'LTRext-deltaU3rtTA-S6TAR* shuttle vectors , such that identical promoter sequences are present in both the 5 ' and the 3 ' LTRs ( constructs KWK , KYK , SWS , and SYS ) .
Cells and viruses .
The SupT1 T-cell line was grown and transfected by electroporation as described previously ( 3 ) .
Infection of SupT1 cells with the SWS virus was performed by incubating 6 X 10° cells with 2,200 ng of CA-p24 of a SupT1-produced virus stock for 4 h at 37°C .
Subsequently , the cells were washed twice to remove residual dox that was present in the virus stock and split into six different culture wells , after which each culture received the appropriate addi-tives .
In some cultures , dox was added at a final concentration of 1,000 ng/ml ; zidovudine ( AZT ) and saquinavir ( SQV ) were used at 1,000 and 200 nM , re-spectively .
The culturing and transfection by CaPO , precipitation of the adherent C33A cervical carcinoma cell line was as described previously ( 16 ) .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated , cultured , and transfected by electroporation as described earlier ( 3 ) .
At 7 days after transfection , half of the culture medium was replaced by medium containing 2 x 10° freshly stimulated PBMCs .
Virus production in the culture medium was quantitated in a CA-p24 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
RESULTS Construction of HIV-rtTA viruses .
The full-length , infectious HIV-1 molecular clone pLAI was used for construction of an HIV-rtTA virus genome , the transcription of which can be controlled by dox .
The viral transcriptional elements TAR and Tat ( marked red in Fig .
1A ) were replaced by the pro-karyotic tetO-rtTA elements ( green ) .
In total , nine cloning steps were required to construct these putative dox-dependent viral genomes , and all details of the construction are provided in Materials and Methods .
In general , we took a conservative approach with regard to the type of mutations that were introduced in the HIV-1 genome in order to minimize the chance of inactivating important sequences that constitute replication signals .
TAR and Tat inactivation .
The TAR RNA hairpin motif of nascent HIV-1 transcripts is recognized by the viral Tat protein and the cellular cyclin T cofactor ( 19 , 53 ) .
Both TAR and Tat are essential for transcription from the viral LTR promoter and virus replication .
TAR was inactivated by mutation of multiple nucleotides in the single-stranded bulge and loop domains , the binding sites for Tat and cyclin T , respectively ( Fig .
1B ) .
This produces a fully inactive TAR motif because even single point mutations in one of these single-stranded TAR domains have a dramatic effect on LTR transcription and virus replication ( 8 , 9 , 21 ) .
We did not introduce more gross sequence changes or deletions in TAR because this sequence is also essential for virus replication as a repeat-R region during strand transfer of reverse transcription ( 10 ) .
Although we demonstrated previously that the TAR element of the 5 LTR Vor .

Design of dox-dependent HIV-1 variants .
( A ) HIV-1 genome and modifications that were introduced to construct HIV -rtTA .
Details of the nine-step construction are provided in Materials and Methods .
In brief , we inactivated the TAR-Tat transcriptional axis ( marked in red ) , which was replaced by the tetracycline-inducible rerO-rtTA system ( marked in green ) .
Inactivation of TAR and Tat is indicated by crosses through the motifs .
The size of the HIV-rtTA genome is larger than that of HIV-1 ( the maps are not drawn to scale ) .
The RNA genome of HIV-1 LAI is 9,229 nt , and HIV-rtTA is either 9,767 nt ( the SYS and SWS variants ) or 9,875 nt ( KYK and KWK variants ) .
( B ) TAR hairpin structure and inactivating mutations that were introduced in the bulge ( triple-nucleotide substitution ) and in the loop ( two point mutations ) .
This RNA target binds the Tat-cyclin T1 complex during transcriptional activation of the LTR promoter ( 53 ) .
Panel C provides some details of the fefO insertion in the LTR promoter .
The U3 region of the wild-type LTR ( left ) encodes two NF-kB sites ( C ) ) and three Sp1 sites ( 0 ) .
The modified LTR ( right ) contains either six or eight refO operators ( & ) upstream of the Sp1 sites .
The six refO variant ( mutant S ) has no sites , whereas both NF-kB sites are present upstream of the eight rerO operators ( mutant K ) .
The arrow marks the transcription start site at the U3-R border , which also denotes the 5 ' border of the TAR RNA hairpin motif .
is inherited in both LTRs of the viral progeny ( 38 ) , the inactive TAR motif was inserted in both LTRs to minimize the chance of reversion to the wild-type virus by a recombination event .
Inactivation of the Tat protein was accomplished by introduction of the Tyr26Ala point mutation .
This single amino acid change results in a severe loss of Tat transcriptional activity and virus replication ( 51 ) .
The corresponding codon change ( UAU to GCC ) was designed to restrict the likelihood of simple reversion to the wild-type amino acid , which requires at least two nucleotide substitutions ( 50 ) .
It has been suggested that Tat may play additional roles in the replication cycle besides its transcriptional function ( 26 , 28 , 47 ) .
Thus , Tat may facilitate HIV-rtTA replication even in the absence of an intact TAR element , and we therefore also constructed viruses that retained the wild-type fat gene .
These constructs are referred to here as Y ( tyrosine mutant ) and W ( wild-type ) .
rtTA and fefO insertion .
Two deletions were introduced in the 3'-terminal nef gene of the HIV-1 genome to create space for insertion of the components of the Tet system ( Fig .
1A ) .
We removed a 250-nucleotide ( nt ) upstream nef fragment and a 200-nt downstream fragment overlapping the U3 region of the 3 ' LTR .
This U3 deletion will be inherited by the viral progeny in both LTRs .
The exact borders of the nef and U3 deletions were carefully chosen such that important cis-acting sequences for virus replication were not affected .
In particular , we maintained approximately 80 nt around the 5 ' end of the 3 ' LTR ( Fig .
1A ) .
This region encodes multiple sequence elements that are critical for reverse transcription ( 30 ) and integration ( 12 ) .
In fact , we tried to mimic spontaneous deletions that have been observed in the nef-U3 region of several HIV and SIV variants in a variety of replication studies ( 22 , 29 , 33 , 34 ) .
To prepare for the insertion of the exogenous rtTA gene 982 VERHOEF ET AL .

into the position of the nef gene , a short synthetic sequence was inserted that provides a translational start codon ( underlined ) in an optimized sequence context ( CCAUGU [ 39 ] ) and convenient restriction enzyme recognition sites .
We used the novel rtTA-S2 variant with improved properties for insertion in frame with the optimized start codon ( 48 ) .
Thus , rtTA translation should occur from the subgenomic mRNA that was originally meant for expression of the Nef protein .
To identify the optimal configuration of an LTR promoter with rtTA-responsive fefO elements , we performed transient transfection studies with a variety of LTR-luc constructs ( K. Verhoef et al .
, manuscript in preparation ) .
We varied the number of tetO motifs ( 2 , 4 , 6 , or 8 ) that were inserted upstream of the three Sp1 binding sites of the HIV-1 LTR promoter ( Fig .
1C ) .
We also tested constructs with or without the two upstream NF- « kB elements .
The two promoters that provided most robust dox-inducible transcriptional activation were selected for insertion into the HIV-1 genome , and these LTRs are schematically depicted in Fig .
1C .
They will be referred to as the K mutant ( 2 NF-kB + 8 tetO +3 Sp1 sites ) and the S mutant ( 6 tetO +3 Sp1 sites ) .

progeny , we also introduced the fetO motifs in the 5 ' LTR to generate molecular clones of which the initial round of gene expression in transfected cells is also dox dependent .
Thus , both LTRs were modified , and this was done in the wild-type ( W ) and mutant ( Y ) Tat backgrounds , resulting in four HIV-rtTA constructs : KWK , KYK , SWS , and SYS .
All HIV-rtTA molecular clones have the TAR inactivation and rtTA insertion in common , but they differ in the status of the tat gene and the type of fetO insert ( summarized in Table 1 ) .
The virus variant KWXK is most wild type-like because it maintained the NF-B sites and a wild-type Tat protein , and SYS is the most minimal HIV-rtTA version .
HIV-rtTA replicates in a dox-dependent manner .
The four pLAI plasmids were individually transfected into the SupT1 T-cell line to test for their replication capacity .
The culture was maintained at various dox levels , and virus replication was monitored by measuring the amount of CA-p24 produced in the culture medium ( Fig .
2 ) .
In the presence of optimal dox levels ( 1,000 ng/m ! )
, we measured profound replication of all four HIV-rtTA viruses .
No virus replication was observed in the absence of dox , indicating that replication is strictly dependent on the inserted Tet system .
The Tet system is ideally suited to modulate the level of transcriptional activation in a stepwise manner by changing the amount of dox ( 4 ) .
Indeed , replication of the HIV-rtTA viruses can also be modulated at suboptimal concentrations of the inducing dox reagent ( Fig .
2 ) .
A progressive reduction in replication rates of all four rtTA-viruses was observed at 300 and 100 ng of dox per ml , and virus replication was nearly abolished at 30 ng/ml .
The SupT1 cells were killed within 1 week by massive virus-induced syncytia , and the peak CA-p24 production is similar to what we regularly observe in infections with the wild-type LAI 10000000 1000000 { KYK 100000 10000 1 1000 - dox `` a a `` a , .

Nevertheless , the HIV-rtTA variants have significantly reduced replication capacity compared to wild-type HIV-1 ( re-sults not shown ) .
We managed to passage all four HIV-rtTA viruses as cell-free inocula onto fresh , uninfected T cells , and a spreading infection was sustained for at least 5 weeks ( five passages ) .
The combined results of several independent replication assays , either started by transfection or infection , indi- CONDITIONAL HIV-1 REPLICATION _ 983 cated that there are modest but reproducible differences in the replication efficiency of the four HIV-rtTA constructs .
The most efficient replication was measured for the KWK variant that maintained both the NF-KB sites and a functional tat gene , but the other variants were not much delayed .
As expected , the minimal SYS virus replicated most weakly , but this variant also induced a spreading infection .
From these experiments the following ranking order of replication was apparent : LAI ( wild type ) > KWK > KYK , SWS > SYS .
Putative HIV-rtTA vaccine viruses should be able to replicate in primary cells .
The LAI molecular clone used in these studies represents a primary isolate that is able to efficiently infect primary cells ( 43 , 52 ) , but a complication of our design is that we removed the nef gene that contributes to optimal virus replication in primary cells ( 18 ) .
We transfected pooled PBMCs by means of electroporation with the KWK and KYK molecular clones and measured CA-p24 production in the culture supernatant for up to 2 weeks ( Fig .
3 ) .
Both HIV-rtTA variants , with or without a functional tat gene , replicated in the presence of 1,000 ng of dox per ml , whereas no replication was detectable without dox .
These results demonstrate that the HIV-rtTA viruses can replicate in primary cells , despite the absence of the nef function .
Turning virus replication on and off in a reversible manner .
Subsequent tests were performed with the SWS virus in SupT1 infections ( Fig .
4 ) .
First , we repeated the dox response exper-iment .
Efficient virus replication was observed at 1,000 ng of dox per ml , but 100 ng of dox per ml was not sufficient to support a spreading infection in this more sensitive replication 10000000 - 10000000 1000000 | A 1000000 | B e 100000 -e- - dox 100000 -- - dox + 10000 -- + dox ( 100 ) | 10000 -s-+ dox ( day 0 ) i dox ( 1000 ) -o-+ dox ( day 3 ) 3 1000 1000 -2- + GOxt cay & 100 - 100 _-_ , Fea 0 0 5 0 100 as 0 0 § 100 45 CL Ne `` v CO © 1000000 10000000 < 100000 1000000 | D ee O — ’ -s-+ dox -=- + dox 100000 10000 -o- - dox ( day 3 ) | 10000 -o- + dox + SQV : - dOx ( da h —y ) J !

Replication of HIV-rtTA can be turned on and turned off .
These experiments were performed with the SWS virus , but similar experiments have been performed with the other HIV-rtTA variants .

assay ( Fig .
4A ) .
We next analyzed virus replication kinetics when dox was added 3 days after infection of the cells ( Fig .
4B ) .
This resulted in a delay of virus production of approximately 3 days .
In the absence of dox , the HIV-rtTA virus can still infect cells , reverse transcribe its RNA genome , and integrate the DNA into the host genome .
In other words , the provirus form can be established , but replication is blocked at the level of viral transcription .
These latently infected cells will remain present in the culture and can be activated by dox after 3 days to produce new , infectious particles .
A key feature of the Tet system is that it provides reversible regulation .
To test this , SupT1 cells were infected with the SWS virus and cultured in the presence of dox ( Fig .
4C ) .
At day 3 , the cells were washed to remove extracellular dox and resuspended in medium either with or without dox .
Indeed , replication can be stopped abruptly by the removal of dox .
These combined results confirm that replication of the HIV-rtTA virus is absolutely dependent on dox , and the level of virus replication can be strictly controlled in a graded and reversible manner .
Gene expression characteristics of the HIV-rtTA variants .
We next set out to accurately measure the level of gene expression and virus production of the HIV-rtTA variants compared with the wild-type LAI construct .
These experiments were performed by transient transfection of C33 cells , which allows virus production without replication due to the absence of appropriate receptors for virus entry .
The results are summarized in Table 2 .
We measured low virus production for all HIV-rtTA constructs in the absence of dox , ranging from 4,850 to 11,600 pg of CA-p24 per ml .
By comparing the KWK and SWS versus KYK and SYS constructs , it is clear that the wild-type Tat protein makes a modest , twofold contribution to gene expression without dox .
This basal activity is 0.8 to 2.1 % of the virus production measured by the wild-type LAI plasmid , which is an excellent value compared with the `` leakiness `` measured in transient LTR-luc assays ( 7 to 10 % ; results not shown ) .
Profound dox induction was measured for all constructs , ranging from 47- to 120-fold induction over the level of basal activity .
In fact , virus production levels ( 455,000 to J .
580,000 pg of CA-p24 per ml ) are similar to that of LAI , indicating that gene expression and virion production are efficiently executed by the HIV-rtTA variants .
Comparable results were recently presented for SIV constructs with a similarly modified LTR promoter ( 55 ) .
Consistent with the replication ranking order of the HIV-rtTA variants , SYS produced the least amount of virus .
Establishment of an rtTA-fetO autoregulatory loop .
The previous results indicate that gene expression and replication of HIV-rtTA are strictly dependent on dox .
The excellent performance of the HIV-rtTA viruses is novel due , at least in part , to the use of the rtTA-S2 reagent , which was shown to exhibit no measurable basal activity in the uninduced state ( 48 ) .
More-over , we have placed rtTA expression under control of an rtTA-regulated LTR promoter , a situation that mimics the natural autoregulatory loop of the TAR-Tat axis .
This means that both the activity of rtTA and its synthesis are dox dependent .
Thus , only minute amounts of rtTA protein will be present in the absence of dox , resulting in an extremely low basal level of gene expression , and consequently a more-pro-found dox induction .
In other Tet-controlled gene expression systems , the tTA or rtTA protein is produced in a constitutive manner from a second locus , e.g .
, the CMV-rtTA plasmid , which causes a significant level of gene activation in the off state .
We next designed an experiment to critically test whether an autoregulatory loop is established in HIV-rtTA .
We mimicked the regular Tet system by cotransfection of HIV-rtTA with CMV-rtTA .
The latter plasmid will produce a constitutive level of rtTA protein ( even in the absence of dox ) , which is expected to enhance the level of virus production in the uninduced state .
This is indeed what we observed ( Table 2 ) .
The uninduced level of virus production was increased 5- to 10-fold with CMV-rtTA .
The results in Table 2 also indicate that additional synthesis of rtTA protein from the cotransfected CMV-rtTA plasmid does not increase the level of virus production in the presence of dox , indicating that all HIV-rtTA constructs are able to produce saturating amounts of rtTA frans-activator .
Due to increased basal expression levels in cotransfections with CMV-rtTA , we measured only 8- to 16-fold dox induction levels .
In fact , these results are very similar to the results obtained with the corresponding LTR-lue constructs ( K. Verhoef et al .
, manuscript in preparation ) .
These LTR-luc transfection experiments also revealed that higher dox induction levels ( up to 80-fold ) can be obtained in the T-cell line SupT1 .
Although we currently do not understand this effect , the responsiveness of the Tet system has been reported to differ in different cell types ( 27 ) .
We therefore tested all four HIV-rtTA variants in SupT1 cells .
The transfected cells were cultured with or without dox , and virus production was measured at 2 days posttransfection .
The latter point is critical because SupT1 cells support virus replication , which will eventually disturb the transient expression data .
However , we have demonstrated previously that replication does not contribute to virus production measured at day 2 ( 15 ) , and the transient virus production results are summarized in Table 2 .
Indeed , a more profound dox effect was measured in SupT1 cells , an effect ranging from 390- to 3,900-fold induction for the different HIV-rtTA constructs .
These values are somewhat inaccurate because of the extremely low level of virus production in Vor .
75 , 2001 the uninduced state , which hardly exceeds the cutoff value of the CA-p24 assay .
However , it is obvious that dox inducibility is 5- to 10-fold more profound in SupT1 cells than in C33A cells .
The combined effects of the autoregulatory loop established in HIV-rtTA and the T-cell-specific augmentation of the dox response result in rather dramatic induction levels .
In SupT1 cells , an extremely low basal level of virus production is measured , which is estimated to be approximately 0.03 to 0.2 % of the dox-induced state .
Safety issues .
The finding that HIV-rtTA has an extremely low level of virus expression in the absence of dox seems the ideal situation concerning the safety of a vaccine strain .
We performed some additional assays to address safety aspects .
First , we screened for leaky virus replication in the absence of dox in prolonged cultures .
For instance , the SupT1 cultures that were transfected with the four different HIV-rtTA constructs ( Fig .
2 ) were maintained up to day 170 , but no virus production was measured .
Similarly , no replicating virus was observed in primary cell cultures without dox ( Fig .
3 ) .
Second , HIV-rtTA virus spreading in SupT1 cultures could be `` turned off `` effectively by the removal of dox ( see , e.g .
, Fig .
4C for the SWS virus ) , without any sign of virus production .
Third , we analyzed the sensitivity of the HIV-rtTA virus to antiretroviral drugs that are in current clinical use .
Because we did not alter the basic set of viral genes in HIV-rtTA , including the genes encoding protease ( Pro ) and reverse transcriptase ( RT ) , these viruses are expected to remain fully sensitive to well-known drugs that target these essential enzymes .
As shown in Fig .
4D , replication of the dox-dependent SWS virus can be inhibited efficiently either by 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine ( AZT ; a nucle-oside RT inhibitor ) or saquinavir ( SQV ; a Pro inhibitor ) .
These experiments may be viewed as the first safety tests of these putative vaccine strains .
DISCUSSION We have incorporated the Tet regulatory system in the HIV-1 genome such that virus transcription and replication can now be controlled from the outside by addition of a nontoxic inducer molecule such as dox .
Specifically , we constructed replicating HIV-1 variants with inactivating mutations in both arms of the Tat-TAR axis through replacement with the rtTA-tetO elements of the Tet system .
Replication experiments in a T-cell line and primary cells demonstrate that we have successfully designed dox-dependent HIV-1 variants .
Replication of these designer HIV-rtTA viruses is regulatable in a graded and reversible manner .
Although leakiness , that is , residual activity of the rtTA activator in the absence of dox , has been a problem in some applications of the rtTA system , we have not observed any virus replication in the absence of dox .
This may be due , at least in part , to the superior performance of the improved rtTA-S2 protein that was used in these experiments ( 48 ) .
Another possibility is that expression of the rtTA trans-activator in the viral context is fully dependent on the presence of dox .
Indeed , we demonstrated that an autoregulatory loop is established that resembles the natural situation with the TAR-Tat axis .
This mechanism restricts leakiness or dox-independent replication , thereby providing an additional safety feature .
The HIV-rtTA viruses have some unique properties that make them ideal reagents for a variety of biological experi- CONDITIONAL HIV-1 REPLICATION _ 985 ments .
The most obvious application for such a virus is in the field of live-attenuated vaccines , and a similar approach may be used to put control over other retroviral pathogens ( e.g .
, HIV-2 and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ) , pararetrovi-ruses ( e.g .
, hepatitis B virus ) , or DNA viruses ( e.g .
, herpesvirus or adenovirus ) .
The HIV-rtTA viruses will improve the current generation of live-attenuated HIV-1 variants as potential vaccine strains because the conditional replication provides a unique safety feature .
Of the variants constructed in this study , the SYS variant has the most minimal `` genotype `` : TAR~ Tat~ AU3 ANF- « kB Anef .
However , it should be possible to further delete some of the `` accessory `` genes such as vpr and vpu .
The absence of functional Tat seems particularly attractive because this viral protein is known to have several adverse effects on the host cell .
It is anticipated that HIV-rtTA vaccine viruses will be able to induce a protective immune response by dox-induced replication , after which replication can be turned off by the withdrawal of dox , such that the virus will remain nonpathogenic .
In case a booster vaccination is required to mount an optimal immune response , replication can be switched on transiently at later times by dox .
Experiments in mice indicate that the expression of a transgene can be regulated by simply adding or removing dox from the drinking water ( 35 ) .
Our tissue culture experiments also indicate that the level of virus replication can be fine-tuned by varying the dox level .
We demonstrate that the HIV-rtTA viruses are inhibited by antiviral drugs such as the RT inhibitor AZT and the Pro inhibitor SQV .
These viruses will await extensive replication tests to verify their genetic stability , followed by animal tests with homologous SIV constructs to screen for their pathogenic potential and their ability to induce a protective immune response .
Because the TAR RNA and fet gene may have become nonessential parts of the HIV-rtTA genome , these elements may be `` free `` to evolve .
If these transcriptional elements have no other function in the viral replication cycle , one would predict that they would eventually be lost either by deletion or by accumulation of point mutations .
This would further reduce the likelihood of a wild-type-like reversion , thereby making the vaccine strain more safe .
However , the situation may be more complex since additional roles have been proposed for both motifs ( reviewed in reference 6 ) .
This is most obvious for the TAR motif , which is part of the R ( repeat ) region that is critical in strand transfer during reverse transcription .
But TAR has also been reported to contribute to RNA packaging in virion particles .
The Tat protein has also been implicated in nontranscriptional roles , e.g .
, during mRNA translation and the process of reverse transcription ( 13 , 26 , 28 , 44 ) .
Prolonged culture experiments and the analysis of revertant viruses may provide more insight into some of these possibilities .
The HIV-1 TAR-Tat axis was successfully replaced by the tetO-rtTA system , and the latter elements appear to have become essential viral functions .
This may preclude the spontaneous loss of these exogenous elements by simple deletion , thereby enhancing the genetic stability of vaccine strains based on HIV-rtTA .
On the other hand , the current HIV-rtTA viruses do replicate suboptimally .
The advantage of working with HIV is that even if a poorly replicating virus is identified , the error-prone nature of the RT enzyme will allow for the generation and outgrowth of faster-replicating variants by a meth- 986 VERHOEF ET AL .
od termed forced evolution ( 7 , 37 ) .
This evolutionary refinement of the initial designer HIV-rtTA viruses provides a powerful genetic method to identify modified forms of the E. coli-derived rtTA protein and/or the tefO sites that are better suited for their transcription function in a eukaryotic background .
Consistent with this idea , we recently observed improved replication of the HIV-rtTA viruses in long-term infection experiments , apparently without repair of the Tat-TAR axis .
