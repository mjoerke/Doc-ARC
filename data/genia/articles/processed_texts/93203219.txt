A. Transcriptional Regulation of Interleukin 3 ( IL3 ) in Primary Human T Lymphocytes ROLE OF AP-1- AND OCTAMER-BINDING PROTEINS IN CONTROL OF IL3 GENE EXPRESSION®* ( Received for publication , August 17 , 1992 ) Joo-Hung Park } , Kenneth Kaushansky§ , and Lee Levitt } !
From the { Division of Hematology , Department of Medicine , Stanford University Medical Center , Stanford California 94305 and the §Division of Hematology , Department of Medicine , University of Washington , Seattle Washington 98195 We have investigated the molecular and biochemical basis for activation of interleukin 3 ( IL3 ) gene expression in primary human T lymphocytes following CD3 and CD2 receptor stimulation or activation by phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .
Using transfection and reporter gene assays specifically designed for primary T lymphocytes in conjunction with gel retardation assays , Western blot analyses and UV cross-linking studies , we found that c-Jun , c-Fos , and octamer-binding proteins play a major role in transcriptional activation of the IL3 gene via their interaction with two specific regions contained within the IL3 5'-flanking sequence .
Additionally , the region between bases -107 and -59 of the IL3 promoter containing putative AP-2 and Spl binding motifs appears necessary for basal level expression of the IL3 gene .
The data also indicate that CD2 receptor activation and phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation augment T cell IL3 gene expression through the same cis- and trans-activating signals .
These results should contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of IL3 gene expression in human T lymphocytes .
Development and proliferation of hematopoietic cells is primarily regulated by the effects of a complex series of growth factors ( 1 , 2 ) .
One such hematopoietic growth factor is interleukin 3 ( IL3 ' or multi-colony-stimuating factor ) .
IL3 is of particular interest because it is a multilineage growth factor which supports the in vitro proliferation and differentiation of a broad range of hematopoietic progenitor cells giving rise to monocytes , granulocytes , megakaryocytes , erythrocytes , eosinophils , and mast cells ( 1 , 2 ) .
IL3 is also capable of stimulating progenitor cell renewal ( 1 ) .
It is produced primarily in activated T cells ( 3 , 4 ) .
Antigen triggering of the T cell receptor results in the formation of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol , activation of protein kinase C as well as one * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grants RO1 HL 35774 , CA 31615 , and 5 T32 HL 07093 .

or more protein tyrosine kinases , ultimately resulting in cytokine production and T cell proliferation ( 5-10 ) .
Although these events appear to be mimicked by antibodies to the T cell CD3 or CD2 receptor and by phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) ( 11 ) , the molecular and biochemical events mediating cytokine gene expression remain largely unknown .
The activation of the IL3 gene is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms ( 12-15 ) .
Previous studies of the transcriptional regulation of the IL3 gene have been performed in established leukemic T cell lines like Jurkat or MLA 144 using nonphysiologic stimulants such as PMA or PHA ( 13 , 14 ) .
Substantial differences exist in the biology of T cell activation between leukemic cell lines and primary peripheral blood T cells ( 4 , 16-20 ) .
In addition , no direct evidence for the transcription factors mediating the promoter activity of the IL3 gene has been provided .
In this study , we have analyzed cis-acting regulatory sequences and trans-acting factors operational in the activation of the IL3 gene in primary human T lymphocytes .
T cells were stimulated with PMA plus PHA or with monoclonal antibodies to CD3 and CD2 .
Functional transfection assays were used in combination with gel shift and UV cross-linking assays .
Our results indicate in part that the interaction of c-Jun , c-Fos , and octamer-binding proteins with two specific sequences within the IL3 5 ' -flanking region play an important role in transcriptional activation of the IL3 gene .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of Peripheral Blood T Lymphocytes-Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation .
Monocytes were removed by adherence to plastic flasks , and B lymphocytes were depleted by nylon wool columns .
The resultant mononuclear cells were further purified by discontinuous Percoll density gradient centrifugation as previously described ( 21 ) .
Purity as assessed by flow cytometry was greater than 95 % .
T cells purified by this method contain less than 3 % residual monocytes .
Northern Blot Analysis-Twenty micrograms of total cellular RNA were size-fractionated by formaldehyde/agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a Nytran membrane .
The blots were hybridized with cDNA probes for human IL2 ( 22 ) , human IL3 ( 3 ) , and human « -actin ( ATCC ) .
All probes were labeled by random priming .
Blots were washed in 0.5 x SET ( 10 x SET = 1.5 M NaCl , 0.3 M Tris base , 20 mM EDTA , pH 7.5 ) and 0.1 % sodium pyrophosphate at 65 °C for 1 h. Reporter Gene Constructs-Construction of these hybrid genes has been described previously ( 14 ) .
Briefly , a 925-base pair Pstl fragment of human genomic IL3 containing the -flanking region of the gene was subcloned into M13 and sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method .
Using an introduced BamHI site 42 base pairs downstream of the transcription initiation site , fragments of the IL3 5'-flanking region of successively larger size were linked to the bacterial chlor- 6299 6300 amphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene .
All constructions were sequenced for confirmation .
Transfection Assays-Resting primary T cells are refractory to conventional transfection methods .
It was thus necessary to establish alternative assay conditions to analyze cis-acting regulatory sequences involved in IL3 gene activation .
We used a modification of the previously described ( 23 ) prestimulation method .
Purified peripheral blood T lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum , L-glutamine , and antibiotics , supplemented with PHA ( Wellcome Diagnostics , Dartford , England ) at 1 ug/ml and recombinant IL2 ( Cetus , Emoryville CA ) at 100 units/ ml .
After 2 days of culture , the nonadherent cells were harvested , washed with PBS three times , and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum supplemented with IL2 alone at 100 units/ml .
The T cells were incubated for 2 more days , washed with PBS twice , and used for transient transfection assays .
Electroporation of cells was performed by first resuspending lymphocytes at a concentration of 2 x 10 `` cells/0.8 ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal calf serum and IL2 at 100 units/ml at room temperature .
Plasmid DNA ( 30 ug/30 ul ) was added to the cell suspension , incubated at room temperature for 10 min , electroporated ( Bio-Rad , 960 microfar-ads , 350 mV ) , and incubated at room temperature for 10 min .
The electroporated T cells were transferred to RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal calf serum and IL2 ( 100 units/ml ) .
Electroporated cells were incubated without activation for 18 h , then stimulated for an additional 6 h and harvested .
As a control for the relative efficiency of transfection , pRSV- @ -gal plasmid DNA ( 15 ug ) ( 24 ) was co-transfected with reporter gene DNA ( 30 ug ) .
Cell lysates were assayed for CAT and B-galactosidase activity and calculated as described elsewhere ( 25 ) .
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts-Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described ( 26 ) , except that buffer A was supplemented with bovine serum albumin ( 5 mg/m ! )
, spermidine ( 0.5 mM ) , and spermine ( 0.15 mM ) , and chromosomal debris was depleted by centrifugation at X 100,000 g for 1 h. Gel Retardation Assay-Mobility shift assays were performed as described elsewhere ( 14 ) .
Briefly , duplex oligonucleotides derived from varying regions of the IL3 promoter were end-labeled with [ y-P ] ATP using polynucleotide kinase .
Nuclear extract ( 10 ug ) was incubated with 1 ng of labeled oligomer for 20 min at 20°C .
In competition experiments , nuclear extract was preincubated with a 100-fold molar excess of competitor oligonucleotide for 15 min prior to addition of the labeled oligomer .
Reaction products were fractionated by electrophoresis through 4 % polyacrylamide .
For supershift assays , anti-Jun , anti-Fos , or anti-Oct-1 or -2 antibodies were incubated at varying concentrations with the probe-nuclear extract mixtures for a further 30 min prior to gel fractionation .
When immunodepletion assays were performed , antibodies were first incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min before adding the oligonucleotide probe .
DNase I Footprinting Assay-DNase I footprinting assays were performed as previously described ( 14 ) , using 1 ng of an IL3 5'-fragment from -313 to +47 end-labeled at the +47 terminus with [ y-P ] ATP , 10 ng of DNase I , and 20-50 ug of nuclear extract .
UV Cross-linking Studies-UV cross-linking was performed as previously described ( 27 ) .
Nuclear extract-probe mixtures were transferred to a 96-well titer plate and irradiated under a UV lamp ( model UVG-54 , short wave UV-254 nm , Ultra-Violet Products , Inc. ) at a distance of 3 cm from a UV source for 20-60 min .
Protein-DNA adducts were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in the presence of 1 % SDS and 1 % 2-mercaptoethanol , and then electrophoresed in SDS-10 % polyacrylamide gels .
In some experiments , in situ DNA-protein cross-linking was carried out using bromodeoxyuridine-substituted DNA probes as described elsewhere ( 28 ) except that the gel was irradiated with a 312-nm UV light source .
Western Blot Analyses in Combination with the Gel Retardation Assay-DNA-protein complexes were separated from free probe as described in the gel retardation assay .
DNA-protein complex bands corresponding to AP-1 , NF-IL3A-1 , and NF-IL3A-2 were excised from the wet gel .
The gel slices were boiled for.5 min , in the presence of 1 % SDS and 1 % 2-mercaptoethanol , and then electrophoresed in SDS-10 % polyacrylamide gels .
As a control , crude extract alone was run in an adjacent lane and a gel slice was excised from that lane at a position which corresponded to that of the DNA-protein complex .
A further control included an excised gel slice obtained from another adjacent lane which contained only free labeled DNA probe .
Proteins fractionated in SDS polyacrylamide gels were transferred to Westran membranes ( Schleicher & Schuell ) .

Induction of IL3 gene expression in prestimulated primary T cells activated with anti-CD3 antibody plus IL2 , anti-CD2 antibodies , or PHA plus PMA .
Purified resting primary T cells were sequentially prestimulated with PHA ( 1 ug/ml ) plus IL2 ( 100 units/ml ) for 48 h , then washed and maintained in IL2 alone for an additional 48 h. Prestimulated T cells were resuspended in medium alone ( lane 1 ) , or activated with anti-CD3 antibody ( 25 ng/ml ) plus IL2 ( 100 units/ml ) ( lanes 2-5 ) , anti-CD2 antibodies ( lanes 6-9 ) , or PHA ( 3 ug/ml ) plus PMA ( 10 ng/m ! )

After washing three times with PBS , the blots were incubated with '* `` I-labeled protein A ( Amersham Corp. ) in PBS containing 3 % bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were finally washed three times in PBS and developed following exposure to Kodak XAR 5 film .
Mitogens and Antibodies-PMA and PHA were purchased from Sigma and from Wellcome Diagnostics , respectively .
Monoclonal antibody OKT3 ( anti-CD3 ) was purchased from Ortho Diagnostic Systems ( Raritan , NJ ) .
Monoclonal antibodies Tl ; and Tll ; ( anti-CD2 ) ( 29 ) were graciously provided by E. Reinherz ( Boston ) and purified by adsorption of tissue-culture supernatants to a protein G column ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. ) .

Winship Herr ( Cold Spring Harbor , NY ) and Tom Kristie ( Cambridge , MA ) ( 31 , 32 ) .
The antisera raised against Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins each specifically interact with both Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins interchangeably ( 31 , 32 ) .
RESULTS Establishment of Transfection Conditions for Primary T Lymphocytes-Using nuclear run-on analysis , we have previously shown that both human T cell lines as well as primary T cells actively transcribe the IL3 gene within 3 h following CD3 , CD2 , or mitogen plus PMA stimulation ( Ref .
14 , as well as data not shown ) .
Purified primary T cells were first prestimulated with PHA plus IL2 for 48 h , washed , and incubated for an additional 48 h in the presence of IL2 alone prior to electroporation and subsequent activation .
Northern analysis of prestimulated T cells failed to detect either IL2 ( data not shown ) or IL3 message ( Fig .
1 ) .
Further activation of prestimulated T cells with anti-CD2 antibodies or PHA plus PMA induced signals for IL2 within 15 min ( data not shown ) and induced IL3 message within 2-6 h ( Fig .
1 ) .
Although anti-CD3 antibody plus IL2 clearly induced IL3 gene expression in resting T cells , CD3 activation did not induce IL2 or IL3 message in prestimulated T cells .
Although down-modulation of the CD3 receptor could explain this observation , fluorescent cell sorter analysis using anti-CD3 antibody ( OKT3 ) demonstrated comparable levels of expression of CD3 in both resting and prestimulated T cells .
How * R. Tjian , personal communication .
Transcriptional Regulation of IL3 ever , when purified monocytes were added back to prestimulated T cells prior to activation with anti-CD3 antibody plus IL2 , both IL2 and IL3 messages were induced albeit at lower levels of expression than those observed following CD2 or PHA plus PMA activation ( data not shown ) .
These data suggest that either monocytes or monocyte-derived cytokines were depleted via adherence or washing during T cell prestimulation and that these signals are a necessary adjunct to CD3 stimulation of primary T cells ; these results are in accord with recent observations ( 11 ) .
Analyses of Cis-acting DNA Elements Operational in the Activation of the IL3 Gene-IL3 reporter gene analysis was next performed ( Fig .
2 ) .
CAT activity was barely detectable in prestimulated T cells transfected with constructs -107 to -356 and assessed without further activation ( relative CAT activity 7.0-10.4 ) .
Because of the relatively low level of IL3 message expressed following CD3 activation in prestimulated T cells even after monocyte supplementation , reporter analysis was performed primarily with CD2 or PHA plus PMA activation .
When prestimulated T cells were activated with anti-CD2 antibodies or with PHA plus PMA after electropor-ation , CAT activity was increased 5-22-fold ( constructs -356 , -313 , -272 , and -161 ) .
Little inducible promoter activity was observed with constructs -126 and -107 ( only a 1.5-fold increase ) , suggesting the presence of important enhancing regulatory sequences between positions -161 and -126 ( Fig .
2 ) .
A second potentially important enhancing region was identified between positions -272 and -313 .
Deletion of this region , which contains a consensus binding site for transcriptional factor AP-1 ( 33 ) , reduced CAT activity by 50-70 % .
Construct -59 which produced zero level of reporter gene activity in prestimulated cells , was also not inducible following CD2 or PHA plus PMA activation .
In addition to the two enhancing regions , two potentially negative regulatory sites were also identified .
Addition of the region between -161 and -272 , as well as the sequence between -313 and -356 , produced a consistent decrease in reporter activity following either CD2 or PHA plus PMA activation .
The region between -161 and -126 contains closely spaced or overlapping DNA sequences similar to known consensus Fig .

5 deletion analysis of the human IL3 promoter in peripheral blood T lymphocytes .
Prestimulated primary T cells were co-transfected with 30 ug of the IL3 promoter-CAT construct and 15 ug of pRSV-A-gal DNA , then incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum and IL2 { 100 units/ml ) for 18 h. Cells were then activated with either anti-CD2 antibodies or PHA plus PMA or medium alone .
Cells were harvested 6 h after the addition of stimulants and analyzed for CAT and -galactosidase activity .
Transfection efficiencies were standardized with respect to B-galactosidase activity .
CAT activity is expressed relative to the activity obtained with construct -313 ( in CD2-stimulated T cells ) which was assigned an arbitrary value of 100 .
The results represent the mean of four separate experiments for each construct .
The extent of induction is shown in paren-theses .

Site-directed mutagenesis was next used to examine this region in more detail .
Construct -356yrmsa was generated by mutating the residues between -156 and -147 ( ATGAATAATT ) to a random sequence ( CACCCGATCG ) .
This mutation markedly decreased reporter gene activity , whereas mutation of the CREB site ( construct -16lcrge mutated from TTACGTCT to TTACGGAT ) did not affect CAT activity ( Fig .
2 ) .
Analysis of Nuclear Proteins Responsible for IL3 Gene In-duction-Gel retardation assays were next performed to determine whether nuclear proteins bind to functional sequences of the IL3 promoter .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from prestimulated primary T cells and from prestimulated cells following induction with mitogen , anti-CD2 or anti-CD3 antibodies .
When an oligonucleotide probe spanning bases between -307 and -288 ( and containing a consensus AP-1 binding site , -301 TGAGTCA -295 ) was incubated with noninduced nuclear extracts , two retarded bands were produced ( Fig .
34 ) .
Identical results were observed whether extracts were derived from resting or from prestimulated T cells ( data not shown ) .
Activation of T cells with anti-CD2 antibodies , PHA , or PHA plus PMA for 3 h increased binding activity of the upper band ( band C ) 2.5- , 3- , and 4-fold , respectively , whereas no increase was observed with nuclear extracts derived from T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody plus IL2 or with PMA alone ( Fig .
34 ) .
The DNA-protein complex ( band C ) resulted from sequence-specific binding since complex formation was blocked by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe but not by the same molar amount of other oligonucleotide competitors ( transcriptional factor AP2/Sp1 binding elements ( 34 ) and a CK1/CK2 elememt conserved among cytokine promoters ( 2 ) ) nor by salmon sperm DNA ( Fig .
3B ) .
Interestingly , an oligonucleotide spanning the NF-IL3A site ( -161 to -142 ) also displaced the nuclear protein from the AP-1 probe ( Fig .
3B ) .
( The lower band in this retardation assay was constitutively present in primary T cells and was inhibited by nonspecific competitors ; further attention was thus directed primarily to band C. ) CD2-induced AP-1 binding activity appeared relatively transient RELATIVE CAT ACTIVITY uninduced anti-CD2 PHA/PMA ~356 10.4 49.3 ( 4.7 ) 62.3 ( 6.0 ) -356 6.8 17.3 ( 2.5 ) 20.3 ( 3.0 ) NFILIA -313 6.8 100.0 ( 14.7 ) 156.3 ( 22.9 ) -272 7.1 51.4 ( 7.2 ) 46.1 ( 6.5 ) -~161 6.5 62.2 ( 9.6 ) 63.6 ( 9.8 ) +161 6.4 59.3 ( 9.3 ) 61.0 ( 9.5 ) CREB -126 6.7 9.9 ( 1.5 ) 10.3 ( 1.6 ) -107 7.0 10.1 ( 1.4 ) 11.2 ( 1.6 ) -59 0.4 0.4 ( 1.0 ) 0.4 ( 1.0 ) 6302 Transcriptional Regulation of IL3 ( A ) o ( B ) ( C ) s or < « C - - ~ ~ os < 3 B Z 5 § ¥ < 3 § g % & k A ¥ Z x o pt U : < < < Competitor _ 2 7. i 2 > A Stimul P y $ Stimulant 8 § 4 E es DNA 2 < z < 58 & ( 9 & E 1 2 3 - 4 5 - 6 10 20 030 4 5 6 e 3 4 e = witg - og c ~ @ wubuw c_ Hom Fic .

Augmentation of binding activity for an oligonucleotide containing a consensus AP-1 site in T cells activated with anti-CD2 antibodies , PHA , or PHA plus PMA .
All the protein binding elements are underlined .
Results are representative of five separate experiments .
A , 0.2 ng of labeled oligonucleotide probe ( -307 GTGAGCTGAGTCAGGCTTCC -288 ) was incubated with 10 ug of nuclear extracts prepared from prestimulated primary T cells incubated with medium alone ( lane 1 ) , or incubated for 3 h with anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) antibody plus IL2 ( lane 2 ) , anti-CD2 antibodies ( lane 3 ) , PHA ( lane 4 ) , PMA ( lane 5 ) , or PHA plus PMA ( lane 6 ) .
DNA-protein complexes are indicated by C. B , the -307 to -288 probe was incubated with nuclear extract prepared from prestimulated T cells activated with anti-CD2 antibodies in the absence ( lane 1 ) or presence ( lanes 2-6 ) of 100-fold molar excess of competitor DNA .
Lane 1 , no competitor ; lane 2 , AP-1 ( -307 to -288 ) oligonucleotide ; lane 3 , NF-IL3A oligonucleotide ( -161 TCATGGATGAATAATTACGT -142 ) ; lane 4 , AP-2 and Sp1 oligonucleotide ( -98 CCGACGCCTGCCCCACACCACCACCTCCCCCCGCCTTGCC -59 ) ; lane 5 , CK1 and CK2 oligonucleotide ( -126 GAGGTTCCATGTCAGATAAA -107 ) ; lane 6 , salmon sperm DNA .
C , the labeled -307 to -288 probe was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from prestimulated primary T cells incubated with medium alone ( lane 1 ) , or incubated for 16 h with anti-CD3 antibody plus IL2 ( lane 2 ) , anti-CD2 antibodies ( lane 3 ) , or PHA plus PMA ( lane 4 ) .
CD2-induced AP-1 binding activity is selectively diminished after 16 h of stimulation .
since the intensity of the DNA-protein complex diminished markedly when nuclear extracts were prepared from cells stimulated for 16 h rather than 3 h ( compare Fig .
3 , A and C ) .
In contrast , prolonged T cell activation by PHA plus PMA did not affect putative AP-1 binding activity .
The kinetics of IL3 mRNA expression in prestimulated T cells were thus quite similar to the pattern seen following induction of AP-1 binding activity : anti-CD2 mediated augmentation was transient whereas the effects of PHA plus PMA stimulation were sustained ( compare Figs .
1 and 3 , A-C ) .
The transient nature of CD2 stimulation likely reflects rapid diacylglycerol turnover and consequently transient protein kinase C activation , versus the the more sustained protein kinase C activation seen after direct stimulation of protein kinase C by PMA ( 35 ) .
An oligonucleotide ( designated NF-IL3A ) containing DNA elements related to consensus binding sequences for AP-1 and Oct ( -161 to -142 ) was next assessed in gel retardation assays .
This oligomer produced a specific single band ( designated NF-IL3A-1 ) when incubated with nuclear extracts from prestimulated ( noninduced ) T cells ( Fig .
44 ) .
Similar results were obtained whether extracts were derived from resting or from prestimulated T cells ( data not shown ) .
Activation with anti-CD2 antibodies , PHA alone , or PHA plus PMA for 3 h did not increase the intensity of band NF-IL3A-1 but did induce a second band ( NF-IL3A-2 ) migrating a little faster than band NF-IL3A-1 ( Fig .
44 ) .
Although band NF-IL3A-1 was also observed following incubation with anti-CD3 plus IL2 or with PMA alone , no inducible band ( i.e .
NF-IL3A-2 ) was detected following incubation with these e..tracts ( Fig .
4A ) .
Both NF-IL3A-1 and NF-IL3A-2 resulted from sequence-specific binding : a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe ( -161 to -142 ) was able to completely displace both sets of nuclear proteins from the labeled oligomer ( Fig .
4B ) .
Additional competitors like oligonucleotides containing AP-2 and Sp1 binding elements ( Fig .
4B ) , CK1 and CK2 elements or salmon sperm DNA ( data not shown ) had no effect on either protein-DNA complex .
Of interest , an oligonucleotide containing AP-1 binding activity displaced band NF-IL3A-2 but not band NF-IL3A-1 , suggesting that NF-IL3A may interact in part with AP-1-binding proteins .
The inducible NF-IL3A-2 complex was no longer detectable in extracts from T cells stimulated with anti-CD2 antibodies for 16 h , rather than 3 h , whereas NF-IL3A-2 was still easily detectable following incubation with extracts derived from T cells stimu- Transcriptional Regulation of IL3 ( A ) 2 ( B ) < 3 g 3 a= & imul o p if « g P3 Competitor Stimulant 3 é E E Z E DNA 1 2 3 4 5 6 NF-IL3A-1 - CMa © mk NF-IL3A-1 neusas .

Mobility shift analysis with the NF-IL3A oligonucleotide : demonstration of NF-IL3A-1 and NF-IL3A-2 protein-DNA complexes .
A , an oligonucleotide containing the NF-IL3A sequence ( -161 TCATGGATGAATAATTACGT -142 ) was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from T cells incubated with medium alone ( lane 1 ) or incubated for 3 h with anti-CD3 antibody plus IL2 ( lane 2 ) , anti-CD2 antibodies ( lane 3 ) , PHA ( lane 4 ) , PMA ( lane 5 ) , or PHA plus PMA ( lane 6 ) .
The more slowly migrating DNA-protein complex and the more rapidly migrating complex are indicated by NF-IL3A-1 and NF-IL3A-2 , respectively .
All results shown here are representative of three to five separate experiments .
B , competition assays were performed as described in Fig .
3B .
Lane 1 , no competitor ; lane 2 , NF-IL3A oligonucleotide ; lane 3 , AP-1 oligonucleotide ; lane 4 , AP-2 and SP1 oligonucleotide .
C , the NF-IL3A oligomer was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from T cells incubated with medium alone ( lane 1 ) , or incubated for 16 h with anti-CD3 antibody plus IL2 ( lane 2 ) , anti-CD2 antibodies ( lane 3 ) , or PHA plus PMA ( lane 4 ) .
CD2-induced NF-IL3A-2 binding is selectively reduced after 16 h of stimulation .
lated for 16 h with PHA plus PMA ( Fig .
4C ) .
The relatively transient nature of CD2-mediated augmentation of NF-IL3A binding activity is consistent with the AP-1 oligomer binding assays .
DNase I footprinting was next performed with extracts from resting and activated primary T cells ; results were in accord with the mapping data in that protection was observed at both -307 to -288 and at -155 to -147 in the presence of activated T cell nuclear extracts ( Fig .
5 ) .
Protection was not observed in any other region from -313 to +47 .
Construct -59 consistently produced zero level of CAT activity compared to all other uninduced constructs whereas construct -107 was capable of driving the low level of constitutive promoter activity noted in all the other constructs ( Fig .
2 ) .
Mobility shift assays were thus next performed with an oligonucleotide spanning bases -98 to -59 .
Two constitutive noninducible sequence-specific complexes were observed following incubation of the labeled oligomer with nuclear extracts from resting and activated T cells ( data not shown ) .
AP-1- and Octamer-binding Proteins Interact with Functionally Important Regulatory Sequences of the IL3 Pro-moter-Studies were next performed to characterize the DNA-binding proteins which specifically interact with the NF-IL3A ( -161 to -142 ) and the AP-1 ( -307 to -288 ) sites of the IL3 promoter .
Gel retardation assays were performed in the presence of antibodies specific to human c-Jun , c-Fos , Oct-1 , and Oct-2 DNA-binding proteins .
These studies were performed with nuclear extracts derived from either Jurkat cells or primary human T cells .
Nuclear extracts were first prepared from Jurkat cells activated with PHA plus PMA and incubated with the oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 binding site in the presence of various antibodies .
Antisera to either c-Jun or c-Fos were capable of inhibiting the formation of the single specific complex ( band C ) by 90 and 70 % , respectively ( Fig .
6A , lanes 2 and 3 ) as assessed by laser densitometry .
Anti-Jun antibody also resulted in further retardation of the DNA-protein complex ( see S on lanes 2 and b ) ( lanes a and b are from a duplicate experiment and correspond to lanes 1 and 2 , respectively ) .
However , antisera to Oct-1 and Oct-2 as well as control rabbit serum had no discernable effect on the formation of the putative AP-1 binding complex ( Fig .
6A , lanes 4-6 ) .
The identical Jurkat extracts were next incubated with the NF-IL3A oligonucleotide in the presence and absence of antibodies .
In addition to bands NF-IL3A-1 and NF-IL3A-2 ( previously seen in mobility shift assays with primary T cells ) a new band ( NF-IL3A-3 ) was observed following incubation in the absence of antibody ( Fig .
6A , lane 7 ) .
Like NF-IL3A-1 , NF-IL3A-3 activity was not inducible , as it was observed without alteration in intensity in extracts from both resting and stimulated Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
As in primary T cells , NF-IL3A-2 was strongly induced following oligomer incubation with extracts from activated Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .

Two 5 ' regions ( -307 to -288 and -155 to -147 ) are protected from DNase I by primary T cell nuclear ex-tracts .
Nuclear extracts were incubated for 15 min with 1 ng of a 5 fragment from -313 to +47 of the IL3 promoter .
The fragment had been end-labeled at the +47 terminus .
The DNA-protein mixture was subsequently subjected to digestion with 10 ng of DNase I for 1 min and extracted with phenol prior to fractionation in a 7.5 M urea-6 % acrylamide gel .

assays .
NF-IL3A-2 was specifically inhibited by antibody to c-Jun ( 100 % inhibition ) and c-Fos ( 90 % inhibition ) ( Fig .
6A , lanes 8 and 9 ) , whereas NF-IL3A-1 was completely inhibited by antibodies to Oct-1 and Oct-2 with no observed inhibition following incubation with antibodies to c-Jun or c-Fos ( Fig .
6A , lanes 10 and 11 ) .
Formation of band NF-IL3A-3 was inhibited only by antibody to Oct-2 ( Fig .
6A , lane 11 ) .
Antibody to c-Jun also produced a supershifted NF-IL3A-2 band ( see lanes 8 and d ) ( lanes c and d are from a duplicate experiment and correspond to lames 7 and 8 , respectively ) .
Immunodepletion experiments were also performed wherein nuclear extracts were first incubated with antibody for 30 min prior to the addition of labeled AP-1 or NF-IL3A probe ; results were entirely consistent with the supershift assays Transcriptional Regulation of IL3 ( data not shown ) .
The above data indicate that AP-1- and octamer-binding nuclear proteins are responsible for the formation of DNA-protein complexes with functionally important regions of the IL3 promoter in unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat T cells .
Nuclear extracts were next prepared from primary T cells activated either with PHA plus PMA or with anti-CD2 anti-bodies ; these extracts were examined in mobility shift assays in the presence or absence of antibody .
Identical results were observed after either CD2 or PHA plus PMA activation .
The inducible DNA-protein complex formed after incubation with the AP-1-containing oligomer was specifically displaced by antibody to c-Jun ( 80 % inhibition ) and antibody to c-Fos ( 90 % inhibition ) ( Fig .
6B , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
A supershifted band was again produced with c-Jun antibody ( Fig .
6B , lane 2 , S ) .
Antibodies to Oct-1 and Oct-2 had no effect on the AP-1 protein-DNA complex ( Fig .
6B , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Nuclear extracts from activated primary T cells were next incubated with the NF-IL3A oligonucleotide .
Antibodies to c-Jun and c-Fos inhibited formation of the inducible band NF-IL3A-2 by 90 and 80 % , respectively ; antibodies to Oct-1 or Oct-2 as well as rabbit serum had no effect on NF-IL3A-2 ( Fig .
6B , lanes 7-12 ) .
The constitutive band NF-IL3A-1 was almost completely displaced by antibodies to Oct-1 and Oct-2 ( Fig .
6B , lanes 10 and 11 ) , but not by antibodies to c-Jun or c-Fos or rabbit serum .
The above data indicate that AP-1- and octamer-binding nuclear proteins from primary T cells specifically interact with functionally important sequences from the IL3 promoter .
UV cross-linking studies were next performed to more fully characterize the proteins binding to specific sequences within the IL3 promoter .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from CD2-activated primary T cells and incubated with either the oligomer containing the AP-1 motif or the NF-IL3A oligonucleotide prior to irradiation and gel electrophoresis .
A single protein-DNA adduct was observed , after incubation with the probe containing the AP-1 motif , which migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa ( Fig .
7A , lane 1 ) ; the size of this adduct is consistent with that of human c-Jun ( 39 kDa ) ( 34 ) .
The AP-1 adduct was almost completely displaced by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe ( Fig .
7A , lane 2 ) .
When the NF-IL3A probe was used for UV cross-linking , a broad band was observed ranging between 39 and 50 kDa ( Fig .
7B , lane 1 ) ; short exposure of the autoradiogram resolved this broad band into three separate adducts ranging from 39 to 50 kDa ( data not shown ) .
An additional band was also observed which migrated with a molecular mass of about 95 kDa ( Fig .
7B , lane 1 ) which is consistent with the reported molecular mass of Oct-1 ( 90-100 kDa ) ( 31 ) .
Prior incubation of extract with anti-Oct antibody before cross-linking specifically abrogated the 95-kDa adduct ( data not shown ) .
Binding of the NF-IL3A adducts was inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe ( Fig .
7B , lane 2 ) .
Western blot analyses were next combined with gel retardation assays to provide further evidence for the identity of proteins binding to the AP-1 and NF-IL3A sites .
Varying protein-DNA complexes were excised from the wet retardation gel and subjected to Western blot analysis as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
A protein band migrating at a molecular mass of 39 kDa ( Fig .
8A , lane 1 ) was observed with anti-c-Jun antibody for nuclear extracts loaded directly onto the SDS-polyacrylamide gel ( positive control ) .
An identical band was detected by anti-c-Jun antibody following excision of either the AP-1 complex ( lane 2 ) or the NF-IL3A-2 complex ( lane 3 ) .

DISCUSSION We and others have shown that IL3 gene expression is regulated at least in part by transcriptional activation ( 13-15 ) .
The relevant transcription factors mediating IL3 gene activity are largely unknown .
Previous investigations of the mechanisms underlying IL3 transcriptional regulation have been restricted to neoplastic cell lines such as Jurkat ( 14 ) and MLA 144 ( 13 , 14 ) and have used nonphysiologic means of activation such as concanavalin A or PMA as an experimental model to simulate events occurring during normal T cell activation .
The sequelae of T cell activation following either antigen receptor stimulation or stimulation with lectins and phorbol esters differ in many respects including the kinetics of protein kinase C activation ( 36 ) and activation of micro-tubule-associated protein-2 ( MAP-2 ) kinase ( 37-39 ) .
T cell lines and primary T cells also behave differently following activation ( 4 , 16 , 20 ) .
In this report , we have assessed transcriptional regulation of the IL3 gene in primary human T lymphocytes using antibodies against the T cell specific receptors CD3 and CD2 , as well as PHA plus PMA , to activate the T cell .
We have also used mobility shift assays , Western blot analysis and UV cross-linking studies to specifically identify the transcription factors mediating the promoter activity of the IL3 gene .
Our transfection studies with a nested series of IL3 promoter deletion mutants indicate that two 5 `` regions , -313 to -272 and -161 to -126 , are especially important for transcriptional stimulation following primary T cell activation via the CD2 receptor or with PHA plus PMA .
The site between -313 and -272 appears to be targeted by inducible AP-1 activity through the consensus AP-1 binding element ( -301 TGAGTCA -295 ) .
The data also indicate that NF-IL3A is targeted by at least two transcription factors , an inducible AP-1 activity and a constitutively expressed octamer-binding protein ( probably Oct-1 ) .
The NF-IL3A site contains at least two transcription factor binding elements : a heptanucleotide sequence ( -154 TGAATAA -148 ) which matches the consensus AP-1 motif ( TGAG ( C ) TCA ) at 5 positions ( 33 ) and an overlapping octanucleotide sequence ( -155 ATGAATAA -148 ) which matches the consensus octamer binding site ( ATGCAAAT ) at 5 positions ( 31 ) .
The antibody supershift assays , retardation and Western blot analyses and UV cross-linking studies indicate that the inducible DNA binding activity observed with probe -307 to -288 and the inducible NF-IL3A-2 complex observed with probe -161 to -142 in primary and Jurkat T cells is likely to be the heterodimeric complex consisting of c-Jun plus c-Fos .
UV cross-linking did not reveal a protein-DNA adduct at 55-70 kDa ( i.e .
consistent with a c-Fos DNA adduct ) , presumably because the c-Fos component of the c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer does not always bind directly to the AP-1 DNA motif ( 40 ) .

Western blot analysis following gel retardation .
Gel retardation assays were first performed with Jurkat T cell nuclear extracts ( following activation with PHA plus PMA ) and either the -307 to -288 AP-1 oligomer or the -161 to -142 NF-IL3A oligomer .
The inducible DNA-protein band derived from the AP-1 oligomer and bands NF-IL3A-1 and NF-IL3A-2 derived from the NF-IL3A oligomer were excised from the wet gel , boiled , and fractionated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel prior to membrane transfer .
Blots were probed either with anti-c-Jun ( A ) or anti-Oct-1 ( B ) antibodies .
A , lane 1 , 90 ug of nuclear extract were directly loaded onto the gel ; lane 2 , gel slice containing the inducible AP-1 complex ; lane 3 , gel slice containing the NF-IL3A-2 complex ; lane 4 , gel slice containing free NF-IL3A probe ; lane 5 , control gel slice from the retardation gel containing extract alone ; the gel slice was excised from a position immediately adjacent to the NF-IL3A-2 protein-DNA complex .
Molecular mass markers are indicated in kDa .
B , lane 1 , gel slice containing the NF-IL3A-1 complex ; lane 2 , gel slice containing the free NF-IL3A probe ; lane 3 , control gel slice containing extract alone and excised adjacent to the NF-IL3A-1 complex .
mary T cells by PMA alone at concentrations as high as 100 ng/ml .
PMA alone is capable of strongly inducing AP-1 binding activity in a number of cell lines including fibroblasts and Jurkat cells ( 33 , 20 ) .
Nuclear extracts prepared from primary T cells stimulated with PMA have recently been reported to minimally augment AP-1 binding activity whereas PMA in combination with additional stimulation greatly increased AP-1 activity ( 16 ) .
Taken together , these data indicate that PMA alone is not sufficient to induce full AP-1 binding activity in primary T cells .
Our data indicate that at least one octamer protein ( most likely Oct-1 ) participates in the transcriptional regulation of IL3 by binding in a noninducible manner to the NF-IL3A DNA site .
One hypothesis which has been raised to explain how Oct-1 may mediate T cell gene transcriptional activation despite its constitutive expression in unstimulated cells postulates the existence of a separate activator which , following cell activation , interacts with Oct-1 to induce transcription .
The functional activity of Oct-1 in Jurkat cells requires the direct interaction of Oct-1 with a mitogen-inducible DNA binding `` Oct-1l-associated protein ( OAP40 ) `` ( 41 ) .
Oct-2 has been shown to increase the functional activity of Oct-1 in Jurkat cells ( 42 ) .
Our studies indicate that at least two sets of transcriptional regulators interact with the NF-IL3A sequence of the IL3 promoter : inducible AP-1 binding elements and constitutively expressed octamer proteins , most likely Oct-1 .
We did not detect any direct interaction between AP-1- and octamer-binding proteins by mobility shift and antibody supershift assays , even though UV cross-linking with the NF-IL3A oligomer demonstrated two different proteins migrating in SDS-polyacrylamide gel with molecular weights consistent with c-Jun and Oct-1 .
The possible interaction of octamer proteins either with AP-1-binding proteins or with as yet unidentified co-activators to induce IL3 transcription in vivo remains speculative but is suggested by the multiple protein-DNA adducts noted with the NF-IL3A oligomer after UV cross-linking .
Small amounts of CAT activity were observed in uninduced constructs from -107 to -356 whereas the -59 construct consistently produced no activity in either prestimulated cells or following activation with CD2 or PHA plus PMA .
It is possible that our prestimulation protocol may have in part been responsible for this `` basal `` level of CAT activity .
However , several pieces of evidence are against this possibility .
First , no IL3 message was detected in either resting or prestimulated T cells even after exposure of the autoradiograms for as long as one week .
Second , the intensity of the constitutively expressed NF-IL3A-1 band was identical in both resting T cells and in prestimulated T cells ( data not shown ) .
Third , mobility shift analysis with the -307 to -288 oligomer ( containing the consensus AP-1 site ) demonstrated the same 6308 level of AP-1 binding activity in both resting T cells and in prestimulated T cells .
Fourth , two specific constitutive protein-DNA complexes were detected following incubation of the -98 to -59 oligomer with nuclear extracts from resting and activated T cells ; two complexes of comparable intensity were also observed following incubation with extracts from prestimulated T cells ( data not shown ) .
The low level of activity observed in our uninduced constructs may reflect a basal level of IL3 transcription in resting T cells .
We as well as others have demonstrated constitutive transcription of the IL3 gene by nuclear run-on analysis in both unstimulated Jurkat cells and primary T cells in conjunction with very unstable IL3 mRNA ( 15 , unpublished observations ) .
The absence of AU-rich sequences in the -untranslated region of our transfection constructs may have also resulted in relatively stable CAT messages .
The sequence between -107 and -59 of the IL8 promoter contains a consensus binding site at -74 to -65 ( TCCCCCC G CC ) for the transcription factor AP-2 ( 43 ) , and one consensus binding site at -70 to -65 ( CCCGCC ) for the transcription factor Sp1 ( 44 ) .
The possible role of these transcription factors in regulation of IL3 gene expression in either the resting state or following cell activation remains to be determined .
Two differences were observed in analysis of IL3 transcription when primary T cells were used in place of leukemic cell lines .
Construct -59 produced no CAT activity in primary T cells whereas it was capable of driving a low level of constitutive IL3 promoter activity in Jurkat cells ( 14 ) .
Control experiments with B-galactosidase plasmid DNA indicated that this difference could not be ascribed to poorer transfection efficiency in primary T cells .
A second difference concerns analysis of possible negative regulatory elements in the IL3 promoter .
A prominent negative regulatory sequence in the IL3 promoter termed NIP ( between -271 and -250 ) has been identified in MLA-144 cells , a gibbon T cell line infected with the gibbon leukemia virus ( 13 ) .
In our transfection assays performed with primary T cells , deletion of this negative element had only a relatively modest effect on reporter gene activity ( comparing constructs -272 and -161 ) in contrast to the strong inhibitory effect observed in MLA-144 cells ( 13 ) .
Mobility shift assays using an oligonucleotide containing the NIP sequence ( -271 to -250 ) did not detect any specific retarded band using nuclear extracts from unstimulated or PHA plus PMA-stimulated primary T cells or Jurkat cells .
Furthermore , UV cross-linking studies with this oligomer did not show any DNA-protein adduct ( data not shown ) , suggesting that NIP activity may be relatively restricted to MLA-144 cells .
