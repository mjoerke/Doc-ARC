binding sites located at -109 to -118 ( Ii and -163 to -172 ( Ii KB-2 ) from the transcription start site .
We report here that the differential function of each of these NF-B/Rel sites in several distinct cell types depends on cell-specific binding of NF- « B/Rel transcription factors .
Ii « B-1 is a positive regulatory element in B-cell lines and in the Ii-expressing T-cell line , H9 , but acts as a negative regulatory element in myelomonocytic and glial cell lines .
In vivo protein-DNA contacts are detectable at Ii « B-1 in cell lines in which this site is functional as either a positive or negative regulator .
Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays determine that members of the NF- « B/Rel family of transcription factors can bind to this site in vitro and that DNA-binding complexes that contain p50 , p52 , p65 , and cRel correlate with positive regulation whereas the presence of p50 correlates with negative regulation .
Ii < B-2 is a site of positive regulation in B-cell lines and a site of negative regulation in H9 T cells , myelomonocytic , and glial cell lines .
In vivo occupancy of this site is observed only in the H9 T-cell line .
Again , in vitro supershift studies indicate that the presence of p50 , p52 , p65 , and cRel correlates with positive function whereas the presence of only p50 and p52 correlates with negative function .
This differential binding of specific NF- « B/Rel subunits is likely to mediate the disparate functions of these two NF- « B/Rel binding sites .
Proper functioning of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) antigens is critical to the immune response .
The presence of the MHC class HM-associated invariant chain ( Ii ) is required for the proper structure and function of MHC class II molecules .
This was recently illustrated by the analysis of Ii-negative mice produced by gene ablation technology .
These mice were deficient in class II function , had altered class II structure , and were deficient in T-cell development ( 49 ) .
The function of Ii is mediated by its binding to MHC class II heterodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum .
This blocks peptide binding to class II during transport until the complexes reach endosomes , where Ii dissociates , thereby releasing the heterodimers in the mature and correct conformation for binding antigenic peptides ( 13 ) .
The MHC class complex can then be recognized by T-cell receptors which initiate specific helper T-cell functions and cytokine produc-tion .
Although the Ii gene and the class II genes are encoded on separate chromosomes and their structures are unrelated , these genes are to a large extent coordinately regulated .
They are expressed on the same cell types , generally B lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells , and they are coordinately in * Corresponding author .

Coregulation is accomplished through common cis-acting DNA sequences in their promoters ( 11 , 17 , 19 , 52 ) .
Specifically , the class II promoters and Ii share three regulatory elements : S ( also termed H , W , or Z ) , X , and Y , which mediate high constitutive expression in B lymphocytes and gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) -inducible expression ( 8 , 22 ) .
However , in several situations the Ii and class II genes are also differentially regulated ( 29 , 34 , 35 ) .
A notable instance is that the lymphocytes of patients with a severe immune deficiency , bare lymphocyte syndrome , lack all MHC class II expression but do express Ii ( 14 ) .
The Ii gene contains within its 5 ' regulatory region DNA motifs that may regulate Ii expression distinct from the other MHC class II genes .
The promoter of the murine Ii gene contains an SP-1-binding site and an NF- « B/Re !
site ( 52 ) .
The NF- « B/Re !
element in the murine Ii promoter mediates constitutive expression in B cells ( 52 ) and mediates the tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) response in fibroblasts ( 40 ) .
In the human Ii gene , two NF- « B/Rel binding sites at positions - 109 to -118 ( Ii kB-1 ) and =-172 to -163 ( Ii « B-2 ) from the transcription start site have been noted , but the functional role of these sites remains to be elucidated ( Fig .
1 ) ( 17 ) . )
' I ( ‘ he ) NF- « B/Re !
family of transcription factors controls the regulation of a variety of cellular and viral genes through NF- « B/Rel DNA-binding site ( s ) in their promoters ( 1 , 2 , 23 ) .
Members of this family that have been identified and their genes cloned include the p50 ( NFKB1 ) , p52 ( NFKB2 , p49 , or Lyt10 ) , and p65 ( RelA ) subunits of NF-kB , the proto-onco-gene product c-Rel ( HIVEN86A ) , the avian oncogene product v-Rel , and the Drosophila morphogen Dorsal ( 1 , 2 , 23 ) .
Vor .
14 , 1994 NF-kB/Re !
family members share a 300-amino-acid sequence homology , termed the Rel domain , in the N-terminal region of the proteins .
The Rel domain is required for dimerization , binding to cognate DNA motifs , nuclear localization , and interaction with IxB .
NF- « B exists in two forms , either constitutively expressed in the nucleus as in B cells ( 46 ) or alternatively located in the cytoplasm in association with an IxB protein .
NF- « B translocates to the nucleus upon activation by a number of inducing agents such as phorbol esters , lipopoly-saccharides , interleukin-1 , TNF- « , calcium ionophores , lectin , antigen , and DNA-damaging agents such as UV light ( 1 ) .
NF- « B expression in the nucleus is regulated by IxB , a family of proteins including IxBae ( MAD-3 ) , IxBB , IxBy , and the p105 and p100 proteins ( the precursors to p50 and p52 , respectively ) .
These molecules sequester NF-kB subunits in the cytoplasm and inhibit binding of NF- « B subunits to their cognate DNA-binding sites ( 9 , 38 ) .
Induction of NF- « B does not require de novo protein synthesis , is quickly responsive to external signals , and is thus ideal for regulation of genes involved in inflammation and the immune response .
This work shows in vivo genomic footprints of the Ii NF- « B/Rel binding sites in constitutively expressing and IFN-y-inducible cell lines .
Functional analyses of these sites revealed that the Ii NF- « B/Re !
sites serve multiple purposes dependent on the cell type .
Ii « < B-1 is a positive regulatory element in B and T lymphocytes and a negative element in myelomonocytic cells and brain glial cell lines .
Ii « kB-2 is a positive element in B cells but a negative element in the Ii-expressing T-cell line H9 and brain glial and myelomonocytic cell lines .
Nuclear extracts from different cell types formed different complexes with these NF-xB/Re !
sites , and these complexes are composed of different NF- « B/Rel transcription factors .
The difference in the composition of the Ii kB-1 and « kB-2 complexes may explain the opposite function served by these NF-kB/Rel sites in vivo .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids .
The Ii promoter-CAT plasmid 7901iCAT has been described previously ( 11 ) , it contains the Ii sequence from positions -790 to +1 cloned immediately upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene .

RESULTS Protein-DNA interactions at the Ii NF- « B/Rel sites in vivo .
In vivo genomic footprinting is a powerful approach that examines the occupancy of DNA regulatory elements by transcription factors in intact cells .
A number of studies have reported that the functional regulatory units in promoters of expressed genes are bound in vivo ( 5 , 16 , 27 , 33 , 36 , 50 ) .
Our previous analyses by genomic footprinting have revealed that the in vivo protein-DNA interactions and function of the Ii regulatory elements X and Y correlate precisely with the expression of the Ii gene in various cell types ( 12 ) .
We have analyzed in vivo protein binding at two Ii NF- « kB/Rel binding sites in B-cell lines , nonexpressing T-cell lines , the li-positive T-cell line H9 , and IFN-y-induced and uninduced glioblastoma cells .
The NF- « xB/Re !
site proximal to the Ii transcription start at sequence -109 to -118 is referred to as Ii kB-1 , and the distal site at sequence -163 to -172 is referred to as Ii xkB-2 ( Fig .
1 ) .
Figure 2 shows the results of the in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting .
Proteins contacted G residues in the Ii kB-1 element in the B-cell line Raji ( Fig .
2 , top panel , lanes 1 and 2 ) , in H9 T cells ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , but not in the Ii-negative Jurkat cells ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Another Ti-positive B-cell line , Namalwa , and another negative T-cell line , HSB , gave identical results to the Raji and Jurkat lines , respectively ( data not shown ) .

binding sites .
Footprint of the Ii kB sites in the region from -98 to -147 ( top panel ) and -141 to -182 ( bottom panel ) of the Ii promoter with DNA from Raji ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , H9 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , Jurkat ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , and IFN-y-treated U-105 MG at 0 , 4 , 24 , and 48 h ( lanes 7 to 11 ) .
A footprint of the region surrounding each NF-kB/Rel homolog and the nucleotide sequence of each NF- B/Rel site are shown .
Lanes Con and DMS are DNA methylated in vitro and in vivo , respectively .
Open circles mark positions of protections , and solid circles mark positions of enhancements .
observations indicate that the in vivo binding to this site segregates with expression in these cell types and implicates the importance of this element in Ii gene regulation .
In addition to the constitutive mode of Ii expression , the occupancy of the Ii site was also examined upon induction by IFN-y in the glioblastoma cell line U-105 MG. Ii in this cell line is inducible to high levels over basal expression by IFN-y .
The Ii element was unbound in uninduced U-105 MG glioblastoma cells ( Fig .
2 , top panel , lane 7 ) .
Interestingly , after IFN-y treatment , a pattern of protections and an enhancement appear over the Ii xkB-1 site in the glioblastoma cells ( lanes 8 to 11 ) .
These bands become most intense by 48 h , whereupon the pattern resembled the pattern observed on Ii in Raji and H9 cells .
Ii kB-2 had no detectable protein contacts in Raji cells , Jurkat cells , or U-105 MG cells with or without IFN-y ( Fig .
2 , bottom panel ) .
In striking contrast , pronounced binding was detected on Ii kB-2 in H9 cells ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Interestingly , recent findings show in vitro binding to a human immunodeficiency virus kB probe in nuclear extracts from H9 cells ( 41 ) .
Ii NF-xB/Re !
elements have positive or negative regulatory activity depending on the cell type .
NF- « kB/Rel binding sites control transcription in a number of other immune response genes , and the genomic footprinting results suggest that the Ii NF-kB/Re !
sites may have a role in the transcription of the Ii gene .
To determine the functional role of Ii kB-1 and Ii kB-2 , the two sites were individually mutated in the context of the - 790 Ii promoter region ( 7901iCAT plasmid ) and the promoter-CAT constructs were designated Mut kB-1 and Mut kB-2 , respectively .
The wild-type and mutant plasmids were transfected into cell lines representing various cell types , cell extracts were prepared , and CAT assays were performed .
The activity of each mutant was normalized to the wild-type ( 790IiCAT ) construct .
Analysis by transfection into Ii-expressing Raji B lymphoblastoid cells was straightforward and showed that mutation of Ii < B-1 resulted in a loss of transcription to 44 % of wild-type activity whereas mutation at Ii kB-2 resulted in a loss of 53 % of wild-type activity ( Fig .
3 ) .
Mutation of both sites resulted in 28 % of wild-type activity ( data not Vor .

Ii xB-1 and Ii xB-2 have positive and negative regulatory functions depending on the cell type .
Transient-transfection and CAT assays were performed with plasmids containing wild-type Ii promoter and Ii promoter with mutant Ii xB sites in Raji , H9 , Jurkat , and U937 cells .
Raji , H9 , and Jurkat cells were transfected with 5 mg of each plasmid DNA , and U937 cells were transfected with 8 g of DNA .
The mean CAT activity obtained for each mutant ( n > 5 ) is normalized to that obtained for the wild-type plasmid ( 790IiCAT ) , which is expressed as 100 % CAT activity .
The mean CAT activity of the wild-type construct in each cell line is as follows : Raji , 130,158 cpm ; H9 , 222,813 cpm ; Jurkat , 26,178 cpm ; and U937 , 3,591 cpm .
shown ) .
When assayed in Namalwa , another B-lymphoblastoid cell line , similar results were obtained to those obtained with the Raji cell line ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , whereas in vivo occupancy of Ii kB-1 in Raji cells was clearly demon-strated , Ti kB-2 occupancy was not observed ( Fig .
2 , bottom panel , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
It is possible that protein binding occurs at this site but escapes detection because of the nature of the assay or the protein-DNA interaction ; this topic is discussed in more detail below ( see the discussion of Fig .
8 and 9 ) .
These results indicate that in addition to the classical MHC class II promoter elements , S , X , and Y ( 12 ) , the Ii NF- « B/Re !
l sites contribute to the high levels of Ii expression in B cells .
Although most T cells do not express the Ii and MHC class II antigens , activated human T cells and the human T-cell line NF- « B/Re !
BINDING SITES IN MHC CLASS II Ii PROMOTER 2929 H9 ( HUT78 ) do express these genes .
Mutation of Ii « kB-1 reduced CAT activity in transfected H9 cells to 61 % of control activity ( Fig .
3 ) .
Similar results were observed when a more conservative Ii kB-1 mutation ( kB-1m3 ; data not shown ) was used .
Unexpectedly , when Ii < B-2 was analyzed , CAT activity was increased threefold over wild-type levels by mutating this site ( Fig .
3 ) .
In vivo occupancy of this site was unique to H9 cells ( Fig .
2 , bottom panel ) .
Thus in the H9 T cells , Ii xB-1 and Ii < B-2 appear to be positive and negative regulatory elements , respectively , and both positive and negative sites are occupied in vivo .
Analysis of the Ii-negative T-cell line Jurkat revealed no function for Ii sites in Ii gene promoter regulation since mutation of either site did not significantly change basal levels of expression ( Fig .
3 ) .
These results agree with the lack of in vivo binding over these sites in Jurkat cells and are expected because NF-KB is cytoplasmic in nonactivated Jurkat cells ( 1 ) .
When these cells are stimulated with phorbol ester , NF- « B activity is detected in the nucleus .
To broadly ascertain the function of the NF- « B/Rel sites , we examined several other cell lines .
In the human promonocytic cell line U937 ( Fig .
3 ) , the murine myelomonocytic line WEHI-3 ( data not shown ) , and the human cervical carcinoma line HeLa ( data not shown ) , the mutation of the Ii « kB-1-binding site resulted in a substantial increase in transcriptional activity and typically increased promoter activity by 8- to 10-fold .
In addition , as in the H9 cells , mutation of Ii kB-2 increased the basal levels of expression in U937 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
In summary , Ii « B-1 contributes to basal activation in B lymphocytes and H9 T cells and to basal repression in epithe-lial and monocytic cell types .
Ii xB-2 functions as an activator in B cells and as a repressor in H9 cells and U937 cell lines ( summarized in Table 1 ) .
The effect of mutation of Ii < kB-1 and on Ii induction by IFN-y in glioblastoma U-105 MG cells was also examined .
The Ii S , X , Y , and ISRE are required for IFN-y induction of the Ii gene in U-105 MG cells ( 4 , 11 ) .
We were therefore interested in whether the Ii NF- « xB/Rel sites play a role in the IFN-y response .
When absolute values were compared , mutation of either Ii kB-1 or Ii < kB-2 produced a threefold increase in relative CAT activity for both basal levels and IFN-y-induced levels ( Fig .
4 ) .
This increase in Ii gene expression indicates that the Ii binding sites have a negative effect on basal transcription in the glioblastoma cell line .
Since there was no significant change in fold induction ( Fig .
4 ) , our data demonstrate that the two NF-kB/Rel sites are not necessary for IFN-y regulation .
This is in contrast to the Ii S , X , and Y elements , TABLE 1 .

Effect of mutation of Ii kB-1 and Ii kB-2 on basal and IFN-y-induced expression in the glioblastoma cell line U-105 MG .
Cells were transfected with 5 pg of wild-type or mutant plasmids and treated with IFN-y or left untreated .
CAT activity was determined at 48 h after treatment .
The means of the relative CAT activities for each sample are shown below the bars ( # = 8 ) .
They have been normalized to the basal activity of the wild-type construct ( 790I1CAT/no IFN-y equals 1.0 ) .
The fold induction for each plasmid is shown above the bar representing the IFN-y-induced values .
The solid and shaded bars represent basal and IFN-y-induced expression , respectively .
The error bars represent standard error of the mean .
which are all required for IFN-y-inducible transcription in U-105 MG ( 11 , 12 ) .
A similar strong derepression of basal transcription was observed when Mut < B-1 was transfected into CRT cells , a human astrocytoma cell line , and into primary untransformed rat astrocyte cultures ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the Ii NF- « kB/Rel sites also have silencing functions in transformed and primary brain glial cells .
One curious observation is that the Ii kB-1 element is a negative regulatory element in IFN-y-treated glioblastoma cells ( Fig .
4 ) and , as shown by in vivo footprinting analysis , becomes bound upon IFN-y induction ( Fig .
2 , top panel , lanes 7 to 11 ) .
This may indicate that the binding of protein ( s ) at this site is involved in repression during induction .
Conceivably this repression occurs after activation because the enhancement and the protections at Ii kB-1 are most intense at 48 h after IFN-y treatment ( lane 11 ) whereas IFN-y-inducible binding at X , Y , and ISRE is maximal by 24 h ( 11 ) .
We propose that the timing of this interaction indicates that after transcription is induced , a protein interaction that leads to down-regulation is completed at the Ii « kB-1 site .
To study this further , we examined the rate of transcription at 0 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h after IFN-y treatment in a run-on transcription experiment .
As seen in Fig .
5 , Ii transcription increases up to 24 h , plateaus at 24 to 48 h , and finally returns to near basal levels by 72 h. The timing of down-regulated de novo Ii mRNA synthesis immediately follows the timing of protein binding in vivo at Ii « B-1 .
Thus changes in in vivo occupancy at this site may be attributed to the binding of repressor protein ( s ) .
To show that the Ii kB-1 mutation did not create a new regulatory site , we tested another mutant plasmid , « B-1m3 , in different cell types .
xB-1m3 is a more conservative mutation in which described NF-kB contact points ( the first three G residues ) were mutated ( see Materials and Methods ) .

Since two independent mutations of Ii kB-1 resulted in similar changes in Ii basal expression , it is unlikely that Mut kB-1 created another regulatory site for an activator or inhibitor protein .
Ii < B-2 silencer acts in a heterologous promoter , but Ii does not .
To analyze the two Ii NF-kB/Re !
sites in the context of a non-Ii promoter , we made CAT reporter constructs with one of either site inserted upstream of the TK promoter .
These reporter plasmids were tested by transfection and CAT assay in 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.57 1.07 Relative CAT Activity 0.5 0.0 TKCAT - « xB-1TKCAT « B-2TKCAT FIG .

kB-1TKCAT produced slightly increased levels of CAT activity compared with the control TKCAT plasmid ( Fig .
6 ) .
However , Ii exhibited a strong negative effect on the TK promoter , resulting in a complete loss of CAT activity .
These experiments suggest that Ii xkB-1 may be a position- or context-dependent silencer and that Ii is a silencer able to function outside the context of the Ii promoter .
In vitro binding at Ii NF-KB elements and identification of NF- < B/Rel protein subunits .
We considered it likely that the positive and negative regulatory effects of the Ii NF- « B/Rel sites in different cell types were due to differential expression or binding of nuclear factors in these cells ( 39 ) .
We examined nuclear extracts from Raji , H9 , and U937 cells by EMSA and discovered differences in the protein complexes bound by Ii NF- « B/Rel probes in these cell types .
Figure 7 shows protein complexes on Ii xB-1 and Ii xB-2 probes in Raji , H9 , and U937 cells ; the relatedness of the complexes is demonstrated by competition with unlabeled Ii xB-1 and « B-2 oligonucleotides .
Raji nuclear extracts formed four complexes with Ii xkB-1 ( Fig .
7A , lanes 1 to 3 ) and three distinct complexes with Ii « B-2 ( Fig .
7B , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
H9 extracts formed six bands with Ii kB-1 ( doublets are resolved upon shorter exposures of the gel ; also see Fig .
8B ) and two bands with Ii « kB-2 ( Fig .
7A and B , respectively , lanes 4 to 6 ) .
U937 extracts formed two complexes with the Ii kB-1 probe and one complex with the Ii xB-2 probe ( Fig .
7A and B , respectively , lanes 7 to 9 ) .
All of these complexes were specific as shown by competition with homologous as well as unrelated oligonucleotide sequences .
It is striking that each set of protein-DNA complexes is different ; although some bands seem to have identical migration , other bands are unique for the corresponding extract .
In summary , each Ii NF-kB/Rel site appears to bind a different pattern of complexes in each cell type .
We tested the ability of the Ii kB-1 site to bind cloned recombinant NF- « B proteins that had been expressed in COS cells or in vitro translation systems .
The Ii xB-1 probe was able to bind p65 and p50 in the EMSA with the same mobility as that of complexes formed on an HIV- « kB probe , whereas extracts containing expression vector alone were not ( data not shown ) .
This indicates that Ti xB-1 is able to interact with these combinations if they present .
We were also interested in which NF- « B/Re !
family members composed the different protein-DNA complexes on activator compared with repressor sites in the various cell lines .
To characterize the factors binding to the Ii sites , we used specific antibodies in EMSA to identify known NF- « B/Re !
family proteins ( see Table 1 for a summary of the data ) .
A comparison of antibody-treated and untreated reactions with Raji nuclear extracts and Ii xB-1 shows that anti-p65 caused a weak supershifted band ( Fig .
8A , lane 3 ) and addition of the peptide to which the antiserum was made abolished this complex ( lane 4 ) .
The anti-p65 used in these experiments can effectively shift a TNF- « -induced complex in HeLa nuclear extracts ( 7 ) , indicating that the weak supershift obtained in these experiments is a reflection of small amounts of p65 as opposed to inadequate recognition of these complexes by the antibody .
In addition , anti-p50 , anti-p52 , and anti-c-Rel all formed specific supershifted complexes ( Fig .
8A , lanes 5 to 8 ) .
This indicates that Ii protein-DNA complexes include all four NF-kB/Rel subunits in Raji cells .
A similar analysis of Ii kB-2 , the distal site , showed that the same four specific antibodies against p65 , p50 , p52 , and c-Rel reacted with complexes in Raji extracts ( Fig .
9A ) .
Anti-p50 eliminated all complexes on this site .
In summary , both sites in Raji cells are NF- « B/Re !

Ii NF- « B/Rel sites bind complexes in nuclear extracts .
Ii kB-1 ( A ) and Ii kB-2 ( B ) radiolabeled probes were incubated with nuclear extracts from Raji ( lanes 1 to 3 ) , H9 ( lanes 4 to 6 ) , and U937 ( lanes 7 to 9 ) cells .
Specific complex formation is shown by the addition of competitor oligonucleotides at 100-fold molar excess : Ii xB-1 ( lanes 2 , 5 , and 8 ) and Ii xB-2 ( lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 ) .
Circles indicate specific complexes .
activators and all four NF- « kB/Rel subunits were detected in complexes on these sites .
It should be noted that binding of NF-kB/Rel factors to Ii < B-1 is significantly more intense than is binding to Ii kB-2 .
Visible complexes with Ii kB-1 were typically evident after 4 h of exposure , whereas complexes with Ii < B-2 appeared to be significantly weaker and required a threefold longer exposure .
This may affect the ability to detect protein-DNA interactions by the genomic footprinting assay ( Fig .
2 ) .

Ti xB-1-specific complexes contain NF- « B/Rel proteins in different cell lines .
Nuclear extracts from Raji ( A ) , H9 ( B ) , and U937 ( C ) cells were incubated with buffer alone ( lane 1 ) ; normal rabbit serum ( lane 2 ) ; specific antibodies against p65 ( lane 3 ) , p65 in the presence of competitive peptide ( lane 4 ) , p50 ( lane 5 ) , p52 ( lane 6 ) , and c-Rel ( lane 7 ) ; or IxBa protein ( last lane ) .
These reactions were incubated for 2 h at 4°C , and then the radiolabeled Ii kB-1 was added .
The complexes formed were analyzed by EMSA on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels .
All antibodies were tested with probe alone to identify nonspecific bands ( data not shown ) .
Solid circles indicate NF- B/Refl-specific complexes , and open circles indicate antibody supershifted complexes .
antibodies ( Fig .
8B ) .
Ii xB-1 complexes in H9 reacted weakly with anti-p65 , forming a faint supershifted band ( lane 3 ) .
Antibody to p50 reacted strongly with the lower set of bands such that the entire complex was displaced ( lane 5 ) .
Anti-p52 also reacted with H9 complexes .
Anti-c-Rel resulted in a faint supershifted band that was not always detectable .
Thus , all antibodies appeared to react with H9-Ii « kB-1 complexes , which is a positive regulatory site .
The composition of the complex is similar to that of the complex formed in Raji cells ; however , the relative amounts of various subunits appear to be different between Raji and H9 cells .
Ii < kB-2-bound H9 complexes were recognized by anti-p50 and anti-pS52 but not by anti-p65 or anti-c-Rel ( Fig .
9B ) .
Anti-p50 eliminated both bands and formed a strong supershifted complex , whereas anti-p52 climinated the upper com-plex .
From these results the lower complex may be a p50-p50 homodimer and the upper band may be a p50-p52 heterodimer on Ii < B-1 in H9 extracts .
In contrast to Raji , in vitro binding was readily detectable for both Ii and kB-2 by using H9 A Raji B H9 nuclear extracts , which correlates well with the in vivo occupancy of both sites in H9 cells .
Complexes in U937 were recognized only by the anti-p50 antibody of the four antisera tested ( Fig .
8C and 9C ) .
On Ii « B-1 the lower complex was eliminated by anti-p50 while the upper complex was weakly reactive ( Fig .
8C ) .
Ii kB-2 bound one complex in U937 cells .
This complex was completely eliminated by anti-p50 and was not affected by any other antibodies tested ( Fig .
9C ) .
This is similar to findings in a previous study , in which the IL2-Ra enhancer NF- « B/Rel site bound p50 in U937 extracts ( 28 ) .
Nuclear extracts from uninduced and IFN-y-induced U-105 MG cells were also tested for Ii kB-binding activity .
Specific DNA-protein complexes formed in the presence of Ii < B-1 and did not change upon IFN-y treatment ( data not shown ) .
The antibodies used in these experiments were unable to shift any of these complexes .

Ii xB-2-specific complexes contain NF- « B/Rel proteins in different cell lines .
Nuclear extracts from Rfiji ( A ) , H9 ( B ) , and U937 ( C ) cells were incubated as in Fig .

Anti-p50 was able to supershift this complex ( data not shown ) .
We also investigated the nature of the DNA-protein complexes by adding purified IxBa « ( MAD-3 ) protein to in vitro binding reactions .
The addition of IxBa only weakly inhibited the formation of some complexes when Raji nuclear extracts were used ; however , other bands remained ( Fig .
8A and 9A , last lane of the respective panels ) .
The weak inhibitory effects of IxBa on complex formation suggests the presence of small amounts of NF- « B in these complexes , and the inability to abolish these complexes suggests the presence of small amounts of p65 and c-Rel in these extracts , since it has been observed that IxBa can associate with and prevent DNA binding of complexes containing p65 and c-Rel ( 6 ) .
Taken together , these experiments show that the Ii NF- « B/ Rel sites bind NF- « B/Rel subunits in nuclear extracts .
A summary of the data is shown in Table 1 .
It appears that in cell lines in which Ii NF- « xB/Re !
sites have a negative regulatory function the complexes formed were recognized only by antisera against p50 and p52 , whereas in cell lines in which Ii NF- « B/Re !
sites have a positive regulatory function the complexes contained detectable amounts of p65 and c-Rel in addition to p50 and p52 .
Some DNA-binding complexes were not affected by antibody and may represent unidentified proteins .
However , we can not exclude the possibility that some proteins , when contained in certain complexes , can not be recognized by these antibodies .
DISCUSSION In this study we show for the first time the in vivo genomic footprint of two NF- « B/Rel sites present in the human Ii promoter and demonstrate that they have contrasting regulatory functions in different cell types .
We also present extensive analysis of the NF- « kB/Rel !
complexes formed on these sites in different cell types .
Ii « B-1 is a positive regulatory element in Ii-expressing B- and T-lymphoid cell lines and a negative element in myelomonocytic cell lines , HeLa cells , glioblastoma cells , and primary brain glial cells .
Ii kB-2 is a positive regulatory element in B-cell lines and a negative element in H9 cells , myelomonocytic cell lines , and glioblastoma cells .
In vivo footprint analysis revealed binding to proteins at NF- « kB/Re !
sites with both positive and negative activity .
In addition , in vitro binding studies revealed that both Ii NF- « B/Rel sites were bound by NF-kB/Rel-containing complexes in nuclear extracts from all expressing cells .
However , different NF- « B/ Rel subunits bound positive sites compared with those that bound negative regulatory sites .
Collectively these results indicate that the function of Ii NF- « kB/Re !
elements appears to correlate with the binding of different known NF- « B/Rel family members in a cell-type-dependent fashion .
NF- « B/Rel sites are important cis-acting elements that regulate the expression of a variety of inducible , tissue-re-stricted , and viral genes ( 1 ) .
The murine Ii NF- « xB/Re !
site has previously been shown to be a B-cell-specific activator as well as a TNF-a @ -responsive element ( 40 , 52 ) .
The murine Ii NF-xkB/Re !
binding site and human Ii kB-1 are nearly identical , having only a one-nucleotide difference .
This study presents observations on the cell-type-specific regulation of the human Ii gene and shows that Ii NF- « kB/Rel elements have positive and negative regulatory functions that are cell type dependent .
Ii « B-2 dramatically repressed a heterologous promoter when inserted upstream of the TK promoter in TKCAT plasmids in U937 , a promonocytic cell line .
Ii kB-1 did not repress the heterologous TK promoter .
A likely explanation for these results is that the mechanism of repression by Ii kB-1 NF- « B/Re !
l BINDING SITES IN MHC CLASS II li PROMOTER 2933 may be dependent on the context of the Ii promoter .
Interestingly , the function of some NF- « B/Rel sites requires the presence of a separate element that acts from a distance .
This mechanism has been described for a Dorsal binding site ( 24 , 25 ) and for an immunoglobulin Ig xB site ( 42 ) .
It is possible that Ii < B-1 functions in this way since it is position dependent ; however , Ii xB-2 clearly does not have these restrictions .
In vivo protein-DNA interactions and gene expression tend to correlate , as demonstrated in studies of the MHC class I and class II , invariant-chain , tyrosine aminotransferase , muscle creatine kinase , mouse metallothionein I , and mouse transthy-retin genes ( 5 , 16 , 27 , 33 , 36 , 50 ) .
This correlation is supported by our observations of in vivo interactions on the Ii kB-1 element in expressing B- and T-lymphocytic cell lines and the glioblastoma cell line and the strong interaction on Ii « kB-2 in H9 cells .
In some cases an observed in vivo protection does not correlate with induced expression of the gene , as noted on the serum response element of c-fos during induced expression of the gene ( 15 ) and the AP-1 site of the collagenase gene ( 30 ) .
In other situations interactions are not observed on known transcriptional elements such as the S element of MHC class II and Ii genes ( 12 , 28 ) .
In vivo binding was also not observed with Ii kB-2 in B cells and the glioblastoma cell line , where the presence of NF- « kB/Rel proteins in these extracts was demonstrated by in vitro EMSA ( Fig .
2 and 9 ; also data not shown ) .
The absence of in vivo interactions on known regulatory sites may be attributed to technical limitations of the assay or to the inherent low affinity of protein-DNA interactions at this site .
The latter is probably the case because in vitro binding of Ii xB-2 is significantly weaker than at « B-1 and requires 3- and 10-fold longer exposures to rival the intensity of Ii kB-1 binding for Raji and U-105 MG nuclear extracts , respectively .
An intriguing observation is the induction of in vivo protections at the negative regulatory element , Ii kB-1 , upon IFN-y treatment of the glioblastoma cells .
The timing of protein binding to Ii xB-1 is such that maximal binding is delayed until 48 h , which coincides with the decrease in transcription detected after this at 48 to 72 h in the run-on experiments .
During IFN-y induction the endogenous promoter becomes available for factor binding and becomes bound at an array of sites including Ii X , Y , and ISRE at 24 h after treatment .
These results suggest that occupancy of these positive and negative sites during IFN-y induction may be sequential , with binding of the positive sites occurring first and binding of the negative site delayed .
Therefore , the occupation of Ii kB-1 may lead to subsequent down-regulation of the Ii gene .
Another instance of a repressor NF- « B/Re !
l site which is bound in vivo is the Ii xB-2 site , which has clear protein-DNA interactions in H9 cells ( Fig .
2 , bottom panel ) .
Thus , NF- « xB/Rel !
binding to a target site can lead to either enhanced or repressed gene expression .
The detection of in vivo interactions on Ii NF- « kB/Re !
sites that have a negative regulatory role suggests that these elements are bound by proteins that mediate repression .
We extensively analyzed complexes formed on Ii NF- « B/Re !
sites in in vitro binding studies with nuclear extracts from different cell types to assess whether a specific pattern of protein-DNA interactions was associated with a positive or a negative regulatory function ( Fig .
7 to 9 ; results are summarized in Table 1 ) .
In cells in which the Ii sites were activators , the sites are bound by p50 , p52 , p65 , and c-Rel .
The binding of p65 and c-Rel was unique to activator kB sites and was not observed on the negative sites .
Importantly , p65 has been shown to be a strong transactivator through other « B sites ( 3 , 45 , 47 ) .
c-Rel has been shown to have an activation domain but functions only weakly through an NF-KB site .
The negative Ii kB sites bound proteins identified as p50 and pS2 , which 2934 BROWN ET AL .
correlates with previously published observations .
In cotrans-fection experiments , p50 overexpression resulted in repression of p65 transactivation ( through a promoter containing two kB sites linked to a truncated c-fos promoter ) ( 45 ) and repression of an interleukin-2 promoter in EL-4 cells ( 26 ) .
In addition , p50 inhibited induction by TPA ( 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ) activation through human immunodeficiency virus kB sites , which was reversed by an IxB , Bcel-3 ( 20 ) .
From previous studies , p50 homodimers have negative regulatory roles on known NF- « B/Rel sites ( 26 ) whereas on other sites they appear to be transactivators ( 21 ) .
This correlates with our results , which show that p50 is present in complexes on repressor sites in H9 and U937 nuclear extracts as well as on activator sites ( Table 1 ) .
Although the role of p52 in transcription is less clear , it has been shown to transactivate in the presence of p65 ( 18 , 39 ) .
On the Ii sites , p52 is involved in complexes with different functions depending on the cell type .
Some complexes were not affected by antibody in these assays , perhaps owing to different protein conformations in complexes with different components .
Another possibility is that an undetected or unknown factor ( s ) is involved in these complexes .
Such a factor ( s ) may determine the cell-type-specific function of the site .
In conclusion , this work demonstrates that the role of Ii « kB-1 and « B-2 regulatory elements is cell dependent and probably due to binding of disparate factors in different cell types .
In vivo footprinting detected binding of both activator and repressor sites .
Activator functions correlated with the presence of binding activity identified as p65 , p50 , p52 , and c-Rel in lymphocytic cell lines .
Repressor functions correlated with the presence of only p50 and p52 binding activity in H9 T cells and U937 promonocytic cells .
These proteins are involved in the context of a complicated promoter , which differentially regulates Ii expression in a variety of cell types .
