11 Epstein-Barr Virus EBNA3C Represses Cp , the Major Promoter for EBNA Expression , but Has No Effect on the Promoter of the Cell Gene CD21 STOYAN A. RADKOV , ** MARK BAIN , **¢ PAUL J.

A survey of promoters has revealed that the wild-type , unfused EBNA3C can specifically repress expression from reporter plasmids containing the Epstein-Barr virus Cp latency-associated promoter .
Repression of Cp activity required amino acids 207 to 368 , which encompasses a region resembling a basic DBD adjacent to a leucine zipper DNA binding motif and a site which binds to the cellular factor CBF1/RBP-Jx .
However , amino acids 207 to 368 are dispensable when the protein is bound to DNA as a fusion with the GAL4 DBD , thus implicating this region in DNA binding .
Mutation of the CBFI/RBP-J binding site in EBNA3C abrogated repression , strongly suggesting that CBFI/RBP-J is necessary for targeting the viral protein to Cp .
Consistent with this result , mutation of the EBNA2 response element ( a -J binding site ) in Cp also prevented significant repression .
In addition , amino acids 346 to 543 , which were previously defined as important for the repressor activity of the GALA4-EBNA3C fusion proteins , also appear to be necessary for the repression of Cp .
Since repression by these fusions was not observed in all cell types , it seems likely that EBNA3C either depends on a corepressor which may interact with amino acids 346 to 543 or is modified in a cell-specific manner in order to repress .
These data are consistent with EBNA3C contributing to the regulation of EBNA expression in latently infected B cells through CBFI/RBP-Jx and another factor , but this need not directly involve EBNAZ .
Finally , although it has been reported that EBNA3C can upregulate CD21 in some B cells , we were unable to demonstrate any effect of EBNA3C on reporter plasmids which contain the CD21 promoter .
In vitro , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) can induce the continuous proliferation of a subset of resting human B cells .
The resulting immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) have a phenotype similar to that of activated B lymphoblasts and express nine latent viral proteins .
Together these proteins are responsible for the activation of resting B cells which then enter the cell division cycle , induction of continuous prolifer-ation , maintenance of the viral genome in its latent form , and perhaps prevention of terminal differentiation ( recently reviewed in reference 18 ) .
In addition , EBV is the causative agent in the benign lymphoproliferation known as infectious mononucleosis and is associated with at least four types of human tumors : Burkitt 's lymphoma , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , Hodgkin 's disease , and lymphoma in immunocompromised individuals ( reviewed in references 32 and 44 ) .
The viral genes expressed in LCL s include six genes encoding antigenic proteins localized in the nucleus : EBNA1I , -2 , -3A , -3B , -3C , and -LP ( the last four are also known as EBNA3 , -4 , -6 , and -5 , respectively ) .
Additionally , there are three latent membrane proteins : LMP1 , LMP2A , and LMP2B ( also known as LMP , TP1 , and TP2 , respectively ) ( 18 ) .
Three of the nuclear antigens , EBNA3A , -3B , and -3C , are considered to comprise * Corresponding author .

8552 a family which may have arisen by gene duplication since they share limited but significant amino acid homology , have the same gene structure ( a short 5 ' exon and a long 3 ' exon ) , and are arranged tandemly in the EBV genome ( 1 , 14 , 28 , 33 , 38 ) .
Genetic studies using recombinant EBV have shown that EBNA3A and EBNA3C are essential for the immortalization of B cells whereas EBNA3B is dispensable ( 45 , 46 ) .
Experiments in which EBNA3C was stably expressed after transfection into EBV-negative lymphoma cells produced clones expressing high levels of the CD21 antigen ( 50 ) .
In similar experiments , EBNA3C was shown to increase the expression of the LMP1 gene in EBV-positive ( but EBNA33C-negative ) Raji cells arrested early in the G , phase of the cell division cycle ( 2 , 3 ) .
EBNA3C in LCL lysates binds to DNA-cellulose in a nonspecific manner ( 17 ) , and experiments using recombinant protein produced in the baculovirus expression system suggest that it may bind to DNA in association with a cellular or viral protein partner ( 37 ) .
However , binding to a specific nucleotide sequence has not been reported .
EBNA3C is a large polypeptide of 992 amino acids ( aa ) with a predicted molecular mass of ~110 kDa ; in sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -polyacrylamide gels , it appears even larger , migrating with an apparent molecular mass of about 160 kDa .
Analysis of its predicted sequence has revealed features common to many viral and cellular transcription factors .
These features include a region which resembles a basic DNA binding domain ( DBD ) adjacent to a potential leucine zipper motif ( b-ZIP ) and regions rich in acidic , proline , and glutamine residues which are good candidates for domains involved in the voL .
71 , 1997 modulation of transcription .
In transient-transfection assays , EBNA3C can modulate the EBNAZ-mediated activation of the LMP1 and LMP2ZA promoters ( 20 , 24 , 34 ) .
EBNAZ activation of these target genes is complex , involving interactions with various cellular transcription factors .
These factors include CBF1 ( also known as RBP-Jk ) , PU1 family members , and proteins including a POU domain ( 11 , 12 , 15 , 21 , 22 , 26 , 41 , 42 , 48 , 54 , 55 ) .
The best characterized of these interactions involves the binding of EBNAZ to CBF1/RBP-Jk .
Binding of CBFI/RBP-Jx to the DNA sequence 5-GTGGGAA-3 ' in the EBV latency-associated promoter , Cp , targets EBNAZ to DNA , which directs a strong activation domain in EBNAZ to the promoter and also interferes with the interaction between a corepressor that can also bind to CBFI/RBP-Jx ; the net result is strong activation of transcription ( 47 , 54 , 55 ) .
The N-terminal 250 aa of EBNA3C also contain a binding site for CBF1/RBP-Jx , which is located around aa 209 to 212 ( 35 , 53 ) ( Fig .
1B ) .
The physical interaction between EBNA3C and CBFI/RBP-Jx appears to inhibit the binding of the latter to DNA , both in vitro and in vivo ( 34 , 49 , 53 ) .
This protein-protein interaction , which prevents the association of the EBNAZ-CBFI/RBP-Jxk complex with DNA , is thought to be responsible for the EBNA3C-mediated repression of EBNAZ activation shown on various natural and synthetic promoters which include CBF1/RBP-Jx binding sites .
CBFI/RBP-Jx belongs to a family of transcriptional regulators which includes the Suppressor of Hairless [ Su ( H ) ] in Drosophila melanogaster .
In both Drosophila and mammalian cells , these proteins can be regulated by signalling from the Notch family of membrane receptors .
A truncated form of murine Notch , consisting only of the intracellular domain ( Notch IC ) , has been shown to be localized to the nucleus and function as an activated receptor .
EBNAZ is thought to function in a similar manner to the human Notch IC , and since in Drosoph-ila , the product of the Hairless gene regulates the function of Su ( H ) by inhibiting its binding to DNA , it has been suggested that EBNA3C mimics the mammalian equivalent of Hairless ( 13 , 35 , 53 ) .
Another recent study in which a fragment of EBNA3C was fused to the DBD of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transactivator GAL4 showed that aa 724 to 826 can activate transcription when bound to DNA ( 24 ) .
However , similar studies using GALA fusions with larger EBNA3C fragments , for example , aa 11 to 992 and 580 to 992 , showed that when tethered to DNA , EBNA3C can be a very potent repressor of reporter gene expression ( 4 , 49 ) .
In the context of larger fragments and the near-full-length protein , the activation domain is apparently masked .
Deletion mapping revealed two domains which contribute to the repression ; neither region of the protein has been reported as necessary for the physical interaction with CBF1/ RBP-Jx ( 4 , 53 ) .
The identification of these domains suggests that EBNA3C also represses transcription by an additional , CBF1/RBP-Jk-independent mechanism which may involve association with another cellular protein ( or proteins ) .
We recently demonstrated that EBNA3C is an immortalizing protein in the same class as human papillomavirus type 16 E7 and adenovirus E1A ( 27 ) .
That is , it can cooperate in cotransfection assays with activated ( Ha- ) as to immortalize and transform primary rodent fibroblasts , and it can also activate transcription through an EZF response element .
Since EBNA3C can bind to the retinoblastoma protein ( pRb ) in vitro , in a manner which is dependent on the integrity of the pocket region of pRb , we have suggested that the EBNA33C-pRb interaction may also occur in vivo and contribute toward both transformation-immortalization and the repressor activity ( 4 , 27 ) .
EBV EBNA3C REPRESSES Cp BUT NOT THE CD21 PROMOTER - 8553 This study assessed the action of EBNA3C on the EBV latency-associated promoter Cp , the promoter for its own RNA in most LCLs .
The effect of EBNA3C on the CD21 promoter was also determined .
The results show that EBNA3C can repress Cp activity whether or not Cp is transactivated by EBNAZ and that this appears to require CBF1/ RBP-Jx to target EBNA3C to DNA and also probably depends on interaction with a cofactor .
Therefore , in the context of latent virus infection , EBNA3C has the capacity to negatively regulate its own expression and that of the other EBNAs .
Surprisingly , however , although the chromosomal CD21 gene is apparently upregulated in some EBNA3C-expressing cells and the CD21 promoter is very efficiently transactivated by EBNAZ , we were unable to detect any effect of EBNA3C on its activity in transient-transfection assays ; EBNA3C did not activate or repress CD21 reporter plasmids .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids .
p-1425C-CAT includes the B95-8 virus C promoter region ( nucleotides 9911 to 11336 ) linked to the fragment of pSVOCAT and cloned into pUC18 .

p-1425CE2RE-CAT includes nucleotides 9911 to 11336 with a five-nucleotide mutation of the EBNAZ response element ( EZRE ) ( RBP-J « /CBF1 binding site ) , Le .
, 5-GTGAATTC-3 ' in place of 5 `` -GTGGGAAA-3 ' , subcloned from pGL-E2RE ( 7 ) .
pUAS-CAT includes five copies of the GALA4-binding DNA sequence ( 5'-CTCCGCTCGGAGGACAGTA-3 `` ) cloned into the vector pBLCAT2 ( 51 ) .
These sequences are located approximately 120 bp upstream of the transcription start site .
p-1235CD21-CAT includes the full-length CD21 promoter ( nucleotides -1235 to +75 ) cloned upstream of the CAT gene in the pSP65CAT vector .

pCMV-EBNA3C includes a cDNA encoding EBNA3C cloned as a Smal/HindIII fragment from pBSK-15 into the pBKCMV vector ( 27 ) .
pJ144-C1 ( referred to hereafter as pSV-EBNA2 ) includes the Bg/II/NofI fragment of the BamHI WYH region ( nucleotides 44664 to 50628 ) of the B95-8 strain of EBV cloned into the pSV2-gpt vector .
The cloned fragment includes the Wp region and the entire EBNAZ gene ( 8 ) .
pSV-B-gal includes the B-galactosidase gene under the control of the simian virus 40 early promoter ( Promega ) .
pBKCMV-EBNA3CA346-543 was generated by transferring the EcoRV fragment from pGal4-EBNA3Caal1-992A346-543 ( 4 ) , which spans the deletion , into pBKCMV-EBNA3C .
The pSGS5-EBNA3C and pSGS-EBNA3CA207-368 constructs are recombi-nants based on the pSGS vector ( Stratagene ) and contain a wild-type EBNA3C cDNA and an EBNA3CAbZIP cDNA with codons 207 to 368 deleted , respec-tively .
The inserted genes are placed 3 ' of a simian virus 40 promoter and a beta-globin intron .
The EBNA3C cDNA was derived by PCR amplification of a B95.8 cDNA from the EBNA3C-pZip-neoSV plasmid ( 28 ) with primers designed to insert flanking Smeal sites .
From this cDNA , the AbZIP cDNA was derived by removal of the Hpal/Spel restriction fragment , followed by blunt-end ligation to repair the gene ; sequencing revealed that the nuclease blunting of the Spel digest caused the removal of an additional 6 nucleotides so that the deletion spanned the coordinates 99061 to 99548 , leading to an in-frame deletion removing codons 207 to 368 .
The Smal restriction fragments containing the EBNA3C cDNA were blunt end ligated into the Bg/lI site of the pSGS vector .
pGALA4-EBNA3Caa11-992A207-368 was constructed by transferring the EcoRV fragment from pSGS5-EBNA3CA207-368 which spans the deletion , into pGALA-EBNA3Caa11-992 .
pSGS-EBNA3C-Jx ( M ) was constructed by recombinant PCR , essentially as described previously ( 53 ) .
Two overlapping primers , 5'-GGCTGCAGC TGCGGCAGTTAACATGATGCT-3 ' and 5'-GCAGCTGCAGCCCAAAATG CGGCACGAACT-3 ' , were used to replace residues Thr-209 ( T ) , Phe-210 ( F ) , Gly-211 ( G ) , and Cys-212 ( C ) with alanine ( A ) residues ( codons in bold ) .
A fragment which contained the mutated region was amplified with primers 5'-GAGAGATTGGTACCAGAAGAGTCATACTCA-3 ' and 5'-TAGATTCT TCGGTACCGCCTCTGC-3 ' which include KprI restriction endonuclease sites ( underlined ) .
The final recombinant PCR product was digested with KprI , and the purified fragment was ligated to pSGS-EBNA3C which had previously been digested with the same restriction endonuclease .
Introduction of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the entire fragment .
Expression of the protein was demonstrated by in vitro transcription and translation and Western blotting of extracts from transiently transfected DG75 cells .
Cell culture .
All B cells were grown in suspension and maintained in RPMI 1640 ( Gibco BRL ) supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , 2 mM L-glutamine ( Gibco BRL ) , and 100 U of penicillin and streptomycin ( Gibco BRL ) per ml .
Adherent cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified 8554 RADKOV ET AL .
Eagle medium supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , 2 mM 1-glutamine , and 100 U of penicillin and streptomycin per ml ( all Gibco BRL ) .
All cells were maintained at 37°C in a 10 % CO ; atmosphere .
Transient-transfection assays .
B cells were split 1:3 with fresh growth medium 12 to 16 h before transfection .
Approximately 10 `` cells were used per transfection .
Cells were pelleted , and growth medium was aspirated and retained as conditioned medium .
The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold unsupplemented RPMI 1640 ( 150 pl for DG75 cells ) , and the suspension was added to a chilled cuvette ( 0.4-cm gap ; Bio-Rad ) which contained the relevant DNA suspended in 50 pl of ice-cold unsupplemented RPMI 1640 .
The cell suspension was left on ice for 10 min and then electroporated with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser set at a capacitance of 960 wF and 250 V. Transfected cells were placed at 37°C for 20 min before being resuspended in 10 ml of conditioned medium .
Cells were harvested and extracts were prepared 40 to 48 h posttransfection .
Adherent cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method ( 10 ) .
Briefly , 2 X 10° to 5 X 10° cells were seeded onto 6-cm-diameter tissue culture dishes the evening before transfection .
Thirty-two microliters of 2 M CaCl , was added to plasmid mixes , and each mix was made up to a final volume of 250 wl with double-distilled water .
This solution was added , drop by drop , to 250 ul of 2 % HBS ( 10 ) and incubated at room temperature for 20 to 30 min until a very fine white precipitate formed .
During this incubation , the medium in each dish was replaced with fresh medium , and the precipitate was then added to the relevant dish .
The precipitate was left on cells overnight and then removed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , and the cells were refed with 5 ml of fresh growth medium .
Cells were harvested and lysates were prepared 24 h later .
In all transfections , the total amount of input DNA was kept constant by including the appropriate empty vector .
Every experiment was performed a minimum of three times with multiple batches of plasmid DNA and 2 pg of pSV-B-gal was included as a control in all transfections .
Transfected B cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 1,100 rpm for 5 min at 4°C ) , washed in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS , pelleted , and transferred to 1.5-ml tubes in 1 ml of PBS .
Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 60 pl of cold 0.25 M Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) and then lysed by four cycles of freeze-thaw ( 5 min in dry ice-ethanol and 5 min in a 37°C water bath followed by a 10-s vortex ) .
Cell debris was removed by centrifugation ( 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5402 for 15 min at 4°C ) , and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and stored at -70°C for a maximum of 4 weeks .
Adherent cells were harvested after the medium was removed and the cells were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS .
They were then scraped into 1 ml of PBS and transferred to 1.5-ml tubes .
Cells were pelleted ( 6,500 rpm in an Eppendorf 5402 for 30 s at 4°C ) and resuspended in 60 pl of cold 0.25 M Tris-HCI ( pH 8.0 ) and processed as described above for B cells .
All extracts were normalized to B-galactosidase activity , as previously described ( 4 ) , before thin-layer chromatography ( TLC ) assays were performed .
Liquid scintillation CAT assays with [ '*CJacetyl coenzyme A and TLC CAT assays with [ **CJchloramphenicol have been described previously ( 4 , 9 , 19 , 43 ) .
When necessary , extracts were diluted to ensure the assay was within the linear range ( approximately 20 to 40 % conversion for the TLC-based assays and 1,000 to 80,000 epm for the liquid scintillation-based assays ) .
Western blotting .
Protein gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously ( 3 ) with E3C.A10 , a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the epitope WAPSV , i.e .
, aa 682 to 686 of the B95-8 EBNA3C protein ( 25 ) , or a rabbit anti-CBFI/RBP-J « serum ( 16 ) .
Inmunofluorescence microscopy .
Forty-cight hours after transfection with pBKCMVA346-543 in 3.5-cm-diameter tissue culture dishes , C33A cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then fixed with acetone-methanol ( 1:1 ) for 5 min at -20°C .
Cells were rehydrated for 10 to 15 min in PBS containing 20 % normal rabbit serum at room temperature .
Monoclonal antibody E3C.A10 ( neat tissue culture supernatant ) was added to the dishes , and they were incubated at 37°C for 60 min .
After the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS , a fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was added and the dishes were again incubated at 37°C for 60 min .
The cells were finally washed three times with ice-cold PBS , Citifluor was applied , and they were examined by fluorescence microscopy .
GST fusion pull-down assays .
Five microliters of cach in vitro-translated protein was incubated in 200 pl of EBC buffer ( 140 mM NaCl , 100 mM NaF , 200 M Na , VO , , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 50 mM Tris-Cl [ pH 8.0 ] ) with 1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml and 5 pl of glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -coated Sepharose beads .
The reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min rotating at 4°C to preclear .
The beads were removed by centrifugation , and the supernatants were incubated with beads coated with 100 to 500 ng of GST -Jx fusion protein or GST-coated beads as a control .
The reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 60 min at 4°C .
The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times in 1 ml of NETN buffer ( 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 20 mM Tris-Cl [ pH 8.0 ] ) , with vigorous vortexing during each wash .
The pellets of beads were boiled in 80 wl of SDS sample buffer to solubilize the proteins which were then resolved on an SDS-7.5 % polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography .
The coupled transcription-translation reactions were carried out with the TNT system ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions and as described previously ( 4 ) .
The GST fusion proteins were produced , purified , and quantified as described previously ( 4 , 27 ) .

( A ) Cp reporter constructs .
p-1425C-CAT includes a 1.425-kbp fragment of the C promoter upstream of the CAT gene .
p-1425C-CAT-E2RE encodes the Cp fragment , containing a mutated CBFI/RBP-Jx site ( 5'-GTGGG AAA-3 ' mutated to 5'-GTGAATTC-3 ' ) , cloned upstream of the CAT gene .
This mutated site no longer binds CBFI/RBP-Jx in band shift assays ( 7 , 21 ) .
The glucocorticoid response element ( GRE ) , the CBF1/RBP-Jx binding site ( Jx ) , and the transcription start site ( P ) are indicated .
The numbers are nucleotides .

RESULTS We and others previously showed that fusions of EBNA3C ( aa 11 to 992 ) to the DBD of GAL4 could repress reporter gene expression from plasmids including GAL4 DNA-binding sites ; repression was absolutely dependent on specific DNA binding .
In order to determine whether wild-type EBNA3C could have a similar effect on any naturally occurring promot-ers , we surveyed various potential targets .
Since it is quite common for regulators of gene expression to inhibit their own transcription , e.g .
, human cytomegalovirus IE2 ( 29 , 30 ) , the effect of EBNA3C on the EBNA promoter Cp was determined .

EBNA3C can repress its own promoter , Cp .
DG75 cells were transfected with 5 g of p-1425C-CAT which includes the C promoter ( Cp ) upstream of the CAT gene .
These and all subsequent transfections also included 2 pg of pSV-B-gal in addition to the indicated amount of pBKCMV-EBNA3C ( pBKCMV-E3C ) ( A ) or pSGS-EBNA3C ( pSGSE3C ) ( B and C ) .
Lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection and , after normalization to B-galactosidase activity , analyzed by TLC .
( C ) A similar series of transfections performed in EBNAZ-positive Raji BL cells .
Expression from p-1425C-CAT ( Cp ) is repressed by EBNA3C .
In an initial series of experiments , the Cp reporter plasmid p-1425C-CAT ( Fig .
1A ) was cotransfected with increasing amounts of the EBNA3C expression vector pBKCMV-EBNA3C or pSGS5-EBNA3C ( Fig .
1B ) into the Burkitt 's lymphoma-derived cell line DG75 .
These cells sustain a reasonably high level of basal activity from Cp in the absence of EBNAZ and are therefore particularly suitable for assaying repression .
However , the promoter can still be activated ~10-fold by EBNAZ in these cells ( unpublished data ) .
Multiple titrations showed that wild-type EBNA3C expression represses CAT activity driven from Cp by up to 10- to 20-fold ( Fig .
2A and B ; see also Fig .
3 , 4 , and 7 ) .
The specificity of the repression to Cp was ensured by including pSV-B-gal ( which is unaffected by EBNA3C ) in all the transfections and calculating the CAT values only after normalizing to the B-galactosidase EBV EBNA3C REPRESSES Cp BUT NOT THE CD21 PROMOTER - 8555 s I o ® o a. s I kel o LL T `` lll I T 1 1 5 10 15 20 Nhl ug EFFECTOR 20 B 4 5 6 7 s 9 10 -l| FIG .

Repression of Cp requires EBNA3C aa 207 to 368 which include a potential b-ZIP motif and a CBF1/RBP-Jx binding site .
The activity of pSGS-EBNA3CA207-368 was compared with that of the wild-type protein .
( A ) DG75 cells were transfected with 5 mg of p-1425C-CAT with the indicated amount of pSGS-EBNA3CA207-368 ( © ) or pSGS5-EBNA3C ( D ) .
The plotted values are the mean and standard deviation values for three experiments analyzed by the nonchromatographic liquid scintillation method after normalization to B-galactosidase activity ( 43 ) .
( B ) The results of Western blot analysis show that the mutant and wild-type proteins are expressed at similar levels .
Lanes 1 to 5 , lysates from cells transfected with 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , and 20 pg of pSGS-EBNA3C , respectively ; lanes 6 to 10 , similar lysates from cells transfected with pSGS5-A207-368 ( labelled EBNA3CAbzip ) .
B 1 EBNA3C -- activity .
The level of input DNA in this and all subsequent experiments was kept constant by the inclusion of control plasmids ( pBKCMV or pSG53 ) .
Raji BL cells , which express all the EBNA proteins except EBNA3C ( 1 ) , were also transfected in similar experiments in order to determine whether repression of Cp occurred in the presence of endogenous EBNAZ encoded by the Raji virus .
The results ( Fig .
2C ) show that in these cells EBNA3C represses Cp as efficiently as in the DG75 EBNAZ-negative background .
The region of EBNA3C which includes a potential b-ZIP motif and a CBFI/RBP-J binding site is necessary for the repression of Cp .
The region of EBNA3C between aa 207 and 368 includes two motifs which could be involved in targeting EBNA3C to Cp DNA .
b-ZIP motifs ( Fig .
1B and introduction ) are frequently associated with specific DNA binding and in addition the residues flanking aa 209 to 212 of EBNA3C bind to the cellular DNA-binding factor CBFI/RBP-Jk ( 53 ) .
A deletion mutant from which aa 207 to 368 were removed ( pSGS-EBNA3CA207-368 [ Fig .
1B ] ) was therefore constructed in order to remove these features from EBNA3C and test the hypothesis that it is necessary for the repression of Cp .
This protein failed to repress Cp-driven reporter activity signifi-cantly , whereas wild-type EBNA3C , expressed from a similar expression vector , repressed expression from Cp by 10- to 15-fold .
Transfections were repeated a minimum of three times , and the CAT activity was assayed by the liquid scintillation method ( 43 ) .

3B ) .
Repression of Cp requires the CBF1/RBP-Jx binding site in EBNA3C and the E2RE in Cp .
Zhao and colleagues identified a short sequence of amino acids surrounding aa 209 to 212 which is both necessary and sufficient for the functional interaction between EBNA3C and CBFI/RBP-Jk ( 53 ) .
This site is located near the potential b-ZIP and was also deleted in A207-368 .
An expression vector was therefore constructed in which aa 209 to 212 were replaced with alanine residues in a manner similar to that described previously ( 53 ) .
The results of cotransfections with p-1425-CpCAT demonstrated a requirement for these amino acids in the repression of Cp ( Fig .
4A ) .
Both mutant and wild-type protein were expressed at similar levels after transfection ( Fig .
4B ) .
Because the site in EBNA3C necessary for binding to CBF1/ RBP-Jx is required for repression of wild-type Cp , the reciprocal experiment with a mutant promoter and wild-type protein was performed .
A Cp promoter in which the E2RE or RBP-Jk binding site was mutated ( so that it no longer binds CBFI/RBP-Jx ) was subcloned from pGL-E2RE ( 7 ) upstream of the CAT gene .
The results of cotransfecting this with pSGS5-EBNA3C are also shown in Fig .
4A .
The data are consistent with a model in which CBF1I/RBP -J bound to its cognate site in Cp targets EBNA3C to the promoter .
That is , the mutation reduced the level of repression by EBNA3C to a maximum of threefold .
This is consistent with the observation that the same J. Viror .

mutation significantly reduced EBNAZ-mediated transactivation of Cp .
Cp and Cp with a mutated E2RE have similar levels of basal activity .
An alternative interpretation of the experiments described in the previous two sections was that , in DG75 cells , Cp activity is mediated by a cellular activation pathway ( for in-stance , Notch IC [ see introduction ] ) acting through CBF1/ RBP-J and that EBNA3C , by interfering with CBF1/RBP-Jx binding to DNA apparently induces repression .
In order to establish whether EZRE does mediate activation through CBF1/RBP-Jx in these cells , the p-1425C-CAT and p-1425C-CAT-EZRE reporters were transfected , in parallel , into DG75 cells .
The results of multiple experiments using various batches of plasmid failed to show a significant difference in the basal activity of these two promoters in DG75 ( Fig .

The failure to repress the mutant promoter described above must therefore be a consequence of EBNA3C not being efficiently targeted to Cp DNA .
Further evidence for a model in which EBNA3C represses transcription by specifically associating with Cp comes indirectly from an experiment in which the deletion of aa 207 to 368 was functionally replaced by a GALA DBD .
Cotransfection of pGALA4-EBNA3Caal1-992A207-368 with pUAS-CAT showed that this fusion polypeptide represses almost as well as a wild-type GALA-EBNA3C fusion ( Fig .
6 ) .
These results confirm that aa 207 to 368 are necessary to direct EBNA3C to DNA and are therefore consistent with CBF1/RBP-Jx playing a central role in targeting EBNA3C to Cp .
Repression of Cp requires the domain located between aa 346 to 543 which is also required for repression by EBNA3C-GAL4 DBD fusions .
When GAL4-EBNA3C was targeted to a variety of promoters which were engineered to include five binding sites for GALA , it repressed reporter gene activity 15-to 40-fold ( see above and reference 4 ) .
Analysis of GAL4 fusions containing smaller fragments of EBNA3C revealed two independent regions which contribute to repressor activity .
The more potent of these domains is highly acidic ( aa 280 to 525 ) , and when linked to the GAL4 DBD , it repressed almost as well as the near-full-length polypeptide ( aa 11 to 992 ) ( 4 ) .

Approximately equal amounts of 5S-labelled EBNA3C ( lanes 1 , 4 , 7 , and 10 ) , EBNA3CA346-543 ( lanes 2 , 5 , 8 , and 11 ) , and EBNA3CA207-368 ( lanes 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 ) were incubated separately with the amounts of GST-CBFI/RBP-Jx indicated .
The amount of labelled protein included in each binding reaction is shown below lanes 4 to 12 .
Deletion of this region significantly reduced the degree of repression but did not abolish it completely .
To analyze further the contribution of this highly acidic region of EBNA3C to the repression of Cp , cotransfections were performed with the plasmid pBKCMV-EBNA3CA346-543 in which this major repression domain had largely been deleted ( Fig .
1B ) .
Whereas in parallel transfections pCMV-driven wild-type EBNA3C repressed Cp activity ~10-fold , the deletion mutant had no significant effect on reporter gene activity driven by Cp ( Fig .
7A ) .
Western blot analysis of extracts made from cells after transfection showed that both proteins were expressed at similar levels ( Fig .
7B for example ) .
The region of EBNA3C which includes aa 346 to 543 appears to be a major requirement for repression of Cp , which is consistent with it including an important repression domain .
The deleted region of the protein also includes the amino acid sequence KKPRKLP which was identified as a potential nuclear localization signal ( 28 ) .
However , these amino acids are not essential to target EBNA3C to the nucleus since immunofluorescence staining of cells 48 h after transfection with pBKCMV-EBNA3CA346-543 showed EBNA3C distributed in nuclei ( Fig .
7C ) .
Previous reports suggest that EBNA3CA346-543 should still bind to CBF1/RBP -J ( 35 , 53 ) , which was confirmed by GST pull-down experiments ( Fig .
7D ) .
Since we found that at high concentrations of GST-RBP-Jx fusion protein there was significant nonspecific bind 8558 RADKOV ET AL .
ing to various in vitro-translated polypeptides ( unpublished data ) , a titration was performed and within the limitations of this assay , it can be seen that A346-543 binds to RBP-J as efficiently as wild-type EBNA3C .
In contrast and as predicted , the A207-368 mutant ( 53 ) , which lacks the characterized CBF1/RBP-Jx binding site , is unable to bind at the same concentrations of fusion protein .
None of the in vitro-translated polypeptides bound to wild-type GST or a GST fusion containing the N terminus of TATA-binding protein ( data not shown and reference 4 ) .
These results imply that repression of Cp is dependent on more than the simple recruitment of EBNA3C by CBFI/RBP-Jk .
We hypothesize that aa 346 to 543 are necessary for the interaction between EBNA3C and anOther cofactor in transcriptional repression .
Repression by EBNA3C tethered to DNA can be cell type specific , which suggests that it might require a corepressor .
It has been suggested that GAL4-EBNA3C represses transcription by recruiting CBFI/RBP-Jk to DNA ( 49 ) .
However , the results presented above and elsewhere ( 4 ) indicate that this is unlikely and that in these fusions , GALA-DBD fulfils the role of CBFI/RBP-Jx in specifically localizing EBNA3C to DNA .
We and others previously showed that repression by GAL4-EBNA3C is not restricted to human B cells but was also seen in human osteosarcoma cells , murine fibroblasts , and human carcinoma cells ( 4 , 49 ) .
However , two cell lines have subsequently been identified in which the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter including five copies of UAS ( pUAS-CAT ) functions but is not repressed by GAL4-EBNA3C .
SAOS-2 is a cell line derived from a human osteosarcoma which supports measurable basal activity from pUAS-CAT .
Cotransfection of increasing amounts of GALA-EBNA3C ( up to 20 ug ) had no detectable effect on CAT activity ( Fig .
8A ) .
Similar cotransfections using the cervical cancer-derived cell line C33A also showed no repression ( Fig .
8B ) .
The level of fusion protein in the transfected cells was judged by Western blotting to be equivalent to that in transfected DG75 cells , and nuclear localization was demonstrated ( data not shown ) .
These data suggest that SAOS-2 and C33A cells might lack a corepressor which interacts with GALA-EBNA3C .
Alternatively , repression by EBNA3C may depend on posttranslational mod-ification , such as phosphorylation , which may differ in these cells .
Lack of repression is not due to the absence of CBF1/ RBP-J , since it is abundantly expressed in both lines ( Fig .
8C ) .
Unfortunately , the basal activity of Cp ( p-1425C-CAT ) in SAOS-2 and C33A cells was too low for repression of this promoter to be measured , so a direct assessment of Cp repression could not be determined in these cells .
EBNA3C has no detectable effect on the CD21 promoter .
It has been reported that both EBNAZ and EBNA3C stimulate increased expression of the CD21 antigen on the surfaces of some Burkitt 's Iymphoma-derived B cells ( 6 , 50 ) .
It has been proposed that the EBNA3C-mediated activation of CD21 may occur as a result of EBNA3C binding to CBF1/RBP-Jk and inhibiting its DNA binding activity ( 34 ) .
Since CBF1/RBP-Jx can act as a transcriptional repressor when bound to DNA ( 13 , 55 ) , displacement of CBF1/RBP-Jk from its cognate site by EBNA3C would result in derepression , that is , activation of promoters bearing CBF1/RBP-Jx binding sites .
An analysis of the CD21 promoter DNA sequence reveals two potential CBFI/RBP-Jk binding sites ( 6 of 7 matches of the core 5'-GTGGGAA-3 ' sequence .
However , it has not yet been reported whether CBFI/RBP-Jk binds to the CD21 promoter .
We examined the effect of EBNAZ and EBNA3C on reporter constructs including up to 1235 bp upstream of the CD21 transcriptional initiation site ( Fig .

longer promoter construction ( p-1235CD21-CAT ) was so low that TLC assays would not reveal repression , but even at this low level of activity , the more-sensitive liquid scintillation assays ( 43 ) would have revealed severalfold repression if it oc-curred .
The basal activity from p-467 was sufficiently high to register up to 10-fold repression in either assay system , but no activity was detected in this study ( Fig .
10B ) .
In these experiments the level of EBNA3C , as judged by Western blotting , was equivalent to that in similar experiments in which Cp was repressed ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION EBNA3C specifically represses Cp .
In this study , we have shown EBNA3C represses expression from reporter plasmids which include the major promoter for EBNA expression , Cp .
This is the first demonstration that EBNA3C can specifically regulate an EBV promoter independently of EBNAZ activation .
Several lines of evidence indicate that this is specific to Cp .
The demonstration in earlier reports that GAL4-EBNA3C repressed the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter , mouse B-myb promoter , and the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat only when GAL4 binding sites were present in the reporter , showed that GALA4-EBNA3C ( 11-992 ) does not repress by nonspecific cytotoxicity , squelching , or posttranslational phenomena ( 4 , 49 ) .
Similarly , in the present study , several CD21 promoter-CAT plasmids , the E2RE-Cp mutant and also the pSV-B-gal control vector were all unaffected by full-length EBNA3C ( Fig .
9 and unpublished data ) .
Expression from other EBV-derived promoters such as BZLF1 ( -221 ) and LMP1 ( -512 ) was not significantly affected when they were cotransfected with EBNA3C expression vectors ( 24 , 34 ; also data not shown ) , and the human B-myb promoter is weakly transactivated by EBNA3C ( 27 ) .
All these data testify to the specificity of EBNA3C-mediated repression to Cp .
Repression requires CBFI/RBP-Jx as a bridge to promoter DNA and probably involves another cofactor .
It is well established that both in vitro and in vivo EBNA3C and CBF1/ RBP-J can interact .
Furthermore , it has been proposed that EBNA3C can abolish EBNAZ-mediated transactivation by inhibiting the binding of the EBNAZ-CBFI/RBP-Jx complex to its cognate binding site on DNA ( 24 , 34 , 49 , 53 ) .
Deletion and mutation analyses of EBNA3C have shown that amino acids between positions 183 to 240 are both essential and sufficient for the binding to CBFI/RBP-Jk and inhibition of EBNAZ transactivation ; substitution of aa 209 to 212 with alanine residues abolishes the interaction ( 53 ) .
Our current data convincingly show that both the CBF1/ RBP-Jk binding site in EBNA3C ( aa 209 to 212 ) and the 8560 RADKOV ET AL .
interaction between CBFI/RBP-Jx and the E2RE in Cp are required but are not sufficient for EBNA3C repression of Cp reporter gene expression .
This is consistent with a physical interaction between the two proteins targeting EBNA3C to the E2RE in Cp .
This model is supported by the data showing that EBNA3C can also repress transcription if it is tethered to various promoters through a GAL4-DBD ( 4 , 49 ) .
However , an alternative interpretation of this repression phenomenon must be considered .
In vitro , EBNA3C can disrupt CBFI/RBP-Jk complexes with DNA , so it is possible that in vivo EBNA3C destabilizes the interaction of CBFI/RBP-Jx with the EZRE in Cp .
In order to cause repression by this mechanism , CBF1/ RBP-J would have to be functioning as an activator of Cp in DG75 cells .
Although mammalian activation pathways like Notch exist and could be active in DG75 cells , for a number of reasons we think this is an unlikely explanation for the repression of Cp seen here .
First , a mutant of EBNA3C ( A346-543 ) , which retains the RBP-Jk binding site at aa 209 to 212 and binds to CBFI/RBP-Jx in vitro as efficiently as the wild-type protein , does not repress Cp .
This suggests that more than just the interaction with RBP-Jk is required .
Second , if CBF1/ RBP-J were activating Cp in DG75 , then the mutant p-1425C-CAT E2RE promoter would have significantly lower activity in DG75 cells than the wild-type promoter .
This is not the case however ; a careful comparison showed that there is very little difference between the basal activities of the two promoters in these cells .
If anything , the mutant is slightly more active .
This is consistent with other reports of comparisons between reporter plasmids including wild-type CBF1/ RBP-J binding sites and their mutant counterparts in various cells , including DG75 ( 7 , 47 ) .
Consequently , while our data suggest that EBNA3C physically interacts with CBF1/RBP-Jx in vivo , they are not entirely consistent with previous models which proposed that EBNA3C repression ( of EBNAZ trans-activation ) is due to EBNA3C inhibiting the binding of CBF1/ RBP-Jk to DNA rather than forming a complex with it .
Such models were based largely on the observation that the introduction of EBNA3C into electromobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) disrupted CBF1/RBP-Jk complexes with DNA .
We think the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between these data and our current model is that EMSAs do not always accurately reflect in vivo interactions .
This is certainly the case for EBNAZ , since although it is widely accepted that CBF1/ RBP-Jx recruits EBNAZ to DNA in vivo , under some conditions EBNAZ disrupts the binding of CBFI/RBP-Jx to DNA in EMSAs ( 49 ) .
Because aa 346 to 543 are essential for the repression of Cp and encompass the region which , when linked to the GAL4 DBD , represses almost as well as wild-type EBNA3C ( 4 ) , we suggest that it makes contact with a cellular protein which mediates repression .
Since such a molecule may be absent or unavailable for binding in C33 and SAOS-2 cells , this corepressor is unlikely to be an essential component of the transcription machinery .
It is also unlikely to be CBFI/RBP-Jx , since this is abundantly expressed in these cells .
We previously showed that EBNA3C can bind to pRb in vitro ( 27 ) and both C33A and SAOS-2 cells lack a functional pRb ( 39 ) , so it is very tempting to speculate that pRb might be such a corepressor .
It may also be significant that GALA4-EBNA3C represses in H1299 and U2O0S cells which , like C33A and SAOS-2 , are derived from a human carcinoma and an osteosarcoma , re-spectively , but both have a normal pRb ( 4 , 23 , 40 ; unpublished data ) .
The Rb protein has been identified as a transcriptional repressor when targeted to DNA ( 5 , 52 ) , but our attempts to rescue EBNA3C-mediated repression in C33A cells by titrat-ing in pCMVpRb have been unsuccessful ( our unpublished J. Viror .
data ) .
It therefore seems unlikely that pRb is involved directly .
However , we need to understand how pRb and its associated cyclin-dependent kinases are regulated ( or deregulated ) in these various tumor-derived cell lines before we can fully assess the significance of these results .
EBNA3C has no direct effect on the CD21 promoter .
When EBNA3C was stably expressed in the EBV-negative lymphoma line BJAB , there was an increase in the level of the CD21 antigen on the cells ' surface ; this led to the speculation that EBNA3C may regulate the CD21 gene ( 50 ) .
We tested this by cotransfecting plasmids containing the CD21 promoter ( 31 ) with EBNA3C expression vectors .
Although the CD21 promoter ( nucleotide -1235 ) and the truncated version ( -467 ) are both responsive to EBNAZ , we were unable to see any effect produced by the expression of EBNA3C under the same experimental conditions in which it represses Cp .
This result was rather unexpected , since the stable-transfection experiments had suggested that the CD21 promoter might be activated by EBNA3C ( 50 ) .
Clearly this is not the case for the CD21 promoter-reporter plasmids used in this study .
The p-1235-CAT plasmid was originally defined as including the region upstream of the CD21 transcriptional initiation site which conferred B-cell-specific activity to the reporter gene .
It was also found to be structurally similar to CD23 , another cellular promoter which is regulated by EBV ( 31 ) .
Our results suggest that EBNA3C does not directly activate CD21 .
However , at this stage we can not exclude the existence of an EBNA3C-responsive element not included in p-1235-CAT ; such an element could be located further upstream than nucleotide -1235 or possibly in a CD21 intron .
Although the original prediction was that EBNA3C might transactivate the CD21 promoter , in the light of the results with Cp , we should consider why EBNA3C does not repress the CD21 reporters in DG75 cells .
There are two potential binding sites for CBF1I/RBP-Jx located in both p-1235CD21-CAT and p-467CD21-CAT , and both of these reporters are efficiently transactivated by EBNAZ .
If EBNAZ were acting through these sites , then EBNA3C might be expected to repress the CD21 reporters in a similar manner to that of Cp .
Since it does not , at least two explanations should be considered .
First , the potential E2REs may not be legitimate CBF1/ RBP-J binding sites and EBNAZ may transactivate this promoter by alternative mechanisms , as is largely the case for LMP1 ( 41 , 42 ) .
A second , more intriguing possibility , is that EBNAZ does in fact act through these sites and that EBNA3C can discriminate between the sites in the CD21 promoter and those in Cp .
It will not be possible to distinguish between these scenarios until much more is known about the regulation of CD21 by EBV .
These experiments are in progress but are beyond the scope of this investigation .
How does EBNA3C repress gene expression and what is likely to be its significance in the life cycle of EBV ?
To sum-marize , we have shown that EBNA3C specifically represses Cp , even when Cp is not activated by EBNAZ and the data are consistent with EBNA3C being targeted to Cp by CBFI/RBP-Jx .
The precise nature of the interaction between EBNAB3C and Cp remains to be determined .
It is still unclear , for in-stance , whether additional proteins are involved , whether EBNA3C makes direct contact with DNA , or whether its function is modulated by posttranslational modification .
The role , if any , of the potential b-ZIP has yet to be established .
Since Cp is the site of initiation for EBNA mRNA synthesis in most LCLs , these data are consistent with EBNA3C negatively regulating its own expression and also the expression of the other EBNA species .
It is likely therefore that EBNAB3C cooperates with the other EBNAs in a complex regulatory voL .

Finally , there may be some specificity to the action of EBNA3C which could be determined by the sequences which flank CBF1I/RBP-Jk binding sites in different promoters .
Consequently , it is possible that EBNA3C also affects the expression of a subset of unidentified cell genes which include CBFI/RBP-Jx binding sites in their regulatory elements , which may contribute to the role of EBNA3C in growth transformation by EBV .
We are currently addressing these issues .
