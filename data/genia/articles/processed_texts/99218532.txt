L. Tuyt , * Wim H. A. Dokter , `` * Kim Birkenkamp , ** Sicco B. Koopmans , * Chantal Lummen , * Wiebe Kruijer , ' and Edo Vellenga** In the present study we investigated the possible involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family members extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2 ) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) in mediating IL-6 gene expression in human monocytes , in particular their role in enhancing NF-KB activity .
Freshly isolated monocytes treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid secreted high levels of IL-6 protein , which coincided with enhanced binding activity of NF-KB as well as with phosphorylation and activation of the ERK1/2 and JNK proteins .
The ERK pathway-specific inhibitor PD98059 inhibited IL-6 secretion from monocytes .
Transient overexpression of inactive mutants of either Raf-1 or JNK1 showed that both pathways were involved in B-dependent IL-6 promoter activity .
By using PD98059 , we demonstrated that the RafL/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway did not affect the DNA binding of NF-KB but , rather , acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF-KB .
Interestingly , it was shown that NF-B-mediated gene transcription , both in the context of the IL-6 promoter as well as on its own , was dependent on both serine kinase activity and interaction with c-Jun protein .
We conclude that okadaic acid-induced IL-6 gene expression is at least partly mediated through the ERK1/2 and JNK pathway-dependent activation of NF-B transcriptional capacity .
Our results suggest that the JNK pathway may regulate NF-B-mediated gene transcription through its phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun .
-The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 162 ; 4893-4902. xpression of IL-6 in monocytes is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level ( 1-8 ) .
In the promoter region of the IL-6 gene five known functional cis-regulatory elements have been described , namely cAMP-responsive element , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , * nuclear factor IL-6 ( NF-IL6 ) , Spl , and NF-KB binding sites ( 8 ) .
The transcription factor NF-KB has been shown to be a critical regulator of IL-6 gene transcription ( 5-7 ) .
Within the 1.2-kb fragment of the -flanking region of the IL-6 gene the functional NF- « B element is located between positions -73 and -63 ( 5-7 ) .
NF- « B complexes consist of members of the rel multigene family , which is comprised of five major proteins : p50 , p65 ( Rel A ) , c-Rel , p52 , and Rel B ( reviewed in Refs .
8 and 9 ) .
The most abundant dimer is the p50/p65 NF- « B heterodimer .
NF-KB is located in the cytoplasm in an inducible form , in which the heterodimer is com-plexed to the inhibitory subunit , I « Ba .

Both p50 and p65 contribute to NE- « B DNA binding , but only the p65 subunit is responsible for transactivation .
Although simultaneous activity of NF-KB and additional transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-IL6/CEBP , is required to maximally induce IL-6 gene transcription , the contribution of the « B regulatory element to the transcriptional activation of the IL-6 gene appears most prominent ( 5-8 , 10 , 11 ) .
Much progress has been made with respect to the identification of signal transduction pathways involved in cytokine gene expression .
Of great importance are the so-called mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) proteins ( reviewed in Refs .
12 and 13 ) .
Activation of the different MAPK signaling pathways ultimately results in the direct or indirect phosphorylation and activation of various transcription factors and alterations in gene expression .
Although the involvement of the MAPK pathways in IL-6 gene regulation in human monocytes is far from elucidated , there are several observations from other cell systems that may indicate a functional role for the individual kinase pathways in activating the transcription factor NF- « B .
For instance , in COS cells p90®°° % , the downstream kinase of Raf-1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway , has been shown to phosphorylate the N-terminal regulatory domain of I « kBa both in vitro and in vivo only after 12-O-tetraphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation , and thus enhance NF-kB DNA-binding ( 14 ) .
In agreement , in the lymphoblastoid cell line CEM , overexpression of either MEK 1 or ERK1 demonstrated constitutive nuclear localization of NF-KB , suggesting the involvement of the classical ERK pathway in NF- « B DNA binding activity ( 15 ) .
The c-Jun NH-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase ( JNK/SAPK ) pathway can be activated by small GTP-binding proteins , including cdc42 and Racl ( 16 ) .
Subsequently , the downstream kinase MEKK1 is activated , which , in turn , activates MKK4 , the upstream kinase of JNK ( 17 , 18 ) .
Among the sub-strates of JNK are c-Jun , activating transcription factor-2 , and 0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 4894 Elk-1 .
Recently , it was shown that overexpression in T cells of an active form of MEKK1 , a constitutive activator of JNK , results in the direct activation of the IxBa kinase , the degradation of IxBa , and the activation of an NF-KB reporter gene ( 19 ) .
Moreover , in HeLa cells MEKK1 was shown to directly activate the IxBa kinase ( IKK ) complex in vitro , which , through the phosphorylation of IxB , results in the activation of NF-KB ( 20 ) .
These observations indicate a link between NF-KB and the JNK signaling cascade .
The question remains , however , whether the above mentioned signaling pathways are also operational in monocytes with respect to « B-mediated IL-6 gene transcription .
In the present study we wanted to further identify the involvement of the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways in mediating « B-dependent IL-6 gene expression in human monocytes .
One tool in studies of the importance of phosphorylation states of signaling molecules is the use of specific pharmacologic inhibitors of protein phosphatases ( PPases ) .
Opposite of the protein kinases , the PPases regulate the phosphorylation state of key proteins by removing the phosphate group from the tyrosine , serine , or threonine residues of activated proteins .
Okadaic acid ( OA ) , a polyether fatty acid , is a potent inhibitor of the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A ( 21 ) .
OA is known to be a potent stimu-lator of IL-1 and TNF-a production in various cell types , including monocytic cell lines ( 22 , 23 ) .
We investigated the effect of OA on the ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways and their involvement in NF- « B-driven IL-6 expression in human monocytes .

The binding reaction was performed at 26°C for 25 min .
Competition experiments were performed by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled self or nonself double-stranded oligonucleotides .
Supershift experiments were performed by incubating the nuclear extracts and labeled oligonucleotide with polyclonal Abs ( 1 ug ) against the p50 , p65 , c-Rel , and p52 subunits of NF- « B ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
The samples were loaded on prerun ( 30 min , 100 V ) 4 % ( 30/1 ) polyacrylamide gels and run for 1 h at 150 V in 0.5 % TBE at room temperature .
Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR films at -80°C with an intensifying screen .

Electroporation , in 0.4-cm electroporation cuvettes , was performed at 240 V and 960 pF with a Gene Pulser electroporator ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , VA ) .
After electroporation the cells were replated in RPMI 1640 containing 2 % FBS .
Six hours after transfection cells were stimulated for 24 h with medium or OA ( 30 ng/ml ) .
The cells were then harvested and lysed by commercially available luciferase lysis buffer .
One hundred microliters of lysis product were added to 100 pl of luciferase assay reagents , and luciferase activity was measured with the Anthos Lucy ] luminometer ( Anthos Labtec Instru-ments , Salzburg , Austria ) .
Western blotting for ERK1 and ERK2 Phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was analyzed by Western blotting .
Briefly , monocytes were cultured for 16 h in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1 % FBS and subsequently stimulated for various periods of time with medium or OA ( 30 ng/ml ) .
After harvesting , total cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the cells in 500 ul of 1 X sample buffer ( containing 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 2 % 2-ME , 60 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 6.8 ) , and bromphenol blue ) and lysing the cells by passing them through a 23G1 needle ( three times ) .
Cell extracts were directly boiled for 5 min and were stored at -20°C .
Before loading , samples were again boiled for 5 min , and cell extracts were resolved by running 0.1 vol on a SDS-12.5 % PAGE gel ( acrylamide/bis-acrylamide , 173/1 ) and transferred to cellulose nitrate membrane ( Schlei-cher & Schuell , Germany ) .

Cells ( 15 X 10° ) were then treated for various periods of time with medium or OA ( 30 ng/m ! )
.
After stimulation , cells were harvested and resuspended in 400 ul of lysis buffer ( 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.4 ) , 2 mM EGTA , 50 mM B-glycerophosphate , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM Na ; VO , , 1 % Triton X-100 , 10 % glycerol , 10 pg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor , 10 pg/ml leupeptin , and 0.4 mM PMSF ) and lysed on ice for 15 min .
After centrifugation at 3000 rpm and normalization for protein content in the superna-tant , lysates were incubated with anti-JNK Ab in a total volume of 500 pl and rotated for 30 min at 4°C .
Twenty-five microliters of a slurry of 50 % protein A-Sepharose beads was then added to the lysate/Ab mixture and left rotating overnight at 4°C .
Subsequently , the Ab/beads/conjugate mixture was washed with lysis buffer ( three times ) , twice with LiCl buffer ( 500 mM LiCl , 100 mM Tris-CI ( pH 7.6 ) , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , and 1 mM DTT ) , and finally with buffer A ( three times ; 20 mM MOPS ( pH 7.2 ) , 2 mM EGTA , 10 mM MgCl , , 1 mM DTT , and 0.1 % Triton X-100 ) .

Results OA induces IL-6 expression in human monocytes at the transcriptional level Freshly isolated human monocytes were stimulated with the serine/threonine-specific PPase inhibitor OA and after 24 h of stimulation IL-6 protein levels were measured in cell-free super-natants .
Treatment of monocytes with OA ( 30 ng/m ! )
resulted in distinct increases in the secretion of IL-6 protein ( 1898 + 1164 vs 4 + 4 pg/tl for unstimulated control ; p < 0.005 ; Fig .
1 ) .
Treatment of the cells with higher concentrations of OA , up to 200 ng/ml , induced even higher levels of IL-6 protein .
These concen-trations , however , appeared toxic after 24 h of stimulation .
Additional experiments were thus performed with 30 ng/ml OA .
OA has been demonstrated to induce the expression of TNF- « from human monocytes ( 23 ) .
To examine whether the effects of OA on IL-6 secretion are mediated directly or indirectly through the release of TNF- « @ , Ab against this cytokine was added to the cell culture .
Fig .
1 illustrates that treatment of monocytes with OA plus anti-TNF-a resulted in a partial down-regulation of IL-6 secretion compared with that after treatment with OA alone ( 1104 + 628 pg/ml for OA plus anti-TNF-a vs 1898 + 1164 pg/ml for OA alone ; p < 0.005 ) , indicating that the secretion of IL-6 protein by OA is only partly an indirect phenomenon mediated by the release of TNF- « .
Addition of an anti-IL-1B Ab had no effect ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether the OA-mediated increase in IL-6 protein secretion was established at the transcriptional level , nuclear run-on studies were performed .
Monocytes were treated with medium or medium plus OA ( 30 ng/m ! )
for 7 h , after which the IL-6 in vitro transcription rate was determined .
Results demonstrated that after normalization for the GAPDH signal , OA enhanced the IL-6 transcription rate 3.2-fold after 7 h of stimulation ( Fig .
2 ) .
The increase in the in vitro IL-6 transcription rate was quantified by phosphorimaging .
The up-regulated IL-6 transcription rate was reflected at the level of mRNA .
Treatment of monocytes with OA ( 30 ng/ml ) for various periods of time ( 0-10 h ) resulted in enhanced IL-6 mRNA levels , as determined by Northern blot analysis ( data not shown ) .
IL-6 mRNA was first observed after 6 h of stimulation with OA .
The slow activation kinetics of OA , as observed in the nuclear run-on and Northern analysis , are in agreement with previous reports describing slow activation of both TNF- « and IL-1 $ gene expression after OA stimulation ( 29 , 30 ) .

Freshly isolated human monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 % FBS for 16 h and subsequently treated with medium ( control ) or OA ( 30 ng/m ! )
for 7 h. Nuclei from 40 X 10° monocytes/group were isolated and incubated with [ a-* `` P ] JUTP as described previously .

Quantification of newly synthesized RNAs was performed by phosphorimaging , after normalization to the GAPDH signal .
B , Graphical representation of the results obtained after quantification .
OA enhances the binding activity of transcription factor NF- « B To delineate the role of the transcription factor NF-kB in OA-mediated IL-6 expression we performed EMSAs using nuclear extracts from OA-stimulated monocytes .
In unstimulated monocytes binding of the NF- « B complex was low ( Fig .
3 , lane 1 ) , whereas stimulation with OA ( 30 ng/ml ) for 4 or 6 h resulted in a distinct increase in NF- « B binding activity ( Fig .
3 , lanes 2 and 4 , respectively ) .
Exposure to OA for shorter periods did not enhance NF- « B binding activity ( data not shown ) .
Supershift experiments performed with Abs specific for the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF- « B family indicated that in monocytes the NF- « B complex , which binds to the « B-specific binding sequence , indeed consisted of the p50 and p65 subunits , both before and after OA exposure ( Fig .
4A , lanes 1-3 and 4-6 , respectively ) .
It is well established that NF-KB consisting of p50 and p65 can be transcriptionally active ( 8 , 9 ) .
Two other members of the NF- « B family , c-Rel and p52 , were not identified in the OA-induced NF- « B complex ( Fig .
5 ) .
OA induces phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 and activation of JNK1 in monocytes The MAPK signaling cascade involving Raf-1 , MEK1 , and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation is probably an important signal transduction pathway leading to cytokine gene expression ( 12 , 13 ) .
To study the effects of OA on activity of this MAPK pathway , we measured the phosphorylation of ERK1 ( p44* `` * ) and ERK2 ( p42 ~* ) .
Monocytes were treated with OA ( 30 ng/ml ) for various periods of time and were subsequently analyzed for phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 by means of immunodetection .

An EMSA for the transcription factor NF-B ( Zanes 1-6 ) , was performed after treatment of monocytes with medium ( Zane 1 ) , OA ( 30 ng/ml , 4 or 6 h ; lanes 2 and 4 ) , PD98059 ( 30-min pretreatment ) plus OA ( 4 or 6 h ; lanes 3 and 5 ) , or H7 ( 30-min pretreatment ) plus OA ( 4 or 6 h ; lane 6 ) .
A band-shift assay was performed as described in Materials and Methods , using P-labeled oligonucleotides specific for NF-xB .
An excess of free probe is shown .
shown in Fig .
6 , OA induced a shift in the mobility of both ERK1 and ERK2 , indicating phosphorylation of the respective proteins .
The observed shift , however , demonstrated slow kinetics .
The ERK1 shift was first seen after 30 min of stimulation with OA ( data not shown ) , and phosphorylation peaked at 90 min of stimulation .
The ERK2 shift was first observed after 60 min of stimulation , and an optimal phosphorylation state was found at 90 min .
In contrast , PMA-mediated ERK phosphorylation peaked as early as 5 min after addition of the stimulus .
In view of the slow activation kinetics of the ERKs after OA treatment , we treated monocytes with OA and anti-TNF- « Ab simultaneously and subsequently analyzed for ERK - phosphorylation .
Anti-TNF- « @ coincubation did not affect the OA-induced ERK shifts ( data not shown ) .
In this respect , delayed onset of OA-induced activity was described previously for OA-mediated ERK activity in Jurkat T cells and B lymphocytes ( 31 , 32 ) .
A relevant explanation for the delayed onset is that OA elicits its effect by disrupting the balance between low , basal protein phosphorylation and basal protein de-phosphorylation in favor of protein phosphorylation .
Signaling modules will be subsequently activated only after a relatively long incubation time .

We determined activation of the JNK pathway by measuring JNK in vitro kinase activity as a result of OA treatment .
After monocytes were treated with OA ( 30 ng/m ! )
for various periods of time , JNK 1 was immunoprecipi-tated , and equal amounts of protein were subsequently assayed for in vitro kinase activity toward its specific substrate ( c-Jun ) in the presence of radiolabeled ATP .
As depicted in Fig .

Supershift experiments with the Abs against the c-Rel and p52 NF-KB family members clearly demonstrate the absence of these subunits in the OA-induced NF- « B DNA binding complex .
p50 and p65 are present in the complex as shown by the considerable decrease in DNA-bound NF-KB .
Due to the low amount of protein , supershifts are not readily detectable .
Inhibition of the ERK pathway by PD98059 down-regulates OA-mediated IL-6 secretion , but not NF- « xB DNA binding activity To summarize , we demonstrated that OA up-regulated IL-6 protein and mRNA levels in monocytes , which coincided with enhanced OA PMA time ( min ) 0° 5° 15 !

Immunoprecipitation of JNK from cell lysates is described in detail in Materials and Methods .

Furthermore , the MAP kinases ERK 1 , ERK2 , and JNK 1 were activated in response to OA treatment .
The question remains , however , whether the OA-induced phosphorylation of ERK1 , ERK2 , and JNK1 is directly involved in the up-regulation of IL-6 gene expression by OA .
To answer this question with regard to the ERK 1/2 pathway we treated monocytes with the Raf-1/MEKI1/ERK pathway-specific pharmacological inhibitor PD98059 .
At a concentration of 10 wM PD98059 the activity of MEK 1 , the kinase upstream from ERK1 and ERK2 , was almost totally inhibited ( 25 ) .
In our experiments PD98059 dramatically down-regulates OA-induced IL-6 secretion ( 100 % for OA-induced IL-6 secretion vs 7.3 + 4.1 % for PD98059- plus OA-mediated IL-6 secretion ; p < 0.005 ; Fig .

PD98059 at this concentration was not toxic for the monocytes , as determined by trypan blue exclusion assays and lactate dehydrogenase levels in culture supernatants ( data not shown ) ( 33 ) .
Band-shift assays using nuclear extracts derived from monocytes pretreated with PD98059 for 30 min before OA stimulation for 6 h demonstrated no considerable change in the binding activity of NF- « B ( or of AP-1 or NF-IL6 ; data not shown ) , as deter 100 € so £ E so 5 40 20 * T o , |_I—\ Alls OA PD & OA 117 & OA FIGURE 8 .

Thus , the ERK pathway did not play a role in DNA binding activity of this transcription factor .
We , subsequently , demonstrated that the observed difference between inhibited IL-6 protein secretion and the lack of effect regarding NF-KB binding activity by PD98059 could not be explained by a change in composition of the NF- « B complex .
The NF- « B complex consisted of p50 and p65 subunits both with and without PD98059 pretreatment ( Fig .
44 , lanes 4-9 ) .
OA enhances IL-6 promoter activity in the TF-1 myeloid cell line IL-6 transcription was investigated in more detail by transiently transfecting the TF-1 cell line with three 5'-end deletion constructs derived from the human IL-6 promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene , plL6luc ( -602 ) , plLéluc ( -122 ) , and pIL6luc ( -60 ) ( Fig .
9A ) .
Results from the transfection experiments demonstrated that , in concordance with the observations in monocytes , OA induced activity of the entire IL-6 promoter in TF-1 cells ( Fig .
9B ) .
After - transfection - with the largest promoter construct plLéluc ( -602 ) , which contains the binding sites for both AP-1 and NF- « B , OA ( 30 ng/ml ) up-regulated IL-6 promoter activity 7.8 + 4.8-fold ( p < 0.05 ) .
When plLéluc ( -112 ) , which merely contains the NF-KB binding site , was introduced into TF-1 cells , OA elicited a 14.3 + 10.0-fold ( p < 0.05 ) induction in IL-6 promoter activity .
This would imply possible negative regulatory cis elements in the promoter region downstream from the NF-KB site , within the region -122 through -602 .
Using a promoter construct lacking the binding sites for any of the transcription factors ( pIL6luc ( -60 ) ) , a minimal residual induction of the promoter activity was observed after OA treatment ( 1.5 + 0.3-fold ) .
These results indicated that OA is a potent inducer of IL-6 gene transcription , and furthermore , that transactivation by the NF-KB complex greatly contributes to OA-induced IL-6 gene transcription .
To confirm that OA can indeed directly enhance the transcriptional activity of NF- « B , TF-1 cells were transfected with the pGAL4-p65 or pGAL4-dbd constructs in combination with the reporter plasmid pGALAtklue ( 34 ) .
The GAL4-transactivator fusion proteins are exclusively nuclear and are regulated independently of IB .
The reporter plasmid pGALAtklue is under the control of multiple GALA binding sites .
This GAL4 one-hybrid technique allows analysis of the « B p65 transactivation mechanism .
The results demonstrated that OA enhanced p65-mediated transactivation by 2.2 + 1.2-fold ( p < 0.05 ) , indicating a direct effect of OA on transcriptional activity of the p65 subunit of the NF- « B complex ( Fig .
9C ) .
Transfection with the negative control plasmid pGAL4-dbd showed no enhanced promoter activity after OA treatment .
Inactive mutants of Raf-1 and JNK1 down-regulate NFkB-mediated promoter activity Since previous reports on the transcriptional activation of the IL-6 gene have emphasized the indispensability of the NF-KB binding site for the activity of the IL-6 promoter , we focussed on the involvement of the ERK1/2 and JNK1 pathways in NF- « B-depen-dent IL-6 promoter activity ( 5-7 ) .
For this purpose TE-1 cells were transiently transfected with pIL6luc ( -122 ) , comprising the NF- « B binding site only , together with either pRSV-NARaf1 or peDNA3-Flag-JNK1 , before stimulation with OA .
Previously , pRSV-NARafl , encoding a dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 , was shown to block mitogen-activated protein kinase activity by growth factors ( 35 ) .
pcDNA3-Flag-JINK1 encodes a catalytically inactive mutant of JNK 1 ( 36 ) .

Moreover , cotransfections of the pCMVlue plasmid , containing a constitutive promoter , with either pRSV-NArafl or peDNA3-Flag-JNK1 did not affect constitutive promoter activity .
These observations emphasize the specificity of the dominant negative MAP kinase constructs in inhibiting IL-6 promoter activity .
To confirm that the findings were indeed correlated with the transactivation capacity of NF-B itself and not with possible regulatory elements in the vicinity of the NF- « B binding site , TF-1 cells were simultaneously transfected with pRSV-NARafl or peDNA3-Flag-JNK1 and p ( NF- « B ) 3xCAT .
This CAT reporter plasmid solely contains three consecutive GGGAAAATCC kB binding sites adjacent to the SV40 promoter .
Again , it was demonstrated that both pRSV-NARafl and peDNA3-Flag-JNK1 impaired OA-induced « B-mediated gene transcription ( 58 + 11 % for pRSV-NARaf1 vs 100 % for peDNA3 ( p < 0.05 ) and 54 + 24 % for peDNA3-Flag-JNK1 vs 100 % for peDNA3 ( p < 0.05 ) ; Fig .

Taken together , these data would implicate a role for both the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK and the MEKK1/JNK pathways in enhancing the NF-KB transactivation capacity .

This figure is representative of two identical , independent experiments .
NF- « xB-mediated transactivation of the IL-6 promoter , but not NF- « xB DNA binding activity , is serine kinase dependent With the described results we demonstrated that both the MEKK1/ JNK and Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathways are involved in enhancing NF- « B-mediated promoter activity , but the latter pathway does not affect OA-induced NF-kB DNA binding .
This observed difference would imply an activation signal different from mere binding of NF-KB to its consensus sequence .
To resolve whether serine kinase activity may be involved in this process , transiently transfected TF-1 cells with plLéluc ( -122 ) were treated with the serine ki-nase-specific inhibitor H7 30 min before OA stimulation .
Fig .
11 is a representative of two independent experiments .
H7 was capable of reducing basal plLéluc ( -122 ) promoter activity .
More im-portantly , however , OA-induced plLéluc ( -122 ) promoter activity was blocked 10- to 100-fold by H7 , which coincided with dramatically reduced IL-6 protein secretion levels in monocytes ( Fig .
8 ) .
In contrast , band-shift assays demonstrated that the binding of NF-KB to its consensus sequence was not altered due to H7 pre-treatment , implying an essential role for serine kinase activity in regulating the transactivation potential of NF-kB ( Fig .
3 , lane 6 ) .
H7 pretreatment did inhibit AP-1 binding activity , indicating differential signaling modules involved in binding of NF-KB and AP-1 ( data not shown ) .
TAM67 , a dominant negative c-Jun , inhibits NF- « xB-mediated IL-6 promoter activity Recent work has indicated that Rel family members may interact with other transcription factors to elicit transactivation of genes .
One such example is the AP-1 complex ( 8 , 37 ) .
Since blocking the JNK pathway inhibited transactivation potential of NF- « B , we investigated whether interaction of NF- « B with c-Jun , an important downstream target of JNK1 , plays a role in transcriptional activation of the NF- « B complex .
For this purpose , we transfected TF-1 cells with the plLéluc ( -122 ) construct together with pCMV-TAM67 , the N-terminally truncated dominant negative c-Jun expression vector ( 38 ) .
The effectivity of pCMV-TAM67 was verified using a reporter containing five consecutive AP-1 binding sites ( p ( TRE ) S5xCAT ) .
The AP-1 transcription factor is composed of c-Jun and c-Fos subunits ( 39 ) .
Our experiments confirmed that reporter activity was indeed inhibited when p ( TRE ) SxCAT was ERK1/2 , JNK , AND c-Jun IN NF- « B-MEDIATED IL-6 EXPRESSION cotransfected with pCMV-TAM67 ( data not shown ) .
OA-induced NF- « B-driven IL-6 promoter activity was dramatically down-modulated after introduction of pCMV-TAM67 ( 100 % and 5.9 + 0.5 % ; p < 0.05 , respectively ) , implying a role for c-Jun in the transcriptional potential of NF- « B ( Fig .
104 ) .
To confirm that the effect elicited by pCMV-TAM67 indeed involved the NF- « B complex and not possible regulatory proteins in the vicinity of the NF-KB site , TF-1 cells were transfected with pCMV-TAM67 and p ( NF- « B ) 3xCAT simultaneously .
Overexpression of dominant negative c-Jun again strongly inhibited NF- « B-mediated promoter activity ( 28 + 7 % for pCMV-TAM67 vs 100 % for peDNA3 ; p < 0.05 ; Fig .
108 ) .
These results strongly suggest that c-Jun cooperates with NF- « B in activating a NF- « B-driven promoter element .
Discussion IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine released from activated monocytes that plays a crucial role in the immune response ( 40 ) .
In the present paper we used a chemical inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases , okadaic acid , to study the role of serine/threonine phosphorylation in intracellular signaling pathways that control IL-6 expression ( 21 ) .
Treatment of monocytes with OA resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1 ( p44Y* `` * ) and ERK2 ( p42 ~ `` ) and increased kinase activity of JNK , with concomi-tantly enhanced IL-6 protein secretion , IL-6 mRNA , and binding activity of the transcription factor NF-KB .
Both ERK1/2 and JNK belong to the family of MAPKs that are important mediators of signal transduction from cell surface receptors to the nucleus .
The three classical parallel MAP kinase cascades have been identified to date are mediated through ERK1/ERK2 ( p44Y* `` ~ and p42 ~ `` ) , JNK ( SAPK1 ) , and p38 ( RK , CSBP , MPK2 ) ( 12 , 13 ) .
In our studies , pretreatment of monocytes with PD98059 , a specific inhibitor of MEK1 , the upstream kinase from ERK1/2 , showed an inhibition of OA-induced IL-6 protein secretion from monocytes , which was not reflected by a change in NF- « B DNA binding activity ( 25 ) .
Although this would implicate involvement of the MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway in IL-6 protein secretion , this inhibition was not accomplished by altering the DNA binding properties of NF-KB .
This observation in monocytes is contradictory to reports in other cell systems describing a close association between ERK1 activity and phosphorylation and degradation of IB protein , thus leading to NF-KB activation .
Sonoda et al .
, for instance , reported in vitro phosphorylation of GST -IrB-a @ by OA-activated ERK 1 ( 41 ) .
Studies by Schouten et al .
suggested that the mitogen-activated 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase ( p90 ) is an IxBa kinase ( 42 ) .
p90 `` ' , which is a serine/threonine kinase downstream from the Raf/MEK1/ERK1/2 cascade , was shown to phosphorylate IxBa on two serine residues , i.e .
, Ser'~ and Moreover , in the lymphoblastoid cell line CEM , overexpression of either MEK 1 or ERK1 demonstrated constitutive nuclear localization of NF-KB , suggesting involvement of the classical ERK pathway in NF-KB DNA binding activity ( 15 ) .
In our cell system , however , it is unlikely that OA activates ERK 1 , which , in turn , phosphorylates IB , followed by the degradation of IB .
Rather , IxBa is phosphorylated due to OA stimulation of a pathway distinct from the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK pathway .
Recently , two upstream kinases of IxBa have been cloned , IKKa and IKK ( IxBa kinase ) ( 43 , 44 ) .
It was shown that OA inhibited a PP2A , which normally dephosphory-lates IKKa , thus leading to enhanced IxBa phosphorylation and degradation and enhanced NF-KB binding activity ( 45 ) .
This signaling route may , independently from the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway , account for the enhanced NF- « B DNA binding activity as observed after OA stimulation .
6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology Although the Raf-1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway did not affect NF- « B DNA binding activity , we clearly demonstrated that overexpression of an inactive mutant of Raf-1 inhibited NF- « B-mediated IL-6 promoter activity .
This indicates that the ERK pathway serves as an additional signaling pathway that is distinct from IB degradation , NF- « B nuclear translocation , and DNA binding , but is required for NF-KB transcriptional activation by OA .
In agreement with this observation are previous reports describing additional regulatory mechanisms , other than modulating NF- « B DNA binding properties , that enhance the transcriptional activity of NF-xB .
In this respect , serine phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF- « B as a regulatory step in the transcriptional activity of NF- « B has been reported .
Indeed , in our setting OA was capable of enhancing p65-mediated transcription from the GALA promoter .
The p65 subunit contains at least two strong transactivation domains within its C terminus ( 46 ) .
The first domain , TA1l , is contained within the last 30 amino acids of p65 , whereas TAZ comprises the adjacent 90 amino acids .
Schmitz et al .
reported that phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of a defined region within the TAZ domain were stimulated by phorbol ester treatment of cells , and thus augmented the transactivation potential of NF- « B ( 46 ) .
In a recent study the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was shown to phosphorylate p65 at a serine residue 276 , thus increasing the transactivational capacity of NF- « B without affecting nuclear translocation ( 47 ) .
Subsequently , it was demonstrated that as a result of protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation , p65 creates a site for interaction with the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 , which results in enhanced transcriptional activity ( 48 , 49 ) .
In fibroblasts and hepatoma cells IL-1-mediated NF-KB activation was accompanied by casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit on serine residues ( 50 ) .
These data are in accordance with the results of our experiments showing that NF-KB transactivation capacity , but not DNA binding , is dependent on serine kinase activity .
In our experimental setting , however , it remains unclear whether the MAPK-dependent phosphorylation effectively takes place on the p65 subunit itself .
In this regard , we demonstrated that the JNK pathway also mediated the transcriptional potential of NF-KB , both in context of the IL-6 promoter and when bound to individual NF- « B binding sites .
The JNK protein kinases phosphorylate the NH2-terminal activation domain of c-Jun on Ser and Ser'* , causing increased c-Jun transcriptional activity ( 17 ) .
Results from cotransfection studies applying plLéluc ( -122 ) or p ( NF- « kB ) 3xCAT , both containing binding sites for NF- « B only , in conjunction with pCMV-TAM67 , the NH-terminally truncated dominant negative c-Jun , suggest c-Jun/NF- « B protein/ protein interaction .
pCMV-TAM67 specifically binds to leucine zippers of endogenous Jun or Fos family proteins , forming low activity AP-1 complexes ( 51 ) .
pCMV-TAM67 binding would be expected to render the c-Jun and the c-Fos bZip domains unavailable to p65 , which requires the bZip domain for interaction .
Al-ternatively , pCMV-TAM67 may interact via its bZip domain with p65 , rendering the p65 unavailable to interact with c-Jun or c-Fos .
In our experiments pCMV-TAM67 dramatically impaired « B-driven promoter activity , strongly suggesting that either c-Jun or c-Fos may contribute to the transactivation capacity of NF-KB .
This finding is in agreement with a previous report that cross-interaction of c-Jun or c-Fos with the NF- « B subunit p65 leads to synergized potential of NF- « B transactivation ( 37 ) .
Furthermore , in a human keratinocyte progression model TAM67 was also found to inhibit the activation of NF-KB ( 52 ) .
Taking into account that 1 ) the JNK pathway affects transcriptional activity of NF-KB , and 2 ) JNK is the main activator of c-Jun , it is tempting to speculate that interaction of NF- « B with the c-Jun protein results in maximal transactivation .
Since serine kinase activity is required 4901 for the activation of c-Jun by JNK , the inhibitory effect mediated by H7 could be the consequence of impaired c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK .
In concordance , Berra and co-workers demonstrated that protein kinase CZ , a downstream substrate of Ras , triggers the activation of a number of kinases and suggested that MEK1 and ERK1/2 may also participate in NF- « B activation by enhancing the AP-1/NF- « B cross-coupling mechanism ( 53 ) .
In contrast , a recent study by Min et al .
showed that transient overexpression of an N-terminal-truncated c-Jun or a catalytically inactive JNK inhibited TNF-induced transcription of the E-selectin but not of a « B-promoter reporter gene in endothelial cells ( 54 ) .
Thus , the observation that c-Jun augments « B-dependent transcription may be cell type and stimulus specific .
We can not exclude that in our cell system , in addition to the ERK and JNK pathways , the p38 signaling route may also be involved in NF- « B activation .
In studies by vanden Berghe et al .
TNF-induced NF- « B-mediated transcription , but not NF-kB DNA binding , appeared dependent on activation of the p38/RK pathway in the mouse fibrosarcoma cell line L929sA ( 55 ) .
However , the signaling modules involved in IL-6 gene regulation are not only cell type specific , but also depend on the stimulatory signal .
More detailed study is required to elucidate the role of the additional MAPK pathways in IL-6 gene expression .
Until recently limited data existed regarding the way activated kinases might be dephosphorylated and inactivated .
Since the MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2 and JNK are involved in the regulation of IL-6 expression , the balance of MAPK kinase and MAPK phosphatase activities determines the state of activation of monocytes .
Three mammalian MAPK phosphatases have been identified until now , CL100 , PAC-1 , and Pyst-1 ( 56-59 ) .
Although their occurrence in monocytes and leukemic cell lines and the substrate specificity of these PPases have not yet been resolved , they may have important functional roles in mediating cytokine gene expression in monocytes .
We conclude that OA-induced IL-6 gene activation in monocytes is mediated through activation of the JNK and ERK1/2 pathways .
The ERK1/2 pathway was shown to be specifically involved in enhancing the transactivational capacity of NF- « B .
Both pathways may provide for serine kinase activity and c-Jun activation , which were shown to enhance « B-driven reporter gene expression in human monocytes .
