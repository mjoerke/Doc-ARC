6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor Stat6 Is Necessary and Sufficient for IL-4 's Role in Th2 Differentiation and Cell Expansion Jinfang Zhu , Liying Guo , Cynthia J. Watson , Jane Hu-Li , and William E. Paul IL-4 plays a critical role in the differentiation of TCR-stimulated naive CD4 T cells to the Th2 phenotype .
In response to IL-4 , the IL-4R activates a set of phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing proteins , including insulin receptor substrate 1/2 , She , and IL-4R interacting protein , as well as Stat6 .
Stat6 has been shown to be required for Th2 differentiation .
To determine the roles of the phosphotyrosine binding adaptors in Th2 differentiation , we prepared a retrovirus containing a mutant of the human ( h ) IL-4R « -chain , Y497F , which is unable to recruit these adaptors .
The mutant hIL-4Ra , as well as the wild-type ( WT ) hIL-4Ra , was introduced into naive CD4 T cells .
Upon hIL-4 stimulation , Y497F worked as well as the WT hIL-4Ra in driving Th2 differentiation , as measured by Gata3 up-regulation and IL-4 production .
Furthermore , IL-4-driven cell expansion was also normal in the cells infected with Y497F , although cells infected with Y497F were not capable of phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate 2 .
These results suggest that the signal pathway mediated by Y497 is dispensable for both IL-4-driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion .
Both WT and Y497F hIL-4Ra lose the ability to drive Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in Stat6-knockout CD4 T cells .
A constitutively activated form of Stat6 introduced into CD4 T cells resulted in both Th2 differentiation and enhanced cell expansion .
Thus , activated Stat6 is necessary and sufficient to mediate both IL-4-driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in CD4 T cells .

In T cells , it controls Th2 polariza- tion and acts as a costimulant of cell growth .
These functions of IL-4 are achieved through IL-4R-mediated signal transduction followed by specific gene expression ( 2 ) .
Upon IL-4 stimulation , the IL-4R a-chain ( 3 ) and the IL-2R y-chain ( 4 ) , which is also shared by cytokine receptors for IL-2 , IL-7 , IL-9 , and IL-15 , are heterodimerized .
The nonreceptor tyrosine Janus kinases 1 and 3 , constitutively associated with IL-4R « -chain ( IL-4Ra ) and IL-2R y-chain , respectively ( 5-7 ) , become activated and phosphorylate some or all of the conserved tyrosines of IL-4Ra .
These phosphotyrosines and the immediately surrounding amino acids within IL-4Ra provide docking sites for the phosphotyrosine binding-do-main ( PTBD ) * proteins insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) 1/2 ( 8-10 ) , Shc ( 11 ) , IL-4R interacting protein ( FRIP ) ( 12 ) , and dok ( 13 , 14 ) , as well as for Stat6 ( 15-18 ) .
Within the intracellular domain of human ( L ) IL-4Ra , the PTBD adapters interact with the first conserved tyrosine ( Y497 ) , and Stat6 interacts with the second , third , and fourth conserved tyrosines ( Y¥575 , Y¥603 , and Y631 ) .
Two major IL-4 signaling pathways are mediated by the PTBD proteins and Stat6 , respectively ( 18 , 19 ) .
After PTBD proteins bind to IL-4Ra , they become tyrosyl phosphorylated and provide further docking sites for other downstream molecules such as p85 of I nterleukin-4 plays a central role in regulating the behavior of Laboratory of Immunology , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD 20892 Received for publication February 1 , 2001 .

In the promyeloid cell line 32D , transfection studies have shown that IRS1 and 2 are important in IL-4-mediated cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis ( 20-22 ) .
The latter was mediated through the activation of PI-3K .
Stat6 is recruited to the IL-4R complex by binding to any of three phosphotyrosines in IL-4Ra .
It becomes tyrosyl phosphorylated at its C terminus through the action of Janus kinase ( s ) 1 and/or 3 .
Phosphorylated Stat6 dimerizes , migrates to the nucleus , binds to specific DNA elements , and , together with other transcription factors , activates transcription of some IL-4-induced genes ( 23-27 ) .
The differentiation of naive T cells into Th2 cells requires both TCR- and IL-4-mediated signals ( 28-30 ) .
IL-4 activation of Stat6 has been shown to be a critical step in driving Th2 differentiation ( 31-33 ) ; the role of IRS2 and other PTBD proteins during Th2 differentiation is unclear .
To examine a role for the PTBD proteins in IL-4-mediated Th2 differentiation and IL-4-driven proliferation in CD4 cells , we used a retrovirus ( RV ) system to introduce h wild-type ( WT ) and mutant IL-4Ra into €D4 T cells .
It was found that Y497 , the binding site for PTBD protein , is dispensable for both IL-4-driven Th2 differentiation and for cell expansion .
Using Stat6-knockout CD4 T cells , we found that Stat6 is necessary for both of these IL-4-induced functions in CD4 T cells .
Moreover , using a RV containing constitutively activated Stat6 , it was found that Stat6 is not only necessary but also sufficient for the IL-4 effects in Th2 differentiation and cell expansion .
Materials and Methods Mice and cell culture Eight- to 12-wk-old BALB/c mice were obtained from Frederick Cancer Research Center ( Frederick , MD ) .
Statb '~ BALB/c mice were originally obtained from Dr. M. Grusby ( Harvard School of Public Health , Boston , MA ) ( 33 ) .
Naive CD4 * T cells were prepared as follows : Lymph node cells were depleted of CD8 * cells , B220 * cells , and IA** cells by negative selection using FITC-labeled anti-CD8 , anti-B220 , and anti-IA `` ( BD PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) plus anti 0022-1767/01/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology fluorescein-conjugated magnetic beads ( PerSeptive Diagnostics , Cam-bridge , MA ) .
Purified CD4* T cells were then centrifuged on a discontinuous 50 , 60 , and 70 % Percoll gradient .
Cells with a density of > 60 % were collected and used for priming .
The purity of CD4* T cells was usually ~98 % .
CD44°*CD62 ligand `` cells constituted ~90 % of the purified CD4 cells .

The plasmid pcDNA3-Stat6VT containing a constitutively activated Stat6 ( Stat6VT ) was provided by Dr. U. Schindler ( Tularik , South San Francisco , CA ) ( 35 ) .
The IL-4Ra mutant , Y497F , has been described previously ( 20 ) .
The XhoI fragment of WT or mutant IL-4R « was cut from pEPS vector , cloned into the XhoI site of GFP-RV , and the orientation was verified .
The StatéVT was cut from pcDNA3-StatéVT by partial digestion with Xhol and BamHI and cloned into GFP-RV between the Bg/lI and XhoI sites .
Preparation of RVs and infection The Phoenix-Eco packaging cell line ( kindly provided by Dr. G. Nolan , Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) was transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent ( Roche Diagnostic Systems , Somerville , NJ ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Purified naive CD4 T cells ( 5 X 10° ) were activated with anti-CD3 and APCs under ThN conditions in 5 ml of medium as described above .
At 40 h , 4 ml of supernatant was removed , and 2 ml of virus-containing supernatant and polybrene ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) at 5 ug/ml was added .
The mixture was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 45 min at room temperature and incubated at 37°C for 24 h , after which 5 ml of fresh ThN medium was added .
Cells were washed and cultured in IL-2 ( 10 U/ml ) medium 3 days later for 3 additional days and then restimulated under various conditions .
For some experiments , GFP-positive cells were sorted after restimulation .
Flow cytometry analysis and intracellular staining The percentage of GFP-positive cells was determined at various times after infection .
Cells were cultured with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 6 h in the presence of monensin ( 2 uM ) during last 4 h. Harvested samples were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde , washed , and permeabilized in 0.5 % saponin-1 % BSA in PBS before staining with anti-IL-4-PE or anti-IL-4-APC .
Samples were analyzed on a FACScan ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) .
Semiquantitative RT-PCR After infection and further priming , CD4 T cells expressing GFP were sorted by FACS .
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol ( Life Technologies , Rockville , MD ) , and first strand cDNAs were made using the SuperScript preamplification system ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Semiquantitative PCR was conducted in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 ( Perkin-Elmer , Norwalk , CT ) using Platinum PCR SuperMix ( Life Technologies ) by a serial dilution of the cDNA templates .

Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting Cytokine-treated cells ( 10'/sample ) were harvested and lysed with 1 ml lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7.0 ) , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 5 mM EDTA , 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate , and 50 mM NaF ) freshly supplemented with inhibitors ( 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 1 mM PMSF , and 10 ug/ml aprotinin , leupeptin , and pepstatin ) on ice for 20 min .
After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min , supernatants were incubated with 7277 2-3 ug Ab for 1 h on ice and precipitated with protein G-agarose ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) at 4°C overnight on a rocker .
The complexes were then washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted with 2X SDS-PAGE loading buffer .
The eluted samples were separated into 8 % premade acrylamide gels ( NOVEX , San Diego , CA ) and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) .
Membranes were then probed with specific Abs followed by HRP-labeled secondary Abs ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) and visualized with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate ( Pierce ) .
For some experiments , the probed membranes were stripped with stripping buffer ( 2 % SDS , 62.5 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 6.8 ) , 100 mM 2-ME ) at 60°C for 30 min and then reprobed with a second Ab .
Anti-Stat6é was purchased from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN ) ; anti-phosphorylated tyrosine ( 4G10 ) and anti-IRS2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology ( Lake Placid , NY ) .
Results Y497 is dispensable for Th2 differentiation Within the intracellular domain of the hIL-4R -chain ( hIL-4Ra ) , Y497 recruits PTBD-containing adaptors , such as IRS1/2 ( 20 ) , Shc ( 11 ) , and FRIP ( 12 ) , when it is phosphorylated as a result of IL-4 stimulation .
The Y497F mutant of IL-4Ra was previously shown to be unable to mediate phosphorylation of IRS1/2 , Shc , and FRIP but was still capable of activating Stat6 ( 20 ) .
Thus , we used this mutant to study the roles of the PTBD-containing adaptors in Th2 differentiation .
BALB/c naive CD4 T cells were purified and activated in the presence of T cell-depleted APCs with anti-€CD3 , anti-CD28 , IL-2 , anti-IL-4 , anti-IFN-y , and anti-IL-12 ( ThN conditions ) for 40 h. The activated cells were then infected with RVs containing either WT hIL-4Ra or Y497F or with the empty vector as a control .
Cells were maintained under ThN conditions for 3 additional days and then washed and placed in IL-2 medium for 3 days .
The percentage of GFP-positive cells was checked by FACS .
The infected cells were then split into three populations and further primed under ThN , Th2 , or ThN plus hIL-4 ( 10 ng/m ! )
conditions for 4 days .
The percentage of IL-4-producing cells was measured by intracellular staining after an additional 3-day culture in IL-2 .
Under the ThN conditions , the GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells from each of the infected groups made little IL-4 ( 1.1-4.9 % ; Fig .
1 ) .
Under Th2 conditions , the GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells from each of the infected groups developed IL-4-producing capacity to a similar degree and had indistinguishable percentages of IL-4 producers ( 13.6 vs 14.2 % , 14.3 vs 14.5 % , and 19.4 vs 18.8 % ) .
Under the ThN plus hIL-4 condition , 23.8 % of the GFP-positive cells expressing WT hIL-4Ra were capable of making IL-4 , whereas only 2.9 % of GFP-negative cells from the same culture could produce IL-4 .
Interestingly , 23.7 % of the GFP cells from the group infected with theY497F RV could produce IL-4 , a percentage that was essentially the same as those that had been infected with the WT receptor RV .
GFP-positive cells from the group infected with empty vector developed very few ( 1.9 % ) IL-4 producers .
The results indicate that Y497 is not required for IL-4 stimulation of CD4 T cells to become IL-4 producers .
Because Gata3 is a key transcription factor in the Th2 differentiation of CD4 T cells ( 36 ) , and infection with a Gata3 RV has been reported to replace the need for IL-4 in Th2 differentiation ( 37 ) , we checked the expression level of Gata3 in our primed cells .
The GFP-positive cells from the groups infected with either WT or Y497F RVs that had been stimulated under ThN plus hIL-4 conditions were purified by cell sorting .
The expression levels of Gata3 , measured by RT-PCR , were the same in the groups expressing the WT and the Y497F hIL-4R « -chain ( Fig .
2 ) .
They were similar to expression levels in conventionally primed Th2 cells and ~10-fold higher than expression levels in conventionally primed ThN cells .

Y497 is dispensable for IL-4-mediated development of IL-4-producing capacity .
BALB/c naive CD4 T cells were purified and activated in the presence of T cell-depleted APCs with anti-CD3 , anti-CD28 , IL-2 , anti-IL-4 , anti-IFN- , and anti-IL-12 ( ThN conditions ) for 40 h. The activated cells were then infected with RVs containing either WT hIL-4Ra or Y497F or with the empty vector as a control .
Cells were maintained under ThN conditions for 3 additional days and then washed and placed in IL-2 medium for 3 days .
The infected cells were then split into three populations and further primed under ThN , Th2 , or ThN plus hIL-4 ( 10 ng/m ! )
conditions for 4 days .
The percentage of GFP* and GFP~ IL-4-producing CD4 cells was measured by intracellular staining after 3 additional days of culture in IL-2 .
These results strongly support the conclusions that Y497 of hIL-4Ra is dispensable for IL-4-mediated Th2 differentiation .
Y497 is dispensable for IL-4-mediated cell expansion Cells being primed under Th2 conditions expand to a greater degree than those stimulated under ThN or Th1 conditions , and the addition of IL-4 to cultures of naive CD4 T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 , anti-CD28 , and IL-2 markedly enhances cell yield ( 38 ) .
By infecting naive CD4 T cells with hIL-4Ra RV , we could compare the relative IL-4-mediated expansion of GFP-positive and GFP -negative cells .
Relative GFP */GFP_- expansion was defined as ( percentage of GFP * cells after priming ) X ( percentage of GFP_ cells after infection ) / ( percentage of GFP * cells after infection ) / ( percentage of GFP_ cells after priming ) .
Under Th2 priming conditions , both GFP * and GFP_ cells from the groups infected with any of the vectors expanded equally , resulting in relative expansions of 1.1-1.3 ( Fig .
3 ) .
This would be anticipated because all the cells can respond to the mouse IL-4 that is present .
Under ThN plus hIL-4 or Th1 plus hIL-4 conditions , the GFP * cells from the culture infected with the empty vector lacking hIL-4R could not respond to hIL-4 .
Thus , the percentage of GFP * cells remained the same after priming .
However , under ThN plus hIL-4 or Th1 plus hIL-4 conditions , the GFP* cells from the culture infected with WT hIL-4Ra grew much better than the GFP_ cells in the same culture .
The relative expansions were 4.0 and 4.7 , respectively , in experiment 1 and 4.2 and 4.5 in experiment 2 .
Interestingly , the similar results were observed in the cells infected with Y497F hIL-4Ra mutant .
The relative expansion in the ThN plus hIL-4 and the Th1 plus hIL-4 stimulated cells were 3.9 and 5.7 , respectively , in experiment 1 and 4.5 and 5.0 in experiment 2 .

Y497 is dispensable for IL-4-mediated induction of Gata3 expression .
The GFP* cells that developed as a result of ThN plus hIL-4-priming of cells from the groups infected with either WT or Y497F RVs ( as shown in the right panels of Fig .

The expression levels of Gata3 and B-actin were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR .
Conventionally primed ThN and Th2 cells were used as negative and positive controls .
not only dispensable for Th2 differentiation , it was also not essential for IL-4-induced T cell expansion .
Y497 is important for IRS2 phosphorylation in CD4 T cells IRS2 phosphorylation can be dramatically induced by IL-4 in either naive or activated CD4 T cells ( 39 ) .
Although it has been shown that IL-4-induced IRS1/2 phosphorylation was greatly diminished in the promyeloid cell line 32D-IRS1 transfected with Y497F compared with those transfected with WT IL-4Ra ( 20 ) , we wished to determine whether that is also the case in CD4 T cells .
GFP * cells were purified , by cell sorting , from CD4 T cell populations infected with either WT IL-4Ra RV or the Y497F RV .
To obtain sufficient cells for analysis and to increase expression of IRS2 in these cells , the sorted cells were subjected to two further rounds of priming under Th2 conditions .
Upon mouse IL-4 stimulation , IRS2 and Stat6 were well phosphorylated in both cell populations ( Fig .
4 ) .
In the cells expressing WT hIL-4Ra « , IRS2 and Stat6 became phosphorylated upon hIL-4 stimulation .
However , in cells expressing the Y497F mutant , although Stat6 phosphorylation remained normal , IRS2 phosphorylation was greatly diminished in response to hIL-4 .

Y497 is important for IL-4-mediated IRS2 phosphorylation in CD4 T cells .
GFP* cells were purified by cell sorting from populations of CD4 T cells that had been infected with either the WT IL-4R « or the Y497F mutant RV .
They were further primed under Th2 conditions for two additional rounds .
Cells were washed , cultured in serum-free medium for 4 h , and then stimulated with mouse IL-4 , hIL-4 , or nothing for 20 min .
Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-IRS2 or anti-Stat6 .
SDS-PAGE was performed and immunobotting with anti-phosphorylated tyrosine ( 4G10 ) or anti-IRS2 was conducted .
The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-Stat6 .
to be required for mediating either of these two IL-4 functions in CD4 T cells .
Stat6 is required for both IL-4-driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion It has been shown that Stat6 is crucial for Th2 differentiation ( 31-33 ) , but its function in IL-4-driven T cell proliferation is not clear .
We infected CD4 T cells from Stat6-knockout mice with the hIL-4Ra , the Y497F , and `` empty `` RVs and measured relative expansion .
Under ThN conditions with added hIL-4 , the relative expansions were 0.9-1.3 ( Fig .
5 ) .
In the same experiments , the relative expansions taken from BALB/c cells infected with hIL-4Ra were 4.4 and 3.8 .
The Stat6 '~ cells also underwent little or no differentiation to IL-4-producing cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , Stat6 is required for both IL-4-driven Th2 differentiation and for CD4 T cell expansion .
Stat6 activation is sufficient for anti-CD3-stimulated Th2 differentiation and cell expansion Recently , a constitutively active Stat6 mutant ( Stat6VT ) has been derived ( 35 ) .
We used this mutant to test whether Stat6 activation is sufficient in combination with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 to drive Th2 differentiation and cell expansion .
After cloning this mutant into our retroviral vector , we infected anti-CD3/anti-CD28-activated T cells with WT hIL-4Ra RV , Stat6VT RV , or empty vector RV .

The infected cells were then stimulated for 4 additional days under ThN conditions in the presence of hIL-4 .
The percentage of GFP * cells was measured by FACS after 3 days of culture in IL-2 .
The results of two independent experiments are shown .
7279 After infection , the cells infected with IL-4Ra « RV were primed under ThN conditions with hIL-4 ; cells infected with empty vector RV and StatéVT RV were primed under ThN conditions in the absence of hIL-4 .
As shown in Fig .
6 , in two independent experiments , the GFP- and GFP * cells infected with empty vector RV made little IL-4 ( 0.9 and 0.4 % and 0.2 and 0.2 % ) .
The GFP- and GFP * cells from cultures infected with hIL-4Ra RV had very different percentages of IL-4-producing cells ( 1.4 vs 11.4 % and 0.6 vs 24.5 % ) .
The cells infected with Stat6VT RV and primed in the absence of IL-4 showed a similar pattern .
In the two experiments presented , 1.4 and 0.1 % of the GFP_ cells produced IL-4 compared with 16.2 and 28.7 % of the GFP * cells .
All the cells cultured under Th2 conditions with mouse IL-4 developed a substantial proportion of IL-4-producing cells ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , cells expressing Stat6VT showed an IL-4-independent relative expansion similar to the IL-4-dependent relative expansion of those expressing hIL-4Ra ( 5.5- and 4.1-fold , respec-tively ; similar results were obtained in a second experiment in which we observed 5.1- and 4.4-fold relative expansion ) ( Fig .
7 ) .
These results strongly support the conclusion that Stat6 is not only necessary but also sufficient to drive IL-4-mediated Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in naive CD4 T cells .
Discussion Prior transfection studies in the promyeloid cell line 32D indicated a major role for the first conserved tyrosine in the cytosolic domain of the IL-4R a-chain ( Y497 ) in IL-4-mediated cell proliferation and survival ( 20-22 ) .
This tyrosine is in a docking site for PTBD proteins ; 32D cells lack IRS1 and IRS2 , two of the major PTBD proteins that normally interact with the Y497 site .
Mouse IL-4 fails to stimulate the growth of WT 32D cells but does stimulate the growth of such cells transfected with cDNAs for IRS1 or IRS2 .
Moreover , most 32D-IRS1 cell lines expressing the hIL-4Ra mutant Y497F fail to grow in response to hIL-4 .
Thus , it was concluded that in this promeyloid cell line , PTBD proteins docking to phosphorylated Y497 play a major role in cell growth and resistance to apoptosis .
The applicability of these findings to normal cells and to naive T cells in particular was uncertain .

The results of two independent experiments are shown .
The combination of two signals mediated by TCR and IL-4R leads to Th2 differentiation .
Recently , it has been shown that Th2 differentiation can occur independently of IL-4-IL-4R-Stat6 in vivo ( 40 , 41 ) .
Indeed , even in in vitro culture , a small portion of cells may undergo Th2 differentiation independently of the IL-4-IL-4R-Stat6 pathway ( 37 ) .
It is likely that any set of signals that leads to Gata3 expression results in Th2 differentiation .
However , it is clear from studies using cells from Staté-deficient mice that Stat6 plays a dominant role in IL-4-mediated Th2 differentiation ( 31-33 ) and in the T cell expansion over a 3- to 5-day period that occurred under Th2 culture conditions .
Stat6 interacts with the second , third , and fourth conserved tyrosines ( Y575 , Y¥603 , and Y631 ) of IL-4Ra ( 2 , 17 , 18 ) .
The role of the PTBD adapters that interact with Y497 in T cell responses to IL-4 was uncertain .
Here we have shown that Stat6 appears to be both necessary and sufficient to mediate the IL-4 component of Th2 differentiation .
The finding that T cells expressing a mutant hIL-4R « -chain ( Y497F ) that can not interact with PTBDs are nonetheless fully competent to differentiate into IL-4-producing cells under the influence of hIL-4 establishes this point .
What was more surprising was the finding that the PTBD proteins did not appear to play a major role in the expansion of CD4 T cells stimulated under Th2-inducing conditions .
CD4 T cells expressing the Y497F mutant hIL-4R « -chain were as competent as those expressing WT receptors in such expansion .
Not only were the PTBD proteins not important in this expansion or in Th2 differentiation , Stat6 was required for both .
CD4 T cells from Stat6-deficient mice failed to polarize to IL-4 production or to show IL-4-dependent expansion when cultured under Th2 conditions .
Arai and colleagues had previously infected CD4 cells stimulated under Thl conditions with a RV containing a cDNA for a Stat6-estrogen receptor fusion protein .
Dimerizing the fusion protein with the estrogen analog 4-hydroxytamoxifen activated Stat6 , resulting in the induction of Th2 cytokines in the developing cells and an increase in their uptake of [ °H ] thymidine ( 42 ) .
Our experiments using StatéVT ( 35 ) , a constitutively active Stat-6 mutant , showed that Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in the absence of IL-4 were equivalent to the IL-4-driven differentiation and expansion of cells expressing the WT hIL-4Ra « .
Thus , activated Stat6 appears to be fully responsible for mediating the IL-4-induced Th2 polarization and cell expansion .
The failure to observe any difference in the behavior of CD4 T cells expressing the WT or the Y497F mutant hIL-4R « -chains is Stat6 IS SUFFICIENT FOR IL-4 FUNCTION IN T CELLS not likely to be accounted for by over-expression of the hIL-4R in such cells .
Immunoblotting studies failed to show more receptors on these cells than on Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
In addition , we saw no difference in the relative induction of IL-4-producing cells among those that expressed large amounts of GFP and those that expressed small amounts of GFP .
Because relative GFP expression levels should correlate with relative IL-4R expression levels using a RV containing both cDNAs , there does not appear to be a correlation between the number of expressed receptors and the magnitude of the response .
The role that PTBD proteins such as IRS2 play in T cell responses needs to be further clarified .
We did show that cells expressing the Y497F mutant failed to phosphorylate IRS2 in response to IL-4 , whereas cells expressing the WT hIL-4R a-chain showed quite clear phosphorylation of this adaptor .
Whether the PTBD proteins play an important role in controlling resistance to apoptosis early in their response to IL-4 is an interesting possibil-ity .
However , this was quite difficult to test in the retroviral infection system , because truly naive T cells are resistant to infection ( activation is required for successful T cell infection in the retroviral system ) .
Furthermore , primed CD4 T cells tend to survive quite well .
It is possible that IL-4 sparing of T cell apoptosis before new gene activation is dependent on PTBD proteins , but determining whether this is true will require additional study .
Other potential IL-4R-mediated functions , such as cell adhesion , cell mi-gration , and cell-cell interactions , will need to be studied for the relative importance of PTBD proteins .
The Stat6-dependent induction and activation of Gata3 in response to IL-4 is well established as playing a central role in Th2 differentiation ( 31-34 , 36 , 37 ) .
Because activated Stat6 is sufficient to mediate both IL-4-driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion , it will be interesting to determine whether Gata3 also contributes to IL-4-driven cell proliferation or whether this Stat6 effect is Gata3 independent .
