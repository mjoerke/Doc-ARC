5668-5673 , May 1999 Immunology Defining therapeutic targets by using adenovirus : Blocking NF-rB inhibits both inflammatory and destructive mechanisms in rheumatoid synovium but spares anti-inflammatory mediators JAN BONDESON , BRIAN FOXWELL , FIONULA BRENNAN , AND MARC FELDMANN®* Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology , 1 Aspenlea Road , Hammersmith , London W6 8LH , United Kingdom Edited by Anthony Cerami , The Kenneth S. Warren Laboratories , Tarrytown , NY , and approved March 24 , 1999 ( received for review January 25 , 1999 ) ABSTRACT The role of the transcription factor NF-KB in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis has long been a subject of controversy .
We used an adenoviral technique of blocking NF-KB through overexpression of the inhibitory subunit IxBa , which has the advantage that it can be used in the diseased tissue itself , with > 90 % of the synovial macrophages , fibroblasts , and T cells infected .
We found that the spontaneous production of tumor necrosis factor a and other pro-inflammatory cytokines is NF- « B-dependent in rheumatoid synovial tissue , in contrast to the main anti-inflammatory mediators , like IL-10 and -11 , and the IL-1 receptor antago-nist .
Of even more interest , I « Ba overexpression inhibited the production of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 while not affecting their tissue inhibitor .
Blocking NF-xB in the rheumatoid joint thus has a very beneficial profile , reducing both the inflammatory response and the tissue destruction .
The adenoviral technique described here has widespread applica-bility , allowing rapid testing of the effects of blocking a potential therapeutic target in either cultures of normal cells or in the diseased tissue itself .
Despite the success of recent clinical trials of anti-tumor necrosis factor a ( TNFa ) therapy in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , based on the prior finding that TNFa was of pivotal importance ( 1-6 ) , there are a number of unresolved questions concerning the pathogenesis of RA .
One is whether the mechanism of joint inflammation ( synovitis ) and destruction are the same or whether these processes are regulated differ-ently .
Contrasting opinions concerning this have been argued forcefully : For example , one school of thought suggests that , although TNFa is the cytokine controlling synovitis , IL-1 is the dominant cytokine implicated in cartilage destruction ( 7 ) .
Another variant suggests that the fibroblast-like cells in the joint , its major source of destructive enzymes , have acquired an autonomous `` tumor-like `` invasive phenotype and are not regulated in the same manner as the synovitis ( 8 ) .
Transplantation experiments of synovial fibroblasts and cartilage into severe combined immunodeficient mice are used to argue this point ( 9 ) .
The prediction from these experiments is that anti-TNF therapy will , as observed in trials , control signs and symptoms of inflammation but may not prevent structural damage and consequential deterioration of physical function in the long term .
The anti-TNF trials reported so far have been too brief to resolve this controversy .
A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of RA would help determine how to improve on antirheumatic therapy .

5668 the study of animal models of complex multigenic disease can only reveal clues as to the actual mechanisms operating in authentic human disease .
We have begun to use an approach , applicable in either normal cells or pathological tissues from diseased sites , which permits the inhibition of selected intracellular molecular pathways .
Blockade is achieved through our effective method of adenoviral gene transfer into normal human macrophages ( 10 , 11 ) .
This method has now enabled us to analyze in detail the effects of NF- « B blockade in rheumatoid synovium , which demonstrates that major destructive enzymes , chiefly produced by fibroblasts , are just as dependent on NF-KB as the pro-inflammatory cytokines produced mainly by macrophages .
These results suggest that there are major similarities in the key intracellular pathways in the cells most closely involved with synovitis , the macrophages , and tissue destruction , the fibroblasts .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
Synovium from patients with RA undergoing joint surgery was dissociated by cutting into small pieces and was digested with collagenase and DNase ( 12 ) .
The total cell mixture was cultured at 37°C in RPMI medium 1640 with 25 mM Hepes and 2 mM L-glutamine , supplemented with 5 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum , on 24- or 48-well plates .

After 2 h , the supernatants were removed and replaced with 0.5 ml of RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 5 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum .
The nonadherent cells were carefully spun down and were reintroduced to the rheumatoid cell coculture in 0.5 ml of RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 5 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( total volume , thus , of 1 ml ) .
In some experiments , rheumatoid synovial cells were infected as above , but at a density of 0.4 million cells per well in a final volume of 0.2 ml , on a 96-well plate .
Four wells of cells from each category-uninfected , AdvO-infected , and AdvlI « kBa-infected-were plated .
After incubation with adenovirus for 2 h , one well from each category was untreated , one was treated with 20 ug/ml of human recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist ( Cambridge Bioscience , Cambridge , U.K. ) , one was treated with 20 ug/ml of the AZ anti-TNFa antibody ( Centocor ) , and one was treated with both of these cytokine inhibitors .
For infectibility experiments , cells were resuspended in 0.6 ml of serum-free RPMI medium1640 on a 24-well plate at 1 million cells per well .
After incubation for 1 h , they either were left uninfected or were infected with Adv @ gal or AdvO at a multiplicity of infection of 40:1 .
After 2 h , the supernatants were removed and replaced with 0.4 ml of RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 5 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum .
The nonadherent cells were carefully spun down and were reintroduced to the rheumatoid cell coculture in 0.2 ml of RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 5 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( total volume of 0.6 ml ) .
Analysis of Infectibility .
Cell were scraped off the plates in the culture medium 48 h after infection and were spun down and washed in fluorescence-activated cell sorter staining solution as described ( 15 ) .
Each batch of uninfected , AdvO-infected , or AdvBgal-infected cells then was resuspended in 25 pl of staining solution and was incubated with 125 ng of anti-CD3 PerCP and 500 ng of anti-CD14 PE ( both from Becton Dickinson ) , in a total volume of 45 pl for 45 min at 4°C .
They then were incubated at 37°C for 10 min , before 45 pl of a 2 mM solution of Fluorescein di- ( B-D ) -galactopyranoside ( Sigma ) was added for 1 min .
Addition of excess ( 10 % ) ice-cold staining solution was used to stop the reaction .
Cell fluorescence was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter as described ( 16 ) .
Analysis of Cytokines and Metalloproteases .
In the assays for cytokine production , supernatants were taken off , and nonadherent cells were removed 48 h after infection .
They were analyzed for TNFa ( 17 ) , IL-1 , IL-6 , and IL-8 ( 18 ) , IL-10 ( 19 , 20 ) , IL-11 ( 21 ) , and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1ra ) and the p75 soluble TNF receptor ( 22 ) by ELISA .
The production of matrix metalloproteinase type 1 ( MMP 1 ) ( Collagenase ) , MMP 3 ( Stromelysin ) , and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases ( TIMP-1 ) was analyzed by ELISA kits purchased from Amersham Pharmacia .
In some experiments , aliquots of 50 ul were taken off after 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 , and 110 h. After the nonadherent cells had been removed and reintroduced to the cells in the same amount of medium , these aliquots were analyzed for cytokines and metalloproteases as described above .
Western Blotting .
In this experiment , three batches of 10 x 10° cells each either were left uninfected or were infected with Adv0 or Advi « kBa .
Two days after infection , cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described ( 23 ) , and proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE on a 10 % ( wt/vol ) polyacryl-amide gel , followed by electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes .
IxBa and the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases were detected by using antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
Statistical Methods .
All statistical testing was performed by using a one-sided , paired-comparisons Student 's ¢ test .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) 5669 RESULTS Infectibility of Rheumatoid Synovial Cells with Adenovirus .
Infectibility of cells derived from rheumatoid synovial tissue was investigated by using the AdvBGal adenovirus .
Because 40:1 of AdvBGal infected 95-100 % of human macrophages ( 10 ) and 30:1 of AdvBGal infected nearly 100 % of human fibroblasts ( J.B. , F.B .
, B.F. , and MF .
, unpublished work ) , we decided to use 10:1 and 40:1 of AdvBGal in initial experiments .
It was found that 40:1 of AdvBGal infected nearly 100 % of the entire rheumatoid synovial cell population ( Fig .
14 ) but that 10:1 infected only 60-70 % ( data not shown ) .
All subsequent experiments thus used a multiplicity of infection of 40:1 of AdvBGal and other adenoviruses .
Because the rheumatoid synovium is a complex mixture of cells , it was of interest to study the infectibility of each of the main constituents , macrophages , T lymphocytes , and synovio-cytes .
This was performed through preincubating the cells with fluorescent antibody markers to CD3 and CD14 , which allowed identification of CD3+/CD14- ( T lymphocytes ) , CD14+/CD3- ( macrophages ) , and CD3-/CD14- ( chiefly synovial fibroblast ) populations .
By using human peripheral blood T cells and monocytes and human skin fibroblasts as controls , the forward scatter/side scatter characteristics of these cell populations could be identified .
Double gating then was used to ensure that the rheumatoid synovial cell populations chosen to represent T lymphocytes , macrophages , and synoviocytes had the correct size/granularity as well as the CD3- CD14- _ ' E i. R CD14+ CD3 CD3+ CD14- hm 20 f C 4.0 60 so 100 % cells positive for Beta-gal F IxBa A p42/44 MAPK Uninfected AdvO 40:1 - AdvikBa 40:1 Fig .

In excess of 90 % of rheumatoid synovial cells can be infected with adenovirus .
B-galactosidase activity in total rheumatoid synovial membrane cell cultures ( 4 ) , T lymphocytes ( B ) , macrophages ( C ) , or synoviocytes ( D ) were detected by double gating for size/ granularity and cell surface markers , in cultures infected with 40:1 of either AdvO ( broken line ) or Advf @ gal ( solid line } .
Shown is a representative of five experiments .
In E , the means of B-galactosidase-positive cells are plotted + SEM ( # = 5 ) .
In F , rheumatoid synovial cells were infected with 40:1 of either AdvO or AdviIkBa , and cytosolic extracts were prepared .
IxBa expression was determined by Western blotting , and the expression of the p42-44 mitogen-activated protein kinases was used as a control .
5670 Immunology : Bondeson et al surface marker characteristics .
As could be expected from earlier results , both macrophages ( Fig .
1C ) and fibroblasts ( Fig .
1D ) were easy to infect ; surprisingly , > 90 % of the T lymphocytes in the synovium also were infected by 40:1 of AdvBGal ( Fig .
1B ) .
It was also possible to demonstrate that infection of rheumatoid synovial cells with 40:1 of AdvI « Ba , but not AdvO , was able to induce considerable cytosolic overexpression of IxBa ( Fig .
1F ) .
The amount of nuclear protein available in these limited amounts of tissue did not permit either Western analysis of nuclear IxBa or electrophoretic mobility shift studies of NF- « B function , which has been reported earlier with this virus by using human macrophages ( 10 , 11 ) .
IxBa Overexpression Inhibits the Production of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines .
It has been demonstrated that the spontaneous production of TNFa , by rheumatoid synovium as assessed two days after infection , was inhibited by 70 % in cells infected with Advl « Ba , as compared with mock-infected cells or cells infected with AdvO ( 10 ) .
Here , we demonstrate that the spontaneous production of both IL-1 ( Fig .
24 ) and IL-8 ( Fig .
2B ) also was inhibited significantly ( P < 0.01 ) by IxBa over-expression , but to a more modest degree ( 40 % , as compared with uninfected or AdvO-infected cells ) .
In contrast , IL-6 was inhibited very potently ( P < 0.001 ) ( 85 % ; Fig .
2C ) .
These results agree with previous findings in normal macrophages identifying IL-6 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine strongly dependent on transcriptional regulation by NF-kB 11 ) .
In a separate series of experiments , aliquots of medium from cultured cells from rheumatoid synovial membranes were removed after 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 , and 110 h , and cytokine analysis was performed .
It was seen ( Fig .
3 ) that , although the production of TNFa and IL-6 from uninfected or AdvO-infected cells gradually increased between day 1 and day 5 , the cytokine production from AdviI « Ba-infected cells remained almost static , indicating that , once sufficient over-expression of IxBa had been achieved to inhibit NF- « B activation , only very little TNFa and IL-6 is produced .
IxBa Overexpression Does Not Affect the Production of the Major Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines and Mediators .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) 5671 ( Fig .
5 4 and B ) that IxBa overexpression potently inhibited ( P < 0.001 ) the spontaneous production of both MMP 1 and MMP 3 in rheumatoid synovial cells .
These MMPs were assayed because there is evidence that they are produced in RA joints and are important mediators in joint destruction ( 25-28 ) ; quantitative ELISA assays are available to measure their biosynthesis .
In contrast , the spontaneous production of their inducible inhibitor , TIMP-1 , was not significantly affected after 2 days ( Fig .
5C ) .
Furthermore , while studying a time-course of MMP production ( Fig .
64 and B ) , it appears that , although uninfected and AdvO-infected rheumatoid synovial cell cocultures continue producing these enzymes throughout the incubation period , the AdvI « Ba-infected cells produce very little of either MMP 1 or MMP 3 after significant IxBa overexpression has been achieved .
Again , there is a remarkable contrast to the strong potentiation of TIMP-1 production seen after 3 or 5 days ( Fig .
6C ) .
The results in Figs .
5-6 indicate direct or indirect dependence of NF-KB for the production of both MMP 1 and MMP 3 , but not for TIMP-1 .
Both IL-1 and TNFa are known inducers of MMPs , however , and to examine the influence of the down-regulation of these two cytokines on MMP production , a series of experiments was performed with addition of IL-1ra and/or a TNFa neutralizing antibody just after infection of cells .
It was seen ( Fig .
74 ) that , although IL-1 turned out to be a major inducer of MMP 1 , the relative inhibition of MMP 1 by IxBa over-expression was largely unaffected by neutralization of either IL-1 or TNFa .

Effect of AdvI « Ba infection on MMP and TIMP production in rheumatoid synovial cell cultures in which IL-1 and/or TNFa were neutralized .
Rheumatoid synovial cells were either left uninfected or infected with 40:1 of Adv0 or AdvI « Ba .
After the virus was taken off and culture medium was added , the cells in each of the three categories either were left untreated or were treated with 20 ug/ml of the IL-1 receptor antagonist and/or 20 ug/ml of the A2 anti-TNFa antibody .
The spontaneous production of MMP 1 ( 4 ) , MMP 3 ( B ) , and TIMP-1 ( C ) was assayed after 2 days .
Shown is a representative of three complete experiments .
5672 Immunology : Bondeson et al IL-1 through IxBa overexpression ( Fig .
24 ) may contribute , it appears that MMP 1 is ~50 % under direct NF-KB control ( see Fig .
74 ; in the presence of IL-1ra , there is still 50 % inhibition in Advl « Ba-infected cells ) , although it can not be definitely ruled out that indirect effects on some other soluble mediator might be involved .
MMP 3 was even more potently driven by IL-1 ( Fig .
7B ) .
Neutralization of IL-1 removed the inhibition of MMP 3 seen in AdvI « Ba-infected cells , indicating that the majority of the MMP 3 down-regulation by IxBa overexpression is caused by inhibition of IL-1 .
Although TIMP-1 appeared to be partly IL-1 driven ( Fig .
7C ) , AdvI « Ba had little effect on TIMP-1 production under either of the conditions studied .
DISCUSSION The genetic approach to studying cell signaling pathways has many advantages and has led to marked progress and deeper understanding of signal transduction ( 29 , 30 ) .
However , this only applies to cells that are easy to transfect efficiently , for example , cell lines such as CV-1 origin SV-40 ( COS ) , Chinese hamster ovary , 293 , or Jurkat cells .
It is assumed , or hoped , that other cell types will conform to the principles determined in cell lines .
There are a number of reasons why this may not be the case , which prompted us to develop a method of using adenovirus to introduce genes into effectively all ( > 95 % ) normal human macrophages , thus permitting us to study the effects of blocking signaling pathways in these cells , which are of major importance in chronic inflammation ( 10 ) .
Here , we have extended the use of adenoviral gene transfer and have demonstrate that all major cell types in a pathological site , the rheumatoid synovium , are infected at a very high frequency .
This means that adenovirus is a useful tool for studying not only signaling in the macrophages , but also the T lymphocytes and cells lacking markers of T cells or macrophages , which would include mainly fibroblasts with some dendritic cells and endothelium ( Fig .
1 ) .
The marked infectibility of T cells from the rheumatoid joint was surprising in view of reports in the literature of low infectibility of in vitro activated T lymphocytes ( 31 ) .
However , other authors ( 32 , 33 ) have reported greater infectibility , provided that a targeting antibody was used ; it is possible that the exact state of activation of the T lymphocyte , and which integrins and other receptors are expressed , is of importance for increasing infectability .
The degree of reduction in synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA synovium treated with AdvI « Ba varied with the cytokine assayed .
At 48 h after infection , IL-18B and IL-8 production was reduced by 40 % whereas TNFa was reduced by 75 % and IL-6 was reduced by 85 % .
Kinetic studies for the latter two show that the exact degree of inhibition varies with time and sample of diseased tissue .
However , the differential degree of inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by NF- « B blockade suggests that there are both NF- « B-dependent and NF- « B-independent pathways involved in regulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in the rheumatoid joint .
It will be of interest to analyze what these other important transcription factors are .
Both activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) and NF-IL-6 are likely candidates .
That there are indeed both NF- « B-dependent and -independent pathways of inducing TNFa and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages has been clearly demonstrated by using AdvlI « Ba as an inhibitor : Although lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFa was NF- « B-dependent in human macrophages , zymosan-induced TNFa was not ( 11 ) , and there are NF- « B-independent pathways of inducing TNFa also in T lymphocytes ( 34 ) .
It has been reported that , in active RA synovium , both pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory mediators such as TGFR1 , IL-10 , IL-1ra , and the soluble TNF-receptors are up-regulated and spontaneously produced ( 35 ) .
Because there is persistent disease despite the production of these Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 96 ( 1999 ) anti-inflammatory molecules , the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines predominate ; it is thus of great interest that the effect of NF-kB blockade was markedly different on pro-inflammatory mediators than on anti-inflammatory .
There was no effect on IL-10 or IL-lra production , some modest up-regulation of IL-11 , and only a moderate reduction of the p75 soluble TNF-R , assayed two days after AdvI « Ba infection .
Because the p75 soluble TNF-R is markedly up-regulated by pro-inflammatory mediators ( lipopolysaccharide and 4 $ -phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) as well as IL-1 and TNFa ) ( 36 ) , it is possible that much of the inhibition seen in p75 is secondary to the reduced inflammatory effects after AdvI « kBa infection .
Many symptoms in patients with RA-pain , stiffness , and joint swelling-depend on pro-inflammatory cytokines , as judged by the rapid onset of benefit after anti-TNFa therapy ( 1-6 ) .
Just as important , if not more so , is the process of joint destruction .
In mice with collagen induced arthritis or with a disregulated TNFa transgene , there is joint destruction that can be abolished by blocking TNFa and other pro-inflammatory cytokines ( 37-39 ) .
However , whether this is the case in RA is not yet clear .
The identity of the enzymes involved in the breakdown of human articular cartilage , composed primarily of collagen type II and proteoglycans , in RA has been the focus of multiple studies during the last decades and is still a subject of debate ( 25 ) .
There is evidence that MMPs , in particular MMP 1 , MMP 13 , and the membrane-bound MMPs , are capable of cleaving collagen type II ( 40 , 41 ) .
MMP 3 lacks this capacity but does have activity against other components of the extracellular matrix , including proteoglycans , fibronectin , and laminin ( 25 ) .
The involvement of MMP 3 or other MMP enzymes in proteoglycan cleavage is still a matter of debate .
AP-1 has been proposed as the dominant transcription factor for the regulation of MMP 1 and MMP 3 because there are AP-1 sites on both promoters and deletion of AP-1 site ( s ) inhibited MMP gene activation ( 42 ) .
Also , certain agents that block AP-1 also inhibit the synthesis of MMP 1 and MMP 3 ( 42 , 43 ) .
Other authors ( 44-46 ) have demonstrated AP-1-independent mechanisms of MMP 1 and MMP 3 induction , however , and some recent studies ( 47-49 ) have discussed whether NF-kB might play a role in MMP 1 induction .
We investigated whether NF- « B blockade modulated the synthesis of MMP enzymes or TIMP-1 , the inducible tissue inhibitor of MMPs , which binds covalently and irreversibly inactivates the enzymatic site of MMPs .
AdvI « kBa markedly inhibited the degradative enzymes MMP 1 and MMP 3 but had no effect on TIMP-1 .
Hence , the destructive potential of the synovium is markedly reduced with NF- « B blockade .
It is interesting to note , in this context , that the promoter element of MMP 1 has several NF- « B sites ( 47 , 50 , 51 ) and that our own data indicate that MMP 1 is NF- « B-dependent in fibroblasts and chondro-sarcoma cells ( J.B. , F.B .
, B.F. , and MF .
, unpublished work ) , which do not produce IL-1 and TNFa .
The MMP 3 promoter has just one site ( GenBank accession no .
U43511 ) , and it is not clear whether the inhibition of MMP 3 seen after Advi « kBa infection is direct or indirect , just reflecting the reductions in IL-1 and TNFa ( Fig .
7 ) .
The results presented here indicate that blocking NF-kB in rheumatoid joints would have an uniquely beneficial profile-within 2 days , there is marked reduction in the pro-inflammatory cytokines , without a concomitant reduction in the anti-inflammatory mediators .
This should have a markedly beneficial effect on the synovitis especially in the light of the considerable `` downstream `` effects of blocking the single cytokine TNFa , as discussed ( 5 , 35 ) .
Just as importantly , the destructive metalloproteinase enzymes MMP 1 and MMP 3 are reduced , without a concomitant reduction in their inducible inhibitor , TIMP-1 .
Hence , drugs that block NF-kB in the diseased synovial tissue should inhibit both synovitis and joint Immunology : Bondeson et al destruction .
Although none are yet known to be both safe and effective , it is likely that some will be found because of intense screening efforts in the pharmaceutical industry .
Based on the above data and finding of nuclear NF-KB in active RA joints ( 52 , 53 ) , NF- « B activation seems to be central to the pathogenesis of RA and perhaps other chronic inflammatory dis-eases .
There is much excitement in the pharmaceutical industry about the power of `` genomics `` approaches to define candidate genes as potential therapeutic targets .
However , there is a dearth of techniques to rapidly assess which , if any , of the potential candidates are worth pursuing further .
By bridging genetic and functional approaches , adenovirus as used here provides a way of accelerating therapeutic development .
Because it is possible to generate a wide spectrum of inhibitors by molecular approaches , such as antisense cDNA , dominant negative kinases , or single chain Fv antibodies , this adenoviral approach has the power to ascertain what a specific and potent drug blocking a certain pathway would achieve at the actual disease site .
