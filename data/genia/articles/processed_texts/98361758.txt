RAPID COMMUNICATION Synergistic Activation of MAP Kinase ( ERK1/2 ) by Erythropoietin and Stem Cell Factor Is Essential for Expanded Erythropoiesis By Xingwei Sui , Sanford B. Krantz , Min You , and Zhizhuang Zhao Stem cell factor ( SCF ) and erythropoietin ( EPO ) work synergistically to support erythropoiesis , but the mechanism for this synergism is unknown .
By using purified human erythroid colony-forming cells ( ECFC ) , we have found that SCF and EPO synergistically activate MAP kinase ( MAPK , ERK1/ 2 ) , which correlates with the cell growth and thus may be responsible for the synergistic effects .
Treatment of the cells with PD98059 and wortmannin , inhibitors of MEK and PI-3 kinase , respectively , inhibited the synergistic activation of MAPK and also the cell growth , further supporting this conclusion .
Wortmannin only inhibits MAPK activation in RYTHROPOIESIS IS REGULATED by a number of growth factors and cytokines , among which stem cell factor ( SCF ) and erythropoietin ( EPO ) play an essential role both in vivo and in vitro . '
'' Mice with mutations in the SCF gene , Steel ( Sl ) , or its receptor gene c-kit ( W ) develop severe anemia characterized by depressed erythropoiesis* `` ; EPO and EPO-receptor ( EPO-R ) knockout mice die of failure of fetal liver erythrocyte generation . ``
In vitro , whereas EPO alone is able to produce human erythroid cell development and maturation from progenitor cells , a markedly enhanced , synergistic proliferation and expansion of developing erythroid cells is supported by the combination of EPO and SCF .
!
4-0 Although the synergistic effects of EPO and SCF on the production of erythroid cells have been well documented , the intracellular mechanism by which SCF and EPO coordinate the synergistic effect is poorly understood .
In a recent study , Wu et al `` reported that , in HCD57 cells , SCF rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of EPO-R and c-Kit physically associates with the cytoplasmic domain of EPO-R .
They proposed that c-Kit activates EPO-R by tyrosine phosphorylation to induce further proliferation and maturation of erythroid progenitor cells .
This could provide an explanation for the synergistic effect of EPO and SCF on erythropoiesis .
However , HCD57 is an immortal cell line that does not exhibit synergistic cell growth upon combined treatment with SCF and EPO .

We demonstrate that , although SCF can induce phosphorylation of EPO-R , it is not sufficient to transduce signals via EPO-R and support cell growth .
Instead , our data show that SCF and EPO synergistically activate MAP kinase ( MAPK , ERK1/2 ) , which correlates with the cell growth and thus may be responsible for the synergistic effects .

SYNERGISTIC ACTIVATION OF MAPK BY EPO AND SCF minutes to remove platelets .
This step was repeated once and then the cells were incubated with one-half volume of neuraminidase-treated and one-half volume of IgG-coated sheep red blood cells ( RBCs ) .
After centrifugation at 130g at 24°C for 10 minutes , the cells were placed in ice for 60 minutes and then separated over F-H at 400g at 24°C for 10 minutes to remove the rosetted lymphocytes .
The interface cells were then incubated overnight at 37°C in Iscove 's modified Dulbecco 's medium ( IMDM ) containing 20 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 1 % BSA , and 4 % giant cell tumor ( GCT ) -conditioned medium to remove adherent cells .
The nonadherent cells were collected the next day ( day 1 ) and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies to CD11b , CD2 , CD4SR , and CD16 for 60 minutes at 4°C on a gently rocking platform .
The cells were then washed three times with IMDM containing 2 % FCS and resuspended in IMDM containing 5 % FCS .
Five-milliliter aliquots were incubated at 4°C for 90 minutes in 100-mm plastic tissue culture dishes ( 100 X 200 ) coated with affinity-purified goat antimurine IgG to remove the antibody-positive cells . ``
The antibody-negative nonadherent cells were then collected , washed , and are refered to as day-1 cells .
The collected day-1 cells were cultured in a suspension mixture containing 30 % FCS , 1 % deionized BSA , 2 U/mL of thEPO , 100 ng/mL of thSCF , 50 U/mL of rhIL-3 , 10 ug/ml of insulin , 10~* mol/L of 2-mercaptoethanol , 500 U/mL of penicillin , and 40 ug/ml of streptomycin in IMDM at 37°C in a high humidity 5 % CO ; , 95 % air incubator .
At day 6 of the suspension culture , equal volumes of fresh IMDM containing 20 % FCS and 1 % BSA and additional doses of SCF and EPO were added to the culture .
The cultured cells were collected at day 8 of suspension culture , and these cells are referred to as day-8 ECFC .
Compared with the day-6 ECFC used in our previous study , `` `` the yield and purity of day-8 ECFC were significantly increased with this modified method ( yield : 3 to 5 times more than that at day 6 ; purity : 80 % + 4.6 % v 63 % + 7.9 % ) .
The purity of the ECFC refers to the percentage of cells that can form erythroid colonies in the plasma assay . ``
The cells that can not form colonies are mainly proerythroblasts and erythroblasts , as shown by cytospin mophological studies .
The day-8 ECFC were washed twice with PBS and used for all further studies .
Cell starvation and stimulation .
- After washing with PBS , day-8 ECFC were resuspended at a cell density of 2 to 5 X 105/mL in IMDM containing 0.1 % BSA and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour .
The cells were then washed once again with PBS and reincubated at 37°C for an additional 2 hours .
After the serum-deprived starvation , the cells were exposed to EPO and SCF at their optimal concentrations for various periods of time .
Optimal concentrations of SCF at 100 ng/mL and EPO at 40 U/mL were obtained from dose-response experiments .
Activation of MAPK induced by SCF and EPO in human ECFC reached plateaus at these concentrations , respectively .
These are concentrations at which the receptors ( EPO , c-Kit ) on the ECFC cell surface are completely saturated . '
> `` `` For studies involving kinase inhibitors ( PD98059 and Wortmanin } , the ECFC were preincubated with the inhibitors at varying concentrations for 1 hour before stimulation or further cell culture .
The stimulation was stopped by adding 10 vol of cold PBS and the cells were washed and lysed in buffer A for whole cell extraction .
For preparation of nuclear extracts , the pelleted cells were resuspended in three packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer B , swollen for 10 minutes , and lysed by repeated passage through a 25-gauge needle .
Nuclei were collected and washed by centrifugation at 16,0005 for 10 minutes and then extracted in buffer A supplemented with 0.42 mol/L NaCl and 20 % glycerol on ice for 30 minutes .
The supernatants ( referred to as the nuclear extracts ) were cleared by centrifugation at 16,0005 for 1 minute and used for STAT activity analyses .
Gel mobility shift assays of STATs .
The activities of STATs were determined by analyzing the ability of the protein to form complexes with specific DNA probes in gel shift assays .
The DNA probes used were PIE-derived from a prolactin-inducible element and hSIE , a high-affinity sequence for the sis-inducible element of the fos promotor .
PIE is specifically for detection of STATS , whereas hSIE contains 1143 high affinity binding sites for STAT1 and STAT3 .
PIE and SIE were made by annealing 5'-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAA-3 ' with 5'-GGATTGAATTCCTAGAAA-3 ' and 5-GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATC-3 ' with 5'-TCGACGATTTACGGGAAATG3 ' , respectively .
'* These double-stranded DNA probes with staggered ends were labeled by Klenow fragment in the presence of [ y- > P ] dCTP and [ y- > P ] dTTP for PIE and [ y- > 2P ] dCTP alone for SIE at room temperature for 30 minutes .
Free nucleotides were removed by using a nucleotide removing kit from Qiagen ( Chatsworth , CA ) .
Nuclear extracts containing 10 ug protein were preincubated with 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) .poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) for 10 minutes , which was followed by the addition of 2 mL 3°P-labeled DNA probes and further incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 minutes .
The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5 % polyacrylamide gels ( acrylamide : bisacrylamide = 39:1 ) containing 2.5 % glycerol made in 0.5 % TBE buffer .
Gels were dried and exposed on x-ray film .
MAPK activity assay .
The whole cell extracts made in buffer A were immunoprecipitated with phospho-specific MAPK antibody , and the MAPK activity in the immunoprecipitates was assayed with myelin basic protein ( MBP ) as a substrate in the presence of [ y- > °P ] -ATP , as described previously .
Suspension and colony assays .
- Suspension and plasma-clot assays of ECFC were performed as we previously reported . '
> `` `` Cell numbers in the serum-containing suspension culture were determined every other day .
To examine the effects of kinase inhibitor on cell growth , the ECFC were cultured in the presence of varying concentration of inhibitors .
Because both PD98059 and Wortmannin were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) and DMSO might have toxic effects on the cells , the final concentration of DMSO in all culture was limited to less than 0.2 % , which has been shown to have no effects on ECFC growth in our studies .
Plasma clot culture was maintained for 7 days and the colonies formed were fixed and stained with 3,3 ' dimethoxybenzidine and hematoxylin for enumeration of erythroid colonies .
Sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -gels and Western blotting .
Protein extracts were separated by 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophore-sis ( SDS-PAGE ) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Amersham ) .
The membranes were probed with various primary antibodies that were detected by using the enhanced chemilumi-nescence ( ECL ) system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies ( Amersham ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
RESULTS SCF induces transient phosphorylation of EPO-R , but can not replace EPO to support erythropoiesis in vitro .
- Over the past years , we have established a method to purify large amounts of human ECFC from human peripheral blood . ``
'' Our previous studies have shown that these cells at day 6 to 8 express about 1,000 EPO-R and 23,000 c-Kit receptors per cell and are highly sensitive to treatment with SCF and EPO .
A majority of these cells are able to form RBC colonies in semisolid cultures .
!
36 ! ``
These highly purified ECFC thus provide a good primary cell system to study cell signaling .
To explore the mechanisms for the synergism of SCF and EPO , we first examined tyrosine phosphorylation of EPO-R and c-Kit after stimulation by their ligands .
As shown in Fig 1A and B , both SCF and EPO stimulated rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of their own receptors , respectively .
Stimulation of cells with SCF alone also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EPO-R , although the degree of phosphorylation was less than that observed with EPO and disappeared after 10 minutes .
However , in the presence of EPO , SCF appeared to show no enhancing effect on EPO-R phosphorylation ( Fig 1B ) .
Whereas SCF alone possessed some effect on EPOR phosphorylation , EPO alone had From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Phosphorylation of EPO-R upon treatment of the cells with SCF confirms the results reported by others . ``
'' However , no physical association between these two receptors was observed , because Western blotting of EPO-R immunoprecipitates with c-Kit antibody or c-Kit immunoprecipitates with EPO-R antibody did not show any coimmunoprecipitation of one receptor with the other ( data not shown ) .
We next determined whether SCF could stimulate erythroid cell growth while inducing EPO-R phosphorylation .
Figure 1C shows the growth of erythroid cells in suspension culture .
Compared with the synergistically stimulated cell growth induced by the combination of EPO and SCF , EPO alone manifested only 20 % to 25 % of this erythroid cell production from ECFC over a period of 7 days , whereas SCF alone did not support cell growth at all .
Similar results were observed in the erythroid colony-forming assays with semisolid culture medium .
In this case , the addition of SCF to EPO significantly increased both the number and the size of RBC colonies .

Cell extracts were subject to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Kit and anti-EPO-R antibodies in the presence of protein A-Sepharose beads .
Immunoprecipitates ( corresponding to whole cell extracts containing 50 pg of total protein ) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antiphos-photyrosine antibody 4G-10 .
( C ) To determine the requirement of SCF and EPO for growth of ECFC , day-6 ECFC ( 5 x 10° ) were incubated in 20 % FBS , 1 % BSA-containing medium supplemented with SCF , EPO , or SCF + EPO .

Data represent the mean values from three independent experiments .
ylation of EPO-R on tyrosine , it can not replace EPO to support erythroid cell growth .
Thus , SCF-induced EPO-R phosphorylation may not be sufficient to activate EPO-R and transduce signals through it .
The synergistic effects of SCF and EPO on erythropoiesis are most likely mediated by intracellular signaling events downstream of the receptors .
SCF and EPO synergistically activate MAPK in human erythroid progenitor cells .
- MAP kinase ( MAPK , ERK1/2 ) is a major transducer of extracellular mitogenic signals that promote cell proliferation and differentiation , `` ?
and we thought that it might be involved in the synergistic effects of EPO and SCF on erythropoiesis .
Because phosphorylation of MAPK is absolutely required for its activation , we used a phospho-specific MAPK antibody that only recognizes the phosphorylated form of the enzyme to determine its activation .
Figure 2A illustrates the time course of the activation .
When serum-starved ECFCs were treated with EPO or SCF alone , marginal MAPK phosphorylation was observed .
The phosphorylation induced by SCF or EPO appeared after 5 minutes , reached a peak at 10 minutes , and then declined slowly thereafter .

Synergistic effects of SCF and EPO on phosphorylation of MAPK ( ERK1 and ERK2 ) ( A ) and MEK ( B ) and on stimulation of MAPK activity ( C ) .
Serum-starved ECFC were treated with SCF , EPO , or SCF + EPO for the indicated periods of time .
Whole cell extracts ( 20 ug protein ) were subject to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses with anti-phospho-M APK ( A ) or anti-phospho-MEK ( B ) antibodies .
( C ) For determination of MAPK activity , cells were stimulated for 10 minutes with SCF , EPO , or SCF + EPO and whole cell extracts containing about 60 ug of total protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phospho-M APK .
The MAPK activities in the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by using myelin basic protein as a substrate in the presence of [ y-*°P ] -ATP in buffer A containing PKI peptide and calmidi-zolium , inhibitors of PKA and PKC , respectively .

combination of SCF and EPO gave rise to markedly enhanced MAPK phosphorylation .
The phosphorylation appeared within 5 minutes , reached a maximum at 10 minutes , and then decreased gradually with detectable phosphorylation remaining at 60 minutes .
Densitometric analyses indicated that the level of MAPK phosphorylation induced by the combination of SCF and EPO was at least 10-fold higher than the combined value obtained when cells were treated with SCF and EPO separately .
In all cases , Western blot analyses with antibodies to regular anti-MAPK antibody showed that the protein levels of MAPK in the cells were not altered by the treatment ( data not shown ) .
These data demonstrate a synergistic activation of MAPK by SCF and EPO .

Cell numbers were determined after 7 days in culture .
PD98059 activity was assayed in liquid-solid reaction .
Consistent with the results obtained with MAPK phosphorylation , the combined treatment of ECFCs with SCF and EPO gave rise to a markedly enhanced MAPK activity , fourfold to sixfold greater than that observed when cells were treated with SCF or EPO alone ( Fig 2C ) .
The degree of synergy is less than that observed with anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies , but this could be due to a lesser efficiency of the liquid-solid phase reaction for activity assays .
Collectively , the data indicate that SCF and EPO synergistically stimulate MAPK activation by inducing signifi-cant , greater-than-additive increases in both MAPK phosphorylation and kinase activity .
Because the synergistic activation of MAPK correlates with the synergistic effect on cell growth , we conclude that the synergistic effect of SCF and EPO on erythropoiesis is mediated by the synergistic activation of MAPK .
PD98059 ( MEK1/2 inhibitor ) and Wortmannin ( PI-3 kinase inhibitor ) affect MAPK activation and cell growth induced by SCF and EPO .
To prove further the importance of MAPK activation in erythropoiesis , we examined the effect of PD98059 , which acts as a highly selected inhibitor of MEK , on MAPK activation and cell growth induced by SCF and EPO .
Pretreatment of cells with 100 umol/L PD98059 completely inhibited activation of MAPK induced by EPO and SCF ( Fig 3A ) .
Concomitantly , PD98059 treatment also dose-dependently inhibited growth of ECFC in suspension culture .
The inhibitory effect was observed at a concentration of 50 umol/L , and at 200 umol/L , greater than 70 % inhibition was observed ( Fig 3B ) .
In Wortmannin Results represent data from three independent experiments .
an attempt to show the mechanism controlling MAPK activation by SCF and EPO , we also treated the cells with wortmannin , a PI-3 kinase inhibitor .
Wortmannin markedly inhibited the activation of MAPK induced by EPO but had no inhibitory effect on that induced by SCF alone ( Fig 3A ) .
Furthermore , it reduced the synergistic activation of MAPK phosphorylation by SCF and EPO to a level similar to that attained with SCF alone ( lanes 2 , 10 , and 12 , Fig 3A ) .
It should be noted that a nonspecific band right below phospho-Erk2 was equally distributed in all lanes .
Accordingly , wortmannin also markedly inhibited EPO , but not SCF-induced MEK activation ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that PI-3 kinase is involved in the EPO- but not in SCF-mediated MAPK activation and that SCF and EPO may activate MAPK through different pathways .
The insensitivity of SCF-induced MAPK activation to wortmannin also suggests that SCF does not transduce EPO-R-mediated MAPK activation , although it causes tyrosine phosphorylation of EPO-R. As expected , pretreatment of ECFC with wortmannin also inhibited the growth of ECFC in liquid medium cultures , although the degree of inhibition was slightly lower compared with that exhibited by PD98059 ( Fig 3C ) .
While Fig 3 demonstrated the inhibition of ECFC growth in suspension culture , similar results were also obtained with erythroid colony formation assays in semisolid medium .
Together , these data indicate that the synergistic activation of MAPK by SCF and EPO plays an essential role in the proliferation and maturation of human erythroid progenitors .

The presence of STATS in the DNA-protein complex is evident in the super-shift analyses 1147 with anti-STATS5 antibody ( Fig 4A , lane 12 ) .
EPO-induced STATS activation was detected after 5 minutes of incubation and remained at 30 minutes .
SCF alone failed to stimulate any STATS activity and addition of SCF to EPO had no significant effect on EPO-induced STATS activation .
This again suggests that , although SCF causes tyrosine phosphorylation of EPO-R , it can not transduce a signal through the receptor .
PD98059 and wortmannin , which displayed marked effects on cell growth and MAPK activation , did not affect the EPO-induced STATS activation , suggesting that MAPK and PI-3 kinase may not be involved in the EPO-dependent STATS activation .
These experiments indicate that activation of STATS5 does not appear to be involved in the synergistic effect of SCF and EPO .
The fact that both STAT5a and STAT5b knock-outs did not show any abnormalities of erythropoiesis suggests that STAT5 may not be important for erythropoiesis in vivo . ``
'' `` `` However , because of the possible redundancy between STAT 5a and STAT 5b , double knock-out mice of STAT 5a and STAT 5b need to be generated to test the role of STATS in erythropoiesis .
DISCUSSION In the present study , we demonstrated that SCF and EPO synergistically activate MAPK , which correlates with their effects on erythroid cell growth , thus providing an intracellular mechanism for the synergistic action of SCF and EPO in erythropoiesis .
Our data also suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of EPO-R produced by SCF is not sufficient to transduce the EPO signal , which is evident in the failure of SCF to induce wortmannin-sensitive MAPK activation and activation of STAT5 .
SCF may cause phosphorylation of EPO-R at sites that are not essential for signal transduction .
MAPK lies at a convergent point for many signaling events .
It plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation and differentiation `` ?
and preventing apoptosis . ``
The inhibition of erythroid cell growth and colony formation by inhibitors of MEK and PI-3 kinase demonstrate the crucial role of MAPK in the SCF- and EPO-mediated erythropoiesis .
Both the magnitude and duration of the activation are crucial , and studies suggest that transient activation of MAPK may trigger prolifera-tion , whereas sustained activation allows differentiation . ``
The synergistic effects of SCF and EPO observed in our current study not only greatly enhanced the magnitude , but also enhanced the duration of the activation , which may be important for both proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells .
Prolonged activation of MAPK might also play a role in preventing apoptosis , as reported in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells . ``
Prevention of apoptosis is believed to be the primary role for EPO . ``
Although synergistic activation of MAPK has been previously observed in various cell lines when treated with insulin and phorbol ester , `` integrins and growth factors , `` granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and SCF , `` or interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) and SCF , `` the degree of the synergistic effects was not as significant as we observed with SCF and EPO in the primary erythroid progenitor cells .
Moreover , in this study , we were able to correlate directly the synergy in signal transduction with the synergy in cell growth .
Considering that hematopoiesis requires the presence of multiple growth factors or cytokines , this study begins to show how these growth factors and cytokines interact to From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

1148 produce balanced growth and differentiation .
It also suggests that the synergistic effects of other growth factors and cytokines in other tissue systems may be mediated through synergistic activation of MAPK .
The general scheme of the MAPK activation pathway includes a series of protein phosphorylations and protein-protein interactions involving , sequentially , Grb2 , mSOS , Ras , Raf-1 , MEK , and MAPK .
SCF transduces its signal by binding to its receptor c-Kit , a PDGF family receptor tyrosine kinase , and , thus , presumably , it activates MAPK via the Ras/Raf pathway . ``
However , for EPO , direct recruitment of Grb2 to EPO-R has not been reported .
Although phosphorylation of SHC and insulin receptor substrate-2 after EPO stimulation might provide docking sites for Grb2 binding,4~* recent studies suggests the existence of a SHC/Grb2-independent path-way .
** `` `` The fact that the PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibited EPO-induced MAPK activation , but not that of SCE , suggested that SCF and EPO may lead to activation of MAPK through different pathways .
Because SCF and EPO synergistically activate MEK , the convergent point at which these two pathways interact should be at the level of MEK or above MEK .
Presumably , these two pathways would transduce signals that act on different sites of the target protein to facilitate the synergistic effects .
How EPO transduces its signal through PI-3 kinase to MAPK is still unknown .
It has been postulated that protein kinase C might be one of the mediators . ``
