12 2831-2836 Human T cell transcription factor GATA-3 stimulates HIV-1 expression Zhuoying Yang and James Douglas Engel !
* Department of Biochemistry , Molecular Biology and Cell Biology , Northwestern University , Evanston , IL 60208-3500 , USA Received March 30 , 1993 ; Revised and Accepted May 6 , 1993 ABSTRACT A family of transcriptional activating proteins , the GATA factors , has been shown to bind to a consensus motif through a highly conserved C , zinc finger DNA binding domain .
One member of this multigene family , GATA-3 , is most abundantly expressed in T lymphocytes , a cellular target for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and replication .
In vitro DNase I footprinting analysis revealed six hGATA-3 binding sites in the U3 region ( the transcriptional regulatory domain ) of the HIV-1 LTR .
Cotransfection of an hGATA-3 expression plasmid with a reporter plasmid whose transcription is directed by the HIV-1 LTR resulted in 6- to 10-fold stimulation of LTR-mediated transcription , whereas site specific mutation of these GATA sites resulted in virtual abrogation of the activation by hGATA-3 .
Further , deletion of the hGATA-3 transcriptional activation domain abolished GATA-dependent HIV-1 trans-activation , showing that the stimulation of viral transcription observed is a direct effect of cotransfected hGATA-3 .
Introduction of the HIV-1 plasmids in which the GATA sites have been mutated into human T lymphocytes also caused a significant reduction in LTR-mediated transcription at both the basal level and in ( PHA- plus PMA- ) stimulated T cells .
These observations suggest that in addition to its normal role in T lymphocyte gene regulation , hGATA-3 may also play a significant role in HIV-1 transcriptional activation .
INTRODUCTION Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is the etiologic agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , and infects human CD4* T cells and myelomonocytic cells using the CD4 receptor for viral entry ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
The retroviral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV-1 has been suggested to play a number of roles in the regulation of the life cycle of the virus after infection ( 4 ) .
The viral LTR U3 region contains a variety of cis-acting regulatory sequences responsible for modulating viral gene expression and was initially divided into the basal promoter region , the enhancer ( Enh ) , the negative regulatory element ( NRE ) and the downstream regulatory element ( 4 ) .
Beginning at the transcription initiation site of the HIV-1 LTR , the leader binding protein ( LBP-1 ) has been shown to interact with three sites between -17 and +27 , and negatively regulates the expression of HIV-1 ( 5 ) ; the virally-encoded regulatory factor tat also binds to this same region in both DNA and RNA ( 6 , 7 , 8 ) .
The minimal promoter contains TATA ( 9 ) and Spl ( 10 , 11 ) factor binding sites responsible for basal level transcription of the virus .
The enhancer element contains two binding sites for NF-xB ( 12 ) , a ubiquitous transcription factor which becomes post-translationally induced upon T cell activation , and is the principal cis-determinant for the inducibility of HIV-1 transcription by T cell stimuli .
Lying further 5 ' from the HIV-1 CAP site is the NRE region , which suppresses transcription of HIV-1 by two- to three-fold ( 4 ) .
The NRE region contains recognition sequences for a variety of cellular transcription factors , including three AP-1 factor binding sites ( 13 ) , a consensus myb binding site ( 14 ) , a T cell-specific NFAT-1 binding site ( 15 ) , and another element ( at - 165 to -175 ) which closely resembles the negatively regulatory element of the IL-2 gene ( 16 ) .
While the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 has been extensively examined , the precise role that many of these factors may play in the basal or induced levels of transcriptional stimulation from HIV-1 remains obscure , primarily due to a lack of direct evidence for the proposed activity of these factors in several of the aforementioned cases .
Moreover , the only cell type-specific transcription factor known to bind to this LTR ( NFAT-1 ) has been shown not to participate in activation of the virus ( 45 ) .
We nonetheless anticipated that hematopoietic cell-restricted transcription factors might play an important role in HIV-1 gene regulation .
The T lymphocyte lineage-restricted transcription factor , human GATA-3 ( hGATA-3 ) , is a member of a multigene family which binds to a consensus GATA DNA sequence motif through a highly conserved C , zinc finger DNA binding domain ( 17 , 18 ) .
GATA-3 is predominantly expressed in T lymphocytes , where no other GATA proteins are detectable ( 19 ) , as well as in a specific subset of neurons within the vertebrate CNS and * To whom correspondence should be addressed 2832 Nucleic Acids Research , 1993 , Vol .

12 in erythroid cells ( 18 , 19 , 20 ) , and is highly conserved in amino acid sequence identity when comparing the vertebrate GATA-3 proteins ( 18 , 21 ) .
GATA-3 binding sites have been identified in the regulatory regions of the T cell receptors ( TCRs ; 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 ) , and it has been shown that the GATA-3 sites within the human TCR 8 gene enhancer are required for the tissue-specific activation of this gene ( 18 , 27 ) .
On inspection of the transcriptional regulatory domain of the HIV-1 LTR , we found four consensus GATA binding sites ( WGATAR ; 28 ) , and therefore sought to determine whether or not hGATA-3 might be involved in regulating transcription of the virus .
hGATA-3 was found to bind to the four anticipated GATA sites , but in addition , strongly bound in vitro to two other non-consensus sites .
Mutation of all sites resulted in much lower activation of the virus upon transfection into T lymphocytes .
These effects were shown to be specific for the hGATA-3 protein by introduction of mutations into the coding sequence of the hGATA-3 transcriptional activation domain ; while the mutant factor binds to DNA indistinguishably from the wild type hGATA-3 protein , it no longer stimulates HIV-1 LTR-directed transcription .
These data show that transcription factor hGATA-3 contributes to transcriptional activation by the HIV-1 LTR .
MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA binding assays 10 ug of RSV/hGATA-3 cDNA was transfected into QT6 quail fibroblast cells using CaPO , ( detailed below ) and cell lysates were prepared 48 hours after transfection ( 29 ) ; QT6 cells were used for expression of GATA proteins , since they lack discernible GATA binding activities ( 17 and Figure 2C ) .
The cell lysates were then partially purified for total DNA binding activity by passing through , and high salt elution from , a double stranded calf thymus DNA column and pooling the bound fractions ( 30 ) .
DNase I footprint assays were performed by incubating this partially purified hGATA-3 protein with either coding or non-coding strand end-labeled HIV-1 LTR DNA ( 30 ) .
For electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay ( EGMSA ) , whole-cell extracts prepared as above were incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide T & SE4 ( 18 ) , which corresponds to the GATA sequences within human T cell receptor 6 gene enhancer footprint 4 ( 24 ) .
Gel shift assays were performed as described previously ( 18 ) .
PCR mutagenesis The primers used in these PCR assays ( each of which contain additional nucleotides outside of the restriction site for convenience of subsequent restriction enzyme digestion ) are shown in Table 1 .
The mutation of each GATA binding site ( determined in the footprinting assays , above ) in the HIV-1 LTR was independently generated by PCR mutagenesis into the corresponding restriction enzyme site shown in Fig .
2B .
DNA sequences 5 ' and 3 ' to the target GATA site were amplified separately , digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme , and ligated into pCAT-basic vector ( Promega ) .
Further mutations were introduced by repeating the procedure until all of the individual GATA site mutations were incorporated into the noGATA/CAT plasmid .
Since sequences 5 to GATA binding site 5 ( Figure 1A ) were found to not influence the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR ( 4 , 31 ) , both HIV and the noGATA/CAT test plasmids extend to nucleotide -376 relative to the mRNA CAP site .
A mutation which specifically abolishes all trans-activation activity within the hGATA-3 protein coding sequence was generated by removing an internal Smal fragment ( 31 ) .
The mutant hGATA-3 plasmid ( called d29-128 ) specifically deletes , in frame , amino acids 29 to 128 of the hGATA-3 protein ( 18 ) , and was confirmed by DNA sequencing .
The mutant d29-128 protein binds to DNA in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type hGATA-3 .
Transfections HeLa cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure ( 32 ) with 10 ug of the wild type or mutated HIV-1 LTR constructs plus 5 ug of RSV/AGATA-3 ( 18 ) .
40 % of the cells from a confluent plate were used for each transfection .
Cell lysates were prepared 48 hours after transfection by the freeze/thaw procedure ( 33 ) .
Protein concentrations were determined and CAT assays were performed using aliquots of extract containing equal quantities of recovered protein ( 34 ) .
The result was quantified by determining the amount of acetylated [ !
4C ] chloramphenicol produced in the enzymatic assay and the degree of conversion was quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager .
Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal bovine serum .
10 `` cells were transfected with 5 ug of HIV-1 LTR constructs using DEAE-dextran ( 35 ) .
100 ng of RSV/luciferase was also added as a transfection efficiency control .
Half of the cells from each transfection were grown in the presence of 10 nM phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ; Sigma ) plus 2 ug/ml phytoheamagglutinnin ( PHA ; Sigma ) for the last 20 hours in order to activate the T lymphocytes .
Cell lysates were prepared 44 hours after transfection and luciferase expression was quantitated with a luminometer .
CAT assays were normalized using an amount of extract containing equal luciferase activity .
All cell transfection or cotransfection experiments reported here were performed on at least three separate occasions , often using different plasmid preparations .
Error bars represent one s.d .
from these accumulated assays .
RESULTS hGATA-3 binds in vitro to six sites within the HIV-1 LTR Since the expression profile of hGATA-3 is partially consistent with the documented tropism of HIV-1 replication , one might anticipate that hGATA-3 could play a role in the T lymphocyte expression of HIV-1 .
Initial inspection of the sequences in the viral LTR indicated the presence of four potential GATA factor binding sites ( Figure 1A ) .
Both strands of HIV-1 U3 region DNA were examined for their ability to bind to hGATA-3 by DNase I footprinting analysis using partially purified hGATA-3 protein expressed in , and partially purified from , animal cells ( Materials and Methods ; as also shown in Figure 2C , no GATA binding activity is normally detected in QT6 cells ) .
The results actually revealed six hGATA-3 interaction sites ( Figure 2A ) , all localized within the 5 domain of the LTR .
The four consensus GATA sites ( 28 ) were protected by hGATA-3 , as were two non-canonical binding sites : GATTA ( site 5 ) and GATGA ( site 2 ; Figure 1A ) .
The latter site overlaps a previously defined binding site for a 50 kD negative regulatory protein of the IL-2 gene ( 16 ) .
The specificity for binding of hGATA-3 to these sites was confirmed in competition experiments .
When a 50-fold molar excess of the high affinity GATA oligonucleotide TSE4 ( from the human TCR 8 gene enhancer ; 18 , 27 ) is included in the Table 1 .

footprinting reactions , the protein : DNA complex at each of the six sites is disrupted ( Figure 2A ) .
These data show that hGATA-3 binds to six specific sites within the HIV-1 LTR transcriptional regulatory domain .
hGATA-3 trans-activates HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcription We investigated the possibility that hGATA-3 might trans-activate HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcription by cotransfection experiments using a reporter gene whose activity was transcriptionally directed by the HIV-1 LTR .
We initially examined the activity of this plasmid ( and derivatives ) after transfection into HeLa cells , where only low levels of hGATA-2 , and no hGATA-1 or hGATA-3 , is expressed .
The HIV-1 LTR ( nucleotides -376 to +80 , Figure 1A ) was subcloned into a promoterless reporter vector to generate HIV this construct was cotransfected into HeLa cells with an activator plasmid constitutively expressing the hGATA-3 protein ( RSV/hGATA-3 ; 18 ) .
As shown in Figure 3A , hGATA-3 indeed stimulates HIVWwt/CAT expression by an average of seven-fold upon cotransfection into HeLa cells .
Identical results were also obtained repeating the same experiments in QT6 cells , thereby demonstrating that the stimulatory effect detected in non-T cells is dependent only upon cotransfected hGATA-3 activator plasmid ( 31 ) .
These data show that the addition of hGATA-3 is capable of stimulating HIV-1 transcription in vertebrate cells which express little endogenous GATA factor .
To verify that the increase in expression of HIVWt/CAT was a direct effect of coexpressing functional hGATA-3 protein in the same cells , a deletion of amino acids 29 to 128 ( which abrogates the trans-activation ability of the factor ; 36 ) was introduced into the coding sequence of hGATA-3 .
As shown in Fig .
3A , the mutant hGATA-3 protein no longer trans-activates HIV transcription , although the mutant protein binds to a GATA oligonucleotide in EGMSA ( Fig .
2C ) and stably accumulates in transfected cells ( as confirmed by western blot analysis using an anti-hGATA-3 monoclonal antibody ; 36 ) .
These data show that a fully functional hGATA-3 factor is required for trans-activation of HIV-1-directed expression in vivo .
To test whether the increase in expression was a direct effect of hGATA-3 binding to the identified GATA sites within the LTR of HIV-1 ( Figure 2 ) , a series of mutations were generated in the LTR where the GATA sequences ( arbitrarily numbered 1 to 6 ; Figure 1 ) were individually changed into unique restriction enzyme recognition sites and then ligated into a single HIV-1 6 ~453 TGG AAGGGCTAAT TCACTCCCAA CGAAGACAAÂ® AÂ®AÂ®CcrTca Â§ -410 - TCTGTGGATC TACCACACAC AAGGCTACTT CAGAACTACA CACCAGGGCC ACGGGTCAGA AP-1 a coach 3 ~340 - PARCCACTGA _CCTTTGGATG GTGCTACAAG CTAGTACCAG TPGAGCCAGA GAGGCCAATA AP-A AP-1 ~270 AMGGAGAGAA CACCMGCTTG TTACACCCTG TGAGCCTGCA TGGGATGGAT GACCCGGAGA GAGAAGTGTT FAT a -200 - AGRGTGGAGG TTTGACAGCC GCCTAGCATE ccocomsase TecaTccosa GTacTTcaas TL-2 NRB i ~130 | AACTGCT @ AÂ® ATCGAGCTTG CTACAAGGGA CTTTCcGCTe GoGacrrce AcGGacocaÂ® we-xs wr-ks Spi Sp1 -60 .

The binding sites for hGATA-3 identified by in vitro footprinting ( Figure 2A ) are shown in outlined letters and are numbered 1 to 6 consecutively , beginning closest to the HIV-1 CAP site .

GATA binding sites and their mutations .

The individual and multiple GATA binding site mutations were next functionally analyzed for their effect upon the ability of hGATA-3 to direct transcription from the HIV-1 LTR .
Mutagenesis of individual GATA binding sites , including site 2 ( within the NRE ; 4 ) , resulted in only a slight diminution in the transcriptional stimulation of the LTR by hGATA-3 ( 31 ) .
However , when all of the mutations were combined into a single 2834 Nucleic Acids Research , 1993 , Vol .

Transcriptional stimulation of HIV-1 transcription is due to exogenous hGATA-3 protein .
QT6 cells were cotransfected with HIVwt/CAT and antisense or sense RSV/RGATA-3 DNA or mutant RSV/hGATA-3 429-128 ( Materials and methods ; 31 ) .
The cells were then split and plated on two separate dishes ; one set was used to assay HIV-1 LTR-directed transcription , while the other was used to prepare cellular extracts for EGMSA ( Materials and Methods ) .
The probe is a radiolabeled TdE4 oligonucleotide containing two GATA binding sites ( 18 ) .
The hGATA-3 shifted bands are indicated at the left by arrows .
Lane 1 is labeled oligonucleotide alone , while lanes 5 and 6 contain an additional 100 ng of unlabeled TdE4 oligonucleotide .
Extracts were prepared from QT6 cells transfected with RSV/hGATA-3 ( s ; lanes 2 , 5 ) , antisense RSV/hGATA-3 ( as ; lane 4 ) or RSV/hGATA-3 429-128 ( lanes 3 , 6 ) .
plasmid ( noGATA/CAT ; Figure 3C ) the ability of the LTR to be trans-activated by cotransfected hGATA-3 was significantly reduced .
Taken together , these data demonstrate that hGATA-3 stimulates transcription by binding to the GATA sites within the HIV-1 LTR U3 regulatory region .
hGATA-3 binding is required for maximal expression from the HIV-1 LTR in both quiescent and induced T lymphocytes We next examined the role of this T cell-restricted transcription factor in regulating HIV-1 expression in its natural environment , i.e .
within T lymphocytes .
The human T cell line Jurkat ( TCR Â« B+CD4+* ) , which expresses abundant hGATA-3 ( 18 ) , was transfected with the HIVwt/CAT and the noGATA/CAT ( Figure 3C ) reporter plasmids .
As do circulating T cells , Jurkat cells require two external stimuli to synthesize maximal amounts of lymphokine ( 37 ) , and induction of T lymphocytes has been shown to result in increased levels of hGATA-3 transcription ( 38 ) .
After transfection of the various HIV/CAT plasmids , the cells were incubated for a total of 44 hours , including treatment with PMA and PHA for the final 20 hours .
Transfection of either HIVWt/CAT or noGATA/CAT into Jurkat cells reveals a 10-fold induction of transcriptional activity when comparing stimulated to untreated T cells ( Figure 3B ) , even though the overall expression is significantly reduced in both resting or stimulated cells when noGATA/CAT is compared to HIVwt/CAT expression .
Thus hGATA-3 exerts its effect ( s ) in activating the basal transcriptional apparatus through binding to the GATA sites within the LTR in T cells in a stimulation-independent manner , rather than through the same PHA + PMA stimulatory pathway of activation which induces NF-xB ( 12 ) .
DISCUSSION We show here that the T lymphocyte transcription factor hGATA-3 binds in vitro with high specificity to six sites within the LTR of HIV-1 ( Figure 2 ) , and that the binding of hGATA-3 is required for a 7-fold increase in HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcriptional activation in non-lymphoid cells ( Figure 3A ) .
A mutated hGATA-3 factor , missing the transcriptional activation domain of the protein but which still binds to the GATA sites ( Figure 2C ) , fails to trans-activate HIV expression .
The reduction in HIV-1 transcription seen upon transfection of a mutated HIV-1 LTR ( bearing mutations in all of the GATA binding sites ) after transfection into T lymphocyte cells ( Figure 3B ) strongly supports the initial hypothesis that hGATA-3 is one of the cellular factors mediating viral LTR-directed transcription .
Mutation of all of the GATA binding sites did not fully abolish the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR in Jurkat cells .
The U3 transcriptional regulatory domain of HIV-1 harbors binding sites for a large number of different transcription factors , many of which have been shown to bind ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 16 ) , and several of which have been shown to exert direct transcriptional effects on this transcription unit ( 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 ) .
It could therefore be inferred that hGATA-3 acts in synergy with other cellular factors to stimulate HIV-1 transcription .
Deletion of the GATA binding sites , as well as other transcription factor binding sites , might cause a more severe defect in transcription than mutation of the binding of any of these individual sites .
A previous analysis of the element within the HIV-1 LTR bearing homology to the IL-2 NRE identified a relatively abundant T cell-restricted binding factor of 50 kD , and it has previously been shown that the molecular weight of hGATA-3 on SDS gels is approximately 50 kD ( 18 ) .
It is possible that the protein bound by this presumptive regulatory element may be due to overlap of those sequences with GATA site 2 of the LTR ( Fig .
1A ; 6 ) .
If the binding protein identified in that study is hGATA-3 , these results taken together suggest that hGATA-3 might function as a negative regulatory factor when placed in context with other regulatory proteins within the IL-2 NRE regulatory module , and thus hGATA-3 could have the property of being able to act as either a context-dependent positive ( 18 , 27 ) or negative ( 39 ) transcription factor .
However , we should be careful to point out that mutation of GATA sites 2 or 3 alone ( Fig .
1B ) display only slight alteration in phenotypic effect when these mutants are transfected into HeLa or Jurkat cells ( 31 ) , mutations which should have theoretically disrupted cooperative interactions with any other protein bound nearby ( e.g .
those interacting with a presumptive IL-2 NRE-associated protein or with c-myb , respectively ) .
It has previously been shown that the presence of one of the two NF-xB binding sites , one of the three Spl binding sites or the CAP-site proximal LBP-1 binding site is required for induction or repression , respectively , of HIV-1 transcription ( 5 , Nucleic Acids Research , 1993 , Vol .

hGATA-3 frans-activates HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription in HeLa cells .
Transfections were performed using either the HIVWt/CAT or noGATA/CAT plasmids with sense ( s ) hGATA-3 , hGATA 429-128 , or antisense ( as ) hGATA-3 plasmids as indicated to the left .
Cell lysates were prepared and the CAT assay results were quantified by determining the amount of acetylated [ ' C ] chloramphenicol produced in enzymatic assay ; the degree of conversion was quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager .
The results shown are calculated relative to the conversion by cotransfection with antisense hGATA-3 , and represent the average of four independent experiments .

CAT assays were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis , and the results shown are the average of three independent experiments using uninduced HIVWt/CAT transfection conversion percentage normalized as 1 .

HIV-1 LTR wild type and mutations .

The noGATA construct ( line 2 ) represents a plasmid in which each of the GATA binding sites was mutated by PCR ( black boxes ) into unique restriction enzymes sites ( Figure 1B ) .
Since deletion of GATA site 6 does not show a functional difference from the wild type HIV-1 LTR in transfection analysis ( 4,31 ) , the noGATA construct contains only the LTR sequences from -376 to +80 .
All of the mutation LTRs were then subcloned 5 ' to a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene ( pCATbasic ; Promega ) and all of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing .
10 , 12 ) .
Mutation of individual GATA binding sites resulted in only very small quantitative changes in HIV-1-LTR mediated transcription ; only by mutation of all of the GATA sites within the LTR do we see a significant reduction in the HIV-1 LTR-mediated gene expression , and that cumulative effect is smaller ( by 2- to 3-fold ) than the quite dramatic effect , for example , of mutation of the two NF-xB sites .
However , the data clearly demonstrate that the GATA binding sites are required for maximal expression of HIV-1 transcription .
Furthermore , the GATA site mutations decrease activity in both stimulated and unstimulated T cells , but do not affect the relative inducibility of viral transcription through the PHA + PMA stimulatory pathway .
Taken together , these results suggest that the interaction 2836 Nucleic Acids Research , 1993 , Vol .

12 of hGATA-3 with the basal transcriptional apparatus is cumulative and independent of phorbol ester or general mitogenic stimulation .
It has been shown that the binding of the CD4 receptor by the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 may be an early step in determining the cell type selectivity of the virus ( 40 , 41 ) .
After HIV enters a cell , a continuation in this selectivity of tissue-specific expression might logically be assumed to be governed by further cell type-restricted mechanisms , including the involvement of tissue-restricted transcriptional regulatory proteins .
The findings presented here that hGATA-3 is required for transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR in T cells provides direct evidence for a T lymphocyte-restricted transcription factor which modulates transcription of the virus in which the tropism of infection is partially consistent with the documented expression of a tissue-restricted transcription factor .
However , HIV replicates well in cell types which do not express GATA-3 .
Among the known members of this family , GATA-2 is expressed far more broadly than the other family members ( 17 ) , and GATA-2 and GATA-3 have been shown to bind to the same subset of consensus DNA sequences in vitro ( 46 ) .
HIV-1 might also be regulated by other GATA factors in specific myeloid ( 42 , 43 ) or neuronal ( 18 , 20 ) cell lineages , other cell types in which HIV-1 is known to exert cytopathic effects ( 1 ) and which also express other GATA factors ( 17 ) , is thus a subject of considerable interest , but awaits further detailed analysis .
