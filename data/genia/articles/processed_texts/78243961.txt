INTERACTION OF GLUCOCORTICOIDS WITH MACROPHAGES Identification of Glucocorticoid Receptors in Monocytes and Macrophages* By ZENA WERB , ROSEMARY FOLEY , anp ALLAN MUNCK ( From the Laboratory of Radiobiology , University of California , San Francisco , California 94143 , and the Departments of Medicine and Physiology , Dartmouth Medical School , Hanover , New Hampshire 03755 ) The mononuclear phagocyte system plays a central role in mediating host responses in inflammation ( 1 ) .
Glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory actions that may be of considerable importance in the therapeutic effects of these agents in chronic inflammation ; it is possible that some of these effects are mediated through direct hormonal action on macrophages .
Although the site of action of the glucocorticoids on macrophages has not been established , it has been shown that in many other glucocorticoid target systems the effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by specific macromolecular binding proteins , referred to as receptors ( 2-4 ) .
In this study we have established that monocytes and macrophages contain saturable glucocorticoid-binding proteins , with specificity of binding for cortisol , corticosterone , and related synthetic steroids such as dexamethasone , and that they have dissociation constants for binding within physiological ranges .

The cells were washed 3 times in Hanks ' balanced salt solution and resuspended at 2-4 x 10 % /ml in DME-LH .
The alveolar macrophages were then plated in multiwell dishes at 2 x 10° cells/ well , or cultured in suspension for 3 h before use in the assays of steroid binding .
Cells in suspension were centrifuged , washed in Hanks ' balanced salt solution , and resuspended at cytocrits of 0.24-0.36 for binding experiments .
Human monocytes were isolated from 300 ml of freshly drawn , citrated blood .
Mononuclear cells were concentrated by Ficoll-Hypaque fractionation ( 8 ) , washed twice in RPMI-1640 medium ( Grand Island Biological Co. ) , and resuspended at 1 x 10 `` cells/ml in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10 % autologous serum .
Cells were plated in multiwell plates precoated with 10 ug of fibrin/ em to aid adherence of monocytes .
Nonradioactive fibrin layers were prepared by the procedure used for `` I-labeled fibrin layers ( 9 ) .
After 16 h at 37°C in a CO ; incubator , nonadherent cells were removed by washing , and adherent cells were placed in serum-free DME-LH for 2 h before measurement of receptors .
The mean purity of the monocyte preparation was 93 % .
Cells were counted in a Coulter counter ( Coulter Electronics Inc. , Hialeah , Fla. ) , and differential cell counts were made on cytocentrifuge preparations stained with Wright 's stain .
Steroid Binding MEASUREMENT OF STEROID BOUND TO RECEPTORS IN INTACT CELLS .
- Monolayers of macrophages in 2-em*-diameter wells were washed rapidly 3 times at room temperature with =2 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 5.5 mM glucose ( KRPg ) .
Each well then received 100-200 ul of KRPg containing [ 1,2,4-°H ( N ) } dexamethasone or [ 6,7-°H ( N ) ] dexamethasone ( New England Nuclear , Boston , Mass .
; 30-50 Ci/mmol ) .
In a few experiments , [ 1,2,3- % H ( n ) ) triamcinolone acetonide ( New England Nuclear ; 45 Ci/mmol ) was used instead of [ *H ] ) dexamethasone .
The plates were incubated at 37°C for 70 min , then placed on ice .
Aliquots of medium from each well were taken to determine the concentration of free [ °H ) dexamethasone .
Each well was rinsed 6 times with 2 ml of ice-cold KRPg to remove free steroid , and then left for 20 min at room temperature with buffer .
The treatment at room temperature removed most of the nonsaturable fraction of cell-associated steroid , as previously shown for thymus cells ( 10 , 11 ) .
The remaining steroid was extracted with 150 ul of ethanol at room temperature for 20 min , followed by an additional 50 Ll to rinse the wells .
Samples were counted in Bray 's fluid ( New England Nuclear ) in a Packard Tri-Carb liquid scintillation spectrometer ( Packard Instrument Co. , Inc. , Downers Grove , Ill. ) .
Data were analyzed by conventional plots of bound versus free steroid , and by Scatchard plots separated by trial and error into saturable and nonsaturable components ( 12 , 13 ) .
Protein content of monolayers was determined in sham-treated wells which had not been extracted with ethanol , and on residual cellular protein after ethanol extraction by solubilization in 0.5 M NaOH followed by Lowry-Folin procedure with crystalline bovine serum albumin as standard ( 14 ) .
CompEtitivz sinping stuptEs .
Competition for binding with whole cells was carried out as for binding of [ *H ) dexamethasone alone , except that the incubation media contained both [ *H ) dexamethasone and the unlabeled competing steroid at the concentrations indicated in Results .
Cortisol and other steroids of similar solubility were dissolved in KRPg , and their concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring adsorption at 250 nm and assuming e = 1.4 x 10° M~ ' em~ ' ( 11 ) .
Less soluble steroids such as estradiol were dissolved in ethanol ; incubations for these steroids contained up to 1 % ethanol , which did not affect dexamethasone binding .
Steroids were obtained from Steraloids , Inc. , Pawling , N. Y. , Calbi-ochem , San Diego , Calif. , or Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , Mo .
DEXAMETHASONE BINDING TO `` CYTOPLASMIC `` AND NUCLEAR FORMS OF GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTORS AND TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE TRANSLOCATION FROM `` CYTOPLASMIC `` TO NUCLEAR FoRMs .
| Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were either washed out of the peritoneal cavity of mice and used directly , or cultured for 24 h in 100-mm-diameter tissue culture dishes as described above , and scraped off the surface with a rubber policeman before use .
The cells were sedimented and washed three times with KRPg at room temperature , and finally incubated at a cytocrit of 0.33 ml packed cells/ml of suspension with [ *H ) dexamethasone in the absence or presence of 500 nM unlabeled dexamethasone .
The values obtained in the presence of unlabeled dexamethasone were for nonsaturable binding .
The cells were incubated at 3°C for 120 min , then at 37°C for 30 min .
After both incubations , the cells in duplicate 20-ul aliquots of the suspensions were disrupted by 1686 MACROPHAGE GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTORS 800 O =J O ( dpm ) [ H ] Dexamethasone Bound p o 6 Time ( min ) Fic .

Time course of binding of dexamethasone to glucocorticoid receptors in thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages .
Binding to cells was with 2.8 nM [ °H ] dexamethasone .
Only saturable binding is shown .
The nonsaturable component determined in the presence of added cold dexamethasone ( 1,000 nM ) was < 20 % of the total binding .
Results are expressed as mean + SD , n = 3. hypotonic shock in 1.5 mM MgCl , to determine `` cytoplasmic `` and nuclear binding by a modification of the charcoal absorption and nuclear pellet procedures developed for lymphocytes ( 10 , 15 ) .
A modification consisting of a freeze-thaw ( freezing in acetone-dry ice , thawing at 3°C ) after addition of the cells to MgCl , was necessary to break open the macrophages .
Values were expressed as the mean + SD for saturable binding , obtained by subtracting the mean for nonsaturable binding at 4 nM [ *H ) dexamethasone .
Results Physicochemical Interactions of Dexamethasone with Thioglycollate-Elicited Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages .
Specific binding of [ *H ) dexamethasone to monolayers of thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages increased rapidly for 30 min at 37°C , and then reached a plateau ( Fig .
1 ) .
The rate of binding at 3°C was slower ( not shown ) .
Binding could be resolved into two components : a high affinity component , which was saturable and could be displaced by excess nonradioactive steroid , and a low affinity component , which was not saturated up to 100 nM dexamethasone and was not displaced by excess nonradioactive steroid ( Fig .
2 ) .
The high affinity binding had a half-maximum saturation ( K , ) at 3.7 nM dexamethasone .
High affinity binding was not influenced by the prolonged washing procedures used , whereas low affinity ( nonsaturable ) binding usually decreased to < 20 % of the total binding of radioactive hormone ; the 20-min room temperature wash was particularly useful in decreasing nonsaturable binding .
High affinity binding was = 80-100 fmol of dexamethasone/mg cell protein ( 3,500-6,000 binding sites/cell ) ( Table I ) .
Binding was enhanced by =20 % when the macrophages were removed from DME + FCS and placed in DME-LH at least 1 h before experiments for hormone binding .
High affinity binding did not increase further with culture of the cells in DME-LH for up to 72 h. The number and avidity of the hormone receptors did not change with time .
High affinity binding was the same when macrophages that had been explanted 1 , 24 , 72 , or 144 h were used .
Binding was proportional to the number of macrophages adhering to the plate .
Only viable cells bound the steroid ; macrophages killed by heat or acid did not bind dexamethasone .

[ °H ] Dexamethasone was present in the assay at 8 nM .
The binding of dexamethasone to the thioglycollate-elicited macrophages was specific for glucocorticoids .
As shown in Table II , dexamethasone , cortisol , and corticosterone competed for receptor-bound [ *H ] dexamethasone .
Progesterone and cortexolone also competed for receptors .
These substances sometimes act as antiglucocorticoids ( 4 ) .
Cortisone had a small but reproducible competing effect in macrophages , and it is possible that some limited metabolic conversion to cortisol may have occurred .
Estradiol , 11-epicortisol , testosterone , and dihydrotestosterone did not compete for binding .
In many other glucocorticoid-responsive systems , the hormone effect depends upon glucocorticoid binding to a receptor protein in the `` cytoplasm `` followed by intracellular transport into the nucleus ( 4 ) .
In a modified cytosol and nuclear-pellet preparation at 3°C , the receptor-bound dexamethasone in thioglycollate-elicited macrophages was largely found in a soluble `` cytoplasmic `` form , which was rapidly transferred to a nuclear form when the temperature was raised to 37°C ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , these results support the presence of a functional receptor system for dexamethasone in elicited mouse macrophages .
Glucocorticoid - Receptors in - Resident - Mouse Peritoneal - Macrophages .
Macrophages normally residing in the peritoneal cavity of mice also bound glucocorticoids with high affinity ( for triamcinolone acetonide , K , = 2.1 nM ) and contained =6,000 sites/cell ( Table I ) .
As in elicited peritoneal macrophages , steroids with glucocorticoid activity ( triamcinolone acetonide and dexamethasone ) and progesterone competed with dexamethasone for binding to receptors ( Table IID ) .

- High affinity saturable binding of glucocorticoids to macrophages elicited in the peritoneal cavity by pristane ( data not shown ) , resident lung macrophages ( data not shown ) , and P388D1 cells from a macrophage-like continuous line `` ( Table I ) was also demonstrated .
Rabbit Alveolar Macrophages .
Pulmonary alveolar macrophages obtained from rabbits 2 wk after intravenous injection of complete Freund 's adjuvant bound dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide to high affinity receptor sites ( Table I ) .
Cells adhering to plastic surfaces and cells in suspension bound the glucocorticoid equally well .
The number and affinity of the rabbit macrophage glucocorticoid receptors were similar to that observed for mouse macrophages .
For optimal binding , the macrophages were cultured in serum-free DME-LH for 2-24 h after removal from the lungs .
Dexamethasone bound specifically to receptors with high affinity for glucocorticoids .
As shown in Fig .
4 , dexamethasone , triamcinolone acetonide , and hydrocortisone competed with [ *H ) } dexamethasone for binding to receptors , whereas cortisone , estradiol , and dihydrotestosterone did not .
Human Blood Monocytes .
The rabbit and the mouse are glucocorticoid-sensitive species , whereas man is relatively glucocorticoid resistant ( 2 ) .
It was thus of particular interest to examine the glucocorticoid receptors in human mononuclear phagocytes .
Blood monocytes in monolayer culture bound dexamethasone ( Fig .

was present in the assay at 8 nM .
Thus , the monocyte contained specific binding sites consistent with glucocorticoid action at physiological concentrations .
Discussion The studies reported here show that glucocorticoid receptors are present in intact mononuclear phagocytes from mouse , rabbit , and man .
The dissociation constants found ( Table I ) were =2-8 nM for dexamethasone ; the competition for binding by cortisol at about 10-fold higher concentrations suggests that 1692 MACROPHAGE GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTORS glucocorticoid receptor-mediated functions in macrophages would be operative at physiological concentrations .
The number of receptor sites and their affinity were similar for resident macrophages , macrophages elicited by inflammatory stimuli , and blood monocytes , and they were similar to those reported for lymphoid cells ( 3 , 4 , 16 ) .
Although unstimulated monocytes and macrophages had higher concentrations of steroid receptors than did elicited macrophages , this does not necessarily signify a difference in sensitivity to glucocorticoid action .
Mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes contain several times more receptors than unstimulated lympho-cytes , and yet both populations are equally steroid sensitive ( 16 ) .
In the present study , glucocorticoid binding was examined with dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide as the ligands .
These synthetic glucocorticoids have the advantage of not binding to transcortin , a serum protein that binds cortisol ( 17 ) ; thus , accurate glucocorticoid concentrations could be determined .
Also , experiments were made in the absence of serum to decrease interference from exogenous steroids .
Serum cortisol and progesterone both compete with dexamethasone for binding , and could influence the free steroid concentrations present in the experiments .
In other work we have shown that P388D1 macrophages , a continuous cell line , contain glucocorticoid receptors indistinguishable from those of normal mouse macrophages . ``
We have demonstrated temperature-sensitive transfer of glucocorticoid receptors to macrophage nuclei .
With P388D1 cells we have been able to demonstrate glucocorticoid binding directly to proteins isolated from cytoplasm , temperature-dependent activation of the hormone-receptor complex , and translocation of only activated complexes into isolated nuclei . ``
In virtually every target tissue investigated , the first step in steroid hormone action is the binding of steroid to specific receptor proteins .
Because their specificity and affinity correlate with biological functions , they may mediate the hormone action .
Some effects of glucocorticoids on macrophages have been described previously ; in most experiments , however , pharmacological concentrations of steroids were used ( 2 , 18 ) .
These effects are unlikely to be mediated by the high affinity receptors described in this paper .
In the accompanying paper ( 18 ) hormone effects at glucocorticoid concentrations similar in specificity and affinity to those for receptor characteristics are shown for macrophage secretion and growth .
Summary Glucocorticoid binding was measured in resident and thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages , rabbit alveolar macrophages , and human monocytes .
Two assays of binding were used -an assay with intact cells in suspension or monolayers , and an assay of cytosol and nuclear forms of glucocorticoid receptors .
The mononuclear phagocytes contained =4-10 x 10° high affinity receptor sites per cell , with dissociation constants of =2-8 nM dexamethasone .
The binding to the saturable sites was specific for steroids with glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity .
Cortisol , corticosterone , and progesterone competed with dexamethasone for binding , whereas estradiol , dihy-drotestosterone , and 11-epicortisol competed very little .
ZENA WERB , ROSEMARY FOLEY , AND ALLAN MUNCK 1693 Binding of dexamethasone to cytosol and nuclear forms of the receptor complex and temperature-sensitive translocation of cytosol forms to nuclear forms were shown .
At 37°C the predominant form of the hormone-receptor complex was nuclear .
These results demonstrate that corticosteroids interact with macrophages at physiological concentrations .
