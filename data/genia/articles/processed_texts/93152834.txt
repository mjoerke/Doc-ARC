Expression of tal-1 and GATA-Binding Proteins During Human Hematopoiesis By Marc-Andre Mouthon , Olivier Bernard , Maria-Teresa Mitjavila , Paul-Henri Romeo , William Vainchenker , and Daniele Mathieu-Mahul Tal-1 rearrangements are associated with nearly 30 % of human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
Ta/-1 gene encodes a putative transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix domain and is known to be predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells We investigated the pattern of ta/-1 expression in purified human hematopoietic cells by in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis .
Both methods demonstrated that the ta/-1 gene is expressed in megakaryocytes and erythroblasts as well as in basophilic granulocytes .
In addition , our results indicate that the tal-1 1A promoter , which contains two consensus GATA-binding sites , is active mainly in these lineages .
Because the GATA-1 gene is known to transactivate several genes specific for the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mastocytic/basophilic lineages , we studied HE ftal-1 gene , also called SCL or TCLS5 , was originally identified because of its disruption by the t ( 1 ; 14 ) ( p32 ; q11 ) translocation observed in an immature T-cell line ( DU 528 ) and in the leukemic cells of patients with acute T-cell leukemia ( T-ALL ) .
`` * In addition to the 3 % of patients with T-ALL who display the t ( 1 ; 14 ) translocation , `` an additional 12 % to 25 % of patients with T-ALL without evident 1p32 chromosomal abnormality exhibit two site-specific V ( D ) J recombinase-mediated deletions , fa/ `` `` and tal `` , which affect the 5 ' region of tal-1 gene . ``
These tal `` recombinations occur between the 5 noncoding sequences of tal-1 and another locus centromeric to ta/-1 ( SIL ) and lead to an interstitial deletion of about 100 kb on chromosome 1 .
The SIL gene is transcribed in most of the hematopoietic lineages and notably in T cells . '
'' Recently , the tal-1 gene was found to be juxtaposed with the T-cell receptor 3 chain gene ( TCR-8 ) in the t ( 1 ; 7 ) ( p32 ; q35 ) translocation observed in a patient with T-ALL . ``
In both types of fal-1 alterations ( re-ciprocal translocations or interstitial deletions ) , the coding sequences of ra/-1 are placed under the influence of genes that are normally expressed in the T-cell lineage : the TCR-6 gene in t ( 1 ; 14 ) translocations , the TCR-8 gene in t ( 1 ; 7 ) translocations , or the SIL gene in the case of ta® rearrangements .
Hence , the physiologic consequence of these specific chromosomal rearrangements is the transcriptional deregulation of tal-1 coding sequences in a T-cell clone .
** `` `` ~ `` > Two lines of evidence indicate that the tal-1 gene may play a role in T-cell tumorigenesis .
First , recurrent breakage of ra/-1 is often associated with T-ALL and occurs exclusively in this type of tumor ; second , ta/-1 gene expression is found in several T-cell lines and in leukemic cells from patients with T-ALL , without evident fa/-1 gene alteration .
'*'* Taken together , these observations are more than coincidental and strongly suggest that an inappropriate level of the tal-1 gene product is a critical event in T-cell leukemogenesis .
The most remarkable feature of the putative ta/-1 gene product is that it possesses a domain able to form two am-phiphatic a helices separated by an intervening loop and preceded by a cluster of basic residues that define the bHLH family of transcription factors .
*** `` `` Several members of this family are known to be implicated in mammalian cell growth Blood , Vol 81 , No 3 ( February 1 ) , 1993 : pp 647-655 GATA-1 expression in these purified hematopoietic cells .
We found that GATA-1 and ta/-1 genes are coexpressed in these three lineages .
Remarkably , the expression of both genes is downmodulated during erythroid and megakaryocytic terminal maturation .
In immature hematopoietic cells , tal-1 and GATA-1 genes are coexpressed in committed progenitors cells ( CD34*/CD38*+* ) , whereas they are not detectable in the most primitive cells ( CD34**/CD38- ) .
In contrast , GATA-2 is strongly expressed in both most primitive and committed progenitors cells , whereas GATA-3 is mostly detected in most primitive ones .
Altogether our results strongly suggest that GATA-1 modulates the transcription of ta/-1 during the differentiation of the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and basosophilic lineages .

regulation and differentiation , such as Myc , MyoD , `` ® and the immunoglobulin enhancer-binding proteins E12 and E47 .
The bHLH motif of these proteins is directly responsible for DNA binding and dimerization with other HLH proteins involved in transcription regulation . '
'' `` * Ta/-1 protein is able in vitro , in association with the E47/E12 bHLH proteins , to bind the E box motif found in several eukaryotic transcriptional enhancers , which suggests that ia/-1 heterodimers may also function in vivo as transcriptional regulatory factors that influence cell type determination during hematopoiesis . ``
In previous studies , the ta/-1 gene was found to be expressed only in early myeloid and erythroid leukemic cell lines , whereas no expression was detected in the thymus or in normal peripheral T-lymphocytes . ``
Furthermore , the ta/-1 gene was found to be expressed at high levels in several megakaryocytic cell lines `` `` and murine mast cell lines . ``
'' A recent study `` using an antisense strategy in the erythroleu-kemia cell line K562 suggests that fa/-1 is involved in self-renewal of K562 cells and gives rise to the hypothesis that tal-1 may be involved in the proliferation of normal erythroid cells .
Because most of these studies have been performed on leukemic cell lines , we wanted to investigate the pattern of tal-1 expression in normal hematopoiesis .
To address this question , we defined the bone marrow hematopoietic lineages that express the ta/-1 gene .

648 tal-1 gene is expressed in megakaryocytes , erythroblasts , and basophilic granulocytes and in their progenitor cells .
Interestingly , this pattern of expression parallels that of GATA-1 , which is restricted to erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mastocytic/basophilic lineages .
`` * `` `` In addition , fa/-1 and GATA-1 gene expression is simultaneously downmodulated during terminal differentiation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of Hematopoietic Cells Bone marrow and blood cells .
- Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from normal adult donors after informed consent in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the Committee on Human In-vestigation .
Cells were separated to obtain both low-density cells and granulocytic precursors .
First , total bone marrow cells were depleted of erythrocytes by sedimentation at 1g over a Ficoll-metrizoate gradient ( d = 1.077 g/mL ) ( Seromed , Berlin , Germany ) for 1 hour at room temperature .
Second , free erythrocyte cells were separated by velocity centrifugation at 400g over a Ficoll-metrizoate gradient ( d = 1.077 g/mL ) .
Low-density cells were recovered at the interphase of the gradient , whereas polymorphs , metamyelocytes , and myelocytes were obtained at the bottom of the tube and represented more than 90 % of the nucleated cells present in this cell fraction .
CD34* cells were recovered from the marrow low-density cells by the immunomagnetic bead technique using the anti-CD34 mono-clonal antibody QBENDIO ( a generous gift from Dr M. Greaves , London , UK ) ; the target cell to bead ratio was 1:5 ( Dynabeads M-450 ; Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) .
CD34* cells were isolated using a magnetic particle concentrator and detached by a chymopapain treatment ( 130 U/mL for 2 minutes , repeated two times ) . ``
The CD34* cell recovery was about 1 % of the low-density bone marrow cells .
After May-Griinwald Giemsa staining , the majority ( 85 % to 95 % ) of these cells had the morphology of blast cells .
The purity of this cell fraction was further assessed by immunofluorescence labeling with another anti-CD34 antibody ( My10 , a generous gift from C. Civin , Baltimore , MD ) after an overnight culture , and it was estimated to be over 90 % .
In two other experiments , blood cells collected for autotransplantation in a patient with myeloma after chemotherapy were used to further separate CD34* cells into two fractions CD38* and CD38~ .
Briefly , CD34* cells were first purified by the immunomagnetic bead technique as above , and after an overnight incubation , CD34* cells were labeled with an anti-CD34 ( HPCA-2 ) and an anti-CD38 ( Leu-17 ) .
Both antibodies directly coupled to fluorescein isochiocyanate ( FITC ) and phycoerythrin ( PE ) , respectively , were purchased from Becton Dickinson ( San Jose , CA ) .
These cells were sorted by flow cytometry using an ATC 3000 fluocytometer ( Odam-Bruker , Wissenburg , France ) equipped with a pair of 70-um nozzles and an argon-ion laser ( Innova , 70-4 ; Coherent , Palo Alto , CA ) tuned at 488 nm .
Two populations of CD34* cells were sorted as described `` `` and according to the criteria of cell sorting used by Coulombel et al ( manuscript in preparation ) .
The first population was highly fluorescent for CD34 and negative for CD38 , and the second one was highly fluorescent for CD38 and positive for CD34 .
The first population is greatly enriched in primitive progenitor cells and depleted in commited pro-genitors , whereas the second contains commited-progenitors ( BFU-E , CFU-E , CFU-GM , CFU-MK ) ( Coulombel et al manuscript in preparation ) .
Also , CD34~ cells ( a majority of T lymphocytes and monocytes and a minority of myeloid and erythroid cells ) obtained from the previous immunomagnetic bead separation were studied .
Platelets as well as blood samples were obtained from the Centre de transfusion du Val de Marne ( Créteil , France ) .
Peripheral blood lymphocytes , monocytes , and granulocytes were recovered after Fi- MOUTHON ET AL coll-metrizoate gradient .
Blood from a patient with a chronic myelogenous leukemia was used as a source for basophilic granulocytes .
Thymic cells .
- Human thymus were obtained from children following thymectomy and separated over a Ficoll-metrizoate gradient .
Leukemic samples .
- Leukemic patient samples were provided by the Hematology Department of Hopital Saint-Louis ( Paris , France ) .
They include a chronic myelogenous leukemia ( HAH ) , an acute megakaryoblastic leukemia ( GEHE ) , T-cell acute leukemias ( 109 , FOR , BUF , LAR ) devoid of 1p32 chromosomal rearrangement , and an acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) type 4 according to the French-American-British ( FAB ) classification ( GAU ) .
Cell lines .
- Several human cell lines were studied .
They included HL 60 ( `` promyelocytic ' ) , K 562 ( erythroid ) , UT-7 ( pluripotent with predominant erythroid and MK markers ) , HEL , Dami , Meg-01 , CMK ( cell lines with both erythroid and megakaryocytic markers ) , MOLT-4 , Jurkat , REX , SKW3 ( T-cell lines ) , Nalm-6 ( pre-B-cell line ) , and Raji ( Burkit lymphoma cell line ) .
They were cultured in RPMI or Iscove 's medium in the presence of 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) .
The human factor-dependent cell line UT-7 was grown in Iscove 's medium in the presence of rhIL-3 ( 100 U/mL ) .
Cultures Semisolid culture of marrow cells .
- CD34* cells were cultured by the methylcellulose technique to obtain BFU-E-derived colonies as described . ``
Stimulating factors were 10 % FCS and a combination of recombinant human growth factors : 1 U/mL erythropoietin ( rhEpo ) ( Amersham , Les Ulis , France ) , 50 ng/mL stem cell factor ( rhSCF ) ( Amgen , Thousand Oaks , CA ) , 100 U/mL rhIL-3 ( Immunex , Seattle , Washington , DC ) .
Cultures were incubated in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO ; in air .
After 8 and 12 days of culture , BFU-E-derived colonies were pipetted off under an inverted microscope and pooled in order to obtain a pure population of erythroblasts for in situ hybridization and RNA extraction .
Normal megakaryocyte culture .
- To obtain a large number of megakaryocytes , low-density bone marrow cells were cultured in suspension in the presence of 10 % aplastic serum ( serum from patients having undergone a bone marrow transplantation ) as previously described . ``
After 7 to 14 days in culture , megakaryocytes were morphologically identifiable and represented 5 % to 25 % of the cultured cells .
These cells were directly used for in situ hybridization or further purified for RNA extraction using the immunomagnetic bead technique and the antiplatelet glycoprotein IIIa MoAb Y2-51.5 In Situ Hybridization Preparation of riboprobes .
- Human tal-1 cDNA ( EcoRI , 1.9 kb ) , the 5 end of human GATA-1 cDNA ( HindIII-Sa/l 0.6 kb ) , murine , B-actin ( 600 bp ) , and A bacteriophage ( HindIII-EcoR1I , 947 pb ) were subcloned into plasmids that contain RNA polymerase promoter sites .
Run-off transcripts of appropriate linearized plasmids were synthesized using either 77 , SP6 , or T3 RNA polymerase in a reaction containing 60 of [ a®°S ] -UTP ( 1,200 Ci/mmol ) ( Amersham } according to manufacturer 's instructions ( Promega Biotec , Madison , WI ) and as described . ``
The length of RNA probes was adjusted to an average of approximately 100 to 150 bases by limited alkaline hydrolysis .
The RNA probes were of similar specific activity and size ( determined by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions ) .
By Northern blot , the 1a/-1 P antisense riboprobe showed two bands at the correct sizes using HEL RNAs as a positive control ( data not shown ) .
Cell fixation , hybridization , and washes .
- Experimental conditions for fixation , hybridization , and washes were as described previously `` with some modifications . ``
Cells were washed , cytocentrifuged , and immediately fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) pH 7.4 for 3 minutes at room temperature .

649 RESULTS In situ hybridization .
- It has been reported that the fal-1 gene was expressed in erythroleukemic and immature myeloid cell lines . ``
'' Additional studies on a large survey of well-characterized cell lines indicated that ta/-1 expression also occurred in mast cell lines `` `` and in several T-cell lines devoid of evident tal-1 gene alteration.® `` `` However , all these studies were performed with human and murine established cell lines .
To assess the expression of fa/-1 in the hematopoietic system , we undertook in situ hybridization studies on normal human hematopoietic cells .
In previous studies on cell lines , the pattern of ta/-1 expression appeared to resemble that of the specific transcription factor Therefore , we decided to perform this analysis in parallel for both genes .
Sense riboprobes and an irrelevant probe ( derived from A phage DNA ) were used as negative controls , and the positive control was an antisense B actin probe .
In the first set of experiments , we investigated the presence of tal-1 transcripts in normal bone marrow granulocytic cells { ( myelocytes , metamyelocytes , and polymorphs ) .
The number of silver grains observed with the ta/-1 antisense probe did not exceed that obtained with different negative controls .
Similarly , no hybridization could be detected with the GATA-1 probe , whereas a clear hybridization was obtained with the B-actin probe ( data not shown ) .
In the second set of experiments , fa/-1 transcription was studied in peripheral blood lymphocytes , monocytes , and granulocytes .
Among granulocytes , only neutrophilic and eosinophilic cells were detected on the slides .
A pattern of hybridization similar to that of bone marrow granulocytic cells was observed in all of these cell types ( ie , no hybridization with ta/-1 and GATA-1 antisense probes ) , whereas the actin probe always gave a signal in these cells ( Fig 1 ) .
To study the basophilic lineage , blood granulocytes from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia were used as a source of basophilic granulocytes .
Among granulocytes , only the basophilic ones hybridized with the ta/-1 probe as well as with the GATA-1 probe ( Fig 1 ) .
To check that we were not confusing silver grains and cytoplasmic granules of the basophilic granulocytes , several slides were counterstained with toludine blue , and the silver grains did not co-localize with the coloration .
In addition , these basophilic granulocytes show an hybridization signal only with the ta/-1 , GATA-1 and actin probes but not with the negative control ( data not shown ) .
Low-density marrow cells were subsequently analyzed , and hybridization with the fa/-1 antisense probe was positive in a minority of cells that could be classified into three main cytologic types : first , cells with a blast morphology ( repre-senting less than 1 % of the low-density marrow cells ) ; second , rare megakaryocytes present on smears ; and third , erythro-blast-like cells ( which were difficult to identify because their cytoplasm remained unstained despite multiple counter-staining techniques ) .
These three cell types were also positive with the GATA-1 and the B-actin probes ( Fig 1 ) .
Immature marrow cells were purified by an antibody anti-CD34 antigen .
This cell population was contaminated by less than 5 % of CD34~ cells , which were essentially granu- From www .

locytes .
The CD34* population contained 10 % to 20 % hematopoietic progenitors associated with immature hematopoietic precursors .
Hybridization was quantified by counting the number of silver grains on each cell ( Fig 2 ) .
About 20 % of CD34* cells clearly expressed transcripts , as shown by at least a twofold to threefold increase in the hybridization level over the two negative controls ( the sense and the A phage probes ) .
A same pattern of hybridization was obtained with GATA-1 ( Figs 1 and 2 ) .
To obtain a pure population of erythroblasts , pooled BFU-E-derived colonies were recovered at day 8 of culture and investigated by in situ hybridization .
fa/-1 Transcripts were detected in 70 % of day-8 erythroblastic cells ( Fig 2 ) .
The cells that did not hybridize with the probe were much smaller than the others and had a small round nucleus ( Fig 1 ) , but their morphology remained difficult to study because we were unable to counterstain their cytoplasm .
Control slides , therefore , were stained with benzidine and 15 % of these cells were positive .
We compared their morphology with that of the in situ hybridization slides , and identified the ta/-1-negative cells as acidophilic erythroblasts .
This suggests that the level of tal-1 transcription decreased during erythroid maturation .
This was further confirmed by studying BFU-E-derived colonies at later days of culture .
At day 12 of culture , when 60 % of erythroblasts are benzidine positive , only 35 % of the erythroblasts hybridized with the ra/-1 probe .
In parallel , a decrease of GATA-1 expression was observed in acidophilic erythro-blast ( Fig 1 ) .
This was further shown by a decrease of the specific hybridization with GATA-1 probe in erythroblasts from 65 % at day 8 to 35 % at day 12 .
The specificity of the fa/-1 antisense hybridization on erythroblasts was checked by treating the cells with RNase before hybridization .
As expected , pretreatment of cells with both RNases A and TI diminished the hybridization with tal-1 antisense to the level obtained with the negative control probes .
In contrast , the background of hybridization obtained with both negative control probes was not modified by RNase treatment ( data not shown ) .
The most proeminent hybridization was observed on megakaryocytes obtained after 10 days of culture ( Figs 1 and 2 ) .
As with erythroblasts , a larger quantity of fa/-1 mRNA was expressed in the immature megakaryocytes , identified by their basophilic cytoplasm and obtained at day 7 of culture , than in mature megakaryocytes obtained at day 10 of culture ( Fig 3 ) .
Similar observations were found with the GATA-1 probe .
These results suggest that the absolute level of fa/-1 and GATA-1 mRNA per cell decreased during megakaryocytic maturation .

- Expression of tal-1 and GATA-1 mRNAs in hematopoietic cells .
CD34* ( A } , erythroblasts ( B ) , and megakaryocytes ( C ) were hybridized as described in Materials and Methods section with ta/-1 sense or the \ probe ( white column ) as negative controls or ta/-1 antisense ( black column ) and GATA-1 antisense ( gray column ) riboprobes .
The number of silver grains were counted on more than 30 cells .
Cells were classified into several classes according to their number of silver grains .
The relative frequency of cells in each class was calculated and represented as mean + standard deviation ( error bars ) of three repeated in situ hybridization experiments .
PCR experiments .
- We undertook the characterization of tal-1 transcripts in different cell populations derived from normal bone marrow and hematopoietic tissues .
f @ /-1 Transcription was studied by PCR analysis on mRNA , as already described . ``
To ascertain the integrity of the RNA samples and to monitor the PCR product level , the housekeeping gene , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GGPD ) , was used as an internal standard during PCR reactions .
In a first set of experiments , we chose two fa/-1 primers ( Z8 and Z11 ) , which amplify the bHLH domain sequences present in all fal-1 mRNA species described so far . ``
'' For this analysis , we used a series of RNAs extracted from normal hematopoietic tissues ( bone marrow , thymus , fetal liver ) , from normal purified cell populations ( erythroblasts , megakaryocytes , CD34* cells from bone marrow , peripheral blood granulocytes ) , from leukemic samples , and from well-char- 651 acterized hematopoietic cell lines .
The resulting autoradio-gram is presented on Fig 4 and summarized on Table 1 .
As expected , a specific ta/-1 fragment ( 134 bp ) was observed in the lane corresponding to cell line HEL ( erythroid/mega-karyocyte ) RNA used as a positive control .
This fragment was also found in the lanes corresponding to the pluripotent UT-7 cell line , the erythroid K562 cell line , the erythroid/ megakaryocyte CMK , Dami , and Meg-01 cell lines , the Nalm-6 pre-B-cell line , and to T-cell lines without fa/-1 rearrangement .
In contrast , no PCR product was amplified from the Raji B-cell line RNA used as negative control .
A clear expression was also observed in samples from acute megakaryoblastic ( GEHE ) , chronic myelogenous leukemias ( HAH ) , M4 leukemia ( GAU ) , and in most cases of T-ALL devoid of ta/-1 gene rearrangement .
In normal tissue , a clear expression was observed in fetal liver cells at 12 and 22 weeks , as well as in total bone marrow .
In purified normal cells , fa/-1 expression was evident in erythroblasts obtained from 8-day cultures , megakaryocytes obtained from 10-day cultures , and in CD34* cells .
These results mirrored those of the in situ hybridization experiments .
PCR product was also detected in platelets and in peripheral blood granulocytes .
As in results obtained previously , no ta/-1 PCR product was detected in circulating B cells or T cells .
A faint transcription was visible in thymus , including low-density thymic cells ( 96 % of T cells ) .
This result suggests that only a minor subpopulation of thymic cells expresses ta/-1 gene .
Taken together , the data of this assay were in total accordance with those of in situ hybridization experiments .
The tal-1 gene displays a complex pattern of transcription .
Indeed , multiple mRNA species have been identified which 60 7 # - 501 : < $ - 401 8 .

are initiated at two different first exons ( 1A and 1B ) and produced by alternative exon utilization.® `` * Previous study on leukemic cell lines had suggested that the pattern of utilization of the two promoters was cell lineage dependent . ``
To identify which promoter was actually active in the various hematopoietic lineages , we performed RT-PCR experiments using two different couples of primers , ZA/Z8 and Z13/29 , which allowed us to identify transcripts initiated respectively at 1A and 1B .
The results are presented on Table 1 .
The 1A promoter is used in all normal and leukemic cells derived from the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages and in Nalm-6 ( pre-B ) , but it is not used in T-cell lineage except in one case of T-ALL ( patient BUF ) .
In contrast , the 1B promoter is used by both lymphoid and erythroid cells , whereas it is not used in granulocytic and megakaryocytic cells .
Finally , to check whether fa/-1 was co-expressed with GATA-1 or with other GATA genes in early hematopoiesis , CD34°*/CD38~ , CD34*/CD38®¢ , and CD34~ cells were sorted and probed by RT-PCR for ia/-1 and GATA-1 , GATA-2 , and GATA-3 genes .
`` * `` ' Two independent experiments were performed and gave identical results ( Fig 5 ) .
The fa/-1 and GATA-1 transcripts were present in and CD34~ cells , whereas they were not detectable in CD34°*/ CD38~ cells .
In contrast , GATA-2 is expressed in the three cell populations but in larger amount in the two CD34 * cell populations .
In addition , GATA-3 is strongly expressed in CD34 , cells and to a lesser extent in CD34°*/CD38~ cells .
DISCUSSION Despite the frequent involvement of the fa/-1 gene in T-cell malignancies , its expression has not been detected in peripheral T-cell organs ( PBL , lymph nodes ) but in hematopoietic tissues , which suggests that the activation of fa/-1 in a T-cell clone may be an oncogenic event .
Several sets of evidence indicate that fa/-1 expression is related to normal erythroid differentiation .
Indeed , in normal tissues , it has until now only been detected at high levels in fetal liver cells .
In addition , a/-1 transcription was described in human and murine erythroid leukemic cell lines , as well as in mast and early myeloid leukemic cell lines .
However , it seemed important to study /a/-1 expression in normal cells for two rea-sons .
First , the putative fa/-1 oncogene may be abnormally expressed in a malignant cell line , where it is assumed to participate in the leukemic process .
Second , many cell lines have an aberrant phenotype that renders them difficult to compare with normal differentiation .

for the HEL cell line , in which a high level of ta/-1 mRNA is found and that expresses simultaneously many specific erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation markers .
By studying normal hematopoietic cells , it was possible to demonstrate both by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR that tal-1 mRNA was present in normal erythroid cells .
Its expression clearly decreased with differentiation .
This result contrasts with those observed during induction of differentiation of murine erythroleukemic cell lines by dimethyl sulf-oxide ( DMSO ) , which was associated with a high increase in the fal-1 mRNA level . ``
This rise of fa/-1 transcription was not an early event because it reached a maximum after 4 days of induction .
In contrast , in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 , tal/-1 gene product seems to have a major role in the self-renewal capacities of leukemic cells and its inhibition is associated with a differentiation of the cell line . ``
In addition , our results show that fa/-1 mRNA is also expressed during megakaryocytic differentiation and that its 653 absolute level per cell decreased during differentiation , although it is still present in platelets .
In this study , we detected the transcript by in situ hybridization in basophilic granulocytes from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia , whereas it was not detected in neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes .
This result suggests that the transcripts detected by RT-PCR in peripheral blood granulocytes are related to the presence of tal-1 gene transcripts in normal basophils .
In the mouse , 1a/-1 transcripts were detected in mast cell lines . ``

654 Interestingly , a proportion of CD34* cells expressed ta/-1 gene .
Fractionation of this cell population allows us to demonstrate that fa/-1 is not expressed in the cell fraction with the most primitive phenotype ( CD34°*/CD38~ ) but is present in the cell fraction with the phenotype of committed progenitors Our in situ hybridization studies have detected GATA-1 and tal- mRNAs in the same hematopoietic lineages .
GATA-1 is known as a transcription factor specific for the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cell lineages .
`` * `` * `` `` Furthermore , we report that GATA-1 is expressed in the same fraction of CD34* than tal-1 , which mainly correspond to commited progenitors and not to primitive hematopoietic cells .
In contrast , GATA-2 and GATA-3 have clearly distinct patterns of expression and were both detected in the most primitive cells .
Altogether our data indicate that ta/-1 and GATA-1 are coexpressed during differentiation of the erythroid , basophilic , and megakaryocytic lineages from the committed progenitors to the mature cells .
These results are in accordance with recent datas on multiple leukemic cell lines . ``
'' Finally , several findings suggest indirectly that GATA-1 modulates the expression of fa/-1 during normal hematopoietic differentiation .
First , GATA sequences are present in the 1A promoter of both human and mouse ( a/-1 genes* `` * ( Lecointe et al , submitted ) .
Second , in the lineages where fa/-1 is highly expressed ( ie , erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast/ basophilic ) , 1 A is the predominantly active promoter , whereas the 1B promoter appears not be used in granulocytes and megakaryocytes ( this article ) .
Third , GATA-1 product is able to transactivate specific genes of these lineages .
`` `` > * > * Fourth , tal-1 and GATA-1 are expressed in the same hematopoietic cells and are simultaneously downmodulated during late differentiation .
Therefore , one can speculate that GATA-1 permits tal- to be transcribed in the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast/basophilic lineages .
However , GATA-2 and GATA-3 are also co-expressed with ta/-1 in several cellular types ; ie , mast cells and developing brain cells , respectively .
`` `` * This implicates that GATA-binding proteins , different from GATA-1 , could also regulate the transcription of fa/-1 .
Further experiments are required to directly demonstrate which GATA-binding protein ( s ) transactivate ( s ) the fa/-1 gene .
