The molecular changes associated with chronic phase to blast crisis transition are largely unknown .
We have identified a cDNA clone , DR-nm23 , differentially expressed in a blast-crisis cDNA library , which has ~70 % sequence similarity to the putative metastatic suppressor genes , nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 .
The deduced amino acid sequence similarity to the proteins encoded by these two latter genes is ~65 % and includes domains and amino acid residues ( the leucine zipper-like and the RGD domain , a serine and a histidine residue in the NH ; - and in the COOH-terminal portion of the protein , respectively ) postulated to be important for nm23 function .
DR-nm23 mRNA is preferentially expressed at early stages of myeloid differentiation of highly purified CD34+* cells .
Its constitutive expression in the myeloid precursor 32Dc13 cell line , which is growth-factor dependent for both proliferation and differentiation , results in inhibition of granulocytic differentiation induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and causes apoptotic cell death .
These results are consistent with a role for DR-nm23 in normal hematopoiesis and raise the possibility that its overexpression contributes to differentiation arrest , a feature of blastic transformation in chronic myelogenous leukemia .
Hematopoiesis is a regulated developmental cascade that generates at least eight distinct lineages that differentiate into mature blood cells ( 1 ) .
Central to the process are pluripotent stem cells which generate multipotent and unipotent progenitor cells , whose continuous regeneration is essential to hematopoietic homeostasis .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) is a malignancy of the human hematopoietic stem cell characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) ( 2 ) and , at the molecular level , juxtaposition of 5 ' coding sequences of the breakpoint cluster region ( ber ) gene on chromosome 22 and 3 ' coding sequences of the c-abl gene on chromosome 9 ( 3 ) .
Clinically , CML presents initially as a chronic phase characterized by an increased number of immature myeloid precursor cells which retain the ability to terminally differentiate .
Three to five years after diagnosis , CML usually progresses first to an accelerated phase with a duration of 1-1.5 years and then into a rapidly fatal blastic phase , characterized by growth advantage and differentiation arrest of CML blast cells .
Although the prognostic factors associated with the disease process are better known than in the past ( 4 ) , the molecular mechanisms involved in chronic phase to blast transition remain elusive .
The objective of the work described here was the identification of genes which may have a pathogenetic role The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .
This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement `` in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
7435 in this transition .
To this purpose , we selected by differential screening cDNA clones preferentially expressed in CML-blast crisis ( CML-BC ) cells .
One such gene , related to members of the nm23 tumor suppressor gene family , appears to be involved in hematopoiesis and perhaps in leukemogenesis , as indicated by its ability , when overexpressed , to suppress granulocytic differentiation of myeloid precursor 32Dc13 cells .
$ MATERIALS AND METHODS Screening of a CML-BC cDNA Library .
A CML-BC cDNA library was prepared in the pcDNA I vector according to the method of Gubler and Hoffman ( 5 ) and manufacturer 's modifications ( Invitrogen ) .
A total of 2 x 10° colonies of the CML-BC cDNA library were screened by differential hybridization of replicate filters ( 6 ) with *P-labeled cDNA probes ( 2 x 10°/ml ) generated by reverse transcription of poly ( A ) * RNA from either the CCRF-CEM cell line or CML-BC primary cells .
Differentially hybridizing clones were subjected to two additional rounds of differential screening .
One clone ( clone 126 ) was identified and characterized .
DNA Sequencing .
Double-stranded DNA sequencing of plasmid DNA was performed with Sequenase ( United States Biochemical ) and synthetic oligonucleotide primers by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method .
RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis .
Total RNA extracted by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method ( 7 ) was electrophoresed ( 20 ug per lane ) through 1.2 % agarose gels containing 0.66 M formaldehyde and Mops buffer ( 40 mM Mops , pH 7.2/10 mM sodium acetate mM EDTA ) and blotted onto Zetabind membrane ( Cuno ) .
Clone 126 insert or the full-length cDNA ( see below ) was used as a probe after random primer labeling with ( 8 ) .
Cloning of Full-Length DR-nm23 .
DR-nm23 , identified as a sequence ( clone 126 ) that is differentially expressed in CML-BC cells relative to CCRF-CEM cells , contained an insert of 652 bp that lacked the initiation codon and was shorter than the corresponding RNA transcripts detected by Northern blot hybridization .
The full-length cDNA was cloned in four successive steps : ( ? )
a K562 cDNA library in Agt1l0 was screened to identify additional DR-nm23 clones ; ( i ) after identification of several positive clones , the longest EcoRI insert ( 820 bp ) was inserted into the EcoRI restriction site of pBluescript SK plasmid vector ( Stratagene ) and named pDR-12 .
Sequence analysis revealed that it was still lacking the region around the initiation codon ; ( ii ? )

cental genomic library in Lambda FIX II ( Stratagene ) was screened with a P-labeled insert of DR-nm23 .
Clone 1 contained the entire coding region of DR-nm23 within a BamHI-Not 1 1450-bp fragment ; ( iv ) clone DR-12 was digested with EcoRI to release the 820-bp insert .
This insert was then digested with Mbo II and an 804-bp fragment was isolated .
The genomic BamHI-Not I insert from clone 1 was digested with Mbo II and a 45-bp fragment was isolated .
This 45-bp fragment was then ligated via a triple-component ligation with the 804-bp fragment into the BamHI- and EcoRI-digested pBluescript SK vector .
The resulting clones , designated DR-9 and DR-11 , were sequenced and shown to contain the full-length cDNA with an ATG initiation codon and an in-frame TAG stop codon .
Cloning of pLXSN-DR-nm23 .
For cloning into mammalian expression vectors , the majority of the 3 ' untranslated region of the full-length DR-nm23 cDNA was removed by Rsa I digestion .
The resulting 698-bp fragment was blunt-ended and ligated to plasmid pLXSN ( 9 ) , digested with Xho I , and then blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I .
The resulting plasmid , designated pLXSN-DR-nm23 , also confers resistance to the antibiotic G418 .
Cloning of Hemagglutinin ( HA ) -Tagged DR-nm23 .
The full-length DR-nm23 cDNA was excised by digestion of the pBluescript SK plasmid first with BamHI and EcoRI and then with Bsr I , generating two fragments ( 499 and 365 nt , respec-tively ) , the longer of which contained most of DR-nm23 coding region .
Oligonucleotides ( F , 5-TGTATGAGCAGG , and G , 5'-AATTCCTGCTCATACAGC ) not including the TAG stop codon , which was replaced by CAG , were annealed to yield a double-stranded DNA oligomer flanked by Bsr I and EcoRI recognition sequence overhangs .
Recombinant DR-nm23 devoid of the TAG codon was generated by ligation of the annealed primers with the 499-bp fragment into a Bam HI- and EcoRI-digested pBluescript SK plasmid .
This plasmid was designated pSKDR-nm23mutC .
From plasmid pSKA-myb 5 HA3 ( 10 ) , the triple HA epitope was excised by digestion with Xho I and Sal I and inserted in the Xho I recognition site of pSKDR-nm23mutC .
To maintain the construct in frame , an extra nucleotide was inserted by PCR .
A 5° primer ( 5'-GTCGACCTCGAGGCCACCATGG-3 ' ) and the T7 RNA polymerase promoter site primer were used on the template plasmid pSKDR-nm23mutC to generate a 163-bp product .
This was cleaved with Xho I and Kpn I and inserted into Xho I- and Kpn I-digested pSKDR-nm23mutC .
The reading frame was verified by sequencing .
This construct was called pSKDR-nm23HA3 .
Cell Culture and Primary Cells .
The murine interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) -dependent myeloid cell line 32Dc13 ( 11 ) was used .
For proliferation studies , 5 % 104 cells per ml were plated in 4 ml of Iscove 's modified Dulbecco 's medium ( IMDM ) supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 15 % ( vol/vol ) WEHI ( IL-3 producer ) conditioned medium .
For differentiation studies , 2.5 X 10° cells per ml were plated in 4 ml of IMDM supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) conditioned medium from the U8S7MG [ granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) producer ] cell line .
Human hematopoietic progenitor cells were purified from the peripheral blood of healthy donors by a four-step procedure ( 12 ) and cultured as described ( 12 ) .
Detection of DR-nm23 and Myeloperoxidase mRNAs in CD34* and in 32Dc13 Cells .
RNA was extracted from cultured CD34* and 32Dc13 cells as described ( 7 , 12 ) .
After first-strand cDNA synthesis using 10-30 ng of extracted RNA , DR-nm23 mRNA expression was analyzed by PCR ( 25 cycles ; 5 ' primer , 5-GCACCTTCCTGGCCGTGAAG-3 ' ; 3 ' primer , 5'-AGG-TGCGCACCACGTCCAG-3 ' ) and detected by Southern hybridization with a [ y- > °P ] JATP end-labeled oligonucleotide probe ( 5-TAGTGCTCACGCAGCAGCT-3 ' ) specific for the amplified sequence .

T-cell line CCRF-CEM as the probe led to the identification of several clones preferentially expressed in CML-BC cells .
Sequence analysis of one such clone revealed an approximately 70 % sequence similarity to the mRNA sequence of the nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 genes , postulated to act as metastatic suppressor genes ( 14 , 15 ) .
This clone was named DR-n » m23 .
The originally identified clone was only 652 bp long , did not contain an ATG initiation codon in the context of the canonical consensus sequence for translation initiation ( 16 ) , and hybridized to 0.8- to 1.0-kb mRNA species .
Thus , primer extension analysis performed on RNA derived from CML-BC and CCRF-CEM cells revealed two extension products in the RNA of expressor cells , in agreement with the existence of two mRNA transcripts of 0.8-1.0 kb ( data not shown ) .
The full-length DR-nm23 cDNA , obtained as described in Materials and Methods , is 849 bp long and contains an open reading frame for a predicted protein of 168 amino acids ( Fig .
1 ) .
The nucleotide sequence around the first ATG was CCATCATGT , similar to the consensus sequence [ CC ( A/G ) CCATGG ] for eukaryotic mRNA translation initiation ( 16 ) .
In vitro translation of DRnm23 into the transcription/translation vector pcDNA3 generated a protein of approximately 18,000 Da ( data not shown ) .

Each lane is representative of three independent experiments with similar results .
nm23-H2 proteins have a putative leucine-zipper domain ( 17 ) .
A similar leucine zipper-like structure present in the DR-nm23 protein spans from amino acid 60 to 84 and shares 54 % and 45.8 % sequence identity with the nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 proteins , respectively .
An RGD motif , implicated in cell attachment to fibronectin and other proteins involved in cell adhesion ( 18 ) , is conserved in the nm23 proteins ; such a motif and the surrounding amino acids are also maintained in the DR-nm23 protein ( Fig .
2 , in boldface type ) .
A serine residue at position 44 in the nm23 protein , a major phosphorylation site found to correlate with suppression of cell metastatic potential ( 19 ) , and a histidine residue at position 118 of the nm23 protein that is critical for its nucleoside-diphosphate kinase activity ( 19 ) are present in the predicted amino acid sequence of DR-nm23 at residues 61 and 134 , respectively .
DR-nm23 Expression During Myeloid Differentiation in Vitro .
To determine the pattern of DR-nm23 expression during hematopoietic differentiation , human peripheral blood CD34* cells obtained from healthy donors were induced to differentiate toward the myeloid pathway .
At day 0 and after 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 14 , and 16 days of in vitro differentiation , cells were collected and assessed for DR-nm23 expression ( Fig .

DISCUSSION By differential screening of a CML-BC cDNA library , we have isolated a gene with sequence homology to nm23-H1I and nm23-H2 , originally identified as putative metastatic suppressor genes .
The encoded protein has ~65 % amino acid similarity to nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 .
A putative leucine-zipper domain and the RGD domain implicated in integrin recognition in proteins involved in cell attachment ( 18 ) are conserved among the different proteins .
Their relevance for nm23 function is unknown , in part because the precise role of nm23 in normal processes , such as proliferation , differentiation , and neoplastic transformation , is still controversial .
It was originally reported that nm23 mRNA levels were uniformly reduced in rodent cell lines with high metastatic potential and in lymph-node metastases of human infiltrating ductal breast carcinomas ( 14 ) .
Of greater importance , » n » m23-transfected , highly metastatic melanoma cells exhibited reduced incidence of primary tumor formation , significant reduction in tumor metastatic potential , and altered response to transforming growth factor B1 compared with untransfected parental cells ( 15 ) .
However , metastatic phenotype and nm23 expression are positively correlated in pancreatic , prostatic , and ovarian carcinomas ( 21-23 ) and in neuroblastomas ( 24 ) , thus raising the possibility that nm23 exerts distinct functions in different tissue types .
nm23 levels correlated with proliferation in mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes and decreased during terminal differentiation of HL-60 cells ( 25 ) .
In agreement with these observations , a differentiation-in-hibiting factor for mouse myeloid leukemic M1 cells was identified as the nm23 protein ( 26 ) and constitutive expression of a full-length n » m23 cDNA inhibited differentiation of MEG-01 , but not K562 , cells ( 27 ) .
The kinetics of DR-nm23 mRNA expression during myeloid differentiation of CD34 * cells ( Fig .
3 ) supports a role for this gene during early stages of hematopoietic differentiation and is consistent with its identification by differential screening of a CML-BC cDNA library .
In this regard , comparison of DR-nm23 levels in chronic phase and blast crisis samples consistently revealed higher expression levels in the blast crisis group ( data not shown ) .
Of greater importance , constitutive expression of DR-nm23 in 32Dc13 cells prevented G-CSF-induced granulocyte differentiation and caused apoptosis of these cells ( Figs .
5-7 ) .
The phenotype of DR-nm23-transfected 32Dc13 cells is reminiscent of that described for Evi-1-transfected 32D¢c13 cells ( 28 ) .
In both cases , transfected cells require IL-3 for their growth , manifest a block in differentiation upon IL-3 removal and addition of G-CSF , and rapidly undergo cell death .
This phenotype is distinct from that induced by constitutive expression of v-ab/ or which , instead , involves both IL-3 independence and the inability to differentiate in response to G-CSF ( 29 , 30 ) .
As differentiation arrest is a feature of CML-BC , the phenotype of DR-nm23-transfected 32Dc13 cells might be relevant to explain the alteration of the hematopoietic differentiation program typical of that disease stage .
In contrast , in chronic phase , CML progenitor cells retain the ability to differentiate , despite the expression of the BCR-ABL protein , consistent with the limited leukemogenic potential of BCR-ABL proteins ( 31 , 32 ) .
Since BCR-ABL expression prolongs the survival of CML myeloid cells by inhibiting apoptosis ( 20 ) , it is tempting to speculate that coexpression of BCR-ABL and of a gene like DR-nm23 generates a cell phenotype resembling that of CML-BC blast cells .

USA 92 ( 1995 ) 7439 The mechanism ( s ) associated with the differentiation arrest and induction of apoptosis in DR-nm23-transfected 32Dc13 cells is , at the moment , unknown .
Thus far , we could not find evidence of changes in the expression of genes , such as p53 , bel2 , and c-myc , that negatively or positively regulate the induction of apoptosis .
Analysis of the effects associated with mutation of the putative nm-23 functional domains is expected to provide relevant information on the pathway involved in the DR-nm23-induced phenotype .
