, Bethesda Naval Hospital , Bethesda , Maryland 20814 Abstract Terminal differentiation of the leukemic cell lines U937 and HL-60 by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate is accompanied by marked changes in gene expression .
In this study , we demonstrate that the expression of jun and fos gene family members is induced with variable kinetics during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced differentiation , with c-jun expression best paralleling differentiation .
The generation of AP-1 complexes , as measured by DNA binding activity , closely parallels morphological differentiation .
Furthermore , the ability of these complexes to regulate gene expression is demonstrated by increased transcription from an AP-1 driven reporter construct and marked increases in the expression of endogenous AP-1 regulated genes .
Differentiation assays using water soluble phorbol esters reveal that differentiation becomes irreversible soon after AP-1 appears .
This tight correlation between c-jun expression , the generation of AP-1 activity , and differentiation suggests a critical role for this gene and transcriptional complex during this process .
Introduction Phorbol esters such as TPA `` have been shown to induce monocyte/macrophage differentiation in human leukemic cell lines such as U-937 and HL-60 ( 1-3 ) .
This differentiation process is characterized by morphological and functional changes such as adherence , pseudopod formation , phagocytic capability , and the induction of enzymes such as lysozyme and nonspecific esterase ( 2 , 3 ) .
The cascade of molecular events characterizing and mediating this dramatic process is poorly understood .
Changes in expression have been noted for protoonco-genes involved in cell proliferation such as c-myc ( 4 , 5 ) and c-myb ( 6 ) , as well as a variety of other genes , such as c-fms ( 7 ) and c-fes ( 8 ) .

More recent work has begun to focus on genes whose protein products have been identified as key regulatory transcription factors .
One such class of genes , the `` early response genes , `` were originally identified as genes whose expression is rapidly induced by exposure to serum or growth factors ( 9 ) .
The jun and fos protoonco-genes and their related gene family members are proto-typic examples of this .
These genes are induced by a wide variety of growth factors and cytokines in a number of different cell lines ( 10-16 ) .
The protein products of c-jun and c-fos associate to form the AP-1 transcription activator complex ( 17-19 ) .
This complex was first characterized as a DNA binding protein that binds to the consensus sequence TGAC ( G ) TCA , which , in turn , has been shown to be identical to the TPA-inducible enhancer , the TPA responsive element ( 20-23 ) .
Thus , it has been hypothesized that some of the biological effects of TPA are mediated in part by c-jun and c-fos through the generation of AP-1 .
It is reasonable to assume , then , that jun and fos gene family members may be important genes in TPA induced hemopoietic differentiation .
Preliminary work has already shown that the expression of these genes changes during the process of differentiation ( 24-26 ) .
However , the exact time course of expression , the contribution from the various family members , and the functional role they play remain unknown .
In this study , we show that mRNA expression of jun and fos gene family members is markedly induced by TPA in U-937 and HL-60 cells and that AP-1 DNA binding activity is induced concurrently with c-jun expression .
In addition , we demonstrate that TPA can induce transcription from an AP-1 containing reporter construct transfected into U-937 cells , thus establishing that functional AP-1 complexes are indeed induced during TPA induced macrophage differentiation .
The correlation between the generation of AP-1 activity and differentiation suggests a role for this transcription complex in macrophage differentiation .
Results `` Early Response Gene `` mRNA Expression during TPA Induced Macrophage Differentiation .
The pattern of mRNA expression of early response genes in U-937 and HL-60 cells in response to 100 nm TPA was studied by Northern blot analysis .
When treated with 100 nm TPA , U-937 cells become almost perfectly spherical and begin to adhere within 30 min .
By 24 h , greater than 60 % of cells are adherent in clumps , with occasional flattened cells exhibiting pseudopods ( macrophages ) .

c-jun expression is low at baseline but is markedly induced within 30 min of TPA treatment .

- Induction of mRNA expression of jun and fos gene family members in U-937 cells treated with TPA .
U-937 cells were treated with 100 nm TPA from 0 to 96 h , and total cellular RNA was isolated at the times indicated .
One blot was hybridized with probes to c-jun and c-fos , and a separate blot was used for jun-B , jun-D , and fra-1 .
Differences in RNA loading were examined by probing with the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase ( CAD ) .
This gene was selected over the more commonly used B-actin because it exhibited only slight down-regulation with differentiation ( 2- to 3-fold at 72 to 96 h ) as compared with the more dramatic effect seen with B-actin ( results not shown ; see Ref .
48 ) .
peak at 24 h. c-jun mRNA levels subsequently decline slowly .
Low levels of jun-B are also present at baseline , increase markedly by 60 min , and thereafter decline .
jun-D levels rise more gradually to peak at 4 h post-TPA , remaining elevated at 72 h and slowly declining thereafter .
In contrast , c-fos mRNA levels are markedly induced at 30 min , peak at 60 min , and then sharply decline immediately to a level just above baseline .
On the other hand , fra-1 mRNA levels have a less sharp induction but more prolonged duration of expression than c-fos levels , peaking at 2 to 4 h post-TPA and declining to barely detectable levels by 72 h. Morphological differentiation under the influence of TPA proceeds more rapidly in HL-60 cells than in U-937 cells , Within 4 h of treatment , most cells are in adherent clusters , with many flattened macrophage-liked cells ap-parent .
Fig .
2 shows patterns of mRNA expression of jun and fos gene family members in response to 100 nm TPA in HL-60 cells .
In agreement with this more rapid morphological differentiation , molecular changes in TPA induced HL-60 cells also seem to be accelerated .
c-jun mRNA is barely detectable at baseline but rises markedly by 10 h. However , substantial levels of c-jun mRNA are already present at 4 h of TPA treatment , when morphological signs of differentiation are first evident in culture .
Unlike U-937 , in which c-jun mRNA expression appears to have a biphasic pattern , HL-60 c-jun mRNA expression appears to have a single , broader peak extending from 10 to 120 h post-TPA .
Significant baseline levels of jun-B are expressed , with a marked induction within 30 min of TPA treatment and subsequent high levels maintained until 120 h. This pattern differs from that seen in U-937 in that jun-B mRNA in HL-60 remains elevated along with c-jun mRNA for 120 h post-TPA , whereas in U-937 , junB decreases while c-jun rises .
jun-D levels rise more gradually to a plateau between 4 and 18 h post-TPA and fall very slightly thereafter , in a fashion similar to U-937 .
The c-fos mRNA pattern is also similar to that seen in U-937 , with a marked induction of expression within 30 min of TPA treatment and a sharp subsequent decline .
Finally , fra-1 levels peak within 2 h and decline to baseline levels within 18 to 24 h , as in U-937 .
c-jun mRNA Is not Induced during Granulocytic Differentiation .
HL-60 cells have the capacity to undergo granulocytic differentiation under the influence of a variety of agents including retinoic acid and DMSO ( 3 ) .
Fig .
3 shows the levels of c-jun mRNA expression in HL-60 cells after exposure to these two agents or TPA .
Whereas TPA causes a clear rise in c-jun within 4 h , neither 1 % DMSO nor 1 um retinoic acid induces c-jun within 24 h. To confirm that the cells were induced to differentiate , the blot was also hybridized with a probe to c-myc , since a decline in c-myc characterizes differentiation .
It is clear that while all of these agents induce terminal differentiation , c-jun is induced only during macrophage differentiation .
AP-1 DNA Binding Activity in Response to TPA .
The protein products of the jun and fos family members are known to act as transcriptional regulators by binding to DNA as components of the AP-1 complex .
In an effort to answer the question whether AP-1 complexes are induced during differentiation , we examined AP-1 DNA binding activity in U-937 and HL-60 cells during TPA induced differentiation .
Fig .
4 shows the AP-1 DNA binding activity in U-937 cells at various times after treatment with 100 nm TPA .
Minimal detectable AP-1 DNA binding activity exists in untreated cells , consistent with the low levels of jun and fos gene expression seen at baseline .
Significant activity first appears 10 h posttreatment , coinciding with the beginning of the onset of peak c-jun mRNA expression .
AP-1 DNA binding activity then parallels c-jun expression , with a plateau between 10 and 48 h and a subsequent slow decline .
Thus , the time course of induction of DNA binding activity correlates with the onset of morphological differentiation in U-937 , with the first evidence of rare mature macrophages with pseudopods developing as early as 10 to 18 h after the onset of TPA treatment .
As noted before , morphological differentiation in response to TPA proceeds faster in HL-60 cells than in U-937 , and strong AP-1 DNA binding activity likewise develops earlier ( Fig .
5 ) .
Baseline AP-1 DNA binding activity appears to be somewhat higher in HL-60 than in U-937 cells , showing mild fluctuations from sample to sample .
However , AP-1 DNA binding activity is clearly induced within 4 h of TPA treatment and continues at a plateau until 30 h post-TPA , slowly declining thereafter .
Once again , the binding pattern parallels c-jun mRNA expression , but not c-fos or fra-1 mRNA expression , suggesting either that the cFos or Fra-1 proteins accumulate with very long half-lives or that other proteins are involved in the AP-1 complex .
TPA Induces Functional AP-1 Complexes during Differentiation .

c-fos - % Fra-1 GAD of jun and fos gene family members and the generation of AP-1 DNA binding activity during differentiation suggest that AP-1 has a role in this process , it is necessary to show that these transcriptional complexes are functional .
We chose to do this by demonstrating that TPA can enhance transcription from an AP-1 containing reporter construct transfected into U-937 and by examining the pattern of mRNA expression of endogenous genes known to have AP-1 sites in their promoters .
U-937 cells were transfected with Col-TREx5/TK CAT , a reporter construct containing five AP-1 sites linked to the thymidine kinase promoter and the CAT gene , and treated with 100 nm TPA for varying periods of time ( Fig .
6 ) .
Examination of untreated controls at each time point reveals minimal CAT activity , reflecting baseline transcriptional activation ( both AP-1 and non-AP-1 ) .
AP-1 transcriptional activation by TPA is clearly demonstrated between 10 and 72 h of TPA treatment , with a 3- to 6-fold increase in acetylated chloramphenicol forms .

Parallel transfections with TREA-72/TK CAT , a reporter construct identical to Col-TREx5/TK CAT except for a mutation in the AP-1 site ( thus abolishing AP-1 sensitivity ) , revealed that most of the TPA induced activity is specific for AP-1 .
These results correlate well with the AP-1 DNA binding assay in that transcriptional activation is demonstrated at the same time as DNA binding , suggesting that functional AP-1 - complexes - are , - indeed , - induced - during differentiation .
To confirm and expand these findings , we examined the expression of known AP-1 regulated endogenous genes .
It has previously been shown that metallothionein tla and vimentin have AP-1 sites in their promoters ( 20 , 27 , 28 ) .
If functioning AP-1 complexes are produced during TPA induced differentiation , then one would expect the expression of these genes to increase during differentiation .

Baseline mRNA levels of vimentin are substantial but rise significantly 24 h after TPA treatment .
Likewise , metallothionein mRNA levels ( which are low at baseline ) show a 7- to 8-fold induction by 48 h post-TPA .
In HL-60 , a similar pattern results , with both vimentin and metallothionein being induced within 10 h of TPA treatment ( results not shown ) .
Both of these patterns of mRNA expression follow the onset of AP-1 DNA binding activity , consistent with the functional action of AP-1 complexes induced by TPA .
Irreversibility of Differentiation Occurs after AP-1 Activity is Induced .
Having established a close correlation between AP-1 activity and differentiation , we wished to determine whether the process of differentiation becomes irreversible at a time when AP-1 is initially generated .
Since TPA is extremely lipophilic and can not be removed easily from growth medium by multiple washes , phorbol 12,1 3-dibutyrate , a water soluble member of the phorbol ester family , was used instead .
Morphological differentiation proceeds in an identical fashion under the influence of either phorbol ester in U-937 and HL-60 .
As shown in Fig .
8A , differentiation as measured by significant phagocytic capability ( the ability to ingest latex beads ) becomes irreversible between 10 and 18 h in U-937 , correlating with the time that AP-1 DNA binding activity and trans-activation ability measured by CAT TIME ( Hrs ) 0 1 4 assay are induced ( 10 h ) .
A similar pattern exists for HL-60 ( Fig .
8B ) .
This demonstrates that phorbol ester induced differentiation becomes irreversible only after functional AP-1 complexes are generated .
Discussion The above results suggest that the development of functional AP-1 complexes and subsequent regulation of AP-1 responsive genes are important events in TPA induced macrophage differentiation .
Several lines of evidence support this idea .
First , there is a tight correlation between AP-1 DNA binding activity and morphological differentiation .
AP-1 DNA binding activity first appears after 10 h of TPA treatment in U-937 , but after only 4 h in HL-60 .
This corresponds to the onset of morphological differentiation as evidenced by the first appearance of macrophage-like cells in both cell lines , providing a temporal link between the generation of AP-1 DNA binding activity and differentiation .
The second line of evidence is provided by functional analysis of these complexes .
Trans-activation , as measured by CAT assay , appears slightly sooner than AP-1 DNA binding activity ( 4 h versus 10 h } , but this reflects either differing sensitivities of the two assays or the fact that differentiation appears to proceed somewhat faster 72 TPA 7Comp Fig .

Nevertheless , by 10 h of TPA treatment ( when macrophage-like cells first appear ) , there is a 3- to 4-fold induction in CAT activity that increases to 5- to 6-fold by 18 h ( as more macrophage-like cells appear ) , demonstrating a tight correlation between morphological differentiation and the induction of CAT activity .
The third line of evidence linking AP-1 and differentiation is the demonstration that endogenous AP-1 regulated genes ( metallothionein lia and vimentin ) are induced during TPA induced differentiation with kinetics that differ in the two cell tines but parallel differentiation in both .
Fourthly , and perhaps most importantly , phorbol ester induced differentiation does not become irreversible until after functional AP-1 complexes are generated .

Metallothionein GAD 0 entiation , further implicating AP-1 in the differentiation process .
Evidence that AP-1 is not simply an end product of the cascade of terminal differentiation is supported by experiments with the biphenotypic nature of HL-60 cells .
We have shown that granulocytic differentiation in HL-60 by retinoic acid or DMSO is not accompanied by induction of c-jun .
On the other hand , treatment with vitamin D ; or bryostatin , both of which induce monocytic differentiation , induces c-jun ( 26 ) .
Thus , c-jun/AP-1 does not appear to have a generalized association with differentiation ( as does c-myc ) , but rather a more specific role in macrophage differentiation in particular .
A central question that is raised by the pattern of AP-1 DNA binding activity relates to the exact composition of the complex .
All jun and fos gene family members are capable of dimerizing with each other , thus creating a large number of possible combinations ( 29-31 ) .
In this study , c-jun mRNA expression best correlates with AP-1 DNA binding activity .
In U-937 , 10-h mRNA levels ( at which time AP-1 DNA binding is first detected ) are almost as high as the 24-h peak , and approximately 7- to 10-fold increased over baseline levels ( results not shown ) .
In HL-60 , 4-h c-jun mRNA levels ( when AP-1 DNA binding is first detected ) are over 20-fold increased over baseline levels .
Thus , AP-1 DNA binding activity appears in both cell lines once a threshold amount of c-jun mRNA is present .
Thereafter , c-jun remains elevated in both cell lines , paralleling AP-1 DNA binding .
The expression of other jun and fos gene family members studied does not correlate with AP-1 DNA binding activity as well as c-jun .
jun-B mRNA levels peak in U937 at 2 h and are clearly declining when peak AP-1 DNA binding activity is occurring , whereas in HL-60 the increased expression of jun-B substantially precedes AP-1 DNA binding activity .
Thus , although jun-B may well contribute to the AP-1 DNA binding activity detected , its pattern of expression suggests that it is not the major component .
Likewise , jun-D , c-fos , and fra-1 also peak early or in a pattern different from the generation of AP-1 .
c-fos mRNA is induced transiently by TPA , and although fra-1 mRNA peaks a bit later than c-fos , it too , is quickly down-regulated .

- irreversibility of differentiation by phorbol esters in U-937 and HL-60 .
Cells were treated with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate and then washed extensively to remove the phorbol ester at varying times .
Differentiation was assessed by the acquisition of phagocytic capability as measured by latex bead ingestion .
Cells were exposed to latex beads for 24 h before being counted .

gest that c-fos and fra-1 are less likely to be present in the AP-1 complex at 72 or 96 h post-TPA unless their individual protein products have dramatically prolonged half-lives .
Indeed , it has been shown that cFos can not be detected beyond 120 to 150 min of TPA treatment by immunoprecipitation in U-937 , despite detectable mRNA levels ( 32 ) .
This supports the finding that c-fos expression alone is neither sufficient nor necessary for TPA induced differentiation .
When HL-60 cells are treated with retinal ( to inhibit TPA activated protein kinase activity ) and TPA , c-fos induction is dramatically decreased , whereas differentiation is unimpeded ( 33 ) .
On the other hand , when HL-60 cells are treated with a synthetic analogue of diacylglycerol , 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol , differentiation does not occur , although c-fos mRNA induction occurs in a fashion similar to that seen with TPA ( 33 ) .
Thus , other members of the jun and fos gene families , some already known ( such as fra-2 or fos-B ) and others not yet discovered , may contribute to the AP-1 _ DNA - binding - activity - detected _ during differentiation .
Our results also shed light on the early events in TPA induced macrophage differentiation .
In U-937 , c-jun mRNA shows an early peak at 60 min followed by a slight decline and a second higher peak at 24 h. TPA has been shown to activate endogenous cJun , increasing the sequence specific binding to DNA ( 34 ) .
In addition , the promoter of c-jun contains an AP-1 site , which mediates positive feedback stimulation by AP-1 ( 34 ) .
Thus , the initial burst of c-jun mRNA activity in U-937 cells treated with TPA reflects the direct effects of TPA on baseline steady-state levels of endogenous cJun , resulting in autostimulation of the gene .
This is supported by the finding that in HL-60 , the early increase in c-jun mRNA does not require protein synthesis ( 26 ) .
The subsequent decline in c-jun mRNA between 60 min and 4 h occurs just after the peak of jun-B expression .
Results from other laboratories show that jun-B can function as a negative regulator of c-jun ( 35 , 36 ) .
The decline and the second peak of cjun mRNA expression may reflect both autostimulation by the newly translated cJun after TPA stimulation and negative regulation by JunB .
The pattern of c-jun expression in HL-60 appears somewhat different .
c-jun is rapidly stimulated after TPA treatment , presumably by a similar mechanism as in U-937 .
However , this increase occurs despite the simultaneous induction of jun-B .
These differences in c-jun regulation between U-937 and HL-60 may relate to the relative amounts of induced JunB or cJun or to differences that exist between the two cell lines in transcription cofactors which are necessary to mediate jun-B suppression of c-jun .
The model that thus emerges from this work is one where AP-1 and macrophage differentiation appear to be intimately connected .
AP-1 is generated by changes in the expression of multiple jun and fos gene family members induced by TPA .
The development and presence of AP-1 correlate closely with the process of differentiation .
Although it is unclear whether AP-1 is necessary or sufficient to promote terminal differentiation , the demonstration of the development of functional AP-1 activity is a first and necessary step in support of this possibility .
One would hypothesize that if AP-1 is truly critical in macrophage differentiation , then blocking or augmenting its action would dramatically alter this process .
Future studies will be needed to address these issues .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture .
The U-937 and HL-60 cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection and maintained in continuous culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm i-glutamine , 100 units/ml pen-icillin , 100 ug/ml streptomycin , and either 10 % ( U-937 ) or 20 % ( HL-60 ) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum .
For differentiation studies , 2.5 X 10° ( U-937 ) or 5 x 10° ( HL-60 ) cells were plated in 12 ml of growth media in 100-mm tissue culture dishes ( Costar ) 1 day prior to the addition of 100 nm TPA ( Sigma ) .
TPA was dissolved in acetone and stored at -20°C as a 1 mm stock solution .
Differentiation studies were also performed in HL-60 with 1 % DMSO ( Sigma ) or 1 um trans-retinoic acid ( Sigma ) in a similar fashion .
Retinoic acid was dissolved in 95 % ethanol and stored at -20°C as a 1 mm stock solution .
Irreversibility of differentiation studies were performed in the same manner , but using 250 nm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ( dissolved in DMSO and stored at -20°C as a 2.5 mm stock solution ; Sigma ) instead of TPA .
Cells were washed free of the phorbol ester at the appropriate time , and all cultures were then treated with polystyrene mon-odispersed 1.12-um latex beads ( Polysciences , Inc. ) at 48 h. Phagocytic activity as a measure of differentiation was Cell Growth & Differentiation 487 measured 24 h later by determining the percentage of cells with more than five latex beads internalized .
RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Hybridization .
Total cellular RNA was prepared by lysis in 4 m guanidine isothiocyanate and centrifugation through a cesium chloride gradient ( 37 ) .
The RNA was electrophoresed on formaldehyde gels ( 10 ug/lane ) and transferred to nitro-cellulose filters ( Schleicher & Schuell , Inc. ) , as previously described ( 38 ) .
The filters were hybridized with the desired *P-dCTP labeled probe prepared by the method of random priming ( 39 ) .
Filters were exposed to Kodak XAR or XRP film at -70°C with intensifying screens for variable periods of time .
Multiple hybridizations were performed on single blots without stripping .
Hybridizations were quantitated by densitometry using the GS300 scanning densitometer ( Hoefer Scientific Instruments ) .
DNA Binding Assays .
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Stein et al .
( 40 ) , with the following modifications .
Four 100-mm tissue culture dishes with either 2.5 x 10° ( U-937 ) or 5 x 10° ( HL-60 ) cells /plate were grown overnight prior to the addition of TPA .
Cells were harvested at the appropriate time after treatment by scraping with a rubber policeman and low speed centrifugation .
Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 40 ) , and incubated for 5 min on ice .
Nuclei were isolated by spinning at 2600 rpm at 4°C ( Sorvall RT6000B ) , washed once with lysis buffer without Noni-det P-40 , and resuspended in 30 to 50 ul of nuclear suspension buffer ( 40 ) .
Nuclei were then freeze thawed ( alternate immersion in dry ice-ethanol and 37°C baths ) for three cycles and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 x g , and the supernatant was immediately frozen on dry ice for further use for assays .
Extracts were stored at -135°C prior to use in DNA binding assays .
Protein concentrations were determined using a colorimetric protein assay system ( Bio-Rad ) .
DNA binding assays were performed using the GelShift Kit ( Stratagene ) , with the following modifications .
A 22-base pair AP-1 oligomer containing one AP-1 sequence was end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ P ] -ATP , and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation .
Forty thousand trichloroacetic acid precipitable cpm were used per reaction .
Gels were run at room temper-ature , dried overnight , and exposed to XAR or XRP film at -70°C for varying periods of time .
Transfections and CAT Assays .
DNA was introduced into U-937 cells by DEAE-dextran transfection as described previously ( 41 ) .
Briefly , cells were grown in quan-tity , and the medium was changed 1 day prior to trans-fection .
Approximately 1 x 10 `` cells/transfection were washed four times with RPMI 1640 and once with Tris buffered saline ( 25 mm Tris , pH 7.4-137 mm NaCl-5 mm KCI-0.7 mm CaCl ; -0.5 mm MgCl ; -0.6 mm Na ; HPO , ) .
Ten ug of plasmid DNA in 250 ul of TBS were mixed with 250 ul of 1 mg/ml DEAE-dextran ( Sigma ) in TBS , and the washed cells were resuspended in this mixture .
Cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then washed with TBS .
They were then washed once with RPMI 1640 and then resuspended in the growth medium that they had been growing in since the previous day to prevent fresh serum stimulation of AP-1 activity .
All transfections using the same DNA in a given experiment were mixed prior to incubation to equalize for differing transfection efficiencies .
Transfected cells were treated with TPA or acetone { control ) 18 to 24 h later and harvested for CAT assays at the appropriate time .
Protein concentrations were determined as described before .
CAT assays were performed as previously described using identical amounts of protein ( 40 to 50 ug ) per each reaction per experiment ( 42 ) .
The results of CAT assays were quantitated using the Betascope 603 blot analyzer ( Betagen ) .
Plasmids .
The following plasmids and restriction digest fragments were used for RNA hybridizations or transfec-tions : ( a ) a 1.1-kb cDNA of human c-jun ( 43 ) , ( b ) a 1.25-kb cDNA of human c-fos ( 44 ) , ( c ) a 1.2-kb cDNA of human jun-B ( 36 ) , ( d ) a 1.0-kb cDNA of murine jun-D ( 45 ) , ( e ) a 1.5-kb cDNA of rat fra-1 ( 10 ) , ( f ) a 1.26-kb cDNA of avian GAD ( 46 ) , ( g ) a 1.8-kb cDNA of human vimentin ( 47 ) , ( h ) a 3.3-kb product of HindIII digestion of human metallothionein lla cDNA , ( i ) a 1.3-kb product of EcoRI-Hind\Il digestion of human c-myc cDNA , ( j ) Col-TREx5/TK CAT ( 20 ) , ( k ) TREA-72/TK CAT ( 20 ) .
