Austria Summary Proliferative and secretory responses in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells are regulated by steroid and peptide hormones and by differentiation-promoting substances .
In the present study , we evaluated whether peripheral blood monocytes that exhibit anti-tumour activity in haematopoietic and solid tumours influence growth and secretion in the LNCaP cell line .
For this purpose , LNCaP cells were incubated with monocyte-conditioned medium ( MCM ) , and proliferation as well as expression of androgen receptor ( AR ) and secretion of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) were assessed .
Conditioned medium from monocytes reduced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner .
Incubation with 40 % MCM caused a 50 % reduction in cell proliferation .
AR protein decreased by 70 % and PSA levels in supematants from LNCaP cells were reduced by approximately 80 % following treatment with MCM .
We focused on the contribution of two major products of activated monocytes , prostaglandin E , and interleukin 16 ( IL-1B ) .
to the MCM modulatory action .
LNCaP cells treated with prostaglandin E , showed neither a reduction in proliferation nor a down-regulation of AR and PSA levels .
The effects of MCM on cellular proliferation , AR protein and PSA secretion were abolished by pretreatment of MCM with a neutralizing antibody .
In addition .
recombinant IL-1B was able to replace MCM for the inhibition of proliferation and down-regulation of AR and PSA proteins .
LNCaP cells were shown to express the IL-18 receptor type 1 , which transduces IL-1B signal .
Our findings reveal that monocyte-derived IL-1f inhibits the proliferation of androgen responsive prostate tumour cells and reduces AR and PSA levels .

is frequently used as a model for studying human prostate cancer ( Horoszewicz et al .
1983 ) .
It is known that steroid and peptide hormones as well as differentiation-promoting substances regulate proliferative and secretory responses in LNCaP cells .
The cells respond to androgen stimulation by accelerating division and producing prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) .
The pattems of andro-genic regulation of growth and secretory function in the LNCaP cell line are different ( Lee et al .
1995 ) .
The maximal growth rate is achieved at 0.1 nM of dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) .
whereas higher doses of this androgen induce growth arrest .
It was proposed that the inhibition of cellular proliferation by high androgen doses is mediated by transforming growth factor B ( TGF-B ) ( Kim et al .
1996 ) .
In contrast to the proliferative response .
the percentage of PSA-positive cells and the levels of PSA protein in LNCaP supernatants increase at concentrations of 1 nM dihydrotestosterone and beyond ( Lee et al .
1995 ) .
In addition to androgens .
polypeptide growth factors such as epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) .
TGF-a .
insulin-like growth factors and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) are mitogenic for LNCaP cells ( Wilding et al .

LNCaP cells express a mutant androgen receptor ( AR ) .
which binds oestrogenic and progestagenic steroids and non-steroidal anti-androgens hydroxyflutamide and nilutamide with higher affinity than the wild-type AR .
These substances induce reporter gene activity in the presence of LNCaP AR more efficiently than in the presence of the wild-type AR ( Veldscholte et al .
1990 ) .
Studies on interactions between leucocytes that produce various cytokines and differentiation factors and prostate tumour cells may improve understanding of prostate cancer biology .
In one of the initial studies in this field Hsieh et al ( 1995 ) have shown that phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) -stimulated lymphocytes produce substance ( s ) that reduce cell proliferation .
increase expression of cytoskeleton proteins and down-regulate AR and PSA in LNCaP cells .
These effects were observed after treatment with various concentrations of T-lymphocyte-conditioned media ( TCM ) .
However .
the T-cell-derived factor ( s ) that mediate these effects have so far not been identified .
Interactions between other cells of the immune system and various tumours have been described ( Wang et al .
1996 ; Iversen et al .
1997 ) .
For example .
monocytes were found to suppress cell viability and colony formation in human leukaemias and lung tumours .
In this study .
we address the issue of whether peripheral blood monocytes influence growth and secretion in androgen-responsive prostatic epithelial cells .
We show that monocyte-derived interleukin 1 ( IL-1 B ) is a mediator of the modulatory effects on LNCaP cells .

LNCaP cells were exposed to medium conditioned by peripheral blood monocytes homogenously positive for CD14 ( Figure 1A ) .
Distinct morphological changes in LNCaP cells were observed after treatment with monocyte-conditioned medium ( MCM ) .
The cells became elongated and showed dendrite-like processes .
which were connected to each other ( Figure 2 ) .
These morphological changes were notable even with 10 % MCM in LNCaP culture medium .
Expression of cytoskeletal proteins was evaluated by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry .
A monoclonal antibody directed against luminal cytokeratins 8 and 18 was used for this purpose .
The expression and staining intensity of these cytokeratins were previously reported to increase in the more differentiated prostatic luminal epithelium ( PeehI et al .
1993 ) .
In the case of LNCaP cells treated with MCM .
we observed neither an increase in the percentage of cytokeratin-immunopositive cells nor a change in staining intensity .

After this period , cellular growth was assessed by means of the MTT assay .
Conditioned medium from PHA-M-activated monocytes reduced cellular proliferation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3 ) .
MCM at 40 % reduced proliferation by 50 % .
Higher concentrations of MCM in culture media did not result in any further reduction in cell number .
PHA-M itself did not display any effect on the proliferation of LNCaP cells .
Conditioned medium from monocytes that were not treated with PHA-M induced a similar decrease in cell proliferation ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it seems that the presence of PHA in monocyte cultures is not required for inhibition of growth of LNCaP cells .
The proliferative effect of 0.01 nm of R1881 was abolished by 40 % MCM ( Figure 3 ) .

A decrease in PSA was observed in the presence of 20-40 % of MCM in culture media .
PSA protein was reduced by 80 % with 40 % MCM .
MCM also antagonized stimulatory effects of the synthetic androgen R1881 on PSA secretion into the super-natant ( Figure 5 ) .
IL-1§ is responsible for the modulatory effects of MCM We focused on the contribution of individual factors to the MCM modulatory effects .
Initially , we investigated the role of prostaglandin E , , which is a major product of activated monocytes ( Venkataprasad et al , 1996 ) .
LNCaP cells treated with prostaglandin E , showed neither a reduction in proliferation nor a down-regulation of AR and PSA levels .
Thus , prostaglandin E , can be excluded as a mediator of the inhibitory effects of monocytes on androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells .
Next , we examined the role of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 } , which exhibits anti-tumour activity in several models ( Kilian et al , 1991 ; Braunschweiger et al , 1996 ) , in the interaction between the immune system and prostate cancer cells .
In order to determine whether IL-1 B mediates MCM effects on LNCaP cells , MCM was preincubated with a neutralizing polyclonal anti-IL-1f } antibody .
The effectiveness of this antibody was previously demonstrated in other assay systems ( Salem et al , 1990 ; Lisak and Bealmear , 1991 ) .
MCM pretreated with the antibody did not reduce LNCaP cell proliferation ( Figure 6A ) .
The MCM effect on AR protein was completely abolished after preincubation of MCM with the polyclonal anti-IL-1B antibody ( Figure 6B ) , and the PSA levels were almost completely restored ( Figure 6C ) .
Moreover , addition of recombinant IL-1f } to cultures of LNCaP cells exerted effects that British Journal of Cancer ( 1998 ) 78 ( 8 ) , 1004-1011 1008 Z Culig et al 15 = PSA ( ng UA ' ) p3 o < Pe 6 a 30 % MCM 40 % MCM 0.01 nm R1881 0.01 nm R1881+ 40 % MCM 0.1 nm R1881 0.1 nm R1881+ 40 % MCM Figure 5 - Regulation of PSA secretion in LNCaP cells by MCM .

Cell proliferation was reduced dose dependently ( Figure 6A ) .
the AR protein levels decreased ( Figure 6D ) and PSA secretion was diminished ( Figure 6C ) .
Finally .
LNCaP cells were shown to express the IL-1B receptor type I ( Figure 1B ) .
which transduces IL-1 $ signal ( Curtis et al .
1989 ) .
DISCUSSION The major finding of the present study is that peripheral blood monocytes are capable of modulating cellular events in androgen-responsive LNCaP cells by secreting IL-1B .
This ability of monocytes is similar to that previously reported for T lymphocytes in the same cell line ( Hsieh et al .
1995 ) .
Both cell types secrete substances that cause a reduction in cellular proliferation .
diminish levels of AR protein and down-regulate PSA in LNCaP cells .
In our experiments .
MCM was effective regardless of the presence of PHA in monocyte cultures .
In contrast .
unstimulated lymphocytes provoked only a minimal growth inhibition of LNCaP cells ( Hsieh et al .
1995 ) .
LNCaP cells became elongated and exhibited dendrite-like processes after contact with MCM and TCM .
Similar changes in cell shape were described after treatment of LNCaP cells with analogues of cAMP ( Bang et al .
1994 ) .
There was .
however .
one difference between MCM- and TCM-treated LNCaP cells .
The expression of cytokeratins 8 and 18 and their staining intensity increased twofold after incubation with TCM as determined by a total intensity score procedure ( Hsieh et al .
1995 ) .
In the case of MCM we did not see any differences in the expression of these British Journal of Cancer ( 1998 ) 78 ( 8 ) .
1004-1011 cytoskeleton proteins by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry .
Contrasting results on expression of cytokeratins may be due to use of different antibodies and immunohistochemical techniques .
It was suggested by others that TCM- and cAMP analogue-treated LNCaP cells undergo neuroendocrine differentiation ( Bang et al .
1994 ; Hsieh et al .
1995 ) .
TCM treatment provoked an increase in total intensity score of two neuroendocrine markers .
neuron-specific enolase and serotonin .
However .
the concept of neuroendocrine differentiation of this cell line was questioned recently ( Noordzij et al .
1996 ) .
In that publication and in our previous experimental studies neuroendocrine cells within the LNCaP cell line were not identified ( unpublished data ) .
Thus .
a differentiation process induced by leucocytes in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells is not well characterized to date .
The MCM-induced growth-inhibitory effect was associated with decreased AR expression .
Association between AR expression and growth regulation of prostate cancer cells can be studied in AR-positive LNCaP cells and in AR cDNA-transfected PC-3 cells .
It was demonstrated that the expression of AR in PC-3 cells leads to a decrease in proliferation ( Yuan et al .
1993 ) .
We infer that more reliable information on AR involvement in growth regulation may be obtained in its natural cellular environment .
i.e .
in LNCaP cells .
Growth inhibition and AR reduction were previously observed in LNCaP cells incubated with retinoic acid and TCM ( Young et al .
1994 ; Hsieh et al .
1995 ) .
Regarding AR expression .
conditioned media from T lymphocytes and monocytes .
and retinoic acid differ from anti-androgens cyproterone acetate .
hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide .
which are commonly used in endocrine therapy for prostate cancer .
These compounds bind to the AR with low affinity and do not permit acquisition of a tran-scriptionally active form of the receptor ( Kemppainen et al .
1992 ; Kallio et al .
1994 ) .
However .
they did not down-regulate AR protein itself .
AR is expressed in relapsed prostate tumours and in their metastases .
which were obtained before onset of therapy and durning tumour progression ( van der Kwast et al .
1991 ; Hobisch et al .
1995 .
1996 ) .
Several recent publications support the view that reduction in androgen concentration is not sufficient to prevent transmission of extracellular signals via the AR ( Veldscholte et al .
1990 ; Culig et al .
1993 .
1994 ; Kokontis et al .
1994 ; Nazareth and Weigel .
1996 ) .
Prostate cancer cells may adapt to an environment with very low androgen concentration by increasing their AR expression and transcriptional activity ( Kokontis et al .
1994 ) .
Furthermore .
mutant ARs discovered in prostate cancer frequently exhibit a gain in function : they are efficiently activated by other steroids and non-steroidal AR antagonists ( Veldscholte et al .
1990 : Culig et al .
1993 ) .
Finally .
AR activity is up-regulated by several non-steroidal substances such as polypeptide growth factors and second messengers ( Culig et al .
1994 ; Nazareth and Weigel .
1996 ) .
Therefore .
strategies aimed at reducing AR levels .
such as administration of secretory products from the immune cells .
may be beneficial in metastatic prostate cancer .
AR down-regulation was followed by reduction of PSA protein in LNCaP supernatants .
Thus .
the effect of MCM is different to that of phenvlacetate and vitamin D. substances that have been reported to inhibit proliferation of LNCaP cells and increase PSA secretion ( Walls et al .
1996 : Zhao et al .
1997 ) .
The mediator role of IL-1 B was revealed in experiments in which the neutralizing anti-IL-1B antibody abolished the effects of MCM .
Furthermore .
IL-1 itself exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition on LNCaP proliferation .
AR protein level and PSA secretion .
In contrast to our findings with MCM .

1995 ) .
However .
our results with regard to AR binding differ from those of Hsieh and Chiao .
These authors failed to show a negative effect on AR protein levels after IL-1 & treatment .
Ritchie et al ( 1997 ) also treated LNCaP cells and androgen-independent PC-3 and DU-145 cells with increasing concentrations of IL-1B .
Supplementation of prostate cell cultures with IL-1B caused a decreased proliferation of all three cell lines .
However .
the negative effect of IL-1f on proliferation was far more pronounced in LNCaP cells than in the two androgen-independent cell lines .
Although determination of AR protein was not performed in that study .
a marked effect in LNCaP cells suggests an interaction between IL-1 B and AR pathways .
IL-1 B also decreased cell chemo-taxis in the three prostate cancer cell lines ( Ritchie et al .
1997 ) .
Interestingly .
inhibition of growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by IL-1 is associated with down-regulation of oestrogen receptor ( Danforth and Sgagias .
1991 ) .
A different type of interaction between monocytes and LNCaP cells was recently reported ( Klein et al .
1997 ) .
Expression of matrilysin .
which is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase superfamily .
in LNCaP cells is induced by conditioned medium from the monocytic cell line THP-1 .
In addition .
recombinant IL-1 up-regulated - matrilysin expression .
Biological neutralization experiments revealed that the effect of THP-1 conditioned medium was abolished by an anti-IL- 1 B antibody .
and it was concluded that IL-1 f is a mediator of matrilysin induction .
This up-regulation of matrilysin by IL-1 may be harmful in prostate cancer .
It was shown that matrilysin-transfected prostate cancer cells have a high invasive potential in immunodeficient mice ( Powell et al .
1993 ) .
IL-1 } activates several second-messenger systems in target tissues ( Munoz et al .
1990 ; Roberts et al .
1992 : Carman-Krzan and Wise .
1993 ; Cole et al .
1995 : Sjoholm 1995 ) .
For example .
IL- 1B induces cAMP in human decidual cells .
It stimulates secretion of nerve growth factor in astroglial cultures by activation of the phospholipase A2-lipoxygenase pathway .
In pancreatic B-cells ceramide may be involved in transducing the cytotoxic and cyto-static actions of IL-1B .
Involvement of protein kinase C and nitric oxide pathways in IL-1B signalling was also described .
It remains to be determined in future studies which of these signalling pathways may be operative in prostatic epithelial cells .
In summary .
this study demonstrates that the monocyte secretory product IL-1 } is a potentially important negative regulator in LNCaP cells .
Therapeutic application of this pleiotropic cytokine in prostate cancer will probably be further explored .
