Retinoic Acid Inhibits CD40 + Interleukin-4-Mediated IgE Production In Vitro By M. Worm , J.M .
Krah , R.A. Manz , and B.M .
Henz To elucidate the role of retinoic acid ( RA ) in anti-CD40 + interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) -mediated B-cell activation , the effect of 10-2 to 10- `` mol/L RA was studied in anti-CD40 ( 1 pg/mL ) + IL-4 ( 5 ng/mL ) -mediated proliferation and Ig synthesis by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and B cells in healthy donors .
Anti-CD40 + IL-4-mediated proliferation of PBMC and B cells was inhibited by RA in a dose-dependent manner , with maximal inhibition of 62 % + 5 % in PBMC and 55 % + 4.4 % in B cells by all-frans RA , and 58 % + 6.7 % and 51 % + 4.7 % , respectively by 13-cis RA .
IgE synthesis was even more markedly inhibited by RA starting at concentrations of > 10- !
4 mol/ L for B cells and > 10- ! ``
mol/L for PBMC .
Maximal inhibition of IgE production for B cells was at 10-° mol/ L for all-trans RA ( 94 % + 1.8 % ) and 96 % + 3.2 % for 13-cis RA .
Low concentrations of RA inhibiting IgE synthesis ( 10-'° mol/L ) affected neither B-cell proliferation nor the production of IgA , IgG , and IgM .
Elucidation of the ETINOIDS ARE DERIVED from vitamin A and are widely used in the treatment of dermatologic disorders such as acne and psoriasis .
!
Their biologic effects include the regulation of growth and differentiation in a number of cell types primarily of epithelial bone marrow origin .
Recently , retinol and retinoic acid ( RA ) have also been shown to inhibit proliferation of isolated mature and precursor B cells from normal donors after mitogenic stimulation . ``
The role of RA on CD40 + interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) -mediated IgE synthesis has , however , not yet been studied .
Stimulation of human B cells by anti-CD40 + IL-4 results in proliferation and IgE production .
`` * Class switching factors such as IL-4 induce expression of the germline transcript of the Ce gene , which maintains an open chromatin structure in this region .
The activation of CD40 results in the induction of the class switching machinery for S-S recombination . ``
Interaction between CD40 on B cells and CD4OL on T cells is critical for T-cell-dependent isotype switching , because it has been shown that disruption of the CD4OL gene causes X-chromosome-linked immune deficiency , characterized by decreased serum IgA , IgG and IgE levels . ``
Anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ) mimic the effect of €CD4O0L and anti-CD40 MoAb plus IL-4 induce IgE production in vitro .
CD40 + IL-4-mediated IgE production can be inhibited by various cytokines including interferon-y ( IFN-y ) , IL-8 , IL-10 , and IL-12 and by various other factors such as hormones .
`` > In search of molecules that might induce a therapeutic downregulation of IgE synthesis , which is considered to be a basic effect in atopic diseases , we have chosen here to study the effects of RA on CD40 + IL-4-mediated B-cell activation including IgE production .
The present data show for the first time that RA induces a dose-dependent , selective inhibition of CD40 + IL-4-mediated proliferation and even more reduction of IgE production by human peripheral B lymphocytes , with the latter acting at the level of epsilon germline transcription most likely via retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) a .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
- Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were isolated from buffy coats of nonallergic healthy donors by ficoll hypaque Blood , Vol 92 , No 5 ( September 1 ) , 1998 : pp 1713-1720 mechanism involved in this inhibition of IgE production shows that epsilon germline transcription is decreased by RA , whereas production of interferon-y ( IFN-y ) was not enhanced in the presence of RA .
To differentiate w hether the RA effect was mediated by RA receptors « , B , and y , the expression of the retinoic acid receptors ( RAR ) was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCB ) .
The data show that unstimulated human peripheral B cells express mRNA of the RA receptor « , B , and y .
Using retinoids with different receptor binding specificity ( CD336 , CD437 , CD2019 , CD367 ) , dose-dependent inhibition of IgE synthesis was shown by all four derivates , but was most marked by an RA binding the « receptor with high specificity .
Taken together , this study shows that RA inhibits IgE production of anti-CD40 + IL-4-stimulated B cells in vitro .

separation ( 1,400 rpm , 30 minutes , room temperature ) .
B cells were purified using anti-CD19-coupled magnetic beads ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) .
Briefly , cells and antibody-conjugated beads ( 1:5 ratio ) were incubated for 1 hour on ice , then CD19-positive B cells were selected by magnetic separation and after several washings the cells were resus-pended in medium and cultured overnight at 37°C .
The next morning , cells were separated from the beads by several washings and counted .
The purified cell population contained more than 95 % B cells , as assessed by immunofluorescence with anti-CD20 antibody .
In previous studies , this procedure has been shown not to activate B cells .

CD19/IgM double-positive PBMC were sorted according to the instructions of the manufacturer ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch-Gladbach , Germany ) by magnetic cell sorting ( MACS ) with the CD19 Multi Sort Kit .
Briefly , PBMC were enriched using anti-CD19 magnetic beads in combination with a VS separation column .
After release of the magnetic label , CD19 positive cells were sorted according to the expression of IgM ( VS separation column ) .
All reagents were obtained from Miltenyi Biotec .
For fluorescent staining 10° cells were suspended in 90 uL staining buffer ( 2 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] in phosphate-buffered saline [ PBS ] , pH 7.4 , 0.1 % sodium azide ) with 10 uL of the appropiate antibody and incubated for 30 minutes on ice .
After several washings , cells were fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde , when the biotinylated MoAb was used , cells were incubated for another 30 minutes with streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin ( PE ) before fixation .
Cells ( 10° cells/well ) were cultured for 3 days for proliferation and 10 days for IgE assays .

RESULTS RA inhibits CD40 + IL-4-mediated cell proliferation .
To study the role of RA in CD40 + IL-4-mediated cell activation , we used different concentrations of all-trans RA and its 13-cis isomer ( 10- ' to 10-° mol/L ) in the presence of anti-CD40 + IL-4 .
A dose-dependent inhibition with both RA derivates of CD40 + IL-4-mediated PBMC proliferation was observed .
For quantification of the antiproliferative effect on CD40 + IL-4-stimulated cells , mean values of stimulated cells were set at 100 % .
A 62 % + 5.2 % maximal inhibition of PBMC proliferation was observed at 10~- `` mol/L by all trans retinoic acid and a 58 % + 6.3 % maximal inhibition by 10 mol/L 13-cis retinoic acid ( Fig 1A ) .
Because the inhibition of CD40 + IL-4-mediated cell proliferation might be mediated either through direct effects on B cells or through indirect effects , eg , via increased cytokine production by cells other than B cells , we examined next the effects of all-trans and 13-cis RA on CD40 + IL-4-mediated B-cell proliferation .
The pattern of inhibition with B cells was comparable to that observed with PBMC , with a 55 % * 4.4 % maximal inhibition of CD40 + IL-4-mediated B-cell proliferation for all-trans RA and 51 + 4.7 for 13-cis RA , both at 10-8 Table 2 .

RA inhibits CD40 + IL-4-mediated IgE .
, production .
Because stimulation of B cells with anti-CD40 + IL-4 results not only in proliferation , but also in IgE production , we examined the effects of RA on CD40 + IL-4-mediated IgE-synthesis .
Figure 2 shows that in the presence of all-trans and 13-cis RA , CD40 + IL-4-mediated IgE production was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in both PBMC and CD19+ B cells .
In PBMC , maximal inhibition of IgE was 81 % + 8 % for all-trans RA and 82 % + 11.4 % for 13-cis RA , both at 10 mol/L ( Fig 2A ) , and with B cells , inhibition of IgE production even reached control levels of 94 % + 1.8 % and 96 % + 3.2 % , respectively , at 10-8 mol/L ( Fig 2B ) .
Interestingly , inhibition of IgE production in the B cells was observed already at very low concentrations of RA ( 10-4 mol/L ) , indicating a specific effect on IgE production rather than on inhibition of cell proliferation .
To provide further evidence that RA is not just affecting the synthesis of IgE from previously switched B cells , we used double separated CD19-IgM* cells ( Fig 3 ) .
The data show ( Table 1 ) that inhibition of IgE synthesis after anti-€CD40 + IL-4 stimulation by all-trans and 13-cis RA was also observed in double-purified CD19-IgM* B cells .
RA does not affect IgA and IgG production .
To determine whether the inhibition of IgE production was accompanied by inhibition of the production of other Igs , we measured the production of IgA , IgG , and IgM in the supernatants of CD40 + IL-4-stimulated CD19* cells .
As shown in Fig 4 , all-trans and 13-cis RA had hardly any effect on IgA or IgG production .
RA concentrations with greater than 50 % inhibition of IgE production failed to affect IgA or IgG production indicating a more Table 3 .

selective effect of RA on IgE production .
This finding was further confirmed by using CD19-IgM+* B cells in which induction of IgA and IgG production after stimulation with anti-CD40 + IL-4 was detected and , which was not inhibitd in the presence of all-trans or 13-cis RA ( Table 1 ) .
Because stimulation of B cells with anti-CD40 + IL-4 results not only in IgE , but also IgM production , we also examined the effects of all-trans and 13-cis RA on anti-CD40 + IL-4-induced IgM production .
All-frans RA caused a modest inhibition of IgM production in CD40 + IL-4-stimulated B cells , whereas 13-cis RA resulted in a more marked dose-dependent inhibition of IgM production ( Fig 4 ) , but only at higher RA concentrations ( 10~° and 10-8 ) .
However , the maximal inhibition of IgM production was significantly lower compared with the inhibition of IgE production .
RA inhibits epsilon germline transcription .
Production of epsilon germline transcription is a prerequisite for the isotype switching to IgE . ``
To examine whether RA-mediated inhibition of IgE production occurs directly at this level , we studied the expression of germline Ce transcripts semiquantitatively by RT-PCR .
The specificity of the germline transcripts was confirmed by obtaining PCR products of the expected molecular size , by its expression pattern , and by direct partial sequencing .
A representative result of three experiments is shown in Fig 5 .
As a control , GAPDH expression was assessed for equal amounts of cDNA .
Levels of epsilon germline transcription were increased after stimulation with anti-CD40 + IL4 for 4 days .
In the presence of both RA derivates ( all-trans and 13-cis RA ) , a dose-dependent inhibition of epsilon germline transcription was observed ( shown for all-frans-RA in Fig 5 ) .
In agreement with the inhibition of IgE levels at RA concentrations tested ( Fig 2 ) , there was a marked inhibition of epsilon germline transcription at 10- !
° mol/L of all-trans RA , as assessed by semiquantitative evaluation .
This indicates that RA inhibits IgE production affecting epsilon germline transcription in CD40 + IL-4-stimulated B cells .
Inhibition of IgE production is IFN-y independent .
To explore possible mechanisms involved in RA-induced inhibition of epsilon germline transcription and because IFN-y is known to inhibit IgE production , '* we examined next whether the production of this cytokine is increased in the presence of RA .
PBMC and B cells from normal donors were stimulated with anti-CD40 + IL-4 alone or in the presence of RA .

Experiments were performed as described in Fig 2 .

cells is low and highly variable .
In the presence of both RA , the DISCUSSION amounts of IFN-y were rather decreased in the supernatants of CD40 + IL-4-stimulated PBMC and B cells .
However , neither all-trans nor 13-cis RA significantly enhanced the production of IFN-y , indicating that inhibition of IgE synthesis by both RA derivatives involves mechanisms other than IFN-y .
Expression of retinoic acid receptors on human B cells .
The biological effects of RA are exerted through binding the RARa , B , and y .
To determine the expression of the different RAR in unstimulated peripheral B cells , semiquantitative PCR analysis was performed by using RARa « , B , and y specific primers .
Transcripts for the RARa , B , and y , were detectable in unstimulated peripheral human B cells by RT-PCR ( Fig 6 ) .
As a positive control , primers for RARa , B , and y were used in a monocytic cell line ( THP-1 ) , which has been shown to express all three RAR ( M. Babina , personal communication , November 1997 ) .
Effects of receptor-specific retinoids on CD40 + IL-4-mediated IgE .
production .
The role of the different RAR during IgE production was determined next by using derivates of RA with different affinity toward the RARa , B , and y .
The molecular weights , their receptor specificity and their transcriptional activation values after binding the particular receptor indicating the intracellular activity of the four retinoids studied are summarized in Table 3 .
As shown in Table 4 , all compounds were inhibitory , but those binding RARa « with high-affinity did so by greater than 80 % at concentrations of > 10~ `` ' mol/L .
These findings were further confirmed by the observation that e germline transcription of CD40 + IL-4-stimulated cells was only inhibited at concentrations above 10~ ' mol/L in the presence of CD336 and CD367 , derivates of RA with high affinity toward the RARa ( data not shown ) .
Analysis of IgA , IgG , and IgM production in the presence of the RAR-specific compounds showed that the production of these Igs was not altered ( Table 1 , Fig 7 ) , confirming the specificity by which RA inhibits €D40 + IL-4-mediated IgE production .
In the present report , we demonstrate that all-trans and 13-cis RA affects CD40 + IL-4-mediated B-cell activation by inhibition of B-cell proliferation and IgE synthesis .
Using RAR-specific RA derivates , we elucidated that these effects are primarily mediated via the nuclear RARa « .
Because the physi-ologic level of all-trans RA in serum is about 10 nmol/L `` and because the inhibition of DNA synthesis elicited by all-trans-RA at this concentration was 50 % in PBMC and 58 % in B cells after CD40 + IL-4 stimulation and because IgE synthesis was even affected at a concentration of 10-'* mol/L in B cells and 10-'° mol/L in PBMC , marked inhibition of B-cell proliferation and of IgE production must be assumed to be achievable during oral treatment with RA .
! ``
Presumably due to the importance of retinoids in the treatment of hematologic and dermatologic disorders such as leukemia , acne , or psoriasis , the focus of past studies has been on the role of retinoids in the growth and differentiation of myeloid cells and keratinocytes . ``
However , vitamin A has been shown to be a key regulator for cell growth , cytokine production , and differentiation in normal B cells . ``
'' `` `` The growth inhibiting effects of retinoids on B lymphoid cells have been noticed previously using cell lines at different stages of maturation . ``
Despite the dramatic effects of vitamin A deficiency on the immune system in vivo , `` and the role of RA on B-cell growth and differentiation in vitro , ' `` `` `` no information about the effects of RA on CD40 + IL-4-mediated isotype switching and Ig synthesis in human B cells is available .
The majority of in vivo experiments dealing with vitamin A and the immune system have concluded that vitamin A has a stimulatory role on cells of the immune system . ``
'' This assumption is based on deficiency studies in animal models , epidemio-logic data from humans , as well as data on supplementation of retinoids showing reduced infections in humans .
In vitro experiments using isolated lymphocytes have shown divergent From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

RETINOIC ACID AND B CELLS effects .
Both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of retinoids on B lymphocytes have been observed . '
'' `` 2 However , more recent studies have clearly shown that RA inhibits mitogenic activation of human and murine B cells , `` in line with the present results .
Induction of IgE synthesis requires two signals and has been shown to be induced by the cytokine IL-4 and engagement of the B-cell antigen CD40 .
No data about the role of RA in CD40 + IL-4-mediated IgE production are available to date .
However , in a previous study using an in vivo mouse model , an increased IgE response after ovalbumin ( OvA ) sensitization has been demonstrated in RA-pretreated mice . ``
'' In contrast to these findings , we show here that CD40 + IL-4-mediated IgE production is strongly inhibited by RA in a dose-dependent manner .
Inhibition of IgE synthesis occurs at very low concentrations ( down to 10- ' mol/L ) , which are easily achieved in the serum during retinoid treatment .
The observation that while , in cultures of purified B cells , the concentration of RA required for inhibition of IgE synthesis is substantially lower than for proliferation is not the case in PBMC , suggests that additional factors , eg , cytokines other than IFN-y , may prevent the RA susceptibility of IgE synthesis .
Inhibition of in vitro IgE production has also been reported with all-trans RA by Tokuyama et al `` in the murine system .
These investigators used IL-4 + hydrocortisone-stimulated splenic B cells from mice and detected a dose-dependent inhibition of IgE production in the presence of RA .
We show here for the first time an inhibition of CD40 + IL-4-induced IgE production in human peripheral B cells .
Furthermore , we demonstrate inhibition of epsilon germline transcription by RA suggesting thus a molecular mechanism of RA dependent inhibition of IgE production .
Epsilon germline transcription is a prerequisite for the induction of IgE isotype switching , because deletion of the I exon in mice results in significant impairment of IgE production . ``
'' Therefore , inhibition of epsilon germline transcription by RA may play an important role in the regulation of IgE production after €D40 + IL-4 stimulation in vivo .
That RA is capable of affecting Ig production in mice has been shown in other studies .
The effects of RA on B cells seems to depend on the model or the type of stimulation used since in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated splenic B cells , enhancement of germline C a transcripts was determined , while on the other hand , IL-4-induced I y expression was completely abolished in the presence of RA . ``
Taken together , the currently available data strongly support the concept that RA is capable of modulating Ig production significantly even at the level of isotype switching .
However , this does not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms are operative in addition , possibly via the action of cytokines .
A variety of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-e ( TNF-a ) , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 , and transforming growth factor- ( TGE-B ) have been shown to modulate IgE production . ``
'' Because IFN-y has been shown to inhibit IgE production , `` `` we studied the production of IFN-y in the presence of RA .
The lack of any enhancing effects of RA on the production of IFN-y suggests that inhibition of IgE production is IFN-y independent .
The observation that IgE synthesis in B cells was more inhibited than in PBMC where IFN-y production is produced by monocytes or TH1 cells also speaks against 1719 a role of IFN-y in the in vitro data observed with RA .
Another cytokine that may be involved in the inhibition of IgE-production by RA is TGF-B .
This cytokine has been shown to be induced by RA in keratinocytes . ``
TGF-B is a potent immunosuppressive cytokine and has also been shown to inhibit IgE and epsilon germline transcription in vitro . ``
'' Whether TGF-B production is increased in the presence of RA in PBMC or B cells is currently under investigation .
However , a study by Tokuyama et al `` has shown a TGF-f independent modulation of germline transcription in LPS/IL-4-stimulated mouse B cells .
At the molecular level , retinoids bind to and activate specific nuclear receptors , the RARs and retinoic X receptors ( RXRs ) .
These recognize specific DNA sequences as homo- or heterodimers , which in turn , bind specific DNA sequences regulating gene expression . ``
Whether RA binding proteins can directly interact with the epsilon germline promoter region is an interesting possibility that will have to be explored in future studies .
