10 The Ability of BHRF1 To Inhibit Apoptosis Is Dependent on Stimulus and Cell Type LASSE FOGHSGAARD anp MARJA JAATTELA* Apoptosis Laboratory , Division for Cancer Biology , Danish Cancer Society , DK-2100 Copenhagen , Denmark Received 14 May 1997/Accepted 16 July 1997 The development of resistance to host defense mechanisms such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - and Fas-mediated apoptosis of transformed or virus-infected cells may be a critical component in the development of disease .
To find genes that protect cells from apoptosis , we used an expression cloning strategy and identified BHRF1 , an Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) early-lytic-cycle protein with distant homology to Bcl-2 , as an antiapoptosis protein .
Expression of BHRF1 in MCF-Fas cells conferred nearly complete resistance against both anti-Fas antibody and TNF-mediated apoptosis .
In addition , BHRF1 protected these cells from monocyte-mediated killing but failed to protect them from killing mediated by lymphokine-activated killer cells .
The ability of BHRF1 to protect MCF-Fas cells from apoptosis induced by various stimuli was identical to that of Bel-2 and Bcel-x , .
Moreover , the mechanism of action of BHRF1 resembled that of Bel-2 and Bel-x , , as it inhibited TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway , cytosolic phospholipase A , and caspase-3/CPP32 , but did not interfere with the activation of NF-B-like transcription factors .
A putative function of BHRF1 in EBV-infected epithelial cells may be to protect virus-infected cells from TNF- and/or anti-Fas-induced cell death in order to maximize virus production .
Surprisingly , expression of neither BHRF1 nor Bel-2 in a B-cell line , BJAB , protected the cells from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis even though they increased the survival of serum-starved cells .
Thus , the protective role of BHRF1 against apoptosis resembles that of Bcl-2 in being cell type specific and dependent on the apoptotic stimulus .
Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) is a multifunctional cytokine capable of inducing apoptosis in a number of transformed or virus-infected cells ( 10 , 18 , 44 ) .
The pleiotropic effects of TNF are mediated by two distinct but structurally related cell surface receptors , TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 ( 47 , 51 ) .
TNF receptors are members of a larger family of related membrane proteins which are defined by the presence of extracellular cysteine-rich repeats ( 40 ) .
Two members of this so-called TNF receptor superfamily , TNF-R1 and Fas ( APO1/CD95 ) , also share a region of intracellular homology designated the `` death domain `` ( 15 , 46 ) .
This domain is an essential component of the signal pathway that triggers apoptosis .
Fas ligand ( FasL ) is expressed predominantly in activated T cells and shows strong cytotoxic activity against Fas-expressing cells ( 43 ) .
FasL , like TNF , has antiviral activity and is also involved in the downregulation of immune responses ( 31 ) .
Like other apoptotic stimuli , signaling from TNF and FasL converges into a common cell death pathway ( for a review , see reference 30 ) .
This common pathway is tightly regulated by intracellular decision points ( 34 ) .
One is constituted by the Bcl-2 family of proteins , which is comprised of positive and negative regulators of cell death ( for a review , see reference 57 ) .
The different members share three Bel-2 homology domains ( BH1 , BH2 , and BH3 ) which enable the proteins to homo- or heterodimerize , and the ratio of death antagonists ( Bel-2 , Bel-x , , Mecl-1 , and A1 ) to death agonists ( Bax , Bak , Bel-xg , and Bad ) dictates whether a cell will respond to apoptotic stimuli ( 57 ) .
The new and growing family of caspases , cysteine proteases related to interleukin-1B-converting enzyme ( ICE/caspase-1 ) , are activated in apoptosis and are now recognized as major * Corresponding author .

7509 effectors of apoptotic cell death ( for a review , see reference 33 ) .
The importance of caspases in TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptosis has been clearly demonstrated by studies showing that ( i ) receptor activation leads to proteolytic activation of at least three family members , FLICE/MACH/caspase-8 , CPP32/ caspase-3 , and ICE-LAP3/caspase-7 ( 8 , 29 , 37 ) ; ( ii ) inhibitors of caspases effectively block TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptosis ( 9 , 24 , 48 ) ; and finally , ( iii ) ectopic expression of caspases in several cells results in apoptosis ( 27 , 55 , 59 ) .
One of the sub-strates for caspases is poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) , which is involved in DNA repair ( 49 ) .
It is cleaved and inac-tivated by CPP32/caspase-3 during apoptosis ( 49 ) .
Recently , TNF was shown to induce caspase-dependent cleavage and activation of cytosolic phospholipase A ; , ( cPLA , ) ( 58 ) .
As inhibitors of cPLA , partially inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis without inhibition of caspase activity , cPLA , is likely to be a mediator of TNF-induced cell death acting downstream of the caspases ( 58 ) .
The activity of cPLA ; has also been shown to be crucial for TNF-induced lysis of adenovirus-infected cells ( 52 ) .
Viruses have evolved different strategies affecting different parts of the apoptotic pathway in order to avoid apoptosis ( for a review , see reference 38 ) .
For example , establishment of an effective adenoviral infection depends on the function of the 19-kDa E1B protein , which shows distant homology to Bel-2 and is able to protect cells from TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptosis ( 56 ) .
Other examples are the p35 protein of baculovirus and CrmA of cowpox virus , which are able to bind and inhibit multiple members of the caspase family and thereby to prevent apoptosis induced by various stimuli ( 3 , 4 , 9 , 48 ) .
In this study , using a cDNA expression cloning strategy , we have identified BHRF1 , an Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) early lytic protein with sequence homology to Bcel-2 , as an antiapoptosis protein .
Expression of BHRF1 in MCF-Fas cells renders them nearly completely resistant against both anti-Fas-and TNF-mediated apoptosis .
However , our data also show that expression of BHRFI in a B-cell line , BJAB , does not 7510 FOGHSGAARD AND JAATTELA protect them from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis , suggesting that the protective role of BHRF1 is cell type dependent , like that of Bel-2 .
Furthermore , we show that the TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of cPLA ; and caspase-3/CPP32 is inhibited in BHRF1-expressing MCF-Fas cells , whereas TNF-induced NF- « B-activation is not affected .
A putative role of BHRF1 in virus infection is discussed .

Plasmids .
pREP4 ( Invitrogen ) is an episomal eucaryotic expression vector in which the presence of both the EBV origin for plasmid replication ( orfP ) and the gene encoding Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 allow the vector to replicate extrachromosomally .
The plasmid contains a gene coding for hygromycin phos-photransferase , which confers resistance to hygromycin B. Inserted cDNA in a multicloning site is under the transcriptional control of the Rous sarcoma virus 3 ' long terminal repeat .
pRP-BHRF1 is the pREP4 plasmid containing cDNA coding for BHRF1 .

pEBS7 is also an EBV-based episomal vector , which differs from pREP4 only by having a cytomegalovirus promoter ( 17 ) .
pEBS7-Bcl-2 is the pEBS ?
7 plasmid containing the cDNA coding for human Bel-2 ( 17 ) .
Functional expression , cloning , and sequencing .
A poly ( T ) -primed cDNA library ( kindly provided by M. Buchwald , University of Toronto , Toronto , On-tario , Canada [ 42 ] ) made from mRNA from TNF-resistant EBV-transformed lymphoblasts cloned into vector pREP4 was used in the expression study .
The cDNA library consisted of 5 x 10° individual colonies , and gel electrophoresis of released inserts revealed a continuous DNA smear ranging in size from approximately 300 to 4,000 bp .
The cDNA library was introduced to the highly TNF-sensitive MCF7S1 cells by electroporation ; 4 X 10° cells were transfected with 20 to 60 g of library DNA ml~* , resuspended in CM , transferred to tissue culture flasks , and incubated at 37°C .
Two days later hygromycin ( 150 U/m !
1 ) was added , and the incubation was continued for 5 to 8 days to allow drug-resistant clones to reach confluence .
To obtain TNF-resistant clones , hygromycin-resistant clones were treated with 50 to 100 ng of TNF per ml for 24 h and incubated in CM containing hygromycin ( 150 U/m ! )
until they reached subconfluence .
Thereafter , the cells were trypsinized and plated on petri dishes , and treatment with TNF was repeated .
When the cells reached confluence following the second TNF treat-ment , episomal plasmid DNA was recovered by Hirt extraction ( 14 ) and introduced into DH10B electrocompetent bacteria ( Gibco ) by electroporation , as recommended by the manufacturer .
Transformants were plated on Luria-Bertani agar-ampicillin ( 120 ug/ml ! )
plates and incubated for 16 h at 37°C .
Colonies were resuspended in Luria-Bertani medium ( by using a rubber policeman ) and incubated in a bacterial shaker for 24 h at 37°C , and large-scale plasmid DNA was prepared by standard methods .
DNA sequences were determined by T7 DNA polymerase ( Sequenase , version 2.0 ; U.S. Biochemicals , Cleveland , Ohio ) following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer .
Electroporation .
Circular plasmid DNA was introduced into cells by electroporation ; 2 X 10 `` to 4 X 10 `` cells in logarithmic growth were trypsinized , resuspended in 0.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 20 to 60 ug of plasmid DNA , incubated at room temperature for 10 min , and transferred to an electroporation cuvette .
Following delivery of an electric pulse ( capacitance , 960 wF ; voltage , 850 V/cm ; resulting time constant , 11 to 13 ms ) , cells were incubated in the cuvette at room temperature for 5 min before resuspension in 20 ml of CM and transfer into 75-cm > tissue culture flasks .
After 48 h at 37°C , J. Viror .
hygromycin was added and the incubation was continued until drug-resistant clones reached confluence .
Western blot analysis .
Cells , 1 X 10° to 3 X 10° per lane , lysed in Laemmli sample buffer ( 23 ) or urea buffer followed by sonication , were resolved in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-12 % polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybond ECL filter paper ( Amersham International , Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom ) with an electroblotter ( Millipore ) .
Filters were blocked by incubation with 5 % low-fat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline ( TBS ) at 25°C for 1 h and washed twice in TBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 ( washing buffer ) .
The filters were incubated for 1 h at 25°C or for 18 h at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in the following concentrations in washing buffer containing 0.5 % low-fat milk powder : anti-BHRF1 , from Advanced Biotechnologies Inc. , 1:4,000 ; anti-Bcl-2 , kindly provided by G. Nunez , 1:500 ; and anti-PARP , kindly provided by G. G. Poirier , 1:10,000 .
Following three washes , the filters were incubated for 30 min at 25°C in washing buffer containing a 1:40,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody ( Dako Immunoglobulins , Glostrup , Denmark ) and 5 % low-fat milk powder .
After the filters were washed thoroughly , the chemiluminescence reaction was performed and they were exposed to ECL hyperfilm according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Amersham ) .
Cell viability assay .
The microculture tetrazolium assay was used to measure the viability of cells ( 28 ) .
Briefly , approximately 5,000 ( MCF7S1 or MCF-Fas ) or 20,000 ( BJAB ) target cells per well were plated in 96-well microtiter plates in 0.1 ml of CM , in medium containing the indicated amounts ( see the legend to Fig .
2 ) of TNF and anti-Fas antibody together with 1 ug of protein A ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , Mo . )
per ml , or in RPMI supplemented with the indicated concentrations of FCS .
After the indicated times ( see the legend to Fig .
2 ) at 37°C , 25 pil of dimethylthiazoly ] tetrazolium solution ( MTT ) ( 5 mg/ml ; Sigma ) was added and the incubation was continued for 3 h before addition of 100 pl of lysis buffer ( 20 % sodium dodecyl sulfate in a 50 % solution of N , N-dimethylformamide [ pH 4.5 ] ) .
Forming formazan crystals were allowed to dissolve for 16 h before the plates were read on a microplate reader , using a wavelength of 550 nm .
Effector cells .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were isolated from fresh heparinized blood obtained from healthy donors at the University Hospital of Copenhagen ( Rigshospitalet ) .
Sixty milliliters of blood was mixed and resuspended in 60 ml of PBS .
PBMC were obtained by centrifugation of erythrocytes through a Ficoll-Pague Plus ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) layer and collection of cells in the interphase .
The cells were washed two times in PBS , resuspended in CM , and incubated on petri dishes for 1 h at 37°C at a concentration of 1 10° to 3 X 10 % /cm > in order to isolate the monocytes ; the monocytes adhered to the surface while the rest of the mononuclear cells rested in solution .
To obtain lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) cells , the nonadherent cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1 X 10° to 2 X 10° cells/ml in CM supplemented with interleukin-2 ( 300 U/ml ; Amersham ) and incubated for 3 to 5 days at 37°C .
To obtain monocytes , the adherent cells were collected with a rubber policeman , resuspended in 4 ml of CM and centrifuged through a Percoll layer consisting of 43 % Percoll ( Pharmacia ) and 57 % CM .
The cell layer in the interphase was collected , washed , and resuspended at a concentration of 10° cells/ml in CM supplemented with £ .
coli lipopolysaccharide ( 0.5 ug/ml ; Sigma ) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Cytotoxicity assay .
Target cells ( 1 X 10° to 2 X 10° cells/ml ) were labeled with sodium ( 0.1 NEN , Boston , Mass . )
in CM for 1 h and washed twice in PBS .
The assay was set up in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates ( Greiner ) .
Target cell suspension , 5,000 cells in 0.1 ml of CM , was added to each well with 0.1-ml dilutions of effector cells , TNF , or anti-Fas antibody in CM .
After incubation for the required time at 37°C , `` Cr released into 0.1 ml of supernatant from each well was determined with an automatic gamma counter .
Assay for phospholipase A ; activity .
The incorporation of acid into membrane phospholipids of intact cells was done essentially as described previously ( 16 ) .
Briefly , 5 X 10° cells in 5 ml of CM supplemented with [ 5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-N-*HJarachidonic acid ( 0.3 mCi/ml ; NEN ) were plated in 10-cm-diameter petri dishes .
After 16 h at 37°C , cells were scraped with a rubber policeman , washed three times with PBS , and resuspended in CM at a concentration of 4 X 10° % /ml .
The assay was set up in triplicate in 24-well microtiter plates by adding 0.5 ml of cell suspension to each well with 0.1 ml of CM or medium containing the indicated dilutions ( see Fig .
5 ) of TNF or anti-Fas antibody .
After 18 h at 37°C , the plates were centrifuged at 1,000 x g and 0.3 ml of the supernatant was collected , mixed with 3 ml of Ecosint A scintillation fluid ( National Diagnostics , Manville , N.J. ) , and analyzed in a scintillation counter .
The radioactivity of °H released from cells treated with TNF or anti-Fas antibody was compared with the average radioactivity of °H released from cells incubated with medium alone and was expressed as a percentage , with the spontancous value being 100 % .
The spontaneous release of arachidonic acid from untreated cells was always less than 10 % of the total .
Transient transfection and luciferase assay .
Five micrograms of plasmid pBlIx , containing NF-kB binding sequences from human immunodeficiency virus , or pAP-LUC , containing an AP-1 binding site from the human collagenase gene upstream from the luciferase reporter gene , was cotransfected with 3 ug of plasmid pEBS-BGal into 2 X 10° to 5 X 10° cells , essentially as described previously ( 18 , 22 , 36 ) .
Two days after transfection , the cells were left untreated or were treated with the indicated concentrations ( see Fig .
4 ) of TNF 4 h before harvesting .
Luciferase activity was measured with the Promega luciferase assay voL .
71 , 1997 system .
The lysates used for the luciferase assay were also tested for B-galacto-sidase activity ( control for transfection efficiency ) by using ortho-nitrophenyl-B-p-galactopyranoside ( Sigma ) as a chromogenic substrate , and the values from the luciferase assay were corrected accordingly .
RESULTS Cloning of BHRF1 by functional expression cloning .
To identify proteins that protect cells from the cytotoxic effects of TNF , a cDNA library originating from TNF-resistant EBV-transformed lymphoblasts was transfected into MCF7S1 cells by electroporation .
Hygromycin-resistant cells were exposed to 50 ng of TNF per ml for 24 h , and surviving cells ( 0.1 to 1 % ) were allowed to reach subconfluence before another 24-h exposure to TNF .
Episomal plasmid DNA from surviving cells was recovered by HIRT extraction ( 14 ) and amplified in bac-teria ; the selection process was repeated three times .
The resistance of transfected cells to TNF clearly increased by each round , and a plasmid containing a cDNA insert of approximately 1.7 kb was enriched .
After three selection rounds , the 1.7-kb insert was found in approximately 5 % of the plasmids .
The rescued plasmid containing the 1.7-kb insert was transfected into MCF7S1 cells , and hygromycin-resistant cells were tested for their sensitivity to TNF in a 48-h MTT cell viability assay ( 28 ) .
The sensitivity was compared with that of hygromycin B-resistant MCF7S1 cells transfected in parallel with an empty control vector , pEBS7 .
The 1.7-kb insert clearly protected cells from the TNF-induced cytotoxicity , as it conferred 80 to 90 % resistance to TNF killing at concentrations of up to 100 ng/ml ( data not shown ) .
The cDNA was then sequenced , and comparison of the obtained sequence with the GenBank database revealed nearly complete homology ( 99 % ) to published cDNA sequences encoding BHRF1 .
BHRF1 is an EBV early lytic protein with a molecular mass of 17 kDa .
BHRF1 displays limited homology to Bcl-2 , with the alignment of BHRF1 and Bcl-2 revealing approximately 25 % amino acid identity .
BHRF1 protects MCF-Fas cells from TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptosis .
To allow a comparison of TNF- and Fas-induced killing in the same cell line , MCF7 cells successfully transfected with human Fas cDNA ( MCF-Fas ) were used ( 17 ) .
To test the ability of BHRF1 to protect MCF-Fas cells from anti-Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis , cells were transfected with pREP4 expression vector containing the cDNA encoding BHRF1 ( pRP-BHRF1 ) .
The cells were , in parallel , transfected with the pREP4 vector containing cDNA coding for B-galac-tosidase or with a closely related pEBS7 expression plasmid ( empty vector ) .
Two independent transfections of pRP-BHRF1 generated two hygromycin B-resistant cell populations ( MCF-BHRF1.1 and MCF-BHRF1.2 ) that stably expressed BHRF1 , as analyzed by Western blotting ( Fig .
1 ) .
The sensitivity of transfected MCF-Fas cells to TNF- and anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis was analyzed in a 48-h MTT cell viability assay .
As shown in Fig .
2 , the control cells ( MCF-pEBS7 and MCF-Bgal ) were killed in a dose-dependent man-ner .
In contrast , MCF-Fas cells expressing BHRF1 were nearly completely resistant to apoptosis mediated by either TNF or anti-Fas .
The degree of resistance conferred by BHRF1 was identical to that obtained by overexpression of either Bel-2 or Bcl-x , in MCF-Fas cells ( 17 ) .
The protective effect of BHRF1 was emphasized by the morphological changes of control cells versus BHRF1-expressing cells after stimulation with TNF or anti-Fas .
As shown in Fig .
2¢ , untreated MCF-pEBS7 and MCF-BHRF1.1 cells grew equally well and were morphologi-cally alike , whereas the difference was clear for cells treated with TNF .
After 24 h with TNF , control cells displayed morphological alterations typical of adherent cells undergoing ap- BHRFI AND APOPTOSIS - 7511 po ' A & y & 4 ¥ $ § 4 G44 .

Detection of BHRF1 expression in transfected MCF-Fas cells by Western blot analysis .
MCF-Fas cells were transfected with pRP-BHRF1 ( MCF-BHRFL.1 and MCF-BHRFL2 ) , pRP-fgal ( MCF-Bgal ) , or pEBS7 ( MCF-pEBS7 ) by electroporation .
Cell lysates from approximately 3 x 10° hygromycin-resistant cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis employing anti-BHRF1 antibody ( Advanced Biotechnologies Inc. ) and ECL reagents ( Amersham ) .
Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left .
optosis , becoming rounded , condensed , and detached from the dish , whereas BHRF1-expressing cells did not show any morphological changes .
The same pattern of morphological changes was seen following treatment with anti-Fas ( data not shown ) .
BHRF1 protects MCF-Fas cells from cytotoxicity mediated by monocytes and serum starvation but not from LAK cells .
To test whether BHRF1 protects cells from mediators of cell death other than TNF or anti-Fas , the killing of cells by activated monocytes , LAK cells , and serum starvation were tested .
The sensitivity of transfected MCF-Fas cells to killing by activated monocytes was analyzed by an 18-h chromium release assay with MCF-Fas transfectants as target cells and activated monocytes as effector cells .
Control cells were killed in a dose-dependent manner ranging from 3 to 38 % at effector-to-target ratios ranging from 1:1 to 64:1 ( Fig .
3a ) .
BHRF1 protected cells from killing by monocytes in a manner similar to that in which cells were protected from killing by TNF ( Fig .
3a and 2a ) .
A 4-h chromium release assay with LAK cells as effector cells and MCF-Fas transfectants as target cells showed that BHRF1 was unable to protect cells from LAK-cell-mediated killing : 7 to 90 % of the target cells were killed in 4 h at effector-to-target cell ratios ranging from 1:1 to 64:1 .
There was no significant difference in killing of cells expressing BHRF1 and vector-transfected cells ( Fig .
3a ) .
Similar results were obtained with MCF-Fas cells overexpressing either Bel-2 or Bel-x ; , both proteins conferring resistance against monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity but failing to protect cells against LAK -cell-mediated killing ( Fig .
3b ) .
To test whether BHRF1 was able to protect cells from serum starvation , the survival of transfected MCF-Fas cells in low serum concentrations ( 0.5 to 2 % ) was tested by a 7-day MTT assay .
The survival of BHRF1-expressing cells was approximately twice as high as that of vector-transfected control cells ( Fig .
3¢c ) .
Thus , the ability of BHRF1 to protect MCF-Fas cells from serum starvation is of a magnitude similar to that of Bel-2 or Bel-x , , ( 18 ) .
BHRF1 does not interfere with activation of NF-KB-like and AP-1 transcription factors .
TNF , but not anti-Fas , activates NF-kB-like and AP-1-like transcription factors in MCF-Fas cells ( 17 ) .
In order to analyze if the expression of BHRF1 interferes with the activation of these two transcription factors , a luciferase reporter gene assay was used employing MCF-Fas cells transiently transfected with a plasmid containing two kB 7512 FOGHSGAARD AND JAATTELA a 19 “ \A ’ / ‘ 80 A a - @ - - MCF-pEBST7 a A - =O - - MCF-betagal s A -- & - - MCF-BHAF11 G.

BHRF1 does not affect TNF-induced activation of NF- « B-like ( a ) and AP-1 ( b ) transcription factors .
Luciferase activity was measured in cells transiently transfected with plasmid pBIIX , containing two copies of NF-kB binding sites ( a ) , or pAP-LUC , containing an AP-1 binding site upstream of the Photinus pyralis luciferase coding sequence ( b ) .
The efficiency of each transfection was monitored by a cotransfected cytomegalovirus promoter-driven LacZ construct ( pEBS7-Bgal ) .
Forty-eight hours after transfection , cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 4 h with the indicated concentrations of TNF before harvesting .
The lysates were tested for luciferase activity and B-galacto-sidase activity .

The expression of BHRF1 did not affect the activation of either NF-kB-like or AP-1-like transcription factors ( Fig .

Similar results have been obtained with MCF-Fas cells overexpressing Bel-2 or Bel-x , , ( 17 ) .
Activation of cPLA , by TNF and anti-Fas is inhibited by BHRF1 .
The release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids by cPLA ; has been suggested to be an essential link in TNF- and anti-Fas-mediated cytotoxicity and has been shown to be inhibited by overexpression of Bel-2 or Bel-x , ( 17 ) .
To test whether BHRF1 was able to inhibit TNF- or anti-Fas-induced activation of cPLA , , the release of radioactivity from cells labeled with [ °HJarachidonic acid was measured .
An 18-h exposure of vector-transfected MCF-Fas cells ( MCF-pEBS $ 7 ) to TNF ( 1 to 100 ng/ml ) or anti-Fas ( 1 to 25 ng/ml ) induced a dose-dependent release of radioactivity , the maximum release being 2.0-fold ( TNF ) or 2.1-fold ( anti-Fas ) higher than the release from cells incubated in medium alone .

The assay was set up in triplicate in 24-well microtiter plates by adding 2 X 10° cells in 0.6 ml of medium or medium containing the indicated concentrations of TNF or anti-Fas plus protein A ; after 18 h of incubation at 37°C , 0.3 ml of the supernatant was collected and the radioactivity released was analyzed in a scintillation counter .
The spontancous release was set to 100 % .
In the PARP analysis , MCF-Fas transfectants were exposed to TNF ( 30 ng/m ! )
or anti-Fas ( 10 ng/m ! )
for 24 h , after which cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting with the anti-PARP monoclonal antibody as described in Materials and Methods .

The level of inhibition by BHRFI1 is comparable to that of Bel-2 or Bel-x , , in MCF-Fas cells ( 17 ) .
BHRF1 inhibits the activation of caspase-3 .
To see whether BHRF1 was able to inhibit the TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of CPP32/caspase-3 , the integrity of the death substrate PARP was analyzed .
Vector-transfected MCF-Fas cells revealed partial cleavage of the native 116-kDa PARP to the signature 85-kDa proteolytic fragment within a 24-h exposure to TNF ( 30 ng/ml ) or anti-Fas ( 10 ng/ml ) .
In MCF-Fas cells expressing BHRF1 there were no detectable levels of the 85-kDa proteolytic product , indicating that BHRF1 inhibits the activation of CPP32/caspase-3-like proteases ( Fig .
5b ) .
Simi-larly , TNF and anti-Fas failed to induce cleavage of PARP to the 85-kDa fragment in MCF-Fas cells overexpressing either Bel-2 or Bel-x , , ( data not shown ) .
BHRF1 does not protect BJAB cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis .
As shown above , BHRF1 is able to protect MCF-Fas cells from various apoptotic stimuli , such as TNF , Fas , monocytes , and serum starvation .
This suggests that BHRF1 is a general inhibitor of apoptosis and functions where the various apoptotic stimuli converge into a common death pathway .
To test whether protection against apoptosis is a universal feature of BHRF1 , which could contribute to the pathogenesis of EBV , we extended the studies to another cell line , a human 7514 FOGHSGAARD AND JAATTELA A ~ a & & Cy & 3 & 3 £ p° @ A $ J $ $ @ @ @ .

Detection of BHRF1 ( a ) or Bcl-2 ( b ) in transfected BJAB cells by Western blot analysis .
BJAB cells were transfected with plasmid pRP-BHRF1 ( BJAB-BHRF1 } , pEBS7-Bcl-2 ( BJAB-Bcl-2 ) , pRP-Bgal ( BJAB-fgal ) , or pEBS7 ( BJAB-pEBS7 ) by electroporation .

EBV-negative B-cell line , BJAB , which is sensitive to Fas-mediated cytotoxicity but resistant to killing by TNF .
pRP-BHRF1 was transfected into BJAB cells to create a cell population constitutively expressing BHRF1 .
In parallel , BJAB cells were transfected with the pRP-fgal expression plasmid or an empty expression vector , pEBS7 , creating two control cell populations .
In order to compare the effect of BHRF1 with that of Bel-2 , BJAB cells were also transfected with the pEBS7-Bcl-2 expression plasmid .
A Western blot analysis showed expression of BHRF1 in BJAB-BHRF1 cells and overexpression of Bel-2 in BJAB-Bcl-2 cells , compared to the endogenous expression in control transfected cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
The sensitivity of transfected cells to anti-Fas was tested by a 6-h MTT assay .
A comparison between BJAB cells expressing BHRF1 and the parental cell line , the control transfected cells , or Bel-2-ex-pressing cells did not show any significant difference in sensitivity towards anti-Fas ( Fig .
7a ) .
Thus , forced expression of BHRF1 or Bel-2 did not protect BJAB cells from Fas-mediated killing .
BHRF1 protects BJAB cells from serum starvation .
As the expression of BHRF1 did not affect the sensitivity of BJAB cells to anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis , we tested whether BJAB-BHRF1 cells were protected from another apoptotic stimulus , serum starvation .
The four BJAB transfectants were then screened for survival over a 9-day period after transfer into medium with a reduced ( 0.5 % ) FCS content .
An aliquot was tested for cell viability by MTT assay every day from day 1 to day 7 .
Every second day , the MTT assay was accompanied by counting of the cells in trypan blue to verify that the cells were actually dying by serum starvation .
BHRF1-expressing BJAB cells showed significantly enhanced survival compared to control cells ( Fig .

After 5 days of incubation , 30 % of the BHRF1-expressing cells had survived serum starvation while only 5 % of the control cells were alive .

Expression of BHRF1 or overexpression of Bel-2 does not protect BJAB cells from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis ( a ) , but it enhances the survival of serum-starved BJAB cells ( b ) .
To measure the sensitivity of cells to anti-Fas , approximately 20,000 cells per well were plated in 96-well plates with the indicated concentrations of anti-Fas antibody with 1 ug of protein A per ml .
The percentage of surviving cells was analyzed by MTT assay after a 6-h incubation .
In the serum starvation assay , cells were grown in medium containing 0.5 % FCS with an initial cell concentration of 400,000 cells/ml .

DISCUSSION This study was undertaken to investigate signal transduction pathways involved in apoptosis induced by cross-linking and activation of cell surface receptors for TNF and FasL .
Our first aim was to identify gene products that inhibit this pathway .
By functional expression cloning , the EBV early-lytic-cycle protein BHRF1 was identified as an antiapoptosis protein .
Expression of BHRF1 in MCF-Fas cells led to nearly complete inhibition of cell death induced by TNF , anti-Fas antibody , monocytes , and serum starvation .
EBV is a human herpesvirus with oncogenic potential and is predominantly associated with infection of two target tissues in vivo : B lymphocytes , where the infection is largely nonproduc-tive , and stratified squamous epithelium , in which virus repli- voL .
71 , 1997 cation occurs ( 26 ) .
Both cell types are susceptible to EBV-associated transformation , resulting in tumors of B-cell origin , Burkitt 's lymphoma and immunoblastic lymphoma , or of epithelial cell origin , nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric ade-nocarcinoma ( 26 ) .
BHRF1 is an EBV gene product of undetermined function .
It is a constituent of all EBV genomes , suggesting that it has an important role in the viral life cycle ( 21 ) .
Spliced BHRF1 transcripts have been identified in latently infected B cells , although the 17-kDa protein has yet to be detected in these cells ( 35 ) .
However , in the early phase of the viral replicative cycle both BHRF1 protein and transcripts are expressed in abundance ( 35 ) .
The expression of BHRF1 is not required for viral replication or B-cell transformation , since recombinant virus in which BHRF1 has been deleted in vitro is both transforming and able to enter the replicative cycle ( 25 ) .
These BHRF1-negative transformed B cells express the full range of viral latent gene products , suggesting an essential role for these proteins ( 25 ) .
The influence of BHRF1 , however , is much more likely to be felt in the lytic cycle , in which the protein is abundantly expressed and the expression of latent genes is turned off .
The BHRF1 protein of EBV may be a structural homolog of the Bcel-2 protein .
Alignment of BHRF1 and Bel-2 has revealed some 25 % amino acid identity ( 25 ) , in which the sequences corresponding to the BH1 , BH2 , and BH3 domains are highly conserved ( 7 ) .
This and previous studies indicate that BHRF1 is also functionally related to Bel-2 and the other family member , Bcl-x ; Previous functional studies have shown that ectopic expression of BHRF1 can block apoptosis induced by various stimuli , such as withdrawal of serum ( 13 ) , withdrawal of other growth factors , treatment with anticancer agents , infection with heterologous virus ( 45 ) , and ectopic expression of the tumor suppres-sor protein p53 ( 50 ) .
This study shows that expression of BHRF1 in MCF-Fas cells nearly completely blocks the apoptotic pathway induced by TNF or anti-Fas even in long-term assays with high concentrations of effector molecules .
Moreover , we show that expression of BHRF1 protects MCF-Fas cells from monocyte-mediated killing in a manner similar to that of Bel-2 and Bcel-x , , .
TNF is the major mediator of cell death used by monocytes ( 1 , 19 ) ; thus , this result emphasizes the protective effect of BHRF1 against this cytokine .
The ability of BHRFI1 to protect epithelial cells from TNF- and anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis is supported by a recent publication showing that expression of BHRF1 protected 407 intestinal epithelial cells against apoptosis induced by combination of cycloheximide and TNF or anti-Fas antibody ( 20 ) .
Therefore , BHRF1 may , like Bcel-2 in epithelial cells , be a general inhibitor of apoptosis , acting at a point at which the different signaling pathways converge into a common apoptotic pathway .
Surprisingly , however , expression of BHRF1 or overexpression of Bel-2 did not protect BJAB cells from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis .
BHRF1 and Bel-2 did , however , increase the survival of BJAB cells deprived of serum .
Two other groups have obtained similar results with Bel-2 in lymphocytes : overexpression of Bel-2 protected lymphocytes from gamma radiation , staurosporine , and serum deprivation but not from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis ( 5 , 41 ) .
Those authors raised the possibility that Bel-2 and anti-Fas may regulate distinct pathways to apoptosis .
In contrast , however , a recent study shows very clearly that overexpression of Bel-2 inhibits Fas-induced activation of caspase-3/CPP32 and apoptosis in lymphocytes ( 2 ) .
Our present and previous results ( 17 ) showing complete inhibition of anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis by BHRF1 , Bel-2 , and Bcl-x , in MCF-Fas cells suggest that these proteins can regulate Fas BHRFI AND APOPTOSIS - 7515 induced apoptosis but that their effect upon it is dependent on the cell type .
The different results obtained with MCF-Fas and BJAB cells may be explained through different expression levels of positive and negative regulators of apoptosis .
The protective effect seen in the MCF-Fas cells may be due to the high expression levels of BHRF1 , which can overcome and prevent homodimerization between preexisting low levels of death-promoting proteins .
In contrast , the expression levels of BHRF1 or Bcel-2 in BJAB cells may be too low to prevent homodimerization of a high level of preexisting positive regu-lators .
But why then do we see an effect by BHRF1 and Bel-2 in serum starvation of BJAB cells ?
This difference might be explained by the strength of the given stimuli .
The anti-Fas stimulus in BJAB cells is very strong , resulting in complete killing of target cells in 6 h , whereas withdrawal of growth factors is a weak death stimulus , with killing taking several days .
It is important to note that anti-Fas-induced cell death in MCF-Fas cells takes 24 to 48 h. Thus , one possibility is that the Fas-induced death signal in BJAB cells is so strong that it breaks through the checkpoint regulated by the Bcl-2 family .
Contrary to monocyte-mediated killing , BHRF1 , Bel-2 , or Bcl-x , , expression did not protect MCF-Fas cells from LAK-cell-mediated killing .
Recent results have demonstrated that the perforin-granzyme B-mediated and Fas-mediated pathways are the two most important mechanisms used by LAK cells in mediating cytotoxicity ( 39 , 53 ) .
As anti-Fas killing takes 24 to 48 h , and as BHRF1 , Bel-2 , and Bel-x , , protected MCF-Fas cells from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis , it is likely that the killing of MCF-Fas cells by LAK cells in the 4-h assay was mediated through the perforin-granzyme B pathway .
In the perforin-granzyme B pathway , the LAK cells deliver lethal hits by releasing their granule contents after binding to the target cell .
The inability of BHRF1 , Bel-2 , or Bel-x , , to protect MCF-Fas from perforin-granzyme B-mediated cell death may be explained in one of two ways .
Pores formed by perforin may induce a loss of cell membrane integrity , which may result in a necrotic form of cell death unpreventable by BHRF1 , Bel-2 , or Bcl-x , or the entrance of granzyme B to the cell may be responsible for induction of apoptosis and bypass the otherwise protective effect of BHRF1 , Bel-2 , or Bel-x , .
Apoptosis induced by granzyme B can not be inhibited by Bel-2 , and recent findings suggest that granzyme B-induced cell death occurs via direct activation of downstream caspases , thus bypassing the inhibitory effect of the Bel-2 family ( 5 , 6 ) .
Our data show that BHRF1 , Bel-2 , and Bcl-x , are able to inhibit cyto-kine-induced activation of caspase-3/CPP32 , making the latter hypothesis possible .
Several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of cPLA ; in the cytotoxic pathway of TNF and Fas ( 11 , 17 , 32 , 52 , 58 ) .
This idea is further supported by our data showing that expression of BHRF1 inhibited the activation of cPLA ; by TNF and anti-Fas in a manner that paralleled their ability to inhibit cell death .
Interestingly , other inhibitors of TNF-induced apoptosis , such as heat shock protein 70 , Bel-2 , and Bcl-x , , also inhibit TNF-induced activation of cPLA , ( 16 , 17 ) .
Activated cPLA , releases arachidonic acid from the s » -2 position of phospho-lipids , which provides a source for the production of biologically active lipid mediators such as prostaglandins and leuko-trienes ( 12 ) .
Thus , BHRF1 may , through its inhibition of cPLA ; , also act as an anti-inflammatory factor .
A putative function of BHRFI1 could be to protect EBV-infected epithelial cells from TNF- and/or Fas-induced cell death in order to maximize virus production .
Both TNF and Fas exhibit antiviral activity and may be two components of the immune system 's response to viral infection .
Another putative role of BHRF1 may be inhibition of apoptosis during malig- 7516 FOGHSGAARD AND JAATTELA nant transformation of infected cells .
Although BHRF1 ( like Bcl-2 ) alone is insufficient to cause transformation , the surviving cells could provide the substrate for further genetic changes in conventional oncogenes such as c-myc .
The role of BHRF1 in EBV-infected lymphoid cells remains unclear .
