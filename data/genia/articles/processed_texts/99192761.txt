6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; Impaired Fetal Thymocyte Development After Efficient Adenovirus-Mediated Inhibition of NF-rB Activation Talitha R. Bakker , * `` Toufic Renno , '* and C. Victor Jongeneel `` * We introduce a new experimental system combining adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) .
This system allowed us to efficiently express in developing thymocytes a mutant form of the NF-KB inhibitor IxBa ( mut-IxB ) and to study the maturation defects occurring when NF-KB activation is inhibited during fetal development .
Fetal thymocytes infected with adenovirus containing mut-IxB were found to develop normally until the CD44-CD25¢ , CD4~CD8~ double-negative stage , while production of more mature double-positive and single-positive populations was strongly decreased .
Proliferation , as measured by the percentage of cells in cycle appeared normal , as did rearrangement and expression of the TCR -chain .
However , apoptosis was much higher in FTOC infected with adenovirus containing mut-IxB than in FTOC infected with a control virus .
Taken together , these results suggest that NF-B plays a crucial role in ensuring the differentiation and survival of thymocytes in the early stages of their development .
hymic differentiation starts on days 11-12 of gestation , when hemopoietic stem cells from the yolk sac and fetal liver start to populate the thymus .
There , they undergo a series of differentiation steps under the influence of their interactions with stromal cells and of the resulting signaling events ( 1 , 2 ) .
Using proteins expressed on the surface of developing thymocytes as markers , several stages in development can be detected by flow cytometry .
As stem cells expressing low levels of CD4 migrate into the cortex of the thymus , they down-regulate CD4 and become CD4-CD8~ ( DN ) prothymocytes , which express CD44 but not CD25 ( 3 ) .
Then CD25 is up-regulated , closely followed by down-regulation of CD44 .
As DN thymocytes reach their most mature state , expression of CD25 is gradually lost ( 4 ) .
During the DN stage , the TCRB gene is rearranged ( 5 , 6 ) , and upon expression of the pTa gene product , as part of the pre-TCR complex , further differentiation and expansion occur ( 7 ) .
After transition through an immature single-positive ( SP ) stage , during which CD8 is expressed but not the mature TCR , cells become double positive ( DP ) , expressing both CD4 and CD8 .
At this stage TCRa is rearranged , and a mature TCRaf is expressed at intermediate levels on the cell surface .
Next , the cells move to the medulla through the cortico-medullary junction where they are positively selected for self-MHC recognition and negatively selected for recognition of *Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research , Lausanne Branch , University of Lausanne , Lausanne , Switzerland ; and *Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research , Epalinges , Switzerland Received for publication August 10 , 1998 .

Finally , either the CD4 or the CD8 coreceptor is down-regulated , and is up-regulated to form mature , SP cells that ultimately migrate to the periphery ( 8 , 9 ) .
The differentiation steps described above result from a sequence of signaling events .
Among candidate mediators of maturation signals are members of the transcription factor family NF- « B/Rel .
NF-KB is a ubiquitous , constitutively expressed factor that is normally kept in an inactive form in the cytoplasm by IB .
Upon receiving an activation signal , IB is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded .
NF- « B then moves to the nucleus , where it induces the transcription of a variety of genes ( 10-12 ) .
A role for NF-KB in the regulation of thymocyte development is suggested by its high expression in the thymus and the fact that NF-KB family members are differentially expressed in the thymic compartments ; RelA is expressed in the cortex , while ReIB and c-Rel are preferentially expressed in the medulla ( 13-15 ) .
Several groups have tried to elucidate the role of NF-KB in thymocyte development by studying mice deficient in the genes coding for individual family members or by overexpressing factors that inhibit NF-KB activation .
Mice deficient for individual NF- « B/Re !
l subunits exhibit no intrinsic defects in T cell development .
However , gene targeting approaches are complicated by the functional redundancy that exists in the family ; for example , complexes containing either c-Rel or RelA have the potential to stimulate transcription from the same promoter ( 16 , 17 ) .
To circumvent this problem two groups have recently made transgenic mice expressing the NF-KB inhibitor I « kBa under a lymphocyte-specific promoter .
This inhibitor functions as a constitutive repressor of multiple NF- « B/Rel proteins .
Although it was shown that the total number of thymocytes was decreased in these mice and that there was a defect in their development ( 18 , 19 ) , this system does not allow us to pinpoint the exact developmental stage at which NF-KB is involved .
We used a novel technique combining adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) to determine at which stage of fetal thymic development NF-KB is critical .
We infected FTOC with an adenovirus containing an IB cDNA ( mut-IkB ) from which the N-terminal phosphorylation sites have been removed , resulting in an IB with a prolonged half-life ( 20 ) .
Using this technique , we show that inhibition of NF- « B activation results in impaired transition from the * to the CD44 ~CD25~ developmental stage and an increased sensitivity to apoptosis .

Cells were counted after 6 days in culture .
The mean and standard deviation of 20 experiments ( 10 ' pfu/well infec-tions ) or 3 experiments ( 10° pfu/well infections , noninfected and transgenic mice ) are indicated .
Materials and Methods Construction and maintenance of recombinant adenoviral vectors The AdCMVB-gal recombinant virus was constructed as previosuly described ( 21 ) .
Briefly , a 3.5-kb HindlW/BamHI fragment containing the Escherichia coli lacZ gene was ligated into the viral plasmid pACCMV95 to produce pACB-gal .
pACCMV95 contains the 5 `` 6242 bp of Ad-5 from which the region 454-3328 bp has been deleted ( the deletion incorporates all of the E1A and part of the E1B region ) and includes a CMV interme-diate-early promoter upstream of the cloning site and an SV40 polyade-nylation signal downstream .
The pACB-gal was cotransfected together with JM17 ( which contains an Ad-5 viral backbone ) into 293 cells .
Ho-mologous recombination between the two plasmids resulted in the production of infectious recombinant adenovirus expressing the bacterial B-ga-lactosidase ( -gal ) protein .
A similar strategy was used to create AdCMVmut-I « B ( 22 ) .
To make the mut-I « B construct , the Xho-BamHI fragment of MAD3pBS ( containing a human IxBa cDNA lacking phosphorylation sites ) ( 20 ) was ligated to the nuclear localization sequence of the proto-oncogene c-myc .
The blunt/Xbal fragment containing mut-IxB without a promoter was then ligated into the viral plasmid pACCMV95 and cotransfected with JM17 into 293 cells .
Transfected 293 cells were harvested , and individual plaques were isolated and purified as described previously ( 23 ) .
Large stocks were produced and concentrated before being titrated by plaque and limiting dilution assays .
Concentrated stocks typically had titers in the range of 10°-10'° pfu/ml .
Mice Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan CPB ( Zeist , The Netherlands ) or were bred under standard conditions in the animal facilities of the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research ( Epalinges , Swit-zerland ) .
IxBa : transgenic mice ( 18 ) were generated and bred under standard conditions .
Fetal thymus organ culture Fetal thymi were isolated from C57BL/6 mice or IxBa transgenic mice on day 14 of gestation and transferred to membranes of a transwell system ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) .
Eight to ten lobes were cultured per well .
The lower compartment was filled with complete DMEM-10 medium ( 24 ) containing 2-ME and 10 `` pfu of either AdCMVmut-IxB or AdCMVB-gal .
To obtain the data shown in Fig .
2 and Table I , either 10 `` or 10° pfu of virus was used .
Both medium and virus were changed every 3 days .
After 6 days or as indicated in the figure legends , thymic lobes were harvested and mechanically disrupted .
Approximately 80 lobes/experiment were ana-lyzed , which were normally divided into pools of eight lobes .
Single cells were stained and analyzed by FACS .
Abs and flow cytometry Single-cell suspensions of thymocytes were incubated on ice with saturating concentrations of the following Abs : anti-CD4-CyChrome , anti-CD4-PE , anti-CD8-CyChrome , anti-CD3-PE , anti-TCRaB-PE , anti-TCRof-CyChrome , and anti-CD44-CyChrome ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) ; hamster IgG-PE , anti-TCRy8 tri-color and anti-CD25-PE ( Caltag , San Francisco , CA ) ; anti-CD4-R613 and anti-CD8-R613 ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) ; FITC-labeled anti-CD44 ( Pgp-1 ) ( 25 ) ; and FITC-labeled anti-CD8 H35 ( 26 ) .
Intracellular staining was performed as previously described ( 27 ) .
Three- and four-color analyses were performed on 3457 FACScan and FACStar Plus cytofluorometers , respectively , using LYSIS II software ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
Fluorescent -gal assay Detection of B-gal by FACS was performed as previously described ( 28 ) .
Cells previously stained with surface Abs were incubated at a density of 10-10 `` cells/ml in 100 l of PBS/FCS during 5 min at 37°C .
Then they were hypotonically loaded with the B-gal substrate , fluorescein di-B- » -galactopyranoside ( Sigma , Buchs , Switzerland ) , for 1 min .
Loading was stopped by the addition of PBS containing 300 uM chloroquine .
After 1 h of incubation on ice , cells were analyzed by FACS .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay Fetal thymocytes were put into culture and were infected with either AdCMVB-gal or After 2 days , thymocytes were harvested , and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed on crude nuclear extracts as described previously ( 29 ) .
Briefly , extracts were incubated with a °°P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide derived from the « B enhancer of the mouse light chain locus before separation in an 8 % acrylamide gel in 0.25 % TBE .
The amount of probe trapped in a DNA/ protein complex was quantitated by exposing the dried gel to an imaging plate of an autoradiography system ( BAS , Fuji , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Protein concentrations in extracts were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) to ensure equal loading .
Bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) assay To detect cell proliferation , BrdU ( 1 pg/ml ) was added to the cultures 10 h before harvest .
Thymic lobes were mechanically disrupted , and single cells were stained with Abs detecting cell surface Ags .
Cells were then resus-pended in 25 ul of 0.15 M NaCl , after which 70 ul of ice-cold 95 % ethanol was added .
After 30 min incubation on ice , cells were washed and incubated in 100 pl of PBS containing 1 % paraformaldehyde and 0.01 % Tween-20 .
Fixed cells were washed and stained with anti-BrdU-FITC ( Becton Dickinson ) in the presence of 0.5 % Tween after blocking nonspe-cific binding with rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. Cell cycle analysis Different populations within the DN compartment were sorted by FACS .
Cell suspensions were then fixed with 70 % ethanol at 4°C for 30 min , washed in PBS , and stained with 50 g/ml propidium iodide .
DNA content was analyzed using doublet discrimination on FACS .
Quantitation of apoptosis by annexin V-FITC To quantify apoptosis , thymic lobes were mechanically disrupted and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After incubation , 10°-10° cells were washed in 100 pl of binding buffer .
Then they were incubated with a 1/500 dilution of annexin V-FITC ( NeXins Research , Leiden , The Netherlands ) for 20 min on ice before apoptosis was quantified by FACS .
Quantitation of apoptosis by TUNEL Thymic lobes were mechanically disrupted and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Cells undergoing DNA fragmentation were detected with the TUNEL method ( terminal deoxyribonucleotidy ] transferase labeling of DNA strand breaks with BrdU ; Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Stained cells were analyzed by FACS .
Results Infection of fetal thymocytes with adenovirus To assess the role of NF-KB in fetal thymocyte development , we developed a system for adenovirus-mediated gene expression in FTOC .
To monitor whether fetal thymocytes can be infected with adenovirus , fetal thymi were placed in culture on days 14-15 of gestation in the presence of 10 `` pfu AdCMVB-gal .
This virus directs expression of B-gal , allowing easy monitoring of infection based on enzymatic activity .
Fetal thymi cultured under the same conditions in the presence of 10 `` pfu AdCMVmut-IxB were used as a control for the B-gal assay .
At different times after infection cells were harvested and treated with a -gal substrate ( fluorescein di-B -- galactopyranoside ) that fluoresces after cleavage , and fluorescence was measured by FACS .
Virtually all fetal thymocytes cultured with AdCMVB-gal ( Fig .

Similar infection levels were found at all time points analyzed ( after 2 , 4 , 6 , or 7 days of cul-ture ) , and development kinetics of AdCMV B-gal-infected thymocytes were comparable to those of uninfected thymocytes ( data not shown ) .
NF-KB in fetal thymocyte development To investigate the influence of NF- « B on fetal thymic development , fetal thymi were taken on days 14-15 of gestation , transferred to Transwell plates ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) , and infected with AdCMVmut-I « B .
This virus expresses a mutant IxBa with a prolonged half-life , which functions as a constitutive repressor of NF-KB ( 20 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from fetal thymocytes cultured for 2 days in the presence of either viral vector revealed a fourfold or higher reduction in the more slowly migrating , active form of NF-KB in the AdCMVmut-I « B-infected thymocytes ( Fig .
1A ) .
Earlier studies had shown that this band consists of a mixture of RelA , c-Rel , and presumably RelB complexed to NF- « B1/p50 ( 14 , 15 , 30 ) .
Thymocyte development was analyzed after 6 days of culture in the presence of the virus and compared with the development of thymocytes that were infected with the control virus AdCMV B-gal .
Fig .

Fetal thymi infected with either AdCMVmut-IxB or AdCMVB-gal were analyzed by flow cytometry after 6 days of culture .

observed among the CD4 * SP cells .
The total CD8 * SP compartment was not significantly decreased , but if only mature CD8 * SP cells are considered ( as defined by high levels of TCRB expres-sion ) , a significant reduction in the proportion of these cells was observed following AdCMVmut-IkB infection .
As the total number of thymocytes in AdCMVmut-I « B-infected thymi was twofold less than that in those infected with AdCMV B-gal ( Table I ) , there was no significant difference in absolute numbers in the DN population , while the reduction in the DP and mature SP populations was highly significant ( p < 0.0001 ; Fig .
2C ) .
Interestingly , FTOC from IxBa transgenic mice ( 18 ) showed a similar impairment of thymocyte maturation to the DP stage as FTOC infected with 10 `` pfu AdCMVmut-IkB , while FTOCs infected with 10 `` or 10° pfu AdCMVB-gal developed in a similar way as uninfected FTOC from C57BL/6 mice ( Fig .
3 ) .
When thymocytes were infected with 10° pfu of AdCMVmut-IxB , DP and SP populations were virtually absent ( Fig .
2 , B and C ) .
To further characterize this developmental block , DN cells were stained with anti-CD25 and anti-CD44 Abs .
As shown in Fig .

Impairment in maturation of thymocytes in FTOCs from IxBa transgenic mice .
Fetal thymi from either wild-type ( WT ) C57BL/6 or IxBa transgenic mice were analyzed by flow cytometry after 6 days of culture .
CD4/CD $ 8 profiles ( upper panel ) and CD44/CD25 profiles within the CD4~/CD8 ~TCR~ population ( Jower panel ) are shown .
we observed a twofold decrease in the most mature , CD44 DN population , in AdCMVmut-I « B-infected thymic lobes relative to those infected with AdCMVB-gal .
This decrease is paralleled by a proportional increase in the CD44 -~CD25 * population that directly precedes it in the thymic development pathway , suggesting a developmental block at the stage where the expression of CD25 is down-regulated .
TCRB expression and proliferation Since the developmental block we observed after AdCMVmut-I « B infection occurs at the same stage as those found in recombinase-activating gene ( RAG ) '- and TCRB '~ mice , which are both unable to express the TCRB gene ( 31-34 ) , we checked whether TCRB was normally expressed in the CD25 *CD44~ DN population .
Intracellular staining for TCRPB revealed that its expression was not decreased in AdCMVmut-IxB-infected CD44 ~CD25¢* DN thymocytes ; 68 + 3 % stained positive for intracellular TCRB compared with 52 + 3 % of those infected with AdCMVB-gal ( Fig .
5 ) .
To check whether the decreased number of cells in the CD25 CD44~ DN population was due to a lower proliferation rate , BrdU was added to the FTOC 18 h before analysis ( day 6 of culture ) .
Fig .

AdCMVmut-IxB-infected FTOC proliferating in the CD44 CD25 * population , while there was no significant difference in proliferation rate in the CD44-CD25~ population .
These data were confirmed by cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide ( Fig .
7 ) .
Apoptosis Because NF- « B was found to play an important role in ensuring the survival of cells ( 35 , 36 ) , we also investigated whether AdCMVmut-IrB-infected thymocytes were more susceptible to apoptotic death than AdCMVB-gal-infected thymocytes .
After 6 days of culture thymocytes were stained with annexin V , a ligand of the phosphatidylserine that is expressed on the surface of apoptotic cells , together with Abs that detect surface markers .
Fig .
8A shows that there was a significant increase in apoptosis , as measured by the proportion of annexin * cells , in the CD44 -CD25~ DN population of AdCMVmut-IxB-infected cells compared with that in the population of AdCMV B-gal-infected cells .
Apoptosis in the CD44~-CD25¢ DN population was also increased , although less so than in the CD44 CD25 DN population .
Similar results were obtained using the TUNEL method ( 37 ) ( Fig .
8B ) .
The higher level of apoptosis-positive cells seen in the TUNEL assay is caused by a longer incubation at 37°C .
In populations containing more mature thymocytes ( DP and SP ) , no significant differences in levels of apoptosis were found ( data not shown ) .
In experiments in which CD44 DN cells were sorted after 6 days of FTOC and subsequently cultured as single cells at 37°C for 18 h , only 2 % of the sorted cells remained alive as judged by uptake of trypan blue , while 12 % 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3460 A B-gal mutl « B 48 % CD25+ o 10° 10 10° 10+ 10 % ou is Events CD25 : P3 Zz ﬂ/ZZ 10° 10 10 10 10+ BrdU Content » % BrdU + B-gal - IxB B-gal _ IxB CD25 FIGURE 6 .

As CD44-CD25* cells are known to down-regulate CD25 within this time frame , these data support the results obtained with the annexin and TUNEL assays .
Discussion Many insights into thymocyte development have been obtained using gene-defective and transgenic mice ( 8 , 38 ) .
Here we report a novel technique in which we use an adenoviral vector to introduce and express genes in developing fetal thymocytes .
Earlier reports as well as our own unpublished results indicated that adult thymocytes and T cells were infected with low efficiency by adenovirus ( 39 ) .
We show that at a multiplicity of infection that does not interfere with normal development , most thymocytes can be infected with recombinant adenovirus in FTOC .
In contrast to ret-roviruses , adenovirus does not require cell division and can be easily obtained in high titers .
Furthermore , no coculture with packaging cells is necessary ( 40 , 41 ) .
This system could thus become an extremely useful tool to study the roles of the various genes expressed during thymocyte development .
Because we use a CMV promoter we can not formally exclude that the effects we saw were NEF- « B IN FETAL THYMOCYTE DEVELOPMENT & $ .

This strongly suggests that the observed effects are intrinsic to the thymocytes and are not due to an effect in trans of the stromal cells .
Our system makes it possible to pinpoint the exact stage in fetal development at which NF- « B is involved , since such critical parameters as the time in development at which NF-KB is inhibited can be rigorously con-trolled , and thymocyte development can be studied in isolation of other organs .
As a result of NF-KB inhibition , we observed a partial block in the maturation of CD4 - CD8~ DN thymocytes between the CD44-CD25¢ and CD44~-CD25~ stages .
A complete block at this stage was also observed in RAG and TCRB knockout mice ( 31-34 ) .
In both , the TCR B-chain can not be rearranged , and cells therefore do not enter the cell cycle due to the inability to form a pre-TCR complex .
In either of these mouse strains , cross-linking of CD3e results in proliferation and transition to the DP stage ( 42 , 43 ) .
In thymocytes infected with AdCMVmut-IrB we have rescued maturation at the CD44 -~CD25 * stage in a similar manner by cross-linking CD3e ( data not shown ) .
In our system , however , TCRB expression appeared to occur normally .
Indeed , a slightly higher percentage of cells at the CD44 -CD25¢~ DN stage expressed intracellular TCR # B protein in the AdCMVmut-IB-infected thymocytes compared with the AdCMV B-gal-infected thy-mocytes , implying that NF- « B is not necessary for expression of TCRB .
Furthermore , the percentage of cycling cells in the CD44 -CD25¢ DN subset was similar in AdCMVmut-IxB-infected thymocytes to that observed in AdCMV B-gal-infected thy-mocytes , suggesting that the pre-TCR complex is functional .
Since NF-KB family members are differentially expressed in the cortical and medullary compartments , it is likely that NF-KB has more than one function in thymocyte development .
Our results could be interpreted as the consequence of two concurrent effects : first , a delayed down-regulation of CD25 , and second , a massive apoptosis in cells .
It is also likely that the function of NF-KB in thymocyte development is not identical in adults or fetuses , as maturation pathways in these two life stages are known to differ ( 3 ) .
Multiple functions for NF- « B could explain the differences between the maturation defects observed in adult IxBa transgenic mice , on the one hand , and in FTOC from the same transgenic mice or from normal mice infected with AdCMVmut-IB , on the other hand .
In the first case , cells develop normally until the DP stage ( 18 ) , whereas in the other two cases perturbation of maturation starts at earlier stages .
Earlier studies indicate that NF- « B plays an important role in regulating apoptosis in different cell types .
In RelA knockout em-bryos , hepatocytes undergo massive apoptosis on day 15 of gestation , and RelA-deficient fibroblasts and macrophages are more sensitive to killing by TNF ( 35 , 36 ) .
It has also been suggested that Rel-related proteins protect B lymphocytes from apoptosis ( 44 ) .
Boothby et al .
found that primary T cells expressing a mutant IxBa are more susceptible to apoptosis induced by stimulation through the TCR , which suggests a protective role for NF-KB ( 19 ) .
Here we show that CD44 DN thymocytes infected with AdCMVmut-IrB are more susceptible to apoptosis than those infected with AdCMV B-gal .
This suggests that NF- « B plays a role in protecting thymocytes from undergoing apoptosis in early stages of development .
It is not yet clear whether the antiapoptotic functions of NF-KB also involve extracellular pathways .
Transferred into normal mice , fetal liver cells deficient for NF- « B1/p50 and RelA were did not undergo any T cell development .
However , when doubly deficient fetal liver cells were mixed with normal fetal liver cells , both the normal liver cells and the deficient liver cells developed normally ( 45 ) .
This suggests that NF-KB can influence thymocyte development by means of an extracellular fac- 3461 tor .
Furthermore , many cytokines are known to be regulated by NF- « B ( 46 ) , while other studies show that defined cytokines are required for proliferation and development at different stages of thymocyte development ( 47 , 48 ) .
It thus seems reasonable to speculate that NF- « B-regulated cytokines may play a role in ensuring the survival of early thymocytes .
Besides cytokines , it is also possible that other intra- or extracellular factors are involved .
Bel-2 , for example , is known to be highly expressed in CD44 -CD25 * thymocytes and has been shown to protect different cell types from undergoing apoptosis ( 49 ) .
Taken together , our data indicate that if NF-KB is kept inactive during early fetal thymocyte development , cells develop normally until the CD44 -CD25 ¢ DN stage .
At this stage , activation of NF-KB is required to convey a signal without which the cells will fail to develop further and will eventually die by apoptosis .
Whether this signal induces the production of intrinsic or extrinsic factors remains to be resolved .
In summary , we have established a novel infection system to express relevant genes in FTOC , allowing a detailed dissection of the complex molecular and cellular interactions implicated in thymic development .
We were able to precisely describe thymic maturation defects that occur when NF-KB is inactivated from day 14 of gestation .
We are currently in the process of generating new adenoviral constructs to study the role of other genes of potential importance in lymphocyte development .
