The functions of NFAT proteins are directly controlled by the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin .
Here we show that the binding of calcineurin to NFAT is substantially increased when calcineurin is activated with calmodulin and calcium .
FK506-FKBP12 drug-immunophilin complexes inhibited the interaction of NFAT with activated calcineurin much more effectively than they inhibited the interaction with inactive calcineurin , suggesting that part of the interaction with activated calcineurin involved the enzyme active site .
We have previously shown that NFAT is targeted to inactive calcineurin at a region distinct from the calcineurin active site ( Aram-buru , J. , Garcia-Cozar , F. J. , Raghavan , A. , Okamura , H. , Rao , A. , and Hogan , P. G. ( 1998 ) Mol .
Cell 1 , 627-637 ) ; this region is also involved in NFAT binding to activated calcineurin , since binding is inhibited by an NFAT peptide spanning the calcineurin docking site on NFAT .
The interacting surfaces are located on the catalytic domain of the calcineurin A chain and on an 86-amino acid fragment of the NFAT regulatory domain .
NFAT binding to the calcineurin catalytic domain was inhibited by the calcineurin autoinhibitory domain and the RII substrate peptide , which bind in the calcineurin active site , as well as by the NFAT docking site peptide , which binds to a region of calcineurin distinct from the active site .
We propose that , in resting cells , NFAT is targeted to a region of the calcineurin catalytic domain that does not overlap the calcineurin active site .
Upon cell activation , displacement of the autoinhibitory domain by calmodulin binding allows NFAT to bind additionally to the calcineurin active site , thus positioning NFAT for immediate dephosphorylation at functional phosphoserine residues .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org Proteins belonging to the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family are a family of transcription factors that regulate the expression of many inducible genes during the immune response ( 1-5 ) ( reviewed in Rao et al .
( 6 ) ) .
NFAT proteins are expressed in a variety of immune system cells as well as in endothelial cells , certain neuronal cells , and other cells outside the immune system ( 6-12 ) .
NFAT proteins contain two adjacent ~300-amino acid regions that are conserved within the NFAT family , a regulatory domain located near the N terminus and a strongly conserved DNA binding domain ( 4-6 , 13-18 ) .
In resting cells , NFAT proteins are phosphorylated and reside in the cytoplasm ; upon stimulation of cells with calcium-mobiliz-ing agents , they become dephosphorylated and translocate rapidly to the nucleus ( 6 , 7 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 19 , 20 ) .
In the nucleus , they interact cooperatively with Fos-Jun proteins and possibly other transcription factors to modulate gene transcription ( 6 , 21-24 ) .
The activity of NFAT transcription factors is directly regulated by calcineurin , a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase also known as protein phosphatase 2B ( 6 , 25 ) .
Calcineurin controls multiple functions of NFAT proteins , including their nuclear import , their DNA-binding affinity , and their transactivation ( reviewed in Rao et al .
( 6 ) ) .
Both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of NFAT1 bind to calcineurin immobilized on calmodulin-Sepharose beads ( 13 , 26 ) .
The binding has been mapped to the N-terminal regulatory domains of NFAT proteins using recombinant NFAT1 and NFAT2 expressed in bacteria ( 15 , 27 ) , as well as recombinant NFAT and NFAT4 expressed in mammalian cells ( 13 , 16 , 17 , 26 ) .
Calcineurin is a heterodimer of a catalytic A subunit and a calcium-binding regulatory B subunit ( 25 ) .
The A subunit contains the catalytic domain at its N terminus , followed by binding regions for the B subunit and for calmodulin that were defined by deletion and mutational analysis ( 28-31 ) .
An autoinhibitory domain , whose removal renders calcineurin constitutively active , is located near the C terminus of the calcineurin A chain ( 29-31 ) .
Determination of the calcineurin structure showed that the autoinhibitory domain forms an « -helix that is positioned in the active site of the calcineurin catalytic domain , thus preventing the access of substrates to the active site ( 32 ) .
Both in human and in bovine calcineurin , the B-chain binding region is also a-helical ( 32 , 33 ) , while the region between the B-chain-binding helix and the autoinhibitory domain is disordered in the crystal structure ( 32 ) .
Calmodulin binding to this disordered region is presumed to displace the autoinhibitory domain from the calcineurin active site , thus permitting the access of substrates to the active site .

Calmodulin enhances the A B binding of calcineurin to NFAT .
'*I- Calcineurin ( Cr ) ( 4 nM ) was incubated with GST-NFAT2 or GST-LSF in the $ 0 presence or absence of calcium and/or calmodulin ( CaM ) as indicated .
Reactions lacking calcium contained 5 mM EGTA .
The beads were rapidly washed by filtration to remove unbound calcineurin , and bound radioactivity was quantified .
Reactions lacking calmodulin contained an equivalent concentration ( 500 nM ) of myo-globin .
In A , the average and standard deviation of a representative experiment , performed in triplicate , is shown .
Note that error bars for some triplicates are too small to be apparent .
In B , a second experiment using a different calcineurin preparation , with a greater calmodulin-dependent increase in binding , is shown .
0 Ca++ CaM a & I fmol I-Cn bound The clinically important immunosuppressive drugs , cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 , have long been known to inhibit T lymphocyte activation and NFAT activation , primarily because of their ability to inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin toward phosphoprotein substrates ( reviewed in Refs .
34-37 ) .
CsA and FK506 do not inhibit calcineurin activity directly , but form inhibitory complexes with intracellular receptors , known as immunophilins , that are present at high abundance in all cells ; the immunophilin receptors for CsA are known as cyclo-philins ( CyPs ) , while those for FK506 are known as FK-binding proteins or FKBPs .
The structures of human and bovine calcineurin , in complex with FK506-FKBP12 , have been solved : the drug-immunophilin complex binds to the calcineurin B-binding a-helix of the calcineurin A chain and inhibits calcineurin by an indirect mechanism ( 32 , 33 ) .
Here we show that NFAT proteins interact more strongly with calmodulin-activated than inactive calcineurin .
Two regions of calcineurin are implicated in the interaction , both of which are located on the calcineurin catalytic domain .
One of these is a targeting region complementary to a region we have recently defined as the docking site for calcineurin on NFAT ( 27 ) , while the second is a region overlapping the active site that is preferentially exposed in activated calmodulin-bound calcineurin .
Based on our data , we suggest that NFAT proteins are targeted to calcineurin in resting cells , and that they make an additional interaction with the active site of calcineurin in activated cells .
Our results have implications for the regulation of NFAT by calcineurin in resting and activated cells , and for the development of new types of immunosuppressive drugs .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Reagents-The glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins GST-LSF , GST-human ( h ) NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) , GST-hNFAT2 ( 1-418 ) , and GST-hNFAT4 ( 11-419 ) ( abbreviated GST-NFAT1 , GST-NFAT2 , and so forth ) have been described ( 27 , 38 ) .
The hexahistidine-tagged NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) was generated by subcloning the coding region for the 415 N-terminal amino acids of NFAT1 into the pQE32 vector ( Qiagen ) .
Hexahistidine-tagged NFAT1 truncation mutants were generated by a polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pQE vectors ( Qiagen ) .
Recombinant bacterially expressed human calcineurin and human FKBP12 were prepared as described previously ( 82 ) .
The recombinant catalytic domain of human calcineurin ( CnCAT ) , incorporating a hexa-histidine tag at the C terminus , was made by expressing amino acids 1-847 in bacteria .

Cyclophilin A ( CyPA ) was kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Walsh ( Harvard Medical School ) .
Bovine calcineurin , calmodulin , and myoglobin were obtained from Sigma .
The RII peptide ( DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE ) ( 40 ) , the calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide ( YITSFEEAKGLDRINERMPPRRDAMPSD ) ( 81 ) , the control ovalbumin peptide ( 41 ) , and the SPRIEIT-25 ( KPAGASGP-SPRIEITPSHELMQAGGY ) , SPRIEIT-13 ( SGPSPRIEITPSH ) , and SPAIAIA-25 ( KPAGASGPSPAIAIAPSHELMQAGGY ) peptides from murine NFAT1 ( 27 ) were synthesized at the Tufts-New England Medical Center Peptide Synthesis Facility .
For some experiments the RII peptide was purchased from Bachem Fine Chemicals , Switzerland .
The polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against the autoinhibitory peptide has been described ( 13 ) .
Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem .
lodination of Calcineurin-Calcineurin or the calcineurin catalytic domain ( CnCat ) ( ~100 ug ) was iodinated with 1 mCi carrier-free Na `` `` I ( NEN Life Science Products ) using IODO-BEADs ( Pierce ) , then separated from free Na `` `` I on a Sephadex G-25 spin column Biospin 6 ( Bio-Rad ) and stored in aliquots at -80 °C .
Specific activities ranged from 150 to 600 cpm/fmol .
Identical results were obtained whether recombinant human calcineurin or bovine calcineurin ( Sigma ) were used in the binding assay .
Binding Assays-In some experiments , calcineurin binding to GST proteins was assessed by Western blotting as described previously ( 18 , 15 ) .
For '**I-calcineurin binding to GST fusion proteins , equivalent amounts of GST-NFAT or GST-LSF fusion proteins were immobilized on gluthathione-Sepharose beads by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C in binding buffer ( 50 mM Tris phosphate , pH 8.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl , , 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol , 1 % Triton X-100 , supplemented with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 20 uM leupeptin , 10 ug/ml aprotinin , and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) .
Beads were washed , resuspended in binding buffer , and incubated with '* % I-calcineurin for 30 min at 4 °C .
Binding of calcineurin to hexahistidine-tagged NFAT proteins was assessed after binding them to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads ( Qia-gen ) ; in these experiments 30 mM imidazole was added to the binding reaction and to the washes to prevent nonspecific binding of calcineurin to the nickel beads .
Background binding of calcineurin to the nickel beads is shown in all such experiments .
Final concentrations of 200 uM CaCl , , 5 mM EGTA , and 500 nM calmodulin were used unless otherwise noted .
Where indicated , CsA-CyPA and FK506FKBP12 complexes , formed by incubation of equimolar concentrations ( 40-400 pM ) of the drugs with the immunophilins for 1 h on ice , were added at the indicated final concentrations to the binding reaction .
The RII , autoinhibi-tory , and control peptides were used at final concentrations of 200 uM .
SPRIEIT and SPAIAIA peptides were used at the indicated final con centrations .

through a 5-um hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride filter ( Millipore ) using a vacuum manifold ( Millipore ) to separate bound and unbound *I-calcineurin .
Filters were washed rapidly under continuous suction with 24 ml of 50 mM Hepes , pH 7.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mm MgCl , , 200 um CaCl , , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X-100 .
Washed filters were transferred to tubes and **I-calcineurin retained by the immobilized GST or hexahistidine-tagged proteins was quantified in a Hewlett Packard Gammacounter .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Activated Calcineurin Binds More Strongly than Does Inactive Calcineurin to NFAT-We measured the binding of **°I-calcineurin to GST fusion proteins containing the first 415 and 418 amino acids of NFAT1 and NFAT2 , respectively .
We have previously shown that these N-terminal regions of NFAT proteins are sufficient for calcineurin binding ( 13 , 15 , 27 ) .
'*°I-Calcineurin was incubated with GST-NFAT1 or GST-NFAT2 immobilized on glutathione beads , and radioactivity bound to the beads was rapidly separated by filtration .
Preliminary experiments ( not shown ) indicated that peak levels of ** `` T-cal-cineurin binding were attained by 30 min , and that binding was linear with the amount of GST-NFAT protein used .
Using this assay , we showed that the binding of ** `` T-cal-cineurin to NFAT1 and NFAT2 was markedly dependent on the presence of calcium and calmodulin ( Fig .
1 ) .
In the absence of calcium ( i.e .
in buffer containing 5 mm EGTA ) , a low but significant level of binding was observed ( Fig .
14 , open bars ) .
Note that this low level of binding had not previously been detected by Western blotting ( 13 , 15 ) , confirming that the binding assay using iodinated calcineurin was significantly more sensitive .
In the presence of 100 uM calcium , there was a substantial increase in calcineurin binding to NFAT1l ( not shown ) and NFAT2 ( Fig .
1 , A and B , gray bars ) , consistent with our earlier results using Western blot analysis ( 13 , 15 ) .
When calmodulin was included in the binding reaction , the level of binding was again reproducibly increased , by a further 2-5-fold depending on the batch of iodinated calcineurin ( Fig .
1 , A and B , hatched bars ) .
As expected from the known calcium requirement for calmodulin to bind and activate calcineurin , calmodulin had no effect on the NFAT-calcineurin association in the absence of calcium ( Fig .
14 , black bars ) .
Neither calcium nor calmodulin had any effect on the background binding of calcineurin to the unrelated DNA-binding protein LSF ( Fig .
14 , right ) , emphasizing the specificity of the NFAT-calcineurin association .
Identification of a Short Fragment of NFAT1 That Binds to Calcineurin-To determine the region of NFAT1 involved in binding calcineurin , we tested a series of systematic trunca-tions of the NFAT1 regulatory domain , expressed as hexahistidine-tagged proteins in bacteria .
These experiments identified an 86-amino acid fragment , NFAT1 ( 97-183 ) , which bound calcineurin as effectively as the original NFAT1 ( 1-415 ) recombinant protein ( Fig .
2 ) .
A shorter fragment , NFATI1 ( Q7-144 ) , was also able to bind calcineurin in a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent fashion , but binding was decreased by comparison with NFAT1 ( I-415 ) or NFAT1 ( 97-183 ) .
These results indicate that the 86-amino acid fragment , NFAT ( 97-183 ) , contains the region of NFAT involved in calcineurin interaction .
This fragment contains the sequence `` °SPRIEITPS `` '® , which we have recently shown represents a docking site for calcineurin on NFAT1 ( 27 ) .
Indeed the docking sequence is present in both short NFAT1 fragments , ( 97-144 ) and ( 97-183 ) , that are capable of binding to calcineurin , but absent in NFAT1 ( 1-96 ) and ( 140-415 ) , which show little or no calcineurin binding , confirming that the docking sequence makes a major contribution to the NFAT-calcineurin interac- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 23880 Interaction of Calcineurin with NFAT ++ .

tion and that regions outside the 87-amino acid fragment NFAT1 ( 97-183 ) do not interact effectively with calcineurin .
NFAT Binds the Calcineurin Catalytic Domain-To define the region of calcineurin involved in NFAT binding , we generated a recombinant calcineurin containing only the catalytic domain ( residues 1-347 ) of human calcineurin A ( CnCAT ) .
Despite lacking the calcineurin B-binding helix , the calmodu-lin-binding region and the autoinhibitory domain , this protein showed substantial binding to NFAT ( Fig .
3 ) .
Binding of ** `` I-CnCAT to GST-NFAT was equivalent in the presence and absence of calcium ( Fig .
34 ) , consistent with the expectation that CnCAT should not need calcium or the calcineurin B chain to assume a stable protein conformation .
Binding of '* `` I-CnCAT to GST-NFAT was also equivalent in the presence and absence of calmodulin ( Fig .
3B ) , consistent with the fact that CnCAT lacks the autoinhibitory region and the calmodulin-binding domain .
Finally , binding of **°I-CnrCAT to GST-NFAT proteins was unaffected by drug-immunophilin complexes ( Fig .
3C ) , which are not expected to bind CnCAT since they bind to the CnB-binding helix of the calcineurin A-calcineurin B het-erodimer , which is lacking in CnCAT .
The use of inhibitory peptides defined two distinct regions for NFAT interaction with the calcineurin catalytic domain .
The RII substrate peptide and the calcineurin autoinhibitory domain peptide , both of which bind to the calcineurin active site in their unphosphorylated forms , caused significant but partial inhibition of CnCAT binding to NFAT , indicating that at least part of the binding involved a region close to the calcineurin active site ( Fig .
3D ) .
Additionally , binding was inhibited by the SPRIEIT-25 peptide spanning the calcineurin docking site of NFAT1 ( Fig .
36 ) , indicating that the complementary surface on calcineurin that interacts with the NFAT SPRIEIT sequence is present within the calcineurin catalytic domain .
Because the SPRIEIT peptides do not inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity ( 27 ) , the docking region for NFAT on calcineurin is distinct from the calcineurin active site .
Thus NFAT binding to the calcineurin catalytic domain involves at least two regions , the docking site on NFAT that was first defined using inactive calcineurin ( 27 ) , and a region overlapping the calcineurin active site that is constitutively exposed in the calcineurin catalytic domain .
In the following sections we show that these same regions are involved in the interaction of NFAT with calmod- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog Interaction of Calcineurin with NFAT 23881 A NFAT 200 150 SPRIEIT-25 -B-SPRIEIT-13 -G-E 100 SPAIAIA-25 -o-Fig .

Peptides Spanning the NFAT Docking Sequence Inhibit the Binding of Activated Calcineurin to NFAT-The SPAIATA mutation in the SPRIEIT docking sequence ( R112A , Ell4A , T116A ) impaired not only the basal binding of NFAT1 to inactive calcineurin in the absence of calmodulin ( 27 ) , but also the calmodulin-dependent binding of activated calcineurin to NFAT ( Fig .
4A ) .
Moreover the peptides SPRIEIT-25 and SPRIEIT-13 spanning 25 and 13 residues of this docking sequence competed the binding of activated calcineurin to NFATI ( I-415 ) , whereas the peptide SPAIAIA-25 , which incorporated the inactivating mutations , did not ( Fig .
44 ) .
The concentration of SPRIEIT peptides required for half-maximal inhibition of the binding of activated calcineurin to was ~25 un ( Fig .
4A ) , compared with the ~12 uM required for half-maximal inhibition of the binding of inactive calcineurin to NFAT ( 27 ) .
The binding of activated calcineurin to NFAT2 and NFAT4 was also inhibited by the SPRIEIT peptides ( Fig .
4B ) with an IC ; 5 , of ~50 uM , again a higher concentration than necessary to inhibit the binding of inactive calcineurin to these proteins ( IC ; , of ~25 um ) ( 27 ) .
SPRIEIT peptides were also able to inhibit binding of active and inactive calcineurin to the short NFAT1 fragment ( 97-183 ) ( data not shown ) .
Drug-Immunophilin Complexes Partially Inhibit the Binding of Activated Calcineurin to NFAT-To determine whether NFAT binding to active calcineurin involved the calcineurin active site , we tested the effect of FK506-FKBP12 complexes on the binding of active ( calmodulin-dependent ) and inactive calcineurin to NFAT1 ( 97-183 ) .
In both cases binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the drug-immunophilin complexes , but the extent of inhibition was much greater in the case of active compared with inactive calcineurin ( ~80 % versus ~50 % inhibition at 10 um FK506GFKBP12 ) ( Fig .

The phosphatase activity of calcineurin is not required for binding to NFAT .
The binding of recombinant wild-type ( W¢ ) calcineurin or the catalytically inactive His `` - > Ala mutant ( H151A ) to GST-NFAT2 in the presence or absence of calmodulin was assessed by Western blotting .
centrations of FK506-FKBP12 were required to achieve equivalent inhibition of inactive versus active calcineurin ( .e .
0.1 uM FK506-FKBP12 sufficed to inhibit binding of active calcineurin by 30 % , whereas 1 um FK506 : FKBP12 was required for equivalent inhibition of binding of inactive calcineurin to NFAT ; compare Fig .
5 , A and B ) .
The immunophilins CyPA and FKBP12 had no effect on the NFAT-calcineurin in the absence of the relevant immunosupressive drugs ( data not shown ) .
The Catalytic Activity of Calcineurin Is Not Required for NFAT-Calcineurin Binding-Since the previous experiments implicated the calcineurin active site in NFAT-calcineurin binding , we asked whether the catalytic activity of calcineurin was required for binding to NFAT proteins ( Fig .
6 ) .
Recombinant wild-type calcineurin or the inactive His `` - Ala mutant were incubated with GST-NFAT2 in the presence or absence of calmodulin .
The beads were then washed and the amount of bound calcineurin was assessed by Western blotting with an antibody to the autoinhibitory peptide of calcineurin A , exactly as described previously ( 15 ) .
Fig .
5 shows that there was equivalent binding of the catalytically active and inactive calcineurin to NFAT , indicating that the NFAT-calcineurin interaction does not require the phosphatase activity of calcineurin .
Consistent with this result , catalytically inactive calcineurins , when overexpressed , inhibited the nuclear import of NFAT4 ( 16 ) , indicating that these proteins remained capable of interaction with NFAT .
Characteristics of the NFAT-Calcineurin Interaction-The NFAT-calcineurin interaction is central to the proper regulation of the immune response ( 6 , 35 ) , and also plays a role in the function of cells and tissues outside the immune system ( 11 , 12 ) .
We show here that calmodulin-activated calcineurin binds significantly more strongly than does inactive calcineurin to NFAT .
The interacting regions are located on the catalytic domain of the calcineurin A chain and on an 86-amino acid fragment of the NFAT regulatory domain .
Our results suggest that the interaction of activated calcineurin with NFAT involves at least two functionally separable regions .
One of these is the SPRIEIT sequence of NFAT1 , which we have previously identified as the docking site for inactive calcineurin in resting cells ( 27 ) , while the second involves the enzyme active site .
The active site interaction is inhibited by the calcineurin autoinhibitory domain and the RII substrate peptide , which bind in the active site , as well as by drug-immunophilin complexes that partially occlude the active site .
The active site contact appears to make a substantially stronger contribution to the NFAT-calcineurin interaction under stimulatory conditions , when the calcineurin has been activated with calcium and calmodulin .
These results shed light on previous findings in which calcineurin was shown to coprecipitate with NFAT4 in cell lysates only after activation of the cells ( 16 ) .
It is likely that the Western blotting assay used was insensitive and permitted detection of the NFAT4-calcineurin interaction only under conditions of calcineurin activation .
In other work , cells were not previously activated , but coprecipitation of NFAT and calcineurin was assessed using calcineurin bound to calmodulin beads ( 13 , 26 ) , or in the presence of calcium concentrations that Interaction of Calcineurin with NFAT allowed activation by calmodulin in the cell lysates ( 17 ) .
Given the fact that activated ( dephosphorylated ) as well as inactive ( phosphorylated ) NFAT bind equivalently to calcineurin ( 13 , 26 ) , the increased binding seen under conditions of cell activation reflects the significant increase in NFAT binding to calcineurin in the activated state .
Analysis of deletion mutants of NFAT4 suggested that NFAT possessed multiple regions of interaction with calcineurin ( 17 ) .
In contrast , our data with both NFAT1 and NFAT4 emphasize the importance of the SPRIEIT docking sequence in the NFAT-calcineurin interaction , and point to a major involvement of the ( 97-183 ) fragment of NFAT1 .
Nevertheless the truncation mutants NFAT1 ( I1-96 ) and NFATI1 ( 140-415 ) showed weak calmodulin-dependent binding to calcineurin , suggesting that regions outside the SPRIEIT sequence and the ( 97-183 ) region might contribute to calcineurin binding .
This may be particularly true for NFAT4 .
Based on our data , we propose a model for the interaction of calcineurin with NFAT proteins in resting and activated cells .
We suggest that NFAT is targeted to inactive calcineurin via the SPRIEIT docking sequence ( and possibly other regions within the ( 97-183 ) NFAT1 fragment ) .
This targeting interaction involves a region of the calcineurin catalytic domain that does not overlap the calcineurin active site and ensures the proximity of the enzyme to its substrate in resting cells .
Upon cell activation , displacement of the autoinhibitory domain of calcineurin by calmodulin allows NFAT to bind additionally to the calcineurin active site , positioning specific regulatory phosphoserine residues of NFAT for immediate dephosphorylation .
Further analysis of this dynamic interaction will facilitate our understanding of how calcineurin regulates NFAT-mediated gene transcription .
Moreover it may speed the development of new immunosuppressive drugs that block the NFAT-calcineurin interaction but lack the deleterious site effects of cyclosporin A and FK506 .
