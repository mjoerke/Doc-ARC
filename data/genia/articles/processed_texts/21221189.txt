Hypoxia inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) is a constitutively expressed basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor , formed by the assembly of HIF-1 « and HIF-1B ( Arnt ) , that is stab-lized in response to hypoxia , and rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions .
It activates the transcription of genes important for maintaining oxygen homeostasis .
Here , we demonstrate that engineered down-regulation of HIF-1 « by intratumoral gene transfer of an antisense HIF-1 « plasmid leads to the down-regulation of VEGF , and decreased tumor microvessel density .
Antisense HIF-1 « - monotherapy resulted in the complete and permanent rejection of small ( 0.1 cm in diameter ) EL-4 tumors , which is unusual for an anti-angiogenic agent where transient suppression of tumor growth is the norm .
It induced NK cell-dependent rejection of tumors , but failed to stimulate systemic T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity , and synergized with B7-1-mediated immunotherapy to cause the NK cell and CD8 T cell-dependent rejection of larger EL-4 tumors ( 0.4 cm in diameter ) that were refractory to monotherapies .
Mice cured of their tumors by combination therapy resisted a rechallenge with parental tumor cells , indicating systemic antitumor immunity had been achieved .
In summary , whilst intensive investigations are in progress to target the many HIF-1 effectors , the results herein indicate that blocking hypoxia-inducible pathways and enhancing NK-mediated antitumor immunity by targeting HIF-1 itself may be advantageous , especially when combined with cancer immunotherapy .

How they sense hypoxia , and respond by activating hypoxia-inducible genes and secreting angiogenic factors to establish a blood system is central to cancer biology , the answers to which will provide new strategies for cancer treatment . ``
'' Many tumors contain hypoxic microen-vironments , which have been associated with malignant progression , poor prognosis , metastasis and resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy .

`` ** HIF-1 , which is formed by the assembly of HIF-1 « and HIF-1B ( Arnt ) during binds hypoxia-response elements ( HREs ) in enhancers of genes encoding angiogenic factors such as VEGF , and glycoly-sis-related proteins such as glycolytic enzymes , and glucose transporters 1 and 3 ( Glut-1 and 3 ) .
The latter Correspondence : GW Krissansen , Department of Molecular Medicine , School of Medicine and Health Science , University of Auckland , Auckland , New Zealand Received 5 July 2000 ; accepted 22 November 2000 proteins are required for the high glycolytic rates of cancer cells , and hence are important for the bioenergetics of tumor growth .
HIF-l1a « -deficiency is embryonically lethal resulting from impaired vascularization . ``
Embryonic stem cells lacking HIF-1 « are unable to up-regulate several HIF-1 target genes under hypoxic or low glucose conditions , in particular enzymes in the glycolytic path-way . ``
'' Loss of HIF-l « results in reduced hypoxia-inducible expression of VEGF , failure to form new blood vessels , and retardation of solid tumor growth , `` `` and conversely overexpression correlates with tumor growth . ``
'' HIF-1 « is overexpressed in many tumor types compared with respective normal tissues , including colon , breast , gastric , lung , skin , ovarian , pancreatic , prostate and renal carcinomas . ``
'' Whereas HIF-1 $ B is constitutively expressed , HIF-l « is rapidly degraded during normoxia by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway , and dramatically stabilized and activated following hypoxia , by an oxygen-sensing and signalling process that remains an enigma . ``
HIF-l « associates with pVHL ( von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein ) , `` `` `` `` and heat shock protein 90 that determine its fate .
pVHL targets hypoxia-inducible factors including HIF-l1 « for oxygen-dependent proteo-lysis , and destabilizes VEGF and other hypoxically regu- lated mRNAs . ``
In VHL-defective cells , HIF-l « is constitutively stabilized and activated , `` resulting in inherited hypervascular tumors . ``
Downstream effectors of HIF-1 , in particular VEGF , have been intensively investigated as targets for the treatment of solid vascular tumors , with some degree of suc-cess .
Thus inhibition of VEGF expression in tumor xenografts leads to vascular regression , and decreased tumor growth .
`` * `` `` We reasoned that the simplest means of inhibiting HIF-1 effectors responsible for tumor growth , would be to target HIF-1 itself .
Here we demonstrate that HIF-l « is a suitable target to attack the tumor vasculature .
To date , the long-held promise of cancer immunotherapy has not been realized .
We propose that cancer immunotherapy can be made more effective by simultaneously targeting a tumour 's weapons of survival , defense and attack .
We have previously shown that an attack on the tumor vasculature combined with B7-1 immunotherapy , which costimulates antitumor T cells and generates systemic antitumor immunity , overcomes the immune-resistance of large tumors . ``
Here we reveal that anti-HIF-la therapy greatly enhances the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy involving gene transfer of the T cell costimulator B7-1 into tumors in sity . ``
Results Gene transfer of an expression plasmid encoding antisense HIF-1 « induces the rejection of established tumors EL-4 tumors of 0.1 cm in diameter were established in C57BL/6 mice , and injected with a DNA /liposome transfection vehicle containing 100 ug of antisense HIF-l « peDNA3B plasmid DNA .
Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections prepared 2 days following gene transfer , revealed antisense therapy resulted in almost the complete inhibition of HIF-1a « expressed endogenously in growing tumors ( Figure 1 , compare c and d ) .
Down-regulation of HIF-l1 « expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis of tumor homogenates ( Figure 1i ) .
Tumor growth was monitored for 4 weeks following gene transfer ( Figure ?
a ) .
A comparison was made with mice treated with 100 ug of empty vector control , and vector encoding the T cell costimulator B7-1 as a positive con-trol . ``
Tumors grew rapidly in the control group , reaching 1 cm in size 14-17 days following gene transfer , whereas tumors treated with the antisense HIF-1 « plasmid and B7-1 completely and rapidly regressed within 1 week of gene transfer .
Mice remained tumor-free for a further 21-day period during which they were moni-tored .
There was no significant difference between the growth pattern of tumors treated with B7-1 and antisense HIF-l1 « ( P > 0.05 ) .
However , when antisense HIF-l « -treated , tumor-free , mice were rechallenged with 1 x 10° parental EL-4 cells , palpable tumors appeared 15-20 days later in all the mice ( Table 1 ) .
In contrast , no tumors emerged over a monitoring period of 2 months in mice that had cleared their tumors in response to B7-1 immunotherapy .
Antisense HIF-1 « therapy does not eradicate large tumors , but slows their growth We have previously demonstrated that tumors become refractory to B7-1-mediated immunotherapy once they Antisense HIF-1 « enhances cancer immunotherapy X Sun et al [ i ) a 120 kDa > | U # % * HIF-l1a VEGF Figure 1 Immunohistochemistry of tumor sections following gene transfer of the T cell costimulator B7-1 , and an anti-angiogenic plasmid encoding antisense HIF-1 @ « .

The sizes ( cm ) of tumors were recorded following gene transfer .
Complete tumor regression is denoted by vertical arrows .
Mice were killed if tumors reached more than 1 cm in diameter ( denoted by stars ) .
Cured mice were rechallenged with 1x 10° parental tumor cells .
No tumors developed in mice cured by B7-1 therapy , whereas all mice treated by antisense HIF-1 « therapy developed tumors during the 2 months they were monitored ( refer to Table 1 ) .
Table 1 Rechallenge of cured mice with parental tumour cells reach 0.3 cm in diameter . ``
This is shown in Figure 2b where large tumors ( 0.4 cm diameter ) were refractory to B7-1 immunotherapy .
The failure of B7-1 therapy to combat large tumors is not the result of poor transfection efficiency as B7-1 gene transfer led to expression of B7-1 in 90 % of tumor cells ( Figure 1 , compare a and b ) , as reported previously . ``
To determine whether antisense HIF-l1 « therapy was similarly ineffective against large tumors , EL-4 tumors of 0.4 cm in diameter were estab-lished , and treated with 100 pg antisense HIF-l « expression plasmid .
As shown in Figure 2b , none of the mice rejected their tumors , albeit there was a significant ( P < 0.01 ) inhibition of tumor growth , similar to that observed with B7-1 therapy .
All tumors eventually reached 1 cm in diameter within 2 weeks , and mice had to be killed .
Vascular attack by antisense HIF-1 « synergizes with B7-1 immunotherapy to eradicate large tumors We have previously reported `` that an attack on tumor blood vessels by the flavone acetic acid-related agent 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid ( DMXAA ) in combination with B7.1-mediated immunotherapy overcomes immune-resistance and leads to the eradication of large tumors .
Here we consider the possibility that an anti-HIF-la reagent might be a suitable anti-angiogenic substitute for DMXAA in combination therapy , given the toxicity of DMXAA at high therapeutic doses . ``
'' `` For combination therapy , 0.4 cm diameter tumors were first injected with DNA complexes containing 100 ug B7-1 , followed 48 h later by 100 pg antisense HIF-l1 « plasmids .
Timed delivery of anti-angiogenic and immunothera-peutic agents has previously proven to be critical to the success of combinational therapy . ``
'' Combined gene therapy led to complete tumor regression within 10 days , and mice remained tumor-free for 3 weeks ( Figure 3 ) .
To determine whether systemic antitumor immunity had been generated , cured mice were rechallenged with 1 x 10° parental tumor cells .
Such mice resisted the chal-lenge , and remained tumor-free for at least 2 months ( Table 1 ) , indicating an antitumor immune memory response had been generated .
As a control , B7-1 immunotherapy was combined with an expression plasmid encoding the HIF-l1 « cDNA fragment inserted into pecDNA3 in a sense orientation .
In marked contrast to the above results , sense HIF-1 « could not enhance the therapeutic efficacy of B7-1 ( Figure 3 ) , producing results that were not statistically ( P > 0.05 ) different from mice treated with B7-1 alone .

Composition of the effector cell population We have previously demonstrated that NK cells and CD8+* T cells are largely responsible for B7-1-mediated antitumor immunity . ``
NK cells , and CD8* and CD4* T cells are responsible for antitumor immunity generated by combination therapy with antisense HIF-1 « and B7-1 ( Figure 4 ) .
In contrast , NK cells are solely responsible for the antitumor effects of anti-sense HIF-1 « monotherapy , and T cells appear not to be involved .
Antisense HIF-1 « therapy inhibits VEGF expression , and reduces the density of tumor blood vessels Given that antisense HIF-l « down-regulated the expression of HIF-1 « in EL-4 tumor cells , we sought to determine whether the expression of downstream effectors such as VEGF was abolished .
Expression of VEGF was specifically reduced in response to antisense HIF-1 « , as determined by immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections ( Figure 1 , compare e and £ ) , and Western blot analysis of tumor homogenates ( Figure 1j ) , resulting in a statistically significant ( P < 0.01 ) 30 % reduction in tumor vessel density ( Figure 1 , compare g and h ; Figure 5a ) , compared with mock treatment with empty vector .
The median and 90th centile distances to the nearest anti-CD31 mAb-labelled venules from an array of points within tumors treated with antisense HIF-l1 « were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) longer than those in tumors treated with empty vector ( Figure 5b ) .
Tumor blood vessels present after antisense HIF-l1 « therapy were small and poorly formed ( Figure 1 , compare g and h ) .
Discussion Strategies that target HIF-1 have therapeutic potential in treating cancer The impetus for the present study stemmed from a previous report in which we demonstrated that immune Antisense HIF-1 « enhances cancer immunotherapy X Sun et al a 1.4 641 = , ion | WO D CD4+ T cell deplet 912 + T cell depletion S7 D H 1 { B14 D N | 021 D o 0.8 m 0.6 ; © .

Mice were treated with anti-CD4 ( GK1.5 ) , anti-CD8 ( 53-6.72 ) , and anti-NK cell ( PK136 ) mAbs 4 days before gene transfer , and every alternate day for the duration of the experiment .
The size ( cm ) of tumors was monitored for 21 days following gene transfer .
Anti-CD8 and anti-NK mAbs almost completely abrogated tumor rejection in response to B7-1 , and combination B7-1/antisense HIF-1 « therapy , whereas the efficacy of anti-sense HIF-1 « monotherapy was dependent on NK cells .
resistance of tumors can be overcome by combining B7-1 immunotherapy with a concerted attack on the tumor vasculature delivered by the drug 5,6-dimethylxan-thenone-4-acetic acid ( DMXAA ) .
`` ° In the present study we sought to determine whether anti-HIF-la « reagents would be suitable substitutes for DMXAA in combination with B7-l-mediated immunotherapy , given the high toxicity of DMXAA .
Here we have demonstrated for the first time that gene transfer of antisense HIF-l « vectors into established tumors is able to cause the complete regression of small tumors .
While tumors did not reappear for 3 weeks after complete regression , we can not discount the possibility that they had regressed to microscopic dormant nodules , rather than being completely eradicated , as occurs with repeated anti-angiogenic therapy employing angiostatin®* and endostatin . ``

antisense HIF-1 « is unusual for an anti-angiogenic agent , given that such agents normally cause only transient tumor regression .
By some unknown mechanism , anti-HIF-l « therapy appears to render tumors susceptible to an attack by NK cells , yet it does not stimulate T cell-mediated antitumor immunity , as does B7-1 .
Since different angiogenic factors either promote or inhibit NK cell adhesion to endothelium , `` * it is possible that antisense HIF-l « therapy shifts the balance in favor of NK cell adhesion to tumor microvessels , and thereby facilitates the access of NK cells to the tumor .
Thus the efficacy of antisense HIF-1 « therapy may arise both from an attack Gene Therapy on the tumor vasculature , and enhancement of NK cell-mediated immunity .
Anti-sense HIF-l « therapy could not cause regression of large ( 0.4 em diameter ) tumors , but it did delay tumor growth .
Similarly , we have consistently found that gene transfer of T cell costimulatory integrin ligands , and B7 molecules , into tumors less than 0.3 cm in diameter causes rapid tumor rejection , whereas tumors become increasingly refractory to treatment as their size increases . ``
'' Larger tumors appear to actively suppress or avoid the immune response .
Our results confirm that immunotherapy employing B7-1 and other CAMs has limited therapeutic use , unless their therapeutic efficacy is improved by combination with other therapeutic modalities .
Antisense HIF-1 « enhances B7-1-mediated immunotherapy The data demonstrate that antisense HIF-l1 « and B7-1-immunotherapies synergize in causing the rapid rejection of large EL-4 tumors , and generation of potent antitumor systemic immunity ; thereby establishing that anti-HIF reagents can substitute for DMXAA as an antivascular agent .
Cured mice rechallenged with live EL-4 cells remained tumor-free for at least 3 months .
As reported previously , `` timed delivery of the reagents , where B7-1 vectors are administered first , followed by antisense HIF-1a vectors proved to be effective .
Antisense HIF-l « may facilitate B7-1 immunotherapy by inhibiting tumor cell growth , thereby preventing the outgrowth of escape vari-ants ; by rendering tumors susceptible to NK cell attack ; and by rendering the tumor accessible to T cells as the tumor begins to disintegrate .
Antisense HIF-1 « downregulates VEGF expression , and reduces vessel density HIF-1a « expression was detectable throughout tumors 0.4 cm in diameter , and was almost completely abrogated by antisense HIF-l1 « therapy .
HIF-1 contributes to the activation of an array of hypoxia-regulated genes including those for VEGF , erythropoietin , and those of the glycolytic pathway including lactate dehydrogenase A , pyruv-ate kinase M , enolase 1 , phosphoglycerate kinase 1 , aldolase A , phosphofructokinase L , and glucose transporter-1 .

4 We analyzed VEGF expression to determine whether the activation of HIF-1-dependent gene expression was also abolished by antisense HIF-l « therapy .
VEGF is a potent endothelial mitogen and permeability factor , commonly expressed in tumors , and has been implicated in both physiologically and pathologically occurring angiogenesis . ``
A critical role for VEGF in tumor growth has been suggested by the inhibition of VEGF-induced tumor growth by blocking antibodies , * by administration of antisense VEGF mRNAs , * `` and by a retrovirus encoding a soluble mutant form of the VEGF receptor . ``
Gene transfer of antisense HIF-1 « down-regulated the expression of VEGF , and inhibited the formation of new blood vessels , as shown by a reduction in blood vessel density .
Blood vessels in control tumors appeared larger and more mature than those in tumors treated with antisense HIF-la « , suggesting that blockade of HIF-1 also impairs the maturation and/or patency of blood vessels .
Although HIF-1 is arguably the most important signalling pathway for tumor survival under hypoxia , other pathways are also activated by oncogenes or stress .
Combination therapy that combines a vascular attack with immunotherapy , and simultaneously targets other tumor survival pathways will be the focus of future investi-gations .
Material and methods Mice and cell lines Male C57BL/6 mice , 6-8 weeks old , were obtained from the Animal Resource Unit , Faculty of Medicine and Health Science , University of Auckland , Auckland , New Zealand .
The EL-4 thymic T cell lymphoma , which is of C57BL/6 ( H-2b ) origin , was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD , USA ) .
It was cultured at 37°C in DMEM medium ( Gibco BRL , Grand Island , NY , USA ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 50 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin , 2 mM 1-glutamine , 1 mm pyruvate .
Expression plasmids A 320-bp cDNA fragment encoding the 5'-end of HIF-l1a ( nucleotides 152 to 454 ; GenBank AFOO03698 ) was produced through PCR using the IMAGE clone 851237 as a template , and the two primers ( 5 GGG GAT CCT CTG GAC TTG TCT CTT TC3 and 5 GGG CTC GAG TAA CTG ATG GTG AGC CTC 3 ) .
The fragment was cloned into pGEMT ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) , and then subcloned into peDNA3 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) at BamHI and Xhol sites in sense orientation , and into peDNA3B at Xhol and BamHI sites in an antisense orientation .
The peDNA3B expression vector is identical to peDNA3 , except the polylinker is reversed ( Lehnert et al , unpublished ) .
The expression plasmid B7-1-pCDMS , which contains a 1.2 kb cDNA fragment encoding full-length mouse B7-1 was constructed from a cDNA clone kindly provided by Dr P Linsley , Bristol-Myers-Squibb , Seattle , WA , USA .
Gene transfer of expression plasmids and measurement of antitumor activity Purified plasmids were diluted in a solution of 5 % glucose in 0.01 % Triton X-100 , and mixed in a ratio of 1:3 ( wtwt ) with DOTAP cationic liposomes ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) , which is an efficient transfection vehicle . ``
Final plasmid concentration was 1 mg/ml .
Tumors were established by injection of 2 x 10° EL-4 tumor cells into the right flank of mice , and growth determined by measuring two perpendicular diameters .
Animals were killed when tumors reached more than 1 cm in diameter , in accord with Animal Ethics Approval ( University of Auckland ) .
Tumors reached 0.1 and 0.4 cm in diameter after approximately 14-18 days , and were injected with 100 pl expression plasmid ( 100 ug ) .
For combinational treatment , reagents were delivered in a timed fashion , as described previously . ``
Thus , B7-1 cDNA was injected first , followed by antisense HIF-l « cDNA 48 h later .
Empty vectors served as control reagents .
Cured mice were rechallenged 3 weeks after the disappearance of tumors by injecting 1 x 10° EL-4 cells subcutaneously into the opposing flank ( left flank ) .
All experiments included six mice per group , and each experiment was repeated at least once .
Antisense HIF-1 « enhances cancer immunotherapy X Sun et al Immunohistochemistry Tumor cryosections ( 10 um ) were prepared 2 days following gene transfer , treated with acetone , rinsed with PBS , and blocked with 2 % BSA for 2 h. The sections underwent a overnight incubation with either a hamster anti-B7-1 mAb ( 1610 , Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA ) , mouse anti-mouse HIF-1 « mAb ( H1 « 67 , Novus Biologi-cals , Littleton , CO , USA ) , or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against VEGF ( Ab-1 , Lab Vision , CA , USA ) .
They were subsequently incubated for 30 min with appropriate secondary antibodies , using the VECTASTAIN Universal Quick kit ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA ) ; and developed with Sigma FAST DAB ( 3,3'-diaminoben-zidine tetrahydrochloride ) and COCI , enhancer tablets ( Sigma ) .
Sections were counterstained with Mayer 's hematoxylin , mounted and examined by microscopy .
Assessment of vascularity Sections ( 10 um ) were cut from fresh frozen tumors 4 days following gene transfer .
Slides were immunostained with the anti-CD31 antibody , MEC13.3 ( Pharmingen ) , as above .
The method for assessment of blood vessel density was as described . ``
Briefly , 40x high power magnification fields ( 0.155 mm ) were blindly and randomly chosen for blood vessel counts .
Blood vessels stained with anti-CD31 mAb were recorded for five fields , and the mean of the highest three counts per surface area ( 0.155 mm ) was calculated .
The concentric circles method*~ was used to assess vascularity .
Western blotting Tumors previously injected with anti-sense HIF-1 « , sense HIF-l « , or empty plasmid were excised , and homogenized in lysate buffer ( 50 mmol/l Tris pH 7.4 , 100 mol/l EDTA , 0.25 mol/l sucrose , 1 % SDS , 1 % NP40 , 1 ug/ml leupeptin , 1umg/ml pepstatin A and 100 mol/l phenyImethylsulfonylfluoride ) at 4°C using a motor-driven Virtus homogenizer ( Virtus , Gardiner , NY , USA ) .
Tumor lysates from each group of mice were pooled , and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4°C .
Samples containing 100 ug protein per well were resolved on 10 % polyacrylamide SDS gels under reducing conditions , and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane ( Hybond C extra ; Amersham Life Science Buckinghamshire , UK ) .
Blots were stained with Ponceau S to ensure correct transfer of proteins .
After blocking the membranes with 3 % BSA in TBS-T ( 20 mmol/l Tris , 137 mmol/l NaCl pH 7.6 containing 0.1 % Tween-20 ) for 2 h at room temperature , the blots were incubated with either anti-mouse HIF-l « mAb ( H1 « 67 , Novus Biologicals ) , or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against VEGF ( Ab-1 , Lab Vision ) .
The membranes were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxi-dase-conjugated secondary antibodies , and immuno-reactivity detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) , and exposure to X-ray film .
Depletion of leukocyte subsets Mice were depleted of CD8+* and CD4* T cells , and NK cells by i.p .
and i.v .
injection 4 days before gene transfer , and thereafter every alternate day with 300 ug ( 0.1 ml ) of the 53-6.72 ( anti-CD8 ) , GKk1.5 ( anti-CD4 ) , and PK136 ( anti-NK ) mAbs .
Rat IgG ( Sigma ) was used as a control antibody .
Antibodies were ammonium sulphate fractions of ascites , which titered to at least 1:2000 by FACS 643 Gene Therapy Antisense HIF-L1 « enhances cancer immunotherapy X Sun et al 644 ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA , USA ) staining of spleno-cytes .
Depletion of individual leukocyte subsets was found to be more than 90 % effective , as determined by FACScan analysis .
Statistical analysis Results were expressed as mean values + standard deviation ( s.d . )
, and a Student 's £ test was used for evaluating statistical significance .
A value of P < 0.05 was used for statistical significance .
