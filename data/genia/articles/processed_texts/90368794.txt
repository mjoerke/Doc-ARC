Cell Type Specificity and Activation Requirements for NFAT-1 ( Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells ) Transcriptional Activity Determined by a New Method Using Transgenic Mice to Assay Transcriptional Activity of an Individual Nuclear Factor* { Received for publication , April 12 , 1990 ) Cornelis L. Cynthia Guidos§ , and Gerald R. Crabtree From the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and §Department of Pathology , Beckman Center , Stanford University Medical School , Stanford , California 94305 Nuclear factor of activated T-cells ( NFAT-1 ) is a transcription factor which is considered to be an important regulator in early T-cell activation .
We have developed a system to monitor the transcriptional activity of NFAT-1 at the single cell level in whole animals .
The system is based on the use of an oligomerized NFAT-1 binding motif that directs transcription of SV40 T-antigen in transgenic mice .
This report represents the first demonstration that a multimerized short binding motif can function appropriately in transgenic mice .
NFAT-1 activity had previously been thought to be confined to activated T-lymphocytes upon release of intracellular calcium .
By targeting NFAT-1-dependent gene expression in transgenic mice we discovered new sites of NFAT-1 activity .
Besides in T-lymphocytes NFAT-1 activity could also be induced in T-lymphocyte-depleted spleen cells and purified B-lymphocytes and requires agents that both release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C , .
A difference in the time course of appearance of NFAT-1 activity between T-lymphocytes and non-T-lymphocytes was revealed .
Constitutive expression was observed in a small population of cells in the dermis and some mice have developed skin lesions .
Interestingly , the tissue pattern of expression of the NFAT-1 activity resembles the expression pattern described for HIV-LTR/tat transgenic mice ( Vogel , J. , Hinrichs , S. H. , Reynolds , R. K. , Luciw , P. A. , and Jay , G. ( 1988 ) Nature 335 , 606-611 ) .
This similarity in expression and the fact that NFAT-1 has been shown to bind functional sequences in HIV-LTR suggest a role for NFAT-1 in dermal activation of the HIV-LTR .
The transcriptional activity of a gene is generally believed to be determined by nuclear factors that interact with specific cis-elements in the regulatory regions of the gene ( for reviews see Ptashne , 1988 ; Mitchell and Tjian , 1989 ) .
The regulatory regions or enhancers contain , in most cases , a combination of * These studies were supported by National Institutes of Health Grants HL 33942 and CA 39612 ( to G. R. C. ) and National Institutes of Health Grant CA 42551 ( to Irving Weissman ) .

binding sites for different transcriptional activators .
The observed tissue or cell type specificity might be the outcome of the combinatorial action of different distinct factors or determined by a distinct tissue- or cell type-specific factor like the pituitary-specific factor Pit-1 ( or GHF-1 ) for the cell-specific expression of growth hormone and prolactin ( Nelson et al .
, 1988 ) .
Nuclear factor of activated T-cells ( NFAT-1 ) ' is a transcriptional activator involved in regulation of the gene for interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and is considered to be an important regulator in early T-cell activation ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ) .
Synthesis of IL-2 is restricted to T-cells and is regulated at the transcriptional level ( Fujita et al .
, 1986 ; Siebenlist et al .
, 1986 ) .
The IL-2 gene is controlled by a 267-bp enhancer extending from -52 to -319 containing all the information for T-cell-specific inducible activation of IL-2 transcription ( Fig .
1 ) ( Fujita et al .
, 1986 ; Siebenlist et al .
, 1986 ; Durand et al .
, 1987 ) .
This enhancer contains a combination of different protein binding motifs and several nuclear proteins have been implicated in its regulation .
NFAT-1 binds the sequence between -263 and -290 in the IL-2 enhancer ( Durand et al .
, 1988 ; Shaw et al .
, 1988 ) .
Furthermore , NFAT-1 or a NFAT-1 like factor has been shown to bind functional sequences in the HIV-LTR ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ) .
Expression of the IL-2 gene is not only tissue-specific but also strictly dependent on induction .
Binding of ligands to the T-cell antigen receptor in association with the proper histocompatibility molecules on the surface of antigen-pre-senting cells underlies the physiological triggering for T-cell activation and IL-2 production .
The T-cell antigen receptor interaction can be bypassed by using a calcium ionophore , ionomycin , in conjunction with the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , which provide an increase in intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C , respectively ( Wiskocil et al .
, 1985 ; Weiss et al .
, 1984 ; Truneh et al .
, 1985 ; Imboden and Stobo , 1985 ) .
In vitro studies using a panel of different cell lines have shown that NFAT-1 binding and transcriptional activity can only be detected in human and murine T-cell lines after stimulation via the T-cell receptor or with agents that release intracellular calcium ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ; Crabtree , 1989 ) .
As for IL-2 mRNA transcription the induction of NFAT-1 transcriptional activity is specifically blocked by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A ( Em- 'The abbreviations used are : NFAT-1 , nuclear factor of activated T-cells ; IL-2 , interleukin 2 ; bp , base pair ( s ) ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; ConA , concanavalin A ; Hepes , 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1-piperazineethanesul-fonic acid ; FACS , fluorescence-activated cell sorter ; HIV-LTR , human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat .

These findings suggest that NFAT-1 is a T-cell-specific inducible transcription factor that responds to calcium-mediated signals initiated at the T-cell receptor and accounts for the T-cell specificity of IL-2 expression .
To test this hypothesis we have developed a system to assay for NFAT-1 transcriptional activity in transgenic mice .
Transgenic mice provide a unique model for determining the sequences of a gene which are required for inducible cell type-specific expression of that gene .
Such a model offers the possibility to test the activity of NFAT-1 in every cell in vivo .
Oligomers of a number of binding sites for individual transcription factors have been shown to regulate transcription from a heterologous promoter in transient expression systems in a manner which reflects the transcriptional activity of the factors that bind these sequences ( Angel et al .
, 1987 ; Lee et al .
, 1987 ; Durand et al .
, 1988 ; Pierce et al .
, 1988 ) .
To date this approach has not been applied to transgenic animals .
In this study we have used NFAT binding sites to direct expression of SV40 T-antigen in transgenic mice .
Evidence is presented that the expression of the transgene is indicative for NFAT-1 transcriptional activity .
This approach has allowed an unambiguous analysis of the activation requirements and cell type specificity of NFAT-1 transcriptional activity .
The similarity in the expression pattern between the NFAT-1/SV40 T-antigen mice and the HIV-LTR/tat mice ( Vogel et al .
, 1988 ) suggests a role for NFAT -1 in HIV-LTR activation .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plasmid Construction and Microinjection-A plasmid was made by fusion of the XAhol site at position -294 from the internal deletion mutant ILs6 to the Xhol site at position -72 in the deletion mutant ILs22 ( Durand et al .
, 1988 ) .
This plasmid , lacking 222 bp of the IL-2 enhancer/promoter region ( -319 to +47 ) fused to the CAT gene , was linearized with Xhol and the ends were phosphatased and filled in by Klenow polymerase .
Multiple copies of the double-stranded NFAT -1 oligonucleotide were ligated in this site .
Prior to addition of the blunt-ended vector to the ligation reaction the oligonucleotides were allowed to self-ligate for 3 min at room temperature .
After cloning in Escherichia coli , plasmids containing 0-6 copies of the NFAT-1 binding site were obtained .
Copy number and orientation of the NFAT-1 binding sites were determined by enzyme digestion analysis and/or sequencing ( Sanger et cal .
, 1977 ) .
The NFAT-Tag and ATag transgenes ( see Fig .
1 ) were constructed by replacing a HindIII-BamHI fragment containing the CAT gene in the construct with and without NFAT-1 binding sites , respectively , with the SV40 T-antigen gene , assembled from a 404-bp HindIII-BstXI and a 2234-bp BstXI-BamHI fragment derived from viral SV40 DNA .
Linear DNA fragments containing the transgenes were excised from the vector with ClaI and HindIII , separated on low melting point agarose gels , and isolated by means of Elutip-d column elution ( Schleicher & Schuell ) .
DNA was diluted to a final concentration of 4 ug/ml and injected into pronuclei of fertilized eggs obtained from C57B1/6 females and reimplanted in pseudopregnant C129 females ( Hogan et al .
, 1986 ) .
Genomic DNA isolated from tail segments of the offspring was used to identify transgenic mice by Southern blot and/or dot blot analysis .
Transgene sequences were revealed by hybridization with a nick-translated SV40 T-antigen probe .
Cell Culture and Transfection-The human Jurkat T cell leukemia line , 702/3 and Ly1* B-cell lines were cultured in RPMI ( Gibco ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 units/ml penicillin , and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin .
Transfection of Jurkat cells by DEAE-dextran was done as described previously ( Durand et al .
, 1987 ) .
At 40 h after transfection the cells were stimulated as indicated with ionomycin ( 500 ng/ml ) or anti-T3 ( C305 , 1/10,000 ) ( Weiss and Stobo , 1984 ) in the absence or presence of PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) .
Cells were harvested for assay of CAT expression 8 h after stimulation ( Gorman et al .
, 1982 ) .
Cell Preparation-Spleen and/or thymus were removed aseptically from 6-8-week-old mice immediately after cervical dislocation and prepared as single cell suspensions .
Cells were cultured at 2 x 10° cells/ml in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( Gibco ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol , 100 units/ml penicillin , and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin .
Cells were stimulated as indicated with ionomycin ( 500 ng/ml ) , ConA ( 6 ug/ml ) , or anti-CD3 15789 ( 145-2C11 , 2 ug/ml ) ( Leo et al .
, 1987 ) in the absence or presence of PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) .
In some experiments cyclosporin A ( 100 ng/ml ) was added at this time .
Cells were harvested at different time periods after stimulation and total RNA was isolated .
T-cells were removed from splenocytes by incubating 10° cells/ml with anti-Thy-1.2 ( 42-21 ) in Hanks ' buffered salt solution , 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.0 , and 2 % fetal bovine serum for 30 min on ice .
Cells were subsequently pelleted through 1 ml of fetal bovine serum , resuspended in TC199 medium ( Gibco ) with agarose-preabsorbed complement ( % ) and 100 ug/ml DNase I , and incubated for 45 min at 38 °C .
The percentage of contaminating CD3-positive cells was less than 2 % after one round of elimination as determined by flow cytometry carried out on a highly modified dual laser fluorescence-activated cell sorter FACS IV ( Becton Dickinson , Sunnyvale , CA ) made available through the Stanford shared users group .
About 90 % of the remaining cells were B-cells .
Pure splenic B- and T-cell populations were obtained by incubation with fluorescein-conjugated RA3-6B2 ( anti-6B220 ) and 53-2.1 ( anti-Thy-1.2 ) monoclonal antibodies , respectively .
Positive cells were im-munomagnetically selected and then further purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( Guidos et al .
, 1989 ) .
This two-step procedure yielded B or T populations of greater than 99.5 % purity when re-analyzed by flow cytometry .
Flow cytometric analysis and sorting was performed using a highly modified dual laser FACS IV .
RNA Analyses-Total RNA was isolated from various tissues and cultured cells by the guanidium thiocyanate ( Chirgwin et al .
, 1979 ) and hot phenol extraction ( Verweij et al .
, 1985 ) procedures , respectively .
RNA was quantitated by spectrophotometry at 260 nm .
RNA mapping experiments with the Sp6/T7 RNA polymerase system were done according to Melton et al .
( 1984 ) .
Equal amounts of 10 ug of RNA/analysis were used , unless otherwise noted , which was verified by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis of 5 % of the sample .
For the mapping of correctly initiated NFAT -Tag mRNA a Sp6 RNA probe was transcribed from EcoRI-digested pSP65IL-2 containing a 117-bp Xhol-HindIII fragment from -70 to +47 of NFAT-Tag ( see Fig .
1 ) .
This probe generates a 47-nucleotide RNase-resistant fragment after hybridization to correctly initiated NFAT Tag transcripts .
Hybridization was allowed to proceed at 42 °C for 16 h and samples were digested with 4 ug/ml RNase A and 160 units/ ml RNase T1 at 30 °C for 1 h. For mapping of the murine IL-2 RNAs the riboprobe was synthesized from the T7 promoter of the HindIII-digested pCD-IL-2 plasmid , kindly provided by Dr. Frank Lee ( DNAX , Palo Alto , CA ) containing the 900-bp murine IL-2 Pst [ -Acel cDNA fragment ( Yokota et al .
, 1985 ) .
This probe generates a 400-nucleotide RNase-resistant fragment after hybridization to murine IL-2 mRNA .
Protected fragments were electrophoresed on 5 % denaturing polyacrylamide gels and exposed to XAR-5 film .
Immunofluorescence-Spleen cells were cultured and 10° cells were pelleted on a microscope slide by cytospin centrifugation .
The cells were fixed for 5 min in methanol at -20 °C followed by 30 s in acetone at -20 °C .
The fixed samples were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Tag monoclonal antibody PB1Q01 ( Gurney et al .
, 1980 ) for 30 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with bovine serum albumin ( 2 % ) and then washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline/2 % bovine serum albumin and examined under a fluorescence microscope .
Skin tissue was dipped in Tissue-Tek OCT embedding medium ( Miles ) , frozen in dry CO ; , stored at -70 °C , and sectioned at -20 °C onto microscope slides .
Fixation and staining were done as described above .
Nuclear Extracts-Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Ohlsson and Edlund ( 1986 ) .
Nuclear proteins were finally precipitated with 90 % saturated ( NH , ) ; SO , and dissolved in 50 mM Hepes , pH 7.8 , 50 mM KCI , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 10 % glycerol .
Binding reactions contained 3 ug of nuclear extracts , 25 mM Hepes , pH 7.8 , 75 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0.5 mm dithiothreitol , 0.5 mM phenylmeth-ylsulfonyl ] fluoride , 5 % glycerol , 1.5 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , and about 5000 cpm of a **P NFAT oligonucleotide probe in a volume of 15 ul .
Nuclear extracts from 702/83 and 5B2.1 cells were prepared as described before ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ) and 10 ug was used per binding assay .
The assay for DNA-protein complexes was performed as described previously ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ; Fried and Crothers , 1981 ) .
RESULTS Construction of NFAT-1/SV40 T-antigen Hybrid Gene-Regulatory transcription units were designed consisting of 0-6 copies of the 30-bp NFAT-1 binding sequence linked to the 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san§ 4q /310-2q [ 'mmmy/ : duy wou ; papeojumo ( 15790 IL-2 promoter region ( -70 to +47 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
This portion of the IL-2 promoter is not responsive to T-cell activation signals and has little or no activity in transfection studies ( Fujita et al .
, 1986 ; Durand et al .
, 1987 ; Serfling et al .
, 1989 ; Williams et al .
, 1988 ) .
Initially , these units were cloned upstream of the CAT gene to test their T-cell-specific inducible activation of transcription in Jurkat cells .
Inducibility of CAT activity was observed for the constructs harboring two or more copies of the NFAT-1 sequence upon stimulation via the T-cell receptor , whereas the level of activation of transcription seemed to reach a maximum for the constructs with three to four copies of the NFAT-1 binding sequence ( data not shown ) .
The mode of activation of these constructs are in accord with that required for NFAT-1 binding and transcriptional activity described previously in that it is active in T-cells stimulated through the antigen receptor or with agents that increase intracellular calcium ( calcium is felt to be an essential mediator of signals initiated at the T-cell antigen receptor ) ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ; Durand et al .
, 1988 ) .
To prepare the transgene , designated NFAT we used the plasmid containing three copies of the 30-bp NFAT-1 binding site .
The CAT gene was replaced by the SV40 T-antigen ( Tag ) gene ( Fig .
1 ) .
As a control a similar construct without the NFAT-1 binding sites , designated ATag , was prepared .
The transgenes were excised from the vector , puri-fied , and injected into fertilized C57BI/6J eggs ( Hogan et al .
, 1985 ) .
Four founder transgenic mice with NFAT called Tag8 , Tag9 , Tagl1 , and Tag23 , and five mice with the ATag control gene , called A38 , A52 , A83 , A94 , and A96 , were pro-duced .
Eight of these founder mice were successfully bred to produce stable lines of transgenic mice containing approximately 4 ( line 8 ) , 20 ( line 9 ) , 20 ( line 11 ) , 1 { line 23 ) , 10 ( line A52 ) , > 20 ( line A83 ) , 5 ( line A94 ) , and 1 ( line A95 ) copy per genome .
Only one transgenic founder , A38 , was sterile .

Schematic representation of functional sequences within the IL-2 enhancer and structure of the NFAT-Tag transgene .
The IL-2 flanking region including the enhancer and promoter is represented by a bar ( -319 to +47 ) .
The open boxes within the IL-2 enhancer indicate regions which are protected from digestion by DNase I ( NFIL-2A , -65/-94 ; AP-1 , -177/-184 , NF-kB/AP-3 , -~188/-208 ; NFIL-2A , -234/-259 ; and NFAT-1 , -257/ -286 ) , and have been identified as the binding sites for the indicated factors based on studies using the purified proteins and cross-com-petition studies ( Serfling et al .
, 1989 ; Nabel et al .
, 1988 ; Jung et al .
, 1988 ; Brunvand et al .
, 1988 ; K. S. Ullman , C. A. Edwards , and G. R. Crabtree , unpublished observations ) .
The arrow indicates the initiation site of transcription .
The NFAT -Tag transgene contains successively the sequence -319 to -283 of the IL-2 enhancer , three copies of the NFAT -1 binding site , the IL-2 promoter sequence from ~70 to +47 , and the SV40 T-antigen gene .
Transcribed RNA is indicated underneath the corresponding gene sequences .
The 176-nucleotide ( n ) Sp6 antisense RNA probe used in RNase protection experiments contains the IL-2 enhancer sequence from -70 to +47 and 60 nucleotides of pSP polylinker sequences ( open bar ) .
Correctly initiated mRNA would yield a 47-nucleotide protected fragment .
NFAT-1 Transcriptional Activity in Transgenic Mice correctly initiated SV40 T-antigen mRNA by RNase protection .
As illustrated in Fig .
1 the 176-nucleotide RNA probe used in these experiments is complementary to 47 nucleotides of the expected 5 end of the NFAT mRNA .
Therefore , hybridization of the probe to correctly initiated transcripts should yield a 47-bp hybrid after RNase digestion .
Results presented in Fig .
2 are from studies with a mouse from line Tag8 .
Correctly initiated transcripts were detected in thymus , spleen , and bone marrow cells stimulated with ionomycin and PMA .
Unexpectedly , we also detected transcripts in skin without induction .
The remaining tissues including bladder , fat , unstimulated spleen , unstimulated thymus , brain , intes-tine , testis , liver , kidney , lung , muscle , heart , parotid , stom-ach , pancreas , and unstimulated bone marrow cells did not express detectable levels of NFAT mRNA .
We observed a difference in the level of expression between the different lines .
Two lines , Tagl1 and Tag23 , revealed a very low level of transcripts in stimulated spleen and thymus cells , whereas one line , Tag8 , was a strong expressor and one line , Tag9 , was intermediate in expression .
The tissue specificity of NFAT-Tag mRNA expression for all four NFAT-Tag lines was identical ( data not shown ) .
Further studies were done with mice belonging to lines Tag8 and Tag9 .
As a control for the specific effects of the NFAT-1 binding sites we analyzed expression of the transgene in mice representing lines A52 , A83 , A94 , and A95 harboring the construct without NFAT-1 binding sites .
No transcripts could be detected in stimulated spleen , thymus and bone marrow cells , skin , and other tissues from mice of lines A94 and A95 .
Mice from the other two lines revealed `` read through `` transcription in all tissues tested but no properly initiated transcripts ( data not shown ) .
Integration of the transgene in these two lines of transgenic mice has most likely occurred at a locus under the transcriptional control of an ubiquitously active promoter .
From this data we conclude that the observed tissue-specific expression of NFAT -Tag can be ascribed to the presence of the NFAT-1 binding sites .
Kinetics of NFAT-Tag mRNA Expression-RNase protection analysis was used to study the time course of induction of NFAT mRNA and IL-2 mRNA after activation of spleen cells with ionomycin and PMA ( Fig .
3 ) .
No mRNA was detected from either of the two genes prior to stimulation .
Detectable levels of mRNA for both genes were present after 1 h. Comparison of the later kinetics of induction of the IL-2 gene with the transgene in both thymus ( data not shown ) and spleen cells revealed that the patterns diverged .
NFAT-Tag mRNA accumulates until 36 h while IL-2 mRNA accumulates to maximum levels at 6 h post-stimulation .
Cell Type Specificity of NFAT-Tag mRNA Expression-Based on in vitro studies using gel-shift and footprint analyses and transient expression studies we anticipated that activated T-cells in the spleen of NFAT-Tag mice are responsible for the NFAT transcription ( Shaw et el .
, 1988 ) .
To test the T-cell specificity of NFAT mRNA expression we selectively depleted T-cells from splenocytes prior to stimulation by complement lysis using an anti-Thy-1.2 monoclonal anti-body .
The resulting population contained about 90 % B-cells and less than 2 % T-cells .
Analysis of IL-2 mRNA indicated that only a small amount of IL-2 mRNA was present in the remaining cells after activation with ionomycin and PMA , indicating depletion of most of the T-cells ( Fig .
4C ) .
In the T-cell-depleted spleen no NFAT-Tag mRNA could be detected 1 and 2 h after stimulation with ionomycin and PMA ; however , after 24 h synthesis of approximately similar amounts of NFAT -Tag transcripts in total spleen and T-cell-depleted spleen were detected ( Fig .
44 ) .

Spleen , thymus , and bone marrow cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of ionomycin ( 0.6 aM ) and PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) .
Ten ug of each RNA sample was used in an RNase protection assay .
As probe we used the 176-nucleotide P-labeled antisense NFAT-Tag RNA probe .

Time course of NFAT-Tag and IL-2 gene expression after stimulation with ionomycin and PMA .
Spleen cells ( 5-10 X 10° ) were stimulated with ionomycin and PMA and harvested at the indicated time points after stimulation .
Total RNA was extracted by the hot phenol method ( Verweij et al .
, 1985 ) and 10 ug was used for detection of NFAT -Tag mRNA ( A ) and IL-2 mRNA ( B ) by RNase protection analysis .
As probes we used the 176-nucleotide `` *P -labeled antisense NFAT -Tag RNA fragment and a 420-nucleotide *P -labeled antisense IL-2 RNA fragment , yielding protected fragments from hybridization with correctly initiated transcripts with a length of 47 nucleotides ( Tag ) and 400 nucleotides ( IL-2 ) , respectively .
The position of these fragments in the gel are indicated by an arrow .
at the 1- and 2-h time points the NFAT mRNA originates from T-cells while after 24 h the majority of NFAT-Tag mRNA synthesized in total spleen cell cultures originates from non-T-cells .
To further explore the cell type specificity of NFAT-Tag transcription we purified B- and T-cells from a splenocyte suspension .
First we enriched for either B- or T-cells using lineage-specific antibodies plus magnetic beads followed by cell sorting on the FACS .
Populations of B- and T-cells , each approximately of 99.5 % purity , were obtained and tested for NFAT -Tag transcriptional activity .
As is shown in Fig .
44 in both cell populations transcription was induced after 24 h of stimulation with ionomycin and PMA .
Activation Requirements for NFAT-Tag mRNA Expres-sion-Ionomycin and PMA provide two signals , i.e .
an increase in intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C , respectively , required for IL-2 gene expression and T-cell activation .
These stimuli bypass interaction of the T-cell receptor with the combination of an antigen and the proper histocompatibility molecules on the surface of antigen-pre-senting cells ( Wiskocil et al .
, 1985 ; Weiss et al .
, 1984 ; Truneh et al .
, 1985 ; Imboden and Stobo , 1985 ) .
We determined whether the NFAT -Tag transgene responded to physiological stimuli by replacing ionomycin with either of two polyclonal stimuli that could mimic physiological triggering by binding with the antigen receptor , ie .
ConA and anti-CD3 .
RNase protection was used to quantitate NFAT-Tag and IL-2 transcripts in splenocytes from transgenic mice stimulated with these different stimuli ( Fig .
4 , B and C ) .
Stimulation with ionomycin alone induced considerably less NFAT mRNA compared with ionomycin- and PMA-stimulated cells , while PMA by itself did not induce NFAT-Tag transcription within our detection limits which are less than one transcript/cell .
This indicates that PMA facilitates the induction of NFAT Tag mRNA but is insufficient alone .

C , responsiveness of splenocytes and T-cell-depleted cells to the indicated stimuli was determined by assaying for IL-2 mRNA production after stimulation for 6 h ( lanes 1-3 ) and 24 h ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
The arrow shows the position of the protected fragment ( IL-2 ) .
of splenocytes with ConA or anti-CD3 in the presence of PMA for 6 h resulted in the induction of NFAT-Tag mRNA tran-scription , although the levels were low compared to the signal from ionomycin- and PMA-stimulated cells .
However , ConA and anti-CD3 also stimulated lower levels of IL-2 mRNA than ionomycin and PMA .
These results indicate that the activation signals necessary for the expression of the endogenous IL-2 gene are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those required for activation of the NFAT -Tag transgene .
Expression of SV40 T-antigen Gene Product-RNase protection studies have shown that NFAT-Tag mRNA is expressed in lymphocytes after induction with ionomycin and PMA and in skin without induction .
To ascertain that this NFAT-1 Transcriptional Activity in Transgenic Mice expression correlates with the presence of SV40 T-antigen protein we stained histological preparations of tissue from NFAT-Tag mice for T-antigen .
As antibody we used the monoclonal antibody PB101 , directed against the COOH-terminal part of T-antigen ( Gurney et al .
, 1980 ) .
Expression of T-antigen could be detected by direct staining of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies in nuclei of stimulated spleen and thymus cells ( Fig .
54 ) .
About 15 % of the cells stained positively for T-antigen .
Immunocy-tochemical analysis of skin sections showed a small number of T-antigen-positive cells in the dermis ( Fig .
5B ) .
Correlation of NFAT-Tag Transcription with NFAT-1 Binding Activity-To determine whether NFAT-Tag transcription correlates with NFAT-1 binding activity we prepared nuclear extracts from cells stimulated under conditions known to regulate NFAT-1 ( Fig .
64 ) .
No NFAT-1 binding activity assayed by gel retardation was detected in liver cells and brain cells .
A faint band was observed using extracts of unstimulated spleen .
Significantly more binding activity was present in extracts from spleen and T-cell depleted spleen after stimulation .
A 100-fold excess of unlabeled NFAT-1 oligonucleotide competed for the formation of NFAT-1 com-plex .
No inhibition of complex formation was observed when a similar excess of the HNF-1 binding sequence beta-28 ( Courtois et al .
, 1987 ) was used as competitor , indicating that binding was sequence specific .
Splenic B-cells consist of a heterogenous population of cells .
We have done some preliminary studies on NFAT-1 binding activity in the murine B-cell leukemia 70 % /3 ( Paige et al .
, 1978 ) and the murine ly1* B-cell line 5B2.1 ( Lainer et al .
, 1981 ) .
In one of these cell lines , 5B2.1 , we could detect inducible NFAT-1 binding activity in nuclear extracts of cells stimulated with ionomycin and PMA ( Fig .
6B ) .

Binding of inducible nuclear proteins to the NFAT 1 motif .
A , nuclear extracts were prepared from tissues from a C57B16 mouse .
Equivalent amounts ( 3 ug ) of nuclear extracts from brain ( lane 2 ) , liver ( lane 3 ) , PMA + ionomycin-stimulated ( 24 h ) spleen ( lanes 4 and 12 ) , PMA + ionomycin-stimulated ( 24 h ) T-cell-depleted spleen ( lanes 5 and 15 ) , unstimulated spleen ( lane 6 ) , ionomycin + PMA-stimulated ( 4 h ) Jurkat cells ( lanes 7 and 18 ) , and dermal tumor cells ( lane 8 ) were incubated with a double-stranded **P-labeled NFAT-1 binding site , and free DNA ( fp ) and protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4 % native polyacrylamide gel .
Nuclear extracts from dermal tumor cells ( lanes 9 and 10 ) , stimulated spleen ( lanes 13 and 14 ) and T-cell-depleted spleen ( lanes 16 and 17 ) were incubated with `` *P -labeled NFAT -1 binding site in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled NFAT-1 binding site ( lanes 9 , 13 , and 16 ) or 8-28 ( hepatocyte nuclear factor binding site ) ( lanes 10 , 14 , and 17 ) .
Mobility of the P-labeled oligonucleotide incubated without extract is also shown ( lanes I and 11 ) .
B , nuclear extracts prepared from the Ly1* B-cell line 5B2.1 before ( NS , lane 2 ) and after stimulation with ionomycin and PMA ( S , lane 3 ) were incubated with P-labeled NFAT binding site .
A 1- , 10- , and 100-fold excess of unlabeled NFAT-1 ( lanes 4-6 ) and mutant NFAT-1 ( mut ) ( lanes 7-9 ) oligonucleotides were added to the extracts of stimulated cells as competitor .
The mutant oligonucleotide contains four G to T substitutions in the contact G residues and has the sequence 5'-AAGAAAGGAGaAAAAAaTtTTTaATACAG-3 ' .
The nucleotides in small letters are the mutated guanosines where methylation interferes with NFAT-1 binding ( J. P. Shaw and G. R. Crabtree , unpublished results ) .
tumors .
Cells from these tumors were positive for NFAT -Tag mRNA ( data not shown ) .
We consider the dermal tumor cells representative for the dermal cells expressing the transgene constitutively .
To determine whether also in these cells the appearance of NFAT -Tag mRNA correlates with the presence of NFAT-1 binding activity we assayed tumor cells from a Tag9 mouse for NFAT-1 binding activity .
Nuclear extracts prepared from cells of this tumor also contained NFAT binding activity ( Fig .
64 ) .
Characterization of the tumor cells 15793 will be carried out and be published elsewhere .
These results indicate that the observed transcriptional activity of NFAT-Tag appears to correlate with the appearance of NFAT-1 or an NFAT-1 like binding activity .
Cyclosporin A Inhibits NFAT-Tag Transcription-Cyclo-sporin A is known to inhibit the early events in T-lymphocyte activation ( Kronke et al .
, 1984 ; Elliott et al .
, 1984 ) .
We have recently found that cyclosporin A specifically inhibits the appearance of NFAT binding activity ( Emmel et al .
, 1989 ) .
In addition cyclosporin A abolishes the ability of the NFAT-1 binding site to activate a heterologous promoter in stimulated Jurkat cells .
Cyclosporin A at 100 ng/ml totally blocked the ability of ionomycin and PMA for 2 , 6 , and 24 h to activate NFAT transcription in splenocytes ( Fig .
7 ) .
This result demonstrates the physiological significance of the inhibitory effect of cyclosporin A on NFAT-1 activity and further substantiates our conclusion that NFAT-Tag transcription is dependent on NFAT -1 activity .
DISCUSSION We used three copies of the 30-bp NFAT-1 binding motif to direct expression of T-antigen in transgenic mice .
We have provided evidence that in this setting the expression of the transgene is indicative for NFAT-1 transcriptional activity .
First , the regulatory unit used was shown to respond to signals originating at the T-cell receptor , a result which is in accord with the previously described characteristics for NFAT-1 activation ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ) .
Second , synthesis of properly initiated NFAT mRNA is dependent on the presence of NFAT-1 binding sites .
Third , the tissue-specific transcriptional activity of the transgene was shown to correlate with NFAT-1 binding activity .
Finally , the transcriptional activity of the transgene could be blocked by cyclosporin A ( in vitro studies have previously shown that NFAT-1 binding activity and transcriptional activity could specifically be blocked with cyclosporin A ( Emmel et al .
, 1989 ) ) .
This result represents the first demonstration that oligomerized binding sites for an individual nuclear factor can give appropriate transcriptional regulation in transgenic mice .
Hence , this system allows detection of NFAT -1 activity in individual cells in a physiological background and circumvents the use of cell lines which might have lost normal regulatory control and thus are not representative of normal cell physiology .
The similarity in NFAT-Tag mRNA expression patterns among the four NFAT lines excludes any significant effect on the tissue specificity of expression of the transgene due to the site of integration in the genome of these mice .
However , the variability in the level of expression between the different lines 24 _ time ( hrs ) - + CsA tRNA is a `` ul 1 23 4 5 6 7 Fig .

Inhibition of NFAT-Tag transcription by cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .
Splenocytes from a Tag8 mouse were stimulated with ionomycin and PMA for 2 , 6 , and 24 h in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A ( 100 ng/ml ) .
Total RNA was prepared and 10 ug of each sample was assayed for correctly initiated NFAT -Tag transcripts by RNase protection .
Lane 1 , tRNA ; lane 2 , stimulated for 2 h + cyclosporin A ; lane 3 , 2 h - cyclosporin A ; lane 4 , 6 h - cyclosporin A ; lane 5 , 6 h + cyclosporin A ; lane 7 , 24 h - cyclosporin A ; and lane 8 , 24 h + cyclosporin A .
The position of the protected fragment ( Tag ) indicative for the presence of properly initiated transcripts is indicated by an arrow .
6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san§ 4q /310-2q [ 'mmmy/ : duy wou ; 15794 could be attributed to influences from surrounding sequences .
Costimulation of ionomycin with PMA leads to a dramatic increase in NFAT transcription compared to stimulation with ionomycin alone .
These results contrast with transient expression studies in Jurkat cells in which addition of PMA did not contribute much to NFAT-1 directed transcription ( Durand et al .
, 1988 ) .
Since in the transgenic system the setting of the transgene is in a physiological background we favor the model that NFAT-1 requires both release of intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C to exhibit full transcriptional activity .
In our studies the NFAT -T ag transgene was expressed more broadly than the endogenous IL-2 gene indicating that other elements than the NFAT-1 binding motif are required for the cell type-specific expression of IL-2 .
T-cells as well as B-cells can be activated to exhibit NFAT activity .
A small subpop-ulation of cells in the skin show this activity without stimulation .
Thus , the NFAT-1 activation pathway is not restricted to one cell type .
Since both calcium and protein kinase C mediate NFAT-1 activation these results suggest that NFAT 1 is a general effector at the end of signal transduction pathways originating at different cell surface receptors that use calcium and protein kinase C as intermediates .
For T-lymphocytes NFAT-1 activity is induced in response to signals initiated at the T cell receptor .
We have not been able to identify yet the physiological stimulus for the splenic B-cells .
Stimulation of splenocytes with lipopolysaccharide did not induce NFAT -Tag mRNA ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , we observed a difference in kinetics of appearance of NFAT -Tag mRNA in total spleen cells versus T-cell depleted spleen .
Early expression of NFAT mRNA , i.e .
2 h after induction , seems to originate exclusively from T-cells while after 24 h the majority of NFAT mRNA comes from non-T-cells .
This observation makes it tempting to speculate that temporal differences in the induction of NFAT-1 activity determine T-cell-specific expression of the IL-2 gene .
Previous results indicate that the AP1 , NFIL-2A , NF-kB , and NFAT-1 sites must be present for full activity of the IL-2 enhancer ( Durand et al .
, 1988 ; Serfling et al .
, 1989 ; Hoyos et al .
, 1989 ) .
Simultaneous occupancy of all these sites is probably essential for the cell type-specific initiation of transcription of the IL-2 gene .
In Jurkat cells IL-2 mRNA was first detectable 45 min after stimulation ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ) .
The cellular proto-oncogene product c-fos is induced within 15 min and has been shown to interact with c-jun , and this complex , AP-1 , binds with high affinity to the TPA response element , leading to AP-1-dependent transcription ( Reed et al .
, 1986 ; Rauscher et al .
, 1988 ; Franza et al .
, 1988 ) .
In addition , NF-kB and NFIL-2A transcriptional activity was shown to be induced within 30 min ( Nabel and Baltimore , 1987 ; Chiu et al .
, 1988 ; Sen and Baltimore , 1986 ; Ullman et al .
, 1990 ) .
According to this model , early activated NFAT-1 is a prerequisite for IL-2 gene activation and the temporal regulation of NFAT-1 activity might account for the observed T-cell specificity of IL-2 gene expression .
We have shown that the NFAT -Tag transgene is expressed in the skin .
The expressing cells are localized in the dermis .
Some mice have developed dermal tumors which express the transgene .
By gel retardation analysis we have demonstrated that tumor cells contain NFAT-1 binding activity , indicative that transcription in these cells is directed by NFAT-1 , An analogy of the pattern of expression of NFAT -Tag with that of the HIV-LTR/tat transgene ( Vogel et al .
, 1988 ) can be drawn .
Apart from the dermis constitutive expression of both NFAT -Tag and HIV-LTR/tat was absent in any tissue tested .
HIV-LTR contains sequence motifs within functional regions NFAT-1 Transcriptional Activity in Transgenic Mice which have the potential to bind nuclear proteins .
Besides two binding sites for NF-kB two motifs which bind NFAT-1 or NFAT-1-like protein are described ( Shaw et al .
, 1988 ) .
NFAT-1 is generally believed to contribute to HIV-LTR activation in response to physiological T-cell activation signals and might account for the partial inhibition of HIV-LTR activity by cyclosporin A ( Tong-Starksen et al .
, 1989 ) .
However , the NFAT-1 binding sites are not likely to be essential for HIV-LTR activation since deletion of these sites still allows HIV-LTR to be transcriptionally activated ( Tong-Starksen et al .
, 1989 ) .
Furthermore , calcium-mediated signals were not required for HIV-LTR activation . ``
On the other hand a dimerized NFAT -1 motif was shown to drive transcription from a minimal ( heterologous ) promoter ( Durand et al .
, 1988 ; this paper ) .
Consequently , we propose that NFAT -1 has a role in HIV-LTR activation and accounts for differential expression of HIV-LTR and that the cells in the dermis that express HIV-LTR/tat coincide with the ones that exhibit NFAT-1 activity .
We are initiating studies to determine the phenotype of the NFAT-Tag expressing dermal cells .
Comparison of these cells with the ones that express HIV-LTR/ tat should provide definite evidence to support this model .
We have developed an approach to monitor the activity of a single type of transcriptional activator in a physiological background .
This opens the way to explore the activity of NFAT-1 and its developmental regulation at the individual cell level .
Furthermore , this approach might be of general use to study other transcriptional activators , in particular those which require activation to exhibit transcriptional activity .
