It is shown here that during monocyte to macrophage differentiation , the expression of LAL-mRNA is induced .
This induction is dependent on protein kinase C activity and protein synthesis .
The cell type-specific increase in LAL expression is further investigated in the THP cell line with respect to transcriptional regulation .
The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 differentiates into macrophage-like cells when treated with phorbol esters .
In order to determine the cis-acting elements necessary for both basal and phorbol 12-myristate-13 acetate ( PMA ) -enhanced promoter activity , we performed deletion analysis and reporter gene assays .
A PMA responsive element has been identified between -182 bp and -107 bp upstream of the major transcription start site .
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of Sp1 and AP-2 to the LAL promoter is increased by PMA in THP cells .
Co-transfections with expression plasmids for Sp1 and AP-2 further emphasized the important role of these transcription factors in both basal and PMA-enhanced LAL expression.8§ Our data suggest that differentiation dependent increase of lysosomal acid lipase ( LAL ) expression in THP cells is mediated by a concerted action of Sp1 and AP-2.-Ries , S. , C.

3.1.1.13 ) catalyzes the hydrolysis of both cholesteryl esters and triglycerides that are delivered to lysosomes by low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptormediated endocytosis ( 1 ) .
Free cholesterol is released from lysosomes , which leads to activation of acyl-CoA : cholesterol acyltransferase ( ACAT ) and to down-regulation of LDL receptor gene expression and HMG-CoA reductase activity .
Therefore , LAL contributes to the homeostatic control of plasma lipoprotein levels and to the prevention of cellular lipid overload in liver , spleen , macrophages , and smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall ( 2 ) .
LAL activity is significantly reduced in mononuclear cells from patients suffering from premature coronary heart disease and familial hypercholesterolemia ( 3 , 4 ) .
The role of LAL in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is also emphasized by the existence of an autosomal recessive disease , namely cholesteryl ester storage disease ( CESD ) ( 5 ) .
In this disorder LAL activity is reduced due to mutations within the coding region of the LAL gene .
In contrast , patients with a complete lack of LAL activity { ( Wolman disease ) die within the first year of life ( 6-8 ) .
The LAL gene is approximately 36 kb long , consists of 10 exons , and is transcribed as a 2.4 kb long mRNA ( 9-11 ) .
Mature macrophages extend their lysosomal compartment required for intracellular degradation processes , and therefore enhanced expression of lysosomal enzymes is expected ( 12 ) .
To investigate LAL expression in differentiating monocytes/ macrophages , we have analyzed both peripheral blood monocytes and the human promono-cytic leukemia cell line THP-1 ( 13 ) .
The human leukemia cell line THP-1 may be induced toward a macrophage like state by culture with phorbol esters ; this is characterized by adherence , increased phagocytic activity , and the induction of lysozyme and non-specific esterase activities ( 14 ) .
THP-1 cells thus provide a useful in vitro model to investigate biological properties of macrophages .
Recently , many studies have focused on the alteration of gene expression Abbreviations : LAL , lysosomal acid lipase ; M-CSF , macrophage-colony stimulating factor ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate-l3-acetate ; GAPDH , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ; SR-A , scavenger receptor type A ; EGR , early growth response ; PKC , protein kinase C ; TSS , transcriptional start site ; TBP , TATA-box binding protein .

For example , expression of scavenger receptor type A , vacuolar H*+-AT Pase , and several lysosomal enzymes like cathepsin L are induced during differentiation ( 15-17 ) .
We have examined LAL expression during monocyte to macrophage differentiation and provide evidence for both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation .
As the putative promoter region of the LAL gene has been cloned ( 10 , 11 ) , the 5 ' flanking region was amplified by PCR and promoter elements responsible for transcriptional control were characterized .
A genomic fragment 182 bp upstream of the major transcription start site possesses full promoter activity , that is inducible up to 3.5-fold in THP-1 cells cultured in the presence of PMA .
Binding of transcription factors to specific promoter elements has been demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays .
Our data clearly indicate that transcriptional induction of LAL during monocyte to macrophage differentiation is mediated by a concerted action of transcription factors Spl and AP2 .

The PCR conditions were described previously ( 7 ) .
The PCR products were purified by Qiaex ( Qiagen , Hilden ) , digested with Bgill and KpnI ( pLAL1 , 2 , and 7 ) or BgilI and Nhe ( pLAL3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) and cloned into the pGL3-basic luciferase vector All LAL/ luciferase fusion constructs had a common 3 ' terminus of the LAL gene located at nucleotide +67 , with the fused promoter fragment varying in length from 149 bp to 419 bp .
The LAL gene promoter/ luciferase constructs were sequenced prior to use .
Transient transfection of THP-1 cells and luciferase assays For each experiment 5 X 10 `` THP-1 cells were transfected with 10 pug reporter plasmid DNA by the DEAE-dextran method as previously described ( 24 ) .
Two jug of pSVB-galactosidase plasmid ( Promega , Madison , WI ) was included in all assays and luciferase activities were normalized to -galactosidase activities .
In co-transfection experiments , 100 ng of a transcription factor expression vector or pUC18 plasmid ( negative control ) was added .
To increase transfection efficiency , cells were incubated with 100 wm chloroquine .
After removal of chloroquine , cells were resus-pended in 30 ml complete RPMI 1640 medium , divided into two 75-cm > culture flasks , and incubated for 24 h. PMA ( 160 nm ) was added to one flask 24 h after transfection .
Forty-eight h after transfection cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured in a Lumat LB9501 ( Berthold , Munich ) according to the instructions of the manufacturer ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
B-Gal activity was evaluated in a standard color reaction to detect differences in transfection efficiency ( 25 ) .
Gel mobility shift assays An equivalent of 30,000 cpm of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the desired promoter sequence was incubated with 10 pug of nuclear extract in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES/ HCJ , pH 7.9 , 6 mm MgCl , , 50 mm KCl , 5 mm di A monocytes - B THP-1+ PMA @ » * 0 3 6 9 12 24 48 hours thiothreitol , 100 ug/ ml BSA , 0.01 % NP4O0 , and 2 jg poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia , Freiburg ) at room temperature for 20 min .
Supershift analyses were carried out using antibodies against Spl and AP-2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
For Spl , a rabbit polyclonal antibody against residues 436-454 was used ( catalog number sc-59x ) and AP-2 binding was examined using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against residues 420-437 ( catalog number sc-184x ) .
In competition experiments nuclear extracts were preincubated with a 50-fold molar excess of competitor for 10 min prior to addition of the radiolabeled probe .
DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 8 % poly-acrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography RESULTS Characterization of LAL expression in monocytic cells To study the mechanisms regulating differentiation dependent lysosomal acid lipase ( LAL ) expression in mono-cytes , we performed Northern blot analyses on total cellular RNA isolated from peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages .
Figure 1 A shows a Northern blot hybridized with a 1.2 kb long cDNA fragment generated with the LAL primers LAC1 and LAC2 .
Steady state levels of LAL mRNA increase during differentiation .
Quantification of LAL mRNA was achieved with a ribonuclease protection assay using an RNA probe containing an LAL-specific sequence located +720 to +963 downstream of the major transcription start site .
We allowed the probe to hybridize to 10 pug of total cellular RNA from monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages cultivated in the presence of 50 ng/ ml human recombinant M-CSF for 7 days , or to a negative control ( yeast t-RNA ) .
Isolation and measurement of the protected RNA fragments after gel electrophoresis revealed a strong increase in LAL mRNA induction up to 12.4-fold after 7 days cultivation { numbers in boxes below Fig .

To determine whether this regulation also occurs in the leukemia cell line THP we analyzed the LAL mRNA expression pattern in THP-1 cells differentiated with PMA by Northern blots .
As can be seen in Fig .

Nascent transcripts from untreated and PMA-treated ( 24 h ) THP-1 cells were labeled with « [ *P ] UTP and hybridized to an LAL-specific plastic petri dishes for various times in the presence of 50 ng/ ml M-CSF and from THP-1 cells incubated with 160 nm PMA .

In comparison , the rate of transcription from the GAPDH gene remained relatively constant after PMA incubation .
Because a basal LAL mRNA expression is detectable in THP-1 cells , the observed 4.9-fold increase after PMA stimulation might also be due to altered mRNA stability .
For a number of other genes , PMA has been shown to enhance gene expression by induction of transcriptional activity as well as enhancement of the stability of the corresponding mature mRNA ( 26 , 27 ) .
To evaluate potential posttranscriptional control of LAL mRNA expression , actinomycin D ( 8 mg/ml ) was added to undifferentiated or PMA-exposed THP-1 cells .
RNA extracted at different times from undifferentiated and differentiated THP-1 cells after actinomycin D treatment were subjected to RNase protection analysis .
As can be seen in Fig .
2B , LAL mRNA from undifferentiated THP-1 cells was eliminated more rapidly when transcription was inhibited by actinomycin D ( 40 % of control after 4 h ) .
In PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells , the relative amount of LAL mRNA was unaffected up to 8 h. These data suggest that the LAL mRNA is degraded faster in resting THP-1 cells than in THP-1 cells cultured in the presence of PMA .
Immunoblots from peripheral blood monocytes and THP -1 cells clearly demonstrate that more LAL protein is synthesized as a result of higher LAL mRNA levels ( Fig .
2C ) .
These data indicate that PMAenhanced LAL expression occurs both on transcriptional and post-tran scriptional levels in THP-1 cells .
PMA-induced LAL mRNA up-regulation depends on protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation and new protein synthesis Inhibitors of the PKC path way were used in conjunction with PMA to characterize the signal transduction path ways in volved in the regulation of LAL gene expression .
As can be seen in Fig .
3A , the PKC inhibitors , staurosporine and H7 , caused a remarkable decrease of LAL mRNA in PMA-stimulated THP cells , while the GAPDH mRNA was not affected ( data not shown ) .
Incubation of THP-1 cells with PMA and cycloheximide completely abolished up-regulation of LAL mRNA , while cycloheximide alone did not induce LAL mRNA ( Fig .
3B ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that the transcriptional induction of the LAL gene during PMA-induced monocytic differentiation is dependent upon activation of protein kinase C and requires new protein synthesis .
Mapping of LAL transcriptional start sites 5 ' RACE-PCR analysis indicated two different transcription start points for the LAL gene ( data not shown ) .
In addition , the DNA sequence of the putative promoter region is ( G + C ) -rich and is deficient of a TATA-box .
The exact position of the multiple LAL mRNA start sites was determined using two antisense RNA probes ( PA1l , PAZ ) derived from a genomic clone .

Lanes 1 and 2 contain the undigested probes , yeasttRNA was used as negative control ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Ten jg of total RNA from untreated THP-1 cells ( lane 7 ) or 24-4 incubated THP-1 cells ( lane 5 ) were hybridized to probe PAl .
Lanes 6 and 8 contain the same as lanes 5 and 7 hybridized to probe PAZ .
The protected fragments of 59 bp , 62 bp , 85 bp , and 95 bp are indicated by arrows .

Two strong signals ( TSS A , 59 bp ; TSS B , 62 bp ) and two weak signals ( TSS C and TSS D ) have been generated with either probe ( Fig .
4 ) indicating major and minor transcription start points .
Such a preference is typical for TATAJless and ( G + C ) -rich promoters ( 28 ) .
As all protected fragments generated with the shorter PAZ probe are also generated with the longer PAl probe , further upstream initiation sites can be excluded .
Transcriptional activity from the two major initiation sites is markedly up-regulated in THP-1 cells after incubation in PMA .
5'-Deletion analysis of the LAL promoter To identify sequences important for promoter activity , seven LAL promoter plasmids were constructed by fusing DNA fragments , containing sequential 5 truncations of the putative LAL promoter to the firefly luciferase re Ries e al .

THP-1 cells were transfected with pLALG 10 ug of the various LAL-luciferase constructs and 2 jg pSVB-gal LAL7 plasmid for 24 h. Luciferase and B-galactosidase activity was mea-p porter gene .
The deletions , as shown in Fig .
5A , range from -352 bp to -82 bp in regard to the major transcriptional start site A. Transcriptional activity of the LAL promoter was quantified by measuring luciferase activity expressed by transiently transfected THP-1 cells ( Fig .
5A , B ) .
While the three promoter truncations pLALl , pLAL2 , and pLAL3 result in similar activities , the larger truncation in pLAL4 and pLALS revealed only 60 % activity and promoter activity is nearly abolished in the shortest promoter constructs pLAL6 and pLAL7 .
In the THP-1 cell line , all but the latter two constructs retained PMA-induced promoter activity ( 2.2 to 3.6-fold , Fig .
5B ) .
These values correlate well with the increase in transcription rates found in the nuclear run-on analyses ( Fig .

Co-transfection with Sp1 and AP-2 expression vectors The DNA region exhibiting PMA-inducible promoter activity has been localized between nucleotides -107 and -182 .
Several putative cis-acting consensus sequences are present within this LAL promoter region .
One AP-2 site is located at position -179 to -171 and AP-2 sites are known to be phorbol ester-inducible .
Furthermore , there are two consensus binding sites for the 2130 Journal of Lipid Research Volume 39 , 1998 sured in cellular extracts .
The normalized luciferase activity of each construct in the absence of PMA was taken as 100 % , and the PMA stimulation factor was determined .
The data represent the average of 5 independent experiments of triplicate measurements .
transcription factor Spl at positions -146 to -140 and -120 to -114 .
In order to elucidate the role of these putative binding sites , we co-transfected THP-1 cells with the LAL promoter construct pLAL3 and expression vectors for Spl ( pPacSp1l ) or AP2a ( pCMXAP2a ) , respectively .
As shown in Fig .
6 , expression of Spl or AP-2 caused a significant increase in LAL promoter activity ( 2.7-fold , and 1.8 -fold , respectively ) , demonstrating the involvement of both transcription factors in PMA-induced up-regulation of LAL mRNA in THP-1 cells .
Simultaneous transfection of THP-1 cells with Spl and AP-2 resulted in a 3.5-fold increase of luciferase activity .
These results suggest that both transcription factors act in concert to modulate LAL promoter activity .
Transcription factor binding to the PMA-inducible LAL promoter region To verify whether Spl and AP-2 are indeed components of the binding complex responsible for the inducibility by PMA , we performed gel shift analyses with crude nuclear extracts prepared from resting or PMA-treated THP-1 cells .

Co-transfection with transcription factor expression plas-mids .
THP-1 cells were cotransfected with 10 pg of pLAL3 promoter construct and 100 ng of transcription factor expression vectors for Spl ( pPacSp1 ) , AP2a ( pCMXAP2 @ ) , or a combination of Sp1 and AP-2 .
Cell lysates were used for measurement of luciferase activity .
The data represent the average of 3 independent experiments with triplicate measurements .

GSAl bound to one protein complex in THP-1 cell extracts ( Fig .
7A ) .
Using nuclear extracts from PMA-induced THP-1 cells , a marked increase of this complex I was observed .
Additionally , a second protein complex ( I1 ) appeared .
Complex I has been identified as the Spl gene product based on interaction with anti-Spl antibodies ( Fig .
7A , lane 3 ) .
When anti-AP2 antibodies were included in the binding reaction , the complex II was retarded , indicating that it is formed by the interaction of GSA1l with transcription factor AP-2 ( lane 4 ) .
Binding of Spl and AP-2 to oligonucleotide GSA1 can be disrupted by preincubation of the THP-1 cellular extract with unlabeled GSAl oligonucleotide in a 50-fold molar excess ( data not shown ) .
Antibodies against transcription factor PU.1 caused no specific supershift of the complex pattern .
Incubation of probes GSA2 and GSA3 with nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells resulted in the formation of one major protein complex ( Fig .
7B , C ) .
The intensity of this complex ( I ) is markedly increased when nuclear extracts from PMAtreated THP-1 cells are used .
Antibodies specific to Spl transcription factor incubated with the reaction mixture resulted in a decrease in the intensity of complex I and the appearance of a new complex with high molecular weight .
These data indicate that Sp1 binds to both oligonucleotides GSA2 and GSA3 .
Preincubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies against PU.1 did not lead to a change in the complex pattern using GSA3 as a probe .
Addition of antibodies against PU.1 to the reaction mixture with GSAZ resulted in a faster migrating complex of unknown origin .
Antibodies against AP2 did not change the complex pattern with GSAZ and GSA3 .
Speci-ficity of the Spl or AP-2 interaction with the respective DNA sequences was demonstrated by competition experiments using a 50-fold molar excess of non-Jlabeled doublestranded oligonucleotides ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION In the present study , we characterized the transcriptional regulation of the LAL gene in response to PMA .
As a cellular model we used the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 which upon specific stimulation can differentiate to a macrophage like state thus mimicking monocyte/ macrophage differentiation ( 13 , 14 ) .
We have demonstrated that phorbol esters , which are known to activate protein kinase C and stimulate monocytic differentiation ( 13 ) , do increase the level of lysosomal acid lipase mRNA transcripts .
The increase in LAL mRNA resulted in higher amounts of LAL enzyme within the cells .
Although the upregulation of the LAL mRNA is mostly due to strong activation of the promoter , additional posttranscriptional mechanisms like mRNA stability appear to contribute to differentiation -dependent increase in LAL mRNA .
The LAL promoter region is ( G + C ) -rich and lacks a classical TATAbox .
Therefore , the identification of multiple transcription start points was not surprising ( 28 ) .
However , unlike certain other TATAJless housekeeping promoters , the LAL promoter is regulated in a differentia-tion-dependent manner .
Using deletion derivatives of the promoter region the minimal PMA-inducible promoter sequence has been identified between nucleotides -107 and -182 .
Within this 76-bp promoter region one AP-2-like consensus sequence is present .
The activity of the transcription factor AP-2 is subject to distinct regulatory mechanisms .
Phorbol esters and signals that elevate cyclic AMP concentration have been found to induce AP-2 activity without affecting AP-2 mRNA and protein expression ( 29 ) .
Additionally , an alternatively spliced AP-2 gene product may negatively regulate AP-2 activity ( 30 ) .
In addition to the AP-2 site , we found two Spl binding sites within the PMA-responsive region of the LAL gene promoter .
Spl has been shown to interact with the TATA-box binding protein ( TBP ) -associated protein TAF 110 and , in cooperation with another TBP -associated protein , TAF 250 , activate transcription ( 31 , 32 ) .
Therefore , Spl is thought to be important in the regulation of many TATA-less promoters and may function to recruit or stabilize the TFIID initiation complex via a `` tethering factor `` ( 33 , 34 ) .
Even though Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed , its role in cell-specific and regulation processes has been implicated ( 35-37 ) .
In particular , its involvement in the TATAdess promoters of the myeloid specific integrin CD11b ( 36 ) , the monocyte specific gene CD14 ( 37 ) , and the neural specific acetylcholine receptor a ; gene ( 38 ) have been analyzed .
We have demonstrated that these two transcription fac- Ries e al .

tors , AP-2 and Spl , play an important role in phorbol estermediated expression of the LAL gene .
Deletion of the AP-2 site ( -171 ) decreased both basal and PMA-enhanced promoter activity by 40 % .
Elimination of the Spl binding site ( -140 ) did not further suppress promoter function , whereas deletion of the second Sp1 site ( -114 ) resulted in an almost complete elimination of both basal and PMA-induced promoter activity .
In order to provide evidence for the involvement of the Spl and AP-2 sites in LAL gene transcription , we analyzed LAL promoter activity in THP-1 cells after co-transfection with Spl and AP2 expression plasmids and an LAL promoter/ luciferase construct .
Cotransfection of Spl with the shortest fully inducible LAL promoter construct pLAL3 resulted in a 2.7-fold augmentation of promoter activity .
Co-transfection of AP2 expression vector also increased promoter activity of the pLAL3 ( -182/ +67 ) con-struct , but to a lesser extent ( 1.8-fold ) .
Simultaneous transfection of THP -1 cells with Sp1 and AP-2 led to a 3.5-fold increase of promoter activity .
These experiments indicate that Spl and AP-2 act in concert to enhance LAL transcription .
2132 Journal of Lipid Research Volume 39 , 1998 Using gel mobility shift assays , we have shown that PMA treatment of THP-1 cells led to an increased binding of several nuclear factors to labeled oligonucleotides derived from the PMA-responsive LAL promoter region .
Binding activities interacting with this region responsible for PMA inducibility have been characterized as transcription factors Spl and AP-2 by experiments using specific antibod-ies .
In contrast to AP-2 , little is known about a possible role of Spl in PMA-mediated transcriptional regulation .
In a recent study , Biggs , Kudlow , and Kraft ( 39 ) have shown that Spl is implicated in the PMA-induced expression of the WAF1/ CIP1-gene in U937 cells .
They demonstrated that a reporter plasmid containing multiple Spl sites upstream of a TATA-box is induced by PMA in the U937 cell line .
D'Angelo et al .
( 40 ) reported that thromboxane receptor gene expression in K562 cells is enhanced by PMA due to increased Spl protein levels and Spl binding to a C-rich element .
To prove whether Spl protein levels increase during PMA treatment of THP-1 cells , we carried out immunoblots of THP-1 nuclear extracts and found that the amount of Spl protein was significantly higher in PMA-induced THP-1 cells compared 6loz ' o ) Aepy uo qsanB Aq Buo'jj [ 'mmm wou ; papeojumog ASBMB JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH to resting THP-1 cells ( data not shown ) .
These data and our results demonstrating the necessity of protein synthesis for PMAenhanced LAL gene expression suggest that induction is partially mediated by an increased Spl synthesis and binding to the promoter in a differentiation-dependent manner .
In recent studies there is evidence that Spl expression itself is regulated .
Thus Spl levels decrease during myo-genesis , which contributes to the repression of GLUTI gene transcription ( 41 ) .
In addition , Spl binding alone is not sufficient for maximal PMA enhancement of LAL gene expression .
However , the response of the LAL gene to PMA may involve interactions of Spl and AP2 .
It has previously been reported that Spl interacts with other transcription factors , like Egr-1 ( PDGF-expression ) , AP2 { acetylcholine receptor a ; gene expression ) , or YYl ( 38 , 42 , 43 ) .
Therefore , it is conceivable that under some circumstances Spl can act as a transcriptional enhancer or modulator independent of its action in transcriptional ini-tiation .
Phosphorylation and glycosylation of Spl in various cell types may also contribute to variable modes of regulation of promoter activity ( 44 , 45 ) .
In conclusion , the results of our study indicate : 1 ) induction of LAL gene expression in the macrophage cell line THP-1 depends on protein kinase C activity and new protein synthesis ; 2 ) transcription factors Spl and AP2 may act in concert to enhance transcription of the LAL gene after PMA treatment ; and 3 ) LAL activity is partly regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms .
Furthermore , our data suggest that far from being a ubiquitously expressed `` housekeeping `` transcription factor , Spl is a dynamically regulated enhancer playing a critical regulatory role for numerous genes .
In the future , it will be interesting to see whether potential Spl binding sites in other monocytic genes also contribute to specific regulation during the monocyte/ macrophage differentiation process .
