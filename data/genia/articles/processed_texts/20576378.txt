The Proteasome Regulates Receptor-mediated Endocytosis of Interleukin-2* Received for publication , August 31 , 2000 , and in revised form , October 10 , 2000 Published , JBC Papers in Press , October 13 , 2000 , DOI 10.1074/jbc.MO07991200 Aixin Yu and Thomas R. Malek $ From the Department of Microbiology and Immunology , University of Miami School of Medicine , Miami , Florida 33136 Recent studies have increasingly implicated the proteasome in the regulation of cell surface receptors .
In the present study , we investigated the role of the proteasome for ligand-dependent endocytosis and degradation of the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) complex .
Proteasome inhibitors impaired internalization of IL-2IL-2R and prevented the lysosomal degradation of this cytokine .
Based on time-course stud-ies , proteasome activity is primarily required after initial endocytosis of the IL-2IL-2R .
Proteasome function was also necessary for the lysosomal degradation of IL-2 internalized by IL-2R that were comprised of cytoplasmic tailless B- or ye-subunits , suggesting that the target protein for the proteasome is independent of either the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-2R B- or ye-subunits and their associated signaling components .
Therefore , a functional proteasome is required for optimal endocytosis of the IL-2R/ligand complex and is essential for the subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL-2 , possibly by regulating trafficking to the lysosome .
The high affinity interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) ' is comprised of three subunits ; an « -chain , which functions solely in IL-2 binding , and B- and common y ( yc ) -chains that function in both ligand binding and signal transduction ( 1 ) .
IL-2 promotes oligomerization of these subunits and activation of a number of receptor-associated signaling molecules , including Janus kinase ( Jak ) -1/3 , signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) 5/3 , p56lck , and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase that is recruited by the Shc-adapter protein ( 2 ) .
Another immediate consequence of IL-2-IL-2R interaction is ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis of the receptor-ligand complex .
In T lymphocytes , 50 % of the receptor-ligand complex is internalized within 10-15 min ( 3 , 4 ) .
Ligand-induced endocytosis of the IL-2R is primarily dependent upon the cytoplasmic tail of yc ( 5 , 6 ) .
Studies that have followed the fate of these proteins indicate that IL-2Ra recycles to the plasma membrane from an early endosomal compartment , whereas the B- and ye-subunits as well as IL-2 traffic to the lysosome , where they are degraded ( 7 ) .

Within the immune system , the proteasome is essential for production of peptides for MHC class I antigen presentation .
The proteasome also has a well described role in the degradation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins , including the elimination of misfolded proteins as well as controlling the levels of certain transcription factors or cell cycle regulatory proteins ( 8 ) .
Most proteins destined for degradation are targeted to the proteasome by ubiquitination ( 9 ) .
More recent studies have implicated ubiquitination in the internalization of a growing list of cells surface receptors ( 10 , 11 ) , suggesting a possible role for the proteasome in regulating the levels of cell surface receptors .
In the present study we have used specific inhibitors to explore the potential role of the proteasome for endocytosis and degradation of the complex .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cells and Reagents-1FlyecWT ( 6 ) , 1F1yc284 ( 12 ) , and CXBt ( 18 ) have been described previously .
Activated T cells were prepared by the culture of C57BI/6 spleen cells with anti-CD3 for 48 h as described previously ( 14 ) .
E-64 , MG132 , PSI , and antipain were obtained from Peptide International , Inc. ( Louisville , KY ) , lactacystin from Calbio-chem-Novabiochem Corp. ( San Diego , CA ) , and chloroquine from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO ) Internalization Assay-Cells ( 10 X 10°/ml ) were incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 5 % fetal calf serum ( 14 ) ( complete medium ) at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence of 50,000 cpm/ml human IL-2 ( specific activity ~20-40 uCi/ug ) that was radiolabeled with Na ' `` !
using Iodo-gen precoated tubes ( Pierce Chemical Co. , Rockford , IL ) according to the manufacturer 's instruction .
The cells were then washed three times with cold Hank 's balanced salt solution .
Unless otherwise indicated , all inhibitors were added at 50 uM final concentration to the cells just after these washes .
In the case of lactacystin , the cells were also cultured with this proteasome inhibitor for 2 h in complete medium and cooled on ice for 15 min prior to treatment with '*I-labeled IL-2 .
Dimethyl sulfoxide ( Me , S80 ) , which was the solvent for all the proteasome inhibitors , was added to the control cells at a concentration of < 1 % .
The IL-2-pulsed cells ( 4 X 10°/ml ) were then cultured in complete medium at 37°C using a water bath in 1 ml of medium/tube using 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes .
At the indicated times , the cells were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 X g for 15 s. Protein released in the supernatant was precipitated by addition of one-fourth volume of 50 % trichloroacetic acid .
The trichloroacetic acid soluble counts represented internalized IL-2 that was degraded .
The cell pellets were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.01 M sodium citrate , 0.14 M NaCl , pH 2 buffer for 2 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 15 s at 14,000 x g in a microcentrifuge .
The radioactivity that remained associated with the cells after this low pH buffer wash represented the internalized ( / ) IL-2 whereas the portion of radioactivity in the pH 2 buffer supernatant represented cell surface-associated ( S ) IL-2 .
Before shifting the cells to 37 °C , usually 75-85 % of the cpm was cell-surface associated .
The I/S ratio was calculated at the indicated time points .
The pH 2-resistant material at time 0 ( ¢ , ) was considered nonspecific material and was subtracted from I .
Western Blot Analysis-1F1ycWT cells were extracted in buffer containing 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( 1 mM ) , leu-peptin ( 10 ug/ml ) , aprotinin ( 10 ug/m !
1 ) , iodoacetamide ( 10 mM ) , sodium orthovanadate ( 1 mM ) , and sodium fluoride ( 1 mM ) as described previously ( 15 ) and precipitated with anti-STATS5 antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc. , Santa Cruz , CA ) associated to protein G-Sepharose .

Effect of a proteasome inhibitor on receptor-mediated endocytosis of IL-2 .
1F1ycWT cells were pulsed with IL-2 , treated with MG132 ( 50 pM ) , and cultured for 3 h at 37 °C .
At the indicated time , the fraction of IL-2 that was on the cell surface ( A ) , intracellular ( B ) , or released into the medium ( C ) was determined .
Data are the mean + S.D .
of three determinations .
The precipitated material was resolved by 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis under reducing conditions , transferred to nitrocellulose , and blocked by incubation with 5 % nonfat dried milk in PBS , pH 7.2 , ( 5 % milk ) for 1 h. The nitrocellulose was subsequently incubated with either anti-phospho-STAT5 ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) or anti-STAT5 antisera in 5 % milk for 90 min , washed three times with PBS containing 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig for 60 min followed by washing twice with PBS containing 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 and once with PBS alone .
Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL Western blotting detection reagents ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
RESULTS Effect of Proteasome Inhibitors on the Internalization and Degradation of IL-2-After IL-2 binds to the high affinity IL-2R , ~50 % is detected intracellularly ( I/S = 1 ) within 10-15 min ( 8 , 4 ) , and a similar rate of internalization has been noted for IL-2R-bearing EL4 , including 1F1yeWT ( Fig .
1 and Refs .
6 and 13 ) .
By 45 min , ~70 % of the * `` I-labeled IL-2 was detected intracellularly without appreciable degradation ( Fig .
1 , B and C ; Refs .
6 and 13 ) .
To test whether proteasome function was required for receptor-mediated endocytosis of IL-2 , 1F1yeWT cells were treated with * `` I-labeled IL-2 in the cold , and internalization of the surface-associated IL-2 was initiated by culturing the cells at 37°C in the absence or presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( Fig .
1 ) .
During the first 10-15 min , the MG132 minimally affected the initial internalization of IL-2 as measured by the initial loss of cell surface IL-2 ( Fig .
1A ) or the accumulation of intracellular IL-2 ( Fig .
1B ) .
However , an altered I/S ratio was evident for 1F1ycWT 45 min after initiation of endocytosis when the cells were cultured with either MG132 or the highly proteasome specific inhibitor lactacystin ( Fig .
24 ) .
This effect was because of an increased level of surface IL-2 that was evident for the MG132-treated cell by 30 min ( Fig .
14 ) .
The altered endocytosis by MG132 and lactacystin was specific as the I/S ratio was not affected when 1F1ycWT were treated with the calpain inhibitor antipain or the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 ( Fig .
24 ) .
After 60 min in culture , an obvious fraction of the IL-2 that was initially associated with the 1F1yeWT cells was detected in the culture supernatant , and at this and all subsequent time points , > 90 % of this released IL-2 was soluble in trichloroacetic acid , consistent with its degradation to small peptides .
The small amount of IL-2 released during the first 30 min in culture was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid , which most likely reflected the release of IL-2 from the IL-2R prior to its endocytosis .
Surprisingly , MG132 substantially inhibited the degradation of IL-2 ( Fig .
1C ) .
Like MG132 , the related peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor PSI , but not antipain or 6-64 , prevented the degradation of IL-2 ( Fig .
2B ) .
This finding suggests that the inhibition by these two peptide aldehydes is caused by effects on the proteasome rather than effects on lysosomal cysteine proteases or calpains .
Again , the highly proteasome-specific inhibitors lactacystin and clasto-lactacystin B-lactone ( not shown ) also inhibited the degradation of IL-2 ( Fig .
2B ) .
Dose-response studies indicated that 2-5 um MG132 , PSI , or lactacystin were required for inhibition of 50 % degradation of IL-2 ( Fig .
2C ) .
This concentration of inhibitors is consistent with those required to inhibit the proteasome ( 16-18 ) .
Collectively , these data indicate that proteasome function is necessary for normal receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation of IL-2 .
Relationship Between the Proteasome and Lysosome for Internalization and Degradation of IL-2-Previous studies have demonstrated that upon internalization of the IL-2-IL-2R complex , IL-2 traffics to the lysosome and is degraded ( 3 , 4 , 7 ) .
We confirmed that degradation of IL-2 by 1F1ycWT occurred in the lysosome as its degradation was inhibited by 50 um chloroquine ( Fig .
3A ) .
The peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor MG132 was even a somewhat more potent inhibitor of degradation of IL-2 .
During the first 15 min of culture , time-course studies revealed that MG132 only minimally blocked internalization of IL-2 ( Figs .
14 and 3B ) .
However , after a 20-30 min culture in the presence of MG132 , internalization of IL-2 reached a maximal level , and after that time the fraction of surface and intracellular IL-2 remained constant .
By contrast , chloroquine , which directly inhibits lysosomal function , showed much lower capacity to affect the internalization of IL-2 with consistently a higher I/S ratio than MG132-treated cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
This finding in conjunction with the complete inhibition of degradation of IL-2 by proteasome and lysosome inhibitors suggests that impairment of IL-2 internalization by the proteasome inhibitors may be secondary because of the blockade in trafficking of IL-2 to the lysosome , preventing the degradation of IL-2 .
Proteasome Function Is Not Required for Initial Internalization of IL-2-From the preceding data , only the initial endocytosis of IL-2 was not influenced by MG132 .
However , this apparently normal internalization might simply be related to a short delay for MG132 to effectively block the proteasome .
To directly test whether the entry of IL-2 into the cells was unaffected by proteasome inhibitors , 1FlycWT cells were pretreated with proteasome inhibitors prior to initiation of receptor-mediated endocytosis ( Table I ) .
When analyzing the continuous internalization of IL-2 for 45 min ( Table I , Experiment 1 ) , the fraction of surface and intracellular IL-2 was comparable for cells pretreated with either the Me ; SO vehicle or proteasome inhibitors .
In the latter two experiments ( Table I , Experiments 2 and 3 ) , the cellular distribution of IL-2 was assessed 3 h after initiation of endocytosis of IL-2-pulsed cells .
In this scenario , most of the cell-associated IL-2 was found in 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Proteasome and Endocytosis of IL-2 383 A B C - # - Lactacystin -a- MG132 5 100 100- -*- PSI !

TaBLE I Pretreatment of 1F1ycWT with proteasome inhibitors does not impair initial internalization of IL-2 In Experiment 1 , 1F1ycWT cells were pretreated with MG132 ( 50 uM ) for 60 min at 87°C prior to adding '**I-labeled IL-2 without washing .
The cells were further cultured at 37 °C for 45 min , and cell surface- and intracellular-associated cpm were determined .
In experiments 2 and 3 , 1F1ycWT cells were pretreated with PSI ( 50 uM ) or lactacystin for 120 min at 37 °C and then cooled on ice for 15 min .
The cells were then pulsed with ***T-labeled IL-2 at 4 °C for 30 min .
After washing , the cells were cultured at 37°C for 180 min with further addition of PSI or lactacystin .
70-85 % of the cpm were cell surface-associated prior to initiation of endocytosis as determined by cells maintained at 4 °C ( Experiment 1 ) or by assay before shifting to 37 °C ( Experiments 2 and 3 ) .

an intracellular fraction , a result that was essentially identical to experiments where the proteasome inhibitor was added simultaneous to initiation of internalization .
Because lactacystin is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor , the accumulation of intracellular IL-2 in the presence of this agent ( Table I , Experiment 3 ) strongly supports the notion that initial endocytosis of IL-2 was unaffected by blockade of the proteasome .
After a 30-min culture of IL-2-treated 1Fl1ycWT , usually 65-75 % of the cell-associated IL-2 was detected as an intracellular fraction of ligand ( see Figs .
1B and 2B and Ref .
6 ) .
The addition of MG132 at this time resulted in inhibition of degradation of IL-2 to a level that was comparable when MG132 was added at the initiation of the culture ( Fig .
44 ) .
Substantially less inhibition was noted when MG132 was added 60 min after initiation of endocytosis of IL-2 , a time when degradation of IL-2 is beginning to be detected in the control cells .
Furthermore , when compared with Me ; SO vehicle-treated cells , an accumulation of intracellular IL-2 occurred when MG132 was added at culture initiation ( ¢ , ) or 30 min later .
The increased fraction of intracellular IL-2 was most prominent when the proteasome inhibitor was delayed for 30 min , as normal levels of IL-2 were allowed to first be internalized before blocking the proteasome .
Delayed addition of MG132 similarly affected the degradation of ** `` I-labeled IL-2 by C57BL/6 T blasts ( Fig .
4B ) , demonstrating that proteasome function for IL-2 degradation was not unique to only IL-2R-bearing EL4 cells , but was also required for a normal population of T cells .
Collectively , these data suggest that blockade of the proteasome inhibits a relatively early step in the intracellular traffic of the IL-2IL-2R complex , but a step later than required for the initial endocytosis of the receptor-ligand complex .
IL-2-induced Signaling , Degradation of IL-2 , and Proteasome Function-Normal internalization of IL-2 is dependent upon the cytoplasmic tail of the ye-subunit of the IL-2R ( 5 , 6 ) .
For the 1F1yc284-transfected variant of EL4 , which expresses wild-type IL-2R a- and B-chains but the cytoplasmic tailless ye-chain , the rate of internalization of IL-2 is ~2-3-fold slower than 1FlycWT , with a corresponding lower fraction of degraded IL-2 after 2-3 h in culture ( Table II and Ref .
6 ) .
By contrast , the CX t-transfected variant of EL4 , which expresses wild-type IL-2Ra and -yc , but a cytoplasmic tailless B-chain , demonstrated essentially normal rates of internalization and degradation of IL-2 ( Ref .
13 and Table II ) .
Importantly , MG132 very efficiently inhibited the degradation of the fraction of IL-2 that was internalized by the IL-2R on 1F1yc284 or CXt ( Table II ) .
These findings indicate that the proteasome-dependent pathway for degradation of IL-2 is independent of the cytoplasmic tail of IL-2RB or -yc , including the respective IL-2R-asso-ciated signaling molecules .
610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 384 Proteasome and Endocytosis of IL-2 Several studies have implicated the proteasome in the regulation of Jak-STAT signal transduction , including IL-2-induced activation of STATS5 ( 19 , 20 ) .
In 1F1yeWT , IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STATS ( Fig .
5A , lane 1 versus 3 ) , and upon extended culture without IL-2 , the level of phosphorylated STATS5 was considerably reduced ( Fig .
5A , lane 3 versus 5 and 7 ) .
Furthermore , as expected , MG132 stabilized IL-2-induced activation of phosphorylated STAT5 , which was especially evident after 2 h in culture ( Fig .
5A , lane 7 versus 8 ) .
To investigate whether this enhanced signaling might be related to the proteasome-dependent blockade of the IL-2 degradation pathway , we examined the ability of delayed addition of MG132 to potentiate STAT5 phosphorylation in 1FlyecWT ( Fig .
5B ) .
Because the IL-2 degradation pathway was nearly completely inhibited even when MG132 was administered 30 min after initiation of IL-2-IL-2R endocytosis , we reasoned that the stabilized phosphorylation of STAT5 by MG132 would also be evident after delayed addition of MG132 , if these two processes were related .
However , unlike degradation of IL-2 , MG132 was MG132 A mors ?

Thus , proteasome regulation of IL-2 signaling and subsequent endocytosis appear to be unrelated .
DISCUSSION The proteasome is not typically considered as a key regulator of ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis .
In this study we show a mandatory role for the proteasome for normal endocytosis of and subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL-2 .
Blockade of the 26 S proteasome did not affect the initial endocytosis of IL-2 , but was necessary for sustained endocytosis and was essential for lysosomal degradation of IL-2 .
These findings add to increasing evidence that rapid ligand-induced internalization of cell surface IL-2-IL-2R complexes occurs by a novel endocytic mechanism .
For example , although IL-2R and transferrin receptors are both detected in early endosomes , blockade of coated-pit internalization of the transferrin receptor had minimal effect on the internalization of IL-2-IL-2R ( 21 ) , suggesting that these molecules may utilize distinct pathways to traffic to the early endosome .
Furthermore , recently a critical endocytic signal has been identified within a 9-amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic tail of yc ( 6 ) , and this region lacks tyrosine or dileucine motifs that target receptor-ligand complexes to clathrin-coated pits , which are typically necessary for entry into the early endosome compartment .
It was possible to delay addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to a point ( 30 min ) where substantial endocytosis of IL-21IL-2R occurred and still potently inhibit lysosomal degradation of IL-2 .
This finding raises the possibility that proteasome function may be solely required for trafficking internalized IL-2 from an endosomal compartment to the lysosome .
In this scenario the capacity of proteasome inhibitors to impair internalization of IL-2IL-2R may be secondary to this regulatory role in trafficking .
We can not , however , rule out a broader role for proteasome function for endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex .
The molecular target for proteasome action in IL-2IL-2R endocytosis has not been established .
Generally , polyubiquiti-nation of intracellular proteins targets them for recognition and proteolytic degradation by the proteasome .
As a number a studies have demonstrated ubiquitination of cell surface receptors ( 10 ) , we considered the possibility the cytoplasmic tail of IL-2R B- or ye-subunits might be critical targets for the proteasome .
Importantly , proteasome function was still required for lysosomal degradation of IL-2 after internalization by IL-2R that contained cytoplasmic tailless B- or ye-subunits .
So far , we have also been unsuccessful in directly demonstrating that these subunits are modified by ubiquitin ( data not shown ) .

Effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on IL-2-induced STATS activation .
1FLycWT cells were treated with IL-2 ( 400 units/ml ) at 4 °C for 30 min in complete medium , washed three times , and cultured at 37 °C for the time indicated ( time assayed ) .
MG132 ( 50 uM ) or Me , S8O ( 0.5 % ) was added at the initiation ( A ) ( ¢ , ) of this 87 °C culture or delayed ( B ) , as indicated .
Nonidet P-40 extracts were prepared from these cells , precipitated with anti-STAT5 antiserum , and subjected to Western blot analysis using antiserum specific for phosphotyrosine-STATS5 ( upper panel ) .
The blot was stripped and reprobed with antiserum to STATS protein ( Lower panel ) to verify the levels of STATS in each lane .
Data are representative of three experiments .
610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Proteasome and Endocytosis of IL-2 385 These results strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic portion of the IL-2R or their associated signaling components are unlikely to be targets for the proteasome .
Consistent with this notion , we showed distinct kinetic requirements for proteasome function for IL-2-mediated endocytosis and IL-2-induced STATS tyrosine phosphorylation .
A number of cell surface receptors are ubiquitinated upon ligand activation .
In mammalian cells , the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( 22 ) , growth hormone receptor ( 23 ) , TCR , ( 24 ) , and c-kit ( 25 , 26 ) were among the first receptors shown to undergo ligand-induced ubiquitination of their cytoplasmic tails .
In these cases , the lysosome appears to be the primary target for degradation of these receptors .
In Saccha-romyces cerevisiae the G-protein coupled a-factor receptor undergoes enhanced mono- or short chain ubiquitination upon binding « -factor , which facilitates endocytosis and subsequent degradation by the lysosome ( 27 , 28 ) .
The use of yeast defective in ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes established a role for this protein modification in endocytosis ( 27 , 28 ) .
So far , there has been little direct evidence that proteasome function is involved in this process , and it has been suggested that ubiquitination may serve as a targeting sequence for entry into the endocytic pathway leading to down-regulation of the cell surface receptor ( 10 ) .
One exception appears to be endocytosis of the growth hormone receptor .
Similar to our results on the IL-2R , proteasome activity appears to be required for ligand-induced endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of growth hormone receptor that is independent of ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of growth hormone receptor ( 29 ) .
The fate of the receptor-associated ligand was not determined in that study .
Proteasome inhibitors have also been reported to affect the levels of platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( 22 ) and the Met kinase receptor ( 30 ) , but these effects have not been ascribed to regulation of the endocytic pathway .
If our findings on the IL-2R are generalized , perhaps the role for proteasome function in regulating these cell surface receptors is to gain entry into a cellular compartment for lysosomal/vacuolar degradation that is independent of ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor .
