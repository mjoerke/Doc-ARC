8 Chronic Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Infection of Myeloid Cells Disrupts the Autoregulatory Control of the NF-kB/Rel Pathway via Enhanced IxBa Degradation CARMELA DeELUCA , *** `` ANNE ROULSTON , *+ ANTONIS KOROMILAS , ** MARK A.

A direct temporal correlation exists between HIV infection and the appearance of NF-xB DNA-binding activity in myelomonoblastic PLB-985 cells .
To examine the molecular basis of constitutive NF-xB DNA-binding activity in HIV-1-infected cells , we analyzed the phosphorylation and turnover of IxBa protein , the activity of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) and the intracellular levels of NF-KB subunits in the PLB-985 and U937 myeloid cell models .
HIV-1 infection resulted in constitutive , low-level expression of type 1 interferon ( IFN ) at the mRNA level .
Constitutive PKR activity was also detected in HIV-1-infected cells as a result of low-level IFN production , since the addition of anti-IFN- « /B antibody to the cells decreased PKR expression .
Furthermore , the analysis of IxBa turnover demonstrated an increased degradation of IxBa in HIV-l-infected cells that may account for the constitutive DNA binding activity .
A dramatic increase in the intracellular levels of NF-B subunits c-Rel and NF-B2 p100 and a moderate increase in NF-B2 p52 and RelA ( p65 ) were detected in HIV-l-infected cells , whereas NF-B1 p105/p50 levels were not altered relative to the levels in uninfected cells .
We suggest that HIV-1 infection of myeloid cells induces IFN production and PKR activity , which in turn contribute to enhanced IxBa phosphorylation and subsequent degradation .
Nuclear translocation of NF-KB subunits may ultimately increase the intracellular pool of NF-KB/IBa by an autoregulatory mechanism .
Enhanced turnover of IBa and the accumulation of NF-B/Rel proteins may contribute to the chronically activated state of HIV-l-infected cells .
CD4* myeloid cells are important targets for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection and are susceptible to infection at multiple stages of differentiation ( 38 , 53 ) .
HIV infection of mononuclear phagocytes in vivo occurs predominantly in terminally differentiated macrophages in tissues such as the lymph nodes , lung , skin , and brain ( 23 ) , although HIV-1-infected myeloid precursors in the bone marrow have been identified in AIDS patients ( 46 ) .
Since HIV is not cytopathic to myeloid cells , these cell populations may act as reservoirs of HIV within the bone marrow and other tissues , facilitating virus spread and accelerating disease progression ( 33 ) .
Physiological changes associated with HIV infection of myeloid cells include functional alterations in chemotaxis , phagocytosis , lytic activity , antigen presentation , and cytokine gene expression ( reviewed in references 23 and 53 ) .
Generally , constitutive cytokine mRNA expression is not observed in chronically HIV-infected THP-1 , PLB-985 , and U937 cell models .
Nonetheless , increases in cytokine mRNA levels are seen after cellular stimulation by inducers such as lipopolysaccharide or Sendai virus ( 13 , 14 , 37 , 63 ) .
HIV infection of the promonocytic U937 cells induced phenotypic changes associated with cellular differentiation , leading to increased virus expression ( 19 , 29 , 40 , 41 , 45 ) .
Previously , we demonstrated that chronic HIV infection of PLB-985 cells leads to morphological characteristics and expression of myeloid-specific surface markers ( CD14 and c-fms ) * Corresponding author .

5183 consistent with irreversible differentiation along the monocytic pathway ( 52 ) .
The expression of surface receptors associated with differentiation and activation may lead to increased responsiveness to bacteria and cytokines secreted by neighboring cells .
Chronic HIV infection of myeloid cells may also alter signaling pathways that modulate the host inflammatory re-sponse .
One of the important transcriptional pathways involves the NF- « B/Rel proteins , a family of ubiquitous transcription factors that participates in various biological processes including immunological responsiveness , lymphoid differentiation , and cell growth regulation ( reviewed in reference 53 ) .
NF- « B/ Rel proteins are present in most cell types in an inactive cytoplasmic form , complexed to inhibitory IxB proteins .
NF-kB DNA-binding activity can be induced following exposure to a wide variety of activating agents including cytokines , T-cell mitogens , bacterial products , viruses , and double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) ( 3 , 4 , 17 ) .
Activation of NF-kB requires the disruption of IxB-DNA-binding subunit interactions , which is mediated by phosphorylation of IxB followed by proteolytic degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( 1 , 12 , 15 , 39 , 61 ) .
The cloning of several NF-xB genes showed that these proteins share a region of homology , termed the NF-kB/Rel/dorsal region , which spans approximately 300 amino acids at the amino terminus of each protein .
Two of the DNA-binding subunits are synthesized as inactive cytoplasmic precursor proteins .
The product of the nfkbl gene is a 105-kDa protein which gives rise to a 50-kDa DNA-binding subunit , p50 ( 10 , 25 , 36 ) .
The nfkb2-encoded p100 precursor is very similar to p105 , 5184 DELUCA ET AL .
and its mature DNA-binding form is p52 .
The other NF- « B/ Rel DNA-binding proteins are not processed from precursors : c-Rel is an 85-kDa protein , which in addition to the NF- « B/ Rel/dorsal region , contains a unique 300-amino-acid carboxy terminal domain that is related to RelA ( p65 ) ( 11 , 24 ) encoded by the rela gene .
The carboxy termini of c-Rel and RelA contain two activation domains similar to VP16 ( 5 , 20 , 44 , 59 ) .
RelB is also structurally similar to RelA and c-Rel but lacks trans-activating potential and has an elongated amino-terminal segment ( 57 ) .
The IxB family of proteins is defined by its ability to interact with NF- « B/Rel subunits , sequestering them in the cytoplasm , possibly in association with cytoskeletal proteins ( 9 ) .
The IxB proteins so far identified contain between five and seven repeats of a 33-amino-acid sequence termed the ankyrin motif .
The nuclear localization signal in the NF-kB/Rel/dorsal domain of the DNA-binding subunit is necessary for this interaction and is masked by IxB in the complex ( 8 , 21 ) .
Members of the IxB family include , IxBa , IxBB , IxBy , the proto-onco-gene bei-3 , and the precursors p105 and p100 ( reviewed in reference 7 ) .
We and others have previously demonstrated that productive virus infection causes sustained NF-kB DNA-binding activity in chronically HIV-infected monocytic cell lines ( 2 , 42 , 47 , 50 , 52 , 60 ) .
A direct temporal correlation exists between HIV infection and the appearance of NF-kB DNA-binding activity in the myelomonoblastic PLB-985 cells ( 51 , 52 ) .
One common point at which the infection cycle of many viruses may overlap is with the generation of dsRNA during replication which may in turn activate the dsRNA-dependent kinase ( PKR ) ( 34 , 58 ) .
PKR is induced by interferon ( IFN ) and is activated by binding to dsRNA molecules synthesized during viral infection .
In addition to a well-characterized effect on host translation , PKR is implicated in the activation of NF-kB DNA-binding activity in vitro and in vivo .
PKR has been shown to phosphorylate IxBa and activate NF- « B DNA-binding activity in cellular extracts ( 27 ) .
Furthermore , NF-kB DNA-binding activity is not activated by dsRNA [ poly ( rl ) : poly ( rC ) ] in HeLa cells depleted of PKR by a novel antisense method ( 30 ) .
In order to examine the molecular basis of constitutive NF-kB DNA-binding activity , we analyzed the expression of individual NF-kB subunits , IxBa turnover , and PKR expression in the PLB-985 and U937 cell models .
Our results demonstrated increased intracellular levels of NF- « B subunits c-Rel and NF- « B2 and increased turnover of IxBa in HIV-1-infected cells .
We also identified in HIV-1-infected cells increased levels of PKR protein and activity which was elevated by constitutive low-level IFN production .
The addition of anti-IFN- « /B antibody to the cells decreased PKR by 48 h after the addition .
We suggest that HIV-1 infection of myeloid cells induces IFN production and PKR activity , which in turn contributes to enhanced IxBa phosphorylation and subsequent degradation .
Nuclear translocation of NF-kB subunits may ultimately increase the intracellular pool of NF-kB/IxBa by an autoregulatory mechanism .
The increased pool of NF- « B/IkxBa may contribute to the chronically activated state of HIV-1-infected cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture .
Myelomonoblastic PLB-985 and U937 cells and PLB-IIIB and U9-IIIB cells , infected with HIV strain IIIB , were maintained in RPMI 1640 ( GIBCO , Life Technologies Inc. , Grand Island , N.Y. ) supplemented with 5 % Fetal Clone ( Hyclone , Logan , Utah ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 10 pg of gentamicin ( Schering Canada , Pointe Claire , Quebec , Canada ) per ml .
The cells were stimulated with either 50 ng of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ; Sigma ) per ml , 10 ug tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ; R & D Systems ) 1,000 IU of IFN ( Schering Canada ) per ml or 1,000 new units ( NU ) of anti-leukocyte IFN anti J. ViroL .
body ( anti-IFN-/8 ) ( Sigma ) per ml in the medium .
Cells were seeded at 5 X 10° cells per ml and stimulated for different times depending on the experiment .
S1 nuclease analysis .
Total cellular RNA from PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells was isolated at specific time points after infection according to a modified guanidium isothiocyanate procedure .
Si-mapping analysis was performed with 40 ug of RNA and 5 ' [ y-* `` P ] JATP end-labeled probes specific for IFN-a1 and IFN-B as previously described ( 22 ) .
Nuclease-resistant DNA/RNA hybrid molecules were resolved on a 6 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel , quantified by laser densitometry , and expressed as relative RNA levels .
Assay for PKR activity .
PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells were concentrated to 10 `` cells per ml and incubated with Sendai virus ( 100 hemagglutinating units per ml ) for 90 min at 37°C .
Mock-infected cells were concentrated as described above but incubated without virus .
The cells were subsequently diluted to 10° cells per ml and incubated for a total of 6 h. The cells were then lysed with lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 7.5 ] , 50 mM KCI , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 2 mM MgCl , , 1 % Triton X-100 , 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride [ PMSF ] , 3 g of aprotinin per ml , 1 mg of leupeptin per ml , and 1 pg of pepstatin per ml ) .
Extracts ( 100 ug ) were incubated with anti-PKR antibody for 2 h at 4°C .
Anti-mouse immuno-globulin G-agarose beads were added to the extracts and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4°C .
The beads were washed four times with high-salt buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 7.5 ] , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 % Triton X-100 , 0.2 mM PMSF , 3 ug of aprotinin per ml , 1 g of leupeptin per ml , 1 mg of pepstatin per ml , 20 % glycerol ) followed by three washes with low-salt buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 7.5 ] , 100 mM KCI , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithic-threitol , 0.2 mM PMSF , 3 pg of aprotinin per ml , 1 pg of leupeptin per ml , 1 ug of pepstatin per ml , 20 % glycerol ) .
PKR activity was induced by incubating the beads with 0.1 g of poly ( rC ) ( Pharmacia ) per ml in 5 % kinase buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.7 ] , 250 mM KCI , 10 mM MgCl , , 25 mM B-mercapto-ethanol ) for 10 min on ice .
The beads were then incubated at 30°C for 30 min with [ y-*P ] JATP ( ICN ) to detect autophosphorylation .
PKR was solubilized with 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer and run on an 8 % polyacrylamide gel .
The gel was fixed with 10 % methanol-5 % acetic acid for 30 min , dried , and exposed to X-ray film .
The intensities of the PKR bands detected by autoradiography were quantified by laser densitometry ( Pharmacia ) .
Northern ( RNA ) blot analysis .
Total RNA ( 10 to 20 pg ) was electrophoresed in a 1 % denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane ( Hybond-N ; Amersham ) with a Vacu-Gene blotting system ( Pharmacia ) .
RNA was cross-linked to the membrane in a UV Stratalinker 2400 ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif. ) and prehybridized overnight in prehybridization solution { 25 mM KPO , ( pH 7.4 ) , 5x SSC ( 750 mM NaCl , 75 mM sodium citrate [ pH 7.0 } ) , 50 % deionized formamide , 50 ug of salmon sperm DNA ( Boehringer GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) } and 5 % Denhardt 's solution containing 0.5 % Ficoll 400 ( Sigma ) , 0.5 % ( wt/vol ) polyvinylpyrrolidine , and 0.5 % ( wt/vol ) bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) at 42°C in a hybridization oven .
The probes used included a 0.8-kb PKR fragment generated by EcoRI digestion of plasmid pé8wt-peDNAT NEO ( 26 ) , a 1.1-kb fragment isolated from pSVK3-IxBa by EcoRI digestion ( 6 ) , and a 1.1-kb fragment derived from pB-actin by PsfI digestion .
The probes were labeled to approximately 10° epm/pg with the oligolabeling kit ( Pharmacia ) and [ a- `` °P ] JCTP .
Hybridization occurred overnight at 42°C in prehybridization solution supplemented with 10 % ( wt/vol ) dextran sulfate ( Pharmacia ) and approximately 5 x 10 `` cpm of labeled probe .
The blots were washed , wrapped in plastic , and exposed to X-Omat film ( Kodak ) at -70°C .
Western blot analysis of NF-xB/IxB proteins .
Whole-cell extracts were prepared by resuspension in Nonidet P-40 ( NP-40 ) lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 8.0 ] , 60 mM KCI , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.5 mM PMSF , 0.01 mg each of leupeptin , pepstatin , and aprotinin per ml ) .
After incubation on ice for 10 min , cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C .
Cell extracts ( 10 to 20 ug ) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane .
The membranes were blocked for a minimum of 2 h in 5 % skim milk and incubated overnight in 5 % milk containing affinity-purified , anti-peptide polyclonal antisera ( dilutions ranged from 1:250 to 1:1,000 ) .
Antisera were prepared as described previously ( 43 ) .
Antibody AR27 or anti-p105-N was raised against a peptide ( amino acids 2 to 15 ) at the most-N-terminal region of p105 and recognizes both p105 and p50 ; AR43 or anti-p100-N was generated against a peptide at the N terminus of p100 ( amino acids 2 to 17 ) and recognizes both p100 and p52 ; AR28 recognizes the C terminus of p65 ( amino acids 537 to 550 ) ; AR22 recognizes the C terminus of c-Rel ( amino acid 573 to 587 ) .
AR20 recognizes the N terminus of IxBa ( aa2 to 16 ) .
Antiserum that recognizes the N terminus of RelA ( p65 ) was purchased from Santa Cruz , Inc .
The membranes were rinsed four times in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and incubated with a secondary antibody , flu-orescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit ( 1:1,000 ; Amersham ) for 1 h at room temperature and then rinsed again four times in PBS .
The enhanced chemiluminescence-Western blotting ( immunoblotting ) detection system ( Am-ersham ) was used according to the manufacturer 's instructions to visualize the specific signals .
Autoradiograms were scanned by laser densitometry , and the intensity of each band is presented relative to the levels in uninfected , unstimulated cells for NF-kB subunits ; quantification of IxBa « was expressed as a percentage of the IxBa remaining relative to the amount at time zero .
Values for turnover rates were plotted on a semi-log scale , and the best fit curves were determined .
The experiments were repeated a minimum of three times , and representative autoradiograms are shown .

Kinetics of IFN mRNA expression in PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells after infection with Sendai paramyxovirus .
Total cellular RNA was extracted from PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells at hours 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , and 24 following Sendai virus infection .
S1 mapping was performed with 40 ug of cellular mRNA and an [ y- `` °P ] ATP end-labeled IFN- « 1- and IFN-B-specific probes , as previously described ( 22 , 51 ) ; signals corresponding to RNA-DNA hybrids were identified by autoradiography , and the intensities of the bands corresponding to the IFN- « 1 and IFN-B signals were scanned by laser densitometry and plotted in terms of relative mRNA levels .
The kinetics of IFN-a1 are illustrated and are qualitatively similar to results obtained for IFN-B .
Detection of IxBa « phosphorylation .
Cell extracts were prepared as described for Western blot analysis and treated with 0.5 U of potato acid phosphatase in PIPES [ piperazine-N , V ' -bis ( 2-ethanesulfonic acid ) ] buffer ( 10 mM PIPES [ pH 6.0 ] , 0.5 mM PMSF , 5 g each of leupeptin , pepstatin , and aprotinin per ml ) or with 0.5 U of potato acid phosphatase in PIPES buffer plus inhibitor mix ( 10 mM NaF , 1.5 mM Na , MoO , , 0.4 mM Na ; VO , , 0.1 ug of okadaic acid per ml ) at 37°C for 60 min .
Equivalent amounts of protein ( 50 pg ) were resolved on a 5 to 13 % gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and were transferred to nitrocellulose .
IxBo and phosphorylated IxBa were visualized with the previously described affinity-purified IxBa antibody ( AR20 ) .
In other experiments , PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells in log phase growth were concentrated to 10° cells per ml and were incubated with 25 uM MG132 ( Myogenics ) or with an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) for 0 to 120 min , as indicated .
Cell extracts were electrophoresed on a SDS-5 to 13 % polyacrylamide gradient gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis .
Phosphorylated IxBa was detected as a distinct more slowly migrating band with a monoclonal IxBa « peptide antibody ( 49 ) .
NF- « kB/Rel REGULATION IN HIV-1-INFECTED MYELOID CELLS 5185 RESULTS Altered kinetics of IFN gene expression .
HIV infection leads to the dysregulation of numerous cytokine genes ( 53 ) .
To examine whether IFN production was affected , a kinetic analysis of IFN-a1 and IFN- gene transcription was performed with PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells .
S1-mapping analysis with probes corresponding to IFN-B and IFN- « 1 demonstrated that chronically infected PLB-IIIB cells constitutively expressed low levels of IFNa1 mRNA and IFN- mRNA ( 51 , 52 ) .
When coin-fected with Sendai virus , PLB-IIIB cells exhibited an altered pattern of IFN gene expression compared with de novo Sendai virus infection of PLB-985 cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
Sendai virus-induced IFN mRNA from PLB-IIIB cells increased at 1 h postinfection ( p.i . )
, reached a peak at 4 to 6 h p.i .
, and then decreased to constitutive levels by 10 h p.i .
In contrast , Sendai virus-induced IFN mRNA from PLB-985 cells was initially detected at 6 h p.i .
and reached a peak at 10 to 16 h p.i .
( Fig .
1 ) .
This experiment demonstrated three distinct alterations in IFN induction : ( i ) a constitutive level of transcription in chronically HIV-1-infected PLB-IIIB cells ; ( ii ) rapid induction kinetics in Sendai virus-infected PLB-IIIB compared with that in PLB-985 cells ; and ( iii ) a lower relative amount of IFN mRNA in Sendai virus-induced PLB-IIIB cells than in PLB-985 cells .
Analysis of PKR expression and activity .
The dsRNA-dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) is induced by IFN and activated in the presence of natural or synthetic dsRNA .
Since recent studies demonstrated that PKR activated NF-kB DNA-binding activity in cellular extracts ( 27 , 30 ) , we sought to examine whether PKR activity may be elevated in HIV-1-infected cells and may play a role in IxBa phosphorylation and turnover .
Northern blot analysis demonstrated a constitutive level of PKR mRNA expression in PLB-IIIB cells ( Fig .
2A , lanes 4 to 6 ) compared with that in PLB-985 cells ( Fig .
2A , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
Also , the expression of PKR mRNA in PLB-IIIB cells increased in response to PMA for 8 h ( Fig .
2A , lane 5 ) but not in response to Sendai virus infection ( Fig .
2A , lane 6 ) .
In other experiments , PKR mRNA levels peaked at 24 h p.i .
in PLB-985 cells , while in PLB-IIIB PKR mRNA levels were constitutively elevated ( data not shown ) .
Similarly , the level of PKR protein was increased by more than fivefold in PLB-IIIB cells com A - mRNA B Protein C_ Activity 10 2 3 405006 1 2 3 0 4 1 2 3 4 « iin swe » ~ ” h pra w # - Ct » came numa Induction ILP SIIU P SI I U S I IU S I LU S I IU S I PLB985 - PLBIIIB PLB985 PLBIIIB PLB985 PLBIIIB FIG .

Analysis of PKR mRNA and protein expression levels in PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells .
( A ) Total cellular RNA was isolated from PLB-985 ( lanes 1 to 3 ) or PLB-IIIB ( lanes 4 to 6 ) cells that were untreated ( U ) , PMA treated ( P ) , or Sendai virus infected ( S ) for 8 h. RNA was separated on a 1 % denaturing agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light ( 310 nm ) .
After RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane , the blot was probed with a PKR cDNA probe .
The position of the 2.5-kb PKR RNA transcript is indicated by an arrow .
( B ) PLB-985 cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or PLB-IIIB cells ( lanes 3 and 4 ) that were untreated ( U ) or infected by Sendai virus for 6 h were separated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , and immunoblotted with a monoclonal PKR antibody .
The arrow indicates the band corresponding to the 68-kDa PKR protein .
( C ) PLB-985 cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or PLB-IIIB cells ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , untreated ( U ) or infected by Sendai virus for 6 h ( S ) , were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antisera against PKR .
PKR activity was induced by poly ( rI ) : poly ( rC ) and incubated with [ y-*2P ] ATP to detect autophosphorylation .
The signal was visualized by autoradiography .

Modulation of PKR protein expression levels in PLB-985 and PLB-TIB cells .
( A ) PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells were treated with PMA ( P ) or TNF-a ( T ) or were Sendai ( 8 ) virus infected for 0 h ( lanes 1 and 6 ) , 6 h ( lanes 2 to 4 and 7 to 9 ) , or 24 h ( lanes 5 and 10 ) .
PKR protein expression is identified by an arrow .
( B ) PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells were grown in the presence or absence ( + or - , respectively ) of IFN or anti-IFN- « /B ( IFN-Ab ) for 24 or 48 h. The immunoblot was reprobed for actin to confirm equal protein loading per lane .
PKR and actin are identified by arrows .
pared with that in PLB-985 ( Fig .
2B ) .
Finally , analysis of PKR autocatalytic activity demonstrated that PKR activity was increased in extracts from PLB-IIIB cells compared with that in PLB-985 cells ( Fig .
2C ) .
Darker exposures revealed that PKR activity was detectable in PLB-985 cell extracts stimulated by Sendai virus infection ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that HIV-infected myeloid cells have increased PKR activity compared with that in similarly treated PLB-985 cells .
Addition of neutralizing IFN antibody downregulates PKR levels .
Kinetic analysis revealed that PKR protein levels were inducible in PLB-985 but were essentially constitutive in PLBIIIB cells ( Fig .
2 and 3A ) .
Protein levels were increased in PLB-985 cells at 18 to 24 h p.i .
( Fig .
3A , lane 5 ) but only weakly elevated at 6 h p.i .
( Fig .
3A , lanes 2 to 4 ) .
In contrast , PLB-IIIB cells had high PKR levels at various time points between 0 and 48 h after treatment with different activators ( Fig .
3A , lanes 6 to 10 , and Fig .
3B , lanes 5 to 9 , 11 and 12 ) .
Since IFN expression may lead to elevated levels of PKR in chronically infected cells , abrogating IFN signaling by the addition of a neutralizing antibody may decrease PKR expression .
To determine whether anti-IFN- « /B antibody would affect PKR expression levels in PLB-IIB cells , 1,000 NU of anti-leukocyte IFN ( anti-IFN « /B ) J. ViroL .
antibody per ml was added to the cultures .
PLB-IIIB cells incubated in the presence of anti-IFN antibody for 48 h had dramatically reduced levels of PKR protein ( Fig .
3B , lanes 11 to 13 ) ; this effect of anti-IFN antibody required more than 24 h to be established , since changes in PKR levels were not detected in PLB-IIIB cells after 24 h of treatment with anti-IFN antibody ( Fig .
3B , lanes 8 and 9 ) .
Together , these results demonstrate that chronic HIV-1 infection of PLB-985 cells resulted in low-level IFN production , which in turn stimulated constitutive expression of PKR .
IxBa turnover in PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells .
Next , the turnover of IxBa in PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells was examined by immunoblot analyses ( Fig .
4 ) .
Although IxBa levels were slightly elevated in HIV-1-infected cells compared with those in uninfected cells , the turnover rates were consistently higher in PLB-IIIB cells ( compare PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB panels ) .
These data were all normalized to the B-actin protein levels to ensure that overall protein degradation rates were not affected in the different extract preparations .
In HIV-1-infected cells , immunoblot analysis of IxBa levels demonstrated that the total pool of IxBa turned over with a half-life of about 95 min in cycloheximide-treated cells , whereas in uninfected cells the t , , , of IxBa was about 165 min ( compare Fig .
4A , lanes 1 to 6 for PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB ; plotted in Fig .
4B ) .
PMA-plus-cycloheximide treatment reduced the half-life of IxBa in PLB985 and PLB-IIIB cells to 100 and 50 min , respectively ( Fig .
4A , lanes 7 to 12 ; Fig .
4B ) .
Treatment of both PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB with TNF- « in the presence of cycloheximide resulted in rapid inducer-mediated degradation of IxBa with a t1 , , of < 10 min ( Fig .
4 , lanes 13 to 18 ; Fig .
4B ) .
Interestingly , a 30-kDa AR2Z0 immunoreactive band exhibiting degradation kinetics similar to that of IxBa was present in PLB-985 cells but not in PLB-IIIB cells .
The 30-kDa form appears to be a degradation product of IxBa , although we can not rule out the possibility of a differentially spliced product or a distinct immunoreactive species .
Similar turnover kinetics for IxBa in U937 cells and HIV-1-infected cells were also observed ( Fig .
5 ) .
In the presence of cycloheximide , IxBa had half-lives of approximately 120 and 80 minutes in U937 cells and U9-IIIB cells , respectively ( compare Fig .
5A , lanes 1 to 6 for U937 and UYQ-IIIB ; Fig .
5B ) .
As seen with PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells , TNF- « reduced the turnover rate to < 10 min for both cell types ( Fig .
5A , lanes 7 to 12 ; Fig .
5B ) .
Interestingly , the addition of anti-IFN antibody to the culture medium for 48 h altered the kinetics of IxBa turnover in PLB-IIIB cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
Immunoblot analysis of IxBa levels demonstrated that the total pool of IxBa degraded with a half-life of about 90 min in cycloheximide-treated PLB-IIIB cells , whereas in HIV-1-infected cells treated with anti-IFN antibody , the t , , , of IxBa was about 160 min , similar to the turnover rate in uninfected PLB-985 cells .
These results indicate that constitutive PKR activity in HIV-1-infected cells may contribute to the overall turnover of the IxBa pool and that downregulation of PKR by interfering with the IFN-inductive signal may alter IxBa turnover in PLB-IIIB cells .
IxBa mRNA expression in PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells .
We next sought to determine if the increased turnover rate of IxBa in HIV-infected cells was accompanied by increased transcription of the IB gene , as described previously ( 28 ) .
IxBa mRNA expression was examined by Northern blot analyses and normalized to actin levels ( Fig .
7 ) .
IxBa ( MAD-3 ) mRNA levels were equivalent in unstimulated PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells normalized to actin ( Fig .
7A , lanes 1 and 2 and 6 and 7 ) and were inducible by PMA treatment or Sendai virus infection by approximately 25-fold in PLB-985 and by 5- to 15-fold in PLB-IIIB ( Fig .
7 , lanes 3 to 5 and 8 to 10 ) .

IxBa turnover in PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells .
( A ) PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells were cultured in the presence of cycloheximide and were either untreated , PMA treated , or TNF-a treated for the times ( in minutes ) indicated .
Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and visualized with affinity-purified IxBa antibody ( AR20 ) .
The band corresponding to IxBa is identified by an arrow .
( B ) Autoradiograms were scanned by laser densitometry and the intensity of each band is presented in terms of the percentage of IxBa remaining in cells untreated or treated with either PMA ( P ) or TNF- « ( T ) compared with the total IxBa at time zero .
iments , IxBa mRNA levels were maximally stimulated 2 h after treatment in PLB-IIIB cells , and by 24 h after induction , IxBa mRNA levels were the same as those in unstimulated cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , in response to increased NF-kB binding activity in HIV-1-infected cells , the IxBa/MAD-3 gene was transcriptionally induced in both cell types , although with different kinetic profiles .
Also , in PLB-IIIB cells , induction of IxBa transcription appears to be decreased in response to various stimuli ( Fig .
7 ) .
This modulation in the level of gene induction may reflect differences in the relative abundance and transactivation potential of the constitutive NF- « B binding activity in HIV-1 infected cells ( see below ) .
Phosphorylation of IxBa « .
To examine the comparative degree of phosphorylation of IxBa in PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB , IxBa was analyzed at different times following treatment with TNF-a or PMA ( Fig .
8 ) .
Phosphorylated IxBa was detected by immunoblot analysis in both PLB-985 cells ( data not shown ) and PLB-IIIB cells treated with TNF-a as early as 1 or 2 min after stimulation ( Fig .
8A , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The more slowly migrating band , present only in TNF- « -stimulated cells , was lost when extracts were incubated with potato acid phosphatase ( Fig .
8A , lane 5 ) and was restored when extracts were incubated with phosphatase and phosphatase inhibitors ( Fig .
8A , lane 6 ) , thus confirming that the upper band represents a phosphorylated form of IxBa .
PMA treatment for 4 min did not result in the appearance of phosphorylated IxBa ( Fig .
8A , compare lanes 4 and 2 ) , indicating that TNF-a is a more potent inducer of IxBa phosphorylation than is PMA .

Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and visualized with affinity-purified IxBa antibody ( AR20 ) .

tion is also consistent with the limited effect of PMA on IxBa turnover ( see Fig .
4 ) .
Constitutive turnover of IxBa protein was increased in PLBIIIB compared with that in PLB-985 cells ( see Fig .
4 ) .
To determine if this increase was related to an enhanced constitutive phosphorylation in HIV-1-infected cells , the rate of accumulation of phosphorylated IxBa was analyzed in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( Fig .
8B ) .
By this approach , IxBa phosphorylation in PLB-985 ( Fig .
8B , lanes 1 to 6 ) and PLB-IIIB ( Fig .
8B , lanes 8 to 13 ) appeared to be similar .
Also , extracts from PLB-985 or PLB-IIIB cells ( Fig .
J. ViroL .
8B , lanes 7 or 14 ) incubated with DMSO for 2 h resembled control extracts , confirming that accumulation of phosphorylated IxBa was not due to DMSO treatment but rather to stabilization of the phosphorylated product by MG132 .
Interestingly , the 30-kDa IxBa-like band specific to PLB-985 was phosphorylated at time zero ( Fig .
8B , lane 1 , lower band ) ; at later times , two distinct slowly migrating forms of 30-kDa IxBa were detectable ( Fig .
8B , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
protein expression in PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells .
The altered kinetics of IxBa turnover in PLB-IIIB cells suggested that expression of NF- « B subunits may be similarly altered in HIV-1-infected cells .
In previous studies the composition of NF- « B-DNA complexes was analyzed ( 50 , 52 ) , but the relative abundance of different NF-kB subunits was not evaluated .
To examine the protein levels of various NF- « B DNA-binding proteins in HIV-1-infected and control PLB-985 cells , immunoblot analyses with NF- « B subunit-specific antibodies were performed and normalized by analysis of B-actin levels ( Fig .
9 and 10 ) .
Protein extracts were prepared from PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells induced for 8 , 16 , or 22 h with PMA or TNF- « .
A representative summary of the immunoblot analyses of NF-kB1 and NF- « kB2 proteins is shown in Fig .
9 and illustrates that the levels of NF-kB2 p100 and p52 ( Fig .
9A and B ) were higher in unstimulated PLB-IIIB cells than in unstimulated PLB-985 cells .
HIV-1-infected cells had approximately three- to fourfold more p100 and twofold more pS2 than uninfected PLB-985 cells .
NF- « B1 p105 and p50 levels ( Fig .
9C and D ) were not significantly increased .
Stimulation with PMA or TNF-a ( Fig .

Northern blot analysis of IxBa « ( MAD-3 ) mRNA levels in PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells .
Total cellular RNA was isolated from PLB-985 ( lanes 1 to 5 ) and PLB-IIIB ( lanes 6 to 10 ) cells that were untreated ( U ) , mock infected ( M ) , PMA treated ( P ) , TNF- « ( T ) treated , or Sendai virus infected ( $ ) for 6 h. RNA was separated on a 1 % denaturing agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light ( 310 nm ) .
After RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane , the blot was first probed with an IxBa « cDNA probe .
The blot was subsequently stripped and reprobed with an actin cDNA probe .
The positions of the IxBa RNA transcript MAD-3 ( top panel ) and the actin transcript ( lower panel ) are identified by arrows .

twofold higher in PLB-IIIB cells than in PLB-985 cells , and the levels were not dramatically altered by PMA or TNF-a treatment ( Fig .
10C and D ) .
In contrast , the levels of c-Rel were at least eightfold higher in infected cells than in noninfected cells ( Fig .
10A and B ) .
Following induction with PMA or TNF- « , c-Rel levels were up to 50-fold higher than the levels detected in unstimulated PLB-985 cells and 2- to 3-fold higher than the levels of c-Rel protein in unstimulated PLB-IIIB cells ( Fig .
10A and B ) .
Interestingly , stimulation with PMA or TNF-a for 22 h ( Fig .
10B and data not shown ) led to sustained expression of c-Rel in PLB-IIIB cells , whereas in PLB-985 cells , c-Rel levels returned to control levels .
Other studies also demonstrated that NF- « B subunit expression was similarly increased in U9-IIIB cells and in U937 cells ; in addition , U9-IIIB cells exhibited increased levels of p105 and p50 ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that intracellular pools of NF-kB subunits are increased in chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cells .
DISCUSSION In this study we demonstrate that regulation of NF-kB/IkBa expression is altered in PLB-IIIB cells as a result of chronic HIV-1 infection : ( i ) constitutive expression of IFN mRNA and altered kinetics of IFN mRNA induction in response to Sendai virus infection were demonstrated in PLB-IIIB cells compared with those in PLB-985 cells ; ( ii ) PKR protein and enzymatic activity were increased in PLB-IIIB cells ; ( iii ) IxBa turnover was increased in HIV-1-infected cells compared with that in uninfected PLB-985 cells , in part because of PKR activity ; and ( iv ) increased levels of c-Rel and p100/pS52 proteins were de NF- « kB/Rel REGULATION IN HIV-1-INFECTED MYELOID CELLS 5189 tected in PLB-IIIB cells compared with those in PLB-985 cells .
The addition of anti-IFN- « /B antibody to the culture dramatically reduced the level of PKR expression in PLB-IIIB cells , thus demonstrating a role for low-level IFN production in the constitutive activation of PKR .
As demonstrated previously , PKR is capable of phosphorylating IxBa in vitro and inducing NF-kB-binding activity ( 27 , 30 ) .
The persistent inductive signal provided by PKR may contribute to the constitutive NF- « kB-binding activity observed in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells .
On the basis of the selective increase in NF-kB subunits , nuclear translocation of NF-kB appears to ultimately increase the intracellular pool of NF-kB/IkBa by an autoregulatory mechanism .
The increased pool of NF- « xB/IxBa may contribute to the chronically activated state of HIV-1-infected cells .
Several studies have addressed the mechanism of NF-kB activation in HIV-1-infected cells .

Cell extracts isolated by detergent lysis from PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells left untreated ( 0 ) or stimulated with PMA for 8 or 22 h ( RW ) were resolved by SDS-PAGE , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , and blotted with NF- « B-specific antisera : p100 ( AR40 ) ( A ) , p52 ( AR43 ) ( B ) , p105 ( AR27 ) ( C ) , and p50 ( AR27 ) ( D ) .
The specific signals were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( Amersham ) .
Autoradiograms were scanned by laser densitometry , and the intensity of the each band is plotted in terms of relative protein levels .
Because of affinity differences between NF-xB antibodies , the relative amounts of the different proteins can not be compared .
quired for ongoing transcription of integrated HIV provirus in monocytic cells chronically infected with HIV-1 ( 24a ) .
Increased transcription and processing of the p105 precursor may be one mechanism to increase intracellular pools of NF-kB in chronically infected U937 cells ( 42 ) and may be mediated by the HIV protease which cleaves p105 to generate a 45-kDa DNA-binding subunit in vitro and in HIV-infected T cells ( 48 ) .
Although we also found elevated expression of p105 protein in chronically infected U937 cells , significant increases in p105 protein were not seen in PLB-IIIB cells .
These cells , although both myeloid precursor cells , differ in their state of differentiation , suggesting that NF-kB may be developmentally regulated .
HIV infection of the monocytic THP-1 cell line resulted in two populations of chronically infected cells ( 47 ) .
Nuclear ex tracts from productively infected cells contained increased p50-p65 heterodimer-binding activity , whereas extracts from cells expressing low levels of virus ( restricted expression ) displayed only p50 homodimer-binding activity .
In another study , increased NF-kB p50-p65-binding activity was also observed in HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages but not in the promonocytic cell line U937 , suggesting that a certain level of myeloid maturation is required prior to NF-kB induction ( 60 ) .
The activity of specific lysosomal proteases expressed in my-elomonocytic cells , including primary monocytes , HL-60 , and certain clones of U937 and THP-1 cells , resulted in carboxy-terminal cleavage of RelA ( p65 ) .
The generation of a truncated form of RelA resulted in the formation of Rel-A containing protein-DNA complexes with transcriptional activity that re voL .

Analysis of c-Rel and RelA ( p65 ) expression in PLB-985 and PLBIIB cells .
Cell extracts isolated by detergent lysis from PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells left untreated ( U ) ( 0 ) , treated with PMA ( P ) for 16 h , or treated with TNF-a ( T ) for 22 h ( WN ) were resolved by SDS-PAGE , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , and blotted with NF- « B-specific antisera : c-Rel with and without PMA ( AR22 ) ( A ) , c-Rel with and without TNF- « ( B ) , p65 with and without PMA ( AR28 ) ( C ) , and p65 with and without TNF- « ( AR28 ) ( D ) .
sembled NF- « kB1 p50 homodimers ( 18 ) .
The activity of lysosomal proteases was decreased after cellular exposure to agents that induced monocytic but not granulocytic differentiation .
Although RelA cleavage was thought to occur only during cell extract preparation in vitro , this enzymatic activity may nonetheless restrict virus expression in immature myeloid cells in vivo , by a mechanism independent of transcription , thus accounting for cell populations exhibiting restricted or productive patterns of HIV-1 replication ( 18 ) .
An N-terminal RelA-specific antibody was used to examine whether PLB-IIIB or PLB-985 cells contained the truncated form of RelA ; no evidence of truncated RelA was obtained with the PLB-IIIB/ PLB-985 extracts or isolation procedure used in this study ( data not shown ) .
Modulation of intracellular NF- « B protein levels represents a control mechanism for enhanced activation of NF- « xB-regu-lated gene expression .
Enhanced levels of NF- « xB2 and c-Rel in PLB-IIIB ( and NF-kB2 , NF-kB1 , and c-Rel in U9-IIIB ) cells may result in increased intracellular pools of latent NF- « B .
c-Rel expression was particularly augmented in HIV-infected cells and exhibited increased responsiveness to PMA and NF- « kB/Rel REGULATION IN HIV-1-INFECTED MYELOID CELLS 5191 TNF-a stimulation .
We previously reported the appearance of an unidentified 90- to 100-kDa protein upon HIV infection of PLB-985 cells .
This protein bound the IFN-B PRDII NF- « B site with high affinity ( 50-52 ) as well as the HIV-1 NF- « B sequence .
Given the dramatic increase in c-Rel activity and the induction of c-Rel in response to TNF- « and PMA stimulation , these results raise the possibility that the 90-kDa protein is in fact c-Rel ( 50-52 ) .
The rel4 ( p65 ) gene is not known to be stimulated in response to mitogenic stimuli , including PMA ( 56 ) , and is not regulated by NF-kB ( 62 ) .
Our results are consistent with previous observations , since the levels of p65 were only moderately increased in the differentiated PLB-IIIB cells .
Increasing the intracellular levels of distinct NF- « B subunits would permit high levels of HIV long terminal repeat-directed gene transcription and would thus provide an environment for continued HIV replication ( 24a ) .
Furthermore , changing the relative abundance of NF- « xB would also be expected to alter host transcription since several studies have delineated differential transcriptional specificities of NF-kB homo- and het-erodimer combinations ( reviewed in reference 53 ) .
IxBa phosphorylation and turnover .
The level of IxBa protein was consistently lower in PLB-985 cells than in PLB-IIIB cells .
However , the pool of IxBa « in PLB-IIIB cells exhibited a higher rate of protein turnover .
Increased IxBa protein turnover has been documented in other HIV-1-infected myeloid cells ( 2 , 31 ) , suggesting one mechanism for increased constitutive NF-kB DNA-binding activity in HIV-1-infected cells ( 50 ) .
Using the proteasome inhibitor MG132 , we demonstrated the accumulation of phosphorylated forms of IxBa in both uninfected and HIV-1-infected cells , although only minor differences in the rates of accumulation were detected .
McEI-hinny et al .
also suggested that the increased turnover compensated for the elevated levels of IxBa protein seen in chronically HIV-1-infected U937 cells ( 31 ) .
Increased IxBa synthesis and turnover , coupled with the elevated levels of p100/ p52 and c-Rel , indicate a specific upregulation of the NF- « B/ IxBa autoregulatory loop in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells .
The observation that IxBa mRNA induction is decreased in PLBIIIB cells may be explained by the differential responsiveness of the IxBa promoter to NF-kB activation .
The IxBa promoter is transcriptionally activated by the NF-kB subunits RelA and p50 but to only a limited extent by c-Rel ( 28 ) .
While the levels of RelA are not significantly elevated in HIV-1-infected cells , c-Rel and p100/p52 account for a much greater proportion of the NF- « B pool .
Interestingly , the 30-kDa IxB-like band specific to PLB-985 cells degraded with kinetics similar to those of IxBa and exhibited a similar pattern of accumulation of phosphorylated forms in the presence of MG132 .
In fact , the 30-kDa protein accumulated two distinct phosphorylated species with time after the addition of the proteasome inhibitor .
The characteristics of this species are consistent with a degradation product of IxBa , although it could also represent an alternatively spliced form of IxBa or a distinct cross-reactive form .
Likewise , it is not known if the 30-kDa protein maintains the capacity for cytoplasmic retention of NF- « B .
If the 30-kDa form is a degradation product of IkBa , then the total pool of IxBa in PLB-985 cells would be greater than the pool in PLB-IIIB cells .
Role of PKR in virus-induced NF- < B-binding activity .
Both acute Sendai virus infection and chronic HIV infection lead to the induction of distinct NF-kB DNA-binding activities ( 50-52 ) , suggesting that the two viruses may converge on a signaling pathway distinct from that stimulated by PMA or TNF-a in the PLB-985 cell model .
One common point at which the infection cycle of these viruses may overlap is with the gener- 5192 DELUCA ET AL .
ation of dsRNA during viral replication , which may in turn activate PKR ( 34 , 58 ) .
PKR is induced by IFN and is activated by binding to dsRNA molecules generated during viral infection .
The antiviral activities of IFN are in part brought about by a PKR-mediated phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF-2a , which in turn inhibits protein translation .
Recent work has implicated PKR in the activation of NF-kB DNA-binding activity in vitro and in vivo ( 27 , 30 ) .
PKR phosphorylated IxBa and activated NF- « kB DNA-binding activity in cellular extracts ( 27 ) .
In PKR-depleted HeLa cells , NF- « B DNA-binding activity was not activated by dsRNA [ poly ( I ) : poly ( C ) ] ( 30 ) .
Increased PKR activity , acting upstream of IxBa phosphoryla-tion , is a possible mechanism by which constitutive activation of NF- « B may be perpetuated in chronically infected cells .
A recent study demonstrated that expression of wild-type PKR but not dsRNA-binding domain mutants of PKR stimulated HIV-1 long terminal repeat expression ( 35 ) .
Furthermore , PKR may induce NF- « B by two potential mechanisms : by phosphorylation of IxB or by inhibition of de novo IxB protein synthesis , thus preventing the shut-down of NF- « B-binding activity .
It is likely that other kinases and signaling pathways that ultimately influence NF- « B activation are also constitutively activated in chronically HIV-1-infected cells ( 53 ) .
HIV-1 Tat protein was previously shown to downregulate PKR activity in an HIV-infected T-cell line and in Tat-express-ing HeLa cells ( 55 ) , although this observation is not consistently observed .
Direct physical association between Tat and PKR in vitro and in vivo in HeLa cells and T lymphocytes has been recently reported , suggesting a potential mechanism by which HIV could suppress PKR activity specifically and the interferon system in general ( 32 ) .
In contrast , our results indicate that PKR mRNA , protein , and enzymatic levels are up-regulated in HIV-infected monocytic cells ; low-level IFN production in HIV-l-infected cells appears to be sufficient to activate PKR activity .
PKR may also be more active in HIV-infected cells since HIV TAR RNA can activate PKR kinase activity in vitro ( 16 , 54 ) .
Further studies are underway to directly implicate PKR in the modulation of HIV-1 infection and NF-kB activation .
