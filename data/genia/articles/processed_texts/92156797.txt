Davis-Jewish General Hospital ; and the McGill AIDS Centre McGill University , Montreal H3T 1E2 , Quebec , Canada Summary The effects of human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection on cellular differentiation and NF- « B DNA binding activity have been investigated in a new model of myeloid differentiation .
PLB-985 cells represent a bipotential myelomonoblastic cell population capable of either granulocytic or monocytic differentiation after induction with appropriate inducers .
By virtue of the presence of CD4 on the cell surface , PLB-985 cells were chronically infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB .
PLB-THB cells clearly possessed a more monocytic phenotype than the parental myeloblasts , as determined by differential staining , increased expression of the myeloid-specific surface markers , and transcription of the c-fms proto-oncogene .
NF- « B binding activity was inducible by tumor necrosis factor and phorbol myristate acetate in PLB-985 .
However in PLB-IIIB cells , constitutive expression of a novel NF-KB complex was detected , composed of proteins ranging between 70 and 110 kD .
These proteins interacted specifically with the symmetric NF-KB site from the interferon 3 ( IFN- ) promoter .
Mutations affecting the 5 `` guanine residues of the KB site were unable to compete for these NF- « B-related proteins .
Inducibility of endogenous IFN-B and IFN- RNA was also increased in PLB-IIIB cells .
These studies indicate that HIV-1 infection of myelomonoblastic cells may select for a more mature monocytic phenotype and that unique subunit associations of NF-kB DNA binding proteins may contribute to differential NF- « B-mediated gene expression .
he host range of the HIV-1 includes , in addition to CD4+* Th lymphocyte , cells of the monocyte/macro-phage lineage , and hematopoietic progenitor cells ( 1-3 ) .
Whereas Th cells are ultimately destroyed by HIV infection , infection of monocytic cells is not cytolytic , and these cells may act as reservoirs for viruses , thus contributing to virus spread to peripheral tissues including the lungs , brain , skin , and lymph nodes ( 3 ) .
Furthermore , HIV infection of myeloid cells results in the impairment of crucial functions involved in host defense , such as antigen presentation , chemo-taxis , cell killing , and cytokine release ( 4-6 ) .
HIV-1 infection of PBMC and monocytes/macrophages may have a dramatic impact on cellular gene expression and in particular on cytokine production ( 7-17 ) .
HIV infection does not generally lead to constitutive cytokine gene transcription and secretion ( 9 , 12 , 13 ) ; however , the cytokine response of HIV-infected cells to subsequent antigenic challenge by viruses , lipopolysaccharides , or poly ( I : C ) can be affected in 1 A. Roulston and M. D'Addario were equal contributors to this work .
HIV-infected cultures , often leading to increased expression of TNF and IL-1 ( 9 , 12 , 15-17 ) .
Cytokine release by HIV-infected cells may , in turn , alter the course of virus pathogenesis in vitro .
For example , treatment of cells with TNF- , IL-1 , or GM-CSF has been shown to increase gene expression driven by the HIV-1 LTR in transfection studies , and to stimulate virus multiplication in vitro ( 10 , 11 , 18-21 ) .
Cytokines , phorbol esters , virus infections , double-stranded RNA , and other mitogenic agents potentiate HIV replica-tion , in part via activation of NF-KB , a family of mitogen-and phorbol-ester-inducible DNA binding transcription factors which bind to and activate the HIV enhancer ( 22-24 ) .
NF-KB proteins bind to a decameric recognition sequence ( con-sensus 5-GGGRNNYYCC-3 ' ) present in the promoter regions of many cellular genes encoding immunoregulatory molecules ( II-2 receptor- , MHC class I antigens , and TNF receptor ) and cytokines ( II > 2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IFN- , TNF , and GM-CSF ) , as well as the enhancer domains of several viruses ( 22 ) .
To date , NF-KB induction has been characterized predominantly as a posttranslational event .

Phosphorylation of IKB appears to be a necessary requirement for dissociation of the heterotrimeric form of NF- « B ( 22 ) .
Recent cloning of the p65 and p50 subunits has revealed that the DNA binding region of both proteins shares homology with the c-rel proto-oncogene , ( 27-32 ) .
Furthermore these studies indicate that NF- « B induction may also be controlled at the level of transcription .
As a step toward understanding the consequences of HIV-1 infection on myeloid differentiation and cellular gene expression , we have investigated the induction of monocytic differentiation and NF- « B/rel activities in a new myelomonoblastic model of HIV-1 infection .
PLB-985 cells represent an immature blast population , capable of both monocytic and granulocytic differentiation ( 33 ) .
By virtue of CD4 expression on the cell surface , these cells were infected by HIV-1 strain IIIB and a chronically infected line ( PLB-IIIB ) was established .
Characterization of PLB-IIIB cells and NF- « B-related activity has demonstrated that HIV-1 infection of myelomonoblastic cells may select for a more mature monocytic phenotype , and that distinct subunit associations of NF-kB DNA binding proteins may contribute to developmental and inducible NF-KB-mediated gene expression .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture Myelomonoblastic PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells were maintained at 37°C , 5 % CO ; , in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco Laboratories , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 10 % FCS , 1 % glutamine , 1,000 IU/ml penicillin , 20 ug/ml streptomycin , and 1 ug/ml gen-tamycin .
Induction of exponentially growing cells was performed as described for the individual experiments .
Cells were treated with PMA ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) to a final concentration of 25 ng/ml , DMSO ( Aldrich Chemical Co. ) to a final concentration of 1.25 % , 2'-dibutyryl adenosine-3 ' , 5 `` -cyclic monophos-phate ( Bt2cAMP ; Sigma Chemical Co. ) to a final concentration of 750 uM , cis-retinoic acid ( RA ; Sigma Chemical Co. ) to a final concentration of 1 uM , and TNF-a to a final concentration of 100 U/ml .
Infection of PLB-985 Cells were infected using supernatant HTLV-IIIB virus obtained from U9-IIIB cells as previously described ( 34 ) .
P24 Antigen Determination Immunofluorescence .
- Production of HIV-1-specific p24 antigen was monitored over a period of 60 d by indirect immunofluorescence .
Cells were fixed on multibeveled slides with methanol/ace-tone ( 1:1 ) .
An aliquot of mouse anti-p24 antibody ( a gift from Dr. R. Gallo , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) diluted 1:1,000 in PBS was added to each well for 30 min .
After washing with PBS , goat anti-mouse-conjugated FITC antibody ( diluted 1:1,000 in PBS ) ( Caltag Laboratories , San Francisco , CA ) was added for 30 min .
Slides were washed with PBS plus 0.25 % Triton X-100 , air-dried , and mounted with glycerol .
ELISA .
- An ELISA ( Abbott Labs , North Chicago , IL ) was used to detect HIV-1 p24 in culture fluids , as per manufacturer 's in-structions .
Reverse Transcriptase Analysis At different time points after infection 1 ml of culture medium was centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 10 min .
Reverse transcriptase activity was evaluated without further virus concentration using ' H TTP incorporation into acid-precipitable nucleic acid ( 34 ) .
Analysis of RNA Total cellular RNA was isolated from untreated and PMA-treated PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells at specific times using a modified guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure ( 35 ) .
Total RNA ( 20 pug ) was electrophoresed in a 1 % denaturing formaldehyde gel , transferred to a nylon membrane , and hybridized with - [ `` P ] ATP nick translated probes at 42°C .
The probes include a 1.23-kb c-fms fragment generated by EcoRI cleavage of clone pc-fms 104 ( American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ) , a 1.1-kb B-actin frag-ment , a 4.5-kb c-myc fragment containing exons 2 and 3 produced by cleavage of plasmid pHSR-1 ( American Type Culture Collec-tion ) with Xbal , EcoRI , and HB10 , a 12.5-kb HIV-IIIB probe ( a gift from Dr. F. Wong-Staal , University of California at San Diego , La Jolla , CA ) .
The blots were washed at 55-60°C , air-dried , and exposed to X-OMAT film ( Kodak ) at -70°C .
The relative amounts of each signal were quantified by laser densitometry ( Ultrascan XL ; Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. , Piscataway , NJ ) .
Analysis of Surface Markers PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells treated with PMA or retinoic acid were analyzed for expression of myeloid specific surface markers using mAbs directed against CD13 , CD14 , CD33 , CD34 , and CD67 and analyzed in an Epics Profile II cytofluorograph ; ( Coulter Electronics , Hialeah , FL ) .
Whole Cell Extract Preparations Whole cell extracts ( WCE ) were prepared from untreated PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells or from cells treated for 6 or 15 h with PMA ( 25 ng/ml ) or TNF-a ( 100 U/ml ) as previously described ( 24 ) .
Gel Retardation Assays Cell protein in WCE buffer ( 0.1 M KCI ) , was preincubated with 5 ug of poly ( dI : dC ) as nonspecific competitor DNA for 10 min on ice .
P-labeled probe ( 0.2 ng ) consisting of the P2 oligonucleotide ( 5-GGGAAATTCCGGGAAATTCC-3 ' ) or the HIV enhancer ( 5'-AGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCC-3 `` ) was added to the protein , and incubated for 30 min at room temperature .
Competition assays were performed by incubating 125-fold excess of unlabeled competitor ( 25 ng ) with the protein for 10 min on ice , before the addition of radiolabeled probe .
UV Crosslinking Analysis For UV crosslinking analysis , assays were performed using double-stranded BUdR-substituted **P-labeled P2 or HIV oligonucleotide probes .
The crosslinking procedure was performed as previously described ( 36 ) .

752 NF- « B Activity in HIV-1-infected Monocytic Cells Analysis of IFN RNA Total RNA was isolated from uninduced or Sendai virus-induced PLB-985 or PLB-IIIB cells .
Cells were IFN- primed ( 250 U/ml ) , then treated with Sendai virus ( 2,000 HAU/ml ) for 6 h before RNA isolation .
IFN- and IFN-B-specific RNA was analyzed by PCR-mediated RNA phenotyping as previously described ( 9 ) using the IFN-ax ( sense : 5-CAATATCTACGATGGCTTCGC-3 ' and antisense 5'CAGAAGGCTCCAGCCATCTCT-3 ' ) and IFN-§ primers described previously ( 12 ) .
Results Isolation and Characterization of PLB-IIIB Cells .
PLB-985 cells were originally derived from a patient with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia and characterized as a diploid myelomonoblastic cell line ( 33 ) .
PLB-985 cells are capable of differentiation along the monocytic lineage after treatment with phorbol esters or along the granulocytic lineage after treatment with agents such as DMSO , dibutyryl cAMP , or retinoic acid ( 33 ) .
By virtue of the expression of CD4 on the surface of > 99 % of the cells , PLB-985 cells were infected with HIV-IIIB using culture fluids of HIV-1-infected U937 cells ( 34 ) .
At various times after infection , the cells and/or culture fluids were assayed for RT activity , p24 core antigen , and accumulation of viral RNA ( Fig .
1 ) .
After a lag period of about 10 d , the number of p24-positive cells increased rapidly together with levels of RT .
By day 18 , more than 50 % of the population was infected with HIV-1 ( Fig .
1 A ) .
Spliced and unspliced viral RNA species were easily detectable by Northern blot analysis using the HB1O0 probe ( Fig .
1 B ) .
During the next several weeks , the infected cell population underwent considerable death , presumably because of rapid virus multiplication .
Within 2 mo , a chronically infected cell population ( > 95 % positive for p24 antigen and < 4 % CD4* ) emerged that possessed a more mature monocytic phenotype than the immature parental blast cells ( compare Fig .
2 , A and C ) .
Phorbol ester treatment of PLB-985 produced an adherent , monocyte-like phenotype ( Fig .
2 B ) .
In contrast , PLB-IIIB without induction displayed several characteristics of monocyte maturation , including less basophilic cytoplasm , decreased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio , production of vacuoles , less visible nucleoli , ruffling at the cytoplasmic membrane , and lobularization of the nucleus ( Fig .
2 C ) .
PMA treatment of the PLB-IIIB cells further accentuated these features of the monocytic phenotype ( Fig .
2 D ) .

Total RNA ( 20 ug ) from PLB-985 ( lane 1 ) and/or PLB-IIIB ( lane 2 ) was electrophoresed in a 1 % formaldehyde gel , transferred to a nylon filter ( Amersham Corp. ) , and hybridized with the HB10 probe .

- Morphological characteristics of PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells .
PLB-985 cells ( 4 and B ) and PLB-IIIB ( C and D ) were fixed and differentially stained with Giemsa and examined by phase contrast microscopy .
Cells were either untreated ( A and C ) or PMA treated for 6 h ( B and D ) before staining .
mine whether the morphological alterations were accompanied by other changes in the PLB-IIIB phenotype , expression of myeloid-specific markers was determined by flow cytometry .
PLB-985 cells were < 5 % positive for the monocyte-specific marker CD14 , whereas the PLB-IIIB cells were about 20 % positive for the monocyte-specific CD14 surface antigen .
After PMA treatment , PLB-IIIB cells became > 60 % CD14 positive within 24 h ( Fig .
3 A ) .
The levels of other myeloid markers CD13 , CD33 , and CD67 remained at > 90 % .
Similarly 5-15 % of the cells were CD34 positive both before and after infection ( Fig .
3 B ) .
Expression of c-fms and c-myc Proto-oncogenes .
- Alteration of proto-oncogene expression is a recognized consequence of induction of differentiation in a variety of hematopoietic cell types ( 37 , 38 ) .
To examine the effects of HIV-1 infection on PMA-induced proto-oncogene expression , the steady state mRNA levels for c-myc and c-fms were measured at different times after PMA treatment of PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
In both cell types , c-mys RNA levels decreased about 2-3 fold by 24 h after PMA treatment ( Fig .
4 , upper ) .
In contrast , c-fms RNA was only weakly detectable by Northern blot analysis in PLB-985 cells before or after PMA induction ( Fig .
4 , middle , lanes 1-5 ) .
In untreated PLB-IIIB cells , c-fms RNA was present in low quantities .
This level of c-fms was induced more than 20-fold by PMA treatment ( Fig .
4 , middle , lanes 6-10 ) .
The level of B-actin RNA did not fluctuate significantly with induction or differentiation ( Fig .
4 , bottom ) .
After granulocyte induction of PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells with dibutyryl cAMP , no increase in c-fms was observed ( data not shown ) .
Finally , morphological and histochemical studies demonstrated that PLB-IIIB cells were nonresponsive to inducers of granulocytic differentiation , indicating that the cell population had irreversibly differentiated along the monocytic lineage ( data not shown ) .
Induction of NFB Binding Activity in PLB-IIIB Cells , Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between monocyte maturation and the expression of NF- « B DNA binding activity ( 39-41 ) .
More recently , NF-KB has been shown to represent a family of rel-related DNA binding proteins involved in both transcriptional control and oncogen-esis ( reviewed in references 22 , 27-32 ) .
We therefore sought to examine the relationship between HIV infection , monocytic differentiation , and activation of the NF- « B/rel transcription complex in this new myelomonoblastic model of HIV-1 infection .

the P2 oligonucleotide which consists of two copies of the NF-KB site found in IFN- ( PRDII site , -64 to -55 ) and human c-rel ( -28 to -18 ) or the HIV enhancer oligonucleotide which contains two NF- « B-binding sites found in the HIV-1 LTR ( ~105 to -80 ) .
In PLB-985 cells , multiple protein-DNA complexes were induced by 5 or 16 h of PMA or TNF treatment .
Both inducers appeared to be equally effective in stimulating NF- « B-DNA binding activities ( Fig .
5 A , lanes 1-3 and 7-9 ) .
In PLB-IIIB cells , a distinct pattern of protein-DNA complex formation ( complex A ) was detected consisting of strong constitutive P2 DNA binding ac-tivity ; formation of slowly migrating complexes ; and weak inducibility of this DNA binding activity by either PMA or TNF ( Fig .
5 A , lanes 4-6 and 10-12 ) .
A similar profile was observed using the HIV enhancer sequence as probe although about fivefold less complex A was detected with this probe ( Fig .
5 B ) .
In competition experiments , both the P2 oligonucleotide and the HIV enhancer oligonucleotide were able to compete effectively for the TNF-induced NF- « B binding activities in PLB-985 cells ( Fig .
6 A ) .
However , in PLB-IIHB cells only the P2 probe ( Fig .
6 B , lanes 2 , 5 , and 8 ) competed efficiently for the slower migrating constitutive A complex .
The HIV enhancer competed weakly for this DNA binding activity ( Fig .
6 B , lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 ) .
In dis 755 Roulston et al .
sociation rate analysis , complex A dissociated from the radiolabeled probe with a T ; , of < 4 min in the presence of excess P2 oligonucleotide , whereas addition of excess HIV enhancer failed to dissociate the A complex ( Ty > 30 min ) ( Fig .
7 ) .
Thus , the proteins involved complex A bound preferentially to the 5-GGGAAATTCC-3 ' site .
These proteins had a > 20-fold higher affinity for P2 sequences than for HIV enhancer sequences .
To evaluate the sequence specificity of complex A binding , mutational analysis of the NF-KB sites was performed .
Mutations that altered the 5° guanine residues of the HIV or P2 oligonucleotides completely inhibited NF- « B competition in PLB-985 extracts ( Fig .
8 A , lanes 3 and 5 ) , whereas mutation of the AA dinucleotide to CG partially inhibited > 60 % of the NF- « B binding ( Fig .
8 A , lane 6 ) .
With extracts from PLB-IIIB cells , only the homologous P2 oligonucleotide competed effectively for complex A ( Fig .
8 A , lane 10 ) .
Mutation of either the 5° guanine residues or the AA dinucleotide of the NF-KB site blocked competition ( Fig .
8 A , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
These results suggest that complex A is composed of NF-KB related proteins that require the entire P2 site for efficient DNA binding .
The proteins involved in protein-DNA complex formation were evaluated by in situ UV crosslinking analysis using BUdR-substituted P2 and HIV enhancer probes together with extracts from the TNF-treated PLB-985 or PLB-IIIB cells ( Fig .
9 ) .
The regions of the mobility shift assay corresponding to NF- « B and complex A were cut from the gel ( Fig .
9 A ) , crosslinked in situ for 30 min and resolved on an SDS polyacrylamide gel ( Fig .
9 B ) .
Both P2 and HIV probes bound proteins of 50 , 40 , and 20 kD from PLB-985 cell extracts ( Fig .
9 B , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
In addition , proteins of 75 and 60 kD interacted weakly with the HIV enhancer .
Differences in protein migration were attributable to the size difference between the two probes .
It is striking that the HIV probe did not efficiently bind proteins from the PLB-IIIB extracts ( Fig .
9 B , lane 4 ) , whereas multiple proteins ranging in size from 50-105 kD were detected using the P2 probe ( Fig .
9 B , lane 3 ) .
Three prominent proteins of 100 , 90 , and 70 kD were identified , as well as several other proteins .
Comparison of uninduced and TNF induced extracts by UV crosslinking also demonstrated that only the 70-kD protein was inducible by TNF ( data not shown ) .
Overall , the profiles of NF- « B DNA binding proteins in PLB-985 and PLB-IIHIB cells differ dramatically , indicating that the nature of NF- « B-like interactions is altered in the HIV-infected cells .
Transcription of IFN- and IFN- Genes .
To examine if changes in the state of differentiation or NF- « B-related activities affected gene expression , the transcription of IFN- « and IFN- ( genes was investigated in PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells ( Fig .
10 ) .
In PLB-985 cells , IFN- RNA was induced by Sendai virus infection 6 h after infection .
In PLB-IIIB cells , a low level of constitutive IFN-G mRNA was detected and coinfection by Sendai virus resulted in three- to fourfold more IFN- @ RNA than similarly induced PLB-985 cells .
In contrast to these results , IFN-ax transcription was only weakly induced in PLB-985 cells , but 50-fold higher levels of IFN-RNA were detected in PLB-IIIB cells .

The arrows indicate the positions of the correct RNA signal .
indicate that HIV infection of myelomonoblastic cells results in selection of a cell population with a more monocytic phenotype by several criteria , changes in NF- « B~like protein-DNA interactions and modulation of cytokine gene expression .
Discussion HIV-1 infection of PLB-985 blast cells resulted in the generation of a chronically infected cell population ( PLB-IIIB ) possessing morphological , immunological , histochemical , and molecular characteristics of monocytes .
Concomitant with HIV infection and myeloid differentiation , dramatic alterations in the protein-DNA interactions occurring at the NF- « B recognition sequence 5-GGGAAATTCC-3 ' were ob-served .
Distinct proteins of 100 , 90 , and 70 kD were identified in PLB-IHIB cells that possessed a higher affinity for the more symmetric PRDII binding site than for the HIV enhancer sites .
These two sequences differ only by the -AA- and -CT dinucleotides in the middle of the binding site , resulting in a more palindromic recognition sequence .
NF-KB represents a family of rel-related DNA binding poly-peptides that include p45 , p50 , p55 , p65 , p75 , and p85 ( c-rel ) .
The activities of these proteins are controlled at several regulatory levels .
Multiple DNA binding NF-KB heterodi-mers with distinct affinities for DNA can form in vitro ( 22 , 42 , L. Cohen and J. Hiscott , manuscript submitted for pub-lication } , single base changes in the NF-KB site can significantly alter the binding affinity of these heterodimers .

These observations indicate that variations in DNA affinity , heterodimer forma-tion , and induction kinetics may contribute to both positive and negative transcriptional control .

A 125-fold molar excess of P2 oligonucleotide or HIV enhancer oligonucleotide was added to the reaction , and at 2-min intervals the amount of complex A remaining was measured .
The relative intensity of the bands at different times was quantified by laser densitometry and plotted as a function of the amount of complex at To .

Several possibilities may account for the dramatic differences in DNA binding activity between PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells .
The induction of distinct or NF- « B-related proteins in PLB-IIIB cells may occur as a result of monocytic differentiation .
Recent studies indicate that c-re/ may be tran-scriptionally induced in PLB-IIIB cells ( data not shown ) .
Altered stoichiometry of NF- « B subunits because of changes in precursor processing may result in binding of larger , incompletely processed subunits .
The 100- and 105-kD p50 precursors may not be processed efficiently in PLB-IIIB cells , resulting in the formation of new combinations of DNA-binding heterodimers , possibly via interactions of the ankyrin repeat .
Overexpression of chromatin-associated proteins may stabilize the binding of proteins that would otherwise possess an affinity too low to be detected by mobility shift analysis .
Recently a protein capable of interacting with the PRDII site but not other NF-KB sites has been described that may act as such an accessory protein and , in part , explain the unique pattern of NF- « B binding observed only in the PLB-IIIB cells ( 47 ) .
The HMG I/Y proteins are chromatin-associated proteins that bind in the minor groove of DNA to sequences that are A'T rich or that possess Oct-1 like recognition sites 10 11 12 ' ' `` ' Uww W `` 7 , tJ , A & & “ o , 02° !

Increased HMG I/Y protein levels have been detected in undifferentiated , rapidly growing and transformed cells ( 50 , 51 ) .
HIV-1 infection may be sufficient to increase HMG I/Y levels in PLB-IIIB cells .
In parental PLB-985 cells , PMA treatment resulted in the induction of NF-KB binding activity and monocytic differentiation .
These results are in agreement with previous studies that showed that NF- « B binding activity , expression of an HIV-LTR reporter gene , and monocytic differentiation were coordinately inducible in immature myeloid cells ( HL-60 and U937 ) .
In the more mature P388 , THP-1 , and P45-1.8 cells , and in primary macrophages , binding activity and basal level expression of the HIV-LTR reporter gene were constitutive and not further inducible , suggesting that NF-KB binding activity is induced during the promyelocytic to monocytic transition ( 39 ) .

Total RNA was isolated from PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells after Sendai virus induction for 6 h. Reverse transcription and PCR-mediated amplification was carried out using 1 ug of RNA and P-labeled IFN- and IFN- consensus primers ( 12 ) .
The products of amplification were resolved by denaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
The relative RNA levels were quantified by laser densitometry of autoradiographs and presented as a bar graph .
activity was not induced by HIV infection of U937 cells .
It is interesting that these experiments identified but did not further characterize a virus induced , slowly migrating protein-DNA complex associated with the HIV enhancer ( 40 ) .
In primary monocytes , both NF- « B and slowly migrating complexes were induced in response to HIV infection ( 40 ) .
The PLB cell line represents a relevant new myeloid model to investigate the relationship between HIV infection , monocytic differentiation , and the induction of these novel NF-KB related activities .
It will nonetheless be important to evaluate the results obtained with the cell model in light of findings with primary monocytic cells .
Given the abundant regulatory levels of NF- « B activity , it appears that whether developmentally regulated or induced by HIV infection , NF- « B provides a range of potent signals for stimulation of HIV gene expression and cytokine activation .
