These p58* T cells were found to express a memory phenotype and corresponded to clonal TCRBV3 T-cell expansion .
Functionally , p58* CTLs displayed a low lytic activity for HLA-A2 tumor and normal cells .
However , this lytic activity was significantly increased after blockade of p58 with specific monoclonal antibodies .
Interestingly , we demonstrated that stimulation by tumor cells was required to trigger the inhibitory effect of p58 on the lytic activity of antigen-specific CTLs and that stimulation of the inhibitory function of p58 by tumor cells correlated with an inhibition of nuclear activation in p58* tumor-specific CTLs .
Introduction RCC , like melanoma , is considered to be a potentially immunogeneic tumor .
In this context , durable tumoral responses were obtained after IL-2 treatment in 15-20 % of metastatic patients , some of them resulting from elicitation of T-cell responses ( 1 ) .
However , despite the presence of a large CD3 infiltrate , it is difficult to generate stable tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells from RCC 's , and the rare specific CTLs described in this model displayed functional alterations that resulted in marginal lytic potential as well as low proliferation efficiency ( 2 ) .
In an attempt to understand the alteration of in sits amplified T-cell proliferative and cytotoxic responses in vifro , we showed previously that expression of inhibitory NK-Rs may contribute to the local immune suppression detected in RCC ( 3 ) .
The identification of the NK-R family specific for HLA-I molecules and the characterization of these related inhibitory ( KIR ) and activatory ( KAR ) receptors allowed a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating target cell recognition as well as NK and T-cell activation ( 4 ) .
KIRs have also been detected on peripheral T lymphocytes from healthy donors with a selective expression on minor T-cell subsets , mostly of the CD8 * , CD28~ , CD4SRO* memory phenotype ( 5 ) .
It is established that KIR engagement also leads to inhibition of T-cell functions including TCR-mediated cytolytic activity and lymphokine production ( 6 , 7 ) .
We previously saw evidence for the expression of particular KIRs ( p58 receptors specific for HLA-C molecules ) by Received 1/21/01 ; accepted 2/21/01 .

significant subsets of TILs in most RCCs .
Among the tumors studied , we have characterized these particular KIR * T cells as tumor-specific T cells , the activity of which is inhibited by the NK-R ( 3 ) .
In the present study , we identified a subpopulation of p58 * T cells detectable at the tumor site and that corresponded to potentially autoreactive T cells .
Interestingly , we further show here that stimulation by tumor cells is a prerequisite for the functional inhibitory effect of the KIR .
Tumor cells presumably induce the recruitment of KIR * T cells reactive to self antigens at the tumor site and control their lytic activity by regulating the KIR inhibitory function as well .
The present studies point to a particular regulation of the KIR functionality expressed on antigen-specific p58 * T cells by autologous renal carcinoma tumor cells and reveal a new mechanism of tumor escape to the host T cell-specific immune response .
Materials and Methods Establishment and Culture of Tumor Cell Lines .
The autologous tumor cell lines were derived from the primary tumor as described previously ( 8 ) .
Briefly , total cell suspensions were centrifuged onto Ficoll Hypaque to eliminate dead cells , and viable cells were cultured in specific culture medium to amplify tumor cells and TILs .
For tumor cells , DMEM/HAM F-12 supplemented with 1 % glutamine , 10 % FCS , and 2 % Ultroser G ( Life Technologies , Inc. , Paisley , Scotland ) was used as complete medium .
A permanent tumor cell line was derived from patient VM that was genotyped as HLA-A2 , A26 , BO4 , B44 , CwO05 , Cw ~ .
Confluent culture dishes were treated by EDTA/trypsin , and cells were subcultured .
Immunofluorescence Analysis .
The phenotypes of TILs and PBLs were analyzed by indirect two-color fluorescence .
Cells ( 2 X 10° ) were first incubated for 30 min at 4°C with conjugated mAbs : EB6-PE ( anti-p58.1 , IgG1 ) , GL183-PE ( anti-p58.2 , IgG1 ) , CH92-PE ( anti-BV3TCR , IgM ) , CD3-FITC , CD56-PECy5 , and CD8-FITC purchased from Immunotech ( Marseille , France ) .
Analysis was performed on 5000 gated TILs ( appearing in forward scatter/side scatter as small lymphocytes comparable with PBLs ) after exclusion of dead cells and debris .
Background levels were measured using isotypic controls .
Analysis was done on a FACS-Sort ( Becton Dickinson , Pont de Claix , France ) using Cell Quest software ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Compensation was set up with single stained samples .
Derivation of p58* , p58~ T-Cell Lines and CTLs .
TILs were stimulated for 2 weeks in MLTC in the presence of 30 units/ml IL-2 before positive selection of p58 * T cells using anti-p58.2 mAb ( GL183 ) and immunomagnetic beads ( Dynal , Campiégne , France ) .
After immunoselection , p58* and p58~ T-cell subsets were expanded ( 3 X 10° cells/well ) on irradiated allogeneic feeder cells ( 7 X 10* peripheral blood mononuclear cells + 3 X 10+ `` LAZ 509 cells/well ) and of irradiated autologous tumor cells ( 2 X 10° cells/well ) .
The p58* T-cell line was cloned by limiting dilution 0.3-1 cell/well using the above feeder cell conditions .
For regulation of KIR function , CTLs were cultured on irradiated LAZ509 cells ( HLA-A2 , Cw6 , Cw12 ) alone ( 3 X 10* cells/well ) or in presence of 3 X 10° tumor cells/well for 6-8 days .
Assay for Cytolytic Activity .
The cytolytic activity of T-cell lines and clones was measured in a 4-h °'Cr release assay , against autologous PHA blasts , autologous tumor cells ( VM ) , allogeneic tumor cell lines ( LR , DM , GE , Caje , and CS ) , and EBV-transformed B cells ( LAZ509 and LCL GE ) as 3240 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

SPECIFIC T-CELL RESPONSE IN RENAL TUMORS described previously ( 8 ) .
In some experiments , mAbs 11PB6 and EB6 ( anti-p58.1 ) , GL183 ( anti-p58.2 ) , B1.23.2 ( anti-HLA-B/C , IgG2a ) , Z27 ( anti-p70 , IgG1 ) , and UCHT1 ( anti-CD3 , IgG1 ) were added at predefined saturating concentrations at the onset of the cytolytic assay .
Data are expressed as the percentage of specific lysis at the indicated E : T cell ratio .
The cytolytic activity of T-cell lines was also assessed in a CD3-redirected lysis assay using P815 mastocytoma mouse cells .
Briefly , *'Cr-labeled P815 ( 3 X 10° ) cells coated with anti-CD3e ( 1-100 ng/ml ) were incubated with serial dilutions of T cells ( E : T ratio ranging from 10:1 to 2:1 ) .
CD3-redirected lysis of labeled P815 cells was modulated by the presence of the anti-KIR mAbs ( 4 ug/well ) .
Results obtained in independent experiments were statistically analyzed using the Fisher test .
TCRBV Gene Segment Usage and Sequencing of TCR Expressed by CTLs .
TCRBV gene segment usage was determined using a semiquantitative PCR analysis as described previously ( 9 ) .
Briefly , total RNA was extracted from T-cell lines ( 5 X 10° cells ) , using a modified guanidinium thiocyanate phenol/chloroform method ( Trizol ; Eurobio , Les Ulis , France ) .
Amplification of cDNA was performed over 30 cycles with the 5 ' sense primers specific for the 24 TCRBV subfamilies and one 3 ' antisense TCRBC-specific primer , and amplimers were detected after electrophoresis on agarose gel .
TCRBV3-BC PCR products derived from pS8* CTLs were purified using the Qiagene columns ( Qiaquick PCR purification kit ; Hilden , Germany ) and sequenced using ABI Prism Big Dye sequencing Ready Reactions kits before electrophoresis on an ABI sequencer ( Applied Biosystem , Foster City , CA ) .
Confocal Microscopy Analysis .
Transcription factor NF-kB was detected using 1 ug/ml of the rabbit polyclonal purified IgG anti-NF-B p65 for 30 min at 4°C ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 GAR ( Molecular Probes ) .
Nuclei were stained using propidium iodide ( red staining ) .
Stained cells were washed with PBS , cytocentrifuged in a cytospin 3 ( Shandon , Pittsburg , PA ) , and analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS Confocal System ( Wetzler , Germany ) .
Results Clonal p58* T Cells Expressing a Unique TCR Are Detected at the Tumor Site and Successfully Expanded in Vitro in MLTC .
Analysis of TILs and PBLs from RCC patients was performed by double color immunofluorescence using conjugated anti-p58 and CD3 mAbs to measure expression of p58 on NK and T cells .
From dissociated tumor , p58 * T cells represented 9 % of the CD3¢* T cells , whereas CD56 */CD3~ NK cells constituted 9 % of the TIL population , and 2.5 % were p58~* ( Fig .
14 ) .
NK receptor p58 was expressed by 5 % of the CD3 * T cells derived from PBLs ( Fig .
1A ) .
Among the 7 % of blood CD56 NK cells , 2 % coexpressed a p58 receptor .
After stimulation by tumor cells in MLTC in the presence of low doses of IL-2 , TILs proliferated ( two to four times ) mainly from the CD8 subset , and the percentage of p58 ~* cells was maintained reaching 10 % of the CD3 * T cells ( Fig .
14 ) .
In contrast , PBLs stimulated by autologous tumor cells did not proliferate and remained in a non-activated state with a significant loss of CD56 expression and a subsequent decrease in p58 */CD3+* T-cell subset ( Fig .
1A ) .
To further characterize p58 */CD3 * T cells amplified during MLTC from TILs , p58 * cells were immunoselected and expanded in vitro .
As described previously , these cells express CD56 and CD45RO but not CD28 .
In addition , p58 * T cells displayed a very restricted TCR repertoire expressing only TCRBV3 ( Fig .
1B ) .
Using specific mAbs , double color immunofluorescence analysis was performed to visualize antigen-specific p58 * T cells in sifu .
In tumor , TCRBV3* p58* T cells corresponded to 1 % of the mononuclear gated cells but were not detected in PBLs ( Fig .
1C ) .
Analysis by reverse transcription-PCR of TCR repertoire using a panel of 24 BV-specific primers confirmed the presence of unique BV3 transcripts in p58 * T cells , whereas the p58~ T-cell line displayed a polyclonal TCR repertoire ( data not shown ) .

p58 Receptor Inhibits the CD3-mediated Lysis of CTL Clones .
To investigate whether the p58 receptor interferes with the lytic activity of CTL clones , blocking experiments with specific mAbs were per-formed .
As depicted in Fig .
24 , after immunoselection , both p58 * and p58 - T-cell subsets were found to display low levels of cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells .
However , when anti-HLA-BC ( not recognizing HLA-A molecules ) or anti-p58 mAbs were added during the effector phase , a dramatic increase in the lysis of tumor cells by p58 * T cells but not by p58 ~ T cells was observed .
Using limiting dilution , from the selected p58 * T-cell line , we derived 12 proliferative T-cell clones displaying a similar lytic potential .
They all expressed TCRBV3 chain , p58.1+* and p58.2* receptors .
Sequencing of TCRBV3 chain in three TCRBV3 CTL clones revealed an identical TCRBV3/BJ 1.2 rearrange-ment , indicating that they derived from the same clone , and CTL 2H7 was further used as a representative clone .
Although both p58.1 and pS58.2 receptors were expressed by p58 CTLs , tumor cells ( HLA-CwO05 , Cw- ) were found to only express the HLA-Cw4 supertype , the ligand for p58.1 receptor .
Accordingly , the lytic activity of CTL 2H7 against autologous tumor cells was inhibited by anti-p58.1 or anti HLA-B/C mAbs added during the effector phase ( Fig .
2B ) .
The functionality of p58 receptors was also assessed by CD3-redirected lysis of P815 murine cells .
These assays revealed that p58 CTLs displayed a high lytic potential because limited quantities of anti-CD3 immunoglobulin ( 1-10 ng/m ! )
were able to activate the lytic machinery .

2C ) .
It is noteworthy that these tests were performed using serial concentrations of anti-CD3 mAb to obtain optimal triggering of CD3 , which could be modulated by the KIR receptor .
This also indicates that the outcome of the lysis results most likely from the existence of a balance between positive ( CD3 ) and negative ( KIR ) signals .
p58* T Cells Kill Both Normal Autologous Tumor Cells and HLA-A2+* Allogeneic Tumor Targets .
The lytic activity of CTL 2H7 was assessed against different normal and tumor cell lines by cytotoxicity assays performed in presence of mAbs to block p58 receptor .
Data shown in Table 1 indicate that CTL 2H7 efficiently killed autologous normal PHA blasts and three of four HLA-A2 renal tumor cell lines , whereas one HLA-A2~ was not recognized .
It also induced the lysis of HLA-A2 * B-cell lines and one T lymphoma with high efficiency .
Differences in lysis of HLA-A2* tumor cells may reflect their different expression levels of HLA-A2 and HLA-C alleles that control , respectively , the positive and negative signals .
These results suggest that CTL 2H7 recognizes a ubiquitous antigen , probably presented by the HLA-A2 molecule , and most likely corresponds to an autoreactive T-cell clone functionally regulated by a powerful p58 inhibitory receptor .
Tumor Cells Trigger p58 Inhibitory Function and Inhibit NF-KB Activation in Tumor-specific CTLs .
To better understand the local in vivo expansion of these particular CD3 */p58* T cells , we analyzed the effect of tumor cells on the activation of p58 * antigen-specific CTLs .
We showed that stimulation of CTL 2H7 with irradiated stimulating LAZ509 cells ( efficiently recognized by CTL 2H7 ) alone does not interfere with the lytic activity of this clone in the presence or in the absence of anti-p58.1 or anti-BC mAbs .
Interestingly , the addition of tumor cells ( 1 of 10 ) to LAZ509 turned on the inhibitory function of KIR and resulted in an abrogation of the basal lytic activity of CTL 2H7 ( Fig .
3A ) .
In five independent CD3-redirected lysis experiments , anti-p58.1 mAb did not significantly affect the lysis of CD3-coated P815 cells by LAZ509-stimulated CTLs ( P > 0.05 ) , whereas it significantly decreased their lysis by CTLs stimulated in the presence of tumor cells ( P = 0.0042 ) as assessed by Fisher test ( Fig .
3B ) .
It should also be noted that phenotypic analysis of CTLs stimulated under 15/71 7M C CD3-redirected lysis 60 cos ignii p58.1 50 & CD3+anti p58.1 HLA-BC p58.2 MCD3+anti p70 these distinct conditions was similar with respect to the expression of p58 receptors ( similar mean fluorescence intensity ) , suggesting that the effect of the tumor cells does not involve p58 receptor expression but rather its function .
Because it has been suggested that the alteration of TIL function in RCC correlated with the inhibition of NF-kB activation ( 10 ) , we therefore asked whether under our experimental condition , a correlation exists between KIR inhibitory function and NF-KB activation .
Interestingly , we observed a dramatic decrease of NF-KB in CTLs after stimulation in the presence of tumor cells that paralleled the inhibitory function of the p58 receptor .
Using confocal microscopy , we show the nuclear localization of NF-kB p65 , detected by a yellow nuclear staining in most CTLs stimulated by LAZ509 only , whereas CTLs stimulated by tumor cells exhibited a green cytoplasmic and a red nuclear staining , indicating the absence of nuclear translocation ( Fig .
3C ) .
In addition , cytotoxicity assays indicate that CTLs cultured in both conditions display similar levels of CD3-redirected lysis of P815 in the absence of p58 triggering ( Fig .
3B ) .
Thus , tumor cell stimulation of p58 ~ CTLs induced a sustained p58-mediated inhibition of the lytic potential , and inactivation of NF-kB may constitute one possible mechanism to explain this observation .

Modulation of the KIR functionality expressed by CTL 2H7 upon stimulation by tumor cells .
CTL 2H7 was stimulated for 6 days in the presence of LAZ 509 ( LAZ ) or LAZS509 and autologous tumor cells ( 10:1 ; LAZ+TUM ) in the presence of 100 units/ml IL-2 ( one representative experiment of five ) .

Discussion Inhibitory NK receptors , first described on NK cells , have also been demonstrated on T cells .
In normal individuals , small subsets of CD3 * KIR * cells expressing a memory phenotype and an oligoclonal TCR repertoire are detected in the peripheral blood .
These cells may be activated in response to chronically expressed antigens ( 11 ) , possibly involved in the maintenance of tolerance or prevention of autoimmunity .
In the case of an immune response against tumor , overexpression of self antigens may induce the activation and expansion of these particular T cells at the tumor site ( 12 ) .
A p58* CTL that recognized a normal tissue-specific antigen was derived from the blood of a metastatic melanoma patient in response to tumor cells that had lost expression of a complete HLA haplotype ( 13 ) .
In RCC , we previously saw evidence for the presence of CD3 ¢ pS8* T cells infiltrating most renal tumors and demonstrated that CTL activity was inhibited by p58 receptors , although there was no major alteration of HLA-I molecule expression by the tumor cells ( 3 ) .
The present study suggests the presence of autoreactive T cells expressing an inhibitory p58 receptor infiltrating a renal tumor .
These T cells display a memory phenotype CD45RO * , CD28 ~ , CD56 * , and correspond to clonal T cells .
These cells were visualized by double color immunolabeling using anti-BV3 and anti-p58 mAbs in the uncultured TILs , where they represented 1 % of CD3 * T cells but were not detected in peripheral T cells .
This particular pS8* T-cell subset , specifically expanded from TILs in vitro , corresponds to the main tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell population because p58~ T cells mainly mediated HLA-unrestricted lysis .
Thus , it may be hypothesized that the antigen presentation by tumor cells and tumor environment may play a role in the local in vivo expansion of the pS8~ T cells , whereas in peripheral blood , these tumor-specific p58~* CTLs are efficiently regulated and not committed to proliferate .
Few , disparate data are yet available concerning the regulation of KIR expression and function on T cells , mainly because of the heterogeneity of the models studied , although recent studies demonstrated that some T cells acquire NK marker expression after activation ( 14 , 15 ) .
Furthermore , it has been shown recently that TCR triggering restored the expression and function of KIR by human T cells ( 16 ) .
In our model , antigen presentation by renal tumor cells does influence the fate of the KIR function but not its membrane expression on the antigen-specific T cells .
Our data point out that p58 receptor expression does not necessarily correlate with anergic T cells but rather modulate T-cell signaling .
In this regard , recently it has been reported that Ly49A receptors , the main inhibitory receptors on murine cells , enhance the amounts of activating signals required for effector cell responses and that inhibition of Ly49A may be overcome by increasing peptide concentration ( 17 ) .
Although much data have focused on the ability of NK cell inhibitory receptors to alter T-cell activation and cytotoxicity , recent studies using KIR transgenic mouse models proposed that NK-R expression by CTLs may also represent a checkpoint in T-cell activation after antigen stimulation ( 18 , 19 ) .
These cells expressing KIR may present a selective advantage to avoid complete exhaustion by over-stimulation and thus may correspond to the memory cell pool .
Our data are consistent with both of these non-mutually exclusive hypotheses because although we demonstrated a significant inhibition of the lytic potential of CTLs by KIR in vitro , this receptor may play a role in the control of the proliferation or the survival of the corresponding T cells in vivo .
Interestingly , the sustained inhibitory function ( KIR on ) of pS58~* T cells in the presence of tumor cells was correlated with an inhibition of NF-KB activation .
An altered activation of the transcription factor NF-kB in TILs and PBLs from RCC patients , responsible for the functional alterations of these effectors ( 20-22 ) , was proposed as a general mechanism of immune suppression in these tumors .
In addition , shedding of gangliosides from RCC cell lines and extracts able to block NF-KB nuclear translocation was described recently ( 23 ) .
In the present study , NF-KB inactivation by renal tumor cells , probably independent of TCR stimulation , is induced in antigen-specific CTLs .
Confocal analysis revealed a similar expression of granzyme B and perforin in the two KIR on/KIR off CTL subsets ( data not shown ) , in accordance with the results of CD3-redirected lysis .
This suggests that NF-kB may be involved in the control of the lytic potential of CTLs by a mechanism independent of these two cytotoxic gene transcrip-tions .
A growing number of genes have been demonstrated to be induced by including cell adhesion molecules , cytokines , and growth factors ( 10 ) .
Whether inhibition of NF-KB activation interferes with some structures involved with the cytotoxic effector phase in our model has to be investigated .
Alternatively , it is known that KIR triggering induces the recruitment of protein tyrosine phosphatases , such as SHP-1 ( 24 ) , that may interfere with several kinases required 3243 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

SPECIFIC T-CELL RESPONSE IN RENAL TUMORS for the phosphorylation of IxBa and thus blocks NF-KB activation .
It would be of interest to explore the possible antagonism between SHP-1 and kinases involved in the control of phosphorylation .
It is also essential to elucidate the relationship between inhibition of NF-kB and impairment of T-cell responses in KIR* T cells to get more insights in the understanding of the function of NK-R in vivo .
