Transcription Factor GATA-3 Is Differentially Expressed in Murine Thl1 and Th2 Cells and Controls Th2-specific Expression of the Interleukin-5 Gene* ( Received for publication , May 2 , 1997 , and in revised form , June 5 , 1997 ) Dong-Hong Zhang } , Lauren Cohn # § , Prabir Rayt # , Kim Bottomly§1 , and Anuradha Rayt| From the { Department of Internal Medicine , Pulmonary and Critical Care Section , the §Section of Immunobiology , and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , Connecticut 06520 Interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) , which is produced by CD4* T helper 2 ( Th2 ) cells , but not by Th1 cells , plays a key role in the development of eosinophilia in asthma .
Despite increasing evidence that the outcome of many diseases is determined by the ratio of the two subsets of CD4* T helper cells , Th1 and Th2 , the molecular basis for Th1- and Th2-specific gene expression remains to be elucidated .
We previously established a critical role for the transcription factor GATA-3 in IL-5 promoter activation in EL-4 cells , which express both Thl- and Th2-type cytokines .
Our studies reported here demonstrate that GATA-3 is critical for expression of the IL-5 gene in bona fide Th2 cells .
Whereas mutations in the GATA-3 site abolished antigen-or cAMP -stimulated IL-5 promoter activation in Th2 cells , ectopic expression of GATA-3 in Thl cells or in a non-lymphoid , non-IL-5-producing cell line activated the IL-5 promoter .
During the differentiation of naive CD4* T cells isolated from T cell receptor transgenic mice , GATA-3 gene expression was up-regulated in developing Th2 cells , but was down-regulated in Thl cells , and antigen- or cAMP -activated Th2 cells ( but not Thl cells ) expressed the GATA-3 protein .
Thus , GATA-3 may play an important role in the balance between Thl and Th2 subsets in immune responses .
Inhibition of GATA-3 activity has therapeutic potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic diseases .
Activated CD4* T cells are subdivided into two subsets , T helper 1 ( Th1 ) and Th2 , based on their biological functions , which , in turn , depend on the cytokines they produce ( 1-4 ) .
Th1 cells produce interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) `` and interferon-y ( IFN-y ) and stimulate microbicidal activity in macrophages and promote cell-mediated immunity ( 1-4 ) .
Th2 cells , on the other hand , produce IL-4 and IL-5 , which stimulate IgF production and eosinophilic inflammation , respectively ( 1-4 ) .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org good evidence that in atopic asthmatics , a Th2-type response occurs in the airways ( 5-8 ) .
Although it appears that the outcome of many diseases such as asthma is determined by the ratio of Th1l to Th2 cells ( 4 ) , the molecular basis for Th1- and Th2-specific gene expression remains to be elucidated .
Asthma is a chronic obstructive disease of the small airways .
Evolving evidence indicates that asthma is the result of an inflammatory process interacting with a susceptible airway best defined at present as airway hyperresponsiveness ( 9 ) .
In asthma , the most striking and consistent pathophysiology is damage to the bronchial epithelium caused by cytotoxic cati-onic proteins released by infiltrating eosinophils ( 10 , 11 ) .
Various lines of evidence indicate that secreted products of activated T cells , such as the cytokine IL-5 , play a central role in orchestrating the unique inflammatory response seen in asthma .
Since it was isolated and cloned in the mid-1980s , the intimate relationship between IL-5 , eosinophils , and asthma has been extensively documented ( 12 ) .
IL-5 has multiple effects on the biology of eosinophils not limited to differentiation , proliferation , recruitment , and activation ( 12 ) .
Increasing evidence places IL-5 in a key role in the development of eosinophilia in asthma ( 5 , 6 ) .
IL-5 mRNA was significantly enhanced in bronchoalveolar lavage cells obtained from asthmatics challenged with ragweed antigen ( 8 ) .
Again , peripheral blood T cells from asthmatics were found to secrete IL-5 in response to the common house dust mite ( Dermatopha-goides farinae ) antigen ( 13 ) .
Most striking , in ovalbumin-sen-sitized guinea pigs and mice , monoclonal antibody to IL-5 decreased pulmonary eosinophilia and prevented the development of airway hyperresponsiveness ( 14 , 15 ) .
Also , in a mouse model of asthma , IL-5-deficient mice were found to lack eosinophilia , lung pathology ( 16 , 17 ) , and airway hyperresponsiveness upon allergen challenge ( 16 ) .
In both humans and mice , the production of IL-5 is restricted to a few cell types , which include T cells ( 7 ) , mast cells ( 18 ) , and eosinophils ( 19 ) , the predominant source being T cells of the Th2-type ( 7 ) .
In general , IL-5 is not produced constitutively by Th2 cells .
IL-5 gene expression has been shown to be stimulated by antigen , mitogens ( concanavalin A ) , eicosanoid compounds ( leukotriene B , and prostaglandins ) , and cytokines ( 20 , 21 ) .
Intracellular cAMP -increasing agents , such as IL-1 @ , pros-taglandin E ; , and the cAMP analogue dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( Bt ; cAMP ) , have been shown to differentially regulate cytokine production by Th1 and Th2 cells .
Whereas the production of the Thl response-inducing cytokine IL-12 and that of the Thl cytokines IL-2 and IFN-y are inhibited by cAMP-increasing agents , the production of IL-5 is strongly induced by the same agents , suggesting a possible immunoregulatory role for this second messenger ( 21-24 ) .
The molecular mechanisms underlying Th2 cell-specific IL-5 gene expression are unclear .
In our previous studies of IL-5 21597 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 21598 promoter activation by cAMP in the murine cell line EL-4 , which expresses both Th2- and Th1-type cytokines , we showed that deletion of the IL-5 promoter to -66 , which disrupted a GATA site located between -70 and -60 , abolished activation of the promoter ( 25 ) .
Furthermore , in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) , we demonstrated that the transcription factor GATA-3 , but not GATA-4 , binds to this GATA site ( 25 ) .
This was the first description of the involvement of GATA-3 in the transcription of any cytokine gene ( 25 ) .
Yamagata et al .
( 26 ) , in their studies of transcription of the human IL-5 gene in the ATL-16T cell line , also demonstrated the importance of the GATA site in expression of the human IL-5 gene .
However , two important points merit consideration in comparing these two studies .
First , IL-5 gene expression in ATL-16T cells is largely constitutive ( 27 ) . ``
However , in both humans and mice , the IL-5 gene is expressed in an inducible fashion , and therefore , the ATL-16T cells do not reflect the typical expression characteristics of the IL-5 gene either in humans or in mice .
Second , GATA-4 is predominantly expressed in the heart , intestines , epithelium , and reproductive organs , and its expression is low or undetectable in both human and murine T cells ( 28 , 29 ) .
Therefore , the atypical high level of GATA-4 activity in ATL-16T cells may contribute to the atypical ( constitutive ) nature of IL-5 gene expression in these cells .
In another study , Prieschl et al .
( 30 ) showed that the GATA site located between -70 and -60 in the IL-5 promoter is also important for IL-5 gene expression in mast cells .
In our previous study , we additionally demonstrated that activation of the IL-5 promoter also requires an intact AP-1 site within the CLEO element ( consensus lym-phokine element 0 ) located between -53 and -39 in the pro-moter ; mutation of this site in the context of an ~550-bp promoter totally abrogated promoter activity .
In this report , we show that the transcription factor GATA-3 is crucial for IL-5 gene expression in bona fide Th2 cells and that ectopic expression of GATA-3 alone results in IL-5 promoter activation in a non-IL-5-producing cell line .
We also show that GATA-3 activity is present only in Th2 cells and is undetectable in Th1 cells .
Inhibition of GATA-3 activity may therefore be effective in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic diseases .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Generation and Maintenance of Th1 and Th2 Cells-Both DIO and C19 clones were maintained in Click 's medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 5 units/ml murine recombinant IL-2 ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , 50 uM B-mercaptoethanol , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 50 ug/ml gentamycin at 37 °C with 5 % CO , ( 81 , 82 ) .

RESULTS We have used the established nontransformed murine T cell clones D10.G4.1 ( Th2 ) ( 31 ) and C19 ( Th1 ) ( 32 ) and Th1 and Th2 cells obtained by differentiation of naive CD4* T cells from DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice to gain insight into mechanisms that permit IL-5 gene expression in Th2 cells but limit its expression in Th1 cells .
The GATA Site in the 5'-Flanking Region of the IL-5 Gene Is Critical for IL-5 Promoter Activation in Th2 Cells-In our previous studies of cAMP-induced IL-5 promoter activation using an ~550-bp promoter fragment and the murine T cell line EL-4 , we had identified two regions in the IL-5 5'-flanking region that were critical for induction of the IL-5 promoter : one was the AP-1-binding site within the CLEO element , whereas the other was a region between -70 and -60 containing two overlapping GATA sites , deletion of which abrogated activation of the promoter ( 25 ) .
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional activation of the IL-5 gene by Ag in Th2 cells , we transfected the murine Th2 clone D10.G4.1 ( 31 ) with a reporter gene ( firefly luciferase ) construct containing a 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog GATA-3 and Th2-specific Transcription A $ 000 2500 + [ J unstimulated BJ PMA+bt , cAMP 2000 4 1500 4 Activity 4000+ R Ag+APC 3000 + Luciferase 2000+ 1000+ mut .

Transcriptional activation of the murine IL-5 promoter in D10 cells requires the GATA-3 and AP-1 sites ( within the CLEO element ) , but not the NF-AT site .
A , rested cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids by electroporation and either left unstimulated or stimulated with Bt , cAMP ( 1 mM ) + PMA ( 25 ng/ml ) .
The wild-type ( w ?
¢ ) promoter contained sequences between approximately -1700 and +24 of the IL-5 promoter , and the individual mutations were made in the context of this fragment .
For antigen stimulation , rested cells were first stimulated with conalbumin and mitomycin C-treated and T cell-depleted APCs in complete medium containing 5 units/ml IL-2 for 72 h and then subjected to electroporation .
After 18-20 h , cells were harvested , and luciferase and B-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously ( 25 ) .
The luciferase activity ( arbitrary units ) for each of the reporter plasmids is shown in the bar graph , with results representing the average of multiple experiments and normalized for B-galactosidase activity .
The deviations were no more than 15 % between experiments .

Both Ag and Bt , cAMP + PMA caused a 10-20-fold activation of the wild-type IL-5 promoter , and mutations in the AP-1 site or the GATA site in the context of the 1.7-kb promoter completely abolished activation of the IL-5 promoter ( Fig .
1A ) .
Mutations in the NF-AT site , on the other hand , had no effect on IL-5 promoter activity .
GATA-3 DNA Binding Activity Is Present in Activated Th2 Cells , but Is Absent in Activated Th1 Cells-We next investigated the binding of nuclear proteins to the GATA element and the CLEO element using nuclear extracts from Th2 ( D10 ) cells .
As shown in Fig .
24 ( lane 1 ) , two complexes were detected using nuclear extracts from unstimulated D10 cells .
The binding intensity of both complexes was augmented upon stimulation of the cells with Bt , cAMP + PMA ( Zane 2 ) .
Although both complexes were competed for by an excess of the unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide , competition for complex I formation was incomplete even with a 100-fold molar excess of the unla- 21599 beled competitor , suggesting that complex I binds with a lower affinity to the GATA site than complex II ( Zane 3 ) .
Oligonucleotides containing specific mutations in three different regions of the double GATA site were also used as competitors .
Mutant 1 contained mutations in the distal GATA sequence , and mutant 2 in the proximal sequence , whereas mutant 3 was mutated in both sequences .
None of these mutants was able to compete for formation of the complexes , suggesting the involvement of the entire sequence between -70 and -60 in the formation of the complexes ( Zanes 4-6 ) .
The complexes ( especially complex II ) were supershifted by an anti-GATA-3 antibody ( Ab ) ( Zane 7 ) , but not by an anti-GATA-4 antiserum ( lane 9 ) .
To compare GATA-3 DNA binding activity between Th1 and Th2 cells , we performed a similar analysis with nuclear extracts from both D10 and C19 ( Th1 ) cells prepared in the same experiment under identical conditions .
As shown in Fig .
2B ( lower panel ) , nuclear proteins from induced D10 cells generated two complexes that were supershifted by the anti-GATA-3 Ab ( lane 3 ) , but not by the anti-GATA-4 Ab ( Zane 4 ) .
Using identical protein amounts of nuclear extracts prepared from C19 cells , we detected a very low level of binding activity in resting cells ( Fig .
2B , upper panel , lane 1 ) .
Upon treatment of the C19 cells with Bt , cAMP and PMA , whether alone ( data not shown ) or in combination , the intensity of the complexes did not increase , but consistently diminished ( Fig .
2B , upper panel , compare lane 2 with lane 1 ) .
We then tested the same extracts for binding to the AP-1 site within the CLEO element .
As shown in Fig .
2B , used at only half the amounts used in the GATA-3 binding assays , robust inducible binding activity was detected with both D10 and C19 nuclear extracts .
The anti-c-Jun and anti-c-Fos ( reactive to all Fos family proteins ) Abs did not affect the formation of the complex with either extract ( lanes 7 and 10 , respectively ) , whereas the anti-JunB and anti-JunD Abs supershifted/inhib-ited complex formation ( lanes 8 and 9 , respectively ) .
Taken together , these results demonstrated that D10 and C19 cells contain similar levels of AP-1 binding activity .
However , D10 cells constitutively contain some GATA-3 DNA binding activity that is augmented upon stimulation of the cells .
In contrast , unstimulated C19 cells contain very little GATA-3 DNA binding activity that decreases upon stimulation of the cells .
Thl1 and Th2 Cells Obtained by Differentiation of Naive CD4* T Cells Display Differential GATA-3 DNA Binding Ac-tivity-We investigated whether the observed difference in GATA-3 binding activity between the Th1 ( C19 ) and Th2 ( D10 ) clones was also true in Th1 and Th2 cells obtained by differentiation of naive splenic CD4* T cells from DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from the Thl and Th2 cells stimulated with Ag for 8 or 24 h , and GATA and AP-1 binding activities were determined with the extracts .
The Th1 cell extract from both time points generated two complexes with the GATA probe ( Fig .
3A , lanes 1-6 ) , whereas the Th2 extract generated three complexes ( Zanes 7-12 ) .
Complexes I and II were of the same mobility and reactivity to antisera as complexes I and II illustrated in Fig .
2 .
Complex II was not formed with the Thl extract .
A new complex ( III ) , specific for Ag stimulation and of mobility intermediate between complexes I and II , was formed with both Th1 and Th2 extracts .
Complex III was more distinct with the 24-h extracts ( Fig .
3A , left panel , compare lane 4 with lane 1 and lane 10 with lane 7 ) .
Complex III , formed with both the Th1 extracts ( Zanes 3 and 6 ) and the Th2 extracts ( lanes 9 and 12 ) , was inhibited by the anti-GATA-4 antiserum .
However , the anti-GATA-3 Ab did not react with any of the complexes formed with the Th1 extracts ( lanes 2 and 5 ) .
By contrast , in our EMSAs with the Th2 extracts , complex I was slightly inhibited by the anti-GATA-3 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 21600 Fic .

Murine CD4* Th2 cells , but ” II : 4:4 n w not Th1 cells , express GATA-3 DNA I binding activity .

Essentially identical data were obtained in EMSAs with nuclear extracts from Ag-stimulated D10 and C19 cells ( data not shown ) .
We have also explored GATA-3 binding activity in another Th1l-type clone , A.E7 ( 35 ) .
No IL-5 mRNA was detected in Northern blot analyses of RNA prepared from A.E7 cells that were stimulated for 24 h with Ag ( data not shown ) .
Also , nuclear extracts prepared from Ag-induced A.E7 cells had no detectable GATA-3 binding activity ( data not shown ) .
We do not know the exact composition of the different complexes that are formed with Th2 nuclear extracts and the IL-5 GATA site .
Complex II could represent a higher order form ( dimer or tetramer ) of complex I that may contain a monomer or dimer of GATA-3 .
The oligonucleotide competition experiments suggest that complex I binds to the GATA site with a lower affinity 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 mental Procedures . ``
Cultures were maintained for 3 days .
The cells were further stimulated at the end of this period with fresh mitomycin C-treated and T cell-depleted APCs and Ag for 8 or 24 h , and nuclear extracts were prepared .
The extracts were used in EMSAs as described in the legend to Fig .

9 10 11 12 than complex II .
Also , formation of complex II was consistently more sensitive to the anti-GATA-3 antibody than formation of complex I , suggesting that the epitope recognized by the anti-GATA-3 monoclonal antibody in the GATA-3 protein is more accessible in complex II .
Taken together , it appears that activated Th1 cells lack GATA-3 DNA binding activity .
The significance of the reactivity of complex III to the anti-GATA-4 antiserum is unclear at the present time since the expression of GATA-4 has only been described in the heart , intestines , and gonads ( 28 , 29 ) .
We also investigated AP-1 binding activity with the extracts of both cells .
In both cases , a major complex ( Fig .
34 , right panel , shown by an arrow ) and a minor complex were obtained .
Nuclear extracts from Thl cells that were stimulated for 8 h contained less AP-1 binding activity than extracts from similarly treated Th2 cells ( Fig .
34 , right panel , compare lanes 1 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog GATA-3 and Th2-specific Transcription and 7 ) .
However , the AP-1 binding activities of the 24-h extracts from the two cell types were equivalent ( Zanes 2 and 8 ) .
The supershift/inhibition studies again revealed the presence of JunB and JunD in the complexes formed with both Th1l ( lanes 4 and 5 ) and Th2 ( lanes 10 and 11 ) extracts .
The anti-c-Jun Ab also partially inhibited formation of the Thl-specific complex ( Zane 3 ) .
However , since there was residual DNA binding activity in the complexes generated with both Th1l and Th2 extracts that was not abolished by any of these antisera , we can not rule out the possibility that related proteins are also present in the complexes .
The residual binding appears not be due to any binding to the Elf-l-like site within the CLEO element since an oligonucleotide containing a mutation in the EIf-1 site was able to efficiently compete for binding to the CLEO element using nuclear extracts of either clones or cultured cells ( data not shown ) .
To ensure that the lower intensity of the 8-h Th1 complex was not related to technique , we tested the extracts for binding to a probe containing a binding site for CREB .
As illustrated in Fig .
3B , the CREB binding activity was equivalent in the two nuclear extracts , ruling out a general deficiency of proteins in the Th1 cell extracts .
Immunoprecipi-tation experiments performed with cell extracts prepared from metabolically labeled cells have shown that the lack of GATA-3 DNA binding activity in Thl cells is due to the absence of GATA-3 protein in these cells ( data not shown ) .
Collectively , our data indicate that Th2 cells contain GATA-3 protein in a constitutive fashion , which increases upon stimulation of the cells by Ag or cAMP .
In contrast , Th1 cells express very little/no GATA-3 at the basal level , which reproducibly decreases upon stimulation of the cells .
Transactivation of the IL-5 Promoter by Ectopic Expression of GATA-3-We reasoned that if GATA-3 controls tissue-specific expression of IL-5 , then ectopic expression of GATA-3 in non-GATA-3-expressing cells would allow IL-5 gene expression in the cells .
Upon stimulation , neither Th1 clones nor the cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa expresses IL-5 or GATA-3 protein , but do express AP-1 proteins .
To test whether expression of GATA-3 RNA would make these cells permissive for IL-5 promoter activation , Th1 cells ( A.E7 ) ( Fig .
4A ) or Helia cells ( Fig .
4B ) were transfected with the 1.7-kb IL-5 promoter-reporter construct together with a vector for either sense or antisense ( negative control ) GATA-3 RNA expression .
Although it has been difficult to sustain high levels of GATA-3 RNA expression in non-Th2 cells ( especially in Th1 cells ) by transient transfection methods , in both A.E7 cells and HeLa cells , expression of GATA-3 sense RNA , but not antisense RNA , resulted in 4-6-fold activation of the 1.7-kb IL-5 promoter upon stimulation with Bt , cAMP and PMA .
The absence of induction of the promoter without stimulation of the cells suggests the need for binding of inducible proteins to other DNA sites , most likely the AP-1 site within the CLEO element , for the induction of the promoter .
However , stimulation of the cells alone without GATA-3 expression did not activate the IL-5 promoter .
A minimal promoter containing IL-5 DNA sequences between -76 and +24 , which include the GATA site between -70 and -60 and the CLEO element , but no other identifiable transcription factor-binding sites , was also similarly activated by coexpres-sion of the sense ( but not the antisense ) GATA-3 expression vector in both cell types ( data not shown ) .
Also , as shown in Fig .
4B , overexpression of the p65 subunit of NF- « B , a potent trans-activator , failed to up-regulate IL-5 promoter activity in Helia cells , demonstrating the specificity of GATA-3 in this experimental setting .
Thus , although Th1 cells and Hela cells express several transcription factors , the DNA-binding sites for a few of which can be identified in the 1.7-kb IL-5 promoter , these cells can only activate the promoter in the presence of 21601 A a A.E7 Be HeLa s5 4 Aun F ] un induced 5 Winduced 5 g c 2 2 4 , G 3 2 g B 1.5 3 3° o | 2 2 , 0.5 ° s as ° s as - GAiTas - GATAs péS wt IL-5 wt IL-5 Fic .

GATA-3 .
This strongly suggests that GATA-3 serves the role of a tissue-specific regulator of IL-5 gene expression .
Our studies do not rule out the involvement of additional control elements that might be involved in the overall enhancement of transcription of the IL-5 gene in Th2 cells .
Kinetics of GATA-3 RNA Expression during Development of Th1 and Th2 Cells from Naive Spleen Thp Cells-To determine whether the difference in GATA-3 activity between Thl and Th2 cells reflected a preferential up-regulation of GATA-3 gene expression in Th2 cells in the course of primary stimulation , naive spleen Thp cells were allowed to differentiate along a Th1 or Th2 pathway by treatment with Ag and the appropriate cytokines and anti-cytokine antibodies .
Northern blot analysis of GATA-3 mRNA expression was carried out in differentiating cells harvested at different time points after stimulation .
Identification of differentiated cells as predominantly Th1 or Th2 populations was carried out by ELISA for IL-4 , IL-5 , and IFN-y protein in culture supernatants after secondary stimulation with Ag .
As shown in Fig .
5A , naive Thp cells were found to express low levels of GATA-3 mRNA .
In cells differentiated along a Th2 pathway , there was a substantial increase in GATA-3 mRNA at 24 h after stimulation , which continued to increase until 48 h and reached a plateau thereafter .
In contrast , no such induction was seen in Th1 cells , and there was actually a decrease in the level of GATA-3 message at 24 h after stimulation , which reached a minimum at 48 h post-stimula-tion , by which time a commitment of the developing cells along the Th1/Th2 lineage has already occurred ( 36 ) .
The loading of RNA was equivalent for the two sets of cells as evident from hybridization of the same blot with glyceraldehyde-3-phos-phate dehydrogenase ( data not shown ) .
The cells were restimulated after day 5 with fresh T cell-depleted and mitomycin C-treated APCs and Ag for 48 h , and cytokine levels in the culture supernatants were evaluated by ELISA ( Fig .

along the ThZ2 pathway results in a substantial increase in GATA-3 gene expression , whereas that along the Th1l pathway leads to a decrease in GATA-3 gene expression .
DISCUSSION This study establishes a new role for the transcription factor GATA-3 as a determinative factor in Th2-specific IL-5 gene expression .
The DNA sequence of the GATA-3 double site is identical in the human and murine IL-5 genes .
GATA-3 belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors that bind to the WGATAR ( W = A/T ; R = A/G ) DNA sequence through a highly conserved C , zinc finger domain .
Six members ( GATA-1 to GATA-6 ) of this family have been identified in avians , with homologues in mammals and amphibians ( 29 ) .
Based on their expression profile , the GATA proteins may be classified functionally as hemopoietic ( GATA-1 to GATA-3 ) or non-hemopoi-etic ( GATA-4 to GATA-6 ) , and this classification is also valid from structural considerations ( 29 ) .
GATA-3 is expressed primarily in T lymphocytes and in the embryonic brain .
Functionally important GATA-3-binding sites have been identified in T cell receptor genes and the CD8 gene ( 87-41 ) .
However , in the case of most of these genes , a mutation of the GATA site in the context of a large promoter fragment fails to inhibit the activity of the respective promoters , suggesting redundancy in their enhancers ( 42 ) .
Knock out of the GATA-3 gene in mice results in embryonic death on day 12 , with a failure of fetal hemato-poiesis and defects in the central nervous system ( 48 ) .
Recently , GATA-3 was shown to be an essential component in the earliest steps of T cell development in the thymus using antisense oligonucleotides for GATA-3 in fetal thymus organ cultures ( 44 ) and using embryonic stem cells containing homozy-gous mutations in the GATA-3 gene and the RAG-2 gene ( 45 ) .
Collectively , these studies indicate that GATA-3 is not a functionally redundant GATA family protein .
Activation of IL-5 gene expression by both Ag and a combination of Bt , cAMP and PMA requires the GATA site and the AP-1 site , but not the NF-AT site , in the IL-5 promoter , and both stimuli trigger similar binding activities at the corresponding sites .
This suggests that activation of the TCR-CD3 GATA-3 and Th2-specific Transcription complex might involve stimulation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways in the cell .
Indeed , engagement of the TCR-CD3 complex by foreign Ag or by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies has been shown to result in elevation of intracellular cAMP levels in T cells that is associated with the onset of DNA synthesis in the cells ( 46 ) .
Whereas several studies have triggered a heightened appreciation for the role of cAMP as an immunomodulator ( 47 ) , there is a need to identify a molecular basis for the differential effects of cAMP in the regulation of gene expression at specific stages of activation or of differentiation of T cells following stimulation via the TCR-CD3 complex .
Our studies suggest that specific transcription factors such as GATA-3 may play a role in the differential effects of cAMP on immune responses during T cell activation and/or differentiation .
There are two possible explanations for why the IL-5 gene is not expressed in uninduced Th2 cells despite high basal levels of GATA-3 .
First , the activation by GATA-3 requires post-translational modification of the protein ; indeed , we have identified several potential protein kinase A and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites in the GATA-3 protein .
Second , IL-5 promoter activation also requires binding of proteins to the AP-1 site within the CLEO element ( also identical in the murine and human genes ) , which is only achieved once the cells are acti-vated .
Among the AP-1 family of proteins , we have detected only JunB and JunD in the complex that forms with the CLEO element using both Thl and Th2 extracts .
Induction of JunB transcription by cAMP has been previously described ( 48 , 49 ) .
Similar to our findings , in one of these studies ( 45 ) , anti-Jun or anti-Fos antibodies did not completely supershift/inhibit cAMP -induced complexes formed with an AP-1 site .
It is possible that Ag and Bt , cAMP induce the formation of heterodimers of JunB/JunD with an as yet unidentified Jun-re-lated protein , and the resulting complex exhibits a lower affinity for anti-JunB and anti-JunD antibodies .
Alternatively , cAMP induces the formation of heteromeric complexes between .
JunB/JunD and other related bZIP proteins .
Although the AP-1 proteins recognize the TPA response element , which differs from the cAMP response element by only 1 base pair , the distinction between the TPA response element/cAMP response element and AP-1/CREB is , however , not absolute .
TPA response element and cAMP response element-related sequences have now been identified that are recognized by both groups of proteins , and heterodimers between some members of the CREB/ATF family and JunB , JunD , and c-Jun have been reported ( 50 ) .
The complex formed with the AP-1 site in the IL-5 promoter might therefore be composed of heteromeric complexes between JunB/JunD and CREB/ATF proteins .
Recently , the proximal region of the IL-4 promoter was shown to interact with c-Maf , the product of the proto-oncogene c-maf , which is expressed in Th2 cells , but not in Th1 cells ( 51 ) .
The results of multiple studies by different investigators indicate that several transcription factors binding to the promoter proximal region or to regions outside of the 800-bp IL-4 promoter may coordinately regulate overall IL-4 promoter activity , the Th2 specificity being conferred by proteins such as c-Maf and probably also NF-IL-6 , which , like c-Maf , is expressed in Th2 cells , but not in Th1 cells ( 52-54 ) .
The IL-4 promoter also contains a double GATA site between -274 and -264 ( which is very similar to the one in the IL-5 promoter located between -70 and -60 ) and a single GATA motif between -112 and -107 .
It will be interesting to examine the activity of a large promoter fragment of the IL-4 gene containing mutations in the GATA sites and the effect of ectopically expressed GATA-3 on wild-type promoter activity .
At the RNA level , the expression of GATA-3 in Thl cells 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog GATA-3 and Th2-specific Transcription generated by in vitro differentiation of naive CD4* T cells is at one-twentieth to one-thirtieth the level detected in Th2 cells .
In EMSAs , we have consistently detected a very low level of GATA-3 binding activity in the resting Thl clones C19 and A.E7 .
Also , this activity reproducibly decreases upon stimulation of the cells , whether by Ag or by a combination of BtycAMP and PMA .
This decrease in binding activity may result from a higher rate of turnover of GATA-3 RNA in activated Th1 cells as seen in developing Th1 cells during a primary stimulation of naive primary CD4* T cells .
This effect also appears to be specifically targeted at GATA-3 since the same extracts used at half the amounts displayed significant inducible binding activity at the AP-1 site .
Our data suggest that the decrease in GATA-3 levels in stimulated Th1 cells is another mechanism that ensures the specific profile of cytokine production by Th1 and Th2 cells .
Studies of asthma in both human and animal models are consistent with the concept that airway inflammation , a characteristic feature of asthma , requires the presence of activated Th2 cells .
Among the Th2 cytokines , IL-5 is key to the eosinophilia typically associated with the disease , being intimately involved with eosinophil differentiation , proliferation , and sur-vival .
Eosinophilia is also a feature of a number of other pathological conditions such as idiopathic hypereosinophilic syn-drome , parasitic infections , and allergies ( 12 ) .
If asthma results from an abnormal skewing of the immune response in the lung toward the generation of Th2 cells , then understanding the reversal of this process is critical .
One important target for the development of anti-asthma therapeutics is therefore inhibition of IL-5 gene expression in T cells .
GATA-3 is an especially attractive target in this regard since its expression is limited to T cells in the adult , and therefore , any GATA-3-specific antagonist can be expected to have minimum side effects .
Another important question that arises from this study is whether forced expression of GATA-3 in Th1 cells would aid in altering Th1/Th2 ratios .
This is important in controlling Thl-driven pathologies , which include autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus .
In a recent study investigating the role of CD4 * Th1 and Th2 cells in the induction of diabetes mellitus , Th1 cells promoted disease , whereas Th2 cells did not ( 55 ) .
Thus , this study identifies differential expression of the GATA-3 gene in Th1 and Th2 cells and relates it to the production of a cytokine of significant biomedical importance .
This raises intriguing questions about the role of GATA-3 in determining the balance between Th1 and Th2 subsets in immune responses and disease states .
Additionally , identification of GATA-3 as a critical component in IL-5 gene expression raises possibilities for the therapy of asthma and allergic diseases and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome via blockade of GATA-3 activation .
