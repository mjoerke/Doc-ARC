Good , January 21 , 1993 ABSTRACT We have previously reported that the T lymphocytes of a child with severe combined immunodeficiency are defective in the transcription of several lymphokine genes that include IL2 , IL 3 , IL4 , and ILS , which encode interleukins 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ( IL-2 , -3 , -4 , and - 5 ) .
To determine whether the defect in the patient 's T lymphocytes involved a trans-acting factor common to the affected lymphokine genes , we examined the ability of nuclear factors from the patient 's T lymphocytes to bind response elements present in the regulatory region of ZL2 .
Nuclear factor NF-kB , activation protein 1 ( AP-1 ) , OCT-1 , and NF-IL-2B binding activity were normal .
In contrast , the binding of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) to its response element in the ZL2 enhancer and to an NF-AT-like response element present in the ZL4 enhancer was abnormal .
To ascertain whether the abnormal NF-AT binding activity was related to an impaired function , we transfected patient and control T lymphocytes with constructs containing the reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) under the control of the entire ZL2 regulatory region or of multimers of individual enhancer sequences .
CAT expression directed by the ZL2 regulatory region or by a multimer of the NF-AT-binding site was markedly lower in the patient relative to controls .
In contrast , CAT gene expression directed by a multimer of the OCT-1 proximal ( OCT-1p ) -binding site was equivalent in patient and controls .
These results indicate that an abnormality of /or influencing NF-AT may underlie the multiple lymphokine deficiency in this patient .
Induction of lymphokine gene expression is mediated by trans-acting factors that interact with specific DNA elements present in the regulatory region of these genes .
The regulation of interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene ( designated ZL2 ) expression is one of the best characterized among the T cell-specific lymphokine genes .
IL2 transcription requires the binding of common regulatory factors , such as OCT-1 , activation protein 1 ( AP-1 ) , and nuclear factor NF-kB , which are involved in the regulation of the expression of several genes in lymphoid as well as nonlymphoid cells ( reviewed in ref .
1 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
In addition , IL2 expression requires specific regulatory factors like NF-AT , the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( 1 ) .
Expression of NF-AT , like the expression of IZL2 , is T cell-restricted ( 2 ) and tightly linked to T-cell activation ( 3 , 8-10 ) .
In a previous report we described a child with severe combined immunodeficiency with a normal number of circulating T cells and poor T-lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens , which was corrected in vitro and in vivo by recombinant IL-2 ( rIL-2 ) ( 11 ) .
Further studies showed that the patient 's T lymphocytes were defective in the expression of IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , and IL-5 mRNAs as a result of decreased transcription of IL2 , IL 3 , IL4 , and ILS .
The expression by T lymphocytes of other cytokines such as granulocyte/ The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

Transacting factors binding their response elements in the enhancer of The numbers represent the 5 ' position relative to the transcription start site ( 0 ) .
Nuclear factors are NF-AT , OCT-1 , NF-kB , AP-1 , NF-IL-2B ( 1-4 ) , and OCT-1 + OCT-1 associated protein ( OAP ) ( 5 ) .
Recently two more trans-acting factors involved in IL2 regulation have been described .
CD28 stimulation induces expression of a CD28 response complex ( CD28RC ) , which possesses enhancer activity ( 6 ) .
The second one suppresses expression and binds a sequence called 'negative response element A `` `` ( NRE-A ) ( 7 ) .
macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 6 , both of which are not T lymphocyte-restricted , was not affected ( 12 ) .
A defect in a T lymphocyte-specific trans-acting protein required for the transcription of IL2 and other T cell-restricted lymphokine genes could account for impaired lymphokine expression .
To address the question of whether a regulatory factor could be defective in the patient 's T lymphocytes , we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) to examine the binding activities present in nuclear extracts from patient T lymphocytes and specific for response elements ( binding sites ) present in the ZL2 and IL4 enhancer .
We also examined the ability of trans-acting factors /response elements to direct the transcription of a reporter gene , chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase ( CAT ) , in patient and control T lymphocytes .
We demonstrate here that the patient 's T lymphocytes have an abnormality in the binding activity of NF-AT .
This abnormality was determined to be functionally important because it is accompanied by defective NF-AT-enhancer activity .
MATERIALS AND METHODS T-Cell Lines .
T-cell lines were prepared from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the patient or healthy volunteers by stimulation with phytohemagglutinin P ( Difco ) ( 12 ) .
Nuclear Extracts .
T lymphocytes were incubated with medium in the absence or presence of 20 ng of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) ( Sigma ) per ml and 0.5 uM ionomycin ( Calbiochem ) for 2 , 4 , and 8 hr .

were prepared as described by Ohisson et al .
( 13 ) , with minor modifications in the composition of buffers A and C and in the procedure for preparation of the nuclei .
Briefly 5-10 x 10® T lymphocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , resuspended in buffer A containing 2 ug of protease inhibitors ( leupeptin , antipain , and pepstatin ; Sigma ) per ml and 0.03 % Nonidet P-40 ( Sigma ) , and kept on ice for 5 min .
Nuclei were then pelleted at 200 x g and resuspended in buffer C containing 2 ug of protease inhibitors per ml .
All other steps were performed exactly as described in ref .

Oligonucleotides .
Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the NF-AT-binding site or NF-IL-2B site from the ZL2 enhancer ( Fig .
1 ) ( 2 ) , the NF-AT-like site from the IL4 enhancer ( 14 ) , and a mutant NF-AT response element were gifts of G. R. Crabtree ( Stanford University School of Med-icine , Stanford , CA ) .
The Oct-1 proximal ( OCT-1p ) site ( of the IL2 enhancer ) ( Fig .
1 ) ( 2 ) and the AP-1 site , derived from the human metallothionein II , gene promoter ( 15 ) , were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer 391 .
The NF-kB site , derived from the k light chain gene enhancer ( 16 ) , was purchased from GIBCO/BRL .
EMSA .
Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with the T4 polynucleotide kinase ( New England Biolabs ) / [ y `` 2P ] ATP ( New England Nuclear ) method .
Binding reactions were carried out in 16-20 ul ( final volume ) of binding buffer ( 17 ) containing 2.5-5 ug of nuclear proteins , 2-4 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia LKB ) , and 0.05-0.1 ng of *P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide .
For competition experiments , 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added together with the labeled ones .
The binding mixtures were incubated for 60 min at room temperature when NF-AT and NF-IL-2B were tested and for 30 min at 4°C when OCT-1p , NF-kB , or AP-1 were analyzed .
DNA-protein complexes were then resolved on a 5 % poly-acrylamide gel in 0.5 x TBE ( 90 mM Tris/90 mM boric acid/2 mM EDTA , pH 8 ) at 4°C followed by autoradiography .
Plasmid Constructs .
p-IL-2154CX , p22-6AXho , and pg42CAT constructs respectively contained the -319 to +52 sequence of JL2 , the minimal ZL2 promoter spanning -70 to +52 , and the y-fibrinogen promoter , placed upstream from the CAT gene .
NF-AT-CAT ( ®3 ) and OCT-lp CAT ( x4 ) constructs contained three and four copies , respectively , of the NF-AT or OCT-1p sites from the enhancer of ZL2 , all of them placed upstream of the y-fibrinogen promoter ( 2 ) .
All of these plasmids were provided by Gerald R. Crabtree .
AP-1-containing three copies of the AP-1 site from the human metallothionein IIa , gene promoter ( 15 ) , and NF-kB-CAT ( X4 ) , containing four copies of the sequence for the NF-kB site from the k light chain enhancer ( 16 ) , were constructed by ligating multimerized AP-1 and NF-kB oligonucleotides to the CAT-promoter plasmid ( Promega ) .
The plasmids were purified by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl/ ethidium bromide gradient and were sequenced by standard procedures ( 14 ) .
Transfection and CAT Assay .
DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection procedure was used to introduce plasmid DNA in the T lymphocytes .
Patient and control T-cell lines were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin P at 10 ug/ml in the presence of irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells , partially purified T-cell growth factor ( TCGF ) ( 12 ) , and 10 units of rIL-2 per ml .
The cells were harvested 4-5 days later , centrifuged over Ficoll , washed , resuspended at 20 x 10° cells per ml in 1 ml of a buffer ( 137 mM NaCI/§5 mM KCI/O0.4 mM Na ; HPO , /25 mM TrisHCl/0.1 mg of MgC ] ; per ml/O0.1 mg of CaCl ; per mi , pH 7.4 ) containing 20 ug of plasmid DNA and 0.25 mg of DEAE-dextran ( Sigma ) , and incubated for 15 min at room temperature .
The cells were then resuspended in 10 mt of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % ( vol/vol ) of fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C .
Thereafter , the cells were pelleted , resuspended Proc .

USA 90 ( 1993 ) 4729 in 20 mi of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FCS , 2.5 % TCGF , and rIL-2 at 10 units/ml , and equally divided in two flasks .
Approximately 40 hr after transfection , one of the aliquots was stimulated with 20 ng of PMA per ml and 0.5 uM ionomycin .
Eight hours later , the cells were spun down , washed with PBS at 4°C , and resuspended in 150 ul of 0.25 M TrisHCl ( pH 8 ) .
Cell extracts and the CAT assay were performed by following the Promega Protocol and Applications Guide .
CAT activity was equalized for the protein content ( cpm/ug ) .
In some experiments , the T lymphocytes were cotransfected with pCMV-human growth hormone ( hGH ) internal control plasmid ( pCMV-GH ) ( 18 ) to evaluate the transfection efficiency .
The hGH values were used to normalize the CAT specific activity .
Protein Assay .
Protein concentrations were determined with bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) protein assay reagent ( Pierce ) .
RESULTS We used EMSA to analyze the specific binding of nuclear proteins from patient and control T lymphocytes to functionally important sequences present in the ZL2 enhancer .
EMSA performed with an oligonucleotide containing the OCT-lp-binding site of the IL2 enhancer ( 2 ) revealed a specific retarded band when using nuclear extracts from control T lymphocytes either unstimulated or stimulated for 2 , 4 , and 8 hr with PMA and ionomycin ( Fig .
24 , lanes 6-10 ) .
The same shift pattern was obtained with nuclear extracts from patient T lymphocytes ( Fig .
24 , lanes 2-5 ) .
When nuclear extracts from stimulated T lymphocytes were used for the binding to oligonucleotides containing AP-1- , NF-kB- , or NF-IL2B-binding sites , we detected similar migration patterns in both patient and control ( Fig .
2B , lanes 3-6 and 8-13 ; Fig .
2C , lanes 3-5 and 7-10 ; and Fig .
2D , lanes 3-7 and 9-13 ) .
This binding activity was either not present or weakly expressed in nuclear extracts from unstimulated patient and control T lymphocytes ( Fig .
2B , lanes 2 and 7 ; Fig .
2C , lanes 2 and 6 ; and Fig .
2D , lanes 2 and 8 ) .
In contrast , using an oligonucleotide containing the NF-AT response element , we detected an abnormality in the shift pattern obtained with nuclear extracts from the patient T lymphocytes .
Fig .
3A shows that stimulation with PMA and ionomycin for 2 hr induced an NF-AT binding activity in the nuclear extracts from the patient T lymphocytes that was comparable to the control ( Fig .
3A , compare lane 3 with lane 9 ) .
However at 4 and 8 hr poststimulation , the patient DNA-NF-AT complex exhibited faster mobility as compared with the control ( Fig .
3A , compare lanes 10 and 11 with lanes 4 and 5 ) .
To evaluate whether such abnormal binding activity was common to NF-AT-like elements present in the enhancer of other lymphokine genes , we tested the ability of nuclear extracts from activated patient and control T lymphocytes to bind to an NF-AT-like sequence present in the enhancer of IL4 .
This sequence , which spans between -122 and -150 upstream from the transcription initiation site ( 14 ) , has 68 % homology with the NF-AT sequence in the IL2 enhancer .
Cross-competition experiments with oligonucleotides containing the IL2 or the IL4 NF-AT-like response element demonstrated the specificity of the IL4 sequence for NF-AT ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , EMSA performed with this sequence and nuclear extract from the patient T lymphocytes showed an abnormal shift pattern similar to that obtained with the NF-AT response element of the ZL2 enhancer ( compare lanes 10 and 11 of Fig .
3A with lanes 10 and 11 of Fig .
3B ) .
The protein subunits of NF-AT have not been fully char-acterized .
However NF-AT has been recently described as a protein complex having at least two components : a nuclear component that is inducible upon T-lymphocyte activation but is not T cell-restricted and a constitutive cytoplasmic component that is T cell-restricted and that translocates to the nucleus after a rise in intracellular free Ca** concentra- 4730 Immunology : Castigli et al .

- Interaction of nuclear proteins from patient and control T lymphocytes with functional response elements present in the enhancer of IL2 .
DNA-protein complexes were formed between *P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides and nuclear extracts from patient and control T lymphocytes stimulated with PMA and ionomycin ( Io ) .
% P-end-labeled OCT-lp ( 4 ) , AP-1 ( B ) , NF-kB ( C ) , and NF-IL-2B ( D ) oligonucleotides were incubated in the absence ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of nuclear extracts from patient and control T lymphocytes that were either left unstimulated ( lanes 0 ) , or stimulated for 2 , 4 , or 8 hr .
The arrows indicate the specific bands inhibited by the addition of unlabeled oligonucleotides ( competitor ) and not inhibited by the addition of an unlabeled unrelated sequence ( NF-kB ) in B , lane 13 , or by a mutant of NF-AT sequence in D , lanes 7 and 13. tion ( 19 ) .
The cytoplasmic and the nuclear components combine in the nucleus , and the resulting complex binds the DNA .
To examine whether the abnormal DNA-NF-AT complex was missing one of the identified components , we used preparations containing the cytoplasmic or the nuclear component isolated from Jurkat cells ( gift of G. R. Crabtree ) to complement the nuclear extracts from patient T lymphocytes stimulated for at least 4 hr .
The results are shown in Fig .
4 .
Neither the nuclear ( Fig .
4 , lane 6 ) nor the cytoplasmic ( Fig .
4 , lane 7 ) components were able to restore the normal electrophoretic mobility ( Fig .
4 , lanes 2 and 12 ) when added to the nuclear extracts from activated patient T lymphocytes .
The combination of the nuclear and the cytoplasmic components from Jurkat ( Fig .
4 , lanes 8 and 9 ) gave rise to a binding activity that exhibited faster electrophoretic mobility compared with the control DNA-NF-AT complex ( Fig .
4 , compare lane 8 with lane 12 ) , in agreement with the observation of Flanagan et al .
( 19 ) .
Interestingly this migration was similar to that observed with the nuclear extracts from the patient 's T cells ( Fig .
4 , compare lane 8 with lane 4 ) .
To analyze whether the abnormal NF-AT binding activity was associated with an impaired enhancer function , we transiently transfected patient and control T lymphocytes with constructs in which either the regulatory region of IL2 or multimers of the NF-AT site linked to the y-fibrinogen promoter were inserted upstream of the CAT reporter gene .
Inducible CAT activity was then determined in cell extracts from transfected T lymphocytes that were either left unstim- Immunology : Castigli et al .

Interaction of nuclear proteins present in nuclear extracts from patient and control T lymphocytes with response sequences present in the enhancer of IL2 and IL4 .
DNA-protein complexes were formed between *P-labeled NF-AT ( 4 ) or NFAT-IL-4 ( B ) double-stranded oligonucleotides and nuclear extracts from patient and control T lymphocytes stimulated with PMA and ionomycin ( Io ) .
The same results were obtained with nuclear extracts obtained from two separated preparations .
P-end-labeled oligonucleotides were incubated in the absence ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of nuclear extracts from patient and control T lymphocytes which were either left unstimulated ( lanes 2 and 8 ) , or stimulated for 2 ( lanes 3 and 9 ) , 4 ( lanes 4 and 10 ) , or 8 ( lanes 5-7 and 11-13 ) hr .
Arrows indicate the induced bands inhibited by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide ( lanes 6 and 12 ) and not inhibited by NF-AT mutant ( lanes 7 and 13 ) .
ulated or were stimulated for 8 hr with PMA and ionomycin .
Induction of CAT expression via the IL2 regulatory region was severely depressed in the stimulated patient T lymphocytes ( < 2 times the activity of unstimulated cells ) compared with control cells ( up to a I-fold increase ) ( Fig .
54 ) .
Most important , induction of CAT expression via NF-AT enhancer activity was significantly reduced ( by up to two-thirds ) in patient T lymphocytes compared with controls ( Fig .
5B ) .
The defective NF-AT enhancer function was specific because the enhancer function of another inducible nuclear factor ( 5 ) , OCT-1p , was comparable in patient and control T lymphocytes ( Fig .
5C ) .
The defect in the NF-AT enhancer function was also reproduced when patient T lymphocytes were compared with T-cell lines derived from different donors ( data not shown ) .
Transfections with constructs in which multimers of AP-1 or NF-kB sites directed the transcription of CAT gene resulted in similarly high basal CAT activity in both patient and control T lymphocytes , which was not further induced upon stimulation with PMA and ionomycin ( data not shown ) .
These findings might reflect the transfection conditions ; culture of transfected T lymphocytes with TCGF and rIL-2 during the 40 hr after transfection could have induced AP-1 and NF-kB via signal transduction pathways activated by the interaction of IL-2 with its receptor or of other growth factors with their receptors .
In contrast , NF-AT and OCT -1p are both transcription factors that are responsive only to signals derived from the T-cell receptor .
DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that the binding and the enhancer activity of NF-AT are selectively defective ( Figs .
3A and 5B ) in a patient with a multiple lymphokine deficiency .
The faster electrophoretic mobility of the DNA-NF-AT complex indicated that the patient T lymphocytes are missing a component of the NF-AT protein complex .

Enhancer activity in PMA- and ionomycin-stimulated patient and control T lymphocytes transiently transfected with expression vectors containing the entire IL2 regulatory region ( IL2 bars ) or the IL-2 minimal promoter ( Control bars ) coupled upstream of the CAT gene ( A4 ) ; three copies of NF-AT site from the IL2 enhancer fused to the y-fibrinogen promoter ( NF-AT bars ) or the y-fibrinogen promoter alone ( Control bars ) , which are in turn ligated to the CAT gene ( B ) ; or four copies of OCT-1p site from the IL2 enhancer driving the transcription of the CAT gene through y-fibrinogen promoter ( OCT-lp bars ) or the yfibrinogen promoter alone ( Control bars ) ( C ) .
Bars labeled `` *-* represent the background measured with untransfected cells .
CAT activities were normalized for protein concentration and transfection efficiency and are expressed as cpm/ug .
The numbers over the hatched bars indicate the fold increase of the CAT activity in transfected T lymphocytes ( ratio of cpm/ug of stimulated cells : cpm/ug of unstimulated cells ) .
In A and C , one representative experiment of two and in B , one representative experiment of six performed with the same plasmid and the same control T cell line are shown .
nent of NF-AT , suggested that the patient 's T lymphocytes lacked a component of the NF-AT protein complex that was not present either in the nuclear or cytoplasmic components of NF-AT already identified in Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
4 ) ( 19 ) .
At present we can only speculate on the nature of the patient NF-AT defect .
The defect may directly involve a component of NF-AT .
Alternatively , the NF-AT defect may be the result of a distinct abnormality in the activation pathways regulating NF-AT assembly .
Because of its faster mobility , the patient DNA-NF-AT complex seems to lack an-as-yet unidentified component that is important for NF-AT function as a transcriptional activator ( Figs .
3 A and C and 5 B and A ) .
The delayed appearance of the aberrant DNA-NF-AT complex suggests a susceptibility of a mutated Proc .
Natl .

USA 90 ( 1993 ) component of NF-AT to proteolysis .
Alternatively , the missing component could be a protein that must be rapidly synthesized or modified upon stimulation .
A defect affecting the availability or the regulation of this component could account for the observed abnormality in NF-AT .
This defect affected not only the NF-AT interaction with its response element present in the enhancer of IL2 but also its interaction ( Fig .
3B ) with a similar response element present in the enhancer of IL4 , the transcription of which is defective in the patient T lymphocytes .
These findings raise the possibility that NF-AT may play a role in the transcription of IL3 and ILS5 , which are also defective in the patient T lymphocytes .
While the role of NF-AT in the regulation IL2 is well established , its role in the transcriptional activation of other lymphokine genes remains to be identified .
It is possible that the defect in NF-AT activity could account for the multiple lymphokine deficiency in this child .
This is supported by the presence of an NF-AT-like response element in at least one other T cell-restricted lymphokine gene that is defective in the patient-namely , ZL4 .
It is also possible that the defective component of NF-AT could be involved in the activity of distinct trans-acting factors involved in the regulation of other lymphokines in T cells .
Further studies on the nature of NF-AT and on the regulation of the T lymphocyte-specific lymphokine genes are needed to elucidate the precise nature of the gene responsible for the multiple lymphokine defect in this patient .
