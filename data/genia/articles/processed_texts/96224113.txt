8942-8950 , 1996 Printed in U.S.A. Interactions of a Transcriptional Activator in the env Gene of the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus with Activation-dependent , T Cell-specific Transacting Factors* ( Received for publication , October 19 , 1995 , and in revised form , January 22 , 1996 ) Damaraju Sambasivarao and Verner Pacetkaut From the Department of Biochemistry , Medical Sciences Building , University of Alberta , Edmonton , Alberta T6G 2H7 , Canada The mouse mammary tumor virus erv gene contains a transcriptional activator ( META ) that can control transcription of the adjacent long terminal repeat region .
Transcriptional control by META parallels that of several lymphokine genes , being specific to T cells , dependent on their activation , and inhibited by the immu-nosuppressive drug cyclosporine ( CsA ) .
DNase I footprinting indicated that nuclear factors from activated T lymphocytes bound a promoter-proximal site , META ( P ) , and a promoter-distal site , META ( D+ ) , within the 400-base pair META region .
Nuclear factors from unstimulated , but not from activated cells , bound a site , META ( D- ) , adjacent to META ( D+ ) .
META ( D+ ) directed transcription of a linked luciferase gene , and gel shift analysis revealed binding of inducible , CsA-sensitive T cell factors , in parallel with transfection results .
Authentic NFAT and NF- < B targets did not compete for the META ( D+ ) binding factor ( s ) .
The SV40 core sequence competed for META ( D+ ) binding factors , but META ( D+ ) failed to compete for the complexes obtained with the SV40 probe .
Our results , taken together , indicate that META ( D+ ) is a novel transcriptional enhancer element that is similar in its cell-type specificity , activation de-pendence , and CsA sensitivity to the NFAT element .
It may be relevant to the role of MMTV in expression of MIs antigens or the induction of T cell lymphomas .
Mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) is involved in at least three different biological processes : induction of mammary adenocarcinoma , generation of thymic lymphoma , and expression of minor histocompatibility superantigens of the Mls type .
The relatively large and complex long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is implicated in all three responses .
Enhancers in the LTR activate cellular proto-oncogenes to induce tumorigen-esis in mammary tumors ( 1 ) .

ants that induce T lymphomas rather than mammary adeno-carcinomas carry large deletions of LTR sequences ( 2 ) , whose absence or modification is necessary for T cell tumors to develop ( 3 ) .
And in the case of the minor Mls antigens , the LTR encodes the protein antigen in one of several forms ( 4 , 5 ) .
In each of these three systems , there is a requirement for MMTV-related transcriptional activity in lymphocytes , although the molecular mechanisms regulating transcription control may differ between them .
The requirement for expression in lymphocytes includes the induction of tumors by the mammotropic strains of MMTV , as part of the mechanism of transmission to the mammary epithelium .
This participation requires expression of the virally encoded MIs antigen ( 6 ) .
The LTR contains strong , corticosteroid-inducible transcriptional activator elements ( 7 ) , but it is not clear what their role is , if any , in transcriptional control in lymphocytes .
The LTR of MMTV resembles that of other retroviruses in that it contains the transcriptional control elements and start site for viral RNA synthesis .
We have described a second , novel promoter located in the env gene of MMTV , which is activated in certain T lymphoma cell lines ( 8 , 9 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
This promoter generates transcripts of the LTR found in the mouse EL4.E1 cell line ( 8 , 14 ) , in which the amplified genomic copies of MMTV provirus contain a large deletion typical of these lymphomas .
The starting point of the transcript lies at position 7247 in the MMTV map , within the env gene ( 8 , 9 ) ( Fig .
1a ) .
The relevant promoter is apparently controlled by the sequence immediately upstream of it in the env gene .
The transcriptional activity of a 411-bp env gene segment ( Fig .
1b ) , which we term META ( for MMTV env transcriptional activator ) was established by transient transfection experiments ( 9 ) , and it was further shown that this activity resembled closely the activity of the interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) promoter in the same cells .
It was restricted to T helper lymphocytes , it was dependent on cellular activation through antigen receptors or their mimics , and its induction was inhibited by the drug cyclosporine ( CsA ) .
META was active in mouse and human T lymphocyte cell lines that resemble T helper cells by being inducible for lymphokine synthesis , including mouse EL4.E1 cells , a mouse T hybridoma cell line , and the human Jurkat cell line .
It was not active in Hela cells , or , under the conditions studied , in a mouse B cell line or a cyto-toxic T lymphocyte cell line .
The env gene was shown to contain both a transcriptional activator and a start site for mRNA synthesis .
In this paper , we have examined META for interactions with activation-induced DNA-binding factors and have identified an element that can account for the transcriptional control properties of the env gene itself .
The induction of transcription from the META promoter resembles the activation of IL2 transcription in the same cells .
Expression of the IL2 gene in T helper lymphocytes is controlled primarily by the sequence lying within 300 bp upstream 8942 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog T Cell-specific Enhancer in MMTV env Gene 8943 of the transcriptional start site ( 15 , 16 ) .
Several transcription factors interact with this region , including AP1 , AP3 , Oct-1 , NF-kB , and NFAT ( 13 , 17 , 18 ) .
The NF- « B and NFAT sites show activation-dependent binding with their relevant factors in vivo ( 19 ) .
NFAT is the most sensitive of these sites to CsA , as its binding factor is completely blocked by the drug .
Both NF- « B and AP3 are somewhat less sensitive ( 20 ) .
The META region contains several transcription factor binding motifs , but none with the exact NFAT sequence of the human IL2 gene ( Fig .
1c ) .
Thus , it was of interest to determine whether an element could be identified that accounted for the characteristic transcriptional activating properties of META .
This paper describes in detail such an element , which we term META ( D+ ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells-Jurkat ( human T cell leukemia ) , EL4.E1 ( mouse T-lympho-ma ) , 8194 ( mouse myeloma ) , and Helia ( endothelial carcinoma ) cell lines were maintained in RHFM medium comprising RPMI 1640 , 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.4 ) , 100 uM 2-mercaptoethanol , antibiotics , and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( 9 ) .
Nuclear Extracts-Jurkat cells were stimulated for 4-6 h with 15 ng/ml 12-phorbol 13-myristate acetate ( PMA ) plus 1.5 um ionomycin , or with PMA plus 0.5 pm A23187 .
IL2 was measured by bioassay ( 21 ) .
CsA was present at 100 ng/ml where indicated .
Nuclear extracts from unstimulated and stimulated cells were prepared by the lysolecithin lysis method ( 22 ) .
Nuclear extracts were aliquoted , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at -70 °C .
Protein concentrations in cell extracts were determined with a Coomassie protein assay kit ( Bio-Rad ) .
DNA Methodology and Reagents-Restriction enzyme digestions , DNA polymerase reactions , ligations , end labeling , agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) , gel elution of DNA fragments , and Sephadex G-50 spin column chromatography were carried out by standard protocols ( 23 ) .
Oligonucleotides were obtained from the DNA synthesis facilities of either the Departments of Microbiology or Biochemistry at the University of Alberta .
Molecular biological reagents and enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies , Inc. ( Burlington , ON ) , the luciferase reporter vector pGL2 from Promega ( Madison , WI ) , Maxam-Gilbert chemical sequencing kit from DuPont NEN , and the Maxi Plasmid DNA purification kit from Qiagen Inc. ( Charlesworth , CA ) .
PMA , ionomycin , A23187 , luciferin , acetyl coenzyme A , and DNase I enzyme were purchased from Sigma .
CsA was a gift from Sandoz Canada Inc. ( Dorval , Quebec ) .
DNA sequences were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using primers described in Table I , carrying the prefixes S ( for sense orientation ) and A ( for antisense ) .
Primers and templates were heat denatured and annealed ( 23 ) .
Typical conditions for the PCR were : 10 mx Tris-HC ] , pH 8.3 , 50 mm KCl , 0.01 % gelatin , 3.0 mm MgCl , , 0.2 mM dNTPs , 80 nM primers , 6.25 ng of plasmid template , and 1.25 units of Tag DNA polymerase , in a total volume of 50 ul .
The Hybaid thermal reactor ( Bio/Can Scientific , Toronto , ON ) was programmed for the following conditions : 96 °C for 5 min , then two cycles of 94 °C for 1 min , 45 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min ; followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min , 60 °C for 1 min , 72 °C for 1 min ; and ending with an extension reaction at 72 °C for 3 min .
PCR products were separated by PAGE in 1 x TBE ( 89 mm Tris , 89 mM borie acid , 2 mM EDTA ) .
Plasmids-Numbering of META segments is based on the transcriptional start site of the META-driven promoter in MMTV ( 9 ) .
Construction of the plasmid pBLCAT2-C30 containing META sequences from -29 to -4839 ( Fig .
1b ) has been described ( 9 ) .
Plasmids pGL2 promoter and control vectors are the luciferase reporter plasmids containing the SV40 promoter , and the SV40 promoter plus enhancer , respectively .
Plasmid pDS-tk13 has the thymidine kinase ( tk ) promoter in place of the SV40 promoter in the pGL2 promoter vector background , and was constructed as follows .
Plasmids pBLCAT2-C30 and pGL2 promoter vectors were digested with BgilI and HindIII , respectively , and the recessed ends were filled in using the Klenow DNA polymerase enzyme .
Linearized , blunt-ended pBLCAT-C30 was cut with BamHI to yield the 411-bp META fragment , a 168-bp tk promoter fragment , and a 4.3-kb vector DNA fragment .
Digestion of the linearized , blunt-ended pGL2 promoter vector with Bg/II yielded a 203-bp fragment containing the SV40 promoter and 5.59-kb vector DNA fragment .
The tk promoter fragment generated from pBLCAT-30 , and the linearized pGL2 vector segment lacking the SV40 promoter were purified on agarose gels and ligated to yield the pDS-tk13 enhancerless luciferase reporter vector .
A number of double-stranded DNAs were prepared by PCR amplification using primers described in Table I. META ( D+ ) DNA with protruding 5° AA ( 821 ) and TT ( A21 ) termini were first filled in using Klenow DNA polymerase and then blunt-end ligated for 16 h at 14 °C to generate multimers .
These were cloned upstream of the tk promoter in pDS-tk13 to generate recombinant plasmids pDSD61 to pDSD65 ( see Fig .
5 ) .
The head-to-tail configuration of the META ( D+ ) segments generated a Hpal restriction enzyme site , which was used in conjunction with other methods to determine the orientation and copy number of D ( + ) enhancer constructs ( head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations lack the Apel site ) .
Plasmid pDSM25F is a luciferase reporter plasmid derived from pDS-tk13 harboring the META fragment extending from -29 to -429 upstream of the tk promoter .
The complete META fragment ( 411 bp ) was liberated from pBLCAT2-C30 by Sail digestion , purified by PAGE , and ligated into Xhol-cut pDS-tk13 to generate pDSM25F .
Human genomic IL2 sequences from -98 to -362 or from +45 to -180 relative to the transcription start site were amplified by PCR using primer pairs S17 and A17 ( for -98 to -362 ) or S16 and A16 ( for +45 to -180 ) ( Table I ) .
The hIL2 PCR product for -98 to -362 region was gel-purified , digested with EcoR I and HindIII , and ligated into pGEM-3Z vector cut with EcoRI and HindIII .
The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli DHS , and plated on LB agar-ampicillin indicator plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl B-D-galactoside and isopropyl-l-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside for blue/white colony selection .
White colonies were selected , and the recombinant plasmid pDIL2 thus generated was purified and sequenced .
Recombinant constructs were confirmed by both sequencing and/or restriction digestion analysis .
DNase I Footprint Analysis-Plasmid pBLCAT2-C30 was used as a source of META ( -439 to -29 , Fig .
1b ) .
For upper strand labeling , the plasmid was linearized with Xbal , dephosphorylated , and end-labeled using [ y-*°P ] JATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase I. Radiolabeled DNA was separated from unincorporated label on a Sephadex G50 spin column .
Psfl digestion of this DNA resulted in 528-bp labeled META fragment with flanking vector sequences , a 9-bp labeled Psfl-Xbal fragment from the multicloning site , and the remaining 4363-bp vector DNA .
The lower strand of META was labeled at the XbaI end starting with pBLCAT2-C30 containing META ( -29 to -489 ) in the reverse orientation .
HindIII digestion of this DNA resulted in the release of a 406-bp labeled META fragment along with labeled 20-bp Xbal-HindlIlI fragment from the multicloning site and the 4485-bp of the vector DNA .
The labeled META DNA along with the vector DNA fragments obtained by these procedures was used without further fractionation .
Binding reactions and DNase I digestions were carried out at room temperature as described in the Life Technologies , Inc. DNase I footprinting manual , with minor modifications .
Briefly , the assay system contained 10 mm Tris-HCl , pH 7.0 , 2 mm CaCl , , 0.5 mm DTT , 0.5 mm phenyImethylsulfony ] fluoride , 30 mM KCl , 2.5 ug/ml bovine serum , 0.5 % glycerol , 100 ug of Jurkat cell nuclear protein , and 2 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) in a reaction volume of 50 ul .
Reactions were incubated for 10 min followed by the addition of 1 ng of DNA probe ( 20,000 cpm ) .
After an additional incubation of 20 min , 50 Ll of DNase I buffer ( 10 mm HEPES , pH 7.8 , 5 mm MgCl , , and 1 mm CaCl , ) was added , and 50 ng of DNase I. Digestion was carried out for 1 min , and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 wl of stop buffer ( 10 mm MES , pH 7.0 , 15 mm EDTA , 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 250 pg of salmon sperm DNA , and 10 pg of proteinase K ) .
Proteinase K digestion was continued for 30 min at 37 °C .
The reactions were extracted with phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 25:24:1 ) , precipitated using ethanol and sodium acetate , dissolved in formamide loading buffer , and subjected to 6 % acrylamide , 7 M urea PAGE ( 0.4 mm thick gel ) in 1 X TBE buffer using a Life Technologies , Inc. vertical gel apparatus .
Dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at -70 °C with an intensifying screen .
Mobility Shift Assays-Single-stranded oligonucleotides ( sense strands ) were end-labeled using [ y- `` °P ] JATP and polynucleotide kinase , the kinase was heat-denatured , and the fragments were annealed to complementary antisense oligonucleotides .
Unincorporated label was separated on G-50 Sephadex spin columns .
Binding reactions were carried out with 0.5 nM probe ( 5,000-10,000 cpm ) in a final reaction volume of 20 ul at room temperature .
Reaction mixtures contained 25 mm HEPES , pH 7.8 , 75 mM KCl , 1 mm EDTA , 0.5 mm DTT , 0.5 mm phenyImethylsulfonyl fluoride , 5 % glycerol , 3 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , and 10 ug of Jurkat cell nuclear extracts .
Probe was added to the reaction mix after 10 min , or a total of 25 min when cold competitor DNA was included .
Binding reactions were then continued for 30 min , analyzed on 4 % acrylamide ( 1.5-mm-thick gels ) in 1 X TBE at room temperature .
Dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at -70 °C with an intensifying screen .

Structure of META .
The 9.9-kb MMTV genome is represented in a , with the META segment located in the env gene .
The LTRs ( 1328 bp ) contain the conventional MMTV promoter , responsible for the synthesis of MMTV RNA , which originates near the 3 ' end of the 5 ' LTR .
The MMTV provirus from which META was first isolated , derived from EL4.E1 T lymphoma cells , carried a 494-bp deletion within the LTR , indicated by the shaded box in the figure .
META is responsible for the activation-dependent , CsA-suppressible transcription described earlier ( 8 , 9 ) , which originates within the env gene and copies the 3 ' LTR .
b , pBLCAT2-C30 is a plasmid in which a META sequence lacking the transcriptional start site was cloned as a BamHI insert upstream of the herpes simplex virus tk promoter and the CAT coding region ( 9 ) .
It represents segment 6814-7212 of MMTV .
c , the nucleotide sequence of the META-BamHI fragment in pBLCAT2-C30 , and derived plasmids used in this study .
Sequence numbering here is with respect to the transcription initiation site within META , which occurs at position 7246 of the milk-borne virus sequence ( 10 ) .
Nucleotide positions at the ends of the fragment that were altered to generate restriction enzyme sites are shown in lowercase .
The underlined segments represent restriction enzyme sites ( thin line ) and sequence motifs that are candidates for transcription factor binding sites ( Reavy underline ) .
The potential binding sequences , labeled `` M- `` ( for motif ) , were identified based on their similarity to the consensus binding sequences for the transcription factors indicated ( 11 ) : AP2 and AP3 ( activating proteins 2 and 3 , respectively ) ; MAF , mammary cell activating factor ( 12 ) ; TCEp , proximal T cell element of the IL2 gene ( 13 ) ; Pu box , proximal purine box of mouse or human IL2 enhancer .
Regions identified by DNase I footprinting are delineated by boxes ( META D segments , META P ; see Fig .
2 and text ) .
The sequence shown here is derived from the MMTV provirus ( clone C30 ) used in this and previous work ( 8 , 9 ) , and differs slightly from that of the milk-borne virus ( 10 ) .
Transfections and Measurement of Luciferase Activity-Purified plasmid DNA that was > 90 % closed circular , as judged by gel analysis and ethidium bromide fluorescence quantitation ( 27 ) was used in the DEAE-dextran transfection protocol ( 9 ) .
A total of 15 ug of DNA was used in a volume of 2 ml .
Following transfection , cells were resus-pended , divided , and maintained in RHFM medium for 36-42 h. Cells were induced for 6 h by adding PMA plus A23187 with or without CsA .
Cells were pelleted , washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline , and resuspended in lysis buffer : 1 % Triton X-100 , 25 mm glycylglycine , pH 7.8 , 15 mm MgSQO , , 4 mM EGTA , and 1 mm DTT ( 28 ) .
Luciferase activities in whole cell extracts were measured as described in the Promega luciferase assay manual using a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer .

DNase I footprinting analysis of META .
The lower ( 4 ) or the upper ( B ) strand of META was end-labeled and subjected to DNase I digestion in the presence of nuclear extracts from uninduced Jurkat cells ( - ) , or cells stimulated ( + ) with PMA plus ionomycin ( A ) or PMA plus A23187 ( B ) .
The positions of segments differentially protected in induced and uninduced extracts are indicated as `` D `` ( distal ) or `` P `` ( proximal ) on the line representation of the sequence on the left , which also shows the location of the label ( * ) .
Protected regions META ( D- ) and META ( D+ ) were observed with the uninduced and induced nuclear extracts , respectively , and region P was found to be weakly protected with induced extracts .
N , no nuclear extract ; @ , G/A , and T/C indicate Maxam-Gilbert chemical sequencing reactions .

RESULTS DNA Footprint Analysis of the Interaction of Nuclear Factors from Jurkat Cells with the META Sequence-The complete META segment of MMTV , comprising the 411-bp region lying between 29 and 439 bp upstream of the novel env promoter ( Fig .
1 ) , has previously been shown to mediate inducible , CsA-suppressible , and T lymphocyte-specific expression of reporter genes ( 9 ) .
Overall , it responds in parallel with lymphokine enhancers , such as that of IL2 , in T cell lines .
We therefore carried out DNase I footprinting experiments to look for interactions with nuclear factors from Jurkat cells , a human T cell line that is induced to synthesize IL2 by a combination of PMA and a calcium ionophore .
Nuclear extracts from uninduced Jurkat cells , and from cells stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin , were examined .
The footprint pattern shown in Fig .
24 revealed two regions of protection with induced extracts , compared to extracts from unstimulated cells .
These are referred to as proximal ( META ( P ) ) and distal ( META ( D ) ) .
META ( P ) is located around -116 to -146 relative to the META transcriptional start site .
Extracts from induced cells showed partial or faint protection of this region , compared to uninduced cells .
In three independent experiments with end-labeled lower strand , partial protection of META ( P ) was consistently observed .
On the other hand , META ( D ) comprised two strong and discrete footprints with extracts of stimulated cells , one in the -296 to -323 region and the other in the -325 to -349 region .
To further delineate the META ( D ) footprint , we performed DNase I digestions using the upper strand of META ( Fig .
2B ) .

Specifically , the -296 to -323 region was protected by uninduced nuclear extracts , whereas the -325 to -349 region was protected with induced extracts .
We have repeated these experiments three times with each of the lower and upper strands , using either PMA/ionomycin or PMA/A23187 as inducing agents ( the two calcium ionophores are similarly effective in inducing IL2 synthesis in Jurkat cells , and showed no difference in footprinting results ) .
The META ( D ) footprint shown in Fig .
24 was the only case in which both parts of META ( D ) were protected by nuclear extracts from induced cells only .
All of the experiments in which the upper strand was labeled were similar to the result in Fig .
2B .
Two out of three experiments with the lower strand labeled also showed this protection pat-tern , i.e .
protection of one element of META ( D ) in unstimulated cells ( META ( D- ) ) , and of an adjacent element in stimulated cells ( META ( D+ ) ) .
The single anomalous result shown in Fig .
2A , i.e .
protection of the complete META ( D ) region by induced extracts , did not result from either peculiarities of the binding reaction or limited resolution at the top of the gel ; the results were reproducible with that extract and were unchanged upon longer electrophoresis .
In all experiments , however , META ( D ) and META ( P ) always exhibited differential protection , and no protected regions other than these were seen in the 411-bp META sequence .
To summarize , the META ( D+ ) element was consistently protected by extracts from induced cells , relative to uninduced extracts .
In most cases , META ( D- ) was protected by extracts from uninduced cells ( the exception being the result of Fig .
24 ) .
META ( P ) was protected weakly by extracts of induced cells .
META ( D+ ) protection was the most strongly correlated with conditions of transcriptional induction of META itself ( 9 ) and of lymphokines , and it was therefore selected for further analysis .
Binding of Jurkat Nuclear Factors to the META ( D ) Ele-ments-The META ( D+ ) and META ( D- ) elements are delin- eated in Fig .
1C .
Oligonucleotides containing these sequences ( Table I ) were used to look for binding factors by gel shift analysis with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
The D ( + ) probe ( Zanes 1-4 ) demonstrated one very strong complex ( arrow 1 ) , and one that was barely detectable ( arrow 2 ) with extracts from unstimulated cells .
Under conditions of transcriptional activation , a very strong additional band of intermediate mobility ( arrow 3 ) was seen , and a greatly enhanced amount of complex in the region of the slower constitutive band ( arrow 2 ) .
Formation of these complexes was almost completely abolished by CsA , which blocks activation of META transcription ( 8 , 9 ) .
The META ( D- ) probe ( Zanes 5-8 ) showed a strong band with uninduced cell extracts , which was almost completely abolished under conditions of cellular induction , and was partially restored when CsA was present ( arrow 4 ) .
The results of gel shift analysis are consistent overall with the results from DNase footprinting , in that a specific complex was found under conditions of transcriptional activation when META ( D+ ) was used as the probe , whereas the reciprocal pattern was seen with META ( D- ) as probe .
Specificity of the META ( D+ ) Inducible Complex-The binding of nuclear factor ( s ) to the META ( D+ ) probe was investigated by using unlabeled homologous and heterologous competing oligonucleotides ( Fig .
4 ) .
The signal due to binding of both constitutive and induction-dependent factors to META ( D+ ) was titrated out by unlabeled META ( D+ ) probe , but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide derived from a nearby , but unrelated , META sequence of similar length .
( The nonspecific competitor contains an element similar to the AP3/TCEp motif of the upstream control region of IL2 ( 13 ) ) .
The 41-bp META ( D+ ) probe contains an Rsal site between positions -334 and -333 ( Fig .
1 and Table I ) .
When the probe was treated with Rsal , no retarded band was seen with any extracts ( data not shown ) .

Binding of nuclear factors to the META ( D ) region .
Mobility shift assays were carried out using META ( D+ ) or META ( D- ) probes at 0.5 nm .
The probe for META ( D+ ) consisted of oligonucleotides S21 + A21 , and the probe for META ( D- ) , of oligonucleotides 822 + A22 ( Table I ) .

The complex observed with the META ( D- ) probe ( arrow 4 ) was seen with uninduced extracts and with extracts induced in the presence of CsA , and was barely visible with extracts from induced cells .

This segment contains an AP3/NF- « B motif ( see Fig .
7 and `` Discussion `` ) .
The induced and constitutive complexes of META ( D+ ) differed in sensitivity to the addition of unlabeled homologous probe , with the induced complex ( Fig .
4 , arrow ) showing a greater sensitivity , possibly reflecting a lower concentration of the factor responsible .
The results of competition show that the binding was specific and saturable .
The META ( D+ ) Sequence Confers Inducible , CSA-suppress-ible , Transcriptional Activation-To determine the enhancer function of META ( D+ ) in intact cells , we transfected Jurkat cells with plasmids containing various META ( D+ ) -related con-structs , driving the expression of a luciferase reporter gene ( Fig .
5 ) .
The activities of the enhancer constructs were compared to the relevant promoter constructs lacking enhancers .
The pGL-2 plasmid containing an SV40 promoter/enhancer sequence , included as a control , showed increased luciferase gene expression on stimulation with PMA plus A23187 , as has been observed by others ( 13 , 24 , 29 ) .
The activity observed with the full-length 411-bp META region ( pDSM25F ) linked to the thymidine kinase promoter was also stimulated by activation with PMA and calcium ionophore , and this activity was CsA-sensitive .
This is parallel to the effect of META on the expression of the CAT gene reporter ( 9 ) .
When individual META ( D+ ) enhancer elements were linked to the tk promoter , luciferase expression was also induced by PMA plus A23187 , with the strength of induction being related to the number of elements placed in series .
Activation did not require the elements to be oriented in one direction , and in every case was strongly sensitive to CsA .
A 7-mer of META ( D+ ) generated more than a 100-fold induction upon activation , compared to the enhancerless promoter construct , with 93 % of the induced activity being inhibited by CsA .

tively more by activation than was the pGL-2 SV40 construct , under induced conditions they were higher in absolute level as well , with the most powerful , pDSD 65 , being almost 100 times as strongly expressed as the SV40 enhancer-promoter combination ( numerical data are given in Fig .
5 , bottom panel ) .
Full Activation of the META ( D+ ) Enhancer Requires Both PMA and Calcium Ionophore and Is T Cell-specific-In an earlier study we showed that the 411-bp META fragment mediates T cell-specific , induction-dependent expression of the CAT reporter gene ( 9 ) .
In that study , META was activated in both mouse ( EL4.E1 ) and human ( Jurkat ) T helper cell lines , and in a mouse T helper hybridoma cell line .
The dual signal requirement and T cell specificity of the META ( D+ ) enhancer element was therefore investigated using several cell lines , including Jurkat transfected with plasmid pDSD 65 ( Fig .
6 ) .
Exposure of the transfected cells to calcium ionophore alone had no significant effect on the reporter construct .
Stimulation with PMA alone increased the activity to about 37 % of the maximum activity generated with both PMA and A23187 .
CsA inhibited 87 % of the fully induced activity , whereas PMA-induced activity was only inhibited by 33 % .
The activity of the META ( D+ ) enhancer was dependent on the type of cell used for transfection .
The T lymphocyte cell lines EL4.E1 and Jurkat showed high levels of inducible activity compared to the non-T cells 8194 and Hela .
It is noteworthy that both $ 194 and Hela cells contain active NF- « B and AP3 factors under constitutive and/or inducing conditions , yet did not significantly activate META ( D+ ) .
Comparison of the META ( D ) Sequence to Various Cellular and Viral Enhancers-Examination of the META ( D ) region revealed several potential motifs for binding transcription factors API , AP2 , AP3 , NFAT , and NF- « B ( Fig .

Data are presented from a single transfection experiment , but similar results were observed in at least three independent experiments .
lated Jurkat cells ( 30 ) , TCF-1 , -2 , and -3 from EL4 cells ( 31 ) , NP-TCII from unstimulated Jurkat cells ( 32 ) , AP3 from Hela cells , and authentic NF- « B from B-lymphocytes ( 25 , 33 ) .
These classes of proteins also bind the NF- « B sequence in the human IL2 enhancer ( 13 , 18 , 31 ) .
The META ( D+ ) sequence shows similarity to AP3 and NF- « B binding sites .
Except for the NF- « B element of the IL2 enhancer ( tGAAA ) , all others shown in Fig .
7 have the conserved motif GGAAA characteristic of the binding regions for AP3 , NF-kB , NFAT , and other members of the Dorsal/Rel family of transcription factors .
The NP-TC II motif in the SV40 enhancer resembles the NF- « B binding site , but it binds a different factor ( 32 ) .
Enhancers from META ( D+ ) , SV40 , and IL2 have 7-8 nucleotide matches to the consensus NF- « B site ( GGGA ( A/C ) TN ( T/C ) CC ) ( 11 ) .
The NFAT core sequence of the human IL2 enhancer exhibits 6/10 matches to the consensus AP3 binding sequence ( TGTGG { ( A/T ) ( A/T ) ( A/T ) GT ) ( 11 ) .
We therefore used IL2 enhancer DNA or specific oligonucleotides to compete for binding of the META ( D+ ) element to its factor ( s ) in nuclear extracts .
The SV40 Oligonucleotide Competes for the META ( D+ ) Binding Factor , but NF-kB Does Not-We investigated the binding of factors in activated Jurkat nuclei to the META ( D+ ) probe in the presence of competing SV40 promoter sequences and hIL2 NF- « B oligonucleotides .
SV40 contains an AP3 motif ( 33 ) , and also an element that binds both the inducible factor NF- « B ( 34 ) and factor NF-TCII ( 32 ) , which is expressed constitutively in T and B lymphocyte cell lines .
The mobility shift experiments shown in Fig .
8 demonstrate that the 22-bp SV40 oligonucleotide ( Zanes 3-6 ) competed quite efficiently for the factor ( s ) binding META ( D+ ) , comparable to the META ( D+ ) self-competition ( cf .
lane 4 of Fig .
4 ) .
On the other hand , the hIL2 NF- « B element , which shows only a limited similarity to META ( D+ ) ( Fig .
7 ) , was a poor competitor ; even a 200-fold molar excess produced only a modest diminution of the signal ( Zanes 7-11 ) .
An oligonucleotide containing the mammary cell activating factor-like region of META ( -126 to -96 , see Fig .
1 and Table 1 ) , and which also contains the central GGAAA pentanucleotide characteristic of the AP3 or NFAT sites , did not compete ( Zanes 12-14 ) , suggesting that sequences flanking the pentanucleotide are essential for META ( D+ ) binding .
The competition by SV40 for the META ( D+ ) -binding factor ( s ) prompted us to examine the reciprocal situation ( Fig .
9 ) .
The SV40 probe exhibited a mobility shift with nuclear extracts from both control and induced Jurkat cells , but the two patterns were completely different .
Nuclear factors from uninduced cells ( lane 1 ) yielded one very weak band of fairly high mobility , whereas induced extracts ( Zane 2 ) yielded two different bands , much stronger and of lower mobility .
The two activation-dependent bands were not significantly affected by CsA .
META ( D+ ) did not compete effectively for the induced com-plexes , compared to the SV40 sequence itself .
The human IL2-derived NF- « B probe competed moderately well for the lower mobility SV40 activation-dependent complex , but not for the other one .
Search for a META ( D+ ) Competitor Sequence in the IL2 Gene-One of the interesting features of the META ( D+ ) complex is that its induction is abolished by the immunosuppres-sive drug CsA .
This is characteristic of very few transcriptional activating elements , chief among these being the NFAT element of the IL2 and other cytokine genes ( 20 ) .
Although NFAT and META ( D+ ) elements both contain a central GGAAA pen-tanucleotide , there is no overall similarity between them ( Fig .
7 ) .
Nevertheless , because of their functional similarity , we tested human IL2 upstream DNA probes , as well as an oligonucleotide carrying the NFAT motif , for their ability to compete with META ( D+ ) .
DNA from the human IL2 gene representing the regions +45 to -183 , -98 to -362 , as well as the AP1 and NFAT oligonucleotides were tested as competitors individually .
The oligonucleotides corresponding to the various regions in META , namely AP3/TCEp , polypurine element , and mammary 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 8948 cell activating factor , which harbor the GG { ( A/T ) ( A/T ) ( A/T ) motifs ( Fig .
1c ) were also end-labeled and tested individually in mobility shift assays .
However , the induction-dependent binding to META ( D+ ) was not affected by any of the IL2 enhancer elements ( data not shown ) .
The overall conclusion is that there is a major binding site for inducible , CsA-suppressible nuclear factors in the META ( D+ ) region , and that it is activated in parallel with , but distinct from , the IL2 NFAT site .

T Cell-specific Enhancer in MMTV env Gene DISCUSSION We have identified an enhancer element in the MMTV env gene , META ( D+ ) , located between positions -325 to -350 relative to the start site of the transcript of the 3 ' LTR described earlier ( 8 , 9 ) .
Previously , the META fragment extending from -431 to -34 was shown to confer orientation-inde-pendent , induction-dependent , and CsA-suppressible activity in T helper lymphocytes ( 9 ) .
The existence of the META ( D+ ) element was suggested by DNase I footprinting analysis and confirmed by gel retardation assays and transient transfection studies .
Multimers of the META ( D+ ) element conferred activation-dependent , T lymphocyte-specific , and CsA-suppressible expression on the luciferase reporter gene in transient transfections .
The overall enhancer strength was related to the number of copies of the element , but did not require that the individual copies be oriented in the same direction ( Fig .
5 ) .
Two other putative control elements , META ( P ) and META ( D- ) , were indicated by DNase I footprinting analysis .
Data in Fig .
2 suggest that META ( D- ) may be a negative control region , since in almost every experiment a binding complex was found under non-transcribing conditions only ( either uninduced cells , or cells induced in the presence of CsA ) .
Of the several DNase I footprinting reactions carried out , there was only one instance where the protection with induced nuclear extracts occurred over the entire META ( D ) region ( this exception is shown in Fig .
24 ) .
The mobility shift experiments with META ( D- ) probe ( Fig .
3 ) are in agreement with its being a negative element ( i.e .
complexes were formed under non-transcribing conditions only ) .
Examination of the META ( D- ) sequence indicated a potential AP1 binding site , TGACcAA , in the -314 to -308 region ( 11 ) .
Similar to the closely spaced ( D+ ) and D ( - ) elements in META , the NF- « B ( -208 to -188 ) and AP1 ( -185 to -178 ) elements in the IL2 enhancer are also adjacent .
Footprinting analysis of the IL2 enhancer in vivo has revealed that the AP1 element is protected under uninduced conditions , whereas the NF- « B element is protected under conditions of induction ( 19 ) .
A negative role for the distal AP1 site in mouse IL2 upstream sequence has been suggested , since it showed diminished binding of nuclear factors from stimulated cells compared to the unstimulated ones ( 35 ) .
In contrast to the strong and reproducible footprints found for META ( D+ ) , the proximal site at META ( P ) was only weakly protected , and we do not know whether it has an enhancer function .
META ( D+ ) contains an inverted repeat overlapping the 5 ' end of the central binding region ( Fig .
7 ) .

negatively regulate expression of inducible genes ( 36 ) , including c-fos ( 37 ) and human B-interferon ( 38 ) .
The dyad symmetry element encompasses an AP2 motif ( 7/8 ) , but there was no evidence that it bound an inducible protein .
Given the similarities in the transcription regulatory properties of META and the IL2 upstream region ( 13 ) , it was reasonable to suppose that the META ( D+ ) element might be responding to the IL2-related NFAT binding factor ( s ) .
However , the human IL2 NFAT probe did not compete for META ( D+ ) in gel shift analysis .
A general hypothesis explaining the action of CsA has been proposed , which involves a complex of proteins recognizing NFAT plus one of several ancillary proteins such as AP1 , NF- « B , or Oct ( 39 , 40 ) .
The lysolecithin method we used in this paper to extract nuclear binding proteins utilizes 0.6 M KCI .
The more conventional methods depend on hypotonic shock and ammonium sulfate precipitation of nuclear proteins ( 13 , 22 ) .
NFAT binding is diminished if the salt concentration used for protein preparation or for binding reactions exceeds 0.3 M KCI ( 41 ) .
We found that META ( D+ ) probe also bound inducible nuclear factors obtained by conventional methods of extraction , and this binding was also not competed by NFAT oligonucleotide ( data not shown ) .
The human IL2 upstream region ( +45 to -362 ) did not compete for META ( D+ ) , nor did its constituent elements NF- « B ( Fig .
8 ) , NFAT , or AP1 ( data not shown ) .
The only strong competition for META ( D+ ) was by the SV40 AP3 element ( 33 ) , which encompasses an NF-KB site ( 42 ) and a site for NP-TCII , which is expressed constitutively in lymphocyte nuclei ( 82 ) .
However , META ( D+ ) differs from each of these factors in terms of its T helper lymphocyte specificity , its dependence on activation , and its CsA sensitivity , as well as lack of competition for binding .
8194 cells ( a B-cell line ) and Hela cells ( fibroblast ) are known to produce NF-kB and AP3 pro-teins , respectively , but META ( D+ ) did not promote transcriptional activity in these cells , either uninduced or exposed to PMA plus A23187 ( Fig .
6 ) .
In short , its properties can not be explained by interaction with known binding factors .
The nature of the META ( D+ ) binding factor remains uncertain , but it is reasonable to speculate that an NFATp/c family member is involved ( 43 ) , perhaps in conjunction with other components that differentiate it from the NF-AT binding factor of the human IL2 gene .
The mammary cell-specific expression of MMTV in mice is brought about by the net actions of positively acting estrogen-dependent elements and negative elements within the LTR .
The induction of T cell lymphomas by MMTV has been attributed to the loss of repressor elements in the control regions of the LTR due to deletions and/or rearrangements .
In particular , deletion of the repressor elements between -430 and -360 in the LTR promoted transcription of this viral strain in T cells ( 44 ) .
It is possible that the concerted action of the META ( D+ ) enhancer with known transcriptional regulatory sites in the LTR contributes to the induction of T cell lymphomas .
Enhancers of lymphotropic papova virus , Moloney murine leukemia virus , and T lymphomagenic virus SL3-3 also exhibit a high degree of homology to the AP3 binding site in the SV40 enhancer ( 45-47 ) .
These enhancers are involved in the generation of hematopoietic malignancies ( 47 ) , making META ( D+ ) a candidate enhancer for the observed MMTV-induced T cell lymphomas .
A tantalizing feature of META is that it regulates the expression , at least in certain T lymphoma cell lines , of the LTR transcript , which normally encodes the minor histocompatibility antigens of the Mls family ( 4 , 5 ) .
META , given its lymphoid-specific induction , makes an attractive candidate for the regulator of Mls antigen expression , except for one thing ; so far , we have seen expression only in T lymphocytes which , although implicated as Mls presenting cells in the induction of tolerance ( 48 ) , are not conventional antigen-presenting cells .
We have not observed META activity in B lymphocytes , but this may be because we have not yet looked at the correct B cells in the proper way .
