Speck Division of Tumor Virology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Pathology , Harvard Medical School , 44 Binney Street , Boston , MA 02115 Contributed by Jack L. Strominger , January 2 , 1991 ABSTRACT During latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection of human B lymphocytes , six viral nuclear antigens ( EBNAs ) are expressed from long primary transcripts by means of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylylation sites .
These transcripts initiate from one of two promoters , Cp or Wp , that function in a mutually exclusive fashion .
Wp is exclusively utilized during the initial stages of infection of primary B lymphocytes , followed by a switch to Cp usage .
These studies have been extended to show that ( ? )
a mutant EBV strain lacking the gene encoding EBNA 2 fails to switch from Wp to Cp usage in primary B lymphocytes , although the virus contains a functional Cp ; ( # ) a region from -429 to -245 base pairs upstream of Cp is essential for Cp activity in B lymphocytes , but only in the context of upstream and downstream sequences ; ( i ? )
this region contains an EBNA 2-dependent enhancer ; and ( iv ) DNase I protection employing nuclear extracts from B and T lymphocytes revealed a B-cell-specific footprint in the region of the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer .
These results support a model for viral promoter switching during the initial stages of infection in which Wp activity leads to the expression of EBNA 2 , followed by activation of Cp through the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a human lymphotopic herpes-virus that predominantly establishes a latent infection in B lymphocytes , with a concomitant growth transformation of the infected cells .
During viral latency , six EBV nuclear antigens ( EBNAs ) are known to be expressed , as well as three viral membrane antigens .
The viral genes encoding these antigens are spread over nearly two-thirds of the 172-kilobase ( kb ) viral genome .
However , transcription of these genes initiates from promoters that are clustered near the fused terminal repeats on the viral episome ( for review , see refs .
1-3 ) .
Two promoters have been identified ( Cp and Wp ) that are involved in driving transcription of the six EBNA genes , and they function in a mutually exclusive fashion ( 4 ) .
Infection of peripheral B lymphocytes with EBV leads initially to exclusive Wp usage , followed by up-regulation of Cp ( 5 ) .
In this paper the issue of the switch to Cp usage is addressed .

3942 described ( 7 ) .
The EBNA 2 expression vector employed in the cotransfection experiments , pEAAG6 , has been described ( 8 ) .
SVpCAT contains an enhancerless simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) early promoter and was described earlier ( 9 ) .
EBV sequences from -429 ( Avr II ) to -245 ( Sac I ) upstream of Cp were cloned in both orientations upstream of the SV40 promoter ( [ -429/-245 ] SVpCAT and [ -245/-429 ] SVp-CAT ) or downstream of the CAT gene ( SVpCAT [ -429/ -245 } ) .
In SVpCAT [ -340/-245 ] , a ( shorter ) 95-base-pair ( bp ) Kpn I/ Sac 1 fragment upstream of Cp was cloned into SVpCAT .
The C1ICAT plasmid series has been described ( 4 ) .
In Vitro Infection of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes , RNA Preparation , and S1 Nuclease Protection .
Virus was prepared from Akata cells ( an immortalizing strain of EBV ) ( 10 ) by induction with anti-IgG as described ( 5 ) .
Virus was prepared from the clone-13 cell line ( an EBV-positive , EBNA 2-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell line ) after induction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at 20 ng/ml for 10 days .
Infections were carried out as described ( 5 ) .
Total cellular RNA was prepared by the method of Auffray and Rougeon ( 11 ) .
Fifty micrograms of RNA was used in S1 nuclease protection analyses , employing specific oligonucleotides diagnostic for Cp or Wp activity ( 4 ) .
Cloning Cp .
EcoRI/Xho I restriction endonuclease-digested genomic DNA from the Cp-using lymphoblastoid cell line JY and from clone-13 was cloned into the Uni-ZAP XR vector ( Stratagene ) , and positive clones were recovered by screening the library with an oriP-containing probe .
DNA sequencing revealed a new Xho I site in the clone from clone-13 at position 13,143 ( with respect to the B95.8 map ) , just upstream of the BamHI C/W junction at 13,215 , resulting in a 5.8-kb insert containing only BamHI C sequences .
The Xho I site in the clone-13 clone was converted to a BamHI site , and the entire insert was used to replace the equivalent EcoRI/BamHI fragment in CWWiglobin ( see Fig .
3 ) , which resulted in the deletion of 72 bp from the BamHI C fragment .
Preparation of Extracts , in Vitro Transcription , and DNase I Footprinting .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described ( 12 ) with slight modifications ( 9 ) .
In some cases whole-cell extracts were prepared by omitting the crude nuclei preparation step .
DNase I footprinting and in vitro transcription were carried out as described ( 11 , 13 , 14 ) .
RESULTS An EBNA 2 Mutant EBV Strain Fails to Switch from Wp to Cp Usage in Primary B Lymphocytes .
Based on the kinetics of the switch from Wp to Cp and the appearance of the EBNAs , it seems likely that one or more of these viral antigens are either directly or indirectly involved in promoter switching ( 5 , 15 ) .
EBNA 2 and EBNA 4 appear to be the first viral Abbreviations : EBV , Epstein-Barr virus ; EBNA , EBV nuclear antigen ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; SV40 , simian virus 40 .

antigens expressed upon infection of primary B lymphocytes ( 15 ) .
To begin to address their possible roles in promoter switching , an infection time course was carried out by employing the nonimmortalizing clone-13 strain of EBV ( a subclone of the mutant P3HR-1 strain ) ( 16 ) .
This virus contains a deletion that removes the entire EBNA 2 gene and the exons encoding the carboxyl terminus of EBNA 4 ( 17 ) .
Infection of adult peripheral blood lymphocytes with clone-13 virus led to detectable Wp activity within 24 hr postinfection , which remained constant over the first 6 days ( Fig .
1B ) .
However , there was no detectable Cp activity over the same time range .
In contrast , infection of adult peripheral blood lymphocytes with the immortalizing Akata strain of EBV led to detectable Cp activity by 48 hr postinfection , and a pronounced down-regulation of Wp activity was observed by 96 hr postinfection with a concomitant rise in Cp activity ( Fig .
1A ) .
Clone-13 Virus Contains a Functional Cp .
Since the clone-13 Burkitt lymphoma cell line ( from which clone-13 virus was induced ) utilizes Wp exclusively ( 4 ) , the failure of clone-13 virus to switch to Cp usage upon infection of primary B lymphocytes may be due to the presence of a nonfunctional Cp in this strain of EBV .
To directly determine whether Cp is functional in the clone-13 genome , a 5.8-kb region of the genome containing Cp was cloned ( from the EcoRI site at 7316 bp to the Xho I site at 13,143 bp ) .
As a control , the same region was also cloned from the Cp-using lymphoblastoid cell line JY ( 18 ) ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Both the clone-13 and JY fragments were cloned into a reporter construct ( CWW1iglobin ; see Fig .
3 for structure ) in place of the cloned fragment isolated from the B95.8 cell line ( 5 , 19 ) .
These reporter plasmids were introduced back into the clone-13 cell line and the EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell line DG75 ( 20 ) , and Cp activity was assessed ( Fig .
1C ) .
In both cell lines , no difference in Cp activity was observed with the B95.8 , JY , and clone-13 reporter plasmids .
Thus , Cp from any of these viral strains introduced into the CWWiglobin reporter construct functions normally in cycling B lymphocytes ( i.e .
, in both clone-13 and DG75 cells ) .
The lack of Cp activity from the endogenous virus in the clone-13 cell line is therefore not the result of a nonfunctional Akata virus 24hr 48hr _ 96hr C1-mock inf 28hr 6 3 © S WOW1 3 9 ~ s 0 o input probe € # t protected | « k ’ % fragments Fig .

These results suggest that the failure to switch from Wp to Cp usage in primary cells infected with clone-13 virus is due to the absence of one or more of the EBNAs .
A Region Essential for Cp Activity Functions as an Enhancer in EBNA 2-Positive Cell Lines but Not in the EBNA 2-Negative Clone-13 Cell Line or in EBV-Negative Cell Lines .
To initially map cis-acting elements involved in regulating Cp activity , several deletions in the region upstream of Cp were gener-ated .
These deletion constructs were assayed in the EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell lines Jijoye ( which expresses EBNA 2 and is the parent of P3HR-1 and clone-13 ) ( 21 ) and clone-13 and in the EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell line DG75 ( Fig .
2 ) .
Deletion of a 1.2-kb region ( -2199 to -1021 bp upstream of Cp ) had no effect on Cp activity in any of the cell lines assayed ( see construct d1 , Fig .
2 ) .
However , deletion of a 776-bp region from -1021 to -245 bp abrogated Cp activity almost entirely ( see construct d2 , Fig .
2 ) .
A smaller deletion from -429 to -245 bp also had the same effect , mapping essential sequences to a 184-bp region ( see construct d6 , Fig .
2 ) .
Deletion of the sequences from -1021 to -429 bp ( see construct d5 , Fig .
2 ; data not shown ) did not affect Cp activity , indicating that the essential cis-acting elements map entirely within the region from -429 to -245 bp .
To determine whether this region functions as an enhancer , it was cloned in both orientations upstream of the enhancerless SV40 early promoter and transfected into various cell lines ( Table 1 ) .
In the EBNA 2-positive Jijoye cell line , the region from -429 to -245 bp exhibited enhancer activity in both orientations ( see experiments 1-3 , Table 1 ) .
However , in the EBNA 2-negative cell line clone-13 , this region did not function as an enhancer , but rather it significantly suppressed the activity of the SV40 early promoter .
Furthermore , in the EBV-negative cell line DG75 , this region also did not exhibit enhancer activity .
EBNA 2 Is Required for Enhancer Activity .
To determine whether EBNA 2 expression is required for enhancer func-tion , several cell lines were cotransfected with the appropriate reporter construct and either a control plasmid or an EBNA 2 expression plasmid .

Deletion of the sequences from -429 to -340 bp eliminated virtually all of the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer activity ( see experiments 6 and 9 , Table 1 ) .
EBNA 2-dependent enhancer activity was further substantiated by employing reporter constructs in which the region from -429 to -245 bp was in its physiological setting upstream of Cp and the CAT gene was linked to the C1 exon ( C1ICAT constructs ) .
In all cell lines examined , cotransfection of the EBNA 2 expression vector with the -820/C1CAT and -559/C1CAT constructs resulted in increased activity .
However , no apparent EBNA 2-dependent enhancer activity was observed with the -245/C1CAT plasmid .

2 , the region from -429 to -245 bp upstream of Cp is essential for Cp activity in both EBNA 2-positive and EBNA 2-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell lines in the context of upstream and downstream sequences .
However , when C1CAT constructs containing limited upstream and downstream sequences were assayed , deletion of this region ( in the absence of the EBNA 2 expression vector ) reduced activity only in the EBNA 2-positive cell line Jijoye ( see experiments 11 and 12 , Table 1 ) .
Indeed , deletion of these sequences resulted in increased activity in the clone-13 cell line , consistent with the observation that these sequences act as a suppressor in clone-13 cells in the absence of EBNA 2 ( compare experiments 1 and 2 and also 11 and 12 , Table 1 ) .
It is possible , however , that with the short C1CAT constructs the observed activity did not originate from Cp but rather from promoters associated with the plasmid .
To directly address this issue , transcription initiating from Cp was assessed by employing an in vitro transcription system with clone-13 and DG75 whole-cell extracts .
With both extracts , the initial observation that the region from -429 to -245 bp is essential for Cp activity , in the context of upstream and downstream sequences ( CW Wiglobin and CWW1d6globin ) , was reproduced in the in vitro transcription system ( Fig .
3 ) .
However , comparison of Cp activity exhibited by either -820/C1CAT or -559/C1CAT and -245/C1CAT in the in vitro system revealed that the -559 to -245 bp sequence is not required for Cp activity in these constructs .
Extending the upstream region to include oriP did not significantly alter the dependence of Cp activity on the d6 ( -429 to -245 bp ) region ( see oriP/C1 vs. oriP/C1d6 , Fig .
3 ) .
However , deletion of the sequences from -534 to -245 bp did appreciably diminish Cp activity in the context of extensive downstream sequences ( see -534/CWW1I vs. -245/ CWW1 , Fig .
3 ) , although this effect was small compared to the effect of deleting these sequences in the context of both upstream and downstream sequences ( see CWW1 vs. CWW1d6 , Fig .
3 ) .
Since the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer region is essential for Cp activity in the context of extensive upstream and downstream sequences , even in the absence of EBNA 2 , it was important to determine whether EBNA 2 expression influenced Cp activity in this setting .

- Influence of upstream and downstream sequences on the dependence of Cp on the EBNA 2 enhancer region .
The indicated reporter constructs were assayed by employing an in vitro transcription system with either DG75 or clone-13 whole-cell extracts .
RNA was recovered from the reactions , hybridized with a C1 exon-specific oligonucleotide probe , and digested with S1 nuclease .
The resulting products were resolved on a 10 % urea/acrylamide gel .
The filled arrowhead indicates total protection of the input probe , presumably resulting from transcription initiating upstream of Cp .
The open arrowhead indicates specific protection of transcripts initiating from Cp .
cells with CWY2CAT ( see wt in Fig .
2 for structure ) and either a control plasmid or an EBNA 2 expression vector revealed that there was little transactivation by EBNA 2 ( experiments 13 and 17 , Table 1 ) .
This observation was confirmed by S1 nuclease protection monitoring transcription initiating from Cp ( data not shown ) .
These data suggest that elements within the EBNA 2 enhancer interact with distal elements and that these interactions preclude further enhancement by EBNA 2 .
B Lymphocyte-Specific Transcription Factor Binding in the Region Containing the EBNA 2-Dependent Enhancer .
To identify regions binding transcription factors that may be important for EBNA 2-dependent enhancer activity , DNase I protection was carried out by employing nuclear extracts prepared from several lymphocyte cell lines ( Fig .
44 ) .
A large footprint extending from approximately -380 to -330 bp was observed with all B-lymphocyte extracts examined .
Protection of this region by extract prepared from the EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos indicates that it is not dependent on the presence of EBV antigens .
Notably , extracts prepared from the T-cell line Jurkat only protected a fraction of the extensive B-lymphocyte footprint ( Fig .
4B ) .
In addition , extracts prepared from the clone-13 cell line specifically protected the region from about -310 to -330 bp .
The latter result may be of some interest since in clone-13 cells the EBNA 2 enhancer acts as a suppressor in the absence of EBNA 2 , an effect not observed in the EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma cell line DG75 .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) 3945 result in a switch from Wp to Cp usage .
This failure to switch from Wp to Cp usage could not be attributed to a mutant Cp in the viral genome .
Furthermore , characterization of the region upstream of Cp identified a region that is essential for Cp activity in the context of upstream and downstream sequences and that contains an EBNA 2-dependent enhancer .
However , EBNA 2-responsive enhancer function could only be demonstrated in the absence of extensive upstream and downstream sequences .
Several important conclusions can be inferred from this data : ( ? )
since clone-13 virus fails to switch from Wp to Cp usage in primary B lymphocytes , expression of some of the EBNAs is required in these cells for Wp to Cp switching ; ( ii ) the preferential utilization of Cp over Wp in all Burkitt lymphoma cell lines examined ( both EBNA 2-positive and EBNA 2-negative ) indicates that in cycling B lymphocytes EBNA 2 is not required for Cp activity ; ( ii ? )
the inability of EBNA 2 to enhance Cp activity in the context of upstream and downstream sequences indicates that elements within the enhancer are involved in interactions with distal elements and that these interactions preclude further enhancement by EBNA 2 .
When the DNA sequence of the EBNA-dependent enhancer was compared to the EBV BamHI C and W sequences , two regions of striking homology were identified .
The B-cell-specific portion of the DNase I footprint contains the sequence 5-GAGTGCTATCTTTGGA-3 ' , which is ho-mologous to a region in oriP at -3927 to -3943 bp upstream of Cp ( 5-GAGTGCTATCcTTtGe-3 ' ) and to another region located downstream of Cp in the BamHI W fragment at position +2829 to +2844 bp ( 5'-tgcTGCTATCTTTaGA-3 ' ) .
Given the striking homology common to these three sequences it is likely that they bind the same factor ( s ) , which may be involved in a three-component interaction between the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer and distal elements , thus forming a tripartite regulatory structure that is essential for the activity of Cp .
The observation that Cp can not be transactivated by EBNA 2 in reporter constructs containing extensive upstream and downstream sequences raises the question of the significance of the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer and the role of EBNA 2 , if any , in promoter switching .
This , in turn , relates to the more fundamental question of the respective roles of Wp and Cp .
There are three obvious differences between Wp and Cp .
First , there are multiple copies of Wp , which may be important for generating sufficient transcription of EBNA 4 and EBNA 2 during the initial phase of infection .
Second , the 5 ' ends of Cp- and Wp-initiated transcripts are distinct , and this may influence the splicing of the long primary transcripts .
Finally , the 5 ' regulatory regions of Cp and Wp are different , and this may reflect a need to run these promoters in different activation and differentiation states of the infected cells .
While it appears certain that EBNAs 2 and 4 are expressed from Wp-initiated transcripts during the initial phase of infection , it is not known whether the other EBNAs are also expressed from Wp transcripts or whether switching to Cp is required before they can be expressed .
There is some evidence in support of a model in which expression of EBNAs 1 , 3a , 3b , and 3¢ requires switching to Cp usage .
It has been shown that infection of primary B lymphocytes with clone-16 virus ( both clone-13 and clone-16 are subclones of the P3HR-1 cell line ) leads to expression of EBNA 4 but not EBNAs 1 , 3a , 3b , or 3¢ ( 19 ) .
Furthermore , no EBNA 1 or 3 cDNA clones have been characterized that initiate from Wp in Wp-using cell lines , leaving unresolved the question of their origin .
In addition , a recent report demonstrated successful immortalization of human PBL s with clone-13 virus that had regained a functional EBNA 2 gene ( 22 ) .
Analysis of promoter usage in these cell cultures revealed Cp usage in 3946 Biochemistry : Woisetschlaeger et al .

addition to some Wp activity ( M.W .
and S.H.S .
, unpublished data ) .
If full expression of all the EBNAs requires switching from Wp to Cp usage , then the role of EBNA 2 and the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer may be during a discrete time period in the initial stages of infection prior to full transformation of the cells .
One possible point of action for EBNA 2 may be in the first G , phase of the cell cycle : It has been shown that infection of resting B lymphocytes with clone-13 virus activates the infected cells to progress into early G , phase of the cell cycle ( 23 ) .
The cells arrest at that point , however , and do not complete a full round of the cycle .
Thus , during the early stages of G1 , EBNA 2 expression may directly or indirectly up-regulate Cp via the Cp-associated EBNA 2-dependent enhancer .
This in turn may allow expression of the other EBNAs , some of which may be required to complete the cell cycle .
In contrast , in cycling B-cell lines , EBNA 2 is obviously not required for the activity of this enhancer but rather functions in cooperation with upstream and downstream elements .
