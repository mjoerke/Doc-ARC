CD40 signaling activates downstream effectors , including the tyrosine protein kinase , Lyn , the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI-3 kinase ) , and the transcription factor , NF- < B .
In this study , we demonstrate that stress-activated protein kinases ( SAPK ) are activated after CD40 cross-linking on various B cell lines or human tonsillar B cells .
The activation is rapid and transient and is mediated through a cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway .
Furthermore , this signaling pathway appears not to rely on protein kinase C. While CD40 ligation strongly activates the SAPKs ( up to 25-fold ) , it does not affect members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family ( MAPK ; ERK1 and ERK2 ) .
Consistent with these data , CD40 signals up-regulate c-jun but not c-fos mRNA and alter the transcription factor ATF2 but not the Raf-1 protein .
In summary , CD40 signaling preferentially induces SAPK but not MAPK .
Keywords : B cells/CD40/JNK/MAPK/SAPK Introduction CD40 is a 45-50 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein originally identified in B cells , some B cell malignancies and carcinoma cell lines ( Paulie et al .
, 1985 ; Clark and Ledbetter , 1986 ) .
In addition to B cells , CD40 has also been detected in other cell types , including follicular dendritic cells ( Schriever et al .
, 1989 ) , dendritic cells ( Hart and McKenzie , 1988 ) , activated macrophages ( Alderson et al .
, 1993 ) and thymic epithelial cells ( Galy and Spits , 1992 ) .
It is a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor superfamily ( Smith et al .
, 1994 ) .
The ligand for CD40 ( CD4O0L , also known as gp39 , T-BAM or TRAP ) is expressed on activated CD4¢* T cells ( Armitage er a/ .
, 1992 ) .
Contact-dependent signals mediated through CD40/CD4OL stimulate B cell survival , 92 growth and differentiation ( Noelle et a/ .
, 1992 ; Tsubata et al .
, 1993 ; Klaus et al .
, 1994b ; Parry et al .
, 1994 ) .
The key role of CD40 in the humoral immune response is evident from patients with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome ( HIM ) , where the cooperation between B and T cells has been disturbed due to a defective CD4O0L gene ( Hill and Chapel , 1993 ) .
These patients do not form germinal centers and do not switch from producing IgM to other Ig classes .
A similar phenotype has been found in mice with targeted disruption of either the CD40 ( Kawabe et al .
, 1994 ) or the CD40L ( Xu et al .
, 1994 ) gene .
CD40 plays a critical role in activation , proliferation and differentiation of B cells , including immediate early gene expression , cell adhesion , interleukin ( IL ) -6 secretion , B cell proliferation and survival , and Ig isotype production .
In addition , crosslinking CD40 promotes the survival of germinal center B cells and , in combination with IL-4 , supports long-term B cell proliferation ( see Banchereau et al .
, 1994 ; Clark and Ledbetter , 1994 ; Klaus er al .
, 1994a ) .
It may also function to regulate dendritic cells and dendritic cell-dependent HIV-1 expression ( Pinchuk et al .
, 1994 ) .
New protein tyrosine phosphorylation is induced very early after CD40 stimulation ( Uckun et al .
, 1991 ; Knox and Gordon , 1993 ; Faris et al .
, 1994 ; Ren et al .
, 1994 ) and is accompanied by an increase in Lyn protein tyrosine kinase activity and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( Pl-3 kinase ) activity ( Ren et al .
, 1994 ) .
We and others have found that CD40 ligation induces NF-KB ( Berberich et al .
, 1994 ; Francis et al .
, 1995 ) .
Recently , protein ( s ) that interact directly with the CD40 cytoplasmic tail ( called CD4O0bp , CRAFl and LAP1 ) have been described by several investigators ( Hu et al .
, 1994 ; Cheng et al .
, 1995 ; Mosialos et al .
, 1995 ) .
Although the exact function of CD40 receptor-associated factor , CRAFI , is not known , an essential role for this protein in CD40 signaling has been demonstrated in a B cell line expressing a truncated version of CRAFIL .
These cells no longer up-regulate .
CD23 , a low affinity Fc receptor for IgE , after signaling through CD40 ( Cheng et al .
, 1995 ) .
Whether this binding protein relays all signals to account for all phenotypic changes remains to be established .
Stress-activated protein kinases ( SAPK ; also known as JNK for c-Jun NH » -terminal kinase ) , form a group of serine-threonine protein kinases ( see Davis , 1994 ) related to the mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPK ; ERK 1 and ERK2 ) .
Different isoforms of these kinases-with molecular weights of 46 ( p46 ) or 54 kDa ( pS4 ) -have been cloned recently ( Dérijard et al .
, 1994 ; Kyriakis et al .
, 1994 ; Sluss et al .
, 1994 ) .
In this study , we refer to the p46 SAPKs as SAPKs .
Like ERK1 and ERK2 , they are activated through phosphorylation of both a threonine and tyrosine residue in a highly conserved tripeptide motif ( Dérijard et al .
, 1994 ) .

Cross-linking CD40 activates SAPK .

( EGF ) and nerve growth factor ( NGF ) ] are potent activa-tors of SAPKs ( Hibi et al .
, 1993 ; Bird et al .
, 1994 ; Dérijard et al .
, 1994 ; Kyriakis et al .
, 1994 ; Minden et al .
, 1994b ) .
Activation of SAPK probably involves Ras-dependent and Ras-independent pathways ( Minden et a/ .
, 1994a ) .
MEKK ( Yan et al .
, 1994 ) , a MAPK kinase kinase , seems to be a good candidate for transmitting the activation signal to SEK 1 , an immediate upstream regulator of SAPK ( Sanchez et al .
, 1994 ) .
The regulation of SAPK and MAPK can be both linked and executed separately .
While EGF activates both the SAPKs and MAPKs ( Minden et al .
, 1994a ) , TNF-a and UV radiation target SAPKs much more efficiently ( Kyriakis et al .
, 1994 ; Minden et al .
, 1994a ) .
The transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2 are the best characterized substrates for SAPK to date .
In both cases , two serines located proximal to the major transactivation domain become phosphorylated in response to SAPK agonists ( Hibi et al .
, 1993 ; Gupta et al .
, 1995 ) .
In the study reported here , we investigated whether CD40 signaling can modulate SAPK and/or MAPK activi-ties .
Our results indicate that cross-linking CD40 on B cells strongly activates SAPK but changes MAPK activity only marginally , if at all .
Results Cross-linking CD40 on B cells activates SAPK Initially , the effect of cross-linking CD40 on SAPK ( p46 , JNK 1 ) activity was examined in the human B cell lymphoma line , Daudi .
The activity of the SAPK after various stimuli was evaluated in immune complex kinase assays using a GST-c-Jun ( amino acids 5-89 ) fusion protein as substrate .
As shown in Figure 1A , cross-linking CD40 strongly activated SAPK , whereas treating the Daudi cells with several isotype-matched control anti-bodies-either binding ( anti-CD22 and anti-CD37 ) or non-binding ( anti-CD3 ) -did not influence the activity of SAPK compared with the medium control .
Next , we tested the substrate specificity of the anti-SAPK precipitates .
Whereas GST-c-Jun containing both the phosphorylation sites ( Ser63 and Ser73 ) and the d domain as binding domain for SAPK was phosphorylated , none of the other substrates tested was phosphorylated by the anti-SAPK precipitates ( Figure 1B ) .
Most importantly , a GST-c-Jun fusion protein containing both phosphorylation sites but lacking the 8 domain ( GST-c-Jun/nb ) , previously shown to be necessary for SAPK-dependent c-Jun phosphorylation ( Adler et al .
, 1992 ; Hibi et al .
, 1993 ; Dérijard et al .
, 1994 ) , and myelin basic protein ( MBP ; a substrate for ERK !
and ERK2 ) could not serve as substrates for SAPK precipitates in immune complex kinase assays ( Figure 1B ) .
Next , we determined the kinetics of SAPK activation after CD40 cross-linking on Daudi cells .
SAPK activity was increased 10- to 20-fold compared with unstimulated cells within 5 min after the onset of signaling through CD40 , reached its maximum ( > 20 fold ) after 10-15 min , and declined steadily thereafter ( Figure 2A-C ) .
Similar activation of SAPK was seen when soluble CD4O0L was used to ligate CD40 on Daudi cells ( data not shown ) .
The kinetics of activation were independent of the kinase assay used , i.e .
in vitro immune complex kinase assays and in vitro in-gel kinase assays gave comparable results 93 1.Berberich et a/ .

Cross-linking CD40 transiently activates SAPK in Daudi cells .
( A ) Daudi cells were treated with medium or anti-CD3 or anti-CD40 mAb ( 0.5 ug/ml ) .
The activities of the SAPKs were determined in an immune complex kinase assay using GST-c-Jun ( 2 ug ) as substrate .

( B ) Daudi cells were stimulated as in ( A ) .
SAPKs were precipitated from the lysates and tested for their activity in an in-gel kinase assay using GST-c-Jun as substrate ( 40 ug/ml ) .
In the control lane ( con . )
, 1/7 of each of the other lysates was combined , immunoprecipitated with anti-rac2 antisera ( * ) as control antisera and tested in parallel with the other samples .
Fold induction was assessed as in ( A ) .
Molecular weight standards are indicated in kDa .
( C ) Daudi cells were stimulated as in ( A ) .
SAPKs were precipitated from the cytoplasmic extracts and tested for their activity in immune complex kinase assays as in ( A ) ( panel a ) .
The nuclear extracts of the same cells were tested for induction of NF-xB binding activity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-KB binding site found in the promoter of invariant chain of MHC class II ( Pessara er al .
, 1990 ) ( panel b ) .
( Figure 2A and B ) .
The results of the in-gel kinase assays further support the specificity of the antiserum used because : ( i ) the molecular weight detected for SAPK correlates well with that published for SAPK ( 46 kDa ) ( Hibi et al .
, 1993 ; Dérijard et al .
, 1994 ; Kyriakis et al .
, 1994 ) ; ( ii ) only one dominant band emerged in the autoradiograph ( Figure 2B ) ; and ( iii ) an anti-rac2 antiserum used as a control gave no signal ( Figure 2B ) .
While anti-CD40 strongly activated p46 SAPK ( JNK 1 ) in Daudi cells , it only weakly and transiently activated p54 SAPK ( JNK2 ) ( data not shown ) .
Recently , we and others have shown that CD40 ligation activates the NF-KB system ( Berberich et al .
, 1994 ; Francis et al .
, 1995 ) .
Since it is conceivable that SAPK is involved in the induction of these transcription factors , we also analyzed the onset of SAPK relative to the activation of NF-KB after CD40 ligation .
SAPK slightly preceded the induction of NF-KB binding activity in Daudi cells ( Figure 2C ) .
We next tested whether SAPK activation after CD40 cross-linking could be generalized to other B cell sources .
Cross-linking CD40 was also sufficient to induce SAPK activity in the murine B cell lymphoma M12 ( Figure 3A ) and the murine immature B cell , WEHI 231 ( Figure 3B ) .
As in Daudi cells , the activation of the p54 SAPK ( JINK2 ) isoform was weak and very transient ( data not shown ) .
In addition , in a variant of M12 stably transfected with human CD40 ( M12/CD40 ) , both human and murine CD40 molecules initiated SAPK activation , indicating that the CD40-SAPK signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved ( Figure 3A ) .
The B cell lines tested varied in the strength of 94 SAPK activity induced through CD40 ; for example , CD40 ligation produced only 2-fold induction of SAPK activity in DND39 and CESS cell lines ( data not shown ) .
We also examined human tonsillar B cells for their responsiveness to CD40 signaling .
Unlike the B cell lines tested , which gave highly reproducible results , the freshly isolated human tonsillar B cells yielded results that varied from donor to donor .
In ~50 % of all experiments , crosslinking CD40 alone was sufficient to activate SAPK .
In most of these experiments , the activation was 2- to 4-fold but ranged as high as 12-fold over the medium controls ( Figure 3C and data not shown ) .
In other experiments , cross-linking CD40 was not sufficient to stimulate SAPK activity in untreated cells ( Figure 3D ) .
This suggested that the state of activation of the B cells might influence their response to CD40 ligation and the degree of SAPK activation .
To test this possibility , we kept tonsillar cells in medium or pre-treated them with a low dose of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) for 12 h before isolating the B cells .
Pre-treatment with PMA consistently made tonsillar B cells more responsive to CD40-mediated SAPK activation ( Figure 3D ) .
CD40 signaling preferentially targets SAPK compared with ERK1 and ERK2 Next , we asked whether CD40 ligation could also activate the related protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 , initially using the Daudi B cell line .
Under conditions in which CD40 ligation clearly activated SAPK , the activity of ERK1 and ERK2 was not changed as measured by the Cross-linking CD40 activates SAPK Fig .

Cross-linking CD40 activates SAPK in murine B cell lines and human tonsillar B cells .
( A-C ) The murine B cell lymphoma M12 ( wild-type , M12 ) or a clone stably transfected with human CD40 ( M12/CDA40 ) ( A ) , the murine immature B cell line WEHI 231 ( B ) and human tonsillar B cells ( C ) were stimulated for 15 min as indicated .

Thereafter , the B cell population was enriched as described , stimulated as indicated and tested for SAPK activity as described in Figure 1A .
The figure shows one of four representative experiments .
phosphorylation of MBP in an immune complex kinase assay ( Figure 4A ) .
The lack of CD4O0-dependent ERK 1 and ERK2 activation was not due to the absence of these enzymes from Daudi cells , since activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) by PMA and the calcium ionophore ionomycin did activate both ERK1 and ERK2 .
Kinetic analyses also revealed that ERK2 was not activated at earlier or later time points , up to 90 min after CD40 ligation ( Figure 4B ) .
ERK1 activity paralleled ERK2 activity in those cells but was not as strong ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , no significant change in the activity of ERK1 and ERK2 was detected in the murine M12/ CD40 and WEHI 231 cell lines ( data not shown ) .
To test whether CD40 signaling might activate ERK 1 and ERK2 at even later time points , we used a transient expression assay based on a reporter plasmid , 5X SRE-FOS-CAT/wt , which contains five copies of the serum response element ( SRE ) ( Lee and Gilman , 1994 ) placed adjacent to a basic c-fos promoter and linked to CAT ( chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ) .
The SREs from the c-fos promoter bind the transcription factor p62 `` ( in a ternary complex with SRE ) , which , on phosphorylation by ERK !
and ERK2 , can initiate transcription of the reporter gene ( Gille et al .
, 1992 ; Marais et al .
, 1993 ) .
Daudi cells were transfected with the relevant reporter constructs and stimulated with either anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) or a combination of PMA and ionomycin during the last 16 h of the transfection assay .
Owing to the high stability of the CAT enzyme , this assay should pick up and integrate any change in ERK1 and ERK2 activity during the whole period of stimulation .
While PMA in combination with ionomycin strongly induced SRE-dependent gene expression , cross-linking CD40 induced little or no expression ( Figure 5A and data not shown ) .
The inability of the CD40 signal to induce TPA-response element ( TRE ) -dependent gene expression is most likely due to the lack of Fos and/or to the fact that phosphorylation of Jun by p46 SAPK alone is insufficient to activate the TRE .
Again , transfection experiments with M12/CD40 cells yielded essentially the same results ( data not shown ) .
Further support for the notion that CD40 signaling activates SAPK more efficiently than ERK1 and ERK2 came from the analyses of endogenous mRNA expression .
While PMA and ionomycin increased both c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels in Daudi cells within 1 h after stimulation , CD40 stimulation augmented only c-jun mRNA expression ( Figure 5B ) .
The inability of CD40 ligation to activate increases in c-fos mRNA is consistent with the inability of CD40 ligation to activate MAPK since , if CD40 ligation could stimulate ERK 1 and ERK2 activity , the SRE in the c-fos promoter should also be activated .
Even in the presence of cycloheximide , which superinduces the expression of early response genes , no c-fos mRNA could be detected after signaling through CD40 .
Together , these data indicate that cross-linking CD40 activates SAPK but not MAPK in the B cell lines examined .
CD40-induced SAPK activation is not blocked by pre-treating B cells with high doses of phorbol ester or cyclosporin A The data thus far suggested that PKC was probably not involved in the CD4O0-dependent SAPK activation , since 95 1.Berberich et al .

induction of PKC normally activates ERK1 and ERK2 via Raf-1 ( Kolch et al .
, 1993 ) .
To test whether PKC is required for CD40 activation of SAPK , we pre-treated M12/CD40 cells with high doses of PMA ( 0.3 ug/ml ) for 16 h to deplete PKC levels .
PMA pre-treatment totally abrogated - PKC-dependent - PMA/ionomycin-induced SAPK and ERK2 activity at 10 and 60 min after stimulation but left CD4O0-stimulated SAPK activity untouched ( Figure 6A ) .
The same result was obtained when PKC-depleted Daudi cells were used ( data not shown ) .
Thus , PKC 96 apparently is not required for the CD40 signaling pathway leading to SAPK activation .
Because SAPK activated by ligation of both CD3 and CD28 receptors on T cells has been shown to be sensitive to cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , we examined whether CD40-induced SAPK in Daudi cells was influenced by CsA .
While CsA strongly suppressed the induction of SAPK by PMA and ionomycin , it had no effect on CD40-induced SAPK 15 min ( Figure 6B ) or 30 min ( data not shown ) post-stimulation .
Furthermore , the CD40-SAPK pathway was also insensitive to CsA in murine M12/CD40 cells ( data not shown ) .
Cross-linking CD40 changes the electrophoretic mobility of ATF2 but not of Raf-1 It has been reported that ATF2 is phosphorylated by activated SAPK and that phosphorylation of ATF2 correlates with a shift in ATF2 mobility in SDS-PAGE ( Gupta et al .
, 1995 ) .
Consistent with those results , we found that the electrophoretic mobility of ATF2 in Daudi cells was also altered after cross-linking CD40 , and this change in mobility paralleled the activation of SAPK ( Figure 7a and b ) .
We also performed an analogous experiment for Raf-1 .
In contrast to ATF2 , Raf-1 mobility was influenced not by CD40 signaling but by PMA and ionomycin ( Figure 7¢ ) .
These results suggest that CD4O0-induced SAPK may phosphorylate and thereby activate ATF2 , implying that this transcription factor may function as a downstream mediator of CD40 signaling .
In addition , these data indicate that the CD40 pathway does not involve Raf-1 activation .
Discussion In this study , we evaluated whether cross-linking CD40 on B cell lines and human tonsillar B cells activates SAPKs and MAPKs ( ERK and ERK2 ) .
Our results clearly demonstrate that signaling through CD40 can up-regulate the activity of SAPK while affecting ERK1 and ERK2 activity only marginally , if at all .
Several lines of evidence indicate that ERK 1 and ERK2 are not significantly activated by CD40 : ( i ) no significant phosphorylation of MBP was detected with anti-ERK 1 and ERK2 precipitates in in vitro kinase assays after CD40 cross-linking for various lengths of time ; ( ii ) no significant SRE-dependent reporter gene expression was detected after CD40 ligation , which should pick up any ERK1 and ERK2 activity via an activated p62 `` C `` ( Gille et al .
, 1992 ; Marais et al .
, 1993 ) ; and ( iii ) no endogenous c-fos mRNA was expressed after CD40 signaling .
However , the CD4O0-induced SAPK response could be quite strong , with 15- to 25-fold increases in activity in Daudi cells .
The activity peaked at ~10-15 min after the engagement of CD40 and declined thereafter , but persisted for several hours .
Although p46 SAPK is preferentially activated compared with p54 SAPK and the ERK1/2 kinases in the B cells we have studied , it is possible that in other cell types or stages ligating CD40 may produce a different pattern of p46/p54 SAPK and/or ERK1/2 activation .
For example , Rafiee et al .
( 1995 ) recently found that TNF- @ , which preferentially induces SAPK activation in a number of cell types ( Kyriakis et al .
, 1994 ) , did activate ERK in human neutrophils .
SAPK apparently may be activated via either Ras- P90 oo0e eee # # Cross-linking CD40 activates SAPK Fig .

CD40-dependent activation of SAPK is not blocked by pre-treating M12/CD40 cells with high doses of PMA or by the inhibitor cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .
( A ) M12/CD40 cells were cultured in medium alone ( a ) or with PMA ( 300 ng/ml ) ( b ) for 16 h. Cells were then stimulated as indicated [ anti-CD40 , 0.5 ug/ml ; PMA ( P ) , 50 ng/ml ; and ionomycin ( 1 ) 0.25 ug/ml ] .

dependent or Ras-independent pathways ( Bird et al .
, 1994 ; Minden et al .
, 1994a ) .
We have no direct data supporting one pathway or the other , but two findings argue in favor of the Ras-independent pathway .
First , cross-linking CD40 does not lead to the changes in Raf-1 mobility ( Figure 7¢ ) that one might expect after activation .
Second , the related TNF-a receptors ( TNF-oRs ) and CD40 share a number of highly conserved features : all three surface molecules belong to the same protein family ( Smith et al .
, 1994 ) ; CD40 and TNF-ouR p75 bind highly homologous proteins with their cytoplasmic tail-TRAF2 for the TNF- « R p75 ( Rothe et al .
, 1994 ) and CRAFl for CD40 ( Hu et al .
, 1994 ; Cheng et al .
, 1995 ; Mosialos et al .
, 1995 ) ; both CD40 and TNF-aR p55 activate NF-KB ( Kruppa et al .
, 1992 ; Berberich et al .
, 1994 ) ; and CD40 and the TNF-aR ( s ) , p55 and/or p75 , both target SAPK ( Figures 1-4 ; see also Kyriakis et al .
, 1994 ; Minden et al .
, 19942 ) , with the TNF-auR ( s ) acting in a Ras-independent way .
Thus , it is likely that CD40 may signal in a similar manner .
Cross-linking CD40 leads to c-jun mRNA expression in Daudi cells ( Figure 5B ) .
There was a good correlation between the strength of SAPK activity and the amount of c-jun mRNA expressed .
Nevertheless , it is not yet clear whether the transcription factors known to be effectors of SAPK , i.e .
c-Jun ( Hibi et al .
, 1993 ) and ATF2 ( Gupta et al .
, 1995 ) , are in fact responsible and sufficient to 97 Fig .

Cross-linking CD40 changes the electrophoretic mobility of ATF2 but not of Raf-1 .
Daudi cells were stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb ( 0.5 ug/ml ) or a combination of PMA ( P , 50 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( I , 0.25 ug/m ! )
for the times indicated .
Extracts were then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antisera directed against ATF2 or Raf-1 .
Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting ( b and ¢ ) .
SAPK activity of the cells was monitored by means of an immune complex kinase assay ( a ) .
account for the up-regulation of the c-jun promoter .
After CD40 cross-linking , c-fos mRNA was not detectable ( Figure 5B ) and a reporter gene dependent on the classical AP-1 ( Jun/Fos ) heterodimer was not expressed significantly ( Figure 5A ; see also Berberich et al .
, 1994 ) .
Thus , it seems unlikely that AP-1 , a potent regulator of the c-jun promoter ( Angel et al .
, 1988 ) , contributes to the increase in c-jun mRNA found after CD40 cross-linking .
Jun2/ TRE is another regulatory site in the 5 region of the c-jun gene .
It has been shown to bind ATF2/c-Jun hetero-dimers ( van Dam et al .
, 1993 ) and to exert a regulatory function in ATF2-dependent c-jur promoter activity ( Livingstone et al .
1995 ; van Dam et al .
, 1995 ) .
Since CD40 ligation induces a migrating shift in ATF2 ( Figure 7b ) , and ATF2 contains a phosphorylation-dependent transcription activation domain ( Livingstone et al .
, 1995 ; van Dam et al .
, 1995 ) , Jun2/TRE seems a likely target site for SAPK-dependent c-jun up-regulation .
Recently , Francis et al .
( 1995 ) found some increase in the TRE ( AP-1 site ) binding activity after cross-linking CD40 on primary murine B cells .
Thus , as yet uncharacterized TRE site binding activity may influence transcripitional activity of the c-jun gene .
Further transcripton factors could also be involved in CD4O0-dependent c-jun expression .
NF-KB could be a potential candidate because : ( i ) it is strongly induced by CD40 signals ( Berberich et al .
, 1994 ) ; ( ii ) NF-KB and ATF2 have been shown to interact in vitro ( Du et al .
, 1993 ) ; and ( iii ) DNA sequences differing in only one residue from an NF-xB consensus site are located in the c-jun promoter region close to the ATF2 binding site ( D.Morris , personal communication ) .
Consistent with data published by Gille et al .
( 1995 ) , c-fos mRNA expression in B cells correlates with ERK 98 activity ( Figure 5B and data not shown ) .
So far , we have been unable to definitely exclude the involvement of SAPK and thus a dual signal requirement for c-fos mRNA expression due to the lack of a stimulus which exclusively activates ERK in our system .
However , we have compared anti-IgM with anti-IgM/anti-CD40 stimulation in WEHI 231 cells and analyzed them with respect to SAPK and ERK activation and c-fos mRNA expression .
Both stimuli induced identical ERK activation and c-fos mRNA expression , even though there was a dramatically higher SAPK activation in doubly stimulated cells ( Siebelt et al .
, 1995 ) .
Thus , at least the level of SAPK activity did not influence ERK-dependent c-fos mRNA expression .
The ERK dependency of c-fos expression was demonstrated by stimulating the cells with anti-CD40 alone , which again led to strong SAPK induction-comparable with doubly stimulated cells-but neither ERK activation nor c-fos mRNA expression ( Siebelt et al .
, 1995 ) .
CD40 signals lead to changes in a variety of downstream signal transducers including protein tyrosine kinases ( Faris et al .
, 1994 ) , the PI-3 kinase ( Ren et al .
, 1994 ) , the SAPK ( Figures 1-4 ) and the transcription factors NF- « B ( Berberich et al .
, 1994 ; Francis et al .
, 1995 ) and NF-AT ; for the latter a co-stimulatory signal may be necessary ( Choi et al .
, 1994 ; Francis et al .
, 1995 ) .
Intriguingly , in Daudi cells , the onsets of activation of NF-KB and SAPK after CD40 cross-linking are basically parallel ( Figure 2C ) .
On the basis of this coordinated action , it is possible that the SAPK lies upstream on a pathway leading to phosphorylation of IxB ( -a and/or -B ) and subsequently to activation of NF-KB , or that SAPK per se is the kinase that phosphorylates IxB ( s ) .
However , we have not detected phosphorylation of IKB- @ with activated SAPK ( unpub-lished observation ) .
Furthermore , pre-treatment of Daudi cells with the anti-oxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate totally inhibits CD40-induced NF-KB activation ( Berberich et al .
, 1994 ) but , at the same doses , activates the SAPK by itself ( data not shown ) .
Thus , our data at this juncture favor a model in which SAPK and NF- « B are located on parallel pathways .
In contrast to Daudi , M12 and WEHI 231 cells , another human B cell line , B104 ( Ishigami et al .
, 1992 ) , showed no increase in SAPK activity after CD40 cross-linking , even though SAPK was present and activatable by phorbol ester and ionomycin in these cells ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , freshly isolated human tonsillar B cell preparations varied in their response to CD40 ; responsiveness to CD40 ligation may depend on the maturation or activation stage of B cells , i.e .
the CD40-SAPK linkage may not exist ( physically or functionally ) at every B cell stage .
Pre-activation of tonsillar B cells with PMA induced otherwise unresponsive B cells to be sensitive to CD40-dependent SAPK activation .
Pre-treating tonsillar B cells with either heterologous F ( ab ' ) , anti-IgM antisera or IL-4 had the same effect ( data not shown ) .
This model is supported further by our preliminary data that buoyant human tonsillar B cells are more responsive to CD40-dependent SAPK activation than dense cells .
To define how activation signals make normal B cells more responsive to CD40-induced SAPK activation will require further study .
For now we can speculate that a component of the CD40-SAPK pathway may be missing at certain activation stages of B cell maturation , or that the pathway is inhibited .
We proposed previously that CD40 on antigen-presenting cells and CD28 on T cells have similar signaling properties and can activate each other 's pathways in a reciprocal dialog ( Clark and Ledbetter , 1994 ) .
Here we found additional similarities in these pathways : CD40 ( Figure 5B ) and CD28 ligation ( Chatta et al .
, 1994 ) both activate increases in c-jun and not c-fos mRNA , and both CD40 ( Figures 1-4 ) and CD28 ( Su et al.. , 1994 ) are involved in SAPK activation .
In addition , similar to CD40 on certain human tonsillar B cells , ligation of CD28 by itself is not sufficient to activate SAPK in the T cells analyzed so far but depends on simultaneous T cell receptor ( TCR ) signals ( Su et al .
, 1994 ) .
However , in contrast to B cells .
no situation has been described for T cells in which CD28 ligaton by itself could stimulate SAPK .
Also , unlike in T cells , in WEHI 231 cells the engagement of the antigen receptor is sufficient for SAPK activation ( Siebelt et al .
, 1995 ) .
In addition .
CD4O0-dependent activation of SAPK seems to be insensitive to CsA ( Figure 6B ) .
whereas the combination of TCR/CD28 ligation leading to SAPK activation is sensitive to this drug ( Su et al .
, 1994 ) .
The data .
however .
are not yet sufficient to determine whether the differences we observe for SAPK recruitment in B and T cells reflect differences in T versus B cells or are due to distinct requirements for induction of SAPK at specific activation/maturation stages .
The finding that CD40 and the BCR are not always strong inducers of SAPK by themselves and can cooperate in certain B cells supports the latter notion .
