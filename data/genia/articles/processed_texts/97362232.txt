The Cytoplasmic Domain of Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) Receptor a Subunit Is Essential for Both GM-CSF-mediated Growth and Differentiation* ( Received for publication , January 28 , 1997 , and in revised from , May 19 , 1997 ) Tetsuya Matsuguchi $ # $ § , Yanming Zhao1 , Michael B.

Kraft $ # ** From the { Division of Medical Oncology , University of Colorado Health Science Center , Denver , Colorado 80262 , the Department of Biochemistry , University of Kentucky , Lexington , Kentucky 40536-0084 , and the |Division of Medical Oncology , University of Washington and Veterans Administration Medical Center , Seattle , Washington 98108 Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) regulates differentiation , survival , and proliferation of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells .
The biologic actions of GM-CSF are mediated by binding to a specific receptor consisting of two chains designated as « and B subunits .
We have demonstrated that the murine FDC-P1-derived cell line WT-19 transfected with the human GM-CSF receptor a and B subunits ( GM-CSFRa and $ ) can be induced to differentiate by the addition of human GM-CSF ( hGM-CSF ) .
By expressing a series of GM-CSFRa mutants in WT19 cells , we have determined the amino acid domains of the GM-CSFRa cytoplasmic domain that regulate cell differentiation , proliferation , and survival .
We found that the membrane proximal proline-rich domain and adjacent 16 residues are essential for both hGM-CSF-dependent cell proliferation and differentiation .
In contrast , the C-terminal region of the GM-CSFRa cytoplasmic domain was not necessary for cell differentiation mediated by hGM-CSF , but the removal of this region severely impaired the ability of hGM-CSF to support cell survival .
While the activation of JAK2 , She , Erk , and STATS proteins correlated with hGM-CSF-mediated cell growth , cellular differentiation occurred in the absence of activation of these signal transduction pathways .
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is a 22-kDa glycoprotein , which is secreted by activated T cells , endothelial cells , fibroblasts , mast cells , B cells , and macrophages ( 1-4 ) .
GM-CSF plays an important role in promoting differentiation , survival , and proliferation of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells as well as enhancing the function of mature neutrophils , monocytes , * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grants DKA44741 ( to A.

GM-CSF causes a major cytoskeletal reorganization in plasma cells and hairy cells , resulting in the inhibition of motility and loss of adhesion to cellular and matrix ligands ( 9 ) .
The biologic actions of GM-CSF are mediated by binding to a specific receptor consisting of a and B subunits , both of which are members of the type-I cytokine receptor family ( 10 , 11 ) .
The a subunit binds GM-CSF with low affinity ( 10 ) .
A soluble form of human GM-CSF receptor « subunit ( GM-CSFRa ) has also been identified , whose function in vivo is unclear ( 12 , 13 ) .
While the subunit does not bind GM-CSF by itself , it forms a high affinity receptor in combination with the a subunit ( 11 ) .
The B chain is called the common $ chain ( Bc ) because it is shared by interleukin 3 ( IL3 ) and interleukin 5 ( IL5 ) receptors ( 14 , 15 ) .
Although the cytoplasmic domain of GM-CSFRa is only 54 amino acids , we and others have demonstrated that the GM-CSFRa cytoplasmic domain is necessary for GM-CSF-induced cell proliferation ( 16-18 ) .
Several studies showed that the cytoplasmic domain of the human GM-CSF receptor B chain ( GM-CSFR $ ) is also essential for the mitogenic signal ( 18 , 19 ) .
However , because of the lack of adequate biologic model cell systems , the role of GM-CSFR a and $ subunits in GM-CSF-induced cell differentiation has not been clearly demonstrated .
The present study defines the role of GM-CSFRa in GM-CSF-mediated differentiation by studying WT19 cells , an FDC-Pl-derived cell line that uniformly differentiates toward the monocytic lineage in response to murine GM-CSF ( mGM-CSF ) , but grows and does not differentiate in the presence of murine IL3 ( mIL3 ) ( 20 , 21 ) .
We find that when the wild type human GM-CSFR a and B subunits are both transfected into WT19 cells , these cells respond to the addition of human GM-CSF ( hGM-CSF ) by undergoing differentiation .
To identify the residues of GM-CSFRa cytoplasmic domain necessary for the induction of cell differentiation , WT1Q cell lines were established which express mutated cytoplasmic domains of the a subunit along with the wild type B subunit .
The ability of GM-CSF to support cell survival of WTI9 correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 , STAT5 , She , and extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( ERKs ) .
However , the induction of differentiation in the cells containing the 18-amino acid deletion of the C-terminal region occurred without the detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of these four signaling molecules .
Our results suggest that cell survival and differentiation are controlled by different signal transduction pathways regulated by varying portions of the GM-CSFRae .

RESULTS maM-CSF Induces Rapid Monocytic Differentiation of WT19 Cells Which Is Reversible after Removal of the Factor-WTIQ cells ( 20 ) growing in mIL-3 demonstrated a myeloblastic morphology including rounded nuclei , fine chromatin , and thin and basophilic cytoplasm .
In response to mGM-CSF , the cells demonstrated monocytic characteristics : an indented nucleus with fine-stranded appearance , increased cytoplasm containing a variable number of vacuoles , and larger total cell size .
Cells treated with mGM-CSF also became positive for nonspecific esterase and acid phosphatase ( Table I ) .
To quantitate the number of cells undergoing differentiation after the addition of mGM-CSF or mIL3 , surface marker changes were evaluated by FACS analysis .
WTIQ cells growing in mIL3 showed weak surface expression of F4/80 and Mac3 ( Fig .
14 ) , both of which are monocytic specific markers ( 23-25 ) .
When the WTIQ cells were incubated with mGM-CSF , the expression of both these markers was significantly increased , suggesting that the cells 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 17452 A 250 mil.3 miL3 - > mGM day3 woo mil3 - > m6M day14 miL3 miL3 - > mGM day3 « -.- _ miL3 ~ > » mGM day14 ase -- -- - NC miL 3 « -- - mil3 ~ > mGM day3 -~ - mL3 - > ml day14 a To tom T =T 19® 1a } 102 102 F4/8B0 asa .

1. mGM-CSF induced rapid , reversible monocytic differentiation of WT1Q cells .
A and B , WT19 cells were washed with factor-free medium and then were placed in medium containing either 10 ng/ml mIL3 or mGM-CSF .
Forward ( FSC ) and side scatter ( SSC ) parameters of the cells were examined by flow cytometry .
The cell surface expression of monocyte specific F4/80 and Mac3 was examined by flow cytometry after staining with the appropriate monoclonal and fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -labeled secondary antibodies .
The control WT1Q cells were stained with the secondary antibody alone .
C , WT19 cells maintained in medium containing 10 ng/ml mGM-CSF were washed in factor-free medium and switched to medium containing mIL3 for the indicated number of days .
F4/80 expression was analyzed by FACS analysis .
differentiated toward monocytic lineage ( Fig .
14 ) .
As demonstrated by FACS analysis , cell size and granularity also increased as evidenced by an increase in both forward scattergram ( FSC ) and side scattergram ( SSC ) ( Fig .
1A ) .
These characteristics were stable for at least 14 days ( Fig .
14 ) .
Differentiated cells continued to divide , and the cell number in-creased .
Increases in both F4/80 expression and cell granularity were evident within 1-2 days after the addition of mGM-CSF ( Fig .
1B ) .
Washing out the mGM-CSF and replacing it with mIL3 caused the F4/80 expression to decrease to background levels within 3 days ( Fig .
1C ) , suggesting that mGM-CSF-induced monocyte/macrophage differentiation of WTI1Q cells is a reversible phenomenon .
In addition , mGM-CSF induced cell differentiation of WTI19 in the presence of mIL3 , suggesting mGM-CSF-mediated differentiation signal is dominant over mIL3 ( data not shown ) .
hGM-CSF -induced Differentiation of WT19 Cells Transfected with Human GM-CSF Receptors-To examine the ability of hGM-CSF to mediate the differentiation of WTIQ cells , cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding human GM-CSFR B subunit containing a hygromycin resistance se-lectable marker .
A clone expressing high levels of GM-CSFR $ , WT19 $ clone 1 , was then transfected with the G418-selectable expression plasmid encoding GM-CSFRa wild type subunit , and the cells were further selected in G418 .
Treatment of these doubly transfected cells with hGM-CSF induced differentiation of WT19 cells as measured by changes in F4/80 and Mac3 surface markers ( Fig .
2 ) .
This hGM-CSF-induce differentiation was also found to be reversible upon removal of human hGM-CSF ( data not shown ) .
Expression of Human GM-CSFRa « a Mutants in WTI9 Cells-We have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of the a subunit regulates growth of factor-dependent hematopoietic cells ( 16 , 17 ) .
Specific residues of the a subunit are highly conserved among growth factor receptors ( Fig .
3B ) .
As hGM-CSF is capable of inducing the differentiation of WTLQ cells , it is possible to evaluate the role of the cytoplasmic domain in GM-CSF-mediated cell growth , survival , and differentiation .
A series of expression plasmids encoding deletion and substitution mutants of GM-CSFRa ( Fig .

Surface expression of monocyte-specific antigens in WT1Q clones treated with hGM-CSF .
WTI clones were maintained in mIL3 alone or mIL8 + 10 ng/ml hGM-CSF for 3 days .
The cell surface expression of monocytic-specific F4/80 ( A ) and Mac3 ( B ) were analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with the respective monoclonal antibodies and FITC-labeled secondary antibodies .
lacks the entire cytoplasmic domain except for the membrane-proximal 5 amino acids ; dell has an internal deletion of 15 amino acid residues corresponding to the proline-rich box 1 region , which is well conserved among the type I cytokine receptor family ; del2 has an internal 16-amino acid deletion adjacent to the box 1 region ; del3 has an 8-amino acid deletion within the box 1 region removing the proline-rich domain ( PPVP ) ( Fig .
3B ) ; ter3 has a deletion of the C-terminal 18 amino acid residues ; and three individual amino acid substitutions have mutations in the well conserved proline-rich do-main : proline 357 , 358 , or 360 ( Fig .
3A ) .
These GM-CSFRa expression plasmids were transfected into WT19 B clone 1 , and the G418-resistant clones were isolated .
The levels of expression of these mutants were analyzed by staining with a specific anti-GM-CSFRa monoclonal antibody followed by flow cytometric analysis with a FACScan ( Fig .
4 ) .
All these mutants were confirmed to express Bc equally well by immunoblotting using specific anti-GM-CSFRB antibody ( data not shown ) .
Each transfectant was examined for hGM-CSF binding using *'* `` I-labeled hGM-CSF , and the results of high affinity binding profiles were shown in Table II .
All mutant transfectants including terl clones bind hGM-CSF with high affinity and K , , values suggesting that there are equivalent numbers of receptors with similar affinity .
These results sug- gested that the mutations introduced in the cytoplasmic domain of GM-CSFRa did not affect the interactions of GM-CSFRa with the ligand or Multiple Domains of GM-CSFRa Are Necessary for GM-CSF induced Protein-tyrosine Phosphorylation of p52Shc , ERKs , JAK2 , and STAT5-It is well established that tyrosine phosphorylation of an array of cytoplasmic proteins is critical for cytokine signal transduction .
Accordingly , we analyzed the spectrum of substrates tyrosine-phosphorylated by addition of hGM-CSF to WTI9 cells expressing various GM-CSFRa mutants .
Several hematopoietic cytokines including GM-CSF induce p52 She tyrosine phosphorylation , which correlates with their ability to activate Ras ( 26-30 ) .
GM-CSFRa transfectants were assayed for hGM-CSF -induced She tyrosine phosphorylation by anti-She immunoprecipitation followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting .
As shown in Fig .
5A , increased p52 She tyrosine phosphorylation was detected only in wild type and P357G GM-CSFR a transfectants but not in the other mutants .
Activated Ras through a cascade of protein kinases stimulates phosphorylation of ERKs ( 31 ) .
hGM-CSF induced phosphorylation of both p44ERK1 and p42ERK2 in wild type and P357G cells , but not in any other transfectants ( data not shown ) .

Tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT5 was induced by GM-CSF in wild type and P357G mutants ( Fig .
5 , B and C ) .
On shorter exposure , tyrosine phosphorylation of two STATS iso-forms ( STATS a and b ) was observed .
A slight decrease in JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation seen in Fig .
5 in the P357G transfectants was not constantly reproducible .
In the other GM-CSFRa mutant cell lines , GM-CSF did not induce detectable JAK2 or STATS tyrosine phosphorylation .
Activation of STATS in wild-type and P357G GM-CSFRa transfectants was also detected by gel shift assay using y-interferon-activated site of the IRF-1 promoter and anti-STAT5 antibody ( data not shown ) .
These data indicated that the same regions of GM-CSFRa that are essential for GM-CSF-induced Shc-ERK phosphorylation are also essential for the induction of JAK2 and STATS tyrosine phosphorylation .
Protooncogene Expression in GM-CSFRa Transfectants-GM-CSF has been shown to induce rapid expression of a number of protooncogenes , including c-fos , c-jun , and c-myc ( 29 , 35 ) .
In wild-type GM-CSFRa and the P357G transfectants , expression of c-fos , c-jun , and e-mye mRNAs was rapidly induced upon hGM-CSF stimulation ( Fig .
6 ) .
In contrast , the expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA was not induced in the other a subunit mutants except ter3 .
In ter3 mutant receptor cell lines , hGM-CSF was capable of inducing c-jun but not c-fos mRNA .
In contrast , induction of c-mye mRNA expression was repeatedly observed in both the wild type and all of the mutant clones , indicating that hGM-CSF is able to induce c-mye mRNA in the absence of GM-CSFRa cytoplasmic domain and that all of the mutant receptors are capable of signaling .
The Cytoplasmic Domain of GM-CSFRa Is Critical for GM-CSF-mediated Cell Proliferation-We next examined hGM-CSF-induced cell proliferation of WT1Q transfectants expressing a chain mutants .
As shown in Fig .

chain cytoplasmic domain is indispensable for hGM-CSF-mediated growth signal transduction .
These studies confirm our earlier findings about the role of GM-CSFRa cytoplasmic domain in promoting growth of BaF/3 cells ( 16 ) .
Treatment of ter clones that lack the C-terminal 18 amino acid residues of a chain with hGM-CSF did not lead to an increase in the cell numbers .
Instead , the cells died , but more slowly than terl clones ( Fig .
7 ) .
In MTS cell proliferation as-says , ter3 clones clearly showed hGM-CSF-mediated cell proliferation signal , although it was weaker than wild type or P357G clones ( Fig .
8 ) .
Cell death in factor-dependent cells is known to occur through apoptotic mechanisms .
To examine if apoptosis occurred in ter3 cell number in the presence of hGM-CSF , genomic DNA was isolated from a chain transfectants incubated with hGM-CSF and DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis ( Fig .

These results suggest that ter3 mutants that are able to transduce a cell proliferation signal by GM-CSF have severely impaired anti-apoptotic signaling .
hGM-CSF -induced Monocytic Differentiation of WTI19 Cells Expressing hGM-CSF Receptors-Next we analyzed hGM-CSF-induced differentiation of WTI1Q cells expressing human GM-CSFRa .
All the a subunit transfectants examined retained the ability to differentiate when mGM-CSF was added to the medium ( data not shown ) .

After incubation with hGM-CSF for 3 days , the cells were examined for monocytic differentiation by morphology , F4/80 , and Mac3 surface expression .
As shown in Fig .
10 , after 3 days of incubation with GM-CSF , cells transfected with either the wild type GM-CSFRa or P357G showed characteristic morphology of monocytic lineage : larger cell sizes , fine-stranded nuclear appearance , and a variable number of cytoplasmic vacuoles .
Both the morphologic and cell surfaces changes induced by hGM-CSF were identical to those induced by mGM-CSF treatment .
They also showed increased surface expression of F4/80 and Mac3 ( Fig .

None of the clones containing terl , dell , del2 , del3 , P358G , or P360G was able to differentiate when incubated with hGM-CSF ( Figs .

In contrast , all ter8 clones that were derived ( five independent clones ) differentiated as well as wild type clones in response to hGM-CSF ( Figs .

DISCUSSION The GM-CSF receptor signals by ligand-mediated het-erodimerization of GM-CSFRa and GM-CSFR $ .
Although the cytoplasmic domain of the GM-CSFRa is only 54 amino acids , this short region of the receptor is necessary for GM-CSF-induced cell proliferation ( 16-18 ) .
In the present study , we have compared the role of GM-CSFRa cytoplasmic domain in GM-CSF-mediated cell proliferation , survival , and differentiation .
This analysis was made possible by our use of the WT19Q cell line , which grows but does not differentiate in mIL-3 .
In comparison , mGM-CSF induces differentiation , but does not stop the growth of these cells .

The WTI1Q cells are equally capable of responding to both murine and human GM-CSF when transfected with the wild type human GM-CSF receptor subunits .
By using a mutant GM-CSF Ra lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain , we have shown that the cytoplasmic domain of GM-CSFRa is essential for both hGM-CSF-dependent cell differentiation and proliferation .
This mutant was still able to interact with the -chain to form a high affinity receptor complex ( Table II ) , suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain of GM-CSFRa is not necessary for receptor dimerization .
The GM-CSFRa cytoplasmic domain was necessary for the phosphorylation of signaling molecules , JAK2 , STAT5 , She , and ERKs and the induction of c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression .
Weak activation of STAT1 and STAT3 by GM-CSF have recently been reported in polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( 36 ) .
However , we could not detect the activation of these STAT 's in any of the transfectants in response to GM-CSF ( data not shown ) .
Deletion of the intracytoplasmic domain did not abolish e-mye mRNA induction after GM-CSF stimulation .
Similar results were observed by us using BaF/3 cells ( 16 ) .
Using other cell systems and varying approaches other laboratories have suggested that the internal portion of the GM-CSFRa may not have a major role in regulating receptor function .
For example , using a chimera of the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin receptor and the intracellular domain of the murine IL-3 receptor B chain ( AIC2A ) , the addition of erythropoietin to the receptor was able to stimulate cell growth ( 37 ) .
Another study demonstrated that a chimera comprising the extracellular region of GM-CSFRa and the intracellular domain of the hfe can also transduce signals ( 38 ) .
These data suggest that dimerization of the B-chain is important .
However , they do not necessarily exclude the possibility that the GM-CSFRa is an important dimerization partner , and there are no physiologic data demonstrating that two B chains dimer ize to initiate signaling in normal cells .
Both the a and B subunits have proline-rich regions close to the plasma mem-brane , and both of these regions are important for receptor function .
In addition , we have shown that deletion of the « internal segment blocks both growth and differentiation .
By using deletion mutants of GM-CSFa , we demonstrate that the membrane proximal proline-rich region and the adjacent 15 amino acids of the a subunit are indispensable for both cell proliferation and differentiation ( Figs .
2 , 7 , and 10 ) .
The proline-rich region of GM-CSFRa contains a Pro-X-Pro sequence that exists in the membrane-proximal box1l region of many other members of cytokine receptors ( Fig .
3B ) .
Mutation of this domain in the IL6 receptor gp130 protein ( 39 ) and in the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor ( 40 ) eliminated receptor activity .
We have here shown that similar mutations ( P358G , P360G ) also result in a receptor that is unable to mediate proliferation , differentiation , or other signaling events .
Proline 357 could be part of a Pro-X-X-Pro motif , such as has also been found in cytokine receptors and SH3-binding proteins ( 41 ) .
This proline appears to be dispensable , however , since the P357G mutant was able to fully support proliferation and differentiation .
The region downstream from the proline-rich domain was also indispensable for hGM-CSF-dependent transduction of cell growth , survival , and differentiation signals .
These 15 amino acid residues , which include aspartic acid 368 , are conserved in ILG receptor a , prolactin receptor , growth hormone receptor , and IL2 receptor y-chain .
Our studies show that tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STATS is inhibited by the deletion of this region , demonstrating that the proline-rich domain alone is not sufficient for the GM-CSF-induced activation of the JAK2 signal transduction pathway .
Similar results have been obtained in other systems .
Deletion of 6 amino acids of the region downstream of proline-rich domain of IL5 receptor a , including the conserved aspartic acid , abolished IL5-induced JAK2 acti- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog GM-CSFR « -Chain Mediates Cell Differentiation 100 100 $ alone PARENTAL -a- GM : clone 1 # GM : clone 2 - 3 1 a 3 i f 01-7 t 0.17 -4- GM : clone 3 -+- mils 0.01 c.01 1-9 day0 day1 day2 days days dayO day ?

At the times indicated , the number of viable cells in each culture was determined by trypan blue staining .
The results were expressed relative to the cell number on day 0 of this experiment .
Three independent clones of each cell type were assayed yielding similar results .
The average value of the three clones was shown for mIL8 responses .
vation ( 42 ) , while mutation of the region immediately downstream of box1l region in the erythropoietin ( 43 ) and IL6 receptors ( 39 ) blocked the activation of JAK2 .
Interestingly , our data about proline mutations in the box1l region were different from the recently published study on the IL-5 receptor « -chain .
In the previous report , the existence of any one of the three proline residues was adequate for IL-5-mediated cell proliferation signal ( 42 ) .
The difference between these findings could be secondary to differences in sequence in the a-chains ( PPVPQI , GM-CSF receptor ; PPIPAP , IL-5 recep-tor ) , or , possibly the difference in results could be due to the divergence in amino acid residues adjacent to the proline-rich domain .
The C-terminal deletion of GM-CSFRa only partially inhibited the hGM-CSF -induced cell proliferation ( Figs .
7 and 8 ) , but the cells died within several days due to the extensive apoptosis in the presence of hGM-CSF ( Fig .

In the transfectants of this C-terminal deletion mutant ( ter3 ) , hGM-CSF-induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation was severely impaired ( Fig .

She , when tyrosine-phosphorylated , binds to SH2 domains of Grb2 , which leads to the recruitment of Sos , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras , to the plasma membrane ( 45 ) .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of She is thought to play an important role in GM-CSF-mediated activation of Ras through this mechanism ( 27 ) .
In ter3 transfectants , tyrosine phosphorylation of She was not detectable in response to hGM-CSF stimulation ( Fig .
5A ) .
hGM-CSF-induced activation of Ras-ERK pathway appeared to be impaired in these transfectants , since hGM-CSF-mediated ERK phosphorylation and c-fos in-duction , which are downstream events regulated by Ras activation ( 46 , 47 ) , could not be detected ( Fig .
6 ) .
Our findings are compatible with a previous report that Ras activation is necessary for anti-apoptotic effect by GM-CSF , but not essential for GM-CSF-mediated DNA synthesis ( 27 ) .
Our results demonstrate that ter3 transfectants differentiated as well as wild type transfectants in response to hGM-CSF .
The ter3 clones are capable of stimulating increases in e-mye and to a lesser extent c-jun , but do not cause the phosphorylation of Jak2 , STAT , and She , suggesting that activation of these proteins is not necessary for differentiation .
The findings that ter3 cells die of apoptosis while they were capable of differentiation in hGM-CSF suggests that the pathways controlling cell survival and differentiation can be separated and are controlled by different portions of the GM-CSFRa .
hGM-CSF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STATS5 could not be detected in ter8 clones ( Fig .
5 , B and C ) , suggesting that these pathways may be important for the inhibition of apoptosis .

Morphological changes of WTI9 transfectants in response to hGM-CSF .
WT19 GM-CSFRa transfectants were maintained in mIL3 alone or mIL3 + 10 ng/ml hGM-CSF .
Wright staining was performed ( original magnifi-cation , X400 ) on day 3 .
As a control , parental WT19 cells were maintained in mIL3 or mIL3 + 10 ng/ml mGM-CSF .
of a chimeric protein of CD16 and Jak2 is capable of preventing cell death , implying that part of the function of the Jak/STAT pathway could be to inhibit apoptosis ( 51 ) .
In contrast to other signal transduction pathways , both c-mye and c-jun were induced in ter3 transfectants by hGM-CSF to similar levels to that seen in wild type transfectants , suggesting that e-mye and c-jun can be induced without the activation of either ERKs or JAK2 .
In a recent report , it was shown that the transient expression of the dominant negative form of JAK2 inhibited hGM-CSF-induced transcription of a reporter plasmid containing the c-mye promoter , suggesting that JAK2 is essential for c-mye mRNA induction by hGM-CSF ( 48 ) .
It is possible that inhibition of e-mye promoter was caused by a nonspecific effect of the overexpression of dominant-negative JAK2 , although further experiments will be needed to clarify this possibility .
c-jun overexpression induces monocytic differentiation of the WEHI-3B ( 49 ) and U937 cells ( 50 ) , while c-fos overexpression did not have similar biologic effects ( 49 ) .
However , it is unlikely that c-jun alone is responsible for hGM-CSF-mediated cell differentiation , as c-jun mRNA expression was equivalently induced by mIL3 , which has no effect on the differentiated phenotype of WTI1Q cells ( data not shown ) .
In summary , specific regions of the intracytoplasmic domain of the a subunit play an essential role in hGM-CSF-mediated cell proliferation , survival , and differentiation , while the signal transduction pathway which controls e-mye activation is inde- P | % .
