Rom* Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine , Department of Medicine , New York University Medical Center , 550 First Avenue , New York , NY 10016 Communicated by H. Sherwood Lawrence , July 21 , 1993 ( received for review December 23 , 1992 ) ABSTRACT The host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis includes granuloma formation at sites of infection and systemic symptoms .
Cytokines have been identified by immu-nohistochemistry in granulomas in animal models of bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) infection and are released by mononuclear phagocytes upon stimulation by mycobacterial pro-teins .
In this regard , the cytokine interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) may play a role in the clinical manifestations and pathological events of tuberculosis infection .
We have demonstrated that lipoarabi-nomannan ( LAM ) from the mycobacterial cell wall , which was virtually devoid of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , stimulated mononuclear phagocytes to release IL-6 in a dose-response manner .
LAM and LPS were potent inducers of IL-6 gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes .
Both LAM- and LPS-inducible IL-6 promoter activity was localized to a DNA fragment , positions -158 to -49 , by deletion analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay .
Two nuclear factor NF-IL6 ( positions -153 to -145 and -83 to -75 ) and one nuclear factor NF-xB ( positions -72 to -63 ) motifs are present within this fragment .
Site-directed mutagenesis of one or more of these motifs within the IL-6 promoter demonstrated that each has positive regulatory activity and that they could act in a func-tion- and orientation-independent manner .
Deletion of all three elements abolished inducibility of IL-6 promoter activity by both LAM and LPS .
We conclude that the NF-IL6 and NF-xB sites mediate IL-6 induction in response to both LPS and LAM , acting as bacterial or mycobacterial response elements .
The variety of human cell-mediated immune defenses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis is reflected in the wide range of clinical manifestations of active disease ( 1 , 2 ) .
Ineffective cellular immunity results in the failure of localization of M. tuberculosis infection with absence of granuloma formation .
Tumor necrosis factor a ( TNF-a ) , interleukin 18 ( IL-1 ) , and interferon y are thought to play a part in human cell-mediated immune response to infection with many facultative intracellular pathogens , including Listeria monocytogenes , Leish-mania , Candida , and mycobacteria ( 3-6 ) .
TNF-a is also required for localization of mycobacterial infection and granuloma formation ( 7 , 8 ) .
Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) is a multifunc-tional cytokine regulating immune responses and the acute-phase protein response ( 9-11 ) .
In active tuberculosis , the role of IL-6 may be predominantly negative .
This is supported by several facts : ( ? )
IL-6 promotes the growth of mycobacteria in peripheral blood monocytes ( 12 , 13 ) .
( i ? )
IL-6 inhibits the production of TNF-a and IL-18B , which may enhance intracellular killing of microorganisms and development of gran-ulomata ( 14 , 15 ) .
M. tuberculosis components stimulate the release of both IL-18 and TNF-a from mononuclear phagocytes ( 16-21 ) .
TNF-a has been shown to accumulate in granulomas of The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
2225 experimental models of tuberculosis infection , and pretreat-ment with anti-TNF-a antibody results in poorly formed granulomas , dissemination of the mycobacteria , and death of the animal ( 8 ) .
TNF-a and IL-1 $ induce IL-6 in human fibroblasts by activating nuclear factors that bind to a NF- « B-like sequence ( 22 ) .
IL-6 may be a negative modulator of TNF-a and IL-1 in active tuberculosis favoring dissemination of the disease .
In this regard , in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals , hypergammaglobulinemia and expansion of B cells may be likely a result of IL-6 ( 23 ) .
Tuberculosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals takes on a more aggressive course with dense aggregates of organisms in infected tissue , poorly formed and fewer granulomata , and more frequent miliary presentation ( 24-26 ) .
Alveolar macrophages phagocytose mycobacteria but have difficulty with intracellular killing .
The cell wall of mycobacteria does not contain lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , which is a well known inducer of IL-6 .
However , lipoarab-inomannan ( LAM ) , a complex lipid glycoprotein anchored in the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol , shares many physicochemical properties with LPS ( 27 , 28 ) .
To determine whether purified LAM , virtually devoid of LPS contamina-tion , could induce the production of IL-6 , we measured IL-6 protein and mRNA levels after exposure of human peripheral blood monocytes to LAM .
Not only was IL-6 protein and mRNA increased but also IL-6 promoter activity was markedly enhanced by LAM or LPS .
MATERIALS AND METHODS LAM from laboratory-attenuated M. tuberculosis H37Ra was kindly provided by P. Brennan ( Colorado State Univer-sity , Ft. Collins ) .
The LAM had been passed through a Detoxi-Gel column using sterile pyrogen-free water and stored in pyrogen-free vials from which any contaminating LPS had been removed .
Only pyrogen-free water was used in reconstitution of this material .
Evaluation of tuberculosis reagents including LAM for the presence of Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin was done with the amebocyte lysate assay ( E-toxate kit , Sigma ) .
Six lots of LAM obtained between 1990 to 1993 contained < 10 pg of LPS per ug of LAM per batch .
Isolation of Human Monocytes from Peripheral Blood .
Mononuclear cells in peripheral blood from purified-protein-derivative-negative donors were separated by centrifugation over lymphocyte-separation medium ( Flow Laboratories ) .

The cells were seeded onto the plastic surface of a flask to allow monocytes to adhere .
Human myelomonocytic leukemic cell line THP-1 ( ATCC ) or the isolated human peripheral blood monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) fetal bovine se-rum .
IL-6 protein levels in cell supernatants were measured with a commercial ELISA kit ( Biokine , Cambridge , MA ) .
Isolation of RNA and Northern Blot Analysis .
Human peripheral blood monocytes were treated with test reagents , collected by centrifugation , and lysed by addition of 5.5 M guanidinium isothiocyanate buffer .
Total RNA was isolated through CsCl ; gradient ultracentrifugation .
An equal amount of RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1 % agarose/6 % formaldehyde denaturing gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter ( BA 85 , Schleicher & Schuell ) .
The baked filter was prehybridized at 42°C for 6-12 hr .
For hybridization , the IL-6 cDNA ( kindly provided by J. Vilcek , New York University ) was nick-translated with [ « -P ] dCTP ( specific activity , 3000 Ci/mmol ; 1 Ci = 37 GBq ; New England Nuclear ) .
The hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 10 hr .
The filter was then washed in 2 % standard saline citrate ( SSC ) /0.5 % SDS at room temperature for 20 min followed by 0.1x SSC/0.5 % SDS at 65°C for 30 min .
The filter was then exposed to film at -70°C .
Plasmid Construction and Site-Directed Mutagenesis .
Serial deletion mutant constructs of IL-6 5 ' flanking region were as described ( 22 ) .
Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to directions in the Bio-Rad site-directed mutagenesis kit .
The mutant oligonucleotides synthesized were as follows : NF-IL6 ( positions -153 to -145 ) to 5-CCGTACAAT-3 ' , NF-IL6 ( positions -83 to -75 ) to 5 !
-CCATAAAAT-3 ' , and NF-KB ( positions -72 to -63 ) to 5-CTCATTTTCC-3 ' .
The IL-6 fragment , positions -224 to +11 , was used as the template .
The achieved mutant IL-6 DNA sequences were verified by DNA sequencing .
Seven single or combined mutations were obtained : single NF-IL6 site mutation , double NF-IL6 site mutations , a combined NF-IL6 and NF- « B \site mutation , and triple ( two NF-IL6 and one NF-KB sites ) mutations .
Transient Transfection of Human Suspension Cultures and the Assay of Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase ( CAT ) Activ-ity .
THP-1 cells were transfected with various IL-6 DNA constructs in the plasmid pTK ( - ) CAT by the DEAE-dextran method ( 29 ) .
Briefly , 10 `` cells were washed in STBS ( 25 mM Tris , pH 7.4/137 mM NaCl/5 mM KCI/0.6 mM Na ; HPO , / 0.7 mM CaC1 , /0.5 mM MgC ) ; ) , transfected with 10 ug of CsCl , -purified plasmids in 1 ml of DEAE-dextran ( 400 ug/ml ) at 37°C for 90 min .
The transfected cells were then incubated in complete medium for 24 hr in the absence or presence of inducing agents .
The transfected cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles , and equal amounts of protein from different cell extracts were assayed for CAT activity ( 30 ) .
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and DNA Mobility Shift Assay .
Cell extracts were prepared from THP-1 cells by using the method of Dignam et al .
( 31 ) .
Cultures ( 5 x 108 cells ) were lysed by homogenization in buffer A [ 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.9/1.5 mM MgCl ; /10 mM KCI/O0.5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) /0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ] and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at 4°C to separate the nuclei from the cytosolic fraction .
The nuclear proteins were extracted in buffer C [ 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9/25 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol/0.42 M NaCl/1.5 mM MgCl ; /0.2 mM EDTA/O.5 mM DTT/0.5 mM phenyImethyisuilfony } fluoride ] on ice for 30 min with shaking .
The extracted nuclear proteins were dialyzed against buffer D ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9/20 % glycero !
/0.1 M KCI/0.2 mM EDTA/O0.5 mM DTT/O0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) for 5 hr and frozen in liquid nitrogen in aliquots .

RESULTS Mycobacterial Cell Wall Component LAM Stimulates the Release of IL-6 Protein and Expression of IL-6 mRNA from Peripheral Blood Monocytes .
Monocytes released a significant amount of IL-6 in the presence of LAM at 0.1 ng/ml over a 24-hr period with a maximal response at 2 ug/ml !
( Fig .
1 ) .
The half-maximal effect occurred at 500 ng/ml ( EDsp ) , which was chosen as the dose for subsequent experiments .
Live M. tuberculosis H37Ra and a clinical isolate of M. tuberculosis exhibited a parallel dose-response stimulation of IL-6 release .
The effect of LAM was not due to contamination by LPS because the LPS content in 1 ug of LAM was < 10 pg in all LAM aliquots , as determined by Limulus amebocyte assay , and LPS at 10 pg/ml could not stimulate the production of IL-6 as detected by ELISA .
Polymyxin B at 10 ug/ml inhibited the LPS effect , whereas it had no effect on the ability of LAM to stimulate IL-6 release .
To examine whether the increased release of IL-6 protein was in parallel to the expression of IL-6 mRNA , we measured the levels of IL-6 mRNA by Northern blot analysis .
In this experiment , we used peripheral blood monocytes and the human myelomonocytic leukemic cell line THP-1 , which was used for transient transfection experiments shown later .
The IL-6 mRNA levels were significantly increased in blood monocytes and THP-1 cells after stimulation with LAM or LPS for 4 hr ( Fig .
2 ) .
Fig .

This suggested that the increased IL-6 mRNA level contributes to the enhanced release of IL-6 protein detected in the cell culture supernatants .

Regulation of IL-6 Gene Transcription by LAM and LPS in THP-1 Cells .
To further investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the expression of the IL-6 gene is regulated upon exposure to M. tuberculosis , we mapped DNA regulatory elements on the 5 ' flanking region of the IL-6 gene that responded to LAM and compared them with LPS , a well known inducer of IL-6 .
Serial IL-6 deletion mutant constructs were transiently transfected into THP-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran method , and CAT assay was carried out ( Fig .
3 , schematic of IL-6 promoter elements and deletion mu-tants ) .
CAT activity was induced with the IL-6 construct , positions -1158 to +11 , after stimulation with LAM or LPS AP-1 | Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 91 ( 1994 ) 2227 ( Fig .
4 ) .
There was increased CAT activity after stimulation by LAM or LPS with the constructs , positions -224 to +11 , positions -158 to +11 , and positions -109 to +11 .
Further deletion to position -49 totally abolished the induction of CAT activity after stimulation with LAM or LPS .
Sequence analysis demonstrated that deletion from positions -158 to -109 resulted in removal of a NF-IL6 binding site ( positions -153 to -145 ) , and further deletion to position -49 led to removal of another NF-IL6 binding site ( positions -83 to -75 ) and a NF- « B binding site ( positions -72 to -63 ) .
To test whether NF-IL6 [ consensus sequence , T ( T/ G ) NNGNAA ( T/G ) ] and NF- « B binding sequences contribute to the stimulatory activities by LAM or LPS , we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the IL-6 DNA fragment from positions -224 to +11 , in which seven mutation constructs were made and tested in the presence or absence of LAM or LPS ( Fig .
5 ) .
The CAT activity produced with the .
wild-type fragment from positions -224 to +11 is shown in Fig .
4 .
Mutation of the 5 NF-IL6 site with intact 3 ' NF-IL6 and NF-KB sites resulted in inducible CAT activity that was similar to that seen with the unmutated construct .
With a mutation of the 3° NF-IL6 site alone or after a single mutation of the NF-KB site , IL-6 promoter activity was still inducible by LAM or LPS , albeit at a somewhat reduced level .
Mutation of two of the three sites showed inducibility to be S-fold with NF- « B intact , 4-fold with 3 ' NF-IL6 intact , and 3-fold with 5 NF-IL6 intact .
The fold increase from the construct with the 3° NF-IL6 intact was 3.8 and 3.7 , respectively , after stimulation with LAM and LPS , which was notably greater than the 2.9- and 2.7-fold increase seen with the construct with only the 5° NF-IL6 intact .
Mutation of all three nuclear binding elements abolished activation of IL-6 promoter activity by LAM or LPS .
These experiments suggested that the two NF-IL6 sites and the NF- « B site on the IL-6 gene functioned as positive regulatory sequences in response to the induction with LAM or LPS .
Each site can function in an independent manner after mutation of the other two sites , but the relative importance of each of the three elements is different .
LAM and LPS Stimulate Interaction Between Nuclear Protein ( s ) and NF-IL6 or NF-xB Sequences .
The deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis experiments described above suggest that the NF-IL6 and NF- « B sites are the positive regulatory elements for LAM or LPS stimulation .
To determine whether these sequences interact specifically with nuclear proteins , DNA mobility shift assay was performed .
Incubation of nuclear extracts from LAM- or LPS-stimulated cells with the 5 ' NF-IL6 probe led to the appearance of a protein-DNA complex ( Fig .
6 , lanes 2 and 3 , respectively ) .

Similar results are shown with the NF- « B probe .
Experiments not shown demonstrated similar results with DNA mobility shift assay with the 3 ' NF-IL6 probe .
DISCUSSION In this report , we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which IL-6 gene expression is regulated upon exposure of mononuclear phagocytes to M. tuberculosis or its components ( 33 ) .
LAM purified from the cell wall and live M. tuberculosis appeared to be significant enhancers of IL-6 expression , and LAM and LPS shared common mechanisms for the activation of IL-6 promoter elements .
The LAM had been shown to be LPS-free and LPS inhibitors did not affect the results ( 19 , 34 ) : both targeted inducing activity on NF-IL6 and NF- « B motifs .

the other .
These data suggested that < 200 bp ( from positions -158 to -49 ) of the IL-6 gene contains the major promoter activity in response to LAM or LPS .
Within this fragment were two NF-IL6 and one NF-KB sites , all demonstrating positive regulatory activities , although the 5° NF-IL6 was demonstrably less potent than the 3 ' NF-IL6 , and the NF- « B site appeared to be the most potent enhancer element ( Fig .
5 ) .
Importantly , mutation of all NF-IL6 and NF- « B sequences abolished IL-6 promoter activity after incubation with LAM or LPS .
LAM or LPS could induce specific binding of nuclear proteins to the NF- « B or NF-IL6 wild-type target sequences .
These data suggest that binding of the LAM- or LPS-induced transcription factors to the IL-6 regulatory region mediated transcriptional activation of IL-6 .
This report also demonstrates that LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and LAM from mycobacteria function through similar mechanisms : they both activate NF-IL6 and NF- « B on the IL-6 gene .
We propose NF-IL6 or NF- « B are important mycobacterial or bacterial response elements and may be relevant to other host cytokines .
Previous investigators have evaluated the IL-6 5 ' flanking region enhancer/promoter sites that responded to IL-18 .

However , Lieberman and Baltimore ( 36 ) and others ( 20 , 37 ) provided convincing evidence including site-directed mutagenesis that a NF- « B site ( positions -73 to -63 ) was the key IL-1 and TNF-a responsive enhancer/promoter element on IL-6 .
In-terestingly , Lieberman and Baltimore ( 36 ) stated that there was a nearby unidentified sequence that could act synergis-tically with NF- « B .
Close inspection of our data reveals synergism between our 3 ' NF-IL6 site and NF- « B ( Fig .
5 ) .
Isshiki et al .
( 38 ) identified a 14-bp palindromic sequence that overlapped our 5 NF-IL6 site that was an IL-1 responsive element .
This was consistent with our data demonstrating that the 5° NF-IL6 and the other two enhancer/promoter sequences acted independent of each other and orientation .
Akira et al .
( 39 ) cloned the NF-IL6 gene and observed that it had high sequence homology with C/EBP , a family of rat liver nuclear factors .
They noted that NF-IL6 bound to the regulatory regions of several genes involved in the acute-phase response and present in macrophages including TNF-a , IL-8 , IL-18 , albumin , haptoglobin , granulocyte col-ony-stimulating factor , and C reactive protein .
Clinical investigations of peripheral blood monocytes and bronchoalveolar lavage cells will help clarify the presence of IL-6 in active tuberculosis infection and determine whether modulating IL-6 has a role in assisting host defense mechanisms as a potential therapeutic strategy .
