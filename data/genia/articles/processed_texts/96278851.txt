Nathan , and Bernard Mathey-Prevot§ From the Divisions of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Children 's Hospital and the Department of Pediatrics , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Tissue-specific expression of interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) is mediated via cis-acting elements located within 315 base pairs of the transcription start .
This is achieved in part through the positive activities of the AP-1 and Elf-1 sites in the IL-3 promoter .
The contribution to T cell-specific expression by other promoter sites was assessed in a transient expression assay with IL-3 promoter constructs linked to a luciferase gene , focusing initially on the core binding factor ( CBF ) site , which is footprinted in vivo upon T cell activation .
Activity of the CBF site is shown to be critically dependent on the adjacent activator site Act-1 .
Together the Act-1 and CBF sites form a functional unit ( AC unit ) with dual activity .
The AC unit is demonstrated to enhance basal activity of promoters both in fibroblasts and T cells .
This activity is further inducible in activated T cells , but not in fibroblasts .
In addition to the already identified NIP repressor site , evidence is presented for a second repressor region that restricts promoter activity in fibroblasts .
Finally , a novel positive regulatory element has been mapped in the IL-3 promoter between nucleotide -180 and -210 that leads to increased expression in T cells .
Together these results demonstrate that T cell expression of IL-3 is not specified by the activity of a single tissue-specific element , but instead involves multiple interacting elements that provide both specific positive regulation in T cells and specific negative regulation in fibroblasts .
Interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) `` is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells ( 1 ) .
Consistent with its potent biologic activity , IL-3 gene expression is highly regulated and is restricted to human T and NK cells ( 2 ) .
Therefore , the IL-3 promoter has been extensively studied , and multiple regulatory elements have been identified within 315 bp of the transcription start site ( 3-6 ) .

The activity of individual regulatory elements has been extensively studied in the context of multiple promoters/enhanc-ers ( 7-11 ) .
However , the emphasis on identifying novel regulatory elements has prevented a complete understanding of the functional interactions between elements already identified .
These interactions are important as they represent another possible level of regulatory activity and may in part specify the differential expression of genes despite impressive similarities of their promoters .
For example , the promoter for both granu-locyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and IL-3 bind many similar proteins but exhibit different patterns of expression , with GM-CSF being produced by fibroblasts , macrophages , and endothelial cells ( 4 , 5 , 8 , 10 ) .
Therefore , the activity of a particular site may vary according to the context within which it is found , as adjoining regulatory sites may modulate its activity ( 4 , 12 ) .
The IL-3 promoter is well suited to address possible functional interactions between different regulatory elements , since a relatively small region of DNA contains several well characterized sites that are important outside the context of IL-3 regulation .
We initially focused on the normal function of CBF , since mutations of this protein complex are associated with specific subtypes of acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) and myelodyspastic syndrome ( MDS ) ( 13-17 ) .
In the present study we demonstrate that the CBF site and adjacent Act-1 element form a regulatory unit that provides inducible promoter activity in Jurkat T cells , but not in NIH3T3 fibroblasts .
We also demonstrate that two additional upstream portions of the IL-3 promoter inhibit promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells .
Finally , an initial characterization of a previously unknown positive regulatory region of the IL-3 promoter between nt -180 and nt -207 is provided .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture-The human Jurkat T cell line E6.1 and NIH3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in 5 % CO , at 37 °C .
Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with penicillin ( 50 units/ml ) , streptomycin ( 50 ug/ml ) , and 10 % fetal calf serum ( RPMI complete ) .
NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with penicillin , streptomycin , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , and 10 % fetal calf serum ( DMEM complete ) .
Jurkat cells were stimulated with a combination of TPA ( 10 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 0.5 um ) .
NIH3T3 cells were stimulated with TPA alone .
IL-3 Promoter Constructs-Isolation of the -315-bp IL-3 promoter and insertion into an IL-3 reporter gene has already been described ( 18 ) .
Similarly , G-C mutation of the CBF site of the IL-3 promoter has been described ( 18 ) .
Briefly , guanine -139 , -137 , and -136 within the CBF binding site were selectively mutated to cytosine using standard polymerase chain reaction methodology .
This mutation abrogates CBF protein binding .
Flanking HindIII sites were added to transfer the full-length -815-bp promoter , or G-C mutant ( -315/GC ) , to the lucif- 14020 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Functional Role of CBF in the Regulation of Interleukin-3 14021 TaBLE I Synthetic oligonucleotides used in the synthesis of IL-3 promoter constructs 1A : synthetic oligonucleotides used to insert various AC units at nt -180 of the full-length ( -315 bp ) IL-3 promoter .

An independent , higher yield luciferase reporter gene ( pFlash* ) was derived from the pFlash vector ( SynapsSys Corp. , Burl-ington , MA ) by excision of the downstream polylinker between Apal and Smal , followed by replacement of the Sstl-Xbal ( luciferase nt 57 ) pFlash upstream polylinker with the equivalent fragment from the luciferase reporter gene , pXpl ( pFlash* ) .
The IL-3 promoter was then inserted at the new upstream HindIII site ( -815pF*/-315/GCpF* ) .
All reporter genes used in a particular experiment were derived from the same root plasmid .
Specific constructs are depicted schematically within individual figures and were derived as follows .
A second CBF site ( CBF* ) was created at nt -192 using standard polymerase chain reaction methodology to introduce a C-G and T-G mutation at nt -191 and nt -189 , respectively .
Replacement of the DNA fragment between nt -180 and nt -207 with an AC unit was done via two intermediate cloning steps .
The resultant promoter had an inserted oligonucleotide , 5'-atggATGAATAATTACGTCTGTGGTTT-teta- , that contained an AC unit ( upper case letters ) in place of the 27-bp Msel ( nt -207 ) -SauSa ( nt -180 ) fragment in the -315pL expression vector ( -315NACpL ) .
The equivalent replacement was made in an IL-3 promoter containing a G-C mutation at the endogenous CBF site ( -315NAC/GCpL ) .
AC units were also inserted at nt -180 of the -3815 promoter in -315pL to create promoters without deletion of endogenous nucleotides .
AC cassettes contained mutations in none , one , or both members of the AC unit .
The individual cassettes were synthetic oligonucleotides obtained from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute core facility ( Table IA ) .
Addition of AC units containing either wild type or mutant Act-1 and CBF sites to a minimal ( -61 bp ) IL-3 promoter was accomplished via replacement of the IL-3 promoter upstream of nt -61 with one of the synthetic oligonucleotides summarized in Table IB .
This was accomplished using the -815pF* vector digested at the 5 Ssfl site of the -315pF* polylinker and the 3 `` Smal site at nt -61 of the IL-3 promoter ( -61pF* ) .
This construct contained 61 bp of the IL-3 promoter upstream of the transcription start site , including the TATA box at nt The various Act-1-CBF oligonucleotides were inserted in place of the 254 deleted nucleotides between nt -61 and nt -315 .
Intermediate length IL-3 promoters were derived from -315pF* via deletion of upstream regions of the promoter from nt -173 ( Seal ) , nt -180 ( Sauda ) or nt -210 ( Msel ) .
All constructs were confirmed by restriction analysis .
Any construct made using polymerase chain reaction techniques or utilizing synthetic oligonucleotides was also confirmed by DNA sequencing .
Plasmid DNA was twice purified over cesium chloride prior to transfection .
Transient Transfection-Jurkat T cells were transfected with 1 ug of DNA/1O® cells using either the DEAE-dextran method as described ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) or by electroporation in serum free conditions using a 300-V , 980-uF , and 14-ms discharge ( PG 200 Progenitor 2 , Hoeffer Scientific Instruments , San Francisco , CA ) .
Cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented as above for 16 h after transfection and were then stimulated with a combination of TPA and ionomycin .
Cell lysates were harvested 6-9 h after stimulation and assayed for luciferase activity ( Analytical Luminescence Laboratory , San Diego , CA ) .
NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented as above and transfected at 20 % confluence with 15 ug of DNA/1O0 em `` tissue culture plate ( Becton Dickinson , Lincoln Park , NJ ) using a standard calcium phosphate method .
Sixteen to 24 h after adding CaP , plates were washed three times with calcium/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline .
Cells were grown overnight in fresh DMEM complete prior to stimulation with TPA .
Stimulation of NIHS3T3 cells with a combination of TPA and ionomycin decreased expression of all reporter constructs as compared with unstimulated or TPA-stimulated cells .
Cell extracts were obtained 6-9 h after stimulation and assayed for luciferase activity ( Analytical Luminescence Laboratory ) .
Normalizing data of a test reporter gene according to the relative activity of a second , B-galactosidase , gene is a standard methodology .
However , we `` and others have found that the measured B-galactosidase activity ( or that of another co-transfected construct ) is dependent on several factors other than efficiency of transfection ( 20 , 21 ) .
Therefore , it is an unreliable method for normalization .
It has also been our experience that spectrophotometry has not quantitated plasmid DNA as precisely as expected and that the efficiency of transfection is critically dependent on the purity of the transfected plasmid .
Therefore , we perform replicate experiments using independently isolated and purified plasmids .
All luciferase constructs in a particular experiment are : ( a ) derived from the same root plasmid , ( 5 ) differ only by a small number of nucleotides , ( c ) are twice purified over cesium chloride , and ( d ) quantitated by both spectrophotometry and on agarose gel .
This is consistent with the methods proposed by others ( 21 ) .
Using this proce-dure , replicate transfections using independent isolates of the same luciferase construct have yielded differences in luciferase activity of < 10 % .
This is more consistent , and accurate , than normalizing data to the independently variable activity of a co-transfected second construct .
Luciferase activity was measured as relative light units ( RLU ) ( Mono-light Luminometer model 2010 ) .
All data are presented as the mean relative luciferase activity as calculated by the formula ( RLUt=* « onstruct/ RL [ reference construct ) ¥iror Bars indicate 1 standard deviation of the mean relative luciferase activity .
Eectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay-Nuclear extracts were prepared from either Jurkat T cells or NIH3T3 cells using the Andrews procedure and were used in gel shift assays as described ( 22 ) .
Labeling of the oligonucleotide probe was accomplished either by filling the 5° ends using DNA polymerase large fragment ( Klenow ) in the presence of dATP , dGTP , dTTP , and [ « -* `` P ] dCTP ( > 3,000 Ci/mmol ; DuPont NEN ) or by phosphorylation of the oligonucleotide probe at the free 5'-hy-droxyl group using polynucleotide kinase and [ y- `` `` P ] JATP ( > 3,000 Ci/ mmol ; DuPont NEN ) .
Labeled probes were purified by gel electrophore-sis .
A 50-100 molar excess of competitor oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction 15-20 min prior to the probe .
The AP-l-specific oligonucleotide was kindly provided by N. C. Andrews .
Antiserum specific for NFATp and Oct-1 was kindly provided by A. Rao and G. R. Crabtree , respectively .
RESULTS The CBF Site within the Human IL-3 Promoter Is Position sensitive-We previously demonstrated that CBF is necessary for IL-3 promoter activity ( 3 ) .
To further characterize the functional role of CBF , a new site ( CBF* ) was introduced 51 bp upstream of the endogenous location and tested for its capacity to rescue the activity of an IL-3 promoter mutated at the resident CBF site .
These experiments were carried out in the human Jurkat T cell line JKE6.1 .
As indicated in Fig .
14 , there is little promoter activity in unstimulated Jurkat cells 2 D. S. Taylor , unpublished data .

*CBF only partially overcomes CBF ( G-C ) mutation .
A , Jurkat T-cells were transfected with the individual promoter constructs depicted schematically in the lower portion of the panel .
Single base mutations were introduced to create the *CBF site and are indicated in boldface type .
Sixteen hours after transfection cells were mock-stimulated or stimulated with a combination of TPA and ionomycin .

B , nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat T cells .
The nuclear extracts were incubated with the indicated competitor oligonucleotide and an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to either the endogenous CBF site or the newly introduced CBF site ( *CBF ) .
The CBF binding site is indicated by a bracket .
Functional Role of CBF in the Regulation of Interleukin-3 ( -315pL ) .
Upon stimulation with TPA and ionomycin , there is up-regulation of promoter activity , which is significantly reduced by a G-C mutation of the endogenous CBF binding site ( -315/GCpL ) .
Introduction of a second CBF site ( -315*CBFpL ) neither increased the base-line promoter activity nor completely rescued activity of the CBF/GC mutant promoter ( -315*CBF/GCpL ) .
To ensure that the created *CBF site bound the CBF complex , gel shift assays were performed .
Both the CBF and the *CBF sites bind a protein complex with a similar mobility and cross-compete with one another for binding to that complex ( Fig .
1B ) .
Equivalent results were obtained using nuclear extract from both stimulated and unstimulated Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
Since the *CBF site is capable of binding the CBF protein complex , but does not alter promoter activity , the location of the CBF site in the IL-3 promoter appears critical for its biologic activity .
The Act-1 and CBF Sites Form a Functional Unit-The endogenous CBF site within the IL-3 promoter is interesting as it is juxtaposed to another important regulatory element , Act-1 .
Such juxtaposition of CBF and another regulatory site is a recurring motif in other promoter/enhancer elements ( Table II ) , and suggests a functional interdependence between the CBF and Act-1 sites in the context of the IL-3 promoter .
To evaluate the functional interdependence of the Act-1 and CBF sites , a second Act-1/CBF ( AC ) unit , or a mutant thereof , was introduced upstream of the wild type site at nt -180 .
Introduction of either the wild type , or one of several mutants of the AC unit , did not involve the deletion of endogenous nucleotides and resulted in extension of the IL-3 promoter by 34-42 bp .
In contrast to our previous experiments with promoters containing the *CBF site ( -315*CBFpL ) , the AC unit significantly up-regulates promoter activity ( Fig .
2 ) in Jurkat T cells upon stimulation with TPA and ionomycin .
Insertion of this unit also resulted in a tendency to increase the basal ( constitutive/unstimulated ) activity of the IL-3 promoter .
In addition , the inserted AC unit overcomes the inhibition of promoter activity caused by a G-C mutation of the endogenous CBF site .
Mutation of either the Act-1 or CBF component of the AC unit resulted in a sharp decrease in promoter activity .
Thus , in Jurkat T cells the Act-1 and CBF sites function only as a unit ( not individually ) to provide inducible promoter activity .
The AC Unit Is Functional in a Minimal Promoter-Having established the functional interdependence of the Act-1 and CBF sites , we next evaluated its function outside the context of an intact , full-length proximal IL-3 promoter .
To this end , a normal AC unit or an AC unit containing a mutant CBF site was inserted 31 bp upstream of the TATA box in the -61-bp minimal IL-3 promoter .
As seen in Fig .
34 , the minimal promoter has significant activity in unstimulated Jurkat cells compared with the full-length -315-bp proximal IL-3 promoter .
This activity is further augmented by stimulation with TPA and ionomycin , and addition of a complete AC unit increases both basal and stimulated activity of the minimal promoter .
The enhancement in activity was abrogated upon introduction of a G-C mutation to the CBF site .
Thus , the AC unit is functional both in the absence of upstream elements within the IL-3 promoter and within 31 bp of the TATA box .
An AC Unit Is Functional in Heterologous Cells-The activity of the full-length , -315-bp proximal IL-3 promoter is highly tissue restricted .
It is functional only in human T and NK cells ( 2 ) .
Such observed tissue-specific activity may result from specific positive regulation in a permissive cell type , specific inhibition in nonpermissive cells , or a combination thereof .
Previous work in this laboratory identified a T cell-specific complex that , upon activation , binds the 5 ' portion of the Act-1 region , suggesting that the AC unit may contribute to the observed 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Functional Role of CBF in the Regulation of Interleukin-3 14023 TaBL® II CBF adjoins other regulatory sequences CBF binding sites are indicated in bold type .

Act-1 and CBF form a functional unit and overcomes a CBF ( G-C ) mutation .
Jurkat T cells were transfected with the individual promoter constructs depicted schematically on the left portion of the figure .
16 h after transfection cells were mock-stimulated or stimulated with a combination of TPA and ionomycin .
6 h after stimulation luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates .
Data from three independent experiments are presented as outlined in Fig .
1 .
The stimulated wild type IL-3 promoter ( top construct ) is the reference construct in this experiment and has a relative luciferase activity of 1.0. ea Vera selective activity of the IL-3 promoter ( 18 ) .
Therefore , the activity of the minimal IL-3 promoter with , and without , a functional AC unit was compared with the full-length -315-bp IL-3 promoter in heterologous , murine NIH3T3 cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
In contrast to the full-length IL-3 promoter , the minimal IL-3 promoter has significant activity in unstimulated NIH3T3 cells .
The activity of the minimal promoter in these fibroblasts is enhanced approximately 2-fold by the addition of a single AC unit .
The AC unit increases basal ( unstimulated ) promoter activity when upstream of the minimal ( -61 bp ) IL-3 promoter in both Jurkat T-cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) .
However , the AC unit increases the stimulation index ( stimu-lated /unstimulated ) in the context of Jurkat T cells but not NIH3T3 fibroblasts .
By virtue of its inducible positive activity in T cells , the AC unit contributes to the tissue-specific regulation of IL-3 gene expression .
Both the Act-1 and CBF segments of the AC unit bind protein complexes common to nuclear extracts from both Jurkat and NIH3T3 cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
The CBF segment of the AC unit binds a major complex in NIH3T3 cells that migrates and competes identically to the previously identified CBF protein complex present in nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
44 ) .
The more diffuse appearance of this complex in NIHS3T3 cells may result from more than one closely migrating complex and suggests the presence of more than a single isoform of CBF in these cells ( 23 , 24 ) .
The Act-1 region of the AC unit binds to a slowly migrating complex present in both cell types ( Fig .
4B ) .
This band was previously identified in this laboratory as Oct-1 or an Oct-1-like protein .
It is possible that the faster migrating complex that is specifically competed by Act-1 in the Jurkat nuclear extract represents the recently identified E4BP4 protein , NFIL3A ( 25 ) .
A Positive Regulatory Element ( CK3 ) Is Present between nt -180 and nt -207 of the IL-3 Promoter-Insertion of the AC unit into the full-length proximal IL-3 promoter resulted both in elongation of the promoter and a tendency to increase basal ( unstimulated ) promoter as noted in Fig .

To investigate this possibility , the promoter fragment between nt -180 and nt -207 was deleted and replaced with an AC unit .
This region was chosen as it contained no previously identified promoter elements .
As shown in Fig .
5 , constancy of the distance between NIP and other downstream elements of the IL-3 promoter restores a low basal activity of the IL-3 promoter in the presence of an additional AC unit .
Furthermore , mutation of the endogenous CBF is fully rescued in the context of the upstream AC unit ( data not shown ) .
However , deletion of the region between nt -180 and nt -207 causes a decrease in overall promoter activity , suggesting that a previously unidentified positive regulatory element is perturbed in this promoter construct .
To further analyze this region , the activity of a -180-bp IL-3 promoter was compared with the -207 and -315 IL-3 promoter constructs in both Jurkat and NIH3T3 cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
In all experiments performed , regardless of cell type , inclusion of the 27 bp between nt -180 and nt -207 induced a significant increase in promoter activity .
Two Specific Complexes Are Bound by the CK3 Element-The coding strand of DNA between nt -180 and nt -207 bears no homology to known regulatory elements .
However , the noncoding strand contains sequences that are similar , but not identi-cal , to known binding sites for nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , AP-1 , and the 3 ' portion of Act-1 ( Table III ) .
To investigate protein binding to the IL-3 promoter in this region ( CK3 ) , gel shift assays were performed using as a probe both a restriction fragment of the IL-3 promoter containing these nucleotides ( Msel-Sausa ) and a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the nucleotides of interest ( Fig .
7A ) .
Both probes bind a faster migrating complex ( CK3a ) and a slower migrating doublet ( CK3b ) .
The faster migrating protein complex ( CK3a ) is specifically competed by unlabeled `` self `` oligonucleotide and nucleotides containing the complete Act-1 site , but is not competed by an oligonucleotide containing only the 5 portion of the Act-1 site 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 14024 A Fic .

The Act-1/CBF unit enhances transcription activity of a minimal promoter in both Jurkat T cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts .
A , Jurkat T cells were transfected with the indicated promoter constructs and stimulated as described in the legend to Fig .

An AC unit containing either a wild type or mutant CBF binding site was appended to the 5 ' portion of the minimal ( -61 bp ) IL-3 promoter as outlined under `` Materials and Methods `` and compared with the minimal IL-3 promoter .
Data Elfi from five independent experiments are API & _ NI presented as outlined in Fig .

The stim- o ulated minimal ( -61 bp ) promoter ( sec- ond construct ) is the reference construct in this experiment and has a relative lu ciferase activity of 1.0 .
In one of five ex periments the full-length ( -815 bp ) prox- imal IL-3 promoter ( bottom construct ) was included for the purpose of comparison .
B , B murine NIHS3T3 fibroblast cells were transfected with the indicated promoter constructs using the calcium phosphate method .
Cells were grown for 24 h after transfection , then stimulated for 7 h with TPA only as stimulation of NIHST3 cells with a combination of TPA and ionomycin substantially decrease activity of all pro moter constructs .
Cell lysates were iso- lated and assessed for luciferase activity .
Data from four independent experiments are presented as outlined in Fig .

The stimulated minimal ( -61 bp ) promoter ( second construct ) is the reference con struct in this experiment and has a rela- AP1 Ef } tive luciferase activity of 1.0 .
The -173 bp IL-3 promoter construct was present in one of four experiments .
P ( Fig .
7A ) .
Oct-1 is known to bind to the 3 ' portion of the Act-1 site , but antiserum specific for Oct-1 does not supershift CKS8a ( data not shown ) ( 18 ) .
Also , despite similarity to an AP-1 site , the CK3a complex migrates much more rapidly than the AP-1 complex ( Fig .
7A ) and the same AP-1-specific oligonucleotide does not compete for CK3a binding ( Fig .
7B ) .
Protein binding associated with the slower migrating doublet ( CK3b ) is specifically inhibited by unlabeled oligonucleotide containing either the 5 ' portion of the NFAT region of the IL-2 promoter ( IL2NFAT ) or the NFAT-like sequence of the IL-3 promoter ( ILENFAT ) ( Fig .
7B ) .
However , antiserum specific for NFATp does not supershift the CK3b complex ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the CK3 region of the IL-3 promoter identifies proteins that bind DNA with specificities that are similar to , but distinct from , Oct-1 and NFAT .
DISCUSSION IL-3 is a lymphokine important for normal hematopoiesis ( 1 ) .
Its expression is highly tissue-specific , being expressed primarily in T and NK cells ( 2 ) .
Therefore , its promoter has been extensively studied ( 3-6 ) .
Most recently , in vivo footprinting of the IL-3 promoter identified a CBF binding site as one of the few regions specifically protected upon stimulation of T cells ( 3 ) .
The initial characterization of this site indicated that CBF binding to the IL-3 promoter is necessary , but not sufficient , for IL-3 promoter activity ( 8 ) .
The recent identification of mutant CBF proteins created by the t ( 8 ; 21 ) , t ( 3 ; 21 ) , and inv ( 16 ) chromosomal rearrangements and the association of these rearrangements with specific subtypes of AML or MDS has encouraged intense study of the Act !

The presence of a functional CBF site within the IL-3 proximal promoter provided an ideal context in which to more closely evaluate the activity of this important regulatory complex .
The present data demonstrate that the CBF complex can not function alone .
This is supported by the observation that a second CBF binding site ( *CBF ) that binds the CBF complex in a gel shift assay provides neither positive promoter activity nor overcomes a mutation of the endogenous CBF site ( Fig .
1 ) .
In contrast , a CBF site in conjunction with the adjacent Act-1 region of the IL-3 promoter both augments promoter activity and overcomes a null mutation of the endogenous CBF site .
Both effects are abrogated by mutation of either the Act-1 or CBF component of the unit ( Fig .
2 ) .
The AC unit functions similarly in the context of a minimal ( -61 bp ) IL-3 promoter ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , the AC unit is an autologous functional unit that retains its activity outside the context of a full-length IL-3 promoter and requires both the Act-1 and CBF sites to be intact .
The AC unit functions in both human T cells ( Jurkat ) and murine fibroblasts ( NIH3T3 ) , and nuclear extracts from both cell types contain proteins that bind similarly to both the Act-1 and CBF sites of the AC unit ( Fig .
4 ) .
In the context of T cells , the AC unit augments both basal ( constitutive/unstimulated ) and inducible ( stimulated ) promoter activity .
However , the augmentation of inducible promoter activity in T cells is greater than the augmentation of basal activity as indicated by an increase in the stimulation index of an IL-3 promoter containing a second AC unit ( Figs .
2 and 3 ) .

Thus , the AC unit contributes to the tissue-specific expression of IL-3 by its selective positive contribution to inducible promoter activity in the context of T cells .

Replacement of IL-3 promoter between nt -180 and nt -207 decreases promoter activity .
Jurkat T cells were transfected with the indicated promoter constructs and stimulated as described in Fig .
1 .
The NAC constructs contain a second AC unit and flanking nucleotides that replaces the endogenous IL-3 promoter between nt -207 and nt -180 .
Data from two independent experiments are presented as outlined in Fig .
1 .
The stimulated wild type -315-bp IL-3 promoter ( second construct ) is the reference construct in this experiment and has a relative luciferase activity of 1.0. factors , it may involve alteration in DNA configuration via bending ( 27 ) .
Alternatively , CBF may function as a chaperon protein and augment/inhibit binding of other proteins to the promoter .
For example , several isoforms of CBF have been identified and found to have variable activity in vitro ( 24 , 28 ) .
Thus , the capacity of CBF to modulate the association between other proteins , such as the Act-l-binding proteins , and DNA may be dependent on the relative amount of the various CBF isoforms under various conditions .
Previous in vivo footprinting of the IL-3 promoter is consistent with this hypothesis .
These data demonstrate protection of the CBF site only upon stimulation , despite similar amounts of CBF binding activity in nuclear extracts obtained from either stimulated or unstimulated Jurkat cells ( 38 ) .
This hypothesis is further supported by recent data that demonstrate a similar functional interdependence between PEBP2a @ , the murine homologue of CBF , and Ets-1 , which binds an adjacent regulatory element in the T cell receptor a chain enhancer ( 29 ) .
Although the AC unit contributes to the specific up-regulation of the IL-3 promoter activity in T cells , as evidenced by its effect on a minimal promoter , the full-length ( -315 bp ) IL-3 promoter is not active in fibroblasts .
Therefore , additional elements between nt -61 and nt -315 of the IL-3 promoter contribute to tissue-specific promoter activity by limiting activity in non-T cells .
As suggested by our results in Fig .
3B , there are at least two elements that inhibit IL-3 promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells .
One element resides between nt -173 and nt -315 ( Fig .
3B ) .
The presence of this upstream region of the IL-3 promoter is also associated with a low basal activity of the promoter in Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
34 ) .
The NIP site of the IL-3 promoter is located at nt -266 , is a negative regulator of transcription , and has been extensively studied in this laboratory ( 5 , 30 ) .

The combined effect of these two negative elements is abrogation of IL-3 promoter activity in the context of NIHST3 cells .
The second observation resulting from the study of the AC unit , and immediately relevant to IL-3 promoter function , is the identification of a previously unknown positive regulatory IL3CK8a IL3CK3b region between nt -180 and nt -207 ( Fig .
6 ) .

Preliminary characterization of -180/-207 re-NFIL2E ( -282NFAT ) GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCAT gion by gel shift analysis demonstrates that at least two protein GM550 ( NFAT-AP1 ) GAAAGGAGCAAAGCAAGAGTCAT complexes bind independently to this region .
Although there IL3 CK3b GAAACAAGAAAAAAGA ( nucleotide -288 ) elements is intriguing .
The latter two regions are known positive regulators of promoter activity , and EIf-1 has been implicated in the specific positive regulation of the IL-3 promoter in T cells ( 4 ) .
Thus , the AP-1-EIf-1-NIP complex may represent a second example within the IL-3 promoter of a functional interdependence between adjacent regulatory regions .
A second element is present between nt -61 and nt -173 .
This element functionally negates the positive contribution of the endogenous AC unit , which is evidenced by a decrease in activity of the -173-bp promoter as compared with the -61-bp promoter containing an AC unit .
A highly con are sequence similarities between the noncoding strand of this region and the Act-1/Oct-1 , AP-1 , and NFATp sites , preliminary experiments suggest that these factors are not involved in binding to these 27 nucleotides .
In addition to Oct-1 , the E4BP4 protein , NFIL3 , binds to the 3 ' portion of the Act-1 site ( 6 , 33 ) .
Although the 3 ' portion of the Act-1 site is important for competition of CKS3a binding , the sequence of the CK8a site contains only 5 ( G'-ATTAC- ) of 10 nucleotides that define the EABP4 consensus site ( 25 ) .
Antiserum specific for the NFIL3 protein is not available , so the relationship between EABPA4/ NFIL3 and the observed binding at the CK38a region is unknown at this time .
Regardless , a more complete mutational analysis of this region will be necessary to confirm that the protein complexes identified by this gel shift analysis are as 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Functional Role of CBF in the Regulation of Interleukin-3 A i- ut < ta P a 2 5 9 u .

sociated with the positive regulatory activity .
These studies are in progress .
In conclusion , we demonstrate that the Act-1 and CBF sites 14027 of the IL-3 promoter form a functional unit .
We further demonstrate that the tissue-specific activity of the proximal IL-3 promoter results from the combined activity of this unit and other regulatory elements within the promoter rather than from a single , tissue-specific protein .
The contribution of the Act-1/CBF unit to this activity is important as it mediates inducible promoter activity in the context of T cells ( but not fibroblasts ) .
It remains important to determine how , or whether , mutant forms of the CBF protein , relevant to AML and MDS , alter this tissue-specific activity .
However , the recognized association of the M4Eo subtype of AML with both a mutation in the B-chain of CBF and eosinophilia indirectly suggests that IL-3 , a positive regulator of eosinophil differen-tiation , is abnormally up-regulated in these cells .
