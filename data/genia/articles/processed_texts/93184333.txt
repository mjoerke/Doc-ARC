Human CD4 Lymphocytes Specifically Recognize a Peptide Representing the Fusion Region of the Hybrid Protein pml/RARa « Present in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Cells By Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini , Francesco Grignani , Flavio Arienti , Pier Paolo Pandolfi , Pier Giuseppe Pelicci , and Giorgio Parmiani Fusion proteins present in leukemic cells frequently contain a new amino acid at the fusion point .
We tested whether a peptide ( BCR1/25 ) encompassing the fusion region of the hybrid molecule pml/RARa , which is selectively expressed by acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) cells , can be recognized by human T lymphocytes in vitro .
CD4* lympho-cytes , at both polyclonal and clonal level , recognized peptide BCR1/25 in an HLA-DR-restricted fashion on presentation by autologous antigen-presenting cell ( APC ) or by APC expressing the HLA-DR11 restricting molecule .
Control peptides corresponding to the normal pml and RAR proteins SPECIFIC 15:17 chromosomal translocation is present in 80 % to 90 % of cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . ``
One product of this translocation , which is considered to play a major role in promyelocyte transformation , is represented by a hybrid protein in which the product of the third exon of the RARa gene , located on chromosome 17 , is fused to the amino terminal portion of another Zn finger protein named pml .
`` ~ Although different types of fusion are present , one of them ( named ber1 ) is most frequently observed in APL cells .
* The fusion protein resulting from this translocation thus contains two sets of amino acids that normally do not belong to the same protein .
In particular , the amino acid corresponding to the fusion point ( Ala ) differs from the corresponding ones on both the normal RARa ( Thr ) and pml ( Glu ) proteins .
* `` The reason for this `` new `` amino acid derives from the hybrid nature of the triplet ( GCC ) of bases coding for that amino acid , with one base ( G ) donated by the pml gene and the two others ( CC ) originating from RARa « .
It is known that a single amino acidic difference is sufficient to generate a new antigenic site `` ; therefore , the ber| type of the pml/RARa « fusion protein could contain a new antigenic site , absent from the two normal parent proteins that originate the fusion molecule .
It is also known that antigens are presented to T lymphocytes in the form of small peptides associated with HLA class I or II molecules . ``
'' `` To test the hypothesis that the pral/RAR « a protein contains a new antigen recognized by T cells , a 25-mer peptide ( BCR1/ 25 ) , encompassing the fusion point of the pml/RARa « fusion protein ( berl type ) , was synthesized , purified by high-per-formance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) , and used to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) obtained from healthy donors .
We report here that human CD4 lymphocytes can specifically recognize in an HLA-restricted way both peptide BCR 1/ 25 and autologous cells expressing the berl type pml/RARa fusion protein in vitro .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Peptides .
- The peptides used in this study are the following : BCR1/ 25 , NSNHVASGAGEAAIETQSSSSEEIV ; BCR3 , ITQGKAIE-TQSSSSEEIV ; pml , NSNHVASGAGEAEERVVVISSSED ; ras , KLVVVGAGGVGK ; b3 , SATGFKQSSKALQRPVASD .

One clone ( DEGS ) also exerted a high and specific cytotoxicity against autologous cells pulsed with BCR1/25 .
The autologous DE LCL containing a trans-duced pmI/RAR « fusion gene and expressing a beri type of the pmi { i/RARa « hybrid protein induced the proliferation of DE anti-BCR1/25 T cell clones .
It is concluded that the beri type-pmi/RARa « fusion protein of APL contains an antigenic site , absent from the normal parent molecules and recognized by human CD4* lymphocytes .

represent the fusion region of the pmIl/RARa protein ( BCR 1/25 and BCR3 , in which the same RARa-derived sequence joins a different pml sequence ) and of the ber/abl ( b3 ) protein ( an unrelated fusion protein present in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells ) .
The remaining peptides represent part of the normal pml protein ( pm ! )
corresponding to the fusion region of the berl -type pml/RARa protein or part of a mutated ras protein ( ras ) .
The peptides were synthesized at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center , Madison , WI , or by Neosystem SA , Strasbourg , France , and purified by HPLC to a minimum purity of 95 % .
Single impurities never exceeded 1 % .
( The sequences of these peptides were derived from references 4 , 5 , 11 , and 12 ) .
PBMC .
- PBMC were obtained from peripheral blood by centrif-ugation on Ficoll gradients and immediately used or frozen .
Lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCL ) .
PBMC ( 10 ' cells ) were incubated overnight with 3 mL of the supernatant from the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -producing line B95.8 ( a gift of Dr Paul Sondel , Madison , WI ) and cultured in RPMI + 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) .
Cyclosporine ( 2 ug/mL ) was added to the cultures during the first month .
LCL were used after 2 months of culture .
DR phenotype of LCL .
- This assay was performed on polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -amplified DNA samples by using sequence-specific oligonucleotides . ``
Production of a pml/RARa retroviral vector and infection of DE LCL cells .
A pml/RARa clone from position 652 to position 3101 of the published sequence* was inserted into the £EcoR 1 site of the plasmid LXSN'* to produce the retroviral plasmid pLSPRSN .
In this clone the reading frame starts from ATG codon at position 715 and ends at the TGA stop codon at position 2854 , encoding a protein with the expected molecular weight of 78.8 Kd .

1370 the pmIl/RARa fusion protein , including the pmIl/RARa junction sequence from which the peptide BCR1/25 used in this study was derived .
The production of a helper-free retroviral vector was previously described . ``
Briefly , the PLSPRSN plasmid was transfected into W2 cells . ``
After 48 hours the W2 cell medium containing the ecotropic virus was collected and used to infect the amphotropic packaging cell line PA317 . ``
'' The infected PA317 cells were selected in 300 ug/ mL G418 and subcloned by limiting dilution .
The clones were analyzed for the production of the correct mRNA and protein by Northern and Western blotting ( data not shown ) .
The virus production titers of the clones expressing the expected protein were measured by infecting the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS ( obtained from American Type Culture Collection [ ATCC ] , Rockville , MD ) .
A PA317 clone producing the control LXSN vector was also generated with the same procedure .
High-titer clones of LSPRSN and LXSN were used to infect target cells .
The DE LCL target cells were infected with one three-hour infection cycle per day for 3 days .
After 24 hours from the last infection , the cells were selected in 600 ug/mL G418 .
Two cell lines were obtained and named DE/PR ( infected with LSPRSN ) and DE/SN ( infected with LXSN ) .
The production of the PML/RAR by the infected cells was assayed by Western blotting .
Western blotting .
- The preparation of cell lysates and the methods for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were previously described .
'* Thirty micrograms of total cell protein were resolved in each sample .
The blots were probed with an anti-RARa domain F rabbit antiserum `` ( a gift from Dr P Chambon , Strasbourg , France ) , and developed with alkaline phos-phatase-conjugated secondary antibody ( Promega , Madison , WI ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
DR transfectants .
- Murine fibroblasts transfected with human DR genes were a gift from Dr R. Karr , Monsanto Inc , St Louis , MO , `` and from Dr Julia Bodmer , ICRF , London , England .
They were cultured in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium containing 10 % FCS , 20 mmol/L L-glutamine , and 250 ug/mL G418 .
The expression of DR molecules on murine fibroblasts was assessed by indirect im-munofluorescence with D1-12 MoAb and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis .
In vitro activation .
- PBMC were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom plates ( 10° cells/well ) in RPMI plus 5 % human serum ( HS ) and stimulated with 10° autologous antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) pulsed with BCR 1/25 ( 2 umol/L final concentration ) .
The number of wells seeded for each donor ranged from 384 to 672 .
PBMC were used as APC ; they were preincubated in serum-free RPMI with peptide at 20 amol/ L for 2 hours and then added to the wells .
Recombinant interleukin-2 ( rIL-2 , 10 U/mL , corresponding to 60 IU/mL ; EuroCetus BV , Am-sterdam , The Netherlands ) was added after 4 to 5 days and the percent of HS was increased to 10 % .
This activation cycle was repeated after L0 and 20 days of culture using irradiated ( 400 cGy ) APC ( XR APC ) .
After the third cycle of stimulation , each plate , containing 2 to 5 % 10° cells/well , was split into three plates , two of which were restimulated with peptide-pulsed APC , and the third ( control plate ) with APC alone .
After 48 hours of culture , one of the plates restimulated with the peptide and the control plate were labeled with 'HTdR , further cultured for 18 hours , and harvested .
Positive wells were identified as those in which the counts per minute were > 2 times the counts per minute in the control wells in two consecutive experiments .
Lymphocyte clones .
- Polyclonal lines were cloned by limiting dilution ( 1 cell/well ) in 96-well plates ( U bottom ) , in the presence of autologous peptide pulsed ( 2 umol/L final concentration ) XR-APC and rIL-2 ( 50 Cetus U/mL , corresponding to 300 IU/mL ) .
The growing clones were restimulated every 7 to 10 days with the same protocol used for polyclonal lines ( autologous XR , 800 cGy , EBV-transformed LCL were used as feeder cells ) .
The probability of clonality for each GAMBACORTI-PASSERINI ET AL well containing growth ( P clone ) was calculated according to the following formula® `` : P clone = XF x - where X is the number of cells seeded in each well and F is the frequency of clonogenic precursors that represents the slope of the regression curve obtained by plotting the In of the percent of negative wells against the number of cells seeded per well .
Proliferative response to peptides .
T-cell clones ( 4 to 5 X 104 well ) were cultured for 48 hours with autologous irradiated ( 800 cGy ) LCLs ( 10°/well ) + BCR1/25 or control peptides , incubated for additional 18 hours with °HTdR ( 1 uCi/well ) , and harvested .
For blocking experiments , MoAbs were added to the wells containing the XR-LCL immediately before the addition of the lymphocytes .
Anti-CD3 ( OKT3 , from ATCC ) was used as a purified antibody , whereas anti-HLA class I ( W6/32 , from ATCC ) or II ( anti-DR , Di-12 , a gift from Dr R. Accolla , Verona , Italy ) MoAbs were in the form of diluted ascites .
Cytotoxic assay .
This assay was performed as previously described . ``
Target cells were labeled with Na® `` CrO , , washed , and seeded into 96-well microplates in the presence of lymphocyte clones at different effector/target ( E/T ) ratios ( 20 , 10 , 5 , and 2.5/1 ) in a final volume of 200 gL .
The plates were then centrifuged and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C .
After incubation , 100 gL supernatant was collected and counted in a B-counter .
Spontaneous release never exceeded 14 % .
For blocking experiments , various concentrations ( 10 to 0.01 ug/mL ) or dilutions of MoAbs directed against CD3 HLA class I or II molecules were added to the targets before mixing targets and effector cells .
In control wells , irrelevant mouse Ig was added .
RESULTS Polyclonal lines .
A specific proliferation to peptide BCR1/25 was observed in 4/5 donors , with 0.8 % to 3 % of positive wells and stimulation indexes ( stimulation index [ SI ] , counts per minute test well/counts per minute control well ) ranging from 2.1 to 16.1 .
These polyclonal lines were predominantly CD4* or were a mixture of CD4 and CD8-y/é lymphocytes .
No line showed specific cytotoxicity against peptide-pulsed APC ( not shown ) .
Proliferative response of lymphocyte clones .
- Five lines from donor DE were cloned by limiting dilution ( 1 cell/well ) .
The probability of clonality for the growing wells ranged from 91 % to 99.2 % , depending on the line of origin and the relative cloning efficiency .
Among the 186 clones obtained , 59 showed specific proliferation to BCR1/25 in a first experiment ( SI 4.6-61 ) .
Fifty-one clones ( 86 % ) confirmed this specific response in a second experiment in which a dose-response curve was also obtained .
Twelve clones were selected for further analysis .
All clones show the following phenotype : CD3 # , CD4* , T-cell Receptor ( TCR ) a/8* , CD87 , TCR 7/87 .
Figure 1 shows that proliferation occurred in all six representative clones at peptide concentrations between 200 nmol/L and 2 umol/L .
Counts per minute values further increased at higher concentrations and reached a plateau at 20 umol/L ( data not shown ) .
The specificity of this response was analyzed .
DE clones were stimulated with XR-APC pulsed with BCR1/25 or peptides corresponding to the normal pml , a different pml/RAR « fusion peptide ( BCR3 ) in which the same part of RARa « is fused to a different part of pral ( more NH terminal than in the beri type ) , or a mutated ras peptide .

recognize BCR 1/25 , whereas they are unable to react to peptides corresponding to the normal pml or to the normal RARa ( peptide BCR3 ) proteins or against a ras peptide previously shown to be immunogenic in vitro . '
'' No response was also observed against b3 , a 19-mer ber/abl fusion peptide ( data not shown ) .
The HLA restriction of DE clones was subsequently investigated by blocking experiments using MoAbs against CD3 , HLA class I and II molecules .
Figure 3 shows that anti-CD3 or -HLA class II ( DR ) molecule MoAbs significantly inhibited the proliferative response to BCR1/25 in all the clones tested .
No significant inhibition was caused by these MoAbs at the concentrations used in these experiments when rIL-2 was used as proliferative stimulus ( data not shown ) .
The ability of two allogeneic LCLs to present BCR1/25 to DE clones was also investigated to define more precisely the DR restriction molecule involved .
LE cells ( DR 1,3 ) , sharing no DR molecule with DE ( DR 11 and 13 ) , failed to present BCR 1/25 .
Cells from donor VG ( DR 11 and 7 ) , who shared DR 11 with DE , induced proliferation of DE clones when pulsed with BCR1/25 ( data not shown ) , suggesting the involvement of HLA-DR 11 in the response of DE T clones to BCR 1/25 .
This hypothesis was tested using murine fibroblasts transfected with HLA-DR genes and known to express their encoded molecules .
`` !
Figure 4 shows that line L91.7 ( DR 11 transfectant ) was able to present BCR 1/25 to clones C6 , G2 , and G10 , whereas lines R 3.2.1 ( DR4 transfectant ) and L182 .
1 ( DR 14 transfectant ) failed to stimulate DE clones .
No HLA-DR 13 transfectant was available to us .
These results indicate that DR11 is the dominant restriction element for at least clones C6 , G2 , and G10 .

1374 ically recognized by the immune system .
The absence of reactivity toward peptides corresponding to the same regions of the normal pml and RARa proteins rules out the possibility that these clones are just recognizing a portion of a normal protein ; instead it shows that the fusion process itself is generating this specificity .
Experiments performed with the DE/ PR cell line expressing the pml/RARa « hybrid protein show that peptide BCR 1/25 or a cross-reacting peptide is produced during the intracellular processing of the pmi/RARa « protein in the DE/PR LCL cells .
Although intracellular proteins are believed to be mainly presented by HLA class I molecules , `` they can also be presented by HLA class II molecules , `` as exemplified in our experiments .
However , the possible release of pml|/RARa protein in the cell culture medium , with the subsequent uptake and intracellular processing and presentation of the endocytosed protein associated with HLA class II molecules can not be excluded .
The concentration of peptide BCR1/25 necessary to induce the proliferation of lymphocytes is higher than that required in other experimental systems . ``
This can be caused by the different strength of the antigen or by the low affinity of in vitro-activated lympho-cytes . ``
APL cells are sensitive to cytotoxic drugs and to the differentiating action of retinoic acid ( RA ) .
However , less than 50 % of APL patients are cured by standard treatment and RA-induced remissions seem to be short-lived . ``
Therefore , new treatment modalities are needed in this disease .
The use of pml/RARa « and other fusion proteins as targets for specific immunotherapy is attractive for two main reasons : ( 1 ) these proteins are selectively expressed in neoplastic cells and , therefore , their use as immunogens should not induce autoimmunity ; ( 2 ) the pml/RARa « fusion proteins are linked to the process of malignant transformation ; therefore the selection of antigen-negative leukemic cells should not constitute a major problem .
The number of human molecules that can function as specific tumor antigen is now expanding .
Jung et al showed that peptides from the mutated ras protein can be specifically recognized in vitro by donor T lymphocytes .
`` !
Van der Bruggen et al identified a set of human genes that code for molecules recognized by human antimelanoma T-cell clones . ``
More recently , Chen et al showed that peptides from the ber/abl protein , when injected in mice , can induce a specific T-cell response . ``
Many aspects need to be investigated further and dissected before the clinical use of these peptides can be considered for human immunotherapy , whose results are still unsatis-factory .
`` * `` In our case , we do not know whether this response can be obtained with lymphocytes from APL patients , or whether a similar peptide is naturally produced in vivo by APL cells .
Although we showed that the pml/RARa « fusion protein could induce a class II-mediated immune response , we ignore whether class -associated pml/RARa « peptides can be produced and mediate cellular cytotoxicity against APL cells .
Some of these issues are presently being investigated in our laboratory .
However , these data indicate that a tumor-specific molecule closely involved in the process of leukemogenesis can be specifically recognized by human T lymphocytes .
