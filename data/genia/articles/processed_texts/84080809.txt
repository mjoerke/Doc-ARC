Effect of Cell Cycle Position on Dexamethasone Binding by Mouse and Human Lymphoid Cell Lines : Correlation Between an Increase in Dexamethasone Binding During S Phase and Dexamethasone Sensitivity Clark W. Distelhorst , Barbara M. Benutto , and Robert A. Bergamini We determined the effect of cell cycle position on the amount of dexamethasone that was specifically bound by mouse and human lymphoid cell lines .
Cell lines that were either sensitive or resistant to growth inhibition by dexamethasone were compared .
Exponentially growing cells were separated by centrifugal elutriation into fractions that corresponded to different positions in the cell cycle .
The cell cycle phase distribution of each fraction was estimated by flow cytometry and autoradiography .
The amount of dexamethasone bound per cell in each fraction was measured by a whole cell binding assay .
In three dexamethasone-sensitive cell lines ( two mouse and one human ) , we found that the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell increased 2-4-fold between G , phase and S phase , and then decreased during G , /M phase .
Results were the same when the amount of dexamethasone bound HE EFFECTS of glucocorticosteroids on cells are mediated through the binding of steroid molecules to specific receptor proteins located in the cytoplasm of target cells . '
Steroid-receptor complexes translocate to the nucleus of the cell , where they interact with chromatin to modulate gene expression .
In many cells , glucocorticoids induce the synthesis of specific proteins . ``
In lymphoid cells , the effects of glucocorticoids are mainly inhibitory , resulting in growth inhibition and cell death . ``
By studying glucocorticoid resistant mutants of the $ 49 mouse lymphoma cell line , Tompkins and coworkers found that a variety of glucocorticoid receptor defects were responsible for the development of glucocorticoid resistance . ``
The defective receptor mutants were grouped into four phenotypic categories : receptor-activity-deficient mutants , nuclear-transfer-deficient mutants , nuclear-transfer-increased mutants , and the so-called `` death-less `` mutants , which appeared to be normal in their steroid ( and nuclear ) binding characteristics .
More recent studies have been directed toward understanding the structure of the glucocorticoid receptor ' and have uncovered structural defects in the receptor that account for the nuclear-transfer-increased type of glucocorticoid resistance .
** One poorly understood property of glucocorticoid receptors involves the changes that appear to occur during the cell cycle .
Recently , Cidlowski and Michaels ' demonstrated that the number of glucocorticoid receptors in HeLa cells , measured by the specific binding of dexamethasone , increased 2-3-fold during Blood , Vol .

105-113 per milligram of cell protein was measured .
Binding affinity was the same during G , phase and S phase , but the proportion of bound dexamethasone that translocated to the nucleus was greater during S phase .
In contrast , we found that the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell by three dexamethasone-resistant cell lines ( two mouse and one human ) did not increase during S phase .
Our results indicate that cell cycle changes in dexamethasone binding are not simply related to changes in cell protein or cell volume during the cell cycle .
An increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase may be required for dexamethasone to inhibit cell growth , and a failure of dexamethasone binding to increase during S phase might represent a new mechanism of dexamethasone resistance in lymphoid cells .
S phase .
Other investigators showed that the amount of dexamethasone bound by circulating human lym-phocytes increased after the cells were stimulated by mitogens . ``
Crabtree et al . ``
'' proposed that this phenomenon was due to the presence of a greater number of dexamethasone receptors in S phase cells than in G , and G , phase cells .
In the present study , we determined the effect of cell cycle position on dexamethasone binding by both dexamethasone-sensitive and -resistant lymphoid cell lines .
Human and mouse lymphoid cell lines were separated by centrifugal elutriation into fractions corresponding to different positions in the cell cycle , and the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell in each fraction was measured simultaneously .
The results show a correlation between an increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase and dexamethasone sensitivity .

106 MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials [ 1,2,4- > H ] -Dexamethasone ( 42 Ci/mmole ) was purchased from Amersham Corp. ( Arlington Heights , IL ) ; { methyl-H ] } -thymidine ( 2.0 Ci/mmole ) was obtained from New England Nuclear ( Boston , MA ) .
Dexamethasone , chromomycin A3 , Nonidet P-40 , and other chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. ( St. Louis , MO ) .
NTB-2 nuclear track emulsion and D19 developer were from Eastman Kodak , Inc. ( Rochester , NY ) .
Culture medium was obtained from the Center for Basic Cancer Research at Washington University , and newborn calf serum was purchased from KC Biological , Inc. ( Lenexa , KS ) .
Cell Lines The IM-9 cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) .
The 8226 cell line was from Dr. Robert Allen ( American Red Cross , St. Louis , MO ) .
The $ 49 W+ 24.32 cell line was provided by Dr. Vincent Groppi ( University of California , San Francisco , CA ) .
The $ 49 variants and WEHI7 M4.12 ( abbre-viated W7 ) cell lines were given to us by Dr. Keith Yamamoto ( University of California , San Francisco , CA ) .
Cell Cultures $ 49 and W7 cell lines were grown in stationary suspension culture in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DME ) with 3 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated newborn calf serum and were maintained at 37°C in a 10 % CO ; atmosphere .
The IM-9 and 8226 cell lines were grown in stationary suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10 % heat-inactivated newborn calf serum and were maintained at 37°C in a 5 % CO ; atmosphere .
Centrifugal Elutriation Exponentially dividing cells were separated on the basis of cell size by centrifugal elutriation .
The method was modified after that of Kaiser et al . '
'' and has been described in detail elsewhere . ``
Briefly , cell separation was performed in a Beckman J2-21 centrifuge equipped with an elutriation rotor and standard elutriation chamber .
Cells were suspended in the same medium used in cell culture and loaded into the separatory chamber at a flow rate of 9 ml/min for $ 49 and W7 cell lines and 7 ml/min for IM-9 and 8226 cell lines .
Maximum cell load was 4 x 10° cells .
Rotor speed was maintained at 2,000 rpm for $ 49 and W7 cell lines and 1,600 rpm for 8226 and IM-9 cell lines .
Cells were collected in 200-ml fractions by stepwise 2 ml/min increments in the rate of flow of medium through the chamber .
Cells were counted with a hemocytometer , and cell viability was determined by the ability of cells to exclude trypan blue dye .
Flow Cytometry Cells were fixed with 25 % ethanol and 15 mM MgCi ; at 4°C , stained with chromomycin A3 , and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the population distribution of DNA content per cell . ``
Flow cytometry was performed in the Flow Cytometry Laboratory at Washington University , using a Becton-Dickinson Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter ( FACS IV ) .
The G ; , S , and G , /M phase content of each population was quantified by the computer modeling program described by Dean and Jett . ``
' H-Thymidine Incorporation and Autoradiography Cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 hr with 1.5 gCi/ml H-thymidine , and acid-precipitable radioactivity was measured by DISTELHORST , BENUTTO , AND BERGAMINI previously described methods . ``
Autoradiographs of *H-thymidine-labeled cells , placed on microscope slides with a cytocentrifuge , were prepared exactly as described by Stein and Yanishevsky , `` `` using NTB-2 nuclear track emulsion and an exposure time of 5 days .
At least 600 cells were counted on each slide .
Cell Volume The size distribution of cell populations was determined in a model ZBI Coulter counter equipped with a multichannel analyzer ( Channelyzer II , Coulter Electronics , Hialeah , FL ) .
Dexamethasone Binding Dexamethasone binding was measured simultaneously on all fractions isolated by centrifugal elutriation , and the cell concentration of each fraction was adjusted so that binding was measured on an equal number of cells in each fraction .
Binding of dexamethasone was measured using a whole cell competitive binding technique , modified after that described previously . ``
$ 49 and W7 cells were washed twice and suspended in DME buffered with 25 mM HEPES .
Cell suspensions were transferred to 16 x 100 mm sterile glass culture tubes at a concentration of 2-5 x 10° cells/tube .
Cells were gently pelleted and resuspended in 0.6 ml of DME .
To each 0.6-ml cell suspension was added 0.4 ml of DME containing sufficient ' H-dexamethasone to give a final dexamethasone concentration of from 2.5 nM to 120 nM .
Unlabeled dexamethasone was added to an identical set of tubes , in addition to the ' H-dexamethasone , so that the concentration of dexamethasone was 3 uM .
In most experiments , binding was measured at a single concentration of *H-dexametha-sone ( 30 nM , which is sufficient to saturate most receptor sites ) , in the presence or absence of 3 uM unlabeled dexamethasone .
The cell suspensions were covered loosely and incubated in a 10 % CO , atmosphere at 37°C , with periodic gentle shaking .
Incubations were terminated after 2 hr by the addition of 3 ml ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , pH 7.4 , and pelleting the cells at 800 g for 2 min at 4°C .
The supernatant was then discarded , and the cell pellet was resuspended in DME .
The cell suspensions were incubated at 25°C for 5 min and then the incubation was stopped by the addition of 3 ml ice-cold PBS .
The cells were pelleted at 800 g for 2 min at 4°C and then washed once again with 3 ml ice-cold PBS .
After the final wash , cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml ethanol with vigorous vortexing .
The cell suspensions were counted in 3a70 ; the counting efficiency was 55 % .
Binding at each concentration of *H-dexametha-sone was measured in triplicate .
Specific binding was defined as binding of ' H-dexamethasone in the absence of unlabeled dexamethasone minus the binding of ' H-dexamethasone in the presence of unlabeled dexamethasone .
Scatchard plots of the binding data were drawn by linear regression analysis .
Binding of dexamethasone by IM-9 and 8226 cells was measured using the same method , except that cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 buffered with 25 m¥ HEPES , and the incubation temperature was 25°C .
The binding conditions employed were found in preliminary studies to be optimal for each cell line studied .
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractionation In order to determine the amount of specifically bound dexamethasone that was localized to nucleus and cytoplasm , cells were fractionated by a modification of the method of Berger and Cooper . ``
The binding procedure described above was followed , but after the final wash , cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS at 4°C .
After 0.1 mi of cell suspension was removed for measurement of whole cell binding , the cells were pelleted at 800 g for 2 min at 4°C .
The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of modified reticulocyte standard buffer { ( modified RSB : 0.1 Mf Tris-chloride at pH 7.4 , 0.01 ¥f NaCl , 0.0015 M Mg acetate ) and underlayered with I ml of RSB containing 1 % From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

The cell suspension was centrifuged at 2,200 rpm at 4°C for 15 min , and then 1.5 ml of supernatant was removed and counted in 3270 to determine cytoplasmic binding .
The peliet was suspended in 1 ml ethanol and counted in 3a70 to determine nuclear binding .
Nuclei were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and found to be intact and free of cytoplasmic rem-nants .
Protein Measurement Protein was measured by the Coomassie brilliant blue method described by Bradford `` ( Bio-Rad protein assay , Bio-Rad Laborato-ries , Richmond , CA ) using crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard .
RESULTS Characterization of Cell Lines Three clones of the $ 49 mouse lymphoma cell line were studied ( Table 1 ) .
$ 49 W* 24.32 is a `` wild type `` clone , whose growth is inhibited by concentrations of dexamethasone as low as 0.01 uM .
$ 49 143R is a dexamethasone-resistant mutant that has an increased nuclear transfer of dexamethasone-receptor complexes .
S49 22R is a dexamethasone-resistant mutant that has a decreased nuclear transfer of dexamethasone , receptor complexes .
The whole cell dexamethasone binding capacity of the sensitive and resistant clones is similar .
The derivation and biochemical characteristics of the $ 49 mutants have been described in detail previously . ``
The M4.12 cell line is a dexamethasone-sensitive clone of the W7 mouse thymoma cell line .
Two human B-lymphoid cell lines were studied , 8226 and IM-9 .
After screening a number of human lymphoid cell lines for dexamethasone sensitivity , these two cell lines were selected for study because of a clear difference in the effect of dexamethasone on cell growth .
The growth of the 8226 cell line is inhibited by dexamethasone , but the growth of the IM-9 cell line is 107 not inhibited by dexamethasone .
The relatively high dexamethasone binding capacity of the IM-9 cell line and its resistance to growth inhibition by dexamethasone have been reported previously by others . ``
Cell Separation Exponentially growing , unsynchronized cells were reproducibly separated according to size by centrifugal elutriation .
Each fraction was analyzed for cell size distribution and for DNA content .
As shown in Fig .
1 , cells in each fraction had a narrow size distribution when compared to the original , asynchronous cell population .
Modal cell volume increased with each fraction and approximately doubled between fractions 1 and 6 .
The distribution of DNA content per cell was measured by flow cytometry ( Fig .
1 ) .
Each fraction corresponded to a different position in the cell cycle from G , phase ( fraction 1 ) , to G , + early S phase ( fractions 2 and 3 ) , to mid-S phase ( fraction 4 ) , to late S + G , phase ( fractions 5 and 6 ) .
The experiment shown in Fig .
1 is typical of the type of separation that was achieved with each cell line .
The cell cycle phase distribution of cells in each fraction was estimated by computer analysis of flow cytometry data .
In some of the experiments , the percentage of cells in S phase was also measured by autoradiography of ' H-thymidine-labeled cells .
As shown in Fig .
2 , the correspondence between the percentage of cells in S phase determined by analysis of DNA histograms and by autoradiography is imper-fect .
The percentage of cells in S phase estimated from DNA histograms was lower than that determined by autoradiography during the G , to S phase transition ( fractions 2 and 3 ) .
At the transition from S to G , /M phase ( fractions 4 and 5 ) , the percentage of cells in S Table 1 .

Dexamethasone binding and percentage S phase cells were measured at periodic time intervals thereafter .
As shown in Fig .

The increase in S phase cells was accompanied by a significant increase in the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell .
The failure of dexamethasone binding to change during the cell cycle in the IM-9 cell line was confirmed by experiments in which cells were synchronized by double thymidine blockade ( not shown ) .

DISCUSSION The present study demonstrates that dexamethasone binding by dexamethasone-sensitive lymphoid cell lines increases 2-4-fold during the S phase of the cell cycle .
The S phase increase in dexamethasone binding was not accompanied by a change in the affinity of receptors for dexamethasone but was accompanied by a small but significant increase in the proportion of dexamethasone-receptor complexes translocated to the nucleus of the cell .
Dexamethasone binding appeared to increase early in S phase and to decline in late S and G , /M phases .
In contrast to the results obtained with dexamethasone-sensitive cell lines , the amount of dexamethasone bound by three dexamethasone-resistant cell lines did not change significantly during the cell cycle .
The correlation between sensitivity to growth inhibition by dexamethasone and an S phase increase in dexamethasone binding suggests that an S phase increase in dexamethasone binding might be necessary in order for dexamethasone to inhibit cell growth .
That a change in dexamethasone binding of the magnitude observed here might be functionally important is supported by previous work by other investigators .
First , studies of $ 49 mouse lymphoma cell hybrids showed that a 111 twofold reduction in dexamethasone binding was associated with a twofold reduction in cell killing by dexamethasone . ``
Second , derivatives of the W7 mouse thymoma cell line , which have about half of the receptor content of the parental cell line , are more resistant than the parental cell line to dexamethasone . ``
The reason why an increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase should be needed in order for dexamethasone to inhibit cell growth is not understood at the present time .
Nevertheless , the results of this study suggest that an absence of the S phase increase in dexamethasone binding could represent a new mechanism of dexamethasone resistance in lymphoid cells .
Alternatively , it is possible that the increase in .
dexamethasone binding during S phase is not directly required for mediating growth inhibition by dexamethasone but is secondary to another cell-cycle-related process that is required in order for dexamethasone to inhibit cell growth .
The most simple explanation for changes in dexamethasone binding during the cell cycle is that the number of dexamethasone receptors per cell increases in parallel with the increase in cell size `` `` and cellular protein content , `` which occurs as cells progress through the cell cycle in preparation for mitosis .
Thus , one might expect that the number of dexamethasone receptors per cell should approximately double between G , and G , /M phases of the cell cycle .
The results of the present study indicate that this explanation is unlikely to be correct .
First , the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell increased maximally during S phase and decreased during late S and G , /M phase , even though cell size continued to increase .
Second , the amount of dexamethasone bound per milligram of cell protein increased during S phase and decreased during G , /M phase .
Third , as pointed out before , there was no change in the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell in the case of three dexamethasone-resistant cell lines , even though cell size and protein content increased during the cell cycle .
Therefore , another mechanism must be responsible for the cell-cycle-related change in dexamethasone binding .
One potential mechanism is an increase in the rate of receptor synthesis during S phase , although most cell proteins are synthesized at a constant rate throughout the cell cycle . ``
Inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis have been shown to block the S phase increase in dexamethasone binding by HeLa Cells . ``
Another potential explanation for the increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase is the activation of existing receptors from a non-steroid-binding form , or proreceptor , to a form that binds steroid .
This hypothesis would be consistent with previous studies demonstrating that glucocorticoid receptors in lymphoid cells From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

112 can be rapidly inactivated and reactivated , possibly due to receptor dephosphorylation and phosphoryla-tion.20.29 The mechanism responsible for the absence of an S phase increase in dexamethasone binding in dexamethasone-resistant cell lines is unknown .
In the present study , absence of an S phase increase in dexamethasone binding was observed in receptor-defective variants of the $ 49 mouse lymphoma cell line , which have nuclear transfer increased ( S49 143R ) and nuclear transfer deficient ( S49 22R ) phenotypes .
Therefore , absence of an S phase increase in dexamethasone binding does not appear to be limited to cells that have a particular type of receptor defect .
In addition , studies of the IM-9 cell line indicate that absence of an S phase increase in dexamethasone binding can occur in a cell line that has normally functioning dexamethasone receptors .
Although the proliferation of IM-9 cells is not inhibited by dexamethasone , dexametha- DISTELHORST , BENUTTO , AND BERGAMIN !
sone induces an increase in insulin receptor synthesis in IM-9 cells , and the induction process appears to be mediated by dexamethasone receptors . ``
Therefore , studies with the IM-9 cell line suggest that absence of an S phase increase in dexamethasone binding may not be due to a defect in the dexamethasone receptors themselves , but may be due to loss of a nonreceptor function or factor that regulates dexamethasone binding during the cell cycle .
It is possible that , through a loss of the S phase increase in glucocorticoid binding during development , lymphoid cells could become resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids while maintaining otherwise normal receptor function and sensitivity to other actions of glucocorti-coids .
