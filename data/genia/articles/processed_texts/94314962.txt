a « -Tocopherol Inhibits Agonist-induced Monocytic Cell Adhesion to Cultured Human Endothelial Cells Rishad Faruqi , Carol de la Motte , and Paul E. DiCorieto Department of Cell Biology , Research Institute of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation , Cleveland , Ohio 44195 Abstract Antioxidants have been proposed to be anti-atherosclerotic agents ; however , the mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects are poorly understood .
We have examined the effect of a-tocopherol ( a-tcp ) on one cellular event in atherosclerotic plaque development , monocyte adhesion to stimulated endothelial cells ( ECs ) .
Human umbilical vein ECs were pretreated with a-tcp before stimulation with known agonists of monocyte adhesion : IL-1 ( 10 ng/ml ) , LPS ( 10 ng/ ml ) , thrombin ( 30 U/ml ) , or PMA ( 10 nM ) .
Agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion , but not basal adhesion , was inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by a-tep .
The IC , , of a-tep on an IL-1-induced response was 45 pM .
The inhibition correlated with a decrease in steady state levels of E-selectin mRNA and cell surface expression of E-selectin which is consistent with the ability of a monoclonal antibody to E-selectin to inhibit monocytic cell adhesion in this system .
Probucol ( 50 mM ) and N-acetylcysteine ( 20 mM ) also inhibited agonist-induced monocytic cell adhe-sion ; whereas , several other antioxidants had no significant effect .
Protein kinase C ( PKC ) does not appear to play a role in the a-tep effect since no suppression of phosphorylation of PKC substrates was observed .
Activation of the transcription factor NF-B is reported to be necessary but not sufficient for E-selectin expression in EC .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays failed to show an a-tep-induced decrease in activation of this transcription factor after cytokine stimulation .
It has been hypothesized that a-tep acts as an anti-atherosclerotic molecule by inhibiting generation of oxidized LDL-a putative triggering molecule in the atherosclerotic process .
Our results point to a novel alternative mechanism of action of a-tcp .

els of atherosclerosis ( 1-7 ) .
Altered or dysfunctional endothelium expresses a number of cytokines , adhesion molecules , va-soactive compounds , and growth factors , which in turn attract , activate , and cause the transendothelial migration of monocytes ( 8-12 ) .
Monocyte adhesion to activated endothelial cells ( EC 's ) !
in vitro therefore serves as a useful model to simulate the early cellular events in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis .
The direct mechanism of EC activation in vivo is unknown .
Free radical-mediated injury , either direct or indirect ( by the generation of oxidized lipoproteins in the micro-environment of the endothelium ) , is one proposed mechanism by which EC are rendered pro-atherogenic ( 13-15 ) .
Biological response modifi-ers , such as IL-1 , LPS , thrombin , and PMA , have also been shown to activate endothelium and cause enhanced monocyte adhesion in vitro .
One way in which such diverse substances may act is by the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen intermediates that serve as second messengers in gene activation ( 16-20 ) .
a « -Tocopherol ( a-tep ) or vitamin E , a lipid-soluble vitamin and biological response modifier , is a chain-breaking tissue antioxidant ( 21 ) .
A ubiquitous molecule present at low concentrations in all biomembranes , it has been reported to be an anti-atherogenic agent ( 22 ) .
Though the mechanism of a-tep action has not been rigorously demonstrated , it has been hypothesized that it acts through inhibiting generation of oxidized LDL-a putative triggering molecule in the atherosclerotic process .
a-tep is believed to act as a cytoprotective agent in a number of other pathophysiological processes ( 23 ) .
-tep is also thought to be an immune modulator , enhancing both cell-mediated and humoral immunity ( 24 , 25 ) .
The cytoprotective effect of a-tep is attributed to its ability to act as a scavenger of highly reactive oxygen radicals , thus stabilizing membranes against lipid peroxidation ( 26-29 ) .
The intracellular signaling events involved in mediating monocyte adhesion to activated EC are not fully defined .
Protein kinase C ( PKC ) , a family of isoenzymes , is responsible for a number of intracellular events involved in receptor-mediated signal transduction , receptor down-regulation , cell activation , transformation , and proliferation ( 30 , 31 ) .
We have previously reported that 1- ( S-isoquinolinesulfonyl ) -2-methylpiperazine di-hydrochloride ( H-7 ) , an inhibitor of PKC , abolishes agonist-induced monocyte adhesion , suggesting that PKC activation may be necessary for this process ( 32 ) .
Recently , a-tcp has also been shown to inhibit PKC in rat brain homogenates ( 33 ) , permeabilized vascular smooth muscle cells and neuroblastoma cells ( 34 ) .
Another potential site of action of a-tcp in abrogating agonist-induced monocyte adhesion is at the level of the tran 1 .

E-selectin , an endothelial adhesion molecule first cloned and characterized by Bevilacqua et al .
( 35 , 36 ) , has been reported to be an important player in monocyte adhesion to EC ( 37 , 38 ) .
The promoter region of the E-selectin gene contains a binding site for NF- « B ( 39 ) .
This transcription factor is thought to be necessary in regulating transcription of the E-selectin gene ( 40 ) and appears to be activated by reactive oxygen intermediates and PKC ( 41 , 42 ) , both of which can be potential target sites for the action of a-tcp .
In this study we have investigated the effect of a-tcp on stimulated monocytic cell adhesion to EC and the sites along the signaling pathways of E-selectin expression that may be responsible for mediating the effect of a-top .
Methods Cell culture .
Human umbilical vein ECs were isolated by a technique similar to that described by Lewis et al .
( 43 ) , as we have previously described ( 32 ) .
The collected cells were washed and seeded into fibro-nectin-coated flasks ( 5 ug/ml rabbit fibronectin ) under the conditions described by Thornton et al .
( 44 ) and grown in DME/F12 media ( Irvine Scientific Co. , Irvine , CA ) supplemented with 15 % FBS , heparin ( 90 ug/ml ) , endothelial cell growth factor ( 150 pg/ml ) , sodium bicarbonate ( 0.24 % ) , MEM non-essential amino acids ( 0.1 mM ) , penicillin ( 100 U/ ml ) , and streptomycin ( 100 ug/ml ) .
EC were used between the first and fourth subculture .
U937 cells originally derived from a human histiocytic lymphoma were procured from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) and grown in suspension culture in RPMI-1640 media ( M.A .
Bioproducts , Walkersville , MD ) containing 5 % FBS and routinely subcultured at a 1:5 ratio three times per week .
Separation of human leukocytes .
Monocytes were separated from peripheral blood ( 100 U/ml heparin ) by a modification of the method of Recalde ( 45 ) as we have recently described in detail ( 46 ) .
Briefly , total mononuclear cells were collected by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation ( 47 ) , treated with NaCl , and re-isolated with Ficoll-Hy-paque .
The isolated monocytes were resuspended in MCDB 107 + 5 % FBS in a Teflon beaker to prevent attachment during radioactive label-ing .
Isolated populations were routinely 78-90 % monocytes by differential count with buffered Wright-Giemsa stain , and viability was always > 90 % by Trypan blue dye exclusion .
Assay for monocytic cell adhesion to endothelial cells .
U937 cell monocyte adhesion to ECs was measured as previously described ( 48 ) .
Briefly , ECs were plated into 24-well plates 48 to 72 h before the assay .
In nutritional experiments , the growth medium was supplemented with a-tep ( 45 M ) .
When the ECs were confluent , the media was changed to MCDB 107 + 5 % FBS with or without a-tep for the given pretreatment time .
In some experiments the concentration of FBS in the pretreatment media was varied .
On the day of the assay the media was once again changed and additional a-tcp added prior to stimulation with the various agonists for 4 to 6 h at 37°C .
U937 cells or human monocytes were labeled for 90 min at 37°C with 100 LCi *'Cr as sodium chromate ( NEN , Boston , MA ) in 1 ml culture media .
The labeled cells were washed by centrifugation and 10° viable cells added per well of ECs after removal of the incubation media .
This binding phase of the assay was performed at 4°C for 1 h , then the wells were washed and the cells lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 and an aliquot removed for quantitation of radiolabel .
The number of U937 cells or monocytes bound per well was calculated from the initial specific activity ( ¢pm/cell ) .
Spontaneous release of *'Cr from the monocytic cells during the assay incubation was < 5 % .
All presented data are representative of at least three experiments with determinations made in triplicate .
Protein synthesis by ECs .
Protein synthesis by the ECs was determined by the incorporation of [ *H ] leucine into TCA-precipitable material , as we have previously described ( 49 ) .
Briefly , EC were incubated for 4 h under the same conditions as for the monocytic cell adhesion assay in the presence of [ *H } leucine ( 2 uCi/ml ) .
The cell-associated and secreted protein synthesis was measured by TCA precipitation of the proteins , solubilization of the membranes with 0.25 N sodium hydroxide and determination of the radioactivity incorporated into the TCA-precipitable material .
Measurement of E-selectin on EC surface .
E-selectin expressed on the surface of ECs was quantified using an anti-E-selectin monoclonal antibody ( 7A9 ) ( 50 ) , as we have previously described ( 51 ) .
Briefly , ECs were cultured in 48-well plates for 48 h. At confluence , the media was changed to MCDB 107 + 5 % FBS with or without a-tcp for 72 h. On the day of the assay the media was changed once again and new a-tep added before stimulation with IL-1 for 4 h at 37°C .
Following stimulation , the cells were washed twice with MCDB 107 media containing 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) .
The primary monoclonal antibody 7A9 and secondary biotin-conjugated affinity-purified F ( ab ' ) , ; fragment goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM ( Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories , Inc. , West Grove , PA ) were prepared in wash media ( 1 % BSA ) and added to the wells in a sequential manner for 30 min each , followed by ' `` I-streptavidin ( 5 Ci/ml ) for 15 min .
All incubations were performed at 4°C with the wells being washed 3-4 times between each incubation .
ECs were lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 and an aliquot removed for radiolabel quantitation .
A nonspecific isotype control protein MOPC 21 ( a mouse myeloma IgG1 -- protein ) , was included as a negative control to ascertain the specificity of the monoclonal antibody .
Northern analysis .
Human umbilical vein EC were grown to confluence in 15-cm-diameter plates with MCDB 107 containing 15 % FBS , 90 mg/ml heparin and 150 mg/ml ECGS at 37°C in 5 % CO ; .
Once confluent , the cells were pretreated for 72 h with fresh media ( MCDB + 5 % FBS ) with or without a-tep ( 45 uM ) .
On the day of the experi-ment , the medium was changed again and the monolayers treated with IL-1 ( 10 ng/ml ) or media for 2 h at 37°C .
Steady-state mRNA levels were determined by northern analysis as previously described ( 51 ) .
The conditioned medium was then aspirated ; the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) ; and the total RNA extracted with guanidinium isothiocyanate .
RNA was obtained by isopycnic centrifugation over CsCl ( 52 ) and separated by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde denaturing gel .
RNA was then transferred from the gel to a Nytran ( Schleicher & Schuell , Keene , NH ) membrane by capillary transfer , UV crosslinked , prehybridized at 42°C for a minimum of 6 h and hybridized overnight at 42°C with P-dCTP random primer-labeled cDNA probe for E-selectin ( 1.85 kb cDNA in pCDN [ amp ' ] ) or a °P-dCTP kinase-labeled oligonucleotide probe for the 18 S ribosomal RNA .
The blots were then washed until the background counts were insignificant and subjected to autoradiography at -70°C .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
The synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence for the NFkB DNA binding site in the E-selectin promoter , GGGGATTTCC was synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA Synthesizer and purified by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column .
The sequence of the 28-residue oligonucleotide was taken from the promoter region of the E-selectin gene ( 5-AGGCCATT-GGGGATTTCCTCT-TTACTGG-3 ' ) ( 53 ) .
( The underlined sequence represents the consensus B region . )
In competition studies an unrelated oligonucleotide representing the TF-IIIC consensus sequence ( -5'-CCGGATCCGGGGTTC-GAACCCCGGCCCAA-3 ' ) was used ( 54 ) .
The oligonucleotide probes were annealed and labeled by a `` 'filling-in `` reaction , using a- [ `` °P ] -dCTP , unlabeled dTTP and the Kienow fragment of DNA polymerase I .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modified procedure of Dignam et al .
( 55 ) .
After 72 h of pretreatment with a-tep ( 90 uM ) , EC were treated with IL-1 ( 10 ng/ml ) for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of fresh a-top .
Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS , scraped and harvested by centrifugation .
Cells were resuspended and incubated on ice for 15 min in hypotonic buffer A ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 , 10 mM KCI , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF , 10 ug/ml each of aprotinin , pepstatin A , leupeptin , and antipain ) and then vortexed for 10 s with 0.6 % NP-40 .
Nuclei were separated from the cytosol by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 60 s and were resuspended in buffer C ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 , 25 % glycerol , 0.4 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 Vitamin E Inhibits Induced Monocyte Adhesion to Endothelium 593 \ mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF , 10 ug/ml each of aprotinin , pepstatin A , leupeptin , and antipain ) and shaken for 30 min at 4°C .
Nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 g and dia-lyzed against buffer D ( 20 mM Tris-Cl , pH 7.9 , 0.1 M KCI , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF , 20 % glycerol ) , overnight at 4°C .
Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay ( Bio Rad , Richmond , CA ) .
For binding reactions , nuclear extracts ( 5 ug protein ) were incubated in 15-25 pl of total reaction volume , containing 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 , 60 mM NaCl , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 8 % glycerol and 2.0 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Piscataway , NJ ) and radiolabeled oligonucleotide ( 40,000-50,000 cpm ) , for 15 min at room temperature .
In competition analysis studies , 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide or an unrelated oligonucleotide ( TF HIC ) was coincubated with the nuclear extract for 15 min before the binding reaction with the radiolabeled probe .
Samples were loaded on non-denaturing 6 % polyacrylamide gels in low-ionic-strength buffer ( 22.3 mM Tris , 22.2 mM borate , 0.5 mM EDTA ) and electrophoresis performed at 15 V/cm with cooling .
The gel was then dried and analyzed by autoradiography .
Protein phosphorylation in ECs .
To study the effect of a-tcp on PKC , protein phosphorylation assays were conducted using a modification of the method described by Rozengurt et al .
( 56 ) .
Briefly , EC were grown to confluence in 21-cm* cell culture dishes coated with fibronectin , as described above .
Once confluent , the media was changed to MCDB 107 containing 5 % FBS , with or without a-tep , for 72 h. All experiments were done in duplicate dishes .
On the day of the assay the EC were metabolically labeled using *P-orthophosphate ( 200 uCi/ml ) ( ICN , Irvine , CA ) , in phosphate-free media with or without a-tep ( 45 pM ) for 2 h at 37°C .
Half an hour prior to stimulation , some plates were treated with the PKC inhibitor , H-7 ( 100 M ) ( Seikagaku America , Inc. , St. Petersburg , FL ) .
The cells were then stimulated with PMA ( 10 nM ) , which served as a positive control , or IL-1/3 ( 10 ng/ml ) for 5 min .
The reaction was stopped by removing the incubation media and washing three times with ice cold PBS .
This was followed by two 10-min 10 % TCA washes and three subsequent PBS washes at 4°C .
The TCA-insoluble material was solubilized with 0.25 ml of 1 % NP-40 ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) in 10 mM Tris , 10 mM NaCl , and 2 mM MgCl ; .
The lysate was microcentrifuged ( 14,000 rpm for 15 min ) at 4°C .
The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic extract was transferred to another microcentrifuge tube , 50 l of 5 % Laemmli buffer added and the mixture boiled for 3 min before separation by SDS-PAGE , using a 10 % gel as described by Laemmli ( 57 ) .
The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at -70°C .

Results a-tcp inhibits IL-1-induced monocyte adhesion to ECs .
a « -tep inhibited IL-1 -induced U937 cell adhesion to ECs in a time- ( Fig .

The ICs , for a-tep was 45 uM , a physiologically relevant concentration since plasma levels of this vitamin are normally in the range of 20-35 uM ( 58 ) .
The optimal pretreatment time for the inhibitory effect was ~ 72 h. Unstimulated monocytic cell adhesion to ECs was negligible and unaffected by a-tcp pretreatment of 594 Faruqi et al .

the ECs .
The decrease in IL-1-induced monocytic cell binding to ECs varied in different EC isolates and ranged from 30-70 % inhibition in the presence of 45 wM a-tep .
Protein synthesis by the ECs , as measured by [ *H ] leucine incorporation into TCA-precipitable material , was not significantly affected by the tcp pretreatment , except for a slight reduction at the highest concentrations used ( Fig .

Inhibition of IL-1 -induced leukocyte adhesion to ECs was confirmed using freshly isolated blood monocytes ( Fig .
3 ) .
In multiple experiments with normal monocytes a-tcp-induced inhibition of adhesion was comparable to that seen with U937 cells .
To determine whether the inhibitory effect of a-tep was specific for IL-1-induced adhesion , we tested a series of agonists for the sensitivity of their stimulation to a-tep .
ECs were treated with LPS ( 10 ng/ml ) , PMA ( 10 nM ) , and a-thrombin ( 30 U/ml ) , for 4 to 6 h after 72 h pretreatment with a-tep ( 45 M ) .
In every case a-tcp significantly abrogated the agonist-induced response ( Fig .

This was true even if no a-tcp was added during the pretreatment phase of the experiment .
The most marked decrease in monocytic cell binding was observed with ECs that were treated with a-tcp both in the `` growth `` and `` pretreatment `` phase of the experiment ( Fig .

Neither the basal level of binding nor protein synthesis was affected by a-tcp in either phase ( data not shown ) .
Effect of a « -tcp on EC expression of E-selectin .
It has been reported that E-selectin is involved in the adhesion of monocytes to cultured ECs ( 37 , 38 ) .
We have verified this in our system by demonstrating the ability of an anti-E-selectin monoclonal antibody to dramatically inhibit U937 cell adhesion to IL-l-treated EC in the presence or absence of a-tcp ( Fig .

To determine the effect of a-top on E-selectin expression , we quantified this glycoprotein on the EC surface using a mono IL-1 Alpha-tocopherol + IL-1 [ U Figure 6 .

Effect of a « -tep on U937 cell adhesion and surface expression of E-selectin by ECs .
ECs were pretreated with a-tep ( 45 LM ) for 72 h before stimulation with IL-1 ( 10 ng/ml ) for 4 h for the adhesion assay and as shown for E-selectin expression .
( A ) The adhesion assay was performed as described in the legend to Fig .

clonal antibody 7A9 in a sandwich-type radioimmunoassay .
Under basal conditions or following a-tep pretreatment alone , EC did not express detectable levels of E-selectin .
IL-1 stimulation of the ECs caused a marked induction of E-selectin expression which was significantly blunted with a-tcp pretreatment ( P < 0.01 ) ( Fig .
7 ) .
This decrease in E-selectin expression correlated well with the inhibition of agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion by a-tcp ( Fig .
7 ) .
An unrelated immunoglobulin , MOPC 21 , failed to show a corresponding increase in surface binding , indicating the specificity of 7A9 ( data not shown ) .
To address the issue of specificity with respect to E-selectin we have assessed the effect of a-tep on induced surface expression of ICAM-1 .
ICAM-1 was found to be constitutively high and only slightly induced at the time point under study which is consistent with the published results of others .
a-tep had no significant effect on this induction ( data not shown ) .

Northern analysis was performed to determine if the cytokine-induced steady state mRNA levels of E-selectin were affected by a-tcp pretreatment .
E-selectin mRNA was not detected under basal conditions in the presence or absence of a-top .
IL-1 stimulation of ECs for 2 h resulted in a marked induction of E-selectin mRNA and this induction was significantly abrogated by pretreating the ECs with a-tep for 72 h before stimulation ( Fig .
8 ) .
mRNA levels were normalized to the amount of 188 ribosomal RNA to ensure equal loading of the lanes .
The autoradiograph was subjected to densitometric evaluation which revealed a 35 % reduction in E-selectin mRNA in response to a-tcp .
This decrease correlated well with the decreased expression of the glycoprotein and decreased agonist-induced monocyte adhesion to ECs .
Effect of antioxidants on agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion to ECs .
To determine whether a-top was acting by its free radical scavenging ability , we tested other known antioxidants for their ability to inhibit agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion .
The results were variable ; while some of the antioxidants did reduce induced-adhesion , others did not ( Table D ) .
Ascorbic acid , a water-soluble antioxidant , in fact appeared to further stimulate induced adhesion .
None of the antioxidants tested had any significant effect on basal levels of adhesion .
Among the other antioxidants tested only Probucol and N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) significantly reduced IL-1-induced adhesion .
Probucol ( 50 uM ) , a lipid-soluble antioxidant , decreased agonist-induced adhesion by 45 % ; at higher concentrations Probucol was toxic to ECs .
NAC ( 20 mM ) , a water-soluble antioxidant , reduced IL-1-induced monocytic cell adhesion by 36 % without altering protein synthesis .
Other antioxidants tested , such as DPPD , Tiron , and Desferal , failed to abrogate agonist-induced adhesion at nontoxic concentrations .
When ascorbic acid and a-tep were used together , no net effect was observed .
In acting as a free radical scavenger , a-tep is itself oxidized .
Since we pretreated ECs for 72 h , it was likely that oxidation products of a-tep accumulated in the microenvironment of the ECs during this time .
We explored the possibility that the oxidation products of a-tep may be responsible for the inhibitory effect on stimulated adhesion .
Copper sulfate , a known pro-oxidant , has been shown to accelerate the oxidation of low density lipoproteins ( 59 ) .
Incubation of copper sulfate with a-tep would presumably then accelerate oxidation of the vitamin over the 72 h pretreatment period .
While copper sulfate alone had no effect on agonist-induced adhesion , when used in combination with a-tcp , it diminished the inhibitory effect of the Table I .

latter , although the levels of adhesion remained lower than the IL-1-stimulated control levels ( Table I ) .
Effect of a-tcp on NF- « B activation .
Certain antioxidants have been shown to prevent the activation of the transcription factor NF- « B in lymphoid cells ( 20 , 41 ) .
The 5 ' flanking region of the E-selectin gene contains an NF- « B binding site and this transcription factor has been reported to be important in the regulation of E-selectin gene transcription ( 39 , 53 ) .
Reactive oxygen intermediates and PKC have both been reported to activate NF- « B in other cell types ( 42 ) .
Hence , a-tep could potentially affect the activity of this transcription factor , either directly by its free radical scavenging property or indirectly by inhibiting PKC .
We used EMSAs to determine whether a-tcp was inhibiting agonist-induced monocytic cell adhesion in EC by blocking NF- « B activation .
ECs stimulated with IL-1 ( 10 ng/ml ) for 1 h contained nuclear proteins corresponding to NF- « B ( Fig .
9 ) .
Pretreatment of the ECs with a-top for 72 h before stimulation with IL-1 failed to demonstrate a decrease in nuclear protein binding to the labeled NF-kB oligonucleotide probe ( Fig .
9 ) .
Gel shift bands corresponding to NF-kB were not observed in nuclear extracts from unstimulated ECs nor did a-tep pretreatment of the EC 's induce the appearance of this band .
Specificity of the NF- « B binding was verified by competition analysis studies .
Coincubating the ECs nuclear extracts with a hundred fold molar excess of unlabeled NF- « B probe , before the binding reaction , caused the disappearance of the gel shift band observed in nuclear extracts from IL-1-stimulated ECs .

Similar coincubation with an unrelated oligonucleotide , TF IIIC , caused no change in the NF- « B band ( Fig .
9 ) .
This result suggested that a-tcp decreased E-selectin gene expression by an NF- « B-independent mechanism .
Effect of on PKC .
a « -tcp has been reported to inhibit the activity of PKC in vascular smooth muscle cells and neuroblastoma cells ( 34 ) .
Since PKC is thought to play a role in mediating agonist-induced monocyte adhesion ( 32 ) , we tested whether a-tcp exerted its effect by suppressing PKC activity in ECs .
We tested the effect of a-tecp pretreatment of ECs on PKC activity , by quantifying the phosphorylation of the 80-kD , myristoylated , alanine-rich C kinase substrate ( MARCKS ) protein , that has been shown to be specifically phosphorylated by PKC ( 56 , 60 ) and a good indicator of PKC activity ( 61-64 ) .
PMA , a well-established activator of PKC , served as a positive control for the phosphorylation of MARCKS .
H-7 pretreatment of EC before PMA stimulation , served as a negative control , thought the inhibition of MARCKS phosphorylation was not dramatic in this specific experiment .
Under basal conditions a-tcp did not affect the phosphorylation of MARCKS .
PMA caused a significant increase in the phosphorylation of this protein .
However , when the ECs were stimulated with IL-1 , MARCKS phosphorylation was not significantly increased ; nor was any decrease in protein phosphorylation observed after pretreatment of the ECs with a-tcp ( Fig .
10 ) .
This suggested that IL-1 induction of E-selectin was occurring independent of PKC .
a-Tep was unable to inhibit the phosphorylation of the MARCKS in ECs induced by thrombin and PMA ( data not shown ) , both of which are known to activate PKC .
This suggested that in our intact cell system , a-top appeared to mediate its inhibitory effect on agonist-induced adhesion independent Vitamin E Inhibits Induced Monocyte Adhesion to Endothelium 597 MARCKS | kD < -- 69 kD < -- 46 kD $ a - » - Cnentmam| < - : .

of PKC .
Additionally , a 29-kD protein ( p29 ) , initially reported by Levin and Santell to undergo PKC-independent phosphorylation in ECs in responses to IL-1 ( 65 , 66 ) , was also noted to be phosphorylated in our studies .
This protein has been recently found to be identical to heat shock protein 27 ( HSP27 ) , the phosphorylation of which appears to be PKC dependent ( 67 ) .
a « -Tep pretreatment of EC did not inhibit the phosphorylation of p29 in our experiment ( Fig .
10 ) .
Discussion a-top , a lipid-soluble vitamin , has been shown to protect the plasma membrane from oxidant stress by virtue of its ability to function as a naturally occurring , chain breaking antioxidant ( 21 , 26 ) .
a-tep has also been reported to be an anti-atherogenic agent ( 22 ) .
Recently published epidemiological studies suggest a beneficial role for « -tep supplementation in the prevention of coronary events ( 68 , 69 ) , lending further support to experimental observations .
While it is largely believed that a-tcp serves a protective function by preventing the oxidation of LDL , a molecule believed to play a central role in the development of the atherosclerotic plaque , the exact mechanisms involved are incompletely understood .
In this study we demonstrate that & -tcp may also have effects at the level of vascular cell gene expression .
Our results suggest an additional and novel mechanism by which a-tep may prevent the progress of atherosclero-sis , that is by inhibiting induced monocyte adhesion to the endo-thelium .
We have demonstrated in this study that a-tep inhibits agonist-induced monocyte adhesion to EC with an ICs , of 45 LM , consistent with normal plasma levels .
a-tep was not cytotoxic , except at concentrations significantly higher than physiological levels .
Furthermore , inhibition of the agonist-induced response occurred with multiple stimulators , suggesting that the site of action of a-tep was downstream from the agonist receptor .
We also observed that when ECs were cultured in media containing a-tcp as a nutritional supplement they were less adhesive to 598 Faruqi et al .
monocytic cells after IL-1 treatment .
This was true even if the ECs were not exposed to a-tep during the `` pretreatment `` phase of the experiment .
Since has a half-life of 56-74 h in intact EC membranes ( 70 ) , its presence in both phases of the experiment would conceivably have a cumulative effect , leading to an increase in effective concentration of a-tep in the membranes of ECs .
This could account for the observation that ECs exposed to a-tep during both phases bound the least number of monocytic cells .
A case could therefore be made for a-tep supplementation during procedures involving EC denudation , since in vitro experiments suggest that wounded ECs are especially adhesive to monocytes ( 48 ) .
To determine whether the inhibitory effect of a-tep was a function of its antioxidant property , we tested other known lipid-soluble and water-soluble antioxidants to determine if they had similar inhibitory effects on agonist-induced monocyte adhesion .
The results varied depending on the antioxidant tested .
Ascorbate was found to be stimulatory , rather than inhibitory , which could be explained by the observation that under certain conditions ascorbate functions as a pro-oxidant , rather than an antioxidant , possibly due to the ability of ascorbic acid to release transitional metal ions from protein complexes leading to the generation of free radicals ( 71-77 ) .
Ascorbic acid has been shown to protect a-tep from oxidation and in doing so enhance the latter 's antioxidant activity ( 78-80 ) .
In our studies the addition of ascorbate plus a-tcp led to no net effect on agonist-induced monocyte adhesion , which suggests the possibility that the a-tep reduced the enhancement in IL-1 -induced adhesion caused by ascorbate alone .
The inhibitory effect of Probucol and NAC , two structurally unrelated antioxidants , could make a case for a-tep functioning as an antioxidant in exerting its inhibitory effect .
This must , however , be interpreted with caution since several other antioxidants had no inhibitory effect on induced adhesion .
Oxidation products of a-tep are probably not responsible for decreased monocytic cell adhesion since pretreatment of ECs with copper sulfate and a-tep together did not enhance the inhibitory effect of the latter .
The degree of variability in the effects of the different antioxidants on agonist-induced monocyte adhesion to ECs may reflect the diverse free radical scavenging systems present within ECs .
To delineate the mechanisms through which a-tcp may be acting , we have studied two possible targets along the signal transduction pathway of inducible adhesion molecules , i.e .
, PKC and the nuclear transcription factor NF- « B .
The role of PKC as a mediator of cytokine-induced expression of adhesion molecules by , and leukocyte adhesion to ECs remains contro-versial , with some studies indicating a role for the enzyme , and other reports contesting this ( 32 , 53 , 81-85 ) .
PMA and thrombin stimulation of ECs did cause an increase in phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein and a-tep did not inhibit this event ( data not shown ) , suggesting a PKC-independent mode of action of the vitamin .
Further evidence supporting this conclusion is the inability of a-tep to prevent the IL-1 -induced phosphorylation of a 29-kD protein in EC ( Fig .
10 ) , the phosphorylation of which has been reported to be PKC dependent ( 67 ) .
A number of different cytokines and biological response modifiers have been shown to exert their cellular effects through the activation of nuclear transcription factors , a notable example of which is the trimolecular complex , NF- « B ( 42 ) .
Sequence analysis of the 5 ' flanking region of the E-selectin gene in ECs , has revealed an NF- « B binding site ( 39 ) .
The oxidation of NF- « B by free radicals has been hypothesized as one mechanism by which this transcription factor is activated ( 20 , 41 , 86 ) .
Furthermore , IL-1 , TNF-a , LPS , and PMA have all been reported to increase intracellular levels of free radicals ( 86 ) .
Although a *'cause-effect `` relationship has not been directly demonstrated , certain thiol-containing antioxidants have been reported to prevent the activation of NF- « B in some lymphoid cell lines ( 20 , 41 ) , suggesting a role for free radicals in gene activation .
It is conceivable then , that a-tep was acting similarly in our EC system , inhibiting E-selectin gene transcription by preventing the activation of NF- « B by free radicals generated within the cells .
While we have confirmed the activation of NF- « B by IL-1 in EC , a-tep did not affect the activation of this transcription factor at vitamin concentrations that caused marked decreases in E-selectin mRNA and protein expression .
Our oligomer probe for these studies was derived from the sequence of the E-selectin promoter and therefore the nuclear factor we quantitated was of direct relevance to our other observations .
It must be kept in mind , however , that a family of NF- « B proteins are known to exist and that some of these might be much more sensitive to the presence of antioxidants .
A report appeared during revision of this manuscript that supports the contention that antioxidants , in their case PDTC , do not suppress activation of NF- « B using the E-selectin consensus sequence in a gel shift assay ( 87 ) .
The mechanism by which a-tep exerts its effects remain to be elucidated .
However , our study points to a novel target site for the protective action of a-tep in which this vitamin acts at the cellular level to decrease E-selectin gene expression in ECs with a consequent decrease in leukocyte adhesion .
In so doing , a-top may prove beneficial in multiple pathological situations involving the adhesion of leukocytes , including inflammation , and atherosclerosis .
