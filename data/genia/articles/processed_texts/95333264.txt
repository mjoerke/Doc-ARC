8 The Peri-kB Site Mediates Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 Enhancer Activation in Monocytes but Not in T Cells NINA M. CLARK , : MARK C. anp DAVID M. MARKOVITZ'* Department of Internal Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute , `` University of Michigan Medical Center , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109-0642 Received 23 December 1994/Accepted 8 May 1995 Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV-2 ) , like HIV-1 , causes AIDS and is associated with AIDS cases primarily in West Africa .
HIV-1 and HIV-2 display significant differences in nucleic acid sequence and in the natural history of clinical disease .
Consistent with these differences , we have previously demonstrated that the enhancer/promoter region of HIV-2 functions quite differently from that of HIV-1 .
Whereas activation of the HIV-1 enhancer following T-cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the transcription factor NF-KB to two adjacent B sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat , activation of the HIV-2 enhancer in monocytes and T cells is dependent on four cis-acting elements : a single xB site , two purine-rich binding sites , PuB1 and PuB2 , and a pets site .
We have now identified a novel cis-acting element within the HIV-2 enhancer , immediately upstream of the « B site , designated peri- < B .
This site is conserved among isolates of HIV-2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus , and transfection assays show this site to mediate HIV-2 enhancer activation following stimulation of monocytic but not T-cell lines .
This is the first description of an HIV-2 enhancer element which displays such monocyte specificity , and no comparable enhancer element has been clearly defined for HIV-1 .
While a nuclear factor ( s ) from both peripheral blood monocytes and T cells binds the peri-B site , electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that either a different protein binds to this site in monocytes versus T cells or that the protein recognizing this enhancer element undergoes differential modification in monocytes and T cells , thus supporting the transfection data .
Further , while specific constitutive binding to the peri- « B site is seen in monocytes , stimulation with phorbol esters induces additional , specific binding .
Understanding the monocyte-specific function of the peri- « B factor may ultimately provide insight into the different roles monocytes and T cells play in HIV pathogenesis .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV-2 ) , like HIV-1 , causes AIDS ( 1 , 9 , 11 , 63 ) .
While HIV-2 infection has been associated with AIDS cases in West Africa ( 1 , 9-11 , 13 , 63 ) , it is also becoming increasingly recognized in other areas of the world ( 1 , 11-13 , 48 , 63 ) .
The genomes of HIV-1 and HIV-2 encode similar viral proteins , but HIV-2 shares only approximately 42 % nucleic acid sequence similarity with HIV-1 ( 9 , 10 ) and is instead more closely related to simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) , with which HIV-2 shares 75 % or more sequence similarity , depending on the strain ( 6 , 23 ) .
HIV-1 and HIV-2 not only display significant nucleic acid sequence differences but also show striking biological and clinical differences .
HIV-2 infection progresses to AIDS much more slowly than HIV-1 infection does and demonstrates less efficient perinatal and heterosexual transmission ( 2 , 3 , 13 , 37-39 , 48 , 52 ) .
Furthermore , in tissue culture experiments , mono-clonal antibodies to the T-cell receptor component CD3 stimulate production of HIV-2 but not HIV-1 from latently infected T-cell lines , and HIV-2 is less responsive to stimulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha than HIV-1 ( 33 , 49 ) .
The clinical differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection remain largely unexplained , and it is unknown , for example , why HIV-2 infection displays a much more prolonged period of clinical latency than HIV-1 infection does .
A correlation between clinical latency and latency of HIV on a cellular level has been suspected .
Following infection of cells in vitro , HIV expression is suppressed for a variable period of time until * Corresponding author .

4854 cellular conditions are altered such that they permit replication of the virus ( 20 , 44 , 49 , 56 ) .
In asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals , the number of infected cells in the peripheral blood is low and it is often difficult to demonstrate viral expression in these infected cells ( 18 ) .
Disease progression is associated with marked increases in viral expression in peripheral blood cells ( 36 ) .
Recently it has been noted that there may be a preferential localization of HIV-infected cells actively producing virus in the lymphoid tissue early in HIV-1 infection , despite very low levels of virus production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( 16 , 59 ) .
However , even in the lymph nodes , cellular latency is an important phenomenon , as it has been demonstrated that only a small percentage of infected lymphoid cells are actively making virus at any given time ( 16 ) .
Stimulation of T cells with cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha or antibodies to the T-cell receptor increases transcription of HIV via cellular intermediaries ( 21 , 33 , 41 , 49 , 56 ) .
Similarly , exposure of HIV-infected macrophages and monocytes to activated , uninfected T cells or to cytokines can induce HIV replication ( 21 , 25 , 26 , 61 , 65 ) .
Furthermore , recent data suggest that the level of HIV mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in asymptomatic HIV-infected persons correlates with clinical disease progression over the subsequent 2 to 5 years ( 64 ) .
Since progression of clinical disease is associated with and likely accelerated by an increase in viral replication , we have been interested in the cellular events involved in effecting the transition from HIV latency to replication in monocytes and T cells .
It is possible that differences in transcriptional activation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 may be responsible for the observed differences in the clinical latency period following infection with these viruses .
In studying the transcriptional regulation of HIV-2 , we and Vou .

Stimulation of the HIV-1 enhance-er/promoter in activated T cells is mediated predominantly by binding of the cellular protein NF- « B to two adjacent kB sites in the HIV-1 enhancer ( 50 , 56 ) .
The HIV-2 enhancer , unlike the HIV-1 enhancer , contains only a single functional kB element and also contains at least three other inducible cis-acting elements which we have previously described : two purine-rich an Ets family member which is related to the Drosophila development protein E74 ( 35 , 43 ) .
The PuB and pets sites of HIV-2 are not found in HIV-1 but are conserved among HIV-2 isolates and are also found in another human pathogenic ret-rovirus , human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( 8 ) .
These sites are important for activation of the HIV-2 enhancer in T cells stimulated with phorbol esters , phytohemagglutinin , antibody to the CD3 component of the T-cell receptor complex , and antigen ( 33 , 34 , 49 , 51 ) .
Differences in transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 have also been noted in monocytic cells , which play an important role in HIV infection .
It is believed that monocytes act as a reservoir for HIV in vivo and are involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-related encephalopathy ( 24 , 25 , 35 , 58 , 4856 CLARK ET AL .
71 ) .
Griffin et al .
have shown that activation of the HIV-1 enhancer in immature monocytic cell lines by phorbol myr-istate acetate ( PMA ) is dependent on the induction of NF-kB and its binding to the B sites in the HIV-1 enhancer ( 30 ) .
In mature monocytes , NF- « B is constitutively expressed , leading to a high level of basal expression of HIV-1 and lack of induction by PMA .
We have shown that HIV-2 expression in monocytes following PMA stimulation requires intact PuB and pets enhancer sites in addition to the kB site ( 35 ) .
The different clinical and biological characteristics of infection with HIV-1 compared with HIV-2 may thus in part be a result of the different patterns of transcriptional control of the two viruses .
In the course of performing DNase protection analysis of the HIV-2 LTR , a footprint was noted immediately upstream of the xB site ( Fig .
1A ) .
Analysis of this DNA sequence revealed that the motif , designated the peri-kB site , is conserved across isolates of HIV-2 and SIV ( Fig .
1B ) ( 55 ) and appears to be unique .
Given these findings and the proximity of the site to kB , we were interested in the ability of the peri- « kB site to confer , along with the other cis-acting elements , inducible activation of the HIV-2 enhancer in T cells and/or monocytes .
In the experiments described below , we show that the peri-xB site is involved in regulation of HIV-2 enhancer function in monocytes but unlike the PuB1 , PuB2 , pets , and kB sites , not in T cells .
Mutation of this site leads to markedly diminished transcriptional activation following stimulation in monocytic cells but not in T cells .
Furthermore , the peri- « kB site is specifically recognized by either a different cellular protein in monocytes than in T cells or by a single protein which is differentially modified in the two cell types .
A monocyte-specific transcriptional activator has not previously been described for HIV-2 or clearly delineated for HIV-1 , and such a finding suggests one possible cellular regulatory mechanism which might contribute to the different roles monocytes and T cells play in HIV pathogenesis .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids .
Construction of HIV-2/CAT and HIV-2 A « B/CAT has been described elsewhere ( 17 , 49 ) .
HIV-2 Aperi- « B ( A ) /CAT , HIV-2 Aperi- « B ( B ) /CAT , HIV-2 peri- « B DEL ( -111 , -127/CAT , and HIV-2 Aperi- « B ( A ) +A « B/CAT ( Fig .
1A ) were constructed by using the gap-heteroduplex site-specific mutagenesis protocol as previously described ( 56 ) .
The HIV-2 mutants were sequenced by the dideoxy method ( kit from U.S. Biochemical ) .
Cell transfections and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays .
The Jurkat T leukemia cell line , CEM T leukemia cell line , and the U937 monocytic cell line were maintained in RPMI with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) prior to transfection and RPMI with 5 % FBS after transfection .
The HL-60 cell line was maintained in RPMI with 20 % FBS before and after transfection .
The THP-1 monocytic cell line was maintained in RPMI with 10 % FBS and 50 M B-mercaptocthanol before and after transfection .
Cells were grown under standard conditions .
Cells ( 10 ) were transfected with 5 ug of the indicated plasmid by the DEAE-dextran method ( 62 ) .
Twenty hours after transfection , certain cell groups were incubated for an additional 20 h with 16 nM PMA .
Cell extracts were prepared , and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was determined by standard methods ( 29 ) .
Transfection efficiencies were normalized by protein concentration .
DNase protection assays .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the method of Dignam et al .
( 14 ) .
The Jurkat extract was additionally purified through a KCI step gradient , with the fraction eluting at 0.4 M being used .
For the assays using HeLa cell extracts , a radiolabeled antisense strand probe extending from -51 to -231 was used .
For the experiments using U937 nuclear extracts , both radiolabeled sense and antisense strand probes extending from -96 to -147 were employed , and the probes contained mutations in both the PuB2 and « B sites ( the sequences of these mutations are shown in Fig .
1A ) .
For the experiments using Jurkat nuclear extracts , a radiolabeled sense strand probe extending from -110 to -190 was employed .
The probes were generated and DNase protection assays were performed as previously described ( 15 , 22 , 49 , 51 ) .
EMSAs .
Jurkat , U937 , and HL-60 nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described ( 14 ) from cells which were either unstimulated or treated for 5 to 8 h with 16 nM PMA .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated as follows : buffy coats prepared by the American Red Cross from samples of whole blood from healthy donors were diluted 1:2 with phosphate-buiffered saline and J. ViroL .
layered onto Histopaque-1077 ( Sigma ) .
The cells were centrifuged at 400 x g for 30 min at 25°C , and the mononuclear cell layer was aspirated and washed three times with RPMI containing 5 % FBS .
The cells were then layered on a continuous Percoll ( Pharmacia ) gradient and centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 20 min for separation of monocytic cells from lymphocytes ( 28 ) .
The monocytes and lymphocytes were aspirated separately , and each was washed three times with RPMI containing 5 % FBS .
Unstimulated nuclear extracts were prepared from half of the monocytes ( 14 ) , and the rest were incubated with 16 nM PMA in RPMI with 5 % FBS at 37°C for 6 to 8 h. Nuclear extracts were subsequently prepared from these cells as well .
The lymphocytes were layered onto a discontinuous Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 1,750 x g for 10 min to separate B and T lymphocytes ( 31 ) .
The T cells were aspirated and washed three times with RPMI containing 5 % FBS and nuclear extracts were prepared ( 14 ) .
The sense and antisense strands for the oligonucleotide probe used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 300B synthesizer .
The sequence corresponded to positions -111 to -137 of the HIV-2 enhancer ( Fig .
1A ) .
The single-stranded oligonucleotides were purified on a 15 % polyacrylamide gel , and each strand was labeled with polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [ y-PJATP .
Equimolar amounts of each strand were annealed by incubation at 80°C followed by slow cooling in 500 mM NaCl The double-stranded probe was then purified with a Sephadex G-50 column .
The peri- « B ( C ) oligonucleotide used as a competitor consisted of the sequence corresponding to positions -111 to -135 , the xB competitor oligonucleotide consisted of the sequence corresponding to positions -93 to -114 , the AB competitor oligonucleotide corresponded to positions -93 to -114 with positions -105 to -108 mutated ( Fig .
1A ) , the PuB1 competitor sequence corresponded to positions -151 to -182 , and the pets competitor sequence corresponded to positions -131 to -162 with the PuB2 site mutated at positions -137 to -142 ( Fig .
1A ) .
These oligonucleotides were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 300B synthesizer and were annealed in an identical manner to the peri- « B probe described above .
The binding reaction for the EMSAs ( 8 , 30 , 49 , 66 ) contained 10 ug of nuclear extract , 500 ng of poly ( dI-dC ) , and 15,000 epm of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe in 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , 0.1 M NaCl , and 4 % glycerol in a final reaction volume of 20 wl .
Following incubation at room temperature for 15 min , DNA-protein complexes were run on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel at room temperature in TGE buffer ( 0.05 M Tris , 0.5 M glycine , 0.5 mM EDTA ) at 100 V for 2.5 h. RESULTS The peri-B site is recognized by a nuclear factor in T cells and monocytes .
As noted above , the sequence immediately upstream of the xB site in the HIV-2 enhancer , the peri- « B site , is conserved among isolates of HIV-2 and SIV ( Fig .
1B ) .
DNase footprint analysis was performed , initially with unstimulated HeLa cells , and revealed two footprints : one which included the xB site as well as 5 bp upstream and 4 bp down-stream ; and a second footprint farther upstream of the xB site , located between positions -123 and -126 ( Fig .
2A ) .
DNase footprint analysis was also performed with PMA-stimulated U937 nuclear extracts and both sense-labeled ( Fig .
2B ) and antisense-labeled ( Fig .
2C ) probes .
As with the HeLa cell nuclear extracts , experiments employing U937 nuclear extracts showed a footprint upstream of the peri- « kB site ; with the sense-labeled probe , a footprint between positions -117 and -124 was seen , and with the antisense-labeled probe , a protected region was noted between positions -119 and -126 .
DNase protection assays were also performed with unstimulated Jurkat T-cell nuclear extracts , and these experiments revealed a larger protected sequence which encompassed a region between positions -127 , 17 bp upstream of the xB site , and -110 , which is the endpoint of the probe and the start of the kB site ( data not shown ) .
This large footprint was used to define the boundaries of the peri- « kB site .
From these data , then , we conclude that the peri- « B site is not only a conserved sequence , but it is bound by one or more nuclear factors found in monocytic cells , unstimulated T cells , and HeLa cells .
Mutation of the peri-B site disrupts HIV-2 enhancer function in monocytes but not in T cells .
To determine the ability of the peri-kB site to mediate HIV-2 enhancer activation , we introduced site-specific mutations into the peri- « B site and the xB site of an HIV-2/CAT construct ( Fig .
1A ) .
The sites were mutated either singly or in combination .

DNase protection assays demonstrate a footprint immediately upstream of the « B site in the HIV-2 enhancer .
DNase protection was performed as described previously ( 15 , 22 , 49 ) .
The DNase protection assays were performed with 150 pg of unstimulated HeLa cell nuclear extract and an antisense strand probe ( A ) , 25 ug of U937 nuclear extract and a sense strand probe ( B ) , and 1 or 25 ug of U937 nuclear extract and an antisense strand probe ( C ) .
The sequences of the peri- « B and « B elements are shown below the gels , with dots indicating the bases which constitute the xB site and brackets indicating the protected bases .
The probe used for Fig .
2B and C contained mutated « B and PuB2 sites .
G , G ladder ; F , free probe ; B , bound probe .
nated Aperi-kB ( A ) contains a site-directed mutation at the 5 ' end of the peri- « kB site , and the plasmid designated Aperi-contains a mutation near the 3 ' end of the site .
The peri- « kB DEL , _ ; ; , , -12 , , contains a site-directed deletion of the 17 bp constituting the peri- « B site .
The plasmid Aperi-contains both the peri-kB ( A ) and the kB mutations shown in Fig .
1A .
These plasmids were transfected into the Jurkat and CEM T-cell lines and several monocytic cell lines , including the HL-60 immature cell line , the U937 promonocytic cell line , and the THP-1 mature monocytic cell line .
The data derived from these experiments are shown in Fig .
3 .
In Jurkat cell transfections , mutation of the kB site produced a marked reduction in the response of the HIV-2 enhancer to PMA .
However , neither deletion of the peri- « B site nor mutations within the site had any effect on the responsiveness of the enhancer , as stimulation with PMA consistently led to a > 20-fold activation of the mutant enhancer constructs , similar to levels seen with the wild-type enhancer ( Fig .
3A ) .
Furthermore , mutation of the peri- « B site in combination with the « kB site produced no significant effect beyond that seen following mutation of « kB alone .
Similar results were seen in transfection experiments using CEM cells , another human leu-kemic T-cell line .
As with Jurkat cells , mutation of the xB site of the HIV-2/CAT construct in CEM cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in the enhancer response to PMA , whereas mutation or deletion of the peri- « B site did not significantly affect inducible enhancer function ( data not shown ) .
In HL-60 cells , the wild-type HIV-2/CAT construct was markedly activated ( 43-fold ) by the addition of PMA ( Fig .
3B ) .
However , in contrast to the results seen in the Jurkat and CEM transfections , experiments employing either the Aperi-kB ( A ) or Aperi-kB ( B ) mutant construct demonstrated significantly reduced inducible enhancer function in the HL-60 cells , an effect which was further enhanced by mutation of kB in combination with the peri-kB ( A ) mutation ( threefold activation of the Aperi-kB ( A ) mutant compared with less than onefold activation using the double mutant ) .
Deletion of the peri-xB site also resulted in significantly reduced enhancer function .
Results similar to these were seen in transfection experiments using the mature monocytic cell line THP-1 , with mutations in the peri- « B site leading to a marked reduction in the level of PMA-induced enhancer function ( data not shown ) .
In the U937 monocytic cell line , transfections using mutant Aperi-B ( A ) or Aperi- « kB ( B ) alone had no effect on enhancer function ( Fig .
3C ) , but when the plasmid containing both Aperi-kB ( A ) and a mutated kB site was employed , activation declined from 56-fold with the wild-type enhancer to only 2.5-fold .
This decline represents a pronounced reduction in the ability of PMA to activate the HIV-2 enhancer beyond that seen with the kB site mutated alone : the HIV-2 enhancer was activated 11.5-fold by PMA ( 4.8 % acetylation ) in experiments using the single xB site mutant compared with an activation of only 2.5-fold ( 2.4 % acetylation ) with both xB and peri- « B sites mutated .
These studies indicate that the peri-kB site is important for the function of the HIV-2 enhancer in monocytes but not in T cells .
The peri- « B site binds a specific nuclear factor ( s ) which is different in monocytes and T cells .
In order to further characterize protein binding to the peri- « kB site , EMSAs were performed with a radiolabeled peri-kB site probe and nuclear extracts from U937 and HL-60 cells , unstimulated or incubated with PMA ( Fig .
4 ) .
Binding characteristics were then compared with those found in EMSAs which employed Jurkat T-cell extracts .
A specific complex was observed in extracts from both unstimulated and PMA-induced U937 cells ( Fig .

This complex was significantly diminished by competition with an excess of unlabeled peri- « kB oligonucleotide ( lane 3 ) and to a lesser degree by the slightly shorter peri- « kB ( C ) oligonucleotide ( lane 4 ) but not by the kB site , a mutant xB site , or the PuB1 site of the HIV-2 enhancer ( lanes 5 to 7 ) .
With HL-60 nuclear extracts , there was again a specific complex seen which was almost completely eliminated by competition with an unlabeled peri- « B site oligonucleotide ( Fig .

This complex was not significantly diminished by unrelated competitor oligonucleotides ( lanes 5 to 7 ) .
Experiments employing Jurkat nuclear extracts showed a specific nuclear factor-peri- « B complex as well ( Fig .
4C ) .
In addition , in many ( although not all ) of the EMSA experiments using U937 or HL-60 nuclear extracts but not in any experiments using Jurkat extracts , the complex appeared much more prominent following PMA treatment of the extracts ( Fig .

This result suggests that in addition to the constitutive J. ViroL .

Mutation of the peri- « B site disrupts HIV-2 enhancer activation in monocytes but not in T cells .
HIV-2/CAT constructs containing mutations in the indicated sites were transfected into Jurkat T cells ( A ) , HL-60 monocytic cells ( B ) , or U937 monocytic cells ( C ) .
Mutated sites are illustrated in Fig .

The bars represent percent conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated form either in the absence ( - ) or presence ( + ) of PMA .
Fold activation of the HIV-2 enhancer is derived from the ratio of acetylated chloramphenicol in PMA-treated versus resting cells .
Results shown are the averages of two ( HL-60 , U937 ) or three ( Jurkat ) representative independent experiments .
Experiments were performed at least four times for each cell line .
peri « B DEL , peri- « B DEL ( -114/-127y binding seen in monocytes and T cells , additional binding activity could be induced by PMA treatment of monocytes but not T cells .
To examine whether these findings reflected what is occurring in vivo , peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were isolated and nuclear extracts from these cells were used to perform EMSAs .
A series of specific complexes was seen in EMSAs using unstimulated peripheral blood monocytic nuclear extracts and the peri-kB probe ( Fig .
5A ) .
These complexes were eliminated by competition with an excess of unlabeled peri- « B oligonucleotide but not by a xB oligonucleotide .
EMSAs using peripheral T-cell nuclear extracts showed two specific complexes which were significantly diminished by an unlabeled peri-xB oligonucleotide but not by xB ( Fig .
5B ) .
Of note , the pattern of DNA-protein binding was markedly different between the two cell types , suggesting the possibility of binding by different cell-specific proteins or by a protein ( s ) which is differentially modified in the two cell types , thus altering the binding pattern .
In addition , when peripheral blood monocytes were activated with PMA and nuclear extracts from these cells used in EMSAs , the pattern of DNA-protein binding was dramatically different from that seen in extracts from resting monocytes ( Fig .
5C ) , consistent with the EMSA data from monocytic cell lines , suggesting that both constitutive and inducible peri- « kB binding activity is found in monocytes .
DISCUSSION We have previously demonstrated that regulation of the HIV-2 enhancer in both T cells and monocytes is dependent upon conserved sequences in the LTR including « B , PuB1 , PuB2 , and the pets site ( 35 , 49 , 51 ) .
We have now shown that Vou .

A nuclear factor ( s ) binds to the isolated peri-B site in cell lines .
EMSAs were performed with a peri- « B oligonucleotide probe ( -111 to -137 ) and nuclear extracts from either U937 ( A ) , HL-60 ( B ) , or Jurkat ( C ) cells prepared as described previously ( 14 ) , which were unstimulated ( - ) or activated with PMA ( + ) .
Extracts were incubated with the peri- « B probe alone ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or in the presence of 20 ng of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide ( lanes 3 to 7 ) .
The competitor oligonucleotides are sequences from the HIV-2 enhancer and include the unlabeled peri- « B site , a truncated peri-B site ( -111 to -135 ) indicated as ( C ) in the figure , a B oligonucleotide ( -93 to -114 ) , a mutated « B sequence ( AxB ) ( Fig .
1A ) , and either a PuB1 site ( -151 to -182 ) in panels A and C or a sequence containing a pets site and a mutated PuB2 site ( Fig .
1A ) ( -131 to -162 ) in panel B .
The arrow in each figure indicates the specific DNA-peri- « B factor complex .
in addition to these cis-acting elements there is another functional site , the site , which mediates HIV-2 enhancer activation in monocytic cells but not in T cells .
Mutation of the peri-kB site alone results in a marked reduction in inducible enhancer function in HL-60 and THP-1 monocytic cells , and mutation of the site in combination with a mutated xB site causes significant disruption of enhancer activity in U937 monocytic cells .
The observation that a single mutation in the peri-kB site does not significantly reduce HIV-2 enhancer induction in U937 cells is consistent with previous findings ; we have shown that disabling HIV-2 enhancer function in U937 cells appears to require mutation of more than one enhancer element ( 35 ) .
Through DNase protection analysis and EMSAs , we have further demonstrated that the peri- « B site is bound specifically by one or more nuclear factors ( the peri- « kB factor ) found in monocytes and T cells as well as HeLa cells .
EMSAs using peripheral blood monocyte nuclear extracts show several specific complexes .
Whether these complexes represent binding of multimeric forms or degradation products of a single protein or binding of distinct proteins to the peri- « B site is unknown and will require further investigation .
Compatible with the functional data , the binding pattern seen with T-cell nuclear extracts is different from that seen with monocytic nuclear extracts , and while binding activity is seen in resting monocytic cells , greater activity as well as a change in the binding pattern is seen following stimulation of peripheral blood monocytes with PMA .
Additional studies will be needed to determine the identity of the peri- « B factor .
With the exception of a short motif in the antisense strand ( CTTTG ) , the peri-kB site bears little similarity to the region upstream of kB in the HIV-1 enhancer which is recognized by hLEF/TCF-l « ( 5 , 70 ) .
Furthermore , hLEF/TCF-1 « appears to be specific to lymphoid cells , and the factor recognizing the peri- « B site in the HIV-2 enhancer is present in monocytes and HeLa cells in addition to T cells .
A search of the Transcription Factor Database ( 27 ) for similari- ties between the sequence of the peri-xB site and sequences of known transcription factor binding sites revealed some similarity to two known binding sites .
One of these sites is located in the simian virus 40 enhancer and is known as the GT-IIB motif ( ACAGCTG ; 72 ) , and the other is present in a number of cellular enhancers and binds helix-loop-helix proteins , and is known as the E2-box sequence ( RCAGNTG ; 54 ) .
It is not yet known whether the factors which bind these elements are similar to the peri- « B factor .
A potential interaction of the peri- « B factor with NF- « B in mediating transcriptional activation is suggested by several ob-servations .
The two enhancer sites lie in close proximity to one another in the HIV-2 LTR , and DNase footprint analysis in HeLa cells shows a footprint overlapping both the kB and peri-kB sites .
In addition , the synergistic decline in inducible enhancer function seen when both the xB and peri- « B sites are mutated in U937 cells gives weight to the notion that the peri- « kB factor and NF- « B may interact functionally .
Of note , subunits of NF- « B do not bind directly to the peri- « B site in EMSAs ( 7 ) .
We have demonstrated in EMSAs that DNA binding of the peri- « kB factor is partially inducible ; there is binding in unstimulated monocytes and T cells , but enhanced binding is usually seen in EMSAs using PMA-treated HL-60 and U937 nuclear extracts .
Enhanced binding and an alteration in the binding pattern are consistently seen in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated peripheral blood monocytes .
These results suggest that cellular activation in monocytes causes a posttranslational modification of the peri- « kB factor and/or an interaction of the peri- « B factor with additional cellular proteins leading to enhanced binding and activation of transcription .
These findings would not be incompatible with a posttranslational modification involving , for example , phos-phorylation of the peri- « B factor .
Alternatively or addition-ally , an interaction between the peri- « kB factor and another cellular factor , such as NF-kB , might mediate transcriptional activation .

Specific nuclear factors bind the peri- « B site in peripheral blood monocytes and T cells .
EMSAs were performed as described in the legend to Fig .
4 , using the same probe and nuclear extracts from unstimulated peripheral blood monocytes ( A ) or peripheral blood T cells ( B ) .
Extracts were incubated with the peri- « B probe alone ( lanes 1 in panels A and B ) or in the presence of 20 ng of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide ( lanes 2 and 3 in panels A and B ) .
The competitor oligonucleotides were an unlabeled peri- « B site and a « B oligonucleotide .
( C ) Nuclear extracts from either unstimulated peripheral monocytes ( lane 1 ) or monocytes stimulated with PMA ( lanes 2 to 5 ) were incubated with the peri- « B probe alone ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or in the presence of 20 ng of unlabeled peri- « B oligonucleotide ( lane 3 ) , xB oligonucleotide ( lane 4 ) , or a mutated xB oligonucleotide ( lane 5 ) .
The arrows in each figure indicate the specific DNA-peri- « B factor complexes from uninduced ( A and B ) or induced ( lanes 2 to 5 in panel C ) cell extracts .
The monocyte-specific function of the peri- « kB factor is a significant and unusual feature for an HIV transcriptional enhancer .
In fact , such an enhancer element has not been described previously for HIV-2 nor clearly shown for HIV-1 .
Nakanishi et al .
have described a cis-acting element in the HIV-1 LTR , known as URE ( which spans the site recognized by hLEF/TCF-1 @ ) , which may have cell type-specific function ( 57 ) .
However , the deletion of this element has resulted in only a very modest decrease in transcription in MOLT-4 T cells and U937 cells ( 4.3- and 1.6-fold , respectively ) , and an increase in transcription in other T-cell lines ( 57 ) .
In addition , these studies employed large deletions of the HIV-1 LTR , a technique which modifies the spatial orientation of the enhancer and often removes multiple enhancer elements , making it difficult to interpret the contributions of individual elements .
Several other studies have raised the possibility that another element of the HIV-1 enhancer , the USF binding site , also acts in a cell type-specific manner , but the data thus far appear contradictory ( 45 , 46 , 53 , 73 ) .
Recently , a negative regulatory element of the HIV-2 LTR located upstream of the PuB and pets sites was described , with its effects apparently cell line specific ( 4 ) .
These experiments again used deletion rather than site-specific mu-tants , and deletion of this site resulted in increased basal but not inducible transcription of HIV-2/CAT constructs in CEM cells .
These effects were not seen in U937 cells or HeLa cells , and they did not appear specific to T cells in general , as dele- tion of this site in Jurkat T cells had minimal effect on the basal level of transcription .
Given that the peri- « kB factor is present at least in HeLa cells , T cells , and monocytes , its differential function among cell types can not be explained on the basis of differential expression of a single DNA-binding protein .
However , the means by which the peri- « B factor acts in a cell type-specific manner may be analogous to that described for the transcription factor Oct-1 .
The ubiquitous Oct-1 is a transcriptional activator which binds the octamer motif ATTTGCAT ( for a review , see reference 40 ) and is involved in regulation of a histone H2B gene and the constitutive expression of the small nuclear RNA genes ( 19 , 42 ) .
It has been demonstrated that the ability of Oct-1 to induce high-level , octamer-dependent transcription of immunoglobulin genes is dependent on the presence of a distinct B-cell-specific factor ( 47 , 60 ) , thus providing evidence that interactions of cell type-specific cofactors with ubiquitous transcription factors are a mechanism for tissue-specific function .
The monocyte-specific activity of the peri- « B factor , then , could be explained by its interaction with a cofactor whose expression is restricted to monocytes .
The peri- « B site is an important element of the HIV-2 LTR .
While it binds one or more specific nuclear factors from both T cells and monocytes , its functional activity is apparent in monocytic cells but not T cells .
The monocyte-specific function of this element could be important for understanding the dif- Vou .

Further studies , including purification and cloning of the peri- « B factor , are in progress and should allow a more definitive understanding of the function of the peri- « kB factor in activating HIV-2 transcription , its interaction with other cellular factors , and perhaps its role in normal monocyte physiol- ogy .
