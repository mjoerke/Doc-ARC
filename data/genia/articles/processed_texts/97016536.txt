Received 27 February 1996 Revised version accepted for publication 17 April 1996 J Med Genet 1996 ; 33:682-688 Uneven X inactivation in a female monozygotic twin pair with Fabry disease and discordant expression of a novel mutation in the -galactosidase A gene I Redonnet-Vernhet , J K Ploos van Amstel , R P M Jansen , R A Wevers , R Salvayre , T Levade Abstract We describe two female monozygotic ( MZ ) twins heterozygous for Fabry disease , an X linked disorder resulting from the deficient activity of o-galactosidase A .
While one of the twins was clinically affected , the other was asymptomatic .
Enzymatic assay of o-galactosidase in blood - leucocytes , - skin - fibroblasts , Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoid cell lines , and hair follicles of the twins and their parents confirmed the heterozygous status of the twins and indicated that Fabry disease had occurred as a result of a de novo mutation .
The son of the unaffected twin sister was shown to be hemizygous .
Molecular analysis of the « -galactosidase A gene permitted the identification of an as yet undescribed point mutation at position 10182 of exon 5 which causes an Asp to Asn substitution at codon 231 .
Single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis again showed the heterozygous status of the twins and a normal pattern in their parents .
The basis for the discordant expression of this de novo mutation in the twins was investigated by studying their X inactivation status .
Analysis of the inactive X specific methylation at the androgen receptor gene showed unbalanced inactivation in the twins ' fibroblasts and in opposite directions .
While the maternally derived X chromosome was preferentially active in the asymptomatic twin , the paternal X chromosome was active in the other , affected twin and was found in her hemizygotic nephew .
These data suggest that the paternal X chromosome carries the de novo o-galactosidase A mutation and that uneven X inactivation is the underlying mechanism for disease expression in this novel female MZ twin pair .
This is the first documented case of female twins discordant for Fabry disease .
( J Med Genet 1996 ; 331:682-688 ) Key words : Fabry disease ; X inactivation ; monozygotic twins .
In female mammals , compensation for sex differences in the dosage of most X chromosomal genes occurs during early embryogenesis through X inactivation . '
'' This phenomenon results in selective , irreversible inactivation of either the maternal or the paternal X chromosome of each somatic cell .
Since X inactivation occurs at random and is maintained in all daughter cells , females exhibit a mosaic pattern of expression of X linked genes , each X chromosome being active in about half of all somatic cells .
However , if one X chromosome is predominantly inactivated in a female heterozygous for an X linked trait , this may lead to severe manifestation of the X linked disorder .
Such a situation can be observed in female monozygotic ( MZ ) twins who are heterozygous for an X linked disorder .
In all the pairs ( 22 ) of heterozygous identical female twins published so far , `` there was discordant expression of the disease , that is , only one twin was clinically affected , which is interpreted as the consequence of skewed X inactivation in opposite directions in each of the MZ twins .
Since expression of an X linked disorder in both female twins has never been described , an interrelation between twinning and X inactivation has been postulated .
* `` In this study , we report the occurrence of female MZ twins with discordant expression of Fabry disease .
Anderson-Fabry disease ( MIM 301500 ) is an X linked disorder caused by the deficient activity of the lysosomal exoglycohy-drolase , « -galactosidase A ( EC 3.2.1.22 ) . ``
The gene encoding -galactosidase A , which contains seven exons and extends over 12 kb , is localised on the long arm of the X chromosome - ( Xq22 ) . ``
`` ~ In - addition , - the « -galactosidase A gene has previously been shown to be affected by X inactivation . ``
Loss of this enzyme activity results in the progressive lysosomal storage of glycosphingolipids with terminal - o-galactose - residues .
- Affected hemizygous males accumulate mainly globo-triosylceramide and galabiosylceramide within the vascular endothelium .
Clinical manifestations include angiokeratoma , pain in the extremities , corneal opacities , renal failure , and vascular disease of the heart and brain .
Most heterozygous females are clinically asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms ( the most frequent being characteristic keratopathy ) , although some heterozygotes have been reported to be as severely affected as hemizygous males . ``
While Fabry disease in males can be definitively diagnosed by demonstration of Discordant expression of Fabry disease in MZ twins Table 1 _ Short tandem repeat ( STR ) analysis of the twin sisters Patient Chromosome STR locus location I1 1.2 11.2 11.3 HPRT Xq26 283 287 ; 287 283 ; 287 283 ; 287 FABP2 4q28-q31 206 ; 206 215 ; 218 206 ; 215 206 ; 215 CSFIR 5q33-q34 308 ; 308 308 ; 312 308 ; 308 308 ; 308 TH 11p15.5 183 ; 193 199 ; 199 193 ; 199 193 ; 199 PLAZA 12q23-qter 121 ; 127 119 ; 121 121 ; 127 121 ; 127 F13A1 6p24-p25 281 ; 293 290 ; 290 290 ; 293 290 ; 293 CYP19 15q21.1 175 ; 175 175 ; 175 175 ; 175 175 ; 175 LPL 8p22 124 ; 124 120 ; 128 124 ; 128 124 ; 128 FES 15q25-qter 143 ; 151 147 ; 155 147 ; 151 147 ; 151 VWF 12p13 166 ; 170 154 ; 162 162 ; 166 162 ; 166 Allele identification was achieved as described in the Methods section .

deficient -galactosidase A activity , enzymatic identification of female carriers is often inconclusive because of the very wide range of -galactosidase A activity levels owing to the random X chromosomal inactivation phenom-enon .
We report here for the first time the enzymatic and molecular identification , as well as the characterisation of the X inactivation status , of female MZ twins discordant for Fabry disease .
Family history The clinical and pathological features of this Fabry disease family have been described in detail elsewere . '
'' `` Briefly , a 26 year old woman ( patient IL2 , fig 1 ) was investigated on the basis of angiokeratomas , with the characteristic `` swimsuit `` distribution .
The history indicated the onset of symptoms at the age of 16 years , with a progressive course including acroparaes-thesia in all four limbs .
Further evaluation of the patient showed isolated proteinuria and the presence of a verticillate cornea and vascular tortuosities on optic fundus examination .
Electron microscopy of the skin and renal biopsies showed the typical pattern of concentric , lamellar inclusions and thin layer chromato-graphic analysis of the urine showed large amounts of tri- and dihexosylceramide .
The twin sister ( II.3 ) showed no skin lesions .
No verticillate cornea was found and there was no history of acroparaesthesia .
Only some vacuolated endothelial cells in a skin biopsy and trace amounts of trihexosylceramide were found . '
'' Monozygosity was strongly suspected on the basis of the physical similarities , finger prints , and identity of erythrocyte and HLA groups . ``
Screening of the rest of the family indicated that the son of the unaffected twin ( patient III.2 ) was hemizygous .

Nucleotide sequence determination The amplified DNA was purified by ultralow gelling temperature gel electrophoresis .
The excised fragments were directly sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination reaction with a pUC sequencing kit ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) , using [ « - ( 600 Ci/mmol ) .
The amplification primers were used as primers in the sequencing reaction .
Single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) SSCP was identified by automated electrophoresis on 12.5 % homogeneous PhastGels ( Pharmacia-LKB ) with native bufferstrips for 200 Vh at 4°C according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
The DNA was visualised by silver staining .
Analysis of X inactivation patterns The X inactivation pattern analysis was performed by studying the methylation of the Hhal sites in the first exon of the human androgen receptor locus as previously reported . ``

The size of the amplified fragments averaged 280 bp , which corresponds to 11-31 CAG repeat units . ``
Results CYTOGENETIC AND POLYMORPHISM STUDIES Cytogenetic analysis showed normal karyo-types in both twins .
The sisters shared the same alleles for all STR markers tested .
Product length of each marker is shown in table 1 for both parents and the sisters .
The PLAZA , VWF , and FES markers were informative for both parents , the CYP19 marker was not informative , and the other six markers were informative for a single parent .
From these data ft can be calculated that the sisters II.2 and II.3 are monozygotic twins with a probability of 99.98 % .
( -GALACTOSIDASE ENZYME STUDIES As illustrated in table 2 , both the clinically affected woman ( patient II.2 ) and her clinically unaffected MZ twin sister ( patient II.3 ) exhibited clearly reduced levels of -galactosidase activity in various cell types , indicating their heterozygous status for the Fabry trait .
The fact that the non-manifesting twin was indeed a carrier for Fabry disease was confirmed by the finding that her son ( IIL2 ) had severe ( -galactosidase activity deficiency , consistent with a hemizygous status .
Normal total « -galactosidase and -galactosidase A `` activities were found in both the mother and father of the twins ( table 2 ) as well as in other members of this family . ``
The heterozygous status of the twins was further confirmed by analysing the enzyme activities in single hair follicles .
As shown in fig 2 , the twin sisters had some hair follicle values in the normal range ( fig 2 ( left ) for female con-trols ) but also values distinctly below the normal range , that is , in the range of the hemizygous son ( III.2 ) .
These data provide further evidence for the heterozygous status of the twins .
In contrast , none of the 25 hair roots analysed in their mother ( 1.2 ) showed abnormal ( intermediate or deficient ) -galactosidase activity ( fig 2 , right ) .
The enzymatic data therefore suggest that Fabry disease in the twins occurred as a result of a de novo mutation .

This suggests that if the gene defect of the proband is located in the amplified fragments , it is too small to be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis .
We then determined the nucleotide sequence of all the amplified fragments .
A single alteration was found .
At position 10182 of exon 5 of the « -galactosidase A gene ( GenBank accession No X14448 ) a G to A transition has occurred ( fig 3 ) .
This alteration causes an Asp to Asn amino acid substitution at codon 231 of the gene .
The segregation of the G10182A mutation was followed in the pedigree by SSCP .

ANALYSIS OF THE X INACTIVATION PATTERN Analysis of the methylation of the Hhal sites adjacent to the highly polymorphic CAG repeat ( 90 % heterozygosity ) of the human androgen receptor gene was informative and was performed on cultured skin fibroblasts ( fig 5A ) and lymphoid cells ( fig 5B ) from the twins .
In this assay , DNA is digested with kal before PCR amplification of the polymorphic repeat .
Only methylated alleles , present on an inactive X chromosome , can be amplified . ``

DNA samples from cultured skin fibroblasts and lymphoid cell lines of the patients were PCR amplified as described in Methods , after preincubation in the absence ( lanes - ) or presence ( lanes + ) ) of Hhal .
The androgen receptor alleles in the twins ' fibroblasts ( A ) or lymphoid cells ( B ) are compared to those of the lymphoid cells from the rest of the family .
In fibroblasts , densitometric analysis of digested alleles indicated ratios of 0:100 and 97:3 for the paternal : maternal alleles in the affected ( II .
2 ) and unaffected ( II .
3 ) twin sisters , respectively .
In lymphoid cells ( B ) after digestion , ratios of 12:88 and 37:63 were obtained for the manifesting and unaffected twins , respectively .
Similar results were obtained in five to 10 separate experiments .
interpretation of the X inactivation status only when perfectly random or almost 100 % skewed patterns are obtained . ``
Fig 5A shows the various alleles in the Fabry twins ' fibroblasts .
PCR without previous Hhal digestion was also performed on lymphoid cells from the parents and the affected child .
The alleles in the undigested samples were of approximately equal intensity .
Methylation patterns of the twins were determined by comparing the intensity of the paternal and maternal alleles in samples that had been digested with the restriction endonuclease .
A skewed methylation pattern in opposite directions was apparent in the fibroblast DNA samples from the twins ( fig 5A ) .
In one twin ( II.2 ) , the ratio of paternal : maternal alleles after HhaI digestion was 0:100 while this ratio was 97:3 in the other twin ( II.3 ) .
From this methylation pattern , it can be concluded that the paternal X chromosome is preferentially active in the Fabry diseased twin and that the maternal X chromosome is active in the unaffected sister .
Since the X chromosome active in the affected twin ( IL.2 ) and the Fabry hemizygote ( IIL.2 ) is of paternal origin , our data also suggest that the de novo mutation occurred in the twins ' father .
In contrast to fibroblast samples , analysis of DNA extracted from lymphoid cell lines of the twins did not show opposite inactivation patterns , but a slightly preferential inactivation of the maternal X chromosome in both twins ( fig 5B ) .
These data are in good agreement with the « -galactosidase activity levels measured in the two types of cells ( table 2 ) : while a clear difference in the activity levels between the twins was apparent in the fibroblasts , quite similar values ( slightly below the heterozygote range ) were observed in lymphoid cell ho-mogenates .
Discussion This study reports a French family with Fabry disease resulting from an as yet undescribed mutation .
A series of molecular lesions in the « -galactosidase A gene causing Fabry disease have been reported . ``
`` `` * Most of these mutations are private and include exonic gene rearrangements , small deletions and insertions , mRNA processing defects , and single base substitutions .
The single point mutation we identified causes a change in the charge of the amino acid chain and is therefore very likely to affect the -galactosidase structure or function or both .
A similar substitution has already been described in exon 5 at codon 244 . ``
The findings of our enzymatic and molecular studies suggest that in the present family , the mutant allele arose in a gamete of the grandfather .
To our knowledge , this report is the third example of Fabry disease resulting from a de novo mutation .
Indeed , out of the many mutations identified in Fabry disease , only two instances of de novo mutations have been reported , one partial deletion `` and one complex mutation in exon 5 . ``
Analysis of the polymorphism at the human androgen receptor locus indicated that the Fabry mutation found in the twins and the hemizygous child was carried by the X chromosome inherited from the grandfather , suggesting that the de Discordant expression of Fabry disease in MZ twins novo mutation in the MZ twins was of paternal origin .
Whether this defect occurred during meiosis or earlier in mitosis of the germ cells ( causing gonadal mosaicism ) remains to be elucidated .
Monozygosity of the twins was established on the basis of several criteria .
In addition to the physical similarities and identity of erythrocyte and HLA groups , `` `` the twin sisters shared the same pattern of polymorphic STR markers ( table 1 ) .
Although monozygotic , the twins exhibited discordant expression of Fabry disease .
While they were both shown to be heterozygous for ( -galactosidase A deficiency , only one twin had clinical signs and symptoms of Fabry disease .
Two other female twin pairs heterozygous for Fabry disease have previously been reported in an English `` `` and a Dutch `` family .
Although their monozygosity has not been established , these patients also seemed to exhibit different expression of the disease . ``
The observed phenotypic discordance between the twins could be explained by X inactivation dissimilarities .
Indeed , uneven lyonisa-tion between the twin sisters , that is , a different pattern of X inactivation at the androgen receptor locus , was found in skin fibroblasts .
This type of analysis clearly showed that the paternally derived X chromosome was active in most skin cells of the Fabry diseased twin while the maternally derived X was active in the unaffected twin .
This X inactivation pattern is likely to occur also in the target cells of Fabry disease , that is , endothelial and smooth muscle cells , `` since the latter cells and skin fibroblasts have the same mesodermal origin .
While completely opposite inactivation patterns were noted in skin fibroblasts of our twins , the patterns of methylation in the lymphoid cells were not perfectly random but were comparable in both sisters .
Several hypotheses may account for the discrepancy between the two cell types .
First , different tissues may show different patterns of X inactivation .
Second , a selective effect in vitro may have resulted in significant clonal outgrowth of lymphoblasts in culture , as previously re-ported .
`` * Finally , it has been postulated that the random inactivation status in lymphocytes could result from shared fetal circulation of lymphocyte precursors . ``
Accordingly , analysis of the X inactivation patterns in a cell type other than cultured fibroblasts or lymphob-lasts , for example , peripheral blood leucocytes or lymphocytes , was not performed because concordant patterns of methylation in lymphocytes ( but not in the skin ) have previously been reported in a twin pair ' and because one of our twins is no longer available .
Discordant expression of X linked disorders in monozygotic twin females has been reported in at least 22 female twin pairs heterozygous for Duchenne muscular dystrophy , deuter-anomaly , G6PD deficiency , haemophilia B , fragile X syndrome , and Hunter disease .
* `` Our observation adds another twin pair with markedly different X inactivation patterns for an hitherto - undescribed X linked _ trait , -galactosidase A deficiency .
Thus , as previ- 687 ously noted , `` '° it appears that concordant expression of ( at least seven ) X linked disorders in MZ female heterozygotes has never been reported .
This finding has led to the pos-tulation that MZ twinning events and uneven X inactivation are connected . ``
*** * Indeed , if X inactivation occurred independently in each female MZ twin , creation of opposite patterns of non-random X inactivation would be unlikely .
Accordingly , it seems that X inactivation precedes MZ twinning , and that predominant inactivation of the normal X in one of the twins frequently accompanies the twinning process .
One possible mechanism for non-randomness would be the asymmetrical splitting of the inner cell mass . ``
