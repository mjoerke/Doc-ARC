One hour pulse-treatment with 3 uM etoposide caused topoisomerase-asso-ciated , primary DNA breakage , which was rapidly followed by apoptosis .
By contrast , these effects were not observed upon pulse-treatment with 6 uM ICRF-193 .
However , continuous treatments with subcytotoxic concentrations of etoposide ( 0.15 uM ) and ICRF-193 ( 0.3 uM ) produced several similar effects , namely decreased cell proliferation , accumulation of cells at G3 , increase in cell mass , and induction of differentiation .
Under these conditions , etoposide produced a biphasic activation of protein kinase C , which consisted in an early transient activation ( from hours 1 to 6 ) of the membrane-bound enzyme followed by a later activation ( hour 48 ) of the total , membrane-bound and cytosolic enzyme .
By contrast , ICRF-193 only provoked a late activation ( from hours 72 to 96 ) of the total enzyme .
When used at differentiation-inducing concentrations , both topoisomerase inhibitors caused a great stimulation of AP-1 binding activity , with maximum value at hour 12 in etoposide-treated cells and at hour 48 in ICRF-193-treated cells .
By contrast , the binding activity of the NF- « B and EGR-1 transcription factors was little affected .
It is concluded that topoisomerase II inhibitors may induce the differentiation of promonocytic cells , independently of their capacity to cause DNA strand breaks .
However , there are other effects , such as the early activation of protein kinase C , which are probably derived from the production of primary DNA breakage by some anti-topoisomerase drugs .
Key words : Etoposide , ICRF-193 , Topoisomerase II inhibition , Differentiation , Apoptosis , U-937 cell INTRODUCTION DNA topoisomerases are enzymes capable of generating local changes in DNA topology which are required for DNA repli-cation , transcription , recombination and chromatid segregation ( Vosberg , 1985 ) .
In addition , these enzymes are targets for an important number of antitumour drugs .
This is the case for DNA intercalating agents , such as amsacrine , doxorubicin and mitoxantrone , and of non intercalators , such as the epipodophyllotoxins etoposide ( VP-16 ) and teniposide ( VM-26 ) .
These agents cause the stabilization of the cleavable DNA-topoisomerase II covalent complexes , preventing subsequent DNA religation and producing 'primary ' , topoisomerase-asso-ciated DNA strand breaks ( D'Arpa and Liu , 1989 ) .
When the drugs are applied at high concentrations , the primary DNA breakage may be rapidly followed by 'secondary ' , nucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation , characteristic of apoptosis ( Bertrand et al .
, 1993 ) .
Nevertheless , the anti-topoisomerase drugs may also induce differentiation when applied at subcytotoxic concentrations .
This has been mainly demonstrated in myeloid and erythroid cells ( Rappa et al .
, 1990 ; Rius et al .
, 1991 ; Constantinou et al .
, 1992 ) , but also in other systems such as mouse embryonal carcinoma cells ( Kondo et al .
, 1991 ) and neuroblastoma cells ( Larcher et al .
, 1992 ) .
One of the problems derived from the use of 'classical ' topoisomerase inhibitors is that , because of the inevitable production of DNA breakage , it is impossible to know whether the observed effects are due to topoisomerase inhibition itself or to the drug-generated DNA damage .
Actually , it has been reported that DNA-damaging agents which do not inhibit topoisomerase activity , such as X-radiation , cytarabine and alkylating agents , may induce differentiation in several cell systems ( Wangenheim and Howard , 1978 ; Mata et al .
, 1989 ; Ballester et al .
, 1996 ) .
To shed light on this problem , we have compared the action of etoposide and the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-193 .
ICRF-193 338 - C. Pérez and others and related compounds represent a novel class of DNA topoisomerase inhibitors with antitumour activity which do not stabilize the cleavable complex ( Tanabe et al .
, 1991 ) .
Instead , they stabilize the enzyme in the form of a closed protein clamp ( Roca et al .
, 1994 ) , in such a manner that the cells do not accumulate DNA breakage .
Our results indicate that in spite of their different mechanisms of action , both etoposide and ICRF-193 induce the differentiation of U-937 human promonocytic cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and drug treatments The U-937 cells ( Sundstrom and Nilsson , 1976 ) used were mycoplasma-free .
The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 ( Gibco BRL : Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) supplemented with 10 % heat-inacti-vated fetal calf serum ( Gibco BRL ) , 5 mM Hepes buffer , and 0.2 % sodium bicarbonate in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere at 37°C .
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) and etoposide , obtained from Sigma Quimica , Madrid , Spain , were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) at 1.5 and 20 mM , respectively .
ICRF-193 , synthesized in one of our laboratories ( St Bartholomew 's Hospital , London , UK ) , was dissolved at 10 mM in DMSO .
The solutions were stored at -20°C .
At the final concentrations used , the solvent was without significant effects on cell growth and differentiation .
Cells were seeded for experiments in a mixture of old and fresh media ( 1:3 , v/v ) at 10° cells/ml .
Under these conditions , the doubling time of the cells in untreated cultures was approximately 18 hours .
Cells from control cultures were harvested at the exponential growth phase .
Cells from treated cultures were harvested at the times indicated in each experiment .
To prevent long-term cultures from reaching plateau densities or nutrient exhaustion , at the second day of treatment ( approximately 6-7 % 10° cells/ml in untreated cultures ) they were supplemented with an equal volume of fresh medium containing the corresponding drug .
Cell growth and viability were checked using a hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion , respectively .
Alkaline elution assays Cells were incubated for 20 hours in the presence of 0.1 uCi/ml of methyl [ » HIJthymidine ( 2 Ci/mmol , Amersham Iberica , Madrid , Spain ) plus 1 uM of unlabeled thymidine , after which they were washed twice and allowed to recover in RPMI medium for 1 hour at 37°C in the absence of the precursor .
Following drug treatment or irra-diation , the frequency of total ( single plus double ) DNA breaks was estimated by DNA-denaturing alkaline solution ( pH 12.1 ) following the method of Kohn et al .
( 1981 ) .
Determination of apoptosis Determination of DNA degradation by agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out by the method of Rubin et al .
( 1991 ) .
To analyze changes in nuclear structure , 5x10° cells were collected , washed with PBS , resuspended in 50 pul PBS and mounted on glass slides .
After fixation for 20 minutes in cold absolute methanol , the cells were stained for 20 minutes at room temperature with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI , at 1 ug/ml in phosphate buffered saline , PBS ) , and examined by fluorescence microscopy .
Determination of DNA content and cell mass Simultaneous measurement of DNA content ( as a determination of cell cycle distribution ) and total protein content ( as an estimation of cell mass ) was carried out by double staining of the cells with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate , followed by their analysis by flow cytometry , as earlier described ( Aller et al .
, 1992 ) .
Measurement of differentiation markers To determine nitro blue tetrazolium ( NBT ) reduction , 106 cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C in 1 ml PBS containing 0.1 % NBT and 150 nM TPA , after which 0.2 ml of 5 N HCI was added and the cells left for 1 hour at room temperature .
Upon centrifugation , the formazan precipitates were dissolved in 0.5 ml DMSO and the absorbance measured by spectrometry at 560 nm .
The surface expression of the CR3 ( CD11b/CD18 ) and p150,95 ( CD11c/CD18 ) leukocyte integrins was determined by indirect immunofluorescence combined with flow cytometry , and the intracellular accumulation of the intermediate filament protein vimentin measured by immunoblot assays , as previously described ( Mata et al .
, 1989 ) .
Protein kinase C assays Cells ( 5x10° ) were collected , washed with PBS , and suspended in 0.4 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCI , pH 7.5 , containing 0.5 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM EGTA , 25 ug/ml aprotinin , and 25 pg/ml leupeptin ) .
The cells were disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer , after which the homogenates were first centrifuged for 2 minutes in a microfuge to remove the cellular debris and then in an ultracentrifuge for 30 minutes at 100,000 g. The pellets ( membrane fractions ) were resuspended in extraction buffer containing 0.5 % Triton X-100 and kept for 30 minutes on ice with occasional vortexing , after which they were centrifuged for 10 minutes in a microfuge to collect the super-natants .
The cytosolic fractions and the detergent-extracted membrane fractions were eluted at 4°C with 2 ml elution buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HC ] , pH 7.5 , containing 0.5 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM EGTA , 0.2 M NaCl , and 10 mM B-mercaptoethanol ) in DEAE-cellulose columns .
PKC activities were determined with the Protein Kinase C Assay System ( Gibco/BRL , Grand Island , NY ) , according to the instructions described by the manufacturer .
This assay system uses as phosphate acceptor the myelin basic protein sequence Arg-Ser-Lys-Leu ( MBP4-14 ) , which is considered to be highly specific for the PKC-B and PKC -y subspecies ( Yasuda et al .
, 1990 ) .
Gel retardation assays Nuclear extracts from 1-2x10 `` cells were prepared according to the method of Schreibert et al .
( 1988 ) and stored at -70°C .
Partially complementary oligonucleotide pairs were synthesized in a Gene Assembler Plus ( Pharmacia LKB , Uppsala , Sweden ) and used to prepare double-strand oligonucleotides containing AP-1- , NF-KB-and EGR-l-recognizing sequences .
The oligonucleotides were : for AP-1 , _ 5-GGCTAGTGATGAGTCAAGCCGGATC-3 ' and 5'-GGGATCCGGCTTGACTCATCACTAG-3 ' ; for NF- « B , 5-GATC-GAGGGGACTTTCCCTAGC-3 ' and 5-GGGCTAGGGAAAGTCC-CCTCGA-3 ' , and for EGR-1 5-GGATCCCGGCGCGGGGGC-GACGGCGT-3 ' and 5-GGACGCCCTCGCCCCCGCGc-CGGGAT-3 ' .
The probes were labeled with [ & -°°P ] dCTP following the method of Sambrook et al .
( 1989 ) .
The binding reactions were carried out for 15 minutes at room temperature in the case of AP-1 , and for 20 minutes at 20°C in the case of NF-KB and EGR-1 , in 20 pul of the corresponding binding buffer containing 5 ng of the labeled probe , 8 ug of total nuclear proteins , 2 ug of poly ( dI : dC ) , and 2 ug of salmon sperm DNA .
The binding buffers were : for AP-1 , 25 mM NaCl , 60 mM KCl , 2 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 2 % Ficoll , 0.1 % ( w/v ) Nonidet P-40 , 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , 25 mM 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid ( Hepes ) , pH 7.4 ; for NF-KB , 5 mM MgCl » , 0.5 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 10 % ( v/v ) glycerol , 25 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.6 ; and for EGR-1 , 70 mM KCI , 5 rmiM MgC12 , 0.1 mM ZnCl » , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.05 % ( w/v ) NP-40 , 12 % ( v/v ) glycerol , 1 mg/ml BSA , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.5 .
To examine the specificity of binding , cells were treated for 6 hours with 15 nM TPA , and the reactions were carried out as follows : in the case of AP-1 , in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled probe , and in the presence of 1 pul polyclonal anti-jun antibody or pre-immune serum ( kindly donated by Dr R. Bravo , Bristol-Myers Squibb , Princeton , USA ) ; in the case of NF-KB , in the absence or presence of unlabeled probe , and in the presence of 1 ug anti-NF-xB p50 or anti-NF- « B p65 antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) or preimmune serum ; and in the case of EGR-1 , in the absence or presence of unlabeled probe .
The samples were electrophoresed in 4 % polyacryl-amide gels , and the gels dried and autoradiographed .
RESULTS DNA damage and apoptosis Fig .
1 shows the capacity of a 1 hour pulse-treatment with etoposide ( 0.15 and 3 uM ) and ICRF-193 ( 0.3 and 6 uM ) to cause primary , topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage in U-937 cells , as determined by alkaline elution assays .
The concentration of 0.15 uM etoposide , which as indicated below is a subcytotoxic concentration , sufficed to cause detectable DNA breakage .
At a concentration of 3 uM , the drug-produced breakage was equivalent to more than 10 Gy .
By contrast , ICRF-193 failed to provoke DNA breaks at all concentrations tested .
In addition , etoposide pulse-treatment rapidly induced nucleosome-sized DNA degradation and changes in nuclear structure , characteristic of apoptosis ( Fig .
2A ) , and a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation , measured by cell number increase ( Fig .
2B ) .
By contrast , none of these effects were observed in cells pulse-treated with ICRF-193 ( Fig .
2A , B ) .
These results confirm the different mechanism of action of etoposide and ICRF-193 in U-937 cells , as earlier demonstrated in other cell lines ( Ishida et al .
, 1991 ; Beere et al .
, 1996 ) .
Cell cycle alterations and differentiation induction It was previously demonstrated that continuous treatments with subcytotoxic concentrations of etoposide and other topoisomerase II inhibitors which generate DNA strand breaks ( amsacrine , doxorubicin and mitoxantrone ) induced U-937 cell differentiation ( Rius et al .
, 1991 ; Pérez et al .
, 1994 ) .
For this reason , we wanted to determine whether ICRF-193 , which did not cause DNA breakage , was also able to trigger differen- 1.0 Q\ : g ?

Differentiation by etoposide and ICRF-193 - 339 tiation .
Preliminary assays indicated that the concentrations of ( 0.15 uM etoposide and 0.3 uM ICRF-193 decreased U-937 cell proliferation to a similar extent ( Fig .
3A , upper graph ) .
At the third day of treatment more than 80 % of the cells excluded trypan blue , and those with the morphological characteristics of apoptosis only amounted to 23 % and 14 % in etoposide- and ICRF-193-treated cultures , respectively ( Fig .
3A ) .
Hence , the concentrations of 0.15 uM etoposide and 0.3 uM ICRF-193 were considered to be subcytotoxic and adopted for further experiments .
Under these conditions , both etoposide and ICRF-193 increased the proportion of cells with 4C DNA ICRF E0 .

Differentiation was determined by measuring the surface expression of the CD11b/CD18 ( Hickstein et al .
, 1989 ) and CD11c/CD18 ( Dudley et al .
, 1989 ) leukocyte integrins , the reduction of NBT ( Collins et al .
, 1980 ) , and the accumulation of the intermediate filament vimentin ( Rius and Aller , 1992 ) .
The results in Fig .
4 indicate that , in spite of their different mechanism of action , both ICRF-193 and etoposide induced the expression of these differentiation markers .
At the used concentrations , their expression was more rapid in etoposide-treated cells than in ICRF-193-treated .
Protein kinase C activity Earlier works indicated that myeloid differentiation inducers ( Makowske et al .
, 1988 ; Ahihara et al .
, 1991 ) as well as DNA damaging agents ( Posada et al .
, 1989 ; Rubin et al .
, 1992 ) stimulated PKC activity .
For these reasons , we wanted to measure PKC activity in U-937 cells induced to differentiate with 0.15 LM etoposide and 0.3 uM ICRF-193 .
The results are represented in Fig .
5 .
Etoposide produced an early , transient activation of membrane-bound PKC ( from hours 1 to 6 ) .
Such an activation does not appear to involve enzyme translocation from cytosol to membranes , since the activity of the cytosolic fraction remained unaltered .
This contrasts with the action of the phorbol ester TPA , a powerful differentiation inducer of myeloid cells ( Collins , 1987 ) which causes PKC activation by eliciting enzyme translocation ( Mezetti et al .
, 1987 , and results in this work ) .
Instead , etoposide might selectively activate the pool of inactive enzyme residing on the membrane , as has been described in DMSO-treated myeloid cells ( Durkin et al .
, 1992 ) .
Whatever the case , the early PKC activation was not observed in cells treated with ICRF-193 .
However , the two topoisomerase inhibitors stimulated the activity of the total , membrane-bound plus cytosolic enzyme , when applied for prolonged treatment periods ( 48 hours in the case of etoposide and 72 hours in the case of ICRF-193 ) .
Transcription factor activity It was earlier reported that DNA damaging agents stimulated 1 2 3 Days of treatment Ratio protein/ ONA the binding activity of Jun/AP-1 , NF- « B and EGR-1 ( Brach et al .
, 1991 ; Hallahan et al .
, 1991 ; Rubin et al .
, 1991 ) .
In addition , these transcription factors seemed to be involved in the differentiation induction of myeloid cells by TPA ( Hass et al .
, 1992 ) .
For these reasons , we wanted to examine the binding of these transcription factors in U-937 cells treated for 3 to 48 hours with 0.15 uM etoposide .
The results are shown in Fig .

By contrast , the binding of EGR-1 was only slightly increased at hours 12 and 24 ( a twofold increase , approximately ) , and that of NF-KB was not significantly affected .

Measurements of transcription factor activities in cells induced to differentiate with 0.3 uM ICRF-193 revealed that this agent also stimulated AP-1 binding , albeit at a later time ( 48 hours ) than in the case of etoposide .
ICRF-193 failed to significantly increase NF-KB and EGR-1 binding activities ( results not shown ) .
DISCUSSION The present results demonstrate that pulse-treatment of U-937 promonocytic cells with high concentrations of etoposide cause topoisomerase-mediated DNA breakage , which is rapidly followed by the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation .
By contrast , none of these effects are provoked by pulse-treatment with ICRF-193 .
These observations confirm the different mechanism of action of etoposide and ICRF-193 in U-937 cells , as previously demonstrated in RPMI 8402 T lymphoblastoid cells ( Ishida et al .
, 1991 ) and HL-60 promyelocytic cells ( Beere et al .

WW « @ - p50-p50 ii n ddidin ii ( ig 342 C. Pérez and others have also reported a different action of etoposide and ICRF-193 on cell cycle progression from G2 to mitosis in several cell types ( Ishida et al .
, 1994 ) .
It must be noted that prolonged treatments with differentiation-inducing concentrations of both etoposide and ICRF-193 caused the death by apoptosis of a small fraction of cells .
Nevertheless , under these conditions apoptosis might be a process associated with cell differentiation , as earlier reported ( Cotter et al .
, 1994 ) , or a secondary response to specific cell cycle perturbation , as discussed below .
In spite of the differencies in the primary mechanism of action , both etoposide and ICRF-193 induce the expression of differentiation markers in U-937 cells .
This result rules out the possibility that differentiation could merely be a response to the DNA breakage produced by classical anti-topoisomerase drugs .
A possible explanation migth be that topoisomerase inhibition itself triggers differentiation , as earlier proposed by Nakaya et al .
( 1991 ) .
Nevertheless , this hypothesis must be considered with caution , since there are topoisomerase II inhibitors , such as aclarubicin , which failed to induced U-937 cell differentiation ( Pérez et al .
, 1994 ) .
As an alternative expla-nation , Wangenheim and Howard ( 1978 ) proposed that differentiation may be a consequence of the generation of 'unbal-anced growth ' , defined as an abnormally high ratio of cell mass to DNA content .
This hypothesis seems to be corroborated by the results in Table 1 , which shows a correlation between production of unbalanced growth and differentiation induction by several types of cytostatic drugs .
Interestingly , the generation of unbalanced growth was also proposed by other authors as a cause of apoptosis ( Kung et al .
, 1990 ; Rubin et al .
, 1993 ) .
Hence , an integrative hypothesis is that the disruption of cell cycle events caused by some topoisomerase inhibitors and other cytostatic drugs forces the cells to leave the proliferation program and enter into differentiation or apoptosis .
The elected pathway probably depends on the particular circumstance of each cell and the severity of the treatment .
The possibility that PKC could mediate differentiation by anti-topoisomerase drugs was earlier suggested by Constantinou et al .
( 1989 ) , who showed that novobiocin caused differentiation of TPA-sensitive but not of TPA-resistant HL-60 cells , and that the PKC inhibitor H7 prevented the induction of differentiation by novobiocin .
Our results directly demonstrate Table 1 .

that both etoposide and ICRF-193 stimulate the total , membrane-bound plus cytosolic enzyme in the long term .
Such a late activation of PKC , which was also observed with other differentiation inducers ( Makowske et al .
, 1988 ; Aihara et al .
, 1991 ) , could represent a requirement for the progression of differentiation ( Aihara et al .
, 1991 ) .
In addition , etoposide caused an early , transient stimulation of membrane-bound PKC .
Interestingly , a similar response was elicited by typical differentiation inducers such as TPA and DMSO ( Mezetti et al .
, 1987 ; Durkin et al .
, 1992 ) .
In spite of it , early PKC activation does not appear to be a requirement for differentiation , since it was not observed in cells treated with differentiation-inducing concentrations of ICRF-193 .
Instead , it might represent a response to the drug-generated DNA breakage .
In fact , a similar result was obtained upon treatment of myeloid cells with other DNA damaging agents ( Hallahan et al .
, 1991 ; Ballester et al .
, 1996 ) .
Finally , the present results demonstrate that subcytotoxic , differentiation-inducing concentrations of etoposide and ICREF-193 greatly stimulate AP-1 binding activity .
This observation supports earlier conclusions on the importance of AP-1-regulated genes for the differentiation of myeloid cells .
However , the treatments caused a poor stimulation of EGR-1 binding and null stimulation of NF-KB binding , which contrasts with the great activation caused by the differentiation inducer TPA ( Hass et al .
, 1992 ) .
These observations suggest that the response of these transcription factors depends on the inducer used , and that NF-KB ( and also probably EGR-1 ) are not neccessarily involved in the differentiation induction of promonocytic cells .
It must be noted that high concentrations of etoposide ( 3 uM or more ) stimulated NF-KB binding in HL-60 ( Bessho et al .
, 1994 ) and U-937 cells ( L. Garcia-Bermejo et al .
, unpublished ) .
However , under these conditions the drug rapidly induces apoptosis instead of differentiation .
In summary , it is concluded that DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors may cause myeloid cell differentiation , independently of their capacity to generate DNA strand breaks .
Differentiation is probably facilitated by the cell cycle perturbations caused by the drugs .
However , there are effects , such as the rapid induction of apoptosis or the early activation of PKC , which seem to be derived from the production of primary DNA breakage by some anti-topoisomerase drugs .
