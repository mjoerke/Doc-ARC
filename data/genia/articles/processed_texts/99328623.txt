INTRODUCTION Among renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) patients , 30 % have metastases at the time of diagnosis .
Two-year survival rate of RCC patient is 10-20 % ( 1 , 2 ) .
Metastatic RCC is ordinarily resistant to both radiation therapy and chemotherapy ( 3 ) .
Although the development of immuno-therapy , including interfefon- @ , interleukin-2 and inter-leukin-12 has resulted in improved response rates in metastatic RCC , the treatment of metastatic RCC remains difficult with less than 25 % of patients responding favorably ( 4 ) .
Several mechanisms contribute to the immune unresponsiveness of cancer patients , including immune suppression directly induced by the cancer through its production of soluble immune suppressive factors ( 5 ) .
T cells represent an important component of the host immune response against human tumor cells .
The impairment of T cell function and signaling pathways observed in cancer patients may hinder the development of T cell immunity and reduce the effectiveness of immunotherapy .
NF-4B is important to T cell activation and regulates the inducible expression of a large number of genes necessary for the development of T cell suppression by RCC-S may contribute to the immunosuppression of host Key Words : Transcription factors ; T-lymphocytes ; Kiahey neoplasms ; Proteins , NF- xB 299 Chonju 561-712 , Korea Tel : +82.652-250-1568 , Fax : +82.652-250-1564 E-mail : hjkim @ moak.chonbuk.ac.kr *This study was supported by a research grant from Chonbuk National University Hospital .
immunity .
The family of proteins is composed of p105/p50 p65 ( RelA ) , p100/p52 ( NF-kB2 ) , c-Rel and RelB which bind the 5B sequence motif in homo of heterodimeric form ( 6-10 ) .
NF-KB is present in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of T cells through interaction with inhibitory proteins , collectively termed IxkBs .
kBq inhibits both DNA binding activity and nuclear localization of RelA and c-Rel proteins ( 6 , 11 ) .
The principle steps in the activation of NF-kB involve the dissociation of dimeric forms containing RelA , c-Rel and from IxBa @ after phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I xBa @ ( 6 , 11 , 12 ) .
We determined the mechanism of NF-4B suppression in T cells of RCC patient and determined RCC-S induced suppression of NF-4B activation in normal T cells is similar to that observed in T cells of RCC patient .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and isolation of T cells Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with con 300 firmed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma and healthy volunteers .
Tumor tissue was obtained from RCC patients and used to make tumor supernatants .
Normal T cells were used as control and compared to patient T cells .
Normal T cells from healthy donors were used for culturing with tumor supernatants .
Peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) were isolated from healthy volunteers and RCC patients .
T cells were purified as previously described ( 13 , 14 ) : PBL were subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ , U.S.A. ) density gradient centrifu-gation and then depleted of macrophages , B cells and NK cells by negative selection using magnetic separation with microbeads coated with antibodies to CD14 , CD16 and CD19 ( Miltenyi Biotec Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA , U.S.A. ) .
To obtain activated T cells , T cells ( 5 X 10 `` /mLl ) were cultured in the absence and presence of stimulus for various lengths of times .
The medium used was RPMI1640 supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum .
PMA ( 20 ng/mL ) ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO , U.S.A. ) plus ionomycin ( 0.75 ug/ml ) ( Sigma ) or cross-linked anti-CD3 ( 10 ug/ml ) ( Ortho Biotech , Rariton , NJ , U.S.A. ) plus IL-2 ( 1000 IU ) ( Hoffman LaRoche , Nutley , NJ , U.S.A. ) were used as stimulus .
Preparation of tumor supernatants To generate tumof supernatant fluid , tumot tissues from primary renal cell carcinoma were obtained from patients undergoing radical nephrectomy .
3 X3 mm explants were made from tumots using a No .
10 Bard-Parker scalpel and incubated overnight in RPMI1640 medium .
Thereafter , 1g of 3X3 mm explants were placed into a T-75 flask with 15 mL of Dulbecco 's Modified Eagles Medium without additional supple-ments .
After three days of culture at 37°C with 95 % air and 5 % CO ; the supernatant fluid was harvested , filtered and stored at -70 °C until use .
To determine the effect of tumor-detived soluble products on normal T cells , T cells were cultured in complete RPMI1640 with and without RCC-S .
The supernatant fluid was added to T cell cultures , using 20-50 % dilution .
Preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al .
( 15 ) with minor modifications .
T cells ( 10 X 10 % /mL ) were harvested and washed with cold PBS , and then sedimented by centrifugation .
The cell pellet was resuspended in 150 L of buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7.9 , 10 mM KCI , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 raM EGTA , 1 maM DTT , 100 ug/ml PMSF , 2 ug/ml aprotinin , 2 g/mL leupeptin , 100 pg/mL Pefabloc and 100 ug/ml chymostatin ) by gentle pipetting .

Kim were incubated on ice for 15 min and then 10 ul of 10 % Nonidet P-40 solution ( Sigma ) was added and centrifuged .
The supernatant fluid containing the cytoplasmic extracts was aliquoted .
Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 L of buffer C ( 25 % glycerol , 20 mM HEPES , pH 7.9 , 0.4 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 100 ug/ml PMSF , 2 ug/ml aprotinin , 2 g/mL leupeptin , 100 ug/ml Pefabloc and 100 ug/mal chymostatin ) .
After mixing at 4°C for 20 min and centrifuge , supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were taken and stored at -70°C .
Protein concentration was measured with a commercial kit ( Pierce BCA kit , Rockford , IL , U.S.A. ) .
Western blot analysis Protein samples ( 5-10 ug ) were mixed with equal volume of 2X Laemmli sample buffer , boiled and resolved by electrophoresis in 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gels .
The proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose membranes .
The membranes were blocked by incubating in 5 % nonfat dry milk in TBST overnight .
The membranes were sequentially incubated with specific antibody ( two hr for anti-lkBa @ and anti-c-Rel , one hr for anti-RelA and and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rab-bit IgG ( Amersham , Chicago , IL , U.S.A. ; 1:2000 dilution in TBST ) .
The membranes were washed with TBST and specific immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Dupont , Boston , MA , U.S.A. ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts obtained at various times after stimulation with either PMA plus ionomycin of cross-linked anti-CD3 plus IL-2 .
Nuclear extracts ( 5-10 ug ) were incubated in a 25 pL total reaction volume containing 20 mM HEPES , pH 7.9 , 80 mM NaCl , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 8 % glycerol and 2 uL of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ , U.S.A. ) for 15 min at 4°C .
The reaction mixture was then incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide ( 2 X 10° cpm ) for 20 min at room temperature .
The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 6 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.25X TBE buffer ( 22.3 mM Tris , 22.2 mM boric acid , 0.5 mM EDTA ) The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography .
An oligonucleotide corte-sponding to KB element from the IL-2R @ gene was prepared by using an Applied Biosystems oligonucleotide synthesizer ( model 381A ) .
The sequence of the oligonucleotide was : 5-CAACGGCAGGGGAATCTCCCTCTC-CTT-3 ' .
The underlined sequence represents the kB motif .

In normal T cells , stimulation with PMA/ionomycin resulted in the appearance of two distinct « B motif-specific DNA-binding activities ( designated C1 and C2 in Fig .
1 ) .
Both complexes were observed within 30 min of stimulation and remained elevated for at least two hr .
In six of patient-derived T cells ( n=10 ) , the C1 complex was not detectable .
In T cells obtained from the other four patients , the C1 activity was observed after 30 min of stimulation but returned to basal levels in two hr ( Fig .
1 ) ( Table 1 ) .
Nuclear extracts from patient T cells showed consti-tutive expression of the C2 complex and the abundance of this activity was increased by stimulation .

Expression of and 1xBa in T cells from RCC patients The nuclear localization of RelA , c-Rel and NF-4B1 in the different cell populations was examined by Western analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts at various times following stimulation .
In normal T cells , expression of c-Rel , RelA and was increased in the nucleus after 30 min and two hr of stimulation .
There were decreased expression of RelA and c-Rel in the nuclei of patient T cells suggesting impaired translocation ( Fig .
2 ) .
Alterations in levels of nuclear RelA were the most dramatic .
In four of 10 RCC patient T cells modest but significant levels of RelA were detected within the nucleus after 30 min of stimulation but faded into the background in two hr ( Fig .
2A ) .
In six other samples nuclear RelA was undetectable at any time ( Fig .
2B ) ( Table 1 ) .
Levels of NF- « kB1 and c-Rel in the nucleus were increased modestly following stimulation .
Interest-ingly , no C1 activity was seen under these conditions .
T cells from normal donors and RCC patients were stimulated for various times with PMA/ionomycin to determine the change in IxBa @ , an inhibitor of NF-KB activity , by Western analysis .
A characteristic decrease in I1xBa expression was observed within 30 min in normal T cells ( Fig .
3 ) which coincides with the nuclear appearance of RelA ( Fig .
2 ) .
In patient-derived T cells ( n=10 ) , the magnitude and kinetics of IxBa @ degradation were similar to that of normal T cells ( Table 2 ) .

Effect of RCC-S in NF-zB activation Normal T cells were cultured in RCC-S overnight and then stimulated with PMA/ionomycin to determine whether RCC-S could alter activation of NF-KB in not-mal T cells NF- « B proteins remained in the cytoplasm but failed to undergo nuclear translocation after stimulation ( Fig .
4A ) .
kB-binding activity was also suppressed by RCC-S as determined by EMSA ( Fig .
4B ) ( Table 1 ) .
In most cases ( n=8 ) , RCC-S did not alter the normal degradation of IkBa @ .
In a few experiments ( n=2 ) , the degradation of IkBa @ was reduced by RCC-S ( Table 2 ) .
This frequency is similar to that observed in T cells from RCC patient ( n=10 ) .

Kim DISCUSSION The development of cellular immunity is dependent on the activation of T cells .
Activation-dependent stimulation of new gene transcription is now well documented , involving transacting factors such as NF- « B which regulates the expression of many genes important to T cell function and growth ( 6 , 16 , 17 ) .
T cells from cancer patients of tumor-bearing animals are impaired in theif response to extracellular stimuli including the activation of DNA-binding activity ( 14 , 18 ) .
Our results show that there are alterations in both the expression and DNA-binding activity of NF-4B family members of RCC patient T cells .
The major inducible < B-specific binding complex ( C1 ) either did not appear in the nucleus of was modestly activated and exhibited a markedly reduced time course .
The failure of c-Rel and RelA to accumulate normally in the nuclei of patient T cells was due to an event occurring after phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor 1xBq since this latter process occurred normally in RCC patient T cells .
Although the biological nature of the soluble products in tumor supernatants is not known , the culture supernatant of tumor cells may produce a variety of immuno-suppressive molecules such as IL-10 , TGF- and prosta-glandin E2 ( 5 ) .
They may contribute to immune unresponsiveness of cancer patients and inhibit the activation of NF-kB .
Our results demonstrate that RCC-S can induce in normal T cells the same phenotype of impaired NF-KB activation that is detected in T cells of RCC patient .
These alterations in NF-4B activity may be due to a product ( s ) of renal tumor cells .
Stimulus-dependent degradation of IxBa in the cytoplasm was not impaired by RCC-S in most experiments .
However , the degradation of IkBa was reduced by RCC-S in two out of 10 cases .
Thus , there appears to be at least two different mechanisms by which RCC-S can suppress NF-4B acti-vation .
First , NF-KB proteins do not translocate to the nucleus at all .
Second , NF-4B proteins degrade in the nucleus after translocation .
In conclusion , two patterns of altered activation and alterations in NF- KB activity induced by RCC-§ may contribute to the lack of antitumor immunity in RCC patients .
