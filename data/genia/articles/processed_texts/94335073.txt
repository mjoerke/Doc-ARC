9 Upregulation of be/-2 by the Epstein-Barr Virus Latent Membrane Protein LMP1 : a B-Cell-Specific Response That Is Delayed Relative to NF-kB Activation and to Induction of Cell Surface Markers MARTIN ROWE , '* MARC PENG-PILON , * DAVID S. HUEN , ' ROBERT HARDY , DEBORAH CROOM-CARTER , ' ERIK LUNDGREN , `` anp ALAN B. RICKINSON® ' Institute of Cancer Studies , University of Birmingham Medical School , Birmingham B15 2TJ , United Kingdom , `` and Department of Cell and Molecular Biology , University of Umea , Umea 901 87 , Sweden Received 31 March 1994/Accepted 6 June 1994 An ability of the Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein LMPI to enhance the survival of infected B cells through upregulation of the be/-2 oncogene was first suggested by experiments involving gene transfection and the selection of stable LMP1* clones ( S. Henderson , M. Rowe , C. Gregory , F. Wang , E. Kieff , and A. Rickinson , Cell 65:1107-1115 , 1991 ) .
However , it was not possible to ascertain whether Bcel-2 upregulation was a specific consequence of LMP1 expression or an artifact of the selection procedure whereby rare Bcl-2* cells already present in the starting population might best be able to tolerate the potentially toxic effects of LMP1 .
We therefore reexamined this issue by using two different experimental approaches that allowed LMPI-induced effects to be monitored immediately following expression of the viral protein and in the absence of selective pressures ; activation of the NF-xB transcription factor and upregulation of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 were used as early indices of LMPI1 function .
In the first approach , stable clones of two B-cell lines carrying an LMPI gene under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter were induced to express LMP1 in all cells .
Activation of NF-B and upregulation of ICAM-1 occurred within 24 h and were followed at 48 to 72 h by upregulation of Bel-2 .
In the second approach , we tested the generality of this phenomenon by transiently expressing LMP1 from a strong constitutively active promoter in a range of different cell types .
All six B-cell lines tested showed NF-B activation in response to LMP1 expression , and this was followed in five of six lines by expression of ICAM-1 and Bcl-2 .
In the same experiments , all three non-B-cell lines showed NF-B activation and ICAM-1 upregulation but never any effect upon Bcl-2 .
We therefore conclude that Bel-2 upregulation is part of the panoply of cellular changes induced by LMP1 but that the effect is cell type specific .
Our data also suggest that whilst may be an essential component of LMP1 signal transduction , other cell-specific factors may be required to effect some functions of the viral protein .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus in humans that is usually apathogenic but which is also associated with a number of malignant diseases , including Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , and Hodgkin 's disease ( 37 , 57 ) .
In healthy infected individuals , the virus persists for life , probably as a latent infection in the B-lymphoid compartment ( 14 , 56 ) .
Infection of normal B lymphocytes with EBV in vitro results in growth transformation and the establishment of lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) with infinite proliferative potential .
This growth transformation is associated with the expression of six nuclear antigens ( EBNAs ) , three latent membrane proteins ( LMPs ) , and two small nonpolyadenylated RNAs ( EBERs ) that are constitutively expressed from the viral genome in LCLs ( 25 ) .
Experiments with recombinant viruses have demonstrated EBNA2 , EBNA3A , EBNA3C , and LMP1 to be essential for the growth transformation and immortalization of B lymphocytes ( 6 , 19 , 24 , 51 ) .
Although successful transformation of B lymphocytes by EBV requires the coordinate expression of several of the EBV latent genes , many of the transformation-associated properties of EBV can be reproduced in various cell systems by expression of just one viral gene which encodes a 386-amino-acid integral membrane protein , LMP1 .

5602 dicted to have a short hydrophilic amino-terminal region and a long hydrophilic carboxy-terminal region , both localizing to the cytosolic side of the membrane , and six membrane-spanning hydrophobic domains ( 12 , 28 , 32 ) .
The biochemical properties of LMP I1 are consistent with it being a growth factor receptor ( 33 , 34 ) , although as yet there is no evidence that its action is dependent upon the presence of any ligand .
LMPI1 has the properties of a classical oncogene since transfection of this viral gene into immortalized , but nontu-morigenic , rodent fibroblasts induces a fully transformed phenotype which enables the cells to grow as tumors in vivo ( 4 , 53 ) .
Expression of LMPI1 in human epithelial cells , a natural host cell type for EBV , results in morphological transformation and inhibition of normal cell differentiation ( 8 , 11 ) .
Transfection of the LMP !
gene into human B lymphocytes induces many phenotypic changes characteristic of activated lymphocytes , including induction of DNA synthesis ; increased cell size ; upregulation of various cell surface activation markers and adhesion molecules , e.g .
, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) and leukocyte function antigen 3 ( LFA-3 ) ; and induction of homotypic cell adhesion ( 39 , 54 , 55 ) .
While most studies of EBV-induced transformation of human B lymphocytes have focused on the induction of an activated cell phenotype and cell proliferation , there is another property of EBV that is important in this respect .
Thus , expression of the full complement of latent viral genes in EBV-infected B cells protects the cells from death by programmed cell death , or apoptosis .
This survival advantage VoL .
68 , 1994 appears to be mediated at least in part by the be/-2 cellular oncogene , which encodes a transmembrane protein , Bcl-2 , that inhibits apoptosis ( 15 , 38 ) .
Experiments with stable gene-transfected B-lymphoma lines suggested that induction of Bcel-2 forms part of the wide panoply of cellular changes directly induced by LMP1 ( 13 , 20 ) .
However , it was not possible to exclude an alternative explanation ; that the observed coincidence of LMP1 and Bcl-2 expression was an artifact of the clonal selection procedure .
Thus , since LMP1 appears to be toxic when overexpressed in certain cells , it can be argued that any rare Bcl-2* cells within the starting population would be best equipped to tolerate expression of the introduced gene and to give rise to a stable and Bcel-2* clone ( 35 ) .
In support of this argument , Martin et al .
( 35 ) noted that in their hands LMP1 expression did not cause Bci-2 upregulation in one of two B-cell lines tested or in a rodent fibroblast line in which other growth-transforming properties of the viral protein were well documented .
The need to resolve these issues concerning the nature of the LMP1-Bcl-2 connection in B cells and its relevance to other cell types was the impetus for the present work .
Two experimental approaches were adopted , both allowing the effects of LMP1 to be monitored in cells immediately following expression of the viral protein and in the absence of selective pressures .
First , we generated new stable clones of BL lines carrying an inducible LMP1 gene , which allowed induction of LMP1 at will in the total cell population within hours .
Second , we analyzed the expression of Bcl-2 at the single-cell level in a range of B-cell and non-B-cell lines in which transient LMP1 expression was obtained following electroporation of the LMP1 gene under the control of a constitutively active promoter .
The data obtained reconcile the results of Martin et al .
( 35 ) with our own previous observations ( 20 ) and show that the ability of LMP1 to upregulate Bcl-2 is determined by the target cell type .
A role for LMP1 in the induction of Bcel-2 emphasizes the multiplicity of phenotypic effects mediated by this viral protein and suggests that LMP1-activated intracellular signalling pathways may be complex .
In this context , it is of interest that LMP1 was shown recently to induce the A20 zinc finger protein , which affords protection against the cytotoxic action of tumor necrosis factor alpha , through activation of the transcription factor NF- « B ( 26 ) .
This transcription factor was also previously implicated in the LMP1-mediated transactivation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat ( 18 ) .
These reports prompted us to investigate whether LMP1 caused activation of NF- « B in different cell backgrounds and whether activation of NF- « B correlated with induced expression of ICAM-1 or Bcl-2 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
DG75 , BL41 , and BJAB are EBV-negative tumor lines from BL patients ( 47 ) .
RAEL , ELI-BL , and AKATA are tumor cell lines from EBV-positive BL patients , and they show a Latency I form of infection in which EBNA1 and the EBERs are the only viral genes expressed ( 36 , 46 , 48 ) .
Jurkat and HPB-ALL are both T-cell lines from acute lymphocytic leukemia patients ( 5 ) , and K562 is a proerythromyelocytic cell line ( 31 ) .
All lines were maintained as suspension cultures in growth medium , consisting of bicarbonate-buffered RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and gentamicin antibiotic , at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % carbon dioxide .
MAbs .
Routine detection of LMP1 in immunofluorescence and Western immunoblotting was performed with the CS.1-4 INDUCTION OF Bcl-2 BY LMP1 5603 murine immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) previously described ( 45 ) .
In certain dual-staining immunofluorescence experiments , an anti-LMP1 MAb , LMPO25 , of the IgG2a subclass was used ; this antibody was produced from a hybridoma generated by fusion of the Sp2/0-Ag14 myeloma with spleen cells immunized with a membrane fraction of Sf9 cells infected with an LMPl-expressing recombinant baculovirus ( 44a ) .
Bel-2 protein was detected in Western blot and in immunofluorescence procedures with a murine MAb , bel-2/124 ( 42 ) , purchased from DAKO .
The murine MAbs TS2/9 ( 49 ) and RR/1 ( 44 ) were employed in indirect immunofluorescence assays to detect the intercellular adhesion molecules LFA-3 and ICAM-1 , respectively .
A fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated MAb to ICAM-1 ( Immunotech ) was used in certain immunofluorescence experiments in which dual staining of ICAM-1 and LMP1 was required .
Plasmids .
Two types of LMP1 expression vectors were used , one containing a drug resistance marker for selection of stable transfectants and an inducible human metallothionein type 2 gene promoter ( pSV2.gpt.MTLM ) and a second containing a constitutively active cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter driving the LMP1 gene ( pCMVLMP1 ) .
The construction of the plasmid pSV2.gpt.MTLM and the pSV2.gpt control vector have previously been described ( 53 ) , as have the pCMVLMP1 plasmid and its vector control construct , pCMVLMPA ( 39 ) .
The « kB.CONA.LUC reporter plasmid ( 3 ) contains three NF- « B enhancer elements upstream of a conalbumin promoter driving a luciferase gene .
The pCMV.LTR.GH plasmid was constructed by J .
Sample ( Department of Virology and Molecular Biology , St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital , Memphis , Tenn. ) and contains the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 long terminal repeat coupled to the CMV IE promoter in front of the human growth hormone gene .
Electroporation .
Transfection of DNA into cell lines was performed by electroporating 10 `` cells in 500 pl of growth medium in 4-mm-gap cuvettes with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser .
The cells were gently mixed with 10 pg of DNA and allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 min before electroporation at 960 wF and at predetermined optimum voltages for each cell line ( 380 V for K562 ; 340 V for HPB-ALL ; 320 V for BJAB and BL41 ; 310 V for Jurkat ; 300V for DG75 , ELI-BL , and AKATA ; 260V for RAEL ) .
After electroporation , cells were allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature before transfer to prewarmed growth medium .
Production of stable transfectants with inducible LMPI expression .
The BL41 series of stable transfectants ( BL41-gpt and BL41-MTLM ) were generated previously with the pSV2.gpt and pSV2.gpt.MTLM plasmids and have been described elsewhere ( 55 ) .
The ELI-BL series of stable transfectants ( ELI-gpt and ELI-MTLM ) were generated in the present study with the same vectors and were obtained by electroporating 10 `` ELI-BL cells , which were then incubated overnight as a bulk culture in 10 ml of growth medium before addition of mycophenolic acid ( 0.2 pg/ml ) , xanthine ( 160 pg/ml ) , and hypoxanthine ( 10 pg/ml ) and seeding into 188 culture wells of two 96-microwell tissue culture plates .
Drug-resistant colonies were screened for LMP1 expression by Western blot at 10 to 20 days after transfection .
Lines which showed efficient induction of LMP1 expression by heavy metals were identified by being cultured in the presence of 6 M cadmium chloride or 75 wM zinc chloride for 24 h. Subsequent induction experiments were carried out with 6 uM cadmium chloride since this showed limited toxicity compared with zinc chloride in longer-term cultures .
Electroporation and transient expression of transfected genes .
pCMVLMP1 or the vector control plasmid , pCMV- 5604 ROWE ET AL .
LMPA , was electroporated into various cell lines at the optimum voltages for each line ( see above ) .
The transfected cells were transferred to 10 ml of prewarmed growth medium and cultured for 1 to 3 days at 37°C for analysis of LMPI gene expression and cellular phenotype .
The number of viable cells at 24 h postelectroporation was typically about 2 x 10° to 4 x 10° cells , with some lines ( e.g .
, DG75 , HPB-ALL , and K562 ) consistently showing greater tolerance of the electroporation than other lines .
Samples of electroporated cells that were to be analyzed by immunofluorescence were first depleted of dead cells and debris by centrifugation over a discontinuous gradient of Lymphoprep ( Nycomed AS , Oslo , Norway ) .
Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of cell surface phenotype .
Cells were harvested , washed once in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 10 % normal goat serum ( PBS-ngs ) , and divided into aliquots of 5 X 10° cells to be incubated for 30 min at 0°C with 50 pl of MAb diluted to 10 pg/ml in PBS-ngs .
Following two washes with PBS , the cells were incubated for 30 min at 0°C with 50 wl of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG { ( FO257 ; Sigma ) diluted 1:50 in PBS-ngs plus 10 % normal human serum ( PBS-ngs-nhs ) .
The cells were then washed twice in PBS and fixed at 4°C in 1 ml of 1 % paraformaldehyde in PBS .
Fluorescence staining of cell surface markers was analyzed by flow cytometry with a Becton-Dickinson Flow 440 set to measure FITC emission on a linear immunofluorescence intensity scale .
Western blotting for LMPI and Bcl-2 expression .
Cells were solubilized and separated by Laemmli discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) before being clectroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters for probing with CS.1-4 ( anti-LMP1 ) or bel-2/124 ( anti-Bel-2 ) MAb and detection with '*°I-protein A , as described previously ( 20 ) .
Immunofluorescence on fixed-cell smears .
At 18 , 48 , or 72 h after transfection , the viable cells were recovered by centrifugation over a Lymphoprep gradient , washed in PBS , and resuspended at 10° cells per ml in PBS .
This suspension was used to prepare cell smears on microscope slides which were air dried and then fixed in acetone-methanol ( 1:1 ) at -20°C for 5 min .
The smears were rehydrated in PBS-ngs-nhs ) .
For the detection of LMP1 and Bel-2 , the smears were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with MAbs to LMP I ( CS.1-4 ) or to Bel-2 ( bel-2/124 ) , diluted 1:5 in PBS-ngs-nhs .
After three washes of 5 min each in PBS , the smears were reacted for 1 h with FITC-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse IgG1 ( Southern Biotechnology As-sociates ) diluted in PBS-ngs-nhs .
Detection of ICAM-1 was achieved by incubating the rehydrated smears for 1 h with FITC-conjugated MAb to ICAM-1 ( Immunotech ) diluted 1:25 in PBS-ngs-nhs .
Following FITC labelling of LMP1 , Bel-2 , or ICAM-1 as described above , the smears were washed once in PBS , then incubated with propidium iodide ( 10 pg/ml ) to counterstain the nuclei , and washed a further three times in PBS before being mounted in DABCO ( 1,4-diazobicyclo- [ 2,2,2 ] -octane ) antifading mountant ( 23 ) for analysis by confocal microscopy .
Dual staining for ICAM- !
and LMPI was performed by first staining the smears with FITC-anti-ICAM-1 as described above and then incubating them with LMPO25 ( an 1gG2a subclass anti-LMP1 ) , followed by a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a reagent ( Southern Biotechnology Associates ) .
Dual staining for Bel-2 and LMP1 was performed by first staining the smears with bel-2/124 followed by FITC-anti-mouse IgGl as described above and then staining for LMP I with LMPO25 followed by a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a .
Confocal microscopy was performed with a Molecular Dynamics system ; the micrographs illustrated in Fig .
4 and 5 are look-through projections of 30 to 40 scanned J. ViroL .
sections with voxel sizes of 0.07 pum ( width ) by 0.07 wm ( length ) by 0.3 um ( depth ) and with amplifiers set to exploit and be within the dynamic range of the detectors .
Assay for activation by LMPI .
Cell lines were cotransfected with 5 ug each of the plasmids « B.CONA.LUC and pCMV.LTR.GH and cither pCMVLMPI or the pCMVLMPA control plasmid .
The electroporated cells were transferred to 6 ml of growth medium , and replicate 1-ml cultures were set up .
At 24 h postelectroporation , the cells were harvested and the NF- « B activity was determined by quantita-tion of luciferase activity in a bioluminescence assay .
To control for variation in transfection efficiency between different samples , the culture supernatants were also harvested and the amount of secreted human growth hormone ( hGH ) ( expressed from the cotransfected pCMV.LTR.GH ) was measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
The relative NF-KB activity for each transfected sample was calculated by dividing the luciferase activity by the amount of hGH secreted .
Bioluminescence assay for luciferase activity .
The assay used was a modification of the technique of de Wet et al .
( 10 ) .
Transfectants were washed twice in PBS and then lysed in 400 to 500 pl of assay buffer ( 100 mM sodium phosphate [ pH 8.0 ] , 5 mM magnesium chloride , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 % Triton X-100 ) .
Cellular debris was removed by a brief centrifugation , and then 300 pl of the lysate was transferred to a scintillation tube containing 30 pl of 25 mM ATP and analyzed in a Berthold LB 9501 luminometer .
Light release was integrated for 10 s commencing 5 s after the injection of 100 pl of 0.5 mM luciferin dissolved in 30 mM glycylglycine buffer , pH 8.0 .
ELISA for hGH .
Wells of Immulon-1 micro-ELISA plates ( Dynatech ) were coated with a murine MAb to hGH ( 2FI0 ; Biogenesis , 4750-0316 ) by incubating them with 5 ug of MAb per ml in 0.1 M bicarbonate buffer ( pH 9.5 ) at 4°C overnight .
The plates were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1 % Tween-20 and were blocked at 37°C for 1 h with 1 % bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween .
Plates were then given a further three washes in PBS-Tween before incubation with 50 pul of the test samples for 2 h at room temperature .
Culture supernatants from the hGH-transfected cells were tested in duplicate , both undiluted and diluted 1:10 in PBS .
The plates were washed three times in PBS-Tween and then incubated for 1.5 h with a 1/2,000 dilution of sheep anti-hGH antibodies ( Biogenesis , 4750-0254 ) .
After three further washes with PBS-Tween , the plates were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antibodies to sheep IgG ( Sigma , A3415 ) diluted 1/4,000 .
Following five washes with PBS-Tween , the plates were developed with 1,2-phenylenediamine ( DAKO , $ -2000 ) in 0.1 M citric acid-phosphate buffer for 5 min before the reaction was terminated with H , SO , and optical densities were measured at 490 nm .
The concentration of hGH in the test samples was calculated from a standard curve constructed from the results obtained with duplicate doubling dilutions of a 100-ng/ml hGH standard .
The useful range of this ELISA was 2 to 40 ng of hGH per ml .
RESULTS LMP1 induction in stable clones causes upregulation of adhesion molecules and Bel-2 .
In the first set of experiments , ELI-BL was transfected with pSV2.gpt.MTLM , which is a drug-selectable DNA vector containing the LMPI gene under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter .
The transfected cells were selected with mycophenolic acid , and stable drug-resistant clones were expanded and analyzed for Vor .

Kinetics of LFA-3 ( A ) and ICAM-1 ( B ) expression following cadmium-induced expression of LMP I in stably transfected clones of ELI-BL .
Two transfected clones carrying the metallothionein-driven LMP 1 gene ( MTLM.1 and MTLM.2 ) were compared with the parental ELI-BL line ( parent ) and with a clone transfected with the LMP !
-negative control vector DNA ( gpt.1 ) .
Cells were treated with 6 uM cadmium chloride , and replicate cultures were harvested at the time points shown for immunofluorescence staining with the MAbs TS/2.9 ( anti-LFA-3 ) and ( anti-ICAM-1 ) followed by flow cytometric analysis .
Immunofluorescence intensity was analyzed on a linear scale , and the mean fluorescence intensity ( arbitary units ) was determined .
The mean fluorescence intensity of a normal EBV-transformed LCL was analyzed for comparison , and the results are indicated with a solid triangle .
inducible LMPI1 expression .
The selected stable clones expressed different basal levels of LMP1 from the metallothionein promoter , but some clones were found to have low basal expression and to be particularly responsive to induction by the heavy metals .
Titration experiments showed that 6 M cadmium chloride regularly gave maximal induction of LMPI within 5 to 9 h in all inducible clones .
Most importantly , this concentration of cadmium was usually nontoxic , as judged by cell viability and proliferation , when added to control cultures for a period of up to 3 days .
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the effect of 6 wM cadmium chloride upon the cellular phenotype of two transfectants of the ELI-BL line ( ELI-MTLM.1 and ELI-MTLM.2 ) compared with the parental ELI-BL line and with a drug-resistant vector control transfectant ( ELI-gpt.1 ) .

Western blots illustrating the kinetics of LMP1 and Bcl-2 expression following cadmium induction in ELI-BL lines stably transfected with the metallothionein-driven LMP1 gene .
The gpt.1 control transfectant and the MTLM.1 and MTLM.2 LMP1 gene transfectants were treated with 6 uM cadmium and harvested at 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 days as for Fig .
1 .
Cells were solubilized and separated by Laemmli SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose , and replicate blots were probed with MAb CS.1-4 ( anti-LMP1 , top panel ) or bel-2/124 ( anti-Bcl-2 , bottom panel ) .
compared with the control clones , the MTLM clones showed significantly higher expression of the adhesion molecules LFA-3 and ICAM-1 even before treatment with cadmium ( Fig .
1 ) ; this is consistent with the basal expression of LMPI detected in these clones when analyzed by Western blotting ( Fig .
2 ) .
Treatment of the MTLM clones with cadmium led to induction of the adhesion molecules LFA-3 ( Fig .
1A ) and ICAM-1 ( Fig .
1B ) within 24 h , with a maximum induction being achieved by 48 h. Cadmium caused no such phenotypic effect in the control gpt.1 clone or in the parental ELI-BL line .
The Western blots shown in Fig .
2 ( upper panel ) illustrate that maximum induction of LMPI1 by cadmium in this system was achieved within 24 h and that the induced levels were comparable to , or in excess of , the levels of LMPI in normal EBV LCLs .
Parallel blots ( Fig .
2 , lower panel ) probed with anti-Bcl-2 antibodies demonstrated a temporal increase in Bcl-2 expression in the cadmium-treated MTLM transfectants and no change in the cadmium-treated control gpt transfectant .
Cadmium-induced expression of LMP 1 in the MTLM transfectants did not have any effect upon cell viability during the time span of these experiments , and immunofiuo-rescence staining of fixed-cell smears showed that induction of both LMP1 and Bel-2 expression occurs uniformly in all cells within the cadmium-treated cultures ( data not shown ) .
Similar data were obtained with a series of stable clones of BL41 transfected with the inducible MTLM expression vector .
Adhesion molecules were induced with kinetics similar to those observed with the ELI-MTLM clones ( data not shown ) , and the induction of Bcl-2 expression again lagged behind that of LMP1 and ICAM-1 .
As illustrated by two representative clones in Fig .
3 , maximal Bel-2 expression was not achieved until 2 to 3 days after addition of cadmium .
Throughout these experiments , upregulation of Bel-2 by LMPI was consistently observed , but there was no obvious correlation between LMP 1 levels and the levels or kinetics of Bel-2 induction .

The gpt.1 control transfectant and the MTLM.4 and MTLM.11 LMP1 gene transfectants were treated with 6 M cadmium and analyzed as for Fig .
2. example , lower levels of LMP1 were induced in the BL41-MTLM.4 clone compared with the BL41.MTLM.11 clone , but the levels of Bcl-2 induced in the MTLM.4 clone were consistently higher than those in the MTLM.11 clone .
Furthermore , maximum induction of Bel-2 was achieved by 48 h in the MTLM.4 clone , compared with 72 h in the MTLM.11 clone ( Fig .
3 ) .
LMP1 induction in stable clones causes activation of NF-B .
Since other workers have shown that LMP1 mediates at least some of its effects through activation of NF- « B ( 18 , 26 ) , we asked whether NF-kB activation occurred in the stable MTLM clones following induction of LMP1 by cadmium .
NF- « B activity was assayed with the kB.CONA.LUC reporter DNA construct in which the luciferase reporter gene expression is under the control of a conalbumin promoter regulated by three repeated NF- « B binding motifs .
The ELI-MTLM.2 and BL41-MTLM.4 lines were transfected with the reporter DNA , and replicate cultures were then set up with and without 6 M cadmium chloride .
At 16 h after electroporation , the induction of LMP1 activity ( Fig .
4A ) was shown to be paralleled by induced synthesis of luciferase ( Fig .
4B ) .
No induction of luciferase synthesis was observed in control ELI-gpt and BL41-gpt lines transfected with the reporter and treated with cadmium ( Fig .
4 ) .
The specificity of this reporter assay for NF- « B activation was confirmed in control experiments which showed that there was no LMP1-induced expression of luciferase from the CONA.LUC control plasmid which lacked the kB binding sites ( data not shown ) .
These experiments therefore showed that activation of NF- « B was an early consequence of induced LMP1 expression in B lymphocytes .
Transient expression of LMP1 induces Bcl-2 in transfected B-cell lines .
In the second set of experiments , the ability of transient LMP1 expression to induce Bel-2 was investigated in several different cell lines following electroporation with the pCMVLMP1 plasmid .
Expression of LMP1 from pCMVLMP1 is driven by the strong constitutive CMV promoter , and previous transient expression studies using this plasmid have demonstrated that expression of the LMP1 gene results in upregulation of cell surface ICAM-1 within 24 h ( 40 ) .

Induction of NF- « B activity by LMP1 in BL lines stably transfected with an inducible LMP1 gene .
Control and LMP1 gene-transfected lines of ELI-BL ( gpt.1 and MTLM.2 [ Fig .
2 ] ) and BL41 ( gpt.1 and MTLM.4 [ Fig .
3 ] ) were transfected with the NF-kB luciferase reporter DNA , and then replicate cultures were treated with or without 6 wM cadmium chloride .
After 16 h , the cells were harvested and analyzed for LMP1 expression by Western blotting with the CS.1-4 MAb ( A ) and for NF-kB activity by measuring luciferase activity ( B ) .
earlier study employed flow-cytometric analysis of immunofiu-orescence staining on viable cells to analyze induction of cell surface markers in cell lines which showed efficient transfection efficiency .
The present experiments employed immunofluorescence staining of fixed-cell smears , followed by confocal microscopy ; this is a more sensitive assay for monitoring intracellular markers such as LMP1 and Bcl-2 and suitable even for target lines which transfect with relatively poor efficiency .
Figure 5 illustrates representative results obtained following transfection of two BL lines , DG75 and BJAB , and the proerythromyelocytic cell line K562 .
At 72 h after transfection , cell smears were fixed and stained for LMP1 , ICAM-1 , and Bcl-2 with FITC-conjugated antibodies ( green , or yellow with intense staining ) , and the nuclei were counterstained red with propidium iodide .
DG75 cells transfected with control vector ( top row , Fig .

In contrast , DG75 cells transfected with pCMVLMP1 ( second row , Fig .

Cell lines ( DG75 , BJAB , and K562 ) were transfected with vector control DNA ( top row ) or with DNA containing a CMV promoter-driven LMP1 gene ( rows 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , and after 72 h , cells were harvested for preparation of smears on slides .
The slides were fixed in acetone-methanol and then stained with the MAbs CS.1-4 ( anti-LMP1 , column 1 ) , RR/1 ( anti-ICAM-1 , column 2 ) , and bel-2/124 ( anti-Bcl-2 , column 3 ) followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG second-step reagent .
Before being analyzed on the confocal microscope , the nuclei were counterstained red with propidium iodide .

The BJAB cell line ( third row , Fig .

However , whilst the expression of LMPL in the K562 line ( bottom row , Fig .

Two-color staining for ICAM-1 and LMP1 ( Fig .

6A , bottom panel ) in DG75 cells at 72 h after electroporation with pCMVLMPI confirmed that both of these cellular markers were induced in the LMP1-positive subpopulation of cells .
In these experiments , LMP1 was stained red with Texas Red-conjugated antibodies whilst ICAM-1 and Bcl-2 were stained green with FITC-conjugated antibodies ; areas of colocalized staining appear yellow .
The level of LMP1 expression among the transfected cell population varied enormously ; a spectrum of staining intensity was observed from very weakly stained cells through cells that appeared completely saturated with LMP1I .

Importantly , induction of Bel-2 by LMP1 was observed in five of five B-cell lines in which ICAM-1 was also upregulated .
In contrast , Bel-2 was not induced in any of three non-B-cell lines studied , even though ICAM-1 was clearly upregulated by LMP1 in each case .
The AKATA BL line was unusual in that it was the only B-cell line studied in which LMP1 did not effect upregulation of ICAM-1 or Bcl-2 .
The cellular localization and levels of LMP1 expression in the transfected AKATA BL cells were indistinguishable from those observed in other transfected B-cell lines ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , a series of stable clones of LMPI1I-transfected AKATA cells was also found not to have induced ICAM-1 or Bcel-2 expression ( data not shown ) .
The data in Table 1 also show that the percentage of cells expressing Bci-2 in transfected B-cell lines was always lower than the percentage of cells expressing ICAM-1 at 72 h. The possibility that this may simply reflect different kinetics of induction for the two cellular proteins was suggested from the results of earlier experiments with cadmium-induced MTLM transfectants of ELI-BL and BL41 ( Fig .
1 and 2 ) .
This interpretation was tested by analyzing electroporated DG75 cells over a 3-day period .
Figure 7 shows that the percentage of LMP1-positive DG75 cells was in excess of 50 % at 18 h but dropped sharply to around 20 % by 48 h ; it was also observed that the intensity of LMP1 staining was reduced with time so that by 72 h most of the LMP1-positive cells showed staining comparable to that seen in normal EBV-transformed LCLs .
Whilst ICAM-1-positive cells were apparent at 18 h postelectroporation , the maximum percentage of positive cells was observed at around 48 h , and by 72 h the percentage of ICAM-1-positive cells had decreased .
In contrast , induction of Bcel-2-positive cells was not observed until 48 h postelectroporation , and the percentage of Bel-2-positive cells continued to rise between 48 and 72 h. Taken together , the data in Fig .
1 , 2 , 3 , and 7 suggest that the induction of Bcl-2 expression by LMP1 lags behind the induction of ICAM-1 by about 24 h. NF-KB is activated by LMP1 both in B-cell and in non-B-cell lines .
Having demonstrated that the kB.CONA.LUC reporter could be used to investigate LMP1-mediated activation of NF- « B ( Fig .

5. the wider panel of lines .
A plasmid containing the hGH gene expressed from a constitutively active strong promoter ( pCMV.LTR.GH ) was included in every cotransfection so that the hGH secreted into the culture supernatant could be assayed and used to monitor , and correct for , transfection efficiency .
Because the secreted hGH has to accumulate sufficiently before it can be detected by ELISA , the hGH and luciferase assays were both performed at 24 h posttransfection .
The NF- « B activities were determined as arbitary units of luciferase activity , corrected for transfection efficiency with the hGH data , and normalized to the luciferase activity of the transfected RAEL line which was included in every assay and was assigned an activity of 1 U .
First , in order to verify that NF- « B was activated by EBV , two phenotypically distinct subclones of the EBV-positive BL line MUTU ( 16 ) were transfected with the reporter plasmids .
The relative NF- « B activity of the group I subline ( expressing only EBNA1 ) was measured as 0.2 U whilst the relative NF- « B activity of the group III subline ( expressing LMP1 , LMP2 , and all six EB-NAs ) was measured as 3.3 U .
Table 2 shows the relative NF-kB activities of several cell lines into which the two reporter constructs were cotransfected INDUCTION OF Bel-2 BY LMPI 5609 either with pCMVLMP1 or with the corresponding control plasmid .
These data demonstrate that activation of NF-kB by LMP1 occurs in all cell types studied , including B cells , T cells , and proerythromyelocytic cells Of the B-cell lines , DG75 showed only poor induction of NF-kB activity following transient expression of LMP1 , but this cell line was unusual amongst the BL lines in having a high basal NF-kB activity , which was comparable to that observed in the group III subclone of MUTU-BL which expressed LMP1 along with all the other EBV latent genes ( see above ) .
This higher basal NF- « B activity in DG75 may be relevant in the context of the higher basal levels of ICAM-1 observed on DG75 cells compared with the other BL lines studied .
Finally , it was interesting to note that the AKATA BL line , which was unresponsive to LMP1 with respect to changes in cellular phenotype , did show a significant increase in NF- « B activity following expression of LMP1 .
DISCUSSION Our original suggestion that LMPI expression in B cells leads to upregulation of Bel-2 was based on results obtained with stable drug-selected clones of LMPI1 gene-transfected cells ( 20 ) .
Another possible interpretation of our results was recently proposed by Martin et al .
( 35 ) , who argued that , because LMP1 is toxic when overexpressed in certain cells , the only clones able to tolerate stable LMP 1 expression would be those which had been protected from LMPI1 toxicity by spontaneous upregulation of Bel-2 .
The results of our present study do not support this alternative interpretation but are instead consistent with our original conclusion that LMP1 specifically upregulates Bcl-2 in B lymphocytes .
Potential biases inherent in selecting stable LMP 1-express-ing clones were eliminated in our present study by analyzing expression of Bcl-2 during a 72-h period after expressing LMP1 .
In one experimental approach , Bel-2 was shown to be upregulated in two B-cell lines within 48 to 72 h of inducing LMP1 expression from a cadmium-inducible metallothionein promoter ( Fig .
2 and 3 ) .
This result was particularly informative because ( i ) there was no suggestion of any LMP 1-induced toxicity within the time course of the experiment , ( ii ) LMPI was induced in all cells of the cadmium-treated culture , and TABLE 2 .

( ifi ) immunofluorescence staining indicated that Bcl-2 upregulation occurred in the majority of cells and was not confined to a small subpopulation .
A second experimental approach , which entailed transient expression of a transfected LMP1 gene driven by a constitutively active promoter in a subpopulation of cells , likewise demonstrated upregulation of Bcel-2 in five B-cell lines which also responded to LMP1 by upregulating ICAM-1 expression ( Table 1 ) .
The kinetics of Bel-2 upregulation were similar in both sets of experiments and showed that upregulation of Bel-2 is a relatively late feature of the LMP1-induced phenotype , always lagging behind the upregulation of ICAM-1 and sometimes not detectable until 72 h. This observation offers an explanation as to why detection of Bcl-2 upregulation has previously been difficult in cells transiently transfected with the LMP1 gene .
Furthermore , we found that gross overexpres-sion of LMP1 was not conducive to upregulation of ICAM-1 or of Bel-2 ( indeed , these cells probably die ) .
Instead , upregulation of Bel-2 occurred in cells expressing levels of LMP1 more typical of that in LCLs ( Fig .
5 and 6 ) .
Consequently , in transient expression experiments in which the LMP1 gene is driven by the strong CMV promoter , not all the LMP1-positive cells show induction of Bel-2 or of ICAM-1 ( Fig .
7 and Table 1 ) .
Given the low transfection efficiency of some cell lines , this means that Bcl-2 upregulation may occur in fewer than 1 % of the total viable cell population ; detection of this effect requires an analytical procedure with appropriate sensitivity , such as immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy .
The data obtained in the present study suggest that the ability of LMP1 to upregulate Bel-2 may be restricted to target cells of the B-cell lineage .
Thus , upregulation of Bcl-2 was never observed in either of two T-lymphoblastoid lines or in the K562 proerythromyelocytic cell line following electroporation of the pCMVLMP1 plasmid and transient expression of LMP1 ( Tables 1 and 2 ) .
Other unpublished data from our laboratory show that LMP1 also does not upregulate Bel-2 in a human epithelial cell line ( 7a ) .
These data are consistent with the results of Martin et al .
( 35 ) , who showed that LMP 1 causes upregulation of Bcl-2 in the B-lymphoma line BJAB but is unable to induce Bcl-2 in BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts .
The apparent B-cell lineage-restricted upregulation of Bcl-2 by LMP1 contrasts with the upregulation of ICAM-1 which is observed both in B-cell lines and in a number of non-B-cell types , including T cells and proerythromyelocytes ( Table 1 ) , and in epithelial cells ( 8 ) .
It is worth noting that human T cells and epithelial cells can under certain circumstances express Bel-2 ( 1 , 2 , 22 ) and that the inability of LMP1 to upregulate the cellular oncogene in these cell types does not therefore reflect an inherent inability to express Bcl-2 .
Our conclusion from the above transfection experiments is that Bcl-2 upregulation does indeed represent one of a series of downstream events mediated by LMP1 expression in B cells .
Besides the importance of this to the overall biology of EBV infections in the B-lymphoid system , Bcl-2 upregulation also provides an in vitro readout of LMP1 function which , in terms both of cell lineage restriction and of kinetics , is distinct from the effect of LMP1 upon cell surface markers such as ICAM-1 and LFA-3 .
In the longer term , therefore , the Bcl-2 effect may prove important in elucidating the nature of LMP1 cell signalling pathways .
In this latter context , others have shown that one early effect of LMP1 expression is to activate NF-kB ( 18 , 26 ) , a transcription factor that is a pleiotropic mediator of inducible gene control ( 17 , 27 ) .
Inactive NF- « B heterodimers are stored in the cytoplasm , and activation involves release of these dimers from an inhibitory protein , IxB , which triggers translocation of active NF- « B dimers to the nucleus where they effect their J. ViroL .
function ( 43 ) .
Various members of the adhesion molecule family , including ICAM-1 ( 7 , 52 ) , have NF- « B-responsive elements proximal to their gene promoters .
This lends credibility to the hypothesis that LMP1 upregulates the adhesion molecules through activation of NF-kB .
We therefore investigated whether LMP1-mediated activation of NF-xB was cell type specific , possibly correlating with induction of Bel-2 , or whether activation of the transcription factor was observed in different cellular backgrounds and perhaps correlated with the induction of ICAM-1 .
The results ( Table 2 ) were consistent with the latter scenario .
It is important , however , to recognize that regulation of gene expression by NF- « B is complex .
At one level , this is due to the fact that there are at least five different proteins that can form dimers that bind DNA at NF- « B sites , and particular combinations of protein subunits determine the specificity of transcriptional activation ( 17 , 41 , 43 ) .
At another level , complexity is due to the requirement for accessory transcription factors that may regulate binding of NF-kB or synergize with NF-KB .
Thus , whilst activation of NF- « B may be an essential feature of LMP1 signalling , its activity may be regulated by other transacting factors and cis-elements ( 18 , 21 , 41 ) .
Two pieces of evidence from the present work suggest that this is indeed the case : ( i ) the AKATA BL line was unusual in that LMP1 did not upregulate expression of ICAM-1 or Bcl-2 ( Table 1 ) and yet LMP1 did activate NF-kB in this line ( Table 2 ) , and ( ii ) the DG75 BL line showed a high basal NF-kB activity that was comparable to that measured in a group III subclone of MUTU BL ( which expresses LMP1 , LMP2 , and all six EB-NAs ) , and whilst LMP1 induced a barely significant increase in NF- « B activity in this line , it clearly upregulated both ICAM-1 and Bcl-2 .
Whilst it is likely that LMP1 upregulates ICAM-1 via NF-xB , albeit in synergy with other inducible transcription factors , the contribution of NF-KB activation to Bel-2 upregulation can not be ascertained at present because the regulatory region of the bel-2 gene remains to be identified .
However , any effect of NF-kB upon Bcl-2 expression may well be indirect since LMP 1-mediated upregulation of Bel-2 always lags behind the upregulation of ICAM-1 ( Fig .
1 , 2 , and 7 ) .
Finally , it remains to be considered what is the biological significance of LMP1-mediated upregulation of Bcl-2 .
The transformation of rodent fibroblasts by LMP1 in vitro clearly does not require upregulation of Bcl-2 ( 35 ) .
Similarly , the phenotypic changes induced by LMP1 in human epithelial cells ( 8 , 11 ) also do not involve Bel-2 ( 7a ) .
We would postulate that in vivo the biological importance of LMP1-mediated upregulation of Bcl-2 lies in its ability to deliver a survival signal to target B cells and thus allow persistence of the virus in a long-lived B-cell compartment .
In normal lymphoid follicles , the resting lymphocytes are Bel-2 positive , but the proliferating Ki-67-positive germinal center B cells are Bcel-2 negative ( 42 ) .
If EBV were to infect Bcl-2-negative B cells , LMP1-mediated upregulation of Bel-2 would mimic the physiological process of antigen-driven selection of long-lived B cells in germinal centers ( 29 , 30 ) .
If EBV were to infect resting B cells , a role for LMP1 in regulating Bcl-2 is less obvious .
Indeed , because resting B cells already express a high level of Bel-2 , which is only slightly elevated following infection with EBV , it has been suggested that LMP1-mediated upregulation of Bcl-2 is of little relevance in these cells ( 35 ) .
However , this interpretation does not take into account the fact that mitogenic activation of lymphocytes in vitro results in decreased Bel-2 protein expression ( 1 , 2 , 50 ) .
Furthermore , human immunodeficiency virus-induced loss of the EBV genome in LCLs is associated with downregulation of Bel-2 and cell death ( 9 ) .
It therefore seems likely that EBV , through expression of LMP1 , specifically VoL .
68 , 1994 maintains high levels of Bel-2 in activated cells that would otherwise downregulate the cellular oncogene .
