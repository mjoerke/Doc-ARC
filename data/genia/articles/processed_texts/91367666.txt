HIV-TF1 had a molecular weight of 39,000 .
Binding of HIV-TF1 to the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) activated transcription from the HIV promoter in vitro .
The HIV-TF1-binding site in HIV LTR was similar to the site recognized by upstream stimulatory factor ( USF ) in the adenovirus major late promoter .
DNA-binding properties of HIV-TFA1 suggested that HIV-TF1 might be identical or related to USF .
Interestingly , treatment of purified HIV-TF1 by phosphatase greatly reduced its DNA-binding activity , suggesting that phosphorylation of HIV-TF1 was essential for DNA binding .
The disruption of HIV-TF1-binding site induced a 60 % decrease in the level of transcription from the HIV promoter in vivo .
These results suggest that HIV-TF1i is involved in transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 .
INTRODUCTION Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is a cytopathic retrovirus and is the etiologic agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) ( 1-4 ) .
Transcription of HIV is regulated by viral proteins such as Tat ( 5-7 ) and also by cellular transcription factors ( 8-11 ) .
Two regulatory regions in the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , the enhancer and TAR regions , are important for regulation by the enhancer-binding protein ( EBP ) and the viral trans-activator Tat .
The binding of regulatory protein ( s ) to the HIV enhancer is induced by compounds such as phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) or phorbol ester ( 11 , 12 ) .
This process is thought to be a key step for HIV production from latently infected T lymphocytes .
Multiple proteins were identified as the HIV EBP : NF-xB consisting of a 50 kDa and 65 kDa polypeptide ( 13 ) , 51-kDa NF-xB from Namalwa Burkit lymphoma cells ( 14 ) , 48-kDa KBF-1 from mouse BW5147 thymoma cells ( 15 ) , 36-42 kDa polypeptides from human BALL-1 B cells ( 16 ) , H2TF1 found in many types of cells ( 17 ) , 57-60 kDa EBP-1 from HeLa cells ( 18 ) , and 86-kDa HIVEN 86 found in activated human T-cells ( 19 ) .
NF-xB localized in the cytoplasm in sequestered form is dissociated from its inhibitor IxB by phosphorylation of IxB ( 20-22 ) .
Differences between H2TFI and NF-xB were noted in their contacts with DNA , their relative affinity with the related sequences , their inducibility , and cell type distribution ( 13 , 14 , 17 ) .
Recently , cDNA clones encoding two types of HIV EBP were isolated .
HIV-EP1/PRDII-BF1I/MBP-1 has a relative molecular mass of 298 kDa , and contains two zine fingers in the DNA-binding domain ( 23-25 ) .
The related proteins were also identified by cDNA cloning ( 26 , 27 ) .
The level of mRNAs encoding these proteins is induced by treatment of cells with mitogen and phorbol ester ( 25 , 27 ) .
On the other hand , cDNA cloning of the DNA-binding subumit ( p50 ) of NF-xB indicated that its DNA-biding domain had a homology with the rel oncoprotein and Drosophila dorsal gene product ( 28 , 29 ) .
Therefore , two different types of proteins , the metal-finger protein and the re/-related protein , can bind to the HIV-1 enhancer , but the mechanism of activation by mitogen and phorbol ester is different between these two types of proteins .
Another putative regulatory region ( nucleotides -159 to -173 ) upstream from the enhancer in the HIV-1 LTR was identified by DNase I footprinting with HeLa cell extracts ( 10 ) .
This region was also pointed out to contain a sequence similar to the site for upstream stimulatory factor ( USF ) in the adenovirus major late promoter ( Ad MLP ) ( 30 ) .
So far , however , little is known about the role of this site and the regulatory protein binding to this site .
Here , we report the purification and characterization of the transcription factor HIV-TF1 binding to this site .
HIV-TFI also bound to the USF site in Ad MLP .
Interestingly , phosphorylation of HIV-TFI1 was required for its DNA binding .

17 MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of HIV-TF1 HIV-TF1 was purified from whole cell extract ( WCE ) of human B cells , BALL-1 , using heparin-Sepharose and sequence-specific affinity column chromatography as described ( 16 ) .
A oligonucleotide column was prepared as described by Kadonaga and Tjian ( 31 ) with the synthetic duplex oligonucleotides shown in Fig .
1B .
DNA binding assay and photoaffinity labeling The gel retardation assay and DNase I footprinting were done as described ( 16 ) .
For the gel retardation assay , the synthetic duplex oligonucleotides shown in Fig .
1B were used as a probe .
For the DNase I footprinting , the Bg/Il-EcoRV fragment ( nucleotides +23 to -338 in the HIV-1 recombinant , pCD12 ( 32 ) ) was P-labeled at the 5 end of the upper strand .
Photoaffinity labeling was done by the method of Wu et al .
( 33 ) .
In vitro transcription Transcription using HeLa WCE was done as described ( 16 ) except for that 0.5 ug of HIV-1 template DNA and 0.5 ug of control template DNA were used .
The EcoRI-cut pCD12 plasmid DNA containing the HIV-1 promoter was used as a template .
The EcoRI-cut pRSVCAT plasmid DNA in which the Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) LTR promoter is linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene was used as the control template .
Run-off transcripts were analyzed on a 7 M urea/4 % polyacrylamide gel .
The amount of each transcript was measured by using a Bioimage Analyzer ( Fuji Photo Film Co. , Ltd. ) .
Mutant plasmid construction , DNA transfection , and CAT assay The HIV-TFl-binding site in the HIV LTR was disrupted as follows .
The HindIII fragment ( nucleotides +82 to -190 ) containing the HIV promoter was generated from the plasmid pCD12 by the method of polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , and then the HindIII fragment containing the whole region of the HIV LTR in pCD12 was replaced by this 272-bp HindIII fragment to generate the plasmid pCD-190 .
By using the primer corresponding to the mutant sequence of the HIV-TF1-binding site at nucleotide -166 , the mutant plasmid pCD-190TF 1m was constructed similarly .
For the CAT assay , the plasmid pCD-190 and the mutant plasmid pCD-190TF1m harboring the disrupted HIV-TFI-binding site were used .
Mixtures of each CAT plasmid DNA and 2 ug of pRSV-B-gal plasmid DNA were transfected into Jurkat T cells by electroporation ( 34 ) .
The plasmid pRSV-B-gal , which carries the E. coli B-galactosidase gene linked to the RSV LTR ( 35 ) was used as an internal control for differences in transfection efficiency between precipitates .
CAT assays were done by the method of Gorman et al .
( 36 ) .
The amounts of cell extract used for CAT assays were normalized with respect to B-galactosidase activity .
The degree of conversion was measured by the density of the spot corresponding to either unreacted | !
4C chloramphenicol or its accetylated forms using a Bioimage analyzer ( Fuji Photo Film Co. , Ltd. ) .
Phosphatase treatment Purified HIV-TFI or HIV EBP was treated with potato acid phosphatase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Purified protein ( 2 ng ) was incubated with 8x 10-5 units of phosphatase in 15 pl of gel retardation-binding buffer [ 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 50 mM KCI .
1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.05 % Nonidet P-40 , 100 ug/ml bovine serum albumin , 5 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol ] for 20 min at 30°C .
The P-labeled probe was then added and incubated for 30 min at 25°C , and the material was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in low ionic strength .

used as a probe .
The binding activity was detected in fractions corresponding to 0.4-0.5 M KCl ( data not shown ) .
This fraction was then put on an oligo-DNA Sepharose column , in which the same duplex oligonucleotides as those used in the gel retardation assay were used as a ligand , and the binding factor was eluted by increases in the KCl concentration .
The binding factor was detected in fractions 10-18 corresponding to 0.5-0.6 M KCI , which included 39 and 40 kDa polypeptides as the major protein and other minor polypeptides of 70-80 kDa ( Fig .
1A and B ) .
The bands between 65 and 50 kDa corresponded to a silver staining artifact .
About 10 ug of polypeptides of 39 and 40 kDa ( HIV-TF1 ) was purified from 100 g of BALL-1 cells .
To examine which polypeptide binds specifically to the sequence shown in Fig .
1B , we used UV cross-linking .
The photoaffinity labeling probe was prepared from the oligonucleotide shown in Fig .
1B .
After incubating the DNA probe with the purified factor , the mixture was exposed to UV light , digested with nuclease , and analyzed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
We observed the protein-DNA adduct of about 45 kDa as a major band that was resistant to further increases in DNase digestion ( Fig .
1C , lane 2 ) .
In a competition experiment an unlabeled specific oligonucleotide abolished the signal ( lane 3 ) .
Omission of purified facror from the reaction also failed to produce any signal ( lane 1 ) .
These results indicated that two polypeptides of 39 and/or 40 kDa had a binding activity .

Two nucleotides of the HIV-TF1-binding site in pCD-190 were changed to generate the plasmid pCD-190TFIm .
B , Mixtures of pCD-190 ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 ) or pCD-190TFIm ( lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) and pRSV-G-gal plasmid DNA were transfected into Jurkat cells .
Amount of CAT plasmid DNA used was 15 ug ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or 7.5 ug ( lanes 3-8 ) .
Cells were treated with PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) and PMA ( 10mM ) for 20 h ( lanes 5 and 6 ) or 8 h ( lanes 7 and 8 ) before harvest .
CAT activity was measured as described ( 36 ) .
Experiments were repeated three times , and typical results are shown .
The differences between each set of experiments were within 10 % .
CAT activity of pCD-190TFIim was shown above each lane relative to that of pCD-190 under same assay conditions .
C , Gel retardation analysis was carried out by using the wild-type probe shown in Fig .
1B or the mutant probe .
The nucleotide sequence of mutant probe is the same as the wild-type probe except for 2 nucleotides as shown in A .
The amounts of HIV-TF1 used are indicated above each lane .
We also did renaturation experiments after the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
After isolation and renaturation , only the protein samples containing the 39 and 40 kDa polypeptides generated the specific retarded band in a gel retardation assay ( data not shown ) .
The behavior of the 39 and 40 kDa polypeptides in various column chromatographies ( data not shown ) suggested that the two polypeptides had very similar biochemical properties , and the difference between them may be a modification such as phosphorylation or degradation .
DNA-binding properties of To demonstrate the specific binding of the purified HIV-TFI1 with the HIV-1 LTR , a DNase I footprinting experiment was done .
The purified HIV-TFI protected a region corresponding to nucleotides -173 to -159 ( Fig .
2A , lane 2 ) .
To examine the functional relationship between HIV-TF1 and HIV EBP , we used the purified HIV-TF1 and the purified EBP in a DNase I footprint experiment .
The concentration of purified EBP required to observe a clear footprint on the HIV-1 LTR was lower in the presence of HIV-TF1 than in its absence ( Fig .
2A , lanes 3-7 ) .
These results suggested that binding of HIV-TFl increased binding of the factor to the enhancer region .
The DNA sequence of the HIV-TF1-binding site is similar to that of the USF site in the Ad MLP and there is only one base difference out of 10 nucleotides between them ( Fig .
2B ) .
To examine whether purified HIV-TFI1 also binds to the USF site , a gel retardation analysis was done .
Both probes containing the HIV-TF1-binding site of HIV LTR or the USF site of the Ad Figure 5 .
Phosphatase treatment of HIV-TF1 .
Purified HIV-TFI was treated with ( + ) or without ( - ) potato acid phosphatase .
After incubation , DNA-binding activity was measured in a gel retardation assay with a probe described in Fig .
1B .
In a control experiment , DNA-binding activity of purified HIV EBP was assayed in a similar way by using the DNA probe containing the HIV enhancer ( 16 ) .
Arrows indicate the retarded band corresponding to specific DNA-protein complex .
MLP bound to the purified HIV-TFI and generated a specific retarded band ( Fig .
2B , lanes 2 and 8 ) .
To examine the relative affinity of HIV-TFI1 for the two related sequences , a competition analysis was done .
Addition of a 20-fold molar excess of competitor containing the HIV-TF1l-binding site of HIV LTR partially competed for binding of HIV-TFI to the HIV-TFI probe , while a 20-fold molar excess of competitor containing the USF site abolished the binding of HIV-TF1 completely ( Fig .
2B , lanes 3 and 5 ) .
Thus , HIV-TF1 has a higher affinity for the USF site than the HIV-TFI site in the HIV-1 LTR .
Transcriptional activation by purified HIV-TFL The effect of the purified HIV-TFI1 in stimulating transcription was examined in the WCE of HeLa cells .
When transcribed in HeLa WCE , the pCD12 plasmid DNA digested with EcoRI generated 373 nucleotide run-off transcripts corresponding to specific initiation at the in vitro CAP site ( Fig .
3 , lane 1 ) .
The EcoRI-cut pRSVCAT control template generated 291 nucleotide run-off transcripts .
Addition of purified HIV-TF1 stimulated transcription from the HIV-1 promoter 2.5- to 4.9-fold , but did not stimulate transcription from the RSV LTR promoter ( Fig .
3 , lane 1 , 4 , and 5 ) .
As reported previously ( 16 ) , addition of purified HIV EBP stimulated transcription from the HIV-1 promoter 4.2-fold ( Fig .
3 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Interesitingly , the effects of HIV-TFI and EBP were synergistic , and simultaneous addition of both proteins stimulated transcription from the HIV-1 promoter 20-fold ( Fig .
3 , lane 3 ) .
Disruption of HIV-TF1-binding site To examine whether the HIV-TF1-binding site in the HIV LTR functions as a transcriptional control element , we introduced a mutation ( Fig .
4A ) By using a gel retardation analysis , it was confirmed that HIV-TF1 could not bind to this mutant promoter ( Fig .
4C ) , The mutant HIV promoter was linked to the bacterial CAT gene to generate the plasmid pCD-190TFIm .
Two CAT constructs containing the wild-type ( pCD-190 ) or mutant promoter ( pCD-190TF1Im ) were transfected into Jurkat T-cells and CAT activity was assayed .
The level of CAT activity obtained by the mutant promoter was about 40 % of that by wild-type promoter ( Fig .
4B , lanes 1-4 ) .
Activation of Jurkat T cells with PHA and 4 ( 3-phorobol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) induces the activation of HIV EBP ( 11 ) .
Therfore , treatment of cells by PHA and PMA stimulated CAT activity with pCD-190 about 10-fold ( Fig .
4B , lanes 3 , 5 , and 7 ) .
In the presence of PHA and PMA , the level of activity with mutant promoter was about 76 % of that with wild-type promoter ( Fig .
4B , lanes 5-8 ) .
Thus , the HIV-TF1-binding site is a positive element for transcriptional control , although in the presence of an excess of activated EBP , the HIV-TF1 site appears to be not so important for transcription of HIV-TFI .
© Phosphatase treatment of HIV-TF1 The HIV EBP , NF-xB , is activated by phosphorylation of its inhibitor IxB ( 22 ) .
To examine whether HIV-TFIl is also regulated by phosphorylation , we treated the purified HIV-TFI1 with or without acid phosphatase and assayed them in parallel for DNA-binding activity .
DNA-binding activity was greatly reduced by phosphatase treatment ( Fig .
5 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
In a control experiment , the purified HIV EBP was treated with phosphatase and its DNA-binding activity was examined .
Although the mobility of protein-DNA complex was changed , no change in the DNA-binding activity was detected after phosphatase treatment ( Fig .
5 , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Thus , the phosphorylation of HIV-TF1 appeared to be essential for its DNA-binding activity .

17 4693 DISCUSSION We have purified the protein HIV-TFI1 , which binds to the specific site in the HIV-1 LTR and stimulates transcription from the HIV-1 promoter in vitro .
The DNA sequence of the HIV-TF1-binding site is similar to that of USF site in the Ad MLP , and only one base out of 10 is different between the two sequences .
Although a sequence homologous with USF site in the HIV LTR was noted previously ( 30 ) , our report probably gave the first evidence showing that the factor binding to this site stimulates transcription from the HIV-1 promoter .
The molecular weight of purified HIV-TF1 was 39,000 and 40,000 and is indistinguishable from that of purified USF from HeLa cells , 43,000 and 44,000 ( 37 ) .
Furthermore , purified HIV-TFI bound to the USF site in the Ad MLP , and was perfectly stable at temperatures as high as 100°C ( data not shown ) like purified USF ( 37 ) .
These results strongly suggest that HIV-TFI is identical or closely related to USF .
Recently , cDNA clones encoding USF have been isolated ( 38 ) .
Interestingly , another protein , TEF3 , which binds to the USF site in the Ad MLP was also identifited by cDNA cloning ( 39 ) .
Both proteins contain a helix-loop-helix and a leucine zipper structure , but the sequence of USF is totaly different from that of TEF3 .
Thus , multiple proteins which bind to the USF site appear to exist .
Therefore , the possibility that HIV-TFI is different from USF remains .
Using a transfection assay , we have shown that the HIV promoter containing a mutation in the HIV-TF1-binding site has a reduced activity , about 40 % of that of wild-type promoter in Jurkat T-cells .
In Jurkat cells activated by PHA and PMA , the effect of disruption of the HIV-TF1-binding site on the level of transcription was lower than that in the absence of PHA and PMA .
Since treatment of cells with PHA and PMA increased the level of activated HIV EBP , may not dramatically affect HIV transcription in the presence of a saturating amount of EBP .
Thus , our results suggest that HIV-TFI may be a key regulator only when the level of EBP is low , such as in latently infected cells .
Phosphatase treatment of the purified HIV-TFI greatly reduced its DNA-binding activity .
Therefore , it is possible that some extracellur stimuli , which leads to virus production from latently infected cells , may activate HIV transcription partly by phosphorylation of HIV-TFI1 .
