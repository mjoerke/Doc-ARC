It now remains to be investigated which parameters determine the repertoire of the memory response and possibly restrict its diversity after subsequent antigenic challenges .
To address this question , we took advantage of a panel of CD8 * T cell clones from the joint of a rheumatoid arthritis patient and selected for their reactivity against a single MHC/peptide complex .
Characterization of both TCR chains documented a great diversity among those clones and the persistence of clonotypes over a 2-yr period .
Strikingly , despite the observed repertoire heterogeneity , all clones displayed a narrow range of MHC/peptide density requirements in cytotoxicity assays ( ED ; , between 9 and 36 nM ) .
TCR affinities were then indirectly estimated by blocking CD8 interaction with an anti-CD8 mAb .
We found a wide range of TCR affinities among the different clonotypes that segregated with VB usage .
We thus propose that during an in vivo chronic response , a narrow range of avidity of the TCR-CD8 complex conditions long-term clonotype persistence , and that the level of CD8 contribution is adjusted to keep clonotypes with variable TCR affinities within this avidity window .
- The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 162 ; 6351-6358. he essential role of CD8 * T cells is the recognition and lysis of virally infected cells ( 1 ) .
This recognition of an immunogenic viral epitope presented by a class I MHC molecule imposes the selection of a restricted set of T cells whose TCRs are able to bind to the MHC/peptide complex with sufficient affinity ( 2 ) .
In fact , numerous studies have demonstrated the existence of a stringent selection process among reactive T cell clones leading to conserved TCR structural features at the combinatorial and/or junctional levels ( 3 , 4 ) .
However , in recent years , molecular characterization of immunogenic peptides and their MHC-restrict-ing elements has allowed to directly analyze the responsive T cell populations against a given MHC/peptide complex .
The data obtained demonstrated that aside from the expected homogeneity of TCR features seen in some T cell responses , other responses involved diverse T cell populations with very distinct TCR structures ( 5-7 ) .
Interestingly , a number of recent reports have shown that when the reactive repertoire seen in the primary response was diverse ( as assessed by VB usage ) , this diversity was maintained after in vitro reexposure to the immunizing peptide/MHC complex ( 8-10 ) , thus suggesting that T cells with distinct TCR affinities can *Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale , U463 , Institute of Biology , and *Department of Pharmacology , College of Pharmacy , Nantes , France Received for publication September 28 , 1998 .

The remaining matter of debate is whether the recruitment of effectors from the memory pool in vivo will be influenced by repetitive Ag reexposure , i.e .
, will be progressively restricted to clones with particular affinities/ avidities .
In a previous study , we have shown that in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis , CD8 * T cells reactive against EBV proteins were dramatically amplified in synovial fluid compared with peripheral blood ( 11 ) .
To address the aforementioned question , we focused our analysis on one patient whose response was predominantly directed toward a peptide originated from the EBV trans-activator BZLF1 presented in the MHC class I B4002 context ( 12 ) .
In fact , this reactivity could account for most of the observed T cell subset amplification , as cell lines established after immunosorting with V B-specific Abs were reactive against this particular epitope .
Twenty-seven months later , we obtained synovial membrane-in-filtrating lymphocytes from the same patient .
We have shown previously by cytofluorometric analysis that VB usage among joint-infiltrating T lymphocytes from this patient was very diverse and stable over time ( 11 ) .
In the present study , we performed a structural analysis of TCR a- and B-chains from BZLF1-reactive clones obtained from both samples to formally document the diversity of the responsive population and to look for possible shared features between the different TCR used .
Next , we took advantage of this very diverse repertoire to analyze the contribution of TCR affini-ties/avidities in the long-term persistence of the different clono-types .
We demonstrate that despite significant differences in TCR affinities among the different in vivo selected clones , these clones displayed very comparable MHC/peptide density requirements due to a variable contribution of the coreceptor CD8 in the interaction with the peptide/MHC complex , thus strongly suggesting that avidity and not affinity is the critical parameter governing long-term clonotype persistence .

Lymphocytes from the first sample were sorted using VB-specific Abs directed against the subpopulations that were overrepresented in the inflamed joint as compared with peripheral blood ( 11 ) and cloned .
In the second sample , all CD8-positive lymphocytes from the synovial membrane were sorted out and randomly cloned .
Among all of the clones reactive against EBV proteins , only those reactive against the BZLFI1 epitope SENDRLRLL presented in the HLA-B4002 were selected for the present study .
These clones were maintained in RPMI 1640 10 % human serum supplemented with rIL-2 ( 100 IU/ml ) and restimulated every 6 wk under polyclonal activation ( irradiated PBL and EBV-trans-formed B cell lines ( BLCL ) , * leukoagglutinine ( 1 pg/ml ) , and IL-2 ) , as previously described ( 13 ) .

Since this first PCR resulted in numerous nonspecific bands due to the use of degenerated primers , a second PCR was conducted on 0.5 pl of the first PCR completed to 50 ul with 1X Mix Tag DNA polymerase ; 12.5 pM of each degenerated primer , VBA and VBB ; and 25 pM of a nested specific CB primer , CBII 5-GTGGCCAGGCA CACCAGTGTG-3 ' with the following cycle : 5X ( 94°C for 1 min , 60°C for 4 min , and 72°C for 1 min ) ; 35 % ( 94°C for 1 min , 45°C for 2.5 min , and 72°C for 1 min ) .
Bands of interest were purified and sequenced , as described previously for Va sequences .
Cytotoxicity assays Cytotoxicity was measured in a standard 4-h * `` Cr release assay .
Briefly , 2 X 10° autologous BLCL were labeled with 50 Ci of *'Cr ( Na , `` CrO , ; Oris Industries , Gif sur Yvette , France ) for 1 h at 37°C , washed five times , and pulsed with various concentrations of peptide for 1.5 h in RPMI 1640 10 % human serum .
After two washes , target cells were incubated with the different T cell clones at an E : T ratio of 10:1 in 150 pl of RPMI 1640 10 % human serum for 4 h at 37°C .
Twenty-five microliters of supernatants were then removed and mixed with 100 pl of scintillation mixture ( Optiphase Supermix , Wallac , U.K. ) for liquid scintillation counting .
For CD8 blockage experiments , T cells were incubated with the anti-CD8a « mAb B9.11 ( Coultronics , Margency , France ) for 15 min before incubation with the target cells .
EDs , were estimated by fitting the cytotoxicity response curves with the GraFit software ( Erithacus Software , Staines , UK ) using a single binding site model .
For alanine scan analysis , the different clones were tested for cytotoxicity against autologous BLCL loaded with 10 , 0.5 , or 0.25 uM of each peptide variant ( derived from the wild-type BZLF1 9-mer peptide by alanine substitution at each position ) at an E : T ratio of 30:1 .
Results are expressed as percentage of the cytotoxicity obtained with the wild-type peptide in the same conditions .
Cytokine production The melanoma cell line M88 expressing HLA-B4002 was used as APC in this test because it was easier to exclude M88 cells by size from T cell clones in the following flow-cytometric analysis .
M88 cells were pulsed for 1.5 h at 37°C with various concentrations of the BZLF1 peptide in RPMI 1640 medium without FCS and washed twice to avoid autopresentation by T cells .
T cell clones ( 2 X 10° ) were stimulated by 4 X 10° peptide-pulsed M88 cells in 2 ml of complete medium without IL-2 in the presence of 10 of Brefeldin A ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) for 6 h at 37°C in 5 % CO ; .
For intracytoplasmic staining , cells were then fixed for 10 min at room temperature in a solution of PBS 4 % paraformaldehyde , washed twice in large volumes of PBS , and stored at 4°C until immunofluorescence analysis .
Flow-cytometric analysis of intracellular cytokines Fixed stimulated T cell clones were stained for cytokines using the method described by Jung et al .
( 37 ) .
Briefly , fixed cells were stained with the different mAbs at a concentration of 5 pg/ml ( shown to provide optimal staining for mAbs ) for 30 min at room temperature .
Monoclonal FITC-conjugated anti-human IFN-y ( 48.B3 ) and PE-conjugated anti-human IL-2 ( MQ1-17H12 ) Ab were purchased from PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) .
Reagent dilutions and washes were done with PBS containing 0.1 % BSA ( A-9647 ; Sigma , Saint Quentin Fallavier , France ) and 0.1 % saponin ( Sig-ma ) .
After staining , cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer using Cellquest software ( Becton Dickinson , Grenoble , France ) .
Results Structural features of « and BB TCR chains of T cell clones selected in vivo against a single MHC/peptide complex To evaluate the diversity and stability of TCR repertoire of T cells involved in a chronic in vivo response , we performed a structural analysis of TCR chains from synovial T cell clones derived from a patient whose response was predominantly directed against a single viral peptide/MHC complex ( BZLF1/HLA-B4002 ) .
Since recently published x-ray crystallographic data of TCR/peptide/ MHC demonstrate an implication of both the a- and the -chain of the TCR in peptide/MHC ( 14-17 ) , it is crucial to sequence both TCR chains to analyze structural constraints imposed by recognition of a given HLA peptide .
In the case of clones established after V B-specific irnimunosorting , characterization of CDR3B was conducted by sequencing RT-PCR products using specific VB primers .
In the case of 6353 clones randomly isolated from synovial membrane infiltrating lym-phocytes , we developed an RT-PCR approach using degenerated VB primers .
Va transcript amplification was performed by multiplex PCR because absence of allelic exclusion in the a locus prohibits the use of degenerated primers .
Va and VB sequences of the different clones are presented in Fig .
1 .
We found that clones from the second sample expressing BV1S1 , BV2S1 , BV14S1 , and BV22S1 were already present in the first sample collected 2 yr earlier .
The remaining clones whose VB had not been analyzed in the first sample ( namely BV6S4 and BV18S1 ) corresponded to minor subsets for which specific amplification was nevertheless demonstrated in the first sample by immunoscope analysis in a previous study ( 11 ) .
Whether this repertoire persistence results from a process of affinity selection will be discussed below in light of the functional analysis .
The most striking feature was the important repertoire diversity of reactive clones , with 9 VB , 7 JB , 10 Va , and 11 Ja represented .
Because of this diversity , it was relevant to look for a selection process on CDR3 only among clones sharing at least one of these elements .
Among clones using V B2 , two clones , namely A2.3 and A2.8 , shared the same Va , Ja , V B , and J elements .
For these two clones , structural constraints were also apparent on CDR3 regions , with equal length of both CDR3a and B .
Moreover , these two clones shared conserved N-encoded residues in the CDR3 ( 3 region , suggesting that the TCR structural constraints in these clones resulted from a stringent selection process .
These CDR3 sequence homologies disappeared when a different combination of Va/VB was considered , as can be seen with clone A2.19 ( VB2 ) , which used different Va , Ja , JB than clones A2.3 and A2.8 , with clones A13.16 and A13.26 , which shared the same V ( and JB , but used different « -chains , or among the five V B22 clones .
A similar conclusion could be drawn when considering clones using the same Va , thus suggesting that there was no obvious predominance of the a- or the -chain in selecting reactive clones .
Nevertheless , although there was no preferential association between any particular Va and Ja , a recurrent use of particular Va and Ja elements was observed : Va 28s1 ( three clones ) ; Va 25s1 , 22s1 , and 101s1 ( two clones each ) ; Ja 8 ( three clones ) ; Ja 28 and 50 ( two clones each ) .
In fact , all clones except one used at least one recurrent Va or one recurrent Ja .
This observation is reminiscent of the over-representation of JB 2s3 and 287 , regardless of VB usage that we detected by immunoscope among B4002/BZLF1 reactive clones in a previous study ( 11 ) .
Thus , the great diversity observed in our panel of clones demonstrates that B4002/BZLF1 is very permissive , i.e .
, selects a large set of V and J elements , each of which probably engages in different types of contacts with it .
In this regard , clones expressing VB2 and V B22 that were represented by three and five clonotypes , respectively , were of peculiar interest in that they could be considered as representative of stringent or moderate TCR structural constraints both on combinatorial and junctional diversity .
We therefore further investigated their different modes of contact with the selecting HLA/peptide by alanine scan analysis .
Alanine scan analysis The results of the alanine scan analysis are represented on Fig .
2 .
Alanine substitution in positions 2 and 9 , characterized as peptide anchor residues by computer modelization , abrogated response in the former case , but had little effect for the latter .
This is consistent with the fact that alanine at position 9 is frequently used as an anchor residue in B4002 , as determined by HLA Peptide Binding Prediction ( 18 ) .

Each value represents the mean lysis from at least three different experiments performed at an E : T ratio of 10:1 .
SDs were within 15 % of the mean .
by the B-chain .
This similar profile was expected since those clones only differed by 1 aa on their B-chain .
In contrast , these two clones displayed marked differences in their sensitivity to substitution at positions 3 and 4 , while they only differed by 3 aa on their « -chain in the CDR3 region , thus suggesting the strong involvement of their CDR3 « in contacting the HLA/peptide complex .
Not surprisingly , clone A2.19 , which used a different showed a distinct pattern of sensivity to substitution at these positions .
However , this clone , which shared VB2 with A2.3 and A2.8 , but markedly differed in its CDR3 $ region , was almost insensitive to substitution at position 7 , thus reinforcing the critical contribution of CDR3 regions of V B2 clones in establishing contact with the HLA/peptide complex .
In striking contrast , V B22 clones displayed a very similar pattern of reactivities despite great combinatorial and junctional diversity .
In particular , it is noteworthy that they were all very sensitive to alanine substitution at positions 7 and 8 , but rather insensitive to substitution at position 6 .
This would indicate that contribution of was less critical in clones V B22 than in clones V B2 , possibly due to a stronger engagement of CDR1B and CDR2¢ in the interaction with HLA/peptide .
This would be consistent with crystallographic data of TCR/MCH/pep-tide complex , demonstrating variable involvement of CDR1f and CDR2 $ in the contact ( 14 , 15 ) .
Functional analysis of BZLFI-reactive T cell clones The aim of this analysis was to determine whether we could detect functional differences between the different VB families of clones , and more specifically between VB2 and VB22 , which could be related to their different level of structural constraints .
Cytotoxic activity of 11 synovial T cell clones was evaluated against autologous BLCL loaded with various concentrations of the relevant 9-mer BZLF1 peptide .
As shown on Fig .
3 , all clones displayed a very similar curve of cytotoxicity , except for clone 6.1 , which reproducedly showed a lower reactiv-ity .
EDs , were estimated for each clone from at least three distinct experiments and are reported in Table I. EDs , ranged from 9-36 nM , showing that all of these clones were very similar in terms of peptide/MHC requirements for cytotoxicity , regardless of their TCR diversity .
In a recent report ( 19 ) , Schodin et al .
demonstrated strong correlations between the number of MHC/peptide on the target cell required for cytolysis , the number of interacting TCR 6355 complexes , and the affinity of the TCR .
Thus , the avidity of the TCR complex ( understood as the sum of TCR and coreceptor interactions with MHC/peptide ) can be estimated by the density of MHC/peptide required for cytolysis .
Our data thus suggested that in vivo selection and long-term persistence determined this narrow range of EDs , , , i.e .
, of avidity of the TCR/coreceptor complex .
The next step was to investigate whether this selection on the basis of avidity correlated with a stringent selection on TCR affinity .
Numerous studies have demonstrated the stabilizing role of the CDS coreceptor in TCR/MHC/peptide engagement ( 20-23 ) , and evaluation of CD8 dependency in Ag recognition has been used to indirectly estimate TCR affinity ( 24 ) .
We therefore investigated the contribution of the CD8 coreceptor in the recognition of peptide-loaded BLCL by our different clones to compare their TCR affinity .
To this end , we performed cytotoxicity experiments in the presence of saturating amounts of anti-CD8 mAb ( Fig .
4 ) .
For all but one clone , blocking the CD8 coreceptor resulted in a significant shift of the cytotoxicity response curve , thus demonstrating a contribution of CD8-MHC interaction in the stabilization of the TCR recognition complex .
As shown on Fig .
4 , the level of CD8 dependency was very variable from one clone to another .
Nevertheless , when the ratio between EDs , in the presence or absence of CD8 mAb was calculated and clones ranked accordingly ( Table I ) , we noted that CD8 dependency correlated with VB usage : most V B22 clones were weakly CD8 dependent , whereas VB2 and VB13 were strongly CD8 dependent .
No significant difference in the level of CD3 or CD8 expression could be detected by FACS analysis that might have accounted for these differences in CD8 dependency .
Therefore , these variations most likely reflected differences in TCR affinity , with TCR using V B2 and VB13 being of lower affinity for the HLA-B4002/BZLF1 complex than TCRVB6 and most TCRV B22 .
Interestingly , clones A2.3 and A2.8 , which only differed by 3 aa in their CDR3 « and 1 aa in their CDR3 $ , showed marked differences in their CD8 dependency , thus reinforcing the critical contribution of CDR3s in TCR affinity among V B2 clones , whereas clones VB22 showed rather homogenous CDS dependency despite marked differences in their CDR3 sequences .
In most cases , a significant cytotoxic response could be restored in the presence of anti-CD8 mAb by increasing peptide-loading concentrations , and the response curves obtained paralleled those in the absence of CD8 blockage .
Thus , we show that in most in-stances , increasing the density of peptide/MHC complexes at the surface of the target cell can compensate for the loss of global avidity due to CD8 blockage , in agreement with previously published data ( 25 ) .
In this regard , clone 22.34 displayed a peculiar pattern of reactivity : its behavior was distinct from that of the other VB22 T cell clones in that its cytotoxic response curve in the presence of anti-CD8 mAb consistently plateaued at a much lower value than the maximum obtained in the absence of CD8 blockage .
This indicates that in the case of clone 22.34 , preventing CDS-MHC interaction significantly affected the affinity of its TCR for the MHC/peptide complex , whereas for all of the other V B22 clones , blockage of CD8 left their TCR affinity intact .
We then asked whether clone 6.1 , whose cytotoxic response was almost unaffected by CD8 blockage , was intrinsically CD8 independent or whether its CD8 dependency could vary with the affinity of its TCR for the peptide presented .
We therefore tested the cytotoxicity of clone 6.1 against BLCL loaded with the variant peptide A7 ( alanine substitution at position 7 of the BZLF1 9-mer peptide ) previously shown to behave as a weak agonist for this clone .
As shown on Fig .
5 , the response curve against A7 was shifted to the right compared with that against the BZLF1 peptide , 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6356 100 BV22S1 it 22.18 80 - -- @ -- _ 2219 -- & & -- - 22.28 60 -- - @ -- _ 22.13 40 -| -- ¥ -- _ 22.34 20 & W 33 > - 0 6 o & $ 100 5 BV6S4 -- BR -- 6.1 0 § - $ 07 q .

CD3 and CD8 expression was tested in parallel by indirect immunofluorescence and showed no significant variation between clones .
as expected for a weak agonist .
But the most striking feature was that the response against A7 was totally abrogated by addition of an anti-CD8 mAb .
Thus , CD8 interaction , which was dispensable for the recognition of the full agonist BZLF1 peptide by clone 6.1 , became absolutely required when a weaker agonist was presented to this clone .
This clone can thus modulate its CD8 dependency depending on the affinity of its TCR for the peptide/MHC complex presented .
This observation is in agreement with a recent report from Viola et al .

Sensitivity to blocking by an anti-CD8 mAb depends on the peptide presented .
The cytotoxic response of clone 6.1 was evaluated against autologous BLCL loaded with either the native BZLFI1 peptide or the A7 variant ( alanine substitution at position 7 ) in the absence ( open symbols ) or in the presence ( filled symbols ) of saturating amounts of anti-CD8a « mAb .
anti-coreceptor Abs was inversely correlated to the efficiency of TCR-ligand interaction .
Finally , to look for possible differences in quality of TCR engagement between the different clones , we analyzed their cytokine response .
All of those clones have been characterized previously as being of the Tel phenotype , i.e .
, producing IFN-y and IL-2 following stimulation ( data not shown ) .
As shown on Fig .
6 , all of the clones tested were capable of producing IFN-y and IL-2 in response to BZLF1 , and although there was some variability in the percentage of cytokine-producing cells among the different clones , these variations could not be correlated with VB usage .
When intensity of fluorescence was plotted instead of percentage of positive cells , identical results were obtained demonstrating that the amount of cytokine produced was strictly correlated with the number of responding cells ( not shown ) .
Thus , the efficiency of cytokine production triggering through the TCR could not distinguish between the different VB families .
Discussion In the present study , we first analyzed TCR a- and B-chain sequences of B4002/BZLF1l-reactive clones that were specifically amplified in the joint of a rheumatoid arthritis patient .
The repertoire was very diverse , which is consistent with the recognition of a dominant epitope , as demonstrated in previous reports ( 5 , 6 , 27 ) .
In fact , EBV early lytic cycle proteins have been shown to be frequent targets of CTL in primary and memory responses ( 28 , 29 ) .
No obvious shared structural features could be evidenced among clones sharing the same VB , except for some V B2 clones , in which a selection process led to structural constraints both at the combinatorial and junctional diversity level .

Production of cytokines by six BZLFl-reactive T cell clones representing different VB families .
T cell clones were stimulated with peptide-loaded M88 melanoma cell line for 6 h , and production of IL-2 and IFN-y was assessed by fluorescent intracellular labeling ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Results are expressed as percentages of positive cells .
The typical experiment presented is representative of three distinct tests .
We next investigated whether the different stringencies of constraints among clones were correlated with TCR affinities by evaluating their CD8 dependency .
In this regard , a previous study from Campos-Lima et al .
( 7 ) suggested that stringent structural constraints of the TCR imposed by recognition of subdominant EBV epitopes were linked to selection of CD8-independent ( i.e .
, high affinity ) clones .
Our data do not support such a strict correlation between structural constraints and TCR affinity since clones that were tightly constrained , such as A2.3 and A2.8 , turned out to be more CD8 dependent than clones V B22 , which were loosely con-strained .
We would rather propose that the use of a particular VB has a critical influence on TCR affinity for a given peptide/MHC complex since , in our model , it was the main parameter that segregated with CD8 dependency .
This would be in agreement with recent crystallographic data of mouse and human TCR/HLA-pep-tide complex that clearly demonstrated that contribution of B CDRs to the global binding energy is variable as compared with that of « CDRs ( 14 , 15 ) .
In the case of murine 2C TCR bound to H-2K*-dEV8 , only one residue of the peptide was contacted by a single CDR3 $ residue , whereas CDR1B and CDR2 ( engaged in multiple contacts with peptide and HLA residues .
The opposite situation was seen in human A6 and B7 TCR-contacting HLA A2/Tax that shared the same VB : in the case of the A6 TCR , CDR1 $ engaged in a single contact with the peptide and none with the HLA , CDR2f did not contact the HLA , whereas its CDR3B contacted four peptide residues and one HLA residue .
In the case of the B7 TCR , there was no contact between CDR 13 and peptide or HLA , only two contacts between and HLA , but three peptide residues contacted by the CDR3 region ( 30 ) .
Therefore , there seemed to be a balance between the contribution of germline B CDR1/CDR2 residues and CDR3 # residues in the stabilization of the TCR/MHC/peptide complex .
We therefore hypothesize that VB2 has an intrinsically weak ability to contact the B4002/BZLF1 complex that was compensated in clones using this VB by a stringent selection on CDR3a and 3 regions , whereas V B22 usage conferred a higher basal affinity for the B4002/BZLF1 complex , thus allowing more degrees of freedom on both combinatorial and junctional diversity .
This hypothesis is further supported by our alanine scan analysis showing the homogenous reactivity profiles displayed by V B22 clones when compared with those of V B2 clones .
A striking finding of our study was the narrow range of MHC/ peptide densities required to trigger cytolysis in our in vivo selected clones ( EDs , between 9 and 36 nM ) .
One explanation would be that a selection took place during in vitro expansion of the clones that resulted in the observed range of reactivities .
However , we can formally rule out this hypothesis for the following reasons : first , clones were randomly obtained from CD8- or VB-sorted joint-infiltrating lymphocytes by polyclonal activation with mito-gen , IL-2 , and allogeneic feeder cells , and we have documented previously that this procedure does not result in any selection bias , i.e .
, the panel of recovered clones is representative of that selectively amplified in the joint of the patient ( 11 ) .
Second , clones were further expanded in vitro by rounds of nonspecific ( mitogen ) stimulations and not by specific restimulations with peptide-loaded APC .
In fact , the EDs , of each clone was remarkably constant over time and independent of the number of successive restimulations .
Finally , another group from our institute has used the same procedure to obtain tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte clones , and in their case they obtained a panel of clones that varied greatly in the density of MHC/peptide required for cytotoxicity ( 31 ) .
We are therefore confident that the narrow range of reactivities that we observed in our clones resulted from an in vivo selection process and not a culture bias .
This suggests that , in our model , 1 ) reactive clones were selected in vivo by APC presenting a homogenous density of BZLFI peptide , and 2 ) they represented only a fraction of the repertoire potentially reactive against this particular MHC/peptide complex .
Moreover , since we have found persisting clones of both weak and high TCR affinity in the two samples taken at a 2-yr interval , we conclude that high TCR affinity per se did not govern persistence of clones in this chronic response , but rather that persisting clones were selected on the basis of their global avidity .
Indeed , the homogenous reactivity of all clones , both in terms of cytotoxicity and lymphokine production , could be explained by a differential level of CD8 contribution that compensated for differences in TCR af-finities .
This homogenous reactivity is not a specific feature of the response against the BZLF1-B4002 complex , since a preliminary analysis of the response against another EBV peptide from the BMLFI1 protein presented by HLA-A2 suggests selection of clones with a restricted range of avidities despite variable contribution of CD8 ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the critical parameter for long-term selection in vivo being global reactivity to a given number of MHC/peptide complexes , we propose that maximal CD8 engagement ( illustrated by clone A13.16 in this study ) will define the minimal TCR affinity required to reach the avidity threshold .
Once this threshold is reached , an increase in TCR affinity would not lead to stronger activation , and thus clones with higher TCR affinities would have no selective advantage .
This would be consistent with the recent report of Busch et al .
, showing that although reactivation of memory T cells was dependent on appropriate Ag 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6358 reexposure , the extent and duration of their subsequent in vivo expansion were independent of Ag quantity or stability ( 32 ) .
On the other hand , we were intrigued by the observation of such a variable contribution of CD8 between the different clones .
The previous report from Alexander et al .
suggested that CD8 dependency was relative and correlated exclusively with the amounts of antigenic determinant densities , i.e .
, that at low MHC/peptide den-sity , presumed to represent physiologic conditions , all CTL clones needed at least partial CD8 interaction ( 25 ) .
Our data are in discrepancy with this hypothesis since we could find among clones selected in vivo , one clone , clone 6.1 , that remained CD8 independent even at low density of MHC/peptide .
Moreover , we showed that this clone became very CD8 dependent when confronted to a variant peptide differing by one amino acid substitution in agreement with a previous report ( 26 ) .
We do agree nevertheless that inhibition by anti-CD8 mAb can be reversed by high doses of peptide in CD8-dependent clones .
We would thus propose that the level of CD8 contribution is a characteristic of the response of a given clone against a given MHC/peptide complex .
Since this contribution resulted in at least a 1000-fold increase in avidity in clones using V B2 or V B13 , we wondered why such an important contribution was not seen in clones using V B22 or V B6 , which would have resulted in an even higher avidity .
The fact that we could not recover such clones from the joint of our patient suggests that in this in vivo response against EBV , there was a ceiling of maximal avidity above which clones were counter-selected .
This would be consistent with a recent report from Al-exander-Miller et al .
, showing that proliferation of high avidity cell lines was inhibited by high ligand density and that it could be restored by blocking CD8 interaction ( 33 ) .
In conclusion , our data suggest that the extent and diversity of the in vivo CTL response are conditioned by two main parameters : 1 ) the permissivity of the selecting MHC/peptide complex that will determine the size of the potentially reactive repertoire , and 2 ) the density of MHC/peptide complex presented on the APC in vivo that will define a window of avidity .
The coreceptor CD8 by its variable contribution to the stabilization of the TCR/MHC/peptide complex can buffer differences in TCR affinities to maintain clones within this window of avidity , and thus plays a critical role in persistence of the response diversity .
