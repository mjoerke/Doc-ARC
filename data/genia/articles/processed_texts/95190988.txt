4 LMP-1 Activates NF- « B by Targeting the Inhibitory Molecule IxBa JOSE A. HERRERO , * PAUL MATHEW , ** anp CARLOS V. PAYA* `` `` * Divisions of Experimental Pathology , `` Infectious Diseases , `` and Hematology-Oncology , `` Mayo Clinic , Rochester , Minnesota 55905 Received 12 September 1994/Accepted 12 October 1994 LMP-1 , an Epstein-Barr virus membrane protein expressed during latent infection , has oncogenic proper-ties , as judged from its ability to transform B lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts .
LMP-1 induces the expression of be/2 , an oncogene which protects cells from apoptosis , as well as of genes encoding other proteins involved in cell regulation and growth control .
The mechanisms by which LMP-1 upregulates these proteins is unknown , but it is plausible that LMP-1 modifies signal transduction pathways that result in the activation of one or more transcription factors that ultimately regulate transcription of oncogenic genes .
NF-KB , a transcription factor controlling the expression of genes involved in cell activation and growth control , has been shown to be activated by LMP-1 .
The mechanism ( s ) regulating this activation remains unknown .
Our data indicate that increased NF-B DNA binding and functional activity are present in B-lymphoid cells stably or transiently expressing LMP-1 .
is selectively modified in LMP-l-expressing B cells .
A phosphorylated form of IxBa and increased protein turnover-degradation correlate with increased NF-KB nuclear translocation .
This results in increased transcription of NF-B-dependent-genes , including those encoding p105 and IxBa ( MAD3 ) .
These results indicate that LMP-1 activates NF-KB in B-cell lines by targeting IBa .
Identification of the pathways activated by LMP-1 to result in posttranslational modifications of IxBa will aid in determining the role of this virus-host cell protein interaction in Epstein-Barr virus-mediated oncogenesis .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a major cause of infectious mononucleosis and is a prototypic oncogenic virus .
EBV has also been associated with Burkitt 's lymphoma and a variety of B-cell lymphomas in immunocompromised individuals , notably posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease ( 17 , 30 , 43 ) .
Similar to other members of the herpesvirus family , EBV can remain in a latent state in B lymphocytes .
During latent infection , different EBV proteins , including six nuclear proteins ( EBNAs 1 , 2 , 3A , 3B , 3C , and LP ) , three integral membrane proteins ( LMP -2A , and -2B ) , and two small RNAs ( EBER1 and -2 ) , can be expressed ( 36 ) .
LMP-1 is a plasma membrane protein containing a transmembrane and a cytoplasmic domain which forms a tight patch within the cytoplasmic membrane ( 25 , 26 ) .
Its individual role in promoting cell transformation has been clearly demonstrated : transfection of the LMP-1 gene is sufficient to transform rodent fibroblasts and normal human B lymphocytes , and EBV lacking the LMP-1 gene does not transform B lymphocytes ( 19 , 41 ) .
The mechanisms mediating LMP -induced oncogenesis are yet to be elucidated .
Evidence of cell activation ( increase in CD23 and CD40 receptors ) and upregulation of adhesion molecules ( LFA1I , LFA3 , and ICAM1 ) is present in LMP-1-transfected cells , reflecting modulation of potential oncogenic mechanisms ( 42 ) .
Also , although the issue is controversial , LMP-1 has been directly associated with the activation of proto-oncogenes such as bel2 that render B lymphocytes resistant to apoptotic death ( 10 , 14 , 28 , 34 ) .
Whether any of these mechanisms mediate LMP-1-induced oncogenesis is under study .
Other viral proteins that convey transformation phenotypes , such as bovine papillomavirus E5 , are similar in structure and membrane localization to LMP-1 and have been shown to interact with cytoplasmic membrane-associated growth factor receptors ( 32 ) .

2168 teracts with vimentin , but it is not known if it interacts with other membrane-associated molecules that potentially regulate oncogenesis ( 24 ) .
It is therefore plausible that LMP-1 results in the modification of signal transduction pathways that ultimately regulate specific transcription factors involved in gene regulation and oncogenesis .
In this study , we have focused on NF-kB , a transcription factor shown to regulate a large number of genes involved in cell activation and growth control and to be activated by different viral proteins with oncogenic potential such as hepatitis B virus HBX protein and human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) Tax ( 16 , 27 ) .
NF-kB belongs to a highly conserved family of transcription factors with N-terminal homology to the v-rel oncogene ( implicated in avian lymphoblastoid tumor pro-duction ) ( 23 ) that includes c-re/ , p50 ( NF-kB1 ) , p52 ( NF-kB2 ) , p65 ( relA ) , relB , and dorsal ( reviewed in references 3 and 31 ) .
Each of these polypeptides can form homodimers or dimerize with other Rel family members , although the prototype NF-kB is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 .
The function of NF-KB is regulated by a series of inhibitory molecules named IxBs .
The family of IxB molecules includes IxBa , IBB , IxBy , p105 , and p100 ( reviewed in reference 31 ) .
The latter two molecules are also the precursors of p50 and p52 , respectively ( 20 , 35 ) .
IxB molecules function by sequestering NF-KB in the cytoplasm , rendering it inactive ( 2 , 31 , 44 ) .
Among the different IxBs , IxBa plays a major role in the regulation of NF- « B in lymphoid cells .
Posttranslational modifications of IxBa induced by different stimuli and/or viral infection that activate different signal transduction pathways include its phosphorylation and subsequent proteolytic degradation .
This causes the release of NF-KB , which translocates to the nucleus ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 12 , 15 , 29 , 31 , 33 , 37 ) .
Because the IxBa ( MAD3 ) gene is NF-kB dependent ( 22 ) , translocation of NF-kB secondary to IxBa proteolysis will upregulate the transcription of the IxBa gene to resynthesize and replenish the cytosolic IxBa pool , thus interrupting the cycle of activation by anchoring p65 and p50 in the cytosol ( 22 , 37 ) .
In this study , we have analyzed whether and through which Vou .
69 , 1995 mechanisms NF-KB is regulated by the oncogenic EBV protein LMP in B lymphocytes .
To do so , we have used a variety of B-cell lines which stably express LMP-1 , as well as models of transient LMP-1 expression .
Our results indicate that LMP-1 activates NF-kB in B lymphocytes by targeting the phosphorylation and proteolysis of IxBa .

Results are represented as luciferase units per B-Gal unit and are representative of at least four different sets of experiments .
Nuclear extracts and EMSA .
Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were extracted by the method of Dignam et al .
( 9 ) .
Briefly , 5 X 10° to 20 X 10° cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and buffer A ( 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpipera-zine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ] , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 10 mM KCI , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 2 pg of aprotinin per ml , 2 ug of leupeptin per ml , 2 ug of pepstatin per ml , 20 mg of Pefabloc per ml ) to which 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 was added for 10 min at 4°C .
The pellet was resuspended in 20 to 30 pl of buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES , 25 % glycerol , 0.42 M NaCl , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , aprotinin , leupeptin , pepstatin , Pefabloc ) , incubated at 4°C for 30 min , and centrifugated .
Fifty microliters of buffer D ( 20 mM HEPES , 20 % [ vol/vol ] glycerol , 0.05 M KCI , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , aprotinin , leupeptin , pepstatin , Pefabloc ) was added to the supernatant .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were performed with 3 to 4 jg of nuclear protein , incubating the protein with 4 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) and 1 mg of sonicated single-stranded DNA ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , N.J. ) in a total volume of 15 to 20 pl of binding buffer for 15 min .
Then the mixture was incubated for 5 min with antibody or nonla-beled oligonucleotide and with 70,000 to 100,000 cpm of [ y- > PJATP-labeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probe at room temperature for 15 min .
The product of this reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis in a nondenaturing 5 % polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography .
DNA binding com NF-kB ACTIVATION BY LMP-1 2169 petition was assessed by preincubating the nuclear extract with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide for 5 min .
One microliter of anti-NF- « B antibodies ( anti-p65 , anti-p50 , anti-p52 , and anti-c-Rel ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , Calif. ) was added to supershift DNA-protein complexes .
Oligonucleotides used in EMSA corresponded to the NF- « B binding sequence present within the enhancer of the HIV long terminal repeat ( 5'-ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGG GGACTTTCCAGGGA-3 ' ) , to the consensus sequence of AP1 ( 5-CGCTTG ATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3 ' ) , and CREB ( 5'-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAG AGAGCTAG-3 ' ) .
Western blots ( immunoblots ) .
Cytosolic proteins were extracted in the same procedure as nuclear extracts after lysing the cells with buffer A with 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 .
The resultant supernatant contained cytosolic proteins .
Proteins ( cytosolic and nuclear ) were separated by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -10 to 12.5 % polyacrylamide gels and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane ( Millipore , Bedford , Mass . )
Immunoblotting was performed with commercially available anti-p65 , p50 , p100 , and c-Rel antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and visualized by using an ECL ( enhanced chemilumines-cence ) Western blotting detection kit ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , III . )
.
RNA extraction and Northern ( RNA ) blot analysis .
Ten micrograms of total cellular RNA was electrophoresed in an agarose-formamide 0.9 % gel ( 2 h , 60 V ) , transferred overnight to a Hybond-N+ membrane ( Amersham ) by osmosis , and hybridized with *°P-labeled probes .
The IxBa ( MAD3 ) probe consisted of a 1.3-kb EcoRI-Xhol fragment of the MAD3 cDNA , the p105 probe is a 1.9-kb Psfl fragment , and the GAPDH probe is a 1.3-kb Psfl fragment .
Probes were labeled with [ a « -P ] JdCTP by using a random primer DNA labeling kit ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , Ind . )
.
[ *°S ] methionine-cysteine labeling , chase , and immunoprecipitation .
Cells ( 1.5 x 10 `` per point ) at a concentration of 2 X 10° cells per ml were incubated in preconditioned methionine- and cysteine-free medium ( ICN , Irvine , Calif. ) for 4 h in T25 flasks and then labeled with 0.5 mCi of *°S-labeled methionine and cysteine ( Translabel ; ICN ) per 10 `` cells for 2 h at 37°C .
The culture supernatant was aspirated , and 10 ml of regular medium supplemented with L-methionine and L-cysteine ( 10 mM ) was added .
Cells were incubated in this medium for different lengths of time and harvested by using lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 50 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X-100 , 2 mM EDTA , 50 mM NaF , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 10 mg of p-nitrophenyl phosphate per ml , 30 mM pyrophosphate , 10 ug of B-glycerolphosphate per ml , 2 ug of aprotinin per ml , 2 mg of leupeptin per ml , 2 mg of pepstatin per ml [ pH 7.5 ] ) .
After centrifugation , the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-IxBo antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Protein G-agarose beads ( Gibco-BRL ) were added to cach sample , the samples were incubated for 2 h at 4°C and washed , and the protein was eluted as previously described .
These cluants were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) , transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane ( Millipore ) as described above for Western blots , and visualized by autoradiography .
For calf intestinal phosphatase ( CIP ) treatment , 1.5 x 10 `` cells were [ **S ) Jme-thionine-cysteine labeled , lysed , and immunoprecipitated as described above .
Immunoprecipitates were treated with 33 U of CIP ( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo . )
or mock treated in 50 jl of 50 mM Tris HCI ( pH 8 ) -1 mM MgC ) ; at 32°C for 15 min , analyzed by SDS-PAGE , and visualized by autoradiography .
RESULTS Transient expression of LMP-1 increases NF-KB activity .
We first tested whether transient LMP-1 expression in the EBV-negative cell lines BJAB , Ly1 , and Jurkat resulted in NF-KB activation .
pcDNA-LMP-1 or its antisense control were separately cotransfected with the « B-c-lue construct and a TK-B-Gal reporter to normalize transfection efficiency .
As shown in Fig .
1A , LMP increases the luciferase expression driven by the kB concatemer , while the control plasmid does not affect the basal NF- « B-luciferase activity .
Neither LMP-1 or its antisense control plasmid modified the basal activity of the AP1-c-luc construct or of the minimal conalbumin promoter-luciferase gene .
To confirm that LMP-1 increases NF- « B activation , we next determined whether transient expression of this viral protein increases the DNA binding activity of NF- « B .
For this , LMP or its antisense control plasmid was electroporated into BJAB cells .
Eighteen hours later , cells were harvested and the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were isolated .
As shown in Fig .
1B , transfection of an antisense LMP-1 plasmid does not modify NF-kB DNA binding ( lane 1 ) , while increased NF-kB DNA binding is present in LMP-1 gene-transfected cells ( lane 2 ) .
This protein complex binding DNA is specifically competed for with an excess of unlabeled NF-KB oligonucleotide ( lane 3 ) .
No increased DNA binding was observed in 2170 HERRERO ET AL .

Transient expression of LMP-1 increases NF- « B activity .
( A ) Cotransfection of 10 `` BJAB , Ly1 , and Jurkat cells with pcDNA3-1PML ( 10 pg ) and 5 or 10 g of pecDNA3-LMP-1 and a « B-c-luc or AP1-c-luc reporter gene .
Results are expressed in luciferase ( LUC ) light units normalized to B-Gal units and are representative of three experiments .
( B ) BJAB cells ( 10 `` ) were transfected with 10 ug of pcDNA3-1PML ( lane 1 ) or pcDNA3 LMP-1 ( lane 2 ) , nuclear protein was extracted , and EMSA was performed .
NF- « B and free probe are indicated at the right .
nuclear fractions from LMP or control transfected cells when a labeled AP1 oligonucleotide was used ( data not shown ) .
Altogether , these results suggest that transient expression of the EBV LMP-1 protein results in NF- « B activation .
NF-KB activation is increased in B-cell lines stably expressing LMP-1 .
To further study in detail the mechanisms by which LMP activates NF- « B in B lymphocytes , we used three B-cell lines that stably express this viral protein : BJB3LT , BJgpt2 , and Blgptl .
We first tested whether NF- « B activity was greater in nuclear extracts from the LMP-1-positive ( BJB3LT , BJgpt2 , and BlLgptl ) than in nuclear extracts from the parental LMP-1-negative cell lines ( BJAB , BJMTLM , and BLA1 , respectively ) .
As shown in Fig .
2A , NF-kB DNA binding was greater in the nuclei of LMP-1-positive cells than in their respective LMP-1-negative controls .
The basal NF-kB DNA binding activity present in BJAB cells increases following cell stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( data not shown ) .
To confirm that the increased NF-kB DNA binding activity in BJB3LT cells is specific to NF-kB , binding to AP1 and CREB motifs was tested in the same nuclear extracts of BJAB and BjB3LT cells by EMSA using the corresponding labeled oligonucleotides .
As shown in Fig .
2A , no significant increase in AP1 DNA binding activity was observed , but a mild increase in the DNA binding to the CREB motif was found .
Each protein-DNA complex was competed for with an excess of the corresponding unlabeled oligonucleotide .
Altogether , these results confirm those obtained by transiently expressing LMP in B cells , indicating that LMP-1 activates NF-kB .
To determine whether the increased NF-kB DNA binding activity present in BJB3LT cells correlates with increased NF-B-dependent transcriptional function , the < B-c-lue reporter gene was cotransfected with a TK-B-Gal reporter gene into LMP and LMP-l-negative cell lines .
Once more , greater NF- « B activity was observed in the LMP-1-positive B cells ( BJB3LT , BLgpt1 , and BJgpt2 ) than in LMP-1-negative parental cells ( BJAB , BL41 , and BJMTLM , respectively ) ( Fig .
2B ) .

The molecular forms of NF-KB activated by LMP-1 include p65 , p50 , and p52 .
In different combinations among proteins of the Rel family , a variety of homo- and heterodimers are formed , each of which is regulated by specific IxB molecules ( reviewed in references 3 and 31 ) .
To study the mechanisms regulating LMP-1-mediated NF-kB activation , we first determined the composition of the NF-kB-like complex present in the nuclei of BJB3LT cells .
Nuclear extracts of these cells and of control BJAB cells were analyzed in EMSA using specific commercial antibodies to the different Rel protein members .
Using a labeled oligonucleotide encompassing the NF-kB binding motif , we demonstrate that the DNA-binding complexes include p65/pS50 and p52 but not c-Rel .
Antibodies to p65 , p50 , and p52 resulted in supershifts of the DNA-binding protein complex ( Fig .
3A ) .
This was not observed when anti-c-Rel antibodies were used .
We next confirmed the composition of the NF- « B nuclear complex by analyzing the steady-state protein levels of the different NF-kB subunits in both cytosolic and nuclear frac-tions , using Western immunoblotting techniques ( Fig .
3B ) .
p65 protein levels were present in the nuclear fraction of BJB3LT cells but not in that of the control BJAB cells , suggesting continuous p65 nuclear translocation in BJB3LT cells .
Steady-state levels of the precursor p105 and its proteolytic product p50 are higher in the cytosolic fraction of BJB3LT cells than in NF-kB ACTIVATION BY LMP-1 2171 that of BJAB cells .
Moreover , p50 levels are also higher in the nuclear fraction of BJB3LT cells than in that of BJAB cells .
A protein migrating faster than p105 is faintly detected in nuclear extracts of both cell types , using anti-p105 antibodies .
The origin of this protein is unknown , although we can not exclude some degree of cytosolic contamination .
Results to those similar for p105 and p50 were obtained when p100 and p52 were analyzed in BJB3LT cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
Altogether , EMSA and immunoblotting experiments indicate that LMP-1-positive cells contain increased NF- « B nuclear translocation probably secondary to the regulation of IxB molecules that target p65/p50 and p65/pS52 heterodimers such as IkxBa and/or p105/p100 .
Increased steady-state levels of p105 and p100 in BJB3LT cells suggest their increased synthesis by NF- « x B-dependent mechanisms , since both molecules are regulated by NF-KB at the transcriptional level .
IxBa phosphorylation and proteolysis are increased in LMP-1-expressing cells .
IxBa sequesters NF-kB by masking the nuclear localization signal of p65 ( 5 , 11 ) .
Posttranslational modifications of IxBa such as phosphorylation and/or proteolysis result in NF-kB and IxBa dissociation ( 4 , 6 , 7 ) .
To determine whether IxBa is selectively modified in BjB3LT cells , thus accounting for the continuous NF-kB translocation induced by LMP-1 , we addressed its phosphorylation state and proteolytic processing .
In vitro , IxBa phosphorylation is necessary for NF- « xB/IxBa dissociation ( 12 ) .
In vivo , IxBa phosphorylation is detected prior to its proteolytic degradation following cell activation by `` punctual `` stimuli ( e.g .
, LPS or tumor necrosis factor ) ( 4 , 6 , 7 ) .
However , it is unknown whether the continuous presence of LMP-1 in B cells results in persistent modifications of IxBa .
To study the phosphorylation characteristics of in LMP-1-positive and LMP cells , we first performed immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-IkBa antibodies .
IxBa immunoprecipitated from LMP-1-positive cells ( BJgpt2 , BLgpt1 , and BjJB3LT ) contained an additional , slower-migrating form of IxBa than the parenteral LMP-l-negative cells ( BJMTLM , BL41 , and BJAB , respectively ) ( Fig .
4A ) .
To determine whether this slower-migrating form of IxBa present in LMP-1-positive cells is phosphorylation dependent , BJB3LT and the control BJAB cell lines were labeled with [ *°S ) Jmethi-onine-cysteine in the presence of okadaic acid , a phosphatase inhibitor shown to sustain the phosphorylated state of IxBa following punctual stimuli ( 39 ) .
Cells were then harvested , IxBa was immunoprecipitated in a lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors and competitors , and the samples were treated with CIP .
Results from these experiments ( Fig .
4B ) indicate that increased levels of *°S-IxBa are present in BjB3LT cells ( compare lane 3 with lane 1 ) and that a slower-migrating form of IxBa is immunoprecipitated with anti-IxBa antibodies in BJB3LT cells but not in BJAB cells ( lane 3 ) .
This slower-migrating form reverts into the faster-migrating complex upon CIP treatment ( lane 4 ) .
These results indicate that IxBa becomes phosphorylated in BJB3LT cells , which probably renders the molecule susceptible to subsequent proteolysis .
The latter possibiligy is partially supported by the fact that increased levels of *°S-IxBa but not of steady-state protein are observed in the same experiment ( compare lanes 5 to 8 with lanes 1 to 4 ) .
To confirm increased proteolysis of IxBa in LMP-1-expressing cells , a *°S pulse-chase labeling experiment was performed .
A 2-h pulse again demonstrates higher *°S levels of IxBa in BjB3LT cells than in BJAB cells ( Fig .
4C , lanes 1 and 4 ) .

IxBa « is phosphorylated and its synthesis and proteolysis are increased in LMP-1-transfected cells .
( A ) Immunoprecipitates of IxBa from LMP-1-positive cells ( BJgpt2 , BLgpt-1 , and BJB3LT ) and their parental control cells ( BJMTLM , BL41 , and BJAB , respectively ) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE , transferred to Immobilon membranes , and immunoblotted with anti-IxBa antibodies , using ECL ( Amersham ) .

lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The half-lives of IxBa were calculated to be 70 and 100 min for BJB3LT and BJAB cells , respectively ( Fig .
4C ) .
These results indicate that increased IxBa synthesis is followed by increased degradation ( probably secondary to a qualitative phosphorylation modification ) in LMP-1-positive cells .
This results in similar steady-state levels of IxBa in the two cell lines .
Increased transcriptional activity of p105 and IKBa ( MAD3 ) in LMP-1-expressing cells .
p105 and IxBa are tran-scriptionally regulated by NF-kB ( 22 , 40 ) .
This mechanism compensates for their usage during the activation cycle of NF-kB ( 37 ) .
To study whether the regulatory loop between NF-kB , p105 , and IxBa is present in BJB3LT cells , Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA from these and control cells ( BJAB ) was performed with p105 and IxBa ( MAD3 ) probes .
As shown in Fig .
5A , increased steady-state levels of both p105 and IxBa are present in BJB3LT cells .
To confirm that the increased IxBa RNA level is secondary to an increased transcriptional activity of the enhancer-promoter gene , transfec- J. ViroL .
tion of the wild-type MAD3 enhancer-promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene ( MAD3 luc ) or a MAD3 enhancer-promoter luciferase gene lacking the NF-kB binding motif was performed .
Luciferase activity of MAD3 luc is greater in BJB3LT cells than in parental BJAB cells .
Deletion of the « B motif within the enhancer region significantly reduces the luciferase activity , suggesting that its increased transcriptional activity in BJ [ B3LT cells is NF-kB dependent .
p105 transcription regulation is also NF-kB dependent ( 40 ) .
To confirm that increased p105 protein levels and RNA present in LMP-1-positive cells was due to increased transcription of the p105 enhancer-promoter region , a luciferase construct containing this regulatory region was cotransfected with a TK-B-Gal reporter gene into BJAB and BjB3LT cells .
As shown in Fig .
5B , the transcriptional activity of the promoter-enhancer region of p105 is also upregulated in the LMP-1-positive cells , BjB3LT .
Because both p105 and the related protein p100 have IxB-like functions and when processed by proteolytic mechanisms yield p50 and p52 , respectively , we determined whether this processing was increased in LMP -1-positive cells .
In pulse-chase methionine-cysteine labeling experiments followed by immunoprecipitation of p105/p50 and p100/p52 , we determined that the half-lives of both precursors and the proteolytic processing into p50 and p52 were the same in LMP-1-positive and control ( LMP-1-negative ) cells despite increased synthesis of both p105 and p100 in LMP-l-positive cells ( data not shown ) .
Altogether , these data indicate that LMP-1 activates NF-kB at least by inducing posttranslational modifications of IxBa .
This results in a regulatory loop that involves increased NF-kB translocation , which results in increased synthesis of p105 , p100 , and IxBa in an attempt to compensate for the continuous utilization of this relevant transcription factor and its inhibitory molecule .
DISCUSSION Although the EBV LMP-1 protein is sufficient for cell transformation ( 19 , 41 ) , the exact mechanisms regulating virus-induced oncogenesis remain incompletely characterized .
Viral proteins with oncogenic capabilities other than LMP-1 such as hepatitis B virus HBx protein and HTLV-I Tax also result in NF-kB activation ( 13 , 16 , 18 , 21 , 27 , 34 , 38 ) .
In this study , we have characterized the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which LMP-1 activates NF-kB .
These results will aide future investigations to establish the role of NF-kB in LMP-1-mediated oncogenesis and activation of lymphoid genes involved in cell activation and growth regulation .
Although a large body of information is now available as to how NF- « B and related proteins interact with their respective IxB molecules , the signal transduction pathways leading to NF-kB activation in B lymphocytes remain relatively unex-plored .
To identify the signal transduction pathways activated by LMP-1 to result in NF- « B activation , we first addressed which Rel/NF- « B molecules and IxBs were selectively modified by LMP-1 .
Identification of a specific IxB as responsible for LMP-1-mediated NF- « B activation would provide a readout for studying upstream pathways leading to modification of such IxBs .
Our data indicate that LMP-1 results in the nuclear translocation of p65 in conjunction with p50 and p52 .
Because c-Rel was found to be present at equal levels in both LMP-1-negative and LMP-1-positive B-cell lines , it was inferred that this protein and its inhibitor molecule ( IxBB ? )
were not targets of LMP-1 .
Therefore , our studies focused on IxB molecules that regulate p65 such as IxBa and the precursor molecules p100 and p105 .
Results from such studies indicate that IxBa Vou .

but not p100 or p105 was selectively modified by LMP-1 .
Although little information is available as to how a chronic stim-ulus , such as persistent expression of LMP-1 , may modify IxBa to result in continuous NF- « B activation , our results suggest that LMP-1 causes continuous modifications of IxBa by at least two mechanisms : phosphorylation and proteolysis .
These two events resemble IxBa modifications induced by punctual stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor or LPS .
Similar data have recently been reported for a model of HTLV-I Tax ( 38 ) .
Although it is unknown whether IxBa phosphorylation in vivo is the triggering event resulting in its subsequent degradation , data generated from other cell models indicate that IxBa phosphorylation precedes and is required for proteolysis , even though the latter event ultimately causes NF-kB release ( 352 ) .
Studies are currently under way to test this sequential mechanism in LMP-1-positive cells .
Nevertheless , identification of IxBa phosphorylation mediated by LMP-1 as a key event in NF- « B regulation is a first step in identifying the signal transduction pathways triggered by LMP-1 and provides a first example of how a viral protein may result in continuous modification of IxBa .
We hypothesize that phosphorylated IxBa becomes susceptible to degradation , which would explain the increased NF- « B translocation observed in our model .
The B lymphocyte , in order to compensate for the shorter half-life of IxBa , uses the NF- « B-dependent regulatory loop to increase IxBa transcription and synthesis ; this ultimately results in a balanced steady-state level of IxBa protein .
Of interest , this situation is not observed in another model of chronic NF- « B activation such as that of persistent HIV infection in monocytes and macrophages : IxBa is selectively phosphorylated and degraded by HIV , but the monocytic cell is unable to completely compensate for IxBa utilization , thus resulting in decreased steady state levels of IxBa ( 28a ) .
For the reasons cited above , LMP-1 expressing B-lymphocyte cell lines provide a useful model for the identification of the kinase/phosphate and protease ( s ) that regulate IxBa and NF- « B activation in B lymphocytes .
Even though a large body of results was obtained for cell lines stably expressing LMP-1 , many of the observations have also been confirmed by transient expression of LMP-1 .
This fact , together with recent published reports in which multiple cell lines were tested for the ability of LMP -1 to activate NF-kB ( 34 ) , strengthens the conclusion that LMP-1 activates NF-kB and it is not due to an artifact derived from studying a specific cloned cell line in which increased NF- « B activation is a function not of LMP-1 but of intrinsic differences within such clone .
Although our results have identified IxBa as a target of LMP-1 , other IxB molecules such as p105 and p100 that also regulate the NF- « B complex could have also been selectively modified in LMP-1-expressing cells .
Our studies indicate that even though p105 and p100 are indirectly regulated by LMP -1 via NF-kB ( increased steady-state protein levels secondary to increased gene transcription ) , they do not appear to be modified in a way that results in enhanced NF-kB translocation .
The increased steady-state levels of both p105 and p100 in LMP-1-expressing B cells appears to be secondary to increased synthesis and to an increased rate proteolysis into p50 and p52 , which are similar in the two cell lines .
Even though it is unclear what direct impact LMP-1-mediated NF- « B activation has in virus-induced oncogenesis , identification of IxBa as a target of LMP-1 provides a foundation for investigating pathways upstream of IxBa that may be activated by LMP-1 .
Because NF- « B activation appears to be an early event triggered by LMP-1 , this model will potentially be useful for studying proximal second messenger-signal transduction pathways that can mediate LMP-1-induced oncogenesis .
