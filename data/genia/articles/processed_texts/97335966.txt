Thrombin Generation by Apoptotic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells By Paul D. Flynn , Christopher D. Byrne , Trevor P. Baglin , Peter L. Weissberg , and Martin R. Bennett Thrombin activation requires assembly of a prothrombinase complex of activated coagulation factors on an anionic phospholipid surface , classically provided by activated platelets .
We have previously shown that anionic phosphatidylserine is exposed by rat vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) undergoing apoptosis after serum withdrawal .
In this study , using a chromogenic assay , we have shown thrombin generation by apoptotic VSMCs expressing c-mye ( VSMC-myc ) with an area under the thrombin-generation curve ( AUC ) of 305 + 17 nmol : min/L and a peak thrombin ( PT ) of 154 + 9 nmol/L .
The thrombin-generating potential of the apoptotic VSMC-myce cells was greater than that of unactivated platelets ( P = .003 for AUC ; P = .0002 for PT ) and similar to calcium-ionophore activated platelets ( AUC of 332 + 15 nmol : min/L , P = .3 ; PT of 172 + 8 nmol/L , P= .2 ) .
Thrombin GROWING BODY OF evidence implicates thrombin in vascular disease .
Thrombin is a serine protease that specifically cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin , thereby stabilizing newly formed clot .
Thrombin directly activates platelets to adhere , aggregate , and release the contents of their « gran-ules ' and is thereby a mediator of the intravascular coagulation seen in acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina pectoris .
Other cellular effects of thrombin may enhance neointima formation , including increased vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) proliferation `` and migration , `` possibly through upregulation of tissue-type plasminogen activator and the urokinase receptor . ``
Leukocyte adhesion and diape-desis , which are thought to be important in atherogenesis , may also be enhanced by a thrombin-mediated increase in P-selectin expression©® and gap junction formation ' in endothelial cells .
Thrombin induces monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production by VSMCs® and is therefore chemotactic to monocytes . ``
Thrombin upregulates plasminogen activator thereby decreasing fibrinolysis , and en-dothelin , `` ' both of which have been associated with vascular disease .
The thrombin receptor , which mediates these cellular effects , is highly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions `` and in the neointima produced by vascular injury . ``
Fibrin , an end product of thrombin activity , has been shown within atherosclerotic plaques . ``

VSMC-mye cells maintained in serum generated less thrombin than after serum withdrawal ( P = .0002 for AUC and PT } .
VSMCs derived from human coronary atherosclerotic plaques that apoptose even in serum also generated thrombin ( AUC of 260 + 2 nmol - min/L ; PT of 128 + 4 nmol/L ) .

nase complex incorporating activated coagulation factor X on an anionic phospholipid surface , classically provided by activated platelets . ``
'' Negatively charged phospholipids , such as phosphatidylserine , are normally restricted to the inner cytoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer of the platelet membrane , but are exposed on the outer surface after activation . ``
The mechanism underlying this exposure of phosphatidylserine is incompletely understood , but is invariably accompanied by the appearance of small microparticles of membrane at the platelet surface that may be the site of assembly of the prothrombinase complex .
'* `` `` Several lines of evidence using phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipases , `` artificial phospholipid vesicles , ' `` `` * `` `` and annexin V , which specifically binds exposed phosphatidylserine , `` `` have confirmed that phosphatidylserine exposure is required for prothrombinase activity .
Recent reports have also shown that lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis lose membrane phospholipid asymmetry with consequent phosphatidylserine exposure . ``
'' We have previously described the production of rat and human VSMC cell lines stably expressing the proto-onco-gene c-myc or the adenovirus ElA gene after retrovirus-mediated gene transfer . ``
'' These VSMCs undergo repro-ducible , high rates of apoptosis after serum withdrawal , as documented by their characteristic morphology on electron microscopy and time-lapse videomicroscopy and by DNA fragmentation patterns .
We have also documented phosphatidylserine exposure in these apoptotic VSMCs using radiola-beled annexin V°* and shown that the phosphatidylserine exposure partly mediates their phagocytosis by adjacent VSMCs .
Recent studies have demonstrated that human coronary atherosclerotic plaques , which are frequently associated with areas of thrombosis , have high rates of apoptosis of both VSMCs and macrophages . ``
We have therefore investigated whether apoptotic VSMCs provide a surface for the generation of active thrombin as an additional consequence of their phosphatidylserine exposure .

Russel 's Viper Venom was obtained from Diagnostic Reagents Ltd ( Thame , Oxon , UK ) and the stock solution of 0.1 mg/ mL in immidazole buffer was diluted 1 in 60 before use .
Human recombinant annexin V was a kind gift of Dr John Tait ( University of Washington , Seattle , WA ) .
All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma .
Cell culture .
- VSMCs were isolated from thoracic aortic explants of 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats .
Normal human VSMCs were derived from the media of coronary arteries of patients undergoing transplantation for nonischemic cardiomyopathy .
Patients were from the University of Washington Medical Center transplantation program between 1987 and 1994 .
Plaque VSMCs from primary human coronary artery plaques were obtained from patients who underwent directional coronary atherectomy ( Simpson Coronary Atherocath ; Devices for Vascular Intervention Inc , Redwood City , CA ) in the cardiac catheterization laboratory of the University of Washington Medical Center between 1990 and 1992 .
Isolation of cells from these tissues and histology of the tissues of origin were as described before . ``
'' Cells were cultured in M199 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ; GIBCO BRL , Life Technologies Inc , Gaithersburg , MD ) , 20 mmol/L HEPES ( Flow , McLean , VA ) and equilibrated with 95 % air and 5 % CO ; .
Subconfluent cells were analyzed immu-nocytochemically to confirm smooth muscle cell origin ( « -actin posi-tive , vimentin-positive , von Willebrand factor-negative , desmin-neg-ative , and smooth muscle myosin-negative ) .
Cells at passage 5 were used for experiments and retrovirus infections .
Production of retrovirus-infected cell lines .
- The retrovirus constructs used to create VSMC cell lines constitutively expressing c-mye and adenovirus ElA ( 128 ) were based on the pDORneo and pBabepuro retrovirus vectors `` and contained full-length cDNAs of each species . ``
'' VSMCs were infected with retrovirus vectors as previously described .
`` * `` `` Twenty-four hours after infection , resistant cells were selected in 500 pg/mL ( rat cells ) or 750 pg/mL ( human cells ) of G418 ( Geneticin ; GIBCO ) .
Resistant cell populations were used for experiments not less than 6 weeks after infection .
Cells were maintained in medium containing antibiotics at all times .
Time-lapse videomicroscopy .
- Cells were prepared for videomicroscopy as previously described . ``
Briefly , cells were maintained in medium containing 10 % FCS , washed three times in medium containing 0 % FCS , and then cultured in this latter medium .
Flasks were gassed with 95 % air and 5 % CO , every 24 hours and sealed .
An Olympus OM-70 microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) was enclosed in a plastic environment chamber and maintained at 37°C by an external heater .
The time-lapse equipment consisted of a Sony 92D CCD camera ( Sony , Tokyo , Japan ) with a Panasonic 6730 time-lapse video recorder ( Panasonic , Osaka , Japan ) .
Films were analyzed for morphology of apoptosis and cell death rates as previously de-scribed , `` `` using an observer blind to cell type and treatment condi-tions .
Apoptotic cell death events were scored midway between the last appearance of normality and the point at which the cell became fully detached and fragmented , an interval of typically 60 to 90 minutes .
Each individual cell culture was analyzed in duplicate as a minimum ( plaque VSMCs , n = 8 ; normal coronary VSMCs , n = 8 ) .
Platelets and activated platelets .
- Blood was obtained from one of the authors ( P.D.F . )
by collection into 0.109 mol/L sodium citrate .
Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 150g for 8 minutes and the platelet count and volumes were measured using a Coulter Model STKS ( Coulter , Hialeah , FL ) .
Platelets were washed twice in buffer C ( PBS , 0.05 % human albumin , and 3 mmol/L sodium azide ) and recovered by centrifugation at 1,000g for 5 minutes .
Platelets were finally resuspended to a concentration of 375 x 10°/L , giving a final concentration of 50 X 10°/L in the thrombin generation assay .
Activation was achieved by vortexing the resus- 4379 pended platelets with a final concentration of 4 calcium ionophore A23187 and 0.5 mmol/L calcium chloride .
Apoptotic bodies .
- To generate apoptotic VSMCs , near-confluent VSMC cultures were washed three times in medium with 0 % FCS and incubated in this medium for 24 hours .
Culture flasks were tapped repeatedly to dislodge apoptotic bodies that were recovered in the supernatant medium .
The bodies were counted with a hemacytometer using a 1 in 2 dilution in 0.025 % trypan blue .
On all occa-sions , the bodies excluded trypan blue .
The apoptotic bodies were thereafter treated exactly as the platelet-rich plasma , being washed twice in buffer C , recovered by centrifugation at 1,000g for 5 minutes , and finally resuspended in buffer C at a concentration of 16.8 x 10°/L , except where otherwise stated .
The final concentration was rechecked on the hemacytometer .
This gave a concentration in the thrombin generation assay of 2.24 X 10°/L , calculated to give an equivalent surface area to 50 x 10°/L platelets .
These calculations assume an average platelet volume of 8 fL ( as confirmed on the Coulter Counter ) , an average apoptotic body radius of 5 um ( based on previous studies* `` ) , and both platelets and apoptotic bodies to be spheres .
Defibrinated plasma .
Plasma from healthy donors was pooled ( 1 L ) and defibrinated by adding 1 part reptilase to 200 parts plasma and incubating at 37°C for 10 minutes .
The fibrin clot was pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000g for 10 minutes .
The remaining plasma was filtered through sterile 0.2-um filters to remove any remaining platelet microparticles and stored at -20°C in 1-mL aliquots .
Thrombin generation assay .
| Phospholipid-dependent thrombin generation was measured using the assay as previously validated and described .
`` > * `` Briefly , 10 uL Russel 's Viper Venom was added to 200 gL defibrinated , 0.2 wm filtered plasma followed by 40 uL of the suspension of freshly prepared platelets or apoptotic bodies .
Exactly 30 seconds later , 50 gL 0.1 mol/L calcium chloride was added and the reaction was incubated at 37°C in a waterbath .
At 30-second intervals , 10-4L aliquots were removed and added to tubes containing 465 gL buffer B ( 0.05 mol/L Tris-HCI , 0.1 mol/L sodium chloride , 0.5 % bovine albumin , 20 mmol/L sodium EDTA ) and 25 pL of $ 2238 ( a chromogenic substrate specific for thrombin ) at a final concentration of 20 gmol/L .
After 4 minutes at 37°C , the reaction was stopped by the addition of 300 mL of 1 mol/L citric acid .
Three hundred microliters of the resulting solution was transferred to a microtitre well plate and the absorbance at 405 nm was read in a Titertek Multiskan MCC plate reader ( ICN Biomedicals Ltd , Thame , Oxon , UK ) .
Conversion of the results to nanomoles per liter of thrombin was calculated from a previously derived standard curve using pure human a-thrombin . ``
Hirudin and annexin V studies .
The effect of hirudin on the cleavage of $ 2238 was studied by preparing a 1.5-fold molar excess .
Hirudin ( 100 U ) was dissolved in 100 gL 0.1 mol/L calcium chloride , and 50 gL of this solution was added in place of the 0.1 mol/L calcium chloride in the thrombin generation assay .
The effect of annexin V was studied by adding 2.3 wL of a stock solution ( 217 pmol/L ) to 97.7 uL of the resuspended apoptotic bodies to give a final concentration of 5 pmol/L .
The resulting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes before the thrombin generation assay .
Thrombin generation assay for monolayers .
- The thrombin generation assay as described relies on the detachment of apoptotic bodies into the supernatant medium .
To determine thrombin generation by nonapoptotic VSMCs that do not detach required adaptation of the assay for use with monolayers .
VSMCs were grown in 6-well plates until confluent .
Cells were then gently washed and incubated at 37°C either with medium and 0 % FCS or with control medium containing 10 % FCS .

The first cells undergo these changes about 15 minutes after the removal of serum , with a stochastic recruitment of cells thereafter .
We chose an incubation period of 4 hours .
Counting of the recovered supernatant on the hemacytometer over this period showed that no apoptotic bodies had detached .
After 4 hours of incubation , the plates were transferred to a wa-terbath at 37°C .
The supernatant medium was gently removed and stored for subsequent cell counting on the hemacytometer , and each well was gently washed once with 5 mL PBS , pH 7.4 .
Twenty microliters of Russel 's Viper Venom was added to 480 uL of defibrinated 0.2-um filtered plasma , followed by 100 gL of 0.1 mol/L calcium chloride .
Thirty seconds later , this activated plasma was transferred to each well with continuous gentle swirling to ensure complete coverage of the monolayer .
At 30-second intervals , 10-uL aliquots were removed and added at 37°C to tubes containing 490 L. of the buffered chromogenic substrate $ 2238 as described above .
The chromogenic reaction was stopped after 4 minutes at 37°C by the addition of 300 L of 1 mol/L citric acid , and the absorbance was read as before .
Statistical analysis .
Results are quoted as the mean + SEM .
Comparisons between groups were performed using Student 's un-paired assuming equal variances on the untransformed data , in which a prior E-test showed similar variances , and on logarithmically transformed data elsewhere as stated .
Calculations were performed using the Microsoft Excel statistics package ( Microsoft Corp , Seattle , WA ) .
RESULTS Thrombin generation by apoptotic VSMCs .
Apoptosis was induced by serum deprivation of a rat VSMC cell line expressing human c-myc ( VSMC-myc ) , a gene product known to enhance apoptosis , and the apoptotic bodies produced over 24 hours were recovered by centrifugation .
Previous studies have shown that 78.2 % + 9.2 % of VSMC-mye cells undergo apoptosis over 24 hours after serum withdrawal , as assessed by time-lapse videomicroscopy . ``
'' ' Figure 1 shows the thrombin generation curve produced by 2.24 % 10°/L apoptotic bodies , along with the curves generated by 50 x 10°/L platelets and calcium ionophore activated platelets and buffer C alone .
These concentrations were chosen , as discussed in the Materials and Methods , to approximate the surface area of platelets and apoptotic bodies in the assay .
Thrombin generation was complete by 3 minutes , and for further statistical comparison the area under the curve to 3 minutes ( AUC ) and the peak thrombin concentration were calculated , as recorded in Table 1 .
Thrombin generation by the apoptotic bodies was significantly greater than that seen with buffer C alone ( P < .0001 for logarithmically transformed AUC and peak thrombin , two-tailed H-test ) or with platelets ( P = .003 for AUC and P = .0002 for peak thrombin , two-tailed # test ) and of similar magnitude to that seen with activated platelets ( P = .3 for AUC and P = .2 for peak thrombin , two-tailed Table 1 also shows a clear correlation between the concentration of apoptotic bodies and thrombin generation ( r = .965 for AUC and r = .978 for peak thrombin ) .
To exclude the possibility that the observed thrombin generation was restricted to rat VSMCs or VSMCs expressing c-myc , human VSMCs expressing the adenovirus gene E1A , another pro-apoptotic gene product , were also studied .

man VSMC-E1A cells ( 11.7 % + 1.2 % ) undergo apoptosis over 24 hours after serum withdrawal ( M.R.B .
, unpublished observations ) .
Both the AUC and the peak thrombin for apoptotic human VSMC-E1A cells were significantly greater than for buffer C ( P < .0001 , one-tailed t-test ) , but were significantly less than for the VSMC-myc cells in 0 % serum ( P = .04 for AUC and P = .03 for peak thrombin , two-tailed t-test ; Table 1 ) .
These results suggest that it was the process of apoptosis per se , rather than the species of origin of the VSMCs or the pro-apoptotic gene product present , that was responsible for thrombin generation .
In these experiments , thrombin generation was measured by cleavage of the chromogenic substrate $ 2238 , which may not be completely specific for thrombin .
The addition of 50 U of hirudin , which antagonizes thrombin by directly binding to the active site , reduced the AUC for apoptotic VSMC-myc cells ( 1.32 X 10°/L ) from 267.0 + 5.4 nmol - min/L to 15.2 + 0.8 nmol - min/L ( P = .0005 , one-tailed # -test ) , and the peak thrombin from 130.9 + 11.1 to 6.3 + 0.5 ( P = .001 for logarithmically transformed data , one-tailed # -test ) .
This experiment confirms that it is thrombin that is generated on the surface of the apoptotic VSMCs .

'' Apoptotic VSMC-myc cells were produced and harvested as before and resuspended to give a final concentration in the assay of 2.24 x 10°/L .
Aliquots of the apoptotic VSMC-myc cells were incubated with and without 5 pmol/L annexin V at room temperature for 30 minutes immediately before the thrombin generation assay .
Figure 2 shows that incubation with annexin V reduced the AUC from 332.7 + 5.8 nmol : - to 128.3 + 6.3 nmol « min ( n = 4 , P < .0001 , one-tailed and the peak thrombin concentration from 171.0 + 3.5 nmol/L to 69.5 + 10.7 nmol/L ( P < .0001 , one-tailed -test ) .
Annexin V had a similar effect on thrombin generation by platelets and activated platelets ( data not shown ) .
Thrombin generation by nonapoptotic VSMC-myc cells .
To determine whether the thrombin-generating capacity of the VSMC cell lines studied was dependent on apoptosis and not merely a property of transfected VSMCs , the thrombin generation assay was adapted to study nonapoptotic VSMC-myc cells growing in monolayers , as described in the Materials and Methods .
Over a 24-hour period , the rates of apoptosis were 78.2 % + 9.2 % for VSMC-myc cells in 0 % FCS and 4.6 % + 0.7 % for those in 10 % FCS . ``
Figure 3 shows that the VSMC-myc cells in 0 % medium generated significantly more thrombin than the VSMC-myc cells maintained in 10 % medium , with an AUC of 209.3 + 19.0 nmol < min/L ( n = 6 ) and 87.3 + 10.0 nmol - min/L ( n = 6 ) , respectively ( P = .0002 , one-tailed # test ) .
Peak thrombins 4381 were 93.9 + 9.8 nmol/L and 39.6 + 4.2 nmol/L , respectively ( P =.0002 for logarithmically transformed data , one-tailed t-test ) .
For wells with no coating cells , the AUC was 55.9 + 1.0 nmol + min/L and the peak thrombin was 25.1 + 0.8 nmol/L ( n = 4 ) .
These values were less than those for VSMC-myc in 10 % serum ( P = .036 for AUC and P = .028 for peak thrombin , two-tailed # test assuming unequal variances ) .
Thrombin activation is thus not simply an intrinsic property of the transfected VSMCs ; apoptosis is also required .
Effect of serum deprivation on thrombin generation .
To show that removal of serum itself did not induce phosphatidylserine exposure and thrombin generation independently of apoptosis , we induced VSMC apoptosis in the presence of serum .
We have previously shown that VSMCs derived from atherosclerotic human coronary plaques undergo a high rate of apoptosis in culture even in the presence of serum . ``
We therefore studied a human coronary plaque VSMC line expressing adenovirus E1A ( HASMC-66 E1A ) that has an apoptotic rate of 7.11 % + 0.8 % over 24 hours in 10 % serum , increasing to 73.4 % + 6.8 % on serum withdrawal ( M.R.B .
, unpublished observations ) .
Figure 4 shows that human plaque-derived VSMCs undergoing apoptosis in 10 % serum generated significantly more thrombin than buffer C alone .

- Thrombin generation by monolayers of serum-starved and serum-maintained VSMCs .
VSMC-myc cells were grown in monolayers in 6-well plates .
Once confluent , they were washed and then incubated with 0 % or 10 % serum for 4 hours .
After a second washing , the thrombin-generating reaction was performed in each well .
Curves are shown for 0 % serum ( 0 ) and 10 % serum ( ¢ ) incubated VSMCs and in the absence of cells ( O ) .
The respective AUCs were 261.2 + 2.3 nmol -min/L ( n = 4 ) and 43.8 + 3.4 nmol - min/L ( n = 8 ) , and the respective peak thrombins were 128.0 + 3.5 nmol/L and 26.3 + 2.5 nmol/L ( P < .0001 for logarithmically transformed AUC and peak thrombin ) .
The corresponding values for the bodies generated in 0 % serum were 303.1 + 26.1 nmol « min/L and 158.8 + 18.6 nmol/L ( n = 3 ) , which were not significantly different from the results obtained with bodies generated in 10 % serum , showing that the thrombin generation does not simply result from serum withdrawal .
These experiments also show that apoptotic human VSMCs derived from coronary artery plaques possess a significant thrombin-generating capacity .
DISCUSSION The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that VSMCs undergoing apoptosis could provide a surface for the assembly of a prothrombinase complex through their exposure of phosphatidylserine .
We studied VSMC cell lines derived from rat aortas and from human coronary arteries and coronary atherosclerotic plaques transfected to induce stable expression of pro-apoptotic gene products .
In these cells , reproducible and high rates of apoptosis can be in-duced , usually by the withdrawal of serum survival factors .
We found that apoptotic bodies derived from rat VSMC-myc cells by serum withdrawal generated active thrombin , as measured by cleavage of $ 2238 and inhibited by hirudin .
To assess whether the amount of thrombin generated by apoptotic bodies was physiologically relevant , platelets and FLYNN ET AL calcium ionophore-activated platelets were also studied .
Activation of platelets is known to result in phosphatidylserine exposure : collagen and thrombin together cause the exposure of 100,000 sites per platelet , and calcium ionophore A23187 causes the exposure of 200,000 sites per platelet as measured by annexin V binding . ``
'' Because platelets and apoptotic bodies differ in size , the concentrations used in the assay were adjusted in an attempt to equate the total surface area present .
Given that platelet activation is accompanied by the appearance of surface microparticles that may be the major site of phosphatidylserine exposure and the assumptions underlying the calculations , this must be regarded as an approximation at best .
We found that apoptotic VSMC-myc cells generated significantly more thrombin than unactivated platelets and a similar amount to platelets maximally activated by calcium ionophore A23187 .
The correlation between the concentration of apoptotic VSMCs and the amount of thrombin generated further suggests that the thrombin generation resulted from a specific property of the apoptotic cell membrane .
We showed that apoptotic human VSMCs expressing E1A also had a significant thrombin-generating capacity , although Thrombin ( amoL ) Time ( min ) Fig 4 .

THROMBIN GENERATION BY APOPTOTIC VSMCs less than that of rat VSMC-myc cells .
This may reflect a difference in the number of exposed phosphatidylserine sites , because we have previously shown that apoptotic rat VSMC-myc cells express twice as many annexin V binding sites as apoptotic VSMCs expressing E1A .
`` ° The reason for this difference is not clear , but may reflect differing potencies of the pro-apoptotic gene products , just as the variation in the procoagulant potency of different platelet agonists has been shown to result from a difference in phosphatidylserine ex-posure . ``
We showed that phosphatidylserine exposure was required for thrombin generation as annexin V , a protein with a very high affinity for phosphatidylserine at physio-logic calcium concentrations , significantly reduced thrombin generation by apoptotic VSMCs .
To demonstrate that apoptosis was necessary for the thrombin-generating capacity of apoptotic VSMC-myc cells and that it was not just an intrinsic feature of the transfected cells required the modification of the thrombin generation assay for use with monolayers .
The adapted assay allowed the comparison of thrombin activation by monolayers with different rates of apoptosis .
Serum-starved VSMC-myc cells generated significantly more thrombin than cells maintained in 10 % serum .
There was a small difference between the latter and the nonspecific reaction that occurred in the absence of any cells .
The relative contribution to this of the nonapoptotic VSMC-myc cells and of the small number of cells that undergo apoptosis in 10 % serum is not known .
However , it is clear that there was a large increase in thrombin-generating capacity after the induction of apoptosis by serum withdrawal .
We have shown significant thrombin production by apoptotic human coronary plaque VSMCs produced in the presence of serum , thereby excluding the possibility that serum contains some factor that inhibits cell-associated thrombin generation on cells and that serum withdrawal per se accounts for our results .
Taken together , our experiments show that VSMCs possess a significant thrombin-generating capacity when they undergo apoptosis .
To our knowledge , this is the first direct demonstration of thrombin activation by apoptotic cells .
Our data are consistent with a recent study that showed a decreased clotting time in plasma exposed to irradiated endothelial cells , nutrient-deprived HeLa cells , and a temperature-sensitive murine lymphocyte cell line undergoing apoptosis . ``
This effect was abolished by annexin V and so was also phosphatidylserine-dependent .
Thrombin generation was not measured , but our results suggest that it was thrombin production on the surface of the apoptotic cells that induced clot formation .
Ultrastructural study showed binding of the annexin V to the plasma membrane , but not to internal cellular membranes , showing that thrombin generation does not result from a loss of membrane integrity with formation of the prothrombinase complex on the internal plasma membrane .
Similarly , we showed exclusion of trypan blue by all the apoptotic cells that were studied in the thrombin generation assay .
These data do suggest that all apoptotic cells may have a thrombin-generating capacity by virtue of phosphatidylserine exposure .
Classically , apoptosis has been viewed as a mechanism of silent cell removal without signaling sequelae .
However , the experiments described here suggest 4383 that apoptotic VSMCs could provide a site for the local generation of thrombin .
The most obvious site in the vasculature for thrombin generation dependent on apoptosis is the atherosclerotic plaque .
Tissue factor activity has been documented in plaques , `` is expressed by plaque VSMCs , `` and could allow the activation of factor X and subsequent thrombin generation on an anionic phospholipid surface .
Although a number of studies have shown the presence of apoptotic VSMCs in plaques , `` `` `` `` current methodologies do not allow an accurate quantitation of their frequency , so it is not possible to extrapolate directly from our data to the situation in the arterial wall .
Nonetheless , VSMCs derived from atherosclerotic plaques maintain a high rate of apoptosis in culture `` `` and it may be relevant that we have shown significant thrombin generation in these VSMCs .
Our data allow speculation that apoptosing VSMCs provide a catalytic surface for the activation of thrombin within the atherosclerotic plaque .
This could in turn contribute to the deposition of fibrin seen in plaques , `` although the classical view has been that this results from the incorporation of mural thrombi into the plaque . ``
However , it should be noted that the very phosphatidylserine exposure that allows thrombin generation may also mediate the recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic VSMCs by other VSMCs , therefore removing exposed phosphatidylserine and limiting thrombin production . ``
'' Further work will be required to determine whether apoptotic cells in plaques do indeed provide a catalytic site for the activation of thrombin .
