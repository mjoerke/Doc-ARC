and Monica Stewart* ' 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory , University of Glasgow Veterinary School , Bearsden , Glasgow , G61 1QH , UK The Runx2 ( Cbfal , Pebp2¢A , gene was previously identified as a frequent target for transcriptional activation by proviral insertion in T-cell lymphomas of CD2-MYC transgenic mice .
We have recently shown that over-expression of the full-length , most highly expressed Runx2 isoform in the thymus perturbs T-cell development , leads to development of spontaneous lymphomas at low frequency and is strongly synergistic with Myc .
To gain further insight into the relationship of Runx2 to other lymphomagenic pathways , we tested the effect of combining the CD2-Runx2 transgene either with a Piml transgene ( Ep-Pim1l ) or with the p33 null genotype , as each of these displays independent synergy with Myc .
In both cases we observed synergistic tumour development .
However , Runx2 appeared to have a dominant effect on the tumour phenotype in each case , with most tumours conforming to the CD3* , CD8 , CD4*'~ phenotype seen in CD2-Runx2 mice .
Neonatal infection of CD2-Runx2 mice with Moloney murine leukaemia virus ( Moloney MLV ) also led to a dramatic acceleration of tumour onset .
Analysis of known Moloney MLV target genes in these lymphomas showed a high frequency of rearrangement at c-Myc or N-Myce ( 82 % ) , and a significant number at Pim ] !
or Pim2 ( 23 % ) , and at Pall/Gfil ( 18 % ) .
These results indicate that Runx2 makes a distinct contribution to T-cell lymphoma development which does not coincide with any of the oncogene complementation groups previously identified by retroviral tagging .

Keywords : Runx2 ; Chfal ; Myc ; oncogene collabora-tion ; retroviral tagging ; Runt domain Introduction Manipulation of the mouse genome can be used to model the somatic mutations found in naturally-occurring human cancers with the aims of establishing their etiological significance and determining the mechanisms by which they predispose to malignancy ( DePinho and Jacks , 1999 ) .
However , transgenic mice *Correspondence : M Stewart Received 14 July 2000 ; revised 23 October 2000 ; accepted 8 November 2000 also serve as a valuable resource for the primary identification of the genes which determine the cancer phenotype and the elucidation of the roles these genes play in normal mammalian development .
The c-Myc gene has been the subject of many of these studies , reflecting its central importance in tumours of the haemopoietic system ( Nesbit et al .
, 1999 ) .
The known mechanisms of activation of Myc include chromosomal translocation and gene amplification as well as retro-virally mediated processes such as transduction and transcriptional activation by viral promoter or enhancer insertion .
Studies on Epu-Myc transgenic mice revealed that these mice are prone to develop B-cell lymphomas and that tumour onset could be accelerated by neonatal infection with Moloney MLV .
Analysis of the sites of insertion in these clonal tumours revealed a number of common integration sites which were occupied in independent tumours and the elucidation of a series of genes which collaborate with Myc in lymphomagenesis ( Adams et al .
, 1985 ; van Lohuizen et al .
, 1991 ) .
These insertion sites could be sorted into complementation groups on the basis of their close genetic linkage ( e.g .
Blal/Bmil ; Gfi1/Eis1/Pal1/Evi5 ) or the functional relatedness of the target genes ( e.g .
Pim1 , Pim2 ) .
Individual tumours harbour an insertion at only a single locus from each complementation group , indicating that a single hit to each pathway is likely to be sufficient for lymphoma development ( Scheijen et al .
, 1997 ) .
Many of the genes identified as Myc-collaborating genes have been demonstrated to be oncogenes in their own right , predisposing to tumour development when expressed as transgenes under the control of strong tissue-specific promoters and acting in synergy with Myc when the transgenes are combined by crossing of mouse strains ( Berns et a/ .
, 1999 ) .
Moreover , retroviral infection in mice transgenic for Pim ] or Bmil leads to acceleration of tumour onset with insertional activation of c-Myc or N-Myce as frequent events ( van Lohuizen et al .
, 1989 ; Alkema et al .
, 1997 ) .
These observations support a model of lymphomagenesis involving at least three oncogenic complementation groups in which the relevant target genes are of the Myc family ( c-Myc or N-Myc ) , the Pim family ( Pim1 , Pim2 , Pim3 ) and a less well-defined third group in which the critical targets appear to be Bmil and Gfil .
Surprisingly , our studies on mice carrying a MYC transgene expressed in the T-cell lineage under the Runx2 , in vivo complementation and retroviral tagging K Blyth et al 296 control of a CD2 locus control region ( CD2-MYC ) showed that tumour onset could be accelerated by Moloney MLV but with only a low frequency of hits at the known Myc collaborating genes ( Stewart et al .
, 1993 ) .
Instead , we defined the Ti/ !
locus as a common target in a significant proportion of tumours and we have subsequently shown that these insertions activate transcription of the Runx2/Cbfal/Aml3/Pebp2 « A gene ( hereafter Runx ? )
( Stewart et al .
, 1996 , 1997 ) .
By a similar approach , Girard et al .
( 1996 ) showed that Notch1 is the preferred target for viral acceleration/ activation in their MMTVd-Myec transgenic model .
Together , these results suggest that the preferred collaborating genes for Myc vary according to target cell and host genetic background .
Moreover , a recent high throughput screen of retroviral insertion sites in myeloid leukaemias of BXH2 and AKXD recombinant inbred mice which identified many new common insertion sites in addition to known targets , indicates that this screening approach is far from exhausted ( Li et al .
, 1999 ) .
Runx2 ?
is one member of the Core Binding Factor ( CBF ) family , a set of heterodimeric regulatory proteins with vital roles in haemopoiesis and osteogen-esis .
Family members encode a protein with a conserved region of 128 amino acids called the Runt Domain , which is highly homologous to a region of the Drosophila Runt protein ( Kania et al .
, 1990 ) .
Whereas the other two members of the mammalian CBF alpha family , Runx1/Cbfa2/Ami1/Pebp ?
« B and Runx3/Cbfa3/ Aml2/Pebp2 « 4C , ( hereafter Runx1 , Runx3 ) are expressed in a wide range of haemopoietic cells , the expression of Runx2 ?
is more restricted and had been described only in T-cells and in non-lymphoid cells such as 3T3 and Buffalo rat liver cells ( Ogawa et al .
, 1993 ; Satake et al .
, 1995 ; Meyers et al .
, 1996 ) .
More recently however , we and others have shown high levels of Runx2 expression in cells of the bone forming lineages ( Stewart et a/ .
, 1997 ; Ducy et al .
, 1997 ) , an observation confirmed by gene inactivation studies which demonstrated the crucial role played by Runx2 in bone development ( Komori et al .
, 1997 ; Otto et al .
, 1997 ) .
Runxl is essential for the initiation of definitive haemopoiesis ( Okuda et al .
, 1996 ; Wang et al .
, 1996 ; North et al .
, 1999 ) .
Significantly , RUNXI/CBFA ?
and CBFB , the gene encoding the beta subunit , are frequently disrupted in several types of human leukaemia ( Look , 1997 ) .
We have shown recently that over-expression of the major full-length Runx2 isoform in the thymus perturbs T-cell development , leads to the development of spontaneous lymphomas at low frequency and is strongly synergistic with Myc ( Vaillant et al .
, 1999 ) .
In this study we have investigated the relationship of Runx2 to other lymphomagenic pathways .
We show that in addition to the strong synergy exhibited between Runx2 and Myc , Runx2 can collaborate independently with the p53 null genotype and with a Pim1 oncogene .
Retroviral infection of Runx2 transgenic mice accelerates tumour development with preferential targeting of Myc family genes , though Oncogene insertions were also found at Pim ] or Pim2 and at the Pall/Gfil locus .
Our results demonstrate that Runx2 contributes to T-cell lymphoma development in a unique manner with a dominant effect on the tumour cell lineage and phenotype .
Results Moloney MLV accelerates the development of T-cell lymphomas in CD2-Runx2 mice CD2-Runx2-G1 ( hereafter CD2-Runx2 ) transgenic mice develop T-cell lymphoma with low frequency and display strongly synergistic tumour development in crosses with MYC transgenic mice ( Vaillant et a/ .
, 1999 ) .
In view of the low spontaneous tumour rate in CD2-Runx2 mice we were interested to discover whether virus infection would accelerate tumour formation .
Newborn CD2-Runx2 mice and nontransgenic littermates were infected with Moloney MLV ( Figure 1 ) .
The presence of the transgene significantly reduced the latent period for lymphoma development in Moloney MLV-infected animals ( P < 0.001 when compared to infected littermate controls ) .
By 97 days , 100 % of CD2-Runx2 infected animals ( # =46 ) had developed thymic lymphoma in contrast to only 30 % ( 6/20 ) of infected littermate controls and O0/117 uninfected CD2-Runx2 mice .
Infected CD2-Runx2 transgenic mice presented with grossly enlarged thymus and frequent involvement of secondary lymphoid organs , particularly splenic en-largement .
Tumour cells were clonal and of T-cell origin as determined by proviral integration patterns and rearrangement of the TCR-CB and JB chain genes ( data not shown ) .

Survival curves are shown for CD2-Runx2 mice infected with Moloney-MLV ( filled circles , 1 » =46 ) , control littermate mice infected with Moloney-MLV ( empty circles , » =20 ) and uninfected CD2-Runx2 mice ( filled triangles , n=117 ) surface antigen combinations CD3/CD45SR and CD4/ CD8 was performed on cells prepared from virus-accelerated tumours .
The cells of all tumours analysed were CD3 +/CD45R- confirming their T-cell origin .
19/ 21 tumours analysed presented as a clonal population of CD4/CD8 double positive ( DP ) cells or as a clonal population of CD4CD8DP and CD8 single positive ( SP ) cells ( Table 1 ) .
The finding that Moloney-MLV accelerated Runx2-expressing tumours invariably express CD8 reflects the surface phenotype in preneo-plastic thymus from CD2-Runx2 mice which consistently show an expanded CD8* population ( Vaillant et al .
, 1999 ) , and contrasts with the more variable phenotype observed in infected littermate controls ( Lazo et al .
, 1990 ; Clark et al .
, 1993 ) .
Myc loci are the preferred integration targets in accelerated CD2-Runx2 tumours DNA was prepared from CD2-Runx2 accelerated tumours and Southern blot analysis performed to determined where Moloney MLV had integrated .
Rearrangement of the following genes/loci was assessed Table 1 Thymocytes from Moloney MLV-infected CD2-Runx2 , CD2-Runx2/p53~~- , CD2-Runx2/Eu-Pim1l and CD2-Runx2/MYC ) Eu-Pim1 mice display a consistent T-cell phenotype Genotype DN CD4* CD8* CD4*/CD8* DP `` /CD8* CD2Runx2/MLV 100 1 0 13 6 n=21 CD2 0 0 1 1 2 n=4 -/- 0 _ 0 1 0 14 n=15 CD2 0 0 0 0 4 n=4 'CD4~/CD8~ ; °CD4*/CD8 * c-Myc : $ 2 % Runx2 , in vivo complementation and retroviral tagging K Blyth et al using the indicated restriction enzymes : c-Myc , N-Myc , Gfil , Pall , Ticl , Pim2 , Dsil ( Kpnl ) , Pim1 , Bmil , Ahil , Evi5 , ( EcoRI ) , Runx1 and p53 ( EcoRV ) .
25/44 of the CD2-Runx2 tumours had integrations in the c-Myc locus , six had integrations in the N-Myc locus and five tumours had both c- and N-Myc integrations .
Therefore , in 82 % of tumours , the Moloney MLV provirus had inserted into either the c- or N-Mye loci ( Figure 2 ) .
This is a significant increase when compared to non-transgenic littermates , ( 7/18 , P < 0.002 ) .
In addition , a number of integrations were observed in the Pim1/Pim2 ( 10/44 ) and Gfil/Pall ( 8/44 ) complementation groups defined by retroviral tagging in B-cell lymphomas of Eu-Myc mice ( Berns et al .
, 1999 ) .
It is clear that more than one insertion can be detected in a significant number of tumours in both transgenic and non-transgenic cohorts ( Figure 2 ) .
These results emphasize the strong collaboration displayed by Runx2 ?
2 and Myc in T-cell lymphomagen-esis .
Furthermore , the ability of Runx2 to collaborate with genes from each of the established gene complementation groups of transformation indicates that Runx2 makes a distinct contribution to T-cell lymphoma in this system and suggests that Runx2 belongs to a novel gene complementation group .
CD2-Runx2 transgenic mice display strongly synergistic tumour development with transgenic mice and mice deficient for p53 The high frequency of viral integration in the Myc loci observed in CD2-Runx2 virus accelerated tumours and the strong synergy displayed by both CD2-Runx2/ CD2-MYC transgenic mice ( Vaillant et al .
, 1999 ) and CD2-MYC/p53 null mice ( Blyth et al .
, 1995 ) prompted us to explore the effects of Runx2 on a p53 deficient background .

36 of 44 T-cell lymphomas in the Runx2 transgenic cohort harbour integrations in the c-Myc or N-Myc loci as compared to 7 of 18 in the non-transgenic littermate controls .
Integrations were also observed in the Pim1 , 2 loci ( Runx2 transgenic , 10/44 : littermate controls , 4/18 ) and Gfl/Pall loci ( Runx2 transgenic , 8/44 : littermate controls , 6/18 ) 297 Oncogene Runx2 , in vivo complementation and retroviral tagging K Blyth et al 298 transgenic mice and then back crossing with p53~_-mice to generate a cohort of CD2-Runx2 transgenic mice on null and heterozygous ( p53~* ) back-grounds .
This breeding also generated additional littermate controls of p53w_~- and p53~* without a CD2-Runx2 transgene .
CD2-Runx2 mice develop spontaneous T-cell tumours at low frequency with extensive involvement of lymphoid tissues ( Vaillant et al .
, 1999 ) while mice deficient in p53 all succumb to a variety of tumours , including T-cell lymphoma , by 10 months ( Donehower et al .
, 1992 ; Harvey et al .
, 1993 ) .
A dramatic acceleration in the rate of tumour onset was observed in animals which were CD2-Runx2 transgene positive and homozygous null for p53 ( Figure 3a ) .

The reduced latency in the tumour development of these mice was highly significant ( P < 0.001 ) when compared to the control groups in the study .
The pathological profile in the CD2-Runx2/ p53-_~- mice differed from the CD2-Runx2 mice in that tumours were restricted almost entirely to the thymus with little or no involvement of secondary lymphoid organs .
To assess possible functional redundancy between the Runx2 oncogene and known Myc-collaborating genes in T-cell lymphomagenesis , the CD2-Runx2 mice were crossed with mice carrying the Pim ] transgene ( Eu-Pim1 , van Lohuizen et al .
, 1989 ) .
CD2-Runx2/Eu-Pim1 animals displayed a significant increase in the rate of tumour onset when compared with either CD2-Runx ?
2 ( P < 0.005 ) or Eu-Piml ( P < 0.001 ) littermate controls ( Figure 3b ) .
Seventy-six per cent ( 19/25 ) of double transgenic animals succumbed with spontaneous T-cell lymphoma by 250 days of age compared to only 23 % ( 9/40 ) of littermate mice with a CD2-Runx2 ?
transgene .
It is noteworthy that the introduction of the FVB tumour susceptible strain altered tumour incidence in mice with a CD2-Runx2 transgene from 7 to 23 % ( Vaillant et al .
, 1999 ) ( Figure 3b ) .
To exclude the possibility that modifying genes were influencing tumour incidence in CD2-Runx2/Epu-Piml double transgenic mice , all controls were strain-matched first generation littermate animals .
None of the twelve Ep-Pim1 littermates developed lymphoma within the study period .
Post mortem revealed enlargement of the thymus with extensive involvement of other lymphoid tissues including spleen , and subcutaneous and mesen-teric lymph nodes reflecting the disease spectrum of the CD2-Runx2 ?
transgenic mice .
Although the acceleration in onset of tumour formation was not as dramatic as that observed in the Moloney MLV-infected CD2-Runx2 or CD2-Runx2/p53 -- mice , this result demonstrates the ability of Runx2 to independently synergise with a Piml oncogene .
This finding was further confirmed by the generation of a cohort of 16 mice triple positive for the CD2-Runx2 , CD2-MYC and Ep-Pim1 transgenes .
These animals died significantly faster ( P < 0.05 ) than CD2-Runx2/CD2-MYC , CD2-MYC/ Epu-Pim1 or CD2-Runx2/Epu-Pim1 littermate transgenic animals ( Figure 4 ) .
Together these results clearly demonstrate that Runx ?
can act as a dominant oncogene contributing uniquely to the oncogenic process and again support the placement of Runx2 in a novel gene complementation group .
Thymic tumours from CD2-Runx2/p53 -- , CD2-Runx2/ Eu-Pim1 and CD2-Runx2/MYC/Ep-Pim1 crosses display a consistent T-cell phenotype Cells prepared from thymus were analysed by flow cytometry for the expression of cell surface antigens CD3/CD45R and CD4/CD8 .

The results of the CD4/CD8 analysis are summarised in Table 1 and Figure 5 .
Fifteen CD2-Runx2 ?
/p53-~- tumours were analysed .
All displayed a consistent CD8* , CD4-+ phenotype .
This was also observed in four CD2-Runx2/p53-* tumours ( data not shown ) and contrasts with the more variable phenotype observed in thymocytes from p53 null and p53 heterozygote tumours ( Blyth , 1996 ) .
A similar cell surface phenotype was identified in four CD2-Runx2/ Epu-Piml and four CD2-Runx2/MYC/Epu-Piml tumours analysed and contrasts with the phenotypes reported for tumours arising in CD2-MYC transgenic mice ( Stewart et al .
, 1993 ) , and in Eu-Pim1 transgenic mice which display a skew to CD4 SP thymocytes ( van Lohuizen et al .
, 1989 ) .
The transformed populations observed in all of the CD2-Runx ?
transgenic crosses reflect the skewed thymocyte phenotype reported in pre-neoplastic thymocytes prepared from CD2-Runx2 transgenic animals ( Vaillant et al .
, 1999 ) and demonstrate the dominant effect of Runx2 on the tumour cell phenotype .
Discussion Our previous studies have shown that Runx2 over-expression in the T-cell compartment predisposes to lymphoma development and is strongly synergistic with MYC ( Vaillant et al .
, 1999 ) .
This study confirms and extends these observations and shows that the gene is independently synergistic with a Piml oncogene and with the p53 null genotype .
Moloney MLV-induced lymphomas were also found to be accelerated in Runx2 transgenic mice and analysis of proviral insertion sites in these lymphomas revealed frequent hits at loci representing each of three previously established Runx2 , in vivo complementation and retroviral tagging K Blyth et al 15.0 % 73.1 % $ 0.0 % 169 % CD4 lhe = Is = he Oms ¥ CD8 Figure 5 Analysis of CD4 and CD8 surface expression of tumour cells from ( a ) CD2-Runx2 , ( b ) CD2-Runx2/p353 null , ( c ) CD2-Runx2/Eu-pim1 , ( d ) CD2-Runx2/MYC/Eu-Pim1 transgenic mice and ( e ) thymocytes from healthy non-transgenic thymus .
Data from one representative for each of the above groups of mice is shown .
Cells were labelled with PE or QR anti-CD4 and FITC anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies complementation groups ( Berns et al .
, 1999 ) .
Moreover , proviral insertions at c-Myc or N-Mye were significantly more common in tumours of Runx2 transgenic mice than in controls , suggesting that the Runx2/Mye combination confers a particular selective advantage .
Together , these results indicate that Runx2 has a novel oncogenic function with is strongly selected in the context of Myc over-expression .
Phenotypic analysis of tumours from CD2-Runx2 mice revealed a highly consistent surface phenotype which was similar to an expanded cell population seen in pre-lymphomatous transgenic mice ( Vaillant et a/ .
, 1999 ) , with cells expressing high levels of CD8 and a spectrum of CD4 levels .
Intriguingly , a similar phenotype was also seen in tumours arising in Moloney MLV infected Runx2 transgenics and in Runx2 mice crossed with Pim !
transgenic or p53 null mice .
In contrast , tumours arising in Moloney MLV infected wild-type or in p53 null mice normally show a heterogeneous range of phenotypes ( Clark et al .
, 1993 ; Lazo et al .
, 1990 ; Blyth , 1996 ) while spontaneous 299 Oncogene Runx2 , in vivo complementation and retroviral tagging K Blyth et al 300 tumours in Epu-Piml transgenic mice tend to be immature ( van Lohuizen et al .
, 1989 ) .
These results demonstrate a strongly dominant effect of Runx2 on the tumour cell phenotype .
The possibility that Runx2 directly regulates the expression of this phenotypic programme is currently under investigation .
Alterna-tively , the Runx2 oncogene may select for the transformation of cells at a specific stage in T-cell differentiation .
Indeed , preliminary experiments indicate that the increased proportion of CD8 SP cells in normal CD2-Runx2 thymocytes results from the expansion of the immature CD8 SP population ( CD4- , CD8+ , HSA* , TCR-*° cells preceding the CD4CDS® DP stage ) .
Transformation of cells from this enlarged population could lead to the phenotype presented in this report .
The over-representation of proviral insertions at c-Myce or N-Myce in Moloney MLV infected CD2-Runx2 mice is intriguing and shows a close parallel with previous observations on Epu-Piml transgenic mice in which retroviral infection leads to rapid tumour onset with a high frequency of insertion at Myc family genes ( van Lohuizen et al .
, 1989 ) .
How does this selection operate ?
It seems unlikely that the Runx2 gene directly affects the frequency of proviral insertion at Myc family genes and in accord with this view we found no evidence of an increased proviral copy number in Runx ?
transgenic tumours compared to controls .
A more plausible explanation is that cells which acquire proviral insertions at Myc genes are favoured for outgrowth in Runx2 transgenic mice .
One possibility is that over-expressed Runx2 transactivates the Moloney MLV LTR enhancer , increasing the effects of proviral insertion near a Myc family gene .
In favour of this model , the Moloney MLV LTR core enhancer contains critically important binding sites for CBF ( Zaiman et al .
, 1995 ) .
However , it should be noted that this hypothesis would not account for the powerful synergy between Myc and Runx2 transgenes when combined in the germline in the absence of the exogenous viral cofactor ( Vaillant et al .
, 1999 ) .
An alternative hypothesis is that the strong selection for insertions at Myc family genes operates by enhanced survival or growth of cells over-expressing these key genes as a result of proviral insertion .
In favour of this idea , we have noted that expression of the CD2-MYC transgene , which is normally undetectable in the thymus of prelymphomatous mice , is highly expressed when combined with a CD2-Runx2 gene and we have suggested that this phenomenon is due to enhanced survival of CD2-MYC expressing T-cells in vivo ( Vaillant et al .
, 1999 ) .
However , if Runx2 acts by abrogation of Myc-induced apoptosis , this would appear to be dependent on the in vivo context as we also found that Runx2 was unable to prevent apoptosis induced by a regulatable form of Myc ( CD2-MYC-ER `` ) in lines established directly from tumours ( Vaillant et al .
, 1999 ; Blyth et al .
, 2000 ) .
In a similar fashion , the critical oncogenic function of the Pim1l kinase has not been defined clearly but an anti-apoptotic role has been noted in some studies ( Lilly Oncogene and Kraft , 1997 ; Leverson et al .
, 1998 ; Lilly et al .
, 1999 ; Shirogane et al .
, 1999 ) while others have suggested that Pim1 acts to amplify Myc signalling in a pro-apoptotic manner ( Mochizuki et al .
, 1997 , 1999 ) .
Irrespective of the mechanism by which they confer selective advantage on the Myc-expressing cell , it is clear that Runx2 and Piml are not functionally redundant .
Indeed , this study shows that the genes are synergistic when combined in the germline and that proviral insertions at Pim family genes occur with similar frequency in Runx2 transgenic and control mice .
We can also conclude that Runx2 and p53 are functionally distinct Myc collaborators as Runx2 and p53 loss are powerfully synergistic in vivo .
Moloney MLV insertions were also observed at the Pall/Gfil locus in Runx2 transgenic mice .
Although a lower hit rate was evident in transgenic mice compared to controls ( 18 % vs 33 % ) this difference was not statistically significant .
These results suggest that Runx ?
is not functionally redundant with Gil , the presumptive target of insertions at these loci ( Scheijen et al .
, 1997 ) .
However , a surprising feature of this cohort was the absence of tumours with insertions at both Pim family genes and at Pa/ll/Gfil .
Only one candidate was noted out of 44 transgenic mouse tumours and this was an oligoclonal tumour in which it was clear that distinct clones carried each insertion .
In contrast , studies on Eu-Myc , Pim1 , and Lck-Gfil transgenic mice which defined three complementation groups ( Myce , Pim and Bmi/Gfi ) on the basis of their reciprocal activation pattern showed a high prevalence of tumours involving members of each group ( Scheijen et al .
, 1997 ; Schmidt et al .
, 1998 ; Berns et al .
, 1999 ) .
This pattern of complementation appears to break down in Runx2 transgenic mice where either Pim or Pal/Gfi genes are targeted in addition to Myc .
Recent evidence suggests that Myc over-expression , besides signalling proliferation , renders cells sensitive to death by multiple effector pathways .
It is widely assumed that tumours induced by Myc must acquire resistance to its apoptotic effects ( reviewed in Pren-dergast , 1999 ) .
However , this assumption is challenged by the observations that Myc-induced tumours can expand despite a high apoptotic index ( Blyth , 1996 ) and that spontaneous tumours arising in mice carrying a regulatable form of MYC retain the capacity to undergo apoptosis on MYC activation ( Blyth et al .
, 2000 ) .
A possible rationale for these apparently contradictory observations is that the resistance of tumour cells to Myc-induced apoptosis is only relative and that tumour outgrowth will occur upon inactivation or suppression of a subset of the death pathways induced by ectopic Myc expression .
According to this model , the activation of any two of the Runx , Pim or Gfil genes may be sufficient to reduce the apoptotic effects of Myc below a threshold required for tumour outgrowth .
A quantitative model of this type could account for the apparent breakdown of previously observed complementation patterns in Runx2 transgenic mice .
To test this model further , it will be important to elucidate the gene programmes perturbed by Runx2 over-expression and establish their relationship to the pathways activated by Myc and the other Myc-collaborating genes .
Materials and methods Transgenic animals The CD2-Runx2 transgenic mice were generated as described previously ( Vaillant er a/ .
, 1999 ) .
Newborn CD2-Runx2 mice and control littermates were infected with 10° infectious units of Moloney MLV clone 1A ( van Lohuizen et a/ .
, 1991 ) within 24 h of birth .
Genotypes of mice were identified by Southern blot hybridization analysis carried out on DNA extracted after tail biopsy .
CD2-Runx2 mice were bred with p53 null mice ( Donehower ert a/ .
, 1992 ) to generate transgenic mice homozygous null for the p53 tumour suppressor gene and control groups .
F1 animals heterozygous for both Pim ] and Runx2 transgenes , and littermate controls , were achieved by breeding CD2-Runx2 mice and Eu-Pim1 transgenic mice ( van Lohuizen et al .
, 1989 ) .
CD2-Runx2/CD2-MYC transgenic animals have been described previously ( Vaillant et a/ .
, 1999 ) .
Triple transgenic animals were generated by breeding CD2-MYC ( Stewart et al .
, 1993 ) and Epu-Pim1l animals with subsequent breeding of F1 double transgenics with CD2-Runx2 mice .
Animals showing signs of malaise were sacrificed and necropsied .
DNA hybridization analysis High molecular weight DNA from mouse tissues and radiolabelled DNA probes were prepared as previously References Adams JM , Harris AW , Pinkert LM , Corcoran LM , Alexander WS , Cory S , Palmiter RD and Brinster RL .

, 1991 ) ; Gfil , 1.5 kb Xbal/BamHI cDNA fragment ( Gilks et al .
, 1993 ) ; Dsil , 4 kb BamHI/EcoRI fragment corresponding to the dsi-SR probe ( Vijaya et al .
, 1987 ) ; Evi5 , cDNA probe ( Liao et al .
, 1995 ) ; Ahil , 800 bp Psil/HindIII fragment from clone p2-1 ( Poiriee et al .
, 1988 ) ; RunxI , 158 bp PCR fragment derived from the exon 1 of the RUNXI1c isoform ( Miyoshi et al .
, 1995 ) .
c-Myc rearrangements were identified using a human c-MYC exon 3 probe , ( Stewart et al .
, 1993 ) which cross hybridises with the murine c-Myc gene due to the high degree of homology between the human and murine genes .
Flow cytometry analysis Flow cytometry analysis of tumour and thymic tissue was as previously described ( Vaillant et a/ .
, 1999 ) .
