Abstract The present work has studied mechanisms responsible for induction of early growth response 1 ( FEGR-1 ) gene expression during monocytic differentiation of U-937 myeloid leukemia cells .
Differentiation of U-937 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyliphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) , an activator of the serine/threonine protein kinase C , was associated with transcriptional activation of EGR-1 promoter-reporter constructs .
The EGR-1 promoter contains six ( CArG ) motifs .
The two 5'-most distal CArG sequences conferred TPA inducibility .
In contrast , there was little effect of TPA on EGR-1 transcription in a TPA-resistant U-937 cell variant , designated TUR .
Treatment of both U-937 and TUR cells with okadaic acid , an inhibitor of serine/ threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A , was associated with induction of monocytic differentiation and EGR-1 transcription through the 5'-most CArG element .
Since these findings supported the involvement of serine/threonine protein phosphorylation in the regulation of EGR-1 expression , we studied activation of the 405 ribosomal protein S6 serine/threonine kinases , and pp90 `` * .
Although both kinases participate in regulating cell growth , there was no detectable activation of during TPA- or okadaic acid-induced monocytic differentiation .
Moreover , rapamycin , an inhibitor of pp70°** activation , had no effect on induction of EGR-1 expression .
In contrast , analysis of pp90 `` ** activity by phosphorylation of a peptide derived from $ 6 protein demonstrated stimulation of this kinase in TPA-treated U-937 , and not TUR , cells .
Okadaic acid treatment of both cell types was associated with activation of pp90 `` ** .
Since serum response factor interacts with CArG elements and is directly phosphorylated by pp90 `` * , the present findings suggest that activation of the pp90 `` ** cascade may contribute to induction of EGR-1 transcription and appearance of the differentiated monocytic phenotype .

Introduction Previous work has demonstrated that treatment of human myeloid leukemia cell lines with TPA is associated with induction of differentiation along the monocytic lineage ( 1-3 ) .
TPA activates the serine/threonine-specific PKC ( 4 ) , and thus certain insights are available regarding early signals in this process .
Other studies have demonstrated that TPA-induced differentiation of U-937 leukemia cells is accompanied by increased expression of the early growth response 1 ( EGR-1 , zif/268 , NGF-IA , Krox24 , TIS-8 ) gene ( 5-10 ) .
The finding that this gene is activated by other agents which induce monocytic differentiation of both leukemic cells and normal monocytes suggested that EGR-1 may function in transducing early nuclear signals into longer term changes in gene expression associated with the monocytic phenotype ( 11-13 ) .
Indeed , recent studies have suggested that EGR-1 is required for differentiation along the monocytic lineage ( 14 ) .
EGR-1 expression , however , is not restricted to myeloid cells .
Neuronal differentiation of PC12 rat pheo-chromocytoma cells by nerve growth factor and cardiac differentiation of the pluripotent embryonal carcinoma P1951801¥1 line are associated with increases in EGR-1 transcripts ( 10 ) .
Moreover , the EGR-1 gene is induced during mitogenic stimulation of diverse cell types , including fibro-blasts , epithelial cells , and lymphocytes ( 15 , 16 ) .
Although these findings have indicated that EGR-1 is involved in both growth and differentiation , few insights are available regarding the signaling mechanisms responsible for induction of this gene .
Recent attention has been directed toward defining cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling pathways that contribute to the regulation of immediate-early genes .
This effort has in part been focused on MAP kinases .
Several serine/threonine protein kinases have been implicated in the control of early response gene expression on the basis of their spatial distribution and temporal regulation .
These include the 405 ribosomal protein S6 kinases , designated pp90 `` ¢ and pp70°°* ( 17-20 ) .
Activation of both pp90 `` ® and pp70° `` * involves serine/threonine phosphorylation but occurs through distinct signaling pathways ( 18 , 20-22 ) .
Although the kinases responsible for activation of pp70°* `` remain un-known , the MAP kinases appear to regulate pp90 `` * `` activity ( 23 , 24 ) .
Activated MAP kinases have been shown to phosphorylate transcription factors such as Jun and Fos in vitro ( 25 , 26 ) .
Moreover , regulation of nuclear MAP kinase and pp90 `` ®* activities by growth factors is coordinated with induction of certain early response genes ( 27 ) .
These findings have suggested that MAP kinases and > The abbreviations used are : TPA , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-1 3-acetate ; PKC , protein kinase C ; EGR , early growth response ; MAP , mitogen-activated protein ; CArG , CC ( A/T ) ; GG ; SRF , serum response factor ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; SRE , serum response element ; PBS , phosphate-buffered saline ; kd , kilodalton ( s ) ; kb , kilobase ( s ) ; SDS , sodium dodecyl sulfate .

The potential role of this signaling pathway in the induction of cellular differentiation , however , is unclear .
The present studies demonstrate that activation of the EGR-1 gene during TPA-induced monocytic differentiation is mediated through serum response or CArG elements .
Previous work has demonstrated that pp90 `` ® `` directly phosphorylates SRF ( 28 ) .
Since this phosphorylation of SRF enhances the affinity and rate with which it interacts with the CArG box ( 28 ) , we asked whether pp90 `` ®® is activated during monocytic differentiation .
Using both TPA and okadaic acid , an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases PP-1 and PP-2A , we demonstrate that activation of nuclear pp90** is associated with induction of EGR-1 and the differentiated monocytic phenotype .
Results Previous work has demonstrated that treatment of human myeloid leukemia celts is associated with increased EGR-1 mRNA levels ( 6 ) .
Similar findings were obtained in the present studies with U-937 cells ( Fig .
1A ) .
Although the 3.4-kb EGR-1 transcripts were at low to undetectable levels in untreated U-937 cells , exposure to 32 nm TPA resulted in increased EGR-1 expression , which was detectable at 1 h and maximal at 3-6 h ( Fig .
1A ) .
Exposure of U-937 cells to 40 ng/ml okadaic acid was also associated with a transient induction of EGR-1 expression , which was maximal at 3-6 h ( Fig .
1A ) .
These findings were compared with the effects of TPA and okadaic acid on a U-937 cell variant , designated TUR , which was selected for resistance to TPA-induced growth inhibition and other characteristics , such as adherence , of the differentiated monocytic phenotype .
In contrast to the effects of TPA on U-937 cells , induction of EGR-1 expression was attenuated during TPA treatment of the TUR clone ( Fig .
1 B ) .
However , the finding that TUR cells respond to okadaic acid with increases in EGR-1 mRNA levels indicated that certain signaling pathways associated with induction of this gene are intact in the variant ( Fig .
1B ) .
In order to determine the mechanisms responsible for TPA-induced EGR-1 mRNA levels , we used a construct containing the EGR-1 promoter region ( positions -957 to +248 ) ligated to the CAT reporter gene ( pEGR-1P1.2 ) .
This region includes several potential regulatory elements with two Jun/ AP-1 binding sites and six CArG boxes ( Fig .
2A ) .
Exposure of pEGR-1P1.2-transfected U-937 cells to TPA was associated with a 4.5 * 1.7-fold ( mean + SD of three determinations ) increase in CAT activity compared with transfected cells not exposed to this agent ( Fig .
2B ) .
In contrast , there was no detectable induction of the minimal pE7Z0-CAT construct ( Fig .
2B ) .
Similar studies were performed with pE425 ( positions -425 to +65 ; six CArG boxes without the two AP-1 sites ) .
pF425 was somewhat more responsive to TPA than pEGR-1P1.2 , with a 7.2 * 2.1 -fold ( mean * SD of three determinations ) increase in TPA-induced CAT activity compared with that obtained with pE425 transfected , but un-treated , cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
Transfection of pE395 , which contains the five proximal CArG boxes , also conferred TPA inducibility , whereas deletion of the next CArG box ( pE359 ) resulted in little if any TPA-induced CAT activity ( Fig .
2B ) .
These findings indicated that the region encompassing the first two CArG elements mediates TPA-induced expression of the EGR-1 gene .
Similar transient expression studies were performed with TUR cells .
However , there was no detectable inducibility of the EGR-1 promoter-CAT constructs during TPA treatment of these cells .
For example , percentage conversion with pE425 was 0.16 and 0.19 in control and TPA-induced TUR cells , respectively .
In contrast , these cells responded to okadaic acid with activation of EGR-1 transcription .
Transfection of the pE425 construct demonstrated okadaic acid responsiveness with a 4.4 + 1.1-fold increase in CAT activity , whereas little inducibility by okadaic acid was observed with both pE395 and pE359 ( Fig .

One of the early responses to mitogen-induced cellular growth is the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in certain translational components such as the ribosomal S6 protein ( 29 ) .
Although activation of pp70°° `` results in the phosphorylation of S6 ( 30 ) , it is not known whether other substrates exist for this kinase .
Since previous studies have demonstrated that TPA activates pp70°° `` in quiescent 3T3 cells ( 31 ) , we used immunoblot analysis to study pp70°°* in lysates from U-937 cells .
The results demonstrate little if any change in pp70°°® levels or electrophoretic mobility following treatment with TPA ( Fig .
4A ) .
Similar findings were obtained during exposure to okadaic acid ( data not shown ) .
There was also no detectable change in pp70°°* during treatment of TUR cells with TPA or okadaic acid ( data not shown ) .
Recent studies have shown that the macrolide rapamycin specifically blocks signaling by pp70°°® ( 31-33 ) .
Consequently , we asked whether rapamycin inhibits events associated with induction of U-937 cell differentiation .
This agent had no detectable effect on TPA-induced growth arrest or adherence of U-937 cells ( data not shown } .
Moreover , rapamycin had little effect on TPA- or okadaic acid-induced EGR-1 expression ( Fig .

These findings and the absence of pp70°°® activation indicated that pp70°° `` signaling is not essential for induction of the EGR-1 gene and other characteristics of monocytic differentiation .

Extracts of U-937 cells treated with TPA were partially purified by Q Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography .
Increases in S6 peptide phosphorylation were detectable at 30 min of TPA treatment ( data not shown ) .
This activity was further purified by absorption to Mono Q anion exchange beads and then elution with a linear NaCl gradient .
The TPA-induced pp90® activity was detectable in a peak that eluted with 0.13 m NaCl ( Fig .

In contrast , there was little if any S6 peptide phosphorylation when using protein purified from uninduced U-937 cells ( Fig .

Immunoblot analysis of the Mono Q eluate with the antiserum revealed a major species at approximately 90 kilo-daltons in the active fractions ( Fig .

Similar findings were obtained in okadaic acid-treated U-937 cells .
Treatment with okadaic acid was associated with an increase in pp90 `` `` activity compared to that in control cells ( Fig .

In contrast , assays of activation in TUR cells revealed a different pattern .
Treatment of TUR cells with TPA had no detectable effect on pp90 `` ** phosphotransferase activity , whereas phosphorylation of S6 peptide was stimulated after adding okadaic acid ( Fig .

These findings and the results obtained with U-937 cells indicated that activation is associated with induction of EGR-1 expression and monocytic differentiation .

monocytes ( 6 , 13 ) .
More importantly , recent work has demonstrated that EGR-1 expression is required for induction of monocytic differentiation ( 14 ) .
In the present studies , TPA induced little EGR-1 expression in TUR cells , whereas okadaic acid treatment was associated with induction of this gene .
Okadaic acid is an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases ( 37-39 ) and in earlier studies was found to induce monocytic differentiation of U-937 cells ( 40 ) .
Treatment of TUR cells with okadaic acid was also associated with growth arrest and the appearance of a differentiated monocytic phenotype ( 36 ) .
These findings indicated that signaling events associated with induction of the EGR-1 gene and monocytic differentiation are regulated at least in part by serine/threonine protein phosphorylation .
Several serine/threonine protein kinases have been identified that participate in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation .
TPA activates the serine/threonine-specific PKC ( 4 ) , and thus this kinase functions in initial signals that contribute to monocytic differentiation .
However , studies with the TPA-resistant TUR clone suggest that other events , potentially downstream of PKC , can be activated by okadaic acid and thereby induce a monocytic phenotype .
Indeed , characterization of the TUR variant has demonstrated decreased levels of PKC isoforms ( 36 ) .
Similar decreases in PKC expression have been reported for TPA-resistant HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells ( 41 , 42 ) .
The present studies have therefore focused on two other serine/threonine protein kinases , pp70°°® and pp90 `` ® , that phosphorylate the 408 ribosomal S6 protein .
Previous work has shown that mitogen-induced growth is associated with phosphorylation of S6 protein ( 29 ) .
TPA-induced mitogenesis of quiescent cells is associated with activation of pp70°°¢ ( 31 ) .
Moreover , selective inhibition of pp70°° `` with rapamycin blocks interleukin 2-induced entry of T-cells into S phase ( 32 ) .
Of interest , TPA treatment of U-937 cells had no detectable effect on pp70°®* .
Furthermore , rapamycin , an inhibitor of pp70°°® , failed to block TPA-induced EGR-1 expression and appearance of the monocytic phenotype .
The finding that okadaic acid treatment of both U-937 and TUR cells has no effect on this kinase also supported the lack of involvement of pp70°°K in monocytic differentiation .
Thus , pp70°° would appear to be activated during mitogenesis , but not differentiation of certain cell types .
Although also phosphorylates S6 protein , this ki-nase , in contrast to pp70°°® , exhibits phosphotransferase activity toward a variety of other substrates .
For example , activated pp90 `` ® and its homologues phosphorylate MAP2 ( 31 ) , c-fos ( 27 ) , histone H3 ( 27 ) , lamin C ( 43 ) , and glycogen synthase ( 44 ) .
Previous studies have demonstrated that the pp90 `` ®* signaling cascade transduces growth-regulatory signals to the nucleus , whereas less is known about the role of this kinase in the induction of differentiation .
The present results demonstrate that pp90 `` ® is also activated during monocytic differentiation .
TPA treatment of U-937 cells , but not the TUR variant , was associated with activation of pp90'® as determined by increased phosphorylation of S6 peptide .
Activation of pp90 `` ** was also found during okadaic acid-induced differentiation of both U-937 and TUR cells .
Although the mechanisms responsible for this activation of pp90 `` ® in these TPA- and okadaic acid-treated cells have not been defined in the present studies , previous work has shown that pp90 `` ® `` is activated by MAP kinase ( 23 , 24 ) .
Moreover , MAP kinase and pp90 `` `` exhibit coordinate temporal regulation and spatial distribution following addition of growth factors to serum-deprived cells ( 27 ) .
Other studies have demonstrated that MAP kinase is activated in TPA-induced U-937 cells ( 26 ) , and we have obtained similar findings in okadaic acid-treated U-937 and TUR cells ( data not shown ) .
Stimulation of MAP kinase activity was detectable at low levels in TPA-treated TUR cells and was less pronounced than that obtained with okadaic acid or during induction of U-937 cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , activation of MAP kinase may be responsible for stimulation of activity during both mitogenesis and induction of monocytic differentiation .
Certain insights are available regarding the relationship between activation of the MAP kinase/pp90 `` ® `` signaling cascade and induction of early response gene expression .
MAP kinase phosphorylates c-Jun and thereby may contribute to Jun/AP-1-mediated activation of c-jun gene transcription ( 26 ) .
pp90 `` ** phosphorylates a COOH-terminal serine in c-Fos which is necessary for transcriptional transrepression of the c-fos promoter ( 27 , 45 ) .
This COOH-terminal region of c-Fos is also required for down-regulation of EGR-1 gene transcription after mitogenic stimulation ( 46 ) .
The target for this repression is the SRE or CArG box ( 46 ) .
pp90 `` * `` phosphorylates SRF in vitro at the same site ( serine 103 ) that is phosphorylated in vivo after growth factor stimulation ( 28 ) .
Since SRF also interacts with the SRE ( 47 , 48 ) , and phosphorylation at serine 103 enhances the affinity of SRF binding to the SRE ( 28 ) , pp90 `` ¢ may coordinate the transcription of genes regulated by this element .
Other studies have demonstrated that the SRE interacts with both SRF and p62 `` , and that phosphorylation of p62 `` by MAP kinase stimulates formation of this ternary complex ( 49 ) .
The present work demonstrates that TPA-induced EGR-1 gene transcription in U-937 cells is conferred by the region of the EGR-1 promoter containing the first and second CArG elements .
In contrast , there was no detectable activation of EGR-1 promoter-reporter constructs in TPA-treated TUR cells .
Moreover , as previously demonstrated in okadaic acid-treated U-937 cells ( 13 ) , the present work shows that the first CArG element confers okadaic acid inducibility of EGR-1 transcription in TUR cells .
The findings thus suggest that activation of the MAP kinase/pp90 `` *® cascade may contribute to induction of EGR-1 transcription through phosphorylation of serum response factor and p62 `` .
Direct support for this mechanism would be provided by increased binding of these factors to the proximal CArG sites in the EGR-1 promoter .
However , 263 264 Induction of EGR-1 Gene Transcription we have been unable thus far to demonstrate a significant and reproducible shift in electrophoretic mobility patterns using the proximal CArG box and nuclear proteins from induced U-937 cells .
Finally , although MAP kinase/pp90* activation and EGR-1 induction have been associated with mitogenesis , the present findings support the involvement of these signaling pathways in the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells .

U-937 cells ( 50 ) and a TPA-unresponsive U-937 variant , designated TUR ( 36 ) , were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin , 100 pg/ml streptomycin , and 2 mm i-glutamine .
Cells were exposed to 32 nm TPA ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) , 40 ng/ml okadaic acid ( Moana Bioproducts , Honolulu , H1 } , and 80 nm rapamycin ( Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , MD ) .

Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer ( 1 mm - ethyleneglycol - bis ( B-aminoethyl - ether ) -N , N , N ' , N'-tetraacetic acid , 1 mm EDTA , 10 mm B-glycerophosphate , 1 mm sodium orthovanadate , 2 mm MgCl , , 10 mm KCl , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 40 ug/ml phenylmethylsulfony !
fluoride , and 10 ug/m !
of both leupeptin and aprotinin ) .
The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min to allow swelling .
After Dounce homogenization of the cells ( 20-25 strokes , tight pestle A ) , the lysate was loaded onto 1 ml of 1 m sucrose in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 1,600 x g for 15 min .
The supernatant above the sucrose gradient was again centrifuged at 150,000 x g for 30 min .
The resulting soluble fraction was adjusted to 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.1 % deoxy-cholate , and 0.1 % Brij 35 and used as the cytosolic fraction .
Immunoblot Analysis .
Phosphorylation of pp70°° `` and pp90 `` ®® were performed as described ( 18 ) .
Proteins were separated in 7.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose paper .
The residual binding sites were first blocked by incubating the filter in 5 % dry milk in PBST ( PBS-0.05 % Tween 20 ) for 1 h at room temperature .
The filters were then incubated with either a rabbit anti-pp70®° `` or a rabbit anti-pp90 `` ® antiserum for 1 h with shaking .
After washing three times with PBST , the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate ( Sigma ) .
The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemilu-minescence ( ECL detection system ; Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Partial Purification of pp90 `` ** Activity .
The cytosolic fraction was applied to a Q Sepharose Fast Flow column ( 1.0 ml ; Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) .
After washing with buffer A [ 20 mm Tris-HCI ( pH 7.4 ) , 0.5 mm ethyleneglycol bis ( B-aminoethyl ether ) -N , N , N ' , N ' -tetraacetic acid , 0.5 mm EDTA , and 10 mm B-mercaptoethanol ] , proteins were eluted with 3 mi of 0.2 m NaCl-buffer A , adjusted to 0.02 m NaCl with buffer A , and applied to a Mono Q column ( HR 5/5 ; Pharmacia ) .
The column was washed with buffer A .
Protein was eluted with a linear 0.0-0.5 m NaCl-buffer A gradient .
Fractions were assayed for pp90 `` ** activity by incubation in the presence of 50 pm S6 peptide ( RRRLSSLRA ) , 20 pm [ y-2P ] JATP , 10 mm MgCl ; , and 0.4 mm dithiothreitol .
After incubation for 15 min at 30°C , 25 pl of the reaction mixture were loaded onto phosphocellulose discs ( GIBCO-BRL , Grand Island , NY ) .
The discs were washed three times with 1 % phosphoric acid and then with water before scintillation counting .
