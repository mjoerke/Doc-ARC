10 The DNA-Binding Properties of Two Heat Shock Factors , HSF1 and HSF3 , Are Induced in the Avian Erythroblast Cell Line HD6 AKIRA NAKAL , ** YOSHINORI KAWAZOE , ' MASAKO TANABE , ' KAZUHIRO NAGATA , !
AND RICHARD I. MORIMOTO® Department of Cell Biology , Chest Disease Research Institute , Kyoto University , Kyoto 606 , Japan , `` and Department of Biochemistry , Molecular Biology and Cell Biology , Northwestern University , Evanston , Illinois 602082 Received 13 February 1995/Returned for modification 27 April 1995/Accepted 6 July 1995 Avian cells express three heat shock transcription factor ( HSF ) genes corresponding to a novel factor , HSF3 , and homologs of mouse and human HSF1 and HSF2 .
Analysis of the biochemical and cell biological properties of these HSFs reveals that HSF3 has properties in common with both HSF1 and HSF2 and yet has features which are distinct from both .
HSF3 is constitutively expressed in the erythroblast cell line HD6 , the lympho-blast cell line MSB , and embryo fibroblasts , and yet its DNA-binding activity is induced only upon exposure of HD6 cells to heat shock .
Acquisition of HSF3 DNA-binding activity in HDG cells is accompanied by oligomerization from a non-DNA-binding dimer to a DNA-binding trimer , whereas the effect of heat shock on HSF1 is oligomerization of an inert monomer to a DNA-binding trimer .
Induction of HSF3 DNA-binding activity is delayed compared with that of HSF1L .
As occurs for HSF1 , heat shock leads to the translocation of HSF3 to the nucleus .
HSF3 exhibits the properties of a transcriptional activator , as judged from the stimu-latory activity of transiently overexpressed HSF3 measured by using a heat shock element-containing reporter construct and as independently assayed by the activity of a chimeric GAL4-HSF3 protein on a GALA reporter construct .
These results reveal that HSF3 is negatively regulated in avian cells and acquires DNA-binding activity in certain cells upon heat shock .
Heat shock genes are transcriptionally induced upon exposure of cells to physiological conditions , including stresses such as heat shock , heavy metals , oxidative stress , and amino acid analogs , and during nonstressful conditions such as cell growth , differentiation , and viral infections ( 27 ) .
The effects of heat shock and other stresses on heat shock gene transcription are mediated through interactions of the heat shock element ( HSE ) that is composed of at least three pentanucleotide modules ( nGAAn ) arranged as contiguous inverted repeats ( 33 ) with heat shock factor ( HSF ) , the inducible transcriptional activator that regulates the transcription of these stress-induc-ible genes ( 25 ) .
In the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis , HSF binds to HSE constitutively as a trimer and stimulates transcription upon heat shock ( 22 , 49 , 50 ) .
During deactivation of the heat shock response , the C-terminal activator domain is unmasked and becomes phos-phorylated ( 9 , 21 , 32 ) .
In contrast , HSF does not bind to the HSE under normal growth conditions in the fission yeast Schiz-osaccharomyces pombe , Drosophila melanogaster , and higher eukaryotes but acquires HSE-binding activity by oligomerization to a trimer upon exposure to stress conditions ( 17 , 29 , 50 , 57 , 58 , 61 , 62 ) .
HSF trimers exhibit cooperative interactions between adjacent and distantly spaced HSEs as measured by DNA binding studies and transcriptional activation ( 3 , 63 ) .
Recently , HSF genes from a number of eukaryotes have been cloned , thus allowing a comparative analysis to identify regulatory domains .
The HSF family includes HSF1 , HSF2 , and HSF3 in higher eukaryotes ( 31 , 35 , 39 , 42 ) .
Among the higher eukaryotes , three domains are conserved ; these domains correspond to the DNA-binding domain ( 15 , 20 , 56 , 59 ) , an amino-terminal leucine zipper which is essential for oli- * Corresponding author .

5268 gomerization ( 34 , 51 ) , and a carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper which is not present in the HSF of budding yeasts ( 12 , 16 , 31 , 35 , 39 , 40 , 42 , 54 ) .
The carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper appears to have a critical role in maintaining HSF in a non-DNA-binding state , presumably by interfering with the leucine zippers which are required for trimer formation ( 31 , 36 , 64 ) .
The carboxyl-terminal 100 amino acids of HSF1 contains the transcriptional activation domain , whose activity is negatively regulated by sequences within the central region of HSF1 ( 18 , 44 ) .
One of the major questions about heat shock gene regulation is the identity of the sensor for physiological stress .
Several lines of evidence suggest that the DNA-binding activity of HSF is regulated by the environment of the cell and may not be intrinsic .
First , alteration of the temperature at which cells are growing modulates the response to a given temperature ( 2 ) .
Second , human HSF1 transfected into Drosophila cells or into tobacco protoplasts is activated at a lower temperature than is required in human cells ( 11 , 54 ) .
One candidate as a component of the stress-sensing apparatus is the molecular chaperone hsp70 ( 13 ) .
The amount of free hsp70 correlates with the induction of HSF and the heat shock response ( 5 , 6 ) .
Consistent with this observation , overexpression of hsp70 reduces the heat shock response and accelerates the attenuation of activated HSF ( 28 ) .
Moreover , a complex of activated HSF and hsp70 can be detected during attenuation of the heat shock gene transcription ( 1 , 5 ) .
As the stable association of HSF and hsp70 without stress could be detected but not regulated by heat shock ( 37 ) , hsp70 is thought to affect its regulatory activity through transient interactions with HSF ( 26 ) .
All three avian HSFs are expressed in most cells and tissues ( 31 ) , and the DNA-binding activity of each of the three HSFs is negatively regulated in the cell .
HSF1 responds to the classical inducers of the heat shock response , whereas HSF2 is induced during hemin-induced differentiation of erythroleukemia cells and is constitutively active during early mouse development ( 4 , 30 , 38 , 47 ) .
Comparison of the DNA-binding prop Vou .
15 , 1995 erties of the three factors revealed that neither HSF3 nor HSF1 expressed in vitro had DNA-binding properties , whereas HSF2 exhibited constitutive DNA-binding activity .
Upon heat shock or treatment with a nonionic detergent , only HSF1 acquired DNA-binding activity , indicating that HSF1 and HSF3 were not identical in their regulatory properties .
These observations suggest unique roles of HSF3 ( 31 ) .
In this report , we examine the biochemical and cell biological properties of HSF3 and demonstrate that HSF3 and HSF1 DNA-binding activities are coactivated by heat shock in avian erythroblast HD6 cells and that these events are accompanied by the translocation of HSF3 into nucleus and conversion of HSF3 from a dimer to a trimer form .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid constructions .
The full-length chicken HSF1 and HSF3 cDNAs were modified by PCR mutagenesis to contain EcoRI sites ( 41 ) and ligated in frame in the pGEX-2T vector to create pGEX2T-HSF1 and pGEX2T-HSF3 , respectively ( 48 ) .
The corresponding construct containing the chicken HSF2 cDNA flanked by BemHI sites was used to create pGEX2ZT-HSF2 , which lacks the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids as a result of the location of the BemHI site .
For overexpression of chicken HSF1 , HSF2 , and HSF3 in cultured cells , the full-length cDNAs were placed under the control of the human B-actin promoter ( 19 ) .
The EcoRI fragments of pCHSF1 ( 1.8 kb ) and pCHSF2 ( 2.3 kb ) and the EcoRI-Hpal fragment of pCHSF3-14 ( 1.5 kb ) were blunt ended with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment , ligated with the BamHI linker for HSF1 or Sell linker for HSF2 and HSF3 , and inserted into the pHBAPr-l-neo expression vector , creating pHB-HSF1 , pHB-HSF2 , and pHB-HSF3 .
The chimeric GALA-HSF constructs ( pGALA-HSF1 and pGALA-HSF3 ) were generated by PCR to amplify fragments encoding residues 209 to 491 of HSF1 and residues 202 to 467 of HSF3 , using oligonucleotide primers cHSF1-4 ( 5'-GCGAATTCTTAGGACACGGTGGGGTCCIT-3 ' ) plus cHSF1-22 ( 5-GCG GAATTCCAATCCAACCGCATCCTC-3 ' ) and eHSF3-8 ( 5 % -GCGAATTCTTA CAGGCTAGAAAAATTCCA-3 `` ) plus cHSF3-31 ( 5 % -GCGGAATTCCGAGGA AATTATATTGTT-3 ' ) , respectively .
Following digestion with EcoRI , the PCR products were subcloned into pCMX-GAL4 , which contains the amino-terminal 147 amino acids corresponding to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain ( 55 ) .

Cultures of E. coli DH1 transformed with pGEX2T-HSF1 , pGEX2T-HSF2 , or pGEX2T-HSF3 were treated with 0.4 mM isopropylthio-galactopyranoside ( IPTG ) for 3 h. The cells were pelleted and suspended in 50 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 8.0 ) -2 mM EDTA-10 pg of lysozyme per ml for 20 min at room temperature .
After three cycles of freeze-thawing and sonication , the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C .
The pellets were resuspended with 50 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 8.0 ) -2 mM EDTA-1 M sucrose-100 mM NaCl and centrifuged as described above .
The pellets were resuspended with 50 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 8.0 ) -2 mM EDTA-1 % Nonidet P-40-100 mM NaCl and incubated for 1 h at 4°C .
After centrifugation , the pellets were resuspended with the same buffer containing 1 M urea without Nonidet P-40 .
The insoluble pellets were solubilized in 20 ml of buffer containing 30 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 8.0 ) , 30 mM NaCl , 8 M urea , and 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) .
These solutions were subsequently dialyzed against the same buffer containing 4 M urea ( 1 liter ) for 12 h at 4°C and then against the same buffer without urea ( 6 liters ) .
After centrifugation , the solutions were stored at -20°C .

RESULTS Three HSFs are coexpressed in avian cells .
The relative levels of HSF1 , HSF2 , and HSF3 expression in CEF and erythroblast ( HD6 ) cells were determined by Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antisera specific to each factor ( Fig .

Each HSF is expressed in both cell types .
HD6 cells contain slightly higher levels than CEF cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
The electrophoretic mobility of avian HSF1 is unaffected by heat shock , in contrast with the significant decrease in electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE due to stress-induced serine phosphorylation which was observed for murine and human HSF1 ( 24 , 38 , 52 ) .
g—ISFZS acquires DNA-binding activity upon heat shock .
In previous studies of HSF3 , DNA-binding activity was detected only upon deletion of the carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper 4 and analysis of the truncated product by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysates .

Specificity of anti-HSF3 antisera by gel shift assay of overexpressed HSFL , HSF2 , and HSF3 .
Quail fibroblasts ( QT6 cells ) transfected with an HSF1 expression vector ( lanes 2 to 5 ) , an HSF2 expression vector ( lanes 7 to 10 ) , an HSF3 expression vector ( lanes 12 to 16 ) , or an expression vector alone ( lanes 1 , 6 , and 11 ) were incubated with « HSF3y ( 0 , 0.5 , 1.0 , or 2.0 wl of 1:10-diluted serum to a final volume of 10 wl in PBS ) or preimmune serum ( 2.0 pl of 1:10-diluted serum ; lane 16 ) on ice for 20 min , and then P-labeled HSE probe was added .
These mixtures were loaded on the native 4 % polyacrylamide gel .
Lanes 11 to 16 were exposed for a longer period .
lyzed by gel mobility shift assay .
CEF and chicken T-lympho-blast ( MSB ) cells do not exhibit constitutive HSE-binding activity , indicating that the DNA-binding property of HSF3 , as for HSF1 and HSF2 , is negatively regulated .
Prior to identification of conditions that lead to activation of HSF3 in vivo , we examined whether « HSF3 could recognize the native DNA-binding form of HSF3 .
Quail fibroblasts ( QT6 cells ) were transfected with expression vectors encoding HSF1 , HSF2 , and HSF3 , respectively .
Transient overexpression of each HSF resulted in constitutive HSF DNA-binding activity for each factor , a result that is consistent with previous observations for mammalian HSF1 and HSFZ .
As shown in Fig .
3 , extracts prepared from cells transfected with the expression vectors encoding each HSF exhibited high levels of constitutive DNA-binding activity .
Addition of anti-HSF3 antibodies to extracts of cells containing the DNA-binding forms of HSF1 , HSF2 , or HSF3 detected only HSF3 DNA-binding activity in cells transfected with the HSF3 gene ( Fig .
3 , lanes 12 to 15 ) .
At the dilution of antibody used in these studies , « eHSF3 had no detectable cross-reactivity with HSF1 or HSF2 DNA-binding activity ( lanes 1 to 10 ) ; likewise , preimmune serum had no effect on HSF3 DNA-binding activity ( lane 16 ) .
These data reveal that the intrinsic negative regulation of HSF3 can be overcome by transient overexpression and that « HSF3 provides an effective reagent with which to detect HSF3 DNA-binding activity even in the presence of HSF1 and HSF2 .
Having demonstrated that « a HSF3 recognized only the HSF3-binding complexes , we next examined the HSE-binding activities in extracts from heat-shocked HD6 , MSB , and CEF cells .

HSF3 DNA-binding activity is activated in vivo upon heat shock .
( A ) Analysis of the DNA-binding activity of HSF3 in CEF , MSB , and HD6 cells .
Cells were heat shocked at 45°C for 10 and 60 min , and then whole cell extracts were prepared for gel shift assay .
After incubation of cell lysates ( 10 ug ) and eHSF3y ( 0.5 or 1.0 wl of 1:10-diluted serum to a final volume of 10 pl in PBS ) on ice for 20 min , *°P-labeled probe was added .

From these observations , we conclude that HSF3 DNA-binding activity can be activated by heat shock ; however , regulation of this activity occurs in a cell-type-specific manner .
Since HSFI1 is also expressed in HD6 cells , we examined whether both DNA-binding activities were induced .

These results reveal that HD6 cells activate the DNA-binding activities of both HSF1 and HSF3 in response to heat shock .
One of the potential questions posed by coactivation of HSF1 and HSF3 is whether the DNA-binding complexes detected by gel shift analysis contain heterotrimers of HSF1 and HSF3 .
To examine this question , we cotranslated HSF1 and HSF3 DNA transcripts in which the carboxyl-terminal zipper motif was deleted as indicated in Fig .
5A , thus resulting in expression of the constitutively active form of each factor ( data not shown and reference 30 ) .
The in vitro translation product of HSF1 contains 322 amino acids , whereas HSF3 contains 362 amino acids and is readily distinguished by SDS-PAGE ( Fig .
5B , top ) .
In vitro translation reaction mixtures containing both HSFs were subjected to immunoprecipitation with « HSF1 .
As shown in Fig .
5B ( bottom ) , HSF3 is not immunoprecipitated by e « HSF1 , which suggests that HSF1 and HSF3 do not form stable heterotrimers .
Heat shock induces the translocation of HSF3 to the nuclei of heat-shocked cells .
The subcellular distribution of HSF3 was examined in control and heat-shocked cells by using biochemical fractionation followed by Western blot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence .
Fractionation of control and heat-shocked cells into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions reveals that HSF3 in HD6 cells resides entirely in the cytoplasm of control cells ( Fig .
6A , first row ) and translocates to the nucleus within 10 min of heat shock .
Following a return to nonshock conditions ( 37°C for 2 h of recovery ) , HSF3 becomes cytoplas-mic .
The rapid heat shock-dependent reversible translocation described for HSF3 also occurs simultaneously for HSF1 in HD6 cells ( Fig .
6A , second row ) .
In contrast to the stress-dependent translocation observed for HSF3 and HSF1 , HSF2 is relatively unaffected by heat shock and remains distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Fig .
6A , third row ) ( 43 , 46 ) .
The subcellular distribution of HSF3 was also examined in CEF cells by using biochemical fractionation ( Fig .

Subcellular localization of HSF1 and HSF3 in control and heat-shocked HD6 and CEF cells .
HD6 ( A ) and CEF ( B ) were heat shocked for the indicated periods or allowed to recover ( lanes R ) at 37°C for 2 h after heat shock at 45°C for 1 h. Whole cell extracts ( WCE ) , nuclear extracts ( N ) , and cytoplasmic extracts ( C ) were prepared as described in Materials and Methods .
Each extract ( 40 pg ) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE , transferred to a nitrocellulose filter , and incubated with the respective antiserum .
HSF3 , HSF1 , HSF2 , and , as a control , cytosolic heat shock protein hsp90 were blotted .
indirect immunofluorescence ( Fig .
7 ) .
Control CEF cells exhibit diffuse cytoplasmic staining , and upon heat shock , HSF3 was primarily detected as punctate nuclear granules ( Fig .
7 ) .
The results obtained by indirect immunofluorescence are consistent with the data obtained upon biochemical fractionation of heat-shocked CEF cells , which reveals that HSF3 translocates into the nucleus upon heat shock ( Fig .
6B ) .
The oligomeric state of HSF3 is affected by heat shock .
To further characterize the biochemical properties of HSF3 , we analyzed the oligomeric state of HSF3 in extracts from control and heat-shocked HD6 and CEF cells by using gel filtration and sedimentation analysis .
The results of gel filtration on whole cell extracts from control and heat-shocked CEF or HD6 cells revealed that HSF3 in control cells has a molecular mass of 390 kDa , which is between the molecular sizes of control and heat-shocked HSF1 ( Fig .
8A and E , fractions 19 ) .
Upon heat shock , the molecular mass of HSF3 increases to 670 kDa in both cell types ( Fig .
8B and F , fractions 16 and 17 ) .
The oligomeric state of HSF1 was also examined in CEF and HD6 cells .
The molecular mass of control HSF1 is approximately 160 kDa ( Fig .
8C and G , fractions 22 and 23 ) , and following heat shock , HSF1 has a molecular mass of approximately 670 kDa ( Fig .
8D and H , fractions 15 to 17 ) ( 46 , 58 ) .
A minor population of HSF1 with a molecular mass of approximately 360 kDa is detected in both control and heat-shocked lysates of CEF cells ( Fig .
8C and D , fractions 19 ) .
Additional evidence that HSF3 undergoes oligomerization was obtained by glycerol gradient sedimentation of extracts from control and heat-shocked CEF and HD6 cells and analysis of the fractions by Western blot analysis with « HSF1 and eHSF3 ( Fig .
9 ) .
The S values were determined for control HSF3 ( 5.08 ) , heat-shocked HSF3 ( 7.98 ) , control HSF1 ( 3.08 ) , and heat-shocked HSF1 ( 7.58 ) .
These values were consistent with the dimer-to-trimer transition of HSF3 .
From these two analyses , we determined the frictional ratios ( f/f , , ) of HSF3 and HSF1 in CEF cells by assuming that HSFs would not be modified and HSF3 would be a homodimer .
The frictional ratios of HSF1 in control and heat-shocked cells were 1.81 and 2.04 , respectively , and those of HSF3 in control and heat-shocked cells were 1.92 and 1.99 , respectively .
These results indicate that HSF3 is ellipsoid before and after heat shock .
The Stokes radii were determined for control HSF3 ( 64 A ) , heat-shocked HSF3 ( 85A ) , control HSF1 ( 45A ) , and heat-shocked HSF1 ( 85 A ) .
These data are also consistent with the interpretation that HSF3 is a dimer in control cells and in a Mor .

trimeric state upon heat shock and that HSF1 is a monomer in control cells and a trimer upon heat shock .
The data on subcellular localization and oligomeric state of HSF3 in both HD6 and CEF cells reveal that heat shock leads to a translocation to the nucleus and oligomerization from an inert dimer to a trimer .
However , HSF3 DNA-binding activity is detected only in HD6 cells .
HSF3 exhibits delayed DNA-binding activation kinetics .
Our previous observations ( Fig .
4 ) on the activation of HSF3 DNA-binding activity suggested the possibility that HSF1 and HSF3 were not coordinately activated .
To further examine the kinetics of activation of the HSFs in response to heat shock , we prepared extracts from cells exposed to heat shock at 45°C for periods of up to 120 min ( Fig .
10A ) or to arsenite for periods of up to 6 h ( Fig .
10B ) .
The heat shock-induced HSE DNA-binding activity was rapidly induced and attained maximal levels within 5 to 10 min ( Fig .
10A , PI panel lane 3 ) .
The relative levels of HSF1 and HSF3 DNA-binding activities were determined by performing antibody supershift experiments .
HSF1 was rapidly induced within 2 min ( « HSF1 panel ) , whereas HSF3 DNA-binding activity ( « HSF3 panel ) was detected between 20 and 40 min .
As expected , the addition of « HSF2 did not affect the DNA-binding activity ( « HSF2 panel ) compared with the levels of HSE-binding activity in the absence of « HSF .
Additional support for the delayed kinetics of HSF3 activation was obtained by analysis of extracts of cells treated with sodium arsenite .
The difference in activation kinetics of HSF1 and HSF3 is more dramatic with this condition of chemical stress ( Fig .
10B ) .
The DNA-binding activity detected between 0.5 to 1.5 h was supershifted only by addition of « HSF1 , whereas « HSF3 generated a supershift complex after 2 to 3 h of arsenite treatment .

Oligomeric state of HSF3 and HSF1 in control and heat-shocked CEF and HD6 cells determined by gel filtration .
Whole cell extracts of CEF ( A to D ) and HD6 cells ( E to H ) with or without heat shock were prepared .
These lysates were fractionated by gel filtration with a Superdex 200 HR column ( Pharmacia ) .
Proteins of each fraction were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with specific antisera .
The predicted elution positions of monomer , dimer , and trimer forms of HSFs are indicated at the bottom .
The approximate elution positions of protein standards are indicated on the top ( 669 kDa , thyroglobulin ; 440 kDa , ferritin ; 158 kDa , aldolase ; 69 kDa , bovine serum albumin } .
was also observed as a delay in the kinetics of cytosol-to-nucleus translocation of HSF3 compared with HSF1 in arsen-ite-treated cells .
HD6 cells were treated with arsenite and fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear extracts , and the levels of HSF1 and HSF3 were estimated by Western blot analysis ( Fig .
11 ) .
Whereas HSF1 was rapidly translocated to the nu-cleus , the fraction of nucleus-localized HSF3 was delayed relative to HSF1 , a result which is consistent with the delayed kinetics of HSF3 DNA-binding activity .
DNA-binding and transcription activation properties of HSF3 .
To further characterize the transcription activation properties of HSF3 , we used in vitro footprint analysis of the recombinant protein , using the human hsp70 promoter as a substrate .
The human hsp70 promoter has been extensively studied for DNA-protein interactions by using in vivo and in vitro footprint methodologies to demonstrate that HSF1 and HSF2 exhibit related footprints with characteristic differences in the occupancy of the HSE ( 23 , 47 ) .
Using DNase I foot printing , we found that recombinant HSF3 protects a region of DNA corresponding to nucleotides -120 to -85 ( coding strand ) and -115 to -88 ( noncoding strand ) ( Fig .
12A ) .
The boundary of HSF3 interaction extends over all five pentamer-binding sites ( monomer unit is nGAAn ) , which corresponds to the same boundaries previously observed for HSF1 interaction on the heat shock element of the hsp70 gene ( Fig .
12B ) ( 23 ) .
While these studies clearly establish that HSF3 exhibits many of the DNA-binding properties of HSF1 , we have not established whether HSF3 has the activity of an activator or repressor .
Addressing this issue directly is difficult because HSF1 and HSF3 are coexpressed and coactivated by heat shock .
Consequently , the background of HSF1 activity would interfere with our ability to directly examine the in vivo transcription activation properties of HSF3 .
As an alternative ap-proach , we examined the activity of a reporter gene in cells constitutively expressing HSF3 .

of an HSE-dependent reporter construct .
We obtained independent evidence that HSF3 was a positive activator by transient transfection of a chimeric GAL4-HSF3 ( amino acids 202 to 467 ) protein .
The activity of GALA-HSF3 was measured by cotransfection with a reporter plasmid containing the GALA-binding site , and the activity was compared with that of a positive control , GALA4-HSF1 ( amino acids 209 to 491 ) ( 55 ) .
Cells cotransfected with a GALA-HSF1 expression vector and a GAL4-HSF3 expression vector exhibited 22.8- and 73.0-fold-higher luciferase activities relative to cells transfected with a GALA expression vector alone ( Fig .
13B ) .
Taken together , these data offer strong evidence that HSF3 has the properties of a transcription activator .
DISCUSSION HSF3 was originally identified as a new member of the vertebrate HSF gene family on the basis of sequence related-ness with HSF1 and HSF2 ( 31 ) .
The three distinct members of the HSF family share approximately 40 % sequence identity .
However , the organization of each HSF , in particular the relative location and amino acid sequence of the DNA-binding domain and the leucine zippers , is highly conserved .
HSF3 is ubiquitously expressed , and the DNA-binding properties are negatively regulated , presumably through intramolecular interactions involving the carboxyl-terminal zipper 4 , as has also been suggested for HSF1 ( 31 , 36 ) .
The analysis of the properties of HSF3 presented in this study reveals that it is an inert dimer and undergoes oligomerization to an active trimer form .
However , in contrast with HSF1 , acquisition of HSF3 DNA-binding activity in response to heat shock appears to be a cell-specific event .
While these studies have identified an in vivo cellular stress condition that leads to HSF3 activation , our current analysis is too limited to allow us to conclude whether the induction in HD6 cells reflects a novel form of regulation .
We are puzzled by the observation that HSF3 DNA binding is detected only in HD6 cells , as HSF3 expression is not limited to specific avian tissues and cell lines .
Activation of HSF3 DNA-binding activity is not restricted to the HD6 cell line , as we have found that the chicken B-lymphoblast cell line DT4O also induces HSF3 upon heat shock ( 53 ) .
Comparison of the effects of heat shock on HSF3 in embryo fibroblasts and HD6 cells reveals that HSF3 activity can be regulated at multiple distinct steps .

HSF3 has the activity of a positive transcriptional activator .
( A ) Increasing levels of HSF3 expression vector pHB-HSF3 ( black bar ) or HSF1 expression vector pHB-HSF1 ( gray bar ) ( amounts of DNA were adjusted to a total of 15 mg with vector DNA ) were cotransfected into CEF cells together with LSNWT ( 5 pg ) as a reporter and a construct containing human B-actin promoter upstream of a luciferase gene ( 0.5 ug ) as an internal control .
At 12 h after transfection , cells were washed with PBS and incubated for another 24 h. The CAT activities of these cell lysates were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography .
The amount of acetylated chloramphenicol was quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager .
( B ) The chimeric GALA-HSF1 and GALA-HSF3 constructs corresponding to pCMX-GAL4 ( bar 1 ) , pGAL4-HSF1 ( bar 2 ) , and pGALA-HSF3 ( bar 3 ) were cotransfected into COS7 cells together with 5 ug of reporter plasmid ptk-galp3-luc and 1 ag of pSVCAT as an internal control .
After 36 h of transfection , cell lysates were prepared and luciferase activities were assayed .
The relative levels of luciferase activity of cells cotransfected with a GAL4 DNA-binding domain expression vector were normalized to the level of cells transfected with pCMX-GALA4 , which was assigned a value of 1 .
The relative CAT activities used as internal controls were 13 , 12 , and 22 , respectively .
HSF3 and results in nuclear translocation and oligomerization .
Yet despite these events , HSF3 does not acquire DNA-binding properties in embryo fibroblasts as detected by the use of e « HSF3 to detect DNA-protein complexes containing HSF3 .
In contrast , HSF3 expressed in HD6 cells undergoes translocation and oligomerization and exhibits DNA-binding activity .
These data reveal that HSF3 DNA-binding properties can be regulated at a point following trimer formation and nuclear localization in a cell-specific manner .
It is also possible that e « HSF3 does not detect the HSF3 activated in embryo fibro-blasts .
Additional studies will be required to distinguish between these possibilities .
As to the role of HSF3 in the heat shock response of HD6 cells , our observations indicate that HSF3 has the properties of a positive activator as measured on HSE-containing reporter constructs .
These data suggest that HSF3 could enhance the transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones ; however , the data presented here do not directly address this issue because of the presence of endoge-nous HSF1 activity .
Therefore , the analysis of HSF3 as a transcriptional activator is based on an indirect approach in which the activity of a GALA-HSF3 chimeric protein is assayed by using a GALA reporter construct from additional experiments in which the overexpression of HSF3 leads to the constitutive DNA-binding activity and transactivation of an HSE-containing reporter construct .
Although it is difficult to directly compare the relative strengths of the transactivation domains of HSF3 and HSF1 , our results suggest that HSF3 may contain a more potent activation domain .
The analysis of HSF3 also reveals a biochemical property previously described for HSF2 , i.e .
, that HSF3 is an inert dimer which undergoes oligomerization to a trimer form ( 46 ) .
While the range of conditions that lead to activation of HSF2 has not been fully described , some examples include hemin-induced erythroid differentiation in human erythroleukemia cells , early murine embryogenesis , and murine spermatogenesis ( 30 , 46 ) .
These conditions are distinct from the stress-related events that lead to activation of HSF1 ; consequently , HSF1 is induced by a broad range of conditions that lead to cell stress , and HSF2 activity is unaffected by these conditions .
Thus HSF1 and HSF2 exhibit complementary roles that extend the regulatory potential of the HSF family to respond to diverse conditions of physiological and environmental cell signalling and stress .
The coactivation of HSF1 and HSF3 in HD6 cells exposed to heat shock suggests the possibility of HSF regulatory redun-dancy , perhaps to ensure that the transcriptional activation of heat shock genes is both rapidly induced and sustained at a high level in response to extreme temperatures .
In this context , it is worth noting that the optimal heat shock temperature for avian cells is 45°C , compared with 42°C for mammals .
The possibility of a complementary role for these apparently redundant HSFs is supported by the rapid kinetics of HSF1 induction followed by HSF3 induction .
This observation , together with our previous demonstration that the in vitro activation properties of HSF3 and HSF1 differ ( 31 ) , indicates that these two factors are similar and yet have distinct regulatory features as measured by acquisition of DNA-binding activity .
To establish the biological role for HSF3 , however , it will be necessary to either inactivate or substantially reduce HSF1 expression , which would allow us to demonstrate whether HSF3 is itself sufficient to activate the expression of the endo-genous heat shock genes .
