When introduced into interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) -dependent mouse pro-B lymphocytes , E2A-HLF prevents apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation , suggesting that IL-3 mediates cell survival through activation of a transcription factor whose activity can be constitutively replaced by the chimeric oncoprotein .
We considered four bZIP transcription factors as candidates for this putative IL-3-regulated factor , each of which binds avidly to the DNA consensus sequence recognized by E2A-HLF and is related to the Caenorhabditis elegans CES-2 ( cell death specification protein ) neuron-specific mediator of cell death .
The expression and binding activity of the Nfil3 protein ( also called E4bp4 ) , but not of HIf , Dbp , or Tef , was found to be regulated by IL-3 in mouse pro-B cell lines ( Baf-3 and FL5S.12 ) .
Northern blot analysis showed that Nf # /3/£E4bp4 is regulated as a `` delayed-early `` IL-3-responsive gene , requiring de novo protein synthesis .
In the absence of IL-3 , enforced expression of the human NFIL3/E4BP4 cDNA promoted the survival but not the growth of IL-3-dependent pro-B cells .
Our results implicate NFIL3/E4BP4 ( nuclear factor regulated by IL-3/adenovirus E4 promoter binding protein ) in a distinct growth factor-regulated signaling pathway that is responsible for the survival of early B-cell progenitors , and whose alteration by E2A-HLF leads to childhood B lineage leukemia .
The elimination of defective T and B lymphocyte progenitors by apoptosis has important implications for the regulation of normal development of the immune system and for malignant transformation in the leukemias and lymphomas ( 1-3 ) .
This process is greatly influenced by cytokines that act on lymphoid and hematopoietic precursors , including interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) , which supports the in vitro proliferation of multipotent stem cells as well as many progenitor cells already committed to particular lineages ( 4 ) .
When IL-3-dependent cell lines are deprived of growth factor , they not only stop proliferating but undergo apoptosis as well , indicating that IL-3 promotes cell survival by suppression of programmed cell death ( 5-7 ) .
Thus , it is important to identify the key molecules through which IL-3-generated survival signals are transduced .

2609 The EZA-HLF ( hepatic leukemia factor ) fusion protein , which drives the leukemic conversion of pro-B lymphocytes harboring a t ( 17 ; 19 ) chromosomal translocation ( 8 , 9 ) , can block apoptosis caused by IL-3 deprivation ( 10 ) , suggesting that its primary effect is on cell survival rather than cell growth .
Because of the close homology between the basic region/ leucine zipper ( bZIP ) DNA binding and dimerization domain of HLF and that of CES-2 , a neuron-specific cell-death specification protein in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , we postulated that E2A-HLF interferes with an evolutionarily conserved pathway that can have both positive and negative effects on the survival of B-lymphocyte progenitors ( 10 , 11 ) .
To explain the ability of E2A-HLF to block apoptosis resulting from IL-3 deprivation , we reasoned that it might constitutively replace the function of a transcription factor whose activation is a normal event within the signaling pathway regulated by IL-3 .
As initial candidates for this regulatory role , we selected mammalian bZIP transcription factors that are highly related to the C. elegans CES-2 protein and that bind avidly to the same DNA binding sequence .
These include members of the mammalian proline- and acidic amino acid-rich ( PAR ) subfamily of bZIP proteins : HLF ( 8 , 9 , 12-14 ) , DBP ( albumin gene promoter D-box binding protein ) ( 15 , 16 ) , and TEF ( thyrotroph embryonic factor ) ( 17 ) .
We also analyzed a related bZIP protein called E4BP4 , isolated by its ability to recognize the proximal activating transcription factor binding site of the adenovirus E4 promoter ( 18 , 19 ) , and later independently identified as NFIL3 , a protein expressed in T cells and capable of binding to a similar sequence motif in the 5 ' flanking region of the human IL-3 promoter ( 20 ) .
Here we report that murine Nfil3/EA4bp4 is regulated by IL-3 and that enforced expression of its human counterpart in IL-3-deprived cells prevents apoptosis .
Thus , this transcription factor normally regulates a pivotal step in a growth-factor responsive anti-apoptotic signaling pathway whose alteration likely contributes to human B-lineage leukemia .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Any one of several mammalian bZIP proteins could serve as a transcription factor that transduces survival signals from the IL-3 receptor and whose function is replaced by the E2A-HLF oncoprotein in leukemic pro-B cells .
As a first step in our search for such a growth-factor-regulated anti-apoptotic transcription factor , we employed a sensitive antibody-perturbed electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the HLF consensus sequence ( HLF-CS ) oligonucleotide probe .
Our analysis demonstrated that the binding activity of Nfil3/E4bp4 ( Fig .
1 ) , but not that of HIf , Dbp , or Tef ( the mammalian PAR proteins , which were undetectable ; data not shown ) , is regulated by IL-3 in growth factor-dependent murine pro-B lymphocytes [ Baf-3 ( 5 ) or FL5.12 ( 21 ) ] .
Nfil3/E4bp4 binding activity was rapidly down-regulated after IL-3 deprivation ( Fig .
14 ) , reappearing within 2-3 hr after restoration of the growth factor to the culture medium ( Fig .
1B ) , indicative of its dependence on signals transduced through the IL-3 receptor .
By contrast , the binding activity of SP1 ( 22 ) remained unchanged ( Figs .
1 4 and B ) .
Additional controls demonstrated the specificity of native and supershifted Nfil3/EA4bp4-DNA complexes , in that they were ablated by an excess of nonradiolabeled HLF-CS oligonucleotide competitor , but unaffected by an oligonucleotide with altered base pairs in the HLF consensus binding sequence ( HLF-M4 ; see ref .
12 ; data not shown ) .
Levels of the Nfil3/ EA4bp4 protein paralleled its binding activity ( Fig .
1C ) , suggesting control at the level of synthesis of a relatively short-lived protein .
To assess the effects of IL-3 on Nfil3/E4bp4 mRNA levels , we isolated the mouse cDNA , which encodes a protein highly conserved with respect to human E4BP4 ( 100 % identical in the bZIP domain and 84.4 % identical overall ) .
Northern blot analysis with this probe demonstrated that Nfil3/E4bp4 mRNA expression depends on the presence of IL-3 .
A marked decline in the levels of mRNA occurred within 2 hr of IL-3 deprivation , with maximal levels attained 1-2 hr after reintroduction of IL-3 into the medium ( Fig .
24 ) .
The increase in Nfil3/E4bp4 mRNA was delayed with respect to that of the `` immediate-early `` gene c-fos , which reached maximal levels after 15 min of treatment .
Moreover , in contrast to c-fos , the induction of Nfil3/E4bp4 by IL-3 was blocked by cycloheximide ( Fig .
2B ) .
Thus , NfHl3/E4bp4 is transcriptionally regulated as a `` delayed-early `` IL-3-responsive gene that is dependent upon de novo protein synthesis .

To test the function of NFIL3/E4BP4 , we introduced the human NFIL3/E4BP4 cDNA into FL5.12 cells using a zinc-regulated eukaryotic expression vector .
In the presence of IL-3 , NFIL3/E4BP4 binding activity was only modestly elevated after zinc treatment ( Fig .

The functional significance of NFIL3/E4BPA4 expression was demonstrated in four clones , each of which showed prolonged survival in the presence of zinc after IL-3 deprivation ( Fig .
4B ) .
In the absence of zinc , the cells underwent rapid apoptosis ( Fig .
44 ) , as did control cells regardless of zinc concentration .
While dramatic , the effects of enforced NFIL3/E4BP4 expression on survival were less potent than those previously observed for E2A-HLF when it was expressed in Baf-3 cells under the control of the same zinc-inducible vector ( 10 ) .
This appeared to be due to the fact that , after IL-3 had been removed for 48 hr , NFIL3/E4BP4 DNA binding activity in zinc-treated transfectants fell below levels detected in cells growing in medium containing IL-3 ( data not shown ) .
Further studies are needed to determine whether protein levels are affected , or whether additional posttranslational modifica-tions , such as phosphorylation ( 23 ) , are mediated in response to IL-3 and required for full activity of NFIL3/E4BP4 as a mediator of DNA binding and cell survival .
Although NFIL3/EA4BP4 has been shown to trans-activate the IL-3 promoter in T cells ( 20 ) , its effects on the survival of FL5.12 pro-B cells do not appear to be mediated through an Proc .

- Model of NFIL3/E4BP4 function in cell survival pathways and a proposed mechanism of action of the EZ2A-HLF oncoprotein in the transformation of pro-B lymphocytes .
Expression of the NFIL3/E4BP4 gene is tightly regulated by IL-3 through an undefined signal transduction pathway emanating from the ligand-activated IL-3 receptor .
The NFIL3/E4BP4 transcription factor binds to a consensus sequence in the promoter of downstream target genes , leading to trans-activation of critical survival signals .
Because HLF and NFIL3/E4BP4 can recognize the same DNA binding site , the constitutively expressed EZA-HLF oncoprotein can replace the function of the normal IL-3-regulated transcription factor , accounting for its anti-apoptotic role in leukemogenesis .
An additional prediction of the model is that the consensus binding site ( TTACGTAA ) could serve as a versatile regulatory switch , allowing other , still-to-be-identified mammalian CES-2 homologues to contribute to programmed cell death by acting as trans-repressors of this pathway .
et al .
( 24 ) found that phosphorylation of Bad on serine residues in the presence of IL-3 resulted in its binding to the 14-3-3 protein rather than plus blocking the pro-apoptotic function of Bad .
Although the precise role of IL-3 in the early stages of B lymphopoiesis is unknown , the growth factor was required to isolate clonal pro-B and pre-B cell lines ( 5 , 21 , 25 , 26 ) , and the IL-3 gene is activated in some cases of human acute pro-B cell leukemia associated with the t ( 5 ; 14 ) chromosomal translocation ( 27 , 28 ) .
The apparent leukemogenic effects of IL-3 activation in man strongly suggest that the cytokine mediates cell growth and survival in at least a subset of early B cell progenitors .
Here we provide insight into the transcriptional mechanism through which IL-3 influences progenitor cell survival during B lymphopoiesis , demonstrating that NFIL3/ EABPA4 is positively regulated by IL-3 and functions downstream of the IL-3 receptor to block the programmed cell death that results from growth factor deprivation .
The oncogenic transcription factor EZ2A-HLF , which binds the same DNA consensus sequence as NFIL3/EABP4 , also protects pro-B cells from programmed cell death ( 10 ) , suggesting that both act through a common downstream signaling pathway .
Functional studies indicate a positive regulatory role for E2A-HLF in gene expression , mediated through two separate domains ( AD1 and AD2 ) in the E2A fusion element that act as potent trans-activators of gene expression in several contexts ( 12 , 13 , 29-31 ) .
By contrast , NFIL3/E4BP4 can function as either a trans-repressor or trans-activator of transcription in different cell types and promoter contexts ( 18-20 ) .
The C. elegans cell death specification protein CES-2 is highly related to HLF and NFIL3/E4BP4 in its bZIP domain , and it binds to the same DNA consensus sequence ( 11 ) .
Genetic evidence suggests that the CES-2 protein acts as a transcriptional repressor to induce programmed cell death in the sister cells of serotoninergic neurosecretory motor neurons during C. elegans embryogenesis ( 11 , 32 ) .
Accordingly , the consensus binding sequence recognized by HLF , NFIL3/E4BP4 , and CES-2 may serve as a versatile regulatory switch in the promoter regions of target genes , either inducing ( CES-2 ) or suppressing ( NFIL3/E4BPA4 , E2A-HLF ) apoptosis , depending on site occupancy .
We therefore propose that E2A-HLF , due to its constitutive expression in pro-B cells carrying the t ( 17 ; 19 ) , replaces NFIL3/E4BP4 in a novel IL-3-dependent survival pathway , trans-activating a target gene or genes whose expression is critical for downstream anti-apoptotic signaling ( Fig .
5 ) .
As these lymphoid progenitors accumulate , they likely acquire additional mutations of growth regulatory genes needed to produce overt human B-lineage acute leukemia .
