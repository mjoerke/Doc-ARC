Department of Internal Medicine , Section on Infectious Diseases , Wake Forest University School of Medicine , Medical Center Boulevard , Winston-Salem , NC 27157 , U.S.A. STAT3 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ) is a latent transcription factor that is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation ( Tyr-705 ) in cells stimulated with cytokines or growth factors .
Recent studies suggest that one or more cyto-plasmic serine kinases also phosphorylate STAT3 and are necessary for maximal gene activation .
Here we demonstrate , with a site-specific antibody , that STAT3 is phosphorylated on Ser-727 in human neutrophils stimulated with chemotactic factors ( N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and complement CSa ) , cytokines [ granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) ] , or a protein kinase C activator ( PMA ) .
( 2-Amino-3 `` -methoxyphenyl ) oxanaphthalen-4-one ( PD 98059 ) , an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ( ERK ) activation , blocked the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by chemotactic factors or PMA .
The drug was less effective on cytokines : it virtually abolished the response to GM- CSF that occurred 5 min after stimulation but only partly decreased those at 15-30 min and did not appreciably alter responses to G-CSF regardless of incubation time .
1- ( 5-Isoquinolinylsulphonyl ) -2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride ( H7 ) , an inhibitor of a putative STAT3 serine kinase , and 4- ( 4-fluorophenyl ) -2- ( 4-methylsulphinylphenyl ) -5- ( 4-pyridyl ) 1H-imidazole ( SB 203580 ) , an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase , did not dampen any of these serine phosphorylation responses .
We propose that neutrophils use both ERK-dependent and ERK-independent pathways to phosphorylate Ser-727 on STAT3 .
The former pathway is recruited by all ERK-activating stimuli , whereas the latter pathway uses an undefined serine kinase and is recruited selectively by cytokines .
Key words : serine kinase , transcription factor , signal trans-duction .
INTRODUCTION Signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) were first identified as interferon-responsive transcription factors .
So far , seven different STATs have been identified in mammals and shown to participate in the signalling initiated by a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors [ 1-3 ] .
These transcription factors contain a Sre homology 2 domain and a C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site .
STAT proteins exist as inactive monomers in the cytoplasm .
After phosphorylation on tyrosine , they dimerize , translocate to the nucleus and bind specific DNA promoter sequences .
Recent studies have found that several STATs , including STAT3 , are also phosphorylated on serine [ 4-13 ] .
Serine phosphorylation is not an absolute requirement for transcriptional activation but might be an important modulating signal [ 4 ] .
The site of phosphorylation ( Ser-727 ) is located within a consensus sequence ( Pro-Met-Ser-Pro ) for members of the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase family .
However , the kinase ( s ) responsible for this phosphorylation as well as the precise function of these events are the subject of controversy .
Chemotactic factors , e.g .
N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine ( FMLP ) and complement CSa , stimulate human neutrophil migration , phagocytosis , granule enzyme release and super-oxide production [ 14 ] .
In contrast , cytokines such as granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) have little capacity to elicit these responses .
Rather , they greatly enhance or prime the response of neutrophils to other agents [ 15 ] .
Receptors for the two classes of stimulus similarly have contrasting structures and signal mechanisms .
For example , receptors for the chemotactic factors , but not those for the cytokines , operate through G-proteins [ 14 ] .
In spite of these differences , chemotactic factors and cytokines share an ability to activate extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases ( ERKs ) [ 16-18 ] .
However , studies have yet to establish a direct link between these kinases and neutrophil function [ 19-21 ] .
Whereas ERKs are known to activate transcription factors in numerous cell types [ 22 ] , neutrophils are terminally differentiated , non-mitotic , short-lived cells whose principal responses are largely independent of protein synthesis .
Regulation of gene expression would not be crucial to the functioning of ERK in cells with the latter characteristics .
In contrast , neutrophils do increase the transcription of chemokine , cytokine , and immediate-early genes during stimulation [ 23-25 ] .
Furthermore , recent studies find that neutrophils contain several STAT 's ( including STAT3 ) that are phosphorylated on tyrosine during challenge with GM-CSF or G-CSF [ 26-28 ] .
Here we test the notion that STAT3 is a physiological target for ERKs in human neutrophils .
We find that the serine phosphorylation of Abbreviations used : ERK , extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ; FMLP , N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine ; GM-CSF , granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor ; G-CSF , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ; H7 , 1- ( 5-isoquinolinylsulphonyl ) -2-methylpiperazine dihydro-chloride ; MAP , mitogen-activated protein ; p90 `` , 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase ; PD 98059 , ( Z-amino-3'-methoxyphenyljoxanaphthalen-4-one ; SB 203580 , 4- ( 4-fluorophenyl ) -2- ( 4-methylsulphinylphenyl ) -5- ( 4-pyridy1 ) 1H-imidazole ; STAT , signal transducer and activator of transcription .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies and reagents Phospho-specific antibodies for STAT3 and ERK were obtained from New England Biolabs ( Beverly , MA , U.S.A. ) .
Monoclonal antibodies against STAT3 and 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase ( p90 `` ** ) , and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase , were from Transduction Laboratories ( Lexington , KY , U.S.A. ) .
( 2-Amino-3'-methoxyphenyl ) oxanaphthalen-4-one ( PD 98059 ) and 4- ( 4-fluorophenyl ) -2- ( 4-methylsulphinylphenyl ) -5- ( 4-pyridyl ) 1H-imidazole ( SB 203580 ) were purchased from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA , U.S.A. ) and dissolved in DMSO .
1- ( 5-Isoquinolinylsulphonyl ) -2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride ( H7 ) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals ( San Diego , CA , U.S.A. ) and Research Biochemicals International ( Natick , MA , U.S.A. ) .
Reagents from the two sources gave comparable results .
Recombinant human GM-CSF and G-CSF were from Pepro Tech ( Rocky Hill , NJ , U.S.A. ) .
CSa and PMA were from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO , U.S.A. ) .
FMLP was from Peninsula Laboratories ( Belmont , CA , U.S.A. ) .
Preparation of cells Human neutrophils were isolated from the fresh venous blood of healthy volunteers .
Cells were suspended in a modified Hanks balanced salt solution [ 18 ] and stored on ice before use .
Immunoblotting studies Cells [ ( 2-4 ) x 105/mll were challenged at 37°C and pelleted by rapid centrifugation .
Pellets were suspended in ice-cold sample buffer [ 20 mM Tris/HCl ( pH 7.5 ) /2 mM EDTA/50 mM 2-mercaptocthanol/25 mM NaF/0.2 mM Na , VO , /2 mM di-isopropylfluorophosphate/1 mM PMSF/25 ug/ml pepstatin/ 40 ug/ml leupeptin/50 i.u./ml aprotinin ] and placed on ice for 15-30 min .
The suspensions were combined with equal volumes of 2x SDS sample buffer [ 1 x buffer : 62.5 mM Tris/HCl ( pH 6.8 ) /2 % SDS/50 mM dithiothreitol ] and immediately boiled for 5 min .
For STATs and p90 `` ** , samples were subjected to SDS/ PAGE [ 8 % ( w/v ) gell and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes .
For ERKs , samples were subjected to SDS/PAGE [ 12 % ( w/v ) gel ] and electroblotted to PVDF membranes .
Membranes were blocked with 3 % ( v/v ) non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 ( TBS-T ) [ 10 mM Tris/HCl ( pH 7.4 ) /154 mM NaC1/0.1 % ( v/v ) Tween 20 ] at room temperature for 1 h , washed in TBS-T and incubated with primary antibody ( 1:2000 dilution ) in TBS-T containing 1 % ( w/v ) BSA .
Blots were washed in TBS-T before incubation for 1 h with a secondary antibody ( 1 : 5000 dilution ) , either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG , in TBS-T containing 1.5 % ( v/v ) non-fat milk .
Blots were washed extensively with TBS-T and proteins were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system in accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL , U.S.A. ) .
Our results are representative of at least two or three experiments done on cells from different donors .
RESULTS To determine the effect of FMLP and GM-CSF on ERKs , neutrophils were stimulated with FMLP ( 1 wM ) or GM-CSF ( 500 ng/ml ) for 1-60 min .

The antibody recognizes the kinases only when phosphorylated on Thr-202 and Tyr-204 residues in their regulatory sequence .
FMLP and GM-CSF stimulated the dual phosphorylation of both ERK s but operated with different kinetics .
Responses to FMLP were rapid and transient , maximizing within 1 min and decreasing thereafter ( Figure 1 , upper panel ) .
Responses to GM-CSF developed only after 1 min , reached a maximum by 5-15 min and declined slowly over 60 min ( Figure 1 , lower panel ) .
PD 98059 inhibits ERK activation by preventing the activation of MAP kinase kinase 1 [ 29 ] .
As reported previously [ 19-21 ] , the drug ( 50 zM ) almost completely blocked FMLP- and GM-CSF -induced ERK phosphorylation regardless of duration of stimulation ( 160 min ) .
PD 98059 similarly blocked the activation of ERKs stimulated by CSa or PMA ( results not shown ) .
Importantly , however , G-CSF had relatively little ability to stimulate ERK activation ( see Figure 3 ) .
The ribosomal protein kinase p90 `` ® `` is a downstream target for the ERKs that , on phosphorylation at multiple sites , exhibits a characteristic decrease in its electrophoretic mobility on SDS/ PAGE [ 30 ] .
We used this mobility change to monitor ERK activation in vivo .
Figure 2 ( upper panel ) indicates that p90 `` appeared as a doublet in the lysates of resting neutrophils .
Challenging the cells with FMLP or CSa caused the appearance of multiple slower-moving p90 `` * `` * species .
PD 98059 blocked the formation of the latter species in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 2 , upper panel ) .
These results , when taken with those on ERK phosphorylation , establish that PD 98059 efficiently blocks the activation of ERKs in stimulated neutrophils .
We next probed for stimulus-induced changes in the disposition of STAT3 by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-STAT3 antibody .
Figure 2 ( lower panel ) shows that the STAT3 in resting neutrophils seemed to be a doublet , with most material migrating as the faster species .
However , after a 1 min challenge of cells with FMLP ( 1 nM or 1 wM ) or CSa ( 100 nM ) , the protein displayed an up-shift in electrophoretic mobility .

earlier work [ 4-11 ] , these results suggest that STAT3 becomes phosphorylated on serine or threonine during neutrophil stimulation .
To confirm this and to define the site of phosphorylation , we probed blots with an antibody specifically recognizing STAT3 phosphorylated on Ser-727 .
Resting neutrophils contained a band faintly reactive with the antibody .
The intensity of this band increased in cells challenged with CSa , FMLP , GM-CSF , G-CSF or PMA ( Figure 3 ) .
Thus stimuli that activate ERKs generally induced neutrophils to phosphorylate STAT3 on Ser-727 ; however , the two responses do show some divergence .
FMLP , CS5a , and PMA strongly stimulated ERK activation and STAT3 serine phosphorylation , whereas GM-CSF and G-CSF , although eliciting appreciable serine phosphorylation responses , had respectively less or almost no effect on the ERKs ( Figure 3 ) .
This result raises the possibility that some kinase besides the ERK s is at least partly responsible for phosphorylating STAT3 on Ser-727 in cytokine-stimulated neutrophils .

reactivity with phospho ( Ser-727 ) STAT3 antibody ( Figure 4 ) .
Similarly , PD 98059 profoundly inhibited responses to PMA ( results not shown ) .
However , the drug proved far less effective on cytokines .
This is best seen in analyses of the stimuli 's actions over time .
The STAT3 serine phosphorylation response to FMLP was evident at 1 min , reached a maximum by 15 min and remained elevated for 60 min .
PD 98059 almost totally abrogated this response at all durations ( Figure 4 ) .
The GM-CSF-induced response was detectable within 5 min , was maximized at 15 min and lasted for 60 min .
PD 98059 strongly blocked the response developing at 5 or 60 min but not 15 or 30 min after cytokine challenge .
The response at 30 min , in particular , was decreased only marginally by the drug ( Figure 4 ) .
Moreover , PD 98059 failed to decrease STAT3 serine phosphorylation responses to G-CSF after 15 min ( Figure 5 ) as well as after 5 , 30 and 60 min of stimulation ( results not shown ) .
Evidently , therefore , stimulated neutrophils can phosphorylate STAT3 Ser-727 through ERK -independent and ERK -dependent pathways .
Previous studies have implicated one or more H7-sensitive serine kinases in the STAT3 serine-phosphorylation responses of some cells [ 6,7,11,12 ] .
As illustrated in the lower part of Figure 5 , however , stimulus-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was not significantly changed by H7 in neutrophils .

Thus H7 seemed active in neutrophils .
SB 203580 ( 10 uM ) , an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase , also failed to block STAT3 serine-phosphorylation responses ( results not shown ) .
Because tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 's is essential for activating transcription [ 1-3 ] , we probed neutrophil lysates with an antibody specifically recognizing STAT3 phosphorylated on Tyr-705 .
The results confirmed studies [ 26-28 ] showing that STAT3 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells stimulated by GM-CSF or G-CSF .
Neutrophil STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation responses rose to maximal levels within 5-15 min and declined thereafter , returning to near baseline levels within 60 min ( Figures 6 and 7 ) .
In contrast with these findings , there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 at any time ( 1-60 min ) in cells challenged with FMLP , CSa or PMA ( Figure 6 ) .
Cytokines thus exhibit a basic difference from chemotactic factors and a protein kinase C activator in that the latter stimuli induce the phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine but not tyrosine .
In a final series of experiments , we observed that PD 98059 increased the extent of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in cells challenged with GM-CSF ( Figure 7 , upper panel ) .
The effect was most prominent at and after 30 min of stimulation .
The drug also enhanced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation responses to G-CSF ( Figure 7 , lower panel ) although this was less evident than that observed for GM-CSF .
We note that G-CSF was similarly less © 1999 Biochemical Society effective than GM-CSF in stimulating the activation of ERKs ( Figure 3 ) .
These results suggest that the ERK signalling pathway , although mediating the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 , negatively influences its tyrosine phosphorylation .
DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that chemotactic factors , cytokines and a protein kinase C activator stimulate neutrophils to phosphorylate STAT3 .
To identify the site of phosphorylation , we took advantage of an antibody that specifically recognizes the form of STAT3 phosphorylated on Ser-727 .
Ser-727 is located in a consensus site for the MAP kinase family of proline-directed kinases .
This site was in fact phosphorylated in response to all test stimuli ( Figure 3 ) .
Furthermore , PD 98059 , an inhibitor of ERK activation , blocked responses to FMLP , CSa and PMA .
This effect was correlated with the drug 's ability to inhibit the activation of ERKs ( Figure 3 ) and the phosphorylation of p90 `` ( Figure 2 , upper panel ) , a downstream target for ERKs .
Taken together , these results indicate that ERKs are the prevailing upstream kinases for phosphorylating STAT3 on Ser-727 in human neutrophils challenged with chemotactic factors or a protein kinase C activator .
In contrast , PD 98059 proved less effective in decreasing the Ser-727 phosphorylation caused by cytokines .
It only partly blocked GM-CSF in cells challenged for 15-30 min , as opposed to 5 or 60 min ( Figure 4 ) , and had virtually no effect on responses to G-CSF regardless of stimulating time ( Figure 3 ) .
The insensitivity of G-CSF to PD 98059 , along with its minimal effect on ERK s ( Figure 3 ) , implies that an ERK -independent pathway bears the major responsibility for mediating the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by this cytokine .
GM-CSF caused appreciable ERK activation responses ( Figure 3 ) and , on the basis of PD 98059-sensitivity studies , this action apparently led to the phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser-727 at early ( 5 min ) and late ( 60 min ) but not intermediate ( 15-30 min ) times of stimulation .
Because tyrosine phosphorylation signals for the nuclear translocation of STAT3 , the two cytokines , but not chemotactic factors or PMA , probably caused STAT3 to enter the nucleus .
The nuclear STAT3 might then be dephosphorylated and exported back to the cytosol .
These events could explain the peculiar time-dependence of the effect of PD 98059 on GM-CSF , ie .
ERKs phosphorylate cytosolic STAT3 , having dominant effects at early and late times , whereas a PD 98059-insensitive kinase undertakes this phosphorylation during the protein 's residence in the nucleus ( 15-30 min ) .
Figure 4 shows that STAT3 is sub-optimally tyrosine-phosphorylated during these early and late times .
Recent evidence indicates that two pathways , one growth-factor-activated and ERK-dependent , the other interleukin-6-activated and ERK-independent , lead to STAT3 serine phosphorylation [ 11 ] .
The latter pathway has been shown to be highly sensitive to H7 [ 6,7,11 ] .
Because H7 had no such effect in our studies ( Figure 5 ) , the H7-sensitive kinase does not seem to be responsible for serine-phosphorylating STAT3 in neutrophils .
This does not rule out the possibility that an H7-sensitive pathway regulates STAT3 binding to DNA independently of Ser-727 phosphorylation [ 10 ] .
We observed ( results not shown ) that SB 203580 , a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor , failed to decrease serine phosphorylation .
This is consistent with a recent report that STAT3 is a poor substrate for p38 MAP kinase in vitro [ 11 ] .
We note that neutrophils , like other cells [ 11 ] , exhibited an enhanced STAT3 tyrosine-phosphorylation response to GM-CSF and , to a smaller extent , G-CSF in the presence of PD 98059 ( Figure 7 ) .
This suggests that the activation of the ERK pathway Regulation of STAT3 by extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 695 is in some way antagonistic to the phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine .
It will be important to determine whether Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 itself or , alternatively , some other effect of the ERK signalling pathway is responsible for this negative interaction .
ERKs have numerous targets , some of which , for example protein tyrosine phosphatase , might limit the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 .
Activation of STATs has been reported to occur via G-protein-coupled receptors such as the AT 1 angiotensin II receptor [ 31-34 ] .
Our finding that STAT3 is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in neutrophils stimulated with FMLP or CSa indicates that G-protein-coupled receptors are not universally coupled to STAT activation responses ( Figure 6 ) .
These results also question the role of STAT3 serine phosphorylation because it occurs in neutrophils stimulated with chemotactic factors .
STAT transcriptional activity is absolutely dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation , whereas serine phosphorylation is supplementary : the latter is unlikely to be of consequence in the absence of the former .
STAT3 serine phosphorylation might be a byproduct of ERK activation , making no contribution to the action of chemotactic factors on neutrophils .
Alternatively , however , STAT3 serine phosphorylation might participate in non-nuclear signalling , a notion consistent with the presence of several STAT 's in platelets , which lack nuclei [ 35 ] .
It has been suggested that STAT3 can operate as an adaptor protein to couple phosphoinositide 3-kinase with cytokine receptors [ 36 ] .
The serine phosphorylation of STAT3 in neutrophils stimulated with chemotactic factors could similarly have a regulatory role in protein-protein interactions , although this obviously needs further study .
In conclusion , STAT3 phosphorylation on Ser-727 in neutrophils seems to be regulated by two distinct pathways that are recruited in a stimulus-specific manner .
Chemotactic factors and a protein kinase C activator operate mostly or exclusively through the ERK pathway .
Cytokines might use this pathway but also recruit an additional pathway not involving ERKs , p38 MAP kinase or an H7-sensitive kinase .
STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is clearly separable from serine phosphorylation , i.e .
it is caused by cytokines but not by chemotactic factors .
The results prompt further studies to identify the kinase ( s ) , other than ERK s , that phosphorylate STAT3 on serine as well as to clarify the function of serine-phosphorylated STAT3 .
