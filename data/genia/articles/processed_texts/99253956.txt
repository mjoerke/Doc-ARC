Bacterial Peptidoglycan Induces CD14-dependent Activation of Transcription Factors CREB/ATF and AP-1* ( Received for publication , December 17 , 1998 , and in revised form , February 17 , 1999 ) Dipika Guptat $ § , Qiuling Wangt , Charles Vinsont , and Roman Dziarskif From the { Northwest Center for Medical Education , Indiana University School of Medicine , Gary , Indiana 46408 and the Laboratory of Biochemistry , NCI , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 Peptidoglycan ( PGN ) , the major cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria , induces secretion of cytokines in macrophages through CD14 , the pattern recognition receptor that binds lipopolysaccharide and other microbial products .
To begin to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of cytokine genes , we wanted to determine which transcription factors are activated by PGN in mouse RAW264.7 and human THP -1 macrophage cells .
Our results demonstrated that : ( i ) PGN induced phosphorylation of the transcription factors ATF-1 and CREB ; ( ii ) ATF-1 and CREB bound DNA as a dimer and induced transcriptional activation of a CRE reporter plasmid , which was inhibited by dominant negative CREB and ATF-1 ; ( iii ) PGN induced phosphorylation of c-Jun , protein synthesis of JunB and c-Fos , and transcriptional activation of the AP-1 reporter plasmid , which was inhibited by dominant negative c-Fos ; and ( iv ) PGN-induced activation of CREB/ATF and AP-1 was mediated through CD14 .
This is the first study to demonstrate activation of CREB/ATF and AP-1 transcription factors by PGN or by any other component of Gram-positive bacteria .
Peptidoglycan ( PGN ) , a polymer of alternating GleNAc and MurNAc cross-linked by short peptides , is present in all bacterial cell walls and is the major cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria ( 1 ) .
PGN , like lipopolysaccharide ( LPS , the major cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria ) , can induce all major signs and symptoms associated with bacterial infections , including fever , inflammation , leukopenia followed by leukocytosis , hypotension , decreased appetite , decreased peripheral perfusion , malaise , sleepiness , and arthritis ( 2-4 ) .
PGN , together with lipoteichoic acid , also induces circulatory shock and multiple organ failure ( 5 ) .
These clinical manifestations are due to the activation of host cells , such as macro-phages , and release of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant Al28797 ( to R. D. ) .

14012 molecules ( 2-6 ) from activated cells .
Both PGN ( 3 , 7-10 ) and LPS ( 8 , 11-15 ) activate macrophages through the pattern recognition receptor CD14 .
However , there are several differences in the interaction of PGN and LPS with CD14 ( 8 , 10 , 16 ) .
TNF-a ( 6 , 16 ) , IL-1 ( 7 ) , and IL-6 ( 7 , 16 ) are the main cytokines released from PGN-activated macrophages .
However , the signal transduction pathways that culminate in transcriptional activation of these cytokine genes are so far unknown .
The promoters for these cytokine genes contain binding sites for various transcription factors , including NF- « B , AP-1 , and CREB .
We have previously shown activation of NF- « B by PGN ( 8 ) , but it is not known if PGN induces activation of any other transcription factors .
It is also not known which transcription factors are required for PGN-induced activation of cytokine genes .
The CREB/ATF family of transcription factors are leucine zipper proteins that bind to the cAMP response element ( CRE ) with the consensus sequence , 5 { -TGACGTCA-3 ' ( 17 ) .
CREB , the most extensively studied CRE-binding protein , is phosphorylated at serine 133 by protein kinase A in response to cAMP , and this leads to transcriptional activation ( 17 ) of genes whose promoters contain the CRE sequence .
There are other signaling pathways that lead to phosphorylation and activation of CREB , such as calmodulin kinase , which phosphorylates CREB in response to increased intracellular Ca** ( 17 ) , or RSK2 which is activated by mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases ( 18 ) .
ATF-1 , another member of this family of transcription factors , has significant sequence similarity to CREB , including a phosphorylation domain ( 17 ) .
ATF-1 forms heterodimers only with CREB ; however , the other ATF proteins can also form heterodimers with specific members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors .
In addition , different heterodimers may bind variant CRE sequences , thus increasing the number of potential regulatory mechanisms .
The AP-1 family of transcription factors consists of the Jun and Fos families of proteins that bind the 12-O-tetradeca-noylphorbol-13-acetate response element ( TPA-RE ) , 5'-TGAC-TCA-3 ' and induce transcription in response to many different stimuli , including phorbol esters ( 19 ) .
These proteins bind DNA as dimers , which are formed through leucine zippers .
The Jun proteins can bind DNA as homodimers or as heterodimers with Fos proteins ; however , the Fos proteins can only bind DNA as heterodimers ( 19 ) .
In addition to forming heterodimers within the AP-1 family , Jun proteins can heterodimerize with certain members of other transcription factor families , such as ATF and C/EBP $ ( 19 ) .
Different dimers can bind different sequences , e.g .
Jun-Jun and Jun-Fos dimers preferentially bind TPA-RE , while Jun-ATF dimers prefer to bind the CRE sequence ( 19 ) .
The objective of this study was to : ( i ) determine if PGN activates the transcription factors CREB/ATF and AP-1 , ( ii ) identify the specific members of these two families of transcrip- This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Bacterial Peptidoglycan Activates CREB/ATF and AP-1 tion factors that are activated by PGN , and ( iii ) determine if this activation is CD14-dependent .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials-Soluble PGN ( sPGN ) , a soluble polymeric form of PGN , was isolated from Staphylococcus aureus Rb grown in the presence of penicillin ( 20 ) and purified by vancomycin affinity chromatography , and its purity has been previously described ( 21 ) .
sPGN contained < 24 pg of endotoxin/mg , as determined by the Limulus lysate assay ( 21 ) .
LPS from Salmonella minnesota Re 595 ( ReLPS , a minimal naturally occurring endotoxic structure of LPS ) , obtained by phenol-chloroform-petro-leum ether extraction , was purchased from Sigma .
All other chemicals were from Sigma , unless otherwise indicated .
Cells-Murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line , obtained from ATCC ( Rockville , MD ) , was cultured in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium with 10 % defined fetal calf serum ( HyClone , Logan , UT ; endotoxin content < 6 pg/ml ) .
Human monocytic THP-1 cell line , obtained from ATCC , was cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10 % defined fetal calf serum .
For each experiment , THP-1 cells were allowed to differentiate for 72 h in the presence of 100 nM 1 @ ,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , ( Biomol , Plymouth Meeting , PA ) .
Phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB and Western Blots-RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at 0.85-0.4 X 10°/ml in 24-well plates ( 2 ml/well ) and cultured for 16-20 h. THP-1 cells were seeded at 0.15 X 10°/ml in 24-well plates ( 2 ml/well ) and allowed to differentiate as above for 72 h. All cells were activated with the stimulants indicated under `` Results `` and then washed and lysed as before ( 6 ) .
In some experiments , sPGN and ReLPS were incubated with 5 ug/ml polymyxin B for 30 min and then added to cells .
In other experiments , THP-1 cells were incubated with 10 ug/ml anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies , MY4 ( Coulter , Hi-aleah , FL ) or MEM18 ( Sanbio-Monosan , Uden , The Netherlands ) , or the isotype control IgG2b ( clone MPC-11 ; Coulter ) for 30 min at 37 °C before stimulation .
Cell lysates were separated on 12 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P ( 6 ) .
Phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB was determined by Western blotting with 0.5 ug/ml rabbit anti-pCREB antibody ( Upstate Biotechnology , Inc. , Lake Placid , NY ) , and detected by the ECL system .
This antibody specifically recognizes the phosphorylated forms of both ATF-1 and CREB .
Control blots were done with 0.5 ug/ml rabbit anti-CREB ( Upstate Biotechnology ) or rabbit anti-ATF-1 monoclonal antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , which recognize both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of CREB or ATF-1 , respectively .
Activation of AP-1 and Western Blots-Cells were cultured , acti-vated , and lysed as described for ATF-1/CREB .
Phosphorylation of c-Jun protein was detected using a monoclonal antibody generated against a c-Jun peptide containing phosphorylated serine 63 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Nonphosphorylated c-Jun , Jun B , Jun D , and c-Fos were also detected by Western blots using antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
Enzyme Digestions-30-ug aliquots of sPGN biosynthetically labeled with [ `` Clalanine ( 20 ) were digested for 72 h at 87°C with 1 mg/ml affinity-purified lysostaphin or 1 mg/ml lysozyme ( Grade I from chicken egg , from Sigma ) , or buffer alone ( as a control ) , and were dialyzed four times ( 10-12-kDa cut-off ) against Dulbecco 's phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C ( 10 ) .
The extent of digestion was determined by measuring the amount of *C remaining in the samples after dialysis .
Phosphatase Treatment-Stimulated and control RAW264.7 cells were lysed in three different buffers depending on the phosphatase treatment ( 22 ) .
The first group of cells was lysed in the same buffer as above with 0.8 % Nonidet P-40 for control samples .
The second group of cells was lysed in 50 mM Tris , pH 7.5 , 1 mM MgCl , , 0.8 % Nonidet P-40 , and protease inhibitors , and digested with 250 units/ml alkaline phosphatase for 15 min at 30 °C .
The third group of cells was lysed in 50 mM Tris , pH 7.5 , 1 mM MnCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol , with 0.8 % Nonidet P-40 , 1.0 nM okadaic acid , and protease inhibitors , and digested with 2.9 units/ml protein phosphatase 2A ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) for 20 min at 37 °C .
The final Nonidet P-40 concentration in all samples was 0.6 % .
The samples were separated on 12 % SDS-PAGE and analyzed for phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated c-Jun by Western blots .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays-Cells were cultured as described above for Western blots , and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously ( 8 ) .
5 ug of nuclear protein were first incubated with different antibodies as indicated under `` Results , `` for 20 min at 22 °C .
The nuclear proteins were then incubated with *°P-labeled oligonucleotide containing consensus CRE ( 17 ) or TPA-RE ( 19 ) binding sites ( AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAG and AGCTTGATGACT-CAGCCG , respectively ) , for 30 min at 22°C .
Anti-Jun antibody was 14013 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , and all other antibodies used in these experiments were as described above .
In some experiments , the samples were preincubated with an excess of unlabeled specific or nonspecific oligonucleotide for 20 min at 22 °C .
All samples were then separated on 5 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels , and the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography .
Transfection and Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase ( CAT ) and Luciferase Assays-RAW264.7 cells were cultured at 0.85-0.4 X 10°/ml in six-well plates ( 2 ml/well ) for 16-20 h and transfected with 200 ug/ml DEAE-dextran and DNA ( the amount of DNA used was optimized for different plasmids and is indicated in the figure legends ) .
The following plasmids were used for transfections : A ( -71 ) Som-CAT ( 28 ) , A-CREB ( 24 ) , pAP1-Luc ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) , 2xAP1-Lue ( 25 ) , -78Col-Lue ( 26 ) , -60Col-Lue ( 26 ) , A-Fos ( 27 ) , and A-ATF1 , which was constructed as described previously ( 24 ) .
Cells were allowed to recover for 24-48 h and then were left unstimulated or were stimulated as described in the figure legends .
Lysates were prepared and were assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Reporter kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) or for CAT activity as described ( 22 ) .
RESULTS sPGN Induces Phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB-Acti-vation of the transcription factor CREB is regulated by phosphorylation at serine 183 .
ATF-1 , also a CRE-binding protein , has extensive homology to CREB , including a conserved phosphorylation site .
We tested if sPGN induces phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-1 in RAW264.7 cells , using an antibody that specifically recognizes both phosphorylated CREB and phosphorylated ATF-1 .
sPGN induced rapid and transient dose-dependent phosphorylation of both ATF-1 and CREB ( Fig .
1 , A and D ) with similar kinetics .
The control stimulant , ReLPS , also induced phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB with kinetics similar to those seen with sPGN .
The phosphorylation of ATF-1 was stronger than phosphorylation of CREB for both stimu-lants .
Identical samples analyzed with antibodies that recognize both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CREB ( Fig .
1B ) and ATF-1 ( Fig .
1C ) showed equal amounts of CREB and ATF-1 protein present in all lanes .
sPGN-induced phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB was not inhibited by polymyxin B ( an antibiotic that binds LPS and inhibits its biologic effects ) , unlike the induction by ReLPS , which was almost completely inhibited ( Fig .
1D ) .
This confirms that the sPGN-induced effect was not due to endotoxin contam-ination .
In control experiments , the amounts of total ( phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated ) CREB ( Fig .
12 ) and ATF-1 ( not shown ) proteins were the same in all samples .
Composition of CREB/ ATF Complexes That Bind CRE Consensus Sequence-To determine if CREB and ATF-1 bind to the CRE sequence and to determine the composition of the CRE-binding complexes , supershift assays were performed with an oligonucleotide containing the CRE consensus sequence and antibodies to specific proteins in the CREB/ATF and AP-1 families of transcription factors .
The AP-1 family was included because Jun proteins also bind CRE sequence .
Nuclear extracts from sPGN- or ReLPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells contained proteins that bind to the CRE consensus site ( the protein-DNA complex ran higher than the free oligonucleotide ) ( Fig .
24 ) .
There was no difference in the binding of proteins to the CRE site between stimulated and control cells ( Fig .
24 , compare lanes I for Nil , sPGN , and ReLPS samples ) .
This is characteristic of the protein complex that binds CRE sequence , where activation does not result in a change of the binding of the proteins , but induces phosphorylation of the already bound proteins ( 17 ) .
The protein-DNA complexes with nuclear extracts from sPGN- or ReLPS-stimulated cells were supershifted by antibodies against CREB-1 , pCREB , and ATF-1 , but not against ATF-2 , Jun , and c-Fos ( Fig .
24 ) .
This indicates that the protein dimer that binds CRE consensus sequence in sPGN- or ReLPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells consists of ATF-1 and CREB .

1. sPGN and ReLPS induce phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB : time kinetics , dose response , and effect of polymyxin B. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with 10 ug/ml sPGN or 10 ng/ml ReLPS for the indicated times , and total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blots for : phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB using an anti-phosphorylated CREB Ab ( 4 ) , total ( phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated ) CREB using an anti-CREB Ab ( B ) , or total ATF-1 protein using an anti-ATF-1 Ab ( C ) .
Cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of sPGN or ReLPS for 80 min .
Cells stimulated in the presence or absence of polymyxin B were stimulated with 10 ug/ml sPGN or 10 ng/ml ReLPS .
Total cell lysates were analyzed for phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB ( D ) or total CREB ( E ) .
pCREB , pATF-1 , CREB , and ATF-1 are indicated by arrows ; all other bands are nonspecific .
The results are from one of three similar experiments .
were no qualitative differences in the specific transcription factors that bind the CRE site between stimulated and nonstimulated cells ; however , there was a difference in the amount of CREB and pCREB in the bound complex between stimulated and nonstimulated cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
The amount of pCREB increased upon stimulation by sPGN or ReLPS , as the antibodies against pCREB caused a complete shift of the protein-oligonu-cleotide complex from the stimulated cells ( compare the pCREB lanes between stimulated and control in Fig .
24 ) .
These results confirm that upon stimulation DNA-bound CREB undergoes phosphorylation , which has been shown to activate CREB .
The specificity of binding to the CRE sequence was confirmed using excess unlabeled specific and nonspecific oligonucleotides ( Fig .
2B ) .
In nuclear extracts from both sPGN- or ReLPS-stimulated cells , the binding of proteins to the oligonucleotide carrying CRE sequence was inhibited by an excess of unlabeled specific oligonucleotide ( CRE ) , but not by a nonspecific ( NS ) oligonucleotide with no CRE sequence ( Fig .
2B ) .
These data indicate that the proteins that bind the CRE oligonucleotide specifically recognize the CRE sequence .

CREB and ATF-1 bind to CRE consensus sequence in sPGN- or ReLPS-stimulated cells .
A , RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with 10 ug/ml sPGN or 10 ng/ml ReLPS for 30 min and nuclear extracts were preincubated with the indicated Abs for 20 min , followed by a 80-min incubation with a radioactively labeled oligonucleotide containing a CRE consensus sequence .
The DNA-protein complexes were separated on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel .
The arrows indicate the shift in the DNA-protein complexes upon Ab binding .
B , specificity of binding to CRE sites was demonstrated using an excess of unlabeled specific ( CRE ) and nonspecific ( NS ) oligonucleotides .
The results are from one of two similar experiments .
RAW264.7 cells with the plasmid A ( -71 ) Som-CAT or empty vector ( CMV ) and tested for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activity in the transfected cells after stimulation with sPGN or ReLPS .
The plasmid A ( -71 ) Som-CAT contains -71 to +53 bp of somatostatin promoter fused to the CAT gene , and this plasmid has been shown previously to be regulated by CREB ( 23 ) .
Both sPGN and ReLPS induced 14.1 + 2.5-fold and 13.4 + 2.1-fold ( means + S.E .
, n = 6 ) increase , respectively , in CAT activity in transfected macrophage cells ( Fig .
34 ) .
RAW264.7 cells transfected with the empty vector showed no induced CAT activity upon stimulation ( Fig .
34 ) .
To determine if the induced CAT activity in sPGN- or ReLPS-stimulated cells was due to ATF-1 and/or CREB , we co-transfected RAW264.7 cells with A ( -71 ) Som-CAT and A-ATFl ( a dominant negative inhibitor of ATF-1 ) , A-CREB ( a dominant negative inhibitor of CREB ) , or the empty CMV .
These dominant negative proteins were constructed by fusing an acidic extension at the N terminus of the leucine zipper domain .
This acidic region of the recombinant protein binds the basic region of the wild type protein , and the basic region is thus no longer available for binding to DNA .
Both dominant negative ATF-1 and dominant negative CREB , individually or in combination , inhibited the sPGN- or ReLPS-induced activation of CAT reporter gene ( Fig .
3B ) .
This inhibition was specific for A-ATFL and A-CREB , as the empty vector did not inhibit sPGN- or ReLPS- induced CAT activity .
These results provide evidence that sPGN and ReLPS induce functional activation of the transcription factors ATF-1 and CREB .
sPGN and ReLPS Induce Phosphorylation of c-Jun and Protein Synthesis of JunB and c-Fos-We next determined if sPGN and ReLPS induce activation of the transcription factor AP-1 .
The AP-1 transcription factor family consists of proteins which include c-Jun , JunB , JunD , and c-Fos .

3. sPGN and ReLPS induce transactivation of a CREB-regulated gene , and this induction is inhibited by dominant negative CREB ( A-CREB ) and dominant negative ATF-1 ( A-ATF1 ) .
A , RAW264.7 cells were transfected with 1.0 ug/ml CREB-regulated CAT plasmid , A ( -71 ) Som-CAT , or empty vector , pUC18 ; 24 h after transfection , cells were stimulated with 10 ug/ml sPGN or 10 ng/ml ReLPS for 86 h or left unstimulated .
Cell lysates were prepared , and aliquots were assayed for CAT activity .
The results are means of duplicate samples from one out of six similar experiments .
B , cells were co-transfected with 1.0 ug/ml A ( -71 ) Som-CAT and 2.0 ug/ml A-ATF1 , or A-CREB , or empty vector ( CMV ) , or 2.0 ug/ml each of A-ATF1 and A-CREB or 4.0 ug/ml CMV and were stimulated and assayed as in A .
The percent of empty vector = ( mean cpm stimulated with dominant negative - mean cpm unstimulated with dominant negative ) X 100/ ( mean cpm stimulated with empty vector - mean cpm unstimulated with empty vector ) .

binds to the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate response el-ement , usually as a Jun-Fos heterodimer .
c-Jun is activated by phosphorylation of serine 63 and serine 73 .
To test if sPGN activates c-Jun , RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with sPGN or ReLPS and phosphorylation of c-Jun was measured using an antibody specific to phosphorylated serine 63 and the adjacent c-Jun sequence .
sPGN consistently induced rapid and transient dose-dependent phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation of c-Jun ( Fig .
4 , A and C ) .
ReLPS induced phosphorylation of c-Jun similar to that seen with sPGN ( Fig .
4 , A and C ) .
Stripping and reprobing the blots with anti-c-Jun antibody , which recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated protein , revealed that sPGN and ReLPS stimulation also causes a modest increase ( 1.5-2 times ) in the total ( phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated ) amount of c-Jun protein ( Fig .
4 , B and D ) .
This is not unexpected as activated c-Jun protein induces transcription of the c-Jun gene ( 19 ) .
sPGN-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun was not inhibited by polymyxin B , in contrast to the phosphorylation induced by ReLPS , which was completely inhibited by polymyxin B ( Fig .
4C ) .
These data confirm that sPGN-induced activation of RAW264.7 cells and phosphorylation of c-Jun is due to PGN and not due to an endotoxin contaminant in our sPGN prepa-ration .
In control experiments , the amount of c-Jun protein did not change with polymyxin B treatment , for either stimulant ( Fig .
4D ) .
To confirm that the anti-phosphorylated c-Jun antibody recognizes phosphorylated c-Jun , samples were treated with different phosphatases and then analyzed by Western blot .
Cell lysates from both sPGN- and ReLPS-stimulated cells , treated with alkaline phosphatase , a nonspecific phosphatase , did not show any binding to the anti-phosphorylated c-Jun antibody ( Fig .
46 ) .
Furthermore , protein phosphatase 2A , a serine phosphatase , strongly diminished binding to the anti-phosphorylated c-Jun antibody ( Fig .
46 ) .
However , the binding to the anti-c-Jun antibody was not eliminated or reduced by either 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 14016 Bacterial Peptidoglycan Activates CREB/ATF and AP-1 A anti-pcJun Blot B anti-cJun Blot sPGN ReLPS sPGN ReLPS o o o o 0 o 0 o Min o 2838 % 0 `` 88 `` & Min 0238830288 `` § 56 - 56 ias an m « - ‘ .

RAW264.7 cells were stimulated as in Fig .

4C for B and analyzed for total protein using an anti-JunB Ab ( A and B ) , anti-JunD Ab ( C ) , or anti-cFos Ab ( D ) .

JunB , JunD , and c-Fos are indicated by arrows ; all other bands are nonspecific .
The results are from one of two similar experiments .
c-Jun , JunB , and c-Fos Bind to the TPA-RE Consensus Sequence in sPGN-stimulated Cells-To identify the specific members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors that bind the TPA-RE consensus sequence , gel shift assays were per-formed .
The binding of proteins to an oligonucleotide with the TPA-RE sequence showed no differences between sPGN- or ReLPS-stimulated and unstimulated RAW264.7 cells ( Fig .
6 ; gel shift assays with unstimulated lysates are not shown ) .
Using a supershift assay and a series of antibodies that recognize different members of the AP-1 and CREB family of transcription factors , we determined that in both sPGN- and ReLPS-stimulated cells ( Fig .
6A ) and in unstimulated cells ( data not shown ) c-Jun , JunB , and c-Fos bind to the TPA-RE sequence .
The specificity of the oligonucleotide that was used in the supershift assays was confirmed by inhibition of binding of nuclear proteins by an excess of unlabeled specific oligonucleo-tide , but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide with no TPA-RE sequence ( Fig .
6B ) .
sPGN Induces Transactivation of an AP-I-regulated Gene That Is Inhibited by Dominant Negative c-Fos-To determine if sPGN induced functional activation of AP-1 , we transfected RAW264.7 cells with the plasmid pAP1-Luce , which has seven AP-1 binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene , or -60Col-Luc , which has no AP-1 binding sites .
Cells transfected with pAP1-Luc showed an average 9.0 + 0.6-fold and 9.4 + 1.4-fold ( means + S.E .

Cell lysates were prepared , and aliquots were assayed for luciferase activity .
The results are means of duplicate samples from one out of three similar experiments .

We also confirmed activation of AP-1 by sPGN or ReLPS using two additional plasmids : -783Col-Lue , which has -73 to +63 bp of the collagenase promoter fused to the luciferase gene , and 2xAP1-Luc , which has two AP-1 binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that sPGN and ReLPS induced functional activation of the transcription factor AP-1 .

A-Fos heterodimerizes with Jun proteins in an AP-1 complex and inactivates their ability to bind DNA .
A-Fos , but not the empty vector , inhibited both sPGN- and ReLPS-induced increases in luciferase activity ( Fig .
7B ) .
These results confirm that sPGN and ReLPS induce a functionally active AP-1 , and that c-Fos and Jun form the active AP-1 complex .
sPGN-induced Phosphorylation of CREB and c-Jun in Human Monocytes Is CD14-dependent-Since we have previously shown that sPGN-induced activation of NF-kB is mediated through the membrane receptor CD14 ( 8 ) , we now determined if sPGN-induced phosphorylation of CREB and c-Jun also requires CD14 .
We first tested if sPGN induced phosphorylation of CREB and c-Jun in the human monocyte cell line THP-1 .
THP-1 cells activated with sPGN and ReLPS showed phosphorylation of CREB ( Fig .
8A ) .
THP -1 cells differed from the mouse RAW264.7 cells , in that they did not have detectable levels of ATF-1 , which in RAW264.7 cells was present in high amounts ( Fig .
1C ) and was strongly phosphorylated upon stimulation of the cells ( Fig .
14 ) .
Total amount of CREB did not change upon cell activation by sPGN or ReLPS ( Fig .
8B ) .
sPGN or ReLPS also induced phosphorylation of c-Jun in THP-1 cells ( Fig .
8C ) and an increase in the total amount of c-Jun protein ( Fig .
8D ) .
The increase in c-Jun protein may be due to the activated c-Jun itself , which is known to induce transcription of the c-Jun gene ( 19 ) .
Anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies , MY4 and MEM18 , inhibited both sPGN- and ReLPS-induced phosphorylation of CREB ( Fig .
8E ) and c-Jun ( Fig .
8F ) .
These data confirm that sPGN and ReLPS activate cells through CD14 and that CD14 is required for both sPGN- and ReLPS-induced phosphorylation of CREB and c-Jun .
Lysostaphin and Lysozyme Reduce sPGN-induced Phosphorylation of ATF-1 , CREB , and c-Jun-To confirm the identity of sPGN as the activating molecule that induces phosphorylation of ATF-1 , CREB , and c-Jun , sPGN was digested with lysostaphin or lysozyme , enzymes that specifically degrade PGN .
Digestion with both enzymes reduced sPGN-induced phosphorylation of ATF-1 and CREB ( Fig .
94 ) and c-Jun ( Fig .
9C ) , and this reduction was proportional to the extent of digestion of sPGN ( Fig .
96 ) .
As expected , the total amount of CREB ( Fig .
9B ) and c-Jun ( Fig .
9D ) proteins remained the same in all treated and untreated groups .

Lysostaphin and lysozyme treatments reduce the capacity of sPGN to induce phosphorylation of ATF-L/CREB and c-Jun .
[ '*C ] Ala-labeled sPGN was digested with 1 mg/ml lysostaphin or lysozyme for 72 h or left undigested , and then dialyzed against Dulbecco 's phosphate-buffered saline .
Aliquots of dialyzed sPGN were used to stimulate RAW264.7 cells ( A-D ) at 2 pg/ml or to measure the remaining '*C in nondialyzable ( undigested macromolecular ) sPGN ( £ ) .
Cell lysates were analyzed with antibodies to : phosphorylated CREB ( A ) , total CREB ( B ) , phosphorylated c-Jun ( C ) , and total c-Jun ( D ) .
ATF-1 and CREB and these proteins bind DNA as a dimer ; ( ii ) PGN induces phosphorylation of c-Jun , protein synthesis of JunB and c-Fos , and functional activation of the transcription factor AP-1 ; and ( iii ) PGN-induced activation of CREB/ATF and AP-1 is mediated through CD14 .
This is the first study to demonstrate activation of these transcription factors by PGN or by any other component of Gram-positive bacteria .
Our data also confirm that : ( i ) CREB and ATF-1 from LPS-activated nuclear extracts bind the CRE sequence ( 28 ) ; ( ii ) LPS induces phosphorylation of CREB ( 28 ) ; ( iii ) LPS induces increase in JunB protein , but not JunD ( 29 ) ; and ( iv ) JunB and c-Jun bind the TPA-RE sequence ( 29 ) .
In addition , our data demonstrate : ( i ) that LPS induces phosphorylation of ATF-1 and c-Jun , and ( ii ) that LPS-induced activation of CREB/ATF and AP-1 is CD14-dependent , which are new findings for LPS .
Our data also demonstrate that LPS induces transcriptional activation : ( i ) of a CRE reporter plasmid and that this activation is mediated by a complex of ATF-1 and CREB , and ( ii ) of an AP-1 reporter plasmid and that this activation is mediated by a complex containing c-Fos proteins .
These data are in agreement with other investigators ' results showing that the CRE sites in the promoters of TNF-a ( 30 ) , ( 31 ) , and P-selectin ( 82 ) genes are necessary for LPS-induced transcriptional activity of these genes .
Also in agreement with our findings are the results showing that site-specific mutations in the CRE site in the IL-1B promoter result in a substantial loss in transcriptional induction following combined stimulation with LPS , phorbol myristate acetate , and dibutyryl cAMP ( 83 ) , and also that the AP-1 site is required for LPS-induced transcrip- 14019 tional activation of tissue factor ( 34 ) and heme oxygenase ( 85 ) genes .
However , the actual protein complex that binds the CRE or AP-1 site and regulates transcription may be different for different genes , e.g .
the CRE site in the IL-1B promoter binds CREB and ATF-1 ( 33 ) , while the c-Jun protein binds the CRE site in the human TNF-a promoter , and the amount of c-Jun bound to this site increases when cells are stimulated with LPS ( 30 ) .
In addition , different proteins may have different effects on transcription , e.g .
c-Jun is an effective transcriptional acti-vator , while JunB is not , and thus JunB may have an inhibi-tory function ( 26 ) .
These data emphasize the importance of the CRE and AP-1 sites and the CREB/ATF and AP-1 families of transcription factors in LPS-induced transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes .
These transcription factors and their binding sites may also play a significant role in PGN-induced inflammatory response .
Although both PGN ( 10 ) and LPS ( 36 ) bind to CD14 and activate cells through CD14 ( 8 ) , there are several differences in the function of CD14 as the PGN and LPS receptor .
In partic-ular , both the binding sites for PGN and LPS on CD14 and the sites needed for cell activation are partially similar but partially different ( 8 , 10 ) , and only LPS-induced , but not PGN-induced cell activation and binding affinity for CD14 are enhanced by the LPS-binding protein ( 7 , 10 ) .
Moreover , PGN and LPS induce differential activation of MAP kinases , with LPS strongly inducing all three families of kinases ( ERK , JNK , and p38 ) , but with PGN only inducing ERK and JNK , but not p38 ( 37 ) .
Furthermore , soluble CDI4LPS complexes activate CD14-negative cells , whereas soluble CD14PGN complexes do not ( 16 ) .
Despite these differences , in this study we did not detect any differences between PGN and LPS in the activation of CREB/ ATF and AP-1 transcription factors .
Therefore , our current and previous ( 8 ) results indicate that transcription factors NF-KB , CREB/ATE-1 , and AP-1 are either induced by CD14-dependent signal transduction pathways that are common for PGN and LPS , or that different pathways activated by PGN and LPS converge to activate these three families of transcription factors .
Such a convergence of initially different signal transduction pathways to activate the same transcription factors has been demonstrated in the activation of cells through cytokine receptors , e.g .
IL-1 and TNF- « ( 88 ) .
The signal transduction pathway ( s ) through which PGN and LPS activate CREB/ATF and AP-1 are still not clear .
Activation of AP-1 is consistent with the strong activation of JNK and ERK1 and ERK2 by both PGN and LPS ( 37 ) , since JNK can activate c-Jun and both JNK and ERK can induce c-Fos through activation of ternary complex factor/Elk-1 ( 39 ) .
The possible mechanism of activation of ATF-1 and CREB are less clear , since in other systems the main mechanism of activation of ATF-1 and CREB is through protein kinase A , but we could not show any activation of protein kinase A by PGN or LPS ( 37 ) .
Other possible mechanisms of activation could involve calmodulin kinase or the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 ( 17 , 18 ) .
The functional significance of the activation of NF- « B , CREB/ATF , and AP-1 for the induction of cytokine genes by PGN is still not clear .
As seen for LPS , these transcription factors are required for the induction of specific genes coding for pro-inflammatory molecules , and our preliminary data indicate that NF-kB , CREB , and ATF-1 , but not AP-1 , are required for PGN-induced transcriptional activation of TNF-a . ``
These transcription factors are also likely to play a role in the ° D. Gupta and Q. Wang , unpublished observation .
610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 14020 induction of several other pro-inflammatory molecules , such as cytokines , chemokines , and adhesion molecules in PGN-activated cells .
In summary , we demonstrate that activation of macrophages by PGN leads to the functional activation of the transcription factors CREB/ATF and AP-1 and that this activation is CD14-dependent .
