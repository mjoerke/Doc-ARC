We have recently identified and cloned a human transcription factor , TCF-1 , that binds to a functional element in the T lymphocyte-specific enhancer of CD3-e .
In a panel of human cell lines , TCF-1 expression was restricted to T lineage cells .
TCF-1 belonged to a novel family of genes that contain the so-called high mobility group 1 ( HMG ) box .
Here we report the cloning of murine TCF-1 .
Two splice alternatives were identified that were not previously observed in human TCPF-1 .
Murine and human TCF-1 displayed a 95.5 % overall amino acid homology .
Recombinant murine and human TCF-1 recognized the same sequence motif in the CD3-e enhancer as judged by gel retardation and methylation interference assays .
With the murine cDNA clones several aspects of TCF-1 were analyzed .
First , deletion analysis revealed that a region of TCF-1 containing the HMG box was sufficient for sequence-specific binding .
Second , by high stringency Northern blotting and in situ hybridization , TCF-1 expression was shown to be confined to the thymus and to the T cell areas of the spleen .
Third , TCF-1 bound specifically to a functional T cell-specific element in the T cell receptor a ( TCR- ) enhancer .
The T lineage-specific expression and the affinity for functional motifs in the TCR- and CD3-e enhancers imply an important role for TCF-1 in the establishment of the mature T cell phenotype .
he phenotype of a cell is determined by the complement of actively transcribed structural genes in that cell .
A differentiating cell proceeds through a program of phenotype changes .
Unique sets of structural genes are expressed at each step .
Control of the expression of such sets of genes is exerted principally by developmentally active transcription factors ; the activation and inactivation of these transcription factors is believed to be central to the control of phenotype during differentiation ( 1-3 ) .
In recent years , it has become feasible to identify the cis-acting elements ( promoters , enhancers , silencers ) that control transcription of structural genes expressed at particular stages of differentiation .
These cis-acting elements can be used to identify DNA-binding transcription factors that recognize specific sequence motifs within these elements .
Of special interest are transcription factors that are uniquely active in the cell type where the structural gene is expressed .
Several so-called `` tissue-specific `` transcription factors have thus been identified and cloned .
These include the B lymphocyte factor Oct-2 , which binds the octamer motif ( ATT of the B cell-specific regulatory elements of the Ig genes ( 4 , 5 ) ; the pituitary factor Pit-1 , which controls growth hormone and prolactin gene expression in somatotroph and lactotroph cells respectively ( 6 , 7 ) ; the erythrocyte factor EryFI , which binds to hemoglobin regulatory sequences ( 8 , 9 ) ; and MyoD ( and several related genes ) , which can confer the muscle cell phenotype onto fibroblasts ( 10 , 11 ) .
The recent identification of a number of T lymphocyte-specific enhancers ( reviewed in reference 12 ) allows the characterization of transcription factors that govern the differentiation pathway of the T lymphocyte .
We have set out to analyze the T cell-specific enhancer of the gene encoding the CD3-e chain of the TCR/CD3 complex ( 13-15 ) .
We have recently described and cloned a transcription factor from human T cells , TCF-1 , that is involved in the activity of this enhancer ( 16 ) .
TCF-1 was initially detected by gel 1133 J. Exp .

Methylation interference footprinting revealed that the TCF-1 cognate motif in the CD3-€ enhancer consisted of AAcAAAG ( where contact bases are capitalized ) .
TCF-1 was subsequently cloned and was found to be a member of a family of genes with homology to high mobility group I ( HMG ) !
proteins .
This family includes the polymerase I transcription factor UBF ( 17 ) , the putative mammalian sex-determining gene SRY ( 18 ) , and S. pombe and N. crassa mating type genes ( 19 , 20 ) .
Three alternative splice forms of the TCF-1 gene were identified that differed at the extreme COOH terminus of the encoded protein .
These alternative splice forms were termed TCF-1A , TCF-1B , and TCF-1C .
Within a panel of cell lines , the TCF-1 gene was expressed uniquely in T cells .
Finally , recombinant TCF-1 could transactivate transcription through its cognate motif .
Here , we report the isolation and analysis of murine TCF-1 cDNA clones .
Materials and Methods Cells .
- Human T cell lines Jurkat , Molt4 , and Peer ; the murine TCR-a/ $ T cell line EL-4 ; human B lineage cell lines BS 4.9 and Daudi ; and the murine B lineage line Ag-8 were all grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 % FCS and antibiotics .
The human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and murine fibroblasts NIH-3T3 were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5 % FCS and antibiotics .
Nuclear Extracts .
- Nuclear extracts were prepared by gentle lysis of 10-108 cells in lysis buffer ( 30 % sucrose [ wt/vol } ; 40 mM Tris [ pH 7.5 ] ; 37 mM KCl ; 12 mM MgCl ; ) in the presence of 0.8 % Triton X-100 .
After two washes with lysis buffer , the nuclei were extracted with 2.5 pellet volumes of extraction buffer ( 10 mM Hepes [ pH 7.9 } ; 400 mM NaCl ; 1.5 mM MgCl ; ; 0.2 mM EGTA ; 20 % glycerol ) for 30 min on ice .
Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation ( 15,000 rpm ; 5 min ) .
Protein concentration of the clear supernatant was determined and nuclear extracts were stored at -70°C .
Gel Retardation Assay .
- Annealed oligonucleotides were labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase and 7- [ P ] -ATP .
All probes were purified by polyacrylamide electrophoresis .
For a typical binding reaction , nuclear extract ( 5 ug protein ) and 1 ug poly dI-dC were incubated in a volume of 15 ul containing 10 mM Hepes , 60 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , and 12 % glycerol .
After 5 min of preincubation at room temperature , a probe ( 20,000 cpm ) was added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min .
The samples were then subjected to electrophoresis through a non-denaturing 4 % polyacrylamide gel run in 0.25 * TBE at room tem-perature .
In competition experiments , nonlabeled competitor DNA was added with the poly dI-dC .

All oligonucleotides were synthesized on a cell synthesizer ( 381A ; Applied Biosystems , Inc. , Foster City , CA ) .
Isolation of cDNA Clones .
- Murine TCF-1 cDNA clones were isolated from an EL-4 cDNA library in A-ZAP ( 106 primary recombinant phages ; average insert size , 1.2 kb ) by standard hybridization screening at low stringency using the insert of @ TCF-1 ( 16 ) as the probe ( 21 ) .
DNA Sequencing Sequencing was performed on double-stranded DNA templates using T7 DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Pis-cataway , NJ ) .
Sequencing templates were generated by subcloning the inserts of isolated cDNA clones , and BA131 deletions thereof into pUC19 .
Sequencing primers were the universal and reverse M13 primers , and oligonucleotides representing specific internal sequences of the cDNA clones .
RNA Isolation and Analysis .
Total RNA was prepared by cell lysis in RNAzol according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Cinna-Biotecx ) , followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and 2-propanol precipitation .
10 ug of total RNA per lane was run for Northern analysis on 1 % agarose containing 6 % formaldehyde .
RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized with murine TCF-1 cDNA probes labeled by random oligo priming , all according to standard procedures ( 21 ) .
In Situ Hybridization .
- In situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded thymus and spleen sections ( 2-wk-old male BALB/c ) was performed essentially as described by Wilkinson et al .
( 22 ) , with modifications introduced by Kress et al .
( 23 ) .
An antisense `` S-labeled RNA TCF-1 probe was generated using T7 RNA polymerase and Template was prepared by subcloning the insert of pM22 into the EcoR site of pBluescript SK ( Stratagene ) ; the resulting construct was digested with NsiI ( site at bp 941 ) to yield an ~750-bp uniformly labeled probe covering 3 ' untranslated and 65 bp of coding sequence of alternative splice form B .
This probe did not cross-hybridize to sequences other than TCF-1 in the human and mouse genome under conditions of reduced stringency ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , as predicted from the structure of the human TCF-1 gene , this probe represented sequences present in all alternative TCF-1 mRNA species .
The probe size was reduced to 200-300 bp by limited hydrolysis in NaOH .
Expression of Murine TCFA1 in Escherichia coli .
E. coli strain N4830-1 was used as the host for expression of TCF-1 using the heat-inducible protein A expression vector pRIT2-T ( 24 ) .
100 ml of LB containing 100 ug/m| ampicillin was inoculated with 1 ml of an overnight culture , and grown at 30°C to Aso ~0.9 .
One volume LB of 54°C was added and the cells were grown at 42°C for 90 min .
Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min , and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of PBS containing 1 mM PMSF .
The bacteria were lysed by sonification ( four times for 4 min ) on ice .
Cell fragments were removed by centrifugation ( 10 min at 15,000 g ) .
The fusion protein was purified over IgG-Sepharose according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals ) and stored at -70°C .
All fusion protein batches were analyzed by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
Constructs used were : ( a ) pRIT-M2a , generated from pRIT-TCF-1A ( 16 ) by digestion with PstI and insertion of the PstI fragment of pM2a ( bp 586-1121 ) .
( b ) 3 ' deletion clones were generated by opening pRIT-M22 at the Nsil site ( bp 941 ) , followed by limited digestion with Bal31 exonuclease , and insertion of an oligonucleotide linker containing stop codons in all frames .
( c ) 5 ' deletions were generated by insertion of the Pst !
fragment of pM22 ( bp 586-1121 ) into pRIT2-T ( 24 ) , resulting in a 5° truncation , starting Murine T Cell-specific Transcription Factor at amino acid 133 ) ; and insertion of a fragment , generated from pM22 by PCR , into Smal/PstI-digested pRIT2-T , resulting in a truncation starting at amino acid 155 .
All constructs were sequenced to determine the deletion start/end points and to exclude PCR errors .
Methylation Interference Footprinting .
- MW el was labeled at the positive strand oligonucleotide with 7- [ P ] -ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase .
After annealing , the probe was purified over poly-acrylamide .
The labeled probe was partially methylated at purine residues using dimethylsulfate .
100,000 cpm of methylated probe was used in a scale-up of the gel retardation binding reaction .
After fractionation by gel retardation assay , the wet gel was subjected to autoradiography .
The bound and free probes were cut out and recovered by electroelution .
After cleavage by NaOH at G and A residues , the sequence was analyzed on a 10 % polyacrylamide-8 M urea sequencing gel .
Results Gel Retardation Analysis Indicates the Existence of a Murine TCF1 Homologue .
'To demonstrate the presence of a TCF-1-like binding activity in nuclear extracts from murine T cells , we performed gel retardation analysis with probe MWel ( which contains the cognate motif of human TCF-1 ) .
Analysis of nuclear extracts derived from a panel of murine cells resulted in the appearance of a retarded band that displayed the same sequence preference and T cell specificity as was observed with TCF-1 in human T cell extracts .
Fig .
1 depicts typical results obtained with extracts from the murine thymoma cell line El-4 , the murine B lineage cell line Ag-8 , and murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts , as compared with extracts of several human T and non-T cell lines .
The TCP-1 retardation band is indicated with a solid arrow .
No TCF-1-like binding was observed with probe MWe1Sac , in which the AAcAAAG motif is replaced by CCGCGGT ( data not shown ) .
Cloning of Murine TCF-1 .
A XZAP cDNA library was then prepared from the murine TCR/CD3+* EL4 thymoma cell line ( 105 primary recombinant phages , average insert size , 1.2 kb ) and amplified .
106 plaques were plated out and screened with the radiolabeled insert of @ TCF-1 , the original human TCPF-1 bacteriophage clone ( 16 ) .
10 positive plaques were isolated .
The phages could be divided into two groups based on restriction digests of their inserts .
The inserts of two representative phages , @ M22 and @ M5 , were subcloned in pUC19 , and the resulting plasmids ( pM2a and pM5 ) were sequenced .
Fig .
2 A depicts the sequence of the insert of pM22 .
By comparison with the human TCF-1 sequence , pM22 appeared to encode a full-length version of the TCF-1 protein , with a COOH terminus of the TCF-1B splice form ( 16 ) .
Overall sequence homology with human TCF-1B was 95.5 % at the amino acid level ( see Fig .
2 C ) .
An in-frame stop codon ( bp 13 ) was present upstream from the first in-frame ATG ( bp 190 ) and is indicated by a solid bar .
Comparison of the sequence of pM22 and pM5 revealed the presence of an extra stretch of 93 bp in pM2a starting at position 489 ( Fig .
2 A ) .
This stretch was inserted into the proline-rich domain of TCF-1 and itself encoded a proline-rich amino acid sequence ( see 1135 Oosterwegel et al .

Gel retardation analysis was performed with the TCF-1 cognate probe MWe1 in conjunction with nuclear extracts of various human and murine T and non-T cells .
The solid arrow indicates the position of TCF-1 from human and murine T cells .
The open arrow indicates the position of another ( ubiquitous ) DNA-binding protein unrelated to TCF-1 .

2 B : proline-rich alternative splice ) .
The site of inser-tion , marked with P in Fig .
2 A , coincided with exon-intron boundaries in the human TCF-1 gene ( M. van de Wetering , F. Holstege , and H. Clevers , manuscript in preparation ) , indicating that pM2a represented a genuine alternative splice ; it was not previously encountered among 34 independent human TCF-1 cDNA clones ( 16 ) .
From Northern blot anal-ysis , the principal murine TCF-1 mRNA was estimated to be ~2,900 bp ( see below ) .
Thus , pM22 lacked some 1,200 bp of 3 ' untranslated sequence .
The shorter clone M5 represented a splice alternative , which was termed TCF-1D and which we recently also isolated from human T cells ( MW .
and H. Clevers , unpublished results ) .
As compared with M2a , 23 bp were inserted near the COOH terminus of the encoded protein ( marked with D in Fig .
2 A ) .
The sequence of this stretch is given in Fig .

Recombinant Murine TCF1 Recognizes the AAcAAAG Motif .
- To investigate the binding specificity of murine TCF-1 , we generated a Staphylococcal protem fusion protein using the vector pRIT2-T in the appropriate E. colf host ( 24 ) .
The fusion protein was purified to near homogeneity by a single IgG-Sepharose chromatography step .
Gel retardation analysis performed with the purified murine TCF-1B fusion protein demonstrated specific binding to the MWe probe ( see Fig .

Subsequent methylation interference footprinting revealed that the positive strand contact bases of recombinant murine TCF-1 were identical to those of human TCF-1 ( indicated by a solid bar in Fig .

Under the experimental conditions , contacts with both A and G appear as spots of decreased intensity .
The HMG Box of TCFA Is Involved in Sequence-specific Binding .
To delineate the domain in TCF-1 that mediates recognition of the AAcAAAG motif , a set of deletion clones of murine TCF-1 was generated in the pRIT2Z-T vector by Bal31 and PCR techniques .
Fusion proteins were purified and subjected to gel retardation analysis using the cognate probe MWe1 and the negative control probe MWe1Sac .
Fig .

- Recombinant murine TCF-1 binds to the TCF-1 motif in the CD3-e enhancer .
( A ) Gel retardation analysis performed with recombinant murine TCF-1B ( M ) and human TCF-1A ( A ) resulted in a specific retardation band with probe MWef ( left , indicated with 56 ) , but not with the control probe MW e1Sac ( right , indicated with 56Sac ) .
No retarded bands were observed with control recombinant protein A ( P ) .

Essentially identical footprints were obtained for both proteins ( indicated with a bar , SAAcAAAG3 ' ) in comparison with the reaction performed on the free probe ( F ) .
Due to the paucity of purines in the relevant area of the negative strand of MW e1 , no contact bases could be defined by methylation interference on this strand ( 16 ) .

This region encompassed the 77-amino acid HMG box in TCF-1 ( amino acids 157-233 ) as delineated by sequence comparison with other members of the HMG box family ( 16 ) .
It should be noted that a 5° deletion clone starting at the NHz-terminal boundary ( amino acid 155 ) of the HMG box did not bind DNA .
It thus appeared that residues directly NH ; terminal to the HMG box ( but still located within the TCF-1 basic domain ; see Fig .
4 ) were indispensable for cognate interaction with the TCF-1 DNA motif .
However , we can not exclude the possibility that the loss of binding resulted from interference of the protein A fusion segment with an otherwise intact HMG box in this particular deletion mutant .

Expression of TCF-1 Is Confined to the T Cell Lineage .
Low stringency hybridization has revealed the presence of several sequences related to TCF-1 in the human and murine genomes ( H. Clevers , unpublished results ) .
Crosshybridization to TCF-1-like genes might therefore hamper expression analysis by Northern blotting at decreased stringency .
The availability of murine cDNA probes allowed examination of TCF-1 expression in various tissues of the mouse under conditions of high stringency .
RNA was prepared from 2-wk-old BALB/c mice , and Northern blotting was performed using a 3 ' untranslated TCF-1 probe .
A predominant 2.9-kb mRNA species , comparable with the size of human TCF-1 mRNA , was thus observed ( see Fig .
5 a ) .
TCF-1 mRNA was detected only in thymic and splenic RNA .
To investigate patterns of TCF-1 expression within the spleen and thymus , we performed in situ hybridization experiments on paraffin-embedded sections of these lymphoid organs .
In situ hybridization of spleen with an antisense S-labeled probe revealed that TCF-1 expression was limited to the periarteriolar lymphocyte sheaths ( PALS ) , the T cell areas of the spleen .
No signal was observed in red pulp , nor in the B cell follicles and marginal zone ( See Fig .
5 b ) .
In situ hybridization of thymus sections with the same probe demonstrated that TCF-1 was expressed throughout the thymus , with particularly high levels in the cortex ( Fig .
5 b ) .
In the same experiment , no signal was obtained with the nonrele-vant negative control probe S8 ( F. Meijlink , unpublished results ) on thymus and spleen sections ( data not shown ) .
TCF-1 Binds to a Functional Motif in the TCR- Enhancer .
Our experiments have demonstrated that TCF-1 controls the T cell-specific activity of the CD3-e enhancer ( 16 ; M. Oosterwegel and H. Clevers , unpublished results ) .
If TCF-1 were to play a more general role in T cell differentiation , it should control transcription of other T lymphocyte genes .
We therefore compared the TCF-1 footprint with functional motifs in other TCR and CD3 regulatory sequences ( 12 ) .
Homologies to sequences within promoters/enhancers not known to bind T cell-specific factors or to mediate T cell-specific transactivation were not included in the com-parison .
Two motifs were thus selected : the 6B element in the CD3-8 enhancer ( 25 ) , and the NFa3/TCF-1 @ element in the TCR- enhancer ( 26-29 ) .
The relevant oligonucleotide sequences are aligned in Fig .
6 A .
Specific binding of TCF-1 to the selected oligonucleotide probes was analyzed by gel retardation and competition with relevant and non-relevant oligonucleotide probes , performed both on recombinant TCF-1 and on crude nuclear extracts .
Fig .
6 B presents the results of a gel retardation experiment performed with the murine TCF-1B fusion protein and various oligonucleotide probes .
Strong binding was observed to the probes containing the TCF-1 and the NFa3/TCF-1 @ motifs ( probes MWe1 and MWTCF-1 @ , respectively ; Fig .
6 B , lanes 1 and 4 ) .
Slightly decreased binding was obtained with a mutant version of MWel , in which the A residue located 2 bp upstream of the TCR-1 footprint was replaced by a G ( MWe1A1G ; lane 2 ) .
No binding was observed to the mutant version of MW e1 , which lacked the TCF-1 motif HMG BOX 157 r————————————————~———-j 233 BASIC DOMAIN 137 l | 241 105 I 105 246 105 237 105 217 133 155 ( MWe1Sac ; lane 3 ) .
A very weak signal was obtained with the MWB probe , which contained the 8B motif ( MWB ; lane 5 ) .
No signal was observed with a probe representing bp 43-65 of the CD3-e enhancer ( reference 16 ; MWpal , lane @ U E A K M 1 G S $ T L F H BINDING + Figure 4 .

Specific competition was obtained with excess unlabeled MW e1 and MWTCF-1a .
No competition was seen with MW and MWB .
Essentially identical results were obtained in the reciprocal experiment ( Fig .

Similar experiments were conducted with crude nuclear extracts of the human T cell line Jurkat .
Fig .
6 D ( left ) demonstrates that the TCF-1 retarded band ( arrow ) obtained with probe MW e1 could be competed away by cold excess MWef and MWTCF-1 @ , but not by MW 56Sac , nor by MWB .
A band with similar migration characteristics was obtained with the MWTCEF-10 probe ( Fig .
6 D , right ) and probably represented binding of TCF-1 .
Again , this band was competed away specifically with cold excess MWe1 and with MWTCP-1 @ .
Taken together , these experiments indicated that TCF-1 bound specifically and with comparable affinities to both the NFa3/TCF-1a probe and to the TCF-1 motif of the CD3-e enhancer .
As summarized in Fig .
6 A , no significant binding was observed to the 6B element or to various control probes .
Discussion The present report describes the isolation and analysis of murine TCF-1 cDNA clones .
Comparison with human TCF-1 revealed a striking degree of homology , in particular in the COOH-terminal DNA-binding half of this transcription factor .
The two murine clones described in detail were homologues of the human alternative splice forms TCF-1B ( 16 ) and TCF-1D ( this report ) .
The proline-rich alternative exon identified in clone M2a defined a second position in TCF-1 where alternative splicing can occur , and it stressed the significance of the proline residues in the half of TCPF-1 .
We presently do not know what the differences in function are between these alternative splice forms .
Based on analogy to CTF/NF-1 ( 30 ) , the proline-rich NH -terminal segment of TCF-1 might constitute a transactivation domain .
Extension of the proline-rich domain by an insertional alternative exon could enhance or otherwise modulate transactivation as exerted by TCF-1 .
The alternative splices TCF-1A/B/C/D are located near , but ( as shown in the present study ) COOH terminal to the DNA-binding domain .
Indeed , the methylation interference footprints of human TCF-1A , -1B , and -1C were indistinguishable ( 16 ) .
Although the alternative COOH termini are therefore not involved in DNA binding , the complete conservation of human and murine TCF-1B and -1D suggests an important function for these segments .
Most likely , the alternative COOH termini provide surface for interaction with other proteins directly or indirectly bound to enhancer sequences .
TCF-1 belongs to a novel family of proteins containing an 80-amino acid motif , which , based on homology to HMG 1139 Oosterwegel et al .
I proteins , has been termed the HMG box ( 16-20 ) .
The only other protein with proven sequence-specific DNA-binding characteristics in this family is the polymerase I transcription factor UBF ( 17 ) .
UBF contains four HMG boxes , which are more or less evenly distributed over the length of the mole-cule .
A deletion mutant of UBF containing the first 204 residues and only one of the HMG boxes was still capable of binding DNA as assessed by binding to a DNA affinity column ; the deletion of 104 additional COOH-terminal amino acids removed this HMG box and abrogated DNA binding .
From this experiment , the HMG box was proposed to constitute a novel protein motif capable of sequence-specific DNA binding ( 17 ) .
The presence of a single HMG box in TCF-1 in conjunction with its well-defined recognition motif allowed a direct assessment of the contribution of the TCF-1 HMG box to sequence-specific DNA binding .
Our deletion analysis demonstrated that a segment of TCF-1 , containing the HMG box plus a short stretch of basic residues directly NH terminal to this box , was sufficient to mediate binding .
The future identification of DNA sequence motifs recognized by other members of the HMG box family will allow , by means of sequence comparison and `` domain swapping `` , the identification of critical residues in ( and around ) the DNA-binding HMG box domain .
Our recognition of a DNA-binding HMG box in a polymerase II transcription factor has important implications for other members in this family , in particular for the candidate mammalian sex-determining gene SRY ( 18 ) and for the S. pombe and N. crassa mating type genes ( 19 , 20 ) .
It is likely that these genes , like TCF-1 , encode polymerase II transcription factors ; they could thus govern sexual differentiation ( of mammals , yeast , and fungus , respectively ) by direct binding to regulatory sequences of target genes .
We originally identified TCF-1 as a DNA-binding activity present uniquely in nuclear extracts of T lineage cells within a panel of 15 cell lines .
The present study extends this obser-vation : Northern blot analysis of mouse tissue RNA showed that TCF-1 mRNA expression was confined to tissues of lymphoid origin .
By in situ hybridization , it was subsequently found that TCF-1 was expressed throughout the thymus and in the T cell areas of the spleen .
These results indicate that TCF-1 expression is indeed T cell specific , and is initiated early in the T cell differentiation pathway , coinciding with or possibly preceding expression of the CD3 genes ( 15 ) .
We can not exclude at present that TCF-1 is expressed in other tissues during embryogenesis , or in cells that occur in relatively low numbers in an adult animal .
In situ hybridization experiments are currently being conducted to investigate these possibilities .
The expression pattern of TCF-1 is suggestive of its involvement in T cell differentiation .
If indeed TCF-1 were a regulator of T cell differentiation , it should control the expression of other genes that build the mature T cell phenotype .
As demonstrated here , recombinant TCF-1 was capable of binding to a functional motif in the TCR-a enhancer , which has been termed NFo3 in the murine enhancer ( 26 ) , and Ta2 ( 27 , 28 ) and TCF-1 @ ( 29 ) in the human enhancer .

1140 Murine T Cell-specific Transcription Factor D 1 2 3 4 501 2 3 4 5 have been defined by DNasel footprinting .
The NF3 and TCF-1a « DNA-binding factors are T cell specific and appear to be homologues of the same factor .
The Tax3 motif probably represents a composite footprint of NF « 3/TCF-1 @ with a second T cell-specific DNA-binding protein ( 28 , 29 ) .
It is highly likely that the TCF-1 , as present in T cell nuclear extracts , is responsible for the NFa « 3/TCF-1i « T cell-specific DNasel footprint ( 27 ) .
Recently , Waterman and Jones ( 29 ) have purified a T cell-specific DNA-binding protein , TCF-1a , that binds to the NFa3 motif .
By analyzing the affinity of this protein for a panel of double-stranded DNA molecules , they formulated a consensus binding site : CTNTG ( or CANAG ) for this protein .
Although this consensus appears too degenerate to describe the sequence preference of a biologically relevant transcription factor , it fits the TCF-1 ’ ~ hup v # motif ( AAcAAAG ) .
The cloning of TCF-1 @ has been announced ( 29 ) ; we anticipate that sequence comparison will reveal TCF-1 @ to be identical to human TCPF-1 .
TCF-1 thus appears to be involved in the transcriptional control of at least two T cell genes : CD3-e and TCR- .
In the analysis of a set of prothymocyte cell lines , TCF-1 expression was strictly concordant with CD3-e expression ( M. Oosterwegel , A. Kruisbeek , and H. Clevers , unpublished results ) .
However , several of the cell lines containing TCF-1 do not express TCR- .
Moreover , the human leukemic T cell line CCRF-CEM expresses TCF-1 and CD3-e but similarly does not express TCR- , despite the presence of a productively rearranged TCR- locus ( 16 , 31 ) .
This suggests that TCF-1 expression might be sufficient for CD3-e expression by differentiating thymocytes , but that TCR- expression requires the presence of additional stage-specific transcription factors .
We propose the existence of a set of genes controlling T cell differentiation , possibly in a cascade-like fashion .
For the expression of individual structural T cell genes , different combinations of these differentiation control genes act in concert with more ubiquitous transcription factors .
The combinato-rial activity of a few T cell-specific transcription factors , each appearing at a particular stage of T cell differentiation , can thus explain the intricate molecular events that accompany T cell differentiation .
