In this study , we examined the molecular mechanism by which agents that elevate intracellular cAMP inhibit the expression of the tumor necrosis factor a ( TNFa ) , tissue factor , endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 , and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 genes .
Both forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP , which elevate intracellular cAMP by independent mechanisms , inhibited TNFa and tissue factor expression at the level of transcription .
Induction of NF- « B-dependent gene expression in transiently transfected human monocytic THP-1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was inhibited by elevated cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A ( PKA ) .
Elevated cAMP did not prevent nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers , decrease nuclear translocation of p65 , or significantly modify TNFa-induced phosphorylation of p65 .
Functional studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation of a plasmid containing multimerized « B sites by p65 was inhibited by agents that elevate cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA .
This study indicates that activation of PKA reduces the induction of a distinct set of genes in monocytes and endothelial cells by inhibiting NF- « B-mediated transcription .
Human monocytes and endothelial cells can be induced to express a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses , cell adhesion , blood coagulation , and fibrinoly-sis ( 1 , 2 ) .

* The abbreviations used are : LPS , lipopolysaccharide ; TNF # , tumor necrosis factor a ; TF , tissue factor ; E-selectin , endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 ; VCAM-1 , vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ; ICAM-1 , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ; PKA , protein kinase A ; stimulates monocytic cells to rapidly and transiently express a defined set of gene products including tumor necrosis factor « ( TNFa ) ( 3 ) and the transmembrane receptor tissue factor ( TF ) ( 4 , 5 ) .
In endothelial cells , LPS and cytokines induce the expression of various adhesion molecules , including endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 ( E-selectin ) , vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , which permit binding and transmigration of leukocytes into sites of inflammation ( 6-8 ) .
Activation of endothelial cells also induces TF expression , which converts the normal anticoagulant surface to a procoagulant state ( 9-11 ) .
The NF- « B/Rel family of transcription factors has been implicated in the inducible expression of many genes in monocytes and endothelial cells , including TNFa , TF , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 ( 12-15 ) .
The NF- « B/Re !
l family of transcription factors includes NFKB1 ( p50 ) , NFKB2 ( p52 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , RelB , and c-Rel ( 16 ) .
These factors can homo- and heterodimerize to generate distinct transcription factors that regulate expression of many different genes ( 16 ) .
The TNFa , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 genes are regulated by p50/p65 heterodimers ( 17 ) , whereas the TF gene is regulated by c-Rel/p65 heterodimers ( 18 ) .
In monocytes and endothelial cells , LPS and cytokines induce the dissociation of the inhibitory protein IxBa from pre-existing cytoplasmic NF- « B : Rel complexes , allowing the transcription factors to translocate to the nucleus and initiate expression of target genes ( 19 ) .
cAMP induces the expression of numerous genes through the protein kinase A ( PKA ) mediated phosphorylation of CRE-binding factors , including CRE-binding protein ( CREB ) ( 20 ) .
Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels in monocytes and endothelial cells also inhibits the induction of a distinct set of genes , including TNFa , TF , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 ( 21-25 ) .
We ( 27 ) and others ( 26 , 28 ) have shown that pharmacologic agents that elevate intracellular levels of cAMP , such as pentoxifylline and a prostacyclin analog , iloprost , inhibit LPS induction of TF expression in human monocytes .
In addition , agents such as dibutyryl cAMP ( Bt , cAMP ) , forskolin , and isobutylmethylxan-thine , which increase cAMP levels by independent mechanisms , all inhibit induction of TF expression ( 29 , 30 ) .
In endothelial cells , elevation of cAMP and activation of PKA inhibit cytokine induction of E-selectin , VCAM-1 , and TF expression ( 21 , 22 , 31 ) .
Studies using both monocytes and endothelial cells indicate that cAMP inhibits transcription of this distinct set of genes ( 21 , 23 , 25 , 30 ) .
This study examined inhibition of the transcriptional activa- tion of the TNFa , TF , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 genes in human CRE , cAMP response element ; Bt , cAMP , dibutyryl cAMP ; HUVECs , human umbilical vein endothelial cells ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase ; TA , transactivation ; CREB , CRE-binding protein .

RESULTS Elevated cAMP Inhibits LPS and TNFa Induction of a Distinct Set of Genes in Human Monocytic and Endothelial Cells-The effect of elevated intracellular levels of cAMP on LPS induction of the TF and TNFa genes in human monocytic THP-1 cells was investigated using Bt , cAMP , a membrane-permeable analog of cAMP ( 30 ) , or forskolin , an activator of adenylyl cyclase ( 21 ) .
The reagent concentration used in this study has been previously shown to increase cAMP levels in monocytes/macrophages and HUVECs ( 21 , 25 ) .
LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells increased the steady-state levels of TF and TNFa mRNAs at 2 h ( Fig .
14 ) .
The addition of immediately before LPS stimulation abolished induction of TF and TNFa mRNA expression .
In addition , Bt , cAMP reduced TF and TNFa mRNA levels in unstimulated cells .
In contrast , Bt , cAMP induced expression of c-fos mRNA in THP-1 cells , indicating that Bt , cAMP activates PKA ( Fig .
14 ) .
TNFa stimulation of HUVECs increased the steady-state levels of TF , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 mRNAs at 1 h ( Fig .
1B ) .
Pretreatment of HUVECs with forskolin before the addition of TNFa inhibited the induction of TF , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 mRNAs by 60 + 9 , 78 + 8 , and 73 + 14 % , respectively ( mean * S8.D .
, n = 3 ) .
In contrast , forskolin did not inhibit TNFa induction of ICAM-1 mRNA ( data not shown ) , consistent with previous studies ( 21 , 22 ) .
These data indicate that agents that increase intracellular levels of cAMP by two independent mechanisms inhibit the induction of a distinct set of genes in human monocytic and endothelial cells .
Elevated cAMP Inhibits LPS Induction of TNFa Gene Transcription in Monocytic Cells-We examined the effect of Bta , cAMP on LPS-induced TNFa gene transcription in monocytic THP-1 cells using nuclear run-on assays .
LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells increased the rate of transcription of the TNFa gene by 11.7-fold at 1 h ( Fig .
2 ) .
Treatment of the cells with Bt , cAMP before the addition of LPS abolished the increase in the rate of transcription of the TNFa gene ( Fig .
2 ) .
These results indicate that cAMP inhibition of transcription may account for most , if not all , of the observed inhibition of LPS-induced TNFa mRNA expression .
Elevated cAMP Inhibits TNFa Induction of TF Promoter Activity in Endothelial Cells-The human TF promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene was used as a model system to examine inhibition of promoter activity in THP-1 cells and HUVECs by Bt , cAMP and forskolin .

Elevated cAMP inhibits LPS-induced TNFa gene transcription .
Nuclei were isolated from unstimulated THP-1 cells , cells stimulated with LPS ( 10 ug/ml ! )
for 1 h , and cells treated with Bt , cAMP ( dbcAMP ; 1 mM ) before LPS stimulation .
Labeled nuclear RNA levels were determined by hybridization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G3PDH ) and TNFa cDNAs and a vector control ( pSP73 ) .
The autoradiogram was exposed for 12 days at -80 °C with an intensifier screen .
Similar results were observed in two independent experiments .
indicated that Bt ; cAMP alone induced TF promoter activity ( data not shown ) , suggesting that these plasmids contain cryptic CRE sites .
In addition , cAMP and cAMP derivatives have been shown to interfere with the luciferase assay ( 38 ) .
There-fore , we employed a two-plasmid reporter system in which the first plasmid contained the human TF promoter expressing a tet/VP16 transcription factor that transactivates a promoter driving expression of the CAT reporter gene present on a second plasmid , pUHG10.3CAT ( 21 ) .
This two-plasmid reporter system had two advantages : ( i ) pUHG10.3CAT has been shown not to contain any cryptic CRE sites that influence expression of CAT activity ( 21 ) ; and ( ii ) it can be used to study weak promoters , such as the TF promoter , because the promoter activity is amplified by expression of the tet/VP16 transcription factor .
TF promoter activity was increased by 4.3 + 1.1-fold ( mean *+ S.E .
, n = 3 ) by TNFa stimulation in transiently transfected HUVECs ( Fig .
3 ) .
Treatment of the cells with forskolin before TNFa stimulation inhibited the induction of TF promoter activity by 44 + 3 % ( mean + S.E .
, n = 3 ) .
Forskolin alone did not significantly affect TF promoter activity .
In addition , TNFa or forskolin did not affect the level of CAT expression in cells transfected with the promoterless control plasmid pBasic-tet/VP16 ( Fig .
3 ) .
Similarly , Bt , cAMP ( 1 mm ) strongly inhibited LPS induction of TF promoter activity in transiently transfected THP-1 cells ( data not shown ) .

Elevated cAMP inhibits the induction of the TF promoter in HUVECs .
HUVECs were cotransfected with pBasic-tet/VP16 ( pBasic ; 10 ug ) and pUHG10.3CAT ( 10 ug ) or with pTF-tet/VP16 ( pTF ; 10 ug ) and pUHG10.3CAT ( 10 ug ) using DEAE-dextran .
After 24 h , cells were stimulated with TNFa ( 20 ng/ml ) with or without a 20-min pretreatment with forskolin ( Fsk ; 50 uM ) and incubated for a further 24 h before determining CAT activity .
Results from three independent experiments are shown .
Transfection efficiencies were assessed using pCMV $ and exhibited < 15 % variation between samples .
pression of the TF , TNFa , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 genes ( 12-15 ) .
Elevated cAMP may inhibit all of these genes by a common mechanism involving NF- « B/Rel proteins .
To determine if elevation of cAMP inhibited NF- « B-mediated induction of gene transcription , THP-1 cells and HUVECs were transfected with pSV40-tet/VP16 or p ( « B ) , -tet/VP16 , which contains four « B sites cloned upstream of the minimal SV40 promoter .
LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells transfected with p ( « B ) , -tet/VP16 resulted in a 5.0 + 0.7-fold ( mean + S.E .

Similar results were observed using a plasmid containing four copies of the murine Igx- « B site ( data not shown ) .

Elevated cAMP inhibits NF- « B-mediated gene transcription in THP-1 cells and HUVECs .
A , pSV40-tet/VP16 ( pSV40 ; 5 ug ) or p ( « B ) , tet/VP16 ( p ( xB ) , , ; 5 ug ) was cotransfected with pUHG10.3CAT ( 5 ug ) into THP-1 cells using DEAE-dextran .
After 24 h , cells were divided in four equal portions and exposed to LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) for 24 h in the presence or absence of Bt , cAMP ( dbeAMP ; 1 mM ) as indicated .
B , HUVECs were cotransfected with pSV40-tet/VP16 ( pSV40 ; 10 ug ) or p ( « B ) , -tet/VP16 ( p ( « B ) , ; 10 ug ) and pUHG10.3CAT ( 10 ug ) .
After 24 h , cells were stimulated with TNFa ( 20 ng/ml ) for 24 h with or without a 20-min pretreatment with forskolin ( sk ; 50 uM ) .
Transfection efficiencies were assessed using pCMV $ B and exhibited < 15 % variation between samples .
Results from five independent experiments are shown .
These data demonstrate that agents that elevate cAMP strongly inhibit NF- « B-mediated gene transcription in human monocytic and endothelial cells .
Nuclear Translocation of NF-kB / Rel Proteins Is Not Affected by Elevated cAMP-Inhibition of NF- « B-mediated transcription may be due to a block in the nuclear translocation of NF- « B/Rel proteins and/or a reduction in the transcriptional activity of these proteins in the nucleus .
To examine the effect of an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP on the nuclear translocation of these NF- « B-Rel complexes , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a « kB site from the murine Igx enhancer , which binds p50/p65 heterodimers , and a « B site from the human TF gene , which binds c-Rel/p65 heterodimers ( 34 ) .
Previous competition and antibody supershift experiments have established the protein composition of these complexes ( 11 , 34 ) .
Binding of nuclear proteins to these « B sites in THP-1 cells was examined 1 h after stimulation because the maximal rate of transcription of the TF and TNFa genes was previously shown to occur 1 h after LPS stimulation ( 8 , 5 ) .
LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells for 1 h induced the nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers that bound the Igk- « B and TF- « B sites , respectively ( Fig .

A , nuclear extracts were prepared from THP-1 cells incubated for 1 h with LPS ( 10 ug/ml ) in the presence or absence of Bt , cAMP ( dbeAMP ; 1 mM ) or forskolin ( Fsk ; 50 um ) .
B , nuclear extracts were prepared from HUVECs stimulated for 1 h with TNFa ( 20 ng/ml ) with or without a 20-min pretreatment with forskolin ( 100 pM ) .
The presence of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the murine Igx- « B site and TF- « B site , respectively .
The faster migrating band represents nonspecific protein binding ( 84 ) .
Similar results were observed in two independent experiments .
significant differences were observed between the levels of p50/65 ( p < 0.49 ) and c-Rel/p65 ( p < 0.20 ) heterodimers in nuclear extracts from cells treated with LPS in the presence and absence of Nuclear extracts from unstimulated THP-1 cells and Bt , cAMP-treated cells showed no binding of NF- « B-Rel complexes ( Fig .
5A ) .
The TF , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 genes are rapidly and transiently expressed in endothelial cells ( 6 , 11 , 17 ) .
Binding of nuclear proteins from HUVECs was examined 1 h after stimulation because transcription of these genes is increased at this time ( 11 , 17 ) .
TNFa stimulation of HUVECs induced the nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers ( Fig .
5B ) .
The addition of forskolin to HUVECs before TNFa stimulation had no effect on the nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers ( Fig .
5B ) .
No statistically significant differences were observed between the levels of p50/p65 ( p < 0.44 ) and c-Rel/p65 ( p < 0.14 ) in nuclear extracts from cells treated with TNFa in the presence and absence of forskolin .
Forskolin alone did not induce the nuclear translocation of NF- « B-Rel complexes in HUVECs ( Fig .
5B ) .
Similarly , forskolin did not inhibit the nuclear translocation of p50/p65 induced by LPS stimulation of HUVECs ( data not shown ) .
Antibody supershift experiments indicated that elevated cAMP did not change the composition of the p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 het-erodimeric complexes ( data not shown ) .
In addition , antibody supershift experiments using an anti-CREB antibody excluded the possibility that elevation of cAMP induced binding of CREB to the NF- « B-Rel complexes ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that Bt , cAMP and forskolin do not affect either the nuclear translocation or DNA binding of NF- « B : Rel complexes in monocytic and endothelial cells .

To confirm that elevated cAMP did not selectively inhibit the nuclear translocation of p65 , cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells were examined by Western blotting using a p65-specific antibody .
LPS stimulation induced the nuclear translocation of p65 ( Fig .
6A ) .
Treatment of the cells with Bt , cAMP did not affect the nuclear translocation of p65 .
Similarly , preincubation of HUVECs for 20 min with forskolin ( 20 mx ) had no effect on the TNFa-induced nuclear translocation of p65 at 15 min ( data not shown ) .
To determine if elevated cAMP affected IxBa proteolysis , IxBa levels in cytoplasmic extracts from HUVECs were analyzed by Western blotting .
TNFa induced the proteolytic degradation of IxBa ( Fig .

Pretreatment of the cells with various doses of forskolin ( 20-200 um ) did not significantly reduce the proteolytic degradation of IkxBa ( Fig .
6B ) .
Similarly , Bt , cAMP ( 1 mym ) did not affect the proteolytic degradation of IxBa in THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS for 1 h ( data not shown ) .
TNFa-induced Phosphorylation of p65 Is Not Affected by Elevated cAMP-A recent study showed that p65 is strongly phosphorylated during the activation of NF-kB in vivo ( 39 ) .
More detailed studies indicated that p65 contains two transactivation ( TA ) domains in the carboxyl-terminal end ( 40 ) .
TAq is constitutively phosphorylated , whereas stimulation of cells induces phosphorylation of TA ; and is correlated with increased transcriptional activity ( 40 ) .
To determine if elevated cAMP inhibited the functional activity of nuclear NF- « B-Rel complexes by modifying the phosphorylation of p65 , we examined the phosphorylation of p65 in TNFa-stimulated HUVECs with or without forskolin .
p65 was immunoprecipitated from unlabeled HUVECs and detected by Western blotting using an anti-p65 antibody to confirm selective recovery of p65 ( data not shown ) .
In addition , immunoprecipitation of p65 was prevented by the addition of the peptide ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) that was used to raise the antibody ( data not shown ) .

TNFa-induced phosphorylation of p65 in HUVECs .
Phosphate-labeled HUVECs were stimulated with TNFa ( 10 ng/m ! )
for 1 h with or without a 20-min pretreatment with forskolin ( Fsk ; 20 um ) .
Phosphorylated p65 was recovered by immunoprecipitation and analyzed on an 8-16 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel , followed by autoradiography .
Similar results were observed in an independent experiment .
affected by pretreatment of the cells with forskolin ( Fig .
7 ) .
A low constitutive phosphorylation of p65 was observed in unstimulated HUVECs , which was not increased by treatment of the cells with forskolin alone ( Fig .
7 ) .
Additional phosphorylated proteins observed in these studies may represent commu-noprecipitation of other NF- « B/Rel proteins associated with p65 as shown previously ( 39 ) .
These data indicate that activation of PKA does not modify the TNFa « -induced phosphorylation of p65 , although we can not exclude the possibility that forskolin changes the sites of phosphorylation of p65 .
NF-kB-mediated Transcription Is Inhibited by Elevated cAMP and by Activation of PKA-The effect of increased levels of intracellular cAMP and expression of the catalytic subunit of PKA on NF- « B-mediated transcription was measured in HUVECs .
Cells were cotransfected with p ( « B ) , -tet/VP16 , pUHG10.3CAT , and pCMVp65 .
Expression of p65 increased the transcriptional activity of p ( « B ) , -tet/VP16 by 22.1 + 1.3-fold ( mean + S.E .
, n = 3 ) ( Fig .
8A ) , but did not affect the transcriptional activity of the control plasmid , pSV40-tet/VP16 ( data not shown ) .
Forskolin reduced the level of p65 transactivation by 74 + 10 % ( mean + S.E .
, n = 3 ) ( Fig .
8A ) .
To exclude the possibility that forskolin nonspecifically reduced transcription of the cytomegalovirus promoter , which was used to express p65 , we determined CAT activity in the presence and absence of forskolin in HUVECs transfected with pCMV-tet/ VP16 , which expresses the tet/VP16 transcription factor from the cytomegalovirus promoter .
Forskolin did not affect cytomegalovirus promoter activity as measured by the level of CAT activity ( Fig .
8A ) .
To determine if activation of PKA was required to inhibit NF- « B-mediated transcription , we examined the TNFa induction of CAT activity in HUVECs overexpressing the catalytic subunit of PKA .
HUVECs were cotransfected with p ( « B ) , -tet/ VP16 , pUHG10.3CAT , and pPKA , which expresses the catalytic subunit of PKA .
Expression of PKA inhibited the TNFa induction of CAT activity by 69 + 8 % ( mean + S.E .
, n = 3 ) ( Fig .

To determine if activation of PKA inhibited p65 transactivation , HUVECs were cotransfected with p ( « B ) , -tet/VP16 , pUHG10.3CAT , and pCMVp65 in the presence and absence of pPKA .
p65 transactivation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by coexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA ( Fig .
8C ) .
Expression of maximal levels of PKA inhibited p65 transactivation by 75 + 10 % ( mean + S.E .
, n » = 3 ) .
These data indicate that activation of PKA either by an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP or by expression of the catalytic subunit of PKA inhibits transcription mediated by endogenous NF- « B-Rel complexes or by overexpressed p65 .

t - o iL TNFa - = + + PKA DISCUSSION In this study , we demonstrated that activation of PKA by agents that elevate cAMP in human monocytic and endothelial cells inhibited the expression of a distinct set of NF- « B/Rel-regulated genes , including TNF « , TF , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 .
A common inhibitory mechanism was identified that involved reduction in NF- « B-mediated transcription .
Our studies demonstrated that nuclear translocation of NF- « B-Rel complexes was not affected by elevated cAMP .
In addition , forskolin did not modify the TNFa-induced phosphorylation of p65 .
However , transactivation by p65 was inhibited by activation of endogenous PKA and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA .
These data indicate that activation of PKA reduced NF- « B-mediated transcription in human monocytic and endothelial cells .
Our studies show that elevation of cAMP by both Bt , cAMP and forskolin inhibited the functional activity of endogenous NF- « B-Rel complexes in human monocytic and endothelial cells .
A recent study also showed that forskolin inhibits NF- « B-mediated transcription in HUVECs ( 21 ) .
Inhibition of NF- « B-mediated transcription may be due to a block in the nuclear translocation of NF- « B-Rel complexes and/or a reduction in the transcriptional activity of these proteins in the nucleus .
Here , we showed that agents that elevate cAMP did not affect the nuclear translocation of NF- « B/Re !
l proteins or proteolytic degradation of I « Ba .
Similarly , two recent reports indicated that forskolin does not reduce the nuclear translocation of NF- « B in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells and HUVECs ( 21 , 41 ) .
Forskolin and Bt , cAMP did not alter the composition of the NF- « B-Rel complexes or induce the binding of CRE-binding protein to the NF- « B-Rel complexes ( data not shown ) .
Instead , we p ( « B ) 4 p ( xB ) 4 demonstrated that elevation of cAMP or expression of the catalytic subunit of PKA strongly inhibited transcription mediated by endogenous NF- « B-Rel complexes and overexpressed p65 .
A recent study using Jurkat T-cells suggested that cAMP inhibition of interleukin-2 gene expression is due to a small change in the amount of I « Ba , which selectively decreases the nuclear translocation of p65 ( 42 ) .
It should be noted that nuclear translocation of NF- « B and p65 in Jurkat T-cells did not appear to be affected 40 min after stimulation , which is similar to our studies using monocytic and endothelial cells ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) , and only a small change was noted 2 h after stimulation ( 42 ) .
Functional studies using a chimeric Gal4-p65 protein , which contains the transactivation domain of p65 , indicated that forskolin did not inhibit transactivation by Gal4-p65 in human E14 T lymphoma cells ( 42 ) .
However , the use of Gal4-binding sites and a chimeric protein in place of « B-binding sites and wild-type p65 may not recapitulate cAMP-mediated inhi-bition .
The use of different cell types may account for these different inhibitory mechanisms .
Alternatively , costimulation of Jurkat cells and E14 T-cells with phorbol ester and ionomy-cin rather than LPS or cytokines may explain these differences .
Our study and those of others ( 21 , 22 , 25 ) have shown that elevated cAMP in monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells selectively inhibits the induction of a distinct set of genes .
In contrast , elevated cAMP does not inhibit other inducible genes such as ICAM-1 and interleukin-1 ( 21 , 22 , 25 ) .
Interest-ingly , induction of the ICAM-1 gene in endothelial cells is regulated , at least in part , by NF- « B/Rel proteins ( 17 ) .
However , inhibition of TNFa-induced nuclear translocation of NF- « B in HUVECs by aspirin reduces VCAM-1 and E-selectin 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 20834 expression without affecting ICAM-1 expression ( 43 ) .
In addition , unlike VCAM-1 , E-selectin , and TF , ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed by HUVECs , and induction of ICAM-1 is delayed compared with these other genes ( 17 ) , suggesting that the ICAM-1 gene is regulated by a different combination of transcription factors .
Elevated cAMP may also regulate the activity of other transcription factors that are required for expression of the TNFa , TF , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 genes .
In monocytic THP-1 cells , Bt , cAMP abolished LPS induction of TNFa and TF mRNA expression and TNFa gene transcription , but only partially inhibited NF- « B-mediated transcription in transfected cells , suggesting the possibility that cAMP may inhibit other transcription factors .
Changes in the composition of proteins binding to the CRE/ATF site in the E-selectin promoter have been reported to contribute to the cAMP inhibition of the E-selectin gene in bovine aortic endothelial cells ( 44 ) .
The TNFa and TF promoters contain AP-1 sites that contribute to the induction of these genes ( 13 , 45 , 46 ) .
We can not exclude the possibility that elevated cAMP may , in part , reduce TNFa and TF gene transcription by modulating protein binding to these AP-1 sites and/or by inhibiting AP-1 activity .
Our preliminary studies indicate that cAMP increases protein binding to both AP-1 sites in the TF promoter , but so far , no changes in protein composition have been detected . ``
Further studies are required to determine if cAMP inhibits expression of this distinct set of genes via multiple mechanisms .
PKA can modulate the activity of a number of intracellular signaling pathways ( 47 ) .
In yeast , the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor ADR1 inactivates its transcriptional activity without altering its binding to DNA ( 48 , 49 ) .
In our studies , PKA may directly phosphorylate p65 or initiate a signaling cascade involving other kinases that reduce the functional activity of NF- « B-Rel complexes .
Indeed , c-Rel , p65 , and p50 all contain a conserved serine in a consensus PKA recognition site ( X-Arg-Arg-X-Ser-X ) near the carboxyl-terminal end of the ref homology domain ( 50 ) .
However , the role of this PKA site is unclear because it is not present in all NF- « B/ Rel proteins .
Mutation of serine 266 to alanine in c-Rel reduces DNA binding and transactivation , suggesting that serine 266 contributes to protein dimerization ( 50 ) .
Similarly , mutation of serine 276 to alanine in p65 abolished its transactivation activity in HUVECs , making it impossible to determine if elevated cAMP inhibited NF- « B activity by direct phosphorylation of the consensus PKA site of p65 . ``
Phorbol ester-dependent phosphorylation of the TAs transactivation domain of p65 enhances its transactivating activity , suggesting that phorbol ester-activated protein kinase C directly phosphorylates TA ; on serine residues ( 40 ) .
We showed that forskolin did not modify the TNFa-induced phosphorylation of nuclear p65 in HUVECs .
However , changes in the phosphorylation pattern of p65 would not be detected in this experiment .
PKA may modulate NF- « B activity by phosphorylating cofactors that are required for transactivation .
Alternatively , cAMP may induce the synthesis or activation of transcriptional inhibitors of NF- « B-mediated transcription such as Bel3 ( 51 , 52 ) and p202 , which has recently been shown to inhibit NF- « B enhancers ( 53 ) .
Finally , activation of the PKA signaling pathway may inhibit NF- « B-mediated transcription by squelching coactivators .
Pharmacologic agents that elevate cellular levels of cAMP , such as pentoxifylline and rolipram , have been observed to inhibit LPS-induced TNFa and TF gene transcription in mono 2 V. Ollivier and N. Mackman , unpublished data .

Cyclic AMP Inhibition of Transcription cytes in vitro ( 27 , 54 , 55 ) .
In addition , pentoxifylline markedly inhibits increases in the levels of TNFa and TF in vivo in a chimpanzee model of endotoxemia ( 56 ) .
Other drugs such as rolipram and amrinone suppress T-cell activation in vitro and may be beneficial agents in the treatment of autoimmune en-cephalomyelitis and acute cardiac allographt rejection ( 57 , 58 ) .
Thus , elevation of cellular cAMP in vivo may reduce induction of gene expression and inflammation associated with a variety of diseases .
