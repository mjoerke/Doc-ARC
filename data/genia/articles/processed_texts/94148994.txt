Human Interferon Regulatory Factor 2 Gene INTRON-EXON ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF 5-FLANKING REGION®* ( Received for publication , May 26 , 1993 , and in revised form , September 28 , 1993 ) Ying Cha and Albert B. Deisserotht From the Department of Hematology , the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , Texas 77030 Interferon regulatory factor 2 ( IRF-2 ) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that terminates interferon B expression initiated by interferon regulatory factor 1 .
In this study , we isolated the genomic DNA for human IRF-2 gene , determined the intron-exon structure of the human IRF-2 gene , mapped the major transcription initiation site , identified a number of potential regulatory elements in the 5'-flanking region , and localized the IRF-2 gene on human chromosome 4 .
The IRF-2 promoter region contains a CpG island , with several GC boxes , a putative NF- « B-binding site , and a CAAT box , but no TATA box .
When the promoter region was linked with a heterologous reporter gene , we found that the promoter region is inducible by both interferons ( inter-feron-a « and -y ) and interferon regulatory factor 1 .
The region which induced these inductions was identified as being confined to 40 nucleotides 5 to the major transcriptional initiation site by testing a series of clones with truncated promoter of IRF-2 .
This region contains elements which are shared with the transcriptional en-hancers of other genes including interferon regulatory factor 1 , interferon $ , and interferon-inducible genes .
These data suggest that interferon regulatory factor 1 not only triggers the activation of the interferon signal transduction pathway , but also may play a role in limiting the duration of this response by activating the transcription of IRF-2 .
The expression of type I interferons ( interferon- « and - $ ) is regulated by several proteins through direct and indirect DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions ( Weissmann and Weber , 1986 ; Goodbourn , 1990 ) .
Interferon regulatory factor 2 ( IRF-2 ) `` is a transcriptional regulatory protein which limits the duration of the transcriptional activation of type I interferon genes ( Harada et al .

Other investigators have proposed that IRF-2 is bound to the promoter of the type I interferon genes in unstimulated cells , and that upon exposure of cells to certain stimuli , IRF-2 is displaced by activated interferon regulatory factor 1 ( IRF-1 ) , which initiates the interferon gene expression ( Harada ef al .
, 1989 , 1990 ; Watanabe et al .
, 1991 ; Palombella and Maniatis , 1992 ) .
These stimuli include viruses , double-stranded RNA , interferons , and other cytokines or inducers of certain signal transduction pathways , e.g .
interleukin-1 , interleukin-6 , leukemia inhibitory factor , tumor necrosis factor , prolactin , and phorbol ester ( Miyamoto et al .
, 1988 ; Fujita et al .
, 1989 ; Harada et al .

, 1990 ; Abdol-lahi et al .
, 1991 ; Watanabe et al .
, 1991 ; Harroch et al .
, 1993 ) .
It has been reported by Harada et al .
( 1989 ) that the level of IRF-2 mRNA increases 4-6 h after induction by interferon- and 6-9 h after induction by virus , as detected by S1 mapping analysis .
The increased level of IRF-2 product generated after induction could compete with IRF-1 for binding to the PRDI site on the promoter , thus terminating interferon production ( Weissmann and Weber , 1986 ; Harada et al .
, 1989 , 1990 ; Goodbourn , 1990 ; Palombella and Maniatis , 1992 ) .
The cDNAs for mouse and human IRF-2 have been isolated by Harada et al .
( 1989 ) and Itoh et al .
( 1989 ) , respectively .
In this report we describe the isolation of genomic DNA encoding human IRF-2 , and the identification of the promoter region that confers expression of IRF-2 .
These data provide information on the function and regulation of IRF-2 and deepen our understanding of the regulation of interferon and interferon-stimulated gene ( ISG ) expression .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Screening Genomic Libraries-Genomic DNA libraries derived from a human placenta and a human leukocyte ( Clontech Laboratories , Inc. ) were plated at 1 x 10° phages/plate ( 20 x 150-mm plates ) .
Duplicate nitrocellulose filters ( Schleicher & Schuell , Inc. ) containing phage DNA were hybridized with °P-IRF-2 cDNA as described by Cha et al .
( 1992 ) .
The following cDNA fragments were prepared by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and used as additional probes for screening of the IRF-2 gene .
For detection of the 5'-end of the ZRF-2 gene , the sequence +10 to +102 base pairs ( bp ) ( with respect to the major transcription initiation site ) was amplified .
To detect exons 6 and 7 , the sequence +530 to +753 bp was prepared .
The putative positive clones were plaque purified , digested with Sstl ( for the placental library ) or XhoI ( for the leukocyte library ) , and subcloned into the pBluescript II SK- vector ( Stratagene ) for sequencing ( Sambrook et al .
, 1989 ) .
The nucleotide sequence was determined from denatured double-stranded templates by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase ( United States Biochemical Corp. ) ( Sanger et al .
, 1977 ; Kraft , et al .
, 1988 ) .
Alternatively , the sequence was obtained directly from the phage DNA using a dsDNA cycle sequencing system ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
The sequences were stored and analyzed using GCG software ( University of Wisconsin ) .
Cells-K562 cells ( American Type Culture Collection no .
CCL 243 ) were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 2 mm L-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO ; and 95 % air .
Induction of interferon-a ( Intron A , Schering Corp. ) and interferon-y ( a generous gift from Genentech Inc. ) was performed at 1,000 units/ml .
5279 5280 Primer Extension Analysis-A 40-nucleotide primer ( @ °GGTATAAGT-GTTGCTAGGGTGTGTGAAATGGAAATGAAAG®* ) to the IRF-2 mRNA was 5'-end-labeled with [ y-°°PJATP ( > 6,000 Ci/mmol , New England Nuclear ) by using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. ) .
The primer was hybridized to 60 ug of total RNA and subjected to primer extension with 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus RNase H- reverse transcriptase ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
Extension products were separated on a 6 % polyacrylamide sequencing gel in parallel with a *°S-labeled sequencing reaction ( Sequenase ) by using the same primer on a IRF-2 genomic DNA fragment containing the 5'-flanking sequence and the first exon subcloned into pBluescript .
RNase Protection Assay-A 421-nucleotide probe from the 5'-end of IRF-2 cDNA was labeled with [ « -*°P ] JUTP by using T7 RNA polymerase from the RNA transcription kit ( Stratagene ) .
The probe was hybridized to 5-10 ng of total RNAs in a hybridization buffer provided in a ribo-nuclease protection assay kit ( Ambion ) at 37-42 °C for 16 h. The hybridized products were digested with a RNase A/RNase Tl mixture at room temperature for 30-45 min .
The protected products were separated on a 6 % polyacrylamide sequencing gel in parallel with *°P-la-beled MspI digests of pBR322 as markers .
Other probes used in the RNase protection assay were IRF-1 , 356 nucleotides from the 5'-end of IRF-1 cDNA and actin , 100 nucleotides from the 5'-end of actin cDNA .
Plasmid DNA-Deleted clones in pXP2 ( Nordeen , 1988 ) were prepared from the PCR products .
These products were phosphorylated at 5'-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Pharmacia ) , filled in the 3 ' recess DNA ends with nucleotides by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , and ligated to pXP2 at the Smal site .
Expres-gion constructs for IRF-1 and ISGF3y were prepared by ligating 2,000 bp of IRF-1 cDNA insert from pUC18 to pcDNA I ( Invitrogen ) at the EcoRI site or 1,500 bp of ISGF3y cDNA from pBluescript SK- ( a generous gift from David Levy ) to pcDNA I at the Xhol/Xbal sites , respectively .
Transient Expression Analysis with Luciferase Genes-DNAs were transfected into K562 cells as described by Sims et al .
( 1993 ) with the following modifications .
For electroporation , pulses were applied in three trains with 15 pulses/train .
Interferons were added to the cell culture 1 h after the transfections .
Cells were harvested 18-24 h after induction and assayed for luciferase activity ( in arbitrary light units ) .
Each transfection was performed in duplicate and corrected for transfection efficiency by cotransfecting with pSVB ( a B-galactosidase reporter gene driven by the SV40 early promoter ) .
The promoterless vector pXP2 was used as a negative control .
Others-Conditions for the PCR were described ( Cha et al .
, 1992 ; Sims et al .
, 1993 ) .
All oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Cruachem PS-250 DNA synthesizer .
RESULTS Isolation of Human IRF-2 Genomic Clones-To study the genomic organization of IRF-2 , two human genomic libraries were screened with P-labeled full-length IRF-2 cDNA and then with cDNA fragments harboring different parts of the cDNA sequence .
Three positive clones from the placental library ( containing the 5'-flanking region , exons 1-5 , 8 , and 9 , and the 3'-flanking region ) and one clone from the leukocyte library ( containing exons 6 and 7 ) were identified from 2 x 10° plaque-forming units and were subcloned into the pBluescript vector for sequencing .
Sequencing was performed on the exons and the exon-intron boundaries , and then on the 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences .
The complete nucleotide sequences of the exons and partial sequences of introns of human IRF-2 are shown in Fig .
1 .
The sequence began with the major transcription initiation site and ended at a site 210 nucleotides 3 ' to the end of the published cDNA sequence for IRF-2 .
All intron-exon boundaries conformed to known splice junction consensus sequences ( Senapa-thy et al .
, 1990 ) , except for the one associated with the seventh intron , which began with an AG dinucleotide .
The IRF-2 gene consisted of nine exons that ranged in size from 47 nucleotides ( exons 5 and 8 ) to 1,337 nucleotides ( exon 9 ) .
The first exon contained only a 5'-untranslated sequence ; the initiating ATG codon was located in the second exon , where it was preceded by a six-nucleotide 5'-untranslated sequence , as indicated in Fig .
1 .
The open reading frame of IRF-2 continued Human Interferon Regulatory Factor 2 Gene in exons 3-8 , and a termination codon ( TAA ) was encountered in exon 9 .
The sequence of the exons confirmed most of the cDNA sequences published by Itoh et al .
( 1989 ) .
A single nucleotide change from C to T was detected in exon 3 .
This change resulted in an amino acid change from arginine to tryptophan at position 58 .
This nucleotide change was confirmed by sequencing a cDNA clone .
?
In addition , a single nucleotide substitution from G to A , a dinucleotide TT addition , and a dinucleotide substitution from TC to AA were detected in exon 9 ( Fig .
1 ) ; however , no amino acid changes were involved .
Chromosomal Localization of the Human IRF-2 Gene-DNA isolated from 24 human-rodent somatic cell hybrids retaining one or two human chromosomes ( mapping panel no .
2 from Coriell Cell Repositories ) was used to determine the chromosomal location of the IRF-2 gene .
Two sets of primers were selected in a PCR assay .
One set of primers formed a single product ( 365 bp of the IRF-2 DNA ) only in human DNA but not in rodent DNA .
The second set of primers forming an 82-bp product in DNA from all species was used as a positive control to ensure equal amount of DNA in each sample ( Fig .
2 ) .
The IRF-2 DNA was found in all hybrids containing human chromosome 4 .
Transcription Initiation Site and 5'-Flanking Region-The 5'-flanking sequence of IRF-2 was 1.5 kilobases in length just before the first exon ( Fig .
34 ) .
As summarized in Fig .
3B , the promoter lacked a TATA box but did contain a putative CAAT box at position -278 to -274 , Three GC boxes ( GGGCGG ) , which are potential Sp1l-binding sites , were located beyond the 3'-end of the CAAT box and one Spl-binding site beyond the 5'-end .
Interspersed with the GC boxes were AARKGA hexamers ( where R = A or G and K = G or T ) and GAAANN sequences , which are commonly found in type I interferon gene and ISG promoters .
A putative NF- « B motif 3 `` to the CAAT box conformed to the consensus GGGRNNYYCC ( where R = A or G , Y =C or T , and N = any nucleotide ; Baeuerle , 1991 ) .
Primer extension analysis of the IRF-2 gene was performed to determine the transcription start site ( Fig .
4 ) .
A primer was synthesized from +50 to +11 ( 5 ' to 3 ' ) of the published sequence for the human IRF-2 cDNA ( Itoh et al .
, 1989 ) .
The primer was used for both the primer extension assays and a sequencing reaction .
The analysis revealed one major and several minor initiation sites ( Fig .
4 ) .
All minor initiation sites were further upstream from the major site .
Transcription at the major initiation site would generate a transcript that would include 10 nucleotides in addition to the IRF-2 cDNA or 108 nucleotides 5 `` to the initiation methionine codon .
Functional Analysis of the IRF-2 Promoter-In order to study the function of IRF-2 promoter , the fragment containing the 5'-flanking region of IRF-2 ( clone -1555 ) was subcloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter gene vector pXP2 ( Fig .
3C ) .
The recombinant construct was transfected into K562 cells and tested for inducibility with both interferon-y and interferon-a ( Fig .
5 ) .
The promoter ( clone -1555 ) was found to be active in the absence of any inducers ( Fig .
5 , A and C ) in the transient transfection assay and in the RNase protection assay ( see Fig .
7 ) , which was expected since four potential Spl-binding sites were present in the region ( Fig .
3B ) .
The activity of IRF-2 promoter in unstimulated cells was studied further by using various deleted clones of the IRF-2 promoter ( Fig .
3C ) .
When one of four Spl sites was deleted ( clone -195 ) , it appeared to be more active than the intact promoter ( Fig .
54 ) .
However , if all four Spl sites were removed ( clones -85 , -60 , and -20 ) , the recombinant clones showed little activity in the absence of any inducers .
On the other hand , the response of IRF promoter to interferon-y was different when compared 2 Y , Cha and A. Deisseroth , unpublished data .

A 2-fold induction by interferon-y ( Fig .
5B ) was observed with the clones containing Spl sites ( clones -1555 and -195 ) .
The higher levels of induction which appeared in the clones -85 and -60 were caused by the decrease of the basal activity due to the absence of Sp1 sites in these clones .
Clone -20 did not respond to the interferon-y treatment .
The promoter was also inducible with interferon- « ( Fig .
5C ) .
The extent of induction by interferon-y was greater than that of interferon-a .
The data suggest that the interferon-y interacts with the sequence ( s ) present in clone -60 but absent in clone -20 .
Induction by IRF-1-To determine the possible effects of other interferon-inducible proteins on the IRF-2 promoter , the IRF-2 promoter construct and deleted clones of the 5'-flanking region of IRF-2 ( Fig .
3C ) were cotransfected with an expression vector containing IRF-1 cDNA ( Fig .
6A ) or ISGF37y cDNA .
The basal level of expression in each clone was lower in Fig .
64 than in Fig .
5A since less proteins were used to perform the luciferase activity assay .
IRF-1 was found to strongly enhance the activity of the IRF-2 promoter ( Fig .
6A ) .
About 10-fold induction by IRF-1 was observed in the whole-length promoter ( clone ~1555 ) and deleted promoter constructs ( clones -195 and -85 ) ( Fig .
6B ) .
The extent of induction was increased when 1495 bp from 5'-end of the fragment was deleted ( clone -60 ) .
The induction of IRF-1 to the IRF-2 promoter seems to be unrelated to the presence of the Sp1 sites since the highest induction was 5282 Human Interferon Regulatory Factor 2 Gene el A Chr H cmF 2 s 4 5 6 7 8 910 111213 141516171819 $ 2122X YH C M go - MEW Fic .

Induction of endogenous IRF-2 mRNA by overexpressed IRF-1 .
Total RNA was prepared from K562 cells transfected with parental vectors ( pXP2 and peDNA I , lane 2 ) or with IRF-1 in the expression vector peDNA I ( Zane 3 ) .
The tRNA was used as the source of RNA to serve as a negative control for the RNase protection assay ( lane 1 ) .
The probes used in the RNase protection assay were IRF-1 , IRF-2 , and actin cDNAs .
the expression of the IRF-1 mRNA and the endogenous IRF-2 mRNA , respectively .
An actin cDNA probe was used as a control for the amount of the total RNA used in each sample .
IRF-2 was detected in unstimulated cells transfected with the parental expression vector ( Fig .
7 , lane 2 ) .
No expression of IRF-1 was observed in these cells .
When cells were transfected with IRF-1 cDNA in the expression vector , a high level of IRF-1 mRNA expression was observed ( Fig .
7 , lane 3 ) .
The overexpressed IRF-1 is active as shown in Fig .
6C , by which it activates the expression of interferon-B promoter .
The expression of IRF-2 mRNA ( Fig .
7 , lane 3 ) also increased when comparing with the basal level ( lane 2 ) .
These results are consistent with those of the transient transfection assay .
These data suggest that IRF-1 induces the expression of IRF-2 at the transcription level .

Aligned amino acid sequences of human IRF-2 and IRF-1 .
The homologies were determined with the University of Wisconsin GCG program BESTFIT .
The splice sites , where the exonic sequences were interrupted by introns , are marked by an asterisk at the top of the IRF-2 sequence and underneath the IRF-1 sequence .
Single-letter amino acid codes are shown .
Sequences were numbered on the right of each line .
An underlined amino acid indicates that the coding triplet for that amino acid was interrupted between the first and second nucleotides by an intron .
Identical amino acids between two sequences were labeled as `` !
`` , conservative substituted amino acids were labeled as `` . ``
and `` : . ``
boundary .
We also provided direct evidence for the interaction between IRF-1 and IRF-2 using a transient expression assay and RNase protection assay .
This information is necessary to begin a detailed analysis of the regulatory mechanisms of IRF-2 gene expression .
The IRF-2 gene consists of nine exons and eight introns , whereas human IRF-1 contains 10 exons and nine introns ( Cha et al .
, 1992 ) .
The exon organization of the human IRF-2 and IRF-1 genes is very similar ( Fig .
8 ) .
In particular , it is noteworthy that the exon phase is identical in the corresponding introns of human IRF-2 and IRF-1 .
In both genes , the coding triplet is interrupted between the first and second nucleotides in introns 3 , 4 , 6 , and 7 ( Figs .
1 and 8 ) .
Introns 2 , 5 , and 8 , on the other hand , have no interruption in the coding triplet .
The size of each exon is almost identical for both the IRF-2 and IRF-1 genes , except the ninth exon of IRF-2 is longer and covers both the ninth and tenth exons of IRF-1 ( Fig .
8 ) .
These results strongly indicate that IRF-1 and IRF-2 were derived from a common primordial gene .
The 5'-flanking regions of human IRF-2 and IRF-1 are very similar .
Both regions contain a putative CAAT box and lack a TATA box .
Multiple transcription initiation sites were found in IRF-2 ( Fig .
4 ) and in IRF-1 by primer extension analysis , as described by Sims et al .
( 1993 ) .
Numerous AARKGA hexamers and GAAANN sequences were found throughout the 5'-flanking sequences of IRF-1 ( Sims et al .
, 1993 ) and IRF-2 ( Fig .
3 ) .
Both promoters seem to be constitutively expressed and are inducible with interferon- « and interferon-y , as shown by the 5286 Inducers IFN _ Virus Prolactin IL-6 m : + iRF-2 Phorbol ester| - 1* \\ / ISG _ IFN Fic .

Model of interaction and function of IRF-1 and IRF-2 .
Induction and repression were marked as `` + `` and `` - `` , respectively .
The abbreviations used were : IL-6 , interleukin-6 ; TNF , tumor necrosis factor ; LIF , leukemia inhibitory factor ; IFN , interferons ; ISG , interferon-stimulated genes .
transient expression assays .
The response to interferon-y in both promoters is stronger than the response to the inter-feron-a « a treatment ( Fig .
5C for IRF-2 ; Sims et al .
, 1993 , for IRF-1 ) .
However , despite all the similarities , there are some differences between the 5'-flanking regions of IRF-2 and IRF-1 .
First , the locations of the CAAT box are different between IRF-2 ( -278 to -274 ) and IRF-1 ( -97 to -91 ) .
Second , eight putative Sp1 sites and three NF- « B motifs were found in IRF-1 , whereas only four Spl sites and one NF- « B motif were found in IRF-2 .
The extent of induction by interferons was much greater in the IRF-1 promoter than in the IRF-2 promoter , as shown in the transient transfection assays .
These differences could explain the ways these genes are regulated in the cells and their different responses to interferons .
A truncated form of IRF-2 ( PRDI-BFi ) was reported by both Whiteside et al .
( 1992 ) and Palombella and Maniatis ( 1992 ) .
Although the cDNA for PRDI-BFi was not cloned , Palombella and Maniatis ( 1992 ) deleted 185 amino acids from the C-ter-minal of IRF-2 and tested the truncated gene to show that it behaved as did PRDI-BFi in terms of molecular mass and mobility on gel shift assay .
If the site of truncation for PRDI-BFi that they proposed is correct , it would be located inside exon 6 .
Therefore , it is unlikely that the production of PRDI-BFi is a result of an alternative splicing .
As Palombella and Maniatis ( 1992 ) suggested , PRDI-BFi is probably a product of proteolysis in post-translational modification of IRF -2 .
It was reported by other investigators that IRF-1 is activated first when cells are exposed to virus or interferons and that IRF-2 expression is increased 4-6 h later ( Miyamoto et al .
, 1988 ; Fujita et al .
, 1989 ; Harada et al .
, 1989 , 1990 ; Pine et al .
, 1990 ; Watanabe et al .
, 1991 ) .
Direct evidence for an inductive effect of IRF-1 on the IRF-2 promoter has not been shown before .
On the basis of the results presented in Figs .
5A and 6A , the putative binding site ( s ) of IRF-1 to the IRF-2 promoter and responsive domain of the IRF-2 promoter to interferon treatments appear to be located in 40 nucleotides ( -60 to -20 bp ) 5 to the major transcriptional initiation site of IRF-2 .
A potential binding site found in interferon and interferon-inducible gene promoters ( the GAAANN site ) is found in this region ( Fig .
3 ) .
It is possible that the GAAANN sequence could be associated with the IRF-1-binding site in the transcriptional activation of IRF-2 .
However , no obvious binding pattern was observed on the gel shift assay . ``
It was reported by Sims et al .
( 1993 ) that the IRF-1 promoter is not induced by IRF-1 protein .
As proposed on a model shown in Fig .
9 , IRF-1 is activated by inducers and activated IRF-1 induces the expression of interferons and interferon-inducible genes .
To break the loop of IRF-1 and interferon interaction , IRF-1 activates the expression of IRF-2 .
Increased expression of IRF-2 competes with IRF-1 for the binding on the interferon promoter and terminates the expression of interferons .
The induction of activated IRF-1 on the IRF-2 promoter did not require the presence of interferons since the genes for both Human Interferon Regulatory Factor 2 Gene interferon-a and interferon-B were deleted in K562 cells ( Diaz et al .
, 1988 ) .
The core sequence of PRDI in the interferon-§ promoter ( GAAANN ) is found in the interferon-stimulated response element ( ISRE ) of interferon-inducible genes ( Naf et al .
, 1991 ) .
It was reported that IRF-1 ( ISGF-2 ) could bind to the ISRE ( Pine et al .
, 1990 ; Naf et al .
, 1991 ) .
Besides IRF-1 , two other proteins binding to ISRE of the interferon-inducible genes , interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 ( ISGF3 ) and interferon consensus se-quence-binding protein ( ICSBP ) , have been characterized recently ( Levy et al .
, 1989 ; Driggers et al .
, 1990 ; Fu , 1992 ; Fu et al .
, 1992 ; Schindler et al .
, 19922 , 1992b ; Kanno et al .
, 1993 ; Nelson et al .
, 1993 ) .
ISGF3 is a transcriptional activator that mediates the transcriptional induction of a set of genes immediately after interferon- « treatment ( Fu , 1992 ; Fu et al .
, 1992 ; Schindler et al .
, 1992b ) .
ISGF3 is a multicomponent complex in which three subunits ( ISGF3 « ) associate with a DNA-binding domain ( ISGF3y ) ( Levy et al .
, 1989 ; Schindler et al .
, 1992a ) .
Unlike IRF-1 , ISGF3qy seems to have little effect on the expression of IRF-1 and IRF-2 . ``
These data suggest that different activation pathways are required for the IRF family and ISGF3 .
ICSBP is another member of IRF family which exhibits a similar inhibitory function with respect to IRF-2 and sequence homologies with IRF-2 ( Driggers et al .
, 1990 ; Kanno et al .
, 1993 ; Nelson et al .
, 1993 ) .
It is not known whether IRF-1 can induce the expression of ICSBP as is the case for IRF-2 .
The complete function of IRF-2 in cells is not clearly under-stood .
On the basis of the data presented by Harada et al .
( 1989 ) and Palombella and Maniatis ( 1992 ) , IRF-2 may inhibit the IRF-1-dependent activation of the interferon-B promoter .
The ratio of IRF-1/IRF-2 plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation ( Palombella and Maniatis , 1992 ; Harada et al .
, 1993 ) .
Harada et al .
( 1993 ) showed that overexpression of IRF-2 resulted in a transformed phenotype in NIH 3T3 cells and tumorigenicity in nude mice .
It would be interesting to know whether IRF-2 performs these functions directly through its regulation on the interferon genes or by regulation of IRF-1 and other interferon-inducible genes .
We are currently studying the interaction of IRF-2 with other interferon-inducible proteins and trying to understand the complete regulation and functions of IRF-2 .
