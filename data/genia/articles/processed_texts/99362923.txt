Sasaki , * J. Marie Hardwick , * and Dan L. Longo* From the * Laboratory of Immunology , N ational Institute on A ging N ational Institutes of Health , Baltimore , Maryland 21224-6825 ; and the *Department of Molecular Biology and Immundlogy , Johns Hopkins School of Public Health , Baltimore , Maryland 21205 Summary Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli , including chemotherapy drugs and glu-cocorticoids .
It is generally accepted that Bel-2 exerts its antiapoptotic effects mainly by dimer-izing with proapoptotic members of the Bcel-2 family such as Bax and Bad .
However , the mechanism of the antiapoptotic effects is unclear .
Paclitaxel and other drugs that disturb microtubule dynamics kill cells in a Fay Fas ligand ( FasL ) -dependent manner ; antibody to FasL inhibits paclitaxel- induced apoptosis .
We have found that Bel-2 overexpression leads to the prevention of chemotherapy ( paclitaxel ) -induced expression of FasL and blocks paclitaxel-induced apoptosis .
The mechanism of this effect is that Bel-2 prevents the nuclear translocation of NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes , a transcription factor activated by microtubule damage ) by binding and sequestering calcineurin , a calcium-dependent phosphatase that must dephosphory-late NFAT to move to the nucleus .
Without NFAT nuclear translocation , the FasL gene is not transcribed .
Thus , it appears that paclitaxel and other drugs that disturb microtubule function kill cells at least in part through the induction of FasL .
Furthermore , Bel-2 antagonizes drug-induced apoptosis by inhibiting calcineurin activation , blocking NFAT nuclear translocation , and pre venting FasL expression .
The effects of Bel-2 can be overcome , at least partially , through phos phorylation of Bcel-2 .
Phosphorylated Bel-2 can not bind calcineurin , and NFAT activation , FasL expression , and apoptosis can occur after Bel-2 phosphorylation .
Key words : - Fas ligand « apoptosis « NFAT * Bel-2 « paclitaxel inding of Fas ligand ( FasL ) or an anti- Fas antibody to Fas ( APO -1 or CD-95 ) causes apoptosis in Fas-bearing cells .
Fas is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types ( 1-3 ) , but the expression of FasL is much more restricted ( 4-7 ) .
Although the expression of FasL was originally considered to be restricted to activated T cells and NK cells , FasL has been identified in other cell types , including Sertoli cells and cells of the eye , liver , and kidney ( 8 ) .
The expression of functional FasL by some tissues contributes to their immune-privileged status by preventing the infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes ( 9 , 10 ) .
Recently , constitutive FasL expression has been detected on some tumor cells , indicating that it may function to induce apoptosis in Fas-expressing immune cells when they attempt to enter the tumor ( 11-14 ) .
Moreover , it has been postulated that the Fay FasL system has an important role in the pathogenesis of many diseases such as hepatitis , insulin-dependent diabetes , cancer , and thyroiditis ( Hashimoto 's disease ) ( 15-21 ) . '

The antiapoptotic gene Bel-2 protects cancer cells from apoptosis induced by a variety of anticancer agents ( 22-25 ) .
The precise mechanism by which Bcel-2 inhibits drug-induced apoptosis is unknown .
Mice in which wild-type Bcel-2 was overexpressed documented extended cell survival rather than increased proliferation and led to an accumulation of lymphocytes that eventually progressed to B and T cell malignancy after subsequent genetic changes ( 26-28 ) .
Loss of function studies that knocked out the Bcel-2 or Bel-X ; , death suppressors demonstrated the loss of cells from selected lineages ( 29-31 ) .
Although hematopoietic lineages appear to develop normally in the Bel-mice , they are unable to maintain homeostasis of lymphocytes because of excess apoptotic loss of B and T cells .
Micro-tubule-stabilizing agents such as paclitaxel and docetaxel and microtubule-disrupting drugs such as vincristine , vinblas tine , and colchicine have antimitotic and inducing activity ( 24 , 25 , 32 , 33 ) .
Recently , screening of a library of phage-displayed peptides identified human Bel-2 as a pacli-taxel-binding protein ( 34 ) .
Paclitaxel induces Bel-2 phos phorylation and apoptosis in human leukemic , breast , and 253 The Journal of Experimental Medicine « Volume 190 , Number 2 , July 19 , 1999 253-265 http : // www.jem.org prostate cancer cells ( 24 , 25 , 35 ) , suggesting that phosphorylation of Bel-2 may inhibit Bel-2 function .
The regulation of Bcel-2 function by phosphorylation has been demonstrated at the level of formation of Bel-2-Bax hetero-dimers .
However , it is also possible that Bel-2 exerts its biological effects in additional protein interactions distinct from those with proapoptotic family members .
A growing body of evidence suggests that the nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes ( NFAT ) is expressed in a variety of tissues in addition to lymphocytes ( 36 ) .
To date , NFAT expression or function has been described in several types of nonlymphoid cells including mast cells ( 37 ) , endothelial cells ( 38 ) , vascular smooth muscle cells ( 39 ) , and neuronal cells ( 40 ) .
The messenger RN As of distinct NFAT isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner ( 41 ) .
Linette et al .
( 41a ) have documented a regulatory interaction between Bcel-2 expression and NFAT activation .
Thus , it is possible that NFAT regulates the transcription of genes involved in apoptosis and that antiapoptotic Bel-2 family members act in part by interfering with NFAT -induced gene transcription .
One candidate proapoptotic gene that is regulated by NFAT is FasL .
Transcription of the FasL gene is regulated at least in part by an interaction of NFAT proteins with the FasL promoter ( 42-44 ) .
Transcription mediated by NFAT is regulated tightly in response to second messengers such as calcium .
Increased intracellular C # + stimulates calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of cytoplasmic NFAT , leading to its nuclear translocation ( 45 ) .
T cell activation was found to induce NFAT binding to the FasL enhancer ( 45 ) .
Thus , it is possible that Bel-2 mediates its antiapoptotic effects not only by forming heterodimers with proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members but also through antagonism of NFAT activation .
In this study , we examine the intracellular mechanisms by which Bel-2 inhibits apoptosis induced by microtubule-damaging drugs ( paclitaxel , vincristine , and vinblastine ) in Jurkat T lymphocytes and breast carcinoma cells .
We demonstrate that expression of FasL plays a significant role in apoptosis induced by microtubule-damaging drugs .
Upon exposure to such drugs , FasL is rapidly expressed .
Antibody to FasL inhibits paclitaxel-induced apoptosis .
In cells overexpressing Bel-2 , FasL expression is blocked upon exposure to low doses of paclitaxel .
The mechanism by which Bel-2 inhibits FasL expression is indirect ; Bel-2 binds to calcineurin and inhibits its dephosphorylation and release of NFAT .
Thus , NFAT is unable to translocate to the nucleus and FasL transcription does not occur .
These results suggest a mechanism by which Bel-2 acts to block drug- or activation-induced apoptosis .
Very high doses of paclitaxel can overcome the inhibitory effects of Bel-2 on NFAT nuclear translocation .
High doses of paclitaxel lead to Bel-2 phos phorylation and dissociation from calcineurin , which allows NFAT activation and FasL expression .

Results FasL Is Involved in Poditaxel-induced A poptosis : - FasL induction has been demonstrated in activation-induced cell death in T cells ( 47-51 ) and in the death of other cell types induced by anticancer drugs ( 52 ) , gamma irradiation ( 53 ) , and UV light ( 54 ) .
We investigated the possibility of the involvement of the FasL/ Fas pathway in paclitaxel- induced apoptosis .
Jurkat cells or MDA-MB-231 cells were stably transfected with either pSSFV-Neo or pSSFV-Bcl-2 expression vector to assess the protective effects of Bel-2 on paclitaxel-induced apoptosis ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
Treatment of cells with paclitaxel resulted in induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner , and overexpression of Bel- 2 inhibited paclitaxel- induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
1 C ) .
The paclitaxel dose-response curve suggests a 10-fold increase in resistance in cells overexpressing Bcl-2 .
Neutralization of FasL by treatment of cells with anti-FasL antibody ( NOK-2 ) significantly inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in both JT/ Neo and JT/ Bcel-2 cells .
Indeed , very little tumor cell death could be documented in Bcel-2-over-expressing Jurkat cells exposed to anti-FasL antibody .
To examine the role of Bel-2 in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis , we used MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells , which do not express endogenous Bcel-2 ( Fig .
1 B ) .
Overexpression of Bcl-2 in MDA cells inhibited paclitaxel- induced apoptosis by greater than two logs ( Fig .

by anti-FasL antibody ( NOK-2 ) significantly inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in MDA/ Neo but had little effect in MDA/ Bcl-2 cells .
Incubation of cells with Fas-blocking antibody inhibited paclitaxel- induced apoptosis in JT/Neo and JT/Bcel-2 cells .
Similarly , overexpression of mutant CD95/Fas ( mutant receptors lacking intracellular cytoplasmic domains ) inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis ( Fig .
1 F ) .
Taken together , these data demonstrate that ( a ) paclitaxel-induced apoptosis can be inhibited by Bcel-2 and ( b ) the FasL/ Fas pathway , at least in part , mediates paclitaxel-induced apoptosis .
Bd-2 Blocks FasL Expression .
The induction of FasL during activation- or drug-induced cell death has been reported ( 47-52 ) .
As neutralization of FasL by anti-FasL antibody inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis , we sought to evaluate the expression of FasL in wild-type and Bcl-2-overexpressing cells .
Treatment of wild-type MDA cells with paclitaxel , vincristine , or vinblastine induced FasL expres sion in a time-dependent manner ( Fig .
2 A ) .
Treatment of breast cancer cells ( MDA and MCF-7 ) with paclitaxel resulted in induction of FasL in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
2 B ) .
We have previously demonstrated that Bel- 2 inhibits apoptosis induced by microtubule-damaging drugs ( paclitaxel , vincristine , and vinblastine ) ( 25 ) ; therefore , it was of interest to examine whether Bel-2 would also inhibit FasL expression .
Treatment of MDA/ Neo cells with 50 nM of paclitaxel or vincristine resulted in induction of FasL ; by contrast , the induction of FasL was blocked by overexpression of Bel-2 in MDA/Bcl-2 cells ( Fig .
2 C ) .
JT/Neo cells expressed some FasL at baseline , and paclitaxel induced an increase in FasL expression .
The expres sion of Bel-2 in JT/ Bel-2 transfectants blocked both the baseline expression and the induction of FasL by paclitaxel MDA ( Fig .
2 D ) .
Thus , Bel-2 expression interferes with FasL expression .
Bd-2 Blocks NFAT Translocation to the Nudeus .
- The activation of calcineurin , a serine phosphatase , is regulated by calcium .
Activated calcineurin functions to dephosphory-late NFAT family members ( 45 ) .
Dephosphorylated NFAT proteins then translocate to and enter the nucleus , where they serve an essential role in regulating the expression of many cytokine genes ( 55 , 56 ) .
As Bel-2 blocks paclitaxel-induced FasL expression and apoptosis , we examined the effects of Bel-2 on NFAT translocation to the nucleus .
NFAT was localized to the cytoplasm in untreated ( control ) JT/ Neo and JT/ Bel-2 ( Fig .
3 A ) .
When JT/ Neo cells were treated with paclitaxel , NFAT translocated to the nucleus ( Fig .
3 A ) .
In contrast , overexpression of Bcl-2 blocked paclitaxel-induced NFAT translocation to the nucleus ( Fig .
3 A ) .
Similarly , overexpression of Bel-2 blocked paclitaxel-induced NFAT translocation to the nucleus in MDA/ Bcl-2 cells ( Fig .
3 B ) .
We confirmed paclitaxel-induced NFAT translocation by confocal microscopy ( Fig .
4 ) .
We next examined if Bcl-2 would block NFAT translocation to the nucleus in MDA cells by immunocytochemistry .
As seen in Fig .
4 B , NFAT was localized to the cytoplasm in MDA/Neo and MDA/ Bcl-2 cells ( Fig .
4 , green ) .
Treatment of MDA/Neo cells with paclitaxel resulted in NFAT translocation to the nucleus ( Fig .
4 , red plus green = yellow color ) and apoptosis ( frag-mented nucleus stained with red color ) .
As expected , overexpression of Bel-2 blocked paclitaxel-induced NFAT translocation to the nucleus and apoptosis in MDA cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
Bd-2 Binds to Caldneurin but not NFAT .
- The Bcl-2 inhibition of NFAT translocation to the nucleus is not direct but rather involves calcineurin ( 57 ) .

These results indicated that NFAT did not bind to Bel-2 in either JT/Neo or JT/Bcel-2 cells When the NFAT immunoprecipitate was followed by NFAT Western blot , similar amounts of NFAT were immunoprecipitated ( Fig .
5 A ) .
Therefore , the apparent lack of association of NFAT and Bel-2 is not related to inefficient NFAT immunoprecipitation .
We next examined the interaction between Bel-2 and calcineurin in paclitaxel- or vincristine-treated JT/Neo and JT/Bcl-2 cells .
Cells were exposed to paclitaxel or vincristine for 48 h and then lysed .
Lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to either Bel-2 ( Fig .
5 B ) or calcineurin ( Fig .
5 C ) , and Western blots were performed with the antibody not used in the immunoprecipitation .
As shown in Fig .
5 B and C , Bel-2 was able to bind calcineurin in untreated JT/ Neo and JT / Bel-2 cells .
When JT/ Neo and JT / Bel-2 cells were treated with paclitaxel ( 50 nM ) or vincristine ( 50 nM ) , less calcineurin was bound to Bcel-2 ( Fig .
5 , B and C ) .
These results suggest that Bcel-2 binds to calcineurin but not to NFAT , and the fraction of Bcel-2 and calcineurin bound to each other decreases upon exposure to the drugs .
These results suggest that the phosphorylation of Bcel-2 stimulated by the drugs may also influence Bcl-2 binding to calcineurin just as it affects Bel-2-Bax interaction ( 25 ) .
The immunosuppressants cyclosporin and FK506 inhibit NFAT -dependent transcriptional events by binding calcineurin and blocking its enzymatic activity , thus preventing the redistribution of NFAT to the nucleus ( 36 ) .
To evaluate the involvement of active calcineurin in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis , cells were treated with the FK506 analogue ascomycin ( Fig .
5 D ) .

258 - Inhibition of Fas Ligand Transcription by Bcl-2 was acting to prevent calcineurin activation , its effects should have been mimicked by the pharmacological calcineurin inhibition of ascomycin .
Overexpression of Bel-2 inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in these cell lines .
As expected , treatment of cells with ascomycin inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in neo- and Bel-2-transfected cells ( Fig .
5 D ) .
Ascomycin appears to inhibit apoptosis ad-ditively in Bcel-2-expressing cells .
It is possible that ascomycin has additional effects unrelated to Bcl-2 binding of calcineurin .
These data confirm that inhibition of calcineurin activation blocks paclitaxel-induced apoptosis .
Because a rise in intracellular free calcium levels [ ( C # +* ) i ] is essential for calcineurin activation ( 56 ) , we sought to examine the effects of chelating intracellular free calcium by BAPTA-AM on paclitaxel-induced apoptosis ( Fig .
5 E ) .
JT/Neo and JT/Bcel-2 cells were pretreated with 10 uM BAPT A-AM for 45 min and then treated with paclitaxel ( 50 nM ) for 48 h. Overexpression of Bel-2 significantly inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis .
Interestingly , chelation of intracellular free calcium by BAPT A-AM inhibited paclitaxel induced apoptosis in JT/ Neo and JT / Bel-2 cells ( Fig .
5 E ) .
That paclitaxel induces a rise in [ ( C # +* ) i ] has been described by others ( 58 ) and confirmed by us ( data not shown ) .
These data suggest that a rise in is required for paclitaxel-induced apoptosis .
These results provide additional evidence that paclitaxel-induced apoptosis involves a rise in [ ( C # +* ) i ] , leading to calcineurin activation , which in turn leads to NFAT translocation and expression of FasL .
BH4 Domain of Bd-2 Is Required for Interaction with Cal-aneurin and Paditaxel-induced FasL Expression and Apoptosis .
Thus , Bcel-2 blocked NFAT translocation by binding to calcineurin but not directly to NFAT .
The BH4 domain of Bcl-2 has been demonstrated to mediate heterodimerization with calcineurin .
We wished to use this finding to verify that the antiapoptotic effects of Bel-2 were related to calcineurin binding .
To answer this question , MDA cells were trans fected with empty vector ( MDA/Neo ) , wild-type Bcl-2 ( MDA/Bcel-2 ) , or ABH4 Bcel-2 ( Bcel-2 lacking ABH4 do-main , MDA/ABH4 Bcel-2 ) ( Fig .

Fig .
6 B demonstrates that paclitaxel induced FasL expression in MDA/Neo cells Overexpression of wild-type Bcl-2 ( MDA/Bcel-2 ) , but not ABH4 Bcl-2 , inhibited paclitaxel-induced FasL expression ( Fig .

We next examined the ability of ABH4 Bcl-2 to bind with calcineurin in MDA cells MDA/ neo , MDA/ Bel-2 , and MDA/ ABH4 Bel-2 cells were treated with paclitaxel , and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anticalcineurin antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Bcl-2 antibody .
Fig .
6 C demonstrates that wild-type Bcl-2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with calcineurin , and treatment of cells with low doses of paclitaxel significantly inhibited the Bcl-2-calcineurin interaction .
As expected , ABH4 Bcl-2 was unable to heterodimerize with calcineurin .
As treatment of cells with high doses of paclitaxel causes more complete Bel-2 phosphorylation , we sought to examine if phosphorylated Bcl-2 can bind to calcineurin .
We and others have previously shown that the loop region of Bcl-2 is an important target for regulatory phosphorylation ( 59 , 60 ) .
MDA/ Neo , MDA/ Aloop Bel-2 ( which can not be phosphorylated ) , and MDA/Bcel-2 cells were treated with 200 nM paclitaxel for 48 h ( Fig .
6 D ) .
Treatment of MDA/ Bcel-2 cells with high doses of paclitaxel causes phos phorylation of wild-type Bcel-2 , whereas paclitaxel has no effect on Aloop Bel-2 ( phosphorylation-deficient mutant ) ( Fig .
6 D , top panel ) .
In addition , phosphorylated Bel-2 was unable to bind with calcineurin ( Fig .
6 D , bottom panel ) .
By comparison , Aloop Bel-2 was not phosphorylated by paclitaxel and formed heterodimers with calcineurin .
These data suggest that phosphorylation of Bel-2 is essential for calcineurin to be released from the complex .
Because ABH4 Bcl-2 was not able to bind with calcineurin , we sought to examine the effects of this mutant on paclitaxel-induced apoptosis Overexpression of wild-type Bcel-2 in MDA cells significantly inhibited paclitaxel A 14000 L_ ] Control B RRB Paclitaxel ( 0.1 uM ) 12000-10000 8000-1 6000 4000- Relative Light Units 2000 0 .

Bd-2 Blocks Paditaxel-induced FasL Promoter A divity .
It has been shown that the FasL promoter contains two NFAT binding sites ( 42 , 43 ) .
We next addressed the functional importance of the two NFAT sites for paclitaxel- mediated FasL expression by generating mutations at one or both NFAT binding sites .
Two FasL sites were also mutated in the context of the full length , 486-bp FasL reporter so that FasL expression in this system would not kill the cells .
Jurkat cells were transfected with the wild-type reporter or double mutant reporter constructs and then left untreated or treated with paclitaxel .
As shown in Fig .
7 A , treatment of JT/ Neo cells transfected with wild-type FasL reporter resulted in a 10-fold increase in luciferase activity relative to control cells .
In contrast , the reporter containing mutations in both NFAT sites exhibited no luciferase production over control in JT/ Neo cells ( Fig .
7 A ) .
Interestingly , overexpression of the Bel-2 gene in JT cells ( JT/ Bcl-2 ) inhibited wild-type FasL promoter activity in cells treated with paclitaxel .
As expected , low levels of luciferase activity were detected in cells transfected with the double NFAT mutant reporter plasmid in JT / Bel-2 cells ( Fig .

We next sought to examine the FasL promoter activation in MDA-MB-231 cells that do not express endogenous Bcl-2 protein .

Collectively , these results indicate that Bcl-2 blocked FasL transcription by inhibiting NFAT activity .
Discussion Involvement of FasL in Apoptosis .
- Activation of T cells results in expression of FasL and induction of apoptosis .
In comparison to activation-induced FasL expression in T cells , FasL is constitutively expressed in other selected cell types .
The identification of FasL expression on cells in immune privileged sites , such as testis ( 9 ) and the anterior chamber of the eye ( 10 ) , has suggested that FasL may be important in tolerance induction and immunosuppression .
Indeed , inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the eye undergo Fas mediated apoptosis and show a systemic tolerance to herpes simplex virus ( HSV-1 ) infection ( 10 ) .
In addition to immune cells , expression of FasL on human tumors , including colon ( 61 ) , hepatocellular carcinoma ( 62 , 63 ) , melanoma ( 12 ) , and lung carcinoma ( 13 ) has been demonstrated ; this expression on cancer cells may be involved in induction of apoptosis in Fas-expressing T cells .
Here we have shown that paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in lymphoid and breast tumor cells is mediated at least in part by increased expression of FasL .
As Fas is constitutively expressed in most tumors cells , induction of FasL would be an amplification signal for tumor cell apoptosis .
FasL-neutralizing antibody nearly completely abrogates apoptosis induced by microtubule poisons such as paclitaxel and vinblastine .
Recent studies have suggested that environmental stress mediated by exposure to gamma irradiation ( 53 ) , UV light ( 54 ) , and anticancer drugs such as etoposide or doxorubicin ( 52 ) induces upregulation of Fas receptors and ligands , resulting in autocrine or paracrine cell death .
However , the level of Fas expression is only one of the factors regulating the susceptibility to Fas mediated apoptosis ( 64 ) .
Exposure to radiation , anticancer drugs , or other forms of stress may lead to apoptosis , not only by increasing surface expression of Fas , but also by affecting intracellular signaling molecules activated upon Fas ligation .
Indeed , numerous drug-resis tant cell lines were also found to be resistant to Fas- mediated apoptosis ( 65 ) .
These findings support the hypothesis that apoptosis mediated by both chemotherapeutic agents and physiologic stimuli such as Fas ligation may share common downstream effector molecules .
Bd-2 Inhibits N FAT Translocation to the N udeus by Binding to Calaneunin but not NFAT .
- The expression of FasL is inhibited by immunosuppressive agents CsA and FK506 ( 47 , 50 , 66 , 67 ) , suggesting that the transcription factor NFAT is involved in FasL induction .
Our data demonstrate that the FK506 analogue ascomycin inhibits paclitaxel-induced FasL expression and blocks apoptosis .
These data suggest that the calcineurin-NFAT pathway is involved in the control of FasL expression and consequent paclitaxel- induced apoptosis .
261 Srivastava et al .
Current evidence indicates that both nuclear import and export of NFAT can be regulated dynamically ( 68 , 69 ) .
In T cells , relatively profound and sustained cytosolic C # + transients , such as those that occur after antigen receptor engagement , appear to be necessary to activate calcineurin and counterbalance the effects of processes that effect nuclear export of NFAT ( 70 ) .
It has recently been suggested that the Ca # * signals of shorter duration elicited by activation of the Ga , receptors may preferentially activate the putative negative regulatory processes ( 71 ) , whereas activation of calcineurin , dephosphorylation of NFAT , and its subsequent nuclear import require Ca* transients of longer duration .
Recent studies have provided evidence that a nuclear kinase activity is involved in rephosphorylating NFAT and exporting it to the cytosol as a means for terminating its transcriptional activity ( 72 ) .
Although protein kinase A and glycogen synthase kinase 3 have been implicated as the major NFAT kinases in Jurkat T cells , calmodulin-depen-dent kinases appear to have some NFAT nuclear export activity as well as a heterotopic expression system ( 70 ) .
We have shown that NFAT regulates the induction of FasL upon paclitaxel treatment in Jurkat T cells and breast cancer cells .
It has been demonstrated that the FasL promoter contains two NFAT binding sites ( bp -263 to -283 relative to the FasL translation ) .
Furthermore , the ability of a mutation in this NFAT site ( within the context of a 486-bp FasL reporter ) to prevent reporter activity in lymphocytes illustrates that this response element is critical for the regulated expression of FasL in our studies .
In addition to the observation that CsA inhibits expression of FasL ( 47 , 50 , 67 ) in lymphocytes and that NFAT -deficient mice do not inducibly express FasL ( 73 ) , these results strongly suggest that NFAT transcription factors are critical for the regulation of FasL expression in lymphocytes and breast carcinoma .
The induction of FasL reporter expression is blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2 .
The comparison of the NFAT binding region of the FasL promoter with IL-2 and TNF-a promoters provides some insight into the regulation of these genes .
AP-1 ( acti-vator protein 1 ) binding sequences are adjacent to NFAT sites in the IL-2 promoter ( 74 ) , whereas the NFAT sites from the FasL promoter do not include any surrounding predicted AP-1 binding sequences .
In contrast , the sequence of the FasL promoter NFAT binding site is similar to that of a previously reported NFAT site within the TNF-a promoter ( 75 ) .
Because of the structural and functional similarities between TNF-a and FasL , it is intriguing to speculate that the conserved NFAT regulatory sequences within the promoters of these genes may have arisen from a common ancestral apoptosis-inducing gene .
As FasL plays an important role in control of lymphocyte apoptosis , and , according to our data , drug-induced apoptosis , we have examined the intracellular mechanism of FasL induction in human T cells and breast cancer cells The mechanism by which Bel-2 inhibits drug-induced FasL expression and apoptosis is not known .
We have demonstrated that Bcel-2 inhibits paclitaxel-induced NFAT translocation to the nucleus through interactions with calcineurin .
In deed , Bel-2 does not bind to NFAT directly , as has also been reported by others ( 57 ) .
The BH4 domain of Bel-2 binds to calcineurin and thereby inhibits the translocation of NFAT .
Calcium-dependent phosphorylation of calcineurin is essential for activation of NFAT and subsequent translocation to the nucleus .
The inhibition of paclitaxel-induced NFAT translocation and apoptosis by Bcl-2 may be one of the mechanisms by which Bel-2 regulates apoptosis .
We have previously shown that microtubule-damaging drugs ( paclitaxel , vincristine , and vinblastine ) induced Bel-2 phosphorylation and apoptosis .
Indeed , phosphorylated Bel-2 loses its antiapoptotic function and is unable to heterodimerize with the proapoptotic partner Bax .
This free Bax itself can induce apoptosis .
Therefore , phosphorylation of Bcel-2 may result in at least two events : ( a ) release of Bax and ( b ) failure to hold on to or sequester calcineurin .
Model : Inhibition of Paditaxel-induced Apoptosis by Bd-2 .
Collectively , these data support a model in which microtubule-damaging drugs such as paclitaxel stimulate an increase in intracellular free C # + that activates calcineurin , which results in NFAT nuclear translocation , FasL expression , and apoptosis ( Fig .
8 A ) .
Apoptosis can be blocked either by treatment of cells with anti-FasL antibody ( Fig .
1 ) or by overexpression of Bel-2 .
Bel-2 sequesters calcineurin , which results in blockage of NFAT nuclear translocation , FasL expression , and apoptosis ( Fig .
8 B ) .
All of the phosphorylation sites of Bel-2 are located within the loop region ( amino acid 32-80 ) .
The loop region deletion mutant Bcl-2 ( Aloop Bel-2 ) can not be phosphorylated and does not release calcineurin from the complex after paclitaxel exposure , and it becomes hyperfunctional in inhibiting drug-induced apoptosis The inhibition of FasL translocation by Bel-2 can be overcome by treatment of cells with high doses of paclitaxel ( > 100 nM ) ( Fig .
8 C ) .
Treatment of cells with high doses of paclitaxel results in inactivation of Bcel-2 through phosphorylation .
Phosphorylated Bel-2 can not bind calcineurin , and NFAT activation and FasL expression can occur after Bel-2 phosphorylation .
