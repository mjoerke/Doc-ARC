10 Cloning and Characterization of the B Subunit of Human Proximal Sequence Element-Binding Transcription Factor and Its Involvement in Transcription of Small Nuclear RNA Genes by RNA Polymerases II and III LIN BAI , ZHENGXIN WANG , JONG-BOK YOON , f anp ROBERT G. ROEDER* Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , The Rockefeller University , New York , New York 10021 Received 13 May 1996/Returned for modification 23 June 1996/Accepted 15 July 1996 The proximal sequence element ( PSE ) -binding transcription factor ( PTF ) , which binds the PSE of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed mammalian small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) genes , is essential for their transcription .
We previously reported the purification of human PTF , a complex of four subunits , and the molecular cloning and characterization of PTF y and 8 subunits .
Here we describe the isolation and expression of a cDNA encoding PTFRB , as well as functional studies using anti-PTF $ B antibodies .
Native PTFB , in either protein fractions or a PTF-Oct-1-DNA complex , can be recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant PTFB .
Immunodepletion studies show that PTFRB is required for transcription of both classes of snRNA genes in vitro .
In addition , immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate that substantial and similar molar amounts of TATA-binding protein ( TBP ) and TFIIB90 can weakly associate with PTF at low salt conditions , but this association is dramatically reduced at high salt concentrations .
Along with our previous demonstration of both physical interactions between PTFy/PTFS and TBP and the involvement of TFIIIB90 in the transcription of class III snRNA genes , these results are consistent with the notion that a TBP-containing complex related to TFIIIB is required for the transcription of class III snRNA genes , and acts through weak interaction with the four-subunit PTF .
Mammalian small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) genes are transcribed either by RNA polymerase II ( pol II ) ( class II , such as U1 to US genes ) or by RNA pol III ( class III , such as U6 and 7SK genes ) ( for reviews , see references 6 , 7 , 11 , 14 , and 18 ) .
Both classes of snRNA genes contain a distal sequence element ( DSE ) around position -220 , which bears at least an octamer motif and functions as an enhancer , as well as an essential proximal sequence element ( PSE ) around position -60 .
The PSE may also function in transcription start site selection and/or transcript 3'-end formation ( 8 , 16 , 17 ) .
Inter-estingly , in addition to the PSE and the DSE , class III genes contain a TATA box around position -25 , which functions as the major determinant of RNA pol III specificity ( 12 , 13 ) .
The PSEs of the two classes of genes are functionally interchangeable ( 12 , 13 , 17 ) .
This finding indicates that the PSE per se is not the determinant of RNA polymerase specificity , although the transcription factor ( s ) bound to the PSE may differentially interact with both pol II and pol III transcription factors to assist in RNA polymerase selection .
We previously showed that the human PSE-binding transcription factor ( PTF ) binds specifically to the PSE of both classes of snRNA genes and that this binding is greatly stimulated by Oct-1 binding to the adjacent octamer site ( 15 ) .
Human PTF was purified to near homogeneity and shown to be a stable complex containing 180- , 55- , 45- , and 43-kDa subunits , designated PTFa , -B , -y , and -8 , respectively ( 26 ) .
UV cross-linking experiments indicated that PTFe « is the * Corresponding author .

5419 DNA-binding subunit ( 26 ) .
We have also reported the cloning and characterization of PTFy and PTF8 and the use of corresponding antibodies to verify that PTF is required for transcription of both classes of snRNA genes in a PSE-dependent manner ( 27 ) .
PTFy and PTF8 were also found to interact physically with TATA-binding protein ( TBP ) in vitro ( 27 ) .
Several laboratories have independently reported other PSE-binding activities , including PSE-binding protein 1 ( 3 , 10 ) , PSE-binding protein ( 23 , 25 ) , and snRNA-activating protein complex ( SNAPc ) ( 5 , 20 ) .
Because of similar DNA-binding activities , transcriptional activities , and apparent subunit compositions for PTF and SNAPc , including identities of PTFy and PTF8 with SNAP43 and SNAP45 , respectively ( 5 , 19 , 27 ) , it is clear that PTF and SNAPc are closely related .
The major difference is that SNAPc was described as a TBP -containing complex analogous to TFIIIB , TFIID , and SL1 ( 5 , 20 ) , whereas TBP was not detected either in highly purified PTF or in complete PTF complexes immunoprecipitated by anti-PTFA antibodies at 400 mM KCl ( 27 ) .
The results are consistent with the ability of either free TBP or SNAPc , but not PTF , to restore U1 transcription to TBP-depleted extracts ( 20 , 27 ) .
However , since TBP was evidently substoichiometric in the SNAPc preparations ( 5 ) , as well as in low-salt anti-PTF8 immunoprecipitates from nuclear extracts ( 27 ) , the description of SNAPc as an analog of other stable TBP-TBP -associated factor ( TAF ) complexes may be inappropriate .
Moreover , other studies have also implicated the 90-kDa subunit of TFIIIB , which interacts strongly with TBP , in transcription of class III snRNA genes , most likely in a complex distinct from the conventional TFIIIB complex ( 22 , 24 ) .
Hence , the nature of interactions between PTF , TBP , and TFIIIB90 , mediated in part by known TBP interactions both with TFIIIB90 and with PTFy/SNAP43 and PTF8/SNAP45 , and the relationship of these interactions to SNAPc remain important questions .
Here 5420 BAI ET AL .
we report the molecular cloning and characterization of PTFRB and further document the composition of native PTF and the nature of interacting proteins .
MATERIALS AND METHODS HeLa cell extracts and factors .
HeLa cells were maintained in Joklik minimal essential medium with 5 % bovine calf serum .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously ( 2 ) .
The partially purified PTF used in transcription , elec-trophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) , and immunoprecipitation analyses was the Q-Sepharose fraction described previously ( 27 ) .
Plasmids .
O*P* and O*P~ 7SK maxigene templates were described previously ( 15 ) .
The pU1*G~ and pU2*G~ plasmids ( generously provided by N. Hernandez ) were described by Sadowski et al .
( 20 ) .
The 5GpMLG~ plasmid ( generously provided by D. K. Lee ) contains five Gal4 binding sites and the adenovirus major late promoter fused to a G-less cassette .
Cloning of cDNA encoding PTFB .
Human PTF was purified as described previously ( 26 ) and separated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -8 % polyacrylamide gel .
Resolved polypeptides were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Millipore ) .
The band corresponding to PTFB was excised and digested with the endoproteinase Lys-C. After separation of derived peptides by high-performance liquid chromatography , amino acid sequences for three peptides for PTFB subunit were determined at the Rockefeller University sequencing facility .
On the basis of peptide sequences shown in Fig .
1 , two degenerate oligonucleotide probes were designed for initial screening of a human B-cell cDNA library ( 1 ) .
The probes used were GARGATGGIGARGATCCIGARG TIATICCIGAIAACAC and CTIGGIGARTTYCTIGCITACCCITATGTIGA YCCIGGIACITTCAAC .
DNA fragments corresponding to the 5 ' regions of the cDNA inserts of the positive clones were generated by PCR .
The DNA fragments were then used as probes for subsequent screening of human B-cell and HeLa cDNA libraries .
Final positive clones were excised in vivo in the presence of helper phages and transferred into pBluescript SK ( Stratagene ) or pEXlox ( Novagen ) vectors as instructed by manufacturers .
The nucleotide sequences of the clones were determined by double-stranded DNA sequencing using Seque-nase 2.0 ( U.S. Biochemical ) .
Antigen and antibody preparation .
cDNAs encoding PTFB were subcloned into pRSET ( Invitrogen ) vectors to produce His-tagged recombinant PTFB .
The recombinant partial and full-length PTFBs contain , respectively , 32 and 35 additional N-terminal amino acids that are encoded by the vectors .
The constructs were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS ( 21 ) .
After isopropyl-B-p-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) induction , recombinant proteins were purified by nitrilotriacetic acid-resin ( Qiagen ) affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions and subsequently by electroclution following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) .
To prepare antiserum , New Zealand White rabbits were injected intradermally with 500 ug of antigen emulsified with an equal volume of Freund 's complete adjuvant .
Subsequently the rabbits were boosted subcutancously every 4 weeks with 250 g of antigen emulsified with an equal volume of Freund 's incomplete adjuvant .
Blood was collected from dorsal ear veins 10 days after each boost .
The antigens were cross-linked to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B ( Pharmacia ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
They were then used to purify corresponding antisera as described previously ( 4 ) .
In vitro translation .
In vitro transcription and translation of PTFB cDNA clones were performed with TNT lysate ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
To increase the translational efficiency , the second nucleotide upstream of the first ATG ( position 10 ) in the PTFB cDNA clone was changed from A to C. EMSA .
The O *P* and O*P~ probes for EMSA were prepared by end labeling the HindIII restriction fragments of O*P* and O*P~ plasmids with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA pol I and [ a- `` P ] dATP .

The binding reaction was initiated by the addition of protein , and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30°C .
One microliter of antiserum or purified antibody was then added to the reaction mixture , which was further incubated for 10 min .
The reaction mixture was loaded directly onto a 4 % ( 37.5:1 , acrylamide/bisacrylamide ) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.5 % TBE ( 0.045 M Tris-borate , 0.001 M EDTA [ pH 8.0 ] ) containing 0.03 % NP-40 and run at 150 V for 2 h at room temperature .
Immunoblot analysis .
Unless stated otherwise , immunoblot analyses with various antibodies were performed with Amersham 's enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
In the experiments shown in Fig .
7 , immunoblot analysis was performed with the Vistra chemiffuorescence system from Amersham and Molecular Dynamics according to the manufacturers ' instructions .
After incubation with the substrate , the membranes were scanned with the Storm Image system from Molecular Dynamics to quantitate the chemiffuorescent signal .

Immunodepletion of HeLa nuclear extracts with anti-PTFB antibodies .
A 300-pl aliquot of protein A-Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia ) was incubated with 300 g of antigen-purified antibodies against partial-length PTFRB antibodies for 2 h at 4°C with constant mixing .
After washes with buffer BC ( 20 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.9 ] , 20 % [ vol/vol ] glycerol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 mM DTT ) containing 0.03 % NP-40 and 100 mM KCI ( BC100 ) and then BC400 , the beads were incubated with 1 ml of BC400 containing 0.25 mg of BSA per ml at 4°C for 3 h. The beads were then washed with BC400 and incubated for 9 h at 4°C with 300 pl of HeLa nuclear extract adjusted to 400 mM KCI-5 mM DTT .
After centrifugation , the supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 150 pl of protein A-Sepharose beads , which had been preincubated with BC400 with 0.25 mg of BSA per ml , to remove any residual immunoglobulins .
The supernatant was dialyzed against BC100 , and aliquots were frozen .
In vitro transcription .
Transcription reactions for adenovirus VA1 and human 7SK genes were performed in a reaction mixture with 2.5 pl of Hela nuclear extract and with 25 ng of VA1 and 0.9 ug of 7SK supercoiled DNA templates .
The reaction mixture also contained 10 mM HEPES-KOH ( pH 7.9 ) , 5 mM MgCl , , 5 mM creatine phosphate , 70 mM KCI , 1 mM DTT , 500 wM each ATP , CTP , and UTP , 25 uM GTP , 2.5 wCi of [ « - `` °P ] GTP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ) , and 2 pg of e-amanitin per ml .

The mixture was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol .
The precipitates were resuspended in 90 % formamide-10 mM EDTA-0.1 % bromophenol blue-0.1 % xy-lene cyanol and analyzed on an 8 % polyacrylamide denaturing gel .
Transcription reaction mixtures for pU1*G~ , pU2*G~ , and 5GpMLG~_ templates ( 25 pl ) contained 9 pl of HeLa nuclear extract , 50 ng of 5GpMLG~ , and 1.5 ug of cither pU1*G~ or pU2*G~ supercoiled DNA template .

After 2 h of incubation at 30°C , the mixture was extracted and analyzed on a 5 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described above .
Immunoprecipitation from HeLa nuclear extracts with anti-PTFf antibodies .
One milligram of antigen-purified anti-PTFB antibodies was first bound to 0.5 ml of protein A-Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia ) and then covalently cross-linked to the beads with dimethyl pimelimidate as described previously ( 4 ) .
As a control , preimmune immunoglobulin G was purified from preimmune serum with protein A-Sepharose beads as described previously ( 4 ) .
In the experiments shown in Fig .
6 , 50 l of antibody-coupled beads was incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 1 ml of HeLa nuclear extract in buffer BC ( 20 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 7.9 ] , 20 % [ vol/vol ] glycerol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride , 1 mM DTT ) containing 100 mM KCI-0.05 % NP-40 , 200 mM KCI-0.05 % NP-40 , 300 mM KC1-0.05 % NP-40 , or 300 mM KCI-O0.1 % NP-40 .
After the beads were washed extensively with the same buffer , the bound proteins were eluted twice with 50 pl of 0.1 M glycine ( pH 2.5 ) .
The eluted proteins were pooled and neutralized with 10 pl of 1.5 M Tris-HCl ( pH 8.8 ) , and aliquots were analyzed by immunoblotting .
For the experiments shown in Fig .
7 , the immunoprecipitation reaction was scaled up to use 10 ml of HeLa nuclear extract .
The eluate was precipitated with 10 % trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 250 pl of 1 % SDS loading buffer .
RESULTS Cloning of cDNA encoding PTFB .
PTF was purified from HeLa $ 100 extracts ( 5 liters , 100 g of protein ) as described previously ( 26 ) , and individual polypeptides were transferred to a membrane after separation by SDS-PAGE .
The polypeptide corresponding to PTFB was subjected to peptide micro-sequencing .
Three peptide sequences were obtained , and two of them were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a human cDNA library ( Fig .

The predicted amino acid sequence contains all three PTFB peptide sequences obtained via microse-quencing .
The deduced open reading frame of PTFB is generally acidic , with an isoelectric point of 4.95 .
There are potential leucine zipper and/or zinc finger motifs in the carboxyl-terminal region .
Database searches revealed that PTFRB is a novel protein .
It has a weak sequence relationship with a deduced Vou .

Sequence of PTFB .
( A ) cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of PTFB .
Peptide sequences obtained from microsequencing of the purified protein are underlined .
Peptides a and b are the peptide sequences used to design probes for screening a human cDNA library to obtain the initial partial clone .
The regions between amino acids 312 and 334 and between amino acids 354 and 383 represent potential zinc finger motifs , while the region between amino acids 321 and 356 represents a potential leucine zipper motif .
( B ) Sequence comparison between human PTFB and a C. elegans hypothetical protein ( GenBank accession number 235603 ) .
Amino acids 153 to 409 of PTFB are aligned with amino acids 151 to 402 of the C. elegans hypothetical protein ( Hypo ) .
Lines represent sequence identity .
Caenorhabditis elegans protein ( Fig .
1B ) .
The hypothetical C. elegans protein contains 418 amino acids , with a calculated molecular mass of 48.9 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.99 .
Approximately 250 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal regions of the two sequences have a similarity of 53.0 % and an identity of 28.1 % .
The significance of this relationship is not known .
Antibodies raised against recombinant PTFRB recognize native PTFB .
In immunoblot assays , affinity-purified antibodies raised against recombinant PTFR expressed in bacteria reacted strongly with a 55-kDa peptide in both a HeLa nuclear extract ( Fig .
2 , lane 3 ) and a partially purified PTF fraction ( see Fig .
6A , lane 1 , and Fig .
7A , lane 1 ) .
Since the apparent size of PTFB in purified native PTF ( 55 kDa ) is larger than the calculated molecular mass of the cloned PTFRB ( 46.75 kDa ) , the PTFB cDNA was transcribed and translated in rabbit reticu-locyte lysates .
In an immunoblot analysis ( Fig .
2 ) , recombinant in vitro-translated PTFB showed the same mobility in SDS-PAGE as native PTFB , indicating that the cDNA clone encodes the full-length PTFB .

Recombinant PTFB and the native PTFB have the same mobilities in SDS-PAGE .
In vitro translation of the PTFRB clone was performed as described in Materials and Methods .
One microliter of control in vitro translation reaction mixture ( lane 1 ) , 1 l of in vitro translation reaction mixture for the PTFB cDNA clone ( lane 2 ) , and 1 pl of HeLa nuclear extract ( NE ) mixed with 1 pl control in vitro translation reaction mixture ( lane 3 ) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10 % polyacrylamide gel .
The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , and immunoblotting was performed with antigen-purified anti-PTFB antibodies .

As shown in Fig .

Preimmune ( PT ) and immune ( I ) sera ( 1 pJ ) against Oct-1 ( lanes 9 and 10 ) and purified preimmune ( PT ) and immune ( T ) antibodies ( 1 pl ) against PTFB ( lanes 11 and 12 ) were incubated with the reaction mixture after sufficient time for complex formation .

PTFB is required for activation of the human 7SK gene .
In vitro transcription of adenovirus VA1 and human 7SK genes was performed with untreated HeLa nuclear extract ( lane 1 ) , mock-depleted HeLa nuclear extract ( lane 2 ) , PTFB-depleted HeLa nuclear extract ( lane 3 ) , or PTFB-depleted HeLa nuclear extract supplemented with 1 pl of partially purified PTF ( lane 4 ) .
Each reaction mixture contained 0.9 ug of 7SK and 25 ng of VA1 supercoiled DNA templates .
The positions of 7SK and VA1 transcripts are indicated .
PSE dependent .
Immune serum against Oct-1 ( lane 10 ) , but not preimmune serum ( Jane 9 ) , eliminated both Oct-1-DNA and Oct-1-PTF-DNA complexes and resulted , instead , in the formation of an antibody-dependent supershift complex at the top of the gel , confirming that both complexes contained Oct-1 .
Anti-PTFB antibodies ( lane 12 ) , but not preimmune antibodies ( lane 11 ) , abolished preformed Oct-1-PTF-DNA complexes but did not affect preformed Oct-1-DNA complexes .
These results indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes a polypeptide which corresponds to the native B subunit of P PTFRB is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes .
Immunodepletion assays were used to test the requirement of PTFB for transcription of the two classes of snRNA genes .
HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads coated with purified anti-PTFB antibodies in order to deplete endogenous PTFB .
As shown in Fig .
4 , immunodepletion of PTFR specifically diminished transcription of the 7SK gene but did not affect transcription of the VA1 gene , which is also transcribed by pol III ( lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The addition of partially purified PTF to the PTF-depleted extract restored transcription of the 7SK gene but had no obvious effect on transcription of the VA1 gene ( lane 4 ) .
In the case of pol II transcription , depletion of PTFB from nuclear extracts specifically diminished transcription of both the U1 ( Fig .
5A , lanes 2 and 3 ) and U2 ( Fig .
5B , lanes 2 and 3 ) genes but did not affect transcription of the adenovirus major late promoter .
Addition of partially purified PTF to the PTF-depleted extracts restored transcription of the U1 ( Fig .
5A , lane 4 ) and U2 ( Fig .
5B , lane 4 ) genes , again with no obvious effect on transcription of the major late promoter .
These results indicate that PTFRB is specifically required for transcription of both classes of snRNA genes .
Equimolar amounts of TBP and TFIIIB90 can loosely associate with PTF .
As discussed earlier , studies of the interactions and relationships between PTF , TBP , and TFIIIB90 are critical both for understanding the function of these components in U6/7SK transcription and for resolving the reported differences between PTF and SNAPc .
Toward this objective , we immunoprecipitated nuclear extracts with antigen-purified anti-PTFB antibodies under four conditions .
The bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by immunoblot assays after SDS-PAGE .
Specificity was evident from coimmunoprecipitation by immune but not preimmune antibodies .
The amounts of immunoprecipitated PTFB and PTF8 were essentially unchanged at all conditions ( Fig .
6A ) , confirming previous indications ( 26 , 27 ) that PTF is a highly stable multisubunit complex .
In the cases of TFIIIB90 and TBP ( Fig .
6B ) , high levels of each were immunoprecipitated at 100 mM KCI-0.05 % NP-40 ( lanes 2 Vou .

In vitro transcription reactions were performed with untreated HeLa nuclear extract ( lane 1 ) , mock-depleted nuclear extract ( lane 2 ) , PTFB-depleted HeLa nuclear extract ( lane 3 ) , or PTFB-depleted HeLa nuclear extract supplemented with 1 pl of partially purified PTF ( lane 4 ) .

and 3 ) .
These levels were greatly reduced , by similar propor-tions , at 200 mM KCI-O0.05 % NP-40 ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
When the KC ] concentration was increased to 300 mM , almost no TBP or TFIIIB90 could be detected in the immunoprecipitates ( lanes 6 to 9 ) .
These results indicate that TFIIIB90 and TBP associate with PTF only through weak interactions that are easily disrupted at higher salt concentrations .
We next quantitated the levels of communoprecipitated PTFB , PTF8 , TBP , and TFIIIB90 at 100 mM KCI-0.05 % NP-40 by immunoblot analysis .
Figure 7A shows an immunoblot analysis for quantitation of PTFB and PTF8 .
Three different amounts of immunoprecipitated sample were analyzed ( lanes 2 to 4 ) , along with variable amounts of a mixture containing equimolar concentrations of His-tagged PTFB and His-tagged PTF3 as standards ( lanes 5 to 13 ) .
As a control , partially purified native PTF was also included ( lane 1 ) .
Similarly , Fig .
7C shows an immunoblot analysis for quantitation of TBP and TFIIIB90 .
The immunoprecipitated sample ( lane 2 ) was analyzed along with variable amounts of a mixture containing equimolar concentrations of His-tagged TBP ( 9 ) and Flag-tagged TFIIIB90 ( 24 ) ( lanes 3 to 11 ) .
As a control , a highly purified glycerol gradient fraction of TFIIIB ( 24 ) was included in lane 1 .
Results from the recombinant PTFR-PTF8 ( Fig .
7B ) g SUBUNIT OF HUMAN PTF 5423 and recombinant TBP-TFIIIB90 ( Fig .
7D ) protein analyses were used to plot standard curves of the amounts of the respective proteins versus the intensities of the Western blot ( immunoblot ) signals ; the latter were quantitated by the Storm Image system and are plotted as relative fluorescent units ( rfu ) .
On the basis of these standard curves , the amounts of corresponding native proteins in the samples were determined .
The standard PTF fraction ( Fig .
7A , lane 1 ) contained 5.4 nM PTFRB and 5.7 nM PTF8 , while the standard TFIIIB fraction ( Fig .
7B , lane 1 ) contained 2.8 nM TFIHIIB90 and 2.7 nM TBP .
For each complex , the calculated molar ratio of the two components analyzed was roughly 1:1 , as expected , indicating the validity of the approach .
The anti-PTFB antibody-immu-noprecipitated sample , analyzed in Fig .
7 , contained 10 nM PTFB , 5.0 nM PTF8 ( Fig .
7A , lanes 3 and 4 ; lane 2 was not considered because its PTF8 signal fell outside the range of the standard curve ) , 3.9 nM TBP , and 3.4 nM TFIIIB90 ( Fig .
7C , lane 2 ) .
Thus , the PTFB/PTF8/TBP/TFIIIB90 molar ratio in the immunoprecipitated sample was roughly 1:0.5:0.39:0.34 .
The higher molar amount of PTFRB than of other polypeptides most likely reflects dissociation of some of the PTF complexes by the polyclonal anti-PTFB antibodies used in the immuno-precipitation .
This idea is consistent with the EMSA data in Fig .
3 demonstrating dissociation of the PTF-Oct-1-DNA complex by anti-PTFB antibodies .
These data indicate that substantial and similar molar amounts of TBP and TFIIIB90 can associate with PTF under low-salt conditions .
DISCUSSION The PSE is an essential element for transcription of mammalian snRNA genes .
PTF specifically recognizes the PSE , interacts with upstream activators ( such as Oct-1 ) to activate basal transcription , and assists in type-specific RNA polymerase selection by interacting with both pol II and pol III transcription factors .
To study PTF function and mechanisms of snRNA gene transcription , we have undertaken the molecular cloning and characterization of PTF subunits .
The cloning and characterization of the 8 and y subunits of PTF ( 27 ) , equivalent to SNAP45 and SNAP43 , respectively ( 5 , 19 ) , were reported previously .

Quantitation of PTFB , PTF8 , TBP , and TFIIMB90 coimmunoprecipitated by anti-PTFB antibodies at 100 mM KCI-0.05 % NP-40 .
Immunoprecipitation from HeLa nuclear extract by anti-PTFB antibodies was performed as described in Materials and Methods .
Immunoprecipitated samples , native protein fractions , and recombinant protein standards were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the Vistra chemifluorescence system and the Storm Imaging system .
( A ) Immunoblot analysis to quantitate PTFB and PTF3 .
The samples analyzed were 7 pl of partially purified PTF ( lane 1 ) ; 1 , 3 , and 6 pl ( lanes 2 to 4 ) of immunoprecipitation sample ( IP ) ; and 0.5 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 14 , and 17 pil ( lane 5 to 13 ) of a mixture containing 5 nM recombinant full-length His-tagged PTFB ( hPTFB ) and 5 nM His-tagged PTF3 ( LPTF8 ) .
Immunoblotting was performed with a mixture of anti-PTFB antibodies and anti-PTF8 antibodies .
( B ) Standard curves for the amounts of recombinant PTFRB and PTF8 versus Western blot signal intensities quantitated by the Storm Imaging system .
The 7-1 PTF sample and the 1- , 3- , and 6-pl immunoprecipitation samples from panel A gave PTFB and PTF8 signals , respectively , of 2.7 and 2.4 ; 0.97 and 0.35 ; 2.4 and 0.65 ; and 4.5 and 1.6 ( 10° rfu ) .
( C ) Immunoblot analysis to quantitate TBP and TFIIIB90 .
The samples analyzed were 8 pl of highly purified native TFIIIB fraction ( lane 1 ) ; 5 l of immunoprecipitation sample ( lane 2 ) ; and 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , and 17 pl ( lanes 3 to 11 ) of a mixture containing 2.5 nM His-tagged TBP ( hTBP ) and 2.5 nM Flag-tagged TFIIIB90 ( fTFIIIB90 ) .
Immunoblotting was performed with a mixture of anti- TBP antibodies and anti-TFIIIB90 antibodies .
( D ) Standard curves for the amounts of recombinant TBP and TFIIIBY0 versus Western blot signal intensities quantitated by the Storm Imaging system .
The 8-41 TFIIIB sample from panel C gave signals of 3.5 and 1.6 ( 10 ' rfu ) for TFIIIB90 and TBP , respectively , while the 5-ul immunoprecipitation sample gave corresponding signals of 2.9 and 1.5 ( 10 ' rfu ) , respectively .
The concentrations of stock solutions of recombinant PTFB , PTF8 , TBP , and TFIIIB90 were measured by Coomassic blue staining using BSA as standard following SDS-PAGE .
PTF and further document interactions of functionally relevant general factors with PTF .
Cloning of cDNA encoding PTFB .
As described previously ( 26 ) , human PTF was purified to near homogeneity from HeLa cell extracts .
Peptide sequences were obtained and used to clone a cDNA corresponding to the 55-kDa subunit of PTF .
A number of independent cDNA clones were isolated for PTFB , and all were derived from a single mRNA species .
All three peptide sequences obtained from the 55-kDa protein band were found within the predicted amino acid sequence based on PTF cDNA , indicating that the 55-kDa band in purified PTF represents only a single polypeptide .
Database searches revealed that PTFRB is a novel polypeptide with a weak sequence relationship with a hypothetical C. elegans protein of similar peptide length , molecular mass , and isoelectric point .
It is possible that the hypothetical C. elegans protein represents the C. elegans counterpart of human PTFB .
No other significant sequence relationship was found with other known peptide sequences .
Because there are many patches of hydrophobic amino acids in PTFB , and because antibodies against PTFB can disrupt the Oct-1-PTF-DNA complex , it may be speculated that PTFB occupies a central position within the PTF complex .
There are potential zinc finger and leucine zipper motifs in the carboxyl-terminal re-gion , indicating that PTFB may interact with DNA , although our previous UV cross-linking experiments ( 26 ) suggested that PTFa is the primary PSE-binding subunit within the PTF complex .
Antibodies raised against bacterially expressed recombinant PTFB recognize native PTFB in HeLa nuclear extracts , in purified PTF fractions , and in the preformed Oct-1-PTF-DNA complex .
Depletion of PTFB from HeLa nuclear extracts diminished both pol II and pol III transcription of snRNA genes , and the addition of partially purified PTF restored transcription .
These results confirm that PTFRB is required for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes and that cloned PTFRB corresponds to a component of the native PTF as previously defined .
Composition of PTF and its association with TBP and TFIIIB90 .
Our past and present studies indicate that the « , 3 , y , and 8 subunits of PTF copurify through various chromato-graphic steps , are present in the most purified fraction in similar molar amounts , remain together in an Oct-1-PTF-DNA complex , and are coimmunoprecipitated by either anti-PTFB or anti-PTF38 antibodies at high-salt conditions .
Altogether , these studies demonstrate that these four polypeptides are Vou .
16 , 1996 tightly associated , genuine subunits of PTF .
Consistent with the observations that recombinant TBP can interact physically with recombinant PTFy ( SNAP43 ) and PTF8 ( SNAP4S ) in vitro ( 5 , 19 , 27 ) and that SNAPc preparations contain substoichiometric amounts of TBP ( 5 ) , we show here that very substantial ( and potentially stoichiometric ) amounts of TBP and TFIIIB90 may associate with PTF under low-salt ( 100 mM KC ] ) conditions in nuclear extracts .
However , these associations are weak and dramatically reduced at higher salt concentrations .
Furthermore , TBP and TFIIIB90 are coimmunoprecipitated in equimolar amounts under the low-salt condition , and both are proportionally dissociated from PTF at the higher salt concentrations .
Given the previous demonstration of a tight association ( resistant to at least 1 M KCI ) between TFIIIB90 and TBP in natural or core TFIIIB complexes ( 24 ) , these results suggest that most of the TBP associated with PTF is not in a free form but rather is in a TFIIIB90-containing complex .
Therefore , free TBP is apparently not a genuine subunit of PTF or the related SNAPc .
It also seems inappropriate to consider either SNAPc or the low-salt-isolated PTF complex as conventional TBP-TAF complexes because they do not show both the stoichiometric and the highly stable subunit interactions characteristic of well-established TBP-TAF complexes such as SL1 , TFIID , and TFIIIB .
It is more likely that the previously described SNAPc preparations represent mixtures of PTF and substoichiometric amounts of an interacting TFIIIB-like TBP-TAF complex containing TBP , TFIIIB90 , and perhaps other components .
The discrepancy between the highly purified PTF and SNAPc preparations may be attributed to the different procedures for preparation of cell extracts and fractionation of protein samples .
Since PTF is involved in transcription not only of U6 and 7SK genes by RNA pol III but also of U1 to US genes by RNA pol II , our finding of anti-PTFB antibody-precipitated complexes with near stoichiometric amounts of PTF subunits and TFIIIB-related components is somewhat surprising .
However , for the following reasons , the present data are not incompatible with dual PTF functions and the existence of analogous PTF-accessory factor complexes specific for the U1 to US genes .
First , the nuclear extracts from which the PTF-TBP-TFIIIB90 complexes were immunoprecipitated are far more active for U6/7SK transcription than for U1/U2 transcription .
This finding suggests that PTF-interacting factors involved in pol II transcription may not be efficiently retained in or extracted from isolated nuclei or that they may not be stable during extract preparation ( thus allowing preferential interactions of TFIIIB-related components with PTF ) .
Second , while the data presented are reproducible and representative , the quantitative measurements may not be sufficiently accurate ( because of possible systematic errors ) to exclude a subpopu-lation of complexes containing PTF and factors specific for U1 to US genes .
More definitive studies on this point await the identification of such factors and a more quantitative analysis of PTF-containing complexes .
Mechanism of RNA pol III transcription of snRNA genes .
As discussed previously ( 27 ) , an important issue regarding the mechanism of RNA pol III transcription of snRNA genes is whether , as proposed by Sadowski and colleagues ( 20 ) , the presumed SNAPc complex binds to and functions through the PSE while another molecule of TBP binds to and functions at the TATA box ( thereby involving two TBP molecules ) , or whether , as we have suggested ( 27 ) , PTF and a distinct TFIIIB-like complex , consisting of TBP , TFIIIB90 , and possibly other components ( 24 ) , have the potential to interact separately with the two promoter elements .
Our past and current observations strongly support the later model .
The weak associations be g SUBUNIT OF HUMAN PTF 5425 tween PTF and the presumptive TFIIIB-like complex ( tenta-tively designated TFIIIB ' ) , presumably mediated , at least in part , by interactions of TBP with PTFy and PTF8 ( 5 , 19 , 27 ) , could have a synergistic effect on their binding to the PSE and the TATA box and thus facilitate the assembly of the complete preinitiation complex .
At the present time , it remains an interesting possibility that a PTF-TFIIIB ' complex exists in vivo in the absence of DNA binding and that such a complex is a natural or obligate precursor for formation of a functional preinitiation complex on class III snRNA promoters .
More definitive studies on these questions await the further identification and purification of the complete set of factors involved in snRNA gene transcription .
