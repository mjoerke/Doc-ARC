10 Analysis of the Ligand-Binding Domain of Human Retinoic Acid Receptor « by Site-Directed Mutagenesis FRANCOIS P. Y. LAMOUR , PILAR LARDELLI , anp CHRISTIAN M. APFEL* Preclinical Research , F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. , CH-4070 Basel , Switzerland Received 15 May 1996/Returned for modification 24 June 1996/Accepted 9 July 1996 Three subtypes of retinoic acid receptors ( RAR ) , termed RARa « , RAR , and RARy , have been described .
They are composed of different structural domains , including distinct domains for DNA and ligand binding .
RARs specifically bind all-frans-retinoic acid ( RA ) , 9-cis-RA , and retinoid analogs .
In this study , we examined the functional role of cysteine and arginine residues in the ligand-binding domain of hRAR « ( hRAR « -LBD , amino acids 154 to 462 ) .
All conserved cysteine and arginine residues in this domain were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis , and the mutant proteins were characterized by blocking reactions , ligand-binding experiments , transactivation assays , and protease mapping .
Changes of any cysteine residue of the hRARa-LBD had no significant influence on the binding of all-franrs RA or 9-cis RA .
Interestingly , residue C-235 is specifically important in antagonist binding .
With respect to arginine residues , only the two single mutations of R-276 and R-394 to alanine showed a dramatic decrease of agonist and antagonist binding whereas the R272A mutation showed only a slight effect .
For all other arginine mutations , no differences in affinity were detectable .
The two mutations R217A and R294A caused an increased binding efficiency for antagonists but no change in agonist binding .
From these results , we can conclude that electrostatic interactions of retinoids with the RARa « -LBD play a significant role in ligand binding .
In addition , antagonists show distinctly different requirements for efficient binding , which may contribute to their interference in the ligand-inducible trans- activation function of RARa .
Retinoic acid ( RA ) is a biologically active form of vitamin A. All-trans-RA ( t-RA ) has effects on growth and cell differenti-ation , pattern formation , and tumorigenesis ( 7 , 17 , 26-28 , 32 , 34 , 36 , 38 ) .
An effect of RA on nervous system development has also been shown ( 15 , 40 , 41 ) .
The discovery of nuclear retinoic acid receptors ( RARs ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) has greatly advanced the understanding of the mechanism of action of RA .
Three subtypes ( « , B , and y ) constitute the RAR gene family ( 6 , 9 , 19 , 24 , 35 , 37 , 48 ) , and three subtypes ( « , B , and y ) constitute the RXR family ( 22 , 29 , 30 ) .
These receptors belong to the superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors and are in fact ligand-dependent transcrip-tional factors , in which both t-RA and 9-cis-RA are natural ligands for the RARs ( 1 , 13 ) , while 9-cis-RA and phytanic acid are natural ligands for the RXRs ( 16 , 23 , 25 ) .
The receptors are able to bind target sequence RA response elements ( RAREs ) for RARs or retinoid response elements ( RXREs ) for RXRs ( 12 , 31 ) .
On the basis of homology to other nuclear hormone receptors , the primary sequences of RARs and RXRs are divided into distinct domains designated A to F. The C domain constitutes the highly conserved DNA-binding domain , and the E domain confers the ligand-binding properties of each receptor .
The E domains of all subtypes of RARs are highly ( over 90 % ) conserved and contain dimerization , ligand-binding , and transactivation functions .
The C-terminal part of the D domain of human RARa ( hRAR « ) is also required for ligand binding , while the F domain and a part of the N-terminal end of the E domain can be deleted without affecting ligand binding ( 172 , 20 ) .
It has also been shown that the N-terminal portion of the E domain of hRARa « and hRARLB is essential for the recog- * Corresponding author .

5386 nition of retinoids ( 33 ) and that the two hRARa « residues M-406 and I-410 play an important role in 9-cis-RA binding to hRARa ( 47 ) .
Experiments involving limited trypsin digestion of RARa have provided evidence that t-RA binding to the hRARa ligand-binding domain ( LBD ) , as well as 9-cis-RA binding , induces a conformational change which may be required for the interaction of the DNA-bound RARa « -RXRa heterodimer with other transcription factors ( 18 ) .
The RARa selective antagonist Ro 41-5253 ( 2 ) competes with agonists for RARa binding and , when bound to the receptor , induces a different conformational change as detected by limited proteolysis .
Sulfhydryl-blocking reagents have been shown to affect the ligand-binding properties of hRAR « -LBD , suggesting that one or several cysteine residues of the E domain could be relevant for the interaction between t-RA and hRARa « ( 11 ) .
The presence of a free carboxyl group on retinoids has been demonstrated to be essential for ligand binding to RARs ( 3 , 21 ) .
The hypothesis that basic amino acids such as arginine or lysine are involved in ligand-receptor binding has been recently confirmed .
It has been shown that R-269 and K-220 of RARB are important for the binding of RA ( 45 , 46 ) .
Moreover , R-132 of cytoplasmic RA-binding protein II was found to be implicated in the t-RA binding ( 10 ) .
Recently , the structure of the cocrystal hRARy-t-RA has been determined ( 39 ) .
Three arginine residues ( R-274 , R-278 , and R-396 ) and one lysine residue ( K-236 ) were shown to be involved in the ligand-binding pocket of hRARy .
To further clarify the interaction of the LBD of hRARa with t-RA , 9-cis-RA , and other agonists and antagonists , we have prepared site-specific mutants of the hRAR « -LBD .
We have characterized these mutants by using blocking reactions , ligand-binding experiments , transactivation assays , and protease mapping .
We have come to the conclusion that the cysteine residues of the hRARa-LBD play no direct role in the ligand-receptor interaction whereas two single arginine residues , Vou .

Mutations which showed a weak effect are indicated by an open box , and mutations with a strong effect are indicated by a solid box .
R-394 and R-276 , do play a significant role , since mutations into alanine at these residues led to a dramatic decrease in ligand binding .
The same influence of these mutations was observed for t-RA , 9-cis-RA , and synthetic retinoids ( agonists and antagonists ) .
The mutations R217A and R294A increase the ability of hRARa « to bind antagonists , while the mutation C235G specifically decreases antagonist binding .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials .
t-RA , 9-cis-RA , and synthetic retinoids were synthesized at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. , Basel , Switzerland .
t- [ PHJRA ( 53.9 Ci/mmol ; 1 mCi/ ml ) was obtained from DuPont/NEN .
9-cis- [ °HJRA ( 47 Ci/mmol ; 0.2 mCi/ml ) was obtained from Amersham .
The retinoids were solubilized in dimethyl sul-foxide as 10 mM stock solutions and kept at -20°C .
The blocking reagents 2,3-butanedione , N-ethylmaleimide , and 5,5'-dithiobis ( 2-nitrobenzoic acid ) ( DTNB ) were obtained from Fluka .
Sequencing reactions were performed with the Sequenase plasmid-sequencing kit ( U.S. Biochemicals ) , and « -*°S-dATP ( 1 mCi ) was obtained from Amersham .
The in vitro transcription-translation reactions were performed with a TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system ( Promega ) .
Site-directed mutagenesis .
The method used here has been previously described ( 5 ) .
All mutants were produced by two PCRs , the second one consisting of two steps .
The first PCR product was obtained with a 5 ' mutagenic primer and 3 ' primer ( positions 1389 to 1369 ) on plasmid DNA containing hRARe-LBD ( positions 466 to 1389 ) as the template .
The amplified fragment was eluted from an agarose gel .
Together with a 5 ' primer ( positions 466 to 486 ) , this first PCR fragment was used in the second PCR as a 3 ' megaprimer , and a complete hRARa-LBD was obtained after 11 cycles with the now 3'-truncated hRARa ( positions 1 to 1305 ) as template .
To increase the yield of mutagenic hRARa-LBD , the 3 ' primer ( positions 1389 to 1369 ) was added for the last 16 cycles .
The fragment was cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI ( located in the 5 ' primer and the 3 ' primer , respectively ) , purified from an agarose gel , and cloned in T7 Escherichia coli expression vector pET-3a ( 44 ) in which the original EcoRI site was destroyed and a new EcoRI site was inserted directly after the ATG of the Nde !
site .
For all clones , the correctness of the sequence was confirmed by sequencing .
The efficiency of the mutagenesis observed was between 65 and 100 % .
Binding assay and K , , and IC , , determination .
Mutated and wild-type ( wt ) hRARa-LBD were expressed in £ .
coli BL21 ( DE3 ) /pLysS ( 44 ) , after isopropyl-B-p-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) induction .
The protein extractions were performed from 250-ml cultures by lysis of the cells washed in 50 mM Tris ( pH 7.8 ) -30 uM dithiothreitol .
After centrifugation for 10 min at 3,400 X g and 4°C , the bacteria were incubated for 1 h on ice in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 8.0 ] , 10 mM EDTA [ pH 8.0 ] , 75 mM glucose , 2 mM dithiothreitol ) together with 2 mg of lysozyme per ml ; 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were then added ( final concentration ) , and the samples were freeze-thawed twice .
After addition of 0.15 U of aprotinin and 20 pg of leupeptin per ml ( final concentration ) , the samples were sonicated on ice four times for 30 s at level 3 to 4 with a Branson Sonifier 250 .
After centrifugation for 10 min at 24,000 X g and 4°C , the supernatant was recovered .
The protein concentration was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay , and 15 ug of total protein was loaded on a sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -10 % polyacrylamide gel to verify the presence of the expressed hRARa-LBD in the crude protein extracts .
For each protein extract , a series of dilutions were made and used in binding assays to define the appropriate amount of extract to use for the 50 % inhibitory concentration ( ICs , ) and K , , determinations .
The binding assay and the calculation of the ICs , were done as described previously ( 4 ) .
Scatchard analysis was performed by the method of Scatchard ( 43 ) .
Transactivation assay .
For construction of an RARa expression vector for eukaryotic cells and for in vitro translation ( see below ) , the N-terminal part of hRARa ( positions 1 to 465 ) was cloned into pSGS ( 14 ) .
For this , the EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pSGS was replaced by a linker containing MscI , EcoRI , and BamHI sites ( 5'-AATTGCCACCATGGCCAGACGAATTCTCAGGATC-3 ' ) and cleaved with Mscl and EcoRI , and a Mscl-EcoRI PCR product corresponding to hRARa ( positions 1 to 465 ) was inserted .
The correctness of the sequence was confirmed by sequencing .
In a second step , the C-terminal part of RARa ( wt or mutated form ) was inserted as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment , resulting in a full-length receptor with mutants at each cysteine or arginine in the E domain .
The modification of the first two amino acids of the D domain due to the insertion of the EcoRI cloning site did not affect the transactivation efficiency , and we observed the same 50 % effective concentration ( EC , , ) for the last construct in as that for the wt hRARa .
The RAR reporter plasmid used in transactivation assays was constructed with a synthetic oligonucleotide containing three copies of the RAR response element from the RARB promoter ( 12 ) in front of the basal promoter of thymidine kinase and the luciferase coding region in the plasmid pGL2-basic ( Promega ) BRARE-thymidine kinase-luciferase .
The transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method ( 42 ) .
CV-1 cells were transiently transfected as described previously for COS cells ( 4 ) .
After addition of t-RA or Ro 13-7410 and incubation for 36 h , the luciferase activity was measured and the ECs , was calculated .
In vitro transcription , translation , and limited proteolytic digestion .
Human RARa ( wt or mutated ) in pSGS was transcribed and in vitro translated in the presence of by using rabbit reticulocyte lysates as specified by Promega .
The limited proteolytic digestions were performed as described elsewhere ( 18 ) .
RESULTS Cysteine point mutations in the E domain of hRARa « .
From the results of blocking reactions with cysteine-specific reagents , it has been previously postulated that one or several sulfhydryls are involved in ligand-hRAR « interactions ( 11 ) .
We analyzed the effect of N-ethylmaleimide and DTNB on t-RA binding with wt hRARa-LBD .
We found the same effect of t-RA on the wt receptor , consisting of a decrease in binding when increasing amounts of blocking reagent were used ( data not shown ) .
The K , , determination of wt hRAR « -LBD resulted in a value of 0.6 nM for t- RA , which establishes the functionality of the procaryotic expression and extraction methods .
The K , , correlates well with that determined previously for the full-length receptor ( 1 ) .
Each cysteine residue in the LBD of hRARa has been changed to glycine ( C-203 , C-235 , C-274 , C-333 , and C-336 [ an overview is presented in Fig .
1 ] ) .
Only the single C265G change showed a decrease of binding ( 15-fold for t-RA and 95-fold for 9-cis-RA ) as determined by Scatchard analysis ( Table 1 ) .
C-265 has also been changed to alanine .
This mutated receptor showed an IC , , of 6 nM and an 5388 LAMOUR ET AL .

antagonists that have been tested ( Table 2 ) .
The analogs Ro 41-5253 , Ro 46-5471 , and Ro 46-6464 all indicate a role for C-235 of hRARa-LBD in antagonist interaction .
Ro 41-5253 , which has a phenyl group in the upper side chain , exhibited a 60-fold higher IC , , for the mutant C235G than the wt .
In the other antagonists , changing from a six- to a seven-membered carbon ring ( Ro 46-6464 ) or removing the upper side chain phenyl group ( Ro 46-5471 ) , also resulted in a lower binding efficiency ( about 10-fold lower than the wt ) .
The use of other antagonists , in which the oxygen from the lower hydrophobic side chain was removed , gave similar results ( data not shown ) , suggesting that C-235 does not interact with the side chain oxygen .
Arginine point mutations in the E domain of hRARae .
Since the free carboxyl group on retinoids has been demonstrated to be essential for ligand binding to RARs ( 3 , 21 ) , a positively charged arginine or lysine residue interaction is very likely .
We first used 2,3-butanedione as a specific arginine-blocking reagent and found a decrease of binding of t- RA for wt hRARa-LBD in response to increasing amounts of the blocking reagent ( data not shown ) .
Subsequently , a triple mutation ( R364G , R366G , and R367G ) of arginines to glycines in the hRARa-LBD was made .
This mutated receptor exhibited no difference in binding compared with the wt ( Fig .
2A ) .
All other arginines except R-347 and R-370 , which are the only arginine residues that are not conserved among the subtypes « , B , and y ( Fig .
1 ) , were also mutated to glycine .
By Scatchard analysis of mutations with t-RA and 9-cis-RA ligands , we identified R217G , R272G , R276G , R294G , R339G , and R394G , which showed a 50- to 100-fold reduction in binding compared with the wt ( Table 1 ) , whereas R385G did not affect binding activity at all ( data not shown ) .
The binding activity of the R394G mutant was very low , and we were able to define an ICs , value only as higher than 3,000 nM for both t-RA and 9-cis-RA .
Figure 2B shows an example of K , , determination ( for R294G ) .

Saturation-binding analysis of 9-cis- [ °HJRA binding to the triple mutant hRAR « -LBD-R364G/R366G/R367G ( A ) and to the single mutant hRARa-LBD-R294G ( B ) .
Several dilutions of protein extract containing the hRARa-LBD from E. coli BL21 were used to test the binding activity to define the appropriate concentration for K , , determination .
The nonspecific binding was determined with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled RA .
For one analysis , cach point represents the average of three single values .
R276 and R394 are crucial for retinoid binding and trans-activation .
Since glycine is the smallest amino acid ( no side chain ) , we mutated all the residues mentioned above , which showed a reduction in binding affinity when changed to polar glycine , to the nonpolar alanine .
For the mutants ( R217A , R294A , and R339A ) , no influence was detectable compared with the wt , in contrast to what was seen for the glycine changes above .
The binding and transactivation activities for t-RA and Ro 13-7410 on the other mutants are shown in Table 3 .
Only a 10-fold reduction in binding efficiency was observed for mutant R272A , whereas 300- and 600-fold reductions were seen for R276A and R394A , respectively .
The R394 mutant has in addition been mutated to serine or glutamic acid , and more or less the same 600-fold decrease was observed ( Table 3 ) .
Using CV-1 cells for cotransfection of a plasmid containing the hRARa cDNA mutated at the appropriate residues , together with a reporter plasmid containing a luciferase gene under the influence of the BRARE promoter , we were able to determine the transactivation activity for hRARa .
The calculated ECs , s are in good agreement with the above-mentioned binding results ( Table 3 ) .
We have tested all mutants for their ability to bind the antagonist Ro 41-5253 ( 2 ) , as well as to other antagonists .
For most mutations , we found no effect or a reduction in the binding affinity to the same degree as for agonists ( data not shown ) .
We found the strongest effect for mutations R276A and R394A ( Table 2 ) .
The mutation R272A on hRARa exhibited only a slight effect .
For the antagonist Ro 41-5253 , we observed an IC , , of 210 nM for the mutant R272A in contrast to 48 nM for wt hRARa .
Mutations R217A and R294A in hRARa « -LBD specifically increase the binding efficiency of antagonists .
While testing all arginine mutants for their ability to bind antagonists we observed two mutants , hRAR « -R217A and hRARoe-R294A , which showed a higher binding affinity for the antagonists Ro 41-5253 , Ro 46-5471 , and Ro 46-6464 , than did the wt receptor ( Table 2 ) .
The same results were obtained with several other antagonists which we have also tested ( data not shown ) .
For all antagonists , the increase in affinity was between 2- and 12-fold for both mutants with respect to the wt .
The limited proteolytic digestion pattern of the R217A mutant for antagonists is different from that of the wt , but antagonist function is retained .
To verify the influence of the mutations on ligand function , we first checked the protection specificity by protease mapping with trypsin , chymotrypsin , and elastase .
We did not notice any difference for hRAR « -C235G and hRAR « -R294A compared with the wt ( data not shown ) .
Only for trypsin digestion of hRARa « -R217A did we find a different pattern in the presence of the antagonist Ro 41-5253 TABLE 3 .

41-5253 a 25-kDa band was protected ( lanes 6 to 8 ) as previously shown ( 18 ) .
Interestingly , this specific antagonist-induced protection changed with the hRARa-R217A mutant .
At low trypsin concentrations ( lane 14 ) , we were able to see mainly a 30-kDa band corresponding to the agonist band and a very weak lower band .
At higher trypsin concentrations ( lanes 15 to 17 ) , we saw a dose-dependent conversion of the 30-kDa agonist band to the lower 26-kDa band , which is around 1 kDa larger than the protected band in the experiments with the wt receptor .
Using the antagonist Ro 46-5471 , we found the same result ( data not shown ) .
To answer the question whether the mutation hRARa « -R217A changed the function of an antagonist into that of an agonist , we have performed transactivation experiments to verify the ability of the two antagonists to antagonize the t-RA induced transactivation of a reporter system .
The results for Ro 41-5253 are shown in Fig .
4 ( with wt and hRARa-R217A ) .
When the antagonist was used alone , for both wt and mutant receptors there was no induction of the luciferase ; at three different concentrations of t-RA ( 1 , 10 , and 100 nM ) , and increasing amounts of Ro 41-5253 , the antagonist was able to antagonize the t-RA effect with either wt or mutant receptor .
DISCUSSION The results of the present work are consistent with the crystal structure of the holo-hRARy-LBD defined by Renaud et al .
( 39 ) and provide new information about this receptor family .
A high homology has been observed between the holo-hRARy-LBD structure and the recently reported structure of apo-hRXRa-LBD ( 8 ) .
In this latter receptor , two arginine residues ( R-274 and R-278 ) integrate a cluster of positively charged residues which play a role in electrostatic guidance .
R-278 interacts specifically with the carboxyl group of t- RA .
Here , we have demonstrated that changing R-276 of hRAR « -LBD ( R-278 of hRARy ) into either a small polar glycine or small nonpolar alanine residue results in a decreased binding affinity to the mutant receptor for all ligands tested .
For all ligands tested , we have also seen a small reduction in binding affinity for the hRARa mutants at position R-272 200 100nM R217A 150 10nM Luciferase activity a G £0 OnM +/ r t t 1 -- i 1 10 100 1000 10000 Ro 41-5253 concentration ( nM ) FIG .

At 24 h after transfection , 0 , 1 , 10 , and 100 nM t-RA and increasing amounts of the antagonist Ro 41-5253 were added to the cultures ; after a 36-h incubation , the luciferase activity was measured .

16 , 1996 ( R-274 of hRARy ) .
In addition , transactivation experiments with t-RA or Ro 13-7410 showed an increase in ECs , values for both ligands , consistent with the binding activity .
This effect of residue R-272 on binding and transactivation provides functional evidence of its involvement in ligand binding .
We have clearly demonstrated that R-394 of hRARa ( R-396 of hRARy ) is a crucial residue for the binding of all ligands tested .
A mutation of the next residue , A-397 of hRARy , to threonine caused only a slight effect on binding activity ( 39 ) .
This decrease of binding could be due to the perturbation of the R-396 spatial position .
It appears that not all the residues involved in the binding pocket have the same importance for ligand binding .
R-394 of hRARa is involved in the part of the ligand-binding site close to the ring of t-RA .
Since changing R-394 into residues with different characteristics ( G , S , A , and E ) yielded the same dramatic effect and considering the spatial location of this position in the ligand-binding pocket , there are two possible explanations for the results .
It could be that this change in « -helix 11 disturbs its structural function in such a way that « -helix 12 can no longer play the `` lid role `` to close off the binding cavity .
Arguing against this hypothesis are the facts that it is still possible to transactivate the mutated receptors and that the normal agonist band is still protected in protease-mapping studies ( data not shown ) .
A more credible explanation could be that the R394 interacts via its hydrophobic portion with the t-RA ring and in this way it contributes to the high-affinity binding of the retinoid .
From our binding results of the hRARa « cysteine point mu-tant , no change in binding efficiency for single mutants was noticeable except for the mutation €265G .
For this residue , although the single alanine mutation did not significantly change the affinity of hRARa « -LBD for ligands , we did observe a strong effect for the double mutant C265G/C274G .
Interestingly , these two cysteines are both involved in « -helix 5 , which in hRARy contains hydrophobic residues interacting with the ligand-binding pocket .
We assume that the modification of both cysteines disturbs the « -helix too severely whereas each single mutation has a less dramatic effect .
In addition , a specific influence of C-235 of hRARa ( C-237 of hRARy ) on antagonist binding has been established .
For agonists , the binding affinity was the same for the C235G mutant as for the wt , whereas with antagonists , a tremendous decrease in binding affinity was shown ( Table 2 ) .
It is possible that a putative interaction involving the hydrophobic side chain , common to all the antagonists yet absent from agonists , might be disrupted by this mutation in « -helix 3 .
Furthermore , since « -helix 3 may be involved in the transconformation of « -helix 12 , which is necessary for agonist activity , the interaction of the antagonist side chain with « -helix 3 may be part of the antagonistic mechanism .
We have found that the mutation to alanine of either of two residues , R-217 and R-294 of hRARa , causes a specific increase of antagonist-binding efficiency .
This provides evidence for the distinctive implication of these two residues in antagonist binding .
According to the hRARy structure , R-217 should be located in the -loop just before the beginning of « -helix 3 and R-294 would start « -helix 6 .
From the apo-hRXRa « and holo-hRARy crystal structures , a mousetrap mechanism has been postulated to sequester the ligand and transactivate target genes via conformational changes ( 39 ) .
This change would involved the -loop flipping over « -helix 6 , which would also shift position to result in a more compact structure .
Using trypsin digestion , a specific protease-mapping pattern has been found for antagonists , giving a 25-kDa protected fragment for hRARa « versus a 30-kDa protected fragment for bound agonists ( 18 ) .
Strikingly , at the low trypsin SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS OF hRARa 5391 concentrations used , the pattern of antagonist bound to hRARa « -R217A showed two bands protected , consisting of a main 30-kDa agonist band and a new band about 1 kDa heavier than the antagonist-specific band observed with the wt receptor .
It has been previously demonstrated that the C-terminal cleavage site of the antagonist band is located between amino acids 420 and 438 ( 18 ) .
To obtain a protected fragment of 25 kDa , the N-terminal cleavage site has to be approximately at residue 210 .
The residue R-217 is located in the flexible O-loop , which should be an accessible site for trypsin cleavage .
All other sites would be less accessible for trypsin , according to the three-dimensional structure of hRARy .
We postulate that by mutating R-217 , the N-terminal trypsin cleavage site is destroyed .
In the protease mapping experiments , the next most accessible site would be preferentially cleaved at low trypsin concentration , which would correspond in our case to the agonist band ( Fig .
3 ) .
At higher concentrations , the less accessible site , located 10 residues upstream ( K-207 ) would be cleaved , yielding the 1-kDa larger band observed .
Competition experiments for transactivation between t-RA and antagonists ( Ro 41-5253 or Ro 46-5471 ) have established that hRAR « -R217A still allows these compounds to retain their antagonist activity .
It means that the antagonists are most probably still able to induce the specific antagonist conformational change .
Then , R-217 is probably the N-terminal cleavage site of trypsin in wt hRARa-bound-antagonist protection .
In addition to the role of R-394 , three residues , C-235 ( re-lated to the binding pocket ) , R-217 , and R-294 ( both of which are not related to the binding pocket ) , are implicated specifically in antagonist binding .
Interacting in stirring regions according to the three-dimensional structure of hRARy , the antagonists could block the transitional step required for transactivation activity .
We also observed a 60-fold decrease of Ro 41-5253 antagonist-binding activity for the hRAR « -C235G , whereas the R276A mutation caused only an 8-fold reduction .
Noticeably , the antagonist Ro 46-5471 showed an 11-fold reduction in binding for the C235G mutation while R276A caused a 110-fold decrease of binding activity ( Table 2 ) .
There-fore , it seems that the roles of these two residues are counterbalanced in the binding pocket depending on the chemical structure of the antagonist , giving a certain flexibility to the binding pocket and thus allowing the binding of different li-gands .
