Oncogenic Forms of NOTCH1 Lacking Either the Primary Binding Site for RBP-Jx or Nuclear Localization Sequences Retain the Ability to Associate with RBP-J and Activate ( Received for publication , December 30 , 1996 , and in revised form , January 23 , 1997 ) Jon C.

Unlike full-sized NOTCH1 , two such truncated forms of the protein either lacking a major portion of the extracellular domain ( AE ) or consisting only of the intracellular domain ( ICN ) were found to activate transcription in cultured cells , presumably through RBP-Jx response elements within DNA .
Both truncated forms also bound to the transcription factor RBP-J in extracts prepared from human and murine T-ALL cell lines .
Transcriptional activation required the presence of a weak RBP-J-binding site within the NOTCH1L ankyrin repeat region of the intracellular domain .
Unexpectedly , a second , stronger RBP-Jx-binding site , which lies within the intracellular domain close to the transmembrane region and significantly augments association with RBP-J , was not needed for oncogenesis or for transcriptional activation .
While ICN appeared primarily in the nucleus , AE localized to cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes , suggesting that intranuclear localization is not essential for oncogenesis or transcriptional activation .
In support of this interpretation , mutation of putative nuclear localization sequences decreased nuclear localization and increased transcriptional activation by membrane-bound AE .
Transcriptional activation by this mutant form of membrane-bound AE was approximately equivalent to that produced by intranuclear ICN .
These data are most consistent with NOTCH1 oncogenesis and transcriptional activation being independent of association with RBP-Jx at promoter sites .
NOTCH 1 ( also referred to as TAN-1 ) , a homolog of Drosophila NOTCH , was first identified at the breakpoint of a recurrent ( 7 ; 9 ) ( q34 ; q34.3 ) chromosomal translocation associated with a subset of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/ lymphoma ( T-ALL ) * ( 1-8 ) .

*The abbreviations used are : T-ALL , T cell leukemia/ymphoma ; ICN , intracellular domain ; GST , glutathione S-transferase ; PAGE , 113836 NOTCH 1 gene is found in most cells but is present at highest levels in developing thymus and brain ( 2 , 4 ) .
The product of this gene is a 2555 amino acid type I transmembrane receptor protein of about 350 kDa ( p350 ) containing a series of structural motifs originally described in other polypeptides ( Fig .
1 ) , including 36 epidermal growth factor-like repeats and three lin-12-like repeats in the extracellular domain and six ankyrin-like repeats in the intracellular domain .
All chromosomal breakpoints in human T-ALLs occur within a single intron dividing the coding sequence for epidermal growth factor repeat 34 and result in overexpression of novel mRNAs containing sequences from the 3 ' end of NOTCH1 ( 5 ) .
These transcripts encode a series of truncated NOTCH1 polypeptides of ~100-125 kDa lacking the epidermal growth factor-like and lin-12-like repeats ( 5 ) .
The oncogenicity of truncated NOTCH1 has been confirmed by inserting cDNAs encoding portions of the NOTCH1I gene into murine bone marrow progenitor cells which were then transplanted into syngeneic recipients ( 6 ) .
In these experiments , NOTCH1 missing the entire extracellular domain except for the leader peptide and 61 amino acids immediately external to the transmembrane region ( AE ) , or deleted for all protein sequence up to amino acid 14 of the intracellular domain ( ICN ) ( shown schematically in Fig .
1 ) induced T-ALL in ~50 % of the recipient animals .
In contrast , normal , full-length NOTCH1 produced no tumors in similar transplant experi-ments .
The tumors induced by AE contained an abundant ~120-kDa NOTCH1 that localized to perinuclear and cytoplasmic membranes , while tumors induced by ICN contained an abundant ~100-115 kDa NOTCH1 within the nucleus .
Therefore , different amino-terminal deletions created cytoplasmic and nuclear forms of truncated NOTCH1L that appeared to be equally oncogenic .
Removal of extracellular amino acid sequences from NOTCH1 and NOTCH-related proteins has effects on differentiation similar to those observed when cells expressing full-length versions of these proteins are exposed to ligand ( 7-11 ) , findings consistent with the interpretation that truncation leads to constitutive activation of the intracellular domain .
Signaling by NOTCH1L appears to be mediated , at least in part , by the transcription factor RBP-Jk ( 12-15 ) , which is homolo-gous to the proteins Su ( H ) in the Drosophila and lag-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans .
Evidence for this functional link between the proteins derives from genetic studies which have placed Drosophila NOTCH and its nematode counterparts , lin-12 and glp-1 ( 16 ) , upstream of Su ( H ) ( 17-19 ) and lag-1 ( 20 , 21 ) , respectively .
Furthermore , the murine HESI promoter polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltrans-ferase ; NLS , nuclear localization sequence .

Schematic representation of full-sized and oncogenic forms of NOTCH1L .
The scale above the diagram of full-length NOTCH1 is in codons/amino acid residues .
AE is encoded by a cDNA consisting of codons 1-22 fused to codons 1673-2555 and is predicted to result in the synthesis of a mature polypeptide with an amino terminus lying 61 amino acids external to the transmembrane domain .
ICN is encoded by a cDNA consisting of the first two codons of NOTCH1 fused to codon 1770 , which lies 18 amino acids internal to the transmembrane domain .
Structural motifs and important landmarks within these polypeptides are labeled as follows : L , leader peptide ; EGFR , epidermal growth factor-like repeats ; LNR , Lin-12-like repeats ; CC , conserved cysteine residues and Cys `` , which lie 49 and 42 amino acids external to the transmembrane domain ; TM , transmembrane domain ; tryptophan residue Trp `` ; NZ and N2 , nuclear localization signal sequences ; AR , ankyrin-like repeats ; O , opa sequence ; P , PEST sequence .
activated by NOTCH1 contains an RBP-Jr-binding site ( 22 ) , suggesting that RBP-J is also downstream of activated When overexpressed , fragments of NOTCH1 representing the intracellular domain can associate with RBP-J bound to DNA ( 22 ) , and when tethered to a promoter by covalent linkage to a DNA-binding protein , NOTCH1 has transactivating effects ( 5 , 23 ) , indicating that NOTCH1 might transactivate through physical interaction with RBP-Jx bound to promoter elements .
If this mechanism of transactivation were involved in NOTCH1L transformation , it might be expected that subcellular localization would influence oncogenicity .
However , AE transforms as well as ICN despite its cytoplasmic localization .
Moreover , based on studies performed in transiently overexpressing cells , NOTCH1 association with RBP-J has been reported to require a tryptophan residue ( Trp'*'* `` ) lying 10 amino acids internal to the transmembrane domain that is absent from ICN ( 24 ) .
These discrepancies raised the possibility that NOTCH1L oncogenicity might not involve RBP-Jx or nuclear localization .
To investigate these possibilities , we have evaluated the physical and functional interaction of RBP-J and NOTCH1 in a variety of cell types , including NOTCH1-induced T-ALL cell lines .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Antibodies-Production , purification , and characterization of polyclonal rabbit antibodies against two portions of the intracellular domain of NOTCH1 ( 25 ) , T3 ( amino acids 1763-1877 ) and TC ( amino acids 2277-2470 ) , and an amino-terminal portion of RBP-J ( 26 ) , have been previously described .
Cell Lines-Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technolo-gies .
All cell lines were cultured at 37°C under 5 % CO , .
SUP-T1 , a human T lymphoblastic cell line containing two copies of a balanced ( 7 ; 9 ) ( q84 ; q84.3 ) chromosomal translocation and no normal chromosome 9 ( 27 ) was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
T6E and 122 cells , derived from murine tumors induced by cDNAs encoding AE and ICN ( 6 ) , respectively , were grown in RPMI supplemented with 20 % fetal calf serum and interleukin-2 ( 4 units/ml ) .
Human embryonic kidney 298 cells and two cell lines derived from 298 cells , 293T and Bosc23 ( 28 ) , were all grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
cDNA Expression Constructs-The cDNA constructs NOTCHL ( codons 1-2555 ) , AE ( codons 1-22 fused to codons 1673-2555 ) , AEAAR ( a subclone of AE with a deletion removing codons 1858-2206 ) , ICN ( codons 1770-2555 ) , and ICNANIAN2 ( a subclone of ICN with two deletions removing codons 1771-1857 ( AN1 ) and codons 2097-2204 11337 ( AN2 ) ) have been previously described ( 5 , 6 ) .
Additional subclones with mutations and small deletions in potential nuclear localization signal sequences were made by ligating polymerase chain reaction products with compatible restriction sites to the ICN and AE constructs .
The construct ICNW was created by ligating a double stranded DNA linker containing nucleotides -15 to +6 ( relative to the NOTCH1 start codon ) to the ICN construct after digestion with the restriction enzymes and BamHI .
A cDNA construct encoding RBP-Jr3 in the eukaryotic expression plasmid pSGS5 has been previously described ( 15 ) .
To express RBP-Jx8 with a mye epitope tag , the cDNA was excised from pSGS5 as a BamHI-Sfel restriction fragment and subcloned using a Sfel/NotI adaptor into a derivative of pecDNAS that encodes three iterated copies of a myc epitope .
The resultant fusion cDNA encodes RBP-Jx8 with mye epitopes replacing the six most carboxyl-terminal amino acids ( RBP-Jk3-myc ) .
Production of GST Fusion Polypeptides-Expression and purification of GST-NOTCH1 ankyrin repeat ( 5 ) ( codons 1872-2123 ) and GST-RBP-Jx8 ( 26 ) fusion proteins have been described .
A cDNA spanning the region encoding the NOTCH2 ankyrin repeats ( codons 9-271 in the sequence of Stifani et al .
( 29 ) ) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a human umbilical vein encdothelial cell cDNA library ( 30 ) as template .
After subcloning into pGEX-2TK ( Pharmacia ) , GST-NOTCH2 ankyrin repeat fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia ) as described for the NOTCH1 ankyrin repeats ( 5 ) .

A 1.1-kilobase Neo !
fragment encoding the NOTCH1 ankyrin repeats and immediate flanking sequences ( codons 1858-2206 ) was subcloned into the Nco !
site of the plasmid pAS2 , while a Ncol-BamHI fragment containing the complete cDNA for RBP-Jx was subcloned into the Ncol-BamHI site of the plasmid pAC-TIL Yeast strain Y190 was transformed with pASZ2-AR1 and selected on Trp- plates , and then retransformed with pACTII-RBP-Jk3 and selected on Trp-Leu-agar plates in the presence of 25 mM S-aminotriazole .
Resultant colonies were then stained for B-galactosidase activity using 5-bromo-4-chloro-8-indoyl B-D-galactoside as substrate .

After addition of Polybrene ( 4 ug/m !
1 ) , the resultant supernatants containing retrovirus were used to infect NIH 3T3 cells .
For transient expression , cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA ( Invitrogen ) and transfected into cultured cells by calcium phosphate precipitation ( 28 ) .
Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase ( CAT ) Assays-Various NOTCH1L cDNAs cloned into peDNAS8 were used in co-transfections of 298 cells along with a CAT reporter containing a concatamerized sequence derived from the DNA of the Epstein-Barr virus Cpl promoter ( 83 ) , and an internal control cDNA encoding B-galactosidase expressed from a glucokinase housekeeping promoter .
Cell extracts were routinely prepared 48 h post-transfection and analyzed for B-galactosidase and CAT activity according to standard protocols ( 84 ) .
CAT activities were normalized with respect to B-galactosidase activity and quantitated by comparison to results of control transfections performed with peDNAS lacking a cDNA insert and the reporter construct .

In each binding assay , 10 pl of `` S-labeled in vitro translated NOTCH1 was precleared with 25 ul of GST glutathione beads and then allowed to mix with 25 ul of GST glutathione-Sepharose beads or RBP-Jk8-GST glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h.

In vitro translated RBP-Jk8 ( 10 wl ) was mixed with 2.5 ul of GST , GST-NOTCH1 ankyrin repeat ( AR1 ) , or GST-NOTCH2 ankyrin repeat ( AR2 ) glutathione-Sepharose beads , each having ~12.5 ug of bound fusion protein .
Binding , elution , and analysis of bound proteins was performed as described in B and C. The input lane represents 1 % of the total protein .
forms of NOTCH1 , immunoprecipitates were prepared from lysates of human SUP-T1 cells , which contain two copies of the t ( 7 ; 9 ) and no normal chromosome 9 , from lysates of T6E cells , which are derived from a T cell tumor induced by a retrovirus containing the AE cDNA , and from lysates of 122 cells , which are derived from a T cell tumor induced by a retrovirus containing the ICN cDNA .
Human T cells contain two major RBP-Jx isoforms , J « 1 and Jx3 , created by alternative splicing of the 5 exon .
Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates prepared from SUP-T1l cells ( Fig .
24 ) demonstrated that RBP-Jk3 and trace amounts of were co-precipitated by affinity-purified antibodies against two different portions of the intracellular domain of NOTCH1 , while neither isoform was precipitated by control affinity-purified antibody against GST .
Since approximately equal amounts of RBP-J « 1 and RBP-Jk3 were precipitated by anti-RBP-Jx , enrichment for RBP-J « 3 in the NOTCH1 immunoprecipitates probably reflects a greater association of RBP-Jx3 with NOTCH1 , as has been previously noted with Epstein-Barr virus transcriptional regulators EBNAZ and EBNAS3C ( 36 ) .

Co-precipitation of NOTCH1 and RBP-J « mye from lysates of transiently overexpressing 293T cells demonstrating the requirement for the region of NOTCH1 containing Trp ' `` `` `` .
A , lysates prepared from 298T cells co-transfected 10 pg of peDNAS-RBP-J « k3mye and 5 ug of pcDNAS8-NOTCH1 ( 7 ) , peDNAS-AE ( 2 ) , peDNAS-ICNW ( 3 ) , or peDNAS-ICN ( 4 ) were divided into two aliquots that were incubated with either protein A-Sepharose beads or protein A-Sepharose beads containing pre-bound anti-mye 9610 antibody .
Precipitated polypeptides were separated by electrophoresis in a 8 % polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose .
A Western blot is shown that was stained with anti-T3 NOTCH1 antibody ( upper panel ) , then stripped and restained with antiserum to RBP-J « 8 { lower panel ) .
The input lane contains 1 % of the total lysate .
In B , three dishes of 298T cells were transfected with 5 ug of peDNA3-NOTCH1 , 10 ug of peDNAS-RBP-J « k8mye , or 5 ug of pecDNAS8-NOTCH1 and 10 ug of peDNAS-RBP-Jk3mye .
Cells transfected with peDNAS-NOTCH1 or peDNAS-RBP-J « k3myc alone were subsequently mixed into a single cell pellet .
Lysates of the mixture of singly transfected cells ( I ) and of co-transfected cells ( 2 ) were prepared in a large volume ( 5 ml ) to minimize association ex vivo .
Polypeptides immunoprecipitated from lysates with anti-myc 9E10 antibody were separated by electrophoresis in a 8 % polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose .
The resultant Western blot was divided into an upper half that was stained with anti-T8 NOTCH1 antibody ( upper panel ) and a lower half that was stained with anti-myec 9E10 antibody ( ower panel ) .
The input lane contains 0.4 % of the total lysate .
NOTCH1 antibody but not with anti-GST antibody .
The extent of RBP-Jx association with NOTCH1 forms in SUP-T1 , T6E , and 122 cells was substantial , since NOTCH1 antibody precipitated much more than 1 % of the RBP-Jk3 and approximately as much as with the RBP-Jx antibody .
In converse experiments , RBP-J « -specific antibody immunoprecipitated NOTCH1 ( Fig .
2B ) .
From SUP-TIl cell lysates , multiple t ( 7 ; 9 ) -specific polypeptides of 100-125 kDa co-precipitated with RBP-Jr-specific antibody .
From T6E lysates , a 120-kDa NOTCH1 corresponding in size to AE co-precipitated with RBP-J antibody , as did smaller amounts of a 350-kDa cross-reactive polypeptide .
The 350-kDa polypeptide was recognized by multiple NOTCH1 antibodies and is identical in size to human p350 ( not shown ) .
Several NOTCH1 polypeptides from 122 lysates were also co-precipitated with RBP-J antibody , with the largest being slightly smaller than AE , as expected for ICN .
The Ankyrin Repeat Region of NOTCH1 Binds RBP-Jk3-ICN precipitated with RBP-J antibody even though it lacks the residue Trp ' `` `` `` previously shown to be important in NOTCH1 association with RBP-J both in vitro and in transiently transfected cells ( 24 ) .

Activation of transcription from a Cpl promoter element by oncogenic forms of NOTCH1 .
293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding various forms of NOTCH1 , RBP-J « 8 , a CAT reporter linked to eight iterated copies of an RBP-Jr-binding sequence from the Cpl promoter , and B-galactosidase under the control of the galactokinase promoter .
Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection .

B , comparison of transactivation by ICNW , ICN , or ICNANL .
Results represent the mean of four transfections .
The amount of each plasmid used was 6 ug/dish .
sis for the association of ICN with RBP-Jx , various forms of NOTCH1 ( shown schematically in Fig .
3A ) were expressed in vitro and tested for binding to RBP-J « 3-GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads .
As expected , ICNW , a polypeptide consisting of the entire intracellular domain of NOTCH1L and differing from ICN by only nine amino acids at the amino terminus ( Fig .
3A ) , bound RBP-Jx-GST more strongly than ICN ( Fig .
3B ) .
However , when compared with the level of binding observed with control GST beads , ICN also bound specifically to RBP-J « -GST ( Fig .
3C ) .
Binding was enhanced by deletion of regions flanking the ankyrin repeats ( ICNANIAN2 in Fig .
3C ) and abolished by a deletion that removed the ankyrin repeats ( ICNAAR in Fig .
3C ) .
The isolated ankyrin repeats of NOTCH1 and of a closely related human homolog , NOTCH2 , also bound in vitro translated in amounts above that observed with the GST control ( Fig .
3D ) , indicating the presence of a weak RBP-Jr-binding site within the ankyrin repeat region that has been conserved during divergence of these two mammalian NOTCH receptors .
The ankyrin repeat region of NOTCH1 was also found to interact strongly with RBP-Jx in the yeast two-hybrid assay ( Table 1 ) , as ~90 % of colonies co-transformed with pAS2-AR1 and pACTII-RBP-J « 3 showed high level expression of a 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 11340 A Fou Fic .

Representative immunostaining patterns are shown for : ICN ( A ) ; ICNANZ.1 ( B ) ; ICNMNI1AN2Z.1 D ( C ) ; ICNMNIMN2a ( D ) ; and ICNMN- 1MN2c ( E ) .

B-galactosidase reporter gene .
In contrast , no B-galactosidase expression was observed when a control cDNA encoding an unrelated protein , yeast SNF1 , was substituted for AR1 or RBP-Jk3 .
Therefore , the ankyrin repeat region of NOTCH1L contains a second binding site for RBP-Jx that could mediate stable association of ICN and RBP-Jx in 122 cells .
Trp `` ' Is Needed for Stable Association of NOTCH1 and RBP-J in Transiently Expressing 293 Cells-To further investigate the RBP-J « binding sites of NOTCH1 , immunoprecipitates were prepared from lysates of 2983 cells transiently expressing myc epitope-tagged RBP-Jk3 and various forms of NOTCH1I .
NOTCH1 , AE , and ICNW all co-precipitated with anti-mye antibody ( Fig .
44 , lanes 1-3 , respectively ) , as did AEAAR ( not shown ) , while ICN did not co-precipitate in detectable amounts ( Fig .
44 , lane 4 ) .
These data indicate that the binding site containing Trp `` is necessary and sufficient for stable association in transiently expressing cells .
In contrast , stable association of RBP-J « through the ankyrin repeat region is not detectable in transiently expressing 293 cells .
Co-precipitation of membrane-bound forms of NOTCH1 ( full-sized NOTCH1 and AE ) in T cell lines and transiently expressing 293 cells suggested that RBP-J can associate with NOTCH1 in the cytoplasm .
Alternatively , association might occur ex vivo after cell lysis .
To distinguish between these possibilities , immunoprecipitates were prepared from lysates of cells co-expressing NOTCH1L and RBP-J « 3 ( Fig .
4B , lane 2 ) and mixtures of cells expressing either full-size NOTCH1L or RBP-Jk3 ( Fig .
4B , lane 1 ) .
Co-precipitation of NOTCH1 and RBP-J « mye with mye antibody was only observed in lysates prepared from co-expressing cells , consistent with RBP-J « 3 : NOTCH1 complexes being formed in the cytoplasm of intact cells .

Transient expression of AE and ICN in 293 cells activated transcription - 8-12-fold , whereas - full-length NOTCH1 had no effect ( Fig .
5A ) .
Although a plasmid encoding RBP-Jx3 was routinely included in these transfections , similar results were obtained when this plasmid was excluded , probably because endogenous levels in 298 cells are sufficient for full activation . ``
ICN was slightly more active than AE in all experiments ( p < 0.06 ) .
AEAAR , deleted for the ankyrin repeats , had only 20 % of the activity of AE , consistent with a key role for the ankyrin repeat region in transcriptional activation .
In contrast , ICNW , ICN , and ICNAN1 stimulated transcription to a similar degree ( Fig .
5B ) , despite the absence of Trp `` from ICN and ICNAN1 .
Therefore , the strong -J-binding site around Trp `` is not required for transcriptional or oncogenic activity .
Transcriptional Activation Is Not Dependent on Nuclear Lo-calization-Activation of transcription using the RBP-Jx binding element of Cpl promoter by AE and ICN , but not by NOTCH1 , indicated that deletion of the extracellular domain resulted in activation of transcription through RBP-J .
Since AE localizes predominantly to cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes , intranuclear localization may not be required for its effects .
Alternatively , a small amount of AE , but not NOTCH1 , might be cleaved within the intracellular domain , freeing it from membranes and enabling it to up-regulate transcription through RBP-J bound to DNA .
If NOTCH1 must first trans-locate to the nucleus to be active , mutation of the putative NOTCH1 nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ) should inhibit transactivation and ICN should be a more potent transactiva-tor than AE .

Confocal immunolocalization of NOTCH1I .
The upper panel shows 298 cells transfected with peDNAS-NOTCH1 ( NOTCH1 ) , peDNAS-AEMNIAN2.1 ( AE-N ) , or peDNA8-ICNW ( JICNW ) that have been stained with anti-T3 NOTCH1 antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit antibody linked to fluorescein isothiocyanate .
The lower panel shows a phase-contrast image of the same cells .
signal sequences of NOTCH1 were mapped by mutational analysis in NIH 3T3 cells ( Fig .
6 , A-E , summarized in Fig .
6F ) , and NLS mutations were then evaluated for effects on transactivation by ICN and AE .
Previous work has indicated the existence of at least one sequence amino-terminal and one sequence carboxyl-terminal of the ankyrin repeats with NLS activity ( 5 , 37 ) .
The N1 region amino-terminal to the ankyrin repeats contains two potential NLSs , Lys* `` `` `` -Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg `` * and Lys'* `` °-Lys-Phe-Arg-Phe-Glu'* > `` , while the region carboxyl-terminal to the ankyrin repeats contains two closely spaced stretches of basic amino acids , Lys® `` `` `` -Lys-Val-Arg-Lys `` `` * `` `` and Lys* `` `` `` -Ala-Arg-Arg-Lys-Lys `` ** `` .
When coupled with a deletion termed AN2.1 that removed amino acids 2158-2206 , mutation of the sequence to LEFRFE ( termed MN1 ) led to a marked increase in cytoplasmic localization ( Fig .
6C ) , with most cells showing approximately equal cytoplasmic and nuclear staining .
Amino acid residues 1820-1825 ( designated N1 ) are conserved among all members of the vertebrate NOTCH receptor family ( Table II ) .
In contrast , deletion of the second amino-terminal basic sequence , Lys* ' `` `` `` -Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg `` `` `` `` , had no additional effect on localization , either in concert with AN2.1 alone or together with MN1 and ANZ.1 ( not shown ) .
When coupled with MN1 , mutation Lys® `` `` `` -Lys-Val-Arg-Lys® `` `` to KEFRK ( designated MN2a , Fig .
6D ) or mutation of Lys `` `` `` `` -Ala-Arg-Arg-Lys-Lys `` `` ** `` to KARRGT ( designated MN2c , Fig .
66 ) increased cytoplasmic localization , indicating that these two basic sequences may function as a bipartite NLS .
This sequence , designated N2 , is also conserved ( Table II ) .

Equivalent transcriptional activation by nuclear and extranuclear forms of amino-terminally deleted NOTCH1I .
A , effect on transcriptional activation generated by mutations in the NOTCH1 nuclear localization sequence .
298 cells were co-transfected with 6 ug of various NOTCH cDNAs in peDNA8 , pSG5-RBP-J « 8 , CAT reporter carrying eight iterated copies of an RBP-J-binding element from the Cpl promoter , and a B-galactosidase internal control .
Results shown are the mean of four transfections .
Statistical comparison of the mean activation by AE and AEMN1ANZ.1 was performed using the Student 's ¢ test .
B , comparison of transcriptional activation produced by transfection with peDNAS-ICNW and peDNAS-AEMN1AN2.1 .
Results shown are the mean of four transfections for each dose of input plasmid .
Input of the other three plasmids was 6 ug , as described in A .
C , comparison of protein expression produced by transfection with peDNAS-ICNW and peDNAS-AEMNIANZ.1 .
Levels of cross-reactive protein produced by transfection with 0.1 ug of peDNAS-AEMN1AN2.1 ( 1 ) or peDNAS-ICNW ( 2 ) were compared on a Western blot stained with anti-T3 NOTCH1 antibody .
CAT assay results ( A and B ) and the amount of protein loaded ( C ) were normalized for variation in B-galactosidase levels .
Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection .
abolished nuclear staining , consistent with previous reports that the ankyrin repeat region has some intrinsic capacity for nuclear localization ( 37 ) .
No attempt was made to further reduce nuclear localization through ankyrin repeat mutations , since involvement of this region in binding and activation of RBP-J would confound interpretation of `` loss-of-function `` mutations .
To produce a truncated NOTCH1 with limited ( if any ) capacity for nuclear localization , MN1 and AN2.1 were subcloned into AE to create AEMNLAN2.1 .
Localization of various forms of NOTCH1 in transiently expressing 293 cells was then determined by confocal microscopy ( Fig .
7 ) .
Inactive , full-sized NOTCH1 localized to perinuclear regions and cytoplasmic vesicles ( Fig .
7A ) .
Cells expressing AEMNIAN2.1 showed staining of nuclear membrane and variable perinuclear staining compatible with endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi , with no detectable nuclear staining ( Fig .
7B ) .
In contrast , ICNW produced exclusively nuclear staining ( Fig .
7C ) .
The effect of NLS mutations on transcriptional activation was then determined in transient transfection studies using 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 11342 293 cells ( Fig .
8A ) .
ICNMNI1AN2.1 had similar activity to ICN , whereas AEMNIANZ.1 unexpectedly had consistently increased activity relative to AE ( p < 0.05 ) .
This increase in activity was probably not due to diminished nuclear localization per se , because a derivative of AEMNIAN2.1 with a functional SV40 NLS sequence inserted into the AN2.1 site maintained levels of transactivation similar to AEMNIANZ.1 ( not shown ) .
To compare the potency of nuclear and membrane-bound versions of truncated NOTCH1 , transactivation by ICNW and AEMNIANZ.1 was measured over a range of input plasmid ( Fig .
8B ) .
Both constructs had similar dose-response curves , with a trend toward slightly higher stimulation with ICNW at low input levels of plasmid .
However , AEMNIAN2.1 ( Fig .
8C , lane 1 ) also produced less protein than ICNW at low levels of input plasmid , ( Fig .
8C , lane 2 ) , suggesting that minor differences in transactivation could result from differences in protein level rather than differences in potency .
These data indicate that both intranuclear and extranuclear forms of truncated NOTCH1 transactivate the Cpl promoter , suggesting that transactivation may not require association of NOTCH1L and RBP-J at promoter sites .
DISCUSSION Recurrent , specific chromosomal translocations found in tumors frequently exert their oncogenic effects by increasing some normal activity associated with the proteins encoded by genes located at the translocation breakpoints .
It seems likely that this theme will extend to the role of truncated NOTCH1 in T cell neoplasia since normal NOTCH1 is highly expressed in thymocytes ; oncogenic forms of NOTCH1 exhibit `` gain-of-func-tion `` activity in various assays of transcription and differenti-ation ; and these gain-of-function forms are particularly oncogenic in T cell progenitors .
However , the precise mechanism by which truncated NOTCH1 contributes to tumor development is not clear and may be complex .
Besides interacting physically and functionally with RBP-Jk , NOTCH1 also interacts with components of the NF- « B signaling pathway ( 5 , 38 ) and some NOTCH phenotypes in the fly appear to be independent of Su ( H ) ( 18 ) .
The data presented here indicate that the oncogenic capacity of truncated NOTCH1L may be mediated at least in part by RBP-Jx .
In this regard , it is relevant that four Epstein-Barr viral proteins required for B cell transformation , EBNA2Z ( 39 ) , EBNASA , EBNA3B , and EBNAS3C ( 26 ) , bind to and alter the activity of RBP-Jx ( 14 , 15 , 26 , 40-47 ) .
Extensive binding of these transforming proteins with RBP-J is also found in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes ( 86 ) .
Since viral transforming proteins often associate with and dysregulate molecules which seem to have general functions in the control of normal cell proliferation , it may be that RBP-Jx has a critical role in T cell transformation as well as in B cell transformation induced by Epstein-Barr virus .
For similar reasons , dysregula-tion of RBP-J may be involved in neoplasms beyond the lymphoid system , and abnormal NOTCH1 signaling could be a factor in this process .
Based on our data , the ankyrin repeat region of NOTCH1 is important for transactivation of promoters , whereas neither the strong RBP-J binding site around amino acid residue Trp `` ( a domain termed RAM23 by Tamura et al .
( 24 ) ) nor nuclear localization of NOTCH1 is required .
A major role for the ankyrin repeats in the effects of NOTCH1L has been previously indicated by studies showing that a point mutation in the fourth ankyrin repeat prevented transactivation of RBP-J ( 22 ) and inhibition of myogenesis ( 48 ) by NOTCH1 , and that a peptide consisting of the ankyrin repeats of glp-1 and immediate flanking sequences was sufficient to produce a gain-of-function phenotype during development in C. elegans ( 49 ) .
Assuming that the basic mechanism of NOTCH signaling has Functional Activity of Mutant NOTCH1 been conserved during vertebrate evolution , this latter finding supports the possibility that association of RBP-Jr with the ankyrin repeat region is involved in and may be sufficient for some level of transactivation .
Our observation that the region containing Trp ' `` * `` and the RAM23 domain ( defined as amino acids 1758-1857 ) is not required for transactivation is consistent with experiments showing that murine ICN lacking amino acids 1758-1818 inhibited myogenic differentiation of NIH 3T3 cells ( 37 ) , and that human ICN lacking amino acids 1758-1770 inhibited ganglion cell differentiation in the developing chick retina ( 11 ) .
In the latter of these two studies , the effects of ICN were mimicked by exposure of cells expressing the full-sized NOTCH1 receptor to the NOTCH ligand DELTA , suggesting that Trp ' `` `` `` is not required for production of a bona fide NOTCH1 signal .
Simi-larly , we have recently observed that the inhibitory effect of ICNANL ( which lacks amino acids 1758-1857 ) on myogenic differentiation of murine C2C12 cells is mimicked by treatment of these cells with the ligands produced by the human JAGGED and SERRATE genes . ``
Since it seems unlikely that binding of RBP-J to the RAM23 sequence of NOTCH1I is without functional significance , alternative functions for this sequence other than a direct role in activation of RBP-Jx need to be considered .
One possible function for RAM23 would be to serve as a docking site for RBP-J with normal , full-sized NOTCH1 .
Upon binding of ligand to the extracellular domain of NOTCH1 , this pool of pre-associated RBP-Jx could then be activated through a mechanism involving the ankyrin repeat binding site .
The strong oncogenic and transactivating activity of mem-brane-tethered forms of NOTCH1L ( AE ) and the failure to detect processing of AE to a nuclear polypeptide in either T6E T-ALL cells or transiently expressing 293 cells implies that nuclear localization is not required for NOTCH1 oncogenesis or transactivation of the Cpl promoter .
This interpretation is consistent with the observation that among normal tissues in invertebrates and vertebrates , intranuclear NOTCH1 has been detected in only a small population of post-mitotic retinal cells in the rat ( 50 ) .
Hence , while intranuclear forms of NOTCH ( 7 , 8 , 51 , 52 ) and NOTCH1 ( 6 , 37 , 48 ) produce gain-of-function phenotypes in a variety of assays , intranuclear localization may not be essential for function .
The conclusion that nuclear localization of NOTCH1 is nonessential for at least some functions of NOTCH1 conflicts with one model for NOTCH1 signaling based on observations made using a slightly different form of AE , termed AE-C , lacking two conserved extracellular cysteine residues , Cys® `` * `` and Cys ! ``
Unlike AE , which contains these two cysteine residues , transient expression of AE-C is accompanied by proteolytic processing to smaller polypeptides that localize to the nucleus and associate with RBP-J , suggesting that polypeptides derived from AE-C transactivate by direct physical interaction with RBP-J bound to DNA ( 22 , 35 ) .
Failure to detect similar processing of AE could be explained if Cys and Cys* `` influence proteolytic processing but not transactivation or oncogenesis per se .
In support of this possibility , AE-C-induced T cell tumors contain a series of lower molecular weight polypeptides cross-reactive with NOTCH1 antibody that are absent from AE-induced T cell tumors ( 6 ) and also show nuclear staining with anti-NOTCH1 antibodies that is not observed in AF-in-duced tumors . ``
AFE and AE-C are equally potent oncoproteins ( 6 ) , however , so the observed differences in proteolytic processing and subcellular localization do not appear to affect transforming activity .

610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog Functional Activity of Mutant NOTCH1 In contrast to the nuclear translocation model for NOTCHL signaling , our data pertaining to NOTCH1L oncogenesis and transactivation are generally consistent with an alternative signaling model based on observations made in Drosophila .
This model proposes that transient association of Su ( H ) and NOTCH in the cytoplasm results in transactivation through Su ( H ) without nuclear translocation of NOTCH ( 53 ) .
One important additional factor in this activation pathway is deltex , a protein found in Drosophila that binds the ankyrin repeats of NOTCH ( 54 ) .
Deltex can displace Su ( H ) from the ankyrin repeats and is a positive regulator of NOTCH signaling ( 55 , 56 ) , indicating the existence of factors that promote dissociation of NOTCH and Su ( H ) yet enhance transactivation .
Conceivably , cell type-specific variation in expression levels of deltex-like factors could result in stable association of ICN with RBP-Jx in some cell types ( e.g .
122 cells ) but not others ( e.g .
transiently expressing 293 cells ) .
A critical question not explained by this model is whether Su ( H ) activation stems from post-transla-tional modification or from association with unknown accessory factors .
Further elucidation of the mechanism of NOTCH1L transactivation will require identification of mammalian accessory factors and additional investigation of the effects of acti- vated NOTCH1 on RBP-Jx .
