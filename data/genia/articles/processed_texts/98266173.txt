6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; Overexpression of p65 and c-Jun Substitutes for B7-1 Costimulation by Targeting the CD28RE Within the IL-2 Promoter ' Eduardo Parra , * Kathleen McGuire , `` Gunnar Hedlund , * `` and Mikael Dohlsten `` ** The role of Rel and activation protein-1 ( AP-1 ) in IL-2 promoter activity in B7-1- and leukocyte function-associated Ag-3 ( LFA-3 ) -costimulated T cells has been evaluated .
We demonstrate that overexpression of c-Jun but not c-Fos increases IL-2 promoter activity in both B7-1- and LFA-3-costimulated Jurkat T cells .
Cotransfection of both c-Jun and c-Fos substitutes for B7-1 costimulation in driving an activation protein-1 response element but not for the IL-2 promoter .
Overexpression of Rel proteins demonstrated that p6S-expressing Jurkat cells transcribed equally well a nuclear factor xB reporter construct when costimulated with B7-1 or LFA-3 , but transcription of IL-2 promoter or CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) -driven reporters was superior in B7-1-costimulated cells .
Combined expression of c-Jun and p65 induced vigorous transcription of IL-2 promoter- and CD28RE-driven reporter constructs in both LFA-3- and B7-1-costimulated Jurkat cells .
Mutating the CD28RE but not the upstream nuclear factor « f3-binding site in the IL-2 promoter reduced B7-1-driven transcription > 90 % .
The results implicates a major role of the CD28RE in the integration of p65/c-Jun-mediated transcription within the IL-2 promoter .
We suggest that the transition from an autocrine LFA-3-driven immune response to a B7 -- induced paracrine immune response involves the activation of c-Jun and p65 , which target the CD28RE region of the IL-2 promoter .
cient for activation of cytokine production and cell prolif- eration ( 1-3 ) .
Second signals provided by the APC are required to promote complete T cell activation .
These signals result from the interaction of cell surface protein ligands such as B7-1 ( CD80 ) , B7-2 CD86 ) , or LFEA-3 ( CD58 ) on the APCs with the corresponding CD28 or CD2 receptors on T cells ( 4-12 ) .
The complete activation of T cells leads to induction of IL-2 and IL-2R gene expression and subsequent cell division .
IL-2 gene expression is regulated by its 5'-promoter sequence , and its critical regulatory and inducible activity is contained within the 300-bp region immediately upstream of the start site .
The IL-2 promoter includes defined binding sites for the transcription factors NF-AT , `` NF-KB , AP-1 , Oct-1 , and CD28RC ( 13-16 ) .
The NF- « B/Re !
family of transcription factors has been shown by several laboratories to be important to IL-2 promoter activity .
These transcription factors share the conserved Rel homology do-main , involved in specific DNA binding and dimerization ( 17 ) .
Rel proteins interact with the regulatory elements of many different inducible immune response genes .
The NF- « B/Re !
family of transcription factors includes p50 p52 ( NFxB2 ) , p65 ( Rel A ) , Rel B , and c-Rel ( 18-20 ) .
p65 and c-Rel contain different and unique C-terminal transcription activation domains ( 21-23 ) .

( 24 ) proteins contain a potent franms-activating capacity .
In contrast , the p50 ( 25 , 26 ) subunit shows a substantial DNA-binding capacity and low transcriptional activity , suggesting a role for p50 homodimers in repressing p65- and c-Rel-responsive genes .
The NF-KB proteins are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive state by complex formation with the IxB-inhibitory subunits ( 27 , 28 ) .
Cell activation induces the phosphorylation of IxB-a and its subsequent proteolytic degradation ( 29 ) .
The NF- « B complex is dissociated from the negative regulator IB , is translocated to the nucleus , and binds to the xB decameric sequence motif ( 25 , 27-29 ) .
The CD28RE within the IL-2 promoter contains a sequence similar to but not identical with the B site ( 30 ) .
Several studies have demonstrated that members of the NF- « B/Re !
family proteins are involved in the nuclear protein complex that binds to the CD28RE , suggesting that this response element is a modified « B response motif ( 31-33 ) .
CD28RE was originally defined in the IL-2 promoter as a major and unique response element for the CD28/B7-1 signal transduction pathway ( 31 ) .
However , recent data suggest that induction of nuclear proteins binding to CD28RE is not entirely exclusive for the CD28 pathway ( 16 , 34 , 35 ) and similar sequences have been identified in other promoters like IL-3 and GM-CSF ( 30 , 36 ) .
Recently , we reported that B7-1 costimulation induced the presence of a c-Rel-containing CD28RC complex ( 16 ) and this has been seen by other laboratories as well ( 35 ) .
The AP-1 transcription factors are composed of Jun and Fos proteins that function as transcriptional regulators in a het-erodimeric complex ( 37-39 ) .
The members of this transcription factor family together with ATF , CREB , and others belong to the class of basic-leucine zipper ( bZIP ) proteins .
Following cell acti-vation , members of the Jun family ( c-Jun , Jun D , and Jun B ) form complexes with various partners of the Fos family ( c-Fos , Fos B , Fra-1 , and Fra-2 ) .
The formation of heterodimers seems to increase their transcriptional activity ( 40 ) .
The c-Jun but not the c-Fos protein may also form homodimers .
However , the heterodimers formed by one member of each family display higher DNA-binding capacity and frams-activating properties than homodimers 0022-1767/98/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; The Journal of Immunology formed by the Jun family members .
The consensus AP-1-binding site has been identified in several genes involved in T cell activation ( 37-39 ) .
The AP-1 proteins have been demonstrated to complex with NF-AT , NF- « B , and Oct-1 proteins , suggesting that AP-1 may act in concert with other transcription factors to regulate a variety of response elements ( 41-46 ) .
To elucidate the role of Rel and AP-1 proteins in costimulation of T cells , we used a model with Jurkat T cells and CHO cells transfected with HLA-DR , B7-1 , and LFA-3 as APCs .
Transient transfection of Jurkat cells with IL-2 promoter AP-1 , NF-kB and CD28RE-driven reporter combined with Rel and AP-1 expression plasmids was performed to study the role of these proteins in IL-2 promoter transcription .
We now demonstrate that c-Jun functionally cooperates with p65 in superinducing the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter .
Indeed , c-Jun/p65-expressing Jurkat cells responded equally well to B7-1 and LFA-3 costimulation .
The CD28RE seemed to be crucial for p65/c-Jun effects , since a mutation in this site completely abrogated the superinduction of IL-2 promoter activity .
The data suggest that the CD28RE , flanked by an AP-1 element , integrates AP-1 and Rel nuclear factor pathways to transfer T cells from an autocrine to a paracrine immune response .
Materials and Methods Reagents SEE was purchased from Toxin Technology ( Madison , WI ) .
Luciferase assay reagent , reporter lysis buffer 5X , and the pGL2 luciferase basic vector were purchase from Promega ( Madison , WI ) .
rIL-2 was obtained from Cetus ( Emeryville , CA ) .
Transfected cell lines CHO cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the human HLA-DR4 , B7-1 , and LFA-3 cell surface molecules , as described in detail elsewhere ( 12 , 47 ) .
Single , double , and triple transfectants expressing similar levels of the transfected molecules were established by repeated cell sortings .
The surface expression of HLA-DR , LFA-3 , and B7-1 was confirmed regularly by FACS analysis .
Cell culture and transfection All experiments were done using the human T-cell Jurkat , which responds with a pattern of IL-2 production similar to those of B7-1 and LFA-3 costimulation as normal human T cells ( 16 ) .
The human Jurkat leukemia T cell line was maintained in culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10 % FBS ( complete medium ) .
All tests on the Jurkat T cells were performed at a concentration of 1 X 10° cells/ml in complete me-dium .
The transfected CHO cells were irradiated ( 8000 rad ) and added to the Jurkat cells at a concentration of 0.1 X 10° cells/ml ( 48 ) .
Plasmid construction The human IL-2 promotor-enhancer fragment ( -500 to +60 ) was sub-cloned from plasmid SV-IL-2-CAT into the luciferase vector pGL2 ( Promega ) ( 16 ) .
The AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the rat prolactin minimal promoter ( -36 to +37 ) under the control of four copies of the human AP-1 site ( 49 ) was kindly provided by M. Rincon and R. A. Flavell ( Section of Immunobiology , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT ) .
The IL-2 promotor mutated in the CD28RE region was generated by PCR-directed splicing overlap extension .
The PCR replaced 6 bp within the CD28RE ( from -159 to -164 ) in the IL-2 enhancer of the pGL-2-IL-2-Luc vector with the sequence 5 `` -CCTCGA-3 ' .
Plasmids containing multimers of the recognition sites for NF- « B and CD28RC were constructed and linked to the pLuc-prolactin minimal promoter plasmid ( 16 ) .
The orientation for each element was confirmed by restriction enzyme cleavage .
The tandem sequences used to construct the different multimers plasmids were as follows : 1 ) four copies of the CD28RE ( CD28RE of the human IL-2 promoter 5'-AAAGAAATTCC-3 ' ; 2 ) four copies of the AP-1 , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , - 5'-TCGATTGAGTCAGGGTAA 3 ' ; 3 ) two copies of the NF- « B-binding site of the human Ig « light chain enhancer 5 ) three copies of the CD28RE/AP-1 sequence of the IL-2 promoter ( -161 to -138 ) was cloned in three copies upstream of the minimal promoter from the CR version of the human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus-1 long terminal repeat , 3X CAGAAATTC 5375 CAAAGAG TCATCAGA ( 50 ) ; 6 ) three copies of the CD28RE/AP-1 construct bearing the mutation for the CD28RE ( CD28REm ) , TTTAAAGC CATTCCAAA ( 50 ) ; 7 ) three copies of the CD28RE/AP-1 construct bearing the mutation for the AP-1 ( AP-1 REm ) , CCAAAGAGAGATCA-GAA ( 50 ) ; 8 ) three copies of the CD28RE/AP-1 construct bearing a double mutation for the CD28RE ( CD28REm ) and AP-1 ( AP-1 m ) , 3X CA GAAATTCCAAAGAGAGA TCAGA ( 50 ) ; 9 ) IL-2 promoter construct bearing a mutation for the NF- « B site , AAAGAGGCTTTTCACCT ( 50 ) .
DNA transfection and luciferase activity analysis Transfection of Jurkat cells was conducted by electroporation , using an electro cell manipulator 600 ( BTX , San Diego , CA ) using 130 V/1700 uF capacitance .
Briefly , 8 X 10° cells were transfected with 10 pug of luciferase reporter plasmid and 5 pg of each expression plasmid , and the mixture was incubated for 24 h. Cells were stimulated with the different CHO-transfected cell lines with or without 100 ng of SEE per ml for another 8 h. Cells were harvested 32 h posttransfection , washed twice in PBS , and treated with lysis buffer ( luciferase assay , Promega ) for 5 to 10 min on ice .
Lysates were spun down for 1 min , and the total supernatants were analyzed using luciferase reagent ( Promega ) and measured as a duplicate in a luminometer ( MicroLumat LB 96 P , Berthold ) for 5 s. Background measurement was subtracted from each duplicate , and experimental values are expressed either as recorded light units of luciferase activity or as relative activity compared with extracts from unstimulated cells ( 16 ) .
IL-2 bioassay The amount of IL-2 in supernatants was determined in a microassay based on IL-2-dependent proliferation of the CTLL murine cell line as described ( 12 ) .
Results B7-1 costimulation of Jurkat T cells results in strong induction of AP-1 and NF- « B/Re !
l-driven reporter genes and high levels of IL-2 transcription , while LFA-3 costimulation results in low or moderate activity of AP-1 , NF-KB , and IL-2 promoter-driven reporter genes ( 16 ) .
To elucidate the role of AP-1 and Rel proteins in the superinduction of IL-2 transcription , we transiently overexpressed these nuclear factors in Jurkat T cells and studied their influence on the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter and multimers of the AP-1 , CD28 , and NF-KB response elements using reporter constructs .
The transfected Jurkat cells were costimulated with untransfected CHO cells , CHO-DR , CHO-DR/B7-1 , CHO-DR/ LFA-3 , and CHO-DR/B7-1/LFA-3 transfectants , in the presence and absence of the superantigen SEE .
In this system , the Jurkat T cells receive the first signal by the interaction between TCR and the SEE/HLA-DR complex and a second signal by the B7/CD28 or LFA-3/CD2 pathways .
B7-1 but not LFA-3 costimulation superinduces IL-2 production Large amounts of IL-2 were produced by B7-1-costimulated Jurkat T cells in the presence of SEE , while a five- to sixfold amount was observed after LFA-3 costimulation ( Fig .
1 ) .
Only marginal production was seen in SEE- and CHO-DR-stimulated T cells .
Production of IL-2 was further increased when Jurkat T cells were costimulated with the triple CHO transfectant ( CHO-DR/B7-1/ LFA-3 ) , indicating a cooperative effect between B7-1 and LFA-3 in IL-2 gene expression ( Fig .
1 ) .
c-Jun transfection partially enhances transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding c-Jun and c-Fos and reporter constructs containing the inducible region of the IL-2 enhancer/promoter ( -500 to +60 ) or an AP-1 reporter gene .
B7-1 costimulation was required to induce high transcription of these constructs .
The effect observed after LFA-3 costimulation was three- to fourfold lower on both IL-2 promoter and AP-l-driven transcription .

These results correlated with the induction of IL-2 protein production presented in Figure 1 .
Overexpression of c-Jun slightly enhanced the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .

Cotransfection of a c-Fos expression vector did not affect the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
24 ) and AP-1 ( Fig .

A substantial increase in IL-2 promoter and AP-1 transcriptional activity was observed after combined cotransfection of c-Jun and c-Fos .
Interestingly , AP-1-driven transcription in c-Fos/c-Jun-transfected Jurkat cells was dramatically augmented in DR and DR/LFA-3-stimulated T cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
Ap-parently , a proper signal is required to induce AP-1 reporter activity in Jun/Fos-transfected T cells , since no activity was seen in Jurkat cells stimulated with CHO/SEE alone .

The transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
3A ) , NF-KB ( Fig .
3B ) , and CD28RE reporter constructs was augmented by B7-1 and B7-1/LFA-3 costimulation , while the activity induced by LFA-3 was low ( Fig .

Marginal or no induction was observed after HLA-DR stimulation alone .
The luciferase activity expressed by the CD28RE-driven reporter construct ( Fig .
3C ) was low , compared with the luciferase activity expressed by the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
34 ) and NF-KB ( Fig .

Overexpression of p50 and c-Rel had marginal and low effects , respectively , on the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
34 ) and NF-KB ( Fig .

Cotransfection of p65 expression plasmids resulted in a moderate to strong increase in the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .

A dramatic effect of the p65 proteins on the frans-activation of the NF- « B reporter construct ( Fig .
3B ) in DR/LFA-3-costimulated T cells was ob-served , resulting in a similar activity as in B7-1-costimulated T cells .
More interestingly , a dramatic transcriptional increase was observed after cotransfection of CD28RE reporter construct and the p65 expression plasmid ( Fig .

However , the CD28RE activity in p65 expressing Jurkat cells remained at 2.5 to threefold lower levels when costimulated with LFA-3 compared with B7-1 .
c-Rel transfection increased only two- to threefold the CD28RE-dependent frams-activation , whereas p50 transfection failed to influence CD28RE transcription .
Combined transcription of c-Jun with p65 or c-Rel strongly up-regulates the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter To determine whether overexpression of AP-1 and Rel proteins cooperate to regulate the transcriptional activity of the inducible IL-2 promoter , we performed cotransfection assays with the IL-2 promoter reporter construct and p65 ( Fig .

In contrast , expression of c-Fos suppressed the potent frans-activation by p65 ( Fig .

Interestingly , LFA-3 costimulation of p65/c-Jun cotransfected cells induced > 20-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter , resulting in levels similar to that observed in B7-1-costimulated cells ( Fig .

Reporter constructs carrying multimers of CD28RE/AP-1 sites are synergistically stimulated by B7-1 and B7-1/LFA-3 Previous studies have suggested that the IL-2 promoter proxi-mal AP-1-binding site influences the activity of the CD28RE ( 35 , 50 , 51 ) .

tivity expressed by reporter construct containing the multimer of the CD28RE , we used luciferase reporter constructs containing a multimer of a linked CD28RE-AP-1 ( wild-type ) construct and a panel of substitution mutants , including CD28REmt-AP-1 ( CD28RE mutant ) , CD28RE-AP-1 mt ( AP-1 mutant ) , and CD28REmt-AP-1 mt ( CD28RE-AP-1 double mutant ) .
The pGL-2 vector was used as a negative control .
Jurkat T cells transfected with the CD28RE/AP-1 ( wild-type ) responded strongly to costimulation induced by B7-1 and B7-1/LFA-3 ( Fig .
5 ) .
Interestingly , mutations introduced into the CD28RE only marginally affected the activity induced by DR/LFA-3 but strongly reduced the response to B7-1 costimulation .
The AP-1 mutation reduced the response dramatically after B7-1 costimulation and moderately after LFA-3 costimulation ( Fig .
5 ) .
The luciferase activity expressed by either the CD28REmt or the AP-1 mt is grossly in the same range as the activity expressed by the reporter construct multimers of AP-1 or CD28RE sites alone in this system .
The linkage of the CD28RE/AP-1 site creates a strong transcriptional reporter gene activity in B7-1-costimulated Jurkat T cells and supports the hypothesis of cooperative effects between these cis-acting sites .

CD28RE/AP-1-driven transcription is enhanced by overexpression of p6S5/c-Jun To determine whether the combined action of p65 and c-Jun could cooperate to up-regulate the transcriptional activity of the CD28RE/AP-1 reporter construct , we transiently expressed in Jurkat T cells the CD28RE/AP-1 reporter construct with p65 , c-Fos , and c-Jun expression plasmids .
The luciferase activity in Jurkat T cells costimulated with DR , DR/B7-1 , DR/LFA-3 , and DR/B7-1/ LFA-3 was moderately increased by p65 and strongly increased by the combined action of p65/c-Jun ( Fig .
6 ) A functional CD28RE is required for p65/c-IJun-mediated superinduction of the IL-2 promoter To study whether the p65- and p65/c-Jun mediated superinduction of the IL-2 gene promoter involved the CD28RE , we performed cotransfection assays with wild-type IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
74 ) and CD28RE-mutated IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
7B ) luciferase reporter constructs together with expression vectors for p65 , c-Fos , c-Jun , and the combination of c-Fos/p65 and c-Jun/p65 .
The luciferase activity was strongly reduced in the IL-2 mutant ( Fig .
7B ) , and the coexpression of p65/c-Jun only marginally influenced this response and failed to restore the transcriptional activity .
These data demonstrated the requirement for a functional CD28RE to superinduce IL-2 transcription in p65/c-Jun-stimulated T cells .
This requirement was further demonstrated with an IL-2 promoter wild-type ( Fig .
84 ) and an IL-2 promoter bearing a mutation at the NF- « B binding site ( Fig .
8B ) .
The results demonstrated that the transcriptional activity in the mutated IL-2 promoter was diminished by 30 % , and it could not only be restored but also be superinduced by the combination of c-Jun/p65 .
Discussion B7-1 and LFA-3 provide costimulatory signals to T cells promoting T cells proliferation and cytokine production .
However , the profile of B7-1 and LFA-3 costimulated cells differ markedly .

B7-1 is a potent inducer of IL-2 production and sustained T cell growth , whereas LFA-3 induces low amounts of IL-2 and autocrine transient T cell proliferation .
However , high levels of IL-2 production in CD2-costimulated T cells has been demonstrated by other studies ( 5 , 11 , 52 ) .
The reasons for this discrepancy may reflect the use of nonphysiologic ligands , such as PMA , calcium ionophore or mAbs to induce the signals into the T cells .
Recently , we showed that B7-1 costimulation induced higher levels of AP-1-and Rel-dependent transcription compared with LFA-3 costimulation ( 16 ) .
However , the levels of NF-AT binding activity were higher after LFA-3 costimulation ( 16 ) .
We also demonstrated that CD2 and CD28 activation induced different patterns of NF-AT complexes and NF-AT-associated proteins ( 16 ) , indicating an additional signaling pathway following CD2 triggering .
The role of CD2 in the regulation of NF-AT has been demonstrated by Denger ( T. J. Denger , unpublished data ) .
He showed that anti-CD2 and anti-CD48 mAbs in combination with cyclosporin A act synergistically to induce immunosuppression and graft survival , suggesting a direct relationship between anti-CD2 mAbs and CsA in the inhibition of NF-AT .
In this work , we have demonstrated that the overexpression of c-Jun and p65 nuclear factors in Jurkat T cells superinduces IL-2 production in LFA-3-costimulated T cells .
Overexpression of c-Jun or p65 alone only moderately enhanced IL-2 promoter activity in LFA-3-costimulated cells , whereas coexpression of these proteins strongly augmented IL-2 activity in LFA-3-costimulated cells and induced transcriptional levels severalfold higher than the levels seen in B7-1-costimulated untransfected T cells .
Indeed , c-Jun/ p65-expressing T cells transcribed the IL-2 promoter during LFA-3 costimulation almost as efficiently as during B7-1 costimulation .
The ability of Fos/Jun and Rel proteins to cross-couple and potentiate transcription has been reported also in other systems ( 46 , 53 ) .
However , the combined action of p65/c-Jun was unable to substantially improve the low luciferase activity observed in an IL-2 promoter reporter construct containing a mutation in the CD28RE site but strongly induced the transcriptional activity of a NF- « B-mutated IL-2 promoter , suggesting a requirement for an 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; The Journal of Immunology L ] CHO CHO-DR C CHO-DR/B7-1 CHO-DR/LFA-3 EN CHO-DR/B7-1LFA-3 IL-2 P-wt-Lue Luciferase Activity ( RLU x 103 ) Vector ( s ) 80 B IL-2 P CD28RE mut Luciferase Activity ( RLU x 10° ) 65 yo* ye® ® B r * a 965 ] ) & @ 5 ‘ ° Vector ( s ) FIGURE 7 .

intact CD28RE for the effect of c-Jun/p65 complex in the up-reg-ulation of IL-2 promoter activity .
Our present data support a role for the CD28RE in integrating AP-1- and Rel-mediated transcriptional events which seems to be crucial in the transition from low ( autocrine ) to strong IL-2 ( paracrine ) transcription .
Recent studies have suggested that the CD28RE may work in conjunction with the IL-2 promoter-proximal AP-1 site ( 35 , 50 , 51 ) .
Our analysis using CD28RE/AP-1 mutant constructs demonstrates that both sites are required for optimal transcription and that the AP-1-prox-imal sequence cooperates with the NF-KB like CD28RE to increase the IL-2 transcriptional activity in B7-1-costimulated cells .
How do the p65 and c-Jun proteins cooperate ?
One possibility is that c-Jun itself or in conjunction with a cofactor protein binds to the AP-1 site flanking the CD28RE and stabilizes the binding of p65 .
A role for AP-1 proteins in stabilizing Rel-like proteins in the IL-2 promoter is supported by the fact that AP-1 participation in the NE-AT complex confers increased DNA binding stability of NF-ATp ( 46 ) .
Moreover , a physical interaction between members of the bZip protein family of transcription factors which includes AP-1 , CREB , ATF , and SRF , and Rel family proteins has been reported in several other promoters ( 53 ) .

have indicated that CD28RE has a low affinity for p65 ( 16 ) but displays a more prominent binding to c-Rel ( 16 ) .
Our data further suggest that the different members of the Fos/Jun and Rel families may affect the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter in a distinct manner ( 16 ) .
Whereas coexpression of c-Rel and c-jun only moderately enhanced the luciferase activity in LFA-3 costimulated cells , coexpression of p65 and c-jun superinduced the transcriptional activity of IL-2 promoter .
The p50 subunit was unable to increase the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter or NF- « B or CD28REs , suggesting that the p50 subunit contains a weak frans-activation domain or that it may bind to suppressive factors .
In contrast to p50 , c-Rel and p65 contain strong frans-activating domains ( 21 , 22 ) .
The p65 frans-activating subunit of NF- « B has been extensively characterized ( 17 , 54 ) , but little is known about its interaction with other nuclear factors .
Recently , it has been demonstrated that the binding of the high mobility group I ( Y ) proteins to the CD28RE within the IL-2 strongly potentiated the binding activity of c-Rel ( 55 ) , while the binding of Rel-A was not increased .
This suggests that the involvement of cofactors can modulate the activity of various Rel proteins in a distinct manner .
It remains to be delineated whether high mobility group-like proteins that interact preferentially with p65 are present in c-Jun/p65-transfected Jurkat cells .
6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; 5380 p65 AND c-Jun OVEREXPRESSION SUPERINDUCE IL-2 PROMOTER ACTIVITY It is interesting that no increase in IL-2 promoter or CD28RE/ AP-1 activity can be detected in c-Rel-transfected Jurkat T cells because of a large amount of evidence that this protein is important to the expression of this gene .
Several laboratories have now reported c-rel-specific binding to the CD28RE ( 16 , 35 , 51 , 55 ) and c-Rel , but not p65 , can be found in a CD28RE/AP-1 specific complex also containing c-Fos/c-Jun ( 35 ) .
In conjunction with the decrease in IL-2 production observed in c-Rel-deficient mice , these data strongly suggest that c-Rel is important to IL-2 promoter activity in vivo .
However , recent studies have also suggested that c-Rel levels in the nucleus are high under conditions where IL-2 promoter activity is low ( 35 ) , strongly suggesting that c-Rel is not a limiting factor in IL-2 production but that some other mechanisms limit the activity of this promoter in suboptimal stimulation conditions .
This could explain the inability of c-Rel to efficiently trans-activate the IL-2 promoter in transfected Jurkat T cells despite playing a role in the expression of this gene in vivo .
The relevance of the interaction between members of the « B/Re !
l family and AP-1 transcription factors families for regulation of gene expression has been demonstrated in a previous study showing that c-Fos and c-Jun act synergistically with NF-KB to trans-activate a xB enhancer element or an AP-1 site ( 53 ) .
In addition we found that the synergistic effect on the NF- « B-like CD28RE was restricted to c-Jun and p65 .
In contrast , overexpression of c-Fos suppressed the potent frans-activation of the IL-2 promoter by p65 .
Positive and negative effects of c-fos have been reported previously ( 56-59 ) .
Accordingly , it is tempting to propose that the c-fos suppresses the strong transcriptional activity of p65 .
Whether this involves a direct protein-protein interaction between p65 and c-Fos that decreases the transcriptional activity of p65 , sequestering of c-Jun from p65 by formation of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers or other indirect effects remains to be determined .
The activity of a c-Rel/ c-Jun combination was not reduced by c-Fos expression , suggesting that the negative effect of c-Fos is selective for the p65 Rel family protein .
Thus , both c-Jun and c-Fos are able to affect p65 activity causing a dynamic modulation of p65-mediated transcription of the CD28RE .
T cells transfected with c-Jun/c-Fos expressed high levels of an AP-1 reporter gene activity when stimulated with DR/superantigen but failed to respond to CHO + SEE .
This indicates that signal 1 is required and sufficient for posttran-scriptional activation of c-Jun/c-Fos proteins when these are expressed in high levels .
Thus , the failure of signal 1 to drive the AP-1 reporter in untransfected cells may relate to the low expression of these gene products .
The fact that B7-1 costimulation superinduced AP-1 activity in c-Jun/c-Fos-overexpressing cells may reflect that CD28/B7-1 interaction augment the JNK protein required for translational activation of c-Jun ( 60 ) , which may be a rate-limiting step in c-Jun/ c-Fos-overexpressing cells .
Indeed , our preliminary data demonstrate profound induction of JNK activity in B7-1- but not LFA-3-costimulated Jurkat T cells ( data not shown ) .
p65-transfected Jurkat T cells expressing a NF-KB reporter responded only moderately to signal 1 induction .
B7-1 or LFA-3 was required for strong transcription in these cells .
Whether this reflects insufficient degradation of IB protein is presently under evaluation .
LFA-3 and B7-1 costimulation of p6S-expressing Jurkat cells induced similar levels of NF-KB , while the response of a CD28RE reporter was severalfold higher in B7-1 cells .
Possibly , this may reflect a more efficient activation of endogenous AP-1 protein in B7-1-costimulated T cells .
In conclusion , our data suggest that the molecular base for transition from a LFA-3-dependent autocrine response to a B7-1 paracrine response involves induction of p65/c-Jun and targeting of the CD28RE within the IL-2 promoter .
