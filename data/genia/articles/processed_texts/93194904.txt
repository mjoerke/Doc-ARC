Cell Type- and Stage-specific Expression of the CD20/B1 Antigen Correlates with the Activity of a Diverged Octamer DNA Motif Present in Its Promoter* ( Received for publication , September 3 , 1992 ) Claire Thévenin , Brian P. Lucas , Eric J. Kozlow , and John H. Kehrl¢t From the Laboratory of Immunoregulation , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 The CD20 ( B1 ) gene encodes a B cell-specific protein involved in the regulation of human B cell proliferation and differentiation .
Studies with 5 deletion CD20 promoter-CAT constructs have previously revealed two regions of the promoter between bases -186 and -280 and between bases -280 and -454 which contained positive regulatory elements .
In this study we identified a sequence element present in the most proximal region located between bases -214 and -201 , TTCTTCTAATTAA , which is important in the high constitutive expression of CD20 in mature B cells and the induction of CD20 in pre-B cells .
This sequence element was referred to as the BAT box and its deletion significantly reduced the activity of a CD20 promoter-CAT construct in B cells .
Mobility shift assays with various mutant probes and B cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that the core sequence TAAT was essential for binding to this site .
Cross competition experiments with an octamer sequence from the Ig heavy chain promoter , the BAT box , and a TA-rich sequence present in the CD21 promoter revealed that all three sequences bound the same nuclear proteins suggesting that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
Southwestern blotting and UV cross-linking studies confirmed that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
The affinity of the BAT box binding proteins for the BAT box was approximately 25-fold less than for the octamer sequence and the BAT box binding proteins dissociated from the BAT box 10-fold more rapidly than from the octamer sequence .
Despite this lower affinity , a trimer of the BAT box sequence was as efficiently transactivated by an Oct-2 expression vector as was a trimer of the octamer sequence in HeLa cells .
The BAT box and Oct-2 were also implicated in the induction of CD20 in the pre-B cell line , PB-697 , via phorbol esters .
The induction of CD20 mRNA was temporally associated with induction of Oct-2 mRNA and a BAT box-deleted CD20-CAT con-struct , in contrast to the wild type , was poorly induced by phorbol esters .
Together these results suggest that the BAT box binding proteins are important in the B cell specific expression of CD20 and perhaps CD21 .

Two of the earliest cell surface markers expressed on hematopoietic cells committed to the B cell lineage are CD19 and CD10 .
As these cells mature they acquire other B cell antigens , including CD20 and CD21 ( 1 , 2 ) .
In order to express surface immunoglobulin ( Ig ) B cell precursors first rearrange their Ig heavy chain loci and synthesize cytoplasmic u heavy chains .
Subsequently , they rearrange their « or \ Ig genes , synthesize light chains , and express surface IgM .
Mature B cells which are surface Ig-positive , CD19 , and CD20-positive migrate from the fetal liver or bone marrow to the peripheral lymphoid organs where they may be activated by antigen and in the presence of helper cells and factors progress to Ig secretion ( 3 , 4 ) .
The differential expression of these various B cell surface antigens is thought to be predominantly regulated by alteration in the rates of gene transcription .
Cis-elements important in the promoters and enhancers of several B lymphocyte genes have been identified including the Ig heavy and light chain genes , the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes , and more recently the mb-1 gene .
One cis-element present in the promoters of the Ig genes as well as the DR- « gene and the B29 gene is an octanucleotide sequence ( ATTTGCAT ) located approximately 70 bp ' upstream of the transcription start site .
In addition , several of the Ig enhancers possess the same sequence element ( 5-10 ) .
Two proteins present in B cell nuclear extracts have been found to specifically recognize this octamer motif , Oct-1 , which is expressed ubiquitously , and Oct-2 , whose expression is largely restricted to B cells ( 11-13 ) .
Based on in vitro studies , Oct-2 is likely to be important in the B cell-specific expression of these genes .
One of the cell surface antigens restricted to B cells is CD20 .
CD20 is present on both resting B cells and activated B cells but is lost prior to the terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells .
cDNAs have been isolated for CD20 and the genomic structure of the CD20 gene determined ( 14-18 ) .
In contrast to the Ig genes , the promoter region of the CD20 gene does not contain a consensus octamer binding site nor does it contain consensus sites for other known DNA binding proteins or a TATA box .
Initial analysis of the promoter region by transfection experiments with CD20 promoter-CAT constructs , and via mobility shift assays to characterize DNA binding proteins , identified a major cis-acting element between -225 and -201 which interacted with a nuclear protein which was restricted to B lymphocytes .
This element also appeared to be important in the induction of CD20 in a pre-B cell line PB-697 ( 19 ) .
PB-697 cells are CD20 ' The abbreviations used are : bp , base pair ( s ) ; CAT , chloramphen-icol acetyltransferase ; PMA , phorbol myristate acetate ; PAGE , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
5949 5950 negative but can be induced to express CD20 following treatment with phorbol esters .
In this study , we have further delineated the binding site for this DNA binding protein , analyzed its importance in the expression of the CD20 promoter , and present evidence that this site is a diverged binding site for Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture and Reagents-BJA.B cells ( Epstein-Barr virus-neg-ative lymphoma ) were kindly provided by Dr. E. Oates ( University of Miami , Miami , FL ) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 +10 % plus fetal calf serum .
The pre-B cell line PB-697 was obtained from Dr. T. Tedder ( Dana Farber Institute , Boston , MA ) , and the cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 15 % fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) ( Sigma ) .
Analysis of fluorescently stained cells was performed on a Epics profile analyzer ( Coulter Electronics , Hialeah , FL ) using B1 or B2 antibodies ( Coulter Immunology , Hialeah , Fl ) for CD20 and CD21 , respectively .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays-BJA.B cells nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al .
( 20 ) .
Oligonucleotides containing the TA-rich sequence from the CD20 promoter from -214 to -200 , mutants of the same sequence , the TA-rich sequence present in the CD21 promoter between bp -653 and bp -623 ( 21 ) , or a consensus octamer sequence and their complementary strands were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA synthesizer ( Foster City , CA ) .
Probes for mobility shift assays were labeled by filling in 5 ' overhangs in the presence of [ « - `` P ] dCTP , [ y- `` P ] dGTP , [ y-*°P ] dATP , [ y-*P ] TTP .
10 ug of proteins were incubated for 20 min with 0.5 ng ( 10° cpm ) of P-labeled probe in the presence of 17 ul of binding buffer ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) and 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) .
Samples were electrophoresed on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel in a low ionic strength ( 3.3 mM sodium acetate , 6.7 mM Tris/HCl , pH = 7.5 , 1 mM EDTA , pH = 7.5 ) or high ionic strength ( 50 mM Tris base , 380 mM glycine , 2 mM EDTA ) running buffer .
For competitive binding experiments , increasing amount of unlabeled oligonucleotides ( 5-2000-fold molar excess ) were incubated in the binding reaction .
For measurement of DNA protein complex stability , the DNA and proteins were incubated for 20 min and then treated with a 250-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe prior to electrophoresis .
Free probe and bound protein were located by autoradiography , excised , and quantitated by scintillation counting .
Results are presented as the fraction of probe bound normalized to 1.0 at time 0 .
Southwestern Blot-Affinity purification of BAT -box binding proteins was performed as described by Ostrowski et al .
( 22 ) .
BAT box-specific binding proteins were affinity purified using sequence-specific double-stranded oligonucleotides coupled to agarose beads ( 23 ) .
To couple specific oligonucleotides to agarose beads , trimers of either the CD20 BAT box or a probe containing a mutation on the TAAT core sequence were synthesized and amino-modified at their 5 end using N-MMT-C12 Aminomodifier ( Clontech Laboratories , Palo Alto , CA ) .
The 5'-amino-modified oligonucleotides were biotinylated , annealed , and coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads .
Nuclear extracts from BJA.B cells ( 200 ug of protein ) were incubated with mutant DNA-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer ( 25 mM Hepes , pH = 7.9 , 25 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl , , 0.5 mm dithiothreitol ) .
The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant re-incubated with sequence-specific DNA-agarose beads in binding buffer for 1 h at 4°C .
The suspension was then centrifuged , the supernatant discarded , and the beads were washed three times with binding buffer .
Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling in equal volume of SDS sample buffer ( Enprotech , Hyde Park , MD ) , separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) , and electro-blotted to an Immobilon-P membrane ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) at 50 V for 4 h , in transfer buffer ( 25 mm Tris/HCl , pH = 8.2 , 192 mm glycine , 20 % methanol , 0.005 % SDS ) .
Proteins were denatured by incubating the membrane in denaturing buffer ( 7 M guanidine HCJ , 50 mM Tris , 2.0 mM dithiothreitol , 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin , pH = 7.4 ) for 30 min at room temperature and allowed to renature in renaturing solution ( 50 mM Tris/HCl , 150 mm NaCl , 2 mM dithiothreitol , 2 mM EDTA , 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin , pH = 7.4 ) for 24 h at 4 °C .
Following renaturation , the filters were blocked for 2 h at 4 °C in Blotto ( binding buffer + 5 % dry milk ) , washed for 5 min in binding buffer + 0.25 % dry milk at room temperature , and hybridized with a P-labeled trimer of the octamer at 10° cpm/ml in binding buffer supplemented with 0.25 % dry milk and 10 ug/ml Analysis of the Human CD20 Promoter salmon sperm DNA for 60 min at room temperature .
The filters were washed three times for 5 min each in binding buffer at room temperature and autoradiographed .
UV Cross-linking-Gel shift assays were performed as described above using 30 ug of BJA.B nuclear extracts and a 27-bp probe substituted with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine .
2 ng of end-labeled DNA were incubated with nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature and protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel .
Following electrophoretic separation , protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked in situ by 20-min exposure of the gel to UV light on a transilluminator .
The specific DNA-proteins complexes were visualized by autoradiography , excised from the gel , eluted from acrylamide using Elutrap chambers in 25 mM Tris base , 2 mM glycine , 0.1 % SDS , precipitated with 4 volumes of acetone for 2 h at -20 °C , washed with methanol , analyzed by 10 % SDS-PAGE , and visualized by autoradiography .
DNA Constructs and Transfection-Double-stranded DNA corresponding to trimers of the octamer sequence ( 5 CGCTTCTTA ATTTGCATACCCTCG 3 ' ) , the CD20 promoter sequence from -220 to -201 ( 5 CAGAAGTTCTTCTAATTAAG 3 ' ) , and a single copy of the CD21 TA-rich sequence ( 5 TAATAATTATATAATTA TAATTATATAATC 3 ' ) were subcloned into a Sall site of a c-fos promoter containing CAT plasmid A71 ( kindly provided by Dr. M. Lenardo , Laboratory of Immunology , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) ) .
The orientation of each DNA construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing .
The plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells by a calcium phosphate method as described ( 24 ) .
48 h after transfection the cells were harvested and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing .
The protein concentrations were normalized using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay ( Bio-Rad ) , and CAT activity was measured using a scintillation assay as described previously ( 25 ) .
A CMV-CAT plasmid ( kindly provided by Dr. A. Dayton , Laboratory of Immunoregulation , NIAID , NIH ) was used as a control for transfection .
Results are given as mean percentage of CAT conversion from at least three independent transfections .
Construction of the Mutant Plasmid CD20 ABAT-CAT-The BAT box region of one of the CD20-CAT plasmid was deleted .
This mutant plasmid was constructed by subjecting the wild type plasmid CD20-4s , -CAT ( 18 ) to the polymerase chain reaction with the forward primer and a reverse primer complementary to the CD20 promoter from -182 to -217 ( 5 ' CCTGGCATGCTCATGCTACCAGAACTT 3 ' ) with the exception of a 9-bp deletion in the BAT box .
The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with SphI and ligated into SphI-digested CD20-44-CAT constructs .
The deletion of the BAT box was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the mutant plasmid .
The mutant and wild type plasmids CD20-,45 , -CAT were transfected in HS.Sultan and PB-697 cells using DEAE-dextran .
PB-697 cells were stimulated with PMA 24 h after transfection .
After 48 h the cells were harvested , and CAT activity was determined as described above .
Northern Blot Analysis-RNA was isolated from PB-697 cells grown in media lacking or containing PMA for 0 , 6 , 12 , or 24 h. 15 ug of RNA was size-fractionated by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde 1 % agarose gel , transferred to nitrocellulose , baked at 80°C , and hybridized for 18 h at 65 °C using conditions described previously ( 26 ) .
The specific activity of the Oct-2 and actin probes was approximately 5 X 10° cpm/ug , and 10° cpm/ml was used for hybridization .
Prehybridization , hybridization and wash condition were performed as described ( 26 ) .
RESULTS Determination of the Core Sequence of the BAT Box by Mutational Analysis-A previous study characterized a region of the CD20 promoter between -225 and -201 as a binding site for a transcription factor ( 18 ) .
In order to more precisely map this binding site , oligonucleotides derived from the region -225/-201 or containing mutations in this region were synthesized and tested for binding activity by mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from BJA.B cells ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
Mutation of the centrally located TAAT ( Fig .
1B , lane 3 ) completely abolished binding , whereas mutation of the flanking sequences surrounding the core sequence ( Fig .
1B , lanes 2 and 4 ) partially inhibited binding .
The M4 mutant ( Fig .

Mapping of the BAT box by mutational analysis .
A , sequence of the oligonucleotides from the CD20 BAT box wild type and mutant probes ( WT , MI , M2 , M3 , M4 ) derived from the BAT box region of CD20 promoter .
B , mobility shift assay of the wild type and mutant probes .
All lanes contained 0.5 ng of oligonucleotides containing either wild type or mutant sequences described in A which have been incubated with 10 ug of BJA.B nuclear extracts .
The mobility shift assays were run under high ionic conditions .

complex .
These results map the binding region to a 14-base pair AT -rich sequence TTCTTCTAATTAAG in which the central TAAT is the core sequence of the binding site .
This sequence was defined as the CD20 BAT box .
Only one complex obtained with nuclear extract from B cells was retarded when high ionic strength running buffer ( Fig .
1 ) was used .
By changing the buffer conditions to low ionic strength ( Fig .
2 ) , a second complex of slower mobility was detectable .
This upper complex was found in nuclear extracts from various cell lines , including Jurkat , U937 , HeLa , PB-697 , HS-Sultan , and BJA.B , whereas the lower complex was present only in the mature B cell nuclear extracts ( data not shown ) .
The same core sequence was found to be essential for the binding of the lower complex and for the binding of the upper complex when the experiment was performed using low ionic conditions .
The CD20 BAT Box and the CD21 TA-rich Sequence Bind the Same Proteins as the Octamer Sequence-Search of the promoter and enhancer regions of known B cell-specific genes failed to find any matches to the BAT box .
However , several B cell-specific promoters and enhancers did contains elements homologous to the TA-rich portion of the BAT box , including the octamer sequence and a TA-rich sequence present in the CD21 promoter ( -623 to -653 upstream of the major tran-scriptional start site ) .
A comparison of the sequences is shown in Fig .
24 .
Oligonucleotides corresponding to these sequences were used as probes in cross-competition experiments using mobility shift assays with BJA.B nuclear extracts ( Fig .
2B ) .
These experiments suggested that the TA-rich sequence pres 5951 OCTAMER : ATGCAAATNA Lo O BAT-B : CT TCTAAT TAA oe CD21-TA : - AT TATAAT TAT Probe Octamer BAT-B Octamer CD21-TA Competitor | Oct BAT `` Oct BAT [ 0 Oct CD21 IﬁOm CD21 ' Fold Excess - £0 20050 200 - 50 20050 200 - 50 20050 200 - 50 20050 200 Oct 1-Oct 2 T b Wh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 101112131415 16 17 18 19 20 Fig .

Gel shift competition analysis of B cell nuclear factors binding to the BAT box with an octamer probe and a TA-rich sequence present in the CD21 promoter .
A , comparison of the TA-rich sequences present in the CD20 and the CD21 promoter with the octamer consensus sequence .
B , competition for binding to the TA-rich sequences from the CD20 or the CD21 promoter was tested with an oligonucleotide containing the consensus octamer sequence .
10 ug of BJA.B nuclear extracts were incubated with the octamer probe ( lanes 1-5 and 11-15 ) , the CD20 BAT box ( lanes 6-10 ) , or the CD21 TA-rich sequence ( lanes 16-20 ) in the presence of unlabeled octamer probe ( lanes 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 12 , 13 , 17 , and 18 ) , CD20 BAT box ( lanes 4 , 5 , 9 , and 10 ) , or CD21 TA-rich sequence ( lanes 14 , 15 , 19 , and 20 ) for 20 min before migration on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel under low ionic strength .
The complexes cores-sponding to the octamer binding proteins are labeled Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
ent in the CD21 promoter , the octamer sequence , and the BAT box all bound the same proteins .
A 50-fold excess of unlabeled octamer , a 200-fold excess of either unlabeled BAT box , or the CD21 TA-rich region competed for the binding with either the labeled BAT box probe ( lanes 6-10 ) or the labeled CD21 TA-rich region probe ( lanes 16-20 ) .
Neither the BAT box or the TA-rich CD21 region effectively competed the binding when a labeled octamer probe was used ( Fig .
2B , lanes 5 , 6 , 15 , and 16 ) .
These results suggested that the TA-rich regions present in the CD20 and in the CD21 promoter are bound by the octamer binding transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 but with a lower affinity than the octamer itself .
To confirm that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2 , nuclear extracts from BJA.B cells were characterized either by UV cross-linking ( Fig .
3 , lane 2 ) or by affinity purification on agarose beads coupled to BAT box DNA ( Fig .

Southwestern blot and UV cross-linking of DNA binding proteins to the BAT box .
A 20-bp photoreactive probe was incubated with 10 ug of nuclear extracts from BJA.B cells and separated by mobility shift assay .
DNA-protein complexes were irradiated in situ with UV light and the specific complexes excised , eluted , and resolved by SDS/10 % PAGE under reducing conditions ( lane 2 ) .
Southwestern blotting was performed by purifying 100 ug of nuclear extracts on agarose beads coupled to an oligonucleotide containing a BAT box binding site and subjected to a denaturing 10 % polyacrylamide gel , transferred to Immobilon-P membrane , and hybridized with a P-labeled oligonucleotide containing a trimer of an octamer probe ( lane 3 ) .
The large band in lane 3 contains Oct-1 as well as a nonspecific DNA binding protein .
3 , lane 3 ) .
The UV -cross-linked or affinity-purified proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE .
The UV-cross-linked proteins were directly autoradiographed , whereas the affinity-purified proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters .
Following denaturation and renaturation , the filters were hybridized with a *°P -labeled trimer of the octamer sequence .
The Southwestern blot identified two proteins of 91 and 56 kDa , similar to the known molecular masses of Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
The same pattern was observed when instead of a labeled octamer probe a trimer of the BAT box was used as a probe ( data not shown ) .
The molecular masses determined by the UV cross-linking experiments includes the molecular mass of the DNA probe , resulting in slightly higher molecular mass .
Based on the Southwestern blot and UV cross-linking experiments , the competition experiments , and the mobility shift assays showing that the upper complex was present in all cell lines tested while the lower complex was B cell-specific , strongly suggested that the two BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
The BAT Box Binds Oct-2 with a Lower Affinity Than the Octamer Sequence-Since a 200-fold excess of unlabeled BAT box probe was unable to effectively compete the binding of Oct-1 or Oct-2 to a labeled octamer probe , we determined the binding constants of Oct-1 and Oct-2 for the BAT box and the octamer by a gel retardation-competition assays and dissociation rate measurement .
Nuclear proteins extracted from BJA.B cells were incubated with a labeled probe containing the BAT box from the CD20 promoter region or with a probe Analysis of the Human CD20 Promoter containing the octamer site from the x light chain promoter .
Increasing amounts of unlabeled DNA containing either the BAT box or the octamer sequence were used as competitors .
The shifted bands were visualized by autoradiography , excised , and the amount of label quantitated by scintillation counting ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
We observed no difference between Oct-1 and Oct-2 in the affinity for the octamer probe in agreement with previous studies ( 27 ) .
The affinity of Oct-2 for the octamer probe was approximately 25 fold higher than for the BAT box ( as determined by Scatchard analysis of the binding data ( data not shown ) ) .
We next determined the dissociation rate of the octamer binding proteins for either the octamer probe or the BAT box probe .
Nuclear extracts from BJA.B cells were incubated with either *°P -labeled octamer or the BAT box probe for 20 min .
Subsequently , a 250-fold excess of unlabeled probe was added to the binding reaction for varying durations prior to loading on an acrylamide gel ( Fig .
5 ) .
Consistent with the results of the binding experiments , we observed that the Oct-2 protein dissociated much faster from the BAT box than from the octamer probe ( 50 % of the protein dissociated in 3 s from the BAT box and in 30 s from the octamer ) .
A Trimer of the BAT Box Linked to a Minimal Promoter Is Constitutively Active in HeLa Cells and Efficiently Transactivated by an Oct-2 Expression Vector-We next investigated the functional activity of the CD20 BAT box and CD21 TA-rich sequence and compared their activities with that of the octamer sequence .
Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either a trimer of the octamer , a trimer of the CD20 BAT box , or a single copy of the CD21 TA-rich sequence were subcloned into the SalI site of A71 CAT , and the resulting plasmids designated OCT x 3-CAT , BAT x 3-CAT , and CD21 TA-CAT , respectively , were transfected into HeLa cells in the presence or absence of an Oct-2 expression vector pCG-Oct-2 ( Fig .
6 ) .
Each of the three reporter plasmids , OCT x 3-CAT , BAT x 3-CAT , and CD21 TA-CAT , were constitutively active in HeLa cells , and each was transactivated by the Oct-2 expression vector ( 2.7- , 7.6- , and 5.2-fold , respectively ) .
The constitutive activity of the promoter constructs is undoubtedly secondary to the Oct-1 constitutively present in HeLa cells .
Thus , despite the low affinity of Oct-1 and Oct-2 for the BAT box and the CD21 TA-rich sequence binding sites , Oct-2 and presumably Oct-1 efficiently transactivates these constructs .
Two of the CD20 promoter-CAT constructs were transfected into HeLa cells in the presence or absence of the Oct-2 expression vector ( Fig .
6 , lanes 1-4 ) .
Oct-2 did not transactivate the BAT box in the context of the CD20 promoter in HeLa cells , suggesting that other transactivating factors not present in HeLa cells are important in transactivation of the CD20 promoter .
HS-Sultan cells were also transfected with BAT x 3-CAT construct in the presence or in the absence of an Oct-2 expression vector .
The BAT x 3-CAT construct was constitutively very active in the B cells , presumably due to the constitutive expression of Oct-1 and Oct-2 protein .
Co-trans-fection of an Oct-2 expression did result in a small , but reproducible , increase in reporter CAT activity ( 30-50 % compared with BAT x 3-CAT alone ) .
Deletion of the BAT Box in the CD20 Promoter Suppresses Its Activity in B Cells and a PMA -activated Pre-B Cell Line-To investigate the importance of the BAT box in the CD20 promoter , the BAT box region was deleted from the CD20-454-CAT construct .
The wild type and mutant plasmids were transfected into HS.Sultan and in PB-697 cells using DEAE-dextran transfection ( Fig .
7 ) .
24 h after transfection , the PB-697 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of PMA .

The mobility shift assays were performed under low ionic strength buffer .
The bands corresponding to Oct-1 and Oct-2 complexes were then excised and quantified by scintillation counting .

Dissociation rate of Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins for the octamer and the CD20 BAT box probes .
A P-labeled oligonucleotide containing either an octamer consensus sequence or the BAT box sequence were incubated with nuclear extracts from BJA.B cells , and after a 20-min incubation the DNA protein complex was competed by a 250-fold excess of unlabeled octamer or BAT -box probe .
After electrophoresis , the specific complexes were visualized , excised , and quantified by scintillation counting .
Results are presented as fraction of probe bound normalized to 1.0 at time t = 0. have shown that the CD20-negative human pre-B cell line PB-697 was inducible for CD20 surface antigen following treatment with phorbol esters ( 19 ) .
As described previously ( 18 ) , the CD20-,4 ; 4-CAT plasmid is constitutively active in HS.Sultan cells and is induced by PMA in PB-697 cells .
In contrast , the deletion of the BAT box in the promoter construct reduced its activity in B cells by 50 % and suppressed its inducibility in PB-697 , suggesting a functional role for this site in CD20 gene transcription .
Regulation of CD20 and CD21 and Oct-2 in PB-697 Pre-B Cells following Treatment of the Cells by PMA-To investigate the mechanism of CD20 induction in PB-697 , PB-697 cells were treated with PMA for 15 h , and CD20 and CD21 surface antigen expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence using a B1 or a B2 antibody ( Fig .
84 ) .
PMA treatment of the PB-697 cells for 24 h induced CD20/B1 surface antigen expression ; however , CD21 was not induced .
CD20 , CD21 , and Oct-2 RNA levels in PMA-treated PB-697 cells were examined by Northern blot analysis ( Fig .
8B ) .
RNAs from untreated PB-697 had undetectable levels of Oct-2 , CD20 , or CD21 .
After 12 h of treatment , CD20 mRNA was induced in PB-697 , reaching a maximum at 24 h , whereas CD21 mRNA was not detected .
Northern blot analysis of RNA for Oct-2 expression revealed induction of an approximately 6-kilobase Oct-2 mRNA .
The smaller Oct-2 transcripts normally found in mature B cells ( 3.6 , 3.3 , and 2 kilobase ) were poorly induced .
Oct-1 , but not Oct-2 , was detected by mobility shift assay of uninduced PB-697 cells ; however , following PMA treatment Oct-2 protein was detected within 6 h and peaked at 24 h ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the induction of CD20 in PB-697 was associated with an induction of Oct-2 mRNA and protein .
DISCUSSION Similar to the Ig genes , the CD20 gene is expressed at high levels in B cells .
CD20 mRNA transcripts are first detected in the early stages of the B cell lineage , and they persist until B cells differentiate into plasma cells .
The temporal expression of CD20 during B cell maturation and differentiation coincides with the expression of the B cell-specific octamer binding protein Oct-2 .
Although analysis of the CD20 promoter had previously mapped two major positive regulatory elements within bp -280/-186 and -454/-280 from the transcription start sites , no consensus octamer binding sites were identified in these regions ( 18 ) .
This study further analyzed the -280/-186 region of the CD20 promoter .
A major cis-acting element was found which bound a B cell-specific DNA binding protein .
By mutational analysis combined with mobility shift assays , a 14-base pair nucleotide sequence , TTCTTCTAATTAAG , was identified in which the core TAAT was essential for protein binding .
This region was defined as the BAT box .
Despite the lack of similarity of the BAT box to the standard octamer nucleotide sequence , several lines of evidence suggest that the BAT box binding proteins are Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
First , cross-competition studies with a BAT box probe and an octamer probe demonstrated that the binding of the BAT box binding proteins to the BAT box was readily competed with an octamer probe .
Second , affinity purification of the BAT box binding protein followed by Southwestern blotting with a labeled octamer probe identified two proteins with molecular mass similar to Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
Finally , UV cross-linking using a BAT box probe followed by SDS-PAGE identified two proteins which migrated with molecular mass consistent with Oct-1 and Oct-2 coupled to the BAT box .
Based on this evidence , the BAT box binding proteins are likely to be Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
Comparison of the BAT box sequence to promoter or enhancer sequences of known B cell-specific genes resulted in 5954 Analysis of the Human CD20 Promoter 100 |- g o |p I 50 |- % % e / e 200 A Yo Eo | A # f ® & 3 ¢ % m- =-Ob og Wok l- - & n # NA o # Foldpﬁlghggéi - 0 * ~ 0 * —7.6+ “ 52+ _2.7+ Fig .

Transactivation of trimers of the octamer , the CD20 BAT box , and the CD21 TA-rich sequence in HeLa cells by Oct-2 protein .
Oligonucleotides containing trimers of the BAT-box , the octamer , or a single copy of the TA-rich region of the CD21 promoter were subcloned in the Sall site of the c-fos promoter-containing plasmid A71 .
The plasmids as well as two CD20 promoter constructs ( CD20-s , -CAT and CD20- ; -CAT ) were used to transfect HeLa cells with or without an Oct-2 expression vector .

Mobility shift assays demonstrated that probes derived from this region bound similar proteins as the BAT box and the octamer sequence .
The requirement of high concentrations of the BAT box and the CD21 TA-rich sequence to compete the binding of Oct-2 to the octamer sequence suggested that the affinity of Oct-1 and Oct-2 for the BAT box and the CD21 TA-rich sequence was much less than that for the octamer .

Analysis of the binding data demonstrated that the octamer has an affinity for Oct-2 approximately 25-fold higher than the BAT box .
The lower affinity of the BAT box and the CD21 TA-rich sequence for Oct-2 raised questions on whether these sites were transactivated via Oct-2 in vivo .
To test whether the BAT box is functional in vivo , a trimer of the BAT box , the CD21 TA-rich sequence , and a trimer of the octamer were each linked to the CAT gene and used to transfect HeLa cells .

Regulation of CD20 , CD21 , and Oct-2 in PB-697 cells by PMA treatment .
A , induction of CD20 antigen in PB-697 cells treated with PMA .
PB-697 cells were treated with PMA ( 10 ng/ ml ) for 15 h , and cells were stained for the presence of surface CD20 and CD21 with B1 and B2 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies .
Cells were analyzed on an Epics profile analyzer and results given as relative fluorescence intensity .
B , Northern blot analysis of CD20 , CD21 , and Oct-2 mRNA transcripts in PB-697 after treatment with PMA .
RNAs from untreated PB-697 , or PB-697 treated with PMA for 6 , 12 , or 24 h , were analyzed by Northern blot analysis using a cDNA for CD20 , CD21 , Oct-2 , or actin .
The same filter was hybridized with an Oct-2 probe and then stripped and rehybridized with an actin probe .
The autoradiographs were exposed 4 h for the actin probe , overnight for CD20 and CD21 , and 4 days for Oct-2 .
presumably due to the presence of Oct-1 ; however , the BAT box and CD21 TA constructs were transactivated when Oct-2 was co-transfected .
Furthermore the BAT box trimer was much more active in B cells than in Jurkat T cells which lack Oct-2 unless stimulated .
However , the CD20 promoter has only a single BAT box which is displaced from the transcription start sites , a very different situation from the BAT box trimer .
Indeed , the CD20 promoter was not transactivated by Oct-2 in the context of HeLa cells .
Thus , when the BAT box is adjacent to a TATA box , it is efficiently transactivated in HeLa cells by Oct-2 , but when it is displaced 5 and in the context of a non-TATA box-containing promoter , it is inactive in Oct-2-transfected HeLa cells but functional in B lymphocytes .
There is evidence that the distance of the octamer motif from the TATA box modulates the capacity of the octamer binding proteins to transactivate the octamer ( 13 , 28 , 29 ) .
As was the case with the CD20 promoter in HeLa cells , neither Oct-1 or Oct-2 was able to transactivate the octamer in the context of a distal promoter in non-lymphoid cells ( 30 ) .
Furthermore , our results are consistent with those found with the Ig x and heavy chain promoter , where transcription can be stimulated in vitro by Oct-1 and Oct-2 , but Ig gene expression was induced only in a B cell context ( 27 , 31 ) .
These observation are perhaps best explained by a requirement for additional proteins when the octamer is displaced 5 which are present in B cells but not HeLa cells .
The flanking regions surrounding the BAT box in the context of the CD20 promoter may interact with additional nuclear factors which enhance the transactivation 5955 by Oct-2 .
For example , an additional element in the Ig heavy chain promoter near the octamer site has been identified which binds a novel protein which contributes to the transactivation of the Ig heavy chain promoter by Oct-2 ( 32 ) .
The Vk 19 promoter has a low affinity octamer binding site which needs a pyrimidine-rich upstream element for activity in B cells .
Alternatively , the presence in B lymphocytes of non-DNA binding proteins which interact with Oct-2 or Oct-1 to enhance transcription may also explain these results .
In vitro transcription of a x light chain promoter constructs were four to five times lower using HeLa cell nuclear extracts compared with B cell nuclear extracts .
Depletion and re-constitution experiments suggested that either there is a B cell-specific alteration of Oct-1 or Oct-2 , or alternatively there are associated proteins present in B cells and not HeLa cells ( 27 ) .
To verify the importance of the BAT box region in CD20 gene expression the BAT box was deleted from the CD20- , ; , -CAT construct .
Transfection of this construct and the wild type construct into B cells revealed a 50-70 % reduction in activity of the BAT box deleted construct versus the wild type construct .
This result again implicates the BAT box as important in the B cell-specific expression of the CD20 gene .
The results with the BAT box-deleted construct also indicate that there are other B cell-specific elements which are important in the promoter region which need to be defined .
Preliminary gel shift assays and in vivo footprinting studies have identified three other protein binding sites as potentially important in the first 454 bases of the CD20 promoter . ``
Studies with the human pre-B cell line PB-697 also implicated Oct-2 as a important transcription factor in the induction of CD20 expression at the pre-B cell stage .
Oct-2 has been shown to be induced in several murine pre-B cell lines ( 33 ) , and our data demonstrate that Oct-2 is inducible in PB-697 cells by treatment with PMA .
There are several lines of evidence which support a role for Oct-2 in the induction of CD20 .
First , the induction of Oct-2 mRNA precedes the induction of CD20 mRNA and protein expression .
Second , in contrast to the wild type CD20 promoter-CAT constructs , the BAT box-deleted CAT construct was inactive in PMA -treated PB-697 cells .
Third , the BAT box trimer was readily induced by PMA treatment , which is consistent with the induction of Oct-2 .
Finally , we noted on several occasions that PB-697 cells spontaneously became constitutively CD20 positive .
On further examination of these CD20-positive PB-697 cells , they were found to be constitutively Oct-2-positive .
Permanent transfection of Oct-2 into PB-697 cells is in progress to confirm this last observation .
In conclusion , analysis of the CD20 promoter via transfection of promoter CAT constructs into mature and pre-B cell lines and mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from similar cell lines has identified diverged octamer binding sites in the CD20 and CD21 promoters which bind Oct-1 and Oct-2 with relatively low affinity compared with standard octamer sequence .
Yet these sites are likely important both in the constitutive expression of CD20 and perhaps CD21 in mature B cells and in the induction of CD20 in early B cell develop-ment .
