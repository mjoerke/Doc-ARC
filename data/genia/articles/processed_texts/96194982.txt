Nossal , The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research , Victoria , Australia , December 27 , 1995 ( received for review November 2 , 1995 ) ABSTRACT The c-rel protooncogene encodes a subunit of the NF- « B-like family of transcription factors .
Mice lacking Rel are defective in mitogenic activation of B and T lymphocytes and display impaired humoral immunity .
In an attempt to identify changes in gene expression that accompany the T-cell stimulation defects associated with the loss of Rel , we have examined the expression of cell surface activation markers and cytokine production in mitogen-stimulated Rel~'- T cells .
The expression of cell surface markers including the interleukin 2 receptor & ( IL-2Ra ) chain ( CD25 ) , CD69 and L-selectin ( CD62 ) is normal in mitogen-activated Rel~/- T cells , but cytokine production is impaired .
In Rel~/~ splenic T cell cultures stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin , the levels of IL-3 , IL-5 , granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , tumor necrosis factor a ( TNF-a ) , and y interferon ( IFN-y ) were only 2- to 3-fold lower compared with normal T cells .
In contrast , anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulated Rel~~- T cells , which fail to proliferate , make little or no detectable cytokines .
Exogenous IL-2 , which restitutes the proliferative response of the anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-treated Rel~/~ T cells , restores production of IL-5 , TNF-a , and IFN-y , but not IL-3 and GM-CSF expression to approximately normal levels .
In contrast to mitogen-activated Rel~ `` ~- T cells , lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Rel~ `` ~ macrophages produce higher than normal levels of GM-CSF .
These findings establish that Rel can function as an activator or repressor of gene expression and is required by T lymphocytes for production of IL-3 and GM-CSF .
Rel/NF- « B transcription factors are homo- and heterodimeric proteins composed of subunits encoded by a small multigene family related to the c-re/ protooncogene ( 1 , 2 ) .
Rel/NF- « B factors regulate transcription by binding to decameric sequences ( « B motifs ) in the promoters and enhancers of many viral and cellular genes , in particular those that encode proteins involved in immune , acute phase and inflammatory responses ( 3-5 ) .
The five known mammalian Rel-related pro-teins , NF- « B1 ( p50 , p105 ) , NF- « B2 ( p52 , p100 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , RelB , and Rel share a conserved 300-amino acid N terminus [ Rel homology domain ( RHD ) ] that encompasses sequences required for DNA binding , protein dimerization , and nuclear localization ( 1-5 ) .
The C termini of Rel-related proteins are divergent , with those of Rel , RelA , and RelB containing transcriptional transactivation domains ( 1 , 4 ) .
In most cells prior to stimulation , a large proportion of Rel/NF- « B is retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form through association with regulatory IxB proteins ( 1-5 ) .
A wide range of stimuli promote Rel/NF- « B nuclear localization by a mecha- The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

3405 nism that involves phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the IxB proteins ( 6 ) .
Expression of the Rel subunit is largely confined to hemopoietic cells ( 7 , 8 ) .
In the B-lymphocyte lineage , increased Rel expression results in a qualitative change in the subunit composition of Rel/NF- « B proteins during the transition from a pre-B to a B cell ( 9-11 ) .
A rapid increase in nuclear levels of Rel ( 9 , 12 , 13 ) and increased c-ref transcription ( 14 ) during mitogenic activation of B and T cells implicates Rel in lymphocyte proliferation .
Such a function is also supported indirectly by the ability of the avian viral oncogene v-re/ to transform both B and T cells ( 15 ) .
While genes regulated by Rel/NF- « B that are critical for B-cell proliferation are yet to be identified , Rel is implicated in the transcription of a number of genes that are thought to be crucial for T-cell activation ( 5 ) .
Rel up-regulates the transcription of human interleukin 2 receptor a ( IL-2Ra ) chain promoter reporters ( 16 ) and Rel/ NF- « B is involved in IL-2 transcription ( 12 , 17-19 ) .
Rel/ NF- « B has also been implicated in transcriptional regulation of other cytokine genes expressed in activated T cells ( 5 , 18 ) .
The promoters of the genes encoding IL-3 , IL-5 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor a ( TNF-a ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and y interferon ( IFN-y ) contain « B sites or the « B-related CK1/CD28 response element ( CD28RE ; refs .
20 and 21 ) .
The CD28RE , which is involved in IL-2 ( 20 ) and GM-CSF ( 22 ) transcription , has recently been shown to bind Rel/NF- « B complexes ( 21 ) .
To better understand the physiological role of Rel , we have used gene targeting to generate mutant mice with an inacti-vated c-re/ gene ( 19 ) .
In these mice , the development of cells from all hemopoeitic lineages appears to be normal , but humoral immunity is impaired .
Mature B and T cells are largely unresponsive to a number of mitogenic stimuli and IL-2 expression is reduced in activated T cells ( 19 ) .
In an attempt to identify further changes in T-cell gene expression associated with the loss of Rel , we examined mitogen-activated Rel-'~- T cells for impaired regulation of cell surface activation markers and cytokines .
No differences were detected in expression of a range of cell surface markers .
However , production of IL-3 and GM-CSF , but not IL-5 , TNF-a , or IFN-y , was diminished .
In contrast to T cells , GM-CSF production by lipolysaccharide-stimulated Rel~ `` - resident peritoneal macrophages was higher than that of normal cells .
These findings directly implicate Rel in controlling expression of a subset of cytokine genes and indicate that Rel is important for positive and negative regulation of GM-CSF expression in different cell types .

4- to 6-week-old normal and Rel-deficient mice were stimulated for up to 72 hr in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol at a concentration of 5 % 10° cells per ml in the presence or absence of mouse recombinant IL-2 ( 200 units/ml ; Cetus ) with concanavalin A ( Pharmacia ) at 2 ug/ml , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ; Sigma ) plus ionomycin ( Sigma ) at 2 ng/ml and 1 ug/ml , respectively , or on tissue culture plates coated with monoclonal antibodies specific for mouse CD3 ( clone 145-2C11 ; ref .
23 ) and mouse CD28 ( clone 37.51 ; ref .
24 ) at antibody concentrations of 10 mg/m !
in the coating solution .
Resident peritoneal macrophages isolated from 6- to 8-week-old mice were first purified by adherence to plastic dishes for 3 hr and then cultured at 5 X 10° cells per ml in Dulbecco 's Modified Eagles medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum and lipopolysaccharide at 0.1 or 1 ug/ml for 24-48 hr .
Immunofluorescence Staining and Flow Cytometry .
The expression of the IL-2Ra chain ( CD25 ) , CD69 , and L-selectin ( CD62 ) were analyzed on T cells before and after 24 , 48 , and 72 hr of stimulation .
Cells were stained as described ( 25 ) with anti-Thy1.2-FITC ( clone 30H12 ; Becton Dickinson ) and with biotinylated monoclonal antibodies specific for IL-2Ra chain ( clone PC61 ) , CD69 ( clone H1.2F3 ) , or CD62/L-selectin ( clone Mel-14 ) or with a biotinylated isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody .
Binding of biotinylated antibodies was revealed by staining with phycoerythrin/streptavidin ( Caltag ) as the secondary reagent .
Cytokine Assays .
The levels of IL-3 , IL-5 , TNF-a , and GM-CSF in T-cell culture supernatants were determined by ELISA ( Pharmingen , San Diego , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
IL-3 levels were also determined by bioassay using IL-3-responsive 32D cells ( 26 ) , and the level of IFN-y was `` detected by using the IFN-y sensitive cell line WEHI279 as described ( 27 ) .
GM-CSF levels produced by stimulated peritoneal macrophages were determined by bioassay as described ( 28 ) .
All cytokine assays were standardized by including a titration of the appropriate purified recombinant cytokine of known activity .
RESULTS The Expression Pattern of T Cell Surface Markers Is Normal in Mitogen-Activated Rel-Deficient Cells .
Although expression of a wide range of cell surface markers was shown to be normal in naive Rel-deficient T cells ( 19 ) , a lack of response to certain modes of activation prompted a study of surface marker expression during mitogenic stimulation .
Changes in expression of a number of surface markers normally occurs with the onset of T-cell activation .
CD69 ( 29 ) , CD25/IL-2Ra chain ( 30 ) , CD44/Pgpl ( 30 ) , and the Fas/ Apo-1 ( CD95 ) receptor ( 31 , 32 ) are all up-regulated during T-cell stimulation , while L-selectin/CD62 ( 33 ) and the CD45 isoform CD45RB ( 33 ) are down-regulated .
Flow cytometry was used to monitor expression of these cell surface markers in normal and in Rel~'~ T cells stimulated over a 72-hr time course with PMA and ionomycin or with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 .
A representative sample of results from these experiments ( Fig .
1 ) clearly establishes that 72 hr poststimulation the expression of CD25 , CD69 , and MEL14 in response to both sets of stimuli is normal .
An examination of these and other cell surface markers after 24 and 48 hr of stimulation confirmed that the kinetics of expression on Rel~/~ T cells was also normal ( results not shown ) .
These results therefore document that Rel is not essential for expression of these proteins .
The Expression of IL-3 and GM-CSF Is Reduced in Mitogen-Stimulated Rel-Deficient T Cells .
Activated T cells secrete a number of cytokines that are critical in modulation of immune responses ( 34 ) .
The finding that Rel~ `` ~ T cells make reduced levels of IL-2 ( 19 ) prompted us to compare the cytokine secretion profile of normal and Rel~/~ T cells Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 93 ( 1996 ) stimulated with different mitogenic agents for 72 hr ( Table 1 ) .
Cytokine levels were consistently lower in stimulated Rel~'~ T cell cultures , with the relative difference in expression of each cytokine dependent on the stimulus .
For example , while cytokine levels in PMA plus ionomycin-stimulated Rel~/- T cells were equivalent to or only severalfold lower than in normal cultures , cytokine levels in anti-CD3 plus anti-CD2§-stimulated Rel~ `` ~ T cells were reduced 12- and ~80-fold for GM-CSF and IL-3 , respectively .
The poor proliferative response of anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28-stimulated Rel- `` ~ T cells compared with that elicited by PMA and ionomycin ( 19 ) prompted an examination of cytokine production by mitogen-stimulated cultures supplemented with IL-2 .
Addition of IL-2 , which restores Rel~'~ T cell proliferative responses to that of normal cells ( 19 ) , should distinguish between reduced cytokine production due directly to the loss of Rel or as a secondary effect resulting from the lack of proliferation .
These experiments ( Table 1 ) establish that defects in cytokine production by Rel~ `` ~ T cells fall into two groups .
The amount of IFN-y , TNF-a , and IL-5 now produced by stimulated Rel~ `` ~ T cells was similar to that of normal cells , indicating that reduced levels of these cytokines appear to be due to the impaired proliferative response .
In contrast , the amount of IL-3 and GM-CSF produced by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28-stimulated Rel~/~ cells supplemented with IL-2 was still 16- and 11-fold lower , respectively , than that made by normal T cells , indicating that Rel was essential for normal expression of these cytokines .
Rel Has Opposite Effects on Regulation of GM-CSF Expression in T Cells and Macrophages .
GM-CSF can be produced not only by activated T cells but also by a number of cell types including fibroblasts , macrophages , and endothelial cells in response to stimulation by cytokines , antigens , or inflammatory agents ( 35 ) .
Since Rel expression is largely confined to hemopoietic cells ( 7 , 8 ) , GM-CSF production was also examined in macrophages from Rel~ `` ~ mice .
In contrast to the reduced GM-CSF levels secreted by mitogen-stimulated Rel~ ' `` ~ T cells , resident Rel~'~ peritoneal macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide for 24 or 48 hr produce 10- to 50-fold more GM-CSF than normal macrophages ( Fig .
2 ) .
This did not appear to be a lipopolysaccharide concentration-dependent phenomenon , since 0.1 or 1 ug/ml of lipopolysaccharide per ml both resulted in elevated production of GM-CSF from Rel~'~ macrophages .
The basis for the slight reduction in GM-CSF levels produced by both the normal and Rel~ `` ~ cultures after 48 hr stimulation compared with that seen after 24 hr most likely reflects GM-CSF consumption by the macrophages .
Consistent with the levels of GM-CSF determined by bioassay and ELISA , Northern blot analysis confirmed that GM-CSF mRNA levels were reduced in Rel~ `` ~ T cells and elevated in Rel~ `` ~ macrophages compared with their normal counterparts ( S.G. and G.G .
, unpublished results ) .
Collectively , these results establish that Rel can function as both an activator and repressor of induced GM-CSF expression in different activated cell types .
DISCUSSION Changes in expression of many genes accompany T-cell activation ( 36 ) .
The finding that T cells from Rel~ `` ~ mice exhibit defects in proliferation and reduced IL-2 expression ( 19 ) prompted a detailed study of gene expression during the mitogenic activation of Rel~ `` ~ T cells .
The expression pattern of cell surface markers including CD25 , CD44 , CD45RB , CD69 , and CD95 , all of which normally change during T-cell activation ( 29-33 ) , were unaffected in Rel~/~- T cells .
The observation that Rel is not essential for basal or induced IL-2Ra chain gene expression in murine T cells was surprising .

Expression of cell surface activation markers on T cells from Rel~/~ mice .
Spleen cells from normal and Rel~ `` ~ mice were stimulated in tissue culture either with immobilized anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 or with PMA plus ionomycin .
Expression of IL-2Ra « chain ( CD25 ) , CD69 , and L-selectin ( CD62 ) was analyzed on T cells ( identified as being Th1.2 positive ) before and after 72 hr of stimulation .
Data are representative of three independent experiments and are presented as histograms of fluorescence intensity of Thy1.2-positive gated T cells .
of reporter constructs ( 16 ) and v-re/ upregulates avian IL-2Ra chain expression in Rev-T-transformed lymphoid cells ( 37 ) , a comparison of mouse and human IL-2Ra chain gene promoter sequences ( 38 ) may explain the basis of this unexpected species-specific difference .
The « B site in the human IL-Z2Ra chain promoter , 5-GGGAATCTCC-3 ' , differs from the sequence in the mouse gene , 5 -GGAATCCCCC-3 ' , the latter of which is a poor consensus binding site for Rel/NF- « B proteins ( 1 , 3 , 39 ) .
Collectively , these findings suggest that Rel is not important in murine IL-2Ra chain gene expression .
In contrast to the regulation of cell surface markers , cytokine gene expression is perturbed in Rel- `` ~ T cells .
The levels of IL-2 ( 19 ) , IL-3 , IL-5 , GM-CSF , TNF-a , and IFN-y were low or undetectable in concanavalin A or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28-stimulated Rel~/~ T-cell cultures .
Rescuing the proliferation of Rel~/~ T cells by adding IL-2 revealed that IL-5 , TNF-a , and IFN-y production was restored to normal levels , but expression of IL-3 and GM-CSF remained much lower than in the normal T-cell cultures .
These findings indicate that in this system expression of some but not all cytokine genes appear to be directly controlled in part by Rel and that cytokine production rather than cell surface marker expression may be a more accurate gauge of T-cell activation .

certain T-cell cytokines is consistent with cytokine production being intimately linked to proliferation , it remains a formal possibility that the IL-2-mediated rescue of IL-5 , IFN-y , and TNF-a expression in anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28-treated Rel-deficient T cells is associated with an aspect of T-cell activation that is independent of the IL-2-dependent proliferative response .
The transcriptional control regions of the IL-2 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF genes share a number of regulatory sequences including the CK1 or CD28RE , which is distinct from but related to the « B motif and has been shown to bind complexes containing NF- « BI1 , RelA , and Rel ( 21 ) .

- Level of GM-CSF produced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -activated Rel~'~ peritoncal macrophages is elevated compared with normal cells .
Resident peritoneal macrophages from normal ( open bars ) or Rel ~~ ( solid bars ) mice were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ( 0.1 or 1 ug/ml ) for 24 and 48 hr .
Each histogram represents the mean * SE from four or six experiments .
the IFN-y CD28RE differs by only 2 nucleotides from the consensus sequence , these changes reside in the 3 ' half-site , which is the most conserved region of the Rel binding element ( 39 ) .
Therefore , the ability of Rel to preferentially bind to particular CD28REs may account for the relative defects in expression of the different cytokine genes in the Rel~'~ T cells .
Despite evidence that phorbol ester and calcium ionophore treatment mimics activation mediated through cross-linking of the T-cell receptor and CD28 costimulatory receptor ( 18 ) , the relative levels of IL-3 and GM-CSF produced by normal and Rel~'~- T cells in response to these two stimuli differ .
The ability of PMA and ionomycin to induce IL-2 ( 19 ) , IL-3 , and GM-CSF , albeit several fold less than in control cells in the absence of Rel , may indicate that in T cells , Rel is either upstream of the point at which these agents engage a common intracellular pathway required for the transcription of these genes or that these agents operate through a distinct pathway .
Alternatively , PMA and ionomycin , but not anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 costimulation may activate other Rel family proteins or different transcription factors that substitute in part for Rel .
A comparative analysis of GM-CSF production by mitogen-activated Rel~'~ T cells and macrophages indicates that Rel can function both as an activator or repressor of gene expression .

Rel protein possesses these properties .
One plausible model that could explain how Rel is an activator of GM-CSF expression in T cells but a repressor of the same gene in macrophages is the modulation of Rel activity through interaction with different transcription factors in the two cell types .
This model is consistent with the ability of Rel/NF- « B proteins to associate with a number of transcription factors including ATF-2 ( 42 ) , SP1 ( 43 ) , and the C/EBP proteins ( 44 ) .
The finding described here could result from Rel associating with different Rel-like subunits or with unrelated proteins .
For exaniple , different high mobility group ( HMG ) proteins can determine whether Rel/NF- « B factors function as activators or repres-sors of transcription .
Binding of HMG I ( Y ) at sites adjacent to the « B element in the IFN-B gene augments both NF- « B binding and transcriptional activity ( 45 ) , while the DSP1 HMG protein binds to a negative regulatory element flanking the IFN-B « B site and converts NF- « B from a transcriptional activator to a repressor ( 46 ) .
The identification of genes whose expression is induced or repressed by Rel should provide a basis for elucidating the mechanism ( s ) governing the transcription regulatory properties of Rel/NF-KB factors .
