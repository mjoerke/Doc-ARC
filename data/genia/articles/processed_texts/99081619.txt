Mechanism of Interleukin-10 Inhibition of T-Helper Cell Activation by Superantigen at the Level of the Cell Cycle By George Q. Perrin , Howard M. Johnson , and Prem S. Subramaniam We have analyzed the effects of interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) on the entry of quiescent CD4+* T cells into the cell cycle upon stimulation with the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B ( SEB ) .
IL-10 arrested cells at Gy G4 .
IL-10 treatment prevented the downregulation of p27 `` P !
, an inhibitory protein that controls progression out of the G , phase of the cell cycle .
IL-10 also prevented the upregulation of the Gq cyclins D2 and D3 , proteins necessary for entry and progression through the G ; , phase of the cell cycle .
Associated with the inhibition of the cell cycle , IL-10 suppressed SEB induction of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) .
Addition of exogenous IL-2 to IL-10-treated cells significantly reversed the antiproliferative effects of IL-10 .
Moreover , IL-10 effects on the early G , proteins p27 `` P !
and cyclin D2 were similarly reversed by exogenous NTERLEUKIN-10 ( IL-10 ) is a multifunctional cytokine produced by B cells , stimulated macrophages , and subsets of CD4+* T cells .
It was originally termed cytokine synthesis inhibition factor due to its ability to inhibit production of some cytokines such as interferon y and interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . '
It has been shown to have both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive properties , depending on the target cell type .
IL-10 exerts immunostimulatory properties on B cells and mast cells and is a growth factor for immature thymocytes .
It exerts immunosuppressive effects on cells of the monocyte/macro-phage lineage** and also on subsets of activated helper CD4+ T cells , `` `` which are normally found in a quiescent or resting Gp state before activation .
However , little is known of the molecular effects of IL-10 on the progression of the target cells through the cell cycle .
The IL-10 receptor has been found on macro-phages and B cells as well as T cells , including murine CD4* T-cell clones . ``
'' Significant levels of IL-10 receptor mRNA has also been detected in human CD4* T-cell clones.8 The IL-10 receptor is a member of the class II ( interferon-like ) subgroup of the cytokine receptor family and has been found to have a high affinity for the IL-10 molecule .
* `` `` In this study , we have specifically examined the effects of IL-10 on the molecular events controlling the cell cycle of CD4+* T cells in peripheral blood after superantigen stimulation .

Although this reversal by IL-2 was pronounced , it was not complete , suggesting that IL-10 may have some effects not directly related to the suppression of IL-2 production .
Cell separation experiments suggest that IL-10 can effect purified CD4+ T cells directly , providing functional evidence for the presence of IL-10 receptors on CD4+* T cells .
IL-10 also inhibited expression of IL-2 transcriptional regulators c-fos and c-jun , w hich also inhibit other cell functions .
Our studies show that the mechanism of IL-10 regulation of quiescent CD4* T-cell activation is mainly by blocking induction of IL-2 that is critical to downregulation of and upregulation of D cyclins in T-cell activation and entry into the cell cycle .

phase of the cell cycle , two proteins act as mitogenic sensors .
These are the cyclin-dependent kinase ( cdk ) inhibitor p27°P !
and the D-type cyclins . '
'' These proteins act in a reciprocal fashion .
Mitogenic stimulation causes the destruction of the inhibitor p27® ' and the upregulation of cyclins D2 and D3 .
Cyclin D2 expression occurs early in the G ; phase and is followed later in G ; by the expression of cyclin D3 . ``
The inhibitor p27 `` itself inhibits the kinase activity of complexes formed between the D cyclins and select edks .
These cyclin-cdk complexes are responsible for the phosphorylation of key substrates required for continued G ; progression , an important one being the tumor-suppressor retinoblastoma protein pRB .
! ``
In general , the expression profiles of p27 `` and the D-type cyclins are faithful markers of the activation state of T cells .
In CD4* T cells , the downregulation of p27 `` and the upregulation of D-type cyclins upon mitogenic stimulation are dependent on the binding of IL-2 to its receptor .
!
The importance of p27© `` `` is underscored by the fact that immunosuppressive drugs such as rapamycin that prevent the activation of T cells do so by preventing the downregulation of p27 `` that occurs upon mitogenic stimulation . ``
In this study , we have used the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B ( SEB ) as the mitogen .
The superantigen SEB is a potent T-cell-specific mitogen that activates the T-cell receptor in a major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II-restricted manner .
'* Thus , SEB more closely resembles conventional antigens in terms of T-cell activation when compared with mitogens such as Concanavalin A ( ConA ) or phytohemaggluti-nin ( PHA ) .
Activation of T cells by mitogens such as superantigens induces the production of IL-2 .

° Our data show that IL-10 exerts its immunosuppressive effects on SEB-stimulated CD4+* T cells very early in the cell cycle .
IL-10 prevents the activation of quiescent CD4* T cells from the normal resting Gy state and their entry into the cell cycle .
This quiescent state is characterized by high levels of the cell cycle inhibitory protein p27 `` and low levels of the early D-type cyclin proteins that are associated with progression into the G ; phase of the cell cycle .
These effects occur in good part as a consequence of the inhibition of IL-2 production but may also involve other mechanisms affecting IL-2 receptor signaling .

IL-10 BLOCKS CELL CYCLING IN ACTIVATED T CELLS MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) and cell culture .
- Human cells were collected from the whole blood of normal healthy volunteers or from leukocyte source packs ( Civitan Regional Blood Center , Gainesville , FL ) .
PBMCs were isolated by Histopaque ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) density gradient centrifugation ' `` and viability was determined to be greater than 95 % by trypan blue exclusion .
For isolation of CD4* T cells , PBMCs were loaded onto CD4 T Cellect columns ( Biotex , Edmonton , Alberta , Canada ) as per the manufacturer 's recommendation and cell purity was assessed by flow cytometry .
Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % ( vol : vol ) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 200 U/mL penicillin , and 200 ug streptomycin in a 5 % CO ; atmosphere at 37°C and used immediately .
Proliferation assay .
- The proliferative response of PBMCs to SEB ( Toxin Technology , Sarasota , FL ) was determined by the incorporation of [ H ] thymidine into DNA .
Specifically , PBMCs were added to wells in a 96-well plate at a concentration of 3 X 10° cells/mL and were treated with either IL-10 ( Intergen , Purchase , NY ) at 10 U/mL or media alone and incubated for 48 hours .
Media or SEB was then added at the indicated concentrations and the cultures were incubated for another 48 hours in a final volume of 200 uL/well .
Next , 1 uCi of [ H ] thymidine ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) in media was added per well and the plates were incubated for 8 hours before harvest .
All experiments were performed in quadruplicate .
The proliferative response of purified CD4* T cells to SEB was performed in a similar manner , except that cells were added to the plates at a concentration of 2.5 X 10 `` cells/mL .
This was necessary to obtain substantial proliferation , as determined by experimentation .
These cells were only incubated with IL-10 for 2 hours before the addition of SEB .
Flow cytometry .
- PBMCs were added to 6-well plates at a concentration of 3 X 108 cells/mL and treated with IL-10 , SEB , and/or IL-2 ( Intergen ) at the indicated concentrations in a final volume of 5 mL .
Plates were incubated for the time indicated before harvest for flow cytometry analysis .
At harvest , cells were gently mixed and cell counts were performed .
Cells ( 1 X 10° ) were added to a 15-mL tube and washed twice with 12 mL cold standard azide buffer [ phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 5 % ( vol : vol ) FBS and 0.1 % ( wt : vol ) sodium azide ] , centrifuging each time at 500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C .
After carefully removing the supernatant , the cells were adjusted to 1 X 10 `` cells/mL by resuspending the pellet in 80 uL cold standard azide buffer and adding 20 uL fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -labeled anti-CD4 antibody ( Pharmingen , San Diego , CA ) and incubating on ice for 30 minutes in the dark .
Cells were then washed twice as described before .
For propidium iodide staining , the cells were then resuspended in 1 mL of a 0.112 % sodium-citrate buffer containing 50 ug/mL propidium iodide ( Sigma ) and 100 U/mL RNase A ( Sigma ) and allowed to stain for up to 1 hour at room temperature .
For intracellular staining of c-fos and c-jun proteins , the cells were harvested as before , washed with cold staining buffer [ PBS containing 1 % ( vol : vol ) FBS and 0.1 % ( wt : vol ) sodium azide } , and stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD4 antibody in staining buffer as described before .
After washing twice with cold staining buffer and once with cold PBS , the cells were fixed with 100 uL of 4 % ( wt : vol ) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes at 4°C .
The cells were then washed once with cold PBS and twice with cold permeabilization buffer [ staining buffer with 0.1 % ( wt : vol ) saponin ] .
The cells were then resuspended in 100 uL of permeabilization buffer containing 0.7 pug of either c-fos or c-jun specific rabbit antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) on ice for 30 minutes .
The cells were then washed twice with permeabilization buffer and resuspended in permeabilization buffer containing 0.7 ug of phycoerythrin-labeled antirabbit antibody ( Sigma ) on ice for 30 minutes .
The cells were again washed twice with permeabilization 209 buffer and washed once with staining buffer .
Finally , the cells were resuspended in 1 mL of staining buffer .
For all flow cytometry analysis , samples were filtered through 44-um nylon mesh and data from 30,000 events were acquired with a FACSort ( Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems , San Jose , CA ) using the LYSIS II software system .
Analysis of the cell cycle was performed using CellFIT software ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) .
Immunoblotting .
- PBMCs were cultured in 6-well plates and harvested as described above .
CD4 * T cells were then isolated by passing PBMCs over CD4 T Cellect columns ( Biotex , Edmonton , Alberta , Canada ) as per the manufacturer 's recommendations .
The resulting CD4* T cells were counted and stored at -70°C .
Cells were lysed at 4°C for 20 minutes in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 250 mmol/L NaCl , 1 % ( vol : vol ) Triton X-100 , 2 mmol/L EDTA , 2 mmol/L EGTA , 50 mmol/L NaF , 20 mmol/L B-glycerophosphate , 2 mmol/L Na-orthovanadate , aprotinin ( 10 pg/mL ) , leupeptin ( 10 pg/mL ) , pepstatin ( 10 ug/mL ) , benzamidine ( 5 ug/mL ) , and 1 mmol/L fluoride .
Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 RPM for 10 minutes and a BCA protein assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) was performed on the supernatants .
Equal amounts of protein from cell lysates ( 30 to 70 ug/lane ) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) gel electrophoresis .
After Western transfer , membranes were probed with 1.2 ug of anti-p27 P `` , anti-cyclin D2 , or anti-cyclin D3 antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnol-ogy ) and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) detection kit ( Amersham ) .
Densitometric analysis of radiographic film using IA-1000 Digital Image Analysis Software ( Alpha Innotech Corp , San Leandro , CA ) was used to determine fold increase or decrease between band intensities based on total pixel value .
IL-2 assay .
IL-2 levels were determined from cell-free culture supernatants stored at -70°C using IL-2 enzyme-linked immunosor-bent assay ( ELISA ) kits ( Intergen ) .
Assay protocol was conducted as described by the manufacturer .
All supernatant samples were tested in duplicate .
RESULTS IL-10 blocks SEB-induced proliferation in PBMCs .
IL-10 was first tested for its ability to inhibit superantigen-induced proliferation of human lymphocytes .
Human PBMCs were treated with IL-10 for up to 2 days before the addition of SEB .
These cultures were then incubated for up to 5 days , which was the time of optimal proliferation as reflected by [ °H ] thymidine incorporation .
IL-10 significantly inhibited SEB-induced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner ( data not shown ) , and an optimal concentration of 10 U/mL of IL-10 was determined .
Furthermore , as shown in Fig 1 , 10 U/mL of IL-10 inhibited PBMC proliferation over a wide range of concentrations of SEB .
Thus , IL-10 blocked SEB-induced PBMC proliferation .
IL-10 inhibits SEB-stimulated CD4* T cells from progressing through the cell cycle .
We next determined the stage of the cell cyele in which IL-10 blocked SEB-induced proliferation , looking specifically at CD4* T cells , which are one of the primary targets of superantigen stimulation .
After stimulation for up to 5 days , CD4* T cells were examined for cell cycle progression using FITC-labeled anti-CD4 antibodies and propidium iodide staining .
Preliminary experiments using SEB showed that CD4* T cells were entering the S phase between days 4 and 5 , although there was some variation among donors with respect to the percentage of cells in S phase at these times .
As shown in Table 1 , untreated cells were all essentially quiescent ( > 98 % Gy/G ; ) .

addition inhibited cell proliferation in the GyG : phase of the cell cycle to essentially the same extent .
The addition of IL-10 at 1 to 4 days after SEB resulted in progressively less inhibition of cell cycling .
The addition of IL-10 4 days after SEB allowed essentially the same percentage of cells to leave the G ; phase and enter the cell cycle as did cells treated with SEB and no IL-10 .
These data suggest that , once CD4+* T cells have been activated by mitogen and enter the cell cycle , IL-10 has no further effect on these cells .
Thus , it appears that IL-10 blocks the activation of quiescent CD4* T cells but not the subsequent proliferation of these cells .

To gain insight into how IL-10 blocked superantigen-induced activation in the GyG , phase of the cell cycle , we determined the effects of IL-10 on the tumor suppressor gene protein p27 `` ' and on the cyclins D2 and D3 in CD4* T cells .

levels are high in quiescent Gy cells and are rapidly reduced in cells induced to enter the cell cycle by mitogens , ' `` whereas cyclin D levels are low in quiescent cells and increase upon mitogenic stimula-tion . ``
'' In human T cells , cyclin D2 migrates as a doublet , with the faster migrating species representing the activated form . ``
'' PBMCs were incubated with IL-10 ( 10 U/mL ) for 2 days before the addition of SEB .
After incubating for the specified number of days , the CD4* T cells were isolated using negative selection chromatography columns and the cell extracts were subjected to Western analysis for p27 `` and cyclins D2 and D3 .
As shown in Fig 2 , untreated quiescent cells showed high levels of p27P `` .
Treatment with SEB dramatically reduced the levels of p27 `` !
by day 3.5 .
By comparison , the p27 `` level remained relatively high in cultures treated with IL-10 even in the presence of SEB .
The effect of IL-10 on the expression of p27 `` in SEB -treated cultures supports the conclusion that IL-10 inhibits cellular proliferation in the early Gy/G ; phase of the cell cycle .
IL-10 inhibits the upregulation of cyclins D2 and D3 in SEB-stimulated CD4* T cells .
The expression of cyclins D2 and D3 were also strongly affected by IL-10 treatment of SEB-stimulated CD4* T cells .

212 comparable amounts of both cyclin D3 and the faster migrating form of cyclin D2 over the same time period .
As mentioned earlier , p27 `` and the D-type cyclins behave as sensors for mitogenic stimuli and play a crucial role in the decision of cells to become activated , enter the cell cycle , and subsequently proliferate .
Taken together with the effects on p27 `` , these data demonstrate that IL-10 affects CD4¢* T cells very early in the cell cycle by antagonizing the ability of mitogens such as SEB to activate these cells to enter the cell cycle .
IL-10 inhibits SEB-induced IL-2 production .
The potent mitogenic activity of SEB requires the induction and autocrine effects of IL-2 for the activation of CD4* T cells .
IL-2 is the primary cytokine secreted by CD4* T cells that is responsible for the activation of competent T cells and their subsequent progression through the G ; phase of the cell cycle .
IL-10 has also been reported to block induction of IL-2 . ``
Thus , we next examined the role of IL-2 in this system and its effects on the cell cycle events affected by IL-10 .
As seen in Table 4 , treatment with IL-10 dramatically inhibited the amount of IL-2 produced during the time period of SEB stimulation .
These data represent IL-2 levels in supernatants taken from the same cell cultures analyzed in Fig 2 .
The changes in IL-2 levels are seen to precede changes in the cell cycle proteins .
We then measured the amount of IL-2 produced during the first 24 hours after SEB stimulation ( Table 5 ) to study the effect IL-10 has on IL-2 production during the time of initial T-cell activation .
IL-2 production was induced as early as 12 hours after the addition of SEB , and IL-10-treated cells showed significantly less IL-2 production than did cells incubated with SEB only .
In both cases , similar values were obtained when IL-10 was added 2 days before the addition of SEB and when IL-10 and SEB were added simultaneously ( data not shown ) .
Thus , IL-10 blocks induction of IL-2 in the SEB-stimulated cultures .
The addition of IL-2 reverses IL-10 's effects on cell cycle progression in SEB-stimulated CD4* T cells .
- Next , we determined the effect of the addition of IL-2 on the IL-10-induced suppression of SEB stimulation .
IL-2 at varying concentrations was added to PBMCs along with IL-10 and SEB .
The cells were Table 4 .

Table 6 shows that the addition of IL-2 overcame the suppressive effect of IL-10 in these cells and allowed them to become activated and progress from the GyG phase into S and G ; /M phases of the cell cycle .
This reversal of the IL-10 effect by IL-2 occurred in a dose-dependent manner .
A similar experiment was performed in which cells were incubated with IL-10 for 2 days before the addition of IL-2 and SEB ( Table 7 ) .
Results very similar to those in Table 6 were seen in which the addition of IL-2 reversed the Gy/G block imposed by IL-10 in a dose-dependent manner .

produce an approximately 50 % reversal of inhibition was similar to the concentration of IL-2 induced in cultures stimulated by SEB alone ( see Table 4 ) .
These IL-2 levels probably represent steady-state levels of IL-2 in culture supernatants .
These data strongly support the conclusion that one important mechanism by which IL-10 exerts its effects is by downregulat-ing the production of IL-2 , especially since pretreatment with IL-10 had no greater effect on the ability of IL-2 to reverse the cell cycle block .
In a few donors tested , as shown in Table 7 , IL-10 also inhibited cell cycle progression in cells stimulated with exogenous IL-2 , indicating that IL-10 may also interfere with the response of €CD4* T cells to IL-2 to varying extents .

( A ) PBMCs IL-2 ; 213 The addition of IL-2 partially reversed IL-10 's effects on cell cycle proteins p27 `` and cyclin D2 in SEB-stimulated CD4+ T cells .
- We next examined the effect of adding exogenous IL-2 on the levels of the cell cycle proteins p27 `` `` and cyclin D2 in CD4+* T cells .
We concentrated on p27 `` and cyclin D2 , because changes in p27 `` and cyclin D2 occur earlier in G as compared with cyclin D3 .
PBMCs were treated simultaneously with IL-10 , SEB , and IL-2 .
The CD4* T cells were then isolated and the cell extracts were subjected to Western analysis as described before .
As seen in Fig 3 , p27 `` levels again decreased in SEB-treated cultures by day 3.5 and remained high in cultures treated with IL-10 , as described earlier ( see Fig 2 ) .
The addition of IL-2 along with the IL-10 and SEB caused the p27©® `` levels to decrease to nearly those seen in cells treated with SEB only .
Figure 3 also shows the effects of adding IL-2 on the level of cyclins D2 .
The addition of IL-2 to cells treated with SEB and IL-10 significantly restored the expression of cyclin D2 .
These data thus demonstrate that one mechanism by which IL-10 inhibits entry into the G ; phase of the cell cycle is by the blockage of IL-2 production that is critical to the downregulation of p27 `` and the upregulation of early D-type cyclins in T-cell activation .
Absence of a complete block of p27 `` induction and restoration of the active form of cyclin D2 , as per Fig 3 , would suggest other possible IL-2-independent effects of IL-10 on CD4* T cells .
IL-10 reduced the levels of the IL-2 transcriptional regulators c-fos and c-jun in SEB-stimulated CD4* T cells .
To determine the effects of IL-10 on the production of IL-2 at the molecular level , we performed flow cytometry analysis looking specifically at the transcriptional regulatory proteins for IL-2 .
AP-1 is an important transcriptional regulator for IL-2 and is a heterodimer composed of the proteins c-fos and c-jun . ``
As seen in Fig 4 , flow cytometry showed an increase in the expression of both c-fos and c-jun proteins in CD4* T cells induced by treatment with SEB , consistent with the cells becoming acti- e® ® B o Bo 04 ® P e cae 4000 0 400 ko 4 o 40 4 were incubated in 6-well plates at 6 x 10° cells/mL along with IL-10 at 10 U/mL or media only .

We further show that the addition of IL-10 to these cultures along with SEB caused a decrease in the levels of the c-fos and c-jun proteins .
There appeared to be a stronger effect of IL-10 on the expression of c-fos than c-jun , but the reason for this is not known at this time .
These results are consistent with our data showing that IL-10 can significantly decrease the amount of IL-2 produced by cells stimulated with SEB and prevents CD4* T cells from becoming activated and entering the cell cycle .
IL-10 blocks proliferation of CD4* T cells .
To investigate the effects of IL-10 on CD4* T cells in the absence of antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) , we studied the antiproliferative effects of IL-10 on CD4* T cells in a system depleted of APCs .
CD4* T cells were isolated from PBMCs and their purity was verified by flow cytometry .
These CD4* T cells were stimulated either with SEB or a mixture of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and ionomycin and their proliferation was measured by [ H ] thymidine incorporation .
SEB is a unique superantigen in that it has been shown to directly activate T cells in the absence of APCs . ``
Figure 5A shows that SEB did induce CD4* T cells to proliferate in the absence of APCs and that IL-10 was able to significantly block this proliferation .
PHA , whose effects are known to be APC dependent , `` had a negligible effect on proliferation of the CD4* T-cell population used while also stimulating a population that contained APCs .
We also stimulated CD4 * T cells with varying mixtures of PMA and ionomycin , which can also directly activate CD4* T cells .
IL-10 significantly inhibited the proliferation of CD4* T cells at all of the PMA concentrations tested ( Fig 5B ) and also at various ionomycin concentrations tested ( data not shown ) .
These data show that IL-10 had a direct antiproliferative effect on CD4+* T cells and that these antiproliferative effects are independent of IL-10 's effects on APCs , such as downregulation of MHC class II molecules and downregulation of €CD80/86 PERRIN , JOHNSON , AND SUBRAMANIAM molecules .
Furthermore , these data provide functional evidence for the presence of IL-10 receptors on CD4* T cells .
DISCUSSION The immunosuppressive effects of IL-10 have been well documented in a number of different systems both in vitro and in vivo . ``
However , the mechanism of these effects at the level of cell cycle events is currently not known .
We showed here that IL-10 blocks SEB-stimulated CD4* T cells from entering the cell cycle .
Specifically , IL-10 treatment of cells prevented the downregulation of p27 P ' , a cell cycle inhibitory protein .

IL-10 BLOCKS CELL CYCLING IN ACTIVATED T CELLS phorylations that are required for moving cells out of Gy and through the G ; phase of the cell cycle . ``
IL-10 also prevented upregulation of the G ; cyclins D2 and D3 in SEB-stimulated CD4* T cells , which are necessary for the cells to enter the cell cycle .
Cyclin D2 has been shown to be present at low levels in resting T cells , whereas cyclin D3 is only detected after T-cell activation . ``
Thus , IL-10 blocked downregulation of p27 `` and upregulation of cyclins D2 and D3 , which provides a mechanism for its inhibition of lymphocyte activation .
Related to the inhibitory effects of IL-10 on CD4* T cells , IL-10 blocked SEB induction of IL-2 .
It has previously been shown that IL-10 blocked IL-2 induction , but the consequences of this in terms of cell cycle events have not been determined .
Addition of IL-2 to cultures treated with SEB in the presence of IL-10 reversed IL-10 inhibition of CD4* T-cell cycling .
This correlated with a downregulation of p27 `` and upregulation of cyclin D2 .
Furthermore , because pretreatment with IL-10 did not significantly affect responses to IL-2 , it suggests that events affecting the binding of IL-2 to its receptor are probably not involved in the immediate effects of IL-10 .
However , the reversal by exogenous IL-2 of the effects on the cell cycle proteins p27°® `` and cyclin D2 was not complete .
Thus , it appears that IL-10 acts by IL-2-independent mechanisms in addition to suppressing induction of IL-2 .
We have observed in some instances that IL-2 alone can induce a proliferative response , which varied between donors .
However , even in these instances the ability of these cells to respond to IL-2 can be suppressed by IL-10 .
This would suggest that IL-10 could possibly affect signals that do not directly stem from IL-2 but are nonetheless required in conjunction with IL-2-induced signals in mediating a mitogenic response .
IL-10 was examined for its effect on inhibiting upregulation of the AP-1 transcription factors c-fos and c-jun .
These proteins are involved in activation of the IL-2 gene as well as a number of other cytokines involved in cell growth . ``
'' Treatment with IL-10 caused a decrease in the amounts of both c-fos and c-jun proteins in SEB-stimulated CD4* T cells .
Thus , the effects of IL-10 on c-fos and c-jun could contribute to the inhibition of IL-2 induction .
Given the broad gene-target specificity of c-fos and c-jun , it is probable that IL-10 may also have effects that go beyond the early blockage of IL-2 production .
IL-10 receptors have been shown to be present on murine CD4* T cells and CD4+* T-cell clones of the Ty1 subtype . ``
In addition , significant levels of IL-10 receptor mRNA have been detected in human CD4+* T-cell clones .
Consistent with these data , we have demonstrated that IL-10 directly affects the proliferation of purified human CD4+* T cells in response to both the superantigens such as SEB and T-cell mitogens such as PMA and ionomycin .
Our data provide further functional evidence for the presence of IL-10 receptors on human CD4* T cells .
Recent studies have shown that IL-10 induced an anergic state in human CD4+ T cells stimulated with alloantigens or cross-linked with anti-CD3 antibodies . ``
These studies involved the long-term treatment of cells with IL-10 in which the cells become unresponsive to IL-2 .
Although we have not directly studied the effect of long-term treatment with IL-10 , we found that pretreatment of cells for up to 2 days with IL-10 did not affect the ability of IL-2 to reverse the cell cycle block .
215 Thus , our data , along with those of others , `` `` would suggest that the effects of IL-10 are twofold .
Short exposures to IL-10 produce an immediate inhibition of the activation of CD4* T-cell entry into the cell cycle that is IL-2 dependent and is reflected by high levels of p27 `` and low levels of cyclin D2 .
This phase is reversible by IL-2 .
However , continued treatment with IL-10 apparently produces permanent changes in these cells that ultimately makes them unresponsive to IL-2 and renders the cells anergic .
The mechanism of this shift to a permanent state of IL-2 unresponsiveness remains unclear .
IL-10 is produced relatively late in the immune response and is thought to be important in the shift from a cell-mediated response to an antibody-mediated response .
In this regard , IL-10 functions in a paracrine fashion , affecting neighboring cells .
Because IL-10 effectively blocked cell cycling in the presence of SEB , our data suggest that IL-10 can prevent naive CD4* T cells from being activated even when they are subsequently presented with antigen .
This highlights an important use for IL-10 as an immunosuppressive drug .
Furthermore , when compared in this fashion , immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A and FK506 would be expected to resemble IL-10 in their effects on the cell cycle .
These drugs act to prevent T-cell activation primarily by blocking IL-2 synthesis* `` and , thereby , presumably also preventing the cell cycling of target cells in a manner analogous to IL-10 .
This is in contrast to drugs such as rapamycin that act by blocking signaling after the binding of IL-2 to its receptor . ``
'' Rapamycin , like IL-10 , also prevents the downregulation of p27 `` , but this effect can not be reversed by exogenous IL-2 . ``
Overall , our results suggest the importance of IL-10 in regulating the cell cycle proteins necessary for stimulated CD4+* T cells to enter the cell cycle and implicate IL-2 as a key cytokine that mediates the early short-term immunosuppressive effects of IL-10 on the cell cycle .
However , failure of IL-2 to completely reverse the IL-10 effects would suggest some direct effects of IL-10 on CD4* T cells .
