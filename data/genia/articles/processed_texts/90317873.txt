8 The Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) BMRF1 Promoter for Early Antigen ( EA-D ) Is Regulated by the EBV Transactivators , BRLFIl and BZLF1 , in a Cell-Specific Manner ELIZABETH A. HOLLEY-GUTHRIE , E. BYRD QUINLIVAN , ENG-CHUNG MAR , anp SHANNON KENNEY* Lineberger Cancer Research Center and Department of Medicine , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599-7295 Received 6 February 1990/Accepted 8 May 1990 The Epstein-Barr virus early antigen diffuse component ( EA-D ) is essential for Epstein-Barr virus DNA polymerase activity , and its activity is suppressed during latent infection .
We investigated the regulation of the promoter ( BMRF1 ) for this early gene by studying its responsiveness in vitro to two immediate-early viral transactivators , BZLF1 ( Z ) and BRLF1 ( R ) , focusing on the differences in response in lymphoid cells and epithelial cells .
In lymphoid cells , Z or R alone produced only small increases in EA-D promoter activity , whereas both transactivators together produced a large stimulatory effect .
In epithelial cells , the Z transactivator alone produced maximal stimulation of the EA-D promoter ; the effect of R and Z together was no greater than that of Z alone .
Deletional analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the EA-D promoter demonstrated that in epithelial cells the potential AP-1 binding site plays an essential role in Z responsiveness , although sequences further upstream are also important .
In lymphoid cells , only the upstream sequences are required for transactivation by the Z/R combination , and the AP-1 site is dispensable .
These data suggest that EA-D ( BMRF1 ) promoter regulation by Z and R is cell type specific and appears to involve different mechanisms in each cell type .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a herpesvirus that infects primarily B cells and epithelial cells ( 17 , 28 , 32 ) .
EBV infection of B cells is predominantly latent , whereas epithelial-cell infection is often productive ( 28 ) , raising the question of whether there are different mechanisms for regulation of viral expression in lymphoid and epithelial cells .
Overexpression of the immediate-early ( IE ) EBV gene product , BZLF1 , in EBV-infected B cells is sufficient to convert latent expression to productive infection ( 10 , 13 , 29 , 33 ) .
The BZLFl gene ( Z ) encodes a 34- to 38-kilodalton nuclear protein ( the Z protein ) which has sequence similarity to the DNA-binding site of the c-fos protein and binds to the AP-1 binding site ( 7 ) , although there is no potential leucine zipper ( 36 ) in the Z protein .
Exactly how the Z protein binds to the AP-1 site , or whether binding of Z to AP-1 or closely related sites is always required for transactivation of target promoters , is still unknown .
Although the Z protein appears to play a key role in determining whether EBV infection is latent or productive , the disruption of latency is likely to involve other EBV transactivators .
Two other EBV IE gene products have been shown to encode transactivator functions .
The BMLF1 gene product has been shown by several groups to transactivate a number of homologous and heterologous promoters ( 4 , 14 , 16 , 24 , 37 ) linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) .
However , we have shown that the BMLFI1 effect is reporter gene dependent and does not result in significantly increased levels of mRNA ( 14 ) .
The role of the BMLF1l gene in induction of lytic viral infection remains unknown .
The BRLF1 gene also encodes an IE transactivator function ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 11 , 12 ) .
The BRLF1 gene product is a 94- to 98-kDa protein which localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm ( 5 , 26 ) .
As shown by cDNA analysis , the BRLF1 protein ( R ) is derived from a bicistronic mRNA which also encodes the * Corresponding author .
3753 Z protein ( 25 ) , suggesting that the regulation of Z and R is tightly linked .
The R transactivator , in contrast to Z , can not disrupt viral latency when transfected and overexpressed in cells ( 5 ) .
Several EBV early promoters are transactivated by either Z or R. The genes activated by Z include BMLF1 , BMRF1 , the BZLF1 gene itself , and the divergent promoter ( DR/DL ) ( 1-5 , 12 , 13 , 23 , 25 , 31 , 35 ) .
Z-responsive elements in these promoters have been mapped within 100 base pairs ( bp ) of the TATA box , and the response elements have included AP-1 ( or closely related ) binding sites .
The R transactivator activates the DR promoter and the BMLF1 promoter ( 1-3 , 5 , 12 ) .
The R-responsive regions in both of these promoters reside within upstream enhancer elements , and both of these R-responsive elements contain the same 14-bp sequence motif , CCGTGGAC/GAATGTC .
Whether the R transactivator binds to DNA is unknown at present .
In the work described in this paper , we have studied the regulation of the EBV BMRF1 early promoter , EA-D .
The BMRFl gene encodes the early antigen diffuse ( EA-D ) protein , which is an essential component of the viral DNA polymerase activity ( 22 ) .
EA-D activity is suppressed in latent infection and reactivated during productive infection ( 6 ) .
We show here that the EA-D promoter is differentially regulated in lymphoid and epithelial cells .
In epithelial cells , the Z transactivator alone is sufficient to transactivate the EA-D promoter .
In contrast , in lymphoid cells , Z transactivation of the EA-D promoter cells is inefficient unless the R transactivator is also present .
We demonstrate here that the potential AP-1 binding site in the EA-D promoter is essential for Z-induced transactivation in epithelial cells , but is not required for the Z/R combined effect in lymphoid cells .

CAT assays .
Cells were transfected with 10 ug of plasmid DNA as described above .
At 48 h after transfection , a cell extract was prepared and incubated at 37°C with [ '*C ) chloramphenicol in the presence of acetyl coenzyme A as described previously ( 9 ) .
The percent acetylation of chloramphenicol was quantitated by thin-layer chromatogra-phy followed by autoradiography and scintillation counting .
If results were not in the linear range ( less than 70 % chloramphenicol acetylation ) , CAT assays were repeated with less extract .
RNA analysis .
To quantitate CAT mRNA , we prepared cytoplasmic RNA 24 h after transfection as previously described ( 8 ) .
A 20-bp oligonucleotide primer homologous to the CAT gene in the region 15 to 34 bp downstream of the ATG codon was synthesized and end labeled with [ y > P ] JATP .
Labeled oligonucleotide ( 10° cpm ) was hybridized overnight with cytoplasmic RNA in a solution containing 80 % formamide , 40 mM PIPES [ piperazine-N , N'-bis ( 2-ethanesulfonic acid ) } , 400 mM NaCl , and 1 mM EDTA .

Effect of the Z and R transactivators on the BMRF1 ( EA-D ) early promoter versus the BMLFI1 IE promoter .
A 5-ug portion of either the pM-CAT plasmid ( 12 ) ( which contains the primarily R-responsive BMLF1 promoter ) or the pEA-CAT plasmid ( -331 to +1 ) , which contains the early EA-D promoter , was cotransfected with 5 ug of either pEBV-ZIE ( which encodes Z ) , pEBV-RIE ( which encodes R ) , or both transactivators together .
CAT assays were performed as described previously ( 9 ) .
CAT assay results are presented as fold induction over basal levels .
In lymphoid cells ( Louckes and Jurkat ) , the combination of R and Z is required for maximal stimulation of the EA-D promoter , whereas R alone is sufficient for maximal stimulation of the BMLF ] construct .
In epithelial cells ( HeLa and HEp-2 ) , Z alone produces maximal transactivation of the EA-D promoter , whereas R alone is sufficient for maximal stimulation of the BMLF1 promoter .
Mutants were made by using a synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the region to be altered except for a limited internal mismatch .
For screening possible mutants , synthetic oligonucleotides were created such that in vitro mutations would create a new Pvull restriction site which allows each possible mutant to be analyzed by digestion with restriction endonucleases .
Following initial screening , potential mutants were sequenced with the Sequenase 2.0 enzyme sequencing kit ( United States Biochemical Corp. ) to identify the mutation .
RESULTS The EA-D promoter is differentially regulated in lymphoid and epithelial-cell types .
We have previously reported that the EA-D promoter can be stimulated in both EBV-positive and EBV-negative cell lines by cotransfection with the Z transactivator plasmid ( 13 ) .
In this study we examined the effects of the Z and R transactivators alone and in combination on EA-D promoter activity in different cell types .
Figure 3 illustrates representative CAT assays in which the pEA-CAT plasmid was cotransfected into various cell types with either the pEBV-ZIE plasmid ( which encodes BZLF1 ) or the pEBV-RIE plasmid ( which encodes BRLF1 ) , or both transactivators together .
In either B or T lymphoid cell lines ( Louckes and Jurkat ) , the EA-CAT promoter activity was only slightly increased CELL-SPECIFIC REGULATION OF AN EBV PROMOTER 3755 on cotransfection with either Z or R. However , when pEA-CAT was cotransfected with both transactivators together in lymphoid cells , a large stimulatory effect was obtained .
This synergistic effect of Z and R together was observed with either the pEBV-ZIE and pEBV-RIE plasmids in combination or the pEBV-RZ plasmid alone , which expresses the bicistronic Z/R mRNA .
In contrast , the plasmid pM-CAT , which contains the promoter of the EBV BMLF1 gene and has been previously shown to be primarily R responsive ( 12 ) , is transactivated equally well by either R alone or the combination of Z and R in Jurkat cells .
In the epithelial-cell lines Hela and HEp-2 , the Z transactivator alone produced a large stimulatory effect on pEA-CAT activity .
As in lymphoid cells , the R transactivator alone produced only a small effect .
When both transactivators were cotransfected into epithelial cells , the effect of Z and R together upon EA-CAT activity was no greater than that of Z alone .
The pM-CAT plasmid , as expected , was efficiently transactivated by either R alone or the R and Z combination in HeLa cells .
These data suggest that the Z transactivator alone is sufficient to activate EA-D promoter activity maximally in epithelial cells .
In contrast , both Z and R are required for efficient EA-D promoter transactivation in lymphoid cells .
RNA analysis .
Previous studies have shown that both the Z- and R-induced transactivation of reporter gene coristructs is associated with a similar increase in steady-state RNA levels ( 12 , 13 ) .
In this study we analyzed the effect of the Z/R transactivator combination on the steady-state level of pEA-CAT RNA in lymphoid cells .
In the experiment shown in Fig .
4 , 5 ug of the pEA-CAT construct was cotransfected into Jurkat cells with 5 ug of either pHD1013 ( lane B ) or the pEBV-RZ transactivator construct ( lane C ) .
Lane A contains untransfected Jurkat RNA .
Cytoplasmic RNA was harvested 24 h after transfection and hybridized to a y-*P-labeled primer homologous to the CAT gene sequence 15 to 34 bp downstream of the ATG codon , and primer extension was performed as described in Materials and Methods .
Primer extension analysis clearly demonstrated an increase in the steady-state level of pEA-CAT mRNA after cotransfection with the Z/R transactivators .
The mRNA start site , which mapped to EBV sequence 79897 , was not altered in the presence of the two transactivators .
Localization of the Z- and R-responsive regions in the EA-D promoter .
To define the Z- and R-responsive region ( s ) of the EA-D promoter , we created a series of 5 ' deletion mutants of the pEA-CAT plasmid .
These deletions are illustrated in Fig .
1 .
The parent pEA-CAT plasmid contains EBV nucleotides 79537 to 79898 ( -331 to +1 ) relative to the RNA start site .
Four deletion plasmids were constructed ( Fig .
1 ) which delete progressively larger fragments of the upstream 5 ' promoter sequences .
The smallest construct , pEA-CAT ( -62 to +29 ) contains only 62 bp upstream of the cap site .
A potential AP-1 binding site is located between -57 and -64 relative to the start site .
The effects of the Z , R , and Z/R transactivating proteins on these pEA-CAT 5 ' deletions are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 .
In lymphoid cells ( Table 1 ) , the data indicate that maximum - transactivation of the parent pEA-CAT is achieved only when both Z and R are present .
The effect of the Z transactivator alone could be significantly increased by deleting the sequences from -331 to -265 , although even with this construct the effect of Z and R together was greater than that of Z alone ( 85.3-fold transactivation versus 18.8-fold ) .
A progressive loss of response to the Z transactivator alone , or the Z-plus-R combination , occurred as 5 ' 3756 HOLLEY-GUTHRIE ET AL .

Primer extension analysis of pEA-CAT RNA .
The pEA-CAT plasmid was cotransfected into Jurkat cells with 5 ug of either the pHD1013 vector ( lane B ) or the Z/R transactivating plasmid , pEBV-RZ ( lane C ) .
RNA ( 50 pg ) from untransfected Jurkat cells ( lane A ) or pEA-CAT transfected cells was hybridized overnight with a y-*P-labeled oligonucleotide primer homologous to CAT gene sequences 15 to 34 bp downstream of the ATG codon .

were deleted .
In epithelial cells , the 17-bp region between -79 and -62 ( which contains a portion of the potential AP-1 binding site ) also contributed to Z responsiveness , since the pEA construct ( -79 to +1 ) was 13-fold more responsive to Z than the pEA construct ( -62 to +29 ) .
The effect of R alone in HeLa cells was too small to be accurately mapped .
Role of the AP-1 consensus site in Z and R transactivation of the EA-D promoter .
To better define the role of the AP-1 consensus site in Z- and Z/R-induced transactivation of the EA-D promoter in different cell types , we constructed a series of site-directed mutants of the EA-CAT construct by using in vitro mutagenesis .
To facilitate these studies , we transferred the EA-D promoter sequences and CAT gene from the pEA-CAT construct into a Bluescript M13 SK+ phagemid vector to create the construct pEA-BS-CAT .
Using the method of Kunkel et al .
( 19 , 20 ) , the 6 bp defining the AP-1 binding site in pEA-BS-CAT was specifically altered as shown in Table 3 , leaving the rest of the promoter unchanged .
In addition , since analysis of the 5 ' deletion mutants suggested that sequences further upstream from the potential AP-1 site may also contribute to Z/R transactivation , three other site-directed mutants were constructed which each remove potential AP-l-like binding sites lying between -197 and -240 .
One additional mutant , which alters a sequence ( -185 to -198 ) containing a 10-of-14-bp similarity to the shared R-response sequence region of the DR and BMLF1 enhancers ( 1-3 , 12 ) was also constructed .
The effects of the Z , R , and Z/R transactivators on these site-directed mutants are shown in Tables 4 and 5 .
The AP-1 site-directed mutation in pEAAAPI-CAT decreased Z-induced transactivation in HeLa cells by more than 20-fold , confirming that the AP-1 consensus site plays a major role in EA-D regulation in epithelial cells .

effect on the ability of Z and R together to transactivate the EA-D promoter , suggesting that the ability of R to interact synergistically with Z in lymphoid cells is not mediated by increased Z binding to the consensus AP-1 site .
None of the other site-directed mutants significantly affected Z or Z-plus-R transactivation in either cell type .
DISCUSSION We have demonstrated in these studies that EA-D ( BMRF1 ) promoter regulation by the Z and R IE transactivators is cell type specific and appears to involve different mechanisms .
In epithelial cells , the Z gene product efficiently transactivates the promoter for the EA-D early gene , whereas effective transactivation of the same promoter in lymphoid cells requires the addition of the R transactivator .
These differences in transactivation efficiency correlate with different mechanisms of transactivation .
In epithelial cells , the potential AP-1 binding site , in addition to promoter sequences further upstream ( -214 to -265 ) , is required for Z response .
In lymphoid cells , the AP-1 site is dispensable for Z-plus-R transactivation , although the upstream regulatory sequences ( -214 to -265 ) are essential .
Therefore , the ability of the R and Z transactivators to synergistically activate the EA-D promoter in lymphoid cells appears to involve a mechanism independent of Z binding to the AP-1 site .
The regulation of the EA-D promoter by Z and R is distinct from that of other EBV promoters previously stud-ied .
We have previously shown that another EBV promoter , BMLF1 , responds to the R transactivator in either TABLE 4 .

EBV-positive or EBV-negative lymphoid and epithelial cells , and mapped the R-response region in this promoter to a 140-bp enhancer element ( 12 ) .
Several investigators have reported that in addition to R , the BMLF1 promoter can be activated ( although to a much lesser extent ) by the Z transactivator , and they have mapped the Z-response region to an AP-1 site ( 1 , 12 , 30 , 35 ) .
Our studies suggest that the regulation of the BMLF1 and BMRFI1 ( EA-D ) promoters by the Z and R transactivators is clearly different .
The BMLF1 promoter is primarily R re-sponsive , and the effect of R and Z together is no greater than that of R alone ( at least when levels of R and Z are not limiting ) ( 12 ) .
Furthermore , no tissue specificity in the effects of R or Z on BMLFl promoter activity has been observed ( 1 , 12 ) .
Unlike the case with BMRF1 , in the BMLF1 promoter the R-responsive and Z-responsive regions of the promoter clearly map to separate regions .
Studies involving the EBV divergent promoter and BHRF1 ) have shown that the R and Z transactivators are both involved in the regulation of this complex element .
The R-responsive region of this promoter element can be clearly mapped to an enhancer region which contains a 14-bp sequence similar to a sequence in the R-responsive enhancer of the BMLF1 promoter ( 1-3 , 12 ) .
The Z transactivator also activates the BHLF ] 1 promoter .
Lieberman et al .
( 23 ) have reported that regulation of the BHLF1 promoter by Z is tissue specific , with the response region to Z being located in sequences between -7 and -155 in Vero cells but localized within sequences further upstream in EBV-positive lymphoid cells .
However , it is possible that the Z effect observed in EBV-positive cells was actually mediated by the R transactivator and did not represent true tissue-specific differences in Z response elements .
Although the DR enhancer region can be activated by R alone and not by Z alone , Cox et al .
have recently reported that the combination of R and Z activates the DR enhancer synergistically ( 5 ) .
This synergistic effect of the Z-plus-R combination on the DR enhancer element is different from the EA-D promoter effect described here in several ways .
The EA-D effect is tissue specific , with synergy occurring in lymphoid cells but not epithelial cells .
Although the EA-D promoter appears to be primarily Z responsive in epithelial cells , at least when the Z and R transactivators are tested separately , the DR enhancer is primarily R responsive ( 2 , 3 , 5 , 11 ) .
The DR enhancer has a clearly mapped R response region which contains the 14-bp element CCGTGGACAAT GTC ( similar to the R response element in the BMLFI promoter ) and can transfer R responsiveness to heterologous promoters .
In contrast , the effect of R alone on the EA-D promoter is minimal and does not map to a single region of the promoter .
Interestingly , the EA-D promoter does con 3758 HOLLEY-GUTHRIE ET AL .
tain the sequence GCCTGACCAATGTC ( from -185 to -198 ) , which has a 10-of-14-bp similarity to the 14-bp element shared by the BMLF1 and DR enhancers .
However , the site-directed mutant EAAZB4-CAT , which mutates 6 bp of the above sequence , continues to response to the Z-plus-R combination .
These data together suggest that the ability of Z and R to act synergistically upon the EA-D promoter and DR enhancer elements may occur through different mechanisms .
It is not clear why the Z effect in epithelial cells is greater with the pEA ( -79/+1 ) construct than with the pEA ( -214/ +29 ) construct .
There may be two separate Z response elements , one located between -214 and -264 and the other located between -79 and -62 .
In this regard , we have found that the BstEII-BstXI fragment ( -79 to -264 ) is not sufficient to transfer Z or Z/R responsiveness to the simian virus 40 early promoter in pA1lOCAT ( 21 ) ( E. Guthrie et al .
, unpublished results ) , suggesting that both the upstream and downstream response elements may be required for maximal transactivation .
In epithelial cells , the ability of Z to transactivate the downstream response element may be inhibited by sequences between -79 and -214 .
Interestingly , the BHLF1 promoter sequences located between -155 and -417 have been shown to exert a similar negative effect in the ability of Z to transactivate this promoter in Vero cells ( 23 ) .
Alternatively , the increased length of RNA leader sequences in the -214/+29 and -62/+29 constructs may inhibit the effect of Z .
In either case , the importance of the potential AP-1 binding site ( located between -57 and -64 ) for Z transactivation in epithelial cells was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the AP-1 site .
Exactly why the Z protein alone is sufficient to activate the R promoter in epithelial cells , yet both the Z and R proteins are required for maximum activation of lymphoid cells , is still speculative .
Perhaps there is a cellular factor expressed in epithelial cells that replaces the function of the R protein .
If so , the mechanism of this hypothetical epithelial-cell factor must be different from the mechanism of R , since the AP-1 site is dispensable for the Z-plus-R interaction , but not when Z alone is used in epithelial cells .
There may be a factor present in lymphoid cells , but lacking in epithelial cells , that inhibits efficient binding of Z to the AP-1 site .
In this case the helper role of R in lymphoid cells might involve binding by Z to alternative upstream binding sites .
Alternatively , the effect of Z plus R in lymphoid cells might involve direct EA-D binding by the R protein ( with Z providing a helper function in this case ) .
A particularly interesting possibility is that Z and R might act synergistically through protein-protein interactions .
Distinguishing between these possibilities will require further protein-DNA binding stud-ies .
The findings presented here with Jurkat and HeLa cells do not necessarily correlate with the regulation of EBV infection in vivo , since neither of these cell types can actually be infected by EBV .
It is possible that the differences observed in EA-D promoter regulation in Jurkat cells and HeLa cells are due to differences in the degree of cell differentiation ( since EBV tends to be more productive in more differentiated cells ) rather than to tissue-specific differences .
Never-theless , these findings may well have biological relevance in EBV infection .
The tendency for EBV infection to remain latent in lymphoid cells may relate to the requirement in this cell type for both transactivating proteins , Z and R , to be expressed if transactivation of certain crucial promoters such as EA-D and the DR enhancer element is to occur .
Likewise , the ability of Z alone to activate certain promoters J. Viror .
in epithelial cells , but not lymphoid cells , may contribute to the relative permissiveness of this cell type for productive viral infection .
The requirement for R transactivation ( in addition to Z ) for activation of certain promoters in lymphoid cells suggests that R function is likely to be crucial in the disruption of viral latency in lymphoid cells .
However , whether the R transactivating function is also required for productive infection of epithelial cells remains to be deter-mined .
