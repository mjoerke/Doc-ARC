Role of Egr-2 in Up-regulation of Fas Ligand in Normal T Cells and Aberrant Double-negative Ipr and gid T Cells* ( Received for publication , September 2 , 1998 , and in revised form , November 13 , 1998 ) Paul R. Mittelstadt and Jonathan D. Ashwell $ From the Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology , NCI , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892-1152 We previously identified a Fas ligand regulatory element ( FLRE ) in the Fas ligand ( fasL ) promoter that binds Egr family proteins and demonstrated that Egr-3 ( PILOT ) but not Egr-1 ( NGFI-A , Krox-24 , Tis-8 , and Zif-268 ) induces transcription of fasL .
The aberrant CD4TCD8~ T cells from Ipr/ipr and gid/glid mice , which have mutations in the genes encoding Fas and FasL , respectively , have an activated phenotype and constitutively express high levels of fasL mRNA , prompting us to ask what role if any the FLRE and Egr family proteins have in this aberrant expression of fasL .
Unstimulated MRL-Ipr/ipr and C3H-gid/gld CD4~-CD8~ T cells constitutively contained high levels of two proteins that bound to the FLRE .
Supershift analysis revealed these proteins to be Egr-1 and Egr-2 ( Krox-20 ) ; Egr-3 was not detected .
Activation of normal lymph node cells resulted in increased expression of Egr-1 , -2 , and -3 .
As with egr-3 , expression of egr-2 was blocked by cyclosporin A .
Although overexpressed Egr-1 was ineffective , overexpressed Egr-2 was as potent as Egr-3 in inducing fasL promoter-dependent reporter constructs in T cell hybri-domas and Hela cells , and both up-regulated endoge-nous fasL mRNA in HeLa cells .
FasL-dependent reporter constructs in MRL-Ipr/ipr and C3H-gld/gid CD4 -CD8~ T cells were constitutively active , and this activity was largely prevented by mutation of the critical Egr family binding element .
Thus , Egr-2 , in addition to Egr-3 , regulates FasL expression in activated normal T cells , and Egr-2 is likely to play a direct role in aberrant fasL up-regulation in Ipr/ipr and gid/gld CD4_-CD8~_ T cells .
Apoptotic death of T cells at the conclusion of an immune response is critical for homeostasis of the immune system .
T cell receptor ( TCR ) -mediated ' activation of T cells induces the transcription and synthesis of the cell surface molecule Fas and its ligand , FasL ( 1 ) .
Although activated T cells are initially resistant to death signals mediated by Fas , prolonged activation increases their sensitivity , presumably owing to down-regulation of such cellular inhibitors of the Fas/FADD/caspase 8 cascade as c-FLIPs ( 2 ) and IAPs ( 8 , 4 ) .
The murine Ipr and gid mutations result in the loss of function of Fas ( 5 ) and FasL ( 6-8 ) , respectively .
As a result , these mice lack a functional Fas death pathway , preventing deletion of activated T cells and * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

Humans with defects in Fas-mediated killing have an lpr-like syndrome , with accumulation of DN ( TCR*CD4~CD8~ ) T lymphocytes and autoimmune phenomena ( 9-11 ) .
MRL ( Ipr ) and C3H-glid/gld ( gld ) cells have many features characteristic of activated T cells , and their presence is associated with the development of autoim-munity .
As a presumed consequence of being chronically acti-vated , Ipr and gld lymph node cells constitutively express high levels of fasL mRNA ( 12 , 13 ) .
Control of fasL transcription in different settings has been attributed to several transcription factors .
For example , fasL can be induced by DNA-damaging agents such as UV irradiation or topoisomerase inhibitors ( 14 ) .
In this case , mutant reporter constructs have indicated that control of fasL transcription can be attributed directly to NF- « B- and AP-l-binding sites located more than 1 kilobase upstream of the coding region .
Overexpression of a dominant negative form of the NF- « B inhibitor I- « B blocked the induction of the fasL-dependent reporter by these treatments .
Some correlative evidence has suggested that NF- « B also has a role in TCR-induced fasL expression .
For example , NF- « B activity , which is increased by proteasome-mediated degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitor I- « B ( 15 ) , and fasL expression are both blocked by proteasome inhibitors ( 16 ) .
Furthermore , induction of both NF- « B transcriptional activity and fasL transcription by TCR signals is sensitive to antioxidants , and pro-oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide can induce both ( 17 , 18 ) .
Both activation- and perox-ide-induced apoptosis were inhibited by overexpression of dominant negative I-xB ( 18 ) .
However , the NF- « B site that apparently takes part in stress-induced faosL up-regulation lies outside of the region that confers TCR inducibility of fasL transcription , and a potential NF- « B site that does lie in this region ( 19 ) is dispensable for TCR-mediated fasL up-regulation ( 20-22 ) .
There are a number of lines of evidence to suggest that NF-AT plays a critical role in fasL up-regulation .
First , fasL induction by TCR-mediated stimulation is sensitive to cyclosporin A ( CsA ) ( 23 , 24 ) .
Furthermore , anti-TCR-induced up-regulation of fasL in vivo is impaired in NF-ATp knockout mice ( 25 ) .
Footprinting analysis of the fasL promoter with the use of recombinant proteins identified two potential NF-AT-binding sites ( 22 ) .
The distal site , located at -275 relative to the coding region , was found to contribute to fasL reporter activity in Jurkat cells ( 22 , 26 ) .
In contrast , we found that mutation or deletion of the NF-AT site at -275 did not have a substantial effect on fasL up-regulation and described a fasL regulatory element ( FLRE ] located from -214 to -207 in the fasL promoter ( 20 ) .
The FLRE conferred the majority of TCR-inducible fasL promoter activity in a murine T cell hybridoma and in human T cell blasts and proved to be a binding site for Egr-1 and Egr-3 , members of the Egr ( early growth response ) family This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog Role of Egr-2 in Up-regulation of Fas Ligand of transcription factors .
Overexpression of Egr-3 but not Egr-1 was sufficient to induce an FLRE-dependent reporter construct as well as an increase in cellular fasL mRNA .
TCR-mediated induction of Egr-3 but not Egr-1 was sensitive to inhibition by CsA , suggesting that Egr-3 may be a transcriptional target of NF-AT .
These data indicated that Egr-3 rather than the more abundant Egr-1 is likely to be a direct mediator of fasL transcription in activated T cells .
Transcription of Egr family genes is up-regulated after TCR activation ( 27 , 28 ) .
These Zn** finger-containing proteins have similar DNA-binding domains and similar DNA sequence preference ( 29 ) .
Other domains of the proteins differ , and the expression of Egr family genes can be differentially regulated , suggesting that individual members fulfill nonredundant biological roles ( 30 ) .
In this report we examine MRL and C3H-gld/gld DN T cells for the presence of FLRE-binding proteins that might contribute to the constitutive activation of the fasL promoter .
The results indicate that Egr-2 , like Egr-3 , can directly mediate TCR-induced transcription of fasL , and it is this member of the Egr family that appears to be responsible for the aberrant up-regulation of this gene in lpr and gld mice .

RESULTS lpr and gid Lymph Node T Cells Contain Elevated Levels of the FLRE-binding Proteins Egr-1 and Egr-2-Mice of the CBH-gid /gld ( gld ) and MRL-Ipr/lpr ( Ipr ) background acquire massive numbers of CD4 ~CD8~ T cells that bear characteristics indicative of chronic activation and express constitutively elevated levels of fasL mRNA ( 12 , 13 ) .
Because we have recently found that the fasL promoter is under the direct control of the activation-inducible and CsA-sensitive transcription factor Egr-3 ( 20 ) , we asked whether T cells from lpr and gld mice contain elevated levels of FLRE-binding proteins .
Extracts derived from freshly isolated lymph nodes from 3-5-month-old lpr and gld mice , which consist almost entirely of DN T cells ( Ref .
37 and data not shown ) , were examined by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( gel shift ) .
Incubating extracts from either mouse with the labeled FLRE revealed a major retarded species ( Fig .
1 , bands I and IT ) .
The center of migration of this band was slightly faster than that of a band previously identified as Egr-1 in activated 2B4.11 T hybridoma cells ( Fig .
1 , stimulated 2B4.11 cells ) and corresponded to the migration of Egr-1 and Egr-2 generated by transient expression in HeLa cells ( data not shown ) .
Addition of a nonspecific antiserum or an antiserum specific for the distantly related Egr family member WT-1 , the product of the Wilms ' tumor suppressor gene locus , did not affect the gel shift patterns .
In contrast , antisera specific for Egr-1 caused a reduction in the intensity of the major shifted band I , and the remaining material ( band II ) migrated slightly more rapidly than the mean of bands I and II .
The anti-Egr-1 antibodies also caused the appearance of supershifted anti-body-antigen-DNA complexes of slower mobility .
Antibodies against Egr-2 also reduced the intensity of the principal band ; in this case the remaining material ( band I ) migrated more 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 3224 gld Role of Egr-2 in Up-regulation of Fas Ligand Stimulated Ipr 2B4.11 Antisera added : Egr-3 Wit » Egr-1 & -2 None - Egr-1 Ub Egr-2 WT NS i= t , , WW i= tw = Wit W rv - t las lat tas tant bath tat Ul Egr-1 & -2 None Egr-1 © Egr-2 Egr-3 U Egr-1 & -2 WT NS None UB Egr-1 & -3 J mat tat wat was tat tas wis Sth linus ( s Fig .

Analysis of FLRE-binding proteins in Ipr and gld DN T cell extracts .
Extracts of freshly isolated and untreated lpr and gld lymph node DN T cells or 2B4.11 cells stimulated for 3 h with PMA ( 10 ng/m ! )
and ionomycin ( 1 ug/ml ) were incubated with the end-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the region from -220 to -205 ( 16-mer ) of the fasL promoter .
Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels .
Antisera raised against the indicated molecules were added during the incubation .
Bands corresponding to Egr-1 ( band D ) , Egr-2 ( band II ) , Egr-3 ( band III ) , and a nonspecific ( NS ) band ( band IV ) are indicated .
The mobility of these species correlated with that of the homologous rat proteins expressed in Hela cells by transient transfection ( data not shown ) .
WT , Wilms ' tumor antigen WT-L. slowly than the combined bands I and II .
Anti-Egr-2 caused the appearance of a supershifted complex of mobility different from that of the Egr-1 supershifted complex .
Simultaneous addition of both Egr-1 and Egr-2-specific antisera caused the complete disappearance of the major retarded species .
Only a very small amount of material migrated more rapidly than band II , and , unlike activated 2B4.11 cells ( Fig .
1 and Ref .
20 ) , antisera against Egr-3 had little effect on this band III in lpr and gld cell extracts .
Finally , as with 2B4.11 cells , band IV is constitutively present and is not eliminated by the unlabeled FLRE oligonucleotide ( 20 ) .
Therefore , unstimulated DN T cells from both lpr and gld mice have little if any Egr-3 but , unlike normal unac-tivated T cells ( 20 ) , constitutively express Egr-1 and Egr-2 , as evidenced by binding to the FLRE .
The expression of the different Egr family transcription factors in DN T cells was further analyzed by Northern blot analysis .
RNA from freshly isolated lpr and gld DN T cells had elevated levels of egr-1 and egr-2 when compared with unacti-vated normal C3H T cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
In contrast , the level of egr-3 in DN T cells was , although slightly higher than that in unstimulated normal T cells , substantially lower than that in activated normal T cells .
These data demonstrate that lpr and gld lymph node DN T cells have an activated phenotype with regard to Egr family protein expression , with constitutively high levels of Egr-1 and Egr-2 and relatively little Eigr-3 .
Egr-2 Is Among the Induced FLRE-binding Proteins in Activated 2B4.11 and Normal T Cells-The expression of Egr-2 in a T hybridoma cell line and normal T cells was examined .
Egr-2 , whose migration is only slightly faster than Egr-1 , was not previously recognized by gel shift analysis in extracts of activated 2B4.11 T hybridoma cells , and no supershifted material was detected with a commercially available putative anti-Egr-2 polyclonal antiserum ( 20 ) .
Reexamination of cell extracts from activated 2B4.11 cells revealed , however , that supershifting with anti-Egr-1 and anti-Egr-3 antibodies left a faint band that migrated slightly faster than the bulk of the Egr-1 material and co-migrated with recombinant Egr-2 ( Fig .
1 and data not shown ) .
Furthermore , addition of a different anti-Egr-2 antiserum , which we have found supershifts recombinant Egr-2 ( data not shown ) removed this band entirely ( Fig .
1 ) , indicating that the FLRE binding activity in activated 2B4.11 cells consists of Egr-1 , Egr-2 , and Egr-3 .
To determine what FLRE-binding proteins are induced in normal T cells , C3H lymph node cells were studied .
Small amounts of shifted material in the region corresponding to bands I , II , and III could be seen in untreated lymph node cells ( Fig .
3 ) .

Egr-2 mRNA induction in activated normal T cells is sensitive to CsA .
Total RNA from ( C57BI/6 X DBA2Z ) F , mice either unstimulated or stimulated for 3 h with PMA and ionomycin in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml CsA was subjected to Northern blot analysis for egr-2 mRNA expression .
PMA and ionomycin .
caused the appearance of a correspondingly smaller amount of supershifted material .
The combination of the two antisera completely removed bands I and II .
As with 2B4.11 cells , an antiserum against Egr-3 specifically removed band III .
Consistent with the gel shift data , Northern blot analysis demonstrated that mRNA for all three Egr family members was induced by activation ( Fig .
2 ) .
Therefore , in normal lymph node T cells , activation induces the appearance of Egr-1 , -2 , and -3 .
TCR-mediated Egr-2 Induction Is Sensitive to CsA-TCR-mediated induction of FasL expression is inhibited by CsA , which blocks activation of the NF-AT transcription factor as a consequence of inhibiting the phosphatase calcineurin ( 38 , 39 ) .
Similarly , activation-induced activity of the FLRE reporter and induction of Egr-3 , but not Egr-1 , are sensitive to CsA ( 20 ) .
The issue of whether induced Egr-2 expression is sensitive to inhibition by CsA is controversial .
In one study with peripheral blood cells ( 28 ) , CsA was found to have a relatively small effect on egr-2 induction , whereas in another study on a thymocyte cell line , CsA was found to inhibit activation-induced egr-2 ( 40 ) .
To determine whether Egr-2 induction in normal murine T cells is CsA-sensitive , normal lymph node cells were activated by PMA plus ionomycin in the presence or absence of CsA ( Fig .
4 ) .
Egr-2 mRNA levels were substantially increased by activa-tion , a response that was inhibited by CsA .
Thus , in normal T cells Egr-2 , like Egr-3 ( 20 ) , is a CsA-sensitive T cell activation-inducible transcription factor .
Egr-2 Expression Is Sufficient to Induce fasL Transcription-Egr family transcription factors contain no known dimerization domains , and their genetic target sites are asymmetrical .
Therefore , they are thought to bind to DNA and activate transcription as monomers .
In addition , their transcriptional activity is not thought to depend on post-translational modification ( 41 ) .
Accordingly , transient overexpression of Egr-3 was previously found to be sufficient for induction of a fasL promoter reporter plasmid in the absence of any TCR-mediated activation ( 20 ) .
Egr-2 was likewise tested for its ability to independently induce fasL-specific transcription .
2B4.11 cells were transfected with a reporter construct encoding the luciferase gene driven by a minimal fasL promoter to which was appended the region from -220 to -205 , which contains the FLRE .
Enforced expression of Egr-1 had little effect on the activity of the intact reporter ( Fig .
5A ) .
As previously shown ( 20 ) , the Egr-3 expression plasmid induced significantly higher activity .
Overexpression of Egr-2 resulted in a response that was similar to that induced by Egr-3 .
Cotransfection of plasmids encoding the Egr family gene products had little effect on the activity of a reporter construct with a mutation in the FLRE that eliminated TCR-induced activity of fasL reporter constructs ( 20 ) .
To determine whether Egr-2 activates the FLRE in a nonlymphoid cell , the effect of its overexpression was tested in HeLa cells .
As with the 2B4.11 cells , the mutated reporter was only minimally affected by cotransfected Egr-expressing plasmids .

Induction of fasL-dependent transcription by transient overexpression of Egr family members .
A , 2B4.11 or Helia cells were transfected with the indicated Egr family expression plasmids and luciferase reporter plasmids that were dependent on either a wild type or a mutated FLRE , and luciferase activity was measured 14 h ( 2B4.11 ) or 32 h ( HeLa ) later .
Results are expressed as fold inductions by Egr protein-expressing plasmids relative to the empty parental plasmid .
The data represent the geometric means of three independent experiments for each cell type .
B , Hela cells were transiently transfected with Egr family expression plasmids , and the relative levels of human fasL mRNA were determined by RT-PCR and Southern blotting 82 h later .
The lane labeled -RT contains the PCR products of a mock reverse transcriptase reaction with the Egr-3-transfected RNA sample from which reverse transcriptase was omitted .
One representative experiment of five is shown .
the wild type FLRE was minimally affected by cotransfected Egr-1 , it was driven by Egr-3 and even more strongly by Eigr-2 .
Thus , expression of either Egr-2 or Egr-3 is sufficient to induce the fasL promoter , and this response does not require the presence of lymphoid-specific accessory factors .
We previously showed that overexpression of Egr-3 is sufficient to induce the appearance of fasL mRNA in Hela cells .
Similar experiments were performed to determine whether the same is true for Egr-2 ( Fig .
5B ) .
Expression of Egr-1 had only a small effect on fasL mRNA levels as measured by RT-PCR .

An intact FLRE is required for optimal constitutive fasL-dependent reporter activity in lpr lymph node DN T cells .

mRNA .
Thus , Egr-2 can activate fasL-specific transcription without other methods of cellular activation .
Mutation of the FLRE Diminishes Expression of fas Reporters in Ipr and gld DN T Cells-To determine whether the FLRE and by implication Egr-2 are necessary for the up-regulation of FasL in lpr and gld DN T cells , these cells were transiently transfected with reporter constructs driven by parts of the fasL promoter ( Fig .
6 ) .
A reporter containing the proximal 225 bp of the fasL gene was induced to a much greater extent than one containing just the proximal 212 bp ( and thus having a disrupted Egr-binding site ( -214 to -207 ) ) .
Moreover , a reporter driven by a larger segment of the promoter ( 305 bp ) also was active in these cells , and this activity was largely lost by mutation of the FLRE .
Similar results were obtained with gld DN T cells ( data not shown ) .
These results support the notion that the FLRE , principally by binding the constitutively present transcription factor Egr-2 , plays a major role in the maintenance of fasL mRNA expression in both lpr and gld DN T cells and in an additional context confirm the role of this site in fasL regulation in T cells .
DISCUSSION The importance of the FasL-triggered apoptotic death pathway for T cell homeostasis is well established .
The regulation of fasL transcription is a critical control point in this phenome-non .
A single Egr family binding element appears to account for the majority of the activation-induced cis-acting regulation of fasL ( 20 ) .
In this report we identify Egr-2 , along with the previously identified Egr-3 , as a direct regulator of fasL transcription in activated T cells .
Like Egr-3 , this factor inducibly binds to the FLRE in the fasL promoter and is synthesized de novo in a CsA-sensitive manner upon T cell activation .
Ectopi-cally expressed Egr-2 , like Egr-3 , was sufficient to induce fasL-specific transcription , as indicated by both fasL reporter construct activity and the measurement of cellular fasL mRNA .
Egr family genes are transcriptionally up-regulated from low basal levels in response to a multitude of cellular stimuli ( 41 ) .
TCR induction of Egr family gene transcription is differentially sensitive to CsA ; transcription of Egr-2 and Egr-3 is sensitive to CsA , but Egr-1 is not .
That the more abundant Egr-1 protein does not up-regulate fasL was confirmed by transient expression in T and HeLa cells , in which it was found to be ineffective at inducing fasL reporter constructs and fasL mRNA expression .
Thus , by these criteria Egr-2 and Egr-3 are the likely Egr family members to mediate transcriptional activation through the FLRE and thus are likely themselves to be regulated by NF-AT .
Little is known about the function of Egr-2 in vivo .
As with the other Egr family members , egr-2 mRNA is not detected in Role of Egr-2 in Up-regulation of Fas Ligand most adult tissues by Northern analysis .
An exception is the thymus , where some of the cells are undergoing antigen-driven selection ( 42 ) , and activated T cells ( 28 , 40 ) .
Egr-2 is also expressed in the course of embryogenesis ( days 8-9 postcoitum in the mouse ) in rhombomeres r3 and r5 of the hindbrain .
Egr-2-deficient mice have disruptions of these rhombomeres ( 43 ) as well as defects in myelination of peripheral nerves ( 30 ) , and the mice are nonviable .
Proposed target genes of Egr-2 include HoxB-2 and HoxA-2 ( 44 ) , which encode homeobox domain transcription factors ( 45 ) , and EphA4 , which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase ( 46 ) .
Treatment of mouse embryos with retinoic acid , which activates retinoic acid receptors ( RARs/RXRs ) that are themselves transcription factors , inhibits egr-2 expression in rhombomere 3 and prevents maturation of this hindbrain segment ( 47-49 ) .
Interestingly , in T cells and thymocytes , retinoic acid inhibits activation-induced fasL up-regulation and apoptosis ( 50-52 ) .
The mechanism by which retinoic acid inhibits TCR-inducible fasL promoter activity remains to be determined .
Thus , some of the genetic interrelationships that underlie neural development may be recapitulated in that of the immune system .
The aberrant DN T cells found in lpr and gld mice have an activated phenotype yet are refractory to stimuli such as TCR cross-linking , interleukin-2 , CD28 , PMA , and phytohemagglu-tinin ( 53 ) .
The activated state presumably arises from continual contact with self-antigens because of the inability of the peripheral T cells to be deleted by the normal Fas-dependent mechanisms .
DN T cells spontaneously turn over inositol phosphates ( 54 ) , display elevated tyrosine-phosphorylation of TCRE ( 55 ) and Vav ( 56 ) , and express increased levels of the tyrosine kinase Fyn ( 57 ) .
Also increased is the DNA binding activity of the transcription factors NF-kB , AP-1 , and an uncharacterized DNA binding activity , NF-AT , , that recognized the DNA sequence of the interleukin-2 promoter NF-AT site ( 58 ) .
DN T cells do not proliferate upon TCR cross-linking in part because they are unable to up-regulate production of interleukin-2 ( 59 ) .
To account for this , it was proposed that NFAT , functions as a transcriptional repressor that overrides the activating potential of the aforementioned constitutive transcription factors activity , although no such repressive activity was demonstrated ( 58 ) .
It is possible that in the context of the egr-2 and egr-3 promoters NF-AT , , functions as an activator of transcription .
Attempts to analyze the promoters of these genes are currently underway .
By Northern analysis , Ipr and gld DN T cells were found to contain elevated egr-2 mRNA levels relative to activated C3H normal T cells .
mRNA for egr-3 , and to a lesser extent egr-1 , was less abundant in DN T cells than in activated normal T cells .
These relative levels correlated with those observed by gel shift .
On the other hand , activated 2B4.11 cells contained similar amounts of Egr-2- and Egr-3-specific FLRE binding activity .
Thus , of the Egr family members capable of inducing fasL transcription , Egr-2 is selectively expressed in lpr and gld DN T cells .
Differential regulation of Egr family member expression is thus another characteristic distinguishing the chronic state of activation of lpr and gld DN T cells from that of normal T cells responding acutely to antigen .
Analysis of the correlation between the signaling pathways constitutively activated and the Egr family members expressed in DN T cells will further understanding of both normal and abnormal TCR signaling .
