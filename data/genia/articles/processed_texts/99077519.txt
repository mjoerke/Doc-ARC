6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Role of Stat4 in Species-Specific Regulation of Th Cell Development by Type I IFNs Lars Rogge , `` * Daniele D'Ambrosio , * Mauro Biffi , * Giuseppe Penna , * Lisa J. Minetti , ' David H. Presky , `` Luciano Adorini , *® and Francesco Sinigaglia* Type I IFNs ( IFN- « /f ) , in addition to IL-12 , have been shown to play an important role in the differentiation of human , but not mouse , Th cells .
We show here that IFN- @ w/ $ B act directly on human T cells to drive Th1 development , bypassing the need for IL-12-induced signaling , whereas can not substitute IL-12 for mouse Th1 development .
The molecular basis for this species specificity is that IFN- @ /B activate Statd4 in differentiating human , but not mouse , Th cells .
Unlike IL-12 , which acts only on Th1 cells , IFN- @ « /B can activate Statd4 not only in human Th1 , but also in Th2 cells .
However , restimulation of human Th2 lines and clones in the presence of IFN-a @ does not induce the production of IFN-y .
These results suggest that activation of Stat4 , which is necessary for the differentiation of naive T cells into polarized Th1 cells , is not sufficient to induce phenotype reversal of human Th2 cells .
differ in their cytokine secretion pattern and effector func- tions has provided a basis for the diversity of T cell-de-pendent immune responses ( 1 ) .
The two subsets of differentiated CD4* T cells , referred to as Thl1 and Th2 cells , protect against different microbial pathogens by producing cytokines able to mobilize different mechanisms of defense .
Th1 cells secrete IFN-y and TNF- $ and are the mediators of phagocyte-dependent immune reactions , whereas Th2 cells that secrete IL-4 and IL-5 are responsible for phagocyte-independent host defense ( 2 ) .
Uncontrolled Th1 and Th2 responses can cause chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases and allergies , respectively ( 3 ) .
Th1 and Th2 cells develop from naive CD4* T cells .
The differentiation process is initiated by ligation of the TCR and directed by cytokines present during the initiation of a T cell response ( 4 ) .
IL-4 promotes Th2 development ( 5-7 ) , whereas IL-12 is a potent inducer of Th1 cells ( 8-11 ) .
IL-4 activates Stat6 in Th2 cells ( 12 , 13 ) , and IL-12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Statd4 in developing and differentiated Th1 cells ( 14-19 ) .
The activation of these two STAT factors is essential for T cell subset development , since Stat6-deficient T lymphocytes fail to differentiate into Th2 cells in response to IL-4 ( 20-22 ) , and the analysis of Stat4 ' -deficient mice revealed that Statd4 is essential for Th1 cell differentiation ( 23 , 24 ) .
Regulation of the IL-12 signaling pathway is crucial for the development of Th cells .
The subunit , a ligand-binding and signal-transducing component of the IL-12R ( 25 ) , is expressed on human Th1 , but not Th2 , cells ( 18 , 19 ) .
Triggering of the Ag receptor on naive T cells is sufficient for the initial expression of functional IL-12Rs , which are quickly lost during differentiation of human and mouse cells along the Th2 pathway ( 18 , 19 ) .
In addition to TCR-mediated regulation , the IL-12RfB2 subunit can be up-regulated by IL-12 ( 19 ) .

IFNs have also been shown to play an important role in Th1 cell development .
Recently , we have shown that human cord blood leukocytes primed in the presence of IFN- « , but not IFN-y , develop into IFN-y-producing Th1 cells even when cultured in the presence of IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 Abs .
The Th1 cells generated in this manner express the mRNA and are responsive to IL-12 ( 19 ) .
In contrast to human cells , IFN- @ /B are unable to induce Th1 development and prime mouse T cells to respond to IL-12 ( 26 ) .
In the present study we investigated the molecular basis for the species-specific effect of IFN- @ /B on the selective induction of Th1-type immune responses .
Our results indicate that IFN- @ / $ B , by phosphorylating Statd4 in human , but not in mouse , T cells , promote species-specific induction of Th1-type immune responses .
Furthermore , since T cell responsiveness to IFN-a is not lost during Th2 differentiation , we explored the effect of IFN-a-induced Stat4 activation on the phenotype of fully differentiated Th2 cells .
Materials and Methods Generation of Th1 and Th2 lines from cord blood leukocytes Human neonatal leukocytes were isolated from freshly collected , heparin-ized , neonatal blood by Ficoll-Paque ( Pharmacia Biotech , Uppsala , Swe-den ) density gradient centrifugation .
Monocytes were removed by one round of plastic adherence , and CD4* T cells were isolated by negative selection with an Ab mixture and magnetic activated cell sorting , according to a protocol supplied by the manufacturer ( CD4* T cell isolation kit , Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) .
Neonatal T cell preparations were > 97 % CD45 RA* and > 99 % CD4* .
Th1 and Th2 cell lines were generated by stimulating neonatal CD4* T cells with irradiated ( 6000 rad ) , autologous monocytes and 2 pg/ml PHA ( Wellcome , Beckenham , U.K. ) in the presence of 2.5 ng/ml IL-12 ( Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley , NJ ) and 200 ng/ml neutralizing anti-IL-4 Abs ( 18500D , PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) for Th1 cultures , or 1 ng/ml IL-4 ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) and 2 pg/ml neutralizing anti-IL-12 Abs 17F7 and 20C2 ( provided by M. Gately , Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley , NJ ) for Th2 cultures , respectively .
To test the effect of IFNs on Th cell development , 1000 U/ml of IFN- « ( Ro-feron A , Hoffmann-La Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , IFN-y ( Hoffmann-La Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , or IFN-B ( Frone , Ares Serono , Geneva , Swit-zerland ) was added at the time of priming to cultures containing IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 Abs ( Th2-inducing conditions ) .
Cells were washed on day 4 and expanded in complete RPMI 1640 medium ( Life Technolo-gies , Milan , Italy ) supplemented with 5 % FetalClone I ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin containing 100 U/ml IL-2 ( Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley , NJ ) .

Monocytes were depleted by two rounds of plastic adherence , and B cells were depleted by adherence to nylon wool as previously described ( 27 ) .
CD45RA * T cells were isolated by two rounds of immunomagnetic negative selection with a mixture of mAbs as described previously ( 28 ) .
The purity of the CD3/CD45RA* T cells using this procedure was typically > 98 % as determined by flow cytometry .
Purified CD4SRA * T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb ( TR66 ) ( 29 ) in the presence of IL-12 ( 2.5 ng/m ! )
and neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb ( 200 ng/ml ) , or IL-4 ( 1 ng/m ! )
for the generation of Th1 and Th2 lines , respectively .
To test whether IFNs exert their functional effects directly on T cells , IFN-a , IFN- , or IFN-y ( 1000 U/ml ) was added at the time of stimulation to cultures containing IL-4 ( 1 ng/ml ) .
Cells were washed on day 3 and expanded in complete medium containing 100 U/ml IL-2 .
T cell clones T cell clones GL93 and D4.11 have been described previously ( 30 , 31 ) .
Briefly , Lol pl-specific T cell clones were generated from PBMC of two Lol p1 allergic subjects as previously described ( 32 ) .
The three Lol p1-specific T cell clones that we selected for this study had a polarized cytokine profile .
Two ( D4.11 and E4.1 ) produced IL-4 but not IFN-y and were categorized as Th2 clones , and one ( ET3.22 ) that was able to produce IFN-y but not IL-4 was categorized as a Th1 clone .
Th1 clone GL93 is specific for the hepatitis virus 8 Ag and has been described previously ( 30 ) .
To analyze cytokine production , 105/0.2 ml T cells were stimulated with a combination of anti-CD3 mAb ( 0.1 pg/ml ; CLB-T3/4E , CLB , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) and anti-CD28 mAb ( 1 ug/ml ; PharMingen ) in the presence or the absence of IL-12 ( 2.5 ng/m ! )

Brefeldin A ( 10 ug/ml ; Sigma ) was added to the cultures , and the cultures were incubated for an additional 2 h. Then the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with saponin .
Fixed cells were stained with anti-human IFN-y-FITC ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) and anti-human IL-4-PE ( PharMingen ) following a protocol provided by the manufacturer and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .

, manuscript in preparation ) .
Splenocytes from the immunized rat were isolated and fused to the SP2/0 mouse myeloma cell line , and Ab-producing hybridomas were produced by standard methods ( 34 ) .
Hybridoma supernatants were screened by flow cytometry using a human IL-12Rf2-ex-pressing Ba/F3 cell line ( 25 ) , and the mAb 2B6 bound to the human IL-12RB2-expressing transfectants , but not the parental Ba/F3 cell line .

Following transfer to nitrocellulose , blots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab 4G10 ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) , and immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL Western blotting system ( Amersham , Italy ) , according to the company 's protocols .
To control for equal protein loading , blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-Stat4 antisera .
Generation of mouse Thl1 and Th2 lines from DO.11.10-transgenic CD4* T cell cultures Mel-14 `` ® `` CD4* T cells were purified from spleen and lymph nodes of DO11.10 TCR-transgenic mice ( 37 ) by positive selection using anti-CD4~FITC ( PharMingen ) and an anti-FITC multisort kit ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) followed by positive selection of Mel-14 `` * `` cells using anti-CD62L microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) .
Naive CD4 * T cells ( 2.5 X 10° cells/well ) were stimulated with 0.3 uM OVA peptide 323-339 and mitomycin C-treated BALB/c splenocytes ( 5 X 10° cells/well ) as APC in a total volume of 2 ml in 24-well plates in the presence of 100 pg/ml IL-12 ( provided by M. Gately , Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley , NJ ) and 10 ug/tol anti-IL-4 mAb ( 11B11 ) to promote Th1 phenotype development or in the presence of 20 ng/ml IL-4 and 10 ug/ml anti-IL-12 mAb 10F6 ( provided by M. Gately , Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley , NJ ) to promote Th2 phenotype development as described previously ( 16 , 38 ) .
Cells were expanded in complete medium supplemented with recombinant human IL-2 ( 10 ng/ml ; provided by M. Gately , Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley , NJ ) and harvested on day 5 or 7 .
The Th phenotype was determined by intracellular staining for IFN-y and IL-4 production after restimulation with PMA/iono-mycin as described previously ( 38 ) .
Analysis of IL-12RB2 transcripts in mouse Th cells RNase protection assays to analyze IL-12R 32 transcripts in mouse Th cells were performed as previously described ( 39 ) .
Briefly , a 332-bp Sacl DNA fragment from the mouse IL-12RB2 subunit ( 25 ) was subcloned into pSPUTK ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
The construct was linearized with EcoRI , and radiolabeled antisense transcripts were synthesized with SP6 polymerase and a commercial kit , according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
RNA was extracted from cells using Ultraspec total RNA extraction reagent ( Biotec , Houston , TX ) as previously described ( 40 ) .
The antisense RNA probes were hybridized to 10 ug of total RNA , and RNase protection assays were performed with a commercial kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) , according to the company 's protocol .
Products were resolved on 6 % denaturing polyacrylamide gels , and the protected fragments were visualized by autoradiography .
The radioactivity present in the protected fragments was also quantitated using a MolecularImager ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) .
An 188 RNA probe was used as a control for equal RNA loading .
Expression of MHC class I molecules in mouse Th1 and Th2 cells Mouse Th1 and Th2 lines generated from DO.11.10-transgenic CD4* T cell cultures were harvested 5 days after stimulation and incubated for 3 days with or without IFN- ( 1000 U/ml ) .

Results IFN- @ /B act directly on human T cells to promote Thl development To examine the roles of IFN-a , IFN- $ B , and IFN-y in the differentiation of human Th cell subsets , we generated T cell lines from CD4* , CD45RA * T cells isolated from cord blood .
Naive T cells were stimulated with irradiated allogeneic monocytes and PHA in 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology 6569 FIGURE 1 .
Functional effects of IFN- , IFN- , and IFN-y on human Th cell differentiation .
Neonatal CD4* T cells were stimulated with PHA and irradi-ated , allogeneic monocytes in the presence of the following cytokines and anti-cytokine mAbs : A , IL-12 and anti-IL-4 ; B , IL-4 and anti-IL-12 ; C , IL-4 , anti-IL-12 , and IFN- ; D , IL-4 , anti-IL-12 , and IFN- ; £ , IL-4 , anti-IL-12 , and IFN-y .
Seven days after stimulation , the cells were harvested , and the intracellular production of IL-4 and IFN-y was analyzed by flow cytometry .
IL-4 the presence of IL-12 and neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb or IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAb , respectively .
IFN- « , IFN-B , or IFN-y were added at the time of priming to cultures containing IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAbs ( Th2-inducing conditions ) .
The Th phenotype was determined 7 days after stimulation .
After restimulation with PMA and ionomycin , IFN-y and IL-4 productions were determined at the single cell level by intracellular staining ( Fig .
1 ) .
Neonatal T cells primed in the presence of IL-12 and neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAbs developed mostly into Th1 cells ( 55 % IFN-y-producing cells vs 4 % IL-4 producers and 8 % double pro-ducers ; Fig .
14 ) , whereas priming in the presence of IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAbs induced development of a polarized Th2 population ( 0.5 % IFN-y-producing cells vs 23 % IL-4 produc-ers ; Fig .
1B ) .
Addition of IFN-a ( Fig .
1C ) or IFN-B ( Fig .
1D ) at the time of priming under Th2-inducing conditions ( IL-4 and anti-IL-12 mAbs ) resulted in a marked increase in cells producing IFN-y ( 11 and 20 % compared with 0.5 % ) and a reduction ( two- to fourfold ) in cells producing IL-4 ( 12 and 5 % compared with 23 % ) .
IFN-y , in contrast , was less effective in inducing Th1 cell development ( Fig .
1€ ) : only a marginal increase in cells producing IFN-y ( 2.9 % compared with 0.5 % ) and a minor decrease in IL-4-producing cells ( 20 % compared with 23 % ) were observed in cultures that had been stimulated in the presence of IL-4 , neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAbs , and IFN-y .
Priming in the presence of IFN- « , neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb , and anti-IL-12 mAb also resulted in the development of Th1 cells , indicating that IFN-a @ is directly implicated in Th1 development rather than through the action of IL-4 ( data not shown ) .
These results confirm and extend our previous finding that cord blood leukocytes primed with PHA in the presence of IL-4 , anti-IL-12 mAbs , and IFN-a secrete predominantly IFN-y upon restimulation ( 19 ) .
We next analyzed whether IFN- @ /B promote Th1 development by acting directly on naive T cells or whether the presence of APC is required .
Purified CD45RA * T cells isolated from peripheral blood were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb in the presence of IL-12 and neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb to induce Th1 development or in the presence of IL-4 to promote Th2 development , respectively .
IFN- , IFN- $ B , or IFN-y was added at the time of CD3 stimulation to cultures containing IL-4 .
After 3 days of cul-ture , the cells were washed and expanded for an additional 6 days in medium containing IL-2 .
The IL-12 responsiveness of the cell lines was used as a readout to determine the Th phenotype .
As expected , IL-12 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 in cultures that have been stimulated in the presence of IL-12 ( Fig .
24 , lane 2 ) , whereas it was unable to activate this signaling pathway in cultures that had been primed in the presence of IL-4 ( lane 4 ) .
Moreover , addition of IFN-a @ or IFN- at priming even in the presence of the Th2-inducing cytokine IL-4 resulted in the development of IL-12-responsive T cells ( lanes 6 and 8 ) , whereas IFN-y did not significantly increase IL-12 responsiveness under these conditions ( Zane 10 ) .
In addition , IL-12 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 in cultures that had been stimulated in the presence of IFN- and neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb ( data not shown ) .
The ability of cells primed in the presence of IFN-w/B to signal in response to IL-12 correlates with IL-12RB2 expression .
Surface IL-12R expression was monitored using mAbs directed against the B1 and B2 subunits of the IL-12R .
Fig .
2B shows that while IL-12RB1 was expressed to the same extent regardless of the cytokines present at priming , IL-12RB2 was selectively expressed by T cells primed in the presence of IL-12 or IFN- « / $ .
In conclusion , these data indicate that in addition to IL-12 , IFN-a and IFN-B act directly on human T cells to promote the development of Th1-type cells .
IFN-a does not induce the development of mouse Th1 cells Wenner et al .
have shown that in contrast to human cells , IFN- @ /B could not induce Th1 development and IL-12 responsiveness in mouse T cells ( 26 ) .
IFN-y , however , induced IL-12-responsive mouse T cells by up-regulating the IL-12R $ B2 subunit ( 18 ) .
To address the apparent differences in IFN action in the two species , we compared side by side the functional effects of IFN- @ /B on human and mouse Th subset differentiation .
Mouse OVA-specific Th1 and Th2 lines were generated by stimulating purified naive CD4* T cells from DO11.10 TCR-transgenic mice specific for OVA peptide 323-339 with OVA peptide presented by mitomycin C-treated BALB/c splenocytes in the presence of IL-12 and neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb or IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAbs , respectively ( 16 , 38 ) .
At priming , IFN-a or IFN-y was added to cultures containing IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAbs .
The Th phenotype of these lines was analyzed by staining for intracellular cytokines after stimulation with PMA and ionomycin .
As expected , priming in the presence of IL-12 and neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb induced Th1 phenotype development , whereas priming in the 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 6570 A FIGURE 2 .

10° WII 162 presence of IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAbs promoted differentiation of Th2 cells ( data not shown ) .
Addition of IFN-a or IFN-y at priming to cultures containing IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAbs had no significant effect on the Th2 cytokine profile of the resulting population ( data not shown ) .
We next analyzed expression of the IL-12RB2 subunit and IL-12 responsiveness in these cells .
As Abs against the mouse IL-12RB1 and -B2 subunits are not yet available , transcripts encoding the IL-12Rf1 and -B2 subunits were analyzed by RNase protection assays .
Consistent with previous observations ( 18 , 39 ) , no significant differences in IL-12RB1 mRNA expression were detected in mouse Th cell lines ( data not shown ) .
Since IL-12 up-regulates the expression of IL-12RB2 transcripts in activated human and mouse T cells ( 19 , 39 ) , we used induction of IL-12RB2 mRNA by IL-12 as a readout for IL-12 responsiveness .
IL-12RB2 is expressed in mouse Th1 cells ( Fig .
3 , lane 1 ) and culturing Th1 cells for 20 h in the presence of IL-12 strongly up-regulates the expression of IL-1 2R $ 2 ( Jane 2 ) , indicating the presence of a functional IL-12R .
T cells primed under Th2-inducing conditions in the absence ( Jane 3 ) or the presence ( Zane 5 ) of IFN- « did not express IL-12RfB2 transcripts , and IL-12 treatment did not induce IL-12RB2 mRNA expression ( lanes 4 and 6 ) .
In contrast , priming in the presence of IFN-y resulted in the development of cells that express IL-12RB2 transcripts and are IL-12 responsive ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
These cells , when restimulated in the presence of IL-12 , secreted IFN-y ( data not shown ) .
The data obtained with mouse T cells diverge from the findings in the human system , where priming of naive T cells in the presence of IFN- @ /B results in the development of IFN-y-producing cells that express the IL-12R $ 2 subunit ( Figs .

Th1 and Th2 cells from DO11.10 TCR-transgenic CD4* T cells were treated for 3 days with or without IFN-a ( 1000 U/ml ) and stained with biotinylated anti-clonotype mAb KJ1.26 followed by streptavidin-FITC and anti-H-2K-phycoerythrin .

of Statd in response to IFNs and IL-12 in differentiating human and mouse Th1 and Th2 cells .
In agreement with our previous findings ( 19 ) and those of other laboratories ( 16-18 ) , IL-12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 in human Th1 , but not Th2 , cells ( Fig .
4A , lanes 2 and 7 ) .
Interestingly , IFN-a « and IFN- $ were very efficient in activating Stat4 in human Th1 cells , and unlike IL-12 , they also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 in Th2 lines 6571 ( lanes 3 , 4 , 8 , and 9 ) .
IFN-y , in contrast , did not induce activation of Stat4 in Th1 or Th2 cells ( lanes 5 and 10 ) .
We next examined whether IFN- induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 in mouse Th1 and Th2 cells .
DO11.10 Th1 and Th2 lines were exposed to IL-12 , IFN-a , or IFN-y .
As shown in Fig .
4B , Stat4 is activated by IL-12 in Th1 cells , but neither IFN-nor IFN-y induces Stat4 tyrosine phosphorylation in mouse Th1 or Th2 cells .
Notably , both cell types respond to IFN- by up-regulating class I molecules ( Fig .
4C ) , thus indicating that mouse T cells also express a functional IFN- « receptor .
These results provide clear evidence for a species-specific difference in IFN- « -in-duced activation of the Stat4 molecule .
Functional effects of STAT activation on cytokine production by differentiated human T cells The analysis of Stat4- and Staté-deficient mice has demonstrated the crucial role of STAT proteins in the initiation of transcription programs leading to the differentiation of naive T cells into polarized Th1 and Th2 subsets , respectively ( 20-24 ) .
An important question is whether activation of a specific STAT protein in differentiated Th1 and Th2 cells is sufficient to alter their cytokine secretion pattern .
Since IFN-a , in contrast to IL-12 , induces Stat4 phosphorylation in differentiating human Th1 and Th2 cells ( Fig .
44 ) as well as in established human Th1 and Th2 clones ( data not shown ) , we tested whether stimulation of Th2 lines and clones in the presence of IFN-a results in IFN-y production .
Restimulation of Th2 lines ( Fig .
54 ) and clones ( Fig .
5B ) in the presence of IFN-a @ resulted in only a modest increase in IFN-y production .
Consistent with a previous report , we detected high amounts of IFN-y in the culture supernatant after restimulation of Th2 cells in the presence of IL-12 ( 42 ) .
Thus , activation of Stat4 does not appear to be sufficient to induce IFN-y production by differentiated Th2 cells despite the fact that it has been shown to bind to a tandem site present in the first intron of the human IFN-y gene and thus has been implicated in the regulation of the IFN-y gene ( 43 ) .
Discussion Species-specific regulation of Th cell development by IFNs The functions of IFN- « @ /B and IFN-y in inducing differentiation of human and mouse naive T cells to Th1-type effector cells have remained controversial .
Stimulation of resting human T cells in the presence of IFN- « increases the frequency of IFN-y-secreting CD4* T cells ( 44 ) , and allergen-specific T cell clones generated in the presence of IFN-a « from the peripheral blood of atopic patients demonstrate a shift toward the ThO/1 phenotype ( 45 ) .
In addition , human cord blood leukocytes primed in the presence of IFN-a develop into IFN-y-producing Th1 cells , even when cultured in the presence of the Th2-inducing cytokine IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAbs .
The Th1 cells generated in this manner express the IL-12RB2 mRNA and are responsive to IL-12 ( 19 ) .
In contrast , IFN-y , but not IFN-a , has been shown to be an important cofactor for Th1 development in mice ( 26 , 46 , 47 ) .
IFN-y can rescue IL-12RB2 mRNA expression even in the presence of IL-4 and restore IL-12 responsiveness in early developing mouse Th2 cells ( 18 ) .
The data presented in this report provide a molecular basis for the previously described effect of IFN- @ /B in human Th1 development and help to explain the divergent function of type I IFNs when comparing human and mouse Th cell development .
Consistent with our previous observation ( 19 ) , IFN- @ /B induce Th1 development in human naive T cells , even in the presence of the Th2-inducing cytokine IL-4 ( Fig .
1 ) .

effect on T cells , as it occurs in the absence of APCs or exogenous factors other than IFN- @ / $ B .
Th1 cells generated by in the absence of IL-12 are comparable to IL-12-generated Th1 cells in terms of cytokine production , IL-12 responsiveness , and cell surface expression of the subunit .
Together , these findings provide clear evidence that human Th1-type immune responses can develop in the absence of IL-12 .
To analyze the functions of IFN- @ / $ B and IFN-y in mouse T cell differentiation , we generated mouse OVA-specific Th1 and Th2 cell lines from DO11.10 TCR-transgenic mice ( 16 , 37 ) .
Neither IFN-a nor IFN-y , when added at priming to cultures containing IL-4 and neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAbs , had a significant effect on the cytokine secretion profile of the resulting cell lines ( data not shown ) .
These data are in agreement with previous findings ( 18 , 26 ) .
Importantly , priming of naive T cells in the presence of IFN-y , but not IFN-a @ , results in the expression of IL-12RB2 transcripts .
These cells are IL-12 responsive , as demonstrated by IL-12-induced up-regulation of IL-12RB2 transcripts ( Fig .
3 ) and Stat4 phosphorylation ( data not shown ) .
STAT ACTIVATION IN DEVELOPING AND DIFFERENTIATED Th CELLS Restimulation of these cultures in the presence of IL-12 results in the production of IFN-y ( 18 ) ( data not shown ) .
These data suggest that IFN-y contributes to Thl development in mice , whereas IFN-a has no effect , unlike previous suggestions made from the analysis of transgenic mice expressing IFN- under the control of the rat insulin promoter ( 48 ) .
In conclusion , these data indicate that IFN- @ /B act directly on human , but not mouse , T cells to induce Th1 development , whereas IFN-y acts in both species in at least two ways ; on the one hand , IFN-y induces Th1 development by enhancing IL-12-production by human and mouse phagocytic cells ( 49 ) , and on the other hand , it up-regulates the expression of functional IL-12Rs on CD4 * T cells , rendering the cells more responsive to IL-12 ( 18 , 50 ) .
Our data indicate that the effect of IFN-y on the induction of IL-12 responsiveness is much stronger in mouse than in human T cells , as the expression of IL-12R $ 2 is up-regulated in response to IFN-y at much higher levels in mouse rather than in human T cells .
Together , these findings indicate that in mice IFN-y provides a signal for initiating Th1 development , the full progression of which requires IL-12-induced signaling .
On the contrary , IFN- @ /B are able to induce Th1 development in the absence of IL-12 in human , but not in mouse , cells .
Species-specific activation of Stai4 by IFN- @ /B To explain the divergent effects of IFN- @ /B and IFN-y on Th1 development in human compared with mouse T cells , we analyzed their ability to activate different signaling pathways .
IFN- « and IFN-B induced a strong and rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Statd4 in human Th1 and Th2 cells .
Our findings are consistent with a recent report showing that IFN-a efficiently induces phosphorylation of Statd in mitogen-activated PBMC ( 51 ) .
Thus , both IL-12 and IFN- @ /B activate Stat4 , a protein critically involved in the generation of Th1 responses ( 23 , 24 ) .
In contrast , IFN-a treatment does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 in Th1 and Th2 cells generated from DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice , confirming that IFN-a is unable to activate Stat4 in a mouse Th1 clone ( 15 ) .
These data indicate a striking and to date unparalleled species-specific activation of a STAT factor and provide a molecular basis for the finding that IFN- @ /B are powerful inducers of Th1 development only in human cells .
Given the importance of Stat4 activation for Th1 phenotype development , it is conceivable that activation of Statd in response to type I IFNs produced , for example , in the course of a viral infection may induce Th1 development in human T cells independently of IL-12 .
Functional effects of STAT activation on differentiated Th2 cells The analysis of Stat4- and Stat6-deficient mice has revealed that activation of Stat4 and Stat6 is necessary for the development of Th1 and Th2 responses , respectively ( 20-24 ) , but is activation of Stat4 and Stat6 sufficient to alter the cytokine secretion pattern characteristic for differentiated Th1 and Th2 cells , respec-tively ?
Our finding that IFN- @ /B induce Stat4 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding to a similar extent in human Th1 and Th2 cells might suggest that IFN- @ / $ B , in addition to the induction of Th1 differentiation of naive T cells , have similar functional effects on established Th2 cells .
Alternatively , activation of Statd4 may only be required at priming of T cells or at early stages of Th subset development to induce differentiation toward the Th1 phenotype .
We have analyzed whether IFN-treatment of established Th2 lines and clones can , at least tran-siently , restore IFN-y production .
Our finding that restimulation of Th2 lines and clones in the presence of IFN-a @ does not significantly increase IFN-y secretion indicates that activation of Stat4 , which is essential to initiate the genetic program leading 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology to the development of Th1 immune responses , is not sufficient to induce IFN-y production in differentiated Th2 cells .
It will be interesting to analyze whether activation of Stat4 in Th2 cells via IFN- @ /B can induce other Thl1-specific functions .
In conclusion , our findings suggest that the loss of IL-12 responsiveness along Th2 differentiation may be important to establish a hierarchy between the Th2- and Th1-inducing signals of IL-4 and IL-12 , respectively , but is not required to maintain the polarized phenotype of Th2 cells .
Once effector T cells have reached their developmental end point , other factors may be implicated in maintaining the polarized phenotype .
Recent reports have demonstrated the differential expression of c-maf and GATA-3 transcription factors in Thl1 and Th2 cells and their contributions to the maintenance of Th phenotypes ( 52 , 53 ) .
