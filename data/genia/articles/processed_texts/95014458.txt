The Role of Cellular Transcription Factor E2F in the Regulation of edc2 mRNA Expression and Cell Cycle Control of Human Hematopoietic Cells* ( Received for publication , May 31 , 1994 , and in revised form , July 28 , 1994 ) Yusuke Furukawa , Yasuhito Terui , Kumi Sakoe , Masatsugu Ohta , and Masaki Saito ?
From the Division of Hemopotesis , Institute of Hematology , Jichi Medical School , Tochigi 329-04 , Japan cde2 mRNA transcripts were detected in immature bone marrow cells and became undetectable along with differentiation .
Peripheral blood resting cells did not express cdc2 mRNA , but it was induced in lymphocytes when the cells reentered the cell cycle in response to specific mitogens .
In contrast , ede2 mRNA could not be induced in granulocytes and monocytes even after the culture with the appropriate stimulants .
In order to investigate the mechanism of the regulation of edc2 mRNA expression in hematopoietic cells , we isolated the -flanking sequence of the ede2 gene and found the putative E2F binding site at the position of nucleotides -124 to -117 .
The binding of E2F at this region was detected by a gel-retardation assay and DNasel footprinting in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T-lymphocytes , which was coincident with the expression of cedc2 mRNA .
E2F binding was not observed in both granulocytes and monocytes .
Transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that the region containing E2F binding site had a strong promoter activity , and introduction of the mutation at the E2F binding site resulted in a significant loss of the activity .
EZ2F-1 and DP-1 mRNAs were not detectable in granulocytes , monocytes and resting T-lymphocytes but were induced after the mitogenic stimulation of T-lymphocytes .
The indue-tion of E2F activity preceded the appearance of ecdc2 mRNA , which is consistent with the role of E2F in the regulation of edc2 mRNA expression , These results suggest that ede2 mRNA expression is related to the cell cycling of normal human hematopoietic cells and that EZF plays some roles in the regulation of its expression .
The division cycle of eukaryotic cells is regulated by a family of protein kinases known as the cyclin-dependent kinases .
At least five cyclin-dependent kinases were now well character-ized , and the sequential activation of individual members of this family and their consequent phosphorylation of critical substrates such as the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product ( Rb ) promotes orderly progression through the cell cycle * This work was supported in part by a grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Education Science and Culture of Japan and by a grant from the Yamanouchi Foundation for Research on Metabolic Disorders .

Among them , the role of CDC2 in cell cycle control has been most extensively investigated .
The cdc2 gene was originally identified in fission yeast as an essential cell cycle control element for both ( G , /S and G , /M transition ( 3 ) .
It encodes a serine/threonine kinase designated as p34 `` , which is now known to be a catalytic subunit of the mitosis-regulating protein kinase complex known as maturation promoting factor ( 4 , 5 ) .
Both biochemical and genetic experiments implicate an involvement of CDCZ homologue in regulation of mitotic initiation in mammalian cells ( 6 , 7 ) , whereas other members of cyclin-dependent kinases especially cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4 were reported to mediate G , to S transition instead of CDC2 ( 8-10 ) .
Posttranslational regulation is believed to be fundamentally important in the control of CDC2 kinase func-tion , ie .
the activity of p34 `` is regulated by the complex formation with cyclins ( 11 ) and phosphorylation of tyrosine 15 ( 12 ) and threonine 161 ( 13 ) .
However , recent evidence suggests that only a newly synthesized CDCZ protein can be modified and activated for exhibiting its kinase activity .
Thus , regulation at the transcriptional level might also be important for a control of CDC2 kinase activity ( 14 , 15 ) , There is an increasing evidence that p34 `` levels in mammalian cells are modulated in response to cellular growth states by regulating levels of ecde2 mRNA , in contrast to the earlier observations in the yeast ( 16 ) .
ede2 mRNA is almost undetectable in resting cells such as peripheral blood T-lymphocytes or serum-starved fibroblasts and it increased in a regulatory manner as cells enter the cell cycle by mitogenic stimuli ( 17 , 18 ) .
In contrast , cdce2 mRNA transcript is constitutively expressed in the certain subsets of cancer cells or cell lines of which substantial numbers are in a cycling state ( 19 ) , suggesting that the regulation of edc2 expression at the level of transcription is as important as the posttranslational modifications in cell cycle control of higher eukaryotic cells .
Recently , there have been three reports dealing with analysis of the promoter region of cde2 gene ( 20-22 ) .
However , these papers contain some conflicting results , and a precise analysis of transcriptional regulation of edc2 gene in a particular cell system such as hematopoietic cells has not yet been reported .
Hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation are known to be tightly regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner ( 23 ) .
Primary hematopoietic cells are gradually losing their cell cycling capacity along with differentiation , suggesting that the regulation of hemopoiesis is closely related to the function of cell cycle control genes .
Therefore , analysis of cell cycle control elements is important for a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of hematopoietic cell growth and differen- retinoblastoma susceptibility gene ; GM-CSF , granulocyte-macrophage CSF ; G-CSF , granulocyte CSF ; M-CSF , macrophage CSF ; PCR , polymerase chain reaction ; RCE , retinoblastoma control element ; nt , nucleo-tide ( s ) ; bp , base pair ( s ) ; kb , kilobase pair ( s ) .

Recently , we and others have shown that expression of CDC2 plays an important role in the proliferation of normal hematopoietic cells , i.e .
proliferation of immature bone marrow cells or mitogen-stimulated T-lymphocytes was inhibited by blocking the expression of cdc2 mRNA with antisense oligonucleotides ( 18 , 24 ) .
In this study , we examined the expression of cde2 mRNA in various types of human hematopoietic cells and investigated the mechanisms of its regulation .
We have found that 1 ) cde2 mRNA expression is correlated with cell cycle status of hematopoietic cells , 2 ) the changes in chromatin structure and DNA methylation status are not likely to be involved in the regulation of cde2 mRNA expression in normal hematopoietic cells and , instead , 3 ) a cellular transcription factor E2F plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression in hematopoietic cells .

RESULTS Expression of edc2 mRNA in Human Primary Hematopoietic Cells-Expression of ecde2 mRNA was examined by Northern blotting in hematopoietic cells from the healthy volunteers .
As shown in Fig .
1 , ede2 mRNA transcripts ( 1.8 and 1.6 kb ) were readily detected in immature blasts/promyelocytes fraction of bone marrow cells and became undetectable after the myelocytes/metamyelocytes stage in granulocytic differentiation .
The significant proportion ( 20-40 % ) of leukemic cells such 26251 as HL-60 or JOSK-I are in S and G , /M phases of the cell cycle .
cde2 mRNA expression was also observed in these cells ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
In contrast , peripheral blood resting cells ( more than 95 % are in G/G , phase ) including mature granulocytes , monocytes , and T-lymphocytes did not express cde2 mRNA transcripts ( Fig .
2 ) .
As shown in Fig .
2 , ecde2 mRNA transcripts could be induced in T-lymphocytes after 48 h of the stimulation with 2 ug/ml of PHA-P in accordance with the reentry into the cell cycle .
This is fully consistent with previous reports , including ours ( 18 , 45 , 46 ) .
ecde2 mRNA expression could not be induced in mature granulocytes even after the culture with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF ( Fig .
2 ) or 5 ng/ml G-CSF ( data not shown ) for 24 h. ecde2 mRNA transcripts were also absent in peripheral blood monocytes even after the culture with 10 ng/ml of GM-CSF or 3000 units/ml of M-CSF up to 72 h ( Fig .
2 ) , whereas the expression of the cell activation-related genes such as interleu-kin-1 receptor antagonist was strongly positive in these cells ( data not shown ) .
The lack of induction of CDC2 expression in monocytes and granulocytes was also confirmed at the level of protein products by Western blotting ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that cde2 mRNA expression is important for the proliferation and cell cycling of normal hematopoietic cells and that the failure to induce CDC2 expression may contribute to the terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells .
It is also suggested that deregulation of ecde2 mRNA expression might be implicated in the altered growth of leukemic cells .
The Changes in Chromatin Structure and DNA Methylation Status of the edc2 Gene in Hematopoietic Cells-Recent observations suggest that the changes in chromatin structure as characterized by the appearance of DNase I hypersensitivity sites or the alteration of DNA methylation status were involved in the regulation of tissue-specific or differentiation-specific expression of genes such as myeloperoxidase ( 35 ) and B-globin ( 47 ) .
We therefore examined whether these changes were observed in hematopoietic cells in accordance with ede2 mRNA expression .
First , chromatin structure of the cdc2 gene was evaluated by DNase I treatment of isolated nuclei from HL-60 cells and by Southern blotting .
As a control , the structure of myeloperoxidase gene was examined in the same manner .
In addition to an 18-kb germline band , four subbands , designated HS-1 through HS-4 , became detectable on myeloperoxidase Southern blotting in the cells treated with increasing amounts of DNase I ( Fig .
34 ) .
The molecular size of each subband was consistent with previous reports : HS-1 , 7.0 kb ; HS-2 , 3.5 kb ; HS-3 , 2.7 kb ; and HS-4 , 1.7 kb ( 35 ) .
DNase I hypersensitivity analysis was performed on the cdc2 gene using the same samples .
As shown in Fig .
34 , in addition to a 15-kb germline band , two weak subbands ( 2.5 and 2.1 kb ) representing DNase I hypersensitivity sites in the cdc2 gene were observed in HL-60 cells , which constitutively expressed cde2 mRNA transcripts .
The same type of subbands was also observed in another leukemic cell line , JOSK-I ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , no detectable subbands were present in resting T-lymphocytes , consistent with the lack of ede2 mRNA expression .
However , DNase I hypersensitive sites were not observed in T-lymphocytes after the culture with PHA-P for 48 h in spite of the induction of cde2 mRNA transcripts and the cell cycle entry ( Fig .
3B ) .
No detectable hypersensitivity sites were present in immature bone marrow cells and in mature granulocytes both before and after culture with GM-CSF or G-CSF ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that the regulatory mechanism of ede2 mRNA expression in normal cdc2-expressing hematopoietic cells is possibly different from that of leukemia cells , and hence , abnormalities in this mechanism might contribute to the deregulated expression of edc2 in leukemia cells .

2. ede2 mRNA expression in various hematopoietic cells .
Normal peripheral blood T-lymphocytes , granulocytes , and monocytes were cultured for 24-72 h with 2 ug/ml of PHA-P or 20 ng/ml of GM-CSF as indicated .
RNA was isolated at given time points and subjected to Northern blot analysis for cde2 mRNA expression .
Two leukemia cell lines , HL-60 and JOSK-I , were used as positive controls .
Ethidium bromide staining of the gel is shown to indicate the amounts of RNA loaded .
Regulation of tissue- or differentiation-specific gene expression is often associated with changes in methylation of cytidine residues at dinucleotide sequence CpG in the -flanking region of the gene ( 48 ) .
The methylation status of the 5'-region of the edc2 gene was assessed both in cde2-expressing cells ( HL-60 and PHA-stimulated T-lymphocytes ) and in cde2 nonexpressing cells ( resting T-lymphocytes , resting and stimulated monocytes , and granulocytes ) .
Genomic DNA from these cells were digested with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes ( HapII and Smal ) and methylation-insensitive isoschizomers ( MspI and Xmal ) followed by Southern blotting with 5'-cde2 cDNA probe .
The pattern of methylation status was not different between edc2-expressors including HL-60 cell line and nonexpressors in this experiment ( data not shown ) .
The above findings indicate that the changes in chromatin structure and DNA methylation are not implicated in the regulation of ecde2 mRNA expression in normal hematopoietic cells , although only a limited part of the methylation sites could be analyzed in the method used in this study .
It is possible that the presence of DNase I hypersensitivity site is responsible for cde2 mRNA expression in leukemic cells as shown in HL-60 and JOSK-I cell lines .
Detailed analysis on this subject will be reported elsewhere . ``
These results prompted us to isolate 5'-regulatory segment of the cdc2 gene and to examine the role of transacting factors in the regulation of ecde2 mRNA expression in normal hematopoietic cells .
The Structure of 5'-regulatory Element of the edc2 Gene-An approximately 850-bp fragment has been isolated after the second round of a ligation-mediated PCR .
A part of the sequence was shown in Fig .
4 .
The sequence analysis revealed that approximately 50 bp were identical to the 5'-region of ecde2 cDNA ( 31 ) .
The CAP site was determined by the primer extension analysis ( data not shown ) and shown as -1 in Fig .
4 .
These results were consistent with the findings reported by others ( 20 , 21 ) .
Although a TATA-like element was present at the position of nucleotides -311 to -306 and a CCAAT motif was noted at the position of nucleotides -291 to -287 , these elements were located too far upstream from the transcription initiation site as active regulatory elements .
The sequence analysis also revealed a putative E2F binding site at the posi- 2 Y. Furukawa , Y. Terui , and M. Saito , manuscript in preparation .
tion of nucleotides -124 to -117 ( 5-TTTCGCGC-3 ) and two core sequences of the retinoblastoma control element ( RCE ) at the positions of nucleotides -112 to -106 ( 5'-GCCACCC-3 ' ) and -165 to -159 ( 5'-CCCGCCC-3 ' ) .
The whole region was included in the sequence active enough for transactivation of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct ( 20 ) .
Recent evidences suggest that both E2F and Rb play an important role in the cell cycle control of eukaryotic cells ( 49 , 50 ) .
We therefore investigated the actual interaction of these molecules with the isolated segment of regulatory region of the edec2 gene in order to clarify the role of E2F and Rb in the regulation of ede2 mRNA expression in hematopoietic cells .
Binding of E2F Protein to a Putative E2F Binding Site in 5'-Regulatory Sequence of the edc2 Gene-To investigate the role of E2F and Rb proteins in transactivation of cdc2 gene expression , gel-retardation assay was performed with nuclear extracts from either edce2-expressing or edc2 nonexpressing hematopoietic cells .
A 87-bp BbilI-BamII fragment of the 5'-regulatory sequence of ecde2 gene containing a putative E2F binding site and two RCEs was end-labeled with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment , purified with 8 % native polyacrylamide gel , and used as a probe for gel retardation assays ( see Fig .
4 for the sequence ) .
As shown in Fig .
5A , multiple bands with retarded mobilities were present in the nuclear extracts from HL-60 cell line and from both resting and PHA-stimulated T-lymphocytes , whereas no retarded bands were observed in those from granulocytes and monocytes before and after the culture with CSFs .
The patterns of the appearance of these bands were almost identical to those of E2F reported by others ( 49-52 ) .
To confirm that these complexes represent the specific E2F binding , the oligonucleotide competition assay was performed .
As shown in Fig .
5B , all bands were completely eliminated by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide containing E2F binding site .
In contrast , unlabeled oligonucleotides containing either AP-1 or SP-1 binding site did not affect these complexes .
Deoxycholate treatment and antibody perturbation experiments revealed that the slowest migrating band in PHA-stimulated T-lymphocytes and HL-60 cells contained cyclin A and that the fastest migrating band , which occasionally appeared as a doublet representing so-called free E2F ( data not shown ) .

E2F binding activity in various hematopoietic cells .
A , nuclear extracts were prepared from T-lymphocytes , granulocytes , and monocytes before and after the culture with PHA , G-CSF , and GM-CSF , respectively .
Gel retardation assay was carried out with *P-labeled Bbill-BamII fragment of 5'-regulatory sequence of the edc2 gene .
HL-60 cell line was used as a positive control .
E2Ffree means free E2F that involves the interaction of a single E2F molecule with the probe .
E2FcyclinA and E2FRb indicate E2F present in a complex with cyclinA and Rb proteins , respectively .
A distinct E2F complex with an unidentified protein is indicated by an asterisk .
B , specificity of the E2F binding was confirmed by the oligonucleotides competition assay .
Gel shift assay was carried out with nuclear extracts from T-lymphocytes cultured with PHA for 48 h in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing either AP-1 , SP-1 , or E2F binding site .
C , E2F activity in RB-deficient cells .
Nuclear extract was isolated from a RB-deficient human lung cancer cell line LUG65 , and gel-shift assay was performed as described above .
T-lymphocytes were cultured with PHA for 72 h and used as a control ( 7-72 ) .
tain Rb .
These bands were hereinafter designated as E2FcyclinA , E2Ffree , and E2FRb , respectively .
The mobility of the most prominent band in resting T-cells ( asterisk in Fig .
5A ) was not affected by either anti-Rb , anti-p107 , or anti-cyclin A .
However , this band was also eliminated by the addition of cold E2F oligonucleotides , suggesting that it represents a distinct E2F complex containing cellular proteins other than Rb , p107 , and cyclin A .
These results confirmed the previous findings reported by Chittenden et al .
( 52 ) .
To determine whether or not these bands were related to RCEs , the same experiments were performed with a nuclear extract from RB-deficient human lung cancer cell line LUG65 .
As expected , E2FcyclinA and E2Ffree were present in a lysate from LU65 cells , whereas E2FRb was not detected in a compatible one without Rb ( Fig .
5C ) .
This experiment also indicated that RCE-related complex was not detected in this condition .
To further confirm the binding specificity , in vitro DNase I footprinting analysis was carried out with each E2F complex ede2 Expression in Hematopoietic Cells ( A ) _ 209° 150000 S ; 100000 - 50000 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ( B ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Fic .

Promoter activity of 5'-regulatory sequence of the edc2 gene .
Promoter activity of 5'-flanking sequence of the cdc2 gene was investigated by the transient transfection assay with the following chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs : 1 , pCAT-basic vector ; 2 , pCAT-enhancer vector ; 3 , pCAT-control vector ; 4 , pCAT-basic vector containing a wild type 5'-regulatory sequence of ede2 ( -377 to +90 ) ; 5 , pCAT-enhancer vector containing a wild type 5-edc2 ; 6 , pCAT-basic vector containing 5'-regulatory sequence of ede2 ( -377 to +90 ) with a mutation at the E2F binding site ; 7 , pCAT-enhancer vector containing a mutant 5'-edc2 .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were performed in duplicate , and the activities were measured simultaneously by a liquid scintillation counting ( A ) and by a thin-layer chromatography ( B ) according to the standard methods .
B-galactosid-ase activities generally varied no more than 2-fold between different extracts , indicating that transfection efficiencies between plates were comparable ( data not shown ) .
from PHA-stimulated T-lymphocytes .
The specific binding of E2F to the region between nucleotides -124 to -117 was demonstrated in all samples including E2FeyclinA , E2FRb , and free E2F ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that specific E2F binding at the region between nucleotides -124 to -117 in the regulatory sequence of the cde2 gene was observed in concomitant with the expression of ede2 mRNA transcripts in hematopoietic cells except for the presence of a small amount of distinct E2F complex in resting T-lymphocytes .
Although the role of two RCEs in this region was not demonstrated under the experimental condition in this study , the involvement of other protein factors including RB protein in the regulation of cde2 mRNA expression of hematopoietic cells could not be ruled out .
Further investigation should be required to clarify this point .
Promoter Activity of 5'-Untranslated Sequence of the edc2 Gene-Promoter activity of the isolated sequence and the effect of E2F binding on the promoter activity were investigated by a transient transfection assay of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs .
As shown in Fig .

E2F-1/RBAP-1 mRNA expression in hematopoietic cells .
The membranes used in the experiments shown in Fig .
2 were rehybridized with P-labeled cDNA encoding E2F-1/RBAP-1 .
SV40 enhancer element , a significant reduction of the promoter activity was observed ( lane 5 ) .
This result suggests the presence of inhibitory element in the upstream portion of this segment and its activation by the SV40 enhancer .
To investigate the role of E2F binding on the promoter activity , the activity of the reporter constructs containing a mutant E2F binding site ( 5'-TTTCGCGC-3 ' to 5'-TTTCGTAC-3 ' ) was tested in the same manner .
A significant reduction of the promoter activity was noted both in pCAT-basic/5'-cdc2 and in pCAT-enhancer/5'-edc2 when the mutation was introduced into the E2F binding site ( Fig .
6 , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
Expression of E2F mRNA in Human Primary Hematopoietic Cells-Recently , multiple cDNAs encoding E2F-related proteins were cloned , and two of them , E2F-1/RBAP-1 ( 33 ) and DP-1 ( 34 ) , were reported to encode the each major component of E2F heterodimer .
To further investigate the relationship between cdec2 mRNA expression and E2F in hematopoietic cells , the membranes used in the experiments shown in Fig .
2 were rehybridized with P-labeled E2F-1/RBAP-1 cDNA .
As shown in Fig .
7 , an authentic 3.1-kb E2F-1 mRNA transcript was readily detected in ede2-expressors ( PHA-stimulated T-lymphocytes , HL-60 , and JOSK-I cell lines ) .
No E2F-1 mRNA expression was observed in cde2 nonexpressors ( resting T-lymphocytes , granulocytes , and monocytes before and after the culture ) .
This is fully consistent with the role of E2F in the regulation of cde2 mRNA expression as described above .
A more detailed time-course experiment was performed with T-cell culture system in order to compare the induction of ede2 transcription with the appearance of E2F activity .
As reported previously ( 18 , 25 , 53 , 54 ) , almost all T-lymphocytes from the peripheral blood were in G , -phase of the cell cycle before the stimulation .
In response to 2 ug/ml of PHA-P , T-lymphocytes were synchronously induced to undergo blastogenesis ( after 6-12 h ) , reach G , /S boundary when Rb began to be phosphorylated ( after 24 h ) , begin DNA synthesis ( after 36 h ) , and initiate mitosis ( after 48 h ) ( Figs .
8 and 9 ) .
RNA was isolated at given time points in this culture system and subjected to Northern blot analysis for E2F-1 mRNA expression .
As shown in Fig .
8 , E2F-1 mRNA was induced after 24 h of the culture with PHA when T-lymphocytes reached G , /S boundary .
Expression of DP-1 mRNA , another member of the E2F gene family , was examined using the same samples .
DP-1 mRNA expression was also induced after 24 h of the culture , although the intensity of the message was weaker than that of E2F-1 mRNA in T-lymphocytes .
Expression of both E2F-1 and DP-1 mRNAs apparently preceded the induction of cde2 mRNA , which was observed after 36 h in this system .

DISCUSSION Cell cycle regulation is known to be very important for the control of hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation ( 23 ) .
Previous studies indicate that pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells are in G/G , phase of the cell cycle , and , after triggered into cell cycle with specific hematopoietic growth factors , they proliferate at relatively constant doubling rates during the early stages of differentiation ( 55 ) .
As a result , a significant portion ( 20-40 % ) of the committed progenitors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid burst-forming units and the morphologically identifiable precursors such as myeloblasts and promyelocytes is in a cycling state ( 56 ) .
These cells gradually lose the cell-cycling capacity along with differentiation and spontaneously arrest the cycling in G/G , phase when released into the peripheral blood as functional mature cells .
Mature lymphocytes can be induced to reenter S phase after exposed to mitogens .
In contrast , although mature myeloid cells ( monocytes and granulocytes ) can be activated by appropriate stimulants , they can not be induced to undergo DNA synthesis or mitosis and , thus , are considered to be terminally differentiated .
These findings indicate that the regulation of hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation should be closely related to the function of cell cycle control genes such edc2 Expression in Hematopoietic Cells as edc2 or RB as previously reported ( 18 , 25 , 53 , 54 ) .
It is well known that eukaryotic cell cycle is tightly regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases ( 1 , 2 ) .
Among them , cde2 gene is most extensively investigated and is considered to be one of the most important genes in a cdk gene family ( 3-7 ) .
In the present study , we examined the expression of ede2 mRNA and studied the mechanism ( s ) of its regulation in normal human hematopoietic cells in order to investigate the role of cde2 gene in the regulation of hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation .
ede2 mRNA transcripts were readily detected in immature bone marrow cells and became undetectable accompanied with the cell cycle arrest during differentiation .
Peripheral blood resting cells including granulocytes , monocytes , and T-lymphocytes did not express ede2 mRNA transcripts .
ecde2 mRNA could be induced in T-lymphocytes when the cells reentered the cell cycle in response to PHA-P .
In contrast , cde2 mRNA could not be induced in granulocytes and monocytes even after the culture with appropriate CSFs .
ede2 mRNA was constitutively expressed in leukemic cells .
Then , we investigated the mechanisms of the regulation of cde2 mRNA expression in hematopoietic cells .
The changes in the chromatin structure such as the appearance of DNase I hypersensitivity sites or the alteration of DNA methylation pattern were not observed in T-lymphocytes even after the induction of ede2 mRNA expression by mitogenic stimuli , although hypersensitivity sites were found in the cdc2 gene in leukemic cells .
Next , we isolated the 5'-flanking sequence of the cdc2 gene by a ligation-mediated PCR and found the putative E2F binding site and two RCEs .
The binding of E2F at the region between nucleotides -124 to -117 was detected by a gel-shift assay and DNase I footprinting in PHA-stimulated T-lymphocytes coincidentally with the expression of cde2 mRNA .
E2F binding was not observed in both granulocytes and monocytes before and after the stimulation .
Transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that the region between -377 and +90 had a strong promoter activity , and introduction of the mutation at the E2F binding site ( 5'-TTTCGCGC-3 ' to 5'-TTTCGATC-3 ' ) resulted in a significant loss of the promoter activity .
The role of RCEs in the regulation of ede2 mRNA expression was not demonstrated in this study .
In consistent with the above results , E2F-1/RBAP-1 mRNA was not detectable in granulocytes , monocytes , and resting T-lymphocytes but induced after 24 h of the mitogenic stimulation of T-lymphocytes .
A more detailed time-course study with T-lymphocyte culture system revealed that three distinct forms of E2F ( E2Ffree , E2FRb , and E2FcyclinA ) were induced after 24 h of the stimulation when the cells were at ( G , /S boundary .
Northern blot analysis suggested that this induction of E2F activity was due to the induction of mRNAs of two major components of E2F gene family , E2F-1/RBAP-1 and DP-1 .
The induction of E2F activity apparently preceded the appearance of ede2 mRNA , which is consistent with the role of E2F in the regulation of edc2 mRNA expression .
E2F is a mammalian transcription factor that was originally detected as a cellular protein involved in activation of the ad-enovirus E2 promoter ( 57 ) .
Subsequent studies have revealed that E2F may also play a critical role in cell cycle control of many types of mammalian cells ( for review , see Ref .
58 ) .
The promoter region of several important genes including e-myc , N-mye , c-myb , epidermal growth factor receptor , and dihydrofolate reductase contains sequences similar to the E2F binding site ( consensus sequence , TTTCGCGC ) of the E2 promoter .
For c-mye and dihydrofolate reductase , this promoter sequence has been shown to be sufficient to activate gene transcription ( 59 ) .
E2F activity appears to be regulated by formation of the complex with other cellular proteins .
E2F has been shown to bind to Rb , the Rb-related protein p107 , cyclinA , and additional cde2 Expression in Hematopoietic Cells unidentified proteins ( 49-52 ) .
The formation and dissociation of these complexes correlates with progression through the cell cycle , and recent evidence suggests that the complexed E2F , especially in a form associated with Rb , is functionally inactive , while free E2F is the transcriptionally active ( 60 ) .
E2F from HeLa cells fractionates into at least five components that can be separated into two complementation groups .
Reconstitution of full E2F activity , including optimal DNA and Rb binding , requires dimerization of two proteins , one from each group ( 61-63 ) .
Recently , several cDNAs encoding proteins with properties similar to EZF from HeLa cells have been cloned ( 33 , 34 , 64 , 65 ) .
Among them , E2F-1/RBAP-1 and E2F-2 belong to the same complementation group , while DP-1 is a member of the second group and heterodimerizes with E2F-1 to form high affinity E2F .
The E2F-1/DP-1 heterodimer can reveal full transactivating activity , which is repressed by Rb coexpres-sion as is the case for native E2F ( 61-63 ) .
In this paper , we reported the presence of E2F binding site at the position of nucleotides -124 to -117 of 5 ' -flanking region of the ede2 gene , and found that EZF actually bound to this region in PHA-stimulated T-lymphocytes coincident with the expression of cde2 mRNA .
A strong promoter activity was demonstrated in this region by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay , and the promoter activity was significantly diminished by mutation at the E2F binding site .
In our analysis , the presence of a negative-regulatory region at the upstream of the E2F binding site was also suggested .
This negative regulation might be mediated through RCE at the position of nucleotides -165 to -159 , although the binding of any factors to this region was not detected by our analysis .
Using T-lymphocyte culture system , we also demonstrated that E2F activity was induced at G , /S boundary and apparently preceded the induction of cde2 mRNA in early S-phase .
This induction of E2F activity might be due to the induction of E2F-1/RBAP-1 and DP-1 mRNAs , which are required for full E2F activity .
Taken together , it is reasonable to speculate that EZF is involved in the positive regulation of cdec2 mRNA expression and , thus , in the cell cycle control of hematopoietic cells .
Recently , the presence of EZF binding site at 5'-flanking sequence of the edc2 gene has been reported by three other groups ( 20-22 ) .
However , there are some controversies about the role of E2F in the regulation of cde2 mRNA expression .
Dalton ( 20 ) reported that the cde2 promoter has a E2F binding site that is required for repression of transcription of a cde2 promoter by cotransfection of RB plasmid but that is not very important for normal promoter activity in human fibroblasts , since a edc2 promoter lacking a E2F site showed only a 30 % decrease in transcriptional activity .
Yamamoto et al .
( 22 ) also reported that the region between -129 and -116 mediates the basal promoter activity , although upstream sequence between -310 and -208 is required for a full activity .
In contrast , Ku et al .
( 21 ) reported that critical sequence for a promoter activity is located between -253 and -245 , and that e-my6 is more important in the regulation of ecde2 mRNA expression .
Our present study is somewhat conflicting with these reports .
These discrepancies could be , at least in part , explained by the differences in the experimental conditions .
For example , we did not perform overexpression of Rb by co-transfection , so we could not fully activate the negative-regulatory region , nor did we use NIH 3T3 cells that contain structurally different Rb from the human counterpart .
Therefore , it is possible that we underestimated the role of the negative regulatory sequence .
In summary , together with the previous findings that proliferation of immature bone marrow cells and mitogen-stimulated T-lymphocytes was inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides against ede2 ( 18 , 24 ) , our present results indicate that ede2 26257 mRNA expression is important for the proliferation and cell cycling of normal human hematopoietic cells and that the failure to induce edc2 expression may contribute to the terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells .
Although our results clearly demonstrated that ede2 transcription in hematopoietic cells correlates with the presence of active E2F in vitro , the physiological significance of the E2F binding to the edc2 promoter remains to be clarified .
