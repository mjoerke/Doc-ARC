and M. Celeste Simon**t From the *Committee on Immunology , *Department of Medicine , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 ; and the Hematology /Oncology Division , Department of Medicine , Beth Israel Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Summary Spi-B and PU.1 are hematopoietic-specific transcription factors that constitute a subfamily of the Ets family of DNA-binding proteins .
Here we show that contrary to previous reports , PU.1 and Spi-B have very different expression patterns .
PU.1 is expressed at high levels in B cells , mast cells , megakaryocytes , macrophages , neutrophils , and immature erythroid cells and at lower levels in mature erythrocytes .
PU.1 is completely absent from peripheral T cells and most T cell lines based on sensitive RT-PCR assays .
In contrast , Spi-B is expressed exclusively in lymphoid cells and can be detected in early fetal thymus and spleen .
In situ hybridizations of adult murine tissues demonstrate Spi-B mRNA in the medulla of the thymus , the white pulp of the spleen , and the germinal centers of lymph nodes .
Spi-B expression is very abundant in B cells and both Spi-B mRNA and protein are detected in some T cells .
In situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis suggest that Spi-B gene expression increases during B cell maturation and decreases during T cell maturation .
Gel-retardation experiments show that Spi-B can bind to all putative PU.1 binding sites , but do not reveal any preferred Spi-B binding site .
Finally , both PU.1 and Spi-B function as transcriptional activators of the immunoglobulin light-chain enhancer Ey , when coexpressed with Pip ( PU.l-interaction partner ) in NIH-3T3 cells .
Taken together , these data suggest that differences in patterns of expression between Spi-B and PU.1 distinguish the function of each protein during development of the immune system .
Hematopoiesis generates eight distinct lineages from self-renewing pluripotential stem cells , which then differentiate into mature blood cells .
The molecular mechanisms underlying self-renewal and lineage commitment of stem cells have not been resolved .
However , the process is regulated in part by hematopoietic-specific transcription factors .
For example , stem cell leukemia ( SCL ) !
is required for yolk sac hematopoiesis ( 1 , 2 ) , GATA-1 regulates red cell maturation ( 3 , 4 ) ; Ikaros is important for the development of lymphocytes , natural killer cells , and neutrophils ( 5 , 6 ) ; and Oct-2 is essential for T cell-independent B cell activation and B cell maturation into immunoglobulin secreting cells ( 7 , 8 ) .
The function of a transcription factor in hematopoiesis is somewhat correlated to its expression pat-tern .
PU.1 is expressed at high levels in B cells , granulo-cytes , monocytes , and immature erythroid cells ( 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ) .
We have previously determined that PU.1~'~-defi- ' Abbreviations used in this paper : CAT , chloramphenical acetyl transferase ; DN , double negative ; DP , double positive ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assays ; FcyR , Fo fragments ; IVT , in vitro-translated ; RT , reverse transcribed ; SCL , stem cell leukemia ; SP , single positive .
cient embryos die between days 16 and 18 of gestation and mutant embryos do not produce T and B lymphocytes , gran-ulocytes , and monocytes ( 13 ) .
In addition , some day 16.5 embryos are also anemic ( 13 ) .
Transcription factors of the Ets family are widely studied as key regulators of genes involved in the immune response and cellular proliferation .
Spi-B and PU.1 are members of the Ets family , which now includes ~20 members .
Spi-B was cloned from a Burkitt lymphoma cDNA library using the human PU.1 Ets DNA-binding domain as a probe ( 12 ) , and it shares a 67 % amino acid Ets-domain identity and 43 % overall amino acid sequence identity to PU.1 ( 12 ) .
Like most of the Ets family members , Spi-B has the DNA-binding domain at its basic carboxy terminus and an acidic amino-terminal domain that corresponds to the transactiva-tional domain in PU.1 .
PU.1 and Spi-B are the most distantly related genes to other Ets family members , as their Ets domains present only 40 % identity to Ets-1 ( 12 ) .
Spi-B can bind specifically to the putative PU.1 binding site in the SV40 promoter , and can also transactivate a reporter construct containing multiple PU boxes .

Here we report that significant amounts of Spi-B mRNA are detected in B and T cells , but not in monocytic cells .
On the contrary , PU.1 mRNA can not be detected by the most sensitive means , such as RT-PCR , in purified human peripheral T cells or any T cell lines examined .
Spi-B is not present in any other non-lymphoid cells based on in situ hybridization analyses .
Spi-B is first expressed in the fetal thymus and spleen , and Spi-B mRNA is localized to the medulla of the thymus , white pulp of the spleen , and the germinal centers of the lymph nodes of adult mice .
Spi-B is able to bind to all predicted PU.1-binding sites in vitro , including myeloid target genes .
Both Spi-B and PU.1 in Clone 13 B cells bind to the functional PU.1-binding site in the Igk 3 ' enhancer .
Both Pu.1 and Spi-B function as transcriptional activators of the IgA 2-4 enhancer .
We postulate that Spi-B plays an important role in lymphocytic development based on its pattern of expression .
Materials and Methods Northern Analysis and RT-PCR .
- Total RNAs were prepared from cells or tissues using Trizol ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Poly-A* RNAs were then prepared from total cellular RNAs using the Oligotex poly-A* mRNA purification protocol ( QIAGEN , Chatsworth , CA ) .
Poly-A* RNA samples ( 2 ug each ) were separated by elec-trophoresis on 1.2 % agarose gels containing formaldehyde and blotted onto Hybond-N+ membranes .
Hybridizations were carried out at 42°C in 50 % formamide , 50 mM hepes ( pH 7.0 ) , 5 % Denhardt 's solution , 3X SSC , 0.16 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA , 0.1 % SDS , and 5 % dextran sulfite .
Membranes were washed twice in 2X SSC/0.1 % SDS at room temperature for 10 min , and twice in 0.1X SSC/0.1 % SDS at 55°C for 30 min .
The human Spi-B probe ( 3'-UTR , from the EcoRV site in Spi-B to the EcoRI site in pBluescript , ~300 bp long ) and murine Spi-B probe ( 3'-UTR , NdeI to BamHI , 600 bp long ) were labeled by random hexapriming .
For RT-PCR analysis , total RNA was reverse transcribed ( RT ) in a 20-wl volume with reagents from Perkin-Elmer ( Nor-walk , CT ) : Moloney murine Leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( 50 U ) , RNase inhibitor ( 20 U ) , dNTPs ( 1 mM final concentration ) , Oligo d ( t ) ; , ( 2.5 mM final concentration ) , MgCl , ( 5 mM final concentration ) , KCI ( 50 mM final concentration ) , and Tris-HCl , pH 8.3 ( 10 mM final concentration ) .
Samples were incubated at 42°C for 15 min 99°C for 5 min , and 5°C for 5 min .
The salt concentration for PCR was optimized using the Optiprime kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) for each set of primers according to the manufacturer 's instruction .
The entire RT reaction was subjected to 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min , primer annealing at 65°C , and primer extension at 72°C for 2 min .
Antibodies .
- The coding sequence of human Spi-B cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T3 ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) .
Spi-B-GST fusion protein was induced at 1.25 mM IPTG and subsequently purified using the Bulk GST Purification Module ( Pharmacia ) .
Polyclonal anti-Spi-B antisera were obtained from rabbits immunized with the Spi-B-GST fusion protein ( Pocono Rabbit Farm & Labora-tory , Canadensis , PA ) .
Monoclonal anti-PU.1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc .
In Vitro Translation and Western Blot Analysis .
- IVT proteins were synthesized from human Spi-B and murine PU.1 cDNA linked to the T7 promoter in pCDNA3 vectors using Promega TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System .
IVT proteins were quanti-tated by their [ * `` S ) Jmethionine incorporation , to determine that equal amounts of Spi-B and PU.1 proteins were loaded for each assay .
IVT proteins and total cell lysates obtained from 2 X 10° cells each were subjected to 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel elec-trophoresis followed by electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose .
The membranes were probed with the polyclonal antiserum to Spi-B in 10 mM Tris , pH 7.5 , 150 mM NaCl , and 5 % nonfat milk .
The immune complexes were revealed by the ECL Western blotting detection system ( Amersham Corp. , Arlington Heights , IL ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Cell Purification .
_ To purify splenic B cells , ammonium chloride-lysed spleen cells were subjected to anti-Thy1.2/complement de-pletion .
Splenic T cells were purified from red cell-depleted spleens using a Mouse T Cell Enrichment Column ( R & D Sys-tems , Minneapolis , MN ) and anti-J11D/complement lysis .
The purity of final cell populations was determined by flow cytometry using B220 ( B cell ) and CD3 ( T cell ) surface antigens .
Purified B cells were determined to be 98 % pure , and T cells were 85 % pure .
For T cell sorting , adult BL/6 thymi were processed into single cell suspensions and resuspended at 5 X 10° cells per ml in 5 % complete media ( 5 % fetal bovine serum , 1X non-essential amino acids , 1X L-glutamine , 1X Pen-Strep , 50 M B-mercap-toethanol in DMEM ) .
Thymocytes were incubated with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) at 1 g/10° cells for 30 min at 4°C .
The incubation was followed by two washes with complete media .
Cells were resuspended at 4 X 10° cells/ml in complete media for sorting by flow cytometry .
In Situ Hybridization .
- Adult murine tissues ( thymus , lymph nodes , heart , lung , spleen , and liver ) were sectioned and mounted for in situ hybridization .
Sense and anti-sense riboprobes were made from the 3'-UTR of murine Spi-B ( NdeI to BamHI ) linked to the T7 promoter in pBluescript .
The protocol utilized was essentially as described by Eichele and coworkers ( 14 ) .
Tissues were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde/PBS and embedded in paraffin .
The sections were rehydrated and treated with 20 mg/ mi proteinase K , and 0.1 M pH 8 .
Pre-treated slides were hybridized overnight at 60°C .
The hybridization mix contained 50 % formamide , 20 mM Tris-HCI , pH 8 , 0.3 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 10 % dextran sulfate , 0.02 % BSA , 0.5 mg/ml tRNA , and 10 mM DTT .
S-labeled riboprobe was mixed with the hybridization mix at 140,000 cpm/l ( 90 ml/ slide ) .
A 1/100th volume of 25 mM 5'-alpha-thio-ATP was added to the probe mix , followed by 2 min of boiling .
After hybridization , slides were washed with 50 % formamide , 2X SSC , and 20 mM DTT for 60 min at 65°C ( high stringency wash ) .
Slide were then washed with STE ( 4X SSC , 20 mM Tris-HCI , pH 7.6 , 1 mM EDTA ) for 10 min twice at 37°C , followed by RNase A treatment ( 10 mg/ml in STE ) for 30 min at 37°C .
This high stringency wash was repeated and then the slides were washed in 2X SSC at 37°C for 10 min .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays ( EMSAs ) .
- In vitro-translated ( IVT ) proteins ( 1.3 jul to 1.5 pl ) or nuclear extracts ( 10 pg ) were preincubated on ice with 1 pg of double-stranded poly ( dI-dC ) and 0.4 g of salmon sperm DNA in 5 % Ficoll binding buffer in a final volume of 19 wl .
For competition experiments , cold competitor oligonucleotide ( 200-300 ng per reaction ) and pre-immune or antiserum were also added at this step .
Radiolabeled probes were diluted to 30,000 cpm/ul and 1 jl was added to the binding reaction for a 10-min incubation at room temperature .

- The CAT reporter construct ( B , TKCAT ) containing multiple copies of the PU.1/Pip binding site of the lambda chain enhancer Ey4 , has been described previously ( 20 ) .
To create Pip/CMV the Pip cDNA was subcloned as a HindlIII-Xbal fragment into the HindIII and Xbal sites in the polylinker of pRc/CMV ( Invitrogen ) , which places the cDNA insert under the control of the CMV promoter ( 21 ) .
NIH-3T3 cells were transfected using Lipofectin ( GIBCO BRL ) and a total of 25 jg of DNA .
Transfection involved 5 jg of reporter construct and 10 pg of the expression constructs , with the balance made up with empty expression vector .
After 48 h at 37°C , cell lysates were prepared and CAT assays performed using 30 pl of lysate as described previously ( 20 ) .
TLC plates were analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager ; the results shown here represent an average of at least four independent transfections .
Results Spi-B mRNAs Are Present Exclusively in Murine Thymus , Spleen , and Lymph Nodes .
To determine the tissue-speci-ficity of Spi-B mRNA expression , tissues from day 18.5 mouse embryos and adult mice were analyzed on poly-A * Northern blots .
To distinguish the expression of Spi-B mRNA compared to PU.1 mRNA , a 3 ' untranslated region ( 3 ' UTR ) probe for the mouse Spi-B cDNA was used .
Spi-B mRNA has been previously detected in B cells ( 12 ) , so splenocytes were used as a positive control .
As shown in Fig .
1 A , high levels of Spi-B mRNA were detected in adult splenocytes ( see lane 1 ) .
The predominant mRNA species was 3.0 kb , in contrast to the 1.4-kb species found in human cells ( see Fig .
6 ) .
However , a faint 1.5-kb species was detected .
Surprisingly , Spi-B mRNA was detected at low levels in adult thymocytes as well ( Fig .
1 A4 , lane 2 ) .
In contrast , Spi~B mRNAs were completely absent in all fetal tissues examined including heart , kidney , brain , and liver ( Fig .
1 A , lanes 3-6 ) .
Adult murine tissues were also examined for Spi-B expression , including heart , liver , lungs , lymph nodes , small intestine , spleen , and testes .

( 4 ) The top panel shows a Northern blot analysis of mRNA samples isolated from fetal murine tissues , adult splenocytes , and adult thymocytes hybridized to a radiolabeled Spi-B 3 ' UTR probe ( 16-h exposure ) .
The Spi-B probe hybridized primarily to a 3.0-kb species and a smaller 1.5-kb species present in purified splenocytes and thymocytes .
The bottom panel shows hybridization to the 1.4-kb glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) probe used as a control for the amount of RNA in each lane .
( B ) The top panel shows a Northern blot analysis of RNA samples obtained from the indicated adult murine tissues ( 20-h exposure ) .
A 3.0-kb transcript was detected in the spleen and lymph nodes ; however , no 1.5-kb species was apparent in this experiment .
GAPDH hybridization is shown in the bottom panel .
A larger GAPDH transcript was observed in the testes sample .
sides the spleen , Spi-B mRNAs were also detected in axil-lary and mesenteric lymph nodes ( Fig .
1 B , lanes 4 and 6 ) .
No other organs from adult mice exhibited significant Spi-B expression .
To further localize Spi-B mRNA expression , in situ hybridization was performed on adult mouse tissues .
In adult tissues , Spi-B mRNA was observed exclusively in the thymus , spleen , and lymph nodes ( Figs .
2 and 3 ) .
Only background signals were detected in heart , intestines , kidney , stomach , lung , and liver ( data not shown ) .
To assess positive in situ hybridization , sense and antisense 3 ' UTR Spi-B probes were incubated with tissue sections .
As shown in Fig .
2 , a , d , and g , the sense probe gave weak hybridization signals as compared to the antisense probe ( b , e , and h ) .
He-matoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of thymus , spleen , and lymph nodes are shown for comparison ( Fig .

In the thymus , Spi~B gene expression was restricted to the medulla region ( Fig .

migrate from the darkly staining thymic cortex to the pale staining medulla where single positive T cells undergo negative selection .
In the spleen , Spi-B mRNA was abundantly expressed throughout the white pulp , except the center portion which consists of arterioles and periarteriolar lymphocyte sheaths ( PALS ) ( Fig .
2 , e ) .
The PALS contains a network of antigen-presenting cells , such as interdigitat-ing dendritic cells , and plasma B cells .
B cells congregate peripherally to the PALS in primary follicles and germinal centers .
The outer most layer of the white pulp is the marginal zone , which contains T and B lymphocytes .
Spi-B mRNA is present in cells surrounding the arterioles and the PALS in the white pulp of the spleen , where T and B lym-phocytes reside .
In lymph nodes , Spi-B is present in the primary follicles ( Fig .
2 , h and i ) .

The spatial pattern of expression of Spi-B in the thymus , spleen and lymph nodes .
In situ hybridization analyses were performed using a ra Spi-B Expression Is Restricted to the Thymus and Spleen during Murine Embryogenesis .
_ To determine the temporal and spatial patterns of expression during mammalian develop-ment , in situ hybridization experiments were performed on tissue sections obtained from mouse embryos at various gestational stages .
Sense and antisense 3 ' UTR Spi-B probes were hybridized to sections of day 7.5 , 8.5 , 10.5 , 14.5 , 16.5 , and 19.5 mouse embryos .
The results are summarized in Fig .
4 and show that Spi-B mRNAs were detected exclusively in fetal thymus and spleen .
Spi-B expression was first observed in the day 14.5 thymus ( Fig .
4 , a and c ) .
All tissues in day 7.5 , 8.5 , and 10.5 embryos failed to react with the antisense Spi-B probe and gave background signals similar to that observed with the control sense probe shown in Fig .
4 b .
Furthermore , all other tissues in the day 14.5 embryo were negative for Spi-B mRNA production ( see Fig .
4 a ) .
It is interesting to note that neither the day 14.5 or day 16.5 spleen exhibited Spi-B gene expression .
However , when sections of day 19.5 embryos were hybridized to the Spi-B probe , the spleen displayed strong signal intensity ( Fig .
4 e ) .
The control sense probe gave the expected background level of hybridization ( Fig .
4 d ) .

Only the thymus and spleen exhibited Spi-B mRNA expression during development .

We conclude that Spi-B gene expression is highly tissue restricted and can only be detected in the developing lymphoid organs of the mouse embryo .
Spi-B Expression Is Developmentally Regulated during T Cell and B Cell Development .
- To further explore Spi-B expression during B cell maturation , immortalized B cell lines representing different developmental stages were studied .
Low level Spi-B expression was detected in pro-B cells ( NFS 70/c10 cells ; Fig .
5 A , lane 1 ) , higher levels in one pre-B cell line ( 38 B9 cells , lane 2 ) , and dramatically increased levels in mature B cells such as A20.1 and WEHI ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Purified splenic B cells exhibited high levels of Spi-B as well ( lane 8 ) .
Low levels of Spi-B mRNAs were detected in the immature T cell line EL-4 ( lane 7 ) and column enriched , anti-J11D/complement depleted splenic T cells .
To determine if Spi-B transcription changes during T cell maturation , T cells were sorted into the CD4~ CD8~ ( double negative : DN ) , CD4* CD8* ( double positive : DP ) , and CD4* or CD8 * single positive ( SP ) pop-ulations .
Interestingly , Spi-B mRNA was most abundant in the CD4~ CD8~ `` double negative `` population ( Fig .
5 C ) .
Furthermore , Rag2~- thymi express higher levels than those obtained from C57BL/6 mice ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Rag 2~~- thymi have previously been shown to contain no DP or SP T cells and to contain essentially 98 % DN cells ( 22 ) .
These results are consistent with Spi-B expression being highest in DN T cell precursors .
Furthermore , Spi-B expression was higher in the immature T cell line , EL-4 , than the mature T cell line , RMA ( Fig .
5 A4 , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Therefore , Spi-B gene expression increases during B cell maturation and decreases during T cell maturation .
Surprisingly , some PU.1 expression was also detected in the CD4~ CD8~ sorted T cells ( Fig .
5 C ) , although it was completely absent in a number of human T cell lines examined by RT-PCR analyses ( Jurkat , H9 , Molt 3 ) and purified human peripheral T cells { data not shown ) .
RT-PCR assays for M-CSF receptor expression indicated that the RNA samples contained no contaminating monocytic cells { data not shown ) .
Finally , it should be noted that Spi-B was found in EL-4 T cells , thymocytes , and the thymus when these samples were run separately ( Fig .
5 B ) .
Spi-B Is Highly Expressed in Human B Cells and Some T Cells at Both the RNA and Protein Levels .
- Several human cell lines were examined for Spi-B expression by poly-A* RNA Northern blot analysis as shown in Fig .
6 .
Spi-B RNA was detected in clone 13 B cells ( lane 1 ) , but was not present in monocytic cells such as U937 and K562 and Jurkat T cells ( lanes 3-5 ) .
Furthermore , TPA treatment of U937 cells ( which converts them from monoblasts to monocytes ) did not induce Spi-B ( lane 2 ) .
Spi-B expression was not apparent in the non-hematopoietic epithelial cell line HeLa or Hep G2 hepatic cells ( lanes 6 and 7 ) .
To determine the tissue specificity of Spi-B protein expression and to confirm that the level of gene expression correlated with the level of protein expression , Western blot analyses were performed .

Importantly , pre-immune sera failed to bind IVT Spi-B , PU.1 , and JunB ( Fig .

Furthermore , it did not cross-react with IVT PU.1 , c-Fos , or JunB ( lanes 5-7 ) .

3.7 , 2.8 , and 1.5-kb RNA species are indicated .
The bottom panel shows hybridization to the control GAPDH radiolabeled probe .
the antisera did not cross react with murine Spi-B ( data not shown ) .
The 46-kd Spi-B protein was detected in all seven B cell lines examined ( Clone 13 , Raji , CCFR-SB , RPMI 7666 , RPMI 1788 , IM-9 , and WIL2-NS ) , and one of the three T cell lines ( H9 ) ( Fig .
7 , A4 and B ) .
No Spi-B protein was detected in the monocytic cell lines K562 and U937 ( Fig .
7 A , lanes 9 and 11 ) or HeLa epithelial cells ( lane 12 ) .
The level of protein expression correlated with the abundance of Spi-B mRNAs .
It is not surprising that Clone 13 and H9 express Spi-B proteins , since they both contain high levels of Spi-B mRNAs ( Fig .
6 and data not shown ) .
It is interesting to note that H9 T cells are less mature than either Jurkat or Molt3 cells ( 23 ) .
Furthermore , IM-9 cells are less mature than Raji , CCRF-SB , RPM1 7666 , RPM1 1788 cells , and WIL2-NSB cells .
Therefore , Spi-B expression appears to decrease as human T cells mature and increase as human B cells mature , as was noted in murine lymphocytes .
Finally , no Spi-B protein was detected in peripheral human T cells ( data not shown ) .
Spi-B Specifically Binds to Putative PU.1 Binding Sites in Monocytic and B Cell Target Genes .
A growing number of PU.1 target genes have been identified in monocytic and B cell lines , including c-fes , the M-CSF receptor , and the high affinity receptor for Fc fragments ( FcyR ) in monocytes and ] chain and « and A immunoglobulin light chains in B cells .
To assess PU.1 versus Spi-B DNA-binding specificity , electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were performed with IVT PU.1 and Spi-B proteins .
EMSAs were performed so that equal amounts of IVT PU.1 and Spi-B proteins were loaded in each reaction to compare the approximate binding affinity of these two proteins to different PU.1 binding sites .

Western blot analysis of Spi-B protein in human cell lines .

Total cell lysates from clone 13 , K562 , Jurkat , U937 , and Hela cells are also shown .
( B ) Anti-Spi-B antiserum was reacted with a Western blot of lysates obtained from Raji , CCRF-SB , RPMI 1666 , RPMI 1788 , IM-9 , WIL2-NS B cells , and H9 and Molt3 T cells ( IVT human Spi-B was used as a positive control ) .
The size of molecular mass standards are indicated at the left .
proteins other than PU.1 and Spi-B in the TNT reticulocyte lysate bound to the labeled oligonucleotides ( data not shown ) .
The binding of both IVT PU.1 and Spi-B ( which yielded a slower mobility EMSA complex ) was shown to be specific in a series of competition assays ( Fig .
8 A ) .
The wild-type cold competitor oligonucleotides competed with PU.1 and Spi-B binding activities ( lanes 2 , 5 , 8 , and 11 ) , but not competitor oligonucleotides harboring mutations in the core sequence of each PU.1 binding site ( lanes 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 ) .
The binding activity of PU.1 and Spi-B was compared for oligonucleotides derived from the c-fes promoter and the SV 40 enhancer .
The binding activity of Spi-B to the PU.1-binding site in SV40 was similar to that of PU.1 , however Spi-B appeared to bind more weakly to the c-fes promoter ( see Fig .
8 A , lanes 1 , 4 , 7 , and 10 ) .
Spi-B bound specifically and with similar affinity to PU.1 to the sites in the M-CSFR and FCyRI promoters ( Fig .
8 B , lanes 1-8 ) .

We observed strong Spi-B-binding to the PU.1 sites in B-globin , M-CSFR , FCyRI and weaker binding to the PU.1 sites in SV40 , c-fes , IgKk 3 ' , and J chain .

To determine if Spi-B in B cell nuclear extracts can also bind to a PU.1-binding site in the Igx 3 ' enhancer , a series of binding experiments were performed on extracts obtained from clone 13 human B cells .
First , antibodies specific for both PU.1 and Spi-B were tested for cross reactivity on purified proteins .
As shown in Fig .

1993 body ablated Spi-B binding but did not affect PU.1 binding ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
As expected , pre-immune sera did not affect the binding of either protein ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Having demonstrated that these antibodies are specific for either PU.1 or Spi-B , binding assays were performed on human B cell nuclear extracts .
As shown in Fig .
9 B , two specific complexes were detected using the Igx 3 ' oligonucleotide ( bands 2 and 3 in lane 1 ) .
Both of these complexes were competed by 200 ng of cold Igx 3 ' oligonucleotide while band 1 was not ( lane 2 ) .
Pre-immune sera did not affect either the specific or non-specific DNA-protein complexes ( lane 3 ) .
However , the antibody specific for Spi-B allowed the detection of a DNA-protein complex with a rapid mobility and the antibody specific for PU.1 allowed the detection of a complex with a slower mobility ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
We conclude that the addition of anti-Spi-B antibody allowed the detection of the rapidly migrating PU.1-DNA complex and the more slowly migrating Spi-B-DNA complex was revealed by the addition of the anti-PU.1 antibody .
When both Spi-B and PU.1 antibodies were added to these reactions , both PU.1- and Spi-B-binding were eliminated ( lane 6 ) .
The migration of PU.1 and Spi-B was confirmed by their co-migration with IVT PU.1 and Spi-B ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
We conclude that both PU.1 and Spi-B in clone 13 B cell nuclei are capable of binding the PU.1-binding site in the Igx 3 ' enhancer in an in vitro assay .
Spi-B Functions as a Transcriptional Activator of a B Cell-specific Gene .
- PU.1 and Pip ( PU.1 interaction partner ) form a B cell-specific heterodimeric protein complex that regulates the expression of the IgA enhancer Ey ; , ( 21 ) .
PU.1 and Pip bind to a composite element in this enhancer that is essential for enhancer activity ( 20 ) .
Furthermore , PU.1 and Pip function as mutually dependent transcriptional activators of this element when coexpressed in NIH-3T3 cells ( 21 ) .
Having shown that Spi-B can bind to multiple PU.1-binding sites in B cell-specific genes , we wanted to learn if Spi-B can also function as a transactivator of the lambda Ey , , element .
The AB element of Ey ; - , when mul-timerized and placed upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter , is transactivated by PU.1 and Pip when coexpressed in NIH-3T3 cells ( 21 ) .
As shown in Fig .
10 , neither PU.1 nor Pip transactivated the AB reporter construct ( B , TKCAT ) when expressed alone in NIH-3T3 cells .
How 211 Su et al .
ever , if both PU.1 and Pip were cotransfected with the B , TKCAT reporter DNA , chloramphenical acetyl trans-ferase ( CAT ) activity was elevated 20-30-fold .
If Spi-B and Pip were cotransfected with B , TKCAT , CAT expression was also elevated 15-fold .
Spi-B expression alone failed to elevate CAT activity ( see Fig .
10 ) .
These results show that Spi-B acts as a transcriptional activator in conjunction with Pip .
Eisenbeis et al have shown that PU.1 is required for Pip to bind to the Ey ; , element ( 21 ) .
We conclude that Spi-B can also allow Pip binding and activate transcription .
Discussion The Ets family of DNA-binding proteins have become the subject of extensive investigation as key regulators of immune response genes and cell division ( 24 ) .
The Ets family now includes ~20 members and their cellular functions and target genes are currently being analyzed .
Spi-B and PU.1 share a 67 % amino acid Ets-domain identity and 43 % overall amino acid identity ( 12 ) .
It is essential to learn if Spi-B and PU.1 have similar patterns of expression to begin to understand their respective functions in development and immune cell function .
In contrast to previous reports that Spi-B and PU.1 are coexpressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells ( 12 , 25 ) , our data clearly showed that Spi-B expression is restricted to T and B lymphocytes .
We detected no human Spi-B RNA or protein by poly-A* Northern and Western blot analysis in monocytic or erythroid cells .
We attribute the divergent results to the different probes used .
The 3'-UTR of Spi-B was used in all of our Northern blot assays as opposed to the full-length cDNA used in the study by Ray et al .
( 12 ) .
Because the nucleotide sequence similarity between Spi-B and PU.1 human cDNAs in the DNA-binding domain is 75 % ( 12 ) , we conclude that the myeloid cell expression observed in the previous report represents cross reaction with PU.1 .
Contrary to previous reports ( 12 ) , we also detected Spi-B expression in some human T cell lines at the level of both RNA and protein .
The polyclonal antiserum raised against a human Spi-B-GST fusion protein was able to Western blot , immunoprecipitate , and ablate DNA binding activity of human Spi-B specifically without any cross-reac-tivity with PU.1 .
In Western blot analysis , Spi-B protein was detected in all B cell lines and one T cell line , but not 3| % a|3| ' a|3| ' a|3s ) ' a .

- Functional analysis of the Spi-B protein .
PU.1 , Spi-B , and Pip were cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector containing the CMV 212 in any other lineages .
Spi-B protein levels in B and T cells corresponded to RNA levels ; only those cells with high Spi-B mRNA expression had detectable Spi-B protein .
Spi-B expression in both B cells and T cells appears to be tightly regulated during development .
Pro-B cells had the lowest levels of Spi-B mRNA and expression increased in pre-B and mature B cells .
The notion that mature B cells display high levels of Spi-B expression was also evident in tissue studies .
Spleen , lymph nodes , and purified splenic B cells exhibited high levels of Spi-B expression .
Spi-B expression was highest in immature CD4T CD8~ T cells and decreased during maturation to the CD4* CD8* stage of development .
These findings were consistent with human T cells and murine and human T cell lines .
The medullary promoter and enhancer .
The reporter is the B , TKCAT construct described in ( 20 ) containing four AB sites upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter .
The indicated DNAs were transiently cotransfected into NIH-3T3 cells and extracts were analyzed for CAT activity 48 h later .
The activity of B , TKCAT alone has been set at 1.0 .
The results reported are an average of four independent transfections .
Ets Protein Spi-B Is Expressed Exclusively in B Cells and T Cells staining observed for Spi-B in the murine thymus would appear to be inconsistent with high levels of Spi-B RNA in CD4~ CD8~ T cells .
However , it is not clear that the positive selection of developing thymocytes is restricted to the thymic cortex ( 26 ) .
It remains a formal possibility that CD47 CD8~ T cells reside in the medulla .
Alternatively , the medullary staining observed may represent expression in antigen presenting cells ( B cells and dendritic cells ) .
Other than the thymus , spleen , and lymph nodes , Spi-B was virtually undetectable in any other organ of either embryonic or adult mice by both poly-A* Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization .
The expression of Spi-B is clearly distinct from that of PU.1 .
In situ hybridizations of fetal and adult mouse tissues with the 5 untranslated region of PU.1 mRNA previously detected PU.1 expression in bone marrow , liver , and spleen of adults and the fetal liver of day 18.5 embryos ( 11 ) .
Further analysis showed that this was due to high levels of PU.1 in macrophages , neutrophils , mast cells , B cells , and immature erythroid cells ( 9 , 11 , 12 ) .
In contrast , Spi-B expression in murine tissues is limited to the lymphoid organs ( thymus , spleen , and lymph nodes ) and is not detected in the bone marrow or liver .
The lack of Spi-B expression in the fetal liver suggests that Spi-B is not present in immature proerythroblasts that are very abundant in the liver during days 12.5 to 16.5 of gestation .
Therefore , macrophages , neutrophils , and red blood cells which express high levels of PU.1 completely lack Spi-B .
Furthermore , Spi-B was detected in T cells where no PU.1 expression was ob-served .
Therefore , only B cells and CD4~ CD8~ T cells express high levels of both PU.1 and Spi-B .
When the binding affinities of IVT PU.1 and Spi-B were compared , Spi-B was able to bind to all published PU.1-binding sites albeit with less affinity in some cases .
Since both PU.1 and Spi-B are present in B cells , it is interesting that both were capable of binding to the 3 ' enhancer of Ig .
Although , Spi-B bound efficiently to the PU.1 binding sites of M-CSFR , FeyRI , and the scavenger receptor promoters ( 27 ) , it is unlikely to regulate these genes as it is not present in monocytes or macrophages .
It is intriguing that Spi-B can also transactivate a reporter construct containing the PU.1 binding site in the lambda chain Ey ; , enhancer .
It will be of interest to learn what Spi-B target genes exist in B cells and early T cells .
We have previously shown that PU.1 and Spi-B play nonredundant roles in B cells and T cells : gene targeting of PU.1 leads to mice lacking B cells , T cells , monocytes , and neutrophils ( 13 ) .
It will be of interest to learn how lymphocytic development and function are affected in Spi-B-deficient mice .
