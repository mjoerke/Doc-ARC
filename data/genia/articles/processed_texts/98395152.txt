A p56 `` -independent Pathway of CD2 Signaling Involves Jun Kinase* ( Received for publication , March 5 , 1998 , and in revised form , June 5 , 1998 ) Raute Sunder-Plassmannt and Ellis L. Reinherz $ § From the Laboratory of Immunobiology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 The p56 `` ** Sre family non-receptor tyrosine kinase has been shown to be critical for T lymphocyte differentiation and activation .
Hence in the absence of p56 `` ** , T cell receptor triggered activation does not occur .
We now provide evidence for a CD2-based signaling pathway which , in contrast to that of the T cell receptor , is independent of p56 `` .
CD2-mediated interleukin-2 production occurs via activation of Jun kinase in cell lines lacking p56 `` ** .
Jun kinase then facilitates the binding of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers to the AP-1 consensus site and the subsequent transcriptional activity of the interleukin-2 promoter .
These data elucidate differences between TCR and CD2 signaling pathways in the same T cells .
CD2 is a cell surface glycoprotein which is expressed on immature thymocytes and on mature T cells and NK cells ( 1-3 ) .
The ligand for human CD2 is CD58 ( LFA-3 ) , a ubiquitously expressed cell surface protein found on many cell types including antigen presenting cells ( 4 , 5 ) .
Unlike integrins such as CD11a/CD18 ( LFA-1 ) , the adhesion between CD2 and CD58 is not dependent on TCR triggering ( 6 , 7 ) .
Rather , the CD2-CD58 interaction between T cells and their cognate partners facilitates the T cell recognition process and subsequent T cell activation ( 8-10 ) .
Cross-linking of CD2 molecules by specific pairs of mAbs recognizing distinct epitopes on human CD2 initiates a signaling cascade which leads to T cell cytokine production , prolifer-ation , and cytolytic activity ( 11-13 ) .
For optimal mAb-mediated activation two antibody specificities are needed , one directed against conventional CD2 epitopes and the second against an activation-associated epitope of CD2 , termed CD2R .
The CD2R epitope has recently been mapped to the flexible linker region between the two extracellular domains of CD2 ( 14 ) .
Its appearance coincides with reorientation of the adhesion domain ( D1 ) relative to the membrane proximal domain ( D2 ) of the CD2 extracellular segment .
Such domain reorientation occurs upon * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grants AI21226 and Al19807 .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org CD58 binding to CD2 and following T cell activation ( 14 ) .
Furthermore , the CD2 interaction with CD58 regulates the responsiveness of activated human T cells to IL-12 ( 15 , 16 ) .
Hence , both IL-12-stimulated T cell proliferation and interfer-on-y production are markedly augmented by CD2 ligation .
Finally , some studies have uncovered a unique role for CD2 in the regulation of anergy ( 17 ) .
Stimulation of anergized alloreactive T cells with a combination of specific alloantigen in conjunction with CD2-CD58 co-receptor ligation reverses the an-ergic state .
In contrast , identical allostimulation but in the absence of CD2-CD58 co-ligation on T cells and allostimulators , respectively , fails to restore responsiveness ( 17 ) .
Signaling through CD2 is dependent on its cytoplasmic domain ( 8 , 18-20 ) .
Comparison of CD2 from various species shows the highest homology occurring in this segment ( 21 , 22 ) .
While the cytoplasmic domain has no intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity and no tyrosine residues which might serve as docking sites for SH2 domains upon phosphorylation ( reviewed in Refs .
23 and 24 ) , stimulation via CD2 leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins ( 25-27 ) .
For these activation events CD2 signaling requires the presence of the CD34 chain in T cells ( 27-31 ) or FceeRIy in CD16 expressing NK cells ( 82 ) .
The CD2 tail contains several proline-rich regions ( 19 ) .
Two of these ( PPPGHR ) are known to be important in inducing IL-2 production ( 33 ) .
Related proline-rich sequences bind to SH3 domains of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src family ( 23 ) .
For example , the SH3 domain of p56 `` has been shown to bind to the rat CD2 cytoplasmic tail at least in vitro ( 34 ) .
Peptides corresponding to residues 269-270 and 200-310 ( according to the human CD2 numbers ) bind to p56 ' `` *-GST fusion proteins ( 34 ) .
In vivo intracellular colocalization exper-iments , however , suggest , that p59 `` rather than p56 `` * has a predominant association with CD2 ( 35 ) , perhaps by binding through the p59 `` SH3 domain .
The activation of protein tyrosine kinases is one of the proximal steps in signaling cascades which ultimately lead to the activation of T cell effector function .
For p56 `` it has been shown that this kinase is involved in the activation of the Ras/Raf/ MAPK pathway ( 36 ) .
The function of MAPK is mani-fold .
Several studies reported that MAPK can phosphorylate and activate the transcription factors ELK , Jun , and Stat-1 and thereby participates in the regulation of gene expression ( 37 ) .
A different pathway leading to Jun activation is the Rac/JNK pathway ( 38 ) .
Recently , the Pyk2 tyrosine kinase has been described , shown to be involved in the activation of JNK ( 39 ) , and has been linked to TCR signaling via p59 `` ( 40 ) .
In this study , we have begun to dissect the differences in TCR- and CD2-based signaling pathways .
Since p56 `` * is thought to be most important at a proximal step in CD3 signaling , we investigated the role p56 `` plays in CD2 signaling .
To this end , we have employed the Jurkat variant JCaM1.6s 24249 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 24250 which lacks functional p56 `` ** and is unable to transmit TCR signals leading to IL-2 production .
We here report that although the TCR pathway is not functional in JCaM1.6s , these cells can be induced to produce IL-2 by stimulation via CD2 .
Furthermore , we present evidence for a p56 `` *-independent CD2 signal transduction pathway which uses Pyk2 and JNK and leads to the binding of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers to the AP-1 consensus site , important for initiation of IL-2 transcription .

After washing with TBS/Triton X-100 , the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL Western blotting detection reagents , Amersham International , Little Chalfont , Bucking-hamshire , United Kingdom ) and exposing the membranes to films for various time intervals .
Unspecific binding of Abs was inhibited by preincubating the membranes with blocking buffer ( TBS containing either 5 % fetal calf serum or 5 % non-fat dry milk and 10 mM NaN , ) for at least 2 h at room temperature .
Jun Kinase Assay 1 X 10 `` cells were stimulated for 80 min at 87°C with either a combination of the anti-CD2 mAbs anti-T11 , and anti-T11 , ( 1:100 ) , the anti-CD8e mAb 2AD2A2 ( 1:100 ) , or 25 ng/ml phorbol ester ( PMA ) .

After 48 h culture supernatants were harvested and examined by human IL-2 specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( Endogen Inc. , Cam bridge , MA ) .
Nuclear Extracts and EMSA 5 X 10 `` cells , unstimulated or stimulated for 4 or 6 h at 87 °C with either a combination of stimulatory anti-CD2 ( anti-T11 , plus anti-T1l1 ; , 1:100 ) or with a 1:100 dilution of anti-CD8e mAb 2AD2A2 , were incubated on ice for 15 min with 400 pl of ice-cold Buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7.9 , 10 mm KCl , 1.5 mm MgCl , , 0.5 mm DTT , 0.2 mm PMSF ) and spun at 13,000 rpm for 10 s.

RESULTS The CD2P `` CD3P `` * JCaM1.6s Cells do Not Express p56*_-JCaM1IL.6 is a Jurkat cell line variant , which lacks functional p56 `` and is unresponsive to TCR stimulation such that it fails to generate IL-2 upon anti-CD3 cross-linking ( 42 ) .
To exclude the possibility that different TCR and/or CD2 surface expression levels between Jurkat and JCaM1.6 might account for a component of the signaling defect , JCaM1L.6 cells were sorted on a FACSVantage for high co-expression of both CD2 and CD3 , equivalent to the surface expression number of these receptors found on the Jurkat line J77 ( Fig .
14 ) .
The sorted JCaM1IL.6 ( referred to as JCaM1.6s ) as well as JCaM1.6s cells , further sorted for maximal Ca `` * mobilization upon CD2 cross-linking ( termed JCaM1.6s.83 ) , were analyzed by in vifro kinase assay for p56 `` ** autophosphorylation and poly ( Glu-Tyr ) substrate phosphorylation activity .
As shown in Fig .
1B , and in contrast to J77 , JCaM1.6s does not express detectable amounts of functional p56 `` * , as judged by in vitro autophosphorylation of unstimulated , anti-CD2- , or anti-CD3e-stimulated JCaM1.6s cells .
Similarly , by in vitro kinase assay , anti-p56 `` * antibody immunoprecipitates from JCaM1.6s.83 cells do not reveal autophosphorylation activity or any enzymatic activity using the poly ( Glu-Tyr ) substrate ( data not shown ) .
CD2 Stimulation in the Absence of p56 `` Leads to a Prolonged and High Amplitude Rise in Intracellular Free Ca `` *-Although TCR cross-linking by anti-CD3e mAb or anticlono-typic mAb does not activate JCaM1L.6 cells ( 42 ) , the status of the CD2 pathway in these cells was not defined .

Analysis of [ Ca® `` * ] , ; in J77 and JCaM1.6s.83 .
A , Ca** mobilization in J77 and JCaM1.6s.33 .
Cells were loaded with Indo-1 .
Calcium flux was then analyzed on an EPICS V flow cytometer .
Where indicated , a combination of the anti-CD2 mAbs anti-T11 , plus anti-T11 , ( CD2 ) or biotinylated anti-CD8e mAb RW28C8 ( aCDSebiot ) , avidin , and Ca `` * ionophore were added sequentially .
B , tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-y1 in J77 and JCaM1.6s.88 .
Cells were either unstimulated ( - ) or stimulated with a combination of anti-CD2 mAbs or the anti-CD3e mAb 2AD2A2 and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PLC-y1 Ab .
Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 ( eft panel ) .
The stripped blots were subsequently immunoblotted with PLC-y1 Ab ( right panel ) .
The migration position of PLC-y1 is indicated by the arrows ( at ~135 kDa ) .
Ca `` * mobilization in both JCaM1.6s , the Ca** sorted JCaM1.6 s.83 and J77 following anti-CD2 or anti-CD3e stimulation .
In contrast to J77 , in which both anti-CD2 and anti-CD3e mAbs induced a long lasting and high rise in intracellular free Ca** , only anti-CD2 stimulation via the combination of anti-Tl1l ; plus anti-Tl1l ; , mAbs resulted in a substantial Ca** influx in JCaM1.6s ( data not shown ) .
After sorting , the Ca** response of JCaM1.6s.83 to anti-CD2 stimulation was equal or even higher than in J77 ( Fig .
24 ) .
Addition of biotinylated anti-CD3e mAb alone was not sufficient for Ca `` * mobilization in JCaM1L.6s ( data not shown ) or in JCaM1.6s.83 ( Fig .
2A ) .
Rather extensive cross-linking of the biotinylated anti-CD3e mAb by avidin was required to lead to a detectable Ca** transient .
This appears as a low magnitude rise in Ca** of short duration and most probably is due to the initial release of Ca** from intracellular Ca `` * stores ( Fig .
24 ) ( 41 , 44 , 45 ) .
PLC-y1 Is Tyrosine Phosphorylated and Activated by CD2 Stimulation in the Absence of p56 ' `` `` *-Given that phosphorylation and activation of PLC-y1 leads to increased phosphatidylinositol turnover and the release of Ca** from intracellular Ca* `` * stores ( 45 , 46 ) , the phosphorylation status of PLC-y1 was determined prior to and following stimulation in the J77 and JCaM1.6s cells .
In J77 , the stimulation via both CD2 and CD3e results in a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-yl as shown by anti-Tyr ( P ) Western blot analysis of anti-PLC-yl immunoprecipitations ( Fig .
2B ) .
In contrast , only activation via CD2 leads to a clear tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-y1 in JCaM1.6s ( Fig .
2B ) , whereas anti-CD3€ stimulation had a minor effect ( Fig .
2B ) .
These differences were not a consequence of gel loading of the anti-PLC-y1 immunoprecipitates as revealed by sequential Western blotting with anti-PLC-y1 antibody .

Parallel analysis was performed in the same cells following anti-CD3e mAb stimulation .
As shown in Table I , stimulation via CD2 in JCaM1.6s cells results in substantial IL-2 production , in fact to a level equivalent to 50 % of the maximal induction measured upon bypassing receptor triggering with the combination of calcium ionophore plus PMA .
In contrast , and as expected , no IL-2 production is induced by TCR cross-linking by anti-CD3e .
Data from different subclones of JCaM1.6s obtained by sequential sorting for Ca* `` mobilization following CD2 stimulation are shown ( JCaM1L.6s.81 , JCaM1.6s.82 , and JCaMIL.6s.83 ) .
The amount of IL-2 produced increases with enhanced Ca** responsiveness to CD2 stimulation .
Neither p59 `` nor ZAP7O Are Detectably Tyrosine Phosphorylated following CD2 Stimulation in JCaM1.6s-Tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of kinases such as the Src kinases p56 `` ** or p59 `` or the related tyrosine kinase ZAP70 are major events in TCR signaling and are also thought to be involved in signal transduction via CD2 ( 47 ) .
The Jurkat variant JCaM1L.6s gives us the opportunity to investigate these events in the absence of p56 `` ** .
To this end , we performed a series of Western blots with J77 and JCaM1.6s cells following anti-CD2 or anti-CD3e stimulation .
In J77 , activation via both CD2 and CD3 results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p56 `` * and the appearance of a second p60 `` * band due to the serine/ threonine phosphorylation of p56 `` ** ( 48 ) ( Fig .
3A , upper panel ) .
As expected , both ick bands are absent in the phosphotyrosine blot of p56** immunoprecipitates from JCaM1.6s .
Note that the p58 band appearing in the Tyr ( P ) blot of both J77 and JCaM1.6s is nonspecific , being unrelated to p56 `` ** .
Reanalysis of the stripped blot with anti-lck antiserum shows that these p56- and p6O-phosphorylated proteins in J77 indeed represent p56 `` ( Fig .
3A , lower panel ) .
In J77 , stimulation via the CD3 pathway leads to a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP70 , whereas activation via CD2 induces weaker but definite ZAPT7O phosphorylation ( Fig .
3B , upper panel ) .
In contrast to this observation , in JCaM1IL.6s neither CD2 nor CD3 stimulation induce the phosphorylation of ZAPT70 ( Fig .
3B , upper panel ) .
Nevertheless , similar amounts of ZAP70 were immunoprecipitated in each lane , as shown by the results of reprobing the stripped Tyr ( P ) blot with an anti-ZAP7O0 rabbit antiserum ( Fig .
3B , lower panel ) .
In both J77 and JCaM1.6s , the tyrosine phosphorylation of p59 `` increases minimally if at all after either CD2 or CD3 stimulation ( Fig .
3C , upper panel ) .
The corresponding p59 `` `` blot probed with anti-p59 `` `` antibody is shown in Fig .
3C , lower panel .
Note that the band below p59 `` is related to immuno-globulin heavy chain .

Analysis of protein-tyrosine kinase activation in J77 and JCaM1.6s.83 .
Cells were either unstimulated ( - ) or stimulated with either a combination of the anti-CD2 mAbs anti-T11 , plus anti-T1l , ( « CD2 ) or the anti-CD8e mAb 2AD2A2 ( aCD3 ) and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antisera specific for p56 `` ** , ZAP70 , or p59* `` , respectively .
Immunoprecipitates in panels A-C using the designated Abs were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 ( upper row ) .
The blots were stripped and subsequently immunoblotted with the respective Abs ( low-er row ) .
The migration positions of p56 `` ** , ZAP70 , or p59 `` are indicated by arrows .

C afyn The Ras-MAPK Pathway Is Not Functional in the Absence of p56 `` *-TCR stimulation of T cells leads to the activation of Ras resulting in the serine phosphorylation and activation of Raf , then subsequently the activation of the MAPK signaling cascade and finally to the initiation of IL-2 transcription ( 49 ) .
We investigated the activation of Raf and MAPK by Western blotting of the total lysate of either unstimulated or anti-CD2 or anti-CD3 stimulated J77 or JCaM1L.6s.53 cells with rabbit antisera specific for Raf , pMAPK , or MAPK ( Fig .
4 , A-C ) .
In J77 , both CD2 and CD3 stimulation induced the phosphorylation and molecular weight shift of Raf ( Fig .
44 ) and the subsequent phosphorylation of MAPK as shown by Western blotting with antisera specific for the phospho-MAPK ( Fig .
4B ) .
In contrast , in JCaM1.6s.83 stimulation via CD2 had no effect on either kinase ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
Surprisingly , anti-CD3 triggering in JCaM1.6s.83 led to the phosphorylation and molecular weight shift of Raf ( Fig .
44 ) but not to the functional activation of Raf as judged by the very low or absent phosphorylation of MAPK ( Fig .
4B ) .
As shown in Fig .
4C by sequential immunoblotting with a MAPK specific antiserum , the described differences were not due to different amounts of MAPK in the total lysates .
Similarly , in J77 , but not in JCaM1L.6s.983 , stimulation via either CD2 or CD3 enhanced the kinase activity of MAPK toward myelin basic protein in an in vitro kinase assay ( data not shown ) .
Additionally , CD2 stimulated IL-2 production in JCaM1.6s.83 was not inhibited by coculture with the MEK1-inhibitor PD98059 , which interferes with the MAPK pathway upstream of MAPK ( data not shown ) .
CD2 but Not CD3 Stimulation Activates Jun Kinase in the Absence of p56**-Initiation of IL-2 transcription requires the binding of certain DNA-binding proteins to specific regions within the IL-2 promoter ( 50 ) .
One of these DNA-binding elements is the AP-1 complex , which consists of homo- or heterodimers of members of the Jun and Fos protein family ( 51 ) .
In order to bind to and activate the IL-2 promoter , these dimers must assemble and the participating proteins become phosphorylated ( 51 ) .
Jun kinase ( JNK ) is involved in the serine phosphorylation and activation of Jun family members ( 52 ) .
Following CD2 stimulation in JCaM1.6s.83 cells , activation of JNK is readily detected as shown by in vitro kinase activity using a GST-Jun fusion protein substrate ( Fig .
5A ) .

JNK is activated in JCaM1.6s.83 and peripheral T cells following CD2 stimulation .
J77 and JCaM1.6s .
$ 3 cells ( A ) or freshly isolated peripheral T cells ( B ) were either unstimulated ( - ) or stimulated with either a combination of the anti-CD2 mAbs anti-T11 , plus anti-T11l , ; , ( @ « CD2 ) , the anti-CD8e mAb 2AD2A2 ( « CD3 ) , or PMA and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antiserum specific for JNK .
Subsequently , the immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of a GST-Jun fusion protein as a substrate and analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography .
The migra- tion position of the GST-Jun fusion protein is indicated by an arrow .
induced JNK activation is significantly lower than CD2 induced JNK activation in JCaM1.6s.83 , whereas both pathways activate JNK in J77 to a comparable level ( Fig .
5A ) .
The average increase of JNK activity from three independent experiments following CD2 or CD3 stimulation compared with unstimulated cells is as follows : JCaM1.6s.83 : CD2 , 2.96 + 0.8 ; CD3 , 1.44 + 0.4 ; J77 : CD2 , 1.54 + 0.2 ; CD8 , 1.72 + 0.5-fold increase ( over background unstimulated controls as determined by scanning the autoradiographs on a PhosphorImager ) .
Following CD2 Stimulation There Are Predominantly c-Jun/ c-Fos Heterodimers Binding to the AP-1 Consensus Site-The IL-2 promoter contains several binding sites for transcription factors which control IL-2 gene expression including AP-1 , NF- « B , NF-AT , and the CD28RE ( 50 , 53 ) .
In the case of the AP-1 complex , the major kinase which serine phosphorylates Jun is JNK ( 52 ) .
Since JNK is activated in JCaM1.6s.983 following CD2 stimulation ( Fig .
5A ) , it was important to determine how this activation would affect AP-1 binding .
As shown by EMSA ( elec-tromobility shift assay ) in Fig .
6A , compared with CD3 stimulation , the CD2 induced Jun kinase activity in JCaM1.6s.83 is accompanied by enhanced expression and binding of AP-1 complexes to the AP-1 consensus site .
This interaction of AP-1 proteins with the AP-1 consensus site double-stranded oligonucleotide is specific for AP-1 , as shown by competition experiments using an excess of unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
6B ) .
In J77 , on the other hand , AP-1 complex binding is similar between 24253 CD2 and CD3 stimulation ( Fig .
6A ) .
The AP-1 complex consists of homo- or heterodimers of proteins of the Jun and Fos family ( 54 ) .
It has been suggested that Jun/Fos heterodimers have a higher affinity for the AP-1 site and are more efficient in activating IL-2 gene expression ( 55 ) .
The Jun family contains at least three members , c-Jun , JunB , and JunD , while the Fos family includes c-Fos , Fral , Fra2 , and FosB ( 51 , 53 ) .
Following CD2 stimulation of JCaM1.6s.83 both homodimers and heterodimers appear to bind to the AP-1 consensus site as shown by supershift of the AP-1 proteins with the respective Abs specific for JunD , c-Jun , and c-Fos ( Fig .
7 , A and B ) .
These AP-1 complexes do not contain JunB ( data not shown ) , Fral , Fra2 , or FosB ( Fig .
7B ) .
Given that the supershift with anti-c-Jun and anti-c-Fos Abs results in a mobility shift of their respective complexes to the same position in the gel ( Fig .
7A ) , we infer that c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers are formed .
In contrast , the different mobility of the complex in the supershift with anti-JunD Ab implies that JunD/JunD homodimers are present .
CD3 stimulation is less efficient in AP-1 induction in JCaM1.6s.83 ( Fig .
6A ) .
Moreover , with anti-CD2 stimulation the AP-1 complex is supershifted to the greatest extent by anti-c-Fos mAb .
In contrast , with anti-CD3 mAb stimulation anti-JunD mAb effects the greatest shift .
These results imply that the AP-1 dimer is primarily a complex consisting of JunD/JunD homodimers following anti-CD3 stimulation ( Fig .
7A ) .
Although not shown , analysis of the other transcriptional factors involved in the regulation of IL-2 production including NF-AT , NF- « B , and Oct-1 ( 50 , 53 ) showed similar inducible nuclear protein binding profiles to the NF-AT , NF-B , or Oct-1 consensus site in JCaM1.6s.83 following CD2 or CD3 trigger-ing ; moreover , supershift analysis with Abs specific for c-Jun , JunD , or c-Fos revealed no difference in the composition of the complex binding to the NF-AT site upon either anti-CD2 or anti-CD3 stimulation .
Similarly , Abs specific for the p50 or p65 subunit of the NF- « B complex did not indicate differential effects of these stimulatory pathways as judged by supershift analysis of nuclear proteins binding to the NK- « B consensus site ( data not shown ) .
To determine if resting T cells would respond to CD2 stimulation similarly in terms of JNK activation and binding of AP-1 proteins , we performed corresponding experiments in freshly isolated peripheral T cells .
JNK is activated via both CD2 and to a lesser extent , via CD3 ( Fig .
5B ) , suggesting , as discussed below , an important role for the CD2 signaling pathway in T cell co-stimulation .
In addition , CD2 but not CD3 stimulation also efficiently leads to the activation and binding of AP-1 proteins to the AP-1 consensus site ( Fig .
6C ) .
The Tyrosine Kinase Pyk2 Is Activated following Stimulation via CD2 in the Absence of p56 `` **-Recently , Pyk2 a tyrosine kinase homologous to the focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) has been identified and linked to the JNK pathway , ( 39 ) .
Pyk2 activation , like JNK activation , requires a strong Ca** signal such as that provided by CD2 stimulation in JCaM1L.6s.53 .
We investigated the activation of Pyk2 in JeaM1.6s.83 following anti-CD2 or anti-CD3 mAb triggering by Western blot analysis and in vitro kinase assay .
Pyk2 is phosphorylated in response to both CD2 and CD3 triggering ( Fig .
8A ) , but activated only after CD2 stimulation as judged by in vitro autophosphorylation ( Fig .
8C ) .
Equivalent amounts of Pyk2 were precipitated as shown by sequential immunoblotting of the phosphotyrosine blot ( Fig .
84 ) with a Pyk2-specific rabbit antiserum ( Fig .
8B ) .
DISCUSSION In this study , we identify a CD2 signaling pathway capable of inducing IL-2 production .

Analysis of nuclear proteins binding to the AP-1 consensus site in J77 and JCaM1.6 s.83 ( A and B ) or peripheral T p56 `` -independent CD2 Signaling CD2 activation pathways ( 87 , 39 , 56 , 57 ) .
The latter is largely indistinguishable from the p56 `` **-dependent TCR pathway except that , unlike the TCR pathway , it is associated with weak CD37 and ZAPT7O0 phosphorylation .
In JCaM1.6 cells , only the p56 `` *-independent CD2 pathway is operative and , in distinction to the TCR pathway , does not involve p56 `` ** , ZAP70 , or MAPK .
Instead , CD2 triggering activates JNK followed by the binding of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers to the AP-1 consensus site .
Prior studies of TCR-based signaling showed that , in the absence of p56 `` ** , TCR triggered signals were abrogated ( 42 ) .
In contrast , as shown here , activation via CD2 in the p56 `` **-deficient Jurkat variant JCaM1.6s is not disrupted .
CD2 stimulation leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-y1 , a strong rise in intracellular free Ca** levels , and subsequent production of IL-2 .
Furthermore , CD2 signaling stimulates JNK , which leads to the activation of transcription factors of the Jun family .
Phosphorylated c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers bind to the AP-1 consensus site , leading to the induction of IL-2 transcription .
Although CD2 signaling in T cells requires the presence of the CD3Z chain ( 27-31 ) , the precise molecular basis by which cell surface immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif containing TCR subunits permit CD2 signaling remains uncer-tain .
The functional involvement of the CD34 chain in T cells , and the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover ( 46 , 58 ) shared by TCR and CD2 pathways indicates the usage of a common pathway following CD2 and TCR signaling .
Indeed , a complex involving CD2 , p59 `` , and has been shown to exist in T lymphocytes ( 35 ) .
Nevertheless , certain differences among the pathways are also evident .
For example , T cell activation via CD2 , in contrast to via the TCR , is not associated with Syk phosphorylation and involves minimal if any phosphorylation of ZAP-70 or CD3 ( 25 , 27 , 59 ) .
Additionally , the phosphorylation kinetics and cellular substrates are distinct in these two pathways ( 25 , 27 ) .
Recently , the Tec family kinase ITK has been shown to be activated upon stimulation via CD2 ( 60 ) .
This ITK activation requires the presence of functional p56 `` but is independent of the surface expression of CDSL ( 60 ) .
Moreover , CD2 plays important roles in reversing anergy and augmenting IL-12 responsiveness ; neither activities are TCR regulated ( 15 , 17 ) .
CD2 signaling is mediated by its proline-rich intracytoplasmic domain to which SH3 domains of non-receptor kinases can bind ( 23 , 33 ) .
Recent studies indicate that p56 `` ** and p59 `` are able to bind to CD2 and hence are implicated in CD2 signaling ( 84 , 35 , 61 ) .
p56 `` ** is present in thymocytes and mature T cells and is involved in signaling via the TCR ( 62 ) .
T cells from mice bearing a disrupted p56 `` gene ( 63 ) , mutant Jurkat cells lacking functional p56hk ( JCaM1I.6 ) ( 42 ) , or CTLL-2 cells that lack p56 `` expression show defects in TCR-mediated responses ( 62 ) .
Upon TCR stimulation p56 `` * associates with and phosphorylates ZAPT7O and it has been speculated that ZAPT7O may , therefore be , at least in part , responsible for bringing p56'** into the signaling complex ( 64 , 65 ) .
Notwithstanding , other experiments employing mutant immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif sequences demonstrate that p56 `` ** can cells ( C ) .

The tyrosine kinase ZAP70 is a key molecule in TCR signaling , but can in some systems be replaced by p72 Syk ( 67 , 68 ) .
We and others ( 25 , 59 ) have shown that following CD2 stimulation ZAP70 is only weakly if at all tyrosine phosphorylated or activated in J77 .

The position of Pyk2 at ~120 kDa is indicated by an arrow .
C Pyk2 - » som dlt ms observed ( Fig .
3B and data not shown ) .
Furthermore , JCaM1.6 and its parental Jurkat line E6 are deficient in Syk expression ( 69 ) and there is no evidence for the presence or phosphorylation of Syk in JCaM1L.6s ( data not shown ) .
We , therefore , conclude that in JCaM1.6s , CD2-triggered IL-2 production does not involve tyrosine kinases of the Syk family .
Events downstream of protein-tyrosine kinase activation include the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-y1 , which then leads to an increase in intracellular free Ca** concentrations via the generation of inositol trisphosphate ( 70 ) .
In p56** expressing T cells , TCR stimulation is followed by an initial high transient Ca** `` peak and a lower amplitude but sustained plateau phase ( 41 , 44 , 46 ) .
The initial rise of Ca** is caused by the inositol trisphosphate-mediated release of Ca** from the endoplasmatic reticulum ( 45 ) but is not sufficient for proliferation or IL-2 gene expression ( 41 , 71 ) .
Rather the prolonged elevation of intracellular Ca* `` * due to the Ca** influx from extracellular sources is the critical component of the Ca** signal ( 41 , 71 ) .
The mechanism by which Ca** enters T cells from extracellular stores in not well understood ( 72 ) .
However , in JCaM1.6s , anti-CD3 stimulation leads only to a short duration Ca** increase in the absence of a sustained high Ca** rise , suggesting that p56 `` * is involved , either directly or indirectly , in TCR-mediated Ca** influx from extracellular stores .
Inositol trisphosphate is generated by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate by PLC-y1 .
As reported previously , JCaM1.6 cells fail to show production of inositol phosphates after TCR triggering ( 73 ) .
Consistent with this finding , PLC-y1 , whose catalytic activity is strongly enhanced by tyrosine phosphorylation ( 74 ) , is only weakly phosphorylated upon TCR triggering in JCaM1L.6s ( Fig .
2B ) .
In contrast to CD3 stimulation , CD2 stimulation leads to a clear tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-y1 ( Fig .
2B ) and to a strong and long lasting rise in intracellular free Ca** levels in JCaM1.6s ( Fig .
24 ) .
Although Hubert et al .
( 59 ) failed to detect anti-CD2 mAb induced PLCy phosphorylation in JCaM1 cells , a difference in the surface expression of CD3 and CD2 on JCaM1 versus the sorted JCaM1.6s cells herein may explain this discrepancy .
TCR stimulation events downstream of ZAP7O0 include She phosphorylation , the activation of Sos , and subsequently of Ras leading to the activation of the MAPK pathway and finally to IL-2 production ( 56 ) .
This tyrosine kinase activation following TCR engagement has been shown to be dependent on the presence of functional p56 `` ( 36 ) .
Surprisingly , therefore , we observed that although the MAPK pathway is non-functional after CD2 stimulation as well as CD3 stimulation in JCaM1.6s.83 , the ability of CD2 mAbs to induce IL-2 produc- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 24256 Fic .

Signal transduction via CD2 .
p56 `` **-dependent and independent activation pathways following CD2 stimulation are based on prior results ( 87 , 39 , 56 , 57 , 75 ) and the current studies .
In JCaM1L.6 , only the p56** independent signal transduction pathway is functional leading via JNK and subsequent c-Jun activation to the binding of the AP-1 complex to the IL-2 promoter and the initiation of IL-2 transcription .
Both pathways apparently activate PLC-y1 leading to the generation of a rise in intracellular free Ca** , resulting in a calmodulin-dependent activation of calcineurin .
The latter dephosphory-lates NF-AT resulting in its nuclear translocation .
tion was not compromised .
These observations strongly indicate that CD2 stimulation can activate signaling pathways distinct from CD3 stimulation .
Pyk2 was recently identified as a tyrosine kinase , which is involved in Jun kinase activation and associates with the adapter protein Grb2 ( 39 ) .
By forming a complex containing Pyk2 and the GDP-GTP exchange factor Vav ( 75 ) , Grb2 can link Pyk2 to the GTP-binding protein Rac , whose activation finally leads to the activation of JNK ( 57 ) .
In our study , we show that , following both CD2 and CD3 stimulation , Pyk2 is tyrosine phosphorylated in JCaM1.6s.83 cells , but only CD2 triggering activates Pyk2 enzymatically , providing a possible link to a stimulation pathway which leads to JNK activation .
JNK is important in the regulation of the IL-2 promoter since JNK activation correlates with IL-2 production ( 88 , 51 , 52 , 76 ) .
IL-2 promoter regulation involves several transcription factors some of which are JNK sensitive ( 50 , 51 , 77-80 ) .
The AP-1 transcription factor can bind to the IL-2 promoter either directly at the AP-1 site ( 81 , 82 ) or together with NF-AT or Oct at their respective binding sites ( 83-86 ) .
The AP-1 complex is composed of proteins of the Jun and Fos family ( 51 ) .
JNK , a Ca* `` *-sensitive serine/threonine kinase of the MAP kinase fam-ily , is critically involved in the post-transcriptional stimulation of AP-1 activity by phosphorylating the activation domain of c-Jun .
Su et al .
( 38 ) reported that two signals are necessary to efficiently activate JNK , including different combinations of A23187 , TPA , anti-CD3 mAb , or anti-CD28 mAb .
This dual activation requirement and the reported Ca** sensitivity distinguishes JNK from other members of the MAPK/JNK family .
The involvement of CD2 stimulation in the activation of JNK has not yet been previously investigated .
In both J77 and JCaM1.6s.983 , JNK is activated following stimulation via CD2 ( Fig .
5A ) , suggesting that CD2 utilizes a p56** independent pathway which leads to the activation of JNK .
The strong and long lasting Ca** mobilization observed in JCaM1.6s.83 following CD2 stimulation might sensitize JNK to p56 `` ** independent signals involved in JNK activation ( 38 ) .
Furthermore , in the absence of p56 `` ** , anti-CD2 stimulation is accompanied by the enhanced binding of the c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers to the consensus AP-1 sequence leading to IL-2 production .
A previous study performed by stimulating Jurkat cells with superantigen pulsed HLA-DR transfectants revealed differences in the composition of the NF-AT-AP-1 complexes following costimulation with either -- ~4e @ __- @ _ tan Near ] [ Ne 3 fossng [ ara ] [ oot | ___ ) p56 `` -independent CD2 Signaling SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION VIA CD2 CD2 CD2 ploy ver R PIP , ZN ca pag - IPs ®GEEB£ | } ® Y PKC < - Cat [ Be ] + CALMODULIN } caLciNEuRrIN NFATP x `` JNK NF-AT SRE | [ nee | | ar net IL-2 Promoter __ *======== > » > IL ' 2 LFA-3 or B7 ( 87 ) .
These differences were due to the dimerization of JunD with different members of the Fos family ( Fral and Fra2 ) , indicating a selective induction of certain nuclear factors depending on the costimulatory pathway .
In our current study , we observed no significant difference in the binding of nuclear proteins to the NF-AT consensus site upon anti-CD2 versus anti-CD3 stimulated JCaM1.6s.83 .
Since the MAPK pathway , known to be involved in Fos transcription , is non-functional in JCaM1.6 , the lack of Fral and Fra2 Fos family members complexed to the AP-1 site in JCaM1.6s.83 is perhaps not unexpected .
In addition , the coordinate action of TCR engagement and the B7 versus LFA-3 costimulatory signal could differentially induce Fos family proteins .
In the study by Parra et al .
( 87 ) , AP-1 and NF-kB complexes binding to their respective site in the IL-2 promoter revealed no differences after either type of costimulation .
By stimulation via CD2 alone , we found not only JunD but also c-Jun induced and heterodimerizing with c-Fos in JCaM1.6s.83 ( Fig .
7A ) .
Since the AP-1 site in the IL-2 promoter is a relatively low affinity site ( 83 ) , Fos-Jun heterodimers , which are more effective in DNA binding and transactivation ( 55 ) , might be required for optimal activity .
Additionally , c-Jun and c-Fos in contrast to JunB , Fral , and Fra2 are more efficient transactivators ( 55 , 88 , 89 ) .
The function of JunD in IL-2 gene transcription is not defined yet .
Anergy , a state of T cell unresponsiveness to antigenic chal-lenge , which is induced by TCR stimulation in the absence of the CD28 costimulatory signal ( 90 ) , is accompanied by preferential induction of the inhibitory p50-p50 NF- « B homodimer and a reduced binding of AP-1 to the IL-2 promoter ( 91 , 92 ) .
Recently , it was shown in an alloreactive system that alloantigen stimulation induced T cell anergy can be reversed in those cells after culture in IL-2 for 7 days only by costimulation with CD58 ( 17 ) .
This ability of CD2 stimulation to reverse anergy is unique and distinct from costimulatory molecules such as CD28 ( 17 ) .
Our observation that CD2 stimulation can activate JNK and leads to the induction and binding of c-Jun/ c-Fos heterodimers to the AP-1 site might provide a basis for the role CD2 plays in regulating anergy .
This possibly remains to be investigated in anergized T cells .
The data presented in this study provide evidence for a CD2 signaling pathway distinct from that of the TCR and capable of inducing IL-2 production in the absence of p56 `` ** .
This CD2 stimulation induced signaling cascade does not involve either 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog p56 `` -independent CD2 Signaling 24257 p56 `` or ZAP70 , key molecules in T cell activation via the TCR , and can also be initiated by CD2 triggering in peripheral T cells .
CD2 activates Pyk2 and undoubtedly other kinases , and subsequently stimulates JNK independent of p56 `` ** .
The precise definition of the intermediate steps in this activation cascade will now be of interest to determine .
