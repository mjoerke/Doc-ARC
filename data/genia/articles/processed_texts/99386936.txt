Differential Effects of Lipopolysaccharide and Tumor Necrosis Factor on Monocytic IxB Kinase Signalsome Activation and IxB Proteolysis* ( Received for publication , April 15 , 1999 ) Claudia Fischer } , Sharon Page # , Marion Weber , Tamara Eisele , Dieter Neumeier , and Korbinian Brand§ From the Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry , Klinikumrechts der Isar , Technical University Munich , Ismaninger Strasse 22 , 81675 Munich , Germany The inflammatory - mediators - lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and tumor necrosis factor ( INF ) are potent activators of NF- « B .
This study compared the effect of these stimuli on endogenous IxB kinase ( IKK ) signalsome activation and IxB phosphorylation/proteolysis in human monocytic cells and investigated the role of the signalsome proteins IKK-a , IKK-B , NF-B-inducing kinase ( NIK ) , IKK-y ( NF-B essential modulator ) , and IKK complex-associated protein .
Kinase assays showed that TNF elicited a rapid but short-lived induction of IKK activity with a 3-fold greater effect on IKK- « than on IKK-B , peaking at 5 min .
In contrast , LPS predominantly stimulated IKK- $ activity , which slowly increased , peaking at 30 min .
A second peak was observed at a later time point following LPS stimulation , which consisted of both IKK-a « and - activity .
The endogenous levels of the signalsome components were unaffected by stimulation .
Furthermore , our studies showed association of the IKK- « /f heterodimer with NIK , IxB-a « and -e in unstimulated cells .
Exposure to LPS or TNF led to differential patterns of IxB-a « and IxB-e disappearance from and re-assembly with the signalsome , whereas IKK-a , IKK-§ , and NIK remained complex-associated .
NIK can not phosphorylate IxB-a directly , but it appears to be a functionally important subunit , because mutated NIK inhibited stimulus-induced « B-dependent transcription more effectively than mutated IKK-a « or -B. Overexpression of IKK complex-associated protein inhibited stimulus-me-diated transcription , whereas NF-KB essential modulator enhanced it .
The understanding of LPS- and TNF-induced signaling may allow the development of specific strategies to treat sepsis-associated disease .
Bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , `` a glycolipid membrane component , accounts for many of the cellular responses to Gram-negative infections , including sepsis and the development of septic shock ( 1 ) .

The interaction of LPS with cells of , for example , the monocytic lineage appears to be especially important because subsequent cellular activation results in the release of highly active proinflammatory molecules , such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and interleukin ( IL ) -1 , which in turn mediate systemic effects ( 2 , 3 ) .
One of the key regulators of LPS-induced , as well as TNF- and IL-1f-induced , gene expression at the interface between signal transduction and transcription is the transcription factor NF- « B ( 4-6 ) .
There is an ever-increasing body of evidence that suggests that NF- « B/Rel plays an important role in gene regulation during inflammatory and immune reactions in a variety of disease settings ( 7-11 ) .
NF- « B regulatory sequences have been found in promoters or enhancers of numerous genes , e.g .
coding for the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1 ; the chemo-kines IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ; several adhesion molecules , including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ; and the procoagulatory protein tissue factor ( 5 , 12-15 ) .
The prototypic NF- « B dimer consists of the subunits p65 ( RelA ) and p50 , although other sub-units , such as c-Rel , RelB , and p52 have been identified ( 5 ) .
These dimeric NF- « B complexes are present in the cytosol in an inactive state bound to inhibitory proteins , collectively termed ( 5 , 14 , 15 ) .
Several IB proteins have been identified , including IkB-a ( 16 , 17 ) , IxB-B ( 18 ) , and the more recently cloned IxB-e ( 19 ) .
A variety of agents such as microbial pathogens ( for example , LPS ) , as well as inflammatory or lympho-proliferative cytokines , including TNF and IL-1 , induce the activation of NF-kB ( 5 , 6 , 14 ) .
This is mediated by a network of kinases leading to the phosphorylation of I « B , which is subsequently degraded in an ubiquitin-dependent step by the proteasome , a multicatalytic high molecular weight protease system ( 16 , 20-22 ) .
The removal of the inhibitor IxB allows the translocation of the thus activated NF- « B dimer into the nucleus .
The signaling mechanisms that lead to the phosphorylation of I « B , and thereby NF- « B activation , are only partly understood and characterized for TNF , IL-1 $ , and LPS ( 23-27 ) .
A high molecular weight IB kinase ( IKK ) complex , also named the signalsome , has recently been identified , and it is postulated to represent a bona fide IxB kinase ( 28-32 ) .
Several kinase-active components of this complex have been cloned , namely IKK- « , IKK-8 , and NF- « B-inducing kinase ( NIK ) ( 28-33 ) .
Furthermore , two adaptor or scaffold proteins have been found , IKK-y/NF- « B essential modulator ( NEMO ) /IKK-associ-ated protein 1 ( 34-86 ) and IKK complex-associated protein ( IKAP ) ( 37 ) , which have been suggested to stabilize the high molecular weight complex and/or regulate the kinase activity .
Additional kinases , such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/ 24625 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 24626 extracellular-regulated kinase kinase kinase-1 ( 38 ) or mitogen-activated ribosomal S6 protein kinase ( pp90 `` ** ) ( 89 ) , may assemble with the signalsome following activation of cells by certain stimuli .
For example , activation of NF- « B by TNF appears to involve several upstream signaling proteins , including TRAF2 and RIP , which in turn activate NIK , thereby initiating a signaling pathway that results in IxB phosphorylation ( 23-25 ) .
It should be mentioned that the functionality of these IKK signalsome components has been mostly established under relatively unphysiological overexpression conditions in easy to handle cell lines , such as Hela , 293 , or Chinese hamster ovary B ( 28-32 ) .
TNF and were almost exclusively used as activators of these systems ( 28-82 ) , although LPS has recently been reported to activate IKK ( 27 ) .
The regulation of expression and activation of endogenous signalsome components in cell types and conditions relevant for inflammation has not been investigated in great detail .
The present study was therefore designed to compare the effect of TNF and LPS on endogenous IKK signalsome activation and IxB phosphorylation/ proteolysis in monocytic cells .
In addition , we investigated the involvement of IKK-a , IKK-§ and NIK , as well as the adaptor proteins IKK-y ( NEMO ) and IKAP , in these signaling cascades .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture Conditions and Reagents-THP-1 human monocytic cells ( Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen , Braunschweig , Germany ) were maintained in suspension in RPMI 1640 ( Glutamax-1 , low endotoxin , Seromed , Berlin , Germany ) containing 7 % fetal calf serum ( Myoclone super plus , low endotoxin , BioWhittaker , Walkersville , MD ) , 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin ( Life Technologies , Inc. , Eggenstein , Germany ) as described ( 40 ) .
For the experiments , the cells were plated at a density of 3 X 10° cells/well in six-well culture dishes .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from blood samples of normal donors by the Ficoll-Hypaque method as described ( 41 ) .
Monocytes were isolated from mononuclear cells by adherence to achieve a purity of approximately 90 % as determined by flow cytometry .
The adherent monocytes were cultured overnight in the same medium as THP-1 cells with 10 % fetal calf serum before the experiment was started .
LPS ( Escherichia coli 0111 : B4 ) and TNF were purchased from Sigma .
Endotoxin contamination was screened by the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay ( BioWhittaker ) , and only reagents with an endotoxin content of < 10 pg/ml were used in the experiments .
A potential toxicity of the cell culture conditions applied was monitored by cell morphology and count , trypan blue dye exclusion , and the WST-1 cell toxicity test ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals , Mannheim , Germany ) .
Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis-Cy-tosolic extracts were isolated as described earlier ( 42 ) .
Electrophoresis was performed with 12.5 % polyacrylamide gels ( 0.1 % SDS ) as described previously ( 40 ) .
The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the wet blotting technique .
After transfer , the membranes were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl-termi-nal domains of the inhibitors IxB- @ , -B ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Heidelberg , Germany ) , and -e ( a kind gift from Prof. N. Rice , NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , National Institutes of Health , Frederick , MD ) , against the kinases IKK- @ , -B , or NIK ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , as well as the scaffold protein IKK-y ( using an antibody raised against the mouse homologue of human IKK-y , namely NEMO , a gift from Prof. Alain Israél and co-workers , Institut Pasteur , Paris , France ) , or with a monoclonal antibody against a-actin ( Sigma ) .
In some experiments , an antibody recognizing only the form of phosphorylated at Ser-82 was used ( Calbiochem , Bad Soden , Germany ) .
This incubation was followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) .
The protein was visualized on x-ray film using the Western blot chemiluminescent reagent plus ( NEN Life Science Products ) .
The protein size was confirmed by molecular weight standards ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Braunschweig , and Bio-Rad ) .
Immunoprecipitation-Cytosolic extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) ( 85 , 48 ) in either TNT buffer ( 200 mM NaCl ; 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 ; 1 % Triton X-100 ; 1 mM dithiothreitol ; 0.5 um 4- ( 2-aminoethyl ) -benzenesulfonyl fluoride ; and 0.75 ug/ml each leupeptin , antipain , aprotinin , pepstatin A , and chymostatin ; Sigma ) or TN buffer Differential Effects of LPS and TNF on the IKK Complex ( as TNT but without Triton X-100 ) .
Unspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 1 ug of normal rabbit IgG ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and 25 ul of 6 % protein A-agarose ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by immunoprecipitation for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 ug of anti-kinase antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and 25 ul of 6 % protein A-agarose .
After washing three times with TNT/TN buffer as appropriate and three times with kinase buffer ( 20 mm HEPES , pH 8.0 ; 10 mM MgC1 , ; 100 um Na , VO , ; 20 mM B-glycerophosphate ; 50 mM NaCl ; 2 mM dithiothreitol ; 0.5 uM 4- ( Z2-aminoethyl ) -benzenesulfonyl fluoride ; and 0.75 ug/ml each leupeptin , antipain , aprotinin , pepstatin A , and chymostatin ) , the precipitated proteins were either analyzed by Western blot or kinase assay .
Kinase Assay-IP was carried out as described above and followed by the kinase assay ( 35 , 48 ) .
The kinase reaction was performed in kinase buffer for 80 min at 30 °C in the presence of 5 uCi of P ] ATP ( NEN Life Science Products ) and 500 ng of the substrate GST-IxB- @ ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Proteins were analyzed on 12.5 % polyacrylamide gels ( 0.1 % SDS ) , dried , and visualized by autoradiography .
Transfection of THP-1 Cells-The following reporter plasmids were utilized in transfection studies : 3x « B.luci , a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid containing three copies of a prototypic ( 5'-GGGACTTTCC-3 ' ) kB site ( 42 ) ; TNFkop.luci , comprising 1108 base pairs of the TNF promoter region ( 42 ) ; and pGL2-IL-8 , containing 420 base pairs of the IL-8 promoter region ( 44 ) .
Overexpression plasmids used in our studies included IKK- @ , IKK-8 , NIK ( wild type and mutated forms ) , IKAP ( all gifts from Tularik Inc. , South San Francisco , CA ) , NEMO , IxB-e ( wild type and mutated ) , IxB-8 ( gifts from Prof. Alain Israél and co-workers , Institut Pasteur ) , and antisense IKK-a « ( a gift from Prof. Michael Karin , University of California-San Diego , La Jolla , CA ) .
ReCMV ( Invitrogen , Groningen , Netherlands ) containing no insert was used as a negative control in the overexpression experiments .
These plasmids , either alone or in combination , were transiently co-transfected with a constitutively active Renilla luciferase control plasmid , pRLtk ( Promega , Mannheim , Germany ) , into THP-1 cells using a DEAE-dextran-based protocol ( 13 , 44 ) .
After transfection , cells were plated out at a density of 2 X 10° cells/3 ml of RPMI medium with 7 % fetal calf serum in a six-well plate and incubated for 2 days .
After this time , the cells were stimulated for 5 h with either TNF or LPS .
Subsequent to stimulation , the cells were lysed , and the luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system ( Promega ) .
The results are expressed as firefly luciferase relative light units divided by the values in relative light units obtained for the Renilla luciferase .
Pulse-Chase-Pulse-chase experiments were carried out as described ( 40 ) .
Briefly , THP-1 cells were washed in complete medium ( RPMI 1640 medium ) without Met/Cys ( BioWhittaker ) and resuspended in this medium at a density of 8 X 10° cells/ml .
After incubation in a 12.5-cm `` culture flask at 37 °C and 5 % CO , for 30 min , 100 Ci of [ °°S ] Met/Cys ( NEN Life Science Products ) was added , followed by a labeling time of 3 h. The cells were then washed in the above-mentioned medium plus 500 uM Met/Cys ( Boehringer Ingelheim , Ingelheim , Germany ) , resuspended in this medium , and plated out at a density of 3 X 10°cells/well in a 12-well plate .
The plate was returned to the incubator , and extracts were made at various times later .
Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described ( 42 ) , except that the nuclei were incubated in Buffer B ( 0.02 m HEPES , pH 7.0 , 0.1 1 KCl , 0.1 m NaCl , 5 mM dithio-threitol , 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 20 % glycerol , and 0.75 ug/ml each leupeptin , antipain , aprotinin , pepstatin A , chymostatin , Sigma ) plus 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 for 30 min on ice prior to disruption by drawing through a narrow pipette tip .
Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were assayed for cpm .
IP of equal volumes of protein was carried out using an anti-IKK- @ or -B antibody , and the resulting protein precipitate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
Autoradiographs of the vacuum-dried gels were analyzed den-sitometrically , the values were corrected for the cpm loaded , and the half-life was calculated for each protein .
RESULTS Differential Activation of IKK-a and -B-Initial experiments were performed to assess potential selective effects of LPS and TNF on endogenous kinase-active signalsome subunits in human monocytic cells .
Kinase assays were carried out to monitor the activity of IKK-a @ and -B following incubation with these stimuli .
Cytosolic extracts from THP-1 cells were subjected to IP with an anti-kinase antibody and the ability of the precipitated proteins to phosphorylate GST-IxB-a « in vitro was analyzed .

Differential activation of endogenous IKK-a and -B by TNF and LPS in monocytic cells .
A , cytosolic extracts from THP-1 cells incubated with TNF ( 1.6 ng/m ! )
were subjected to IP using TNT buffer with either IKK-a « or -B antibodies as indicated .
A kinase assay was performed using the substrate GST-IxB-a « , and the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
*°P-Phosphorylated ( circled P ) GST-IxB-a is shown by the arrow .
B , THP-1 cells were incubated with LPS ( 1 for the times indicated , and IP followed by kinase assay for IKK- @ and -B activity was performed as in A .
C , comparison between LPS- and TNF-induced IKK activity .
Experiments were performed as described in A and B , and the peak activities ( TNF , 5 min ; LPS , 30 min ) were analyzed .
Representative films were scanned and quantified densitometrically .
Induction above base line was calcu-lated , and the results are depicted .
D , kinase assays were performed as described in B , and the two peak activities of IKK after LPS stimulus ( 30 and 75 min ) were analyzed as in C. the TNT buffer used for IP , disrupts the integrity of the signalsome complex ( data not shown ; see also Fig .
3 ) , allowing us to distinguish between IKK-a and - activity .
TNF stimulation ( 1.6 ng/ml ) elicited a rapid but rather short-lived effect , with a maximum response from both IKK- « and -B at 5 min of incubation ( Fig .
1A ) , although the IKK-a @ activity was greater than that of IKK-B .
TNF-induced IKK-a activity then decreased sharply after 20 min and had reached near base-line levels by 75 min .
A similar pattern was observed for IKK-8 ( Fig .
1A and data not shown ) .
On the other hand , LPS stimulation ( 1 pg/ml ) had a major effect on IKK-B activity , which slowly increased and peaked at 30 min ( Fig .
1B ) , whereas an almost negligible increase in the activity of IKK-a was observed at this time point .
We also detected a second peak of IKK activity , comprising both IKK-a and -B activation , following LPS stimulation at 75 min ( Fig .
1B and see below ) .

Activation of IKK ex vivo in human monocytes .
Adherent human monocytes were stimulated with TNF ( 1.6 ng/m !
l ) ( A ) or LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) ( B ) for the times indicated .
IP of cytosolic extracts with either IKK-a or -B antibodies in TNT buffer was carried out as shown , and kinase assays with GST-I « B-a « as substrate were performed as in Fig .
1 .
*°P-Phosphorylated GST-IxB-a @ ( circled P ) is shown by the arrows .
The peak IKK activities induced by TNF ( at 5 min ) or LPS ( at 30 and 75 min ) were analyzed by densitometry and compared .
In general , the activation of IKK by TNF was much more pronounced than that mediated by LPS at the time points of peak activation ( Fig .
1C ) .
The effect of TNF on IKK- @ was 3-fold greater than that on IKK-B at 5 min of incubation , whereas LPS almost exclusively activated IKK-B after a 30-min stimulation period ( Fig .
1 , C and D ) .
However , at 75 min of incubation , LPS appeared to induce both IKK-a and - activity , to approximately the same extent ( Fig .
1D ) .
Stimulus-induced IKK-a and -B Activity ex Vivo in Human Monocytes-Kinase assays were also performed with cytosolic extracts from human adherent monocytes following either TNF ( 1.6 ng/ml ) or LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) stimulation .
The experiments showed that TNF rapidly induced IKK activity > IKK- $ 8 ) with an early peak at 5 min ( Fig .
24 ) .
Similar to the effect seen in THP-1 cells , LPS exposure led to a slow increase in predominantly IKK-fB activity with a peak at 30 min ( Fig .
2B ) .
The Role of NIK in IxB Phosphorylation-Next , we tested whether monocytic endogenous NIK , another kinase-active signalsome component , can itself directly phosphorylate IxB- « substrate .
For this purpose , IP with an antibody raised against NIK was performed under different conditions .
As already mentioned , the presence or absence of Triton X-100 in the IP buffer is important with respect to the integrity of the precipitated complex .
TN buffer ( without detergent ) or TNT buffer ( 1 % Triton X-100 ) was used in the IP step following LPS or TNF stimulation of THP-1 cells .
The subsequent kinase assay showed that in the absence of detergent , a strong kinase activity following LPS stimulation was detected ( Fig .
3 , TN ) .
However , when detergent was present and the precipitated protein was almost exclusively NIK alone ( data not shown ) , no phosphorylation of the substrate was observed ( Fig .
3 , TNT ) .
A similar result was seen when TNF was used as the stimulus ( Fig .
3 ) .
It should be noted that in some experiments , the peak activity following exposure to TNF was observed at an earlier time point than 5 min .
The results suggest that in monocytic cells , NIK itself can not phosphorylate the substrate IxB-a .
The activity seen in the absence of Triton X-100 must be due to kinases that have co-precipitated with NIK in the signalsome complex .

NIK does not directly phosphorylate IxB- « in monocytic cells .
Cytosolic extracts from LPS- or THP-1 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-NIK antibody in the presence ( TNT ) or absence ( TN ) of the detergent Triton X-100 .

TNF ( min ) < GST- IxB-a- @ ® Level of the Signalsome Components in Monocytic Cells-Before further analysis of the signalsome complex ( see below ) , we wanted to establish the presence and level of endogenous IxB kinase-active components and associated subunits of the signalsome in monocytic cells .
An additional aim was to examine whether the endogenous concentration of these molecules is changed following incubation with potent monocyte activators , such as LPS and TNF .
For this purpose , THP-1 monocytic cells were incubated with LPS or TNF , and the level of IKK- @ , -B , and -y ( NEMO ) , as well as of NIK , was determined by Western blot analysis .
In unstimulated monocytic cells , we detected a significant endogenous level of all the above-mentioned signaling proteins ( IKK-a , IKK-B , NIK , and IKK-y ) , as shown in Fig .
4 .
Following treatment with LPS or TNF , the levels of IKK- « and IKK-B ( Fig .
4A and data not shown ) , as well as NIK and IKK-y ( Fig .
4B and data not shown ) , were not significantly altered , suggesting a tight regulation of these components in monocytes .
As a control , the concentration of « -actin was also monitored ; its level was not influenced by any of the incubation conditions used ( Fig .
4A ) .
Northern blotting for the mRNA coding for IKK-a and -B revealed only a weak signal in both stimulated and unstimulated cells ( data not shown ) .
Because this low level of mRNA contrasts with the relatively high constitutive expression of the proteins in this system , we decided to investigate the half-lives of these kinases by pulse-chase analysis .
Using this technique the half-life of endogenous IKK- « and - was found to be 12.8 + 0.1 h ( n = 2 ) and 12.7 *+ 0.1 h ( n = 2 ) , respectively , which indicates a relatively high stability of both signaling molecules in monocytic cells .
Analysis of the Signalsome Complex-The association of the endogenous kinase-active signalsome components and NIK ) and the inhibitor proteins IxB- @ and -e was investigated in monocytic cells under various conditions .
Initially , IP using a monoclonal antibody raised against IKK- @ was performed on cytosolic extracts , followed by Western blot analysis of the co-precipitated proteins .
In the absence of detergent in the IP buffer , we saw the complex components IKK-f and NIK , as well as bound IxB-a and -e , co-precipitated by the anti-IKK-a antibody from unstimulated cell extracts ( Fig .
5 and data not shown ) , whereas in the presence of Triton X-100 , only the directly precipitated protein was observed ( data not shown ) .
This demonstrated the occurrence of IKK-w/ $ B heterodimers in monocytic cells and showed that these subunits are already associated with NIK as well as IxB- @ and -e in unstimulated cells .
The complex precipitated in the absence of detergent , as far as we were able to ascertain , did not alter in IKK-a , IKK-B , or NIK composition throughout treatment with Differential Effects of LPS and TNF on the IKK Complex All 30 60 90 120 150 LPS ( min ) I I !

Level of endogenous signalsome components in monocytic cells .
THP-1 cells were treated with LPS , and cytosolic extracts were examined by Western blot for the presence of IKK-a and -B ( A ) or NIK and IKK-y ( B ) proteins .
« -Actin levels were assayed as a loading control ; in A , a representative blot for the experiment is shown .
LPS or TNF ( Fig .
5 and data not shown ) .
A different pattern was observed for IkB-a , which , following LPS stimulation , slowly disappeared from the complex over 60 min , being undetectable at this time , and then gradually reassociated ( Fig .
5A ) .
This agrees with the phosphorylation and proteolysis pattern that we observed in parallel studies ( Fig .
5A ) .
In contrast , TNF stimulation led to a clear phosphorylation of IxB- « after 1 min of incubation ( Fig .
5B ) .
This phosphorylated form remained bound to the complex until 5 min , at which time it disappeared .
The inhibitor protein then reassembled with the signalsome complex by 45 min , in its unphosphorylated form .
The other inhibitory protein , I « B-e , was also initially associated with the signalsome complex and , after TNF stimulation , gradually disappeared .
It was not found to reassociate , which is presumably due to the limited time frame studied here ( see also Fig .
8 ) .
Overexpression of Wild Type or Mutated Kinase-active Signalsome Componenis-Next , we examined the effect of the kinase-active proteins IKK- « and as well as NIK , on LPS-and TNF-induced « B-dependent transcription .
We transfected THP-1 cells with overexpression vectors for both wild type and mutated kinases together with luciferase reporter plasmids .
Initially , transfection efficiency was assessed by Western blotting of cytosolic extracts from kinase-transfected THP-1 cells , using an antibody raised against the Flag tag present on the overexpressed proteins .
This confirmed that the protein was being overexpressed at equal levels in our system and that the control vector without a tagged overexpression protein showed no signal ( data not shown ) .
The effect of both wild type and mutated IKK- « @ , -B , and NIK was investigated using TNF and LPS as stimuli and 3x « B.luci as a reporter plasmid .
The mutated , kinase-inactive proteins were all able to reduce LPS- or TNF-induced « B-dependent transcription below the level seen with the wild type proteins , with an effectiveness of IKK-a < IKK-§ < NIK ( Fig .
6A ) .
NIK wild type alone , in the absence of a stimulus , was also capable of causing an increase in « B-dependent transcription ( 4.7-fold over the base-line level of transcription observed in the presence of mutated , kinase-inactive NIK ) .
Neither wild type IKK-a nor -B was able to affect transcription in the absence of a stimulus .
In addition , antisense IKK-a , when overexpressed in THP-1 cells , was able to inhibit LPS-induced « B-dependent , as well as TNF promoter-dependent , transcription ( data not 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Differential Effects of LPS and TNF on the IKK Complex A __ o 15 so 4s so 7s so 105 120 | LPS ( min ) iP + we Izzlinmp -~ _ 0 15 30 45 60 75 90105120135 | LPS ( min ) [ mfd ws we E- .

shown ) , in contrast to the sense ( i.e .
wild type IKK- @ ) .
The control vector ReCMV , which contains no inserted DNA , had no effect on transcription .
Double transfections , in which either wild type or mutated IKK-a and -B were transfected together into THP-1 cells , showed an increase in the effectiveness of the mutated kinases in inhibition of the LPS- and TNF-induced « B-dependent transcription ( Fig .
6B ) .
Triple transfections , with all three kinases transfected at the same time into cells , showed that an inhibition of the LPS stimulus of 60 % was achieved when all kinases were mutated and inactive ( Fig .
6C ) .
Mutation of just one of the kinases led to a partial inhibition of the stimulus , with inactive IKK-a having the weakest effect and mutated NIK having an effect almost as strong as that seen when all three kinases were inactive .
Transfection of Nonkinase Members of the Signalsome Com-plex-To obtain some insight into possible functional aspects of the scaffold proteins IKAP and IKK-y ( NEMO ) , transfection experiments were carried out .
Interestingly , overexpression of IKAP or NEMO in THP-1 cells resulted in two contrasting effects .
IKAP overexpression led to a partial inhibition of both LPS- and TNF-induced « B-dependent transcription , seen with either 3x « B.luci or IL-8 and TNF promoter-dependent con 24629 structs ( Fig .
7A and data not shown ) .
Both LPS- and TNF induced 3x « B.luci or IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription were inhibited by approximately 50 % .
IKAP alone influenced « B-dependent transcription to a certain degree , leading to an increase of 2.2-fold above base-line .
NEMO , however , caused a slight rise ( 1.6-fold ) in the level of xB-dependent transcription , over and above the effect seen with LPS and TNF alone ( Fig .
7B ) .
In the absence of external stimuli , NEMO-transfected cells also showed a small increase ( 1.8-fold ) in transcriptional activity over the base-line levels .
IxB Proteolysis and Overexpression of IxB-e and -B-To investigate whether the differential activities of IKK after LPS or TNF stimulation affect the proteolysis and resynthesis of the recently cloned IxB-e , as well as IxB- $ , we studied the kinetics of I « B degradation and subsequent resynthesis following either LPS or TNF stimulation .
Maximal degradation of I « B-e occurs relatively late following LPS exposure , after a 90-min stimulus ( Fig .
8A ) .
This inhibitory protein was rapidly resynthesized , reaching base-line expression levels by 120 min of incubation .
A similar degradation pattern was found for IxB-B after LPS challenge , but in contrast to IxB-e , this was not followed by resynthesis of the I « B-B protein , at least within the time frame studied here ( Fig .
8A ) .
IxB-e was degraded much more rapidly by incubation with TNF , with an almost complete degradation achieved by 10 min ( Fig .
8B ) , followed by a relatively long lag phase and thereafter resynthesis of the protein by 75 min .
IxB-B also quickly underwent proteolysis after TNF stimulation , with no significant resynthesis up to 120 min later ( Fig .
8B ) .
We also examined the effect of overexpression of the inhibitory proteins IxB-e and - in THP-1 cells to investigate whether these proteins are involved in shutdown of NF-KB activity .
A contrasting result was seen between the two proteins .
Transfection of an IxB-e wild type vector led to a reduction in stimulus intensity of « B-dependent transcription following incubation with LPS or TNF ( Fig .
8C ) .
The mutated form of IxB-e , which can not be phosphorylated , also caused inhibition of the above-mentioned stimulus-induced transcription and was in fact even more effective than the wild type molecule ( Fig .
8C ) .
Both 3x « B.luci and IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription was similarly affected .
In contrast , IxB-B overexpression led to a reinforcement , rather than an inhibition , of the LPS- and TNF-induced stimulation for all the plasmids examined ( Fig .
8D ) .
The signal intensity was more markedly increased ( 3-fold ) in than in IL-8 promoter construct-trans-fected cells .
overexpression alone , in the absence of external stimuli , led to a marginal rise in the level of transcription , more clearly visible in IL-8 promoter construct-transfected cells than in those transfected with 3x « B.luci .
DISCUSSION Both LPS and TNF belong to the most potent activators of NF-KB in cells of the monocytic lineage ( 5 , 6 , 14 ) .
However , the signaling cascades leading to NF-kB activation induced by these stimuli appear to differ markedly ( 24 , 26 , 43 ) .
The present paper elucidates the effects of LPS , as well as TNF , on endogenous monocytic IKK signalsome activation and subsequent phosphorylation/proteolysis of the IB inhibitory proteins .
Our study reveals that a completely different signalsome activation pattern results from incubation of cells with these two highly effective stimulating molecules .
Incubation of human monocytic cells with LPS predominantly activated IKK- $ in our kinase experiments using IxB- « as a substrate with a slow increase leading to a peak of activation at 30 min .
At this time point , only a negligible activation of IKK-a by LPS was observed .
In addition , a second IKK activation peak was seen at a later time point ( 75 min ) , which 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 24630 Differential Effects of LPS and TNF on the IKK Complex A IKK- a IKK- B NIK 25 14 4 = W Wita type Wild type WWiid type 2 Mutated `` i C ] Mutated | , C ) Mutated i 15 08 X .

consisted of both IKK-B and IKK-a « activity .
This may be caused by continuous stimulation induced by the presence of LPS in the medium and/or autocrine mechanisms .
A recent report describes the activation of IKK by LPS in THP-1 cells ( but does not distinguish between IKK- « and -B ) with a maximum at 60 min ( 27 ) .
In these experiments , the exclusive dominant-negative expression of but not IKK-a , partially inhibited LPS-induced transcriptional activity ( 27 ) .
This is in contrast to our study , as well as recently published results ( 26 ) , in which the expression of both dominant-negative IKK-B and IKK- @ exerted inhibitory effects .
The differences between these studies ( peak of activation and effect of dominant-negative IKK-a ) could be due to differences in THP-1 sublines/cell types ( 13 ) .
When these data are taken together , our study indicates that IKK- $ is the major target of LPS signaling but also suggests a modest activation of IKK-a , especially at a later time point .
In contrast , TNF preferentially activated IKK-a with a dra-matic , very early peak of activation at 5 min .
Furthermore , a significant effect of TNF on activity was observed that was approximately 3-fold lower than that on IKK-a but showed a similar time course of activation .
No second peak at a later time point was observed in the presence of TNF .
A TNF-induced early peak of IKK activity was also observed in Hela cells , when the whole signalsome complex was isolated and used for kinase assays , as well as in IKK-a and IKK-B overexpression studies ( 28 , 29 , 32 ) .
In the latter experiments , equal effects of TNF and IL-1 on IKK-a @ and IKK-B were observed ( 28 ) , which contrasts with our TNF studies and may potentially be due to the fact that the functionality of overexpressed proteins does not precisely mirror the endogenous situation .
Our studies suggest that endogenous NIK , another kinase-active signalsome component ( 30 , 31 ) , is not able to directly phosphorylate IxB- « following LPS or TNF exposure of mono 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Differential Effects of LPS and TNF on the IKK Complex A 0 30 60 90 120 150 _ LPS ( min ) 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 105120135 LPS ( min } B 0 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 75 90 TNF ( min ) tp C 04 ay | < InBee 0 10 20 30 45 60 75 90 105 120 TNF ( min } ro m % B 15+ 0 ILB .

IxB proteolysis and overexpression of IxB-e and -B .

B , the presence of these proteins was also investigated following TNF stimulation .
C , wild type or mutated IxB-e overexpression plasmids were transfected into THP-1 cells , and the effect on B-dependent , as well as IL-8 promoter-dependent , transcription following incubation with LPS ( L ) , TNF ( T `` ) or in the absence of stimulus ( C ) was analyzed as described in Fig .

cytic cells .
Nevertheless , transfection studies indicate that NIK may be a functionally important subunit of the complex because dominant-negative expression of NIK appeared to be even slightly more effective than that of IKK-a @ or IKK-B in inhibiting LPS-induced , as well as TNF -induced , « B-dependent transcriptional activity .
This may result from the more upstream orientation of NIK imposing a tight negative regulation over IKK ( 37 ) .
Recent overexpression studies in 293 cells demonstrate the association of NIK with IKK- @ and , to a lesser extent , with IKK-B ( 31 ) and the specific phosphorylation of Ser-176 of IKK- « by the NIK molecule ( 45 ) .
In unstimulated monocytic cells , the endogenous signalsome contained IKK-w @ /IKK-B heterodimers that appeared to be associated with NIK , IkB-a , IxB-e , and presumably additional proteins not examined in this study ( see also Ref .
37 ) .
Recently , it has been concluded from transfection experiments that heterodimers represent the most active IKK kinase subconfigura-tion ( 31 ) .
Following stimulation with LPS/TNF , the IKK proteins , as well as NIK , remained in the complex , whereas IxB- « disappeared and at a later time point reassociated , a finding completely consistent with the stimulus-specific patterns of 24631 IxB proteolysis and resynthesis observed in parallel experiments .
A similar stimulus-induced release from the signalsome multimolecule was found for IxB-e. Interestingly , a recent study suggested that overexpressed IKK-a associates with IkB-a bound to p65-p50 , and it was proposed that phosphorylation induces the release of the inhibitor protein ( 30 ) .
A reverse approach demonstrated that mutations of Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IxB- « ( preventing phosphorylation ) increased the signalsome association of the IB protein ( 31 ) .
At the structural level , it has been suggested that the kinase and leucine zipper domains of IKK-8 may be required for interaction with ( 31 ) .
This association pattern could also imply fine-tuned direct interactions between the high molecular weight complex signalsome , responsible for phosphorylation ( 28-32 ) , and the proteasome , representing the degrading machinery ( 21 , 22 ) .
Another as yet unanswered question concerns the role of the kinase-inactive adaptor/scaffold proteins IKAP ( 37 ) and IKK-y ( NEMO and IKK associated protein 1 ) ( 34-86 ) in signalsome-mediated signal transduction .
In our studies , overexpression of IKAP in monocytic cells partially reduced LPS-stimulated , as well as TNF-stimulated , transcriptional activity .
In 293 cells , an increased level of IKAP has been shown to inhibit TNF- and IL-1-induced « B-dependent transcription , and it was suggested that it may inhibit cytokine signaling by titrating out each individual component of the IKK signalsome ( 87 ) , eg .
a higher level of IKAP may compete with kinase-active molecules .
In contrast , the presence of exogenous NEMO enhanced both LPS- and TNF-induced transcription in our experiments .
Recently , it has been shown that IKK associated protein 1 preferentially interacts with IKK-B ( 36 ) , and it has been suggested that this protein provides a scaffold upon which IKK-B-contain-ing complexes could be localized to the upstream components of the NF- « B activation cascade ( 34-36 ) .
Alternatively , a higher level of IKK-y in the signalsome may lead to an increased recruitment of the IB substrate or proteasome particles , which could also be a reason for the observed enhancement .
One technical issue should be discussed , and that is the reliability of transfection/overexpression studies .
In our experiments , dominant-negative expression of IKK-a , IKK-f , or NIK in monocytic THP-1 cells led only to a partial inhibition of both LPS- and TNF -activated « B-dependent transcription , with triple transfection most effective , in contrast to earlier studies using Hela or 293 cells demonstrating a much more profound effect ( 26 , 28 , 31 , 45 ) .
In addition , using the transfection strat-egies , we were not able to confirm the LPS- or TNF-induced differential pattern of IKK- « and activation seen in our kinase assays , which we consider a more clean and direct approach .
Furthermore , we were not successful in establishing a direct effect of wild type IKK- « and IKK-B on « kB-regulated transcriptional activity observed under the cell culture and overexpression conditions already mentioned ( 28 , 31 ) .
One reason for these discrepancies may be a technical problem , which is the low transfection efficiency using monocytic cells .
Another reason could be that overexpression of proteins may create unphysiological conditions ( 46 ) .
For example , exogenously added IKK may form nonphysiological dimers/complexes , which may display lower or dysregulated kinase activities ( 31 , 47 ) .
Therefore , endogenous IKK-w/ $ B heterodimers could overcome at least partially the effect of the specifically overexpressed proteins in monocytic cells and bias our results such that we did not achieve a clear cut kinase activation pattern .
When these data are taken together , LPS appears to only modestly but preferentially stimulate IKK-B activity over a longer time interval , whereas the effect of TNF on the IKK kinase-active molecules ( IKK-a > IKK- $ ) is marked and rapid but appears to be rather limited .
Because the effect of LPS on 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 24632 IKK activity was much weaker than that of TNF , one could argue that the IKK pathway represents just one of several parallel signaling pathways induced by LPS leading to NF- « B activation .
In fact , LPS is known to initiate signal transduction cascades resulting in a spray-like activation of a network of kinases , G-proteins , cyclic nucleotide metabolizing enzymes , lipid second messengers , and ion channels , some of which even may be not related to NF- « B ( 2 ) .
Furthermore , additional kinases may be involved in LPS-mediated IxB phosphorylation ( 39 , 48 , 49 ) .
On the other hand , a modest but continuous activation of IKK by LPS may prove essentially as effective as the rapid but short-lived activation of IKK seen following TNF challenge of cells .
In this context , it should be noted that LPS or TNF led to a different proteolysis pattern of I « B-a « , -B , and -e in our work , which incidentally completely agreed with the IKK activation pattern , but finally led under both activation conditions to a marked removal of the inhibitory proteins .
One important issue that has to be addressed in the future is the question of why LPS induces slow motion signaling , whereas TNF activates a rapid motion pathway , and what signaling molecules are involved .
In any case , the differential IKK activation pattern following LPS or TNF stimulation may provide therapeutical avenues : for example , the specific inhibition of IKK-B would block LPS effects responsible for numerous deleterious effects in the organism but only partially inhibit TNF to a level potentially still required and sufficient for proper immune responses .
Therefore , a deeper molecular understanding of how LPS and TNF affect cellular pathways may allow new approaches to improve the fatal outcome of the sepsis-associated wasting disease .
