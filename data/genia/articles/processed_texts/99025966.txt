Interaction of Sickle Erythrocytes With Endothelial Cells in the Presence of Endothelial Cell Conditioned Medium Induces Oxidant Stress Leading to Transendothelial Migration of Monocytes By Chand Sultana , Yamin Shen , Vinod Rattan , Cage Johnson , and Vijay K. Kalra The abnormal adherence of sickle red blood cells ( SS RBC ) to endothelial cells has been thought to contribute to vascular occlusion , a major cause of morbidity in sickle cell disease ( SCD ) .
We determined whether the interaction of SS RBC with cultured endothelial cells induced cellular oxidant stress that would culminate in expression of cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) involved in the adhesion and diapedesis of monocytes and the adherence of SS reticulocytes .
We showed that the interaction of SS RBC at 2 % concentration in the presence of multimers of von Willebrand factor ( vW1 ) , derived from endothelial cell-derived conditioned medium ( E-CM ) with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , resulted in a fivefold increased formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ) and activation of the transcription factor NF-kB , both indicators of cellular oxidant stress .
Normal RBC show none of these phenomena .
The oxidant stress-induced signaling resulted in an increased surface expression of a subset of CAMs , ICAM-1 , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 in HUVEC .
The addition of oxygen NDOTHELIAL CELLS forming the lining of the blood vessels throughout the vasculature come in continuous contact with circulating blood cells and plasma components .
Under normal physiological conditions , blood cells are , at most , loosely attached to endothelial cells as in the marginal pools of polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMN ) .
However , under other conditions , blood cells do adhere to localized vascular sites as part of hemostasis .
For example , PMN adhere to endothelium before they migrate to sites of extravascular infection or acute inflammation , and platelets accumulate at injured sites in the vessels .
These are normal processes required for host defense and hemostasis , respectively . ``
However , sickle red blood cells ( SS RBC ) from patients with sickle cell anemia exhibit increased adherence to cultured endothelial cells under both static and flow conditions* `` and the extent of adhesion in vitro appears to parallel the clinical severity of vaso-occlusive events in sickle cell disease ( SCD ) . ``
Such abnormal adhesion of SS RBC , when compared with the behavior of normal RBC , is thought to be important in the mechanism of vaso-occlusion , a hallmark of sickle cell crises . ``
In addition to adhesion events , the interaction of SS RBC with endothelium may cause From the Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , and Medicine , University of Southern California , School of Medicine , Los Angeles , CA .

0006-4971/98/9210-0009 $ 3.00/0 3924 radical scavenger enzymes ( catalase , superoxide dismutase ) and antioxidant ( probucol ) inhibited these events .
Additionally , preincubation of HUVEC with a synthetic peptide Arg-Gly-Asp ( RGD ) that prevents vWf-mediated adhesion of SS RBC reduced the surface expression of VCAM-1 and NF-kB activation .
Furthermore , SS RBC-induced oxidant stress resulted in a twofold increase in the transendothelial migration of both monocyte-like HL-60 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes , and approximately a sixfold increase in platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 ( PECAM-1 ) phosphorylation , each of which was blocked by protein kinase C inhibitor and antioxidants .
These results suggest that the adherence/ contact of SS RBC to endothelial cells in large vessel can generate enhanced oxidant stress leading to increased adhesion and diapedesis of monocytes , as well as heightened adherence of SS reticulocytes , indicating that injury/activation of endothelium can contribute to vaso-occlusion in SCD .

endothelial injury , culminating in the dislodgment of cells from vessel walls or the altering of endothelium characteristics , such as vascular tone . ``
'' It has been shown that the genes coding for vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) ' `` are induced as a result of interaction of SS RBC with endothelium , which may affect vascular tone and thus affect blood flow . ``
Because SS RBC generate excessive amounts of reactive oxygen metabolites due to the presence of unstable hemoglobin S and the spontaneous autoxidation of iron in heme , '* `` `` we hypothesized that the adherence of SS RBC , mediated by multimers of von Willebrand factor ( vW1 ) , to cultured endothelial cells might induce cellular oxidant stress , ie , generation of reactive oxygen intermediates capable of activating transcription factor , NF-kB . '
'' Numerous studies'* `` `` have shown that diverse agents , eg , inflammatory cytokines , oxidative stress ( hydrogen peroxide ) , and endotoxins activate NF-kB by distinct intracellular pathways that involve reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as a common messenger .
The activation of NF-kB is capable of altering gene expression of several genes including those for the cell-adhesion molecules ( ICAM-1 , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 ) . '
5 `` `` As a consequence of the increased expression of cell-adhesion molecules , the adherence of PMN and monocytes to vascular endothelium might be heightened .
Moreover , VCAM-1 acts as a receptor for the « 4B ; integrin present on SS reticulocytes `` thus promoting the additional adherence of SS RBC .
As a consequence of the additional adherence of SS RBC , PMN , and monocytes , blood flow could be further obstructed , which may contribute to the recurrent vaso-occlusive events in SCD .
To test our hypothesis , we examined whether the adhesion of SS RBC to cultured endothelial cells generated ROS , and if so , whether it caused activation of transcription factor NF-kB .
As a consequence of activation of NF-kB , we expect to find increased expression of VCAM-1 , which would allow adherence of sickle reticulocytes via the o4B ; integrin .
The activation of NF-kB would also lead to increased expression of CAMs , Blood , Vol 92 , No 10 ( November 15 ) , 1998 : pp 3924-3935 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

SS RBC-INDUCED OXIDANT STRESS IN ENDOTHELIUM which participate in the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells .
Thus , adhesion of both reticulocytes and monocytes to the vascular endothelium could cause further obstruction and participate in vaso-occlusive phenomenon .
Our results show that the interaction of SS RBC in the presence of multimers of vWf , derived from endothelial cell-derived conditioned medium ( E-CM ) with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , indeed results in an increased formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ) and the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB , both indices of cellular oxidant stress .
'* ' `` * `` Furthermore , we show for the first time that the oxidant stress induced by the adhesion of SS RBC causes a several-fold increase in the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 , a multifunctional cell-junction molecule , `` > `` `` and importantly , a concomitant increase in the migration of both monocyte-like HL-60 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes ( PBM ) across the endothelial cell monolayer .
In SCD , the accumulation of monocytes in large vessels , eg , cerebral vasculature in response to the oxidant stress generated by the adhesion of SS RBC , may contribute to the stroke syndrome .

RESULTS Effect of SS RBC on the induction of oxidant stress in HUVEC .
- We determined whether the adhesion of SS RBC could induce oxidant stress .
As shown in Table 1 , SS RBC were 3927 2.5 times more adherent to the endothelial cells than were those from normal individuals .
Additionally , SS RBC in the presence of multimers of vWf ( conditioned medium from endothelial cells , E-CM ) exhibited threefold more adherence than in the absence of E-CM , as has been previously observed . ``
The augmented adherence of SS RBC in the presence of multimers of vWf ( E-CM ) was observed to be optimal with 100 ug protein/mL of E-CM and inhibited by antibody to vWf .
As shown in Table 1 , incubation of SS RBC at a concentration approximating a hematocrit of 2 % ( vol/vol ) with HUVEC , in the absence and presence of E-CM led to approximately three-and fivefold increased formation of TBARS , respectively , relative to HUVEC coincubated with normal ( AA ) RBC with and without E-CM .
The adhesion of SS RBC to endothelial cells mediated by multimeric vWF ( E-CM ) appears to play a role in oxidant stress ( lipid peroxide ) induction because the addition of the peptide Lys-Tyr-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser ( KYRGDS ) containing the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD ) sequence motif , which prevents multimeric vWf-mediated adhesion of SS RBC to HUVEC , `` > > ° completely inhibited the formation of TBARS , over and above that of SS RBC alone , whereas a variant peptide Ala-Gly-Asp-Val ( AGDV ) did not prevent either the adhesion of SS RBC or the formation of TBARS .
Both catalase ( 200 U/mL ) and superoxide dismutase ( 200 U/mL ) together , scavengers of free radicals , `` `` completely abrogated SS RBC + E-CM-induced TBARS formation in HUVEC , relative to HUVEC incubated with SS RBC alone .
Moreover , in the presence of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) and catalase the formation of lipid peroxides ( TBARS ) in HUVEC was observed to be 50 % reduced below the level of HUVEC incubated with SS RBC alone .
It is pertinent to note that incubation of SS RBC ( 2 % Het ) alone for 2 to 4 hours did not show the formation of TBARS because its formation was below the detection limit of the assay .
However , at a higher concentration ( 10 % ) of SS RBC , the amount of MDA formed by SS RBC alone was 8.78 + 0.62 nmole MDA/g hemoglobin ( n = 4 ) ( data not shown ) in agreement with previous studies . ``
Overall , these results indicate that adhesion of SS RBC to endothelial cells , mediated by multimers of vWf ( E-CM ) , generates greater amounts ( approxi-mately twofold ) of ROS over and above that observed with SS RBC alone interaction with endothelial cells .
SS RBC-induced activation of NF-kB activity in HUVEC .
We measured , in HUVEC nuclear extracts , the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB , another index of cellular oxidant stress .
! ``
As shown in Fig 1 , nuclear extracts prepared from HUVEC that had been incubated with SS RBC and E-CM , showed a time-dependent increase in NF-kB activity .
The maximal activation of NF-kB activity occurred at 1 hour , followed by a decrease at 2 hours and 4 hours .
As shown in Fig 1 , gel-shift binding assays in the presence of excess competing oligonucleotide resulted in a decrease in NF-kB activity , indicating specificity of interaction of DNA binding proteins with an NF-kB nucleotide sequence .
There was minimal activation of NF-kB activity when HUVEC were incubated with AA RBC in the presence of E-CM at the 1-hour time point ( Fig 1 ) , the optimal time period for activation of NF-kB with SS RBC plus E-CM .
As shown in Fig 2 , incubation of normal red blood cells ( AA RBC ) with HUVEC for a prolonged time ( 4 hours ) with or without E-CM did not significantly increase From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

HUVEC were incubated with RBC ( 2 % Hct ) in the presence of E-CM ( 100 pg/mL ) for 60 minutes , unless otherwise indicated in the presence and absence of inhibitors ( genistein , 25 g/mL ; KYRGDS , 100 pmol/L ; HFPA , 10 pmol/L ; and probucol , 50 wmol/L ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated with a double-stranded `` P-labeled NF-kB oligonucleotide probe .
Where indicated , excess cold competitor oligonucleotide was added to the nuclear extracts and incubated for 10 minutes before addition of radiolabeled DNA probe .
The data are representative of four independent experiments .
NE-kB activity over that of untreated HUVEC .
Furthermore , SS RBC incubation with HUVEC alone for 1 hour augmented by twofold activation of NF-kB activity .
However , incubation of SS RBC with HUVEC in the presence of E-CM increased by twofold the NF-kB activity over and above that of HUVEC incubated with SS RBC alone .
This data is qualitatively similar to the formation of TBARS in HUVEC by SS RBC in the absence and presence of E-CM ( Table 1 ) .
As shown in Fig 2 , incubation of HUVEC with E-CM alone did not affect basal NE-kB activity .
As shown in Fig 1 , SS RBC + E-CM induced activation of NE-kB was inhibited by a tyrosine kinse inhibitor , genistein `` ; and by antioxidant , probucol . ``
Other antioxidants , pyrroli-dinedithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) and vitamin E , also inhibited NE-kB activity ( data not shown ) .
Additionally , the activation of NE-kB in HUVEC nuclear extracts induced by SS RBC in the presence of E-CM was inhibited when HUVEC were preincu- bated with the synthetic peptide KYRGDS ( Fig 1 ) .
We have recently observed that tert-butylhydroperoxide , an inducer of oxidant stress , causes activation of the transcription factor NE-kB as a result of activation of p21 `` ** 4 ; thus we examined whether the NF-kB activation that was induced by SS RBC could be blocked by an inhibitor of p21'* activity .
As shown in Fig 1 , treatment of HUVEC with a p21 `` farnesyltransferase inhibitor `` ( « -hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid , HFPA ) , before the addition of SS RBC + E-CM inhibited NF-kB activity .
These results suggest that interaction of SS RBC with HUVEC , in the presence of multimers of vWf ( E-CM ) , causes a greater activation of NF-kB over and above that observed with SS RBC alone .
Thus , we chose to study the effect of adhesion of SS RBC , mediated by multimers of vWf ( E-CM ) , on the cellular signaling in HUVEC leading to the expression of CAMs and migration of monocytes across the endothelial cell monolayer in the following studies .

SS RBC-INDUCED OXIDANT STRESS IN ENDOTHELIUM Adherence of SS RBC to HUVEC leads to the surface expression of adhesion molecules .
As shown in Fig 3A , incubation of SS RBC ( 2 % hematocrit ) in the presence of vWf ( E-CM ) , with HUVEC resulted in a time-dependent increase in the surface expression of ICAM-1 , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 , as determined by ELISA .
The surface expression of ICAM-1 continued to increase above basal level ( untreated HUVEC ) at 12 hours and remained unchanged up to 24 hours .
Similarly , the surface expression of VCAM-1 was also optimal at 12 hours .
However , E-selectin surface expression , though it increased up to 8 hours in response to incubation with SS RBC , then declined to almost basal level by 12 to 24 hours .
Moreover , there was no affect on the surface expression of constitutively expressed ICAM-2 by SS RBC and E-CM ( data not shown ) .

Does adhesion of SS RBC or soluble factor released from SS RBC mediate the surface expression of CAMs ?
- As shown in Fig 3C , E-CM alone ( vWf ) , in the absence of SS RBC , did not induce VCAM-1 surface expression .
However , E-CM induced the surface expression of VCAM-1 in the presence of SS RBC .
Moreover , addition of the KYRGDS peptide ( 100 umol/L ) , which blocks vWf-mediated adhesion of SS RBC , `` reduced by approximately 50 % the surface expression of VCAM-1 , whereas the variant-peptide AGDV failed to inhibit VCAM-1 expression induced by SS RBC and E-CM .

3930 basal level of oxidative stress generated by SS RBC alone . ``
It is pertinent to note that the addition of synthetic peptides KYRGDS and AGDV directly to HUVEC , in the absence of SS RBC , or the SS RBC-conditioned media derived from the incubation of 1 mL of SS RBC ( 20 % Het ) for 2 hours , failed to induce the surface expression of VCAM-1 ( data not shown ) , indicating that binding of small peptide ligands or components present in the medium from SS RBC to the putative receptor on HUVEC was not sufficient to induce VCAM-1 expression .
Treatment of HUVEC with LPS ( 100 ng/mL ) as a positive control exhibited an increase in VCAM-1 expression over and above the level observed with SS RBC in the presence of E-CM ( Fig 3C ) .
The increase in VCAM-1 surface expression in HUVEC in response to SS RBC E-CM was not due to the contaminating effect of endotoxin because addition of polymyxin B ( 5 ug/mL ) , an inhibitor of endotoxin , did not reduce VCAM-1 expression ( Fig 3C ) .
These studies indicate that adherence of SS RBC mediated by vWf augments VCAM-1 expression , whereas inhibition of adherence by RGD peptide reduces the VCAM-1 expression .
Effect of antioxidants on the surface expression of VCAM-1 in HUVEC .
Because probucol inhibited the activation of NE-kB activity in HUVEC in response to the interaction of SS RBC +E-CM , we examined the effect of antioxidants on the surface expression of VCAM-1 .
As shown in Fig 3D , pretreatment of HUVEC with the antioxidants probucol ( 50 umol/L ) and vitamin E ( 25 umol/L ) reduced by ~90 % VCAM-1 expression induced by SS RBC plus E-CM .
Moreover , the addition of SOD and catalase , completely abrogated the VCAM-1 expression over and above that observed with SS RBC alone .
The possibility of the involvement of the glutathione redox cycle in the cellular oxidant stress generated by the interaction of SS RBC with HUVEC was examined through the use of agents , that affect intracellular glutathione levels . ``
Elevation of intracellular glutathione ( GSH ) levels by preincubation of HUVEC with the cell-permeable glutathione ester ( GSH-ethyl ester ) for 24 hours completely inhibited SS RBC , plus E-CM induced VCAM-1 expression ( Fig 3D ) .
Conversely , pretreatment of HUVEC with butathionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) , an agent that prevents GSH synthesis , augmented VCAM-1 expression by ~40 % over and above that observed with SS RBC plus E-CM ( Fig 3D ) .
Effect of SS RBC -induced oxidant stress on the transendothelial migration of monocytes .
In our recent studies , `` we observed that oxidant stress induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide promoted the transendothelial migration of monocytes ; thus we examined whether ROS generated by HUVEC in response to the adhesion of SS RBC also mediated the transendothelial migration of monocytes .
First , we examined the effect of adhesion of SS RBC on the transendothelial migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells .
To study the migration of monocyte-like cells in the presence of RBC , we used fluorescent-labeled HL-60 cells , so as to distinguish the migration of monocytes from that of RBC across the endothelial cell monolayer .
The migration of fluorescently labeled monocyte-like HL-60 cells was monitored by fluorescence microscopy .
As shown in Fig 4A , the addition of SS RBC ( hematocrit 2 % ) with E-CM to confluent monolayers of HUVEC cultured in Transwell chambers resulted in an approximately twofold increase in the number of monocyte-like HL-60 cells migrating across the SULTANA ET AL endothelial cell monolayer at 2 and 4 hours posttreatment with SS RBC .
Normal ( AA ) RBC in the presence of E-CM failed to increase the migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells above basal level ( Fig 4A ) .
As previously observed `` with 15-HPETE-induced transendothelial migration of monocytes , an antibody to PECAM-1 inhibited by 70 % + 11 % the SS RBC-induced migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells across HUVEC monolayers ( Fig 4B ) , whereas a control antibody to ICAM-2 had no effect on transendothelial migration ( Fig 4B ) .
Our previous studies `` `` showed that 15-HPETE induced the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and , concomitant with it , increased the transendothelial migration of monocytes ; thus we investigated whether the transendothelial migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells induced by SS RBC was linked to PECAM-1 phosphorylation .
As shown in Fig 4B , pretreatment of HUVEC with the PKC inhibitor GF-109203X ( 20 nmol/L ) `` for 30 minutes , followed by incubation with SS RBC and E-CM , resulted in an approximate 60 % decrease in the transendothelial migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells at the 2-hour time point .
As predicted , augmentation of PECAM-1 phosphorylation with the protein phosphatase inhibitor Calyculin A ( 2 nmol/L ) * `` increased by ~70 % ( P < .001 ) the transendothelial migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells , relative to endothelial cells incubated with SS RBC and E-CM ( Fig 4B ) .
These studies indicate that there may be a direct or causal relationship between phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and transendothelial migration of monocytes .
Treatment of HUVEC with antioxidant probucol ( 50 umol/L ) reduced by ~70 % the migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells ( Fig 4C ) .
As shown in Fig 4C , pretreatment of HUVEC with GSH-ethylester , which causes elevation of intracellular GSH levels , `` `` for 24 hours reduced by ~90 % the migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells .
However , treatment of HUVEC with BSO to prevent GSH synthesis* `` increased by 50 % the migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells induced by SS RBC plus E-CM ( Fig 4C ) .
Effect of SS RBC on transendothelial migration of human PBM .
- Because our studies showed that incubation of HUVEC with SS RBC in presence of E-CM increased transendothelial migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells ( a transformed cell line ) ; it was of interest to examine whether freshly isolated monocytes from human peripheral blood exhibited similar migration characteristics .
As shown in Fig 4D , incubation of HUVEC with SS RBC plus E-CM resulted in twofold increase in the migration of human PBM at 2-hour time point as was observed for monocyte-like HL-60 cells .
Additionally , antibody to PECAM-1 inhibited the migration of monocytes by ~80 % ( Fig 4D ) .
However , control antibody to ICAM-2 had no affect ( data not shown ) .
The addition of KYRGDS , but not a variant peptide AGDV , blocked the transendothelial migration of human PBM by 70 % .
Phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in HUVEC induced by SS RBC .
_ As shown in Fig 5 , incubation of `` P-labeled HUVEC with SS RBC plus E-CM resulted in a time-dependent increase in PECAM-1 phosphorylation .
We observed approximately a sixfold ( 638 % + 220 % ) increase in the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 at 1 hour .
At the 2-hour time point ; the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 showed a fivefold increase above the basal level .

SS RBC-INDUCED OXIDANT STRESS IN ENDOTHELIUM with sickle cell anemia , wherein one observes the presence of increased number of activated circulating endothelial cells in blood samples . ``
'' `` In this study , we examined the mechanism ( s ) by which the adherence of SS RBC to cultured endothelial cells , proximal sites of stasis of SS RBC in the vasculature , potentially augments the adherence of SS reticulocytes , and promotes the adherence and migration of monocytes across the endothelial cell monolayer .
SS RBC , because of the presence of unstable SS hemoglobin and spontaneous auto-oxidation of iron in sickle heme `` generate excessive ( two- to threefold ) amounts of ROS ( Oy , OH , and H ; O ; ) ( ROS ) compared with control normal RBC . ``
We show here that HUVEC incubated with SS RBC generates threefold increased amount of lipid peroxides ( mea-sured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances , TBARS ) .
However , HUVEC incubated with SS RBC plus vWf ( E-CM ) resulted in an additional twofold TBARS formation .
The formation of TBARS by HUVEC is inhibited by the addition of free radical scavenging enzymes , superoxide dismutase , and catalase .
Moreover , blocking the adherence of SS RBC to endothelial cells , reduced TBARS formation .
We also measured the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB in HUVEC , another indicator of cellular oxidant stress . '
'' Our results show that the adherence/contact of SS RBC to endothelial cells , mediated by multimers of vW1 , led to activation of NF-kB .
This activation of NF-kB in HUVEC required the adhesion/contact of SS RBC and was also inhibited by antioxidants .
These results suggest that adherence/contact of SS RBC mediated by multimers of vW1 , localizes the oxidant stimulus generated by SS RBC to the membrane of endothelial cells and generates intracellular ROS in HUVEC to activate NF-kB .
The intracellular generation of ROS ( oxidative stress ) could occur as a result of activation of NADH-oxidase associated with the plasma membrane of endothelial cells . ``
We show that incubation of HUVEC with SS RBC , in the presence of multimers of vWf , results in a time-dependent increase in the surface expression of a subset of CAMs , ICAM-1 , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 without affecting the surface expression of constitutively expressed ICAM-2 .
The augmented expression of VCAM-1 , examined in this study , was observed on the adhesion of SS RBC to HUVEC but was not observed when vWf ( E-CM ) alone was added to HUVEC .
Our studies show that the cellular oxidant stress generated in HUVEC induced by SS RBC adherence involves a glutathione redox step because agents that restore intracellular GSH levels prevent VCAM-1 expression , whereas an opposite effect occurs when intracellular GSH levels are reduced by preincubation of HUVEC with BSO , an inhibitor of GSH synthesis .
Conse-quently , agents that restore intracellular levels of GSH levels may prevent VCAM-1 expression and thus could have beneficial effects on microvascular occlusion .
Our results are consonant with previous studies wherein the transcription of VCAM-1 in human vascular endothelial cells , induced by cytokine IL-1 f , has also been shown to be regulated through an antioxidant-sensitive mechanism .
'* Moreover , our studies show that the addition of free radical scavenger enzymes ( superoxide dismutase and catalase ) , abrogated SS RBC plus E-CM-induced VCAM-1 expression .
Our studies indicate that ROS formed by SS RBC or SS RBC ligand-receptor interaction ( juxtacrine 3933 intercellular signaling ) `` and/or both result in the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( oxidant stress ) intracellularly in endothelial cells , which activate signaling pathways leading to the activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-kB .
Our studies show here , for the first time , that interaction of SS RBC with HUVEC , in the presence of vWf causes an increase in the migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells .
We used vitamin D , -differentiated human HL-60 cells ( monocyte-like HL-60 cells ) , because this cell line was previously used as a reliable model of in vivo monocyte function and transendothelial migration studies . ``
'' Similarly , the transendothelial migration of human PBM was augmented by the cellular oxidant stress generated by the adhesion of SS RBC to endothelial cells .
The increase in the transendothelial migration of both monocyte-like HL-60 cells and PBM is inhibited by an antibody to PECAM-1 , as has been previously observed for the transendothelial migration of monocytes induced by lipoxygenase metabolites . ``
We show here that the adherence of SS RBC to HUVEC , mediated by vWf , leads to PECAM-1 phosphorylation .
Both the SS RBC plus E-CM-induced phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and the transendothelial migration of monocyte-like HL-60 cells are inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitor , indicating the direct or causal involvement of PECAM-1 phosphorylation in mediating the flux of monocytes across the endothelial cell monolayer , as has been previously observed for the lipoxygenase metabolite-induced transendothelial migration of monocytes . ``
'' The importance of PECAM-1 phosphorylation to transendothelial migration is further supported by findings that agents such as the phosphatase inhibitor Calyculin A , which increases the phosphorylation of PECAM-1 , also augment monocyte migration over and above the level of SS RBC alone .
As expected , antioxidants and modulators of intracellular GSH levels , which affect SS RBC-induced cellular signals , also affect phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and , concomitant with it , the transendothelial migration of monocytes .
In conclusion , our studies show that interaction of oxygenated SS RBC with HUVEC in the presence of multimers of vWf , generates reactive oxygen species ( oxidant stress ) in endothelial cells .
The adherence/contact of SS RBC to endothelial cells helps in localizing the oxidant stimulus to the cell surface to initiate cellular signaling .
As a consequence of the cellular signaling , activation of transcription factor NF-kB occurs in HUVEC leading to the binding of activated NF-kB to the consensus sites in the regulatory regions of DNA for several genes including a subset of CAMs , thereby bringing about the cell-surface expression of a subset of CAMs , ICAM-1 , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 .
The increased expression of CAMs in response to oxidative stress is not unique to the adhesion of SS RBC to endothelium , but can occur in response to endotoxins or hypoxia , conditions eg , bacterial infection and tissue hypox-emia commonly associated with SCD .
The increased surface expression of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells , as a result of the adherence of SS RBC , will promote additional adherence of SS reticulocytes expressing the « , B ; ligand via VCAM-1 .
These CAMs also act as receptors/adhesive agents for PMN and monocytes expressing the appropriate counter-receptors .

3934 of blood and promote vasoocelusion .
Furthermore , our studies show that the cellular oxidant stress , generated by the adhesion of SS RBC to HUVEC brings about increased migration of monocytes across the endothelial cell monolayer .
In SCD , it is possible that the accumulation of monocytes may participate in the stroke syndrome in which arterial narrowing and thrombosis resemble the events observed in cerebrovascular atherosclero-sis .
Thus the abnormal adherence of SS RBC to endothelial cells from large vessels can generate enhanced oxidant stress leading to increased adhesion and diapedesis of monocytes , as well as heightened adherence of SS reticulocytes .
Although the studies presented have been conducted in endothelial cells derived from large vessels , we suspect that a similar phenomenon may also occur in microvascular endothelium in which the adhesion of SS RBC has been shown to be mediated by thrombospondin .
Such studies should provide an insight into the process of obstruction or intermittent flow of blood observed in the microcirculation of patients with SCD .
Further studies should be performed to determine whether density-fractionated less-dense ( enriched in reticulocytes ) , or most-dense fraction of sickle blood , with and without deoxygenation , are involved in the generation of cellular oxidant stress and hence activation of endothelium .
