12 OCA-B Is a Functional Analog of VP16 but Targets a Separate Surface of the Oct-1 POU Domain ROBERT BABB , * `` MICHELE A. CLEARY , '¢ anp WINSHIP HERR !

OCA-B associates with the Oct-1 POU domain , a bipartite DNA-binding structure containing a POU-specific ( POU , ) domain joined by a flexible linker to a POU homeodomain ( POU , , ) .
Here , we show that OCA-B alters the activity of Oct-1 in two ways .
It provides a transcriptional activation domain which , unlike Oct-1 , activates an mRNA-type promoter effectively , and it stabilizes Oct-l1 on the Oct-l-responsive octamer sequence ATGCAAAT .
These properties of OCA-B parallel those displayed by the herpes simplex virus Oct-1 coregulator VP16 .
OCA-B , however , interacts with a different surface of the DNA-bound Oct-1 POU domain , interacting with both the POU and POU , domains and the center of the ATGCAAAT octamer sequence .
The OCA-B and VP16 interactions with the Oct-1 POU domain are sufficiently different to permit OCA-B and VP16 to bind the Oct-1 POU domain simultaneously .
These results emphasize the structural versatility of the Oct-1 POU domain in its interaction with coregulators .
In eukaryotes , the activities of transcriptional activators can be modified by coregulators , thus providing flexibility and diversity in transcriptional regulation .
For example , the broadly expressed human POU domain transcription factor Oct-1 acquires cell-specific promoter activation properties through association with both viral and cellular coregulators .
In herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) -infected cells , HSV virion protein VP16 ( also referred to as Vmw65 and « TIF ) activates HSV immediate-early gene transcription by directing the formation of a multiprotein-DNA complex with Oct-1 and another cellular protein , HCF ( also referred to as C1 , VCAF , and CFF ) on VP16-responsive TAATGARAT elements ( for reviews , see references 18 , 36 , and 54 ) .
In B cells , Oct-1 associates with the cellular transactivator OCA-B ( also referred to as OBF-1 and Bob-1 ) to activate transcription from octamer ( ATGCAAAT ) elements in immunoglobulin ( Ig ) gene promoters ( 17 , 29 , 30 , 48 ) .
Oct-1 binds to a diverse range of cis-regulatory DNA sequences through its DNA-binding POU domain , a bipartite structure consisting of an amino-terminal POU-specific ( POU ) domain joined by a flexible linker to a carboxy-terminal POU homeodomain ( POU , ; ) ( for reviews , see references 18 and 42 ) .
High-affinity Oct-1-binding sites include the octamer sequence found in a number of cellular promoters , such as the broadly expressed histone H2B and small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) promoters .
Consistent with the presence of Oct-1-binding sites in snRNA promoters , Oct-1 contains activation domains which activate transcription from snRNA promoters preferentially ; in contrast , many activation domains activate transcription from mRNA promoters preferentially ( 10 , 53 ) .
Both VP16 ( 24 , 47 ) and OCA-B ( 17 , 30 , 48 ) interact with Oct-1 through its POU domain .
VP16 recognizes residues on the solvent-exposed surface of the DNA-bound Oct-1 POU ; domain ( 25 , 40 , 47 ) and alters the transcriptional activity of Oct-1 in two ways , ( i ) by providing a transcriptional activation * Corresponding author .

7295 domain which activates mRNA promoters preferentially ( 10 ) and ( ii ) by stabilizing Oct-1 on VP16-responsive elements ( 5 ) .
OCA-B also stimulates the activation of mRNA-type promoters by Oct-1 ( 17 , 29 , 30 , 48 ) , but the requirements for OCA-B interaction with Oct-1 and the nature of the effects of this interaction on the activities of Oct-1 have not been extensively characterized .
Here , we analyzed the functional properties of OCA-B .
The results show that OCA-B functions analogously to VP16 .
OCA-B contains an activation domain which preferentially activates mRNA-type promoters , and OCA-B can stabilize Oct-1 binding to a cis-regulatory site .
In contrast to VP16 , however , OCA-B recognizes a separate surface of the Oct-1 POU domain .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Reporter plasmids .
Reporter constructs pc-fos/-197/4xG17M and pU2/-198/ 4xG17M have been described previously ( 10 ) .
For the in vivo corecruitment assay , two tandem copies of wild-type or mutant As-T ( ATGCITAAT ) Ig ( x ) octamer sites ( 38 ) separated by Xho !
recognition sequences , GAGGAGCATG CAAATCATTGGCTC , were inserted into the Sme site of pU2/B ( 5 ) .
Effector plasmids .
Full-length human OCA-B coding sequences were amplified from B-JAB cell RNA by reverse transcriptase PCR with primers , 5° CAT CTAGACTCTGGCAAAAACCCACAGC ( OBFNXBA ) and 3 ' CAGGATCC TAAAAGCCTTCCACAGAG ( OBFCBAM ) , containing Xbel and BamHI sites ( underlined ) , respectively .
These sequences were inserted between the Xbal and BamHI sites of the hemagglutinin epitope tag-cytomegalovirus promoter expression vector pCGN ( 52 ) , creating pCGN-OCA-B .
pCGN-OCA-BAC was prepared via PCR amplification of sequences encoding OCA-B residues 1 to 119. pCGN-Oct-1-POU is a derivative of pCG-Oct-1-POU ( 25 ) that contains the hemagglutinin epitope tag .
pCGN-POU-VP16 was created by the insertion of sequences encoding the VP16 activation domain ( residues 413 to 490 ) , flanked by 5° Xbel and 3 ' Nhe !
sites , into the Xbel site of pCGN-Oct-1-POU 5 ' of the Oct-1 POU domain coding sequences .
pCGN-POUs-g-VP16 was created by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis ( 32 ) .
The GAL4 fusion activators have been previously described ( 10 ) , except for pCG-GALA ( 1-94 ) -OCA-B1z0 256 , which contains the sequences encoding OCA-B residues 120 to 256 .
All effector constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis .

Mutant POU domain proteins were gen-crated by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid pET11c.G.POU-1 ( 25 ) , which encodes the Oct-1 POU domain fused to the glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) gene product .
Double-mutant POU domain proteins ( POUsp ; gq POUzp > za and POUs.gigcyasn ) were made by two suc- 7296 BABB ET AL .

Mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis .
Wild-type and mutant DNA-binding sites .
The H2B octamer site has been described previously ( 5 ) .
The mutant site ICPO perfect octamer ( CATGCAAA TGATATT ) was created by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of ICPO/TAAT-1 ( 6 ) .
The probes used for electropheretic mobility retardation analysis were generated by PCR amplification with *°P-end-labeled primers as previously described ( 6 ) .
The DNA probes used ( see Fig .
4 ) were made by annealing *°P-end-labeled complementary oligonucleotides , 5 ' GGGGAGAGT TCGAGGCTTATGCAAATAAGGTGCTCGAGACCTGCGC 3 ' ( H2BWT1 ) and 5° GCGCAGGTCTCGAGCACCTTATITGCATAAGCCTCGAACTCTC CCC 3 ' ( H2BWT2 ) .
H2B octamer mutant sites G ; -T , C , > T , As-T , Ag-T , ICs , and IC , were generated by annealing complementary mutant H2BWT1- and H2BWT2-related oligonucleotides .
To generate DNase I footprinting probe pUC119-H2B/OCTA+Igk/OCTA , wild-type or mutant A , ; -T Ig ( x ) octamer sites were inserted into the Smel site of pUC119-H2B/OCTA ( 5 ) in such a way that both octamer sites were in the same orientation and separated by 33 bp .
Probes were generated by PCR amplification with a *°P-end-labeled universal sequencing primer and an unlabeled primer , RSP-100 ( 5'-TGTGAGTTAGCTCACT 3 ' ) , which anneals to sequences approximately 100 bp upstream of the reverse sequencing primer .
Protein expression and purification .
Wild-type and POUs.5 ; g GST-Oct-1 POU domain proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) and purified as described previously ( 25 ) .
Wild-type and mutant Oct-1 POU domains and OCA-B used in electrophoretic mobility retardation assays were synthesized in vitro as described previously ( 6 ) .
OCA-B for DNase I footprint analysis was prepared by overexpression after calcium phosphate coprecipitation-mediated transfection ( 51 ) of 10° HeLa cells with 16 ug of pCGN-OCA-B , followed by whole-cell nuclear extract preparation as previously described ( 53 ) .
VP16AC was expressed in and purified from £ .
coli as previously described ( 57 ) , and HCF4sp ( HCF amino acids 1 to 450 ) ( 58 ) was prepared by in vitro translation .
In vivo transcription assays .
Transcriptional activities were assayed in vivo by calcium phosphate coprecipitation-mediated transfection of HeLa cells and RNase protection of isolated RNAs ( 51 ) with « 98 and B134 probes ( 5 ) , the c-fos probe ( 50 ) , and U2 probe A ( 28 ) .
In GALA activation domain fusion assays ( 10 ) , the expression of GAL4 fusion activators was monitored by electropheretic mobility retardation analysis .
All activators were expressed at similar levels as single , apparently full-length species , except for GALA-VP16 ; it was expressed at lower levels , but this lower-level expression did not prevent transcriptional activation .
In the in vivo Oct-1 POU domain-OCA-B recruitment assay , 640 ng of pCGN-Oct-1-POU or a derivative was cotransfected with 480 ng of pCGN-OCA¥-BAC , 4 pg of reporter plasmid , and 160 ng of internal reference plasmid padx ( A+C ) ( 51 ) .
The specific activities of the B-globin and c-fos probes were half those of the « -globin and U2 probes .
Unprotected RNA was digested by RNases A and T ; , and protected fragments were visualized by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 6 % polyacrylamide ) .
The levels of reporter gene expression were quantified on a Fuji BAS1000 phosphorimager .
DNase I protection analysis .
Protein-DNA binding was performed in 50-pl reaction mixtures containing 2 x 10* cpm of DNA probe , 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 50 mM KCI , 2 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM EDTA , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , 2 % glycerol , 2 % Ficoll , 3 mg of fetal bovine serum per ml , 50 ng of fish sperm DNA , 3.2 mg of unsonicated poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia ) , and 2 % polyvinyl alcohol .
Purified recombinant GST-Oct-1 POU domain fusion protein ( 13 ng ) and 5 pl of either mock- or OCA-B-transfected HeLa cell extract were used as indicated .
Prior to DNase I digestion , protein-DNA reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 20 min .
Reactions were carried out as described previously ( 5 ) , except that more DNase I ( 230 ng ; Worthington ) was used per reaction .
Electrophoretic mobility retardation assays .
Protcin-DNA binding reactions ( 10 pl ) were performed as follows .
In vitro-translated Oct-1 POU domain ( 1 pl ) , OCA-B ( 2 wl ) , HCF , s , ( 0.5 wl ) , and E. coli-expressed VP16 ( 40 ng ) were incubated with 2 X 10° cpm DNA probe in 10 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.9 ) -50 mM KCl-2 mM dithiothreitol-1 mM EDTA-0.1 % Nonidet P-40-2 % glycerol-2 % Ficoll-3 mg of fetal bovine serum per ml-10 ng of fish sperm DNA-640 ng of unsonicated poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia ) for 30 min at 30°C .
After incubation , reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 6.5 % polyacrylamide gel ( acrylamide/ bisacrylamide ratio , 19:1 ) in 0.25 % TBE ( 22.5 mM Tris-borate , 0.5 mM EDTA ) , which had been subjected to electrophoresis for 1 h at room temperature .

We subsequently probed the surfaces Mor .

c-fos mRNA ( lanes 1 through 7 ) or U2 snRNA ( lanes 8 through 14 ) reporter plasmids and an « -globin internal reference plasmid were transiently transfected into HeLa cells along with the appropriate activator expression plasmid , and RNA expression was monitored by RNase protection analysis as described in Materials and Methods .

of the DNA and Oct-1 POU domain required for OCA-B association with Oct-1 on an octamer site .
OCA-B contains an mRNA-type promoter-selective activation domain .
Transcriptional activation domains can display promoter selectivity , distinguishing for example between mRNA- and snRNA-type promoters ( 10 , 53 ) .
Figure 1 shows a comparison of the activation domain properties of OCA-B ( residues 120 to 256 ) ( 17 ) with the mRNA-type promoter-selective activation domains from VP16 and the Oct-1-related B-cell POU domain activator Oct-2 and with the snRNA promoter-selective activation domains from Oct-1 and a second snRNA promoter activator , Spl ( 10 ) .
These activation domains were fused to the GALA DNA-binding domain ( amino acids 1 to 94 ) and assayed with c-fos mRNA and UZ snRNA promoters containing GAL4-binding sites by transient expression in HeLa cells .
An « -globin gene was used as a reference for transfection efficiency , and correctly initiated transcripts were measured by RNase protection .
Consistent with previous results ( 10 ) , the VP16- and Oct-2-derived activation domains were better activators of the c-fos promoter ( and of an mRNA-type read-through transcript [ U2 RT ] [ 10 ] evident with the UZ snRNA promoter construct [ Fig .
1 , lanes 8 through 14 ] ) than were the Oct-1- and Sp1-derived activation domains ( compare lanes 3 and 7 with lanes 4 and 6 ) .
The OCA-B activation domain was also an effective activator of the c-fos promoter ; it was as active as the Oct-2-derived activation domain ( Fig .
1 ; compare lanes 5 and 7 ) .
With the U2 snRNA promoter , however , the Oct-1- and Spl-derived activation domains were more active than were the VP16- and Oct-2-derived activation domains ( Fig .
1 ; compare lanes 10 and 14 with lanes 11 and 13 ) and the OCA-B activation domain ( lane 12 ) .
Thus , like the activation domain of VP16 , the OCA-B activation domain displays mRNA promoter selectivity , which provides one explanation as to how , by association with Oct-1 , OCA-B can enhance Oct-1 activation of an mRNA promoter ( 17 , 29 , 30 , 48 ) .

OCA-B recruits the Oct-1 POU domain to the Ig ( x ) octamer site in vitro .
DNase I protection analysis of Oct-1 POU domain binding was performed with a DNA probe containing the histone H2B ( H2B OCTA ) and Ig ( « ) ( Ig « OCTA ) promoter octamer sites .
Recombinant wild-type ( WT ; lanes 4 , 5 , 10 , and 11 ) and POUs ; g mutant ( lanes 6 and 7 ) GST-Oct-1 POU domain proteins were assayed in either the presence ( + ; lanes 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 11 ) or absence ( - ; lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ) of OCA-B on a probe containing either WT ( lanes 2 through 7 ) or mutant ( As-T ; lanes 8 through 11 ) Ig ( « ) octamer sites .

OCA-B enhances binding of the Oct-1 POU domain to an octamer site both in vitro and in vivo .
We assayed the ability of OCA-B to stabilize Oct-1 on an OCA-B-responsive element both in vitro and in vivo .
To assay stabilization in vitro , we examined the effects of OCA-B on Oct-1 POU domain binding to a previously described octamer site from an Igx promoter ( 38 ) by DNase I protection analysis .
As a positive control for Oct-1 binding to the DNA probe used for DNase I protection analysis , we placed nearby to the Ig ( x ) octamer site an octamer site with a higher affinity for Oct-1 , the histone H2B promoter octamer site ( 38 ) .
Figure 2 shows Oct-1 POU domain binding Oct-1-OCA¥-B COREGULATORY FUNCTION - 7297 to these two octamer sites in the presence and absence of full-length OCA-B .
In the absence of the Oct-1 POU domain , OCA-B had no evident effect on the DNase I cleavage pattern of the probe ( Fig .
2 ; compare lanes 2 and 3 ) .
At a concentration of Oct-1 POU domain that affords full protection of the histone H2B octamer site but only partial protection of the Ig ( x ) site ( Fig .
2 , lane 4 ) , the addition of OCA-B enhanced but otherwise did not change Oct-1 POU domain protection of the Ig ( x ) site ( compare lanes 4 and 5 ) .
The enhanced protection was dependent on OCA-B association with Oct-1 because it was not observed when the Oct-1 POU domain ( POUg pz ) ( Fig .
2 , lane 7 ) or the octamer site ( A ; -T ) ( lane 11 ) contained single point mutations that had ( see below ) little or no effect on Oct-1 binding alone but specifically disrupted OCA-B association with Oct-1 .
Thus , as is the case with VP16 on a TAATGARAT element ( 5 ) , OCA-B can stabilize Oct-1 on an octamer site in vitro .
To measure OCA-B recruitment of Oct-1 to an OCA-B-responsive element in vivo , we fused the potent mRNA promoter activation domain of VP16 to the Oct-1 POU domain and assayed the activity of this fusion protein in the presence and absence of OCA-B in a transient-expression assay .
The transcriptional activity of this fusion protein should reflect its relative occupancy of the octamer response element .
For this assay , we created a reporter containing two tandem copies of the Ig ( x ) octamer site upstream of a minimal -globin promoter .
To ensure that any transcriptional readout reflected recruitment of the Oct-1-VP16 fusion protein rather than direct activation by OCA-B , we removed the carboxy-terminal activation domain ( amino acids 120 to 256 ) from OCA-B ; the remainder of OCA-B ( OCA-BAC ) retains the ability to interact with the Oct-1 POU domain ( 16 , 48 ) .
Figure 3 shows the results of such an in vivo Oct-1 recruitment assay .
When OCA-BAC was transiently expressed either alone ( Fig .
3 , lane 2 ) or with the Oct-1 POU domain ( lane 4 ) , there was no evident activation of transcription , as expected .
To our surprise , the Oct-1 POU domain-VP16 fusion protein alone did not activate transcription from the octamer site effectively ( Fig .
3 , lane 5 ) ; in the presence of OCA-BAC , however , high levels of transcription were achieved ( lane 6 ) .
The enhanced activation of the reporter by the Oct-1 POU domain-VP16 fusion protein in the presence of OCA-BAC likely results from its recruitment to the octamer site because ( i ) immunoblot analysis showed that its expression was not elevated in the presence of OCA-BAC ( data not shown ) and ( ii ) OCA-BAC enhancement of transcription was disrupted by the Oct-1 POU domain ( lane 8 ) and octamer site lane 14 ) point mutations introduced above .
Indeed , when the Oct-1 POU domain and octamer site ( A ; -T ) point mutations were combined , OCA-BAC had no evident effect on the activation of transcription by the Oct-1 POU domain-VP16 fusion protein ( Fig .
3 ; compare lanes 5 and 16 ) .
These results can be explained by OCA-B recruitment of the Oct-1 POU domain fusion protein to the octamer site in vivo or by OCA-B enhancement of the activity of the VP16 transcriptional activation domain tethered to DNA by the Oct-1 POU domain ; although we can not exclude the latter , we favor the former hypothesis because it is consistent with the in vitro studies described above .
Thus , these results suggest that as is the case with VP16 on a TAATGARAT element ( 5 ) , OCA-B association with the Oct-1 POU domain results in Oct-1 recruitment to DNA in vivo .
To our surprise , in the case of OCA-B , these effects were seen even with a consensus octamer site .

OCA-B recruits the Oct-1 POU domain to the Ig ( x ) octamer site in vivo .
Transcriptional activation was measured by RNase protection analysis of RNA isolated from transiently transfected HeLa cells as described in Materials and Methods .
Wild-type ( WT ; lanes 1 through 8 ) and mutant ( A5-T ; lanes 9 through 16 ) Ig ( x ) octamer-containing reporter plasmids were cotransfected with ( + ; even-numbered lanes ) or without ( - ; odd-numbered lanes ) an OCA-BAC ( amino acids 1 through 119 ) expression vector and the Oct-1 POU domain expression vector indicated above each pair of lanes .
The positions of correctly initiated « -globin ( « ) and B-globin ( B ) transcripts are indicated .
site in vitro and in vivo reveal that OCA-B is a functional analog of VP16 ; it alters both the transcriptional activation and DNA-binding properties of Oct-1 in a manner analogous to that of VP16 .
OCA-B makes multiple DNA contacts in the major groove at the center of the octamer sequence .
On a VP16-responsive TAATGARAT site containing an overlapping octamer sequence [ ( OCTA* ) TAATGARAT ] , residues 3 ' of the octamer sequence are important for VP16 association with Oct-1 ( 15 , 20 , 24 , 31 , 35 ) .
OCA-B association with Oct-1 is also DNA sequence dependent ; the fifth position of the octamer sequence ATGCAAAT is important for OCA-B binding to Oct-1 ( 4 , 16 ) .
To characterize the DNA sequence requirements for OCA-B association with Oct-1 in greater detail , we investigated the effects of individual substitutions of the central four residues of a perfect octamer site ( positions 3 through 6 [ ATGCAAAT ] ) with thymine on OCA-B-Oct-1 complex formation in an electrophoretic mobility retardation assay ( Fig .
4 ) .
Because the structure of the Oct-1 POU domain-octamer site complex was determined on the histone H2B octamer site ( 23 ) , we used this site ( Fig .
4A ) to study OCA-B association with DNA-bound Oct-1 .
All of the thymine substitutions in the core of the octamer sequence affected Oct-1 binding but to various degrees ( see the legend to Fig .
4 ) .
To determine the effects of thymine substitutions on OCA-B binding , we titrated the concentration of Oct-1 to generate similar levels of octamer site binding to all of the thymine-substituted sites ( Fig .
4B , lanes 1 through 5 ; only the Oct-l-octamer site complex is shown ) .
The addition of in vitro-translated OCA-B to these binding reactions retarded the mobility of Oct-1 on the wild-type site ( Fig .
4B ; compare lanes 1 and 7 with lanes 8 and 14 ) .
OCA-B , however , failed to associate with Oct-1 on the two sites carrying thymine substitutions at positions 5 and 6 ( Fig .
4B ; lanes 11 and 12 , respectively ) and had intermediate effects on the mobilities of Oct-1 complexes on the two sites with substitutions at positions 3 and 4 ( lanes 9 and 10 , respectively ) .
The reason for the intermedi- ate effects of the substitutions at positions 3 and 4 is not known but may reflect partial interference with OCA-B association with Oct-1 .
Together , the results with these thymine substitutions indicate that OCA-B interacts directly or indirectly with the four central residues of the octamer sequence .
In the Oct-1 POU domain-octamer site cocrystal structure , the major groove of the DNA is accessible at positions 5 and 6 of the octamer sequence ( ATGCAAAT ) .
To test whether the strong effects of the thymine substitutions at positions 5 and 6 on OCA-B association with the Oct-1-DNA complex reflected interaction with the major groove of DNA , we individually replaced these two AT base pairs with IC base pairs , substitutions that selectively alter the major groove ( 45 ) .
Although they permitted binding by Oct-1 ( Fig .
4C , lanes 2 and 3 ) , both of these IC substitutions interfered with OCA-B association with Oct-1 severely ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , indicating that OCA-B indeed recognizes the major groove of DNA at these two positions .
The effect of the substitution at position 5 is consistent with a parallel disruption of OCA-B binding by a 5-methyl IC base pair at this position ( 4 ) .
In contrast to the other substitutions we analyzed , the IC substitution at position 6 did not affect Oct-1 binding to the octamer site ( see the legend to Fig .
4 ) , suggesting that at least at this position OCA-B interacts directly with the major groove of DNA .
In summary , as is the case with VP16 , OCA-B association with Oct-1 depends on multiple DNA residues in the regulatory site ; however , unlike VP16 , which depends on residues 3 ' of the octamer sequence , OCA-B depends on residues within the octamer sequence .
OCA-B fails to interact with the Pit-1 POU domain due to amino acid differences in both the POU and POU , domains .
In contrast to VP16 ( 24 , 47 ) , OCA-B does not discriminate between the POU domains of Oct-1 and the closely related B-cell POU domain protein Oct-2 ( 4 , 17 , 30 , 48 ) .
The more distantly related N-Oct-3 ( Brn-2 ) , Oct-3/4 , and Oct-6 ( SCIP ) POU domains , however , fail to interact with OCA-B ( 17 , 30 , 48 ) .
Here , we studied OCA-B interaction with the pituitary Vor .

OCA-B and SNAP , interactions with the Oct-1 POU , domain overlap .
To probe the determinants of the Oct-1 POU domain interaction in more detail , we analyzed OCA-B association with an extended series of Oct-1 POU domains carrying one to six amino acid substitutions from the Pit-1 POU , domain sequence across the entire Oct-1 POU , domain ( Fig .
6 ) .
This analysis revealed that Pit-1 sequences in two regions of the POU domain , in the amino-terminal region of « -helix 1 ( EIR-1 ) and within « -helix 4 ( Pa4 ) , disrupted OCA-B association ( Fig .
6 ) .
The EIR-1 substitution also affects Oct-1 POU domain association with the basal snRNA promoter complex SNAP / PTF ( 32 ) .
In that case , of three substitutions in EIR-1 ( DSE , L6I , and E7R ) , only one ( E7R ) affects Oct-1 POU domain interaction with SNAP , ( 32 ) .
Similar to the effect on SNAP , interaction , only the E7R swap in the amino-terminal region of « -helix 1 affected OCA-B association ( Fig .

In contrast to SNAP , ( 32 ) and consistent with the effects of the Pa4 substitution , the complementary R7E substitution in the Pit-1 POU , domain was not sufficient to activate the Pit-1 POU domain for association with OCA-B ( Fig .

Thus , OCA-B , a B-cell Oct-1 coregulator , and SNAP , , , a basal snRNA promoter complex , recognize the same precise difference within the amino-termi- 7300 BABB ET AL .

OCA-B interaction surface on the Oct-1 POU domain .
To map the precise surface of the Oct-1 POU domain that is targeted by OCA-B , we assayed the activities of a systematic series of alanine substitutions in the Oct-1 POU domain .
We used the Oct-1 POU domain-octamer site cocrystal structure ( 23 ) to guide the selection of residues for alanine substitutions .
An examination of the Oct-1 POU domain-octamer site cocrystal structure revealed that the glutamic acid at position 7 of the Oct-1 POU , domain , which is critical for OCA-B association , is located on the same face of the Oct-1 POU domain-DNA complex as are the DNA major groove positions that are important for interaction with OCA-B ( positions 5 and 6 [ Fig .
4 ] ) .
Therefore , we individually replaced all of the solvent-exposed residues on this surface of the POU domain with alanine .
To test the importance of Oct-1 POU domain-octamer site interactions for OCA-B association , we also included two separate alanine substitutions for conserved residues in the POU and POU , domains that contact DNA ( POU domain residue R49 and POU , domain residue N51 ) .
Figure 7 summarizes the activities of the alanine substitution mutants and shows the results of electrophoretic mobility retardation assays for a representative set of mutations .
Of the 23 alanine substitutions in the Oct-1 POU , domain assayed , only one ( R49A ) had a great effect on DNA binding ( Fig .
7A , lane 3 ) ( 6 , 55 ) ; consistent with the importance of the POU domain for OCA-B interaction , this mutant also failed to associate with OCA-B ( lane 3 ) .
Nine of the other 22 POUs alanine substitutions also affected Oct-1 POU domain association with OCA-B ( Fig .
7B ) .
Consistent with previous results ( 16 ) , mutants L53A , L55SA , and N59A , but not mutant NS4A , failed to associate effectively with OCA-B .
The representative set of POU , domain substitutions in Fig .
7A includes substitutions in the amino-terminal region of « -helix 1 and in a-helix 4 .
The results for « -helix 1 substitutions show that as was the case in Oct-1 and Pit-1 swaps , E7 was critical for OCA-B association ; in contrast to the results for the L6I substitution in Oct-1 and Pit-1 swaps ( Fig .
6 ) , the LGA substitution affected OCA-B association ( Fig .
7A , lane 5 ) .
These results suggest that positions 6 and 7 are critical for OCA-B association but that a conservative substitution ( iso-leucine for leucine ) can be tolerated at position 6 .
The results for substitutions in « -helix 4 show that a mutation of the proline at position 65 ( P65 ) which causes a bend in this « -helix ( 23 ) did not disrupt OCA-B association with the Oct-1 POU domain ( Fig .
7A , lane 9 ) , suggesting that some structural changes in the POU , domain can be tolerated without necessarily affecting the interaction with OCA-B .
Alanine substitution for the methionine at position 60 ( M6OA ) , however , affected OCA-B interaction ( Fig .
7A , lane 8 ) ; this residue lies between the major groove contacts at positions 5 and 6 of the octamer site on one side and POU , domain residues L6 and E7 on the other side ( see below ) .
Together , the substitutions that affect OCA-B interaction form a patch on the surface of the Oct-1 POU , domain ( see below ) , suggesting that this region of the Oct-1 POU , domain contacts OCA-B .
We assayed 14 alanine substitutions in the Oct-1 POU domain for the ability to interact with OCA-B .
Unexpectedly , the substitution for N51 , which is conserved in nearly all ho-meodomains and makes specific base contacts in homeodo-main-binding sites ( 13 ) , had only a twofold effect on binding to the histone H2B octamer site ( Fig .
7A ; compare lanes 12 and 13 ) .
Although it had relatively little effect on DNA binding per se at this site , it had a large effect on OCA-B association ( Fig .
7A , lane 13 ) .
It is unlikely that OCA-B contacts this asparagine directly because it is not exposed when the POU domain is bound to the octamer site ( 23 ) ; perhaps the precise arrangement of the POU , domain on the DNA is critical for association with OCA-B .
Only 3 of the other 13 alanine substitutions assayed affected association with OCA-B ( Fig .
7B ) .
Consistent with previous results ( 16 ) , substitutions R13A and E17A did not affect the interaction with OCA-B .
Two mutations , E2ZA and E30A , which prevent VP16 interaction with the Oct-1 POU domain ( 25 , 39 , 40 ) did not affect the ability of the POU domain to interact with OCA-B ( Fig .
7A , lanes 15 and 16 ) .
All three substitutions that did affect OCA-B association are within the carboxy-terminal region of « -helix 3 , the DNA recognition helix ( Fig .
7A , lanes 18 and 19 , and B ) .
Figure 8 summarizes these results .
It shows three representations of the Oct-1 POU domain-octamer site cocrystal structure ( the POU domain is shown in white , and DNA is shown in Vor .

In this projection , the major groove octamer site and Oct-1 POU domain substitutions that affect OCA-B association form a continuous surface that links the POU , and POU ; domains via DNA , suggesting that OCA-B contacts the two POU subdomains and the octamer sequence simultaneously .
Rotating the complex shown in Fig .

OCA-B and VP16 can associate with the Oct-1 POU domain simultaneously .
An analysis of the Oct-1 POU domain-OCA-B interaction surface suggested that OCA-B and VP16 target separate surfaces of the POU domain .
To test this hy-pothesis , we determined whether OCA-B and VP16 can interact with the Oct-1 POU domain simultaneously .
For this purpose , by a single base pair substitution , we changed an ( OCTA VP16-responsive element from the HSV ICPO promoter to contain a consensus overlapping octamer sequence , thus creating the ICPO perfect octamer site ( ATGCAAATGATAT ) .
We tested the ability of OCA-B and VP16 to interact with the Oct-1 POU domain on this site in an electrophoretic mobility retardation assay ( Fig .

17 , 1997 OCA-B and VP16 with the Oct-1 POU domain .
By combining the OCA POU , ; ; , , mutation and the VP16-specific POU ; ; ; ; , > , mutation , we created a variant Oct-1 POU domain ( Oct-1 POUsp ; g + POUpp ; > 41 ) that recognized DNA effectively ( Fig .
9 , lane 17 ) but failed to interact with either OCA-B or VP16 ( lanes 18 through 20 ) .
The ability of OCA-B and VP16 to associate with the Oct-1 POU domain simultaneously on a single DNA site indicates that although OCA-B and VP16 affect the function of Oct-1 similarly , they interact with separate protein and DNA surfaces of the DNA-bound Oct-1 POU domain .
DISCUSSION We analyzed the function of the B-cell-specific Oct-1 coregulator OCA-B .
The results show that OCA-B shares functions with the viral Oct-1 coregulator VP16 .
Both change the transcriptional activation potential of Oct-1 and recruit Oct-1 to cis-regulatory sites .
They achieve these functions , however , through completely different interactions with the Oct-1 POU domain and DNA .
OCA -B interacts with a continuous surface of the DNA-bound Oct-1 POU domain , encompassing the POU , domain , the central region of the octamer sequence , and the POU ; domain , whereas VP16 interacts with a different surface of the POU ; domain and with sequences 3 ' of the octamer sequence .
These two surfaces are sufficiently different that these two Oct-1 coregulators can associate with Oct-1 simultaneously .
The POU domain offers flexibility in both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions .
POU domain proteins display considerable flexibility in their interactions with DNA ( 18 ) .
Mutagenesis studies of Brn-2 and Oct-1 ( 6 , 27 , 56 ) and DNA cross-linking studies ( 7 ) have revealed that individual POU domains can adopt different conformations on different cis-regulatory sites .
Indeed , even on a single cis-regulatory site , the Oct-1 POU domain can adopt more than one conformation .
When it is bound to a VP16-responsive TAATGARAT site containing an overlapping octamer sequence , the Oct-1 POU , domain can bind both 5 ' and 3 ' of the POU , ; domain ; surprisingly , both of these conformations are compatible with VP16 association ( 7 ) .
The POU domain also displays great flexibility in its interactions with other proteins .
Previous analyses of Oct-1 POU domain mutations that disrupt interactions with Oct-1 coregulators have shown that VP16 interacts with the POU ; domain ( 41 , 47 ) and that SNAP , interacts with the POU domain ( 32 ) .
Although it is not known whether SNAP , also interacts with the Oct-1 POU ; domain , our study has shown that OCA-B interacts with both the POU and POU ; domains .
The simultaneous interaction of OCA-B with the Oct-1 POU , and POU ; domains and with the DNA between the two POU DNA-binding structures suggests that the Oct-1 POU domain and OCA-B form a linked structure surrounding the octamer site ( Fig .
8C ) .
Such a ring-like structure may form a stable complex for high-level and long-term activation of Ig gene transcription in differentiated B cells .
The bipartite pattern of OCA-B interaction with the Oct-1 POU domain suggests that in contrast to VP16 , which can associate with Oct-1 when the Oct-1 POU , domain is in different positions ( 7 ) , the precise positioning of the two POU domain DNA-binding structures is critical for OCA-B associ-ation .
Consistent with such differences in how VP16 and OCA-B interact with the Oct-1 POU domain , VP16 can associate with Oct-1 when the POU , domain carries the R49¥A POU , domain DNA recognition helix mutation , which disrupts POU , domain binding to DNA ( 6 ) , whereas this mutation Oct-1-OCA¥-B COREGULATORY FUNCTION - 7303 prevented OCA-B association with the Oct-1 POU domain on the octamer site ( Fig .
7 ) .
Surprisingly , although the NS1A substitution in the POU ; domain had little effect on POU domain binding to the histone H2B octamer , it had a major effect on OCA-B association ( Fig .
7 ) , suggesting that the precise configuration of the POU , domain on DNA is also critical for Oct-1 POU domain association with OCA-B .
Whichever Oct-1 POU domain conformation OCA-B recognizes , the ability of the Oct-1 POU domain to associate simultaneously with OCA-B and VP16 ( Fig .
9 ) demonstrates that these two Oct-1 coregulators can recognize the same conformation of the Oct-1 POU domain .
In contrast to the independent interactions of OCA-B and VP16 with the Oct-1 POU domain , the associations of OCA-B and SNAP , with the Oct-1 POU domain are sensitive to the same single amino acid substitution , the E7R Oct-1-Pit-1 exchange in the POU , domain .
Consistent with overlapping OCA-B and SNAP , interactions with the Oct-1 POU domain , in a transient-expression assay , OCA-B is able to interfere with octamer-dependent activation of UZ snRNA gene transcription ( 2 ) .
How do these competing interactions not interfere with one another on an snRNA promoter in a B cell ?
Probably , under natural conditions , promoter-specific interactions ( e.g .
, those of promoter-selective activation domains ) stabilize the appropriate Oct-1 POU domain interaction and prevent com-petition .
Together , the versatility and flexibility displayed by the Oct-1 POU domain in both DNA sequence recognition and coregulator association reveal a DNA-binding domain which can adapt itself to many promoter contexts .
This versatility and flexibility may result from the unusual structural characteristics of the POU domain , in which two independent DNA-binding structures , the POU , and POU , , domains , are joined by a flexible linker .
This structural arrangement provides not only flexibility in how the POU domain binds DNA but also diverse surfaces for interaction with coregulators .
Two mechanisms by which an octamer motif can achieve B-cell-specific gene transcription .
In the context of a typical mRNA-type promoter , the octamer motif displays B-cell-specific activation of transcription ( 11 , 14 , 26 , 59 ) .
One explanation for this specificity is the expression of the Oct-l-related POU domain protein Oct-2 ( 8 , 33 , 43 , 49 ) , which has the same octamer motif-binding specificity ( 46 ) but , in contrast to Oct-1 , contains activation domains which more effectively activate mRNA-type promoters ( 52 , 53 ) .
B-cell-specific OCA-B , with its mRNA-type promoter-selective activation domain ( Fig .
1 ) , provides a second mechanism by which the octamer motif can display B-cell-specific transcription .
Its association with Oct-1 , a generally ineffective activator of mRNA-type promoters ( 52 ) , allows activation of mRNA-type promoters ( 4 , 16 , 17 , 29 , 30 , 48 ) , very similar to what VP16 does on HSV promoters ( 36 , 54 ) .
These two mechanisms by which B-cell-specific octamer motif function is achieved apparently evolved separately .
Oct-1 and Oct-2 arose through gene duplication ( 19 ) , whereas OCA-B probably arose by a different mechanism .
Why have two mechanisms for B-cell-specific octamer motif-dependent transcription arisen ?
Perhaps they provide flexibility in the regulation of B-cell-specific transcription .
For example , although OCA-B association with Oct-1 provides for activation of an mRNA-type promoter , OCA-B association with Oct-2 may provide even higher levels of mRNA-type promoter transcription or transcriptional activation from more distal regulatory elements , such as enhancers ( 37 ) , because of the combination of mRNA-type promoter-selective activation domains provided by both OCA-B and Oct-2 .
Furthermore , OCA-B stabilizes the Oct-1 POU domain ( and probably the 7304 BABB ET AL .
Oct-2 POU domain ) on low-affinity octamer sites ( Fig .
2 and 3 ) , allowing for activation of transcription from promoters that would be silent in the absence of OCA-B despite the presence of Oct-2 .
Thus , in the presence of OCA-B , promoters with low-affinity octamer sites can respond to either Oct-1 and Oct-2 ; however , in the absence of OCA-B , only mRNA-type promoters with high-affinity octamer sites should be active , because of the mRNA-type transcriptional activation domain activity of Oct-2 .
Consistent with the functional redundancy of an OCA-B-Oct-1 complex and Oct-2 alone , gene disruption of OCA-B ( 22 , 44 ) or Oct-2 ( 9 ) does not impair Ig gene transcription in early B cells .
However , mice deficient for either OCA-B or Oct-2 do display different phenotypes , and some of these differences may result from the different activities of OCA-B and Oct-2 in transcriptional activation .
These results reveal that through the generation of families of related transcription factors , such as Oct-1 and Oct-2 , or by using coregulators , such as OCA-B , flexibility and complexity in cell-specific transcription can be achieved .
