Does Activation of the TAL ] Gene Occur in a Majority of Patients With T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ?
A Pediatric Oncology Group Study By Robert 0 .
Bash , Shirley Hail , Charles F. Timmons , William M. Crist , Michael Amylon , R. Graham Smith , and Richard Baer Almost 25 % of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) have tumor-specific rearrangements of the TAL1 gene .
Although TAL ?
expression has not been observed in normal lymphocytes , TALT gene products are readily detected in leukemic cells that harbor a rearranged TAL 1 allele .
Hence , it has been proposed that ectopic expression of TAL1 promotes the development of T-ALL .
In this report , we show that TAL1 is expressed in the leukemic cells of most patients with T-ALL , including many that do not display an apparent TALT gene alteration .
A polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the transcribed sequences of TAL1T was used to determine the allele specificity of TALT tran ERTAIN HEMATOPOIETIC malignancies are characterized by tumor-specific chromosome defects that can be observed in a vast majority of the affected patients .
The Philadelphia chromosome is a seminal example ; this cytogenetic defect arises as a result of the ( 9 ; 22 ) ( q34 ; q11 ) translocation in nearly 85 % of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia . '
'' Similarly , the ( 8 ; 14 ) ( q24 ; q32 ) translocation is found in more than 85 % of Burkitt 's lymphoma patients , and the ( 14 ; 18 ) ( q32 ; q21 ) translocation occurs in over 80 % of patients afflicted with follicular B-cell lymphoma . ``
Significantly , each of these chromosome abnormalities causes the activation of a particular proto-oncogene .
For example , the ( 8 ; 14 ) ( q24 ; q32 ) translocation results in juxtaposition of the MYC gene from chromosome 8 with sequences from the Ig locus on chromosome 14 .
The translocated allele of MYC is thereby activated in a manner that presumably promotes the formation of Burkitt 's lymphoma .
Because most patients with this disease harbor the ( 8 ; 14 ) ( q24 ; q32 ) translocation , From the Department of Pediatrics , Department of Microbiology , Department of Pathology , Department of Internal Medicine , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX ; St Jude Children 's Research Hospital , and The University of Tennessee , Memphis College of Medicine , Memphis , TN ; Department of Pediatrics , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA ; and the Pediatric Oncology Group , Chicago , IL .

Monoallelic expression of TAL1 was observed in the leukemic cells of all patients ( 8 of 8 ) bearing a TAL T gene rearrangement .
In the leukemic cells of patients without detectable TAL1T rearrangements , TAL !
transcription occurred in either a monoallelic ( 3 of 7 patients ) or a biallelic ( 4 of 7 patients ) fashion .
Thus , TALT activation in these patients may result from subtle alterations in cis-acting regulatory sequences { affecting expression of a single TAL1 allele } or changes in trans-acting factors that control TAL1 transcription ( affecting expression of both TALT al-leles } .

MYC activation is likely to be a critical , if not essential , step in the development of Burkitt 's lymphoma .
A variety of distinct chromosome translocations are observed in the malignant cells of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) . ``
At least nine different proto-oncogenes are activated as a result of these translocations , in most cases by juxtaposition with sequences from the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) loci on chromosome 7 or 14 . ``
However , each of these translocations is found in only a small proportion of T-ALL patients .
For example , the most prevalent , the ( 11 ; 14 ) ( p13 ; q11 ) translocation , occurs in less than 10 % of patients with T-ALL .
Consequently , molecular studies of chromosome translocations have failed to identify a common genetic defect critical for the development of T-ALL .
The ( 1 ; 14 ) ( p34 ; q11 ) translocation causes juxtaposition of the TALLI gene with sequences from the TCR « /d chain locus .
* `` Although this translocation is only observed in approximately 3 % of T-ALL patients , `` an additional 25 % of patients harbor a tumor-specific rearrangement of TALZ that is not detected cytogenetically .
'* `` * This rearrangement arises from a local DNA deletion ( the tal `` recombination ) that removes 90 to 100 kbp of upstream sequence from the TAL ] locus .
Thus , TALI rearrangement , whether mediated by chromosome translocation or by tall `` recombination , is the most common genetic defect known to be associated with The presentation features and clinical outcomes of T-ALL patients who have TALI gene rearrangements are almost indistinguishable from those who do not . ``
'' Therefore , it is conceivable that patients without TAL ] rearrangements harbor other genetic alterations that are functionally equivalent .
Notably , the TAL2 and LYL1 genes encode presumptive transcription factors that are highly related to the protein product of TALH . ``
Because TAL2 and LYL1 are also activated by tumor-specific chromosome translocations associated with T-ALL , these genes may promote leukemogenesis in a manner analogous to TAL ] .
* Nevertheless , chromosome translocations involving TAL2 and LYLI are uncommon , affecting fewer than 2 % of patients with T-ALL .
Thus , the majority of T-ALL patients , perhaps as many as 70 % , do not show any of the known tumor-specific alterations of the TALI , TAL2 , or LYLI genes .

ACTIVATION OF THE TAL !
GENE The rearranged alleles of TAL1 are readily transcribed in T-ALL cells , despite the fact that TALI expression has not been observed during normal T-cell development .
Therefore , tumor-specific rearrangement of TAL !
may promote leukemogenesis by inducing ectopic TAL1 expression in cells of the T lineage .
We now report that TAL ] transcripts are present in the malignant cells of most patients with T-ALL , including many that do not have obvious TALL gene alterations .
These findings suggest that malignant activation of TALl can occur in the absence of gross structural DNA rearrangement and that TALJ activation represents a major pathway in the development of T-ALL .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient population .
- Samples of bone marrow ( BM ) , peripheral blood ( PB ) or pleural fluid ( PF ) were obtained before treatment from 219 children with T-ALL .
Sixty-five of these specimens were sent directly to Southwestern Medical Center ( Dallas , TX ) from the Pediatric Oncology Group ( POG ) institution treating the child .
The remainder ( 155 ) were obtained from the POG Cell Bank at St Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( Memphis , TN ) .
All samples were confirmed to be T-ALL as defined by blast cell surface immunophe-notype . ``
All surface marker analyses were performed ( or re-viewed ) by Dr M. Link ( Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) for POG-wide standardization .
BM samples were also obtained before treatment from children diagnosed with early B-lineage ALL at the Children 's Medical Center of Dallas .
All leukemic samples were enriched for lymphoblasts by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation `` ** and frozen as described for Cell Bank specimens `` or directly processed for DNA and RNA .
Leukemic samples from 37 of the 219 T-ALL patients were analyzed for the expression of TAL ] gene products ( Table 1 ) .
Patients no .
1 through 18 were selected from the 65 specimens sent directly to Southwestern Medical Center ; these samples were chosen based solely on the availability of an adequate supply of RNA for ribonuclease protection analysis .
Patients no .
19 through 37 were selected from the 155 POG Cell Bank specimens on the basis of two criteria , ( 1 ) the availability of RNA and ( 2 ) heterozygosity at the ( TG ) , marker of TALI .
Sufficient material from 32 of the 37 samples was also available to perform a manual differential count of the nucleated cells after Wright-Giemsa staining ( Table 1 ) .
Normal control samples were obtained from the excess PB of 84 nonleukemic individuals after diagnostic testing in the laboratories of Children 's Medical Center of Dallas .
DNA extraction and Southern analysis .
- High molecular weight DNA was extracted as previously described . ``
Southern analysis was performed using the AA-0.6 and B2EE-2.0 probes to detect tumor-specific TAL ] gene alterations ( Fig 1 ) .
'* `` ' RNA extraction and ribonuclease protection assays .
RNA was extracted from lymphoblasts by a guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform single-step extraction protocol ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
The RNA was washed with 70 % ethanol and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water .
In vitro translation of the tal1CB/pGEM4 plasmid with SP6 RNA polymerase ( Promega , Mad-ison , WI ) yielded a P-labeled RNA probe of 234 nucleotides ; this probe includes 141 antisense residues that span the exon S5-exon 6 junction of The quality of each leukemic RNA sample was confirmed using a *°P-labeled RNA probe containing 103 antisense nucleotides of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydroge-nase ( GADP ) gene ; the probe was obtained by in vitro translation of the pGADP4/pGEMT7 plasmid ( provided by Dr F.G. Kem , Georgetown University Medical Center , Washington , DC ) .
The ra-diolabeled RPA probes ( TAL1 and GADP ) were annealed simultane- 667 ously to 10 ug of total cellular RNA from each leukemic sample .
After treatment with RNase ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) , the digestion products were separated by electrophoresis on an 8 mol/L urea , 6 % polyacrylamide gel , and the protected bands were visualized by autoradiography .
Identification of the ( TG ) , repeat polymorphism .
- The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) was performed on each leukemic DNA sample using oligonucleotide primers PM2 ( 5-GATTGTCCTCAT-TTCTCCAGATTATC ) and PM3 ( 5-GCAATGATGGCACCA-CTGTACTCCAGC ) .
PM2 and PM3 should allow amplification of an approximately 110-bp fragment spanning the ( TG ) ; ; .
; , dinucleotide repeat of TALI .
The PM3 primer was 5'-end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) and ( y-*P ) ATP .
The PCR reaction consisted of 1 ug DNA , 1 pmol/L PM2 , 1 mol/L PM3 , and 2 U Taq DNA polymerase ( Promega ) in PCR buffer ( 50 mmol/L KC1 , 10 mmol/L Tris-HCI [ pH 9.01 , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 2 mmol/L MgCl1 ; , and 0.2 mmol/L of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate [ dNTP ] ) .
The PCR reaction was performed in a volume of 50 uL using an initial melting step of 94°C for 2 minutes , followed by a `` touchdown `` ' protocol consisting of 94°C for 1 minute , 70°C minus 1°C/cycle for 1 minute , and 72°C for 1 minute for a total of 10 cycles , followed by 25 additional cycles of 94°C for 1 minute , 59°C for 1 minute , and 72°C for 1 minute .
Five microliters of the amplified product were then incubated with 5 uL of Stop Solution ( US Biochemical , Cleveland , OH ) , fractionated by electrophoresis on an 8 mol/L urea , 40 % formamide , 7 % polyacrylamide gel , and visualized by autoradiography .
To prepare size markers for analysis of amplified fragments from leukemic specimens , the PCR products from patients no .
13 , 26 , and 30 were ligated into the pGEM4 vector ( Promega ) ; individual clones with 12 copies ( plasmid A ) , 13 copies ( plasmid B ) , and 14 copies ( plasmid C ) of the ( TG ) dinucleotide repeat were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis .
Ten nano-grams of each plasmid were amplified by PCR for 16 cycles with primers PM2 and PM3 .
The PCR products were fractionated as described above to provide size markers for amplified fragments containing 12 , 13 , or 14 copies of the ( TG ) repeat .
Reverse transcriptase-PCR ( RT-PCR ) .
Fifteen leukemic specimens were identified that expressed TAL1 transcripts and were polymorphic at the ( TG ) , ; .
, , marker .
Five micrograms of RNA from each specimen was treated with 2 U of RNase-free DNaseI ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) and 80 U RNase inhibitor ( Promega ) in 50 mmol/L sodium acetate , 10 mmol/L MgCl1 ; , and 2 mmol/L CaCl ; ( final vol-ume , 40 gL ) at 37°C for 30 minutes .
The mixture was extracted once with phenol , followed by the addition of 1 ug oligo ( dT ) ; ; primer ( Promega ) , KCI to 100 mmol/L , and an additional 40 U of RNase inhibitor .
The primer was annealed to the RNA by incubation at 65°C for 10 minutes , 50°C for 10 minutes , and 40°C for 10 minutes .
After ethanol precipitation , the pellet was resuspended in 20 uL of 5 mmol/L MgC ) , 50 mmol/L KCI , 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl ( pH 9.0 ) , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 0.2 mmol/L each dNTP , 40 U of RNase inhibitor , and 8 U of avian myeloblastosis virus ( AMV ) RT ( Promega ) .
The reaction was incubated at 42°C for 30 minutes , 99°C for 5 minutes , and 5°C for 5 minutes .
An initial PCR amplification using 5 ul of cDNA was performed ( 100 L final volume ) with 0.5 pmol/L oligonucleotide PM2 , 0.5 umol/L oligonucleotide PMI ( 5'-GATTGCTTGAGCCCAGAGTT ) , and 2 U of Taq DNA polymerase in PCR buffer .
Twenty cycles of the PCR reaction were conducted at 94°C for 1 minute , 59°C for 1 minute , and 72°C for 1 minute .
PCR amplifications of genomic DNA and cDNA from each patient were then performed in parallel using an unlabeled PM2 oligonucleotide and a PM3 oligonucleotide with the fluorescent dye phosphora-midite , 6-FAM ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) , linked to the 5 ' end .

The TAL1-specific probe for the ribonuclease protection analysis includes 141 antisense cDNA residues that span the exon 5-exon 6 junction .
These residues are complimentary to the 3'-terminal 47 nucleotides of exon 5 and the 5'-terminal 94 nucleotides of exon 6 .
DNA was examined for tumor-specific TAL ] gene rearrangement by Southern analysis and PCR amplification .
As described in Table 1 , 10 of the 37 patients had TALI gene rearrangements , 8 of which arose by tal `` ' recombination .
During normal hematopoiesis , transcription of the TALI gene occurs in progenitors of the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mastocytic lineages . ``
'' The presence of these normal cells in BM aspirates from T-ALL patients could potentially confound the analysis of tumor-specific TAL ] expression , especially if RNA transcripts were measured by a PCR-based amplification method .
Instead , however , total cellular RNAs from the leukemic cells from each patient were evaluated for the presence of TAL ] transcripts using a ribonuclease protection assay .
Moreover , differential counts of the enriched mononuclear fractions showed that each sample contained fewer than 1 % erythroid and 5 % myeloid cells .
Although some samples had higher proportions of mature monocytes , previous studies have established that BM and PB monocytes do not express TAL ] gene products . ``
'' `` ' As illustrated in Fig 2 , TAL ] transcripts were not detected in leukemic specimens from several patients with T-ALL ( eg , patients no .
2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 10 ) .
Furthermore , BM-derived specimens from 3 patients with early B-lineage ALL were also evaluated and shown to be devoid of TAL ] transcripts ( Fig 3 ) .
These results show that Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation adequately removes normal TAL/-expressing progenitors from the leukemic fraction , at least to a degree sufficient for the analysis of RNA transcripts using a ribonuclease protection assay .
As expected , each of the 10 T-ALL patients with tumor-specific TALI gene rearrangements harbored TAL ] transcripts in their leukemic cells ( Table 1 ) .
However , TALI transcripts were also abundant in leukemic cells from a significant proportion of patients without apparent TAL ] gene alterations ( eg , patients no .
6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 ; see Fig 2 ) .
In total , 23 of the 37 patients showed TALI expression , including 13 that did not harbor TALL gene rearrangements ( Table 1 ) .
A polymorphic marker in the transcribed sequences of TALLI .
Ectopic expression of TAL ] in T-lineage cells may result from tumor-specific DNA alterations that affect one of the two TAL ] alleles .
These alterations in cis may arise from gross structural rearrangements such as those engendered by chromosome translocation or tal `` recombination or from more subtle changes such as point mutations in the regulatory sequences of TALI .
In either case , cis activation should induce monoallelic transcription of the TAL ] gene .
Alternatively , ectopic TAL ] expression may also occur as a result of tumor-specific changes in trans-acting factors that control TAL ] expression .
Although evidence for trans-acti-vation of the TALI gene in T-ALL has not yet emerged , this phenomenon is likely to induce biallelic TAL ] transcription .
To distinguish between monoallelic and biallelic TALZ expression , we sought to identify a polymorphism within the transcribed sequences of TAL ] .
Significantly , the 3'-untrans-lated region of exon 6 contains a simple repeat sequence that includes 12 tandem copies of the TG dinucleotide ( Fig 1 ) .
( TG ) , dinucleotide repeats , especially those of higher multiplicity ( ie , where n > 20 ) , are usually polymorphic in mammals . ``
To determine whether the ( TG ) , repeat in exon 6 of TAL1 is polymorphic , DNA fragments encompassing the ( TG ) , sequence were generated from the leukemic DNAs of 219 T-ALL patients by PCR amplification with a common pair of oligonucleotide primers ( PM2 and PM3 ) .
The PCR products were then fractionated by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels .
PCR amplification of leukemic DNAs from most patients produced a single DNA fragment ; molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis showed that this fragment contains 12 copies of the TG dinucleotide ( data not shown ) .
However , fragments of distinct sizes were also observed among the PCR products from some patients From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Therefore , to score the ( TG ) ; > ; , allele reliably in a large panel of T-ALL patients , PCR fragments containing 12 , 13 , or 14 copies of the TG dinucleotide were cloned into the pGEM4 plasmid vector .

ACTIVATION OF THE TAL ?
GENE the leukemic cells of patients no .
8 , 20 , 24 , and 36 ( Fig 7B ) .
RT-PCR artifacts are unlikely to account for these biallelic patterns , because such patterns were not observed in the 8 leukemia specimens bearing a detectable TALI gene rearrangement ( Fig 6 ) .
Thus , TAL ] transcription occurs in either a monoallelic or a biallelic manner in T-ALL cells that do not have obvious TALI gene rearrangements .
Does TALL gene activation occur in a majority of T-ALL patients ?
- Almost 25 % of T-ALL patients harbor tumor-specific DNA rearrangements that activate transcription of the TALI locus .
In this report , we show that TALL expression occurs in the malignant cells of more than 60 % of T-ALL patients , including many that are devoid of obvious TAL ] gene alterations .
We can not be certain that TAL ] expression in the latter subset of patients is a result of tumor-specific gene activation .
Nevertheless , several of these patients ( no .
29 , 32 , and 33 ) show a monoallelic pattern of TALZ expression similar to that found in leukemic specimens bearing a detectable TAL !
gene defect .
Hence , cis-activation of TALI in the primary leukemic cells of patients no .
29 , 32 , and 33 presumably results from more subtle alterations that similarly affect a single allele of the TALI gene in a tumor-specific manner .
These alterations might include local changes , such as point mutations , in the cis-acting regulatory sequences that normally control transcription .
Similarly , Leroy-Viard et al `` `` recently reported that monoallelic TAL ] transcription also occurs in Jurkat cells , an established T-ALL line that does not have an obvious alteration of the TAL ] gene .
Biallelic TAL ] expression was observed in the leukemic 673 cells of 4 patients that did not harbor an obvious TAL ] gene rearrangement ( patients no .
8 , 20 , 24 , and 36 ) .
Although the mechanism of TAL ] activation in this subset of patients is unclear , it presumably involves frans-acting factors that can induce transcription of both TAL ] alleles .
In this regard , it may be significant that several presumptive transcription factors have been implicated in T-ALL .
In addition to the TALl-related bHLH proteins ( TAL1 , TAL2 , and LYL1 ) , these include bHLH-zipper ( c-MYC ) , `` `` `` homeodomain ( HOX-11 ) , *** and LIM ( RBTN1/TTG1 and RBTN2 ) ** polypeptides that are also activated by tumor-specific chromosome translocations .
Some of these factors may have the ability to induce TAL ] expression in T cells , presumably in a biallelic fashion such as that observed in patients no .
20 , 24 , and 36 .
Although TALI activation would not be the primary genetic lesion in these patients , it may nonetheless play a critical role in the ensuing leukemogenesis .
The present study shows that TALI expression occurs in the malignant cells of most T-ALL patients .
Thus , despite the absence of a common cytogenetic defect , a majority of T-ALL patients ( > 60 % ) show transcriptional activation of either TALI or the related genes TAL2 and LYL1I .
Future studies will be required to ascertain whether the remaining T-ALL patients harbor other genetic lesions equivalent to TALL ] activation , or whether , in fact , these patients represent a distinct clinical subtype .
