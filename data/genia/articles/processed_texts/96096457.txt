Many cytokines activate signal transducer and activation of transcription ( STAT ) transcription factors , which , in turn , activate transcription of inflammatory effector genes .
We used mononuclear cell priming cultures and inflammatory synovial fluids ( SFs ) derived from arthritis patients to examine the regulation of cytokine production and STAT activity by an inflammatory synovial microenvironment .
Exposure to SFs during priming resulted in an 81 % inhibition of interferon ( IFN ) -y , but not interleukin ( IL ) 4 , production by effector cells generated in priming cultures .
SF suppression was mediated by IL-4 and IL-10 and inhibition of IL-12 expression , and it was reversed in a dominant fashion by exogenous IL-12 .
SFs blocked the sustained activity of transcription factor Stat1 , but not Stat3 , during the priming period , and Stat1 activity was differentially regulated by cytokines in parallel with their positive or negative regulation of IFN-y production .
Active Stat3 , but not Stat1 , was detected in cells from inflamed joints .
These results suggest a role for altered balance of Stat1 and Stat3 transcriptional activity in the regulation of T cell differentiation and in the pathogenesis of in flammatory synovitis .
Activation of cells and subsequent secretion of cytokines play an important role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases .
Predominant expression of either Th1 ( IFN-y and lymphotoxin ) or Th2 ( IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , and IL-10 ) cytokines has been associated with active inflammation ( 1 ) .
For example , Th1 cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of experimental allergic encephalitis ( 2 ) and collagen-induced arthritis ( 3 ) , whereas elevated Th2 cytokine production has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease ( 4 ) , autoan-tibody production ( 5 ) , and chronic arthritis associated with the caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus ( CAEV ) !
( 6 ) .
Patterns of cytokine expression during an immune response are controlled by a complex regulatory network that uses cytokines and factors derived from accessory cells and T cells ( 7 ) .
IL-12 and IFN-y are the primary stimulators of Th1 responses , whereas Th2 cytokine production is stimulated by IL-4 , IL-10 , and E series prostaglandins ( PGEs ) .
There is little in ' Abbreviations used in this paper : CAEV , caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus ; CM , complete medium ; MNC , mononuclear cell ; mRNA , messenger RNA ; PGE , E series prostaglandin ; SF , synovial fluid ; SIF , serum-inducible factor ; STAT , signal transductors and activators of transcription .
1825 formation available concerning which of these factors is important in regulating cytokine expression in inflammatory diseases .
Many cytokines that regulate immune responses activate specific members of the STAT ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) family of transcription factors ( 8 , 9 ) .
STAT 's exhibit differential binding to target sequences present in gene promoters , and the pattern of STAT 's that become activated determines , at least in part , patterns of gene expression and the phenotype of activated cells .
In experiments using cell lines , purified cytokines preferentially activate particular STAT 's by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 's by cytokine receptor-associated Jak kinases .
For example , IFN-y preferentially activates Stat1 , and IL-6 preferentially activates Stat3 ( 8 ) .
However , regulation of STAT 's in a more physiological setting is more complex and may involve regulation of STAT dephosphorylation ( 10 ) and serine phosphorylation ( 11 ) as well as regulation of Jak kinase activity by additional ligands ( 12 ) .
Thus , the pattern of activated STAT 's may reveal information about integrated cellular responses to multiple ligands .

© The Rockefeller University Press + 0022-1007/95/12/1825/07 $ 2.00 Volume 182 December 1995 1825-1831 resents an intensively studied process in which multiple cytokines are expressed and are likely to contribute to pathogenesis ( 13 ) .
The presence of high levels of Th2 cytokines and regulators , such as IL-10 , PGEs , and TGF-B , coupled with the low levels of IFN-y protein in actively inflamed joints ( 13-17 ) , suggests that down-regulation of Th1 cytokines may occur during synovitis ( 16 ) .
We studied the regulation of cytokine production and STAT activity using an in vitro priming system in which mononuclear cells ( MNC ) from peripheral blood are exposed to synovial fluids ( SFs ) from patients with inflammatory arthritis .
The aim is to reproduce existing conditions when blood mononuclear cells enter an inflamed joint and are exposed to a complex inflammatory microenvironment .
Culture with SFs resulted in the inhibition of Stat1 activity , with concomitant polarization of cytokine production toward a Th2 pheno- type .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Flow Cytometry .
- Ficoll density gradient-puri-fied peripheral blood MNC obtained from disease-free volunteers was stimulated with 1.3 ug/ml PHA in complete medium ( CM ; RPMI 1640 supplemented with glutamine and 5 % fetal bovine serum ) .
SFs or plasma controls were added at a final concentration of 30 % at the initiation of culture .
After 7 d , effector cells were harvested and washed , and 1.8 X 10° cells were restimulated in CM with 10 pg/ml PHA .
After culture , > 90 % of cells were viable , as assessed by trypan blue and propidium iodide staining , and cell surface phenotype was analyzed using flow cytometry .
The following purified mAbs were used .
T cell markers : 4B5 ( anti-CD3 ) , 13B8.2 ( anti-CD4 ) , and B9.11 ( anti-CD8 ) ; B cells : J4.119 ( anti-CD19 ) and BlLy.1 ( anti-€CD20 ) ; monocytes : IV.3 ( anti-CD32 monocyte-specific epitope ) and RMO52 ( anti-CD14 ) ; NK cells : 3G8 ( anti-CD16 ) and T1.99 ( anti-CD56 ) .
mAbs were purchased from Amac , Inc. ( Westbrook , ME ) , except for 4B5 ( Boehringer Mannheim Corp. , Indianapolis , IN ) and IV.3 ( Medarex , New Lebanon , NH ) .
IgG1 ( MOPC 21 ) and IgG2a ( UPC10 ) isotype controls were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. ( St. Louis , MO ) .
SFs .
- SFs were obtained , after receiving informed consent , from patients with seropositive definite or classic rheumatoid arthritis ( 11 SFs ) , or with chronic seronegative inflammatory arthritis ( 6 SFs ) , by the patients ' physicians for medically indicated reasons .
The protocol for obtaining research samples has been approved by the Institutional Review Board .
SFs were handled using sterile technique and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g to remove cells and particulate debris ; aliquots were stored at -80°C .
ELISA .
- Indirect ELISA was performed using specific mono-clonal capture antibodies anti-IFN-y ( Genzyme , Cambridge , MA ) and MP4-25D2 ( anti-IL-4 ; PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) and secondary antibodies anti-IFN-y ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) and 8D4.8 ( anti-IL-4 ; PharMingen ) , using the protocol provided by PharMingen .
All samples were tested in duplicate .
The values in Table 1 represent cytokine secretion per 10° CD3* cells , which was calculated using the following formula : ( measured cytokine secretion per 10° MNC + percentage of CD3* cells ) X 100 = cytokine secretion per 10° CD3 # * cells .
cDNA Preparation and PCR .
- RNA was prepared using RNA-zol ( TM Cinna Scientific , Friendswood , TX ) , and cDNA was obtained using 1 pug of total cellular RNA and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) .
1 or 5 % of each cDNA was subjected to 25 ( glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ) , 30 ( IL-2 ) , or 35 ( IL-12 p40 ) cycles of PCR am-plification , with 1 min denaturation at 94°C , 1 min annealing at 60°C , and 1.5 min extension at 72°C .
The GAPDH and IL-2 primers span introns and corresponds to primers provided by Stratagene ( La Jolla , CA ) , and the IL-12 p40 primer sequences are 5 `` GAA-GATGGTATCACCTGGAC and 5 GAAGAAGCTGCTGGT-GTAGT .
PCR resulted in single detectable amplification products of the correct size containing appropriate restriction sites .
Amplification was determined to be in the linear range by using serial dilutions of cDNA and different cycle numbers .
DNA-binding Assays .
- Cell extracts were prepared , and 8 pg of extract was assayed for binding to a radiolabeled hSIE oligonucleotide ( containing a STAT binding site ; reference 18 ) or to a control Sp1 oligonucleotide using gel shift assays , as previously described ( 17 , 18 ) .
Results SFs Skew Cytokine Production toward a Th2 Pattern .
- Priming of lymphocytes or MNC results in the generation of effector cells that exhibit an enhanced capacity to produce both Th1 and Th2 cytokines .
Addition of regulatory factors during the priming period results in skewing of cytokine production toward a Th1 or Th2 pattern ( 7 ) .
Table 1 shows the MNC cell surface phenotype and cytokine production , in our system , before and after 7 d of priming culture .
Priming was effective , because restimulation of effector cells , which were predominantly lymphocytes , on day 7 resulted in sevenfold more IFN-y production and 11-fold Table 1 .

- IFNy cultures were carried out ( 4 ) in CM plus 30 % plasma ( control ) or 30 % FS .
In ( B ) , CM was supplemented with 30 % plasma and TGF-B ( 20 ng/m ! )
IL-10 ( 20 ng/ ml ) , PGE , ( 107° M ) and 8-Br-cAMP ( 1 mM ) , IL-12 ( 20 ng/ml ) , control IgG ( 20 pg/ml ) , anti-IL-12 IgG ( 20 pg/ml ) , or anti-IFN-y IgG ( 20 pg/ml ) .
On day 7 , cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry ; 1.8 X 105 effector cells , containing comparable numbers of CD3+* and CD4* cells , were restimulated in CM with 10 pg/ml PHA .
Culture supernatants were harvested after 24 h , and cytokine levels were assayed by ELISA .
Cell viability ( > 90 % ) and cell surface phenotype ( the percentage of cells that were CD3 # , CD4 , CD8* , and CD19+* ) were comparable ; SFs IgG _ Anti- _ Anti decreased cell yield by 20 % .
Results obtained with the five most extensively tested SFs are shown ; SFs 1 and 4 were obtained from patients seropositive for rheumatoid factor , whereas SFs 2 , 3 , and 5 were obtained from seronegative patients .
16 out of 17 SFs { 11 patients seropositive for rheumatoid factor ) screened inhibited IFN-y production by > 60 % .
Data are shown as mean relative secretion of cytokines + SD compared with the control culture in each experiment .
The values are based on a minimum of ( 4 ) five or ( B ) three experiments with different donors .
more IL-4 production than stimulation of freshly isolated cells .
The effect of SFs , obtained from patients with active inflammatory arthritis , on the balance of cytokine production was tested next .
Treatment with SFs resulted in a mean 81 % inhibition of IFN-y production ( Fig .
1 A ; five representative SFs out of 17 tested are shown ) and a parallel inhibition of IFN-y messenger RNA { ( mRNA ) levels ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , priming for IL-4 synthesis was largely unaffected , because SF-treated cells secreted 49-86 % ( mean 74 % ) as much IL-4 as control cells .
Thus , treatment with SFs resulted in the preferential inhibition of IFN-y production , which is typical of a Th2 response .
Inflammatory SFs typically contain high levels of factors that can promote Th2 responses , such as IL-10 , PGEs , and TGF-B ( 13 , 14 ) and low levels of IFN-y ( 15-17 ) ; many contain no detectable IL-12 ( Ivashkiv , L.-B .
, unpublished data ) .
Next , to test whether any of these agents play an important or dominant role in regulating IFN-y production in our system , we added individual agents or neutralizing antibodies to the priming cultures ( Fig .
1 B ) .
The inhibitory effect of SFs on IFN-y production was mimicked by adding IL-10 or cAMP , or by neutralizing either IFN-y or IL-12 .
Thus , no one regulatory factor was dominant , and several different factors or mechanisms could mediate the SF effect .
Role of IL-4 , IL-10 , and IL-12 in Regulation of IFN-y Production by SFs .
_ SFs contain a complex mixture of cytokines that may have synergistic or antagonistic effects .
Furthermore , cytokines detected in SFs by immunological methods may be denatured or complexed to inhibitors and have no bioactivity ( 16 , 19 ) .
Therefore , rather than measuring cytokine levels or fractionating SFs to attempt to identify active mol-ecules , we used neutralizing antibodies to test the effect of blocking cytokine activity during the priming period .
Neutralization of both IL-10 and IL-4 during priming was required to reverse the SF inhibition of IFN-y production ( Fig .
2 A ) .
As expected ( 7 ) , priming for IL-4 production in 1827 Wang et al .
both control and SF-treated cultures depended on the presence of IL-4 during the priming period ( Fig .
2 B ) .
IL-10 is expressed in inflamed synovium ( 14 ) and inhibits production of several accessory cell-derived cytokines , including the Th1 stimulatory cytokine IL-12 ( 20 ) .
We investigated whether SF treatment resulted in a deficit in en-dogenous IL-12 activity in priming cultures .
SFs specifically suppressed induction of IL-12 mRNA during initiation of priming cultures , because treatment with SFs resulted in significantly lower levels of IL-12 but not IL-2 mRNA 3 h after stimulation ( Fig .
3 ) .
Addition of exogenous IL-12 to control cultures resulted in a modest stimulation of IFN-y production ( Figs .
1 B and 2 A ) , probably because endoge-nously produced IL-12 is present at near saturating levels in our culture system .
In contrast , addition of exogenous IL-12 to SF-treated cultures resulted in a dramatic ninefold induction of IFN-y production and a reversal of SF inhibition ( Fig .
2 , C and D ) .
Taken together , these results show that SF treatment resulted in a relative deficit in IL-12 ac-tivity .
Our results demonstrate that SFs regulated priming by modulating expression of several regulatory cytokines during the priming period .
Parallel Regulation of Stat1 Activity and Priming for IFN-y Production .
- Because many of the cytokines that regulate T cell differentiation activate STAT 's , we investigated the activation of STAT DNA binding activity during priming cultures by using gel shift assays .
Binding of three complexes of similar mobility to the hSIE oligonucleotide ( 18 ) was induced in control cultures , where priming for both IFN-y and IL-4 production occurs ( Fig .
4 , A , lane 4 , and C , lane 3 ) .
DNA binding was specific for the STAT sequence within the hSIE , derived predominantly from T cells , and was dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation ( data not shown ) .
STAT DNA binding activity was not detected until ~1 d after stimulation ; it peaked at 1-2 d and persisted over at least 3 d of priming culture ( Fig .

This result contrasts with the previously described rapid activation of STAT 's after treatment with high concentrations of purified cytokines ( 8 , 9 ) , which we could reproduce in our system ( Fig .

Peripheral blood MNCs were stimulated with 1.3 ug/ml PHA , and cells were harvested after 3 h , RNA extracted , and reverse transcribed into cDNA .
IL-2 , IL-12 p40 subunit , and mRNA levels were compared using semi-quantitative PCR , as described in Materials and Methods .
For each sam-ple , two different quantities of cDNA ( 5 and 1 % of cDNA obtained using 1 ug of RNA ) were subjected to PCR .
1828 STAT 's , but subsequent production of cytokines during culture results in a delayed activation .
The hSIE oligonucleotide used in our studies preferentially binds protein complexes that contain Stat1 and Stat3 , termed serum-inducible factor ( SIF ) A ( upper complex , which contains Stat3 ) , SIF-B { middle complex , which contains both Stat3 and Stat1 ) , and SIF-C ( lower complex , which is a homodimer of Stat1 ) ( 18 ) .
Because the STAT complexes induced during priming had an identical mobility to SIF-A , -B , and -C ( data not shown ) , we tested whether these complexes reacted with specific antisera against Stat !
or Stat3 ( 18 ) in supershift experiments ( Fig .
4 B ) .
The lower two complexes reacted with the Stat1 antiserum , whereas the upper two complexes reacted with the Stat3 antiserum .
Thus , priming resulted in the activation of Statl and Stat3 , and the complexes we have detected probably correspond to SIF-A , -B , and -C. Interestingly , treatment with SFs , which suppressed priming for IFN-y but not IL-4 production ( Fig .
1 A ) , resulted in the preferential suppression of the lower two complexes , which contain Stat1 , throughout the time course of the experiment ( Figs .
4 C and 5 A ) .
The inhibition of Stat1l activity was not secondary to down-regulation of Stat1 protein levels ( data not shown ) and thus reflected regulation of DNA binding .

IL-12 , IFN-y , and antibodies to IL-4 and IL-10 , which blocked SF inhibition of IFN-y production ( Fig .
2 and data not shown ) , also blocked SF inhibition of Stat1 activity ( Fig .
5 A , lanes 1-12 ) .
Furthermore , treatments that mimicked SF inhibition of IFN-y production , such as neutralization of IFN-y or IL-12 , or addition of cAMP ( Fig .
1 B ) , also inhibited Statl activity ( Fig .
5 A , lanes 13-15 ) but did not affect Stat1 protein levels ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that several factors differentially regulated the delayed phase of Stat1 activity in parallel with the differential regulation of Th1 and Th2 responses .
Patten of STAT Activity during Synovitis .
We investigated whether the pattern of STAT DNA binding activity detected in SF-treated cultures reflected the pattern of STAT activity in vivo during synovial inflammation .
Extracts prepared from cells freshly isolated from joint effusions of patients with inflammatory arthritis contained predominantly Stat3 but not Stat1l DNA binding activity ( Fig .
5 B ) .
This is consistent with the inability of several groups , including ours , to detect IFN-y protein in inflammatory arthritis ( 15-17 ) .

Modulation of STAT DNA binding activity by SFs and inflammatory stimuli .
( 4 ) Extracts from cells primed for 2 d in the presence of the indicated stimuli were assayed for binding to a radiolabeled hSIE oligonucleotide ( 18 ) .
The SFs , cytokines , and neutralizing antibodies were used as described in the legends to Figs .
1 and 2 .
( B ) hSIE binding by control extracts from IFN-y-stimulated monocytes ( which contain Stat1 ; reference 17 ) was compared with binding by extracts from synovial cells freshly isolated from inflamed joint effusions .
A representative extract from the six extracts tested is shown .
1 wl of a 1:10 dilution of each specific antiserum ( 18 ) was used .
In contrast , in delayed-type hypersensitivity , a Th1 response , active Stat1 is present in skin lesions ( 21 ) .
Discussion Relatively little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the balance of Th1 versus Th2 cytokine production during chronic human inflammatory diseases such as synovitis .
T cells that enter inflamed synovium are exposed to multiple agonists and antagonists that preexist in the joint or are produced by cells as they become activated .
We have investigated mechanisms regulating cytokine production using a culture system that attempts to mimic the complexity of regulation in vivo .
Our results show that soluble synovial inflammatory mediators specifically inhibit transcription factor Stat1 in PHA-activated T cells .
A functional correlate of Stat1 suppression is the inhibition of development of effector T cells that produce high levels of IFN-y .
Stat !
activity and IFN-y production were regulated in parallel by a cytokine regulatory network that involved IL-4 , IL-10 , and IL-12 and was modulated by SFs .
IL-4 , IL-10 , and IL-12 have previously been shown to regulate Th1 versus Th2 cytokine production ( 7 ) .
In many systems , IL-4 alone is sufficient to induce a Th2 response and is dominant over IL-12 ( 7 , 22 ) .
SF suppression of IFN-y production required IL-10 ( and inhibition of IL-12 ) in ad dition to IL-4 , and exogenous IL-12 restored IFN-y production in a dominant fashion .
These results suggest that accessory cell-derived factors , such as IL-10 and IL-12 , may play an important or dominant role in the regulation of T cell cytokine production during synovial inflammation .
The imbalance in cytokine production we have described reflects the pattern of cytokine expression in chronic human synovitis and CAEV -associated arthritis ( 6 , 13 ) .
Th2 cytokines can contribute to pathogenesis by driving synovial production of antibodies and formation of immune complexes , or by inducing expression of metalloproteases ( 23 ) and inflammatory mediators , such as soluble CD23 ( 24 ) .
Alternatively , Th2 cytokines may contribute to pathogenesis by suppressing Th1-mediated clearance of ( auto ) antigens or inappropriately activated cells ( 25 ) .
Statl activity in priming cultures was differentially regulated by SFs , cAMP , IL-4 , IFN-y , and IL-12 ( Figs .
4 and 5 ; Wang , F. , unpublished data ) .
This antagonistic regulation of a STAT factor by several opposing cytokines represents a novel mechanism for modulating STAT signaling and allows Stat1 to function as a cellular `` node `` that integrates multiple signals into a transcriptional response .
The block of Stat1 activity could be achieved by preventing production of the cytokine , which directly activates Stat1 , interruption of intracellular signals upstream of Stat1 activation ( 12 ) or activation of Stat1-specific tyrosine phosphatases .
At this time , it is not clear which cytokine directly activates Statl in priming cultures .
Stat1l can be activated by many cytokines , including IFN-y , IFN- , IL-2 , IL-6 , platelet-derived growth factor , and epidermal growth factor ( 8 , 9 ) .
The absence of Stat1 activity in the presence of neutralizing anti-IFN-y antibodies ( Fig .
5 A ) suggests that IFN-y may be the responsible cytokine .
However , persistence of Stat1 activity over several days would be atypical after IFN-y ac-tivation , and culture supernatants contained very low levels of IFN-y immuno- and bioactivity ( Ivashkiv , L. B. , unpublished data ) .
This suggests that IFN-y may act indirectly or that alternative mechanisms , such as regulation of Stat1 de-phosphorylation , may be important .
Our previous work showed that SFs directly activate , in monocytes , a DNA-binding complex that contains Stat3 but not Statl ( 17 ) .
The new results demonstrate that SFs use a different mechanism , namely , inhibition of Stat1 , to achieve a similar skewing of the balance of transcriptional activity in activated T cells .
Stat3 binds weakly to the Stat1 target sequences in several promoters and does not activate transcription of promoters containing these sites in cotransfection assays ( reference 26 ; Zhong , Z. , unpublished data ) .
Thus , SF-treated lymphocytes will probably express Stat3 target genes in the absence of expression of genes whose transcription depends on Statl .
The altered balance of Stat3 and Stat1 transcriptional activity correlates well with the altered balance of cytokine production and was also detected in cells from inflamed joints ( Fig .
5 B ) .
These results suggest a role for Stat1l and Stat3 in the regulation of the development of Th phenotype and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory synovitis .
