7 Involvement of Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases in the Signal Transduction Pathway for Interleukin-1 MARCIO CHEDID anp STEVEN B. MIZEL* Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Wake Forest University Medical Center , Winston-Salem , North Carolina 27103 Received 13 November 1989/Accepted 30 March 1990 Expression of a highly specific protein inhibitor for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) -responsive cells blocked IL-1-induced gene transcription that was driven by the c immunoglobulin enhancer or the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat .
This inhibitor did not affect protein kinase C-mediated gene transcription , suggesting that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases are involved in the signal transduction pathway for IL-1 in a number of responsive cell types .
Cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) is an important intracellular second messenger in the induction of gene transcription by several hormones ( 1 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 16 , 21-23 ) .
Mellon et al .
( 9 ) demonstrated that overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A ( PKA ) can induce the expression of cAMP-responsive genes , supporting the concept that phosphoryla-tion is a required event in cAMP-mediated gene expression .
In several instances , the linkage between cAMP , PKA , and activation of specific genes is mediated via one or more DNA-binding proteins that recognize a conserved cAMP-responsive element ( 10 , 11 , 14 , 22 ) .
For example , Montminy and Bilezikjian ( 10 ) have characterized a 43,000-molecular-weight phosphoprotein which binds with high affinity to the cAMP-responsive element of the rat somatostatin gene .
Whitehouse and Walsh ( 23 ) have characterized and purified a heat-stable skeletal muscle protein that specifically inhibits cAMP-dependent protein kinases but that has no effect on cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases or protein kinase C ( PKC ) .
This inhibitory protein ( termed PKI ) is a high-affinity inhibitor that competes with substrates for the binding to the catalytic subunit of PKA .
Based on the amino acid sequence of this inhibitor ( 16 ) , Grove et al .
( 6 ) generated an expression plasmid containing the cDNA that encodes the active portion of the skeletal muscle protein inhibitor ( the N-terminal 31 amino acids ) .
Transfection of this recombinant inhibitor into cells specifically decreased the cAMP-induced expression of a cotransfected reporter gene .
In previous reports we have demonstrated that interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , a potent mediator of immune and inflammatory responses , stimulates the production of cAMP in a variety of responsive cells ( 4 , 20 ) .
We also found that several IL-1-mediated responses such as interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor a expression , induction of k immunoglobulin light-chain syn-thesis , and stimulation of thymocyte proliferation are mimicked by cAMP analogs and cAMP-elevating drugs ( 4 , 20 ) .
The IL-1 receptor is coupled to adenylate cyclase via a pertussis toxin-sensitive , adenylate cyclase-stimulatory G protein ( 4 ) .
In addition , IL-1 ( 15 , 18 , 19 ) and cAMP analogs ( 18 , 19 ) can induce the activation of NF- « B , a DNA-binding protein that exhibits specificity for DNA sequences present in the regulatory regions of several genes , including the IL-2 receptor « -subunit gene , k immunoglobulin light-chain gene , and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat ( 2 , 5 , 8 , 12 , 13 , 18 ) .
Furthermore , we have * Corresponding author .
3824 also found that PKA , as well as PKC , can induce the in vitro activation of NF-KB as well as its translocation into isolated nuclei ( 19 ) .
Although these in vitro observations are consistent with a role for PKA in IL-1 signal transduction in vivo , it was essential to demonstrate this point with intact cells and a highly specific method for inhibiting the activity of PKA .
Construction and expression of PKA inhibitor oligonucleo-tide .
An approach similar to the strategy of Grove et al .
( 6 ) was used to investigate the involvement of PKA in the signal transduction pathway for IL-1 .
A cDNA fragment encoding the N-terminal 31 amino acids of the PKA inhibitor described by Scott et al .
( 16 ) was prepared by first synthesizing two sets of oligonucleotides , 74 ( A ) and 72 ( B ) base pairs in length , that contained a BamHI ( A ) or Bgilll ( B ) restriction site .
The individual oligonucleotides of each set were purified and annealed .
The oligonucleotide pairs were digested with Sfil ( to create the appropriate cohesive ends for ligation of the A and B oligonucleotides ) and ligated .
The ligated oligonucleotide was then digested with BamHI and Bg/II and cloned into the Bg/lI site of pSV2Zneo ( pSV 2neo-PKI ) .
Following transformation of Escherichia coli MM294 , pSV Zneo-PKI was purified and digested with NarlI , and the insert ends were filled in by using the Klenow fragment of DNA poly-merase I. Bg/ll linkers were blunt end ligated to the insert followed by digestion with Bg/II .
A 197-base-pair insert was purified and cloned into the Be/I site of the expression vector pSBL ( 3 ) ( kindly provided by Brian Grinnel , Lilly Research Laboratories ) .
Plasmids containing the PKA inhibitor in the sense ( pSBL-PKIs ) and antisense ( pSBL-PKIas ) orientations were used in transfection studies Involvement of PKA in the signal transduction pathway for IL-1 .
Our initial experiments focused on the role played by PKA in the activation of the xk immunoglobulin gene enhancer in the pre-B-cell line 702/3 .
Cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method with ExCAT ( a plasmid that contains the Vk21E gene enhancer and promoter sequences linked to the reporter gene choramphenicol acetyltransferase [ CAT ] ) ( 2 ) and cultured for 48 h in the presence of different stimuli .
In confirmation of our earlier work ( 18 ) , we found that IL-1 and forskolin , a potent activator of adenylate cyclase , stimulated an increase in CAT activity ( Fig .
1A ) .
In addition , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , a PKC activator , also promoted an increase in CAT activity .
No CAT activity was detected when 702/3 cells were transfected with an enhancer-lacking construct ( E-CAT ) and stimulated with Vor .

Effect of PKA inhibitor protein expression on IL-l-induced gene transcription in 70Z/3 cells .
( A and B ) 70Z/3 cells ( 4 x 10 `` ) were transfected with 10 pug of the ExCAT plasmid ( A ) or E-CAT ( B ) and an equal amount of the carrier plasmid pBR322 by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously ( 19 ) .
After transfection , cells were cultured for 48 h with medium only , 2 x 10~ `` M human IL-1a , 3 uM forskolin , or 50 ng of PMA per ml .
( C and D ) 70Z2/3 cells ( 4 x 10 `` ) were cotransfected with equal amounts ( 10 ug of each plasmid DNA ) of ExCAT and pSBL-PKIs ( C ) or ExCAT and pSBL-PKlas ( D ) by the DEAE-dextran method .
After transfection , cells were cultured with medium only , 2 x 107 `` M human IL-l « , 3 M forskolin , or 50 ng of PMA per ml for 48 h. CAT activity was assayed by thin-layer chromatography .
Acetylated forms of chloramphenicol were detected by scanning the plates with a radioanalytic imaging system ( Ambis Systems , San Diego , Calif. ) .
The relative increase in CAT activity in stimulated cultures was calculated relative to the CAT activity in cultures incubated in medium only .

IL-1 , forskolin , or PMA ( Fig .
1B ) .
In order to investigate the participation of PKA in the activation of the xk enhancer , 70Z/3 cells were cotransfected with ExCAT and pSBL-PKIs plasmids and cultured for 48 h in the presence of IL-1 or the cAMP-inducing agent forskolin .
As shown in Fig .
1C , the ability of IL-1 to induce gene transcription was abolished in cells transfected with pSBL-PKIs .
However , when 702/3 cells cotransfected with ExCAT and pSBL-PKIs were stimulated with PMA , CAT activity was observed .
These results indicated that the PKI was not acting in a nonspecific manner , since PKC-mediated responses were unaffected ( compare Fig .
1A and C ) .
When 702/3 cells were cotransfected with ExCAT and pSBL containing the PKA inhibitor insert in the antisense orientation ( pSBL-PKIas ) , no significant inhibitory activity was observed ( Fig .
1D ) .
Cotransfec-tion of 70Z2/3 cells with pSBL-PKIs or pSBL-PKIas and pRSV-CAT did not result in a level of CAT activity that was different from that obtained with cells transfected with only pRSV-CAT ( data not shown ) .
Taken together these results indicate that cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( s ) is involved in the in vivo activation of the k enhancer in response to IL-1 .
We extended these studies to two other IL-l-responsive cell lines , the human natural killer cell line YT that is induced by IL-1 to express the IL-2 receptor a subunit ( 20 ) and the murine thymoma cell line EL 4 6.1 C10 that produces IL-2 in response to IL-1 ( 14 ) .
In YT cells , transcriptional activation of HIV-1 has been shown to be mediated by NF- « B ( 14 ) .
When YT ( Fig .
2A ) and EL 4 ( Fig .
3A ) cells were transfected with HIV-1-CAT , IL-1 and PMA independently induced CAT expression .
It should be noted , however , that PMA and IL-1 did not act synergistically when 3826 NOTES RELATIVE INCREASE IN CAT p _u M L1 _ PMA RELATIVE INCREASE IN CAT ACcTMTY N _ t M IL1 _ PMA RELATIVE INCREASE IN CAT ACTMTY b __ t M L1 FIG .

Effect of PKA inhibitor protein expression on IL-1-induced gene transcription in YT cells .
( A ) YT cells ( 1.4 x 10° ) were transfected with 1.4 ug of plasmid HIV-1-CAT and an equal amount of the carrier plasmid pBR322 and cultured for 48 h in the presence of medium , 2 x 10~ `` M human IL-1 « , or 10 ng of PMA per ml .
( B ) A second sample of YT cells ( 1.4 x 10° ) was cotransfected with equal amounts of HIV-1-CAT and pSBL-PKIs plasmids ( 1.4 ug of DNA from each plasmid ) and cultured for 48h in the presence of medium , human IL-l- « , or PMA ( same concentrations as given above ) .
( C ) cells ( 1.4 x 10° ) cells were also cotransfected with equal amounts of HIV-1-CAT and pSBL-PKIas ( 1.4 ug of DNA from each plasmid ) and cultured as described above .

10 , 1990 they were added together to cultures of HIV-1-CAT-trans-fected cells ( data not shown ) .
When the cell lines were cotransfected with HIV-1-CAT and pSBL-PKIs and stimulated with IL-1 , CAT activity was markedly reduced ( Fig .
2B and 3B ) , suggesting that PKA is involved in the activation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat by IL-1 .
In contrast , when YT and EL 4 cells cotransfected with HIV-1-CAT and pSBL-PKIs were stimulated with PMA , CAT activity did not significantly differ from that seen with cells transfected with HIV-1-CAT only ( Fig .
2B and 3B ) .
As would be expected , pSBL-PKIas had no effect on IL-1 activity ( Fig .
2C and 3C ) .
The presence of pSBL-PKIs or pSBL-PKIas in the cells did not affect CAT expression from the pRSV-CAT plasmid ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that in the pre-B-cell line 70Z2/3 , the natural killer cell line YT , and the T-cell line EL 4 6.1 C.10 , PKA is involved in a signal transduction pathway for IL-1 that is linked to the activation of gene transcription .
On the basis of our previous findings ( 19 ) , it is quite likely that PKA is directly involved in the activation of specific transcriptional factors such as NF- « B .
