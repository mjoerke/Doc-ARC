We have cloned the mouse and human GATA-1 genes .
A region upstream to the first exon , and highly conserved between mouse and man , acts as an erythroid specific enhancer in transient assays , if linked to the GATA-1 or to the SV40 promoter .
The activity of the enhancer is almost completely dependent on the integrity of a dimeric GATA-1 binding site .
INTRODUCTION The expression of proteins characteristic of differentiated cells is thought to require subsets of transcription factors , which are either exclusively present or selectively enriched in these cells .
Recent studies identified in mammalian erythroid cells at least two such factors : GATA-1 ( 1-4 ) and NFE2 ( 5 ) .
These factors are involved in the regulation of several major genes expressed in erythroid and/or megakaryocytic cells , including globin , porphobilinogen deaminase and erythropoietin receptor ( 6-10 ) .
In addition , GATA-1 is essential for the development of the erythropoietic system ( 11 ) .
To understand the molecular basis for the restricted expression of GATA-1 , we have studied the -flanking region of the mouse GATA-1 gene .
Here we describe an upstream erythroid specific enhancer , that binds strongly to GATA-1 itself , and whose activity is almost entirely dependent on the integrity of the GATA-1 binding site .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Mouse and human DNA library screening A library of partially digested Mbol fragments from BALB/C mouse DNA inserted in phage EMBL3 ( 12 ) was screened by standard methods using a cDNA fragment from nucleotide 76 to nucleotide 329 of the published cDNA sequence ( 3 ) .
A human genomic library in phage lambda FIX ( Stratagene ) was screened with a human GATA-1 cDNA .
Primer extension The experiments were carried out essentially according to ref .
13 .
Appropriate primers were 5'terminally labelled with [ y° > -P ] ATP ( Amersham , 3000 Ci/mmole ) , using T4 polynucleotide kinase .
Primers ( 0.15-0.50 ngs ) were annealed to total ( 30 ugs ) or polyA* RNA ( 1 ug ) from mouse erythroleukemic cells ( MEL ) and from NIH3T3 fibroblasts in 25 uls of 80 % formamide , containing 40 mM PIPES ( pH 6.4 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 0.4 M NaCl at 30°C for 15-18 hrs .
Following ethanol precipitation , the primer-RNA hybrids were reverse transcribed and the reactions processed according to ref .
13 .
The samples were analyzed on 6 % polyacrylamide-8M urea gels .
RNAase protection analysis ( 7,13 ) A 405 nt BamHI fragment of the mouse GATA-1 gene , extending ( Fig.4 ) from the most 5 `` part of the first intron into the first exon and the 5 ' -flanking region was cloned into the BamHI site of the pGEM7 plasmid .
A *P-labelled 458 nt .
long antisense RNA probe , spanning the entire fragment and extending into the plasmid , was obtained by transcribing with SP6 polymerase the plasmid linearized by digestion with HindIII .
Total RNA from MEL and NIH3T3 cells ( 20 ugs ) was hybridized for 18 hrs to the RNA probe ( ~ 0.5-2 x 106 cpm ) at 39-45°C in 30 uls of 80 % formamide , 0.4M NaCl , 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4 , 1ImM EDTA , and then digested for 30 mins at 30°C in 300 uls with RNAase A and Tl ( 40 pgs/ml and 1 ug/ml , final concentration , respectively ) , followed by proteinase K digestion and phenol-chlorophorm extraction .
Gel electrophoresis was in standard 6 % acrylamide , 8M urea gels .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay Nuclear extracts from exponentially growing cells were prepared exactly according to ref .
14 , in the presence of leupeptin , aprotinin and pepstatin .
5'-end labelled oligonucleotides ( top or bottom strand ) were annealed with an excess of the complementary oligonucleotide [ 15 ] and repurified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
In vitro binding of nuclear protein to DNA and electrophoretic runs were according to refs .

19 oligonucleotide , 1-5 ugs of nuclear protein , 3 ugs of poly ( dI-dC ) , 2 ugs of bovine serum albumin in a buffer consisting of 4 mM spermidine , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.9 , 1 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF .
When purified factors were used instead of crude extracts , 100 ngs poly ( dI-dC ) /reaction were used .
Unlabelled competitor oligonucleotides were as specified in figure legends .
Incubation was at 20°C for 30 ' .
Gel electrophoresis was in 50 mM Tris borate pH 8.2,1 mM EDTA , 5 % polyacrylamide gels at 10 V per cm for 2-3 hours .
The GATA oligonucleotide used in these experiments comprised nucleotides -718 to -685 of the mouse GATA-1 gene .
Three mutated versions of this oligonucleotide were also used : 5'-mutation : TGA to GTC ( -708 to -706 ) 3'-mutation : TC to CA ( -696 to -695 ) 5'+3 ' mutation ( this is the same oligonucleotide as that used for the mutagenesis of the GATA-1 enhancer ) .
Bacterially synthesized GATA-1 A Ncol-EcoRI fragment from the human GATA-1 cDNA was inserted into the E.coli expression vector pAR 3040 NcoI , digested with NcoI and EcoRI .
The hybrid protein consists of 11 N-ter .
phage residues in frame with the complete GATA-1 coding sequence .
The expression of the recombinant protein was induced in transformed E.coli BL 21 cells by IPTG .
GATA-1 was extracted by the method of inclusion bodies , solubilized by 6 M Guanidinium HCl and renaturated by dialysis .
Plasmids for CAT assay A fragment of the mouse GATA-1 promoter , comprising nucleotides -312 to -31 , was obtained by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using oligonucleotides ( 1 and 2 , see below ) ending with Hind IH linkers and was ligated into the Hind III site of the pSVo CAT plasmid ( 18 ) to generate pSVo-GATA .
A fragment of the mouse upstream conserved region ( from nucleotide -856 to nucleotide -655 ) , ending into BamHI linkers , was also obtained by PCR , using oligonucleotides 3 and 4 ( see below ) , and ligated either into the BamHI site 3 ' to the CAT gene of the pSVo-GATA plasmid , or into the BamHI site located exactly at the 5'-end of the GATA-1 promoter fragment of the same plasmid .
The upstream GATA-1 fragment was also inserted at the 3 ' BamHI site of the pSV 1 CAT plasmid ( 18 ) or upstream to the SV40 promoter in a modified version of the pSV1CAT plasmid generated exactly as described in ref .
18 , with the further addition of Bglll linkers ( into which the fragment was inserted ) .
A mutated version of the upstream GATA-1 fragment was obtained by PCR ( 19 ) .
An oligonucleotide containing the mutated sequence ( in the sense orientation ) was used to amplify the region from nucleotide -718 to nucleotide -655 ( in conjunction with oligonucleotide 4 ) .
The complementary version of the same mutated oligonucleotide was used , in conjunction with oligonucleotide 3 , to amplify the region from position -856 to -685 .
The amplified fragments were purified by acrylamide gel electrophoresis , mixed in equimolar amounts , denatured and further amplified using only oligonucleotides 3 and 4 , resulting in the desired full size fragment containing the expected mutation .
Oligonucleotides 1 and 2 encompass nucleotides -312 to -291 ( sense ) and -31 to -52 ( antisense ) ; oligonucleotides 3 and 4 nucleotides -856 to -837 ( sense ) and -655 to -674 ( antisense ) .
The sequence of the mutated oligonucleotide ( -718 to -685 ) is shown below in its sense version ( mutated nucleotide in bold characters ) .

1x 10U937 cells were electroporated in a volume of 0.4 ml at 250 V , 960 uF , in the presence of 20 ugs of plasmids .
Hep3B and HeLa cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation , using 15 ugs of plasmids .
At least two independent preparations of each plasmid were tested .
Two days after transfection ( one day in the case of U937 ) the cells were lysed ( 15 ) .
Aliquots of lysates , containing equal amounts of protein , were assayed for CAT activity by measuring conversion of '4C-chloramphenicol to acetylated forms ( by thin layer chromatography ) and to the butyrylated form ( by phase extraction ) [ 20 ] , as described in ref .
7 .
Some experiments were carried out in the presence of a -galactosidase reporter plasmid , as previously described ( 21 ) .
Results obtained in the absence of this plasmid , or in its presence and normalized on the basis of its activity , were essentially identical .
RESULTS Homology between the 5'-flanking regions of mouse and human GATA-1 genes Sequencing of mouse GATA-1 genomic clones ( Fig .
1 ) indicates that the 5'-untranslated part of the cDNA sequence is split by an intron .
The initiator ATG lies in the second exon 20 nucleotides downstream from the boundary between first intron and exon : the most 5'-nucleotide of the previously published cDNA sequence lies in the first exon at position -49 relative to the first exon-intron boundary .

The two major transcription start sites are indicated by arrows .
Recognition sites for DNA binding proteins are indicated by underlining ; a GATA motif is shown in bold characters .
The asterisk marks the end of the previously published cDNA sequence ( 4 ) .
Similarly , the initiator ATG lies in the secon exon of the human GATA-1 gene , 19 nucleotides downstream from the intron-exon boundary .
The 5'-flanking region of the mouse GATA-1 gene shows a high level of homology to the corresponding region of the human gene up to mouse position -235 , where the two sequences start to diverge .
Homologous fragments , interrupted by gaps and insertions , are detected up to position -355 , where the two sequences completely diverge .
However , a highly homologous region ( ~ 90 % ) is detected further upstream ( between mouse nucleotides -665 and -760 ; the corresponding region in the human gene is underlined in Fig .
2 ) .
Multiple transcription initiation sites upstream to the first exon of the mouse GATA-1 gene To identify the CAP site , we carried out primer extension experiments on RNA from mouse erythroleukemic cells ( MEL ) using primers corresponding to either the second exon or the first exon and putative flanking sequences ( Figs .
3A and 4A ) .
Two major CAP sites and several clustered minor sites are detected .
Identical CAP sites are identified with three different primers mapping on the first exon , indicating that in this region the mRNA is colinear with the 5'-flanking sequence .
The same CAP sites are also identified with a primer mapping on the second exon , showing that the large majority , if not all , of the transcripts originate 5 ' to the first exon ; the only possible exception is a site defined by a ~ 320 nt band , representing < 5 % of all start sites , that is visible only with a primer mapping on the second exon , and only using polyA* RNA .
The location in the first intron , or elsewhere , of this minor start site has not been investigated .
No visible extension was obtained using fibroblast ( NIH3T3 ) RNA with primers 1-4 in accordance with the erythroid specificity of the GATA-1 RNA .
To independently verify the primer extension results .
RNAase mapping experiments were carried out ( Fig .
3B ) using an RNA probe starting in the first intron , and extending into the first exon and 5'-flanking region ( Fig .
4B ) .
Using MEL RNA , multiple protected bands are observed ; qualitatively identical results are obtained by hybridizing at a range of temperatures between 39° and 45° , and by digestion of the hybrids at various RNAase concentrations ( Fig .
3B ) .
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts do not show any band , in agreement with primer extension experiments .
Overall , there is a very precise concordance between CAP sites detected by primer extension experiments and those indicated by RNAase -820 Tce trrrorr recorererer ormeommec Tatcocact ~740 corcaageaatcarcooreecrorcacercaermreooscorecansccaccareeceecacaagaasrreaceccacte ~660 Tcooresqrertooracceccacaceoercacccommeacaccerermactocescoccaacasccaceerceccracarc ~580 ~500 xc aat aaccatatc ~420 TAMGGGCTTTACTC TTTCATTTATCTTIGGTTICAGCCTAT ~340 TrrGcr A cc ~260 -180 caccase Arceceras ~100 crececal +1 +20 G/GT ... intron .

A : Primer extension .
The location of primers on the cDNA sequence and the region where transcription start sites are located , are indicated .
Position -111 marks the nucleotide corresponding to the end of the published human GATA-1 cDNA .
The data are based on 5 experiments with primers 1 and 3 , and 3 experiments with primers 2 and 4 .

The SP6 transcribed probe is shown ; sequences belonging to the intron are dotted .
Protected sequences are indicated by a solid line , unprotected sequences by a broken line .

Triangles indicate the positions of CAP sites mapped by primer extension , circles the positions of sites mapped by RNAase protection .
Solid symbols : strong sites ; open symbols : weak sites .
Note that from the primer extension data colinearity between mRNA and genomic sequence must extend at least up to the 5'end of primer 1 .
If colinearity were interrupted upstream to this position , all the resulting RNAase protected bands should be shorter than expected ( contrary to the observed results ) .
protection experiments ( Fig .
4 ) ; some additional fainter bands might either represent minor start sites undetected by primer extension or degradation fragments .
Ubiquitous nuclear proteins bind in vitro to the proximal 5'-flanking region of the mouse GATA-1 gene As indicated in Fig .
1 , the 5'-flanking region contains multiple canonical ( GGGCG ) ( 22 ) and variant ( GGGAG ) ( 23 , 24 ) potential binding sites for the ubiquitous factor Sp1 .
In addition , two well conserved CACCC boxes , which are also known ( 25 , 26 ) to bind ubiquitous factors , including Sp1 , are present just upstream to the CAP sites region .
Fig .
5 shows a representative nuclear protein binding experiment using a labelled fragment from the CACCC box region from nucleotide -312 to nucleotide - 191 , in a gel shift assay .
The fragment generates several retarded bands , one of which ( indicated by a closed square ) comigrates with the major band obtained using oligonucleotides derived from the SV40 promoter and from a mutant ( ~198 T-C ) y-globin promoter , which are known to bind efficiently to purified Sp1 ( and to other ubiquitous proteins ) ( 24-26 ) ( Figure 5A , lanes 4 and 9 ) .
Excess unlabelled y-globin fragment or Sp1 oligonucleotide efficiently compete ( lanes 7 and 8 ) all the major bands , including the slower ones , generated by the GATA-1 promoter fragment , as well as by the ~y-globin promoter ( lane 10 ) .
An asterisk denotes a band generated by the -198 oligonucleotide that is not due to Sp1 ( 24 ) and is not generated by the GATA-1 fragment ( lane 9 ) .
In contrast , an unrelated oligonucleotide from the y-globin CCAAT box region ( 24 ) does not complete the GATA-1 bands .
These data suggest that the band comigrating with that generated by the y-globin and the SV40 oligonucleotides represents the binding of a single Sp1 molecule , while the slower bands are due to the additional binding of other Sp1 molecules and/or of different proteins .
To test these possibilities , highly purified Sp1 , obtained by affinity chromatography ( 22 , 24 ) , was used , originating bands comigrating with the major bands obtained with the crude extract Figure 5 .

Binding of an oligonucleotide from the upstream conserved region of the murine GATA-1 gene to nuclear proteins from K562 cells and to GATA-1 .
Labelled oligonucleotides used for gel shift assays are indicated below the figure and unlabelled competitor oligonucleotides , if present , above the figure .
A : binding of the oligonucleotide from the upstream GATA-1 gene conserved region ( GATA ) ( nucleotides -718 to -685 ) .
Competitors are : & , a GATA-1 binding oligonucleotide from the mouse -globin promoter ( 27 ) ; GATA , and its mutated version ( see Materials and Methods ) added at 50 , 120 and 300-fold molar excess .
B : Binding of the GATA oligonucleotide and of an oligonucleotide from the y-globin promoter .
This oligonucleotide binds either GATA-1 or OTF-1 ( 27 ) .
Lanes 1-6 : 3 ugs of nuclear proteins ; lanes 7-9 : 7 pgs .
Unlabelled a-competitor was at a 50 ( lane 2 ) , 150- and 300-fold ( lanes 8 , 9 ) molar excess ; GATA-1 ( lane 3 ) at 50-fold excess , and mutated GATA-1 at 50-200-fold excess .
C : Bacterially synthesized GATA-1 was added to oligonucleotides GATA , mutated GATA and y-globin ( lanes 3-5 ) .
Lane 1 , y-globin oligonucleotide ; lane 2 GATA with 2 ugs of K562 nuclear proteins .
D : bacterially synthesized GATA-1 was added to the normal GATA oligonucleotide , to a 3'-mutated and to a 5'-mutated GATA-1 oligonucleotide ( lanes 1-3 ) .
The band running ahead of the major GATA-1 band is a known degradation product ( 1 , 3 , 8 ) .
( compare lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Thus , the GATA-1 promoter fragment binds Spl ( and possibly other ubiquitous proteins ) , generating multiple retarded bands , which correspond to the binding of one or more Spl molecules .
We have further confirmed these conclusions using overlapping sets of oligonucleotides individually encompassing the CACCC boxes and the major clusters of Spl motifs ( data not shown ) .
In addition , identical results are obtained either using erythroid or non erythroid nuclear extracts ( Figure 5B ) .
A strong conserved GATA-1 binding site in the upstream 5'-flanking region of the GATA-1 gene The high degree of conservation between mouse and man of the -665 to -760 region prompted an investigation of its DNA binding properties .
These experiments identify a region showing erythroid -specific binding .
A duplicated , inverted GATA motif , perfectly conserved between mouse and man ( Figures 1 and 2 ) is present in this region .
An oligonucleotide including this motif yields a band comigrating with the GATA-1 band generated by a previously well characterized ( 27 ) y-globin oligonucleotide ( Figure 6A ) .
The band generated with the labelled oligonucleotide from the GATA-1 gene can be competed either by a strong GATA-1 binding oligonucleotide ( mouse -globin promoter , see ref .
27 ) or by the GATA-1 gene oligonucleotide itself , at ratios indicating that the site in the GATA-1 gene is stronger than that in the -globin promoter ( compare lanes 2-6 in Figure 6A ) .
Similarly , the GATA-1 band generated with the labelled y-globin oligonucleotide is more efficiently competed by unlabelled GATA-1 gene oligonucleotide than by « -globin oligonucleotide ( Figure 6B , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Additionally , a mutant GATA-1 gene oligonucleotide failed to compete for binding , indicating the specificity of the interaction ( Figure 6B , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
When the binding reaction with the GATA-1 gene oligonucleotide is carried out at low concentrations of nuclear extract ( 1 to 3 ugs of protein ) , a single retarded band is observed ; however , already at 7 ugs a strong , slower band is additionally detected , that is also competed efficiently by unlabelled GATA-1 binding oligonucleotides ( Figure 6B , lanes 6-9 ) .
This band might be due either to a complex between GATA-1 and a different protein , or represent the binding of two GATA-1 proteins to the same molecule .
To address this point , we used bacterially synthesized human GATA-1 protein ; this protein generates a single band of the expected mobility when using the y-globin GATA-1 binding oligonucleotide , that is known to bind a single GATA-1 molecule ( 8 , 27 ) .
Using the GATA-1 gene oligonucleotide , 'bacterial ' GATA-1 generates both the expected and the slower bands ; no binding is observed with the mutant oligonucleotide ( Figure 6C ) .
If the 3'-GATA-1 motif only is destroyed , the fragment generates only the fast , but not the slow , band ( Figure 6D , lane 2 ) , indicating that the 5 motif is still able to bind GATA-1 ; on the other hand , the mutation of the 5'-motif is sufficient to abolish or greatly reduce the binding ( Figure 6D , 5290 Nucleic Acids Research , Vol .

Relative CAT activities in erythroid K562 cells of reporter plasmids containing or not the conserved upstream GATA-1 gene region .
The fragment ( E ) was linked in the orientation indicated by the arrow to either the pSV 1 plasmid or to the pSVo plasmid driven by a GATA-1 gene promoter fragment .
The mutations introduced into the GATA-1 binding site are shown .
The results are averages + standard deviations , from 4-12 experiments .
The activities of pSV 1 or of pSVo-GATA plasmids , transfected in parallel experiments to the other tested constructs , were taken to represent activity = 1 .
Note that the activity of pSVo-GATA is 2.5 fold lower than that of pSVo without any added promoter and that the activities of the enhancer-containing constructs ( pSV 1 + E and pSVo-GATA + E ) are 2-5 fold higher than those of constructs containing an overactive y-globin promoter ( -175 T-C HPFH , see ref .
7 ) .
lane 3 ) .
These results indicate that che 3'-motif may be weak , and that GATA-1 may cooperatively bind to it only after one molecule of GATA-1 has bound to the 5'-motif .
This interpretation is supported by DMS interference experiments .
In fact , when the binding experiment is carried out at low protein concentration , to generate a single band , methylation of the G at positions -707 ( top strand ) and -709 ( bottom strand ) strongly interferes with binding , while methylation at positions -700 and -695 ( bottom strand ) has a smaller effect ( data not shown ) .
This dimeric GATA-1 site is the only one we have detected in ~ 900 nucleotides of upstream sequence .
A GATAGACAG sequence exists immediately upstream to the CACCC boxes of the mouse , but not the human , gene ; this sequence , binds a different , ubiquitous protein , but not the erythroid GATA-1 protein ( not shown ) .
The distal conserved region has erythroid specific enhancer activity Transfection experiments in which fragments of the 5'-flanking region , extending up to position -600 , linked to the CAT-reporter gene , were introduced into erythroid or non erythroid cells , consistently failed to demonstrate any activity of the GATA-1 promoter .
However , when a fragment including the upstream conserved region is linked to a ~ 300 nucleotide promoter fragment of the GATA-1 gene , it greatly stimulates the activity of the gene in erythroid KS562 cells .
The effect is similar , whether the distal region is placed 5 ' or 3 ' to the promoter , and independent of the orientation ( Figure 7 ) .

The results are averages + standard deviations , from 4 experiments .
To evaluate whether the enhancing effect requires the cooperation with a specific sequence of the promoter , the distal region was also linked to the SV40 promoter ( minus enhancer ) region of the pSV 1 plasmid ; the stimulation is the same as obtained when the distal region is linked to the GATA-1 promoter .
The activity of the enhancer is almost completely dependent on the GATA-1 binding site ( Figure 7 ) ; a mutation of this site , preventing the binding of GATA-1 ( Figure 6 ) , abolishes the activity of the enhancer .
Finally , the activity of the enhancer is restricted to erythroid cells ( Figure 8 ) .
In transfection experiments using epithelial carcinoma HeLa , hepatoma Hep3B and monocytic U937 cells , the activities of the pSV 1 constructs containing the enhancer were very low and similar , or only slightly higher ( 2-4 fold ) , than those of the control constructs without the upstream region .
Additionally , the low level of stimulation obtained with some constructs was not dependent on the GATA motifs , as it was also observed with the construct containing the mutant GATA-1 motif .
The pSVo-GATA constructs were completely inactive .
DISCUSSION In mammals , GATA-1 has been detected in normal erythroblasts ( 1 , 9 ) , megakaryocytes ( 9 , 10 ) , mastcells ( 9 ) , as well as in several cell lines belonging to these lineages .
In addition , certain non-transformed early myeloid cell lines also express GATA-1 , at levels that are inversely proportional to the degree of maturation of these cells ; treatment with myeloid growth factors of some of these cells leads to decreased GATA-1 expression ( 21 ) .
These data have led to the suggestion that the GATA-1 gene may be first activated in a common progenitor to some or all of these lineages ( 9 , 10 , 21 ) , and then differentially regulated ( maintained or extinguished ) in the differentiated progeny ( 21 ) .
To elucidate this complex regulation , we have cloned the mouse ( and human ) GATA-1 genes , and started a search for regulatory elements by dissecting the 5'-flanking region .
The proximal 5 ' -flanking region is structurally similar to that of a typical 'ubiquitous ' promoter , lacking TATA and CCAAT boxes , and containing several binding elements for Sp1 and other ubiquitous factors ( Figures 1 , 2 , 5 ) , immediately upstream or interspersed with multiple transcription initiation sites ( Figures 3 , 4 ) .
Not surprisingly , it has little or no activity , per se , in transfection experiments ( Figure 7 ) .
In contrast , the upstream region has a strong enhancer activity ( Figure 7 ) .
Its conservation between mouse and man argues in favour of an 'in vivo ' role for this enhancer .
The enhancer has a strong GATA-1 binding motif ( Figure 6 ) and its activity in erythroid cells is almost completely dependent on the integrity of this motif ( Figure 7 ) .
In non-erythroid cells , the enhancer , whether normal or mutated , is substantially inactive ( Figure 8 ) .
In addition to the erythroid GATA-1 protein , other partially tissue restricted or ubiquitous GATA binding proteins have been recently discovered ( 28 , 29 ) .
We do not know whether these new proteins bind to the enhancer sequence , and we can not presently rule out the possibility that one or more of these proteins participate in the erythroid activity of the enhancer .
However , the very low activity of the enhancer in several types of non erythroid cells , as well as its lack of dependence on the GATA motif in these cells , strongly argue that non erythroid GATA-binding proteins do not play a significant role , per se , in the activity of the enhancer .
Rather , we suggest that GATA-1 , by binding to one or both sites in the enhancer , may be involved in the maintenance or stimulation of the activity of the GATA-1 gene , following its initial activation in the unknown progenitor .
Other GATA-1 binding sites in the first intron ( unpublished ) might also cooperate in this modulation .
These data do not address the problem of the initial , and perhaps transient , events that activate , or derepress , the GATA-1 gene .
Understanding whether the distal enhancer , or other as yet unidentified regions , are involved in this event requires further investigations and the utilization of hematopoietic progenitor cell lines .
Recently , a study of the promoter of the chicken GATA-1 gene has appeared ( 30 ) .
The chicken promoter resembles the mouse promoter in lacking a TATA box and showing multiple transcription start sites .
Cotransfection experiments indicate that GATA-1 may regulate , in conjunction with other unidentified factors , this promoter .
Interestingly , however , the major GATA-1 binding sites are in close proximity to the CAP sites ( both 5 ' and 3 ' in the first intron ) , in contrast with the distant upstream location of the enhancer in the mouse and human genes .
This raises the possibility that the DNA region interposed between the minimal promoter and the enhancer in the mouse and human genes may have evolved new regulatory functions .
After we submitted this paper , an other study of the mouse GATA-1 promoter has been reported ( 31 ) .
Using a promoter assay , a moderate ( ~ 4-fold ) effect of the distal GATA-1 binding motif on erythroid expression was demonstrated .
