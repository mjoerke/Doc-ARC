NEOPLASIA Constitutive Activation of NF-B in Primary Adult T-Cell Leukemia Cells By Naoki Mori , Masahiro Fujii , Shuichi Ikeda , Yasuaki Yamada , Masao Tomonaga , Dean W. Ballard , and Naoki Yamamoto Human T-cell leukemia virus type | ( HTLV-I ) is an etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) .
The viral protein Tax induces the activation and nuclear translocalization of transcription factor NF- « B , which is proposed to play a crucial role in the transformation of T cells by HTLV-I .
However , the HTLV-I genes including Tax are not expressed significantly in primary leukemic cells from ATL patients .
In this study , we examined the basis for NF- « B activation in freshly isolated leukemic cells from ATL patients .
We found that leukemic cells from ATL patients , like HTLV-l-infected T-cell lines , display constitutive NF-kB DNA binding activity and increased degradation of ( an inhibitor of NF-kB ) .
Whereas DULT T-CELL leukemia ( ATL ) is a highly aggressive T-cell malignancy etiologically linked to a retrovirus , human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) .
As the viral genome does not encode a known oncogene `` or promote cis-activation of endogenous proto-oncogenes by site-specific integration , `` the events leading to the occurrence and progression of this hematologic disease remain to be elucidated .
A 40-kD nuclear oncoprotein , termed Tax , appears to be responsible for the transforming features of HTLV-I .
HTLV-I Tax is a potent transcriptional activator of the HTLV-I long terminal repeat , `` as well as numerous cellular genes involved in T-cell activation and growth , such as those encoding interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) `` * and the a chain of IL-2 receptor ( IL-2Ra ) .
! ``
Because Tax does not bind DNA directly , Tax appears to induce cellular target genes indirectly via host cellular pathways , `` including activation of the family of transcription factors .

proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm as latent precursors by their inhibitor , IxBa . ``

0006-4971/99/9307-0015 $ 3.00/0 2360 the NF-kB binding activity in Tax-expressing T-cell lines consisted mostly of p50/ c-Rel , fresh ATL samples contained p50/ p50 and p50/p65 heterodimers .
One T-cell line derived from ATL leukemic cells , TL-Om1 , displayed constitutive activity , as well as enhanced degradation of despite the lack of detectable Tax expression .
Interestingly , the NF- « B in TL-Om1 consists of p50/ p50 and p50/ p65 like that in fresh primary leukemic cells .
Our results suggest that activation of NF- « B occurs through a Tax-independent mechanism in leukemic cells of ATL patients , possibly due to differential NF-kB subunit activation .

Subsequent to cellular activation and through proteolytic degradation of IxBa , NF-kB is released and translocates to the nucleus where it transactivates several genes , including IxBa itself . ``
'' Recent studies have shown that Tax induces the degradation of IxBa , which may contribute to constitutive activation of NF- « B in HTLV-L-infected T-cell lines . ``
'' Although NF-kB is known to be constitutively activated in Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines , the activation status of NF-KB in leukemic cells from ATL patients remains unclear .
Some of the genes that can be transactivated by Tax are constitutively expressed in leukemic cells from ATL patients .
On isolation , ATL cells spontaneously display surface IL-2Ra `` and express mRNA for cytokines including IL-1 « , `` > * IL-18,2 > 2 IL-6,2 % 2 `` IL-8 , `` IL-9 , `` IL-10 , `` ° tumor necrosis factor B , `` transforming growth factor 3 , * > > `` and parathyroid hormone-related protein .
`` * `` `` Among them , genes for IL-1 @ , `` ° IL-6 , * `` IL-8,2 `` and tumor necrosis factor B `` `` harbor the xB enhancer element and Tax activates transcription of these cellular genes through NF-KB binding site .
However , primary leukemic cells isolated from ATL patients typically express Tax mRNA and protein at low levels , if at These findings imply that there is another mechanism independent of Tax underlying the overexpression of several cellular genes in fresh ATL cells .
In this study , we examined the activation of NF- « B and IxBa in leukemic cells isolated from ATL patients and in control cells from healthy subjects .
Tax expression in the primary cells isolated from these patients was hard to estimate quantitatively with Northern and Western blot analyses .
We found evidence for constitutive degradation of IxBa protein , increased nuclear expression of NF-KB , and increased expression of IxBa mRNA in ATL cells .
Also , TL-Om1 , which does not express Tax at all , still exhibits constitutive NF-KB binding activity , composed of p50 and p65 , as seen in ATL cells .
These observations suggest Tax-independent mechanisms operating for constitutive NF-kB activation in leukemic cells from ATL patients .

NF-kB ACTIVATION IN ATL JPX-9 is a derivative of Jurkat cells carrying the transfected Tax gene under the control of metallothionein promoter . ``
Expression of Tax was induced by adding 20 pmol/L CdC ] ; into the medium .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from 7 patients , 5 with acute-type ATL ( patients 3 to 7 ) and 2 with chronic type ATL ( patients 1 and 2 ) ,4 were analyzed .
The diagnosis of ATL was based on clinical features , hematologic characteristics , the presence of serum antibodies to ATL-associated antigens , and the presence of the HTLV-I proviral genome in DNA from leukemic cells PBMC were isolated by Ficoll/Hypaque ( Pharmacia LKB , Uppsala , Sweden ) by density gradient centrifugation .
Each patient had more than 90 % leukemic cells in the blood at the time of analysis .
Detection of IL-2Ra-positive cells .
The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 0.1 % NaN ; and mixed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated murine monoclonal antibody to the a chain of the human IL-2R .
After incubation for 30 minutes at 4°C , they were washed with PBS containing 0.1 % NaN3 and then analyzed using a FACScan ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) .
Northern blot analysis .
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Trizol method as described by the manufacturer ( GIBCO-BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
Twenty micrograms of RNA was electrophoresed through a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nylon mem-brane .
Membranes were prehybridized ( 0.5 mol/L sodium phosphate , 0.1 % bovine serum albumin , 7 % sodium dodecyl sulfate [ SDS ] , 100 ug/mL salmon testis DNA , and 100 ug/mL yeast RNA ) for 2 hours at 65°C and then hybridized overnight with the following [ a- `` °P ] radiolabeled probes : cDNA of human IL-2Ra ( kindly provided by Dr T. Taniguchi , Tokyo University , Tokyo , Japan ) , `` glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , and HTLV-I Tax .
Radiolabeled probes were generated by using a Megaprime DNA Labeling system ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Western blotting .
The antibody used in these experiments was rabbit polyclonal antibody to IxBa « , C-21 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Cells were lysed by incubation in radio-immuno-protein-assay ( RIPA ) buffer ( 0.5 % sodjumdeoxycholate , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.1 % SDS , 66 ug/mL aprotinin , 100 ug/mL phenyImethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate ) for 30 minutes at 4°C .
Equal amounts ( 50 ug ) of protein from cell lysates were electrophoresed on 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes .
The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline-Tween ( 0.05 % ) with 3 % nonfat dried milk overnight at 4°C and then blotted for 45 minutes with the antibody .
The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline-Tween and incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit immunoglobulin ( Amersham ) .
Thereafter , membranes were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents ( Amersham ) and exposed to film .
Oligonucleotides .
- The sequence of the oligonucleotide corresponding to the xB element from IL-2Ra « gene was 5'-gatcCGGCAGGG-GAATCTCCCTCTC-3 ' . ``
Underlined sequences represent the < B motif .
The oligonucleotide , 5'-gatcTGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3 ' , containing the consensus sequence of the octamer binding motif ( underlined ) was used to identify specific binding of the transcription factor Oct-1 .
This transcription factor regulates transcription of a number of so-called housekeeping genes .
For competition studies , oligonucleotides containing mutant xB and two xB motifs derived from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) were used , and the sequences are 5'-gatcCGGCAGatctATCTC-CCTCTC-3 ' and 5'-gatcACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTT CCAG-3 ' , respectively .
For the preparation of a probe in electrophoretic ability shift assay ( EMSA ) , a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was prepared by annealing and filling in the overhang with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [ e- `` P ] deoxycytidine triphosphate ( dCTP ) and [ « -P ] deoxyadenosine triphosphate ( dATP ) .
2361 Preparation of nuclear extracts .
- Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Antalis et al `` `` with modifications .
Cells ( 10 `` ) were washed twice with cold PBS and the cell pellet was suspended in 400 uL of hypotonic buffer A ( 10 mmol/L HEPES , pH 7.9 , 10 mmol/L KCI , 0.1 mmol/L EDTA , 0.1 mmol/L EGTA , 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 2 mmol/L aminoethyl-benzenesulfonyl fluoride [ AEBSF ] , and 0.2 % Nonidet P-40 ) for 10 minutes at 4°C .
Nuclei were prepared by microcentrifugation for 5 minutes at 4°C .
The nuclear pellet was suspended in 75 uL of buffer C ( 20 mmol/L HEPES , pH 7.9 , 0.4 mol/L NaC ] , 1 mmol/L EDTA , 1 mmol/L EGTA , 1 mmol/L DTT , 2 mmol/L AEBSE , 33 ug/mL aprotinin , 10 ug/mL leupeptin , 10 ug/mL E-64 , and 10 ug/mL pepstatin A ) and incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C with brief mixing .
The mixture was microcentrifuged ( 15,000 cpm ) for 15 minutes at 4°C .
Protein concentration was measured by using the Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) .
EMSA .
- As previously described , `` nuclear extracts ( 5 ug of protein ) were preincubated in a 20-uL total reaction volume containing 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 50 mmol/L NaCl , 1 mmol/L EDTA , 1 mmol/L DTT , 5 % glycerol , and 1 ug of polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycyti-dylic acid ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) for 15 minutes at room temperature .
The reaction mixture was then incubated with the radiolabeled oligonucleotide ( 50,000 cpm ) for 15 minutes at room temperature .
The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 4 % nondenatur-ing polyacrylamide gel with 0.25 X TBE buffer ( 22.3 mmol/L Tris , 22.2 mmol/L boric acid , and 0.5 mmol/L EDTA ) .
The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography .
Plasmids and transfection .
- A reporter plasmid « B-LUC ( a kind gift from Dr J. Fujisawa , Kansai Medical University , Osaka , Japan ) was constructed by inserting five repeats of the NF- « B binding sequence of the IL-2Ra gene fused to an enhancerless promoter of HTLV-I into pGL2-Basic containing the luciferase gene , dN-LUC . ``
' The NF- « B expression plasmids , human p50 , p65 , and c-Rel , were the generous gifts of Dr K. Yamamoto ( Kanazawa University , Kanazawa , Japan ) .
Transfections were performed by electroporation . ``
'' In all cases , the reference plasmid pRL-CMV , which contains the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer/ promoter , was cotransfected to correct for transfection efficiency .
For luciferase assay , the transfected cells were lysed in a lysis reagent ( Toyo Ink Co , Tokyo , Japan ) , and luciferase activities were measured according to the manufacturer 's procedures .
Each assay was independently repeated at least three times .
RESULTS HTLV-L-infected T-cell lines constitutively express a factor mediating activation of NF-xB element .
- As an initial test of the activity of NF-kB in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines , a transfection analysis was performed using a reporter construct , containing a luciferase gene under the control of the NF-kB binding site from the IL-2Ra gene .
The level of luciferase activity detected in uninfected cells transfected with « B-LUC was similar to that of cells transfected with dN-LUC ( Fig 1A ) .
On the other hand , in all of the five HTLV-I-infected cell lines , the reporter gene was 9 to 13 times more active than dN-LUC , indicating enhanced NF-kB activity in HTLV-I-infected cell lines .
Among five HTLV -- infected cell lines , four ( MT-2 , HUT-102 , SLB-1 , C5/MJ ) expressed high levels of HTLV-I Tax transcript .
In contrast , the TL-Om !
1 cell line `` failed to express significant amounts of Tax at the mRNA level ( Fig 1B ) .
TL-Om !
1 did not express Tax mRNA at all by a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction method coupled with reverse tran-scription . ``
These results suggest that Tax is not required to From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Various cell lines were transfected with 10 pg of a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene fused to five repeats of the « B motif of the IL-2R « gene and enhancerless promoter of HTLV-I ( « B-LUC ) .
After 24 hours of incubation , lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity .

maintain NE-kB-dependent transcription in HTLV-l-infected T-cell lines .
Potential alterations in cellular gene activation associated with the Tax-independent activation of NF-KB in TL-Om|1 were next studied by measuring expression of the IL-2Ra protein and its mRNA .
Like the other four Tax-expressing cell lines , TL-Om !
1 expressed IL-2Ra on its surface ( Fig 2A ) .
In addition , constitutive expression of the 258 and 168 forms of IL-2R « MORI ET AL mRNA `` was detected in TL-Om1 , as well as the other four HTLV -- infected cell lines , whereas it was not in uninfected cell lines ( Fig 2B ) .
These results showed that TL-Om1 has a Tax-independent constitutive expression of the IL-2Ra gene , possibly due to the activation of NF- « B .
Lower protein levels of IxBa in HTLV -- infected T-cell lines .
In a variety of cell lines , NF-KB is localized in the cytoplasm through binding to specific cytoplasmic molecules called IxBa .
After cellular stimulation by multiple inducers , activation of signal transduction cascades leads to the degradation of IxBa .
In agreement with prior studies , `` `` the protein level of IxBa was significantly lower in HTLV-I-infected cell lines ( Fig 3A ) .
More importantly , TL-Om1 cells , which do not express Tax , have reduced IxBa protein at a similar level to HTLV-I-infected cell lines expressing Tax .
These results suggest that IxBa protein expression is downregulated in TL-Om1 by a Tax-independent mechanism .

Overexpression of IxBa mRNA in HTLV-L-infected T-cell lines .
Next , we performed Northern blot analysis of IxBa mRNA in the T-cell lines characterized above .
As shown in Fig 3B , the expression of IxBa mRNA in TL-Om1 , as well as Tax-expressing cell lines , was strikingly higher than in uninfected ones .
Thus , decreased IxBa protein level detected in HTLV-L-infected cell lines , including TL-Om !
1 , is not due to impaired IxBa gene activity , but due to the rapid turnover of IxBa .
It has been reported previously that Tax disrupts feedback regulation of NF- « B through destabilization of thus establishing constitutive activation of NF- « B .
JPX-9 cells are derived from a human T-cell line Jurkat , and they are permanently transfected with a metallothionein promoter-driven Tax expression vector . ``
'' As a result of the expression of Tax in JPX-9 cells by CdC ] ; treatment , IxBa mRNA expression was markedly upregulated ( Fig 4A ) .
However , the total protein 2363 levels for IxBa remained constant ( Fig 4B ) , possibly indicative of a more rapid turnover of IxBa .
Taken together , these results show that Tax-mediated destabilization of IxBa is the mechanism for reduction of IxBa protein in HTLV-I-infected cell lines expressing Tax .
These data also suggest that rapid degradation of IxBa is maintained by mechanisms other than Tax in TL-Om !

Enhanced IxBa degradation in primary ATL cells .
We had postulated that the IxBa « /NF- « B pathways may already be activated in ATL leukemic cells in vivo .
Therefore , we examined whether the expression of IxBa in freshly obtained PBMC of ATL patients is upregulated .
PBMC were isolated from peripheral blood of seven ATL patients and RNA was prepared for Northern blot analysis .

Expression of IkBa « at mRNA ( A ) and protein ( B ) levels in primary leukemic cells from ATL patients and normal healthy subjects .
( A ) Total RNA was extracted from PBMC and assessed for IkBa , IL-2R « , or GAPDH mRNA expression .
A representative Northern blot is shown from patients with ATL and healthy subjects ( normal ) .
( B ) PBMC obtained from patients with ATL or healthy subjects ( normal ) were assessed for IkBa by Western blot analysis .
levels in freshly isolated PBMC of ATL patients were much higher than those in PBMC from healthy control subjects .
Furthermore , IL-2Ra expression was stronger in primary ATL cells than in normal PBMC ( Fig 5A ) .
These results are similar to the high expression of IxBa and IL-2Ra mRNA observed in HTLV -- infected T-cell lines .
In addition , Tax expression in the primary cells isolated from these patients was hard to estimate quantitatively with Northern and Western blot analyses ( data not shown ) .
We next determined the protein levels of IxBa in blood mononuclear cells from patients with ATL and from healthy subjects .
Whole-cell extracts were prepared from PBMC and subjected to Western blot analysis ( Fig 5B ) .
The IxBa reactivity band was strongly visible in PBMC from healthy subjects .
In contrast , IxBa reactivity was weak in PBMC derived from two cases ( ATL patients 5 and 6 ) .
The remaining five samples did not show apparent reduction of the bands .
However , these results were not influenced by the contents of leukemic cells in MORI ET AL these samples .
While IxBa mRNA levels were dramatically upregulated in ATL cells , the total protein levels did not increase , possibly indicative of protein degradation .
Constitutive NF-xB binding activity in HTLV -- infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells .
To determine whether degradation of IxBa protein in HTLV-l-infected T-cell lines was associated with NF- « B activation , nuclear extracts of cells were subjected to EMSA .
In uninfected T-cell lines , no NF-kB specific protein DNA complexes were detected in nuclear extracts by EMSA ( Fig 6A , lanes 1 through 3 ) .
In contrast , enhanced NF-KB activity was present in each of the HTLV -- infected T-cell lines tested ( Fig 6A , lanes 4 through 8 ) .
The specificity of the binding activities was shown by competition with excess wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides ( data not shown ) .
Constitutive NF-kB binding activity in MT-2 cells was composed predominantly of c-Rel and p50 , as antibodies against c-Rel and p50 partially inhibited formation of the DNA complex and also produced a shifted complex ( Fig 6B , left panel ) .
Similar analyses showed that c-Rel and p50 subunits represented the main DNA binding components in HUT-102 , SLB-1 , and C5/MJ cells ( data not shown ) .
In TL-Om !
1 cells , two forms of complexes were detected ( Fig 6A ) .
Incubation of the nuclear extracts with various antibodies represented that the upper band contains p50 and p65 , and the lower band contains only the p50 ( Fig 6B , right panel ) .
We determined whether degradation of IKBa protein in primary ATL cells involved abnormal NF- « kB-specific DNA binding activity .

Activation of NF- « B in primary ATL cells .
( A ) Nuclear extracts ( 5 pg ) from PBMC from patients with ATL or from healthy subjects ( normal ) were assessed for activation of NF- « B by EMSA .
The right panel represents a lighter exposure of patients 2 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .
( B ) Nuclear extracts from patients with ATL or from healthy subjects ( normal ) were analyzed for protein binding to the octamer consensus sequence by EMSA .
( C ) Nuclear extracts from patient 3 sample were coincubated with 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides and assessed in parallel .
( D ) Nuclear extracts were preincubated with NF-B subunit-specific antibody , as indicated above each lane , before the addition of radiolabeled probe ( as in Fig 6 ) .
to EMSA .
In extracts from healthy subjects , complex was detected ( Fig 7A , left panel ) .
This protein DNA complex was composed primarily of p50 ; interaction with anti-p65 , c-Rel , and p52 antibodies was negligible ( Fig 7D , right panel ) .
On the other hand , two forms of complexes were detected , an upper band and a lower band in extracts from primary ATL cells ( Fig 7A , left panel ) .
Although the observed complexes formed broad bands in patients 2 , 5 , 6 , and 7 , lighter exposure of the gel showed two bands in these cases ( Fig 7A , right panel ) .
The specificity of these complexes was verified by competition with an excess of wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides ( Fig 7C ) .
Incubation of the protein DNA complex with anti-p50 resulted in almost complete supershift of the upper and lower migrating bands ( Fig 7D , left panel ) .
Incubation with anti-p65 reduced only the upper band completely .
Further , anti-c-Rel and p52 antibodies failed to shift any bands ( Fig 7D , 2365 left panel ) .
This result suggests that the upper band contains p50 and p65 , and the lower band contains the p50 homodimers .
No differences between ATL patients and healthy subjects in binding to the octamer motif on DNA were found ( Fig 7B ) .
Transactivational activities of different members of the family at the IL-2Ra kB site .
To determine the transcription activity of different subunit members of the NF- « B/Re !
family , expression plasmids for three kB-related proteins , p50 , p65 , and c-Rel , were cotransfected in Jurkat cells with a reporter plasmid , kB-LUC .
As shown in Fig 8 , expression of p65 and c-Rel , by themselves or in combination with p50 , led to an increase in luciferase activity , while expression of p50 was devoid of effect on the reporter gene transcription .
These results recapitulate the observed EMSA and IL-2Ra « expression data , indicating that p65 or c-Rel binding can activate NF- « kB-dependent transcription .
However , p50 homodimers can bind to the kB element in the IL-2Ra , but are unable to support transcriptional activation .
DISCUSSION We analyzed for the first time the functional status of the pathway in primary leukemic cells from ATL patients .
In all patients , protein 's DNA binding activity was detected by EMSA in the leukemic cell extracts .

Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation with a reporter plasmid ( 5 pg ) containing the luciferase gene fused to five repeats of the « B motif of the IL-2R « gene and enhancerless promoter of HTLV-I ( B-LUC ) along with combinations of the cDNA expression plasmids encoding p50 ( 5 pg ) , p65 ( 5 mug ) , and c-Rel ( 5 mg ) indicated at the bottom of the panel .
After 24 hours of growth , cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity .
Increase of the luciferase activity in cell extracts is shown relative to that after parental plasmid transfection .
The mean + standard error of mean ( SEM ) for three independent assays is presented .

2366 already undergone proteolytic degradation .
IxBa mRNA was upregulated in ATL cells of patients .
However , IxBa protein levels did not increase in concert with the highly elevated expression of the mRNA .
Furthermore , IxBa protein levels were significantly lower in two samples .
Thus , increased turnover of the IxBa protein in leukemic cell extracts of patients with ATL was associated with activation of NF-kB .
These results were similar to those observed in HTLV-I-infected and Tax-expressing T-cell lines .
Recently , like IKBa , Tax-mediated breakdown of IxBB was reported . ``
In preliminary experiments , little or no detectable amount of IBB was found in primary ATL cells .
Together , these results suggest that the degradation of IxBa and IKBB may play a role in the constitutive activation of NF-kB in ATL .
Importantly , the identity of the shifted bands was confirmed by supershifting with NF- « B-specific antibodies .
We observed that the dynamic alterations in NF-KB binding activity occurred in ATL patients .
In all patients ' extracts , the DNA protein complex consists of p50/p65 heterodimers and p50 homodimers .
In contrast , NF-kB binding activity in healthy subjects was composed of p50 homodimers alone .
Interestingly , cotransfection with various NF-kB subunits indicated that p65 and c-Rel , but not p50 , was able to activate transcription at the IL-2Ra « B site .
The observation that constitutive binding of heterodimeric p50/p65 correlated with expression of IL-2Ra in ATL patients supports the notion that in vivo p50/p65 heterodimers and p50 homodimers can bind to the kB element in the IL-2Ra « promoter , but only p50/p65 heterodimers can activate transcription .
HTLV-I Tax has been shown to induce a degradation of IxBa , which may contribute to induce the nuclear expression of a number of NF- « B/Re !
l species . ``
'' NF-KB is known to mediate the Tax-dependent transactivation of IL-2R « , !
* `` 4 IL-1 , `` TL-6 , * `` IL-8 , `` and tumor necrosis factor B genes . ``
'' Considering the previously reported enhanced production of these inflammatory cytokines `` > 426283 `` and the increased expression of surface molecules such as IL-2R « & `` in leukemic cells of ATL patients , it is not surprising that activated NFP- « B/IxBa pathway was seen in ATL cells .
However , consistent with previous studies , `` * `` `` primary leukemic cells isolated from ATL patients did not express Tax at a significant level .
Because viral expression in vivo differs significantly from that observed in cell lines in vitro , it is of interest to understand the differences of NF-kB activation between leukemic cells in vivo and cell lines established in vitro .
Tax induces predominantly the c-Rel-containing complexes `` and transcriptionally activates the c-Rel gene . ``
Consistent with these studies , in HTLV-L-infected T cells that constitutively express high levels of Tax , p50 and c-Rel were the major DNA binding components ; similar c-Rel containing complexes were also observed previously , ' `` `` > `` suggesting Tax-independent mechanisms by which primary ATL cells exhibit persistent nuclear expression of p50/p65 heterodimers .
In this study , we have shown that the ATL-derived TL-Om1 cell line fails to express detectable levels of Tax .
However , TL-Om1 was shown to carry full-length proviral genome of HTLV-I by Southern blot analysis . ``
'' It was also found that the HTLV-I LTR function was not enhanced in TL-Om1 , as the LTR luciferase activity in TL-Om|1 was one fourteenth of that in MORI ET AL MT-2 .
Furthermore , Tax induced transcription from the LTR in TL-Om1 ( data not shown ) .
We have also shown the rapid degradation of IxBa in TL-Om1 cells , which may be directly involved in constitutive NF-kB activation .
This line still expresses IL-2Ra mRNA and protein at high levels .
In addition , TL-Om !
1 cells express chemokine genes such as IP-10 and 1309 , and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 at the same levels as those in Tax-expressing T-cell lines infected with HTLV-L.45° These results suggest that Tax is not the only mechanism for constitutive expression of certain cellular genes in T cells .
We believe in the possibility of Tax-independent mechanisms operating for constitutive activation in leukemic cells of ATL patients .
TL-Om1 should help to identify new targets of NF-kB by comparing gene expression between this cell line and other Tax-expressing cell lines .
