Young , * and John R. Ortaldo'* IL-13 , a cytokine similar to IL-4 , is a regulator of human B cell and monocyte functions .
Biologic effects of IL-13 on primary human NK and T cells have not been well defined .
We demonstrate that , in primary NK cells , IL-13 , but not IL-4 , may induce low levels of IFN-y secretion .
When NK cells were costimulated with IL-13 and IL-2 , IL-13 generally resulted in two types of reactivity : IL-13 synergized with IL-2 to stimulate IFN-y production or it modestly inhibited IL-2-mediated IFN-y production .
In both types of donors , the effect of IL-13 on IL-2-induced IFN-y production was in marked contrast to the strong inhibition seen with IL-4 in NK cells .
Additionally , IL-13 suppresses IL-2-induced NK cytolytic and proliferative activities although less efficiently than IL-4 .
In T cells , IL-13 inhibits anti-CD3 mAb/IL-2- or PHA-mediated IFN-y production and enhances cytolytic potential .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that IL-13 , like IL-4 , induces distinct STAT6-DNA binding complexes and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 and Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) in NK and T cells .
We observed that Abs directed against unique domains of STAT6 have differential effects on complexes in T cells but not in NK cells , suggesting different STAT6 isoforms .
These findings show that IL-13 and IL-4 have the ability to regulate NK and T cell activation and that IL-13 is a potent regulator of STAT6 and JAK3 in these cell types .
- The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 161 ; 218-227. blood NK and T cells require several extracellular signaling proteins , including IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-12 , and IFNs ( 1-3 ) .
IL-13 is a 13-kDa protein derived from activated T cells and mast cells .
Its amino acid sequence is approximated 30 % identity to that of IL-4 , including two disulfide linkages ( 4-6 ) .
IL-13 , like IL-4 , has been found to have a critical role for modulating the biologic activity of human B lymphocytes and monocytes .
For example , IL-13 can enhance the expression of MHC II and CD23 in monocytes and B cells and induces Ig class switching to IgE in human B cells similar to that observed with IL-4 treatment ( 4-12 ) .
However , the biologic effects of IL-13 on primary NK and T cells have not been well defined .
In human NK cells , while it has been demonstrated that IL-13 , unlike IL-4 , increases IL-2-induced IFN-y production ( 4 , 5 ) and cytolytic activity ( 4 ) , the IL-13 signaling mechanism in these cells has not been investigated .
In human T cells , the biologic effects of IL-13 have not been fully defined although it has been demonstrated that IL-13 is incapable of promoting T cell proliferation ( 5 , 6 , 13 ) .
In addition , it also has been reported that T cells ( 5 , 13-15 ) , as well as NK and LAK cells ( 14 , 15 ) , lack a functional IL-13R .

Copyright © 1998 by The American Association of Immunologists In contrast , it also has been reported that IL-13 , like IL-4 , induces IL-4 responsive element DNA protein complexes in human T cells ( 16 ) and FoyRI GAS promoter DNA protein binding complexes in fresh human PBL ( 17 ) .
Nevertheless , this limited information suggests that the biologic effects of IL-13 might be distinct when NK and T cells are compared .
Therefore , we investigated the signaling and biologic effects of IL-13 on NK and T cells to define the possible different effects of IL-13 on these cell types and to determine whether these effects are distinct from those of IL-4 .
The molecular basis for cytokine functional redundancy is thought to occur through shared receptor chains or signaling molecules ( 18 ) .
According to binding assays and functional analysis , it has been demonstrated that IL-13 and IL-4 share common signaling molecule ( s ) ( 6 , 12 , 19-24 ) .
In T cells , IL-4Ra conjugates with the common y-chain ( cy ) ( 25 ) to form a high affinity IL-4R complex ( 26 , 27 ) .
Recently , human and murine IL-13Ra chains , responsible for binding IL-13 , were cloned and found capable of associating with the IL-4Ra to form a high affinity IL-13 receptor complex ( 28-30 ) .
Thus , these data suggest that IL-13 might share some biologic effects with IL-4 .
The Janus kinase ( JAK ) STAT pathway is an important cyto-kine-induced signal transduction pathway that directly transfers signals from cell surface cytokine receptors to the nucleus ( 31-33 ) .
In the case of IL-4 , IL-4Ra and cy are believed to be associated with JAK1 and JAK3 , respectively ( 27 , 34 ) .
The activation of JAKs leads to phosphorylation of IL-4Ra and recruitment and activation of STAT6 ( 21 , 35-40 ) .
STAT6 has been demonstrated to play a critical role in regulating the expression of MHC II , CD23 molecules , and production of IgE in B cells , as well as secretion of IL-4 and IFN-y in T cells in the STAT6-deficient mouse model ( 41-43 ) , suggesting that the activation of STAT 6 is a key event for IL-4-mediated biologic effects .
Therefore , we further investigated whether or not STAT6 and JAK3 were involved in the IL-13-induced signal transduction in NK and T cells .
0022-1767/98/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; The Journal of Immunology In this study , we demonstrate that IL-13 is able to differentially modulate specific biologic properties of NK and T cells , including IFN-y production , cytotoxic activity , and NK cell proliferation , and that these effects are distinctive from those mediated by IL-4 .
In addition , we found that IL-13 induces distinct activation of STAT6 when primary human NK and T cells are compared .
These findings indicate that IL-13 may play an important role in regulating the differentiation and activation of NK and T cells .

Purification of NK and T cells and cell stimulation PBMC were separated on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients by leukophoresis packages obtained from healthy donors through the National Institutes of Health blood bank as previously described ( 45 ) .
Leukocyte suspensions were washed in HBSS and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 1 % heat-inactivated FCS .
Adherent cells ( monocytes and B cells ) were removed by adherence to plastic dishes to nylon wool and via elutriation .
Highly enriched populations of CD3* CDS56~ T cells ( 95-99 % ) ( < 2 % LGL ; large granular lymphocytes ) and LGL ( > 90 % pure ) ( < 10 % CD3+* T cells , < 2 % monocytes ) were obtained from PBMC by centrifugation of nylon wool-passed and elutriated cells on discontinuous density gradients of percoll ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
The purity of T and NK cells was analyzed by flow cytometry .

For cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion assays , the cell cultures were treated with 100 U/ml of IL-2 , 1 ug of mAb against CD3/10® T cells , or 5 ug/ml of PHA .
For EMSA , freshly isolated human NK cells and T cells were immediately washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium to remove contaminating percoll .
Next , aliquoted cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium , incubated at 37°C for 30 min in the absence of FCS , and then immediately stimulated with various cytokines at times and concentrations described in the figure legends .
Preactivated T cells were obtained by treating freshly isolated T cells with 100 U/ml IL-2 for 72 h. For EMSA , before restimulation , cytokines were removed from the cell culture by washing , and rested in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 % FCS for 24 h at a concentration of 2 X 10° cells/ml .
Cytotoxicity assays and cytokine measurement Freshly isolated NK and T cells were cultured in the absence or presence of cytokines .
The cells harvested from the cultures were used for cytotoxic assays while their supernatants were collected for cytokine analysis .
In the cytotoxicity assay , target cells , K562 , which were derived from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis ( 47 ) , were labeled with 100 uCi of `` Cr ( New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) for 1 h at 37°C and washed .
Labeled target cells ( 5 X 10° ) and effector cells were cultured together in 200 gl of medium in microtiter plates ( Linbro , Hamden , CT ) at several effect-to-target ratios ( 25:1 , 12:1 , 6:1 , 3:1 ) .
After 4 h of incubation at 37°C , the supernatant was harvested and counted in a gamma scintillation counter .
Cytotoxicity was determined by the amount of **Cr released 219 from lysed target cells .
Three replicates were used per experimental group , and the percentage of specific lysis was calculated according to the for-mula : lysis = 100 X [ ( cpm in experimental wells ) - ( cpm in wells with target cells alone ) ] / ( { cpm incorporated in target cells ) .
IFN-y production was measured using IFN-y Elisa Kits ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) .
All samples were measured in duplicate and plotted against the standard curve and reported as pg/ml .
In all assays , the SD of cytokine measurement was less than 25 pg/ml .
Proliferation assay Freshly isolated human NK or T cells ( 2 X 10° ) were cultured in flat-bottom 96-well plates .
Each sample was tested in triplicate in 200:1 total volume .
After 2 to 3 days culture with or without cytokines , wells were pulsed with 1 Ci of methyl [ °HJthymidine ( [ °H ] JTdR ; DuPont NEN , Boston , MA ; 6.7 Ci/mmol , ICN Radiochemicals , Costa Mesa , CA ) and harvested 4 h later on a Skatron Cell Harvester ( Skatron , Sterling , VA ) .

Labeled DNA probe was further purified from a 12 % polyacrylamide gel by excising the corresponding radioactive band after electrophoresis .
The purified DNA probe was aliquoted at 15,000 epm per pl and stored at -20°C until use .
For supershift analysis , extracts were incubated with 1 pl antisera to STAT1a , STAT3 , STAT5a , STAT5b , and STAT6 , while 1 pg anti-STAT4 , and 1-2 pl normal rabbit serum were incubated with samples for 2 h on ice , before addition of *°P-labeled DNA probe .

The cells then were harvested for cytotoxicity assay ( denoted as LAK potential ) , and the supernatants were analyzed for IFN-y levels ( indicated as pg/ml ) .
From nine donors , Donor 1 and Donor 2 were selected as representatives for two distinct NK cell responses from five and four donors , respectively .
Lytic potential was calculated at E : T ratio of 25:1 .
Results IL-13 regulates IFN-y production in primary NK and T cells To examine whether IL-13 and IL-4 differentially regulate IFN-y production in primary NK and T cells , fresh primary NK cells were stimulated with medium , 10 , 100 , and 1,000 ng/ml of IL-13 , or 10 , 100 , and 1,000 ng/ml of IL-4 in the presence or absence of 50 U/ml of IL-2 for 18 h. Fresh primary T cells were cultured with 100 ng/ml of IL-4 or 100 ng/ml of IL-13 in presence or absence of anti-CD3 mAb ( 1 mg/10° cells ) /IL-2 ( 100 U/ml ) or PHA ( 5 pg/ml ) for 48 h. Supernatants from these cultures were harvested for the measurement of IFN-y by ELISA whereas the cells were collected for cytotoxicity assays ( discussed below ) .
In primary NK cells , IL-13 , but not IL-4 , could induce low levels of IFN-y secretion in both representative donors ( Table I , donors 1 and 2 ) .
When NK cells were costimulated with IL-13 and IL-2 , IL-13 generally resulted in two types of reactivity from nine donors tested .
Donor 1 is representatives of five of nine donors , in which IL-13 synergized with IL-2 to stimulate IFN-y production ( 3- to 27-fold increase ) ( Table I ) and is consistent with previous reports ( 4 , 5 ) .
However , donor 2 represents four of nine donors where IL-13 modestly inhibited IFN-y production ( about a twofold reduction ) ( Table I ) .
Currently , the reasons for variability in IFN-y production , probably resulting from the differences between NK cell populations in response to IL-13 stimulation , are unknown ( i.e .
, IL-13R or IL-2R expression , signaling molecules , and differentiation states ) .
Nevertheless , in both types of donors , the effect of IL-13 on IFN-y production was in marked contrast to the strong inhibition seen with IL-4 in NK cells ( Table I ) since 10 ng/ml of IL-4 was able to effectively inhibit IL-2-induced IFN-y production .
In primary T cells , IL-4 or IL-13 alone did not induce a detectable level of IFN-y production ( Table II ) .
However , different levels of IFN-y production were detected in the cultures in which T cells were stimulated with either anti-CD3 mAb/IL-2 or PHA ( Table II ) .
IL-13 inhibited both anti-CD3 mAb/IL-2- and PHA-mediated IFN-y production ( approximately 50 % reduction ) while IL-4 inhibited only PHA-induced IFN-y production .

The cytokince-treated cells were used in a cytotoxicity assay against K562 ( denoted as LAK potential ) , or measurements of CD25 or Class II ( HLA-Dr ) expression ( indicated % of cells ) , and IFN-y secretion ( denoted as pg/m ! )
.
inhibition might vary under certain T cell activation conditions .
However , these data suggest that NK and T cells might express a functional IL-13R , and IL-13 and IL-4 may have different roles in regulating IFN-y production in these cell types .
IL-13 regulates cytolytic activity in primary NK and T cells The NK and T cells from the above-mentioned cultures were utilized for cytotoxicity assays .
IL-13 itself induced low NK cytolytic activity , while IL-4 had no effect ( Table I , donors 1 and 2 ) .
In addition , IL-13 had a lower ( less than 50 % ) inhibitory effect on the IL-2-induced NK cytolytic activity ( Table I , donors 1 and 2 ) , which was different from the previous report that demonstrated that IL-13 could increase the IL-2-induced LAK activity ( 4 ) .
This difference is probably due to donor-to-donor variations or possibly different sources of IL-13 .
In contrast , as previously reported ( 53 ) , IL-4 strongly suppressed IL-2-mediated LAK potential ( > 90 % re-duction ) .
These data suggest that both IL-13 and IL-4 have an inhibitory effect on IL-2-induced NK cytolytic activity , but IL-4 is a more potent inhibitor , which is consistent with previous reports that IL-13 and IL-4 have different roles in the regulation of LAK activity ( 4 , 5 ) .
In T cells , IL-13 or IL-4 alone did not induce T cell cytolytic activity ( Table II ) .
If T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb/ IL-2 for 48 h , a low level of T cell cytolytic activity was detected .
However , when T cells were costimulated with anti-CD3 mAb/ IL-2 and either IL-13 or IL-4 , both IL-4 and IL-13 increased the cytolytic potential of T cells although IL-4 is much more potent ( Table II ) .
These results are consistent with the previous report that IL-4 augmented LAK activity with other T cell mitogens in the absence or presence of IL-2 ( 54 ) .
In contrast , in NK cells , IL-4 and IL-13 inhibited IL-2-mediated LAK activity ( Table I ) .
These data suggest that NK and T cells are responsive to IL-13 stimulation and that IL-13 , like IL-4 , can differentially regulate cytolytic activity in T and NK cells .
IL-13 inhibits IL-2-induced NK cell proliferation , but has no significant proliferative activity in primary T and NK cells Previous reports have demonstrated that IL-4 can inhibit IL-2-dependent proliferation of human NK and T cells ( 53 , 55 ) , but the effect of IL-13 on NK cell proliferation has not been determined .
Freshly isolated NK and T cells were cultured for 60 h in the absence or presence of 10 and 100 U/ml of IL-2 , 10 and 100 ng/ml of IL-13 , or 10 and 100/ml of IL-4 alone or in combinations of IL-2 with IL-13 or IL-4 as indicated in Figure 1 .

[ °H ] thymidine incorporation assays were performed in 2 X 10° primary NK cells ( Fig .

The cells were stimulated with medium , 10 and 100 U/ml IL-2 , 10 and 100 ng/ml IL-13 , 10 and 100 ng/ml IL-4 , respectively , and the combination of IL-2 with either IL-13 or IL-4 as indicated .

The data was repeated in three experiments in NK cells and in two experiments in T cells .
results of [ °H ] thymidine incorporation experiments showed that 10 or 100 U/ml of IL-2 significantly induced NK cell proliferation while 10 or 100 ng/ml of IL-13 or IL-4 did not ( Fig .

However , when IL-13 was combined with IL-2 , IL-13 inhibited IL-2-induced NK cell proliferation ( Fig .

In contrast , IL-4 itself or in combination with IL-2 , had a stimulatory ( or additive ) effect on primary T cell proliferation , consistent with the previous report that IL-4 stimulates T cell growth by an IL-2-independent mechanism ( 56 ) .
The inhibitory effects of IL-4 on IL-2-dependent proliferation of T cells occurred when T cells also were costimulated with anti-CD3 Ab ( 57 ) .
In addition , IL-13 or IL-4 alone did not induce the expression of CD25 and HLA-Dr molecules on the cell surface , while the stimulation of T cells with anti-CD3 mAb/IL-2 or PHA significantly induced CD25 and HLA-Dr expression ( Table II ) .
IL-13 , but not IL-4 , when used in combination with anti-CD3 mAb/IL-2 , increased the number of T cells expressing CD25 ( from 35 % to 50 % ) and HLA-Dr ( from 14 % to 24 % ) .
In addition , PHA is more effective than anti-CD3-Ab/IL-2 in the induction of CD25 and HLA-Dr expression in T cells , indicating that the PHA-stimulated T cells potentially express more high affinity IL-2R than anti-CD3 Ab/IL-2 stimulated ones , suggesting that IL-13 might expand the pool of IL-2 responding cells ( Table II ) .
IL-13 , like IL-4 , induces distinct Ce DNA-protein binding complexes in fresh primary human NK and T cells Transcription factor STAT6 is one of the key elements in the transduction of IL-4-mediated signaling ( 41-43 ) .
To determine whether NK and T cells were responsive to IL-13 stimulation resulting in STAT6 activation , nuclear extracts were prepared from fresh primary T and NK cells stimulated with IL-13 , IL-4 ( positive control ) , IL-6 , and IL-12 ( negative control ) for 15 min at 37°C .
Using a Ce STAT6 DNA-binding element as an oligonucleotide probe ( 42 , 50 ) , EMSA analysis revealed that IL-13 and IL-4 induced two similar Ce DNA-protein complexes in fresh primary NK cells , which were designated as complexes B and C , according to their electrophoretic mobility ( Fig .
24 , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
We also observed a slow migrating band ( designated as complex A ) induced by IL-13 and IL-4 in fresh primary T cells ( Zanes 8 and 9 ) that was not seen in NK cells .
In addition , the complex C appeared constitutively at low levels in primary T cells in some donors ( Fig .
2A , and data not shown ) .
In contrast , IL-6 and IL-12 did not induce any specific DNA protein complex with this oligonucleotide probe ( lanes 2 , 5 , 7 , and 10 ) .

complexes further suggests that primary human NK and T cells express functional IL-13R .
Second , IL-13 and IL-4 induce similar binding complexes in NK or T cells .
Third , distinct DNA-protein binding complexes are induced by IL-13 and IL-4 , when comparing both cell types .
It is well established that STAT proteins show preferential binding affinity to different DNA-recognition sequences ( 31 , 58 ) .
To explore the possibility that IL-13 and IL-4 induce distinct DNA-binding complexes when NK and T cells are compared , we analyzed these cells using a SIE GAS-like oligonucleotide probe that preferentially binds STAT1a , STAT3 , and STAT4 ( induced by IL-6 and IL-12 , respectively ) ( 49 , 52 , 59 , 60 ) .
IL-13 and IL-4 did not induce DNA-protein complex formation with its oligonucleotide probe ( Fig .
2B , lanes 3 , 4 , 7 , and 8 ) .
In contrast , IL-6 induced three SIE GAS DNA-protein-binding complexes with similar mobility ( Zanes 2 and 7 ) when comparing NK and T cells , while IL-12 induces two unique bands upon prolonged exposure ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that different GAS-like element DNA probes ( ie , Ce or SIE ) can selectively bind activated STAT proteins as evidenced by the unique binding patterns .
Moreover , these data also suggest that IL-13 and IL-4 might not significantly induce the activation of STAT1a « and STAT3 proteins in primary NK and T cells .
Dose and time-dependence of IL-13-induced Ce DNA-protein-binding complexes To further characterize IL-13 activation of STAT6 in NK and T cells , time-course and dose-dependence assays were performed .
Cells were stimulated with 1 , 10 , 100 , 500 , or 1,000 ng/ml of IL-13 for 15 min or with 100 ng/ml of IL-13 for 1 , 5 , 15 , 30 , and 90 min for EMSA assay , or with 100 ng/ml of IL-4 as a positive control ( Fig .
3 ) .
IL-13 ( 10 ng/m ! )
very weakly induced Ce DNA-protein-binding complexes while 100 ( 8 nM ) , 500 , and 1000 ng/ml of IL-13 induced two Ce DNA-protein-binding complexes ( designat- EFFECTS OF IL-13 ON NK AND T CELLS ed as complexes A and B ) ( Fig .
3 , lanes 4 , 5 , and 6 ) .
Peak induction of Ce DNA-protein-binding complexes was found to occur between 15 and 30 min ( Zanes 10 and 11 ) .
These results are similar to those observed with IL-4 induction of IL-4NAF-binding complexes ( 35 ) .
Lastly , 100 ng/ml of IL-4 induced the same complexes that were induced by IL-13 ( Fig .
3 , lane 7 ) .
IL-13-induced Ce DNA-protein complexes contain STAT6 protein ( s ) To identify the protein components in IL-13- and IL-4-induced Ce DNA-binding complexes , supershift analysis with STAT6-specific Abs was performed ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
Three anti-STAT6 antisera were tested , which recognize distinct STAT6 sites ( as described in Materials and Methods ) .
In the IL-13-treated nuclear extracts , Ab prepared against amino acids 827-847 ( designated STAT6h1 ) effectively blocked and supershifted both complexes A and B ( Fig .
4A , lane 3 ) .
The other Ab recognizing amino acids 787-804 ( designated STATh2 ) blocked and supershifted only complex A ( Fig .
4A , lane 5 ) .
In contrast , antisera against STAT3 and STATém ( lanes 2 and 4 ) had no effect on these DNA-protein complexes .
These results indicated that complexes A and B contain STAT6 protein ( s ) .
Whether Ab prepared against amino acids 787-804 is less efficient or incapable of recognizing possible STAT6 isoforms or other associated protein involvement is unknown .
Similar supershift results also were obtained in nuclear extracts prepared from IL-4-treated T cells ( Fig .
4B ) .
Complexes A and B induced by IL-4 contained STAT6 proteins , but not STAT3 and STAT4 ( Fig .
4B , lanes 2 , 3 , and 5 ) , or STATS5a and STAT5b ( data not shown ) .
Western STAT6 supershift results were obtained with NK cells ( data not shown ) .
These data demonstrated that IL-13 is able to directly activate STAT6 in fresh primary T and NK cells , analogous to IL-4 .
IL-13 induces different patterns of Ce DNA-protein-binding complexes in preactivated primary T cells vs fresh primary T cells The activation of primary T cells for several days by various stim-uli , such as IL-2 , anti-CD3 Ab , or PHA , leads to morphologic and functional cell changes .
To determine whether preactivated T cells , stimulated with PHA/IL-2 for 3 days ( described in Materials and Methods ) , are distinct from the freshly isolated primary T cells stimulated with IL-4 or IL-13 , STAT6 activation was measured by EMSA , and supershift analysis was performed ( Fig .
5 ) .
In both primary ( Zane 1-3 ) and preactivated T cells ( lanes 4-12 ) obtained from the same donor , IL-4 and IL-13 induced complex A and B in primary T cells ( Fig .
5 , lanes 2 and 3 ) ( see also Figs .
2 and 3 ) while significantly inducing three Ce DNA-protein-binding complexes ( designated as A , B , and C ) in the preactivated T cells ( Fig .
5 , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Similar results were observed in three other donors ( data not shown ) .
IL-2 did not induce any DNA-protein complex in this donor 's cells , but a single band , more slowly migrating than the bands induced by IL-13 or IL-4 , was seen with cells obtained from other donors ( data not shown ) .
The supershift analysis showed that both complex A and complex B were blocked with anti-STAT6h1 antiserum ( Fig .
5 , lane 7 ) while only complex A was blocked by anti-STAT6h2 antiserum for IL-13- and IL-4-treated cells ( data not shown ) .
This result is consistent with results described in Figure 4 .
However , complex C was neither blocked nor supershifted by anti-STAT1 a , -STAT3 , -STAT4 , or -STAT5 @ /b ( Fig .

To elucidate the identity of complex C , specific and nonspecific cold oligo competition assays within EMSA were performed .

6 ) .
Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting revealed that STAT6 was phosphorylated following IL-13 stimulation in NK cells ( lane 3 ) and T cells ( Zane 6 ) in a manner analogous to IL-4-treated cells ( Zanes 2 and 5 ) .
This blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT6 antiserum to verify equal amounts of loaded protein ( Fig .
6B ) .
A small fragment migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa also was recognized by the anti-STAT6 antiserum although it was not detected with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab ( Fig .
6B ) .
Whether this protein represents an isoform of STAT6 or a degraded product is currently being investigated .
In any case , these results demonstrate that IL-13 , as well as IL-4 , induce STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation in both cell types .
To determine whether IL-13 , like IL-4 , is able to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and JAK1 in primary T cells , the immunoprecipitation assays of JAK3 and JAK1 were performed with extracts from the preactivated primary T cells that have been stimulated with medium , 100 ng/m !
of IL-13 , and 100 ng/ml of IL-4 for 15 min respectively .
The results showed that IL-13 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 although the level of IL-13-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 was lower than induced by IL-4 ( Fig .
7 ) .
However , in comparison with JAK3 , IL-13 very weakly induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 ( data not shown ) .
However , these results suggest that IL-13 induced the activation of STAT6 , due to the activation of JAK3 .
Discussion In this report , we demonstrate that IL-13 and IL-4 differentially regulate specific functional activities of NK and T cells .
Moreover , we provide evidence that IL-13 , similar to IL-4 , induces the activation of STAT6 and JAK3 in fresh primary T and NK cells .
This conclusion is based on EMSA , supershift analysis , immunopre-cipitation , and Western blot analysis .
In addition , we found that IL-13 , as well as IL-4 , induced distinct and overlapping patterns of Ce DNA-protein-binding complexes when comparing primary NK cells and T cells .
These results suggest that STAT6 may be differentially utilized in a cell-dependent fashion and that IL-13 may play an important role in the regulation of NK and T cells .
We have observed that IL-13 , but not IL-4 , weakly induced IFN-y production in NK cells and either synergized with IL-2 or weakly inhibited ( with 30-50 % reduction ) IL-2-mediated IFN-y T Cells NK Cells T Cells F -- - O EFFECTS OF IL-13 ON NK AND T CELLS [ OI IL-4 - 0 400-0 o- # 0 IL-18 - - £0 - - + 4 Marker Marker - + kDa kDa -116 _ STATG- » > aas ame amp « e ase ame __ ~- 115 -or e -97 -66 -66 -as - too # Cl C oan ae w aHe = - : production .
This result likely reflects the variability in NK cells seen from donor to donor .
However , in both situations , the IL-13 effect was in marked contrast to the strong inhibition ( with more than 90 % reduction ) seen with IL-4 in NK cells ( Table I ) .
The different effects of IL-13 and IL-4 on IFN-y production in NK cells also were confirmed by analyzing the effects of IL-4 and IL-13 pretreatment for the first 24 h on IL-2-mediated IFN-y production ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that IL-13 and IL-4 might have a different role in regulating IFN-y production in NK cells .
However , in T cells , IL-13 and IL-4 similarly inhibit PHA-induced IFN-y secretion .
This is in contrast to the effect of IL-4 on NK cells where it acts as a strong inhibitor of IFN-y production .
Furthermore , in NK cells , IL-13 weakly and IL-4 strongly inhibit the IL-2-induced cytolytic activities whereas , in T cells , both IL-13 and IL-4 enhance CD3/IL-2-mediated LAK potential .
These data also suggest that T cells express functional IL-13R and IL-13 might share similar biologic effects with IL-4 in NK and T cells .
A previous report has demonstrated that IL-13 was able to increase IL-2-mediated LAK activity , while our data demonstrated IL-13 weakly inhibits this activity .

However , it is consistent with a previous report that IL-13 and IL-4 have a different role in the regulation of LAK activity .
Collectively , this evidence further elucidates that NK and T cells are functionally regulated by IL-13 and that its effects on NK and T cells are unique and overlapping compared with IL-4 .
Previous studies have suggested that the functional IL-13R are not expressed on T cells ( 5 , 13-15 ) , LAK ( 15 ) , and NK cells ( 14 ) .
However , IL-13 , like IL-4 , has been demonstrated to induce IL-4 responsive element DNA-protein complexes in primary human T cells ( 16 ) or FeyRI-binding DNA-protein complexes in fresh human PBL ( 17 ) .
Thus , a potential question arises as to whether or not the cells utilized in the experiments were contaminated by monocytes or B cells .
However , in the data presented in this manuscript , the primary NK and T cells did not contain a significant level of contaminating monocytes and B cells , based on fluorescent staining for phenotype determination .
In addition , we have observed different patterns of STAT6 activation between NK and T cells , which also could not be explained by the possibility of monocyte and B cell contamination in these cell preparations .
Moreover , IL-13 is able to modulate the NK and T cell biologic activities as described above .
Thus , our data provide evidence that IL-13 may regulate primary T cells and thereby substitute for IL-4 , perhaps explaining why impairment in Th2 development seen in STAT6 '~ mice is more pronounced than observed in IL-4-defi-cient mice ( 43 ) .
Therefore , in this manuscript , we have provided important observations that offer insight into the biology of IL-13 and on the expression and function of IL-13R on human T and NK cells .
Data from Table I would suggest that IL-13 is not a significant inducer of IFN-y production or LAK activity for NK cells , but perhaps acts as a co-regulatory agent when combined with IL-2 .
Indeed , many factors regarding NK cell responsiveness to IL-2 , such as levels and types of IL-2R expression , may all determine differential biologic outcomes following IL-13 stimulation .
In the same donor , what appears to be clear is that IL-13 or IL-4 can have different or opposing effects on IL-2-induced IFN-y production .
Whether these effects are due to differences in unique signal transduction pathways rather than being dependent on the levels of IL-2R expression alone is not readily apparent and requires future study .
It is known that the primary NK and T cells express different IL-2R complexes ( 61 ) .
Therefore , these differences may determine the type of IL-13 effect seen in NK cells .
In addition , the receptor components for IL-13R complex and its state of expression on NK and T cells is not clear .
On the other hand , IL-13 and IL-4 have overlapping and distinct biologic effects on both NK and T cells .
Here , we have demonstrated that IL-13 and IL-4 are similarly able to induce distinct Ce GAS DNA-protein-binding complexes between NK and T cells , but they only partially share similar biologic effects on IL-2-induced proliferation and LAK activity , but not IFN-y production in NK cells .
These data suggest that the differential effects of IL-13 on NK and T cells might result from cell-dependent signaling pathways , differentiation status , and unique cytokine-signaling pathways .
While the signaling pathway responsible for mediating IL-13 responses is not well established in NK and T cells , the IL-4Ra probably serves as the signaling transducing subunit responsible for activation of STAT6 , 4PS , and JAK1 , as previously demonstrated with genetic and molecular approaches ( 21 , 37-39 , 62 ) .
In NK and T cells , IL-13 induces the activation of STAT6 , probably via IL-4Ra , that is also consistent with the models where IL-4Ra is able to associate with the newly discovered IL-13Ra ( 28-30 ) .
However , it would be interesting to determine whether or not these IL-13Ra ( s ) are differentially distributed between NK and T cells in 225 the future study .
A role for IL-2Ry ( or cy ) in IL-13 signaling also has been suggested based upon IL-13-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 ( 21 ) and its association with IL-4Ra « ( 63 ) .
In this study , we have demonstrated that IL-13 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 in primary human T cells , although less effectively than IL-4 ( Fig .
7 ) , suggesting that common y might be one of the IL-13R components in T cells , probably in NK cells .
In contrast , we did not observe a detectable level of JAK1 tyrosine phosphorylation although all proteins are expressed in equivalent amounts ( data not shown ) .
These findings are in contrast to a previous report that showed IL-13 induced JAK 1 tyrosine phosphor-ylation , but not JAK3 , in human B cells ( 62 ) .
Thus , distinct patterns of IL-13 and IL-4 signaling may be observed within different cell types although they may share only the common signaling chain , IL-4Ra .
In support of this hypothesis , we demonstrate that IL-13 , as well as IL-4 , distinctively induces cell-specific patterns of Ce GAS DNA-protein-binding complexes between NK and T cells .
Previous studies have reported the existence of alternatively spliced forms of STAT proteins such as STAT1a and STAT18 ( 64 ) , STAT3 ( 65 ) and STATS ( 66 ) .
Since our results derived from anti-STAT6 supershift analysis suggest unique STAT6 DNA-protein complexes , we hypothesize that these distinct complexes may represent either homodimeric and homotetrimeric forms of STAT6 or different spliced isoforms of STAT6 protein ( s ) .
This hypothesis is consistent with the previous observation that the multiple of STAT6 mRNA species were found in spleen , thymus , and peripheral blood lymphocytes ( 36 , 67 ) .
Thereby , the activation of distinct splice variants of STAT6 also may explain a putative mechanism by which IL-13 and IL-4 can differentially signal in various type cells , such as NK and T cells in our study , with different biologic effects .
However , it is unclear why IL-13 and IL-4 induce similar STAT6 DNA-binding complexes in NK cells , but have distinctive effects on IFN-y production .
Nevertheless , our data suggest that other signal transduction pathway ( s ) induced by IL-13 or IL-4 also might be involved in regulating IFN-y production in this cell type .
In summary , we have demonstrated that IL-13 , like IL-4 , can directly and differentially induce STAT6 activation in freshly isolated primary human T and NK cells , providing new evidence that these cytokines may exert cell-dependent effects on primary lymphocyte populations .
In addition , we have established that IL-13 has a unique biologic effect on the modulation of IFN-y secretion , cytolytic potential , and proliferation of primary human NK and T cells .
Therefore , IL-13 may play an important role in the regulation of NK and T cell biologic activities .
