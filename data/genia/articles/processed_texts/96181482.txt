W. Hooper Foundation and Department of Microbiology and Immunology , University of California , San Francisco , CA 94143 Communicated by J. Michael Bishop , University of California , San Francisco , CA , December 8 , 1995 ( received for review October 3 , 1995 ) ABSTRACT Activation of macrophages by bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces transcription of genes that encode for proinflammatory regulators of the immune response .
Previous work has suggested that activation of the transcription factor activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) is one LPS-induced event that mediates this response .
Consistent with this notion , we found that LPS stimulated AP-l-mediated transcription of a transfected reporter gene in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 .
As AP-1 activity is regulated in part by activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , which phosphorylates and subsequently increases the transcriptional activity of c-Jun , we examined whether LPS treatment of macrophages resulted in activation of this kinase .
LPS treatment of RAW 264.7 cells , murine bone marrow-derived macrophages , and the human monocyte cell line THP-1 resulted in rapid activation of the p46 and p54 isoforms of JNK .
Treatment with wild-type and rough mutant forms of LPS and synthetic lipid A resulted in JNK activation , while pretreatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A inhibited this response .
Binding of LPS-LPS binding protein ( LBP ) complexes to CD14 , a surface receptor that mediates many LPS responses , was found to be crucial , as pretreatment of THP-1 cells with the monoclonal antibody 60b , which blocks this binding , inhibited JNK activation .
These results suggest that LPS activation of JNK in monocyte/macrophage cells is a CD14- and protein tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent event that may mediate the early activation of AP-1 in regulating LPS-triggered gene induction .
Upon exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , a conserved component of the Gram-negative bacterium 's outer membrane , macrophages release a large number of immunoregulatory molecules including tumor necrosis factor « , interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 , and arachidonic acid metabolites that recruit and activate other immune cells to help fight the bacterial infection ( 1 , 2 ) .
The mechanism by which LPS induces these events is only partly understood .
At physiological con-centrations , LPS binds to the serum protein LPS-binding protein ( LBP ) .
This complex then interacts with CD14 on macrophages or neutrophils ( 3 ) .
Although CD14 is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked protein that lacks an intracellular domain , LPS-LBP binding to CD14 results in rapid phosphorylation of various proteins on tyrosyl residues ( 3 ) .
Inhibitors of this protein tyrosine phosphorylation response abrogate cyto-kine secretion and generation of eicosinoids ( 3 ) , emphasizing the importance of this event in mediating the macrophage response to LPS .
Among the most prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in LPS-stimulated macrophages are three members of the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase family , a group of related serine/threonine protein kinases that participate in transmitting extracellular signals to the cell The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

2774 interior , including the nucleus ( 4 , 5 ) .
The LPS-activated MAP kinases include p42/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 ( ERK2 ) , p44/ERK1 , and p38 , the recently described mammalian homologue of HOG1 , a MAP kinase-like protein that is activated in response to osmotic stress in yeast ( 3 ) .
These MAP kinases may be important mediators of LPS action in macrophages .
LPS induces transcription of several genes encoding proinflammatory mediators .
A key issue is how LPS-triggered signaling events lead to these gene inductions .
One of the promoter elements that contributes to LPS induction of the tissue factor gene in THP-1 monocytes and of the IL-6 gene in PU-1.8 monocytes is a TPA-response element ( TRE ) ( 6 , 7 ) .
The transcription factors that bind to TRE sites are referred to as the activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) complex , which consists of both homodimers and heterodimers of members of the Jun family ( c-Jun , JunB , and JunD ) and heterodimers of members of the Jun and Fos ( c-Fos , FosB , Fral , and Fra2 ) families .
Regulation of AP-1 occurs by induced transcription of c-jun and c-fos , or by posttranslational modification of their products ( 5 ) .
c-Jun is constitutively present in cells in an inactive form that can be activated by receptors inducing phosphorylation of two serine residues ( serines 63 and 73 ) within the transactivation domain of c-Jun ( 5 ) .
Phosphorylation of serines 63 and 73 appears to be mediated by either of two highly related c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases [ the p46 and p54 isoforms of c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) ] , which are members of the MAP kinase family ( 5 ) .
In this report , we show that physiological concentrations of LPS activate both isoforms of JNK in monocyte/macrophage cells in a CD14- and protein tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner .

Plasmids and Expression of Glutathione S-Transferase ( GST ) Fusion Proteins .
A plasmid encoding the GST-c-Jun fusion protein , pGEX3X-cJun ( 1-79 ) , was constructed by inserting a fragment encoding amino acids 1-79 from pBS-human c-Jun ( generously provided by B. M. Peterlin , University of California , San Francisco ) between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the GST-expressing vector pGEX3X ( Pharma-cia ) .
The 1-79 amino acid fragment of c-Jun had been amplified by the polymerase chain reaction , using primers that incorporated BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5 and 3 ' ends of the fragment , respectively .
The GST fusion protein expression vector was transformed into the DH-5 « strain of £ .

Protein induction and purification were as described ( 9 , 10 ) .
Cell Culture , Stimulation , and Cell Lysis .
The macrophage cell lines RAW 264.7 and THP-1 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained as described ( 11 , 12 ) .
From 48 to 72 hr prior to an experiment , the THP-1 cells were seeded into a culture flask at ~2.5 X 10° cells per ml in medium supplemented with 80 nM 1 @ ,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( vitamin D ; ) to induce CD14 expression ( 12 ) .
Transfected RAW 264.7 cells expressing a truncated , oncogenic form of human p74®* `` fused to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor ( ARaf-1 : ER ) were maintained in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with G418 ( 1.5 mg/ml ) ( 11 ) .
Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated and cultured in medium containing 20 % L-cell-conditioned medium as described ( 13 , 14 ) .
After at least 6 days in vitro , the murine bone marrow cells were seeded onto 100-mm plates and grown to 60-80 % confluency for experiments .
Examination of cellular responses and lysis conditions were as described ( 11 , 12 ) .
Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay .
Triton X-100-soluble protein lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) and then incubated with anti-JNK antibody overnight at 4°C .
The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase assay buffer ( 25 mM Hepes , pH 7.4/20 mM MgCl ; /20 mM B-glyc-erophosphate/0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate/2 mM dithio-threitol ) .
Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed as described ( 15 ) with the exception that reactions were performed at 30°C for 15 min using 15-25 ug of GST or GST-c-Jun substrate .
In-Gel Kinase Assay .
The kinase activity of JNK was also assessed by an in-gel kinase assay , wherein GST-c-Jun , the JNK substrate , was copolymerized into the polyacrylamide gel as described ( 16 ) .

USA 93 ( 1996 ) 2775 RESULTS LPS Stimulates AP-1 Transactivation in RAW 264.7 Macrophages .
The promoters of the tissue factor and IL-6 genes contain binding sites for the AP-1 transcription factor complex , and these sites are necessary for full LPS responsiveness ( 6 , 7 ) .
Moreover , LPS promotes AP-1 DNA binding activity ( 19-21 ) .
However , LPS stimulation of AP-1 transactivation has not yet been demonstrated .
We examined this issue by using an AP-1-driven luciferase reporter plasmid transiently transfected into RAW 264.7 cells .
LPS stimulated AP-1 transactivation , as indicated by an increase in luciferase activity , that was detected following 1 h of LPS treatment and was maximal by 2.5-3 h of stimulation ( Fig .
1 ; data not shown ) .
PMA also stimulated AP-1 transactivation , although the response lagged behind that with LPS .
Thus , LPS induces rapid AP-1 transactivation , which is consistent with this transcription factor complex participating in the induction of LPS-inducible genes .
Activation of JNK Occurs in Response to LPS Stimulation of Macrophages .
The ability of LPS to rapidly increase AP-1 transactivation suggested that it might be able to activate preexisting c-Jun in these cells via the JNK pathway .
To test whether LPS stimulation of macrophages resulted in activation of JNK , the p46 and p54 isoforms of JNK were immunoprecipitated from protein lysates of unstimulated as well as LPS-and PMA-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells .
The activity of the immunoprecipitated JNK was assessed using GST-c-Jun as a substrate .
LPS stimulation resulted in increased phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun by JNK , but not of GST , demonstrating the specificity of the assay for c-Jun sequences ( Fig .
2 ) .
Anti-JNK immunoprecipitates from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells catalyzed phosphorylation of myelin basic protein but to a much lesser extent than anti-ERK2 immunoprecipitates ( data not shown ) .
Anti-ERK2 immunoprecipitates did not phosphorylate the GST-c-Jun substrate ( data not shown ) , and LPS-induced phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun was likely not due to activated p38 MAP kinase as purified p38 does not phosphorylate this substrate ( 22 ) .
Finally , we previously demonstrated that activation of a fusion protein between oncogenic Raf-1 and the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor , ARaf-1 : ER , expressed in RAW 264.7 cells was sufficient to activate ERK1 and ERK2 ( 11 ) ; however , it did not activate JNK ( Fig .

2 ; data not shown ) .
These data demonstrate that activation of Raf-1 or the ERK pathway is not sufficient to activate JNK in macrophages .
Activation of JNK in response to LPS was rapid , occurring by 5 min of stimulation , reached a maximum by 20 min , and declined thereafter ( Fig .
34 ) .
This induced activity was detectable at 100 pg/ml and was maximal at 1 ug/ml !
( Fig .
3B ) .
LPS-induced JNK activation also occurred in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and in the human monocyte cell line THP-1 ( Fig .
4 ) , suggesting that this is a generalized response in macrophage cells .
The kinetics and dose-response that characterized JNK activation in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were similar to those found in the RAW 264.7 cells ( Fig .
5 ; data not shown ) .
Stimulus Specificity of JNK Activation .
Wild-type LPS consists of two structural domains : a carbohydrate O-region , which is variable among different bacteria , and a conserved lipid region , lipid A .
The predominant biological activity of the LPS molecule is contained in the lipid A domain , although the variable O-antigen structures may be the major target for the host 's anti-LPS immune response ( 3 ) .

Activation of JNK in different macrophage populations by different forms of LPS .
RAW 264.7 cells , murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages ( BM ) , and vitamin THP-1 cells were incubated ( in separate experiments ) in the presence of S. minnesota R595 LPS , synthetic lipid A ( LA ) , lipid IVa , or S. minnesota smooth LPS ( WT ) for 15 min ( all [ LPS ] 1 ug/ml ) .
JNK activity was determined as in Fig .

Stimulation with rough LPS from Salmonella minnesota R595 , which lacks most of the O-region carbohydrate domain , wild-type smooth LPS from both S. minnesota and E. coli ( K235 , 055 : B5 , and 0111 : B4 ) , synthetic lipid A , or lipid IVa , which is a biosynthetic precursor of LPS , induced activation of JNK in the RAW 264.7 cells ( Fig .
4 ; data not shown ) .
Similarly , R595 LPS , wild-type LPS , and lipid IVa induced JNK activation in the murine bone marrow-derived macrophages ( Fig .
4 ) .
These results indicated that JNK activation by LPS is generalizable to various forms of LPS and that the lipid A moiety is sufficient to induce this signaling event .
LPS Activates Both Isoforms of JNK .
Two isoforms of JNK , p46 and p54 , have been identified ( 24 ) .
To determine whether the LPS-induced phosphorylation of GST~-c-Jun by anti-JNK immunoprecipitates was due to p46 ' N® or or both , the anti-JNK immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in-gel kinase assay , wherein proteins were resolved on an SDS/ polyacrylamide gel containing GST-c-Jun and then renatured and allowed to phosphorylate the substrate in situ ( 16 ) .
As shown in Fig .
6 , LPS induced strong activation of both JNK isoforms with a similar time course to that noted in the immune complex kinase assays .
Anti-JNK immunoprecipitates from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells resolved on an SDS/ polyacrylamide gel containing GST alone or anti-ERK2 immunoprecipitates from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells resolved on a GST-c-Jun-containing SDS/polyacrylamide gel did not phosphorylate the gel substrate ( data not shown ) , indicating that phosphorylation of the substrate required c-Jun sequences and was specific for activated JNK .

p46 and p54 indicate the activated isoforms of JNK .
Effects of Herbimycin A on LPS-Induced JNK Activation .
Inhibitors of LPS-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation , such as herbimycin A , block the secretion of cytokines and the generation of eicosanoids ( 3 ) .
To test whether JNK activation is upstream or downstream of tyrosine kinase action following LPS stimulation , RAW 264.7 cells were incubated for 4 h with herbimycin A before being stimulated with LPS or PMA .
JNK activation by LPS was completely inhibited by herbimycin A ( 10 ug/ml ) ( Fig .
7 ) .
As previously reported ( 23 , 25 ) , this dose of herbimycin A did not inhibit the activation of ERK2 by PMA ( data not shown ) , indicating that the inhibition of herbimycin A was specific for protein tyrosine phosphorylation events and not due to general cellular toxicity .
Activation of JNK by LPS Is CD14 Dependent .
The glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked surface protein CD14 is expressed primarily on monocyte/macrophage cells and neutrophils and has been shown to mediate many of the responses of these cells to LPS ( 3 ) .
Moreover , antibodies directed against CD14 inhibit LPS induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and secretion of various cytokines ( 3 ) .
We therefore tested whether the ability of LPS to activate JNK in monocyte/macrophage cells was also mediated by CD14 .
The human monocytic THP-1 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of the anti-CD14 mAb 60b ( IgG1 ) , which prevents LPS-LBP complexes from binding to CD14 ( 26 ) and inhibits LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells ( 12 ) .
Cells were then stimulated with LPS at various doses , after which JNK activation was assessed by the immune complex kinase assay .
Inhibition of JNK activation was complete when the cells were incubated with at least 5 ug of anti-CD14 antibody per ml prior to LPS stimulation ( Fig .
5 ; data not shown ) .
Moreover , pretreatment of the THP-1 cells with 60b mAb at 5 and 10 ug/ml !
inhibited JNK activation at all doses of LPS tested ( Fig .
5 ; data not shown ) .
Pretreatment of these cells with other anti-CD14 mAbs blocked ERK2 phosphorylation only at low concentrations of LPS treatment ( < 10 ng/ml ) , whereas the 60b antibody blocked at low as well as high concentrations of LPS treatment { ref .
12 ; data not shown ) .
These observations likely reflect different properties of these anti-CD14 blocking antibodies .

DISCUSSION LPS stimulation of macrophages results in a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of p42/p44 ERK and p38/HOG1 MAP kinase pathways ( 3 ) .
Recently , a third mammalian MAP kinase-like pathway has been identified involving JNK , also known as the stress-activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) .
Activation of this pathway results in phosphorylation of the N-terminus of c-Jun and subsequent increase in its ability to activate transcription ( 5 ) .
LPS stimulation results in activation of the tissue factor and IL-6 genes in an AP-1-dependent manner ( 6 , 7 ) and , as shown in this report , LPS rapidly stimulates AP-1 transactivation .
Therefore , we wished to examine whether JNK was also activated in response to LPS in macrophages .
We have found that LPS stimulates activation of JNK in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells in a rapid and dramatic fashion .
The activation of JNK was apparent after 5 min of LPS stimulation , and was maximal by 20 min .
Moreover , JNK activation appeared to be a general feature of the LPS response of macrophages as LPS also stimulated JNK activation in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and in human THP-1 monocytes .
Recently , LPS has also been reported to activate JNK in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human CD14 ( 22 ) , indicating that this signaling event may occur in other LPS-responsive cell types as well .
Treatment with wild-type LPS , a rough mutant form of LPS , and the biologically active moiety of LPS , lipid A activated this kinase in the macrophage cells tested .
This response was CD14 dependent , as pretreatment of THP-1 cells with a mAb against CD14 abrogated the response .
Additionally , activation of JNK was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A , indicating that this event , as with many early LPS-induced events , is dependent on intact tyrosine phosphorylation .
We can not rule out that herbimycin A directly inhibits JNK , but this seems unlikely as JNK is a serine/threonine kinase and herbimycin A does not directly inhibit p42/p44 ERK activation .
We presume that the tyrosine phosphorylation requirement reflects an important role for one or more tyrosine kinases in LPS-induced activation of the related MAP kinase pathways .
One interesting feature of these studies was that JNK was not activated in response to stimulation of macrophages by the phorbol ester PMA , in contrast to what has been seen in a number of other cell types ( 15 , 16 ) .
JNK activity was also not increased upon activation of ARaf-1 : ER in RAW 264.7 transfectants expressing this chimeric protein .
PMA treatment and ARaf-1 : ER activation do , however , result in rapid and near-complete activation of ERK1 and ERK2 ( 11 , 23 ) .
Therefore , activation of Raf-1 or the ERK pathway are not sufficient to activate JNK in macrophages .
In contrast , PMA treatment did result in increased AP-1-mediated transactivation , although it was slower than that seen upon LPS treatment .
Thus , it may be that AP-1 activity could be increased in two ways , one of which was independent of JNK activation .
As PMA stimulation resulted in accumulation of c-fos mRNA in the RAW 264.7 cells ( data not shown ) , perhaps activation of the ERK pathway increased AP-1 activity by inducing expression of c-fos , whose protein product could then bind to preexisting c-Jun ( 5 ) .
This hypothesis is consistent with the slower activation of AP-1 seen by PMA treatment compared to that induced by LPS .
LPS induces expression of c-fos ( ref .
27 ; data not shown ) but in addition activates JNK , and this could lead to the more rapid AP-1 activity .
2778 Immunology : Hambleton et al .
Activation of the three distinct MAP kinase subfamilies ( ERK , JNK , and p38 ) involves dual phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues separated by a single residue in the catalytic domain of these enzymes ( 4 ) .
In each of these three known subfamilies , there is a distinct amino acid between the phosphorylated threonine and tyrosine residues , and this likely provides target specificity for distinct activators of each subfamily ( 4 ) .
Reports to date indicate that Raf-1 and MEK1 activate the ERK cascade , MEKK-1 and MKK4 activates the JNK/SAPK cascade , and MKK3 activates p38 ( 5 , 28 ) .
Thus , in principle , different stimuli can activate one or more of the known MAP kinase family pathways .
Numerous mitogens and differentiative stimuli activate the ERK cascade ( 29 ) , whereas it is primarily proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stress that result in p38 activation ( 22 ) .
The JNK pathway is also activated by cytokines and cellular stress ( 5 ) , as well as by costimulation of T lymphocytes ( 30 ) , and activation of small GTPases ( 31 ) .
Interestingly , LPS strongly stimulates all three of these MAP kinase-like pathways in macrophages and is the only cellular stimulant characterized to date that does this .
The mechanisms by which LPS activates these pathways is not yet established .
Upon activation , members of the ERK and JNK subfamilies have been shown to translocate to the nucleus ( 5 ) , whereby phosphorylation of transcription factors may occur .
Activated ERK phosphorylates the ternary complex factor ( TCF ) , Elk-1/p62 `` C `` , which mediates c-fos induction via modulation of the serum response element ( 5 ) .
Activated ERK also phosphorylates NF-IL6 , which mediates induction of various genes , such as IL-6 and IL-8 ( 32-35 ) .
Activation of JNK , on the other hand , results in phosphorylation of the transcription factors c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2 ( ATF2 ) ( 36 ) , which , in turn , mediate regulation of the AP-1 complex and c-jun promoter ( 5 ) .
While it appears that these pathways are distinct signaling cascades , they may also converge on particular targets , such as the transcription factors Elk-1 ( 37 ) and c-Jun ( 38 ) .
Thus , simultaneous activation of the three MAP kinase pathways in LPS-stimulated macrophages is an important mechanism by which LPS-induced signaling events culminate in transcription of a number of immunoregulatory genes that then coordinate the host 's immune response .
Note Added in Proof .
A number of recent reports indicate that TNF-a and IL-1 probably activate all three of the MAP kinase pathways , as does LPS stimulation of monocyte/macrophage cells .
