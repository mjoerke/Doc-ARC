AM5S80 , a Stable Benzoic Derivative of Retinoic Acid , Has Powerful and Selective Cyto-Differentiating Effects on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Cells By Maurizio Gianni , Marco Li Calzi , Mineko Terao , Giovanna Guiso , Silvio Caccia , Tiziano Barbui , Alessandro Rambaldi , and Enrico Garattini All-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is successfully used in the cyto-differentiating treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) .
Paradoxically , APL cells express PML-RAR , an aberrant form of the retinoic acid receptor type a ( RARa ) derived from the leukemia-specific t ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal translocation .
We show here that AM580 , a stable retinobenzoic derivative originally synthesized as a RARa agonist , is a powerful inducer of granulocytic maturation in NB4 , an APL-derived cell line , and in freshly isolated APL blasts .
After treatment of APL cells with AM580 either alone or in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , the compound induces granulocytic maturation , as assessed by determination of the levels of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase , CD11b , CD33 , and G-CSF receptor mRNA , at concentrations that are 10- to 100-fold lower than those of ATRA necessary to produce similar effects .
By contrast , AM5S80 is not so effective as ATRA in modulating the expression of these differentiation markers in the HL-60 cell line and in freshly isolated HE CYTO-DIFFERENTIATING agent all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is successfully used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ; M3 in the French-American-British [ FAB ] classification ) .. `` In this type of dis-ease , ATRA circumvents the differentiation block of the leukemic blasts , causing them to mature from the promyelo-cyte stage along the granulocytic pathway . ``
The exquisite sensitivity of APL blasts to the cyto-differentiating action of ATRA is paradoxical .
In fact , as a consequence of the typical t ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal translocation , APL cells express PML-RAR , a functionally altered form of the nuclear retinoic acid receptor known as RARa.5° ATRA-dependent granulocytic differentiation is reproducible on cultures of From the Molecular Biology Unit , Centro Catullo e Daniela Bor-gomainerio and the Laboratory of Drug Metabolism , Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche `` Mario Negri `` , Milano ; the Division of Hematology , Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo , Largo Barozzi , Bergamo ; and the Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche `` Mario Negri `` sede di Bergamo , Bergamo , Italy .

In NB4 cells , two other synthetic nonselective RAR ligands are capable of inducing LAP as much as AMS580 , whereas or RARy-specific ligands are totally ineffective .
These results show that AM580 is more powerful than ATRA in modulating the expression of differentiation antigens only in cells in which PML-RAR is present .
Binding experiments , using COS-7 cells transiently transfected with PML-RAR and the normal RARa , show that AM580 has a lower affinity than ATRA for both receptors .
However , in the presence of PML-RAR , the synthetic retinoid is a much better transactivator of retinoic acid-responsive element-con-taining promoters than the natural retinoid , whereas , in the presence of RARa , AMS8O0 and ATRA have similar activity .
This may explain the strong cyto-differentiating potential of AM58O0 in PML-RAR-containing leukemic cells .

freshly isolated APL blasts as well as on cultures of the APL-derived NB4 `` and HL-60 `` cell lines .
In basal conditions , APL cells express PML-RAR , RARa , and the retinoic acid related receptors known as RXRs , `` whereas expression of RAR and RARy is not observed . ``
ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation leads to the appearance of mRNAs . ``
Because ATRA does not show any selectivity for the RAR subtypes `` and it can interact with RXRs via isomerization to 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9-cis RA ) , it is entirely possible that activation of any one of these receptors may underlie the differentiation process .
ATRA-dependent maturation of APL cells is incomplete and can be enhanced by the addition of other cyto-differentiating agents , such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) `` and cell-permeable cAMP analogs .
'* `` ' With respect to this , we recently showed that leukocyte alkaline phosphatase ( LAP ) , a specific and restrictive marker for the postmi-totic granulocyte , `` is not expressed at significant levels in APL blasts on treatment with ATRA alone .
However , incubation of the leukemic cells with combinations between the retinoid and the two other cyto-differentiating agents leads to a dramatic induction of the enzyme . '
'' ** ' In an attempt to define whether stimulation of specific RAR isoforms results in granulocytic maturation of APL cells , we evaluated the effects of a series of compounds with different specificities for RARs on the expression of LAP and other myeloid maturation markers , in the absence or presence of G-CSF .
In this report , we show that AM580 , a retinobenzoic derivative originally developed as a RARa-specific agonist , has a selective cyto-differentiating activity on PML-RAR-containing APL blasts .
In this leukemic cell type , the compound is much more potent than ATRA in inducing granulocytic differentiation .
This selective action is correlated with the ability of AMS80 to transactivate reti-noic-acid-responsive-element ( RARE ) -containing genes in the presence of PML-RAR much better than in the presence of RARa .

CYTO-DIFFERENTIATING EFFECTS OF AM580 ON APL MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture conditions and reagents .
| The NB4 APL cell line `` was a kind gift of Dr Michel Lanotte ( Unité INSERM 301 , `` Ge-netique cellulaire et moleculaire des leucemies `` `` ) .
HL-60 leukemic cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ; Rockville , MD ) .
Cells were routinely seeded at 4 X 10° mL in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ; GIBCO-BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
Cultures were free from mycoplasma as assessed using the Hoechst 33258 fluorescent dye system ( Farbwerke Hoechst AG , Frankfurt , Germany ) .
ATRA and 8-bromo-cAMP ( 8-Br-cAMP ) were purchased from Sigma ( St Louis , MO ) .
The compounds 4- ( 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethy1-2-naphtamido ) benzoic acid ( AMS80 ) and 4- ( 5,6,7.8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetra-methyl-2-anthracenyl ) benzoic acid ( CD367 ) were obtained from CIRD-Galderma ( Valbonne , France ) .
Ethyl p- [ ( E ) -2- ( 5,6,7,8-tet-rahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethy1-2-naphtyl ) -1-p - ropenyl ] -benzoic - acid ( TTNPB ) and 9-cis RA ) were obtained from Hoffmann-LaRoche ( Nutley , NJ ) .
Stock solutions of the various retinoids ( 10~ mol/L ) were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide under dimmed light and stored at -80°C and protected from light until use .
Recombinant human G-CSF ( specific activity , 10° U/mg protein ) was from Amgen Inc ( Thousand Oaks , CA ) .
Preparation of freshly isolated APL and chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) cells .
- Peripheral blood leukocytes from 5 CML patients during the stable phase of the disease were purified to 90 % homogeneity from buffy coats by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and sedimentation on dextran , as described elsewhere . ``
'' Almost pure preparations of APL cells were obtained by dextran sedimentation of bone marrow aspirates from 4 patients with a classical form of APL ( M3 according to the FAB classification ) presenting the typical t ( 15-17 ) chromosomal translocation .
These cell preparations consisted of more than 90 % APL blasts as assessed by morphol-ogy .
Leukemic cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS and cultured in this medium in the various experimental conditions described in the report .
Analysis of cell surface markers .
- NB4 , HL-60 , or APL cells were seeded at a concentration of 4 x 10°/mL in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS and incubated for 4 days in the presence of medium alone or medium containing retinoids and/or G-CSF .
The number of CD11b* and CD33* cells and the mean associated fluorescence were quantitated using a FACScan analyzer ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
Determination of surface markers was performed by a direct immunofluorescence assay using the following fluorescence conjugated monoclonal antibodies purchased from Becton Dickinson : phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated Leu15 ( IgG2a ; anti-CD11b ) and Leu M9 ( IgG1 ; anti-CD33 ) .
Simultest Control ( PE conjugates 1gG1 and IgG2a ; Becton Dickinson ) was used as a negative control .
`` * Measurement of LAP activity .
- Approximately 1 x 10° NB4 , HL-60 , and APL fresh leukemic cells or CML neutrophils were har-vested , pelletted by centrifugation at 400g for 10 minutes , washed once with 0.9 % NaCl , and centrifuged again .
The washed cell pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer ( 1 mmol/L MgCl , , 1 mmol/L CaC1 ; , 20 mmol/L ZnCl ; , 0.1 mol/L NaCl , 0.1 % [ vol/vol ] Triton X-100 , 50 mmol/L Tris/HCl , pH 7.4 ) and disrupted by vigorous pipetting .
The homogenate was used for the LAP assay , which was performed with p-nitrophenol phosphate ( Sigma ) as substrate according to the instructions of the manufacturer .
LAP activity was normalized for the content of protein in the sample .
Proteins were measured according to the Bradford method `` `` using BSA fraction V ( Sigma ) as a standard .
One unit of LAP activity is defined as the amount of enzyme capable of transforming 1 nmol of substrate in 1 minute at 25°C .
Enzyme assays were performed in conditions of linearity relative to the substrate and to the concentration of proteins .
1521 Northern blot analysis .
Total RNA was prepared from NB4 , HL-60 , and freshly isolated APL cells according to a modification of the guanidium isothiocyanate/CsCl method and used for Northern blot analysis . ``
'' The probes used for Northern blot analysis were a full-length human liver/bone/kidney-type ( L/B/K-type ) alkaline phosphatase cDNA ( ATCC ) , `` the cDNA coding for the G-CSF receptor , `` and the cDNA coding for the human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GGPDH ) . ``
The various probes were labeled to a specific radioactivity of 1 to 2 x 10° cpm/ug by using hexanucleotide primers and [ °°P ] dCTP . ``
Transactivation experiments .
| Simian COS-7 fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC and routinely passaged in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % FCS .
Transient transfection experiments were performed according to a standard calcium-phosphate coprecipitation procedure `` using the following plasmids : pSGS5-RARa® ( from Dr P.G .
Pelicci , Perugia , Italy ) and pSGS-PML/ RARa® containing the human RARa and PML-RAR cDNAs , respectively , under the control of the SV-40 early T-antigen promoter enhancer ; TRE-TK-CAT , containing the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene under the control of a palindromic synthetic RARE placed in front of the viral thymidine kinase gene `` ; pSVALBK ( de-nominated LAP CAT in this report ) , containing approximately 4.5 kb of the 5 flanking region of the upstream exon of the L/BK-type alkaline phosphatase gene placed in front of the CAT reporter ( from Dr T. Kadesch , Philadelphia , PA ) ; and pnIsLACZ containing the bacterial gene under the control of the early T-antigen of the SV40 enhancer-promoter* ( from Dr A. Weisz , Napoli , Italy ) .
Briefly , 50 ng each of RARa or PML-RAR and RXRa were cotransfected with 1 ug of the reporter gene ( TRE-TK CAT or LAP CAT ) , 0.5 ug of pnlsLACZ , and pBluscript to 10 pg .
After leaving the DNA coprecipitate in contact with cells for 16 hours , fresh medium ( 10 % charcoal stripped fetal calf serum to eliminate endoge-nous retinoids ) alone or fresh medium containing ATRA or AM580 was added and cells were further incubated for 36 hours .
At the end of the treatment , cells were harvested and processed for determination of CAT and 3-galactosidase activity .
CAT and -galactosidase activities were measured on cell extracts according to standard proce-dures `` and as described , `` respectively .
The results are expressed as relative CAT activity , which is the ratio of CAT activity produced by the reporter in cpm of acetylated chloramphenicol divided by the B-galactosidase activity produced by pnIsLACZ expressed in absorbance units at 420 nm .
Preparation of nuclear extracts and binding experiments .
| Nuclear extracts from RARa , PML-RAR , and mock transfected COS-7 cells were prepared as described by Nervi et al . ``
Briefly , the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 mL PTG ( 5 mmol/L sodium phosphate , pH 7.4 , 10 mmol/L thioglycerol , 10 % glycerol , aprotinin [ 0.15 umol/ LJ , leupeptin [ 2 mmol/L ] , and phenyImethylsulfonylfluoride [ 0.1 mmol/L ] ; Boheringer ) and homogenized with a Dounce homoge-nizer .
The pellet , containing the cell nuclei , was washed twice with 2 mL of PTG buffer .
The nuclear pellet was extracted in 10 mL of a buffer containing 10 mmol/L Tris-HCI , pH 8.5 , 2 mmol/L dithiothreitol , 10 % glycerol , 0.8 mol/L KCI , and the same protease inhibitors as above ; incubated for 1 hour in ice ; and then centrifuged at 130,000g for 30 minutes .
The resulting supernatant is referred to as the nuclear extract .
Nuclear extracts were used either immediately or after storage at -80°C .
In routine binding assays , nuclear extracts ( 200 to 400 LL ) were incubated with 1 nmol/L [ °H ] JCD367 ( CIRD-Galderma ; specific activity , 52.8 Ci/mmol ) in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of CD367 , AMS580 , or ATRA as cold competitors .
The preparations were incubated for 18 hours at 4°C and directly loaded on a Superose 6HR 10/30 ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) .

Fractions ( 0.4 mL each ) were collected and the radioactivity in each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting after the addition of 5 mL Filtercount ( Packard , Meriden , CT ) .
Although most of the saturation or competition binding assays were performed with this methodology , we also performed experiments with a faster technique that gives similar results and allows the simultaneous handling of a large number of samples . ``
Briefly , nuclear extracts were loaded over PD10 desalting columns ( Pharmacia ) previously washed consecutively with 15 mL phosphate-buffered saline and 10 mL PTG buffer containing 0.4 mol/L KCI and eluted with the same buffer at room temperature .
The first 2 mL .
of the eluted buffer were discarded , and the following 2.5 mL was collected and the radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation counting as above .
Linear least square analysis of the scatchard plot was performed with the aid of the computer program BDATA-EMF ( Vanderbilt Medical Center , Nashville , TN ) . ``
The retinoid concentrations that inhibit 50 % of the total specific CD367 binding were calculated using the nonlinear least squares regression analysis program ALLFIT ( Vanderbilt Medical Center ) . ``
Determination of intracellular levels of AM3580 and ATRA in NB4 and HL-60 cells .
ATRA and AMS80 were extracted from NB4 and HL-60 cells with acetonitrile , after adding the internal standard and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection as described . ``
Drug-free cells and cells containing known amounts of ATRA or AMS80 were analyzed concurrently with each set of samples .
Standard calibration curves were constructed by linear least squares regression analysis of the plot of the peak-height ratios between the compounds and the internal standard versus their concentrations in biologic samples .
The limit of detec-tion , precision , and reproducibility were as previously described for plasma analysis . ``
'' Area under the curve ( AUC ) values were calculated by computer-assisted integration of the intracellular levels of AMS580 or ATRA measured at various time after the addition of the two compounds to the culture medium .
RESULTS Cyto-differentiating effects of AMS580 , ATRA , and other retinoids in NB4 and HL-60 cells .
We determined the effects of AMS580 , CD2019 , and CD437 , three specific ligands for RARa , RAR/3 , and RAR y , `` respectively , on the granulocytic maturation of NB4 cells .
In addition , we tested CD367 `` and TTNPB , * two RAR-specific ligands with no selectivity for the various isoforms of this type of receptor , and 9-cis RA , an isomer of ATRA that interacts with both RAR and RXR isoforms . ``
The chemical structure of the various retinoids is shown in Fig 1 .
Granulocytic maturation of NB4 and HL-60 cells was initially studied by determining the levels of LAP enzymatic activity after treatment with the various retinoids in the presence of optimal concentrations CO437 on on ( ‘ \ ‘ O ok 26 0 Fig 1 .

of G-CSF . ``
In our experimental conditions , when cells are treated with retinoids alone ( at any given concentration ) or G-CSF alone ( 10 ng/mL ) , no increase in LAP expression is observed .
As shown in Fig 2A , in the presence of G-CSF , treatment of NB4 cells with ATRA , at concentrations between 107° and 107° mol/L , leads to a dose-dependent and robust increase in LAP enzymatic activity .
Maximal induction of the enzyme is observed after incubation with 10~ ' mol/L ATRA .
A similar dose-response curve is evident when ATRA is substituted by 9-cis RA .
Interestingly , TTNPB , CD367 , and AMS8O have very similar dose-response curves and cause maximal induction of LAP at concentrations that are two logarithms lower than those of ATRA and 9-cis RA necessary to produce the same effect .
Furthermore , the maximal level of induction is approximately threefold higher after exposure to the three synthetic retinoids than after exposure to ATRA or 9-cis RA .
At 10~° mol/L , ATRA and all the other synthetic retinoids increase LAP enzymatic activity submaximally , which is the consequence of a mild cytotoxic effect .
The compound CD2019 induces significant LAP enzymatic activity only at the highest doses tested ( 10~° and 10~° mol/L ) , and the level of induction is several fold lower than that caused by ATRA or 9-cis RA .
CD437 is totally inactive in this assay ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig 2B , in the presence of G-CSF ( 10 ng/mL ) , treatment of HL-60 cells with ATRA at concentrations between 10~ `` and 10~° mol/L causes an almost linear and dose-dependent increase in the levels of LAP activity .
However , at optimal concentrations of ATRA , the absolute amounts of LAP induced in HL-60 are threefold lower than those observed in NB4 cells .
Up to 107 `` mol/L , a similar LAP induction profile is observed when HL-60 cells are grown in the presence of G-CSF and 9-cis RA , TTNPB , or AMS80 .
CD367 is slightly more effective than ATRA or the other three retinoids at 10~ `` ° and 10~° mol/L , although this effect is lost at higher concentrations .
At 10~° mol/L , ATRA is more active than all the other retinoids and this higher potency is maintained at 10~° mol/L , although , at this concentration , a submaximal increase in LAP is observed .
Up to 10° mol/L , CD2019 and CD437 ( data not shown ) are totally inactive in modulating the levels of LAP enzymatic activity .
Taken together , the data indicate that ATRA , in combination with G-CSF , is the most effective retinoid in inducing LAP in HL-60 .
In further experiments , we focused our attention on AMS80 and we characterized the activity of this retinoid relative to that of ATRA .

- Induction of NB4 and HL-60 LAP enzymatic activity by various retinoids in combination with G-CSF .
NB4 ( A ) or HL-60 ( B ) were seeded at 4 x 10° cells/mL and treated with G-CSF ( 10 ng/mL ) or with G-CSF and the indicated concentrations of ATRA ( A ) , 9-cis RA ( M ) , CD2019 ( A ) , TTNPB ( C ) ) , CD367 ( O ) , CD2019 ( ¢ ) , or AMS8O ( @ ) for 4 days .
Cells were collected and processed for the determination of LAP enzymatic activity .
Treatment of NB4 or HL-60 cells for 4 days with the various retinoids at the indicated concentrations in the absence of G-CSF did not result in the expression of detectable levels of LAP activity ( < 10 mU/mg protein } .
Each experimental value is the mean + SD of three separate cultures .
fact that CD367 and TTNPB are very strong and toxic retinoids in vivo , `` whereas AMS80 has a better toxicologic profile ( unpublished results ) .
In APL cells , we showed that LAP is induced not only by the combination of ATRA and G-CSF but also by the combination between the retinoid and cAMP analogs . ``
Thus , expression of LAP was studied in NB4 and HL-60 cells , in the presence of various concentrations of AMS8O0 or ATRA and an optimal concentration of 8Br-cAMP ( 1 mmol/L ) .
In these experimental conditions , treatment of NB4 cells with AMS580 results in the induction of LAP at concentrations 100-fold lower than those necessary to obtain the same effect with ATRA .
In HL-60 cells the same combinations are ineffective `` ( data not reported ) .
This shows that induction of LAP enzymatic activity by AMS580 is independent of the second cyto-differentiating stimulus used in combination with the retinoid .
Figure 3A shows that , in the presence of G-CSF ( 10 ng/ mL ) , induction of LAP enzymatic activity in NB4 cells by AMS8O and ATRA is the result of an increase in the steady-state levels of the corresponding transcript .
Consistent with the results obtained by measurement of LAP activity , AMS8O is substantially more active than ATRA in causing accumulation of the corresponding mRNA .
In the presence of G-CSF , AMS80 ( at 10~° mol/L ) produces a remarkable induction in LAP mRNA , whereas , in the same experimental conditions and at the same concentration , ATRA is totally ineffective .
At a concentration of 10~ `` mol/L , AMS80 and ATRA , in combination with G-CSF , induce almost the same level of LAP transcript .
The Northern blot does not show LAP mRNA upregulation on treatment of cells with 10° mol/L CD2019 .
As shown by Fig 3B , in HL-60 cells , LAP mRNA accumulation is more dramatic in the presence of ATRA + G-CSF than in the presence of AMS80 + G-CSF .
In fact , at 10~° mol/L and 10~® mol/L , ATRA causes a 10-fold and threefold higher upregulation of LAP transcript than AMS8O0 .
This finding is again in line with what observed at the level of LAP enzymatic activity .
To evaluate the effects of AMS8O0 and ATRA on other granulocytic maturation-associated markers , we determined the level of expression of CD1 1b , CD33 , and G-CSF receptor mRNA in NB4 and HL-60 cells .
As shown in Fig 4 ( left panels ) , CD11b is not expressed in NB4 in basal conditions , whereas CD33 is present on the majority of blasts .
After treatment with ATRA for 4 days , the number of NB4 cells expressing CD11b increases , starting from 10~ ' mol/L , and is maximal at 10~° mol/L .
Relative to what is observed with ATRA , the dose-response curve of AMS8O0 for the surface expression of CD1 1b is shifted towards the left by more than 2 logs .
In fact , the number of CD11b* cells is already high at 10~° mol/L and is maximal at 10~° mol/L .
In the presence of ATRA and AMS580 , G-CSF enhances the surface expression of CD1 1b relative to what is observed with the retinoids alone .
In the case of AMS58O , this effect is evident only at 10~ `` mol/L , whereas , in the case of ATRA , enhancement is observed at levels greater than 10~° mol/L .
Notice that , even in the presence of G-CSF , maximal upregulation of CD11b by ATRA is lower than that observed in the presence of AMS8O alone .
After 4 days in the presence of G-CSF , AMS58O is more potent than ATRA in decreasing the amounts of CD33 present on the surface of NB4 cells , although the difference between the effects caused by the two retinoids is less remarkable than that observed on CD11b expression .
Data on CD33 levels after treatment of NB4 with G-CSF ( 10 ng/mL ) , ATRA ( 10~ ' `` ° to 10~° mol/L ) , or AMS580 ( 10- `` ° to 107° mol/L ) alone are not documented , because they are not significantly different from what is observed in control conditions .
As shown in the right panels of Fig 4 , in basal conditions , HL-60 cells are CD11b~ and CD33* .
ATRA causes maximal induction of CD11b at 10~ ' mol/L , whereas AMS8O effectively upregulates the surface marker only at 10~° mol/L .
However , even at this concentration , the number From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Effects of ATRA and other retinoids in combination with G-CSF on the levels of LAP mRNA in NB4 and HL-60 cells .
NB4 ( A ) or HL-60 ( B ) cells ( 4 x 10°/mL ) were treated for 4 days with medium alone ( medium } , medium containing 10 ng/ml G-CSF , and medium containing the indicated concentrations of ATRA , CD2019 , or AMS80 , each alone or in combination with G-CSF .
Total RNA was extracted and loaded ( 10 g for each lane ) on a 1 % formaldehyde/agarose gel .
RNA was transferred by capillarity onto a nylon membrane that was subsequently processed for Northern blot analysis .
The same membrane was sequentially hybridized with LAP and GGPDH cDNAs .
The molecular weight of LAP mRNA is approximately 2.5 kb and that of G6PDH is approximately 2.6 kb .
Autoradiograms were quantitated by densitometry and the intensity of each LAP mRNA signal was normalized for the intensity of the relative GGPDH mRNA signal .
Results are indicated above each autoradiogram and are expressed as the percentage of the highest value ( AM580 10° mol/L + G-CSF in the case of NB4 and ATRA 10 ° mol/ L + G-CSF in the case of HL-60 cells ) taken as 100. of CD11b®* cells is significantly lower than that observed in the presence of ATRA .
In this cell line , surface expression of CD33 is left unaltered after challenge with the combinations of G-CSF and ATRA or AMS80 .
In both NB4 and HL-60 cells , the mean associated fluorescence of CDI11b* and CD33 `` cells is very similar in all the experimental conditions tested ( data not shown ) .
In NB4 cells , maximal expression of G-CSF receptor mRNA is observed on treatment with ATRA at high concen-trations .
`` * The addition of G-CSF to the medium containing ATRA does not further enhance the accumulation of the transcript . ``
'' Figure 5A shows that 4 days of treatment of NB4 cells with AMS80 ( at 10~® mol/L ) leads to an approximately sixfold increase in the steady-state levels of the transcript coding for the G-CSF receptor , whereas , at the same concentration , ATRA does not significantly upregulate the basal level of expression of this mRNA .
At 10 ~ mol/L , ATRA and AMS80 are both effective in upregulating the expression of the G-CSF receptor transcript , whereas G-CSF ( at 10 ng/ mL ) and CD2019 ( at 10~® and 10~° mol/L ) , which are used as negative controls , are totally inactive in this respect .
In HL-60 cells ( Fig 5B ) , only ATRA at 10 ~ `` mol/L is capable of significantly augmenting ( approximately S5-fold ) the relative amounts of the cytokine receptor mRNA .
G-CSF ( at 10 ng/ mL ) and AMS80 ( at 10~® and 10~° mol/L ) do not change the basal level of expression of the mRNA .
Taken together , the data so far presented show that AMS8O0 is a more powerful cyto-differentiating agent than ATRA in NB4 , whereas it is less potent than the natural retinoid in HL-60 cells .
The selective cyto-differentiating action of AMS80 on NB4 is not accompanied by a similar selectivity on cell growth .
In fact , at the concentrations tested ( 10~® mol/L for NB4 and 10~° mol/L for HL-60 ) , AMS80 and ATRA show equivalent levels of growth inhibition in both cell lines .
In addition , pharmacodynamic effects do not explain the phenomenon , because the peak intracellular levels , as well as the rate of accumulation and disappearance of the two compounds , are similar in both cell lines ( data not shown ) .
Indeed , over a 4-day period , the calculated AUCs of AMS80 and ATRA are 13.4 and 10.5 ng/10° cells per day for NB4 and 12.4 and 6.1 ng/10° cells per day for HL-60 , which does not correlate with the relative biologic activity of AMS80 and ATRA in the two cell types .
Cyto-differentiating effects of AM580 and ATRA in freshly isolated APL and CML cells .
As NB4 expresses PML-RAR , whereas HL-60 does not express it , the data obtained in the two APL experimental models suggest that AMS80 cyto-differentiating activity may be higher in cells containing the aberrant retinoic acid receptor .
To support this hypothe-sis , we studied LAP enzymatic activity in freshly isolated APL cells and CML granulocytes challenged in vitro with AMS80 and ATRA alone or in combination with G-CSF .
CML granulocytes represent a useful source of myeloid cells lacking PML-RAR , because they express RARa ( unpub- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Effect of AM580 , ATRA , and the combination of the two compounds with G-CSF on the expression of the myeloid surface markers CD11b and CD33 .
NB4 cells ( left panels ) and HL6O cells ( right panels ) were seeded at 4 x 10° cells/mL and incubated for 4 days in medium containing increasing concentrations of ATRA ( triangles ) or AMS8O ( circles ) either in the absence ( open symbols ) or in the presence of 10 ng/ mL G-CSF ( solid symbols ) .
The number of cells positive for the expression of CD11b ( upper panels } and CD33 ( lower panels ) were quantitated by flow cytometry .
For each experimental point , appropriate controls consisting of cells decorated with an irrelevant monoclonal antibody of the same isotype were performed .
In these controls , less than 2 % of the cells show background fluorescence ; thus the results are not presented in the figure .
lished results ) and respond to the challenge with combinations of ATRA and G-CSF with an induction of LAP . ``
As shown in Fig 6 , in the presence of 10 ng/mL G-CSF , AM580 maximally induces LAP enzymatic activity at concentrations that are one logarithm lower than those necessary to obtain the same effect with ATRA .
However , individual variability in the shape of the dose-response curve and in the concentration of the two retinoids causing maximal induction of LAP is evident .
Indeed , APL cells from patients no .
2 and 3 , respectively , are the most and the least sensitive to the effects of both AMS8O and ATRA .
After treatment of CML granulocytes for 3 days with 10 ng/mL G-CSF and increasing concentrations of ATRA or AMS80 , a dose-dependent induction of LAP is evident .
In all the cases ana-lyzed , ATRA is equally effective ( patients no .
1 and 4 ) or more potent ( patients no .
2 , 3 , and 5 ) than AMS580 in inducing LAP enzymatic activity .
In freshly isolated APL cells , induction of LAP by the combination of G-CSF and ATRA or AMS58O0 is the consequence of an increased accumulation of the corresponding transcript , as shown by Northern blot experiments performed on RNA extracted from the blasts of APL patient no .
4 ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig 7 , AMS80 is more effective than ATRA in inducing the surface expression of CD11b in APL cells derived from patient no .
1 .
In fact , AMS80 at 10~° mol/L is sufficient to cause the appearance of CD11b on the majority of APL cells and higher concentrations of the retinoid do not give rise to a further recruitment of positive cells or an increase in the mean associated fluorescence .
By contrast , for ATRA , a concentration of 10~° mol/L is necessary to induce maximal expression of CD11b on the majority of APL cells .
In this particular APL case , CD33 is not modulated by either AMS8O or ATRA , and CD11b is a more sensitive differentiation marker than LAP .
With respect to the last point , CD1ib is upregulated at concentrations of both AMS80 and ATRA that are lower than the respective concentrations of the two retinoids necessary to induce LAP in combination with G-CSF ( compare Fig 7 with Fig 6 ) .
A similar analysis was conducted on a second APL case ( patient no .
4 ) , where maximal induction of CD11lb was observed at 10~° mol/L , in the presence of AMS580 , and at 10~® mol/L in the presence of ATRA ( data not shown ) .
Binding of AM5380 and ATRA in the presence of RARa and PML-RAR .
- The selective cyto-differentiating action of AMS8O on APL cells may be related to a peculiar capacity of the retinoid to interact with PML-RAR .
To test this hy-pothesis , we evaluated the ability of the retinobenzoic compound to displace the binding of CD367 on PML-RAR and RARa , because direct binding experiments are prevented by the lack of availability of radiolabeled AMS8O0 .
CD367 was selected as the ligand , because it binds to the various forms of RAR with the same affinity as ATRA .
In addition , this synthetic compound is more stable and gives lower nonspe-cific binding than the natural retinoid . ``
Binding experiments were performed on nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA encoding PML-RAR or RARa .

Effects of AM580 , ATRA , CD2019 , and G-CSF on the levels of G-CSF receptor mRNA in NB4 and HL-60 cells .
NB4 ( left panel ) or HL-60 ( right panel ) cells ( 4 x 10°/mL ) were treated for 4 days with medium alone ( medium ) , medium containing 10 ng/mL G-CSF , and medium containing the indicated concentrations of AM580 , ATRA , or CD2019 .
Total RNA was extracted and loaded ( 10 mg for each lane ) on a 1 % formaldehyde/agarose gel .
RNA was transferred by capillarity onto a nylon membrane that was subsequently processed for Northern blot analysis .
The same membrane was sequentially hybridized with the G-CSF receptor ( G-CSF-R ) and G6PDH cDNAs .
The molecular weight of the G-CSF receptor mRNA is approximately 3.0 kb and that of GGPDH is approximately 2.6 kb .
Autoradiograms were quantitated by densitometry and the intensity of each G-CSF receptor mRNA signal was normalized for the intensity of the relative G6PDH mRNA signal .
Results are indicated above each autoradiogram and are expressed as the percentage of the highest value ( AM5S80 10~° mol/L in the case of NB4 and ATRA 10~° mol/L in the case of HL-60 cells ) taken as 100. tography .
Typical chromatograms are shown in Fig 8A .
RARa-bound CD367 elutes in a discrete peak at an apparent molecular mass of around 50 to 60 kD ( fractions No .
31-36 ) , as assessed by calibration of the column with appropriate proteins of known molecular weight ( data not shown ) .
This is the expected molecular weight of RARa .
`` `` * `` The elution profile of PML-RAR-bound CD367 is more complex and consists of two peaks .
A major peak , representing approximately 80 % of the bound radiactivity , which elutes with the void volume of the column ( fractions no .
21 through 27 ) , and a minor one that elutes at a molecular mass of approximately 100 kD ( fractions no .
30 through 34 ) .
The first PML-RAR peak represents aggregates of the recep- tor , `` `` *** `` and the second one is probably the monomeric form of the protein .
`` `` ** We observed that the proportion of the two PML-RAR species is always the same , as determined in a large series of independent experiments .
In addition , the saturation curve of radiolabeled CD367 is the same for the two peaks ( see below ) .
Finally , CD367-associated radioactivity is displaced from the two peaks of protein by cold C€D367 , ATRA , and AMS580 with a similar Ki .
Thus , determination of PML-RAR binding constants of the various retinoids is the same , regardless of the fact that analysis is conducted on peak I , peak II , or the combinations of the two peaks .
The nuclear extract obtained from untransfected COS-7 cells bind less than 1 % of the CD367 bound to that derived from cells transfected with PML-RAR or RARa .
Radiolabeled CD367 is completely displaced from both retinoid receptors by a 200-fold excess of the cold ligand .
With the use of this binding assay , we generated saturation curves that showed that the Kd for the binding of tritiated CD367 to both PML-RAR and RARa is the same and is approximately 1 nmol/L .
Using this concentration of radiolabeled CD367 , the binding of this retinoid to PML-RAR and RARa was displaced by increasing concentrations of ATRA or AMS80 .
Typical Hill 's plots for ATRA and AMS8O are shown in Fig 8B .
The Ki ( mean + SD of 3 independent experiments ) of AMS80 and ATRA for the inhibition of CD367 binding to PML-RAR and RARa , respectively , are shown in Table 1 .
ATRA has an affinity for PML-RAR that is almost fourfold lower than that for RARa , whereas no statistically significant difference between the binding of AMS80 to the two receptors is observed .
In both the cases of PML-RAR and RARa , the Ki of AMS80 is higher than that of ATRA .
These data strongly suggest that ATRA is a slightly better ligand to both PML-RAR and RARa than AMS580 and that both compounds bind better to the aberrant than the wild-type receptor .

CYTO-DIFFERENTIATING EFFECTS OF AM580 ON APL Transactivation potential of AM580 and ATRA in the presence of RARa and PML-RAR .

In these controls , less than 2 % of the cells show background fluorescence ; thus the results are not presented in the figure .
unless optimal concentrations of G-CSF or cAMP analogs are simultaneously present in the growth medium ( Fig 2 and Sato et al `` `` ) .
To perform these experiments , COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with PML-RAR or RARa in the presence of the appropriate reporter and subsequently treated with increasing concentrations of AMS580 or ATRA .
Typical results of these experiments are shown in Fig 9 .
In the presence of PML-RAR ( left panels ) , AMS8O has a better transactivating potential than ATRA on the three reporter genes , whereas the two retinoids have similar activity in the presence of RARa ( right panels ) .
A summary of the results obtained in several experiments are shown in Table 1 .
If results are expressed as EC , , , ie , the concentration of the retinoid giving half of the maximal induction of each pro-moter , it is evident that ATRA transactivates each promoter in a similar fashion either in the presence of PML-RAR or in the presence of RARa .
By contrast , PML-RAR mediates the activity of AMS580 better than RARa , regardless of the promoter taken into consideration .
For LAP CAT , TRE-TK CAT and B ; -RARE CAT , the transactivation potential of AMS58O is approximately 8- , 20- , and 3-fold higher , respectively , in the presence of PML-RAR than in the presence of RARa .

relative to RARa seems to be an intrinsic characteristic of this compound , although a low ECs , for the transactivation of RARE-containing genes in the presence of the aberrant retinoic acid receptor is shared by TTNPB and CD367 .
In fact , in the presence of PML-RAR , TTNPB and CD367 transactivate TRE-TK CAT , with ECs , s of 0.4 and 0.5 x 10~° mol/L , respectively , whereas , in the presence of RARa , the two compounds transactivate the same reporter gene , with ECs , s of 0.03 and 0.3 x 107° mol/L , respectively ( re-sults are the mean of two experiments , with ECs , values varying less than 20 % between each other ) .
Thus , TTNPB shows inverse selectivity relative to AMS580 , whereas CD367 is a nonselective transactivator of PML-RAR and RARa .
DISCUSSION In this report , we show that AM580 , a synthetic benzoic derivative of ATRA , originally developed as a RARa-spe-cific agonist , *** `` is considerably more active than the natu- ral retinoid in causing granulocytic maturation of APL cells .
This is observed on a series of differentiation markers that can be modulated by retinoids alone or by the combination of these compounds and other differentiating agents .
Cyto-differentiation is observed at concentrations of AMS580 that are at least one logarithm lower than those necessary to obtain similar results with ATRA .
In addition , the level of induction of a series of markers attained at low concentrations of the retinobenzoic derivative can not be obtained even with high concentrations of ATRA .
AMS580 shows cosidera-ble cell specificity , because it is more active than ATRA in NB4 and freshly isolated APL promyelocytes and much less active than the natural retinoid in HL-60 cells and CML granulocytes .
Notably , ATRA is more powerful than AMS580 in two other nonhematopoietic cell lines .
In F9 teratocarcinoma cells , ATRA is more effective than AMS580 in inducing tissue plasminogen activator and L/B/K-type alkaline phos-phatase . ``
Furthermore , in L929 fibroblasts , when associated to cAMP analogs , the natural retinoid is more powerful than the synthetic compound in inducing L/B/K-type alkaline From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

CYTO-DIFFERENTIATING EFFECTS OF AM580 ON APL phosphatase activity ( unpublished results ) .
Whereas freshly isolated APL promyelocytes and NB4 cells express PMLRAR besides the normal RARa protein , CML granulocytes , HL-60 , F9 , and L929 cells do not synthesize PML-RAR .
Taken together , all these results show that , whereas AMS580 is an active retinoid in cells containing the normal RARa , the potential of this compound is remarkably enhanced in PML-RAR-expressing cells .
PML-RAR is believed to have an important role in causing the granulocytic maturation of APL cells observed in the presence of ATRA . ``
Thus , it is conceivable that the aberrant retinoic acid receptor may represent the primary target for the activity of AMS80 in APL cells .
Our data show that both ATRA and AMS8O0 have better binding affinities for PMLRAR than for RARa .
However , these differences in affinity are small .
In addition , the Ki of ATRA for CD367 binding to PML-RAR is lower than that of AMS8O0 .
This suggests that differences in PML-RAR affinity do not explain the different ability of the two retinoids to induce granulocytic maturation in APL cells .
We observe a strong correlation between the transactivation of PML-RAR by AMS80 and the cyto-differentiating effect of the retinoid on APL cells .
In fact , whereas three different reporter genes are similarly activated by ATRA both in the presence of RARa and PML-RAR , AMS80 activates the same reporters much better in the presence of the aberrant receptor .
Furthermore , AMS80 transactivates PMLRAR more potently and at significantly lower concentrations than ATRA , although the strength of the effect depends on the reporter taken into consideration .
The specific interaction between AMS8O0 and PML-RAR may , at least partially , explain why this compound is such an active cyto-differentiating agent in APL cells and why its activity is superior to Table 1 .

Effects of AM58O and ATRA on the activity of RARE-containing promoters in the presence of PML-RAR and RARa .
COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with LAP CAT ( containing the alkaline phosphatase gene upstream promoter ) , TRE-TKCAT ( containing an artificial inverted repeat RARE placed in front of the viral thymidine kinase promoter ) } , B ; RARECAT ( containing a natural direct repeat RARE placed in front of the viral thymidine kinase promoter ) , pnisLACZ ( containing the bacterial B-galactosidase gene under the control of a constitutive promoter ) , and the indicated form of RAR .
Sixteen hours after transfection , medium was changed and the incubation continued for a further 36 hours with the indicated concentrations of AMS580 ( @ ) or ATRA ( O ) .
At the end of each treatment , cells were harvested and processed for the measurement of CAT and B-galactosidase activity .
The results are the mean + SD of three replicate dishes and are expressed as relative CAT activity , which is the ratio of CAT activity produced by the reporter in cpm of acetylated chloramphenicol divided by the B-galactosidase activity expressed in absorbance units at 420 nm .
that of ATRA in this particular leukemic cell type .
Like AMS80 , CD367 and TTNPB are much more powerful than ATRA in inducing granulocytic maturation of NB4 cells .
Interestingly , in the presence of PML-RAR , CD367 and TTNPB transactivate TRE-TK CAT at concentrations that are almost identical to those necessary to obtain the same effects with AMS8O0 .
Thus , strong interaction with PMLRAR at low concentrations and potent cyto-differentiating activity in NB4 cells are features common to AMS580 , TTNPB , and €CD367 .
Although interaction with PML-RAR may be the basis for the pharmacologic activity of the three retinobenzoic agents in APL cells , this does not rule out the possibility that other molecular mechanisms have a role .
With respect to this , the three compounds are RAR -selective ligands , unlike ATRA and 9-cis RA , which activate both RARs and RXRs ( the effect of ATRA on RXRs is the consequence of spontaneous or enzymatic isomerization to the 9 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

1530 cis isomer ) .
The lack of interaction with RXRs may be of significance for the superiority of retinobenzoic derivatives on ATRA and 9-cis RA in APL cells , especially in consideration of the fact that RXR activation does not seem to be required for the granulocytic differentiation of myeloid cells . ``
In APL cells , three major breakpoint clusters on chromosome 15 ( ber-type I , II , and HI ) , which results in the expression of three distinct types of PML-RAR fusion proteins , have been recognized . '
'' Although the number of cases analyzed is small , the selective action of AMS80 on PML-RAR containing APL blast seems to be independent of the type of aberrant retinoic acid receptor expressed .
In fact , the series of APL cases analyzed includes four ber-type I ( NB4 cells , patients no .
2 , 3 , and 4 ) and one ber-type III ( patient no .
1 ) t ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal rearrangements .
It would be important to establish whether the three types of PML-RARs are equally effective in transactivating RARE-containing genes in the presence of AMS80 .
Similarly , studies are required to investigate whether the retinobenzoic analog is active in APL relapse cases showing biologic resistance to ATRA .
With respect to this last point , it is worthwhile mentioning that the compound is totally ineffective in inducing granulocytic differentiation ( unpublished observations ) of a recently in vitro developed ATRA-resistant NB4 clone . ``
However , this is probably expected , as this cell line does not express the PML-RAR fusion protein , `` which seems to be the target for the activity of AMS580 .
Regardless of the mechanism of action , AMS580 is much more interesting than CD367 and TTNPB from a perspective therapeutical point of view .
In vivo , the retinoic acid-mi-metic activity of the two latter compounds is very strong ; however , both €CD367 and TTNPB show significant systemic toxicity `` ( unpublished observations ) , probably as a consequence of their promiscous ability to interact with RARa , , and y .
The toxicologic profile of AMS580 in animals and humans is not yet completely known , although it looks favor-able .
This probably reflects the ability of the compound to significantly interact only with RARa in normal animals .
The results obtained with AMS8O0 show that it is possible to develop retinoic acid derivatives that preferentially interact with PML-RAR and are more effective than ATRA in causing granulocytic differentiation of APL cells .
Such compounds may show lower toxicity and a higher therapeutic index than ATRA in the treatment of this type of leukemia .
