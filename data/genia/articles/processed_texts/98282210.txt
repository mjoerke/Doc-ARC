Bohlander The translocation t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 ; q14 ) has been observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) as well as acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) .
A recent study showed a MLL/AFTO fusion in all cases of AML with t ( 10 ; 11 ) and various breakpoints on chromosome 11 ranging from q13 to g23 .
We recently cloned CALM ( Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia gene ) , the fusion partner of AFTZO at 11q14 in the monocytic cell line U937 .
To further define the role of these genes in acute leukemias , 10 cases ( 9 AML and 1 ALL ) with cytogenetically proven t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p12-14 ; q13-21 ) and well-characterized morphology , immunophenotype , and clinical course were analyzed .
Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) was performed with 2 YACs flanking the CALM region , a YAC contig of the MLL region , and a YAC spanning the AFIO breakpoint .
Rearrangement of at least one of these genes was detected in all cases with balanced t ( 10 ; 11 ) .
In 4 cases , including 3 AML with immature morphology ( 1 AML-MO and 2 AML-M1 ) and 1 ALL , the signals of the CALM YACS were ALIGNANT TRANSFORMATION is a multistep pro cess that involves the sequential alteration of genes regulating cell growth and/or differentiation .
Many of the genes involved in leukemogenesis have been identified by the molecular analysis of nonrandom chromosome abnormalities .

The rare , but recurring translocation t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 ; q14 ) has been observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) as well as acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . ``
A recent study showed a MLL/AF1O fusion in all cases of AML with t ( 10 ; 11 ) and various breakpoints on chromosome 11q , including 6 cases with rearrangement of chromosomal band 11413 . ``
MLL ( also called ALL1 , Hirx1 , and HRX ) is involved in translocations with up to 40 different translocation partner genes in AML as well as acute lymphoid leukemia , including the t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 ; q23 ) in AML .

MLL was rearranged in 3 AML with myelomonocytic differentiation ( 2 AML-M2 and 1 AML-M5 ) , including 1 secondary AML .
In all 3 cases , a characteristic immunophenotype was identified ( CD4+ , CD13-~ , CD33+t , CD65st ) .
AF-10 was involved in 5 of 6 evaluable cases , including 1 case without detectable CALM or MLL rearrangement .
In 2 complex translocations , none of the three genes was rearranged .
All cases had a remarkably poor prognosis , with a mean survival of 9.6 + 6.6 months .
For the 7 AML cases that were uniformly treated according to the AMLCG86/92 protocols , disease-free and overall survival w as significantly w orse than for the overall study group ( P = .03 and P = .01 , respectively ) .
We conclude that the t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 ; q14 ) indicates CALM and MLL rearrangements in morphologically distinct subsets of acute leukemia and may be associated with a poor prognosis .

( inversions/insertions ) , because they are transcribed in opposite direction relative to the telomere/centromere orientation.© These complex rearrangements may be interpreted as t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 ; q14-21 ) .
The molecular characterization of the t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 ; q14 ) in the monocytic cell line U937 identified a different breakpoint on chromosome 11 , involving the previously unknown gene CALM . ``
CALM has a very high homology to the murine clathrin assembly protein ap-3 . ``
'' Interestingly , both translocations t ( 10 ; 11 ) have the same fusion partner gene on chromosome 10 , the putative transcription factor AFIO .

6 To further define the involvement of the three genes AFIO , CALM , and MLL in acute leukemias , we analyzed 10 cases ( 9 AML and 1 ALL ) with cytogenetically proven t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p12-14 ; q13-21 ) and well-characterized morphology , immunophenotype , and clinical course .
Only cytogenetic material stored in fixative for several years was available , which was not suitable for an analysis at the RNA level .
An interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) approach was chosen . ``
Nonchimeric YACs from the genomic region of the three genes were used .
A translocation was assumed when one of the YAC signals was split resulting in three hybridization signals in a diploid interphase nucleus .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient samples .
- This study was designed and performed according to the updated declaration of Helsinki .
Patient material was collected from 725 cases that entered the studies of the German AML Cooperative Group 86 and 92 and that were subjected to cytogenetic analysis . ``
'' Based on the cytogenetic data and the availability of material , 8 cases with t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p12-14 ; q13-21 ) were identified ( Table 1 ) .
In addition , 1 adult ALL ( no .
10 ) and 1 infant AML ( mo .
6 ) with t ( 10 ; 11 ) were included in this series .
All cases were morphologically classified according to the French-American-British ( FAB ) criteria and were reviewed by an independent reference hematologist ( HL . )

FISH probes .
- YAC-derived FISH probes were generated either by a sequence-independent amplification technique or nick translation ( MLL YACs ) .232 For AFIO , a YAC ( 80763 , 1,050 kb ) from the Centre d'Etude Polymorphisme Humain ( CEPH ) library had been previously identified that spans the breakpoint region on 10p and reliably detects the breakpoint in U937 .
!
+ For MLL , we used a pool of two YACs ( 785c6 and 856b9 ) that span the MLL gene and approximately 1.0 mega-bp of distally flanking sequences , because 11g23 translocations are often associated with interstitial deletions . '
'' 525 For CALM , the Mega-YAC Library from CEPH was screened with the previously reported CALM primers NG.T45 and NG.B362 . ``
In addition , 5 flanking YACs of the region were identified using the Whitehead web pages ( www.genome.wi.mit.edu ) .2 `` `` A total of 9 YACs were evaluated by FISH for chimerism ( hybridization with normal peripheral blood cells ) and were mapped relative to the CALM breakpoint ( hybridization with U937 ) .
Based on the intensity of hybridization signal , 2 YACs ( proximal 785c1 , 1,390 kb , and distal 914D9 , 1,190 kb ) were chosen for interphase analysis .
From 4664 Hybridization .
Dual-color FISH was performed with the two YAC-derived probes of the CALM region as well as the AFIO YAC or the MLL probe and the corresponding centromeric probe ( CEP10 and CEP11 Spectrum Orange ; Vysis , Downers Grove , IL ) to exclude numerical chromosomal aberrations ( Fig 1 ) .
FISH was performed as previously described . ``
Briefly , the hybridization solution contained approximately 0.1 ug of each probe , 1 ug human Cot1l-DNA , 0.6 ug human placental DNA , and 1 ug salmon sperm DNA/slide in a 10 uL volume .
The probes were either directly labeled with Cy-3-dUTP ( Vysis ) or biotinylated and detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated avidin and amplified with antiavidin-FITC ( 16-Bio-dUTP [ Boehringer Mannheim , Germany ] ; FITC-avidin and FITC anti-avidin [ Vector , Burlingame , CAJ ) .
The slides were counterstained with 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI ) and were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) .
For each case , at least 100 single , intact interphase cells were analyzed .
For Fig 1 , separate gray scale images of DAPI-stained cells and fluorescence signals were captured using a charge-coupled device camera ( Xillix , Richmond , British Columbia , Canada ) and were pseudocolored and merged using Adobe Photoshop software ( Adobe Systems , Mountain View , CA ) .

DREYLING ET AL RESULTS Patients ' characteristics .
- Our study group included 1 adult T-ALL ( no .
10 , Table 1 ) , 1 infant AML ( no .
6 ) , and 8 adult AML .
The morphology of the myeloid leukemias were classified as immature ( FAB MO ) in 1 case ( no .
8 ) and as leukemia with minimal maturation ( FAB M1 ) in 3 cases ( no .
5 , 7 , and 9 ) .
Significant maturation at or beyond the promyelocyte stage ( FAB M2 ) was diagnosed in 2 cases ( no .
2 and 3 ) and monocytic differentiation ( FAB M35 ) in 3 cases ( no .
1 , 4 , and 6 ) .
Leukocyte counts at presentation were high , but varied significantly within the study group ( mean , 23,900/uL ; range , 200 to 60,800/uL ) .
All patients with t ( 10 ; 11 ) were rather young ( 36.7 + 19.9 years old ) .
There was no gender bias ( 5 male and 5 female ) .
FISH/cytogenetics .
- Rearrangements of AFIO and/or either CALM or MLL were detected in all cases with balanced t ( 10 ; 11 ) .
MLL rearrangements were detected in 3 of 8 cases ( no .

MLL AND CALM ARE FUSED TO AFIO IN ( 10 ; 11 ) All 5 cases of 7 with MLL or CALM rearrangements , which were evaluable , had a rearrangement of AFIO .
In addition , in 1 case ( no .
6 ) with a balanced translocation t ( 10 ; 11 ) , the AFIO probe was split , indicating a breakpoint within this region , but no MLL or CALM rearrangements were detected .
No rearrangements were detected in the 2 patients with complex rearrangements ( no .
4 and 5 ) .
However , for case no .
4 , cell material was only sufficient for hybridization with the CALM probes .
Morphology and immunophenotype .
- All cases with MLL rearrangement showed a myeloid maturation at or beyond the promyelocyte stage or a monocytic morphology according to the FAB classification ( M2 or M5 ) , including 1 secondary AML after treatment for high malignant T-cell lymphoma .
! ``
In contrast , cases with CALM rearrangement showed a rather immature phenotype ( MO or M1 ) .
In fact , case no .
8 was initially misdiagnosed as ALL and treated accordingly .
A CALM rearrangement was detected in the only ALL in this series .
The morphological diagnosis was confirmed by the typical immunophenotype with expression of various T-cell antigens and coexpression of CD10 , but absence of a myeloid marker ( CD11c ) or B-cell antigens .
A complete immunophenotype was available in only 1 of 3 AML with CALM rearrangement ( no .
7 ) .
In agreement with the undifferentiated morphology of this case , leukemic blasts expressed antigens often associated with immature morphologic subtypes ( ie , CD7 and CD34 ) .
Of the panmyeloid antigens tested , only CD13 was weakly expressed .
Additionally , however , strong positivity of myeloperoxidase was found .
All 3 cases with MLL rearrangement were positive for the panmyeloid antigens CD33 and CD65s but lacked CD13 and CD15 and coexpressed CD4 .
Expression of markers associated with immaturity varied .
In addition , 1 case ( no .
1 ) showed coexpression of CD7 and CD10 .
Clinical course .
- In agreement with previous reports , hyper-leukocytosis was detected in all cases with MLL rearrangements ( mean , 35,000/uL ; range , 13,800 to 60,800/uL ) .5° > 3 Leukocyte counts were also high in cases with CALM rearrangements ( mean , 27,400/uL ; range , 1,300 to 60,800/uL ) .
However , the number of cases is too small for statistical evaluation .
The overall survival of the total group was remarkably poor ( 9.6 + 6.6 months ) , although , initially , 5 of 8 evaluable patients reached a complete remission .
There was no significant difference between patients with MLL or CALM rearrangements .
For 4665 the 7 patients who were treated according to the AMLCG86/92 protocol , disease-free survival and overall survival were 5 + 4.9 months and 11 + 7.2 months , respectively .
The survival data of these patients were significantly worse than for the overall study group .
After 14 months , none of the t ( 10 ; 11 ) patients but 40 % of the overall group were still disease-free ( P = .03 , y `` ) , and after 19 months , none of the t ( 10 ; 11 ) patients but 49 % of the overall group were still alive ( P = .01 , x2 ; Fig 2 ) .

8 DISCUSSION The translocation t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 ; q14 ) is a recurring chromosomal abnormality that has been observed in acute lymphoblastic as well as AML .
* `` On the molecular level , two types of t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p12-p14 ; q13-q21 ) have been characterized so far .
One type results in a MLL/AFIO fusion , the other causes a CALM/ AFIO fusion . '
> '* We performed this study to define the relevance of MLL and CALM rearrangements in acute leukemia with t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 ; q13-21 ) .
Both types of rearrangements were detected with similar frequency in cases with balanced translocation t ( 10 ; 11 ) .
CALM was rearranged in AML as well as in ALL .
Interestingly , the AML cases with CALM rearrangement had a rather immature morphology , and 1 case was initially misdiagnosed as ALL .
This may have been also the case for some of the initially reported ALL cases with t ( 10 ; 11 ) when immunophenotyping was not yet routinely performed . ``
However , our series included a well-characterized lymphoblastic leukemia as well as myeloid leukemias , suggesting that CALM may play a critical role in the early progenitor/stem cell before either myeloid or lymphoid differentiation takes place .
CALM has a very high homology to ap-3 , a murine clathrin assembly protein . ``
So far , CALM is the only protein interacting with clathrin that has been found to be involved in malignant transformation .
A transactivation domain that was recently identified in CALM could be critical for the transformation potential of CALM/AFIO . ``
'' However , further studies are necessary to define the precise mechanism by which the CALM/AFIO fusion contributes to malignant transformation .
In contrast to the rather undifferentiated morphology of myeloid leukemias with CALM rearrangement , cases with MLL rearrangement showed a monocytic morphology or a myeloid maturation beyond the promyelocyte stage .
Accordingly , all previously reported leukemias with t ( 10 ; 11 ) and rearrangement of MLL either detected by FISH or by other molecular 110411 ) : N=7 ( Cens .

4666 techniques , were AML-M4 or Similarly , MLL rearrangements in general are strongly correlated with monocytic or myelomonocytic phenotypes . ``
'' `` `` In contrast , Poirel et al `` `` detected MLL rearrangements in 20 % of AML-M1 .
However , these translocations did not involve chromosome 10 .
In fact , although MLL rearrangements are detected in AML as well as ALL , different translocation partner genes are usually involved . ``
'' For example , t ( 4 ; 11 ) and t ( 11 ; 19 ) ( q23 ; p13.3 ) are detected in ALL , whereas t ( 6 ; 11 ) , t ( 9 ; 11 ) , and t ( 11 ; 19 ) ( q23 ; pl3.1 ) are common translocations in various subtypes of AML . ``
Therefore , the results of Poirel et al `` `` that included t ( 6 ; 11 ) , t ( 9 ; 11 ) , and an uncharacterized t ( 11 ; 19 ) might not be applicable to leukemias with t ( 10 ; 11 ) .
In accordance with a previously published series of AML with MLL rearrangements , in our series , all 3 cases with MLL rearrangement were CD4* , CD13~ , CD33* , CD65s* . ``
'' The latter three markers are panmyeloid markers that are rather broadly expressed . ``
Therefore , this immunophenotype does not represent an aberrant expression of different lineage- or maturity-specific markers as detected in the majority of leuke-mias . ``
'' Hence , we do not consider this immunophenotype as leukemia-specific for MLL translocation , although the only completely characterized AML with CALM rearrangement had a clearly distinct immunophenotype ( CD4- , CD13* , CD33~ , CD65s- ) .
AFIO is the first fusion partner of MLL , which is fused to another gene in a different translocation , emphasizing its important role in malignant transformation .
It is thought that AFIO functions as a transcription factor and that the zinc finger might constitute a DNA binding domain . '
> ' `` Interestingly , 1 case with a balanced translocation t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( no .
6 ) showed a breakpoint within the AFIO region , but did not have a CALM or MLL rearrangement .
Translocations of 11423 are often associated with distal interstitial deletions that would make it difficult to detect the translocation by FISH .
However , our MLL probe , which encompasses approximately 1 mega-bp of 3 ' flanking sequences , was able to detect these kinds of translocations in previous studies . ``
'' Alternatively , another partner gene on chromosome 11 may be involved .
So far , MLL rearrangements have been shown to be a negative prognostic factor , especially in childhood ALL .
For AML , data are sparse and contradictory .
In a series of pediatric AML , patients with t ( 9 ; 11 ) ( p22 ; q23 ) had a better outcome , whereas Lo Coco et al `` identified MLL rearrangements as a negative prognostic factor in ALL and AML . ``
In infant AML , 11q23/MLL abnormalities had no effect on sur-vival . ``
'' In our study , all cases with t ( 10 ; 11 ) had a remarkably poor prognosis .
This holds up for the subpopulation of 7 AMLCGS86/92 patients whose event-free and overall survival was significantly worse than the survival data of the overall study group . ``
'' Therefore , our results suggest that cytogenetic/ molecular analysis may be used to identify this subgroup with poor prognosis .
In summary , we were able to identify a MLL or a CALM rearrangement , each in approximately half of the leukemias with a t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( p13 , q13-21 ) .
Moreover , MLL or CALM rearrangements were found in leukemias with different morphol-ogy .
MLL translocations were identified in leukemias with DREYLING ET AL monocytic morphology or maturation beyond the promyeloid stage , whereas CALM rearrangements were detectable in immature leukemias as well as ALL .
Further studies are necessary to characterize the biological characteristics of these molecular alterations .
Recently , Kobayashi et al* ' reported 4 cases of acute leukemia with CALM rearrangements that were studied by FISH .
However , the cases were not classified according to the FAB criteria .
