19968-19975 , 1994 Printed in U.S.A. A Novel Human Homeobox Gene Distantly Related to proboscipedia Is Expressed in Lymphoid and Pancreatic Tissues* ( Received for publication , March 17 , 1994 , and in revised form , May 20 , 1994 ) Kathleen A. Harrison , Kirk M. Druey , Yasuhiro Deguchi , Joseph M. Tuscano , and John H. Kehrl # From the Laboratory of Immunoregulation , NIAID , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 A novel human homeobox gene , HB9 , was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from in vitro stimulated human tonsil B lymphocytes and from a human genomic library .
The HB9 gene is composed of 3 exons spread over 6 kilobases of DNA .
An open reading frame of 1206 nucleotides is in frame with a diverged homeodomain .
The predicted HB9 protein has a molecular mass of 41 kilodaltons and is enriched for alanine , glycine , and leucine .
The HB9 homeodomain is most similar to that of the Drosophila melanogaster homeobox gene probosci-pedia .
Northern blot analysis of poly ( A ) RNA purified from the human B cell line RPMI 8226 and from activated T cells revealed a major mRNA transcript of 2.2 kilobases .
Similar analysis of poly ( A ) RNA from a variety of adult tissues demonstrated HB9 transcripts in pancreas , small intestine , and colon .
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine HB9 RNA transcripts in hematopoietic cell lines .
HB9 RNA transcripts were most prevalent in several human B cell lines and K562 cells .
In addition , transcripts were detected in RNA prepared from tonsil B cells and in situ hybridization studies localized them in the germinal center region of adult tonsil .
These findings suggest the involvement of HB9 in regulating gene transcription in lymphoid and pancreatic tissues .
Many of the genes important in Drosophila melanogaster embryonic development and body segmentation belong to a gene family with a characteristic 180-base pair nucleotide sequence termed a homeobox ( encodes a homeodomain ) ( 1 ) .
The carboxyl terminus of the homeodomain is related to the helix-turn-helix motif present in certain yeast and prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins ( 2-6 ) .
Homeodomain-containing proteins bind to DNA in a nucleotide sequence-specific manner and may either augment or repress transcription ( 7-12 ) .
These proteins are like genetic switches that embryonic cells use to choose among different developmental pathways .
Many of the known D. melanogaster homeobox genes are clustered in two gene complexes , the Bithorax complex ( BX-C ) and the Antennapedia complex ( ANT-C ) .
Surprisingly , the order of the genes within the complexes corresponds to their order of expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the D. melanogaster embryo ( 13 , 14 ) .

Homeobox genes are not only important in D. melanogaster development , but by virtue of their presence in other species including humans and on the basis of recent gene targeting experiments in mice , they have been implicated in the regulation of human embryonic development ( 15-19 ) .
A number of murine and human homeobox genes share remarkable similarity with D. melanogaster homeobox genes ( 20 , 21 ) .
Approximately 40 human homeobox genes are clustered in four genomic loci .
These loci termed HOXA , HOXB , HOXC , and HOXD are located on chromosomes 7 , 17 , 12 , and 2 , respectively .
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the homeodomains has allowed these genes to be clustered into 13 groups or paralogs .
Human HOX genes that belong to the same group occupy homologous positions in their respective loci .
Some of the HOX homeodomain groups can also be put into a one to one correspondence with members of the D. melanogaster ANT-C and BX-C ( 22-24 ) .
Besides their presumed role in development , several HOX family members have been implicated in the control of gene transcription in adult tissues .
For example , many of the HOX family members are expressed in hematopoietic cells and cell lines .
Differentiation of hematopoietic cells along specific cell lineages has been associated with alterations in expression levels of certain HOX family members ( reviewed in Refs .
25 and 26 ) .
In addition to the HOX genes , there are other homeobox genes whose chromosomal locations lie outside of the HOX loci .
Most of them encode for proteins with diverged homeodomains .
For example , the POU subfamily of homeobox genes have homeodomains that only share 30 % identity with the HOX family members ( 27 , 28 ) .
Interestingly , several members of this subfamily were identified on the basis of their activity as tissue-specific transcription factors in adult cells ( 29-31 ) .
One of them , Oct-2 , may be important for the B lymphoid-specific transcription of immunoglobulin genes ( 29 , 30 ) .
Oct-2 binding sites have been found in the promoters of other B lineage-specific genes , suggesting a role for it in their tissue-specific expression as well ( 32 ) .
We have attempted to isolate other homeobox genes that might be important in B lymphocyte function .
An adult human B cell cDNA library was screened using oligo-nucleotides derived from a conserved region of the homeobox .
A previously unknown human homeobox gene termed HBQ9 was discovered .
It is located on chromosome 1 , outside of the HOX loci , and it encodes a protein with a homeodomain that is 55-66 % identical to those of the HOX family ( 33 , 34 ) .
HB9 is shown to be well expressed in certain lymphoid cell lines , particularly B cell lines , and in the germinal center region of tonsil tissues , as well as in a limited number of other cell lines and tissues .
In addition , the complete coding sequence and genomic structure of HB9 has been completed .
MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA and Genomic Cloning-A degenerative oligonucleotide probe ( TGG TG ( TVC ) AAC ) ( C/A ) G ( G/C ) ( C/A ) G ( GC ) CA ( WG ) 19968 Expression of the Novel Homeobox Gene HB9 AA ( A/G ) GA ( A/G ) AA ) derived from a conserved region in the homeobox was used to screen a human B cell cDNA library in A ZAP phage ( 35 , 36 ) .
A human lymphocyte genomic library made in A DASH ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) was screened with the HB9 cDNA clone .
A 3.5-kb ' EcoRI fragment was subcloned into pBluescript .
A second genomic library made in A FIX II ( Stratagene ) was also screened using a PCR product from the 5 ' end of the cDNA ( bases 1-120 ) .
Two positive clones were isolated and a 4.0-kb BamHI fragment was subcloned into pBluescript .
The HB9 cDNA insert and subcloned inserts of the hybridizing genomic clones were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method ( 37 ) .
Either pBluescript KS or SK primers ( Stratagene ) or various internal primers derived from previous sequence information were used .
All oligonucle-otides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 381A DNA synthesizer ( Foster City , CA ) .
The DNA sequence from the HB9 cDNA and genomic clone inserts were compared with the GenBank Genetic Sequence Data Bank using the FASTA program ( NCI Supercomputing Center , Frederick , MD ) ( 38 ) .
In Vitro Transcription and Translation of HB9-A BstXI fragment of HB9 pBluescript was ligated to a Xmal-BstXI fragment from the HB9 BamHI genomic fragment that contains the 5 end of the coding sequence .
The XmaI-BsfXI fragment was inserted into the Xmal and sites in pBluescript .
The resulting plasmid , HB9C pBluescript , contains the complete coding region for the HB9 protein .
Capped RNA was synthesized in a 25-pul reaction using as a substrate 2 ug of linear-ized HB9C pBluescript DNA for 1 h at 40°C using T7 polymerase ( Stratagene ) in the presence of RNasin ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
In vitro translation of the RNA was done using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Stratagene ) in a 25-pl reaction with 10 % of the capped mRNA in the presence of [ *S ) methionine ( Amersham Corp. ) .
The translation products were separated on a 10-20 % SDS-PAGE gel and visualized via autoradiography .
Northern Blot Assay and RT-PCR-Normal B cells were isolated from human tonsils , and normal T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The tonsil B cells were purified by removing tonsillar T cells as previously described ( 39 ) .
The tonsil B cells were fractionated into various size fractions via elutriation .
Briefly , 250 million purified tonsil B cells were loaded into a Sanderson elutriation chamber of a J6-M elutriator ( Beckman , Palo Alto , CA ) at a constant speed of 3200 rpm with a flow rate of 10 ml/min .
The flow rate was incrementally increased from 10 ml/min to 23 , to 32 , to 38 , to 43 , and finally to 50 ml/min .
One hundred-ml fractions were collected at each flow rate .
Following collection of the 50 ml/min fraction , the centrifuge was stopped and the last fraction was collected .
Human hematopoietic cell lines were obtained from ATCC ( Rockville , MD ) with the exception of the MT-2 , BJA-B , BHM , and PB697 cell lines .
They were kind gifts of Drs .
Scott Koenig ( NIAID , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) , Edward Oates ( Miami , FL ) , Thomas Folks ( CDC , Atlanta , GA ) , Thomas Tedder ( Duke University , Durham , NC ) , respectively .
Total RNA was isolated from hematopoietic cells and tissues using a standard guanidine thiocyanate method ( 40 ) .
Poly ( A ) RNAs were isolated by oligo ( dT ) -cellulose columns using standard methods ( 41 ) .
The purified RNAs were electrophoresed on agarose formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon reinforced nitrocellulose filters ( Schleicher & Schuell ) .
The multiple tissue blots were purchased from Clontech ( Palo Alto , CA ) .
The size-fractionated RNA blots were hybridized using P-labeled HB9 cDNA insert , and washed under high stringency conditions ( 0.1 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS , 65 °C ) .
The RT-PCR assays were performed using standard methodology ( 42 ) .
Two micrograms of total RNA from various cell types were reverse transcribed at 42 °C for 1 h using oligo ( dT ) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
One-tenth of the cDNA was used for each PCR reaction .
Two units of Tag polymerase and 0.4 um each primer were used .
The following HB9 primers were used : the 5 primer 5'-TCCACCGCGGGCATGATCCTG-3 ' and the 3 `` primer 55-GCGCTTGGGCCGCGACAGCTA-3 ' , which generate a 165-bp fragment .
The following B-actin primers were used : the 5 primer 5-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3 ' and the 3 `` antisense primer 5'-CTAGAAGCATTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3 ' , which generate a 661-bp fragment .
The 3 ' primers were labeled with [ y-*°P ] ATP using polynucleotide kinase .
Twenty-nine cycles of PCR amplification were performed as follows .
The first cycle consisted of a 1-min denaturation step at 94 °C , a 45-s annealing step at 55 °C , and a -min extension step at 72 °C ; the remaining 28 cycles consisted of a 1-min denaturation step at 94 °C , a 45-s annealing step at 60 °C , and a l-min extension step at 72°C ; after the 29th cycle , a final 5-min ' The abbreviations used are : kb , kilobase ( s ) ; PCR , polymerase chain reaction ; RT-PCR , reverse transcriptase PCR ; PAGE , polymacrylamide gel electrophoresis ; bp , base pair ( s ) .
19969 extension step at 72 °C was performed .
The PCR products were analyzed by polyacrylamide electrophoresis and autoradiography .
In Situ Hybridization to Tissue Sections for HB9 Gene Expression-Paraffin-embedded tonsil sections , thymus , and spleen were mounted on silanized slides .
Fetal tissues were recovered following prosta-glandin/saline-induced therapeutic abortions after tissues were discarded by the pathologist .
Informed consent was obtained from all concerned parties according to the recommendations and rules of the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects from Research Risks at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital , the Human Investigation Committee at the Children 's Hospital , and the Helsinki Accord of 1971 .
Tissues were frozen in liquid N , immediately after recovery .
The ges-tational stage of the tissues was 17-20 weeks as determined by standard tables for development ( 43 ) .
The HB9 antisense RNA probe ( `` S-labeled transcripts of 1.2 kb with T7 promoter detecting the HB9 mRNA or the HB9 RNA sense probe ( same fragment with T3 promoter ) were made by standard methods .
The probes were hydrolyzed in a carbonate buffer to a length of approximately 300 base pairs .
Slides were prepared , prehybridized , hybridized , and washed as previously described ( 44 ) .
After a 4-day exposure in a 1:1 dilution of Kodak NTN-2 emulsion , the slides were developed in Kodak D-19 and Rapid Fix , and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa solution .
RESULTS Isolation of HB9 and Analysis of the Predicted Protein-A cDNA library was constructed with poly ( A ) RNA isolated from tonsil B cells ( 18-year-old ) stimulated in vitro for 24 h with the polyclonal B cell activator Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .
This library was screened with a degenerate oligonucleotide probe designed to hybridize to conserved DNA sequences from the D. melanogaster homeobox .
Seven hundred and fifty thousand eDNA clones were screened , and five positive clones were isolated .
Search of GenBank with a partial DNA sequence from each clone revealed that two of the clones were identical to HOXB7 , a known human homeobox gene ( 45 ) ; one of the other clones recognized a previously unknown human homeobox gene and was designated HB9 ; and the last two clones identified another novel homeobox gene that was termed HB24 and is now referred to as HLX ( 46 ) .
The HB9 cDNA clone ( 1254 nucleotides ) was fully sequenced , and an open reading frame was found that encoded a homeodomain ( 33 ) .
Multiple other human cDNA libraries ( prepared from RNA from KG-1 cells , HS-Sultan , fetal brain , and human bone marrow ) were screened , and no cDNA clones extending further 5 ' were identified .
In retrospect , this may have been secondary to the extremely high GC content of the 5 ' end of HB9 .
Because of these difficulties , genomic clones were isolated to complete the open reading frame .
A 8.5-kb EcoRI fragment that contained the homeobox was subcloned and sequenced ; however , it lacked the 5 end of the HB9 cDNA .
A 4.0-kb BamHI fragment hybridized with a PCR product from the 5 end of the cDNA and was subcloned into pBluescript .
This fragment was sequenced with specific primers based on the HB9 cDNA sequence .
The cDNA sequence was extended 493 bp until an in-frame ATG was discovered .
5 of the presumed ATG a stop codon in each of the three reading frames was noted .
Analysis of the 5 extension of the HB9 cDNA indicated that it contained amino acid coding sequence .
In addition , there were no consensus splice sites in the genomic sequence to suggest the presence of another 5 exon .
The composite sequence is approximately 2.0 kb , consistent with the size of the major HB9 mRNA transcript ( see below ) .
Both genomic fragments were sequenced and the overall structure and sequence of the HB9 gene is shown in Fig .
1 .
Only a portion of intron 1 was sequenced , and the distance between exon 1 and exon 2 was determined by PCR with primers based on known sequences in the intron .
The HB9 gene is spread over approximately 6 kb and is composed of 3 exons .
The 1st exon contains the translational start site and the bulk of the B9 coding sequence 5 of the homeobox .

The 3rd exon contains all the coding sequences 3 ' of the homeodomain .
Approximately 2.5 kb of sequence upstream of the presumed initiating ATG were sequenced ( data not shown ) .
The sequence of this region is consistent with a promoter although no TATA box was noted .
The putative promoter is very GC-rich and includes a CpG island , which extends approximately 800 base pairs 5 from the presumed translational start site .
The original HB9 cDNA did not contain a poly ( A ) tail , although the genomic sequence contains a polyadenylation signal 106 base pairs 3 ' of the end of the cDNA clone .
Confirmation that the composite sequence from the genomic and cDNA clones potentially encoded an open reading frame was provided by fusing a portion of the BamHI genomic clone with the HB9 cDNA clone using a unique BstXI restriction site common to both clones creating a new plasmid , HB9C pBluescript .
This plasmid was in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [ *SJmethionine , and an approximately 48-kDa product was visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography ( Fig .
2 ) .
Since this is larger than the predicted protein , the DNA sequence of the entire coding region was re-sequenced .
No errors that would shift the open reading frame were detected , leading to the conclusion that the HB9 protein runs aberrantly on SDS-PAGE , .
Finally , RT-PCR with primers from the genomic and the cDNA sequence amplified the appropriate size PCR product from B cell RNA ( data not shown ) .
The predicted HB9 protein ( Fig .
1 ) has a molecular mass of 41 kDa and is enriched for alanine ( 17 % ) , glycine ( 14 % ) , and proline ( 10 % ) .
It has several runs of identical amino acids including a stretch of 16 consecutive alanines ( amino acids 120-135 ) and a stretch of 8 glycines ( amino acids 99-104 ) .
A strongly acidic region ( amino acids 354-367 ) is present , containing 12 negatively charged amino acids out of 14 .
In addition , a number of phosphorylation sites are predicted to exist , including several casein kinase II sites and two protein kinase C sites .

Comparison of the HB9 with Previously Isolated Homeodomain-containing Proteins-The homeodomain region of HB9 is highly homologous to a consensus sequence for homeodomain-containing proteins ( 19/21 amino acids ) .
The most conserved portion of the homeodomain ( amino acid residues 42-50 in Fig .
3 ) spans the second helix in the helix-turn helix motif and has been implicated in DNA binding ( 2 , 3 ) .
When the HB9 homeodomain was compared to homeodomains from known D. melanogaster homeobox genes and human HOX family genes , it was found to be only moderately conserved ( Fig .
3 ) .
The most homologous D. melanogaster homeodomain is that of proboscipedia ( pb ) ( 47 ) .
Among the human HOX family members HB9 is most homologous to HOXB2 , the human equivalent of the pb gene ( Fig .
3 ) ( 22 , 24 ) .
Outside the homeodomain HB9 is not significantly homologous with other known homeodomain-containing proteins .
HB9 also lacks the conserved pentapeptide IYPWM found upstream of the homeodomain of most of the members of the D. melanogaster Antennapedia complex and of the HOX families ; however , there is the pentapeptide ILPKM in a similar location ( 12 , 48 , 49 ) .
Analysis of HB9 mRNA Expression-Northern blot analysis of 5 ug of poly ( A ) RNA purified from a mature human B cell line , RPMI 8226 , and from in vitro activated normal human T cells revealed a major HB9 mRNA transcript of 2.3 kb ( Fig .
4 ) ; a minor transcript of 6.0 kb was noted on longer exposures ( data not shown ) .
The larger HB9 transcript may represent unspliced mRNAs .
The Northern blot containing activated T cells was exposed for 7 days , while the Northern blot of RPMI 8226 RNA was exposed overnight .
Northern blot analysis of 2 ug of poly ( A ) RNA from 16 different tissues revealed moderate expression in pancreas and low expression in small intestine and colon ( Fig .
5 ) .
Both the major 2.3-kb and the minor 6.0-kb HB9 transcripts were detected , similar to that observed with the B and T cell RNAs ; however , an additional transcript of approximately 3.5 kb was noted in the RNA prepared from the pancreas .
The multiple tissue blots were re-probed with a CD20 cDNA to determine the relative abundance of B cells in the 19971 various tissues ( 50 ) .
High levels of CD20 gene expression were detected in RNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen , while low levels were found in thymus and small intestine .
Colon mRNA had detectable levels of CD20 transcripts on a 3-day exposure ( data not shown ) .
Based on the amount of HB9 versus CD20 signal , it is likely that the HB9 transcripts in pancreas , small intestine , and colon are unrelated to the presence of B cells .
Thus , despite the presence of HB9 transcripts in poly ( A ) RNA isolated from a human B cell line and activated normal T cells , no detectable HB9 transcripts were observed in poly ( A ) RNA prepared from thymus , spleen , or peripheral blood leukocytes .
This would imply one of several possibilities : that HB9 transcripts are expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes , spleen , or thymus but only at very low levels below the sensitivity of the Northern blot ; that they are present in a small subset of the cells from which the poly ( A ) RNA was prepared , making it difficult to detect the transcripts ; or that they are not normally present in thymus , peripheral blood leukocytes , and spleen and can only be found in transformed cell lines or under conditions of strong in vitro activation .
These various possibilities were examined using RT-PCR to detect HB9 RNA in various cell lines and normal B and T cells , and via in situ hybridization to examine expression in tissues HB9 mRNA expression was readily detected via RT-PCR .
Two micrograms of total RNA from each cell line were reverse transcribed and one-tenth of the cDNA used for PCR with primers for B-actin or for HB9 .
HB9 was best expressed in several B cell lines , including most of the Burkitt cell lines examined ( Fig .
6A ) , and in K562 cells , an erythroleukemia cell line ( data not shown ) .
Not all of the B cell lines expressed HB9 as several lymphoblastoid cell lines were essentially negative ( data not shown ) .
In addition , the pre-B cell line PB-697 lacked transcripts ( Fig .
6A ) .
Low levels of HB9 were detected in Jurkat cells , an immature CD4-positive T cell line , and in MT-2 cells , an HTLV I-trans-formed T cell line .
In the primary T and B cells isolated from peripheral blood and tonsil , respectively , very low levels of HB9 were detected ( data not shown ) .
However , when tonsil B cells were size-fractionated via elutriation , the fraction of B cells containing the largest cells had a significant HB9 signal ( Fig .
6B ) .
HB9 mRNA was detected in adult tonsil tissue via in situ hybridization .
Within the tonsil , the signal was present in the germinal center region and excluded from the mantle zone ( Fig .
7a ) .
Outside of the mantle zone silver grains were also de-tected .
The nature of the cells is unknown .
Low levels of HB9 signal were also detected in the spleen ( Fig .
7c ) .
Based on this analysis , the lack of HB9 transcripts on Northern blot analysis of spleen and peripheral blood leukocyte poly ( A ) RNAs is probably secondary to HB9 expression in a small subset of cells .
In situ hybridization with thymus from an 8-year-old child demonstrated HB9 transcripts in the medullary region ( Fig .
76 ) , again suggesting that the failure to detect HB9 transcripts on Northern blot analysis of thymus poly ( A ) RNA was secondary to a low signal in a small percentage of the cells .
A strong HB9 signal was detected in a subset of bone marrow cells ( Fig .
7d ) and in fetal liver ( Fig .
Te ) .
Hybridization with a sense probe to thymic tissue is shown in Fig .

In situ hybridization to examine HB9 mRNA expression in a limited number of developing human tissues ( 16-20 weeks ) revealed no hybridization signal in lung , heart , stomach , large vessel , or adrenal gland .
A clear signal was present in developing brain and developing testis .

The T cells were purified from peripheral blood and stimulated with phytohemagglutinin ( 1 ug/ml ) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( 10 ng/ml ) for 24 h. Positions of 18 and 28 S rRNA transcripts are marked .

marrow cells , and several tissues from the gastrointestinal tract .
When the HB9 homeodomain was compared to known human and murine homeodomains , it was found to be only moderately conserved , intermediate between the prototypic human HOX families and the highly diverged homeodomain-containing proteins such as Oct-2 .
The most similar known homeodomain was that of the D. melanogaster homeobox gene pb and its human equivalent HOXB2 .
Within the HB9 homeodomain , the second helix in the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif ( residues 42-50 ) is identical to the standard D. melanogaster homeodomains in this region , with the exception of a threonine at amino acid 43 .
This is a non-conservative change , since an arginine is usually present there ( 2 , 3 ) .
Two D. melanogaster homeodomain-containing pro-teins , Rough and Lab also have a threonine at position 43 ( 51 ) .

Analysis of poly ( A ) RNA from various tissues .
Two micrograms of poly ( A ) RNA from various tissues were size-fractionated , transferred and the blot probed with HB9 cDNA ( above ) stripped and re-hybridized with a CD20 cDNA ( below ) .
The origins of the various RNAs are indicated below .
RNA size markers are indicated on the left .
The HB9 autoradiograph was exposed for 3 days , while the CD20 blot was exposed overnight .
the homeodomain , the HB9 protein shares the conserved argi-nine , alanine , and leucine residues ; however , there are several relatively unique residues in this region , including the phen-ylalanine at residue 32 and the threonine residues at position 36 .
Outside of the homeodomain , the predicted HB9 protein is highly charged with both strongly acidic ( amino acids 354-367 ) and basic ( amino acids 293-302 ) regions .
The highly acidic region may be involved in transcriptional activation or repres-sion .
The long run of alanines is a relatively unique feature of HB9 , as this has been found in only a few other proteins .
The D. melanogaster engrailed ( en ) protein has a long stretch of alanines also located on the amino-terminal side of its homeodomain .
The en protein contributes to segmental patterning , and in transfection assays it acts as a transcriptional repressor ( 52 ) .
Analysis of mutant en proteins mapped the repressor activity to a region that contains the stretch of contiguous alanines ( 53 ) , thus raising the possibility that HB9 functions as a transcriptional repressor as well .
Identification of potential DNA target sequences for HB9 is in progress , and once a consensus target sequence is determined we can directly test whether HB9 is a transcriptional repressor in vitro .

Analysis of HB9 mRNA expression in various hematopoietic cell types by RT-PCR .
A , 2 ug of total RNA from the indicated cell lines were reverse transcribed , and one-tenth of the cDNA subjected to PCR with HB9 or B-actin primers in which the 3 ' primer was *°P-labeled .
The PCR products were analyzed by PAGE and autoradio-graphed .
The B-actin autoradiograph was exposed for 1 h and HB9 for 4 h. B , 2 ug of RNA purified from various tonsillar B cell fractions were reverse transcribed and one-tenth of the cDNA subjected to RT-PCR for HB9 or B-actin .
Tonsil B cells were fractionated via elutriation .
The smallest cells ( lower fractions ) have a phenotype of mantle zone B cells , while the largest cells ( highest fractions ) have a phenotype of germinal center B cells .
Exposure times were as in panel A .
An interesting feature of the genomic structure of HB9 is the presence of an intron that interrupts the homeodomain coding sequence between amino acids 44 and 45 .
Similarly the homeobox gene pb and the adjacent homeobox gene in the D. melanogaster Ant-C labial ( lab ) have an intron in the same location .
This intron was first discovered in the lab gene and is known as a lab-class intron ( 47 , 54 ) .
It defines an extended gene family , which , in addition to pb and lab , includes NK-1 , a Drosophila gene of unknown function ; Distal-less , a gene required for proximal distal axis formation in Drosophila ( 55 ) ; and ceh-13 , a Caenorhabditis elegans gene that is an apparent lab homologue ( 56 ) .
The human pb homologue HOXB2 lacks this intron , suggesting that some genes which probably once had this intron have lost it ( 23 ) .
The human HLX gene is located near HB9 on the q41 band of chromosome 1 , and like HB9 it has a lab class intron . ``
HB9 and HLX similar to other genes with this intron have the protein sequence QVK conserved at the point of the intron .
Homeobox genes that have this intron appear to be quite ancient based on their presence in widely diverse species , and both lab and pb have been proposed to be members of a small contingent of homeobox genes that evolutionarily preceded the expansion of the Antp class of genes ( 47 ) .
The expression of HB9 in B lymphoid cell lines and in primary B cells from human tonsils prompted an investigation of HB9 expression in tonsil tissue .
Tonsils are the site of active B cell stimulation , as witnessed by the large number of germinal centers present in them .
Germinal centers arise from the immune response to T cell-dependent antigens and are the site of a number of important physiologic processes ( reviewed in Ref .
* K. Harrison and J. Kehrl , unpublished observation .
19973 57 ) .
They contain large numbers of rapidly proliferating B cells ; they are where immunoglobulin genes undergo somatic muta-tions , resulting in the generation of B cells with immunoglobulin receptors that have altered affinities for antigen ; they are where B cells undergo class switching ; and they are where B cells are selected to differentiate into memory B or plasma cells or , alternatively , to die in situ .
In contrast , the surrounding mantle zone region of the germinal center contains quiescent B cells .
The HB9 gene localized in the germinal center region and was not detected in the mantle region .
When tonsil B cells were size-fractionated , the highest HB9 signal was found in the largest cells , which is consistent with preferential expression of HB9 in germinal center versus non-germinal center B cells .
The largest fraction of elutriated cells are IgD~ , CD44 low , CD38 high , and CD39 low consistent with a germinal center pheno-type .
The function of HB9 in germinal center B cells remains to be defined , but its preferential expression in these cells implicates it in one of the unique processes occurring there .
A high level of HB9 expression has also been found in a subpopulation of adult bone marrow cells .
Approximately 5 % of the cells from human bone marrow strongly hybridized with an anti-sense HB9 RNA .
Since the number of HB9-positive cells is similar to the number of CD34-positive cells known to be present in the bone marrow , the expression of HB9 in CD34-positive cells has been examined .
CD34 monoclonal antibodies identify approximately 3 % of normal bone marrow cells , and this subset contains the hematopoietic progenitor cells ( 58 , 59 ) .
When human bone marrow cells were separated into CD34-enriched and -depleted fractions , HB9 transcripts were present exclusively in the CD34-positive , but not in the CD34-depleted , fraction .
In addition , HB9 was found to be expressed in acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias , presumably because of the immaturity of the leukemic cells ( 61 ) .
This result has been confirmed by in situ hybridization using purified CD34-positive cells ( 60 ) .
Thus , HB9 is present in hematopoietic cell lines , as well as an important subset of normal bone marrow cells .
In addition to lymphoid tissue and CD34-positive bone marrow cells , the HB9 gene was also found to be expressed in relative abundance in the pancreas and lower amount in the small intestine and colon .
The presence of HB9 mRNA in pancreatic tissue is not likely to be secondary to the presence of B cells within the pancreas , since CD20 mRNA was not detected on Northern blot analysis of RNA prepared from pancreatic tissue .
While the importance of HB9 transcripts within the pancreas is unknown , another homeobox gene has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression in the endocrine portion of the pancreas .
A homeobox gene termed either IPF1 ( insulin promoter factor ) or STF-1 ( somatostatin transactivat-ing factor ) was independently isolated from cDNA libraries prepared from BTC1 cells ( a transgenically derived insulin-producing B-cell line ) and from Tu-6 cells ( a pancreatic islet cell line ) , respectively ( 62 , 63 ) .
IPF1/STF-1 binds to and transactivates both the insulin promoter and the somatostatin promoter .
However , when IPF1/STF-1 expression was co-localized with specific islet hormone-producing cells , IPF1/STF-1 was found in insulin-producing but not glucagon- or stomatostatin-produc-ing cells , raising questions about its role in in vivo stomatosta-tin gene regulation ( 62 ) .
A Xenopus homeobox gene XIHbox8 , highly related to IPF1/STF-1 , is also expressed in the adult Xenopus pancreas , but only in the nuclei of the pancreatic excretory ducts , not in the pancreatic endocrine cells ( 64 , 65 ) .
A murine counterpart of the Xlhbox8 gene or , conversely , a Xenopus counterpart of IPF1/STF-1 have not been reported , and the precise relationship between these two genes remains to be elucidated .
Both IPF1/STF-1 and the XIHbox8 have a unique histidine at position 44 of the homeodomain ; in contrast , HB9 19974 Expression of the Novel Homeobox Gene HB9 a aB 3 ' Xo ; Fic .
