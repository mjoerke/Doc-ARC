POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REGULATION OF IL-2 GENE EXPRESSION : ROLE OF MULTN E REGULATORY SITES Liqian Zhang and Gary J. Nabel Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) is an important lymphokine required in the process of T cell activation , proliferation , clonal expansion and differentiation .
The IL-2 gene displays both T cell specific and inducible expression : it is only expressed in CD4* T cells after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation .
Several cis-acting regulatory sites are required for induction of the IL-2 gene after stimulation .
In this study , we have analysed the function of these cis-acting regulatory sites in the context of the native IL-2 enhancer and promoter sequence .
The results of this study suggest that the NFAT ( -276 to -261 ) , the distal octamer ( -256 to -248 ) and the proximal octamer ( -75 to -66 ) sites not only act as enhancers of IL-2 gene transcription in the presence of cellular stimulation , but also have a silencing effect on IL-2 gene expression in resting cells .
Two other sites display disparate effects on IL-2 gene expression in different T leukemia cell lines : the distal purine box ( -291 to -277 ) and the proximal purine box sites ( -145 to -128 ) .
Finally , the AP-1 ( -186 to -176 ) and the « B sites ( -206 to -195 ) respond to different cellular activation in EL4 cells .
The AP-1 site mediated the response to PMA stimulation while the « B site responded to IL-1 stimulation .
These data suggest that the regulation of IL-2 gene expression is a complex process and multiple cis-acting regulatory sites interact to exert different effects in T cells representative of alternative stages of differentiation .
Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) is a 15 kDa glycoprotein `` produced by CD4* T lymphocytes after mitogenic or antigenic stimulation .
Expression of the IL-2 gene is crucial to the function of the immune system .
Binding of IL-2 to its receptor ( IL-2r ) on the cell surface is required for antigen-specific proliferation and differentiation of T cells , growth and differentiation of activated B cells into antibody-secreting cells , and activation of cytotoxicity by cytotoxic T cell clones .
`` ~* Expression of the IL-2 gene is restricted to activated T cells .
Previous studies have shown that the regulatory sequence for the IL-2 gene lie at the 5 ' end of the gene , the region from -326 to -52 ( with respect to the transcription initiation site ) is sufficient to activate transfected IL-2 reporter plasmids in mitogen induced From the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , University of Michigan Medical Center , Departments of Internal Medicine and Biological Chemistry , 1150 West Medical Center Drive , 4510 MSRB I , Ann Arbor , MI 48109-0650 , USA .

`` `` ° DNA footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) revealed that there are specific DNA-protein interactions at the NFAT site ( -285 to -255 ) , the proximal octamer site ( -83 to -66 ) , distal octamer sites ( -256 to -248 ) , and the distal purine box site ( -291 to -271 ) .
'~ `` `` A « B site ( -206 to -195 ) and an AP-1 site ( -186 to -176 ) were also identified by sequence homology to the known consensus sequences .
Figure 1 gives a simple representation of these sites and their location .
In most of these studies , the functions of these cis-regulatory sites were determined through deletion experiments or by linking multiple copies of the site of interest to a heterologous promoter or enhancer .
Although this kind of approach is simple and straight-forward , the site is examined out of its native context , and the interpretation of these results may not reflect the true function of the regulatory site .
To elucidate the functions of cis-acting regulatory sites in the IL-2 enhancer region , each site has been mutated in its surrounding sequences in the present study .
After transfecting these mutants into either Jurkat or EL4 cells , the basal or stimulated CAT activities are compared with those of native IL2-CAT plasmid to determine the role of each site in either the inhibition of the IL-2 gene expression in resting T cells 221 222 / Zhang and Nabel CYTOKINE , Vol .

Each box represents a cis-acting regulatory site with the position relative to transcriptional initiation site underneath it .
or the response to different extracellular stimulation signals .
Unlike previous studies that used deletion plasmids or tandem copies of a single site , the present work uses site-directed mutagenesis to maximally preserve the DNA-protein or protein-protein interac-tion , making interpretation of each site 's functions closest to its native ones .
The results we report here show that all seven regulatory sites studied appear to be of some importance in the activation of the IL-2 gene in response to extracellular stimulation .
The NFAT site , the proximal octamer site and the distal octamer site have a silencing effect on IL-2 transcription in untreated cells , and also act as enhancers of IL-2 gene transcription in the presence of stimulation .
The proximal and distal purine box sites show different functions in different T cell lines , and the « B site and the AP-1 site respond to IL-1 or PMA stimulation , respectively .
These results demonstrate that the regulation of the IL-2 gene is a complex process , involving the responses of multiple regulatory sites to different membrane signals .
RESULTS Proximal Octamer , Distant Octamer and NFAT Sites By sequence comparison to the octamer site in the Ig enhancer , two octamer sites had been identified in the IL-2 enhancer region ; the proximal one ( -75 to -66 ) has the same orientation as the octamer site in the Ig enhancer while the distal site ( -256 to -248 ) is in the reverse orientation .
Previous studies have shown specific protein-DNA interactions between the nuclear proteins from Jurkat cells and oligonucleotides containing either the proximal octamer or the distal octamer sequence , and one of the components in this protein complex is the ubiquitous transcription factor , Also , these studies have shown that the proximal octamer site is a negative regulatory site and the distal octamer site is a positive regulatory site .
To investigate further the functions of the two octamer sites of the IL-2 enhancer in their native DNA sequence context , single or double octamer site mutants were made by site-directed mutagenesis and their transient expression studied in either Jurkat or ELA cells .
The basal and stimulated CAT activities of these mutants were compared to those of the native IL2-CAT plasmid .
Similar results were obtained from both cell lines .
CAT activity of each single mutant decreased 23 % to 88 % after cellular stimulation ( Fig .
2 ) , verifying that both octamer sites contribute to the positive regulation of IL-2 gene expression .
In contrast , the basal activities of either of the single octamer site mutants increased by 6.6- to 16-fold ( Fig .
2 ) , indicating that both octamer sites are also important in the negative regulation of the IL-2 gene in resting cells .
Additionally , when both octamer sites were mutated , the response to extracellular stimulation completely disappeared while the basal activity increased by 2.5- to 27.5-fold , further demonstrating the importance of both octamer sites in the negative and positive regulation of IL-2 gene expression .
These data indicated that both the proximal and distal octamer sites contribute individually to the negative regulation of IL-2 promoter in resting cells , as well as the positive regulation of IL-2 gene in response to cellular stimulation .
Mutation of both sites destroyed the inducible function entirely .
The NFAT site ( -289 to -263 ) has been shown to interact with a T cell-specific factor NFAT-1 ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) and confer T cell-specific , inducible and enhanced expression upon the A Plasmid aoct.pa [ H _ NR H _ Stimulation Regulatory site function of the IL-2 enhancer / 223 Percent conversion 0 10 20 830 40 50 60 Figure 2 .

Jurkat ( A ) or ELA ( B ) cells were transfected with wild type plasmid ( IL2-CAT ) , the single octamer site mutants ( A Oct.p , or A Oct.d ) , or the double octamer site mutant ( A Oct.p/d ) in the absence ( - ) or presence ( + ) of stimulation .
Cell treatment and CAT activity determination were performed as described in Materials and Methods .
Each bar represents a cis-acting regulatory site in the order as indicated in Fig .
1. normally uninduced fibrinogen promoter.© To determine the normal function of the NFAT site on the IL-2 promoter , a -277 to -261 mutant IL2-CAT-A NFAT was used in transfection experiments .
Similar results to those of the double octamer site mutant were obtained in both Jurkat and EL4 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
The stimulated CAT activity in response to ionomycin and/or PMA stimulation completely disappeared , whereas the basal activity increased 5.3- to 6.2-fold .
These data indicate that the NFAT site is also responsible for the low level of transcription from the promoter in unstimulated cells in addition to positive regulation after stimulation .
Purine Box Elements The distal ( -291 to -277 ) and proximal ( -145 to -128 ) purine box sites were identified through their high purine content .
Both purine box sites contain a consensus sequence for the Ets DNA binding site , AGGAA .
A novel Ets family member , Elf-1 , binds to both purine box sequences .
The distal purine box is also the 5 `` part of the DNase I protection sequence of NFAT .
!
In Jurkat cells , mutation of the proximal purine box does not significantly alter expression compared to wild type IL2-CAT in the presence and absence of stimulation ( Fig .
4A ) , suggesting that this site is not important in the aspects of IL-2 gene regulation studied here .
In contrast , the proximal purine box mutant showed a decrease in both the basal and the stimulated CAT activities in ELA cells ( Fig .
4B ) , demonstrating the involvement of the proximal purine box site in the positive regulation of the IL-2 gene .
The difference here may lie in the T cell lines , since Jurkat cells require two signals for the IL-2 gene induction , while EL4 cells require only one signal . ``
In the case of distal purine box mutant , the response of the mutant to extracellular stimulation is decreased in both Jurkat and EL4 cells ( Fig .
4 ) , showing that the distal purine box site is required for optimal activation of the IL-2 gene .
However , the basal activity of the distal purine box mutant is increased in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
4A ) , while decreased in ELA cells ( Fig .
4B ) .

_ Again , the difference may be explained by the different factors ( possibly species-specific ) in each cell lines .
IL-2 kB and AP-1 Sites By sequence comparison with the k light chain enhancer of immunoglobulins , the IL-2 receptor a-chain promoter , and the HIV-1 LTR , a « B site ( -206 to -195 ) within the IL-2 enhancer was identified .
This xB site has been shown to form specific DNA-protein complexes with mitogen induced Jurkat nuclear extracts and is required for optimal mitogen-induced activation of IL-2 in both Jurkat cells and in nontransformed T cell clones .
`` *~ `` `` In contrast to these results , expression of the kB site mutant IL2-CAT-A kB was not significantly different from the wild type construct in the absence or presence of PMA in ELA cells ( Fig .
5B ) .
In activated Jurkat cells , although the absolute CAT activity of the kB site mutant to ionomycin and PMA stimu- lation showed no difference to that of the IL-2-CAT plasmid , the induction of ionomycin and PMA de-creased , since the basal activity increased 24.5-fold over IL2-CAT ( Fig .
5A ) .
Thus the « B site 's function is minimal in EL4 cells following PMA treatment ; however , the kB site appears to contribute more to the negative control than to the mitogenic induction of IL-2 expression in Jurkat cells .
The EL4 cell line used in this study expresses IL-1 receptors at the cell membrane and IL-2 production can be induced by a combination of IL-1 and ionomycin treatment ( data not shown ) .
In response to IL-1 and ionomycin stimulation , the kB site mutant showed a decreased CAT activity while an AP-1 site mutant showed no difference ( Fig .
6 ) , indicating the involvement of the kB site in the IL-1 pathway .
The IL-2 enhancer contains an AP-1 site ( -186 to -176 ) by sequence comparison .
This site is specifically recognized by purified AP-1 , and confers IL-1 responsiveness on the IL-2 promoter in the mouse T cell line LBRM . ``

1. stimulation in EL4 cells was observed through the AP-1 site in our studies ( Fig .
6 ) .
In both Jurkat and ELA cell lines , both an increase in the basal CAT activity of the AP-1 site mutant and a decrease in mitogen stimulated CAT activity were observed , although the extent of the decrease was not very large ( Fig .
5 ) .
These data indicate that AP-1 site is a regulatory site in the IL-2 promoter but its effect is not as significant as the NFAT site or the octamet sites .
DISCUSSION In this study , the function of the cis-acting regulatory sites in the IL-2 gene expression were elucidated by systematic mutation of these sites and testing their response to extracellular stimulation .
Since the native IL-2 enhancer is relatively weak , almost all previous studies on IL-2 gene regulation had used a heterologous enhancer or promoter .
Although the use of heterologous enhancer may elevate the signal level , it can also interfere with the action of the regulatory sites , making interpretation of the data difficult .
This study used the native IL-2 enhancer and promoter to preserve maximally the interactions that occur at each site and between the DNA and protein ( s ) .
Using this approach , we have found that the NFAT site , and the proximal and distal octamer sites were involved in the suppression of IL-2 gene expression in resting T cells , as well as the induction of IL-2 gene expression after mitogenic stimulation .
Though the activity of wild type IL2-CAT plasmid in Jurkat cells is very low , the activity of the NFAT and each of the octamer mutant sites in resting cells is considerably above background level , highly repro-ducible , and therefore not likely due to variations in background of the CAT assay .
Our results are consistent with previous findings that have shown the proximal octamer site negatively regulates IL-2 gene expression in resting T cells when linked to a heterologous enhancer ; ° however , in the same study , no positive function was found for the proximal octamer site , probably because a strong SV40 enhancer has overcome the deficit of the octamer mu-tation .
A subsequent study , however , suggested a positive role for this element in the native enhancer ' `` in mitogen-stimulated cells , also consistent with the findings presented here .
The NFAT site is crucial for the induction of IL-2 gene expression , since mutation of the NFAT site completely abolished the response to stimulation .
Each of the two octamer sites contributes to both negative and positive regulation of the IL-2 gene expression , yet full induction of the IL-2 gene is achieved only with the presence of both octamer sites .
These observations suggest that a single site can confer two different functions depending on the state of cellular activation .
The changes in function of these regulatory sites may be due to changes in the protein complexes bound to these sites in response to stimulation .
Although no difference was detected from specific DNA-protein binding at either the proximal or distal octamer sites before or after stimulation , `` `` it remains possible that these protein complexes are modified post-translationally after stimulation .
Even though the mobility of the complexes did not change , such modification ( e.g .
phosphorylation ) may alter their function , resulting in repression before stimulation or induction after stimulation .
Another explanation may involve a recently described inducible protein , OAP ( Oct-1 associated protein ) , which binds 5 ' to the proximal octamer site . ``
'' It is likely that octamer binding with the ubiquitous transcription fac- tor , Oct-1 , in resting cells is inhibitory to IL-2 tran-scription ; after stimulation , the interaction of OAP alters the function of the octamer binding complexes .
The appearance of NFAT-1 after T cell activation `` * correlates well with the induction of IL-2 gene through the NFAT site .
Although no DNA-protein interactions were observed at the NFAT site in unstimulated cells , it is possible that in vitro DNA-protein binding may not reflect the in vivo interaction .
We hypothesize that a low affinity DNA-protein interaction may occur at the NFAT site in unstimulated cells , which might contribute to the basal repression observed through this site .
The distal purine box site is also involved in the negative and positive regulation of the IL-2 gene .
This purine box site is located just upstream of the NFAT site , and is seen as part of the DNA footprint of IL-2E . ``
' The effect of the proximal purine box site alone is minor and differs between the two T cell lines tested .
This may be because the factors needed for interactions with one of the two purine box sites are not present or not functional in one of the T cell lines , since the two T cell lines are representative of different stages of T cell maturation and require different stimuli to activate the IL-2 gene .
Therefore , the regulation of IL-2 gene expression may be different at various stages of development .
The « kB site is involved in the inducible expression of a large number of genes in different cell types .
`` `` ~* > The « kB site in the IL-2 enhancer was initially defined through DNase I footprinting at this region with stimulated Jurkat cell nuclear extract , `` but deletion analysis failed to detect any function in this site . ``
Other studies have shown that the « B site is important for IL-2 gene activation after mitogenic simu-lation .
'* ' > > `` * `` `` Our results indicate that in Jurkat cells , the main function of the kB site is to keep the IL-2 gene silent in the absence of any stimulation .
It is possible that this negative regulatory effect is conferred through NF-kB p50 homodimers since a previous study showed that the IL-2 gene expression parallels the decrease in the binding of NF-kB p50 homodimer to the « B site . ``
'' In ELA cells , the kB site is not important in response to PMA stimulation , but is important in conferring the IL-1 responsiveness .
It is therefore possible that redundancy of the enhancer , from the NFAT and/or other regulatory sites , can overcome the requirement for kB in ELA cells in response to mitogen stimulation .
In contrast , the AP-1 site responded to PMA to some extent in Jurkat and ELA cells .
This result is consistent with previous findings that the AP-1 site has only weak activity in Jurkat cells . ``
Contrary to previous reports that the AP-1 site is critical for the IL-1 pathway in LBRM cells , `` `` our results showed that this AP-1 site does not respond to IL-1 stimulation in ELA cells ; the IL-1 responsiveness Regulatory site function of the IL-2 enhancer / 227 is conferred by the xB site .
The difference may be due to the different factor ( s ) presented in these two cell lines .
Another AP-1 site ( -151 to -145 ) may also confer IL-1 responsiveness in EL4 cells , since this region of the mouse IL-2 enhancer is protected by an AP-1 like factor from EL4 cell extract in DNase I footprint experiment . ``
In summary , our study indicates that all of the seven IL-2 regulatory sites studied participate to some extent in the activation of the IL-2 gene in response to extracellular stimulation .
The NFAT , the distal and the proximal octamer sites having a silencing effect on IL-2 transcription in resting cells .
After stimulation , however , these three sites all act positively to induce IL-2 gene expression .
The distal and proximal purine box sites display different functions in the two T cell lines studied , Jurkat and EL4 .
For the « B and the AP-1 sites , these two sites are found to respond to IL-1 and PMA stimulation , respectively .
These findings contribute to an understanding of the regulation of the IL-2 gene expression in different T cell subsets and during T cell progressive stages of development .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid Construction The IL2-CAT plasmid was made by inserting an Rsa I fragment from the IL-2 enhancer ( -585 to +18 , digested by Bal 31 to eliminate the translation initiation site ) into the pUC-CAT plasmid .
All the mutants were made using the site directed mutagenesis technique* `` and the sequence of the mutated regions were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing .
The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the construction of the mutants are : proximal octamer site , 5-GTGTA-ATATGTCTCGAGTTTTGCACC-3 ' ; distal octamer site , 5'-CATACAGAAGGCGCAGCGGATCCGAATTAGA-GCTA-3 ' ; NFAT site , 5-A-AGGAGGAAAAATGTGC-AGTCTGCAGCGGCGTTAATTGC-3 ' ; proximal purine box site , 5-GTCATCAGGGTCCTGCGTATGAAGG-TAA-3 ' ; distal purine box site , 5-CCTTAAAGAA-GATCTTCGTCACTGTTTCAT-3 ' ; kB site , 5-GTAA-CAAAGATTCTAGAT-CGATACATCCATTC-3 ' ; AP-site , 5-CTACATCCATTCGAAGCTTCTTTGGGGG-3 ' .
Cell Culture and Transfection Jurkat and EL4 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media ( GIBCO ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 U/ml streptomycin .
b-mercaptoethanol , 50 mM , was also included in the media for EL4 cells .
DNA transfection experiments were performed by the DEAE-dextran method as previously de-scribed . ``
Protein concentrations were determined and normalized during the CAT assay .
With these conditions , co-transfection experiments using RSV-luciferase plasmid have shown that there is no significant variation among 228 / Zhang and Nabel transfection efficiency in a single experiment ( Zhang and Nabel , unpublished ) .
Plasmid , 10 ug , was used to transfect 10 ' cells .
After the transfection , cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media with 5 % fetal bovine serum .
Jurkat cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of PMA and 1.4 ug/ml of ionomycin for 20 h , and EL4 cells were treated with either 10 ng/ ml of PMA for 12 h , or 1.4 pg/ml of ionomycin and 15 U/ml IL-1 for 16 h. Cells were harvested 44 h after transfection , and extracts were made after three rounds of freeze-thaw in ethanol/dry ice bath .
The protein content of each extract was quantitated by Bradford assay and an equal amount of protein from each extract was used for CAT assay .
Though the conversion of wild type IL2-CAT plasmid in Jurkat cells is near the limits of the linear range of the CAT assay , it nonetheless shows the difference in CAT activity among different protein extracts .
The results shown from one experiment are representative of at least three independent replicates .
