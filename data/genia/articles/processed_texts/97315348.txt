12 © 1997 Oxford University Press The class II trans-activator CIITA interacts with the TBP-associated factor TAF , ,32 Joseph D. Fontes , Bing Jiang and B. Matija Peterlin* Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Departments of Medicine , Microbiology and Immunology , University of California at San Francisco , San Francisco , CA 94143-0724 , USA Received December 11 , 1996 ; Revised and Accepted April 24 , 1997 ABSTRACT The class II trans-activator ( CIITA ) is the main transcriptional co-activator for the expression of MHC class II proteins .
Its N-terminal 125 amino acids function as an independent transcriptional activation domain .
Analyses of the primary amino acid sequence of the activation domain predict the presence of three o-helices , each with a high proportion of acidic residues .
Using site-directed mutagenesis , we found that two of these predicted o-helices are required for full transcriptional activation by CIITA .
Moreover , a CIITA protein in which both functional a-helices have been deleted displays a dominant negative phenotype .
This activation domain of CIITA interacts with the 32 kDa subunit of the general transcription complex TFIID , TAF,32 .
Decreased transcriptional activation by N-terminal deletions of CIITA is correlated directly with their reduced binding to TAF , 32 .
We conclude that interactions between TAF , 32 and CIITA are responsible for activation of class II genes .
INTRODUCTION Cell type-specific and IFNy-inducible expression of genes in the class II major histocompatibility complex ( class II ) is required for normal function of the immune system .
Congenital lack of class II determinants results in the severe combined immunodeficiency known as type II bare lymphocyte syndrome ( BLS II ) ( 1,2 ) .
In contrast , aberrant or over-expression of class II genes has been associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases ( 3 ) .
Expression of class II determinants is regulated at the level of transcriptional initiation ( reviewed in 2,4-7 ) and requires the class II trans-activator ( CIITA ) ( 8 ) .
CHTA was isolated by genetic complementation of a class II-negative BLS II cell line ® ) .
Induction of class II genes by IFNy requires de novo synthesis of CIITA ( 9,10 ) .
CIITA is expressed at high levels in mature B cells and its extinction in terminally differentiated plasma cells is correlated with the absence of class II determinants ( 11 ) .
By activating expression of the invariant chain , HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB , CIITA is also associated with other aspects of antigen processing and presentation ( 12,13 ) .
In the mouse , disruption of the CIITA gene resulted in loss of class II gene expression in all tissues except for isolated thymic epithelial cells ( 14 ) .
Normal development of CD4* T cells was severely impaired and other hallmarks of the BLS II phenotype were faithfully reproduced ( 14 ) .
Thus , CHTA functions as the 'master switch ' for expression of class II genes in all cells examined to date .
Like many proteins involved in transcriptional regulation , the 1130 amino acid CIHITA protein has a modular structure .
The N-terminus is rich in acidic amino acids , which suggests that this region may function as an activation domain ( 8 ) .
Riley et al .
demonstrated that amino acids from position 1 to 125 could activate transcription via the DNA binding domain of Gal4 at levels similar to those observed with the full-length protein in B cells ( 15 ) .
Additional experiments demonstrated that a third of this activity remained with amino acids from position 37 to 125 ( 15 ) .
Similarly , Zhou et al .
mapped the activation domain of CIITA using LexA fusion proteins and demonstrated that amino acids from position 1 to 114 , which contain ~80 % of the acidic amino acid region , produced near wild-type levels of transcriptional activation in yeast ( 16 ) .
Moreover , when the N-terminal 300 amino acids of CIITA were replaced with the activation domain of VP16 from herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV1 ) the chimera activated expression of class II genes to levels ~25 % that of the wild-type CIITA ( 16 ) .
These data indicate that the N-terminal activation domain shares functional homology with VP16 and that the C-terminal 830 amino acids of CIITA are involved in targeting the protein to class II promoters .
Using acidic activators as models , we investigated the structure-function relationships of the N-terminal activation domain of CIITA .
Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of CITA yielded three putative ( -helices .
Each of these a-helices contains ~40 % acidic residues .
These predicted acidic a-helices provided a reasonable starting point for structural analyses of the activation domain of CITA .
Mutational analyses of these structures demonstrated that two of these ( -helices are required for the transcriptional activity of CIITA .
A CIITA protein in which these two active a-helices were deleted displayed a dominant negative phenotype in co-transfection experiments with wild-type CIITA .
In vitro binding studies revealed that the N-terminus of CIITA binds to the 32 kDa subunit of TFIID ( TAFpg32 ) and that the loss of transcriptional activation by deletion of the two active ( -helices from CIITA correlates directly with loss of its binding to TAFg32 .
We conclude that the interaction between CIITA and TAFpg32 is a critical event in the *To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Predicted structure and acidic amino acid content of the activation domain of CIITA .
( A ) The N-terminal 161 amino acids of CIITA function as a transcriptional activation domain .
There are three predicted -helices present in this region at amino acid positions 51-71 ( ah1 ) , 84-103 ( ah2 ) and 124-138 ( ah3 ) .
( B ) The primary amino acid sequences of the three present in the activation domain of CIITA .
Acidic residues ( glutamic acid and aspartic acid ) are in bold type ; the underlined glycine ( at position 58 ) and alanine ( at position 94 ) are targets for point mutation to proline .
RESULTS Prediction of the secondary structure in the N-terminal activation domain of CIITA We wanted to determine if the N-terminal acidic activation domain of CIITA contained any predicted secondary structures which might provide insight into its function .
Specifically , the presence of ( -helices , which represent functional motifs in other acidic activators ( 23-25 ) , could provide a starting point for mutagenesis of CIITA .
The primary amino acid sequence of CITA was analyzed using MacVector computer software ( Eastman Kodak , New Haven , CT ) .
Both the Chou-Fasman and Robson-Garnier methods were employed and three consensus ( -helices were detected , which we labeled ahl ( amino acids 51-71 ) ah2 ( amino acids 84-103 ) and ah3 ( amino acids 124-138 ; Fig .
1A ) .
Inspection of the primary sequence of each of these -helices demonstrated that they were rich in acidic amino acid residues ( Fig .
1B ) .
Based on this analysis , these three acidic -helices were chosen as the focus for a mutational analysis of the activation domain of CIITA .
Mutation of ah1 and ah2 , but not ah3 , results in loss of activation of the DRA promoter by CIITA We wanted to determine if the three predicted acidic -helices in the activation domain of CIITA were important for its ability to activate the DRA promoter , which is the prototypic class II promoter ( 18 ) .
Each of the three ( -helices was deleted from full-length CIITA and activation of the DRA promoter by mutant and wild-type CIITA proteins was assayed in HeLa cells .
The plasmid target pDRASCAT contains the DRA promoter from position -150 to +31 linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene ( Fig .
2 ) .

pSVSPORT-1 is the parental plasmid effector , containing the SV40 early promoter and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence .

expression which were 54-fold greater than those with pDRASCAT alone ( Fig .
2 ) .
Deletion of the N-terminal 161 amino acids of CITA ( pSVCIITAAN ) resulted in complete loss of CHTA function ( Fig .
2 ) .
When ahl ( pSVCIITAAah1 ) or ah2 ( pSVCIHITAAgah ?
2 ) were deleted , activation of pDRASCAT was reduced .
pSVCIITAAah1 activated pDRASCAT 14-fold , representing 27 % of the wild-type CIITA activity ( Fig .
2 ) .
The reduction in activity with pSVCIITAAah2 was more severe .
Expression of pDRASCAT was reduced to 20 % of that with wild-type CIITA ( Fig .
2 ) .
Deletion of both ah1 and ah2 ( pSVCIITAAah12 ) resulted in an essentially non-functional protein which activated transcription to levels only 9 % of the wild-type CIITA ( Fig .
2 ) , similar to removal of the entire activation domain of CIHITA .
In sharp contrast , deletion of the C-terminal -helix ( ah3 ) was not detrimental to the function of CHTA .
pSVCIITAAah3 was able to activate pDRASCAT to nearly wild-type levels , i.e .
50-fold .
To test the structural predictions regarding the ahl and ah2 regions , proline substitutions were made in the center of each of the two active ( -helices , alone and in combination .
Such insertions should disrupt formation of the a-helix .
in which the glycine residue at position 58 of ahl was converted to proline ( Fig .
1B ) , activated pDRASCAT 38-fold , which represented 71 % of the activation by wild-type CIITA .
Disruption of ah2 by mutation of alanine at position 94 to proline [ pSVCIITA ( AY4P ) ] had a more severe effect on CIITA function , following the trend of the larger deletions .
pSVCIITA ( AAP ) activated pDRASCAT at levels 43 % of those observed with wild-type CIITA ( Fig .
2 ) .
When both alanine to proline mutations are present in CIHITA [ pSVCIHITA ( GS8PAQAP ) ] , activation of pDRASCAT is reduced to 39 % that of wild-type CIITA ( Fig .
2 ) .
We conclude that ah1 and ah2 are critical for activation of the DRA promoter by CITA and likely represent true acidic ( -helices .
To determine if the acidic residues present in the activation domain of CIHITA are indeed required to activate transcription , we made mutations in ah2 , sequentially reducing the number of acidic residues .
In plasmid pSVCIITA ( Aah2DE-N ) an aspartic acid residue at position 84 and a glutamic acid residue at position 86 were mutated to alanines and the resulting CITA protein assayed for its ability to activate pDRASCAT .
The loss of these two acidic residues resulted in a drop in activation to 34 % that of wild-type CIHITA .
Three additional acidic amino acids were then mutated to alanine ( aspartic acid at position 88 and two glutamic acids at positions 89 and 90 ) to produce plasmid pSVCII-TA ( Aah2DE-NC ) .
This further reduction in net negative charge resulted in a severe reduction in activation , to 18 % of wild-type CIITA .
It should be noted that the loss of five of eight acidic residues in ah2 [ plasmid pSVCIHITA ( Aah2DE-NC ) ] resulted in a CIITA protein which activated transcription at levels similar to that seen when the entire ah2 region was deleted .
This indicates that the acidic nature of the ah2 region is indispensable for its ability to activate transcription .
Deletion of ah1 and ah2 specifically affect function of the activation domain of CIITA The reduction in activity of CIITA proteins bearing the deletion of ah 1 and ah2 could be due to unrelated structural changes in the protein , rather than to specific alterations in function of its activation domain , even though CIITA protein expression levels were equivalent ( data not presented ) .
For example , a deletion of only 24 amino acids at the C-terminus of CIITA produced a completely non-functional protein in the BLSII cell line BLS2 ( 8 ) .
Since such small deletions can affect function or stability of the entire protein , we decided to test integrity of the activation domain independently of full-length CHTA .
Therefore , fusion proteins between the 147 amino acid DNA binding domain of Gal4 and the region of CIITA containing the three o-helices ( the 'three o-helix region ' ) from wild-type and mutated CIITA were constructed .
The plasmid effector pGal4C ( 44-143 ) was constructed by inserting the cDNA coding for amino acids from position 44 to 143 of CITA next to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 .
Following their co-transfection into COS cells , pGalA4C ( 44-143 ) activated the plasmid target pGSbCAT , which contains five Gal4 binding sites upstream of the CAT reporter gene , 58-fold greater than the parental vector pSG424 ( Fig .
3 ) .
Deletion of ahl from pGal4C ( 44-143 ) , to produce pGal4CAah1 , activated pGSbCAT only 14-fold over baseline levels ( Fig .
3 ) .
This level of expression represents 24 % of the activation observed with pGal4C ( 44-143 ) .
ah2 , which was deleted in pGal4CAah2 , proved again to be the more active ( -helix .
Activation with pGal4CAah2 was 10-fold greater than baseline levels , representing only 16 % of the wild-type activity ( Fig .
3 ) .

The plasmid target pGSbCAT ( 0.5 ug ) ( 1 ) , containing five Gal4 binding sites and the TATA box from the adenovirus E1 gene upstream of the CAT gene , was co-transfected with the indicated plasmid effector ( 1.5 ug ) into COS cells .
The parental plasmid effector , pSG424 ( 17 ) , expressed the Gal4 DNA binding domain from the SV40 early promoter .
The remaining plasmid effectors express wild-type or ¢-helix-deleted CIITA from amino acid position 44 to 143 , fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain .

was non-functional and activated transcription only 2-fold ( Fig .
3 ) .
Interestingly , deletion of ah3 produced slightly increased activation of transcription .
pGal4CAah3 increased expression from pGSbCAT 73-fold , to levels which were 125 % of those observed with pGal4C ( 44-143 ) .
This result may be due to the increased accessibility of ahl and ah2 to the general transcriptional apparatus .
We conclude that the three o-helix region , comprising amino acids from position 44 to 143 , is sufficient for transcriptional activation by CIITA and that ahl and ah2 are required for this activity .
CIITAAah12 represents a dominant negative CIITA The ah deletions in the N-terminal activation domain are not likely to effect function of the remainder of the protein .
Since the C-terminal 830 amino acids of CIITA are sufficient to direct the protein to the DRA promoter ( 16 ) , it is likely that the CIHITAAah12 mutant still interacts at the promoter .
However , since CIHITAAah12 can not activate transcription , it might function as a dominant negative CIITA protein .
To test this possibility , pSVCIHITA was co-transfected with pDRASCAT and increasing amounts of pSVCIHITAAah12 into COS cells .
Co-transfection of pDRASCAT with pSVCIITA resulted in levels of expression 17-fold greater than with pDRASCAT alone in COS cells .
Addition of pSVCIITAAah12 at a 2:1 ratio to pSVCIITA resulted in an ~50 % reduction of expression from pDRASCAT ( Fig .

At a ratio of 8:1 , expression fell further , to 30 % of levels observed with pSVCIITA alone ( Fig .

These results confirm that deletion of ah1 and ah2 from CIITA does not inhibit the ability of the protein to interact with the DRA promoter , but rather only effects its ability to activate transcription .
ah1 and ab2 are required for full interaction of the activation domain of CIITA with the general transcription factor TAFp32 Transcriptional activation by acidic activators has been correlated with their ability to interact with components of the general transcriptional machinery .
VP16 , for example , binds to several general transcription factors , including the 32 kDa subunit of the human TATA binding complex TFIID , TAFg32 ( 19 ) .
Given its functional homology to VP16 ( 16 ) , we examined whether CHTA might also bind to TFIID via the TAFpg32 subunit and whether ah 1 and ah2 are important for this interaction .
In vitro binding assays were performed with fusion proteins containing the activation domain of wild-type and mutant CIITA proteins fused to GST and nuclear extracts from human B cells .
Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting , using an anti-TAFpg32 antiserum .
Two prokaryotic expression plasmids were constructed to express GST fusion proteins in E.coli .
GSTCHTA ( I-144 ) contained the first 144 amino acids of CHTA , which included the three -helix region .
The second fusion protein was similar , except that ah1 and ah2 were deleted to produce GSTCIITA ( 1-144 ) Aah12 .
The chimeras were incubated with nuclear extracts from human B cells and then purified using glutathione Sepharose beads .
After extensive washing , the GSTCIITA fusion proteins and any interacting proteins were eluted from the beads using glutathione and resolved on SDS-PAGE .
Western blotting with the anti-TAFp32 antiserum was performed to determine if TAFpg32 bound to either of these two fusion proteins .
The 32 kDa TAFpg32 protein was easily detected in unfractionated nuclear extracts ( Fig .
5 , lane 1 ) .
TAFp32 was not detected when the chimera deleted of ah1 and ah2 [ GSTCIHITA ( 1-144 ) A¥ah12 ] was used in the binding reaction ( Fig .
5 , lane 2 ) .
However , TAFpg32 was present in the eluate from the binding reaction containing GSTCITA ( I-144 ) ( Fig .

Probing identical blots with an anti-GST antiserum demonstrated that equal amounts of the 1 2 3 TAFj32 > | wi wer 4 5 6 GSTCHTA ( 1-143 ) > GSTCHIA ( I-143 ) Aah12 > -- == = Figure 5. ah1 and ah2 are required for interaction of CIITA with the general transcription factor TAFpg32 .

Additional bands present in lane 5 are likely to be degradation products of GSTCIHITA ( 1-144 ) ah12 .
GST-CIITA fusion proteins were present in the binding reaction ( Fig .
5 lanes 4-6 ) .
From these results we conclude that the first 144 amino acids of CHTA can interact with TAFg32 and that this interaction requires the presence of both ah1 and ah2 .
Since ah1 and ah2 are necessary for transcriptional activation by CIITA , this result implies that binding of TAFg32 is required for this activity .
Binding ability of CIHITA and CIITA mutants to TAFp32 corresponds with transcriptional activation We demonstrated above that the first 144 amino acids of CHITA , which contain the three o-helix region , interact with TAFg32 .
We therefore wanted to try to coordinate the ability of CHTA and mutations of CIITA to bind to TAFpq32 with their ability to activate the DRA promoter .
In vitro binding assays were performed using a GST-TAFg32 fusion protein and wild-type and mutant CIITA proteins produced by in vitro transcription/translation of CIITA expression plasmids .
Binding reactions and elutions were carried out as in Figure 5 and eluates were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography of the [ °SJmethionine-labeled CITA .
Full-length wild-type CHTA and CIITAAah3 bound to GST-TAFp32 equivalently ( Fig .
6 , lanes 1 and 4 respectively ) .
This result implies that fully functional CIITA proteins interact well with TAFg32 .
In contrast , CHTAAah1 and CIHITAAah2 bound to TAFpg32 very poorly ( Fig .
6 , lanes 3 and 4 respectively ) , with CIHITAAah1 binding slightly more than CHITAAah2 , consistent with the results of the co-transfection experiments in Figure 2 .
With the double mutation CHIHTAAah12 there was almost no detectable binding to TAFp32 ( Fig .

In all cases , the binding profiles of mutant CIITA proteins to GST-TAFp32 corresponded with their ability to activate the DRA promoter in HeLa cells .
We conclude that the interaction between CIITA and TAFpg32 is required for transcriptional activity of CIITA .
DISCUSSION The N-terminal 125 amino acids of CITA have been defined as an independent transcriptional activation domain ( 15 ) .
Computer analyses of the primary amino acid sequence of the CIITA activation domain predicted the presence of three a-helices rich in acidic amino acids .
ahl and ah2 , the N-terminal and middle acidic ( -helices , were found to be required for full activation of the class II DRA promoter .
Deletion of ah1 and ah2 or amino acid substitutions which disrupted formation of the a-helices resulted in a severe reduction in function of the mutant CIITA proteins .
Similarly , sequential reduction in net negative charge of ah2 resulted in concurrent reduction in the ability of the mutated CIITA proteins to activate transcription .
In contrast , mutation of the C-terminal -helix , ah3 , was not detrimental to the activity of CIITA .
Mutations which resulted in loss of transactivation of the DRA promoter by CIITA also resulted in proportional loss of binding to the 32 kDa subunit of the general transcription complex TFIID , TAFpg32 .
From these data we conclude that the functional motifs in the CIITA activation domain are the acidic Nucleic Acids Research , 1997 , Vol .

12 - 2527 CHTA ACTIVATES TRANSCRIPTION VIA TAFpp32 CLASS II PROMOTER Figure 7 .
Protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions on the DRA promoter .
NFY and RFX bind to conserved upstream sequences ( S , X and Y boxes ) of class II promoters .
NFY stabilizes binding of RFX to the X box and might contribute to interactions with CIITA .
Cooperative binding occurs between RFX complexes bound at the S and X boxes .
Although CIITA requires minimally the X box , no direct binding between RFX and CITA has been demonstrated .
The B cell-specific co-activator Bob1 ( OBF-1/0CA-B ) interacts directly with CIITA , to increase transcription levels in B cells .
The activation domain of CIITA interacts with TAFIIM32 , which is a component of the TAF-TBP complex ( TFIID ) .
These protein-protein interactions increase rates of initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription .
( -helices ahl and ah2 and that interaction between these -helices and TAFpg32 is required for transcriptional activation by CHITA .
CITA is an acidic transcriptional activator .
This group of activators were first defined based on studies with the yeast proteins GALA and GCN4 ( 16,26 ) .
It was found that their ability to activate transcription correlated generally with the net negative charge of the acidic domain ( 16,26 ) .
Additional studies using random genomic DNA from E.coli ( 27 ) and artificially constructed sequences ( 25 ) demonstrated that the presence of an acidic amphipathic ( -helix correlated with the ability of that sequence to activate transcription .
Subsequent experiments , however , found that the C-terminal activation motif of GALA may not contain ( -helices and that acidic residues were not critical for activator function ( 28,29 ) .
In contrast to what we have determined for CIHITA , disruption of potential ( -helices in VP16 by insertion of proline residues did not affect its ability to activate transcription ( 30 ) .
However , a recent report has identified a functional acidic -helix ( 24 ) similar to what we have found with CHITA .
In addition , the requirement of net negative charge has been firmly established for many activators ( 31-34 ) , as well as the presence of bulky hydrophobic residues which are required for transcriptional activation ( 35-37 ) .
We have presented here strong evidence that CIITA contains functional acidic ( -helices which are necessary for transcriptional activation .
To activate transcription of class II genes , assembly of protein-DNA complexes must first occur at the three conserved upstream sequences ( CUS ) present in all class II promoters , the S , X and Y boxes ( Fig .
7 ) .
Following cooperative binding of factors to these elements ( 38-41 ) , CIITA makes three important protein-protein contacts .
The first is with the complexes bound at the S , X and Y boxes ( Fig .
7 ) .
The nature of these contacts is unknown .
Repeated attempts to demonstrate direct binding between CIITA and the X box binding complex RFX ( 42 ) have been unsuccessful ( data not shown ) .

12 sufficient to target CIITA to the promoter ( 16 ) .
That the mutant protein CIHITAAah12 could block activity of wild-type CIHITA on the DRA promoter provides a further indication that the C-terminal portion of the molecule is involved in promoter targeting .
The second protein-protein interaction is between the B cell-specific co-activator Bobl ( OBF-1 , OCA-B ) ( 43-45 ) and CIITA ( 46 ) .
The result of this interaction may be to increase expression of class II genes in B cell lines , by virtue of an additional activation domain being presented by CIITA .
The third protein-protein contact is between CIITA and the general transcriptional apparatus .
We have shown here that this occurs at TAFpg32 ( Fig .
7 . )
.
Identification of the two a-helices which are the precise contact points with TAFg32 provides an extremely useful target for potential exogenous manipulation of class II gene expression .
Aside from using the dominant negative CIHITAAah12 , small molecules which mimic the structure of ah 1 and/or ah2 could potentially block the function of CITA specifically .
In light of the fact that aberrant expression of class II molecules contributes to a variety of autoimmune inflammatory diseases ( 3 ) , such reagents would be of great benefit in treating these conditions .
Our results to date do not rule out the possibility that CIITA may itself be functioning as a TAF and that its interaction with TAFg32 represents the primary contact point between CIITA and TFIID .
Recent reports identifying a B cell-specific TAF ( 47 ) and the observations that the large T antigen of SV40 virus ( 48 ) as well as the pX protein of HBV ( 49 ) may function as TAFs make this possibility intriguing .
The presence of CIHITA in a cell may potentially create 'class II-tropic ' TFIID complexes , which would promote high levels of expression from target genes .
In this way , large groups of genes responsible for most aspects of antigen presentation could be activated in a global manner .
