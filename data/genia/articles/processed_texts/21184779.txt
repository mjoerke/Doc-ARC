Gadd45y Is Dispensable for Normal Mouse Development and T-Cell Proliferation ANGELIKA HOFFMEYER , ROLAND PIEKORZ , RICHARD MORIGGL , ft anp JAMES N. IHLE* Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Department of Biochemistry , St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital , Memphis , Tennessee 38105 Received 1 December 2000/Returned for modification 22 January 2001/Accepted 1 February 2001 Gadd45y , a family member of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene family 45 ( Gadd45 ) , is strongly induced by interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) in peripheral T cells .
While in most tissues all Gadd45 family members are expressed , Gadd45y is the only member that is induced by IL-2 .
Here we show that the IL-2-induced expression of Gadd45y is dependent on a signaling pathway mediated by the tyrosine kinase Jak3 and the transcription factors StatSa and StatSb ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) .
Previous studies with ectopically overexpressed Gadd457y in various cell lines implicated its function in negative growth control .
To analyze the physiological role of Gadd45y we used homologous recombination to generate mice lacking Gadd45y .
Gadd4Sy-deficient mice develop normally , are indistinguishable from their littermates , and are fertile .
Furthermore , hematopoiesis in mice lacking Gadd45y is not impaired and Gadd4S5y-deficient T lymphocytes show normal responses to IL-2 .
These data demonstrate that Gadd457 is not essential for normal mouse development and hematopoiesis , possibly due to functional redundancy among the Gadd45 family members .
Gadd45y is also dispensable for IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation .
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -driven T-cell proliferation is critical to understanding the regulation of the immune system .
The signaling pathways emerging from the IL-2 receptor require Jak3 and Jak1 , two members of the JANUS family of tyrosine kinases ( Jak ) , which bind to and phosphorylate the IL-2 receptor as well as sub-strates recruited to the receptor complex .
Among the sub-strates are StatSa and Stat5b ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) , both of which are phosphorylated and trans-located to the nucleus where they activate gene transcription ( reviewed in references 8 and 9 ) .
Mice lacking either Jak3 or both StatSa and StatS5b ( StatSa/b ) have revealed their essential function for IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation ( 13 , 15 ) .
In an attempt to delineate the IL-2 signaling pathway downstream of Stat5a/b in T cells , we screened a subtracted cDNA library for Stat5 target genes .
Applying representational difference analysis ( RDA ) and subsequent Northern blot analysis of activated wild-type versus StatSa/b double knockout splenocytes , we were able to identify IL-2-inducible , Stat5-dependent genes .
Among the clones obtained was the murine gene of Gadd45y , which shows 97 % identity at the amino acid level to its human counterpart ( 20 ) .
This gene had been previously identified by several approaches , including as an activator of MEKKA4/ MTK1 ( 17 ) , an IL-2-induced immediate-early gene ( cytokine response gene 6 [ CR6 ] ) ( 3 ) , an oncostatin M-inducible gene ( OIG37 ) ( 14 ) , a gene induced by depletion of neurotrophic factor in PC12 neuronal cells ( 11 ) , and a gene coding for a Gadd-related protein of 17 kDa ( GRP17 ) ( 16 ) .

3137 In addition to Gadd45y , the Gadd45 family ( growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene family ) consists of Gadd45 « and Gadd45B , whose murine isoform is also designated MyD118 ( 1 , 5 ) .
Gadd45y shows high sequence similarity to Gadd4S5 « and Gadd45f at the amino acid level ( 68 and 70 % , respective-ly ) .
All Gadd45 family members are small , acidic proteins that are expressed to different degrees in all tissues ( 14 ) .
Overexpression of any of the family members in various cell lines leads to association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen and p21 , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , and results in growth suppression ( 4 , 14 ) .
These findings led to the hypothesis that Gadd45 members play a critical role in negative growth control .
Individual Gadd45 family members are characterized by specific inducible patterns of expression ( reviewed in reference 12 ) .
Gadd4S « is induced in a pS53-dependent manner by y irradiation ( 10 ) .
Gadd45B is upregulated by transforming growth factor B , which induces growth arrest and apoptosis in the myeloid cell line M1 ( 1 ) .
Moreover , both Gadd4S5 « and Gadd45B are induced by IL-6 , a differentiation-inducing cyto-kine , and by DNA-damaging agents such as methyl methane-sulfonate ( MMS ) ( 19 ) .
In contrast to the inducible expression pattern of Gadd4S « and Gadd45 $ B associated with growth ar-rest , differentiation , and apoptosis , Gadd45y has been shown to be induced in the proliferative response of T cells to IL-2 ( 3 , 20 ) .
This finding led to the hypothesis that IL-2 also mediates negative growth control elements such as Gadd45y to ensure proper cell cycling and genomic stability ( 20 ) .
On the other hand , it could be hypothesized that Gadd457y supports growth promotion when expressed at physiological levels .
In order to elucidate the physiological function of Gadd45~y , we generated Gadd4Sy-deficient mice by using targeted gene disruption .
Here , we show that Gadd45y is dispensable for normal mouse development , hematopoiesis , and in particular , IL-2-driven T-cell proliferation .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of the Gadd45y targeting vector and generation of mutant mice .
A Gadd45y genomic clone was isolated from a 129SV/J mouse genomic library ( Genome Systems Inc. ) .
An 8-kb genomic EcoRI fragment containing all four exons coding for Gadd45y was used to construct a targeting vector .
A 2-kb BstEI fragment encompassing most of the coding region was replaced with a neomycin-resistance gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter .
This strategy led only the first 13 amino acids of intact Gadd45y to be translated , which , however , will not give rise to a stable product .
A cDNA coding for the diphtheria toxin A driven by the thymidine kinase promoter ( 2 ) was then cloned 3 ' of the genomic sequence to facilitate negative selection .
E14 embryonic stem ( ES ) cells ( 129/Ola mouse strain ) ( kindly provided by Jan van Deursen ) and RW4 ES cells ( 129/8vJ mouse strain ) ( Genome Systems Inc. ) were electroporated and selected for heterozygous targeted clones as described previously ( 18 ) .
To verify correct targeting by Southern blotting , a 5 ' external Xbal-EcoRI fragment was used to probe Xbal-digested genomic DNA resulting in a 6-kb wild-type and a 9-kb mutant fragment .
Correct recombination at the 3 ' region was confirmed by PCR .
Out of five targeted ES cell clones which were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts , two clones were successfully integrated into the germ line .
All experiments were performed with both mouse lines independently and gave the same results .
Genotypes of mice were routinely determined with tail DNA , by using PCR .
A mutant allele-specific primer ( 5'-CCACACTGCTCGACATTGGGTGG ) , a wild type-specific primer ( 5 % -GGACCCTGCCITTGGAGAAGCTC ) , and a common primer ( 5-GGTCGGTTCITTCCCGGCCCTGG ) were mixed in each reaction mixture , and PCR products of 150 and 350 bp in length appeared from the targeted and the wild-type alleles , respectively .
Northern blot analysis .
Whole-cell RNA was prepared using the RNAzo !
l B reagent ( Tel-Test ) according to the directions of the manufacturer .
For Northern blotting , 20 ug of RNA per lane was run on a 1 % formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes .
The cDNAs of Gadd45y , Gadd45 « , and Gadd45B , all cloned from mouse tissues , as well as the cDNAs from glyceralde-hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) and gamma interferon ( IFNy ) were used as probes , which were labeled by using a random priming kit ( ready-prime ; Amersham ) .
JNK kinase assay .
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) buffer , and cell debris was removed by centrifugation .
Supernatants were incubated with JNK1 antisera ( sc-474 ; Santa Cruz ) for 2 h at 4°C .
The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A agarose ( Roche ) and washed twice with RIPA buffer and twice with JNK kinase buffer ( 10 mM MgCl , , 50 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.4 ] , 5 mM benzamidine , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM sodium vanadate ) .
The kinase reaction was performed in kinase buffer supplemented with 5 wCi of 0.1 mM ATP , and glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -c-Jun ( 1-135 ) as a substrate for 20 min at 30°C .
Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto supported nitrocellulose membranes .
After autoradiography , the membranes were probed with JNK1 antisera ( sc-474 ; Santa Cruz ) and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G. To visualize the proteins , a standard enhanced chemiluminescence reaction was employed ( ECL ; Amersham ) .
Bone marrow colony assays .
Bone marrow cells were prepared from tibia and femur in « -MEM medium ( Life Technologies ) containing 2 % fetal calf serum ( StemCell Technologies ) mixed with cytokines and MethoCult M3230 ( StemCell Technologies ) giving a final concentration of 0.9 % methylcellulose .
For the assays the following cytokines were used : recombinant human erythropoietin ( Epo ) ( Amgen ) , recombinant murine IL-3 , IL-6 , stem cell factor ( SCF ) , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) ( R & D Systems ) , as well as recombinant human thrombopoictin ( TPO ) ( Genzyme ) .
Cultures were plated in 35-mm culture dishes in duplicates and cultured at 37°C .
The assay conditions were described previously ( 18 ) .
Growth curve and proliferation response assays .
A single-cell suspension , prepared from spleen and lymph nodes , was stimulated with 2 ug of anti-CD3 ( 2C11 ; PharMingen ) /ml and 500 U of recombinant human IL-2 ( Chiron ) /ml in RPMI 1640 media ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , L-glutamine , penicillin , streptomycin , sodium pyruvate , essential and nonessential amino acids ( all from Life Technologies ) , and B-mercaptocthanol ( Sigma ) .
To determine the growth curve of T cells , cells were kept in IL-2-containing media and were split when they reached a cell density above 10°/ml .
Viable cell counts were determined by trypan blue staining every 48 h. Cell cycle arrest of the growing T-cell culture was achieved by IL-2 withdrawal for 20 h and confirmed by propidium iodide DNA staining .
To assess the proliferative response to IL-2 , 2 x 10° growth-arrested T cells Mor .

Gadd45y is strongly induced in T cells via IL-2 but not TCR signaling .
Splenocytes were incubated with anti-CD3 thereby activating T cells , which were then grown in IL-2 for 7 days .
Cell cycle arrest in G , phase of the pure T-cell culture was achieved by IL-2 withdrawal .
Growth-arrested cells were then stimulated with IL-2 , anti-CD3 , and anti-CD28 as indicated in the figure .
Northern blot analysis of starved ( time point , 0 ) and stimulated T cells was performed using Gadd45y- , Gadd45B- , and Gadd4Se « -specific probes .
It is worth noticing that the blot was exposed for 6 days when probed with Gadd45B as well as Gadd45a .
but for only 4 h when probed with Gadd45y .
As a loading control the blot was probed with GAPDH .
were plated into 1 well of a 96-well round-bottomed plate in 200 pl of T-cell medium ( see above ) with indicated amounts of IL-2 .
After 8 h of stimulation , 1 wCi of [ °H ] thymidine ( Amersham Life Sciences ) was added to the culture for another 16 h. Cells were harvested and the incorporated was measured as counts per minute in a beta counter .
Staining of cells with Annexin V. Approximately 5 X 10° cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline , resuspended in 100 jl of binding buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 0.9 % NaCl , 2.5 mM CaCl , , 0.1 % bovine serum albumin ) containing 2 ul of Annexin V-Fluos ( Annexin V bound to fluorescein isothiocyanate ; Roche ) and 1 pg of propidium iodide/ml , and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark .
The samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , Calif. ) , collecting green fluorescence from bound Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate molecules and red fluorescence from propidium iodide-DNA complexes in dead cells .
Irradiation and determination of the mitotic index .
Splenocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3 ( 2 ug/ml ! )
and grown in IL-2-containing medium ( 200 U/ml ! )
for 4 days .
At this time the doubling time of the lymphocytes is approximately 16 h. Cells were then subjected to UV or y irradiation .
To determine the mitotic index , cells were incubated in 75 mM KCl for 15 min and fixed with methanol-acetic acid fixative .
Cells were dropped on microscope slides and stained with Giemsa stain .
Cells with condensed chromosomes were scored as mitotic cells .
RESULTS IL-2-induced Gadd45y transcription is Stat5 and Jak3 de-pendent .
In screening for IL-2-induced genes by RDA ( 6 ) , we identified one clone which hybridized with two transcripts of 1.4 and 4 kb in IL-2-activated T cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
Sequence analysis and a similarity search in GenBank identified this clone as the murine homolog of Gadd45y , also designated CR6 ( 17 , 20 ) .
The closest related genes to Gadd45y are Gadd4S5S « and Gadd45B , which , as illustrated in Fig .
1 , are not regulated in T Vor .

Gadd45y is induced in activated T cells via a Jak3-Stat5-mediated pathway .
Splenocytes from Stat5a/b double knockout mice ( Stat5 k.0 .
, lanes 6 to 10 ) and their wild-type ( wt ) littermates ( lanes 1 to 5 ) as well as from Jak3 knockout ( lanes 19 to 23 ) and wild-type ( lanes 14 to 18 ) mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 and IL-2 for the indicated times .
In addition , Stat5a/b-deficient splenocytes were rescued with retroviral gene insertion of StatSa while activated with anti-CD3 and then grown in IL-2 for 10 days .
Reconstituted cells , which consisted of 90 % retrovirus-harboring T cells , were then starved for 20 h and restimulated with IL-2 for the indicated times ( lanes 11 to 13 ) .
Total RNA from each of these time points was loaded on an agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to show equal loading ( lower panels ) and thereafter blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes .
Membranes were blotted with the cDNAs from Gadd45y ( upper panels ) as well as from IFN-y ( middle panels ) , the latter of which is induced in primary T cells independent of Stat5 and Jak3 but is dependent on the T-cell receptor .
cells upon activation .
Gadd45y is also induced in primary splenic T cells activated by anti-CD3 and IL-2 , but not in Stat5a/b-deficient T cells ( Fig .
2 , lanes 1 to 10 ) , which have normal T-cell receptor signaling but fail to proliferate in response to IL-2 ( 13 ) .
Gadd45y expression could be reconstituted in StatSa/b-deficient T cells transduced by a retrovirus carrying the wild-type StatSa gene ( Fig .
2 , lanes 11 to 13 ) , demonstrating that the impaired Gadd457y induction is due to the lack of Stat5 .
Since Stat5a/b activation by IL-2 is dependent on the tyrosine kinase Jak3 , we compared Gadd457y induction in wild-type versus Jak3-deficient splenocytes .
As shown in Fig .
2 ( lanes 14 to 23 ) , Gadd45y transcription is not elevated in Jak3-deficient splenocytes treated with anti-CD3 and IL-2 .
These data demonstrate that IL-2-induced Gadd45y expression in peripheral T cells is dependent on signaling through Jak3 and StatSa/b and that T cells uniquely express Gadd45y among the Gadd45 family of genes .
Generation of Gadd4Sy-deficient mice .
To assess the physiological function of Gadd45y we generated Gadd4Sy-deficient mice .
In the targeting construct most of the coding sequence was replaced by a neomycin resistance gene cassette ( Fig .
3A ) in order to generate a null mutation .
Out of five homologous recombinant ES cell clones , two clones gave rise to germ line-transmitted mutant mouse strains as confirmed by Southern blot and PCR ( Fig .
3B and C ) .
Heterozygous mice of both lines were crossed to examine the phenotype caused by Gadd45y deficiency .
Intercrosses in both mouse lines gave birth to homozygous mutant Gadd45y mice that were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates and were fertile and viable for at least 1 year .
Northern blot analysis of IL-2-induced Gadd45y-deficient T cells showed that neither transcript of Gadd45y was detectable ( Fig .
3D ) .
Histological analysis of organs in which Gadd45y is highly expressed , such as liver and kidney , revealed no abnormalities in Gadd457 null mice ( data not shown ) .
The cellularity of hematopoietic tissues ( bone marrow , thymus , spleen , and lymph nodes ) and peripheral blood as well as the appearance of progenitor and mature T and B cells , NK cells , macro-phages , granulocytes , and erythrocytes were comparable to wild-type littermates ( data not shown ) .
These data show that Gadd45y is not essential for normal mouse development and hematopoiesis .
Cytokine response of Gadd4Sy-deficient bone marrow cells .
Gadd45y expression is induced by several cytokines , including IL-3 , IL-6 , and GM-CSF ( 20 ) .
Based on distinct expression patterns of the three Gadd45 family members , specific functions for each family member have been proposed .
We , therefore , analyzed the contribution of Gadd45y to the cytokine response of bone marrow cells .
As shown in Table 1 , Gadd45y is dispensable for the ability of bone marrow cells to form colonies in response to IL-3 , IL-6 , SCF , Epo , TPO , and GM-CSF .
Ability of Gadd45y-deficient T lymphocytes to proliferate .
Since Gadd4S5y is strongly induced by IL-2 in peripheral T cells , we investigated the proliferative abilities of Gadd45y-deficient T cells .
For these studies , splenocytes were activated with anti-CD3 and IL-2 or IL-4 or without the addition of cytokine .
Thereby , anti-CD3 stimulation activates all T cells , the addition of IL-4 favors the T helper 2 subset of CD4-positive T cells , and the presence of IL-2 favors CD8-positive T-cell subsets .
The cell numbers of the growing cultures were monitored every 48 h. No differences were evident between wild-type and Gadd4Sy-deficient T cells ( data not shown ) .
Irrespective of their genetic background , activated T cells proliferated in the presence of IL-2 for 14 to 18 days and exponential growth occurred between day 4 and day 9 ( Fig .
4A ) .
During this period the doubling times of the T-cell cultures from +/+ , +/- , and -/- Gadd45y mice from three independent experiments were 17.6 + 1.4 h , 18.5 + 2.7 h , and 18.0 + 2.3 h , respectively .

Targeted disruption of Gadd45y in mice .
( A ) The murine Gadd45y gene consists of 4 exons with the start codon in exon 1 ( indicated by an arrow ) and the stop codon in exon 4 ( indicated by an asterisk ) .
A targeting vector was constructed in which most of the coding region was replaced by a neomycin gene cassette .
( B and C ) Successful targeting was confirmed by Southern blot ( B ) using an external probe ( indicated in panel A ) and by PCR ( C ) with primers symbolized in panel A as triangles .
( D ) Northern blot analysis of IL-Z-activated T cells with a Gadd4Sy-specific probe from the coding region shows no hybridizing signal in knockout cells .
As described in the Fig .
2 legend , growing T-cell cultures were starved and restimulated with or without IL-2 for 2 h and the RNA was harvested , subjected to electrophoresis , and blotted .
Gadd4Sy-deficient T cells was observed in the late phase of some experiments ; however , wild-type as well as Gadd45y-deficient cells stopped cycling after a comparable time in culture ( Fig .
4A ) .
Moreover , after 4 days the numbers of CD4-and CD8-positive T cells were similar in cultures of wild-type and Gadd45y-deficient T cells ( data not shown ) .
To investigate the contribution of Gadd457 to the ability of cultured T cells to arrest in the G , phase after withdrawal of IL-2 and reenter the cell cycle after IL-2 restimulation , cultured T cells grown in the presence of IL-2 for 7 days were starved and restimulated with IL-2 .

There was no significant difference between wild-type and knockout T cells with respect to growth arrest and IL-2-regulated cell cycle progression ( data not shown ) .
In addition , proliferation in response to increasing IL-2 concentrations was measured by thymidine incorporation .
Fig .
4B illustrates that the proliferative response of cell cycle-arrested T cells from wild-type and Gadd4Sy-deficient mice to increasing amounts of IL-2 was not statistically different .
In order to exclude compensatory upregulation of Gadd4S5 « and/or Gadd45f in Gadd4Sy-deficient T cells , the expression of all three family members was analyzed by Northern blotting ( Fig .
4C ) and demonstrated the absence of upregulation of the other family members .
Finally , as measured by Annexin V staining , the number of apoptotic cells did not differ between wild-type and Gadd4Sy-deficient T cells ( Fig .
4D ) .
JNK activity in Gadd4Sy-deficient T lymphocytes .
Gadd45 family members have been implicated in controlling the activity of the Jun N-terminal kinase , JNK , via binding to the ubiquitously expressed protein kinase MTKI/MEKK4 ( 17 ) .
The binding of Gadd45y to MTK1/MEKK4 is thought to activate the kinase activity of MTK1 , which in turn activates MEKK3 and MEKK6 , upstream activators of JNK .
We investigated the JNK activity in wild-type T cells cultured for 4 days in the presence of IL-2 , at which time they expressed high levels of Gadd45y .

The cultures were kept in IL-2-containing media and were split when they reached a cell density above 10°/ml .
Viable cell counts were determined by trypan blue staining every 48 h. Three independently performed experiments ( A1 , A2 , and A3 ) are shown in the figure .
( B ) Cultured T cells of +/+ ( diamond ) , +/- ( square ) , and -/- ( triangle ) mice which were grown in the presence of IL-2 for 7 days were starved for 20 h and then stimulated with increasing amounts of IL-2 .
The proliferation rate was determined via a [ °H } thymidine incorporation assay and is given as counts per minute ( cpm ) .
The results are the averages of three experiments .
( C ) Northern blot analysis with starved ( w/o ) and IL-2-stimulated T cells of Gadd45y mice revealed no compensatory upregulation of the family members Gadd45B and Gadd45 « in Gadd45y-deficient T cells .
As a control , the same T-cell culture was incubated with 100 pg of cycloheximide ( CHX ) /ml for 2 h , which stabilizes the messages of Gadd45 family members .
( D ) Apoptotic T lymphocytes were determined by staining with Annexin V. Activated splenocytes were cultured in IL-2-containing media for 5 days , harvested and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Annexin V protein , which binds to the membranes of apoptotic cells .
To distinguish between dead cells and cells undergoing apoptosis , cells were incubated in propidium iodide solution , which stains only dead cells .
The cells were then analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan in two-color mode using CellQuest software .
From each genotype , six animals were analyzed ; a representative set including the percentage of cells in each quadrant is shown in the figure .

JNK activity of Gadd4Sy-deficient T cells .
Splenocytes of two Gadd45y*'* ( lanes 3 , 4 , 7 , and 8 ) and two Gadd45y '~ ( lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) animals were stimulated with anti-CD3 and cultured for 4 days in IL-2-containing media .
Half of the cells were stimulated with 100 pg of anisomycin/ml for 30 min ( lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) , and the other half was left untreated ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 ) .
Cells were harvested and JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from cleared cell lysates .
JNK1 immu-nocomplexes were then subjected to in vitro kinase assays using the N-terminal part of cJun as the substrate .
Kinase reactions were stopped after 30 min and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting .
The upper panels show the autoradiogram and lower panels the corresponding JNK1 Western blot demonstrating equal amounts of JNK1 .
between the basal levels of JNK activities ( Fig .
5 ) .
In addition , anisomycin-stimulated JNK activity is not altered in Gadd45y-deficient T cells ( Fig .
5 ) , demonstrating that Gadd45y is dispensable for JNK activity .
Checkpoint activation and genomic stability in Gadd45y-deficient T lymphocytes .
Since the Gadd45 family members have been implicated in genomic stability , we initially examined T cells that had been expanded for 14 days in culture for karyotypic abnormalities .
Examination of 60 cells failed to identify any abnormal karyotypes ( data not shown ) .
Gadd4S5 « -deficient lymphocytes have been shown to have defects in the cell cycle checkpoint activation after UV irradiation ( 7 ) .
Since Gadd45y is uniquely induced by IL-2 in proliferating T cells , we wished to examine the potential contribution of this induction to G , M arrest of UV or y-irradiated cells .
For these studies , T lymphocytes from wild-type and Gadd45y-deficient mice were expanded in vitro in the presence of IL-2 to allow the accumulation of Gadd45y in the wild-type cells .
As illustrated ( Fig .
6 ) , there were no differences between wild-type and Gadd4S5y-deficient T cells in the induction of G ; M arrest in response to increasing doses of either UV , as a DNA damaging agent , or y irradiation , as a DNA double-strand break-inducing agent .
Therefore , IL-2-induced expression of Gadd45y in T cells is not essential for genomic stability or cell cycle arrest under the conditions examined .
DISCUSSION In this report we demonstrate that IL-2 stimulation of T cells leads to the induction of Gadd45y in a Jak3- and Stat5-dependent manner .
However , in contrast to Stat5 , loss of Gadd45y does not affect T-cell activation and proliferation .
There are three possible explanations for the lack of any consequences .
First , although Gadd4S5 « and Gadd45B were not induced in IL-2-stimulated T cells , we can not exclude compensation by Mor .

another , unidentified member of the Gadd45 family with function overlapping that of Gadd45y .
However , this is unlikely since exhaustive searchs of murine or human expressed se-quences , as well as sequencing the clones identified in our RDA screen , have failed to identify another family member .
The second possibility is that critical functions mediated by Gadd457 are redundantly provided by another , unrelated gene product .
The third possibility is that the StatS5a/b-regulated expression of Gadd45y and the functional consequences are not critical for T-cell proliferation under the conditions examined .
A number of genes have been identified that are induced with the activation of peripheral T cells , and many of these are not induced in StatS5a/b-deficient lymphocytes .
For example , cyclin D2 and D3 are not expressed in Stat5-deficient T cells ( 13 ) .
In order to test the possibility that Gadd45y is required for their expression , we examined the expression of D-type cyclin mRNAs and proteins in activated Gadd4Sy-deficient T cells .
Both cyclin D2 and D3 were upregulated normally in Gadd457y null splenocytes when stimulated with anti-CD3 and IL-2 ( data not shown ) .
The dependence on StatS5a/b for Gadd45y expression in T cells and the reported requirement for Stat3 for the induction of Gadd45y in myeloid cells would suggest that Stat binding sites exist in the promoter and mediate the induction ( 14 ) .
However , we have not found any putative Stat binding sites in A 100 §3 `` TC 8 .E g 60 9 S b 8 o 40 3 ® - 20 0 2 10 20 UV [ J/m B 100 fel < 4 B £5 § 60 9 S Go u 8 o 40 3 & 20 0 0 50 100 y-IRR [ cGy ] FIG .

21 , 2001 the promoter sequence spanning 1 kb upstream of the putative TATA box nor in intronic sequences .
It is possible that Stat transcription factors act on enhancer elements further upstream of the gene or indirectly .
The lack of any consequence of deleting Gadd45y might suggest that , irrespective of the mechanism , the induction of Gadd45y may occur fortuitously because the gene shares genomic elements that are required for StatSa/b regulation of a gene that is critical for T-cell function .
Since the identification of Gadd45y , considerable effort has been invested in elucidating its functions including overexpression studies of Gadd45y in diverse cell lines .
One function of Gadd45y , deduced from such studies , is the activation of MEKK4 in response to MMS-induced cell death of ML-1 cells and the subsequent activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs ( 17 ) .
This prompted the authors to speculate the pathway Gadd45y - > MEKK4 - > p38/JNK , leading to apoptosis ( 17 ) .
However , other groups have not detected significant induction of Gadd4S5y after MMS treatment in M1 cells ( 20 ) or in NIH-3T3 cells ( 14 ) .
In addition , we found no evidence that MMS induces Gadd45y expression in T cells .
Irrespective of that , neither the basal nor anisomycin-stimulated JNK activity is altered in Gadd45Sy-deficient T cells ( Fig .
5 ) , demonstrating that Gadd45y is dispensable for JNK activity .
The consequences of the overexpression of Gadd45y have been variably reported to either induce apoptosis in HeLa cells ( 17 ) or not induce apoptosis but rather to reduce the growth rate of HeLa cells or NIH-3T3 and BaF3 cells ( 4 , 14 ) .
In this regard , the percentage of apoptotic cells in cultures of proliferating Gadd45y-null T cells is neither reduced nor enhanced in comparison to wild-type T cells ( Fig .
4D ) .
Nor is there any indication of a difference in the proliferative capacity , either increased or decreased , of Gadd4Sy-deficient T cells .
Therefore it is likely that the overexpression studies have not provided completely accurate information regarding the functions of Gadd45y in cell growth and apoptosis regulation .
Taken together , our results show that the Stat5a/b-regulated gene , Gadd45y , is dispensable for T-cell function and , in gen-eral , demonstrate that the identification of a target gene does not necessarily mean that the target gene mediates an essential function .
More generally , Gadd45y is not required for hematopoiesis or for normal development .
The existence of two additional family members raises the possibility that they function redundantly to Gadd45y in some critical cell lineages .
As with many gene families , it will be important to generate strains of mice that lack two or all of the family members to explore the possibility of redundancy .
