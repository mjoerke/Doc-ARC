Brown** ' NF of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) denotes a family of transcription factors that regulate the activation-dependent expression of many immunologically important proteins .
At least four distinct genes encode the various family members , and several isoforms of these have been identified as well .
The overlapping expression patterns and similar in vitro binding and frans-activation activities on various promoter elements of NF-AT-regulated genes suggest some redundancy in the function of these proteins .
However , the phenotypic analysis of NF-AT-deficient mice supports the idea that there are tissue- and gene-specific functions as well .
In this study we have characterized the expression of NF-AT cDNAs in murine mast cells .
The majority of clones identified correspond to two NF-ATc isoforms that differ only in their amino-terminal sequence .
Despite minimal discrepancies in the coding region , there are striking tissue- and cell type-specific differences in isoform expression patterns .
Detection of NF-ATc .
« @ mRNA is strictly dependent on cell activation signals in both T and mast cell lines .
In contrast , the 3 isoform is expressed at very low constitutive levels in both cell types but is only up-regulated in response to mast cell activation signals delivered through the FeeRI or via calcium ijonophores .
These results demonstrate another level of regulation within the NF-AT family that can contribute to cell type-specific gene expression .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 162 ; 2820-2828. uclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) * was origiN nally described as a T cell-specific DNA binding protein that regulates the activation-dependent transcription of the IL-2 gene ( 1 ) .
It is now known to denote a family of transcription factors that are expressed in a wide range of tissues and cell types , including mast cells ( 2 ) , B cells ( 3-5 ) , macrophages ( 6 ) , NK cells ( 7 ) , and neuronal cells ( 8 ) .
Although most studies have focused on characterizing its role in the transcription of genes that regulate the immune system ( 9 ) , NF-AT also influences other processes such as cardiac development ( 10 , 11 ) .
Four family members , NF-ATp ( NF-AT1 ) ( 12 ) , NF-ATe ( NF-AT2 ) ( 13 ) , NF-AT3 ( 14 ) , and NF-AT4/x/c3 ( 14-16 ) , have been described .
Three of the four NF-AT genes also give rise to multiple isoforms .
Family members are defined by related DNA binding domains and conserved sequence motifs , including several serine/proline-rich regions that appear to regulate the nuclear localization of these factors ( 17-19 ) .
All NF-AT proteins also appear to be a molecular target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 ( for a review , see Ref .
9 ) .

The existence of multiple NF-AT proteins that can recognize the same DNA element raises questions regarding their in vivo function .
The overlapping expression patterns of some of these proteins and their similar in vitro binding and frans-activation activities on promoter elements of NF-AT-regulated genes argue that these factors are largely redundant .
However , several lines of evidence support the idea that family members may also have cell-specific and/or gene-specific activities .
1 ) Outside the regions of high ho-mology , the NF-AT family members have quite diverse sequences , providing the opportunity for interaction with unique cofactors required for the transcription of a subset of NF-AT-regulated genes .
2 ) Tissue-restricted expression of some individual family members and their isoforms has also been observed .
For example , NF-AT3 is expressed at very low levels in the thymus , whereas NF-AT4 is strongly expressed at this site ( 14-16 ) .
Likewise , isoforms of NF-AT3 show distinct expression patterns : the 3-kb form is expressed predominantly in the placenta , lung , kidney , testis , and ovary , and the 4.5-kb form is expressed in the heart and colon ( 14 ) .
3 ) Recent studies using antisera that can distinguish family members reveal the existence of NF-AT binding specificity .
Timmerman et al .
showed that while NFE-AT1 and NF-AT2 can bind equally well to either the IL-2 or IL-4 promoter in in vitro DNA binding assays , NE-AT3 and NE-AT4 exhibit at least a 10-fold lower affinity ( 20 ) .
Similarly , NF-ATx was shown to be the major component of IL-2 promoter DNA-protein complexes in double-positive thymocytes ( 21 ) .
The most compelling argument for gene-specific activities of NF-AT comes from the phenotypic analysis of NF-ATp- and NF-ATc-deficient mice .
Stimulated T lymphocytes from NF-ATe '~ mice have an impaired ability to produce IL-4 ( 22 , 23 ) .
The production of Ig isotypes associated with Th2 responses is also diminished ( 22 ) .
Expression of other NF-AT-regulated genes in T cells , such as IL-2 , was only slightly affected .
These data demonstrate that IL-4 gene expression is a specific target of regulation by NF-ATc ( 22 , 23 ) .
In contrast , although the kinetics of IL-4 expression by activated T cells are delayed in NF-ATp-deficient 0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology mice , IL-4 production is significantly enhanced overall compared with that observed in wild-type animals .
NF-AT4 '~ animals produce relatively normal amounts of Th1 and Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 , but positive selection of T cells is defective ( 22 ) .
These results suggest the possibility that IL-4 transcription is positively regulated by NF-ATc and is repressed by NF-ATp ( 24 , 25 ) .
In this study we provide evidence for cell-type specific expression of NF-ATe isoforms .
These studies were prompted by our earlier observation that the NF-AT-mediated regulation of IL-4 gene transcription in mast cells exhibits striking differences compared with that of T cell IL-4 transcription ( 2 ) .
Although the transcription of IL-4 in both cell types is dependent on an NF-AT site between -88 and -60 in the murine IL-4 gene , the protein-DNA complexes that form at this site are distinct .
Unlike the T cell IL-4 complex that also contains activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , these Jun/ Fos family members are not present in the mast cell NF-AT complex .
DNA affinity purification and Western blot experiments also revealed differences in the size and regulation of the mast cell NF-AT protein associated with this site .
These data suggested the possibility that this NF-AT was either a unique isoform or the product of a previously undescribed gene .
Our efforts to address this issue led to the isolation of several NFE-AT cDNA clones from a murine mast cell library .
Here we report the full sequence of two murine NE-ATe isoforms , designated NF-ATc.a « and -B .
Each form shows unique features in sequence and expression pattern compared with the previously described human NF-ATc genes ( 26 ) .
In addition , murine T and mast cells exhibit striking differences in the relative expression of NF-ATc .
« and NF-ATe.fB .
This is due in part to the different inducibilities of these isoforms in response to TCR- and FeeRI-mediated signaling .
The selective expression of NF-ATc isoforms may contribute to cell- and/or gene-specific transcription of molecules that function in inflammation and that have not been previously appreciated in knockout exper-iments .

cDNA cloning A murine mast cell cDNA library was constructed in the Agt11 ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA . )
vector .
Poly ( A ) * mRNA from stimulated ( ionomycin for 90 min ) CFTL15 mast cells ( 27 ) was used as the template for first-strand cDNA synthesis using both oligo ( dT ) and random hexamer primers .
The library was screened at low stringency ( 2 % SSC/0.5 % SDS at 55°C ) with a murine NF-ATp probe obtained by RT-PCR amplification of murine EL-4 T cell RNA .
The probe contained sequences corresponding to nucleotides 1038-1517 within the re ?
similarity domain ( RSD ) of NF-ATp ( 28 ) .
Positive clones were purified , and inserts were subcloned into pBluescript plasmids for further analysis .
Sequencing of both strands of the cDNA inserts was performed using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with reagents from U.S. Biochemical Corp. ( Cleveland , OH ) .
RNase protection analysis Total RNA samples from cell lines and murine tissues ( from unimmunized C3H/HeNCr mammary tumor virus ( MTV ) ~ mice ) were isolated using the RNA-STAT reagent according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Tel-Test , Friendswood , TX ) .
RNase protection assays were performed using NF-ATc.a « ( nucleotides 10-196 in the a sequence ) and NF-ATc.f ( nucleotides 15-161 in B sequence ) cDNA fragments as templates for the synthesis of antisense RNA labeled to high sp .
act .
with [ °P ] UTP ( Riboprobe kit , Promega , Madison , WI ) .
Full-length RNA probes were gel-purified and hybridized ( 5 X 10° cpm ) to 10 ug of total RNA overnight at 45°C in 40 mM PIPES ( pH 6.4 ) , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 80 % formamide in a total volume of 30 pl .
Samples were incubated for 1 h at 30°C after addition of 350 ul of digestion buffer ( 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , 5 mM EDTA , 300 mM NaCl , 0.14 pg of RNase T1 , and 1 pug of RNase A ) .
Proteinase 2821 K ( 5 ul of 10 mg/m !
stock ) and SDS ( 10 ul of 20 % solution ) were added and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C .
Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform , precipitated , resuspended in gel loading buffer , and analyzed by 6 % denaturing PAGE .
Densitometric quantitation of relative mRNA expression levels was performed using the National Institutes of Health Image program .
Northern blot analysis The murine tissue Northern blots were purchased from Clontech .
For analysis of expression in cell lines , 10 ug of total RNA or 2 ug of poly ( A ) * RNA was electrophoresed on a 1 % formaldehyde gel and transferred to nitrocellulose .
DNA probes were labeled by random hexamer priming and hybridized as described previously ( 29 ) .
The NF-ATe-specific probe corresponds to nucleotides 1162-1727 based on the NF-ATc.B sequence shown in Fig .
1 and contains a significant portion of the RSD .
The murine B-actin probe includes nucleotides 147-332 of the published sequence ( 30 ) .
The IL-4 cDNA probe corresponds to nucleotides 40-412 ( 31 ) .
Cells CFTL15 is an IL-3-dependent murine mast cell line derived from fetal liver cells and was previously described ( 27 ) .
Bone marrow-derived mast cells ( BMMC ) were isolated from BALB/c bone marrow cultured in IL-3 and stem cell factor .
After 4 wk the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for the surface expression of c-Kit and FceRI .
The c-Kit levels were determined using directly conjugated anti-CD117-phycoerythrin ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) .
Expression of the high affinity Fee was assessed using a two-step staining procedure .
Cells were first incubated with purified mouse IgE ( Sigma ) .
After three washes , a second IgE bound to FeeR was detected using a rat anti-mouse IgE-FITC Ab ( PharMingen ) .
Data were acquired on a FACS caliber flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) gating on propidium iodide-negative cells .
Data were analyzed using CellQuest software ( BDIS ; Becton Dickinson ) .
P815 and ABFTL3 are transformed mast cells that express IL-4 mRNA constitutively ( 29 ) .
EL-4 is a murine thymoma line ( 32 ) that was obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) .
DO11.10 Th1 and Th2 cell lines were derived from the OVA-specific TCR transgenic mouse ( 33 ) .
M12.4.1 B cells were a gift from Dr. Paul Rothman ( 34 ) ; L929 fibroblast cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and have been previously described ( 35 ) .
Mast cells were activated by culturing with the calcium ionophore , ionomycin ( 1 pg/ml ; Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) or by cross-linking the high affinity FeeR by priming the cells with 1 pg/ml purified anti-DNP IgE ( Sigma ) for 2 h followed by activation with 5 ug/ml DNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( Calbiochem ) .
In some experiments mast cells were cultured for 2 days with IgE before stimulation .
T cells were stimulated with 1 ug/ml ionomycin and 20 ng/ml PMA ( Sigma ) or with Ag ( 2.5 X 10 % /ml BALB/c spleen cells , 10* U/ml IL-2 , and 0.5 uM OVA ; , , 43 , peptide ) for the indicated periods of time .
Results Murine NF-ATc cDNAs encode a and B isoforms that differ only at their N-termini To identify NF-AT genes expressed in mast cells , a cDNA probe derived from the murine NF-ATp RSD was used to screen both oligo ( dT ) - and random hexamer-primed CFTL15 murine mast cell libraries at low stringency .
Approximately 1.6 X 10° plaques were screened .
Several clones were characterized , including one that corresponded to NF-ATp .
The majority of the cDNAs analyzed were homologous to human NF-ATe.f , an isoform identified in Raji B cells ( 26 ) .
The longest clone is comprised of 3435 nucle-otides , which includes an approximately 1.3-kb 3 ' untranslated region ( 3 ' UTR ) that is unrelated to the 3'UTR of human NF-ATe ( Fig .
1 ) .
Within the coding region , this cDNA exhibits > 83 % identity overall at the DNA level with the human gene ( Fig .
24 ) .
The cDNA encodes a protein of 704 amino acids ( aa ) with a predicted molecular mass of 70 kDa .
A comparison of amino acid sequences reveals that NF-ATc is highly conserved in human and mouse .
There is 96.7 % identity and 98 % similarity within the RSD ( en-coded by aa 408-684 ) , which contains the DNA binding domain .
The amino-terminal region ( aa 1-407 ) contains three serine/pro-line ( SP ) motifs and is 83 % identical and 91 % similar to its human NF-ATc.B homologue .

In addition to the B isoform of NF-ATe , cDNAs encoding the murine NF-ATc .

It is notable that unlike the human cDNAs that encode isoform-specific amino acids at both the N- and C-terminal portions of the proteins ( 26 ) , the differences between murine NF-ATc .
« and -B were limited to the 5 ' end .
In NF-ATc.a cDNAs , sequences specifying the first 27 aa of NF-ATe.B are replaced by nucleotides that can potentially encode 39 a isoform-specific amino acids ( Fig .
2B ) .
The remainder of the cDNA sequence is identical with the 3 isoform .
While there is an in-frame AUG codon within this sequence , we were unable to obtain additional 5 ' sequence encoding an upstream me-thionine using several approaches .
These include rapid amplification of 5° cDNA ends ( RACE ) , direct screening of the cDNA library with a murine NF-ATc .
« probe , and RT-PCR using murine T and mast cell cDNA and primers derived from the murine NFATc common region and the human NF-ATc.a « 5'UTR .
However , it is likely that these sequences exist .
A recent report indicates that , like the human a isoform , a murine homologue isolated from T cells contains nucleotides that specify an additional 3 aa ( 36 ) .
These sequences include an in-frame AUG codon in a context that is suboptimal for protein translation initiation ( cggAUGc ) ( 37 ) .
This upstream AUG is used for the translation initiation of a minor NF-ATc protein species in human T cells .
Our clones contain the downstream AUG , which lies in an optimal context ( accAUGa ) and initiates the major form of human NF-ATc .

A comparison of the murine and human « -specific sequences shows that they share 80 % identity and 80 % similarity ( Fig .

The sequences were aligned as described in A. peripheral blood leukocytes ( 26 ) .
In murine tissues , probes derived from both the 5 ' region ( not shown ) and the RSD ( Fig .

Levels of murine NF-ATe RNA are highest in spleen , lung , and skeletal muscle .
Detectable , but much lower , expression was observed in heart , brain , liver , and kidney .
There was no detectable expression in mouse testis , unlike results reported for human NF-ATc .
A variety of T and mast cell lines were also analyzed for expression under resting and activated conditions .
As shown in Fig .
3B , mRNAs of several sizes were observed .
An approximately 4.5-kb band is the predominant species in both cell types and appears as an apparent doublet in mast cell lines .
Consistent with studies in human cells demonstrating that NF-ATe expression is dependent on cell activation , no mRNA was detected in unstimulated T cells ( 13 ) .
Several minor species appear to be expressed exclusively in mast cells .
At least two mRNAs of about 3.0 kb were detected in activated mast cell lines .
An additional 2.0 kb inducible mRNA was present in BMMC and P815 mast cells .
Unstimulated L929 fibroblast cells and M12.4.1 B cells do not express detectable NF-ATe mRNA ( data not shown ) .
NF-ATc.a and -B mRNA are differentially expressed Results from Northern analyses are consistent with the idea that there is cell- and tissue-specific expression of NF-ATe isoforms .
RNase protection assays were performed using probes that can distinguish between the a and B isoforms of NF-ATe to explore this possibility .
The integrity of the RNA in the samples was verified in parallel reactions using a B-actin probe ( data not shown ) .

T cells also express detectable basal levels of the 3 isoform mRNA .
However , activation through either the Ag receptor or with PMA/ionomycin has little effect on the expression of NF-ATc .
$ in these cells .
The transformed mast cell lines P815 and ABFTL3 as well as L929 and M12 B cells express very low levels of NF-ATc.B mRNA .
Detection of signals in these cells requires long autoradiograph exposure times .
These results indicate that induction of RNA encoding the two NF-ATc isoforms is differentially responsive to T and mast cell activation signals .
Steady state levels of NF-ATc isoforms are differentially regulated in activated T and mast cells The apparent differences in NF-ATe inducibility between these distinct cell types could be explained simply by cell-specific differences in the kinetics of activation .
To assess this possibility , T and mast cell lines were stimulated for various times , and total RNA was isolated for use in RNase protection assays .
As shown in Fig .
6 , maximal expression of NF-ATc.a was observed between 1 and 2.5 h , and then rapidly fell to undetectable levels in CFTL15 mast cells .
In the T cell lines tested , the maximal expression of the a isoform message was observed between 2 and 3 h. There were also notable time-dependent differences in the expression of NF-ATc.a in the T cell lines ; by 6 h poststimulation , little -specific RNA was detected in Th1 cells , whereas detectable amounts persisted for at least 24 h after stimulation in Th2 cells and for 48 h in EL-4 cells .
NF-ATc.B mRNA was significantly increased within 30 min of cell activation and remained high through 6 h poststimulation in CFTL15 mast cells .
The levels of NF-ATc.B mRNA remained unaffected by activation in all T cells .
These data confirm that the apparent differences in the inducible expression of NF-ATc.f in T and mast cell lines are not due to differences in the kinetics of NF-ATe mRNA 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology A CFTL15 - ABFTL3 P815 EL-4 Th2 Thi ’ lo !

« mRNA persistence in untreated ( _ ] ) and actinomycin D-treated mast cells ( added at 2 h poststimulation ; @ ) .
Relative mRNA levels from actinomycin D-treated CFTL15 mast cells ( Fig .
7 ) and untreated cells ( Fig .
6 ) were determined by densitometry as described above .
Values at each time point are expressed as a percentage of the maximum inducible level observed at 2 h poststimulation , the time of addition of actinomycin D. of the previously described human NF-ATc .
« and NF-ATe.f isoforms were isolated from a murine mast cell library ( 13 , 26 ) .
Like the human isoforms , the murine cDNAs are distinguished by isoform-specific sequences at the 5 ' end of the coding region .
These sequences are highly related to the human sequences .
Murine NF-ATc.a and NF-ATc.B cDNAs are otherwise identical and do not contain the isoform-specific differences in sequences 3 ' of the RSD that characterize the human sequences .
In fact , the murine sequences located 3 ' of the RSD are unique and share no homology at the DNA or protein level with human NF-ATc .
« and -B .
The murine NF-ATc.a DNA sequence reported here is similar , but not identical , with cDNAs derived from activated T cells reported by Pan et al .
( 36 ) .
In addition to the variants described in this report , it is likely that other NF-ATc isoforms exist .
Although RNase protection assays demonstrate that brain and liver do not express appreciable amounts of either form , a protected band corresponding to the sequences encoding the common region was observed ( Fig .
4 ) .
Similarly , several smaller mRNAs ranging in size from about 4.0 to < 2.0 kb were easily detected in P815 cells by Northern blot analysis ( Fig .
3B ) despite the lack of an - or -specific signal in these cells ( Fig .
5 , A and B ) .
A subset of these small mRNA species was also observed in normal mast cells , suggesting that they are not unique to transformed mast cells .
Western blot data likewise provide evidence for the existence of multiple protein isoforms of NF-ATe .
We previously described a single anti-NF-ATc-reactive species of approximately 56 kDa in unstimulated mast cells and two additional proteins between 120 and 160 kDa whose expression is activation dependent ( 2 ) .
In studies by Lyach et al .
, at least three proteins of distinct m.w .
were observed in activated T cells using NF-ATe-specific antisera ( 38 ) .
Whether these are generated by alternative splicing , the use of alternative promoters , or the selective utilization of translation start sites remains to be determined .
Why do multiple NF-ATc isoforms exist ?
We speculate that the unique regions of the NF-ATc isoforms confer distinct functions to these proteins .
Structure-function studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of NF-ATp ( aa 1-415 ) , human NF-ATc .
« ( aa 1-418 ) , and the N- and C-terminal domains of NF-AT ' x function as frans-activation domains ( 39-41 ) .
It is possible that unique domains act to attract unique coactivators .
In support of this theory is the finding that p300/CREB binding protein can be recruited by NF-ATp ( 39 ) .
In addition , we showed that AP-1 associates exclusively with the IL-4 promoter NF-AT complex in T cells but not in mast cells despite equivalent expression of these proteins in both cell types ( 2 ) .
Proteins such as c-Maf , NF-AT-interacting protein-45 , and GATA-3 , which have been described as essential cofactors for IL-4 gene expression in T cells , are also candidates for a role in cell type-specific coactivation ( 42-44 ) .
The existence of multiple isoforms that contain unique functional domains expands the potential repertoire of coactivators that can cooperate with NFATc to achieve selective gene expression in a given cell type .
Previous studies demonstrate that the regulation of NF-AT activity occurs at several levels ( for a review , see Ref .
9 ) .
All family members appear to undergo activation-dependent frans-location from the cytoplasm to the nucleus .
These events require the cal-cium-dependent phosphatase , calcineurin , which acts on cytoplasmic NF-AT through direct protein-protein interactions and allows the shuttling of NF-AT to the nucleus .
A nuclear kinase , glycogen 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology synthase kinase-3 , regulates the export of NF-AT back to the cytoplasm ( 19 ) .
Tissue-specific expression patterns of NF-AT family members and their isoforms also regulate the range of NF-AT-responsive genes that can be influenced in any given cell type ( 9 ) .
NF-ATp , NF-AT3 , and NF-AT4/x are constitutively expressed in target tissues and are not subject to control by cell activation signals .
In contrast , NF-ATce mRNA and protein expression are dependent on stimulation in human T cells ( 12 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 38 ) .
The results presented here demonstrate that additional levels of NF-AT regulation exist .
In murine T cells and mast cells , activation through the TCR or high affinity FeeR is absolutely required for the expression of NF-ATc.a .
In contrast , although the B isoform is expressed at low constitutive levels in most of the cell lines we analyzed , only the mast cells demonstrate a significant increase in steady state mRNA levels upon stimulation .
The clear-cut differences in expressions of the a and $ isoform mRNAs in response to activation signals support the hypothesis that distinct promoters responsive to T cell and/or mast cell activation signals contribute to the selective expression of these factors .
We also provide evidence that mechanisms exist to differentially regulate mRNA half-life .
Blocking transcription with actinomycin D prolongs the expression of NF-ATc .
« @ , but not -3 , in mast cells , indicating that an active destabilizing agent functions to down-regulate steady state mRNA levels .
The analysis of cytokine responses in NF-ATe-deficient mice demonstrates that this factor is responsible for IL-4 production in activated T cells ( 10 , 11 ) .
Our data support the idea that NF-ATc.a , but not -B , is involved in IL-4 transcription in Th2 cells .
This conclusion is based on the observation that NF-ATc .
is only minimally expressed in T cells and that the kinetics of NF-ATc .
« closely parallel the expression of IL-4 in these cells ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , cloning of NF-ATe from both human and murine T cells resulted in the isolation of cDNAs corresponding only to NF-ATc.a , indicating that this is the predominant NF-AT isoform expressed in this cell lineage ( 13 , 36 ) .
Because the mast cell population was not affected by NF-ATc gene targeting in NF-ATe '~ mice , its in vivo role in mast cell IL-4 gene transcription has not been addressed .
The current studies were initiated to identify the NF-AT factor ( s ) associated with the IL-4 promoter in mast cells .
However , the identity of this factor is still elusive .
DNA affinity purification experiments demonstrate that the major protein associated with the IL-4 NF-AT site between -88 and -60 is 41 kDa , a size not observed in analysis of anti-NF-ATc-reactive proteins by Western blot .
Furthermore , this protein was reactive with NF-ATp antisera , although the specificity/ cross-reactivity of both NF-ATp and NF-ATe antisera have not been rigorously tested .
Given the prevalence of both isoforms in mast cells as well as activation kinetics that correlate with IL-4 expression , it is likely that NF-ATc plays a role .
We are currently exploring the possibility that the shorter NF-ATe mRNAs encode this smaller protein associated with the IL-4 promoter in mast cells .
A better understanding of the NF-ATe chromosomal gene will allow the targeting of isoform-specific sequences to assess their roles in vivo .
