Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 ( STAT3 ) Is Constitutively Activated in Normal , Self-renew ing B-1 Cells but Only Inducibly Expressed in Conventional B Lymphocytes By James G.

STAT3 expression in particular has been associated with Abl , Src , and HTLV-1 transformation of normal cells .
B- 1 lymphocytes are self-renewing , CD5 * B cells that display a propensity for malignant transformation and are the normal counterpart to human chronic lymphocytic leukemias .
Further , B-1 cells are characterized by aberrant intracellular signaling , including hyperresponsiveness to phorbol ester PKC agonists .
Here we demonstrate that B- 1 lymphocytes constitutively express nuclear activated STAT 3 , which is not expressed by unmanipulated conventional ( B-2 ) lymphocytes .
In contrast , STAT 3 activation is induced in B-2 cells after antigen receptor engagement in a delayed fashion ( after 3 h ) .
Induction of STAT3 is inhibited by both the serine/ threonine protein kinase inhibitor H-7 and the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin and requires de novo protein synthesis , demonstrating novel coupling between slg and STAT proteins that differs from the classical paradigm for STAT induction by cytokine receptors .
The inability of prolonged stimulation of conventional B-2 cells with anti-Ig , a treatment sufficient to induce CD5 expression , to result in sustained STAT 3 activation suggests that STAT 3 is a specific nuclear marker for B-1 cells .
Thus , STAT 3 may play a role in B cell antigen-specific signaling responses , and its constitutive activation is associated with a normal cell population exhibiting intrinsic proliferative behavior .
he 67-kD pan-T cell surface glycoprotein , CD5 , was first detected on the surface of human and murine B cell tumors and subsequently found to specify a subset of normal B lymphocytes in both species ( 1 ) .
CD5¢* ( or B-1 ) B lymphocytes are mature B cells that predominate early in life , decline in relative number as the animal matures , and , in mice , become confined to the peritoneal cavity , with few , if any , present in the peripheral lymph nodes ( 2 ) .
Functionally , B-1 cells contribute a disproportionally large fraction of serum Ig , specifically of the pw , « , and y classes .
These Igs are noted to express germline encoded specifici-ties , with little somatic mutation and N-insertion and may be involved in the regulation of idiotype expression ( 3 , 4 ) .
B- 1 cells have been linked to both autoantibody production and the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease as well as malignancy ( 2 , 5 ) .
CD5 * B cells have been found to be enriched sources of autoantibody-producing cells specific for various self-antigens , and several mouse strains that develop 1035 autoimmune pathology have elevated numbers of splenic and peritoneal CD5 B cells ( 6 , 7 ) .
Adoptive transfer experiments have demonstrated that B- 1 cells have self-renewing capacity ( 8 ) , and in vitro , these cells are readily immortalized in culture without the use of exogenously induced transformation ( 9 ) .
Coupled with their hyperresponsiveness to PMA stimulation and their inability to enter S phase after slg cross-linking ( 10 , 11 ) , these observations suggest that B- 1 cells differ from B-2 cells in their biochemical makeup in ways that may contribute to autoantibody secretion and unregulated growth .

STAT signaling involves the activation of the JAK/ tyk family of tyrosine kinases that are believed to be associated with unliganded cytokine receptors and to phos-phorylate latent cytoplasmic STAT proteins upon ligand binding ( 14 ) .
Phosphorylated ST AT 's dimerize via interactions between their SH2 domains ( 15 ) , allowing nuclear translocation and DN A binding activity specific for distinct sequence elements in cytokine and growth factor-stimu-lated genes .
We have previously shown that mitogenic stimulation through surface Ig in B-2 cells induces the activation of STAT proteins ( 16 ) .
This observation , coupled with the association of STAT 3 with abnormal cell growth and transformation ( 17-20 ) , led us to compare the status and activational responses of STAT3 proteins in B-1 and B-2 cells .
O ur results indicate that the nuclear expression of activated STAT proteins differs between B-1 and B-2 cells and that the STAT protein profile may be a distinguishing molecular feature of the B- 1 cell phenotype .
Materials and Methods Animals .
- Male BALB/ cByJ mice at 8-14 wk of age were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) .
Mice were housed at least 1 wk before experimentation .
Mice were cared for and handled at all times in accordance with National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines .
B Cell Purification .
B-1 lymphocytes were prepared by negative selection from peritoneal wash-out cells as previously described ( 21 ) .
B-2 cells were purified from spleen cells of 8-12-wk-old naive mice by depletion of T cells using treatment with anti-Thy 1.2 antibody plus rabbit complement and depletion of macrophages by overnight culture on plastic petri dishes , as previously described ( 22 ) .
RBC and nonviable cells were removed by sedimentation over Lympholyte M ( Cedarlane , Ontario , Canada ) .
The resulting B cells were cultured at 37°C with 5 % CO ; in RPMI 1640 medium ( BioWhittaker , Walkersville , MD ) supplemented with 5 % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum ( Sigma Chem .
Co. , St. Louis MO ) , 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7.2 ) , 50 wM 2-ME , 2 mM 1-glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin , and 100 jwg/ ml streptomycin .
In some experiments , B- 1 cells were prepared in the presence of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 % bovine serum albumin and cultured in serum-free AIM-V medium ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
Nudear Extrads and Eledrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay .
_ Nuclear extracts from untreated or stimulated primary B cells were prepared using 430 mM NaCl at pH 7.9 as previously described ( 22 ) , except that 1 mM sodium orthovanadate was added to all extraction buffers .
Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method ( 23 ) ( Bio-R ad , Hercules , CA ) .
Nuclear extracted protein was incubated with P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the high-affinity SIE ( m67 ) derived from the c-fos gene ( 24 ) for 20 min before electrophoresis on nondenaturing 5 % polyacrylamide gels .
Binding reactions contained 1 jug poly ( dI-dC ) and 2.0 ug salmon sperm DN A .
For competition analysis , 20-fold excess unlabeled SIE or NF-AT oligonucleotide ( 25 ) was added to binding reactions before addition of nuclear protein and electro-phoresis .
Supershift/ immunoinhibition analysis was performed by addition of 1 pl anti-p91N or antiphosphotyrosine `` `` STAT1 for 1036 an additional 30 min at 4°C after the 20-min electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) binding reaction .
Westem Blotting .
Nuclear extracted protein ( 5 jug ) was resolved by 7.5 % SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked with 5 % nonfat powdered milk in wash buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7.6 , 0.14 M NaCl , and 0.1 % Tween-20 ; TBS-T ) overnight at 4°C .
The nitrocellulose filters were then probed with antiphos photyrosine `` `` STAT 1 ( 26 ) , or with antiphosphotyrosine `` `` `` STAT 3 antiserum , generated by immunization of rabbits with a synthetic peptide containing amino acids 696-709 of human STAT3 , with phosphotyrosine at position 705 , which was conjugated to bovine serum albumin .
Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with antibody in 3 % BSA-TBS-T. After washing , blots were developed by ECL .
Shift-W estem .
- EMSA was performed as described above except 5 jug of nuclear extracts were added to 1.5 % the normal amount of labeled oligonucleotide and electrophoresed on 5 % polyacrylamide gels .
SIE-binding proteins were separated from retarded labeled oligonucleotide by electrophoretic transfer from the native gel to nitrocellulose paper .
Labeled oligonucleotide was detected bound to DE-81 paper ( Whatman , Hillsboro , OR ) placed under the nitrocellulose filter and on top of Whatman filter paper .
After transfer , the nitrocellulose filters were blocked and Western blotted as above and the DE-81/ Whatman filters were dried for 10 min before autoradiography .
Reagents .
- F ( ab ' ) , fragments of goat anti-mouse IgM ( Jackson Immunoresearch , Inc. , West Grove , PA ) were used at a concentration of 15 g/ml .
PMA ( Sigma ) was used at 100 ng/ml .
Cells were stimulated with murine recombinant IFN-y ( 5 ng/ml ) or IL-6 ( 1,000 U/ ml ) , both from Genzyme ( Cambridge , MA ) .
R ab-bit antiserum to the NH , -terminal domain of p91 ( anti-p91N ) was the kind gift of Dr. C. Schindler ( Columbia University , New York ) .
Rabbit antiserum specific for only the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of STAT 1 was generated by immunization of rabbits with a peptide designed from the STAT 1a protein containing phosphorylated Tyr 701 ( 26 ) .
Rapamycin was used at 20 ng/ ml , dissolved in ethanol and 1- ( 5-isoquinolinesulfonyl ) -2-methylpiper-azine ( H-7 ) and N- ( 2'-guanidinoethyl ) -5-isoquinolinesulfonamide ( HA-1004 ) ( LC Laboratories , Woburn , MA ) were used at 25 M. Results and Discussion To determine whether the unusual growth characteristics of B- 1 cells are accompanied by differences in the regulation of STAT proteins , we compared STAT DNA-binding activities between resting B-1 and B-2 cells Nuclear extracts from untreated B- 1 cells formed protein-DNA complexes with the high-affinity sis inducible element ( SIE ) of the c-fos gene ( 27 ) , a recognized ST AT -binding site ( 1 ) , as detected by EMSA ( Fig .
1 A ) .
The major B- 1 cell-specific SIE-binding activity was observed to co-migrate with the IL-6-stimulated sis- inducible factor ( SIF ) A binding com-plex , with a smaller amount co-migrating similarly to the IFN SIF C complex ( 24 , 28-30 ) .
In contrast , no SIF A , and little SIF C activity was detected in nuclear extracts obtained from unmanipulated B-2 cells .
The B-1 cell complexes were competed by unlabeled SIE-containing oligonucleotide but not by the consensus binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) ( Fig .
1 B ) , indicating that these complexes are specific for the SIE .

1 C ) .
Antibody to the NH region of STAT 1a ( anti-p91N ) , which has been shown to recognize STAT3 induced by ciliary neurotrophic factor ( CNTF ) ( 31 ) , disrupted SIF A induced by IL-6 in B cells ( Fig .
2 A ) .
The constitutively expressed B-1 SIF A-like complex was also disrupted by anti-pI1N but not by an antibody to phosphotyrosine `` `` `` ST AT 1 ( Fig .
2 A ) .
Anti-p91N formed supershifted complexes with SIF A in both IL-6-stimulated B cells and untreated B-1 cells which were apparent in longer exposures and showed identical electrophoretic mobilities ; anti-sera to STAT 4 , 5 , or 6 failed to react with the B- 1 cell SIF A complex in EMSA supershift assays or with B-1 cell nuclear extracts in Western blotting experiments , and antibody that supershifted STAT1 activated by IFN-y immunoin-hibited/ supershifted only a small amount of the SIF C complex of B-1 cells ( data not shown ) .
Because ST AT3 is only known to form homodimers or to heterodimerize with STAT 1 , these results strongly suggest that B-1 cells differ from B-2 cells in the basal nuclear expression of STAT3 homodimers that comprise the SIF A nucleoprotein complex .
To assess the contribution of phosphorylated STAT3 to the SIF A complex constitutively present in B-1 cells , we performed Shift-Western experiments , using nuclear extracted protein , the SIE-containing oligonucleotide , and anti 1037 Karras et al .

Nuclear extracts from either unstimulated B- 1 or B-2 cells or from B-2 cells treated with IL-6 for 15 min were incubated with the SIE oligonucleotide before EMSA .
The SIF A complexes constitutively present in untreated B-1 cells and IL-6-treated B-2 cells were found to contain phosphotyrosine `` * `` STAT3 , as determined by immunoblotting material obtained from the native gel ( Fig .
2 B , bottom ) .
As a control , AT 3 electrophoresed in the absence of the SIE-containing oligonucleotide ( no DNA control ) was observed to migrate more slowly in the gel , distinguishing it from SIE-bound STAT 3 ( data not shown ) .
These results confirm that STAT3 is constitutively present in B-1 nuclei , as indicated by the su-pershifting experiments outlined above and show that it is present as a tyrosine phosphorylated protein in the SIF A complex .
We further examined the phosphorylation status of STAT3 in nuclear extracts from B-1 and B-2 cells CNTF has been reported to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of two STAT3 isoforms , p88 and p89 ( 31 ) .
These isoforms , whose phosphorylation is also inducible by IL-6 ( 29 , 32 , 33 ) , have been termed STAT3 ; ( p88 ) , for faster migrating and STAT 3 , ( p89 ) , for slower migrating ( 32 , 34 ) .
Immunoblotting with antiserum specific for STAT 3 phosphorylated on tyrosine `` showed that B-2 cells express little nuclear AT 3 , or STAT 3 , as expected on the basis of EMSA analysis ( Fig .

Antiserum specific for phosphorylated STAT 1 ( a-ptyrSTAT1 ) ( 26 ) was used as a control .

Nuclear extracted protein was analyzed by EMSA using the P-labeled SIE-containing oligonucleotide probe and 5 % nondenaturing PAGE .
Retarded radiolabeled oligonucleotide was separated from DNA-binding proteins by a Shift-Western pro-cedure , using electrotransfer to Whatman DE-81 paper and nitrocellulose filter paper , respectively .
The SIE-containing oligonucleotide was visualized by autoradiography and DNA-binding protein was immunoblotted with STAT3 phosphotyrosine ' `` -specific antibody and detected by ECL ( bottom ) .

Arrows indicate 91- and 84-kD isoforms of STAT 1 .
1038 nuclear extracts were found to contain roughly equal levels of phosphotyrosine `` * `` STAT3 , and STAT3 , , respectively , which co-migrated with IL-6-induced phosphotyrosine `` STAT3 from B-2 cells ( Fig .

In addition , immunoblotting untreated B-1 cell nuclear extracts with antibody specific for STAT 1 phosphorylated on tyrosine `` `` ' ( 26 ) detected activated STAT 1 of the p91 isoform , which was not present in nuclear extracts from untreated B-2 cells but was inducible by IFN-y treatment ( Fig .

Thus , the B-1-spe-cific expression of SIF A correlates with the presence of the phosphotyrosine `` forms of STAT 3 , and STAT 3 ; in nuclei from unstimulated B-1 cells , and B-1 cells also constitutively express a small amount of activated p91-ST AT 1 .
The presence of SIF A and AT 3 in B- 1 cells could not be due to macrophage contamination , because purified macrophages isolated by adherence during B cell purification from the same animals did not contain nuclear SIF A or AT 3 , and histologic examination of B- 1 populations revealed less than 2 % macrophage contamination ( data not shown ) .
Further , overnight incubation of B-1 cells with neutralizing antibody to IL-10 before preparation of nuclear extracts did not result in diminution of the SIF A complex observed by EMSA ( data not shown ) , suggesting that an IL-10 autocrine loop B alg 3h 5 £ - o- -t- a-ptyrSTAT1 r- & B 9 d C -- z UUU = - < li- -- Figure 3 .

Before stimulation , some B Wt ; - vs ts bi but 1039 Karras et al .
does not account for the observed elevated levels of STAT 3 in unstimulated B-1 cells and that constitutive STAT3 expression is intrinsic to this population .
Previous work has shown that anti-Ig treatment of B-2 cells results in STAT 1 activation ( 35 ) .
It has been suggested that B- 1 cells represent a population of conventional B cells previously activated through their antigen receptors .
For these reasons , STAT3 activation was evaluated in nuclear extracts from B-2 cells treated with anti-Ig .
Nuclear extracts from anti-Ig-treated B-2 cells formed a SIF A complex with the SIE similar to that observed in untreated B-1 cells , although this activity was only present in extracts from cells stimulated for 3 h or more ( Fig .
3 A ) .
As with B-1 SIF A , anti-p91N but not antiserum to phosphotyrosine `` `` `` ST AT 1 disrupted SIF A induced by anti-Ig in B-2 cells ( Fig .
3 B ) and formed a supershifted complex with SIF A that was visible in longer exposures and co-migrated with a similar complex recognized by anti-pI1N in IL-6-treated B cells ( data not shown ) .
Further , phosphotyrosine `` `` ST AT 3 , was detected by immunoblotting using nuclear extracts from B-2 cells treated for 3 h with anti-Ig , although little phos-photyrosine `` ST AT 3 ; was observed ( Fig .
4 A ) .
B cells stimulated with anti-Ig for less than 3 h did not contain nuclear AT 3 , or STAT 3 , ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that cross-linking slg in B-2 cells generates activated nuclear STAT 3 of predominantly the STAT 3 , isoform , much like IL-6 treatment of B-2 cells but dissimilar from the AT 3 profile of unstimulated B-1 cells , in which levels of STAT 3 , and STAT 3 ; are nearly equal ( Fig .
2 C ) .
Thus , constitutively expressed B-1 cell STAT 3 is not the same as STAT 3 induced in B-2 cells by sIg or cytokine receptor engagement .
The formation and transcriptional activity of cytokine-induced STAT3 complexes have been shown to require inducible serine phosphorylation ( 32 , 36 ) .
Because many slg triggered downstream events are PKC dependent , we tested whether anti-Ig induction of STAT3 in B-2 cells is sensitive to inhibition of serine/ threonine phosphorylation , using the inhibitor , H7 .
The induction of phosphotyrosine `` `` ST AT 3 , by anti-Ig was completely inhibited by H7 but not by treatment with ( the control analog ) HA1OO4 ( Fig .
4 A ) .
Preincubation with H7 but not with HA1004 cell cultures were pretreated for 30 min with CHX ( 10 g/ ml ) as indicated .
Nuclear extracted protein was size separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5 % gels followed by immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine `` `` STAT3-specific antibody , detected by ECL .
Arrows indicate fast ( p88 ) and slow ( p89 ) migrating forms of phosphorylated STAT 3 .
( D and E ) Rapamycin inhibits anti-Ig-induced activation of STAT 3 .
Primary B cells ( 1.5 X 10 `` ) were incubated in medium alone ( - ) or were stimulated with F ( ab ' ) , goat anti-mouse IgM ( 15 g/ ml ; alg ) for the indicated times , after which nuclear extracts were prepared .
Before stimulation , some B cell cultures were pretreated for 15 min with either rapamycin at 20 ng/ ml ( rapa ) or ethanol ( vehicle , VH ) .
Nuclear extracted protein was size separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5 % gels followed by immunoblotting with phos photyrosine `` ST AT 3-specific antibody , detected by ECL ( D ) .
The positions of molecular size markers and phospho-ST AT 3 ( wrrow ) are indicated .
Nuclear extracts were also analyzed by EMSA as described in Fig .
1 ( F ) .
Arrows indicate positions of nucleoprotein complexes containing SIF A , B , and C. also completely blocked the formation of the SIF A-binding complex in EMSA experiments conducted using nuclear extracts from B-2 cells stimulated with anti-Ig for 3 h ( Fig .
4 B ) .
These results suggest that nuclear localization of 3 , and the appearance of nuclear SIF A in B-2 cells stimulated by anti-Ig requires serine/ threonine phosphorylation and further implicate STAT 3 , in the composition of the anti-Ig-induced SIF A complex .
The delayed tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 after slg ligation in B-2 cells suggested that the synthesis of an intermediary protein is required for this response .
To test this possibility , B-2 cells were stimulated with anti-Ig in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ) and nuclear extracts were prepared .
CHX completely blocked the induction of phosphotyrosine `` `` ST AT 3 , in nuclear extracts from B-2 cells treated with anti-Ig for 3 h , whereas CHX had no effect on AT 3 stimulated by IL-6 ( Fig .
4 C ) .
CHX also abrogated the formation of the SIF A-binding complex in EMSA experiments performed using nuclear extracts from B-2 cells stimulated with anti-Ig for 3 h ( data not shown ) .
Thus , de novo protein synthesis is required for induction of both SIF A and of phosphotyrosine `` `` ST AT 3 , by anti- Ig .
Since anti-Ig is a mitogenic stimulus for B-2 cells , we reasoned that induction of STAT3 via this novel mechanism may be sensitive to immunosuppressive drugs that inhibit B cell proliferation , such as cyclosporin A , FK506 , and rapamycin ( 37 , 38 ) .
Immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracted protein showed substantial inhibition of anti-Ig-induced phosphotyrosine `` * `` ST AT 3 , by rapamycin ( Fig .
4 D ) .
Rapamycin also significantly blocked the formation of the anti-Ig-inducible SIF A complex ( Fig .
4 £ ) .
This effect of rapamycin is specific for slg-triggered STAT3 because induction of 3 by IL-6 was not affected by rapamycin ( data not shown ) .
Further , B-2 cell treatment with CsA had a minimal effect on nuclear expression of AT 3 , after anti-Ig stimulation but completely inhibited nuclear phosphotyrosine `` `` ST AT 3 , induced by the combination of PMA and the calcium ionophore , ionomycin ( data not shown ) demonstrating an additional level of specificity for the effect of rapamycin on anti-Ig-induced STAT 3 .
Both the delayed appearance and dependence on protein synthesis of in B-2 cells after anti-Ig stimulation raised the possibility that sig-mediated STAT3 induction may be due to the release of cytokines from the B cells themselves or from other contaminating cells in the B-2 cell preparation after treatment with anti-Ig .
To address this question , nuclear extracts from the mature B cell line BAL-17 were prepared and immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine `` ®ST AT 3 after stimulation with anti-Ig .
AT 3 , was induced in BAL-17 B cells by anti-Ig treatment with similar kinetics to that observed in B-2 cells ( data not shown ) ruling out a role for a factor secreted by a contaminating non-B cell .
In addition , culture supernatants from B cells stimulated by anti-Ig for 3 h were transfered to naive cells , from which nuclear extracts were prepared after 15 min and tested for the presence of 1040 B-2 B-1 E i w < 5 9 a - 2 +o + © - G © _ m in in in w of ojo T |m99¢9 © ® 6 =-u ‘ , -1— E u - < g-wat Figure 5 .

Supernatants from cultures treated with anti-Ig for 3 h did not induce appreciable rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 3 in previously naive cells ( data not shown ) , as would be expected of a cytokine-mediated response .
These results , coupled with the sensitivity of this response to rapamycin , which does not inhibit cytokine-mediated STAT signaling , suggest that the delayed tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 3 is specific to anti-Ig treatment and is not the result of cytokine release or synthesis triggered by cell activation .
Prolonged exposure of B-2 cells to anti-Ig ( e.g .
, for 2.5 d ) has been shown to result in the acquisition of surface CD5 expression and proliferative responsiveness to PMA ( 39 , 40 ) .
The possibility that prolonged slg crosslinking produces a B-1-like basal level of nuclear activated STAT3 was tested by treating B-2 cells with anti-Ig for several days before nuclear extraction .
Although B-2 cells treated with anti-Ig for 2.5 d responded to PMA by cell cycle progression to S phase , sig- mediated nuclear SIF A ( which was apparent at 3 h ) had disappeared by this time ( Fig .
5 ) .
This result indicates that STAT 3 induced by anti-Ig in B-2 cells is only transiently expressed , and thus long term T cell-inde-pendent type II ( TT-2 ) antigenic stimulation of B-2 cells does not recapitulate the profile of activated STAT 3 characteris tic of B-1 cells , despite inducing other B-1-like changes .
These results suggest that activated STAT 3 expression is an intrinsic and unique characteristic of B- 1 cells .
Activated STAT3 in B-1 Cells In conclusion , we have identified constitutive nuclear activated STAT 3 in normal murine B- 1 lymphocytes , representing the first nuclear transcriptional identifier for this developmentally regulated B cell population .
The B-1 cell subset has been linked to spontaneously arising B cell tumors , and STAT3 has been found to be activated in v-ab/-trans formed B cells HTLV-I-transformed T cells , and v-se transformed fibroblasts ( 17-20 ) .
Basal levels of nuclear phosphorylated STAT 3 may reflect , or may cause , the activated state of B- 1 cells , and may contribute to the self-renewing growth characteristics and the oncogenic potential of normal B-1 cells in vivo .
In contrast , both ege1 and c-myc mR N A levels do not differ between B-1 and B-2 cells ( 41 ) .
There has been considerable debate over whether B-1 cells are derived from a separate lineage of progenitor cells or represent B-2 cells that have undergone internal biochemical and external cell surface marker changes due to prior activational or differentiative responses , such as those delivered by TI-2 antigens ( 42 , 43 ) .
Our data suggest that one activity of slg cross-linking in conventional B cells is to activate STAT 3 , which occurs in delayed fashion , involves phosphorylation of tyrosine `` , and is dependent upon de novo protein synthesis , serine/threonine phosphorylation , and the participation of a rapamycin-inhibitable kinase .
Thus , the B cell antigen receptor is coupled to nuclear expression of activated STAT proteins ( this work and references 16 , 35 ) .
Notably , many features of this coupling stand in stark contrast to the accepted paradigm for STAT activation mediated by cytokine receptors , in which STAT phosphorylation occurs rapidly , does not require protein synthesis , and is independent of rapamycin-sensitive kinase activity .
However , the basal presence of both activated STAT 3 , and STAT 3 ; in unstimulated B- 1 cells contrasts with the transient induction of predominantly the STAT 3 , iso-form in anti-Ig stimulated B-2 cells and suggests that cross linking slg alone does not result in similar nuclear expression , in B-2 cells , of this activated transcription factor present in B-1 cells Therefore , constitutive B-1 cell STAT3 expression suggests that the development of these B cells can not be explained by TI-2 antigen-mediated influences alone , and that STAT proteins play a role in directing the unique behavioral and phenotypic characteristics of this population of normal cells .
