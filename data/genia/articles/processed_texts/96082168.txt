Salicylates Inhibit Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Transcriptional Activation of the Tissue Factor Gene in Human Monocytic Cells By Paul Oeth and Nige !
Mackman Binding of plasma Factor VIl/Vila to the tissue factor ( TF ) receptor initiates the coagulation protease cascades .
TF expression by circulating monocytes is associated with throm-botic and inflammatory complications in a variety of dis-eases .
Transcriptional activation of the human TF gene in monocytic cells exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide { ( LPS ) is mediated by binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a « B site in the TF promoter .
Here , we report that a family of anti-inflammatory agents , known as the salicylates , inhibited LPS induction of TF activity and TF gene transcription in human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells at clinically relevant doses .
Furthermore , sodium salicylate blocked the ISSUE FACTOR ( TF ) EXPRESSION initiates the coagulation protease cascades , which generates thrombin and leads to fibrin deposition . ``
Aberrant expression of TF is associated with a variety of clinical disorders such as atherosclerosis , `` rheumatoid arthritis , Gram-negative sep-sis , `` and various forms of cancer . ``
'' In Gram-negative sepsis , endotoxin-induced activation of blood coagulation plays a major role in the development of multiple organ failure by triggering disseminated intravascular coagulation . '
'' In rab-bits , disseminated intravascular coagulation is manifested by administration of TF or endotoxin and is blocked by treatment of the animals with anti-TF antibodies . ``
In a baboon model of lethal septic shock , an antihuman TF monoclonal antibody prevented coagulopathy and protected against le-thality , `` suggesting that TF plays a significant role in the pathology of this disease .
Monocytes are the only circulating cell type that can express TF . ``
In addition , these cells appear to be the primary source of TF expression in several animal models of sep-sis `` and in patients with septicemia . ``
Pentoxifylline , an agent that inhibits induction of TF expression in monocytes , `` `` `` `` has been shown to reduce endotoxin-mediated coagulation in chimpanzees .
'* Exposure of monocytes to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) rapidly induces TF gene expression .
'* `` * Our laboratory has identified a decameric « B site in the human TF promoter that mediates LPS induction of the TF gene in human monocytic cells . ``
We have shown that this kB site exclusively binds c-Rel/p65 heterodimers that are present in nuclear extracts of LPS-stimulated human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells . ``

to the TF « B site are required for transcriptional activation of the TF gene in monocytic cells . ``
The NF- « B/Re !
family of transcription factors includes p50 ( NFKB1 ) , p52 ( NFKB2 ) , p65 ( RelA ) , RelB , v-Rel , c-Rel , and the Drosophila maternal morphogen Dorsal . ``
Cloning of the genes for both p50 `` and p65 `` revealed a 300-amino acid region which showed a high degree of homology to a region in the proto-oncogene product c-Rel . ``
Family members can form homodimers and heterodimers , `` and different « B sites selectively bind these transcription factors . ``
'' For example , the TF gene is specifically regulated by a decameric KB site that binds c-Rel/p65 heterodimers , `` whereas expression of many other genes that are inducibly expressed in monocytes is regulated by p50/p65 heterodimers . ``
NF- « B/Rel family members are retained in the cytosol by the binding of a group of inhibitor proteins , including I « kBa . ``
Proteolytic degradation of IxBa is required for activation and nuclear translocation of p50/p65 and c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
Salicylic acid and its derivatives , commonly termed the salicylates , are a class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) administered in the treatment of many dis-eases . ``
'' `` `` The acetylated form of salicylic acid , acetylsalicylic acid ( commonly known as aspirin ) , is the most widely used member of the salicylates , which also include sodium salicylate ( NaSal ) , salsalate , diffunisal , and fendosal . ``
' The effectiveness of low doses of aspirin to reduce inflammation is due , in part , to its ability to inhibit the synthesis and release of prostaglandins by strictly limiting production of the cyclooxygenase prostaglandin H synthase . ``
' However , nonacetylated salicylates do not interfere with prostaglandin synthesis `` but are still effective anti-inflammatory agents when used at high doses in the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , `` `` `` suggesting that salicylates may reduce inflammation by other mechanisms .
Indeed , salicylates are able to inhibit the activation of neutrophils and prevent their cell-to-cell adhesion during the inflammatory process .
`` `` ** `` `` More recently , NaSal and aspirin were shown to inhibit NF- « B activation in human Jurkat T cells and mouse pre-B cells by preventing proteolytic degradation of IxBa . ``
In addition , these agents inhibited the transcriptional activation of the human immunodeficiency virus , presumably by blocking the nuclear translocation of NF- « B .
`` ° Thus , salicylates might control inflammation by inhibiting transcription of various genes encoding inflammatory mediators .

These results indicated that both nonacetylated and acetylated salicylates inhibited LPS-induced TF expression .
We next examined the effect of various doses of NaSal on LPS-induced TF activity .
Both PBMCs and THP-1 cells were pretreated for 15 minutes with NaSal ( 0.1 to 10 mmol/ L ) before LPS stimulation for 5 hours to maximally induce TF activity .
NaSal inhibited LPS induction of TF activity in PBMCs and monocytic THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Figs 2A and B ) .
Similar results were observed using aspirin and salsalate ( data not shown ) .
Time course experiments analyzed the effect of NaSal ( 10 mmol/L ) at different times ( 2 , 5 , 8 , and 24 hours ) after LPS stimulation .
These results showed that NaSal abolished LPS induction of TF activity at all time points examined ( data not shown ) , indicating that NaSal did not act by simply delaying the induction of TF expression .
The level of inhibition after the addition of NaSal at various times before and after LPS stimulation was also exam-ined .
LPS induction of TF activity was abolished by preincu-bating cells with NaSal ( 10 mmol/L ) for between 0 and 120 minutes before LPS stimulation ( Fig 3 ) .
In addition , longer preincubation times ( 60 to 120 minutes ) with lower concentrations of NaSal ( 0.5 to 1.0 mmol/L ) did not increase the level of inhibition ( data not shown ) .
However , there was a time-dependent loss of inhibitory activity when NaSal was added after LPS stimulation ( Fig 3 ) .
The inhibitory activity required the continual presence of NaSal because full LPS-induced TF activity was recovered when NaSal was removed before LPS stimulation ( data not shown ) .
The effect of NaSal was not a result of inhibition of procoagulant activity in the one-stage clotting assay , because this inhibitor had no effect 10 !

LPS induction of cell-surface TF expression in PBMCs was measured to determine if NaSal inhibited increases in TF protein expression ( Fig 4 ) .
PBMCs were pretreated with NaSal ( 0.1 and 10 mmol/L ) for 15 minutes before a 5-hour incubation with or without LPS ( 10 ng/mL ) .
LPS induction of TF expression was again inhibited in a dose-dependent manner , with complete inhibition at 10 mmol/L ( Fig 4 ) .
To exclude the possibility that inhibition by NaSal was due to toxicity , we examined protein incorporation of S-methionine and *S-cysteine in the presence of LPS and various concentrations of NaSal .
Incorporation of these radiolabeled amino acids into newly synthesized cellular protein is a general measure of protein synthesis within a population of cells .
PBMCs and THP-1 cells pretreated with NaSal and then stimulated with LPS showed no significant decrease in protein synthesis at any concentration of NaSal used in these experiments ( data not shown ) .
In addition , measurement of cell viability was assessed by MTS conversion to formazan via dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active cells using a calorimetric assay .
No reduction in cell viability was observed using LPS and NaSal ( data not shown ) .
Trypan blue cell counts also showed no significant reduction in cell viability ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , we observed no significant cell toxicity at the concentrations of NaSal and LPS used during the investigation .
NaSal inhibits LPS-induced TF mRNA expression .
We next examined if NaSal inhibited LPS induction of TF mRNA .

dose-dependent manner by NaSal ( Fig 5A ) .
To exclude the possibility that NaSal was a general trancriptional inhibitor of THP-1 cells , we analyzed PMA induction of another gene , egr-1 , which is regulated by a « B-independent mechanism .
The egr-1 gene expresses a nuclear phosphoprotein that binds to DNA in a zinc-dependent manner . ``
'' PMA induction of EGR-1 mRNA expression was not affected by NaSal ( 10 mmol/L ; see Fig 5B ) , indicating that NaSal was not acting as a general inhibitor of transcriptional activation in these monocytic cells .
NaSal inhibits LPS induction of TF gene transcription and the human TF promoter .
To determine if NaSal blocked LPS induction of TF gene transcription , nuclear run-on experiments were performed .
LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells transiently increased the rate of TF gene transcription at 1 hour ( Fig 6 ) .
This increase was abolished by pretreating the cells with NaSal ( Fig 6 ) .
Similarly , NaSal abolished the LPS-stimulated increase in TNF-a gene transcription ( Fig 6 ) , which is also regulated by proteins . ``
In contrast , the rate of transcription of the housekeeping gene , G3PDH , was not altered by LPS stimulation or NaSal and LPS ( Fig 6 ) .

SALICYLATES INHIBIT TISSUE FACTOR EXPRESSION To further analyze the NaSal inhibition of TF gene transcription , THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid , pTF ( -278 ) LUC , which contains 278 bp of the human TF promoter cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene , and a plasmid , p ( TF ) , SVLUC , which contains four copies of the TF « B site cloned upstream of the minimal simian virus 40 promoter expressing the luciferase gene .
Previous studies have shown that LPS induction of the TF promoter is mediated by an LPS response element ( -227 to 172 bp ) in the wild-type TF promoter or by tandem copies of the isolated TF « B site . ``

4150 IkBa protein in the cytosol 1 hour after LPS stimulation ( Fig 8B ) .
Similar results were observed in cells stimulated with LPS for 2 hours ( data not shown ) .
These results indicated that NaSal inhibited LPS induction of TF gene expression in human monocytic cells by preventing proteolytic degradation of IxBa protein and nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
To exclude the possibility that NaSal nonspecifically inhibited protein-DNA interactions , we analyzed the binding of EGR-1 to a prototypic EGR-1 site using nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells with or without NaSal .
THP-1 cells were pretreated for 15 minutes with NaSal ( 10 mmol/L ) before a 2-hour PMA ( 50 ng/mL ) stimulation .
EMSA showed that EGR-1 binding activity induced by PMA was not affected by the presence of NaSal ( Fig 8C ) .
Other NSAIDs , including salsalate , aspirin , ibuprofen , and indomethacin , were examined to determine if these agents also inhibited the activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
THP-1 cells were pretreated for 15 minutes with aspirin ( 10 mmol/ L ) , NaSal ( 10 mmol/L ) , salsalate ( 10 mmol/L ) , ibuprofen ( 200 mol/L ) , or indomethacin ( 25 pmol/L ) and then were stimulated with LPS ( 10 g/mL ) for 2 hours .
Aspirin , NaSal , and salsalate all abolished the nuclear translocation of c-Rel/ p65 heterodimers , whereas ibuprofen and indomethacin had no effect ( Fig 9 ) , which is consistent with the inability of ibuprofen and indomethacin to inhibit LPS induction of TF activity in monocytic cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
NaSal concentrations inhibiting 50 % of the LPS-induced TF expression in the different assays ( IC , , ) were 0.656 to 1.030 mmol/L ( Table 1 ) .
Differences in the ICs , may be caused by the different incubation times of these assays or may reflect variations in the sensitivity of each assay to inhibition by NaSal .
DISCUSSION This study showed that salicylates inhibited LPS-induced TF expression in human monocytic cells .
This inhibition was observed with NaSal , salsalate , and aspirin , indicating that both nonacetylated and acetylated salicylates share a common pathway in their ability to inhibit TF expression .
NaSal inhibited LPS induction of TF activity , TF mRNA , and TF gene transcription but did not prevent PMA induction of EGR-1 mRNA expression , indicating that it was not a general inhibitor of transcriptional activation .
In addition , NaSal inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
Other NSAIDs , such as ibuprofen or indomethacin , failed to inhibit LPS-induced TF activity or activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
Thus , salicylates suppressed LPS induction of the TF gene in monocytic cells by preventing activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers .
LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells has been shown to lead to phosphorylation of IxBa , with a corresponding activation of transcription factors containing c-Rel and p65 .
* ' We have shown that LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells transiently reduces levels of cytosolic IxBa protein® and that overex-pression of IxBa in THP-1 cells prevents LPS induction of TF gene transcription . ``
Here , we show that NaSal blocks activation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers in monocytic cells by preventing the LPS-induced proteolytic degradation of IkBa .

arthritis in which increased levels of TF are found in the synovium of patients . ``
In addition , TF protein and mRNA are expressed by macrophage-derived foam cells in atherosclerotic plaques . ``
Both of these diseases are treated clinically with salicylates ; therefore , the ability of salicylates to inhibit TF expression by monocytes may contribute to their efficacy and antithrombotic properties .
Cell surface expression of TF by monocyte/macrophages and secretion of various cytokines , including TNFa , are associated with the pathology of Gram-negative sepsis . ``
An effective clinical inhibitor of transcriptional activation of TF and cytokine genes could be useful in the treatment of sepsis .
In this study , we found that NaSal inhibited LPS-induced transcription of both the TF and TNFa genes in THP-1 monocytic cells .
Aspirin has previously been examined in rat and nonhuman primate models of endotoxemia with beneficial results `` `` ; however , no follow-up studies assessed its clinical use in sepsis therapy .
Another NSAID , ibuprofen , has been extensively studied in relation to sepsis therapy . ``

In contrast , endotoxin-induced elevation of the NF- « B-regulated genes interleukin-6 and TNFa were not decreased by ibuprofen administration . ``
Indomethacin , another NSAID , which ( like ibuprofen ) inhibits cyclooxygenase , was unable to inhibit transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus . ``
Our data and those of others `` show that ibuprofen and indomethacin failed to inhibit activation of NF- « B/Rel proteins , which is consistent with their inability to reduce transcription of NF- « B/Rel-regulated genes . ``
Sepsis is a complex pathological condi-tion `` that will most likely require a well-defined multiple-drug treatment for effective therapy .
Given the new findings in relation to the modes of action observed with salicylates , it seems their use in sepsis therapy should be reexamined .
NF- « B/Rel proteins regulate the activation of many genes that are induced during inflammatory responses , including genes encoding various cytokines and adhesion molecules . ``
LPS induction of these genes is mediated by « B binding sites . ``
'' Therefore , inhibiting the activation of NF- « B/Rel proteins , especially in monocytes , may account for many of the anti-inflammatory effects of the salicylates .
