, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation , Cleveland , Ohio 44195 ABSTRACT Recent data suggest that the poor induction of a T-cell response to human renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) may be related to alterations in signal transduction pathways .
We report that T cells from RCC patients have two alterations in xB motif-specific DNA-binding activity .
The first alteration involves the constitutive expression of substantial « B-binding activity in nuclear extracts , which was observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
The magnitude of xB activity in unstimulated patient T cells was similar to that observed in T cells from normal individuals that had been activated in vitro .
On the basis of Western blotting experiments using antibodies to xB/Rel family proteins , the « B-binding activity constitutively expressed in T cells from RCC patients is composed mostly of the NF-B1 ( p50 ) subunit .
The second abnormality in xB-binding activity in T cells from these patients is that RelA , a member of the Rel homology family which is part of the normal NF-B complex , was not induced in the nucleus following activation .
Western blotting analysis did not detect any RelA in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of T cells .
The altered « B-binding activity in T cells from RCC patients may impair their capacity to respond normally to various stimuli .
INTRODUCTION T cells represent an important component of the host immune response to tumors .
The activation and potentiation of T-cell immunity is a goal of many forms of cancer immunotherapy including cytokine and adoptive cell treatment ( 1-10 ) .
However , there is evidence documenting that T-cell immunity fails to develop or is suppressed in the tumor bearing host ( 11-13 ) .
Defects in delayed type hypersensitivity ( 14 ) , cytotoxicity ( 14 , 15 ) , proliferation ( 14 , 15-18 ) , and IL-2 `` production ( 14 ) have been reported in cancer patients .
In the murine colon tumor model MCA-38 , decreased T-cell cytotoxic activity is seen during tumor progression ( 19 ) .
Recent work in this model has documented that tumor-bearing mice are missing TCRZ , as well as the protein tyrosine kinases p56 `` and p59 `` ( 20 ) .
We have found similar alterations in these signaling elements in T cells from patients with RCC ( 21 ) .
Although changes in these molecules were observed with T cells from both the blood and tumor , tumor-derived lymphocytes were more severely affected .
Depressed levels of TCRZ were also observed in tumor-derived T cells from patients with colorectal carcinoma ( 22 ) .
Given the importance of TCR , p56 `` , and pS59® `` in T-cell activation ( 23 ) , defects in their expression may cause alteration in downstream signaling events including the activation and/or nuclear translocation of transcription factors ( 24 ) .
In this report we determined if alterations in signaling elements of Received 5/11/94 ; accepted 8/17/94 .

T cells from RCC patients include abnormalities in « B sequence motif-specific binding activity ( 25 ) .
The regulation of many cellular gene products associated with T-lymphocyte activation including cytokines and the IL-2Ra chain involves NF- « B .
The « B enhancer-binding proteins are composed of a family of related proteins that include NF- « B1 ( p50 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , and c-Rel ( 26-33 ) .
These proteins and other members of the « B/Rel family share amino acid sequence homology within a region that is responsible for DNA binding and dimerization ( 34 ) .
In T cells , NF- « B is inducible and is regulated at a posttranslational level ( 26 , 28 , 34 ) .
Stimulation of T cells with mito-gens , phorbol esters , anti-CD3 antibody , and certain cytokines such as IL-2 induces the release of the preformed cytoplasmic NF- « B complex from an inactive complex with an inhibitor , allowing the active form to translocate to the nucleus ( 26 , 34 , 35 ) .
The work presented here indicates that T cells from RCC patients have an abnormality in the expression of nuclear NF- « B .
This includes the constitutive expression of NF- « B1 and the failure to activate other members of the NF- « B family which are part of the normal complex found in the nucleus after stimulation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of T Cells from Peripheral Blood and Tumor .
TIL cells were isolated from surgical specimens from patients with renal cell carcinoma ( n = 13 ) participating in protocols at the Cleveland Clinic .
All TIL preparations were obtained from the primary tumor .
PBLs were obtained from 12 patients 3-5 days after their surgery .
Seven of the PBLs had paired TIL samples .
TILs were obtained from tumor after a 2-h digestion at 37°C using collagenase type II ( 3.5 mg/m } ; Sigma Chemical Co. ) and egg white trypsin inhibitor ( 1 mg/ml ; Sigma ) ( 18 , 21 ) .
TILs were centrifuged over Ficoll-Hypaque , and T lymphocytes were enriched by passing cells over a nylon wool column followed by negative selection ( magnetic cell separation ; Miltenyi Biotec Inc. , Sunnyvale , CA ) using the following microbead-conjugated monoclonal antibodies : anti-CD16 ( natural killer cells ) ; anti-CD19 ( B cells ) ; and anti-CD14 ( macrophages ) ( 21 ) .
PBL-derived T cells ( RCC patients , n = 12 ; normals , n = 7 ) were obtained following Ficoll-Hypaque density separation and negative selection using the same antibody mixture described for TIL ( 21 ) .
Immunostaining with anti-CD3 antibody after enrichment demonstrated that the T-cell purity was greater than 90 % .
Oligonucleotides Used in Assays .
The synthetic oligonucleotide containing a tandem repeat of the consensus sequence for the NF- « B DNA-binding site was obtained from GIBCO-BRL ( Gaithersburg , MD ) .
The sequence of the oligonucleotide was 5'-GATCCAAGGGGACTTTCCATGGATCCAA-GGGGACTITCCATG-3 ' .
The oligonucleotide corresponding to the « B element from IL-2Ra gene was prepared by using an Applied Biosystems oligonucleotide synthesizer ( Model 381 A ) .
The sequence of the oligonucleotide was 5'CAACGGCAGGGGAATCTCCCTCTCCTT-3 ' ( 28 , 35 ) .
Underlined sequences represent the « B motif .
In the competition studies an oligonucleotide corresponding to the Oct enhancer element was used ( GIBCO-BRL ) , and the sequence is 5'GATCATGCAAATGATCATGCAAATGATCATGGA-AAT-3 ' .
For the preparation of probes in electrophoresis mobility shift assay , radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing coding strand template to a complementary 10-base primer and filling in the overhang with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [ « -P ] dCTP .
Preparation of Nuclear Extract .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modified method of Osborn et al .
( 36 ) .
Isolated T cells ( 10 ' ) were washed 5424 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

ALTERED « B BINDING ACTIVITY IN T CELLS twice with cold Hanks ' balanced salt solution and the cell pellet was suspended in 40 pl of hypotonic buffer A [ 10 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) -10 mm KCl-1.5 mm MgC1 ; -0.1 mm EDTA-1 mm DTT-0.5 mm PMSF-0.1 % Nonidet P-40 } for 10 min on ice .
Nuclei were prepared by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4°C .
The nuclear pellet was suspended in 15 ul of buffer C [ 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) -25 % glycerol-0.4 m NaCl-1.5 mm MgCl , -1 mm EDTA-1 mm DTT-0.5 mm PMSF ] and incubated for 15 min at 4°C with brief mixing .
The mixture was microcentrifuged ( 16,000 x g ) for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was diluted with 60 pl of modified buffer D [ 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) -50 mm KCI-0.2 mm EDTA-1 mm DTT-1 mm PMSF ] .
Protein concentration was measured by using the Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay .
As previously described ( 37 ) , nuclear extracts ( 5 ug of protein ) were preincubated in a 25-pl total reaction volume containing 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 80 mm NaCl , 0.1 mm EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 8 % glycerol , and 2 ug of poly ( didC ) ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) for 15 min at 4°C .
The reaction mixture was then incubated with the radiolabeled oligonucleotide ( 2 X 10° cpm ) for 20 min at room temperature .
The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6 % nondenaturing polyacryl-amide gel with 0.25 X TBE buffer ( 22.3 mM Tris-22.2 mm boric acid-0.5 mm EDTA ) .
The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography .
Western Blotting .
The antibodies used in these experiments were poly-clonal rabbit anti-mouse antibodies to NF- « B1 ( p50 ) and RelA ( p65 ) ( kindly provided by Dr. Ghosh , National Cancer Institute , Frederick , MD ) .
Normal rabbit serum ( 2 pg/pul ) ( The Jackson Laboratory , West Grove , PA ) was used as a control .
T cells were lysed by incubation in lysis buffer for 10 min on ice .
Equal amounts ( 10 ug ) of nuclear protein from cell lysates were electrophoresed on 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes .
The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline-Tween ( 0.1 % ) with 5 % nonfat dried milk overnight at 4°C or 2 h at room temperature and then blotted for 1-2 h with the appropriate antibody .
The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline-Tween and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Thereafter , membranes were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents ( DuPont New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) and exposed to film .
RESULTS T-cell Nuclear Extracts from RCC Patients Display Altered « B-specific Binding Activity .
We determined whether the defects in T-cell-signaling elements from RCC patients involved abnormal « B-specific DNA-binding activity .
To address this question , T cells were cultured in medium alone or with one of the following stimuli ; IL-2 ; cross-linked anti-CD3 antibody ; or both .
After 4 h of incubation nuclear extract was isolated since kinetic studies from our laboratory and others ( 35 ) have shown that maximinal levels of NF- « B are detectable in the nucleus at this time .
Nuclear extracts from tumor and peripheral blood derived T cells were reacted with a { °°P ] dATP-radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing tandem repeats of the « B recognition sequence .
The DNA-protein complexes were separated from free oligonucleotide by nondenaturing acrylamide gel electro-phoresis .
The nucleoprotein complex obtained with T cells from RCC patients was compared to that from T cells of healthy volunteers .

ALTERED « B BINDING ACTIVITY IN T CELLS While IL-2 or cross-linked anti-CD3 antibody treatment resulted in activation of « B-binding activity in PBL from normal volunteers , T cells derived from the blood or tumor of RCC patients constitutively express « B-binding activity ( Fig .

Unstimulated T cells from patients contained a DNA-protein complex which was comparable in magnitude to that observed with activated T cells from normal individuals that were stimulated in vitro ( Fig .
1 ) .
The DNA-protein complex from tumor-derived T cells had a slightly faster mobility than the complexes from autologous peripheral blood T cells and from activated T cells of normal individuals .

Altered « B-binding activity is a consistent finding in TIL and PBL from RCC patients .
Results from four experiments are presented where each experiment represents electrophoresis mobility shift assays performed on nuclear extracts from different patients and normal volunteers .
In experiments 1 , 3 , and 4 , T cells were stimulated with cross-linked anti-CD3 , whereas in experiment 2 , T cells were stimulated with IL-2 ( 1000 units/ml ) .
In all experiments nuclear extract was obtained after 4 h of stimulation .
Nuclear extract from T cells cultured in medium alone was used to define the level of xB-binding activity of unstimulated T cells .

Altered xB-binding activity is seen in T cells from B-cell lymphoma patients .
T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood and involved lymph nodes of a patient with non-Hodgkin 's B-cell lymphoma ( diffuse large noncleaved cell ) by negative selection using antibodies to CD19 ( B cells ) , CD56 ( natural killers ) and CD14 ( macrophages ) .
T cells were cultured in medium alone or stimulated with IL-2 ( 1000 units/ml ) for 4 h. Thereafter , electrophoresis mobility shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts and the radiolabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the xB sequence of the /L-2Ra gene .
Where indicated , 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added as a competitor for the radiolabeled probe .
Similar results were obtained with nodal T cells derived from two additional B-cell lymphoma patients ( data not shown ) .
+ , indicates stimulation of T cells and/or the addition of competitor to EMSA .
with IL-2 or anti-CD3 did not result in any increase in the intensity of the DNA-protein complex .
We then determined whether the DNA-protein complex detected in unstimulated T cells from RCC patients was also observed , using a « B sequence probe from the ZL-2Ra gene .
A complex similar to that seen with the « B consensus sequence was also observed , indicating that the difference was not related to the specific motif used as a probe ( Fig .
1 , B and C ) .
The sequence specificity of the binding activity was demonstrated by performing competition studies with 100-fold excess unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the « B sequence or an unrelated sequence [ Oct ( Fig .
1 ) or CRE ( not shown ) ] .
These alterations were observed in TIL and PBL from 13 and 12 renal patients , respectively .
Data from four experiments are presented in Fig .
2 , where each experiment represents nuclear extract derived from a different patient and normal healthy volunteer .
The possibility that nuclear « B-binding activity in unstimulated T cells from RCC patients was the result of cell isolation or culturing procedures was also examined .
A comparison was made between the level of « xB sequence-binding activity in freshly isolated T cells to that in T cells that had been incubated in medium alone for 4 h. Comparable levels of NF-KB complexes were detected from both T cell populations , suggesting that short-term culture did not account for the presence of « B-binding activity in unstimulated T cells from RCC patients ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , the enzyme solution used to obtain T cells from the tumor did not appear to induce NF- « B nuclear translocation since nuclear « B-binding activity was not detected after enzymatic treatment of peripheral blood T cells obtained from normal individuals ( data not shown ) .
We also determined whether T cells derived from a different type of tumor would have similar alterations in « B-binding activity .
For these experiments , T cells were isolated from involved lymph nodes 5426 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

T cells from RCC patients fail to express RelA ( p65 ) in the nucleus after stimulation in vitro .
( A ) T cells from the peripheral blood of a RCC patient and a healthy donor were incubated in vitro for 4 h in either medium alone ( m ) or with the stimulus ( s ) , IL-2 ( 1000 units/ml ) plus cross-linked anti-CD3 antibody .
Thereafter , cells were lysed and equivalent amounts of nuclear protein ( 15 ug ) were run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels .
Western blotting was then performed using anti-bodies to NF- « B1 ( p50 ) and RelA ( p65 ) as described in `` Materials and Methods . ``
( B ) Similar results were obtained with TIL from another RCC patient .
For comparison are results from T cells isolated from a healthy donor ( different than the one presented in A ) of patients with non-Hodgkin 's B cell lymphomas ( n = 4 ) by negative selection .
Substantial « B-binding activity was observed in nuclear extract from nonmalignant T cells derived from the B cell lymphoma patients .
Stimulation with IL-2 or anti-CD3 antibody did not increase the magnitude of the complex detected by electrophoresis mobility shift assay ( Fig .
3 , representative data ) .
These results demonstrate that altered « B-binding activity is present in another tumor type .
Whether abnormal « B-binding activity is a common feature of T cells from patients with cancer will require analysis of T cells from multiple histological types of tumors .
Characterization of the « B-specific Binding Proteins in T Cells of RCC Patients .
Western blotting was performed to identify which of the « B-specific binding proteins are present in nuclear extracts of T cells from RCC patients before and after stimulation .
To detect NF- « B1 and RelA in nuclei , T cells were cultured in medium alone or with cross-linked anti-CD3/IL2 ( stimulus ) for 4 h. Both NF- « B1 and RelA were present in nuclear extracts from T cells of healthy individuals , and their levels increased significantly after in vitro stimulation ( Fig .
4 ) .
In contrast , T cells from the peripheral blood and tumor of RCC patients expressed abundant NF- « B1 in the absence of in vitro stimulation ( Fig .
4 , A and B , Lanes m ) and this level did not increase after T-cell activation ( Fig .
4 , A and B , Lanes s ) We found no expression of RelA in T-cell nuclear extract of RCC patients before and after activation by Western blotting .
However , Western analysis of cytoplasmic extract from the same samples demonstrated that RelA was present but not translocating to the nucleus after stimulation ( data not shown ) .
Similar results were observed with T cells from the peripheral blood of 4 other RCC patients ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION The results presented here show that T cells from patients with renal cell carcinoma have alterations in « B-specific DNA-binding activity as compared to T cells from the peripheral blood of normal individuals .
Substantial « B-binding activity is detected in these cells in the absence of stimulation and this complex is composed mostly of NF- « B1 ( p50 ) .
Stimulation with either IL-2 or anti-CD3 antibody did not induce nuclear expression of RelA ( p65 ) .
Therefore , in patient T cells there is no induction of a normal NF- « B complex ( p50/p65 ) after in vitro stimulation .
The presence of substantial « B-binding activity in nuclear extracts from T cells of RCC patients without prior stimulation is distinct from what is normally observed with T cells from healthy individuals where little or no binding activity is detected in the absence of stimulation ( 35 , 38 ) .
The constitutive expression of « B-binding activity in T cells from the peripheral blood and tumors of these patients suggests that the abnormal expression of « B activity represents a generalized event which affects much of the host T-cell population .
We also noticed in the majority of experiments that the « B-binding complex isolated from TIL migrated faster than the complex from PBL of RCC patients .
What accounts for the difference in migration rate is not known since NF- « B1 is the predominant DNA-binding protein isolated from both sources of T cells ( Fig .
4 and data not shown ) .
Previous studies have reported NF- « B1 expression in resting lymphocytes and in certain T cell lines ( 35 , 39 , 40 ) .
NF- « B1 in the nucleus of T cells may translate into suppression rather than induction of gene expression .
In a nontransformed CD4* T-cell clone the expression of NF- « B1 homodimers in the nucleus was associated with suppression of IL-2 transcription ( 40 ) .
Following antigen stimulation the induction of IL-2 gene expression correlated with a reduction in NF- « B1 homodimers and a concomitant increase in the NF- « B1/ReIA heterodimer ( 40 ) .
In addition , overexpression of NF- « B1 in T cells has been shown to repress IL-2 promoter activity ( 40 ) .
Whether the increase in nuclear NF- « B1 suppresses gene expression following antigen stimulation remains to be determined .
Our findings demonstrate that at least one member of the Rel homology family was not inducible in T cells from the RCC patients .
Unlike activated T cells from normal individuals , T cells from RCC patients had little or no detectable RelA ( p65 ) in their nuclear extracts after stimulation .
Whether other members of the « B/Re !
family proteins such as c-Rel ( 41 ) are expressed in the nucleus of T cells from RCC patients after in vitro stimulation remains to be determined .
The mechanism ( s ) responsible for the inability to induce « B-binding activity is not known but may relate to defects in upstream signaling elements ( 34 ) .
The release of NF- « B from IxBa in the cytoplasm and the translocation of xB-binding activity into the nucleus may involve the phosphorylation of IxBa ( 34 , 42 ) .
In vitro studies demonstrate that the phosphorylation of IxBa is mediated by PKC ( 34 , 42 ) .
Moreover , protein tyrosine kinases associated with the TCR/CD3 complex are linked to PKC activation in that they are responsible for the phosphorylation of phospholipase C-y1 ( 23 , 43 ) .
The activation of phospholipase C-y1 causes the hydrolysis of phos-phatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate , resulting in the formation of dia-cyglycerol which in turn activates PKC ( 43 ) .
We have demonstrated that T cells from RCC patients are missing TCRCL , p56 `` , and p59 `` ( 21 ) .
* The absence of these signaling elements in T cells may prevent normal activation and the phosphorylation of IxBa , thus inhibiting the translocation of p50/p65 complex into the nucleus .
This possibility is supported by Western blotting experiments where we have demonstrated that while RelA does not translocate to the nucleus following activation of patient T cells , it is present in the cytoplasm along with IxBa ( data not shown ) .

ALTERED « B BINDING ACTIVITY IN T CELLS The constitutive expression of high levels of NF- « B1 and failure to induce other members of the « B/Rel family of proteins following the stimulation of T cells from RCC patients may have a negative impact on T-cell function .
We reported previously that TIL from patients with RCC have a proliferative defect when compared to peripheral blood T cells ( 18 ) .
However , the proliferative defect of TIL may not be related to the altered expression of « B-binding activity since the inducibility of « B-binding activity is reversible after in vitro culture , whereas the defect in proliferation is not ( 18 ) .
Moreover , the proliferative defect is present in TIL but not PBL , whereas T cells from both sources display altered « B-binding activity .
It may be that the altered « B-binding activity is related to depressed production of cytokines .
Re-cently , it was reported that splenic T cells from mice bearing the renal cell carcinoma line RENCA have altered expression of the « B/Rel family of proteins , which correlated with reduced expression of IFN-y mRNA ( 44 ) .
The abnormal « B-binding activity in TIL from RCC patients is consistent with no or infrequent expression of cytokine mRNA ( IL-2 or IFN-y ) ( 45 ) or IL-2Ra mRNA ( 18 ) , which is usually associated with T-cell activation .
However , when activated in vitro , TIL from RCC patients are capable of producing IL-2 and IFN-y , although the level of production may be low relative to T cells from normal individuals ( 46 ) .° Additional studies to measure the rate of IFN-y ( and IL-2 ) gene transcription between T cells from normal individuals and RCC patients are needed to determine whether the alterations in « B-binding activity are related to impaired cytokine production .
