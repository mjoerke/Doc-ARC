The aim of this study was to examine the ability of tumor necrosis factor « ( TNFa , a proinflammatory cytokine ) and interleukin ( IL ) -10 ( an anti-inflammatory cytokine ) to differentially regulate the sensitivity of human monocytes/macrophages to glucocorticoids .
To accomplish this , we first analyzed the pattern of TNFa and IL-10 inhibition by dexamethasone in LPS-stimulated whole-blood cell cultures .
Second , we studied the modulation of the sensitivity of these cells to dexamethasone by preincubation with TNFa or IL-10 and measurement of LPS-stimulated IL-6 secretion .
In addition , we evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on phorbol-myristate-acetate-stimulated IL-1 receptor antagonist secretion by the human monocytic cell line U9837 .
Finally , we investigated whether the modulation of corticosensitivity in TNFa « - and IL-10-pretreated U937 cells was related to a change of the glucocorticoid receptor concentration and affinity .
Dexamethasone had different effects on LPS-induced TNFa and IL-10 secretion ; whereas it suppressed TNFa in a dose-dependent fashion , its effect on IL-10 secretion was biphasic , producing stimulation at lower , and inhibition at higher doses .
The concentration of LPS employed influenced the effect of dexamethasone on IL-10 secretion ( P < 0.001 ) .
Pretreatment with TNFa dimin-ished , and with IL-10 improved , the ability of dexamethasone to suppress IL-6 secretion in whole-blood cell cultures ( P < 0.01 for both ) and to enhance IL-1 receptor antagonist secretion by U937 cells ( P < 0.05 for both ) .
TNFa decreased ( P < 0.001 ) , while IL-10 increased ( P < 0.001 ) , the concentration of dexamethasone binding sites in these cells , with no discernible effect on their binding affinity .
We conclude that glucocorticoids differentially modulate TNFa and IL-10 secretion by human monocytes in a LPS dose-dependent fashion and that the sensitivity of these cells to glucocorticoids is altered by TNFa or IL-10 pretreatment ; TNFa blocks their effects , whereas IL-10 acts syner-gistically with glucocorticoids .
This is accompanied by opposite glucocorticoid receptor changes , respectively opposing and favoring glucocorticoid actions .
This study suggests that the pattern of pro-/ antiinflammatory cytokine secretion may alter the response of patients to glucocorticoid therapy .
( J Clin Endocrinol Metab 84 : 2834-2839 , 1999 ) GLUCOCORTICOIDS are widely employed in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases ( 1 ) .
Varying sensitivity to glucocorticoid therapy has emerged from the different clinical responses to glucocorticoids among the multitude of patients with autoimmune/ inflammatory diseases , on the basis of which they are classified as corticosteroid-sensitive or corticosteroid-resistant .
The response of the disease to glucocorticoid therapy depends not only on the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) concentration and binding affinity but also on postreceptor mechanisms and interactions of the GR with DNA hormone-responsive elements and other nuclear factors , such as AP-1 and NF- « B ( 2 , 3 ) .

diseases may be induced by the inflammatory process and/or be genetically or constitutionally determined ( 4 , 5 ) .
Cytokines , the main endocrine , paracrine , and autocrine factors of the immune/inflammatory response , have been reported to modulate the sensitivity of immune cells to glucocorticoids ( 6-10 ) .
Tumor necrosis factor « ( TNFa , a proinflammatory cytokine ) and interleukin ( IL ) -10 ( a T helper 2-type and antiinflammatory cytokine ) are secreted by activated macrophages and play opposite roles in both innate and specific immune responses ( 11-15 ) .
Monocytes/macrophages , as antigen-presenting cells , are of major importance in the decision for differentiation of naive Th0 CD4+ cells toward Th1- directed cellular immunity or Th2-directed humoral immunity .
Glucocorticoids promote a shift from Th1-type and proinflammatory to Th2-type and antiinflammatory cytokine secretory pattern .
This is because the former is strongly inhibited by glucocorticoids , whereas the latter is not or positively affected ( 16-19 ) .
In this study , we hypothesized that cytokines could differentially regulate the sensitivity of normal human 2834 GLUCOCORTICOID , TNFa , AND IL-10 monocytes /macrophages from healthy subjects to glucocorticoids in a fashion that could be influenced by the balance of proinflammatory /antiinflammatory cytokine secretion .
To test this hypothesis , we first analyzed the pattern of dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of TNFa and IL-10 secretion by LPS-stimulated whole-blood cell cultures ; and , second , we studied the modulation of the dexamethasone responses of human LPS-stimulated whole-blood cell cultures or of a phorbol-ester-stimulated human monocytic cell line by preincubation with TNFa or IL-10 .
Materials and Methods Whole-blood cell cultures Ten healthy male volunteers ( age range , 25-45 yr old ) served as blood donors .
The blood was treated as previously described ( 20 ) .
The whole-blood cell cultures were treated as follows : 1 ) LPS ( endotoxin from Salmonella enteritidis , Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) was added at a final concentration of either 100 pg/mL , 1 ng/mL , or 10 ng/mL..
In whole-blood cell cultures , the mononuclear cells activated by LPS are mainly monocytes Dexamethasone was added at a final concentration ranging from 10 °-10~® mol/L in separate wells containing LPS .
Plates were incubated at 37 C in 5 % CO , .
The incubation periods for LPS-stimulated whole blood were 24 h and 48 h. 2 ) LPS was added at a final concentration of 1 ng/mL .
Twenty-four hours and 48 h before LPS stimulation , the whole-blood cell culture was incubated alone or either in the presence of TNFa ( 1 ng/mL ) or IL-10 ( 50 pg/mL ) .
Dexamethasone was added at a final concentration of 10 ® mol/L in separate wells containing LPS .
Plates were incubated at 37 C in 5 % CO , .
The incubation period for LPS-stimulated whole blood was 24 h. The contents of the wells were then collected and centrifuged at 900 % g for 10 min .
Supernatants were then recovered and stored at -20 C before analysis .
Cell line cultures Two types of clones ( plus and minus ) of the myeloid monocytic cell line , U937 cells , were a generous gift from Priscilla Biswas and Guido Poli ( Ospedale San Raffaele , Immunopathogenesis Unit , Milano , Italy ) .
Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 ( BioWhittaker , Inc. Belgium ) with 10 % steroid-free heat-inactivated FCS , 100 U/mL penicillin , 100 ug/ml streptomycin sulfate , and 2 mmol /L glutamine ( BioWhittaker , Inc. ) at 37 C in 5 % CO , .
The FCS was treated with 1 % dextran-coated charcoal to remove endogenous sex steroids and glucocorticoids .
Cells were counted and cultured in medium alone or in the presence of TNFa ( 10 ng/mL ) or IL-10 ( 250 pg/mL ) ( R & D Systems , UK ) for 24 h and 48 h. The cells were then treated as follows : 1 ) The cells were removed , counted , and prepared for whole-cell dexamethasone binding assay ; 2 ) The cells were stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate ( PMA ) , at a final concentration of 10 ng/mL , for 24 h , in medium alone or in the presence of dexamethasone ( 107B and 10 ® mol/L ) .
The supernatants were then recovered and stored at -20 C before further analyses .
Whole-cell dexamethasone binding assay A whole-cell dexamethasone binding assay was used to quantify GR number and to determine GR affinity in untreated and TNFa- or IL-10-treated cells .
Cells were incubated , in a waterbath at 37 C , for 2 h , at a final concentration of 10 `` cells/mL in RPMI 1640 buffer solution containing 0.5 % BSA ( Sigma , Belgium ) supplemented with seven different concentrations of [ °H ] -dexamethasone ( Amersham International , Arlington Heights , IL ) ranging from 2.5-50 nmol/L ( SA , 82 Ci/mmol ) , in the presence or in the absence of 1000-fold excess of unlabeled dexamethasone ( Sigma ) .
After incubation , cells were cooled , centrifuged , and washed before the supernatant was carefully aspired .
Cells were resus-pended in an equal volume of scintillation cocktail for counting .
Dissociation constant ( K , , ) values and receptor binding capacity were determined on the basis of saturation curves using nonlinear regression computed with the Prism 2.0 program ( GraphPad Software , Inc. ) .
Sta- 2835 tistical analyses were performed on the Scatchard analysis of the same curves .
Immunoassays Specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure human TNFa , IL-10 , and IL-6 ( Biosource Technologies , Inc. /Medgenix , Belgium ) and IL-1 Ra ( receptor antagonist ) ( R & D Systems ) and were performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Absorbency was transformed to cytokine concentration using a standard curve computed with Medgenix enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay software .
Statistical analyses The relative changes of cytokine production were computed for each dexamethasone dose .
A logarithmic transformation was used for the percentage of response , to normalize the distribution .
A generalized linear mixed model ( SAS PROC MIXED ) was used to analyze the dexamethasone general effect and the specific-dose effect on cytokine secretion .
All results were considered to be significant at the 5 % critical level ( P < 0.05 ) .
Statistical analyses were carried out using the SAS software package ( SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , NC ) .
Nonparametric ( Mann Withney and Wilcoxon tests ) and parametric tests ( Student 's t and ANOVA tests ) were also used for comparisons , as appropriate .
Results Dexamethasone modulates TNFa and IL-10 secretion in LPS-stimulated whole-blood cell cultures ( Fig .
1 ) TNFa and IL-10 secretion were significantly increased in LPS-stimulated whole-blood cell cultures ( P < 0.001 ) .
Although both absolute and percent baseline values are shown , only the statistical comparisons between cytokine levels expressed as mean percent baseline are reported ( Fig .
1 , right panels ) .
TNFa secretion was uniformly suppressed in a dose-dependent fashion by dexamethasone ( 10 °-10~° mol/L ) after three different concentrations of LPS ( Fig .
1 , middle and right panels ) .
Nevertheless , the dexamethasone-induced inhibition of TNFa at 107° and 107 `` mol/L was less marked after 1 and 10 ng than after 0.1 ng LPS stimulation ( P < 0.001 ) ( Fig .
1 , right panels ) .
In contrast , the effect of dexamethasone on IL-10 secretion was biphasic , characterized by stimulation at the lower doses employed and inhibition at the higher doses ( Fig .
1 , left and right panels ) .
LPS dose effects on dexamethasone-induced changes in IL-10 secretion were ob-served , ; IL-10 was strongly suppressed by dexamethasone ( 10~°-10~° mol/L ) after 0.1 ng LPS stimulation , whereas its secretion was biphasic after 1 and 10 ng of LPS stimulation ( P < 0.001 ) .
After exposure to 1 and 10 ng LPS , there was no difference in IL-10 modulation by dexamethasone at 10~° and 10~° mol/L ; however , a significant difference appeared at 10~ `` and 10~° mol/L glucocorticoid ( P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 , respectively ) ( Fig .
1 , right panels ) .
At each of the three concentrations of LPS employed , the dexamethasone-induced modulation ( 10 °-10~° mol/L ) was significantly different between IL-10 and TNFa ( P < 0.05-0.001 ) .
After 0.1 ng LPS , however , no difference was observed in the dexamethasone-induced modulation of IL-10 and TNFa secretion at 10~ `` and 10~° mol/L glucocorticoid ( Fig .
1 , right panels ) .
The results were similar at both 24- and 48-h incubations ( Fig .
1 , right panels ) .
TNFa and IL-10 modulate dexamethasone-mediated IL-6 suppression in whole-blood cell cultures ( Fig .

Dexamethasone effects on the LPS-stimulated secretion of TNFa or IL-10 in whole-blood cell cultures from male normal volunteers .
Data are expressed as mean + SEM .
Modulation is presented as mean absolute cytokine levels and middle panels ) and as mean percent baseline ( right panels ) after an incubation of 24 h ( A ) or 48 h ( B ) .
The statistical comparisons of cytokine levels are shown only for the mean percent baseline data ( right panels ) .
Dexamethasone suppressed TNFa in a dose-dependent fashion .
By contrast , its effect on IL-10 secretion was biphasic , producing a stimulation at the lower doses employed and an inhibition at the higher doses .
At each of the three concentrations of LPS stimulation employed , the dexamethasone-induced modulation at 10 *-10 ® mol/L was significantly different between TNFa and IL-10 ( * , P < 0.05 ; ** , P < 0.001 ) .
A LPS dose-dependent modulation of the IL-10 secretion by dexamethasone from 10 *-10~® mol/L was observed : IL-10 was strongly suppressed after 0.1 ng LPS stimulation by the higher doses of dexamethasone ( 10 *-10~® mol/L ) , whereas the IL-10 secretion was biphasic after 1 ng and 10 ng LPS stimulation ( 00 , P < 0.001 ) .

The whole-blood cell cultures exposed to TNFa or IL-10 did not produce IL-6 .

Preincubation with TNFa was associated with a lower IL-6 secretion than preincubation with IL-10 ( P < 0.01 ) .
A longer pretreatment , up to 48 h before LPS stimulation , was associated with poor IL-6 secretion and did not enable us to assess corticosensitivity .
The dexamethasone-mediated IL-6 inhibition was stronger after preincubation with IL-10 ( 18.9 + 1.5 % , P < 0.01 ) and weaker after preincubation with TNFa ( 58.5 + 2.1 % , P < 0.01 ) than with medium alone ( 41.1 + 1.83 % ) .
TNFa and IL-10 modulate dexamethasone-induced IL-1 Ra secretion by a human monocytic cell line ( Fig .
3 ) We examined whether TNFa and IL-10 preincubation could change the sensitivity to dexamethasone assessed by dexamethasone-induced IL-1 Ra secretion in the human monocytic cell line U937 .
In the baseline condition , IL-1 Ra secretion was increased after both TNFa ( 16.4 + 0.9 pg/mL , P < 0.01 ) and IL-10 ( 10.1 + 0.6 pg/mL , P < 0.01 ) preincu-bation ; no significant difference in the IL-1 Ra level was observed after these two preincubations .
After PMA stimulation , however , dexamethasone-induced IL-1 Ra secretion at 10~° mol/L was higher with IL-10 preincubation ( 55.7 + 3.5 2837 70 -*- Control -i- IL-10 ( 250 pg/ml ) 3 so- | -¥- TNFa ( 10 ng/ml ) 50 p o 1 IL-1ra ( pg/ml ) 8 20 0 T i T T T T T 0 -8 -6 Dexamethasone log [ M ] Fig .

No significant difference was observed between the IL-1 Ra responses of plus and minus clones of U937 cells .
TNFa decreases , and IL-10 increases , the GR concentration ( but not binding affinity ) in a human monocytic cell line ( Fig .
4 ) To assess the effect of TNFa and IL-10 on the GR number and binding affinity , we used dexamethasone radioligand binding in the human monocytic cell line U937 .
This was done to avoid the high variability observed in studies of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
U937 cells were cultured , in the absence or presence of TNFa or IL-10 , for up to 48 h ; and dexamethasone binding was assessed .
No change in proliferation rate was observed between the different preincubations ( data not shown ) .
Both TNFa and IL-10 failed to induce a significant modulation of the GR number at time periods less than 48 h. However , 48-h exposure to TNFa resulted in a 60 % decrease of the GR number ( 4,834 + 246 sites/cell vs. 11,709 + 544 sites P < 0.001 ) without any change of the binding affinity ( 11.4 + 1.5 nmol/L vs. 16.1 + 1.8 nmol/L ) , whereas exposure to IL-10 resulted in a 50 % increase of the GR numbers ( 17,734 + 87 sites vs. 11,709 + 544 sites P < 0.001 ) , also without any change 2838 20 FRANCHIMONT ET AL .

Discussion Although glucocorticoids clearly suppress proinflammatory cytokines , they have been reported not to change ( 16 , 19 ) , to increase ( 17 ) , or to decrease IL-10 secretion ( 18 , 21 ) .
An in vivo increase of plasma IL-10 by exogenous glucocorticoids was previously reported both in human and murine endo-toxemia ( 22 , 23 ) .
Here , we observed a biphasic effect of glucocorticoids on IL-10 secretion by LPS-stimulated whole-blood cell cultures .
Depending on the amplitude of LPS stimulation , glucocorticoids at low doses increased , and at high doses decreased , IL-10 secretion ; in contrast , TNFa secretion was always suppressed by dexamethasone in a classic sigmoidal fashion .
Thus , the degree of monocyte/macro-phage activation modulates the effect of dexamethasone on IL-10 secretion , whereas the direction of the TNFa response to glucocorticoids remains unchanged .
cAMP-elevating drugs increase IL-10 and decrease TNFa secretion ( 24 ) , and cAMP-responsive elements have been described in both the IL-10 and TNFa promoters ( 25 , 26 ) .
The GR interacts with cAMP-responsive element-binding protein , and this interaction may play a role in the differential modulation of IL-10 and TNFa secretion by glucocorticoids ( 27 ) .
IL-1Ra is a receptor-level natural antagonist of IL-1 that was isolated from monocytes and monocytic cell lines ( 28 ) .
Free [ PH ] -dexamethasone ( nM ) Glucocorticoids inhibit IL-1 Ra secretion by LPS-stimulated human peripheral monocytes ( 29 ) but potentiate the IL-1B secretory response of monocytic cells to PMA ( 30 ) .
The PMA-differentiated monocytic cell line U937 produces IL-1Ra ( 31 ) .
Here , we demonstrated that dexamethasone increased IL-1 Ra secretion by these cells , providing an additional explanation for an indirect antiinflammatory action for glucocorticoids .
Preincubation with TNFa or IL-10 modulated the sensitivity to dexamethasone in both normal leukocytes present in whole-blood cell cultures and U937 cells .
Both TNFa and IL-10 inhibited IL-6 and enhanced IL-1 Ra secretion in the absence of dexamethasone ; however , their effects were in opposite directions in the presence of dexamethasone .
Thus , whereas IL-6 was more inhibited by TNFa than by IL-10 at the baseline state , dexamethasone-mediated IL-6 inhibition was less prominent after TNFa incubation than after IL-10 incubation .
Similarly , whereas IL-1 Ra secretion was slightly more stimulated by TNFa than by IL-10 at the baseline state , in the presence of dexamethasone , it was blocked by TNFa and dramatically enhanced by IL-10 preincubation .
IL-10 increased , and TNFa decreased , the GR concentration of U937 cells without modifying its binding affinity for dexamethasone .
Previously , some cytokines ( such as IFNy ) were shown to increase sensitivity of cells to glucocorticoids by increasing the receptor concentration ( 6 ) , whereas other cytokines ( such as IL-2 , IL-4 , and IL-13 ) decreased sensitivity by decreasing its binding affinity ( 7 , 8 ) .
MIF , the macrophage migration inhibitory factor , is regulated by glucocorticoids like IL-10 ; however , unlike IL-10 , it blocks dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of cytokine production by LPS-stimulated monocytes ( 10 ) .
Our study suggests that IL-10 may enhance glucocorticoid action by increasing the GR concen-tration , whereas TNFa may exert the opposite effect by decreasing the GR concentration .
Changes in the receptor may be one of several mechanisms for altering tissue sensitivity GLUCOCORTICOID , TNFa , AND IL-10 to glucocorticoids ( 3 ) .
Indeed , the modulation of dexamethasone response by cytokines may also be related to NF- « B , which is involved in the transcription of many proinflammatory cytokines , including IL-6 , and is highly expressed in inflamed tissues ( 5 ) .
Glucocorticoids and IL-10 inhibit NFE- « B activation , whereas TNFa activates NF- « B ( 32-34 ) .
The opposite effect on NF- « B modulation exerted by TNFa and IL-10 may also provide an additional explanation for the opposite effects of these cytokines on glucocorticoid sensitivity described here .
In Crohn 's disease , blocking TNFa with humanized antibody ( cA2 ) or administering IL-10 were found to be useful adjunctive therapies ( 35 , 36 ) .
Because TNFa decreases , and IL-10 increases , sensitivity to dexamethasone , this study provides evidence for another potential beneficial indirect effect of these cytokine therapies .
This also suggests that the balance of TNFa/IL-10 secretion during the course of an inflammatory disease may determine changes in sensitivity to glucocorticoids .
Thus , a patient with a high or low TNFa/ IL-10 ratio would , respectively , be less or more sensitive to endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids and more or less susceptible to develop corticosteroid-resistant and -sensitive inflammatory disease .
