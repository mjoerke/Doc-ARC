Positive and Negative Regulation of Granulocyte- Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Promoter Activity by AML1-Related Transcription Factor , PEBP2 By Atsushi Takahashi , Masanobu Satake , Yuko Yamaguchi-lwai , Suk-Chul Bae , Jie Lu , Mitsuo Maruyama , Yu Wen Zhang , Hiroya Oka , Naoko Arai , Ken-ichi Arai , and Yoshiaki Ito The - granulocyte-macrophage - colony-stimulating - factor ( GM-CSF ) gene promoter contains a consensus sequence for the polyomavirus enhancer binding-protein 2 ( PEBP2 ) transcription factor , which consists of a and B subunits .
There are at least two genes , aA and « B , encoding the a subunit .
aB is the mouse homologue of human AML 1 gene detected at the breakpoints of t ( 8 ; 21 ) and t ( 3 ; 21 ) myeloid leukemias .
We examined « A1 ( an aA-gene product ) and aB1 and « B2 { two aB-encoded isomers ) for their effects on the GM-CSF promoter .
PEBP2 « eA1 , « B1 , and « B2 proteins bound the PEBP2 site within the mouse GM-CSF promoter .
PEBP2aeA1 and aB1 enhanced the expression of the GM-CSF promoter-driven reporter plasmid in unstimulated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 - acetate / phytohemagglutinin - stimulated RANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) !
is a multifunctional cytokine with diverse biologic activities such as the control of hematopoie-sis `` and the enhancement of functions and survival of mature leukocytes involved in the host defense against microor-ganisms .
* Its overproduction or inappropriate expression has been implicated in the establishment of inflammatory dis-eases `` and in the autocrine growth of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cells . ``
Therefore , elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate its production may provide insights into the patho-physiology of immune-mediated injury and leukemogenesis . ``
The regulation of GM-CSF expression involves both tran-and posttranscriptional `` `` `` ° control mecha-nisms .
The promoter region of the GM-CSF gene has been shown to respond to agents mimicking the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) signaling , such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-ace-tate ( TPA ) plus phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) or TPA plus A23187 . ``
'' The promoter contains several elements highly conserved between murine and human genes , referred to as CLE1 ( CK-1 ) , CLE2 ( CK-2 ) , `` `` ° GM- « B , `` `` `` `` GC box , `` `` CATT ( A/T ) repeat , `` and CLEO .
'* `` `` Deletion analysis has indicated that the region from nucleotide -95 to +27 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter is capable of mediating induction in response to TPA/A23187 in human Jurkat T-cell line . ``
GM- « B/GC-box ( -95 to -73 ) and CLEO ( -54 to -40 ) within the region are required for the inducibility .
'~ ' > 44'523 In addition to the highly conserved elements mentioned above , we recognized that the sequence located at -64 to -58 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter is also totally conserved between the mouse and the human genes ( Fig 1A ) .
The sequence agrees with the consensus sequence , Pu/TAC-CPuCA , * `` for the binding of the polyomavirus enhancer binding-protein 2 ( PEBP2 ) .
`` * `` ° PEBP2 , also called CBF , is a transcription factor recognizing the PEA site `` `` within the polyomavirus ( Py ) enhancer A core and playing an important role in transcription and replication of Py DNA .
** `` ° The A core contains the binding sites of the API and Ets family proteins , in addition to the PEBP2 site .
Interestingly , the sequence arrangement around the PEBP2 consensus Blood , Vol 86 , No 2 ( July 15 ) , 1995 : pp 607-616 human Jurkat T cells .
In contrast , the promoter activity was suppressed by « B2 .
Coexpression of « B1 and « B2 showed that the promoter activity could be determined by the aB1/ aB2 ratio .
Jurkat cell extract contained PEBP2 site-binding protein ( s ) that cross-reacted with antimouse « A1 antibod-ies .
Northern blot analysis indicated the expression of human PEBP2aeA , « B ( AMLT } , and B genes in Jurkat cells .
Although further studies are required to determine the precise role of PEBP2 in the GM-CSF promoter activity , the present findings suggested the importance of the relative ratio of different PEBP2 isoforms in regulating the levels of the promoter activity .

within the GM-CSF promoter is quite similar to that within the A core of the Py enhancer ( Fig 1A ) .
This finding prompted us to examine the function of PEBP2 as a potential regulator of the GM-CSF promoter activity .
Purified PEBP2 consists of a and 3 subunits . ``
'' `` `` ' We have identified two independent genes encoding the a proteins , PEBP2aA® `` and PEBP2aB , `` `` and a single gene encoding the # protein . ``
The a proteins contain the DNA-binding domain highly homologous to the Drosophila runt protein . ``
The 3 protein can not bind to DNA by itself ; how-ever , its association with the a protein results in a formation of a heterodimeric complex with an increased DNA-binding affinity .
`` `` `` * > `` We recently cloned two alternatively-spliced aB cDNA species encoding two distinct isoforms of the « B proteins , « B1 and « B2 ( Fig 2 ) .
`` ° The « B2 protein is identical to the « B1 protein except that « B2 has an internal deletion of 64 amino acids ( AaB2 ) .
These two isoforms appear to have distinct functions . ``
Recent reports suggest remarkable roles of PEBP2 in leu-kemogenesis .

`` * `` * Also , the human homologue of PEBP23 has been identified at the breakpoint of inversion 16 translocation associated with a subset of AML . ``
PEBP2 has been implicated in the T-cell-specific gene regulation .
`` ** `` Northern blot analysis of the RNAs obtained from mouse tissues and in situ hybridization analysis of the mouse tissue sections showed that PEBP2eA and aB mRNAs are expressed in immature and mature thymocytes , `` suggesting the involvement of PEBP2 in transcriptional regulation throughout the T-cell development .
The potential role of PEBP2 in T-cell ontogeny has been suggested by the activation of the TCR/ # 3 enhancer by exogenously expressed aAl , `` ' « B1 , or « B2 .
PEBP2 may also play a role in the functions of mature T cells , such as the production of GM-CSF .
In the present study , we examined the effects of exogenously expressed mouse AMLI/PEBP2a cDNAs on the GM-CSF promoter activity .
We found that PEBP2 proteins bind the PEBP ?
site within the mouse GM-CSF promoter and that multiple PEBP2 isoforms generated by alternative splicing positively or negatively regulate the GM-CSF promoter activity .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids .
- Wild-type ( wt ; pSVGM-95CAT ) and mutant ( pSVGM-61.62CAT ) reporter plasmids had been constructed by inserting the -95-to-+24 segment of mouse GM-CSF promoter into the pSVOCAT plasmid . ``
pEFBos-aA1 , -a « B1 , and -a « B2 `` are expression plasmids for PEBP2aA1 , « B1 , and « B2 cDNAs driven by the human elongation factor 1a promoter . ``
DNA-binding assay .
In vitro transcription and translation of PEBP2aB1 and « B2 were performed as described previously . ``
P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells were maintained and transfected with pEFBos-aA 1 , - « B1 , and -aB2 plasmids as described . ``
In brief , P19 cells , plated at 1 x 10° cells per 6-cm dish 24 hours earlier , were transfected with 10 ug of plasmid DNAs using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure `` `` and were harvested 48 hours posttransfection .
Jurkat human T cells ( clone JP1M1* ; 1 x 10 `` ) were incubated with or without TPA ( 10 ng/mL ; Sigma , St Louis , MO ) and PHA M-form ( PHA-M ; 0.5 % ; GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) for 12 to 48 hours in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( 10 % FCS-RPMI ) .
Whole cell extracts ( WCEs ) of P19 and Jurkat cells were prepared as described . ``
The synthetic oligonucleotide containing a wt PEBP2 consensus sequence was either radiolabeled with [ a- `` `` P ] deoxycytidine triphosphate using Klenow DNA polymerase ( Toyobo , Osaka , Japan ) or end-labeled with [ y-PJadenosine triphosphate using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Toyobo ) and was used as a probe .
DNA-binding reactions and electro-phoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) were performed as described `` with some modifications .
WCEs ( 10 to 20 g ) or in vitro translated « BI or « B2 proteins ( approximately 1 fmol ) mixed with Escherichia coli-produced /32 protein `` ( approximately 10 fmol ) were incubated with a radiolabeled DNA probe ( 10° cpm ) in a 10-uL reaction mix containing 20 mmol/L HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 20 % glycerol , 0.1 mol/L KCI , 0.2 mmol/L EDTA , 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 0.5 mmol/L dithiothreitol , 100 Lg/mL bovine serum albumin , 0.01 % Noni-det P40 ( Boehringer Mannheim , Germany ) , and 1 Lg poly ( dI-dC ) ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
After 30 minutes at room temperature , the reaction mixture was analyzed on a 5 % or 6 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 % TBE ( 22 mmol/L Tris , 22 mmol/L boric acid , and 0.6 mmol/L EDTA ) .
After electrophoresis at 350 V ( 10 to 30 mA ) for 1 hour at 4°C , the gel was dried and analyzed by image analyzer ( Fuji Photo Film Co , Ltd , Tokyo , Japan ) .

REGULATION OF GM-CSF PROMOTER BY PEBP2 Transfection and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assay .
A CAT reporter plasmid ( 4 ug ) and an effector plasmid ( 0 to 5 ug ) were cotransfected into Jurkat cells `` `` ( 2 to 5 x 10 ® cells ) using a modified diethyl aminoethyl-dextran method . ``
After 24 hours , cells were incubated in the absence or presence of TPA ( 10 ng/mL ) and PHA-M ( 0.5 % ) `` ° in 10 % FCS-RPMI for an additional 24 hours .
The CAT activity in the cell extract was examined at 48 hours post-transfection as described `` and was corrected for the protein concentration of the extract as determined by the Bradford method ( Bio-Rad protein assay kit ; Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) .
Total amount of plasmid DNAs transfected was adjusted to 10 ug by addition of the pEF-Bos backbone vector `` for expression plasmids .
The pRSV-BGal plasmid `` ( 1 ug ) was also included in all the samples to monitor the efficiency of transfection .

After exposure to x-ray films , all the membranes were washed to strip off radioactivities and were reprobed with human 3-actin cDNA to assess the integrity and quantity of the loaded RNA .
RESULTS Binding of PEBP2 to the GM-CSF promoter .
We first examined by EMSA whether the mouse PEBP2 proteins bind the PEBP2 consensus sequence within the mouse GM-CSF promoter .
Synthetic oligonucleotides encompassing nucleotides -71 to -51 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter and their mutants ( shown in Fig 1B ) were used as labeled probes or competitors .
PEBP2 « B1 and « B2 ( Fig 2 ) were translated in vitro and mixed with 32 protein , the most abundant isoform encoded by the /3 gene , which had been expressed in E coli and purified . ``

610 plex formation was abolished by the wt competitor ( Fig 3 , lane 4 ) , whereas it was not affected by the 61.62 or 59.60 mutants ( Fig 3 , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
The B2 protein formed a faster-migrating complex ( Fig 3 , lane 7 ) .
In this case , the mutant competitors , 61.62 and 59.60 , weakly competed with the band formation ( see Fig 3 and compare lanes 9 and 10 with lane 7 ) .
This is most likely because of the fact that « B2 binds to DNA 2 to 3 times more strongly than aBI1* `` and that each of these two mutations did not completely abolish the binding site .
PEBP2aA !
( Fig 2 ) cDNA was transfected into P19 cells that express neither aA nor aB , and their WCE was prepared .
« A1 protein also generated a complex having similar PEBP2 site-binding property ( Fig 3 , lanes 11 to 14 ) .
It migrated more slowly than the complex formed by the « BI and 32 proteins .
A faster-migrating doublet ( Fig 3 , lane 11 ) , which migrated at about the same position as « B2 and was also observed with WCE from P19 cells not transfected with PEBP2a ( Fig 3 , lane 15 ) , did not show PEBP2-site specificity ( see Fig 3 and compare lanes 12 , 13 , and 14 with lane 11 ) .
Because the doublet was also detected in Jurkat cells ( Fig 3 , lane 1 ) and the intensity of the doublet was reduced after the TPA/PHA stimulation ( Fig 3 , lane 2 ) , we rigorously examined whether they are related to PEBP2 .
By performing EMSA using the oligonucleotides as probes or competitors containing the consensus PEBP2 site as well as mutated versions , including the one harboring the completely mutated PEBP2 site ( GTGCCAG compared with the original TGTGGTC ) , and by testing the reactivity of the anti-eAl antiserum , `` `` we came to the conclusion that they are unrelated to PEBP2 and , thus , represent nonspecific DNA-binding proteins ( data not shown ) .
These results indicated that the PEBP2 « B1 , « B2 , and « A1 proteins bind the PEBP2 site within the mouse GM-CSF promoter at least in vitro , most likely as a heterodimer with the /3 protein .
Effect of PEBP2 on the GM-CSF promoter activity .
pSVGM-95CAT reporter plasmid encodes the CAT gene driven by nucleotides -95 to +24 of the mouse GM-CSF promoter region containing CLEZ/CK-2 , `` ~* `` ° GM- « kB , `` 52 `` ' GC box , `` `` PEBP2 consensus , CATT ( A/T ) repeat , `` and CLEO'* `` elements .
The pSVGM-95CAT was cotransfected into Jurkat T cells with expression plasmids for PEBP2aA1 , « B1 , or « B2 .
The transfected cells were stimulated with TPA/PHA or left unstimulated .
As shown in Fig 4A , expression of « A1 or « B1 stimulated the promoter activity of the reporter plasmid in a dose-dependent manner .
In contrast , « B2 inhibited the promoter activity by about 50 % in both unstimulated and stimulated cells .
The promoter activity of the effector plasmids was not affected by TPA/PHA treatment as assessed by the expression of pEFBos-CAT in unstimulated and stimulated cells ( data not shown ) .
To confirm that the effects of PEBP2 on the promoter activity were mediated by its binding to the PEBP2 site , the 61.62 mutation in Fig 1B was introduced into the CAT plasmid .
The « A1 and « B1 failed to activate the promoter activity of the mutant pSVGM61.62CAT plasmid ( Fig 4B ) .
The transcriptional repression by the « B2 was also abolished by the mutation ( Fig 4B ) .
These results suggested that PEBP2 regulates the GM-CSF promoter activity , positively or negatively depending on its isoforms , by binding to its cognate binding site in vivo .

Effects of PEBP2 « proteins on the GM-CSF promoter activity .
( A ) Jurkat T cells were transfected with an indicated amount of expression plasmids encoding PEBP2 « A1 , aB1 , or « B2 proteins together with 4 ug of the GM-CSF promoter-CAT plasmid ( pSVGM-95CAT ) } .
After 24 hours , the cells were stimulated with TPA and PHA or left unstimulated for additional 24 hours .
CAT activity was normalized to that in unstimulated Jurkat cells not transfected with PEB-P2 « s .
Each point represents an average of four independent transfec-tions .
( B ) Effect of mutations in PEBP2 site within GM-CSF promoter .
Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with 5 pg of each expression ( « A1 , « B1 , « B2 ) or backbone ( - ) vector and 4 ug of wt ( pSVGM-95CAT ) or mutant ( 61.62 ; pSVGM61.62CAT ) reporter CAT plasmid .
Averages of at least two independent experiments are shown .
The opposite effects of « BI and « B2 prompted us to examine the possibility that they can antagonize with each other in the regulation of the promoter activity .
« BI and aB2 were cotransfected at various ratios into Jurkat cells .
As the « B1/ « B2 ratio increased , there was a gradual increase in the CAT activity in both TPA/PHA-stimulated ( Fig 5 ) and unstimulated Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
This result suggested that there is a regulatory mechanism that involves the competition among PEBP2 « proteins with distinct transactivation or repression potentials on the promoter activity .
Expression of PEBP2 site-binding proteins in Jurkat T cells .
When WCE of unstimulated Jurkat cells was incubated with the labeled GM-CSF promoter oligonucleotides ( Fig 1B , wt ) , two major protein-DNA complexes were ob-served , the faster-migrating one being a doublet as described From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

The yB1 value for percentage of chloram-henicol acetylation is shown s lke cB2 above each lane .
above ( Fig 6 , lane 1 ) .
The formation of the slower-migrating complex indicated by an arrow was abolished by the addition of unlabeled wt oligonucleotides in the reaction ( Fig 6 , lane 2 ) .
In contrast , competitors containing mutated PEBP2 sites , 61.62 and 59.60 , did not affect the complex formation ( Fig 6 , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
The mutation 57.58 , located at the margin of the PEBP2 site , partially inhibited the complex formation ( Fig 6 , lane 5 ) .
Thus , the complex indicated by the arrow showed the property of a PEBP2 site-specific protein-DNA complex .
The faster-migrating doublet was considered nonspecific ( see above ) .
When the Jurkat cells were stimulated with TPA/PHA for 24 or 48 hours , the specific band was also detected , but its intensity was slightly diminished ( Fig 6 , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
Comparison of the gel-shift mobility showed that the Jurkat complex comigrated with the protein-DNA complex formed by the mixture of the mouse aBI1 and B2 proteins ( Fig 3 , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
The results indicated the presence of endogenous protein ( s ) that bind to the PEBP2 site within the GM-CSF promoter in unstimulated and TPA/ PHA-stimulated Jurkat cells .
To assess whether PEBP2a proteins , when exogenously expressed in Jurkat cells , could compete with the endogenous PEBP2 site-binding protein ( s ) for DNA binding , WCE of PEBP2aA1l-overexpressed P19 cells was mixed with Jurkat WCE in EMSA .
As the amount of the « Al-containing extract was increased , the Jurkat complex gradually decreased in amount , and the « A1 band increased in intensity ( Fig 7A , lanes 2 to 5 ) .
Addition of the « B2-containing extract also gave a similar result ( Fig 7B , lanes 2 to 5 ) .
The Jurkat complex was not diminished by addition of WCE from P19 cells transfected with pEF-Bos backbone vector ( data not shown ) .
These results established that there are endogenous PEBP2 site-binding protein ( s ) in Jurkat cells that have the DNA-binding properties similar to « Al and « B2 .
These results also suggested that « A1 , « B1 , and « B2 transfected into Jurkat cells exerted their transcriptional regulatory activity by competing with endogenous Jurkat PEBP2 site-binding protein ( s ) for DNA binding .
Finally , we tested the reactivity of the Jurkat complex to rabbit polyclonal antiserum against mouse « Al protein , which also cross-reacts with mouse B1 . ``

EMSA showed that PEBP2 site-binding protein ( s ) structurally related to mouse PEBP2 « @ proteins were present in Jurkat cells .
Therefore , we performed Northern blot analysis to examine the expression of human PEBP2 genes .
The human e « B/AMLI probe showed at least four major species of mRNA ( Fig 9 , lane 1 ) similar to those described for human peripheral blood cells .
`` ° After Jurkat cells were stimulated with TPA/PHA for 24 hours , the expression of human « B/ AMLLI was markedly downregulated .
In the case of aA mRNA , increased amounts of poly ( A ) * RNA had to be blotted to detect the signals , suggesting that its expression in Jurkat cells was much less than that of human « BI/AMLI .
The human « A probe showed a cluster of three major mRNA species of 7.1 , 6.7 , and 6.1 kb ( Fig 9 , lane 3 ) .
The human aA mRNA was also markedly decreased in TPA/PHA-stimulated Jurkat cells .
A single major species of the human PEB-P2GmRNA was detected in unstimulated Jurkat cells ( Fig 9 , lane 5 ) .
Again , TPA/PHA stimulation significantly reduced the level of the human PEBP23 expression .
These results suggested that the human homologue ( s ) of the aB and possibly « A proteins constitutes at least a part of the Jurkat complex shown by EMSA .
The biologic significance of the TPA/PHA-induced downregulation of aA , eB/AML1 , and 3 expression remains to be clarified .
DISCUSSION Sequence analysis of the GM-CSF promoter had shown a putative binding site for PEBP2 that is totally conserved between the mouse and the human genes .
We showed that PEBP2 indeed binds the GM-CSF promoter and that the exogenously expressed « A1 and « BI activate and « B2 in-hibits , through the PEBP2 site , the transcription from the transfected GM-CSF promoter .
Human T-cell line , Jurkat , expresses low levels of aA and much higher levels of aB mRNAs .

tected that is antigenically related to mouse aA1 and aBI proteins .
The present study indicated that PEBP2 @ B2 had a repressor-like activity when transfected into Jurkat cells .
This seems to be contradictory to our previous report that « B2 is a transactivator when assayed in P19 cells . ``
« BI is the full-size « B isoform with a maximum transactivation potential .
« B2 , on the other hand , is only 25 % to 45 % as active as « BI as a transcriptional activator .
Although « B2 functions as a transactivator when tested in the cells where there is no endogenous PEBP ?
activity , one can imagine that « B2 could inhibit transcription within the cells where the average endogenous PEBP2 activity is stronger than that of « B2 .
Several examples of negative regulation by a weaker transactivator have been reported . ``
Alternatively , the repressor-like function of « B2 may be specific for the GM-CSF promoter .
In the context of the TCR/ # 3 enhancer linked to herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene promoter , `` `` the potential negative reg- 613 ulatory function would be alleviated by interaction of « B2 with other factors bound to adjacent sites .
The overall promoter activity of the reporter plasmid was increased by fivefold by the TPA/PHA stimulation .
Transcription factors interacting with the elements located between -91 to -73 and -54 to -40 have been shown to be responsible for this process .
'*'* ' `` `` `` `` `` What could be the role of PEBP2 ?
It has recently been shown that PEBP2/CBF and another transcription factor , Ets-1 , cooperatively bind to DNA . ``
We have evidence that PEBP2 hardly stimulates transcription by itself but it functionally cooperates with Ets-1 in vivo .
Therefore , PEBP2 appears to stimulate transcription by stabilizing the binding of Ets-1 or other activator proteins to DNA ( E. Ogawa and Y. Ito , unpublished observa-tion ) .
Figure 4 shows that the basal level of GM-CSF promoter activity before the TPA/PHA stimulation is reduced by 50 % by exogenous expression of « B2 .
This effect is not observed when the reporter plasmid containing the 61.62 mutation is used .
Therefore , « B2 must have interfered with the GM-CSF promoter activity in a transdominant negative fashion , strongly suggesting that the endogenous PEBP2 is contributing to the GM-CSF promoter activity significantly .
Although the magnitude of the reduction was only 50 % , it was not surprizing because « B2 is 25 % to 45 % as active as the full-size protein , aB1 .
* When the cells were stimulated by TPA/PHA and the overall GM-CSF promoter activity increased by about fivefold , exogenously expressed « B2 also showed the PEBP2 site-dependent reduction of the activity .
Once again , the result shows the involvement of the endogenous PEBP2 in the promoter activity .
In both states of the cells ( ie , before and after the TPA/PHA stimulation ) , the 61.62 mutation did not affect the basal level of transcription .
We interpreted the result to mean that particular ratios of the « A1 , « B1 , and « B2 proteins , as well as perhaps as yet unknown PEBP2 site-binding protein ( s ) in Jurkat cells , in the two states are such that the positive and negative effects on the PEBP2 site are balanced at the levels observed .
Under these conditions , the mutation 61.62 would not affect the overall GM-CSF promoter activity .
To see the effect of mu-tation , we should change the relative ratio of the individual a proteins .
In effect , this is precisely what we are observing in Fig 4 .
By adding « B2 , we increased the negative force .
There , we observed the effect of the mutation .
Similarly , exogenous expression of « BI shifted the balance in such a way as to increase the positive force .
There , we saw the effect of the mutation .
In mouse T-cell lines , PEBP2aB !
and « B2 mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR ( Bae S-C , unpublished observations ) and the expression of PEBP2aB in normal murine thymocytes was revealed by in situ hybridiza-tion . ``
'' Nevertheless , further studies are required to draw any conclusion about the regulatory role of PEBP2 in the GM-CSF production by normal T cells .
An attractive hypothesis would be that the levels of the promoter activities of target genes are determined , at least in part , by distinct patterns of PEBP2a expression .
Characteristic modes of the expression of target genes may be maintained by cell- or tissue-specific ratios of the different PEBP2a isoforms .
There are other mRNA species of PEB-P2a « B that may encode different isoforms .

Cloning of all cDNAs of the PEBP2 family , characterization of proteins encoded by them , assessment of their effects on the activities of the promoter or enhancer of target genes , and analysis of their expression in various cells and tissues are clearly necessary .
Our present findings have suggested that the GM-CSF promoter is one of the targets of the PEBP2 .
A single bind-ing-site within the upstream element seems to be sufficient for its transcriptional regulatory activity .
By computer-aided sequence search , we further noted that PEBP2 consensus sequences also occur within the promoters of various genes , such as interleukin-3 , `` `` MIP1a/LD78 , `` `` myeloperoxidase , `` and the human eosinophil Charcot-Leyden crystal protein . ``
In fact , it has recently been reported that PEBP2/CBF sites in interleukin-3 and myeloperoxidase promoters are functionally important .
`` * ' The promoter activity could be regulated by positive or negative regulators generated from several distinct PEBP2a genes through differential posttranscriptional and , possibly , posttranslational modifications .
Accumulating evidence suggests that proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells are controlled by ordered regulation of gene expression by transcription factors and involve a controlled balance between positively and negatively acting factors .
A subversion of this controlled equilibrium `` may underlie the leukemogenesis by chromosomal translocations creating chi-meric proteins , `` * `` `` `` * `` * which may have unusual transcriptional regulatory properties .
Further study on the function of each PEBP2 « protein in the transcriptional control of each target gene would show the roles of the PEBP2 transcription factors in physiology and pathophysiology , such as embryonic devel-opment , `` T-cell differentiation , `` and leukemogenesis . ``
