6 Involvement of a Second Lymphoid-Specific Enhancer Element in the Regulation of Immunoglobulin Heavy-Chain Gene Expression TOWIA ARON LIBERMANN , MICHAEL LENARDO , t anp DAVID BALTIMORE* Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02142 , and Department of Biology , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 Received 13 December 1989/Accepted 8 March 1990 To determine whether enhancer elements in addition to the highly conserved octamer ( OCT motif are important for lymphoid-specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene , we have investigated the effect of mutating the binding site for a putative additional lymphoid-specific transcription factor , designated NF-pB , in the murine IgH enhancer .
We demonstrate that the NF-pB-binding site plays a critical role in the IgH enhancer , because mutation of the mB DNA motif decreased transcriptional activity of the IgH enhancer in cells of the B-cell lineage but not in nonlymphoid cells .
This effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a mutation in the OCTA site .
Moreover , combined mutation of both .B and OCTA sites further reduced enhancer activity in lymphoid cells .
Interestingly , alteration of either the pB or E3 site in a 70-base-pair fragment of the IgH enhancer that lacks the binding site for OCTA abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely .
Nevertheless , a multimer of the mB motif alone showed no enhancer activity .
DNase footprinting analysis corroborated the functional data showing that a lymphoid-specific protein binds to the mB DNA motif .
Our results suggest that the pB element is a new crucial element important for lymphoid-specific expression of the IgH gene but that interaction with another enhancer element is essential for its activity .
The 700-base-pair ( bp ) -long immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) enhancer shows a complex modular structure of a variety of overlapping positive-acting enhancer elements and negative-acting elements ( for a review , see reference 35 ) .
The majority of these elements appear to bind ubiquitous transcription factors that are present in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells ( 2 , 8 , 16 , 28 , 31 , 32 , 34 , 35 ) .
The E boxes El , E2 , E3 , and E4 represent one group of such enhancer elements ( 6 , 8 , 16 , 23 ) .
Mutational studies have suggested that the E-box elements contribute to the transcriptional regulation of the IgH gene but do not determine lymphoid specificity ( 13 , 16 , 27 , 42 ) .
An additional enhancer element , E , has been identified by binding of a protein designated w-EBP ( 42 ) .
Deletion analysis has provided evidence for functional importance of this element ( 42 ) .
Negative elements present in the enhancer appear to be active only in nonlymphoid cells and thus might contribute to lymphoid-specific expression of the IgH enhancer ( 30 , 44 ) .
Only one enhancer element thus far characterized , a highly conserved octamer ( OCT A ) -nucleotide motif , ATTT GCAT , has been shown to confer some lymphoid specificity to the IgH gene ( for a review , see reference 35 ) .
OCTA binds a variety of ubiquitous and cell-restricted factors ( 17 , 33 , 39 ) .
The Oct-1 transcription factor is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types ( 15 , 39 , 41 ) , whereas Oct-2 expression is restricted to B cells , some T cells , and some glial cells ( 14 , 15 , 38 , 39 ) .
The OCTA-nucleotide sequence is present in both the IgH promoter and enhancer ( 3 , 9 , 19 , 25 , 36 ) and has been found in a variety of other genes ( 4 , 5 , 18 , 20 , 26 , 37 ) .
Nevertheless , mutation of the OCTA sequence in the context of the whole IgH enhancer has only very little effect on its activity in lymphoid cells ( 16 , 27 ) , suggesting the presence * Corresponding author .

3155 of additional lymphoid-specific enhancer elements .
Indeed , a 460-bp fragment of the IgH enhancer that lacks the OCTA sequence retains substantial lymphoid-specific enhancer activity ( 16 ; this paper ) .
Araki et al .
( 1 ) have recently shown that introduction of nuclear extracts from myeloma cells into murine L cells containing the human IgH gene leads to specific expression of the IgH gene .
However , depletion of OCT A-nucleotide-binding factors from myeloma nuclear extracts did not diminish induction of IgH gene expression in L cells ( 1 ) .
They identified a new nuclear factor that showed characteristics of a second lymphoid-specific transcription factor .
This factor has been purified from a murine myeloma and binds to the sequence S-TATTTTAGGAAGCAAA-3 ' in the human IgH enhancer just downstream of the E3 motif ( 1 ) .
The murine IgH enhancer contains a similar but not identical sequence at the same location ( Fig .
1 ) .
The purified factor has been shown to induce expression in the human IgH gene in murine L cells and thus may play a critical role in IgH gene expression ( 1 ) .
To determine the functional role of this new factor , designated NF-pB in this study , we have introduced mutations into the homologous NF-uB- and OCTA-binding sites of the murine IgH enhancer .
We tested whether the murine IgH enhancer wB element is functionally comparable to the human IgH enhancer element and whether the B motif could be responsible for the lymphoid-specific expression of an OCT A-deleted IgH enhancer .
We have found that mutation of wB reduces activity of the murine IgH enhancer in pre-B , mature B , and plasma cells but not in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts .
We have narrowed down the lymphoid-specific element to a 70-bp fragment that contains B and E3 but not OCTA .
In contrast to other enhancer elements , no intrinsic enhancer activity was detected with the wB motif by itself , suggesting a necessity for interaction with another enhancer element .
Our results suggest that B together with OCTA 3156 LIBERMANN ET AL .

Site-directed mutagenesis .
Plasmids containing mutations in either OCTA or E3 were derived from plasmids described by Lenardo et al .
( 16 ) .
Specific site-directed mutagenesis of three nucleotides in the B DNA motif of the murine IgH enhancer between positions 414 and 427 was introduced by the gapped/heteroduplex method ( 40 ) , using an oligonucleotide S-GTGGCAAGGCTATTTGTCAAAGGGAAAATAA-3 ' ( Fig .
1A ) .
DNA transfection assays .
Transfections of cells were carried out with 10 pg of IgH enhancer/A56 plasmid , using the DEAE-dextran method ( 16 , 29 ) .
NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method ( 16 , 29 ) .
The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection , and 30 to 100 ug of heat-inactivated ( 16 ) cell extract was assayed for CAT activity as described previously ( 11 ) in a 1-h incubation at 37°C .
Transfections for every construct were performed independently in duplicate and repeated two to four times .
Samples were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography ( 11 ) .
The percentage of acetylated chloramphenicol was determined by cutting out nonacetylated and acetylated forms of chloramphenicol and measuring the amount of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting .
DNase I footprinting analysis .
460/A56 and L460 uB_-/ A56 ( Fig .
1 and 2 ) were linearized with HindIII , dephospho-rylated , and end labeled with [ y-*P ] JATP and T4 polynucle-otide kinase at the 5 ' end of the noncoding strand .
After digestion with Sal , end-labeled p460 and 1460 B-HindlII-Sall fragments were gel purified .
DNase I footprinting was performed as described by Jones et al .
( 12 ) , using 0.3 to 0.8 ng of end-labeled IgH enhancer fragments ( 5,000 cpm ) , 20 ug of total nuclear extract , 3 ug of heparin-agarose-purified nuclear extract , or no protein , 1 g of poly ( dI-dC ) for total nuclear extract and 0.2 pug for heparin-agarose fractions , and 2 % polyvinyl alcohol in 50 pl .
A ladder of G+A Maxam-Gilbert ( 21 ) sequence reaction of the labeled IgH enhancer fragments was run as a marker .
RESULTS Lymphoid-specific transcription of the IgH enhancer is for the most part dependent on two enhancer elements , OCTA and pB .
The pB site ( Fig .
1A ) was identified as a putative lymphoid-specific enhancer element ( 1 ) along with the OCTA motif ( 16 ) .
To study these enhancer elements , we introduced mutations in the B , OCTA and E3 sites by using synthetic oligonucleotides ( Fig .
1A ) .
Wild-type and mutant IgH enhancers as well as fragments thereof ( Fig .
2 ) were cloned into the Sa/I site just upstream of the truncated c-fos promoter of the AS6 plasmid ( 10 , 16 ) in the B orientation ( Fig .
1B ) .
We measured enhancer activity as the ability of the different enhancer constructs to induce transcription of the CAT gene after transient expression in a variety of cell types .
The full-length 700-bp IgH enhancer ( 700 WT ) stimulated transcription 50-fold in $ 194 myeloma cells and 20-fold in PD31 pre-B lymphoid cells ( Fig .
2 , line 1 ) relative to the level of the control plasmid ( Fig .
2 , line 14 ) .
The transcriptional activities of mutant enhancers were compared with the level of either the full-length or partial fragments of the wild-type 700-bp IgH enhancer ( 700 WT ) Vor .

CAT values are averages derived from one representative experiment of two independent transfections .
Repeated experiments gave similar results , with deviations of less than 20 % compared with the values given .
ENH~ ( line 14 ) indicates the enhancerless A56 background plasmid .
( Fig .
2 to 4 ) .
The 3 ' 300-bp part of the IgH enhancer ( L300 WT ) , which lacks El and E2 , expressed 8.4- and 3.2-times-higher CAT activity than did 1700 WT in $ 194 and PD31 cells , respectively ( Fig .
2 , line 5 ) .
However , in the A orientation ( 16 ) , 700 expressed much higher activity than did 1300 ( data not shown ) .
Mutation in the OCTA motif within L700 ( 700 OT ) reduced CAT activity in $ 194 myeloma cells by only about 40 % ( Fig .
2 , line 2 ; Fig .
3A ) but had a very small effect in the pre-B-cell line PD31 ( Fig .
2 , line 2 ; Fig .
3B ) , suggesting the presence of lymphoid-specific enhancer elements in 1700 independent of OCTA ( 16 ) .
We therefore tested the effect of a mutation in the wB DNA motif on enhancer activity .
Mutation in the B motif within 700 ( 1.700 wB~ ) resulted in a decrease of about 55 % in both $ 194 and PD31 cells ( Fig .
2 , line 3 ; Fig .
3A and B ) .
Interestingly , mutation in the wB DNA motif had an even more drastic effect on transcription of 700 in a very early pre-B-cell line , HAFTL , in which the wB~ mutation reduced CAT activity by more than 80 % ( Fig .
3C ) .
By contrast , the OCTA mutation had only a slight effect in this cell line ( Fig .
3C ) .
These results suggest that the wB site encodes an IgH enhancer element that may be more important for transcriptional activity in cells early in the B-lymphoid lineage .
By contrast , OCTA appears to play a larger role in the more mature cells .
Strikingly , combined mutation of both the mB and OCTA motifs ( 700 O~ BT ) led to severe decreases in CAT activity in all types of B cells ( Fig .
2 , line 4 ; Fig .
3 ) .
These effects were more dramatic than either mutation alone , reflecting a requirement for both wB and OCTA .
In $ 194 and PD31 cells , residual enhancer activities of 15 and 25 % of 700 WT activity , respectively , were observed even when both B and OCTA sites were mutated .
Thus , further enhancer elements present in the IgH enhancer must be active .
Similar results were obtained when mutating the OCTA or pB motif in the context of the 300 enhancer fragment ( Fig .
1 , from the Pvull to EcoRI sites ) , which lacks E1 , E2 , and other putative upstream elements ( Fig .
2 , lines 5 to 8 ; Fig .
3 ) .
As for 1700 , mutations in wB always had a stronger effect on transcription than did mutations in OCTA ( Fig .
2 , lines 5 to 7 ; Fig .
3 ) .
This was particularly evident in PD31 cells , in which mutation in B decreased CAT activity by more than 10-fold , whereas mutation in OCTA led to only a 2-fold decrease ( Fig .
3B ) .
Double mutation in both wB and OCTA within 300 , similar to 700 , caused greater decreases in transcription than either alone in $ 194 , PD31 , and HAFTL cells ( Fig .
2 , line 8 ; Fig .
3 ) .
To assess the functional consequence of the removal of the whole 3 ' end of the enhancer , containing both E4 and OCTA , we created p460 ( Fig .
2 , lines 9 and 10 ) .
This deletion led to a drastic reduction of transcription to 13.5 % of the level of 1700 WT in $ 194 cells , suggesting that important sites other than OCTA are removed by this deletion ( Fig .
2 , line 9 ) .
Alterations in the wB motif within this construct abrogated all enhancer activity in $ 194 cells ( Fig .
2 , lines 9 and 10 ) .
Thus , even though 1460 contains several E-box elements ( El , E2 , and E3 ) , mutation of mB alone drastically reduces the transcriptional activity of 1460 .
This context illustrates most vividly the importance of the pB site for the IgH enhancer .
mB needs a second enhancer element for its function .
Because alteration of the B site in 1460 suggested that this site might be the crucial enhancer element in this fragment , we made further truncations of the IgH enhancer .
70 WT , containing only the E3 and B motifs as identified enhancer elements but lacking El , E2 , E4 , and OCTA , expressed transcriptional activity similar to that of 460 in $ 194 cells ( Fig .
2 , lines 9 and 11 ) .
Mutation of either the E3 or wB site abolished enhancer activity of p70 in $ 194 cells ( Fig .
2 , lines 11 to 14 ) .
Because alteration of E3 had the same effect as 3158 LIBERMANN ET AL .

Effects of mutations on IgH enhancer transcription rate .
The 700 and 300 IgH enhancers with mutations in either OCTA ( 07 ) or wB ( BT ) were tested in $ 194 myeloma ( A ) , PD31 pre-B ( B ) , and HAFTL early pre-B ( C ) cells .
In each experiment , each value is the average of two representative independent transfections ; repeated experiments gave similar results in which the standard deviations were less than 20 % compared with the values given .
Absolute percent conversions of chloramphenicol to acetylated forms were as follows : 700 WT , 7.6 % for $ 194 , 4.4 % for PD31 , and 1.8 % for HAFTL ; £300 WT , 63.8 % for $ 194 , 14 % for PD31 , and 2.4 % for HAFTL ( the CAT assays with 300 were repeated for $ 194 cells with less cell extract in order to keep a linear range of chloramphenicol substrate conversion , resulting in conversion of 29.4 % for £300 WT ) ; and ENH ~ , 0.15 % for $ 194 , 0.22 % for PD31 , and 0.26 % for HAFTL .
Activity is given as percent relative CAT activity of the wild-type IgH enhancer fragment .
Hatched columns represent the parental enhancerless plasmid ; dotted columns represent plasmids containing various versions of the enhancer .
mutating pB in this fragment , the simplest explanation is that pB does not function by itself but requires a second enhancer element such as E3 .
To test this possibility , we constructed a synthetic 34-bp oligonucleotide containing the B motif and its flanking region but lacking E3 .
We inserted one , two , or four copies of this oligonucleotide into the AS6 plasmid .
In contrast to the p70 fragment , no enhancer activity , even with four copies of the mB oligonucleotide , was detected in $ 194 , PD31 , or HAFTL cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it appears that the mB element does not function independently as an enhancer but needs interaction with another enhancer element for activity .
pB and OCTA are not functional in fibroblasts .
To test whether pB is functional in nonlymphoid cells , we trans- fected the various constructs into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts .
All constructs derived from the 700 enhancer as well as the p70 constructs were inactive in NIH 3T3 cells .
w300 WT expressed low but reproducible enhancer activity ( Fig .
4 ) .
Mutation of the OCTA or mB site or a combination of both within 1300 resulted in a two- to threefold increase in CAT activity in NIH 3T3 cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
We have not further investigated the apparent inhibitory effects of these motifs in fibroblasts , but it is evident that the activation effects of the motifs are manifest specifically in B cells but not fibroblasts .
A lymphoid-specific protein binds to the B DNA motif .
To correlate the functional data described above with binding of a potential lymphoid-specific protein to the wB motif , we performed DNase I footprinting experiments using the 1460 Vor .

We compared nuclear extracts derived from lymphoid cells with extracts from nonlymphoid cells ( Fig .
5 and 6 ) .
Proteins bound to E2 and E3 were detected in extracts of both lymphoid ( $ 194 and BJAB ) and nonlymphoid ( U-C12:6 , 32D , NIH 3T3 , EJ , and HeLa ) cells ( Fig .
5 and 6A ) .
A strong footprint over the wB DNA motif was seen in extracts from the two lymphoid cell lines $ 194 ( murine myeloma ) and BJAB ( human B-cell lymphoma ) ( Fig .
5 , lanes 5 and 6 ; Fig .
6A , lane 3 ) .
No footprint over the pB site was observed with nuclear extracts from U-C12:6 , a human glioma ( Fig .
5 , lane 1 ) , NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts ( Fig .
5 , lane 3 ) , EJ human bladder carcinoma cells ( Fig .
5 , lane 4 ) , and HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells ( Fig .
6A , lane 2 ) .
The nuclear extract from the 32D myeloid precursor cell line protected a larger region around the wB site and had a unique enhanced band in the upper part of the pB site ( Fig .
5 , lane 2 ) .
Thus , the 32D nuclear factor ( s ) has properties very different from those of the B-cell factor .
Our results confirm that a lymphoid-specific factor or factors in both murine and human cells bind to the B motif .
Interestingly , we also detected a strong lymphoid-specific footprint between the E2- and E3-binding sites ( Fig .
5 ) which has not been previously observed .
This suggests the possibility of additional lymphoid-specific enhancer elements in the IgH enhancer ( T. Libermann and D. Baltimore , unpublished results ) .
To confirm that mutation in wB decreased binding of the lymphoid-specific factor , we carried out DNase I footprinting experiments comparing the wild-type 460 WT with the mutant 460 wB~ enhancer .
Heparin-agarose fractions of nuclear extracts derived from HeLa and BJAB cells were used for this experiment .
Again , only the BJAB B-cell line , not the HeLa carcinoma cell line , extract gave rise to a footprint over the mB site in the wild-type enhancer ( Fig .
6A ) .
The mutant uB site gave a different DNase digestion pattern , but it was clear that no protection was detected over the altered pB site with an extract from BJAB cells ( Fig .
6B ) .
A weak footprint that included the mutant pB site was created by the HeLa extract , but this has not been further studied ( Fig .
6B ) .
These results have been confirmed by gel mobility shift assays ( Libermann and Baltimore , unpublished results ) .
Only a wild-type , not a mutant B , oligonucleotide forms a specific complex in B cells but not in glioma , epithelial , and fibroblast cells , and only the wild-type oligo- LYMPHOID-SPECIFIC ENHANCER ELEMENT IN IgH GENE 3159 NIH 3T 3 No Protein G+A W O BJAB $ 194 32D ee rA CL 359 & 7 | 5 | ( - 383 pay w* wit wat - | ses & ry 401 C3 # m wag a** crn a C —r ‘ —408 # s = AL-414 € is - as is LB 4-42 C1 FR mm z -440 | | i- 454 a ?

two enhancer elements , B and OCTA .
In contrast to OCTA ( 45 ) , however , the wB element by itself does not express enhancer activity but needs interaction with another element to function .
Our results indicate that the mB site , together with the OCTA site and probably others , determines the tissue-restricted expression of the IgH gene .
Our purpose in undertaking these studies was to define more completely which enhancer elements contribute to the lymphoid-restricted expression of the IgH gene .
The pB motif manifests features of a second lymphoid-specific element in the IgH enhancer .
Nevertheless , combined mutation of both the B and OCTA sites leaves considerable residual enhancer activity that can only be explained by the action of further enhancer elements , possibly the E boxes ( 6 , 8 , 16 , 34 , 43 ) .
Indeed , preliminary evidence suggests that an mRNA coding for an E-box-binding protein is preferentially expressed in B cells ( C. Murre and D. Baltimore , unpublished results ) .
B-cell specificity of the IgH gene is apparently regulated by both positive-acting B-cell-specific enhancer elements and negative-acting non-B-lymphoid-specific elements .
Indeed , recent evidence suggests that repression of the IgH enhancer plays a role in silencing of the enhancer in non-B cells ( 30 , 44 ) .
Two negative elements that flank the 700-bp IgH enhancer have been identified and might be related to matrix attachment points ( 30 ) .
It is therefore not surprising that a 300-bp fragment of the IgH enhancer ( 300 ) is somewhat transcriptionally active in nonlymphoid cells , whereas the whole 700 IgH enhancer is inactive in nonlymphoid cells ( 16 ) .
An apparent negative element has been located to a region between the E1 and E2 enhancer elements ( 44 ) .
This negative element suppresses enhancer activity in non-B cells and is absent in the 300 fragment ( 44 ) .
However , even the 300-bp fragment which lacks identified negative elements appears to be a very weak enhancer in NIH 3T3 cells if compared with B cells .
Mutation of either the OCTA or wB site leads to increased activity of 300 in NIH 3T3 cells , suggesting that factors binding to these sites in NIH 3T3 cells might repress rather than enhance activity .
Another less likely explanation might be that mutation of these sites allows binding of positive factors to the mutated sites that are specific for NIH 3T3 cells .
Negative regulation may contribute to lymphoid specificity of the IgH enhancer .
However , positive-acting lymphoid-specific elements are essential to explain all aspects of lymphoid-specific IgH enhancer expression .
Mutation in the OCTA site within 300 did not lead to as drastic a decrease in transcriptional activity as previously reported ( 16 ) but reduced CAT activity by only 50 to 60 % in different B-cell lines .
This discrepancy might be due to the use of different cell lines in the previous report .
More important , mutation of the pB site in all cell lines revealed a greater decrease in transcription than did mutation in the OCTA site .
This difference was independent of the length of IgH enhancer fragment tested .
This difference was particularly striking in the pre-B-cell line PD31 and might be due to different amounts of NF-pB and Oct-2 protein in PD31 pre-B cells and $ 194 myeloma cells .
PD31 cells might contain relatively more NF-pB than $ 194 cells .
Interestingly , in the B orientation L300 expressed much higher transcriptional activity than did 700 , whereas in the A orientation L700 was more active than 300 .
This effect might be due to the difference in activity of the various enhancer elements dependent on the distance to the c-fos promoter .
In the B orientation but not in the A orientation , E3 , pB , and OCTA Vor .
10 , 1990 are closer to the transcription initiation point in 300 than in L700 .
Using the DNase I footprinting technique , we have demonstrated specific binding of a nuclear factor or factors , termed NF-pB , to the B site of the murine IgH enhancer .
NF-uB seems to be present only in B-lymphoid and some T-lymphoid ( unpublished results ) cells as well as in macro-phage cell lines ( unpublished results ) of both human and mouse origin but is absent in fibroblasts , epithelial cells , and glial cells .
Partial protection of the wB site was also detected in nuclear extracts from the myeloid precursor cell line 32D , even though the footprint pattern over the mB site was strikingly different from that created by nuclear extracts from lymphoid cells .
This finding suggests the presence of a factor related but not identical to NF-uB .
Both DNase I footprinting analysis and gel mobility shift experiments ( unpublished results ) have confirmed that the mutant mB site is unable to bind NF-uB .
Unexpectedly , we observed an additional putative lymphoid-specific footprint in the region between the ubiquitously protected E2 and E3 sites , raising the possibility that a third lymphoid-specific enhancer element is present in the IgH enhancer .
We have preliminary evidence that this new site is indeed a functional enhancer ( Libermann and Baltimore , unpublished results ) .
Lymphoid-specific protection over the mB site has been previously suggested by the experiments of Ephrussi et al .
( 8 ) with in vivo experiments and by Augereau and Chambon ( 2 ) with in vitro DNase footprinting .
Araki et al .
( 1 ) have recently reported the purification of a nuclear protein from a murine myeloma that binds to a site of the human IgH enhancer that is homologous to the murine IgH enhancer wB site , although the murine mB sequence differs in 4 of 16 nucleotides from the human pB-like site .
We now demonstrate that the murine pB site has features resembling the human homolog ( see also Nelsen et al .
[ 24 ] ) .
Thus , like the OCTA motif , the B motif and its factor are important elements of the IgH enhancer that are apparently conserved between species .
Araki et al .
( 1 ) showed that their factor is capable of inducing transcription of the human IgH gene when introduced into mouse L cells containing a transfected rearranged IgH gene .
Nuclear extracts from nonlymphoid cell lines were unable to induce high expression of the IgH gene in L cells .
Our mutational analysis of the mB motif in the murine IgH enhancer provides evidence that the murine pB site has features similar to the human homolog .
Our results show directly that the mB motif plays a crucial role in IgH enhancer activity and together with the DNase footprinting experiments support the notion that the wB motif acts as a lymphoid-specific enhancer component .
Indeed , the wB motif appears to have a stronger effect on IgH enhancer transcription in pre-B cells than does the OCTA element .
There is an important difference between the function of the OCTA and the B elements .
The OCTA motif acts as a lymphoid-specific enhancer independently of other enhancer elements ( 45 ) , whereas even a tetramer of the mB motif is completely devoid of enhancer activity in a variety of cell lines tested .
Nevertheless , transcription of a small 70-bp fragment of the IgH enhancer that contains the E3 and mB sites works as an enhancer element and is dependent on the integrity of the mB site .
There are several explanations for the lack of independent enhancer activity of the mB element .
( i ) We might have missed part of the NF-uB-binding site when constructing the oligonucleotide .
This is unlikely , because our oligonucleotide contains flanking regions on LYMPHOID-SPECIFIC ENHANCER ELEMENT IN IgH GENE 3161 both ends extending well over the putative binding site described by Araki et al .
( 1 ) for the human wB-like element and functionally defined by Nelsen et al .
( 24 ) .
( ii ) The pB motif is inactive in the context of the c-fos promoter/CAT construct .
This is also unlikely , because the wB element acts as an enhancer in this plasmid in the context of other IgH enhancer elements .
( iii ) The spacing of the B motifs in the multimers does not allow `` productive `` NF-puB binding to the element .
At present we have no evidence against or for this possibility .
( iv ) Interactions between NF-puB and proteins binding to additional enhancer elements are needed for the function of the wB element , or NF-uB binds only after modulation of the B site by an additional enhancer element .
Our results support this explanation , because alteration of either the pB or the E3 site within the 70 IgH enhancer fragment abolished most if not all enhancer activity of this fragment .
Whether E3 is the only enhancer element that directly interacts with B we do not yet know .
Also , it is not clear whether NF-pB and NF-uE3 can directly interact .
Interestingly , Meyer and Neuberger ( 22 ) have recently identified an enhancer 3 ' of the immunoglobulin k gene that contains a pB-like sequence flanked by an E3-like motif , albeit in orientation inverse to that of the IgH enhancer .
The novel immunoglobulin xk enhancer they describe also contains a sequence similar to that of the new enhancer element found between E2 and E3 in the IgH enhancer ( Libermann and Baltimore , unpublished results ) .
Interactions between different enhancer elements are likely to be important , as shown by the lack of demonstrable activity of wB oligonu-cleotides .
The mechanism by which other enhancer elements and their associated binding proteins modulate the transcriptional effect of the mB motif will be an interesting area for future research .
