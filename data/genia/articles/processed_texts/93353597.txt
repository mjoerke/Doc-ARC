9 Chronic Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Infection Stimulates Distinct NF- « xB/re/ DNA Binding Activities in Myelomonoblastic Cells ANNE ROULSTON , * PIERRE BEAUPARLANT , *2 NANCY RICE , `` anp JOHN HISCOTT_** Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research , Sir Mortimer B.

Chronic infection of PLB-985 cells led to increased monocyte-specific surface marker expression , increased c-fms gene transcription , and morphological alterations consistent with differentiation along the monocytic pathway .
PLB-IIIB cells displayed a constitutive NF- « B-like binding activity that was distinct from that induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment of the parental PLB-985 cell line .
This unique DNA binding activity consisted of proteins of 70 , 90 , and 100 kDa with a high degree of binding specificity for the NF- « B site within the PRDII domain of beta interferon .
In this report , we characterize the nature of these proteins and demonstrate that binding of these proteins is also induced following Sendai paramyxovirus infection .
The 70-kDa protein corresponds to the NF- « cB RelA ( p65 ) subunit , which is activated in response to an acute paramyxovirus infection or a chronic HIV-1 infection .
Virus infection does not appear to alter the amount of RelA ( p65 ) or NFKB1 ( p50 ) but rather affects the capacity of IBa to sequester RelA ( p65 ) , therefore leading to constitutive levels of RelA DNA binding activity and to increased levels of NF-B-dependent gene activity .
The virally induced 90- to 100-kDa proteins have a distinct binding specificity for the PRDII domain and an AT-rich sequence but do not cross-react with NF- « B subunit-specific antisera directed against NFKBI1 ( p105 or p50 ) , NFKB2 ( p100 or pS2 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , or c-re/ .
DNA binding of the 90- to 100-kDa proteins was not inhibited by recombinant IBao/MAD-3 and was resistant to tryptic digestion , suggesting that these proteins may not be NF- « B related .
Transient cotransfection experiments demonstrated that RelA and NFKB1 expression maximally stimulated HIV-1 LTR- and NF-B-dependent reporter genes ; differences in NF-xB-like binding activity were also reflected in higher constitutive levels of NF-xB-regulated gene expression in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells .
CD4* cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage , including myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow , can be infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) ( 14 , 53 ) ; these cells may serve as intracellular reservoirs for virus and contribute to the spread of HIV-1 to peripheral tissues , such as the skin , lungs , brain , and lymph nodes ( 39 ) .
One of the physiological consequences associated with HIV-1 infection of monocytic cells is altered regulation of inflammatory cytokine production ( 12 , 13 , 54 ) ; alterations in the expression of cytokines in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells may involve either increased or decreased cytokine levels , depending on a number of interrelated variables : the inducing agent , the cell types used in the study , and the state of differentiation of the cells .
Conversely , cytokines exert differential effects on HIV-1 gene expression ; interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-3 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor alpha/beta ( TNF- « / B ) , and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) have been shown to stimulate HIV-1 replication , whereas alpha/beta interferon ( IFN- « a/B ) decreases HIV-1 activity ( 49 ) .
Cytokines have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of AIDS-associated malignancies , such as Kaposi 's sarcoma and B-cell lymphoma ( 20 ) , and may contribute to fever , cachexia , and other clinical symptoms ( 7 , 40 ) .
* Corresponding author .
5235 One pathway by which cytokine expression and viral gene expression may be coordinately regulated is through the activation of the NF- « B/rel family of transcription factors ( reviewed in references 4 , 8 , and 9 ) .
NF- « B/rel participates in the activation of many immunoregulatory cytokine genes and cell surface receptors .
In addition , several viral enhanc-ers , including those of cytomegalovirus , simian virus 40 , and HIV-1 , contain NF- « B recognition sites .
The consensus recognition site is a decamer with two pentameric half sites , each of which participates in the recognition and stabilization of the binding of the NF- « B dimer ( 70 ) .
While constitutive NF- « B binding activity has been detected in mature B cells and monocytes ( 23 , 50 ) , NF- « B expression is inducible in most cell types by viruses , double-stranded RNA , bacterial lipopolysaccharides , cyto-kines , phorbol esters , and oxygen radical intermediates ( 26 , 37 , 62 , 63 ) .
NF- « B was initially described as two subunits , p50 ( NFKB1 ) and p65 ( RelA ) , that existed in the cytoplasm in a latent form complexed to an inhibitory subunit , IB .
Induction resulted in the release of IxB from p50-p65 and nuclear translocation of the DNA binding heterodimer ( 3 , 18 ) .
It is now apparent that NF- « B proteins constitute a family of transcription factors whose genes share homology in the N-terminal DNA binding domain with the c-re/ proto-oncogene and with the Drosophila morphogen dorsal ( 4 , 8 , 9 , 21 ) .
5236 ROULSTON ET AL .
The family includes several members : NFKB1 ( p50 ) is synthesized as a 105-kDa non-DNA binding precursor that is proteolytically cleaved to yield the mature p50 product ( 10 , 19 , 32 , 41 ) .
The RelA ( p65 ) protein contains in addition to the N-terminal rel homology domain a trans-activation domain in its C-terminal portion ( 21 , 45 , 56 ) .
Recently , an alternatively spliced form of RelA , termed AReIA ( p6SA ) , was identified ; it inhibits NF- « B binding activity and has a distinct trans-dominant negative effect on transcription ( 43 , 58 ) .
c-rel ( p85 ) is the cellular homolog of v-re/ , the transforming gene of the reticuloendotheliosis virus , an avian retrovirus that induces acute fatal lymphoma in young birds ( 9 ) .
The NFKB2 ( p100 , p52 , and lyt-10 ) gene encodes a 100-kDa precursor ( p100 ) and a 52-kDa product and corresponds to lyt-10 , originally identified in a chromosomal translocation associated with B-cell lymphoma ( 44 , 60 ) .
Recently , a 68-kDa protein referred to as relB ( I-rel ) was cloned ; relB appears to form activating heterodimers with the p50 protein ( 57 , 59 ) .
Multiple ankyrin repeat-containing IxB proteins that regulate cytoplasmic anchoring and nuclear uptake of NF- « B proteins have also been defined ( 4 , 8 , 9 ) : IxBa ( MAD-3/pp40/ RL/IF-1 ) , cloned as an immediate-early gene in monocytes ( 25 ) , interacts with high affinity with RelA and inhibits NFKB1 ( p50 ) -RelA ( p65 ) or NFKB2 ( p52 ) -RelA heterodimers and RelA ( p65 ) homodimers ; IxBa is also capable of interacting with NFKB1 ( p50 ) and c-re/ with low affinity ( 6 ) .
The association of IxBa with NF- « B proteins occurs via the nuclear localization sequence , and in the uninduced state , IxB masks the nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) to prevent nuclear translocation ( 6 , 29 , 31 , 72 ) .
Bcel3 ( and ABcI3 ) is the product of a gene associated with the t ( 14 ; 19 ) chromosomal translocation in chronic lymphocytic leuke-mia .
Bcl3 specifically inhibits the DNA binding activity of NFKB1 ( p50 ) or NFKB2 ( p52 ) homodimers ( 15 , 30 , 71 ) .
IxBy is a murine 70-kDa protein derived from the carboxy-terminal 607 amino acids of p105 by alternative splicing .
This protein inhibits the DNA binding of NFKB1 ( p50 ) -RelA heterodimers , NFKB1 ( p50 ) homodimers , and c-re/ ( 27 ) .
Recently , the p105 precursor itself was shown to inhibit the nuclear translocation of c-rel and RelA ; additionally , p105 generates nuclear RelA-p50 and p50-c-rel complexes through proteolytic processing ( 51 ) .
Several studies have now examined the relationship among HIV-1 infection of myeloid cells , induction of NF- « B binding activity ( 2 , 23 , 47 , 50 , 64 ) , cellular differentiation ( 1 , 17 , 46 ) , and HIV-1 gene expression ( 38 , 67 ) .
Previously , we established a population of HIV-1-infected myelomonoblastic cells ( PLB-IIIB ) derived from the PLB-985 cell line ( 55 ) .
Chronic infection of PLB-985 cells led to increased monocyte-specific surface marker expression , increased c-fms gene transcription , and morphological alterations consistent with differentiation along the monocytic pathway ( 55 ) .
PLB-IIIB cells displayed a constitutive NFKB-like binding activity consisting of proteins of 70 , 90 , and 100 kDa with a high degree of binding specificity for the NF- « B site within the PRDII domain of IFN-B ( P2 ) ( 55 ) .
In this report , we characterize the nature of these proteins and demonstrate that the binding of these proteins is also induced following Sendai paramyxovirus infection of PLB-985 cells .
The 70-kDa protein corresponds to 'the NF- « B RelA ( p65 ) subunit , which is specifically activated in response to a viral infection .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and transfections .
PLB-985 cells ( 66 ) were infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB as previously described by use of supernatants from HIV-l-infected U937 cells to establish the chronically infected PLB-IIIB cell line ( 55 ) .
PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 ( GIBCO , Life Technologies Inc. , Grand Island , N.Y. ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Hyclone , Logan , Utah ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 20 pg of gentamicin ( Schering Canada , Pointe Claire , Quebec , Canada ) per ml .
Exponentially growing cells were treated as follows , depending on the individual experimental protocol : addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) at a final concentration of 25 ng/ml ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , Mo . )
; addition of TNF-a at 100 U/ml ( Genzyme Inc. , Kneeland , Mass . )
; and priming with IFN- « 2 ( a gift from Schering Canada ) for 4 h at 250 U/ml and then Sendai virus infection at 1,000 hemag-glutination units ( HAU ) /ml ( Sendai virus was a kind gift from Kari Cantell ) .
PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran procedure as previously described ( 24 ) .
Cells were induced 24 h later and harvested 36 h following transfection , protein was collected , and protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay .
The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter constructs [ HIV-LTR , P2 ( 2 ) , 5 ' « B ( 3 ) , and HIV mut ] were described previously ( 26 , 37 ) .
The NF- « B expression plasmids were produced by subcloning different NF- « B genes into the SVK3 vector : ( i ) for NFKBI1 ( p50 ) , a 1,381-bp EcoRI-Rsal fragment from KBF-1 ( 32 ) was subcloned into the EcoRI-Smal site of SVK3 ; ( ii ) for AReIA ( p65A ) , a 2,572-bp Xbal-Xhol fragment from plasmid BL-SK ( 58 ) was subcloned into the BamHI-Xhol site of SVK3 ; ( iii ) for c-re/ , a 2,340-bp EcoRI fragment of c-rel cDNA ( 11 ) was cloned into the SVK3 EcoRI site ; and ( iv ) for IxBa , a 1,190-bp EcoRI fragment from pGEX-2T ( see below ) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of SVK3 .
The CMIN-p65 vector ( 58 ) was used to express the RelA ( p65 ) subunit .
CAT activity was measured with 80 pug of protein assayed for 2 h at 37°C as described by Gorman et al .
( 22 ) .
The percent acetylation was determined , and the relative inducibility was obtained by dividing the percent conversion of treated samples by that of untreated samples .
Expression and purification of recombinant proteins .
The cDNA clone encoding p105 was obtained from A. Israel , and the region corresponding to p50 nucleotides 211 to 1687 ( encoding amino acids 10 to 502 of p105 ) ( 32 ) was inserted into the pGEX-3X expression vector ( Pharmacia ) .
The cDNA encoding IxBa/MAD-3 was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of total cellular RNA from Jurkat cells with specific primers corresponding to nucleotides 81 to 99 ( 5-ACGTGAATTCAGCTGGTC CGCGCC-3 ' ) and 1151 to 1171 ( 5'-ATATAGGTGTGACGT GTGACCTTAAG-3 ' ) , which encompassed the entire coding region of MAD-3 ( 25 ) .
The 5 ' end of each oligonucleotide primer contained an EcoRI site used for ligation of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA into the pGEX-2T expression vector ( Pharmacia ) .
Both fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli ( DHSa ; GIBCO/ BRL ) following 3 h of induction with 1 mM isopropyl-B-D- Vor .
67 , 1993 thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) ( Pharmacia ) at 30°C .
Protein was isolated following bacterial lysis by six 30-s cycles of sonication in lysis buffer : 20 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.4 ) , 0.2 mM EDTA , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 mM dithio-threitol .
After ammonium sulfate precipitation ( 30 % satura-tion ) , proteins were resolubilized in lysis buffer containing 1 % Triton X-100 and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads ( Pharmacia ) for 20 min .
After a rinse with phosphate-buffered saline , fusion proteins were enzymatically cleaved as follows : p50 , in 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) -150 mM NaCl-1 mM CaCl ; -factor Xa ( Boehringer GmbH , Mannheim , Ger-many ) ; and IxBa , in 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) -150 mM NaCl-2.5 mM CaCl , ; -thrombin ( Sigma ) for 3 to 4 h at room temperature .
The final cleaved protein products were eluted from the beads with 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) -150 mM NaCl and stored with the addition of 1 mM dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors .
WCE preparations .
Whole-cell extracts ( WCE ) were prepared from untreated PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells or from cells treated with PMA ( 25 ng/ml for 4 or 16 h ) or TNF-a ( 100 U/ml for 4 or 16 h ) or primed with IFN-a2 ( 250 IU/ml for 4 h ) and infected with Sendai virus ( 1,000 HAU/ml for 6 h ) .
Procedures for extract preparation were those described previously ( 35 ) .
EMSA .
Cell extracts ( 2.5 to 5.0 ug ) were preincubated with the nonspecific DNA competitor poly ( dI-dC ) ( 5 ug ; Pharmacia ) for 10 min on ice in a total volume of 15 to 20 ul of WCE buffer containing 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 ( 35 ) .
Binding activity was assessed with 0.2 ng of *°P-end-labelled probes that corresponded to the PRDII domain of the IFN-B promoter ( 5-GGGAAATTCCGGGAAATTCC-3 ' ) , the HIV-1 enhancer and a nonspecific AT-rich oligonucleotide ( 5'-AAATTTAA ATITAAATTTAAATTT-3 ' ) and that were incubated with extracts for 30 min at room temperature .
Protein-DNA complexes were then separated on a 5 % native polyacrylamide gel ( 60:1 cross-link ) with Tris-glycine ( 25 mM Tris , 195 mM glycine [ pH 8.5 ] ) .
In the competition analysis , a 125 M excess of unlabelled oligonucleotide was incubated with WCE for 10 min on ice prior to the addition of the probe .
For examination of the individual proteins present in the complex , polyclonal subunit-specific antisera against p50 or p105 ( antiserum 1141 , N-terminus specific ) ( 51 ) , RelA ( antiserum 1226 , C-terminus specific ) ( 51 ) , c-rel ( antiserum 265 , C-terminus specific ) ( 11 ) , and p52 or p100 ( antiserum 1267 , N-terminus specific ) were used in combination with the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
Antisera ( 1:10 ) were incubated with WCE ( 2.5 pg ) in the presence or absence of a specific competitor peptide ( 0.1 pug/pl ) for 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of poly ( dI-dC ) and radiolabelled probe as described for the EMSA .
Immunoprecipitation of RelA and IxBa .
PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline , resuspended in methionine-free RPMI 1640 for 1 h , and labelled for 3 h with 0.5 mCi of Trans*°S label ( ICN ) per ml .
Preparation of cell lysates , preclearing with normal rabbit serum , and immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies were carried out essentially as described previously ( 51 ) .
UV cross-linking analysis .
UV cross-linking analysis was performed in situ with a bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) -substi-tuted *°P-labelled P2 probe in a standard mobility shift analysis , scaled up twofold and then continued as previously described ( 34 ) .
Tryptic digestion of protein-DNA complexes .
Tryptic digestion was performed by incubating recombinant p50 ( 50 ng ) or WCE ( 5 pg ) in 10 ug of tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloro- INDUCTION OF NF- « B ACTIVITY BY VIRUS INFECTION 5237 P2 probe Treatment : CP go CP .o QQV « V\ « \6 Q “ ?

NF- « B binding activities following PMA , TNF-a , or virus induction .
A mobility shift analysis of proteins binding to the P2 probe was performed with extracts ( 5 g ) from PLB-985 ( lanes 1 to 4 ) and PLB-IIIB ( lanes 5 to 8 ) cells ; cells were left untreated ( lanes 1 and 5 ) or were treated with PMA for 16 h ( lanes 2 and 6 ) , IFN and Sendai virus for 6 h ( lanes 3 and 7 ) , or TNF-a for 16 h ( lanes 4 and 8 ) .

methyl ketone ( TPCK ) -trypsin ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) per ml for 1 , 4 , 15 , and 30 min at room temperature as described by Bacuerle and Baltimore ( 3 ) .
Digestion was stopped with a 10-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor ( GIBCO ) , and a mobility shift analysis was performed with the digested extracts .
RESULTS Virus infection induces unique NF- « B subunit combina-tions .
Tandem repeats of two different NF- « B binding sites ( the PRDII domain of IFN-B and the HIV-1 enhancer ) were used in mobility shift analyses to assess NF- « B binding activity in extracts from uninfected PLB-985 cells or PLB-985 cells chronically infected with HIV-1 ( PLB-IIIB ) .
With the P2 probe ( Fig .
1 ) , PLB-985 cells had almost no detectable DNA binding activity ( Fig .
1 , lane 1 ) , but following treatment with PMA or TNF-a for 4 h , NF- « B complexes were induced ( Fig .
1 , lanes 2 and 4 ) ; Sendai virus infection of PLB-985 cells for 6 h also induced an complex with a slightly higher mobility ( complex A ) ( Fig .
1 , lane 3 ) .
In extracts from chronically HIV-l-infected PLB-IIIB cells , complex A was constitutively present ( Fig .
1 , lane 5 ) ; treatment of PLB-IIIB cells with PMA or coinfection with Sendai virus increased complex A formation two- to threefold ( Fig .
1 , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
The specificity of these complexes for the NF- « B site was demonstrated previously in competition and binding site mutagenesis studies ( 55 ) .
Complex A was also detected within 5 days of de novo HIV-1 infection in PLB-985 cells ( data not shown ) .
Similar NF- « B complexes were obtained when the HIV-1 enhancer was used as a probe ( 55 ; see also Fig .
2C , lanes 1 and 6 ) .
Thus , distinct NF- « B-related activities observed in HIV-1-infected cells were induced not only by chronic HIV-1 infection but also by acute Sendai virus infection .

Identification of NF- « B DNA binding subunits .
WCE ( 2.5 ug ) from PMA-treated PLB-985 cells ( A ) or Sendai virus-infected PLB-985 cells ( B ) were preincubated with or without NF- « B-specific antisera ( indicated above the lanes ) for 10 min and then allowed to interact with a *°P-labelled P2 probe under standard EMSA conditions .
Antisera specific for N-terminal NF- « B p50 or p105 ( 1141 ) ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , C-terminal RelA ( 1226 ) ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , C-terminal c-re/ ( 265 ) ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , and N-terminal pS2 or lyt-10 ( 1267 ) ( lanes 9 and 10 ) were used ( 51 ) .
The specificity of the antibody-protein complex was confirmed by the addition of excess peptide as competitor ( lanes 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ) .
Similar analyses were performed with the HIV-1 probe ( C ) .
Extracts from PMA-treated PLB-985 cells ( lanes 1 to 5 ) and IFN-treated and Sendai virus-infected cells ( lanes 6 to 10 ) were preincubated with antisera to p50 ( lanes 2 , 3 , 7 , and 8 ) and RelA ( lanes 4 , 5 , 9 , and 10 ) .
was accompanied by the appearance of a shifted slowly migrating complex ; the addition of excess peptide used for antibody production inhibited the formation of the shifted complex , thus confirming the specificity of the antibody ( Fig .
2A , lane 4 ) .
No shifted complex was obtained with antisera to RelA or other subunits ( Fig .
2A , lanes 5 , 7 , and 9 ) ; the same results were obtained with extracts from TNF- « -treated PLB-985 cells ( data not shown ) .
In most lanes , a weak nonspecific shifted band that was also seen with preimmune serum ( Fig .
2A , lane 2 ) and that was not inhibited by the specific peptides used to prepare the antibodies ( Fig .
2A , lanes 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ) was observed .
In contrast , shifted complexes corresponding to both p50 and RelA were detected in extracts from Sendai virus-infected cells ( Fig .
2B , lanes 3 and 5 ) ; the addition of excess p50 or RelA peptide to the reactions completely inhibited the formation of the shifted antibody-protein-DNA complex ( Fig .
2B , lanes 4 and 6 ) .
No evidence for the involvement of Vor .

Immunoprecipitation of RelA and IxBa .
( A ) Immunoprecipitation of a virus-inducible 40-kDa protein by anti-RelA antiserum .
Cell lysates from PLB-985 cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and Sendai virus-infected PLB-985 cells ( lanes 3 and 4 ) were immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum ( lanes 1 and 3 ) and with anti-RelA antiserum ( lanes 2 and 4 ) .
PLB-985 cells ( 10 ' ) were infected with Sendai virus ( 100 HAU/m ! )
for 2 h. Cells were labelled for 3 h in methionine-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.5 mCi of Trans* `` $ label per ml .
At the end of the labelling , PLB-985 cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 ; after a 3-h chase , proteins were extracted and immunoprecipitated with preimmune ( PI ) serum and anti-RelA antiserum .
( B ) Coprecipitation of RelA with IxBa .
Extracts from PLB-985 ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and PLB-IIIB ( lanes 8 and 9 ) cells were labelled for 3 h in methionine-free RPMI 1640 ; proteins were extracted and immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum ( lanes 1 and 8 ) and with anti-I « Ba antiserum ( lanes 2 and 9 ) .
Extracts from PLB-985 ( lanes 3 to 7 ) and PLB-IIIB ( lanes 10 to 14 ) cells were also immunoprecipitated with anti-IxBa antiserum , and the precipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads and extensively washed .
Following boiling in 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-0.5 % B-mercaptoethanol , the initial precipitates were reprecipitated with antisera to IxBa ( lanes 3 and 10 ) , RelA ( lanes 4 and 11 ) , NFKBI1 ( p105 or p50 ) ( lanes 5 and 12 ) , and NFKB2 ( lyt-10 , p100 , or p52 ) ( lanes 6 and 13 ) and with preimmune ( PI ) serum ( lanes 7 and 14 ) .
The positions of molecular mass markers are indicated ( in kilodaltons ) ; the arrows indicate RelA ( p65 ) and IxBa .
c-rel or NFKB2 ( p100 or p52 ) protein in complex formation was obtained ( Fig .
2B , lanes 7 to 10 ) .
Similarly , shifted complexes corresponding to both p50 and RelA subunits were found in extracts from HIV-1-infected PLB-IIIB cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , in myeloblastic PLB-985 cells , NF- « B RelA DNA binding is specifically induced as a consequence of either acute Sendai virus infection or chronic HIV-1 infection .
The addition of anti-NFKB1 or anti-RelA antiserum did not result in the complete disappearance of the NF- « B complex , even with titration of the antiserum ( data not shown ) , suggesting that other DNA binding proteins unrelated to NF- « B may be present in the complex .
When the HIV-1 enhancer probe was used , anti-p50 completely inhibited the NF- « B complexes in both PMA-and Sendai virus-induced cell extracts and resulted in the formation of a shifted protein-DNA complex ( Fig .
2C , lanes 2 and 7 ) .
The addition of the p50 peptide used to produce the antiserum completely blocked the shift ( Fig .
2C , lanes 3 and 8 ) .
Again , NF- « B RelA DNA binding was stimulated only in virus-infected cells ( Fig .
2C , lane 9 ) .
Anti-ReIA antiserum resulted in the specific disappearance of the uppermost protein-DNA complex ; the addition of RelA peptide restored the uppermost complex ( Fig .
2C , lane 10 ) .
Since the upper complex also disappeared when anti-p50 antiserum was included in the reactions ( Fig .
2C , lane 7 ) , this complex represents a pS50-RelA heterodimer .
These data indicate that the proteins associated with the HIV-1 enhancer probe were mainly RelA and p50 , whereas the P2 probe interacted with RelA and p50 as well as other proteins .
Immunoprecipitation of RelA and IBa .
The relative amounts of RelA and NFKBI1 ( p50 ) were not increased in virus-infected PLB-985 cells , as determined by Western immunoblot analysis ( data not shown ) .
To assess whether a change in the association between RelA and IxBa may be responsible for constitutive NF- « B binding activity , coim-munoprecipitation was performed with extracts from uninfected and virus-infected PLB-985 cells and with anti-RelA and anti-IxBa antisera ( Fig .
3 ) .
PLB-985 cells were infected with Sendai virus and pulse labelled with [ *°SJmethionine for 3 h prior to preparation of cell lysates and immunoprecipitation with anti-RelA antiserum .
From PLB-985 cells , a protein of 68 kDa was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-RelA antiserum ( Fig .
3A , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) ; from 5240 ROULSTON ET AL .

UV cross-linking analysis of P2 binding proteins .
A mobility shift analysis scaled up twofold was performed with extracts from untreated PLB-985 ( lanes 1 to 3 ) , untreated PLB-IIIB ( lanes 7 to 10 ) , TNF- « -treated PLB-985 ( lanes 4 to 6 ) , or TNF- « -treated PLB-IIIB ( lanes 11 to 14 ) cells and a *°P-end-labelled BrdU-substituted probe .
The resolved complexes were UV irradiated in situ and excised ; proteins cross-linked to the labelled probe were then separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel .
The specificity of proteins binding to the P2 site was demonstrated by competition with a 125-fold excess of unlabelled HIV-1 enhancer ( lanes 2 , 5 , 8 , and 12 ) , P2 ( lanes 3 , 6 , 9 , and 13 ) or AT-rich ( lane 14 ) oligonucleotide in the binding reaction .
The positions of the molecular mass standards are indicated on the left , and the molecular masses of cross-linked proteins ( after subtraction of the contribution of the probe ) are indicated by arrows on the right ( both in kilodaltons ) .
Sendai virus-infected cells , the same amount of the 68-kDa protein was precipitated , but in addition , a 40-kDa protein was coprecipitated by anti-RelA antiserum ( Fig .
3A , compare lanes 3 and 4 ) .
The 40-kDa protein was independently precipitated by anti-IxBa antiserum ( Fig .
3B ) .
Similarly , from PLB-IIIB cells , anti-RelA antiserum specifically coprecipitated a RelA-IxBa complex ( data not shown ) .
When anti-IkBa antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate complexes from PLB-985 or PLB-IIIB cells , several additional proteins , of 50 to 60 kDa , were precipitated ( Fig .
3B , lanes 2 and 9 ) .
To identify these proteins , the immunoprecipitates were boiled and reprecipitated either with IxBa or different NF-KB antibodies .
RelA was the only NF- « B-specific protein coprecipitated with anti-IxBa antiserum from PLB-985 cells ( Fig .
3B , lanes 4 to 6 ) .
No detectable RelA was coprecipitated with anti-IxBa antiserum from PLB-IIIB cells ( Fig .
3B , lanes 11 to 13 ) .
These results suggest that a portion of IxBa is not complexed with RelA in PLB-IIIB cells and that the rate of IxBa synthesis is higher in virus-infected than uninfected cells .
Changes in the stability or phosphorylation of IxBa could result in the constitutive translocation of a fraction of RelA to the nucleus .
UV cross-linking analysis and sequence specificity of P2 binding proteins .
UV cross-linking analysis with a BrdU-substituted DNA probe was used to identify the individual proteins interacting with P2 .
Unstimulated cells did not contain detectable levels of NF- « B binding proteins in this assay ( Fig .
4 , lanes 1 to 3 ) ; however , complexes induced in response to TNF-a ( Fig .
4 , lanes 4 to 6 ) or PMA ( data not shown ) treatment resolved into two major proteins , of 40 and 50 kDa , and a minor protein , of 70 kDa ( Fig .
4 , lane 4 ) .
These proteins could be inhibited through competition by an excess of either P2 or HIV-1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
4 , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
In contrast , the DNA binding complex constitutively present in PLB-IIIB cells ( 55 ) and in Sendai virus-induced PLB-985 cells resolved into three proteins , of 70 , 90 , and 100 kDa ( Fig .
4 , lanes 7 to 10 ) .
These proteins exhibited a high degree of specificity for P2 and were inhibited through competition by an excess of unlabeled P2 probe ( Fig .
4 , lanes 9 and 13 ) but not the HIV-1 enhancer probe ( Fig .
4 , lanes 8 and 12 ) .
The 70-kDa protein was induced by TNF- « in HIV-1-infected cells ( Fig .
4 , compare lanes 7 and 11 ) , and its binding was specifically inhibited by the addition of IxBa ( data not shown ) .
The 70-kDa protein therefore appears to be the NF- « B RelA ( p65 ) subunit .
Thus , distinct proteins with specificity for the P2 NF- « B site appear to be induced by either HIV-1 or Sendai virus infection of PLB-985 cells .
Specific binding to an AT-rich oligonucleotide .
The P2 NF- « B site differs from the HIV-1 enhancer NF-KB site by only 2 bases , at positions 5 and 6 , resulting in a 5-bp central AT -rich region .
To determine whether virus-inducible complex A could bind to such an AT-rich site , cellular extracts from TNF- « -induced PLB-985 ( Fig .
5 , lanes 1 to 4 ) and PLB-IHIB ( Fig .
5 , lanes 5 to 8 ) cells were incubated with a radiolabelled AT -rich probe , either alone or with competitor DNA .
Interestingly , binding to the AT-rich probe was detected only in virus-infected cells ( Fig .
5 , lanes 1 and 4 ) ; the AT binding activity was specifically inhibited by the addition of excess P2 ( Fig .
5 , lane 7 ) or AT-rich ( Fig .
5 , lane 8 ) oligonucleotide but not HIV-1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
5 , lane 6 ) .
The same AT binding complex was also generated in extracts from Sendai virus-infected PLB-985 cells ( data not shown ) .
For determination of which proteins were involved in binding to this AT-rich region , competition analysis revealed that only the 90- to 100-kDa proteins could be specifically inhibited through competition by the addition of excess unlabelled AT -rich oligonucleotide ( Fig .
4 , lanes 10 and 14 ) .

Analysis of proteins binding to an AT-rich sequence .
Extracts from PLB-985 ( lanes 1 to 4 ) and PLB-IIIB ( lanes 5 to 8 ) cells treated for 4 h with TNF-a were incubated with a *°P-labelled AT -rich probe in the presence or absence of a 125-fold excess of unlabelled HIV-1 ( lanes 2 and 6 ) , P2 ( lanes 3 and 7 ) , or AT-rich ( lanes 4 and 8 ) oligonucleotide as a competitor .
Both the nonspecific ( ns ) band and the specific AT-rich complex are indicated with arrows .
species distinguishes them from the 70-kDa protein .
Further-more , the virus-induced complex binding to AT did not react with any NF- « B-specific antisera ( p105 or p50 , p100 or p52 , RelA , or c-rel ; data not shown ) .
Effect of rIxBa on DNA binding activity .
To determine whether protein complexes induced by TNF-a or viral infection could be inhibited by IxBa , recombinant IkBa ( rIxBa ) /MAD-3 was preincubated with extracts from PLB-985 or PLB-IIIB cells before binding to the P2 probe ( Fig .
6 ) .
rIkBa inhibited the TNF- « -induced NF-kB complexes in PLB-985 cells ( Fig .
6 , lane 2 ) but only partially decreased the level of complex A in PLB-IIIB cells ( Fig .
6 , lane 4 ) .
The protein-DNA complex formed with the AT-rich probe and extracts from PLB-IIIB cells ( Fig .
6 , lane 5 ) also was not inhibited by the addition of rikBa ( Fig .
6 , lane 6 ) .
This result also indicates that virus-induced complex A was not regulated by IxBa and may not be an complex .

Tryptic digestion analysis of proteins binding to P2 .
Previous studies demonstrated that NF-kB p50 had a trypsin-resistant core that maintained DNA binding specificity ( 3 ) .

the probe and as an additional test of the NF-KB relatedness of the AT-rich binding 90- to 100-kDa proteins , tryptic digestion analysis of the different complexes was performed ( Fig .

Recombinant p50 and extracts from TNF-a « -treated PLB-985 and PLB-IIIB cells were digested with trypsin for 1 to 30 min and then analyzed for DNA binding activity to P2 ( Fig .
7 , lanes 1 to 15 ) and AT-rich ( Fig .
7 , lanes 16 to 20 ) probes .
Purified recombinant p50 was reduced to a trypsin-resistant core in about 4 min ( Fig .
7 , lanes 1 to 5 ) , whereas the complexes from TNF- « @ -treated PLB-985 cells ( Fig .
7 , lanes 6 to 10 ) were degraded more slowly but also generated the trypsin-resistant core .
Interestingly , complexes from TNF- « -treated PLB-IIIB cells had trypsin-sensitive and trypsin-resistant components ( Fig .
7 , lanes 11 to 15 ) , consistent with the fact that a portion of these complexes corresponds to NF- « B and a portion corresponds to the 90- to 100-kDa species .
The protein complex that was from virus-infected cells and that specifically bound to AT-rich DNA was completely trypsin resistant ( Fig .
7 , lanes 16 to 20 ) .
As summarized in Table 1 , the 90- to 100-kDa proteins observed in chronically HIV-l-infected PLB-IIIB cells or in Sendai virus-infected PLB-985 cells possessed a number of features that distinguished them from the NF- « B-specific complexes observed in TNF- « - or PMA-induced PLB-985 cells .

Tryptic digestion of proteins binding to the P2 probe .
Proteins binding to P2 ( lanes 1 to 15 ) or to AT-rich ( lanes 16 to 20 ) sequences were analyzed by an EMSA following tryptic digestion .
Recombinant NF-kB p50 purified from E. coli ( lanes 1 to 5 ) and WCE from TNF-a ( 4-h ) -treated PLB-985 ( lanes 6 to 10 ) or PLB-IIIB ( lanes 11 to 20 ) cells were subjected to tryptic digestion analysis .
Protein-DNA complexes were either untreated ( lanes 1 , 6 , 11 , and 16 ) or treated with TPCK-trypsin for 1 min ( lanes 2 , 7 , 12 , and 17 ) , for 4 min ( lanes 3 , 8 , 13 , and 18 ) , for 15 min ( lanes 4 , 9 , 14 , and 19 ) , or 30 min ( lanes 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 ) , and then digestion was stopped by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor .
demonstrate the functional consequences of these distinct binding species in vivo , transient transfection assays were performed in PLB-985 cells , using NF- « B-driven constructs expressing the CAT reporter gene ( Fig .
8 ) .
Constructs consisted of the HIV-1 LTR linked to the CAT gene ( HIV-LTR ) , four copies of the PRDII/NF- « B site linked to the minimal simian virus 40 promoter [ P2 ( 2 ) ] , three copies of the HIV-1 enhancer [ 5 ' « B ( 3 ) ] , and a mutant HIV-1 enhancer ( HIV mut ) ( 26 , 37 ) .
Following DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection into PLB-985 cells , all constructs had a low level of activity ; for all plasmids except the HIV mut plasmid , PMA treatment at 24 h after transfection resulted in a 4- to 12-fold inducibility of CAT activity .
In contrast , when the same plasmids were introduced into PLB-IIIB cells , a high basal level of CAT activity was observed with the HIV-LTR , P2 ( 2 ) , and 5 ' « kB ( 3 ) plasmids ; this level of CAT activity was not increased significantly by PMA treatment of the cells .
The high level of CAT activity was due to functional NF-kB binding sites , since the HIV mut plasmid had a low basal level of activity and no inducible activity in PLB-IIIB cells .
In cotransfection experiments , the effects of overexpression of individual NF- « B subunits-NFKBI1 ( p50 ) , RelA , c-rel , AReIA , or NFKB1 ( p50 ) and RelA together-on HIV-LTR-or 5'kB ( 3 ) -dependent gene expression were measured in a Jurkat T-cell background ( Table 2 ) .
The expression of either RelA alone or RelA in combination with NFKB1 ( p50 ) stimulated the HIV-LTR , 5 ' « B ( 3 ) , and P2 ( 2 ) constructs but did not stimulate the HIV mut construct .
Taken together , these results indicate that alterations in the NF-kB binding activities observed in HIV-l-infected cells may result in higher levels of NF- « B-regulated gene activity .
DISCUSSION Two distinct types of virus infection-one an acute paramyxovirus infection and the other a chronic lentivirus infection-result in the appearance of multiple NF- « B-related protein-DNA complexes .
Chronic HIV-1 infection sustains constitutive levels of NF- « B-like DNA binding activity in the myeloid model of HIV-1 infection .
As summarized in Table 1 , virus infection by either Sendai virus or HIV-1 induced DNA binding complexes consisting of 70- , 90- , and 100-kDa proteins ; binding assays performed in the presence of subunit-specific antisera demonstrated that NFKB1 ( p50 ) and RelA ( p65 ) were present in the virus-induced complexes and bound to both HIV-1 enhancer and PRDII/NF- « B probes , although p50 was only weakly detected by cross-linking .
On the basis of antibody cross-reactivity , molecular weight , TNF inducibility and inhibition by rIkBa , the 70-kDa protein corresponds to RelA ( p65 ) .
Since the amounts of RelA and NFKB1 ( p50 ) proteins were not increased in virus-infected cells , pulse-chase and coim-munoprecipitation experiments were undertaken to examine the interactions between RelA and IxBa .
These experiments indicated that Sendai virus infection of PLB-985 cells induced de novo synthesis of IxBa , and the newly synthesized IxBa was chased into a complex that could be immunoprecipitated with either anti-RelA ( p65 ) or anti-IxBa antiserum .
In PLB-IIIB cells , anti-RelA ( p65 ) antiserum immunoprecipitated a RelA-IxBa complex , whereas no detectable RelA was coprecipitated with anti-IxBa antiserum .
These results suggest that in PLB-IIIB cells , two types of IxBa complexes may exist-one composed of RelA and IxBa and the other composed of IxBa without RelA ( possibly complexed to other induced cellular proteins ) .

INDUCTION OF NF- « B ACTIVITY BY VIRUS INFECTION 5243 Other studies have demonstrated the induction of NF- « B DNA binding activity in HIV-1-infected U937 cells ( 2 ) , via a mechanism involving increased transcription and processing of the p105 precursor ( 47 , 52 ) .
In THP-1 cells , HIV-1 infection resulted in two populations of chronically infected cells ( 50 ) .
Nuclear extracts from productively infected cells contained increased p50-RelA heterodimer binding activity , whereas extracts from cells expressing low levels of virus ( restricted expression ) displayed only p50 homodimer binding activity .
Increased NF- « B p50-RelA binding activity was also observed in HIV-1-infected peripheral blood monocytes and macrophages , suggesting that a certain level of myeloid maturation was required prior to NF- « B induction ( 64 ) .
The PRDII binding complex ( A ) identified in Sendai virus-infected cells and in HIV-l-infected PLB-IIIB cells was not completely shifted with the addition of p50 or RelA antibody or other antibodies , suggesting the presence of another , unrelated complex .
This complex appears to be composed of the 90- to 100-kDa proteins , which possess a high affinity for binding to AT-rich sequences , including the IFN-B PRDII domain .
Several experiments illustrate the lack of similarity between these proteins and previously characterized NF- « B subunits .
First , the 90- to 100-kDa proteins associated with either the P2 or the AT-rich probe were not inhibited by the addition of excess rIkBa .
Second , the formation of the 90- to 100-kDa protein complex with the P2 or the AT-rich probe was not blocked in the presence of several different NF- « B subunit-specific antisera .
Third , the virus-induced 90- to 100-kDa protein complex was trypsin resistant , whereas recombinant p50 or p50-RelA from cell extracts was trypsin sensitive .
The protein complex binding to the AT probe was also trypsin resistant .
On the basis of the unique sequence specificity of the 90- to 100-kDa protein complex , the inability of IxBa to block DNA binding , and the trypsin resistance of the complex , these proteins do not appear to be NF-KB related .
One possibility is that the 90- to 100-kDa proteins are related to other transcription factors that bind AT-rich sequences or to the chromosome-associated HMG I/Y proteins , which have been shown to interact with the PRDII domain ( 65 ) .
HMG I/Y proteins of approximately 15 kDa bind to the minor groove of PRDII and interact with the central AAATT sequence on the coding strand .
NF- « B binding to the major groove increased by 10- to 20-fold in the presence of HMG I/Y and resulted in a complex of retarded mobility that contributed to PRDII-dependent , virus-inducible expression of IFN-B ( 65 ) .
At present , we can not rule out the possibility that the 90- to 100-kDa proteins represent a complex between HMG I/Y and the RelA subunit .
The association of RelA with HMG I/Y may be highly stable and sufficient to alter the biochemical characteristics of the protein-DNA complex .
However , mixing experiments with recombinant RelA and HMG I and Y ( a kind gift from D. Thanos and T. Maniatis ) failed to generate complex A-like binding activity ( 54a ) .
Recently , Nakayama et al .
( 42 ) characterized a high-molecular-weight NF- « B-like binding activity that was constitutively present in lymphoid cells and that interacted with the IL-6 « B motif , which also has a central 5-bp AT-rich region .
Although the sequence specificity of IL-6 kB BFII was similar to that of the 90- to 100-kDa proteins described here , the BFII binding activity was partially inhibited by c-rel antisera ( 42 ) .
Similarly Lattion et al .
( 36 ) characterized a high-molecular-weight lymphoid cell-specific factor , NP-TCIHI , which bound to the simian virus 40 B site but was distinct from NF- « B on the basis of several criteria : lack of 5244 ROULSTON ET AL .
inhibition by IxBa , inability to be stimulated by deoxy-cholate treatment , distinct tryptic digestion products , and lack of reactivity to antisera against p50 , v-rel , or c-rel ( 36 ) .
The level of expression of this factor was high in pre-B and immature T cells and was thought to be involved in lymphocytic development ( 36 ) .
The biochemical identity of these proteins , as well as a comparison with the 90- to 100-kDa proteins , will require further analysis .
Distinct combinations of NF-KB binding proteins contribute to differential gene activation ( 5 , 28 , 33 , 35 , 48 , 68-70 ) .
In vitro transcription experiments demonstrated that NFKB1 ( p50 ) homodimers stimulated transcription from a template controlled by the immunoglobulin k element but not by the PRDII element , whereas RelA homodimers or NFKB1-RelA heterodimers stimulated in vitro transcription from both the immunoglobulin k and the PRDII templates by 10-fold .
Conformational differences may contribute to the degree of transcriptional activation by different subunit combinations ( 16 ) .
These results are consistent with those of cotransfection studies demonstrating that NF- « B heterodimer combinations are transcriptionally more potent than p50 homodimers ( 48 , 61 ) .
With regard to HIV-1 infection , an increase in transcriptionally active NF- « B DNA binding complexes in general and constitutive posttranslational induction of RelA in particular appears to provide an intranuclear environment that maintains a high level of HIV-1 LTR-mediated gene expres-sion .
Enhanced HIV-1 replication in myeloid cells may activate other NF- « B-regulated cytokine genes , including TNF , IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-6 , and GM-CSF ( 49 ) .
In addition to an autostimulatory effect on HIV-1 replication and NF- « B induction , cytokine induction may produce a range of pleio-tropic effects in the host , including inflammation , fever , and cachexia ( 54 ) .
The constitutive activation of specific members of the NF- « B/re/ family of transcription proteins may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection in myeloid cells .
