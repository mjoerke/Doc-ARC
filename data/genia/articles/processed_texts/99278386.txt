SLP-76 and Vav Function in Separate , but Overlapping Pathways to Augment Interleukin-2 Promoter Activity* ( Received for publication , February 12 , 1999 , and in revised form , March 27 , 1999 ) Nan Fangt # and Gary A. Koretzky $ §1 From the { Graduate Program in Immunology and the §Department of Internal Medicine , University of Iowa College of Medicine , Iowa City , Iowa 52242 SLP-76 and Vav , two hematopoietic cell specific molecules , are critical for T cell development and activation .
Following T cell antigen receptor stimulation , SLP-76 and Vav both undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and associate with each other via the SH2 domain of Vav and phosphorylated tyrosines of SLP-76 .
Furthermore , SLP-76 and Vav have a synergistic effect on interleukin ( IL ) -2 promoter activity in T cells .
In this report , we show that two tyrosines , Tyr-113 and Tyr-128 , of SLP-76 are required for its binding to Vav , both in vitro and in intact cells .
Surprisingly , we find also that the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav is not required for their cooperation in augmenting IL-2 promoter activity , as the two molecules appear to function in different signaling pathways upstream of IL-2 gene expression .
Overexpression of SLP-76 in the Jurkat T cell line potentiates the activities of both nuclear factor of activated T cells and AP-1 transcription factors .
In contrast , overexpression of Vav leads to enhanced nuclear factor of activated T cells activity without affecting AP-1 .
Additionally , overexpression of Vav , but not SLP-76 , augments CD28-induced IL-2 promoter activity .
These findings suggest that the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav in regulating IL-2 gene expression reflects the cooperation between different signaling pathways .
Recognition of specific antigen by the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) initiates biochemical changes including protein tyrosine phosphorylation , calcium influx , metabolism of phospho-lipids , and activation of the Ras/MAPK cascade ( 1 , 2 ) .
Together with signaling events initiated by engagement of co-receptors on the T cell , these biological second messengers lead to cytokine production , proliferation , and differentiation , or conversely programmed cell death ( 3-5 ) .
Activation of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) of the Sre and Syk families is the most membrane-proximal biochemical event known following TCR engagement ( 6 ) .
Phosphorylation of cellular proteins by these kinases is essential for all subsequent TCR-initiated signaling pathways .
PTK activation may result in downstream signals * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grant ROIGM53256 .

16206 through direct phosphorylation and modulation of the catalytic activities of effector molecules ( such as phospholipase C-y1 ) or the formation of signaling complexes by the interaction of proteins newly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues with other Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) or phosphotyrosine-binding domain-contain-ing proteins within the cell .
A widely studied example of this in T cells is the recruitment of ZAP-70 to the newly phosphorylated tyrosines of immune receptor activation motifs ( ITAMs ) on the TCR { and CD3 chains ( 7 , 8 ) .
Given the central importance of PTKs in T cell activation , a number of laboratories have attempted to identify substrates of these PTKs in an effort to gain insight into how biochemical signals are integrated .
Among the substrates identified are the hematopoietic cell-specific molecules SH2 domain containing leukocyte phosphoprotein of 76 kDa ( SLP-76 ) and Vav , both of which play critical roles in the regulation of TCR signals ( 9 , 10 ) .
SLP-76 is an adapter protein which is comprised of three motifs allowing for protein-protein interactions : an amino-terminal acidic region containing tyrosine phosphorylation sites ( 11 ) , a middle proline-rich motif that binds to the SH3 domain of Grb2 family members ( 9 , 12 ) , and a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain that associates with SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein of 130 kDa ( SLAP-130 or FYB , for Fyn-binding protein ) and another unidentified 62-kDa phosphoprotein ( 13-15 ) .
The importance of SLP-76 in T cell signaling has been demonstrated in experiments in the Jurkat human T cell leukemia line and in mice made deficient in SLP-76 expression through homologous re-combination .
When SLP-76 is overexpressed in Jurkat cells , there is a dramatic augmentation of TCR-mediated activation of the full-length IL-2 promoter or a reporter construct driven by the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) element from the IL-2 promoter ( 9 , 16 ) .
Each of the three structural domains of SLP-76 are essential for this enhanced promoter activity ( 17 ) .
Furthermore , TCR-mediated signals are abrogated in a mutant variant of Jurkat which has lost expression of SLP-76 ( 18 ) .
Studies of SLP-76-deficient mice indicate also that this adapter protein is critical for signaling via the pre-TCR , as these mice exhibit arrest of thymocyte development at the pro-T3 , CD3~ CD4~ CD8~ stage ( 19 , 20 ) .
Vav is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor which acts on members of the Rac/Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins ( 21 , 22 ) .
Vav has a pleckstrin homology , a Dbl homology , an SH2 , and two Sre homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains ( 23 , 24 ) .
The Dbl homology domain of Vav is responsible for its nucleotide exchange activity while the pleckstrin homology domain regulates interactions with inositol phospholipids ( 25 ) .
The SH2 and SH3 domains mediate the interaction of Vav with other signaling molecules , including SLP-76 ( 26-29 ) .
Like SLP-76 , Vav is critical for effective TCR signaling .
Its overexpression in Jurkat T cells also augments the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter following TCR ligation ( 10 ) .
T cells from Vav-deficient mice do not respond effectively to TCR stimulation This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; SLP-76 and Vav Function in Separate Signaling Pathways ( 30 , 31 ) .
Interestingly , overexpression of SLP-76 and Vav together has a synergistic effect on activation of the IL-2 promoter ( 29 ) .
However , previous studies have not addressed whether the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav is required for their synergy and if these two proteins function in the same signaling pathways .
In the experiments described in this report we investigated these questions first by identifying the tyrosines of SLP-76 responsible for the interaction with Vav both in vitro and in intact Jurkat cells .
Using this information , we performed a series of co-transfection assays and determined that the intermolecular interaction between SLP-76 and Vav is not required for their functional synergy .
This finding suggested the hypothesis that overexpression of SLP-76 versus Vav may impact distinct signaling pathways in T cells .
Experiments are presented demonstrating that these two molecules modulate distinct signaling cascades to link T cell surface receptors with IL-2 gene expression .

RESULTS Both Tyrosines 113 and 128 of SLP-76 Are Required for the SLP-76/Vav Interaction-The interaction between SLP-76 and Vav depends on the SH2 domain of Vav and tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 ( 28 , 29 ) .
Using a phosphopeptide library , Songyang et al .
( 34 ) found that the SH2 domain of Vav preferentially binds phosphorylated tyrosines in a Y*XXP motif ( where Y* represents a phosphorylated tyrosine , X is any amino acid , and P is a proline residue ) .
There are three tyrosines within SLP-76 which fall into such a motif : tyrosines 113 ( YESP ) , 128 ( YESP ) , and 145 ( YEPP ) .
Several lines of evidence suggest that Tyr-113 and Tyr-128 are good candidates for mediating the association between SLP-76 and Vav .
First , both Tyr-113 and Tyr-128 are substrates of the TCR-stimulated PTKs ( 11 ) .
Second , a similar YESP motif found in both ZAP-70 and Syk is known to be responsible for the interaction of these PTKs with Vav ( 85 , 36 ) .
Finally , phosphorylated pep-tides corresponding to the two YESP motifs of SLP-76 precipitate Vav from cell lysates and inhibit the SLP-76/Vayv interaction in vitro ( 28 , 37 ) .
To investigate further the importance of Tyr-113 , Tyr-128 , and Tyr-145 in mediating the interaction between full-length SLP-76 and Vav in intact T cells , FLAG-tagged SLP-76 constructs encoding wild-type SLP-76 ( WT ) or point mutants with tyrosines 113 , 128 , or 145 individually changed to phenylala-nine ( Y113F , Y128F , and Y145F ) were transfected into Jurkat T cells .
Transfected cells were stimulated via their TCR , lysed , and precipitated with anti-FLAG ( Fig .
14 ) or GST-Vav-SH2 fusion protein ( Fig .
1B ) .
Each construct was expressed at similar levels as revealed by immunoblot analysis for the FLAG epitope ( Fig .
1 , A , top panel ; B , left ) .
As shown previously , wild-type SLP-76 and each single tyrosine mutant is phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation ( Fig .
14 , bottom panel ) .
Surprisingly , however , mutation of either Tyr-113 or Tyr-128 abrogates the binding of SLP-76 to the SH2 domain of Vav ( Fig .
1B ) .
In contrast , wild-type SLP-76 and the Y145F mutant still bind to the Vav-SH2 ( Fig .
1B ) .
To obtain optimal phosphorylation of SLP-76 , we also stimulated cells with pervanadate , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor and found again that the Y113F and Y128F SLP-76 mutants fail to associate with the SH2 domain of Vav ( data not shown ) .
These in vitro findings were followed by experiments in intact Jurkat cells .
For these studies , cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged Vav and FLAG-tagged SLP-76 constructs .
Transfected Jurkat cells were treated with pervanadate , lysed , and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody .
As shown , an equal amount of Vav is present in each immune complex ( Fig .
1C , top panel ) .
However , both SLP-76 mutants Y113F and Y128F fail to co-immunoprecipitate with Myc-Vav , while wild-type SLP-76 and the Y145F mutant associate with Vav ( Fig .
1C , bottom panel ) .
Thus , in agreement with our in vitro finding , both tyrosines 113 and 128 of SLP-76 are required for the association of SLP-76 with the Vav SH2 in intact cells .
Synergy between Vav and SLP-76 Does Not Require Their Interaction-Although it is clear that SLP-76 and Vav syner-gize to couple TCR ligation with cytokine gene expression ( 29 ) , the mechanism for this cooperation is not clear .
One possibility is that SLP-76 , as an adaptor molecule , recruits Vav to the 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 16208 A IP : anti-FLAG [ I $ & « $ ® ﬁtﬁ 81 kDa -- an « - » an an Blot : anti-FLAG 81 kDa -- -.-_.- Blot : anti-PY B Lysate Vav SH2 PPT [ HT € ¢ $ x* P & [ s C « < < `` a* ¢ @ ﬁé ‘ p ‘ ﬁ 81 kDa -- an « - & ao & cam » 4- SLP-76 Blot : anti-F LAG C Lysates myc-IP I l I I & # & xP & « & C ~ $ 52.5 _C ﬁvbﬁ 104 KDa -- < -w- < -- -- -- @ ames que CP Vav Blot : anti-myc 81 KDa *- _ *- SLP-76 Blot : anti-F LAG Fic .

If this were true , the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav should require their interaction .
To test this possibility , we transfected cDNA encoding Vav along with SLP-76 mutants Y113F and Y128F and assessed the effect on IL-2-NFAT promoter activity .
To optimize conditions for observing synergy between SLP-76 and Vav , limiting amounts of cDNA encoding SLP-76 and Vav were transfected into cells .
As shown , overexpression of SLP-76 or Vav alone at this level fails to augment IL-2-NFAT promoter activity .
However , co-transfection of Vav with wild-type SLP-76 , or either SLP-76/Y113F or SLP-76/Y128F augments IL-2-NFAT promoter activity significantly ( Fig .
2 ) .
In each experiment , Western blot analysis demonstrated that all of the SLP-76 constructs were expressed at similar levels and that Vav was expressed similarly in each transfection condition ( not shown ) .

The synergy between SLP-76 and Vav does not require their interaction .
A luciferase reporter construct driven by three copies of the NFAT element of IL-2 promoter was transfected into Jurkat cells alone with control vector or cDNA encoding SLP-76 ( WT , Y113F , Y128F , and Y145F ) , Vav , or SLP-76 plus Vav .
24 h after transfection , cells were left untreated ( UN ; C ] ) or stimulated with anti-TCR mAb C305 ( TCR , ; ) or PMA plus ionomycin at 37 °C for 8 h. Lysates were prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity .
Results are shown as the percentage of the PMA plus ionomycin response ( maximum ) for each group .
Expression of SLP-76 constructs and Vav constructs were documented by Western analysis .
SLP-76 expression level is not changed with co-overexpression of Vav ( data not shown ) .
These data are representative of three independent experiments .
duced AP-1 Activity-Our observation that the association between SLP-76 and Vav is not required for their functional cooperation suggests the possibility that these two proteins modulate different TCR-induced signaling cascades .
We and others have found that when overexpressed individually , both SLP-76 and Vav augment activity of the NFAT region of the IL-2 promoter ( 9 , 10 ) .
Work from several laboratories has shown that this region of the IL-2 promoter includes two com-ponents ; a sequence which binds NFAT family members and a contiguous region which binds AP-1 dimers ( reviewed in Ref .
38 ) .
Thus , modulating signals leading to either NFAT translocation and activity or AP-1 function could increase responsiveness of an IL-2 promoter-derived NFAT reporter ( 39-41 ) .
We have shown that in the Jurkat T cell line , SLP-76 overexpression augments TCR-induced activation of a B-galactosid-ase reporter driven by 5 copies of an AP-1 response element ( 17 ) .
To test whether overexpression of Vav has a similar impact on AP-1 function , we transfected Jurkat cells with the AP-1 reporter construct along with either SLP-76 or Vav and measured -galactosidase activity in resting and stimulated cells .
As shown in Fig .
3 , TCR or PMA stimulation results in only a modest increase in AP-1 reporter activity in cells transfected with vector control .
TCR stimulation of cells transfected with SLP-76 cDNA results in marked augmentation of reporter activity .
As expected , SLP-76 overexpression does not impact on PMA-stimulated AP-1 function as SLP-76 is not tyrosine phosphorylated following PMA stimulation ( Fig .
3 and data not shown ) .
In contrast to results seen with SLP-76 , overexpression of Vav does not increase TCR stimulated AP-1 activity above that seen with the vector transfected control cells .
Thus it appears that although both SLP-76 and Vav can modulate some TCR signals , those leading to AP-1 activation are affected by SLP-76 but not Vav .
SLP-76 , but Not Vav , Leads to ERK Activation-There is considerable evidence to suggest that extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) family members stimulated by TCR ligation function upstream of AP-1 activation ( 40 , 42 , 43 ) .
We have found previously that overexpression of SLP-76 augments TCR induced activity of ERK2 ( 17 ) .

Overexpression of SLP-76 , but not Vav , augments AP-1 activity .
An AP-1-68-Gal reporter construct plus a Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase construct were transfected into Jurkat cells along with control vector , or cDNA encoding SLP-76 or Vav .
24 h after transfection , cells were left untreated ( UN ) or treated with anti-TCR mAb C805 ( TCR ) or PMA at 37 °C for 8 h. Cells were then lysed and B-Gal activity measured .
The B-Gal counts were normalized to the Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase counts to control for transfection efficiency .
Expression of transfected SLP-76 or Vav was documented by Western analysis with anti-FLAG ( for SLP-76 ) or anti-Myc ( for Vav ) antibody ( data not shown ) .
This experiment is representative of five independent experi- ments .

similar ability to modulate TCR-stimulated ERK function , a Myc-tagged ERK2 construct was co-transfected into Jurkat cells along with cDNA encoding SLP-76 or Vav .
Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated via the TCR or PMA .
Cellular lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc and in vitro kinase assays were performed on each immune complex using MBP as an artificial substrate .
Phosphorylation of MBP was quantitated by densitometry and normalized to PMA-induced MBP phosphorylation .
Whereas overexpression of SLP-76 consistently enhances TCR-induced kinase activity of ERK2 to a modest degree , overexpression of Vav does not affect ERK2 enzymatic activity ( data not shown ) .
We reasoned that if SLP-76 affects AP-1 indirectly via augmentation of ERK activity , overexpression of SLP-76 and ERK together should lead to additive enhancement of AP-1 activity in TCR- , but not PMA-stimulated cells .
Furthermore , since Vav does not appear to modulate TCR-stimulated ERK2 , we reasoned that overexpression of Vav plus ERK2 would not result in AP-1 function above that seen with overexpression of ERK2 alone .
We tested these hypotheses in the experiments shown in Fig .
4 .
For this study , the AP-1 reporter construct was transfected into Jurkat cells along with cDNAs for ERK2 alone or with either SLP-76 or Vav .
As predicted , overexpression of ERK2 , but not SLP-76 , impacts PMA-stimulated AP-1 activity ( Fig .
4A ) .
In contrast , overexpression of either SLP-76 or ERK2 augments TCR-induced AP-1 activity ( Fig .
44 ) .
Consistent with our hypothesis , overexpression of the two molecules together leads to further augmentation of AP-1 activity in TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells .
However , when we perform the same AP-1 reporter analysis in lysates from cells transfected with Vav , we find no augmentation of promoter activity above that seen with vector control transfectants .
Additionally , transfection with Vav plus ERK2 provides no greater AP-1 response than transfection with ERK2 alone ( Fig .
4B ) .
For each experiment , Western blot analysis was performed and showed expression of Myc-tagged ERK2 and Vav , or FLAG-tagged SLP-76 constructs ( data not shown ) .
Vav , but Not SLP-76 , Augments CD28-induced IL-2 Promoter Activity-Our experiments assessing the effect of SLP-76 or Vav on ERK and AP-1 indicate that SLP-76 modulates TCR-induced signaling pathways which are not affected by 16209 Vav .
We wondered , therefore , if the converse is true as well .
In T cells , signals initiated from the TCR cooperate with those arising from co-receptors , such as CD28 , to optimize IL-2 gene transcription ( 44 , 45 ) .
Work from a number of investigators has shown that the TCR and CD28 stimulate transactivation of different regions within the IL-2 promoter ( 46-48 ) .
A CD28-response element within the IL-2 promoter , CD28RE , has been defined which contains binding sites for Rel family members in conjunction with other transcription factors ( 48-50 ) .
In combination with TCR ligation or mitogenic stimulators such as PMA or phytohemagglutinin , engagement of CD28 induces these transcription factors to bind to and transactivate the CD2SRE ( 48 , 49 ) .
To investigate the potential roles of SLP-76 and Vav in CD28-stimulated IL-2 transcription , we performed reporter assays using either a full-length IL-2 promoter construct ( which includes the CD28RE ) or a reporter construct driven by four copies of the CD28RE .
The full-length IL-2 promoter construct was co-transfected into Jurkat T cells with cDNAs encoding either SLP-76 or Vav ( Fig .
5A ) .
Transfected cells were then left untreated or treated with TCR plus PMA or CD28 plus PMA .
As shown , although overexpression of either SLP-76 or Vav augments IL-2 promoter activity induced by stimulation via the TCR plus PMA , overexpression of Vav but not SLP-76 augments the CD28 plus PMA signal .
PMA by itself is not able to induce IL-2 promoter activity and overexpression of either Vav or SLP-76 does not affect its function ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it appears that Vav , but not SLP-76 , can mediate the signaling pathways linking CD28 to IL-2 gene expression .
Expression of transfected Vav or SLP-76 constructs were verified by Western blot ( data not shown ) .
To test more directly whether Vav can regulate CD28RE activation following CD28 ligation , we performed experiments with the CD28RE reporter ( Fig .
5B ) .
Jurkat cells were transfected with this reporter along with a vector control , SLP-76 , or Vav .
Cells were left untreated or were stimulated via their TCR or with anti-CD28 plus PMA .
Consistent with previous findings of others ( 48 , 50 ) , TCR stimulation or PMA by itself fails to induce CD28RE activity in vector control transfectants ( Fig .
5B ) .
Additionally , we find that overexpression of neither SLP-76 nor Vav modifies the ability of the TCR or PMA to induce this reporter .
Interestingly , however , transfection of Vav , but not SLP-76 , augments CD28/PMA-induced CD28RE activation , again supporting the notion that Vav and SLP-76 differ in their ability to impact on CD28-stimulated signaling pathways .
DISCUSSION Numerous signaling cascades function together to link antigen recognition to gene expression in T cells .
Recently , a number of studies have demonstrated the importance of adaptor molecules in regulating this network ( reviewed in Refs .
51-54 ) .
Having no intrinsic enzymatic activity , adaptor molecules recruit other signaling proteins to form multimeric complexes through intermolecular associations .
SLP-76 is one such adaptor protein which has been shown to bind Gads ( 12 ) , Vav ( 28 , 29 , 37 ) , SLAP-130 ( FYB ) ( 14 , 15 ) , and other as yet unidentified molecules .
Although these protein-protein interactions have been documented , their physiological importance remains un-clear .
Because SLP-76 and Vav function synergistically in their ability to augment TCR signaling leading to activation of the IL-2 gene ( 29 ) , we initiated a series of experiments to map the tyrosines of SLP-76 important for the SLP-76/Vav interaction and to ask about the functional consequences of their binding .
These experiments have led to a number of surprising findings .
We and others have shown previously that the association between SLP-76 and Vav is mediated by the Vav SH2 domain 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 16210 A Fig .

An AP-1-6-Gal reporter construct plus an Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase construct were transfected into Jurkat cells along with control vector or cDNA encoding SLP-76 , ERK2 , SLP-76 plus ERK2 ( A ) ; or Vav , ERK2 , Vav plus ERK2 ( B ) .
24 h later , cells were left untreated ( UN ) or treated with anti-TCR mAb C305 ( TCR ) B or PMA at 37 °C for 8 h. Cells were then lysed and B-Gal activity was measured .
The B-Gal counts were normalized to the Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase counts to control for transfection efficiency .
Western blot analysis was performed to verify the expression of transfected ERK2 , SLP-76 , and Vav ( data not shown ) .
The results shown in both panels A and B are representative of three independent experi- ments .

Relative Counts 25000 20000 15000 -I 10000 -I Relative Counts 5000 binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated residues within the SLP-76 amino terminus ( 28 , 29 , 37 ) .
In experiments presented in this study we found that although the binding is mediated by a single Vav SH2 domain , two SLP-76 tyrosines , Tyr-113 and Tyr-128 , both appear essential for this association .
This is particularly surprising since both Tyr-113 and Tyr-128 are found in identical sequence motifs ( DYESP ) , either of which would be predicted to bind the Vav SH2 .
Although we are not yet sure why both SLP-76 tyrosines are required for Vav bind-ing , several models come to mind .
One possibility is that tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 is sequential , and that phosphorylation of either tyrosine 113 or 128 is required for induced or maintained phosphorylation of the second residue .
Thus , although only one tyrosine may be involved in direct binding to Vav , the second tyrosine is required for the phosphorylation of the Vav-binding tyrosine .
However , while mutation of both tyrosines 113 and 128 abolishes TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 , mutants with either Tyr-113 or Tyr-128 mutated individually are still phosphorylated following TCR or pervanadate stimulation , making this explanation unlikely .
A second possibility is that one phosphorylated tyrosine is responsible for directing the interaction with the Vav SH2 domain , while the second tyrosine is required for stabilizing this interaction , perhaps through maintaining a structural micro-environment or via an interaction with a third molecule .
In this regard , SLP-76 was recently shown to simultaneously bind to the SH2 domains of Vav and the adapter protein , Neck , to form a trimolecular complex ( 55 ) .
Thus , it is possible that the SLP-76/Nck interaction is important for stabilizing the association between SLP-76 and Vav .
Crystal or solution nuclear magnetic resonance determination of the structures of SLP-76 , Vav , and Nck , when bound together , will be necessary to test this hypothesis .
On the surface , a second finding from our studies , that the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav does not appear to require their association , seems surprising .
One potential explanation SLP-76 and Vav Function in Separate Signaling Pathways 25000 AP-1 Activity g un TCR 20000 PMA H 15000 10000 5000 I 2 0 Vector SLP-76 ERK2 SLP-76+ERK2 cJ un TCR | Vav + ERK2 AP-1 Activity Vector Vav ERK2 could be that the SLP-76 tyrosine mutants dimerize with en-dogenous , wild-type SLP-76 and thus interact with Vav indi-rectly .
However , multiple experimental approaches in our laboratory have failed to demonstrate evidence for a SLP-76/ SLP-76 interaction , `` making this explanation unlikely .
Moreover , our result is consistent with several other observa-tions .
First , when SLP-76 mutants Y113F and Y128F are overexpressed at high levels , they augment IL-2-NFAT promoter activity to a level similar to that of wild-type SLP-76 ( 11 ) , suggesting that in this assay , SLP-76 can function independently of its ability to bind Vav .
Second , SLP-76 and Vav syn-ergize in augmenting basal IL-2-NFAT promoter activity in Jurkat cells , although under these conditions , SLP-76 is not phosphorylated and does not bind Vav ( 29 ) .
Third , it was reported that in the T cell hybridoma DC27.10 , where there is no detectable association between SLP-76 and Vav ( even following TCR stimulation ) , TCR ligation still induces IL-2 production ( 37 ) .
Finally , we have found recently that mice made deficient in SLP-76 expression by homologous recombination have a much more profound defect in T cell development than do mice which lack expression of Vav , suggesting that SLP-76 and Vav do not function entirely in the same pathway ( 19 , 20 , 30 , 31 , 56 ) .
Collectively , these observations , together with the experiments presented in our current study , suggest that the Vav/ SLP-76 interaction is not essential for their functional synergy , at least for inducing IL-2 gene transcription .
This conclusion led us to ask if SLP-76 and Vav may work together by modulating different signaling pathways in T cells .
There are several examples of how different pathways may enhance signals leading to IL-2 gene expression in T cells .
One involves the cooperation between signals initiated from the TCR and those stimulated by engagement of CD28 ( 47 ) .
Another is the interdependence of signals leading to translocation ° E. J. Peterson and G. A. Koretzky , unpublished data .

Vav , but not SLP-76 , regulates CD28-induced IL-2 transcription .
A , a luciferase reporter gene driven by the full-length IL-2 promoter was transfected into Jurkat cells along with control vector , SLP-76 , or Vav .
24 h after transfection , the transfected cells were left untreated ( UN ) or treated with anti-TCR mAb C305 plus PMA ( TCR + PMA ) , or anti-CD28 mAb A9.3 plus PMA ( CD28 + PMA ) , or PMA plus ionomycin at 37 °C for 8 h. Cells were then lysed and luciferase activity analyzed .
Results are shown as the percentage of the PMA plus ionomycin response ( maximum ) for each group .
Expression of transfected SLP-76 and Vav was documented by Western blot analysis ( not shown ) .
These data are representative of three independent experiments .
B , a luciferase reporter gene driven by CD28RE/AP-1 was transfected into Jurkat cells along with control vector , SLP-76 , or Vav .
24 h later , transfected cells were left untreated ( UN ) or treated with anti-TCR mAb C305 ( TCR ) , or anti-CD28 mAb 9.8A plus PMA ( CD28 + PMA ) at 37°C for 8 h. Cell lysates were prepared and luciferase activity was measured .
Results were calculated as extent of luciferase activity induced by TCR or CD28 treatment compared with unstimulated cells ( `` Fold Induction `` ) .

of NFAT from the cytoplasm to the nucleus with other signals leading to AP-1 activation resulting in stimulating promoter elements within many cytokine genes ( 38 ) .
Our studies suggest that the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav may reflect the cooperation of different , but overlapping signals initiated from the TCR and CD28 as Vav , but not SLP-76 impacts on the ability of CD28 to augment IL-2 gene promoter activity .
This finding is consistent with the observation that while Vav is one of the major substrates for CD28-induced PTKs ( 57 ) , we find that SLP-76 is phosphorylated to only a very limited extent , if at all following CD28 ligation ( data not shown ) .
Our data suggest also that SLP-76 and Vav function in different TCR-stimulated pathways as SLP-76 , but not Vav couples the TCR with AP-1 .
This is consistent with the recent observation that activation of ERK following TCR ligation is diminished markedly in SLP-76-deficient Jurkat cells ( 18 ) while stimulation of this second messenger is retained in Vav-deficient T cells ( 56 , 58 ) .
16211 Further insight into the potential mechanisms by which SLP-76 exerts its effects on TCR-mediated signaling have come from studies of the SLP-76 defective Jurkat mutant .
In this cell line , TCR engagement results in activation of PTKs , but fails to couple effectively with the phosphatidylinositol as well as Ras signaling pathways ( 18 ) .
Thus , it appears that SLP-76 , via its adaptor function , is critical for allowing TCR-stimulated PTK activation to result in optimal phosphorylation of phospholipase C yl in addition to signals leading to ERK activation .
It remains to be determined , however , exactly which protein-protein interactions mediated by SLP-76 are critical for these more downstream signals to occur .
Although the experiments in this study indicate that for TCR-stimulated IL-2 gene regulation , the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav does not appear to play a critical role , it is possible , and perhaps likely , that other T cell activation events are influenced by SLP-76 and Vav and require their interaction .
For example , it has been reported that the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav may be required for TCR-induced PAK activation as well as the capping process ( 55 ) .
Since several studies have shown that Vav plays a critical role in formation of the cap following TCR stimulation ( 56 , 58 , 59 ) , it will be important to study capping function in SLP-76-deficient T cells .
We are currently working to reconstitute our SLP-76-deficient mice with wild-type and mutant variants of SLP-76 to begin to address this and other related questions .
