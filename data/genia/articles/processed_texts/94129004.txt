Retinoic Acid Downmodulates Erythroid Differentiation and GA TALI Expression in Purified Adult-Progenitor Culture By C. Labbaye , M. Valtieri , U. Testa , A. Giampaolo , E. Meccia , P. Sterpetti , I. Paroltini , E. Pelosi , D. Buigarini , Y.E .
Cayre , and C. Peschle All-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) is an important morphogen in vertebrate development , a normal constituent in human adult blood and is also involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia .
We have examined the effects of RA on normal hematopoiesis by using early hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC ) stringently purified from adult peripheral blood .
In clonogenetic fetal calf serum-supplemented ( FCS* ) or -nonsupple-mented ( FCS ~ ) culture treated with saturating levels of in-terleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and erythropoietin ( Ep ) ( combined with c-kit ligand in FCS ~-culture conditions } , RA induces a dramatic dose-dependent shift from erythroid to granulomonocytic colony formation , the latter colonies being essentially represented by granulocytic clones .
This shift is apparently not caused by a recruitment phenomenon , because in FCS * culture , the total number of colonies is not significantly modified by RA addition .
In FCS~ liquid-suspension culture supplemented with saturating Ep level and LL-TRANS RETINOIC ACID ( RA ) and other synthetic analogues are important morphogens in avian/ mammalian development : ( 1 ) in chick embryonal limbs , endogenous RA gradients underlie pattern formation , and ( 2 ) in mouse embryos , perturbation of RA concentrations leads to disruptive morphologic alterations , as well as to ho-meotic transformations . ``
Furthermore , RA induces in vi-tro differentiation of human teratocarcinoma cells and coordinate expression of homeobox-containing genes .
!
RA also affects differentiation of neoplastic and normal hematopoietic cells .
In this regard , RA induces granulocytic differentiation of acute myeloblastic and promyelocytic leukemia ( AML , APL ) cell lines ( eg , HL-60 , NB4 , AML-193 ) * as well as APL blasts in vivo . ``
Studies on normal hematopoietic cells indicated that RA stimulates the clonal growth of normal human granulo-monocytic progenitors colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage [ CFU-GM ] , ' whereas the RA effect on erythroid progenitor growth was reportedly stimulatory in the human® and inhibitory in the avian ' species .
The significance of these different results on erythroid progenitors is uncertain , because the above-mentioned studies were performed not only on different species , but also with different RA dosages and on unpuri-fied bone marrow ( BM ) hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPCs ) ( the coplated accessory cells may modify RA me-tabolism , and release in culture a variety of growth factors . ``
'' Interestingly , RA is an important cofactor in T-lymphocyte proliferation , `` as well as in B-lymphocyte proliferation and/or differentiation .
'*'* We have analyzed the effects of RA on normal HPCs stringently purified from adult peripheral blood ( PB ) .
The results indicate that RA induces a dose-related inhibitory effect on the erythroid differentiation of early HPCs , possibly via suppression of GATA ] gene induction .

Studies on RA time-response or pulse treatment in semisolid or liquid culture show that early RA addition is most effective , thus indicating that early but not late HPC are sensitive to its action .
We then analyzed the expression of the master GATA !
gene , which encodes a finger transcription factor required for normal erythroid development ; addition of RA to HPC stimulated into unilineage erythropoietic differentiation in liquid culture caused a virtually complete inhibition of GATA !

These results indicate that RA directly inhibits the erythroid differentiation program at the level of early adult HPC , and may lead to a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway .

'
'' Cells were then incubated with immunomagnetic monodisperse microspheres coated with sheep antibody to mouse Ig ( Dynabeads M450 , Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) and separated with a magnet .
Clonogenetic assay .
- Purified HPCs were seeded ( 1 to 1.5 X 10 cells/mL/dish , two or three plates per point ) and cultured in 0.9 % methylcellulose , 40 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) in IMDM supplemented with a-thioglycerol ( 10~ ' mol/L ) ( Sigma ) , and different growth factors as detailed below ' > `` at 37°C in a 5 % CO ; /5 % O ; , / 90 % N ; , humidified atmosphere .
In nonsupplemented FCS ( FCS~ ) cultures , FCS was substituted by ' `` bovine serum albumin ( 10 mg/ mL ) , pure human transferrin ( 1 mg/mL ) , human low-density lipo-proteins ( 40 ug/ml ) , insulin ( 10 ug/mL ) , sodium pyruvate ( 10~* mol/L ) , L-glutamine ( 2 X 10 mol/L ) , rare inorganic elements ' supplemented with iron sulphate ( 4 x 10~® mol/L ) , and nucleosides ( 10 ug/mL of each ) .
Both FCS* and FCS~ cultures were supplemented with KL ( 10 ng/mL ) , IL-3 ( 100 U ) , GM-CSF ( 10 ng ) , and Ep ( 3 U ) .
RA ( Sigma ) was added either on day 0 only or every 2 to 3 days .
CFU-granulocyte , erythroid , monocyte , megakaryocyte ( GEMM ) , burst-forming unit erythroid ( BFU-E ) , and CFU-GM colonies were scored on day 14 or 16 through 18 in FCS* or FCS~ culture , respectively .
In selected experiments , colonies were picked up and the cell composition analyzed as described . ``
Liquid suspension culture .
- Step HIP HPs grown in FCS liquid culture ( 1 to 5 X 10° cells/mL in IMDM , supplemented as indicated above ) were induced to specific erythroid or granulocytic differentiation by appropriate th hematopoietic growth-factor combinations detailed below `` in a fully humidified 5 % CO ; /5 % 0 ; /90 % N ; atmosphere .
RA was added on day 0 and refed in fresh medium every 3 to 4 days .
Morphology analysis .
Cells were harvested at different days , smeared on glass slides by cytospin centrifugation , and stained with May-Griinwald Giemsa .
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis .
Total RNA , extracted by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/ CsCl method `` `` from the same number of cells in the presence of 12 ug of Escherichia coli tRNA , was quantitated by dot hybridization with a human rRNA probe . ``
After densitometric analysis , the normalized amount of RNA was reverse-transcribed ( Moloney murine leukemia virus RT , BRL ) with oligo ( dT ) as primer .
After 82 micro-globulin normalization , `` amplification within the linear range was achieved by 20 cycles of PCR consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 1.5 minutes , annealing at 52°C for 1.5 minutes , and extension at 72°C for 1.5 minutes .
Primers for GATAZ were 5-TTAGCCACC-TCATGCCTT-3 and S-ACATCGGTCTTAAGACCT-3* and generated a PCR product of 194 bp .
PCR was performed in a total volume of 100 LL , and 10 gL of each sample were electrophoresed in a 2 % agarose gel and transferred to a nylon filter for hybridization with an internal 40-mer GATA !
probe ( 5-TACTGTGGTGGC-TCCGCTCAGCTCATGAGGCACAGAG CA-3 `` ) .
In control experiments , serial dilutions of samples were amplified ; the dose-response curves showed linearity for all points .
Relative intensities of bands were quantified by scanning with a laser densitometer ( LKB ) .

precursors/terminal cells , data not shown ) : addition of peak RA dosage ( 107° mol/L ) causes a drastic decrease of the erythroid colonies , and an inverse rise of the granulocytic clones ( Fig 1 A and B ) .
In these studies , the total number of colonies is not significantly modified by RA addition .
The lack of change of total number , particularly in experiments with greater than 90 % purified HPs ( Fig 1B ) , indicates that the erythroid to granulocytic clonogenetic shift is not mediated by recruitment of HPCs .
A detailed analysis of these phenomena in FCS* or FCS~ clonogenetic purified HPC culture shows that the RA effect is dose-dependent ( Fig 2A ) .
The sensitivity of HPCs to RA treatment is more pronounced in FCS~ than FCS* culture conditions , ie , a marked effect is respectively observed at 107° and 10~° mol/L concentration .
The more pronounced sensitivity of HPCs to RA in FCS~ versus FCS* culture may be attributed to retinol-binding protein in serum . ``
In this regard , a 3 X 10~ concentration is monitored in normal human peripheral plasma , `` `` and a 10~® to 10~ ' concentration is present in chicken wingbud RA gradients . ``

RETINOIC ACID INHIBITION OF ERYTHROPOIESIS decreases as treatment is progressively delayed , down to absence of significant effects when RA is added at day 6 through 8 ( Fig 2B ) .
This indicates that the RA action takes place mainly at the level of early HPCs ( day 0 through 2 in culture ) , gradually decreases when RA is added onto intermediate HPCs ( day 4 through 6 of culture ) , and has no effect on late HPCs or early erythroid precursors ( day 8 of culture ) .

In the erythropoietic system , cell growth is markedly inhibited by RA , together with a drastic shift from the erythroid to granulocytic lineage , mainly of neutrophilic type ( Fig 3A ) .
Conversely , in the G-specific culture system , cell proliferation and differentiation are essentially unaffected by RA ( Fig 3B ) .
Finally , HPCs grown in the erythroid liquid-culture system were exposed to a `` pulse `` RA stimulus for 6 , 24 , or 96 hours .
The duration of RA treatment was directly related to the inhibitory effect on cell growth ( Fig 4A ) , as well as to the retardation of erythroid differentiation ( Fig 4B ) .
Interestingly a 6-hour pulse was sufficient to moderately affect both parameters .
In an attempt to define the molecular mechanism underlying the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation shift elicited by RA in HPC culture , we have analyzed GATA ] mRNA expression in HPCs differentiating in the unilineage erythroid or granulocytic liquid-suspension culture From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

system supplemented or not with RA ( Fig 5 ) .
In absence of RA we observed , in line with our previous studies , `` `` that ( 1 ) the GATA I gene is barely expressed in the initial population of quiescent HPCs ; ( 2 ) in the E differentiation pathway , GATALI expression is induced and then gradually enhanced through the initial stages of maturation ; and ( 3 ) differentiation along the granulocytic pathway is initially associated with induction of GAT AI expression , which is then downmodulated at the level of late progenitors/early differentiated precursors ( day 5 through 9 of culture ) ( Fig 5 ) .
RA addition to HPC differentiating in the erythroid culture system caused a drastic inhibition of GATAZL mRNA induction ; in contrast , addition of RA in the granulocytic differentiation culture did not modify the pattern of GATAL expression , except possibly for a moderate decline at day 5 ( Fig 5 ) .
Thus , in the first week of erythroid culture , RA treatment causes both a marked inhibitory effect on erythropoietic differentiation and a complete suppression of GATAL induction .
DISCUSSION All-trans RA is a high-affinity ligand of RA receptors `` * and a physiologic constituent in human blood . ``
'' Our studies indicate that RA induces a dose-dependent shift of highly purified adult HP from the erythrocytic to LABBAYE ET AL granulocytic differentiation pathway .
Similar results have been obtained with purified embryonic-fetal liver HPCs ( not shown here ) .
Interestingly , the biologic effects of RA are not shared by other members of the steroid- and thyroid-hormone ligand superfamily `` ® including thyroxine , gluco-corticoids , testosterone , B-estradiol , and progesterone ( U. Testa , C. Peschle , unpublished data , June 1993 ) .
The stringent purification of adult HPCs and the low number of cells seeded in clonogenetic culture render unlikely the possibility of an indirect RA effect via the coplated accessory cells ( eg , < 10 accessory cells/mL were present in the cultures shown in Fig 1B ) .
Furthermore , the RA effects have been confirmed in unicellular Step IIP purified HPCs ( results not shown ) .
The RA effect has been observed in both FCS* and FCS~ clonogenetic or liquid suspension cultures and in presence of different growth-factors stimuli inducing either multilineage ( erythropoietic and granulopoietic ) or unilineage ( erythrocytic or granulocytic ) differentiation .
It follows that the action exerted by RA directly on HPCs is independent from the culture conditions , including the type of erythropoietic growth-factor stimulus .
It is noteworthy that the RA action on adult HPC is time dependent , in that it gradually decreases when treatment is progressively delayed .
No effect is observed when RA is added on day 6 through 8 .

RETINOIC ACID INHIBITION OF ERYTHROPOIESIS is sufficient to induce a mild inhibition of erythroid proliferation and differentiation , whereas a 24- or 96-hour pulse treatment induces pronounced effects .
The results indicate that in these culture conditions , RA essentially acts at the early HPC level .
Altogether , the present observations may be compatible with those reported by Douer and Koeffler , ° who did not observe an inhibitory effect of RA on erythroid-progenitor colony formation ; indeed , these investigators utilized unpu-rified BM HPCs ( which comprise a majority of late erythroid progenitors and a minority of early ones ) supplemented with up to 10~ `` mol/L RA in FCS* culture .
It may be suggested that the action of RA on early HPs is mediated by modulation of the erythroid and/or granulocytic differentiation molecular program .
In this regard , the master gene GATA1I , encoding a 50-kD finger protein , regulates erythroid-expressed genes through core GATA motifs and is required for normal erythropoietic development , as shown by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells . ``
Whereas aspects of GATAI regulation in maturing erythroid cells are readily reconciled with its proposed role , `` `` we have analyzed its expression in the early stages of hematopoiesis , ie , in highly purified HPCs induced to gradual differentiation specifically along the erythrocytic or granulomonocytic pathway in FCS~ liquid-suspension culture . ``
'' As confirmed here , the GATA !
gene , though barely expressed in the early quiescent HPCs , is activated after entrance into the cell cycle upon growth-factor stimulus ; subsequently , increasing expression along the erythroid pathway contrasts with downregulation in the granulomonocytic lineage . ``
'' Hypo-thetically , on/off switches of lineage-restricted transactiva-tors may underlie the binary fate decisions of HPs . ``
The present results support the possibility that the erythrocytic to granulocytic shift induced by RA is mediated by suppression of GATAIT induction in the erythroid pathway , which may in turn lead to negative regulation of the Ep-receptor promoter . ``
It is noteworthy that both embryonic cells and adult HPCs are characterized by a striking proliferative and differentiative potential that may involve similar growth factors ( eg , KL , IL-3 , and IL-6 ) .
`` ° Similarly , RA may hypothetically function as both a morphogen in embryonic de-velopment , `` and a modulator in early adult hematopoiesis , as suggested by the present studies .
