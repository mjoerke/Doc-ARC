In addition , pretreatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal inhibits this ligand-induced degradation and , in agreement with previous studies , stabilizes a hyperphosphorylated form of the human IxBa protein .
By expressing mutant forms of the human protein in this cell line , we have been able to delineate the sequences responsible for both the ligand-induced phosphorylation and the degradation of IxBa .
Our results show that deletion of the C terminus of the IxBa molecule up to amino acid 279 abolishes constitutive but not ligand-inducible phosphorylation and inhibits ligand-inducible degradation .
Further analysis reveals that the inducible phosphorylation of IxBa maps to two serines in the N terminus of the protein ( residues 32 and 36 ) and that the mutation of either residue is sufficient to abolish ligand-induced degradation , whereas both residues must be mutated to abolish inducible phosphorylation of the protein .
We propose that treatment of 70Z % /3 cells with either phorbol myristate acetate or lipopolysac-charide induces a kinase activity which phosphorylates serines 32 and 36 and that these phosphorylations target the protein for rapid proteolytic degradation , possibly by the ubiquitin-268 proteasome pathway , thus allowing NF-B to translocate to the nucleus and to activate gene expression .
The Rel/NF- « B family of proteins ( p50 , p52 , p65/ReIA , c-Rel , and RelB ) bind specifically as homo- or heterodimers to kB motifs located in the promoters and enhancers of a large number of genes that control various aspects of the immune and inflammatory responses ( including the major histocompat-ibility complex class I genes , the immunoglobulin x light chain , interleukin 2 and its receptor , interleukins 6 and 8 , granulo-cyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , beta interferon , and T-cell receptor B chain ) as well as those of several viruses , including human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 and cytomegalovirus ( for recent reviews , see references 2 and 32 ) .
In most cell types , NF-kB is maintained in an inactive , cytoplasmic state in complexes with members of the IxB family , which includes IxBa , IBB , and IxBy ( only B cells and some cells of the monocyte or macrophage lineage exhibit constitutive nuclear NF-kB activity ) .
These inhibitors all contain multiple copies of a motif , the ankyrin repeat , which interact with and inhibit the nuclear localization and DNA binding of the proteins ( for a review , see reference 3 ) .
NF-kB is induced by a wide variety of stimuli ( including phorbol myristate acetate [ PMA ] , tumor necrosis factor , interleukin 1 , li-popolysaccharide [ LPS ] , viral infection , and many mitogens and cytokines ) through a mechanism involving inactivation of * Corresponding author .

5339 IxBa by proteolytic degradation , thus enabling free NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and to activate the transcription of its target genes ( 4 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 20 , 26 , 31 , 33 ) .
Pretreatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors has shown that IxBa becomes phosphorylated in response to a variety of stimuli , although this phosphorylation is not sufficient , per se , to dissociate the inhibitor from the NF-kB complex .
It is believed that this phosphorylated form of IxBa is the substrate for proteolytic degradation , which probably occurs in the context of the NF-xkB/IkxB complex ( 1 , 9 , 18 , 21 , 23 , 36 ) .
The domains of IxBa responsible for the interaction with Rel proteins as well as for inhibition of their binding to DNA have been well characterized ( see reference 10 and references therein ) .
To establish the domains of the IxBa protein responsible for degradation and to map the sites of ligand-induced phosphorylation , we have taken advantage of the fact that in mouse 702Z/3 cells , human IxBa expressed from a stably transfected construct is degraded in response to extracellular stimuli .
Pretreatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal ( ALLN ) blocks this induced degradation and stabilizes a hyperphosphorylated form of the transfected IxBa protein .
Mutagenesis of the human IxBa reveals that sequences C terminal of the ankyrin repeats contain sites of constitutive phosphorylation , while inducible hyperphos-phorylation takes place on serines 32 and 36 .
The phosphorylation of both of these residues is apparently required for the transfected IxBa protein to be degraded in response to extracellular stimuli such as PMA or LPS , a process which is dependent upon the C-terminal PEST sequences ( sequences rich in P , E , D , S , and T ) of IxBa .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
Hela cells were grown in Dulbecco minimal essential medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % newborn calf serum .
a murine pre-B cell line , was maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and 50 M B-mercaptocthanol .
Antisera .
The antisera used were the following ( see also references 26 and 27 ) .
Anti-c-Rel antisera were 1050 , raised against amino acids 438 to 455 of the murine protein , and 1051 , raised against amino acids 498 to 513 of murine c-Rel .
Anti-RelA antisera were 1207 ( ReIAN ) , raised against amino acids 2 to 18 of the human protein , and 1226 ( ReIAC ) , raised against amino acids 537 to 550 of human RelA .
Anti-IxBa « antisera were 1309 ( anti-IxBaN ) and 296 ( anti-IxBaC ) , raised against amino acids 2 to 17 and 310 to 317 of human IxBa « respectively .
Other antisera were 751 ( anti-murine IxBa ) , raised against amino acids 2 to 15 of murine IxBa ; 32 ( anti-rat IxBa ) , raised against amino acids 48 to 65 of rat IxBa ; and 48068 , raised against recombinant human IxBa « .
Serum 1309 recognizes human IxBa much better than it does mouse IxBa , and the reverse is true for serum 751 .
The S7 antiserum ( anti-IxBa ) , a gift of R. T. Hay ( St. Andrews , United Kingdom ) , was raised against recombinant human I « Be .
Plasmids .
Expression vectors for transfection into 70Z , /3 cells were obtained by subcloning cDNAs encoding IxB « or its derivatives into the plasmid pRe-CMV ( InVitrogen ) .
Some of the mutants were first cloned into the plasmid pT7Bplink ( 24 ) , and then the fragment containing the B-globin 5 ' untranslated region ( UTR ) and IxBa encoding sequences was recloned into pRe-CMV .
Deletions of IxBa were produced either by utilization of restriction sites or by digestion with Exolll .
Mutations of IxBa were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with PCR or with the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene Phagemid In Vitro Mutagenesis system , version 2 ( the sequence of the oligonucleotides is available from us upon re-quest ) .
Both types of fragment were cloned into either pRe-CMV or pCDNA3 ( InVitrogen ) .
All constructs were linearized with Bg/II before transfection by electroporation into 70Z/3 cells .
Cytoplasmic extracts .
To prepare crude cytoplasmic extracts , 5 X 10° cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 50 wl of Dignam buffer A supplemented with 5 mM NaF , 2.5 mM Na , VO , , 2.5 mM orthophosphate , and 0.2 % Nonidet P-40 .
After centrifugation for 2 min in a microcentrifuge , the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube for further analysis .
Protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) .
Transfections .
70Z/3 cells were grown to a density of 10° cells per ml , pelleted , and resuspended in complete medium at 5 X 10° cells per 0.5 ml , and then the cells were electroporated in 4-mm cuvettes with a Eurogentec Cellject eletropo-rator at 260 V , 1500 wF , and infinite resistance .
Cells were diluted into 4 ml of complete medium and were left to recover overnight before addition of 0.7 mg of G418 per ml .
Once established , clones were maintained in complete medium supplemented with 0.3 mg of G418 per ml .
Two-dimensional ( 2D ) gel electrophoresis .
Cytoplasmic extracts from 25 X 10° cells were prepared , and 600 ug of protein was made up to 30 pl of Dignam buffer A supplemented with 1 % B-mercaptocthanol and 0.3 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) .
Samples were boiled for 3 min and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen .
After lyophilization , samples were resuspended in 30 pl of sample buffer ( 9.95 M urea , 4 % Nonidet P-40 , 2 % ampholyte [ pH 5 to 7 ] , and 100 mM dithiothreitol ) and centrifuged for 2 min .
Samples were then loaded onto the isoelectrofocusing gel ( pH range , 4 to 8 ; Millipore Corporation ) and run for 20,000 V -h. The second dimension was performed as previously described on a 12.5 % acrylamide gel ( 15 ) .
Relative isoelectric points were determined by parallel migration of a carbamylated muscle creatine phosphokinase standard ( BDH ) , and the relative molecular masses of the proteins were determined according to molecular weight markers applied to an adjacent slot on the same gel .
After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) , proteins were blotted as they were for one-dimensional polyacrylamide gels .
Immunoblots .
Immunoblots were incubated with anti-IkBe sera diluted 1:1,000 , as indicated in the figure legends , and proteins were revealed with the Amersham ECL system .
Immunoprecipitations .
70Z/3 cells were metabolically labelled with either Jcysteine or *°P ; and were lysed , and immune complexes were precipitated as described in the figure legends .
Cells from the cell line 293 were metabolically labelled and immune complexes were precipitated as previously described ( 10 ) .
Thrombin treatment .
Thrombin treatment of immune complexes was carried out as described by MacKichan et al .
( 182 ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts of 70Z/3 clones , either untreated or stimulated with 10 mg of LPS per ml for 45 min in the presence of 100 M ALLN , were boiled for 5 min in 1 % SDS , and this was followed by immunoprecipitation with antiserum 296 directed against the C terminus of The protein A-Sepharose beads carrying the immune complexes were washed three times in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer without SDS and then were subjected to three washes in thrombin buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HC ] , pH 8.3 , 150 mM NaCl , 2.5 mM CaCl , , and 10 % glycerol ) .
After resuspension in 20 pl of thrombin buffer containing 3 U of thrombin , digestion was carried out for 2 to 16 h at room temperature .
All buffers contained phosphatase inhibitors .
After centrifugation , the supernatant was loaded on a 16.5 % Tricine gel ( 29 ) which was then transferred onto an Immobilon membrane ( Millipore ) .
The membrane was blotted with antiserum 1309 , directed against the N terminus of IB .

RESULTS A stably transfected IxBa protein is degraded in response to extracellular stimuli .
In order to identify the sequences of the IxBa protein responsible for its degradation in response to extracellular stimuli , we chose to utilize a system in which mouse 70Z/3 cells were stably transfected with plasmids expressing human IxBa protein .
Endogenous murine IxBa and the human IxBa could be distinguished by their different mobilities after SDS-PAGE ( compare the first two lanes of Fig .
1A ) .
The promoter chosen ( the cytomegalovirus promoter ) has a weak activity in 70Z/3 cells , and thus the levels of transfected protein do not differ greatly from those seen for the endogenous protein ( Fig .
1B ) .
A cell line expressing the wild-type ( WT ) human IxBa protein was treated with either PMA or LPS , and the two IxBa proteins were analyzed by Western blotting ( immunoblotting ) .
As can be seen in Fig .
1A , both the human and mouse IxBa proteins are degraded in response to these stimuli .
In addition , immunoprecipitation with anti-ReIA and anti-c-Rel antibodies demonstrates that the transfected IxBa is associated with the Rel proteins to an extent similar to that of the endogenous murine protein and that IxBa undergoes degradation with kinetics similar to those of the endogenous murine protein ( Fig .
1B ) .
Immunodepletions with a mixture of antisera directed against p50 , RelA , and c-Rel resulted Vou .

Cells transfected with the A268C mutant were prepared as described in the legend to Fig .
1A and then were incubated for 45 min in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of ALLN .
After incubation with 50 ng of PMA ( P ) per ml for 10 min or 10 jg of LPS ( L ) per ml for 45 min , cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and IxBa proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting .
The positions of the endogenous murine ( mu ) , transfected human A268C ( A ) , and electrophoretically retarded human A268C ( A* ) proteins are indicated .
The A* band sometimes appears as a doublet , but this result has not been found consistently .
in about 10 % of transfected WT IxBa being left in the supernatant ( compared with the total amount of IxBa left in the supernatant when a preimmune serum was used ; data not shown ) .
The result was the same for the endogenous murine IxBa , indicating that the levels of free IxBa are comparable for both transfected and endogenous proteins .
In accordance with results obtained by others ( 1 , 9 , 18 , 21 , 23 , 36 ) , we observed a stabilization of both murine and human proteins after pretreatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor ALLN ( Fig .
1A , lanes 5 and 7 compared with lanes 4 and 6 , respec-tively ) ; the murine protein is somehow less sensitive to the effect of ALLN , as previously observed by others ( see Fig .
2A of reference 6 ) .
Human IxBa also exhibits a characteristic upshift in its electrophoretic mobility , presumably resulting from the stabilization of a hyperphosphorylated form of the IxBa molecule after pretreatment with ALLN .
Under these conditions , no change in the electrophoretic mobility of the murine IxBa protein was seen ( Fig .
1A and data not shown ) , although this protein is normally degraded following stimula-tion .
In addition , 2D gel analysis shows a shift of the isoforms of the murine protein towards the acidic region following stimulation ( data not shown ) , thus confirming the fact that murine IxBa is also hyperphosphorylated under these conditions .
Treatment of resting cells with ALLN has no effect upon the mobility of either protein during SDS-PAGE ( Fig .
1A , compare lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Using this approach , we have stably transfected various mutant human IxBa constructs in order to localize the sequences in the human protein responsible for its inducible phosphorylation and degradation .
Deletion of IxBa PEST sequences abolishes degradation and constitutive , but not ligand-induced , phosphorylation .
The carboxy terminus of IxBa contains PEST sequences , which have been suggested to function as instability determinants for proteins degraded by the ubiquitin-268 proteasome pathway ( 25 ) .
Since IxBa degradation has been shown to be sensitive to inhibitors of proteasome activity , we first investigated whether this region of the protein was important for the inducible phosphorylation and degradation of the IxBa protein .
We constructed a series of C-terminal deletion mutants and stably transfected them into 70Z , /3 cells .
As shown in Fig .
2 , deletion up to and including amino acid 269 ( mutant A268C ) , which eliminates most of the PEST sequences , abolished the degradation of the transfected protein in response to PMA or LPS .
Similar results have been obtained in pulse REGULATION OF IxBa DEGRADATION 5341 chase experiments ( data not shown ) .
The truncated protein is still able to interact with NF- « B in vivo , as judged by its ability to retain cotransfected RelA in the cytoplasm of 293 or COS cells ( data not shown ) .
In extracts pretreated with ALLN before PMA or LPS stimulation , the transfected protein was subject to a retardation in mobility ( Fig .
2 , lanes 4 and 6 ) , indicating that it could still be inducibly phosphorylated in response to external signalling .
Longer exposure of the filter reveals that this upshifted band is also present when cells are induced in the absence of ALLN ( data not shown ) .
The mutation of Y-251 to an aspartic acid , or the mutation of S-252 , $ -262 , or T-263 to an alanine , did not affect either phosphorylation or degradation in response to induction with PMA or LPS ( data not shown ; these are phosphorylatable residues located between the end of the ankyrin repeats and amino acid 268 ) , indicating that phosphorylation sites lie elsewhere in the molecule .
The deletion of sequences up to and including amino acid 279 ( A278C ) also stabilizes the protein against ligand-induced degradation , while a protein deleted up to amino acid 291 ( A290C ) behaves as the WT protein ( data not shown ) , indicating that amino acids 279 to 290 play an important role in induced degradation of IxBa .
While both human and murine full-length proteins exist as multiple isoforms in uninduced cells as revealed by multiple spots following 2D gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting ( Fig .
3A ) , deletion of the C terminus of IxBa ( mutant A268C ) results in the appearance of a single spot ( Fig .
3B ) , indicating that the C-terminal PEST sequences are variably phosphorylated in uninduced cells .
To more directly demonstrate that constitutive phosphorylation takes place in the PEST region of the molecule , we carried out immunoprecipitation on °°P ; -labelled cells transfected either with the WT human IxBa or with the mutant A268C .
The results shown in Fig .
4 demonstrate that WT human IxBa is already phosphorylated in unstimulated cells ( Fig .
4B , lane 3 ) and that treatment with LPS in the presence of ALLN results in the appearance of an additional band with reduced mobility ( lane 4 ) ( °°P labelling results in a poor resolution of the two bands , as opposed to the results obtained by ECL on Western blots ) ; on the other hand , a very faint band can be detected in the case of the A268C mutant in unstimulated cells ( lane 1 ; clearly visible on a longer exposure ) , while LPS treatment results in the appearance of an electrophoretically retarded labelled band .
Western blotting of controls of these extracts shows the presence of the WT and A268C proteins in unstimulated cells as well as the upshifting in the presence of LPS and ALLN ( Fig .
4A ) .
These results demonstrate that almost all basal phosphorylation takes place between amino acids 269 and 317 and that inducible phosphorylation takes place in the remaining part of the molecule .
Since the mutations of serine and threonine residues to alanines in the PEST region have only slight effects upon the ability of IxBa to inhibit DNA binding of NF- « B ( 10 ) and have no effect upon the degradation of IxBa in response to stimulation ( data not shown ) , the function of these constitutive phosphorylations of IxBa remains , for the moment , unclear ( see Discussion ) .
Phosphorylation of both serines 32 and 36 is required for ligand-induced degradation of transfected IxBa .
As deletion of the C-terminal region of IxBa had no effect upon its ability to be phosphorylated in response to extracellular stimuli , we next investigated phosphorylatable residues in the N terminus of the molecule .
Deletion of the first 30 amino acids of IxBa ( A30N ) destabilized the protein to such an extent that it was not visible by either Western blotting or immunoprecipitation of [ ~S ] methionine-labelled extracts from cells stably transfected with this construct ( data not shown ) .

terminus of the molecule contains two highly conserved serine or threonine residues ( within the IxBa or IxBB family ) .
We therefore decided to mutate these residues and to analyze the behavior of the mutant proteins in response to PMA and LPS when stably expressed in 70Z/3 cells ( residue 62 , which in the human protein is also a serine , is not conserved in murine IxBa and therefore has not been investigated further ; mutation of threonine at position 71 to an alanine results in a molecule with a greatly reduced affinity for the Rel proteins and a very short half-life , thus precluding its analysis ) .
The mutation of either serine 32 ( Fig .
5B and D ) or serine 36 ( Fig .
5C ) to an alanine abolished the degradation of the transfected protein following stimulation with PMA or LPS .
Since the mutation of serine 36 to alanine resulted in a protein ( S36A ) with an altered electrophoretic migration , we also tested a mutant in which serine 36 was changed to a proline .
This protein was also not degraded in response to PMA ( Fig .
5B ) or LPS ( Fig .
5D ) .
These two mutant proteins also undergo electrophoretic retardation during SDS-PAGE when extracts are prepared from cells treated with LPS , even in the absence of ALLN ( Fig .

The extents of retardation for the mutant proteins were somewhat less than that of the WT protein , but this could be due to Mor .

70Z/3 cells transfected with WT human IxBa or with the A268C mutant were starved for 1 h in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 3 % dialyzed calf serum and then were labelled for 3 h with 0.5 mCi of *°P ; per ml in the presence of 100 wM ALLN .
Half of the cells were stimulated for 45 min with LPS ( 10 pg/ml ; lanes 2 and 4 ) at the end of the labelling period , while the other half were left untreated ( lanes 1 and 3 ) .

differences in conformation .
These results suggest that the mutant proteins can be partially phosphorylated in response to stimulation but that phosphorylation at both serine 32 and serine 36 is required for the protein to be degraded ( see Discussion ) .
Finally , we constructed a mutant which encodes a protein in which both serines 32 and 36 are changed to ala-nines .
This protein , when stably transfected into 70Z/3 cells , was also not degraded in response to LPS ( Fig .
5E ) or PMA ( data not shown ) .
In addition , this protein did not undergo any change in electrophoretic mobility when cells were treated with ALLN ( Fig .
5E , last lane ) , indicating a complete absence of ligand-induced phosphorylation .
The amount of transfected human IxBa was somehow variable depending on the mutant considered .
We wondered whether this was an indication of a different stability of these mutants in unstimulated cells .
Therefore , we measured the half-lives of these molecules by pulse-chase experiments in untreated cells and found that the half-lives of WT human and endogenous murine IxBa were about 45 min , while that of mutant $ 36A was more than 60 min ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , the amount of a given mutant protein in a given transfection is not a reflection of its half-life but is more likely to be random , as observed from the analysis of several transformation experiments ( not shown ) .
In order to obtain more-direct evidence that phosphorylation takes place on these serines , we took advantage of our observation that thrombin cleaves human IxBa after amino acid 61 ( at the sequence PRGS ; see also reference 12 ) , giving rise to an N-terminal fragment containing only two phosphorylatable residues , serines 32 and 36 ( there is also a Y at position 42 , but immunoblotting analysis with anti-phosphoty-rosine antiserum indicated that IxBa is not phosphorylated on tyrosines following treatment with PMA or LPS ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts of 70Z/3 clones , either untreated or stimulated with LPS in the presence of ALLN , were immunoprecipitated first with an antiserum raised against the C terminus of human IxBa .
Digestion with thrombin was carried out on the protein A-Sepharose beads , therefore releasing the N-terminal 61 amino acids of this molecule into the supernatant .
This supernatant was run on a Tricine gel ( allowing resolution of small peptides ) , which was then transferred to Immobilon mem- Vou .

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 0.1 % SDS , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.05 % sodium deoxycholate ) , and after centrifugation for 2 min in a microcentrifuge , supernatants were transferred to new tubes .
SDS was added to a final concentration of 2 % , and samples were boiled before dilution in RIPA buffer .
After preclearing overnight with a preimmune serum , IxBa proteins were precipitated with anti-IxBaN ( 1309 ) , anti-IxBaC ( 296 ) , and anti-rat IxBa ( 32 ) antisera and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
Extracts were prepared from cells expressing the following : WT , human IxBa WT protein ; 702/3 , 70Z/3 cells transformed with the Re-CMV vector alone ; 32A , human IxBa protein containing the mutation serine 32 to alanine ; 36P , human IxB « protein containing the mutation serine 36 to proline .
( C ) 70Z/3 cells expressing WT IxBa protein or the mutant protein carrying the mutation serine 36 to alanine ( 36A ) were treated with 20 pg of cycloheximide per ml ( - ) or 20 ug of cycloheximide per ml plus 20 pg of LPS per ml ( + ) or were left untreated ( 0 ) for 1 h. The cells were pelleted , lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer , boiled , and loaded onto duplicate gels .
After blotting , filters were probed with anti-human IxBa « antiserum ( 1309 ; left panel ) , to detect only the transfected molecule , or anti-murine antiserum ( 751 ; right panel ) , to detect the endogenous murine molecule .
( D ) Cells expressing WT or mutant ( 32A or 36P ) human IxBa proteins were grown to a density of 10° cells per ml and then were pelleted , resuspended at 5 X 10° cells per ml , and incubated for 45 min in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of the proteasome inhibitor ALLN ( 100 M ) .
Cells were then treated with 10 pg of LPS ( L ) per ml for 45 min or left untreated ( 0 ) , and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting with the S7 anti-IxBa antiserum .

Cytoplasmic extracts of 70Z/3 clones transfected with either WT human IxBa or with mutants S36P or $ 32A,836A , either untreated ( - ) or stimulated with 10 jg of LPS for 45 min in the presence of 100 M ALLN ( + ) as indicated , were boiled for 5 min in 1 % SDS and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with antiserum 296 , directed against the C terminus of IxBa , in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors .
The immunoprecipitate was digested with thrombin as described in Materials and Methods , and the released N-terminal 61-amino-acid peptide was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 16.5 % Tricine gel followed by immunoblotting with antiserum 1309 , raised against the N terminus of human IxBe .
In lane 3 , the peptide was treated with alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) before analysis on the Tricine gel .
Molecular mass markers ( in kilodaltons ) are on the right .
results in the disappearance of the upshifted band ( lane 3 ) , indicating that it is due to phosphorylation .
These results demonstrate that induced phosphorylation takes place in the first 61 amino acids of the molecule , that is , on serine 32 or 36 or both ( see Discussion ) .
To verify that the stabilities of these mutants were not the result of a loss of ability to bind to Rel-family proteins , we tested their abilities to interact with either c-Rel ( Fig .
7 ) or RelA ( data not shown ) .
Mutation of either serine 32 or 36 did not affect the affinity of the mutant proteins for c-Rel .
The double mutant of serines 32 and 36 to alanines bound both c-Rel and RelA , with affinities comparable to that of the WT protein ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION Activation of NF- « B in vivo is dependent upon the proteolytic degradation of the inhibitor IxBa following stimulation , a process thought to take place in the context of the NF- « B/IxB complex following the phosphorylation of the IxBa molecule ( 1 , 9 , 18 , 21 , 23 , 36 ) .
Here we demonstrate that the degradation of IxBa in response to extracellular stimulation is dependent upon the presence of an intact C terminus as well as the phosphorylation of serines 32 and 36 .
These results are in broad agreement with recently published data ( 6 ) , with one important difference : in our cell line it is necessary to mutate both serines 32 and 36 to abolish ligand-inducible phosphorylation , whereas according to the published data , mutation of one serine or the other was sufficient .
The reason for this discrepancy is not clear .
More recently , two reports demon 5344 WHITESIDE ET AL .

Lysates from 293 cells transfected either with WT human IxBa or with human IxBa containing the mutation Ser-32 to Ala ( Ser-32-Ala ) ( 32A ) , Ser-36-Pro ( 36P ) , Ser-36-Ala ( 36A ) , or Ser-62-Ala ( 62A ) or cells transfected with vector alone ( Mock ) were mixed with lysates from cells transfected with c-Rel and were metabolically labelled with 1.- [ *°S ) methionine-.- [ *S Jcysteine and precipitated with anti-IxBaN antiserum ( 1309 ) .
As a positive control , a sample of the labelled lysate was precipitated with anti-c-Rel ( Rel ) .
Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE ; the presence of a band comigrating with that of the positive control indicates the ability of a given mutant of IxBa to interact with c-Rel .
strated the importance of serines 32 and 36 for the induced degradation of the IxBa molecule ( 5 , 35 ) .
However , neither of these reports directly demonstrates that phosphorylation takes place on these two serines .
One question that remains unanswered is whether in vivo phosphorylation takes place on both serines or on one of them only .
The fact that the mutation of only one serine abolishes degradation but not phosphorylation on the other serine would tend to suggest that phosphorylation on both serines is required ; however , direct sequencing or mass spectrometry analysis of the phosphorylated peptide isolated from stimulated cells will be necessary to answer this question .
The C terminus of IxBa is rich in the amino acids P , E , D , S , and T , and such PEST sequences have been correlated with high rates of protein turnover ( 25 ) .
Our studies have shown that the sequences between amino acids 279 and 290 are critical for degradation of IxBa in response to extracellular stimuli , results that are in accordance with a recently published paper ( 28 ) .
This region of the molecule contains 75 % ( 9 of 12 ) PEST residues , indicating an important role for such sequences in the degradation of IxBa .
2D gel electrophoresis and °°P labelling analyses comparing the WT molecule with a mutant lacking the PEST domain suggest that this C-terminal region is multiply and variably phosphorylated in unstimulated cells .
One alternative interpretation of our results , although less likely , is that the deletion of the C-terminal region in the A268C mutant removes regulatory determinants that mediate distal phosphorylation events .
Since the mutation of serines and threonines in this region has no effect upon protein stability following induction , the role of these phosphorylations remains unclear .
It may be that the C terminus acts to correctly position the IxBa molecule upon the NF-kB complex so that it can be recognized by the degradation machinery following phosphorylation upon serines 32 and 36 .
We propose that the IxBa molecule is phosphorylated by a kinase ( or kinases ) which phosphorylates residues 32 and 36 .
Upon treatment of cells with inducers of NF-kB , this activity is upregulated and the increased phosphorylation of IxBa targets the protein for rapid degradation .
This activation could result from a direct increase in kinase activity , or alternatively , it could be that the kinase activity is constitutive and that in uninduced cells there exists a highly active phosphatase which removes the phosphate groups from serines 32 and 36 .
Upon induction , the activity of the phosphatase would be sharply downregulated , resulting in the appearance of a hyperphos- Mor .

phorylated form of IxBa which is then degraded .
Such a hypothesis might explain how NF-B is activated by treatment of cells with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid ( see reference 36 and references therein ) .
Analysis of the N-terminal sequences for known kinase sites reveals that serines at positions 32 and 36 each lie within a consensus casein kinase II ( CKII ) site .
It must also be noted that these residues do not form a site for the double-stranded RNA-induced kinase protein kinase R ( PKR ) , an enzyme which has been suggested to be required for NF-kB activation by double-stranded RNA and viruses ( 14 ) .
It is interesting to note that IxBB , the second major isoform of IxB found in cells , also contains two serines ( or one serine and one threonine for the human molecule ) separated by 3 amino acids ( Fig .
5A ) whose sequence context resembles that of serines 32 and 36 of the a isoform ( 16 , 34 ) .
However , while IxBB is degraded in response to LPS , it does not respond to PMA .
Whether these residues are required for the phosphorylation and degradation of IxBB , and whether the same activity is responsible for the phosphorylation of both molecules , remains to be established .
The control of protein degradation by means of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation has been previously described , although in most cases the sequences responsible have not been elucidated .
Phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 ( MAP-2 ) by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibits calpain-induced hydrolysis of MAP-2 ( 13 ) .
The stabilities of the two yeast cyclin inhibitor proteins Farl and Sic1 also appear to be regulated by phosphorylation ( 19 ) .
Sicl is degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner , possibly as a result of phosphorylation ( for a discussion , see reference 30 ) .
The manner by which the phosphorylation of IxBa targets the molecule for degradation is unclear .
It is intriguing that both N- and C-terminal domains play roles .
In the case of the recombination activator protein RAG-2 , the sequences responsible for phosphorylation and degradation are found in the C-terminal 90 amino acids , which encode a threonine ( T-490 ) as well as a lysine-rich region ( 17 ) .
Instability is determined by phosphorylation of threonine 490 .
Degradation of the c-Mos proto-oncogene product in activated Xenopus eggs requires ubiquitination of lysine residue 34 , which is dependent upon the dephosphorylation of a serine residue at position 3 ( 22 ) .
How phosphorylation and dephosphorylation act to induce ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in these two cases is not known .
The recent findings that p105 , the precursor protein for the 50-kDa subunit of NF-kB , requires the ubiquitin-268 proteasome pathway for its maturation and that inhibitors of p105 maturation also inhibit the degradation of IxBa suggest that IxBa is also degraded by this pathway ( 23 ) .
More recent data show that phosphorylated IxBa is a substrate for ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic degradation ( 1a ) .
We note the presence of lysine residues at positions 21 , 22 , and 38 , which could serve as sites for ubiquitin binding .
We are currently testing the functions of these lysines .
