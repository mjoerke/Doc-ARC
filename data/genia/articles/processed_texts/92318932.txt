All tumor cell lines from the B-cell lineage and a few from the T-cell lineage express Oct-2 .
To address the role of Oct-2 in the T-cell lineage , we studied the expression of Oct-2 mRNA and protein in nontransformed human and mouse T cells .
Oct-2 was found in CD4* and CD8* T cells prepared from human peripheral blood and in mouse lymph node T cells .
In a T-cell clone specific for pigeon cytochrome c in the context of I-E* , Oct-2 was induced by antigen stimulation , with the increase in Oct-2 protein seen first at 3 h after activation and continuing for at least 24 h. Oct-2 mRNA induction during antigen-driven T-cell activation was blocked by cyclosporin A , as well as by protein synthesis inhibitors .
These results suggest that Oct-2 participates in transcriptional regulation during T-cell activation .
The relatively delayed kinetics of Oct-2 induction suggests that Oct-2 mediates the changes in gene expression which occur many hours or days following antigen stimulation of T lymphocytes .
The octamer DNA motif ( ATTTGCAT or close variants ) is emerging as an important transcriptional regulatory motif in T-cell activation .
Within the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter , an octamer motif is present in a 30-bp region , termed NF-IL-2A , that is critical for promoter activity during activation of the Jurkat T-cell line ( 6 , 13 , 23 ) .
Activation of Jurkat cells generates a DNase-hypersensitive site in the NF-IL-2A region , suggesting that transcription factors bind to this sequence in an inducible fashion ( 24 ) .
The NF-IL-2A region , when multimerized , functions as an inducible transcriptional enhancer that responds to signals delivered by cross-linking the T-cell antigen receptor , and this enhancer activity depends on the octamer motif ( 2 , 4 , 15 , 31 ) .
The immunosuppressive agents cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 inhibit the transcription of a host of genes which are normally induced during T-cell activation , and both agents block the activity of the NF-IL-2A sequence ( 2 , 4 , 15 , 31 ) .
Transcription factors which bind specifically to the octamer motif belong to the POU domain multigene family ( 12 ) .
One member of this family , Oct-1 , is expressed in most cell types and is the only octamer-binding protein which is detectable in Jurkat T cells ( 2 , 13 , 14 , 23 , 25 , 31 ) .
However , Oct-1 levels do not change during activation of Jurkat cells ( 2 , 23 , 31 ) .
It has been shown that an inducible protein interacts with Oct-1 and accounts for the inducibility of the NF-IL-2A sequence in this T-cell tumor line ( 13 , 30 , 31 ) .
Another octamer-specific POU domain protein , Oct-2 , is expressed predominantly , but not exclusively , in the B-cell lineage , where it has been implicated in the transcriptional control of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes ( 26 ) .
However , Oct-2 is also expressed in some , but not all , T-cell tumor lines ( 5 , 22 , 25 ) .
The ELA T-lymphoma cell line expresses high levels of Oct-2 , whereas Jurkat cells do not express detectable Oct-2 ( 25 ) .
Interestingly , transfection of Jurkat cells with an Oct-2 expression construct cooperates with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) to induce IL-2 gene expression and substitutes * Corresponding author .
3149 for the phytohemagglutinin signal ( 13 ) .
These studies raise the interesting possibility that Oct-2 has a role in gene expression during T-cell activation .
We therefore investigated the expression of Oct-2 in nontransformed T cells and demonstrate here that Oct-2 is induced in T cells in response to a cognate antigen .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
A.E7 is a nontransformed Tpl T-cell clone derived from a B10.A mouse immunized with pigeon cytochrome c ( 11 ) .
A.E7 cells are responsive to pigeon cytochrome c , cyanogen bromide fragment 81-104 , in the context of I-E* .
A.E7 produces IL-2 , gamma interferon , tumor necrosis factor alpha , lymphotoxin , granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and IL-3 upon antigenic stimulation and was maintained essentially as previously described ( 11 ) .
Briefly , cells were stimulated for 2 days in 24-well tissue culture plates ( Costar , Cambridge , Mass . )
at a concentration of 10° A.E7 cells per well and 5 x 10° B10.A irradiated ( 3,000 rads ) spleen cells per well in 2 ml of A.E7 medium ( EHAA medium [ Biofluids , Rockville , Md . ]
supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum [ Biofluids ] , 2 mM glutamine , 100 mg of streptomycin per ml , 100 U of penicillin per ml , and 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol ) .
The cells were then expanded into 200-cm > flasks ( Nunc , Roskilde , Denmark ) in A.E7 medium supplemented with 1 % conditioned supernatant from the MLA-144 cell line , which provides approximately 15 U of IL-2 per ml .
The cells were then allowed to rest for 14 to 21 days before use .
DCEK is a transfected fibroblast line which expresses I-E `` and can present antigen to A.E7 cells ( kindly provided by Ron Germain , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Md . )
.
DCEK cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium ( Biofluids ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Biofluids ) , 2 mM glutamine , 100 mg of streptomycin per ml , 100 U of penicillin per ml , and 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol .
Human CD4* T cells and CD8* T cells ( a gift of Ivan Horak , Metabolism Branch , National Cancer Institute , Be 3150 KANG ET AL .
thesda , Md . )
were prepared from peripheral blood as previously described ( 29 ) .
Mouse T cells ( a gift of Toshio Tanaka , Laboratory of Immunology , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , Bethesda , Md . )
were prepared from mesenteric lymph nodes as previously described ( 28 ) .
Both cell populations consisted of > 99 % T cells as determined by staining with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies ( human T cells ) or a mixture of anti-Thy1.2 , anti-CD3 , anti-CD4 , and anti-CD8 antibodies ( mouse T cells ) followed by flow cytom-etry on a FACScan ( Becton Dickinson & Co. , Mountain View , Calif. ) .
Cell stimulation .
To selectively assay changes in Oct-2 expression in A.E7 T cells from cultures containing DCEK antigen-producing cells ( APC 's ) , a method of removing APCs was developed ( 13a ) .
Briefly , DCEK cells were loaded with magnetic beads ( Dynal , Great Neck , N.Y. ) , isolated by using a magnet ( Advanced Magnetics Inc. , Cambridge , Mass . )
, and irradiated with 3,000 rads .
A.E7 cells ( 50 x 10° ) were then incubated with 25 x 10° bead-loaded DCEK cells and 10 uM pigeon cytochrome c ( CNBr fragment 81-104 ) in 20 ml of A.E7 medium in an upright 80-cm flask ( Nunc ) .
The cells were harvested , pipetted vigorously to obtain a single-cell suspension , and fractionated by using a magnet which yielded a cell population that consisted of > 99 % A.E7 cells .
Treatment with ionomycin ( 2 M ) and/or PMA ( 20 ng/ml ) was done in the same manner as the antigen treatments , except that no DCEK cells were used .
CsA ( a gift of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals ) was used at 200 ng/ml .
Treatment with anisomycin ( 10 mM ) was begun 30 min prior to antigen stimulation .
EMSA .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were performed as previously described ( 27 ) , by using 2 pug of nuclear extract ( 16 ) or whole-cell extract ( 19 ) prepared as previously described .
The radiolabelled oligonucleotide probes used were derived from an Igx promoter , either wild type or mutated in all base pairs of the octamer motif ( 19 ) , or the mouse IL-2 promoter NF-IL-2A region with the following sequence : 5'TCGAGAAAATATGTGTAATATGTAAAACATCGT3 ' 3'CTTTTATACACATTATACATTTTGTAGCAAGCTS ' Rabbit anti-Oct-2 serum was prepared by immunizing rabbits with the peptide EAEKQGLDSPSEHTDTERN ( de-rived from the amino terminus of human Oct-2 , outside of the POU domain ) coupled to thyroglobulin .
One microliter of undiluted antiserum was premixed with extract and incubated at 4°C for 30 min .
The remaining components of the binding reaction were then added , and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min prior to loading on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide ge !
as previously described ( 27 ) .
RNA analysis .
Total RNA was prepared by using RNAzo !
( Cinna/Biotexc , Friendswood , Tex . )
in accordance with the manufacturer 's protocols and analyzed on Northern ( RNA ) blots ( 20 ) or by RNase protection assay ( 1 ) as previously described .
Northern blots were hybridized with mouse actin cDNA probes radiolabelled by the random-hexanucleotide priming method ( 1 ) .
The plasmid template used to prepare the radiolabelled RNA probe for the Oct-2 RNase protection assay was constructed by blunting the 360-bp TikIII1-HindIII fragment of mouse Oct-2 cDNA ( 9 ) and ligating it into the Smal site of pGEM3Z ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) .
The template was linearized with HindIII and transcribed by using T7 RNA polymerase ( Promega ) in accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions .

Quantitations .
Radioactivity in bands on EMSAs , Northern blots , and RNase protection assays was directly measured by using a Phosphorimager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) .
RESULTS Expression of Oct-2 protein in highly purified human and mouse T-cell preparations was investigated by using an EMSA with a radiolabelled oligonucleotide probe containing an octamer DNA motif .
Extracts from CD4* T cells ( Fig .
1A ) and CD8* T cells ( Fig .
1B ) purified from human peripheral blood and mouse lymph node T cells ( Fig .
1C ) contained DNA-binding activities indistinguishable in migration from those of the Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins present in an extract of the B-cell line WEHI 231 .
Neither Oct-1 nor Oct-2 bands were seen with T-cell extracts when a probe in which the octamer motif was mutated was used ( Fig .
1B , lane 4 , and 1C , lane 2 , and data not shown ) .
The Oct-2 bands from the mouse and human T-cell extracts were inhibited by addition of anti-Oct-2 serum to the binding reactions , and a new band with slower mobility was generated which represents the binding of Oct-2 to antibody ( Fig .
1A , lanes 4 and 5 , 1B , lane 8 , and 1C , lane 4 ) .
The anti-Oct-2 serum used was specific for a peptide derived from a region of Oct-2 that is not conserved among other POU domain transcription factors .
Thus , by immunologic and biochemical criteria , nontransformed human and mouse T cells express Oct-2 protein .
To determine whether Oct-2 could be induced in normal T cells in response to a cognate antigen , we chose to study a nontransformed murine T-cell clone , A.E7 , which resEonds to a pigeon cytochrome c peptide in the context of I-E `` ( 11 ) .
We prepared nuclear extracts from A.E7 cells at various times after antigen stimulation and assayed them for octamer-binding proteins by EMSAs using a radiolabelled oligonucleotide containing the NF-IL-2A sequence from the mouse IL-2 gene .
Binding activities which comigrated with Oct-1 and Oct-2 were observed when extracts from resting and antigen-stimulated A.E7 cells were used ( Fig .
2 ) .
Fur-thermore , both resting and activated A.E7 cells expressed Oct-2 protein , as judged by reactivity with an antiserum specific for Oct-2 ( Fig .
3 , lanes 1 , 2 , 9 , and 10 ) .
Following antigen stimulation , Oct-2-binding activity was slightly increased at 3 h and markedly increased at 9 and 24 h after stimulation ( Fig .
2 , lanes 1 , 5 , and 6 ) .
In separate experi-ments , Oct-2 was not induced detectably at 1.5 h poststim-ulation but did increase progressively in abundance from 3 to 9 h ( data not shown ) .
Maximal levels of Oct-2 were observed at 9 h following activation and were sixfold greater than resting levels .
The abundance of Oct-2 in activated A.E7 cells approached that of the BJAB B-cell lymphoma cell line , which expresses the highest levels of Oct-2 found in any cell line analyzed to date ( Fig .
2 , compare lanes 5 and 7 ) .
In contrast to Oct-2 levels , Oct-1 levels increased less than twofold following antigen stimulation .
To assess whether continued antigen stimulation was necessary for this increase in Oct-2 , we separated the T cells from the antigen and APCs after 3 h of stimulation , placed them back in culture , and prepared extracts at various times thereafter .
Oct-2 levels continued to increase over time in T cells that had been removed from the antigen stimulus at 3 h ( Fig .
2 , lanes 2 to 4 ) .
Thus , as is the case with many other events following T-cell activation , all of the signals necessary for Oct-2 induction were delivered within the first few hours of activation ( 31 ) .

Expression of Oct-2 protein in human and mouse T cells .
( A ) EMSA of whole-cell extracts prepared from human CD4* peripheral blood T cells ( lanes 3 to 5 ) or WEHI 231 B-lymphoma cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) using the radiolabelled Igx promoter oligonucleotide probe .
Extracts were incubated with either preimmune rabbit serum ( lanes 1 and 3 ) or antiserum from a rabbit immunized with a synthetic peptide based on the human Oct-2 sequence ( lanes 2 , 4 , and 5 ) .
Lane 5 is a longer exposure of lane 4 .
Ab , antibody .
( B ) EMSA of whole-cell extracts of human CD8* T cells ( lanes 2 , 4 , 7 , and 8 ) or WEHI 231 B-lymphoma cells ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) using either a radiolabelled wild-type ( WT ) Igx promoter oligonucleotide probe ( lanes 1 , 2 , and 5 to 8 ) or a mutant ( MUT ) Igx promoter oligonucleotide probe ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Extracts were mixed with preimmune serum ( lanes 5 and 7 ) or anti-Oct-2 serum ( lanes 6 and 8 ) .
In lane 8 , the band representing Oct-2 complexed with antibody is faint but comigrated with the corresponding band seen when WEHI 231 extract was used ( lane 6 ) .
( C ) EMSA of whole-cell extracts of mouse mesenteric lymph node T cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or WEHI 231 B-lymphoma cells ( lane 3 ) using either a radiolabelled wild-type Igx promoter oligonucleotide probe ( lanes 1 , 3 , and 4 ) or a mutant Ig « x promoter oligonucleotide probe ( lane 2 ) .
The lane 4 reaction contained anti-Oct-2 serum .
has been shown to be at least partly mediated by calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation , a process that can be mimicked by treatment with ionomycin and PMA ( 3 , 17 , 21 ) .
We therefore studied the signal requirements for Oct-2 activation in A.E7 cells .
Oct-2 was not induced by PMA alone and only slightly induced by ionomycin alone but was induced eightfold by ionomycin and PMA together ( Fig .
3 ) .
We next investigated whether induction of Oct-2-binding activity in A.E7 was due to a posttranslational modification of pre-existing Oct-2 protein or to accumulation of Oct-2 mRNA .
An RNase protection assay for Oct-2 mRNA showed a small amount of Oct-2 mRNA in resting A.E7 cells , which increased 12- and 28-fold after 3 and 6 h of antigen stimulation , respectively ( Fig .
4 , lanes 1 to 3 ) .
This increase in Oct-2 mRNA was almost completely blocked by addition of CsA ( Fig .
4 , lanes 4 and 5 ) and partially blocked by addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin ( Fig .
4 , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
Induction of Oct-2-binding activity in an EMSA was also blocked by treatment with CsA or anisomycin ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION The present report demonstrates that Oct-2 is expressed in normal CD4 * and CD8 * T lymphocytes and that Oct-2 levels can be induced by activation of T cells with their cognate antigen .
Previous studies of Oct-2 gene expression in the hematopoietic system focusing on transformed cell lines have shown Oct-2 in cell lines derived from B- and T-lym-phoid , myeloid , and erythroid lineages ( 5 , 27 ) .
Outside of the hematopoietic system , Oct-2 mRNA can be detected in the fetal spinal cord , in adult brain , and at low levels in a few other tissues ( 9 , 10 ) .
Quantitatively , however , Oct-2 levels vary greatly but are generally much higher in B-cell lines than in other cell lines ( 5 , 21 , 25 ) .
An important observation in the present study , therefore , is that the levels of Oct-2 protein in normal T cells can be as high as those found in B lymphocytes .
The levels of Oct-2 protein induced in the A.E7 normal T-cell clone by stimulation with antigen or PMA plus ionomycin approached the highest levels seen in any B-cell tumor line .
Some transcriptional responses have been shown to behave nonlinearly in that only after the level of a transcription factor exceeds a threshold is any transcription stimulation observed ( 7 ) .
Thus , the low levels of Oct-2 expression found in many cell types could conceivably fall below a functional threshold whereas the higher levels found in B cells and certain T cells could be functionally signifi-cant .
An interesting unresolved issue is whether T cells which express high levels of Oct-2 ( e.g .
, A.E7 ) are functionally or developmentally distinct from T cells which do not express Oct-2 ( as represented by the Jurkat T-lymphoma cell line ) .
What might the functional role of Oct-2 expression in T cells be ?
Previously , it has been shown that the EL4 T-cell line , which expresses high levels of Oct-2 , requires only PMA treatment to induce IL-2 promoter activity ( 8 ) .

Ag , antigen .
larly , transfection of Oct-2 expression vectors into the Jurkat T-cell line allows the IL-2 promoter to be induced by PMA treatment alone ( 13 ) .
An interesting possibility , therefore , is that the presence of Oct-2 in T cells functionally substitutes , in part , for a calcium signal that is usually required for induction of many genes following T-cell activation .
Thus , in T cells which express Oct-2 , some genes might respond differently to T-cell activation signals from the way they do in T cells which lack Oct-2 .
Nevertheless , it is unlikely that the inducibility of Oct-2 protein in A.E7 cells contributes to early transcriptional induction of the IL-2 gene .
In A.E7 cells , initial induction of IL-2 mRNA begins at 1 h following activation , well before the first detectable increase in Oct-2 protein ( 13b ) .
Indeed , IL-2 is induced in many T cells ( exemplified by the Jurkat cell line ) which lack readily detectable Oct-2 .

Induction of Oct-2 protein by treatment of A.E7 T cells with PMA and ionomycin ( Iono ) .

the octamer-containing NF-IL-2A site in these cells appears to be mediated by cooperative binding of Oct-l to this element with an inducible protein ( 30 ) .
In light of the extensive homology of Oct-1 and Oct-2 in their POU do-mains , it will be interesting to test whether Oct-2 can also interact with the same inducible protein .
Stimulation of T lymphocytes with cognate antigen or pharmacologic agents results in the induced expression of a large array of genes ( 31 ) .
This highly ordered program of gene expression begins within 15 min of activation with expression of the immediate-early family of genes .
Subse-quently , various genes are expressed with characteristic time courses over several days to weeks .
The increased expression of many of these T-cell activation genes is due , at least in part , to increased transcription .
Several of the immediate-early activation genes are themselves transcription factors which are presumed to transactivate other genes in a cascade fashion .
Since the immediate-early transcription Vor .

¢ 9 factors , such as c-fos ( 18 ) and Egr/225 ( 32 ) , are often rapidly down modulated following their induction , they can not directly transactivate genes which are induced many hours following T-cell activation .
One hypothesis , therefore , is that the immediate-early transcription factors turn on a second set of transcription factors which are responsible for the later events of T-cell activation .
The relatively delayed kinetics of Oct-2 induction suggests that Oct-2 is such a downstream component of a regulatory cascade that follows T-cell activation .
Oct-2-binding levels were first increased at 3 h following stimulation with a cognate antigen , which is approximately the same time course as is seen with other targets of the immediate-early transcription factors , such as IL-2 ( 31 ) .
Most impor-tantly , Oct-2 levels remained induced for at least 24 h following stimulation so that Oct-2 could also potentially act as a late mediator of T-cell activation signals .
