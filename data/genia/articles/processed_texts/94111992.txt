In T lymphoma cells , the activity of the II-4 promoter/enhancer is stimulated by phorbol esters , Ca++ ionophores and agonists of protein kinase A and inhibited by low doses of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A .
The II-4 promoter/enhancer is transcriptionally inactive in B lymphoma cells and HeLa cells .
DNase I footprint protection experiments revealed six sites of the II-4 promoter/enhancer to be bound by nuclear proteins from lymphoid and myeloid cells .
Among them are four purine boxes which have been described to be important sequence motifs of the II-2 promoter .
They contain the motif GGAAA and are recognized by the inducible and cyclosporin A-sensitive transcription factor NFAT-1 .
Three of the II-4 NFAT-1 sites are closely linked to weak binding sites of Octamer factors .
Several purine boxes and an AT-rich protein-binding site of the 11-4 promoter are also recognized by the high mobility group protein HMG I ( Y ) .
Whereas the binding of NFAT-1 and Octamer factors enhance the activity of the II-4 promoter , the binding of HMG I ( Y ) suppresses its activity and , therefore , appears to be involved in the suppression of I1-4 transcription in resting T lymphocytes .
INTRODUCTION Peripheral CD4+8~ T lymphocytes play a key role in the immune response and differentiation of the immune system .
The majority of these so-called T helper ( Th ) cells are in a resting state , i.e .
they neither secrete cytokines nor do they proliferate .
Due to the interaction with presented antigens and/or other inducers , Th cells synthesize and secrete Interleukin 2 ( I-2 ) and further cytokines .
According to the patterns of secreted cytokines , Th cell clones have been classified into several subtypes .
Two T helper subtypes , Thl and Th2 cells , have been described in the mouse .
Th1 and Th2 cells synthesize distinct sets of cytokines .
Thi cells predominantly synthesize and secrete I1-2 , Interferon-y and Lymphctoxin and are responsible for delayed type hypersensitivity functions , whereas Th2 cells synthesize 1-4 , 11-5 , 11-6 and I-10 ( but not II-2 and Interferon-y ) and are more efficient helpers for antibody production ( see 1 for a review ) .
Although Th1 and Th2 cells apparently represent the endpoints of a wide spectrum of cytokine patterns , there are in vivo situations , particularly in parasitic infections , in which the distinct Th1 and Th2 subtypes contribute in a large extent to the immune response ( see 2 ) .
The molecular mechanisms which account for the divergent expression of cytokine genes in different subsets of T lymphocytes have not been characterized .
Although in peripheral T lymphocytes , and numerous T cell clones , several activation signals simultaneously induce the synthesis of II-2 as well as II-4 RNA ( see Fig .
1A ) , there are numerous other signals which exert contrasting effects on the expression of 1-2 and I1-4 genes and the production of both lymphokines .
Examples of the latter signals include agonists of protein kinase A ( PKA ) and steroid hormones .
Treatment of T cells with forskolin or prostaglandin E , which results in an increase of intracellular cyclic AMP levels , leads to the suppression of 1-2 production while it fails to suppress the synthesis of I1-4 ( 3-5 ) .
A negative effect on the activity of the II-2 promoter ( 6 , 7 ) and I-2 production has also been described for glucocorticoid hormones in several T cell lines and splenic T cells .
In the latter the synthesis of I1-4 was even found to be enhanced after glucocorticoid administration ( 8 ) .
The simultaneous induction of H-2 and II-4 genes in T lymphocytes might be regulated through sets of short homologous DNA sequence elements which have been detected within the immediate upstream regions of murine and human II-2 and I1-4 genes ( 9-11 ) .
While there are numerous detailed investigations on the transcriptional control of human and murine Il-2 genes , there are so far only a few reports about the transcriptional control of the I1-4 gene at the molecular level .
Henkel et al .
( 12 ) have * To whom correspondence should be addressed * On leave from the Shemyakin Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry , Vavilov Street , Moscow , Russia analysed an intronic enhancer of the murine II-4 gene which appears to be involved in the expression of the I1-4 gene in mast cells but not in T lymphocytes .
Abe et al .
( 13 ) have investigated one sequence element from the human II-4 promoter .
This element was designated as P sequence ( corresponding Pu-bys of our designation : see Fig .
8 ) and thought to distinguish the activity of II-4 and II-2 genes in T lymphocytes .
Li-Weber et al .
( 14 ) have identified T cell-specific negative sequence motifs within the upstream region of the human I1-4 gene which are supposed to be responsible for the stringent negative control of I-4 transcription in T cells .
In this study we analysed the transcriptional control of the murine II-4 gene in T lymphoma cells .
We identified a strong transcriptional enhancer within the immediate upstream region of the II-4 gene which shares both common and divergent properties with the promoter/enhancer of the murine 1-2 gene ( 15 ) .
Similar to the II-2 enhancer , the activity of the II-4 enhancer is induced by phorbol esters , Ca++ ionophores and plant lectins in T lymphoma cells , but not in B lymphoma cells or HeLa cells .
Its activity is suppressed by low doses of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , but not-as for the II-2 enhancer-by agonists of PKA .
The II-4 promoter/enhancer segment is bound by transcription factors which were also identified to bind and to control the II-2 enhancer activity , such as NFAT-1 and Octamer factors , and by HMG I ( Y ) , a member of the high mobility group ( HMG ) proteins .
However , other factors which also control the 1-2 enhancer activity , in particular NF-xB like proteins , were not found to bind to the I1-4 promoter/enhancer .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells , DNA transfections and CAT assays Murine E14 T lymphoma cells , human Jurkat T lymphoma cells and murine P815 mastocytoma cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum to densities of 2-4 X 10° cells per ml .
The T lymphoma cells were transfected using a modified DEAE dextran sulfate protocol as described earlier ( 15 ) .
20 h after transfection the cells were divided , one half of the cells was induced with the phorbol ester TPA ( 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ; 10 ng per ml ) and the Ca++ ionophore ionomycin ( 0.5 4M ) , the other half of cells was used as uninduced control .
In other experiments , the cells were also induced by ConA ( Concanavalin A ; 2.5 ug per ml ) instead of ionomycin and , in addition , by forskolin ( 5 aM ) , an agonist of protein kinase A ( PKA ) , or treated by CsA ( 100 ng/m ! )
which was given 2 h after the inducers .
The cells were incubated for another 20 h , harvested , sonicated and the CAT activities were measured as described earlier ( 15 ) .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared by densitiy gradient centrifugation over Ficoll/Metrizoate and the T lymphocytes were enriched by rosetting ( 16 ) .
DNA cloning Recombinant DNA work was done according to standard procedures .
The series of IL4CAT constructs containing various DNA segments from the immediate upstream region of the murine II-4 gene ( Fig .
1C ) was obtained by cloning the fragment of the construct pMILS5 ( 9 ) between the HindII/ BamHI sites of the CAT vector pBLCAT2 ( 17 ) which resulted in the construct IL4-797 ( containing the upstream I-4 DNA from -12 to -797 ) .

The upstream DNA fragment from -12 to -270 in the construct IL4-270 was synthesized by PCR and cloned into pBLCATS ( which was constructed by P.Stein , Karlsruhe , and lacks an inducible TRE-like element within the plasmid DNA ) .
All IL-4 promoter segments of original ILA4-CAT plasmids were transfered into pBLCATS5 .
Construct IL4-270 was used for the introduction of point mutations into the II-4 promoter .

The constructs 3 XPu-ba , 3 XPu-bs ; and 3 X Pu-bg.oy harbor two copies of Pu-boxes in the orientation of CAT gene transcription and one in the opposite orientation .
The plasmid IL4-270D containing the 1-4 promoter/enhancer downstream of the CAT gene was constructed by inserting the blunt-ended EcoRI -HindIII fragment of IL4-270 into the Smal site of pBLCATS5 .
Vectors for the expression of HMG I ( Y ) were constructed by the insertion of an EcoRI fragment containing the complete HMG I ( Y ) cDNA ( 19 ) into the expression vector pSGS ( 20 ) in sense or anti-sense orientation .
DNA/protein binding studies Whole-cell protein extracts were prepared as previously described ( 15 ) .
Extracts were prepared from 3-10 g packed deep-frozen cells stimulated for 4 h by TPA/ConA .

In Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays ( EMSAs ) , crude nuclear protein extracts were used which were prepared according to a published protocol ( 21 ) .
2 ug protein was incubated with 5000 cpm ( equivalent to about 0.2 ng ) of a P-labelled oligonucleotide probe and 2 ug poly dI - dC as unspecific inhibitor as described ( 22 ) .
After incubation for 20-30 min on ice , the samples were fractionated on non-denaturing 5 % polyacrylamide ( PAA ) gels at 200 V/15 cm at room temperature followed by autoradiography .
For the detection of binding of HMG I ( Y ) to the minor groove of DNA , the EMSAs were done in the presence of poly dG - dC instead of poly dI - dC as unspecific competitor .
In the Oct-2A antibody experiment ( Fig .
4B ) , antiserum and nuclear extracts were pre-incubated for 30 min on ice before the addition of labelled probe .
The Oct-2A antibody ( a kind gift of T.Wirth ) was raised against Vaccinia-expressed Oct-2A , but cross-reacted weakly with Oct-1 as well .

Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al .
( 28 ) , dialysed against buffer D containing 100 mM KCl and fractionated on a ffQ-Sepharose column which was eluted in a stepwise manner with buffer D containing 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 2 M KCI , respectively .
The 0.2 M KCI fraction was loaded on a Hi Trap-blue column ( Pharmacia ) followed by stepwise elution with buffer D containing 0.4 M , 1.5 M and 2 M NaCl .
The 1.5 M fraction was dialysed and subsequently fractionated on a Mono S column ( Pharmacia ) .
This column was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 2 M NaCl ( in buffer D ) .
The HMG I ( Y ) protein was eluted between 0.9 M and 1 M NaCl and gave rise to one protein band of approximately 18 kD .
RNA analyses For the semiquantitative determination of I1-4 and I1-2 RNAs in E14 cells ( Fig .

One ug of RNA was converted into cDNA using oligo ( dT ) primers and AMV reverse transcriptase ( RT ) .
PCR reactions were set up with 1/25 of the cDNA according to published protocols ( 29 ) with Taq polymerase ( Promega ) and the following primers : I1-2 : ' primer : 5° ATGTACAGCATGCAGCTCGATC 3 `` 5 3 ' primer : 5° GGCTTGTTGAGATGATGCTTTGACA 3 `` Ii-4 : _ 5 ' primer : 5° ATGGGTCTCAACCCCCAGCTAGT 3 3 ' primer : 5° GCTCTTTAGGCTTTCCAGGAAGTC 3 `` 5 ' primer : 5° CCAGGTCATCACTATTGGCAACGA 3 ' 3 ' primer : 5° GAGCAGTAATCTCCTTCTGCATCC 3 ' After 20-30 cycles , 2.5 ul of samples were separated on 2.5 % agarose gels .
Using these primers , DNA segments of 502 bp ( I-2 ) , 399 bp ( I1-4 ) and 224 bp ( actin ) were synthesized ( Fig .

Detection of binding of protein factors to the I1-4 promoter/enhancer by DNase I footprinting .
( A ) DNase I footprint protection of proximal II-4 promoter DNA by protein extract from E14 T cells enriched by heparin-agarose column chromatography and an enriched TCEp protein preparation .
An I1-4 promoter DNA probe ( labelled at the EcoRI site near nucleotide position -12 in construct IL4-307 ) was incubated with 50 ug ( lane 1 ) or 100 ug ( lane 2 ) of partially purified extract from El4 T cells induced for 4 h by TPA/ConA ( 10 ng/ml , 2.5 ug/m ! )
.
In lane 3 , the promoter probe was incubated with a TCEp-protein preparation which , after fractionation on heparin-agarose and Sephacryl $ 300 columns , was enriched by chromatography on an affinity column containing multimers of TCEp motif of I1-2 enhancer ( see 26 ) .

In lane 4 , the probe was incubated with TCEp protein ( see above and Materials and Methods } .
immunosuppressant CsA ( Fig .

The construct remained transcriptionally inactive in A20J B lymphoma cells and HeLa cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
The transcriptional activity of this DNA segment was also induced from a position downstream of the CAT gene ( as in construct IL4-270D , Fig .
1C ) and , therefore , shows the typical properties of a transcriptional enhancer .
Since point mutations at numerous sites of the enhancer resulted in a decrease of its activity , the minimal size of the Il-4 promoter/enhancer spans approximately 260 bp DNA , i.e .
it is of a similar size to the murine II-2 enhancer ( 275 bp ; 15 ) .
However , while the DNA sequences upstream of the II-2 enhancer exert only a minor effect on its inducible activity in T lymphoma cells ( 15 , 30 ) , those located upstream of the I1-4 enhancer are crucial for its activity .
Similar to the human I-4 promoter ( 14 ) , the sequences between -270 and -307 suppress the induction of the murine II-4 promoter since the construct IL4-307 containing this DNA segment showed only one fifth of CAT activity compared to the construct 14-270 .
This suppression is partly relieved by additional positively acting elements located further upstream .

Supershift assays .
( A ) Supershift assays with Jun/Fos specific antibodies .
Nuclear protein extracts from El4 cells induced for 3 h with TPA/ionomcin were incubated with a TREcoll probe ( lanes above ) or a Pu-by probe ( below ) .
In lanes 2-15 0.5 pl ( even lanes ) or 2 l ( odd lanes ) of the respective Jun/Fos specific antibodies were added shortly after the addition of nuclear proteins to the EMSAs , followed by one h incubation on ice .
In lanes 1 , 16 and 17 no antibodies were added .
For competition , in lane 16 , a 25 fold molar excess of TREcoll ( above ) or Pu-by ( below ) was addedd , in lane 17 the same amount of Oct DNA .
( B ) EMSAs with an a-Oct-2A specific antibody .
Nuclear proteins of El4 cells induced for 3 h with TPA/ionomycin in the presence of CsA ( 100 ng/ml ) were incubated with an Oct probe ( lanes 1-5 ) or an Pu-by probe ( lanes 6-11 ) .
As indicated the assays were incubated for 30 min on ice with increasing amounts of a-Oct-2A antiserum before the addition of probe .
The -Oct-2A antibody ( a kind gift of T. Wirth ) was raised against Vaccinia expressed Oct-2A and reacts weakly with Oct-1 as well .
In lanes 1 , 6 and 11 no antiserum was added .
For competition , in lane 11 , a 50 fold molar excess of Oct DNA was added .
of these sites carry the motif GGAAA which is also part of two purine boxes within the murine II-2 promoter ( 31 ) .
This suggests that the purine boxes of 1-2 and II-4 promoters are bound by similar factors .
In analogy to the I1-2 purine boxes , we designated the four II-4 purine boxes as Pu-b , , Pu-bs , and Pu-bp .
Some of the Pu-boxes were partially protected by proteins from HeLa cells , whereas the two non-Pu-boxes which we designated as boxes I and HI were completely protected by proteins from HeLa cells ( Fig .
8A ) .
This suggests that boxes I and II are bound by ubiquitous factors , whereas the purine boxes appear to be recognized by cell type-specific factors .
In parallel footprint experiments , factors AP-1 , AP-3 and the Octamer factors Oct-1 and Oct-2A bound to several sites of the I1-4 promoter .
However , the protection over these sites did not coincide with that of cellular proteins ( not shown ) .
This indicates that these factors bind in concert with other factors to the Il-4 promoter .
In particular , this appears to be true for AP-1 which appears to interact with other factors in the generation of NFAT-1 , the most prominent purine box factor ( 32-34 ) , and for the Octamer factors which , along with NFAT-1 , bind to several of II-4 purine boxes ( see below ) .
The purine boxes of the Il-4 promoter are NFAT-1 binding sites In order to test whether the II-4 Pu-boxes are bound by NFAT-1 , we compared the proteins binding to the four I1-4 Pu-boxes with those binding to the II-2 Pu-boxes in EMSAs .
As shown in Fig .
3A , incubation of Pu-bs ( II-4 ) and Pu-b ; , ( II-2 ) probes with nuclear proteins from uninduced El4 cells or from cells induced for 4 h by TPA/ionomycin , in the absence or presence of CsA , resulted in very similar factor complexes .
The most prominent complex generated with both probes is inducible by TPA/ConA ( compare lanes 1 and 2 with 11 and 12 ) , and this induction is totally suppressed by low doses of CsA ( see lanes 8 and 17 ) .
Likewise , the addition of an excess of unlabeled Pu-b4 , and Pu-b ; DNAs to the assays competed with the factor binding to both probes ( see lanes 3-5 and 13-15 ) , whereas the same excess of a consensus Octamer site ( Oct ; lanes 7 , 9 and 18 ) or an Octamer site of the II-2 promoter ( UPS ; lanes 6 and 16 ) prevented the binding of Oct-like factors to the Pu-boxes .
Similar results were also obtained for the Pu-boxes A ( Fig .
3B ) , C ( Fig .
3C ) and D ( not shown ) .
These observations , ( i ) the induction of factor binding , ( ii ) its inhibition by low doses of CsA and ( iii ) the competition of factor binding by each Pu-box probe indicate that the most prominent factor binding to the II-4 Pu-boxes is indistinguishable from NFAT-1 .
The partial competition by consensus sequences for the binding of AP-1 and Ets factors ( Fig .
3B ) , which have binding properties in common with NFAT-1 ( 32-34 ) , are a further indication for the binding of NFAT-1 .
This conclusion is supported by site-directed mutagenesis since mutation of two G residues within the sequence GGAAA of all Pu-boxes completely abolished the binding of NFAT-1 to the 5700 Nucleic Acids Research , 1993 , Vol .

The Octamer-like sequence ATGTAAAC of Pu-by is a target for the binding of Octamer factors .
( A ) Chimeric GST-Oct-l protein binds to Pu-by DNA and Pu-by-NM DNAs but binds only poorly to a Pu-by.qy probe containing a mutated Octamer motif .
20 ng GST-Oct-1 protein was incubated with a Pu-by ( lanes 2-4 ) , Pu-bg.yy ( lanes 5-7 ) or Pu-bg opy probe ( lanes 8-10 ) .
Note the weak binding of chimeric Octamer protein to the Pu-bg.qy probe with the mutated Octamer site ATGTGGAC .
In lane 1 , no protein was added to the probe .

These G residues have previously been shown to be contact points of NFAT-1 ( 31 , 33 ) .
In order to test which members of AP-1 ( Jun/Fos ) family of transcription factors are part of NFAT factors binding to the I1-4 Pu-boxes in supershift experiments we used a panel of antibodies specific for all the known members of Jun/Fos factor family .
Using a TRE consensus site and nuclear proteins from induced El4 cells , the incubation with « -JunD , « -c-Fos , « -FosB and Fra-1 resulted in distinct supershifts .
No supershifts were detected with -c-Jun and -Fra-2 ( Fig .
4A ) .
However , using a Pu-by probe in the supershift assays , ~-Fra-2 gave rise to the most prominent supershift , and a weak reaction was also observed for « -JunB ( which can hardly be seen in Fig .
4A but in the original autoradiographs ) .
Since identical results were obtained with a Pu-b , probe of II-2 promoter ( not shown ) , Fra-2 ( and JunB ) proteins appear to be the most prevalent AP-1 components of NFAT in E14 T lymphoma cells .
Three of four purine boxes are also weak binding sites for octamer factors EMSAs of nuclear proteins from induced and CsA-treated El4 cells with the Pu-boxes B , C and D revealed the weak binding of Octamer factors to these sites ( Figs .
3 , A and C ) .
The Octamer-like complexes appear to be formed by the binding of the ubiquitous factor Oct-1 and the lymphoid-specific factors Oct-2A and Oct-2B to the purine boxes since ( i ) they show the same electrophoretic mobility as complexes generated by the incubation of an Octamer binding site ( such as the UPS motif of the II-2 enhancer : Fig .
3A , lane 25 ) , ( ii ) their generation was specifically competed by an excess of genuine Octamer DNA ( Fig .
3A ) and ( iii ) suppressed in pre-incubations with antibodies raised against Vaccinia-expressed Oct-2A ( Fig .
4B ) .
This conclusion is supported by the specific binding of chimeric recombinant GST-Oct-1 and GST-Oct-2A proteins to Pu-by DNA ( Fig .
5A and unpublished results ) .

20 h later , the cells were divided .
One third of the cells was left as uninduced control ( C ) , one induced by TPA/ionomycin ( 10 ng/ml , 0.5 aM ) ( T/T ) or induced and treated by CsA ( 100 ng/ml ) ( T/A+CsA ) .

sequences adjacent to their GGAAA motifs ( Fig .
8A and B ) which might be the target of Octamer factors .
This was proven for the Pu-boxs since conversion of the underlined A residues in the Octamer like sequence ATGTAAAC to G residues markedly diminished the binding of chimeric GST-Oct-1 protein to the Pu-bg.oy , probe whereas mutation of the NFAT-1 binding sequence GGAAA ( in the Pu-bg yy probe ) was without effect on the Octamer binding ( Fig .
5A , lanes 5-10 ) .
The Pu-by and Pu-by sequences also contain TAAT motifs ( Fig .
8A ) which correspond to binding sites of homeodomain proteins ( 35 ) .
The binding of NFAT and octamer factors to the II-4 Pu-boxes contributes to the I1-4 promoter activity The binding of NFAT to the purine boxes plays a crucial role in the induction of the II-4 promoter in E14 T lymphoma cells .

Box II ( lanes 1-10 ) , TCEp ( lanes 11-14 ) , Adenovirus major late TATA box ( lane 15 ) , TCEd ( lane 16 ) , Pu-by ( lane 17 ) or probes ( lane 18 ) were incubated with isolated HMG I ( Y ) protein ( lanes 1-5 ) or nuclear proteins from human peripheral T lymphocytes induced for 15 h by TPA/ionomycin ( lanes 6-18 ) .
Since HMG proteins interact with the minor groove of DNA , poly dG-dC was added as unspecific competitor ( in lanes 6-18 ; 1 ug per assay ) .
For specific competition , 50 ng of the following oligonucleotides were added : lanes 2 , 7 and 12 , box II , lanes 3,8 and 13 , the TATA box of Adenovirus major late promoter ; lanes 4 and 9 , TCEp ; lanes 5 , 10 and 14 , TREp ( see Materials and Methods ) .

This can be concluded from the introduction of point mutations into all four purine boxes .
As shown in Fig .
6A for the construct IL4-270 ( 4M ) , when the GGAAA sequences of all four purine boxes were mutated , the promoter activity was completely abolished .
Mutating one of four purine boxes resulted in quite different effects on the promoter activity .
Whereas the mutations in Pu-bp and , albeit less dramatic , Pu-by and Pu-b ; had strong inhibitory effects on the promoter activity , the mutation of Pu-ba led only to a moderate decrease of promoter activity ( Fig .
6A ) .
While these results demonstrate the importance of NFAT binding in the inducible activity of the II-4 promoter , they also suggest that the four purine boxes correspond to individual promoter elements .
In order to investigate the activity of single purine boxes in more detail we constructed CAT plasmids bearing multiple copies of Pu-b , or Pu-bg .
When cloned in three copies , both Pu-boxes acted as inducible proto-enhancers after tranfection into El4 cells , and CsA interfered with their induction ( Fig .
6B ) .
As expected , the effect of Pu-by on CAT induction was about threefold higher than that of Pu-b , and , on the other hand , indistinguishable from that of Pu-b ; , from the II-2 promoter ( Fig .
6B ) .
When the activity of Pu-bye was compared to that of Pu-b ; in human Jurkat T cells , surprisingly the Pu-by construct was completely inactive whereas the Pu-b4 construct remained as active as in El4 cells ( Fig .
6B ) .
Since Jurkat cells lack measurable amounts of the lymphoid-specific factor Oct-2 , which is constitutively synthesized in El4 cells ( Fig .
3A , lane 21 ) , one may assume that the binding of Octamer factors , in particular of Oct-2 , to Pu-by is important for the function of the element .
This conclusion finds support in the weak promoter activity of the construct 3 XPu-bg oy which carries three copies of Pu-bg ; with mutations in its Octamer sequence .
In El4 cells , this construct showed only one fourth of activity of the 3 X Pu-by wild-type construct ( Fig .
5B ) .
The binding of HMG I ( Y ) suppresses the II-4 promoter activity Box II ( located around position -200 , Fig .
8A ) is the only promoter site which was bound by proteins isolated by affinity chromatography on a TCEp DNA column in DNase footprint protection experiments ( Fig .
2 ) .
The TCEp ( 'proximal T cell element ' ) is a protein binding site of the II-2 promoter which , in contrast to other sites , did not show any proto-enhancer activity when it was cloned in multiple copies in front of a test gene ( 26 ) .
Box II and the TCEp span a common DNA stretch of six AT base pairs ( Fig .
8B ) which , therefore , corresponds to a binding site of high mobility group ( HMG ) protein I ( Y ) ( 36 ) .
In EMSAs using nuclear proteins from peripheral T lymphocytes , the generation of one prominent factor complex was observed after incubation with box II and TCEp probes ( Fig .
7A , lanes 6 and 11 ) .
The formation of this rapidly migrating complex could be competed by a 100 fold molar excess of homologous probes or the TATA box of Adenovirus major late promoter ( a HMG I ( Y ) binding site ) , but not by the same excess of the TREp , an AP-1 binding site ( Fig .
7A ) .
The complex showed the same 5702 Nucleic Acids Research , 1993 , Vol .

electrophoretic mobility and DNA binding behaviour as a complex which was formed after incubation with purified HMG I ( Y ) isolated from murine Ehrlich ascites tumor cells ( Fig .
7A ) .
This demonstrates that both box II of the I1-4 promoter and the TCEp of the I1-2 promoter are binding sites of HMG I ( Y ) .
There are , however , more HMG I ( Y ) binding sites within the I1-4 promoter than box II .
Among them are the purine boxes Pu-bp and Pu-be which carry stretches of 12 and 8 AT residues , respectively ( Fig .
7A , lanes 17 and 18 ) .
In order to elucidate whether HMG I ( Y ) proteins are involved in the II-4 promoter activity we co-transfected expression vectors containing the HMG I ( Y ) cDNA in the sense or anti-sense orientation with the II-4 promoter CAT construct IL4-270 into E4 cells .
The overexpression of HMG I ( Y ) exerted a distinct suppressive effect on the II-4 promoter activity whereas the opposite effect was observed for the HMG I ( Y ) antisense construct ( Figs .
7B and C ) .
This indicates that HMG I ( Y ) proteins are able to suppress the induction of the II-4 promoter in El4 cells .
This finding is supported by an increase of activity of CAT constructs which carry an II-4 promoter with three G mutations within the stretch of 14 AT residues of box II ( see Materials and Methods and Fig .
8 for the sequence ) ( transfection data not shown ) .
These observations , i.e .
( i ) the high concentration of HMG I ( Y ) in primary T lymphocytes , ( ii ) the decrease of II-4 promoter activity as a result of HMG I ( Y ) overexpression , and ( iii ) the increase of II-4 promoter activity by mutating its most prominent HMG I ( Y ) site demonstrates that HMG I ( Y ) is involved in the repression of Il-4 transcription .
DISCUSSION In this study we have investigated the activity of and the protein factors binding to the murine 1-4 promoter .
We show here that the immediate upstream DNA segment from position -12 to -270 of the murine 1-4 gene harbors a strong inducible and cell type-specific enhancer .
The activity of the II-4 promoter/enhancer can be efficiently induced by agents which activate T cells , its induction is suppressed by low doses of CsA , and it is not inducible in B cells and HeLa cells ( see Figs .
1B and C ) .
Thus , the II-4 promoter/enhancer shares several properties with the 1-2 promoter/enhancer , and several factors which control the I1-2 promoter are also involved in the control of I1-4 promoter activity .
These are NFAT-1 and Octamer factors and , as we show here for the first time , HMG I ( Y ) .
There are four NFAT-1 binding sites within the II-4 promoter .
The binding of NFAT to these sites , the purine boxes , is essential for the promoter activity since the suppression of NFAT -1 binding by mutating the purine boxes abolished the promoter activity .
Moreover , the negative effect of the immmunosuppressant CsA might also be mediated through the NFAT-1 binding sites of the II-4 promoter .
NFAT-1 has originally been described as a T cell-specific I1-2 promoter factor the DNA binding of which is stimulated by the activation of T cells and suppressed by low doses of CsA ( 22 , 31 , 37 , 38 ) .
NFAT-1 appears to consist of ( at least ) two components ; one nuclear AP-1 like component and one cytoplasmic component ( 32 , 39 ) .
For El4 T lymphoma cells we show here that Fra-2 is the most prominent AP-1 like component of NFAT-1 .
The activation of NFAT is controlled by the phosphatase calcineurin which is specifically bound and inhibited by complexes consisting of CsA and cyclophilin ( or FK506 and FKBP ) ( 40-42 ) .
Our results , and those of others ( 43 ) , demonstrate that NFAT-1 is not only involved in the control of the 1-2 promoter but also in that of other lymphokine genes .
Contrary to its original designation ( 37 ) , NFAT-1 occurs also in B lymphocytes ( 22 ) and , as shown here , in myeloid cells .
Three of four NFAT-1 binding sites of the Il-4 promoter are linked to non-canonical Octamer sites .
Although in some of the EMSAs Octamer factors were also found to bind very weakly to the Pu-b , of the II-2 promoter , the binding affinities of Octamer factors to the I1-4 purine boxes B , C and D are stronger than to the 1-2 purine boxes .
The binding affinities are , however , at least 5-10 fold weaker than to the UPS motif of the N-2 promoter or to a consensus Octamer site .
What might be the function of weak binding of Octamer factors to the II-4 purine boxes ?
In transient transfections using E14 cells the Pu-bp behaved like the Pu-by4 of the 1-2 promoter and differed in its induction kinetics from the UPS motif which is bound by Octamer and AP-1 like factors ( 25 ) .
However , in Jurkat T cells , which lack Oct-2 , the Pu-by was uninducible whereas the Pu-b4 was strongly induced upon TPA/ionomycin treatment .
These results and the weak activity of the construct 3 XPu-bg oy containing mutated Octamer sites demonstrate that , in addition to NFAT-1 , Octamer factors play a role in the Pu-bs activity .
Oct-2 is a strong transactivator of the II-2 promoter and inducible in peripheral T lymphocytes , and one may assume that it is also involved in II-4 induction .
The low binding affinity of Octamer factors to the II-4 purine boxes might indicate that higher Oct-2 concentrations are necessary to transactivate the I1-4 gene than the II-2 gene which harbors at least one high affinity Octamer sites .
We have shown here that the II-4 and II-2 promoters are bound by HMG I ( Y ) .
The most prominent HMG I ( Y ) protein binding site of the I1-4 promoter is box II , but several other AT rich promoter sites , such as the Pu-boxes B and C also interact with HMG I ( Y ) .
HMG proteins , which constitute up to 5 % of nuclear chromatin , have been described as regulators of DNA replication ( 44 ) and gene transcription .
For the virus-inducible promoter of the IFN-3 gene it has recently been shown that HMG I ( Y ) stimulates the binding of NF-xB to a non-canonical NF-xB site , and its synthesis appeared to be crucial for the virus-mediated promoter induction ( 45 ) .
Moreover , the binding of HMG I ( Y ) to AT rich stretches of rRNA and lymphotoxin promoters ( 46 , 47 ) has been implicated in the stimulation of transcription of these genes .
In our experiments HMG I ( Y ) exerted a pronounced suppressive effect on the activity of the II-4 promoter .
One target of this suppression is box II but other sequence elements might also be involved .
Experiments are in progress to elucidate in more detail how HMG I ( Y ) suppresses the II-4 promoter activity in T lymphocytes .
Apart from the lack of a high affinity Oct site , the I-4 promoter also lacks NF-xB and AP-1 ( TRE ) sites which are part of the II-2 promoter .
The TREp ( proximal TRE ) of the II-2 promoter has been described to be an important AP-1 binding site through which the effect of T cell clonal anergy and protein kinase C is mediated in untransformed T cells ( 48 , 49 ) .
However , the mutation of TREp to a defective AP-1 binding site had only a minor effect on the II-2 promoter activity in T lymphoma ( El4 ) cells , while that of the xB-like TCEd element abolished promoter Nucleic Acids Research , 1993 , Vol .

24 5703 activity ( 26 and unpubl .
results ) .
In further experiments , the TCEd appeared to be the only II-2 proto-enhancer element the induction of which was impaired by agonists of PKA ( T.Grieshammer et al .
, unpubl .
results ) .
Since the activity of the Il-4 promoter is not suppressed by increased PKA levels ( Fig .
1B ) and high cAMP levels have been detected in Th2 cell clones ( 5 ) , one may speculate that the negative effect of PKA on 1-2 gene activity and T cell proliferation ( for a review see 50 ) is mediated through the xB-like TCEd of the II-2 promoter .
In EMSA experiments using nuclear extracts of different Thl1 ( LNC-2 : 51 ; €57.4 : ; 52 ) and Th2 cell lines ( D10 : 53 ; L1/1 : 54 ) we did not observe significant differences in the patterns of transacting factors when the cells were induced by TPA/ionomycin .
However , differences were observed upon other treatments ( unpublished results ) .
This might imply that Th1 and Th2 cells differ in the existence of various signal transduction pathways .
On the other hand , since Th1 and Th2 cells appear to differentiate from common progenitor cells in which both lymphokines are synthesized ( see 11 ) , one may conclude that the ( promoter ) activity of genes is switched off in the Th cell type where they are not synthesized .
For the II-2 promoter , two sites have been implicated to bind negatively acting factors ( 55 , 56 ) but it remains to be shown whether these factors play a role in the development of Th2 cells .
Similarly , neither of the negatively acting factors binding to the further upstream region of the I1-4 promoter ( between the positions -270 and -307 : see Fig .
1B and 14 ) have been studied in Th1 cells , nor the putative repressor factors binding to the far upstream promoter region in front of position -797 .
Thus , more experiments , in particular in vivo assays , are necessary to elucidate which transcription factors might be involved in the divergent transcription of lymphokine genes in Th cells .
When the preparation of this manuscript was completed two reports appeared on the transcriptional control of human and murine genes ( 57 , 58 ) .
Both communications support our findings on the multiplicity of I-4 promoter elements .
Szabo et al .
( 59 ) described five NFAT/purine box like elements as part of the murine II-4 promoter .
Four of them correspond to our Pu-boxes A -D , whereas the fifth located around position -175 might be inactive in the El4 cell line we used since we never detected any footprint at this site .
In additon , these authors identified the binding of the cloned nuclear factor NF-Y ( 59 ) to box I of the II-4 promoter .
