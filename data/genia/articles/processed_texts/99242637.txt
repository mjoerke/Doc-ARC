Expression of Grf40 is predominant in hematopoietic cells , particularly T cells Grf40 binds to the SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD ( SLP-76 ) via its SH3 domain more tightly than Grb2 .
Incidentally , Grf40 binds to linker for activation of T cells ( LAT ) possibly via its SH2 domain .
O verexpression of wild-type Grf40 in Jurkat cells induced a significant increase of SLP-76-dependent interleukin ( IL ) -2 promoter and nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NF-AT ) activation upon T cell receptor ( TCR ) stimulation , whereas the COOH-terminal SH3-deleted Grf40 mutant lacked any recognizable increase in IL-2 promoter activity .
Furthermore , the SH2-deleted Grf40 mutant led to a marked inhibition of these regulatory activities , the effect of which is apparently stronger than that of the SH2-deleted Grb2 mu-tant .
Our data suggest that Grf4O0 is an adaptor molecule involved in TCR -mediated signaling through a more efficient interaction than Grb2 with SLP-76 and LAT .
Key words : - Grb2 family « SLP-76 « T cell receptor signaling » nuclear factor of activated T cells Stimulation of the TCR initiates activation of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) ' that trigger downstream signaling pathways including calcium- and Ras dependent events , which ultimately converge upon the nucleus to stimulate the transcription of genes required for proliferation and effector functions of T cells ( 1-4 ) .
Phos pholipase Cy1 , recruited to the plasma membrane after PTK activation , is thought to introduce the calcium-dependent pathway into the TCR -mediated signaling events ( 5 , 6 ) .
On the other hand , the pathway for Ras activation after PTK activation in T cells is still controversial .
Grb2 , an adaptor protein containing an SH3-SH2-SH3 motif , forms a complex with Sos , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor , via its NH -terminal SH3 domain after TCR ligation ( 7-9 ) .
Hence , the Grb2-Sos complex is thought to contribute to Ras activation in T cells , although there has been no empirical evidence for this notion .
The COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 has been shown to bind to the SH2 domain-containing leukocyte ' A bbreviations used in this paper : LAT , linker for activation of T cells ; NF-AT , nuclear factor of activated T cells PTK , protein tyrosine kinase ; SLP-76 , SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD ; STAM , signal transducing adaptor molecule .
1383 protein of 76 kD ( SLP-76 ) , a hematopoietic cell-specific adaptor protein , which is tyrosine phosphorylated rapidly after TCR stimulation ( 10-12 ) .
Mice targeted for SLP-76 gene engendered defects of double-positive T cells in the thymus and of peripheral T cells as a consequence of impaired pre-TCR signaling ( 13 ) .
Furthermore , Jurkat subline J14 cells lacking expression of SLP-76 exhibited defects of both the calcium- and dependent pathways in TCR-mediated signaling .
The defect of the calcium-dependent pathway in this system is ascribed to the fact that tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cy1 are significantly suppressed in J14 cells ( 14 ) .
Although the precise function of SLP-76 in R as activation is still obscure , it is of interest that deletion of the Grb2- binding site of SLP-76 eliminates the ability of SLP-76 to increase IL-2 promoter activity upon stimulation with the TCR ( 15 , 16 ) .
In addi-tion , SLP-76 also binds to Vav , a member of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor family , and cotransfection with SLP-76 and Vav into Jurkat cells induced a synergistic increase of nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NF-AT ) activation upon TCR stimulation ( 17 ) .
These observations suggest that SLP-76 is an indispensable mediator of TCR signaling .
On the other hand , the SH2 domain of Grb2 has been J. Exp .

Hence Grb2 , an adaptor protein , has been considered to be implicated in TCR -mediated signaling .
We here provide evidence that a new Grb2 family member , named Grf40 , is involved in TCR -mediated signaling through its more efficient interaction than Grb2 with SLP-76 and LAT .
Materials and Methods Cloning of the DNA .
- Grf40 cDNA fragments were isolated by a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human PHA-PBL cDNA library ( Clontech ) .
The bait plasmid was constructed by insertion of a cDNA fragment encoding the full-length human AMSH protein ( our unpublished protocol ) in pAS2-1 ( Clontech ) .
The bait plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain C€CG1945 ( Clon-tech ) , followed by transformation with the human PHA-PBL cDN A library .
The transformed strains were selected on dropout plates ( Trp~ , Leu~ , His~ ) with 5 mM 3-aminotriazole .
Positive colonies were subsequently tested for the expression of lacZ .
One clone was determined to contain a homologous sequence to Grb2 ( 7 ) .
To obtain the full-length cDNA , the 800-bp fragment of the above clone was used as a probe for screening a Agtll oligo ( dT ) -primed cDN A library of PHA-PBL .
The sequences of 10 clones were identical , and two of them contained an open reading frame coding for 330 amino acids .
This sequence contains an in-frame stop codon at 114 bp upstream of the first methionine codon , and the sequence around the first methionine ( nucleotides 193-195 ) matches the favorable Kozak consensus se-quence .
A full-length cDNA encoding Grf40 was thus isolated .
Plasmid Construdion .
_ GtfAQ cDNA was generated by PCR using the above full-length cDNA clone as a template and subcloned into Myc-Tag-peDNA3.1 ( + ) to generate the plasmid sequence ( EQ KLISEEDL ) .
pMycGrfO-dSH3N , pMycGrfQ-dSH2 , pMycGrf40-dSH3C , and pMycGrf0-dSH3NC are Myc-tagged Grf40 mutants deleted of the SH3 domain of the NH , terminus ( amino acid position Met'-Pro % ) , deleted of the SH2 domain ( amino acid position Lys*-Thr'* ) , of the SH3 domain of the COOH terminus ( amino acid position Ala `` `` `` -Arg `` `` `` ) , and of the SH3 domains of the NH , , and COOH termini ( amino acid positions Met !
-Pro % ® and Ala `` `` `` -Arg `` `` `` ) , respectively .
pMycGrb2 and pMycGrb2-dSH2 are expression plasmids for the Myc-tagged wild-type Grb2 and Grb2 mutant deleted of the SH2 domain ( amino acid position Trp-Glu'* ) , respectively .
SLP-76 cDNA was generated by PCR and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV-2 ( East-man Kodak Co. ) to generate the plasmid pFlagSLP , possessing an NH-terminal Flag epitope tag ( DYKDDDDK ) .
pFlagSLP-157-533 , pFlagSLP-217-533 , pFlagSLP-241-533 , and pFlagSLP-281-533 are expression plasmids for Flag-tagged SLP-76 mutants deleted of amino acid positions Met'-Lew ' `` `` , Met'-His ?
`` `` , Met'-Lys `` , and Met'-Pro `` * `` , respectively .
pCX-SLP76 is an expression plasmid for the wild-type SLP-76 cloned into the pCXN2 vector ( 19 ) .
Luciferase reporter constructs were as follows : pNFATLuc was constructed by insertion of three tandem copies of the NF-AT binding region ( -286 to -249 of human IL-2 ) linked to the human IL-2 promoter ( -64 to +47 ) into the pGL3-basic vector ( Promega ) ( 20 ) ; pIL2Luc was constructed by insertion of the human IL-2 promoter ( -541 to +57 ) into the pGL3-basic vector ( 21 ) .
pENL is a B-galactosidase expression plasmid ( 22 ) .
All con 1384 structs were sequenced for verification with a DNA sequencer ( model 377 ; Applied Biosystems , Inc. ) .

_ COST cells were electroporated with the indicated plasmids in OPTI-MEM I ( GIBCO BRL ) at a density of 6 X 10° celly 700 p/ cuvette with a gene pulser ( Bio-R ad Laboratories ) set at 1,000 V and 200 F , and then subjected to a Western blot assay 48 h after the trans-fection .
For luciferase assays , Jurkat cells were electroporated with 2.5 jug of pENL and the indicated dose of pIL2Luc or pNFATLuc , along with expression plasmids for SLP-76 , and Grf40 or Grb2 in OPTI-MEM I at a density of 5 X 10° celly 400 pul at 200 V and 950 wF .
The cells were cultured at 37°C for 24 h , and then stimulated for 8 h with 10 g/ ml OKT 3 plus 50 ng/ ml PMA or with 10 pg/ml OKT3 alone .
The cells were then lysed in 300 pl of PicaGene ReporterLysis Buffer ( Toyo Ink ) and assayed for luciferase and -galactosidase activities as described previously ( 25 ) .
Results and Discussion We previously reported a signal transducing adaptor molecule , STAM , which is associated with Janus kinase ( Jak ) 2 and Jak3 and is involved in signal transduction medi- Grf40 Involved in T Cell Signaling ated by IL-2 and GM-CSF ( 26 ) .
We have also recently cloned a cDNA clone encoding a novel molecule , named AMSH , which binds to STAM ( our unpublished results ) .
To address the functional significance of AMSH , we attempted to identify molecules associated with AMSH using the yeast two-hybrid assay system .
One full-length cDNA clone was isolated from a human PHA-PBL cDN A library .
The cDNA clone encodes a molecule homologous to Grb2 , named Grf40 ( for Grb2 family member of 40 kD ) .
The nucleotide sequence of the Grf40 gene has been deposited with GenBank , and is available from EMBL/ Gen-Bank/ DDBJ under accession no .
AFO42380 .
The deduced amino acid sequence of Grf40 consists of 330 amino acid residues .
The schematic structure of Grf40 was compared with Grb2 ( 7 ) and Grap , another Grb2 family member ( 27 , 28 ) .
The NH , - and COOH-terminal SH3 domains and an intermediate SH2 domain of Grf40 are highly homologous to those of Grb2 and Grap , while a unique insert region ( amino acid position Arg ' `` `` -Arg `` `` `` ) containing proline/ glutamine-rich sequences was seen in Grf40 but not Grb2 and Grap ( Fig .
1 A ) .
These results indicate that Grf4O0 is a new member of the Grb2 family .
Various human cell lines were examined for expression of Grf40 by immunoblotting with anti-Grf40 Ab .
Two T cell lines , MOLT-4 and Jurkat , were strongly positive for expression of the 40-kD Grf4O0 , and two B cell lines , Daudi and R aji , were weakly positive , but the other cell lines , including a B cell line ( R amos ) , myeloid cell lines ( THP-1 , TF-1 , and Eol-3 ) , and the nonhematopoietic cell lines ( HeLa and WI-26 ) were all negative for this expression ( Fig .
1 B ) .
In contrast to Grf40 , appreciable expression of Grb2 was seen in all the cell lines ( Fig .
1 B ) .

- Schematic structure and expression of Grf40 .
( A ) The schematic structure of Grf40 was compared with Grb2 and Grap .
The percentages of amino acid identity of the SH3 and SH2 domains of Grf40 with Grb2 and Grap were indicated in terms of their SH3 and SH2 domains .
( B ) 10 cells of a variety of human cell lines were immunoprecipitated ( IP ) and immunoblotted ( IB ) with anti- Grf40 , anti-Grb2 , or preimmune ( control [ Cont ] ) serum .
( C ) Northern blot analyses were performed with the various human tissues indicated .
The blots were first hybridized with the Grf40 probe , then rehy-bridized with B-actin probe .
1385 Asada et al .
analyses on various human cell lines and tissues showed two Grf4O-specific transcripts at 3.5 and 1.5 kb in Jurkat , MOLT-4 , three myeloid cell lines ( KU812 , K562 , and M-TAT ) and PHA-PBL ( data not shown ) , and in human immunotissues such as thymus , spleen , small intestine , and PBL , whereas marginal levels of the transcripts were detected in other tissues , including prostate , testis , ovary , colon , heart , brain , placenta , lung , liver , skeletal muscle , kidney , and pancreas ( Fig .
1 C ) .
These results suggest that Grf4O0 , unlike Grb2 , is predominantly expressed in immunotissues and hematopoietic cells , particularly T cells .
Since Grb2 has been shown to bind to SLP-76 and LAT , which are 76- and 36/ 38-kD tyrosine- phosphorylated proteins essential for TCR-mediated signaling , respectively ( 10 , 11 , 18 ) , we asked ourselves whether or not Grf40 is also associated with SLP-76 and LAT .
We detected 76- and 36/ 38-kD tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with Grf40 in Jurkat cells after stimulation by C Stimulation + TCR cross-linking with OKT3 ( Fig .
2 A ) .
We then confirmed that the 76- and 36/ 38-kD tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were SLP-76 and LAT , respectively , by stimulating Jurkat cells with OKT3 .
Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti- Grf40 Ab , and the immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-LAT , anti-SLP-76 , or anti- Grfi0 Ab .
Grf40 precipitated SLP-76 irrespective of TCR stimulation , but precipitated LAT only after TCR stimulation ( Fig .
2 B ) .
These results indicate the association of Grf40 with SLP-76 and LAT in Jurkat cells .
To determine the association site of Grf40 for SLP-76 , we carried out further coimmunoprecipitation assays between the various deletion mutants of Grf40 and SLP-76 .
COS7 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type Grf4O and four Grf4O mutants deleted of the NH , -terminal SH3 domain ( Grf40-dSH3N ) , the COOH-terminal SH3 domain ( Grf40-dSH3C ) , both the NH , - and COOH-terminal SH3 domains ( GrfO0-dSH3NC ) , or the SH2 domain miogr ' g vector sue-ze € g J a o n $ § $ $ 8 a g § 6 6 3 S3 I I I xr o & o & E E t Q ® r-4 r -- r -- © U % s ke 1B : Py t h m wae cam cae CP « am » - wild a | l - < dSH3N a % .

The transfected CO S7 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-SLP-76 Ab or anti- Mye mAb , and then immunoblotted with anti-Myc mAb or anti-SLP-76 Ab .
Wild-type Grf40 and the Grf40-dSH2 and Grf10-dSH3N mutants were coimmunoprecipitated with SLP-76 , but the Grfi0-dSH3C and Grf10-dSH3NC mutants were not tested ( Fig .
2 C ) .
Conversely , SLP-76 was coimmunoprecipitated with Grf40O-dSH2 , Grf40O-dSH3N , and wild-type Grf4O0 , but not with Grf40-dSH3C and Grf40-dSH3NC mutants ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grf40 is an association site for SLP-76 .
We next determined the association site of SLP-76 for Grf40 by using various SLP-76 mutants .
Flag-tagged wild-type and four mutants of SLP-76 were introduced into CO S7 cells together with Myc-tagged Grf4O0 , and then immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-Flag and anti-Myc Abs .
Myc-tagged Grf40 was coimmunoprecipitated with the SLP-76 mutants consisting of and containing the amino acid position but not with the SLP-76 mutant consisting of the amino acid position Pro**-Pro° > .
These results indicate that the Grf40 binding site is located in the amino acid position Glu® `` `` -Lys `` * `` of SLP-76 ( Fig .
2 D ) .
This Grf40 binding site of SLP-76 almost overlaps the amino acid position Asn*-Asp `` 4 , which has been shown to be the Grb2 binding site ( 15 ) .
On the other hand , the binding site of Grb2 for LAT has been shown to be the SH2 domain of Grb2 , which is thought to bind to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue ( 18 ) .
Together with this notion , we showed that LAT is tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently coimmunoprecipitated with Grf40 after TCR stimulation , suggesting that the SH2 domain of Grf40 is possibly the binding site for LAT .

Grb2 0 1 2.5 been shown to be the binding site for SLP-76 ( 10 , 11 ) , we examined the competitive binding ability between Grf40 and Grb2 to SLP-76 .
COS7 cells were transiently trans fected with 2.5-pg plasmids of Myc-tagged Grf40 and Myc-tagged Grb2 in association with different doses ( 0-1.0 g ) of Flag-tagged SLP-76 plasmid .
Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag mAb and then immunoblotted with anti- Myc polyclonal Ab .
Coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged Grf40 with SLP-76 gradually decreased upon reducing the SLP-76 plasmid dose to 0.05 pg , whereas the Myc-tagged Grb2 coimmunoprecipitation with SLP-76 was detectable only at a 1.0-pmg dose of SLP-76 plasmid ( Fig .
3 A ) .
Expression levels of the plasmids introduced were quantified by immunoblotting , confirming that there was no significant difference in the amounts between Myc-tagged Grf40 and Myc-tagged Grb2 ( Fig .
3 A ) .
These results suggest the possibility that Grf4O0 associated much stronger with SLP-76 than did Grb2 .
To confirm this fur-ther , COS7 cells were transiently transfected with low doses of SLP-76 plasmid ( 0.2 ug ) and Myc-Grf40 plasmid ( 2.5 wg ) together with various doses ( 0-10 pg ) of Myc-tagged Grb2 plasmid .
Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag mAb and then immunoblotted with anti- Myc polyclonal Ab .
Even when up to 10- wg plasmid doses of Myc-tagged Grb2 were cotransfected , coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged Grf4d0 with SLP-76 was still unchanged ( Fig .
3 B ) .
Furthermore , although the increased expression of Myc-tagged Grb2 was dependent on its plas mid dose , which was considerably higher than that of Grf10 at a 10- ppg plasmid dose of Myc-tagged Grb2 , Myc-tagged Grb2 was not coimmunoprecipitated with SLP-76 ( Fig .
3 B ) .

Since the SLP-76 mutant deleted of the Grb2 binding site , which overlaps the Grf40 binding site , failed to increase IL-2 promoter activity upon TCR stimulation ( 15 , 16 ) , it is possible that not only Grb2 but also Grf40 plays a critical role in the SLP-76-dependent increase in IL-2 promoter activity .
To address the functional significance of Grf40 in TCR mediated signaling , we performed luciferase assays with reporter genes containing the IL-2 promoter and the NF- AT binding domain .
Overexpression of wild-type Grf40 did not lead to either basal or TCR -mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter and NF-AT ( data not shown ) .
Since Grf40 interacts with SLP-76 in Jurkat cells , and overexpression of SLP-76 is known to augment TCR -mediated stimulation of the IL-2 promoter and NF-AT activity ( 15 , 16 ) , we used Jurkat cells transiently transfected with SLP-76 to examine the effect of Grf40 in TCR -mediated signaling .
Transfections of wild-type Grf40 and Grf4O-dSH3N mutant into Jurkat cells overexpressing SLP-76 led to significant increases in IL-2 promoter activity upon stimulation with OKT 3 plus PMA , whereas transfection of Grf40-dSH2 mutant induced a marked inhibition of IL-2 promoter activity compared with transfection of an empty vector ( Fig .
4 A ) .
These results indicate that Grf40-dSH2 mutant has a dominant-negative effect in TCR stimulation , suggesting that the SH2 domain of Grf40 interacts with an essential molecule for TCR -mediated signaling , which is possibly LAT ( 18 ) .
Similar results were obtained in NF-AT luciferase assays with Jurkat cells stimulated with OKT 3 ( Fig .
4 B ) .
Furthermore , the Grf40 mutants ( Grfi0-dSH3C and Grf40-dSH3NC ) deleted of the COOH-terminal SH3 domain , which is the binding site for SLP-76 , also lost their ability to increase IL-2 promoter activity ( Fig .
4 A ) , suggesting that a complex formation is required for SLP-76-dependent TCR stimulation .
These results indicate that Grf40 is involved in signaling the stimulation of the IL-2 promoter and NF-AT activities mediated by OKT 3 and PMA .
Since Grb2 has also been considered to be involved in the modulation of TCR -mediated signal transduction ( 9 ) , we compared the functional significance of Grf40 and Grb2 in TCR -mediated stimulation of IL-2 promoter activity .
Jurkat cells overexpressing SLP-76 were transfected with the wild-types and SH2 deletion mutants of Grf40 and Grb2 , in association with an IL-2 promoter-driven luciferase construct .
They were stimulated with OKT3 plus PMA , and assayed for luciferase activity .
An appreciable enhancement of IL-2 promoter activity was seen with wild-type Grf40 , but scarcely with wild-type Grb2 , whereas Grf40-dSH2 mutant showed a marked dominant-negative effect in the IL-2 luciferase assay compared with Grb2-dSH2 mutant ( Fig .
5 A ) .
The plasmid dose dependency in the IL-2 luciferase assay was compared between the Grf4O-dSH2 and Grb2-dSH2 mutants The suppressive effects on the luciferase activities were significantly stronger in Grf40-dSH2 mutant than Grb2-dSH2 mutant at various plasmid doses ( Fig .
5 B ) .
These results indicate that Grf40 is involved in TCR -mediated signaling more effectively than Grb2 .
This conclusion is in accordance with the observation of greater binding affinity of Grf40 to SLP-76 compared with Grb2 .
This study showed a critical involvement of Grf40 in the SLP-76-dependent signaling mediated by the TCR .
One might consider the possibility that Grf40 mutants exert their effects in TCR -mediated signaling by altering expression levels of SLP-76 .
However , this possibility is negligible because the expression of pCX-SLP76 was confirmed to be unaffected by transient expression of Grf4O0 , Grb2 , and their mutants in CO S7 cells ( data not shown ) .
Hence , the interaction of Grf40 with SLP-76 and LAT is thought to be critical for TCR -mediated signaling .
The NH , -terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 is known to be a binding site for Sos , a R as guanine nucleotide exchange factor , which has been considered to be involved in Ras activation upon TCR stimulation ( 9 ) .
We confirmed the association of Grb2 with Sos in Jurkat cells ; however , a complex formation between Grf40 and Sos was undetectable in these cells ( data not shown ) .

Jurkat cells were transfected with 10 jug of IL-2-Luc ( A ) or 10 jug of NF-AT-Luc ( B ) , along with 10 pg of SLP-76 and 10 jug of an empty vector ( vector ) , Myc-tagged wild-type GrfO ( wild ) , or various mutants ( dSH3N , dSH3C , dSH3NC , and dSH2 ) .
The cells were left unstimulated ( white bars ) or were stimulated ( black bars ) with 10 pg/ml OKT 3 plus 50 ng/ ml PMA , and assayed for luciferase activity .
R esults are shown as fold induction of luciferase activity compared with the activity in unstimulated cells transfected with the empty vector ( ~5,000 relative light units [ RLU ] ) .
These results are representative of three comparable experiments .

that Grf40 does not direct the R as activation signaling mediated by the TCR .
However , Grf40 contributes to TCR mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter and NF-AT more effectively than Grb2 , suggesting the critical involvement of Grf40 in TCR -mediated signaling .
In this context , it is of interest that SLP-76 associated with Grf40 also binds to Vav , a R ac/R ho guanine nucleotide exchange factor , and that the interaction between SLP-76 and Vay has been shown to participate in IL-2 gene activation upon TCR stimulation ( 17 ) .
These observations provide a model pathway in which activated ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase after TCR ligation phos phorylates LAT ( 18 ) , which then binds to the preformed Grfi0O-SLP-76 complex and recruits it to ZAP-70 ( 29 ) , which further phosphorylates SLP-76 to be associated with Vav , leading to the downstream signaling of the TCR .
Northern blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that Grf40 is expressed predominantly in immunotissues and hematopoietic cells , particularly T cells , in contrast to Grb2 .
Such restricted distribution of Grf40 may reflect the more efficient involvement of Grf40 in TCR -mediated signaling compared with Grb2 .
Although Grap has also been shown to be specific for hematopoietic and lymphocytic cells ( 28 ) , the functional significance of Grap is still unknown .
The genome sequence of GR B2L has been registered in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ ( under accession no .
282206 ) , which contains the entire sequence of Since GR B2L has been mapped to human chromosome 22q12 , Grf40 is thought to have the same chromosomal location .
Furthermore , cDNA clones identical to Grf40 were reported as Grap2 ( 30 ) , and human Gads ( 31 ) and their mouse homo-logues , named Mona ( 32 ) and mouse Gads ( 33 ) , were also reported after the submission of this paper .
Although the report regarding human Gads showed similar results as our study , they did not show any comparative study between Gads and Grb2 .
We here show evidence suggesting that Grf40 plays a more critical role in the TCR -mediated signaling than Grb2 .
