Bertiner** Departments of * Pathology and * Medicine , University of California School of Medicine , Los Angeles , 90024-1732 Abstract We have previously shown that minimally oxidized LDL ( MM-LDL ) activated endothelial cells to increase their interaction with monocytes but not neutrophils , inducing monocyte but not neutrophil binding and synthesis of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and monocyte colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) .
In the present studies we have examined the signaling pathways by which this monocyte-specific response is induced .
Both induction of monocyte binding and mRNA levels for M-CSF by MM-LDL were not inhibited in protein kinase C-de-pleted endothelial cells .
A number of our studies indicate that cAMP is the second messenger for the effects of MM-LDL cited above .
Incubation of endothelial cells with MM-LDL caused a 173 % increase in intracellular cAMP levels .
Agents which increased cAMP levels , including cholera toxin , pertussis toxin , dibutyryl cAMP , and isoproterenol mimicked the actions of MM-LDL .
Agents which elevated cAMP were also shown to activate NFxB , suggesting a role for this transcription factor in activation of monocyte-endothelial interactions .
Although endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule ( ELAM ) mRNA synthesis can be regulated by NFxB , ELAM was not expressed and ELAM mRNA was only slightly elevated in response to MM-LDL .
We present evidence that induction of neutrophil binding by LPS is actually suppressed by agents that elevated cAMP levels .

Key words : atherosclerosis « MM-LDL + cAMP « inflammation « monocyte binding Introduction Activation of endothelial cells to synthesize binding molecules and chemotactic factors has been shown to elicit increased interaction with leukocytes ( 1-3 ) .
An important early event in the initiation of atherosclerosis is the increased interaction of monocytes with endothelial cells lining the vessel wall ( 4 ) .
In animals fed a high cholesterol diet , monocytes have been shown to bind more avidly to the endothelium , transmigrate through endothelial cell junctions , and enter the intimal space where they mature and form macrophages ( 5 ) .
These macrophages accumulate lipids and contribute to the formation of the fatty streak .

Our group has shown that treatment of endothelial cells with minimally oxidized ( modified ) LDL ( MM-LDL ) ' but not native LDL caused an increase in monocyte but not neutrophil binding and an increase in the production of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and monocyte colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) mRNA and protein ( 8-10 ) .
However no neutrophil chemotactic factor could be detected ( 11 ) .
In vivo studies showed that injection of MM-LDL but not highly oxidized LDL into mice induced increases in mRNA for MCP-1 and M-CSF ( 12 ) .
Increased levels of mRNA for MCP-1 and M-CSF have been found in human fatty streak lesions ( 13 , 14 ) .
MCP-1 is a highly active monocyte chemotactic factor ( 15 ) .
Proliferation and survival of monocytes and macrophages in the lesion may be supported by the local production of M-CSF ( 14 ) .
Among the inflammatory mediators that have been tested , including LPS , thrombin , IL-1 , and TNF ( 16-19 ) , MM-LDL is the only one shown to induce monocyte but not neutrophil interaction with the endothelium .
Understanding of the signaling molecules involved in the actions of MM-LDL is important since they also may be involved in other chronic inflammatory processes in vivo , characterized predominantly by monocytic infiltration .
To elucidate the mechanism of action of MM-LDL , we explored the signaling pathways by which it activates the endothelium .
Two major second messengers that have been extensively studied are protein kinase C ( PKC ) and cAMP .
The activation of both pathways in whole cells is mainly receptor mediated ( 20 , 21 ) .
PKC is a family of closely related proteins that differ in substrate specificity , co-factor dependency , and tissue distribution ( 21 ) .
It exists in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of cells and is generally activated in the presence of calcium and diacylglycerol .
Phorbol esters such as phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) are known to induce cellular responses by directly activating PKC ( 21 ) .
Agonist-induced cellular responses caused by PKC activation are down-regulated by pretreatment of cells with phorbol esters for 24-48 h ( 21 ) .
Regulation of the activity of adenylate cyclase and/or cAMP phosphodiesterase determines the levels of intracellular cAMP ( 20 ) and , consequently , the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) ( 22 ) .
The activity of adenylate cyclase is 1 .

MM-LDL~-induced Inflammatory Responses Are Mediated by cAMP __ ATA regulated by excitatory ( G , ) and inhibitory ( G ; ) G proteins ( 20 ) .
The role of G proteins in mediating cellular responses to stimulators has been extensively reviewed ( 23 , 24 ) .
Cholera toxin ( CT ) activates G , by ADP-ribosylating its alpha subunit , thus inhibiting its GTPase activity ( 25 ) .
Pertussis toxin ( PT ) has been shown to inhibit G ; by ADP-ribosylation and to po-tentiate the effect of the stimulatory arm of the adenylate cyclase system ( 25 ) .
Many physiological agonists act via cell surface receptors to alter adenylate cyclase activity ; isoproterenol ( IP ) , a beta adrenergic receptor agonist , has been shown to elevate cAMP levels in endothelial cells by activating G , ( 26 ) .
In addition , purified PKC and isolated preparations of adenylate cyclase have been shown to be activated by certain native and oxidized fatty acids as well as products of lipid peroxida-tion ( 27-29 ) , which may be present in MM-LDL .
Also it has been reported that alteration of membrane physical properties by changing its lipid composition affects adenylate cyclase activity ( 30 ) .
Activation of NF « B has been associated with gene expression in response to increased PKC or PK A activity ( 31 , 32 ) .
This transcription factor exists as a cytosolic dimer bound to an inhibitory molecule , I « B ( 33 ) .
Activation of NFkB leads to its dissociation from I « xB and its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to sequence-specific regulatory regions of several genes .
We examined the ability of MM-LDL to activate NFB which may be involved in transcriptional regulation of genes by MM-LDL .
Methods Cell preparation .
Rabbit aortic endothelial cells ( RAEC ) at passages 9-17 and human aortic endothelial cells ( 11 ) or human aortic valve cells ( kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Drake , UCLA School of Medi-cine ) at passages 4-7 were used .
For these studies , human monocytes were obtained by a modification of the Recalde method as described previously ( 8 ) .
The human neutrophil cell line HL60 ( American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ) was used as a source of neutrophil-like cells .
Leukocyte adhesion assay .
For adhesion studies , endothelial cells were cultured in gelatin-coated 48-well dishes , in DME containing 15 % calf serum ( CS ) , 5 ug/ml endothelial cell growth supplement ( ECGS ) , and 8 ug/ml heparin ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) .
When confluent monolayers were formed , medium was changed to DME containing 10 % CS without ECGS and heparin 24 h before the experi-ment .
This medium was then removed and agonists added to cells in DME with 5 % CS .
The gradual lowering of the serum concentration minimized the basal levels of leukocyte binding to the endothelial monolayer .
The concentration of LPS in medium containing each agonist was < 50 pg/ml as determined by chromogenic assay .
This level of LPS when present in LDL is ~ 50-fold less than required to induce monocyte binding ( data not shown ) .
After 4 h of incubation with agonists at 37°C , the endothelial monolayer was rinsed twice with DME containing 5 % CS and leukocytes were added at 10° cells per well .
After 20 min incubation at 37°C , the unbound leukocytes were removed and the cells were fixed with 1 % glutaraldehyde in PBS .
The number of bound leukocytes was determined by counting a minimum of six fields per well using light microscopy .
Lipoprotein preparation .
LDL was isolated by density gradient centrifugation of serum and stored in phosphate-buffered 0.15 M NaCl containing 0.01 % EDTA .
MM-LDL was made using a modification of the method by Sparrow et al .
( 34 ) using soybean lipoxygenase ( SLO ) and phospholipase A , ( PLA ; , ) ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) .
SLO and PLA , were separately bound to CNBr-activated sepharose beads ( Pharmacia Inc. , Piscata-way , NJ ) in coupling buffer ( 0.1 M NaHCO ; , 0.5 M NaCl , pH 8.3 ) .
Approximately 1,700 U of SLO and 4 U of PLA , were bound per mg of 472 _ Parhami , Fang , Fogelman , Andalibi , Territo , and Berliner beads .
LDL was used after dialysis against PBS to remove the EDTA .
0.5 mg of LDL in 1 ml of PBS was incubated at 4°C for 24 h with 20 U of PLA ; , , 5,000 U of SLO , and 1 mM CaCl ; in 12 x 75 mm sterile polypropylene snap cap tubes .
After 24 h , an additional 5,000 U of SLO was added and tubes were incubated another 24 h at 4°C .
Finally , the enzymes were removed by centrifugation , and butylated hydroxy-toluene and EDTA were added at 100 « M and 0.3 mM , respectively .
Preparations of MM-LDL used for these studies contained between 20 and 50 pg LPS/ml of medium .
This enzymatic modification of LDL has generated biologically active MM-LDL that has been stable for several months at 4°C .
Iron-oxidized LDL ( 12 , 35 ) , copper-oxidized LDL ( 36 , 37 ) , and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) -LDL ( 38 ) were made according to the previously published methods .
LDL was minimally oxidized by iron and highly oxidized by copper , giving 2 and 10 nmol of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances per mg of cholesterol after dialysis , respectively .
Northern analysis .
Endothelial cells were incubated at 37°C for 4 h with or without agonist in DME containing 5 % CS .
Total RNA was isolated from cells using guanidine thiocyanate/phenol method ( 39 ) .
10 ug of RNA was denatured at 65°C for 10 min in 2.2 M formaldehyde and 50 % deionized formamide and was electrophoresed through 1 % agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde .
RNA was transblotted to a nylon membrane ( Hybond-N ; Amersham Corp. , Arlington Heights , IL ) and cross-linked by ultraviolet light .
The blot was prehy-bridized at 65°C for 2 h in 0.15 M Na , HPO , , 0.25 M NaH , PO , , 1 mM EDTA , 7 % SDS , and 1 % BSA , pH 7.0 , and hybridized in the same buffer at 65°C overnight with P-labeled DNA probes for alpha tubulin , MCP-1 ( 9 ) , M-CSF ( 10 ) , or endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule ( ELAM ) ( kindly provided by Dr. Brian Seed , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) .
After hybridization , the blot was washed twice at room temperature in 2 % SSC/0.1 % SDS , and twice at 65°C in 0.5 % SSC/0.1 % SDS , for 20 min each , and exposed to x-ray film at -70°C .
The extent of induction was determined by densitometric scanning .
cAMP measurement .
For measuring cAMP levels , RAEC were cultured in 60-mm dishes and the cells were pretreated for 10 min with 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine ( IBMX , Calbiochem Corp. , La Jolla , CA ) , an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase , in DME containing 5 % CS .
Agonists were then added and cells collected at several time points after being rinsed twice with PBS containing 4 mM EDTA ( also an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase ) and scraped into the same buffer .
The cell pellet after centrifugation was resuspended in 100 l of boiling water containing 4 mM EDTA .
The suspension was sonicated , heated 3 min in a boiling water bath , and microcentrifuged for 2 min at high speed to spin out the coagulated proteins .
The supernatant was used to determine cAMP levels .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
RAEC were cultured in 100-mm dishes .
Approximately 10° cells were used per condition .
After treatment with agonist , the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold and scraped into ice-cold PBS .
The pellet was frozen in a dry ice/eth-anol bath and stored at -70°C .
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method described by Osborn et al .
( 40 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using 6 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel according to the protocol provided in NFkB DNA binding protein detection system from Gibco-Bethesda Research Laboratories ( Gaithersburg , MD ) .
The double-stranded oligonucleotide supplied is a 40 mer containing a tandem repeat of the consensus sequence for NFxB DNA binding site , -GGGGACTTTCC- .
To facilitate our studies , a new method of producing MM-LDL has been developed that is a modification of the procedure of Sparrow et al .
( 34 ) involving treatment of LDL with SLO and PLA ; .
This method has several advantages compared with our previous method of long-term storage at 4°C .
The new method takes several days as compared with 6-12 mo , and LDL from 20 consecutive donors treated in this manner yielded biologically active MM-LDL .
This enzymatic modification produced a low level of oxidation of LDL resulting in only a two- to threefold increase in conjugated dienes , an increase similar to that seen after cold storage .
Like LDL that was minimally oxidized by storage , LDL oxidized by lipoxygenase and PLA , caused an induction of monocyte but not neutrophil binding to RAEC treated for 4 h ( Fig .
1 ) .
In addition , such MM-LDL preparations induced the synthesis of mRNA for MCP-1 and M-CSF , whereas native LDL did not cause such induction ( Fig .
2 4 ) .
Characterization of second messengers .
We initially examined the role of PKC in mediating the effects of MM-LDL .
It has been reported that chronic incubation of cells with phorbol esters depletes the cellular content of PKCa and - $ , which have been shown to be the most prevalent forms in endothelial cells ( 41 ) .
Treatment of RAEC for 4 h with 10-40 nM PMA caused a strong induction of monocyte binding that was significantly down-regulated by a 48-h pretreatment with 10 nm PMA ( Fig .
3 4 ) .
This pretreatment did not down-regulate the binding induced by MM-LDL ( Fig .
3 4 ) but markedly down-regulated PKC activity in the pretreated cells ( data not shown ) .
Similarly , PMA pretreatment also did not inhibit the induction of mRNA levels for M-CSF by MM-LDL whereas induction by PMA was inhibited significantly ( Fig .
3 B ) .

After incubation , leukocyte adhesion assay was performed using human monocytes or a neutrophil-like cell line ( HL60 ) .
The data are representative of three out of three experiments and the values from a representative experiment are reported as the mean number of monocytes bound per high power field ( Xx100 ) +SEM ( n = 6 ) ( p < 0.001 for C vs. M , C vs. CT , C vs. PT , and C vs. cA in the monocyte binding assay ) .

lower than that induced by PMA , similar findings were obtained in three out of three experiments .
These results suggested that PKC is not the second messenger involved in mediating the induction of monocyte binding and increase of M-CSF mRNA by MM-LDL .
We investigated the role of cAMP in the MM-LDL-induced cellular responses .
Incubation of RAEC with MM-LDL resulted in a 40 and 173 % elevation of intracellular cAMP levels after 10 min and 2 h of treatment , respectively .
CT and PT both induced similar cellular responses as MM-LDL .
Incubation of RAEC with CT for 2 h and with PT for 1 h increased cAMP levels 100 and 200 % , respectively ( Table I ) .
Both CT and PT treatment of RAEC for 4 h caused a concentration-de-pendent induction of monocyte but not HL60 binding , with maximum responses at 400 ng/ml of CT and 30 ng/ml of PT ( Fig .
1 ) .
Both monocyte and HL60 binding were induced by LPS 10- and 20-fold , respectively ( Fig .
1 ) .
There was no additive effect of CT + MM-LDL ( p = 0.4579 , n = 6 ) or PT + MM-LDL ( p = 0.3307 , n = 6 ) compared with each toxin alone , even though maximal monocyte binding had not been obtained ( as seen in LPS-treated cells ) .
This lack of additivity suggests that MM-LDL , CT , and PT may act via similar signaling pathways .
The results from CT and PT studies strongly suggest the involvement of adenylate cyclase and intracellular cAMP levels in the specific induction of monocyte binding to endothelial cells .
Further evidence that increased cAMP levels are responsi-bie for the effects of MM-LDL on induction of monocyte binding was suggested by the fact that pretreatment of cells with 0.2 mM IBMX , a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor , for 10 min before MM-LDL treatment increased monocyte binding to MM-LDL-induced Inflammatory Responses Are Mediated by cAMP __ 478 ( 120 7 100 7 MONOS/HPF & { 3 10 ; ( 6 ) DENSITOMETRIC UNITS Po PIP Pio Figure 3 .

( 4 ) RAEC were incubated at 37°C for 4 h with no additives ( C ) , LPS 3 ng/ml ( L ) , MM-LDL 125 ug/ml ( Mf ) , or PMA 40 nM ( P ) .
In addition , to deplete the cellular content of PKC , cells were first pretreated with 10 nM PMA in DME containing 10 % CS for 48 h , indicated as ( P/ ) , followed by 4-h treatment with a second agonist as described above .
P/O indicates 48 h pretreatment with 10 nM PMA with no further treatments .
After this incubation , monocyte adhesion assay was performed as described in the legend of Fig .

Also treating RAEC for 4 h with 1 mM dbcAMP , which is known to be taken up by cells and leads to increased intracellular cAMP levels , induced monocyte binding sixfold but did not induce HL6O binding ( Fig .

In addition , treating RAEC for 1 h with 5 4M IP caused a 120 % increase in cAMP level , and a threefold induction of monocyte binding ( C = 15 vs. IP = 45 , p < 0.001 in a representative of three experiments ) .

Also reported is the ability of each agent to induce leukocyte binding after 4 h of treatment .
induced by IP .
A shorter incubation period with IP was used because of the relatively transient elevation of cAMP by this agonist .
Since it is believed that increased intracellular cAMP effects are mediated by PK A ( 22 ) , we tested the effect of H-8 , a PKA inhibitor , on the induction of monocyte binding by MM-LDL .
Initially , several concentrations of H-8 within the range reported by other investigators were used to test for inhibition of CT induction of monocyte binding .
H-8 at 60 LM inhibited induction of monocyte binding by CT by 50 % .
RAEC pretreated with H-8 at 60 or 100 aM for 1 h demonstrated an inhibition of MM-LDL-induced monocyte binding of 50 and 70 % , respectively , in a representative experiment ( p < 0.0001 for M vs. H-8 at both concentrations ; r = 10 ) .
The increased cAMP level observed after incubation of cells with MM-LDL produced by enzymatic modification was associated with the ability of this lipoprotein to induce monocyte but not HL60 binding .
Iron-oxidized LDL , which has similar effects to MM-LDL made enzymatically , also increased cAMP levels and monocyte but not HL60 binding ( Table I ) .
By contrast , incubation of RAEC for 2 h with MDA-LDL ( 125 ug/ml ) , copper-oxidized LDL ( highly oxidized , 125 ug/ml ) , or lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC , 100 aM ) decreased cAMP levels and did not induce either monocyte or HL60 binding ( Table 1 ) .
The possible involvement of cAMP elevation in the induction of mRNA for MCP-1 and M-CSF by MM-LDL was also tested .
Like MM-LDL , CT treatment of endothelial cells increased message for both MCP-1 and M-CSF twenty- and four-fold , respectively ( Fig .
2 B ) , as determined by densitometric scanning .
Incubation of RAEC with 1 mM dbcAMP for 4 h also caused a 10-fold increase in MCP-1 and a 3-fold increase in M-CSF mRNA levels as determined by densitometric scanning ( Fig .
2 C ) .
In addition , M-CSF mRNA level was elevated approximately twofold after 4 h of incubation with IP .
Treatment of RAEC for 4 h with the agents that lowered cAMP , including LPC ( shown in Table I ) , did not increase mRNA levels for M-CSF ( data not shown ) .
MM-LDL activates NFxB .
Previous reports have shown that NF « B activation in cytosolic extracts is at least partly mediated by phosphorylation of the NFxB/IxB complex by PK A ( 31 ) .
The ability of MM-LDL to activate NF « B was assessed by incubating RAEC with MM-LDL for 2 h and testing for enhanced NF « B binding to a labeled sequence-specific oligonucleotide in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
As shown in Fig .
4 A4 there was significant activation of NFxB by LPS and MM-LDL , but not by native LDL .
This experiment was performed with four different MM-LDL preparations , all of which gave similar results .
CT treatment of RAEC for 2 h also caused activation of NFxB ( Fig .
4 B ) .
Why neutrophil binding is not increased by MM-LDL .
ELAM is the major neutrophil-binding molecule on endothelial cell ( 42 ) .
Treatment of endothelial cells with MM-LDL did not increase surface expression of ELAM whereas LPS increased expression fourfold ( Fig .
5 4 ) .
MM-LDL in contrast to LPS caused only a minimal increase in ELAM mRNA levels , whereas both agents caused a major elevation of MCP-1 mRNA ( Fig .
5 B ) .

Duplicate lanes are shown for each condition .
such as CT. Incubation of RAEC with 3 ng/ml LPS for 4 h increased HL60 and monocyte binding to endothelial cells 13-and 9-fold , respectively ( Fig .

Incubation of endothelial cells with 400 ng/ml CT and 0.5 mM IBMX for 2 h followed by 4 h of incubation with 3 ng/ml LPS significantly inhibited the induction of HL60 but not monocyte binding by LPS ( Fig .

Such inhibition of the induction of HL60 and not monocyte binding by LPS was also seen after pretreatment of endothelial cells with MM-LDL ( Fig .

Discussion Exposure of endothelial cells to MM-LDL leads to increased monocyte but not neutrophil binding ( Fig .
1 ) and mRNA levels for MCP-1 and M-CSF ( Fig .
2 A ) .
Since the pattern of leukocyte binding and mRNA induction by MM-LDL is distinct from that of other inflammatory agents , we suspected the signaling pathways might be different .
A number of studies have concluded that PKC plays a role in the signal transduction pathways initiated by thrombin , TNF-a , IL-1 , and LPS ( 9 , 16 ) .
PMA pretreatment of endothelial cells , which has been shown to deplete the cellular content of PKC ( 43 ) , down-regulated the monocyte binding induced by PMA ( Fig .
3 4 ) but did not inhibit the MM-LDL-induced monocyte binding or the MM-LDL-mediated increase in M-CSF mRNA ( Fig .

Furthermore , it has been previously shown that , in fibroblasts , the increase of mRNA levels for JE , the murine homologue of MCP-1 gene ( 44 ) , by MM-LDL is PKC independent .
Another second messenger that mediates agonist-induced cellular responses is cAMP .
It has been reported that cAMP levels mediate endothelial barrier properties ( 45 ) , as well as endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to thrombin , serotonin , and UK14304 ( a selective a ; -adrenergic receptor agonist ) ( 46 ) .
Of relevance to the present report is the observation by Sung et al .
( 26 ) that CT treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to endothelial cells .
In this report we present data strongly suggesting that the effects of MM-LDL prepared by enzymatic modification or mild iron oxidation are mediated by cAMP .
We have shown that incubation of endothelial cells with MM-LDL increased the levels of intracellular cAMP ( Table I ) .
The responses induced by CT and PT , both of which caused elevation of cAMP levels ( Table 1 ) , and dbcAMP itself were similar to those induced by MM-LDL .
These responses included increased monocyte but not HL60 binding ( Fig .
1 ) , and increased levels of mRNA for MCP-1 and M-CSF ( Fig .
2 ) .
There was no additive effect of MM-LDL plus CT or PT , which suggests that these agents may act via the same mechanism as MM-LDL .
Furthermore , IP elevated cAMP levels in endothelial cells , increased monocyte but not HL6O0 binding , and increased M-CSF mRNA level .
Native LDL , MDA-LDL , highly oxidized LDL , and LPC did not increase cAMP levels and did not induce the cellular responses to MM-LDL reported in the present study .
The results of our studies give some insight into the possible mechanisms by which MM-LDL increases cAMP .
The fact that both CT and PT mimic the effects of MM-LDL suggests that the regulation of cAMP concentration by MM-LDL may A476 - Parhami , Fang , Fogelman , Andalibi , Territo , and Berliner be at the level of G , or G ; proteins .
A significant level of G ; has been detected in endothelial cells ( 47 ) .
The fact that in these cells PT increased cAMP levels suggests that perhaps under normal conditions an active population of G ; proteins may regulate adenylate cyclase activity in aortic endothelial cells , as well as the expression of monocyte-binding molecules , MCP-1 , and M-CSF .
The inhibition of G ; , by PT would alleviate its negative effect , thus leading to an increase in cAMP levels .
We are currently in the process of characterizing the active lipid component ( s ) of MM-LDL .
Our studies have shown that neutral lipids ( including oxidized fatty acids ) ( 8 ) and LPC ( current study ) are not responsible for the effects of MM-LDL on endothelial cells after 4 h of treatment .
Our past and ongoing studies suggest that the active lipid responsible for the effects seen at 4 h is an oxidized phospholipid ( 8 ) .
Previous reports showed that treatment of RAEC with levels of LPC used by us caused only a modest ( 1.4-fold ) increase in monocyte binding ( compared with the 4-10-fold induction seen with MM-LDL ) and that the major effect of LPC was seen after 24 h ( 48 ) .
Our previous studies have shown that effects of MM-LDL may continue to act up to 48 h ( 8 ) , and it is clearly possible that different lipids , such as LPC , or lipoxygenase prod-ucts , such as oxidized fatty acids , as reported by others to be active in monocytes ( 49 ) , may be responsible for the prolonged activation .
Since an NFxB binding site is present in the promoter region of JE ( 50 ) and M-CSF genes ( 50a ) , and cAMP has been suggested to play a role in NFx « B activation ( 51 ) , we suspected that NFxB may also be associated with MM-LDL regulation of gene transcription .
Our results indicate that treatment of endothelial cells with MM-LDL or CT causes activation of NF « B , whereas native LDL does not lead to such activation ( Fig .
4 , 4 and B ) .
This suggests that NFB activation is associated with the induction of cellular responses to increased intracellular cAMP levels .
Our investigations have shown , however , that not all genes with NFxB binding site in their promoter region are induced by MM-LDL ; mRNA levels of ELAM ( 52 ) were only minimally induced ( Fig .
5 B ) .
We have further shown that increased cAMP levels induced by MM-LDL or CT inhibited the induction of neutrophil and not monocyte binding by LPS ( Fig .
6 ) .
Similarly , dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin suppression of LPS-induced TNF-a gene expression has been previously reported ( 53 ) .
Pober et al .
( 54 ) reported that increased cAMP levels in forskolin-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells inhibited TNF-induced ELAM expression .
Our results also support the observation by Montgomery et al .
( 55 ) that NFxB is associated with but is not sufficient for ELAM message induction .
We suggest that the MM-LDL-induced increase in cAMP levels inhibits ELAM expression .
It is evident from our observations that the increased monocyte binding induced by MM-LDL is independent of ELAM since MM-LDL did not increase ELAM expression ( Fig .
5 4 ) .
We have also ruled out VCAM and ICAM in contributing to the increased monocyte binding seen after 4 h incubation of endothelial cells with MM-LDL ( 56 ) .
We suggest that MM-LDL up-regulates another monocyte binding molecule , the expression of which is mediated via a cAMP-dependent pathway .
Further characterization of this binding molecule is the subject of separate studies .
We propose that cellular responses to MM-LDL and perhaps to other inducers of chronic inflammatory responses characterized by inducing monocyte but not neutrophil infil- tration are regulated by cAMP .
In fatty streak lesions , MM-LDL may induce monocyte infiltration by increasing cAMP .
It is also possible that physiological agonists of beta adrenergic receptors ( i.e .
, epinephrine and norepinephrine ) may contribute to monocyte infiltration in atherogenesis and perhaps to other inflammatory processes .
We propose that the second mes-senger , cAMP , activates NFxB , and perhaps other transcription factors , and may inhibit transcription of genes such as ELAM , which would otherwise promote neutrophil binding .
