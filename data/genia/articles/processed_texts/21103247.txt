Ana L. Mora , * Jeehee Youn , `` * Achsah D. Keegan , `` and Mark Boothby®* Proliferative responses of lymphoid cells to IL-2 and IL-4 depend on activation of the cells , but the mechanism ( s ) by which activation enhances cellular competence to respond to cytokines is not fully understood .
The NF-B/Rel family represents one signal transduction pathway induced during such activation .
We show in this study that inhibition of NF-B through the expression of an IxBa ( inhibitory protein that dissociates from NF-B ) mutant refractory to signal-induced degradation ( IxBa ( AN ) ) interfered with the acquisition of competence to proliferate in response to IL-4 as well as IL-2 .
Thymocytes and T cells from IrxBa ( AN ) transgenic mice expressed normal levels of IL-2R subunits .
However , transgenic cells exhibited a dramatic defect in Stat5A activation treatment with IL-2 , and a similar defect was observed for IL-4-induced Stat5 .
In contrast , T lymphoid cells with inhibition of NF-xB showed normal insulin receptor substrate-2 phosphorylation and only a modest decrease in Stat6 activation and insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation after IL-4 stimulation .
These results indicate that the NF- « B/Rel/IxBa system can regulate cytokine receptor capacitation through effects on the induction of downstream signaling by the Stat transcription factor family .
The Journal of Immunology , 2001 , 166 : 2218-2227. ytokines regulate functions in lymphoid cells that include proliferation , survival , and differentiation ( 1 , 2 ) .
Certain responses of lymphocytes to cytokines require a cellular state of competence that is acquired only after T cell activation .
However , the molecular mechanisms that lead to this enhanced responsiveness are not fully understood .
Cells may not respond to IL-2 , a growth factor for activated T cells , unless first activated so that the IL-2Ra-chain is expressed ( 3-5 ) .
After expression of the full high-affinity IL-2R triggered by engagement of the TCR , IL-2 can drive responding cells through the cell cycle , inducing T cell proliferation in an autocrine fashion ( 4 , 5 ) .
Similarly , activation-induced increases in IL-4Ra-chains may be required to achieve sufficient IL-4 signaling or participate in growth regulation ( 6-11 ) .
In contrast to these examples of receptor induction as a basis for competence , it is possible that the competence of a cytokine receptor to transduce signals may be regulated .
For instance , the expression of IL-2R may not be sufficient for maximal proliferation in response to IL-2 ( 5 , 12-15 ) , and there may be circumstances under which T cells expressing IL-4R may fail to activate certain signaling events normally ( 16-18 ) .

l transcription factor family ( 19 , 20 ) .
Regulation of NF- « B/Rel proteins is tightly controlled by inhibitory proteins , which include inhibitory protein that dissociates from NF- « B ( IxBa ) .
* The noncovalent association of NF- « B/Rel dimers with these inhibitory molecules prevents nuclear translocation of the NF-KB proteins in lymphocytes .
During normal T cell activation , IxBa is subject to sequence-specific phosphorylation and ubiquitination leading to IxBa degradation and the nuclear import of NF-KB ( 19 , 20 ) .
We have developed transgenic ( Tg ) mice whose T lineage expresses IxBa ( AN ) , an IxBa mutant that is refractory to signal-induced degradation ( 21 , 22 ) .
The resultant inhibition of the NF- « B/Rel signaling pathway was associated with a T cell proliferative defect refractory to the addition of exogenous IL-2 ( 21 ) .
Consistent with this phenotype , T cells lacking the individual subunit RelA ( p65 ) exhibited an impaired proliferative response to various mitogens despite normal production of IL-2 and expression of IL-2Ra ( 23 ) .
Taken together , these data suggested NF- « B/Rel involvement in regulation of the competence to generate proliferative responses following the engagement of the IL-2R .
The requirement for induction of competence applies to cytokines in addition to IL-2 .
For instance , IL-4 is a cytokine that can promote the survival , proliferation , and differentiation of T lymphocytes ( 6 , 7 , 24 , 25 ) .
To investigate whether the involvement of NF- « B/Re !
proteins in lymphokine-responsive proliferation of T lineage cells extends to a different T cell growth factor , we have measured the responses to IL-4 of cells derived from IxBa ( AN ) Tg mice and investigated mechanisms for altered IL-2- and IL-4-dependent proliferation to determine whether there are any lympho-kine-specific differences underlying the hyporesponsiveness to these cytokines .

In selected experiments , these mice were crossed with mice in which the Ick proximal promoter alone leads to T cell-specific expression of a transgene encoding a chimeric cytokine receptor in which the mouse extracellular and transmem-brane domains are fused to a mouse IL-4Ra cytoplasmic tail ( 26 ) .
All mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions using microisolator cages and were used at 6-8 wk of age in accordance with the federal and state government regulations after institutional approval .
Cell preparations Single cell suspensions were prepared from thymus , spleen , and lymph nodes by crushing the organs in complete media ( RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FBS , 2 mM 1-glutamine , and 0.1 % penicillin-strepto-mycin ) , followed by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes .
Splenic and lymph node T lymphocytes were depleted of B cells by chromatography through nylon wool columns , as described previously ( 21 ) .
Briefly , single cell suspensions from pooled spleen and lymph nodes were loaded onto nylon wool columns preequlibrated with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 % FBS at 37°C .
After 45 min at 37°C , the nonadherent cells were eluted from the columns .
The resultant population was < 10 % B220+* and 75-90 % T cells , as determined by flow cytometry .
Proliferation assays Thymocyte suspensions were counted and plated ( 5 X 10° cells per 100 ul of media ) in microtiter wells .
Triplicate samples were cultured for 48 h at 37°C in the presence of PMA ( 50 ng/m ! )
, ionomycin ( 1 pg/ml ) , IL-2 ( 10 ng/ml ) , IL-4 ( 10 ng/ml1 ) , IL-12 ( 10 ng/ml ) , PMA and IL-4 , PMA and IL-2 , PMA and IL-12 , or PMA and ionomycin , as indicated .
Tritiated thymidine ( 1 uCi in 100 pl of media ) was added to each well for the final 8 h before determination of radioisotope incorporation into DNA .
T lymphocyte preparations from spleen and lymph node , depleted of B cells as described above , were plated in microtiter wells previously incubated overnight with PBS or anti-CD3 mAb ( 10 ug/ml , clone 2C11 ; PharMingen ) , as indicated .
Triplicate samples were then cultured ( 48 h at 37°C ) in the presence of IL-2 , IL-4 , an activating mAb against CD28 ( 10 pg/ml , clone 37.51 ; PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) , anti-CD28 and IL-2 , or anti-€CD28 and IL-4 , or as for thymocytes , as indicated ; DNA synthesis was then quantified as above .
Gel mobility shift analyses Total cell extracts were prepared from single cell suspensions of thymocytes or T cells using high-salt extraction in the presence of protease in-hibitors , as previously described ( 21 , 22 ) .
These extracts were then used for gel mobility shift assays of NF-B/Re !
proteins ( 21 ) .
The probe used was a double-stranded P-labeled oligonucleotide modified from a « B enhancer sequence in the IL-2Ra promoter ( « B-pd ) ( 5-CAACGGCAGGG GAATTCCCCTCTCCTT-3 ' ) .
DNA-binding reaction mixtures ( 20 1 ) contained 5 ug of nuclear extract , 2 ug double-stranded poly ( dI-dC ) , and 10 ug BSA buffered in 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 5 % glycerol , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , and 5 mM DTT .
Nucleoprotein complexes were then resolved on a native 5 % polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography .
For detection of Stat5- and Stat6-binding activities , thymocytes or B cell-depleted T lymphocytes were cultured overnight at 37°C in the presence of PMA and ionomycin , or plate-bound anti-CD3 ( 10 ug/ml ) and anti-CD28 ( 2.5 pg/ml ) , respectively .
These cells were then rinsed once with RPMI medium without serum , cultured 1 h at 37°C in serum-free media , treated for 30 min with IL-2 , IL-4 , or medium alone , and then lysed in 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 50 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 8 ) , 0.1 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 100 mM Na , ; VO , , 50 mM NaF , 1 mM DTT , 0.4 mM PMSF , 3 mg/ml aprotinin , 1 pg/ml leupeptin , and 10 % glycerol .
Lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 15,000 % g for 5 min .
For the EMSA , cell extracts ( 5 ug of total protein ) were incubated with 1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) for 30 min with P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing Stat binding sites , then resolved by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 4.5 % PAGE .
The probes used contained a consensus binding site for Stat5 ( upper strand , 5-AGATITCTAGGAATTCAATCC 3 ' ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) or a Stat6 binding site from the mouse germline epsilon Ig heavy chain promoter ( 5-AACTTC CCAAGAACAGA-3 `` ) ( 27 , 28 ) .
Flow cytometric analysis Single cell suspensions of thymocytes treated overnight with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) , ionomycin ( 1 pg/m ! )
, or T cells from spleen and lymph node treated with anti-CD3 ( 10 pg/ml ! )
and anti-CD28 ( 2.5 pg/ml ) were incu- 2219 bated with fluorochrome-conjugated or biotinylated Abs ( PharMingen ) against IL-2Ra/CD25 ( FITC ) , y-chain ( biotin ) , IL-2RB/CD122 , or IL-4Ra ( biotin ) at 4°C , as described ( 20 ) .
CD122 was detected by a three-step staining , including biotinylated goat anti-rat Ig and streptavidin-PE ( PharMingen ) .
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting Whole cell extracts obtained from thymocytes and T cells ( pooled splenic and lymph node cells ) were prepared as described above .
These extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with antisera against Stat5A , Stat5B ( Zymed Laboratories , San Francisco , CA ) , insulin receptor substrate-1 ( IRS-1 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and IRS-2 ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) .
The precipitates were washed in lysis buffer , solubilized in SDS sample buffer , resolved on 7.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels , and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes .
The membranes were probed in accordance with manufacturer 's protocols using mAbs against phosphotyrosine ( RC-20 ; Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY ; and 4G10 ; Upstate Biotechnology ) , StatSA , Stat5B , IRS-1 , or IRS-2 , as indicated .
After rinsing with PBS-0.1 % Tween , bound Abs were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence and secondary Abs , where indicated ( NEN , Dupont , Boston , MA ) .
Isolation and analysis of RNA Suspensions of thymocytes and B cell-depleted T cells were plated ( 2.5 X 10° cells/ml ) and cultured overnight at 37°C in the presence of PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) , ionomycin ( 1 pg/ml ) , IL-4 ( 10 ng/m !
1 ) , PMA and IL-4 , or PMA and ionomycin for thymocytes , or with IL-4 and anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for T cells .
Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Life Technologies , Bethesda , MD ) .
After resolving RNAs by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-agarose gels , nucleic acids were transferred to Nylon membranes ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) , fixed by UV cross-linking , then probed using cDNAs labeled by random hexamer priming and hybridization in 50 % formamide , 0.2 % SDS , 0.6 M NaCl , 4X Denhardt 's , 50 ug/ml sheared , denatured salmon sperm DNA , and 5 % dextran sulfate at 42°C .
The filters were washed in 2X SSC , 0.1 % SDS at room temperature , then in 0.5 % SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 60°C .
Equal loading of RNAs was verified by ethidium bromide staining and by hybridization with a rRNA oligonucleotide probe ( 29 ) .
Band intensities were quantified using a Fuji BAS 1000 phosphor imager .
Results Role of NF- « B signaling in IL-4-dependent proliferation of T lymphoid cells We previously reported that thymocytes and T cells from mice expressing a constitutive repressor of NF- « B/Rel signaling ( IxBa ( AN ) ) proliferated poorly after mitogenic stimuli , and that addition of exogenous IL-2 did not reverse this abnormality ( 21 ) .
These data were interpreted as indicating the presence of a defect refractory to IL-2 , but it was unclear whether receptor expression was diminished or whether activation of specific signaling pathways downstream from the IL-2R was affected by the inhibition of NF-kB .
As outlined above , it seemed possible that the findings were due to an inability of activating signals to create a state of competence .
To determine whether NF- « B/Rel !
l signaling is required for responses of T lymphoid cells to any other lymphokine , we measured proliferative responses to IL-4 using thymocytes and T cells derived from IxBa ( AN ) Tg mice and their wild-type lit-termates ( nontransgenic ( NTg ) mice ) .
The proliferative response to IL-4 of PMA-treated thymocytes from IxBa ( AN ) Tg mice was one-tenth that of control cells ( Fig .
14 ) .
A similar proliferative defect was observed using cells cultured in PMA and IL-2 , compared with the 4-fold difference between NTg and Tg samples stimulated by PMA and ionomycin ( 21 ) ( Fig .
14 legend ) .
As ex-pected , thymocytes did not proliferate appreciably when treated with PMA , IL-2 , or IL-4 alone .
These data indicate that PMA was required to induce thymocyte competence to proliferate in response to IL-2 or IL-4 , and that NF- « B/Re !
signaling was essential for induction of this competent state .
To determine whether a similar requirement applies to mature T cells , proliferative responses to IL-2 and IL-4 were measured using 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 2220 NF- « B AND LYMPHOKINE-DEPENDENT PROLIFERATION OF T LYMPHOID CELLS A Thymus 304 204 § % 101 & _ o g ?

Cells were pulsed for an additional 8 h with tritiated thymidine and harvested for scintillation counting .
The results are shown as the mean tritiated thymidine incorporation in three independent experiments with pooled thymocytes from six NTg and eight Tg mice in each experiment .
Thymidine incorporation into these pooled thymocytes treated was 21,521 cpm ( Tg ) compared with 91,947 cpm ( NTg ) when treated with PMA and ionomycin .

DNA-protein complexes were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography .
+ B cell-depleted T lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs .
Lymphokine-dependent proliferation of IkBa ( AN ) cells stimulated with PMA was again observed to be reduced by an order of magnitude ( Fig .
1B ) .
T cell activation by anti-CD3 depends on IL-2 production and responsiveness .
IxBa ( AN ) T cells exhibited a proliferative defect refractory to IL-4 as well as IL-2 after activation with anti-CD3 ( Fig .
1B ) , although the magnitude of the deficit was less dramatic .
Costimulatory signaling by CD28 has been described as critical for the enhancement of T cell proliferation ( 30 ) .
To determine whether the observed decrease in proliferation was due to inadequate costimulation in these cultures and if signaling through the CD28 receptor could reverse the impairment of cyto-kine-dependent proliferation , we added an activating Ab against CD28 to the anti-CD3 stimulus .
However , the presence of agonist Abs against CD28 did not reverse the failure of cells to proliferate normally in IL-2 or IL-4 ( Fig .
1B ) .
We have previously shown that induction of NF- « B under biochemical conditions different from these ( i.e .
, by anti-CD3/28 or by PMA plus ionomycin ) is potently inhibited by the IxBa ( AN ) transgene ( 21 , 31 ) , but had not assayed PMA alone .
To determine the effect of IxBa ( AN ) on the nuclear induction of NF- « B/Re !
during PMA treatment , mobility shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts derived from NTg and Tg mice .
These experiments demonstrated that PMA treatment alone was sufficient to induce high nuclear levels of NF-KB activity in cells from wild-type animals , but not Tg mice ( Fig .
1C ) .
We conclude that T cell competence to proliferate in response to both growth signals , IL-2 and IL-4 , depends on normal NF- « B signaling .
Selective decreases in IL-4-induced gene expression It has been proposed that growth regulation and differentiation/ regulation of gene expression represent mechanistically distinct effects of IL-2 and IL-4 signaling that are dependent on different portions of the cytokine receptors and different signaling pathways ( 32 , 33 ) .
IL-4 does not activate NF- « B , but the finding that one downstream effect of cytokine receptor signaling , proliferation , was diminished in lymphoid cells whose NF- « B/Rel signaling is inhibited prompted us to investigate whether IL-4 induction of target gene transcription was normal .
Few genes have been identified whose expression is IL-4 dependent in T cells , but IL-4 does increase IL-4Ra-chain expression ( 8 ) and transcription of the mouse IL-2RB-chain gene ( 34 ) .
Therefore , we performed Northern blot analyses to analyze the effect of IxBa ( AN ) on this measure of IL-4 signaling .
Levels of IL-4Ra and IL-2RB mRNA were substantially diminished ( 0.3 X control ) in cells from IxBa ( AN ) mice after IL-4 stimulation ( Fig .
2 ) .
We have observed a decrease in c-myc mRNA in Tg T cells after activation by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 ( unpublished observations ) , perhaps reflecting the presence of « B-binding sites in the c-myc promoter ( 35 ) .
Since this proto-oncogene promoter is a target of IL-4-mediated signaling that may be independent of the IL-4-inducible transcription factor Stat6 in a nonlymphoid cell line ( 36 ) , we investigated the levels of c-myc mRNA expression .
As shown in Fig .
2 , levels of c-mye mRNA expression observed before and after IL-4 stimulation of Tg T cells were little different from those of wild-type controls .
Thus , the inhibitory effects of IxBa ( AN ) on IL-4 signaling pathways include decreased expression of selected target genes , including a key signaling subunit of the IL-4R .
Activation of IL-4 signal transduction pathways in IxBa ( AN ) Tg mice The IL-4Ra cytoplasmic tail lacks intrinsic tyrosine or serine/thre-onine kinase activity , but upon ligand binding , resident Janus tyrosine kinases ( Jak ) become activated ( 37 , 38 ) .
These kinases are thought to induce phosphorylation of downstream substrates , which include conserved tyrosine residues in the IL-4Ra tail , IRS proteins IRS-1/2 , and the IL-4-associated Stat6 ( 37-39 ) .
Recruitment of the IRS proteins to IL-4Ra « in particular has been implicated as an essential step in IL-4-induced proliferation of certain cell lines ( 39-41 ) .
Thus , engagement of the IL-4 ( but not IL-2 ) receptor activates a signaling pathway in which recruitment of IRS-1 and -2 to a distinct tyrosine-phosphorylated residue in IL4Ra leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRS proteins in cell lines , followed by recruitment of downstream signal 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology A Thymus T cells W.T .

Northern blot analysis was performed on RNAs derived from cultured lymphoid cells of Tg mice and littermate controls ( WT ) .
Thymocytes , or B cell-depleted T cell preparations , as indicated , were cultured in media with IL-4 ( 10 ng/ ml ) , or without exogenous cytokine , as indicated .
Samples of total cellular RNA ( 10 ug ) were fractionated under denaturing conditions on formaldehyde-agarose gels , transferred to nylon membranes , and sequentially hybridized with radiolabeled IL-4R « , IL-2R $ , and c-myc cDNA probes , then with an rRNA probe .

transducers ( 37 , 42 ) .
IRS proteins are indispensible for IL-4-induced mitogenesis in the hemopoietic cell line 32D , and thus a defect in IRS activation might lead to decreased IL-4-dependent proliferation of lymphoid cells ( 40 , 41 ) .
To investigate whether IRS activation is altered in IxBa ( AN ) Tg cells compared with normal primary cells , we performed immunoprecipitations of IRS-1 or IRS-2 , followed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting analyses ( Fig .
3 ) .
When thymocytes were first activated , rinsed , and then stimulated , we discovered that the preactivation step induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 independent of the addition of exogenous IL-4 ( panel A ) .
The amount of tyrosine phosphorylation in IxBa ( AN ) Tg cells was normal .
To investigate 2221 further whether the inhibition of NF- « B affected the ability of IL-4 to influence the IRS-2 pathway , responses to IL-4 were tested in cells that had not undergone preactivation ( B ) .
Under these con-ditions , the primary cells demonstrated IL-4-dependent increases in IRS-2 phosphorylation that could not be mimicked by IL-2 and were unaffected by IxBa ( AN ) .
Short-term IL-4 treatment induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in resting cells ( not shown ) and those that had been preactivated ( C ) .
In contrast to the results with IRS-2 , the magnitude of IL-4-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation was moderately reduced in Tg cells compared with wild-type prep-arations .
Inasmuch as control immunoblots revealed similar levels of IRS proteins in wild-type and Tg cells ( Fig .
3 ) , we conclude that the inhibition of NF- « B by IxBa ( AN ) led to a diminution in the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 , but not IRS-2 in response to IL-4 .
Since IRS-2 appears be the predominant IRS protein in primary T lymphoid cells rather than IRS-1 ( 43 ) , the degree of inhibition selective for IRS-1 seemed unlikely to explain fully the more substantial impairment of proliferation .
In addition to IRS recruitment and activation , members of the Stat transcription factor family are induced by IL-4 treatment of activated T cells ( 37 , 38 , 44 ) .
Following IL-4-induced phosphorylation , cytosolic Staté proteins dimerize , translocate to the nu-cleus , and bind to consensus sequences in the promoter regions of IL-4-regulated genes .
Stat6 activation represents a key pathway for IL-4-induced gene induction and differentiation ( 10 , 11 , 45 ) , but it has been suggested that Stat6 also may contribute to the regulation of T cell proliferation by IL-4 ( 46 ) .
To determine the effect of IxBa ( AN ) on this IL-4 signaling pathway , we compared Staté-binding activity in thymocytes and T cells from NTg and Tg mice .
As shown in Fig .
4 , induction of nuclear Stat6 was 2-fold higher in wild-type cells as compared with IxBa ( AN ) -expressing cells .
mRNA levels for IL-4Ra were substantially decreased due to defective NF- « B/Re !
signaling ( Fig .
2 ) , and this inhibitory effect was also observed at the cell surface ( see below ) .
Stat6 activation depends on the availability of IL-4Ra-associated phosphotyrosine residues in the cytoplasm ( 32 , 44 ) , so we infer that there is no apparent decrease in the biochemical efficiency of Stat6 activation per IL-4R molecule when the net induction of this transcription factor in the nucleus was diminished to a modest extent .
In addition to the activation of Stat6 by IL-4 , more recent work has established that IL-4 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat5 isoforms A and B in activated T cells , followed by increased expression of Stat5-dependent reporters ( 47 , 48 ) .

IL-4 induction of Staté- and Stat5-binding activity in IxkBa ( AN ) T cells .

B cell-depleted lymphoid cells ( T cells ) from spleen and lymph nodes of wild-type and Tg mice were activated and stimulated with IL-4 , as is described in A .
Whole cell extracts were then assayed for Stat5 by mobility shift analyses using an oligonucleotide probe that contains a Stat5 consensus sequence .
The identity of the indicated complexes was confirmed by supershift analyses using antiserum specific for StatS5 ( A/B ) ( black dot ) .
Similar results were obtained with thymocytes .
a key link between the IL-4R and a proliferative response to this cytokine ( 48-50 ) .
We therefore assayed Stat5 induction after IL-4 treatment of activated cells from wild-type and IxBa ( AN ) mice ( Fig .
4C ) .
In contrast to the relatively modest effect on IRS proteins and Stat6 , Stat5 induction was greatly diminished in cells from the Tg mice as compared with controls .
We conclude that interference with the NF- « B/Rel pathway led to a preferential inhibition of Stat5 induction as compared with Stat6 .
IL-4R expression The IL-4R consists of an IL-4Ra-chain , which heterodimerizes with a second subunit , the common y-chain ( y , ) , which is shared with the receptors for IL-2 and other members of the hemopoietin receptor superfamily ( 37 , 51-53 ) .
Importantly , loss-of-function mutants and Ab-blocking studies indicate that y , plays a critical role in IL-4-induced proliferation ( 52 , 53 ) , and the induction of Stat5 by IL-4 in activated T cells appears to be due to interactions with Jak3 that is noncovalently associated with y , rather than IL4Ra ( 47 , 48 ) .
To investigate further how IxBa ( AN ) leads to diminished responses to IL-4 , we measured the cell surface expression of IL-4R a and y , subunits .
We observed a substantial reduction in IL-4Ra « expression on Tg thymocytes and T cell lymphocytes compared with wild-type counterparts that had been ren- dered competent to proliferate ( Fig .
5 ) .
In contrast , expression of the y , subunit was normal .
These data indicate that NF- « B/Rel proteins serve a regulatory role in the expression of IL-4R « .
Mor-ever , decreased IL-4-induced proliferation correlated with a diminution in IL-4 signaling reflected most by Stat5 activation , and to a lesser extent by IRS-1 phosphorylation and Stat6 induction .
In transfected B lymphoma cells , the activation of some signaling pathways by IL-4 was influenced by the number of receptors expressed ( 33 ) .
Therefore , we explored whether a decreased pool of available IL-4Ra cytoplasmic tails in these primary cells is the mechanistic basis for the observed diminution in IL-4-induced proliferation .
To do so , we sought to increase the pool of IL-4Ra tails by an approach independent of prior activation .
We had previously characterized Tg mice in which the T lineage specifically expresses a chimera of mouse IL-2R $ and the IL-4Ra cytoplasmic tail ( 26 ) .
Both thymocytes and T cells from these mice demonstrated inducibility of Stat6 by IL-2 and other evidence that these cytoplasmic tails functioned in an IL-4-specific manner ( 26 ) .
Accordingly , we crossed chimeric cytokine receptor Tg mice with those expressing the inhibitor of NF-KB signaling and performed proliferation assays measuring the response to IL-2 , IL-4 , or a combination of these cytokines ( Fig .
6 ) .
Strikingly , under no condition ( IL-4 alone or IL-2 with IL-4 ) did the increased pool of IL-4Ra cytoplasmic tails in double-Tg mice promote an enhancement of proliferation above that obtained with IxBa { ( AN ) sin-gle-Tg animals .
These data suggest that a limiting pool of cytoplasmic tails is not the sole basis for a decreased response to IL-4 .
Defective StatSA activation in IxBa { ( AN ) T cells despite IL-2R expression The functional IL-2R in mice is composed of three subunits : IL-2Ra , IL-2R $ , and the y , , ( 4 , 5 ) .

Activated thymocytes ( PMA plus ionomycin ) and T cells ( anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ) from Tg mice and their NTg litter-mates were stained with mAbs specific for IL-2R « ( CD25 ) , IL-2RB ( CD122 ) , y , , IL-4Ra , CD3 , and TCRaB , and then analyzed by flow cytometry .
The expression of the indicated surface molecules on wild-type and Tg mice was assessed by gating on TCRaRB® thymocytes ( 4 ) or on CD3 * T cells ( B ) and then displaying the indicated histograms .
Solid lines indicate specific staining , while dashed lines ( -- ) show the relevant control histogram .
Of note , production of IL-2 by anti-CD3/28-activated IxBa ( AN ) T cells is essentially normal ( 31 ) so that differences in receptor internalization are unlikely to contribute to the similarity of receptor expression on wild-type and Tg T cells .
Minor variability leading to the apparent presence of or y , `` `` ® `` subpopulations is unlikely to account for differences in proliferation in light of the high frequency of T cells that undergo blast transformation under identical conditions ( 31 ) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-labeling indices of 12-17 % /h for wild-type CD4 and CD8 T cells ( A. L. Mora and M. Boothby , unpublished observations ) .

Failure of increased IL-4Ra cytoplasmic tails to enhance proliferation of IxBa ( AN ) cells .
IxBa ( AN ) Tg mice were crossed with a Tg mice encoding a chimeric IL-2/IL-4 receptor to the T lineage ( chimeric ( Chi ) IL-2/4R ) ( 26 ) .
B cell-depleted T cells were prepared from pooled lymph nodes and spleens from wild-type , Chi IL-2/4R , IxBa ( AN ) , and Chi IL-2/4R X IxBa ( AN ) double-Tg littermate mice .
Cell preparations were stimulated for 48 h , as indicated , using plate-bound anti-CD3 ( 10 ug/m1 ) , agonistic Abs against CD28 ( 10 pg/ml ) , or PMA ( 50 ng/m ! )
, each in the presence of IL-2 ( 10 ng/m ! )
or IL-4 ( 10 ng/ml ) .
Cells were pulsed for an additional 8 h with tritiated thymidine and harvested for scintillation counting .
The results are shown as the mean ( +*SEM ) of the stimulation indexes in four independent experiments .
Stimulation index was calculated as the mean cpm stimulated [ °H ] thymidine incorporation divided by the arithmetic mean cpm unstimulated [ °HJthymidine incorporation .
expression on cells from I « xBa ( AN ) mice was substantially decreased , we measured the cell surface expression of IL-2R subunits .
The signal-transducing components of the IL-2R , IL-2Rf3 , and y , were expressed at comparable levels in thymocytes and T cells from Tg and wild-type mice ( Fig .
5 ) .
The IL-2Ra subunit is critical for the binding of mouse IL-2 to its receptor ( 3-5 ) and for mouse IL-2R function ( 3 , 12 , 13 ) , so that the proliferative defect of thymocytes could arise from a decrease in IL-2R « expression .
Despite reports that NF- « B/Re !
l proteins are potent frans-activators of the IL-2Ra promoter in transfected cells , IL-2Ra/CD25 expression on IkxBa ( AN ) T cells was at most slightly lower than on wild-type cells , and we observed only a modest decrease in IL-2Ra expression on mature thymocytes ( Fig .
5 ) .
Since cell surface expression of the IL-2R subunits on T lymphoid cells appeared normal , the data indicate that decreased proliferation of IxBa ( AN ) reflects a failure to capacitate signal transduction by the receptor subunits .
Although a subject on which there is disagreement , the nuclear induction of Stat5 has been reported to be a key event in IL-2-induced proliferation ( 49 , 54-56 ) .
Accordingly , our data on IL-4-induced Stat5 raised the possibility that inhibition of Stats induction might represent a defect shared by IL-2R and IL-4R signaling when NF- « B was inhibited .
To test this possibility , we measured activation of Stat5 by IL-2 .
Like IL-4 , IL-2 induces phosphorylation of Stat proteins expressed from related genes ( Stat5SA and Stat5B ) ( 38 ) .
To determine whether the influence of IxBa & ( AN ) on IL-2-induced proliferation could be correlated with phosphorylation of Stat5 , we activated thymocytes and T cells from Tg and wild-type mice , followed by mobility shift assays using extracts of control and IL-2-treated cells .
This activation step was designed to mimic the conditions of proliferation assays and promote induction of IL-2Ra « .
It also leads to the production of IL-2 by wild-type thymocytes and T cells .
This IL-2 production is blocked by the Tg inhibition of NF-KB in thymocytes ( 21 ) .
The binding activity of DNA-protein complexes that comigrate with Stat5 was reduced in thymocytes ( Fig .
7A ) and T cells ( Fig .
7B ) from IxBa ( AN ) Tg mice .
Endogenous production of IL-2 by wild-type but not Tg cells led to high basal levels of 2223 binding activity in the extracts from wild-type thymocytes , but not those from IxBa ( AN ) Tg mice , and even the addition of exogenous IL-2 was unable to induce substantial binding activity .
The presence of Stat5 in this complex was validated using an antiserum specific for both StatSA and B , which eliminated the Stat5 complex and created a supershifted band of slower mobility ( Fig .
7A ) .
An independent Ab specific for StatSA also supershifted the indicated complex , whereas a control serum did not ( data not shown ) .
Stat5 induction in T cells also was impaired ( B ) .
To understand better which form ( s ) of Stat5 contributed to the mobility shift activity , extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antiserum against the individual isoforms of Stat5 , Stat5A , and Stat5B , followed by immunoblotting with an antiphosphotyrosine Ab .
As in A , endogenous IL-2 production by wild-type thymocytes led to a substantial level of Stat5A tyrosine phosphorylation that was not further increased by exogenous IL-2 .
In contrast , we observed far less phosphorylation of StatSA in cells from IxBa ( AN ) mice as compared with controls , and the addition of exogenous IL-2 did not induce phosphoStat5A ( Fig .
7C ) .
Although at lower signal intensity overall , the level of Stat5B phosphorylation in IL-2-treated cells from Tg animals was indistinguishable from wild-type samples ( Fig .
7C ) .
This finding suggested that IL-2 induction of Stat5B homodimers and perhaps Stat5AB heterodimers was quantitatively less affected than that of Stat5A homodimers .
While the decreased StatSA phosphorylation might have been attributed to a requirement for NF- « B/Re !
signaling in the induction of StatSA protein levels , wild-type and IxBa ( AN ) mice expressed similar levels of total Stat5A and Stat5B protein ( Fig .
7C ) .
We conclude that the presence of IxBa ( AN ) in Tg T lineage cells is associated with impaired phosphorylation and activation of Stat5A despite expression of all subunits of the IL-2R .
Taken together with observations linking Stat5 to T cell proliferation ( 49 , 54-56 ) through association with IL-2 but not Ag receptors ( 49 ) , these findings suggest that the observed impairment in IL-2-inducible proliferation by T cells is associated with defective Stat5A activation .
The evidence that the IxB/NF- « B/Re !
l system can regulate receptor capacitation raises the question as to whether such a role is limited to cytokines whose receptor uses Jak1 and Jak3 to induce Stat5 , or instead may be more general .
To explore this issue , we measured the ability of IL-12 to enhance the proliferation of T lymphoid cells .
PMA-primed thymocytes could not be costimulated by IL-12 ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .
8 , IL-12-en-hanced proliferation of PMA-primed T cells was inhibited by IkBa ( AN ) , although there was no enhancement of the response to other proliferative stimuli .
Thus , while the mechanism of this effect remains to be determined , the action of this cytokine through different Janus kinases ( Jak2 and Tyk2 ) and Stat proteins ( Stat3 and Statd4 ) suggests the potential for additional NF- « B-dependent mechanisms of receptor capacitation .
Discussion The activation of lymphocytes after engagement of their Ag-spe-cific receptor is a critical step in the regulation of immune responses .
Lymphocyte activation leads to the production of cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-4 .
Importantly , this activation step also induces the competence to respond to the proliferative signals provided by these lymphokines ( 5 , 12-16 ) .
However , the set of molecular mechanisms involved in this enhancement of cytokine responsiveness of normal lymphoid cells is not clear .
Signal transduction pathways activated after engagement of the TCR include the NF- « B/Re !
transcription factor family ( 19 , 20 ) , but neither IL-2 nor IL-4 induces NF- « B/Re !
transcription factors .

Defective induction of StatSA in activated , IL-2-treated T lymphoid cells .

B , B cell-depleted lymphoid cells ( T cells ) from spleen and lymph nodes of wild-type and Tg mice were activated 16 h with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 , harvested , rinsed , and recultured 30 min in complete media , alone or supplemented with IL-2 ( 10 ng/ml ) .
Whole cell extracts from these treated cells were then assayed for Stat5 by mobility shift analyses using an oligonucleotide probe that contains a Stat5 consensus sequence .
The background of Stat5-binding activity in cells not treated with IL-2 is due to IL-2 release from the activated cells ; this band was not present when using extracts of resting cells .
The identity of the indicated complexes was confirmed in thymocyte preparations by supershift analyses using antiserum specific for Stat5 ( 4/8 ) .
C , Activated thymocytes ( 16-h culture in PMA and ionomycin ) were recultured 30 min in complete media , alone or in the presence of mouse IL-2 ( 10 ng/m1 ) .
Whole cell extracts from these stimulated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-Stat5A or Stat5B antiserum .
Immune precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE , then subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab ( RC-20 ) .
Following this procedure , these filters were then divided , stripped , separately reprobed using the anti-Stat5A or Stat5B antiserum , as indicated , repositioned , and exposed to x-ray film .
The position of the StatSA and StatSB band is marked with an asterisk and a diamond , respectively .
present study , we present evidence that inhibition of IxBa degradation through expression of a franms-dominant inhibitor ( IxBa ( AN ) ) is sufficient to impair the competence of T cells to respond to the proliferative stimulus of IL-4 as well as IL-2 .
Moreover , the ability of each cytokine to induce Stat5 was diminished .
This finding raises the possibility that NF- « B/Rel proteins may play a general role in the cytokine responsiveness of lymphoid cells by a Stat5-dependent mechanism .
Two general mechanisms for enhancing the competence of cells to respond to lymphokines can be envisaged .
In the first , the composition and number of receptors are regulated in response to stimuli .
Examples of this mechanism include induction of the IL-2Ra-chain , whose association with IL-2RB and y , dramatically influences ligand affinity , and regulated changes in the number of IL-2RB-chains ( 4 , 5 ) .
Capacitation , in which the functional effects of receptors are potentiated after cellular activation or differentiation ( 5 , 15-18 , 57 ) , provides an alternative mechanism of regulation .
Receptor capacitation offers a powerful means for integration of disparate stimuli .
For instance , in some systems , IL-4 may not provide a sufficient signal for lymphocyte proliferation unless costimulatory or Ag receptors have also bound to a ligand , while in others the response of T cells to TCR , IFN-y , or IL-12 signaling may lead to inhibition of Stat6 activation by IL-4R ( 15-18 , 58 ) .
The data presented in this work support a role for NF- « B/Rel signaling in the regulation of lymphoid proliferation and Stat5 induction by IL-4 .
Such mechanisms may also apply to the regula- tion of apoptosis in T cells .
IL-4 protects lymphoid cells against apoptosis in several contexts : programmed cell death of resting and activated T cells ( 59-61 ) , and Fas-induced apoptosis of activated B cells ( 62 ) .
We have observed that while the addition of IL-4 to cultures decreased the apoptotic susceptibility of anti-CD3-treated wild-type T cells , this cytokine did not protect IxBa ( AN ) T cells from apoptosis induced by TCR cross-linking ( A. Mora , unpublished observations ) .
In this regard , it is interesting to note that IL-4-induced Stat6 was entirely dispensable for the IL-4-mediated protection against apoptosis ( 61 ) .
Since Stat5 activity may be critical for mediating IL-2-induced survival signals ( 63 ) , it is possible that the inhibition of IL-4-induced Stat5 is one mechanism by which I « Ba ( AN ) blocks survival signaling .
In contrast to the expression of IL-2R subunits after activation of IxBa ( AN ) T lymphoid cells , hyporesponsiveness to IL-4 was associated with a significant decrease in IL-4R expression ( Figs .
2 and 5 ) .
The decrease in basal IL-4Ra mRNA levels ( Fig .
2 ) may reflect an important role of NF- « B in the activity of this promoter .
Moreover , the ability of Stat6 to participate in the activation of IL-4-dependent promoters can require cooperation with adjacent cis-acting elements ( 64 , 65 ) .
NF- « B/Rel proteins can cooperate with Stat6 in the activation of the IL-4-dependent germline epsilon promoter from the Ig heavy chain locus .
Thus , the relatively modest decrease in IL-4-induced Stat6-binding activity may be amplified functionally in IxBa ( AN ) -expressing T lymphoid cells because the nuclear import of the inducible frans-activators c-Rel 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology 150 100 50 [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation ( x103 cpm ) CD3 CD3 PMA + CD28 FIGURE 8 .

Cells were pulsed for an additional 8 h with tritiated thymidine and harvested for scintillation counting .
The results are shown as the mean ( ~SEM ) tritiated thymidine incorporation in three independent experiments .
and RelA is inhibited ( 21 , 22 ) .
This decrease in receptor number was associated with a diminished capacity to activate downstream signaling pathways , particularly that leading to Stat5 induction .
However , we consider it unlikely that the decreased expression of IL-4Ra fully accounts for the impaired IL-4-dependent proliferation of IkBa ( AN ) T lymphoid cells since a constitutively expressed Tg receptor competent to generate IL-4-specific signals ( 26 ) was unable to ameliorate the proliferative defect stemming from inhibition of NF-KB .
While NF- « B/Rel !
proteins clearly participate in an important signal transduction pathway after T cell activation , most studies on their potential role in cytokine signaling have focused on culture-adapted cell lines .
In these settings , nuclear translocation of NF- « B has been associated with transcriptional activation of the IL-2Ra gene ( 66 , 67 ) .
How these findings with cell lines apply to normal T cells is unclear , since complete inactivation of either c-Rel or RelA by gene targeting had no apparent effect on IL-2Ra ( CD25 ) gene expression ( 23 , 68 ) .
These gene inactivation studies could be explained on the basis that either frams-activating subunit is sufficient to achieve normal transcriptional induction of IL-2Ra in cell lines .
However , IxBa ( AN ) interferes with the nuclear induction of both c-Rel and RelA ( 21 , 22 ) , yet activated T cells and thymocytes can express normal levels of IL-2Ra , B , and y , .
Despite normal expression of the IL-2R subunits , direct evidence of a capacitation mechanism is provided by the observation that overall Stat5 activation was dramatically decreased , with a particularly substantial effect on Stat5A ( Fig .
7 ) .
The observed tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5B in I « xBa ( AN ) T cells further suggests that these cells express functional IL-2R .
The mechanism by which NF- « B participates in this capacitation mechanism remains to be determined .
It is thought that both Jak1 and Jak3 are essential for activation of Stat5 , whereas only Jak1 appears essential for Stat6 induction ( 69-74 ) .
Moreover , Jak3 deficiency leads to a homeo-static defect characterized by a preferential decrease in the CD8 * lineage relative to CD4 * cells ( 75-77 ) , which is reminiscent of the phenotype in IxBa ( AN ) mice .
Thus , an attractive hypothesis is that Jak3 is inhibited as a consequence of IxBa ( AN ) expression in T lymphoid cells .
Although it remains to be determined whether the inhibition of Stat5A induction accounts for the entire proliferative defect of T cells , the magnitude of the observed 2225 decreases in Stat5 expression suggests a parallel to studies of IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation in Stat5A-deficient mice ( 54-56 , 78 ) .
Anti-CD3-stimulated splenocytes from Stat5A-deficient mice exhibited normal IL-2Ra « expression and decreased proliferation not unlike that observed in cultures of IxBa ( AN ) T cells supplemented with IL-2 ( Fig .
1 ) .
A failure to sustain increased CD25 expression was observed only when cells were rinsed and cultured for 2 days in IL-2 and the absence of a TCR stimulus ( 78 ) .
Thus , the present observations using T cells subjected to inhibition of NF- « B/Re !
signaling are consistent with the phenotype of Stat5A-null T cells when compared under similar condition and with other studies suggesting differential roles for these proteins ( 79 , 80 ) .
Moreover , the present data are consistent with the conclusion of previous studies that Stat5 is critical for IL-2- as well as IL-4-induced proliferation in T cells ( 48-50 , 54-56 ) , thereby suggesting that one major mechanism by which the IxB/NE- « B/Rel system regulates cytokine receptor capacitation is mediated through changes in the ability to induce nuclear Stat5 .
