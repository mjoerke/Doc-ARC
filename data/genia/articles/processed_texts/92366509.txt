7601-7605 , August 1992 Biochemistry In vivo footprint analysis of the HLA-DRA gene promoter : Cell-specific interaction at the octamer site and up-regulation of X box binding by interferon y ( in vivo genomic footprinting /major histocompatibility complex class II genes /octamer binding proteins ) KENNETH L. WRIGHT AND JEnny P.-Y .
Ting University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , Department of Microbiology-Immunology , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , NC 27599 Communicated by Ray D. Owen , May 20 , 1992 ( received for review December 16 , 1991 ) ABSTRACT Analysis of the major histocompatibility complex class II gene promoter DRA has previously identified at least five cis-acting regions required for maximal expression .
We have examined the DRA promoter for protein-DNA interactions in the intact cell , which may mediate transcriptional activation .
Using in vivo genomic footprinting we identified interactions in B-cell lines at the octamer site and the Y , X ; , and X ; boxes .
Class II antigen expressing T-cell lines maintained contacts identical to B-cell lines , while class II-negative T-cell lines exhibited no interactions .
In lymphoid cell lines , the octamer site is occupied and required for maximal expression .
This is most likely due to the presence of the lymphoid-specific OTF-2 factor .
In contrast , the class II-positive nonlymphoid glioblastoma cell line does not exhibit interactions at the octamer site despite the presence of the ubiquitous OTF-1 factor and an open binding site .
Thus , the DRA promoter discriminates against OTF-1 activation at the level of DNA binding in the glioblastoma line .
Interferon y induces class II expression in this cell line and , in parallel , up-regulates X , and X ; box protein-DNA interactions , while all other interactions remain unchanged .
These results suggest that interferon y functions on a poised promoter by altering weak , nonproductive interactions at the X boxes to strong interactions .
These findings provide direct in vivo evidence to strongly suggest that the modulation of X , and X ; interactions is an important constituent of the interferon y induction pathway .
The major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II molecules play a central role in the immune response .
MHC class II molecules can present antigen on the surface of cells , which is then recognized by the T-cell receptor of class II-restricted T cells ( 1 , 2 ) .
This interaction leads to an activation of T cells and the initiation of an immune response .
The intensity of the response is modulated by the level of MHC class II molecules on the cell surface ( 3 , 4 ) .
Specific haplotypes of class II have been linked to several autoimmune diseases ( 5 ) .
Thus , a detailed investigation of the regulation of MHC class II antigen expression is critical to our understanding of the immune response and immune system dysfunction .
Class II molecules are expressed on a select group of cell types including B cells , dendritic cells , thymic epithelial cells , skin Langerhans cells , liver Kupffer cells , brain glial cells ( 6-8 ) , and activated macrophages and T cells ( 9-12 ) .
Cytokines such as interferon y ( IFN-y ) can induce class II expression in a small number of class II-negative cell types ( 13-16 ) .
In most cases , class II expression is regulated primarily at the level of transcription , prompting extensive study of the promoter regions and in particular the HLA-DRA promoter .

This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement `` in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
7601 Two highly conserved promoter domains termed the X and Y boxes lie within the proximal promoter region of class II genes ( 17 ) .
These elements are critical for optimal class II gene expression ( 18-21 ) .
The X box interacts in vitro with at least two proteins , RF-X and hXBP-1 .
RF-X binds over the 5 end of the X box ( X ; ) and has aberrant binding in cells from patients with the bare lymphocyte syndrome ( 22 , 23 ) .
hXBP-1 binds at the 3 ' end of the X box ( X ; ) and has homology to Fos and Jun ( 24 ) .
Functional analysis with site-specific mutations has indicated that both X ; and X » are important for the constitutive level of transcription and X , is involved in IFN-y inducibility ( 24 , 25 ) .
The Y box contains an inverted CCAAT motif with which several proteins have been shown to interact in vitro .
YEBP was partially purified in our laboratory from B-cell extracts and activates the DRA promoter in vitro ( 20 ) .
YEBP may be the human analog to the murine NF-Y A/B ( 26 , 27 ) .
YB-1 was cloned from an expression library and , while its DNA recognition site is similar to those of YEBP and NF-Y , the expression of YB-1 is inversely correlated to the level of class II expression , implying a potential role as a negative regulator ( 28 ) .
In addition to the X and Y boxes , the DRA promoter is unique within the class II family in the presence of an octamer binding site between the Y and TATA boxes .
This site is functionally required in B cells but not in most nonlymphoid cell types ( 18 , 29 , 30 ) .
In addition , a less-conserved functional domain , W , lies upstream of the X box .
Functional analysis of this region has identified a Servenius sequence ( S ) , which is required for IFN-y responsiveness ( 31-33 ) .
In vitro protein-DNA studies are limited because they may not accurately reflect the in vivo state of promoter interactions .
The recent improvement of the in vivo genomic footprinting procedure ( 34 ) permits analysis of protein-DNA interactions in intact cells .
This report utilizes in vivo genomic footprinting to confirm initial findings in B cells ( 35 ) and expands it to class II-positive and class II-negative T-cell lines .
Analysis of an inducible , nonlymphoid cell line revealed the selective lack of interaction at the octamer site despite the availability of the ubiquitous octamer binding factor OTF-1 and an open binding site .
Most importantly , this analysis demonstrated that IFN-y induction of class II antigen expression is characterized by an up-regulation of X1 and X ; box interactions .

H9 ( HuT78 ) was derived from a human cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and constitutively expresses class II antigens .
HSB and Jurkat are T-lymphoblastoid cell lines ( T-LCLs ) that can not be induced to express class II antigens .
U373-MG is a glioblastoma multiform cell line ( 36 ) .
The human recombinant IFN-y was a generous gift of Biogen .
The wild-type DRA promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) fusion construct ( 5 ' A-152 WT ) has been described ( 33 ) .
The 5 ' A-152 MUTocta construct was generated by site-directed mutagenesis ( 37 ) and altered octamer motif from S'-TTGATTTGCAT-3 ' to 5'-TTGegegt-CAT-3 ' .
In Vivo Footprinting .
In vivo methylation of cells and DNA preparation were as described by Pfeifer et al .
( 38 ) .
The ligation-mediated , PCR-amplified , in vivo genomic footprinting was as described by Mueller and Wold ( 34 ) except the initial denaturation was for 10 min at 95°C and the samples were resolved on a 6 % denaturing polyacrylamide wedge gel .
The primers to reveal the upper strand with the associated annealing temperature were as follows : upper 1 , 5'-AGG-GACTCCACTTATGGA-3 ' ( 60°C ) ; upper 2 , 5-TGGGAG-TCAGTAGAGCTCGGGAGTG-3 ' ( 66°C ) ; upper 3 , 5'-GAGTCAGTAGAGCTCGGGAGTGAGGCAG-3 ' ( 68°C ) .
The primers to reveal the lower strand were as follows : lower 1 , 5-GTATATCCCTGTCTAGAAG-3 ' ( 56°C ) ; lower 2 , 5'-GTCAGATTGGGGTTAAAGAGTCTGTCCG-3 ' ( 64°C ) ; lower 3 , 5-GATTGGGGTTAAAGAGTCTGTCCGTCAT-TGAC-3 ' ( 65°C ) .
Transfection and CAT Reporter Analysis .
Cell lines were transiently transfected with 10 ug of test plasmid using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporation apparatus , and plasmid expression was assayed by CAT activity as described ( 19 ) .
CAT activity was resolved on thin-layer chromatography plates and quantitated with an Ambis Radioanalytic Image Processor .
Nuclear Extract Preparation and Gel Mobility-Shift Assay .
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al .
( 39 ) .
The gel mobility-shift assay was performed essentially as described by Gerster et al .
( 40 ) except samples were resolved on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel with TGE buffer ( 25 mM TrisHC1 , pH 7.9/190 mM glycine/1 mM EDTA ) .
The probe was a 30-base-pair synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide that encompasses the octamer element of the DRA promoter and its flanking sequences .
RESULTS A number of cis-acting DNA elements within the proximal 150 base pairs of the DRA promoter have been previously described ( see Fig .
2 ) .
This report directly assays the protein-DNA interactions at the endogenous DRA promoter by in vivo genomic footprinting .
In Vivo , the DRA Promoter Maintains Protein-DNA Interactions Across the Class II Box and at the Octamer Site in Class II-Expressing B-Lymphoblastoid Cells .
Most functional analysis of the DRA promoter has been performed in B-lymphoblastoid cell lines ( B-LCLs ) , which constitutively express high levels of class II antigen .
Thus , we chose to initially examine the in vivo protein-DNA interactions in the B-LCLs Raji and Namalwa .
In vivo genomic footprinting reveals the close association of protein with DNA in the intact cell by the protection or enhancement of dimethyl sulfate methylation of guanine residues ( 34 , 41 ) .
These protections or enhancements are then displayed as alterations in the intensity of specific bands in the guanine sequence ladder as compared to deproteinized DNA .
Class II antigen expressing B-LCLs displayed a series of guanine contact points on both the upper and lower strand of the DRA promoter ( Fig .
1 ; summarized in Fig .
2 ) .
Both Raji and Namalwa cells revealed identical patterns of interaction .

Approximately 50-60 % protection of the octamer element was consistently observed in Namalwa , Raji , and H9 .
Note that the Raji and Namalwa DMS lanes are darker overall than the corresponding control lanes .
The weak octamer protection seen in lane 8 ( Jurkat ) was not reproducible .
Contact points for the upper strand from bottom to top are -48 , -53 , -67 , -68 , -83 , -93 , -95 , -104 , -117 , and -150 .

Small dots between strands represent 10-base-pair increments starting from the transcription initiation site .
Biochemistry : Wright and Ting of the upper strand corresponds to the inverted CCAAT motif in the Y box .
Mutation of these residues has been shown ( 19 , 42 ) to diminish expression from the DRA promoter .
The large 19-base-pair region encompassing the X , and X ; , motifs is completely protected on the lower strand , with one hypersensitive site at the 3 ' end .
The upper strand also reveals protections in both X ; and X ; , with a hypersensitive site between the two motifs at -95 .
Interestingly , a single hypersensitive adenosine residue appears on the upper strand between the X region and the Y box when protein is bound to these elements .
Adenosine hypersensitivity is generated by an increased accessibility of dimethyl sulfate to the minor grove of the DNA , perhaps due to a distortion in the three-dimensional structure .
Two additional hypersensitive adenosine residues were detected upstream of the X region on the upper strand ( -117 and -150 ) .
These contact points are not obviously associated with any currently known in vitro binding sites ; however , gross deletion of the region diminishes expression in B-LCLs ( 18 , 32 , 43 ) .
Class II Negative T-LCLs Lack in Vivo Protein-DNA Interactions While a Class II-Expressing T-LCL Is Indistinguishable from B-LCLs .
Human T lymphocytes are unique in their ability to express cell-surface class II molecules upon antigen or mitogen activation ( 10-12 ) or human T-lymphotropic virus type I infection ( 44 ) .
We examined the class -expressing T-LCL H9 for in vivo protein-DNA interactions ( Fig .
1 ) .
The DRA promoter revealed guanine contact points at the oc-tamer , Y box , and X ; , and X ; motifs , which were indistinguishable from the contacts detected in B-LCLs .
Thus , it appears that in human B-LCLs and class -expressing T-LCLs the same interactions are important for class II gene expression .
However , many human T-LCLs are class II negative and can not be induced to express class II antigens .
Two such class II-negative T-LCLs-Jurkat ( Fig .
1 ) and HSB ( data not shown ) -exhibited no detectable protein-DNA interactions at the DRA promoter .
Some experiments with the Jurkat cell line suggested a weak interaction at the octamer site ( Fig .
14 ) ; however , this was not consistently reproducible .
This result is in stark contrast to the in vitro binding studies with nuclear extracts from HSB cells ( 19 ) , where DNA probes spanning the class HI box reveal specific protein-DNA interactions that are qualitatively indistinguishable from the class B- or T-LCLs .
This suggests that class II-negative human T-LCLs down-regulate DRA expression not at the level of individual transcription factors but rather at the level of chromatin structure .
In Vivo Discrimination Against OTF-1 Binding at an Available Octamer Consensus Sequence in a Functioning DRA Promoter .
In addition to the constitutive mode of class II antigen expression , several cell types can be induced to express class II by treatment with cytokines such as IFN-y .
We examined the human glioblastoma multiform line U373-MG as an example of a class II-inducible , nonlymphoid cell ( 15 ) .
The U373-MG cell line has a low level of cell-surface class II-positive cells ( 10-20 % ) , which is induced to high levels ( 70 % ) by IFN-y ( ref .
15 ; data not shown ) .
A striking deviation from the observations in class II-positive B- and T-LCLs was detected at the octamer site ( Fig .
3 , lanes 2 and 7 vs. lanes 11 and 12 ) .
No protections were displayed at the octamer consensus site on either strand .
Moreover , the octamer site remained vacant even after IFN-y induction of DRA transcription at 18 and 24 hr .
Identical results were obtained by using the melanoma cell line Thayer , which is only 1-2 % cell-surface class II positive and is induced to 80-85 % by IFN-y ( data not shown ) .
This finding prompted us to examine the functional requirement of this site and the availability of octamer transcription factors .
Functional importance was determined by transient transfection of a minimal DRA promoter construct containing either a wild-type or a mutated octamer site in the context of S , X1 , X ; , and Y Proc .

sequences .
The results confirmed a functional requirement of the octamer site in Raji B-LCL and in H9 T-LCL ( Table 1 ) .
However , in U373-MG cells mutation of the octamer site did not result in a loss of promoter function but instead caused a minimal ( < 2-fold ) increase in activity .
Thus , the functional importance of the octamer site parallels its in vivo occupancy .
A family of transcription factors ( OTF ) has been identified that binds to the octamer consensus ( 45 ) .
Nuclear extracts from Raji , H9 , and U373-MG cells were subjected to a gel mobility-shift assay with a DRA octamer probe to resolve the OTF family ( Fig .
4 ) .
The most intense band ( band A ) corresponds to the ubiquitous OTF-1 factor , according to Gerster et al .
( 40 ) , and is present in each cell line .
Thus , the lack of in vivo binding in the U373-MG cells suggests that OTF-1 is discriminated against by the endogenous DRA promoter structure in this cell line .
A second band ( band B ) , most likely representing the lymphoid-specific OTF-2 factor , is present at high levels in Raji cells .
Interestingly , in H9 nuclear extracts a weak but detectable complex comigrates with this band ( band B ) .
However , this band is absent in the U373-MG cell extracts .

IFN-y Induction of Class II Expression in a Glioblastoma Cell Line Is Paralleled by an Up-Regulation of in Vivo Binding at the X , and X , Boxes .
Before IFN-y induction , a second distinction was observed between B-LCLs and the U373-MG cell line .
The guanine residues within the X ; , and X ; , motifs were partially visible in the in vivo 0-hr sample ( Fig .
3 ) .
This is most clearly revealed on the lower strand .
The intensity of the X region guanine bands is only reduced by =60 % compared to the deproteinized control DNA .
In contrast , in the B-LCLs there was a complete protection of the X ; and X , regions .
Contact points in the Y box and upstream region were similar between the lymphoid and glioblastoma cell lines .
IFN-y treatment of the U373-MG cell line induces a peak of mRNA accumulation at 18-24 hr , which is primarily controlled at the transcriptional level ( 46 , 47 ) .
At 4 hr , no changes in the in vivo footprint are observed .
However , concomitant with the up-regulation of class II transcription , the in vivo footprint of the X region at 18 and 48 hr revealed a change to complete protection of all of the X region guanine residues ( Fig .
3 ) .
The up-regulation of in vivo interaction at the X region makes this region indistinguishable from the class -expressing lymphoid cell lines .
DISCUSSION Myriad in vitro protein-DNA binding events have been ascribed to the DRA promoter regions .
However , it remains to be determined whether the in vitro studies accurately reflect conditions in the intact cell .
The analysis described here provides important insight into the in vivo state of protein-DNA interactions at the DRA promoter .
B cells constitutively express class II and were used to define a reference panel of in vivo protein-DNA interactions in lymphoid cells .
The data obtained with B cells in this report confirm the initial findings on the upper strand of the DRA promoter by Kara and Glimcher ( 35 ) .
Their results with the Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 89 ( 1992 ) DRA gene identified promoter interactions at the octamer site and the Y , X1 , and X ; boxes .
In addition , they found a lack of all interactions in class II-deficient mutant cell lines derived from certain bare lymphocyte syndrome patients .
In this report , we have extensively expanded these initial studies in B-cell lines to include class II-positive and -negative T-cell lines and an IFN-y inducible , nonlymphoblastoid cell line .
In B-LCLs and a class II-positive T-LCL , the octamer site was occupied .
This occupancy is most likely associated with the presence of OTF-2 in lymphoid cells , although the possibility that OTF-1 occupies this site in conjunction with other lymphoid-specific factors can not be excluded at this time .
In contrast , the octamer site was vacant in the non-lymphoid , glioblastoma cell line .
This finding agrees with the functional analysis showing a requirement for these sequences in B-LCLs and a class II-positive T-LCL but not in the glioblastoma cells ( Table 1 and ref .
29 ) .
The slight increase in activity seen in the glioblastoma cells upon mutation of the octamer site may suggest an uncharacterized repressive role for this site in nonlymphoid class II-positive cells .
The apparent vacancy of the octamer site in the glioblastoma cell occurs despite the availability of the ubiquitous OTF-1 factor .
Furthermore , the lack of octamer binding is apparently not due to differences in the adjacent interactions , since all of the neighboring contact points are the same between the lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells .
These results provide the first direct evidence that in vivo the OTF-1 binding interaction is selectively excluded in a functional promoter .
One explanation for the exclusion may be inappropriate contacts between OTF-1 and the other transacting factors present on the promoter in this cell line .
At present , it is unclear whether the exclusion of octamer occupancy is unique to the glioblastoma cell line or is common to all nonlymphoid class II-positive cells .
The in vivo protein-DNA interactions at the Y box and the X ; and X ; boxes confirm the functional data defining each of these elements as required for optimal class II expression .
In B-LCLs and class II-positive T-LCLs , the X boxes were extensively protected .
The contact points are clustered into two groups .
One group lies within the X ; motif with single hypersensitive guanine residues immediately flanking each side of the X ; box , suggesting these may be the boundaries of the X ; interaction .
The second cluster lies at the 5 ' end of the X , box corresponding to the putative RF-X interaction domain .
A single unprotected guanine residue between the two groups suggests that the X ; and X ; boxes are separate and distinct binding events .
The hypersensitive adenosine residue appearing approximately midway between the X and the Y boxes suggests that this region of the DNA structure may be distorted-for example , by DNA bending .
This is compatible with a previous study , which demonstrated a functional requirement for the stereospecific alignment of the X and Y boxes that was independent of the absolute distance between the two domains ( 48 ) .
This suggests that the X and Y box factors are able to bend the intervening DNA to come in direct or indirect contact .
In addition , the hypersensitivity occurs only in the presence of X and Y box protein-DNA interactions , suggesting that the putative DNA bend may be driven by the protein-protein contacts or , alternatively , by protein-DNA contacts .
The glioblastoma cell line U373-MG can be induced by IFN-y to express high levels of class II ( 15 , 32 ) .
Before IFN-y induction , the interactions at the X ; and X ; boxes are weak compared to B-LCLs .
Concomitant with the induction of DRA transcription , the X box interactions increase in intensity to levels indistinguishable from B cells .
No other changes are detected during the induction .
Identical results were obtained with the melanoma cell line Thayer , which are induced to ~80 % class II-positive by IFN-y .
These results Biochemistry : Wright and Ting indicate that in an inducible cell the DRA gene is poised for expression with the majority of protein-DNA interactions in place .
However , the X box interactions are weak and potentially nonproductive .
IFN-y may induce a modification of the existing X box interactions to make the binding productive or , alternatively , induce new protein-DNA interactions .
Recent results have confirmed an increase in X box binding in vitro in primary rat astrocytes ( 33 ) .
Interestingly , no contact points directly attributable to the S site were detected .
Functional analysis of the IFN-y induction has demonstrated a requirement for the S site .
It is possible that the S interaction escapes detection by the in vivo footprinting tech-nique .
Alternatively , the S domain may be the site of a transient binding activity only required in the initial stages of the IFN-y response .
A transient interaction has been recently demonstrated for the overlapping IFN-a/y response site in the gene of the guanylate-binding protein ( 49 ) .
In contrast to the poised promoter detected in the glioblastoma cell line prior to induction , the class II-negative T-LCLs displayed no protein-DNA interactions .
Class II-negative T-LCLs can not be induced to express DRA and thus do not maintain a poised promoter .
Down-regulation of transcription through prevention of all interactions at the promoter , perhaps by reordering the chromatin structure , would be an effective mechanism to down-regulate the entire class II locus .
In summary , B- and T-lymphoid cells expressing the class II DRA gene , maintain constitutive protein-DNA interactions at the octamer site and the Y , X1 , and X , boxes .
However , the octamer site is not occupied in the nonlymphoid cell line in congruence with lymphoid-specific function of this site .
In addition , there is a dynamic up-regulation of X box binding in parallel with the induction of expression by IFN-y in class II-inducible cell lines .
