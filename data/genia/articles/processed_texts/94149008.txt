The effects of G-CSF are mediated by binding to specific , high affinity receptors .
G-CSF receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , but activation of the receptor results in the rapid induction of tyrosine kinase activity .
Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots of whole cell lysates prepared from neutrophils show that the G-CSF rapidly induces prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of a relative molecular mass of 80 kDa .
Using monospecific antibodies , the 80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein has been shown to be p80° `` `` `` , a proto-oncogene belonging to a family of transcriptional regulators which include NF-kB .
The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of p80° `` `` `` was unique to G-CSF in that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor which also stimulates neutrophils and induces tyrosine phosphorylation does not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of p80° `` ¢ .
The consequences of p80° `` `` tyrosine phosphorylation are not yet known ; however , tyrosine-phosphorylated p80° `` `` is capable of binding to DNA , and G-CSF stimulation results in an increase in the amount of p80° `` `` which binds to DNA .
These results demonstrate that one of the first biochemical events which occurs in neutrophils following G-CSF stimulation , activation of a tyrosine kinase , leads directly to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p80° `` `` `` .
Thus , the tyrosine kinase activated by G-CSF appears to directly transduce a signal to a protein which functions as a transcriptional regulator .

fects are mediated through binding of G-CSF to a specific , high affinity cell surface receptor .
The human G-CSF receptor is a glycoprotein of relative molecular mass 100-130 kDa ( 4 ) .
Ho-modimerization of the receptor is believed to be necessary to create a high affinity binding site for G-CSF ( 5 ) .
However , post-receptor signal transduction mechanisms remain largely unknown .
Although the G-CSF receptor does not possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , one of the earliest events following G-CSF binding to its receptor is the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of at least one and possibly several intracellular proteins ( 6 ) .
Identification of the proteins which become tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimw.lation of neutrophils with G-CSF is likely to be important in understanding the signal transduction pathways required for neutrophil function .
In this study , the major protein which is inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated following treatment of neutrophils with G-CSF has been identified as p80° `` .
The p80° `` * `` protein is encoded for by a proto-oncogene ( 7 , 8 ) which belongs to a family of transcriptional regulatory proteins which include v-re/ , the oncogene product of the avian reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T ( rev-T ) ( 9 ) , the maternal effects gene dorsal of Drosophila ( 10-12 ) , and the ubiquitous factor NF-kB ( 13-15 ) .
These results demonstrate that one of the first biochemical events which occurs in neutrophils following G-CSF stimulation , activation of a tyrosine kinase , leads directly and rapidly to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p80° `` `` .
Thus , the tyrosine kinase activated by G-CSF appears to directly transduce a signal to a protein which functions as a transcriptional regulator .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents-Highly purified recombinant human G-CSF and GM-CSF were gifts of Dr. Steven Clark and Gordon Wong , Genetics Institute , Cambridge , MA .
Endotoxin , tumor necrosis factor , platelet activating factor , CSa , fMet-Leu-Phe , and phorbol ester were purchased from Sigma .
Antisera-The antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was generated using phosphotyramine as the immunogen and was used as described ( 16 ) .
The rel antiserum is a polyclonal rabbit antiserum prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the unique carboxyl-ter-minal 16 amino acids of human p80 % * ( 17 , 18 ) .
Preparation of Human Neutrophils-Normal peripheral blood was obtained from healthy adult volunteers and fractionated on a Ficoll-Hypaque density step gradient ( 1.077 g/ml ) .
The pellet was washed twice with Hanks ' balanced salt solution ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
Red blood cells were lysed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C in ammonium chloride ( 8.29 g/liter , pH 7.27 ) .
The neutrophil pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) containing 0.5 % bovine serum albumin , Fraction V ( Sigma ) at 5 x 10° cells/ml .
Stimulation with Factors and Cell Lysis-Neutrophils were pre-treated with 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate ( Sigma ) for 30 min at 4°C to inhibit proteases before factor stimulation .
Cells were then 5387 5388 warmed to 37 °C and treated with G-CSF at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for 0-60 min .
Other factors and concentrations used for stimulation were GM-CSF ( 10 ng/m ! )
, endotoxin ( 10 ng/ml ) , tumor necrosis factor ( 100 units/ml ) , platelet-activating factor ( 10-8 m ) , C5a ( 10- ' m ) , fMet-Leu-Phe ( 10- ' m ) , and phorbol ester ( 10-° m ) .
Following stimulation , cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer ( 20 mm Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , 150 mm NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Nonidet P-40 ) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( Sigma ) , 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin ( Sigma ) , 10 ug/ml leupeptin ( Sigma ) , and 1 mm sodium ortho-vanadate ( Sigma ) at 4 °C for 20 min at a concentration of 10° cells/ml .
Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 x g. Alternatively , cells were lysed in DNA affinity precipitation buffer as described below .
It should be noted that we have compared lysates prepared by boiling in SDS to lysates made in NP40 with and without EDTA and have found no significant differences in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins .
Immunoprecipitations , Gel Electrophoresis , and Immunoblotting-Whole cell lysates ( 5 x 10° cells ) were mixed 1:1 with 2 x SDS buffer ( 19 ) with 2-mereaptoethanol ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) and heated at 95 °C for 3 min prior to one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 7.5 % polyacrylamide .
For immunoprecipitations , lysates containing 1 x 10 `` cells were incubated with 20 ul of 4G10 cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnolgy Inc. ) at 2 mg/ml as described elsewhere ( 20 ) or 5 ul of polyclonal p80° ' `` antiserum at 4 °C for 4 h. Anti-rel immune complexes were collected by incubation with 25 ul of Protein A-Sepharose for an additional 30 min at 4 °C .
Immune complexes were washed once with lysis buffer , twice with 0.5 m LiCl , 20 ma Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , and once with phosphate-buffered saline .
Washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in an equal volume of water , then mixed with sample buffer and treated as described above prior to gel electrophoresis .
After electrophoresis , proteins were electrophoretically transferred to 0.2-um nitrocellulose ( Schleicher & Schuell ) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris , 192 mi glycine , and 20 % methanol at 0.4 A for 4 h at 4 °C .
Residual binding sites were blocked by incubation in TBS ( 10 mm Tris , pH 8.0 , 150 mm NaCl ) containing 2 % gelatin for 60 min at 25 °C .
The blots were incubated overnight at room temperature with antiphosphotyrosine antibody ( 1.5 ug/ml ) or for 2 h with rel antiserum diluted 1:1000 in TBST ( TBS with 0.05 % Tween 20 ) .
Antibody reactions were detected as previously described ( 16 , 18 ) .
Prestained molecular weight markers were run on each gel and were obtained from Life Technologies , Inc. DNA Affinity Precipitation ( DNAP ) Assay-Human neutrophils ( 2 x 10° ) either untreated or stimulated with G-CSF were lysed twice in 600 ul of DNAP buffer as described elsewhere ( 21 ) .
Dithiothreitol ( final concentration 1 mm ) , phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride ( 1 mm ) , leupeptin ( 10 mm/m ! )
, and phenyl arsine oxide ( 37 um ) were added immediately before use .
The final potassium chloride ( KCI ) concentration was 250 max for the extraction and 50 mx for the binding assay .
The final sodium fluoride ( NaF ) concentration was 50 mm .
A 40-fold excess of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia ) was used per DNAP assay .
The binding reaction was performed with 100 pmol of biotinylated oligonucleotide .
The oligonucleotides were synthesized by ISIS Pharmaceuticals , San Diego , CA .
The oligonucleotides were synthesized with a 3 ' end biotin group and had a phosphothiorate backbone rendering them nuclease insensitive .
They were otherwise identical to previously reported HIV-1 kB wild type and mutant oligonucleotides ( 21 ) .
The biotinylated oligonucleotide-protein complexes recovered by binding to streptavidin-agarose beads were washed four times with 400 ul of DNAP buffer containing 50 mm NaF and 75 mm KCl .
A DNase/RNase digest was performed for 2 min on ice ( 21 ) .
The complexes were heated for 3 min at 95 °C in Laemmli sample buffer ( 50 ul/pellet ) ( 19 ) and were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and detected by immunoblotting as described above .
RESULTS G-CSF Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of an 80-kDa Protein in Human Neutrophils-Human neutrophils stimulated with G-CSF were evaluated by immunoblotting with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody in order to determine whether G-CSF receptor stimulation results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of any novel intracellular proteins .
As can be seen ( Fig .
1 ) , the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins seen following G-CSF stimulation of neutrophils was relatively simple .
The major change was the inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of relative molecular mass of 80 kDa .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of this 80-kDa protein could be seen G-CSF Stimulates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of rel - G 200 116 80 _- 49 | n Inne Fic .

Identification of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in human neutrophils after stimulation with G-CSF .
Neutrophils prepared from fresh heparinized blood were treated with G-CSF ( 10 ng/ml ) for 15 min prior to lysis as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
Changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation were detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody .
Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left in kilodaltons .
as early as 5 min following G-CSF treatment of neutrophils and remained relatively constant when examined in a 1-h time course ( Fig .
2 ) .
Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the 80-kDa Protein Is Specific to Stimulation of Neutrophils with G-CSF-Signal transduction through receptor linked tyrosine kinases is a relatively common phenomenon .
Therefore , the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins obtained following G-CSF stimulation of neutrophils was compared to that obtained following treatment with a variety of other factors known to stimulate neutrophil function .
Treatment of neutrophils with GM-CSF resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 130 , 93 , 70 , and 42 kDa as previously described ( 16 , 22 ) .
Similarly , phorbol ester stimulation resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 42-kDa protein which has been shown to be MAP-2 kinase ( 23 ) .
Other factors for which neutrophils contain receptors , such as endotoxin , C5a , tissue necrosis factor , and fMet-Leu-Phe failed to result in any discernible changes in tyrosine phosphorylation at the time point chosen ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein following G-CSF stimulation appears to be specific to the G-CSF signal transduction pathway .
The 80-kDa Tyrosine-phosphorylated Protein Is p80° % ' `` -Previous reports have shown p80® ' `` to be inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated in T cells following stimulation with phytohe-magglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( 18 ) .
Given this finding , a rel-specific antiserum was employed to determine whether the 80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein seen following stimulation of neutrophils with G-CSF was p80¢ ' `` `` .
In unstimulated neutrophils , no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of p80¢ `` `` could be detected .
However , G-CSF treatment of neutrophils resulted in the presence of an 80-kDa protein which can be detected in anti-rel immunoprecipitates followed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting or by antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates followed by anti-rel immunoblotting ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
Similar amounts of p80 could be immunoprecipitated from control and factor-treated cells ( data not shown ) .
Serial immunoprecipitations demonstrate that approximately 5-10 % of total cellular p80 `` is inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated and that the majority of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 80-kDa protein can be depleted with rel antiserum ( data not shown ) .
Thus , p80° `` appears to account for most of the 80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein seen in neutrophils following G-CSF stimulation .

G-CSF Treatment of Neutrophils Results in an Increase in DNA Binding of p80° `` `` -Nuclear lysates of untreated and factor treated neutrophils were examined in order to determine whether the G-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p80¢ `` `` resulted in any alteration in DNA binding of p80 `` .
G-CSF treatment of neutrophils results in an increase in the amount of p80°¢ `` `` which is capable of binding to an HIV-1 kB site ( Fig .

Tyrosine-phosphorylated p80 `` is capable of binding to DNA and most of the increase in p80° ' `` bound to DNA can be accounted for by the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of p80°¢'* `` .
A small amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated p80¢® `` `` was detected in unstimulated neutrophils ; however , this is comparable to the background tyrosine phosphorylation observed in immunoblots ( Fig .
2 ) .
DISCUSSION The results presented here demonstrate that stimulation of neutrophils with G-CSF results in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of p80¢ ' `` .
G-CSF treatment of neutrophils not only results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 `` but results in 5389 A _ ReLLP .

DNA affinity precipitation of p80¢ `` `` following stimulation of neutrophils with G-CSF .
Neutrophils ( 1 x 10®/lane ) unstimulated or stimulated with G-CSF were prepared and lysed as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
Nuclear lysates were incubated with a wild type or mutant kB site .
Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies ( top panel ) or rel antisera ( bottom panel ) .
The migration of p80° `` * ' is marked with an arrow .
This experiment has been performed seven times , each with similar results .
an increase in the amount of p80° `` * `` which is capable of binding to a kB site .
Most of this increase can be accounted for by the tyrosine-phosphorylated p80¢ ' `` species .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of p80¢ `` `` is specific to stimulation of neutrophils with G-CSF .
Although GM-CSF is similar to G-CSF in its ability to stimulate the function of neutrophils for tumor cell killing and an enhanced respiratory burst , the proteins which become tyrosine-phosphorylated in neutrophils following GM-CSF treatment are different than those seen inducibly phosphorylated after G-CSF treatment .
These data suggest that different kinases become activated following binding of ligand to their cognate receptors .
Alternatively , the same kinase could have differing substrate specificity depending on the manner in which it is activated .
These data also suggest that the tyrosine kinase pathway of signal transduction utilized by G-and GM-CSF may be responsible for the unique 5390 effects of each of these factors rather than for their overlapping functions .
However , it remains possible that these two pathways could converge on common downstream effectors .
The major protein which becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of neutrophils with G-CSF is p80° `` `` .
The p80° `` * `` protein is encoded for by a proto-oncogene which belongs to a family of transcriptional regulatory proteins which include v-re/ , the oncogene product of the avian reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T ( rev-T ) ( 9 ) .
Other members of this family include the maternal effects gene dorsal of Drosophila which has a role in the establishment of dorsal/ventral polarity of the Drosophila embryo ( 10-12 ) .
Another well characterized member of this family is the transcription factor NF-kB which is composed or two rel-related proteins ( 13-15 ) .
NF-kB activity is induced by a variety of agents including cytokines , mitogenic lectins , and phorbol esters ( 24 , 25 ) .
The rel proteins are regulated in part by subcellular localization .
NF-kB appears to be sequestered in an inactive form in the cytoplasm through its association with IkB which in turn is associated with the cyto-skeleton by virtue of ankryin repeats ( 14 , 26 , 27 ) .
Cellular activation results in the phosphorylation of IkB , releasing NF-kB which translocates to the nucleus where it can bind to and modulate the transcriptional activity at kB sites ( 24 , 28 ) .
Although similar interactions have been demonstrated for p80° , it has also been shown that p80° ' `` function can be modified directly by phosphorylation of p80 ( 26 , 27 , 29 ) .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of p80° `` `` has been demonstrated in T cells following stimulation with PHA and PMA and was associated with translocation of p80¢ ' to the nucleus ( 18 ) .
The present study extends these findings by showing that G-CSF stimulation of neutrophils results in an increase in the binding of tyrosine phosphorylated p80 `` isoforms to a kB site .
The functional consequences of p80°* tyrosine phosphorylation have not been determined .
As the increase in DNA binding of p80° `` `` could be accounted for largely by the tyrosine-phosphorylated form , it is possible that tyrosine phosphorylation results directly in an increase in the DNA binding ability of Alternatively , tyrosine phosphorylation might alter the ability of p80¢* to modulate transcriptional activity of specific promoters or may regulate subcellular localization of p80° `` .
The results presented here implicate p80¢ `` `` as an important signal-transducing protein in G-CSF-stimulated pathways in G-CSF Stimulates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of rel neutrophils .
The specific transcriptional program modified by p80¢ `` `` following G-CSF treatment of neutrophils remains to be determined as does the kinase responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of p80¢ ' `` .
However , this study provides some initial clues which should be helpful in the dissection of the signal transduction pathways utilized by the G-CSF receptor .
