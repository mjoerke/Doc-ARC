4 Transcriptional Activation of Human { 2 Globin Promoter by the a Globin Regulatory Element ( HS-40 ) : Functional Role of Specific Nuclear Factor-DNA Complexes QINGYI ZHANG , `` P. M.

It was shown by transient expression assay that HS-40 behaved as an authentic enhancer for high-level { 2 globin promoter activity in K562 cells , an erythroid cell line of embryonic and/or fetal origin .
Although sequences located between -559 and -88 of the C2 globin gene were dispensable for its expression on enhancerless plasmids , they were required for the HS-40 enhancer-mediated activity of the £2 globin promoter .
Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this HS-40 enhancer-£2 globin promoter interaction is mediated by the two GATA-1 factor binding motifs located at -230 and -104 , respectively .
The functional domains of HS-40 were also mapped .
Bai 31 deletion mapping data suggested that one GATA-1 motif , one GT motif , and two NF-E2/AP1 motifs together formed the functional core of HS-40 in the erythroid-specific activation of the £2 globin promoter .
Site-directed mutagenesis further demonstrated that the enhancer function of one of the two NF-E2/AP1 motifs of HS-40 is mediated through its binding to NF-E2 but not API transcription factor .
Finally , we did genomic footprinting of the HS-40 enhancer region in K562 cells , adult nucleated erythroblasts , and different nonerythroid cells .
All sequence motifs within the functional core of HS-40 , as mapped by transient expression analysis , appeared to bind a nuclear factor ( s ) in living K562 cells but not in nonerythroid cells .
On the other hand , only one of the apparently nonfunctional sequence motifs was bound with factors in vivo .
In comparison to K562 , nucleated erythroblasts from adult human bone marrow exhibited a similar but nonidentical pattern of nuclear factor binding in vivo at the HS-40 region .
These data suggest that transcriptional activation of human embryonic { 2 globin gene and the fetal/adult a globin genes is mediated by erythroid cell-specific and developmental stage-specific nuclear factor-DNA complexes which form at the enhancer ( HS-40 ) and the globin promoters .
Similar to those of other vertebrates , the human B- and « -like globin gene families are each arranged as gene clus-ters .
The B cluster is on chromosome 11 , and the a cluster is on chromosome 16 ( reviewed in reference 5 ) .
Transcriptional activities of genes contained within both clusters are confined in erythroid cells , and they are sequentially turned on and off during development in the order of their physical arrangement in the clusters ( reviewed in reference 15 ) .
Genetic evidence and direct experimental data suggest that the regulation of each globin gene family is controlled by regulatory elements located many kilobases upstream of each gene cluster ( 11 , 12 , 41 ) .
These sequences , referred to as the B locus control region ( B-LCR ) and the a globin regulatory element ( HS-40 ) , not only act as classical enhancers in transient expression assays ( references 21 , 22 , 28 , 35 , and 42 and this study ) but also confer erythroid lincage-specific and integration site-independent expression of linked promoters in stably transformed cell lines or transgenic mice ( 11 , 12 ; reviewed in references 7 , 25 , and 36 ) .
Similar to the B-LCR ( 8 , 11 , 41 ) , the location of « globin regulatory element was first mapped near one of four erythroid cell-specific , DNase I-hypersensitive sites located 10 to 40 kb upstream of the embryonic { 2 globin gene ( 12 ) ( Fig .
1A ) .
Further fine-mapping studies have located the a globin * Corresponding author .
2298 regulatory elements , referred to as HS-40 , within a 350-bp Taql-XmnI fragment located 40 kb away from the { 2 globin gene ( 14 ) ( Fig .
1A ) .
The presence in cis of HS-40 confers erythroid-specific expression of the human « globin gene in stably transformed cell cultures , as well as in transgenic mice in a developmental stage-specific manner ( 12 , 14 ) .
Like the B-LCR , the molecular mechanisms by which HS-40 activates transcription of human « -like globin genes in erythroid cells are unknown .
However , data from functional analysis of the human B globin locus ( references 2 , 4 , 9 , 18 , 22 , 24 , 27 , 35 , and 39 and references therein ) and genomic footprinting of the B-LCR of both humans ( 13 , 30 , 38 ) and mice ( 31 ) suggest that these enhancer-promoter interactions are mediated by nuclear factor-DNA complexes formed at the enhancers and individual globin upstream promoters .
Because HS-40 was identified more recently , relatively less is known about this enhancer region than the B-LCR .
First , although HS-40 activates transcription of the a globin genes ( 12 , 14 , 28 ) , it is not known whether it is also an erythroid-specific enhancer for embryonic { 2 globin gene expression .
Second , if HS-40 indeed activates the { 2 globin promoter , where are the functional domains of the enhancer and the promoter that are responsible for the functional interaction in vivo between these two regulatory elements ?
This question is of particular interest since both regulatory elements bind multiple nuclear factors in vitro in nuclear extracts ( 14 , 43 ) .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid constructs .
All recombinant DNA work was done as described previously ( 33 ) .
A cloning vector , pOGH { Nichols Institute ) , was used to construct p { 126-GH and p { 597-GH .
pOGH is a pUC12-based plasmid containing a promoterless human growth hormone ( GH ) gene immediately downstream from a unique BamHI site ( 34 ) .
Upstream of the BamHI site is a polylinker .
p { 126-GH was constructed by cloning a 126-bp { 2 globin promoter fragment from Psfl ( -88 ) to Pvull ( +38 ) into the BamHI site of pOGH .
p { S597-GH was constructed by cloning a 597-bp £2 globin promoter fragment from EcoRI ( -559 ) to Pvull ( +38 ) into the BamHI site of pOGH .
pHS40-£126-GH and pHS40-£597-GH were constructed by blunt-end ligation of a 373-bp EcoRI-BamHI fragment , isolated from pXAJa « and containing the HS-40 enhancer ( 14 ) , into the HindIH site within the polylinkers of p { 126-GH and p { 597-GH , respectively .
The HS-40 enhancer sequences of both pHS40-£597-GH and pHS40-£126-GH are in the genomic orientation with respect to transcriptional direction of the { 2 globin promoter .
A plasmid , pHS40 ( r ) -£597-GH , was also isolated in which HS-40 was cloned in the antigenomic orientation .
pHS40 ( 3 ' ) - £597-GH contains the HS-40 enhancer cloned at the EcoRI site downstream of the GH gene of p { 597-GH .
The linear maps of all these plasmid constructs are diagrammed in Fig .
2B .
Plasmid clones containing truncation mutants of HS-40 upstream of the { 2 globin promoter were constructed as follows .
A 653-bp helper restriction fragment was isolated from pBR322 by EcoRI and Sa/l codigestion , blunt ended with Klenow enzyme , and then ligated into the blunt-ended Sall site of plasmids pHS40-£597-GH and pHS40 ( r ) -£597-GH , respectively .
The resulting two plasmids were each linearized at the HindIII site located near the 5 ' end of the helper fragment and several base pairs downstream of the HS-40 enhancer , digested with BalZ31 exonuclease for different lengths of time , recut with Xbal to remove the residual helper fragment , blunt ended with Klenow enzyme , circularized with DNA ligase , and then transformed into Escherichia coli DHSa .
The extents of deletions of the HS-40 enhancer sequence in different recombinant clones were determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing of miniplasmid preparations with the M13 forward primer and the Seque-nase protocol from US Biochemicals .
The above strategy ensures that all truncated forms of HS-40 enhancer , in either genomic or antigenomic orientation , are flanked by the same DNA sequences .
Appropriate clones were then selected , and plasmid DNAs were prepared by the alkaline sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) lysis procedures and CsCl equilibrium centrifugation ( 33 ) .

Plasmids p { 597 ( mt 1 ) -GH and pHS40-£597 ( mt 1 ) -GH are similar to p£ { 597-GH and pHS40-£597-GH , respectively , except that the distal GATA-1 binding site in the { 2 globin promoter of the former plasmids has been changed by site-directed mutagenesis ( see Fig .
3A and text ) .
Plasmid pHS40- { 597 ( mt 2 ) -GH is similar to pHS40-£597-GH , except that the proximal GATA-1 binding site in the £2 globin promoter of the former plasmid has been changed by site-directed mutagenesis ( see Fig .
4A ) .
Plasmid pHS40 ( r-mt 1 ) -£597-GH is similar to pHS40 ( r ) -£597-GH except that the 3° NF-E2/AP1 binding site in the HS-40 of pHS40 ( r-mt 1 ) -£597-GH has been mutated by mutagenesis .
Plasmid pHS40 ( mt 2 ) -£597-GH is similar to pHS40-£597-GH except that its GATA-1 ( b ) motif has been mutagenized ( see Fig .
7A and text ) .
Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved by the use of a commercially available kit [ pBluescript II KS ( - ) ; Stratagene ] .
Candidate DNA fragments containing the sequence ( s ) to be mutated were cloned into the pBluescript II KS ( - ) vector , and mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer 's specification .
The oligonucleotide primers 5-GGGTGGGGCCCCGAGCTCT CCTAGACTCTG-3 ' and 5-CACTGGATCTAGAAAGAAA CACCAC-3 ' were used for mutagenesis of the distal and proximal GATA-1 binding sites of { 2 globin promoter , respectively .
The oligonucleotide primers 5-GATGACTCAGAAG TCCTGTTGG-3 ' and 5-GTTGGCCCAGAATTCTGCTCCC TCAAGT-3 ' were used to mutagenize the 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 and GATA-1 ( b ) motifs of the HS-40 enhancer , respectively .
After verification by DNA sequencing , DNA fragments containing the mutated sites were cut out from pBluescript II KS ( - ) and cloned back into the appropriate vectors to form p£597 ( mt 1 ) -GH , pHS40-£597 ( mt 1 ) -GH , pHS40-£597 ( mt 2 ) -GH , pHS40 ( r-mt 1 ) -£597-GH , and pHS40 ( mt .
2 ) -£597-GH , respectively .
DNA transfection of cell cultures .
Erythroid K562 cells , lymphoid Raji and Jurkat cells , and nonerythroid HeLa cells were cultured under 5 % CO ; , in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1 M HEPES ( N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethane-sulfonic acid ) ( Sigma ) , 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U of penicillin per ml , and 50 pg of streptomycin per ml ( all from GIBCO ) .
For DNA transfection , cells were harvested at densities of 0.7 x 10° to 1.2 x 10° cells per ml .
A total of 10 `` cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 ug of test plasmids , 1 mg of pSV2-CAT ( 10 ) , and 35 pg of salmon sperm DNA as a carrier .
DNA transfection was done by electroporation ( 29 ) in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at a capacity of 960 mF and appropriate voltages : 300 V for K562 and 350 V for HeLa cells .
After electroporation , the transfected cells were kept in 100-mm petri dishes .
For each plasmid construct , three or more DNA transfection experiments were done to obtain average values of the promoter activities .
GH and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays .
Forty-eight hours after DNA transfection , the levels of human GH secreted into the media by the transfected cells were quan-titated with the Allegro hGH radioimmunoassay kit from Nichols Institute as previously described ( 34 ) .
Samples and standards were diluted eightfold with horse serum to lower the biotin concentration in the RPMI 1640 medium to the manufacturer 's recommended values .
When the concentrations of GH in the medium exceeded 50 ng/ml , further dilutions were done to obtain a linear range for the hGH assay .
Transfection efficiencies were checked by measuring the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme activities in extracts of transfected cells ( 10 ) .
RNA preparation and primer extension analysis .
Cytoplas- Vor .
13 , 1993 mic RNAs were prepared by the method described in reference 16 with some modifications .
Briefly , cells from each transfection experiment were harvested after 48 h , washed once with 5 ml of cold ( 4°C ) phosphate-buffered saline ( pH 6.8 ) , and lysed with 0.6 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.65 % Nonidet P-40 , 150 mM NaCl , 1.5 mM MgCl ; , and 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.8 ) .
The lysate was kept in ice for 1 to 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 rpm and 4°C in an Eppendorf Microfuge .
The supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube and mixed with 0.6 ml of 7 M urea-10 mM EDTA-350 mM NaCl-1 % SDS-10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) .
The mixture was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol .
RNA pellets were dissolved in 50 to 100 ul of diethyl pyrocarbonate ( DEPC ) -treated H , O , and their qualities and quantities were analyzed by spectrophotometric measurement of a diluted aliquot as well as by electrophoresis on denaturing formaldehyde gels ( 33 ) .
Quantitation of { -GH hybrid RNAs from enhancer-carrying plasmids in transfected K562 cells was done by primer extension analysis ( 33 ) with an oligonucleotide primer complementary to the sense strand of the human GH gene : 5'-TGGTTCGGGGAGTTGGGCCTTGGGATC-3 ' .
As an internal control , the primer extension reactions also included an oligonucleotide primer that would hybridize to and be extended on the endogenous human £2 globin transcripts : 5'-GACACAATGATGGTCCTCTCAGTCTITGGTCAGAGA-3 ' .
The expected extension products from the { -GH hybrid RNA and endogenous { globin RNA are 64 and 93 nucleotides long , respectively .
In vivo DMS footprinting .
Genomic footprinting of the HS-40 enhancer in intact cells was done by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction according to references 23 and 26 with some modifications ( 30 ) .
K562 , Raji , Jurkat , and HeLa cells were harvested at the log phase of growth and treated with dimethyl sulfate ( DMS ; Fluka ) .
Lymphocytes from human blood were isolated by Histopaque ( Sigma ) gradient centrifugation ( 3 ) , resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium , and treated with DMS .
To analyze genomic footprints in nucleated adult erythroblasts , adult human bone marrow cells were obtained by iliac crest aspiration from a homozygous sickle cell volunteer donor .
Buffy coat cells were washed and subjected to direct immune adherence , using Falcon petri dishes precoated with monoclonal antibody 23.6* , which is specific for CFU-E ( erythroblast ) , erythroblasts , and erythrocytes .
The adherent cell population collected consisted of approximately 60 % erythrocytes and 40 % erythroblasts .
Of the nucleated cells , 90 % were erythroblasts ; approximately 10 % were various classes of nonerythroid marrow cells ( 6 ) .
These cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium and treated with DMS as described above .
Genomic DNAs were prepared by standard methods ( 33 ) .
As a control , purified K562 or HeLa DNA was empirically treated in vitro with DMS as described previously ( 30 ) .
DNA samples treated in vivo or in vitro with DMS were then subjected to B-elimination cleavage reaction with 1 M piperidine ( Aldrich ) to cleave at the methylated G residues ( 19 ) .
Samples were then frozen and lyophilized under high vac-uum .
Trace amounts of piperidine were removed by washing and lyophilizing samples two to three times with deionized water and finally precipitated with ethanol .
Piperidine-cleaved DNA fragments ( 2 to 3 mg ) were hybridized with target-specific oligonucleotide primer set A or B and then amplified by polymerase chain reaction .
The final products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 7 M urea-6 % polyacryl-amide gels and by autoradiography .
The experiments were ENHANCER-PROMOTER INTERACTION OF HUMAN { 2 GLOBIN GENE 2301 repeated with three or more separate batches of DMS-treated cells to ensure the reproducibility of the genomic footprinting data .

RESULTS Erythroid lineage-specific activation of human £2 globin promoter activity by HS-40 enhancer .
Previous expression studies have demonstrated that the presence in cis of HS-40 confers high-level erythroid tissue-specific transcription of the human adult a globin gene in transgenic mice and when stably integrated into mouse erythroleukemia cells ( 12 ) .
To test whether the embryonic { 2 globin gene can also be activated by HS-40 in an erythroid cell-specific manner , we did transient expression analysis of the { 2 globin promoter activity with and without the presence in cis of the HS-40 enhancer .
To start this , two different human { 2 globin promoter fragments spanning sequences from -88 to +38 and from -559 to +38 were individually cloned into the BamHI site of cloning vector pOGH .
The resulting plasmids , and p { 597-GH , were then transfected into erythroid K562 and nonerythroid HeLa cell cultures .
At 48 h posttransfection , the amounts of GH secreted into the media were measured by radioimmunoassay .
Average values from multiple sets of transfection experiments were obtained after normalization against chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme activities expressed from cotransfected pSV2-CAT plasmid ( see Materials and Methods for more details ) .
As shown in Fig .
2 , the 597- and 126-bp { 2 globin promoter fragments exhibited similarly low levels of promoter activities in both K562 and HeLa cells .
We next cloned a 373-bp fragment containing the HS-40 enhancer sequence , in the genomic orientation , into the HindIII sites of p { 126-GH and Comparison of GH activities secreted by transfected K562 cells indicated that the presence in cis of the HS-40 enhancer increases promoter activity of the 597-bp £2 globin fragments by approximately 175-fold and that of the 126-bp fragment by 40-fold ( compare pHS40-£597-GH with p£597-GH and pHS40-£126-GH with p { 126-GH , Fig .
2B ) .
On the other hand , the presence in cis of HS-40 could only enhance the promoter activities of the above two fragments in HeLa cells by approximately threefold ( Fig .
2B ) .
That HS-40 functions as a true enhancer of the { £2 globin promoter was demonstrated by transient expression assay of plasmids in which HS-40 was placed in the antigenomic orientation upstream of the promoter [ pHS40 ( r ) - { 597-GH , Fig .
2B ] or downstream of the GH reporter gene [ pHS40 ( 3 ' ) -£597-GH , Fig .
2B ] .
In both cases , the enhancer effects of HS-40 in K562 cells were comparable to that of pHS40-£597-GH .
Thus , we conclude that in a transient expression assay , HS-40 acts as an erythroid cell-specific enhancer , and it potentiates high levels of human { 2 globin promoter activity in an orientation- and position-independent manner .
Both GATA-1 factor binding motifs of the £2 globin promoter act as erythroid-specific enhancer-responsive elements .
The observed enhancer effect of HS-40 on the { 2 globin promoter activity is most likely modulated by the interaction of multiple nuclear factor-DNA complexes formed at the enhancer and the promoter .
Previously , we have studied nuclear factor-DNA interaction of the upstream promoter 2302 ZHANG ET AL .

region of human { 2 globin gene in K562 and HeLa nuclear extracts ( 43 ) .
It was demonstrated that the { 2 globin upstream promoter consists of binding sites for nuclear factor CP 2 at -70 , GATA-1 at -104 and -230 , Spl at -240 , ZF 1 at -210 , and ZF 2 at -150 ( 43 ; Fig .
2A ) .
Of these , CP 2 , ZF 1 , ZF 2 , and Spl are ubiquitous factors present in K562 and HeLa extracts , while GATA-1 is restricted to erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages .
We chose the GATA-1 binding sites as our first target for the site-directed mutagenesis experiment for two reasons .
First , the GATA-1 factor is erythroid specific and may participate in the high level of enhancer-mediated activity of the £2 promoter in K562 cells .
Second , each of the two GATA-1 sites overlaps a binding site of Sp1 , and dual functions of these two nuclear factors have been proposed ( 43 ) ( Fig .
2A ) .
To test the function of the distal GATA-1 site , we constructed two plasmids similar to p { 597-GH and pHS40-£597-GH , except that the distal GATA-1 sites in these clones were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis ( Fig .
3A ) .
These two mutants , p { 597 ( mt 1 ) -GH and pHS40-£597 ( mt 1 ) -GH , were then transfected into K562 cells , and their expression levels were compared with those of the wild-type plasmids .
As shown by the GH assay , the promoter activity of p { £597 ( mt 1 ) -GH is similar to that of the wild-type p { 597-GH but that of pHS40-£597 ( mt 1 ) -GH is only about 40 % that of the wild Mor .

The latter result was also confirmed by primer extension analysis of RNA isolated from transfected cells ( Fig .

These data demonstrated that the distal GATA-1 binding site is an essential HS-40 enhancer-responsive promoter element of the { 2 globin promoter , although it does not appear to be involved in the { 2 globin promoter function in the absence of the HS-40 enhancer .
Disruption of the proximal GATA-1 binding site of the { 2 globin promoter appeared to have an even more drastic effect on its enhancer responsiveness to HS-40 .
As shown in Fig .
4 , the GH mRNA level in K562 cells transfected with pHS40-£597 ( mt 2 ) -GH is only approximately 15 % that of those cells transfected with the wild-type plasmid pHS40-£597-GH .
Functional domains of HS-40 enhancer in transcriptional activation of £2 globin promoter .
Previous sequence analysis ( 14 ) of the 355-bp HS-40 enhancer-containing region has revealed three sequence motifs with the binding consensus 5-GATA-3 ' of the GATA-1 nuclear factor ( reviewed in references 7 and 25 ) , three motifs of the pentanucleotide GGTGG that could be recognized by multiple nuclear factors ( 40 ) , one GTGG sequence , and two copies of the hepta-nucleotide sequence 5'-TGAGTCA-3 ' that could bind NF-E2 or API ( 1 , 17 , 20 , 32 ) .
Further nuclear factor-DNA binding in vitro indicated that the three GATA-1 motifs mentioned above [ GATA-1 ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( d ) , Fig .
1 ] , as well as a 5-GATT-3 ' motif [ GATA-1 ( c ) , Fig .
1 } , indeed bind GATA-1 factor in nuclear extracts prepared from erythroid HEL or K562 cells .
Of the four GT motifs ( GT -I through -IV , Fig .
1 ) , however , only GT-II binds two ubiquitous nuclear factors in nuclear extracts ( 14 ) .
Finally , both NF-E2/AP1 motifs , 5 ' and 3 ' ( Fig .
1 ) , could bind nuclear factor NF-E2 or API in vitro ( 14 , 37 ) .
( i ) Bal 31 deletion mapping .
To determine which one ( s ) of the above motifs participates in the enhancer function of HS-40 , we constructed two series of Bal 31 deletion clones from plasmids pHS40-£597-GH and pHS40 ( r ) -£597-GH , respectively ( see Materials and Methods ) .
In these deletion clones , the HS-40 enhancer was truncated from either the 3 ' Vor .

Data from the GH assay are in general agreement with the primer extension assay ( data not shown ) .
As summarized in Fig .
5 , stepwise deletion of the HS-40 enhancer indeed affected the expression of { 2 globin promoter activity in K562 cells , with levels of expression depending on the extent of the deletion reaction .
Thus , comparison of expression levels of clones 1 , 2 , and 3 to the wild type indicates that the presence of the GATA-1 ( d ) motif is not essential for the HS-40 enhancer to function .
Further deletion of 14 bp from clone 3 , which removed half of the GATA-1 ( c ) motif , decreased the { 2 globin promoter activity by approximately 60 % ( compare clone 4 with clone 3 , Fig .
5 ) .
This low level of expression was seen in clones 4 to 7 , indicating that in the absence of a functional GATA-1 ( c ) motif , the entire GT-III and GT-IV motifs and the 3 ' end of the GT-II motif are not required for the residual enhancer activity of HS-40 ( see further discussion later ) .
Finally , removal of the 5 end of the GT -II motif together with the 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 motif from clone 7 abolished all enhancer activity of HS-40 in K562 cells ( compare clones 8 and 9 with clone 7 , Fig .
5 ) .
Transient expression analysis of deletion constructs with the antigenomic orientation of the HS-40 enhancer showed that motifs GATA-1 ( a ) , GT-I , and GATA-1 ( b ) were not required for HS-40 enhancer activity ( compare clones 15 and 16 with the wild-type clone , Fig .
5 ) .
Further deletion of the 5 ' NF-E2/API motif from clone 15 resulted in a drop of 50 to 70 % of the enhancer activity ( compare clones 13 and 14 with clone 15 , Fig .
5 ) , indicating that this motif plays an important role in the HS-40 enhancer function .
A further deletion of clone 13 , which extended 3 bp into the 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 motif , completely abolished the enhancer activity ( compare clones 10 to 12 with clone 13 , Fig .
5 ) .

( ii ) Site-directed mutagenesis of 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 and GATA-1 ( b ) motifs .
Data from the above Bal 31 deletion mapping analysis , in particular those of the clone pairs 7 and 8 and 12 and 13 , suggest that the 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 motif may play a central role in HS-40 function .
To test this while maintaining the overall integrity of HS-40 , we did site-directed mutagenesis and introduced a G-to-T substitution at the first base of the 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 motif ( Fig .
7A ) .
A similar base substitution of the tandemly arranged NF-E2/AP1 motifs of human B globin locus-specific enhancer 5° HS-2 was shown to completely abolish the 5° HS-2 enhancer function ( 21 , 24 ) .
The plasmid construct with the above point mutation of 3 ' NF2/AP1 motif , pHS40 ( r-mt 1 ) -£597-GH , was transfected into K562 cells , and its expression level was compared by primer extension analysis to that of the wild-type clone pHS40 ( r ) -£597-GH ( Fig .
7B , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
As shown , the point mutation reduced the expression level by approximately 70 % , although it did not completely destroy HS-40 enhancer function .
We also analyzed RNA from K562 cells transfected with plasmid pHS40 ( mt 2 ) -£597-GH , in which the GATA-1 ( b ) motif of HS-40 was modified by point mutagenesis .
As shown by primer extension analysis ( Fig .
7B , lanes 3 and 4 ) , the GATA-1 ( b ) motif is not involved in the enhancer function of HS-40 .
This result is consistent with the Bal 31 deletion data of Fig .
5 and 6 .
Genomic footprinting of HS-40 .
To investigate whether the functional roles of different sequence motifs in HS-40 , as revealed by the above transient expression analysis in K562 cells , are modulated by specific nuclear factor- DNA complexes formed in vivo , we did genomic footprinting analysis of the HS-40 enhancer in K562 cells , adult erythroblasts , and various types of nonerythroid cells .
Intact cells were first treated with DMS , and differences in the methylation reactivity of G residues in vivo were then compared to that of protein-free DNA .
As shown below , erythroid-specific footprints in the HS-40 enhancer were observed at both of the NF-E2/AP1 motifs , one of the GT motifs , and three of the Mor .
CELL .
BioL .
four GATA-1 motifs .
These footprinting data are shown in Fig .
8 and 9 and summarized in Fig .
10 .
( i ) NF-E2/AP1 motif .
The DMS footprinting pattern of the coding strand of HS-40 shows clearly that both NF-E2/API1 motifs are protected extensively in the two types of erythroid cells , K562 and erythroblasts , but not in nonerythroid cells including lymphocytes , HeLa , Raji , and Jurkat cell lines ( Fig .
8A ) .
These erythroid-specific footprints are manifested by the protections of residues G-130 , G-160 , and G-165 in K562 cells and erythroblasts ( Fig .
8A , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Extensive footprints were also observed on the noncoding strands of both NF-E2/AP1 motifs in K562 cells and erythroblasts ( Fig .
8B , lanes 10 and 11 ) .
Interestingly , the footprinting patterns of the 5° NF-E2/AP1 are different between the two types of erythroid cells as manifested by the significant hyperreactivity of G-134 and the almost complete protection of G-132 in K562 cells ( Fig .
8B ) .
( ii ) GT motifs .
Of the four GT sequence motifs , only one of them binds a nuclear factor ( s ) in vivo , and this binding is erythroid cell specific .
As shown in lane 2 of Fig .
8A , motif GT-II and its 5'-flanking region are protected extensively in K562 cells at residues G-175 , G-176 , G-178 , and G-179 and to a lesser extent at G-173 and G-177 .
The protection is less extensive in the erythroblasts ( Fig .
8A , lane 3 ) , although both types of erythroid cells exhibit similar levels of hyperreactivity at G-182 .
The nuclear factor binding in vivo at the GT-II motif is erythroid specific since it could not be detected in lymphocytes or HeLa , Raji , and Jurkat cells ( Fig .
8A , lanes 4 and 6 to 8 ) .
We did not see any obvious footprint at GT-III ( Fig .
8A ) , GT-IV ( Fig .
9B ) , or GT -I ( data not shown ) .
( iil ) GATA-1 motifs .
Three of the four GATA-1 motifs of HS-40 appear to bind nuclear factors , presumably GATA-1 , in vivo in an erythroid-specific manner .
In particular , G-112 within the GATA-1 ( b ) motif is protected in both K562 cells and erythroblasts ( Fig .
9A ) but not in other types of cells ( data not shown ) .
This erythroid-specific protection of GATA-1 ( b ) is accompanied by the hyperreactivity of G-109 ( Fig .
IA ) .
Nuclear factor binding of the GATA-1 ( c ) motif in K562 cells and erythroblasts is indicated by the weak protection of G-218 on the coding strand ( Fig .
9B , compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 4 ) , which is not seen in lymphocytes ( Fig .
9B , lane 7 ) or other nonerythroid cells ( data not shown ) .
Protection of G-250 immediately upstream of GATA-1 ( d ) suggests binding of GATA-1 factor at this motif in erythroblasts ( Fig .
9C , lane 10 ; see further discussion later ) .
This binding was not detected in K562 cells ( Fig .
9C , lane 9 ) or other nonerythroid cells ( data not shown ) .
The locations of the primers used in our assay did not allow genomic footprint analysis of GATA-1 ( a ) motif .
In addition , we consistently observed in K562 cells and erythroblasts , but not in nonerythroid cells , hyperreactivities of G-234 and G-237 on the coding strand ( Fig .
9C ) and G-238 on the noncoding strand ( Fig .
9D ) of HS-40 .
Interestingly , all these hyperreactive G residues are located in between GATA-1 ( c ) and GATA-1 ( d ) motiis .
DISCUSSION We studied the functional interaction between human £2 globin upstream promoter and the a globin regulatory element HS-40 .
Previous expression analysis in stably transformed cell lines and transgenic mice has shown that high-level transcription of the human a globin gene in adult erythroid cells is regulated by HS-40 ( 12 , 14 ) .
Our transient expression assay demonstrated that HS-40 also acts as an Vor .

The data are summarized in Fig .
10. enhancer for human { 2 globin promoter activity in embryonic erythroid cells .
Furthermore , this enhancer-promoter interaction is mediated by both GATA-1 nuclear factor binding motifs within the { 2 globin upstream promoter .
We also mapped the functional domains of the HS-40 enhancer by deletion and mutagenesis experiments .
The locations of the functional domains mapped correlate well with motifs that form specific protein-DNA complexes in embryonic erythroid cells .
As shown in Fig .
2B , long ( -559 to +38 ) and short ( -88 to +38 ) promoter fragments of the { 2 globin gene exhibit similarly low level of promoter activities in either erythroid K562 or nonerythroid HeLa cells .
There are three reasons for this observation .
First , DNA sequences between -559 and -88 , including the two GATA-1 motifs at -230 and -104 , ZF 1 at -210 , and ZF 2 at -150 ( Fig .
2A ) , do not play significant role in transient expression of { 2 globin promoter activity in erythroid cells .
Second , different nuclear factor binding sites may act as positive or negative regulatory sequences in K562 cells , and the effects of different motifs could cancel each other .
A third possibility is that one or more of these nuclear factor binding motifs indeed plays a function role , but its effect on the £2 promoter activity has to be exerted through the HS-40 enhancer .
A site-directed mutagenesis experiment with the GATA-1 motifs at -230 and -104 ( Fig .
3 and 4 ) provided an interesting example of the third scenario .
Each of these motifs overlaps with a binding site of the ubiquitous transcription factor Spl ( 43 ) ( Fig .
2A ) .
In the absence of GATA-1 factor , i.e .
, in HeLa cell extract or in K562 cell extract preincubated with a GATA-1 factor binding oligonucleotide , efficient binding of Spl is easily detected .
However , when GATA-1 and Spl factors coexist , binding of GATA-1 is dominant and excludes further binding of Spl .
Also , prebound Spl could be displaced by exogenously added GATA-1 ( 43 ) .

{ globin promoters , and thus it may play essential function in the regulation of the £2 globin gene .
However , whether one or both nuclear factors act as a transcriptional activator or repressor in embryonic and/or adult erythroid cells remains speculative ( 43 ) .
Our transient expression data ( Fig .
3 and 4 ) indicate that both GATA-1 motifs behave as positive regulatory sequences for transcriptional activation of the { 2 globin gene in the embryonic and fetal erythroid environment and that at least the distal GATA-1 site at -230 does so only when the HS-40 enhancer is present in cis .
Whether other nuclear factor binding motifs , i.e .
, the Spl at -240 , ZF 1 at -210 , and ZF 2 at -150 , may also play positive or negative functional roles in the HS-40 enhancer- { 2 globin promoter interaction is unknown at this moment .
In any case , the HS-40 enhancer-mediated high level of £2 globin promoter activity in erythroid KS562 cells at least involves functional , and probably physical , interaction between protein-DNA complexes formed at the distal and proximal GATA-1 motifs and those formed in the HS-40 regulatory region .
Indeed , functional assays of truncated and point-muta-genized forms of HS-40 indicate that multiple nuclear factor binding motifs of HS-40 are involved in its erythroid-specific enhancer function of { 2 globin gene expression .
Analysis of Bal 31 deletion mutants of HS-40 suggests that GATA-1 ( a ) , GATA-1 ( b ) , and GATA-1 ( d ) are not required for the HS-40 enhancer function in transfected K562 cells .
That the GATA-1 ( b ) motif is not required for HS-40 to function as an enhancer in K562 cells is also supported by the site-directed mutagenesis experiment ( Fig .
7 ) .
Similarly , deletion of GT-I , GT-III , or GT-IV has no obvious effect on the HS-40 enhancer effect ( Fig .
5 ) .
On the other hand , GATA-1 ( c ) , 5 `` NF-E2/AP1 , 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 , and possibly GT-II appear to form the functional core of HS-40 in K562 cells .
The role of 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 was not immediately obvious from the Bal 31 deletion analysis since both the 3° NF-E2/AP1 and the GT -II motifs are deleted in clone 8 relative to clone 7 ( Fig .
5 ) .
However , site-directed mutagenesis of 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 motif clearly established its functional role ( Fig .
7 ) .
Whether GT -II is a functional part of the HS-40 enhancer remains to be investigated .
Although clone 7 , relative to clone 6 , has 2 bp removed from the pentanucleotide sequence 5¢-GGTGG-3 ' of GT-II ( Fig .
5 ) , the main body of the genomic footprint near GT -II in K562 cells lies to its left part ( Fig .
8 and 10 ) , suggesting that G-181 and G-182 may not be required for the formation of a functional protein-DNA complex in vivo in the vicinity of the GT-II motif .
Genomic footprinting data ( Fig .
10 ) suggest that the function of the core HS-40 elements , i.e .
, 5° NF-E2/API1 , 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 , GATA-1 ( c ) , and the GT -II motif , is most likely mediated through the cooperative interaction of specific nuclear factor-DNA complexes formed in vivo in the vicin-ities of these motifs .
These complexes could be detected in erythroid K562 cells in which the HS-40 enhancer function was assayed , but not in nonerythroid cells .
On the contrary , except for the GATA-1 ( b ) motif , those apparently nonfunctional motifs of HS-40 showed no evidence of binding of nuclear factors in vivo ( Fig .
10B ) .
The primary factor ( s ) that binds to the 5 ' and 3 ' NF-E2/ AP1 motifs of HS-40 in K562 cells is most likely the erythroid-specific protein NF-E2 , although the participation of AP1 could not be completely ruled out .
An in vitro assay has shown that both of these motifs are capable of binding to NF-E2 as well as API ( 14 , 37 ) .
However , the point mutation we introduced into the 3'° NF-E2/AP1 motif would abolish the binding of NF-E2 but have no effect on that of API ( 20 , $ Mor .

( A ) Summary of genomic footprinting data of the HS-40 enhancer .

8 and 9 , are indicated by the open and filled circles , respectively .
( B ) Correlation of nuclear factor binding motifs and functional domains of the HS-40 enhancer .
The 10 sequence motifs of HS-40 with the potential to bind nuclear factors are indicated on top .
The actual patterns of nuclear factor binding in vitro , in erythroblasts , and in K562 cells are exhibited on the first , second , and third lines , respectively .
The motifs bound with nuclear factor ( s ) are indicated by boxes , while those that remain unbound are indicated by horizontal lines .
The six vertical arrows indicate the hyperreactivities of residues G-234 , G-237 , and G-238 .
The binding of the GATA-1 ( a ) motif in erythroblasts and K562 cells was not assayed and is represented by the broken lines .
The asterisks ( * ) indicate motifs for which the genomic footprints differ between erythroblasts and K562 cells .
The apparently nonfunctional and functional motifs of HS-40 , as suggested by Bal 31 deletion mapping ( Fig .
5 and 6 ) and a site-directed mutagenesis experiment ( Fig .
7 ) , are individually indicated by - and + signs , respectively .
The functionality of the GT-II motif awaits further confirmation , and it is thus indicated by ( + ) ( for more details , see text ) .
21 , 24 ) , and it did significantly decrease the HS-40 enhancer function ( Fig .
7 ) .
Thus , at least binding of the NF-E2 factor to the 3 ' NF-E2/AP1 motif plays an essential role in the transcriptional activation of the human { 2 globin gene by HS-40 .
Previous protein binding experiments in vitro showed that Sp1 , TEF 2 , and another unknown factor might bind to GT-II of HS-40 ( 14 ) and to a GT motif in the 5 ' HS-2 enhancer of the B-LCR ( 40 ) .
The exact nature of the protein ( s ) bound to the GT motifs in vivo remains to be established .
Interestingly , there exist specific differences in the genomic footprinting patterns of HS-40 in K562 cells in comparison with adult erythroblasts .
First , the DMS protection patterns on the noncoding strand of 5° NF-E2/AP1 motif differ between the two types of cells ( Fig .
8B and 10A ) .
Vor .
13 , 1993 Second , factor binding to the GT-II motif and its flanking DNA also differs in that the extents of protection of G-175 , G-176 , G-178 , and G-179 are stronger in K562 cells than in erythroblasts ( Fig .
8A and 10A ) .
Finally , GATA-1 ( d ) , although devoid of factor binding in vivo in K56G2 cells , appears to bind some protein ( s ) in the adult erythroblasts .
Interestingly , this GATA-1 ( d ) motif also binds a specific factor ( s ) , presumably GATA-1 , in an interspecies human-mouse somatic cell hybrid line J3-8B which is of adult erythroid origin ( 37 ) ( see below ) .
It is tempting to speculate that these differences in footprints may reflect a fundamental difference in the structure of protein-DNA complexes of HS-40 , and consequently their function , in erythroid cells of different developmental stages .
Strauss et al .
( 37 ) have used a guanine and adenine ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction to analyze the genomic footprints of HS-40 of a human chromosome 16 introduced into mouse adult erythroid environment by somatic cell hybridization .
The genomic footprints of HS-40 in this cell line , J3-8B ( 37 ) , are similar but not identical to those in the human adult erythroblasts ( Fig .
10 ) .
Thus , nuclear factors appear to bind to the two NF-E2/AP1 motifs and three GATA-1 motifs [ ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) ] in both J3-8B cells and erythroblasts , although minor differences in the DMS protection patterns at certain G residues do exist within and/or near these motifs .
Of the three hyperreactive G residues downstream from the GATA-1 ( c ) motif in erythroblasts and K562 cells ( Fig .
10B ) , two of them ( G-237 and G-238 ) are also hyperreactive in the J3-8B cells ( 37 ) .
The major difference between the genomic footprints of J3-8B cells and erythroblasts is that the GT-II motif is bound with nuclear factor ( s ) in erythroblasts but not in J3-8B cells , while the situation with the GT-IV motif is reversed .
The significance of these similarities and differences of genomic footprints at the HS-40 region in J3-8B cells and erythroblasts remains to be established .
In summary , we demonstrated that HS-40 is an authentic enhancer for human embryonic { 2 globin gene transcription in transient expression assays in embryonic and/or fetal erythroid cells .
This transcriptional activation process appears to be modulated by interactions between multiple nuclear factor-DNA complexes formed in vivo at the HS-40 enhancer region and in the { £2 globin promoter .
It is likely that a modification ( s ) of the conformation of one or more of these nuclear factor- DNA complexes is responsible for the differential expression of { 2 globin gene to high levels in embryonic erythroid cells and the a globin gene to high levels in adult erythroid cells .
