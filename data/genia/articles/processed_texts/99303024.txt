PML mRNA and protein , while barely detectable in quiescent HPCs , are consistently induced by growth factor stimulation through the erythroid or granulocytic lineage .
Thereafter , PML is downmodulated in late granulocytic maturation , whereas it is sustainably expressed through the erythroid pathway .
In functional studies , PML expression was inhibited by addition of antisense oligomers targeting PML mRNA ( « -PML ) .
Interestingly , early treatment ( day 0 HPCs ) with « -PML reduced the number of both erythroid and granulocytic colonies , whereas late treatment ( day 5 culture ) reduced erythroid , but not granulocytic , clono-genesis .
These findings suggest that PML is required for early hematopoiesis and erythroid , but not granulocytic maturation .
The pattern of PML expression in normal hematopoiesis mimics that of retinoblastoma pRb 105 .
Combined treatment of HPCs with « -PML and « -Rb oligomers inhibited both PML and Rb protein expression and completely blocked erythroid colony development .
Furthermore , PML and pRb 105 were co-immunopreci-pitated in cellular lysates derived from - erythroid precursors indicating that this functional interaction may have a biochemical basis .
These results suggest a key functional role of PML in early hematopoiesis and late erythropoiesis : the latter phenomenon may be related to the molecular and functional interaction of PML with pRb 105 .
Keywords : HPCs ; PML ; RB ; erythropoiesis Introduction Hematopoiesis involves the coordinate activation of genetic programs that control the processes of lineage commitment and maturation ( Shivdasani and Orkin , 1996 ) .
The genes that take part in chromosome rearrangements of human acute leukemias are most likely involved in the control of differentiation and prolifera-tion .
Many of these genes are important regulators of normal hematopoiesis ( Sawyers et al .
, 1991 ; Rabbitts *Correspondence : C Peschle , T Jefferson University , Kimmel Center , Bluemle Life Science Building , 233 South 10th Street , Philadelphia , PA 19107-5541 , USA Received 26 May 1998 ; revised 5 November 1998 ; accepted 13 January 1999 1991 ) .
The t ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal translocation , found at molecular level in over 95 % of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) , involves the retinoic acid receptor a ( RAR « ) gene on chromosome 17 and the PML gene on chromosome 15 , generating the PML/ RARs « fusion gene that encodes fusion proteins ( Warrell et al .
, 1993 ; Grignani et al .
, 1994 ) .
The PML/RARa « protein plays a major role in the pathogenesis of APL ( Alcalay et al .
, 1992 ) .
Expression of PML/RAR « in myeloid cell lines blocks differentiation and decreases sensitivity to apoptotic cell death ( Grignani et al .
, 1993 , 1995 ; Rousselot et al .
, 1994 ) .
In addition , PML/RARa transgenic mice develop an APL-like leukemia ( Grisolano et al .
, 1997 ; He et al .
, 1997b ; Brown et al .
, 1997 ) .
The PML protein-dimerization and RAR « DNA binding domains must interact to ensure the biological activity of PML/RAR « ( Perez et al .
, 1993 ; Grignani et al .
, 1996 ) .
This finding suggests that the biological effects of the fusion protein depend on the alteration of both RAR « and PML function , the latter possibly mediated by protein-protein interactions ( Grignani ef al .
, 1996 ) .
A role in normal hematopoietic differentiation has been established for RAR « ( Kastner et a/ .
, 1992 ) ; however , little is known about the physiological function of PML .
Ablation of murine PML protein by homologous recombination revealed a possible role for PML in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursors , possibly mediated via interaction with the RA pathway ( Wang et al .
, 1998 ) .
Therefore , the study of PML protein expression and role in normal hematopoiesis is relevant for the comprehension of both the pathogenesis of APL and the physiology of hematopoiesis .
PML is a phosphoprotein associated with the nuclear matrix and expressed in most tissues ( Daniel et al .
, 1993 ; Chang et al .
, 1995 ) .
It belongs to a large family of proteins with common structural features , including a RING motif , two additional Cys/His-rich regions , named B-boxes and a coiled coil region , through which PML is able to form homodimers and , in APL cells , heterodimers with PML/RAR ( Kastner et al .
, 1992 ; Goddard et al .
, 1991 ; Reddy et al .
, 1992 ; Borden et al .
, 1995 , 1996 ) .
Within the nucleus , the PML protein is mainly localized in specific subdomains , the PML nuclear bodies ( PML-NBs ) ( Dyck et al .
, 1994 ) .
In APL cells the PML-NBs are disrupted and PML colocalizes with PML/RARa in novel structures called microspeckles ( Dyck et a/ .
, 1994 ; Koken et al .
, 1994 ; Weis et al .
, 1994 ) .
The delocalization of PML by PML-RAR « , is associated with cellular transformation and can be reversed by treatment of cells with RA , that induces reaggregation Expression and role of PML and Rb proteins in erythropoiesis C Labbaye et al 3530 of PML-NBs , and cellular differentiation ( Dyck et a/ .
, 1994 ; Koken et al .
, 1994 ; Weis et al .
, 1994 ) .
Similarly , APL patients achieve clinical remission after all-trans RA therapy ( Huang et al .
, 1988 ; Castaigne et al .
, 1990 ; Warrell et al .
, 1991 ) .
These observations suggest that integrity of the PML function is required in normal hematopoiesis and that protein-protein interactions occurring within the PML NBs are relevant for normal hematopoietic differentiation .
The disruption of PML NBs is also caused by cytomegalovirus ( Ahn and Hayward , 1997 ) , herpes virus ( Everett and Maul , 1994 ; Everett et al .
, 1997 ) and adenovirus infection ( Doucas et al .
, 1996 ) , as a consequence of the interaction of viral proteins with the PML NB protein complexes ( Ahn et al .
, 1998 ) .
The biological activity of PML is still under investigation .
PML has been regarded as a growth regulator ( Mu et al .
, 1994 ; Liu et al .
, 1995 ; He et al .
, 1997a ; Guiochon-Mantel et al .
, 1995 ) .
Indeed , when overexpressed , it suppresses : ( i ) anchorage-independent growth of APL-derived NB4 cells ( Mu et al .
, 1994 ) ; ( ii ) oncogenic transformation of rat embryonic fibroblasts by cooperative oncogenes and of NIH3T3 cells by activated Neu ( Liu et al .
, 1995 ) ; and ( iii ) growth and tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells ( He et a/ .
, 1997a ) .
These findings suggest that PML shares many properties with tumor suppressors .
The molecular pathway through which PML exerts its function remains unknown , although it has been suggested that PML can act as a transcription coregulator ( Guiochon-Mantel et al .
, 1995 ) .
The PML protein may also be involved in the regulation of normal hematopoiesis as suggested by its role in cell growth control ( Wang et al .
, 1998 ; Mu et al .
, 1994 ) and gene transcription block in APL ( Grignani et al .
, 1993 ; Daniel et al .
, 1993 ) .
We have investigated PML gene expression and function in highly purified human adult HPCs induced to proliferate and differentiate to terminal stages along the erythroid ( E ) or granulopoietic ( G ) lineage ( Labbaye et al .
, 1995 ) .
We show here that PML expression is regulated during normal hematopoiesis in a differentiation and lineage-dependent manner and is required in early hematopoiesis and E , but not G , maturation .
The pattern of PML expression in HPCs resembles that of pRb 105 ( Condorelli et al .
, 1995 ) .
pRb 105 may exert its biological functions by interacting with other proteins ( Chen et al .
, 1996a , b ) as in the case of viral proteins which are implicated in PML-NB disruption during infection ( Nevins , 1992 ) .
In this regard , we show that PML and Rb proteins functionally and physically interact in erythropoiesis .
Results Expression of PML mRNA in HPC erythroid ( E ) or granulopoietic ( G ) cultures We have previously reported a purification procedure for early HPCs from adult peripheral blood .
The Step IIIP cell population obtained by this procedure ( CFU-GEMM , BFU-E and CFU-GM ) is characterized by > 90 % CD34* cells and 90-95 % HPC frequency ( Condorelli et al .
, 1995 ; Giampaolo et al .
, 1994 ; Labbaye et al .
, 1995 ) .
In FCS- liquid suspension culture , these cells undergo selective proliferation and differentiation along the erythroid pathway , upon addition of very low amounts of IL-3 and GM-CSF and a saturating level of Epo , or for the granulopoietic neutrophilic lineage , upon addition of low-dose IL-3+GM-CSF and saturating G-CSF level ( Condorelli et al .
, 1995 ; Labbaye et al .
, 1995 ) .
In the first week of culture , HPCs show a high proliferative activity which is associated with their progressive differentiation , as evidenced by the progressive decline of CD34* cells ( Figure 1 ) .
In the second week we observed the disappearance of CD34* and blasts and the progressively increasing expression of specific membrane markers for E and G precursors ( e.g .
glycophorin A and CD15 , respectively ) ( Figure 1 ) ; cell morphology analysis showed a gradual wave of maturation along the E and G pathway to terminal cells , i.e .
, at day 14 , 97+2 % erythroid cells ( largely orthochromatic normo-blasts ) in E cultures , and ~98 % granulopoietic cells in G culture ( largely mature neutrophils ) ( Figure 1 ) .
To evaluate the expression of PML mRNA in differentiating HPCs , RNA samples were generated at sequential days from Step IIIP HPCs differentiating along the E or G pathway .
Three independent RT PCR experiments were performed .
A series of controls , including dose-response curves for the assayed templates ( not shown ) , ensured a semiquantitative evaluation of mRNA levels ( representative results are shown in Figure 2a ) .
PML mRNA , is barely expressed in quiescent HPCs and is rapidly induced through the first week of culture in both E and G culture .
In the second week , high levels of PML-mRNA expression are sustained through terminal maturation ( days 7-13 ) in the E pathway .
In the G lineage , PML-mRNA expression is down-regulated at early granulopoietic precursor stage ( days 7-11 of culture ) and is virtually abolished through terminal maturation ( day 13 ) ( Figure 2a ) .
Expression of PML protein in differentiating HPC cultures We then monitored the kinetics of PML protein expression by indirect immunofluorescence .
In differentiating HPCs , an anti-PML mAb labeled nuclear structures as previously described ( Flenghi et al .
, 1995 ) for PML NBs ( Figure 2b and c ) .
At day 0 , quiescent HPCs displayed low nuclear PML expression .
Initial differentiation of HPCs along the E or G pathway was associated with a marked induction of PML , as suggested by the increase of fluorescence staining ( Figure 2b and c , day 5 ) .
In the second week , PML expression was still elevated in differentiating E culture ( days 7-11 ) ( Figure 2b ) abruptly declines in G culture after day 9 and almost completely disappears in mature granulopoietic cells ( G , day 13 ) ( Figure 2¢ ) .
PML protein expression during E and G differentiation was quantitated by counting the number of PODs detected by immunofluorescence staining ( see Table 1 ) .
This analysis showed that the number of PODs peaks at days 3-5 in G cultures and at days 5-7 in E cultures ; at later times of culture although the number of PODs per cell declines both in E and G cells , this phenomenon is much more pronounced in the G lineage ( see Table 1 ) .

To confirm these data , we performed Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from HPCs harvested at day 9 and day 12 of E or G cultures , respectively ( Figure 3 ) .
Consistent with previous reports ( Nason-Burchenal et al .
, 1996 ) , the PG-M3 mAb used to detect the PML proteins ( Flenghi et a/ .
, 1995 ) , recognizes several PML isoforms , originated by differential mRNA splicing ( Fagioli et al .
, 1992 ) , with bands of 90 and 70 K , ( Figure 3 ) .
PML protein was abundant in day 9 and 12 erythroblasts , whereas it was sharply downmodulated in granulopoietic precursors ( Figure 3 ) .
As a positive control for one of the PML isoforms we used a U937 cell line clone stably transfected with a PML3 cDNA ( Flenghi et al .
, 1995 ) .
Overall , protein data strictly paralleled mRNA expression .
Effect of PML antisense oligodeoxynucleotide on HPC E and G colony formation We examined the role of PML in hematopoietic differentiation by inhibiting PML protein expression with phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to PML mRNA ( Figure 4a and b ) .
Antisense oligomers were added to differentiating HPCs stimulated by hematopoietic growth factors to form erythroid ( BFU-E ) and/or G ( CFU-G ) colonies .
Control cultures were mock treated with equivalent amounts of the scrambled antisense oligomers .

of PODs evaluated on at least 200 cells two sets of phosphorothioate antisense PML oligomers in our experiments .
HPCs treated at day 0 showed a marked dose-dependent inhibition of both E and G colonies ( Figure 4a ) .
Both sets of antisense oligomers ( « 1-PML , « 2-PML ) gave similar inhibitory patterns .
However the first set was preferred because the scrambled « 1-PML was absolutely neutral in our assay while the scrambled « 2-PML gave ~ 20 % non specific inhibitory effect .
In addition the antisense « 2-PML was less efficient in inhibiting both the E and the G cultures than the antisense « 1-PML ( Figure 4a ) .
Treatment at day 5 after growth factor addition , selectively inhibited E , but not G , colonies ( Figure 4b ) .
Scrambled oligomer « 1-PML treatment had no effect on colony formation at either culture time ( Figure 4a and b ) .
3531 Expression and role of PML and Rb proteins in erythropoiesis C Labbaye et al 3532 Control experiments showed that antisense oligomer treatment clearly decreased PML protein expression in day 3 , 5 , and 9 in E and G cultures , as evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis ( Figure Sa and Table 2 ) and markedly reduced PML mRNA expression ( € ) ( Figure 5b ) .
Scrambled oligomer treatment had no effect on expression of either PML protein ( data not shown ) or RNA ( Figure 5b ) .

Functional synergism and molecular interaction of the PML and Rb proteins in normal erythroid progenitor cells The described pattern of PML expression is similar to that previously described for Rb protein along the E and G lineages ( Condorelli et al .
, 1995 ) .
Thus , we investigated a possible physical and functional interaction between PML and Rb in erythroid cells .
« -Rb and « 1-PML oligomers were simultaneously added , at day 5 after growth factor addition , to differentiating HPCs induced to E or G differentiation .
Control cultures were mock treated with equivalent amounts of the scrambled antisense oligomers , « -Rb plus scrambled oligomers or « 1-PML plus scrambled oligomers ( Figure 6 ) .
Expression of both PML and Rb proteins was markedly reduced by this treatment in both culture types ( not shown ) .

To determine whether this synergism is based on a biochemical interaction of these two nuclear proteins in vivo , we performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments of both PML and pRb105 proteins on cell lysates derived from HPCs at a late stage of E or G differentiation ( days 9-11 , Figure 7a and b ) .
Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from HPCs harvested at days 9-11 of E culture , at day 9 of G culture , from Rb*+ K562 cells and Rb- SAOS cells .
Lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-pRb105 or anti-PML mAb ( Figure 7a and b ) .
The anti-Rb immunoprecipitate was loaded onto two separate 8 % SDS-PAGE gels and blotted on membranes .
The two membranes were probed with anti-pRb105 and anti-PML ( PG-M3 ) antibodies , respectively , and then revealed by a chemiolumines-cence procedure ( Figure 7a ) .
Results showed that a major 90 KDa and a minor 70 kDa PML protein co-immunoprecipitate with the Rb protein in late E differentiation ( Figure 7a ) .
No PML/Rb complex was detected in late G differentiation ( Figure 7a ) .
As a control , the filters were stripped and reprobed with the reciprocal antibody , confirming the presence of the PML protein in anti-Rb immunoprecipitates ( data not shown ) .
The PML immunoprecipitate was blotted together with a control anti-Rb immunoprecipitate .
The membrane was probed with an anti-Rb polyclonal Ab ( Figure 7b right panel ) .
PML immunoprecipitates from K562 cells were also evaluated .
This experiment showed that anti-PML immunoprecipitates contain a low amount of a 105 kDa pRb , confirming the presence of a PML/Rb complex in HPCs at day 9 of E culture ( Figure 7b , right panel ) .
The efficiency of PML immunoprecipitation was verified in control experiments where anti-PML immunoprecipitates were blotted and probed with the anti-PML mAb ( PG-M3 ) ( Figure 7b , left panel ) .
The specificity of the PML/Rb complex was controlled by co-immunoprecipitation/ Western blot experiments with PML and GATA-1 ( Labbaye et al .
, 1995 ) .
No PML/GATA-1 complex was detected at day 9 of E culture ( data not shown ) .
Overall these findings indicate the PML protein and a fraction of pRb1O05 specifically interact in day 9 E culture .

We have developed methodology for normal HPC/HSC purification ( Gabbianelli et al .
, 1990 ; Labbaye et al .
, 1994 ) and unilineage differentiation , maturation in liquid-phase suspension culture : this allows a step-by-step analysis of hematopoietic differentiation/maturation through a single lineage at both cellular and molecular levels ( Labbaye et a/ .
, 1994 , 1995 ; Giampaolo et al .
, 1994 ; Condorelli et al .
, 1995 ) .
We have exploited this model system to investigate the pattern of expression and the possible role of several transcription factors in hematopoietic differentiation ( Labbaye et al .
, 1994 , 1995 ; Giampaolo et al .
, 1994 ; Condorelli et al .
, 1995 ) .
The relevance of PML in the physiology of the hematopoietic system is indirectly suggested by its involvement in the pathogenesis of APL as a partner of RAR « in the PML/RAR « fusion protein ( Warrell et al .
, 1993 ; Grignani et al .
, 1994 ; de The et al .
, 1991 ) and is also directly supported by the phenotypic analysis of PML -- mice ( Wang et a/ .
, 1998 ) .
This rearrangement is much more frequently observed as compared with other known APL fusion-proteins , PLZF/RAR « ( Chen et al .
, 1993 ) , NPM/ RAR « ( Redner et al .
, 1996 ) and NuMA-RARa ( Wells et al .
, 1997 ) reported in M3 leukemias .
In addition , PML possesses structural and functional features of a transcription factor ( Kastner et a/ .
, 1992 ; Guiochon-Mantel et al .

The immunoprecipitated materials were analysed by 8 % SDS-PAGE .
After blotting , ( i ) the membrane was first treated with a polyclonal anti-pRb105 ( left panel ) ; as expected , pRb is not detectable in SAOS-2 extracts ; ( ii ) the same membrane was then treated , after stripping , with anti-PML mAb PG-M3 ( right panel ) .
( b ) Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts immunoprecipitated with anti-PML mAb , PG-M3 or with anti-pRb105 mAb , XZ55 , from 4 x 10° day 9 E cells .
The immunoprecipitated materials were analysed by 8 % SDS-PAGE .
After blotting , ( i ) one membrane was treated with anti-PML mAb , PG-M3 , showing two major bands corresponding to the different isoforms ( de The et al .
, 1991 ) at approximately 90 and 70 KDa , respectively ( left panel ) ; ( ii ) a second membrane was treated with anti-pRb105 polyclonal Ab , SC-15 , showing the pRb105 band ( right panel ) both E and G differentiation .
Subsequently , during precursor maturation , PML mRNA and protein expression is maintained in the E series , but is down modulated in the G pathway .
Notably , in another series of experiments , we observed that PML is expressed during megakaryocytic differentiation ( un-published results ) , suggesting that it is specifically suppressed during late G maturation .
The antisense oligomer approach allowed an insight into the possible functional role of PML in the normal hematopoietic differentiation process .
Suppression of PML protein expression in early HPCs ( day 0 of culture ) markedly inhibits both BFU-E and CFU-G colony formation .
This finding suggests that the PML protein is required in early normal hematopoiesis , possibly playing a role in the control of HPC cell cycling .
Subsequently , in more advanced HPCs ( day 5 of culture ) , suppression of PML expression induces a dose dependent inhibition of late BFU-E , but not CFU-G , colony formation .
These data confirm the hypothesis that the PML protein is required for erythroid maturation , but is dispensable for late granulocytic differentiation .
These data are also relevant for the understanding of the biological function of the normal PML protein .
PML is required for both early hematopoiesis and E colony development , and thus can not be regarded simply as a growth controller , but must also have a tissue-specific function in the control of cell cycle and differentiation , possibly through interaction with tissue-specific nuclear proteins .
The modulation of PML expression during HPC differentiation and precursor maturation , is very similar to that described for another nuclear phospho-protein , pRb105 , known as a tumor suppressor ( Condorelli et al .
, 1995 ) .
pRb is a master regulator of cell cycle progression and differentiation ( Chen et a/ .
, 1996a , b and for review see Taya , 1997 ) .
Many of the functions of Rb depend on its association with other proteins .
In this context , several groups have recently documented the apparent role of pRb in terminal cell differentiation through its capacity to directly interact with and activate specific TFs , such as NF-IL6 in monocyte/macrophage precursors ( Chen et al .
, 1996b ) or other members of the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) family in adipocyte culture ( Chen et al .
, 1996a ) .
In the present experiments , separate addition of suboptimal concentrations of « -Rb and « l-PML oligomers slightly inhibited day 0 HPC differentia- 3537 Expression and role of PML and Rb proteins in erythropoiesis C Labbaye et al 3538 tion .
Simultaneous oligomer addition - completely blocked E , but not G maturation , in day 5 E and G cultures .
This effect seems to be synergistic , suggesting that PML and Rb cooperate in the regulation of erythropoiesis .
The functional interaction between PML and Rb may consist in a coordinate activity of the two proteins on the same molecular pathways .
However , pRb105 co-immunoprecipitates with the PML protein from erythroid precursors , suggesting that the biological effect of the functional PML and Rb knock-out may derive from the decrease of a proteic complex containing both PML and Rb .
Indeed , using cell lines , we have recently demonstrated and mapped the physical PML/Rb interaction within PML-NBs : interestingly , PML can modulate RB activity on the glycocorticoid receptor gene promoter ( Alcalay et al .
, 1998 ) .
The co-immunoprecipitation experiments shown here were performed in normal cells and did not involve overexpression of the interacting proteins , supporting the notion of the existence of a physiological PML/Rb complex in normal cells .
We observed PML/Rb coimmunoprecipitation only after a long exposure of the membranes .
This finding indicates that the amount of PML-Rb complex in erythroblasts accounts for a small proportion of the total pRb protein , which may localize within the PML NBs ( Alcalay et al .
, 1998 ) .
The specific function of the interacting subfractions of the two proteins is presently unknown , but it may consist in the formation of specific protein-protein interactions .
Our finding that PML and Rb are required for erythroid differentiation , and that the two proteins physically interact in maturing erythroid cells , provides the first evidence for a functional role of the PML/Rb complex , specifically in normal hematopoiesis .
Materials and methods Hematopoietic growth factors and cell culture Recombinant human growth factors were obtained from standard commercial sources ( Gabbianelli et al .
, 1990 ; Labbaye et al .
, 1994 , 1995 ; Giampaolo et al .
, 1994 ) .
Iscove 's medium ( IMDM , GIBCO ) was freshly prepared weekly .
Cell lines used as controls for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments ( K562 , Jurkat , SAOS-2 , U937-PML3 ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) .
Adult peripheral blood ( PB ) HPC purification and clonogenetic assay HPCs were purified from the PB buffy coat according to the method previously reported ( Gabbianelli et a/ .
, 1990 ) and subsequently modified as described ( Giampaolo et al .
, 1994 ; Labbaye et al .
, 1995 ) .
Purified HPC clonogenetic cultures FCS~- were supplemented with IL-3 ( 100 U/ml ) , GM-CSF ( 10 ng/m ! )
in presence or not of Epo ( 3 U ) in order to obtain CFU-GM colonies or BFU-E plus CFU-GM colonies ( Labbaye et al .
, 1995 ) .
HPC erythroid ( E ) and granulopoietic ( G ) liquid suspension culture Step IIIP HPCs were seeded ( 5 x 10° cells per ml ) and grown in liquid FCS~- medium ( Valtieri et a/ .
, 1989 ) supplemented in E culture with low doses of IL-3 ( 0.01 U/ml ! )
and GM-CSF ( 0.001 ng ) and a saturating level of Epo ( 3 U ) and in G culture with low amounts of IL-3 ( 1 U ) and GM-CSF ( 0.1 ng ) and a saturating amount of G-CSF ( 10 ng ) as described ( Labbaye et al .
, 1995 ) .
Cells were incubated in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO , /5 % 0 , /90 % N , and were periodically counted and analysed for morphology , membrane phenotype , and PML gene expression .
Cell surface marker and morphology analysis To evaluate the differentiation of HPCs differentiating along the E and G lineages the cells were labeled with the following monoclonal antibodies labeled either with FITC or PE : anti-CD34 , anti-CD15 , anti-CDlla and anti-Glycophorin A ( Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA ) .
Fluorescent cells were analysed with a flow cytometer ( FACS Scan , Becton Dickinson , San Diego , CA , USA ) .
For cell morphology analysis cytospin preparations of cells were performed at different days of culture and stained with May-Griinwald-Giemsa .
At least 200 cells were examined and classified according to their differentiation/maturation stage .
Morphology and immunofluorescence analysis Cells were harvested on different days , smeared on glass slides by cytospin centrifugation , and stained with May-Griinwald-Giemsa .
The anti-PML mAb PG-M3 ( Flenghi et al .
, 1995 ) was used for immunofluorescence labeling of PML .
Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described ( Grignani et al .
, 1996 ) .
Cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope ( Microphot , Nikon ) equipped with a highly sensitive videocamera and a system for digital images acquisition .
Reverse transcriptase ( RT-PCR ) mRNA analysis The method for semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis has been reported ( Labbaye et al .
, 1994 , 1995 , Giampaolo et al .
, 1994 ) .
cDNAs were normalized by the B2-microglobulin gene ( Labbaye et al .
, 1995 ) .
K562 cell line was used as an internal positive control .
An aliquot of RT-RNA ( 20 ng ) from each sample and a mock reaction ( negative controls ) were amplified to exclude the presence of contaminant DNA .
PML primers and probe were as follows : PML-sense 5- ( TTC GGA GGA GGA GTT CCA ) -3 ( from 219-237 ) ; a-sense PML : 5- ( GTG TGC CTC GAA GCA CTT ) -3 ' ( from 527-545 ) ; internal probe : 5- ( CTAGGTGCAGACACACCC-GCCCT ) -3 ' ( from 368-391 ) ( de Thé et al .
, 1991 ) .
The amplification procedure included denaturation at 95°C for 30 s , annealing at 56°C for 30 s , and extension at 72°C for 45 s during 30 PCR cycles , ie .
, within the range of linear amplification this cycle number allowed a linear cDNA dose response .
In control experiments , serial dilutions of samples were amplified ; the dose-response curves showed linearity for all points ( not shown ) .
Relative intensities of bands were quantified by scanning with a laser densitometer ( Phosphor-imager Molecular Dynamics Inc. ; Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) .
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis Proteins were extracted from HPCs ( 4 x 10° ) collected at day 9 and 12 from E and G cultures ( Condorelli et al .
, 1995 ) and analysed by Western blot as described in Grignani et a/ .
( 1996 ) .
Samples were normalized for cell number and loaded onto 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
K562 cell line and U937-PML3 ( U937 cells stably transfected with the PML3 cDNA ( Flenghi et al .
, 1995 ) ) were used as positive controls .
The anti-PML mAb PG-M3 ( Flenghi et al .
, 1995 ) was used to probe the blotted membrane for PML .
Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) .
HPC oligomer treatment and clonogenetic assay Oligomer treatment was performed as described in Labbaye et al .
( 1995 ) .
We have used two sets of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides in our experiments .

Expression and role of PML and Rb proteins in erythropoiesis C Labbaye et al treated at day 0 with « 1-PML or scrambled « 1-PML ( Ser al-PML ) .
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis Nuclear extract preparation - Nuclear extracts , prepared as described ( Snow et al .
, 1987 ) were normalized for cell number from 4x 10° HPCs collected at day 9 and 11 of E culture , at day 9 of G culture , or from 2x 10° cells from different cell lines ( K562 and Jurkat , for positive controls of PML and Rb proteins expression , respectively ; SAOS-2 for negative control of Rb protein expression ) .
Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously ( Snow et al .
, 1987 ) with ( i ) anti-PML mAb , PG-M3 used at 1/50 dilution ( Flenghi et a/ .
, 1995 ) ; or with ( ii ) anti-pRb105 mAb used at 1/1000 dilution ( Condorelli et a/ .
, 1995 ) .
Several controls were performed with nuclear extracts prepared from day 9 E culture : ( i ) immunoprecipitation of the transcription factor hGATA-1 ( Labbaye et al .
, 1995 ) , using the anti- hGATA-1 mAb ( Santa Cruz ) , to assay the specificity of the PML /pRb complex ; ( ii ) addition of IgG or beads alone to evaluate background in the immunoprecipitation procedure ( data not shown ) .
Western blot analysis Immune complex samples were prepared in duplicate and loaded onto two different 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels .
Blotted membranes were probed : ( i ) first , with anti-PML mAb , PG-M3 diluted 1/500 or with the anti-pRb105 polyclonal antibody , SC-15 ( Santa Cruz ) diluted 1/5000 .
( ii ) After stripping , the membrane first treated with anti-PML , was reprobed with anti-pRb105 polyclonal Ab , SC-15 and the membrane first treated with the anti-pRb105 was reprobed with anti-PML mAb .
Blots were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) .
