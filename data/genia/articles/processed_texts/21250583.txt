Localized pancreatic NF-kB activation and inflammatory response in taurocholate-induced pancreatitis .
Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 280 : G1197-G1208 , 2001.-Transcription factor nuclear factor-kB ( NF- « B ) is activated in cerulein pancreatitis and mediates cytokine expression .
The role of transcription factor activation in other models of pancreatitis has not been established .
Here we report upregulation of NF-kB and inflammatory molecules , and their correlation with local pancreatic injury , in a model of severe pancreatitis .
Rats received intraductal infusion of taurocholate or saline , and the pancreatic head and tail were analyzed separately .
NF- « kB and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) activation were assessed by gel shift assay , and mRNA expression of interleukin-6 , tumor necrosis factor- « , KC , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 , and inducible nitric oxide synthase was assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR .
Morphological damage and trypsin activation were much greater in the pancreatic head than tail , in parallel with a stronger activation of NF- « B and cytokine mRNA .
Saline infusion mildly affected these parameters .
AP-1 was strongly activated in both pancreatic segments after either taurocholate or saline infusion .
NF- « B inhibition with N-acetylcysteine ameliorated the local inflammatory response .
Correlation between localized NF-kB activation , cytokine upregulation , and tissue damage suggests a key role for NF-kB in the development of the inflammatory response of acute pancreatitis .
acute pancreatitis ; nuclear factor-kB ; activator protein-1 ; cy-tokines ; chemokines ; inducible nitric oxide synthase ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISM OF acute pancreatitis has not been established , there is emerging evidence that upregulation of inflammatory mediators , such as cytokines , chemokines , adhesion molecules , and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , is central to the process ( for recent reviews , see Refs .
6 , 36 , and 43 ) .
Upregulation of these molecules has been shown in human ( 5 , 20 , 24 , 28 ) and experimental pancreatitis ( 11 , 12 , 16 , 17 , 38 , 39 , 41 , 48 , 52 ) , and their role in the disease has been demonstrated by using pharmacological inhibitors or antagonists ( 17 , 21 , 35 , 37 , 41 , 47 ) , neutralizing antibodies ( 16 , 38 , 48 , 52 ) , and genetic approaches ( 7 , 8 , 12 ) .
The cellular mechanism of regulation of these inflammatory molecules involves activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor ( 8 , 14 , 51 ) and activator protein ( AP ) -1 ( 50 ) .
Activation of in the pancreas has recently been demonstrated in rat cerulein pancreatitis ( 17 , 44 ) .
Inhibition of NF- « B activation resulted in a decrease in the expression of cytokines KC [ rat analog of interleukin ( IL ) -8/Gro- « ] and IL-6 ( 17 ) .
NF- < B and AP-1 represent two early response tran-seriptional complexes essential for the gene expression of inflammatory molecules ( 3 , 14 , 15 , 50 ) .
NF-KB exists as a complex of homo- or heterodimers composed of members of the Rel family of proteins ( 3 , 14 ) .
In most resting cells , NF- « B is sequestered within the cytoplasm in an inactive form .
After activation , NF-kB complexes translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription from target genes .
AP-1 represents a homo- or heterodimer complex composed of Jun , Fos , or activating transcription factor subunits ( 22 , 49 ) .
These components normally reside in the nucleus and after stimulation bind to phorbol ester- or cAMP-responsive sites on DNA , inducing gene expression .
The involvement of the inflammatory molecules and their regulation has mostly been investigated in rat cerulein-induced pancreatitis , a model with mild severity ( 1 , 26 ) .
To establish a universal role for these mechanisms in the development of pancreatitis , we designed the present set of experiments in a model of pancreatitis induced in rats by the taurocholate biliopancreatic duct infusion .
This model is associated with severe pancreatic necrosis and a high mortality ( 2 , 27 ) .
We analyzed early molecular events , namely activation of inflammatory molecules [ IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - « , KC , monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) -1 , and iNOS ] and the transcription factors involved in their regulation ( NF- < B and AP-1 ) .
In the taurocholate model , pancreatic damage is mainly localized to the head of the pancreas , whereas in cerulein-induced pancreatitis and other models the Address for reprint requests and other correspondence : E. Vaquero , VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System , West Los Angeles , Bldg .

G1198 damage is evenly distributed throughout the organ .
Taking advantage of this characteristic of taurocholate-induced pancreatitis , we studied the early molecular events separately in the pancreatic head and tail and correlated them with the local morphological and biochemical changes ( e.g .
, neutrophil infiltration and trypsin activation ) .
Furthermore , because several factors ( chemical and mechanical effect , oxidative stress , ischemia-reperfusion ; see Refs .
2 , 25 , 31 , 45 ) are involved in the mechanism of this model , we investigated the pancreatic response to saline intraductal infusion , in which the trigger is restricted to increased hydrostatic pressure .
Characterization of the injury induced by saline infusion may have a direct clinical implication for understanding the acute pancreatitis that some patients develop as a complication of the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( 18 , 29 ) .
We found localized activation of NF-kB ( but not AP-1 ) and localized upregulation of inflammatory molecules in the pancreatic head .
These molecular changes correlated with the severity of morphological changes , including inflammatory cell infiltration , and with trypsin activation .
Moreover , pharmacological blockade of NF- « B activation resulted in attenuation of the local inflammatory response .
Saline infusion caused , although to a lesser degree , characteristic morphological changes of pancreatitis and NF-kB and AP-1 activation and upregulation of inflammatory molecules .
The results indicate that taurocholate infusion causes a localized activation of NF- < B that , in turn , upregulates the expression of inflammatory molecules .
These signals may be important for the infiltration of inflammatory cells and localized parenchymal damage in pancreatitis .

Other reagents were from Sigma Chemical ( St. Louis , MO ) .
Experimental Procedure Care and handling of the animals were approved by the Animal Research Committee of the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System , in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines .
Male Sprague-Dawley rats ( Harlan , Madison , WI ) , weighing 300-340 g , were random NF-KB ACTIVATION IN TAUROCHOLATE PANCREATITIS ized into different groups and fasted overnight before the experiment .
Acute taurocholate pancreatitis was induced according to Aho et al .
( 2 ) .
Under a combination of xylazine ( 10 mg/kg ) and ketamine ( 100 mg/kg ) anesthesia , a midline lap-arotomy was performed and a PE-50 catheter ( inside diameter 0.58 mm , outside diameter 0.96 mm ) was inserted in the pancreatic duct through a puncture of the duodenum .
The biliopancreatic duct was occluded transiently by a silk ligature at the liver hilus to prevent regurgitation of the infusate into the liver .
Sodium taurocholate solution ( 0.4 ml of 4 % ; TC group ) or the same volume of saline ( saline group ) was retrogradely infused in the pancreatic duct at a flow rate of 0.07 ml/min by a microinfusion pump .
At the completion of the infusion , the catheter and hilar ligature were removed and the abdomen was closed with suture .
Intact rats served as a control ( control group ) .
To inhibit NF-kB activation , rats from the TC group received , in addition , an intravenous bolus of 200 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) in saline 2 h before intraductal infusion of taurocholate , followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of NAC ( 25 mg-kg 'th ' ) .
Controls received an intravenous saline infusion at the same rate .
These groups of rats were killed 6 h after taurocholate ad-ministration .
At 1 or 6 h after taurocholate infusion , animals were killed by CO ; asphyxiation and blood was obtained in heparinized tubes for amylase and lipase determinations .
Portions of the pancreas were immediately removed , trimmed of fat , rinsed in ice-cold PBS , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at -80°C until processing for active trypsin measurements , nuclear protein extraction , and RNA isolation .
Portions of the gland were also saved for morphological examination .
Specimens of the head and tail segments of the pancreas were collected and analyzed separately .
For histological examina-tion , fresh pancreatic tissue was fixed in 10 % zinc-buffered formalin , embedded in paraffin , and cut into 3- to 5-pm-thick sections .
For immunostaining , 2- to 4-mm pieces of pancreas were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( pH 7.4 ) at 4°C for 2 h and dehydrated in an increasing gradient of sucrose solutions ( 0.5 , 1 , and 2.3 M ) at 4°C .
Next , the tissue was frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT and stored at -80°C .
Immunohistochemistry For immunohistochemical detection of neutrophils , 8-um-thick cryosections were mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides .
After being washed with PBS for 5 min and then with PBS containing 0.05 M glycine ( PBS/glycine ) for 10 min , sections were incubated in a blocking medium containing PBS/glycine , 1 % ( vol/vol ) goat serum , 1 % ( wt/vol ) BSA , and 1 % ( wt/vol ) gelatin .
After 20 min , tissue sections were transferred to working medium ( PBS/glycine , 0.1 % goat serum , 0.1 % BSA , and 0.1 % gelatin ) for 10 min followed by a 2-h incubation with rabbit anti-rat polymorphonuclear leukocyte antibody conjugated with FITC at 1:125 dilution .
The sections were then washed three times with PBS and air dried .
Anti-fading mixture ( 4 % propyl gallate and 90 % glycerol in PBS , pH 7.8 ) was added , and the FITC-stained neutrophils were imaged by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Dia-phot microscope .
For p65 immunolocalization , paraffin sections and the ABC Peroxidase Staining Kit were used .
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by tissue incubation in 0.3 % HO in methanol for 30 min .
Slides were washed with PBS for 5 min and then with PBS containing 0.05 M glycine for 10 min .
Sections were blocked in the blocking medium for 20 min , washed for 10 min in the working medium , and incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-p65 antibody at 1:50 dilution .

NF-KB ACTIVATION IN TAUROCHOLATE PANCREATITIS Slides were then washed with PBS three times for 10 min and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in the working buffer ( 1:200 ) .
Sections were washed with PBS/glycine buffer and incubated with ABC peroxidase reagent for 30 min , then washed with PBS/glycine buffer three times for 10 min , incubated with diaminobenzidine substrate and H2Osz , washed in PBS/glycine buffer three times for 10 min , and examined by light microscopy .
The specificity of p65 staining was confirmed by the use of secondary reagents , omitting the primary antibody .
Values were obtained by counting the number of neutrophils ( or the number of acinar cell nuclei immunoreactive for p65 ) per 100 acinar cells .
An average of 100 fields was counted for neutrophils , and an average of 20 fields was counted for p65 immunolocalization from four to six rats for each condition .
Assays Measurement of active trypsin .
Trypsin activity in pancreatic tissue homogenates was measured by a fluorimetric assay according to the method of Kawabata et al .
( 28 ) .
Briefly , the tissue was homogenized on ice in 3 vol of a buffer containing 5 mM MES ( pH 6.5 ) , 1 mM MgSO « , and 250 mM sucrose using a glass-Teflon homogenizer .
A aliquot of the homogenate was added to 2 ml of the assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris ( pH 8.0 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaC ) ls , and 0.1 mg/ml BSA in a stirred cuvette at 37°C .
The reaction was started by adding the Boc-Glu-Ala-Arg-AMC substrate and was followed for 5 min .
The increase in fluorescence ( excita-tion 380 nm , emission 440 nm ) was linear during the obser-vation .
Trypsin activity in the homogenate was calculated using a standard curve for purified trypsin obtained by the same procedure .
Preparation of nuclear extracts .
Nuclear protein extracts from pancreatic tissue were prepared for gel shift assay as described earlier ( 17 , 39 ) .
Briefly , 100-200 mg of frozen tissue were powdered in a mortar in liquid nitrogen and lysed in 1 ml of a low-salt buffer ( 17 ) with 20 strokes in a glass Dounce homogenizer .
Before use , the lysis buffer was supplemented with phenylmethylsulfony ] l fluoride ( PMSF ) and di-thiothreitol ( DTT ) to a final concentration of 1 mM each and with the protease-inhibitor cocktail containing 5 ug/ml each of pepstatin , leupeptin , chymostatin , antipain , and aprotinin .
After 20 min , 10 % Igepal CA-630 was added to a final concentration of 0.8 % ( vol/vol ) , and then nuclei were collected by 30 s microcentrifugation .
Nuclear protein was extracted from pelleted nuclei in a high-salt buffer ( 17 ) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM DTT , and the protease inhibitor cocktail described previously for up to 1 h at 4°C .
Nuclear membranes were pelleted by microcentrifugation for 10 min , and the clear supernatant ( nuclear extract ) was separated into ali-quots and stored at -80°C .
The protein content of the nuclear extract was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) experiments were performed using double-stranded oligonucleotides comprising the consensus sequences ( underlined ) for NF-kB ( 5'-GCAGAGGGGACTT-TCCGAGA ) and AP-1 ( 5'-GGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA ) .
The binding site for AP-1 comprised the phorbol ester-re-sponsive element .
Oligonucleotides were end labeled with [ P°P ] dCTP using Klenow DNA polymerase I .
In the mutated NF-xB oligonucleotide , the xB motif was changed to GGeceAC-TaaCC .
Nuclear proteins ( 7-10 ug ) were incubated with the °°P-labeled oligonucleotide probe under binding conditions [ 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.8 ) , 50 mM KCl , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM G1199 DTT , 10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol , and 3 ug poly ( dI-dC ) ] for 20 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 pl .
For cold competition , a 100X molar excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutated oligonucleotides was added with the probe .
For supershift experiments , 2-4 pg of specific antibodies against NF- « B proteins p65 ( Rel A ) , p50 , p52 , and c-Rel or against AP-1 proteins c-Fos , c-Jun , Jun-B , Jun-D , and Fra-2 were incubated with the binding reaction mixture for 40 min at room temperature before addition of the probe .
After binding , protein-DNA complexes were electrophoresed on a native 4.5 % polyacrylamide gel at 200 volts using 0.5 % TBE buffer ( 1xx TBE : 89 mM Tris base , 89 mM boric acid , and 2 mM EDTA ) .
After being dried , the gels were quantified in the PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression .
The procedure for semiquantitative RT-PCR was essentially as described previously ( 17 , 39 ) .
Total RNA was extracted from pancreatic tissue using the TRIzol reagent .
RNA quality was verified by ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNA bands on denaturing agarose gel .
Total RNA ( 5 ug ) was reverse-transcribed using oligo ( dT ) as a primer ( SuperScript II Preamplification System ) .
cDNA obtained from 0.5 ug total RNA was subjected to PCR using rat gene-specific primers for IL-6 , TNF- « , KC , MCP-1 , and iNOS .
The primer sequences were described previously ( 17 , 39 ) .
Amplification was for a different number of cycles ( between 22 and 32 ) to yield visible products within the linear amplification range .
For a given target sequence , the same cycle number was applied for cDNAs from all animals studied .
Negative controls were performed by omitting the RT step or the cDNA template from PCR amplification .
The identity of the RT-PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing .
They were separated on an agarose gel containing ethidium bromide , photographed , and quantified using an AMBIS image analysis system ( Scanalytics , San Diego , CA ) .
Background correction in the densitometry was performed using an area immediately adjacent to the RT-PCR product band .
mRNA levels were normalized to the density of the RT-PCR product for acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO ( ARP ) , used as a housekeeping gene , in the same sample , as we described previously ( 17 , 89 ) .
Statistical Analysis Data are presented as means + SE of the values .
Statistical differences between values from two groups were determined by the unpaired Student 's é-test .
For normally distributed parameters , differences between more than two groups were determined by one-way ANOVA , and multiple comparisons were performed by using Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis .
For parameters without normal distribution , differences between more than two groups were determined by the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn 's post hoe analysis .
A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
RESULTS Macroscopic and Histological Examination of the Pancreas Rats that received intraductal infusion of saline showed slight pancreatic edema , and light microscopy revealed a mild degree of interstitial edema .
By contrast , after 1 or 6 h of taurocholate infusion , all of the animals had severe necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis , observed grossly and by light microscopy , that mostly affected the head segment of the pancreas .
The pancreatic tail had normal histology in most of the animals .

Parameters of Pancreatitis : Serum Amylase and Lipase , Pancreatic Neutrophil Infiltration , and Trypsin Activation Figure 1 shows the levels of serum amylase and lipase and the infiltration of neutrophils in pancreatic tissue in untreated rats and in those at 1 or 6 h after receiving intraductal infusion of either saline or taurocholate .
Animals infused with taurocholate showed a time-dependent increase of serum amylase and lipase that was already significant after 1 h of the infusion .
Intraductal saline infusion induced a smaller increase in serum amylase and lipase that was significantly higher compared with the control group .
The number of infiltrating neutrophils in the pancreatic head of taurocholate-infused rats followed a similar time-dependent pattern as the amylase and lipase levels .
The number of neutrophils in the pancreatic head increased also in the 6-h saline group , but to a lesser extent .
In control pancreata , no inflammatory infiltration was seen ( Fig .
1C ) .
Trypsin activation was also evaluated separately in the pancreatic head and tail ( Fig .
2 ) .
In the head of the pancreas , trypsin activity increased at 1 h and then further at 6 h after taurocholate infusion .
The saline treatment induced a smaller increase that was statistically significant in the 6-h saline group compared with control and 1-h saline groups .
Trypsin activity in the pancreatic tail after taurocholate infusion showed a much smaller increase than in the head ( P < 0.05 ) and was not statistically different from the control group .
Activation of Pancreatic NF-kB in Taurocholate-Induced Pancreatitis In the pancreas of normal rats , DNA binding activity of was virtually undetectable .
As shown in Fig .
3 , taurocholate infusion caused a time-dependent NF- < B activation in the pancreatic head .
The course of NF- « B activation paralleled that of serum amylase and lipase levels and neutrophil infiltration , with the highest increase ( 5-fold over the control group ) detected 6 h after the taurocholate infusion ( Fig .
3B ) .
Saline infu- sion caused minor NF- < B activation .
The specificity of NF- « B binding activity was demonstrated by cold competition experiments using wild-type and mutated B oligonucleotides ( Fig .
44 ) .
Only wild-type , and not mu-tated , xB oligonucleotide competed with the probe for the NF- « B DNA binding .
Composition of NF-kB Complexes NF-KB exists as homo- or heterodimer composed of members of the NF- « B/Re !

To characterize complexes activated in taurocholate pancreatitis , nuclear extracts from the pancreatic head of 6-h taurocholate-infused animals were analyzed in supershift experiments using antibodies against p65 ( Rel A ) , p50 , p52 , or c-Rel .
As shown in Fig .

clear supershift .
The presence of p52 or of c-Rel was not detected by the supershift assay .
These data indicate that p65 and p50 proteins are present in the NF- « kB complexes activated in taurocholate pancreatitis .
To further analyze cellular localization of the activated NF- « B , we performed immunostaining in pancreatic tissue with a specific antibody to p65 .
NF- « B is A Fig .

Data are representative of 2 animals .
kept in inactive form in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus upon activation .
Thus immunostained nuclei indicate the presence of the activated NF- « B .
In accordance with EMSA data , p65 immunoreactivity in the cell nuclei was not observed in control pancreas ( Fig .
5A ) .
In contrast , pancreatic tissue from the 6-h taurocholate group , in which a strong NF- « B activation was detected by EMSA , displayed immunostained nu-clei , confirming the activation of NF- « B ( Fig .
5B ) .
In both control and pancreatitis tissue , no staining was observed without primary antibody ( data not shown ) .
Most of immunoreactivity was confined to the acinar cell population , and ~10 % of the acinar cell nuclei stained for p65 ( Fig .
5B ) .
A small portion of infiltrated neutrophils also showed nuclear p65 localization ( Fig .
5C ) .
Activation of Pancreatic AP-1 Complexes in Taurocholate-Induced Pancreatitis In the pancreas of normal rats , there was essentially no AP-1 DNA binding activity .
As shown in Fig .
6 , AP-1 was strongly activated in pancreata from rats at 1 and 6 h after infusion of either saline or taurocholate .
Thus , compared with NF-kB , pancreatic AP-1 activation developed faster .
Also , the induction of AP-1 binding activity in both saline- and taurocholate-infused animals was stronger than that for NF- « B ( Fig .
6B ) .
The specificity of AP-1 binding was confirmed in cold competition experiments ( Fig .
7A ) using unlabeled wild-type or unrelated ( Oct-1 ) oligonucleotide .

In C , double arrowhead indicates a leukocyte positively stained for nuclear p65 ; double arrow points to a leukocyte not stained for nuclear p65 .
AP-1 is a dimeric transcription factor that consists of homodimers of the Jun family proteins ( c-Jun , Jun-B , and Jun-D ) or Jun/Fos heterodimers .
Members of the Fos family ( c-Fos , Fos-B , Fra-1 , and Fra-2 ) can associate with different Jun proteins to form the heterodimeric AP-1 complexes .
The composition of AP-1 complexes in pancreata of taurocholate-infused animals was determined by supershift analysis using antibodies against Jun or Fos proteins ( Fig .
7B ) .
A supershifted band was detected with c-Fos , Jun-B , and Fra-2 antibodies .
The addition of Jun-B antibody also caused a significant decrease of the specific AP-1 band ( Fig .

c-Jun , Jun-D , and Fos-B did not demonstrate a clear supershift or intensity decrease of the AP-1 band .
Thus the results obtained indicate the presence of c-Fos , Jun-B , and Fra-2 in AP-1 complex ( es ) activated in the pancreas of taurocholate-infused rats .

In comparison , an increase of iNOS mRNA expression was delayed , showing upregulation at 6 h. A particularly dramatic increase ( > 100-fold ) was observed for KC mRNA at 6 h after taurocholate infusion .
In contrast , we did not detect significant changes in TNF-a expression after taurocholate infusion .
Saline infusion , although to a lesser degree than taurocholate infusion , also increased mRNA expression for IL-6 , KC , and MCP-1 .
At 1 h , the saline-induced upregulation of IL-6 and MCP-1 was comparable to that induced by taurocholate infusion .
Regional Activation of NF-kB , AP-1 , and Inflammatory Molecule Gene Expression in the Pancreas Morphological observations ( this study and Refs .
31 and 46 ) show that retrograde intraductal infusion of taurocholate causes severe tissue damage in the head of the pancreas with preservation of the pancreatic tail .
This characteristic of the model led us to investigate whether the early molecular responses displayed a similar localized profile .
Representative specimens of each segment ( head or tail ) from the same pancreas were collected and analyzed separately by EMSA and RT-PCR .
As shown in Fig .
9A , NF- « B activation was much stronger in the head segment than in the corresponding tail at both 1 and 6 h after taurocholate infusion .
This localized activation paralleled the more intense morphological damage , neutrophil infiltration , and trypsin activation detected in the same pancreatic segment ( Fig .
2 ) .
By contrast , AP-1 showed a similar increase in DNA binding activity in the head and in the tail after taurocholate infusion ( Fig .
9B ) .

Similarly , the mRNA expression for IL-6 , MCP-1 , iNOS ( Fig .
9C ) , and KC ( data not shown ) also displayed a localized response , with strong upregulation in the head of the pancreas contrasting the absent or weak expression in the corresponding tail segment .
Abrogation of the Local Inflammatory Response in Taurocholate-Induced Pancreatitis by NF-kB Inhibition To determine the role of NF- < B in the inflammatory response of taurocholate pancreatitis , rats were treated with an NF-kB inhibitor , the antioxidant NAC ( 15 , 17 , 51 ) .
NF- « B activation and mRNA expression of inflammatory molecules were measured in pancreatic head specimens collected 6 h after taurocholate infusion in rats treated with NAC or vehicle .
As shown in Fig .
10A , NAC clearly suppressed pancreatic NF-kB activation caused by taurocholate infusion .
NAC inhibited NF- « xB activation by > 50 % ( Fig .
10B ) .
Blockade of NF- « B activation markedly ameliorated the following parameters of the local inflammatory response : neutrophil infiltration ( Fig .
10C ) and mRNA expression of IL-6 , KC , and iNOS ( Fig .
10D ) .
However , NAC treatment did not change serum amylase and lipase levels at 6 h after taurocholate infusion ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION There is emerging consensus that inflammatory mediators ( cytokines , in particular ) play a central role in the development of experimental acute pancreatitis ( 6 , 36 , 43 ) .
Recently , NF- « kB has been identified as an important regulator that controls the expression of many of those inflammatory mediators in the pancreas ( 9 , 17 , 19 , 39 , 44 , 52 ) .
These molecular events have been studied in more detail in the rat cerulein model of pancreatitis .
Administration of the CCK analog cerulein in rats causes a very reproducible but mild form of pancreatitis limited to changes in the pancreas , without major systemic complications or lethality ( 1 , 26 ) .
By contrast , taurocholate infusion into the rat biliopancreatic duct is associated with severe local pan Downloaded from www.physiclogy.org/journal/ajpgi ( 173.236.240.127 ) on May 10 , 2019 .
G1204 creatic damage ( edema , necrosis , hemorrhage , and abundant leukocyte infiltration ) , major systemic com-plications , and high mortality ( 2 ) .
This model closely reproduces the necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis in humans ( 27 ) .
In the present study , we chose the taurocholate-induced pancreatitis model to investigate whether the above-described molecular events are common between different experimental models and , Time 1 hour 6 hours are .

In addition to NF- < B , we also studied AP-1 , another important transcription factor in the early inflammatory response ( 15 , 50 ) .
Because in the taurocholate model the damage is mostly localized to the pancreatic head , we asked whether activation of transcription factors and inflammatory molecules correlated with parameters of pancreatitis .
Finally , we analyzed responses to the mechanical effect of saline intraductal infusion .
Morphologically , taurocholate infusion caused severe pancreatic damage in the head of the pancreas , evident at both 1 and 6 h after the infusion .
This was accompanied by a progressive increase in serum amylase and lipase , pancreatic neutrophil infiltration , and trypsin activation in the head segment of the gland .
After a parallel time course , NF- « B was rapidly activated in the pancreatic head , with increasing activation at 6 h after taurocholate infusion .
These observations extend previous findings of early pancreatic activation in the rat cerulein model ( 17 , 44 ) and in pancreatitis induced by occlusion of the pancreatic duct ( 9 ) .
In those studies , NF- « B activation was detected within the first 15 min of cerulein induction ( 17 , 44 ) and 1 h after pancreatic duct occlusion ( 9 ) .
NF- < B activation has also been reported in peritoneal and alveolar macrophages from rats with taurocholate-induced pancreatitis ( 42 ) .
With the supershift assay , we showed that p65 ( Rel A ) and p50 subunits are present in the activated NF- < B complexes in taurocholate pancreatitis .
We im-munolocalized the translocated p65 subunit to the acinar cell nuclei .
p65 translocation into acinar cell nuclei has been also observed in the cerulein model ( 44 ) .
Although neutrophil infiltration into the pancreas was abundant 6 h after taurocholate infusion , the immunostaining revealed that the main source of nuclear p65 was the acinar cells .
This suggests that NF- « B activation in the acinar cells represents a primary event in the early phase of acute pancreatitis .
The finding of pancreatic NF-kB activation in several experimental models of pancreatitis indicates that NF- < B activation may be an important common mechanism in the development of acute pancreatitis .
We observed a strong AP-1 response already at 1 h after taurocholate infusion .
However , in contrast to NF- « B , AP-1 binding activity in the pancreas did not Fig .

Different homo- and heterodimeric AP-1 complexes can differently regulate transcription of target genes ( 50 ) .
Our supershift assay demonstrated the presence of c-Fos , Jun-B , and Fra-2 in the AP-1 complexes activated in response to taurocholate infusion .
AP-1 activation in the pancreas has not been described previ-ously .
So far , two studies reported pancreatic induction of the protoncogenes c-fos and c-jun during cerulein-induced pancreatitis in mice ( 13 ) and rats ( 10 ) .
The role of the different AP-1 subunits we found activated in taurocholate pancreatitis in the expression of genes mediating the inflammatory response remains to be determined .
We measured the pancreatic mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 and TNF-a ) , chemo-kines ( KC and MCP-1 ) , and iNOS in saline- and taurocholate-infused rats .
Promoters of all of these genes contain binding sites for NF- « kB and AP-1 ( 4 , 38 , 34 , 40 ) .

G1206 associated with an early upregulation in the head of the pancreas of all the mediators studied except TNF-a .
Because TNF-a induction has been reported for other models of pancreatitis ( 9 , 13 , 16 , 38 ) , this finding may be dependent on the specific characteristics of taurocholate-induced pancreatitis .
It also may be that TNF-a activation in this model is delayed beyond the 6-h observation period .
Of particular interest is the strong upregulation we observed for the chemokine KC , a potent neutrophil chemoattractant ( 80 ) .
In contrast to other experimental models of acute pancreatitis , in which the pancreas is entirely affected , the intraductal infusion of taurocholate renders a regional affectation mostly limited to the pancreatic head .
Such localized damage is an inherent characteristic of this model .
This and previous studies ( 25 , 31 , 45 , 46 ) show more pronounced morphological injury ; , microcirculatory changes , trypsin activation , and neutrophil infiltration in the pancreatic head than in the tail .
In this study , we found a localized activation of NF- « B and expression of inflammatory molecules in the pancreatic head .
The correlation between regional activation of NF- « B ( and the cytokines regulated by NF- « B ) and the parameters that reflect pancreatic damage adds new evidence to the key role of this transcription factor in tissue injury .
In contrast to NF- < B , there was not much difference in AP-1 activation between the pancreatic head and tail .
Also , the increase in AP-1-binding activity was similar in saline-and taurocholate-infused rats .
This suggests that , although AP-1 may be necessary for the full activation of specific inflammatory molecules , it is not sufficient by itself to do so .
To establish whether the changes observed in taurocholate-induced pancreatitis were dependent on NF-KB activity , we used the NF-kB inhibitor NAC .
This antioxidant is well known to inhibit NF- « B activation in vivo ( 15 , 17 , 51 ) .
In agreement with what we previously reported for cerulein pancreatitis ( 17 ) , NAC markedly inhibited NF- « B activation in the 6 h of taurocholate pancreatitis , with significant amelioration of the local inflammatory response ( neutrophil infiltration and expression of inflammatory molecules ) .
This finding supports the idea that NF- < B activation is a key event in triggering the local cascade of inflammatory mediators associated with acute pancreatitis .
NAC did not affect serum amylase and lipase levels at 6 h after taurocholate infusion .
This finding may be explained by the multifactorial nature of pancreatic injury associated with the taurocholate model , one of the factors being `` mechanical `` injury .
Once the integrity of the panere-atic tissue is disrupted by the direct action of the taurocholic bile salt , pancreatic enzymes may reach the circulation independently of any mechanism regulating the inflammatory process .
The absence of such mechanical factors in cerulein pancreatitis may account for the observation of a greater effect of NAC on serum amylase and lipase in the cerulein model ( 17 ) .
It is of note that the beneficial effects of NF- « B and cytokine inhibition may also be pronounced at later stages of taurocholate-induced pancreatitis .
Inhibition NF-KB ACTIVATION IN TAUROCHOLATE PANCREATITIS of NF-kB with another antioxidant , pyrrolidinedithio-carbamate , has been reported to improve the survival of rats with taurocholate pancreatitis ( 42 ) .
Our study focused on the early events in this model .
Finally , our data provide characterization of some molecular events in the pancreatic response to saline intraductal infusion .
Saline infusion into the pancreatic duct is not a harmless procedure ( 2 , 31 , 45 ) .
The hydrostatic pressure increase is one of several factors that can trigger the inflammatory reaction in the pancreas ( 82 ) .
In this regard , intraductal saline infusion may be extrapolated to the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography used in humans that is associated with a risk of pancreatitis ( 18 , 29 ) .
In the present study , although saline infusion did not cause the necrohemorrhagic changes as observed after taurocholate infusion , it did induce significant hyperamy-lasemia and hyperlipasemia , inflammatory cell infiltration , and trypsin activation in the head of the pancreas .
Furthermore , we observed saline-induced activation of NF-kB and some cytokines/chemokines ( e.g .
, IL-6 , KC , and MCP-1 ) in response to saline infusion .
A particularly strong activation was observed for AP-1 , which was comparable to that induced by taurocholate .
These results indicate that an increase in intrapancreatic hydrostatic pressure in itself can trigger some pathways initiating an inflammatory response .
In summary , our study demonstrated that taurocholate infusion results in activation of the transcription factors NF- « kB and AP-1 and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and iNOS in the pancreas .
NF- < kB ( but not AP-1 ) activation and upregulation of proinflammatory molecules were more pronounced in the head than in the tail segment of the pancreas .
The localized responses correlated with the severity of the lesion , including morphological changes , neutrophil infiltration , and pancreatic trypsin activation .
Inhibition of NF- < B activation resulted in amelioration of the local inflammatory response .
Intraductal saline infusion also caused morphological and molecular changes that reflect pancreatic injury , although much milder compared with taurocholate infusion .
The results indicate that activation of transcription factors and inflammatory molecule expression is a common mechanism in the development of acute pancreatitis in different models of pancreatitis .
