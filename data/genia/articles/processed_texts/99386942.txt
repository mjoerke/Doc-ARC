To understand the function of AML1 during B cell differentiation , we analyzed regulatory regions of B cell-specific genes for potential AML1-binding sites and have identified a putative AML1-binding site in the promoter of the B cell-specific tyrosine kinase gene , bik .
Gel mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays demonstrate that AML1 binds specifically to this site in the blk promoter and this binding site is important for blk promoter activity .
Furthermore , in vitro binding analysis revealed that the AML1 runt DNA-binding domain physically interacts with the paired DNA-binding domain of BSAP , a B cell-specific transcription factor .
BSAP has been shown previously to be important for B cell-specific regulation of the bik gene .
Physical interaction of AML1 with BSAP correlates with functional cooperativity in transfection studies where AML1 and BSAP synergistically activate blk promoter transcription by more than 50-fold .
These results demonstrate physical and functional interactions between AML1 and BSAP and suggest that AML1 is an important factor for regulating a critical B cell-specific gene , blk .
AML1 is a member of the PEBP2/CBEF family of transcription factors ( 1 , 2 ) .
These factors consist of heterodimers between the DNA binding a subunit and the subunit , CBFB , which does not bind DNA directly but enhances the binding of the a subunit ( 3 ) .
Multiple a subunit genes , including CBFal ( AML3 ) , AML1 ( CBFa2 ) , and CBFa3 ( AML2 ) , as well as alternatively spliced isoforms of the « and B subunits have been detected ( 4 , 5 ) .
All of the CBFa proteins have a DNA-binding domain ( the runt domain ) , which is similar to the Drosophila pair-rule gene , runt ( 6 ) .
AML1 and other PEBP2/CBFa « proteins are transcription factors whose recognition sequence is required for tissue specific expression of several hematopoietic genes including M-CSF receptor , GM-CSF , IL-3 , T cell receptors , immunoglob- ulin u heavy chain , defensin NP-3 , and myeloperoxidase ( 7- * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grants AI39613 ( to T.

AML1 knockout mice indicate , furthermore , that AML1 is indeed a critical regulator of early hematopoiesis ( 16 , 17 ) .
The AML1 gene is frequently associated with chromosomal translocations in different forms of leukemia , including t ( 8 ; 21 ) , t ( 3 ; 21 ) , in addition to t ( 12 ; 21 ) ( 1 , 18-20 ) .
The B subunit of PEBP2/ CBF is also involved in a chromosomal inversion , inv ( 16 ) , associated with FAB M4eo AML ( 21 ) .
Therefore , each of the two chains of the PEBP2/CBF heterodimer is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia .
T ( 12 ; 21 ) is a common chromosomal abnormality in childhood pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( 20 , 22 ) .
This translocation generates two chimeric genes , TEL /AML1 and AML1/ TEL .
Only the TEL /AML1 chimeric gene product is consistently detected in cells with t ( 12 ; 21 ) ( 23 ) .
The TEL/AML1 chimeric gene expresses a fusion protein that contains the 333 NH , -terminal amino acids of the TEL protein encoding the Pointed dimerization domain but lacking the Ets DNA-binding domain , and almost the entire AML1 protein , including the AML1 DNA-binding domain .
Therefore , the TEL/AML1 fusion protein can interact with AML1 DNA-binding sites and possibly interfere with AMLL function during B cell differentiation .
This indicates that AML1 may play an important role in controlling gene expression during normal B cell differentiation .
To study the function of AML1 in B-cell differentiation , we analyzed regulatory regions of B cell-specific genes for the presence of AML1l-binding sites .
We observed a consensus AML1-binding site in the promoter of the bik gene .
BLK , a Src family member , encodes a B cell-specific , 55-kDa protein tyrosine kinase p55 `` ( 24 ) .
BLK is associated with the B cell antigen receptor and is involved in signal transduction events ( 25 ) .
The B cell antigen receptor complex is formed by membrane IgM noncovalently associated with heterodimers of B29 and mb-1 ( 26 , 27 ) .
Antigen cross-linking to the B cell antigen receptor leads to a rapid and transient increase in tyrosine kinase activity resulting in activation of several signal transduction pathways , including the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway .
The antigen receptor does not itself contain an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain ; therefore , tyrosine kinase activation is due to signal transduction mediated through interaction of two B cell antigen receptor-associated proteins , Iga ( mb-1 ) and IgB ( B29 ) with the cytoplasmic Sre-like kinases , BLK , LYN , and FYN ( 28 ) .
This rapid and transient activation of tyrosine kinases triggers a cascade of downstream events , leading to changes in gene expression and either cell proliferation and differentiation or apoptosis .
BLK is exclusively expressed in B cells at the pro-B , pre-B , and mature B cell stages , but not in plasma cells or non-B cells ( 29 ) .
The function of BLK in B cell antigen receptor signaling is not clear , although several studies have implicated the BLK kinase in antigen receptor cross-linking mediated growth arrest and apoptosis ( 30 , 31 ) .
24671 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 24672 However , transgenic mice expressing a constitutively activated BLK mutant in the B cell lineage develop B lymphoid tumors ( 82 ) .
Therefore , control of blk gene expression could be directly related to B cell development and neoplasia .
B cell specificity of bik gene expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level and a 320-bp ' promoter region of the murine bik promoter appears to contain most of the B cell-specific regulatory elements ( 29 , 33 ) .
Relatively little is known about the transcriptional regulation of bik gene expression .
It has been reported that B cell-specific activator protein ( BSAP/Pax5 ) binds to the bik promoter , and recently BSAP as well as NF- « B were shown to transactivate the bik promoter ( 33 , 34 ) .
BSAP is a critical transcription factor for B cell development with a similar expression pattern as BLK ( 35 , 36 ) .
BSAP belongs to the paired box ( Pax ) gene family , which plays an important role during the development of the central nervous system and during B cell development ( 35-37 ) .
BSAP has been shown to act as both a positive and negative regulator of gene expression controlling the expression of several B cell-specific genes including CD19 , bik , and various immunoglobulin genes ( 83 , 38-43 ) .
We now report that AML1 binds to a functionally important region of the bik promoter , directly interacts with the paired box DNA-binding domain of BSAP protein through its runt homology domain , and cooperates with BSAP in activating bik promoter transcription .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSA ) -The probe for the EMSA was a double-stranded oligonucleotide with bp -47 to -28 of the blk upstream region ( Fig .

RESULTS AML1 Interacts with a Sequence 3 ' of the BSAP Site of the Murine blk Promoter-The TEL/AML1L fusion protein is associated with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
Since the TEL/AML1 protein has lost the Ets DNA-binding domain of TEL , but still contains the intact AML1 DNA-binding domain , this fusion protein could possibly generate leukemia by interfering with the function of normal AML1 or other PEBP2/CBEF family members in the activation of critical B cell developmental genes .
Therefore , we searched the regulatory regions of several B cell-specific genes for putative AML1-binding sites and found an AML 1 binding consensus sequence `` TGTGGT `` in the B cell-specific bik promoter at bp -39 to -34 , just downstream of the BSAP-binding site ( Fig .
1 ) .
In addition to the putative AML1 site we also detected putative binding sites for several other transcription factors including three putative Ets-binding sites and a helix-loop-helix protein-binding site ( Fig .
1 ) .
To test whether AML1 can interact with the bik promoter , oligonucleotides containing the AML1 consensus sequence from the bik promoter were used in EMSA experiments with nuclear extracts from the B cell line , Ba/F3 , or with in vitro translated AML1L .
As shown in Fig .
2A , Ba/F3 nuclear extract formed a specific protein-DNA complex with the bik promoter bp -47 to -28 oligonucleotide .
This protein-DNA complex was specifically competed by unlabeled self-oligonu-cleotide or an oligonucleotide encoding the Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer PEBP2/CBF-binding site ( 50 ) , but not by an unlabeled non-PEBP2/CBF binding oligonucleotide .
These data suggested that this complex contains a PEBP2/CBF related protein .
To further characterize this protein , antiserum raised against the NH , -terminal region of one of the PEBP2/ CBF family members , AML1 ( 46 ) , was used in the EMSA analysis .

Transcription factor AML1 binds to the blk promoter .
The bik promoter region oligonucleotide bp -47 to -28 was *°P-labeled and incubated with 1 ug of double-stranded poly ( dI-dC ) in the absence or presence of either nuclear extracts or in vitro translated proteins .
A , labeled oligonucleotide was incubated in the absence of nuclear extracts ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of 5 ug of nuclear extracts prepared from the B cell line Ba/F3 ( Zanes 2-6 ) .
For competition analysis , 50-fold molar excesses of unlabeled blk bp -47 to -28 oligonucleotide ( Zane 3 ) , AMLL consensus-binding site oligonucleotide from Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer ( Zane 4 ) , and an oligonucleotide containing a PU.1-binding site ( Fane 5 ) were used in the binding reactions .
In lane 6 , 1 ul of anti-AML1 serum was added to the binding reaction .
B , in vitro translated AML1 and CBFB were used in the bandshift experiments .
Radiolabeled bik promoter oligonucleotide was incubated with 2 ul of in vitro translation reticulocyte lysate control without any protein expression DNA ( Zane 1 ) , 5 ug of nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells ( lane 2 ) , 2 ul of in vitro translated AML1 ( lane 3 ) , or 2 ul of in vitro translated AML1 and 2 pl of in vitro translated ( lane 4 ) .
The top of the gel ( T ) , the migration of the AMLI1-DNA complex ( AML1 ) , and the free probes ( F ) are marked on the right of each panel .
The smaller arrow in panel A marks a specific DNA-protein complex , which is either CBFa-DNA complex in the absence of CBF $ S or with degraded CBF proteins .
* in panel B marks the nonspecific shifted bands formed with endogenous protein in unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate or with nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells .
specific protein-DNA complex was drastically reduced and a supershifted band was detected indicating that the protein in Ba/F3 cell nuclear extracts interacting with the bik promoter AML1 site is either identical with AML1 or closely related .
Additional EMSA analysis demonstrated that in vitro translated AML 1 formed a complex with the same radiolabeled bik promoter probe ( Fig .
2B ) .
These results clearly demonstrate that PEBP2/CBF transcription factors , such as AML1 , can interact specifically with the bik promoter AML1 site .
AML1 Induces blk Promoter Transcription-To determine whether the AML1-binding site is functionally relevant for bik promoter activity , the AML1 site was mutated from TGTGGT 24673 A 120 100 , 80 60 40 20 Promoter Activity ( % ) 7000 1 6000 5000 4000 3000 2000 1000 l , IM H | a AML 1+CBF fk + Promoter Activity ( RLU ) pBLK-Iuc pBLK ( mAML1 ) -lue Fic .

AML1 is an important transcription factor for blk promoter activity .
A , mutation of the AML1-binding site significantly reduces bik promoter activity .
The promoterless pXP2 luciferase con-struct , the wild-type blk promoter-luciferase construct ( pBLK-luc ) , and the AML1 site mutated construct ( pBLK ( mAML1 ) -luc ) were transiently transfected into B cell lines BJA-B ( ® ) and Ba/F3 ( § ) .
B , AML1 stimulates transcription from the blk promoter .
CV-1 cells were transfected by the Ca , ( POA4 ) , precipitation method with 3.5 ug of the wild type blk promoter-luciferase construct ( pBLK-luc ) or the AML1-binding site mutated bik promoter construct ( pBLK ( mAML1 ) -luc ) .
These constructs were co-transfected with or without 0.5 pg each of AML1 and its heterodimer partner CBFS expression vector pCMV-AMLIB and pCMV-CBF $ S .
The averages and standard deviations were generated from three separate experiments .
Luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency with the co-transfected growth hormone plasmid Rous sarcoma virus-human growth hormone .
The error bars indicate the mean + S.D .

As shown in Fig .
3A , transient transfection into the B cell line BJA-B demonstrated that the bik gene upstream region from bp -191 to +136 has strong promoter activity as previously shown ( 33 ) .
A 25-fold increase in luciferase expression was observed in comparison to the promoterless luciferase construct pXP2 .
Mutation of the AML1-binding site in the bik promoter reduced the promoter activity to 67 % when compared with the wild type promoter .
Furthermore , the same mutation also reduced the promoter activity to a similar level in another B cell line , Ba/F3 .
This indicates that the AML1-binding site in the bik promoter is a functionally relevant site , although not absolutely essential .
To test whether AML1 can indeed transactivate the bik promoter , co-transfec-tion experiments were performed in CV-1 cells with expression vectors for AML1 and its heterodimer partner CBF .
As shown in Fig .
3B , exogenous AML1 together with CBFRG expression increases transcription of the wild type bik promoter-luciferase construct by 7-fold .
Mutation of the AML1-binding site reduced transactivation of the bik promoter by AMLUVCBEF to less than 2-fold .
These data together with the results from the DNA-protein interaction studies demonstrate that AML1 or a related 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 24674 AML 1 Regulates the blk Promoter A runt transactivation 87 domain 204 d 479 omain _ AML1 ___ Maza oma | Lina aes , Fic .

AML1 physically interacts with BSAP .

The details of the constructions are described under 16 `` Experimental Procedures . ``
Five ul of in vitro translated ( IVT ) , `` °S-labeled full-length AML1 ( panel B ) , NH-terminal portion of AML1 ( panel C ) , or AML1 runt homology domain ( panel D ) were loaded on the gel and served as positive controls ( lane 1 ) , or incubated with E. coli-produced GST ( Zane 2 ) , and GST-BSAP ( lane 3 ) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads .

AML1 Physically Interacts with BSAP-As shown in Fig .
1 , the AML1-binding site is relatively close to the transcription initiation site of the bik gene .
Six base pairs upstream of the AML1 site is a region that has been identified as a BSAP-binding site ( 33 , 34 ) .
BSAP is a B cell-specific activating protein , which is a critical transcription factor for B cell-specific gene expression and B cell development .
Since AML1 has been shown to interact and cooperate with other transcription factors , and the AML1 site is adjacent to the BSAP-binding site , we analyzed whether AML1 can cooperate with BSAP in regulating bik gene expression .
First , we studied their physical interaction using GST-pull down assays , in which Escherichia coli expressing GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with in vitro translated °°S-labeled proteins .
As shown in Fig .
4A , in vitro translated full-length AML1l can be specifically retained on agarose beads containing the fusion protein made from BSAP ( GST-BSAP ) , but not on glutathione beads containing only GST .
This result indicates that AML1 can physically interact with BSAP .
To analyze this interaction in more detail , DNA constructs containing only the NH-terminal portion of AML1 ( a.a. 1-208 ) or the AML 1 runt homology domain ( a.a. 87-208 ) were in vitro translated in the presence of [ ®°S ) methionine .

These results indicate that the runt homology domain of AML1 is responsible for the interaction with BSAP .
To determine which domain of BSAP is responsible for its interaction with AML1 , GST-fusion proteins containing COOH-terminal deletion mutants of BSAP were used in the binding reactions .
Removal of the carboxyl terminus up to a.a. 312 did not have any effect on AML1L interaction ( Fig .
46 , lane 3 ) .
The BSAP NH , -terminal portion ( a.a. 1-159 ) containing the paired DNA-binding domain retained the interaction with AML1 as well ( Fig .
46 , lane 4 ) .
In contrast , GST -fusion protein containing only the BSAP COOH-terminal portion ( a.a. 234-391 ) did not show any interaction with AML1 .
These results demonstrate that AML1 can directly interact with BSAP and this interaction is through the runt homology domain of AML1 and the paired domain of BSAP ( 6 , 42 , 51 ) .
AML1 Cooperates with BSAP in Transactivation of the blk Promoter-Both AML1l-binding site mutation analysis and transactivation analysis indicate that AML1 is an important transcription factor for bik promoter activity ( Fig .
3 ) .
BSAP has been shown to be a critical regulator of bik promoter activity ( 33 , 34 ) and data in Fig .
4 have demonstrated the physical interaction between these two transcription factors .

AML1 and BSAP synergistically activate the blk promoter .
CV-1 cells were transfected by the Ca , ( PO , ) , precipitation method with 3.5 ug of blk promoter-luciferase construct ( pBLK-luc ) in the presence or absence of 0.5 ug of the AML1 , CBFB , and BSAP expression constructs pCMV-AML1B , pCMV-CBF $ , or pCI-BSAP , re-spectively , as indicated .
The averages and standard deviations were generated from three separate experiments .
Luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency with the co-transfected growth hormone plasmid Rous sarcoma virus-human growth hormone .
The error bars indicate the mean + S.D .
Fold increases in the promoter activity are relative to that in the absence of any additional transcription factors .
associated with functional cooperativity in activating bik gene expression , we performed co-transactivation experiments in monkey kidney CV-1 cells as shown in Fig .
5 .
In the presence of only the parental expression vector ( control ) , luciferase expression directed by the bik promoter is ~2-fold over the promoterless construct .
When BSAP was used alone in the transactivation experiments , there was an 8-fold induction of bik promoter activity .
AML1 together with its heterodimer partner CBFB activated the bik promoter 12-fold .
When all three transcription factors , BSAP , AML1 , and CBFB were used in the same transactivation experiment , bik promoter activity was induced by 51-fold .
These results demonstrate a strong transcriptional synergy of bik promoter activity in the presence of all three factors , indicating that physical interaction between AML1L and BSAP leads to functional cooperativity in the context of the bik promoter .
DISCUSSION AML1 is a transcription factor identified by studying t ( 8 ; 21 ) associated acute myeloid leukemia ( 1 , 52-54 ) .
The function of AML1 in hematopoiesis has been demonstrated by analyzing its role in regulating the expression of critical hematopoietic genes and by studying AML 1 null mice ( 55 , 56 ) .
AML1 knockout mice die during embryogenesis with the block of definitive hematopoiesis ( 16 , 17 ) .
These studies indicate that AML1 plays an important role during early hematopoietic progenitor cell formation .
AML1 binds to the regulatory elements of genes specifically expressed in different lineages of hematopoietic cells or of genes important for lineage development .
Recently , AML1 has been found to associate with a chromosomal trans-location , t ( 12 ; 21 ) , commonly associated with B-cell lineage differentiation , indicating an important role for AML 1 during B cell development ( 20 , 22 ) .
Nevertheless , only one potential B cell-specific target gene for AML1 , the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer ( 57 ) , has been identified to date .
Therefore , we decided to search for other potential target genes for AML1 in B cells .
We identified a putative AML1-binding site in the promoter region of the B cell-specific bik gene and tested the potential role of AML 1 in B-cell specific bik gene regulation .
We provide strong evidence here that AML1 directly interacts with a functionally important region of the bik promoter and transactivates the promoter .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that AML1 physically interacts with another critical B-cell transcription factor BSAP and synergizes with BSAP in regu- 24675 lating bik promoter activity .
There are different alternatively spliced forms of AML1 , which have been named as AML1L ( AML1a ) , AMLIA ( AML1b ) , and AML1B ( AML1c ) .
In this pa-per , we used `` AML1 `` to include different forms of the AML1L protein .
AMLIB was used in the transactivation and in vitro transcription reactions .
AML1 is a member of the CBF protein family .
All three a subunits of the CBF family contain the highly conserved runt homology domain , which encodes the DNA-binding domain .
Therefore , all three a subunits recognize the same `` TGTGGT `` DNA sequence .
Previous studies by others have identified different members of the CBFa protein in B cell lines and a B cell-enriched tissue spleen , using antibodies specifically against three different CBFa subunits .
Their results show that AML1 and AML2 are expressed at similar levels in B lineage cells ; AML3 is not detectable ( 58 ) .
The AML1 antiserum that we used in Fig .
2 is raised against the AML1 NH , -terminal 17 amino acids .
The NH , -terminal region is conserved between all three CBFa proteins .
Since both AML1 and AML2 are expressed at similar levels in B cells and both AML1 and AML2 have a similar DNA binding activity ( 58 ) , it is possible that both of them are in the supershifted protein-DNA complex as shown in Fig .
2 .
It has been reported previously that CBFB enhances AML1L binding to DNA ( 3 ) and CBFB-AML1 forms a slower mobility shifted band with DNA than AMLI-DNA complex ( 46 ) .
As shown in Fig .
2B , in vitro translated AML1 binds to DNA and addition of CBFB enhances the binding of AML1 with the DNA .
However , we did not detect an obvious slower mobility complex .
This is probably due to the lack of a particular modification in the in vitro translation system that is required for forming a stable complex of a heterodimer CBF protein with DNA , or the specific experimental conditions do not favor the formation of the complex during gel electrophoresis .
Mutation of the AML 1 site in the bik promoter significantly reduced promoter activity .
However , this mutation did not abolish the promoter activity , indicating that AML1 is an important factor for the promoter activity .
Other transcription factors that bind to the bik promoter could also contribute to the promoter activity .
As shown in Fig .
1 , besides the AML1L-binding site , there are several other potential transcription factor-binding sites including a binding site for the B cell-specific BSAP transcription factor just upstream of the AMLL site .
BSAP has been reported previously to play a crucial role in the regulation of the bik promoter ( 33 , 34 ) .
Therefore , we analyzed whether AML1 and BSAP could interact with each other and whether there is any synergy between these two factors in promoter activation .
The results from GST-pull down assays demonstrated a strong interaction between these two factors , and the interaction is between the AML1 runt homology domain and the BSAP paired domain .
The original function of the runt homology domain includes direct binding to DNA and formation of heterodimers with CBFB .
There have been reports about AML1 physically interacting with other transcription factors through the runt homology domain , including Ets-1 , PU.1 , and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein family members ( 14 , 48 , 49 ) .
Similarly , the paired domain of BSAP has been shown to be involved in protein-protein interactions with members of the Ets family ( 59 ) .
The interaction between AML1 and BSAP represents a new class of interaction between AML1 and other transcription factors .
Interestingly , it is the DNA-binding domain that is involved in the interaction of both transcription factors .
It will be interesting to further study the specific amino acids involved in the different interactions .
The interaction and synergy between Ets-1 and AML1 is crucial for the enhancer function of several T cell receptor genes ( 14 , 60 ) ; 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 24676 furthermore , the interactions and synergies between AML1L and PU.1 ( 49 ) , Myb ( 61 ) , and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( 48 ) have been demonstrated to serve critical functions during activation of myeloid specific gene expression .
Both AML1 and BSAP are critical regulators of hematopoiesis ( 16 , 17 , 62 ) .
In addition , both genes have been directly implicated in B cell malignancies ( 20 , 63 ) .
The interaction and synergy between AML1 and BSAP could play a significant role in B cell-specific gene expression and disruption of this interaction due to chromosomal translocations or other chromosomal abnormalities could play a critical role in B cell transformation .
Further experiments using other B cell-specific gene targets will be extremely interesting .
