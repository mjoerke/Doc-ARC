Communication Constitutive Dephosphorylation and Activation of a Member of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells , NF-AT1 , in Tax-expressing and Type I Human T-cell Leukemia Virus-infected Human T Cells* ( Received for publication , September 24 , 1996 , and in revised form , November 15 , 1996 ) LiFeng Goodt # , Sanjay B. Maggirwart , Edward W. Harhaj , and Shao-Cong Sun§ From the Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine , Hershey Medical Center , Hershey , Pennsylvania 17033 The tax gene product of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-I ) transactivates interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene through activation of an enhancer termed CD28 responsive element ( CD28RE ) .
Tax activation of the CD28RE is partially mediated by a member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells , NF-AT1 .
We have previously shown that NF-AT1 is constitutively active in Jurkat T cells stably transfected with the Tax cDNA , although the underlying molecular mechanism and physiological relevance of this finding remain unclear .
In this report , we demonstrate that the active form of NF-AT1 is also present in the nuclei of HTLV-I-transformed T cells that express the Tax protein .
Interestingly , the constitutive activation of NF-AT1 in these T cells is associated with its dephosphorylation .
Furthermore , the dephosphorylated NF-AT1 can be rapidly rephosphorylated when the cells are incubated with cyclosporin A , an immunosuppressant inhibiting the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin .
These results suggest that activation of NF-AT1 in Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-transformed T cells results from its dephosphorylation , which in turn may be due to deregulation of calcineurin .
The type I human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-1 ) ' is an etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia , an aggressive and often fatal malignancy of mature CD4* T lymphocytes ( 1-5 ) .
The HTLV-I genome encodes a 40-kDa protein , termed Tax , that has been shown to transcriptionally induce the expression of various cellular genes , such as the T-cell growth factor inter * This study was supported by United States Public Health Service Grant RO1 CA68471-01 and an AmFAR grant made in memory of Richard Lee Schiffman ( to S.-C.

Printed in U.S.A. leukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and the « subunit of its high affinity receptor complex ( IL-2Ra ) ( reviewed in Ref .
6 ) .
The central role of these genes in normal T-cell activation and growth suggests that this specific action of Tax may be an important mechanism underlying HTLV-I-induced T-cell transformation ( 6 , 7 ) .
Emerging lines of evidence suggest that Tax induces the target genes indirectly by modulating the activity or expression of specific host transcription factors ( 6 , 8 ) .
In this regard , we and others have recently shown that Tax induces the transcription of IL-2 gene through activation of cellular transcription factors that bind to an IL-2 gene enhancer termed CD28 responsive element ( CD28RE ) ( 9-12 ) .
At least two families of transcription factors , NF- « B/Rel and NF-AT , have been shown to bind to the CD28RE enhancer sequence ( 11-15 ) .
The NF- « B/Rel factors participate in the transcriptional activation of a large array of genes involved in cell growth and activation ( 16-18 ) .
This family contains various dimeric complexes composed of a set of structurally related polypeptides , including p50 ( NF- « B1 ) , p52 ( NF- « B2 ) , RelA ( previously named p65 ) , RelB , and the proto-oncoprotein c-Rel ( reviewed in Ref .
19 ) .
The biological activity of NF- « B/Rel is regulated through cytoplasmic retention by association with specific inhibitory proteins termed IxBs ( 20 ) .
Various immunological stimuli , as well as the HTLV-I Tax protein , induce the phosphorylation and subsequent proteolysis of IxBs , leading to the nuclear translocation of the active forms of NF- « B/Rel ( for recent re-views , see Refs .
21-28 ) .
NF-AT represents a family of enhancer binding proteins that participate in the regulation of a large number of cytokine genes ( 24-26 ) .
The NF-AT family includes at least four structurally related proteins , NF-AT1 ( previously named NF-ATp ) , NF-ATc , NF-AT3 , and NF-AT4 ( 27-31 ) .
In normal T cells , the NF-AT proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm as hyper-phosphorylated inactive precursors ( 27 , 34 ) .
Treatment of T cells with stimuli of the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) complex or the calcium ionophore ionomycin results in the rapid dephosphorylation of NF-AT , which can be detected by its mobility change on SDS-polyacrylamide gels ( 82 , 34-86 ) .
Dephosphorylation of NF-AT is associated with its nuclear translocation and activation of its DNA binding activity ( 34 , 36 ) .
The serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin appears to play an essential role in the activation of NF-AT , as the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A ( CSA ) and FK506 block the signal-induced dephosphorylation and the subsequent nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-AT ( 34 , 36 ) .
In further support of this notion , NF-AT has been shown to physically associate with calcineurin ( 35 , 37 , 38 ) and serve as a substrate of calcineurin in vitro ( 39-41 ) .
The pattern of NF-AT regulation may differ between normal T cells and transformed T-cell lines .
For example , in human Jurkat leukemic T cells , a portion of NF-AT1 is constitutively localized in the nucleus even when the cells are incubated with CSA , although this nuclear form of NF-AT1 is inactive in DNA binding ( 33 ) .
Interestingly , we have recently shown that the DNA binding activity of NF-AT1 is constitutively activated in Jurkat T cells stably transfected with the HTLV-I Tax eDNA expression vector .
This NF-AT member is one of the major factors binding to the IL-2 CD28RE and appears to play an important role in the activation of IL-2 promoter in these Tax-expressing cells ( 11 ) .
In the present study , we demonstrate 1425 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 1426 that NF-AT1 is also constitutively activated in HTLV-I-infected human T cells .
Furthermore , activation of NF-AT1 in these cells results from its dephosphorylation through a CSA-sensitive pathway .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture and Reagents-Human Jurkat leukemic T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , and antibiotics .
A Jurkat cell line stably transfected with a Tax cDNA expression vector ( Jurkat-Tax , see Ref .
42 ) was cultured in the same way as for Jurkat cells except that the medium was supplemented with 400 ug/ml G418 .
The HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines C8166 , HUT1O2 , K3T , MT-2 , and MT-4 cells , which had been characterized previously ( 48-46 ) , were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum .
Except for MT-4 , all these cells express the Tax protein of HTLV-I .
CSA was provided by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Co. ( East Hanover , NJ ) .
The antibody against NF-AT1 was a gift from Dr. Anjana Rao ( Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA ; see Ref .
27 ) .
The antisera specific for various NF- « B/Re !
components were kindly provided by Dr. Warner C. Greene ( The Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology , San Francisco , CA ) .
Immunoblotting and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSA ) -The HTLV-I-infected T cells and noninfected parental Jurkat or Jurkat-Tax cells were collected by centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min .
Subcel-lular and whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously ( 47 ) .
For immunoblotting analyses , protein samples ( ~15 ug ) were fractionated by 7.5 % reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and then analyzed for immunoreactivity with anti-NF-AT1 using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( ECL ; DuPont NEN ) .
EMSA was performed by incubating the nuclear extracts ( ~5 ug ) with a `` °P-radiolabeled CD28RE probe derived from the human IL-2 gene ( AAA-GAAATTCCAAAGAGT ) followed by resolving the DNA-protein complexes on native 4 % polyacrylamide gels ( 48 ) .
For antibody `` supershift `` assays , 1 ul of diluted antisera ( 5-fold for anti-NF-AT1 , 3-fold for the various anti-NF- « B antisera ) was added to the EMSA reaction 5 min before electrophoresis .
RESULTS NF-AT1 Is Constitutively Active in HTLV-L-infected Human T Cells-To examine whether NF-AT1 is active in HTLV-I-infected T cells , EMSA was performed using a °°P-labeled human IL-2 CD28RE , and nuclear extracts were isolated from various HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines as well as Jurkat cells or Jurkat cells stably transfected with the fax cDNA ( Jurkat-Tax ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
As shown previously ( 11 ) , two major protein complexes , C1 and C2 , were detected from the Jurkat-Tax cells ( Fig .
14 , lane 2 ) , while only low amounts of the C1 complex were found from the parental Jurkat cells ( Zane 1 ) .
Previous studies have shown that the intensity of the C1 complex varies in both the parental Jurkat cells and Jurkat-Tax cells ; however , the C2 complex is detectable only in the Jurkat-Tax cells ( 11 ) .
Furthermore , the C2 complex , but not the C1 complex , has been shown to specifically immunoreact with an NF-AT1-specific antibody in antibody supershift assays , thus suggesting that NF-AT1 is involved in the formation of the inducible C2 complex ( 11 ) .
In the HTLV-l-infected cell lines ( including C8166 , HUTI1O02 , and K3T ) , two CD28RE-binding complexes were detected ( Zanes 3-5 , C2 and C3 ) , one of which ( C2 ) comigrated with the NF-AT1 complex from the Jurkat-Tax cells ( lane 2 , C2 ) , although all three cell lines lacked the C1 complex .
In a separate experiment , the HTLV-I-infected MT-2 cells were also shown to express the C2 and C3 complexes ( Fig .
1B , lane 2 ) .
However , another HTLV-I-infected cell line , MT-4 , that was deficient in Tax expression ( 46 , 49 ) , did not express either C2 or C3 although it expressed high levels of the C1 complex ( Zane 3 ) .
To examine the proteins involved in the formation of these CD28RE-binding complexes , EMSA was performed using the C8166 cell extract in the presence of specific antibodies for various known IL-2 regulating transcription factors , including members of the NF- « B/Rel family and NF-AT1 ( Fig .
1C ) .

Activation of NF-AT1 in Jurkat-Tax and HTLV-I-infected T cells .
A and B , EMSA analyses of CD28RE-binding NF-AT1 complex .
Nuclear extracts were isolated from Jurkat , Jurkat-Tax , or the indicated HTLV-I-transformed T-cell lines and then subjected to EMSA using a *°P-labeled CD28RE probe .
The data presented in A and B were generated from two different experiments , in which the gels were run for different times ( 2 h for A and 3 h for B ) .
The specific CD28RE-binding proteins were designated CI-C3 .
NS indicates a non-specific protein that binds to different probes ( data not shown ) .
The C2 complex in Jurkat-Tax cells ( Zane 2 ) was previously shown to contain NF-AT1 ( 11 ) .
C , antibody supershift analysis of the CD28RE-binding proteins in HTLV-I-infected T cells .
The nuclear extract isolated from C8166 cells was subjected to EMSA either in the absence ( None ) or presence of the indicated preimmune or immune sera .
The supershifted bands are indicated with arrowheads .
NF- « B/Rel selectively supershifted the C3 complex , thus suggesting that this protein complex was composed of both p50 and c-Rel .
The antisera for the RelA ( Zane 5 ) , p52 ( lane 6 ) , and RelB ( lane 7 ) subunits of NF- « B/Rel as well as a preimmune serum ( lane 2 ) did not react with either C2 or C3 .
As expected , the C2 complex , which comigrated with the NF-AT1 complex in Jurkat-Tax cells ( see Fig .
14 , C2 ) , was supershifted by the anti-NF-AT1l antiserum ( Zane 8 ) .
The same result was obtained using the nuclear extracts isolated from HUT1O2 , K3T , and MT2 cells ( data not shown ) .
Similar antibody supershift assays revealed that , as previously observed ( 11 ) , no immunoreactivity was found between the C1 complex in Jurkat or MT-4 and the anti-NF-AT1 antibody .
Together , these results suggest that activation of NF-AT1 DNA binding activity in both Jurkat and HTLV-I-infected T cells is associated with the expression of the Tax protein .
Additionally , the CD28RE is also bound by the p50/c-Rel heterodimer in HTLV-L-infected T cells .
In Jurkat-Tax cells , which express significantly lower levels of NF- « B/Rel activity than in the HTLV-I-infected cells ( 50 ) , the binding of NF- « B/Rel to CD28RE was very weak .
However , the p50/c-Rel complex could be detected in these cells , especially when the EMSA conditions were modified to favor the binding of this NF- « B/Rel heterodimer ( in the presence of about 60 mm NaCl , data not shown , also see Fig .
3C ) .

NF-AT1 is constitutively dephosphorylated in Tax-expressing Jurkat and HTLV-I-infected cells .
A , dephosphorylation of NF-AT1 occurs in Jurkat-Tax but not the parental Jurkat cells .
Cytoplasmic ( C ) and nuclear ( N ) extracts were isolated from either Jurkat or Jurkat-Tax cells and then subjected to immunoblotting using an NF-AT1-specific antiserum .
B , NF-AT1 is dephosphorylated in Tax-expressing but not Tax-deficient HTLV-I-infected cells .
Whole-cell extracts were isolated from either the Tax-expressing ( HUT102 , K3T , and MT-2 ) or Tax-deficient ( MT-4 ) HTLV-I-infected cell lines .
The expression of NF-AT1 was analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-NF-AT antibody .
The molecular sizes for NF-AT1 and its dephosphorylated form ( NF-AT1* ) are estimated to be approximately 130 and 115 , respectively ( not shown ) .
nological stimuli or the calcium ionophore ionomycin involves its dephosphorylation , and the dephosphorylated form of NF-ATI migrates more rapidly than the fully phosphorylated form on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 82 , 34 ) .
To examine whether Tax-mediated activation of NF-AT1 also resulted from dephosphorylation of NF-AT1 , immunoblotting studies were performed to analyze the phosphorylation state of NF-AT1 in Jurkat-Tax and the various HTLV-I-infected cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
In the parental Jurkat cells , a single NF-AT1 protein band was detected , and , as previously reported ( 83 ) , this phosphorylated form of NF-AT1 was located in both cytoplasm and nucleus ( Fig .
24 , lanes 1 and 2 ) , although the phosphorylated form of nuclear NF-AT1 was inactive in CD28RE binding ( see Fig .
1A , lane 1 ) .
Interestingly , in Jurkat-Tax cells , a large amount of NF-AT1 was present in its more rapidly migrating dephosphorylated form and localized in the nucleus ( Fig .
24 , lanes 3 and 4 , NF-AT1* ) .
The dephosphorylated form of NF-AT1 was also detected from the Tax-expressing HTLV-|-infected HUT1O02 ( Fig .
2B , lane 1 ) , K3T ( lane 2 ) , MT2 ( lane 3 ) , and C8166 ( data not shown ) cells .
However , in the MT-4 cells , which are deficient in Tax expression , the entire NF-AT1 protein pool was in the phosphorylated form ( Fig .
2B , lane 4 , NF-AT1 ) .
Thus , the DNA binding activity of NF-AT1L was well correlated with its dephosphorylation ( compare Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
The level of NF-AT1 dephosphorylation in the Tax-expressing T cells appeared to vary during different stages of cell culture , with fresh culture exhibiting higher levels ( data not shown ) .
However , no significant amount of the fast migrating dephosphorylated NF-AT1L was ever detected in the Tax-deficient Jurkat and MT4 cells ( Fig .
2 and data not shown ) .
Taken together with the results shown in Fig .
1 , it suggests that activation of NF-AT1 in Tax-expressing and T cells likely results from its dephosphorylation .
NF-AT1 Is Rapidly Rephosphorylated and Inactivated in Cells Treated with CSA-To explore the mechanism of NF-AT1L dephosphorylation and to further correlate the dephosphorylation and DNA binding activity of this transcription factor , the effect of CSA on the electrophoretic mobility and DNA binding activity of NF-AT1 was analyzed .
For these studies , the HTLV-T-infected K3T cells ( Fig .
34 ) or Jurkat-Tax cells ( Fig .
3B ) were incubated with CSA and then subjected to immunoblot to analyze the expression of the different forms of NF-AT1 in both cytoplasm and nucleus .
As shown in Fig .
3A , CSA treatment for as short as 5 min led to the disappearance of the dephosphorylated form of NF-AT1 , which was associated with the increase of the phosphorylated form of NF-AT1 in both cytoplasm and nucleus ( Zanes 3 and 4 ) .
However , in contrast to that seen 1427 A B 1 2 % 3 4 t : gausk ® `` Rag tt geet < 4- NF- AT -D 0 « < -NF-AT'-A » AL s , SS \ \o\ \ e » . '

Effect of CSA on the dephosphorylation and DNA binding activity of NF-AT1 in Tax-expressing cells .
A and B , immunoblotting analysis of NF-AT1 in K8T ( A ) or Jurkat-Tax ( B ) cells that had been treated with CSA ( 1 pg/ml ) for the indicated time periods .
Both cytoplasmic ( C ) and nuclear ( N ) extracts were analyzed .
The phosphorylated ( NF-AT1 ) and dephosphorylated ( NF-AT1* ) forms of NF-AT1L are indicated .
C , EMSA analysis of CD28RE-binding proteins in Jurkat ( lane 1 ) or Jurkat-Tax ( lanes 2 and 3 ) cells treated with CSA ( 1 pg/m1 ) for the indicated time .
The NF-AT1 and NF-kB/Re !
l complexes are indicated .
with immunologically stimulated murine T cells ( 34 ) , the rephosphorylated NF-AT1 in these HTLV-I-transformed T cells did not relocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm even after 30 min of CSA treatment ( Fig .
3A , lanes 3-8 ) .
Similar results were obtained from Jurkat-Tax cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
Nevertheless , parallel EMSA revealed that the rephosphorylation of NF-AT1I was associated with the loss of its DNA binding activity in both the Jurkat-Tax ( Fig .
3C ) and K3T ( data not shown ) cells .
Together , these results suggest that the constitutive DNA binding activity of NF-AT1 in Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-infected T cells apparently results from its dephosphorylation , which in turn is likely mediated by the CSA-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin .
These studies also indicate that the nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-AT1L may be differentially regulated in these Tax-expressing cells .
DISCUSSION Transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene in normal T cells requires both the TCR-mediated primary and the CD28-medi-ated costimulatory signals .
However , in T cells infected with HTLV-I or expressing the viral Tax protein , various pharma-cological stimuli that mimic the TCR signaling are sufficient to induce the transcription of the IL-2 gene ( 12 , 42 ) , thus suggesting that Tax may provide a costimulatory signal for T-cell activation .
Interestingly , the Tax-responsive element within the IL-2 promoter has been identified to be the CD28RE ( 9-12 , 51 ) , an enhancer element known to respond to the CD28 costimulatory signal ( 13 , 52 ) .
The transcription factors involved in Tax-mediated activation of CD28RE remain unclear .
Although NF- « B/Rel has been shown to bind to the CD28RE which may contribute to the activation of this enhancer ( 12 ) , additional factors are clearly required since a Tax mutant ( M47 ) that is capable of NF-kB activation ( 53 ) fails to transac-tivate the CD28RE ( 10 , 18 ) .
In support of this notion , we have recently shown that NF-AT1 binds to the CD28RE in a Tax-expressing Jurkat cell line ( Jurkat-Tax ) and participates in the activation of CD28RE in a reporter gene assay .
In the present study , we have demonstrated that NF-AT1 is constitutively activated in both Jurkat-Tax and various HTLV-T-infected T-cell lines expressing the viral Tax protein ( Fig .
1 ) .
This finding strongly suggests that activation of NF-AT may be 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 1428 part of the mechanism by which HTLV-I activates human T cells .
As seen with immunological stimuli ( 82 , 34 , 36 ) , activation of NF-AT1 in the HTLV-|-infected T cells is associated with the dephosphorylation of this normally heavily phosphorylated protein ( Fig .
2 ) .
However , the dephosphorylated form of NF-AT1 is constitutively expressed in the nucleus of these virally infected T cells , which is in contrast to the transient activation of NF-AT1 in antigen-stimulated noninfected T cells ( 34 ) .
This apparent deregulation of NF-AT1 can be due to either the up-regulation of calcineurin activity or down-regu-lation of the opposing NF-AT kinase activity .
We think the former possibility is more likely true since the dephosphorylated NF-AT1 can be rapidly rephosphorylated when the cells are incubated with the calcineurin inhibitor CSA ( Fig .
3 ) , which suggests that the NF-AT kinase is still active in these cells .
It is important to note , however , that the rephosphorylated NF-AT1 in CSA-treated cells is largely retained in the nucleus even though it becomes inactive in DNA binding ( Fig .
3 ) .
Although the precise underlying mechanism remains to be further investigated , it is possible that the nuclear form of NF-AT1 seen in the CSA-treated HTLV-I-transformed cells is not fully rephosphorylated .
In support of this notion , the nuclear form of NF-AT1 appears to migrate slightly faster than the cytoplasmic form ( see Fig .
3 ) .
Studies are in progress to directly analyze the phosphorylation state of the two different forms of NF-ATL .
