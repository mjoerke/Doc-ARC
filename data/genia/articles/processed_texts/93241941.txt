7 1601-1606 Cell-specific expression of helix-loop-helix transcription factors encoded by the E2A gene Ami Aronheim , Rinat Shiran , Ada Rosen and Michael D.Walker* Biochemistry Department , Weizmann Institute of Science , Rehovot 76100 , Israel Received January 4 , 1993 ; Revised and Accepted February 26 , 1993 ABSTRACT The E2A gene encodes transcription factors of the helix-loop-helix family that are implicated in cell-specific gene expression as part of dimeric complexes that interact with E box enhancer elements .
It has previously been shown that transcripts of the E2A gene can be detected in a wide range of cell types .
We have now examined expression of the mouse E2A gene at the protein level using polyclonal antisera directed against distinct portions of the E2A protein to probe blots of cellular extracts .
A 73 kDa protein was identified by this analysis : this protein is highly enriched in cell lines of B lymphoid origin as compared to pancreatic /3-cells and fibroblast cells .
The detection of this protein selectively in extracts of lymphoid cells correlates with the presence of the E box-binding activity LEF1/BCF1 in these cells ; this binding activity was previously shown to be efficiently recognized by antiserum directed against E2A gene products .
Transfection of cells with full length E2A cDNA leads to appearance of protein co-migrating with the 73 kDa protein on SDS gel electrophoresis and co-migrating with LEF1/BCF1 on mobility shift analysis .
Our results are consistent with the view that the DNA-binding activity LEF1/BCF1 is a homodimer of E2A proteins ; the selective appearance of this putative cell-specific transcription factor in B lymphoid cells seems to be attributable , at least in part , to the elevated E2A protein concentrations in these cells .
INTRODUCTION E boxes ( consensus sequence CAxxTG ) are cis-acting DNA elements important for transcription of a number of cell-specifically expressed genes ( 1-5 ) .
Proteins of the helix-loop-helix ( HLH ) family are capable of sequence-specific recognition of E boxes ( 6 , 7 ) , and are believed to mediate transcriptional activation in vivo through these sequences ( 8 ) .
The human E2A gene encodes at least two HLH proteins , E12 and E47 ( 6 , 9 ) , resulting from alternate splicing events ( 10 ) ; the respective cDNAs were originally isolated by expression screening of a lymphoid library using a DNA probe corresponding to xE2 , an E box located in the immunoglobulin x enhancer ( 6 ) .
Corresponding E2A homologs have been cloned from rodents by screening of pancreatic endocrine ( 11 , 12 ) and exocrine ( 13 ) libraries using E box probes derived from the control regions of the insulin and chymotrypsin genes respectively .
E2A RNA is detectable in a variety of cell types ( 6 , 11 , 13 , 14 ) consistent with a broad role in transcriptional regulation .
Indeed , genetic evidence from studies of daughterless ( da ) , the presumptive Drosophila homolog of the EZ2A gene , have revealed that da mutations lead to severe phenotypes in several cell types ( 15 ) .
In mammalian systems , the in vivo role of E2A gene products has been most thoroughly explored in muscle cells ; the cell-specifically expressed gene MyoD ( 16 ) and its close relatives myogenin , Myf-5 and MRF4 ( 17-20 ) heterodimerize in vitro with E2A proteins to form complexes that bind efficiently to E boxes ( 21 ) .
Such heterodimers apparently are also present in vivo : antibodies directed against MyoD or E2A proteins were shown to recognize muscle specific E box binding complexes using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis ( EMSA ) ( 22 ) .
Furthermore , fibroblasts expressing anti-sense E2A RNA showed diminished ability to undergo MyoD-induced differentiation , underscoring the importance of E2A proteins in myogenesis ( 22 ) .
In pancreatic 3 cells , E boxes have been shown to play a key role in controlling cell-specific expression of the insulin gene ( 3 , 23 , 24 ) .
Endocrine cells contain a nuclear complex , IEF1 , capable of specific E box recognition ( 25-27 ) .
IEF1 is recognized by antisera directed against EZA proteins indicating that these proteins are a component of the complex ( 12 , 27-29 ) .
An additional HLH component of IEF1 , absent from non-endocrine cells , has been defined by in vitro mixing experiments using nuclear extracts and in vitro translated HLH proteins ( 27 , 30 ) .
Thus , in at least two mammalian cell types , functional cell-specific transcription factors appear to be generated by dimerization of cell-specific HLH proteins with apparently ubiquitously-expressed HLH proteins , the E2A gene products ( 21 ) .
In lymphoid cells , a cell-specific E box binding complex ( LEFI/BCF1 ) has also been identified ( 27 , 31 , 32 ) ; antibody experiments indicate the presence of E2A protein in the complex , yet a lymphoid-specific HLH partner has not been reported .
In fact , current evidence indicates that LEF1I/BCF1 may be a * To whom correspondence should be addressed 1602 Nucleic Acids Research , 1993 , Vol .

7 homodimer of E2A proteins ( 31 , 33 ) .
However , this conclusion can not explain the absence of the LEFI/BCF1 complex in other cell types , where E2A RNA is present .
To further elucidate the role of the E2A gene in cell-specific gene expression , we used two types of polyclonal antibodies , directed against the C-terminus and N-terminus region of E2A protein , to investigate protein levels in different cell types .
Although comparable levels of steady state RNA of the E2A gene have been reported for multiple cell types , including lymphoid cells and fibroblasts ( 14 ) , we observed a dramatic difference at the protein level : immunoblot analysis identified a prominent 73 kDa protein in extracts of B lymphoid cells .
The protein was barely detectable in non-lymphoid lines tested ( at least 15-fold lower levels ) .
Several lines of evidence indicate that this protein is a product of the E2A gene .
The data therefore indicate that cell-specific mechanisms , perhaps involving post-transcriptional control , lead to preferential accumulation of E2A gene products in lymphoid cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture The following established cell lines were used : HIT M2.2.2-hamster pancreatic 3 cells ( 34 , 35 ) ; 3TC1I-mouse pancreatic 3 cells ( 36 ) ; Ltk~ cells-mouse fibroblast cell ; BHK -hamster fibroblast cells ; $ 194 , L10AC2 , and WEHI 231 cells B lymphoid lineage : $ 194 cells are a plasmacytoma line , WEHI 231 and L10AC2 are mature B cell lines .
Raji is a human lymphoma line .
All cells except WEHI 231 and L10AC2 were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagles medium in the presence of 10 % fetal calf serum , penicillin ( 200 I.U./m1 ) and streptomycin ( 100 ug/ml ) .
For WEHI 231 cells , RPMI medium was used , supplemented as above , together with 50 LM $ -mercaptoethanol .
Generation of polyclonal antibodies The EZ2A gene encodes two closely related proteins , products of alternative splicing events : the alternate cDNAs have been designated E47 and E12 ( human ) , A1 and A7 ( mouse ) , Pan-1 and Pan-2 ( rat ) , and shPan-1 and shPan-2 ( hamster ) ( 6 , 11-13 ) .
We have used the mouse cDNA A1 to generate polyclonal antisera ; fusion proteins were produced by subcloning of appropriate cDNA fragments to the expression vector pATH ( 37 ) .
pATH-A1 ( C ) ( 11 ) contains the sequences encoding the C-terminal 281 amino acids of A1 ( amino acids 369-649 ) , pATH-A1 ( N ) encodes 336 amino acids from the N-terminus of A1 ( amino acids 50-385 ) .
Bacteria containing the appropriate plasmid were induced to over-express the fusion protein and bacterial extract was fractionated by electrophoresis on 10 % polyacrylamide sodium dodecyl sulphate gels ( SDS-PAGE ) ( 38 ) .
Gels were lightly stained with Coomassie brilliant blue ( 2 g/l in H , O ) .
The band corresponding to fusion protein was excised from the gel , and 100 4g of protein was injected subcutaneously into rabbits as a suspension in incomplete Freund 's Adjuvant .
After three injections at two week intervals , serum was obtained and tested .
Immunoblot analysis Proteins fractionated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose sheets ( 39 ) .
Sheets were soaked for 2 hours in blocking buffer ( phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 10 % ( v : v ) low fat milk and 0.05 % Tween-20 ) .
All further incubation steps and washes were performed in the above buffer .
Sheets were then incubated for two hours at room temperature in the presence of a 1/2,000 dilution of appropriate antibody .
Following three washes in blocking buffer , protein A-horseradish peroxidase ( Amersham ) ( 1/10,000 dilution ) was added , and incubation allowed to proceed for an additional two hours .
For visualization of antibody-antigen complexes , the ECL detection system ( Amersham ) was employed , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Immunoprecipitation Protein-A-sepharose beads ( Sigma ) were pre-incubated with the appropriate anti-sera in 150 L1 PBS for 90 min .
Following three washes with PBS , nuclear extract was added ( 300 ug of protein ) and incubated for two hours at 4°C .
Subsequently beads were washed three times with 1 ml PBS and then sample buffer ( 38 ) was added .
Samples were heated at 100°C for 3 min and the supernatant solutions were fractionated by SDS-PAGE .
Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis as described above .

Preparation of cell extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described ( 27 ) .
For whole cell lysate extracts , cells were harvested and pelleted as above .
Subsequently , 100 gl of PBS and 100 ul of sample buffer ( 6.25 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8 , 10 % glycerol , 1 % lithium dodecyl sulfate , and 0.005 % bromophenol blue ) were added .
The mixture was sonicated for 2 min in a sonicator bath ( Elma transsonic 310 ) , and then heated at 100°C for 5 min .
Protein content of the extract was determined by the Lowry procedure ( 40 ) , following precipitation of proteins by addition of trichloroacetic acid ( 10 % ) in presence of sodium deoxycholate ( 2 mg/ml ) .
EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts was performed as previously described ( 27 ) .
Transfection HIT M.2.2.2 ( 35 ) cells ( 2x 106 ) were transfected with a total of 15 ug DNA using the calcium phosphate procedure ( 41 ) .
Cells were harvested after 36 hours and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously ( 27 , 42 ) .
In vitro The plasmid pBS-ATG- # 267 contains a near full-length Al protein fused in frame to a portion of the B lactamase gene to generate a protein ( A267 ) of almost identical molecular weight to full length A1 ( 30 ) .
In vitro transcription was performed using 0.5 ug of DNA in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase .
Typically , 20 % of the transcription reaction was used for in vitro translation with rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .

7 1603 RESULTS To determine whether E2A proteins , like E2A transcripts , are present at comparable concentrations in different cell types , we performed immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts using anti-A1 ( C ) antibodies ( serum raised against the carboxy terminal part of A1 ( 27 ) ) .
A 73 kDa protein was efficiently identified in WEHI 231 nuclear extract ; this protein was barely detectable in extracts from fibroblasts or 3 cells ( Fig .
1 A ) .
In order to confirm that the 73 kDa protein represents an EZ2A gene product , and to exclude the possibility that the recognition is towards an HLH structural determinant , we raised polyclonal antibodies against an amino terminal segment of Al ( see Methods ) , which we designate A1 ( N ) .
The serum directed against A1 ( N ) detected a protein of identical electrophoretic mobility ( 73 kDa ) in extracts from WEHI 231 cells but not fibroblasts or 3 cells ( Fig .
1 B ) .
The reactivity to the 73 kDa protein was not observed using the corresponding preimmune sera or anti-trpE antiserum ( data not shown-see also Fig 5 A ) .
The anti-A1 ( N ) antiserum also efficiently recognized LEF1/BCFI1 binding activity upon EMSA analysis ( not shown ) .
Since the above analyses were performed using nuclear extracts , they could conceivably reflect differences in subcellular localization of the EZ2A proteins among the different cell types .
We therefore performed immunoblot analysis using extracts of total cell lysates from fibroblasts , 3 cells and B lymphoid cells .
The results obtained with both anti-sera were similar to those obtained with nuclear extracts ( Figs .
1 C , D ) , indicating that the 73 kDa protein is present at substantially higher levels in lymphoid cells compared to fibroblast and ( 3 cells and that the differential signals observed using nuclear extracts are not attributable to differential subcellular localization .

7 To confirm that the two antisera recognize distinct epitopes on E2A proteins , we tested their ability to interact with in vitro translated E2A proteins using EMSA analysis .
As expected , anti-A1 ( C ) recognizes both in vitro translated A267 ( encoded by a near-full length A1 cDNA ( pBS-ATG- # 267 ) spanning both A1 ( N ) and A1 ( C ) proteins ) and in vitro translated A1 ( C ) protein ( Fig 2 , lanes 3,7 ) .
Anti-A1 ( N ) antisera recognized efficiently the A267 protein ( Fig 2 , lane 4 ) but showed essentially no recognition of the A1 ( C ) protein ( Fig 2 , lane 8 ) .
Thus the epitopes recognized by A1 ( N ) antisera are distinct from those on the A1 ( C ) protein ; the efficient cell-specific recognition of the 73 kDa protein by both antisera is a strong indication that the 73 kDa protein is an E2A gene product .
We further analyzed whether other lymphoid cells exhibit increased levels of the 73 kDa protein using immunoblot analysis probed with anti-A1 ( C ) ( Fig 3 ) .
Indeed , nuclear extracts derived from $ 194 , L10AC2 and Raji cells showed increased levels of the 73 kDa protein compared to fibroblast cell extracts .
This indicates that increased levels of the 73 kDa is a more general characteristic of B-lymphoid cells ; moreover the ability to detect the E2A protein product in these cells extract correlates with the LEF1/BCFI binding activity detected using EMSA analysis ( 27 , 32 ) .
The detection system employed ( ECL , Amersham ) is based on enzymatic activity ( horseradish peroxidase conjugated to protein-A ) .
Using a purified glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the HLH domain of E2A protein , a linear response was obtained in the range of 0-50 ug of purified protein ( data not shown ) .
In order to quantitatively compare the expression in B lymphoid cells to that in fibroblasts , we performed immunoblot analysis using serial dilutions of WEHI Figure 4 .
A : Immunoblot analysis of WEHI-231 nuclear extract .
The indicated amounts of Ltk~ and WEHI-231 nuclear extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-A1 ( C ) antibodies .

Right panel-absorbance measurement of 73 kDa band from serial dilutions of WEHI 231 extract ( Figure 4A , lanes 2-6 ) 231 nuclear extract ( Fig 4 ) .
Based on the analysis , the 73 kDa protein is at least 15-fold more abundant in WEHI 231 ( Fig 4B ) and L10AC2 extracts ( Fig 3 ) as compared to fibroblast ( Ltk~ ) extracts .
The relationship between the 73 kDa protein , LEF1/BCF1 and E2A gene products was further examined using an immunoprecipitation procedure .
Anti-A1 ( C ) antiserum but not pre-immune serum was able to efficiently immunoprecipitate the 73 kDa protein ( Fig 5 A , lanes 1 , 2 ) .
The supernatant solution remaining following immunoprecipitation was tested for the presence of LEF1/BCFI1 binding activity using EMSA ( Fig 5 B ) .
Both the untreated nuclear extract ( lane marked '- ' ) and the extract treated with pre-immune serum ( lane 1 ) contained LEF1I/BCFIL activity ; the extract treated with anti-A1 ( C ) was completely depleted of LEFI/BCF1 activity ( lane 2 ) .
Thus , immunoprecipitation by anti-A1 ( C ) of the 73 kDa protein from nuclear extracts correlates with depletion of LEF1/BCFI binding activity from the extracts .
The observed size of the 73 kDa protein corresponds fairly well with the calculated molecular weight of E2A protein ( 67-68 kDa ) based on cDNA sequences ( 13 , 43 ) and with the mobility of in vitro translated EZ2A proteins on SDS and EMSA gel electrophoresis ( 30 ) .
To compare more directly the size of the 73 kDa lymphoid cell protein with the protein product of the full length cloned cDNA of A1 and A7 , we expressed these cDNAs in vivo .
Expression plasmids containing cDNAs encoding full length A1 and A7 under the control of a viral promoter ( Rous sarcoma virus ) were transiently transfected into HIT cells , a pancreatic 3 cell line chosen for this experiment because of its relatively high transfection efficiency and low basal levels of endogenous 73 kDa protein ( Fig 1 ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared , and immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-A1 ( C ) antibodies .
Cells transfected with the full length cDNA showed a band absent in non-transfected control cells and that co-migrated with the 73 kDa lymphoid cell protein ( Fig .
6 A ) .
Moreover , when the extracts from transfected cells were used in EMSA with an E box probe ( xE4 , which is efficiently recognized by LEF1/BCFI1 ( 27 ) ) , a protein-DNA complex was observed with identical migration compared to LEF1I/BCFI « < 9 owe ~~ Figure 5 .

Immunoprecipitates ( Fig 5A ) using pre-immune serum ( lane 1 ) or anti-A1 ( C ) ( lane 2 ) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using anti A1 ( C ) antisera .
Molecular weights indicated are derived from the mobility of standard proteins ( Rainbow markers-Amersham ) .
The prominent band at 50 kDa corresponds to IgG heavy chain present in the immunoprecipitates and recognized by protein A-HRP .
Figure 5B shows EMSA analysis of the supernatant solution remaining following treatment with antiserum .
Nuclear extracts following treatment with no antiserum ( lane marked '- ' ) , preimmune serum ( lane 1 ) or anti A1 ( C ) ( lane 2 ) were analyzed by EMSA with the E box probe IEBI1 ( 25 ) .
The mobility of LEFI/BCF1 is indicated .
( Fig .
6 B compare lane 2 and lane 3 , 4 ) and also identical to the complex obtained with in vitro translated protein corresponding in size to the full length cDNA ( Fig .
6 B lane 5 ) .
Therefore , the data strongly suggest that the 73 kDa protein identified by immunoblot using anti-E2A antibodies represents the cellular E2A protein .
DISCUSSION Cell-specific expression of genes derived from diverse cell lineages requires the cis elements known as E boxes .
The significance of these sequences appears to be their ability to be recognized by transcription factors of the HLH family .
This rapidly growing family of proteins has been classified into 3 groups designated basic-HLH domain ( bHLH ) and bHLH-zip ( basic HLH-leucine zipper ) and dnHLH ( dominant negative ) ( 44 ) .
Within the bHLH proteins , a further sub-classification has been made according to tissue distribution : cell-specifically expressed bHLH proteins such as MyoD and achaete scute appear to homodimerize inefficiently , although they can heterodimerize with 'constitutively ' expressed bHLH proteins such as E2A to produce an efficient DNA binding complex ( 21 ) .
The proteins from the bHLH family can also heterodimerize with dnHLH to produce a protein complex incapable of DNA binding .
Enhancers of immunoglobulin genes contain multiple E boxes whose importance was originally recognized by in vivo footprint experiments : the E boxes showed lymphoid selective footprinting ( 1 , 45 ) .
Mutagenesis experiments revealed that the E boxes play an important role in the in vivo activity of immunoglobulin enhancers ( 2 ) .
More recently , an E box binding nuclear complex ( LEF1/BCF1 ) was identified in lymphoid cells ( 27 , 31 ) .
This complex was efficiently recognized by antibodies directed against E2A proteins , indicating the presence of EZ2A proteins in the complex ( 27 , 31 ) .
Based on the preferential recognition of this complex as compared to heterodimeric complexes between E2A proteins and MyoD , and on the co-migration of the complex with in vitro and in vivo expressed E2A gene products , it has been A B WESTERN USING ANTI-A1 GEL MOBILITY SHIFT TRANSFECTED ‘ * A7 A1 - - A7 A1 EXTRACT HIT WEHIL HIT - HIT HIT WEHI - HIT - HIT A1 LEF1 -- » trig wor- waa IEF1 - -- a » - Am te # * * 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 ewam « -- » Grie to ap came vo Ap -at 73 kDa -- i » Figure 6 .

7 1605 suggested that LEF1/BCF1 corresponds to a homodimer of E2A proteins ( 31 ) .
This conclusion however can not explain the apparent absence of LEF1/BCF1 in extracts of non-lymphoid cells given the presence of E2A RNA and protein in such cells .
We and others have previously shown that polyclonal antiserum directed against E2A gene products recognize the cell-specific complexes IEF1 ( 12 , 27-29 ) and LEFI/BCFI ( 27 , 31-33 ) suggesting that these complexes contain E2A gene products .
We used two independently derived antisera , one directed towards the N-terminal portion of A1 and the other to the C-terminal portion of A1 , to determine the relative abundance of E2A gene products in different cell types using immunoblot analysis .
With both antibodies , we observed a prominent protein of 73 kDa in nuclear extracts of B lymphoid cells ; the protein was barely detectable ( at least 15-fold lower levels ) in extracts from fibroblast or { 3 cells .
This result was also obtained using whole cell lysates .
The lymphoid cell preference and the recognition of the 73 kDa protein by 2 distinct anti-A1 antisera indicates strongly that the protein corresponds to a product of the EZ2A gene and is a component of LEFI/BCF1 .
The Jurkat cell line ( human T lymphoid ) also shows substantial levels of the 73 kDa protein ( data not shown ) .
Several additional lines of evidence support the notion that the 73 kDa protein indeed corresponds to the cellular E2A protein product : 1 .
Transfection experiments , in which full length E2A gene products were transiently expressed in cultured 3 cells : upon transfection , extracts from such cells showed proteins which co-migrated with the 73 kDa protein on immunoblot analysis following SDS-PAGE and generated protein-DNA complexes in vitro which co-migrated with LEF1/BCF1 on EMSA ( Fig 6 ) .
2 .
Immunoprecipitation , using anti-E2A protein antibodies , of the 73 kDa protein from lymphoid extracts correlates with the loss of LEF1I/BCF1 binding activity of this extract ( Fig .
5 ) .
3 .
In a parallel series of experiments , we have screened a Agt11 expression library from a late pre-B lymphoid cell line 70Z ( which contain both LEF1/BCF1 and the 73 kDa protein-data not shown ) using antibodies directed against the C-terminus of A1 .
Of 7 clones identified , sequencing analysis has shown that all were derived from the EZ2A gene ( data not shown ) ; this underscores the specificity of the anti-A 1 antibodies towards the E2A gene product , and argues against the possibility that the 73 kDa protein may be a product of a related gene , eg .
ITF2 ( 9 ) or HEB ( 46 ) , recognized by anti-Al antibodies because of immunological cross-reactivity .
In this work , we present data which can explain the fact that LEFI/BCF1 binding activity is restricted to lymphoid cells : lymphoid cells have dramatically elevated levels of E2A gene products as compared with other cells .
This can account for the ready detection of homodimeric E2A complexes ( LEF1/BCF1 ) , capable of DNA binding .
On the other hand , in non-lymphoid cells , E2A gene products are present at substantially lower levels ( at least 15-fold less ) and presumably insufficient homodimer can form to produce detectable binding activity .
In endocrine cells or muscle cells , where E box binding activity is detected , the binding complexes appear to be composed of heterodimers of E2A gene products together with cell specific HLH proteins such as MyoD .
The ability to detect such DNA binding complexes , despite the apparently very low levels of EZ2A proteins , is consistent with the known dimerization and DNA-binding properties of E2A proteins : for example , E47 forms heterodimers with MyoD much more readily than homodimers with itself ; E12 binds DNA very poorly as a homodimer ( 10 ) .
The above 1606 Nucleic Acids Research , 1993 , Vol .

7 explanation is consistent with our ability to generate an -like binding activity in 3 cells upon transfection with an E2A expression plasmid .
The precise role of LEF1I/BCF1 in control of lymphoid cell gene expression has not been determined ( 47 ) .
Its preferential appearance in cells where immunoglobulin enhancers are active ( 27 , 31 ) , its ability in vitro to bind several of the key E boxes of immunoglobulin enhancers ( 27 , 31 ) , together with the ability of E2A proteins to trans-activate reporter plasmids containing multiple E box sequences ( 9 ) and activate germ line immunoglobulin heavy chain gene transcription ( 48 ) are consistent with a role as a lymphoid cell-specific transcriptional activator of immunoglobulin enhancers .
Interestingly , this cell-specific factor appears to be composed of proteins which had hitherto been considered to be 'constitutive ' .
In fact , the data presented in this report indicates that there are substantially higher concentrations of E2A proteins in cells of B lymphoid lineage than in fibroblasts or 3 cells .
It appears therefore that distinct cell lineages use different strategies to generate the characteristic HLH transcription complexes that are necessary for generating unique patterns of cell-specific gene expression .
In pancreatic 3 cells and muscle cells , heterodimeric complexes are formed between a cell-specific HLH protein ( eg IESF1 , MyoD ) and E2A proteins ( present at low concentrations in non-lymphoid cells ) .
In B lymphoid cells , the accumulation of elevated concentrations of E2A proteins leads to formation of the homodimeric DNA binding activity ( LEFLI/BCF1 ) , a presumptive lymphoid cell transcription factor .
The precise mechanisms mediating the preferential accumulation of E2A gene products in lymphoid cells remain to be established .
