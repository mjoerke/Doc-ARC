Small apolar substitutions ( 11a-methyl , 11a-fluoro-methyl ) did not markedly decrease the affinity for the vitamin D receptor , but larger ( 11a-chloromethyl or 11a- or or more polar substitutions ( 11a « -hydroxymethyl , 11a « - ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) ) decreased the affinity to less than 5 % of that of 1 « ,25-O0H ) ; D ; .
Their affinity for the vitamin D-binding protein , however , increased up to 4-fold .
The biological activity of 1l1l1a-methyl-1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; closely resembled that of the natural hormone on normal and leukemic cell proliferation and bone resorption , whereas its in vivo effect on calcium metabolism of the rachitic chick was about 50 % of that of 1a,25- ( OH ) D ; .
The 11 @ -methyl analog had a > 10-fold lower activity .
The differentiating effects of the other C-11 analogs on human promyeloid leukemia cells ( HL-60 ) agreed well with their bone-resorbing activity and receptor affinity , but they demonstrated lower calcemic effects in vivo .
Large or polar substitutions on C-11 of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; thus impair the binding to the vitamin D receptor but increase the affinity to vitamin D-binding protein .

vitamin D that binds to specific receptors with high affinity ( 1-3 ) .
These receptors are not only present in the classical target tissues for vitamin D ( intestine and bone ) but also in many other cells and organs , especially those with a calcium transport function ( e.g .
placenta ) or with a calcium-dependent hormonal secretion ( e.g .
endocrine pancreas ) .
Moreover , the vitamin D hormone modifies growth and differentiation of both normal and malignant cells ( 4 , 5 ) .
This new knowledge opened the search for vitamin D analogs with more specific actions on one of these target tissues with the aim of specific therapeutic intervention ( e.g .
for immune disorders , cancer control , psoriasis , or osteoporosis ) .
Many other steroid hormones have natural hydroxylations in the C-ring ( e.g .
corti-sol ) , or C-ring analogs have important agonist or antagonist effects ( e.g .
RU 38486 with antiprogesterone and antigluco-corticoid effects ( 6 ) ) .
The role of the C-ring of the secosteroid structure of vitamin D in the binding to or activation of the natural vitamin D-binding proteins was not yet fully explored ( 7 ) .
We therefore synthesized a series of analogs of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; with modifications of the C-ring at C-11 .
These analogs retain or increase their binding properties for the serum vitamin D-binding protein ( DBP ) , whereas large or polar substitutions decrease the receptor binding and biological activity in vitro and in vivo .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; was a gift of M. Uskokovic ( Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley , NJ ) .
[ °H ] 25-O0H-D ; and [ °H ] 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; were obtained from Amersham ( Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom ) at specific activities of 160 and 180 Ci/mmol , respectively .
[ methyl-*H ] Thymi-dine ( 2 Ci/mmol ) was purchased from the same company .
Culture media were purchased from GIBCO ( Roskilde , Denmark ) .
Penicillin and streptomycin were from Boehringer ( Mannheim , Germany ) ; 4-nitro blue tetrazolium ( NBT ) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were obtained from Sigma .
Phytohemagglutinin came from Welcome ( Dartford , UK ) .
Nonspecific acid esterase was measured by a cyto-chemical assay for a-naphthyl acetate esterase using Sigma kit 90 ( Sigma ) .
Rat , chick , and human serum vitamin D binding protein ( hDBP ) and hDBP -free serum were prepared by affinity chromatog-raphy as described previously ( 8 , 9 ) .
Methods Synthesis of C-11-substituted 18,25- ( OH ) ; D ; , Analogs-All analogs of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; were obtained by total synthesis .
The method rests on the Horner coupling ( 10 ) of the A-ring with the appropriate CD-ring of the vitamin D ; skeleton , both in the required enantiomeric form ( Fig .
1 ) .
In practice , ketones 1b-1k , possessing the various substituents at C-11 , under protected form if necessary ( see 1d , 1h , and 1i ) , were condensed with the lithium salt of the protected phosphine oxide 2 , yielding the corresponding trienes 3 .

Synopsis of the synthetic pathways used for the synthesis of C-11-substituted analogs of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; .
The nomenclature is the same as in Fig .
1. lower yields ( ~20-40 % ) were observed when coupling derivatives that possess the B-oriented substituent at C-11 , as in le , 1i , and 1k .
At the stage of the coupling reaction , all hydroxyl groups ( i.e .
at C-1 , C-3 , and C-25 ) needed to be protected .
Removal of these protective groups in 3 under acidic conditions was the final step in the synthesis and led to the analogs listed in Fig .
1 .
The protected phosphine oxide 2 was obtained following a known method ( 11 ) .
Depending on the nature of the C-11 substituent , the various derivatives 1b-1k were synthesized using different methods .
These are summarized in Fig .
2 and briefly described below .
Full synthetic details will be described elsewhere .
The synthesis of derivatives 1b , 1f , 1g , and 1j is shown in Fig .
24 .
The appropriately functionalized CD-ring skeleton was obtained OTHP= mfoj by oxidative fission of the triene system and of the 22,23-double bond in vitamin D ; , followed by reduction to Inhoffen-Lythgoe diol 4 ( 12 ) .
After selective activation of the primary alcohol in 4 , the side chain at C-22 was completed , bearing the 25-hydroxyl under protected form ( 13 ) .
After oxidation of the alcohol in 5 to the corresponding ketone , a conjugated double bond was introduced following standard methodology ( 14 , 15 ) .
The resulting enone 6 then served as a substrate for the introduction at C-11 of the methyl ( 1b ) , ethyl ( 1f ) , vinyl ( 1g ) , and phenyl ( 1j ) substituents using the appropriate organocopper reagents ( 16-18 ) .
As shown in Fig .
2B , the vinyl-substituted derivative 1g was the precursor for 1d and le and may also serve to obtain 1h .
The oxidative fission of the vinyl bond , followed by reduction , leads to diol 7 .
After selective protection of the primary alcohol , further oxidation led to ketone 1d .
On the other hand , selective activation of the primary alcohol allowed for the further introduction of a fluorine substituent ( 19 ) ; analogous oxidation here resulted in ketone le .
A nondestructive oxidation of the vinyl double bond in 1g using 9-borabicyclononane/hydrogen peroxide opened the way to the 2-hy-droxyethyl-substituted derivative 1h ( 20 ) .
Derivatives possessing a G-oriented substituent at C-11 , ie .
1¢ , 1i , and 1k , were obtained as shown in Fig .
2C .
Starting from the already described 1b , 1h , and 1 } , a double bond was first introduced as in 8 .
Subsequent catalytic hydrogenation then afforded the required derivatives with epimeric configuration at C-11 .
Cells and Animals-The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line ( HL-60 ) and UMR 106 lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Company ( Rockville , MD ) and T. J. Martin ( Melbourne , Australia ) , respectively .
Peripheral blood mixed mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were prepared from buffy coats of human blood obtained from the Belgian Red Cross .
Vitamin D-deficient chicks were reared on a vitamin D-deficient diet ( 1 % calcium , 1 % phosphorus , Hope farms , Woerden , The Netherlands ) and housed in a windowless room .
After 3 weeks , they received a daily intramuscular injection for 10 days with or its analogs solubilized in polyethylene glycol .
Serum , bone , and duodenal mucosa were then collected under Nembutal anesthesia .
Calcium was measured by atomic absorptiom-etry in serum and ashed bone .
Serum osteocalcin and duodenal calbindin D-28K were measured by radioimmunoassay using specific anti-chick antisera raised against these chick proteins .
3046 Binding Studies-Binding of vitamin D metabolites and analogs to hDBP was performed at 4 °C essentially as described previously ( 21 ) .
[ °H ] 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; and 1a,25- ( OH ) : D ; or its analogs were added in 5 ul of ethanol into glass tubes and incubated with hDBP ( 0.18 LM ) in a final volume of 1 ml ( 0.01 M Tris-HCl , 0.154 m NaCl , pH 7.4 ) for 3 h at 4°C .
Phase separation was then obtained by the addition of 0.5 ml of cold dextran-coated charcoal .
The binding to the vitamin D receptor was estimated in either rat duodenal mucosa or in rat osteoblastic cells ( UMR 106 cells ) .
Duodenal mucosa from normal Wistar rats was sonicated in 4 volumes of buffer ( 0.05 M Tris-HCl , 0.5 M KCl , 5 mm dithiothreitol , 10 mM Na ; MoO , , and 1.5 mM EDTA , pH 7.5 ) .
The high speed supernatant was then incubated with 0.2 nm [ °H ] 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; and increasing concentrations of 14,25 ( OH ) : D ; or its analogs in a final volume of 0.3 ml for 15 min at 25 °C followed by 5 min at 0 °C .
Phase separation was then obtained by the addition of cold dextran-coated charcoal .
The osteoblast homogenate was obtained from UMR 106 cells grown from the last 24 h in a-minimum Eagle 's medium supplemented with 2 % charcoal-treated fetal calf serum .
The cells were then trypsinized , and cytosolic extracts were prepared .
The cell pellet was extracted on ice in a hypertonic buffer as was done for the duodenal mucosa , and the receptor binding was measured ( 22 ) .
Culture Conditions for Mitogen-induced Proliferation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells-PBMC were obtained from the buffy coat of blood donors by centrifugation of heparinized venous blood on Ficoll-Paque ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
The culture conditions were identical with those previously described ( 9 ) , except that the culture medium in the present study was RPMI 1640 .
Culture Conditions for HL-60 Cells-HL-60 cells were seeded at 1.2 X 10° cells/ml , and or its analogs were added in ethanol ( final concentration , < 0.2 % ) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( GIBCO ) , 100 units/ml penicillin , and 100 ug/ml streptomycin ( Boehringer ) .
After 4 days of culture in a humified atmosphere of 5 % CO ; in air at 37 °C , the dishes were shaken to lose any adherent cells , and all cells were then assayed for maturation by NBT reduction assay and for proliferation by [ °H ] thymidine incorporation .
NBT Reduction Assay-Superoxide production was assayed by NBT-reducing activity as described previously ( 23 ) .
HL-60 cells at 1.5 x 10° cells/ml were mixed with an equal volume of freshly prepared solution of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( 200 ng/ml ) and NBT ( 2 mg/ml ) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C .
The percentage of cells containing black formazan deposits was determined using a hemacy-tometer .
Bone Resorption Assay-Bone resorption was measured as the release of previously incorporated Ca from 17-day-old fetal radii and ulnae after 3 and 6 days of culture as described in the fetal rat limb explant assay of Raisz ( 24 ) .
The radii and ulnae were cultured in BGJ , medium with 2 % charcoal-treated fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 40 % O ; , 55 % N ; , and 5 % CO ; .
To reduce free exchangeable calcium , the limb explants were precultured for 24 h. The medium was then replaced by control medium or medium containing 14 « ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; or one of the analogs .
After 3 days , the medium was replaced by fresh medium of the same composition .
The Ca content of the medium at 3 and 6 days and of the 5 % trichloroacetic acid extracts of the bones were measured by liquid scintillation counting and used to calculate the total `` Ca content and the cumulative percentage of `` `` Ca released .
Measurement of 25-O0H-D ; -24-hydroxylase Activity-UMR 106 cells were cultured as described above .
After the second culture period of 24 h , the medium was changed to serum-free « -minimum Eagle 's medium containing 0.1 % bovine serum albumin , and the cells were incubated for 1 h with 1 « ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; or one of the analogs .
The cells were then washed for 2 h with a-minimum Eagle 's medium supplemented with 2 % bovine serum albumin , followed by an incubation for 1 h with [ °H } 25-0H-D ; in the presence of 0.1 % bovine serum albumin .
Subsequently , the formation of 24,25- ( OH ) : D ; was assessed as described previously ( 25 ) .
RESULTS Binding Studies-The affinity of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; for the vitamin D receptor in rat duodenal mucosa , as measured at 4°C and pH 7.4 and analyzed by Scatchard plot , was 1.4 *+ 0.8 x 10° MC ( mean + S.D .
, n » = 10 ) .
Similar results were obtained in rat osteoblast sarcoma and calf thymus homoge-nates ( data not shown ) .
The effect of substitution of C-11 of on receptor binding is summarized in Table I Vitamin D Analogs with C-ring Modifications and shown in Fig .
3 .
A methyl or fluoromethyl group on C-11 did not markedly alter the binding properties , whereas l11a-ethyl or l1a-vinyl groups caused a 5-10-fold decrease in receptor binding .
A still larger ( phenyl ) or more polar ( 11a-OHCH ; or 11a- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) ) group further decreased the receptor affinity ( Table I ) .
The stereochemistry of the substitution also influenced the affinity , but the effect was different for 11-methyl and 11-phenyl groups ( Table 1 ) .
The affinity of 14,25- ( OH ) ; D ; to hDBP at 4 °C was 1.5 + 0.2 X 10 `` M~ ' ( mean + S.D .
, » = 6 ) .
Apolar substitutions with one or two carbons in position C-11 increased the affinity of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; analogs for hDBP , whereas even large polar substitutions did not markedly decrease the binding to hDBP ( Fig .
4 ) .
The analogs with the highest affinity for hDBP were 1la=vinyl-1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ( 3.8-fold increase in affinity ) and 11a-methyl-1 @ ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ( 3.4-fold increase in affinity ) .
The binding of some analogs ( lla-ethyl- and 1l1a-vinyl-1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ) to purified rat and chick DBP also indicated an increased affinity of the same analogs ( 2-4-fold , data not shown ) .
Effect of C-11 Substitution of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; on Leucocyte Function-The proliferation of phytohemagglutinin-stimu-lated mixed peripheral blood lymphocytes could be inhibited by 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; and its analogs ( Fig .
5 and Table I ) .
Only 11a-methyl-1 @ ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; retained a marked potency both in the presence and absence of physiological amounts of hDBP .
Of all the other C-11-substituted 1 « ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; analogs , only showed a relative potency exceeding 2 % of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; in the absence of DBP ( Table I ) .
The absolute concentration of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; or its several analogs necessary for 50 % inhibition of proliferation varied between 5 x 10 , M for 1 « ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; and more than 10° M for ll1a-phenyl- and ( OH ) ; D ; ( Fig .
5 ) .
The presence of DBP always decreased the effect of 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; and its analogs between 10- and 100-fold , but the rank order remained essentially unchanged ( Fig .
5B ) .
The antiproliferative effect of the hemisuccinate of 11a « - ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1 @ ,25- ( OH ) : D ; was markedly lower than its nonesterified analog in contrast to their similar receptor-binding properties ( data not shown ) .
The differentiation of HL-60 cells was markedly enhanced by 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; and all the 11a- or analogs ( Table I ) .
Using NBT as the end point for vitamin D effects , lla-methyl , l1a-fluoromethyl , l1a-vinyl , and 1ll1a-ethyl-1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; were all very effective , whereas the larger or more polar analogs were less active ( Table I ) .
The effect of the vitamin D analogs on the induction of nonspecific esterase activity differed only slightly from their effect in the NBT reaction ( data not shown ) .
The differentiating effect of 1a,25- ( OH ) : D ; on HL-60 cells was reciprocal to the effect of this steroid on HL-60 cell proliferation as measured by [ °H ] thymidine incorporation ( Fig .
6 ) so that an excellent negative correlation between both parameters was observed ( r = 0.9 ; p < 0.001 ) .
A similar response was observed for three of the C-11-substituted 14a,25- ( OH ) : D ; analogs ( Fig .
6 ) .
The dose-response curve for the reduction of HL-60 cell number by 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; was , however , shifted to the right by 1 order of magnitude in comparison with the [ °H ] thymidine incorporation results ( data not shown ) .
The Effect of C-11 Substitution on Bone Resorption-The release of *Ca from prelabeled fetal mouse radii and ulnae after 3 and 6 days of culture are presented in Fig .
7 .
Both at 3 and 6 days of culture , and natural 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; were equipotent , whereas 11 « -phenyl and 11a- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1 @ ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; were much less active in mobilizing calcium ( Table I ) .

The maximal amount of calcium release was , however , similar for all vitamin D analogs .
Effect of C-11 Substitution on 25-OH-D ; -24-hydroxylase Activity-1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; and 11a-methyl-1a,25- ( OH ) ; Ds were equipotent in the induction of 24-hydroxylation of [ °H ] 25-0HD ; , whereas l1a-phenyl and 11a- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; and its hemisuccinate were largely inactive at equimolar concentrations ( data not shown ) .
Biological Activity of 1 @ ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; Analogs in the Rachitic Chick in Vivo-The concentrations of calcium in serum and bone , osteocalcin in serum , and calbindin D-28K in duodenal mucosa were measured after 10 days of treatment of vitamin D-deficient chicks with 1 « ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; or its C-11-substituted analogs .
Among the analogs tested , ll1a-methyl-1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; was the most potent on all parameters but nevertheless reached only 50 % of the potency of 14,25- ( OH ) : D ; , whereas its B-isomer was about 10 times less active .
The l1a-fluoromethy ] - and 11a-vinyl analogs also showed mild agonist activity ( Table I and Fig .
8 ) .
Larger and/or more polar substitutions on C-11 nearly totally abolished the biological activity in vivo .
DISCUSSION Analogs of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; with substitutions in the C-ring at C-11 are of special interest , and only limited chemical or biological data on such analogs are available ( 7 , 25 ) .
The synthesis of such analogs is best realized by total synthesis involving classical coupling of A and CD fragments of the vitamin D skeleton , as indicated in Fig .
1 .
The binding of C-11-substituted 1 « ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; analogs to the rat vitamin D receptor was markedly affected by the size , polarity , and stereochemistry of the substitution ( Table I ) .
Analogs with a single carbon substitution retained the highest affinity .
11a-Methyl- and retained nearly the affinity of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; for the rat osteoblast , calf thymus , or rat duodenal receptor ( Table I ) .
116-Methyl and l1a « -chloromethyl substitutions already reduced the affinity , which was further lost by introduction of a polar substitution ( 11 « -hydroxymethyl-1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ) ( Fig .
3 ) .
Analogs with two or more carbons on C-11 substitutions of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; all had decreased receptor affinity , but again , the more polar analogs had the lowest affinity .
The largest substitution ( phenyl ) also decreased the receptor affinity , but of the two stereoisomers , the 3 analog retained the highest affinity , whereas for 11-methyl isomers , the a analog had a higher affinity than the 8 analog ( Table I ) .
The receptor-vitamin D interaction is thus hindered by polar or large substitutions on the C-ring .
This must be due to the interaction at the hormone-binding site of the receptor , since it occurs as well in direct receptor binding experiments ( Fig .
3 ) and in experiments that evaluate the further gene activation by the receptor-hormone complex ( see below ) .
The proximity of C-11 to the hormone-receptor binding site could probably be exploited for photoaffinity labeling .
The affinity of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; for hDBP was similar to our previous observations ( 20 ) and to the results obtained by others ( 27 , 28 ) .
In contrast to the effect on receptor binding , substitutions on C-11 did not decrease but instead increased the affinity for hDBP ( Table I and Fig .
4 ) .
Indeed , no C-11 analog ( except showed a decreased binding to hDBP , whereas several small substitutions increased the affinity severalfold .
The stable binding to hDBP was also confirmed in in vitro studies on the effect of vitamin D analogs on lymphocyte proliferation , since the presence of hDBP decreased the activity of all the analogs 3048 ( Fig .
5 ) .
The increased affinity of C-11-substituted 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; analogs was also observed for rat and chick DBP ( data not shown ) .
When C-11 analogs of 25-OHD were analyzed , a similarly high affinity for human or rat DBP was observed ( 29 ) .
This could even be exploited for the production 100- X~ , X\ ‘ x L e 9 |-F- 2 sol- & 2 a | m x 1 1 1 L L i 19-® 10 `` 10° `` 10 `` 197* 10°5 10,25- ( OM } ; D ; or analog ( M ) BOUND/UNBOUND ( % ) 1 L 1 19° 10° 19° 107 19 % 10° 10,25- ( OH } ; D ; or analog ( M ) Fig .

The affinity of further metabolites or analogs of 1a,25- ( OH ) : D ; for DBP has not been extensively studied before , but very few have increased affinity for this plasma protein .
The two stereoisomers of 14,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D ; lose about half of their affinity for rat DBP ( 30 ) .
The natural and unnatural stereoisomers of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; -26,23-lactone have a nearly 3-fold increase in binding to rat DBP , but their binding to the chick intestinal receptor is only 0.6 or 3 % , respectively ( 31 ) A more recent analog , 26- ( 3-hydroxypropyl ) -1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; has a 2-fold increase in DBP binding but an 8-fold decrease in chick intestinal receptor binding ( 32 ) .
Our present data thus demonstrate that C-11 substitutions of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; have variable effects on receptor binding but do not sterically hinder the binding and , on the contrary , can even enhance up to 4-fold the binding affinity towards DBP .
This probably implies that C-11 extensions stick outside the binding site of the vitamin D-DBP complex but nevertheless create new interactions that stabilize the complex .
The effect of C-11 substitutions on the proliferation of normal leucocytes differed from the results obtained on proliferation and differentiation of promyelocytic tumor cells .
As described before ( 9 , 23 ) , inhibition of proliferation of leukemic cells required an about 100-fold higher concentration of 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; than necessary for normal mononuclear cells .
Of all the C-11-substituted analogs , only 11a-methyl-1a,25- ( OH ) : D ; markedly inhibited PBMC proliferation , doing so slightly better in the absence than the presence of DBP ( Fig .
5 ) .
However , several C-11 analogs markedly inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation of HL-60 cells .
The induction of differentiation ( NBT reduction ) was a mirror image of the effect of vitamin D analogs on proliferation ( [ °H ] thymidine incorporation ) ( Fig .
6 ) .
Most C-11-substituted analogs thus have higher effects on differentiation and proliferation of promyeloid leukemia cells than on normal mixed blood mononuclear cells .
The reason for this discrepancy is not clear , but differences in receptor structure , regulation , or accessibility , postreceptor differences , or simple differences in the metabolism of the vitamin analogs are all plausible .
The bone-resorbing effect of the new 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; analogs were in line with their affinity for the vitamin D receptor and their effect on the differentiation of HL-60 cells , whereas the concordance with inhibition of PBMC proliferation was rather poor ( Table I ) .
This concordance in differentiating effects on HL-60 cells and bone resorption is not unexpected * R. Bouillon and E. Van Herck , unpublished results .

since bone marrow monocyte cells , with precursors similar to those of HL-60 cells , are supposed to be at the origin of osteoclasts ( 33 , 34 ) and 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; can stimulate the differentiation of these precursors into more mature osteo-clasts .
For unexplained reasons , however , no such correlation was found for other vitamin D analogs with side chain modifications ( e.g .
A `` -24,24,24-trihomo-1 @ ,25- ( OH ) : D ; ( 85 ) ) .
The biological effects of C-11-substituted vitamin D analogs were tested both for serum and bone calcium responses and for the effect on serum osteocalcin and duodenal calbindin D-28K concentrations .
Similar results were obtained for all these parameters , but the dose-response curve for the vitamin D-responsive proteins was much steeper and allowed a better evaluation of the relative potency .
The difference between the stereoisomers of 11-methyl-1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; on receptor binding and HL-60 cell proliferation in vitro was confirmed in vivo for effects on calcium metabolism ( Table I and Fig .
8 ) .
The activity of all C-11-substituted analogs in vivo was 2-10-fold lower than the effects on bone resorption in vitro and lower than could be expected from their receptor-binding properties ( Table I ) .
This difference was most obvious for 3050 and 1l1a-vinyl-1 « ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; .
Increased DBP binding could have decreased the immediate availability of vitamin D analogs in vivo , but this would normally be offset by their longer half-lives .

P 0 Serum Calcium ( mg/100m1 ) on T Vitamin D Analogs with C-ring Modifications as expected , also demonstrated a low biological effect in vivo ( Fig .
8 ) .
Previous data on vitamin D analogs with C ring modifications are limited to the synthesis of a few 1l1a-substituted-9 ( 11 ) -dehydro-1 @ ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; analogs ( 7 ) with decreased receptor affinity ( 36 ) and to the synthesis of 11a-hydroxyvi-tamin D ; ( 26 ) .
This latter compound bound slightly better to DBP than vitamin D ; itself but displayed , as expected , a low affinity for the vitamin D receptor .
No direct studies of its further hydroxylated metabolites were performed , but l1a « -hydroxyvitamin D ; showed low biological activity in vivo ( 26 ) .
Several of the C-11-substituted analogs have a higher affinity for hDBP than the natural hormone and still retain good receptor-binding properties ( eg .
11 « -CH ; - , 11 « -CH ; F- , or l1a-vinyl-1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ) .
No natural metabolite has such properties , and only one other analog approached this combination ( 32 ) .
Increased DBP binding is expected to decrease the biological effectiveness , as has been demonstrated repeatedly in vitro ( 36 ) , but can otherwise prolong the circulating half-life .
One recent analog , 28- ( 3-hydroxypropyl ) -1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; , with only a 2-fold increase in DBP binding and an 8-fold decrease in receptor binding , increased the bone mass of ovariectomized rats when given intermittently twice a week ( 32 ) .
Several of the C-11-substituted analogs also demonstrated increased DBP binding but , at least when given once daily , this did not increase , but rather decreased , their biological efficacy .
Giving it more intermittently , as in the study by Okano et al .
( 32 ) , might be more advantageous .
Several recent analogs of 1 « ,25- ( OH ) : D ; retain good or reasonable receptor-binding properties but , contrary to our C-11-substituted analogs , display markedly decreased DBP binding properties .
Indeed , MC 903 or calcipitriol ( 37 ) , 24,24 , bishomo-1 @ ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ( 23 , 29 , 35 ) , 22-oxa-1 « ,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ( 37 ) , and 1 « ,25- ( OH ) ; -23-yne-D ; ( 89 ) all retain reasonably good ( > 10 % compared with 1a,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ) affinity for the vitamin D receptor but display a low affinity for DBP ( 10-1000-fold decrease ) .
This probably alters their pharma-cokinetics and allows better activity when applied locally ( e.g .
for psoriatic lesions ( 41 ) ) or induce greater effects on lympho- e 100 a & 2 _ / g g N Ti “ “ ‘ =='-='-.~ -- a Q ~s ba 50 n i ® € ( 1 1 L 1 _ _L .

Several C-11-substituted analogs were more potent on leukemic cell differentiation and proliferation than on normal leucocytes in vitro or calcium metabolism in vivo ( Table I ) .
This difference was , however , smaller than that observed for several analogs with side chain modifications .
Possible therapeutic effects in vivo on cancer growth or differentiation therefore will depend on further specific testing .
