Box 147 , Liverpool , Merseyside L69 3GE 1 Bioactivation of sulphamethoxazole ( SMX ) to chemically-reactive metabolites and subsequent protein conjugation is thought to be involved in SMX hypersensitivity .
We have therefore examined the cellular metabolism , disposition and conjugation of SMX and its metabolites in vitro .
2 Flow cytometry revealed binding of N-hydroxy ( SMX-NHOH ) and nitroso ( SMX-NO ) metabolites of SMX , but not of SMX itself , to the surface of viable white blood cells .
Cellular haptenation by SMX-NO was reduced by exogenous glutathione ( GSH ) .
3 SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO were rapidly reduced back to the parent compound by cysteine ( CYS ) , GSH , human peripheral blood cells and plasma , suggesting that this is an important and ubiquitous bioinactivation mechanism .
4 - Fluorescence HPLC showed that SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO depleted CYS and GSH in buffer , and to a lesser extent , in cells and plasma .
5 - Neutrophil apoptosis and inhibition of neutrophil function were induced at lower concentrations of SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO than those inducing loss of membrane viability , with SMX having no effect .
Lymphocytes were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) more sensitive to the direct cytotoxic effects of SMX-NO than neutrophils .
6 - Partitioning of SMX-NHOH into red blood cells was significantly ( P < 0.05 ) lower than with the hydroxylamine of dapsone .
7 Our results suggest that the balance between oxidation of SMX to its toxic metabolites and their reduction is an important protective cellular mechanism .
If an imbalance exists , haptenation of the toxic metabolites to bodily proteins including the surface of viable cells can occur , and may result in drug hypersensitivity .

In the U.K. , this has resulted in restricted indications for drugs such as co-trimoxazole ( Saiag et al .
, 1992 ; Pirmohamed & Park , 1995 ) , a combination of sulphamethoxazole ( SMX ) and trimetho-prim .
The hypersensitivity reactions have been attributed to the sulphonamide component ( Cribb et al .
, 19962 ) .
One of the main uses of co-trimoxazole is in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients .
In comparative studies with other agents such as dapsone and pentamidine , co-trimoxazole has been found to be the most efficacious , both for acute treatment and for prophylaxis ( Smith , 1994 ) .
However , the rate of adverse reactions in HIV-infected patients is significantly higher than in seronegative patients severely limiting its usefulness ( Carr & Cooper , 1995 ; Koopmans et al .
, 1995 ; Pirmohamed & Park , 1995 ; Tschachler et al .
, 1996 ) .
The types of reactions are similar to those observed in HIV-negative individuals and occur within 5-15 days of the start * Author for correspondence ; E-mail : bkpark @ liv.ac.uk of therapy , although in general , they are more severe ( Anonymous , 1995 ) .
Virus-induced changes in drug metabolism and drug detoxification , in particular a change in cellular redox potential , immune dysregulation , drug-drug interactions and drug dosage have all been postulated to be responsible for the increased risk of hypersensitivity in HIV-infected patients ( Carr & Cooper , 1995 ; Pirmohamed & Park , 1995 ) .
It is important to identify the exact mechanism ( s ) of SMX hypersensitivity in HIV-infected patients in order to develop strategies to prevent the reactions and thus improve the tolerability of co-trimox-azole .
SMX is metabolized not only to stable metabolites , such as the N-acetate and glucuronide but also to a potentially toxic hydroxylamine metabolite ( SMX-NHOH ) , which can undergo further oxidation to a nitroso metabolite ( SMX-NO ) .
It has been proposed that SMX-NO is responsible for idiosyncratic toxicity , with the tissue injury occurring via an immune-mediated mechanism ( Rieder et al .
, 1988 ; 1989 ; 1995a , b ; Carr et al .
, 1993 ; Meekins et al .
, 1994 ; Cribb et al .
, 1996b ) .
In an in vivo rat model , both SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO underwent extensive reduction which serves as a detoxication mechanism ( Gill et al .
, 1997 ) , indicating that measurement of urinary concentrations of SMX-NHOH-estimated to be about 2 % of an ingested dose in man ( Gill et a/ .
, 1996 ) -may underestimate 1394 D.J .
Naisbitt et al Sulphamethoxazole binding to cells the total level of tissue exposure to the toxic metabolites .
Therefore , an imbalance between oxidation of SMX and the reduction of its toxic metabolites back to the parent compound may predispose to toxicity .
In order to investigate further the role of metabolism in SMX toxicity , we have investigated the cellular disposition of SMX and its oxidative metabolites in vitro .

( Poole , U.K. ) .
Anti-SMX IgG antibody was kindly donated by Dr A.E .
Cribb ( Merck Research Laboratories , West Point , PA , U.S.A. ) .
SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO were synthesized according to the method of Naisbitt et al .
( 1996 ) and found to be > 99 % pure by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy ( LC-MS ) and NMR ( Bruker , 200 MHz spectrometer ) .
Monopoly resolving medium ( Ficoll Hypaque , 1.114 g ml- ' ) and Lymphoprep ( 1.077 g ml~ `` ) were from ICN Biomedicals ( Bucks .
, U.K. ) and Nycomed ( Birmingham , U.K. ) , respectively .
All HPLC-grade solvents were purchased from Fischer Scientific ( Loughbor-ough , U.K. ) .
Isolation of peripheral blood cells Human neutrophils , lymphocytes and red blood cells were isolated from the heparinized venous blood of ten healthy male volunteers ( aged 19-45 ) on a dual density gradient of Monopoly resolving medium and Lymphoprep , as described previously ( Naisbitt et a/ .
, 1997 ) .
Neutrophils and lymphocytes were resuspended in Dulbecco 's phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ; pH 7.4 ) and diluted to the concentration required for each experiment .
Both cell types were greater than 98 % pure and 97 % viable as assessed by Wright 's stain and trypan blue dye exclusion , respectively .
The isolated red blood cells were washed twice and resuspended in Dulbecco 's PBS to produce a haematocrit of 50 % .
When required , cells were lysed with a sonic probe ( Heat systems , Farmingdale , NY , U.S.A. ; 0°C , 3 x 20 s ) .
Platelet-free plasma was prepared from ice-cold heparinized venous blood by centrifugation at 0°C ( 1200 x g for 10 min ) .
All samples were kept on ice and the experiments were initiated within 25 min of venepuncture .
Thiolation of human serum albumin Human serum albumin ( 200 mg ) was incubated with D.L-thiolactone homocysteine ( 330 mg ) in PBS ( 4 ml , pH 7.4 ) and glycine buffer ( 8 ml , 100 um glycine in 100 uM sodium chloride , 100 um sodium hydroxide ) for 2h at room temperature .
The thiolated albumin was then washed and concentrated using a Centriprep-10 column ( 1500 xg for 2 h ; Amicon , Glos .
, U.K. ) .
The degree of thiolation was determined by the method of Akerboom & Sies ( 1981 ) ; the human serum albumin : thiol ratio increased from 1:0.05-1:42 .
Reaction of sulphamethoxazole , sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine and nitroso sulphamethoxazole with human serum albumin and thiolated human serum albumin Albumin or thiolated albumin ( 100 mg ml- ' ) was incubated with SMX , SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO ( 1- 1000 uM ) in PBS ( pH 7.2 ) for 24 h at 37°C .
Ninety-six well microtitre plates were coated with 100 ug of each incubation ( 100 wl ) in PBS overnight at 4°C .
The plates were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 ( PBS-Tween ) before incubation with anti-SMX IgG antibody ( 1/100 ; 100 wl ) for 1 h at room temperature .
The antibody was raised in rats immunized with SMX-NO alone ( Gill et a/ .
, 1997 ) .
The wells were washed three times with PBS-Tween ; peroxidase-linked anti-rat IgG antibody in PBS ( dilution 1/2500 ; 100 wl ) was then added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The wells were washed again followed by addition of the developing solution ( 0.1 % hydrogen peroxide [ 30 % ] and 400 ug ml~ ' o-phenyle-nediamine dihydrochloride in citrate phosphate buffer [ 0.15 M ; pH 5.0 ] ) to each well .
The reaction was terminated after 20 min by the addition of 25 % sulphuric acid ( 25 ul ) and the optical density determined using an automated microplate reader ( Dynatech MR 600 , Guernsey , U.K. ) at an absorbance of 490 nm .
Haptenation of human white blood cells by sulphamethoxazole , sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine and nitroso sulphamethoxazole Neutrophils or lymphocytes ( 1x 10® ml- ' ) were incubated with SMX , SMX-NHOH or SMX-NO ( 1-1000 um ) in PBS ( pH 7.4 ) in the presence or absence of GSH ( 1 mM ) for 1 h at 37°C .
The control incubations contained the vehicle ( DMSO ) only .
In other experiments , SMX ( 2.5 mM ) was incubated with neutrophils ( 1x10 ' ml- ' ) in the presence of PMA ( 10 ng ml- ' ) , a cell activating factor ( Thompson et al .
, 1989 ) .
Antigen formation on cell surfaces from SMX or its metabolites was determined by flow cytometry as follows .
The drug or vehicle-treated control cells ( 1x 10° ) were washed ( 3 x 1 ml ) in ice-cold PBS ( pH 7.4 ) and centrifuged ( 1100 x g ) prior to incubation with anti-SMX IgG antibody ( 1:500 , 40 ul ) for 30 min at 4°C .
The cells were washed ( 0.5 ml ) to remove unconjugated anti-SMX antibody , and then incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-IgG antibody ( 1:50 , 40 wl ) for a further 30 min at 4°C .
After antibody labelling , the cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and kept on ice prior to analysis using an EPICS-XL flow cytometer ( Coulter Electronics , Luton , Beds .
, U.K. ) .
The fluorescence threshold gating was set to give < 5 % positive cells in the negative control populations .
Greater than 3000 cells per sample were analysed in each case .
The percentage of cells staining positively for SMX was then calculated as the difference from the negative controls .
Assessment of white and red blood cell toxicity of sulphamethoxazole and its hydroxylamine and nitroso metabolites Neutrophil and lymphocyte membrane integrity was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion as described previously ( Pirmohamed et al .
, 1991 ) .
Cells were incubated with SMX , D.J .
Naisbitt et al Sulphamethoxazole binding to cells 1395 SMX-NHOH or SMX-NO ( 1-1000 um ) in Dulbecco 's PBS ( 1 ml , pH 7.4 ) in a shaking water bath at 37°C for 1 h. Data represents the percentage of trypan blue stained cells/total number of cells .
Apoptosis and necrosis are morphologically distinct modes of cell death ( Searle et al .
, 1982 ) .
While apoptosis occurs prior to and at lower toxicant dose than necrotic cell death ( Raffray & Cohen , 1997 ) , cell selectivity of toxicants can stem from the apoptotic and necrotic thresholds at which different cells die , site of bioactivation/detoxification or site of toxicant accumulation .
For these reasons , lymphocyte and neutrophil apoptosis was quantified morphologically and by flow cytometry at lower concentrations than that required to cause necrotic cell death .
Cells ( 1 x 10° ) were incubated with SMX , SMX-NHOH or SMX-NO ( 1-300 uM ) in Dulbecco 's PBS ( pH 7.4 ) .
Drugs were added in DMSO , which as a 1 % solution ( v¥v- ' ) did not induce apoptosis .
Some incubations also contained GSH ( 1 mm ) .
After 2 h , the tubes were centrifuged ( 650 xg ; 10 min ) to pellet the cells .
The supernatants were discarded and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of drug-free Dulbecco 's PBS containing human serum - albumin ( 5 mg ml- ' ) .
Samples were incubated for a further 6 h prior to analysis .
Cells were assessed for characteristic morphologic changes using Wright 's stain .
Stained cells were viewed under a light microscope ( Shandon Elliot , London , U.K. ) for apoptotic structure ( Watson et al .
, 1996b ) .
At least 200 cells were examined .
Flow cytometric evaluation of apoptotic was assessed according to the method originally described by Nicoletti et al .
( 1991 ) .
Cells were pelleted by centrifugation ( 200 x g ; 8 min ) , resuspended in 1 ml of 70 % ethanol ( v v~- ' ) and stored for 30 min at 37°C .
The fixed cell suspensions were then centrifuged , washed with Dulbecco 's PBS ( 1 ml ) and finally resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic fluorochrome solution ( propidium iodide , 50 ug ml~ ' ; sodium citrate , 3.4 mM ; Tris , 1 mM ; EDTA , 100 uM ; RNAse [ type I-Al , 500 ug ml- ' ) .
The cells were kept overnight in the dark ( 4°C ) prior to FACScan analysis on a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , CA , U.S.A. ) .
Propidium iodide fluorescence ( FL-2 ) of individual nuclei was registered on a logarithmic scale .
At least 5000 nuclei were counted and analysed on a Hewlett Packard ( HP 9000 ) computer using Lysis II software .
The ability of SMX , SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO ( 1-300 uM ) to inhibit the neutrophil oxidative burst was determined using the nitroblue tetrazolium slide test and an indirect procedure that involves inhibition of eugenol-induced GSH depletion by the test compounds .
The experimental protocols have been described previously ( Naisbitt et a/ .
, 1997 ) .
Red blood cell toxicity was assessed by measuring the amount of methaemoglobin ( MetHb ) formed when cells ( 50 % haematocrit ) were incubated with SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO , according to the method of Harrison & Jollow ( 1986 ) .
Determination of NF-KB and AP-1 levels in lymphocytes Freshly isolated lymphocytes were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing glutamine ( 2 mM ) and penicillin ( 50 units ml~ `` ) /streptomycin ( 50 ug ml- ' ) at a density of 1-3 x 10° cells ml- ' .
After 24 h cells were incubated in the presence of SMX-NO ( 1-1000 um ) for a further 1 h in cell culture tubes ( 37°C , 5 % CO ; ) .
NF-xB and AP-1 DNA binding activity was determined using the Promega Gel Shift Assay System ( Promega , Southampton , U.K. ) .
The double stranded DNA oligonucleotide probes used contained the following sequences : NF-KB 5-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3 ' AP-1 5-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GTA A-3 ' Oligonucleotide probes were [ y-P ] -ATP ( Amersham International , Amersham , U.K. ) end-labelled with T4 poly-nucleotide kinase .
Binding reactions consisted of nuclear protein ( 2 ug ) , 5x binding buffer and labelled NF-xB or AP-1 oligonucleotide probe ( 50,000 c.p.m . )
.
Competitive mobility shift reactions included unlabelled NF-xB or AP-1 oligonucleotide probe ( 1.75 pmol ) to characterize the DNA binding specificity .
Following incubation for 30 min at room temperature , samples were loaded onto a 6 % polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 2.5 h. The gels were then dried and exposed to photographic film .
The results are expressed as the integrated optical density of each band .
All experiments were carried out with cells from three individuals .
Reaction of sulphamethoxazole , sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine and nitroso sulphamethoxazole with biological thiols To determine the relative importance of intracellular and extracellular thiols in the detoxification of SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO , we investigated their reaction with CYS ( the most abundant extracellular thiol in plasma ; Eck et al .
, 1989 ) , and compared it to their reaction with GSH ( a predominantly intracellular thiol ) , which has been described previously ( Cribb et al .
, 1991 ) .
SMX ( 50 um ) or its metabolites ( SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO ; 50 uM ) were incubated with CYS ( 100 um ) in Dulbecco 's PBS ( 1 ml ) at 37°C for 0.2 , 1 , 8 or 20 h. Aliquots ( 25 ul ) of the reaction mixture were analysed at each time-point by LC-MS , using a previously described protocol ( Gill et a/ .
, 1996 ) .
SMX and SMX-NHOH were identified from authentic standards , whereas any reaction intermediates were identified from their parent molecular ion peak and retention times quoted previously ( Naisbitt et a/ .
, 1996 ) .

Naisbitt et al Sulphamethoxazole binding to cells Two major difficulties were encountered with the use of LC-MS. Firstly , the concentration of SMX-NO throughout the reaction could not be measured because it only produces a very weak protonated molecule ; and second , absolute quantification of the amounts of products formed is not possible .
To overcome these problems , the reactions of SMX , SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO ( 10 mm ) with CYS in d , -DMSO were analysed by proton NMR .
DMSO as a solvent has the added advantage of stabilizing SMX-NHOH , thus allowing the analysis of reaction intermediates over a longer time period ( i.e .
, 96 h ; Naisbitt et al .
, 1996 ) .
The amount of each intermediate formed was quantified by measurement of the integral peak height from each spectrum throughout the reaction period .
All reaction intermediates were identified from NMR spectra of standard compounds .
The reactions of SMX , SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO with CYS and GSH were also determined by fluorescence HPLC .

The reaction between SMX-NO ( 30 um ) and a mixture of CYS ( 10 um ) and GSH ( 10 uM ) in Dulbecco 's PBS was analysed by a similar method .
Incubations were carried out at 37°C and thiol levels were measured at intervals between 0-60 min .
Depletion of glutathione and cysteine from neutrophils , lymphocytes and plasma Intact or lysed peripheral white blood cells ( 0.5 x 10° cells/ incubation ) were incubated ( final volume 1 ml ) in Dulbecco 's PBS at 37°C for 1 h with SMX , SMX-NHOH or SMX-NO ( 1 400 um ) .
The experiments with neutrophils were performed both in the presence and absence of PMA ( 10 ng ml- ' ) .

Naisbitt et al Sulphamethoxazole binding to cells 1397 stimulates the neutrophil respiratory burst , a phenomena known to oxidize almost any compound with an easily oxidizable functional group ( Uetrecht , 1992 ) .
Protein was precipitated by the addition of 100 % trichloroacetic acid ( 10 wl ) and thiol levels were measured using bromobimane ( Cotgreave & Moldeus , 1986 ; Pirmohamed et al .
, 1996 ) .
Plasma thiol depletion was analysed by a similar method except that 1 ml of ice-cold plasma was added to each incubation instead of the cells .
The basal levels of the thiols were measured prior to the incubation and in the absence of any of the compounds .
Additionally , thiol stability after isolation of the plasma and cells was assessed between 0-5 h. The results are presented as the mean of three separate incubations conducted in triplicate .
GSH and CYS standard curves were constructed between 0.5 and 50 um .
Reduction of sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine and nitroso sulphamethoxazole by the individual components of peripheral blood Isolated neutrophils , lymphocytes ( 5 x 10° cells ) and plasma ( 1 ml ) were incubated with SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO ( 30 um ) in a shaking water bath at 37°C in Dulbecco 's PBS ( pH 7.4 ) .
The neutrophil incubations were carried out in the presence or absence of PMA ( 10 ng ml- ' ) .
After 1 h , the reaction was stopped by placing the tubes on ice .
The internal standard , dapsone ( 5 uM ) , was added .
In some experiments , neutrophils were lysed by repeated freeze thawing .
Extraction was performed with ethyl acetate ( 2x3 ml ) .
The combined extracts were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen , reconstituted in mobile phase ( 100 wl ) and analysed by HPLC using the system described above .
Further experiments were carried out to investigate the role of nitroso reductase enzymes in the reduction of SMX-NO .
Neutrophils ( 5 x 10°-5 x 10° ) were incubated with SMX-NO ( 30 um ) in a shaking water bath at 37°C in Dulbecco 's PBS ( pH 7.4 ) for 1 h in the presence or absence of the reductase inhibitors salicyl hydroxamate ( 1 mM ) , dicuomarol ( 10 uM ) , neocuproin ( 1 mM ) , or sodium azide ( 1 mM ) ( Somerville et a/ .
, 1995 ) .
SMX-NHOH and SMX formation was measured by HPLC .
Incubations containing red blood cells ( 0.5 ml , 50 % haematocrit ) and SMX-NHOH ( 1-100 um ) or SMX-NO ( 30 um ) were carried out as above and terminated after 1 h by placing the tubes on ice .
Internal standard was added to the samples , and cells were lysed by the addition of 0.5 ml distilled water .
Following extraction with ethyl acetate ( 2 x 3 ml ) , the samples were reconstituted in mobile phase ( 100 ul ) and analysed by HPLC .
SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO were also incubated for 1 h in either Dulbecco 's PBS , ethyl acetate or mobile phase ( 37°C ) , and analysed by HPLC to measure any spontaneous reduction .
All incubations were performed in triplicate using cells from four individuals .
Red blood cell accumulation of sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine and dapsone hydroxylamine Freshly drawn blood from healthy volunteers was collected into potassium-EDTA tubes containing GSH ( 1 mm ) .
GSH was added to stabilize the hydroxylamine and prevent auto-oxidation to the nitroso metabolite ( Mitra et al .
, 1996 ) .
SMX-NHOH ( 10 um ) or dapsone hydroxylamine ( 10 uM ) were incubated with blood ( 0.5 ml ) at 37°C for various times ( 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 and 100 min ) .
Samples were then microcentrifuged for 1 min ( 13,000 xg ) and an aliquot of the plasma was removed into a silanized glass tube into which the internal standard [ SMX ( 5 uM ) for dapsone hydroxylamine incubations and dapsone ( 5 uM ) for SMX-NHOH incubations ] was added .
Extraction was performed using ethyl acetate ( 2 x 3 ml ) .
The solvent was evaporated to dryness and samples were reconstituted in methanol : distilled water ( 1:1 vyv~ ' ) containing GSH ( 1 mm ) , and analysed using HPLC with UV ( Gill et al .
, 1996 ) and electrochemical detection ( Antdec Decade Electrochemical Detector , Protech Scientific Ltd , Manchester , U.K. ) .
The limit of detection was 0.025 nmole ( dapsone hydroxylamine ) and 0.08 nmole ( SMX-NHOH ) for UV detection and 1 pmole ( dapsone hydroxylamine and SMX-NHOH ) for electrochemical detection .

Naisbitt et al Sulphamethoxazole binding to cells Statistical analysis All values are expressed as the mean +s.d .
All values to be compared were analysed for non-normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test .
Values were often found to be non-normally distributed , and therefore , the Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of the two groups , accepting P < 0.05 as significant .
Results Haptenation of human serum albumin by sulphamethoxazole and its metabolites Incubation of human serum albumin with SMX , SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO did not result in significant binding at any of the concentrations tested .
There was a concentration-dependent increase in binding to thiolated albumin with both SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO ( Figure 1 ) , while SMX itself only showed binding at the highest concentration ( 1000 um ) tested .
Flow cytometric analysis of cellular haptenation by sulphamethoxazole and its metabolites Haptenation of SMX , SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO to cell surfaces was determined by flow cytometry .
Incubation of cells ( both lymphocytes and neutrophils ) with SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in surface antigen formation ( Figure 2 ) .
In contrast , there was no detectable antigen formation when SMX ( 1-1000 um ) was incubated with cells .

Cellular toxicity of sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine and nitroso sulphamethoxazole The toxicity of the oxidative metabolites of SMX was assessed in neutrophils , lymphocytes and red blood cells .
In neutrophils , we assessed both functional and structural toxicity .
Both SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of neutrophil function as assessed by the nitroblue tetrazolium slide test and inhibition of eugenol-induced GSH depletion ( Figure 3a and b ) , while the parent compound had no effect .

The concentration of SMX-NO could not be measured by LC-MS , while DMSO enhances the stability of SMX-NHOH ( see text ) .
Cell death was initially assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion as a measure of membrane integrity .
Death of neutrophils after a 1 h incubation above background values ( < 5 % ) was only seen with 1000 um SMX-NO ( 7.3 +1.0 % ) , but not with SMX or SMX-NHOH .
Lymphocytes in contrast to neutrophils were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) more sensitive to the direct cytotoxic effects of SMX-NO ( 1000 um ) with 46.8 +2.8 % cells unable to exclude trypan blue after a 1 h incubation ( P < 0.05 when compared to a background value of < 5 % ) .
In order to determine the mode of cell death , we went on to investigate whether these metabolites induced apoptosis .
Freshly isolated neutrophils have a limited life span , after which time they die by apoptosis .
The background rate of apoptosis was equivalent to previous studies ( Cox , 1995 ; Watson et al .
, 1996a ) .
Both SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO ( 100-300 um ) increased the rate of spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis as assessed by flow cytometry ( Figure 4a ) and morphological evaluation ( data not shown ) .
This was reduced to background values on incubation with GSH ( 1 mm ; data not shown ) .
No apoptosis was observed with SMX ( 1-300 um ) or lower concentrations of SMX-NHOH ( 1-30 um ) and SMX-NO ( 1-30 um ) .
Figure 4b illustrates a typical trace obtained from the flow cytometer in the presence and absence of SMX-NO ( 300 um ) .
Lymphocytes in contrast , did not undergo apoptosis .
Red blood cell toxicity was assessed by measurement of MetHb .
MetHb formation with SMX-NHOH was concentra-tion-dependent , with 26.1 +6.4 % ( control , 1.2 + 1.0 % ) MetHb being observed at the highest concentration studied ( 100 um SMX-NHOH ) .
MetHb formation after incubation of red blood cells with SMX-NO ( 30 um ; 4.9+0.8 % ) was lower ( P < 0.05 ) than that observed with an equimolar concentration of SMX-NHOH ( 10.2+3.1 % ) .
Effect of nitroso sulphamethoxazole on redox sensitive transcription factors NF-xB and AP-1 in mononuclear leukocytes SMX-NO ( 1000 um ) caused a decrease in basal levels of NF-kB in lymphocytes after 1h ( control , 1779+213 arbitrary units ; drug treated , 968 +359 arbitrary units ; P < 0.05 ) .
In contrast , incubation of SMX-NO ( 1000 um ) with these cells produced a strong induction of AP-1 ( control , 242+193 arbitrary units ; drug treated , 1157 +196 arbitrary units ; P < 0.05 ) .
Neither NF-xB nor AP-1 levels were altered at lower SMX-NO concentrations ( 1100 um ) .
Reaction of sulphamethoxazole , sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine and nitroso sulphamethoxazole with thiols Figure 5a and b show the reaction of SMX-NO with CYS analysed by LC-MS and NMR , respectively .
The initial product was SMX-NHOH ; this largely ( 95 % ) underwent further reduction to SMX during the first 8 h of the incubation .
Semi-mercaptal and sulphonamide conjugates which are formed when SMX-NO reacts with GSH and other biological thiols ( Cribb et al .
, 1991 ; Naisbitt et al .

SMX was the only product when SMX-NHOH and CYS were incubated in buffer ( results not shown ) .

Naisbitt et al Sulphamethoxazole binding to cells ( 3 um ) ( Figure Ga and b ) , while SMX had no effect .
The reaction between SMX-NO ( 30 um ) and CYS ( 10 um ) was rapid resulting in 92.4+3.2 % depletion within 1 min .
In contrast , the reaction with GSH was significantly slower than with CYS ( P < 0.05 ) , with 63.6+5.4 % depletion being observed after 1 min .
CYS was completely depleted after 10 min , while a significant amount of GSH remained for a further 20 min .
Thiol depletion from human neutrophils , lymphocytes and plasma by sulphamethoxazole and its metabolites The basal intracellular GSH concentration measured in 20 individuals ( 3.2-5.6 nmoles/10® cells ) was similar to that reported previously ( Cotgreave & Moldeus , 1986 ; Pirmohamed et al .

CYS was present almost exclusively in a Cysteine ( % ) \ -- t 0 1 10 Concentration ( uM ) Glutathione ( % ) NJ O plasma , with control values ( 7.1-15.0 uM , measured in ten individuals ) again being similar to those reported previously ( Mills & Lang , 1996 ) .
In control incubations , there was no significant decrease in either the CYS or GSH levels for the duration of the experiment ( 1 h ) , although 2.5 h after cell isolation , CYS levels were reduced by 24-37 % .
Neither SMX-NHOH nor SMX-NO ( up to 400 uM ) depleted GSH in PMA-stimulated and unstimulated neutrophils .
In contrast , GSH depletion ( P < 0.05 ) was observed in lymphocytes with both SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO at concentrations of 10 uM or greater .
GSH depletion was significantly greater when neutrophils were lysed than when they were intact ( P < 0.05 ) ; the concentration of SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO which caused 50 % depletion in lysed cells was 11.1 +1.4 um and 2.9+0.6 uM , respectively , and greater than 90 % depletion was observed at 30 uM ( Figure 7a and b ) .

or solvent .
All components of peripheral blood were able to reduce SMX-NHOH to SMX , and SMX-NO to the SMX-NHOH and SMX ( Table 1 ) .
Intact neutrophils , lymphocytes and plasma were equipotent at reducing the nitroso metabolite back to the hydroxylamine , while red blood cells were most potent at reducing SMX-NHOH back to SMX .
Lysis of neutrophils decreased the capacity for reduction of SMX-NO to SMX-NHOH by 12-16 fold .
SMX is converted to the electrophilic hydroxylamine metabolite in neutrophils ( Cribb et al .
, 1990 ) .
The reaction is thought to be catalyzed by myeloperoxidase .
In vitro activation of myeloperoxidase requires an artificial stimuli such as phorbol esters or fMLP .
In this study PMA did not affect the cells capacity for reduction .
The reduction of SMX-NO to SMX-NHOH was dependent on cell concentration , with less than 20 % reduction being observed at 0.5 x 10° neutrophils/ml ( Figure 8a ) .
Salicyl hydroxamate , dicoumarol and sodium azide caused a significant decrease in the reduction of SMX-NO to SMX-NHOH ( P < 0.05 ) , while neocuprin had no effect ( Figure 8b ) .
The inhibitors had no effect on SMX formation .
Accumulation of sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine and dapsone hydroxylamine into red blood cells Dapsone hydroxylamine was taken up rapidly into the red blood cells , with 92.9+0.8 % partitioning into the cells over 90 min .
In comparison , the amount of SMX-NHOH taken up into red cells significantly ( P < 0.05 ) lower ( 33.1+13.1 % ; Figure 9 ) .
Discussion The demonstration of cell-mediated immunity ( Mauri-Hellweg et al .
, 1995 ) and anti-SMX antibodies ( Daftarian et al .
, 1995 ) in hypersensitive patients and the presence of SMX-substituted proteins in patient sera ( Meekins et a/ .
, 1994 ) are indicative of an immune pathogenesis for the toxicity associated with the drug .
Bioactivation of SMX to the hydroxylamine and thence to the nitroso metabolite is thought to be the initial step in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions ( Rieder et a/ .
, 1995a , b ; 1988 ; Carr et al .
, 1993 ) , with subsequent formation of drug-associated antigen by drug-protein conjugation .
Alternatively it has been postulated that the drug , or drug metabolite , exerts a direct immunotoxic effect on cells to produce a hypersensitivity reaction ( Schnyder et al .
, 1997 ) .
We have therefore explored the relationship between drug-antigen formation , drug ( metabolite ) disposition , and cell-function , by use of % Reduction N=O~-NH N=O0-NHOH 1.8+0.6 35.3+3.6 1.7+0.4 41.0 +7.2 7.8+0.6 3.2+2.6 2.8 +0.5 49.3 + 5.4 7.9+0.3 3.1 +0.3 6.2+1.3 17.2+3.6 16.3+3.6 45.0 + 10.3 g ) SMX-NHOH formation ( % ) 1 2 3 4 5 Neutrophil number ( x108/ml ) T SMX-NHOH formation ( % ) Figure 8 ( a ) Reduction of SMX-NO to SMX-NHOH by neutrophils ( 0.005-5 x 10° ml- ' ) in Dulbecco 's PBS .

two accessible human cell types , neutrophils and lymphocytes .
Use of flow cytometry , in conjunction with a specific anti-SMX antibody , clearly demonstrated the ability of both SMX-NHOH and SMX-NO , but not SMX itself , to bind to the outer surface of neutrophils and lymphocytes in a concentration-dependent fashion .
Haptenation was greater with SMX-NO .
Binding of SMX-NHOH is presumed to involve autoxidation to SMX-NO ( Cribb et al .
, 1991 ) which can react with CYS but not with other amino acids ( Naisbitt et al .
, 1996 ) .
In contrast , there was detectable binding to albumin only when the protein was chemically modified to increase its free thiol content .
Furthermore , an increase in extracellular GSH ( or CYS ) blocked cell-haptenation by SMX-NO .
Cell-surface haptenation was detectable after exposure to drug metabolite concentrations of 10 um which may occur after a therapeutic dose of SMX ( Mitra et al .
, 1996 ) .
Our results are in accordance with the finding that there are high levels of protein thiols expressed extracellularly in cells such as lymphocytes ( Lawrence et al .
, 1997 ) .
It is important to note that haptenation can occur without loss of cell membrane integrity , depletion of intracellular GSH or detectable perturbation of redox sensitive transcription factors .
The evidence for this is 3 fold .
First , the system used to detect cell-surface haptenation will distinguish between viable and non-viable cells , and haptenation was clearly occurring on viable cells .
Second , although SMX-NO and SMX-NHOH are toxic to lymphocytes , loss of membrane integrity was only observed at concentrations of 100 uM and greater .
In addition , concentrations of SMX-NO required to induce apoptosis ( 100-300 um ) and necrosis ( 1000 uM ) in neutrophils , are likely to be outside the range achieved with therapeutic doses of SMX .
Lymphocytes were more sensitive to the direct cytotoxic effects of SMX-NO , but did not undergo apoptosis .
The differential extent of toxicity in neutrophils and lymphocytes may be related to the significant GSH depletion observed with high concentrations of SMX-NO in lymphocytes .
SMX itself was non-toxic to either cell type .
Third , we investigated the effect on the redox sensitive transcription factors , AP-1 and NF-xB , known to be modified under situations of cellular stress and initiation of an immune response ( Angel & Karin , 1991 ; Bacuerle & Henkel , 1994 ) .
Although SMX-NO did cause changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the AP-1 and NF-xB probes , consistent with altered protein binding , these changes only occurred at concentrations above those seen therapeutically ( i.e .
, 1000 um ) and appeared to coincide with perturbation of membrane integrity .
Similar results have been reported in the liver , after administration of hepatotoxic doses of paracetamol to mice ( Blazka et al .
, 1996 ; 1997 ) .
These findings show that SMX-NO can haptenate cells without loss of viability .
Such viable cell-drug conjugates can function as a potent antigenic stimulus in vivo .
For example , dinitrophenyl conjugated to lymphocytes at extremely low hapten densities was shown to elicit hypersensitivity reactions to a significantly greater extent than similar amounts of dinitrophenyl conjugated to serum proteins ( Sjoeberg et al .
, 1978 ) .
Additionally , lymphocytes pre-treated with the reactive metabolite of halothane , were found to be highly immunogenic when administered to rabbits ( Hastings et al .
, 1995 ) .
Conjugation of external cellular proteins may lead to internalization , antigen processing and , ultimately , to presentation of drug-peptide conjugates which are then recognized by specific CD8 * T-cells ( Park et al .
, 1998 ) , thus providing a mechanism for drug hypersensitivity reactions .
Haptenation of viable cells is essential for each of these processes to function unimpaired .
The ability of SMX , and its oxidative metabolites to interact selectively with target cells , will be partly dependent on the balance between various pathways of drug metabolism .
In the liver , acetylation and glucuronidation represent direct detoxification processes whereas N-hydroxylation represents bioac-tivation .
Accordingly , relative dysfunction of either of these phase II biotransformations may predispose to drug toxicity ( Shear et al .
, 1986 ) .
Although the liver is the major site of hydroxylamine formation , hepatotoxicity is only rarely associated with SMX ( Cribb et al .
, 1996a ) .
GSH and the GSH transferase enzymes are known to be important in the prevention of severe hepatotoxicity .
The fact that GSH levels in the liver are higher than in other cells may explain why SMX-induced hepatotoxicity is rarely observed in the clinical situation .
Chemically reactive products of oxidative drug metabolism generally have a short biological half-life and are not expected to reach significant concentrations at a site distant from where they are formed .
The hydroxylamine can be detected in plasma , while SMX-NO can not , reflecting the instability and shorter half-life of the latter .
1404 D.J .
Naisbitt et al Sulphamethoxazole binding to cells There is extensive reduction of both SMX-NO and SMX-NHOH in in vivo animal models ( Gill et al .
, 1997 ) .
We have shown that SMX-NO undergoes reduction in plasma , with concomitant depletion of thiols in vitro .
Thus , plasma concentrations of CYS , the major circulating thiol [ total levels reach 300 um ( Mills & Land , 1996 ) ] in blood may normally play a role in preventing the autoxidation of circulating SMX-NHOH to a protein-reactive species in vivo .
Conversely , a disease-induced depletion of plasma thiols , as observed in HIV-positive patients ( Eck et al .
, 1989 ; Staal et al .
, 1992 ; Helbling et al .
, 1996 ; Walmsley et al .
, 1997 ) , will increase the possibility of cell-surface haptenation and thus provide one reason for the greatly increased incidence of SMX hypersensitivity in this group of patients .
The results of our previous study demonstrated that intracellular thiols , principally GSH , can effect reduction of SMX-NO ( to both SMX and SMX-NHOH ) by a non-enzymatic process ( Naisbitt et al .
, 1996 ) .
The spontaneous reaction of thiols with hydroxylamines and nitroso-derivatives is dependent on thiol concentration , pH and the electronic properties of the aromatic ring substituents of the drug ( Ellis et al .
, 1992 ) .
The reaction is initiated by nucleophilic attack by GSH on the nitroso moiety resulting in the formation of an unstable semi-mercaptal intermediate which , depending on the conditions , can yield either a stable sulphonamide conjugate , a hydroxylamine or the parent amine ( Cribb et al .
, 1991 ; Naisbitt et al .
, 1996 ) .
The experiments undertaken in this study show that CYS is also capable of rapid and complete reduction of SMX-NO .
Indeed , the rate of reaction was more rapid than that observed with equimolar concentrations of GSH .
In contrast to the reaction with GSH which produced a complex series of reaction intermediates , no thiol conjugates were identified .
However , the mechanism of reduction is likely to be similar .
The thiol/thiolate ion ratio of GSH and CYS at physiological pH [ approximately 63:1 ( GSH/GS~ ) ; 8 : 1 ( CYS/CYS~ ) ] may explain the lack of conjugate formation and enhanced reactivity of CYS towards SMX-NO ( Kosower & Kosower , 1976 ) .
These findings have been observed by other groups working with reactive electrophiles such as quinones , diethyl maleate and diethyl fumarate ( Murty & Penning , 1992 ; Kubal et al .
, 1995 ) .
Kubal et al .
( 1995 ) suggested that donation of a proton from the amine group of CYS may enhance product formation , while in turn the amide linkage between CYS and glutamate in GSH may result in stabilization of the intermediate products of conjugation .
Intracellular reduction of SMX-NO could provide an important cellular defence mechanism against the direct toxic effects of the metabolite .
We therefore examined the metabolism of SMX-NO by both lymphocytes and neutrophils .
- Cell-concentration dependent reduction of SMX-NO to SMX-NHOH was observed without depletion of intracellular GSH .
SMX was not formed in the reaction .
The reduction was blocked to some extent by specific inhibitors of alcohol dehydrogenase ( salicy !

Defence mechanisms involving reduction of the reactive metabolites back to the parent compound , either enzymatically or by thiol compounds , are also indicated .

Naisbitt et al Sulphamethoxazole binding to cells 1405 dicoumarol and sodium azide ) ( Somerville et a/ .
, 1995 ) , an enzyme previously characterized in human neutrophils ( Gotoh et al .
, 1989 ) .
Based on reductase activity and inhibitor studies , Kuwada et al .
( 1980 ) and others ( Horie & Ogura , 1980 ) have also demonstrated alcohol dehydro-genase-dependent C-nitroso reduction .
In contrast , when cells were lysed there was extensive consumption of GSH and reduction of SMX-NO to the parent amine was observed .
Thus a combination of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic processes may serve to protect cells from intracellular chemical damage from SMX-NO .
These findings identify an important extrahepatic detoxification mechanism , which if deficient , may determine susceptibility to SMX hypersensitivity .
Previous studies have demonstrated that hepatic enzymes can also effect the reduction of SMX-NHOH to SMX ( Cribb et a/ .
, 1995 ) ; an NADH-dependent hydroxylamine reductase is responsible .
Finally , there is the question of cellular accumulation .
SMX accumulates in white cells , with intracellular levels increasing by up to 130 fold in infected neutrophils compared with resting cells ( Climax et al .
, 1986 ) .
Intracellular accumulation , together with inhibition of neutrophil function as assessed by inhibition of eugenol-induced GSH depletion and inhibition of oxidative metabolism , may be of importance for the antimicrobial activity of SMX .
Previous studies by our group have shown that red blood cells selectively accumulate dapsone hydroxylamine ( Tingle & Park , 1993 ) , thus providing an explanation for the cell-selective toxicity observed with this drug ; i.e .
, MetHb and oxidative haemolysis .
Indeed , circulating plasma levels of dapsone hydroxylamine can not be detected ( Rhodes et al .
, 1995 ) and there is little exposure of peripheral white blood cells to this toxic metabolite .
By contrast , SMX-NHOH is not taken up avidly by red blood cells .
Therefore , the differential uptake by red blood cells of dapsone hydro- References AKERBOOM , T.P.M .

In conclusion , we have demonstrated in an in vitro model , the propensity of a metabolite of SMX , SMX-NO , to haptenate cell-surface proteins on viable cells .
In addition , we have found that under normal physiological conditions a number of processes would serve to prevent such chemical modification of autologous cells , with endogenous thiols playing a key role in drug metabolite detoxication ( Figure 10 ) .
However , if the normal balance between drug bioactivation and metabolite bioinactivation , both hepatic and peripheral , is disturbed , haptenation of cell surfaces could lead to an immune response .
Such observations are of particular relevance to AIDS patients who require treatment with this drug despite its adverse reaction profile , and in whom the detoxication processes of glucuronidation ( Esteban et al .
, 1997 ) , acetylation ( Lee et al .
, 1993 ) and reduction by thiols ( Naisbitt et al .
, unpublished observation ) are known to be impaired .
Studies are underway to measure cell haptenation in such patients with , and without , hypersensitivity .
