RAPID COMMUNICATION Distinctive Expression Pattern of the BCL-6 Protein in Nodular Lymphocyte Predominance Hodgkin 's Disease By Brunangelo Falini , Barbara Bigerna , Laura Pasqualucci , Marco Fizzotti , Massimo F. Martelli , Stefano Pileri , Antonio Pinto , Antonino Carbone , Stefania Venturi , Roberta Pacini , Giorgio Cattoretti , Edoardo Pescarmona , Francesco Lo Coco , Pier-Giuseppe Pelicci , loannis Anagnastopoulos , Riccardo Dalla-Favera , and Leonardo Flenghi The BCL-6 gene encoding a nuclear-located Kruppel-type zinc finger protein is rearranged in about 30 % diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and is expressed predominantly in normal germinal center B cells and related lymphomas .
These findings suggest that BCL-6 may play a role in regulating differentiation of normal germinal center B cells and that its deregulated expression caused by rearrangements may contribute to lymphomagenesis .
This prompted us to investigate the expression of the BCL-6 protein in Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) , focusing on the nodular lymphocyte predominance subtype ( NLPHD ) , which differs from classical HD by virtue of the B-cell nature of the malignant cell population { so-called L & H cells ) and its relationship with germinal cen-ters .
Forty-one HD samples ( 19 NLPHD , 12 nodular sclerosis , and 10 mixed cellularity ) were immunostained with the monoclonal antibodies PG-B6 and PG-B6p that react with HE BCL-6 GENE IS frequently involved in translocations affecting band 3q27'* and is found rearranged in about 30 % non-Hodgkin lymphomas of diffuse large B-cell type ( DLCL-B ) and in a small fraction of follicular lympho-mas . ``
The BCL-6 gene encodes a protein of 706 amino acids that has homologies with members of the Kruppel-like sub-family of zinc finger proteins , `` many of which have been implicated in developmental regulation . ``
Immunohistologic studies of normal lymphoid tissues with specific poly-clonal®* `` `` and monoclonal antibodies ( MoAbs ) `` have provided evidence that BCL-6 is a nuclear-located protein preferentially expressed in virtually all germinal center B cells ( centroblasts and centrocytes ) of the secondary follicles .
This finding strongly suggests that BCL-6 may be involved in the regulation of B-cell differentiation occurring within the germinal centers of peripheral lymphoid organs . ``
Among non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas , the BCL-6 protein is mainly expressed on those B-cell subtypes presumably derived from germinal center B cells ( follicular lymphomas and DLCL-B ) .
In these tumors , the BCL-6 gene is expressed independently of the presence of rearrangements . ``
'' ' In those cases carrying rearrangements , BCL-6 expression is driven by heterologous promoters , suggesting that it may be deregu-lated . ``
Given the restricted expression of BCL-6 to germinal center B cells , we were particularly interested to study the distribution of this protein in nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin 's disease ( NLPHD ) , which differs from other subtypes of Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) by virtue of the B-cell nature of the tumor component ( so-called L & H cells ) and its relationship with germinal centers . '
'' * `` `` For this purpose , tissue sections from different subtypes of HD were immunostained with two MoAbs , PG-B6 `` and PG-B6p , `` ° that react with a fixative-sensitive and fixative-resistant epitope on the aminoterminal region of human BCL-6 protein , respectively .
Blood , Vol 87 , No 2 ( January 15 ) , 1996 : pp 465-471 a fixative-sensitive and a formalin-resistant epitope on the aminoterminal region of the BCL-6 gene product , respectively .
Strong nuclear positivity for the BCL-6 protein was detected in tumor ( L & H ) cells in all cases of NLPHD .
In contrast , BCL-6 was expressed only in a small percentage of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells in about 30 % of classical HD cases .
Notably , the nuclei of reactive CD3*/CD4* T cells nearby to and rosetting around L & H cells in NLPHD were also strongly BCL-6* , but lacked CD40 ligand ( CD4O0L ) expres-sion .
This staining pattern clearly differed from that of classical HD , whose cellular background was made up of CD3*/ CD4* T cells showing the BCL-6~/CD40L* phenotype .
These results further support the concept that NLPHD is an histo-genetically distinct , B-cell-derived subtype of HD and suggest a role for BCL-6 in its development .

We provide in this report immunohistological evidence for a distinctive expression pattern of the BCL-6 protein in NLPHD as compared with the mixed cellularity ( MC ) and nodular sclerosis ( NS ) HD subtypes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies The BCL-6 protein was detected by using the MoAbs PG-B6 and PG-B6p that have been recently generated in the laboratory of one of the investigators ( B.F. ) by immunizing BALB/c mice with a glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -BCL6-fusion protein . '
'' * Both antibodies are directed against the aminoterminal portion of the human BCL-6 gene product , but probably recognize different epitopes .
In fact , PG-B6 and PG-B6p show the same immunostaining pattern in fresh samples , but only the MoAb PG-B6p allows detection of BCL6 in microwave-heated paraffin sections . ``

466 clonal anti~BCL-6 antibodies .
The polyclonal antibody N-70-6 ( anti-N-terminus ) was raised in the laboratory of one of the investigators ( R.D.F . )
and has been previously described . ``
BCL-6 ( N-3 ) is an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against a GST -tagged fusion protein containing sequences corresponding to amino acids 3-484 mapping within the aminoterminal two-thirds of BCL-6 of human origin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
All HD cases were also immunostained for the following antigens : CD3 ( DAKO-T3 and polyclonal anti-CD3 ) , CD15 , CD20 ( MoAb L26 ) , `` `` and follicular dendritic cells ( MoAb R4/23 ) , all purchased from Dako ( Glostrup , Denmark ) ; CD4 ( MoAb OKT4 ; Ortho Diagnostic System , Milan , Italy ) ; CD79a ( MoAb mb-1 : kindly provided by D.Y .
Mason , Oxford , UK ) `` ; CD30 ( MoAb Ber-H2 ) , `` `` the prolif-eration-associated antigen recognized by MoAb Ki-67 `` `` ; and CD57 ( MoAb Leu-7 ; Becton Dickinson ) .
The CD40L was detected with the MoAb M90 ( kindly provided by R.J. Armitage , Immunex R & D Corp , Seattle , WA ) .
Tissue Samples Immunohistological studies were performed on 41 HD cases ( 19 NLPHD , 12 NSHD , and 10 MCHD ) that were classified according to Rye modification of the Lukes and Butler classification . ``
' Frozen lymph node samples were available in 36 cases .
These specimens had been collected during the period between 1990 and 1994 and were stored in the tissue banks of Perugia , Bologna and Rome Universities and the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico , Aviano , Italy .
Paraffin blocks from the same cases were also available for immunohistologic studies .
Five cases of NLPHD could only be studied in paraffin sections .
Tissue Processing Frozen tissue blocks were cut in a cryostat and frozen sections ( 5-um thick ) were air-dried overnight , fixed in acetone for 10 minutes , and either immunostained immediately or stored at -20°C until immunostaining . ``
Paraffin sections were cut at 5 um , mounted on silane-coated slides , and dried overnight at 37°C .
Sections were then dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated through gradient alcohols .
Rehydrated slides were placed in covered glass Coplin jars filled with 1 mmol/L EDTA buffer , pH 8.0 .
** The jars were incubated three times for 5 minutes at 700 W in a De Longhi microwave oven .
After microwave irradia-tion , the sections were allowed to cool down to room temperature for approximately 20 minutes , washed with Tris-buffered saline , and stained with the PG-B6p MoAb as described below .
Single and Double Immunoenzymatic Staining Labeling of frozen and paraffin sections with MoAbs was performed by the immunoalkaline phosphatase ( APAAP ) technique , as previously described . ``
The polyclonal anti-CD3 and anti-BCL-6 antibodies were detected by a four-stage APAAP technique , as previously described . ``
The alkaline phosphatase reaction was shown by the new Fuchsin substrate . ``
The endogenous alkaline phosphatase was blocked by adding levamisole to the substrate solution at the final concentration of 1 mmoV/L . ``
Slides were then counter-stained for 5 minutes in Gill 's hematoxylin and mounted in Kaiser 's gelatin .
Tissue frozen sections from 10 cases of NLPHD and 5 classical HD ( 3 NSHD and 2 MCHD ) were double-stained for the following pairs of antigens : BCL-6/CD30 , BCL-6/CD20 , BCL-6/CD3 , and BCL-6/CD57 .
Double immunoenzymatic labeling was performed as previously described . ``
Briefly , the PG-B6p MoAb was detected by a rabbit antimouse Ig followed by mouse PAP complexes ( both purchased from Dako ) .
After three washes in Tris-buffered saline , FALINI ET AL MoAbs directed against the second pairs of antigens were applied to the sections and detected by the three-stage APAAP technique , `` `` as described above .
Assessment of BCL-6 Staining in HD Samples BCL-6 expression in neoplastic cells .
At least 100 neoplastic cells/per section , as defined by histologic and immunohistologic criteria ( positivity for CD30 ) , were counted by three of us ( B.F. , S.P .
, and LF . )
.
The percentage of BCL-6* neoplastic cells was assigned into one of the following categories : 0 , less than 10 % , 10 % to 25 % , 25 % to 50 % , 50 % to 75 % , and greater than 75 % .
Only definite unambiguous staining on unequivocal malignant cells was accepted as positive .
The distribution ( nuclear , cytoplasmic , or both ) and the pattern of BCL-6 staining ( speckled v diffuse ) was also recorded .
BCL-6 expression in the reactive T-cell component .
| In each HD sample , we assessed the following parameters : ( 1 ) the total of T lymphocytes showing nuclear expression of BCL-6 ; and ( 2 ) the percentage of neoplastic cells ringed by BCL-6* T lymphocytes .
In each case , three to five representative fields were examined using a x25 objective .
The average of three values was used as the final value for each case .
In samples of NLPHD and NSHD , tumor nodules were analyzed .
In cases of MCHD that showed a diffuse archi-tecture , representative fields were examined .
To assess the percentage of neoplastic cells ringed by BCL-6* T cells , we counted in each section the number of ringed tumor cells and the total number of tumor cells ( ringed and nonringed ) and determined the fraction of ringed cells over the total .
Ten high-power fields ( covering 5 tumor nodules in NLPHD and NSHD ) were examined in each case .
A ringed tumor cell was defined as one in which greater than 50 % of the cell 's circumference was occupied by BCL-6* lymphocytes .
The staining pattern of BCL-6 was compared with that of CD3 , CD4 , and CD57 ( Leu7 ) molecules ( assessed according to the above criteria in serial frozen sections ) .
In 10 NLPHD and 5 classical HD , double immunoenzymatic labeling was also performed to confirm the findings .
Expression of the BCL-6 Protein on CD4O0L-Bearing T Cells The relationship between BCL-6 and CD4OL expression was studied both in tissue sections of HD and normal activated peripheral blood T cells .
For this purpose , peripheral CD4 * T cells from normal donors were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation followed by negative selection with anti-CD19 plus anti-CD8 immunomagnetic beads , as previously described , `` and activated to express CDA4OL by exposure to TPA ( 10 ng/mL ) and ionomycin ( 1 pg/mL ) for 8 hours . ``
'' Purified cells were assayed by flow cytometry for expression of BCL-6 and CD4O0L . ``
To detect BCL-6 expression , cells were previously fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) for 15 minutes at 4°C and permealized in 70 % methanol for 30 minutes at 4°C .
The expression pattern of the BCL-6 and CD4O0L ( MoAb M90 ) in CD4* T cells was also studied in serial frozen sections from four cases of NLPHD .
A subclone of the Jurkat human T-cell line that constitutively express the CD4O0L® served as positive control for the APAAP immunostaining procedure .

2 .
The majority of neoplastic ( L & H ) cells ( range , 75 % to 100 % ) from all cases of NLPHD showed strong nuclear expression of the BCL-6 protein ( Table 2 and Fig 1A through E ) .
The nuclei of tumor cells appeared homogeneously positive ( Fig 1B , D , and E ) ; there was no evidence of cytoplasmic labeling .
The nuclear staining pattern of tumor cells was comparable to that of germinal center B cells in entrapped secondary follicles ( data not shown ) .
There was no difference between the results obtained in frozen ( Fig 1B ) and microwave-heated paraffin sections stained with the PG-B6p MoAb ( Fig 1D and E ) .
The strong nuclear positivity of neoplastic cells was completely abolished by preabsorbing the PG-B6 and PG-B6p supernatants with excess GST-BCL-6 fusion protein that was used as immunogen .
In contrast , a persistant nuclear staining was observed when the antibodies were preabsorbed with an unrelated nuclear-associated protein ( PML ) .
Results comparable to those reported above were obtained in 10 NLPHD stained in parallel with the anti-BCL-6 polyclonal antibodies N-70-6 and N-3 .
However , the intensity of labeling was lower than that obtained with the PG-B6 and PG-B6p MoAbs .
BCL-6 expression in reactive T cells .
- Most CD4* T cells ( > 80 % ) within the nodules of NLPHD consistently expressed the BCL-6 protein ( Fig 1B ) , as compared with only occasional scattered BCL-6¢/CD4* T cells in the residual internodular T areas ( data not shown ) .
Nuclear expression of BCL-6 by CD4* T cells was usually lower than that of L & H cells and was more clearly seen in frozen than in paraffin sections .
Notably , the BCL-6+/CD4* T cells in NLPHD were clustered around areas rich in L & H cells and frequently formed rosettes around them ( Fig 1B and D ) .
The rosetting phenomenon was striking within the neoplastic nodules of NLPHD , but only occasionally occurred in the paracortical area .
The median number of tumor cells ringed by BCL-6* T cells was 50 % in NLPHD ( v < 5 % in classical HD ) .
In all NLPHD cases , the percentage of BCL-6+* T cells rosetting around BCL-6+* L & H cells largely outnumbered that of CD57 ( Leu7 ) * cells .
BCL-6 Expression in Other HD Types BCL-6 expression in neoplastic cells Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg ( RS ) cells in more than 70 % NSHD and MCHD cases were BCL-6~ .
This finding was not due to diffusion of the BCL-6 protein outside the nucleus during the cryosectioning procedure , because other nuclear-located antigens stained in parallel ( eg PML and Ki-67 ) were 467 strongly expressed on tumor cells .
Moreover , staining of paraffin sections with the PG-B6p MoAb gave the same results .
BCL-6* neoplastic elements were present in about 30 % cases ( Table 1 ) .
In most of them , the percentage of BCL-6* tumor cells was very low ( about 10 % ) and only in two cases ranged between 25 % and 50 % ( Table 1 and Fig 1F ) .
There was no apparent correlation between BCL-6 expression and phenotype of tumor cells in these cases ( 6 null and 1 B ) .
BCL-6 expression in reactive T cells .
Contrary to the findings observed in NLPHD , CD4* T cells surrounding Hodgkin and RS cells and rosetting around them in cases of NSHD and MCHD were usually BCL-6~ ( data not shown ) .
Correlation Between BCL-6 and CD4OL Expression The finding that CD4* T cells rosetting around L & H cells of NLPHD tissues consistently express BCL-6 prompted us to investigate the relationship between the expression of BCL-6 and that of CD4OL that is thought to be involved in the rosetting phenomenon observed in HD tissues . ``
The expression pattern of BCL-6 and CD4O0L by CD4* T cells in frozen sections from the various subtypes of HD was remarkably different .
Only scattered CD4OL+* T cells were found in the tumor nodules of NLPHD , which conversely contained many BCL-6+/CD4* T cells .
In contrast , T lymphocytes rosetting around Hodgkin and RS cells of NSHD and MCHD were usually BCL-6~/CD40L * ( data not shown ) .

BCL-6 EXPRESSION IN NLPHD 469 BCL-6 CDA40L T= 0 T= 12 Fig 2 .
Kinetic study of BCL-6 and CD4OL expression during in vitro activation of CD4* T cells .
Purified CD4* T cells were cultured in the presence of TPA ( 10 ng/mL ) and ionomycin ( 1 g/mL ) for 12 , 24 , and T= 24 48 hours .
The abscissa indicates the logarithm of the relative intensity of green fluorescence obtained by staining cells with anti-BCL-6 and anti-CD40L MoAbs ( thick lines ) and isotype-matched control Igs ( thin lines ) .
The ordinate indicates relative cell num-bers .
T= 48 In keeping with these immunohistologic findings , we found that the BCL-6 and CD4O0L molecules are differently regulated during in vitro activation of purified normal CD4* T cells by TPA and ionomycin ( Fig 2 ) .
Less than 5 % of resting CD4* T cells expressed BCL-6 or surface CD4O0L , as detected by flow cytometry .
After activation , only a slight increase in BCL-6* T cells was evidenced , with a peak at 12 hours , when 25 % of cells were found to react with the MoAb PG-B6p ( Fig 2 ) .
In contrast , an early induction of CD40L expression was observed after 12 to 24 hours of activation ( up to 55 % of positive cells ) , followed by a return to basal levels ( < 5 % of positive cells ) , by 48 hours ( Fig 2 ) .
DISCUSSION In this report , we provide clear immunohistologic evidence for a distinctive BCL-6 expression pattern in the neoplastic component ( L & H cells ) and the reactive T-cell background of NLPHD as compared with that of NSHD and MCHD subtypes .
Strong expression of BCL-6 in tumor cells of NLPHD could be unequivocally shown by immunocytochemical labeling of paraffin sections with the PG-B6p MoAb and by double immunoenzymatic staining showing coexpression of CD20 , CD30 , and BCL-6 in tumor ( L & H ) cells .
In all cases , the positivity of L & H cells for BCL-6 was restricted to the nuclei with a diffuse/microgranular pattern .
A number of findings indicate that the strong expression of BCL-6 in L & H cells is specific .
Labeling was obtained with two highly specific MoAbs ( PG-B6 and PG-B6p ) both directed against the aminoterminal portion of the BCL-6 protein , ' `` ~ `` `` and it was blocked with the GST-BCL-6 fusion protein used as immunogen .
The possibility that the positive reaction may have been due to labeling of an antigenic epitope shared by a molecule other than BCL-6 present in the nucleus of L & H cells is unlikely , because the same immunostaining pattern A A A A was obtained with the MoAbs PG-B6 and PG-B6p and the polyclonal antibodies N-70-6 and N-3 , all of which appear to recognize different epitopes of the BCL-6 protein . ``
NLPHD markedly differs from other subtypes of HD . ``
* This view is based on a number of features suggesting that NLPHD may represent a neoplasm of germinal center origin : ( 1 ) the ultrastructural resemblance of L & H cells to centroblasts/large noncleaved cells `` ; ( 2 ) the mature B-cell phenotype of neoplastic L & H cells ( CD19* , CD20* , CD22 , J chaint , CD79a+ ) `` * `` `` ; ( 3 ) the occasional expression of CD30 in normal and neoplastic centroblasts `` ; ( 4 ) the close association of tumor cells with follicular dendritic cells and germinal center specific T-helper cells** `` * ; and ( 5 ) the demonstration by single-cell polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) of Ig rearrangements with ongoing somatic mutations of V-regions in neoplastic cells . ``
Although BCL-6 can not be regarded as a marker specific for germinal center B cells ( eg , a subset of T cells and squamous epithelial cells do express the molecule ) , `` its expression in NLPHD provides further support to the concept that this disease may represent a neoplasm of germinal center origin .
From the diagnostic point of view , labeling of paraffin sections with the PG-B6p MoAb highlights L & H cells and therefore may help their identification .
Because of its strong and consistent expression on most tumor elements of NLPHD , BCL-6 could well substitute EMA* as a marker for special studies , eg , picking-up of L & H cells for single cell PCR analysis in paraffin sections .
`` `` * ' Such a studies should allow in the future to analyze the structure of the BCL-6 gene ( eg , the presence of mutations ) * in isolated L & H cells .
A small percentage of Hodgkin and RS cells expressed BCL-6 in about 30 % classical HD cases with no apparent correlation with the phenotype of tumor cells ( null v B v T ) .
The biologic significance of this finding is presently under investigation .

470 The reactive lymphoid background of NLPHD also markedly differs from that of other types of HD . ``
In classical HD , the background of nonneoplastic lymphocytes is constituted by CD4* T cells , whereas the nodules of NLPHD are mainly made up of B cells displaying the phenotype of primary B follicles ( IgD*/IgM* ) admixed with a variable percentage of CD4* T cells , `` `` In this study , we provide the first immunohistologic evidence that the BCL-6*/CD40L~ phenotype is a feature of CD4* T cells in tissues involved by NLPHD , as opposed to CD4* T cells in other HD subtypes that consistently express CD40L `` ' but lack BCL-6 .
In all NLPHD cases studied , the percentage of BCL-6¢/CD4* T cells largely outnumbered that of CD57 ( Leu7 ) * cells , which is commonly regarded as a distinguishing immunophenotypic feature of NLPHD .
`` ** `` These immunohistologic findings raise questions regarding the biologic significance of BCL-6°/CD4* T cells in NLPHD .
We recently found that , in normal lymphoid tissues , in addition to germinal center B cells , BCL-6 is also expressed by a small subset of CD4* T lymphocytes that are present in higher percentage in germinal centers than in the interfollicular areas ( 5 % to 10 % v 0.5 % , respectively ) . ``
Whether these cells may play a role in T-cell-mediated germinal center-related functions `` will require further studies on isolated germinal center cells .
Notably , BCL-6¢/CD4* reactive T cells were only found within the tumor nodules of NLPHD , eg , nearby to or intimately associated with neoplastic cells , whereas the residual internodular T areas were often occupied by CD3 ¢/CD4*/BCLG6_ T lymphocytes .
This topographic distribution suggests that BCL-6 expression by T cells in NLPHD is strictly dependent on closeness to neoplastic B cells ( so-called L & H cells ) , possibly reflecting in situ release of cytokines by tumor cells or cell-contact-de-pendent interactions that could induce expression of BCL-6 or viceversa .
However , the results of our immunohistologic studies and the flow cytometry finding that BCL-6 and CD4O0L are differently regulated during the in vitro activation of normal CD4* T cells lend no support for the existence of a link between the expression of BCL-6 and that of CD4OL that is thought to be involved in the rosetting phenomenon in HD tissues . ``
'' ' In conclusion , labeling for BCL-6 provides another marker for characterizing L & H cells and the lymphoid mi-croenvironment of NLPHD .
The immunohistologic finding of strongly BCL-6* L & H cells surrounded and/or ringed by BCL-6+/CD4* T cells against a background of BCL-6~-/ IgM*/IgD* B lymphocytes in the tumor nodules of NLPHD is so typical it that immediately allows recognition of this pathologic entity .
Whether these immunohistologic features may be of value for differentiating NLPHD from cases of T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma should be the goal of future studies .
Better understanding of the biological function ( s ) of the BCL-6 protein may be expected to shed further light on the pathogenesis of NLPHD .
