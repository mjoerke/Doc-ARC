* Laboratory of Medical Chemistry/Medical Oncology , `` Laboratory of Fundamental Virology , `` and Laboratory of Pathology , `` University of Liege , Liege , Belgium Received 16 July 1998/Returned for modification 26 August 1998/Accepted 30 November 1998 We previously reported that the role of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) in NF-KB activation by proinflammatory cytokines was cell specific .
However , the sources for ROIs in various cell types are yet to be determined and might include S-lipoxygenase ( 5-LOX ) and NADPH oxidase .
5-LOX and 5-LOX activating protein ( FLAP ) are coexpressed in lymphoid cells but not in monocytic or epithelial cells .
Stimulation of lymphoid cells with led to ROI production and NF-KB activation , which could both be blocked by antioxidants or FLAP inhibitors , confirming that 5-LOX was the source of ROIs and was required for NF-B activation in these cells .
IL-1B stimulation of epithelial cells did not generate any ROIs and NF-KB induction was not influenced by 5-LOX inhibitors .
However , reintroduction of a functional 5-LOX system in these cells allowed ROI production and 5-LOX-dependent NF-KB activation .
In monocytic cells , IL-1f treatment led to a production of ROIs which is independent of the 5-LOX enzyme but requires the NADPH oxidase activity .
This pathway involves the Racl and Cdcd42 GTPases , two enzymes which are not required for NF-KB activation by IL-1 in epithelial cells .
In conclusion , three different cell-specific pathways lead to NF-KB activation by a pathway dependent on ROI production by 5-LOX in lymphoid cells , an ROI- and 5-LOX-independent pathway in epithelial cells , and a pathway requiring ROI production by NADPH oxidase in monocytic cells .
The interaction of interleukin-16 ( IL-1B ) with its type 1 cell surface receptor initiates a cascade of intracellular reactions leading to the activation of transcription factors and the expression of target genes .
One of the major transcription factors mediating IL-1B biological activities is NF-KB ( for reviews , see references 2 , 3 , and 22 ) .
This factor is sequestered in the cytoplasm by an inhibitor from the IxB family .
IL-16 cellular stimulation leads to a rapid phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa , the most common NF- « B inhibitor .
This reaction allows NF- « B to translocate to the nucleus , to bind DNA , and to activate the transcription of specific genes ( 2 , 55 ) .
Following its interaction with IL-1 , the type 1 IL-1 receptor recruits the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase ( IRAK ) protein , which subsequently interacts with the TRAF6 adapter protein ( 15 , 16 , 30 , 61 , 62 , 65 ) .
TRAF6 is required for IL-1B-induced NF- « B activation , as demonstrated in 293 cells ( 16 ) .
However , the signaling pathways leading to NF-kB activation from the IL-1B receptors are still controversial .
It has been demonstrated that TRAF6 interacts with a MAP kinase kinase kinase ( MAPKKK ) known as NIK and that NIK is required for IL-1B- or tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF- « ) -dependent NF- « B activation ( 39 , 56 ) .
Large ( 500 to 900 kDa ) multimeric protein kinase complexes have been purified from HeLa cells and transmit the signal from the TNF receptor type 1 ( TNFR-1 ) and type 1 IL-1 receptors to the cytoplasmic complex ( 17 , 20 , 33 , 41 ) .
From these complexes three IxB kinases , IKK- « @ , IKK-B , and IKK-y , have been purified , and their genes were cloned ( 20 , 42 , 49 , 66 ) .

1950 tors have cloned IKK kinases by virtue of their association with the NIK protein kinase ( 47 , 64 ) .
Moreover , inactivation of these kinases by dominant negative mutants suppresses IL-1B and TNF- « induction of NF- « B .
These studies indicate that the activated NIK kinase phosphorylates and activates the IKK protein kinases .
IKK protein kinases can in turn phosphorylate the IxBa protein on serines located at positions 32 and 36 , a reaction which targets IxBa for ubiquitination and rapid degradation by the proteasome ( 12 , 58 , 59 ) .
These reactions are extremely rapid , and the cellular IxBa protein is completely degraded within minutes following TNF- « or IL-18 cell stimulation ( 4 , 13 ) .
Despite this simplified linear receptor-TRAF-NIK-IKK axis for IxBa phosphorylation and degradation , other intermediates might be involved in NF-KB activation by TNF-a or IL-1 .
First , several components of the large signaling complex remain to be identified , as the three IKK protein kinases do not account for the molecular weight of the whole complex .
Sec-ond , a large number of studies , some of them being a matter of controversy , have identified other intermediates which seem to be required for TNF- « - or IL-1B-mediated NF- « B activation .
These intermediates are Raf-1 , MAP kinases , the PKC { and A/v isoforms , Rho and Rac proteins , and ceramide or reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) ( 19 , 24 , 25 , 32 , 33 , 38 , 46 , 50-53 , 57 ) .
Such a large number of controversial studies might be explained by cell type specificities .
Indeed , most of these studies were performed with a single cell line , although as we reported the roles of sphingomyelinases , PKC A/ , and ROIs in NF- « B activation by IL-1B were cell specific ( 6-8 ) .
We reported that an oxidative stress favored replication of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) containing a tandem KB site in its long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( 35 ) .
Later on , the authors of several studies proposed that ROIs were Vor .
19 , 1999 produced by all agents and were required for NF-kB activation ( 50-52 ) .
So far , however , the IB kinases activated by ROIs have not yet been identified .
More recently , however , it was reported that the effects of oxidants and antioxidants on NF- « B activation were dependent on the cell line and on the applied stimulus ( 10 , 11 ) .
We also reported that IL-18 induced NF-kB through the production of ROIs in lymphoid cells but independently of any ROI production in epithelial cells ( 6 ) .
These data indicate that the role of ROIs in activation is probably cell specific .
The sources of ROIs following TNF- « or IL-1B treatment are still largely unknown .
CD28 stimulation of T lymphocytes induces ROI production through an increase of the activity of 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LOX ) ( 37 ) , an enzyme which is also required for NF- « xB-dependent transcription induced by IL-18 in endothelial cells ( 34 ) .
The 5-LOX enzyme catalyzes the production of leukotrienes and ROIs from arachidonic acid ( 29 , 36 ) .
Its activity requires FLAP ( 5-LOX activating protein ) , which transports 5-LOX to the nuclear membrane ( 23 , 43 , 48 , 63 ) .
Recently , we reported that the inhibition of 5-LOX in lymphoid cells blocked NF- « B activation after IL-1B or arachidonic acid stimulation ( 7 ) .
Similarly , according to our previous data , the absence of ROI induction in IL-1B-treated epithelial cells might be due to low 5-LOX and high catalase activities ( 7 ) .
However , there are other sources of cellular ROIs , including the NADPH oxidase which is expressed not only in mono-cytes/macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils but also in lymphocytes ( 54 ) .
In the present study , we investigated the roles of 5-LOX , FLAP , and NADPH oxidase in the IL-1B-induced ROI production and NF-B activation in different cell types .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and biological reagents .
The cell lines HL-60 , U937 , Jurkat , EL-4 , Raji , OVCAR-3 , SKOV-3 , MCF7 A/Z , HCT-116 , HT-29 , and HTM-29 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 1 % antibiotics , 1 % glutamine , and 10 % fetal bovine serum .
The mouse pre-B-cell line 70Z/3 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % antibiotics , 1 % glutamine , and 10 mM B-mercaptocthanol .
Before stimulation , 70Z , /3 cells were grown for one day in medium without B-mercaptocthanol .
The breast cancer cell line MCF7 A/Z was a generous gift from M. Mareel ( University of Ghent , Belgium ) .
IL-16 treatment was carried out at a 50-U/ml concentration ( specific activity , > 5 X 10 `` U/mg ; Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) .
N-Acetyl-cysteine ( NAC ) or pyrrolidine-9-dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) was added to the medium 150 min before IL-1 $ stimulation .
Cells were incubated with the FLAP inhibitor MK-886 , a generous gift from J. Evans ( Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research , Quebec , Canada ) ( 40 ) , for 10 min before IL-1B stimulation , with phenylarsine oxide ( PAQ ; Sigma ) for 1 h prior to IL-1B treatment , or with diphenylenciodo-nium chloride ( DPI ; Sigma ) or eicosatetraynoic acid ( ETYA ; Sigma ) for 40 min before IL-1 $ stimulation .
Immunoblots .
Protein extracts ( 30 mg ) obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) lysis were separated on a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) gel .
After transfer to a nylon membrane ( Immobilon-P ; Millipore , Bedford , Mass . )
and overnight blocking at 4°C with Tris-buffered saline-Tween ( 20 mM Tris [ pH 7.5 ] , 500 mM NaCl , 0.2 % Tween 20 plus 5 % dry milk ) , the membranes were incubated for 1 h with specific antibodies directed against human 5-LOX and FLAP ( Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research ) , washed , and then incubated with the second peroxidase-conjugated antibody .
The reaction was revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method ( ECL kit ; Amersham , Little Chalfont , Buckinghamshire , United King-dom ) .
Fluorescence measurement of intracellular ROIs .
Formation of ROIs was measured using dichlorofluorescein diacetate ( DFCH ) ( 6 ) .
The cells were incubated in 175-cm* flasks with 20 wM DCFH in phenol red-free medium 199 .
After 15 min , the medium was removed and the cells were washed and incubated with IL-18 or H , O , for 15 min .
Fluorescence was measured by spectrofluorometry with excitation at 505 nm and detection of light emission at 525 nm .
ROI concentrations in cytoplasmic extracts were measured as previously described ( 6 ) and expressed as a function of the protein content in nuclear extracts from the same cells .
The measurements were performed on 3 X 10° cells for all cell types with the exception of selected CD20-positive cells , for which measurements were made on 1.2 x 10° cells .

5-LOX and FLAP expression in cell lines .
Protein extracts from various cell lines were prepared and analyzed for 5-LOX ( A ) and FLAP ( B ) expression by immunoblots revealed with specific antibodies .
The 5-LOX antibody was directed against the human protein and could not detect the murine enzyme in EL-4 and 70Z/3 cells .
The FLAP antibody could recognize both the human and the murine proteins , and the murine protein gave a faint and more slowly migrating band in EL-4 and 70Z/3 cells , which is visible after longer exposures of the gel .
Nuclear protein extraction and EMSA .
Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described ( 7 ) .
Briefly , the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in nuclear buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.63 M NaCl , 25 % glycerol , protease inhibitors [ protease inhibitor kit ; Bochringer ] ) , incubated for 20 min at 4°C , and centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge .
Protein amounts were quantified with the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit ( Pierce , Rockford , III . )
.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) were performed as described ( 26 ) .
The palindromic ( PD ) - « B probe was 5'-TTGGCAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCCITTA-3 ' .
Plasmids .
The reporter plasmid HIV- « kB-CAT contained the two xB sites from the HIV LTR cloned upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene ( 9 ) .
Expression vectors for wild-type and mutant RhoA , Racl , and Cdc42 were generous gifts from L. Cross ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Md . )
( 18 , 46 ) .
The 5-LOX and FLAP expression vectors were received from J. Evans ( Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research ) .
The pCMV-CD20 ( cluster of differentiation 20 antigen ) plasmid was kindly provided by Jim Koh ( Laboratory of Molecular Oncology , Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Cambridge , Mass . )
.
Transfections .
Expression vectors ( 1 pg ) and the HIV- « B-CAT reporter plasmid ( 4 pg ) were transfected into HCT-116 and MCF7 A/Z cells by using the DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
After 6 h , the DNA-containing medium was removed and replaced by fresh medium .
Cells were then left untreated or were stimulated with 50 U of IL-18/ml for 6 h. Cellular extracts were prepared and CAT activity was determined as described previously ( 9 ) .
U937 and THP-1 cells were transfected with DEAE-dextran ( Amersham } .
Cells ( 8 X 10° cells ) were incubated for 90 min at 37°C in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline ( pH 7.6 ) containing 5 pg of total DNA and 400 ug of DEAE-dextran .
After 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide was added for 2 min , 15 ml of Tris-buffered saline was added .
Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium for 24 b .
The IL-1 $ stimulation was then performed after the addition of 2 ml of fresh medium .
For stable transfections , MCF7 A/Z cells were transfected with the linearized peDNA3 ( 10 pg ) empty vector or with the 5-LOX expression vector ( 10 pg ) ( MCF7 A/Z LOX ) by using the DOTAP system ( Bochringer Mannheim ) .
Forty-eight hours later , transfected cells were selected in a medium containing G418 at 0.5 mg/ml .
After 15 days of selection , 10 G418-resistant colonies were isolated , grown separately , and selected for 5-LOX expression by immunoblotting .
Positive selection of CD20-positive cells .
Cells transfected with the CD20 expression vectors were washed , incubated in the presence of a fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ( Sanver Tech , Boechout , Belgium ) for 30 min , washed again , and then incubated with magnetic beads coated with a monoclonal anti-FITC antibody ( Miltenyi Biotec , Germany ) .
The beads were loaded on columns in a magnetic field , and positive cells were finally eluted in culture medium .

Using an antibody directed against the human 5-LOX , the protein was detected in Raji , SKOV-3 , HCT-116 , HT-29 ( faint band ) , and HTM-29 cells but not in the murine cell lines .
Moreover , we could not detect any 5-LOX expression in the THP-1 monocytic cells ( data not shown ) .

mRNA expression was also detected by reverse transcription ( RT ) -PCR in the murine lymphoid cell lines 70Z % /3 and EL-4 ( reference 7 and data not shown ) .
In other words , we could not observe any 5-LOX expression , either by immunoblotting or by RT-PCR , in monocytic cells or in breast or ovarian carcinoma cells .
Similarly , the FLAP protein was detected by Western blotting in the four analyzed lymphoid cell lines ( Fig .
1 ) .
Its expression was high in Raji cells and considerably lower in Jurkat cells .
A faint and more slowly migrating specific band was also detected with the human antibody in the murine cell lines EL-4 and 70Z/3 .
The expression of FLAP was not observed in any of the adenocarcinoma cell lines .
Among monocytic cell lines , FLAP was expressed in U937 and THP-1 cells but not in HL-60 cells ( Fig .
1 and data not shown ) .
We could thus conclude that only the lymphoid cells expressed simultaneously 5-LOX and FLAP proteins and could therefore demonstrate 5-LOX enzymatic activity .
ROI production following stimulation .
We previously reported that IL-18B stimulation led to the generation of ROIs in lymphoid cells but not in epithelial transformed cells ( 6 ) .
In order to determine whether ROI production was due to 5-LOX activity , U937 , Raji , MCF7 A/Z , and HCT-116 cells were stimulated with IL-1§6 ( 50 U/ml ! )
for 15 min and analyzed with a DFCH probe for ROI detection ( Fig .
2 ) .
Under these conditions , IL-1B treatment of Raji cells led to the production of ROIs ( Fig .
2A ; compare columns 2 and 3 ) .
As expected , preincubation of Raji cells with the antioxidant NAC or PDTC abolished ROI accumulation ( columns 4 to 7 ) .
Interestingly , preincubation of Raji cells prior to IL-1B stimulation with MK886 , a specific inhibitor of FLAP ( 40 ) ( columns 8 and 9 ) , or with the 5-LOX inhibitor ETYA ( columns 12 and 13 ) completely abolished or markedly decreased ROI production , confirming that 5-LOX activity was required for IL-1B-induced intracellular oxidative stress in lymphoid cells .
As a positive control , we measured ROI production in H , O , -treated cells ( 250 M ) ( columns 10 and 14 ) ; MK886 did not influence the ROI production after H , O , treatment , indicating that this inhibitor exerts a specific action ( data not shown ) .
Stimulation of U937 or THP-1 monocytic cells with IL-18B also generated ROIs ( Fig .
2B and C ; compare columns 2 and 3 ) .
Again , the production of ROIs was completely or partially abolished by preincubation of these cells with the antioxidant NAC or PDTC ( columns 4 to 7 ) .
Similar data were obtained with HL60 cells ( data not shown ) .
However , contrasting with the observation made with Raji cells , MK886 and ETYA failed to block ROI induction in monocytic cells ( columns 8 , 9 , 12 , and 13 ) , demonstrating that 5-LOX activity was not responsible for this production .
Stimulation of HCT116 or MCF7 A/Z cells with IL-18 did not generate any significant ROI production ( Fig .
2D and E , ; compare columns 2 , without IL-18 , and columns 3 , in the presence of IL-1B ) .
The last observation confirmed our previously reported data obtained with ovarian carcinoma OVCAR-3 cells ( 6 ) , indicating that IL-1B did not generate any oxidative stress in epithelial transformed cells .
Induction of NF-B following IL-1B stimulation .
Several reports stated that NF-kB induction following a number of stimuli depended on ROI production ( 50-52 ) .
However , we reported that IL-1B induced NF-kB in adenocarcinoma cells independently of any cellular oxidative stress ( 6 ) , an observation confirmed by the experiments described in Fig .
2 .
We therefore further evaluated the role of 5-LOX activity in NF-kB activation after IL-1B stimulation of lymphoid or monocytic cells .

onstrated by EMSA ( Fig .
3A , B , and C ) .
Pretreatment with antioxidant NAC or PDTC completely abolished NF- « B activation in the three cell lines .
However , pretreatment with the FLAP inhibitor MK-886 or the 5-LOX inhibitor ETYA inhibited IL-1B-dependent NF-KB activation in Raji cells ( Fig .
3A ) while it did not affect this induction in U937 or THP-1 cells ( Fig .
3B and C ) .
Similarly , antioxidants , MK-866 , or ETYA failed to abolish NF- « B activation by IL-18 in MCF7 A/Z and HCT-116 cells ( Fig .
3D and E ) , confirming our previous observation in OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 epithelial cells ( 6 , 7 ) .
These data thus indicate that 5-LOX activity plays an important role in ROI production and NF- « B activation in lymphoid cells but not in monocytic or epithelial cells .
Reconstitution of the 5-LOX/FLAP pathway in adenocarcinoma cells .
In order to confirm the data obtained with EMSAs , MCF7 A/Z cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid containing a CAT gene driven by the two kB sites from the HIV LTR ( HIV- « kB-CAT ) and then stimulated with IL-186 .
Such a treatment induced CAT activity three- to fourfold over the basal activity observed in untreated control cells ( Fig .
4A ) .
Cotransfection of the FLAP expression vector did not allow any further induction of CAT activity following stimulation ( columns 3 and 4 ) .
Moreover , the 5-LOX inhibitors MK-886 and ETYA failed to block IL-18 induction of NF-kB-dependent transcription in either FLAP -expressing ( Fig .
4A , columns 5 , 6 , 8 , and 9 ) or nonexpressing cells ( data not shown ) .
The same experiment was then performed in MCF7 A/Z cells stably transfected with a 5-LOX expression vector ( MCF7 A/Z-LOX ) .
In these cells , IL-1B induced NF-kB transcriptional activity and this activity was not modified in the presence of MK886 ( Fig .
4B and data not shown ) .
Transient transfection of MCF7 A/Z-LOX cells with the FLAP expression vector led to a small increase of the IL-1B-induced CAT activity ( Fig .
4B , column 4 ) .
In the presence of FLAP , treatment of MCF7 A/Z-LOX cells with MK-886 or ETYA completely abolished IL-1B-dependent transcriptional activity ( columns 5 , 6 , 8 , and 9 ) .
Consistently with these CAT assays , transient transfections of MCF7 A/Z cells with the FLAP expression vector did not allow any generation of ROIs , even after IL-1B stimulation ( Fig .
4C ; compare columns 2 and 3 ) .
However , transient transfection of the FLAP expression vector in MCF7 A/Z-LOX cells led to a marked increase in ROI production after IL-18 treatment ( Fig .
4D ; compare columns 4 and 5 ) while stable expression of 5-LOX alone was not sufficient for such an effect ( columns 2 and 3 ) .

NADPH oxidase inhibitors blocked NF- « B activation by IL-1B in monocytic cells .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from Raji ( A ) , U937 ( B ) , THP-1 ( C ) , HCT116 ( D ) , or MCF7 A/Z ( E ) cells , either untreated or stimulated with IL-18 ( 50 U/ml ) .
The same cells were preincubated for 1 h prior to IL-18B stimulation with increasing concentrations of DPI or PAO , as indicated in the figure .
These extracts were analyzed by EMSA for binding to a specific kB probe .
ETYA reduced ROI production in MCF7 A/Z cells transfected stably with the 5-LOX expression vector and transiently with the FLAP expression vector ( columns 6 to 11 , 14 , and 15 ) .
In HCT-116 cells , which express the 5-LOX enzyme but not the FLAP protein , IL-1 stimulated threefold the NF-kB-de-pendent CAT activity ( Fig .
5A ) and this stimulation was not blocked by MK886 ( data not shown ) .
Again , after cotransfection of the FLAP expression vector , we observed a small increase in the transcription induced by IL-1B ( column 4 ) , an effect which was inhibited by preincubation of the cells with MK886 ( columns 5 and 6 ) or ETYA ( columns 8 and 9 ) .
Similarly , transient transfection of the FLAP expression vector in HCT-116 cells was sufficient to allow the production of ROIs after IL-1B stimulation ( Fig .
5B ) , a production which was inhibited by preincubation with NAC , PDTC , MK886 , or ETYA .
We can thus conclude that coexpression of 5-LOX and FLAP is required to restore the 5-LOX-dependent pathway leading to production of ROIs and consequent NF-xB activation .
NADPH oxidase is required for ROI production in IL-1-treated monocytic cells .
Monocytic cells such as U937 or THP-1 cells produce ROIs in response to IL-1B stimulation but do not express 5-LOX .
They must therefore rely on another source for ROI production , and this source was deemed most likely to be NADPH oxidase .
We first investigated whether NADPH oxidase inhibitors could block ROI production in IL-1B-stimulated monocytic cells .
As already shown in Fig .
2 , IL-1B treatment induced ROIs in THP-1 and U937 cells ( Fig .
6A and B ; compare columns 2 and 3 ) .
Preincubation of these cells with DPI or PAO inhibited in a dose-dependent manner IL-1B-induced ROI production ( Fig .
6A and B , columns 4 , 5 , 8 , and 9 ) .
Interestingly , preincubation of Raji cells with the same NADPH oxidase inhibitors did not block ROI production ( Fig .
6C ) .

NF-kB activation by IL-18B , nuclear extracts were prepared from cells preincubated with the same inhibitor , DPI or PAO , prior to IL-1B stimulation .
These inhibitors did not modify NF-kB activation induced by IL-18 in Raji , MCF7 A/Z , or HCT-116 cells , as demonstrated on EMSAs ( Fig .
7A , D , and E ) .
However , they abolished in a dose-dependent manner the induction of NF-kB in U937 and THP-1 monocytic cells ( Fig .
7B and C ) , indicating that NADPH oxidase activity was required for the IL-1B-dependent signaling pathway leading to IxBa degradation in these cells .
Rac and Cdc42 are required for ROI production and NF-KB activation in IL-1f-treated monocytic cells .
Rho , Racl , and Cdc42 , all members of the Ras superfamily of GTPases , have been noted to play a role in several transduction processes , including the JNK/SAPK and MAPK pathways ( 60 ) .
More recently , it has been reported that Rho , Racl , and Cdc42 are involved in NF-kB induction by TNF- « or bradykinin ( 45 , 46 ) .
The NADPH oxidase component p67° `` `` * associates with Cdc42/Rac , and Racl is required for the activation of NADPH oxidase ( 1 , 5 , 21 ) .
Therefore , we investigated whether these GTPases are involved in IL-1B-induced NF- « B activation in adenocarcinoma or monocytic cells .
MCF7 A/Z cells were cotransfected with the HIV- « B-CAT reporter plasmid together with expression vectors coding for wild-type or dominant-negative RhoA , Racl , or Cdc42 ( Fig .
8A ) .
Again , IL-1B stimulation induced three- to four-fold the basal CAT activity .
This transcriptional activation was not modified in the presence of wild-type or mutant Rho , Rac1 , or Cdc42 proteins .
Similarly , treatment of MCF7 A/Z cells with TNF-a « or arachidonic acid also activated NF- « B-dependent transcription of the CAT reporter gene .
Again , the expression of wild-type or mutant GTPases did not modify this induction ( data not shown ) .
We thus concluded that RhoA , Racl , and Cdc42 are not required for NF- « B activation by IL-1 , TNF-a , or arachidonic acid in MCF7 A/Z cells .
In monocytic cells ( THP and U937 ) , however , while transfection of expression vectors for wild-type RhoA , Racl , or Cdcd42 did not modify transcription of an NF- « kB-dependent reporter plasmid , the expression of the Racl1 and Cdc42 dominant-negative mutants almost completely inhibited IL-1B-induced NF- « B-dependent gene transcription ( Fig .
8B and C ) .
In order to demonstrate that Cdc42 and Racl dominant-negative mutants could block ROI production in monocytic cells , U937 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors coding for these mutants or the wild-type enzymes .
Since the transfection efficiency was very low and did not allow the detection of any difference in ROI production , these cells were then cotransfected with the mentioned plasmids together with an expression vector coding for the CD20 antigen .
Transfected cells were purified through two rounds of positive selection with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , first by MACS and then by flow cytometry .
Purified transfected cells ( 1.2 X 10° cells ) were then treated with IL-1 $ B , and ROI production was measured as described above .
Under these conditions , IL-16 stimulation generated ROIs ( Fig .
9 ) .
This production of ROIs was not modified by the expression of wild-type Cdc42 or Racl enzyme , while it was significantly reduced by the two dominant-negative mutants , confirming their implied roles in induced ROI production in monocytic cells .

discussion .
The recent discovery of IxBa kinases IKK-B , and IKK-y ) and their activation by the NIK kinase led to the hypothesis that TNF- « or IL-1B receptors are connected to IkxBa through TRAF adapter proteins , NIK and IKKs ( 20 , 33 , 39 , 42 , 56 , 66 ) .
However , such a model did not incorporate the results of previous studies indicating the role of other signaling intermediates such as ROIs , ceramide , or Rho proteins and left unidentified other members of the large signaling complex .
These discrepancies could be explained by cell type specificities .
Indeed , most of the studies reported so far investigated a single cell line , and the models derived from such experiments might not be confirmed in different settings .
We previously reported that ROIs and the PKC A/ .
isoform play a cell-specific role in NF-KB activation by IL-1B8 or TNF-a ( 6-8 ) .
In this study , we explored the sources of ROIs in different cell types and their roles in NF-KB activation by IL-1B .
At least three different pathways that lead to induction of nuclear NF-kB DNA-binding activity and transactivation of a reporter gene after cellular treatment with IL-18B can be identified ( Fig .
10 ) .
Lymphoid cells , such as Raji or 70Z/3 cells , express 5-LOX and its activating protein FLAP , and 5-LOX enzymatic activity is required for ROI production and NF-kB activation following stimulation by IL-18B .
In these cells , the ROIs are essential for IxBa degradation and NF-xB activation ( 6 ) but it is not known whether ROIs can directly or indirectly activate the IKK kinases or whether other IxBa kinases are involved .
Epithelial cells do not express the 5-LOX/FLAP enzymatic complex and do not produce ROIs in response to IL-1B or TNF- « .
Reconstitution of the 5-LOX/FLAP system in these cells showed that , despite high catalase activity ( 7 ) , this enzymatic activity was sufficient to restore ROI production and ROI-dependent NF- « B activation .
In other words , once the 5-LOX pathway is functional , it becomes predominant .
These data , as well as those obtained with monocytic and lymphoid cells , suggest that the ROIs might activate the signalsome .
In the absence of 5-LOX , as we had previously reported , an alternative pathway which involves the activation of acid sphingomyelinase and the production of ceramide could be essential 1958 BONIZZI ET AL .

GTPases are required for ROI production in response to IL-1§ in monocytic cells .
U937 cells were transfected with the CD20 expression vector and with plasmids coding for wild-type ( Cdc42 and Rac ) or dominant-negative ( Cde42 `` and Rac `` ) Racl and Cdc42 .
CD20-expressing transfected cells were positively selected with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody through MACS and flow cytometry cell sorting .
Selected cells were either untreated ( - ) or stimulated with IL-1B ( + ) for 15 min , and formation of ROIs was measured by using a DFCH probe .
Asterisks indicate that values are statistically different from the reference values ( A ) .
for NF- « B activation by IL-186 in epithelial cells ( 7 ) , but such an hypothesis remains to be confirmed by genetic studies .
Finally , monocytic cells ( THP-1 or U937 cells ) do not express the 5-LOX enzyme but produce ROIs in response to IL-18 or TNF- « .
In these cells , ROIs are generated by the NADPH oxidase and are required for NF- « B activation by proinflammatory cytokines .
Moreover , the induction of NF- « B by IL-18 , TNF-a , or arachidonic acid in monocytic cells also requires the activity of small GTPases .
We concluded that Rho and Rac proteins stimulated ROI production through NADPH NADPH oxidase pl £ 3 ?

Signaling pathways for NF- « B activation by IL-16B .
Following the interaction of IL-1 with the type 1 IL-1 receptor , the NIK-IKK pathway can be activated through the MyD88 , IRAK , and TRAF6 signaling proteins .
Alterna-tively , Racl and Cdc42 can activate the NADPH oxidase complex and induce NF- « B activity through the production of ROIs .
Other pathways involve , in lymphoid cells , the cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 , the 5-LOX , and FLAP complex and the production of ROIs or , in epithelial cells , the acid sphingomyelinase ( SMase ) and the production of ceramide .

oxidase activation in macrophages/monocytes .
As for lymphoid cells , we do not know how ROIs are connected to IxBa kinases .
These data thus disclosed two distinct , cell-specific sources of ROIs , which are each required for NF-kB activation by proinflammatory cytokines , and a third pathway leading to NF- « B activation independently of ROI production ( Fig .
10 ) .
Such cell specificity might be explained by the association of distinct proteins with the IL-1 receptor .
Indeed , IL-1R associates with TRAF6 , My D88 , IRAK , and IRAK-2 proteins , which are all required for NF- « B activation ( 14-16 , 31 , 44 , 61 ) .
Moreover , other proteins might also associate with this receptor .
It is possible that the expression of each of these receptor-associated adapter proteins or kinases is cell specific and therefore initiates distinct transduction pathways .
Indeed , it has been shown that , although TRAF6 , MyD88 , IRAK , and IRAK-2 mRNAs could be detected in most cell types and organs , their levels of expression vary considerably ( 15 , 16 , 28 , 44 ) .
It would be most interesting to determine whether different proteins are associated with the IL-1 type I receptor in lymphoid , monocytic , or epithelial cells and play specific , cell type-related , signaling roles .
These signaling pathways leading to NF- « B activation might be related to distinct IL-1 biological activities in different cell types .
The nature of the activated NF- « xB complexes might be different for each pathway and lead to the transcription of distinct target genes .
Each pathway is also controlled differ-ently .
For instance , antioxidant cellular defenses could regulate pathways involving ROI production while distinct phosphatases could dephosphorylate kinase substrates and specifically regulate signal transduction .
Finally , the activation of distinct pathways leads to the concomitant activation of NF-kB and other specific transcription factors .
In a given cellular context , the activation of a specific set of transcription factors , including NF-kB , certainly regulates the expression of distinct target genes and thus allows an appropriate cellular response to the applied stimulus .
Further experiments are required in order to identify NF- « B target genes specifically induced by IL-1B in lymphoid , monocytic , or epithelial cells and to determine cell-specific mechanisms of regulation for each of them .
It has been shown that IL-1B can exert pro- or anti-apoptotic activities in HeLa and L929 cells ( 27 ) .
Moreover , high IL-1B levels have been measured in the sera of patients with ovarian adenocarcinomas ( 67 ) .
It is therefore crucial to better understand the role of IL-18 in normal and transformed epithelial cells and to identify the biochemical pathways mediating its biological activities .
