12 Initiation Binding Receptor , a Factor That Binds to the Transcription Initiation Site of the Histone A5 Gene , Is a Glycosylated Member of a Family of Cell Growth Regulators ALICIA GOMEZ-CUADRADO , MERCE MARTIN , MICHELINE NOEL , anp ADOLF RUIZ-CARRILLO®* Cancer Research Center and Department of Biochemistry , Medical School of Laval University , L'Hotel-Dieu de Québec , Québec , Québec GIR 216 , Canada Received 2 June 1995/Returned for modification 1 August 1995/Accepted 28 August 1995 Initiation binding receptor ( IBR ) is a chicken erythrocyte factor ( apparent molecular mass , 70 to 73 kDa ) that binds to the sequences spanning the transcription initiation site of the histone A5 gene , repressing its transcription .
A variety of other cells , including transformed erythroid precursors , do not have IBR but a factor referred to as IBF ( 68 to 70 kDa ) that recognizes the same IBR sites .
We have cloned the IBR cDNA and studied the relationship of IBR and IBF .
IBR is a 503-amino-acid-long acidic protein which is 99.0 % identical to the recently reported human NRF-1/a-Pal factor and highly related to the invertebrate transcription factors P3A2 and erected wing gene product ( EWG ) .
We present evidence that IBR and IBF are most likely identical proteins , differing in their degree of glycosylation .
We have analyzed several molecular aspects of IBR/F and shown that the factor associates as stable homodimers and that the dimer is the relevant DNA-binding species .
The evolutionarily conserved N-terminal half of IBR/F harbors the DNA-binding/dimerization domain ( outer limits , 127 to 283 ) , one or several casein kinase II sites ( 37 to 67 ) , and a bipartite nuclear localization signal ( 89 to 106 ) which appears to be necessary for nuclear targeting .
Binding site selection revealed that the alternating RCGCRYGCGY consensus constitutes high-affinity IBR/F binding sites and that the direct-repeat palindrome TGCGCATGCGCA is the optimal site .
A survey of genes potentially regulated by this family of factors primarily revealed genes involved in growth-related metabolism .
Histone HS is a specific linker histone of the erythroid lineage which is expressed during the maturation of embryonic and adult avian erythrocytes ( reference 2 and references there-in ) .
The chromatin levels of HS increase progressively following activation of the A5 gene , so that at the end of the maturation process , the stoichiometry of linker histones ( HS plus H1 ) per core histone octamer is more than 1 ( 5 ) .
The effects of ectopic expression of HS in nonerythroid cells , to levels comparable to those found in erythrocytes , argues for a direct role of HS in the condensation and inactivity of the erythrocyte nucleus ( 81 , 82 ) .
Although the gene is already set in an active chromatin conformation in early erythroid precursors ( 69 ) , its transcription is not activated until the preerythroblast-to-erythroblast transition ( 2 , 72 ) , coincident with the decline in the proliferation potential of the cells .
The mechanisms that bring about transcriptional activation of the A5 gene are not fully elucidated but appear to reflect alterations in the balance between positive and negative effectors .
Transcription of the £5 gene is regulated by a complex assortment of ubiquitous and blood cell-specific factors acting at the promoter and three differentiation-specific enhancers located upstream and downstream of the gene ( 72 , 73 ) .
Although the majority of these factors contribute to transcriptional activity , one of them , IBR , was found to repress A5 transcription in vitro ( 25 ) .
IBR from immature and mature adult erythrocyte nuclei is a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 70 to 73 kDa that specifically binds to the GC-rich sequences spanning the transcription initiation site of the £5 gene .
IBR repression of £5 transcription appears to occur by interference with the assembly of the transcription initiation complex ( 25 ) .

6670 IBR was not found in HD3 cells ( avian erythroblastosis virus [ AEV ] -transformed erythroid precursors ) , which instead contain a protein of 68 to 70 kDa that recognized the IBR sites of the A5 gene with a similar degree of specificity ( 25 ) .
Our previous work did not distinguish whether IBR was a matura-tion-specific form of IBF or a different protein expressed in maturing erythrocytes .
We report here the cloning of IBR cDNA and present evidence indicating that IBR and IBF are differentially glycosylated products of the same gene .
IBR/F is a member of a family of evolutionarily related transcription factors that includes sea urchin P3A2 ( 11 ) , the Drosophila erect wing gene product ( EWG ) ( 17 ) , and the recently reported human NRF-1/ « -Pal factor ( 18 , 88 ) .
The invertebrate members of this family have been implicated in the regulation of genes involved in the development of muscle and the central nervous system .
In vertebrates , they have been shown to activate transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial energy transduction ( 88 ) and protein synthesis ( 18 ) .
We argue that these factors play a role in the regulation of growth-related metabolism .
We also present a structural analysis of IBR/F and show that it associates as stable homodimers and that the dimer is the relevant DNA-binding species .
Our results also show that the N-terminal half of the protein , harboring the DNA-binding/ dimerization domain , the necessary nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) , and several potential casein kinase II ( CK-II ) sites , has been conserved during evolution , whereas the C-terminal half has diverged considerably .
A detailed study of the transcriptional effect of IBR and IBF on the 25 gene will be presented in a separate communication ( 242 ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Nuclear extracts and factor purification .
Nuclear extracts and IBR from 5 x 10 mature hen erythrocytes were prepared as described before ( 25 ) .
IBF was obtained from 1.5 x 104 HD3 cells essentially as described before ( 25 ) with the Vou .
15 , 1995 following modifications .
The nuclear extract in buffer A ( 25 mM HEPES [ N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-V'-2-ethanesulfonic acid , pH 7.9 ] , 20 % glycerol , 3 mM MgCl , , 10 uM ZnCl , 0.2 mM EGTA [ ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid ] , 6 mM 2-mercaptocthanol , 5 mM B-glycerophosphate , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [ PMSF ] , 1 M leupeptin , 1 wM pepstatin ) containing 0.3 M KCl was chromatographed through a 35-ml heparin-agarose column ( Pharmacia ) with a 0.3 to 0.6 M KCI gradient in buffer A .
The 0.4 to 0.5 M KCI fractions were pooled , dialyzed against 0.2 M KCl in buffer A , and loaded in a 5-ml wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) -Sepharose 4B column .
The flowthrough was loaded in a 10-ml double-stranded DNA-cellulose column ( Sigma ) and eluted with a 0.2 to 0.6 M KCI gradient in buffer A .
The 0.5 M KCI fraction containing IBF was further purified by two rounds of affinity chromatography with oligomerized cognate oligonucleotides bound to Sepharose .
For columns containing the histone A5 sequence , the sample was loaded in 0.2 M KCI , and IBF was eluted with 0.5 M KCI in buffer A .
For columns containing the palindrome ( PAL ) sequence AGCTTTGCGCATGCGCAA , the sample was loaded in 0.5 M KCI , and IBF was eluted with 1.2 M KCI in buffer A. IBF from HeLa cells was purified by chromatography of nuclear extracts through oligomerized PAL-Sepharose as described for the IBF of HD3 .
For glycosylation assays , the DNA affinity-purified proteins were fractionated by chromatography through succinylated WGA-Sepharose ( Vector Laborato-ries ) .
Proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-7.5 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-7.5 % PAGE ) and stained with silver ( 57 ) .
The protein concentration of purified IBR and IBF was estimated in stained gels or Western immunoblots by comparison to recombinant IBR ( r [ BR ) standards .
The protein concentration of extracts and rIBR was determined with the Micro BCA reagent ( Pierce ) .
IBR sequencing and peptide mapping .
Purified IBR ( 26 ug ) was precipitated with 10 volumes of acetone-acetic acid-triethylamine ( 90:5:5 ) .
The protein was cleaved with CNBr and trypsin , and several peptides separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) were sequenced ( W. M. Keck Foundation , Yale University ) .
The sequences obtained were : KRPHVFESNPSIR , VFGAAPLEN VVR , ESCKPIXWPXDIPXANVR , and VSWTQALR .
Purified IBR , IBF , and rIBR in 20 pl of 1 % SDS were reacted with 60 l of 1.3-mg/ml 2- ( 2'-nitrophenylsulfenyl ) -3-methyl-3'-bromoindolenine ( BNPS-ska-tole ; Pierce ) in acetic acid for 60 min at 47°C , conditions which are specific for cleavage at tryptophan residues ( 16 ) .
The resulting peptides were separated by SDS-14 % PAGE and visualized by Western blotting with anti-rIBR antibodies .
Construction of cDNA libraries and cloning of IBR cDNA .
Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from immature hen erythrocyte or HD3 polyadenylated [ poly ( A ) * ] RNA ( 67 ) .
A partial hen erythrocyte cDNA library was constructed with AZap II ( Stratagene ) , and double-stranded cDNA was fractionated by size by low-melting-point agarose electrophoresis ( 15 ) .
The nonamplified library was screened with a partial IBR cDNA clone obtained by PCR amplification of erythrocyte double-stranded cDNA with the sense primer GGAATTCC ( A/C/G ) CCNCACGTNTT ( C/T ) GA and the reverse primer GCTCTAGAGC ( C/A ) A ( G/A ) TGC ( T/C ) TG ( G/T/A ) GTCCA , corresponding to peptides PVHFE and WTQAL , respectively .
PCR conditions were as described before ( 15 ) .
Two IBR cDNA clones were isolated , pe [ BR1 and peIBR2 ( Fig .
2 ) , that contained incomplete open reading frames ( ORFs ) ( pc [ BR1 encompassing nucleotides 281 to 1691 , and peIBR2 encompassing 738 to 2029 ) .
The missing 5 ' sequences were obtained by ligation-mediated PCR ( LMPCR ) ( 59 ) with the reverse primers pri ( GCTCTTGTACTTGCGTACC ) , pr2 ( TACCACATTCTCCAAGGGTGCAG CTC ) , and pr3 ( GAAGACAGGGTTGGGTTTGGAGGGTGA ) and the forward linker primer ( GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC ) .
Double-stranded cDNA from immature hen erythrocyte or HD3 cells was denatured , annealed to pri , elongated with T7 DNA polymerase , and ligated to the common linker .
Elongated products were amplified with Tag polymerase , using 10 pmol each of pr2 and forward linker primer .
The PCR conditions were 1 min at 94°C , 2 min at 63°C , and 3 min at 76°C for 25 cycles in a Perkin Elmer/Cetus DNA thermal cycler .
One-hundredth of the reaction was reamplified with pr3 and the forward linker primer ( PCR conditions were as above except that the annealing temperature was 67°C ) .
The IBR cDNA- ( peIBR3 ) and IBF cDNA-specific products were purified by gel electrophoresis and cloned in pCR-1000 ( Invitro-gen ) .
A cDNA containing the complete ORF of IBR was reconstructed by swapping the appropriate 5 ' and 3 ' regions of pe [ BR1 and pe [ BR3 at a unique MiuI site of the overlapping sequences .
The reconstructed plasmid is hereafter referred to as pcIBR .
Dideoxy nucleotide sequencing of the two DNA strands was carried out with a T7 DNA polymerase kit ( Pharmacia ) .
Band ambiguities were resolved by substituting dGTP with 7-deaza-dGTP or by posttreatment of the elongated products with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( 42 ) .
Computer DNA and protein sequence analyses were performed with the Genetics Computer Group software .
Recombinant proteins .
IBR and several deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) ( 79 ) with the vector pET15b ( Novagen ) , as suggested by the manufacturer .
For the full-length recombinant protein , rIBR , the parental pe [ BR was modified to introduce a FLAG epitope ( 6 ) at the N terminus of IBR and a simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) T antigen epitope , recognized by monoclonal antibody kt3 ( 49 ) , at the C terminus of IBR .
This was achieved by PCR of 40 ng of peIBR with the forward ( CGGGATCCCGCCATGGACTACAAGG MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF IBR/F ( GRF-1 ) 6671 ACGATGAAGAACACGGCGTGAC ) and reverse ( CGGGATCCTCATGTT TCTGGTTCTGGTGGAGGTGTCTGTTCCAAAGTTACCAC ) primers .
The forward primer provided a BemHI site followed by a consensus translation initiation sequence ( 44 ) and coded for the additional peptide MDTKDD that was fused to the Glu at position 2 of the IBR reading frame .
The reverse primer deleted the natural termination codon of IBR mRNA and added the sequence TPPPEPET , followed by a termination codon and a BamHI site .
The amplification conditions were 1 min at 94°C , 1.5 min at 55°C , and 1 min at 72°C for 7 cycles , followed by 1 min at 94°C , 1.5 min at 65°C , and 1 min at 72°C for an additional 18 cycles .
The PCR product was digested with BamHI and cloned in pBluescript ( Stratagene ) .
This plasmid is referred to as peIBRFT .
DNA sequencing indicated that peIBRFT contained a T - > A transversion at position 333 , producing an F - > I mutation .
To regenerate the wild-type sequence , the fragment SphI-M/ul ( 155 to 369 ) of the PCR product was replaced by the same fragment of pelBR .
The cDNA insert of pcIBRFT was digested with BamHI and cloned at the BamHI site of pET15b .
To construct N-terminal deletion mutants of rIBR , the insert of pc [ BRFT was cleaved with Aval ( AN49 ) , M/ul ( AN110 ) , BsfXI ( AN127 ) , and Heell ( AN172 ) .
Mutant AN79 was constructed from peIBR1 .
The corresponding cDNA fragments were inserted in a pET15b vector appropriately modified to permit in-frame fusions of the different mutants to the tag of six His residues ( His , ) provided by the vector .
To construct C-terminal deletion mutants , the peIBRFT insert was digested with Earl ( AC424 ) , BsaHI ( AC333 ) , BanI ( AC300 ) , Sau3aI ( AC283 ) , and Fspl ( AC247 ) .
The corresponding cDNA fragments were inserted at the BamHI site of a modified pET15b vector that provided termination codons in the three reading frames , immediately downstream of the insertion site .
The recombinant proteins were extracted under nondenaturing conditions as recommended by the manufacturer .
rIBR and the C-terminal deletion mutants were purified by heparin-agarose chromatography because translation started at the AUG of cIBRFT rather than at the vector AUG , resulting in proteins that did not contain the His , tag .
N-terminal deletion mutants were purified by affinity chromatography on Ni** nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose ( Qiagen ) .
pRC/RSV ( Invitrogen ) was used to construct eukaryotic expression vectors of IBR .
DNAs coding for full-size rIBR or N-terminally and C-terminally truncated proteins were excised from the pET15b constructs and inserted at the HindIII site of pRC/RSV by blunt-end ligation .
All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing .
Determination of the optimal IBR recognition sequence .
Affinity-purified IBR ( 100 ng ) was incubated with 1 mg of the double-stranded oligonucleotide mixture CGTTGAATTCCGTAGG ( N ) , , CAGGCTGAATTCGCAC ( i.e .
, 30-fold molar excess of probe ) in 100 pl of binding buffer ( 100 mM KCI , 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 3 mM MgCl , , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 1 pg of bovine serum albumin per ml , 10 % glycerol ) .
After 3 h at 4°C , sonicated salmon sperm DNA was added to a final concentration of 10 pg/ml , and the mixture was loaded on a 100-pl WGA-Sepharose column equilibrated with binding buffer containing salmon sperm DNA .
The flowthrough fraction was discarded , and the column was successively washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer , 0.2 M KCI-containing binding buffer , and binding buffer .
Oligonucleotide-protein complexes were eluted with 0.3 M N-acetylglucosamine in binding buffer , and DNA was purified by phenol extraction .
One-fifteenth of the DNA was amplified by PCR in a reaction containing 20 mM Tris ( pH 8.3 ) , 50 mM KCI , 2.5 mM MgCl , , 0.01 % gelatin , 50 wM each of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates , 5 U of Tag DNA polymerase , and 200 pmol each of forward ( CGTTGAATTCCGTAGG ) and reverse ( GTGCGAATTCAGCCTG ) primers .
The PCR conditions were 92°C for 1 min , 43°C for 2 min , and 72°C for 0.5 min for 19 cycles .
Then 300 ng of amplified probe was incubated with 100 ng of cIBR as indicated above , and the procedure was repeated five or eight times .
Oligonucleotides selected by IBR were digested with EcoRI ( sites underlined in the original sequence ) and inserted at the EcoRI site of pUC12N23 , which contains an ( N ) ; , signature sequence at the Xbel site of pUC12 to permit identification of independent re-combinants .
Cross-linking .
Purified IBR or partially purified IBF ( 50 to 60 ng in a 25-pl reaction ) were incubated with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde ( 0 to 0.1 % ) in 25 mM HEPES ( pH 7.5 ) -0.1 M KCl-1 mM EDTA-5 mM MgCl , -8 % glycerol for 30 min at 30°C .
The reaction was quenched with Tris-HCI ( pH 7.5 ) to a final concentration of 50 mM .
Insulin ( 10 ag ) was added as the carrier , and proteins were precipitated and analyzed by Western blot with anti-rIBR antibodies .
DNA-binding assays and kinetic measurements .
DNase I footprinting and gel retardation assays were carried out as described before ( 25 , 72 ) .
Where indi-cated , the nuclear extracts were incubated with immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) from preimmune or immune anti-IBR serum for 2 h at room temperature prior to incubation with the labeled oligonucleotide probes .
The wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences from -20 to +14 and -10 to +14 of the A5 gene have been described ( 25 ) .
Additional oligonucleotides were PAL ( GTAGACTGCGCATGCGCATCT ) and 1/2 PAL ( GATGTAGACTGCGCAT CTGTATGC ) .
On-rate determinations were carried out at 0°C with a probe concentration of 6 x 10~° M and purified IBR at 1.2 x 10~° M. Aliquots were loaded at different times in a 4 % polyacrylamide gel running at 20 V/cm , and it took 3 min for the DNA complex to enter the gel .
For off-rate measurements , the reaction mixtures 6672 GOMEZ-CUADRADO ET AL .
were incubated to virtual equilibrium for up to 4 h at 0°C , at which time a 100-fold molar excess of nonlabeled probe was added .
Incubation was continued for 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 105 , and 135 min ( in the case of the A5 probe ) or for 0 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 360 , 480 , 570 , and 720 min ( in the case of the PAL probe ) before immediately loading the reaction mixtures in a gel .
To determine the dissociation constant of the IBR dimers , increasing concentrations of the protein ( 0.72 X 10~° to 7.2 x 10~° M ) were incubated in the binding buffer for 30 min at 30°C prior to addition of the *°P-labeled DNA probe ( 7.2 X 10~® M ) , and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min .
Gels were fixed for 90 min with 40 % methanol-10 % acetic acid and dried .
The radioactivity of bound and free probes was quantified with a PhosphorImager 445SI ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Cells and transfection .
Chicken erythroid HD3 cells AEV-transformed CFU ( E ) ] and H32 cells ( transformed quail fibroblasts ) were grown as previously described ( 72 , 73 ) .
HD3 cells were induced to differentiate at 41°C with 15 wM H7 ( Sigma ) .
H32 cells were transfected with 1 ug of the Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) -IBR expression vectors with Lipofectamine ( GIBCO-BRL ) as recommended by the manufacturer .
Cells were processed at 48 h posttransfection for indirect immunofluorescence assays .
Antibodies .
Antibodies against affinity DNA-purified chicken IBR were elicited in rabbits injected with a mixture of 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 20 pg of affinity-purified protein and 200 pg of insulin with 0.5 ml of Inject Alum ( Pierce ) .
Rabbits were boosted after 3 weeks with the same mixture , and IgG was purified from antisera by protein A-Sepharose chromatography .
Antibody reaction was not noticeably affected by periodate oxidation of cIBR , indicating that the antibodies were not specific for carbohydrate epitopes ( 92 ) .
Rabbit anti-rIBR antibodies were obtained by injection of untagged AN79-IBR and purified by affinity chromatography .
Monoclonal antibody kt3 , specific for the carboxyl terminus of SV40 T antigen ( 49 ) , was the generous gift of J. Landry .
Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were done as described before ( 15 ) with anti-r [ BR or kt3 as the primary antibody .
Texas red-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig or fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibodies were used as secondary reagents .
IBR phosphorylation .
Purified immature erythrocytes ( 64 ) from the peripheral blood of anemic hens were resuspended in 2 ml ( 10° cells per ml ) of phosphate-free Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( GIBCO-BRL ) supplemented with dialyzed 8 % fetal calf serum and 2 % chicken serum and labelled with 2.5 mCi of carrier-free *°P ; ( New England Nuclear [ NEN ] ) per ml for 17 h at 37°C and 5 % CO ; .
Cells were washed and lysed with 1 ml of buffer B ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.5 % Tween 20 , 0.10 M NaCl , 40 mM NaF , 1.5 mM B-naph-thylIphosphate , 10 mM B-glycerophosphate , 1 mM DTT , 0.4 mM PMSF , 1 mM benzamidine , 1 M leupeptin , and 1 M pepstatin ) .
After centrifugation , the crude nuclear pellet was suspended in 100 pl of buffer B supplemented with 0.5 % deoxycholate and 1 % SDS and boiled for 5 min .
The lysate was diluted with 900 pl of buffer B supplemented with 0.2 mM EDTA and 0.2 mM EGTA and centrifuged for 1 h at 40,000 rpm in an SW50.1 rotor .
The supernatant was precleared by incubation with 40 wl of neutral rabbit IgG cross-linked ( 78 ) to protein A-Sepharose for 18 h at 4°C and reacted with 10 pl of affinity-purified anti-rIBR IgG cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose for an additional 18 h at 4°C .
The beads were washed four times with 0.1 % SDS containing buffer B , resuspended in 1 volume of 2 % electrophoresis sample buffer , and boiled for 3 min before loading the gel .
Proteins separated by electrophoresis were transferred onto a 0.2-wm nitrocellulose membrane ( Schleicher and Schiill ) .
After *°P detection by autoradiography , the membrane was reacted with anti-rIBR antibodies .
For CK-II assays , 500 ng of rIBR or AN79-IBR in 10 pl of 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.4 ) -0.1 M NaCl-10 mM MgCl , -60 uM ATP-1 M leupeptin-1 M pepstatin , 0.4 mM PMSF containing 5 Ci of [ y- `` °P ] JATP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ; NEN ) was treated with 10 ng of CK-II ( Kinetek Biotechnology Corp. ) for 30 min at 30°C .
Reactions were terminated by addition of electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling for 2 min .
CK-II was omitted from control reactions .
For p424 `` * kinase ( ERK2 ) assays , CCL39 hamster fibroblasts were mock transfected or transfected with pEXV-ERK2-Tag , a vector expressing mouse ERK2 tagged with a c-Myc epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 9E10 ( 34 ) .
At 60 h posttransfection , cells were deprived of serum for 24 h and induced or not with 1 % fetal calf serum for 10 min .
Cell extracts were immediately prepared in buffer D ( 20 mM Tris [ pH 7.5 ] , 0.15 M NaCl , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl , , 1 mM sodium vanadate , 1 % Triton X-100 , 1 mM PMSF , and 1 M leupeptin ) and reacted with antibody 9E10 bound to protein A-Sepharose .
Then 2 mg of rIBR or myelin basic protein was mixed with aliquots of the immunoprecipitates in a 30-pl reaction for 25 min at 30°C .
The reaction cocktail contained 1.5 Ci of [ y- > °P ] JATP , 25 wM ATP , 15 mM MOPS ( mor-pholinepropanesulfonic acid , pH 7.0 ) , 5 % glycerol , 60 mM pere-nitrophenyl phosphate , 15 mM MgC ) ; , 1 mM DTT , 1 wM leupeptin , 0.1 mM PMSF , and 0.3 ug of cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) -dependent protein kinase inhibitor ( Sigma ) .
Reactions were quenched by addition of electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling for 2 min .
Blot analyses .
Western blot analyses were done as described before ( 74 ) except that chemiluminescence was used for detection ( ECL ; Amersham ) .
For Northern ( RNA blot ) analysis , total RNA from undifferentiated and differentiated HD3 cells and poly ( A ) * RNA from immature hen erythrocytes were sep- Mor .
CELL .
BioL .
arated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane ( Amersham ) .
For Southern analysis , restriction nuclease-digested erythrocyte DNA was separated by electrophoresis in 0.5 % agarose gels and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane .
Blotted nucleic acids were hybridized with the insert of pcIBR1 labeled by random priming with a DNA labeling kit ( Pharmacia ) .
The sizes of proteins , RNA , or DNA were estimated from those of appropriate standards run in parallel lanes .
RESULTS IBR and IBF are related proteins .
Gel retardation assays indicated that HeLa cells contain a nuclear protein which formed a specific complex with a probe containing the transcription initiation site of the histone A5 gene .
The electrophoretic mobility of the complex was identical to that formed by IBR from chicken erythrocytes and IBF from HD3 ( Fig .
1A , IBR/IBF ) .
An additional complex made by the HeLa nuclear extract ( Fig .
1A , band X ) was nonspecific , since its formation was prevented by competition with an oligonucleotide containing a mutated IBR/IBF binding site ( Fig .
1A ) .
Similar assays with nuclear proteins from chicken brain and T lymphoblas-toma cells ( MSB-1 ) , transformed H32 quail fibroblasts , mouse L cells , and rat liver ( not shown ) further indicated that all the systems studied contained a DNA-binding protein related to IBR or IBF .
Therefore , IBR or IBF appears to be ubiquitous .
To investigate the relationship among these specific DNA-binding proteins , the erythrocyte , HD3 , and HeLa extracts were incubated with purified rabbit anti-IBR IgG prior to incubation with the £5 probe .
Pretreatment with the antibodies reduced the amount of the specific complexes in a concentra-tion-dependent manner ( Fig .
1B ) .
At the lower antibody dos-age , a supershifted complex was clearly observed for each of the extracts ( Fig .
1B , SS ) , the amount of which was related to the concentration of the specific DNA-binding protein of the extract .
At higher antibody dosages , the complexes were probably immunoprecipitated and did not enter the gel .
On the other hand , preincubation of the extracts with preimmune IgG did not affect the mobility of the specific complexes ( Fig .
1B ) .
Figure 1C shows that the anti-IBR IgG also recognized the proteins from the three nuclear extracts after purification by affinity chromatography with the oligomerized A5 oligonucle-otide .
IBR from erythrocytes showed a slower electrophoretic mobility ( 70 to 73 kDa ) than IBF from HD3 ( 68 to 70 kDa ) ( Fig .
1C , lanes 1 and 2 ) , in accordance with our previous results ( 25 ) , whereas the HeLa protein had the same mobility as IBF , although the relative proportion of the 70-kDa species was higher ( Fig .
1C , lane 3 ) .
Although the heterogeneity of the proteins could reflect their posttranslational modifications ( see below ) , the 68-kDa component appears to be a proteolytic product of the 70-kDa species , since its relative proportion varied from preparation to preparation and increased with handling of the sample ( Fig .
1C , cf .
lanes 4 and 5 ) .
In conclusion , these results indicate that IBR is structurally related to IBF ( HD3 ) and that HeLa cells contain a protein which is probably the human homolog of IBF .
Cloning and analysis of IBR cDNA .
To characterize IBR and to determine its structural relationship with IBF , we undertook the cloning of IBR cDNA .
Purified IBR from mature erythrocytes was cleaved with CNBr and trypsin , and four peptides separated by HPLC were sequenced ( Fig .
2 ) .
A com-puter-assisted search of the GenBank and SwissProt databases revealed that P3A2 , a transcription factor isolated from sea urchin embryos ( 11 ) , contained almost identical sequences .
To obtain a probe for IBR cDNA cloning , double-stranded cDNA from immature erythrocytes was amplified by PCR with degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the outer PHVFE and WTQAL peptides of IBR according to the P3A2 Vou .

MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF IBR/F ( GRF-1 ) 6673 sequence .
The sequence of the amplified DNA product encompassed a reading frame coding for the two internal pep-tides , while the rest of the sequence confirmed the strong homology of IBR with P3AZ .
Moreover , the erythrocyte PCR product and a 456-bp PCR product of chicken liver cDNA amplified with different P3A2-specific primers ( kindly provided by F. Calzone ) had identical overlapping sequences .
This result further indicated that IBR is the chicken homolog of P3A2 .
Since the size of IBR mRNA was estimated to be 3.6 X 10° nucleotides ( see Fig .
5A ) , a partial cDNA library was constructed with size-fractionated double-stranded cDNA of > 1.5 kbp to enrich the IBR cDNA .
Screening of 6 X 10° recombinant phages of the nonamplified library with the PCR probe resulted in the isolation of two overlapping IBR cDNA clones , peIBR1 and pceIBR2 ( Fig .
2 ) , which contained incomplete ORFs ( i.e .
, without the initiator methionine ) and different lengths of 3 ' untranslated ( UTR ) sequences .
Because further screening of the library yielded no additional positive clones , the missing 5 ' sequences were obtained by LMPCR of erythrocyte cDNA with nested reverse primers located downstream of the unique MiuI site of peIBR1 .
The major amplified DNA product ( pcIBR3 [ Fig .
2 ] ) contained the expected pelBR1 overlapping fragment and additional 5° sequences that included a putative initiator ATG .
Although the sequences upstream of the AUG codon could code for additional N-terminal amino acids , we considered this unlikely because no PCR products longer than pcIBR3 were detected by hybridization with peIBR1 .
Therefore , a cDNA containing the complete ORF of IBR , referred to as pelBR , was constructed by swapping the 5 ' fragment of peIBR3 and the 3 ' fragment of pelBR1 at the unique M/uI site ( Fig .
2 ) .
Although peIBR2 ends with a stretch of poly ( A ) , this sequence is likely to represent not the true 3 ' end of the mRNA but the product of internal oligo ( dT ) priming at this tract , since erythrocyte IBR mRNA is 3.6 kb long ( see Fig .
5A ) .
Consistent with this interpretation , Southern blot analysis of the erythrocyte double-stranded cDNA indicated the presence of a major species ( > 95 % ) of about 2 kbp ( not shown ) .
Therefore , we concluded that approximately 1.6 kb of 3 ' UTR were missing from the cloned cDNA .
The sequence of peIBR predicts an acidic protein ( pK , = 4.8 ) of 503 amino acids ( 53.6 kDa ) with strong local homology to P3A2 ( see below ) .
The calculated mass of IBR is 27 % smaller than that estimated by SDS-PAGE .
This discrepancy is mainly due to an anomalous electrophoretic behavior of the protein , as already noted for P3A2 ( 11 ) and other related factors ( see below ) , since the recombinant protein ( rIBR ) made in £ .
coli had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of natural IBR ( see Fig .
8A ) .
Figure 2 also shows a schematic map of IBR based on its amino acid composition , the DNA-binding/dimerization domain , several putative CK-II sites , and the NLS ( see below ) .
The 36 N-terminal residues , relatively glutamine-rich ( 14 % ) , are followed by an acidic region ( pK , = 2.9 ) , comprising residues 37 to 67 , that contains several putative sites for CK-II , at least one of which is phosphorylated in vitro by the purified kinase ( see Fig .
8B ) .
This region is separated by an alanine-rich ( 48 % ) motif , encompassing residues 68 to 88 , from a basic segment , residues 89 to 127 ( pK , = 12.3 ) , which harbors a putative bipartite NLS ( see Fig .
13 ) .
The region from residues 127 to 285 is neutral and relatively proline-rich , whereas the rest of the molecule is acidic ( pK , = 3.6 ) and relatively glu-tamine-rich .
DNA-binding specificity of recombinant IBR .
To ascertain that IBR and rIBR recognized identical DNA sequences , their footprints on the A5 promoter were analyzed .

Nucleotide sequence of a partial IBR cDNA ( peIBR ; EMBL database accession number X86013 ) and deduced protein sequence of IBR .
peIBR was reconstructed from the cDNA clones pe [ BR1 to peIBR3 , as indicated .
Nucleotides present in pcIBR1 and not in peIBR2 are shown in lowercase letters .
Underscored amino acids correspond to the peptide sequences determined from purified IBR .
A schematic representation of IBR subregions is given below the sequence .
Q , glutamine-rich regions ( 12 to 14 % ) ; P , proline-rich region ( 9 % ) ; - , acidic regions ( pK , 2.9 to 3.6 ) ; + , a highly basic region ( pK , , 12.3 ) .
Vertical broken lines correspond to putative CK-II sites .
The solid box shows the bipartite nuclear localization signal , and the hatched box shows an alanine-rich region ( 48 % ) .
contains several IBR/IBF binding motifs , including a series of 6-bp overlapping sites ( Fig .
3B , boxes B to E ) , the -7 to +5 site ( box C ) having the highest affinity and strongest methylation interference ( 25 ) .
The DNase I assays ( Fig .
3A ) indicated that rIBR protected the same regions as IBR and IBF , including sequences upstream and downstream of the A5 transcription initiation site .
At the lower protein concentrations , the three proteins first protected sites B to E , followed by the half-site A .
At the higher rIBR concentration used , a protection of the lowest-affinity site F was also observed .
The additional footprint upstream of A , observed with the three proteins , corresponds to an FspI site of the pBR322 vector that has the sequence TGCGCA , corresponding to half of the IBR optimal recognition site ( see below ) .
These results , together with the ability of IBR and rIBR to form complexes with £5 probes that have the same electrophoretic mobility ( not shown ) , further indicated that pcIBR encodes bona fide IBR .
Homology of IBR to related nuclear factors .
During the course of this work , the sequences of two proteins highly related to IBR , Drosophila EWG ( 17 ) , and human NRF-1 ( 88 ) , became available .
EWG is involved in the development of the central nervous system and flight muscles .
Although the DNA-binding and transcriptional effects of EWG were not investi-gated , this protein is likely to be a transcription factor by analogy to the other proteins of this family .
NRF-1 is a transcriptional activator of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial energy transduction ( 88 ) and is identical to the recently reported human « -Pal factor ( 18 ) , which activates transcription of the gene ( eif-2 « ) coding for the a subunit of the translation initiation factor IF-2 .
In common with IBR and P3A2 , these proteins behaved in SDS-PAGE as having apparent molecular masses 30 to 50 % larger than those predicted from their respective cDNAs .
A comparison of the structurally related factors showed that IBR has the same size as and 99 % overall identity with NRF-1/ « -Pal ( Fig .
4 ) , clearly indicating that it is the chicken homolog of the human factor .
The five changes between the sequences of IBR and NRF-1/ « -Pal occur in the C-terminal half of the proteins at residues 289 ( Q-T ) , 291 ( T-A¥ ) , 293 ( T-A ) , 485 ( A-S ) , and 491 ( V-M ) .

Homology of IBR to related transcription factors .
The sequences compared with IBR are NRF-1/ « -Pal ( 18 , 88 ) , sea urchin P3A2 ( 11 ) , and Drosophila EWG ( 17 ) .
The percentage of amino acid identity between the evolutionarily conserved and nonconserved regions is indicated inside the boxes .
Patches of homology in the C-terminal halves are indicated by the open boxes .
Other symbols are as in Fig .
2. the vertebrate and invertebrate factors is only segmental , EWG having longer N- and C-terminal sequences , whereas P3A2 has a shorter N-terminal sequence .
However , residues 36 to 285 of IBR have been evolutionarily conserved with respect to residues 1 to 250 of P3A2 ( 67.5 % identity ) and residues 94 to 343 of EWG ( 59.7 % identity ) .
Interestingly , these regions encompass the DNA-binding and dimerization domains , as well as the NLS and some of the potential CK-II sites ( see below , Fig .
8 , 12 , and 13 ) .
On the other hand , the C-terminal halves have low general sequence conservation ( 26.8 % and 21.2 % identity for P3AZ and EWG , respectively ) , although they have patches of significant homology ( i.e .
, IBR 312 to 334 with P3A2 285 to 302 and EWG 552 to 562 , IBR 377 to 392 and P3A2 339 to 354 , IBR 454 to 464 with P3AZ 396 to 406 and EWG 639 to 649 [ Fig .

Peptide maps of IBR , IBF , and rIBR .
( A ) The purified proteins were partially cleaved at tryptophan residues with BNPS-skatole , and the products were analyzed by Western blot with anti-r [ BR antibodies .
( B ) Summary of the positions of tryptophan residues in IBR and the origin of the cleaved peptides .
IBR and IBF are the products of the same gene .
RNA from immature erythrocytes and undifferentiated or differentiated HD3 cells revealed the presence of a unique species of about 3.6 kb when hybridized to a peIBR1 probe ( Fig .
5A ) .
Amplification by LMPCR of double-stranded cDNA from immature erythrocyte and HD3 cells with specific IBR cDNA primers yielded fragments similar in length and identical in DNA sequence ( not shown ) .
These results , together with the other properties common to IBR and IBF , such as epitopes , DNA-binding specificity , footprints , and mobility of the DNA com-plexes , suggested that the two proteins are probably coded by the same gene .
Southern analysis of genomic chicken DNA hybridized with peIBR1 indicated that the ibr gene is unique ( Fig .
5B ) , and hybridization under less stringent conditions failed to detect other genomic DNA fragments having about 80 % identity to the probe ( not shown ) .
These results further supported the view that IBR and IBF have the same sequence , although the possibility that IBR and IBF were the products of alternative splicing was not ruled out .
To examine this , purified IBR , IBF , and rIBR were reacted with BNPS-skatole , a reagent that specifically cleaves at tryptophan residues ( 16 ) , and the products of cleavage were analyzed by Western blot .
Figure 6 shows that the affinity-purified anti-rIBR antibody recognized the same partial digestion products of the three proteins , further indicating that IBR and IBF have identical amino acid sequences .
Although we can not completely exclude that IBR and IBF differ by the presence or absence of a short peptide sequence , the almost identical sequences of IBR and NRF-1/ « -Pal and the identical electrophoretic mobilities of IBF and NRF-1/a-Pal make this possibility remote .
IBR and IBF differ in extent of glycosylation .
If IBR and IBF have the same primary structure , it follows that their different electrophoretic behaviors should reflect differential posttranslational modifications .
Since previous results have suggested that IBR contains N-acetylglucosamine residues ( 25 ) , we investigated whether IBR and IBF had different degrees of glycosylation .
Nuclear extracts from erythrocytes and HD3 cells were fractionated into succinylated WGA-binding and non Vou .

Glycosylation of IBR .
( A ) Nuclear extracts ( NE ) from mature erythrocytes ( ME ) and HD3 cells were fractionated into WGA-binding ( B1 ) and nonbinding ( FT1 ) proteins .
IBR and IBF from each of the fractions were purified by DNA affinity chromatography and separated again into WGA-binding ( B2 ) and nonbinding ( FT2 ) fractions .
( B ) Gel retardation assays of a °°P-labeled oligonucleotide probe of the A5 gene ( -20 to +14 ) incubated with proteins from the fractions described for panel A .
Lanes W contained wash fractions between the flowthrough and 0.3 M N-acetylglucosamine elution .
binding proteins ( Fig .
7A ) , and the presence of the factors in the various fractions was detected by gel retardation assays with the 25 probe ( Fig .
7B ) .
As expected , IBR from the erythrocyte extract was retained by the WGA column , and it was subsequently eluted with N-acetylglucosamine .
On the other hand , IBF from the HD3 extract was only partially retained under the same conditions ( Fig .
7B ) .
Although this suggested that IBF was partially glycosylated , as reported for other transcription factors that behaved in this way in a similar assay ( 38 ) , the possibility existed that the proteins were indirectly retained by WGA through specific or nonspecific interactions with other glycosylated proteins .
Therefore , IBR and IBF from the WGA-bound and nonbound fractions were purified by DNA affinity chromatography , and their ability to bind WGA as purified proteins was reassessed .
Clearly , while purified IBR was quantitatively retained by the second WGA column and was eluted with N-acetylglucosamine , IBF was not retained whether or not it belonged to the original WGA-bound or unbound fraction ( Fig .
7B ) .
Since the behavior of IBF was not due to the action of deglycosylases that could be present in the extract , as judged from the mobility of IBF in the original extract and purified fraction , the results demonstrated that IBF is either not glycosylated or glycosylated to a much lesser MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF IBR/F ( GRF-1 ) 6677 extent than IBR .
Other experiments also indicated that IBF from HeLa cells ( i.e .
, NRF-1/ « -Pal ) , rat liver , and chicken brain was not detectably glycosylated , whereas IBR from 5-day embryonic erythrocytes was partially glycosylated .
We concluded that IBR is a glycosylated form of IBF and that , within the limits of detection , IBR glycosylation is an erythrocyte-specific modification .
Therefore , the differential glycosylation of IBR is probably responsible for its slower electrophoretic mobility , since treatment of purified IBR and IBF with acid or alkaline phosphatases did not change their electrophoretic mobilities ( not shown ) .
Phosphorylation of IBR/F .
Despite the negative phosphatase results , we determined whether IBR/F is phosphorylated in vivo because phosphorylation mediates a variety of biological responses ( 36 ) and details about the responsible kinases may give information on the regulatory pathways in which the factor is involved .
Immature erythrocytes were incubated with and IBR/F was immunoprecipitated from the nuclear extract with affinity-purified anti-rIBR antibodies .
Autoradiog-raphy of the immunoprecipitated proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane revealed a doublet ( Fig .
8A , lane a ) corresponding to IBR , as demonstrated by treatment of the same membrane with anti-rIBR antibodies ( Fig .
8A , lanes b to d ) .
A survey of the IBR/F sequence for possible kinase consensus sites indicated that the region extending from 38 to 70 contained a cluster of four CK-II and one mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase consensus sites .
The clustering of sites and their evolutionary conservation ( Fig .
2 and 4 ) hinted that they could be actual phosphorylation sites .
This was tested by incubation of rIBR with purified CK-II in the presence of [ y- > P ] JATP .
Figure 8B shows that rIBR was indeed phosphorylated and that phosphorylation was dependent on the presence of CK-II .

6678 GOMEZ-CUADRADO ET AL .
lacking the 79 N-terminal amino acids , was not phosphorylated ( Fig .
8B ) .
Therefore , at least one of the putative CK-II sites was recognized by the kinase .
Similar experiments were carried out with activated p42 MAP kinase from mitogen-stimulated p42* `` ~-transfected CCL39 cells .
The results indicated that this particular MAP kinase was not able to phosphorylate rIBR ( Fig .
8C ) , even though parallel control experiments with myelin basic protein ( a substrate of MAP kinases ) indicated that was active .
The labeling of rIBR that was observed in these experiments was due to a contaminating constitutive protein ki-nase ( s ) , since it was independent of p42* `` `` * expression or mitogen activation of the cells .
The above results indicate that CK-II is potentially one of the kinases that phosphorylate IBR/F in vivo , but they do not exclude the action of other kinases .
Thus , the same N-terminal region contains two CK-I consensus sites , and the DNA-binding/dimerization domain contains a possible p34 `` `` and several possible DNA-dependent kinase sites .
Selection of binding sites from random oligonucleotides .
The finding that IBR is the chicken homolog of human NRF-1/a-Pal was surprising because their DNA recognition sequences appeared to be rather different .
In the case of NRF-1 , a consensus motif , YGCGCAYGCGCR ( where Y is C or T and R is G or A ) , was derived from comparison of the sequences recognized by the factor in a few promoters ( 19 ) .
In the case of « -Pal , the palindrome TGCGCATGCGCA was derived from a statistical analysis of 67 sequences bound by the factor after only a single cycle of selection with a probe containing randomized ( N ) , , tracts ( 18 ) .
As in the case of NRF-1 , the optimal sequence did not differ significantly from that present in the eif-2a promoter used to identify the factor .
Because the con-sensus/optimal NRF-1/a « -Pal DNA-binding sequences did not readily conform to the A5 binding sequence ( 25 ) ( see also Fig .
3 ) , and because a 14-bp randomized stretch could impose constraints on a 12-bp binding factor , we decided to independently determine the optimal sequences recognized by IBR .
A large molar excess of a pool of oligonucleotides containing centrally located ( N ) ; , random tracts was incubated with purified IBR , and the complexes were enriched by WGA affinity chromatography , taking advantage of IBR glycosylation ( see Fig .
7 ) .
After the resin was washed under more stringent salt conditions , the bound complexes were eluted with N-acetylglucosamine , and the DNA moiety was amplified by PCR and used in a subsequent selection cycle .
Figure 9A shows a summary of 54 independent sequences selected by IBR after five consecutive cycles .
The palindromic direct repeat sequence TGCGCATGCGCA , identical to that reported for « -Pal ( 18 ) , was derived .
However , we noticed that the perfect palindrome and half-palindrome sequences represented 1.8 and 66 % of the binding sites , respectively , suggesting that the factor could bind modified versions of the palindrome with high affinity .
In fact , the central 8-bp palindrome CGCATGCG was present in 54 % of the sequences , and this number increased to 81 % if allowance was made for one mismatch that conserved the alternating purine-pyrimidine motif of the sequence .
To further test the significance of the palindrome , three supplementary selection cycles were performed , and the sequence of 24 additional binding sites was determined .
The results ( Fig .
9B ) strengthened the statistical significance of the perfect palindrome , the frequency of which increased to 8.3 % , but also revealed that the 8-bp palindrome CGCATGCG was present in 83 % of the clones .
Again , this number raised to 96 % if one transition change was allowed in the alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence .
We note that despite the AT bias at the dyad of the palindrome , a sequence containing GC at this Mor .

IBR binding site selection .
Purified IBR was incubated with a pool of 53-mer oligonucleotides containing random ( N ) ; , stretches in the middle of the sequence .
Complexes were purified by WGA-Sepharose chromatography , and the oligonucleotide moieties were amplified by PCR and used in a subsequent cycle of selection .

Nucleotides in lowercase letters correspond to the constant sequence of the 53-mer flanking the random ( N ) ; , tracts .
position was obtained even after eight cycles of selection ( Fig .
9B ) .
Hence , although the perfect 12-bp palindrome is probably the highest affinity site for IBR , the more general consensus sequence RCGCRYGCGY is more appropriate as a representative of potential high-affinity sites ( see Discussion ) .
IBR might thus recognize structural characteristics of DNA other than sequence , since alternate purine-pyrimidine sequences have the potential to adopt a z-DNA conformation ( 91 ) .
IBR and IBF associate as stable homodimers .
The fact that the recognition site of IBR is a palindrome insinuated that the factor binds to DNA as a dimer , in accordance with the Stokes ' radius determined by molecular filtration ( not shown ) .
On the other hand , because the optimal recognition sequence is also a direct repeat , the possibility that IBR binds to DNA as two independent monomers could not be dismissed .
To investigate the type of complex made in solution , IBR and IBF were reacted with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde , and the products of the reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with affinity-purified anti-r [ BR antibodies .
Figure 10A shows that the monomer species were cross-linked into dimers , by comparison with the mobility of standard proteins , and that no higher-order oligomers were produced .

( A ) IBR and IBF associate and bind to DNA as homodimers .
Approximately 50 ng of IBR or partially purified IBF was reacted with glutaraldehyde ( final concentrations : 0.005 , 0.01 , 0.025 , and 0.1 % ) for 30 min at 30°C .
The products of the reactions were analyzed by Western blot with purified anti-IBR ( IBR ) or anti-r [ BR ( IBF ) IgG .
The apparent molecular masses of the monomer and dimer species were determined by comparison with that of standard proteins run in a parallel lane .
( B ) Gel retardation assays of °°P-labeled 24-mer oligonucleotide probes containing either the -10 to +14 sequences of A5 ( A5 ) , a perfect palindrome ( PAL ) , or a perfect half palindrome ( 1/2 PAL ) , incubated without protein ( - ) or with 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 0.7 , 4 , 3 , or 6 ng of affinity-purified IBR .
probably related to the presence of other proteins in the partially purified sample .
Under the same conditions , the mono-meric histone HS was cross-linked into higher-order oligomers ( not shown ) .
Therefore , the homodimer is the main molecular form of IBR and IBF at the concentration of protein used .
We next determined if the dimer was the active DNA-binding species by characterizing the complexes formed by IBR with probes containing the 12-bp palindrome ( PAL ) , the 6-bp half-palindrome ( 1/2 PAL ) , and the A5 sequences .
Gel retardation assays indicated that at the IBR concentrations tested , the complexes had identical electrophoretic mobilities ( Fig .
10B ) , implying that IBR recognized the probes as an identical molecular species whether or not the site contained the full or the half recognition sequence .
Because no faster-mobility complex could be detected even at the lowest protein concentrations used , it follows that the monomer can not stably interact with DNA and that the homodimer is the relevant DNA-binding species .
We designed experiments to estimate the stability of the dimers according to the reaction P2P , K where P represents the concentration of monomers and P ; is the concentration of dimers .
At equilibrium , K = [ P , ] / [ P ] is the dissociation constant of dimers .
For the experiments , increasing concentrations of rIBR were incubated for 30 min prior to addition of a constant excess of the PAL probe , and the amount of protein-DNA complex formed at equilibrium was measured by gel retardation assays .
Since the DNA was in MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF IBR/F ( GRF-1 ) 6679 excess , the concentration of dimers at each protein input was estimated to be equal to the concentration of the DNA complex [ P , D ] , and the monomer concentration was calculated by subtracting the dimer concentration from the total protein concentration .
The apparent dissociation constant , calculated from the slope of the plot of P , D versus [ P ] ( Fig .
11A ) , varied between 4.3 X 10~® and 7.6 x 10~® M in different experiments .
Since our approach underestimates the dimer concentration , the actual dissociation constant should be even lower than that calculated .
In any case , the result indicates that the dimer is very stable and suggests that , unless properly destabilized , the IBR/F dimer may not easily exchange subunits with other as yet unknown factors ( see Discussion ) .
Kinetics of DNA binding by IBR .
The equilibrium dissociation constant for the optimal palindrome TGCGCATGCGCA has recently been reported for « -Pal as 6.5 x 10~* ' M ( 18 ) , a value which is of the same order of magnitude as the one that we determined for IBR ( not shown ) .
Competition experiments indicated that the affinity of IBR for site C/D of A5 ( Fig .
3 ) and the half-palindrome TGCGCA was 10-fold lower than for the 12-bp palindrome ( not shown ; see Fig .
10B ) .
Thus , although the contacts determining the stability of the IBR-DNA complex probably occur between each monomer and the CGC/ GCG sequences surrounding the central RY dyad , the results indicate that insofar as one of the subunits establishes specific contacts with DNA , the other subunit can accommodate a variety of other sequences at a relatively low thermodynamic cost for the complex .
To characterize the kinetics of IBR interaction with those sequences , the apparent association and dissociation rates of the DNA complexes were determined .
Surprisingly , the apparent association rate to the palindrome was between 1.6 and 1.8 times slower than that to the A5 sequence ( Fig .
11C ) .
Since the effect was reproducible , the result may indicate that stable binding of IBR to the palindrome requires a structural transition to occur in the complex , a transition which may not occur in the imperfect A5 sequence .
On the other hand , the half-life of the £5 complex was 15 times shorter than that of the palindrome complex , the t , , , of the palindrome and A5 complex being 38 and 2.5 min , respectively ( Fig .
11B ) .
The high off-rate of the A5 complex suggests that the transcriptional effect of IBR on the A5 promoter should be highly sensitive to the intracellular concentration of the factor .
DNA-binding and dimerization domains of IBR .
To dissect the functional domains of IBR , a series of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants ( summarized in Fig .
12A ) were expressed in E. coli .
The recombinant proteins were efficiently synthesized in bacteria ( Fig .
12B ) and soluble under nondenaturing con-ditions .
The DNA-binding activity of the purified proteins was analyzed by gel retardation assays with the PAL probe , whereas their ability to form dimers was assessed in parallel experiments by glutaraldehyde cross-linking .
Mutant AN110 was not included in this study because the majority of molecules were cleaved at an internal site in £ .
coli ( Fig .
12B ) .
The results of the gel retardation assays ( Fig .
12C ) indicated that all mutants except AN172 and AC247 were able to form complexes AN79 , which is not shown in the figure , was also able to form a complex ) .
Therefore , the outer limits of the DNA-binding/dimerization domain , which comprises most of the evolutionarily conserved region , is defined by deletions AN127 and AC283 ( Fig .
12A and C ) .
Glutaraldehyde cross-linking indicated that all the mutants except AN172 efficiently formed dimers ( not shown ) .
The AN172 monomer was cross-linked into higher-order oligomers with no pause at the dimeric form , indicating the lack of a definite complex .
These results , summarized in Fig .

The DNA-binding domain of IBR , which is relatively proline-rich and neutral in charge , shows none of the typical motifs found in other transcription factors , including zinc fingers , b-ZIP , basic helix-loop-helix , and helix-turn-helix .
The region encompassing residues 232 to 255 has the loose consensus of a homeobox domain signature .
However , it is unlikely that a typical helix-turn-helix can be formed because the region that should correspond to helix II ( 24 ) is punctuated with proline residues and therefore can not adopt an « -helix conformation .
Nuclear targeting of IBR .
We examined whether the evolutionarily conserved bipartite NLS which lies at the N-terminal side of the dimerization/DNA-binding domain ( Fig .
2 and 4 ) was functional .
Transformed H32 quail fibroblasts were transfected with RSV vectors expressing the collection of IBR deletion mutants described above , and the cellular compartmentaliza-tion of the proteins was determined by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy .
The primary antibody used for detection of the N-terminal deletion mutants was directed against an SV40 T antigen epitope tag ( 49 ) introduced at the C terminus of IBR .

See Fig .
12A for maps of the deletion mutants .
diluted anti-rIBR was used as the primary antibody because a short FLAG epitope tag ( 6 ) , introduced at the N terminus of IBR , was not recognized by the commercial antibodies .
The results indicated that the antibodies specifically recognized the presence of the transgenic IBR and that , in the case of anti-rIBR , the endogenous factor did not interfere with the analysis because of its lower relative concentration with respect to that of the transgenic proteins ( however , when the concentration of anti-rIBR antibodies was increased 20-fold , the nontransfected cells showed the same type of nuclear fluorescence as the transfected cells , and no fluorescence was detected if the antibodies were preincubated with rIBR ) .
Figure 13A shows a transfected cell expressing transgenic IBR reacted either with the monoclonal antibody against the T antigen epitope ( arrow-head , green fluorescence in the original ) or with diluted affinity-purified anti-rIBR ( arrow , red fluorescence in the original ) .
The two antibodies gave intense granular nuclear fluorescence and the nucleoli were negative , whereas the nontransfected cells present in the preparation showed no nuclear fluorescence ( see , for example , Fig .
13B ) .
Deletion of residues 1 to 49 ( Fig .
13B ) and 1 to 79 ( Fig .
13C ) at the N terminus did not affect the nuclear localization of the proteins , whereas mutations removing sequences 1 to 127 and 1 to 172 resulted in lack of nuclear fluorescence ( not shown ) , even though control experiments indicated that the cells had been transfected .
Since the AN127 and AN172 mutants also failed to accumulate in the 6682 GOMEZ-CUADRADO ET AL .
cytoplasm , the results indicate that deletion of residues 79 to 127 removed the nuclear targeting sequence and/or destabi-lized the proteins .
On the other hand , removal of C-terminal sequences from 503 to 424 , 333 , 300 , 283 , and 247 produced proteins that localized in the nucleus ( Fig .
13D to H ) .
These results argue that the bipartite NLS , encompassing residues 89 to 106 , is necessary for nuclear targeting of IBR .
DISCUSSION Cloning of IBR eDNA .
To characterize IBR , we have isolated its cDNA from a chicken erythrocyte library .
The results indicate that peIBR encodes IBR .
( i ) The ORF included the sequences of the four peptides obtained from purified IBR .
( ii ) The recombinant protein had the expected size , gave identical footprints to IBR on the A5 promoter , and formed complexes with DNA having the same electrophoretic mobility as IBR .
( iii ) Anti-IBR IgG recognized the recombinant protein and vice versa .
( iv ) The peptides produced from IBR and rIBR by cleavage at tryptophan residues had identical electrophoretic mobilities .
The predicted sequence of IBR indicated that the factor is a member of a family of evolutionarily related factors that includes sea urchin P3A2 ( 11 ) , Drosophila EWG ( 17 ) , and human NRF-1/ « a-Pal ( 18 , 88 ) .
In fact , IBR/F and NRF-1/ « -Pal are 99 % identical in sequence .
Relationship of IBR with IBF .
We have shown that IBR from erythrocytes and IBF from HD3 cells are products of the same gene that most likely have the same amino acid sequence .
( i ) Partial IBF cDNAs had sequences identical to IBR cDNA ( unpublished observations ) .
( ii ) The IBR gene is single copy .
( iii ) The IBR cDNA hybridized to a 3.6 X 10° nucleotide-long RNA from erythrocytes ( containing IBR but not IBF ) and HD3 cells ( containing IBF but not IBR ) .
( iv ) IBR and IBF gave identical footprints on the 25 promoter and formed complexes with DNA having the same electrophoretic mobilities .
( v ) IBF and NRF-1 had the same electrophoretic mobility and were recognized by anti-IBR and anti-rIBR IgG .
( vi ) The peptides produced by cleavage of IBR and IBF at tryptophan residues had the same electrophoretic mobilities .
Although we can not completely rule out that IBR and IBF are the products of alternative splicing differing by the presence or absence of a short peptide sequence , our evidence and the independent cloning of the human cDNAs for NRF-1 ( 88 ) and « -Pal ( 18 ) , which predicts a protein of the same size and essentially the same sequence as IBR , do not support this possibility .
Posttranslational modifications of IBR and IBF .
We have shown that the difference in apparent molecular mass between IBR and IBF is probably due to the differential glycosylation of these factors .
Purified IBR but not IBF was able to bind succinylated WGA , which is specific for N-acetylglucosamine ( G1-cNAc ) residues .
Although the nature of the glycosidic linkage was not determined , we presume , by analogy to other glycosylated intracellular proteins ( 30 ) , that several monosaccharide moieties are linked to hydroxyl groups of serine or threonine residues ( O-GlcNAc ) .
The IBR glycosylated form appears to specifically occur in maturing and mature adult erythrocytes , whereas the apparently nonglycosylated IBF form was found in earlier erythroid precursors and other types of cells ( liver , brain , MSB-1 , HeLa , NIH 3T3 , and L cells ) from several vertebrates ( human , mouse , rat , and chicken ) .
O-GlcNAc glycosylation of transcription factors has been extensively documented in the cases of Sp1 ( 38 ) and serum response transcription factor ( SRF ) ( 68 ) .
In vitro assays indicated that SRF glycosylation plays no major role in DNA Mor .

BioL .
binding ( 50 , 53 ) .
In the case of Sp1 , the nonglycosylated recombinant protein was able to bind to DNA but showed reduced ability to transactivate ( 38 ) .
However , it is not clear whether this was due to the lack of glycosylation , lack of phos-phorylation , or to an anomalous structure of the bacterial protein .
In the case of IBR/F , glycosylation does not appear to alter its ability to dimerize and bind to DNA ( this work ) or to detectably influence its transcriptional effect on the A5 and model promoters in vitro ( 24a ) .
These results notwithstanding , we can not exclude that IBR glycosylation affects its transcriptional properties in other promoter contexts .
For example , the steric effects of the sugar moieties or inhibition of phosphorylation at the glycosylated sites ( 41 ) could modulate its interactions with certain ancillary transcription factors .
We have also shown that IBR/F is phosphorylated in vivo and that CK-II phosphorylates in vitro at least one of four putative sites in the region extending from residues 37 to 67 .
With the caveat that phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo could be unrelated ( 37 ) , the fact that the sites occur in an evolutionarily conserved region suggests that this modification may have a functional role .
CK-II is an essential Ser/Thr protein kinase , the activity of which is higher in tissues of elevated metabolic activity ( 37 ) .
Because no second messengers for CK-II are known ( 37 ) , it is difficult to relate its action to a signal transduction pathway .
Phosphorylation by CK-II may alter the DNA-binding turnover of IBR/F , as in the case of SRF ( 53 ) , Max/Myc , and Max/Max ( 8 ) , or modulate its transcriptional activity , as in the cases of vesicular stomatitis virus phospho-protein P ( 4 ) and the coactivator PC4 ( 23 ) .
CK-II phosphorylation of sites close to the NLS sequence of the SV40 T antigen increase the rate of its nuclear translocation ( 70 ) , and it is perhaps relevant that the NLS of IBR/F lies close to the CK-II sites .
Molecular properties of IBR/F .
A comparison of IBR/F with the related factors indicates that the half N-terminal region has been evolutionarily conserved between the vertebrate and invertebrate members of the family .
This region harbors a CK-II site ( s ) , the putative NLS , and the DNA-binding/dimerization domain .
On the other hand , the C-terminal halves have only conserved short patches of homology .
We have presented direct evidence that IBR/F associates as stable dimers in solution and that the dimer is the active DNA-binding species .
Although this result appears to be at variance with the report that NRF-1 binds to DNA as a monomer ( 88 ) , that conclusion was reached from the inability of DNA-binding NRF-1 deletion mutants to form heterodimers , an observation which is in agreement with our own results from similar experiments with IBR/F ( unpublished observations ) .
However , the failure to heterodimerize under the conditions assayed is an expected consequence of the low equilibrium dissociation constant of the homodimers .
We have delimited the outer borders of the DNA-binding/ dimerization domain to the region extending from residues 127 to 283 and shown that the dimerization domain is located at the N-terminal side of the composite domain .
These results are in accordance with the deletion analysis of NRF-1 ( 88 ) , which delimited the outer borders of the DNA-binding domain to the region extending from 105 to 305 , since mutants lacking residues 1 to 144 or 503 to 264 were unable to bind to DNA .
Taking together the IBR/F and NRF-1 deletion data , it can be concluded that the dimerization domain of these factors starts somewhere between residues 127 and 144 and that the DNA-binding domain ends somewhere between residues 264 and 283 .
The DNA-binding/dimerization domain of IBR/F shows none of the typical motifs found in transcription factors , such Vou .
15 , 1995 as zinc fingers , b-ZIP , or bHLH , since the atypical b-ZIP region proposed for « -Pal ( 18 ) was dispensable for both dimerization and DNA binding of the AN127 IBR mutant .
An analysis of the domain with algorithms for prediction of secondary structure hints that the regions most likely to adopt an « -helix conformation are confined to residues 160 to 175 and 240 to 283 , the latter having some resemblance to the DNA-binding helix III of the homeodomain ( 24 ) .
At this stage , we do not know whether the homology is relevant , and structural work will be needed to clarify this issue .
Transcription factors very often exist as families of related members that recognize identical or similar DNA sequences .
The families may originate from the same gene by alternative splicing or alternative polyadenylation , for example , ATF/CREB ( 28 ) and E12/E47 ( 83 ) , and/or from related genes coding for partially homologous proteins , such as NF-1 ( 76 ) , GATA ( 93 ) , and Sp1 ( 27 ) .
Family members can usually be distinguished by their different mRNA sizes or by the distinct electrophoretic mobilities of their complexes with DNA .
Using a variety of nuclear extracts , we have not been able to detect specific DNA complexes other than those made by IBR/F .
These results , together with other data presented in this work and the lethal phenotype of the ewg null mutants ( 17 ) , raise the interesting possibility that , in a given species , there might be no other highly related family members acting at the same sequences .
Moreover , the high stability of the IBR/F homodimer makes the likelihood of subunit exchange with possible partners somehow remote , thus further restricting , although not eliminating , another potential source of functional diversity .
Possible roles of IBR/F .
To gain wider insight into the genes that might be regulated by IBR/F , a homology search of the GenBank database was carried out with the alternating purine-pyrimidine IBR/F consensus and the restrictive proviso that the sequence should appear no farther than 300 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site .
Although the presence of the IBR/F cognate sequence is not a proof of its activity , we noticed in a significant number of cases that the sequence and its location have been evolutionarily conserved , arguing for its functionality .
This analysis revealed a set of 88 genes ( the list of which , with the locations of the putative IBR/F sites , is available upon request ) , some of which are known to be regulated by IBR/NRF-1/ « -Pal ( 9 , 13 , 19 , 22 , 35 , 39 , 75 ) .
Interestingly , the palindrome TGCGCATGCGCA was present in only two of the scored genes ( 31 , 32 ) whereas it did not occur in the genes known to be regulated by this family of factors ( 9 , 13 , 19 , 22 , 25 , 35 , 39 ) .
This indicates that high-affinity sites do depart from the perfect palindrome , in accordance with our binding-site selection data .
With a few exceptions , the overwhelming majority of scored genes were TATA-less genes coding for housekeeping enzymatic activities expressed in most tissues , although at various levels .
Examples include genes involved in signal transduction ( insulin-like growth factor receptor I [ 14 ] , c-Ha-ras [ 48 ] , Ga , [ 47 ] , Ca** -binding proteins [ 3 , 29 , 43 ] , the regulatory subunit of phosphatase 2A [ 55 ] , and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase [ 46 ] ) , mitochondrial energy transduction ( cytochrome ¢ and several subunits of cyto-chrome c oxidase [ 13 , 19 , 88 ] , 5-aminolevulinate synthase [ 5-ALAS ] [ 9 ] , and subunit y of ATPase/synthase [ 13 , 54 ] ) , protein metabolism ( subunits « and B of the translation initiation factor eIF-2 [ 13 , 18 , 39 ] , the $ 16 ribosomal protein [ 89 ] , disulfide isomerase [ 86 ] , and proteases specific for short-lived or defective proteins , such as the proteasome HC3 [ 84 ] and the calcium-activated neutral protease [ 31 ] ) , lipid metabolism ( subunit Ela of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase [ 52 ] , sterol and androgen carrier proteins [ 65 , 80 ] , lipoprotein receptor [ 22 ] , acetyl coenzyme A binding protein [ 51 ] , carbonyl MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF IBR/F ( GRF-1 ) 6683 reductase [ 20 ] , and alcohol dehydrogenase [ 7 ] ) , and nucleic acid metabolism ( DNA polymerase a [ 63 ] , the 14.5-kDa subunit of RNA polymerase II [ 1 ] , topoisomerase I [ 45 ] , mitochondrial transcription factor A [ mTFA ] [ 61 ] , inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase type II [ 94 ] , hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase [ 56 ] , glutamine phosphoribosylpy-rophosphate amidotransferase [ GPAT ] and 5'-phosphoribo-sylaminoimidazole carboxylase [ AIRC ] [ 10 ] , GADD1S3 [ 62 ] , ERCC2 [ 90 ] , RNase MRP [ 12 , 58 ] , UZaf-binding protein [ 32 ] , retinoblastoma [ 85 ] , prohibitin [ 60 ] , cyclin B1 [ 66 ] , and RCCI [ 21 ] ) .
In addition to housekeeping functions , IBR/F may also regulate tissue-specific genes in certain types of cells , including h5 ( 25 ) , e-myb ( 26 , 40 ) , preproenkephalin A ( 87 ) , synapsin I ( 77 ) , acetylcholine receptor ( 33 ) , and slow sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-dependent ATPase ( 71 ) .
Although more functional data are needed , it appears possible that IBR/F and related factors are primarily involved in the coregulation of networks of genes involved in growth-related functions .
Therefore , to unify the present nomencla-tures , we would like to propose the more general term GRF-1 ( growth regulatory factor 1 ) to describe IBR/F and related factors because it appears to portray their functions more appropriately than the current particular definitions .
