6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; Cyclosporin A-Resistant Transactivation of the IL-2 Promoter Requires Activity of Okadaic Acid-Sensitive Serine/Threonine Phosphatases ' Gabriele Nebl , `` Stefan C. Meuer , and Yvonne Samstag Expression of the IL-2 gene requires activation of T cells through stimulation of the TCR and costimulation through accessory receptors .
We have found recently that okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases are involved in a cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway that selectively transmits costimulatory signals .
In this study , we analyzed whether activities of these phosphatases are necessary for the expression of the IL-2 gene .
In both activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes and activated tumorigenic T cell lines , IL-2 gene expression was blocked at the transcriptional level by okadaic acid .
The transcription factors active at the IL-2 promoter were differentially influenced : upon down-modulation of okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases , transactivation by oc-tamer , NF-B , and NF of activated T cells proteins was abrogated , while transactivation by AP-1 proteins was even enhanced .
- The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 161 : 1803-1810. ull activation of T lymphocytes requires two types of sig-nals : those provided through the TCR/CD3 complex , and in addition , those induced by stimulation of coreceptors such as CD2 , CD4 , CD8 , or CD28 ( for review , see Ref .
1 ) .
T cell activation in the absence of costimulation leads to anergy or apoptosis ( 2-5 ) .
Signaling events induced by coreceptors overlap in part with the TCR signaling pathway .
Recently , intracellular reactions clearly independent of the TCR have been identified ( 6 , 7 ) .
Expression of the IL-2 gene depends on an activation of both coreceptor- and TCR-triggered signal-transduction pathways ( for review , see Ref .
8 ) .
These influence the activities of the transcription factors that mediate IL-2 transcription , namely Oct , `` AP-1 , NF- « B , and NF-AT proteins ( for review , see Ref .
9 ) .
Protein kinase C is involved in the activation of the NF-KB transcription factor proteins , which requires their release from inactive cyto-plasmic complexes ( 10-13 ) .
Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family regulate expression and activity of AP-1 proteins ( 14-16 ) .
The Ca/calmodulin-regulated Ser/Thr phosphatase 2B ( PP2B ) /calcineurin regulates the nuclear entry of the cytoplas-mic components of the transcription factor NF-AT ( 17-19 ) .
Additional phosphatases , namely okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases , were recently identified to be crucial for a cyclosporin A ( CsA ) -insensitive pathway , which is induced through the CD2 and CD28 coreceptors ( 6 , 20 , 21 ) .
Ser/Thr phosphatases are encoded by the gene families PPM and PPP .
The PPP family comprises the subfamilies 1 , 2A , 2B , and 5 .

During the CD2/CD28-induced signaling pathway , dephosphor-ylation of the essential phosphoprotein pp19/cofilin is catalyzed by okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases .
Since dephosphory-lation of ppl9/cofilin correlates with IL-2 production , we addressed the question as to whether okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases influence the expression of the IL-2 gene .
In this study , we show that indeed activities of okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases are necessary to achieve transactivation of the IL-2 promoter by the NF-AT , NF-KB , and Oct transcription factor proteins .
Materials and Methods Cell lines , tissue culture , and transfection procedure Human primary T cells were prepared as described previously ( 21 ) .
EL4 cells and Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 5 % ( ELA ) or 10 % ( Jurkat ) FCS ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
The Jurkat cell clone IL-2-luc stably transfected with the plasmid pIL-ZlucZkb ( 23 ) was a gift from B. Schraven Institute for Immunology , Heidelberg , Germany ) .
EL4 cells were transfected , as described previously ( 24 ) , using 1 ug of plasmid DNA per 2 X 10° cells .
The constructs used were pmoIL2-2k-luc , pmoIL2-321-luc , and the control vector pUCOOluc ; octp-luc , NFxB-luc , NFAT-luc , and the control vector pGL2 ( 25 ) ; 5X TRE-TATA CAT and the control vector TATA CAT ( 26 ) ; and 4 % oct-luc and the control vector 4X oct mut-lue ( 27 ) .
Sixteen hours after transfection , cells were split in aliquots and treated with various stimulating agents .
The concentrations used were 0.5 uM okadaic acid ( Life Technologies ) ; 0.1 pg/ml CsA ( Sandoz , Basel , Swit-zerland ) ; 10 ng/ml PMA ( Sigma ) ; 180 nM A23187 ( Sigma ) ; 10 pg/ml CD2 Abs M1 , M2 , and 3PT ( 28 , 29 ) ; and 1 pg/ml CD28 Ab 9.3 ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) .
Luciferase assay and CAT assay Luciferase assays were performed with the Luciferase Assay System ( Pro-mega , Madison , WI ) .
CAT assays were conducted using CAT ELISA ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
Isolation of RNA and Northern analysis RNA was extracted from cells by a guanidinium isothiocyanate method .
Before loading on a 1 % agarose gel ( 1 % in 1X MOPS ; 1X MOPS equals 20 mM MOPS ( 3- [ N-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid , 5 mM sodium ac-etate , 1 mM EDTA ) ) , RNA samples were adjusted to 25 % formamide , 1.1 M formaldehyde , 0.5X MOPS , 0.5 % Ficoll , and 0.1 % bromphenol blue .
0022-1767/98/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 1804 After electrophoresis , gels were blotted onto Hybond N* filters ( Amer-sham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Prehybridization and hybridization were conducted at 65°C in solution HS ( 7 % SDS , 1 mM EDTA , 0.5 % phosphate buffer ( 1 % phosphate buffer equals 2 M Na , HPO,2H,0 , 0.34 % phosphoric acid ) ) .
For hybridization , cDNA probes ( G-actin , human IL-2 , murine IL-2 ( 30-32 ) ) were labeled radioactively using a random hexanucleotide priming procedure ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
Blot washes ( at 65°C ) were performed with 0.04X phosphate buffer , 1 mM EDTA , 5 % SDS , and 0.04 % phosphate buffer , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % SDS .
Finally , the blots were exposed to autoradiography .
Nuclear run-on analysis Nuclear run-on analysis was performed , as described previously ( 33 ) , using cDNA probes for the B-actin gene , the IL-2 gene , the c-jun gene , and the c-fos gene ( 30 , 31 , 34 , 35 ) for the detection of the respective transcripts .
In vivo footprinting In vivo footprinting was performed essentially as described ( 36 ) .
The oli-gonucleotide primers used to visualize the coding strand of the c-fos promoter were synthesized according to a previous report ( 37 ) .
Quantitation of band intensities was performed through scanning of the autoradiograms using a Saphir Ultra laser densitometer .
From top to bottom of each lane of the autoradiogram , an intensity profile was produced using the Image Quant 3.0 software ( Fuji ) .
Subsequently , the intensity values of individual profile peaks were determined .
Intensity values of affected bands were related to the intensity value of a nonaffected band in the same area of the gel to compensate for loading differences ( relative intensity values ) .
For graph representation , relative intensity values obtained from an in vitro methylated DNA band were set 1 , and the relative intensity values of corresponding bands in the four in vivo DNA preparations were related to it .
G ~* `` of the Oct site , G ** of the OAP site , G '® and G* of the NF-AT site , and G ' and G* `` of the AP-1 site were analyzed as individual bands , while G ' and G ' of the ATGG site , G ** , G ** , and G ** `` of the NF-xB site , and G* and G* `` of the TGGGC site were pooled with neighboring bands .
At the ATGG , NF-KB , and TGGGC sites , in vivo methylated DNAs are hyperreactive when compared with in vitro methylated DNA ( Fig .
7 ) .
This situation occurring at the coding strand of the IL-2 promoter has been described earlier .
Its significance remains unknown ( 36 ) .
Results Okadaic acid prevents IL-2 expression in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes Activation of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes ( PBL-T ) was performed using a combination of mitogenic Abs directed at the CD2 coreceptor or , alternatively , by phorbolester and Ca ionophore ( PMA + A23187 ) .
CD2 triggering provides an activation signal to T cells ( 28 , 38 ) .
Phorbolesters induce the activation of protein kinase C , whereas Ca ionophores lead to an elevation of intracellular calcium .
This treatment mimics intracellular signals induced by antigenic stimulation of T cells via TCR/CD3 and coreceptors ( 39 ) .
As expected , Northern blot analysis showed that both stimulation protocols induced the accumulation of IL-2 mRNA ( Fig .
1 , lanes 3 and 5 ) , which was prevented completely when okadaic acid was added 30 min before stimulation at concentrations known to inhibit the okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases of subfamilies 1 , 2A , and 5 ( 22 , 27 , 40 , 41 ) ( Fig .
1 , lanes 4 and 6 ) .
This treatment did not generally affect the functional activity of the cells , since a nuclear run-on analysis ( see below , Fig .
2 ) revealed that other transcriptional processes were ongoing throughout cell treatment .
These results show that inhibition of okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases abrogates the expression of the IL-2 gene in activated PBL-T cells .
Okadaic acid blocks IL-2 expression at the transcriptional level We then analyzed the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of IL-2 expression by okadaic acid .
Specifically , we addressed the question as to whether okadaic acid treatment results in mRNA destabilization and/or reduced mRNA synthesis .

Okadaic acid prevents IL-2 mRNA expression in PBL-T. Northern blot analysis was performed with RNA isolated from PBL-T .
Cells were cultured in medium ( Zane 1 ) or treated with okadaic acid ( lane 2 ) , mitogenic CD2 Abs ( Zane 3 ) , okadaic acid and CD2 Abs ( Zane 4 ) , PMA plus A23187 ( lane 5 ) , or okadaic acid and PMA plus A23187 ( lane 6 ) .
Okadaic acid was added 30 min before the stimulating agents ; cells were then triggered for 6 h. Filters were hybridized with radioactively labeled cDNA probes for the human IL-2 gene and the B-actin gene .
between these possibilities , the transcription rate of the IL-2 gene was determined in nuclear run-on experiments ( Fig .
2 ) .
To this end , PBL-T cells were activated through CD2 or by treatment with PMA + A23187 , in the presence or absence of okadaic acid .
Both CD2 triggering and PMA + A23187 treatment induced transcription of the IL-2 gene ( Fig .
2 , lanes 3 and 7 , IL-2 ) , which was inhibited by okadaic acid ( Fig .
2 , lanes 4 and 8 , IL-2 ) .
This effect was not due to a general down-regulation of transcriptional processes by okadaic acid , since the B-actin gene was transcribed at similar levels in both groups of differently treated cells ( Fig .
2 , B-actin ) .
Moreover , transcription of the AP-1 transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun , detectable in resting and activated PBL-T cells ( Fig .
2 , lanes 5 to 8 ) , was even strongly induced by okadaic acid ( Fig .
2 , lanes 6 and 8 ) .
To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying okadaic acid-mediated inhibition of IL-2 transcription , we performed IL-2 promoter studies using transient transfections of reporter gene constructs or the in vivo footprinting technique .
Since PBL-T cells could not be used due to their limited experimental manipulability , the tumorigenic murine T lymphoma line EL4 and the human T cell line Jurkat were employed .

IL-2 , c-fos , c-jun , and B-actin transcripts were detected with isolated cDNA probes from the respective genes .

Northern blot analysis was performed with RNA isolated from differently treated Jurkat ( Zanes 1-4 ) or ELA ( lanes 5-8 ) cells .
Cells were cultured in medium ( Zanes 7 and 5 ) or treated with okadaic acid ( lanes 2 and 6 ) .

lanes 3 and 7 ) was not induced in Jurkat and ELA cells when the cells were activated in the presence of okadaic acid ( Fig .
3 , lanes 4 and 8 ) .
Thus , the effects of okadaic acid on IL-2 expression are independent of tumorigenic transformation and the differentiation state of the T cell lines used in this study .
In line with a previous report ( 42 ) , okadaic acid treatment of nonstimulated EL4 cells alone induced a low level of IL-2 expression ( Fig .
3 , lane 6 ) .
This effect seems to be peculiar to ELA cells since it was observed neither in PBL-T cells ( compare Fig .
1 , lane 2 ) nor in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
3 , lane 2 ) .
Intriguingly , although okadaic acid treatment alone induced IL-2 expression in ELA cells , this compound completely prevented IL-2 expression in ELA cells following stimulation with PMA + A23187 ( Fig .
3 , lane 8 ) .
Similar results were obtained upon transient transfection of EL4 cells with IL-2 promoter reporter constructs , in which the luciferase gene is driven by the murine IL-2 promoter .
Two IL-2 promoter luciferase constructs containing either the 321-bp IL-2 enhancer ( pmoIL2-321-luc ) or 2-kb upstream sequence of the IL-2 gene ( pmoIL2-2k-luc ) and a corresponding control vector were used ( 25 ) .
The transfected cells were cultured with medium ( - ) , okadaic acid ( OA ) , PMA + A23187 ( P/A ) , or a combination of the three agents ( P/A + OA ) , respectively .
In ELA cells transfected with the control vector , only very low levels of luciferase activity were detected , which were not altered significantly by cell treatment ( Fig .
4 , vector ) .
Irrespective of which of the two IL-2 promoter luciferase constructs was transfected ( Fig .
4 , -2k , -321 ) , luciferase activity was slightly induced by okadaic acid ( Fig .
4 , OA ) and , to a much higher level , by PMA + A23187 ( Fig .
4 , P/A ) .
Addition of okadaic acid completely inhibited the PMA + A23187-inducible activity of both IL-2 promoter constructs ( Fig .
4 , P/A + OA ) .
Taken together , these data show that IL-2 transcription in transformed murine and human T cell lines as well as in primary human blood T cells is influenced strongly by okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases .
Okadaic acid inhibits a CsA-insensitive pathway of IL-2 expression Like okadaic acid , the PP2B/calcineurin inhibitor CsA prevents IL-2 expression via a transcriptional block ( 43 ) .

EL4 cells were transiently transfected with a control vector ( 00-luc ) or two reporter plasmids expressing the luciferase gene under the control of fragments of the murine IL-2 promoter .
-321-luc contains the 321 bp of the IL-2 enhancer , and -2k-luc contains the 2 kb upstream sequence of the IL-2 gene .
Thirty-six hours after transfection , cells were split into four aliquots .
Cells were cultured in medium ( - ) , treated with okadaic acid ( OA ) , or stimulated for 6 h with PMA/A23187 in the absence ( P/A ) or presence ( P/A + OA ) of okadaic acid .
Okadaic acid was added 30 min before stimulation .
Luciferase activities of lysates from the different cell populations were measured and normalized to the amount of protein in each probe .
The figure shows the normalized luciferase activities expressed as multiples of the value measured in untreated cells , which was set 1 .
The data reflect results of five independent experiments .

scription was mediated via inhibition of PP2B/calcineurin , we analyzed whether the PP2B/calcineurin-independent pathway of IL-2 expression induced by a combination of PMA and the activating CD28 Ab 9.3 ( 44 ) could also be inhibited by okadaic acid .
To investigate this point , a Jurkat cell clone stably transfected with the IL-2 enhancer luciferase reporter construct pIL-2lucZkb ( 23 ) was stimulated by a combination of PMA plus CD28 Ab .
This resulted in an induction of luciferase activity , while treatment with each agent alone led to no significant change in the basal level of luciferase activity ( Fig .
5 , compare lanes 1 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) .
Treatment with okadaic acid , but not with CsA , completely abrogated the PMA/anti-CD28-inducible promoter activity ( Fig .
5 , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
In contrast , luciferase activity , induced by a combination of phorbolester and Ca ionophore ( Fig .
5 , lane 9 ) , was prevented completely by both okadaic acid and CsA ( Fig .
5 , lanes 10 and 11 ) .
These data show that okadaic acid inhibits a PP2B/calcineurin-independent pathway involved in IL-2 expression .
Oct- , NF- « B- , NF-AT- , but not AP-I-mediated transcription depends on okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases To determine whether okadaic acid differentially influences the transactivation by individual transcription factors regulating IL-2 promoter activity , luciferase reporter constructs driven by multi-meric NF-AT- , NF- « B- , or Oct-binding elements derived from the IL-2 promoter ( 25 ) or the respective control vector were transfected into EL4 cells .
After transfection , cells were treated with okadaic acid ( OA ) , PMA + A23187 ( P/A ) , or okadaic acid and PMA + A23187 ( P/A + OA ) , respectively .
In the case of okadaic acid treatment of EL4 cells , predominantly the Oct reporter was stimulated , whereas the extent of NF- « B- and NE-AT-reporter induction was very low ( Fig .
6A , OA ) .
PMA + A23187 treatment activated the Oct- , NF- « B- , and NE-AT-reporter constructs ( Fig .
6A , P/A ) , while application of okadaic acid inhibited the PMA + A23187-inducible promoter activities of all three constructs ( Fig .
6A , P/A + OA ) .

Okadaic acid inhibits a CsA-insensitive pathway of IL-2 expression .
Cells from the Jurkat clone Jurkat-IL-2-luc stably transfected with a IL-2 promoter reporter construct were cultured in medium ( Zane 4 , - ) , or treated with okadaic acid ( lane 2 , OA ) , CsA ( lane 3 , CsA ) , PMA ( lane 4 , P ) , the CD28 Ab 9.3 ( lane 5 , 28 ) , or with combinations of PMA plus CD28 Ab ( lanes 6-8 , P/28 ) or PMA plus A23187 ( lanes 9-11 , P/A ) .
Stimulations via P/28 or P/A treatment were performed in the absence of OA and CsA ( lanes 6 and 9 ) or in the presence of OA ( lane 7 , P/28 + OA , and lane 10 , P/A + OA ) or CsA ( lane 8 , P/28 + CsA , and lane 11 , P/A + CsA ) .
Okadaic acid and CsA were added 30 min before stimulation ; cells were then triggered for 6 h. Luciferase activities of lysates from the different cell populations were measured and normalized to the amount of protein in each probe .
The figure shows the normalized luciferase activities expressed as multiples of the value measured in untreated cells , which was set 1 .
The data reflect results of four independent experiments .
Error bars indicate SE of the mean .
The Oct and NF-AT reporters used in Figure 6A contain the composite binding elements of the IL-2 promoter that allow recruitment of AP-1 proteins together with Oct and NF-AT proteins ( 45 , 46 ) .
In addition Oct- and AP-1-dependent transcription was analyzed using Oct- and AP-1-specific reporter constructs ( Fig 6 , B and C ) .
The Oct reporter used contains a multimerized octamer motif ( 27 ) .
It had a high constitutive activity in nonactivated cells ( Fig .
6B , - ) that was not further inducible by PMA + A23187 ( Fig .
6B , P/A ) .
Okadaic acid treatment strongly reduced this activity both in nonactivated and activated cells ( Fig .
6B , P/A + OA ) .
The AP-1 reporter contains a multimerized AP-1 binding site derived from the human collagenase gene ( 26 ) .
The AP-1 reporter was induced by okadaic acid ( Fig .
6C , OA ) or PMA + A23187 treatment ( Fig .
6C , P/A ) , respectively .
In contrast to the results obtained with the Oct- , NF- « B- , and NF-AT-reporter constructs , simultaneous addition of okadaic acid and PMA + A23187 further enhanced the activity of the AP-1 reporter ( Fig .
6C , P/A + OA ) .
These observations imply that the inhibition of the Oct and NF-AT reporters derived from the IL-2 promoter sequence ( Fig .
64 ) is mediated by repression of Oct and NF-AT activity , and not by inhibition of AP-1 .
Determination of the in vivo occupancy of the IL-2 promoter in EL4 cells To analyze the events at the endogenous IL-2 promoter that are influenced by okadaic acid treatment , we used the in vivo footprinting technique by which protein-DNA interactions in intact cells can be visualized .
To this end , ELA cells were treated in culture with the membrane-permeable alkylating agent DMS .
After DMS treatment , piperidine was used to produce DNA cleavage at alkylated G residues .
Resulting fragments spanning the IL-2 promoter region were visualized by the ligation-mediated PCR OKADAIC ACID-SENSITIVE PHOSPHATASES REGULATE IL-2 EXPRESSION technique ( 47 ) , giving a G-specific sequence ladder of the promoter .
DMS footprints ( ie .
, protected or hypersensitive G resi-dues ) indicative of protein binding to the DNA were revealed by comparing the patterns of G-specific sequence ladders obtained from differently stimulated living EL4 cell populations with those obtained from purified and in vitro methylated genomic DNA of ELA cells .
PMA + A23187 treatment of EL4 cells resulted in a change of the pattern of the G-specific sequence ladder as compared with the one detected in unstimulated cells ( Fig .
7 , compare lanes 2 and 4 ) .
Footprints ( i.e .
, reproducible changes of band intensities of at least 25 % ) , as described before ( 36 ) , were visible within the coding strand at the Oct site ( protection at G `` `` ) , the OAP site ( protection at G ** ) , the proximal NF-AT site ( protection at G _*'*° and hypersensitivity at G '* ) , the AP-1 site ( hy-persensitivities at G_'* > and G ' `` ) , the ATGG site ( protections at G ~* `` and G *** ) , the NF- « B site ( protections at G and G* `` ) , the TGGGC site ( protections at G *** and G ~* `` ) , and the distal NF-AT site ( protection at G~_** > and hypersensitivity at G ** `` ) ( Fig .
7 , lane 4 ) .
Okadaic acid treatment of EL4 cells alone reproducibly induced a protection at G `` ' within the Oct site , at G ** within the OAP site , and two hypersensitivities at G ~ ' and G~_'** indicative of protein binding to the AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
7 , lane 3 ) .
This observation correlated with the induction of low levels of IL-2 expression under these conditions ( compare Fig .
3 and Ref .
42 ) as well as with the induction of AP-1 expression ( compare Fig .
2 ) and activity ( compare Fig .
6C ) in okadaic acid-treated cells .
Surprisingly , binding of Oct and AP-1 proteins seemed to be sufficient to induce a low level of IL-2 transcription .
The IL-2 promoter of cells treated with PMA + A23187 in the presence of okadaic acid showed no footprints at all ( Fig .
7 , lane 5 ) .
Thus , in PMA + A23187 plus okadaic acid-treated ELA cells also AP-1 proteins , although activated ( compare Fig .
6C , P/A + OA ) , do not bind to the IL-2 promoter .
The absence of footprints at the IL-2 promoter was gene specific since the cellular c-fos promoter was still occupied under these conditions .
Thus , in vivo footprinting of the same DNA preparations , as used for the IL-2 promoter analysis , revealed the characteristic footprint pattern at the SRE binding region of the c-fos promoter ( data not shown ) ( 37 ) .
These data demonstrate that okadaic acid completely prevents transcription factor binding to the IL-2 promoter in PMA + A23187-stimulated EL4 cells .
Discussion IL-2 is produced by activated T cells .
Its expression is regulated at the transcriptional level .
In addition , posttranscriptional effects on IL-2 mRNA stability have been described ( 48 ) .
In this study , it is demonstrated for the first time that in activated T cells , the inhibitor of Ser/Thr phosphatases of the subfamilies 1 , 2A , and 5 , okadaic acid , prevents IL-2 expression through a transcriptional block .
Okadaic acid treatment caused no general inhibition of transcription since the B-actin , c-fos , and c-jun genes ( Fig .
2 ) and AP-1-dependent reporter genes ( Fig .
6C ) were still transcribed .
There-fore , neither RNA polymerase II nor the basic transcriptional machinery is affected directly by inhibition of these Ser/Thr phosphatases .
Interestingly , okadaic acid treatment differentially affects the po-tencies of individual transcription factors regulating IL-2 transcription .
Thus , while okadaic acid inhibits NF- « B- , Oct- , and NF-AT-mediated transactivation processes during T cell activation , AP-1 activity is even enhanced .

Okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases differentially influence individual transcription factors .
A , ELA cells were transfected with reporter constructs containing multimerized Oct- , NF-B- , or NF-AT-binding elements derived from the murine IL-2 promoter or a control vector .
After transfection , treatment of the cells and determination of luciferase activities were performed , as described in Figure 4 .
B , For analysis of Oct-specific transactivation , the Oct-reporter 4X oct-luc containing a multimerized Oct consensus site ( Oct ( cons . )
) was transfected into ELA cells .
Cells were treated as described above .
C , EL4 cells were transfected with the AP-1 reporter 5X TRE-TATA-CAT containing the AP-1 site from the human collagenase gene ( AP-1 ( coll . )
) or a control vector .
After transfection , cells were treated as described before ( see Fig .
4 ) .
CAT activities in lysates of the different cell populations were determined and normalized to the amount of protein in each probe .
In lysates from cells transfected with the control vector and untreated cells transfected with the AP-1 reporter , no CAT activities were detected .
The normalized CAT activities in the different cell populations are therefore shown as multiples of the value measured in P/A-activated cells , which was set 1 .
The data reflect results of three independent experiments .
Error bars indicate SE of the mean .
Okadaic acid treatment enhances AP-1 activity through an induction of the expression of AP-1 proteins ( Fig .
2 ; see also Ref .
49 ) .
Unexpectedly , this AP-1 expression was still detectable at late times after activation .
In both activated and nonactivated PBL-T cells , okadaic acid treatment resulted in a high transcription rate of AP-1 genes 6 h after stimulation ( see Fig .
2 ) .
Okadaic acid treatment rapidly induces expression of the AP-1 genes c-fos , c-jun , JunB , and junD in ELA cells .
This expression was still detectable 8 h after stimulation ( unpublished data ) .
This kinetics of the AP-1 expression differs from that under other experimental conditions of T cell activation , in which AP-1 expression occurs as an early event followed by a rapid shut-off ( see Ref .
9 for summary ) .
At present , the regulation of this shut-off is not well understood .
One explanation for the AP-1 expression pattern in T cells described in this study could be that okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases are also involved in the down-regulation of AP-1 expression .
In activated T cells , IL-2 transcription was inhibited completely by okadaic acid .
AP-1 activity , which was enhanced under these conditions , was clearly not sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of okadaic acid on the IL-2 promoter .
This could be based on the finding that IL-2 transcription seems to depend on the binding of a complete set of transcription factors to the promoter ( 36 ) , most likely because the IL-2 promoter contains nonconsensus binding sites that favor cooperative transcription factor binding ( 24 ) .
Then , AP-1 proteins , although induced , could not transactivate the IL-2 promoter because their binding affinities toward the nonconsensus AP-1-binding elements would not be strong enough under conditions in which Oct , NF-KB , and NF-AT activities are missing .
Indeed , in vivo footprinting analysis ( Fig .
7 ) showed that the IL-2 promoter in okadaic acid-treated EL4 cells stimulated with PMA + A23187 is not occupied , indicating that transcription was blocked due to complete inhibition of activator binding .
Moreover , no evidence for binding of repressor proteins to the IL-2 promoter was found .
In nonactivated ELA cells , however , okadaic acid treatment led to low expression of IL-2 .
Note that this was the case only in EL4 cells , not in the other transformed and nontransformed T cells analyzed in this study .
Okadaic acid-induced IL-2 expression in ELA cells correlated with footprints only at the Oct site at the noncomposite AP-1 site at nucleotides G ' `` and G~'** , and at the OAP site that is bound by AP-1 proteins ( 46 ) ( compare Fig .
7 ) .
Thus , in nonactivated ELA cells , Oct and AP-1 proteins can induce transcription at the IL-2 promoter in the absence of other transcription factors .
One possibility to explain the opposite effects of okadaic acid on IL-2 transcription in activated and nonactivated ELA cells could be that the accessibility of the IL-2 promoter is different .
Since the binding of AP-1 proteins to the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
7 ) is distinct in activated and nonactivated ELA cells while transactivating capacities of AP1 proteins are detectable in both states ( Fig .
6C ) , perhaps this means that , comparable with the situation that is found at a growing number of cellular promoters ( 50 , 51 ) , the activity of 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 1808 OKADAIC ACID-SENSITIVE PHOSPHATASES REGULATE IL-2 EXPRESSION in vivo 2,5 He DMS S p- 2 fn < 1,5 o [ a » ) 'S a < a % & .

Determination of the in vivo occupancy of the IL-2 promoter in ELA cells .
In vivo methylated genomic DNA was isolated from EL4 cells cultured in medium ( Zane 2 , black bars ) , treated with okadaic acid ( Jane 3 , bars striped longitudinal ) , or stimulated with PMA/A23187 for 6 h in the absence ( lane 4 , bars striped diagonal ) or presence ( Zane 5 , cross-striped bars ) of okadaic acid .
Okadaic acid was added 30 min before stimulation .
The coding strand of the IL-2 promoter was footprinted from in vivo methylated DNA preparations ( Zanes 2-5 ) and in vitro methylated DNA from untreated ELA cells ( Zane 1 , bars shaded ) using the ligation-mediated PCR protocol .
The experiment is representative of three repetitions .
On the Zeft , nucleotide positions relative to the transcriptional start point are shown .
In the middle , hypersensitivities ( open arrows ) and protections ( filled arrows ) that have been reported to occur at the IL-2 promoter ( 36 ) as well as the corresponding binding transcription factors ( NF-AT , TGGGC , NF-KB , ATGG , AP-1 , NF-AT , OAP , Oct ) are marked .
Densitometric analysis of the autoradiogram is presented on the right-hand side .
Relative intensity values of the bands were determined , as described in Materials and Methods .
For graph representation , relative intensity values derived from in vivo methylated DNAs were normalized to that from in vitro methylated DNA , which was set 1 .
Densitometric analysis of the protected G *** and the hypersensitive G ** `` at the distal NF-AT site was impaired by the weak resolution on top of the gel .
the IL-2 promoter is regulated by its nucleosomal architecture as well .
In this case , T cell activation would induce the establishment or fixes ( in other T cells ) a promoter structure similar to the one in resting T cells that does not permit access of single transcription of an open form of IL-2 promoter packaging .
The inhibition of okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases during activation may either alter or disturb this process .
At present , it is not clear whether , and if so how , okadaic acid treatment induces ( in activated ELA cells ) factors ( 36 ) .
Alternatively , simultaneous cell activation and okadaic acid treatment may establish a new inhibitory form of IL-2 promoter packaging .
Taken together , the characteristic features of IL-2 transcription in ELA cells indicate that besides transcription 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology factor activity , changes of the chromatin structure are probably involved in the regulation of IL-2 expression in T cells .
The signaling pathway investigated in this study does not involve PP2B/calcineurin .
Thus , inhibition of okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases abrogated both the PP2B/calcineurin-depen-dent and independent pathways of IL-2 expression ( Fig .
5 ) .
The similarities of the effects of okadaic acid and the PP2B/calcineurin inhibitor CsA are , however , remarkable : loss of activator binding to the IL-2 promoter was also observed when cells were stimulated in the presence of CsA ( 36 ) .
CsA is known to block NFE-AT activation and , in addition , to exert inhibitory effects on Oct and NF- « B proteins ( 17 , 46 , 52 ) .
As shown in this study , okadaic acid also inhibits NF-AT , Oct , and NF-KB activities ( Fig .
64 ) .
One conclusion from these observations is to predict a convergence of the pathways depending on okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases and on PP2B/calcineurin .
Perhaps this occurs downstream of PP2B/calcineurin , since there is evidence that PP2B/ calcineurin may activate the type 1 Ser/Thr phosphatase PPI by inactivation of the PP1 inhibitor 1 ( 53 ) .
The dependency of IL-2 transcription on okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases is conserved during tumorigenic transformation and evolution , since the inhibitory effect of okadaic acid was observed in nontransformed primary human T cells as well as in malignant T cell lines from mice and humans .
This stresses the importance of these phosphatases for the regulation of IL-2 expression .
Future work should focus on the identification of the individual phosphatases and proteins targeted by them .
In this regard , the essential actin-binding protein pp19/cofilin has been identified as one of the substrates of okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases .
Dephosphoryla-tion and nuclear translocation of pp19/cofilin as a consequence of costimulatory signals correlate with the induction of IL-2 production ( 20 ) .
Whether effects of cofilin on the nucleoskeleton are involved in changes of the chromatin structure influencing transcriptional activation remains to be determined .
