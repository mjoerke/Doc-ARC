Microtubules Mediate Cellular 25-Hydroxyvitamin D ; , Trafficking and the Genomic Response to 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D ; in Normal Human Monocytes* ( Received for publication , April 21 , 1995 ) Shigehito Kamimura , Maurizio Gallieni , Min Zhong , Walter Eduardo Slatopolsky , and Adriana Dussof From the Department of Internal Medicine , Renal Division , and the { Department of Cell Biology and Physiology , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri 63110-1093 The genomic actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( 1,25 ( 0H ) ; D ; ) are mediated by the intracellular vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) .
Although immunocytochemistry has shown that disruption of microtubular assembly prevents nuclear access of the sterol-VDR complex , the role of microtubules in the response to 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; has not been studied in viable cells .
Our studies examined this interaction in normal human monocytes .
Monocytes convert 25 ( O0H ) D ; to 1,25 ( 0H ) ; D ; and to 24-hydroxylated metabolites more polar than 1,25 ( 0H ) , D , .
Microtubule disruption totally abolished the ability of exogenous 1,25 ( 0H ) , D , to suppress its own synthesis and to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA and activity , without affecting either total 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; uptake or maximal 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; -VDR binding .
Thus , intact microtubules are essential for 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D , -dependent modulation of gene transcription .
Interestingly , microtubule disruption also decreased monocyte 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; synthesis , not by decreasing the V , , , ... of monocyte mitochondrial 1 « -hydroxylase but through an increase in the K , , , for 25 ( OH ) D ; .
We examined 25 ( OH ) D ; transport .
Microtubule disruption did not affect total cellular 25 ( OH ) D , uptake but reduced its intracellular trafficking to the mitochondria .
Thus , microtubules participate in intracellular 25 ( OH ) D ; transport , and their integrity determines normal 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; , synthesis .
The most active metabolite of vitamin D , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) ) ,1 is a potent steroid hormone .
Similar to other steroids , its genomic actions require binding to its intracellular receptor and interaction of the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; -vita-min D receptor ( VDR ) complex with specific vitamin D responsive regions in the genome ( 1 , 2 ) .
It has been suggested recently that hormone-free glucocorticoid receptors are located predominantly in the cytoplasm , and , * This work was supported in part by United States Public Health Service NIDDK , National Institutes of Health Grants DK-09976 and DK-07126 .

after the addition of steroid , they are rapidly translocated to the nucleus ( 3-6 ) .
The transfer of glucocorticoid receptor into the nucleus involves translocation along microtubules as revealed by immunofluorescent studies ( 7 ) in a process that is driven by tubulin-associated dynein motors ( 8 ) .
In the case of vitamin D , there is some controversy as to whether apoVDRs reside only in the nucleus like the thyroid hormone receptor ( 9 ) or whether they can undergo ligand-de-pendent translocation like the glucocorticoid receptor ( 10 , 11 ) .
Using a recently developed fluorescent ligand , Barsony et al .
( 12 ) were able to demonstrate the cytoplasmic localization of the VDR in viable human skin fibroblasts , porcine kidney epithelial cells , human breast cancer cells , and rat osteosarcoma cells , supporting previous immunocytochemical findings in fixed human fibroblasts ( 13 ) and osteoblasts ( 14 ) .
Although immunocytology has shown that cytoplasmic VDR co-localizes with tubulin and that disruption of microtubular assembly blocks the translocation of the 1,25 ( O0H ) , D , -VDR complex into the nucleus ( 15 ) in microwave fixed fibroblasts , the role of microtubules on VDR transport in viable cells has never been evaluated .
We hypothesized that if this intracellular transport system is of physiological relevance , the genomic response to 1,25 ( 0H ) , D ; should be impaired with alterations in the structure or function of the microtubule network .
We tested this hypothesis in normal human monocytes .
Human monocytes express receptors for 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; that are indistinguishable from those described in classical 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; target tissues ( 16 ) , and the interactions of 1,25 ( 0H ) , D ; , with monocytes-macrophages have critical implications for the regulation of immune responses ( 17-20 ) .
Our laboratory has demonstrated that peripheral blood monocytes from normal individuals constitutively express 1a-hydroxylase , the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ; ( 25 ( OH ) D ; ) to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 21 ) .
We have also shown that when peripheral blood monocytes were exposed to physiological concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , La-hydroxylase activity is markedly suppressed .
In addition , exogenous 1,25 ( 0H ) ; , D ; promotes an induction of vitamin D catabolism by increasing 24-hydroxylase mRNA and activity ( 22 ) .
Because both effects of the sterol require at least 2 h of exposure to 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; ( 22 ) , it is likely that the inhibition of 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; production by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; also involves a genomic mechanism .
In the present studies , we used this human monocyte model to assess the physiological relevance of microtubule integrity in the response to 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; .
This report demonstrates for the first time that integrity of the microtubule network is critical for a normal genomic response to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and that an intracel- 28 .

1,25-Dihydroxy [ 26,27-methyl-*H ] cholecalcif-erol ( specific activity , 120-174 Ci/mmol ) and 25-hydroxy [ 26 ( 27 ) -methyl-*H Jcholecalciferol ( specific activity , 28 Ci/mmol ) were obtained from Amersham .
Colchicine , vinblastine , isocitrate , and NADPH were obtained from Sigma .
Culture of Human Monocytes-Peripheral blood was obtained from normal volunteers by venipuncture .
Mononuclear leukocytes were isolated using a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc. ) .
Cells were plated in six-well plates at a concentration of 7 X 10° to 10 `` cells per well in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 1 % fatty acid-free albumin , 50,000 units/liter penicillin G sodium , 50,000 pg/liter streptomycin sulfate , 10 mm HEPES , and 0.8 mM NaHCO , .
After an incubation period of 18 h at 37 °C , media and nonadherent cells were removed , and adherent cells were washed ( once with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and twice with 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 0.1 % fatty acid-free albumin ) .
More than 95 % of the adherent cells stained positively for macrophage-specific « -naphthyl acetate esterase activity ( 23 ) .
This adherent cell population was used in all studies .
The Effect of Exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) , D , on 1,25 ( OH ) ; D , Synthesis and 25 ( OH ) D , Catabolism by Monocytes-Adherent cells were incubated in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 1 % fatty-acid-free albumin ( incubation media ) and 0 or 0.24 nM 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D , ; for 4 h. Media were removed , and 1 ml of fresh incubation media ( 0.1 % albumin ) was added per well .
The synthesis of 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; and metabolites more polar than 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was initiated by adding 0.1 wCi of 25-hydroxy [ 26 ( 27 ) -methyl-*H ] chole-calciferol in 20 pl of media per well .
Reactions were stopped after a 1-h incubation at 37°C by the addition of 1 ml of acetonitrile ; 100 ng of radioinert 1,25 ( OH ) , D , were added to the wells to monitor recoveries .
Cells were scraped using a rubber policeman , and cells and media were collected .
Wells were washed with 2 ml of acetonitrile : water ( 1:1 ) , scraped , and pooled with the previously collected fraction .
Samples were vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 2,500 % g for 15 min .
Vitamin D metabolites were obtained from the supernatants using C ; & cartridges ( Fisher Scientific ) and the extraction procedure developed by Reinhardt et al .
( 24 ) .
The vitamin D metabolite fraction eluting with acetonitrile was collected , dried under nitrogen , and purified by HPLC using a Zorbax Sil column ( Phenomenex , Torrance , CA ) with 3 % iso-propyl alcohol in methylene chloride as solvent .
Average recoveries of radioinert 1,25 ( OH ) , D , were higher than 75 % .
Immediately after the elution of the D ; peak , the column was stripped with 4 ml of methanol to quantitate the synthesis of metabolites more polar than 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; ( polar metabolites ) .
Tritium eluting in the 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; and more polar metabolite HPLC fractions was counted in a liquid scintillation counter ( ICN Micromedic System Inc. , Huntsville , AL ) .
Radioactivity eluting with the methanol strip from wells incubated with media only was considered as nonspecific oxidation of 25 ( OH ) D ; and subtracted as background .
Results were normalized per pg of DNA measured using the ethidium bromide method ( 25 ) .
In each experiment , determinations were performed in triplicate .
The Effect of Microtubule Disrupting Agents on the Suppression of 1,25 ( 0H ) , D , Synthesis and the Stimulation of Vitamin D Catabolism by Exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) ; D , in Monocytes-Positive controls were adherent cells exposed for 4 h to 0 or 0.24 nM 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; .

In the Post group , adherent cells were first incubated with 0 or 0.24 nM 1,25 ( OH ) , D , and then exposed to colchicine for 30 min .
The effect of the reversible microtubule disrupting agent , nocodazole , on the response to 1,25 ( O0H ) , D , was examined as follows .
Adherent monocytes were treated with 0 or 10 um nocodazole for 30 min before a co-incubation with 0.24 nw 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and 10 uM nocodazole for 4 h. To test reversibility of the effect of nocodazole , adherent cells were exposed to 0 or 10 pM nocodazole ( dissolved in 1 Ll of dimethyl sulfox-ide ) for 4 % h ; cells were then washed , and the media were replaced by fresh nocodazole-free incubation media .
Monocytes were allowed to recover for 4 h. Control and nocodazole-treated monocytes were then exposed to 0.24 nM 1,25 ( OH ) , D , for 4 h. In each independent experiment , the synthesis of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and of polar metabolites by monocytes from the same individual was measured 22161 in triplicate , and the steady state 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels were quantified in duplicate using a ribonuclease protection assay .

RESULTS Effect of Microtubule Disruption on the Response of Normal Human Monocytes to 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; -We examined the effect of disruption of microtubular assembly on the ability of 1,25 ( O0H ) , ; D ; to suppress its own production and to induce vitamin D catabolism .
Fig .

At a concentration of colchicine of 25 um , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was no longer able to suppress monocyte 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production .
The number of monocytes that stained positive for polymerized tubulin decreased from 91 % in control preparations to 62 , 22 , and 9 % after a 30-min exposure to concentrations of colchicine of 10 , 25 , and 750 um , respectively .

Dose-dependent effect of colchicine on the suppression of 1,25 ( 0H ) , D , synthesis by exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) , D , .
Adherent cells were incubated in serum-free media with doses of colchicine from 0 to 750 px for 30 min .
Media were removed , and cells were washed and incubated with 0 ( vehicle ) or 0.24 nm 1,25 ( OH ) , D , ; for 4 h. Synthesis of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , was measured as outlined under `` Experimental Procedures . ``

of five independent experiments performed in triplicate ( * , differs from control , p = 0.05 ) .
Because colchicine alone caused a dose-dependent reduction of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , production by monocytes , we performed the experiments summarized in Fig .
2 to define the effects of microtubule disruption in the response of monocytes to 1,25 ( 0H ) , D ; .
The lowest ( 25 um ) and highest ( 750 um ) doses of colchicine , effective in blocking the ability of 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; to suppress its own production , were used to examine the effect of microtubule disruption on the ability of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to suppress its own synthesis ( upper panel ) and to induce vitamin D catabolism ( generation of 24-hydroxylated metabolites more polar than 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; ( polar metabolites ) ; lower panel ) .
In monocytes with intact microtubules ( Controls ) , exposure to 0.24 nw 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; for 4 h reduced 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; synthesis to 55.2 + 1.3 % and increased the generation of polar metabolites 7-fold above vehicle controls , respectively .
However , when monocytes were treated with 25 or 750 um colchicine for 30 min before exposure to 0 ( vehicle ) or 0.24 nm 1,25 ( O0H ) ; , D ; for 4 h ( Fig .
2 , Pre ) exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; could no longer reduce 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; , synthesis nor enhance the production of polar metabolites .
As mentioned for the dose response to colchicine , in monocytes exposed to colchicine alone ( vehicle ) , there was a marked reduction of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; synthesis .
To assess whether the lack of response to 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; with colchicine treatment was the result of a direct effect of colchicine on monocyte hydroxylases rather than the consequence of a defective access of the 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -VDR complex to the nu-cleus , monocytes were first incubated with 0 ( vehicle ) or 0.24 nm 1,25 ( 0H ) , D ; for 4 h and then exposed to colchicine for 30 min .
Measurements of synthesis of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and polar metabolites ( Fig .
2 , Post ) show , in vehicle controls , a similar decrease in la-hydroxylase as described in Pre experiments with no significant changes in the apparent activity of the hydroxylases involved in vitamin D catabolism .
However , in these protocols , microtubule disruption occurred after the 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -VDR complex had interacted with the genome , and , despite the reduction in l1a-hydroxylase activity in vehicle control monocytes , exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; could reduce its own synthesis and increase vitamin D catabolism with a potency similar to that observed in monocytes with intact micro-tubules .
Specifically , a 54.2 + 3.1 % reduction of 1,25 ( O0H ) ; , D ; synthesis and 743.2 + 24.1 % induction of vitamin D catabolism by 0.24 nw 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , was observed in the presence of 25 um 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Role of Microtubules in Vitamin D Transport and Action p < 0.01 [ : ] Vehicle EW 1,25 ( 0M ) ; 0 ; 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; synthesis ( fmal / jg DNA h ) Control Pre Post __ , Pre Post 25 pM 750 pM Colchicine 3 8 Syntheals of polar metabolites ( fmal / pg DNA - h ) B Colchicine Fic .

These results demonstrate that microtubular integrity is required for monocytes to respond to 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; .
Further support for these findings came from measurements of steady state levels of 24-hydroxylase mRNA using a ribonuclease protection assay .
Fig .
3 shows that intact monocytes responded to physiological concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , with a marked induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA .
However , pretreatment of monocytes with colchicine impaired the ability of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to induce 24-hydroxylase gene transcription in a dose-dependent manner .
A partial reduction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels was achieved with 10 um colchicine and , similar to the increase in the synthesis of polar metabolites , 25 ux colchicine caused total inhibition of the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; -mediated increase in 24-hydroxylase mRNA .
When the 30-min treatment with colchicine ( 10 , 25 , and 750 um ) followed the 4-h exposure to 0.24 nm 1,25 ( 0H ) ; , D ; , the increase in 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels was identical with that observed in monocytes exposed to 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; alone .
This suggests that a 30-min exposure to colchicine has no significant direct effect either in mRNA stability or in 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -mediated transcription .
To confirm that the effects of colchicine on the genomic action of 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; in monocytes were mediated by microtubule disruption only , we performed similar experiments with nocodazole , a reversible microtubule disrupting agent .

that the inability of 1,25 ( 0H ) , D ; , to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels when microtubules are disrupted with 10 uM nocodazole ( 74 % of nocodazole-treated monocytes stained negatively for polymerized tubulin ) can be totally reversed if monocytes are allowed to recover microtubular integrity after removal of nocodazole from the incubation media .

Colchicine did not affect total cellular uptake of 1,25 ( 0H ) , D ; after a 1-h incubation either at 4 °C ( C : 1.5 + 0.2 ; T : 1.6 + 0.2 fmol/ug of DNW/h ; n = 3 ) or at 37°C ( 3.0 + 0.3 versus 3.5 + 0.2 ; n = 4 ) .
We next examined whether colchicine affected the formation of the 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -VDR complex .
In three independent experiments performed in triplicate , there was no significant difference in maximal specific binding of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to the VDR between untreated and colchicine-treated ( 750 um ) monocytes ( C : 0.21 + 0.02 ; T : 0.19 + 0.01 fmol/ug of DNA , n = 3 ) .

Fig .

If after microtubule disruption , nocodazole was removed from the incubation media and monocytes were allowed to recover microtubular assembly , la-hydroxylase activity returned to basal values , which supports the fact that microtubular integrity is necessary for normal 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; synthesis by human monocytes .

Effect of nocodazole on monocyte la-hydroxylase activity .
Monocytes were incubated with 0 or 10 uM nocodazole for 30 min , and la-hydroxylase activity was measured as outlined under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
To examine the reversibility of nocodazole effects on 1,25 ( OH ) , D , production ( reversed ) , after the 30-min exposure to 0 or 10 uM nocodazole , nocodazole was removed and monocytes were allowed to recover microtubular assembly for 4 h before assaying 1a-hydroxylase activity .
techniques were employed , and the purity of the fractions was assessed using specific markers as shown in Table II .
Table III shows that in monocytes with intact microtubules , most of the 25 ( OH ) D ; , within the cell was associated with the mitochondrial fraction .
Colchicine treatment reduced the uptake of 25 ( OH ) D ; by the mitochondrial fraction with a concomitant increase in the amount of 25 ( OH ) D ; in the cytosol and with no changes in the 25 ( OH ) D ; associated to microsomal or nuclear fractions .
To test whether this reduction in the mitochondrial uptake of 25 ( OH ) D ; could be the result of a decrease in the number of mitochondria with microtubule disruption , we measured succinate dehydrogenase activity in the mitochondrial fraction of untreated and colchicine-treated monocytes .
We found no changes in succinate dehydrogenase activity ( C : 0.022 + 0.002 ; T : 0.020 + 0.002 umol/min/ug of DNA , n = 2 ) with colchicine treatment .
Subcellular Localization of Monocyte 1 « -Hydroxylase-The previous findings also suggested the mitochondrial localization of monocyte 1la-hydroxylase .
Therefore , we measured 1a-hy-droxylase activity in mitochondrial and microsomal fractions .
In mitochondria , 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; production was 0.68 + 0.07 fmol/ug of DNW/h , whereas in microsomes , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; synthesis was undetectable ( 0.01 + 0.01 fmol/ug of DNA/h ) .

Clearly , monocyte la-hydroxylase , like the renal enzyme , is located exclusively in mitochondria .
To determine whether the reduction of 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; production by colchicine involved reduced 25 ( OH ) D ; transport to the mitochondria or directly impaired mitochondrial 25 ( OH ) D ; up-take , we measured 1 « -hydroxylase activity in ( a ) mitochondrial fractions isolated from intact and colchicine-treated monocytes and ( b ) in isolated mitochondrial fractions from intact monocytes in the presence of 0 or 10 um colchicine .
In both protocols , we found no effect of colchicine on mitochondrial 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; production ( ( a ) control : 0.65 + 0.12 fmol/ug of DNA/h ; colchicine : 0.63 + 0.09 , n = 2 ; ( b ) control : 0.68 + 0.07 ; colchicine : 0.63 + 0.08 fmol of 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; /ug of DNW/h ) .
DISCUSSION 1,25 ( 0H ) ; D ; , the most active form of vitamin D , is a potent steroid hormone .
Its actions extend beyond calcium homeosta-sis to impact a variety of nonclassical targets including the immune system .
To elicit a biological response , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; binds to its intracellular receptor and translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with vitamin D responsive elements in the genome ( 1 , 2 ) .
A tubulin-mediated cytoplasm to nucleus transport system has been demonstrated using immunocytochemistry in human fibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells ( 13-15 ) ; however , the physiological relevance of this transport system in the response to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; has not been examined either in normal or pathological states .
In the present studies , we used our human monocyte model to define the physiological role of microtubules on the response to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
We found that disruption of microtubule integrity totally blocked the ability of exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to suppress 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production and to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA and activity in normal human monocytes .
The lack of response to exogenous 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; with microtubular disruption could not be attributed to a reduced uptake of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , by monocytes or to a defective formation of the VDR-1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; complex .
Clearly , microtubular integrity is required after the formation of the 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , -VDR complex for monocytes to elicit a normal 22165 response to 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; .
In addition , our studies could not demonstrate any direct action of microtubule disrupting agents on both genomic effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
The ability of exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to suppress monocyte 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production and to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA and activity was not affected when the microtubule disrupting agent was added after exposure to the sterol for 4 h. These results in viable human monocytes support previous reports in fixed cells ( 13 , 14 ) of cytoplasmic VDR localization .
In contrast to gene activation by the glucocorticoid receptor ( 31 ) , microtubule integrity is mandatory for 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -VDR-mediated modulation of the transcription of vitamin D responsive genes .
In addition to our findings in vitro , the recent clinical demonstration of a phenotype of vitamin D-resistant rickets type 1 , caused by a defective nuclear translocation of an otherwise normal VDR ( 32 ) , emphasizes the critical role of the tubulin transport system mediating cytoplasmic to nuclear VDR-1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; translocation in 1,25 ( 0H ) ; , D ; action .
The present studies also demonstrated that disruption of microtubular integrity significantly decreased the ability of human monocytes to synthesize 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Since colchicine was reported to decrease protein synthesis ( 30 ) , we examined whether this reduction in 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; generation was mediated by a decreased expression of monocyte la-hydroxylase .
Kinetic analysis demonstrated that disruption of microtubular assembly did not affect the V , , , , , of the enzyme but markedly reduced its apparent affinity for its substrate , 25 ( 0H ) D ; .
Further characterization of the mechanisms mediating this increase in the K , , , for 25 ( OH ) D ; showed that microtubule disruption did not affect whole cell uptake of 25 ( OH ) D ; , but markedly decreased its intracellular delivery to the mitochondria , suggesting a role for microtubules in intracellular 25 ( OH ) D ; transport .
We have also demonstrated that the reduction in mitochondrial 25 ( OH ) D ; uptake could not be attributed to a reduction in the number of mitochondria since succinate dehydrogenase activity was not decreased in colchicine-treated monocytes .
The observation that la-hydroxylase activity in isolated mitochondria was not affected by a dose of colchicine that effectively reduced 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; production by intact monocytes indicates no direct effect of colchicine on mitochondrial 25 ( OH ) D ; uptake or enzymatic activity .
Thus , contrary to the well accepted theory of simple diffusion of 25 ( OH ) D ; due to its lipophilic nature , microtubules participate in the intracellular transport of 25 ( OH ) D ; to the mitochondrial la-hydroxylase of human monocytes .
Similarly , cytoskeletal components were shown to mediate the transport of adrenal steroid precursors to the mitochondria , thus limiting the rate of synthesis of adrenal steroids ( 33 ) .
A mitochondrial localization of monocyte 1 « -hydroxylase was also demonstrated in the chick myelomonocytic cell line HD11 ( 27 ) , and the kinetics of the avian enzyme has marked similarities with the la-hydroxylase expressed in human pulmonary alveolar macrophages in sar-coidosis ( 34 , 35 ) .
Similar to our finding of impaired 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; synthesis by monocytes with microtubular disruption , reduction in 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; production by vinblastine was demonstrated in renal tubules from vitamin D-deficient chicks ( 36 ) .
However , for the avian renal enzyme , there was no actual reduction in total 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; synthesized but an impaired exit of the sterol from the mitochondria and out of the renal epithelial cells .
On the contrary , in our human monocyte model , we measured the total 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , generated regardless of its subcellular or extracellular location , and we found a marked decrease in 1,25 ( O0H ) ; , D ; levels with microtubule disruption with no alteration in the V. , , , , of the enzyme .
Therefore , despite the similarities in subcellular localization and regulation of the la 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 22166 hydroxylase of human monocytes , it is clear that the effects of microtubular disruption on the intracellular transport of vitamin D metabolites vary with cell type , species , and vitamin D status .
If the cytoskeletal abnormalities reported for platelets in chronic uremia ( 37 ) are present in other cell types such as renal epithelia or peripheral monocytes , it is likely that a defective intracellular 25 ( OH ) D ; transport may partially explain the need for supraphysiological concentrations of 25 ( OH ) D ; to correct renal ( 38 , 39 ) and extrarenal ( 40 , 41 ) 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; production in chronic renal failure .
Our finding of a higher K , , , for 25 ( OH ) D ; in the 1 « -hydroxylase of monocytes from hemodial-ysis patients ( 42 ) seems to support this hypothesis .
These cytoskeletal abnormalities may also affect the translocation of the 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; -VDR complex causing the abnormal response to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; of chronic renal failure .
In summary , in normal monocytes , microtubules mediate intracellular transport of 25 ( OH ) D ; to the mitochondria and the translocation of the 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -receptor complex to the nucleus .
Disruption of microtubular integrity markedly impaired 1,25 ( O0H ) , D ; synthesis by the mitochondrial 1 « -hydroxylase and totally blocked the ability of monocytes to respond to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; which clearly indicate the physiological and/or pathophysiological relevance of the tubulin-transport system in humans .
