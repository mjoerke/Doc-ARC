We demonstrate here that the expression of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM ; E.C .
3.1.4.12 ) is induced during this process and is strongly elevated in differentiated THP-1 cells , as well as in differentiated human mononuclear phagocytes .
Using Northern blotting , RNase protection assay , and nuclear run-on analyses , we show that the up-regulation of ASM expression is regulated mainly at the level of transcription and that new protein synthesis is required for enhanced ASM activity .
This cell-type specific induction by PMA treatment was further investigated with respect to transcriptional control .
A series of 5 ' deletion derivatives of the upstream regulatory region were used in transient transfection assays to identify promoter elements required for basal and inducible gene expression .
A PMA responsive element was localized to a region between -319 and -219 bp upstream of the initiation codon and co-trans-fections with transcription factor expression plasmids for AP-2 and Sp1 resulted in augmented ASM promoter activity , which was abolished when the binding sites for these two factors were deleted .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays we demonstrate that this region is specifically bound by Spl and AP-2 .
These factors are present in nuclear extracts prepared from both induced and uninduced THP-1 cells .
However , the intensity of the complex formed appeared to increase when nuclear extracts from PMAtreated cells were used.8§ From these studies , we conclude that a concerted action of the transcription factors AP-2 and Sp1 is essential for the up-regulation of ASM expression during the process of macrophage differentia-tion.-Langmann , T. , C.

Supplementary key words - acid sphingomyelinase » gene regulation ® monocyte « macrophage « differentiation « ASM-promoter « transcription factors 870 Journal of Lipid Research Volume 40 , 1999 Human acid sphingomyelinase is a lysosomal hydrolase required for the cleavage of sphingomyelin to phospho-choline and ceramide ( 1 ) .
The enzyme with a pH optimum of 4.5 and a molecular mass of 72 kDa was purified from human urine by Quintern et al .
( 2 ) .
ASM deficiency has been shown to be responsible for the autosomal recessive sphingomyelin storage disorders Niemann-Pick disease type A ( NPD-A ) and type B ( NPD-B ) .
These two forms are distinguished by well-defined clinical symptoms .
NPD-A patients show severe neurodegenerative lesions and die within the first 2 years of life , while in NPD-B patients who have a prolonged lifespan beyond middle age , only the organs of the reticuloendothelial system are affected and minimal neurologic in volvement occurs ( 3 , 4 ) .
A valuable animal model for NPD-A has been generated recently ( 5 , 6 ) , with a phenotype similar to the human disease that is currently used for the evaluation of various therapeutic regimens .
Beyond its catalytic lysosomal function , ASM is discussed to contribute in cytokine signalling pathways by releasing ceramide , as a second messenger from sphingomyelin ( 7-10 ) .
Three distinct ASM transcripts resulting from alternative splicing were isolated and expressed in COS-1 cells , demonstrating that only the full-length mRNA form encoded a catalytically active enzyme ( 11 ) .
The gene is 5kb in length , consists of six exons , and maps to chromosome 11p15.1-11p15.4 ( 12 , 13 ) .
The putative promoter region has been cloned , however , no detailed characterization of promoter elements has been reported so far ( 14 ) .

6loz ' o ) Aepy uo qsanB Aq Buo'jj [ 'mmm wou ; papeojumog ASBMB JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH ASM obviously plays a major role in phagocytic tissue macrophages as is reflected by the presence of a large lysosomal compartement for intracellular digestive pro-cesses .
Recently , it has been shown that ASM can be secreted by various cell types , including macrophages ( 15 ) , hydrolyze atherogenic lipoproteins , and play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions ( 16 , 17 ) .
However , no data on the ASM expression in monocytic development are currently available .
Therefore we became interested in the regulation of ASM during monocyte to macrophage maturation and in the more immature monocytic cell line THP-1 .
This cell line is considered as an excellent , legitimate in vitro model system for the analysis of processes related to monocytic differentiation due to its simple conversion to mature macrophages upon phorbol ester stimulation in cell culture ( 18 ) .
The present study demonstrates that monocytic differentiation induces ASM mRNA expression mainly at the level of transcription .
Furthermore , we identified DNA sequence elements and their corresponding transcription factors that are required for the PMA-mediated induction of the ASM promoter in THP-1 cells .
In order to determine the cis-elements necessary for basal and differentiation induced promoter activity , we used 5 ' truncations and mutagenized fragments of the ASM gene fused to a luciferase reporter gene .
With these constructs we were able to define PMA-responsive elements .
Binding of transcription factors to specific promoter sites has been demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNaseI footprinting experiments .
Our studies clearly demonstrate the engagement of the transcription factors Spl and AP-2 in the transcriptional induction of the acid sphingomyelinase gene observed during monocyte to macrophage differentiation .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Isolation and culture of cells Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by leukapheresis and counterflow elutriation ( 19 ) .
To obtain fractions containing > 90 % CD14 positive mononuclear phagocytes , cells were pooled and cultured on plastic Petri dishes in macrophage SFM medium ( Gibco BRL ) containing 25 U/ml recombinant human M-CSE THP-1 cells ( 20 ) were obtained from ATCC , cultured in RPMI 1640 medium ( Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Gibco BRL ) , 100 U penicillin per ml , 100 ug of streptomycin per ml , and incubated in 10 % CO ; in air at 37°C .

RESULTS Changes in ASM mRNA expression associated with monocytic differentiation Northern analysis was used to quantitate the relative amounts of ASM mRNA in THP-1 cells at different time points after PMA treatment , in monocytes and in monocyte-derived macrophages ( Fig .
1 ) .
In undifferentiated THP-1 cells ( Fig .
1 , lane 1 ) no measureable amount of ASM mRNA was present .
Steady-state levels of the ASM message increased successively after PMA-induced differentiation , reaching maximum levels after 24 h ( Fig .
1 , lanes 2-6 ) .
To compare these results from the THP-1 cell line with results from human blood monocytes , ASM mRNA abundance in total RNA from human peripheral blood monocytes ( Mo ) and from monocyte-derived macrophages after 7 days in culture ( 7dMNP ) were analyzed .
mRNA levels for ASM similarly increased during the differentiation process of native monocytes ( Fig .

ASM mRNA is induced during monocyte to macrophage differentiation .
Total RNAs were isolated from THP-1 cells cultured in the presence of PMA for 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 h , from freshly isolated monocytes ( Mo ) and from monocyte-derived macrophages ( 7dMNP ) .
Each lane was loaded with 10 pg of total RNA .
The blot was hybridized with the P-labeled ASM cDNA fragment P3/ P4 .
The lower panel displays the hybridization analysis of the same blot performed with a human B-actin probe as control .
8 ) .
To confirm these results on the level of protein expres-sion , immunoblots were carried out and were found to produce similar results ( data not shown ) .
Expression of type 1 and type 2 ASM transcripts in differentiating THP cells RNase protection analysis was performed to determine the relative levels of type 1 and type 2 ASM transcripts in total RNA of THP -1 cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
Hybridization of the 333bp antisense probe ( 12 ) with the ASM mRNA resulted in two protected fragments of 333bp and 266 bp , originating from the type 1 and type 2 ASM transcripts , respectively .
The expression of both transcripts was up-regulated during the monocytic differentiation process ( Fig .
2A ) , with type 2 transcripts representing only a minor part of the ASM message .
Measurement of ASM transcription rate during PMA-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells In order to elucidate whether the up-regulation of the steady-state level of ASM mRNA was due to changes in the rate of transcription or post-transcriptional mechanisms , nuclear run-on analysis was carried out using nuclei isolated either from undifferentiated cells or cells treated with PMA for 24 h. Radiolabeled transcripts were allowed to hybridize to cDNA probes for ASM , scavenger receptor type A ( SR-A ) , and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) or the insertless pUC18 cloning vector on nylon membranes ( Fig .
2B ) .
The transcriptional induction of scavenger receptor type A after stimulation of THP-1 cells by PMA is well characterized and was thus used as positive control ( 29 , 30 ) .
Our experiments clearly demonstrate that the increase of ASM mRNA amount during monocytic differentiation was largely at the level of transcription .
The transcription rate of the GAPDH gene was up-regulated to a much lesser extent than that of the ASM gene after PMA induction of THP-1 cells , and hybridization to the pUC18 vector produced no signal ( data not shown ) .

( A ) RNase protection analysis of ASM transcripts in differentiating THP-1 cells .
The 333 bp antisense RNA probe was designed to discriminate between type 1 and type 2 ASM transcripts .
The protected fragments for type 1 and type 2 transcripts were 333 bp and 266 bp in length , respectively .
Lanes 1-5 contain RNA from THP-1 cells incubated with PMA for the indicated times ; lane t , mock control with tRNA ; lane P , free probe .
The arrows indicate the positions of type 1 and type 2 protected fragments .
( B ) Induction of ASM mRNA depends on new transcription .
Nuclei were isolated from control cells ( -PMA ) and cells treated with PMA for 24 h ( +PMA ) .
Nascent transcripts were labeled with [ a22P ] UTP and hybridized to cDNA probes for scavenger receptor type A ( SR-A ) , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , and ASM cDNA fragment P3/ P4 bound to nylon membranes .
actinomycin D and PMA did not result in enhanced ASM mRNA levels , suggesting that ASM mRNA stability is not prolonged ( data not shown ) .
5'-Deletional analysis of the ASM promoter To identify sequences important for promoter activity , human genomic clones containing the ASM gene were isolated by screening a PAC library with a probe encompassing nt -203 to +44 of the ASM gene .
Five promoter constructs with successive 5 ' truncations were generated by PCR using the isolated PAC clones as template .
As shown in Fig .
3A , the deletions ranged from -519 bp to -119 bp proximal to the initiation codon .
Two minor transcription start sites at nt -251 and nt -117 and one major transcription start site at nt -160 have been identified using primer extension analysis by Newrzella and Stoffel ( 14 ) .
The promoter activities of the constructs are shown in Fig .
3B .
The promoterless pGL3basic vector served as negative control and displayed no promoter activity .
By and large , the following results are evident from Langmann e al .

( A ) ASM promoter region with putative regulatory elements .
Putative cis-acting consensus sequences are denoted by boxes and numbers identify their positions as the distance to the ASM start codon .
The major transcription start site is indicated by an arrow .
The extent of the 5'truncations of the ASM promoter is shown .
The promoter fragments were ligated to the luciferase reporter gene in the for ward orienta-tion .
( B ) ASM promoter activity lies within the first 319 bp of the 5'-UTR .
THP-1 cells were transfected with 10 wg of each reporter gene construct , or the promoterless pGL3basic vector and 2 wg of pSVB-gal plasmid and cultured for 46 h in the presence or absence of PMA ( 160 nm ) , at which time cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity .
Assays were performed in triplicate and results shown are normalized to the B-galactosidase expression .
The results are representative of five independent experiments .
Black bars show basal ( uninduced ) activity of each promoter construct and grey bars indicate PMA-induced levels of activity .
these experiments . )
Similar basal promoter activities in THP-1 cells can be detected with constructs p ( -519/ +112 ) Luc , p ( -419/ +112 ) Luc , and p ( -319/ +112 ) Luc .
2 ) The shorter promoter fragments p ( -219/ +112 ) Luc and p ( -119/ +112 ) Luc show a significant decrease of basal promoter activity ( Fig .
3 , solid bars ) .
3 ) In transfected THP-1 cells incubated in the presence of PMA , luciferase activity increased between 2.7- and 3.6 -fold in each of the constructs analyzed , except for the two shortest fragments ( Fig .
3B , grey bars ) .
These promoter activities correlate well with the enhanced transcription found in the nuclear run 874 Journal of Lipid Research Volume 40 , 1999 on analysis ( see Fig .
2B ) .
Therefore , it is assumed that the response elements for PMA inducibility are located within -319 bp and -219 bp .
However , the presence of additional upstream enhancer elements can not be ruled out .
Sp1 and AP -2 transactivate the ASM promoter Within the DNA sequence upstream of the ASM gene transcription start site , several putative cis-acting consensus sequences are present ( Fig .
3A ) .
These include binding sites for transcription factors c-Myc , CREBP , AP-2 , Sp1 , and PU.1 ( 31-35 ) .
As shown in the deletion analysis ( Fig .
6loz ' o ) Aepy uo qsanB Aq Buo'jj [ 'mmm wou ; papeojumog ASBMB JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH 3B ) , construct p ( -219/ +112 ) Luc , which contains only the two PU.1 binding sites , shows no basal or PMAinduc-ible promoter activity .
This indicates that PU.1 alone may not play a significant role in ASM gene expression .
To further investigate the role of other transcription factors , we co-transfected THP -1 cells with the longest construct p ( -519/ +112 ) Luc and expression vectors for Myc ( pCMV Myc ) , AP-2a ( pCMVAP2a ) , Spl ( pPacSp1 ) , and BTEB ( pCMVBTEB ) , respectively ( Fig .
4A ) .
Expression of Spl and AP-2 caused constitutive augmentation of ASM promoter activity ( 1.8-fold , and 2.6 -fold , respectively ) , which could be further enhanced by the combination of Spl and AP-2 ( 3.2-fold ) .
c-Myc lowered luciferase expression ( 0.7-fold ) and cotransfection of BTEB , an Spl-4elated transcription factor , did not affect ASM promoter activity .
To determine the importance of the Spl site at -279 and the AP-2 site at -289 for the induction of the ASM promoter activity , luciferase constructs with mutated binding sites were transfected in THP-1 cells .
As shown in Fig .
4B , mutation of the Spl site , the AP-2 site , or both significantly reduced basal and inducible promoter activity ; however , it did not entirely abolish activity .
These data indicate that Spl and AP2 A 220000 200000 180000 160000 | 140000 120000 100000 80000 60000 j 40000 - I 20000 I o pCMV Sp1 AP-2 Myc - BETEB Sp1+ AP-2 relative light units are relevant and necessary for the transcriptional activity of the ASM promoter and that c-Myc may function as a negative regulator .
Characterization of proteins that bind to the ASM promoter To identify nuclear proteins that interact with the ASM promoter region , electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were performed .
The studies focused on three regions , SIF 3 , SIF 4 , and SIF 6 , including binding sites for the transcription factors Spl and AP-2 , which were shown to induce ASM promoter activity in co-transfection experiments ( see Fig .
4 ) .
SIF 3 ( -310/ -270 ) , which contains overlapping binding sites for AP-2 and Spl interacts with proteins in both control and induced nuclear extracts ( Fig .
5 , lanes 2 and 8 ) .
However , complexes appeared to be more intense when PMA-induced extracts were used .

Antibody supershift assays were performed with SIF3 to further characterize the transcription factors specifically interacting with this region .
As shown in Fig .

Additional evidence for the binding of Sp1 and AP-2 comes from binding studies with purified transcription factors ( Fig .
5 , lanes 14 and 15 ) and from EMSAs using oligonucleotide SIF 3 MI which contains a mutant AP-2/ Sp1 binding site ( Fig .
6 ) .
No specific retardation bands are produced with SIF 3 MI and THP-1 nuclear extracts ( Fig .
6 , lanes 4 and 5 ) , indicating that the mutant nucleotides are necessary for binding of Spl and AP-2 .
These experiments clearly demonstrate an inducible AP2 and Spl binding activity in THP-1 cells treated with PMA .
To examine whether the additional consensus binding sites in the ASM promoter are functional , EMSAs with SIF 4 ( -269/ -229 ) and SIF 6 ( -199/ -149 ) were performed .
SIF 4 contains two adjacent Spl binding sites and SIF 6 includes two neighbouring PU.1 and one Spl consensus se-quence .
Similar to SIF 3 , nuclear extracts from induced THP cells exhibited strong binding activity compared to uninduced extracts ( Fig .

DNaseI footprint analysis of the ASM promoter In order to demonstrate the binding of Spl to the promoter region spanning from nt -368 to nt -252 , inde-pendently , DNaseI footprinting experiments were carried out .
The promoter fragment was labeled at one end and either incubated with purified Spl protein obtained from a commercial source or HeLa nuclear extracts .
As can be seen in Fig .
8 , a convincing DNaselI protected region is detectable that colocalizes with the Spl binding site ( GC-box ) present in EMSA-fragment SIF 3 .
This site conforms well to the weight matrix analysis prediction of Bucher ( 36 ) for GC-boxes .
Expression of Sp1 protein is enhanced in PMA-stimulated THP cells We have found that Spl protein binds to the ASM promoter in differentiated THP cells to a much higher extent than in undifferentiated THP-1 cells .
To determine the na ture of the mechanisms in volved , we determined the levels of Sp1 , c-Jun , and PU.1 proteins in nuclear extracts from both cell types .
As shown in Fig .
9 , the early response gene c-Jun is induced in PMAtreated THP-1 cells , whereas PU.1 levels are equal in both extracts .
This is in accordance with the inducibility of c-Jun by PMA and the lack of change of PU.1 protein amount during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages .
The content of Spl protein in PMAtreated THP-1 cells was much greater than in uninduced THP-1 cells , in which Sp1 is nearly absent .
This new finding may indicate that ASM induction in THP-1 cells is partially mediated by an increased synthesis of Spl and its binding to the promoter in a differentiation dependent manner .
DISCUSSION This study demonstrates that acid sphingomyelinase mRNA is induced in both the human monocytic leukemia Langmann e al .

Nuclear run-on analysis of ASM expression ( Fig .
2B ) reveals that this up-regulation occurs mainly at the level of transcription .
Experiments with actinomycin D provided evidence that ASM mRNA stability is not modulated during the monocytic differentiation process .
ASM is expressed ubiquitously , but transcriptional induction is observed only in myelomonocytic cell lines such as U937 , and THP- , which have the ability to differentiate into macrophage-like cells upon PMA treatment , and in differentiating human peripheral blood monocytes .
These results suggest that the 878 Journal of Lipid Research Volume 40 , 1999 Taipa ( BP +PMA 39 kDa exammem | C-JUIN 45 kDa| @ tamp > -mmm® | P| ] { 95 kDa | ° Sp1 Fig .

Expression of Spl protein is induced in nuclear extracts from differentiated THP-1 cells .
20 pg of nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells or THP-1 cells treated with PMA for 24 hours were laid on the gel .
After blotting , c-Jun , PU.1 or Sp1 protein was detected by incubation with a specific polyclonal antibody .
A representative autoradiogram is shown .
increased ASM activity may reflect a characteristic function of mature macrophages , namely , phagocytosis of senescent cells and other particles and subsequent degradation of sphingomyelin derived from the internalized material .
This provided the rationale for investigation of the regulation of ASM expression by analyzing as-regulatory elements in the ASM promoter and the corresponding transcription fac-tors .
We studied the activity of five ASM promoter constructs by ligating them in front of the firefly luciferase reporter gene and used a transient transfection system in the THP -1 cell line .
Promoter fragments p ( -519/ +112 ) Luc , p ( -419/ +112 ) Luc , and p ( -319/ +112 ) Luc exhibited basal and PMA-induced luciferase activity ; however , all activity , including PMA-induced activity was lost using the shorter promoter fragments p ( -219/ +112 ) Luec and p ( -119/ +112 ) Luc .
Thus , a promoter region that confers PMA-mediated transactivation of the ASM gene was identified .
This GC-rich DNA sequence contains multiple transcription factor binding sites , including two adjacent binding sites for the transcription factors Spl and AP-2 .
These two factors are necessary for the basal and PMA-induced activation of the ASM promoter as demonstrated by transactivation studies and site-directed mutagenesis .
This region was subsequently analyzed in EMSAs and DNaselI footprinting experiments .
These analyses revealed a specific complex formation with Spl and AP-2 that is largely enhanced in nuclear extracts from differentiated THP-1 cells .
The ASM proximal promoter is GC-rich and lacks a TATA sequence motif .
In the absence of a TATA box , mechanisms other than direct recruitment of TBPs have been implicated in initiating the basal transcription complex .
Sp 1 transcription factors have been shown to be important constituents for correct transcription initiation from TATAess promoters ( 37-39 ) .
Although Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed , recent evidence suggests that Spl expression ( 40 ) , binding affinity ( 41 ) , and post-transcriptional modifications ( 42 , 43 ) may be modulated to confer tissue-specific and developmental regulation on target genes ( 44 ) .
Spl expression varies greatly among tissues , 6loz ' o ) Aepy uo qsanB Aq Buo'jj [ 'mmm wou ; papeojumog ASBMB JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH with hematopoetic cells containing very high levels of Spl mRNA and protein ( 40 ) .
Spl is involved in transcription of many cell-type specific genes , including the myeloid specific integrin CD11b ( 45 ) , the monocytic specific gene CD14 ( 46 ) , the liver specific « 1 acid glycoprotein ( 47 ) , and the « 2 integrin gene ( 48 ) .
These observations appear to be valid for the ASM promoter as well , as our studies showed an increased binding affinity for Spl in EMSAs and enhanced promoter activity in cotransfection experiments using a Spl expression vector .
In addition , elimination of the Spl binding sites in the ASM promoter resulted in an almost complete elimination of both basal and PMA-induced promoter activity .
Recent studies showed that Spl is implicated in the PMA-induced expression of the WAF/ CIP1 gene in U937 cells and the thromboxane receptor gene expression in K562 cells ( 49 ) .
To examine whether Sp 1 protein levels increase during PMA-mediated differentiation of THP-1 cells , immunoblots with THP-nuclear extracts were carried out .
Here , we demonstrate that the amount of Spl protein is markedly increased in PMA-induced THP-1 cells .
The transfection experiments and EMSAs also demonstrated that the transcription factor AP2 is critically involved in the regulated expression of the ASM gene during monocyte to macrophage differentiation .
AP2 is an inducible nuclear factor controlling gene expression in embryonic development and cellular differentiation ( 50 ) .
AP-2 transactivation is subject to multiple regulatory mech-anisms .
Phorbol esters and cAMP-regulated signalling have been found to induce AP-2 activity independent of increased mRNA and protein levels ( 51 ) .
However , terato-carcinoma cells stimulated with retinoic acid show increased transcriptional activation of the AP-2 gene ( 52 ) .
AP-2 activity can also be down-regulated by an alternative splice product of its own gene ( 53 , 54 ) .
Sequence analysis of the ASM promoter revealed two binding sites for PU.1 , a member of the Ets family of transcription factors , which is restricted to macrophages and B-cells ( 35 ) .
PU.1 was shown to be responsible for the cell-specific expression of several genes , including the macrophage scavenger receptor gene ( 29 ) .
Using EMSAs we provide evidence that PU.1 does not play a significant role in ASM gene expression in differentiating THP-1 cells .
In summary , we propose that the transcription factors Spl and AP-2 are required for the up regulation of ASM expression during monocytic differentiation .
In the fu-ture , it will be of great interest to study whether these two transcriptional activators might also regulate the expression of other genes during monocytic differentiation .
