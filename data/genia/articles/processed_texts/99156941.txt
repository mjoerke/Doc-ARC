T-cell Expression of the Human GATA-3 Gene Is Regulated by a Non-lineage-specific Silencer* ( Received for publication , November 16 , 1998 , and in revised form , December 8 , 1998 ) Jean-Marc Grégoire } and Paul-Henri Roméo§ From INSERM U.474 , Hopital Henri Mondor , 94010 Créteil , France The GATA-3 transcription factor is required for development of the T-cell lineage and Th2 cytokine gene expression in CD4 T-cells .
We have mapped the DNase-I-hypersensitive ( HS ) regions of the human GATA-3 gene in T-cells and non-T-cells and studied their transcriptional activities .
HS I-III , located 5 from the transcriptional initiation site , were found in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells , whereas HS IV-VII , located 3 ' from the transcriptional start site , were exclusively observed in T-cells .
Among these hypersensitive sites , two transcriptional control elements were found , one in the first intron of the GATA-3 gene and the other between 8.3 and 5.9 kilobases 5 ' from the GATA-3 transcriptional initiation site .
The first intron acted as a strong transcriptional activator in a position-dependent manner and with no cell-type specificity .
The upstream regulatory element could confer T-cell specificity to the GATA-3 promoter activity , and analysis of this region revealed a 707-base pair silencer that drastically inhibited GATA-3 promoter activity in non-T-cells .
Two CAGGTG E-boxes , located at the 5'- and 3'-ends of the si-lencer , were necessary for this silencer activity .
The 3'-CAGGTG E-box could bind USF proteins , the ubiquitous repressor ZEB , or the basic helix-loop-helix proteins E2A and HEB , and we showed that a competition between ZEB and E2A/HEB proteins is involved in the silencer activity .
Lineage commitment and differentiation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells occur throughout life and are mostly regulated at the transcriptional level ( 1 ) .
Multiple studies have now shown that lineage-restricted expression of a subset of transcription factors is essential to achieve proper development of all the hematopoietic lineages , and therefore , the knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the expression of these lineage-restricted transcription factors is of considerable importance for further understanding of hematopoiesis .
Transcription factors of the GATA family are related by their conserved zinc-finger motif that binds to the consensus DNA sequence 5- ( A/T ) GATA ( A/G ) -3 ' ( 2 ) .
Among the GATA factors , GATA-1 , -2 , and -3 are necessary for hematopoiesis , as gene disruption of any one of these factors results in major hematopoietic defects ( 3-6 ) .

GATA-1 is abundant in the erythrocytic , mastocytic , and megakaryocytic lineages and is also present at a lower level in multipotential progenitors ( 7-9 ) ; GATA-2 is mostly expressed in uncommitted hematopoietic progenitors , immature erythroid cells , and proliferating mast cells ( 10 ) ; and GATA-3 is expressed in very immature hematopoietic progenitors and then only in the T-cell and natural killer cell lineages ( 11 , 12 ) .
GATA-3 was first shown to be abundantly expressed in T-lymphocytes , natural killer cells , and embryonic brain ( 13 , 14 ) .
More detailed studies have shown that GATA-3 gene expression occurs in numerous sites during development : placenta , kidney , and adrenal gland ; the embryonic central and peripheral nervous systems ; and embryonic liver and thymus ( 14 ) .
Contrasting with this wide expression during development , GATA-3 mRNAs are mostly detected in thymocytes and T-lymphocytes and in the central nervous system in the adult .
This gene expression pattern , regulated during development and cellular differentiation , might be mediated by a complex array of cis-acting elements , as shown in the regulation of transcription factor genes in invertebrates ( 15 ) .
As for hematopoiesis , an extinction of GATA-3 gene expression in stable cell hybrids formed by fusion of cell lines representing the erythrocytic and the T-lymphocytic lineages indicated that GATA-3 might be repressed in hematopoietic non-T-cells ( 16 ) , a kind of regulation already shown for the CD4 gene , another T-cell-specific gene ( 17 ) .
The human , mouse , and chicken GATA-3 genes have been cloned , and sequence analysis of their promoters revealed that they are embedded within a CpG island and share structural features often found in promoters of housekeeping genes ( 14 , 18 , 19 ) .
Transfection experiments of reporter genes controlled by the mouse or chicken GATA-3 promoter have failed to show any appropriate T-cell-regulated expression , which indicates that the GATA-3 regulatory elements lie 5 and/or 3 ' from the GATA-3 promoter ( 14 , 19 ) .
To understand the transcriptional controls that regulate GATA-3 gene expression in T-cells , we have mapped the DNase-I-hypersensitive ( HS ) * regions of the human GATA-3 gene in T-cells and in hematopoietic non-T-cells , and we have studied the role of these regions in GATA-3 gene expression in T-cells .

RESULTS Mapping of the DNase-I-hypersensitive Sites of the Human GATA-3 Locus-Hypersensitivity of chromatin to DNase-I digestion has been used to identify regulatory elements of numerous genes ( 27 , 28 ) .
To determine which regions of the human GATA-3 locus might be implicated in the regulation of its expression in T-cells , we mapped the DNase-I HS sites in 35 kb of human genomic DNA encompassing the human GATA-3 transcription unit in a T-cell line ( Jurkat ) that expresses human GATA-3 and in a non-hematopoietic cell line ( HeLa ) and an erythrocytic cell line ( K562 ) that do not express human GATA-3 .
Fig .
1A shows the mapping of DNase-I HS sites after EcoRV-Bgill digestion and hybridization with a 5'-Bgill-Clal probe .
In addition to the 12-kb germ line fragment , two fragments of 7 and 2.5 kb were observed exclusively in the Jurkat cell line , and a fragment of 1.1 kb was detected in the three cell lines studied .
The 2.5-kb fragment results from DNase digestion around the transcriptional initiation site of the human GATA-3 gene ; the 7-kb fragment located an HS site in intron 3 ; and the 1.1-kb fragment identified a region located 1.5 kb 5 from the transcriptional initiation site of the human GATA-3 gene .
Using Sail digestion and a 3'-Sspl-Sstl probe , we then mapped two HS sites , located between exons 5 and 6 and found only in Jurkat T-cells ( Fig .
1B ) .
Using other digests , we finally mapped the seven HS sites that are shown in Fig .
1C .
Interestingly , the 5-HS sites were found in all the cell lines tested , whereas the 3'-HS sites were found only in the Jurkat cell line .
Human GATA-3 Contains a Minimal Promoter That Extends in the First Intron-To look for any regulatory function of the HS sites previously mapped , we first delimited the human GATA-3 minimal promoter .
A segment of the human GATA-3 gene encompassing the presumptive minimal promoter , from nucleotides -96 to +44 , was first studied ( Fig .
24 ) .
After transient transfection into a T-cell line ( Jurkat ) and into two cell lines that do not express human GATA-3 ( HeLa and K562 ) , we detected a weak transcriptional activity that did not display any cell-type specificity ( Fig .
2A ) .
By primer extension , we showed that the transfected constructs were correctly initiated in the three cell lines ( data not shown ) .

HS I and HS II confer T-cell specificity to the human GATA-3 promoter .
Sequential 5'-deletions of the -8025/+598 DNA fragment that contained HS I-IV were fused to the CAT reporter gene and stably transfected into cells lines that express ( Jurkat T-cell line ; ] ) or do not express ( HeLa non-hematopoietic ( 2 ) and K562 erythrocytic ( @ ) cell lines ) human GATA-3 .

sequence ( up to -2500 ) did not change the transcriptional activity of the -96/+44 DNA fragment or bring any T-cell specificity to the constructs used ( data not shown ) .
However , the addition of 554 nucleotides located 3 ' from the -94/+44 DNA fragment resulted in a 6-10-fold enhancement of transcriptional activity in the three cell lines ( Fig .
24 ) .
This 554-nucleotide fragment contained both the first exon and most of the first intron of the human GATA-3 gene and , together with the -96/+44 DNA fragment , defined the -96/+598 human GATA-3 minimal promoter .
To delimit the regions involved in the activity of this promoter , we subjected this fragment to 3'-deletion analysis .
As shown in Fig .
2B , this analysis defined a 123-bp DNA fragment , located at the end of the first intron , as necessary for efficient activity of the human GATA-3 promoter .
We then looked for any position dependence of this 3'-element .
A 390-bp DNA fragment containing the human GATA-3 promoter 3'-element was cloned in both orientations 5 or 3 `` from the -96/+44 DNA fragment ( Fig .
2C ) .
Only the constructs that contained the 390-bp DNA fragment 3 ' from the -96/+44 DNA fragment were transcriptionally active in the three cell lines tested , indicating that the 3'-element acted as a strong transcriptional activator in a position-dependent manner and with no cell-type specificity .
Characterization of a DNA Fragment That Confers T-cell Specificity to the Human GATA-3 Minimal Promoter-All the DNA fragments that encompassed the different HS sites mapped in the human GATA-3 locus were cloned 5 ' from the -96/+598 human GATA-3 promoter , and the resulting constructs were stably transfected into Jurkat , K562 , and Hela cell lines .
None of the 3'-T-cell-specific HS sites provided any specificity to the -96/+598 human GATA-3 promoter ( data not shown ) , and thus , we focused our study on the 5'-region of the human GATA-3 gene .
Starting from a construct that contained all the 5-HS sites , we performed deletion analysis to study , by stable transfections , the three 5-HS sites ( Fig .
3 ) .
The 8.3-kb DNA fragment that contained all the 5'-HS sites displayed a T-cell specificity .
The 6.5-kb DNA fragment containing only HS II and HS III showed a higher transcriptional activity in Jurkat cells than in Hela or K562 cells , but the difference between these three cell lines was smaller than that observed with the 8.3-kb DNA fragment , as the transcriptional activity of this 6.5-kb DNA fragment was present in Hela and K562 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
The 3-kb DNA fragment that contained only HS III displayed no cell-type specificity and was as active as the human GATA-3 minimal promoter in all three cell lines ( Fig .
3 ) .
To demonstrate that HS I and HS II were sufficient for T-cell specificity , a 2.1-kb DNA fragment that contained these two HS sites was cloned 5¢ from the human GATA-3 minimal promoter , and this construct was stably transfected into Jurkat , K562 , and Hela cells .
As shown in Fig .
3 , this 2.1-kb DNA fragment conferred T-cell specificity to the human GATA-3 minimal promoter , indicating that HS I and HS II were necessary and sufficient for T-cell specificity of the human GATA-3 minimal promoter in the assay we used .
HS I Acts as a Strong Silencer in Non-T-cells-To characterize the function of HS I and HS II , a 966-bp DNA fragment ( -8025 to -7059 ) containing only HS I was cloned 5 from the human GATA-3 promoter , and the resulting construct was stably transfected into Hela , K562 , and Jurkat cells .
This fragment repressed human GATA-3 promoter activity in the HeLa and K562 cell lines , but not in the Jurkat T-cell line .
The repression level was identical to the one obtained with the HS I-HS II DNA fragment ( Fig .
4 ) , and interestingly , this silencer did not reduce the transcriptional activity of the human 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 6572 GATA-3 Gene Regulation in T-cells -96 E +598 HSI HS II 8025 ‘ -7059 ‘ -5900 -96 | +598 L I L 1 HSI 8025 i 7059 -96 | +598 HSI 7059 { $ 025 95 ] +598 HS I 7059 1 5900 -96 I +598 rrr p= P 0 10 T T T T T y-20 30 40 50 60 70 Fold Stimulation Fic .

Characterization of a non-T-cell silencer .
The -8025/-5900 DNA fragment containing HS I and HS II was cut to generate a -8025/-7059 DNA fragment that contained only HS I and a -7059/-5900 DNA fragment that contained only HS II .
These two DNA fragments were cloned 5 from the human GATA-3 promoter , and all these constructs were cloned 5 `` from the CAT reporter gene .
The different constructs were stably transfected into T-cell ( Jurkat ; [ ] ) , non-hematopoietic ( HeLa ; 2 ) , and erythrocytic ( K562 ; & § ) cell lines , and the CAT activities were quantified using a PhosphorImager .
The values represent the average of three independent pools of transfected cells , and 1 represents the CAT activity obtained with the pBL-CAT-3 vector .

GATA-3 minimal promoter in T-cells ( data not shown ) .
The orientation dependence of this negative regulatory element was tested by inserting the 966-bp DNA fragment in reverse orientation 5 from the human GATA-3 promoter , and indeed , the transcriptional inhibition obtained with this construct was the same , indicating that this silencer was orientation-independ-ent ( Fig .
4 ) .
We then cloned a 1.1-kb DNA fragment ( -7059 to -5900 ) containing only HS II 5 from the human GATA-3 minimal promoter and stably transfected the resulting construct into Hela , K562 , and Jurkat cells .
We obtained a 5-6-fold decrease in the transcriptional repression in Hela and K562 cells , and we got a 2-3-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of the human GATA-3 promoter in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
These results indicate that HS I contains a major regulatory element that confers T-cell specificity to the human GATA-3 minimal promoter .
We thus performed a detailed analysis of this silencer .
A 5'- and a 3'-Element Are Necessary for HS I Silencing-S5'-and 3'-deletion analysis of this silencer revealed two cis-acting elements that were necessary for efficient silencing of the human GATA-3 promoter activity .
The 5'-element was located between -7828 and -7746 , and the 3'-element was located between -7197 and -7121 ( Fig .
5 ) .
This analysis was done by stable transfection , and we next examined whether these elements were sufficient for efficient repression .
We cloned the various deleted regions 5 ' from the human GATA-3 minimal promoter and transfected these constructs into HeLa or Jurkat cells , but never obtained any efficient repression of the human GATA-3 promoter ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the silencer identified requires multiple elements to be functional .
The sequence of the 707-bp DNA fragment ( -7828 to -7121 ) containing HS I is shown in Fig .
6 .
The 3'-DNA fragment necessary for efficient repression in non-T-cells contained a YY1-binding site adjacent to a CAGGTG E-box and a TC-CTCCT motif already shown to be required for neuronal expression of the zebrafish gata-2 gene ( 29 ) , and the 5'-DNA fragment characterized also contained a CAGGTG E-box .
The presence of this same motif in the 5'- and 3'-regions of the silencer prompted us to analyze its function .
The Two CAGGTG E-boxes Are Necessary for HS I Silencing Activity-As the -7828/-7121 DNA fragment has the same transcriptional activity as the initial -8025/-7059 repressor , the role of the two CAGGTG E-boxes in HS I silencing activity was tested in this DNA fragment beginning with the 3'-region .
Mutations that deleted or disrupted the 3'-CAGGTG E-box were shown by gel-shift analysis to prevent binding of any protein ( data not shown ) , and stable transfections of the resulting constructs showed that they were completely unable to silence the human GATA-3 promoter activity in non-T-cells and did not modify this promoter activity in T-cells ( Fig .
7A ) .
A similar mutation was performed on the 5-CAGGTG E-box , and stable transfections of the mutated silencer showed that it could not repress the human GATA-3 promoter activity in non-T-cells ( Fig .
7B ) .
These results indicate that the HS I silencing activity needs these two CAGGTG E-boxes .
The 3'-CAGGTG E-box Could Bind ZEB , USF , and E2A Proteins-To characterize the proteins that can bind the 3'-CAGGTG E-box , we first performed gel-shift analysis using Jurkat or Helia nuclear extract .
As shown in Fig .
8A , two complexes ( Cl and C2 ) were obtained with Jurkat or Hela nuclear extract , whereas a third complex ( C3 ) was obtained only with Jurkat nuclear extract .
To define the proteins present in these three complexes , we first used competition with oligonucleotides known to bind EZA or related proteins ( E5 oligonucleotide ) or the ubiquitous ZEB repressor ( MEF1m oligonucleotide ) ( 26 ) .
These experiments showed that the C1 complex had the same migration as a ZEB complex ( Fig .
8B , lanes 4 and 7 ) and that the 3'-CAGGTG E-box oligonucleotide efficiently competed the ZEB binding on the MEF1m oligonucleotide ( Zanes 7 and 8 ) .
The C3 complex migrated like the E2A complex bound on the uE5 oligonucleotide ( Fig .

Sequence of the human GATA-3 gene silencer .
The -7828/-7121 DNA fragment containing the human GATA-3 gene silencer was sequenced on both strands .
The potential DNA-binding sites present in the 5'- and 3'-elements defined by the deletion analysis of the HS I silencer are indicated in boldface letters .
The nucleotide sequence has been submitted to the GenBank `` /EBI Data Bank with accession number AJ 181811. efficiently competed each other ( Zanes 2 and 3 and lanes 4 and 6 , respectively ) .
To characterize the proteins present in the C1 , C2 , and C3 complexes , we used antibodies against ZEB , E2A , HEB , USF1 , and USF2 for supershift assays .
As shown in Fig .
8C , the addition of anti-ZEB antibodies supershifted the C1 complex , whereas the addition of control serum had no effect on this complex ( compare lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Increasing amounts of anti-ZEB antibodies completely abolished the formation of the Cl complex , but also abolished the supershift shown in Fig .
8C ( lane 2 ) ( data not shown ) .
To identify the proteins present in this C3 complex , antibodies against E2A or HEB protein were used for supershift assays , and both antibodies completely supershifted the C3 complex , indicating that this complex contains a heterodimer of HEB and E2A proteins ( Fig .
8D , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Finally , antibodies against human USF1 or USF2 basic helix-loop-helix protein showed that the C2 complex contained homo- and heterodimers consisting of these two proteins ( Fig .
8E , lanes 2-4 ) .
In conclusion , the 3'-CAGGTG E-box oligonucleotide could bind ZEB and USF proteins in Hela cells , whereas it bound ZEB , USF , and an E2A/HEB heterodimer in Jurkat T-cells .

The CAGGTG E-boxes pres 7121 ent 5 and 3 ' from the HS I silencer are necessary for efficient repression of the human GATA-3 promoter activity .

6 i : + 5|98 IIC gene repression , we cotransfected a ZEB expression vector together with the human GATA-3 promoter linked to the -7828/-7121 repressor or to the mutated -7828/-7121 fragment that could not bind ZEB ( mutant CAGGTG - CAGGCC described in Fig .
7A ) .
Overexpression of ZEB resulted in significantly reduced transcriptional activity of the -7828/-7121 construct in Jurkat T-cells ( 65 % repression ) , whereas the mutated version of this DNA fragment was not sensible to this ZEB overexpression ( Fig .
9A ) .
These results indicate that ZEB is involved in the repression obtained with the -7828/-7121 DNA fragment through the 3'-CAGGTG E-box .
We then performed several point mutations of the 3'-CAGGTG E-box , which can bind ZEB , E2A/HEB , and USF proteins .
We transformed this 3'-E-box to a MEFlm sequence , i.c .
a sequence that can weakly bind ZEB and neither E2A/HEB nor USF ( Fig .
8B , lane 7 ) ( 26 ) ; to the sequence AGTTCAGGTGT- T T T 0 10 20 30 40 Fold Stimulation GTT located at -361 in the human a , -integrin promoter and shown to bind only ZEB and USF proteins ( 30 , 31 ) ; or to a « E2 sequence known to bind only ZEB and E2A/HEB proteins ( 32 ) .
Stable transfections of the resulting constructs in Hela and Jurkat T-cells showed that the mutated « E2 sequence had the same effect as the wild type 3'-E-box , whereas the MEF1m or -361 sequence induced a repression of the human GATA-3 promoter in Jurkat T-cells ( Fig .
9B ) .
These results indicate that the E2A/HEB heterodimer , but not the USF proteins , can relieve the repression mediated by ZEB on the 3'-E-box .

B5 ( lane 3 ) , 8'-CAGGTG E-box ( lane 4 ) , and MEFIm ( Zane 7 ) oligonucleotides were used as probes in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with Jurkat nuclear extract .
Cold competition of wB5 binding with uE5 ( Zane 1 ) or the 3'-E-box ( Zane 2 ) , of 3'-E-box binding with the 8'-Ei-box ( lane 5 ) or wB5 ( lane 6 ) , and of MEF1m binding with the 3'-E-box ( Zane 8 ) is shown .

C , anti-ZEB antibodies induce supershift of the C1 complex .
The 3'-CAGGTG E-box oligonucleotide was end-labeled and incubated with a nuclear extract from HeLa cells in the presence of a preimmune ( Zane 1 ) or an immune ( Zane 2 ) serum against ZEB .
Similar results were obtained with a nuclear extract from Jurkat cells , but are not shown as the C3 complex migrated at the same position as the anti-ZEB supershift complex .
The C1 and C2 complexes are indicated by arrows .
D , supershift of the C3 complex with an anti-E12/E47 or anti-HEB antibody .
The end-labeled 3'-CAGGTG E-box oligonucleotide was incubated with a nuclear extract from Jurkat cells in the presence of a preimmune serum ( Zane 1 ) or antibodies against E12/ E47 ( lane 2 ) or HEB ( lane 3 ) .
The C1 , C2 , and C3 complexes are indicated by arrows .

The preimmune serum used in this experiment drastically decreased the C3 complex .

A , overexpression of ZEB in Ju- A rkat T-cells results in -7828/-7121 frag-ment-mediated repression of the human GATA-3 promoter .
The pECB/ZEB expression vector was cotransfected with the human GATA-3 promoter , the -7828/ -7821 human GATA-3 promoter , or a 8'-mutated -7828/-7821 human GATA-3 promoter into Hela ( 2 ) and Jurkat ( C ] ) cells .
The two -7828/-7821 constructs differ only by the CAGGTG - CAGGCC -7828 mutations that impaired ZEB binding to I the 3'-E-box .

I -7112 only in the placenta , the central nervous system , very immature hematopoietic cells , and T-cells in the adult .
To define regulatory sequences that control GATA-3 gene expression in T-cells , we first investigated the DNase-I hypersensitivity of the human GATA-3 gene as DNase-I hypersensitivity has been associated with a wide range of cis-regulatory sequences and is usually indicative of protein-DNA interactions .
Although no T-cell-specific HS site was found 5 ' from the human GATA-3 gene initiation site , three T-cell-specific HS sites were discovered in the 3'-direction .
We assayed these different T-cell-specific HS sites , linked to the endogenous or to a heterologous promoter , in both transient and stable transfections , but we were unable to show any function of these HS sites in transcriptional regulation .
These results indicate a possible requirement for other regulatory elements or that the assays we used could not detect the function of these DNase-I HS sites .
We first determined the cis-acting sequences , located near the transcriptional initiation site and involved in the human GATA-3 gene activation .
We did not find any sequence involved t » I I I 1 `` 0 10 20 30 40 Fold Stimulation in the T-cell-specific activity of the human GATA-3 gene , but mapped a sequence , located in the first intron between +475 and +598 , required for high transcriptional activity .
This sequence did not display classical enhancer activity , as it func-tioned , in both sense and antisense orientations , only when located 3 ' from the GATA-3 minimal promoter .
Similar results have been obtained using the mouse GATA-3 promoter ( 14 ) , and comparison of the mouse and human sequences located at the end of the first intron showed little homology except at their 3'-ends , where the sequence 5 { -CAGGTCTC ( C/T ) -3 ' lies ( in the human and murine introns ) one base 5 from the 3'-splicing sequence .
We then studied the effects of the 5'-HS sites on the transcriptional activity of the human GATA-3 promoter and found that a DNA fragment , located between -8025 and -5900 , could confer T-cell specificity to the human GATA-3 promoter .
This T-cell specificity is mainly mediated by a strong silencer active in non-T-cells and located between -7828 and -7121 .
Previous studies have shown an extinction of the GATA-3 gene 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog GATA-3 Gene Regulation in T-cells 6577 in both murine and human erythroid X T-cell hybrids ( 16 ) and during the commitment of ThO-like cells to Th1 effector cells ( 83 ) .
These extinctions could be direct silencing or loss of positive regulators , and our data strongly support the first hypoth-esis .
Transcriptional regulation by negative regulatory elements is now well documented , and studies using transgenic mice or transfection assays have identified silencers of transcription in numerous tissues and developmentally specific genes ( 34-37 ) .
The position of silencers , like the position of enhancers , varies depending on the gene studied and can be located adjacent to or far away from the regulated promoter ( 38 , 39 ) .
The human GATA-3 silencer was found 7 kb 5 from the promoter and thus belongs to the second type of silencer .
The molecular mechanisms that mediate transcriptional silencing are not completely understood , but several DNA-binding proteins , like COUP-TF or YY1 ( 40 , 41 ) , seem clearly implicated in silencing .
Deletion and point mutation analyses of the human GATA-3 silencer revealed two CAGGTG E-boxes that are necessary but not sufficient for efficient silencing .
Point mutation that destroyed the 5'-CAGGTG E-box resulted in an absence of silencing , indicating the importance of this DNA-binding motif in human GATA-3 gene regulation .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays done with this E-box as a probe revealed two specific complexes present in Jurkat , Hela , and K562 cells ( data not shown ) .
These complexes did not contain ZEB , USF , or E2A protein , as no supershift could be obtained with antisera against all members of the USF , E2A , and ZEB proteins ( data not shown ) .
Further characterizations of these complexes are now needed to understand this 5'-CAGGTG E-box function .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays done with the 3'-CAGGTG E-box revealed three specific complexes , two present in T- and non-T-cells ( Cl and C2 ) and one present only in T-cells ( C3 ) .
These three complexes contained the ubiquitous repressor ZEB ( C1 ) , the USF basic helix-loop-helix proteins ( C2 ) , and an E2A/HEB heterodimer ( C3 ) .
Overexpression of ZEB in T-cells showed that ZEB acted as a repressor , and several point mutations indicated that E2A and HEB , but not USF proteins , were able to relieve ZEB repression in T-cells .
ZEB and E2A/HEB have been shown to regulate genes during hematopoiesis ( 26 , 42 ) , but no competition between these proteins for DNA binding has yet been reported .
ZEB is an active transcriptional repressor that has been shown to regulate both muscle differentiation and a , -integrin gene expression during hematopoiesis ( 30 , 31 ) .
Interestingly , ZEB seems to compete with muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix proteins for the regulation of muscle differentiation ( 381 ) , whereas it impairs the myb-eis synergy during hematopoiesis ( 30 ) .
As for human GATA-3 gene regulation , our results suggest that ZEB represses the human GATA-3 promoter activity and that the E2A/HEB heterodimer can displace ZEB in T-cells .
This HEB heterodimer also positively regulates CD4 gene expression by regulating the activity of its enhancer ( 43 ) , and thus , E2A/HEB heterodimers seem to regulate early and late genes activated during T-cell differentiation .
Interestingly , HEB or E2A mutant homozygous mice seem to have a developmental delay in the transition from the double-negative stage to the double-positive stage ( 42 ) , and studies on chimeras indicated that the differentiation of ~~ T-cells is also blocked at the double-negative stage of development ( 6 ) .
These results , together with the data presented in this paper , strengthen the link between HEB and E2A proteins and GATA-3 gene regulation .
Furthermore , as E2A , HEB , and ZEB proteins are not T-cell-specific , their relative amounts might switch on or switch off the human GATA-3 gene , and thus , these non-lineage-specific proteins might be involved in T-lymphoid determination .
We have previously shown that a cosmid that contains the human GATA-3 transcription unit extended by 4 kb of 3'-flanking sequence and 3 kb of 5 ' -flanking sequence is sufficient for directing T-cell expression ( 18 ) .
This cosmid does not contain the silencer described in this paper , and thus , the human GATA-3 gene seems to be under the control of discrete regulatory elements that can enhance and/or silence the transcriptional activity of a minimal promoter .
Furthermore , a recent publication has characterized an enhancer sequence that regulates mouse GATA-3 gene expression in the brachial arch ( 44 ) .
This enhancer , located between nucleotides -2832 and -2642 , does not confer any T-cell specificity , and thus , the GATA-3 gene seems to be regulated by discrete regulatory elements required for its complex expression pattern .
Such a modular cis-regulatory organization has been described for many genes encoding transcription factors in Drosophila ( 15 ) and shows the actual complexity of cis-regulatory elements that regulate these genes .
