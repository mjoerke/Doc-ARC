We have examined the role of CD28 in modulating the 'naive ' neonatal T cell response to anti-CD2-mediated activation .
To compare the role of CD28 , neonatal and adult T cells were stimulated with a pair of mitogenic anti-CD2 antibodies in the presence or absence of anti-CD28 MoAb .
With anti-CD2 alone , neonatal T cells proliferated slightly but produced no detectable IL-2 , whereas adult T cells proliferated vigorously , with significant IL-2 production .
Costimulation with anti-CD28 MoAb greatly enhanced the proliferative response of neonatal T cells to levels equivalent to those of adult T cells , whereas adult T cells showed only slight increases .
Although IL-2 secretion was increased in the presence of anti-CD28 MoAb , neonatal T cell IL-2 production remained lower than in adults .
In contrast , enhancement of IL-2 mRNA expression in neonates was similar to adult levels .
Anti-CD28 MoAb costimulation increased NFB levels in neonates , albeit to levels lower than that of adults .
The cellular mechanism governing the diminished proliferative response of neonatal T lymphocytes to anti-CD2 may therefore be due to decreased NFxB induction , reduced IL-2 mRNA expression and deficient IL-2 production .
Although anti-CD28 MoAb costimulation enhances all of the above signals , NFB and IL-2 levels remain lower than in adults , suggesting the need for further activation requirements in the neonate .
Keywords neonatal T cells CD28 INTRODUCTION The activation of T lymphocytes is essential for the generation of an effective immune response , and requires the occupancy of the T cell receptor ( TCR ) by foreign antigen complexed with self-MHC as well as an additional signal delivered by antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) [ 1 ] .
The absence of costimulation during TCR engagement has been shown to result in antigen-specific tolerance or anergy [ 1 ] or possibly apoptosis [ 2 ] .
One of the most studied of these costimulatory molecules is CD28 , a 44-kD glycoprotein member of the immunoglobulin superfamily [ 3 ] .
CD28 is expressed by virtually all CD4* T cells and ~ 50 % of human CD8 * T cells .
Treatment of mitogen or anti-TCR-stimulated T cells with MoAbs directed against CD28 induces a substantial increase in T cell proliferation , primarily due to an increase in IL-2 synthesis [ 4 ] .
This super-induction of IL-2 production involves two mechanisms : stabilization of IL-2 mRNA [ 5,6 ] , and enhanced gene transcription mediated at least in part by activation of the transcription factor , NFxB , by CD28 [ 7,8 ] .
NFKB is a key regulator of IL-2 gene expression .
In addition to IL-2 up-regulation , CD28 signal transduction also increases the mRNA and secretion of several Correspondence : Dr Jaythoon Hassan , Children 's Research Centre , Our Lady 's Hospital for Sick Children , Crumlin , Dublin 12 , Ireland .
192 IL-2 mRNA - NFkB other T cell-expressed cytokines , including granulocyte-macro-phage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , IL-3 , tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-a ) and TNF- [ 9 ] .
With regard to IL-2 production in the neonate , increased [ 10 ] , normal [ 11 ] or reduced [ 12,13 ] , secretion have been reported [ 10-13 ] .
These differences may be due to the use of different types of stimulating agents which have been reported to induce distinct patterns of cytokine production [ 14 ] .
In a recent report , we showed that the diminished proliferative response to anti-CD2 antibodies was paralleled by reduced IL-2 mRNA expression in neonatal T cells [ 15 ] .
This deficient response by neonatal T cells may represent true functional immaturity , but may also suggest that signalling through specific antigen receptors in the neonate may be dependent on costimulatory interactions for generation of an appropriate response .
Since a signal delivered by the CD28 molecule has been shown to reverse anergy [ 16 ] , we addressed the question whether costimulation of neonatal T cells via CD28 could serve as a second signal to prevent the anti-CD2-induced hyporesponsiveness of these cells .
The data strongly suggest that signalling of neonatal T cells via CD28 reverses the hyporesponsiveness to anti-CD2 antibodies and may play an important role in the expansion and generation of the neonatal immune response .

Anti-CD28 MoAb ( 9.3 ) was a gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute ( Seat-tle , WA ) .
Isotype control antibodies used were FITC-IgG1 and PE-IgG2 ( Becton Dickinson , Oxford , UK ) .
Cell preparation Cord blood was collected from the umbilical vein , immediately after delivery , in uncomplicated pregnancies at term ( mean gestation = 40 weeks , range 38-41 weeks ) .
Venous peripheral blood was obtained from healthy adult volunteers .
Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque ( Lymphoprep , Nycomed , Norway ) density gradient centrifugation and resuspended in complete culture medium .
T cells were purified by two passages through nylon wool ( Poly Sciences , Northamp-ton , UK ) columns according to the method of Julius et a/ .
[ 18 ] .
FACScan analysis revealed these cells to be > 95 % CD3 * , < 1 % CD19* , < 1 % CD14* , and they were considered to be purified T cells .
Cell proliferation assay All cell cultures were carried out in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gisco , Paisley , UK ) supplemented with L-glutamine ( 2 mm ) , gentamycin ( 50 ug/ml ) , fungizone ( 2 pg/ml ) , and 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( FCS ) .
T cells ( 2 x 10°/well ) were cultured in triplicate in 96-well flat-bottomed microtitre plates ( Nunc , Roskilde , Denmark ) .
Cell proliferation was obtained by adding the combination of anti-CD2 antibodies at 0-25 ug/ml final concentration .
Anti-CD28 MoAb was used at 1:1000 dilution .
The plates were incubated in a 5 % CO ; humidified atmosphere at 37°C for 72 h. Cell proliferation was measured by °H-thymidine incorporation ( 0-3 Ci ; sp .
act .
25 Ci/mmol ; Amersham , Aylesbury , UK ) during the last 18 h of culture and counted in a liquid scintillation counter .
Results are expressed as the mean ct/min °H-thymidine incorporation .
IL-2 production T cell cultures were set up in l-ml volumes .
After 24 h , cells were pelleted .
Supernatants were stored at -20°C until IL-2 levels were measured using a CTLL IL-2-dependent cell line .
Recombinant human IL-2 ( Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) was used as reference standard for the IL-2 bioassay .
RNA extraction and dot blot analysis T cells were stimulated for 18 h. Cytoplasmic lysates were prepared for mRNA analysis as previously described [ 19 ] .
Briefly , cells were pelleted and washed with PBS .
The cell pellets were lysed for 5 min in 200 ul of lysis buffer containing 140 mm NaCl , 1-5 mm MgCl , 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 86 , 1 mm DTT , placental RNAase inhibitor ( 1000 U/ml ) and 0:5 % Nonidet P-40 .
The cell nuclei were pelleted and the supernatants transferred to a fresh tube .
Two-hundred microlitres of proteinase K digestion buffer ( 0:2 m Tris-HCl pH 8:0 , 25 mm EDTA pH 8:0 , 0-3 m NaCl , 2 % SDS ) and proteinase K to a final concentration of 50 ug/ml were added , mixed and incubated at 37°C for 30 min .
Two cycles of phenol : chloroform extraction and one cycle of chloroform : isoamylaleohol extraction were performed .
RNA was precipitated with 0-3 m sodium acetate pH 5-2 ( final concentration ) and 2:5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol and stored at ~70°C until use .
To recover the RNA , samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 4°C at 9000 g , the ethanol removed and the RNA resuspended in 10 ul DEPC-treated H ; , O. RNA was pretreated at 68°C for 15 min with 20 ul formamide , 7 ul formaldehyde and 2 pul 20 x SSC .
Eighty microlitres of 20 x SSC were added to the RNA and samples were applied onto Hybond N + nylon membrane ( Amersham ) using a slot blot manifold and the membrane was then baked for 2 h at 80°C .
Pre-hybridization was performed in 5 ml of gold hybridization buffer according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( Amersham ) at 42°C for 2 h. Gel-purified cDNA probes for IL-2 ( ATCC , Rockville , MD ) and A-actin were labelled with horseradish peroxidase using the direct labelling procedure of the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit ( Amer-sham ) .
Hybridization was performed at 42°C for 16 h. Stringency washes were performed at 42°C with two 20-min washes with 0-5 x SSC , 0:4 % SDS , 6 m urea followed by a further two 10-min washes at room temperature in 2 x SSC .
Hybridization was assessed by chemiluminescence and autoradiography and slot blots were analysed by densitometry .
Adult and neonatal T cells were stimulated and processed in parallel in each experi-ment .
Preparation of nuclear extracts T cells were cultured with medium alone ( unstimulated ) , anti-CD2 MoAbs , anti-CD2 + anti-CD28 MoAbs or anti-CD28 MoAb alone for 2 h at 37°C .
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Osborn et a/ .
[ 20 ] .
Briefly , cells were washed in cold PBS followed by washing in Buffer A ( containing 10 mm HEPES pH 79 , 1:5 mm MgCl , 10 mm KCL , 0-5 mm PMSF and 0-5 mm DTT ) .
The cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ul Buffer A containing 01 % NP40 and placed on ice for 10 min .
Following centrifugation at 9000 g for 10 min at 4°C , the pellets were resuspended in 15 pul buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7-9 , 420 mm NaCl , 1:5 mm MgCl , , 02 mm EDTA , 25 % glycerol and 0:5 mm PMSF and placed on ice for 15 min .
After centrifugation , the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and 75 pl of buffer containing 10 mm HEPES pH 7-9 , 50 mm KCl , 02 mm EDTA , 20 % glycerol , 0-5 mm PMSF , 0-5 mm DTT were added .
Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay ( BioRad , Hemel Hempstead , UK ) .
Electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay Nuclear extracts ( 1 ug of protein ) were incubated with 10 000 ct/min of a 22 bp oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence which had been previously labelled with y-*°P-ATP ( 10 mCi/mmol ) by T4 polynucleotide kinase [ 21 ] .
Incuba-tions were performed for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) and 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer pH 7-5 , containing 1 m NaCl , 10 mm EDTA , 50 mm DTT , 40 % ( w/v ) glycerol and 1 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) .
All incubation mixtures were subjected to electrophor-esis on native 4 % ( w/v ) polyacrylamide gels which were subsequently dried and autoradiographed .

RESULTS Costimulation of neonatal T cells with anti-CD28 MoAb We have previously shown that proliferative responses of purified cord T cells to anti-CD2 stimulation results in reduced responses compared with adult T cells [ 15 ] .
Using this system , we investigated the ability of anti-CD28 MoAb to provide a costimulatory requirement in cultures of purified T cells .
Figure 1 shows that the presence of anti-CD28 MoAb in anti-CD2-stimulated neonatal T cell cultures resulted in markedly enhanced proliferation ( from 6754 +2298 ct/min to 57 460 + 16 129 ct/min ; P < 0-001 ) .
In contrast , in adult T cell cultures further enhancement of proliferation in the presence of anti-CD28 MoAb , although significant ( P < 0:03 ) , was modest .
This finding is in agreement with a previous report [ 9 ] which showed no enhancement of T cell proliferation as a 20 IL-2 ( U/mi1 ) Unstim .

The presence of anti-CD28 MoAb in combination with anti-CD2 to neonatal T cells restored the proliferative response to adult T cell levels .
Unstimulated cultures or cultures with anti-CD28 MoAb alone showed no thymidine uptake .
Effect of anti-CD28 MoAb on IL-2 secretion Costimulation with anti-CD28 MoAb has been documented to enhance IL-2 production by human T cells [ 9 ] .
Addition of anti-CD28 MoAb to anti-CD2-stimulated adult and neonatal T cells resulted in markedly enhanced IL-2 secretion ( Fig .
2 ) .
However , IL-2 production by adult T cells in the presence of CD2 and CD2 + CD28 was significantly greater than IL-2 levels produced by similarly stimulated neonatal T cells ( P < 0-01 ; P < 0-02 ) .
Furthermore , it was noted that when adult T cells were stimulated with anti-CD2 plus anti-CD28 , there was a substantial augmentation in the secretion of IL-2 , yet the proliferative response was only modestly increased .
These findings are in agreement with those of Thompson et al .

enhancement of IL-2 secretion in adult T cells costimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-C D28 MoAbs was observed .
The mean fold enhancement of IL-2 production induced in the presence of anti-CD28 MoAb was much greater in neonatal T cell cultures ( 26-8-fold ) compared with adult cultures ( 6-8-fold ) .
Cultures containing anti-CD28 MoAb alone did not result in IL-2 production in any of the samples studied .
Effect of exogenous IL-2 on anti-CD2-mediated activation of neonatal T cells Because endogenous IL-2 production by neonatal T lymphocytes activated with anti-CD2 alone was low .

Effect of anti-CD28 MoAb on NF « B levels is shown .

Results shown are representative of three separate experiments .

The data demonstrate that the addition of anti-CD28 MoAb to T cells enhanced the expression of IL-2 mRNA levels in both groups .
The most striking observation is the lack of IL-2 mRNA expression in anti-CD2-stimulated cord T cells , whereas the presence of anti-CD28 MoAb significantly increased the expression of IL-2 transcript to a level similar to adult T cells .
Effect of anti-CD28 MoAb on NFKB levels Since it has recently been reported that the CD28-responsive complex present in the promoter region of the IL-2 gene contains at least three members of the NFB family [ 7,8 ] , levels of NFB in nuclear extracts of T cells stimulated with anti-CD2 and anti-CD28 MoAb for 2 h were examined .
Figure 5 shows NFB levels using the electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay ( EMSA ) .
As the data demonstrate , unstimulated cells or cells treated with anti-CD28 MoAb alone showed low levels of NFB .
Anti-CD2 activation induced an increase in NFkB which was greatly augmented when anti-CD28 MoAb was added as costimulus to the cells .
In the neonatal T cell samples , NFxB induction in response to anti-CD2 stimulation was low compared with adults .
Although addition of anti-CD28 MoAb to neonatal cells increased NFkB levels , it was not restored to the levels observed in adults .
Surface expression of CD2 and CD28 on neonatal T cell Expression of the CD28 antigen on five neonatal and five adult peripheral blood T cells was examined using the whole blood lysis method .
CD2 and CD28 expression was found to be similar in adults ( AD ) and neonates ( NB ) ( MFI + s.e.m .
: CD2 , NB 7345 +807 ; AD 7886 +713 ; CD28 , NB 66-49 + 3-01 ; AD 64-06 + 3:50 ) .
The percentage of cells staining for CD2 and CD28 was also similar in adults and neonates ( mean + s.e.m .
: CD2 , NB 711 + 32 % ; AD 751 + 08 % ; CD28 , NB 61-0 + 36 % ; AD 63-2 + 1+2 % ) .
DISCUSSION The experiments described here demonstrate that activation via the CD28 cell surface molecule provides a potent amplification signal for neonatal T cell responses .
Anti-CD2-stimulated neonatal T cells showed greater augmentation of responses as observed by proliferative capacity , IL-2 production , IL-2 mRNA expression and NFB levels in the presence of anti-CD28 MoAb compared with adult T cells .
It has been proposed that the CD2 pathway of T cell activation functions as an early thymocyte proliferative signal , since human CD2 is expressed early in thymic ontogeny before expression of the TCR-CD3 complex [ 22 ] .
Phenotypic studies have suggested that neonatal T cells are similar to recent emigrants from the thymus .
Nearly all T cells from neonates express the thymocyte surface antigens , CD10 and CD38 [ 23,24 ] .
Furthermore , similar to mature thymocytes , the vast majority of neonatal T cells express the high molecular weight isoform of the CD45 molecule , as identified by antibodies to CD4SRA [ 25 ] .
Evidence suggests that the CD45RA subset of T cells is antigenically naive , and we have further proposed that neonatal naive T cells are precursors of adult naive T cells [ 26 ] .
Previous studies have shown that in contrast to peripheral blood adult T cells , thymocytes are unable to proliferate in response to CD2 stimulation [ 27 ] .
Similarly , we and others in in vitro studies of neonatal T cell responses have demonstrated deficient responses to antibodies that activate signalling through the CD2 molecule [ 15,28 ] .
Anti-CD2 stimulation of adult T cells was sufficient to induce a proliferative response .
However , anti-CD2 stimulation of neonatal T cells resulted in a deficient proliferative response .
Furthermore , although anti-CD2 stimulation is a poor inducer of IL-2 production , the results reported here indicate that neonatal T cell induction of IL-2 is significantly lower than adult T cells , and contributes to the reduced proliferative response .
These results are consistent with the finding that supplementation of neonatal T cell cultures with IL-2 restores the proliferative capabilities of neonatal T cells .
Therefore , neonatal T cells can be activated through the CD2 molecule , although they appear to require exogenous IL-2 for the induction of proliferative responses similar to that of adult T cells .
Other investigators have reported that expression of the IL-2 receptor is comparable in neonatal and adult T cells [ 29 ] .
Addition of anti-CD28 MoAb greatly augmented IL-2 secretion of neonatal T cells , but this was still less than the IL-2 levels elicited by adult T cells .
The limited capacity of neonatal T cells to secrete IL-2 may indicate that these cells have further activation requirements for the elicitation of a comparable response to adults , although phenotypically © 1995 Blackweli Science Ltd , Clinical and Experimental Immunology , 102:192-198 CD28 signalling of human naive neonatal T lymphocytes 197 neonatal T cells are similar to adult T cells with regard to CD2 and CD28 expression .
In addition to increasing IL-2 mRNA stability , recent studies have shown that signalling via CD28 caused transcrip-tional activation by binding to the CD28-responsive element in the IL-2 enhancer region [ 7,8 ] .
The IL-2 CD28-responsive complex has been shown to contain members of the NFB family [ 7,8 ] .
This is the first demonstration that costimulation of peripheral blood T cells with anti-CD2 and anti-CD28 increases NFxB levels .
The study by Verweij et al .
[ 7 ] examined the Jurkat T cell line , whereas Ghosh et a/ .
[ 8 ] examined peripheral blood T cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and anti-CD28 MoAb .
Anti-CD2 alone induces lower NFB translocation to the nucleus and hence minimal IL-2 mRNA expression in neonatal T cells .
Although costimulation with anti-CD28 MoAb increases NFB levels in the nuclear extracts of cord T cells , levels similar to those of adults were not achieved .
NFB activity is related to the maturational stage of the cell and is developmentally regulated [ 30 ] .
Therefore , the low levels of inducible NFB in neonatal T cells shown in this study provides further evidence of their imma-turity .
Whether there is any link between the lower NFB levels and IL-2 produced in neonatal T cells in the presence of anti-CD28 MoAb costimulation remains unclear .
However , recent data have shown that concentrations of inducible transcription factors are a major component of the regulatory mechanisms which dictate differential IL-2 expression in T cell subsets [ 31 ] .
Previous studies have suggested that neonatal T cells have deficient cell-mediated immune responses [ 11,32 ] .
Because the vast majority of neonatal T cells are of the naive CD45RA phenotype , we suggest the following scenario .
All naive T lymphocytes appear to require a signal from another cell in order to proliferate , and this proliferative response is the necessary precursor to mounting an adequate immune response .
When these same T lymphocytes bind antigen without receiving the necessary costimulatory signals they become anergic .
Recent studies have suggested that CD28 may act as a switch between anergy and activation [ 16 ] .
Our findings show that the T cell lineage surface molecules CD2 and CD28 are involved in the regulation of expansion and further differentiation of neonatal T cells .
However , since IL-2 production in the presence of anti-CD28 MoAb was still lower than in adults , expansion and recruitment of T cells perhaps to an antigenic challenge may result in a delayed response .
Such a delayed T cell response to herpes virus group antigens has been shown in neonates when compared with non-immune adults [ 32 ] .
T cells at different stages of development and in different cytokine environments have different costimulation requirements which may influence the distinctive response that occurs .
However , CD28 may not be the entire story in the neonate , where various other molecules may have significant roles .
Evidence for this comes from a study which shows that mice lacking CD28 , while significantly compromised in their ability to mount adaptive immune responses , are not totally immunodeficient [ 33 ] .
This may reflect other pathways of costimulation of naive neonatal T cells which remain to be studied .
