RAPID COMMUNICATION Stat6 Inhibits Human Interleukin-4 Promoter Activity in T Cells By Steve N. Georas , John E. Cumberland , Thomas F. Burke , Rongbing Chen , Ulrike Schindler , and Vincenzo Casolaro The differentiation of naive T-helper ( Th ) cells into cytokine-secreting effector Th cells requires exposure to multiple signals , including exogenous cytokines .
Interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) plays a major role in this process by promoting the differentiation of IL-4-secreting Th2 cells .
In Th2 cells , IL-4 gene expression is tightly controlled at the level of transcription by the coordinated binding of multiple transcription factors to regulatory elements in the proximal promoter region .
Nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NFAT ) family members play a critical role in regulating IL-4 transcription and interact with up to five sequences ( termed PO through P4 ) in the IL-4 promoter .
The molecular mechanisms by which IL-4 induces expression of the IL-4 gene are not known , although the IL-4-activated transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 ( Stat6 ) is required for this effect .
NTERLEUKIN-4 ( IL-4 ) is a prototypic immunoregulatory cytokine .
!
By virtue of its ability to induce IgE isotype switching in B cells , mast cell differentiation , and adhesion molecule expression , IL-4 plays a central role in many inflammatory responses . ``
IL-4 is also the primary cytokine promoting the differentiation of naive T cells into cytokine-secreting T-helper 2 ( Th2 ) cells . ``
Cytokine gene expression in Th2 cells is controlled primarily at the level of gene transcription , ° and dysregulation of this process is thought to contribute to the development of allergic diseases . ``
Several transcription factors have recently been implicated in regulating Th2-restricted IL-4 gene expression ( Fig 1 ) .
Nuclear factors of activated T cell ( NFAT ) are involved in this process by interacting with up to five sites in the IL-4 promoter ( termed PO through P4 ) .
'* `` `` The precise role of individual NFAT family members in regulating IL-4 transcription is currently unknown .
!
*8 Using T-cell lines derived from NFAT-reporter transgenic mice , Rincon and Flavell `` found that NFAT transcriptional activity is preferentially induced in Th2 cells but not in Thl cells .
Growing evidence suggests that Th2-specific NFAT cofactors may specifically enhance IL-4 transcription in these cells .
For example , Ho et al `` found that the proto-oncogene c-maf was preferentially expressed in Th2 clones and that c-Maf acts synergistically with NFATp to induce IL-4 production in IL-4-negative cells .
Additionally , Li-Weber et al `` detected a multiprotein complex containing C/EBP , NFAT , and AP-1 proteins forming on the P4 element using nuclear extracts from Th2 but not Th1 cells in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) .
Exogenous IL-4 is a critical stimulus for the effective differentiation of naive T cells into IL-4-secreting Th2 cells ( for review , see O'Garra ' ) .
The mechanism by which IL-4 induces expression of the IL-4 gene is currently not known .
IL-4 interacts with a multichain cell-surface receptor ( IL-4R ) that is expressed by several cell types , including B cells , T cells , and endothelial cells.4 `` `` IL-4 binding to the IL-4Ra chain induces different intracellular signals , including Jak-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor Stat6 . ``
'' Stat6 response elements share a consensus sequence * TTCN34GAA®* `` and are Blood , Vol 92 , No 12 ( December 15 ) , 1998 : pp 4529-4538 We report here that Stat6 interacts with three binding sites in the human IL-4 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
These sites overlap the P1 , P2 , and P4 NFAT elements .
To investigate the role of Stat6 in regulating IL-4 transcription , we used Staté-deficient Jurkat T cells with different intact IL-4 promoter constructs in cotransfection assays .
We show that , whereas a multimerized response element from the germline IgE promoter was highly induced by IL-4 in Stat6-expressing Jurkat cells , the intact human IL-4 promoter was repressed under similar conditions .
We conclude that the function of Stat6 is highly dependent on promoter context and that this factor promotes IL-4 gene expression in an indirect manner .

The fundamental role of Stat6 in IL-4-driven responses was demonstrated by the phenotype of Stat6-deficient mice in which IgE synthesis and Th2 responses were abro-gated . ``
Lederer et al `` !
discovered a Stat6 binding site in the mouse IL-4 promoter and found that Stat6é bound this sequence in EMSA using nuclear extracts from IL-4 induced Th2 cells but not Th1 cells .
We and others identified a corresponding site in the human IL-4 promoter ( ~'®TTCACAGGAA~ !

`` % `` `` Because multimers of these elements were inducible by IL-4 when linked to heterologous promoters and transfected into Staté-expressing B-cell lines , `` `` it seemed reasonable to conclude that Stat6 would directly enhance IL-4 transcription in T cells .
However , recent studies have suggested that activation of IL-4R signaling pathways is not required for IL-4 gene expression in effector T cells .
For example , Huang et al `` `` found that IL-4 did not enhance transcription driven by a mouse IL-4 promoter construct in anti-CD3-activated Th2 cells , although the specific role of Stat6 in regulating the intact IL-4 promoter was not examined in that study .
Additionally , Morigg !

Using Stat6-deficient Jurkat T cells in cotransfection assays , we report here that , although cotransfected Stat6 strongly enhanced transcription driven by a multimerized response element , the human IL-4 promoter was significantly repressed under similar conditions .
The repressive effects of Stat6 appeared to involve sequence-specific DNA binding , because a Staté DNA binding domain mutant failed to inhibit the IL-4 promoter .
We describe two novel Stat6 binding sites within the proximal IL-4 promoter and show that Stat6 and NEAT bind competitively to overlapping nucleotides .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid construction .
IL-4 promoter constructs were amplified from human genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) .
A 25-bp 5 ' primer annealing 265 bp upstream from the transcription start site ( tss ) according to Otsuka et al `` `` was used with a 25-bp 3 ' primer ending at position +65 .
PCR products were sequenced using the dideoxy method and then ligated into the HindIH and Xba I sites of pCAT Basic ( Promega , Madison , WI ) to yield pCAT 265 .
The reporter C/EBP-N4 luc contains 4 copies of the composite C/EBP/Stat6 response element from the germline e promoter fused to a thymidine kinase ( TK ) minimal promoter driving the firefly luciferase gene .
* `` The wild-type Stat6 expression vector ( TPU 388 ) and the DNA-binding domain mutant vector ( TPUS22 , in which the 3 amino acids VVI at positions 411 to 413 were replaced by EAA ) , both driven by the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter , have been described . ``
Cell lines and transfections .
- Jurkat T cells ( a kind gift of Dr Jack Strominger , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA ) were maintained in complete medium ( RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum [ FCS ; Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ] and 50 ug/mL gentamycin [ Life Technologies ] ) .
As previously reported , these cells constitutively express IL-4 mRNA .
`` !
HepG2 cells were obtained from the ATCC ( Rockville , MD ) and maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FCS and 50 ug/mL gentamycin .
In cotransfection experiments , 3 X 106 cells were transfected with 1 ug reporter , 2 ug expression or empty vector as a control , and 7 uL Superfect ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) in 5 mL complete medium and allowed to recover for 24 hours .
Cells were then stimulated with combinations of the following agonists as indicated in the text for the last 18 hours : 1 umol/L calcium ionophore ( A23187 ; Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) , 25 ng/mL phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ; Calbiochem ) , and IL-4 ( 10 or 50 ng/mL ; Peprotech , Rocky Hill , NJ ) .
Cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles and reporter gene expression was determined either by measuring CAT enzyme levels using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ; Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) or by assaying for luciferase activity using standard techniques ( Analytic Luminescence Laboratories , Sparks , MD ) .
Cell extracts were normalized for protein content using the Bradford technique ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) before assays for reporter gene expression .

The Bcel-6 oligonucleotide ( B6BS : 5'-GAAAATTCCTAGAAAG-CATA-3 ' ; donated by Dr Riccardo Dalla-Favera , Columbia University , New York , NY ) has been described . ``
Nuclear extracts were obtained from 5 X 10° Jurkat cells treated without or with IL-4 ( 20 ng/mL for 20 minutes ; Peprotech ) using the method of Schrieber et al . ``
'' EMSAs were performed using 5 ug nuclear protein , 0.8 ug poly ( dG-dC ) ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) , and [ y°P ] end-labeled probe in a final volume of 10 uL per reaction .
Free probes and protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 5 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) with 0.5X TBE .
In antibody experiments , extracts were incubated at room temperature with 1 uL of the following antisera for 30 minutes after the addition of labeled probe : anti-Stat6 ( Santa Cruz Biotech , Santa Cruz , CA ) , N70-6 ( anti-Bel-6* ; donated by Dr Riccardo Dalla-Favera ) , or isotype-matched control antisera .
Recombinant proteins .
- A recombinant fragment of murine NFATp ( including 298 amino acids of the DNA binding domain [ DBD ] that is highly conserved among different NFAT family members ) was expressed as a hexahistidine-tagged protein and extracted as described . ``
The NFATp expression vector was kindly donated by Dr Anjana Rao ( Harvard University ) .
Recombinant full-length , in vitro phosphorylated Stat6 has been described . ``
Statistical analysis .
- All transfections were performed in duplicate using cells of similar passage number .
Average results of the indicated numbers of independent experiments were analyzed using the paired Student 's +test ( Statview II Software ; SAS Institute , San Francisco , CA ) , and a P value less than .05 was considered to be statistically significant .
RESULTS The IL-4R signaling pathway is intact in Jurkat T cells .
To investigate the role of Stat6 in regulating transcription of the intact IL-4 promoter , we studied Jurkat T cells transiently From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .
For personal use only .
Stat6 INHIBITS THE INTERLEUKIN-4 PROMOTER transfected with different IL-4 promoter reporter constructs .
In preliminary experiments , we did not detect immunoreactive Stat6 in nuclear extracts from IL-4-activated Jurkat cells in EMSA , suggesting that the cells used in these experiments express negligible levels of this factor ( not shown ) .
Consistent with this result , IL-4 stimulation alone did not induce a full-length IL-4 promoter construct ( not shown ) or the reporter construct C/EBP-N4 lue ( which contains 4 copies of the IgE C/EBP/Stat6 element driving the firefly luciferase gene ; Fig 2A ) .
However , as previously reported , `` C/EBP-N4 luc was strongly induced by IL-4 in Staté-expressing HepG2 cells ( Fig 2B ) .
To verify that the IL-4R signaling pathway was otherwise functional in Jurkat cells , we first analyzed the inducibility of C/EBP-N4 luc in cells cotransfected with a full-length Stat6 expression vector .
Activity of C/EBP-N4 luc is strongly dependent on the coordinated binding of C/EBP and Stat6 to adjacent sites . ``
'' Figure 2A shows that C/EBP-N4 luc was highly induced by IL-4 in Stat6-expressing Jurkat cells , but not in control cells cotransfected with the corresponding empty vector .
This result confirms the known expression of C/EBP proteins by Jurkat cells . ``
'' Consistent with previous findings , `` C/EBP-N4 lue was induced by IL-4 in HepG2 cells in the absence of exogenous Stat6 ( Fig 2B ) .
Thus , although Jurkat cells do not constitutively express functional Stat6 protein , cotransfected Stat6 is highly induced by IL-4 in these cells .
IgE cs 4531 Stat6 represses transcription driven by the intact IL-4 promoter .
- We next analyzed the ability of Stat6 to transactivate the intact IL-4 promoter .
Figure 3 shows that a full-length human IL-4 promoter construct ( pCAT 265 ) was consistently inhibited by IL-4 in Stat6-cotransfected Jurkat cells .
To determine whether unstimulated Jurkat cells lacked an activation-induced Stat6 cofactor or whether Stat6é needed a further activation signal , which is necessary for IL-4 transcription , we next analyzed the effects of IL-4 in activated cells cotransfected with Stat6 and pCAT 265 .
As previously reported , `` `` `` `` a calcium-dependent signal alone was sufficient to maximally induce the IL-4 promoter ( Fig 3 ) .
PMA downregulated IL-4 promoter activity , which we previously found was due to the displacement of NFATp from the human P1 sequence by induced nuclear NF-kB heterodimers . ``
Interestingly , IL-4 consistently inhibited calcium-induced promoter activity in Stat6-cotransfected cells and almost completely repressed the promoter in combination with PMA ( Fig 4 ) .
Thus , even in conjunction with activation of intracellular calcium and PKC-signaling pathways , Stat6 inhibited transcription driven by the full-length IL-4 promoter .
To map the IL-4 promoter element ( s ) necessary for Stat6-mediated transcriptional repression , we used a smaller promoter construct in additional cotransfection experiments .
This construct ( pCAT 145 ) contains 145 bp of the human promoter , including the P1 and PO NFAT elements , but lacks the previ- Reporter : ( CIEBP-Staté ) |- - A. Jurkat 50,0007 D L IL ' 4 r 50,000 E H + IL-4 = 40,000 |- 40,000 = r-p 39.0001 | 30,000 S o .

Stat6 inhibits transcription driven by the intact IL-4 promoter .

`` ) .
Interestingly , pCAT145 activity was significantly inhibited by IL-4 in both resting and stimulated Stat6 cotransfected cells ( Fig 5 ) .
Importantly , an expression vector encoding a Stat6 DNA binding domain mutant ( TPUS22 , see Materials and Methods ) did not inhibit pCAT145 activity in either resting or activated cells ( Fig 5 , right side ) .
These results suggested that Stat6-induced repression involved binding sites located downstream of the known Stat6 sequence and that the DNA binding ability of Stat6 was required for this effect .
The human IL-4 promoter contains multiple overlapping Stat6 and NFAT binding sites .
- The previously described Stat6 binding site is contained within the P2 NFAT element ( Fig 6 ) .
We and others have shown that this element can support the cooperative binding of NFAT and AP-1 proteins . ``
As shown in Fig 6 , the 3'-half of the Stat6 site ( CGAA®* ) overlaps the 5'-end of the NFAT site ( CGGAA®* ) .
In view of our functional data showing repression of a construct lacking the P2 element ( Fig 5 ) , we speculated that Stat6 could interact with additional P elements from the IL-4 promoter .
To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the ability of recombinant Stat6 to bind similar length oligonucleotides including the five known IL-4 P elements by EMSA .
Figure 7 shows that recombinant Stat6 bound 30-bp oligonucleotides containing the P1 , P2 , and P4 NFAT sites , but not the PO or P3 sites .
Based on sequence homology and mutational analysis ( Fig Stato * p=0.008 vs .

Results are expressed relative to the constitutive activity of pCAT 265 without IL-4 and are the mean + SEM of four independent experiments .
IL-4 significantly downregulated promoter activity only in Staté-cotransfected cells .
6 ) , we predicted that Stat6 and NFAT would bind competitively to overlapping sites in the IL-4 promoter .
To test this hypothesis and to exclude any combinatorial interactions of these factors on the IL-4 promoter , we analyzed the effect of Stat6 on the ability of the NFATp DBD ( see Materials and Methods ) to interact with oligonucleotides containing the P1 and P2 elements in EMSA .
As expected , NFATp readily bound both probes ( Fig 8 ) .
Interestingly , increasing amounts of Stat6 displaced NFATp from its cognate sites on both oligonucleo-tides .
Displacement of NFAT from the P1 element by Stat6 may provide an explanation for the repressive effects of Stat6 on pCAT 145 .
DISCUSSION The molecular basis by which IL-4 induces the production of Th2 cytokines is currently not known .
Experiments with Stat6-deficient mice have conclusively demonstrated a requirement for this IL-4-inducible transcription factor during the differentiation of naive T cells into Th2 cells .
?
However , recent studies have found that activation of the IL-4R-signaling pathway is not required for the induction of IL-4 gene expression in committed Th2 cells .
`` ® `` `` > 4 Additionally , Stat6 can repress IL-4 gene expression in Th1 cells by binding a cell-type specific silencer in the 3 ' untranslated region ( UTR ) .4 Thus , the precise role of Stat6 in regulating IL-4 expression is currently not clear .

factor might provide a direct link between IL-4R activation and IL-4 gene expression .
However , a conclusion of our studies is that Stat6 might only facilitate IL-4 gene expression in T cells in an indirect fashion .
This report , showing for the first time the specific effect of Stat6 on the intact IL-4 promoter , contains several novel observations .
First , we found that , although IL-4 receptor-mediated signals are faithfully transduced in Jurkat T cells ( Fig 2 ) , Stat6 was unable to transactivate the proximal human IL-4 promoter in these cells ( Figs 3 through 5 ) .
Together with previous studies showing that IL-4 can induce multimers of the P2 Stat6 site linked to heterologous promoters , * `` `` our findings suggest that the transactivation potential of Stat6 is dependent on promoter context .
This conclusion is in keeping A Stat6 Probe : PO P1 P2 P3 B NFAT PO _ AATGTAAACTCAITT TTCCETCGGT TCAGC with recent analyses of Stat6 and the germline IgE `` and B-casein genes `` and with the study of Huang et al , `` `` who found that Stat6 differentially regulated multimers of the P2 Stat6 element in M12 B cells depending on the minimal promoter construct used .
Second , we found that transcription driven by two deletion constructs of the human IL-4 promoter was consistently inhibited by IL-4 in Staté-expressing Jurkat T cells .
Interestingly , recent studies suggest that IL-4 can inhibit IL-4 gene expression in a negative feedback fashion .
For example , Morigg !
et al `` found that committed Th2 cells secreted more IL-4 when restimulated with anti-CD3 in the presence of a neutralizing anti-IL-4 MoAb .
Additionally , IL-4 seemed to inhibit anti-CD3-induced transcription driven by the full-length mouse IL-4 Fig 7 .

'' Taken together , these results suggest that activated Stat6é might downregulate IL-4 expression in effector Th cells and emphasize the need to distinguish between Th2 differentiation and IL-4 gene expression ( see below ) .
Third , we have identified two novel Stat6 binding sites ( within the P1 and P4 elements ) in the IL-4 promoter .
Although these sites do not contain the consensus Staté binding site ( 5-TTCN , GAA-3 ' ) defined by binding site selection assays , a significant fraction ( 10/42 ) of sequences selected by Stat6 in these assays contained single nucleotide substitutions within the dyad half-sites . ``
Thus the ability of Stat6 to bind the P1 oligonucleotide ( 5'-TTCN , GTA-3 `` ) is not surprising .
The reason why Stat6 bound the P4 element but not the PO element is -_ P1 element - P2 element less apparent , because they contain similar noncanonical dyad half sites , although they do differ in the spacer region .
Fourth , the demonstration that Staté and NFAT can bind competitively to the IL-4 promoter provides evidence of a previously unreported interaction between these two factors .
Given the fundamental role of NFAT family members in regulating IL-4 gene expression , this observation provides a plausible explanation for the observed inhibitory effects of Stat6 on transcription driven by the IL-4 promoter .
This would be similar to the recently described antagonism of by Stat6 in the E-selectin promoter `` Because the P1 element in particular plays a major role in activating IL-4 transcription , `` competition by Stat6 for NFAT binding to this element might From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

4536 have particularly repressive effects .
Alternatively , we can not exclude the possibility that Stat6é might actively repress the basal transcription complex or that it might also bind to and titrate away from the promoter a factor necessary for maximal IL-4 transcription .
Stat6 might require a coactivator not expressed by Jurkat cells to maximally transactivate the IL-4 promoter .
For example , Stat6 cooperates with both C/EBP and NF-kB/Rel proteins `` to promote germline IgE transcription .
The fact that C/EBP-N4 luc is highly induced ( Fig 2 ) argues that the inability of Stat6 to activate IL-4 transcription in our experiments is not due to the lack of C/EBP proteins and confirms the known expression of C/EBP in Jurkat cells . ``
Additionally , we have shown that PMA-activated Jurkat cells contain abundant nuclear We can not formally exclude the requirement for as yet unidentified Stat6 coactivators necessary for IL-4 transcription , although the studies by Huang et al `` `` argue against the existence of such factors in a differentiated Th2 clone .
Another possibility is that Stat6 might require additional posttranslational modification to achieve full transcriptional competency in Jurkat cells .
However , the observations that ( 1 ) PMA enhanced the repressive effects of Stat6 ( Fig 4 ) and ( 2 ) C/EBP-N4 lue was inducible by IL-4 in Stat6-cotransfected Jurkat cells ( Fig 2 ) argue against this explanation .
Finally , it is possible that other factors inhibit the transactivation potential of Stat6 on the IL-4 promoter .
For example , it has recently been suggested that Bel-6 , a transcriptional repressor deregulated in many lymphomas , `` can specifically inhibit the ability of Stat6 to transactivate gene expression .
In fact , Bcl-6-deficient mice were found to have enhanced IL-4 production and Th2 responses . ``
'' To exclude the possibility that Bel-6 was inhibiting transactivation of the IL-4 promoter by Stat6 in Jurkat cells , we assayed for Bcl-6 binding to both the P2 element and a consensus Bel-6 site using Jurkat nuclear extracts in EMSA .
Using conditions known to support Bel-6 binding , `` we did not detect Bel-6 using two specific antisera ( not shown ) .
Additionally , IL-4 gene expression was not inhibited in Jurkat cells expressing inducible Bel-6 protein ( Dr Riccardo Dalla-Favera , personal communication , Spring 1998 ) .
Thus , we conclude that the inability of Stat6 to activate IL-4 transcription in Jurkat T cells is not due to the presence of the specific Stat6 antagonist Bel-6 .
The IL-4R transduces other signals in addition to the Jak-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 .
For example , the I4R motif of the IL-4Ra subunit leads to the IRS-1-dependent phosphorylation of the nonhistone chromosomal protein HMGI/Y . ``
' Phosphorylation of HMGI/Y in B cells inhibits its ability to bind DNA and results in the derepression of germline IgE transcription . ``
HMGI/Y has recently been shown to downregulate the IL-4 promoter by competing with NFAT for binding to the P1 element . ``
Thus , activation of this IL-4R signaling pathway would be expected to de-repress the IL-4 promoter .
However , our observation that Stat6 also displaces NFAT from the P1 element ( Fig 8 ) might explain why this did not occur in our experiments .
It is worth emphasizing that IL-4-dependent differentiation of naive Th cells into effector Th2 cells involves prolonged GEORAS ET AL exposure to multiple concomitant signals emanating from the T-cell receptor , costimulatory molecules , and possibly other APC-derived cytokines .
`` * `` ° The precise role of Stat6 in this process requires further study .
We have shown that Stat6 does not directly transactivate the IL-4 promoter , which it actually represses in cells transcribing the IL-4 gene .
Together with recent analyses of committed Th cells , `` * `` `` our results suggest that Stat6 may rather facilitate the acquisition of an IL-4-producing phenotype in differentiating Th cells in an indirect fashion .
In this regard , investigating the regulation of other lineage-specific Th2 transcription factors by Staté may be helpful .
