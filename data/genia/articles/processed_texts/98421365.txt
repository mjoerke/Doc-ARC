RAPID COMMUNICATION A Novel Mutation in the Coding Sequence of the FY*B Allele of the Duffy Chemokine Receptor Gene Is Associated With an Altered Erythrocyte Phenotype By Niva Parasol , Marion Reid , Maria Rios , Lilian Castilho , lana Harari , and Nechama S. Kosower The Duffy blood group system is of clinical and biological significance .
Antibodies to Duffy antigens are responsible for some cases of transfusion incompatibility and newborn hemolytic disease .
The Duffy protein is a receptor for the Plasmodium vivax erythrocyte-binding protein and is also a receptor for various chemokines ( thus renamed Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines [ DARC ] ) .
The two Duffy polymorphic antigens , Fy*® and Fy `` ( coded by the FY* A and FY*B alleles ) , are present on erythrocyte membranes .
The Fy ( a-b- ) phenotype is the predominant one in populations of black people and also occurs in other populations , including some non-Ashkenazi Jewish groups .
The Fy ( a-b- ) phenotype has been associated with a mutation in the FY*B promoter at the GATA box that abolishes the expression of erythrocyte Duffy protein .
We describe here a novel muta- HE DUFFY BLOOD GROUP system is significant in humans , and novel mutations with functional conse-quences , such as the one we report here , are of considerable interest .
The two Duffy polymorphic antigens , Fy® and Fy® , are carried on proteins produced by the Duffy gene alleles FY*A and FY*B .
The antisera , anti-Fy* and anti-Fy® , define four major erythrocyte Duffy phenotypes : Fy ( a+b- ) , Fy ( a-b+ ) , b+ ) , and Fy ( a-b- ) . '
> The Fy ( a-b- ) phenotype is rare among white and Asian populations , whereas it is the predominant phenotype among populations of black people , especially those originating in West Africa . ``
The gene , the first one to be assigned to a specific autosome , `` has been mapped to 1422-23 . ``
The gene has been cloned and sequenced® and shown to have two exons . ``
The FY*A and FY*B alleles differ by a single-base substitution at nucleotide 131 of the cDNA ( A in FY*B and G in FY*A ) , resulting in a polymorphism at amino acid residue 44 , with aspartic acid ( Asp ) in Fy® and glycine ( Gly ) in Fy # ®.° ( The numbering of nucleotides and amino acid residues used here is according to the cDNA and predicted protein sequence based on a single exon published by Chaudhuri et al .
The amino acid 44 cited here would be amino acid 42 , as predicted by Iwamoto et al , `` based on a spliced transcript of two exons . )
The presence of guanine at this site generates a Ban I restriction site in FY*A , thus allowing the identification of FY*A and FY*B by Ban I restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) .
* !
° A substitution of T to C at the GATA box of the FY*B promoter ( -46T - C ) ( based on numbering by Tournamille et al `` ) has been found in Fy ( a-b- ) black individuals . ``
This mutation disrupts the binding site for the GATA-1 erythroid transcription factor , results in a silent FY*B allele in erythroid cells , and is considered to be responsible for most cases of Fy ( a-b- ) erythrocytes in the black populations .
`` !
The GATA mutation generates a Sty I restriction site , allowing the identification of this mutation by RFLP . ``
The Duffy gene product is a transmembrane glycoprotein of 35 to 43 kD .
The Duffy antigens are important in transfusion incompatibility and hemolytic disease of the newborn .
In addition , the Duffy protein is a receptor for the erythrocyte-binding protein of Plasmodium vivax ; the resistance in West Blood , Vol 92 , No 7 ( October 1 ) , 1998 : pp 2237-2243 tion , present in the FY* B coding sequence ( 2710 - T ) , that is associated with some Fy ( b- ) phenotypes among non-Ashkenazi Jew s and among Brazilian blacks .
The mutation is present in Fy ( b- ) individuals , who have wild-type FY*B GATA and carry the previously described 304G - A substitu-tion .
The 271C - T and 304G - A can be identified by restriction enzyme-generated restriction fragment length polymorphisms .
The 271C - T substitution represents a considerable change in chemical nature ( Arg91 - Cys ) , one which may affect the antigenic determinants of DARC , and thus be of clinical significance .
The mutation may have implications for some physiological roles of DARC and be of interest in malaria research and in studies of population genetics .
© 1998 by The American Society of Hematology .
African populations to infection by P vivax malarial parasites has been attributed to the high incidence of Fy ( a-b- ) in these populations . ``
The Duffy protein has also been identified as a receptor for various chemokines and renamed as Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines ( DARC ) .
DARC is expressed in various tissues , where it has been identified in endothelial cells lining postcapillary venules .
It has also been identified in cerebellar Purkinje cells .
DARC may have important physiological functions in homeostatic processes in some brain regions and in processes involving inflammatory chemokines .
!
924 Several examples of erythrocytes have been described that exhibit weak reactivity with some anti-Fy® sera , and no reactivity with others , thereby giving apparent discrepancies between the Fy® phenotype and genotype .

2238 sample was found to be FY*B/FY*B as determined by Ban I RFLP , and only heterozygous for the mutation at the GATA box , as identified by Sty I RFLP . ``
DNA sequencing showed two mutations in the coding sequence , a novel mutation at nucleotide ( nt ) 271 from C to T ( 271C - T ) , and the previously reported mutation at nt 304 from G to A ( 304 G - A ) .8 Subsequently , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -RFLP assays were established to screen for these mutations .
As described here , the simultaneous presence of these two mutations resulted in the silencing of the Fy `` antigen in erythrocytes .
This phenomenon is of clinical significance and may have implications for physiological roles of DARC in tissues other than erythrocytes , and it may be of interest in studies of population genetics .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Phenotyping of erythrocyte Duffy antigens .
Blood samples were from donors whose identity was unknown ( unlinked ) .
The Fy ( b- ) samples were selected based on routine phenotyping of washed erythrocytes with anti-Fy* and anti-Fy® used according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Erythrocytes from the non-Ashkenazi Jews in Israel were tested with antiserum from Gamma Biologicals Inc ( Houston , TX ) .
Erythrocytes from Brazilian blacks were tested with antisera from three companies ( Gamma Biologicals Inc ; Biotest-Sio Paulo , Brazil ; and Dia Med , Cressier sur Morat , Switzerland ) .
It should be noted that the serological testing used here does not distinguish between Fy ( a-b- ) and Fy ( a-b `` *** ) erythrocyte phenotypes .
Fy ( a-b `` **** ) erythrocytes often type as Fy ( a-b- ) if only the usual anti-Fy® are used by routine methods .
Further testing with a variety of anti-Fy® reagents as well as a quantitative adsorption and elution analysis have to be performed on erythrocytes identified as Fy ( b- ) by standard agglutination assays , to characterize such samples .
DNA was prepared at the time of Fy® testing and by the time that analysis of DNA showed the mutations described here , erythrocytes were not available for further testing .
DNA preparation .
White blood cells ( WBCs ) from whole blood were obtained after erythrocyte lysis with a solution containing 155 mmol/L NH , Cl , 10 mmol/L KHCOs , and 1.0 mmol/L Na ; -EDTA .
The washed pellets were suspended in buffer containing 10 mmol/L Tris-HCI ] , pH 7.5 , 75 mmol/L NaCl , 24 mmol/L EDTA , 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , and 150 ug proteinase K/mL , and kept for 4 hours at 55°C .
Proteins were precipitated by salting out , using saturated NaCl solution , vigorous mixing , and centrifugation .
'* The supernatants were mixed with cold ethanol .
The precipitated DNA was solubilized in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCI , pH 7.5 , 1.0 mmol/L EDTA .
Alternatively , WBC DNA was extracted using DNAzo !
Kit ( GIBCO-BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) , according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
The DNA solutions were analyzed for quality by agarose gel electrophoresis and for quantity by optical density measurements at 260 nm .
DNA amplification .
PCR was performed using 100 to 200 ng of DNA , 3 pmol of each primer , 2 nmol of each dNTP , 1.0 U Taq polymerase and buffer ( Perkin Elmer , Norwalk , CT ) , in a total volume of 40 uL .
The primers used for PCR amplification , FY3 , 5'-CCCTCTTGTGTCCCTCCCTTT , located at -276 - -256 , and FY4 , 5-CAGAGCTGCGAGTGCTACCTA , located at 385 - 365 , were designed to encompass the coding region containing nt 131 ( site for FY*A/FY*B polymorphism® `` © ) , nt 271 ( site of novel mutation described here ) , and nt 304 ( site of mutation previously described* `` `` ) .
Reactions were performed in an automated thermal cycler ( PTC 100 MJ Research , Watertown , MA ) , with denaturation at 94°C for 4 minutes , followed by 30 cycles of amplification ( 94°C , 1 minute ; 60°C , 1 minute ; 72°C , 1 minute ) and a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes .
A second PCR amplification of a DNA segment containing the GATA mutation PARASOL ET AL site ( nt -46 ) was performed using the published conditions and primers P38 and P39 ( here named FY1 and FY2 ) .
RFLP analysis of PCR products .
- The restriction enzymes , buffers , and details for their use were supplied by New England BioLabs ( Beverly , MA ) .
For the identification of FY*A and FY*B , 15 uL of the PCR product ( DNA amplified by the FY3 and FY4 primers ) was digested with Ban I .
The restriction fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on 1 % agarose gel .
For the identification of the GATA mutation , 25 uL of the PCR product ( DNA amplified by the FY1 and FY2 primers ) was digested with Sty I , followed by electrophoresis on 12 % acrylamide gel .
For the identification of the 271C - > T mutation , 10 uL of the PCR product ( DNA amplified by the FY3 and FY4 primers ) was digested with Act I , and for the identification of the 304G - A mutation , 10 uL of the same PCR product was digested with Mwo I .
The restriction fragments were resolved on 1 % agarose gel .
Nucleotide sequence analysis .
- The PCR-amplified fragments were sequenced on both strands by thermocycling sequencing with automatic 377 DNA sequencer ( Perkin Elmer ) .
For the initial sample that showed the discrepancy between the phenotype and genotype determined by Ban | and Sty I [ phenotype Fy ( a-b- ) , and genotype FY*B/FY*B-46T - C , ie , being only heterozygous for the GATA mutation ] , sequencing was carried out between nt -276 to nt 1944 , on overlapping DNA fragments , amplified by several primers .
After the identification of the 271C - T and 304G - A mutations , other samples were sequenced using FY3 for the PCR products generated by FY3 and FY4 .
RESULTS Alleles FY*A and FY*B in Fy ( b- ) phenotypes among non-Ashkenazi Jews .
- Although the phenotype Fy ( a-b- ) is known to be present in about 20 % of Jews from Yemen and has also been observed among other non-Ashkenazi Jews , '* `` there is no published information on the genotypes among these ethnic groups .
Using the Ban I RFLP for the identification of the FY*A and FY*B alleles , `` we analyzed the DNA samples of unrelated individuals having Fy ( a-b- ) and Fy ( a+ b- ) phenotypes ( Fig 1 ) .
Among the Fy ( a+b- ) phenotypes , we found FY*A/FY*A ( lanes 4 , 6 , and 7 ) and FY*A/FY*B ( lanes 3 and 9 ) ; the Fy ( a-b- ) phenotypes were found to be FY*B/FY*B ( lanes 5 , 8 , and 10 ) .
The Ban I restriction patterns of the PCR products indicate that the FY*B allele is the silent one in the Fy ( a-b- ) samples from non-Ashkenazi Jews , as is the case for the Fy ( a-b- ) phenotypes in the black populations .
! ``
The GATA mutation in Fy ( b- ) , FY*B non-Ashkenazi Jews .
To determine whether the GATA mutation , identified in the Fy ( a-b- ) black population , `` `` was associated with the Fy ( b- ) phenotype among the non-Ashkenazi Jews , Sty I RFLP `` were performed on PCR-amplified genomic DNA from samples of Fy ( a-b- ) FY*B/FY*B , Fy ( a+b- ) FY*A/FY*A , and Fy ( a+b- ) FY*A/FY*B ( genotypes as identified by Ban I ) .
As can be seen in Fig 2 , the Sty I RFLP identifies samples that are homozygous and heterozygous for the mutation , with several samples that exhibit discrepancy between their phenotypes and genotypes , as determined by Ban I and Sty I RFLPs ( genotypes of samples shown in lanes 1 , 2 , 4 , and 7 corresponded to their phenotypes ; genotypes of samples shown in lanes 3 , 5 , and 6 did not correspond to their phenotypes ) .
As shown in Table 1 , among 16 Fy ( b- ) individuals , the genotype corresponded to the phenotype in 12 ; 6 individuals were Fy ( a-b- ) , FY*B/ FY*B by Ban I and homozygous for the GATA mutation ; 4 individuals were Fy ( a+ b- ) , FY*A/FY*B by Ban I and heterozygous for the GATA mutation ; and 2 were Fy ( a+b- ) , From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

sequence , as compared with the sequence of the wild FY*B allele . ``
The first one was a novel mutation of C - T at nucleotide 271 ( 271€C - T ) and the second one was a previously described mutation of G - A at nucleotide 304 ( 304G - A ) . ``
Based on these mutations , PCR-RFLP were developed for the identification of the mutations , Act I RFLP for 271C - T ( Fig 3 ) and Mwo I RFLP for 304G - A ( Fig 4 ) .
As can be seen in Table 1 , all four individuals , whose GATA genotypes did not correspond to their phenotypes were found to be heterozygous for both mutations .
The mutations detected by RFLP using Aci I and Mwo I were further confirmed by sequencing the PCR-amplified DNA of these samples .
The simultaneous presence of the 271C - T and 304G - A in the discordant cases implies that these mutations are responsible for some cases of Fy ( b- ) , wild-type GATA erythrocytes among Fy ( b- ) non-Ashkenazi Jews .
A Acil l PARASOL ET AL Identification of the 2710 - T and 304G - A mutations among Brazilian black Fy ( b- ) individuals .
Thirty-four Fy ( a-b- ) and 15 Fy ( a+b- ) samples from Brazilian black people were analyzed for FY*A and FY*B alleles , using the Ban I RFLP .
As shown in Table 2 , all Fy ( a-b- ) phenotypes were homozygous for the FY*B allele .
Among the Fy ( a+b- ) , 3 were homozygous for FY*A and 12 were heterozygous , FY*A/FY*B .
These results correspond to those observed in other studies on black populations , ?
in which homozygosity for the FY*B allele was found in Fy ( a-b- ) , and homozygosity for FY*A or heterozygosity for FY*A/FY*B was shown in Fy ( a+b- ) , as determined by Ban I RFLP .
Analysis of the 49 samples with Sty I showed that 33 Fy ( a-b- ) FY*B/ FY*B were homozygous for the GATA mutation ; thus , their phenotype can be accounted for by the GATA mutation .
One Fy ( a-b- ) FY*B/ FY*B individual was heterozygous for the GATA mutation , thus showing a discrepancy between his phenotype and genotype .
Among the 15 Fy ( a+b- ) individuals , the FY and GATA genotypes corresponded to their phenotypes in 12 : as expected , the three Fy ( a+b- ) FY*A/FY*A had the wild-type GATA and 9 Fy ( a+b- ) FY*A/FY*B were heterozygous for the GATA mutation .
In contrast , in three individuals , who were Fy ( a+b- ) FY*A/FY*B , wild-type GATA was found .
Thus , in four individuals of the 49 analyzed , their Duffy phenotypes and genotypes could not be explained by FY and GATA genotyping .
RFLP analysis by Aci I and Mwo I showed that all four individuals were heterozygous for both the 271C - T mutation and the 304G - A mutation .
These two mutations were not found in the other 45 Fy ( b- ) individuals , in whom the genotype 271 wild type 164 bp | 139 bp 242 bp |116 bp 271 mutant ( C -- > T ) 164 bp | 139 bp 358 bp Fig 3 .

These results show that , as in non-Ashkenazi Jews , an FY*B mutation different from the common GATA mutation in black populations is also associated with some Fy ( b- ) phenotypes among the Brazilian blacks .
The findings indicate that the presence of both mutations result in an Fy ( b- ) phenotype .
DISCUSSION We describe here a novel mutation in the FY*B allele of the Duffy chemokine receptor gene .
This mutation , together with a previously described mutation , results in erythrocyte Fy ( b- ) phenotype as identified by standard agglutination assays ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The phenotype Fy ( a-b- ) , similarly identified by standard reagents , is present in about 70 % of both American blacks `` and Brazilian blacks , `` `` and is also present in non-Ashkenazi Jews , notably in about 20 % of Yemenite Jews . ``
'' The promoter GATA mutation in the FY*B allele `` accounts for the Fy ( b- ) phenotype among African black populations .
* `` 2 As is shown here , the same mutation is prevalent among the Brazilian blacks and is also found in the FY*B allele among Table 2 .

However , in some individuals there appeared to be a discrepancy between their Fy ( b- ) phenotype and genotype , with a discordant FY*B allele having the promoter wild-type GATA .
In these individuals , two mutations in the coding sequence ( 271C - T and 304G - A ) were found in the discordant FY*B allele .
Both mutations were identified among the Fy ( b- ) FY*B non-Ashkenazi Jews and among the Brazilian blacks , suggesting an association with FY*B gene silencing in erythroid cells .
The 304G - A mutation , which codes for Ala - Thr at amino acid residue 102 , has been previously described in a study using reverse transcriptase ( RT ) -PCR of placental RNA as a source for cloning and sequencing of the Duffy gene . ``
In another study , the same mutation was found in Fy ( a+ b+ ) and Fy ( a+ b- ) samples . ``
Based on these studies , the 304G - A mutation may be a polymorphic one , as has been suggested .
`` ?
Further studies are required to establish whether 304G - A is a polymorphic mutation , whether the 271C - T mutation occurred in this variant and whether the expression of both is necessary for the Fy ( b- ) phenotype .
It is of interest to note that according to the proposed three-dimensional structure of DARC ( involving seven transmembrane segments ) , `` the amino acid 102 ( amino acid residue according to Chaudhuri et al `` ; residue 100 according to Iwamoto et al `` ) would be in the second transmembrane segment , and a substitution of Ala - Thr might not lead to more than a modest change in receptor properties The 271€C - T mutation , on the other hand , converts the residue 91 ( amino acid residue according to Chaudhuri et al `` ; residue 89 according to Iwamoto et al `` ) , assumed to be in the first cytoplasmic loop , from Arg - Cys .
This substitution represents a considerable change in the chemical nature of the local region and may affect the behavior of DARC and its extracellular antigenic sites .
The finding that a combination of two mutations within the From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .
For personal use only .
2242 coding sequence may result in an apparent erythrocyte Fy ( b- ) phenotype raises several important questions .
The promoter GATA substitution , which impairs the binding site of the erythroid transcription factor and results in a silent erythroid FY*B allele and lack of erythrocyte Duffy receptor , does not affect the expression of the gene in other cells .
! ``
It is not known at present whether the DARC Arg91 - Cys , Ala102 Thr mutant protein is present in the erythrocyte membranes .
The point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions would be expected to allow the expression of the protein , albeit in a possibly altered conformation and altered ligand-binding prop-erties .
However , it can not be excluded that such mutations result in a deficiency or absence of the protein ( eg , due to failure of being incorporated into the cell membrane , or being susceptible to degradation ) .
It would be of interest to study whether this DARC mutant is fully or partially expressed in or absent from erythrocytes and from other cells .
In addition , because the spliced transcript may normally be the predominant one , `` it may be relevant to find out whether there is any preferential effect on the expression of one of the two transcripts `` in the mutant cells .
In any case , the overall phenotype of the mutant described here is expected to be different from the GATA mutation , because both the erythrocytes and other DARC expressing cells would be affected by mutations in the coding sequence that alter the expression and/or ligand-binding properties of the protein .
Additional studies on the binding of a variety of anti-Fy `` ® , including quantitative titrations of antibody binding , are necessary to determine whether the mutant erythrocytes described here behave as a Fy ( b**** ) variant .
It may be important to define the properties of the mutant erythrocytes and other DARC-expressing cells for binding malarial parasites and chemokines .
It should also be pointed out that chemokine binding to DARC has characteristics different from those of antibody binding , `` and that differences exist among various chemokines in their interaction with DARC . ``
'' Thus , DARC mutant erythrocytes that do not bind anti-Fy `` may nevertheless react with chemokines .
Although the precise roles of DARC in various tissues are not known at present , the properties of a mutant such as the one described here may be of physiological significance .
In view of the importance of Duffy blood group system in clinical medicine , eg , in cases of transfusion incompatibility and hemolytic disease of the new born , *** in forensic medicine , and in malaria epidemiology , screening procedures are being developed for detection of the known common variants and mutations .
`` * `` `` The restriction enzyme-generated RFLPs described here provide a means for screening samples for the 271C - T and the 304G - A .
Screening for these mutations in samples identified as Fy ( b- ) and Fy ( b `` *** ) phenotypes would be important both for clinical purposes and for population genetic studies .
