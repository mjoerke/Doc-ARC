The distribution of this integral membrane protein is restricted to certain tissues where its level of expression is modulated by multiple exogenous stimuli .
To identify the molecular basis for specificity and inducibility , the chromatin configuration of the human B7.1 gene was examined in intact nuclei from various cell types .
The identification of a tissue-specific deoxyribo-nuclease I hypersensitive site ~3kb upstream of the transcription start site led to the characterization of a cell type-specific enhancer region .
This 183-bp region was both cell type specific and responsive to two distinct stimuli , lipopolysaccharide and dibutyryl cAMP , known to regulate B7.1 expression .
Deletional and site-directed mutagenesis revealed the presence of multiple functionally critical cis elements within this region , one of which was a nuclear factor ( NF ) -kB consensus sequence .
In B7.1-positive B cells , this element bound several members of the NF-KB family , transcription factors already implicated in signal transduction pathways relevant to B7.1 expression .
This is the first description , to our knowledge , of regulatory elements that control expression of a gene encoding a B7 costimulatory molecule .
ffective activation of T lymphocytes requires two sig- nals from APCs ( for a review see reference 1 ) .
The first signal is delivered upon the binding of the clonally distributed TCR to MHC-foreign antigen complexes on APCs .
This interaction results in the phosphorylation of cellular tyrosine kinases and the induction of gene expression ( 2 , 3 ) .
The second signal is provided by the interaction of costimulatory molecules on T cells with their ligands on APCs ( 4 ) .
The delivery of signal one in the absence of signal two can lead to T cell paralysis or anergy ( 5-7 ) .
Of the known costimulatory molecules , the B7 family of proteins is arguably the most potent .
This family consists of at least two members , B7.1 ( CD80 ) ( 8 ) and B7.2 ( CD86 ) ( 9-11 ) , which interact with similar affinity with their coun-terreceptors , CD28 and CTLA4 , on T cells , although their affinity for CTLA4 is substantially greater than for CD28 ( 12 , 13 ) .
Blocking the interaction of the B7 molecules by excess soluble CTLA4 during T cell activation leads to hyporesponsiveness ( 14 ) .
Not surprisingly , B7.1-deficient mice have substantially reduced immune responses ( 15 ) .
Blockade of B7.1 by mAb injection leads to amelioration of autoimmune experimental allergic encephalitis , a murine model of multiple sclerosis ( 16 ) , and prevents xenograft rejection ( 17 ) .
The B7.1 and B7.2 molecules have similar but not iden- tical tissue distribution patterns .
Both proteins are expressed on dendritic cells , and B7.1 is expressed on activated but not resting T cells ( 18 , 19 ) .
Resting B cells express low levels of B7.2 but not B7.1 whereas upon activation , B cells express substantial levels of both proteins ( 10 , 20 ) .
Similarly , macrophages constitutively express B7.2 and can be induced to express higher levels of B7 proteins upon IFN-y treatment ( 21 ) .
In general , in mice , cell surface B7.2 levels are higher than B7.1 levels , and the kinetics of induction of B7.2 are faster than those of B7.1 ( 22 , 23 ) .
A large number of stimuli can induce B7.1 expression on resting , surface-negative B cells , These include the cytokine IL-4 ( 24 ) , Abs to the B cell Ig receptor ( 23 ) , ligation of the B cell activation molecule CD40 ( 25 ) , the mitogens LPS and dextran sulfate ( 23 ) , transformation by EBV ( 26 ) , and agents that activate protein kinase A , such as dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( db-cAMP ) !
( 27 , 28 ) .
Since resting B cells do not contain detectable transcripts for B7.1 , it is likely that such induction occurs primarily at the transcriptional level .
Similarly , B7.1-negative monocytes become B7.1 positive Abbreviations used in this paper : db-cAMP , dibutyl cyclic AMP ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; HTLV-1 , human T cell leukemia virus type-1 ; NF-KB , nuclear factor « B ; NIB , nuclear isolation buffer ; tk , thymidine kinase .

© The Rockefeller University Press « 0022-1007/96/03/777/13 $ 2.00 Volume 183 March 1996 777-789 after treatment with IFN-y ( 29 ) , as do resting T cells upon activation by antigen or transformation by human T cell leukemia virus type-1 ( HTLV-1 ) ( 26 ) .
Many of these stimuli have been shown to activate the nuclear factor ( NF ) B transcription factor in other systems .
The cDNAs encoding both human and mouse B7.1 genes have been isolated ( 8 , 30 ) .
Using the human cDNA as probe , four transcripts sized 1.7 , 2.9 , 4.2 , and 10 kb were detected in normal and neoplastic B cells .
The 2.9 kb transcript was the major species in anti-Ig-activated B cells whereas the 1.7-kb transcript predominated in B tumor cell lines , such as the Raji cell line ( 30 ) .
In the mouse , three transcripts , 2.2 , 3.9 , and 10 kb were detected in spleen and transformed B cells ( 8 ) .
The molecular basis for the variation in transcript lengths has not been determined .
The genomic organization of both the human and mouse genes has also been reported ( 31 , 32 ) .
In humans , the B7.1 locus spans ~32 kb .
A primer extension analysis of mRNAs from Raji and CH1 B cells has shown that transcription of both human and mouse B7.1 initiates within about 60 nucleotides upstream of the 5 `` end of the existing cDNA clones ( 31 , 32 ) .
However , no obvious promoter elements were observed in the 5 ' flanking region abutting the putative transcription start sites .
Recently , Bortielio et al .
( 33 ) used RACE ( 5 reverse amplification cDNA ends ) on RNA isolated from CH1 B cells to extend the 5 `` end of the previously published mB7.1 cDNA by 1.5 kb , suggesting that an additional 5 ' untranslated sequence may account for the variation in transcript length .
In this report , we describe the analysis of the human B7.1 promoter .
We provide evidence for an enhancer region located ~3 kb upstream of the first exon which determines both cell type specificity and inducibility by certain stimuli .
Linker-scanning mutagenesis of this region revealed the presence of a NF-KB consensus binding site and several additional sites whose integrity was critical for enhancer function .
Materials and Methods Isolation , Cloning , and Sequencing of the 5° Flanking Region of the B7.1 Gene .
A full-length human B7.1 cDNA was used to screen a leukocyte genomic DNA library in A EMBL-3 ( a gift of Dr. S. Orkin , Children 's Hospital , Boston , MA ) ( 34 ) .
The screening procedure was as described ( 35 ) .
The DNA from 10 positive clones was prepared , digested with restriction endonucleases , and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis .
The separated DNA fragments were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and probed with P-labeled oligonucleotides representing sequences derived from different domains of the B7.1 gene .
The procedures of prehybrid-ization , hybridization , and washing of filters were as described ( 30 ) .
One clone , AUT-1 , hybridized to probes from the first and second exons of the B7.1 gene .
The DNA of this clone was further mapped by digestion with restriction endonucleases , and various subfragments recovered from agarose gels were subcloned into pBluescript KS ( Stratagene Inc. , La Jolla , CA ) .
A 3.3-kb Sacl subclone containing the first exon was used to generate a series of nested deletions using the Erase-a-Base kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
The overlapping deletion clones were sequenced on both 778 Regulation of the B7.1 Gene strands using dye-labeled terminator/Taq polymerase chemistry and analyzed on an automated fluorescence DNA sequencer ( Ap-plied Biosystems , Inc. , Foster City , CA ) .
In addition , a 2.4-kb BamHI-Sacl fragment was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination/extension method ( 36 ) and Sequenase ( United States Biochemical Corp. , Cleveland , OH ) using B7.1-specific oligonucleotide primers .
The sequence was analyzed with the Genetic Computer Group ( GCG ) package ( 37 ) and compared with those in the GenBank database .
Cell Lines .
- Human EBV-transformed B cell lines BL30 , EBV5 , and SKW were obtained from Dr. J. Fingeroth ( Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ) , the Nalm6-transformed pre-B cell line was provided by Dr. J. Ritz ( Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ) , and the BA cell line came from Dr. S. Lederman ( Columbia University , New York ) .
Other human cell lines , including the epitheloid carcinoma HeLa , the hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 , the leukemic T cell line Jurkat , the small cell lung carcinoma NCI-H146 , the Burkitt lymphoma Raji and EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma Ramos , and the mouse myeloid cell line M1 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) .
The human fibroblast GMO00637 was obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research ( Camden , NJ ) .
M12.4.1 is a BALB/c B lymphoma cell ( 38 ) .
Hela , HepG2 , and GMO00637 were grown in DME , and all other cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.3 .
All culture media were supplemented with 8 % heat-inactivated FCS ( HyClone Laboratories , Inc. , Logan , UT ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 pg/ml streptomycin , and 50 wM 2-ME .
The culture medium for M1 also contained 100 pM nonessential amino acids .
Abs and Flow Cytometry .
- Anti-hB7.1 mAb 133 ( mouse IgM ) ( 39 ) and anti-mB7.1 mAb 1G10 ( rat IgG2a ) ( 27 ) have been described previously .
The mAbs MIgM , « and RigG2a , « were purchased from PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) and used as isotype-matched control Abs for human or mouse cells , respectively .
Flow cytometry analysis was carried out as described .
Briefly , 5 X 10° cells were incubated with either control Ab or anti-B7.1 mAb at 4°C in HBSS containing 3 % BSA and 0.1 % NaN , .
After wash-ing , the human and mouse cells were stained with FITC-conju-gated goat anti-mouse IgM ( Tago , Inc. , Burlingame , CA ) or FITC goat anti-rat IgG ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc. , Gaithersburg , MD ) , respectively .
The analysis of the cells was performed on a FACS® analyzer ( Becton Dickinson & Co. , Mountain View , CA ) .
DNase I Hypersensitive Site Mapping .
- Isolation and DNase I digestion of nuclei were performed as described ( 40 ) .
Briefly , 10° cells in log phase were harvested , washed with PBS , and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold nuclear isolation buffer ( NIB ) ( 15 mM Tris , pH 7.6 , 60 mM KCI , 15 mM NaCl , 300 mM sucrose , 5 mM MgC ) , and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] } ) containing 0.4 % NP-40 .
Cells were permeablized for 5 min on ice and centrifuged at 3,000 g for 5 min .
Nuclei collected were resuspended in 0.5 tl of NIB and aliquoted into five tubes containing 100 pl of NIB plus 0-5 pug of DNase I .
After 4 min at room tempera-ture , the reactions were stopped by addition of 250 pl of stop solution ( 63 mM Tris , pH 8 , 2.5 mM EDTA and 1.25 % SDS ) and 50 pul of proteinase K ( 5 mg/ml ) .
The lysates were incubated overnight at 37°C and proteins were removed by phenol/chloro-form extraction .
The genomic DNAs isolated were digested by BamHI , Sacl , or Xhol and separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels .
The gels were blotted and hybridized to a P-labeled 295-bp Scal-BamHI probe , spanning exon 1 of the hB7.1 gene ( see Fig .
3 ) .
Expression Plasmid Construction .
The 3.3-kb Sacl and 5-kb BamHI fragments containing the first exon of the B7 .
1 gene were released from pBluescript clones and purified from agarose gels .
These fragments were inserted into pSyncatl , an expression vector containing a promoterless CAT reporter gene ( SynapSys , Bur-lington , MA ) .
Similarly , the 5-kb BamHI fragment and a 2.8-kb EcoRI fragment containing the DH site B ( see Fig .
1 ) were isolated and inserted into pSyncatHII , a vector that contains the minimal herpes virus thymidine kinase ( tk ) promoter upstream of the CAT reporter gene .
Subsequently , these clones were digested with a variety of restriction enzymes to systematically remove different parts of the larger fragments .
Subclones of the shorter B7.1 DNA fragments were regenerated by ligation of blunted ends .
Transient Transfections , Induction , and CAT Assays .
- Raji B cells were transfected by electroporation using an electroporator ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) as described ( 41 ) .
HeLa cells were transfected using the standard calcium phosphate technique ( 42 ) .
Transfections of BA B cells and Jurkat T cells were performed using DEAE-dextran as described ( 43 ) .
Briefly , 10 `` cells were washed in STBS ( 25 mM Tris , pH 7.4 , 137 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCI , 0.6 mM Na , HPO , , 0.7 mM CaCl , , and 0.5 mM MgCl ) and resuspended in 1 ml of DEAE-dextran ( 200 pg/ml ) plus 6 ug of plasmid DNA .
Cells were treated with DEAE-dextran/DNA mixture at room temperature for 30 min , washed once with complete medium , and plated .
Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection .
M12.4.1 ( abbreviated as M12 hereafter ) B cells and M1 myeloid cells were transfected using an alternative DEAE-dextran method as previously described ( 38 ) .
Transfected cells were split equally into two sets of plates and incubated for 24 h. db-cAMP and LPS ( both from Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) were added to appropriate plates of M12 cells at 30 and 5 pg/ml , respectively .
M1 cells were treated with LPS at 10 ng/ml .
Cells were harvested at 18 h after db-cAMP treatment or at 24 h after LPS stimulation .
Protein concentration of cell extracts was measured by a protein assay kit ( Bio-Rad Laboratories ) .
Equal amounts of protein were used in CAT assays and CAT activity was measured using thin-layer chromatography and liquid scintillation counting .
CAT activities of hB7.1 DNA transfections are expressed as fold increase over those of the vector DNA transfections , which were arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.0 .
All transfections were repeated three times unless otherwise specified .
The NF-KB p50 and p65 expression constructs were the gift of Dr. R. Sen ( Brandeis University , Waltham , MA ) .
Mutagenesis of the B7.1 Enhancer .
- Deletion and linker-scanning mutants of the 183-bp B7.1 enhancer were made by PCR using a panel of synthesized oligonucleotides ( oligos ) .
A 665-bp Pvull fragment was isolated from the 183-bp Stul-Apal enhancer pSyncatll clone and used as the PCR ternplate .
The template contained pSyncatlII sequences and restrection sites Sacll and BamHI flanking the 5 `` and 3 `` end of the enhancer , respectively .
Oligos used to construct the 5 `` and 3 `` deletions of the enhancer also contained Sacll or BamHI sites , respectively .
The 3 ' portions of the enhancer were obtained by PCR with Sacll-containing oligos and an oligo downstream of the enhancer , whereas the 5 `` portions were obtained by PCR with BamHlI-containing oligos and an oligo upstream of the enhancer .
The central portion of the enhancer was obtained by PCR with a pair of the B7.1 oligos flanking the region .
PCR products were digested with Sacll and BamHI and different portions of the enhancer were recovered from agarose gels and recloned into pSyncatIl .
Linker-scanning mutagenesis was performed by a modified over-lap-extension method as described ( 44 ) .
In total , 18 unique oligos were designed to contain a 10-bp mutant sequence flanked by 779 Zhao et al .
15-bp template sequences on either side .
Each oligo was used in PCR to introduce mutations into a specific 10-bp region of the enhancer without changing the enhancer length .
PCR products were digested with SaclI and BamHI , purified from agarose gels , and cloned back into pSyncatll .
DNA sequencing was used to verify all mutant and flanking sequences .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Ab Inhibition .
- Small scale nuclear extracts were prepared from 10 `` Raji B cells as described ( 45 ) .
An electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) was performed as previously described ( 46 ) in a 10-pil final volume containing 8 mM Hepes , pH 7.4 , 0.3 mM MgCl , 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM KCl , 0.8 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM DTT , and 9 % glycerol .
Each binding reaction also included 2.5 ug poly ( dI-dC ) , 2 ug nuclear extract , and ~2 X 10+ cpm of P-labeled probe .
For Ab inhibition , antisera against p50 , p52 , p65 , c-Rel and Rel-B ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) were added at 1 jug per reaction .
Oligo probes and specific or nonspecific competitors used in EMSA included -2983 to -2959 of the hB7.1 enhancer ( 5'-GGGAAAGGGGTTTTCCCAGCAGTCA-3 ' ) , the NF- « B sequence of the Igx enhancer ( 5-CAGAGGGGACTITTC-CGAGA-3 ' ) ( 47 ) , and mutant 3 of the mIL-4 promoter -79 to -60 region ( 5-ATAAAATTTGAACATGTAAA-3 ' `` ) ( 45 ) .
The reaction mixtures were separated on a 5 % nondenaturing poly-acrylamide mini-gel at 80 V for 75 min .
Results and Discussion Isolation and Characterization of a Human B7.1 Genomic Clone .
To isolate a genomic clone encoding the human B7.1 gene , a full-length cDNA was used as a probe to screen a leukocyte genomic DNA library in A EMBL-3 .
From ~6 X 10° plaques screened , 10 clones were isolated that remained positive on tertiary screening .
These clones were then analyzed by Southern blot analysis after restriction enzyme digestion and hybridization with *P-labeled oligonucleotide probes corresponding to sequences derived from different regions of the cDNA .
One clone , AUT -1 , hybridized with probes from the first two exons .
Further analysis of this genomic clone revealed that it contained ~14 kb of DNA upstream of the first exon with the restriction map shown in Fig .
1 .
3.9-kb of DNA flanking the first exon was sequenced on both strands ( Fig .
2 ) .
A search of this sequence using FASTA of the GCG program in the GenBank database revealed the presence of two alu repetitive sequences ( Fig .
1 , I and II ) frequently found in flanking regions and introns ( 48 , 49 ) .
No other significant similarities betweeen the hB7.1 5 !

These sequence data are available from EMBL/Gen- Bank/DDBJ under accession number U33208 .
flanking region and sequences in the database were found , nor was there any significant similarity to the recently published mB7.1 5° UT region .
Further sequencing of a 1.3-kb BamHI-Pacl upstream fragment ( Fig .
1 , IIF ) on one strand revealed a region highly similar to the 3 ' end of a transposon element , line 1 , commonly found in intergenic regions of chromosomes ( data not shown ) ( 50 , 51 ) .
The full length of this transposon is ~6 kb , which could specify two transcripts in the same transcriptional orientation as hB7.1 ( 52 ) .
Two consensus TATAA elements were present at positions -2608 and -2501 relative to the putative transcription start site without neighboring 5 consensus CCAAT motifs .
No TATAA or initiator sequences were present down-stream .
B7.1 Expression Correlates with the Presence of a DNase I Hypersensitive Site in Cultured Cell Lines .
As an initial approach to identify tissue-specific regulatory elements in the hB7.1 gene , the chromatin configuration of this gene was examined in intact nuclei from various cell types by DNase I hypersensitivity assays .
Nuclei from a panel of cultured human lines were isolated and digested with various amounts of DNase I .
The purified DNA was then digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease ( Xhol , BamHI , or SacI ) , electrophoresed , blotted , and hybridized to a 295-bp Scal-BamHI probe spanning the first exon .
The cell lines were 780 Regulation of the B7.1 Gene examined simultaneously by FACS® analysis for surface B7.1 expression using the anti-hB7.1 mAb 133 ( Table 1 ) .
As shown in Fig.3 A , Xhol digestion of nuclear DNA gives the expected single 9.5-kb restriction fragment .
Treatment of nuclear DNA from all cell lines with increasing amounts of DNase I results in the progressive disappearance of the full-length fragment and the appearance of either one or two nuclease-generated subfragments of ~1.7 ( DH site A ) and 4.6 kb ( DH site B . )
.
Since the 1.7-kb subfragment was present in all cell lines tested , we conclude that this new band represents a non-tissue-specific DNase I hypersensitive site .
However , the second 4.6-kb nuclease-generated subfragment appeared only in the cell lines that express surface B7.1 .
Thus , both fragments are present in the EBV5 , SKW , and Raji B7.1-positive B cells , whereas the remaining B7.1-negative cells ( Jurkat T cell , fibroblast and carcinoma cell lines , and pre-B cell lines ) have only the 1.7-kb subfragment .
In only a single case , namely the BL3O B cell , did a B7.1-positive line fail to generate the 4.6-kb DH site B subfragment .
It is possible that unique factors interact with other elements in this transformed cell line to control B7.1 expression .
Indeed , transfection of the BL30 cell line with a construct containing the enhancer region represented by DH site B ( described below ) revealed an absence of activity ( data not shown ) .
Aside from this one cell line , Table 1 .

Presence or absence of DNase I hypersensitive site B in the hB7.1 5¢ flanking region of each cell line was determined by Southern blot analysis and listed as + or - , respectively .
however , DH site B appears to correlate well with the expression of the B7 .
1 gene .
To map the location of the two DH sites more precisely , nuclear DNA from the Raji cell line was digested with additional restriction endonucleases and hybridized to the same probe used in the DNase I hypersensitivity assays .
Digestion with BamHI revealed that sites A and B are ~0.3 and 3.2 kb , respectively , upstream of the BamHI site located 3 ' to exon 1 ( Fig .
3 B ) .
DH site A , therefore , is located very near the putative transcription start site mapped previously by primer extension .
Digestion of DNase I-treated Raji nuclear DNA with Sacl revealed a single 0.6-kb fragment representing site A .
Since site B is not included in the Sacl fragment , it can be mapped between the upstream BamHI and Sacl sites to a location ~100 bp 5 `` to the Sacl site , ~3 kb upstream of the putative start site .
The location of the two DH sites is shown schematically in Fig .
3 C. Localization of a Transcriptional Enhancer at DH Site B .
- 'The 3.3-kb Sacl fragment which includes DH site A did not have transcriptional activity in Raji cells ( Fig .
4 B ) .
It was possible that negative regulatory elements within this region were responsible for the absence of promoter activity .
To test whether DH sites A and B represented B7.1 enhancer elements , we therefore subcloned a variety of fragments encompassing one or both of these sites into pSyncatll , an expression vector containing a minimal herpes virus tk promoter fused to the CAT reporter gene .
Fragments tested in preliminary experiments included a large 5-kb BamHI fragment containing both sites A and B and a smaller 2.8-kb EcoRI fragment containing only site B .
The former had minimal activity whereas the latter gave a threefold increase in CAT activity over the vector alone ( not shown ) .

- 0 -- | A series of restriction endonuclease-generated 5 ' and 3 ' deletion fragments were therefore constructed and tested for transcriptional activity ( Fig .
4 A ) .
The 1.9-kb BamHI-Sacl fragment displayed fivefold activity above background ( Fig .
4 A , lane 2 ) and further deletions of this fragment from the 5° end resulted in increasing levels of reporter gene activity ( lanes 3-5 ) .
A further deletion to the Apal site deleted DH site B and abolished activity ( Fig .
4 A , lane 6 ) , thus establishing the 5 border of the enhancer .
Similarly , deletions from the 3 ' end of the active 486-bp Pacl-Apal fragment ( Fig .
4 A , lane 7 ) to the Stul site 183 bp upstream abolished activity ( lane 8 ) .
These experiments localize the enhancer to a 183-bp Stul-Apal fragment ( Fig .
4 A , lane 9 ) , which is active in both forward and reverse orientations ( lanes 5 , 11 and 4 , 10 ) .
Multiple constructs which included the region surrounding DH site A failed to provide evidence for enhancer function in this location ( data not shown ) .
Because the transcription start site of the hB7.1 gene had been mapped by primer extension to a site 58 nucleotides upstream of the 5 end of the cDNA sequence ( 31 ) , sequences upstream of the first exon were tested for promoter activity .
A 5-kb BamHI fragment and a 3.3-kb Sacl fragment containing the first exon were cloned into the promoterless pSyncatl expression vector .
Deletion variants of the latter construct generated by restriction enzyme di-gestion , ranging from ~0.5 to 2 kb of upstream sequence were also produced .
This series of constructs was tested for promoter activity by transfection into the B7.1-positive Raji B lymphoma cell line .
However , in preliminary ex-periments , no reporter gene activity was detected .
Since 782 Regulation of the B7.1 Gene Figure 4. hB7.1 enhancer activity in transfected Raji cells .
( Solid lines ) The 5° flanking region clone and its deletion variants used for transfection .
Each clone is indicated by the size of restriction fragment listed and only part of the length between the EcoRI site and exon 1 ( black box ) is shown .
The abbreviation of restriction enzymes used are Apal ( 4 ) , BamHI ( B ) , EcoRI ( E ) , EcoNI ( EN ) , Pacl ( P ) , Sacl ( S ) , Spel ( Sp ) , and Stul ( St ) .
Enhancer activity is shown either with a heterologous tk promoter ( 4 ) or with the homologous promoter ( B ) .
Cells were transfected with 20 pug of each plasmid DNA .
One representative CAT assay experiment is shown in A .
The relative CAT activity of lanes 10 and 11 in A and lanes 1-5 in B are calculated based on two separate experiments .
the failure to detect promoter activity might reflect the presence of dominant negative regulatory elements , a construct containing the 486-bp enhancer upstream of a 468-bp EcoNI-BamHI fragment including DH site A in place of the heterologous tk promoter was made .
This construct conferred transcription activity , thus demonstrating that sequences surrounding DH site A can act as a minimal promoter .
Neither the 468-bp promoter fragment nor the 486-bp enhancer alone were active ( Fig .
4 B ) .
The absence of transcriptional activity observed with the longer promoter fragments may be due to the presence of negative regulatory elements downstream of the enhancer , possibly including the alu repeat sequences .
Indeed , removal of the alu sequences increases promoter activity ( Fig .
4 B , compare lanes 5 and 2 ) .
The B7.1 promoter has recently been shown to be transcriptionally active and to contain six elements within the first 150 bp of the promoter that are bound by nuclear proteins ; one of them is NF-KB ( 53 ) .
The B7.1 Enhancer is Cell Type Specific and Inducible by cAMP and LPS .
- B7.1 expression is strictly cell type specific .
To test the tissue specificity of the enhancer region defined above , transient transfections of several constructs which include this region were performed ( Fig .

Cell lines tested included the B7.1-negative Jurkat T lymphoma and Hela epithelial carcinoma and the B7.1-positive human B Lymphoma BA ( 54 ) .
The 585- , 282- , and 183-bp constructs shown to be active in the B7.1-positve Raji B cell line ( Fig .

cells , this 183-bp region is cell type specific .
Additional B7.1-negative cell lines ( Hut78 T cell and G82 glioblas-toma ) also showed no activity ( data not shown ) .
Some modest ( about twofold ) enhancer activity was observed in a B7.1-negative pre-B cell line Nalm 6 with these constructs , but no activity was present when the longer 1.3- , 1.9- , and 3.7-kb constructs were used ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that in B7.1-negative B cells , there may also be a role for negative elements , outside of the 183-bp enhancer , in mediating tissue specificity .
We conclude that the enhancer located at DH site B within the 183-bp Stul-Apal fragment is cell type specific .
Multiple stimuli increase B7.1 expression in B cells and macrophages .
We have previously shown that the M12 cell line expresses low levels of cell surface B7.1 that can be markedly increased by treatment with db-cAMP ( 27 ) .
Treatment of M12 with 30 pg/ml db-cAMP after transfection of the 585- , 282- , and 183-bp constructs results in a modest but reproducible increase in CAT activity ( Fig .
5 B ) .
We were also able to test the induction of transcription activity of the enhancer by LPS in both M12 and in the mouse B7.1-positive myeloblast/monocyte-like cell line M1 .
Treatment of these cell lines with LPS for 48 h results in a modest but reproducible increase in both surface B7.1 expression for M1 ( not tested for M12 ) ( Fig .
5 C , leff ) and CAT activity in both cell lines ( Fig 5 C , right and Fig.5 D ) .
We also tested the native B7.1 promoter fused to the 486-bp enhancer in the M12 cell line .
Induction of transcription by LPS was also observed in this instance ( Fig .
5 D ) .
We conclude that elements within the 183-bp region confer responsiveness to stimuli known to increase B7.1 expression .
Further , enhancer activity is not limited to cells of the B lineage , but can be observed in B7.1-positive , non-B cells , including the HTLV-1-transformed B7.1-positive T cell MT2 ( data not shown ) .
We could not examine other stimuli such as IL-4 or Abs to CD40 , known to induce B7.1 expression in B cells , because of the absence of appropriately inducible , transfectable cell lines .
To establish whether this enhancer region also controls responsiveness to other stimuli such as IL-4 and anti-CD40 may require the production of mice transgenic for the enhancer to allow the examination of B7.1 regulation in normal cells .

GACCAG otides at both the 5 `` ( lanes 5 and 7 ) and 3 ' ( lanes 3 and 7 ) ends of the enhancer were important .
Furthermore , sequences internal to these were also involved in enhancer activity { ( compare lanes 5 with 6 and lanes 3 with 4 ) .
Thus , multiple cis elements appeared to be present within the 183-bp fragment .
To precisely delineate the sequences within the 183-bp region responsible for enhancer function , linker-scanning mutagenesis was performed .
Each linker-scanning mutation was 10 bp in length with the exception of mut 18 784 Regulation of the B7.1 Gene which was 13 bp in length .
Several bases in the 10-bp stretch were mutated to one of the three remaining nucleotides ( see Fig .
6 B ) with each resulting sequence checked to ascertain that no known promoter motif had been inadvertently created .
The wild-type and mutation constructs were transfected into the Raji cell line and the results of three to five independent experiments are shown in Fig .

( D ) Nucleotide sequences of these regions as well as that of region 3. hancer , whereas three additional mutations ( mut 4 , 9 , and 12 ) also reproducibly decreased enhancer activity in five independent experiments .
The locations of these mutations ( Fig .
6 B ) are consistent with the deletion data in Fig .
6 A .
Several additional mutations also modestly decreased activity ( mut 3 , 5 , and 17 ) .
Inspection of the mut 2 , 4 , 9 , 12 , and 16 sequences ( Fig .
6 D ) reveals that site 16 is a consensus NF-KB element that is identical both in its core nucleotides and in the flanking nucleotides to the NF-KB site in the Igxk enhancer .
Mutation of this element resulted in > 70 % abolition of enhancer activity .
The remaining four sequences do not bear homology to known promoter motifs as checked against sequences in the database .
A sequence with a 7/8 nucleotide match to a cAMP response element is also present in the enhancer , but mutation of this element ( mut 3 ) has minimal effect on enhancer activity in Raji cells .
Members of the NF-KB Family Bind to the B7.1 NF-KB Site .
- Using an oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus NF-KB element mutated in site 16 as a probe , EMSAs were performed with nuclear extracts from the B7.1-positive Raji cell line ( Fig .
7 A , leff ) .
A DNA-protein complex could be observed with extracts from Raji ( Fig .
7 A ) , but not with nuclear extracts from Jurkat ( not shown ) that migrates similarly to a complex observed with the Igx NF-KB site ( Fig.7 , righ ? )
.
That this complex was specific was shown by the ability of a 10-100-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type NF-KB oligonucleotides , but not an oligonucleotide from the unrelated IL-4 promoter , to prevent complex formation ( Fig .
7 A ) .
The multimember NF-KB family includes homologous proteins termed p50 , p52 , p65 , c-Rel , and RelB , .
Various combinations of homo- and heterodimers of these family members may activate or repress 785 Zhao et al .
NF- « B-dependent gene transcription ( 55 , 56 ) .
To determine which family members present in Raji cells bound to this site , supershift EMSA experiments were performed using antisera to the p50 , p52 , p65 , c-Rel , and RelB proteins .
Fig .
7 B demonstrates that two complexes can be observed { arrows ) .
The faster migrating lower complex ( Fig .
7 B , 1 ) is supershifted by Abs to p50 , c-Rel , and RelB , suggesting it is a homo- or heterodimer of these proteins whereas the slower migrating upper complex ( Il ) is supershifted by the Abs to p50 and p65 , suggesting it is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 proteins .
Such homo-and heterodimers of various NF-KB family members have been previously observed to bind NF-KB target sequences in many promoters ( 47 , 57 , 58 ) .
The p52 protein is not involved in binding to the B7.1 NF-KB site as judged by the failure of the anti-p52 Ab to affect complex formation .
Cotransfection of M12 B cells with the 183-bp enhancer and NF-KB subunits p50 or p65 expression constructs demonstrated that p65 transactivates the enhancer , whereas p50 does not ( Fig .
7 C ) .
Further , p50 decreases transactivation by p65 , consistent with the known role of p65 as a transcriptional activator and p50 as a repressor .
This is the first description to our knowledge of regulatory elements that control expression of the gene encoding the B7.1 costimulatory molecule .
The presence of a tissue-specific DNase I hypersensitive site ~3 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the human B7.1 gene led to the identification of a cell type-specific enhancer region .
This 183-bp region was both cell type specific and responsive to two distinct stimuli ( LPS and db-cAMP ) known to regulate B7.1 expression .
Site-directed mutagenesis revealed the presence of multiple cis elements within this region , one of which was a NF-KB consensus sequence .

RelB U 2 3 40 50 60 7 8 several members of the NF-KB family in B7.1-positive cells and can be transactivated by the p65 subunit .
The NF-KB family of transcription factors has been shown to be critical for cell development , differentiation , and the response to multiple stimuli .
The five members of this fam-ily-p50 , p52 , p65 , c-Rel , and ReIB-all contain a Rel-homology domain required for binding to DNA .
NF-KB members are present ubiquitously in the cytosol of many different cell types where they form a stable complex with the IKBa and IKBB inhibitor proteins ( 59 , 60 ) .
Activation by mitogenic factors leads to phosphorylation and degradation of IKB and subsequent translocation of NF-KB proteins into the nucleus ( 61-64 ) .
Various homo- and heterodimers of nuclear NF-KB members are potent transactivators or repressors for many developmentally regulated genes .
B7.1 expression is also developmentally regulated and responsive to stimull known to increase nuclear NF-KB activity .
These stimuli include LPS ( 65 ) , cross-linking of CD40 on B cells by soluble CD40 ligand ( 66 , 67 ) , or ligation of B cell 5 H viz I 4~ € 2 € 3 < O o 2 o * o CC 1 -o- _ p50 p6S - p50 + p65 Figure 7 .

surface Ig ( 68 ) .
The induction of NF-KB activity in T cells is regulated by HTLV-1 Tax ( 69 ) .
Mature activated B cells which contain constitutive nuclear NF-KB activity are the major site of expression of B7.1 ( 56 , 70 , 71 ) .
Thymic dendritic cells , the other cell type that constitutively expresses B7.1 , are critically dependent of Rel-B activity since Rel B-deficient mice have recently been shown to lack mature dendritic cells ( 72 ) .
Thus , B7.1 expression appears to parallel NF-KB activity , consistent with a convergence of signal transduction for B7.1-inducing stimuli on this family of transcription factors .
However , our data clearly indicate that other cis elements also control B7.1 expression .
Several additional cis elements with no obvious homology to known promoter motifs were critical for functional enhancer activity .
Now that a B7.1-specific enhancer that functions in concert with a mimimal promoter has been delineated , identification of the factors that bind to these additional elements will be key in further understanding the regulation of this important costimulatory molecule .
