Protein Kinase C and Calcineurin Synergize to Activate IxB Kinase and NF-KB in T Lymphocytes* ( Received for publication , February 25 , 1999 , and in revised form , May 5 , 1999 ) Sergey A. Kevin N. Pennington } , Alicia and Carlos V. Payaf§1 From the { Department of Immunology and the §Division of Infectious Diseases , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , Minnesota 55905 The nuclear factor of « B is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is key in the regulation of the immune response and inflammation .
T cell receptor ( TCR ) cross-linking is in part required for activation of NF-KB , which is dependent on the phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa .
By using Jurkat and primary human T lymphocytes , we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of two second messengers of the TCR-initiated signal transduction , protein kinase C ( PKC ) and calcineurin , results in the synergistic activation of the IxBa kinase ( IKK ) complex but not of another putative IxBa kinase , p90'** .
We also demonstrate that the IKK complex , but not p90'** , is responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of IxBa mediated by the co-activation of PKC and calcineurin .
Each second messenger is nec-essary , as inhibition of either one reverses the activation of the IKK complex and IxBa phosphorylation in vivo .
Overexpression of dominant negative forms of IKKa and -B demonstrates that only IKK is the target for PKC and calcineurin .
These results indicate that within the TCR/CD3 signal transduction pathway both PKC and calcineurin are required for the effective activation of the IKK complex and NF-xB in T lymphocytes .
Identification of the molecular events that ensue in T lymphocytes following antigen presentation is paramount to understanding the regulation of the immune response .
The signal transduction pathways triggered by antigen presentation lead to the immediate activation of transcription factors that further amplify the process of lymphocyte activation , ultimately leading to cell proliferation and division .
Dysregulation of this process results in T lymphocyte anergy , autoimmunity , and disruption of T lymphocyte homeostasis ( 1 , 2 ) .
Two additional settings that would benefit from a better understanding of the molecular events triggered by T cell activation are viral pathogenesis and drug discovery .
For example , HIV integrates in the chromosome of T lymphocytes where it remains latent .

Finally , development of improved immunosuppressive agents that target T cell function will be accelerated by identifying the exact molecular events that result from the molecular events regulating T cell activation .
Effective antigen presentation to T lymphocytes involves not only the engagement of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex but also other receptors that mediate co-activation signals such as CD28 .
How these two separate signal transduction pathways ( TCR/CD3 and CD28 ) converge to result in the maximal activation of the T lymphocyte is under active study .
Engagement of the T cell receptor ( TCR ) by its cognate peptide-major histo-compatibility complex induces phospholipase C activation which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol ( 5 ) .
Diacylglycerol activates protein kinases C ( PKC ) , whereas inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate leads to the release of Ca** from intracellular stores ( 6 , 7 ) .
The same cellular events initiated by phospholipase C activation can be mimicked by treatment with a combination of a Ca** `` ionophore that raises intracellular Ca** levels and phorbol esters that activate PKC isoforms ( 8 ) .
Free intracellular Ca** targets the Ca `` */calmodulin-activated phos-phatase calcineurin which mediates a critical positive signal necessary for IL-2 induction through its synergy with PKC activation , synergy that can be reversed by targeting calcineurin with immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A or FK506 ( 9 , 10 ) .
The initial studies that investigated the targets of the synergy between PKC and calcineurin identified the transcription factors , nuclear factor of activated T cells and nuclear factor of « B ( NF-kB ) ( 9 , 10 , 11 ) , as being activated by the combination of these separate signal transduction pathways .
NF- « B is a heterodimer of transcription factors that belong to the Rel family of proteins .
The canonical NF- « B is a heterodimer of p65 ( RelA ) with p50 or p52 ( 12 , 13 , 14 ) .
This heterodimer is anchored by a group of proteins named IB , which function to retain NF- « B in the cytosol by masking its nuclear localization signal ( 15-18 ) .
IxBa is a prototype IB molecule known to control the subcellular localization of NF- « B ( p50/p65 ) .
Following activation of certain signal transduction pathways , a site-specific hyperphosphorylation of IxBa « at Ser-32 and Ser-36 renders the inhibitor molecule susceptible to site-specific ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome complex ( 19-23 ) .
This releases NF- « B to undergo nuclear translocation .
Two novel IxBa kinases , IKKa ( 24-26 ) and IKKS ( 27 , 28 ) , contained within a high molecular weight complex termed the signalsome target the phosphorylation of Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IxBa and mediate the TNF- @ -induced IxBa hyperphosphorylation and NF- « B activation .
An additional N-terminal IxBa kinase , the mitogen-activated riboso-mal S6 protein kinase RSK-1 or p90'®* ( 29 , 30 ) , has been shown .
to mediate the activation of NF- « B by phorbol esters and to 229283 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 22924 phosphorylate I « Ba preferentially at Ser-32 both in vivo and in vitro .
However , its functional relevance in vivo is yet unclear ( 80 ) .
Previous studies addressing how the PKC- and calcineurin-dependent signal transduction pathways triggered by TCR CD3 cross-linking lead to the synergistic activation of NF- « B identified IxBa as a target molecule ( 11 ) .
Whereas PKC activation by phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) resulted in a moderate degree of IxBa hyperphosphorylation-degradation and activated calcineurin alone had no effect on IxBa , the combined activation of these two second messengers leads to a synergistic and highly effective hyperphosphorylation and degradation of IxBa ( 81 ) .
Moreover , whereas TCR and TNFR triggered separate signal transduction pathways , both ultimately target IxBa , and the use of specific inhibitors of calcineurin and PKC enabled the separation of the signaling pathways of TCR and TNFR ( 31 ) .
Despite this novel observation , the mechanisms whereby two separate second messengers , PKC and calcineurin , lead to the lymphocyte-specific hyperphosphorylation of IxBa remains unknown .
The recent identification of the N-terminal IxBa provides the opportunity to advance in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms , whereas signal transduction pathways triggered by TCR/CD3 cross-linking , separate from those downstream of CD28 , lead to IxBa degradation and NF- « B activation in T lymphocytes .
In this study we have investigated the synergy between two second messengers of the TCR/CD3 pathways , PKC and calcineurin , as regulators of the N-terminal IxBa kinases .
By using primary human T lymphocytes and T lymphocyte cell lines , we demonstrate that PKC- and Ca**-dependent pathways synergistically activate both the IKK complex and p90'** .
In contrast to the activation of the IKK complex , p90 `` ®* activation is calcineurin-independent , and only the IKK complex ( IKK ) but not p90'** mediates I « xBa phosphorylation and NF- « B activation in vivo .
Moreover , the synergistic activation of the IKK signalsome by PKC and calcineurin is inhibited by either calcineurin- or PKC-specific inhibitors suggesting that either signal transduction pathway is required and essential for effectively activating the IKK complex and , hence , NF- « B activation in T lymphocytes .

PKC- and Ca `` +*-dependent pathways are required for the IKK complex activation .
A , the activation of the IKK complex following TCR/CD3 cross-linking is calcineurin-dependent .
Jurkat T cells ( 2 X 10°cells per sample ) were incubated with 3 pg/ml anti-CD3 ( Zanes 2 and 3 ) or isotype control IgG ( Zane 1 ) antibody for 45 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of media .
Cells were then cross-linked on goat anti-mouse-coated plates for 20 min at 387 °C .
Jurkat T cells were pretreated with 20 ng/ml FK506 before incubation with anti-CD3 antibodies ( Zane 3 ) .
IKK activity was measured in an in vitro kinase assay ( IVK ) as described under `` Experimental Procedures , `` using GST-IxBa ( 1-53 amino acids ) as substrate ( IxBa **P ) .
Coomassie staining of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing the IVK ( IxBa ) and immunoblotting ( IB ) for IKKa ( IKKa IB ) were performed .
B , PMA and ionomycin synergize to activate IKK in Jurkat and CD3 * T cells .
Primary CD38 ( Zanes 1-5 ) and Jurkat T cells ( Zanes 6-15 ) were stimulated ( + ) or not ( - ) for 8 min with ionomycin ( JONO ) , PMA , or TNF .
For CD3 T cell activation , PMA was used at 2.5 ng/ml , ionomycin at 0.7 ug/ml for 8 min , and TNF « at 10 ng/ml for 4 min ; for Jurkat T cell stimulation PMA was used at 20 ng/ml , ionomycin at 3.5 ug/ml for 8 min , and TNF-a at 10 ng/ml for 8 min .
IKK activity was measured in an IVK using GST-I « kBa- ( 1-53 ) as substrate ( IxBa *°P ) .
The specificity of IKK kinase activity toward to Ser-82/Ser-86 was demonstrated by using GST-I « Ba ( 1-53 amino acids ) with substituted serines for alanines ( IxB & `` `` `` , lanes 11-15 ) .
In parallel , the level of endogenous IxBa from the same cell extracts were detected by immunoblotting with anti-IxBa antibodies ( IxBa IB in vivo ) .
C , Jurkat T cells were either untreated ( anes 1-5 ) or pretreated with 4 ug/ml neutralizing anti-TNF antibody ( lanes 6-8 ) or with 4 ug/ml isotype control IgG antibody ( Zanes 9-11 ) 1 h prior to stimulation .
Efficiency of the neutralizing anti-TNF antibody was demonstrated by using the mixture of recombinant TNF ( 10 ng/ml ) with neutralizing anti-TNF antibody ( 4 ug/ml ) incubated for 1 h at 4 °C before stimulation ( Zane 5 ) .
IKK activity was measured in IVK as described above .
Equal amounts of the substrate and the immunoprecipitated kinase complex were present in the assay confirmed by Coomassie staining of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing the IVK ( /xBa ) , and immunoblotting ( ZB ) for IKKa ( IKKa IB ) , respectively .
10 % SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie Blue staining .
The purity of both proteins was greater than 90 % .

RESULTS PKC- and Ca* `` *-dependent Pathways Synergize to Activate the IKK Complex in T Cells-Cross-linking of the TCRWCD3 results in the activation of PKC- and Ca**-dependent pathways that synergize in T cells to activate NF- « B by targeting the phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitor , I « xBa ( 11 , 31 ) .
To determine whether TCR cross-linking can lead to IKK activation , we measured the IxBa kinase activity of the IKK complex immunoprecipitated from Jurkat T cells that were activated or not following TCR cross-linking .
Cross-linking of the TCR with anti-CD3 but not IgG antibodies results in a 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 22926 moderate activation of the IKK complex ( Fig .
14 , 2nd lane ) , which is inhibited by pretreatment of Jurkat T cells with the calcineurin-specific inhibitor FK506 ( Fig .
14 , lane 3 ) .
From these results , and based on previous studies from our group ( 11 , 31 ) , we conclude that calcineurin participates in the TCR/ CD3-initiated signal transduction pathway that leads to IKK activation .
To investigate the role of PKC and calcineurin in the activation of the IKK complex , an in vitro kinase assay using IKK complex immunoprecipitates from resting freshly isolated peripheral human T lymphocytes and Jurkat T cells that were or were not stimulated with ionomycin , PMA , or their combination .
Ionomycin stimulation of CD3¢* and Jurkat T cells does not affect the IKK complex activity ( Fig .
1B , lanes 2 and 7 ) , whereas PMA induces a moderate IxBa kinase activity ( Fig .
1B , lanes 3 and 8 ) .
However , stimulation of CD3 * and Jurkat T cells with the combination of PMA and ionomycin increased the IKK complex kinase activity beyond that observed in PMA-treated cells ( Fig .
1B , lanes 4 and 9 ) .
When TNF treatment was used as a control of IKK activation ( 24 ) , it was observed that the degree of TNF activation was similar to that of PMA but significantly lower than that achieved by the combination of PMA and ionomycin ( Fig .
1B , lanes 5 and 10 ) .
The IKK complex kinase activity was specific for Ser-32/Ser-36 , as it was not observed when an IxBa substrate in which both serines were substituted with alanines was used in the in vitro kinase assay ( Fig .
1B , lanes 11-15 ) .
Equal amount of I « Ba substrate present in the in vitro kinase assay ( Fig .
1B , IxkBa ) or the amount of IKK complex immunoprecipitated ( Fig .
1B , lanes I-5 ) confirmed that the increased in vitro phosphorylation of I « Ba is a function of enhanced IKK complex kinase activity .
Similar results were obtained when the IKK complex was immunoprecipitated with additional anti-IKKa or IKK $ antibodies ( data not shown ) .
In addition , Raf-1 immunoprecipitates of cell lysates from PMA , PMA and ionomycin , or TNF -stimulated cells did not result in the phosphorylation of IxBa at Ser-32/Ser-36 , despite evidence of Raf-1 activation following PMA treatment ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether the qualitative differences in the IKK activation triggered by PMA or PMA and ionomycin correlated with the in vivo IxBa hyperphosphorylation , the same cell lysates used for immunoprecipitation of cell kinases were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for endogenous IxBa using anti-IxBa-specific antibodies .
Hyperphosphorylation of IxBa , determined by the slower migrating form of I « Ba , was mainly observed in the PMA- and ionomycin-treated cells ( Fig .
1B , IxBa IB in vivo , lanes 4 and 9 ) .
This observation establishes a direct correlation between the qualitative activation of the IKK complex by PKC- and Ca**-dependent pathways and IxBa hyperphosphorylation in vivo .
To demonstrate that the observed synergistic activation of the IKK complex is the direct effect of PMA and ionomycin co-stimulation , and not due to their secondary induction of TNF , we measured the IxBa kinase activity of the IKK complex from PMA- and ionomycin-treated Jurkat T cells in the presence or not of neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies ( Fig .
1C ) .
Pretreatment of Jurkat T cells with such antibodies abrogates the activation of the IKK complex by recombinant TNF ( Fig .
1C , lanes 4 and 8 ) but has no effect on the IKK complex activation by the combination of PMA and ionomycin ( Fig .
1C , lanes 2 , 3 and 6 , 7 ) .
The specificity of the neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies was confirmed by their preincubation with recombinant TNF ( Fig .
1C , lane 5 ) and by using IgG isotype antibodies as control ( Fig .
1C , lanes 9-11 ) .

Calcineurin mediates synergistic IKK activation , but not p90** , in T cells .
A , Jurkat T cells were pretreated ( + ) or not ( - ) with 20 ng/ml specific calcineurin inhibitor FK506 1 h before stimulation with PMA and/or ionomycin .
Immunoprecipitated p90'** ( p90 `` ** IP ) and the IKK complex ( IKKa IP ) were analyzed in IVK .
IVK and IB are as described in Fig .

B , same as A except that primary CD3¢* T cells were used .
Lymphocytes were pretreated with 100 ng/ml FK506 1 h before stimulation .
ates IxBa at Ser-32 ( 29 , 30 ) , and it is questioned whether it directly results in IxBa phosphorylation and degradation in vivo ( 20-23 , 36 ) .
Because p90'** is a second messenger that is activated by PKC ( 87 ) , we investigated whether Ca**-dependent pathways synergistically activated the presumed IxBa kinase activity of p90'®* that would be induced following PKC stimulation .
Jurkat T cells and freshly isolated peripheral blood CD3 * T lymphocytes were treated with PMA and/or ionomycin , and p90'** and IKK complexes were subsequently immunoprecipitated and analyzed for their ability to phosphorylate IxBa at Ser-32/Ser-36 .
In Jurkat T cells , PMA alone significantly induces the p90'** IxBa activity ( Fig .
24 , IP , lane 2 ) .
However , the combination of PMA and ionomycin only weakly increased the kinase activity of p90'** beyond that induced by the stimulation with PMA alone ( Fig .
24 , p90 `` ** IP , lane 3 ) suggesting that at this concentration of PMA , p90'®* is already fully activated .
In primary CD3 * T cells , and in contrast to that observed in Jurkat T cells , strong synergistic activation of p90 `` toward the IxBa substrate by the combination of PMA and ionomycin was observed ( Fig .
2B , p90'®* IP , lane 4 ) .
Again , stimulation by ionomycin alone does not induce p90 `` ®* activation ( Fig .
2B , p90 ’ Sk IP , lane 2 ) .
Calcineurin Is Required for Synergistic Activation of the IKK Complex but Not p90®* in T Lymphocytes-The role of Ca**-dependent signaling and of calcineurin on the activation of the IKK complex and p90'** kinase activity was investigated in the presence or absence of the calcineurin-specific inhibitor FK506 ( 38 ) .
Jurkat T cells and freshly isolated T lymphocytes were pretreated with FK506 for 1 h followed by their stimulation with PMA , ionomycin , or their combination .

The specificity of FK506 as an inhibitor of the T cell receptor-initiated signaling leading to IKK activation was tested in the TNF-mediated IKK activation and in vivo I « xBa phosphorylation .
TNF-induced IKK activation and IxBa-induced hyperphosphorylation in vivo was not affected by the pretreatment of T lymphocytes with FK506 ( Fig .
2B , in vivo IxBa , lanes 5 and 10 ) .
Altogether , these results demonstrate a direct correlation between the degree of IKK activation and the in vivo IxBa hyperphosphorylation .
Moreover , they point to the necessary role of calcineurin in mediating the hyperphosphorylation of IxBa by IKK following the activation of PKC- and Ca* `` *-dependent signaling that is triggered by TCR cross-linking .
The IKK Complex and Not p90®* Controls Inducible IxBa Phosphorylation and NF- « B Activation in T Cells-To evaluate the in vivo role of p90'** as an IxBa kinase involved in the NF- « B activation following T cell activation , we used the specific MEK-1 inhibitor PD 098059 ( PD ) ( 39 ) to block p90'* activation ( 40 ) .
In Jurkat T cells a strong activation of p90 “ , B IxBa activity by PMA was reversed by PD ( Fig .

The combination of PMA and ionomycin only moderately increased the kinase activity of p90 `` ** ( Fig .

Interestingly , PD did not completely eliminate the PMA- and ionomycin-induced activation of the p90 ** IxBa kinase activity , allowing the detection of a degree of synergy when compared with PMA and PD-treated cells ( Fig .

The specificity of PD as a p90 `` ®* inhibitor in this model was further evaluated by measuring its inhibitory activity on the IKK complex kinase activity from the same lysates .
The synergy between PKC- and Ca**-dependent pathways that results in the activation of the IKK complex as an IxBa kinase ( Fig .
34 , lane 11 ) was minimally modified by PD ( Fig .
3A , lane 14 ) , confirming that PD inhibits p90'** activation but not the IKK complex .
In primary CD3¢ T cells , the IxBa kinase activity of p90'®* toward IxBa substrate was synergistically increased by the combination of PMA and ionomycin ( Fig .
3B , IxBa °°P , lane 4 ) , an effect that was reversed when cells were treated with PD ( Fig .

The increased p90'** kinase activity was independent of the amount of IxBa substrate present in the in vitro kinase assay or the amount of p90'®* immunoprecipitated ( Fig .

As expected , TNF did not increase the IxBa kinase activity of p90 ** ( Fig .

The specificity of PD was once again verified in primary CD3* T cells by determining whether the synergistic activation of the IKK complex activity by PMA and ionomycin was PD-insensitive .

Similarly , TNF-induced IKK activity was PD-insen-sitive ( Fig .
3B , IKK IP , lanes 5 and 10 ) .
The specificity of PD as an inhibitor of the in vitro IxBa kinase activity of p90'®* but not of the IKK complex allowed us to address the relative role of each IxBa kinase in mediating the PMA or PMA- and ionomycin-dependent IxBa hyperphosphorylation and subsequent degradation in primary T cells in vivo .
The same cytosolic extracts from purified CD3¢* T cells that were used for the p90'** and IKK immunoprecipitations experiments were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting with anti-IxBa-specific antibodies .
PMA and ionomycin combined , but not PMA , or ionomycin alone , induced a slower migration form of IxBa that was not reversed in the presence of PD ( Fig .
3B , in vivo IxBa IB , lanes 4 and 9 ) .
To test the in vivo relevance of the regulation of I « xBa phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo by these two kinases , Jurkat T cells were transfected with a « B-dependent reporter gene , and cells were treated or not with PMA alone and combination of PMA and ionomycin in the presence or absence of PD .
As shown in Fig .
3C , the synergistic activation of NF- « B transcriptional activity by combination of PMA and ionomycin was minimally sensitive to PD .
Altogether , while these results indicate that PMA and ionomycin synergize to activate in vitro the IxBa kinase activity of both the IKK complex and of p90'®* , the latter is not regulated by calcineurin and does not appear to play a role in the activation of NF-KB in vivo .

PKCa associates with and phosphorylates IKK ( 41 ) suggesting that the activation of PKCa following TCR/CD3 cross-linking could result in the activation of the IKK complex .
PKC0 , a novel PKC isoform was recently identified as the PKC isoform that synergizes with calcineurin leading to JNK activation ( 42 ) and that is recruited to the TCR at the antigen-presenting cells docking region during antigen presentation ( 43 ) .
To characterize the type of PKC isoform that synergizes with calcineurin to activate the IKK complex , a series of pharmacological inhibitors of PKC were utilized ( 44 ) .
GF109203X ( GF ) inhibits the conventional and novel isoforms , whereas G6 6976 ( G6 ) inhibits only the conventional isoforms ( 45 ) .
The specificity of the PKC inhibitors was verified by using TNF as a PKC-independent stimulus that leads to I « Ba hyperphosphorylation through the activation of the IKK complex ( 46 ) .
Jurkat T cells and freshly isolated CD3 * T cells were pretreated with GF followed by cell stimulation with PMA , ionomycin , or the combination of PMA and ionomycin , followed by the analysis of the IxBa kinase of immunoprecipitated IKK .
GF abrogated the IKK complex kinase activation triggered by PMA or the combination of PMA with ionomycin in both Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
44 , IxBa IVK , lanes 2-4 , 6 , and 7 ) and in primary CD3¢* T lymphocytes ( Fig .
4B , IxBa IVK , lanes 3 , 4 , and 8 , 9 ) .
TNF -induced IKK activation was not reversed by GF pretreatment of Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
44 , IxBa IVK , lanes 4 and 8 ) or of primary CD3* T cells ( Fig .
4B , IxBa IVK , lanes 5 and 10 ) .
As expected from previous results , the loss of IKK complex kinase activity in 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; PKC and Calcineurin Synergize to Activate IKK PMA and ionomycin , but not in TNF-treated cells preincubated with GF directly , correlates with the lack of I « xBa hyperphosphorylation in vivo observed in I « Ba immunoblots of the same cytosolic samples ( Fig .
4 , A and B , in vivo IxBa IB ) .
These observations confirm the requirement for a conventional or novel isoform of PKC for the synergistic IKK activity .
Because GF can inhibit both conventional ( « , B , y ) and novel ( e , 0 , 8 , n , 1 ) PKC isoforms ( 44 ) , we sought to identify which subgroup of the PMA-responsive PKC isoforms was mediating the synergy with calcineurin .
We predicted that if PKCQ would be the PKC isoform that synergized with calcineurin in T cells , pretreatment with GS would not inhibit the PMA and ionomycin-induced activation of the IKK complex kinase activity and , hence , the in vivo I « Ba hyperphosphorylation .
To test this , Jurkat T lymphocytes and freshly isolated primary CD3¢ T cells were preincubated with G6 , followed by their stimulation with PMA , ionomycin , or the combination of PMA and ionomycin and analysis of the IKK complex activity .
G6 selectively inhibited the synergistic activation of the IKK complex kinase activity mediated by the combination of PMA and ionomycin in both Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
44 , IxBa IVK , lanes 2 , 3 and 10 , 11 ) and in primary CD3¢* T cells ( Fig .
4B , IxBa IVK lanes 3 , 4 and 13 , 14 ) .
G6 pretreatment did not affect the TNF-induced IKK complex kinase activation in Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
44 , IxBa IVK , lanes 4 and 12 ) or in primary CD3¢* T cells ( Fig .
4B , IxBa IVK , lanes 5 and 15 ) .
The Gé-dependent inhibition of IKK complex activity triggered by PMA and ionomycin directly correlated with the abrogation of the PMA- and ionomycin-induced IxBa hyperphosphorylation in vivo in both types of T cells ( Fig .
4 , A and B , in vivo IxBa IB ) .
As expected , TNF-mediated IxBa hyperphosphorylation in vivo was not reversed by GO treatment ( Fig .
4 , A and B , in vivo IxBa IB ) .
The functional relevance of these observations was evaluated in Jurkat T cells that were transfected with a xB reporter gene and stimulated or not with PMA or PMA and ionomycin in the presence or not of GF and G6 .
As shown in Fig .
4C , both GF and Go specifically inhibited the PMA and PMA- and ionomycin-induced but not the basal NF- « B-dependent transcriptional activity , suggesting that the conventional PKC isoforms mediate the PMA effects on the activation of IKK .
To confirm the contribution of this subfamily of PKC isoforms to the synergistic activation of NF- « B by calcineurin , wild-type of PKCa was overexpressed alone or in combination with the constitutively active form of calcineurin ACam-AlI ( Fig .
5 ) .
Overexpression of PKCa-wt or ACam-AI alone has no effect on NF- « B .
However , stimulation of PKCa-wt-transfected Jurkat T cell with PMA resulted in NF- « B activation to a degree similar to that induced by PMA and ionomycin co-stimulation in mock-transfected cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
Furthermore , co-expression of PKCa-wt and ACam-Al resulted in a synergistic NF- « B activation ( Fig .
5 ) .
These results indicate that , different from the activation of another cellular kinase , JNK , conventional PKC isoforms such as PKCa can mediate the synergistic interaction with calcineurin following TCR/CD3 cross-linking that results in the activation of the IKK complex kinase activity in T cells .
A Dominant Negative Form of IKKB Blocks NF- « B Activation Triggered by PKC- and Calcineurin-dependent Pathways-By having demonstrated that calcineurin synergizes with PKC to activate the IKK complex , we next investigated the effect of dominant negative forms of IKKa and IKKB on the NF- « B activation that follows PMA-ionomycin cell stimulation .
Jurkat T cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors of dominant negative IKK genes and luciferase reporter genes driven by NF- « B concatamers .

The total DNA amount was normalized up to 2 ug with peDNAS .
Forty hours after transfection , cells were stimulated for 4 h prior to harvest with PMA and ionomycin ( JONO ) .
Luciferase activity was normalized to CAT expression of the pREP4/CAT plasmid .
Overexpression of IKKS kinase dead ( KD ) , but not the wild-type isoforms of IKKa or -B ( data not shown ) , selectively impaired both PMA and PMA/ionomycin-induced up-regulation of NF- « B-driven transcription ( Fig .
6 ) .
Interestingly , overexpression of the IKKa-DN alone did not inhibit the NF- « B activation by PMA and ionomycin , and its combination with the IKKfB-DN did not enhance the inhibition achieved by IKKB-DN alone ( Fig .

These observations extend and confirm the involvement of the IKK complex in the convergence of the PKC and calcineurin signal transduction pathways to mediate IxBa hyperphosphorylation-degradation and NF- « B activation .
DISCUSSION The results presented in this study identify the molecular targets and mechanisms whereby two TCR/CD3-dependent 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 22930 second messengers , PKC and calcineurin , lead to the activation of NF- « B in T lymphocytes .
The identification that cyclosporin A or FK506 are effective inhibitors of IKK activation advances our knowledge as to the function of these commonly used immunosuppressive agents .
Moreover , our results highlight the essential role that conventional PKC isoforms play in the TCR-mediated NF- « B activation , molecules that should be considered as targets for future drug development with the aim of interfering with T cell activation .
NF- « B is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is involved in multiple immune and inflammatory responses ( 47 ) .
T cell cross-linking results in NF-kB activation ( 48-51 ) and together with NF-AT , AP-1 , and octomer leads to IL-2 expression in in vitro experimental settings ( 52-54 ) .
However , NF- « B may play a more significant role in regulating T cell function in vivo than that inferred from studies analyzing the transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 promoter .
The fact that IL-2 production is greatly impaired in c-Rel-deficient lymphocytes ( 55 ) and in T cells with constitutive repression of NF- « B activity ( 56 ) suggests that NF- « B , rather than only the nuclear factor of activated T cells , is required for an adequate T cell function .
Hence , the identification of calcineurin as a necessary component in the activation of IKK by TCR engagement and the complete inhibition of NF-B activation by cyclosporin A and FK506 may explain the effectiveness of such drugs as NF- « B-specific T cell activation inhibitors .
The relevance of NF- « B as a target of TCR engagement is not restricted to understanding the immune response but to other relevant areas such as HIV pathogenesis .
Recent studies indicate that T lymphocytes serve as a reservoir of latent HIV provirus in patients effectively responding to highly active antiretroviral therapy .
The fact that NF- « B is a key transcription factor in reactivating HIV from latency in T lymphocytes explains the HIV reactivation and viral production that ensues following T cell receptor activation of latent HIV-in-fected T cells ( 57 ) .
Identification of calcineurin or of conventional PKC isoform as potential targets of this process could be of future value in the study of HIV reactivation .
In the present study , we find that the IKK complex , and not p90'** , mediates IxBa hyperphosphorylation at Ser-32 and Ser-36 and thus NF- « B activation in vivo following PMA and ionomycin stimulation .
This observation highlights that while both kinases are activated by PKC-dependent pathways and further amplified in a synergistic manner by Ca* `` *-dependent pathways , only the IKK complex appears to be responsible for NF- « B activation via IxBa .
Although IxBa Ser-32 and Ser-36 may prove to be a good in vitro substrate to measure p90'®* activity , its in vivo extrapolation to NF- « B activation may be less certain .
We conclude this from the fact that p90'** and IKK do not co-immunoprecipitate ( data not shown ) and , more im-portantly , that a MEK inhibitor ( PD ) does not affect IKK activation or IxBa phosphorylation in vivo followed by PMA and ionomycin treatment , whereas it completely inhibits p90'®* activation .
The observation that the MEK inhibitor spares the signal transduction pathway leading to NF- « B activation from the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may be of future value in selectively inhibiting and differentiating specific target functions of T cell activation , such as NF- « B versus API mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent activation .
IKKa and -B are contained within a high molecular weight complex with multiple components ( 24 , 27 ) .
The inhibitory effect of dominant negative forms of IKK on NF-KB activation suggests that this kinase is relevant in mediating the synergistic activation of NF-kB by the combination of PKC and calcineurin .
The role of IKKa in this process is less clear .
Although overexpression of dominant negative forms of IKKa PKC and Calcineurin Synergize to Activate IKK had little effect on the PMA and ionomycin-induced NF- « B activity , both endogenous IKKa and IKK become in vivo hy-perphosphorylated following T cell activation ( data not shown ) , thus suggesting that activation of both kinases may be needed for full signalsome activity .
Prior studies ( 27 , 28 ) demonstrated that IKK rather then IKKa played a major role in IxBa phosphorylation by TNF , potentially explaining the stronger effect of overexpressed IKK on induced NF- « B activation observed in these studies ( 25 ) .
The mechanism whereby calcineurin converges with PKC-dependent pathways to activate the IKK complex is unknown .
Previous studies from our group indicated that calcineurin alone had no effect on the activation of NF- « B in T lymphocytes ( 11 ) .
However , its presence was required in order for PKC-dependent pathways to induce a maximal level of NF-KB activation ( 11 , 31 ) .
Results presented here extend and confirm those observations by documenting that the level of IKK activation triggered by PKC-dependent pathways is only moderate and that increased ( Ca®* ) levels alone are not sufficient to activate IKK .
Rather , increased ( Ca** ) levels need to be present at the time of PKC activation to result in maximum IKK activity and hence in vivo IxBa phosphorylation .
The fact that calcineurin alone does not activate IKK does not exclude that it does not target the IKK complex .
Potentially , calcineurin may modify the composition or interaction of proteins with the signalsome .
This could allow for a more effective activation of the signalsome by PKC-dependent pathways .
Alternatively , calcineurin may function upstream of the signalsome by modifying transducers of the PKC-dependent pathway resulting in a more effective downstream activation of IKK by PKC .
Future studies need to address these and other possibilities , which should ultimately lead to the identification of potential targets of new immunosuppressive agents .
The identification of conventional PKC isoforms in the activation of the IKK complex activation is of potential relevance .
By using specific pharmacological inhibitors in primary CD3 * T cells , we conclude that T cell-specific classical PKC isoforms such as « or BI must be involved in this process ( 58-62 ) .
Identification of which of these PKC isoforms that mediate the activation of IKK needs to be pursued .
The recent observation that PKCa can directly interact and activate IKKB but not IKKa ( 41 ) suggests that PKCa can directly mediate TCRCD3-generated signals to the IKK complex .
On the contrary , whereas PKCO is activated during antigen presentation ( 43 ) and involved in the induction of AP-1 transcriptional activity ( 42 , 63 ) , its lack of cytoplasmic membrane translocation following TCR/CD3 activation , together with results presented here , suggests that this T lymphocyte-specific PKC isoform may participate in signal transduction pathways activated following antigen presentation , separate from those initiated from TCR/ CD3 .
Antigen presentation requires not only the activation of TCR/CD3 , but also of other co-stimulatory receptors such as CD28 .
The recent report ( 64 ) demonstrating that the combination of CD3- and CD28-generated signals converge on the mitogen-activated protein 3-type kinase , Cot , suggests that the process of antigen presentation that leads to NF- « B activation may require the separate but coordinated activation of at least TCR/CD3 and CD28 signaling pathways , each one with distinct but necessary second messages .
Future studies should address how two necessary components of the TCR/CD3-initiated pathways , conventional PKC isoforms and calcineurin , interact with the CD28-dependent second messengers to effectively activate NF-kB .
