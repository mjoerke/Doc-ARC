The Molecular and Phenotypic Profile of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma Identifies Distinct Categories of the Disease and Is Consistent With Histogenetic Derivation From Germinal Center-Related B Cells By Luigi Maria Larocca , Daniela Capello , Alessandro Rinelli , Simonetta Nori , Andrea Antinori , Annunziata Gloghini , Antonella Cingolani , Anna Migliazza , Giuseppe Saglio , Sophie Cammilleri-Broet , Martine Raphael , Antonino Carbone , and Gianluca Gaidano Primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected individuals .
The precise histogenetic derivation and the molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL is poorly understood .
In an attempt to clarify the histogenesis and pathogenesis of these lymphomas , 49 PCNSL ( 26 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [ AIDS ] -related and 23 AIDS-unrelated ) were analyzed for multiple biologic markers , which are know n to bear histogenetic and pathogenetic significance for mature B-cell neoplasms .
PCNSL associated frequently ( 50.0 % ) with mutations of BCL-6 5 ' noncoding regions , w hich are regarded as a marker of B-cell transition through the germinal center ( GC ) .
Expression of BCL-6 protein , which is restricted to GC B cells throughout physiologic B-cell maturation , was detected in 100 % AIDS-unrelated PCNSL and in 56.2 % AIDS-related cases .
Notably , among AIDS-related PCNSL , expression of RIMARY CENTRAL NERVOUS system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals infected by the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
The relative risk of PCNSL among HIV-infected hosts approximates 1,000 when compared with the HIV-negative population . ``
'' Although PCNSL has been formally considered rare in HIV~ hosts , recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that the incidence of the disease in apparently immunocompetent individuals has been increasing dramatically during the last two decades . ``
Virtually all acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) -related and the majority of AIDS-unrelated PCNSL derive from B cells , and in all cases present as clinically aggressive tumors .
'** Histologically , the overwhelming majority of PCNSL is represented by diffuse large B-cell lymphomas ( DLCL ) .
Depending on the presence of immunoblastic plasmocytoid features , PCNSL may be further distinguished into large noncleaved cell lymphoma ( LNCCL ) and immunoblastic plasmocytoid lymphoma ( IBPL ) .8* The histogenetic derivation of PCNSL is poorly understood .
Because the central nervous system ( CNS ) lacks lymph nodes and lymphatics , it has been hypothesized that PCNSL may originate from B cells derived from systemic lymphoid tissues and normally trafficking in and out of the CNS .
The molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL is also uncertain , and existing evidence is mainly restricted to the role of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .
Infection by EBV occurs in all AIDS-related PCNSL , whereas it is negative in AIDS-unrelated cases . ``
'' AIDS-related PCNSL frequently express the EB V-encoded latent membrane protein-1 ( LMP-1 ) antigen , which , in turn , upregulates the expression of BCL-2 .
!
5 Because PCNSL are consistently monoclonal , however , it is conceivable that EBV is not sufficient for tumor development .
BCL-6 is a proto-oncogene coding for a zinc finger transcrip-tional repressor which , in the B-cell lineage , is expressed selectively by germinal center ( GC ) B cells . ``
Notably , animal models have demonstrated that expression of BCL-6 is an absolute requirement for physiologic GC formation and Blood , Vol 92 , No 3 ( August 1 ) , 1998 : pp 1011-1019 BCL-6 was mutually exclusive with expression of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -encoded latent membrane protein ( LMP ) -1 and , with few exceptions , also of BCL-2 .
All but one PCNSL expressed hMSH2 , which among mature B cells selectively stains GC B cells .
These data suggest that PCNSL may be frequently related to GC B cells and may be segregated into two major biologic categories based on the expression pattern of BCL-6 , LMP-1 , and BCL-2 .
BCL-6+/LMP-1~/ BCL-2~ PCNSL occur both in the presence and in the absence of HIV infection and consistently display a large noncleaved cell morphology .
Conversely , BCL-6~/LMP-1+/ BCL-2+ PCNSL are restricted to HIV-infected hosts and are represented by lymphomas with immunoblastic features .
These data are relevant for the pathogenesis and histogenesis of PCNSL and may be helpful to segregate distinct biologic and prognostic categories of these lymphomas .

1012 In an attempt to clarify the histogenesis and pathogenesis of PCNSL , we have investigated the genetic status and expression pattern of BCL-6 in AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated PCNSL .
Results were compared with morphology , genetic profile of other cancer-related genes , and expression status of several immunophenotypic markers .
We report that the molecular and phenotypic profile of PECNSL is consistent with an origin from GC B cells in most cases .
Furthermore , the expression pattern of BCL-6 , LMP-1 , and BCL-2 segregates two major biologic categories of PCNSL .
BCL-6+*+/LMP-1~/BCL-2~ PCNSL consistently display a large noncleaved cell morphology and occur both in the presence and in the absence of HIV infection .
Conversely , BCL-6-/LMP-1*/BCL-2+* PCNSL are represented by lymphomas with immunoblastic features and are mainly restricted to HIV-infected hosts .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Tumor samples .
| This study was based on tissue samples of a total of 49 cases of PCNSL , including 26 AIDS-related and 23 AIDS-unrelated cases .
Thirty cases ( 16 AIDS-related and 14 AIDS-unrelated ) were derived from a retrospective series observed at the Institute of Pathology , Catholic University of the Sacred Heart , Rome , Italy .
Nine cases ( six AIDS-related and three AIDS-unrelated ) had been referred to the Neuropathological Laboratory ( Pitié Salpétri¢re , Prof J.J. Hauw ) .
The remaining cases had been referred to multiple different institutions in Europe .
In all instances , the specimen was collected at diagnosis before starting radio and/or chemotherapy .
For morphologic diagnosis , hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa staining was performed after 4 % neutral buffered formalin or Bouin solution fixation and paraffin embedding .
Pathologic specimens were classified according to the Working formulation for NHL and to a revised European-American classification of lymphoid neoplasms ( REAL classification ) . ``
All PCNSL were classified as DLCL according to the REAL classification . ``
'' As previously reported , `` ?
PCNSL cases were further subdivided into two histologic subtypes , ie , LNCCL and IBPL .
In this report , the definition of LNCCL was based on the predominance ( > 80 % ) of cells resembling large noncleaved cells .
The definition of IBPL was based on the predominance ( > 80 % ) of cells resembling large cells , immunoblastic plasmocyt-oid .
PCNSL cases containing a mixture of large noncleaved cells and large cells , immunoblastic plasmocytoid were classified separately as LNCCL/IBPL .
In all cases , the cytologic definition of large noncleaved cell and large cell , immunoblastic plasmocytoid was based on previously reported criteria . ``
'' Immunohistochemistry .
- For immunophenotypic studies , the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex ( ABC-px ) method was performed on paraffin sections using a commercially available kit ( Dako LSAB 2 ; Dakopatts , Glostrup , Denmark ) and the following commercially available monoclonal antibodies ( MoAbs ) : CD3 , CD20 , CD30 , CD4SRA , CD45RO , CD57 , CD68 , CD74 , anti-x and -A immunoglobulin ( Ig ) light chains .
Immunostaining with BCL-2 MoAb ( clone bel2/100/D5 ; Ylem , Avezzano , Italy ) and BCL-6 MoAb ( clone PG-B6 directed against the amino terminal portion of the human BCL-6 product ; obtained from Brunangelo Falini , Institute of Hematology , University of Perugia , Perugia , Italy ) * was performed using the alkaline antialkaline phospha-tase ( APAAP ) methods , as previously described `` and/or the Dako Catalyzed Signal Amplification system ( Dako K 1500 ; Dakopatts ) .
In brief , sections were cut at a thickness of 4 um , mounted on glass slides coated with 3 % aminopropyltrithoxysilane , and allowed to air dry overnight ( ON ) at room temperature ( RT ) .
After dewaxing in xylene and rehydration in a series of ethanols , the sections were immersed in 1 mmol/L EDTA buffer pH 8.0 and pretreated twice for 5 minutes at 750 W in a microwave oven ( MWO ) ( MWO Philips M901 ; Philips , LAROCCA ET AL Eindhoven , The Netherlands ; maximum power 900 W ) .
After cooling down at RT , sections were rinsed in 0.05 mol/L Tris-HCI ] buffer at pH 7.6 and incubated with primary antibodies ON at 4°C .
Biotinylated antimouse Ig were then applied for 15 minutes , followed by streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex .
Sections were washed , incubated with biotinylated tyramide for 15 minutes , washed again , and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase .
After washing , diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) substrate was used as chromogen .
Finally , the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in permount .
In negative controls , the primary antibody was substituted with nonimmune mouse serum .
The LMP-1 antigen was detected on paraffin sections using the APAAP method and a pool of four anti-LMP-1 MoAbs ( CS 1-4 ; Dakopatts ) after enzymatic digestion with pronase ( Biomeda Co , Foster City , CA ) .
The hMSH2 protein was detected by using an anti-hMSH2 MoAb ( clone FE11 ; Oncogene Science , Cambridge , MA ) after MWO pretreat-ment in sodium-cytrate buffer ( 0.01 mol/L sodium cytrate monohydrate at pH 6.0 ) .
An ABC-px method was used with DAB as the chromogen .
In negative controls , the primary antibody was substituted with nonimmune mouse serum .
Nonneoplastic lymphoid samples from lymph node , spleen , tonsil , and appendix were also investigated for the expression of hMSH2 protein .
The percentage of BCL-6+/LMP-1*/BCL-2* , or hMSH2* neoplastic cells was assigned to one of the following categories : 0 , less than 10 % ; 10 % to 25 % ; 25 % to 50 % ; 50 % to 75 % ; and greater than 75 % .
Two-color staining .
Multiple immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect LMP-1 plus BCL-6 protein in selected AIDS-related PCNSL following a previously reported strategy . ``
'' In situ hybridization ( ISH ) .
ISH analysis of EBV-encoded small RNAs ( EBERs ) is a highly sensitive method for detecting latent EBV infection in paraffin-embedded tissue sections , including autopsy mate-rial .
For each case tested , paired paraffin sections were mounted on silanized slides and EBER ISH studies were performed by using a cocktail of fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to the two nuclear EBER ( 1/2 ) RNAs , according to the instructions of the supplier ( Dakopatts ) .
In selected cases , ISH mRNA studies of Ig light chains were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections to assess tumor clonality as previously reported . ``
DNA extraction .
For cryopreserved PCNSL samples , genomic DNA was purified by cell lysis followed by digestion with proteinase K , `` salting out `` extraction , and precipitation by ethanol . ``
'' For PCNSL samples available only as paraffin-embedded blocks , DNA extraction was performed as previously reported .
`` © Oligonucleotides .

This region has been previously shown to harbor > 95 % of BCL-6 mutations occurring in both AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated systemic NHL .
`` * `` * The PCNSL samples investigated displayed a total of 29 PCR-SSCP LAROCCA ET AL variants , which were unique to individual tumor samples ( for representative results , see Fig 1A and B ) .
As described previ-ously , cases of PCNSL were considered positive for mutation when one ore more PCR-SSCP displayed a variant pattern , which could not be ascribed to a population polymorphism .
On this basis , mutations of BCL-6 were scored positive in 24 of 48 ( 50.0 % ) PCNSL , including 11 of 26 ( 42.3 % ) AIDS-related and 13 of 22 ( 59.1 % ) AIDS-unrelated cases ( Table 1 ) .
In selected cases , mutations were further characterized by DNA sequencing analysis ( for representative results , see Fig 1C and D ) .
The characteristics of BCL-6 mutations in PCNSL are summarized in Table 2 .
Gross rearrangements of BCL-6 were investigated in selected cases ( n = 18 ; nine AIDS-related and nine AIDS-unrelated ) for which sufficient cryopreserved tissue was available .
No rearrangement of BCL-6 was observed among the cases tested ( Table 1 ) .
Characterization of other genetic lesions .
Infection by EBV was detected in 26 of 26 ( 100 % ) AIDS-related PCNSL and was negative in all AIDS-unrelated PCNSL ( Table 1 ) .
Among AIDS-related PCNSL , ISH studies demonstrated that EBV infection was harbored by the neoplastic cell population ( not shown ) .
All cases of AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated PCNSL were devoid of rearrangements of BCL-2 and infection by HHV-8 ( Table 1 ) .

On this basis , two major phenotypic profiles could be identified among AIDS-related PCNSL , ie , BCL-6*/LMP-1~/BCL-2~ and BCL-6~/LMP-1*/BCL-2+ .
The phenotypic profile displayed by each individual AIDS-PCNSL was compared with the morphologic features of the tumors , which had been assessed independently without knowledge of the results of phenotypic studies .
Based on the absence or presence of a predominance ( > 80 % ) of tumor cells with immunoblastic features ( see Materials and Methods for details ) , cases were classified as LNCCL or IBPL .
Seven of seven ( 100 % ) cases displaying the BCL-6+*+/LMP-1-/BCL-2~ phenotype were classified as LNCCL ( Table 3 ) .
Conversely , five of seven ( 71.0 % ) cases displaying the BCL-6-/LMP-1*/BCL-2+* phenotype were classified as IBPL ( Table 3 ) .
Two cases of AIDS-related PCNSL ( cases 15 and 16 ; Table 3 ) were found to express BCL-6 , LMP-1 , and BCL-2 .
However , double-staining studies ruled out the coexpression of BCL-6 and LMP-1 by the same neoplastic cell ( Fig 5 ) .
These two AIDS-related PCNSL were composed of an admixture of immunoblasts and tumor cells displaying an LNCCL morphology and were classified separately as LNCCL/IBPL .
When referring to the updated Kiel classification , `` `` these two cases were consistent with the diagnosis of centroblastic polymorphic lymphomas .
Expression of BCL-6 , LMP-1 , and BCL -2 in AIDS-unrelated PCNSL .
Results are summarized in Table 3 .
All AIDS-unrelated PCNSL were devoid of EBV infection and , conse-quently , did not express LMP-1 ( Tables 2 and 3 ) .
Expression of BCL-6 was detected in 14 of 14 ( 100 % ) AIDS-unrelated PCNSL .
Positivity for BCL-6 was nuclear and displayed a microgranular pattern ( not shown ) .
Expression of BCL-2 was restricted to 2 of 14 cases ( 14.3 % ) .
All AIDS-unrelated PCNSL were histologically classified as LNCCL .
Comparison between BCL-6 protein expression and mutation of BCL-6 5 ' noncoding regions in PCNSL .
- Similiar to systemic lymphomas of HIV-infected individuals , `` expression of BCL -6 protein was found to occur both in the presence and in the absence of mutations of BCL-6 5 ' noncoding regions .
When considering cases investigated for both mutations and protein expression of BCL-6 , mutations of BCL-6 5 ' noncoding regions occurred in 10 of 22 ( 45.4 % ) PCNSL expressing the BCL-6 protein , including 4 of 9 ( 44.4 % ) AIDS-related PCNSL and 6 of 13 ( 46.2 % ) AIDS-unrelated PCNSL .
However , because the immunohistochemistry technique used for BCL-6 protein detec- LAROCCA ET AL tion does not allow quantitation of the cellular levels of the protein , we were unable to assess variations , if any , of the BCL-6 expression levels in PCNSL harboring BCL-6 mutations as compared with cases devoid of mutations .
Expression of hMSH2 in AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated PCNSL .
- hMSH2 is a DNA mismatch repair enzyme located in the nucleus and involved in the control of fidelity of genomic replication . ``
'' Expression of hMSH2 has been studied extensively in epithelial tissues and cancers , whereas its expression pattern in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissues is un-known.4'** Evidence obtained by one of us ( L.M.L , unpublished observation ) had suggested that hMSH2 expression among mature B-cell subsets clusters with GC cells , thus prompting our analysis of this protein among PCNSL .
Immunoreactivity for the anti-hMSH2 MoAb was scored using the criteria described above ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Figure 6 shows that hMSH2 is a nuclear located protein that in normal mature lymphoid tissues is selectively expressed by follicular GC B cells ; the mantle , paracortical , and marginal zones score negative for hMSH2 expression with the exception of isolated large cells ( Fig 6A through D ) .
Among PCNSL , hMSH2 protein was expressed by 29 of 30 ( 96.7 % ) tested cases , including 16 of 16 ( 100 % ) AIDS-related and 13 of 14 ( 92.8 % ) AIDS-unrelated cases .
The staining pattern was nuclear and of moderate intensity ( Fig 6E ) .
DISCUSSION The aim of this study was to characterize the histogenesis and pathogenesis of the clinicopathologic spectrum of PCNSL , including AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated cases .
The results indicate that PCNSL frequently associate with molecular and phenotypic features consistent with GC B-cell phenotype , suggesting that a large fraction of PCNSL may be histogenetically related to GC B cell .
Differential expression of BCL-6 , BCL-2 , and LMP-1 segregates distinct phenotypic patterns , which preferentially associate with specific morphologic variants of the disease .
These findings may bear implications for the classification and diagnosis of PCNSL .
Our molecular analysis indicates that mutations of the 5 ' noncoding regions of BCL-6 represent the most frequent proto-oncogene lesion presently detectable among PCNSL .
The relevance of this finding is threefold .
First , mutations of BCL-6 5 ' noncoding regions are regarded as a genetic marker specifically acquired by B cells at the time of transition through the GC , whereas they are rare or absent in B-cell subsets that have not transited through the On this basis , the frequent occurrence of BCL-6 mutations among PCNSL suggests that a substantial fraction of these tumors may derive from B cells related to the GC and localized subsequently to the CNS .
Second , the frequency of BCL-6 mutations and their location in the proximity of the BCL-6 promoter suggest that these mutations may have been selected during tumorigenesis based on their potential ability to deregulate BCL-6 expression , as also indicated by data obtained from in vitro models .
* Third , the frequency and tumor specificity of BCL-6 mutations among PCNSL suggest that these lesions may prove to be a valuable marker for the molecular monitoring of the disease .
It is curious that , despite the frequent rate of BCL-6 mutations , PCNSL appear to be devoid of BCL-6 rearrangements , From HISTOGENETIC AND PATHOGENETIC FEATURES OF PCNSL by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

which occur in approximately 30 % to 40 % of systemic DLCL of the immunocompetent host and in 15 % to 20 % of AIDS-related DLCL .
`` `` > 4° The reason for the absence of BCL-6 rearrangements among AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated PCNSL remains unexplained .
It is possible that the combination of BCL-6 mutations and EBV infection may be sufficient for PCNSL development in the context of AIDS , whereas an additional , presently unknown , genetic alteration may substitute for EBV in AIDS-unrelated PCNSL .
The notion that PCNSL are histogenetically related to GC B cells is further corroborated by our observation that PCNSL frequently express the BCL-6 protein .
In fact , BCL-6 expression clusters with GC B cells throughout physiologic B-cell differentiation . ``
Whereas all AIDS-unrelated PCNSL score positive for BCL-6 expression , AIDS-related PCNSL display a certain degree of heterogeneity .
Notably , expression of BCL-6 is absent in AIDS-related PCNSL expressing the EBV-encoded LMP-1 antigen .

1018 and LMP-1 observed among AIDS-related PCNSL is reminiscent of that detected among systemic AIDS-related NHL and is consistent with data derived from in vitro models suggesting that LMP-1 is able to downregulate BCL-6 . ``
Consistent with the fact that LMP-1 upregulates BCL-2 , BCL-6-/LMP-1+ PCNSL generally express BCL-2 .
!
° Conversely , the majority of BCL-6+/LMP-1~ PCNSL are BCL-2~ .
The expression pattern of BCL-6 , LMP-1 , and BCL-2 might bear practical implications for the differential diagnosis of PCNSL morphologic subtypes , which are known to display a certain degree of overlap when classified on pure histologic grounds .
In fact , different expression patterns of BCL-6 , LMP-1 , and BCL-2 preferentially associate with distinct histologic variants of the disease .
In particular , BCL-6+/LMP-1~/ BCL-2~ PCNSL tend to display a large noncleaved cell morphology , whereas BCL-6~/LMP-1*/BCL-2+* PCNSL are mainly represented by lymphomas with immunoblastic features .
On this basis , it is conceivable that expression of BCL-6 , LMP-1 , and BCL-2 may contribute a valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of PCNSL histologic variants .
Ongoing studies are aimed at clarifying the clinical relevance of the PCNSL phenotypic heterogeneity in terms of the host 's immune status , response to treatment , and outcome .
