Kalden , and Hanns-Martin Lorenz The objective of this study was to test whether CD45 signals can influence signaling processes in activated human lymphoblasts .
To this end , we generated lymphoblasts which proliferate in response to common y-chain cytokines , but readily undergo apoptosis after cytokine withdrawal .
In experiments with the CD4SRO mAb UCHL-1 , but not control CD45 mAbs , we found significant inhibition of proliferation .
Interestingly , the pan-CD45 mAb GAP8.3 , which is most effective in inhibition of OKT-3-mediated proliferation in quiescent lymphocytes , was ineffective in lymphoblasts .
Addition of CD3 mAb OKT-3 had no influence on IL-2-mediated proliferation ( with or without UCHL-1 ) .
In contrast , after addition of OKT-3 to IL-4- and IL-7-stimulated proliferation assays , UCHL-1 signals could not significantly alter cellular proliferation .
We did not find induction of apoptosis following CD45R0 signaling .
In Western blots using mAbs detecting phosphorylated STAT-3 , STAT-5 , STAT-6 , or extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 , we found that CD4SRO signaling could effectively diminish phosphorylation of these intracellular signaling components .
Using RT-PCR , we found that CD4S5RO signaling inhibited IL-2 mRNA production without major influence on IL-13 , IL-5 , or IFN-y mRNA levels .
Costimulation with OKT-3 and IL-2 optimally induced secretion of IFN-y , TNF-a , and IL-5 , which was not decreased by CD45 signals .
In conclusion , we illustrate that CD4SRO signals control early cytokine receptor-associated signaling processes and mRNA and DNA synthesis in activated human lymphoblasts .
Furthermore , we show the existence of CD45 epitopes ( GAP38.3 ) , which are active and critical for signaling in quiescent lymphocytes , but are nonfunctional in activated human lymphoblasts .

We and other investigators reported CD45 mAbs to be inhibitory to T and B lymphocyte proliferation ( 1-6 ) as well as basophil degranulation ( 7 ) .
On the other hand , CD45 expression also seems to be an absolute prerequisite for T and B lymphocyte activation ( 8-14 ) .
Perhaps the major contender for transduction of intracellular signals following CD45 cross-linking is the phosphotyrosine phosphatase enzyme activity located in the intracellular domain of €D45 ( 15-18 ) .
This 705 aa domain apparently causes constitutive dephosphorylation of its substrate p56 `` at Tyr `` , leading to its subsequent activation ( 19 , 20 ) .
Moreover , in CD4S5-negative cell lines decreased p59 `` activity was described ( 21 ) .
Retransfection of CD45 into these cells leads to p56 `` activation .

( 25 , 26 ) have shown that dimerization of CD45 ( after binding of epidermal growth factor in epidermal growth factor receptor-CD45 chimera ( 25 , 26 ) , binding of mAb ) switches phosphatase activity off , leading to autophosphorylation of the negative regulatory Tyr® `` and subsequent deactivation of p56 `` .
However , this notion has recently been challenged by the finding that in thymocytes of CD45 knockout mice p56 `` * is hyperphosphorylated at its positive regulatory Tyr® `` * , with its activity being elevated 2- to 4-fold ( 27 , 28 ) .
Some investigators have also reported costimulatory rather than inhibitory properties of different €D45 mAbs upon T cell ( 29 , 30 ) and B cell activation ( 31 ) , again highlighting epitope specificity of CD45 signaling processes .
CD45 seems to play an important role in coupling the TCR to the phosphatidyl inositol pathway ( 14 ) .
Cross-linking of CD45 with certain mAbs diminishes both inositol phosphate formation and Ca `` * flux upon stimulation with CD3/TCR or CD2 ( 8 , 22 , 23 , 32-34 ) , again suggesting a major role for CD45 in regulating early intracellular signaling processes in lymphocytes .
Recently , an association of €D45 to lipid microdomains as major platforms regulating signal transduction has been discussed ( 35 ) .
In this model , CD45 cells release activated p56 `` into the microdomain ( dephosphorylated on Tyr®~ `` ) , enabling signal transduction through the TCR-CD3-CD4 complex ( 35 , 36 ) .
A prerequisite for this model is that CD45 is excluded from , but still is very close to , * Abbreviations used in this paper : PKC , protein kinase C ; y.. , common y-chain ; ERK , extracellular signal-related kinase ; PI , propidium iodide ; Jak , Janus kinase .

This represents a new mechanistic model which might help explaining the partially contradictory findings in CD45 signaling .
In contrast to results associating decreased PKC activity and T cell inactivation with CD45-transduced signaling , our previous findings suggest an additional role for CD4S5-triggered signaling , namely , cellular adhesion .
We observed that triggering of PBMCs with certain mAbs to CD45 , CD45RA , or CD45RO leads to LFA-1/ICAM-1-dependent , heterotypic cellular aggregation ( 3 ) .
The CD45 -associated phenomena occur independent of PKC activation and appear to be linked to subsequent activation of cAMP/cGMP-dependent kinases ( 3 , 37 ) .
We could demonstrate ( 38 ) that triggering CD45 through certain epitopes induces intracellular cAMP accumulation and activation of protein kinase A in a dose- and time-dependent fashion .
This cAMP synthesis did not occur in purified resting T cells and required presence of viable monocytes .
Blockade of T cell-monocyte interactions with ICAM-1 mAb could prevent cAMP synthesis ( 38 ) .
In this paper , we investigated the role of CD45 signaling in activated human lymphoblasts .
We herein describe that signals through CD45RO can inhibit proliferation and mRNA synthesis after stimulation with common y-chain ( 7 , ) cytokines .
Studying intracellular signaling events we found that cosignaling through CD45RO specifically inhibits IL-2-triggered phosphorylation of STAT-3 , STAT-5 , and extracellular signal-related kinase ( ERK ) 1/2 , and IL-4-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT-3 and STAT-6 .
These data associate y , cytokine receptor signaling events with CD45 -regulated intracellular signaling processes in lymphoblasts and again highlight the dominant role for CD45 in influencing early cellular activation steps in human lymphocytes .

6035 Quantification of apoptosis Microscopic examination of the cell cultures prone to undergo apoptosis revealed morphological changes like zeiosis .
For quantification of apoptosis , DNA staining with propidium iodide ( PI ; Sigma ) and flow cytometry analysis were performed as previously described ( 39 ) .
In brief , 4 X 10° cells were pelleted with 200 X g and gently resuspended in 150 ul of hypotonic fluorochrome solution of 50 ug/ml PI in 0.1 % ( w/v ) sodium citrate plus 0.1 % ( v/v ) Triton X-100 ( Sigma ) .
After a minimum period of 6 h in the dark at 4°C , samples were analyzed on a FACScan ( Coulter , Hialeah , FL ) .
The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as follows : percentage of cells with subdiploid DNA content X 100 divided by percentage of all cells positive for PI staining .
Cell proliferation assays [ ?
HJThymidine uptake and incorporation into genomic DNA was used to quantify cellular proliferation .
PHA blasts ( 1 X 10° ) were incubated for 72 h in a total volume of 150 ul of medium in a 96-well round-bottom microtiter plate ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) with the indicated reagents in triplicates at 37°C and 5 % CO , .
Samples were pulsed for the last 6 h with 0.5 uCi/well [ H ] thymidine ( 2 Ci/mmol ; Amersham , Braunschweig , Germany ) and harvested onto glass fiber filters .
Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting .
Western blot analysis IL-2-expanded PHA blasts were extensively washed and aliquots of 1 % 10° cells were cultured for 8 h in medium .
Thereafter , UCHL-1 mAb was added for 10 min before IL-2 , IL-4 , or OKT-3 were pipetted to culture medium as indicated .
After another 10-20 min , cells were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris ( pH 7.6 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 0.5 % ( v/v ) Nonidet P-40 , 1 % ( v/v ) Triton X-100 , 1 mM sodium vanadate , 1 mM PMSF , 10 pg/ml aprotinin , 10 ug/ml pepstatin , 10 ug/ml leupeptin , and 0.25 % sodium deoxycholate at 4°C for 1 h ( all reagents from Sigma ) Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 X g at 4°C .
Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford method protein assay kit ( Bio-Rad , Munich , Germany ) .
Twenty micrograms of total protein lysates from each sample was diluted in an equal volume of 2X SDS sample buffer , boiled for 5 min , and resolved by SDS-PAGE .
Immunoblots were performed by semidry transfer from the proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes .
Unspecific binding sites were blocked in freshly prepared 5 % nonfat dry milk in PBS/0.1 % Tween 20 for at least 30 min at room temperature .
A total of 0.1-1 pg/ml of the specific Ab as indicated was incubated in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C .
Subsequently , 0.2-1 pg/ml HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse ( or anti-rabbit ) IgG was added in blocking buffer for 1.5 h at room temperature .
Detection was performed using ECL ( Amersham ) .
After detection of phosphorylated forms of proteins , Abs were washed off the membranes by incubation in 62.5 mM NaCl , 100 mM 2-ME , and 2 % SDS for 30 min at 50-60°C .
After washing in PBS/0.1 % Tween 20 , membranes were blocked as described above , and staining with Abs specific for all forms of signaling molecules was performed as described .
mRNA semiquantification by RT-PCR To analyze the expression of apoptosis-related gene products , lymphoblasts were lysed 6-8 h ( some variation in between the experiments ) after stimulation with the reagents as indicated , and total RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) following the manufacturer 's protocol .
mRNA purification included DNase digestion on the column following the manufacturer 's recommendations .
mRNA was reverse transcribed with oligo ( dT ) primers and amplified with gene-specific primers as described elsewhere ( 40 ) .
The gene-specific primers ( all intron spanning ) and PCR conditions were as follows : GAPDH upstream , 5'-GCAGGGGGGAGCCAAAAGGG-3 ' ; downstream , 5 `` -CCATGGACGGTCGGGGTCGCAGTTTC-3 ' ( 60°C for 1 min , 72°C for 1 min ) ; IL-2 upstream , 5-ATGTACAGGATGCAACTCCTG TCTT-3 ' ; downstream , 5'-GTTAGTGTTGAGATGATGCTTTGAC-3 ' ( 60°C for 1 min , 72°C for 1 min ) ; IL-4 upstream , 5'-ATGGGTCTCACC TCCCAACTGCT-3 ' ; downstream , TCTCAT-3 ' ( 60°C for 3 min ) ; IL-5 upstream , GAGTTTGCTAGCT-3 ' ; downstream , 5-TGGCCGTCAATGTATTITTCIT TATTAAG-3 ' ( 60°C for 3 min ) ; IL-12 ( 40-kDa ) upstream , 5 `` -TAATCG TCCAAAAGTGTTA-3 ' ; - downstream , _ 5 `` -TTCTGTTCTGCTGTGTCT TG-3 ' ( 60°C for 3 min ) , IL-13 upstream , 5'-ATCACCCAGAACCAGA AG-3 ' ; downstream , 5-GAACCGTCCCTCGCGAAAAAGT-3 ' ( 60°C for 1min , 72°C for 1 min ) ; TNF-a « upstream , 5 -ATGAGCACTGAAAGCATGA TCCGG-3 ' ; downstream , 5-GCAATGATCCCAAAGTAGACCTGCCC-3 ' ( 60°C for 1 min , 72°C for 1 min ) ; IFN-y upstream , 5'-ATGAAATATA 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6036 CAAGTTATATCTTGGCTIT-3 ' ; | downstream , - 5'-GATGCTCTITCGAC CTCGAAACAGCAT-3 ' ( 60°C for 3 min ) ; TNFR p60 upstream , 5'- TGT GTCTCCTGTAGTAACTG-3 ' ; downstream , 5'-ACGAATTCCTITTCCAG CGCAA-3 `` ( 60°C for 1min ) , 72°C for 1 min ) ; TNFR p80 upstream , 5'-AAGTCCCTGACTCTGTGTGA-3 ' ; and downstream , 5 `` -TCCTGAGTCAA CTTGAAGGA-3 ' ( 60°C for 1 min , 72°C for 1 min ) .
cDNA was amplified for 28 and 35 cycles ( 21 and 28 cycles for GAPDH ) .
After agarose gel electrophoresis , PCR products were visualized under UV light , and band intensities of the corresponding cycles were graded as described elsewhere ( 40 ) .
Measurement of cytokines in culture supernatants Cytokines in culture supernatants were measured using ELISA kits from R & D Systems ( for IL-5 , IFN-y , and TNF-a ; Wiesbaden , Germany ) .
For measurement of IL-2 , we used capture anti-IL-2 Ab MAB602 and biotin-linked detection Ab BAF202 ( both from R & D Systems ) along with streptavidin-peroxidase and peroxidase substrate ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
Quantification of IL-4 was performed with capture anti-IL-4 Ab 8D4-8 and biotin-linked detection Ab MP4-25D2 ( both from PharMingen , Hamburg , Germany ) along with streptavidin-peroxidase and peroxidase substrate ( Boehringer Mannheim ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
Statistical analysis was performed using a paired or unpaired ( where appropriate ) nonparametric Wilcoxon test .
Results In freshly isolated PBMCs , pan-CD45 mAbs NIH4S5-2 and GAP8.3 as well as CD45RO mAb UCHL-1 , but not CD45RA mAb HB11 , strongly inhibited cellular proliferation in response to various stimuli like CD3 mAb OKT-3 ( Fig .
1 ) , superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B , or CD2 mAbs ( data not shown ) .
These data show that all of these mAbs with the exception of HB11 bind to CD45 epitopes with signaling capacities .
To study the influence of CD45 signals on activated human lymphocytes , we generated lymphoblasts as described in Materials and Methods .
These cells will readily proliferate specifically after activation with y , , cytokines IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , or IL-15 ( Fig .
2 ) .
In contrast , cytokine withdrawal induces programmed cell death ( 41 ) .

mAbs NIH4S-2 , GAP8.3 , or CD45RO mAb UCHL-1 alone did not lead to proliferation .
Importantly , however , UCHL-1 , in contrast to GAP8.3 or NIH4S-2 ( data not shown ) , significantly inhibited proliferation triggered by IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , or IL-15 ( Fig .
2 ) .
Furthermore , stimulation of lymphoblasts with CD3 mAb OKT-3 alone did not trigger proliferation ( Fig .
2 ) .
Interestingly , however , cosignaling through CD3 and CD4SRO diminished UCHL-1-mediated inhibition of IL-4- or IL-7-triggered proliferation ( Fig .
2 ) , whereas IL-2- and IL-15-dependent DNA synthesis was practically unaffected by OKT-3 ( Fig .
2 ) .
This pattern held through for all concentrations of cytokines tested ( 1-10 U/ml or ng/ml , respec-tively , data not shown ) .
Since lymphoblasts are prone to undergo apoptosis upon various stimuli , especially those limiting proliferation , we wondered whether this UCHL-1-mediated inhibition of proliferation consequently induced apoptosis , or vice versa was the effect of increased apoptosis as seen after cytokine withdrawal .
To this end , we compared percentages of apoptosis under various concentrations of IL-2 or IL-4 .
Table I shows that suboptimal concentrations of IL-2 not only lead to decreased DNA synthesis ( Fig .
2 ) , but subsequently also to increased rates of apoptosis .
Importantly , however , addition of UCHL-1 or GAP8.3 did not induce apoptosis over the quantities seen in cytokine-stimulated lymphoblasts in the absence of Abs ( Table I ) .
Similar results were seen when we tested various concentrations of IL-4 in the identical experimental setting ( data not shown ) .
For optimal signal transduction after y , cytokine stimulation , tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of several proteins like STAT-3 , STAT-5 , ERK1/2 , or STAT-6 ( IL-4 STAT ) is required ( reviewed in Refs .
42 and 43 ) .
These early signaling proteins are regulated in their activity via tyrosine phosphorylation 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology 6037 Table I .

( 43 , 44 ) .
Thus , based on the results as demonstrated , it was tempting to hypothesize that CD45 phosphotyrosine phosphatase interferes with these phosphorylation processes , thereby limiting cellular activation through cytokine signals .
To test this , we performed Western blots , staining with Abs recognizing the ty-rosine-phosphorylated forms of STAT-3 , STAT-5 , STAT-6 , or ERK1/2 .
As control for equal protein loading , we used Abs detecting all forms of the respective protein after stripping of the identical membranes .
As shown in Fig .
3 , compared with cells kept in medium ( Zanes 1-3 ) , IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 , STAT-5 , and ERK 1/2 ( lane 4 ) , whereas IL-4 led to phosphorylation of STAT-3 and STAT-6 ( Zane 7 ) .
Notably , however , addition of the CD45RO mAb UCHL-1 or the pan-CD45 mAb GAP8.3 ( Fig .
3 , lanes 2 and 3 ) was ineffective alone .
UCHL-1 strongly diminished IL-2-mediated phosphorylation of STAT-3 , STAT-5 , and ERK1/2 ( Fig .
3 , lane 5 ) , and IL-4 induced phosphorylation of STAT-3 and STAT-6 after IL-4 stimulation ( Fig .
3 , lane 8 ) .
Control mAb GAPS8.3 did not significantly influence STAT or ERK phosphorylation under these conditions ( Fig .
3 , lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 ) .
Importantly , after stripping of the membranes as described in Materials and Methods , staining with STAT or ERK Abs recognizing all forms of these intracellular signaling molecules revealed equal protein loading in each lane ( with some lower protein content in the STAT-3 blot in lane 9 ) .

After 8 h of cytokine deprivation , UCHL-1 or GAP8.3 ( Gap ) mAb was added as specified .
After 10 min , IL-2 or IL-4 was pipetted to culture medium , and cells were lysed after another 10-20 min .
Western blots for phosphorylated STATs or ERK1/2 were performed as described in Materials and Methods .
Thereafter , membranes were stripped , washed , and exposed to mAbs recognizing all forms of STATs or ERK1/2 .
The experiment shown is representative of three different experiments with similar results .
Next , we investigated whether CD4SRO signals not only influenced DNA synthesis and early intracellular cytokine signaling , but could also change mRNA production after IL-2 or IL-4 stim-ulation .
Fig .
4 denotes that stimulation of lymphoblasts with IL-2 ( lane 4 ) specifically led to increased IL-13 mRNA synthesis , with no effects on IL-2 , TNF-a , IFN-y , or IL-5 mRNA .
IL-4 was not effective in inducing mRNA synthesis over the background level .
Interestingly , under costimulation with IL-2 or IL-4 , UCHL-1 ( Fig .
4 , lanes 5 and 8 ) , but not GAPS.3 signaling ( Fig .
4 , lanes 6 and 9 ) alone could consistently diminish IL-2 mRNA quantities at least 4-fold ( semiquantified as described by Lagoo-Deenadayalan et al .
( 40 ) ) .
This was also seen in many , but not all lymphoblasts only stimulated with UCHL-1 ( Fig .
4 , lane 2 ) .
Moreover , coactivation through UCHL-1 and IL-2 and , to a lesser extent , GAP8.3 and IL-2 , but not Ab combinations along with IL-4 , increased TNF-a mRNA levels ( Fig .
5 , lanes 3-6 and 7-9 ) .
Furthermore , we investigated the influence of the various stimuli on mRNA expression of IL-4 , TNF- « receptors p60 and p80 , and IL-12 .
IL-4 and TNF-a receptor p80 mRNA levels were unaffected , whereas we could not detect IL-12 or TNF-a receptor p60 mRNA in lymphoblasts ( data not shown ) .

Sixteen to 20 h after stimulation under the various conditions as specified , supernatants were collected and concentrations of IFN-y were determined as described in Materials and Methods .
Data are mean values + SD from three different experiments .
Similarly , we wondered , whether these changes in mRNA production were also reflected in alterations of protein secretion .
To this end , we collected supernatants after overnight stimulation of lymphoblasts under identical experimental conditions .
We did not detect IL-2 or IL-4 in any supernatants ( except for those where the cytokines had been added exogenously , data not shown ) .
Measurements of IFN-y , TNF-a @ , and IL-5 concentrations indicated that IL-2 , but not IL-4 , was able to stimulate secretion of the cytokines in low quantities over the background level , which was not altered by signals through CD45 epitopes recognized by UCHL-1 or GAP8.3 ( Figs .
5-7 ) .
In contrast , after activation through CD3 , lymphoblasts secreted TNF-a and IFN-y , but not IL-5 , in quantities comparable to the IL-2 effects ( Figs .
5-7 ) .
Secretion of these cytokines was again not significantly influenced by CD45 cosig-naling .
Costimulation with OKT-3 and IL-2 , but not OKT-3 and IL-4 , consistently and synergistically induced secretion of high levels of TNF-a ( Fig .
6 ) and especially IL-5 and IFN-y ( Figs .
5 and 7 ) , which was again not diminished by €D45 signaling .
Discussion In this paper , we investigated the role of CD45 signaling in activated human lymphoblasts .
As described , lymphoblasts are not comparable to quiescent lymphocytes in their intracellular signaling responses to the identical stimuli .
For example , Fas/Apo-1 stimulation will lead to apoptotic cell death in activated cells , whereas quiescent lymphocytes are unresponsive to these triggers ( 45 ) .
CD3 stimulation in quiescent cells leads to cellular prolifer-ation ; in activated cells , however , these triggers can lead to apoptotic cell death under certain circumstances ( 46 ) .
Since we have been studying intracellular €D45 signaling in quiescent PBMCs in the past ( 3 , 37 , 38 ) , we were interested in the effects of these stimuli in activated lymphoblasts .
We herein describe that signals through CD45RO can inhibit proliferation , mRNA synthesis , and y , , receptor-associated signals in human peripheral nonlineage lymphoblasts .

Data are mean values + SD from three different experiments .
portantly , signals through the epitopes recognized by pan-CD45 mAb GAP8.3 have different effects in lymphocytes vs lymphoblasts : in quiescent cells this mAb is most effective in inhibiting OKT proliferation ( Fig .
1 ) , whereas it served as a negative control mAb in our experiments with lymphoblasts , not influencing y , - and OKT-3-induced signals .

One could speculate that CD45 association to signaling rafts differs in lymphocytes vs lymphoblasts , and that the various CD45 epitopes differentially regulate intracellular signaling complexes present in the adjacent signaling rafts .
These findings again highlight the unique role of CD45 among cellular surface molecules .
CD45RO mAb UCHL-1 showed similar efficacy in limiting y , cytokine-mediated lymphoblast proliferation independent of the cytokine used .
Vice versa , cosignaling through OKT-3 was more effective in preventing UCHL-1-mediated inhibition of IL-4- or IL-7-stimulated cell growth .
In experiments studying intracellular signaling events , we found that signaling through CD45RO specifically inhibited IL-2-triggered phosphorylation of STAT-3 , STAT-5 , and ERK-1/2 as well as IL-4-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT-3 and STAT-6 .
STAT proteins are activated through members of the Janus kinase ( Jak ) family ( Jak1 , Jak2 , Jak3 , Tyk2 ) which play a crucial role in many cellular functions ( 47 , 48 ) .
Based on our findings , one could speculate that CD45 signals regulate STAT phosphorylation through differential activation of Jak1 or Jak3 in human lymphoblasts .
Indeed , Irie-Sasaki et al .
( 49 ) have recently shown that in CD45-negative cell lines ( lymphocytic , monocytic , mast cells ) and mice the cell-associated members of the Jak family as well as STAT-1 , STAT-3 , or STAT-5 are hy-perphosphorylated .
Moreover , the authors provide evidence for a direct association of Jak2 with the intracellular phosphatase domains of CD45 in vitro , leading to dephosphorylation ( 49 ) .
These findings clearly support our hypothesis of a regulation of STAT phosphorylation by CD45 signals ( as shown in this paper ) through a direct deactivation of Jak1 and/or Jak3 in human lymphoblasts .
PHA-stimulated and IL-2-expanded lymphoblasts readily undergo apoptosis when cultured in the absence of : y , cytokines ( 41 ) .
Moreover , signaling through €D95 , steroid receptors , or addition of chemotherapeutic agents like daunorubicine or etoposide leads to programmed cell death in a large proportion of these cells ( 50 ) .
Thus , we hypothesized that inhibition of proliferation in these highly activated cells must consequently lead to apoptosis .
However , as shown in Results , despite considerable inhibition of proliferation we did not see induction of programmed cell death over the background level in these apoptosis-prone lymphoblasts in response to CD45 signals .
We could recently confirm these results in experiments in which we almost completely suppressed cytokine-mediated proliferation in lymphoblasts by addition of agents inhibiting various intracellular signaling kinases .
Under those conditions we did not find a relevant increase of apoptotic cell death ( Ref .
51 ; C. Gabler , T. Hieronymus , N. Blank , M. Schiller , J. H. Berden , S. Winkler , J. R. Kalden , and H.-M. Lorenz , manuscript in preparation ) .
These data support the notion that regulation of proliferation and apoptosis are not necessarily interrelated .
As shown in this paper , human lymphoblasts display a dual role which is differentially regulated .
On the one hand , there is proliferation and survival which is dependent on exocrine stimulation with y. , cytokines ( we found no autocrine production of IL-2 and IL-4 by lymphoblasts ) .
This response is mediated through Jak/ STAT signaling events and is controlled by €D45 stimuli as demonstrated in this paper .
On the other hand , there is production of cytokines which clearly do not contribute to proliferation and survival ( Ref .
41 and C. Gabler , T. Hieronymus , N. Blank , M. Schiller , J. H. Berden , S. Winkler , J. R. Kalden , and H.-M. Lorenz , unpublished observation ) and might stimulate neighboring APCs or lymphocytes/lymphoblasts ( TNF- « @ , IFN-y , IL-5 ) .
However , synthesis of these cytokines is supported by signals through the y , , cytokine receptors and TCR-CD3 complex , but , in contrast to the proliferative response , can not be inhibited by CD45 signals ( Figs .
6039 6-8 ) , which suggests that secretion of these cytokines occurs independent of STAT/ERK signaling molecules .
Our data collectively associate y. cytokine signaling events with CD45 -regulated intracellular signaling processes in nonlineage human lymphoblasts and again highlight the dominant role for €D45 in influencing early cellular activation steps in human lymphocytes and lymphoblasts .
Recently , CD45 was discussed as membranous gatekeeper determining early intracellular signaling events by influencing phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of associated proteins organized in lipid microdomains ( 35 ) .
Extraction of plasma membrane proteins with certain nonionic detergents at cold temperatures results in segregation of constituents into soluble and insoluble fractions .
The insoluble fraction is enriched in choles-terol , glycosphingolipids , membrane proteins linked to glycophos-phatidylinositol , and certain signaling proteins including src family kinases , CD3/TCR , CD4 or CD8 , and linker for activation of T cells ( 35 , 52-54 ) .
It was concluded that signaling molecules differentially and specifically translocate into membrane microdomains after activation .
The role of €D45 in controlling signaling processes through these microdomains is still disputed .
It has previously been noted that the extracellular domain of CD45 is much larger in size when compared with the Ag receptor and low molecular mass signaling molecules ( 35 ) .
On the other hand , CD45 has been shown to be recruited to the contact area of a T cell with an APC ( 55 , 56 ) .
Thus , it was hypothesized ( 35 , 36 ) that CD45 is excluded from membrane microdomains , but must be in close proximity to the signaling rafts .
In this context , it will be of great interest to investigate formation of microdomains in lympho-kine-stimulated lymphoblasts and to study the differential role of CD45-phosphatase in influencing signaling processes in these lymphoblasts .
