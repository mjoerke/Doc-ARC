HEMATOPOIESIS c-Maf Induces Monocytic Differentiation and Apoptosis in Bipotent Myeloid Progenitors By Shrikanth P. Hegde , JingFeng Zhao , Richard A. Ashmun , and Linda H. Shapiro The transcriptional mechanisms that drive colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage ( CFU-GM ) myeloid progenitors to differentiate into cells of either the granulocytic or monocytic lineage are not fully understood .
We have show n that the c-Maf and c-Myb transcription factors physically interact in myeloid cells to form inhibitory complexes that hinder transactivation of c-Myb target genes through direct binding to Myb consensus sites .
These complexes arise in a developmentally regulated pattern , peaking at the promyelo-cyte stage , or in cell model systems , appearing soon after the induction of monocytic differentiation .
We wished to determine if this developmentally related interaction is a consequence of myeloid differentiation or an intrinsic differentiating stimulus .
Because the elevated Myb : Maf status seen in RECISE REGULATION OF the c-Myb transcription factor is essential for normal hematopoiesis .
Interference with T-cell-specific c-Myb expression in transgenic mice causes growth arrest and reduced proliferative capacity of the T-cell compartment .
c-Myb null mice die late in gestation and display greatly reduced numbers of hematopoietic progenitors , presumably due to their reduced capacity to establish a normal proliferative program . ``
However , these progenitors can still differentiate , suggesting that c-Myb sustains hematopoietic progenitor cells in a proliferative mode , thereby regulating the shift between proliferation and differentiation .
`` ~ Consequently , inhibition of Myb activity during hematopoiesis could block proliferation , setting the stage for differentiation on receipt of the appropriate inductive signals .
Members of the Maf family of basic region/leucine zipper ( bZIP ) transcription factors play an essential role in growth and development by regulating tissue-specific gene expression . ``
'' These proteins activate or repress transcription depending on their particular protein partner and the context of the target promoter .
For example , selective expression of c-Maf dictates the ratio of T-helper cell subsets by positively regulating interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) expression . ``

Elevated levels of c-Maf protein led to marked increases in Myb : Maf complexes and the accumulation of monocyte/ macrophage cells , followed by eventual programmed cell death .
Analysis of targets that could mediate these phenotypic changes indicated that c-Maf likely plays a key role in myeloid cell development through dual mechanisms ; inhibition of a select set of c-Myb regulated targets , such as Bc/-2 and CD13/APN , coupled with the activation of as yet undefined differentiation-promoting genes .

binds to and inhibits the activity of the Ets-1 protein in avian myeloid cells . ``
Maf family proteins are essential to both avian and mammalian development and differentiation .
The tissue restricted avian L-Maf regulates multiple lens-specific genes , and ectopic expression of this protein is sufficient to induce lens differentiation in ectodermal and cultured cells . ``
Finally , c-Maf null mice have severe multisystem defects with high mortality rates in late gestation ( L. Glimcher , personal communication , July 1998 , and Kim et als ) , illustrating a fundamental role for c-Maf in mammalian development .
We have recently demonstrated ?
that c-Myb and c-Maf physically interact , resulting in the inhibition of Myb-dependent gene transcription in early myeloid cells through a mechanism that requires the binding of c-Myb , but not Maf , to DNA .
Although c-Maf mRNA and protein levels remain constant during myeloid development , the formation of inhibitory Myb : Maf-DNA complexes is developmentally regulated , with the highest levels found in promyelocytic cells and in progenitors soon after their induction to differentiate .
By contrast , markedly lower levels of these complexes are present in either immature myeloblasts or later developmental stages , and during terminal differentiation .
The regulation of complex formation appears to be independent of Myb , as addition of Myb protein does not affect Myb : Maf complex levels , or do levels of free Myb protein correlate with complex levels . ``
This developmental pattern of protein interaction suggests that Maf modulation of c-Myb activity may be an important regulatory pathway for the control of transcription and the initiation of myeloid cell differentiation .
Enforced expression of c-Maf in early myeloid cells lacking Myb : Maf complexes results in the formation of inhibitory complexes , thereby recapitulating the regulatory interactions normally occurring in maturing myeloid cells . ``
Because downregulation of Myb may prepare cells for differentiation , we postulated that conditional expression of c-Maf would both inhibit obligatory Myb targets and provide the necessary inductive signals to drive cells to differentiate .
Here we report that induction of c-Maf in 2 bipotential human myeloid cell lines induces the appearance and accumulation of cells characteristic of the monocytic phenotype .

c-Maf INDUCES MONOCYTIC DIFFERENTIATION Myb : Maf complexes in these induced clones increased in a pattern similar to that seen on phorbol-induced monocytic differentiation , supporting the hypothesis that c-Maf plays a crucial role in myeloid cell differentiation .
Finally , prolonged c-Maf induction in these cell lines results in a decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels and subsequent apoptotic cell death , consistent with inhibition of Myb activity and terminal monocytic differentiation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines .
- Human cell lines included the myeloid leukemia lines HL-60 ( American Type Culture Collection [ ATCC ] , Rockville , MD , CRL 1593 ) and U937 ( ATCC , CRL 1593 ) .
Cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 10 % fetal calf serum .
HL-60 and U937 cells were induced to differentiate by using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol diester ( TPA , 5 X 1075 mol/L ) added to the culture medium ; cells were harvested at indicated time points after addition .
Anti-IL-4 and matched control antibodies ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) were used according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Expression vectors and reporter plasmids .

c-Maf INDUCES MONOCYTIC DIFFERENTIATION based expression vector pMT-CB6 . ``
Although protein expression from the individual clones varied , extremely high induction of c-Maf was detected in several clonal lines ( Fig 1B ) .
The low level of endogenous c-Maf protein in parental cells is not detectable in whole-cell lysates , but is evident on immunopre-cipitation followed by Western blot analysis . ``
Consistent with our model , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) analysis of myeloid cell lysates indicated a dose-dependent increase in the levels of Myb : Maf containing complexes binding to the CDI3/APN target promoter fragment on zinc induction of c-Maf-containing clonal lines ( Figs 1C , lanes 4 and 5 ; 1D , lanes 10 to 16 ) , in effect , mirroring the increase observed in cell lysates from TPA-induced ( monocytic lineage ) parental cell lines ( Fig 1D , lanes 17 and 18 ) .
These complexes consist of physically interacting Myb and Maf proteins bound to the Myb consensus site in the target promoter fragment as confirmed by competitor oligonucleotide and specific antibody abrogation of the complexes ( Fig 1C , lanes 6 to 8 and Hegde et al `` ) .
Maf itself does not contact the CDI3/APN promoter probe . ``
Therefore , these c-Maf-expressing clones recapitulate the Myb : Maf status of myeloid cells driven to differentiate along the monocyte/ macrophage pathway .
Our initial observations of three different pMT-c-Maf-containing U937 clonal cell lines showed striking morphological changes after 48 hours of zinc induction .
These cells proliferated more slowly , were noticeably larger , extensively vacuolated and multinucleated with a decreased nuclear : cytoplasmic ratio ( Fig 2 , lower left panel ) , characteristic of macrophage morphology .
To verify this phenotypic designation , cells were stained for « -napthyl-butyrate esterase ( ANB , Fig 2 , right panel ) , a standard indicator of monocytic specification . ``
The development of deep red cytoplasmic staining in 50 % to 60 % of the c-Maf-overexpressing cells and TPA-treated control cells verified the presence of ANB esterase and confirmed that c-Maf overexpression triggered monocytic differentiation .
To confirm these observations in other myeloid progenitors , we also examined c-Maf-expressing clones established in HL-60 cells that readily differentiate into monocytes when treated with TPA . ``
c-Maf-overexpressing HL-60 cells also displayed characteristics of differentiation along the monocytic lineage , including ANB esterase positive cells with a decreased nuclear : cytoplasmic ratio ( Fig 3A ) .
These changes occurred more rapidly in the HL-60 cells than in the U937 lines : early morphologic changes and esterase activity were apparent after 12 hours of zinc treatment ( data not shown ) , which correlated closely with c-Maf protein levels ( Fig 3B ) .
By 24 to 48 hours after zinc induction , 70 % to 90 % of the cells exhibited morphology characteristic of differentiated monocytic cells , comparable to that seen on TPA treatment ( 89 % to 95 % ) .
A smaller proportion of multinucleated cells was apparent in c-Maf containing HL-60 as compared with U937 cell cultures ( 4 % v 15 % containing 2 to 15 nuclei ) , and this ratio increased slightly on longer zinc incubation ( 10 % at 48 to 72 hours ) .
ANB esterase staining of cytospin preparations indicated that 45 % to 50 % of c-Maf-expressing cells displayed this monocyte-specific enzyme activity , identical to ratios obtained in parental cells or HL-60 c-Maf clone 6 cells induced with TPA ( ~50 % ) .
Similar morphologic and ANB data were obtained with HL-60 c-Maf clone 4 , while identical treatment of vector containing 1581 control cells showed no analogous changes ( data not shown ) .
Finally , the induction of c-Maf in these clones altered their normal growth kinetics , as illustrated by the reduced proliferative capacity of c-Maf containing clones , but not vector control clones after exposure to zinc ( Fig 3C ) .
The induction of monocytic differentiation by c-Maf was further confirmed in individual HL-60 clones cultured in zinc ( protein levels shown in Fig 1B ) by flow cytometry and Northern blot analysis ( Fig 4 ) .
Elevated cell-surface levels of the myeloid maturation marker CD11b to levels equivalent to those seen on TPA induction and the monocyte-restricted CD14 protein to levels higher than TPA induced cells ( Fig 4A ) , and the appearance of low , but significant , levels of CSF-1 receptor mRNA ( Fig 4B ) confirms the monocytic phenotype of the c-Maf-containing cells .
Thus , the enforced expression of c-Maf in multiple independent clones in two different cell lines induces phenotypic changes consistent with monocytic differentiation .
IL-4 does not play a role in inducing monocytic differentiation .
_ What are the possible mechanisms of monocytic differentiation induced by c-Maf ?
Relatively few hematopoietic target genes have been identified that are directly regulated by c-Maf through its activity as a DNA-binding transcription factor .
Recent data have indicated that c-Maf directly activates the expression of IL-4 in T-helper cells and can induce the expression of the endogenous IL-4 gene in IL-4-negative B-cell lines . ``
In several models of experimental inflammation , exog-enous IL-4 can initiate the formation of multinucleated giant cells ( MGC ) through macrophage fusion . '
'' `` `` MGC contain multiple nuclei within extensively spread cytoplasm , `` similar to the phenotype of a percentage of c-Maf-induced monocytes , raising the possibility that overexpression of c-Maf in myeloid cell lines could also induce ectopic IL-4 production .
To address this issue , we performed RT-PCR analysis ( Fig 5A ) .
Although c-Maf mRNA is highly induced in our myeloid clones ( lanes 8 and 9 ) , its upregulation does not initiate IL-4 mRNA synthesis ( Janes 3 and 4 ) .
In addition , we added neutralizing antibodies to IL-4 to cultures of zinc-induced c-Maf clonal cell lines ; these antibodies had no discernable effect on the previously observed morphologic changes or ANB esterase positivity ( Fig 5B ) .
Similarly , addition of inhibitory concentrations of cyclosporin A ( a potent and specific inhibitor of the calcineurin-dependent transcription factors required for IL-4 transcription `` ) had no effect on the c-Maf-induced phenotypic changes ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that in our system , c-Maf induction does not initiate endogenous IL-4 expression and , therefore , IL-4 does not contribute to the observed monocytic differentiation .
Inhibition of Myb activity is not sufficient to drive differentiation .
- During myeloid differentiation , c-Maf forms inhibitory complexes with c-Myb , which function independently of Maf 's binding to DNA . ``
Because the c-Maf protein controls gene expression through DNA-dependent , as well as DNA-indepen-dent , mechanisms , Maf-induced differentiation could be triggered by either or both of these mechanisms.5 `` 2 `` To confirm that c-Maf induction altered Myb transactivation in our stable HL-60 clones , we transiently transfected these cells with Myb-dependent CDI3S/APN promoter-driven reporter con-structs . ``

Flow cytometric analysis of the DNA content of propidium iodide stained cells showed the appearance of a significant percentage of c-Maf , and a higher ratio of positive control MEnT expressing lines , present in a sub-G ; peak by 24 hours and as shown at 72 hours ( Fig 8A ) , indicative of apoptotic cell death .
Untreated cells ( Fig 8A ) or vector control cells treated with zinc ( data not shown ) did not result in similar DNA content profiles .
We confirmed that c-Maf containing cells were dying by apoptosis by TUNEL assay ( Fig 8B ) and DNA fragmentation analysis ( Fig 8C ) .
This latter assay also indicated that c-Maf-induced apoptosis is delayed relative to that induced by the positive control MEnT fusion protein ( 24 to 48 hours v 6 hours ) , probably reflecting differences in the range of Myb targets inhibited by Maf versus MEnT .
Because it was possible that apoptosis was triggered by Maf downregulation of Bel-2 through inhibition of Myb activity , we determined Bel-2 protein levels in the induced cells by Western blot analysis ( Fig 9 ) .
As expected , conditional expression of the MEnT Myb interfering protein in 2 HL-60 clonal cell lines resulted in decreased Bel-2 expression ( Fig 9A ) .
Induction of c-Maf in HL-60 cells also reduced Bcl-2 protein levels between 12 and 24 hours of induction ( Fig 9B ) , directly corresponding with the upregulation of Maf protein and the formation of inhibitory Myb : Maf complexes ( Fig 1C ) .
By contrast , addition of zinc to vector containing control cell lines showed no change in Bcel-2 levels ( Fig 9B ) .
Overall , these data suggest that Maf inhibits Myb transregulatory activity , which in turn , downregu-lates Bel-2 , resulting in apoptotic cell death .
DISCUSSION Here we show that elevated , conditional expression of c-Maf in bipotent myeloid cell lines is sufficient to promote differentiation to monocytes .
Elevation of c-Maf causes an increase in the levels of Myb : Maf complexes , recapitulating the increase seen when these lines are induced to monocytic differentiation .
Enforced expression of the c-Maf protein correlated precisely with the induction of morphological changes , the appearance of cell-surface markers , and the induction of cytosolic enzyme activities characteristic of monocytic differentiation .
Maf 's induction of differentiation was independent of the expression of IL-4 , a direct transcriptional target of c-Maf , but was associated with the inhibition of c-Myb activity , including the Myb targets CDI3/APN and Bel-2 .
This inhibition of Bel-2 correlated with the induction of apoptosis following the differentiation of c-Maf-expressing cells and was consistent with Bel-2 downregulation seen during normal terminal myeloid differentiation .
`` `` > `` However , inhibition of c-Myb alone does not appear to account for all of the effects of c-Maf , as conditional expression of dominant interfering Myb proteins in HL-60 cells did not induce c-Maf-like differentiation .
Hence , c-Maf likely plays a key role in myeloid cell development through dual mechanisms ; inhibition of selected c-Myb regulated targets coupled with the activation of as yet undefined differentiation-promoting genes .

An additional striking morphological change observed on induction of c-Maf expression is the appearance of large , multinucleated , intensely ANB esterase positive cells .
These cells strongly resemble MGC , which are characterized by randomly arranged nuclei within extensively spread cyto-plasm . ``
MGC are a primary histologic feature of chronic inflammatory processes such as tubercular granulomas'* `` and result from macrophage fusion rather than endomitosis .
MGC are formed through a 2-step process ; progenitor cells must first mature to macrophages before membrane fusion can occur . ``
Therefore , the presence of cells that resemble MGC in c-Maf-induced clonal lines is consistent with our assertion that c-Maf drives cells toward monocytic differentiation .

HL-60 c-Maf # 6 HL-60 CB6 # 3 Surprisingly , although c-Maf can initiate IL-4 expression in IL-4 negative B cells , `` and IL-4 promotes MGC formation , `` `` 22 attempts to implicate IL-4 in the formation of the large cells in our cultures have been unsuccessful .
Endogenous IL-4 mRNA was not upregulated in c-Maf expressing myeloid cells and blocking of IL-4 activity with neutralizing antibodies had no effect on c-Maf-induced phenotypic alterations or differentiation ( Fig 5 ) .
It is thus possible that other effectors shown to promote MGC formation , such as IL-13 or interferon-y ( IFN-y ) , `` are responsible for formation of MGC-like cells in our clones .
Downregulation of Myb expression is strictly required for the progression of hematopoietic cell differentiation , `` but the question of whether Myb plays a role in inducing cells to differentiate is still unresolved .
In our system , inhibition of Myb alone by the MEnT construct does not induce monocytic differentiation .
Although the arrest of Myb-driven transcription by the MEnT dominant interfering protein results in alterations in cell morphology , we see no evidence of differentiation as determined by production of alpha-napthyl-butyrate esterase or induction of monocytic cell-surface markers over a wide range of time points .
By contrast , these indicators of monocytic - “ 1587 « V K « C s - Mmm - NMAEVT Rha ze -5c-2 1 - 2 1 2 clone # 12 24 48 72 96 induction time ( hrs ) ..q- - c-Maf - Bcol-2 waay yams wars Wake o -- - Actin differentiation are readily detectable in parallel cultures of c-Maf inducible lines .
Therefore , our observations support a hypothesis enjoining a broader role for c-Maf in inducing monocytic differentiation , as inhibiting Myb activity alone does not appear to recapitulate c-Maf-induced differentiation when assayed at early ( 6 to 18 hours ) or later ( 72 hours ) time points . ``
'' Furthermore , the fact that c-Maf-expressing cells do not immediately undergo programmed cell death , even though Myb is inhibited , reinforces this observation and may suggest that other antiapoptotic proteins either continue to function or are activated by Maf expression , thereby delaying apoptosis until after differentiation .
Conversely , because the MEnT construct used in this study inhibits transcription from any promoter containing Myb binding sites and because Maf does not inhibit all Myb-regulated genes , `` the MEnT encoded protein undoubtedly inhibits a larger array of genes than does Myb : alone .
It is possible that physiologic Myb downregulation does induce differentiation , but the global repression of Myb transcription by MEnT forces cells to undergo an accelerated apoptosis , bypassing or surpassing the normal differentiation phase induced by the less abrupt physiologic Myb downregulation .

1588 lines expressing functionally defined mutant Maf constructs will help to clarify this question .
In the hematopoietic system , terminal differentiation of myeloid cells is tightly associated with programmed cell death .
`` `` `` * Levels of Bel-2 mRNA and its encoded protein coordinately decrease during normal myelomonocytic maturation and terminal monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells , `` `` providing a mechanistic link between normal differentiation and programmed cell death .
The gene encoding the antiapoptotic protein Bcel-2 is a direct transcriptional target of Myb , and inhibition of Myb activity leads to apoptosis in hematopoietic cells .
`` `` > ° In agree-ment , we observed apoptotic cell death in c-Maf expressing HL-60 clones that paralleled c-Maf expression , Myb : Maf inhibitory complex formation , cell differentiation , and a decline in Bcel-2 protein levels .
Whether this Bel-2 decrease is the result of Maf 's inhibition of Myb transcriptional activity or is a consequence of the physiologic Bel-2 decline seen during myeloid cell differentiation remains to be determined .
If Myb mRNA levels normally decline during development , would it be necessary to invoke a second developmental strategy to inhibit Myb-regulated genes ?
It is possible that to prepare cells for differentiation , it is necessary to selectively refine Myb 's positive effects on a subset of responder genes before its physiologic downregulation .
Myb : Maf complex levels do not strictly correlate with Myb mRNA and protein levels in myeloid cell lines : despite low levels of Myb : Maf in complex , U937 cells contain Myb mRNA levels equivalent to those in HL-60 cells , where concentrations of Myb : Maf in complex with DNA are significantly higher ( Fig 1A , and Hegde et al `` ) .
This suggests that Myb levels alone do not dictate Myb : Maf complex formation , so that high Myb levels could transactivate some target genes even as Myb : Maf complexes are blocking the expression of others .
Interestingly , in promoter assays using fibroblasts that do not express c-Myb and thus lack Myb : Maf complexes , c-Myb positively autoregulates its own transcription through binding to Myb consensus sites located in its 5'-flanking region . ``
'' However , Myb transcription is negatively regulated through these same Myb sites when assays are performed in Myb-expressing T cells .
While we have not studied Myb : complex formation in T cells , it is intriguing to speculate that the negative regulation observed in these cells results from endogenous Myb : Maf inhibition of Myb transcription as an initial step in the differentiation-linked decline of Myb mRNA .
Studies to address these questions during myeloid cell development are important to our further understanding of Maf 's role in myelopoiesis .
