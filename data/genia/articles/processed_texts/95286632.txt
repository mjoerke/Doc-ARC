The Transcription Factor , Nm23H2 , Binds to and Activates the Translocated ec-mye Allele in Burkitt 's Lymphoma* ( Received for publication , March 17 , 1995 ) Lin Ji , Magdalena Arcinas , and Linda M. Boxer ?
From the Center for Molecular Biology in Medicine , VAMC , Palo Alto , California 94304 and the Department of Medicine , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California 94305 We have identified an in vivo footprint over the PuF site on the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
The PuF site on the silent normal e-mye allele was unoccupied .
We demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , electrophoretic mobility shift assay with antibody , UV cross-linking followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis , and Western analysis that Nm23H2 in B cell nuclear extracts bound to the e-mye PuF site .
Transfection experiments with c-mye promoter constructs in both DHL-9 and Raji cells revealed that the PuF site functioned as a positive regulatory element in B cells with a drop in activity with mutation of this site , Access to this site is blocked in the normal silent c-myc allele ; these data suggest that the Nm23H2 protein is involved in deregulation of the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
In Burkitt 's lymphoma cells , one c-myc allele is juxtaposed to either the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus or to one of the light chain loci .
The translocated c-myc gene is expressed at high levels , while the normal c-myc allele is silent ( 1-4 ) .
In all of the cases with an intact e-mye transcription unit , there are structural alterations at the first exon/intron boundary ( 5-8 ) , and c-myc transcription initiates preferentially at promoter P1 in contrast to normal cells in which the P2 promoter is the major transcriptional start site ( 9 , 10 ) .
In addition , the block to RNA elongation is not present in the translocated c-myc allele ( 11-13 ) .
The deregulated c-mye gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of Burkitt 's lymphoma .
Transgenic mice that carried the c-myc gene linked to the immunoglobulin intron enhancer developed B cell malignancies ( 14 , 15 ) .
Furthermore , when lymphoblastoid cells immortalized by Epstein-Barr virus were transfected with a constitutively expressed c-myc gene , the cells became tumorigenic in nude mice ( 16 ) .
Although the mechanism of the deregulation of the translocated c-myc gene is unknown , regulatory elements of the immunoglobulin locus may play a role ( 17 , 18 ) .
We are studying the interplay between the c-myc and immunoglobulin regulatory elements , and we have previously described two NF-kB sites in the c-myc gene that are occupied only on the translocated c-myc allele ( 19 ) .
In this report , we characterize the role of the Nm23H2 transcription factor in the regulation of the * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants CA34233 and CA56764 and by a grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs .

translocated c-myc gene .
The nm23 gene products are involved in the control of tumor metastasis by mechanisms that are not known .
In some cases , metastatic potential of tumor cells has been correlated with reduced nm23 expression ( 20-23 ) .
In other tumor types , over-expression of nm23 correlates with metastatic spread ( 24-28 ) .
The nm23 gene products are also involved in the control of cell proliferation , differentiation , and development ( 29-31 ) .
These proteins contain nucleoside diphosphate kinase enzyme activity ( 32-35 ) .
Nm23 proteins interact with GTP-binding proteins ( 35 , 36 ) , and they also function as transcription factors ( 37 ) .
The transcription factor , PuF , was identified as the Nm23H2 protein ( 37 ) .
This transcription factor binds to a site at - 142 to -115 upstream of the ec-mye P1 promoter ( the PuF site ) .
It has been shown to regulate e-mye transcription in vitro and is required for ir vitro transcription from both promoters P1 and P2 ( 38 , 39 ) .
The nucleoside diphosphate kinase enzyme activity is not required for the DNA binding and in vitro transcriptional activity of Nm23H2 ( 40 ) .
We have now demonstrated that the PuF site on the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma is bound by protein in vivo while the PuF site on the silent normal e-myce allele is not .
Transient transfection assays were performed to demonstrate that the PuF site functions as a positive regulatory element in B cells .

RESULTS An in Vivo Footprint Is Located Near DNase Hypersensitive Site III-1-The translocated and normal c-myc alleles from Raji cells were separated by electrophoresis , and ligation-mediated PCR was performed on each one .
With primer sets that cover the region surrounding DNase hypersensitive site III-1 , we found a footprint on the translocated c-myc allele that was not present on the normal silent c-myc allele ( Fig .

There were 13 guanine residues protected on the noncoding strand .
There are no guanine residues in this region on the coding strand .
The protected sequence contains consensus binding sites for several transcription factors , including Nm23H2 , Sp-1 , and AP-2 .

The migration of molecular mass markers is shown on the left .
The protein bands with a molecular mass of 38 and 17 kDa are identified as the UV cross-linked complex formed with Nm23H2 protein and DNA probe and the unbound Nm23H2 protein , respectively .
The 68-kDa band is BSA , which is added to the elution buffer .
There is some cross-reactivity of the antibody with BSA .

The unbound Nm23H2 protein shows a molecular mass of 17 kDa , as indicated by the arrow .
mine whether there were any differences in the proteins present in Burkitt 's cells versus a B cell line lacking a translo-cation of the e-mye gene .
One major complex was formed with 13395 both DHL-9 and Raji nuclear extract and the F50 probe ( CT in Fig .
2A ) .
Three complexes were formed with both B cell nuclear extracts and the oligonucleotide ( C2 , C3 , and C4 in Fig .
2B ) .
An excess of unlabeled cold self-competitor diminished the intensity of each of the complexes , while an irrelevant oligonucleotide , which contained the Myb binding site , had little effect on C1 and C2 , but it did compete for formation of complexes C3 and C4 ( Fig .
2 , A and B ) .
We believe that the C3 and C4 complexes are nonspecific interactions .
The PuF probe competed for the formation of complex C1 seen with the F50 probe ( Fig .
2A ) .
An excess of unlabeled F50 probe competed for formation of complex C2 formed with the PuF probe ( Fig .
2B ) .
Thus , the same protein or proteins were most likely present in the C1 complex formed with the F50 fragment and the C2 complex formed with the PuF probe .
The F50 and PuF probes contain consensus binding sites for several transcription factors , so further studies were performed to identify the relevant proteins .
An antibody that is reactive with both Nm23H1 and Nm23H2 was used in the EMSA to determine whether Nm23H2 protein was present in complexes C1-C4 .
As shown in Fig .
3 , A and B , the addition of preimmune serum had little effect on either complex , while the antibody against Nm23H1/Nm23H2 disrupted both complexes C1 and C2 .
No supershifted complex was visible , so it is possible that the antibody interfered with the ability of Nm23H2 to bind to DNA .
There was no consistent effect on complexes C3 and C4 , and there was no effect with an irrelevant antibody against Ets-1 ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) .
To confirm that Nm23H2 bound to the F50 and PuF probes , UV cross-linking and Western analysis were performed .
UV cross-linking followed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed first .
A protein of molecular mass 38 kDa was observed with both the complex C1 with the 50-bp F50 fragment and the complex C2 with the PuF oligonucleotide of the protected region ( 38 kDa in Fig .
4B ) .
The 38-kDa protein reacted with the Nm23H1/Nm23H2 antibody on Western ( Fig .
4A ) .
In addition , protein which was present in the EMSA complex and was not UV cross-linked to DNA was also observed ( 17 kDa band in Fig .
4A ) .
These two proteins correspond to the size of Nm23H2 , either cross-linked to DNA ( 38 kDa ) or free ( 17 kDa ) .
The Western analysis performed without UV cross-linking of the protein to DNA demonstrated that the molecular mass of the protein in complexes C1 and C2 was 17 kDa ( Fig .
4C ) .
In both Western analyses , proteins of higher molecular mass reacted with the Nm23H1/Nm23H2 antibody ( The 68-kDa protein is BSA , which is added to the elution buffer ; there is some cross-reactivity of the antibody with BSA ) .
The significance of the other proteins is not clear , and proteins of this size are not observed cross-linked to DNA ( Fig .
4B ) .
We conclude that Nm23H2 is present in complexes C1 and C2 and that there is no evidence for Nm23H2 in either the C3 or C4 complexes ( Fig .
4 , A-C ) .
Protection of the PuF Binding Site Is Seen in Vitro-In vitro methylation interference was performed to locate the guanine residues required for protein binding in vitro .
With the F50 probe , methylation of seven guanine residues interfered with protein binding ( Fig .
5A ) .
In complex C2 formed with the PuF probe , methylation of essentially all of the guanine residues interfered with protein binding ( Fig .
5B ) .
This is very similar to the pattern observed in vivo ( Fig .
1 ) .
The Nm23H2 Site Is Functional in B Cells-The e-mye promoter is active in both DHL-9 and Raji cells .
We had shown that Nm23H2 bound to the e-mye PuF site , and we wished to determine whether the Nm23H2 binding site had any functional activity in B cells .
Mutations were introduced into either the 5'- or 3'-half of the PuF site ( see Fig .

The lanes are labeled as described above for panel A. c-mye promoter activity by approximately 65 % in DHL-9 and Raji cells ( Fig .
6B ) .
Mutation of both the 5'- and 3'-halves of the sites simultaneously led to a drop in activity of approximately 75 % ( Fig .
6B ) .
Deletion of a 50-bp region of the c-myc promoter , which encompasses the PuF site ( -148 to -98 , DMC1 mutant in Fig .
6A ) resulted in a decrease in activity of approximately 85 % in both B cell lines ( Fig .
6C ) relative to the -148 construct ( DMC2 mutant in Fig .
6A ) .
We conclude that the PuF site is active in B cells .
DISCUSSION In vivo footprinting has been used to identify a region near DNase hypersensitive site III-1 , which is protected on the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
The normal e-mye allele , which is transcriptionally silent , does not show any protection in this area .
We have shown by several different techniques that Nm23H2 in B cell nuclear extracts binds to this sequence in vitro .
The PuF transcription factor was originally identified and purified from HeLa cells ( 38 ) .
PuF was subsequently shown to be identical to Nm23H2 ( 37 ) .
An antibody against Nm23H1/Nm23H2 disrupted the complexes formed in EMSA with both the F50 probe and the PuF oligonucleotide .
No supershifted complex was visible ; it is possible that binding of the antibody blocks the DNA binding domain of Nm23H2 .
Both preimmune serum and an antibody against Ets-1 had no effect on the EMSA complexes .
A protein of molecular mass 17 kDa was shown to bind to both the F50 probe and the PuF oligonucleotide ; this is the size of Nm23H2 .
In addition , Western analysis revealed that this protein was recognized by the Nm23H1/Nm23H2 antibody .
Methylation interference revealed that the guanine residues in the PuF sequence were required for protein binding , and the footprint was very similar to the one we obtained in vivo .
It is not clear why only guanine residues in the 3'-half of the PuF site interfere with binding in vitro with the F50 probe .
Differences in secondary structure between the longer fragment and the shorter oligonucleotide may be involved .
EMSA with the PuF oligonucleotide yielded three complexes , and only complex C2 contained Nm23H2 protein .
A single complex with Nm23H2 was observed with the 50-bp fragment .
Differences in protein binding between longer DNA fragments and shorter oligonucleotides has been observed previously for the PuF factor ( 38 ) .
We have demonstrated that the PuF site has functional activity in B cells .
Mutation of either half of the site led to a 0 FSO MP1 MP2 MP3 0 PUF MP1 MP2 MP3 13397 B PUF Probe MP1 Probe MP2 Probe MP3 Probe Js t im -a i > < -- - » 0 Eso PUF 0 FS0o PUF 0 FSO PUF wis u » , H M MB _ .. , « » # -- = 60 7 8s 9 10 10 2 3 40 50 60 70 8 9 drop in e-mye promoter activity of approximately 55-65 % .
Mutations of both halves simultaneously decreased promoter activity by 75 % .
Deletion of this region also caused a dramatic decrease in activity ( approximately 85 % ) .
We have previously observed an in vivo footprint over the PuF site in proliferating HL60 cells ( 43 ) .
This footprint was not present in differentiated HL60 cells that no longer expressed c-myc .
Our results in B cells demonstrate that this site functions as a positive regulatory region .
These results are consistent with the findings in HL60 cells , although there is currently no evidence to suggest that the PuF site plays a role in retention or read-through of RNA polymerase II at the transcription start site ( 52 , 53 ) .
Because the PuF site functions as a positive regulatory element in B cells , we speculate that it is involved in the expression of the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
This site is unoccupied in the normal e-myc allele .
Previously identified differences in DNase I hypersensitive sites between the two e-myc alleles in Burkitt 's lymphoma have been described ( 54-56 ) .
Of particular interest is the absence of DNase hypersensitive site III-1 in the normal c-myc allele .
These results suggest that the chromatin conformation is different in each allele , and it is possible that the conformation of the normal allele prevents protein binding to the PuF site located close to DNase hypersensitive site III-1 .
It is also possible that differences in methylation of the two e-mye alleles account for the differential protein binding to the PuF site , which we have observed .
It is likely that the deregulation of the translocated e-mye allele is a consequence of interactions between the c-myc promoter region and regulatory elements of the immunoglobulin locus .
We have previously identified two NF- « B sites in the c-mye promoter that are occupied only on the translocated allele and that function as positive regulatory elements ( 19 ) .
Regulatory elements in both the human immunoglobulin x locus and the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain locus have been described that lead to increased e-mye expression and the shift in promoter usage from P2 to P1 ( 17 , 18 ) .
We are currently investigating the interaction between these regulatory elements and the transcription factor binding sites that we have identified on the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
