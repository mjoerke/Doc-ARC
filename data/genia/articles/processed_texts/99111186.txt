Changes in c-fos expression induced by radiation therapy in tumor tissues have not yet been reported .
In this study , we have attempted to determine whether c-fos expression is induced by radiotherapy in human squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to establish a possible correlation between c-fos expression and the therapeutic effects of radiation therapy .
Twenty-seven patients with tumors of the oral cavity , oro-pharynx , and maxillary sinus were examined , all of which were confirmed as squamous cell carcinomas .
After obtaining the patients ' informed consent , biopsies were performed before treatment and at doses of 4 , 10 , and 20 Gy of radiotherapy , and the specimens were preserved in liquid nitrogen for further examination .
Serial sectioning of 6 um was performed using a cryostat , and samples were immunohis-tochemically stained using the streptoavidin-biotin peroxidase method and a monoclonal antibody against c-fos .
Three of the 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma showed slight expression of c-fos in their tumor cells before and/or at 4 or 10 Gy of radiotherapy .
The tumors showed high radiosensitivity , Concerning tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes , the rate of moderate or remarkable grades of c-fos-positive lymphocytes before radiotherapy and at radiation doses of 4 , 10 , and 20 Gy was 8.0 , 29.2 , 4.8 , and 0 % , respectively .

In patients whose infiltration of c-fos-positive lymphocytes into tumor tissues were moderate or remarkable at 4 Gy of radiotherapy , the tumors responded significantly well to radiation therapy ( P < 0.025 , x test ) , and the patients took a significantly favorable clinical course ( P < 0.05 , x test ) .
In a sample from one of the patients , c-fos-positive lymphocytes were identified as CD4 positive and CD8 negative .
Therefore , the high radiosensitivity of squamous cell carcinomas in our samples could be explained by an overexpression of c-fos in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes induced by small doses of radiation therapy , and these activated lymphocytes exerted a cytotoxic effect against the cancer cells .
INTRODUCTION C-fos is an early response gene , the expression of which is induced rapidly and transiently by growth factors and mitogens ( 1 ) .
Expression of the gene has also been induced by exposing mammalian cells to ionizing and UV irradiation ( 2-4 ) .
Although the expression of c-fos has been confirmed in several percentages of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck ( 5 ) , changes in c-fos expression induced by radiation therapy have not yet been identified .
Vrdoljak et al .
( 6 ) have reported that doses of up to 20 Gy have no effect on the c-fos , c-jun , and jun-B mRNA levels in two rat brain tumor cell lines , in contrast to rat astrocytes , on which c-fos expression was induced after 1 Gy of X-ray irradiation .
Therefore , the possibility that c-fos expression is involved with the radiosensitivity of tumor cells has been considered to be relatively low .
In this report , we have studied changes in the c-fos expression of tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes during radiation therapy using an immunohistochemical method and a monoclonal antibody against c-fos .
It is possible that c-fos-positive lymphocytes are induced by small doses of radiotherapy in some types of tumors that exhibit a high degree of radiosensitivity .
Thus , our study has attempted to evaluate the c-fos expression of tumor cells and/or infiltrating lymphocytes that is induced by low-dose irradiation of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to evaluate the possible correlation between the expression of the oncogene and the therapeutic effects of radiation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 27 patients with malignancies of the head and neck regions were examined ( Table 1 ) .

patients ' informed consent , pieces of approximately 0.3 X 0.3 x 0.3 cm were cut from obviously viable portions of the tumors before and after the delivery of 4 , 10 , and 20 Gy ( cumulative doses ) of irradiation .
All of the tumors were histopathologically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas .
Samples from these tissue specimens were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen and subsequently cut into 6-jum-thick serial sections in the cryostat .
These sections were immunohis-tochemically stained by the streptoavidin-biotin peroxidase method using a Histofine SAB-PO kit ( Nichirei Co. , Tokyo , Japan ) according to the instruction manual .
A monoclonal antibody against c-fos ( clone NCL-Fos ; IgM fraction of the mouse monoclonal antibody ) was also used .
The antibody was purchased from Medac Diagnostika Co. ( Hamburg , Germany ; Refs .
7 and 8 ) .
The procedure has been described elsewhere ( 9 , 10 ) .
The serial sections were also similarly incubated with mouse gamma globulin ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St Louis , MO ) instead of the anti-c-fos monoclonal antibody and without the primary antibody to exclude nonspecific staining .
The specificity of anti-c-fos has been examined previously ( 7 , 8 ) .
Irradiation was administered with 4-MV X-rays on an ML-15MDX linear accelerator ( Mitsubishi Electric Co. , Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Treatments were performed five times a week , with a daily dosage of 2 Gy .
The grade of expression of the c-fos protein in the tumor cells was evaluated according to the following standards : 0 % , - ; < 10 % , + ; 10-50 % , ++ ; > 50 % , +++ .
The grade was estimated by the percentages of c-fos-positive tumor cells on five X200 color photographs .

The relationship between the immunohistochemical findings and the therapeutic effect of cumulative doses of 20 Gy of radiotherapy was examined on corresponding H & E-stained sections .
RESULTS Before and during radiation therapy , none of the tumor tissues showed staining grades of ++ or +++ of c-fos expres-sion .
Three of the patients showed a slight expression of c-fos in their tumor cells before and/or at 4 or 10 Gy of radiotherapy , and their tumors showed high radiosensitivity ( Table 2 ) .
Despite the low levels of c-fos expression in the tumor cells , the degree of c-fos-positive lymphocytes infiltrating tumor tissues was significantly increased at 4 Gy compared with that before radiotherapy ( P < 0.05 , x* test ) .
With regard to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes , the rates of tumor specimens of moderate or remarkable grades of c-fos-positive lymphocytes were 8.0 ( 2 of 25 ) , 29.2 ( 7 of 24 ) , 4.8 ( 1 of 21 ) , and 0 % ( 0 of 20 ) before radiation therapy and at cumulative doses of 4 , 10 , and 20 Gy of radiotherapy , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
Patients showing moderate or remarkable grades of infil- tration of c-fos-positive lymphocytes into their tumor tissues at 4 Gy responded significantly well to radiation therapy ( P < 0.025 , X2 test ) and took a favorable clinical course ( P < 0.05 , x2 test ) compared to other patients with none or slight grades of infiltration ( Table 3 ) .

At a 4-Gy cumulative dose of irradiation , the infiltration of the c-fos-positive lymphocytes into tumor tissues was remarkable , and the tumor cells showed a slight expression of c-fos .
At a 10-Gy cumulative dose of irradiation , most of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and the tumor cells showed pyknosis on their H & E-stained sections , which was considered to be characteristic of apoptosis , and these cells showed nonspecific staining , possibly due to endogenous peroxidase ( magnification , x200 ) .
DISCUSSION The expression of c-fos mRNA in experimental cell lines has been reported to be augmented by many types of stresses , including UV irradiation , ionizing radiation , and heat ( 2-4 , 12 ) .
There are still a few reports , however , of c-fos expression in tumor tissue .
In most osteosarcoma cells and in some types of leukemia cell lines , the expression of c-fos mRNA has been identified ( 13 , 14 ) .
Therefore , possible involvement of c-fos expression in tumor cells in the proliferation mechanisms of these tumors has been speculated .
Because the half-life of c-fos is relatively short ( approxi-mately 30 min ) , the immunohistochemical detection of c-fos is quite difficult , and there have been few reports of c-fos expression in tumor tissues ( 15 ) .
Only one article has reported an alteration in c-fos expression after the irradiation of solid tumor tissues ( 5 ) .
In the article , Miura et al .
( 5 ) reported that the rate of c-fos expression in tumor tissues of the head and neck was relatively low and seemed to be unaffected by radiation therapy .
Their specimens , however , were obtained only before and after radiation therapy .
In a previous paper , we examined the sequential alteration of proto-oncogene mRNA expression in the liver , spleen , kid ney , and brain of mice after whole-body irradiation of 7 Gy ( 16 ) .
The mRNAs examined in the study were fas , c-fos , c-myc , bel-2 , and p53 .
In this study , c-fos mRNA expression decreased 2 h after irradiation and increased remarkably thereafter in the spleen , possibly due to the activation of splenic lymphocytes .
In the other organs that were examined , such an increase in c-fos mRNA expression was not observed .
It was therefore considered to be important to examine the expression of c-fos in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes induced by low doses of radiotherapy .
For this reason , we have attempted to measure the grade of c-fos expression in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of the head and neck before radiation therapy and serially during radiotherapy .
Because of its relatively short half-life , and because it is expressed immediately after several kinds of extracellular stimuli in its role as a signal transduction mediator , the expression of c-fos must be detected as soon as possible after the stimuli .
Therefore , the detection of c-fos expression in tumor tissues after radiation therapy has given no meaningful results .
As shown by our results , c-fos expression is observed mostly in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and is rarely observed Downloaded from clincancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

in tumor cells at low doses of radiation .
Moreover , the c-fos-positive lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor tissues have been identified as CD4 positive and CD8 negative .
Therefore , these c-fos-positive lymphocytes are considered to be activated helper/inducer T lymphocytes , which have been reported in our previous paper as a possible predictor of a favorable response to radiation therapy ( 9 , 10 ) .
As mentioned above , the c-fos-positive lymphocytes are induced at low doses of radiation therapy and disappear at cumulative doses of 20 Gy in the tumor tissues of head and neck cancer patients , whose tumors respond well to radiation therapy .
Therefore , the appearance of c-fos-positive lymphocytes in tumor tissues at low doses of radiotherapy possibly predicts a favorable clinical course for the patient and may be considered as an independent predictor for radiation therapy .
