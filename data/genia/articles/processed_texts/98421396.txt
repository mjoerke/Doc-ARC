Interleukin-4 and -13 Induce Upregulation of the Murine Macrophage 12/15-Lipoxygenase Activity : Evidence for the Involvement of Transcription Factor STAT6 By Dagmar Heydeck , Leo Thomas , Kerstin Schnurr , Frank Trebus , William E. Thierfelder , James N. Ihle , and Hartmut Kuhn When human monocytes or alveolar macrophages are cultured in the presence of interleukin ( IL ) -4 or IL-13 , the expression of the reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase is in-duced .
In mice a 15-lipoxygenase is not expressed , but a leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase is present in peritoneal macrophages .
To investigate whether both lipoxygenase iso-forms exhibit a similar regulatory response toward cytokine stimulation , we studied the regulation of the leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase of murine peritoneal macrophages by interleukins and found that the activity of this enzyme is upregulated in a dose-dependent manner when the cells were cultured in the presence of the IL-4 or IL-13 but not by IL-10 .
When peripheral murine monocytes that do not express the lipoxygenase were treated with IL-4 expression of 12/15-lipoxygenase mRNA was induced , suggesting pretranslational control mechanisms .
In contrast , no upregulation of the lipoxygenase activity was observed when the macrophages were prepared from homozygous STAT6-deficient mice .
Peritoneal macrophages of transgenic mice that sys- IPOXYGENASES ( LOXs ) constitute a family of lipid peroxidizing enzymes that catalyze the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids to their corresponding hydroperoxy derivatives . ``
According to the currently used nomenclature , these enzymes are classified according to their reaction specific-ity of arachidonic acid oxygenation.. `` 5-LOXs oxygenate arachidonic acid at C & of the fatty acid backbone , whereas 12-and 15-lipoxygenases introduce molecular dioxygen at C ; , and C ; 5 , respectively .
This arachidonic acid-related nomenclature suffers from several disadvantages , which may lead to confusion among scientists not working in the field .
One of these problems is the diversity of arachidonate 12- and 15-LOXs .
The platelet-type 12-LOX strongly differs from the leukocyte-type 12-LOX with respect to its protein chemical and enzymatic properties .
'~ Similarly , the human epidermis-type 15-LOX `` is different from the reticulocyte-type 15-LOX of the same species . ``
'' On the other hand , the murine , `` porcine , `` and bovine ! ``
leukocyte-type 12-LOXs share a high degree of structural homology with the reticulocyte-type 15-LOX of rabbits and humans , suggesting that the leukocyte-type 12-LOXs of mouse , pig , and cattle may be functionally related to the reticulocyte-type 15-LOXs of other species .
5-LOXs play a major role in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes , which are important mediators of anaphylactic and inflammatory diseases . ``
In contrast , the physiological importance of 12-and 15-LOXs is not as well-investigated .
In rabbit reticulocytes the 15-LOX was implicated in the maturational breakdown of mitochondria during red-cell development . ``
The high-level expression of the enzyme in mature macrophages'* and its absence in the precursor monocytes `` suggests a role in monocyte/macrophage transition or in macrophage function .
Recently , 15-LOXs have been implicated in atherogenesis because of their capability of oxidizing low-density lipoprotein to an atherogenic form . ``
'' The expression of 15-LOX in mammalian cells is highly Blood , Vol 92 , No 7 ( October 1 ) , 1998 : pp 2503-2510 temically overexpress IL-4 exhibited a threefold to fourfold higher 12-lipoxygenase activity than cells prepared from control animals .
A similar upregulation of 12-lipoxygenase activity was detected in heart , spleen , and lung of the transgenic animals .
Moreover , a strong induction of the enzyme was observed in red cells during experimental anemia in mice .
The data presented here indicate that ( 1 ) the 12-lipoxygenase activity of murine macrophages is upregulated in vitro and in vivo by IL-4 and/or IL-13 , ( 2 ) this upregulation requires expression of the transcription factor STAT6 , and ( 3 ) the constitutive expression of the enzyme appears to be STAT6 independent .
The cytokine-dependent upregulation of the murine macrophage 12-lipoxygenase and its induction during experimental anemia suggests its close relatedness with the human reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase despite their differences in the positional speci-ficity of arachidonic acid oxygenation .

regulated . ``
In rabbit reticulocytes a 15-LOX mRNA binding protein ( 15-LOX-BP ) has been identified'* `` `` that binds to a characteristic repetitive motif in the 3'-untranslated region of the 15-LOX mRNA , `` preventing its translation .
In human peripheral monocytes'*2 ' and alveolar macrophages `` the enzyme is upregulated when the cells were cultured in vitro in the presence of interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) or IL-13 .
Other cytokines such as IL-1 $ , IL-2 , IL-3 , and IL-10 were ineffective . ``
A similar cytokine-dependent 15-LOX induction was recently observed in the human lung carcinoma cell line A549 but was not detected in various human and murine monocytic cell lines . ``
Because the induction was shown by Northern blot analysis , by immunoblotting , and by activity assays , pretranslational control mechanisms are involved .
In mouse peritoneal macrophages a linoleic acid & -6 lipoxygenase activity has been described that was also upregulated by IL-4 . ``

2504 mechanism of cytokine-induced 15-LOX expression is not well understood .
Experiments with IL-4 receptor antagonists suggested that the IL-4 and/or IL-13 cell surface receptor ( s ) appear to be involved . ``
However , almost nothing is known about the intracellular events leading to expression of the 15-LOX in any cellular system .
Moreover , there is no experimental evidence suggesting that IL-4-induced upregulation of 12-/15-LOXs does actually occur in vivo .
To address this questions and to obtain more detailed information on the mechanism of cytokine-induced LOX expression , peritoneal macrophages and peripheral monocytes were prepared from normal mice and from genetically modified animals , and the impact of cytokine stimulation on the 12/15-LOX activity was measured .
The data obtained suggest that IL-4 upregulates the activity of the murine leukocyte-type 12-LOX in vitro and in vivo .
Moreover , we found that IL-4-and IL-13-induced upregulation requires the expression of STAT6 transcription factor .
However , the constitutive background activity of the enzyme appears to be STAT6 independent .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals .
- The chemicals used were purchased from the following vendors : recombinant murine and human interleukins-4 , -10 , and -13 from R & D Systems GmbH ( Wiesbaden , Germany ) ; cell culture media from GIBCO-BRL ( Eggenstein , Germany ) ; methanol , n-hexane , and 2-propanol ( HPLC pure ) from Baker ( Gross-Gerau , Germany ) ; and authentic standards of 128- , 12R- , 158- , and 15R-HETE and arachidonic acid from Cayman Chem ( Ann Arbor , MD .
Animal experiments .
- STAT6 deficient mice ( ~/~ ) were produced and maintained as described previously .
? ``
For knocking out the STAT6 gene , clones from a 129/SvE genomic library were injected into C57BL/6 blastocytes .
All mice were 129/C57 Black mixtures , and age-matched female individuals of STAT6-deficient mice and controls with comparable genetic background were used for the experiments .
IL-4-overexpressing transgenic mice** `` `` as well as the corresponding inbred controls were kindly provided by Dr A. Schimpl ( Wiirzburg , Germany ) .
Experimental anemia was induced in mice by repeated subcutaneous injection of a neutralized phenylhydracine solution .
The mice were killed by diethyl ether inhalation and blood was removed from the Vena cava inferior .
The cells were spun down and washed twice with isotonic saline , and 0.1 mL of packed cells were resuspended in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) .
Arachidonic acid oxygenase activity was assayed as described for peritoneal macrophages ( see below ) .
Cell preparation and culturing conditions .
Mice were killed by carbon dioxide or diethyl ether inhalation .
Peritoneal macrophages were prepared by peritoneal lavage with 10 mL of sterile PBS .
The cells were spun down , washed once with sterile PBS , resuspended in Dulbecco 's minimal essential medium ( DMEM ) containing penicillin/streptomycin and 10 % fetal calf serum and plated to 6-well culture dishes or normal Petri-dishes at a concentration of about 1 X 10° cells/well .
The macrophages were allowed to adhere to the dishes ( 2 to 3 hours ) , the nonadherent cells were removed , and the cells were kept in culture for up to 96 hours .
Fluorescence-associated cell sorting analysis of the adherent cells indicated that more than 80 % of the cells were stained positive for the macrophage surface antigen CD11b .
The culture medium was changed after 24 and 76 hours .
Interleukins were added to the culture medium after the cells were kept in culture for 24 hours .
After different times the cells were detached by trypsination for 10 minutes ( addition of 2 mL trypsin/versene solution ; BioWit-thaker , Verviers , Belgium ) or by scraping them from the dishes .
Then the HEYDECK ET AL cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS .
Murine peripheral monocytes were prepared from whole blood by density step-gradient centrifugation and adherence to plastic dishes as described for human monocytes . ``
For the experiments heparin-blood of 20 mice was combined .
Murine alveolar macrophages were obtained by broncho-alveolar lavage with three 1-mL rinses of PBS .
The cell suspensions were combined and the cells were washed with PBS and were further treated as described above for the peritoneal macrophages .
LOX activity assay .
- Arachidonic acid ( final concentration of 20 umol/L or 100 pmol/L ) was added as LOX substrate to the cell suspension as methanolic stock solution , and either the intact cells or a cell homogenate ( sonication with a microtip sonifier [ Brown AG , Melsungen , Germany ] ) were incubated with the substrate for 15 minutes at 37°C .
The samples were acidified to pH 3 , and the lipids were extracted with an equal volume of ethylacetate or with a 2:1 ( vol/vol ) mixture of methanol/chloroform .
After centrifugation , the organic phase containing the lipophilic LOX products was recovered , the solvent was evaporated under vacuum , and the remaining lipids were reconstituted in 0.1 mL of methanol .
Aliquots ( usually half of the sample ) were injected to reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatog-raphy ( RP-HPLC ) for quantification of the LOX products .
HPLC analysis .
HPLC was performed on a Waters ( Eschborn , Germany ) or a Shimadzu ( Kyoto , Japan ) HPLC system connected to diode array detectors .
If not stated otherwise , RP-HPLC was performed on Nucleosil C-18 column ( Macherey/Nagel , Diiren , Germany ; KS-system , 250 X 4 mm , 5 um particle size ) .
The analytes were eluted isocratically with the solvent system methanol/water/acetic acid ( 85/157 0.1 ; by volume ) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min .
The absorbance at 235 nm was recorded .
The chromatograms were quantified by peak area , and a calibration curve ( six-point calibration ) for 12-HETE was established .
The fractions containing the LOX products were collected , and the solvent was evaporated .
The lipids were reconstituted in 0.2 mL of n-hexane , and aliquots were injected to straight-phase ( SP ) -HPLC and/or chiral-phase HPLC .
SP-HPLC was performed on a Nucleosil column ( Macherey/Nagel ; KS-system , 250 X 4 mm , 10 um particle size ) with a solvent system of n-hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid ( 100/2/ 0.1 ; by volume ) and a flow rate of 1 mL/min .
The hydroxy fatty acid enantiomers were separated on a Chiralcel-OD column ( Baker , Germany ) using the solvent systems n-hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid ( 100:5:0.1 ; by volume ) for 15-HETE and n-hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid ( 100:3:0.1 ; by volume ) for 12-HETE .
The chemical structures of the hydroxy fatty acid isomers were identified by ultraviolet spectros-copy , by coinjections with authentic standards in RP- and SP-HPLC , and by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( GC/MS ) .
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) .
- Total RNA was prepared by guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction and was stored as ethanol precipitates at -20°C .
The cDNAs were obtained by reverse-transcription using the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( AMV-RT ) and oligo ( dT ) as primer .
PCR was performed on a Biometra TRIO Thermoblock 2.51BB ( Biometra , Gottingen , Germany ) .
Total RNA ( 3 ug ) was reverse transcribed at 37°C for 90 minutes in 45 uL of 50 mmol/L Tris/HCl buffer , pH 8.2 , containing 8 mmol/L MgCl , , 30 mmol/L KCI , 1 mmol/L DTT , 100 ug/mL bovine serum albumin , 30 U of RNase inhibitor , 0.166 mmol/L of each dNTP , 150 pmol of oligo ( dT ) primer , and 15 U of reverse transcriptase .
To stop the reaction samples were heated to 95°C for 10 minutes .
For quantification the mRNA of the murine 12/15-LOX was related to the glycerolaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) mRNA .
As housekeeping enzyme , the GAPDH mRNA may not be regulated by cytokines .
For amplification of the 12/15-LOX and of the GAPDH the following primer combinations were used : 5-CTC CCT GTA GAC CAG CGA TTT CGA -3 ' and 5-GGC AGT TCG AGC TGG ATG GCT ATA ( 12/15-LOX ; expecting a 484-bp fragment ) and 5'-TCG GTG TGA ACG GAT TTG GCC GTA-3 ' and 5-ATG GAC TGT GGT CAT GAG CCC TTC-3 ' ( GAPDH , expecting a 521-bp fragment ) .

RESULTS The activity of the leukocyte-type 12-LOX of murine peritoneal macrophages is upregulated in vitro by IL-4 and IL-13 .
The expression of the reticulocyte-type 15-LOX of human peripheral monocytes'* ** and of alveolar macrophages `` is induced when the cells were cultured in vitro in the presence of IL-4 and/or IL-13 .
We analyzed the 12/15-LOX activity of murine peritoneal lavage cells ( Fig 1 , upper trace ) and found that a cell lysate converted exogenous arachidonic acid to products comigrating in RP-HPLC with authentic standards of ( 57,87,106,147 ) -125-hydroxyeicosa-5,8,10,14-tetraenoic acid ( 12S-HETE ) and ( 5 % ,87,117,13B ) -155-hydroxyeicosa-5,8,11 , 13-tetraenoic acid ( 158-HETE ) .

After addition of arachidonic acid ( 100 pmol/L final concentration ) , the cells were disrupted and the lysate was incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C .

with intact cells , but the extent of product formation was somewhat lower ( data not shown ) .
The products contained a characteristic conjugated diene chromophore with an absorbance maximum at 236 nm ( inset ) .
Because under these chromatographic conditions the different positional HETE isomers were not well-resolved , SP-HPLC was performed to confirm the chemical structures .
This analytical procedure indicated a 8:1 mixture of 12-HETE and 15-HETE .
In this particular experiment , 0.98 ug 12/15-HETE per 10° cells was formed within a 15-minute incubation period .
In the corresponding control incubation ( no cells ) , very small amounts of oxygenated fatty acids were detected ( Fig 1 , lower trace ) .
Formation of 12-and 15-HETE was completely inhibited by the LOX inhibitor 5,8,11 , l14-eicosatetraynoic acid but was not affected by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin ( data not shown ) .
When linoleic acid was used as substrate , ( 9Z,11E ) -138-hydroxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid was identified as major oxygenation product ( data not shown ) .
Peritoneal macrophages that were cultured for 4 days in the presence of 0.8 nmol/L IL-4 ( Fig 2 , upper trace ) produce more 12/15-HETE than cells cultured in the absence of the cytokine ( lower trace ) .
In this particular experiment , a fourfold increase in 12/15-HETE formation was observed , whereas 5-HETE formation remained unchanged .
The ultraviolet-spectra ( right inset ) of the major conjugated dienes formed ( 12-HETE and 15-HETE ) were similar in shape but were slightly different with respect to their A , , , , -values .

2506 15-HETE a A , , , , of 235 nm was determined , whereas maximal absorption for the late eluting 12-HETE was at 236 nm . ``
Analysis of the enantiomer composition of 12-HETE ( left inset ) indicated a preponderance of the S-isomer , suggesting that the compound was formed via LOX pathway .
From Fig 3 it can be seen that the extent of upregulation of the 12/15-LOX activity did depend on the IL-4 concentration .
A tendency of activation was already seen at 1 and 10 pmol/L , but significant upregulation was observed at IL-4 concentrations of 100 pmol/L and higher .
It should be mentioned that the 12-HETE/15-HETE ratio was about 10:1 over the entire concentration range .
For the human 15-LOX it has been shown that the enzyme is induced by IL-4 and IL-13 , whereas other cytokines , such as IL-10 , had no effects .
From Table 1 it can be seen that the murine macrophage 12/15-LOX exhibits a similar cytokine responsiveness .
To find out whether the upregulation of 12/15-LOX activity is paralelled by an increase in the steady-state concentration of the 12/15-LOX protein , immunohistochemical stainings were performed .
We found that both IL-4-treated and -untreated peritoneal macrophages were stained 12/15-LOX positive .
Although the staining appeared to be somewhat more intense with the IL-4-treated cells , exact quantification was not possible .

Peritoneal lavage cells were prepared from 30 mice by rinsing the peritoneal cavity of each mouse with 10 mL of PBS .
The lavage fluid was pooled , the cells were washed once , plated in 6-well plates , and the macrophages were allowed to adhere overnight .
After removing nonadherent cells , different concentrations of IL-4 were adjusted and the cells were kept in culture for additional 3 days .
For most IL-4 concentra-tions , three separate wells were used .
After 3 days the cells from each well were obtained separately and the arachidonic acid oxygenase activity was determined .
12- and 15-HETE formation was quantified by RP-HPLC .
The n-numbers above the traces indicate how many wells were used for one IL-4 concentration , and the arrow bars represent the standard deviation .
At 100 pmol/L of IL-4 we measured exactly the same 15-HETE formation in both HPLC runs .
Thus , no arrow bar can be given .

The experiments with murine peritoneal macrophages were hampered by the fact that these cells constitutively express the 12/15-LOX at a fairly high level .
To avoid this problem we prepared peripheral monocytes from mice and cultured these cells for 4 days in the absence and presence of IL-4 .
Because the number of cells obtained ( 5 X 10° monocytes ) was not sufficient for activity assays , we performed RT-PCR to quantify 12/15-LOX mRNA expression .
From Fig 4 it can be seen that no 12/15-LOX mRNA is expressed in peripheral monocytes cultured for 4 days in the absence of IL-4 .
However , when IL-4 was present in the culture medium , a LOX positive band was detected .
These data suggest that in murine monocytes 12/15-LOX expression is upregulated by IL-4 and that pretranslational mechanisms appear to be involved .
In vivo upregulation of murine 12-LOX by systemic overex-pression of IL-4 .

'* ' 2 > `` 2 To find out whether this effect may actually occur in vivo we prepared peritoneal macrophages from transgenic mice that overexpress IL-4 under the control of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) -I regulatory sequences . ``
From Fig 5 it can be seen that the macrophages of transgenic mice exhibit a threefold to fourfold higher 12-LOX activity than cells prepared from the corresponding control animals .
Statistic evaluation of the data obtained from 10 individuals gave the following results : transgenics ( n = 5 ) , 12-LOX activity of 9.73 + 1.88 ug HETE/10® cells ( mean + SD ) ; controls , 2.84 + 0.88 ug HETE/10® cells ( mean + SD ) , P = .005 .
It should be stressed that the pattern of arachidonic acid oxygenation products , in particular the 15-HETE/12-HETE-ratio ( about 1:5 ) , was comparable for the transgenic mice and the control animals , suggesting that these products are formed by the same From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Enantiomer analysis of the major product of arachidonic acid oxygenation , 12-HETE , showed a strong preponderance of the S-isomer , indicating the 12-LOX origin .
These data suggest that the increased arachidonic acid oxygenating capability of the peritoneal macrophages prepared from IL-4-overexpressing mice is due to an upregulation of the 12-LOX activity .
In additional experiments we addressed the question whether the upregulation of the LOX activity was restricted to macrophages or whether an increase in enzyme activity can also 12-HETE E E $ & 8 g 0.3 é R § uo g racemic standard & ® Lu o 12-HETE isolated d LL p 0.2 retention time ( min ) T 2 f § controls A 2 2 a 0.1 ® transgenics 2 4 - _ 6 8 10 retention time ( min ) Fig 5 .

In contrast , arachidonic acid oxygenase activity was not altered in liver ( 22 ug HETE/g wet weight v 24 ug HETE/g wet weight in a control animal ) and skeleton muscle ( 17 ug HETE/g wet weight v 18 ug HETE/g wet weight in a control animal ) .
Involvement of STAT6 in IL-4-induced upregulation of 12-LOX activity .
The mechanism of IL-4-dependent upregulation of LOXs , in particular the steps of the cytokine-induced signal transduction cascade necessary for this upregulation , has not been investigated so far .
In various cellular systems IL-4-mediated effects involve activation of the transcription factor STAT6 .
In its phosphorylated form STAT6 binds to STAT6-responsive elements in the promoter region of IL-4-sensitive genes and turns on their transcription .
We screened the promoter sequences of various mammalian LOXs ( rabbit 15-LOX , `` human 15-LOX , `` murine leukocyte-type 12-LOX,8 porcine leukocyte-type 12-LOX , `` `` human 5-LOX , * platelet-type 12-LOX , `` ° murine platelet-type 12-LOX® ) for the presence of STAT6-responsive elements with the consensus sequence TTC NNN ( N ) GAA `` and found potential STAT6-binding sites in the promoter of the rabbit and human 15-LOX genes and in the genes coding for the murine and porcine leukocyte-type 12-LOXs .
In contrast , the promoters of the murine platelet 12-LOX® and of the human 5-LOX® do not contain potential STAT6-binding elements .
To find out whether STAT6 is involved in the IL-4-induced signal transduction cascade leading to the upregulation of 15-LOX activity , experiments with STAT6 deficient mice were performed .
From the data shown in Table 1 ( lower part ) the following conclusions may be drawn .

2508 First , the 12-LOX activity of peritoneal macrophages prepared from control mice was increased by about 60 % when the cells were cultured in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13 .
Second , when the macrophages were prepared from STAT6-deficient mice , the 12-LOX activity was not augmented .
In contrast , we observed a significant decrease in LOX activity after culturing the cells in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13 .
The mechanistic reasons for this impaired LOX activity in the STAT6-deficient macrophages remain unclear .
It might be possible that such an inhibitory effect does also occur in the macrophages of normal mice .
However , owing to the STAT6-dependent upregulation of 12-LOX activity , the inhibitory effect may be masked .
Finally , the level of constitutive expression of the 12-LOX ( no cytokine treatment ) in the STAT6-deficient mice was comparable with that of the control animals .
These data suggest that IL-4- and IL-13-induced upregulation of 12/15-LOX activity requires the expression of STAT6 , whereas the constitutive background expression of the enzyme does not involve this transcription factor .
Upregulation of 12/15-LOX activity during experimental The expression of the 15-LOX in rabbit reticulocytes is strongly induced during the time course of an experimental anemia . ``
'' To obtain additional evidence for the relatedness of the rabbit 15-LOX and the murine 12/15-LOX , we induced an experimental anemia in mice and assayed the LOX activity in red blood cells .
From Table 2 it can be seen that no 12/15-LOX was present in erythrocytes of untreated mice .
In contrast , when the animals were treated with phenylhydracine to induce an experimental anemia , the 12/15-LOX activity was strongly increased .
Because this upregulation was also observed by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis ( data not shown ) , one may conclude that the murine 12/15-LOX shows a similar induction behavior as the rabbit 15-LOX and thus suggests a close relatedness of both enzymes .
anemia .
DISCUSSION The leukocyte-type 12-LOX and the reticulocyte-type 15-LOX are expressed in various cells and tissues , but their Table 2 .

The injection was repeated at 4 consecutive days , and development of reticulocytosis was followed by reticulocyte counting .
The mice were allowed to recover for 3 days and were then sacrificed by diethylether inhalation .
Blood was withdrawn from the V. cava inf .
, the cells were spun down and the buffy-coat containing the white cells , and platelets was removed .
The red cells were washed with PBS , and 0.1 mL of packed cells were incubated with 0.1 mmol/L arachidonic acid for 15 minutes at 37°C .
After lipid extraction the formation of 12- and 15-HETE was quantified by RP-HPLC .
Abbreviation : ND , not determined .
HEYDECK ET AL biological role is still unclear .
There are several suggestions for the biological importance of these enzymes , which may be categorized as follows : `` ( 1 ) formation of bioactive lipid mediators from free polyenoic fatty acids with potential importance for anaphylactic and inflammatory disease ( in fact , 13-H ( P ) ODE and 15-H ( P ) ETE have been reported to exhibit proinflammatory and /or antiinflammatory activity in various cellular systems , in organ preparations , in whole animals , and in humans ) `` ** ' ; and ( 2 ) direct oxygenation of lipid-protein assem-blies , such as biomembranes and lipoproteins , `` leading to structural and functional alteration of these complexes , which may be of importance for cell development and atherogenesis . ``
In rabbit reticulocytes the 15-LOX has been implicated in the maturational breakdown of mitochondria . ``
If the leukocyte type 12-LOX in mice were the functional equivalent of this enzyme , disruption of its gene should lead to problems with erythropoiesis .
However , leukocyte-type 12-LOX-deficient mice do not have obvious abnormalities in hematopoiesis . ``
Because of the diversity of the LOX family , these data do not necessarily mean that the leukocyte-type 12-LOX may not be involved in red cell maturation because disruption of its gene may be compensated by upregulation of a functionally related LOX .
Although no reticulocyte-type 15-LOX has been cloned so far from mouse tissue , there is experimental evidence for the simultaneous expression of a leukocyte-type 12-LOX and a related reticulocyte-type 15-LOX in humans* and in rabbits . ``
If a similar LOX diversity would exist in mice , double or even multiple knockouts must be created .
The expression of the leukocyte-type 12-LOX and of the reticulocyte type 15-LOX in alveolar and peritoneal macrophages and their absence in the precursor monocytes suggested an involvement in monocyte-macrophage transition .
This differentiation process is characterized inter alia by restructuring of the cellular membrane .
For developing rabbit reticulocytes it has been shown that the 15-LOX oxygenates membrane lip-ids , `` and this enzymatic lipid peroxidation was implicated in red cell maturation . ``
Moreover , an involvement of 12/15-LOXs in macrophage function was suggested . ``
However , basic characterization of peritoneal macrophages isolated from 12-LOX-deficient mice did not reveal major dysfunction in macrophage maturation or macrophage physiology . ``
It might be possible that defects in erythropoiesis or in macrophage function may appear when the animals are challenged in certain ways .
Such experiments have not been performed so far .
With murine peritoneal macrophages we only observed a rather moderate , but statistically highly significant , increase in 12-LOX activity when the cells were exposed in vitro to IL-4 .
Summarizing our experiments , a twofold increase in the 12/15-LOX activity ( 2.1 + 0.8-fold increase [ mean + SDJ , n = 9 , P = .003 ) was found when murine peritoneal macrophages were cultured in the presence of 1 nmol/L IL-4 for 3 days .
For human peripheral monocytes ' > ** and in A549 human lung carcinoma cells , `` `` a much stronger increase ( 10- to 20-fold ) was described .
This may primarily be due to the fact that mature macrophages show a high level of constitutive 12/15-LOX expression .
In our hands , peripheral human monocytes exhibit a 15-LOX activity of less than 10 ng formation of 15-HETE/10® cells ( 15-minute incubation period ) .
After stimulation with IL-4 , up to 2 ug 15-HETE/10® cells was formed . ``
Murine From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .
For personal use only .
INTERLEUKINS AND MURINE LIPOXYGENASE peritoneal macrophages exhibit a 12-LOX activity , which varied between 2 to 10 ug formation of 12-HETE/10® cells , and stimulation with IL-4 or IL-13 did only lead to a 0.5- to 4-fold increase .
A similar rather moderate increase in LOX activity was observed when human alveolar macrophages , which also exhibit a high level constitutive 15-LOX expression , were stimulated with IL-4 . ``
Our RT-PCR studies in murine peripheral monocytes indicate that no 12/15-LOX is present in these cells but that the 12/15-LOX mRNA is expressed after IL-4 stimulation .
Because the 12/15-LOX is expressed in murine peritoneal macrophages but can not be detected in peripheral monocytes , the enzyme may be induced during monocyte/ macrophage transition .
Although this induction has now been shown in humans and mice , and might also occur in other animal species , its physiological relevance remains unclear .
The experiments with the STAT6-deficient mice provide evidence for an involvement of this STAT6 in IL-4-induced upregulation of 12/15-LOXs .
Because the genes coding for leukocyte-type 12-LOXs and for the reticulocyte-type 15-LOX contain putative STAT6-binding sites , a direct interaction of STAT6 with these LOX genes appears possible .
In contrast , the promoter regions of 5-LOX genes as well as of the genes coding for the platelet-type 12-LOXs do not contain putative STAT6-binding sequences .
Because these LOXs subtypes strongly differ from the above mentioned enzymes with respect to their enzymatic and protein chemical properties , they may exhibit a different cytokine responsiveness .
In fact , IL-4 treatment of human monocytes and A549 cells does neither induce the expression of the 5-LOX nor of the platelet-type 12-LOX .
'* `` 2 Although the existence of putative STAT6-binding sites in the promoter region of various LOX genes may point to a direct interaction of STAT6 with 12/15-LOX genes , kinetic studies on IL-4-induced 15-LOX expression in human monocytes ' `` and A549 lung carcinoma cells `` suggested that the human 15-LOX gene may not belong to the family of immediate early genes turned on by IL-4 .
After stimulation of the cells with IL-4 it takes at least several hours before an increase in the 15-LOX activity and its mRNA can be measured .
Thus , an indirect interaction of activated STAT6 with the human 15-LOX gene appears unlikely .
It might be possible that stimulation of the cells with IL-4 leads to a STAT6-dependent synthesis of a protein , which in turn upregulates the expression of the 12-/15-LOX .
In fact , at least in humans there are indications for the expression of such a regulatory protein .
