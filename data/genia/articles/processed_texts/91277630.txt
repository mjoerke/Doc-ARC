Human Tumor Necrosis Factor a Gene Regulation in Phorbol Ester Stimulated T and B Cell Lines By Anne E. Goldfeld , Jack L. Strominger , and Carolyn Doyle From the Division of Tumor Virology , Dana Farber Cancer Institute , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Summary The minimal region of the human tumor necrosis factor « ( TNF-a ) gene promoter necessary for its transcriptional induction by phorbol esters ( PMA ) in human T and B lymphocyte cell lines has been localized between -52 and +89 nucleotides ( nt ) relative to the gene 's transcriptional start site .
Comparison of these sequences to those required to mediate virus or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of the gene reveal significant differences , and thus , the sequence requirements for PMA induction are distinct from those that mediate induction by virus or LPS .
Although three sites in the TNF- promoter ( x1 , x2 , and x3 ) specifically bind the transcription factor NF- « B in lymphoid nuclear extracts , TNF- mRNA induction by PMA does not correlate with NF- « B binding activities displayed by different T and B cell lines .
Moreover , « 1-K3 can each be deleted from the TNF-a promoter with little effect on the gene 's inducibility by PMA .
Therefore , TNF-a mRNA induction by PMA , like its induction by virus and LPS , is not primarily mediated by NF- « B , but rather is mediated through other sequences and protein factors .
Surprisingly , multimers of « 1- « 3 can confer PMA inducibility on a heterologous promoter in a B ( Raji ) , but not a T ( HUT78 ) cell line .
However they are not functional on a truncated TNF- promoter , indicating that promoter context and cell type specificity influence the PMA inducible function of these NF-KB binding sites .
Human TNF-a is a cytotoxic protein that displays a wide range of biological activities that include the hemor-rhagic necrosis of certain tumors , inhibition of viral infection and a role in the mediation of septic shock ( see references 1 and 2 for review ) .
Historically thought to be a monocyte derived factor , TNF-a is also produced by circulating human peripheral B lymphocytes ( 3 ) and tonsillar B lymphocytes ( 4 ) .
In addition , certain human B cell lines produce TNF-a when stimulated by virus ( 3 ) and PMA ( 3 , 4 ) .
T cell lines have also been shown to produce TNF-a when stimulated by virus and PMA as well as by other T cell activating agents such as anti-CD3 antibody and calcium ionophore ( 5 , 6 ) .
PMA treatment of T and B lymphocytes stimulates protein kinase C activity and therefore provides a model system of lymphocyte activation ( 7 ) .
Induction of TNF-a in B cells and T cells by PMA and other inducers is also of interest in light of the role TNF- @ x itself plays in the activation and differentiation of lymphocytes and in associated processes .
For example , TNF-a promotes T cell growth and differentiation of T cells via induction of IL-2R ( 8 ) , and stimulates B cell growth and differentiation through its induction of IL-6 ( 9 ) .
In addition , TNF-a increases the expression of HIV in certain latently infected T cell lines ( reviewed in reference 10 ) .
These effects are presumably mediated through the induc- tion of a variety of transcription factors by TNF-a including T cell derived proteins that bind to NF-KB binding sites ( 11-13 ) and the growth factors fos and jun ( 14 ) .
The understanding of TNF-a gene regulation by PMA in B and T lymphocytes may therefore provide insight into these processes of lymphocyte and HIV-1 activation , as well as into mechanisms of inducible gene expression by PMA .
In addition to PMA , virus and LPS are also potent inducers of human TNF- & gene transcription ( 2 , 3 ) .
These induction processes are however distinguishable at the level of transcription .
For example , virus , LPS , and PMA differ with respect to the cell type in which they can induce TNF- mRNA expression , the distinct kinetics of TNF-o mRNA accumulation when these inducers act on the same cell type , and their differential interactions with metabolic inhibitors in the same cell type ( 3 ) .
The study of TNF-a gene regulation therefore provides an opportunity to gain insight into the transcriptional mechanisms whereby a single gene is induced by distinct pathways .
The promoter sequences required for virus and LPS induction of human TNF-a gene transcription have recently been identified ( 15 ) .
Although these sequences contain three sites ( K1 , « 2 , and K3 ) that specifically bind the transcription factor NF-KB in vitro , these sites are neither sufficient nor required for virus or LPS induction of the gene in vivo ( 15 ) .

© The Rockefeller University Press « 0022-1007/91/07/0073/09 $ 2.00 Volume 174 - July 1991 73-81 The transcription factor NF-KB was originally identified as a B cell specific binding activity required for immunoglobulin enhancer function ( 16 ) .
Subsequent studies revealed that NF-KB is present in many cell types , but it is located in the cytoplasm in a complex with an inhibitory protein called I-xB .
Treatment of these cell types with a variety of inducers including virus , LPS , and PMA leads to the disruption of the NF- « B/I- « B complex , and the translocation of active NF-kB to the nucleus where it is thought to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of numerous genes ( reviewed in reference 17 ) .
In this study the effect of PMA on the regulation of the cloned human TNF-a « gene introduced into cultured human B and T cell lines has been analyzed .
As in the case of virus and LPS induction of the human TNF-a gene , « 1-K3 are not required for the gene 's induction by PMA .
Thus , unlike other promoters containing NF-KB binding sites that are inducible by virus , LPS and PMA , the induction of the human TNF-a gene does not appear to be primarily mediated by NF-KB .
Moreover , the minimal sequences required for PMA induction of TNF-a ( -52 to +89 nucleotides [ nt ] !
relative to the mRNA cap site ) differ from those minimal sequences required for virus or LPS induction , and thus PMA induction is mediated through distinct regulatory domains .
We conclude that TNF-a gene regulation by PMA , virus , and LPS is a very complex process that involves multiple regulatory elements and transcription factors that are active in a cell type specific manner .
Materials and Methods Cell Culture , Transfection , and Induction Protocols .
- HUT78 , P30 , HPB-ALL , and Raji cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10 % FCS , glutamine , penicillin , and streptomycin .
Cells were transfected employing lipofectin reagent ( Bethesda Research Laborato-ries , Bethesda , MD ) ( 18 ) , split into two aliquots 18 h after transfection and maintained in RPMI and 10 % FCS in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml of PMA ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) for 48 h. Bacterial chloramphenicol transferase ( CAT ) assays ( 19 ) were performed .
These assays were carried out at the time of maximal level of expression post PMA induction ( data not shown ) .
Cells used for RNA analysis or nuclear extract preparation were maintained and induced with PMA as above .
RNA Analysis .
- RNA was prepared from HUT78 , P30 , HPB-ALL , and Raji cells .
Uniformly P-labeled probes were prepared as described from SP6 y-actin and T7 TNFM Bam ( 3 ) .
The y-actin probe was made to have a specific activity that was five times less than that of the TNF-a probe .
The RNA fragments were electro-phoresed on a 6 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described ( 3 ) .
Subcellular Fractionation and Mobility Shift Electrophoresis .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and binding assays were carried out as described ( 20 ) and as detailed in the figure legends .

Results PMA Induction of Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) a mRNA in Lymphocyte Cell Lines Is Cell Type Dependent .
B and T lymphocyte cell lines have previously been shown to display different patterns of TNF- mRNA expression in response to PMA ( 3 , 4 , 6 ) .
To determine whether TNF- mRNA expression and NF- « B binding activity could be correlated , four T cell lines and the mature B cell Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line , Raji were compared .
The T cell lines were chosen because they represent distinct stages of differentiation as determined by surface expression of lymphocyte antigens ( 23 , 24 ) .
The P30 cell line represents the earliest stage in T cell differentiation ( T-Blast I ) and is TIT * ( terminal transferase activity ) , CD7 * , and MHC class II* with no detectable y or 6 T cell rearrangements ( M. Krangel , personal communi-cation ) .
HPB-ALL ( T Blast II ) is TIT *+ , CD4* , CD8* , and af TR * ( 24 ) .
Jurkat ( T Blast III ) is TIT * , CD4 * , and B TcR+ ( 24 ) .
HUT78 represents the most terminally 'acti-vated ' T cell phenotype ( T-Blast V ) and is TIT- , CD4 , MHC class II* and CD3* , but « f TeR- ( 24 ) .
These T and B cell lines were mock or PMA-induced and accurately initiated TNF- mRNA was determined as previously described ( 3 ) .

PMA induction of TNF- gene expression in human T cell lines .
HUT78 , HBP-ALL , P30 , Jurkat , and Raji cells were either mock { ( - ) or PMA ( + ) induced and quantitative RNase mapping of TNF- @ and y-actin mRNAs was carried out with 25 ug of total cellular RNA as described ( 3 ) .
The probe T7TNFMBam was used to map TNF-o mRNA levels and the y-actin probe was used as an internal control for RNA recovery ( 3 ) .
Both probes were uniformly labeled with °P and the y-actin probe was made to have a specific activity that was five times less than that of the TNF-a probe .
Positions of the TNF-a and y-actin protected fragments are indicated at right .
The upper portion is a longer radiographic exposure than the lower portion .
—y~0ctin 74 Human Tumor Necrosis Factor- Gene Regulation in T and B Cell Lines stitutive or inducible TNF- mRNA was evident ( Fig .
1 , lanes 3 , 4 , 7 , and 8 ) , although a faint inducible band was detected in both cell types after a long exposure of the autoradiogram ( not shown ) .
TNF-a mRNA was constitutively expressed at low levels in P30 cells , but was not inducible by PMA ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
By contrast , in HUT78 and Raji cells , TNF- mRNA levels were highly inducible by PMA ( lanes 1 , 2 , 9 , and 10 ) ; Raji cells in addition had high levels of constitutive TNF- mRNA expression .
We conclude that constitutive and PMA induced TNF- mRNA levels vary substantially in the T cell lines tested and may represent stage-specific gene expression .
NF-KB Binding Activity Expression Does not Correlate with Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) mRNA Expression Patterns , Three sequences within the 5 regulatory region of TNF- ( x1 , « 2 , and « 3 ; Fig .
2 ) specifically bind NF-KB in nuclear extracts derived from lymphoid cells ( 15 ) .
Although these sites have previously been shown not to be required for virus and LPS induction of the human TNF- gene , it was possible that PMA induction of the gene was mediated by NF-KB .
To determine whether NF-KB binding activity could be correlated with TNF- mRNA expression , nuclear extracts were prepared from mock or PMA induced HUT78 , HPB-ALL , P30 , and Raji cells .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using the NF- « B wild type ( WT ) binding site from the murine « chain enhancer as a probe ( 25 ) .
The WT sequence bound a protein that was constitutively expressed in HUT78 ( Fig .
3 , lane 2 ) and Raji cells ( lanes 8 and 10 ) .
This binding activity was inducible in HUT78 ( lane 3 ) and HBP-ALL cells ( lane 5 ) , but as expected not further inducible in Raji cells ( lanes 8 and 9 ; see reference 16 ) .
These binding activities were efficiently competed by WT cold competitor ( lane 11 ) , but not by a mutant ( MUT ) NF-KB site ( lane 12 ) that differs at nucleotides that are crucial for NF-KB binding activity ( 25 ) .
Thus , NF-KB binding activity did not correlate with TNF-a mRNA expression ( Fig .
1 ) .
NF- « B binding activity is thought to be present or inducible in most if not all cell types ( see reference 17 for review ) .

Assay mixtures contained either no extract ( lane 1 ) or 5 ug of nuclear extract protein from unstimulated ( - ) or PMA induced ( + ) HUT78 ( lanes 2 and 3 ) , HPB-ALL ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , P30 ( lanes 6 and 7 ) , or Raji cells ( lanes 8-12 ) .
NF-KB WT and mutant ( MUT ) oligonucleotides were used as probes .
Binding assays were carried out as described in reference 20 and the NF- « B WT and HUT oligonucleotides are described in reference 25 .
The absence of NF-KB binding activity in P30 nuclear extracts treated or untreated with PMA under the conditions studied was therefore surprising ( Fig .
3 , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
It will be interesting to test whether other immature T cell lines of the same phenotype as P30 cells also display a lack of PMA-induced NF-KB binding activity .
Such cell lines however are not yet available for study .
Taken together with the mRNA expression results discussed above , we conclude that NF-KB binding activity is not necessary for constitutive expression of TNF- .
P30 cells display no such binding activity ( Fig .
3 , lane 6 ) , but express TNF-a mRNA constitutively ( Fig .
1 , lane 5 ) .
In addition , PMA inducible NF-KB binding activity is not sufficient for significant TNF-o mRNA expression .
HBP-ALL cells display PMA inducible NF- « B binding activity ( Fig .
3 , lane 5 ) , but only barely detectable TNF- mRNA induction by PMA ( Fig .
1 , lane 4 ) .
However , the T cell type in which TNF-a gene transcription was most highly inducible , HUT78 ( Fig .
1 , lanes 1 and 2 ) , displayed high levels of constitutive and inducible NF- « B binding activity ( Fig .
3 , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Similarly , Raji cells constitutively express a high level of TNF- @ mRNA that is further inducible by PMA ( Fig .
1 , lanes 9 and 10 ) .
Moreover , Raji cell nuclear extracts display high levels of constitutive NF- « B binding activity ( Fig .
3 , lanes 8 and 9 ) .
It was therefore possible that although NF- « B was not a primary mediator of TNF-a gene transcription in certain cell types , it could be in other cell types .
We were therefore interested in determining whether in HUT78 and Raji cells , k1-k3 and NF-KB played a functional role in PMA induced TNF-a gene regulation .
x1 , K2 , and x3 Are not Required for PMA Induction of Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) in HUT78 or Raji Cells .
'To determine the functional contribution of « 1 , « 2 , and « 3 to the transcriptional expression of TNF- in HUT 78 and Raji cells , 5 ' deletion TNF-a promoter CAT fusion constructs that progressively deleted k1-x3 , were transfected into these cell types ( Fig .
4 A and B ) .
Deletion of each of the sites had little effect on the induction ratio of the promoter by PMA in either cell type ( Fig .
4 A and B ) .
Moreover , the -80 TNF-a CAT fusion , in which all three of the NF- « B binding sites have been deleted , is still inducible by PMA in both cell types ( Fig .
4 A and B , lanes 9-12 ) .
Similarly , this -80 TNF-construct was inducible in Jurkat cells , which also display NF-KB binding activity ( data not shown ) .
We conclude that the NF- « B binding sites from the TNF-a promoter , « 1-3 , are not required for PMA induction of human TNF- gene transcription .

Arrows indicate the direction of the binding site relative to the direction of transcription .
Cells were transfected and mock or PMA induced and CAT assays were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section .
Although « 1-3 are not required for PMA induction of TNF-a gene transcription , they and other TNF-a promoter sequences have transcriptional activities that vary with cell type .
For example , maximal levels of constitutive and induced CAT activity are observed when -199 nt relative to the TNF-a mRNA cap site are present in HUT78 cells ( Fig .
4 A , lanes 5-8 ) .
Similarly , maximal levels of induced CAT activity are observed when -199 nt of TNF- 5¢ sequence are present in Raji cells ( Fig .
4 B , lane 8 ) .
However , maximal constitutive levels in Raji cells require the sequences between -242 and -199 that contain « 2 ( Fig .
4 B , lanes 5-8 ) .
Of interest , in HUT78 cells , the largest drop in CAT levels is observed when the sequences between -199 and -118 are deleted ( Fig .
4 A , lanes 7-10 ) .
Deletion of these sequences has a smaller effect in Raji cells ( Fig .
4 B , lanes 7-10 ) .
Another slight drop in induced CAT levels occurs in both HUT78 and Raji cells when the sequences containing K3 are deleted , but the -80 TNF- CAT fusion , is still highly inducible by PMA in both cell types ( Fig .
4 A and B , lanes 9-12 ) .
Of note , three other putative NF- « B binding sites are located between -1045 and -608 nt relative to the TNF- cap site .
When a 1045 TNF-a CAT construct was compared to a -608 TNF-a CAT construct in the presence or absence of PMA , little difference in constitutive or induced CAT activities could be discerned ( data not shown ) .
Thus , PMA induction of TNF-a gene transcription , like virus and LPS induction , is not primarily mediated through NF-KB .
Multimers of « 1 , £2 , « 3 and PRDIH Confer Inducibility on the Heterologous B-globin Promoter in Raji but not in HUT78 Cells .
To determine whether multimers of x1 , « 2 , and « 3 were capable of acting like other PMA inducible NF- « B binding sites in vivo ( see reference 17 for review ) , constructs containing multimers of these sequences upstream from a -128 -globin promoter fused to the CAT reporter gene were transfected into Raji and HUT78 cells ( Fig .
5 A and B ) .
Surprisingly , multimers of x1 , « 2 , and « 3 acted as PMA inducible elements when tested in Raji cells but not in HUT78 cells ( Fig .
5 A and B , lanes 1-8 ) .
Cell type specific activity of these multimers had previously been reported ( 15 ) .
They increased basal transcription of the -128 -globin promoter in each case in mouse fibroblast L cells but had no effect when tested in mouse monocyte P388D1 cells .
Multimers of « 1 , 2 , and x3 were not capable of conferring virus or LPS inducibility on the -128 -globin promoter in either L or P388D1 cells ( 15 ) .
PRDII is a critical element involved in the virus induction of the IFN-8 gene that has been shown to specifically bind to NF-kB and to mediate virus ( 26-28 ) and LPS induction ( 15 ) .
When four copies of PRDII are fused to either the -128 B- or -41 -globin promoter , basal and PMA induced CAT activity is greatly increased in Raji cells ( Fig .
5 A , lanes 9 , 10 , 13 and 14 ) .
In HUT78 cells by contrast , although four copies of PRDII did greatly increase constitutive CAT levels , they did not confer PMA inducibility on either the -128 or -41 B-globin promoter ( lanes 9-14 ) .
Thus , the in vivo functional role of NF-KB elements in constitutive and PMA induced transcriptional expression is cell type specific .

Multimers of x1 , x2 , and x3 Do not Increase Transcription when Fused to a Truncated Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) Promoter .
By contrast to the ~128 -globin promoter , The truncated -61 TNF-a promoter is highly inducible by PMA in Raji cells ( Fig .
5 A and Fig .
6 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
In the context of the -61 TNF-a promoter however , multimers of « 1- « 3 had no effect on either constitutive or induced transcription ( Fig .
6 , lanes 1-8 ) .
This result is consistent with the deletion data presented above ; deletion of each of the sites , « 1-x3 , had little effect on the gene 's inducibility by PMA ( Fig .
4 B ) .
Similarly , multimers of « 1-3 fused to the -61 TNF-a promoter also did not augment transcription in HUT 78 cells ( data not shown ) .
Promoter context has previously been shown to be an important variable in the function of the multimers x1-K3 .
In P388D1 cells for example , multimers of x2 augmented basal transcription of the -61 TNF-a promoter but not of the -128 B-globin promoter ( 15 ) .
Similarly , the influence of sequence context on the ability of NF- « B binding sites 77 Goldfeld et al .

to act as inducible transcriptional activators has also been demonstrated .
An NF- « B binding site required for PMA induction of IL-2R-a « chain gene does not activate transcription from a heterologous promoter , and sequences immediately adjacent to this site are critical for the gene 's induction by PMA ( 29 ) .
We conclude that the in vivo function of the NF- « B binding sites « 1-K3 is dependent on the cell type and sequence context in which they are studied .
- 52 nt 5 `` to the Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) mRNA Cap Site Are Sufficient for PMA Induction in Raji and HUT78 Cells To determine whether the minimal sequence requirements for PMA induction of TNF-a « are identical to those required for virus or LPS induction of the gene , a -52 TNF-promoter CAT fusion construct was transfected into HUT 78 and Raji cells ( Fig .
7 A and B ) .
This -52 construct was transfected into HUT78 and Raji cells ( Fig .
7 A and B , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Deletion of the sequences between ~80 and -52 nt caused a decrease in both constitutive and PMA induced CAT levels in both cell types ( Fig .
7 A and B , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
However , the decrease in induction ratio when these sequences were deleted was greater in Raji than in HUT78 cells ( Fig .
7 A and B , lanes 3-6 ) .
By contrast , the -52 TNF-a construct was not inducible by virus or LPS when studied in L and P388D1 cells .
Moreover , the minimal sequence requirements for virus induction of TNF-a gene transcription are cell type specific and differ in L cells where -61 nt are required and in P388D1 cells where ~-118 nt 5 to the TNF- mRNA cap site are required .
LPS induction of the gene in P388D1 cells also requires -118 nt 5 `` to the TNF-a mRNA cap site .
Deletion of the sequences between -61 and -52 nt abolished virus inducibility in L cells and decreased the constitutive expression of the gene in P388D1 cells ( 15 ) .
We conclude that the minimal sequences RAJ !

Cells were transfected and either mock ( ~ ) or PMA ( + ) induced as described above .
required for PMA induction of the human TNF-cx gene differ from those required for virus and LPS induction of the gene and therefore these processes are mediated through different promoter sequences and probably through different transcription factors .
Discussion Transient transfection of a 5 `` promoter deletion series of the human TNF-a gene has identified sequences necessary for maximal constitutive and PMA induced expression of the gene in a human B and T lymphocyte cell line .
Although there are three sequences in the upstream flanking sequences of the human TNF-a gene that can specifically bind the transcription factor NF-KB in lymphoid nuclear extracts ( 15 ) , these sequences are not required for PMA induction of the gene .
Moreover , PMA inducibility of TNF-a mRNA is not correlated with NF-KB binding activities in various T and B cell lines .
Taken together with results that demonstrate that x1-K3 are not required for virus and LPS induction , we conclude that TNF-a gene regulation is not primarily mediated by NF-KB .
Thus , unlike other genes that are inducible by PMA , virus , or LPS ( reviewed in reference 17 , 30 , and 31 ) that contain NF-KB binding sites , induction of human TNF- gene transcription is not accomplished through these sites .
The human TNF- gene 5 ' flanking sequences contain six regulatory regions that span the sequences from -600 to +89 nt relative to the mRNA transcription start site ( Fig .
8 ) .
Region I spans the sequences between -52 and +89 and is sufficient for PMA induction of the gene in both Raji and HUT78 cells ( Fig .

cent of purine boxes active in IL-2 gene transcription ( 32 ) and a region at ~24 nt that shares some similarity with the multi-response element , a site involved in the phorbol ester , II-1 , TNF- , and forskolin induction of the IL-6 gene promoter ( 33 ) .
Region II includes the sequences between ~61 and -52 and are required together with Region I to mediate virus induction of the gene in L cells ( 15 ) .
A putative SpI binding site at -54 nt overlaps Regions I and II ( Fig .
8 ) .
Region III includes the sequences between -80 and -61 .
Deletion of Regions II and III together results in a decrease in constitutive and PMA induced promoter activity ( Fig .
7 A and B ) .
Deletion of these regions also results in a decrease in constitutive activity in P388D1 and L cells and the loss of virus inducibility in L cells ( 15 ) .
Region IV includes the sequences between -118 and -80 nt and contains the « 3 site .
Its deletion results in a slight decrease of PMA induced activity in both Raji and HUT78 cells with little effect on the induction ratio ( Fig .
4 A and B ) .
When studied in L cells , its deletion causes an approximately threefold decrease in virus induced mRNA levels , whereas in P388D1 cells there was a slight increase in constitutive activity in P388D1 cells , and LPS or virus induction of the gene could no longer be detected ( 15 ) .
Region V includes the sequences between -199 and -118 nt and its deletion results in an approximately two-fold decrease in both constitutive and PMA induced CAT activity in HUT78 cells ( Fig .
4 ) , but has negligible effect in Raji cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
In both L and P388D1 cells , deletion of Region V results in an approximately three- to five-fold decrease in constitutive and virus and LPS induced activity ( 15 ) .
A second putative Sp1 binding site occurs in Region V at -160 nt ( Fig .
8 ) .
Neither this site or the Sp1 site at -54 nt are necessary to detect induction of the TNF-a promoter by PMA , they may however contribute to levels of transcription .
Region VI includes the sequences between -600 and -199 and contains « 1 and « 2 .
Sequences included in Region VI contribute to levels of constitutive activity in Raji cells ( Fig .
4 B ) , L and 78 Human Tumor Necrosis Factor- Gene Regulation in T and B Cell Lines P388D1 cells ( 15 ) , and to PMA induced levels in HUT78 ( Fig .
4 A ) and virus and LPS induced levels in P388D1 cells ( 15 ) .
We conclude that Regions IV ( -199 to +89 nt relative to the TNF- mRNA cap site ) are sufficient for maximal induction ratio of TNF-a gene transcription resulting from PMA , virus , or LPS treatment in the various cell types tested .
However , the minimal sequence requirements for induction of the gene by PMA , virus , and LPS differ .
We were unable to compare the sequences necessary for virus and LPS induction of TNF-a to those required for PMA induction in HUT78 and Raji cells because we could not detect induction of the promoter CAT constructs by virus or LPS in these cell types ( data not shown ) .
Previous studies have delineated sequences involved in PMA induction of the human TNF-a gene in other cell types ( 34 , 35 ) .
In one of the studies , a 185 nt region spanning sequences from -295 to -110 nt was found to be required for PMA induction of the gene and a -101 TNF- promoter CAT fusion was found not to be PMA inducible in K562 cells ( 34 ) .
This is in contrast to our findings and to those of another study in which the gene was analyzed in U937 cells ( 35 ) .
In the latter study , PMA induction of TNF- was localized to a region between -95 and -36 nt upstream of the transcription start site ( 35 ) .
These differences suggest that sequence requirements for PMA induction of TNF- may be cell type specific .
We note that the sequence requirements for virus induction of TNF-a gene transcription are cell type specific ( 15 ) .
This may reflect cell type specific differences in the amounts or types of transcription factors that interact with the promoter in the different cell types .
Surprisingly , multimers of « 1- « 3 , and PRDII , when fused to a heterologous promoter , can act as PMA inducible transcriptional activators in a B cell ( Raji ) but not a T cell line ( HUT78 ) and therefore are active in a cell type specific manner .
However « 1-K3 , when fused to a truncated TNF-a promoter , do not augment basal or PMA induced transcription in either cell type .
Possibly , proteins that bind to sequences downstream of -61 nt in the TNF-a promoter and that are involved in PMA induction interfere with the binding of NF- « B to « 1-K3 .
In this way these sequences and the transcription factors that interact with them could interfere with the ability of k1-K3 to act as PMA inducible « B enhancer elements .
These observations emphasize the importance of sequence context and cell type in the determination of promoter element function .
It is also important to note that different genes may be activated by common regulatory elements and factors , but these components that are necessary may not be sufficient to activate transcription .
For example , multiple copies of the PRDII element from the IFN-B @ promoter are activated by virus ( 21 ) , LPS ( 15 ) , and PMA ( Fig .
5 A ) , presumably achieved at least in part through interactions with NF-KB ( 15 , 26-28 ) .
However , the intact IFN- promoter which only contains one copy of PRDII , responds to virus ( 21 ) , but not to LPS ( 15 ) or PMA ( 3 ) .
The lack of LPS and PMA induction of the intact gene is probably due to the requirement of synergistic interactions between PRDII and another promoter element and/or the involvement and release of negative control .
Thus , the specificity of transcriptional activation of inducible genes in particular cell types is probably achieved by a unique combination of regulatory sequences and a corresponding unique set of binding activities that are activated by a particular inducer .
TNF-a activates three « B binding proteins in primary T cells ( 11 ) , and acts via « B sequences to induce the expression of the IL-2R- « , IL-2 , and IL-6 genes ( 11 , 29 , 30 ) .
TNF- @ has also been reported to autoinduce its own transcription in HL-60 cells ( 36 ) ; we were however unable to detect any effect of exogenously added TNF-a protein on TNF- « gene expression in the B and T cell lines studied here ( data not shown ) .
TNF-a also stimulates HIV-1 expression from latently infected cell lines either by direct activation of TNF-responsive sequences within the viral genome ( 8 ) or via other mediators such as IL-6 ( 37 ) , a potent B cell growth factor .
Thus , TNF-a may be an important mediator of the poly-clonal B cell expansion associated with AIDS and activation of HIV expression associated with the progression of dis-ease .
The understanding of TNF-a gene regulation and the role of TNF-a in the activation and differentiation of lymphocytes should therefore enhance our knowledge of both the mechanisms of HIV pathogenicity and of inducible gene expression .
