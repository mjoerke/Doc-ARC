We show that human B cells constitutively express the translesion pol & , which effectively extends DNA past mismatched bases ( mispair extender ) , and pol n , which bypasses DNA lesions in an error-free fashion .
Upon B cell receptor ( BCR ) engagement and coculture with activated CD4* T cells , these lymphocytes upregulated pol £ , downregulated pol 1 , and mu tated the Ig and be/-6 genes .
Inhibition of the pol £ REV3 catalytic subunit by specific phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides impaired Ig and be/-6 hypermutation and UV damage-induced DNA mutagenesis , without affecting cell cycle or viability .
Thus , pol & plays a critical role in Ig and be/-6 hypermutation , perhaps facilitated by the downregulation of pol .
Introduction Somatic hypermutation underlies the affinity maturation of the antibody response ( McKean et al .
, 1984 ; Ueki et al .
, 1990 ; Ikematsu et al .
, 1993 ; Chang and Casali , 1994 ; Ikematsu et al .
, 1998 ; Neuberger et al .
, 1998 ) .
It targets both the Ig and the be/-6 loci and introduces single base substitutions , with rare deletions or insertions ( Pasqualuceci et al .
, 1998 ; Shen et al .
, 1998 ; Zan et al .
, 1999 , 2000a ) .
Somatic Ig and be/-6 point mutations accumulate at a rate of 107 to 10~* per base per cell generation and extend 1.5-2.0 kb downstream of the transcription initiation site , with preference for certain hot spots ( Peters and Storb , 1996 ; Fukita et al .
, 1998 ; Neuberger et al .
, 1998 ; Shen et al .
, 1998 ; Storb et al .
, 1998a ; Zan et al .
, 1999 , 2000a ) .
They favor transitions over transversions and display strand polarity , as inferred from the A over T bias in murine Ig gene V sequences ( Smith et al .
, 1996 ; 8 Correspondence : peasali @ med.cornell.edu .

, 1998 ; Storb et al .
, 1998a ) and G over C bias in human Ig V ( D ) J and be/-6 sequences ( Chang and Casali , 1994 ; Zan et al .
, 1999 , 20002 ) .
The mechanism that underlies somatic hypermutation remains speculative , but DNA breaks have been identified in Ig V ( D ) J DNA regions of hypermutating B cells , suggesting a role of these lesions in hypermutation ( Sale and Neuberger , 1998 ; Bross et al .
, 2000 ; Papavasiliou and Schatz , 2000 ) .
Mutations would be introduced as mismatched nucleotides by a DNA polymerase while repairing a single-strand DNA gap ( Bertocci et al .
, 1998 ; Diaz and Flajnik , 1998 ; Storb et al .
, 1998b ; Zan et al .
, 2000b ) or double-strand DNA breaks ( DSBs ) through homologous recombination , possibly in concert with another polymerase ( s ) , with low processivity and error prone ( Papavasiliou and Schatz , 2000 ; Poltoratsky et al .
, 2000 ) .
After their introduction , the mutations would be `` fixed `` by the cellular mismatch repair complex and passed on to the progeny B cells ( Rada et al .
, 1998 ; Shannon and Weigert , 1998 ) .
Knowledge of DNA synthesis and repair in eukaryotes has increased considerably , leading to the identification of a dozen DNA polymerases .
Pol a , 8 , and & are involved mainly in DNA replication and are expressed prevalently in the S phase of the cell cycle ( Burgers , 1998 ) .
Pol y specifically replicates mitochondrial DNA ( Weissbach , 1979 ) , and pol 6 is restricted to DNA interstrand crosslink repair ( Johnson et al .
, 2000a ) .
Because of their specialized function , these DNA polymerases are unlikely to be involved in the hypermutation process .
Pol B is essential for base excision repair and is error prone ( Prasad et al .
, 1996 ; Sobol et al .
, 1996 ) but is not involved in hypermutation , as immune-incompetent mice reconstituted with pol B-deficient fetal liver cells mutate their Ig genes normally upon antigenic challenge ( Esposito et al .
, 2000b ) .
Both pol & and pol n ( Rad30A ) are efficient translesion polymerases ( i.e .
, they carry out lesion bypass DNA synthesis ) and could be involved in hypermutation .
Pol { is responsible for most damage-induced and spontaneous DNA mutagenesis ( mutagenic DNA repair ) ( Morrison et al .
, 1989 ; Lawrence and Hinkle , 1996 ; Nelson et al .
, 1996 ; Holbeck and Strathern , 1997 ; Gibbs et al .
, 1998 , 2000 ; Lin et al .
, 1999 ; Murakumo et al .
, 2000 ) , and pol 1 is the defective polymerase in patients with the variant form of Xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP-V ) ( Johnson et al .
, 1999b ; Masutani et al .
, 1999b ) .
In spite of its highly distributive nature and intrinsic lack of proofreading capacity , pol 1 bypasses UV - and chemical-induced lesions by inserting deoxynucleotides mostly in an error-free fashion in yeast , mouse , and human cells , as it favors the intervention of exogenous 3 `` - 5 `` exonucleases ( Johnson et al .
, 19992 , 1999 , 2000c ; Washington et al .
, 1999 ; Masutani et al .
, 1999a ; Haracska et al .
, 2000 ; Yamada et al .
, 2000 ) .
As we ( Diaz and Flajnik , 1998 ; Zan et al .
, 2000b ) and others ( Papavasiliou and Schatz , 2000 ; Poltoratsky et al .
, 2000 ) have suggested , the modalities of Ig and be/-6 somatic mutations seem to best reflect the functional features of pol & ( Papavasiliou and Schatz , 2000 ; Poltoratsky et al .
, 2000 ) .
This polymerase effectively extends DNA past a lesion ( mispair extender ) with relative high fidelity , possibly after the insertion of one or two mismatched nucleotides by a low processivity , error-prone polymerase ( mispair inserter ) , such as the recently identified pol 1 ( Rad30B ) ( Tissier et al .
, 2000 ) , pol x ( Ohashi et al .
, 2000 ) , pol A ( Aoufouchi et al .
, 2000 ; Garcia-Diaz et al .
, 2000 ) , or , perhaps , pol u ( Aoufouchi Immunity .

Disruption of the pol { REV3 gene in mice results in early embryonic lethality ( Bemark et al .
, 2000 ; Esposito et al .
, 20002 ) .
However , human fibroblasts in which REV3 gene expression is inhibited by an antisense REV3 fragment display impaired damage-induced mutagenesis but normal growth ( Gibbs et al .
, 1998 ) .
We therefore addressed the role of pol & in hypermutation using human B cells in vitro .
In this study , we show that pol & plays a critical role in hypermutation , as indicated by the significant reduction of somatic Ig and be/-6 hypermutation in B cells in which pol & mRNA transcripts were inhibited by specific oligonucleotides .
We also show that pol & is upregulated by B cell receptor ( BCR ) engagement , which simultaneously downregulates pol 1 , thereby making pol £ mispair extender activity abundantly available to possibly mutate Ig and bei-6 DNA .
Pol € Is Upregulated and pol n Is Downregulated in Mutating Human B Cells Ig V ( D ) J and be/-6 hypermutation occurs in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs , such as tonsils and lymph nodes , during the transition from IgD*CD38~ naive B cell to IgD*CD38* early centroblast and IgD-CD38* full-blown centroblast , with some IgD*CD38* B cells displaying an uncommonly high frequency of somatic mutations , possibly as a result of the sequestration of this subpopulation in the germinal center environment ( Pascual et al .
, 1994 ; Liu et al .
, 1996 ; Wilson et al .
, 2000 ) .
In human tonsils , highly mutated V ( D ) J and be/-6 DNA sequences are found in CD38* germinal center and CD38~ memory but not in CD38~ naive B cells ( Pascual et al .
, 1994 ; Liu et al .
, 1996 ; Pasqualucci et al .
, 1998 ; Shen et al .
, 1998 ; Wilson et al .
, 2000 ) .
To analyze the involvement of DNA polymerases in somatic hypermutation , we sorted tonsillar B lymphocytes into IgD*CD38~ ( naive B cells ) , IgD*CD38* ( early centroblasts ) , IgD-~CD38* ( germinal center centroblasts and cen trocytes ) , and IgD - CD38~ ( memory B cells ) fractions and measured the expression of DNA pol £ REV3 and pol n ( RAD3OA ) , as well as pol 1 ( RAD3OB ) , pol a , pol B , pol 8 , pol & , pol x , and pol u by RT-PCR ( Figure 1 ) .
The sizes of all amplified cDNAs were as predicted , and , in each case , the cDNA was cloned and found to contain the correct coding sequence ( data not shown ) .
Pol a , pol B , pol 8 , pol g , and the error-prone pol 1 and pol x were expressed at comparable levels in IgD*CD387 , IgD*CD38* , IgD-CD38* , and IgD-CD38~ B cells .
In contrast , the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the translesion pol { REV3 was expressed at significantly higher levels in the mutating IgD*CD38* and IgD-CD38* B cells than in the nonmutating IgD*CD38~ and IgD-CD38~ B cells ( Pascual et al .
, 1994 ; Liu et al .
, 1996 ; Shen et al .
, 1998 ; Wilson et al .
, 2000 ) .
The error-prone pol u was equally expressed in IgD*CD38~ , IgD-~CD38* , and IgD CD38 , B cells but slightly upregulated in IgD*CD38* cells .
Pol 1 , which can perform error-free translesion DNA synthesis , was expressed in IgD*CD38~ and slightly decreased in IgD - CD38~ B cells but significantly downregulated in IgD*CD38+* and IgD-~CD38* B cells .
The lack of VgDJy-C8 transcripts in IgD - CD38* and IgD - CD38~ lymphocytes confirmed the ( centroblastic and centrocytic ) germinal center and memory phenotype , respectively , of these B cells , while the comparable amounts of amplified CD79b and B-actin cDNA indicated that comparable numbers of cells were analyzed for each Immunity .

The differential expression of DNA pol { and pol 1 in the tonsillar B cell subsets was emphasized by the amplification of these polymerases in the same vessel , together with f-actin ( Figure 1 ) , and was confirmed by multiple RT-PCRs using serially diluted cDNAs ( see Supplemental Figure S1 at http : //www.immunity.com/cgi/content/full/14/5/645/DC1 ) ( data not shown ) .
These ex vivo experiments show that human tonsillar IgD*CD38* and IgD-CD38* B cells , which undergo intensive Ig hypermutation in response to antigen binding and T cell help , display a significant alteration of the expression of the translesion DNA pol & and pol n. BCR Induces Upregulation of pol C , Downregulation of pol n , and Ig VH ; DJp Hypermutation As we have shown in human IgM 'IgD* B cells , contact with activated CD4* T cells is sufficient to induce Ig class switching and germinal center-like differentiation ( Zan et al .
, 1998 ; Cerutti et al .
, 1998a , 1998b , 2000 ; Schaffer et al .
, 1999 ) , but induction of somatic hypermutation requires BCR engagement ( Zan et al .
, 1999 , 2000a ) .
We hypothesized that the pol £ and pol 1 up- and downregulation found in mutating B cells was induced by the antigen-mediated crosslinking of the BCR on these germinal center lymphocytes .
We used our human monoclonal CL-O1 B cell line to prove that BCR engagement modulates pol & and pol n levels and that this DNA polymerase modulation is associated with somatic hypermutation .
CL-01 B cells are Ig M *'IgD* and , upon engagement of BCR and contact with activated CD4* T cells , undergo Ig class switching and effectively mutate the Ig V ( D ) J and bei-6 genes at a rate and with modalities that mimic those of B cells in vivo ( Zan et al .
, 1999 , 20002 ) .
In these B cells , BCR engagement increased the expression of the pol { REV3 catalytic subunit while virtually ablating pol 1 expression and , together with activated CD4* T cells , induced Ig VyDJy gene hypermutation ( 28 nucleotide changes in 112.5 kb analyzed ) ( Figure 2 ) .
No alteration in the expression of pol & and pol 1 and no hypermutation occurred in similar B cells cultured with activated CD4* T cells without BCR engagement ( two changes in 94 kb ) or cultured with nil , with ( two changes in 75 kb ) or without ( one change in 56 kb ) reaction with anti-BCR Ab .
Consistent with our previous findings ( Zan et al .
, 1999 , 20002 , 2000b ) , the B cells cultured with activated CD4* T cells without BCR engagement underwent Ig class switching and germinal center phenotypic differentiation ( data not shown ) .
The specificity of the reciprocal modulation of DNA pol & and pol n was further emphasized by the relatively constant levels of pol 1 , pol a , pol B , pol 8 , pol g , and pol u in B cells reacted or not reacted with anti-BCR Ab and cultured with or without activated CD4* T cells , as well as by further analysis involving multiple RT-PCRs using serially diluted cDNAs ( data not shown ) .
These in vitro experiments show that BCR engagement effectively modulates pol { and pol 1 , expression and induces Ig hypermutation in a fashion that is consistent with the findings in ex vivo tonsillar B cells .
BCR-Induced pol C and pol n Regulation Is Dose and Time Dependent To assess the specificity of the BCR-induced modulation of DNA polymerase expression , we treated human CL-O01 IgM *IgD* B cells with increasing amounts of anti-BCR Ab and measured by RT-PCR the levels of pol & , pol 1 , pol i , pol a , pol 8 , pol s , pol k , and pol u in these cells after 12 hr of culture ( Figure 3 ) .
Consistent with the results of the ex vivo and in vitro experiments ( Figures 1 and 2 ) , these DNA polymerases were all constitutively expressed in the B cells ( Figures 3A and 3B ) .
Pol { REV3 was upregulated in a dose Immunity .

Page 5 dependent fashion by BCR engagement , which induced a concomitant downregulation of pol 1 but no significant changes in pol 1 , pol a , pol 8 , pol s , pol x , and pol u .
The reciprocal modulation of pol & and pol 1 , began as early as 1 hr after BCR engagement , peaked within 9-24 hr , and lasted as long as 48 hr after a single treatment of B cells with anti-BCR Ab ( Figure 3C ) .
It was reproduced in freshly isolated normal human IgM IgD* B cells ( Figure 3D ) and confirmed by multiple RT-PCRs using serially diluted cDNAs ( Supplemental Figure S1 and data not shown ) .
It was not due to lymphocyte proliferation or differentiation , as indicated by the demonstration that CD154 or activated CD4* T cells , which provide strong B cell proliferation and differentiation stimuli , did not influence the expression of pol E , pol 1 , pol i , pol a , pol 8 , pol s , pol x , or pol u in the absence of BCR engagement ( Figure 2 and data not shown ) .
Finally , consistent with the lack of hypermutation in T cells ( Bachl and Wabl , 1995 ) , TCR complex crosslinking by an anti-CD3 Ab did not modulate the expression of pol { or pol 1 in freshly isolated normal human T cells ( Figure 3E ) .
Specific Inhibition of pol € Impairs Ig and be/-6 Somatic Hypermutation and Damage-Induced DNA Mutagenesis in Human B Cells We used specific phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to inhibit the pol & REV3 catalytic subunit in human B cells induced by activated CD4* T cells upon BCR engagement .
The oligonucleotides were introduced into CL-O1 cells , using the cationic lipid Cytofectin GSV ( Lewis et al .
, 1996 ) , which in our hands has yielded consistently more than 85 % transfection efficiency , at a final concentration of 2 uM , starting at day -1 ( a day prior to stimulation with anti-BCR Ab and activated CD4* T cells ) and every day thereafter .
Pol { REV3 catalytic subunit , pol 1 , pol i , pol a , pol B , and pol u transcripts were determined by specific RT-PCR at days 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 14 of culture ; mutated Ig VgDJy and be/-6 transcripts were analyzed after 14 days of culture , as in the experiments of Figure 2 .
REV3 transcripts were significantly reduced by the specific sense SQ1 and antisense ASO1 but not the scrambled ( SCRA ) or the antisense ASQ2 and ASO3 oligonucleotides , as early as 36 hr after the initiation of the culture , and remained such throughout day 14 ( Figure 4A and data not shown ) .
None of the oligonucleotides inhibited pol 1 , pol a , pol B , or pol u expression .
The pol { inhibition was confirmed by multiple RT-PCRs , using different numbers of cycles and serially diluted cDNAs ( Supplemental Figure S1 and data not shown ) .
An overall comparable pattern of DNA polymerase modulations was observed in B cells cultured in the absence of activated CD4* T cells and without BCR engagement ( Figure 4B ) .
The reduced pol £ expression resulted in impaired Ig VgDJy and be/-6 hypermutation .
As we have shown ( Zan et al .
, 2000a ) , be/-6 mutates in response to the same stimuli and with the same modalities as Ig V ( D ) J genes .
As determined by single-strand DNA conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis , CL-O1 cells cocultured , upon BCR engagement , with activated CD4* T cells for 14 days with daily treatment of the scrambled ( SCRA ) oligonucleotide , and Cytofectin GSV mutated as many as 12.31 % and 9.62 % of the 375 bp Ig VygDJy , and the 226 bp bei-6 Exon I cDNA segments ( Table 1 ) , yielding a frequency of mutations of 3.28 x 10~* and 4.25 x 10~* change/base , respectively ( Figure 4C ) .
This frequency was comparable to that of similarly induced CL-O1 cells treated with Cytofectin GSV alone ( nil ) , AS02 , or ASQ3 .
In contrast , CL-01 cells stimulated with anti-BCR Ab and activated CD4* T cells but treated daily with the pol £ REV3-specific S01 or AS01 Immunity .

Page 6 oligonucleotide and Cytofectin GSV mutated as few as 3.34 % and 3.14 % of the expressed Ig VgDJy and be/-6 transcripts , respectively , which corresponded to about 73 % reduction ( p < 0.001 ) in mutation frequency , as compared to CL-O1 cells treated with SCRA , ASO2 , or ASO3 or Cytofectin GSV alone .
This decrease in Ig and be/-6 mutation frequency was not due to changes in cell cycle , viability , or proliferation , as these parameters were not significantly affected by Cytofectin GSV alone and/or the different phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides throughout the culture period ( Figures 5A and 5B ) but was associated with an impairment of the B cells to copy the UV -damaged shuttle pSP189 vector DNA ( Figure 4D ) , a mutagenic function that reflects pol & Rev3 activity ( Morrison et al .
, 1989 ; Lawrence and Hinkle , 1996 ; Nelson et al .
, 1996 ; Holbeck and Strathern , 1997 ; Gibbs et al .
, 1998 , 2000 ; Lin et al .
, 1999 ; Murakumo et al .
, 2000 ) , and increased cell death by UV light ( data not shown ) .
The Residual Ig VyDJp and be/-6 Mutations Found after Inhibition of pol C Do Not Differ from Those Introduced in the Presence of pol C The residual Ig VyDJy and be/-6 mutations in the CL-01 cells induced by activated CD4* T cells upon BCR-engagement and treated with the REV3-specific oligonucleotides displayed features similar to those found in the CL-O01 cells similarly induced but treated with the SCRA oligonucleotide or Cytofectin GSV alone .
The 56 Ig and 23 be/-6 exon 1 mutated cDNA clones from the induced CL-O1 cells treated with the SCRA oligonucleotide ( Table 1 ) bore 58 and 27 independent point mutations , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
Of the total 85 point mutations , 55 ( 65 % ) were transitions , while randomly occurring point mutations would be expected to be one-third transitions and two-thirds transversions .
G nucleotides were mutated ( 49.4 % of the total point mutations ) at a frequency 68 % higher than expected by chance alone ( 29.4 % ) , after correcting for base composition , with G - > A transitions accounting for 69.0 % of the total G mutations and 52.7 % of all transitions .
The residual 26 Ig VygDJy and 16 be/-6 exon 1 mutated cDNA clones from the induced CL-O01 cells treated with the REV3-specific S01 and ASO1 oligonucleotides ( Table 1 ) bore 26 and 17 independent point mutations , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
Of the total 43 point mutations , 29 ( 67.2 % ) were transitions .
G nucleotides were mutated at a frequency ( 51.2 % of the total point mutations ) 74.2 % higher than that expected by chance alone ( 29.4 % ) , after correcting for base composition , with G - > A transitions accounting and 58.6 % for 77.3 % of the total G mutations of all transitions .
Discussion As we showed , the induction of Ig and be/-6 hypermutation ( Zan et al .
, 1999 , 2000a ) but not that of class switch DNA recombination ( Zan et al .
, 1998 ; Cerutti et al .
, 1998a , 1998b , 2000 ; Schaffer et al .
, 1999 ) requires , in addition to CD4* T cell help , BCR engagement , thereby indicating that the function of the BCR goes beyond providing the structural correlate for the selection of higher affinity mutants .
We show here that , in B cells , the expression of the translesion pol { is effectively modulated by BCR engagement and that the inhibition of this polymerase by specific oligonucleotides impairs Ig VyDJy and be/-6 hypermutation and , to a comparable extent , DNA damage-induced mutagenesis without affecting cell cycle or growth .
Thus , in human B cells , pol & is regulated by the BCR and plays a critical role in Immunity .

Page 7 somatic hypermutation , perhaps facilitated by pol n downregulation , which is also BCR dependent .
The modulation of the expression of these polymerases may be regulated not only at the transcriptional but also the posttranscriptional level .
B cells initiate somatic hypermutation upon exposure to antigen and activated CD4¢* T cells in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs .
The demonstration that BCR engagement signals in a dose-dependent fashion the upregulation of pol £ with concomitant downregula tion of pol n , while inducing Ig and be/-6 hypermutation , is highly consistent with the findings in tonsillar B cells : pol £ was upregulated and pol n downregulated in IgD*CD38+* and IgD~CD38+* B cells , which include the majority of the highly hypermutating B lymphocytes ( Pascual et al .
, 1994 ; Liu et al .
, 1996 ; Wilson et al .
, 2000 ) , but not in IgD*CD38~ naive B cells , which express unmutated Ig V ( D ) J and be/-6 genes , and in IgD CD38~ memory B cells , which express mutated Ig V ( D ) J and be/-6 genes , but in which the hypermutation process is extinct ( Figure 1 ) .
The demonstration that BCR engagement increases pol & and decreases pol 1 but does not lead to somatic hypermutation unless activated T cells are also present ( Figure 2 ) suggests that accessibility of the hypermutation machinery to the Ig and be/-6 loci is important and likely requires multiple signals .
Our experiments show that pol & , which is essential for DNA damage-induced mutagenesis ( Morrison et al .
, 1989 ; Lawrence and Hinkle , 1996 ; Nelson et al .
, 1996 ; Holbeck and Strathern , 1997 ; Gibbs et al .
, 1998 , 2000 ; Lin et al .
, 1999 ; Murakumo et al .
, 2000 ) , is also critical for the hypermutation of both the Ig and be/-6 loci in human B cells .
In spite of the lack of 3 ' - > 5 `` exonuclease activity , pol { copies with high fidelity undamaged DNA template ( Johnson et al .
, 2000b ) .
It is very inefficient in inserting deoxynucleotides opposite DNA lesions but readily extends from such nucleotides once they have been inserted .
Indeed , it extends damaged DNA efficiently , in concert with the error-prone , low processivity pol i , after the incorporation of one or two mismatched deoxynucleotides opposite DNA lesions by this polymerase ( Johnson et al .
, 2000b ) .
Pol 1 and pol & act sequentially : pol 1 as a `` mispair inserter `` and pol & as `` mispair extender . ``
The central role of pol { in damage-induced mutagenesis would be reflected in the central role of this polymerase in hypermutation .
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , pol C has been shown to be involved in the generation of most mutations associated with transcription ( Datta and Jinks-Robertson , 1995 ) and , by engaging sites near DNA breaks , to increase the frequency of base substitutions in the vicinity of breaks by at least 100-fold ( Strathern et al .
, 1995 ; Holbeck and Strathern , 1997 ) .
Both transcription and DNA breaks would be involved in the B cell somatic hypermutation process .
The meaning of the BCR-induced downregulation of pol 1 in human hypermutating B cells in vivo ( Figure 1 ) and in vitro ( Figures 2 and 4 ) is unclear .
Pol n lacks proofreading 3 `` - 5 `` exonuclease activity , but its low processivity allows for extrinsic exonucleases to proofread the mismatched nucleotides it inserts ( Bebenek et al .
, 2001 ) .
This , together with the inability of pol | to elongate a DNA chain after incorporating the incorrect nucleotide opposite a lesion , allows this polymerase to perform error-free translesion synthesis of damaged DNA ( Johnson et al .
, 1999a , 19992 , 1999b , 2000a ; Washington et al .
, 1999 ; Masutani et al .
, 2000 ; Matsuda et al .
, 2000 ) .
Our demonstration that BCR engagement upregulates pol and profoundly downregulates pol 1 , supports the speculation that the lack or scarcity of pol 1 Immunity .

Page 8 facilitates the insertion of mismatched nucleotides ( mutations ) at the site of DNA breaks by another ( error-prone ) polymerase , such as pol t or pol u , which would then lead to the extension of the mutated DNA by the mispair extender pol & .
Both pol t and pol u have been suggested to be preferentially expressed in secondary lymphoid tissues ( Aoufouchi et al .
, 2000 ; Dominguez et al .
, 2000 ; Poltoratsky et al .
, 2000 ) .
Neither was downregulated by BCR engagement in vivo ( Figure 1 ) or in vitro ( Figures 2-4 ) .
The involvement of pol & in the somatic hypermutation process was demonstrated using specific sense and antisense phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides , which effectively inhibited the expression of the REV3 gene without altering the expression of pol , pol a , pol B , pol u , or B-actin ( Figures 4A and 4B ) .
The ability of S01 and ASO1 but not ASO2 and ASO3 to actually inhibit pol & expression was highly consistent with the degree of effectiveness predicted for these oligonucleotides using the HY Bsimulator ( RNAture , Inc. ) .
Antisense oligonucleotides would disrupt gene expression by providing a substrate for RNase H upon hybridization with mRNA ( Gewirtz et al .
, 1998 ) ; sense oligonucleotides would impair gene transcription by hybridizing with double-strand DNA , within the major helix groove , to generate a triple-stranded molecule , thereby preventing duplex unwinding ( Chan and Glazer , 1997 ; Gewirtz et al .
, 1998 ; Praseuth et al .
, 1999 ; Catapano et al .
, 2000 ; Faria et al .

The impairment of UV-induced DNA mutagenesis , as assessed using the pSP189 shuttle vector ( Figure 4E ) , in the human B cells treated with the pol £ REV3 S01 and ASO1 but not the SCRA , AS02 , or the AS03 phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleodites strengthened our findings on Ig and be/-6 hypermutation .
The normal cell cycle , viability , and proliferation of the human B cells in which pol £ REV3 transcripts were inhibited by the specific oligonucleotides was evocative of the findings in human MSU-1.2-10A-42 fibroblasts , in which the expression of a high level of antisense REV3 mRNA significantly affected UV-induced mutagenesis but not cell division ( Gibbs et al .
, 1998 ) .
The residual damage-induced mutagenic activity measured in the B cells treated with S01 and ASO1 was consistent with the residual mutations detected in the Ig VygDJy and be/-6 genes of the same cells ( Figures 4C and 4D ) .
Recently , a potential RNA editing enzyme activation-induced ( cytidine ) deaminase ( AID ) has been found to play a crucial role in class switching and Ig somatic hypermutation ( Muramatsu et al .
, 2000 ; Revy et al .
, 2000 ) .
In AID-deficient mice and patients with defective AID function , Ig somatic hypermutation appears to be defective ( Muramatsu et al .
, 2000 ; Revy et al .
, 2000 ) , but the role of AID in the somatic hypermutation process in unclear and possibly indirect .
The most likely targets for AID could be any of the DNA enzymes that would be involved in somatic hypermutation , including pol & and perhaps an endonuclease that creates a single-strand nick or a double-strand cut .
Thus , pol & and AID would represent different elements with different functions in the somatic hypermutation process , which would also include , as suggested by our experiments , a role for the modulation of pol n. Whether pol 1 , overexpression affects Ig somatic hypermutation and whether AID expression is , like pol & and pol 11 , under the control of signals emanating from the BCR is currently being investigated in our laboratory .

Page 9 Experimental Procedures Lymphocytes The phenotypic and functional features of the human monoclonal IgM 'IgD* CL-O1 B cell line were reported ( Zan et al .
, 1998 , 1999 , 2000a ; Cerutti et al .
, 1998a , 1998b , 2000 ; Schaffer et al .
, 1999 ) .
To prepare sIgD* B cells , human PBMCs were depleted of T cells ( Cerutti et al .
, 1998b ) , reacted with a mouse mAb to human IgD ( Southern Biotechnology Associates , Inc. ) , and then with magnetic Microbeads conjugated with goat anti-mouse IgG ( Miltenyi Biotec , Inc. ) .
The Microbead-treated sIgD* B cells were separated using a MACS magnetic sorter ( Miltenyi Biotec , Inc. ) .
Tonsillar IgD*CD38~ , IgD*CD38* , IgD - CD38+ , and IgD~CD38~ B cells were selected upon incubation of purified IgD* B cells with MultiSort Release Reagent ( Miltenyi Biotec , Inc. ) , FITC-conjugated mouse mAb to CD38 ( PharMingen ) , and anti-FITC MicroBeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , Inc. ) , as reported ( Cerutti et al .
, 2000 ) .
The homogeneity of the separated cell fractions was assessed using a FACScalibur ( Becton Dickinson ) .
The human activated CD4* T cells used for the hypermutation induction experiments were prepared as reported ( Zan et al .
, 1999 , 20002 ) .
Human DNA pol C , pol n , pol 1 , pol a , pol B , pol & , pol e , pol x , and pol u Transcripts The level of pol & , pol 1 ( RAD30A ) , pol v ( RAD3OB ) , pol a , pol B , pol 8 , pol s , pol x , and pol u was analyzed by RT-PCR .
This was made semiquantitative by performing dilution analysis so that there was a linear relationship between the amount of cDNA used and the intensity of the PCR product .
Each PCR consisted of 25 cycles , each of 1 min denaturation at 94°C , 1 min annealing at 60°C , and 1 min extension at 72°C .
The amplifications were completed by an additional 10 min extension at 72°C .
RT-PCR using [ a- `` `` P ] dCTP consisted of 10 , 15 , and 25 cycles .
RNA was extracted from 2 x 10° B cells , using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Inc. ) .
The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized from equal amounts of total RNAs ( 4 ug ) , using the SuperScript Preamplification System ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
The different cDNAs were amplified using the same amount of first-strand cDNA template together with the following specific primers : pol { REV3 , 5 `` -GAGATTCAGATGCATTCCTGG-3 ' ( forward ) , 5-GTCTTGCTTGTAAGCCTTCAT-3 ' ( reverse ) , or 5-GTTGCTTTGAT CGACACATCCC-3 `` ' ( for2 ) , 5 `` -GAGGTTTTCAGTGCTCCTTCCAC-3 ( rev ) , 5-ATGTGGACATCCTGCTCATCCG-3 ( rev2 ) ; pol n , 5 !

In selected experiments , RT-PCR for pol £ REV3 , pol 11 , and B-actin were performed in the same vessel .
Induction of Somatic Hypermutation in Human B Cells To induce Ig hypermutation , human IgM *IgD* CL-O1 B cells ( 0.5 x 10° ) were reacted for 1 hr at 4°C with IMMUNOBEAD-conjugated rabbit Ab to human Ig m chain and rabbit Ab to human Ig ( H + L chain ) ( Irvine Scientific ) ( mixed 1:1 at 1 ug/ml ! )
( anti-BCR Ab ) , and then washed with cold PBS before being placed in culture with activated CD4* T cells .
The activated CD4* T cells were used at least 2 weeks from the last stimulation and were incubated for 6 hr with 20 ng/ml of 13-phorbol 12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) and 500 ng/m !
of ionomycin ( Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co. ) prior to coculture with B cells ( Zan et al .
, 1999 , 2000a ) .
B cells were cocultured in the presence of 2.5 x 10° irradiated and activated CD4 T cells or nil in a flat-bottom 6-well ( 5.0 ml FCS-RPMI volume ) plate .
After 7 days of culture during which fresh anti-BCR Ab was added every other day at a final concentration of 0.1 ug/ml , the lymphocytes were washed in fresh FCS-RPMI and then supplemented with freshly activated CD4* T cells .
After additional 7 days of similar treatment , the cultures were terminated .
At 12 hr , 1 day , 2 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 14 days from the initiation of the culture , the B cells were purified by positive selection with a biotinylated anti-CD19 mAb and MiniMac System Streptavidin microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , Inc. ) and used as a source of mRNA for the analysis of DNA polymerases and Ig V ( D ) J and be/-6 mutations .
Analysis of Mutated Ig VpDJp and bel-6 Transcripts The VgDJy and be/-6 transcripts were amplified by RT-PCR using the Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) ( Zan et al .
, 1999 , 2000a ) .
cDNAs were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit ( Qiagen ) and cloned into pCR-Blunt II TOPO ( Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning kit , Invitrogen ) .
Mutated VgDJy transcripts were identified by SSCP analysis and then sequenced ( Zan et al .
, 1999 , 20002 ) .
Identical somatic point mutations were counted only once , on the assumption that they were due to the same mutational events ( shared mutations ) , although some of these mutations might have arisen independently .
The expected frequency of mutations from one base to the other three was calculated by assuming randomness .
The comparisons of the observed with the expected number of mutations were performed using a contingency table ( x > test ) .
Inhibition of pol € Expression , Ig , and be/-6 Somatic Hypermutation and UV Damage-Induced Mutagenesis by Specific pol ( REV3 Oligonucleotides The specific pol & REV3 phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides were designed by RNAture , Inc. , using the proprietary HYBsimulator `` Antisense Strategy , `` and were synthesized by GenBase , Inc. S01 ( 5-GACTTATGTCGGATG-3 ' ) was identical to and ASO1 ( 5-CATCCGACATAAGTC-3 `` ) was the reverse complement of the 15 nucleotides 7301-7315 of the human pol £ REV3 mRNA sequence ( GenBank number AF157476 ) .

The phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides were introduced into CL-01 cells using Cytofectin GSV ( Glen Research Corp. ) ( Lewis et al .
, 1996 ) .
Oligodeoxynucleotides ( 50 uM ) and Cytofectin GSV ( 25 ug/ml ) were allowed to associate in 250 ul Opti-MEM media ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) for 10 min at room temperature .
The oligonucleotides/ Cytofectin GSV mixture was supplemented with FCS-RPMI to yield a total volume of 2.5 ml .
The resulting mixture was then added to 0.5 x 10° CL-O01 cells in a flat-bottom 6-well plate which was incubated for 24 hr at 37°C .
After incubation , the B cells were reacted with anti-BCR Ab and then cocultured with CD4* T cells for a cycle of 14 days , as outlined above , with the oligonucleotides/Cytofectin GSV treatment being repeated every 24 hr .
B cells were purified after 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 14 days by positive selection with a biotinylated anti-CD19 mAb and MiniMac System Streptavidin microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , Inc. ) for the the analysis of the DNA polymerases and the Ig VgDJy and be/-6 transcripts .
At the same time points , the same and similar cultures were analyzed for cell number , viability ( trypan blue exclusion ) , and cycle , using propidium iodide ( PI ) and fluorescence flow cytometry ( Noguchi , 1992 ) .
Damage-induced DNA mutagenesis was analyzed essentially as reported by Seidman ( Seidman , 1996 ) .
In brief , CL-O1 cells were treated with Cytofectin GSV only or with Cytofectin GSV and the pol £ REV3 S01 , AS01 , SCRA , ASO2 , and AS03 oligonucleotides daily for 3 days and transfected with the UV-irradiated ( 500 J/m ) pSP189 shuttle vector on day 4 .
After 2 more days of culture , the plasmid DNA was recovered , digested with Dpr I , and used to transform E. Coli MBM 7070 test strain .
The frequency of white ( mutated ) colonies was taken as measure of B cell mutagenic activity .
