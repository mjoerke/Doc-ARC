10 Selection of Optimal < kB/Rel DNA-Binding Motifs : Interaction of Both Subunits of NF- « B with DNA Is Required for Transcriptional Activation CHARLES KUNSCH , t STEVEN M. RUBEN , anp CRAIG A. ROSEN®* Department of Gene Regulation , Roche Institute of Molecular Biology , 340 Kingsland Street , Nutley , New Jersey 07110 Received 4 June 1992/Accepted 14 July 1992 Analysis of the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF- « B transcription factor complex has revealed that both proteins can interact with related DNA sequences through either homo- or heterodimer formation .
In addition , the product of the proto-oncogene c-re/ can bind to similar DNA motifs by itself or as a heterodimer with p50 or p65 .
However , these studies have used a limited number of known « B DNA motifs , and the question of the optimal DNA sequences preferred by each homodimer has not been addressed .
Using purified recombinant p50 , p65 , and c-Rel proteins , optimal DNA-binding motifs were selected from a pool of random oligonucleotides .
Alignment of the selected sequences allowed us to predict a consensus sequence for binding of the individual homodimeric Rel-related proteins , and DNA-protein binding analysis of the selected DNA sequences revealed sequence specificity of the proteins .
Contrary to previous assumptions , we observed that p65 homodimers can interact with a subset of DNA sequences not recognized by p50 homodimers .
Differential binding affinities were also obtained with p50- and c-Rel-selected sequences .
Using either a p50- or p65S-selected « B motif , which displayed differential binding with respect to the other protein , little to no binding was observed with the heterodimeric NF-sB complex .
Similarly , in transfection experiments in which the selective B binding sites were used to drive the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct , the p6S5- and p50-selected motifs were activated only in the presence of p65 and p50/65 ( a chimeric protein with the p50 DNA binding domain and p6S activation domain ) expression vectors , respectively , and neither demonstrated a significant response to stimuli that induce NF- « B activity .
These findings demonstrate that interaction of both subunits of the heterodimeric NF- « B complex with DNA is required for DNA binding and transcriptional activation and suggest that transcriptional activation mediated by the individual re/-related proteins will differ dramatically , depending on the specific « B motifs present .
Binding of the NF- « B transcription factor complex to the « B enhancer motif , originally identified in the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) « light-chain enhancer ( 48 ) , plays an essential role in the activation of many viral and cellular genes ( reviewed in references 3 , 14 , and 25 ) .
Initial results obtained with cellular NF- « B complexes suggested that the p50 subunit conferred the DNA-binding properties , whereas the p65 subunit was assumed to confer the transcriptional activation function ( 2 , 21 , 52 ) .
However , cloning and subsequent experimental manipulations of the individual NF- « B p50 ( 7 , 13 , 22 ) and p65 ( 34 , 42 ) protein subunits have furthered our understanding of NF-KB function and have provided valuable insight into the mechanism of transcriptional activation .
By using purified recombinant p50 , it has been shown that this subunit can bind specifically to kB DNA sequence motifs ( 13 , 22 ) and can elicit transcriptional activation in an in vitro transcription system ( 11 , 24 ) .
The amino acid residues conferring the DNA-binding function of p50 are localized within the N-terminal 300 amino acids of the protein ( 13 , 22 ) .
This region shares extensive homology to the amino-terminal portion of the proto-oncogene product c-Rel and the Dro-sophila maternal morphogen dorsal protein , both of which interact with xB DNA motifs ( 6 , 13 , 18 , 19 , 22 ) .
Initial studies with the isolated p65 protein failed to detect binding to kB DNA by either electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( 2 , 52 ) or UV cross-linking experiments ( 21 ) .

4412 more , methylation interference patterns of p50 homodimers or the p50/p65 NF- « B complex were identical ( 2 , 8 ) .
Consequently , it was believed that p65 did not contribute to the binding of the complex .
More recently , however , it has been shown that the p65 subunit , in addition to providing transcriptional activation functions ( 5 , 43 , 46 ) , interacts on its own with xB DNA ( 34 , 42 , 51 ) .
Similar to the situation for p50 , the DNA-binding domain of p65 is present within the N-terminal 300 amino acids of the protein ( 34 , 42 ) , and the transcriptional activation functions of p65 have been localized to the carboxy terminus of the protein ( 5 , 43 , 46 ) .
Gel retardation analysis and DNA-protein cross-linking studies have identified several proteins in addition to p50 , p65 , and c-Rel that have « B DNA-binding activity ( reviewed in reference 1 ) .
The ability of the various Rel-related proteins to recognize similar DNA sequence elements through either homo- or heterodimer formation raises intriguing possibilities relating to differential regulation of gene expression .
Selective regulation may be achieved through differential heterodimer formation between individual Rel-related family members .
For example , c-Rel has been shown to interact with NF- « B p50 ( 27 ) and p65 ( 16 ) and also repress transcriptional activation by NF- « B ( 29 ) .
Recently , another Rel-related protein , termed Rel-B ( 44 ) or I-Rel ( 41 ) , cloned from murine or human sources , respectively , was identified .
In contrast to other Rel-related proteins , Rel-B/I-Rel does not interact with DNA ( 41 , 44 ) , nor does it form homodimers ( 41 ) .
Similarly , I-Rel does not form a heterodimer with p65 ( 41 ) .
However , Vor .
12 , 1992 both Rel-B and I-Rel form heterodimers with p50 and appear to either enhance ( 44 ) or repress ( 41 ) transcriptional activation .
An alternatively spliced variant of NF- « B p65 , p6S5A ( 43 ) , has also been identified and shown to interact with p65 and repress transcriptional activation ( 33 , 43 ) .
Therefore , one level of regulation by the Rel family of proteins likely involves differential heterodimer formation among the various Rel protein members .
Perhaps another level of regulation may involve differential affinities of the various Rel family members to subtle variations in the kB DNA-binding motif .
Although slight variations in the DNA-binding affinity of p50 homodimers versus heterodimeric p50/p6S5 have been observed ( 51 , 52 ) , exclusive binding preferences for the Rel proteins for one kB motif over another have not yet been reported .
This is likely because only a select few « kB motifs have been examined for differential binding affinities to the various Rel proteins .
To determine the unbiased preferred DNA-binding sites for the p50 , p65 , and c-Rel proteins and to examine whether there are absolute DNA specificities for the various Rel protein homodimers , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification was used to amplify from a pool of random oligonucleotides those sequences bound by either p50 , p65 , or c-Rel .
We found that in addition to novel DNA motifs recognized by each of the individual proteins , subsets of sequences that selectively recognize only one or two of the individual proteins were obtained .
Most important , selected DNA motifs that bound either p50 or p65 , but not both , failed , or were significantly reduced in their ability , to recognize NF- « B ( p50/p65 ) .
When used to drive expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmid in transfection studies , these motifs responded weakly , if at all , to stimuli that induce NF- « B activity .
Therefore , our results suggest the existence of several xB motifs that have differential binding specificities for the Rel proteins , implicating a role for such motifs in selective regulation of gene expression .
In addition , our results have shown that DNA binding of both the p50 and p65 subunits of the heterodimeric complex is required for binding and transcriptional activation of NF-kB .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Binding site selection .
Methods for determining the DNA target sites for DNA-binding proteins have been previously described in detail ( 28 , 36 , 37 ) .
To identify the DNA sequences that were bound optimally by p50 , p65 , and c-Rel homodimers , bacterially expressed proteins were incubated at limiting concentrations in a standard binding reaction mixture ( see below ) containing *°P-labeled random oligonucleotides ( synthesized with a mixture of all four phosphora-midites at each random position ) flanked on either side by a known sequence to facilitate PCR amplification and subsequent cloning of the recovered DNA .
The DNA sequence of the random oligonucleotide was TCCGTGAC ( N , , , CGAAGCTITTATCGATCCGAGCG-3 ' .
The oligonucleotide was purified on an OPC cartridge ( Ap-plied Biosystems , Inc. ) and labeled with °°P-labeled deoxy-nucleoside triphosphates ( dNTPs ) by annealing a complementary oligonucleotide ( 5 @ -CGCTCGGATCGATAAGCT TCG-3 ' ) and extension of the annealed primer as described below .
To isolate the bound DNA , protein-DNA complexes were separated from free oligonucleotide by electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described below .
Following autoradio-graphic exposure of the wet gel for 2 h , the DNA-protein SELECTION OF OPTIMAL < B/REL DNA-BINDING MOTIFS 4413 complex was excised from the gel and eluted from the acrylamide by incubation with 150 pl of Tris-EDTA overnight at 4°C or by electroelution in 0.5 % Tris-borate-EDTA .
Five microliters of the eluted DNA was amplified by PCR with primers that were complementary to the nonrandom flanking sequence .
Amplification was for 25 cycles on a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler ; each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94°C ( 1 min ) , annealing at 55°C ( 1.5 min ) , and extension at 72°C ( 2 min ) .
Reaction products were analyzed on a 3 % agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide .
The PCR products were subsequently extracted with phenol-chloroform , ethanol precipitated , and suspended in 50 wl of Tris-EDTA .
Three additional cycles of DNA-protein binding , elution , and PCR amplification were performed .
For each cycle , 1 wl of PCR product from the previous amplification was incubated with the protein and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , using °°P-labeled random oligonucleotides as a marker for the protein-DNA complex .
After the fourth cycle , the PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pBluescript ( Stratagene ) .
Insert-containing clones were isolated and subjected to dideoxy sequencing ( 45 ) .
Screening of selected DNA sequences for binding to p50 , p65 , and c-Rel .
To assess the ability of the various cloned DNA inserts to bind to homodimeric p50 , p65 , and c-Rel , radiolabeled probes of insert-containing clones were pre-gared and assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
°P-labeled DNA probes corresponding to each insert were prepared by PCR .
One microliter of a bacterial suspension or purified plasmid DNA from each clone was used in a standard PCR reaction containing [ °°P ] dCTP .
The primers spanned across each cloning site of the insert DNA and into the Bluescript vector .
One microliter of the PCR reaction was used in a standard binding reaction , and the resultant protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 4 % native polyacrylamide gels .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
Bacterially expressed p50 , p65 , and c-Rel were prepared and purified as previously described ( 43 ) .
Briefly , cDNA encoding amino acid residues corresponding to the DNA-binding domain of each protein was fused in frame with a six-histidine moiety under control of a bacteriophage T5 promoter regulated by a lac operon ( 12 ) .
Following induction of mid-logarithmic-phase cultures of Escherichia coli with 1 mM ranoside ( IPTG ) , the cells were lysed in 6 M guanidine-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) , and recombinant protein was purified by passing the cleared lysate over a nickel chelate affinity resin ( 43 ) .
Purified protein was renatured slowly by dialysis against a decreasing guanidine-HCl gradient .
Human c-Rel protein was not purified and was used in binding assays as a crude F. coli lysate .
In vitro-translated proteins were prepared as previously described ( 43 ) by standard in vitro transcription and translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Promega ) .
Binding reactions were performed as previously described ( 43 ) , with the addition of 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , and 1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml .
Binding reactions were performed in a 20-pl volume containing purified bacterial protein ( ~20 ng ) or translation lysate ( 2 pl ) and *P -labeled probe ( ~0.5 ng ; 50,000 cpm ) .
Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels ( 4 % ) were electrophoresed at 4°C in 0.5 % Tris-borate-EDTA .
Oligonucleotides and preparation of radiolabeled probes .
All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosys-tems DNA synthesizer .
The nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotides used are as follows : 4414 KUNSCH ET AL .

Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by column chro-matography over a Sephadex G-25 column ( 5'- > 3 ' , Inc. ) .
Cell culture and transfection .
Jurkat T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum and 50 g of gentamicin per mi .
For transient transfection assays , 5 x 10° to 10 x 10° cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran procedure ( 38 ) ; 1 ug of reporter plasmid and 2 to 5 ug of the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) expression vectors were used for each transfection .
Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection , and CAT assays were performed as described previously ( 15 ) .
For some samples , cells were treated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ; 50 ng/ml ) 12 h prior to cell harvest .
Plasmid constructions .
The eukaryotic expression vectors CMV-p50 , CMV-p50/65 , and CMV-p65 contain the respective cDNAs cloned between a CMV promoter B-globin intron and simian virus 40 poly ( A ) signal and were constructed as previously described ( 43 ) .
CMV-p50/65 is a chimeric gene containing the sequences that encode amino acids 1 to 370 of p50 and 309 to 550 of p65 .
The CMV -rel/p65 expression vector is a chimeric gene containing the sequences that encode amino acids 1 to 299 of human c-Rel and 309 to 550 of p65 .
Plasmids p ( HIVkB ) , CAT , p ( Mut « B ) , CAT , p ( 65-2 « B ) , CAT , and p ( 50-14xkB ) , CAT were constructed by standard PCR cloning techniques ( 17 ) ; they contain four tandem copies of the various kB DNA sequences cloned upstream of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and fused to the coding region of the bacterial CAT gene .
The primers for PCR contain the sequence 55-CGGGCTCGAGGGATCC ( « B ) AGA ( kB ) TCAA ( kB ) ACT ( kB ) GGAGGCGTGGCC TGGGCGGG-3 ' , where the sequences of the various kB motifs are as follows : HIVxB , GGGGACTTTCC ; Mut « B , GCTCAATCTCC ; 65-2 « B , CCGGAAATTCC ; and 50-14 « B , GGGGCCTCCCC .
These primers were used individually in conjunction with a primer at the 3 ' end of the CAT gene ( 5 ' : -GGGCCCTCTAGATTACGCCCCGCCCTG-3 ' ) and the HIV-1 LTR CAT reporter plasmid ( pU3R-III ) ( 40 ) as the template .
The resultant PCR products were digested with Xhol and EcoRI ( which cuts at a single site in the CAT gene ) and cloned into the vector pBLCATPA ( kindly provided by P. Dillon ) containing the Simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal cloned downstream of the CAT gene .
All plasmids constructions were confirmed by standard dideoxy sequencing .
RESULTS Selection of DNA sequence elements that recognize p50 , p65 , or c-Rel homodimers .

After the final PCR amplification , the recovered DNA was subcloned and indi- 4416 KUNSCH ET AL .
vidual clones were analyzed for their ability to bind to the respective proteins .
As shown in panels A of Fig .
1 to 3 , all of the selected sequences were able to bind to the respective proteins from which they were selected .
Panels B of Fig .
1 to 3 show the DNA sequences of the various cloned inserts obtained through selection with each protein .
The sequences were aligned to conform to a 10 nucleotide ( nt ) consensus and are shown within the context of the 16 random nt and the nonrandom flanking sequences .
The alignments are based only on a predicted consensus for a 10-nt « B motif .
In some instances , the motif can be extended to 11 nt , shifted by 1 nt in either direction , or read from the opposite strand and still conform to a kB consensus ( 1 ) .
Therefore , the predicted alignments may represent only one of perhaps multiple possible binding sites ; a more detailed analysis of the individual motifs is necessary to precisely identify the contribution of each nucleotide in the binding of the various proteins .
Of the 18 sequences obtained from the clones that were selected for binding to p50 ( Fig .
1 ) , 8 contained the identical sequence , GGGGATTCCC , which is found in the murine major histocompatibility complex class I gene ( H-2K `` ) ( 4 ) .
This sequence has also been shown to preferentially bind to the HZ2TFI/KBF1 factor ( now identified as the p50 subunit of NF- « B [ 4 , 20 , 22 ] ) present in nuclear extracts of B cells and induced T cells .
Also , the « B DNA sequence ( GGGAAGC CCC ) in clone 50-8 is found in the -2K `` gene ( 20 ) .
Sequences corresponding to kB motifs found in other genes include a motif present in the promoter of the serum amyloid A precursor ( 10 ) , the Ig x light-chain enhancer ( 48 ) and HIV-1 LTR ( 32 ) ( clone 50-13 ) , and the promoter of tumor necrosis factor B ( 1 ) ( clone 50-8 ) .
Five clones contained the perfectly palindromic sequence GGGGATCCCC , the sequence of which has yet to be identified with any known gene .
Other , as yet undefined sequences are contained in clones 50-2 , 50-6 , and 50-14 .
On the basis of the alignment of the p50-selected clones , the consensus sequence GGGGA TYCCC ( where Y is pyrimidine ) can be assigned .
This consensus sequence agrees with a previous observation indicating that p50 prefers a more symmetric binding motif in comparison with p65 ( 51 ) .
Analysis of the p65-selected DNA sequences , although demonstrating sequence variation , can be aligned to conform to the consensus GGGRNTTTCC ( where R is purine and N is any nucleotide ) ( Fig .
2B ) .
Of the 18 sequences shown , some represent known « B motifs identified in regulatory elements of genes , including the angiotensinogen ( 39 ) ( clone 65-4 ) , B ; , -microglobulin ( 20 ) ( clone 65-6 ) , invariant chain Ii ( 35 ) ( clones 65-7 , 65-12 , and 65-13 ) , H-2K `` ( clone 65-14 ) , HIV-1 LTR ( clone 65-15 ) , interleukin-8 ( 30 ) ( clones 65-9 and 65-10 ) , and c-myc ( 9 ) ( clone 65-17 ) genes .
Novel binding sequences which have yet to be associated with any genes are found in clones 65-1 , -2 , -3 , -5 , -8 , -11 , -14 , and -18 .
Analysis of the c-Rel-selected sequences showed the highest degree of variation .
As observed from the sequence alignment in Fig .
3B , it appears that the 3 ' half-site is the most conserved , similar to what has been observed for the p6S5-selected sequences .
This level of conservation may be predicted from the high degree of relatedness of c-Rel to p65 and the observation that p65 prefers the 3 ' half-site for binding ( 51 ) .
Of the c-Rel-selected sequences , clone rel-2 corresponds to the motif found in the invariant chain Ii ( 35 ) , and clone rel-14 corresponds to the motif found in the vimentin enhancer ( 26 ) .
The remaining c-Rel-selected sequences do not comprise any known kB sequences ; however , several sequences differ from known « B motifs by only Mor .

a single nucleotide ( usually in the 5 ' half-site ) .
On the basis of the alignment of the c-Rel-selected sequences ( Fig .
3B ) , a 10-nt consensus , NGGRN ( A/T ) TTCC , can be assigned .
It remains to be determined whether any of the novel sequences that bind to p50 , p65 , and/or c-Rel are present and function as authentic Rel protein-binding motifs in the regulatory regions of any genes .
A subset of selected sequences display differential binding to Rel family proteins .
To establish whether the DNA-binding sites selected by one Rel-related protein exhibit differential affinities for the other family members , every clone from each group was assessed for binding to all three ( p50 , p65 , and c-Rel ) Rel-related proteins ( Fig .
1A , 2A , and 3A ) .
Surprisingly , several selected sequences from each group displayed either weak or no binding affinity for the other Rel-related proteins .
As an example , clone 50-14 , which was selected for binding to p50 , did not bind to p65 ( Fig .
1A ) .
Similarly , clone 65-2 , selected for binding to p65 , did not bind to p50 ( Fig .
2A ) , and clone rel-12 , selected for binding to c-Rel , did not bind p50 ( Fig .
3A ) .
An interesting observation apparent from Fig .
1 and 2 is that all p50- and p6S-selected sequences also bound well to c-Rel .
However , when DNA was selected for binding to c-Rel , sequences that did not bind to either p50 ( rel-12 ) or p65 ( rel-10 ) or both p50 and p65 ( rel-5 ) were obtained .
This observation suggests that the DNA sequence requirements for binding of c-Rel are less stringent , since c-Rel bound to every sequence examined .
Sequence analysis of the selective motifs may provide some clues relating to their specificity of interaction with the Rel-related proteins .
Upon sequence analysis of the pS5O-selected clones that demonstrated little or no binding to p65 ( Fig .
1 ) , clone 50-2 is noteworthy since the sequence contains a G in position 10 .
Mutation of this G to a C completely restored the ability of this motif to bind to p65 ( data not shown ) .
Analysis of the p65-selected sequences ( Fig .
2B ) demonstrates an absolute conservation of C 's in positions 9 and 10 .
Consequently , it appears that binding of p65 has a strong requirement for the presence of at least two C 's in the extreme 3 ' end of the binding motif .
It is also interesting to note that clones 50-6 , 50-8 , and 50-14 , all of which bound weakly to p65 ( Fig .
1A ) , contain a G in either ( or both ) position 6 or 7 .
Furthermore , clone 50-14 , which has two G 's in positions 6 and 7 , appears to have the most reduced affinity for p65 ( Fig .
1A ) .
Substitution of the G in position 7 of clone 50-14 for a T increased the ability of this decameric sequence to bind to p65 by approximately sevenfold ( data not shown ) .
Analysis of the p65-selected clones ( Fig .
2B ) reveals that T ( but never a G ) is highly conserved in these positions .
These observations suggest that a G in position 6 or 7 , although able to bind to p50 , is not tolerated for binding to p65 .
Sequence comparisons of the p65-selected clones that did not bind p50 ( clones 65-2 , -8 , -9 , -10 , -16 , and -18 ) reveal that all contain a C or T ( rather than a G ) in position 1 .
This finding suggests that binding of the p50 homodimer requires three consecutive G 's in positions 1 to 3 of the 5 ' half-site ; this view is supported by the absolute conservation of G 's in positions 1 to 3 of the pS5Q0-selected sequences ( Fig .
1B ) .
Careful inspection reveals that the consensus , as written , for clones 65-5 and 65-6 includes a C in position 1 , although both of these clones bound to p50 to some extent .
However , analysis of the opposite strands of these clones places three G 's followed by three A 's in positions 1 to 6 and two C 's in positions 9 and 10 .
This configuration may provide the binding site for p50 .
On the contrary , clones 65-2 , -8 , -9 , -10 , -16 , and -18 can not be oriented in any way to provide an Vor .

Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrating differential binding specificity of selective kB oligonucleotides .
*°P-labeled oligonucleotides containing only the predicted xB motifs from the DNA sequence analysis of the differently binding clones ( Fig .
3 ) were tested for the ability to bind selectively to p50 ( lane 1 ) , p65 ( lane 2 ) , and c-Rel ( lane 3 ) .
An equivalent amount of each protein was reacted with the various probes .
The specific « B sequence contained within each probe is given in Materials and Methods .
The « B probe is the sequence derived from the Ig < light-chain enhancer and is also equivalent to the « B sequence found in the HIV-1 LTR .
optimal binding consensus for p50 .
Taken together , these observations indicate that although p65 can tolerate subtle nucleotide changes in the 5 ' half-site , the binding of p50 is critically dependent upon the presence of three G 's in positions 1 to 3 .
To test directly the contribution of the nucleotide in position 1 for binding to p50 , the C in position 1 of sequence 65-2 ( CGGAATTTCC ) was changed to a G ( 65-2a ) .
As shown in Fig .
4 , this motif could bind to p50 , albeit with a reduced affinity .
Additional experiments performed with probe 65-2a have demonstrated a higher level of binding to p50 than is shown in Fig .
4 ( data not shown ) .
When the C in position -1 of sequence 65-2 was also changed to a G ( along with the C-to-G change in position 1 [ 65-2b ] ) to yield the « B motif GGGGAATTTCC , this sequence bound quite well to p50 and to p65 .
The reproducibly higher binding affinity of p50 obtained with the 65-2b probe may be due to the fact that 65-2b contains an 11-nt xB motif .
It has been suggested that p50 has a preference for an 11-nt « B motif ( 51 ) .
Thus , a single nucleotide change in a p65-selected motif can dramatically alter the binding specificity for p50 homodimers .
To ensure that the DNA motifs as aligned in Fig .
1B , 2B , and 3B represent the actual binding sites for the Rel proteins , as opposed to the contribution of flanking DNA sequence , we synthesized oligonucleotides in which the sequence corresponding to the predicted binding motif of various differently binding clones was inserted between common flanking sequence ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Representative oligonucleotides were then analyzed for selective binding to the individual Rel proteins ( Fig .
4 ) .
The relative binding affinities of the proteins to the selective « B oligonucleotides were identical to that observed with the original PCR-derived probe sequences .
Whereas p50 , p65 , and c-Rel all bound well to the xB sequence ( GGGACTTTCC ) found in the Ig x light-chain enhancer and HIV-1 LTR ( 32 , 48 ) , the p50- selected sequence , 50-14 , exhibited significantly reduced affinity for p65 .
Likewise , the p6S- selected sequence , 65-2 , exhibited a strong affinity for p65 and c-Rel but was unable to bind pSO .
Also , the c-Rel-selected sequence , rel-12 , bound c-Rel but had a much reduced affinity for p50 and p65 .

Analysis of relative affinities of the selective kB oligonucleotides versus the Ig/HIV kB motif for the Rel family of proteins .
Equivalent amounts of either p50 , p65 , corenatured p50 and p65 , or c-Rel were added to increasing amounts of unlabeled selective kB oligonucleotides ( lanes 1 to 4 ) or a 50-fold excess of unlabeled Ig/HIV oligonucleotide ( lane 5 ) ( as competitor DNAs ) and *°P-labeled Ig/HIV oligonucleotide .
The *°P-labeled Ig/HIV probe and the competitor DNAs were mixed prior to addition of the protein .
Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through a 4 % nondenaturing gel as described in Materials and Methods .
sequences shown in Fig .
1B , 2B , and 3B likely represent the actual binding sites .
However , since no binding to p65 was observed with the PCR-derived probe of clone 50-14 ( Fig .
1A ) , it is possible that binding of p65 to this kB sequence ( and perhaps others ) may be context dependent to some extent .
For subsequent studies , the double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the minimal selective binding sequences were used .
As a further confirmation of the selective binding affinity of these different xB sequences , their abilities to compete for binding of the Rel protein homodimers to the Ig/HIV « B motif were examined ( Fig .
5 ) .
Inclusion of excess unlabeled 65-2 oligonucleotide in the binding reaction was effective only in blocking the association of p65 and c-Rel with the Ig/HIV « B oligonucleotide , supporting the data in Fig .
2 and 4 , which demonstrate that p50 homodimers were unable to bind to the 65-2 « kB motif .
As shown by competition for binding to the heterodimeric NF- « B complex ( p50/p65 ) ( pre-pared by corenaturation of the recombinant p50 and p65 proteins ) , the 65-2 « kB motif also could not efficiently bind to the p50/p65 complex .
Excess unlabeled 50-14 oligonucleotide prevented only the interaction of p50 ( and to a lesser extent c-Rel ) with the Ig/HIV « B motif .
This result also supports the data in Fig .
1 and 4 , suggesting that the sequence GGGGAGGCCC , although able to bind very well to p50 , binds weakly to p65 .
Furthermore , 50-14 was unable to compete with the Ig/HIV kB motif for binding to heterodimeric p50/p65 .
Similarly , excess unlabeled rel-12 oligonucleotide was effective only in competing with the Ig/HIV « B sequence for binding to c-Rel , indicating that p50 , p65 , and p50/p65 bind this sequence with a much reduced affinity compared with the Ig/HIV « B motif .

5 only provide clues concerning the relative affinities of the various selective kB motifs to the Rel family of proteins compared with the proteins ' affinities for Ig/HIV « B DNA 4418 KUNSCH ET AL .

Analysis of binding specificity of the selective kB oligonucleotides for full-length , in vitro-translated p50 and p65 .
Purified , bacterially expressed p50 ( lanes 1 ) and p65 ( lanes 2 ) or full-length , in vitro-translated p50 ( lanes 3 ) and p6S ( lanes 4 ) were incubated with the indicated xB probes , and DNA-protein binding complexes were assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis .
The endogenous « B-binding activity present in the reticulocyte lysates is observed as a faint band migrating between p50 and p65 and is present in the unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate control ( lanes 5 ) .
( as measured by DNA/protein on rates ) , the results support the results of Fig .
1 to 4 and are in complete agreement with the novel DNA-binding motifs exhibiting different binding properties with respect to the Rel family of proteins .
As the differently binding oligonucleotides were identified and tested with truncated recombinant protein derivatives produced in E. coli , it was conceivable that a different binding affinity or specificity might be observed with the full-length , more native protein .
To examine this possibility , radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to selected motifs were incubated with full-length p50 , p65 , or c-Rel protein expressed in a reticulocyte translation lysate and the resultant DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( Fig .
6 ) .
The findings obtained with the in vitro-translated full-length proteins were identical to the results obtained with the recombinant truncated derivatives .
The fact that « B motifs exist that have a preference for one NF- « B subunit over the other is noteworthy , as it was previously assumed that p50 homodimers had a greater affinity for DNA than do p65 homodimers .
These observations suggest the existence of Rel protein-DNA binding motifs that have a clear preference for p65 or c-Rel homodimers rather than p50 , emphasizing that DNA-Rel protein affinity is highly dependent on the individual DNA motif .
Both subunits of NF- « B are required for DNA binding and transcriptional activation .
The observation that the p65 subunit has an affinity equal to or greater than that of p50 for DNA binding , depending on the DNA motif examined , raised the possibility that the individual subunits of the heterodimeric NF- « B complex contribute equally to DNA interaction .
Thus , if both protein subunits must make contact with DNA , neither the 65-2 nor 50-14 sequence , which displays selective binding for only p65 or p50 , respectively , should interact with heterodimeric NF-kB .
To test this prediction , the individual oligonucleotides were incubated with recombinant NF-KB that was prepared by denaturation of p50 and p65 homodimers followed by gradual corenatur-ation .

Inability of the heterodimeric p50/p65 complex to bind to the p50- or p6S-specific « B oligonucleotide .

the individual homodimers , was chosen .
The presence of the p50/p65 complex was confirmed by demonstrating that incubation of the renatured protein mixture with the Ig/HIV « B motif resulted in the formation of a DNA-protein complex with a mobility intermediate to those of the p50 and p65 homodimer complexes ( Fig .
7A ) .
Incubation of either the 65-2 or 50-14 oligonucleotide with the p50/p65 protein mixture resulted in little to no binding of the heterodimeric complex ( Fig .
7A , lanes 2 ) .
However , each oligonucleotide did bind to the respective homodimer that was also present in the mixture .
The band observed in lane 2 with the 65-2 probe represents binding of excess p65 homodimers in the corenatured mixture .
The observation of a weak interaction of the heterodimeric p50/p65 complex with the pS50-selected motif , 50-14 , is most likely due to the excess of protein used in the binding reaction .
With lower protein concentrations , binding of the heterodimeric complex to this probe is not detectable ( data not shown ) .
The data presented in Fig .
5 and 7B further support the conclusion that heterodimeric p50/p65 has very little , if any , binding affinity for the 50-14 binding site .
As an alternative approach to examine the ability of the pS50/p65 heterodimeric complex to bind to the p50- or p65-selected « B sequence , full-length p50 and p65 proteins were translated individually or together in a reticulocyte lysate and used in a binding assay with the selective kB motifs ( Fig .
7B ) .
The plasmid used to direct the expression of p65 encoded an extra 10 amino acids from the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein at the amino terminus of p65 ( HAp65 ) ( 23 ) .

When the cotranslated p50/HAp65 protein was incubated with the Ig/HIV kB motif ( Fig .
7B , lane 3 ) , a complex of intermediate mobility with respect to p50 ( lane 2 ) or HAp65 ( lane 4 ) alone was observed .
However , the selective « kB motifs 65-2 ( lanes 5 to 7 ) and 50-14 ( lanes 8 to 10 ) bound only to the protein from which they were selected and did not bind to the other homodimer or the p50/HAp65 cotranslated heterodimer , in agreement with the results obtained with the purified recombinant proteins ( Fig .
7A ) .
These results are also in agreement with the data presented in Fig .
5 , which demonstrate the inability of the p50/p65 heterodimer to bind to the p50- or p6S-selected competitor oligonucleotide .
The results presented above suggest that DNA contacts by both the p50 and p65 subunits of NF- « B are required for binding of the NF- < B heterodimer to DNA .
To examine whether the selective binding sites would display similar affinities in the more physiologically relevant in vivo envi-ronment , these sequences were used to drive expression of a CAT reporter gene in transient transfection assays .
For these experiments , four copies of the individual motifs were used to replace the authentic « kB elements present in the HIV-1 LTR .
Previous studies have established that the HIV-1 LTR is responsive to NF- « B and that induction is mediated through the NF- « B motif ( 32 ) .
To achieve activation , Jurkat T cells were transfected with either the p50 or p65 expression vector or an expression vector encoding the DNA-binding domain of p50 and the carboxy-terminal activation domain of p65 ( p50/65 ) ( 43 ) .
This expression vector encodes a chimeric protein that retains the binding specificity of the p50 protein while providing activation through the p65 protein ( 43 ) and was necessary to demonstrate p50-dependent activation , since little to no transcriptional activation is seen with transfection of the p50 expression vector alone ( Fig .
8 , lane 2 ) .
To induce NF- « B activity , cells were stimulated with PMA 12 h prior to cell harvest .
CAT expression in cells transfected with the reporter plasmid p ( Ig/HIVkB ) , CAT , which contains four copies of the authentic HIV-1 kB motif , was activated by both the p65 and p50/65 expression vectors ( Fig .
8 ) .
Activation was also seen following PMA treatment , which is known to induce NF- « B-binding activity ( 47 , 48 ) and transcriptional activation ( 32 ) .
Activation was specific for the xB motif , as no CAT expression was observed with the reporter plasmid p ( Mut « B ) , CAT , which contains several point mutations within the individual kB motifs that abolish binding to NF-KB ( 32 ) .
In contrast , CAT expression directed by the 50-14 sequence [ p ( 50-14xB ) , CAT ] was activated by the p50/65 expression vector but not by the p50 or p65 expression vector alone or by PMA stimulation .
Analysis of other p50-selected motifs failed to demonstrate activation by the p50 expression plasmid ( data not shown ) .
Similarly , CAT expression directed by the 65-2 sequence [ p ( 65-2 « B ) , CAT ] was activated by the p65 expression vector and not by the p50/65 expression vector .
Very weak activation was observed with PMA stimulation .
Therefore , each motif was responsive to induction via the corresponding homodimer and was not responsive to NF-kB that was induced by PMA treatment , in agreement with findings obtained in vitro .
These data further support the in vitro binding specificities of the selective kB motifs and provide evidence that NF- « B-mediated transcriptional activation requires both subunits of the NF- « B complex to bind to DNA .

Transcriptional activation mediated by Rel protein-selec-tive xB motifs .
Jurkat T cells were transfected with the indicated reporter plasmids containing four tandem copies of the various « B motifs within the natural context of the HIV-1 LTR cloned upstream of the bacterial CAT gene .
The reporter plasmids ( 1 jpg ) were transfected either alone ( lane 1 ) or with 2 ug of CMV expression vectors encoding p50 ( lane 2 ) , chimeric p50/65 ( encoding the DNA-binding function of p50 and transactivation function of p65 ; lane 3 ) , p65 ( lane 4 ) , and chimeric Rel/p65 ( encoding the DNA-binding function of c-Rel and transactivation function of p65 ; lane 5 ) .
Some samples were treated with PMA 12 h prior to harvest ( lane 6 ) .
DISCUSSION Although previous studies have in fact demonstrated that p50 , p65 , and c-Rel can bind to various kB DNA elements found in the regulatory regions of many genes ( 1 ) , we examined the optimal , unbiased DNA-binding sites preferred by homodimeric p50 , p65 , and c-Rel to address whether each of the Rel-related proteins can bind to similar kB DNA motifs .
Results from the binding site selection indicate that the various homodimeric Rel proteins display preferential binding to slightly different DNA sequence elements .
Analysis of the 18 sequences that were selected for binding to p50 reveals that all conform to the consensus 5-GGGGATYCCC-3 ' and that those selected for binding to p65 conform to the consensus 5-GGGRNTTTCC-3 ' .
Analyses of the various binding sites indicate that less variation is tolerated in the 5 ' half-site of the p50-selected sites , whereas less variation occurs in the 3 ' half-site of the p65-selected sites .
This finding supports the previous observation that p50 prefers binding to the 5 ' half-site and p65 prefers binding to the 3 ' half-site ( 51 ) .
The c-Rel-selected sequences showed the most variation ; however , the sequences in the 3 ' half-site appeared to be more conserved .
This finding likely reflects the high degree of amino acid sequence homology between c-Rel and p65 .
The fact that there was considerable variation in the c-Rel-selected sequences and the observation that c-Rel bound to every p50- and p6S-selected sequence might suggest that the binding of p50 and p65 entails more specificity than does c-Rel binding .
Many of the c-Rel-selected sequences bear little resemblance to previously defined kB 4420 KUNSCH ET AL .
motifs .
Interestingly , one of the c-Rel-selected sequences ( rel-17 ) contains the sequence GGTTTTTCC , which is very similar to the DNA element ( GAATTTTCC ) localized in the gamma interferon intronic enhancer .
This sequence was shown to bind to c-Rel and was suggested to be involved in transcriptional regulation of interferon-stimulated genes ( 49 ) .
Although the binding site selection indicates that the preferred DNA sequences for each Rel protein can conform to a consensus , it is noteworthy that a variety of sequences were selected for binding to each homodimer .
Several of the selected sequences are identical to the xB elements found in the regulatory regions of < B-regulated genes ; however , several novel kB motifs were identified .
It is tempting to speculate that the novel « B sequences identified in this study may exist in as yet unidentified « B-regulated genes .
Consequently , the observation that several novel « B motifs can bind optimally to either p50 , p65 , or c-Rel homodimers suggests the existence of more genes that are regulated by NF-KB or NF- « B-like proteins through these DNA motifs .
Perhaps one of the most unexpected findings of this study was obtained when the selective motifs were examined for binding to other ( nonselected ) Rel proteins .
Within each group of selected motifs there was a subset of sequence elements that exhibited little to no binding to the nonselected proteins .
The demonstration of DNA-binding motifs that bind to p65 but not p50 is important in itself , as it dispels the earlier assumption that p50 has a greater affinity for kB DNA .
Moreover , this observation should lend caution to generalizations made regarding Rel protein-DNA affinity and suggests that DNA-Rel protein affinity can be viewed only with respect to specific DNA sequences .
Furthermore , the observation that different kB motifs are able to form selective associations with specific homo- or heterodimeric Rel protein combinations suggests that in vivo , the cell may use this type of differential recognition of binding elements to fine-tune its response to various external signals .
Earlier studies by Urban et al .
( 51 ) demonstrated that NF- « B contacts DNA as a heterodimer .
These studies showed that both the p50 and p65 subunits of the intact NF- « B complex could be cross-linked to the « B site in the beta interferon gene .
The results presented here support and extend the observations of Urban et al .
( 51 ) by demonstrating that interaction of both subunits of the p50/p65 heterodimeric complex is a requirement for both NF-KB binding and transcriptional activation and that the sole interaction of either of the subunits in the p50/p6S5 heterodimer is not sufficient for the binding or transcriptional activity of NF- « B .
Although transcriptional activation mediated by the 65-2-driven kB motif was not responsive to the p50/65 fusion protein , it was activated by the p65 expression vector and did demonstrate slight activation following PMA treatment .
It is unlikely that this activation reflects binding of NF- « B , because under conditions of protein excess , no interaction of NF-kB with this motif was observed in vitro .
This activity may thus reflect induction of a different Rel-related protein complex or the induction of p65 , which is slightly induced following mito-genic stimulation ( 22a ) .
The latter possibility suggests that p65 homodimers may exist at some low level in the cell and may be available for transcriptional transactivation of certain « kB motifs .
The lack of transcriptional activation seen on all of the « B-binding sites examined in response to the p50 expression vector supports previous suggestions that in vivo , p50 homodimers do not confer transcriptional activity .
This view is in contrast to recent observations demonstrating that p50 homodimers can activate transcription from certain < B-binding sites in an in vitro transcription system ( 11 , 24 ) .

The facts that ( i ) several novel DNA-binding sequences were identified , many of which differ greatly from the consensus kB sequence , and ( ii ) many of the unbiased selected sequences bound differentially to the Rel protein homodimers may lead to a broader understanding of NF- « B regulation .
As the presence of a consensus site within a promoter element usually provides the first suggestion that expression of a particular gene may be regulated by NF-KB , the repertoire of genes regulated by the Rel family of proteins can now be potentially expanded .
Taken together , our observations suggest that regulation of gene expression by the Rel family of proteins will be far more complex than originally thought .
Thus , in addition to the various homo- and heterodimeric combinations conferring distinct binding properties , it is now clear that numerous xB motifs that have preferential binding affinities for the Rel proteins may exist .
These results predict , as has been suggested for the nuclear receptors and their binding elements ( 31 ) , that variations in the sequence and configuration of « kB DNA motifs will permit selective and specific actions of the Rel family of transcription factors .
Furthermore , our observations suggest that DNA contact of both the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-KB is required for DNA binding and transcriptional activation of the NF- « B complex .
