Anti-Ro ( SSA ) Autoantibodies Are Associated with T Cell Receptor B Genes in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Patients Mark Barton Frank , * Robert McArthur , ** `` John B. Harley , *** and Atsushi Fujisaku* *Arthritis and Immunology Program , Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation ; *Department of Medicine , University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center ; and Veterans Administration Hospital , Oklahoma City , Oklahoma 73104 Abstract Several of the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus have been associated with specific autoantibodies .
Associations between HLA class II antigens and autoantibodies to the ribonucleoproteins Ro ( SSA ) and La ( SSB ) have been reported in these patients .
Because HLA class II molecules present antigen to T cell receptors ( TCRs ) , we have searched for a TCR gene associated with the production of anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies .
A pair of restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) , one of which hybridizes to the TCR constant region C # 1 and the other to the C32 gene , has been identified , suggesting these may be genotypic markers for an extended region of the TCR locus .
This RFLP pair occurs in 76 % of patients with Ro ( SSA ) precipitins , 84 % of anti-Ro ( SSA ) -positive patients lacking La ( SSB ) precipitins , but only 41 % of the patients lacking both precipitins ( P = 0.0004 ) .
This disproportionate occurrence in a subset of lupus patients indicates that these RFLPs are not disease susceptibility markers , but rather are important markers for TCR genes whose products are involved in the production of anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies .
The majority of patients who have these RFLPs and HLA class II antigens previously associated with the anti-Ro ( SSA ) response make this antibody , suggesting that interactions between products of these loci occur in response to Ro ( SSA ) .

Associations between the HLA class II antigens HLA-DR2 , -DR3 , and -DR7 with the disease exist ( 5-8 ) .
Because of linkage disequilibrium between these loci and others in the HLA region , it remains to be determined whether these or alleles at other linked loci are most closely associated with disease predisposition ( 8-13 ) .
Recent work indicates that not only the disease as a whole , but also the presence of particular lupus autoantibodies are associated with histocompatibility genes ( 14-18 ) .
Ro ( SSA ) is a ribonucleoprotein particle consisting of a polypeptide chain of ~60 kD associated with one of four small ( 83-112 base ) RNA molecules ( 19-22 ) .
This complex , whose function is currently unknown , is present in all mammalian cells that have been studied .
Anti-Ro ( SSA ) autoantibodies are typically found in 30-50 % of lupus patients and in up to 96 % of patients with primary Sjogren 's syndrome ( 21 , 23 ) .
In lupus patients these antibodies are associated with lymphopenia , photosensitive dermatitis , and pulmonary disease ( 15 , 17 , 24-27 ) .
Antibodies against Ro ( SSA ) are enriched in acid eluates of nephritic kidneys of lupus patients when compared with their serum antibody levels , suggesting their role in lupus nephritis ( 28 ) .
Exogenous anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies deposit in human skin grafts on severe combined immune deficiency mice in patterns similar to those seen in skin lesions of subacute cutaneous lupus patients ( 29 ) .
The close association of maternal anti-Ro ( SSA ) with neonatal dermatitis and complete congenital heart block further suggests a pathogenic role for these antibodies ( 30-32 ) .
Patients with La ( SSB ) precipitins constitute a subset of those with Ro ( SSA ) precipitins .
This patient subset differs in the frequencies of the HLA-DR2 and -DR3 antigens when compared with those having only anti-Ro ( SSA ) precipitins ( 11 , 15 ) .
In lupus patients the mutual occurrence of both antibodies is associated with a low frequency of renal disease when compared with patients with only anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies ( 17 , 24 ) , and a high prevalence of photosensitivity , discoid rash , and sicca symptoms ( 23 , 24 , 33 , 34 ) .
In the absence of cytotoxic chemotherapy , the presence of both of these antibodies is stable irrespective of disease activity ( 24 ) .
These findings suggest that genetic and clinical differences exist between the anti-Ro ( SSA ) -positive patients with and without the anti-La ( SSB ) autoantibody , and patients lacking the anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies .
Anti-Ro ( SSA ) autoantibodies in lupus patients have been associated with HLA class II antigens ( 14-16 , 18 , 35 , 36 ) .
In models of T cell activation , antigen is presented by MHC proteins to the T cell receptor ( TCR ) .
However , no investigations have shown differences between TCR genes of lupus patients and healthy controls ( 37-39 ) .
These studies have considered lupus as a single disease entity without consideration of the heterogeneous antibody profiles or HLA class II differences of these patients , and therefore do not mean that important rela- T Cell Receptor Genes and Anti-Ro ( SSA ) Antibodies in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus _ 33 tionships with TCRs do not exist .
In this study we have investigated the role of TCRs in the production of anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies .
The immunologically defined subgroup of patients with this autoantibody is more homogeneous genetically and clinically than the group of lupus patients as a whole .
The combination of a new restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) with the previously described Bgl II TCR # RFLP permitted us to identify a genotypic marker that is strongly associated with anti-Ro ( SSA ) autoantibodies .
Our data further suggested that a TCR gene product may interact with particular HLA class II antigens in the development or perpetuation of this autoimmune response .
This is the first example of an association between a TCR gene and an immune response to a known autoantigen in humans .
Methods DNA probes .
Human cDNA ( 40 ) subcloned in pBR322 was graciously provided by J. D. Capra ( University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX ) .
The 770-bp Pst I insert was electropho-retically isolated from the plasmid DNA and digested with Bgl II .
A ~ 400-bp fragment that contained the first , second , and a few nucleotides of the third exon of the TCR constant region ( CB ) was ligated into the pUC19 vector and transformed into the Escherichia coli strain TBI ( 41 ) .
This TCR C # insert was isolated using a preparative 5 % N , N'-bis-acrylylcystamine crosslinked polyacrylamide gel ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Richmond , CA ) and DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chro-matography , and used as a probe in this study .
Patients and DNA protocols .
A minimum of 30 ml of anticoagu-lated peripheral blood was collected from 70 female and 6 male patients diagnosed with SLE ( 42 ) .
The average patient age was 40.6 yr , with a range of 22-80 yr. 46 patients were Caucasians , 26 were Black , 3 were American Indians , and 1 was Chinese .
Peripheral blood samples were also collected from 25 healthy individuals .
No one in the latter group was known to have SLE in their family .
The frequency of the RFLPs did not vary with the age or sex of the participants .
The frequency of one RFLP ( the Bgl II 9.8-kb RFLP ) was slightly increased in Blacks when compared with Caucasians .
No racial differences were noted in the frequency of the Kpn I RFLPs or in the frequency of the combined Bgl II 9.8- and Kpn I 1.75-kb RFLP in controls or in patients who produced the anti-Ro autoantibody when grouped by race .
Because of these preliminary findings and the small number of individuals present in racially and autoantibody-defined groups , patients were pooled irrespective of age , sex , or race in this study .
Buffy coat leukocytes were lysed with 1 % Triton X-100 ( Aldrich Chemical Co. , Milwaukee , WI ) in 0.32 M sucrose , 10 mM Tris-HCI , and 5 mM MgCl , pH 7.5 .
The centrifugal pellet was resuspended in 75 mM NaCl and 25 mM EDTA and digested with 200 ug/ml proteinase K ( Bethesda Research Laboratories , Gaithersburg , MD ) in 0.5 % SDS at 37°C overnight .
The following day , 5 ug RNAse ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) was added for 30 min , followed by four phenol-CHCI ; -isoamyl alcohol extractions and ethanol precipitation .
The isolated DNA was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA .
10-ug samples of DNA were digested with restriction enzymes in buffer provided by the enzymes ' suppliers ( Promega Biotech [ Madi-son , WI ] , Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals [ Indianapolis , IN ] , and Bethesda Research Laboratories ) .
Samples were subjected to electro-phoresis in 0.8 % agarose gels in TBE buffer ( 0.1 M Tris , 0.1 M boric acid , and 2 mM EDTA at pH 8.0 ) at 40 V for 16-18 h. DNA was transferred to nylon membranes ( Amersham Corp. [ Arlington Heights , IL ] or Gelman Sciences , Inc. [ Ann Arbor , MI ) by the method of Southern ( 43 ) , and prehybridized for 4 h at 65°C in 5 % SSPE ( 0.75 M NaCl , 50 mM NaH ; PO , /H ; 0 , 5 mM EDTA , pH 7.0 ) , 10 % Den-hardt 's solution ( 0.2 % BSA , 0.2 % ficoll , 0.2 % polyvinylpyrrolidone ) , 5 % dextran sulfate , 0.1 % SDS , 50 mM phosphate buffer , and 50 ug/ml 34 - M. B. Frank , R. McArthur , J .
B. Harley , and A. Fujisaku of denatured salmon sperm DNA .
The prehybridization solution was replaced with fresh solution and hybridization was performed overnight at 65°C with the radiolabeled TCR CS probe ( 44 , 45 ) .
Membranes were washed at high stringency with 0.2 % SSPE and 0.1 % SDS at 65°C .
Sizes of RFLP bands were estimated by autoradiography ( X-Omat AR film ; Eastman Kodak Co. , Rochester , NY ) relative to the migration of Hind III-digested lambda bacteriophage DNA and Hae III-digested phiX-174 DNA ( Bethesda Research Laboratories , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
Detection of patient autoantibodies .
Patient sera were analyzed for the presence of anti-Ro ( SSA ) and anti-La ( SSB ) antibodies against bovine spleen extracts relative to reference sera by Ouchterlony immuno-diffusion and counter immunoelectrophoresis ( 19 , 24 ) .
Statistical analysis .
Statistical analysis of RFLPs was carried out using Fisher 's exact test with the Epistat software package for PC-based computer systems ( T. Gustafson , Round Rock , TX ) .
The chi-square test was used to test for homogeneity and genotypic differences between groups .
Statistical levels of confidence are shown without adjustment for the number of comparisons made .
Results In preliminary experiments DNA from 13 patients was digested with the restriction enzymes Bgl II , Eco RI , Eco RV , Hind IH , Kpn I ( or its isoschizomer Asp 718 ) , Pst I , Pvu II , and Taq I. Polymorphic bands hybridizing to the human TCR probe were only detected after digestion with Bgl II or Kpn I .
The paucity of RFLPs in these patients is consistent with that observed in a previous report in healthy individuals ( 46 ) .
The enzyme Bgl II produced 9.8- and 8.8-kb polymorphic fragments and a 1.2-kb fragment present in all individuals .
Digestion with Kpn I revealed 5.6- and 1.7 5-kb polymorphic fragments and a 7.1-kb constant fragment .
The Bgl II RFLP has been shown to be inherited as an allelic variant ( 39 , 46-48 ) .
Family studies in our laboratory confirm that both the Bgl II and Kpn I RFLPs are inherited as alleles of a single autosomal locus ( data not shown ) .
During the course of this work , Oksenberg et al .
( 47 ) reported that Kpn I RFLPs similar in size to those we observed were inherited as alleles in three families .
The location of the polymorphic Bgl II restriction site has been determined ( 46 , 48 , 49 ) .
Invariant Bgl II sequences are present in the first exon of the CS1 and C2 genes , while the Bgl II site 678 nucleotides 5 ' of the CB2 invariant site is poly-morphic .
Therefore , the Bgl II RFLPs are a result of hybridization of the TCR C # probe to the CS1 gene .
To determine the location of the Kpn I polymorphic site we initially searched a computer data base for human TCR nucleotide sequences and located Kpn I sites between the second and third exons of the CB1 and C82 genes ( 49 ) .
A third Kpn I site was found 1.8 kb 5 ' of the Kpn I sequence in the intron of the CB2 , but not the C31 gene .
Because this is similar in size to one of the Kpn I RFLPs we observed , we used the presence of the polymorphic Bgl II site in this region to test the hypothesis that the Kpn I RFLPs are due to hybridization of the TCR CB probe to the CB2 gene .
Double digestions using Kpn I and Bgl II produced three fragment sizes .
A 0.91-kb fragment was detected in everyone and corresponded to the probe hybridizing to the C # I1 gene ( Fig .
1 ) .
The polymorphic 0.98- and 1.05-kb fragments found in individuals with the Kpn I 1.75- and 5.6-kb RFLPs , respectively , were as predicted if the polymorphic Kpn I site occurs between the second and third CS2 exon .

third constant region exons , no hybridization was detected after Kpn I digestion with DNA 3 ' of the C81 Kpn I site or with the homologous portions of the CS2 gene in individuals with the 1.75-kb Kpn I RFLP .
Therefore , while the Bgl II RFLPs were detected by hybridization of the probe with the CB1 gene , the Kpn I RFLPs were due to hybridization with the C # 2 gene .
This suggests that combinations of these RFLPs may be useful as markers for an extended region of this portion of the ge-nome , which includes not only exons coding for constant portions of T cell receptor polypeptides , but for variable regions ( D8 and J8 ) as well .
Because strong associations between HLA class II region markers and anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies have been described in lupus patients , we wished to determine if the markers for the TCR genes we identified might be useful in detecting associations between TCR genes and the anti-Ro ( SSA ) response .
An increase in the allelic frequency of the Bgl II 9.8-kb ( P = 0.05 ) as well as the Kpn I 1.75-kb ( P = 0.05 ) RFLP was found in the 42 patients with the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin when compared with the 34 patients who lacked this precipitin ( Table I ) .

cally , Bgl II 9.8-kb homozygotes occurred more frequently in the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin-positive group ( P = 0.02 ) .
However , these differences were not statistically significant after multiplying the probability values by the number of comparisons made .
When analyzed together , the Bgl II and Kpn I RFLPs may act as a marker for an extended region of the TCR locus , and otherwise identify genes that are important in the recognition of the Ro ( SSA ) autoantigen .
Consistent with this hypothesis , we noted that 32 of the 37 patients with the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin who had the Bgl II 9.8-kb RFLP ( Table I ) also had the Kpn I 1.75-kb RFLP .
Table II shows that the combination of these two RFLPs was present in 76 % of the patients with Ro ( SSA ) precipitins .
In contrast , it occurred in only 14 of 34 patients ( 41 % ) lacking this precipitin , resulting in a highly significant difference between these two patient groups ( P = 0.002 ) .
When all 76 lupus patients were considered as a single group , the frequency of these two Bgl II and Kpn I RFLPs did not differ from that found in 25 healthy subjects ( Table III ) .
These results are consistent with those of others who have failed to find differences when comparing the Bgl II RFLPs between SLE patients and controls ( 37-39 ) .
The joint occurrence of these two RFLPs does not , therefore , appear to be a risk factor for the disease .
Rather , the RFLP combination is a marker for TCR # genes involved in the production of anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies in a subset of lupus patients ( Table III ) .
We have initiated experiments to determine whether the Bgl II 9.8- and Kpn I 1.75-kb markers preferentially occur on the same chromosome in lupus patients with the anti-Ro ( SSA ) Allelic distributi has .

T Cell Receptor Genes and Anti-Ro ( SSA ) Antibodies in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus -_ 35 in 9 of the 15 Ro ( SSA ) precipitin-negative patients that we have studied .
Fully informative pedigrees must be analyzed from additional patients before definitive results can be reached on this issue .
However , these findings suggest that the mere presence of these RFLPs on the same chromosome is not sufficient for production of the anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies in lupus patients .
Detection of a functional exon that codes for a TCR polypeptide recognizing the Ro ( SSA ) autoantigen will be required to determine whether these two RFLP markers are in linkage disequilibrium with such a gene .
As discussed in the introduction , patients with the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin differ genetically at HLA loci and clinically from patients with both the Ro ( SSA ) and La ( SSB ) precipitins .
We have , therefore , divided the Ro ( SSA ) -positive patients into two groups based on the presence or absence of La ( SSB ) precipitins .
A homogeneity chi-square test of the combined presence of the Bg !
II 9.8- and Kpn I 1.75-kb RFLPs revealed significant differences between these two patient subsets ( P < 0.05 ) , suggesting on the basis of these RFLPs that patients in these groups should not be pooled .
As expected in a cohort of this size ( 76 patients ) , the number of patients with both precipitins is small , and therefore conclusions regarding this particular subgroup should be considered tentative .
Table IV shows that the proportion of patients with Ro ( SSA ) and La ( SSB ) precipitins who have both the Bgl II 9.8- and Kpn I 1.75-kb RFLPs is more similar to that found in patients lacking the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin ( P = 0.33 ) than to patients with just the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin ( P = 0.06 ) .
These two RFLPs occur in 84 % of the patients with only the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin , thus reducing the probability eightfold ( P = 0.0004 ) compared with that observed when Ro ( SSA ) -positive and -negative patients , irrespective of their La ( SSB ) precipitin status were analyzed above .
Of the 32 Ro ( SSA ) precipitin-positive patients with both of these RFLPs , 26 of them lacked La ( SSB ) precipitins .
Due to sample size , these findings suggest , but do not prove , that the group of Ro ( SSA ) precipitin-positive patients lacking La ( SSB ) precipitins are responsible for the differences between the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin-positive and -negative patients .
High titers of anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies have previously been described in HLA-DQ1/DQ2 heterozygous patients with primary Sjogren 's syndrome and SLE ( 14 , 17 ) .
In this patient cohort , 11 of the 26 ( 42 % ) HLA typed patients with only the anti-Ro ( SSA ) precipitin are HLA-DQ1/DQ2 heterozygotes , compared with only 2 of 22 ( 9 % ) HLA-DQ typed anti-Ro ( SSA ) -negative patients ( P = 0.01 ) .

B. Harley , and A. Fujisaku Ro ( SSA ) antigen in conjunction with HLA class II molecules , one would expect to find an association between these TCR markers and these HLA-DQ antigens in Ro ( SSA ) precipitin-positive but not -negative patients .
The Ro ( SSA ) precipitin was found in 20 of 24 patients ( 83 % ) with the HLA-DQ antigen who also had the TCR RFLP markers , but in only 4 of the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin-negative patients with these markers ( P = 0.004 ) .
The DQ2 serotype ( P = 0.065 ) and DQ1/DQ2 heterozygosity ( P = 0.013 ) were less strongly associated with these markers .
The frequency of the joint occurrence of the HLA-DQ1 serotype and the TCR # RFLPs in healthy individuals was similar to that in the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin-negative patients ( P = 0.39 ) .
An association of this nature is not expected if the TCRB RFLPs are not markers for a functional TCR gene or regulatory element involved in TCR gene ex-pression .
These studies suggest the existence of a multigenic interaction between products of these loci in the generation of anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies .
Discussion In this study we identified TCRB RFLPs that occur in a disproportionately high frequency in a subset of SLE patients with anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies .
The majority of these patients lack anti-La ( SSB ) antibodies .
Since no differences were found with respect to these RFLPs between patients when considered as a single group and healthy subjects , these RFLPs appear to be markers for the production of specific autoantibodies in lupus rather than risk factors for the disease .
In studies by others the presence of Ro { ( SSA ) and La ( SSB ) precipitins has been associated with clinical and genetic differences among lupus patients ( 11 , 15 , 17 , 24-26 ) .
Given findings of the pathophysio-logic significance of anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies in lupus , these results suggest a role for TCR genes in the disease process .
Five patients who make only anti-Ro antibodies lack the Bgl II 9.8- and Kpn I 1.75-kb RFLPs .
This finding and the observation that this RFLP combination is present in nearly half of all participants without detectable levels of anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies suggest that the RFLP markers themselves are neither necessary nor sufficient for the anti-Ro ( SSA ) response .
This is not surprising considering that the nucleotide sequence differences of either of these polymorphic sites do not occur in coding regions , and therefore do not alter the amino acid sequence of TCR polypeptides .
We hypothesize that these RFLPs are genotypic markers for a TCR VB , DS , or J8 gene coding for the variable portion of a TCR molecule that recognizes the Ro ( SSA ) antigen in patients with the Ro ( SSA ) precipitin .
The lack of a complete association between this precipitin and the RFLP markers for this functional gene may be due to a number of possibilities .
The absence of an appropriate HLA-encoded antigen-presenting molecule is the most attractive hypothesis , although other possibilities must be con-sidered .
Recombination may occur between these markers and the putative anti-Ro ( SSA ) TCR gene , or a second TCR gene may be involved with the production of anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies in some patients .
Each of these hypotheses is testable once such a functional gene is identified .
We may also have failed to detect low levels of anti-Ro ( SSA ) or anti-La ( SSB ) antibodies in some of the patients studied with the immunoprecipitation methods used here .
Given the random rearrangement of VB-D§-J $ 8 exons as well as N-region diversity in the formation of a functional TCR variable region gene , it may be unusual to find absolute associations between expressed TCR genes and human diseases in random populations .
Whether these two polymorphic sites are markers for one or more than one region in the TCR gene complex can not be determined from existing data .
This RFLP pair may be a marker for a particular TCR $ variable gene component .
The close proximity of the DB and J 8 genes to these markers makes them more likely candidates than V $ genes .
Coding sequences of the Df and JG genes have been shown to be of critical importance by Rupp et al .
, who have demonstrated that differences in these coding regions confer differential specificity to TCR molecules that have otherwise identical VB sequences ( 50 ) .
While recombination has been found between V/ and C # genes ( 51 ) , evidence for linkage disequilibrium between at least a portion of the VB genes and certain VB and C # genes has been reported ( 52 ) , suggesting the possibility that these RFLPs may be a marker for a TCR V $ gene .
However , the weakness of the latter association may imply that genes other than those in V $ families are responsible for the findings reported here .
Currently , data suggesting that specific sequences are expressed in a particular immune response remain controversial .
On the one hand , different VB sequences have been reported in murine MHC-restricted T cell clones that respond to defined peptide determinants ( 53 , 54 ) , suggesting that TCR variable genes alone are not responsible for specific-ity .
In contrast , specific VSB genes seem to be preferentially utilized in murine experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and collagen-induced arthritis ( 54-57 ) .
While the few weak associations of VB genes are at the disease rather than the autoantibody level , characterization of specific autoantigens and the T cells that respond to them is needed to determine what roles specific TCR VB genes play in lupus and other human autoimmune disorders characterized by autoantibodies .
Finally , one of these RFLPs may be associated with regulatory rather than coding elements in or adjacent to the TCR C $ exons .
Recently , Krimpenfort et al .
identified a TCR enhancer located downstream of the C # 2 gene in mice ( 58 ) .
With the existing data we can not eliminate more complicated models .
For instance , one of the RFLPs reported here may be in linkage disequilibrium with a variable coding exon and the other with a polymorphic regulatory element , making the combination of the RFLPs a marker for an extended region of the TCR $ genes .
Our observation of a strong association between the and the HLA-DQ 1 serotype in Ro ( SSA ) precipitin-positive patients is particularly interesting in light of recent studies of HLA-D antigens and the presence of this autoantibody .
Hamilton et al .
( 15 ) found a significant association with DR2 ( and DQ1 with which it is in linkage disequilibrium ) but not DR3 ( or DQ2 ) in SLE patients with the Ro ( SSA ) but not the La ( SSB ) antibodies , again suggesting that it is this group of patients that may be responsible for these findings .
However , using stepwise logistic regression analysis in this and other reports ( 15 , 17 ) , DQ1/DQ2 heterozygosity has been most strongly associated with anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies .
Together with data presented here , these findings allow us to expand upon a previous model suggesting a requirement for gene complementation between HLA-DQ1 ( or DR2 ) and HLA-DQ2 ( DR3 ) associated polypeptides for the presentation of the Ro ( SSA ) antigen in lupus and Sjogren 's syndrome patients ( 14 , 15 , 17 ) , to include T cells whose TCR polypeptide in part recognizes an HLA-DQ1-associated antigen complex .
This proposal contradicts data from Kotzin and Palmer ( 59 ) , which showed that mouse MHC but not TCR genes are important in the production of antinuclear antibodies and proteinurea in the ( NZB X NZW ) FI1 model of lupus .
However , this proposal is in agreement with three other reports of murine autoimmune disease models .
Using the same animal model as Kotzin and Palmer , Yanagi et al .
found that both MHC and TCRB genes are important in the development of IgG anti-DNA antibodies and circulating gp70 immune complexes ( 60 ) .
Ghatak et al .
( 61 ) reported that both MHC and TCRB genes are associated with nephritis in ( NZB X SWR ) FI mice , an autoimmune model with different TCR mutations than that mentioned above ( 62 ) , Finally , the susceptibility to collagen-induced arthritis in ( B10 X SWR ) FL hybrid mice has recently been shown to be associated with particular MHC and TCRB gene usage by Banerjee et al .
( 57 ) .
These data suggest that restricted expression of TCR genes in the presence of appropriate MHC gene products may be necessary for the development of particular aspects of autoimmunity .
The ability to appreciate the genetic complexity of lupus may lie in subdividing patients into relatively homogeneous groups for study .
The use of specific autoantibodies in this report is a classification scheme that appears to have patho-physiologic relevance .
Recent studies have demonstrated a high frequency of anti-Ro ( SSA ) antibodies in first degree relatives of anti-Ro ( SSA ) -positive SLE patients when compared with controls ( 63 ) .
Data from Arnett et al .
suggest that both MHC and non-MHC genes are important in this immune response ( 64 ) .
The data presented here provide the first direct evidence for a specific , non-MHC gene involved in the regulation of anti-Ro ( SSA ) autoantibodies .
These data are the first to show an association between a TCR gene and a known human autoantigen , and are consistent with a model proposing that genes at multiple immune response loci determine the presence of particular antibodies in lupus patients , which in turn lead to the differential manifestations of this disease ( 17 , 65 ) .
Acknowledgments We gratefully acknowledge Dr. J. D. Capra of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas for providing a human TCR cDNA clone , and Laurie Soares for excellent technical assistance in isolating and subcloning the TCR CS region used in this work .
