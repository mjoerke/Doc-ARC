Because the translation rate is an important determinant of cell proliferation , we have investigated translation initiation during human myeloid cell differentiation using the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line and the U-937 monoblastic cell line .
A decrease in the translation rate is observed when the cells are induced to differentiate along the monocytic/macrophage pathway or along the granulocytic pathway .
The inhibition in protein synthesis correlates with specific regulation of two repressors of translation initiation , 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 .
Induction of HL-60 and U-937 cell differentiation into monocytes/macrophages by IFN-y or PMA results in a dephosphorylation and consequent activation of 4E-BP1 .
Dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was also observed when U-937 cells were induced to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages following treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO .
In contrast , treatment of HL-60 cells with retinoic acid or DMSO , which results in a granulocytic differentiation of these cells , decreases 4E-BP1 amount without affecting its phosphorylation and strongly increases 4E-BP2 amount .
Taken together , these data provide evidence for differential regulation of the translational machinery during human myeloid differentiation , specific to the monocytic/macrophage pathway or to the granulocytic pathway .

This event proceeds through coordinate expression of numerous genes .
The development of terminally differentiated , nondividing , mature granulocytes and macrophages is accompanied by the loss of the proliferation potential of the precursor cells .
The translation rate in an important determinant of cell proliferation and differentiation , and generally varies in response to treatment with growth factors , cytokines , hormones , and mitogens ( reviewed in Refs .

Most of the control of translation occurs at the level of initiation .
Translation initiation entails the process leading to the positioning of the ribosome at the AUG initiation codon .
Cellular mRNAs contain a cap structure ( m7G ( 5 ' ) ppp ( 5 ) N , in which N is any nucleotide ) at their 5 ' termini ( 4 ) .
The multisubunit translation initiation factor eIF4F binds to the cap structure via the eIF4E subunit to promote ribosome binding ( 2 ) .
Two repressors of cap-mediated translation , termed 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 ( eIF4E-binding proteins-l and -2 ) , also known as PHAS , have been characterized ( 5-7 ) .
4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 are heat- and acid-stable proteins whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation ( 5-8 ) .
Dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 interact with eIF4E , and these interactions result in the specific inhibition of cap-dependent translation , both in vivo and in vitro ( 5 , 8 ) .

We have also recently reported that expression of 4E-BP2 is down-regulated during human thymocyte maturation , and that may be a determinant in their different proliferation potential during maturation in response to activation ( 10 ) .
Our goal was to investigate translation rates of 4E-BPs function during differentiation of human myeloid cells .
Many of the myeloid cell lines can be induced to terminally differentiate along one or several pathways to mature into differentiated cells , and therefore , they provide a useful experimental model to study the expression of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 during monocytopoiesis and gran-ulopoiesis ( 11 ) .
In particular , the HL-60 cell line has been of interest because of its ability to undergo both granulocytic maturation and monocyte/macrophage differentiation following exposure to various agents .
The monoblastic U-937 cells have a clear monocytic lineage derivation and are a widely used model for monocytic differentiation .
Materials and Methods Chemicals and reagents Human IFN-y was a gift from Roussel-Uclaf ( Romainville , France ) , PMA was from Sigma ( St. Quentin-Fallavier , France ) , all-trans RA was kindly provided by Hoffman-La Roche ( Basel , Switzerland ) , and DMSO was from Merck ( Nogent sur Marne , France ) .
PMA and RA were dissolved in absolute ethanol at an initial concentration of 1 mg/ml and 10~ M , respec-tively .
Dilutions were performed in RPMI 1640 medium .
The final concentration of ethanol had no effect on cell growth and differentiation .
Cell and culture conditions The human myeloid cell lines HL-60 and U-937 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) .
The cells were grown in the presence of 5 % heat-inactivated FCS ( Life Technologies , Sarl , France ) , using RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine , 10 mM HEPES buffer , and gentamicin ( 20 pg/ml ) .
The cultures were incubated in humidified air with 5 % CO , at 37°C and subcultivated twice per week .
Abbreviation used in this paper : RA , retinoic acid .

HL-60 cells and U-937 cells ( 2 X 10° cells/ml ) were induced to differentiate for 1 to 5 days , by treatment with 5 ng/ml PMA , 200 U/ml IFN-y , 1 M all-trans RA , or 1 % DMSO , without any change of media .
Differentiation was monitored after 3 and 5 days by determining cell growth with a Coulter ( Margency , France ) counter ZM equipped with a Coultronic 256 channelizer , and viability was estimated by trypan blue dye exclusion .
Cell morphology was examined by staining of cytocentrifuged cells with May-Griinwald and subsequent light-micro-scope examination .
Cell surface Ag analysis The appearance of various cellular markers normally associated with the maturation of the granulocytic and monocytic elements was also deter-mined .
The analysis of cell surface Ag expression was performed by direct immunofluorescence using flow cytometry ( FACScan ; Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
Briefly , control and induced cells were collected , washed twice in PBS at 4°C , and incubated with 1 pg/ml monoclonal mouse anti-human FITC-conjugated anti-CD11b ( Mac-1 ; BEAR 1 ; mIgG1 ; Immunotech , Luminy , France ) and with 0.5 ug/ml monoclonal mouse anti-human FITC-conjugated anti-HLA-DR ( B8.12.2 , mIgG2b ; Im-munotech ) for 30 min at 4°C .
The cells were then washed twice with PBS containing 1 % BSA , 0,1 % sodium azide , fixed in 1 % paraformaldehyde , and analyzed for fluorescence .
Data analysis was based on examination of 5000 cells/sample .
The results are given as percent positive cells , and mean fluorescence intensity was obtained by subtracting the peak channel number of the negative control from the peak channel number of the corresponding experimental sample .
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed by successive freeze-thaw cycles , in 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , buffer containing 5 mM EDTA and 100 mM KCI .
The homogenate was centrifugated at 6000 X g for 10 min , and the supernatant was collected .
To analyze for 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 , 100 ug of protein was dissolved in Laeminli sample buffer ( 12 ) , and the samples were loaded onto a 15 % polyacrylamide gel .
Proteins were transferred onto a 0.22-um nitrocellulose membrane ( Schleicher & Schuell , Dassel , Germany ) , which was blocked in 5 % milk for 2 h , followed by incubation for 2 h with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against 4E-BP1 ( 11208 ) and 4E-BP2 ( 11211 ) in 10 mM Tris-HCI ] , pH 8 , buffer containing 150 mM NaCl at a dilution 1/1000 .
The membrane was then incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled conjugate Ab at a dilution 1/2000 .
Immunodetection was realized by enhanced chemoluminescence ( ECL ) reagents and autoradiography .
RNA extraction and Northern blot Total RNA was extracted by guanidium isothiocyanate lysis and CsCl cen-trifugation ( 13 ) and separated by electrophoresis through 1 % agarose , 6 % formaldehyde gels .
Twenty micrograms of denaturated total RNA were used for each lane .
After transfer onto nylon membrane , RNA blots were UV cross-linked ( UV Stratalinker , 120,000 uJ ; Stratagene , La Jolla CA ) , prehybridized in 50 % formamide , 5X SSPE , 1X Denhardt 's solution , and 0.5 % SDS for 24 h at 42°C , and then hybridized for 24 h at 42°C in the same solution containing 200 pg/ml of heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA and P-labeled cDNA probe ( adding approximatively 2 X 10° cpm of the labeled probe/m !
1 ) .
Following washes of increase stringency , membranes were analyzed with a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) and autoradiographed .
The blots were rehybridized with an actin probe to ensure that equal amounts of RNA were present in each lane .
Probes The 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 probes were a 0.8-kb human 4E-BP1 and a 3.5-kb human 4E-BP2 cDNA fragment .
The control probe was an actin probe made of a 2.1-kb human cDNA fragment .
For Northern blot analysis , cDNA inserts were purified and labeled with [ °°PJATP using a random primer kit ( Multiprime labeling kit ; Amersham , Orsay , France ) , according to the manufacter 's instructions .
Metabolic labeling Undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells were preincubated for 1 h in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium .
[ *°S ] Methionine ( 100 uCi ) was added for 4 h , and cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCI , pH 7.5 , buffer containing 5 mM EDTA and 100 mM KCI .
The radioactivity incorporated into TCA-precipitable material was measured .
REPRESSORS OF TRANSLATION AND MYELOID DIFFERENTIATION Results Assessment of HL-60 cell differentiation Differentiation of the promyelocytic HL-60 cells into monocytes/macrophages or into granulocytes can be induced in vitro by treating the cells with different agents , including IFN-y or PMA for monocytes/macrophages and RA or DMSO for granulocytes ( 14 ) .
We treated HL-60 cells with IFN-y , PMA , RA , or DMSO for 3 and 5 days and determined their differentiation stage by three criteria : cell proliferation , morphology , and cell surface expression of specific markers .
The cells were seeded at an initial density of 2 X 10°/ml and cultured in the presence of IFN-y ( 200 U/ml ) , PMA ( 5 ng/ml ) , RA ( 1 wM ) , or DMSO ( 1 % ) .
Following treatment with each agent , cell proliferation was strongly reduced at 3 and 5 days of culture , as shown in Fig .
1A .
The PMA-treated cells ceased to proliferate after 3 days .
The cells were more than 80 % viable at the end of the culture period , except for the PMA-treated cells , in which cell viability at 5 days was about 65 % .
Morphology of the cells was analyzed by the method of May-Griinwald staining ( Fig .
1B ) .
In untreated cells , cultured HL-60 cells are predominantly promy-elocytes with characteristic cytoplasmic granules , large nuclei , and prominent nucleoli .
HL-60 cells treated with either IFN-y or PMA for 3 days acquired monocyte/macrophage morphology , with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio , vacuolization , and blebbing , whereas HL-60 cells treated with RA or DMSO for 3 days acquired granulocyte morphology , with chromatin conden-sation , loss of nucleoli , and nuclear lobulation .
The PMA-treated cells became adherent to the substrate , with almost 100 % cell attachment observed by 48 h. Similar morphologies were observed after 5 days of treatment ( data not shown ) .
The differentiation of the cells was also determined by FACScan analysis of specific markers , CD11b and HLA-DR ( Table I ) .
The CD11b surface Ag is restricted to cells of the myelomonocytic lineage , and its expression is up-regulated during granulocytic and monocytic differentiation ( 15 ) .
The MHC class II determinant , HLA-DR , is expressed transiently during early development of myelomonocytic precursors and later in monocytes ( 11 ) .
In the absence of any stimuli , HL-60 cells express very low levels of the two Ags .
Exposure of the cells to the four inducers ( IFN-y , PMA , RA , and DMSO ) for 3 days results in an increase of CD11b surface Ag expression .
Upon differentiation of HL-60 cells by IFN-y or PMA treatment , the expression of HLA-DR was increased signif-icantly .
In contrast , the HLA-DR determinant was not induced upon treatment with RA or DMSO , consistent with the differentiation of these cells into granulocytes ( 11 ) .
Protein synthesis rates in undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells As protein synthesis rate is a major determinant of cell proliferation , we analyzed protein synthesis rates during differentiation of the HL-60 cells .
The translation rate was determined by metabolic labeling of cells with [ °°S ) Jmethionine , and incorporation rates were measured 3 and 5 days after stimulation .
Protein synthesis was strongly inhibited in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages after IFN-y and PMA treatments for 5 days ( 75 and 90 % inhibition , respectively ) ( Fig .
24 ) .
Slight inhibition of protein synthesis was observed with IFN-y after 3 days of culture , whereas maximal inhibition was already obtained after 3 days of treatment with PMA .
A similar strong inhibition of protein synthesis was observed when the cells were induced to differentiate into granulocytes in response to RA or DMSO for 5 days ( 85 % inhibition ) ( Fig .
2B ) .
Therefore , reduction of protein synthesis is a general mechanism , common to the two pathways of HL-60 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology A 130 `` E wo 201 0 X © a E 2 2 404 C o 3493 - # - Control -A- IFN-y -e- RA -o- _ DMSO -i- _ PMA FIGURE 1 .

It correlates well with the proliferation status of these cells during their differentiation , with a faster and stonger effect of PMA treatment as compared with IFN-y , RA , or DMSO treatments .
Expression of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 during differentiation of HL-60 cells along the monocytic/macrophage pathway To study the mechanisms by which IFN-y and PMA inhibit protein synthesis and induce monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells , the effect of these agents on 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 expression was ex-amined .
Three isoforms of 4E-BP1 ( indicated by the arrows ; Fig .
3 ) were detected following immunoblotting of extracts from un- treated HL-60 cells .
We previously reported that these isoforms represent various phosphorylation states of 4E-BP1 , the fastest migrating electrophoretic isoform corresponding to the unphosphor-ylated 4E-BP1 ( 5 , 6 , 8 ) .
Both IFN-y and PMA induced a dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 .
Whereas slight dephosphorylation of 4E-BPI was observed after 3 days of IFN-y or PMA treatments , complete dephosphorylation was obtained after 5 days .
No significant modification was observed in 46-BP2 expression during the treatment of the cells by both inducers .
Thus , during differentiation of HL-60 cells into monocytes/mac-rophages , dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 may be responsible for the inhibition of protein synthesis observed .

Expression of 4E-BP proteins during monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells .
HL-60 cells were seeded at an initial density of 2 X 10° cells/ml without ( C ) or with 200 U/ml of IFN-y or 5 ng/ml of PMA .
At 3 and 5 days of culture ( d3 and d5 ) , cells were lysed , and total protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting , using rabbit anti-4E-BP1 ( 1:1000 ) , rabbit anti-4E-BP2 ( 1:1000 ) Abs , followed by monoclonal anti-actin .
during monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells , no variation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation occurred after exposure to RA and DMSO for 3 and 5 days , but 4E-BP1 protein expression was reduced significantly by two- to threefold after 3 days of treatment ( Fig .
4A ) .
Furthermore , 4E-BP2 protein expression was strongly induced ( five- to sixfold ) after 3 days of treatment with both agents .
Because strong variations of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 protein expression were already observed after 3 days of treatment , we performed a kinetic of RA and DMSO treatment from 4 h to 3 days .
Maximal induction of 4E-BP2 protein expression was observed after 2 days of RA ( Fig .

A decrease in 4E-BP1 protein expression was observed after 3 days of treatment with both agents ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , we performed Northern blotting analysis to examine 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 mRNA expression during differentiation of the HL-60 cells .

o Thus , leading to a general inhibition of protein synthesis , but different terminal differentiation stages , IFN-y or PMA and RA or DMSO regulate 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 functions differently .
During differentiation of HL-60 cells along the granulocytic pathway , expression of 4E-BP2 protein is strongly increased with no modification of its mRNA level , whereas expression of 4E-BP1 protein and mRNA is decreased .
These results also suggest that the regulation of 4E-BP1 expression is controlled primarily at a transcrip-tional level , whereas 4E-BP2 expression is regulated at a posttranscriptional level .
Assessment of U-937 cell differentiation To confirm that the regulation of 4E-BP and 4E-BP2 expression observed during differentiation of HL-60 cells is specific to the differentiation pathway and not to the particular inducers or cells used in our experiments , we analyzed the expression of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 during differentiation of U-937 cells .
The monoblastic U-937 cells are arrested in an advanced stage of differentiation , and therefore , treatment of these cells with any of the four induc-ers , IFN-y , PMA , RA , or DMSO , carries their differentiation into monocytes/macrophages ( 17 , 18 ) .
We treated the U-937 cells for 3 and 5 days with IFN-y , PMA , or RA , and monitored their differentiation stage by the same three criteria as used for HL-60 cells : 4E-BP1 - > -- % 4E-BP2 | | Actin | < < -- _ ra » _ apo » _ Gp » | C d3 dS d3 dS d3 dS RA IFN-y PMA FIGURE 8 .

The different treatments resulted in the induction of U-937 cell differentiation toward a more mature state with major characteristic of monocytes/macrophages : large cytoplasms with vacuolizations , particularly in the PMA-induced cells , nuclear chromatin not condensed , and persistence of nucleoli .
Similar morphologies were observed after 5 days of treatment ( data not shown ) .
The differentiation of the cells was also controlled by FACScan analysis of specific marquers , CD11b and HLA-DR ( Table ID ) .
Differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by RA , IFN-y , and PMA results in an increase of the two surface Ag expression , consistent with the differentiation of the cells into monocytes/macrophages ( 19 ) .
Protein synthesis rates in undifferentiated and differentiated U-937 cells We analyzed protein synthesis rates during differentiation of the U-937 cells by metabolic labeling of cells with and incorporation rates were measured 3 and 5 days after stimulation .
Protein synthesis was strongly inhibited in U-937 cells induced to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages after IFN-y and PMA treatments for 5 days ( 75 and 90 % inhibition , respectively ) ( Fig .
7 ) .
A lesser extent of inhibition was obtained following RA treatment for 5 days ( 35 % inhibition ) .
Slight inhibition of protein synthesis was observed with IFN-y and RA after 3 days of culture , whereas inhibition was already very strong after 3 days of treatment with PMA .
4E-BPI1 and 4E-BP2 expression during differentiation of U-937 cells We analyzed 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 proteins by Western blotting during U-937 cell differentiation induced by IFN-y , PMA , or RA .
As in HL-60 cells , three isoforms of 4E-BP1 ( indicated by the arrows ; Fig .
8 ) were detected following immunoblotting of extracts from untreated U-937 cells .
RA as well as IFN-y and PMA induced a dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 .
The dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was strong after 3 days and complete after 5 days .
4E-BP2 expression is low in U-937 cells , and no increase , but rather a slight decrease , was observed during the treatment of the cells by the three inducers .
6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology Therefore , dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is a mechanism specific to the monocytic/macrophage differentiation pathway and not specific to the inducers used , whereas increase in 4E-BP2 protein expression is a mechanism specific to the granulocytic differentiation pathway and not specific to the inducers used .
Discussion There is considerable flexibility in the myeloid differentiation pro-gram , and the biological functions of the cells comprising mono-nuclear phagocytes depend on the successful completion of the differentiation pathway from immature precursor cells to the mature macrophage .
Control of gene expression can result in expression of specific cell functions .
Our results show that expression of the translation inhibitor 4E-BP1 is specific to monocytes/macro-phages .
Dephosphorylation of 4E-BPI1 occurs during the process of differentiation , suggesting a concomitant increase in its activity .
In contrast , expression of 4E-BP1 is down-regulated in granulo-cytes , and expression of 4E-BP2 is strongly increased during differentiation of cells along the granulocytic pathway .
These regulations may be responsible at least in part for the reduction of protein synthesis we observed during differentiation of the myeloid cells .
This reduction of protein synthesis correlates well with the well-known inhibition of cell proliferation during the differentiation process .
More interestingly , our results show that inhibition of translation occurs through different events during monocytic/macrophage differentiation pathway or during the granulocytic pathway .
This suggests that in addition to a general inhibition of protein synthesis , expression of 4E-BP1 or 4E-BP2 could confer different translational regulation of gene expression leading to these two differentiation pathways .
It would be of great interest to determine the existence of specific genes whose translation may be regulated specifically or predominantly by 4E-BP1 or by 4E-BP2 .
In this regard , it has to be considered that nondividing mature macrophages become good translators of specific mRNAs such as cytokines .
Our results would therefore suggest that translation of these particular cytokines may implicate a different mechanism , potentially independent on 4E-BP functions .
These hypotheses are currently under investigation .
Previous studies have suggested that 4E-BP1 is a major target of mitogen-activated protein kinases ( 6 ) .
However , it has also been reported that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is not necessary to induce 4E-BP1 phosphorylation ( 20-23 ) , and we have shown that dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 occurs following rapamycin treatment of cells ( 8 ) , indicating that phosphorylation of 4E-BPI1 is mediated by mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin , also called FRAP or RAFT1 ) , a member of the family of phos-phoinositide 3-kinase-related kinases ( reviewed in Ref .
24 ) .
Despite the fact that dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 induced by IFN-y is slow , the involvement of mTOR in IFN-y signaling should be investigated .
Up-regulation of 4E-BP2 during granulocyte differentiation is of particular interest , as it occurs after 2 days of treatment , preceding the morphology changes of the cells .
Furthermore , we did not observe an increase in 4E-BP2 protein expression in cellular clones resistant to the granulocytic differentiation induced by RA ( A.G. and L.B .
, personnal observations ) .
The up-regulation of 4E-BP2 protein is not due to a RA-response element in the promoter of the 4E-BP2 gene , as no induction of 4E-BP2 mRNA was observed , suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation of the gene .
Because the effect of RA on differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic cells is now used clinically in the therapy of these leukemias ( 25 , 26 ) , it would be of great interest to analyze expression of 4E-BP2 in 3497 leukemias and to investigate the consequence of modifying 4E-BP2 gene expression in these tumor cells .
