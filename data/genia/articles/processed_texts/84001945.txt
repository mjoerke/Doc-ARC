ABSTRACT Lymphoid cells contain specific receptors for glucocorticoids .
We have used [ °H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate to label covalently glucocorticoid receptors in rat thymic lymphocytes and in neoplastic cells obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma .
The covalently labeled glucocorticoid receptors were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( in the presence of 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ) .
In cytosolic fractions prepared from rat thymic lymphocytes , [ °H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate labels a protein ( M , =95,000 ) which was identified as the glucocorticoid receptor by the following criteria : ( a ) labeling of this moiety is inhibited by treatment with a 100-fold molar excess of glucocorticoids , such as dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide ; and ( b ) the covalently labeled M , 295,000 protein is activated ( by heating at 20° for 30 min ) to a form that binds to DNA-cellulose .
When intact thymocytes are treated with [ °H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate , an M , =95,000 moiety is also labeled covalently .
Approximately 35 % of the glucocorticoid receptors can be labeled covalently when intact thymocytes are treated with 100 nm [ °H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate for 30 min at 4° .
Neoplastic cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma were treated with [ °H ] dexamethasone-21-me-sylate .
In all samples , an M , =95,000 moiety was labeled cova-lently ; labeling was inhibited by excess glucocorticoid .
Smaller moieties were also identified by competition experiments ; these may represent proteolytic fragments of the M , =95,000 receptor .
Thus , in rat and human lymphoid cells , [ °H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate can be used to label covalently the glucocorticoid receptor .
INTRODUCTION Glucocorticoids are used widely in the treatment of lymphoid cancers , such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphocytic lymphoma .
The therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids may involve specific glucocorticoid receptors found in lymphoid cells ( 5 , 10 , 16 ) .
However , not all lymphoid cancers are responsive to glucocorticoids ( 3 , 8 ) .
Defects of glucocorticoid receptors in different malignant cell types may be responsible for the variation in sensitivity of leukemia and lymphoma to glucocorticoid ther-apy .
Such defects have been described in murine and human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines ( 14 , 16 , 22 ) and have been suggested recently in human leukemia ( 1 , 11 ) .
Until recently , glucocorticoid receptors in lymphoid cells have * This work was supported in part by the NIH Grant CA 26273 , American Cancer Society Grant CH-167 , and the Coleman Leukemia Research Fund .

In order to study receptor differences in leukemic cells , it would be beneficial to use a receptor label which remains stable under analytical conditions .
Affinity labeling has been used to label covalently glucocorticoid receptors in rat liver ( 7 ) , rat HTC® cells ( 20 , 21 ) , and mouse lymphoma ( 13 ) .
In the present study , we have used [ °HJDM to label covalently the glucocorticoid receptor in rat thymocytes .

RESULTS Affinity Labeling of Rat Thymocyte Glucocorticoid Receptors in Cytosolic Preparations .
DM has been used previously to label covalently glucocorticoid receptors in HTC cell cytosol ( 20 , 21 ) and in rat liver cytosol ( 7 ) , presumably through reaction with thiol anions of cysteine residues present in the steroid binding sites of the glucocorticoid receptor ( 18 ) .
Although [ °H ] DM reacts covalently with many proteins in crude cytosol , covalent binding between [ °HJDM and the glucocorticoid receptor can be inhibited selectivity by unlabeled glucocorticoid , such as TA or dexamethasone ( 19 ) .
[ °HJDM binding to other cytosolic proteins ( e.g .
, albumin ) is not inhibited competitively by excess glucocorticoid ( 20 ) .
Previous work with rat liver has shown that small-molecular-weight compounds present in crude cytosol prevent [ °HJDM binding to the glucocorticoid receptor ( 7 ) .
In order to determine whether DM labels glucocorticoid receptor in rat thymocytes , crude cytosol was incubated with 25 nm [ °HJTA and increasing concentrations of DM ( Chart 1 ) .
DM ( 200 nm ) inhibited effectively [ PH ] JTA binding to the receptor .
If thymocyte preparations were contaminated with RBCs ( known to contain high levels of gluta-thione ) , such competition was not observed .
In such prepara-tions , gel filtration could be used to remove low-molecular-weight moieties that interfered with receptor labeling ( data not shown ) .
Cytosolic fractions were treated with 200 nm [ °HJDM , alone or in combination with a 100-fold molar excess of TA , for 2 hr at 4° and analyzed by SDS : PAGE ( Chart 2 ) .
Several °H-labeted proteins were detected in sliced gels , but labeling of only one major protein band ( M , =95,000 ) was inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of TA .
Smaller proteins , also inhibited by excess unlabeled TA , were not detected when other techniques were used to label rat thymocytes ( see below ) .
The saturability of the M , 295,000 moiety provides evidence that this protein is the specific glucocorticoid receptor in rat thymocyte cytosol .
The [ °HJDM-labeled glucocorticoid receptor in both rat liver and HTC cells has been identified by its ability to undergo 5274 13H1 dpm x 10 4 1 1 1 L_ L 200 400 600 800 1000 DEXAMETHASONE 21-MESYLATE ( nM ) Chart 1 .
Competition of DM with [ °H ] JTA for binding to the glucocorticoid receptor .
Thymocyte cytosol was treated for 2 hr at 4° with 25 nm [ °H ] JTA plus the indicated concentration of DM .
Macromolecular-bound [ °HJTA was determined by a hydroxylapatite adsorption assay .
Samples ( 100 41 ) were incubated for 20 min wuth400ulofa50 % slunyofhydroxylapaﬂteinTEGbufferoontanngSOmuNaCl and 20 mm sodium molybdate .
The hydroxylapatite was washed 3 times by centrifugation in 3 ml of buffer , and radioactivity bound to the pellet was determined .

Thymocytes were treated at 4° with 200 nm [ °HJDM alone or in combination with a 100-fold molar excess of TA .
At 4° , nuclear translocation of the steroid : receptor complex has been shown to be minimal ( 2 ) .
Cytosolic fractions were prepared and analyzed by SDS : PAGE ( Chart 4 ) .
There was less nonspecific protein labeling than found in crude cytosol .
Further , specific [ °HJDM labeling was virtually confined to the M , =95,000 moiety .
The effects of concentration of [ °HJDM and of time of treatment on receptor binding were assessed ( Chart 5 ) .
Receptor labeling was detectable at 10 min and was maximal after 30 min ; 100 nm [ °HJDM was sufficient to label the receptor maximally .
The labeling efficiency of [ °HJDM was determined by labeling rat thy NOVEMBER 1983 Rat and Human Lymphoid Glucocorticoid Receptors mocyte suspensions for 1 hr at 4° with 100 nm [ °HJDM or 50 nm [ PH ] TA + a 100-fold excess of TA .
Specific labeling determined directly from [ °H ] TA-treated cytosol was 14,800 + 300 dpm .
Specific labeling from SDS : PAGE-analyzed [ °HJDM-treated cytosol was 5,300 + 500 cpm .
Therefore , [ °HJDM labeling of the glucocorticoid receptor was 35 % of that found for [ °H ] JTA .

All samples were analyzed by SDS : PAGE ( Chart 6 ) .
In all cases , saturable labeling was shown for a M , = 95,000 protein moiety .
Saturable labeling was also seen in a M , = 45,000 protein moiety in Patient A ; M , = 53,000 and M , = 35,000 in Patient B ; M , = 75,000 , M , = 57,000 , M , = 45,000 , and M , = 31,000 in Patient D ; and M , = 75,000 in Patient E. No additional saturable protein moieties were seen in Patient C. DISCUSSION This study represents the first application of affinity labeling to the analysis of glucocorticoid receptors in human leukemia and malignant lymphoma .
When malignant cells obtained from lymph node biopsy or from peripheral blood are treated with [ °HJDM , labeled receptor can be analyzed under denaturing conditions .

thymocyte .
Saturability with excess unlabeled steroid ( such as TA ) and ability to undergo activation and bind to DNA-celluiose ( properties of noncovalently radiolabeled lymphoid glucocorticoid receptor ) are retained by rat thymocyte receptor which has been labeled covalently with [ °HJDM .
These findings are in agreement with those of Simons and coworkers ( 7 , 19 ) and Milgrom ( 12 ) , who have demonstrated similar properties in rat liver cytosol and in rat HTC cells .
Rat thymocyte glucocorticoid receptor has M , = 95,000 as determined by SDS : PAGE .
This is consistent with previous reports of molecular weight of the glucocorticoid receptor in rat liver and in rat HTC cells ( 7 , 19 ) .
This moiety represents the reduced denatured fundamental unit of the glucocorticoid receptor .
Under nondenaturing conditions , the glucocorticoid receptor is apparently much larger and may consist of a multimer of receptor subunits or a complex with other nonreceptor proteins ( 15 , 17 , 23 ) .
In human malignant lymphoid cells , an M , 295,000 moiety is labeled covalently with [ °HJDM , and labeling is inhibited by excess TA .
The limited quantities of patient material have not permitted analysis of the M , =95,000 moiety by activation and binding to DNA-cellulose .
Four of the 5 human neoplastic cell samples show saturable bindings of smaller labeled moieties ( M , = 75,000 , M , = 57,000 , M , = 45,000 , M , = 35,000 , and M , = 31,000 ) .
These moieties may represent proteolytic fragments of the M , =95,000 receptor subunit .
The glucocorticoid receptor is unstable in some human leukemic cell extracts ( 6 ) and may be subjected to proteolysis during the limited exposure to cell-free conditions in our present assay .
When the covalently labeled rat liver receptor is treated with exogenous proteases such as trypsin , multiple smaller labeled forms are produced .
* Alterna-tively , these smaller moieties may be present in the intact cell and could be produced by processes that do not involve proteolysis ( e.g .
, mRNA processing to smaller species that encode only a portion of the M , = 95,000 subunit ) .
Covalent labeling of the glucocorticoid receptor in lymphoid cells may be performed in intact cells or cell extracts .
However , fewer proteins are nonsaturably labeled in intact thymocytes than in cell extracts , and specifically labeled proteins with molecular weight less than =95,000 are present in cell extracts which are not present when intact cells are labeled ( Charts 2 and 4 ) .
These initial studies demonstrate that glucocorticoid receptors in intact human malignant cells can be labeled covalently .
The methods in the current study ( rapid denaturing of cytosolic proteins with SDS ) appear suitable for protection of thymocyte and some human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptors from proteases but may not provide sufficiently rapid denaturation of all human lymphoid cells .
We are currently evaluating techniques to denature cells directly in an effort to minimize formation of smaller labeled proteins .
Further , it will be of interest to evaluate cytosols of malignant ceils to identify factors that either promote or protect against formation of receptor fragments .
