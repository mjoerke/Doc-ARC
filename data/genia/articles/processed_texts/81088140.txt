J. E ] ABSTRACT We have explored the possibility of using antibodies against purified rat liver glucocorticoid receptors to study the immunochemical properties of glucocorticoid receptors from murine and human malignant lymphocytes .
For this purpose , purified immune immunoglobulin G was covalently linked to Sepharose CL-4B .
We then examined the ability of the affinity gel to recognize cytosolic [ °HJtriamcinolone acetonide-receptor complexes from the corticoid-sensitive ( CS ) and -resistant strains of mouse lymphoma P1798 , from CS lymphocytes of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia , and from a CS clone of human leukemic lymphoblasts in tissue culture ( CH6 ) .
Mouse thymus was used as a source of glucocorticoid receptor from normal CS lymphocytes .
Whereas the immunoaffinity column retained 70 to 84 % of the 58- to 62-A ( Stokes radius ) [ PHItriamcino-lone acetonide-receptor complexes characteristic of the CS mouse and human lymphocytes , it failed to recognize the 27-to 28-A ( Stokes radius ) glucocorticoid receptor present in corticoid-resistant mouse lymphoma P1798 cells .
Therefore , under appropriate experimental conditions , it was possible to demonstrate cross-reactivity between the antiserum against rat liver glucocorticoid receptor and the 58- to 62-A ( Stokes radius ) glucocorticoid receptor from species as diverse as mouse and humans .
INTRODUCTION One of the key steps in the action of glucocorticoids and other steroids on target tissues appears to be binding of the hormone to specific intracellular receptor proteins ( 1 , 8 , 9 , 12 , 19 ) .
The physicochemical properties of these receptors have been intensively investigated with classic techniques of protein biochemistry such as density gradient centrifugation , gel filtra-tion , ion-exchange chromatography , polyacrylamide gel elec-trophoresis , and isoelectric focusing ( 15 , 22 ) .
In particular , purified rat liver glucocorticoid receptor is a highly asymmetrical M.W .

134 P1798 tumor lymphocytes were very similar to those of rat liver receptor .
In contrast , the CR strain of mouse lymphoma P1798 contained receptors that were much smaller ( M.W .
40,000 ; R , , 27 to 28 A ; * sedimentation coefficient , 3.38 ) and less asymmetrical than the receptors present in the CS P1798 lymphocytes .
In addition , the large CS P1798 glucocorticoid-receptor complexes bound less tightly to nuclei ( 20 ) and DNA-cellulose ( 18 ) than the smaller CR complexes , as judged by their extract-ability with monovalent , divalent , or trivalent cations .
Govindan ( 4 ) and Eisen ( 2 ) developed specific antisera against glucocorticoid receptor .
The antibody described by Eisen did not cross-react with rat serum cortisol-binding glob-ulin , rat liver glucocorticoid binder IB ( 10 ) , or rat liver estrogen-binding protein .
We now report that this antibody recognizes the 59- to 62-A ( R , ) CS mouse lymphoma P1798 glucocorticoid-receptor complex but fails to recognize the 27- to 28-A ( R , ) CR P1798 receptor .
In addition , we show that the antibody is capable of binding the 58- to 59-A ( R , ) glucocorticoid receptor from normal mouse thymus as well as the 59- to 62-A ( R , ) glucocorticoid receptor present in CS human acute and chronic leukemic lymphocytes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of Hormone-Receptor Complexes .
Cell suspensions were prepared from the CS and CR strains of mouse lymphoma P1798 and from normal female BALB/c mouse thymus as described previously ( 20 ) .
Lymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of a male and female patient with untreated CLL as reported earlier ( 21 ) .
CH6 is a CS clone that we isolated from the acute lymphoblastic leukemic cell line , CCRF-CEM ( American Type Culture Collection , Bethesda , Md . )
, by the limiting dilution technique .
Its growth is inhibited by 0.1 to 1 um TA in a manner that resembles clone C7 of Norman and Thompson ( 11 ) and Harmon et al .
( 7 ) .
The properties of CHG will be described in detail elsewhere .
Cells were homogenized in a 4° cold room with 10 strokes of a motor-driven glass-Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in 3 ( thymus , CLL ) or 5 to 6 ( P1798 , CHG ) volumes of 10 mm TES:4 mm EDTA : 10 mm DTT , pH 7.5 , at 4° , containing 50 nm ( °HJTA ( 31.3 Ci/mmol ; New England Nuclear , Boston , Mass . )
alone or 50 nm [ °HJTA pilus 5 um nonradioactive TA .
The homogenizer was constantly immersed in an ice water bath , and 10-sec intervals were allowed between strokes to ensure rigorous temperature control .
Cytosol was obtained by spinning the * The previously reported value of 29 to 30 A was calculated by assigning a R , of 30.5 A to the ovalbumin standard .
However , Sherman et al .
( 16 ) reported recently that 28.6 A was a more accurate value for ovalbumin , and we have revised the R , of the CR P1798 glucocorticoid receptor accordingly .

homogenate for 15 min at 27,000 x g and recentrifuging the 27,000 x g supernatant for 30 min at 100,000 x g. After 3 hr of incubation ( from the time of homogenization ) at 4° , free steroid was adsorbed with activated charcoal ( 13 ) .
Specific binding was calculated as the difference , after charcoal treat-ment , between dpm/mg protein in cytosol incubated with [ °HJTA alone and dpm/mg protein in cytosol incubated with radioactive plus nonradioactive steroid .
Nonspecific binding was 2 to 10 % of the total binding level in the various cytosols .
Therefore , cytosols incubated with excess nonradioactive steroid were not further analyzed .
Protein was measured with Coomassie blue according to the method of Sedmak and Grossberg ( 14 ) .
DTT does not interfere with this assay .
Immunoaffinity Chromatography .
Antibody against purified rat liver [ °HJTA-receptor complex was raised , purified , and coupled to Sepharose CL-4B ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Inc. , Piscataway , N .
J . )
as described previously ( 2 ) .
The immune 1gG-Sepharose was equilibrated with 10 mm TES:4 mm EDTA : 0.5 m NaCl : 10 % ( v/v ) glycerol and packed into a 1- x 4-cm column .
A column of identical dimensions was prepared with Sepharose CL-4B to which IgG from a nonimmunized rabbit had been covalently attached .
Immediately before use , the columns were equilibrated with 10 mm TES:4 mm EDTA : O.5 m NaCI:10 % ( v/v ) glycerol plus 0.5 mm DTT .
Cytosols were adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl by the addition of 0.25 volume of the same buffer containing 2.5 m NaCl .
Samples ( 0.5 ml ) were applied to the column by gravity flow .
The column was washed with 7 to 10 ml of the equilibrating buffer and then eluted with 10 ml of 0.1 m acetic acid .
This procedure , which removes all the adsorbed cytosolic proteins and radioactivity from the column , also denatures the receptor and causes complete dissociation of the radioactive ligand .
The column was returned to pH 7.5 by washing with 10 mm TES:4 mm EDTA : O.5 m NaC ) : 10 % ( v/v ) glycerol containing 0.1 m TES and then equilibrated with the same buffer containing the usual concentration ( 10 mm ) of TES .
Two experiments were performed with each cytosol .
In one experiment , portions of the same cytosol were run in parallel on the `` immune `` and ' `` nonimmune `` column to correct for small amounts of [ °HJTA bound to the latter .
To verify that hormone-receptor complexes were not cleaved during preparation of the cytosol , an additional portion in each experiment was analyzed by agarose get filtration [ Bio-Gel A-1.5m ( 100 to 200 mesh ) or Bio-Gel A-0.5m ( 100 to 200 mesh ) ; Bio-Rad Laboratories , Rockville Centre , N .
Y . ]
, using previously described methods ( 17 ) .
The pooled drop-through fractions from the nonimmune column were also subjected to agarose gel filtration .
Radioactivity was counted as described previously with 20 to 33 % efficiency ( 17 ) .
RESULTS Immunocaffinity Chromatography of Mouse Lymphoid Glucocorticoid-Receptor Complexes .
Chart 1 shows that 84 % of CS P1798 [ PHJTA-receptor complexes were retained by immune IgG-Sepharose .
In contrast , only 1 % of [ °HJTA complexes in another portion of the same cytosol were adsorbed to the nonimmune column .
Gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-1.5m showed that 85 % of the radioactivity in the pooled drop-through fractions of the nonimmune column was present as the typical 59-to 62-A ( R , ) CS P1798 [ °HJTA-receptor complex .
Therefore , JANUARY 1981 Immunochemical Studies of Glucocorticoid Receptors the inability of the nonimmune gel to retain bound [ °HIJTA was not due to dissociation or degradation of hormone-receptor complexes as they passed through the column .
This experiment also rules out nonspecific recognition of CS P1798 BH } TA complexes by normal rabbit IgG .
Chart 2 illustrates the striking ability of the immune IgG-Sepharose column to distinguish between 59- to 62-A ( R , ) CS P1798 and 27- to 28-A ( R , ) CR P1798 [ °H ] JTA-receptor complexes .
Whereas 78 % of CS complexes were adsorbed onto the immune column , only 1 % of CR complexes were retained by the affinity gel .
Over 85 % of the nonretained radioactivity in CR cytosol was recovered as the 27- to 28-A ( R , ) complex in the pooled drop-through fractions .
Therefore , the failure of immune 1IgG-Sepharose to recognize CR P1798 { °HJTA-receptor complexes was not attributable to dissociation of the ligand or cleavage of the receptor on the column .
In order to determine whether the immune gel could recognize glucocorticoid receptor from normal lymphocytes , we prepared [ °H ] JTA-labeled cytosol from mouse thymocytes and passed it through the immune and nonimmune columns .
We verified , by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-1.5m , that 80 % of bound [ °HJTA in the cytosol prior to immunoaffinity chromatography was in the form of a 58- to 59-A ( R , ) complex ( range of 2 experiments ) .
The remaining 20 % eluted as a 26-A peak .
As shown in Table 1 , 68 to 72 % of input [ °HJTA complexes were retained by the immune column , compared to only 1 % by the nonimmune column .
The Bio-Gel A-1.5m elution profile of the pooled drop-through fractions from the nonimmune column was practically identical to that of cytosol which had not been subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography .

arose cross-reacted with 67 to 69 % of [ °HJTA complexes in the cytosol of CHG lymphocytes , a CS clone of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in tissue culture , and with 70 % of cytosolic [ °HJTA complexes from freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes of 2 patients with CLL .
Lymphocytes from these 2 patients were glucocorticoid responsive as judged by TA suppression of uridine utilization in vitro ( 21 ) .
In all in-stances , we analyzed the pooled drop-through fractions of the nonimmune column by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-1.5m .
For CH6 , 64 % of the radioactivity was in the form of a 58-A ( R , ) complex and the remainder was free [ °H ] JTA .
In the case of CLL cytosol , 88 % of the [ °HIJTA was present in the 61-A ( R , ) peak .
The remaining radioactivity was free steroid .
None of the human cytosols contained appreciable amounts of 27- to 28-A ( R , ) material .
The reason for the greater instability of CH6 [ PHIJTA-receptor complexes remains the subject for future investiga-tion .
DISCUSSION The antiserum used in these experiments was produced in a rabbit that had been immunized with a highly purified preparation of rat liver [ °H ] JTA-receptor complex ( 2 ) .
The antigen was prepared by the 2-stage DNA-cellulose chromatography procedure of Eisen and Glinsmann ( 3 ) and was approximately 30 % pure .
Although this antiserum did not contain precipitating antibodies , IgG from the antiserum formed a soluble complex with the glucocorticoid receptor as determined by gel permea- 136 Table 1 Summary of immunoaffinity chromatography of mouse and human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptor complexes The amount of protein applied varied from 1.54 to 3.32 mg .

tion chromatography .
These complexes can be precipitated by staphylococcal protein A ( Pansorbin ; Calbiochem-Behring Corp. , La Jolla , Calif. ) and by goat antibody to rabbit IgG .
Since only limited quantities of high-titer antiserum were obtained from this rabbit , IgG was purified and covalently linked to Sepharose CL-4B .
The immobilized antibody can be regenerated and used for multiple analyses ( 2 ) .
Although the antigen was glucocorticoid receptor from rat liver , we examined the possibility that the immunoaffinity gel could be used to analyze glucocorticoid receptors from other species .
In the initial studies ( 2 ) , mouse liver receptor was found to cross-react with this antiserum .
However , only 10 to 20 % of an input `` load `` `` of 200 pmol of ( R , ) mouse liver [ °HJTA-receptor complexes was adsorbed by a column that retained over 200 pmol of 60-A rat liver glucocorticoid receptors .
These data suggested that the cross-reactivity was incom-plete .
In the current experiments , we have used small input loads of 1 to 2 pmol .
Under these conditions , 70 % of [ °HJTA-receptor complexes from normal mouse thymus and from human leukemic lymphocytes and 80 % of [ °HJTA-receptor complexes from CS mouse lymphoma P1798 cells were adsorbed by the immunoaffinity column .
When more antibody is produced , it will be important to define parameters such as antibody affinity and heterogeneity using standard equilibrium techniques for quantitating cross-reactivity .
It is not known whether the 58- to 62-A ( R , ) hormone-receptor complexes that did not bind to the immune column belong to a subpopulation with different im-munochemica !
properties from the majority of [ °HJTA complexes in a given cytosol preparation or failure of all the complexes to bind simply reflects an equilibrium process .
Eisen ( 2 ) had observed previously that 22 % of [ °HJTA complexes in rat liver cytosol were not adsorbed by immune IgG-Sepharose prepared with IgG from the same batch of antiserum used in the present experiments .
Govindan ( 4 ) reported 72 % retention of rat liver dexamethasone-binding activity on immune 1gG-Sepharose prepared with rabbit antibody against purified rat liver glucocorticoid receptor .

Greene et al .
( 5 ) demonstrated immunochemical similarity among estrogen receptors from 8 mammalian species , including those isolated from human tissue .
These authors also made the interesting observation that antibodies produced by a Lewis rat reacted only with calf uterus estrogen receptor , the protein against which they were raised ( 6 ) .
Our results suggest that rat liver glucocorticoid receptor and cytosolic lymphoid [ °H ] JTA-receptor complexes from species as diverse as mouse and humans may share antigenic determinants .
The antibody used in the work described here was raised against 60-A [ °HJTA-receptor complexes ( 2 ) .
All the [ °HITA complexes it recognized had a R , of 58 to 62 A .
Its failure to cross-react with the 27- to 28-A ( R , ) [ PHJTA complex present in CR P1798 mouse tumor lymphocytes suggests that the antibodies recognized the 62 - 27 A region of the receptor molecule , /.e .
, that portion of the 59- to 62-A ( R , ) glucocorticoid receptor from CS P1798 lymphocytes that can be selectively digested by chymotrypsin under appropriate in vitro conditions ( 18 ) .
Another explanation is that the 27- to 28-A ( R , ) fragment obtained by chymotrypsin digestion of the 59- to 62-A ( R , ) receptor is immunochemically different from the 27- to 28-A ( R , ) glucocorticoid receptor in undigested CR P1798 lympho-cyte cytosol .
It is also possible that both regions of the receptor molecule are required for antigenic recognition .
However , the antibody preparation described by Govindan reacted not only with intact ( M.W .
90,000 ) rat liver glucocorticoid-receptor complexes but also with a M.W .
45,000 cleavage product ( 4 ) .
So far , we have been unsuccessful in eluting native [ °HJTA-receptor complexes from the immunoaffinity column .
Once this problem is resolved , immunoaffinity chromatography will be a powerful tool for the purification of glucocorticoid receptors .
However , even at the current level of sophistication , the availability of antibodies that recognize glucocorticoid receptors will undoubtedly open up new areas of research on these important regulatory proteins .
