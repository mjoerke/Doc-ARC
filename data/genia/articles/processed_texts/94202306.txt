5 Encephalomyocarditis Virus Internal Ribosomal Entry Site RNA-Protein Interactions GARY W. WITHERELL* anp ECKARD WIMMER Department of Microbiology , State University of New York at Stony Brook , Stony Brook , New York 11794 Received 9 June 1993/Accepted 16 November 1993 Translational initiation of encephalomyocarditis virus ( EMCV ) mRNA occurs by ribosomal entry into the 5 ' nontranslated region of the EMCV mRNA , rather than by ribosomal scanning .
Internal ribosomal binding requires a cis-acting element termed the internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) .
IRES elements have been proposed to be involved in the translation of picornavirus mRNAs and some cellular mRNAs .
Internal ribosome binding likely requires the interaction of trans-acting factors that recognize both the mRNA and the ribosomal complex .
Five cellular proteins ( pS2 , p57 , p70 , p72 , and p100 ) cross-link the EMCV IRES or fragments of the IRES .
For one of these proteins , p57 , binding to the IRES correlates with translation .
Recently , p57 was identified to be very similar , if not identical , to polypyrimidine tract-binding protein .
On the basis of cross-linking results with 21 different EMCV IRES fragments and cytoplasmic HeLa extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate as the source of polypeptides , consensus binding sites for p52 , p57 , p70 , and p100 are proposed .
It is suggested that each of these proteins recognizes primarily a structural feature of the RNA rather than a specific sequence .
Encephalomyocarditis virus ( EMCV ) is a member of the genus Cardiovirus of the family Picornaviridae .
Like other picornaviruses , the 5 nontranslated region ( NTR ) of EMCV mRNA is unusually long , is uncapped , and contains several noninitiating AUG codons .
Translational initiation of EMCV mRNA occurs by a cap-independent mechanism , requiring approximately 600 nucleotides ( nt ) of the 830-nt-long 5 ' NTR ( 19 , 20 , 22 , 33 ) .
This 600-nt segment , which occurs approximately 260 nt downstream from the 5 ' end of the RNA , is termed the internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) .
Similar IRES-dependent translational initiation mechanisms are utilized by other picornavirus mRNAs , such as poliovirus ( 39 , 40 ) , foot-and-mouth disease virus ( 23 ) , and hepatitis A virus ( 5 ) .
The IRES element also occurs in the genome of an enveloped plus-strand RNA virus , hepatitis C virus ( 53 ) , and of a cellular mRNA , BiP ( 28 ) .
Picornavirus IRES elements can be divided into two types on the basis of their nucleotide sequences and proposed secondary structures ; type 1 belongs to the genera Enterovirus and Rhinovirus , and type 2 belongs to the genera Cardiovirus , Aphthovirus , and Hepatovirus of the Picornaviridae ( 5 , 9 , 21 , 26 , 42 , 43 ) .
Remarkably , the IRES elements of the two groups have little , if any , sequence or structural homology .
One common primary sequence element located at the 3 ' border of each IRES element , the Y , , -X , , , -AUG motif , with Y , corresponding to a pyrimidine tract of length n and X , , , corresponding to a random spacer sequence of length m , has been proposed to unify cap-independent translation among picornaviruses ( 21 , 44 ) .
Another possible unifying feature of IRES elements could be their interaction with specific proteins ( 7 ) .
Four cellular proteins ( p52 , p57 , p70 , and p100 ) which cross-link fragments of IRES elements have been observed .
A polypeptide with a molecular mass of 52 kDa has been found to bind the IRES of poliovirus ( 29 , 41 ) and of EMCV ( 4 , 22 ) .
pS2 has recently been identified to be La ( 30 ) , a nuclear protein that binds the 3 ' terminus of nascent RNA polymerase * Corresponding author .

Immunodepletion of cell extracts with La antibodies inhibits cap-independent translation , while the addition of La to rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( RRL ) corrects aberrant and enhances authentic translational initiation of poliovirus mRNA ( 30 ) .
Another protein , p57 , was found to bind the IRES elements of EMCV ( 4 , 22 ) , foot-and-mouth disease virus , ( 27 ) , and poliovirus ( 15a , 41 ) .
It has been proposed that p57 recognizes a linear nucleotide sequence within these IRES elements ( 4 , 27 ) .
Recently , p57 has been found to be very similar , if not identical , to polypyrimidine tract-binding protein ( pPTB ) ( 16 ) , a predominantly nuclear protein , also known as hnRNPI ( 12 ) , that is possibly involved in 3 ' splice site selection or RNA metabolism ( 11 , 13 , 35 , 38 ) .
Cap-independent translation is inhibited by the addition of pPTB antibodies to cell extracts but can not be restored by the addition of purified pPTB ( 16 ) .
This observation suggests that pPTB is associated with other factors required for translation ( 16 ) .
Additional studies indicate that purified pPTB recognizes RNA structural elements rather than specific sequences and that the binding specificity of pPTB is increased by the presence of factors within HeLa extract ( 57 ) .
Thus , the binding properties of pure pPTB/pS57 may not reflect the binding properties of pPTB/p57 within a ribonucleoprotein complex ( RNP ) .
We have therefore attempted to determine the binding specificity of pPTB/pS57 when presented to RNA within the context of a cellular extract .
Additional proteins have also been observed to cross-link fragments of various IRES elements ( 4 , 22 , 29 , 41 ) .
Two of these proteins , p70 and p100 , may associate with pPTB/p57 since pPTB antibodies immunoprecipitate not only p57 but also p70 and p100 ( 51a ) .
The addition of purified pPTB to HeLa extract has also been observed to enhance both p57 and p100 cross-linking ( 57 ) .
Furthermore , pPTB and a protein with a molecular mass of 97 kDa ( likely the same as p100 described here ) have been found to act synergistically to stimulate cap-independent translation directed by the rhinovirus IRES element ( 3a ) .
Interestingly , formation of a large RNP containing pPTB and a 100-kDa nuclear protein has been proposed to be required to restore splicing activity to pPTB-immunode- 3184 WITHERELL AND WIMMER pleted extracts ( 38 ) .
It is uncertain , however , whether the nuclear 100-kDa protein described by Patton et al .
( 38 ) and the cytoplasmic 100-kDa protein studied here are identical proteins .
In this paper p57 , p52 , p70 , and p100 are shown to bind specifically to multiple fragments of the EMCV IRES .
Consensus binding sites for each protein are proposed on the basis of cross-linking results with 21 different EMCV IRES fragments .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials .
Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized on an Apylied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer .
[ « - `` P ] JUTP , [ « - > P ] JCTP , and [ « - > P ] JATP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ) and *°S-dATP were purchased from Amersham .
RNase A , RNase T1 , and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase were obtained from Boehr-inger Mannheim .
T7 DNA polymerase ( Sequenase ) was purchased from United States Biochemical Corporation .
Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Perkin-Elmer Cetus .
RRL was purchased from Promega .
DNA restriction enzymes , T4 DNA ligase , T4 DNA polymerase , and DNA polymerase I large ( Klenow ) fragment were purchased from New England Biolabs .
Manufacturer 's protocols were followed for all reactions .
Construction of transcription templates .
Plasmids were constructed by introducing deletions or insertions into plasmid vectors pBS-ECAT ( 20 ) , pBS-ECAT393 ( 22 ) , and pBS-ECATA422 ( 22 ) to create transcription templates for RNA fragments 2 , 9 , 15 , 16 , and 21 .
Styl , EcoRI , and ApaLI restriction sites blunt ended with the polymerase activity of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and Apel restriction sites blunt ended with the 3'-to-5 ' exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase are designated ( blunt ) in the text below .
Plasmid pBS-ECAT was used to construct the template for fragment 2. pBS-ECAT was digested with Styl , blunt ended with Klenow fragment , and religated .
Apel ( blunt ) -Neol fragments of this construct were then ligated to an EcoRI ( blunt ) -NcoI fragment of pBS-ECAT to create the fragment 2 DNA template .
The plasmid template for fragment 9 was created by ligating StyI-Pstl and BstXI-Pstl fragments of pBS-ECAT393 with oligo-A ( described below ) digested with Styl and BstXI .
Oligo-A was amplified by PCR from pBS-ECAT with primers TAACCTAGGGGTCTTTCCCCTAGGAATGCAAGGTCT and GGATATATCAACGGTGG .
Mispriming resulted in the deletion of the sequence underlined .
Fragments of plasmid pBS-ECAT ( Apal-Ncol and EcoRI-Ncol digested ) were ligated to oligo-B ( described below ) digested with EcoRI and Apal to construct the plasmid template for fragment 15 and fragment 16 .
Oligo-B was PCR amplified from pBS-ECAT with primers CCCGAATTCGAGCTCTAACGTTACTGGC CG and ATTGGGCCCTCGGTGGAAAATACATATAG .
The plasmid template for fragment 21 was created by ligating together EcoRI ( blunt ) -Psfl and ApaLI ( blunt ) -Pstl fragments of pBS-ECAT .
Following complete digestion with restriction enzymes , DNA fragments were purified on low-melting-point agarose gels ( 49 ) and ligated with T4 DNA ligase .
Escherichia coli C600 was used as a host in each case ( 45 ) .
Transformants harboring plasmid DNA were screened by ampicillin resistance and restriction analysis of minilysate plasmid DNA ( 49 ) .
Plasmids were sequenced in the region of interest with T7 DNA polymerase by use of *°S-labeled dATP .
In vitro transcription reactions .
Oligoribonucleotides were prepared by in vitro transcription from synthetic DNA ( fragments 6 , 7 , 8 , 11 , and 12 ) , from PCR templates amplified with a 5 ' primer containing a T7 promoter ( fragments 3 , 4 , 5 , 17 , J. ViroL .
and 18 ) , or from restricted CsCl-purified ( 49 ) plasmid DNA ( fragments 1 , 2 , 9 , 10 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 19 , 20 , and 21 ) by procedures previously described ( 31 , 50 ) .
Restricted plasmid DNA constructs , described above , were used directly as templates for fragments 2 , 9 , 15 , 16 , and 21 .
Restricted plasmid pBS-ECAT ( 20 ) was used directly as a template for fragments 13 and 14 , restricted plasmid pBS-ECAT393 ( 22 ) was used directly as a template for fragments 1 and 10 , and restricted plasmid pBS-ECAT422 ( 22 ) was used directly as a template for fragments 19 and 20 .
RNAs were typically labeled by the addition of [ « -°°P ] UTP ( 5 pCi ) into the transcription reaction mixture .
Transcription reaction mixtures were purified with Stratagene NucTrap push columns , eluted with 5 mM HEPES ( N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic - acid ; pH 7.6 ) , 25 mM KCl , and 5 mM MgCl , , and stored at -20°C .
Preparation of HeLa extract .
A cytoplasmic extract of S3 HeLa suspension cells ( referred to as HeLa extract ) was prepared as described previously ( 34 ) except that dialysis and micrococcal nuclease steps were omitted .
HeLa extract was adjusted to 10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol and stored at -80°C .
Cross-linking assays .
UV light cross-linking assays were performed as described previously ( 22 ) .
*°P-labeled RNAs were incubated with either 50 ug of HeLa extract or 600 ug of rabbit reticulocyte lysate in 30 pl of cross-link buffer ( 5 mM HEPES [ pH 7.6 ] , 25 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl , , 3.8 % glycerol ) containing 1 pg of rRNA at 30°C for 20 min .
Reactions were cross-linked in a Stratagene Stratalinker 2400 UV Cross Linker at 4,000 W/cm `` for 40 min .
RNAs were digested by incubation with 20 pg of RNase A and 200 U of RNase T1 .
Cross-linked proteins were separated on 12.5 % sodium dode-cyl sulfate ( SDS ) -polyacrylamide gels by the buffer system of Laemmli ( 24 ) , as modified by Nicklin et al .
( 36 ) .
Gels were electrophoresed at 5 to 10 V/em at constant current ( 70 mA ) , dried , and autoradiographed .
The electrophoretic mobility and intensity of the cross-linking signal for each band were quan-titated by scanning densitometry .
Competition assays were used to ensure that the same set or subset of proteins were cross-linking each RNA .
Competition assays were performed as described above , except that labeled IRES fragments ( fragments 1 , 2 , 3 , 14 , 15 , 16 , and 21 ) were incubated with RRL in the presence of either 3 pg of unlabeled fragment 1 or 3 ug of unlabeled rRNA .
Fragment 1 was chosen as the unlabeled competitor since in the absence of rRNA it shows some affinity for all four cross-linkable RRL proteins , p52 , p57 , p70 , and p72 ( data not shown ) .
The addition of excess unlabeled fragment 1 was found to inhibit p52 , p57 , p70 , and p72 cross-linking to each labeled fragment tested , whereas the addition of the same amount of rRNA had little or no effect on cross-linking ( data not shown ) .
RNA folding .
Optimal and suboptimal foldings for RNA sequences were computed by use of the mfold package by Zuker and Jaeger ( see references 17 , 18 , and 62 ) .
The secondary structure illustrated was the thermodynamically most favored structure for all fragments except fragments 1 and 9 .
These two suboptimal foldings were chosen since they correspond most closely to the folding of the EMCV IRES .
Suboptimal foldings shown for fragments 1 and 9 are within 0.2 keal ( ca .
0.8 kJ ; 0.8 % ) and 0.1 keal ( ca .
0.4 kJ ; 0.6 % ) , respectively , of the most favored structure .
RESULTS Cross-linking of EMCV IRES to RRL and HeLa extracts .
The EMCV IRES used in this study contains the 580-nt 3'-terminal segment ( nt 260 to 840 ) of the 5° NTR of the EMCV genome ( Fig .
1A ) .

EMCV IRES sequence , predicted secondary structure , and relation of IRES fragments to the full-length IRES .
( A ) Primary and predicted secondary structure of the EMCV IRES ( 9 , 42 ) .
Stem-loop structures are sequentially named by letters according to Duke et al .
( 9 ) , and nucleotide positions on the EMCV genome are marked by numbers .
The initiating AUG start codon is boxed .
( B ) Linear representation of EMCV IRES and IRES fragments used for UV EMCV IRES RNA-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS 3185 840 ) is sufficient to promote internal ribosomal entry ( 22 ) , its translational efficiency in a dicistronic mRNA is reduced approximately fivefold , compared with the 580-nt fragment .
For this reason , we chose to use the 580-nt 5° NTR sequence that includes 24 nt of the 5 ' polypyrimidine tract and the authentic EMCV initiation codon .
A series of stem-loop structures , designated D to M , follow the 5 ' polypyrimidine tract ( note that we have changed our designation of the loops according to the proposal of Duke et al .
[ 9 ] ; for example , the E-loop is now referred to as the H-loop ) .
The full-length IRES and fragments of the IRES were synthesized and used for UV cross-linking experiments .
The relation of the IRES fragments to the full-length IRES is illustrated in Fig .
1B .
Sequences and possible secondary structures of IRES fragments ( see Materials and Methods ) are shown in Fig .
2 .
To analyze the binding of cellular proteins to the EMCV IRES , we prepared *°P-labeled RNAs and incubated them with either HeLa extract or RRL .
After the RNA-protein complexes were cross-linked with UV light , the RNAs were digested with nucleases and the labeled proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
The EMCV IRES was found to cross-link two proteins ( p52 and p57 ) with HeLa extract ( Fig .
3A , lane IRES ) and three proteins with RRL ( p52 , p57 , and p72 ) ( Fig .
3B , lane IRES ) .
Fragments of the IRES were synthesized ( Fig .
2 ) in an attempt to localize the binding site of these proteins .
Fragments contained sequences derived from either the D-loop ( fragments 14 and 16 ) , the DE-loops ( fragment 15 ) , the DEF-loops ( fragment 13 ) , the F-loop ( fragments 11 and 12 ) , the H-loop ( fragments 1-10 ) , the I-loop ( fragment 17 ) , the J-loop ( fragment 18 ) , the IJ-loops ( fragment 19 ) , the IJKLM-loops ( fragment 20 ) , or the KLM-loops ( fragment 21 ) .
Fragments 20 and 21 include the Y , , -X , , , -AUG motif , of which the AUG is the initiation codon of the EMCV polyprotein ( 21 ) .
Relative cross-linking intensities for these fragments are shown in Table 1 .
Cross-linking of the H-loop to HeLa extract and RRL proteins .
The H-loop , a term used for the H stem-loop structure shown in Fig .
1A , was of special interest to us since two point mutations in the stem adjacent to the loop abolish both IRES function and UV cross-linking of p57 ( 22 ) .
RNA fragments containing H-loop sequences are designated H-loop variants and contain extra 5 ' and 3 ' nucleotides because of T7 promoter restrictions and the application of runoff transcription reactions .
Results for UV cross-linking of HeLa extract and RRL proteins to various H-loop variants labeled with [ « - > P ] JUTP are shown in Table 1 and Fig .
3A and B ( lane numbers correspond to fragment numbers detailed in Fig .
1B and 2 ) .
p57 , the HeLa-specific p100 , and the RRL-specific p72 proteins cross-link well when fragment 1 is labeled with { a « - `` `` P ] JUTP , whereas a polypeptide migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 52 kDa cross-links only weakly ( Fig .
3A and B , lanes 1 , and Table 1 ) .
These results are in agreement with published data ( 22 ) .
In an attempt to localize the p57 and p52 cross-linking site ( s ) on the H-loop , fragment 1 was synthesized with either [ « - > P ] JUTP , { « -° `` P ] ATP , or [ « - > °P ] CTP as the source of the cross-linking studies .
Numbers above the IRES correspond to nucleotide positions on EMCV mRNA shown in panel A. IRES fragments are identified by number and positioned below the full-length IRES to show the relation of fragment sequences to the IRES sequence .
Regions of sequence difference between IRES fragments and the full-length IRES are indicated by asterisks , and deletions are indicated by lines .

UV cross-linking of RNA fragments derived from EMCV IRES .
Fragments were labeled with [ « -*°PJUTP and incubated with either 50 ug of HeLa extract ( A ) or 600 jg of RRL , in cross-link buffer ( pH 7.6 ) at 30°C for 20 min .
After incubation , the complexes were UV cross-linked and digested with ribonucieases , and the labeled proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels .
Lanes -HeLa and -RRL , no extract ; lane IRES , EMCV IRES from nt 260 to 837 ; lanes 1 to 21 , fragments 1 to 21 , respectively , as shown in Fig .
2 or described in the text ; lane M , protein markers of 92 kDa , 69 kDa , and 46 kDa .
Bands corresponding to p52 , p57 , p70 , and p100 are indicated .
throughout the RNA to be detected .
RNAs labeled with [ a- > °P ] ATP , however , are not labeled in the upper hairpin of the second stem-loop ( Fig .
4B ) , allowing only cross-linking sites in the first , third , and fourth stem-loops and the lower EMCV IRES RNA-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS 3187 stem of the second stem-loop to be detected .
From Fig .
4D , it is apparent that cross-linking of RRL to RNAs labeled with [ « -* > P ] JUTP ( lane 1 ) and [ « -P ] JCTP ( lane 3 ) results in transfer of label to p57 , whereas with [ a-P ] JATP-labeled RNA , p57 cross-linking is greatly reduced ( lane 2 ) .
If RNAse digestion was less than complete , then cross-linking to a site even several nucleotides away from one of the nineteen labeled adenosines should have been detected .
It is therefore possible that the cross-linking site for p57 in fragment 1 is located in the upper 5-bp hairpin of the second stem-loop .
Alternatively , other RNase digestion products of fragment 1 could exist , depending on the completeness of digestion , which could be cross-linked to p57 and labeled by [ « - `` `` P ] JUTP and but not by [ e-*°P ] JATP .
Cross-linking of p52 is weak but unaffected by the label used , showing that the inability to label p57 with [ e-*°P ] ATP is specific and not due to the particular preparation of RNA .
The difference in cross-linking intensities observed for fragment 1 , by simply changing the labeled nucleotide , illustrates the limitations of cross-linking assays .
Cross-linking assays do not directly measure binding affinity since the cross-linking signal is determined not only by the affinity of a protein for its binding target but also by the number of sites cross-linked , the location of the protein cross-linking site ( s ) relative to a labeled nucleotide , the number of labeled nucleotides protected against ribonuclease digestion by the cross-linked protein , and the particular amino acid that contacts the RNA ( since aromatic and heterocyclic amino acids , as well as cysteine , are especially photoreactive ) .
In a previous study , the cross-linking intensities and filter-binding affinities of IRES fragments to purified pPTB were found to generally correlate ( 57 ) , an observation suggesting that binding affinity has a strong influence on cross-linking intensity .
Several fragments , however , were found to cross-link more strongly or weakly than expected TABLE 1 .

on the basis of binding affinity alone ( 57 ) .
The limitations of cross-linking assays must therefore be considered when comparing cross-linking intensities of vastly different sequences .
Cross-linking of H-loop variants to HeLa extract and RRL proteins .
Cross-linking of p57 from HeLa extract and RRL to nine H-loop variants ( fragments 2 to 10 ) are shown in Fig .
3A and B and Table 1 .
The insertion of 18 nt into fragment 1 yielded fragment 2 ( see the asterisks of fragment 2 [ Fig .
2 ] ) and is expected to alter the secondary structure of the RNA , creating an internal loop and two additional base pairs in the upper stem of the second helix of fragment 1 ( Fig .
2 ) .
Cross-linking of p57 to fragment 2 was greatly reduced compared with fragment 1 .
Extending the second helix of fragment 1 and deleting the three adjacent stem structures , to produce fragment 3 , had no effect on cross-linking intensity of pS7 .
However , deletion of 17 nt from the 3 ' terminus of fragment 3 , eliminating the lower 14 bp of the stem ( fragment 4 ) , reduced p57 cross-linking .
Further 5 , 3 ' , and internal deletions of fragment 4 ( fragments 6 , 7 , and 8 ) resulted in RNAs unable to cross-link p57 .
These results suggest that sequences upstream and downstream of the upper 13 bp of the second stem-loop of fragment 1 contribute to p57 binding .
A 2-nt substitution in the upper stem of fragment 4 gave fragment 5 ( Fig .
2 ) and eliminated p57 cross-linking .
This 2-nt substitution disrupted J. Virou .
the upper hairpin and bulge of the second stem-loop of fragment 4 , suggesting that either the upper 5-bp stem , the 5-base loop , or the 8-base bulged loop is important for pS7 cross-linking .
Deleting the upper 5-bp stem-loop and eight extrahelical nucleotides of fragment 1 ( fragment 9 ) drastically altered the RNA structure , also eliminating p57 cross-linking .
Overall , these results suggest that cross-linking of p57 to the H-loop requires binding determinants ( which are not necessarily cross-linking sites ) in both the upper and lower stem regions of the second stem-loop in fragment 1 .
If the cross-linking site for p57 is located in the upper stem , as suggested by the alternative label experiments described above , then the lack of cross-linking to fragment 9 could be due either to elimination of the cross-linking site or to reduced binding affinity .
Since the proposed cross-linking site is present in fragments 6 , 7 , and 8 , the lack of cross-linking to these fragments is most likely due to the absence of necessary binding determinants , resulting in decreased binding affinity .
Surprisingly , deletion of 52 nt from the 3 ' end of fragment 1 ( fragment 10 ) resulted in a drastically altered RNA structure ( Fig .
2 ) that was still able to cross-link p57 , although with reduced intensity .
In general , p57 of HeLa and RRLs cross-link the H-loop variants with similar efficiencies .
All the H-loop variants except two were found to cross-link HeLa extract p52 with at least moderate affinity ( Fig .
3A and Table 1 ) .
The two fragments that cross-link p57 strongly ( fragments 1 and 3 ) are unable to cross-link p52 well ( Fig .
3A and 4D ) .
These results suggest that p52 and p57 , in the mixture of cytoplasmic proteins , compete for the same binding site in fragments 1 and 3 .
The smallest fragment that cross-links p52 is fragment 8 , a stem-loop structure with a 5-bp helix and a 5-base loop corresponding to the upper hairpin of the H-loop .
Thus , it is likely that pS2 and p57 compete for binding the upper hairpin of fragment 1 and fragment 3 , consistent with the proposal that the p57-cross-linking site , and therefore part of the p57-binding site , is in the upper hairpin of the second stem-loop of fragment 1 .
The weak cross-linking observed between pS2 and fragment 1 ( Fig .
4D ) , including [ « - `` P ] JATP-labeled fragment 1 in which the upper hairpin is not labeled ( Fig .
4B ) , may be due to nonspecific p52 binding .
p52 from RRL cross-linked H-loop variants with a specificity similar to p52 from HeLa extract , but with reduced intensity ( Fig .
3B and Table 1 ) .
An RRL-specific protein with a molecular mass of 72 kDa was found to cross-link the EMCV IRES and IRES fragments 1 and 3 ( Fig .
3B , lanes 1 and 3 , and Table 1 ) , with weaker cross-linking to fragment 10 ( Figure 3B , lane 10 , and Table 1 ) .
The cross-linking specificity of p72 thus correlates with p57 cross-linking in RRL .
A band with a slightly faster migration than p72 , corresponding to a 70-kDa polypeptide , was observed with RRL and HeLa extract to cross-link fragment 2 ( Fig .
3A and B , lanes 2 , and Table 1 ) .
Weak cross-linking to fragment 9 was also detected ( Fig .
3A and B , lanes 9 , and Table 1 ) .
Several H-loop variants specifically cross-link a 100-kDa protein found in HeLa extract , but not in RRL ( Fig .
3A and B and Table 1 ) .
Jackson and coworkers ( see reference 3a ) have identified a 97-kDa protein ( p97 ) present in HeLa extract , but not in RRL , which can stimulate rhinovirus IRES-dependent translation .
It is therefore likely that p97 and p100 , described here , are the same protein .
RNA fragments 1 , 2 , 5 , 9 , and 10 cross-link p100 while fragments 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , and 8 do not .
One common feature among RNA fragments that cross-link p100 is the presence of an NGGY-GYC ( N represents any nucleotide and Y represents either cytosine or uridine ) helix sequence Vor .
68 , 1994 ( shown boxed in Fig .
2 ) , which is absent in fragments which do not cross-link p100 .
Cross-linking of D- , E- , and F-loop fragments to RRL and HeLa extracts .
The similarities of the F-loop and the H-loop in the EMCV IRES secondary structure ( Fig .
1A ) suggested that the F-loop may also bind p57 ( 22 ) .
Whereas both the F-loop and the H-loop are hairpins with the same loop sequence ( compare fragment 1 and fragment 11 in Fig .
2 ) , there are two major differences between the RNAs .
The H-loop contains a buiged upper helix and a closing GC base pair , while the F-loop has a perfect stem and a closing GU base pair .
These differences may be the reason for the fact that the F-loop ( fragment 11 ) did not cross-link p57 from either HeLa extract or RRL ( Fig .
3A and B , lanes 11 , and Table 1 ) .
To test whether the lack of cross-linking of p57 to fragment 11 was due to the weak closing GU base pair , resulting in a 7-base loop rather than a 5-base loop , fragment 12 was synthesized ( Fig .
2 ) .
This RNA also did not cross-link p57 ( Fig .
3A and B , lanes 12 , and Table 1 ) .
Fragments 11 and 12 did , however , cross-link pS2 very well , whereas cross-linking of p70 , p72 , and p100 could not be detected ( Fig .
3A and B and Table 1 ) .
Similar results were obtained with RRL by use of [ °°P ] JCTP- or -labeled fragments ( data not shown ) .
Cross-linking of p57 from HeLa extract and RRL to four fragments derived from the very 5 ' end of the IRES ( fragments 13 to 16 ; Fig .
2 ) are shown in Fig .
3A and B , lanes 13 to 16 , and Table 1 .
A fragment containing DEF-loops ( fragment 13 ) cross-linked p57 , while deletion of the F-loop from this fragment ( fragment 14 ) had no effect on p57 cross-linking .
The results from cross-linking experiments with fragments 11 , 13 , and 14 therefore suggest that the F-loop is neither sufficient nor necessary for p57 cross-linking .
Replacement of 19 nt of the 24-nt 5 ' terminal cytosine-rich tract in fragment 13 with seven nucleotides of linker sequence ( fragment 15 ) reduced p57 cross-linking , while the same replacement in fragment 14 ( fragment 16 ) had little or no effect on p57 cross-linking .
These results suggest that a second p57-binding site may exist at the 5 ' terminus of the EMCV IRES and that fragments 13 , 14 , and 16 , along with fragments 1 , 2 , 3 , and 10 , contain a common pS7-binding site .
.
p52 and p70 were able to cross-link all four 5° IRES fragments ( fragments 13 , 14 , 15 , and 16 ) , although with reduced cross-linking to fragment 14 .
The cross-linking signal of p100 to fragment 16 was extremely high , whereas fragment 14 cross-linked the same polypeptide with moderate efficiency and fragments 13 and 15 cross-linked with weak yet detectable efficiency .
Each of fragments 13 , 14 , 15 , and 16 contains a helix sequence that fits the NGGY-GYC pattern observed with fragments 2 , 5 , 9 , and 10 ( see the boxed sequences in Fig .
2 ) .
Cross-linking of 3 ' IRES fragments to RRL and Hela extracts .
Fragment 17 and fragment 18 represent stem-loops derived from the I-loop and the J-loop , respectively ( Fig .
1A and 2 ) .
Surprisingly , neither of these RNA fragments was able to cross-link any protein from either HeLa extract or RRL ( Fig .
3A and B , lanes 17 and 18 , and Table 1 ) .
A runoff transcript ( fragment 19 , nt 422 to 740 ; Fig .
1B ) containing IJ-loops did cross-link p52 and p100 but not p57 or p70 ( Fig .
3A and B , lanes 19 , and Table 1 ) , whereas a longer runoff transcript containing IJKLM-loops ( fragment 20 , nt 422 to 837 ; Fig .
1B ) cross-linked all four proteins , albeit very weakly ( Fig .
3A and B , lanes 20 , and Table 1 ) .
These results suggest that a third p57-binding site could exist between nt 740 and nt 837 .
To test this possibility , fragment 21 was synthesized and found to cross-link strongly to p52 , p70 , and p100 , with moderate cross-linking to p57 ( Fig .
3A and B , lanes 21 , and Table 1 ) .
EMCV IRES RNA-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS 3189 Thus , p57 may also bind a third region of the EMCV IRES , near the 3'-terminus .
DISCUSSION Three cellular proteins that cross-link fragments of various IRES elements have been proposed to be important for cap-independent translation : p57 ( 16 , 22 ) ; p52 ( 30 ) ; and p97 ( 3a ) , which is likely the same as the p100 protein described here .
Only with p57 , however , has a clear correlation between binding to the EMCV IRES and translation been demonstrated ( 22 ) .
In this paper , we examined the UV cross-linking between EMCV IRES-related RNAs and cytoplasmic polypeptides of a HeLa cell extract or of RRL .
Except for their migration in denaturing polyacrylamide gels , we did not attempt to further characterize the nature of these proteins .
The most important difference between the two cellular extracts employed here was that RRL lacks p100 .
Moreover , RRL appears to contain two cross-linking polypeptides of approximately 70 and 72 kDa , whereas the cytoplasm of HeLa cells shows only one protein migrating in this range of molecular masses ( designated as p70 ) .
Considering similarities in cross-linking specificity , the HeLa p70 polypeptide appears to correspond to the RRL p70 polypeptide .
On the basis of electrophoretic properties , we believe p57 to be pPTB ( 16 ) and p52 to be La , an IRES-binding protein described by Meerovitch et al .
( 30 ) .
The nature of p100 is , as yet , obscure .
It should be emphasized that UV cross-linking of proteins from cellular extracts to the RNA fragments described in Fig .
2 may yield quite artificial results .
On the one hand , the RNA fragments may assume secondary or tertiary structures in solution that are different from those obtained by computer analysis , and this may be particularly so for the full-length IRES RNA .
It is also possible that the recognition features on the IRES fragments are drastically different from those of the same sequence within the context of the full-length IRES , because of differences in secondary structure or the addition of vector-derived sequence to some fragments .
On the other hand , the binding of protein to RNA , as assayed by UV cross-linking , may not reveal all parameters of the interaction ( 57 ) .
These considerations are underscored by the observation that p52 , p57 , and p72 cross-link to the full-length IRES whereas p70 and p100 do not , yet the latter two polypeptides readily cross-link fragments of the IRES .
Moreover , it must be kept in mind that all conclusions drawn from cross-linking results have been obtained with protein mixtures of unknown composition and that the binding specificities of isolated proteins may be quite different ( 57 , 58 ) .
Nevertheless , we believe that our attempt to deduce the cross-linking specificity and consensus binding site of each IRES-binding protein , as outlined below , is useful for further studies of the function of IRES-mediated translation .
p57 was found to cross-link RNA fragments derived from three regions of the EMCV IRES : the 5 ' end , the H-loop , and the 3 ' end .
The various p57-binding sites do not , however , share any obvious common primary sequence elements , including UUUC-containing sequences proposed by Luz and Beck ( 27 ) or pyrimidine-rich loops proposed by Borovjagin et al .
( 4 ) .
Indeed , UUUC-containing sequences and pyrimidine-rich loops by themselves are not sufficient to confer p57 binding to an RNA ( see fragments 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 [ Fig .
2 and 3A and BJ ) .
Thus , p57 must bind a common secondary or tertiary structure that is shared by the various sites .
Results from the cross-linking of pS7 to RNA fragments with different nucleoside triphosphate labels suggest that the cross-linking site may be localized to the upper 5-bp hairpin of the second stem-loop of 3190 WITHERELL AND WIMMER fragment 1 .
Consistent with this result , removing the three adjacent stem-loops and extending the second helix of fragment 1 ( fragment 3 ) had no effect on p57 cross-linking .
5 ' and 3 ' deletions of fragment 3 , however , cross-linked with reduced intensity ( fragment 4 ) or did not cross-link at all ( fragments 6 , 7 , and 8 ) .
Thus , p57-binding determinants extend beyond the proposed cross-linking site .
Disrupting the bulge in the second stem-loop of fragment 1 , creating an internal loop , also reduced cross-linking ( fragment 2 ) .
These results suggest that the p57-binding site is localized to the second stem-loop structure of fragment 1 , which corresponds to the H-loop of the EMCV IRES .
It appears that the upper hairpin and bulged helix are most important for p57 binding , but that sequences extending beyond the 13-bp bulged hairpin contribute favorably to the interaction ( compare fragments 3 , 4 , and 6 ; Fig .
3A and B ) .
Bulged nucleotides have been found to be important for RNA binding of several proteins including the R17 coat protein ( 61 ) , ribosomal protein L10 ( 6 ) , and human immuno-deficiency virus type 1 tat ( 8 , 48 , 54 ) .
Extrahelical nucleotides are predicted to alter the structure of an RNA helix ( 3 , 52 , 55 , 56 ) by bending it 18 to 23° ( 47 , 59 , 60 ) .
Thus , p57 may contact both the upper and the lower helix in the second hairpin of fragments 1 and 3 , with the 8-nt bulge optimizing binding by placing the two helices in an orientation relative to each other that promotes p57 binding .
Moderate to weak cross-linking of p57 to several other IRES fragments was observed ( fragments 10 , 13 , 14 , 16 , and 21 ) .
Each of these fragments , except fragment 10 , contains helices separated by a single-stranded spacer .
It is possible that this spacer allows the two helices to rotate relative to each other , creating a structure that resembles a bent helix , which p57 could recognize and stabilize upon binding .
Fragment 10 also likely resembles a bent helix since it contains three helices that are predicted to form a T structure .
The bent structures formed by these RNAs would , however , be unlikely to orient the two helices in exactly the same way as an 8-nt bulged loop would , thus reducing the binding affinity and explaining the weaker cross-linking relative to fragments 1 and 3 .
The proposed bent helix binding site for p57 is consistent with p57 cross-linking to other fragments of the EMCV IRES ( 4 , 22 ) , foot-and-mouth disease virus IRES ( 27 ) , and stem-loop VI of the poliovirus 5° NTR ( 15a ) when these fragments are folded into the predicted thermodynamically most stable structure ( structures not shown ) : .
The proposed binding site is also consistent with the lack of p57 cross-linking to a mutated stem-loop VI ( 26a ) and stem-loop VII ( 29 ) of the poliovirus IRES ( structures not shown ) .
pPTB , which is very similar , if not identical , to p57 ( 16 ) , derived its name from the protein 's affinity to a track of pyrimidine residues upstream from 3 ' splice sites ( 11 ) .
The binding affinity of purified pPTB to homopolymers , however , has a K , , of > 200 nM , which is low compared to the binding affinity of the protein to fragment 1 ( K , = 20 nM [ 57 ] ) .
On the basis of the binding specificity of purified pPTB , it was suggested that pPTB greatly prefers to bind heteropolymeric RNA with a helix-spacer-helix motif ( 57 ) .
The proposal that p57 , within the context of cellular extracts , recognizes a bent helix ( two helices separated by a single-stranded bulge ) is consistent with this proposal .
Since previous studies suggest that the binding specificity of pPTB is increased by the presence of factors within HeLa extract ( 57 ) , pure pPTB may bind any helix-spacer-helix motif while pPTB , in the presence of cellular factors , may prefer to bind only one type of helix-spacer-helix motif , the bent helix .
To what extent this binding specificity relates to the function of pPTB remains to be elucidated .
The cross-linking of p72 in RRL correlated with J. Viror .
p57 cross-linking .
The relation between p72 and p57 , however , is unclear .
Most of the EMCV IRES fragments tested were found to cross-link pS2 , an observation suggesting that it has low binding specificity .
The smallest fragment that cross-links p52 is fragment 8 , which corresponds to the upper 5-bp hairpin of the H-loop .
Other fragments that contain this hairpin also cross-link p52 ( fragments 2 , 4 , 6 , and 7 ) , provided that p57 does not cross-link strongly to the same RNA ( as with fragments 1 and 3 ) .
This suggests that the pS52- and pS57-binding sites overlap , consistent with the proposal that the p57-cross-linking site , and therefore part of the p57-binding site , is in the upper hairpin of the second stem-loop of fragment 1 .
Other fragments containing hairpins with no sequence homology to the H-loop ( fragments 13 to 16 ) also cross-link p52 .
A polypeptide with a molecular mass of p52 kDa has also been observed to cross-link other EMCV IRES fragments ( 22 ) and stem-loop VI of poliovirus mRNA ( 15a ) .
These results suggest that p52 is capable of binding small stem-loop structures in a sequence-independent manner , an observation that may explain its limited cross-linking specificity .
A protein with a molecular mass of 52 kDa , recently identified as La ( 30 ) , cross-links stem-loop VII of the poliovirus IRES ( 29 ) .
Stem-loop VII consists of a small hairpin with a 5 ' single-stranded tail .
A single-nucleotide substitution that disrupts the stem-loop VII helix has been found to reduce p52/La cross-linking ( 29 ) .
It is likely that the 52-kDa protein described here is the same as that described by Meerovitch et al .
( 30 ) .
The proposal that p52/La has some affinity for RNA helices is consistent with La binding to other RNAs such as 4.5 I RNA ( 46 ) , VA RNA ( 10 ) , and EBER1 and EBER2 ( 14 ) .
Fragments 17 and 18 , however , do not cross-link p52 .
It is possible that these fragments bind p52 but lack a cross-linking site 5 to the labeled nucleotide , making it difficult to detect binding .
Alternatively , fragments 17 and 18 may contain negative binding determinants , which prevent p52 from binding ( 51 ) .
Many of the RNA fragments which cross-link the HeLa-specific 100-kDa protein ( fragments 1 , 2 , 5 , 9 , 10 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , and 21 ) were observed to contain GC-rich helices at either the 5 ' ( fragments 1 , 2 , 9 , and 10 ) or 3 ' ( fragments 14 and 16 ) terminus of the RNA ( see the boxed regions in Fig .
2 ) .
Note that the 5° GC-rich helices are present in several fragments because of T7 promoter restrictions and are not found in the full-length IRES .
Comparison of these GC-rich helices revealed similar helix sequences .
Fragments 1 and 9 contain GGGC-GUC helices , fragments 2 and 10 contain GGGC-GCC helices , and fragments 14 and 16 contain UGGC-GCC helices .
Similar helix sequences were found in fragment 5 ( CGGU-GCC ) , fragments 13 and 15 ( UGGC-GCC ) , and fragment 21 ( AGGU-GUC ) ( see the boxed regions in Fig .
2 ) .
Thus , these RNAs have a common NGGY-GYC ( N represents any nucleotide and Y represents either cytosine or uridine ) helix sequence .
This consensus sequence is lacking in all RNA fragments ( fragments 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 17 , and 18 ) which do not cross-link p100 ( Fig .
3A ) .
Fragment 16 may cross-link p100 better than fragment 14 , and fragment 15 may cross-link p100 better than fragment 13 ( Fig .
3A ) , because of the presence of a second GC-rich helix at the 5 ' terminus of fragments 15 and 16 with the sequence GGGC-GCU , closely resembling the NGGY-GYC helix sequence ( Fig .
2 ) .
Alternatively , differences in secondary structure between fragments 16 and 14 and between 15 and 13 may account for the observed differences in p100 cross-linking .
The NGGY-GYC helix sequence is also present in the thermodynamically most favored structure of a fragment derived from the poliovirus IRES stem-loop VI that cross-links a protein of approximately 100 kDa ( 26a ) .
The Vor .
68 , 1994 primary sequence of the NGGY-GYC helix could provide specific functional groups in the minor groove for interaction with p100 ( 37 ) or could alter the secondary structure of the helix , positioning phosphates or 2'-OH groups in an optimal orientation ( 32 ) for recognition and binding by p100 .
Both HeLa extract and RRL contain a polypeptide of approximately 70 kDa that cross-links several EMCV IRES fragments ( Fig .
3A and B and Table 1 ) .
Interestingly , p70 is cross-linked only to fragments which cross-link p52 ( Fig .
3A and B ) .
Fragments which cross-link p70 strongly include fragments 2 , 13 , 15 , 16 , and 21 , with weaker cross-linking observed for fragments 9 and 14 .
A common structural feature observed among most of these fragments ( fragments 2 , 9 , 13 , 14 , and 21 ) is the presence of a stacked U-C mismatch with an adjacent 5 ' pyrimidine residue ( 5 ' YU-C ) .
Although the thermodynamically most favored structure of fragments 15 and 16 lacks the 5° YU-C mismatch , suboptimal foldings of these two RNAs , within 2 kcal ( ca .
8 kJ ) of the optimal structure , do contain the mismatch .
The consensus p70-binding site is not found in any of the optimal or suboptimal foldings of other IRES fragments that do not cross-link p70 , except fragment 17 , which does not cross-link pS2 .
It is therefore possible that p70 RNA binding requires both the 5° YU-C mismatch and p52 binding .
Whether the U-C mismatch forms a non-Watson-Crick base pair is unknown .
Non-Watson-Crick base pairs have , however , been shown to be important for human immu-nodeficiency virus type 1 rev binding ( 1 ) .
Incubation of EMCV IRES RNA with a cell extract results in formation of a 208 RNP ( termed the IRESome [ 22a ) ) .
Whether this particle , the composition of which has yet to be determined , has any role in IRES function is unknown .
The assembly of an IRESome is likely complex and requires multiple components , of which some may be the polypeptides described here .
Even if p100 and p70 are unable to cross-link the full-length IRES when incubated with other polypeptides , they may still be components of the IRESome .
The binding specificities of p70 and p100 could be altered upon formation of the IRESome with the full-length IRES , thus inhibiting p70 and p100 binding , analogous to the binding and release of U4 small nuclear RNP during spliceosome assembly ( 25 ) .
Changes in binding specificity and solution properties of the R17 coat protein for its binding target have also been observed upon formation of an RNP containing the R17 coat protein ( 2 , 58 ) .
Since different proteins from RRL and HeLa extract cross-link IRES fragments , it is possible that each extract forms a slightly different RNP .
Assembly of the RRL RNP could require p52 , p57 , p70 , and p72 , whereas assembly of the HeLa RNP could require p52 , p57 , p70 , and p100 .
The possibility that different RNPs are formed with different extracts is consistent with the observation that the translational efficiencies of poliovirus mRNA and EMCV mRNA differ in HeLa extracts and in RRL ( 20 , 36 ) .
