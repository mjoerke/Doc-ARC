Inactive calcineurin is unable to activate the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , a transcription factor required for expression of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene .
IL-2 production by CsA-treated cells is therefore dramatically reduced .
We demonstrate here , however , that NFAT can be activated , and significant levels of IL-2 can be produced by the CsA-resistant CD28-signaling pathway .
In transient transfection assays , both multicopy NFAT- and IL-2 promoter-B-galactosidase reporter gene constructs could be activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) /a « CD28 stimulation , and this activation was resistant to CsA .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed the induction of a CsA-resistant NFAT complex in the nuclear extracts of peripheral blood T cells stimulated with PMA plus « CD28 .
Peripheral blood T cells stimulated with PMA/aCD28 produced IL-2 in the presence of CsA .
Collectively , these data suggest that NFAT can be activated and IL-2 can be produced in a calcineurin independent manner .
Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) is required for IL-2 production after antigenic stimulation of T cells ( 1 , 2 ) .
Upon stimulation of T cells , an NFAT-containing protein complex appears in the nucleus and recognizes two or more sites in the IL-2 promoter ( 2 , 3 ) .
The complex is composed of a preexisting cytoplasmic component , which translocates to the nu-cleus , and an inducible nuclear component composed of members of the AP1 family ( 4-6 ) .
Translocation of the cytoplasmic component involves Ca `` *-induced activation of the calcium/ calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin ( 5 , 7 ) .
Inactivation of calcineurin by the immunosuppressive drugs CsA or FK506 results in the blockage of translocation and inhibition of IL-2 production ( 7 , 8 ) .
CD28 is a T cell surface molecule that plays a major role as * This research was sponsored in part by NCI , National Institutes of Health , Department of Health and Human Services , under contract with ABL and SAIC .

a coreceptor in the optimal activation of T cells ( 9 ) .
One of the major effects of CD28 stimulation is increased production of cytokines , such as IL-2 , interferon y , granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor , and others , through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms ( 10 , 11 ) .
One of the hallmarks of the CD28 costimulation is its insensitivity to the immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506 ( 10 , 12 , 13 ) .
We reasoned that if CD28 costimulation results in IL-2 production , and if NFAT is required for the expression of IL-2 , there must be a CsA-resistant pathway for activation of NFAT .
In this report , we demonstrate that NFAT can be activated in a CsA-resistant manner .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and Tissue Culture-Freshly purified human peripheral blood T cells were greater than 95 % CD3 cells .
PMA was used at 10 ng/ml , ionomycin at 1 ug/ml , and « CD28 monoclonal antibody ( kindly provided by Dr. Carl H. June ) at 100 ng/ml .
Cyclosporin A ( 500 ng/ml ) was added 30 min before addition of the other stimuli .
Plasmids-The thymidine kinase-B-galactosidase ( TK-Bgal ) reporter plasmid was constructed by subcloning a HindlIIW/X/ol fragment containing the TK promoter from the pBLCAT2 vector ( 14 ) into the pEQ3 LacZ plasmid ( 15 ) .
The NFAT-TK-Ggal plasmid was constructed by synthesizing three copies of the IL-2 distal NFAT site ( AAAGAAAG-GAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAG ) , containing HindIII ( at the 5 end ) and BamHI ( at the 3 ' end ) restriction sites , and subcloning into the TK-Bgal plasmid .
The NFxB-TK-Bgal reporter plasmid was constructed as above , using the IgxB sequence ( ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCT ) .
The expression vectors for NFAT , and for dominant negative NFAT , ( 16 ) were generous gifts from Dr. Gerald R. Crabtree .
The pIL2-568 ( 15 ) construct ( kindly provided by Dr. Christopher B. Wilson ) was generated by subcloning the HindIII fragment ( -568 to +50 ) of the IL-2 promoter into the pEQ3 LacZ plasmid .
Transfection and B-Galactosidase Assay-Cells were transfected by a modified DEAE-dextran method ( 17 ) .
In brief , Jurkat cells were washed once with RPMI containing 50 mm Tris ( pH 7.4 ) .
Cells were resuspended in the same medium at a density of 8 X 10°/ml .
An aliquot of a 0.5-ml cell suspension containing appropriate plasmids was added to 0.5 ml of Tris-RPMI containing 500 ug/ml DEAE-dextran .
The aliquot was incubated for 1 h with occasional stirring , then centrifuged , washed once with Tris-RPML , and resuspended in 5 ml of RPMI ( 10 % fetal calf serum ) and plated in a six-well plate .
The cells were stimulated after 24 h and harvested for B-galactosidase assay 18 h after stimulation .
When multiple stimulations for a particular plasmid ( s ) were used , transfection was done in a single tube .
After transfection , cells were divided into groups depending on the various stimulations .
B-Galactosidase was assayed as reported ( 18 ) .
The results were expressed as activity , calculated as follows : ( A ; , , /ug of protein ) X 10° .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSA ) -The preparation of nuclear extracts and EMSA were performed as described previously ( 19 ) .
The oligonucleotides used were : IL-2 distal NFAT site ( 5'-AAA-GAAAGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAG-3 ' ) , API site from human collagenase gene ( b'-agetATGAGTCAGACACCTCTGGCTTTCTGGA-AGG-3 ' ) , SP1 site from HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( 5'-GATCGGGAG-GCGT GGCCTGGGCGGCGACTGGGGAGTGGCGA-3 ' ) .

NFAT-TK-Bgal and TK-Ggal constructs ( 10 ug each ) were transiently transfected into Jurkat cells along with NFAT , expression vector ( 10 ug ) .
The cells were subsequently stimulated as described above .
The average of two separate experiments is shown here .
highly conserved in all NFAT proteins described to date .
The peptide is found in the Rel homology domain , and its sequence is NH , -SDIEL-RKGETDIGRKNTR .
Antiserum @ NFAT , , was raised against a peptide specific to NFAT , Its sequence is VPAIKTEPSDEYEPSLI ( sequence in murine NFAT , but the antiserum also recognizes the human protein ) .
Cytokine Testing-Human IL-2 was measured by ELISA ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ) test kits from Genzyme Corp. ( Cam-bridge , MA ) .
The assays were performed by the Clinical Immunology Services Program , SAIC , NCI-FCRDC , Frederick , MD .
RESULTS Induction of NFAT Activity in a CsA-resistant Pathway-To investigate whether NFAT can be activated by CD28 costimu-lation , three copies of the distal NFAT site from the IL-2 promoter were subcloned into a TK-Bgal reporter gene construct , designated as NFAT-TK-Bgal .
This construct was transfected into Jurkat T cells , and NFAT activity was assayed after various treatments of the cells .
Since we were looking for a CsA-resistant pathway , we could not use « CD3 as a stimulus , because one of the pathways it activates is Ca `` Therefore , we chose to mimic the Ca**-independent aspect of « CD3 signaling by PMA , as described previously ( 20 ) .
PMA alone had little effect on reporter activity ( Fig .
1A ) and « CD28 alone had no effect ( data not shown ) , but the combination of PMA and « CD28 resulted in significant activity ( about 4-fold induction relative to the vector alone ) .
Strikingly , nearly all of this ( PMA + « CD28 ) -induced activity was resistant to CsA .
In contrast , NFAT activity induced by PMA + ionomycin was essentially completely CsA-sensitive ( Fig .
1B ) .
These results suggest that , in addition to the well-known Ca* `` *-dependent pathway , there is a second Ca**-independent way to activate NFAT .
In the experiment described above , it was possible that the assay measured some other unknown factor able to bind to the NFAT sites in the reporter plasmid rather than bona fide NFAT activity .
To test this , the assays were repeated in the presence of cotransfected NFAT , , .
Consistent with the results of others ( 16 , 21 ) , NFAT , had little effect on the multicopy NFAT reporter in untreated cells ( Fig .
1C ) , but had a marked effect in cells stimulated with PMA and « CD28 ( 15-fold induction of NFAT activity relative to the vector alone ) .
As before , this induction was insensitive to CsA .
In the same assay , promoter activity induced by PMA + ionomycin was abolished in the presence of CsA ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that overexpressed NFAT , protein can be activated through a CsA-resistant pathway .
In order to determine whether the IL-2 promoter can also be activated by a CsA-resistant pathway , the 568-base pair IL-2 promoter-B-galactosidase reporter construct ( designated as plL2-568 ) was tested in the transient transfection assay ( Fig .
2 ) .
Like the multicopy NFAT-TK-Bgal construct , pIL2-568 showed much higher promoter activity after PMA/ « CD28 stimulation compared to either the unstimulated control or to PMA alone ( panel A ) .
This activity was further increased in the presence of overexpressed NFAT , protein ( panel B ) .
The vector alone did not have any activity ( data not shown ) .
The inducible promoter activity was completely resistant to CsA ( panels A and B ) , whereas CsA suppressed PMA/ionomycin-inducible promoter activity ( panel C ) .
To test whether the promoter activity induced by PMA + « CD28 was mediated by NFAT , a dominant-negative NFAT , protein ( 16 ) was tested in transient transfection assay .

Activation of an IL-2 promoter-6-galactosidase reporter gene construct in the presence of CsA .
A , the pIL2-568 reporter gene ( 5 ug ) along with expression vector alone or in combination with the expression vector for a dominant negative form of NFAT , ( 5 ug ) was transiently transfected into Jurkat cells and was subsequently stimulated as described above .
B , the pIL2-568 reporter gene along with the NFAT , expression vector ( 5 ug each ) in the presence or absence of the dominant negative NFAT , ( 5 ug ) was transfected into Jurkat cells that were subsequently stimulated as described in Fig .
1 .
The amount of transfected plasmids was normalized by adding the empty vector , pBJ5 .
C , similar experiment as B except the stimulation was with PMA and ionomycin .
D , the NFxB-TK-Bgal reporter gene was transfected into Jurkat cells along with the expression vector for the dominant negative NFAT , ( 5 ug each ) .
Cells were subsequently stimulated as described in Fig .
1. of the dominant negative resulted in 70-80 % inhibition of PMA/CD28-inducible promoter activity , but , as expected , the dominant negative NFAT , protein had very little effect on an NFxB-TK-Bgal reporter construct ( panel D ) .
These data demonstrate that the IL-2 promoter can be activated by PMA/ eCD28 in a CsA-resistant manner , and that this activation is mediated by NFAT .
Induction of an NFAT Complex by PMA and « CD28 in the Presence of CsA-Induction of NFAT activity implies induction of the DNA-binding NFAT complex in the nuclei of stimulated cells .
To look for this complex , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using the IL-2-distal NFAT site as a probe .
As shown in Fig .
3A , nuclear extract of Jurkat T cells stimulated with PMA and « CD28 showed an inducible complex ( compare lane 1 with 2 ) which comigrated with the PMA/ionomycin-inducible complex ( Zane 4 ) .
The PMA/aCD28-inducible complex was resistant to CsA ( lane 3 ) , whereas the PMA/ ionomycin-induced complex was sensitive to CsA ( Zane 5 ) .
The PMA/aCD28-inducible complex was specific to the probe as demonstrated by the competition assay with specific ( lane 6 ) and nonspecific ( lane 8 ) competitors .
The complex was completely blocked in the presence of a consensus API site ( lane 7 ) indicating the involvement of AP1 in the inducible complex .
To confirm that the inducible complex contained NFAT protein , we performed supershift analysis .
As shown in Fig .
3B , antiserum raised against a peptide that is common to all NFAT proteins was able to block the inducible complex ( Zane 2 ) .
Another antiserum raised against an NFAT , -specific epitope showed a partial supershift ( Zane 4 ) , whereas an irrelevant antiserum failed to react with the complex ( Zane 3 ) .
As shown in Fig .
3C , a PMA/aCD28-inducible complex was also present in the nuclear extracts of peripheral blood T cells ( compare lane 2 with 1 ) .
As in Jurkat cells , this inducible complex was insensitive to CsA , whereas the PMA/ionomycin-inducible complex was sensitive to CsA ( compare lanes 10 and 11 ) .
Competition assays and supershift analysis revealed that the PMA/aCD28 complex contained NFAT protein as well as the members of the AP1 family .
These data show that in Jurkat cells and in peripheral blood T cells the NFAT DNA-binding complex can be induced in a CsA-resistant manner by PMA/aCD28 stimulation .
Production of IL-2 by Peripheral Blood T Cells after Stimulation with PMA and « CD28 in the Presence of CsA-It has been shown previously that treatment of peripheral blood T cells with PMA + « CD28 leads to IL2 production , and that this induction is largely resistant to CsA ( 10 , 12 , 13 ) .
We expected this to be true under our conditions as well , since reporter assays showed activation of the IL-2 promoter and EMSA showed induction of the NFAT complex .
To test for IL-2 production , peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with PMA and aCD28 for 18 h with or without CsA .
As shown in Fig .
4 , stimulation in the absence of CsA resulted in the production of over 200 units/ml of IL-2 ; in the presence of CsA , IL-2 was produced at 70-85 % of this level ( the slight drop may be due to toxic effects from the high concentration of drug used ( 500 ng/ml ) ) .
In contrast , CsA drastically reduced IL-2 production ( to 7 % of the level produced without CsA ) in cells stimulated with PMA + ionomycin .
In absolute terms as well , CsA-resistant IL-2 levels are substantially higher in PMA-CD28 stimulated cells ( 140 units/ml ) than in PMA/ionomycin-treated cells ( 24 units/ml ) .
These data demonstrate the physiological significance of CsA-resistant NFAT activation .

Production of IL-2 by peripheral blood T cells .
Peripheral blood T cells isolated from two different donors were stimulated with medium alone , PMA/CD28 , PMA/CD28/CsA , PMA/ionomycin , and PMA/ionomycin/CsA for 24 h. IL-2 secreted into the medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
CsA was added to the cells 30 min prior to stimulation .
DISCUSSION Previous studies have shown that the immunosuppressive drug CsA drastically inhibits , but does not completely block , IL-2 production following stimulation by « CD3 and eCD28 ( 10 ) .
The drug-resistant activity can most likely be traced to the CD28 signaling pathway , since stimulation of cells with PMA ( to mimic the Ca**-independent aspects of « CD3 signaling ) and « CD28 is entirely resistant to CsA ( 10 ) .
In this case , IL-2 is produced at significant levels in the continued presence of CsA or FK506 .
Since the transcription factor NFAT is required for expression of the IL-2 gene , these results imply that , in addition to the well-known Ca**-dependent pathway , NFAT can be activated by a CsA-resistant pathway .
Data presented here show that this is the case .
The involvement of NFAT in the activation of reporter gene constructs ( both NFAT-TK-Bgal and pIL2-568 ) after PMA/ « CD28 treatment in the presence of CsA was demonstrated by the facts that ( i ) overexpressed wild type NFAT augmented reporter activity only after PMA/aCD28 stimulation , and ( ii ) the inducible reporter activity was essentially eliminated in the presence of a dominant negative mutant of NFAT .
The presence of NFAT in the PMA/aCD28-inducible DNA-protein complexes was also demonstrated by the supershift assays .
In agreement with the transient transfection assays , the peripheral blood T cells were also shown to produce IL-2 after PMA/ « CD28 treatment , and this production was resistant to CsA .
The established pathway for NFAT activation involves Ca** dependent activation of the serine-threonine phosphatase cal-cineurin .
Subsequent dephosphorylation of NFAT leads to its nuclear translocation and , in conjunction with AP-1 , DNA binding .
The data presented here suggest an alternate pathway for NFAT activation that is calcineurin independent .
Since dephosphorylation of NFAT appears to be necessary for its activity , a different phosphatase must be involved in this pathway .
A candidate second messenger ( instead of Ca** ) is ceram-ide , which has been reported to be involved in CD28 signaling ( 22 , 23 ) .
Interestingly , a serine/threonine phosphatase has been reported recently that is involved in the sphingomyelin 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 7704 pathway ( 24 ) .
It is an attractive hypothesis that this or another ceramide-induced phosphatase can lead to NFAT activation in a CsA-resistant manner .
This idea is currently being tested .
The present finding may explain the ineffectiveness of CsA in the treatment of graft versus host disease following allogenic bone marrow transplantation ( 25 , 26 ) .
The cytotoxic T cells thought to be responsible for graft versus host disease ( 27 ) express CD28 on their surface and are capable of producing cytokines responsible for immune reaction in the presence of CsA .
