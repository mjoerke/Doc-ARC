3 Constitutive Expression of p50 Homodimer in Freshly Isolated Human Monocytes Decreases with In Vitro and In Vivo Differentiation : a Possible Mechanism Influencing Human Immunodeficiency Virus Replication in Monocytes and Mature Macrophages SHARON R. LEWIN , PAUL LAMBERT , NICK J. DEACON , JOHN MILLS , anp SUZANNE M. CROWE* National Centre for HIV Virology Research , Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research , Fairfield , Victoria 3078 , Australia Received 29 May 1996/Accepted 3 December 1996 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replicates more efficiently in vitro in differentiated macrophages than in freshly isolated monocytes .
We investigated whether this may be partly explained by changes in expression of NF-KB with monocyte differentiation .
We demonstrated that constitutive expression of NF-KB in primary human monocytes changed significantly with differentiation in vitro to monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMs ) and differentiation in vivo to alveolar macrophages ( AMs ) .
Freshly isolated monocytes constitutively expressed high levels of transcriptionally inactive p50 homodimer which decreased with time in culture in favor of the transcriptionally active p50/p65 and pS50/ReIB heterodimers .
As in MDMs , AMs constitutively expressed p50/p65 and p50/ReIB although at lower levels .
HIV infection of fresh monocytes failed to induce p50/p65 as seen in MDMs .
The replacement of p50 homodimers with transcriptionally active heterodimers following time in culture may partially explain the progressive increase in susceptibility of monocytes to HIV infection during in vitro culture .
The change in NF- < B components with monocyte differentiation in vivo may also explain the different transcriptional activities of these cell populations in HIV infected individuals .
is a transcription factor ( 2 ) which strongly activates transcription of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) provi-rus in T cells ( 22 ) and monocytic cells ( 1 , 10 , 33 ) .
The NF- « B/ Rel family of proteins is a group of structurally and functionally related transcription factors and includes p50 ( NF-KB1 ) , p52 ( NF-KB2 ) , p65 ( RelA ) , RelB , and c-Rel , which can form a variety of homo- and heterodimers .
There is a homologous region within each member of this family known as the Rel homology domain which is responsible for DNA binding , dimerization , and nuclear localization ( 33 , 34 ) .
The carboxyl-terminal regions of p65 , c-Rel , and ReIB contain transcription activation domains ( 3 , 26 , 34 ) , while p50 and pS2 lack these domains .
p50 has been shown to inhibit transactivation of several genes including those controlled by the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( 7 , 8 , 34 ) .
A family of serine proteases expressed exclusively in myelomonocytic cells has been de-scribed , which cleaves the C terminus of the NF- « B subunit p65 in vitro ( 6 ) ; these proteases may explain previous reports of novel fast-migrating NF- « B-specific complexes associated with restricted HIV expression in certain myelomonocytic cells ( 23 , 27-29 ) .
Monocytes and macrophages differ in their ability to support HIV replication both in vitro ( 24 , 30 , 39 ) and in vivo ( 16 , 37 ) .
In general , HIV replication in monocytes appears to require at least partial differentiation ( 30 , 36 , 38 , 39 ) and is enhanced by factors that promote differentiation ( 14 , 17 , 35 ) .
Recently , a block prior to the initiation of reverse transcription has been * Corresponding author .

2114 demonstrated to occur in fresh monocytes .
However , reverse transcription was initiated if the cells were maintained in culture for as little as 24 h prior to infection , and increasing the time in culture prior to exposure to HIV resulted in a greater percentage of cells infected ( 38 ) .
Monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMs ) and alveolar macrophages ( AMs ) express fewer surface CD4 receptors than do freshly isolated monocytes ( 19 , 24 , 39 ) but are more susceptible to infection ( 30 ) .
However , the differences following HIV infection of fresh monocytes , MDMs , and AMs in the numbers of initiated and complete viral transcripts do not fully explain the relative differences in permissiveness to infection ( 30 ) .
Therefore , monocyte differentiation , although associated with changes in events prior to reverse transcription , may also involve intracellular changes which enhance HIV replication .
We report here that differentiation of fresh monocytes , either in vitro or in vivo , was associated with significant changes in the constitutive expression of NF-kB .
Fresh monocytes predominantly express a p50 homodimer ; with differentiation , p50 homodimer expression decreases and is replaced by p50/p65 and p50/ReIB heterodimers .
The replacement of p50 homodimers with transcriptionally active heterodimers following time in culture may partially explain the progressive increase in susceptibility of monocytes to HIV infection during in vitro culture .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Nuclear extracts .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by a high-salt extraction method ( 4a ) using some modifications described by Bellas et al .
( 4 ) .
This method allowed the use of small numbers of cells and minimized proteolysis , a common problem in the manipulation of myelomonocytic cells .
Briefly , 5 X 10° to 10 % 10° cells were collected , washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline ( Cytosys-tems , Sidney , Australia ) , and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 2 mM MgCl ; , 5 mM KCI , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM EDTA ) , which was then Vor .
71 , 1997 adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 by the addition of an equal volume of buffer A plus 1.0 % Nonidet P-40 .
Following incubation on ice for 5 min , nuclei were pelleted at 500 x g for 5 min at 4°C .
Nuclei were extracted in high-salt buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.5 } , 0.5 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] ) for 30 min on ice .
All buffers were supplemented with the following protease inhibitors : phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 2 mM ; aprotinin , 0.2 pg/ml ; leupeptin , 0.5 pg/ml ; pepstatin , 0.7 pg/ml ; antipain , 50 g/ml ; trypsin inhibitor , 50 pg/ml ; and chymostatin , 20 pg/ml ( all from Bochr-inger Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) .
Cell debris was removed by centrifu-gation at 13,000 x g , and the supernatant was dialyzed for 2 h against buffer B ( 10 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 7.5 ] , 90 mM KCI , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM NaCl , 2 mM PMSF , 1 mM DTT ) .
Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C .
The concentrations of protein in nuclear extract samples were determined by using bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) as the standard .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) .
Two to 4 pg of protein extract was incubated with 10° cpm ( 0.1 to 0.5 ng ) of radiolabelled double-stranded oligonucleotide .
The double-stranded probes were end filled with [ a-*P ] dCTP by using Klenow fragment ( Promega ) .
A final volume of 20 wl contained binding buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 8.0 ] , 5 mM MgCl , , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mg of BSA per ml , 1 mM DTT ) and 0.1 mg of poly ( dI-dC ) .
The final concentration of NaCl was 60 mM .
Reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and electrophoresed on 6 % ( acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio , 29:1 ) prerun ( 1 h , 250 to 350 V ) polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 % TBE ( Tris-borate-EDTA ) and visualized by autoradiography .
DNA binding competition was assessed by preincubating the reaction mixture prior to the addition of the probe , with a 100-fold excess of either unlabelled oligonucleotide ( specific competitor ) or unlabelled oligonucleotide in which the NF- « B binding sites had been mutated ( nonspecific compet-itor ) .
The oligonucleotide used in the binding reaction corresponded to the NF- « B binding sequence present within the enhancer of the HIV LTR ( 5'-TA CAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTG-3 ' ) .
The sequence of the nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide was 5'-TACAACTCACT TTCCGCTGCTCACTTITTCCAGGGAGGCGTG-3 ' .
The oligonucleotide containing an Sp1 binding site , 5'-GATCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGATC-3 ' , ( a kind gift from Anna Peeters , Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research , Fairfield , Australia ) was end labelled with [ y-*°P ] dATP .
All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 381A DNA Synthesizer by using phosphoramidite chemistry .
Antibodies .
The antibodies used in the supershift assays included mouse polyclonal anti-p50 ( a kind gift from K. P. LeClair ) and anti-p65 , anti-p52 , anti-c-Rel , and anti-RelB ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , Calif. ) .
Control antibodies included preimmune mouse and rabbit immunoglobulin G ( Sigma Immuno-chemicals , St. Louis , Mo . )
.
Monocytes , MDMs , AMs , and monocytic cell lines .
Monocytes were isolated on the day of blood collection from HIV-seronegative buffy packs ( Red Cross Blood Bank , Melbourne , Australia ) by density gradient purification and plastic adherence as detailed previously ( 5 , 39 ) .
Monocyte cultures were 90 % + 3 % monocytes as determined by flow cytometric analysis using anti-CD11c mono-clonal antibody ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , Calif. ) .
The nonadherent cells were collected and are referred to here as peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) .
In some experiments monocytes were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) by using a magnetic activated cell sorter ( MACS ; Miltenyi , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) .
PBMCs were incubated with anti-CD3 and CD19 antibodies ( hybridomas OKT3 and FMC63 ) and goat anti-mouse antibody bound to magnetic beads ( Miltenyi ) .
These monocytes contained only 2 to 3 % CD3- or CD19-positive cells as assessed by flow cytometry .
MDMs were cultured in polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon pots ( Saville , Minnetonka , Minn. ) and harvested after 5 to 7 days in suspension culture .
AMs were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage from healthy donors who gave informed consent ( as approved by our institution 's Human Ethics Commit-tee ) .
AMs were obtained as previously described ( 19 ) .
They were then purified by cither adherence or immunomagnetic bead selection as described above .
Nuclear extraction was performed on the day of isolation .
RCZA monocytic cells ( kind gift from W. Boyle , University of Melbourne , Melbourne , Australia ) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( Flow Laboratories ) .
All solutions and media used in purification and culture were endotoxin free as assessed by a chromogenic Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay ( Whittaker Bio-products , Walkersville , Md . )
.
In experiments assessing the response to lipopoly-saccharide ( LPS ) , 0.1 mg of LPS per ml was added to fresh monocytes and MDMs and nuclear extracts were harvested 4 h later .
Protein electrophoresis .
Protein ( 10 pg ) was denatured in 2-mercaptocthanol at 100°C for 2 min and run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-10 % polyacrylamide gel at 150 V for 1 h. The gel was fixed with methanol-glacial acetic acid and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue ( Bio-Rad ) overnight .
HIV infection .
Fresh monocytes and MDMs were infected with HIV type 1 ( HIV-1 ) isolate HIV-1p , 1 , ( 9 ) or a primary macrophage-tropic patient isolate HIV-147 , ( kindly donated by Dale McPhee , Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research ) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 ( as assessed by end point titration in MDMs ) .
Virus stock suspensions were prepared by a single passage of HIV-15 , 4 , through MDMs followed by a single amplification in PBMCs .
The primary isolate HIV-157 , had been passaged through PBMCs no more than three times .
HIV-1 virus stocks were treated with 10 U of RNase-free DNase ( Boe- EXPRESSION OF NF- « B IN FRESH MONOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES - 2115 FM PBLs MDM s sC -is !

Control cultures were mock infected with supernatant that had been prepared in parallel with virus amplification by using the same donor PBMCs .
The cells were pulsed with virus or mock supernatant for 4 h at 37°C and then washed twice in PBS .
The cells were collected 24 h later for nuclear extraction .
At the same time , 10° cells were lysed , heated , and subjected to PCR amplification using primers to gag ( SK38 and SK39 ) and HLA-DQ ( GH26 and GH27 ) as previously published ( 18 ) .
Cells ( 105 per well ) were allowed to adhere to a 24-well plate ( Costar ) , and supernatant was collected at days 7 and 14. p24 antigen was assessed by using the Abbot p24 antigen quantitation kit following the manufacturer 's instructions .
RESULTS Freshly isolated monocytes constitutively express high levels of a fast-migrating NF-KB complex .
EMSA of nuclear extracts from freshly isolated monocytes , unstimulated PBLs , and MDMs showed that specific NF-kB complexes differed in these cell populations .
An abundant fast-migrating complex was observed in nuclear extracts from freshly isolated monocytes , while the predominant complex in MDM extracts migrated more slowly ( Fig .
1 ) .
The appearance of the fast-migrating complex did not alter with different methods of monocyte purification , either adherence or magnetic bead negative selection ( data not shown ) .
The fast-migrating complex persisted even when nuclear extracts were prepared in the presence or absence of chymostatin ( data not shown ) .
Low levels of constitutively expressed , slow-migrating NF-kB were observed in unstimulated PBLs as previously described ( 12 ) .

EMSA and supershift analysis on nuclear extracts from fresh monocytes ( 2 to 4 pg/lane ) .
Nuclear extracts were incubated with probe alone ( lane 1 ) or in the presence ( + ) of a specific competitor ( SC ) ( lane 2 ) or a nonspecific competitor ( NSC ) ( lane 3 ) .
Antibodies used included antibodies to p50 ( lane 4 ) , p65 ( Jane 5 ) , and c-Rel ( lane 6 ) , and control antibodies were mouse ( lane 7 ) and rabbit ( lane 8 ) preimmune sera .
Symbols : P , p50/p65 heterodimer ; [ > , p30 homodimer .
Freshly isolated monocytes constitutively express high levels of p50 homodimer , while MDMs constitutively express p50/ p65 and pS50/ReIB heterodimers .
The fast-migrating NF- « B complex in fresh monocytes was supershifted by antibodies to p50 but not by antibodies to p65 or c-Rel , or by mouse or rabbit preimmune sera ( Fig .
2 ) or by antibodies to p52 or ReIB ( data not shown ) , showing that the fast-migrating complex was a p50 homodimer .
Because the p65 antibody used was directed against the N terminus and failed to shift the fast-migrating complex ( Fig .
2 , lane 5 ) , we conclude that this complex did not contain p65 truncated at the carboxyl-terminal region as previously reported for monocytic cell lines ( 6 ) .
The slower-migrating complex in fresh monocytes was a doublet .
The upper band was supershifted by antibodies to p50 and p65 , indicating that it consists of p50/p65 heterodimers ( Fig .
2 , lanes 4 and 5 ) , while the lower band was supershifted by antibodies to p50 and RelB ( data not shown ) .
The slower-migrating complex in MDMs was a doublet , with the upper band supershifted by antibodies to p50 and p65 and the lower band supershifted by antibodies to p50 and RelB ( Fig .

The doublet disappeared when nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies to both p65 and RelB ( Fig .

EXPRESSION OF NF- « B IN FRESH MONOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES 2117 Human AMs constitutively express low levels of p50/p65 and p50/ReIB .
Nuclear extracts from AMs analyzed by EMSA revealed a doublet which was specific for NF- « B as demonstrated by specific and nonspecific competition experiments using the oligonucleotides noted in the legend to Fig .

The upper band supershifted by antibodies to both p50 and p65 , and the lower band supershifted by antibodies to p50 and RelB ( Fig .

This supershift is best demonstrated when both p65 and RelB are incubated with the nuclear extract together ( Fig .
5 , lane 8 ) .
Low levels of expression were observed despite high levels of extracted nuclear protein ( 5 to 10 ug of nuclear protein per lane ) .
A small amount of degradation of p50/p65 was observed as a fast-migrating complex ( Fig .
5 ) that shifted with both p50 and p65 .
This was observed in only one of three AM nuclear extracts .
Coomassie brilliant blue staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-resolved nuclear extracts from AMs , fresh monocytes , and a differentiated monocytic cell line , RC2A , revealed a similar banding pattern without nonspecific smearing ( data not shown ) , showing that the reduced levels of NF-kB in AM were not a consequence of a generalized protein degradation by cellular proteases occurring during nuclear extraction .
EMSA with a radioactively labelled oligonucleotide containing the Sp1 binding site showed that AMs had a binding pattern similar to that of the RCZA cell line but markedly reduced in intensity ( data not shown ) .

infection than MDMs ( 39 ) , but although no gag proviral DNA was seen at the time of nuclear extraction , 24 h postinfection ( Fig .

The mean p24 level 7 days following infection with ; , of fresh monocytes was 719 pg/ml ( range , 97 to 2,094 pg/ml ; r » = 5 ) , and following infection of MDMs , it was 4,862 pg/ml ( range , 642 to 8,845 pg/ml ; n = 4 ) .
In contrast , we found that LPS induced p50/p65 expression in fresh monocytes but not in MDMs ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION This study demonstrates that fresh monocytes , macrophages derived from monocytes by in vitro culture ( MDMs ) and AMs each have a distinctive pattern of constitutive expression of NF-kB .
This is the first analysis of NF- « B expression in primary differentiated human macrophages , namely , in AMs .
In fresh monocytes , the predominant NF- « B species expressed is p50 homodimer , while the predominant species expressed in macrophages which have differentiated in vitro ( MDM ) or in vivo ( AM ) are p50/p65 and p50/ReIB .
Furthermore , as fresh monocytes differentiate in vitro , there is a progressive loss of p50 homodimer , altering the balance in favor of p50/p65 and p5S0/ReIB .
Our findings of a predominant p50 homodimer in fresh monocytes and the replacement of this homodimer by p50/p65 and p50/ReIB may explain the progressive increase in susceptibility to HIV infection these cells undergo during differentiation ( 30 , 39 ) .
The p50 homodimer has DNA binding activity but is thought , under most circumstances , to be transcriptionally inactive and possibly inhibitory to transactivation of the HIV LTR ( 8 , 34 ) .
Although it has been demonstrated that the block in HIV replication in fresh monocytes is prior to reverse transcription ( 38 ) , this block is in fact overcome when monocytes are cultured for only 24 h prior to HIV infection , and a progressive increase in permissiveness to infection is observed with subsequent time in culture ( 36 , 38 , 39 ) .
Therefore , a block to proviral transcription could further and independently modulate replication of the HIV particles that manage to enter and integrate into the host genome in monocytes cultured for 24 h or more .
Our experiments show that nuclear extracts from fresh monocytes contained chiefly p50 homodimer with small amounts of p50/p65 and p50/ReIB heterodimers .
It has been reported that some monocytic cell extracts contain a form of p50/p65 in which p65 has been truncated at the C terminus , giving rise to an altered heterodimer which comigrates with the p50 homodimer ( 6 ) .
This cleavage event evidently took place during cell extraction , as this complex did not appear if particular protease inhibitors ( chymostatin , 3,4-dichloroisocouma-rin , diisopropyl fluorophosphate , or alpha 1l-antitrypsin ) were included in the extraction buffers .
The p50 homodimer we observed was clearly not the aberrant p50/p65 heterodimer described by Franzoso et al .
( 6 ) .
In our work , having chymostatin present during cell extraction did not eliminate the p50 homodimer .
In addition , the anti-p65 we used was a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 3 to 19 , within the amino terminus of p65 ; this antibody failed to shift the fast-migrating complex .
We did , however , see evidence of a truncated complex in one nuclear extract from AMs as shown in Fig .
5 .
Griffin et al .
( 10 ) analyzed NF-kB in monocytes , adherent macrophages , and mouse peritoneal macrophages and found NF- « B was constitutively expressed in monocytes and macrophages .
However , the age and mode of purification of the cells J. ViRoL .
were not specified , and supershift assays to determine the constituents of the NF- « xB complex were not performed .
Suzan et al .
( 40 ) describe clear differences in the NF-kB subunits expressed in uninfected and HIV-infected monocytes and macrophages , but the nuclear extracts were prepared from cells cultured for at least 3 days , at a time when our data show a predominance of p50/p65 heterodimers .
Differences in reported constitutive expression of NF-KB in primary monocytes have been attributed to mode of purification and culture conditions ( 33 , 40 ) .
In light of the finding that expression of IkxBa ( MAD-3 ) is induced within 30 min of monocyte adherence to plastic ( 11 ) , we prepared monocytes by adherence and also by immunomagnetic bead negative selection ( to ensure minimal activation ) and found similar levels of expression of p50 homodimer in fresh monocytes prepared either way ( data not shown ) .
Our finding of constitutive expression of p50/p65 and p50/ ReIB in AMs is the first direct demonstration of NF- « B expression in primary human macrophages and is consistent with data from mouse peritoneal macrophages ( 10 ) .
The functional significance of NF-kB-activated transcription in the HIV life cycle is controversial .
The single NF-KB site of simian immunodeficiency virus SIV nce , is essential for efficient replication of SIV mace , , in macaque AMs but not in macaque PBLs ( 4 ) .
Although the NF-B sites of HIV-1 are a critical activator of transcription in monocytic cell lines when assessed by an HIV LTR-CAT expression vector ( 10 , 21 ) , their importance for replication of HIV in differentiated macrophages is un-known .
However , constitutive expression of p50/p65 and p50/ RelB would clearly favor productive HIV replication in these cells .
In fact , in vivo HIV viral load studies have shown that AMs produce infectious virus more frequently than circulating monocytes ( 37 ) .
HIV infection induces sustained NF-kB binding activity in certain HIV-infected monocytic cell lines ( 1 , 25 , 29 , 31 , 32 , 40 ) and in MDMs ( 20 , 40 ) .
In contrast to monocytic cell lines and MDMs , no change in NF- « B was demonstrated following exposure of fresh monocytes to HIV .
The failure of HIV to induce pS50/p65 in fresh monocytes may be due simply to a block prior to reverse transcription as recently demonstrated ( 38 ) .
However , binding alone without entry and reverse transcription may be sufficient to induce NF-kB , since induction of can be inhibited in CD4* T cells by CD4 ligands such as CD4 antibodies or gp120 ( 13 ) .
Although a previous study has shown a block to HIV infection of fresh monocytes ( 38 ) , virus binding almost certainly occurs ( as there is abundant surface CD4 ) , and other groups have demonstrated entry and reverse transcription ( 15 , 30 , 41 ) .
Productive HIV infection of fresh monocytes may appear to occur if the virus inoculum is allowed to persist beyond 24 h , at which time entry and reverse transcription can occur .
We have shown this by infecting fresh monocytes with HIV and then culturing them for 14 days in the presence of recombinant soluble CD4 .
The late rise in supernatant p24 antigen which occasionally occurs in untreated monocytes was completely inhibited by recombinant soluble CD4 ( data not shown ) .
In conclusion , we have identified heretofore unrecognized differences in constitutive and inducible expression of NF-kB in primary monocytes and macrophages .
These differences may be partially responsible for the relative permissiveness of monocytes and macrophages to HIV infection in vitro and the different transcriptional activities of these cell populations in vivo .
