For this purpose , mice were immunized with a fusion protein including the sequence of hMR .
After ELISA screening , mAb 18C7 was selected for its specificity towards the HBD .
This antibody recognized both the denatured and native MR forms , as well as the hetero-oligomeric MR form and the transformed MR state .
By using several HBD subfragments , the mAb 18C7 epitope was located in the N-terminal region of the HBD from Thr'* `` to Leu `` `` `` .
We then studied the effect of the antibody on aldosterone and progesterone binding to the hMR .
When 18C7 was incubated with liganded MR , it was able to partly displace ( 20 % ) the hormone from its binding site .
When 18C:7 was incubated with MR before aldosterone or progesterone , the antibody inhibited 75-80 % of the binding .
The effect of 18C7 on the binding was similar with both hormones .
A sucrose gradient analysis indicated the simultaneous presence of two kinds of receptor complexes : the steroid-MR complex and the antibody-MR complex .
After its associated proteins , especially the heat-shock protein hsp90 , had been cross-linked with the hMR by dimethylpimelimidate , 18C7 was still able to react with the receptor .
Our results indicated that the epitope recognized by 18C7 was directly implicated in hormone binding .

Because of the similar behaviours of aldosterone and progesterone , we conclude that the N-terminal region of the HBD is similarly involved in the binding of both hormones .
INTRODUCTION The human mineralocorticoid receptor ( hMR ) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor family [ 1 ] .
The hMR , as part of this family [ 2,3 ] , has been characterized at the molecular level by the presence of functional domains related to ligand binding , DNA binding and transcriptional regulation .
Owing to its long N-terminal region , the hMBR is larger than other steroid receptors with its 984-residue sequence .
It is most closely related to the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) : their DNA-binding domains share approximately 94 % similarity , whereas their C-terminal hormone-binding domains ( HBDs ) show 57 % similarity .
In addition to providing structural features for the hormone-binding site , the 250-residue C-terminus is assumed to be responsible for multiple functions of this receptor because it harbours a ligand-dependent transcriptional activation factor and a hormone-dependent nuclear localization signal .
This domain is also involved in the receptor dimerization and the binding of heat-shock proteins ( hsps ) , and recently it has been shown to bind actin [ 4 ] .
As for the other members of the family , unliganded hMR is a soluble hetero-oligomeric complex that includes hsp90 [ 5,6 ] and probably other receptor-associated proteins ( hsp70 and hsp56 ) ( reviewed in [ 7,8 ] ) .
The presence of these associated proteins is necessary for binding the physiological hMBR ligand , the steroid hormone aldosterone [ 6,9 ] , as well as the natural antagonist progesterone and synthetic anti-mineralocorticoid spirolactones .
After binding the ligand , a conformational change occurs in the C-terminal part of the hMR , and it has been demonstrated that agonists and antagonists induce different hMR conformations [ 10,11 ] .
Then dissociation of hsp90 occurs , a process known as activation or transformation , which provides the DNA-binding form of hMR .
MR antibodies were mainly produced for the purpose of localizing the receptor and were raised against preselected peptide sequences located on the N-terminal region [ 12-14 ] or derived from the hinge region [ 15 ] .
Only one monoclonal antibody ( mAb H10E ) recognized the ligand-binding site of hMR [ 16 ] , but because H10E was elicited as an anti-idiotypic antibody against aldosterone , its usefulness has been somewhat limited .
New probes were required for functional studies of the structurally complex HBD .
We thus developed a new mAb ( 18C7 ) to that domain by immunizing mice with the glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -HBD fusion protein , which links GST with the 255-residue C-terminus of hMR from Thr'* to Lys®*** [ 9 ] .

They were exposed to autoradiography on Hyperfilm-MP ( Amersham ) at -70 °C .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Anti-HBD antibody production and characterization To direct the immunogenic response towards the hMR HBD , we immunized mice with the recombinant fusion protein GST-HBD , in which GST is linked to the 255 residues of HBD ( Thr `` **-Lys `` * ) , which was previously prepared in our laboratory [ 9 ] .
Among the several hybridomas producing antibodies detected by ELISA , one hybridoma ( mAb 18C7 ) reacted with the two fusion proteins GST-HBD and MBP-HBD , but not with GST and MBP , thus indicating that 18C7 is specific to the HBD .
The interaction of mAb 18C7 with denatured HBD was examined by immunoblot analysis .
mAb 18C7 recognized both the GST-HBD ( 55 kDa ; Figure 1 , lane 2 ) and MBP-HBD ( 70 kDa ; Figure 1 , lane 4 ) , but no bands were observed with GST or with MBP ( Figure 1 , lanes 3 and 5 respectively ) .
Some additional bands corresponding to unidentified degradation products were observed .
Because the high similarity in the HBD sequences of both hMR and human GR ( hGR ) was responsible for strong cross-reactivities between the two receptors , we tested the antibody reactivity towards hGR .
Immunoblot analysis provided evidence of 18C7 cross-reactivity with hGR ( results not shown ) .
Several HBD fragments were produced ( see the Materials and methods section ) to fully localize the epitope recognized by 18C7 .
These fragments were HBD mutants deleted at the N-terminal end , at the C-terminal end or at both ends .
In agreement with the previously published results by Jalaguier et al .
[ 9 ] , none of these fragments was able to bind aldosterone or progesterone ( results not shown ) .
By immunoblot analysis , mAb 18C7 recognized only the fragments including the N-terminal region of 7 8 9 10 11 107 - » wi by 36.8 - » 27.2- » 19 =- » Figure 1 - Immunoblot analysis of recombinant MR fragments MR fragments were expressed as fusion proteins with GST or MBP , then subjected to SDS/PAGE ( 10 % ge ! )

60 S. Jalaguier and others Figure 2 - Immunodetection of MR In rabbit kidney cortex by 18C7 Sections were immunostained with mAb 18C7 as described in the Materials and methods section .
In kidney cortex immunostaining was observed along the collecting tubules ( CT ) ( A ) , with no staining in the glomerulus ( GL ) ( B ) .

fragments Thr'* % -Glu® `` *° ( Figure 1 , lane 7 ) , Thr `` * `` *-Gly* `` ( Figure 1 , lane 8 ) and Thr'*-Leu*** ( Figure 1 , lane 10 ) .
The antibody did not react with fragments including the C terminal region of the HBD , e.g .
Leu `` `` *-Lys®* ( Figure 1 , lane 6 ) and Leu**-Lys* ( Figure 1 , lane 11 ) .
It also did not recognize Leu ' `` *-Gly* `` ( Figure 1 , lane 9 ) , which includes the central region of the HBD .
These results highlighted the epitope recognized by mAb 18C:7 along the hMBR : it encompasses the N-terminal region of the HBD from Thr'* `` to Leu `` .
With an immunohistochemical technique , mAb 18C7 revealed immunoreactive structures in sections of rabbit kidney cortex .
As shown in Figure 2 ( A ) , hMR was detected in the collecting ducts but no immunostaining was observed in the proximal tubules or in the glomerulus ( Figure 2B ) .
The immunostaining distribution observed with 18C7 was in close agreement with that revealed by other anti-MR antibodies [ 13,19 ] .
Similar immunostaining was also obtained with rat kidney sections ( results not shown ) .
The ability of 18C:7 , an anti-human MR , to interact with both rabbit and rat MR demonstrated its interspecies cross-reactivity .
We further examined the labelling of hMR by 18C7 in transiently transfected COS-7 cells .
In the absence of ligand the receptor was strongly detected in the cytoplasm ( Figure 3B ) .
Under the conditions of our experiment , after 4 h of incubation of the cells with aldosterone , hMR was revealed by 18C:7 in the nucleus only , where the receptor is supposed to be in its transformed DNA-bound state ( Figure 3C ) .
A similar effect was observed after 4 h of incubation with the antagonist progesterone ( Figure 3D ) .
Under these experimental conditions , 18C7 confirmed that hMR is functionally involved in nuclear translocation of the mineralocorticoid agonist ( aldosterone ) and antagonist ( progesterone ) .
Our results are in total agreement with those of Robertson et al .
[ 13 ] , even though Lombés et al .
[ 14 ] established that the intracellular distribution of hMR expressed in High Five cells was differentially regulated by aldosterone and anti-mineralocorticoids .
Influence of mAb 18G7 on steroid binding It was previously demonstrated that the hMR expressed in vitro in reticulocyte lysate had steroid-binding properties identical with those of the native receptor [ 11,20 ] .
The effect of mAb 18C:7 on steroid binding was examined by using the recombinant full Figure 3 Immunocytochemical locallzation of hMR transfected Into GCOS-7 cells pRShMR-transfected COS-7 cells were incubated for 4 h in the absence ( B ) or presence of 100 nM aldosterong ( G ) or 100 nM progesterone ( D ) .

Bound and free steroid were separated by the dextran-charcoal technique .
Results are means of four separate experiments and expressed as a percentage of specific [ PHJhormone binding measured in the absence of antibody .
hMR expressed in a reticulocyte lysate coupled transcription-translation system .
In our experiments two incubation conditions were examined : the steroid ( agonist or antagonist ) was incubated with hMR either before or after incubation with 18C7 .
hMR was first incubated with 10 nM [ *HJaldosterone for 4 h at 4°C and the aldosterone-hMR complex was subsequently incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with increasing amounts of mAb 18C7 .
The antibody was able to displace [ *HJaldosterone binding in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 4 ) .
At 1 4M 18C7 , 20 % of the bound radioactivity was displaced from the complex .
A similar result was obtained when both hormone and antibody were incubated simultaneously with the receptor ( results not shown ) .
When hMR was incubated with increasing concentrations of 18C7 before incubation with [ *HJaldosterone , the antibody inhibited aldosterone binding .
The percentage inhibition of bound radioactivity was dependent on the antibody concentration .
In these conditions , 1 18C7 was able to prevent [ *HJaldosterone binding with 82 % efficiency of inhibition ( Figure 4 ) .
A similar effect of 18C7 was observed on progesterone binding .
When hMR was first incubated with 18C7 and then with 10 nM steroid binding was inhibited by the antibody in a dose-dependent manner .
Figure 4 shows that a maximum inhibitory effect of 75 % was induced by 1 wM 18C7 .
These results indicate that when incubated with hMR , mAb 18C7 was able to block the access of both aldosterone and progesterone to their binding site in a similar fashion .
Sucrose density gradient analysis The ability of mAb 18C7 to interact with native hMR was further determined by sucrose density gradient analysis in the presence of sodium tungstate , which is known to stabilize the hetero-oligomeric MR form [ 5 ] .
Figure 5 shows that the tungstate-stabilized hMR labelled with 10 nM [ *HJaldosterone sedimented as a 10.5 S entity .

Sedimentation markers are indicated : aldolase ( a , 7.9 S ) and BSA ( b , 4.6 S ) .
decrease in the bound radioactivity could be detected whatever the amount of 18C7 .
However , when the incubation conditions were changed ( 18C7 was first incubated with hMR and then with [ *HJaldosterone ) , a slight decrease ( 30 % ) in bound radioactivity was observed ( results not shown ) .
These results indicate that the antibody did not co-sediment with the [ *HJaldosterone-MR complex .
They also suggest that 18C7 was partly able to block the access of aldosterone to its binding site .
In the above experiments , the liganded hMR was detected by using [ *HJaldosterone as tracer .
To favour the concomitant detection of both the unliganded and liganded forms of the receptor , hMR was metabolically labelled with [ **S } methionine during its expression in the lysate system .
The gradient profiles shown in Figure 6 ( A ) indicate that the unliganded [ *SJhMR sedimented at 10.5 S. After incubation with 18C:7 , the peak was shifted at 11.5 S , demonstrating that 18C7 co-sedimented with native unliganded hMR .
Figure 6 ( A ) also shows that the sedimentation profile of the aldosterone-liganded [ *SJhMR matched that of the unliganded hMR with a sedimentation coefficient of 10.5 S. Sedimentation of [ **SIhMBR in the presence of both aldosterone and 18C7 was then evaluated by incubating the antibody first and then the steroid .

Gradients were centrifuged for 15 h at 180.000 g in a SW41 rotor at 4 °C .

observed at approx .
11.5 S and 10.5 S ( Figure 6B ) , indicating the presence of two simultaneous complexes .
In the presence of progesterone , 18C7 had a similar effect on hMR : a large shoulder encompassing both forms of the com-plexed receptor was observed at approx .
11 S ( results not shown ) .
These overall results indicate that 18C7 was able to compete for the aldosterone-binding site , as well as for that of progesterone .
Covalent cross-linking As the association of hsps such as hsp90 with hMR is required for a competent steroid-binding site [ 6,9 ] , it was necessary to determine whether 18C7 acted directly on the steroid-binding site or through hsp binding .
hMR and its associated proteins were thus covalently linked and the effect of 18C7 on steroid binding was examined by gradient analysis .
We covalently cross-linked the receptor-associated proteins on with DMP , an irreversible cross-linking reagent that was demonstrated to promote covalent binding between the chick MR and hsp90 without altering aldosterone binding [ 5 ] .
To verify the efficiency of coupling in our assays , a parallel experiment was conducted with the hsp-deprived transformed hMBR state .
The gradient analyses were performed in the presence of sodium molybdate , which allows hMR transformation at high salt concentrations ( 0.4 M KCI ] ) [ 5 ] .
Under low salt conditions ( Figure 7A ) , the molybdate-stabilized [ * `` SJhMR sedimented at 10 S. After treatment with DMP , the cross-linked hMR sedimented at the same position ( results not shown ) .
When the cross-linked hMR was subsequently incubated with 18C7 , the peak shifted from 10 S to 118 .
This shift was identical with that observed after the incubation of untreated hMR with 18C7 .
Under high salt conditions ( 0.4 M KCI ; Figure 7B ) , the non-cross-linked hMR incubated with 18C7 sedimented at 8.8 S , whereas the cross-linked hMR , after incubation with 18C:7 , had 10x [ °°SIMR bound ( d. p. m. ) 04 0.6 0.8 Ae Figure 7 mAb 18C7 reacts with the cross-linked MR synthesized /n vifro , was incubated in TEG containing 20 mM sodium molybdate in the absence ( Q ) or presence of 20 asl of 18C7 ( ) .
After treatment with DMP , [ °°SJhMR was incubated with 20 w !

A 100 pl aliquot was layered on top of a 5-25 % ( w/v ) sucrose gradient prepared in TEGMo buffer .
( B ) Sample aliquots were incubated as in ( ) but in the presence of 0.4 M KCI .
The samples were analysed on sucrose gradients containing molybdate and 0.4 M KCI .
Gradients were centrifuged for 15 h at 180000 g in a SW41 rotor at 4 °C .
Sedimentation markers are indicated : catalase ( c , 11.3 S ) , aldolase ( a , 7.9 S ) and BSA ( b , 4.6 S ) .
shifted to form a large peak at approx .
10.5 S. As a control for the transformation process , the non-cross-linked hMR was analysed under high salt conditions .
No peak could be detected in the area because of the large amount of free [ ®SImethionine .
Fractions corresponding to the 10.5 S peak , the 8.8 S peak and the masked area at approx .
4-5 S were then analysed by autoradiography after SDS/PAGE ( Figure 8 ) .
Fractions 5-15 ( peak at 10.5 S ) migrated as a 250 kDa entity , which corresponded well to the hMR cross-linked with hsps .
Fractions 10-16 ( peak at 8.8 S ) mainly migrated at 110 kDa , indicating that it was the transformed form of the receptor that was recognized by 18C:7 .
Fractions 12-20 migrated as a major 110 kDa entity ( peak at approx .
58 according to the auto-radiograph pattern ) , indicating the presence of the transformed hMBR state .
These results indicate that 18C7 recognition of hMR was not hindered by cross-linked proteins such as hsps .
They also demonstrate that 18C7 was able to react with the 4 S transformed hMBR state .
The overall results of the present study demonstrate that the new mAb described in this paper ( 18C:7 ) , raised against the HBD of h MBR , recognized both the denatured and native hMR forms .
It also reacted with both the hetero-oligomeric 10 S $ structure of the receptor as well as the transformed 4 S state .
It then provided an important tool for direct examination of the HBD structure and function .
When the effect of the antibody was tested on hormone binding , 18C:7 seriously impaired both aldosterone and progesterone binding .
When incubated before the steroid , mAb 18C7 was able to prevent 75-80 % of hormone binding to hMR .
Furthermore the sucrose density gradient analysis revealed the concomitant presence of two complexes with hMR : the steroid hMR complex and the antibody-hMR complex .
The presence of a ternary complex steroid-hMR-antibody was ruled out by the fact that 18C7 did not co-sediment with the liganded [ *HJaldosterone-hMR .

clearly demonstrate that the 18C7 epitope , located in the N-terminal part of the HBD , is directly involved in steroid binding .
It is now agreed that the hormone-binding pocket of steroid receptors is made up of residues from throughout the HBD .
Furthermore it had been previously suggested that aldosterone and spironolactone bound to a common site [ 21 ] .
These hypotheses are strengthened by our present study .
Indeed , the three HBD mutants with the N-terminal sequence deleted were unable to bind aldosterone or progesterone .
These results demonstrate clearly that the Thr* `` `` -Leu `` `` `` sequence is part of a module involved in the joint binding of agonists and antagonists .
Recently , Wurtz et al .
[ 22 ] proposed a canonical structure for the ligand-binding domain of the whole nuclear receptor family : the anti-parallel « -helical sandwich .
From their report , six helices ( H3 to H5 and H8 to H10 ) form the core of the ligand-binding domain of retinoic acid receptors .
As a comparison with this model , the hMR sequence Thr'* `` -Leu `` `` includes helix H1 , the loop between H1 and H3 , and the first three amino acids of helix H3 .
Although not directly implicated in the six helices constituting the core binding site , this region encompasses H1 , which is supposed to be involved in key contacts with the ligand-binding core through five amino acid residues ( Leu , Glu `` , Ne `` , Glu `` and Ne `` ) .
In addition to H1 , the hMR sequence Thr'**-Leu `` * `` also comprises the loop between H1 and H3 , which is probably involved in bending H3 during ligand binding .
It would now be interesting to determine whether the site recognized by 18C7 is involved in the receptor conformation or whether there are direct contacts with the steroid .
