Oxidized low density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ) is inflammatory and signals through PPARs .
We showed , by phospholipase A , digestion , that PPARy agonists in oxLDL arise from the small pool of alkyl phosphatidylcholines in LDL .
We identified an abundant oxidatively fragmented alkyl phospholipid in oxLDL , hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine ( azPC ) , as a high affinity ligand and agonist for PPARy .
[ °HJazPC bound recombinant PPARy with an affinity ( Kd ( ﬂpp ) ~40 nM ) that was equivalent to rosiglitazone ( BRL49653 ) , and competition with rosiglitazone showed that binding occurred in the ligand-binding pocket .
azPC induced PPRE reporter gene expression , as did rosiglitazone , with a half-maximal effect at 100 ny .
Overexpression of PPARa « or PPARy revealed that azPC was a specific PPARy agonist .
The scavenger receptor CD36 is encoded by a PPRE-responsive gene , and azPC enhanced expression of CD36 in primary human monocytes .
We found that anti-CD36 inhibited azPC uptake , and it inhibited PPRE reporter induction .
Results with a small molecule phospholipid flippase mimetic suggest azPC acts intracellularly and that cellular azPC accumulation was efficient .
Thus , certain alkyl phospholipid oxidation products in oxLDL are specific , high affinity extracellular ligands and agonists for PPARy that induce PPAR-responsive genes .

PPARy , like other members of the broad nuclear hormone receptor family , undergoes a conformational change when it binds specific lipid ligands .
This structural reorganization alters its associated proteins , releasing transcriptional inhibitors and recruiting transcriptional co-activators .
The regulation of PPARy function is therefore controlled by lipid ligand binding .
A number of synthetic ligands for PPAR are known .
One of these , rosiglitazone ( BRL49653 ) , binds with high affinity and is widely prescribed as an insulin sensitizer in type II diabetes .
However , defining relevant biologic ligands has been problem-atic .
Several oxidatively modified fatty acids bind and activate PPARy , including 15-deoxy-A `` * `` *-prostaglandin J ; ( 15-deoxy-PGJ , ; ) , other arachidonate metabolites ( 2 , 3 ) , the linoleate derivatives 9-HODE and 13-HODE ( 4 ) , and several free fatty acids ( 5 , 6 ) .
However , none of these are particularly potent agonists , and for some their presence at concentrations sufficient to activate PPARy can be questioned .
For example , the oxygenated fatty acid products described above do not confer much advantage in potency over activation by free arachidonate ( 7 ) where a concentration of several micromolar is required to elicit a response .
Moreover , the 9- and 13-HODEs and their peroxides found in oxidized LDL ( 8 ) or in skin exposed to the tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate ( 9 ) are esteri-fied , yet only the free forms of these lipids , and not the intact phospholipids from these sources , are PPAR ligands ( 10 ) .
Additionally , it is unlikely that the PPARy and PPARa agonist 15-deoxy-PGJ , ( 2 , 3 ) accumulates in vivo , and it now appears that little 15-deoxy-PGJ ; is actually present in commercial sources of this reactive and unstable lipid ( 11 ) .
Oxidation of LDL creates unknown PPARy agonists ( 10 ) .
This process also creates PPARa « ligands ( 12 , 13 ) , the bulk of which depend on liberation by phospholipase A ; to free fatty acid oxidation products ( 13 ) .
PPARa « alters lipid metabolism , enhances lipid oxidation , and often dampens inflammatory events and signaling pathways ( 14 , 15 ) .
PPARy has a distinct profile of activities as it promotes adipogenesis through differentiation of preadipocytes , and it may have a complex role in atherogenesis ( 1 , 16 ) .
In part , its pro-atherogenic effects may occur through the formation of foam cells by stimulating CD36 expression ( 17 , 18 ) .
CD36 is a member of the scavenger receptor family that promotes the uptake of oxidized LDL , driving macrophages to a lipid-surfeit state characterized by foamy fatty inclusions .
Cells in atherosclerotic lesions express PPARy ( 19 , 20 ) , and buffered saline ; PAF , platelet-activating factor ; PC , phosphatidylcho-line ; FITC , fluorescein isothiocyanate .
16015 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 16016 CD36 is induced by PPARy agonists present in oxidized LDL ( 10 , 18 ) .
CD36 ligation and internalization of LDL particles oxidized by monocytes is blocked by an excess of oxidized phospholipids ( 21 ) , suggesting that one or more oxidized phospholipids is a CD36 ligand responsible for the internalization of oxLDL .
Here we show that a complex lipid ( .e .
a phospholipid ) formed by oxidative attack on a subclass of LDL phospholipids is effectively internalized by CD36 and is a high affinity , selective PPARy ligand and agonist .
Alkyl phosphatidylcholines , which consist of a small portion of the LDL phosphatidylcholine pool ( 22 ) , are the sole precursors for these agonists because there is selectivity for the bond in both binding and PPRE reporter activation .
We conclude that certain oxidized alkyl phospholipids define a new class of high affinity agonists for and because these are found in oxidized LDL , they may contribute to its biologic effects .

Oxidation and Analysis of LDL and Synthetic Phospholipids-LDL was oxidized with 20 um CuSO , at 37°C overnight , and oxidized phospholipids were purified by RP-HPLC ( 26 ) .
A portion of the recovered fractions was treated with phospholipase A , as before ( 27 ) , exec-ept that the enzyme was from Sigma .
The lipid azPC was synthesized from 1-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( hexadecyl lyso-PC ; after mild alkaline hydrolysis ; 0.5 N NaOH in methanol ; 4 h ; 24 °C ) and ( palmitoyl azela-oy1-PC ) was synthesized in a similar fashion from palmitoyl lyso-PC .
After neutralization , purified lipid ( 2 mg ) was reacted with 10 mg of azelaic anhydride ( University of Utah Chemical Synthesis Facility ) in the presence of 1 mg of 4- ( N , N-dimethylamino ) pyridine in ine ( 4:1 ) for 36 h before purification by RP-HPLC .
The mass of each synthetic phospholipid was determined by phosphorus analysis ( 28 ) .
Mass spectroscopy of lipid oxidation products was performed as before ( 27 ) .
[ PH ] Hexadecy ] azelaic phosphatidylcholine was synthesized from ( PerkinElmer Life Scienc-es ) and HPLC-purified in a similar fashion .
Cell Preparation-Human monocytes were isolated by counter-cur-rent elutriation ( 29 ) and resuspended ( 1 X 10°/ml ) in Hanks ' balanced salt solution with 0.5 % human serum albumin and 10 ug/ml polymyxin B. Monocytes were added to plates coated with 10 ug/ml CAL3.10 anti-ICAM-3 monoclonal antibody ( 80 ) .
CV-1 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown as suggested .
Surface expression of CD36 on primary human monocytes was determined by allowing elutriated monocytes to adhere to anti-ICAMS-coated wells for 1 h before the cells were exposed to the lipid agonists , or not , as stated in the figures .
Some cells were maintained in a suspended state by gently rocking on a platform rocker in polypropylene tubes as a control .
Adherent cells were released from the plate by gentle agitation and scraping and washed three times in PBS containing 1 % goat serum .
Recovered cells were stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD36 antibody CLB-IVC ?
7 for flow analysis by the University of Utah flow analysis core facility .
Plasmids-The acyl-CoA oxidase-luciferase plasmid was described previously ( 81 ) .
Plasmids were transformed into TOP1OF ' Escherichia coli strain using the TA cloning kit .
Plasmids from log phase cells were Oxidized Phospholipids Are PPARy Ligands isolated using a Bigger Prep kit ( 5 Prime - > 3 Prime , Inc. , Boulder , CO ) , and purified by CsCl gradients .
The His-tagged PPARy was constructed similarly using the M13 primer in pCR2.1 that contained full-length PPARy1 and a primer ( 5'-CTA ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG GTA CAA GTC CTT GTA G-3 ' ) containing the His , tag sequence .
PPARy and PPARa expression plasmids were a gift from Beth Meade ( University of Utah ) .
Inserts in all plasmids were sequence-verified by the University of Utah sequencing core facility .
Transfection of Cultured Cells and Reporter Assays-When PPAR expression plasmids were co-transfected with a reporter construct , 0.5 ug of the relevant plasmid was combined with 1 ug of pGL3-PPRE and 0.1 ug of the SV40-B-galactosidase reporter to normalize transfection efficiencies .
All transfections included 1-2 ug of total plasmid , and 5-10 ul of LipofectAMINE per ml of Opti-MEM .
Transfection solution was added to CV-1 cells overnight and then removed , and agonist was added in fresh media for 18-20 h. [ °H|Rosiglitazone displacement from PPARy was determined with a carboxy His , -tagged molecule .
Helia cells were transfected with pCR8.1-PPARy-His , or pCR8.1 for 21 h with LipofectAMINE and then grown ( 48 h ) .
The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in PBS containing 0.1 % Triton X-100 and frozen at -70°C until used .
Transfection with PPARy-His , was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-His , antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Debris was removed from thawed samples , and 200 ul of lysate was incubated with 50 pl of Probond beads at 4 °C for 1 h in PBS .
The beads were washed once by centrifugation before [ *H ] rosiglitazone , and then unlabeled competitor was added in a final volume of 800 ul of PBS .
Samples were incubated with shaking for 3 h at 4 °C before washing three times with PBS and quantitating retained `` H. Binding of phosphatidylcholine to PPARy was performed in a similar fashion , although the amount of protein lysate was increased to account for its lower specific radioactivity .
Accumulation of [ °HJazPC was estimated by incubating monolayers with carrier-free [ °HJazPC ( 22.9 Ci/ mmol ) for 30 min in the presence or absence of the lipids specified in the figure at a concentration of 10 uM ( except HPLC fraction 6 from oxLDL that was used at a concentration that maximally induced ACox reporter expression since there was insufficient material for phosphorus quan-titation ) .
Some cells were preincubated for 30 min with 10 ug of the blocking anti-CD86 antibody 185-1G2 or an irrelevant IgG2Za isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody .
RESULTS Oxidized Alkyl Phosphatidylcholines in Oxidized LDL Stimulate Luciferase Expression Under the Control of the Acyl-CoA Oxidase PPRE-We oxidized human LDL , extracted the lipids , and separated nonpolar lipids ( which we found to have no activity in this assay ; not shown ) from the polar phospholipid oxidation products .
We separately examined these polar phos-pholipid-containing fractions as agonists using CV-1 cells that had been transiently transfected with an acyl-CoA oxidase PPRE-firefly luciferase reporter construct and SV40-B-galactosidase to normalize for transfection efficiency .
These purified polar phospholipids stimulated luciferase transcription under the control of this PPRE ( Fig .
1 ) , and this activity was concentrated in RP-HPLC fraction 6 .
We found this material to be as effective an agonist for PPAR-induced transcription as rosiglitazone ( BRL49653 ) , and a synthetic oxidized phospholipid ( azPC ) is discussed in detail below .
Fig .
1 shows that an equivalent fraction from the same batch of LDL that had not been oxidized contained little stimulatory activity .
Oxidation of LDL creates oxidized phosphatidylcholines that are potent inflammatory agents because they structurally resemble PAF and activate the cloned receptor for PAF .
Oxidized phospholipids of this class are all derived from the small pool of alkyl phosphatidylcholines in LDL ( 22 ) that are resistant to phospholipase A ; , digestion ( 27 ) .
To determine whether the oxidatively generated agonists that induce transcription from a PPRE reporter construct also fall into this class , we digested the fractions isolated by HPLC with phospholipase A ; .
This removes the oxidized diacyl phospholipids , derived from the 99.5 % of LDL phospholipids that have an sm-1 ester bond , as assessed by phosphorus analysis ( not shown ) .

1. oxLDL contains PPRE agonists that are resistant to phospholipase A , digestion .
CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter under the control of the PPRE from acyl-CoA oxidase and an SV40-B-galactosidase plasmid to normalize transfection efficiency .
These cells were then treated for 18 h with buffer , 1 uM rosiglitazone ( Rost ) ( BRL49653 ) , 1 uM of the synthetic oxidized phospholipid azPC , or equivalent volumes of HPLC fractions of lipids extracted from native or oxidized ( Ox ) human LDL .
Each reporter was then assayed as described under `` Experi-mental Procedures `` and their ratio calculated .
Polar phospholipids contained in Cu `` -oxidized LDL were purified by RP-HPLC , and the fractions eluting at min 6-8 were collected ; the solvent was removed by a stream of N ; ; and the remaining lipids were resuspended in Hanks ' balanced salt solution/A by a brief sonication .
Polar phospholipid oxidation products with PAF-like activity elute at min 5 and 6 and PAF elutes in fraction 7 ( 27 ) in this system .
An aliquot of the polar phospholipids isolated from oxidized LDL was treated with phospholipase A ; and re-extracted prior to inclusion in the assay .
Data are presented as the range of two determinations and represent results of two separate experiments .
16017 stimulate luciferase expression from the PPRE-reporter construct ( Fig .
1 ) , indicating that only alkyl phosphatidylcholine oxidation products were effective agonists in this assay .
Azelaoyl Phosphatidylcholine Is a Prominent Oxidation Product in Oxidized LDL-We determined which alkyl phosphatidylcholine oxidation products were present in oxidized LDL by resolving the phospholipase A , -treated phospholipids by reversed phase HPLC and examining these by electrospray tandem mass spectroscopy as precursors of the phosphocholine ion m/z 184 .
An abundant ion in the HPLC effluent was observed at m/z 652 ( Fig .
20 ) , potentially corresponding to 1-O-hexadecyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( azPC ) .
This component was maximal in RP-HPLC fraction 6 ( Fig .
2 , inset ) , whereas the C , -PAF analogs were most abundant in fractions 7 and 8 , as reported previously ( 27 ) .
A structurally unique diagnostic product of sm-2 ©-carboxyl glycerophosphocholine lipids is the collision-induced rearrangement of a methyl group and decomposition to a monomethyl acid and dimethyl lyso-PC ( 82 ) .
Proof that azPC was present was obtained by collision-induced decomposition of the corresponding [ M - HJ~ of m/z 650 ( Fig .
2b ) that yielded the expected product ions at m/z 201 and 466 corresponding to monomethyl azelaic acid and the dimethyl lyso-PAF adduct resulting from the loss of the sm-2 methylazelaoyl ketene .
azPC is therefore an abundant oxidation product of LDL alkyl phosphatidylcholines .
We confirmed this deduction by synthesizing azPC and finding that synthetic azPC produced the same fragmentation pattern as the material isolated from oxidized LDL ( not shown ) .

3. azPC is a high affinity ligand for PPARy .
a , [ *HJazPC binds to immobilized full-length PPARy .
Lysates were prepared from HeLa cells transiently transfected with plasmid pCR3.1-PPARy-His , or pCR3.1 , and the ectopic protein from the stated amount of lysate was immobilized on Ni* beads .
Charged or uncharged beads were incubated with [ °H ] azPC before the beads were recovered and washed , and associated radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting .
6 , [ ®HJazPC binding to immobilized PPAR as a function of azPC concentration .
hPPARy , -His , immobilized on Ni* beads was incubated with the stated concentration of azPC before bound material was quantitated as above .
The range of duplicate points from 1 of 8 representative experiments is presented .
c , direct comparison of [ °HJazPC and [ *HJ ] ro-siglitazone binding at low concentrations .
The amount of carrier-free or whose concentrations were calculated from their specific radioactivity , retained by immobilized PPARy , -His , was determined as in the above experiments .
whether a complex lipid like azPC could function as a ligand for PPARy .
We synthesized [ °HJhexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine ( [ °HJazPC ) and incubated it with full-length recombinant human PPARy , ; .
The PPARy in transfected Hela cell lysates was immobilized on Ni * beads through an introduced His , tag , so tight binding could be assessed after collecting and washing the beads .
We found ( Fig .
30 ) that [ °HJazPC bound to PPARy , and that this binding was dependent on the concen- Oxidized Phospholipids Are PPARy Ligands tration of immobilized hPPARy ; , .
We next varied the concentration of [ °HJazPC to establish its apparent affinity for PPARy under these conditions .
We found that the binding of [ ®HJazPC was concentration-dependent and that its apparent affinity was ~40 nm ( Fig .
3b ) .
However , we also found that different lysates provided different apparent affinities , perhaps reflecting a similar wide disparity in reported apparent affinities for rosigitazone ( 2 , 33 , 34 ) .
To determine better whether azPC bound PPARy as effectively as rosigitazone , we directly compared PHJazPC binding with [ 3H ] rosig1itazone binding at low concentrations and found ( Fig .
3¢ ) that [ °HJazPC binding precisely mirrored the binding of [ °H } rosiglitazone to immobilized PPARy1 .
Synthetic azPC Interacts with the Ligand-binding Pocket of PPARy-Rosiglitazone co-crystallizes with the ligand-binding domain of PPARy ( 35 , 36 ) in the ligand-binding pocket , so displacement of [ °HJrosiglitazone tests binding in this pocket .
We found ( Fig .
40 ) that azPC displaced the standard ligand [ PHJrosiglitazone in a concentration-dependent fashion and that the concentration relationship of this competition was identical to that of unlabeled rosiglitazone .
azPC bound PPARy only through this ligand-binding pocket because this competition with rosiglitazone was complete .
We examined the effect of other lipids as competitors at 6.7 uM where azPC and rosiglitazone competition was complete and found ( Fig .
45 ) that PAF and 15-deoxy-PGJ ; , could only displaced about a third of the [ PHJrosiglitazone at this concentration .
Free azelaic acid , like arachidonate , was an ineffective competitor .
We performed the converse experiment where unlabeled rosiglitazone or azPC was used to displace [ PHJazPC bound to immobilized PPARy .
We found ( Fig .
4¢ ) that unlabeled rosiglitazone displaced nearly all of the [ PHJazPC from PPARy as its concentration was increased , just as unlabeled azPC displaced this bound [ °HJazPC .
We tested other lipids for their ability to displace [ °HJazPC and found ( Fig .
4d ) that PAF , and to a lesser extent lyso-PAF , was a modest competitor , but that 9-HODE or 13-HODE were unable to displace bound [ PHJazPC .
We tested palmitoyl azelaoyl-PC , the diacyl homolog of hexadecyl azelaoyl PC , as a PPARy ligand , and we found it to be 10-100-fold less potent as a competitor ( not shown ) .
azPC Is a Potent Agonist for PPAR-responsive Elements-azPC was a ligand for PPARy , so we next determined whether it was an agonist .
We transfected CV-1 cells with a luciferase reporter under the control of the PPRE from acyl-CoA oxidase , along with SV40-§-galactosidase as a transfection control , and then treated the cells with rosiglitazone , synthetic azPC , or 9-cis-retinoate to activate RXR .
Rosiglitazone induced a 3.4-fold increase in reporter expression , and azPC induced a 3.9-fold increase ( Fig .
5a ) in this assay .
Fig .
1 presented a similar result where azPC induced a 3.9-fold increase in ACox reporter expression .
Activation of just the RXR subunit with 9-cis-retinoate , which can act as a phantom ligand ( 37 ) , was not as effective as either PPARy ligand in stimulating reporter expression .
We compared the concentration-response relationship of azPC and its acyl analog with rosiglitazone as PPARqy agonists .
CV-1 cells were transfected with the ACox reporter and SV40-B-galactosidase for normalization , and we then treated with increasing concentrations of azPC , diacyl azPC , or rosiglitazone .
We found that azPC induced a concentration-dependent increase in reporter expression starting by about 10~® x ( Fig .
5b ) .
Half-maximal activation occurred by 10 ~ `` mM , and maximal expression was achieved by 1 um .
Rosiglitazone also induced a concentration-dependent increase , and this relationship was identical to that of azPC .
We also examined the diacyl homolog of azPC , 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sm-glycero-3-phosphocholine , 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Oxidized Phospholipids Are PPARy Ligands a ; b azPC 6 - = === Rosi n 0 5 4 po-o / ” \/\/\/\/ < 0_ [ BH ] Rosi Retained ( dpm x 10° ) t | Relative Rosi Displacement ( % ) 0 T I 0 5 10 Competitor ( x1 o-6 M ) C 7 d === azPC _L 6 === « Rosi be = x g 5 o.

4. azPC competes for rosiglitazone ( Rosi ) binding in the PPAR » ligand-binding pocket .
a , azPC displacement of [ *H } rosiglitazone from PPARy .
( 0.33 nM ) was mixed with the stated concentration of unlabeled rosiglitazone or azPC before the amount of retained by immobilized PPARy was determined .
An excess ( 18.6 uM ) of unlabeled rosiglitazone in these transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lysates reduced binding to the level of untransfected cells .
b , azPC is a preferred PPARy ligand .
Competitive displacement of [ ®HJrosiglitazone from Ni*-bound PPARy was determined with an excess ( 6.7 pM ) of the stated compound .
c , azPC binds to immobilized PPARy and is equally displaced by rosiglitazone or unlabeled azPC .

as an agonist ; we found that it was about 100-fold less effective than azPC and only began to elicit an effect at 10 um .
azPC Is a Specific PPARy Agonist-We determined the spec-ificity of azPC as a PPARy agonist by transfecting CV-1 cells with PPARa « or PPARy expression plasmids in addition to the ACox reporter and an SV40 -galactosidase transfection control .
Rosiglitazone induced an 8-fold increase in reporter expression in this experiment ( Fig .
6 ) in untransfected cells that rely on their endogenous PPARs .
This was a more robust response than the 5.3-fold increase induced by the PPARa-selective agonist WY14643 or the 5-fold increase induced by azPC in these control cells .
When PPARy was overexpressed in these cells , the response to rosiglitazone was markedly enhanced ( a 25-fold induction ) , as was the response to azPC ( an 18-fold induction ) .
In contrast , overexpression of PPARa failed to enhance the existing response to either azPC or rosiglitazone .
The ectopic PPARa was functional because the PPARa-selective agonist WY14643 enhanced expression in cells overexpressing PPARa and not in cells transfected with PPARy .
CD36 Is Induced by azPC through Its PPRE-We determined whether endogenous PPAR-regulated genes were induced by azPC , and for this we chose CD36 , a scavenger receptor that binds and internalizes oxidized LDL particles .
Intriguingly , transcription of CD36 in monocytes is stimulated by unknown ligands associated with oxidized LDL ( 10 , 18 ) .
We exposed adherent primary human monocytes to rosiglitazone , and we found that it increased the surface expression of CD36 as expected ( Fig .
7a ) .
There was an equivalent enhancement of CD36 surface expression when monocytes were exposed to synthetic azPC .
Additionally , we found that HPLC fraction 6 of oxidized LDL was just as effective as azPC and rosiglitazone in enhancing CD36 surface expression .
Finally , we found that just adhesion and spreading of the monocytes in the absence of one of these ligands had no effect on surface CD36 expression .
We determined whether azPC stimulated CD36 transcription by using CD36 promoter-reporter constructs that either contained its PPRE at position -273 ( pCD36~* `` ° ) or lacked this element ( pCD36 *** ) .
We found ( Fig .
76 ) that rosiglitazone 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 16020 a 3 800 ml é 700 8 600-G E soo o Z & 400 K3 § soo § 200 % § 100 } \ < 0 Buffer Rosi azPC RA b 5 Rosi -=- azPC 47 -~ .

5. a , azPC fully stimulates reporter expression controlled by acyl-CoA oxidase PPRE .
CV-1 cells were transfected with the acyl-CoA-oxidase-PPRE-luciferase ( ACox ) reporter construct along with SV40-6-galactosidase to normalize transfection efficiency .
After 1 h of recovery , these cells were treated for 18 h with 200 nM rosiglitazone ( Rosi ) , 200 nM azPC , or 1 uM O-cis-retinoate ( RA ) .
Firefly luciferase and SV40-B-galactosidase activities in the cellular lysates were determined , and the data are presented as this normalized ratio .
b , azPC stimulation of normalized ACox-luciferase expression is concentration-dependent .
CV-1 cells were transfected with ACox-PPRE-luciferase and SV40-B-galactosidase and then stimulated for 24 h with buffer , or the stated amount of synthetic azPC , diacyl azPC , or rosiglitazone .
These are representative results from one of two experiments .

CV-1 cells were transfected with acyl-CoA oxidase-PPRE-luciferase and SV40-B-galactosidase without or with co-transfection with PPARa or PPARy expression plasmids .
These cells were then exposed to buffer , 1 uM rosiglitazone ( Rosi ) , or azPC , or 5 uM WY14648 for 24 h before the ratio of luciferase to B-galactosidase was determined as before .
These results are representative of two separate experiments .

This induction did not occur when we used pCD36 *** that lacked the PPRE .
We next co-transfected these cells with RXR , PPAR « , or both RXR and PPARa expression plasmids , and we found that forced expres- Oxidized Phospholipids Are PPARy Ligands sion of these nuclear hormone receptors did not substantially alter these results .
However , when the cells were co-transfected with PPARy , either alone or in combination with RXR , the induction of pCD36~* `` `` ° by rosiglitazone was markedly enhanced .
The response of the pCD36 ** reporter plasmid to azPC was equally augmented by overexpression of PPARy .
This augmentation only occurred when the reporter construct contained the PPAR-responsive element , so activation of PPARy , and not PPARa « , by azPC stimulates CD36 expression via this PPRE .
CD36 Aids in the Uptake of Extracellular azPC-CD36 translocates entire oxidized lipoprotein particles into cells , apparently by binding to incorporated oxidized phospholipids ( 21 ) .
We determined whether CD36 also transports extracellular oxidized phospholipids not incorporated into a lipoprotein particle .
We found that human monocytes accumulated PHJazPC and that this accumulation was reduced by excess unlabeled azPC or the polar phospholipids isolated from oxidized LDL ( Fig .
8a ) .
Excess PAF was less effective in blocking PHJazPC accumulation and inhibited about half of the PHJazPC accumulation .
The blocking anti-CD36 antibody 185-1G2 also blocked half of the specific accumulation of [ °H ] azPC , whereas an isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody had no effect .
We next transfected CV-1 cells with the ACox PPRE reporter plasmid and then treated the cells with the blocking anti-CD36 antibody prior to exposing these cells to azPC or the stimulatory polar phospholipids purified from oxidized LDL .
We found ( Fig .
8b ) that the inhibitory monoclonal antibody 185-1G2 effectively blocked the induction of the reporter in response to either azPC or the polar phospholipids isolated from oxidized LDL .
This effect did not extend to all lipids as luciferase expression in response to rosiglitazone was not inhibited by the monoclonal antibody .
Extracellular azPC Has Ready Access to Intracellular PPARy-Our results suggest that azPC is a direct agonist for PPARy , but it might be argued that azPC activates a surface receptor whose signal induces the synthesis of the true intracellular ligand for this nuclear receptor .
In this case , enhancing intracellular access of azPC should have no effect on reporter induction .
We tested this postulate with the small molecule flippase mimetic TTA ( Fig .
90 ) that facilitates anionic phospholipid flip-flop ( 24 ) .
We found that TTA had no effect of its own on ACox reporter expression in CV-1 cells ( not shown ) but that it doubled the 1.7-fold induction of the acyl-CoA oxidase reporter induced by azPC alone ( Fig .
9b ) .
This enhancement in azPC activity by TTA was concentration-dependent with little sign of toxicity up to 37 uM , the concentration used to study vesicular transport ( 24 ) .
This cationic lipid also doubled reporter expression when the extracellular agonist was an intact oxidized LDL particle ( Fig .
9¢ ) , suggesting that it can exchange agonists from these particles as well .
This is not the anticipated result if gene induction depended on signaling from an externally disposed plasma membrane receptor for azPC .
We conclude from this , first that the flippase mimetic aids azPC penetration into cells and thereby enhances transcription by nuclear PPARy .
Second , we conclude that because the enhancement was quite modest that azPC transport already occurs at a rate that supplies near-maximal amounts of extracellular azPC , or oxidized ligands in oxidized LDL particles , to intra- cellular PPARy .
DISCUSSION Our findings show that oxidatively modified phosphatidylcholines from oxidized LDL are high affinity ligands and agonists for PPARy .
We find that there is a distinct selectivity for an sn-1 ether bond in both binding to PPAR~y and its activation by oxidized phospholipids .

CD36 is induced by azPC through its PPRE .
a , azPC enhances CD36 surface expression in primary human monocytes .
Monocytes freshly isolated by elutriation were allowed to ad 120 Unactivated azPC Counts here to anti-ICAM8-coated wells and then incubated with buffer , 1 uM azPC , rosiglitazone ( Rosi ) , or with fraction 6 of HPLC-purified polar phospholipids derived from 120 C > : u 0 - 103 10 `` 2 103 10 `` 10 FL-1 Height 102 FL-1 Height oxidized LDL .
After overnight incubation , these cells were released from the plate 100 4 and stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD36 antibody CLB-IVC7 .
The upper left panel shows that adhesion alone was not stimulatory as CD36 expression by unactivated cells held in suspension was the 40 1 same as those allowed to adhere to anti-ICAMS-coated surfaces .
b , azPC stimulates CD36 transcription through a PPRE o 3 80 1 60 4 Counts Rosi OxLDL Fxn 6 Counts Agonist 4 Agonist idl and PPARy .
CV-1 cells were transfected with a CD36 promoter-luciferase reporter that contained its PPRE ( CD36~*'° ) or one that did not ( CD36- `` ° `` ) .
All cells were co-transfected with SV40-B-galactosidase , b aa o 10 `` 102 103 10 `` 102 103 FL1 Height FL-1 Height and some cells were additionally transfected with expression plasmids encoding RXRa , PPARa , or PPARy .
The cells were then treated for 16 h with 1 uM rosiglitazone or azPC before the ratio of luciferase to B-galactosidase was determined and normalized to buffer-treated cells .
These results are representative of a separate experiment .
Normalized Fold Increase 6 - mn @ a a o ~ o w ether bond means that the LDL precursors of these high affinity ligands are derived from the half percent or so of alkyl phosphatidylcholines in the pool of LDL phosphatidylcholine ( 22 ) .
One prominent oxidation product of this subclass was as potent as the synthetic high affinity ligand rosiglitazone .
PPARy is a ligand-dependent transcriptional activator where the known ligands are lipids with a remarkably wide range of structures .
Crystallography reveals a large hydropho-bic ligand cavity that is only 25-40 % occupied by rosiglitazone ( 35 , 36 ) , suggesting that a variety of structures might be able to be accommodated by this pocket .
azPC bound PPARy in a way that was saturable and was completely displaced by rosiglitazone .
This latter attribute strongly suggests that azPC binds in the ligand-binding pocket .
We did not established the K , , for azPC through a Scatchard analysis , because we do not have sufficient immobilized protein for quantitation , but rather have established its apparent binding constant .
The value we obtained for an apparent affinity of azPC for PPARy was around 40 nM , but we also found variation in this number using lysates from other transfections .
More relevant was our observation that in a direct comparison there was no discernible difference between [ 3H ] rosiglitazone and PHJazPC binding .
The affinity of rosiglitazone itself for PPARy is subject to variability in the literature ranging from 40 to 60 nM for the displacement of [ °H ] SB-236636 ( 88 ) to 200 nx for the displacement of [ 3H ] rosig1itazone ( 39 ) .
These competitive displacement values span the range of values reported for the actual binding constant for rosiglitazone to PPARy , where the K , ranges from 40 ( 83 ) to 100 ( 84 ) to 325 nm ( 2 ) .

However , not all polar alkyl phosphatidylcholines interact well with PPARy because PAF was a poor ligand that failed to induce PPRE reporter expression .
Nevertheless the sm-1 ether bond is an important structural determinant because the diacyl homolog of azPC was a poor ligand ( not shown ) and an even less effective agonist that only began to induce PPRE reporter function by 10 uM .
This selectivity for the sm-1 ether bond is the basis for our observation that phospholipase A , treatment of the mixed oxidized phospholipid products generated by LDL oxidation did not detectably reduce PPRE reporter activity .
The diacyl azPC analog will be formed in parallel with alkyl azPC during LDL oxidation ( 40 ) and in about 200-fold greater abundance ( 22 ) .
However , the results with phospholipase A ; show this numerical advantage still is not sufficient to contribute to PPARy activation by oxidized LDL .
When considering the importance of the sm-1 bond , it is important to note that commercial preparations of lysophosphatidylcholines , used in the preparation of diacyl phosphatidylcholines with specific sn-2 residues , are variably contaminated with alkyl species . ``
This can contribute to the apparent activation of PPARy by oxidized synthetic diacyl phosphatidylcholines , so the material we used to synthesize the diacyl homolog of azPC was first 2 G. K.

CD36 aids azPC accumulation and induction of ACox PPRE-driven transcription .
a , [ °H ] azPC accumulation is blocked by anti-CD86 antibody .
Monocytes were incubated with [ °HJazPC for 30 min without or with the addition of the stated lipids at a concentration of 10 pM .
Some cells were preincubated with 10 ug/ml blocking 185-1G2 anti-CD36 antibody or an isotype-matched IgG2a control antibody .
6 , inhibition of CD86 function inhibits azPC-induced PPRE-controlled luciferase expression .
CV-1 cells were transfected with ACox-luciferase and SV40-G-galactosidase as above and then treated with the CD36 blocking antibody 185-1G2Z prior to addition of 1 uM rosiglitazone ( Rosi ) , azPC , or intact oxidized LDL particles .
The fold induction of the normalized luciferase to B-galactosidase was determined as before , and this experiment represents the results of an independent experiment .
Oxidized Phospholipids Are PPARy Ligands purified to avoid this spurious effect .
Oxidation of LDL creates phosphatidylcholines with fragmented s » -2 residues , some with an « -carboxylate function ( 40 , 41 ) .
These oxidation products are found in human plasma ( 42 ) and atherosclerotic lesions ( 43 ) .
PPARy , in contrast to PPARa , is aberrantly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions ( 20 ) and co-lonic tumors ( 44 ) , which provide phospholipid oxidation products with the potential to alter the complement of genes expressed in such areas .
Certain synthetic diacyl phospholipid oxidation products modestly activate PPARa function ( 12 ) .
However , PPARa activation by oxidized phospholipids depends on phospholipase A , activity ( 13 ) , suggesting that the oxidized free fatty acid products of this reaction are the actual ligands for PPARa .
By contrast , we show PPARy to directly bind intact , and only intact , oxidized phospholipid .
The ability of azPC to drive PPRE-reporter constructs at submicromolar concentrations shows that it readily crosses cellular membranes , apparently with minimal metabolism , to selectively activate this nuclear receptor .
Uptake of the intact phospholipid was a property of CD36 .
CD36 is a type B scavenger receptor that can account for up to half the binding , internalization , and degradation of oxidized LDL by human macrophages ( 45 ) .
Expression of this receptor is induced by PPARqy agonists in oxidized LDL ( 10 , 18 ) .
CD36 recognizes the lipid portion of oxidized LDL ( 45 ) , and diacyl-oxidized phospholipids interfere with this uptake ( 21 ) , suggesting that CD36 binds phosphatidylcholine oxidation products .
Here we show that it also internalized at least one of them , and we find that azPC induction of nuclear transcription from the PPRE reporter was CD36-dependent .
We conclude that the synthetic oxidized phosphatidylcholine was transported as an intact molecule because any hydrolysis and resynthesis likely would have generated the inactive diacyl species from cellular lysophosphatidylcholine .
We determined whether azPC uptake was limiting using TTA , a lipophilic tridentate phosphate chelator ( 25 ) that increases the rate of anionic phospholipid flip-flop across unila-mellar vesicles ( 24 ) .
Our experiments represent the first use of this class of agents in living cells , and we found TTA to double reporter expression by azPC or intact oxidized LDL .
There were two notable results here .

The proposed interaction of TTA and azPC is based on the proposed interaction with lipid phos-phodiesters ( 24 , 25 ) .
TTA transports anionic phospholipids across membrane bi- a-layers ( 24 ) and should circumvent cellular transport mechanisms .
b , TTA affects azPC-induced gene expression .
CV-1 cells were transfected with the ACox-luciferase reporter and stimulated with 200 nM azPC as described in Fig .

c , TTA improves azPC and intact oxidized LDL induction of ACox-luciferase expression .
CV-1 cells were transfected with the ACox-luciferase reporter and treated with 200 nM azPC or an equivalent amount of oxidized LDL with or without the addition of 10 um TTA .
Luciferase was assayed as A-Cox Luciferase D Agonist 30 [ Z ] + Flippase 20 ( RLU x 103 ) 10 before , and an independent experiment 0 confirmed these findings .

This suggests that azPC , and lipids in oxidized LDL , directly activates PPARy rather than some secondary intracellular messenger produced after an initial interaction of azPC with an unknown surface receptor .
The second key observation was that TTA only doubled reporter activity .
If cellular uptake of exogenous azPC had been severely limiting , then circumventing this step should have markedly enhanced reporter induction .
Since it did not , it is fair to conclude that azPC entry into cells is relatively efficient .
Oxidative stress arises from a number of sources , from exuberant inflammatory reactions to ionizing radiation .
Reactive oxygen species and the oxidized LDL generated by them are postulated to initiate and maintain an inflammatory state in the vascular wall during atherogenesis ( 46-48 ) .
LDL oxidized ex vivo , like the oxidized particles obtained from atherosclerotic plaques ( 49 ) , contains inflammatory lipids that increase the atherogenicity of these particles .
Similarly , oxidized LDL in the circulation ( 42 , 50 ) or in atherosclerotic plaques ( 43 ) also contains fragmented and oxidatively modified phospholipids ( 26 , 40 , 43 ) .
Some of these are agonists for the PAF receptor ( 27 , 51 ) .
Here we show that others are high affinity ligands and activators of PPARy .
This establishes a new link connecting LDL oxidation with the induction of PPAR-regulated genes , and oxidized LDL ( 52 ) , fragmented phospholipids ( 43 ) , monocytes ( 53 ) , and PPARy ( 20 ) are all present in atherosclerotic lesions .
