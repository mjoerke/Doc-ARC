In this study , we analyzed the regulation of AP-1- and NF- « B-mediated transcription during in vivo induction of tolerance to a self Ag expressed exclusively on hepatocytes .
Naive CD8 * Désiré ( Des ) * T cells isolated from the Des TCR-transgenic mice that are specific for the H-2K `` class I Ag were transferred into Alb-K `` -transgenic mice that express the H-2K `` Ag on hepatocytes only .
Tolerance develops in these mice .
We found that the self-reactive CD8 *Des* T cells were transiently activated , then became unresponsive and were further deleted .
In contrast to CD8 *Des* T cells activated in vivo with APCs , which express high AP-1 and high NF-B transcriptional activity , the unresponsive CD8 *Des* T cells expressed no AP-1 and only weak NF-B transcriptional activity .
The differences in NF-sB transcriptional activity correlated with the generation of distinct NF- « B complexes .
Indeed , in vivo primed T cells predominantly express p50/p50 and p65/p50 dimers , whereas these p50-containing complexes are barely detectable in tolerant T cells that express p65- and c-Rel-containing complexes .
These observations suggest that fine regulation of NF-B complex formation may determine T cell fate .
The Journal of Immunology , 2001 , 166 : 4399-4407. tudies over the past few years have indicated a wide va riety of mechanisms that lead to peripheral T cell toler- ance .
Induction of T cell anergy , deletion of the autoreactive T cells usually preceded by a transient phase of activation , down-modulation of the TCR or coreceptor , and immune deviation have been described in several transgenic mice models ( 1-7 ) .
However , the parameters that determine the mechanisms of peripheral T cell tolerance are still fully unknown .
T cell activation requires two signals , the antigenic signal and a second signal resulting from the interaction of the costimulatory molecules B7.1 and B7.2 , expressed by activated APCs , and the CD28 receptor expressed by the T cell ( reviewed in Ref .
( 8 ) ) .
TCR ligation in the absence of a costimulatory signal is thought to induce T cell unresponsiveness , a mechanism that contributes to peripheral T cell tolerance ( 9 ) .
The signaling cascades triggered by coligation of the TCR and CD28 receptors lead to the activation of several transcription factors including AP-1 , NF-AT , and NF-KB , which are thought to be important in the different steps of T cell activation and may participate in T cell survival .

E-mail address : guerder @ ciml.univ-mrs.fr Copyright © 2001 by The American Association of Immunologists The AP-1 transcription factor is a complex between members of the Fos ( cFos , FosB , Fra-1 , and Fra-2 ) and Jun ( c-Jun , JunB , and JunD ) families of proteins ( 10 ) .
AP-1 transcriptional activity is regulated at the level of both fos and jun gene transcription and by post-transcriptional modifications of the corresponding protein , induced at least in part by CD28-dependent signaling ( 11 , 12 ) .
The AP-1 transcription factor regulates the expression of several cytokine genes and may participate in the control of cell cycle ( 10 , 13 ) .
The NF-KB family of transcription factors is composed of NF- « B1 ( p50/p105 ) , NF- « B2 ( p52/p100 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , c-Rel , and RelB , which upon homo- or heterodimerization bind to « B motifs ( reviewed in Ref .
( 14 ) ) .
NF- « B dimers are retained in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein of « B ( IxB ) , `` which , upon activation , is phosphorylated and degraded , thus releasing the NF-KB complexes that can translocate to the nucleus ( 14 ) .
The p65 and p50 molecules and c-Rel appear to be the essential regulators of « B sites in T cells .
The p65/p50 and p65/c-Rel heterodimers act as positive regulators of T cell activation and cytokine gene expression ( 15 , 16 ) .
The p50 molecule lacks the transactivation domain present in p65 and c-Rel , and p50/p50 homodimers may therefore be negative regulators of « B sites ( 14 ) .
NF-KB also plays a critical role in protecting cells from TNF- « @ -induced apoptosis ( 17-21 ) .
Similarly , NF- « B protects mature T cells from activation-induced apoptosis .
Indeed , mature CD4 * or CD8 * T cells isolated from a mouse transgenic for a frans-dominant I « Ba , which completely blocks the nuclear translocation of p65/p50 and c-Rel complexes , present an increased susceptibility to activation-induced apoptosis ( 22 , 23 ) .
NF-kB may also function as a proapoptotic factor for some cell lines and for thymocytes ( 24 ) .
Studies on the molecular mechanisms of CD4 * T cell anergy suggested that perturbed activation of AP-1 and NF- « B may lead to T cell unresponsiveness ( 25-27 ) .
Indeed , CD4+* T cells made anergic by repeated injection of the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A have reduced AP-1 and altered NF- « B complexes as compared with activated CD4* T cells ( 26 , 27 ) .

We therefore established a transfer model to directly analyze AP-1 and NF- « B transcriptional activity as tolerance develops .
Naive T cells isolated from the Désiré ( Des ) TCR-transgenic mice that are specific for the H-2K `` class I Ag were injected into Alb-K `` ® mice that express the H-2K `` transgene exclusively on hepatocytes ( 5 , 6 ) .
Tolerance is established in these mice .
We found that self-reactive CD8 * T cells were transiently activated , then became unresponsive and were further deleted .
The unresponsive T cells expressed no AP-1 and only weak NF-KB transcriptional activity .
This contrasts with T cells primed in vivo under conditions known to induce effector and memory T cells that express high AP-1 and NF- « B transcriptional activity .
The differences in transcriptional activity detected in the primed and unresponsive population correlated with differences in the NF- « B complexes generated , suggesting that fine regulation of NF- « B-dependent gene expression may determine the fate of autoreactive T cells .
Materials and Methods Mice The Alb-K `` mice are transgenic for the class I H-2K `` molecule driven by the albumin promoter and express H-2K `` on hepatocytes ( 6 ) .
The Des mice are transgenic for a TCR specific for the H-2K `` molecule ( 5 ) .
The AP-1-luciferase ( AP-1-Luc ) - and NF- « B-Luciferase ( NF- « B-Luc ) -transgenic mice contain the firefly luciferase gene , controlled by four AP-1 sites or two NF-KB sites , respectively ( 11 , 28 ) .
All mice were backcrossed for at least six generations on a B10.BR background .
The CBK-transgenic mice express the H-2K `` molecule on all hematopoietic cells ( 29 ) .
Adoptive transfer Alb-K®-transgenic mice or control B10.BR mice were thymectomized at the age of 4-6 wk , rested for 3-4 wk , and y-irradiated at 6 Gy .
After 11-15 days , the mice were injected i.v .
with 5-8 X 10° T cells purified from Des-transgenic mice .
The low dose of irradiation eliminates most circulating lymphocytes while sparing bone marrow precursors .
Reconsti-tution of the peripheral pool of lymphocytes by endogenous precursors was completed by the time of adoptive transfer .
Because the mice were thymectomized , only the B cell compartment but not the T cell compartment was replenished .
Indeed , the spleen of such manipulated mice contained , on average , 3 % CD4* T cells and 3 % CD8* T cells and , when adoptively transferred , 2-3 % CD8 *Des* T cells ( data not shown ) .
Abs and FACS staining FITC-labeled anti-CD25 , -CD44 , -CD62L , and -CD69 Ab and PE-labeled anti-CD4 and -CD8 Abs were purchased from BD PharMingen ( La Jolla , CA ) .
The Des anti-clonotype and H59.101.2 anti-CD8 Ab were prepared and biotinylated at the Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy .
For FACS staining , all samples were triple stained for the clonotype , CD4 or CD8 , and one activation marker .
In brief , 5 X 10° cells were incubated with biotinylated Des Ab , washed two times , and incubated with Strepta-vin-Tricolor ( Caltag , Burlingame , CA ) and FITC- and PE-conjugated Ab .
Cell preparation Lymph node T cells used for adoptive transfer were prepared by depletion of B cells using sheep anti-mouse IgG magnetic beads ( Dynal , Oslo , Nor-way ) .
On average , the population recovered contained < 5 % non-T cells and was composed of < 5 % CD4 * T cells , of which 50 % expressed the Des TCR , and ~80 % CD8* T cells , of which > 90 % were Des* .
When indi-cated , the cells were labeled with CFSE ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) as previously described ( 30 ) .
Purified CD8 * or Des * T cells were prepared by MACS ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) separation using either biotinylated anti-CD8 or Des Ab , dichlorotriazinylaminofluo-rescein-conjugated streptavidin ( Immunotech , Marseille , France ) , and MACS biotin-conjugated beads .
Purity of the recovered population was < 90 % .
To isolate liver-infiltrating cells , mice were perfused with PBS .
Livers were pressed through nylon mesh and passed over a Ficoll cushion .
In vitro activation T cell-depleted APCs were prepared by Ab-mediated complement lysis using an anti-Thy1.2 Ab ( JJ ) and y-irradiated at 24 Gy .
Four million responder spleen cells were stimulated with 2 X 10° APCs .
Before stimulation , the representation of CD8 *Des* T cells in the different spleen populations was determined by FACS analysis .
This value was used to normalize all samples and calculate the biologic activity of interest for 5 % 10° CD8 *Des* T cells .
Luciferase assays Cells were washed twice in PBS , then lysed in lysis buffer ( luciferase assay system ; Promega , Madison , WI ) , and luciferase activity was developed using the luciferase reagent ( Promega ) .
All measurements were done in duplicate .
The background measurement was always below the activity found in extracts from nonstimulated cells .
Experimental values expressed as relative luminescence units ( RLU ) were therefore calculated by subtracting the value of unstimulated samples from each sample .
To correct for the difference in CD8*Des* representation in the different samples , the experimental value for 5 X 10° CD8 *Des* T cells was calculated as indicated above .
Cytokine measurements IL-2 production was measured by bioassay using the CTLL-2 cell line as previously described ( 31 ) .
IFN-y production was measured by ELISA using the AN18 and biotinylated R46A2 Abs and alkaline phosphatase-con-jugated streptavidin ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) .
The amount of cytokine was expressed as units compared with a standard curve obtained with recom-binant cytokines and corrected for the representation of CD8 *Des * T cells in each sample as indicated above .
RNA preparation and RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted using the High Pure RNA Isolation kit ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) according to the manufacturer 's in-structions , treated with DNase I ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , and reverse transcribed using oligo ( dT ) ; 5 and SuperScript II RT ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) .
The cDNA was amplified using specific primers and Tag DNA polymerase ( Life Technologies ) .
All samples were normalized on the basis of expression of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase ( HPRT ) as previously described ( 32 ) .
Luciferase mRNA was quantified using as forward primer , 5-CGCGGAATACTTCGAAATGTC-3 ' , and reverse primer , 5'-CCTTAGGTAACCCAGTAGATCC .
Samples were denatured for 1 min at 94°C , and cycling conditions were 94°C for 40 s , 58°C for 20 s , and 72°C for 40 s for 35 cycles .
Samples were quantified by phosphor imager after hybridization with a luciferase-specific probe ( Fujifilm Bas-1500 ; Fuji , Tokyo , Japan ) and expressed compared with a standard curve obtained with a luciferase plasmid .
The amount of luciferase mRNA per 5000 fg HPRT was then calculated .
The measurements were always performed in the exponential phase of the reaction , with the standard curve obtained with the plasmid template having an equation with a correlation factor of > 0.9 .
Finally , some samples were reanalyzed by real-time quantitative PCR and gave similar results .
Protein extract , EMSAs , and Western blotting Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were obtained as previously described ( 11 ) .
In brief , CD8* or Des* T cells were lysed in buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.6 ) , 10 mM KCL , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 mM EGTA , 0.75 mM spermidine , 0.15 mM spermine , 1 mM DTT , and 0.625 % Nonidet P-40 ) containing protease inhibitors ( 0.5 mM PMSF and 2 pg/ml aprotenin , leu-peptin , pepstatin A , chymostatin , and antipain ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts were collected after centrifugation , and nuclei were lysed in Nuclear lysis buffer ( 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.6 ) , 0.4 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM EGTA ) containing protease inhibitors , as described above .
For EMSA , the binding reaction was conducted using 2.5-3 ug of nuclear proteins and 10° cpm of *P-end-labeled double-stranded NF-KB oligonucleotides derived from the mouse « B intronic enhancer ( 5-GATCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAG-3 ' ) , a consensus AP-1 ( 5-GTCGACGTGAGCGCGC-3 ' ) , or consensus OCT1-and 2-binding oligonucleotides ( 5'-TTCTAGTGATTTGCATTCGACA-3 `` ) in the presence or absence of blocking Ab as previously described ( 33 ) .
Eight to ten micrograms of the same extracts were run on a 10 % poly-acrylamide gel , transferred to PolyScreen membrane , and revealed using ECL Plus ( Amersham Life Science , Buckinghamshire , U. K. ) reagents and HPRT-conjugated protein A or protein G ( Amersham ) .
The different blots were quantified by a luminescent image analyzer ( LAS-1000 plus ; Fuji ) .
Abs used for supershifts or Western blots were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) and were the p6S-specific Ab sc-109 , the pS5O-specific Ab sc-1192 , the c-Rel-specific Ab sc-70 , the anti-Bcel-2 Ab sc-492 , the anti-Bel-x ; , Ab sc-634 , and an actin-specific Ab .
6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology Results Deletion of CD8 Des `` T cells following transfer into Alb-K `` -transgenic mice To define the molecular mechanisms of T cell tolerance to a peripheral self Ag , we developed an adoptive transfer model that enabled us to analyze the transcriptional program expressed by T cells in the course of tolerance induction ( 34 ) .
The donor CD8 * T cells isolated from the Des TCR-transgenic mice are specific for the H-2K `` class I Ag and express the Des clonotype ( referred to thereafter as CD8 * Des * T cells ) .
The CD8 *Des* T cells were injected into either Alb-K®-transgenic mice that express the H-2K `` transgene only on hepatocytes ( Des- > Alb-K `` ) or nontransgenic control mice ( Des- > B10.BR ) .
To determine the fate of autoreactive T cells , we measured the number of the CD8 `` Des * T cells in the spleen of Des- > B10.BR or Des- > Alb-K `` mice at different time points after adoptive transfer .
The representation of CD8 *Des * T cells when injected into control B10.BR mice remained fairly constant over the 50-day period of analysis ( Fig .
1 ) .
On average , the CD8 *Des * T cells represented 3 % ( 1 X 10° cells ) of the total spleen population of Des- > B10.BR mice .
For the first 10 days following transfer , the number of CD8 *Des* T cells in the spleen of Des- > Alb-K `` mice was similar to that found in control Des- > B10.BR mice ( Fig .
1 ) .
However , starting around day 11 after injection , the number of CD8 *Des* T cells slowly de-creased , and ~90 % of the CD8 `` Des `` T cells had disappeared from the spleen of Des- > Alb-K `` mice by day 49 after transfer ( Fig .
1 ) .
These results suggest that , in the Alb-K® mice , expression of the H-2K `` Ag by hepatocytes may induce deletion of the CD8 *Des * T cells .
In vivo activation of the self-reactive CD8 Des T cells Deletion of autoreactive T cells has been reported in several models of peripheral T cell tolerance .
In all cases , deletion was preceded by a transient phase of autoimmunity and proliferation of the autoreactive T cells ( 2-4 ) .
We therefore determined whether in our model , too , disappearance of the CD8 `` Des T cells from the spleen was preceded by transient activation of the autoreactive T cells .
Histological analysis showed that livers from Des- > Alb-K® mice , but not livers from Des- > B10.BR mice , were infiltrated from day 2 to 6 after transfer .
However , the infiltration was transient and limited to the portal triads with minor invasion through 20 -e- Des- > Alb-KP « -o- Des- > B10.BR & | s z 15 Iffx ‘ xx 3 a 2 f §+° 10 a= $ ® = O 2 ta 5 O 0 50 40 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Days post-transfer FIGURE 1 .
Disappearance of CD8 *Des* T cells following transfer into Alb-K®-transgenic mice .
Control B10.BR- ( O ) or Alb-K®- ( @ ) transgenic mice were adult thymectomized , irradiated , and i.v .
injected with 6-8 x 10° T cells isolated from Des-transgenic mice .
At different time points after adoptive transfer , the numbers of CD8 *Des* T cells in the spleens of the recipient mice were determined by FACS staining .
For each time point , 10-20 mice were analyzed except for days 22 , 28 , and 49 , on which 3-5 animals were tested .
The mean value and SD are shown .
4401 out the lobules and no evidence of tissue damage ( data not shown ) .
We further characterized the liver-infiltrating cells by FACS staining of mononuclear cells isolated from livers of Des- > B10.BR or Des- > Alb-K `` mice .
Infiltrates from Des-B10.BR liver contained few CD8 `` Des * T cells , none of which expressed the early and late activation markers CD69 and CD44 , respectively ( Fig .
24 ) .
In contrast , we found an accumulation of CD8 * Des * T cells in the livers of Des- > Alb-K `` mice , all of which expressed the activation markers CD69 and CD44 ( Fig .
24 ) .
Starting at day 5 after transfer , 2-3 days after the beginning of liver infiltration , a fraction of the CD8 `` Des `` T cells from the spleen of Des- > Alb-K `` mice expressed CD44 .
The percentage of CD8 `` Des * T cells that expressed CD44 * further increased thereafter , with most CD8 *Des * T cells being CD44 * by day 6 after transfer ( Fig .
2B ) .
In contrast to liver-infiltrating T cells , the CD8 *Des* T cells recovered from the spleen of Des- > Alb-K `` mice did not express the early activation marker CD69 that is only transiently expressed by stimulated T cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
No change in the level of CD25 and CD62 ligand expression by CD8 `` Des * T cells isolated from Des- > B10.BR or Des- > Alb-K `` was detectable ( data not shown ) .
The kinetics of €D69 and CD44 expression suggest that , upon injection into Alb-K `` mice , CD8 *Des* T cells rapidly homed to the liver , where they were stimulated by H-2K `` -expressing hepatocytes , and the activated T cells then returned to the spleen .
We further determined whether stimulation by H-2K®-expressing liver cells induced the proliferation of the CD8 *Des * T cells .
T cell division can be measured with the fluorescent dye CFSE , which distributes equally between the two daughter cells at every division , thus resulting in a 2-fold reduction of the fluorescence intensity ( 30 ) .
The Des T cells were CFSE-labeled before transfer into recipient mice .
When injected into control B10.BR mice , most CD8 `` Des * T cells had not divided , and some divided up to two times within the 12 days of analysis ( Fig .
2B ) .
This is in agreement with the recent observation that peripheral T cells maintain a low rate of division induced by interaction of their TCR with self MHC/peptide complexes ( 35-37 ) .
In contrast , CD8 `` Des `` T cells isolated from Des- > Alb-K `` mice had divided multiple times ( Fig .
2B ) .
By day 6 after transfer , 50 % of the cells had accomplished more than three divisions , and some divided seven times ( Fig .
2B ) .
The CD8 *Des* T cells that accomplished several divisions expressed CD44 and are thus T cells that had likely infiltrated the liver ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , H-2K®-expressing hepatocytes stimulated and induced proliferation of the CD8 `` Des * T cells .
Interestingly , despite a high rate of division , the number of CD8 `` Des * T cells in the spleen of Des- > Alb-K `` mice was not significantly increased as compared with control Des- > B10.BR at day 6 or 9 after transfer , suggesting that deletion may already be occurring .
Importantly , at no time point did we detect a significant down-modulation of the expression of the TCR or CD8 coreceptor ( data not shown ) .
As described in several other models , we did not detect an increase in dying or apoptotic CD8 *Des * T cells in Alb-K `` mice as compared with control B10.BR mice .
Indeed , the number of apoptotic CD8 `` Des * T cells as detected by annexinV and propidium iodide staining was comparable in control B10.BR mice and transgenic Alb-K° mice at day 6 and 9 after transfer ( Fig .
2C and data not shown ) .
Deletion of CD8 Des T cells in Des- > Alb-K `` mice is not resulting from reduced expression of Bcel-2 or Bcl-x , The anti-apoptotic molecules Bel-2 and Bel-x , , play a critical role in the regulation of T cell survival ( 38 ) .
Hence , constitutive expression of Bel-x , prevents apoptosis in T cells activated in the 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 4402 A ) Liver infiltrating ceils Atb-kP B10.BR 1.62 % $ /m ut Sot an !

CD8 *Des* T cells isolated from Des- > Alb-K `` mice are activated .
A , Liver-infiltrating lymphocytes were isolated 4 days after transfer from four control Des-B10.BR ( thin line ) or 4 Des- > Alb-K `` transgenic ( thick line ) mice .
Cells were triple stained for Des-Tricolor , CD8-PE , and CD69-FITC or CD44-FITC as indicated .
Double-positive CD8 *Des* cells were gated ( R1 ) and analyzed for CD69 and CD44 expression .
The percentage of double-positive CD8 *Des * cells is indicated in the dot plots .
Total recovery from four livers was 2 X 10° cells ( 3.2 X 10° CD8 *Des* ) and 2.4 X 10° ( 2.8 % 10 % CD8 *Des * ) for Des- > B10.BR and Des- > Alb-K `` mice , respectively .
Similar profiles and recoveries were observed at days 5 and 6 .
B , Control B10.BR or transgenic-Alb-K `` mice were transferred with either unlabeled ( Des , two left-side histograms ) or CFSE-labeled ( Des/CFSE , right-side histograms ) T cells isolated from the Des-transgenic mice .
The splenocytes were isolated from Des- > B10.BR ( hin line ) or Des- > Alb-K `` ( thick line ) mice at different time points after transfer .
Splenocytes from mice that received unlabeled T cells ( Des ) were triple-stained and analyzed as in A. Splenocytes from mice that received CFSE-labeled T cells ( Des/CFSE ) were stained with Des-Tricolor and CD8-PE .
Double-positive CD8 *Des* cells were gated ( R1 ) and analyzed for the intensity of CFSE staining .
C , CD8 * T cells were isolated at day 9 after transfer from Des- > B1OBR or Des- > Alb-K `` mice and stained with Cy-5-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide ( PI ) as indicated .
The percentage of cells that are alive ( annexin V~PI~ ) , apoptotic ( annexin V *PIC ) , or dead ( annexin V *PI* ) is indicated in the corresponding gate .
absence of CD28-dependent costimulatory signal ( 39 ) .
The expression of Bel-2 or Bel-x , _ also prevents the in vivo deletion of mature CD8 * T cells induced by peptide Ag ( 40 ) .
However , neither Bel-2 nor Bel-x , , prevent the decline of Ag-specific CD8 * T cells after viral infection ( 40 ) .
Therefore , we determined whether deletion of the CD8 *Des* T cells in Alb-K `` mice resulted from abnormal expression of either the Bel-2 or Bel-x , , protein .
The level of expression of Bel-2 and Bel-x , , proteins was determined by Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic extracts prepared from CD8 `` Des T cells isolated from Des- > B1O0.BR mice , Des- > Alb-K `` mice , or Des- > B10.BR mice primed in vivo with H-2K `` ®-expressing APC 's ( Fig .
3 ) .
We found that the level of Bel-2 and Bel-x , , protein expression was comparable in the different population , indicating that deletion of the CD8 *Des * T cells in Des- > Alb-K `` mice is not resulting from reduced expression of either of these two antiapoptotic proteins .
CD8 * Des T cells isolated from Des Alb-K `` mice are unresponsive to in vitro restimulation Despite the proliferative response of the CD8 *Des* T cells in Des- > Alb-K `` mice , we detected no sign of liver damage or autoimmune disease ( data not shown ) , suggesting that activation of the CD8 *Des * T cells in the Des- > Alb-K `` mice was transient , followed by T cell tolerance .
One would predict , then , that the CD8 `` Des * T cells recolonizing the spleen should be tolerant and thus unresponsive to in vitro restimulation with H-2K `` -expressing APCs .
Indeed , splenocytes from Alb-K `` mice responded very poorly to H-2K `` ®-expressing APC 's in vitro ( Fig .
4 ) .
Proliferation ( data not shown ) and IL-2 and IFN-y production by in vitro stimulated CD8 *Des * T cells isolated from Des- > Alb-K `` was reduced by day 5 and almost completely abrogated by day 11 after transfer ( Fig .
4 ) .
Interestingly , as the percentage of CD44 `` CD8 `` Des * T cells ( reflecting the percentage of cells that had been stimulated by H-2K `` -expressing hepatocytes ) increased , the unresponsiveness augmented ( compare Figs .

of superantigen ( 25 , 26 ) .
To understand the molecular mechanisms of unresponsiveness in the CD8 `` Des * T cell population , we examined the AP-1 and NF- « B transcriptional activity induced by in vitro restimulation of these cells .
To directly measure transcriptional activity , we used two different lines of transgenic mice that express the firefly luciferase gene under the control of either AP-1 ( AP-1-Luc ) ( 11 ) or NF-KB sites ( NF- « B-Luc ) ( 28 ) .
As previously reported , luciferase activity in the AP-1-Luc-transgenic mice directly reflects AP-1 transcriptional activity ( 11 , 41 ) .
Likewise , luciferase activity in the NF- « B-Luc-transgenic mice directly reflects NF-KB transcriptional activity .
Indeed , luciferase activity in the NF- « B-Luc mice is only detected in tissues that demonstrate NF- « B DNA binding activity ( 28 ) .
Furthermore , luciferase reporter activity is constituvely expressed in B cells and subpopu-lations of thymocytes but not in T cells , although it can be induced in resting T cells by known inducers of NF-KB ( ( 28 , 42-44 ) and Fig .
5 ) .
Mice transgenic for the Des TCR were thus crossed with either the AP-1-Luc ( AP-1 X Des ) or NF- « B-Luc ( NF- « B X Des ) transgenic mice , and T cells from double-transgenic mice were injected into either B10.BR or Alb-K® mice .

Therefore , the inability of unresponsive CD8 *Des* T cells to produce cytokines upon TCR signaling in vitro correlates with a reduced AP-1 and NF-KB transcriptional activity , further suggesting that unresponsive CD8 * Des * T cells have a defect on the TCR signaling pathway .

However , activation was transient , and the stimulated T cells became unresponsive and likely died .
This contrasts with T cells stimulated by professional APCs that develop into effector cells and long-lived memory cells .
To understand how T cell fate may be controlled in these two situations , we examined the regulation of AP-1 and NF-KB transcription factors as tolerance or immunity developed in vivo .
The tolerant T cells were generated as described above by transfer , into Alb-K® mice , of CD8 *Des* T cells isolated from either AP-1 X Des- or NF- « B X Des- transgenic mice .
In par-allel , in vivo primed CD8 `` Des * cells were generated by immunizing AP-1 X Des or NF- « B X Des double-transgenic mice with H-2K `` ®-expressing APCs , a protocol known to induce effector and memory CTLs .
The AP-1 and NF-KB transcriptional activity was analyzed at different time points thereafter .
We found that in vivo primed CD8 `` Des * T cells exhibited a low AP-1 and NF-KB transcriptional activity , with maximal level of luciferase activity 24 h after priming ( data not shown ) .
However , in vivo primed T cells had a 2- to 3-fold lower AP-1 and NF- « B transcriptional activity as compared with in vitro activated T cells .
Not surprisingly , then , when CD8 `` Des * T cells isolated from Des- > Alb-K `` or Des- > B10.BR mice were analyzed for in vivo AP-1 or NF-KB transcriptional activity , no signal could be detected using this enzymatic assay .
Thus , we used RT-PCR to measure luciferase mRNA expression that also reflects AP-1 or NF- « B transcriptional activity but should be more sensitive than enzymatic assays .
Significant levels of AP-1 and NF- « B transcriptional activity were detected at 13 h after activation ( Fig .
7A ) .
The AP-1 transactivation declined thereafter , whereas the NF- « B transcriptional activity was long lasting and still clearly detectable at 37 h after in vivo priming .
Thus , in vivo activation of CD8 *Des * T cells is associated with an induction of AP-1 and NF-B transcriptional activity .
Using the same approach , we compared the level of AP-1 and NF- « B transcriptional activity expressed by CD8 `` Des T cells that were isolated at different time points from Des- > Alb-K® ( tolerant ) or Des- > B10.BR ( naive ) mice .
The tolerant T cells did not show detectable levels of AP-1 transcriptional activity ( Fig .
7B ) .
The very weak AP-1 signal detected at day 6 after transfer was not sustained at day 11 or 12 after transfer , when most CD8 `` Des `` T cells isolated from Des- > Alb-K `` mice are tolerant .
Similarly , at the early time point when no tolerant CD8 *Des * T were found in the spleen of Des- > Alb-K `` , T cells isolated from Des- > B10.BR or Des- > Alb-K `` mice expressed no significant NF- « B transcriptional activity ( Fig .
7B , day 4 ) .
However , tolerant T cells showed a low level of NF-KB transcriptional activity .
Indeed , NF-KB transcriptional activity was low at day 5 after transfer , when only 15-20 % of the CD8 *Des* T cells were CD44* ( tolerant ) and increased thereafter as the fraction of tolerant CD8 *Des * T cells increased ( Fig .
7B ) .
However , the maximal level of NF-KB transcriptional activity expressed by tolerant T cells was extremely low and remained 10- to 20-fold lower than the NF-B transcriptional activity expressed by in vivo primed CD8 *Des* T cells ( compare Fig .
7 , A and B ) .
Therefore , T cell activation and survival correlate with induction of AP-1 and NF- « B transcriptional activity , whereas deletion of the T cell correlates with weak NF- « B and undetectable AP-1 transcriptional activity .

All samples were normalized on the basis of the amount of HPRT mRNA detected by RT-PCR and corrected for the number of CD8 *Des* T cells .
The results are expressed as a ratio of ( A ) the amount of luciferase mRNA expressed by T cells isolated from primed mice divided by the amount expressed by T cells isolated from unprimed mice and ( B ) the amount of luciferase mRNA expressed by T cells isolated from experimental Des- > Alb-K `` mice divided by the amount expressed by T cells isolated from control Des- > B10.BR mice .
For each sample , the reverse transcription and the PCR were run in duplicates and the average of the four measurements used for calculation .
Each symbol represents one experimental group .
The NF- « B complexes expressed by tolerant CD8 Des `` T cells differ from those of naive or primed T cells We further examined how the differences in AP-1 and NF-KB transcriptional activity detected in the different CD8 * Des * T cell populations may correlate with differences in the AP-1 and NF- « B complexes generated .
We performed EMSA on nuclear extracts prepared from the different CD8 *Des * T cells analyzed above .
To define the AP-1 and NF- « B complexes induced by in vivo priming , we isolated CD8 * T cells from Des-transgenic mice either primed 5 h earlier with H-2K `` ®-expressing APCs or left unprimed .
To analyze the complexes induced by a tolerogenic signal , we isolated the CD8* T cells from either Des- > B1O0.BR or Des- > Alb-K `` ® mice 9 days after adoptive transfer , when most CD8 `` Des * T cells isolated from Des- > Alb-K `` mice are CD44* and unresponsive ( Figs .

In vivo priming led to an increase in AP-1 complexes detected by EMSA ( Fig .

Naive and tolerant T cells , that did not show AP-1 transactivation , had no detectable AP-1 complexes ( Fig .

Low levels of two defined NF- « B complexes were present in unprimed T cells , and they were strongly up-regulated in extracts isolated from primed T cells ( Fig .

Three micrograms of nuclear extracts were used for EMSA ( 4 , B , and C ) or supershift experiments ( D and £ ) using an AP-1- ( A ) , NF- « B- ( B , D , and E ) , or consensus OCT1 and 2- ( C ) specific probe .

Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments .
Variable levels of these NF- « B complexes were present in the nuclei of CD8 * T cells isolated from either Des- > B1O.BR or Des- > Alb-K `` mice .
Mainly complex N1 was barely detectable in some extracts prepared from the tolerant population ( Fig .
8D and data not shown ) .
Interestingly , an additional complex was highly abundant in the tolerant CD8 * T cells isolated from Des- > Alb-K® mice ( Fig .
8B , complex N3 ) .
To determine the composition of the different NF- « B complexes present in primed or tolerant CD8 `` Des * T cells , we performed EMSA in the presence of Abs specific for the different NF- « B members .
Supershift experiments indicated that the NF- « B complexes in primed CD8 *Des * T cells contain p65 and p50 and may contain c-Rel ( Fig .
8 , D and FE ) .
Therefore , complex N1 likely corresponds to the previously reported p65/p50 dimers , and complex N2 contains p50/p50 and , potentially , p65/c-Rel dimers ( Fig .
8D ) .
The lower band of the N3 complexes present in the tolerant CD8 *Des * T cells isolated from Des- > Alb-K `` mice was weakly inhibited by p50-specific Ab and completely inhibited by a p65-specific Ab but not with an anti-c-Rel Ab ( Fig .
8 , D and E , complexes IV ) .
The upper band of these complexes was neither inhibited nor supershifted by p65- or c-Rel-specific Abs alone , but disappeared almost completely when a mix of anti-p65 and anti-c-Rel Abs was included in the binding reaction , suggesting that it may contain p65/c-Rel heterodimer ( Fig .
8 , D and E , complexes IID ) .
This band was also inhibited to some extent by p50-specific Abs and may therefore contain p50 homodimers ( Fig .
8D ) .
The migration pattern of complexes III and IV is rather different from that expected from p65-containing complexes .
This may reflect additional posttranscriptional modifications ( 45-47 ) .
We found that the primed and tolerant T cells that show high and weak NF-KB transcriptional activity , respectively , also express different NF- « B complexes .
Indeed , the complexes detected in primed CD8 * T cells are mainly p65/p50 and p50/p50 dimers .
These classical p50-containing complexes are barely detectable in the tolerant population that expresses predominantly p65- and c-Rel-containing complexes that may correspond to homo- or heterodimer with c-Rel .
Discussion As an approach to understand the in vivo regulation of the fate of autoreactive T cells , we developed an adoptive transfer protocol in which both the cellular and molecular mechanisms of CD8 * T cell tolerance could be defined .
We analyzed the response of CD8 # * T cells to a self Ag , the class I alloantigen H-2K `` exclusively expressed by liver cells .
Adoptive transfer of mature CD8 `` Des `` T cells into Alb-K® mice led to autoimmunity , as evidenced by the liver infiltration observed by day 2 after transfer .
However , the autoimmune response was mild and transient and tolerance fol-lowed .
Indeed , we found no evidence of liver damage , and liver infiltration cleared by day 6 after transfer .
Clearly , hepatocytes can stimulate the H-2K®-specific T cells , as evidenced by the induction of CD69 and CD44 expression and the proliferation of the CD8 `` Des * T cells .
However , despite extensive proliferation , the number of CD8 *Des * T cells does not increase , and deletion of the self-reactive CD8 *Des* T cells is evident by day 10 after transfer .
Therefore , tolerance in this model is likely resulting from an abortive activation by hepatocytes of the H-2K®-specific T cells leading to T cell death , as previously suggested by Bertolino and collaborators ( 3 , 48 , 49 ) .
It is largely believed that naive T cells do not generally have access to tissue .
Our results suggest that the liver is an exception to this rule .
Indeed , in our model liver , infiltration is observed as 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 4406 REGULATION OF AP-1 AND NF- « B DURING CD8 T CELL TOLERANCE early as 2 days after adoptive transfer , wheras no activated T cells are yet detected in the spleen or lymph nodes of Alb-K `` mice .
Furthermore , activated CD8 *Des * T cells appear in the spleen of Alb-K° mice by day 6 after transfer , when liver infiltration has almost completely cleared .
Finally , in contrast to liver-infiltrating CD8 `` Des * T cells , the CD8 *Des * T cells found in the spleen do not express €D69 , a marker that is only transiently expressed by activated T cells .
Altogether , these results strongly suggest that naive CD8 `` Des * T cells gain access to the liver , are activated by H-2K®-expressing liver cells , and then recirculate to the spleen .
The mechanism of T cell deletion in Des- > Alb-K `` is still unknown .
It is possible that T cell death directly results from TCR stimulation in the absence of CD28-dependent costimulatory sig-nals .
Lack of expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bel-x ; ; is thought , in this case , to cause deletion of the responding T cells ( 39 ) .
However , both Bcl-2 and Bel-x , , are normally expressed in the tolerant CD8 *Des * T cells isolated from Des- > Alb-K `` .
An alternative explanation comes from the recent observation that the long-term maintenance of naive or memory T cells depends on survival signals induced by TCR engagement ( 35-37 , 50 , 51 ) .
Interestingly , hepatocyte-stimulated CD8 *Des* T cells are unre-sponsive .
Indeed , the CD8 *Des* T cells do not proliferate , produce cytokines , nor transactivate AP-1 or NF- « B upon in vitro restimulation .
Therefore , the tolerized CD8 `` Des * T cells present a generalized defect on the TCR signaling pathway .
Deletion of the CD8 *Des* T cells in Des- > Alb-K `` mice may therefore result from a lack of survival signals due to a desensitization of their TCR .
Further studies of the exact downstream events induced by TCR engagement that regulate T cell homeostasis are clearly required to resolve that issue .
In this study , we compared the transcriptional program expressed by three different T cell populations : 1 ) unstimulated , naive T cells ( Des- > B1OBR ) that have a life span of > 50 days , 2 ) T cells that have been primed in vivo and would develop under those conditions into effectors and memory cells , and 3 ) tolerant CD8 * T cells that are unresponsive and further deleted .
We found that prone-to-die tolerant CD8 *Des * T cells diverge from long-lived naive and primed T cells mainly at the NF- « B signaling pathway .
Indeed , hepatocyte-stimulated T cells show no detectable AP-1 and only a weak NF- « B transcriptional activity .
This contrasts with primed T cells , which demonstrate high AP-1 and NF- « B transactivation , or naive T cells , which do not have detectable AP-1 and NF- « B transcriptional activity .
As naive CD8 `` Des T cells , tolerant cells show no detectable AP-1 complexes and nuclear localization of JunD in the absence of Fos family members ( data not shown ) .
Priming induces an increase in nuclear JunD and all Fos family members ( data not shown ) .
Biochemical studies further revealed an intriguing difference in the NF- « B complexes expressed by tolerant CD8 Des * T cells as compared with naive or primed CD8 *Des * T cells .
The NF- « B complexes present in naive and primed T cells are mainly composed of p65/p50 ( N1 complex ) and p50/p50 ( NZ complex ) dimers ; priming only increases the relative representation of these complexes and may induce low levels of c-Rel-containing complexes .
Likewise , at day 5 or 10 after in vivo priming , CD8 `` Des * T cells express the N1 and NZ complexes only at levels comparable to that of naive T cells ( data not shown ) .
Although the NF-KB complexes present in naive and primed T cells contain substantial levels of p50 , this NF- « B member is almost undetectable in the complexes present in the tolerant CD8 `` Des * T cells that contain p65 and c-Rel .
Although the exact stoichiometry of the NF- « B complexes can not be clearly established by supershift experiments , these results suggest that the NF-KB complexes detected in the tolerant CD8 * Des * may correspond to homo- or heterodimers of p65 with c-Rel .
How the change in NF- « B complexes is regulated in the tolerant CD8 `` Des * T cells still remains to be determined ; however , it may result from defective TCR signaling or signaling through other cell surface receptors .
Despite the differences in Ag stimulation , the response of CD8 `` Des * T cells to H-2K `` ®-expressing hepatocytes and the in vivo responses of CD4 * T cells to superantigens have similar fea-tures : both stimuli induce proliferation of the responding cells and subsequent unresponsiveness .
However , these responses diverge in that tolerant CD8 *Des * T cells were further deleted , whereas su-perantigen-stimulated CD4 * T cells were anergic and long-lived .
In vivo anergized CD4 * T cells showed no AP-1 transactivation and show a failure of NF-KB activation linked to reduced nuclear localization of RelA and c-Rel ( 26 ) .
When comparing these two different studies , it is tempting to speculate that the difference in NF- « B complexes ' regulation may determine the fate of the responding T cell 's deletion or survival .
However , this is at odds with recent studies that suggest that NF- « B is an essential regulator of T cell survival ( 22 , 23 ) .
This was shown in transgenic mice expressing in T cells a frams-dominant IxBa that completely blocks the nuclear translocation of p65/p50 complexes , whereas the regulation of p50 homodimers remained normal ( 22 , 23 ) .
One possible explanation to reconcile these observations is that the different NF- « B complexes have different roles in T cell activation and homeostasis .
In correlation , it has been shown that the affinity for « B sites and the regulation of gene expression depends on the nature of the NF- « B complexes ( reviewed in Ref .
( 52 ) ) .
Furthermore , targeted disruption of individual members of the NF- « B family suggested that the different proteins have distinct biological functions ( 15 , 16 , 53-56 ) .
Finally , it remains possible that , in the tolerant CD8 `` Des * T cells , the p65-containing complexes ( N3 complexes ) are further regulated by post-trancriptional modifica-tion , as suggested by their altered migration in EMSA .
These modifications may alter the transcriptional activity of these complexes , a possibility that still needs to be investigated .
Further characterization of the NF-kB complexes detected in the tolerant CD8 `` Des * T cell population may help to determine to what extent « B-dependent gene expression participates in T cell survival .
