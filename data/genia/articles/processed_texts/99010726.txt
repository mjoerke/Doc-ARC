Effector pathways for this guanine nucleotide binding protein in T cells are mediated by the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 and the Ras-related GTPase Rac-1 .
In fibroblasts , an important effector for the Ras oncogene is Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PtdIns 3-kinase ) .
Activation of this lipid kinase is able to induce critical Rac-1 signaling pathways and can couple p2lras to cell survival mechanisms via the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB .
The role of PtdIns 3-kinase in Ras signaling in T cells has not been explored .
In the present study , we examined the ability of PtdIns 3-kinase to initiate the Rac-1 signaling pathways important for T cell activation .
We also examined the possibility that Akt/PKB is regulated by Ras signaling pathways in T lymphocytes .
The results show that Ras can initiate a Rac-1 mediated pathway that regulates the transcriptional function of AP-1 complexes .
PtdIns 3-kinase signals can not mimic p21lras and induce the Rac mediated responses of AP-1 transcriptional activation .
Moreover , neither TCR or Ras activation of AP-1 is dependent on PtdIns 3-kinase .
PKB is activated in response to triggering of the T cell antigen receptor ; PtdIns 3-kinase activity is both required and sufficient for this TCR response .
In contrast , p2lras signals are unable to induce Akt/PKB activity in T cell nor is Ras function required for Akt/PKB activation in response to the TCR .
The present data thus highlight that PtdIns 3-kinase and Akt/PKB are not universal Ras effector molecules .
Ras can initiate Rac-1 regulated signaling pathways in the context of T cell antigen receptor function independently of PtdIns 3-kinase activity .

This guanine nucleotide binding protein plays an important role in T lymphocyte activation by coupling the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) to the signaling pathways that regulate the activity of transcription factors important for the expression of cytokine genes ( Cantrell , 1996 ) .
These include the ETS family protein Elk-1 , the serum response factor ( SRF ) , API and Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells ( NFAT ) ( Genot et al .
, 1996 ; Woodrow et al .
, 1993 ) .
p2lras signals are also important for thymocyte development and have been shown to regulate the positive selection of thymocytes ( Swan et al .
, 1995 ) .
The Raf-1/MEK/ Erk2 pathway is one effector system for p2lras in T cells ( Izquierdo et a/ .
, 1993 , 1994 ) .
However , other Ras effector pathways must exist in lymphocytes .
For example , activation of MEK is not required for TCR induced proliferative responses of mature thymocytes whereas p21ras signals are indispensable ( Alberola-Ila , 1996 ; Alberola-Ila et al .
, 1995 ) .
Moreover , signals generated by activated p2lras but not MEK are sufficient to induce the transition of Rag-/-thymocytes from CD4/CD8 double negative to CD4/ CD8 double positive status ( Crompton , 1996 ; Swat et al .
, 1996 ) .
In addition , activation of the MEK pathway can efficiently couple the TCR to the Erk2 pathway but this is not sufficient for p2lras activation of the transcription factors API or NFAT ( Genot et al .
, 1996 ) .
Finally , in mast cells activation of Erk1/2 MAP kinases is is not required for FcsR1l regulation of NFAT at all , although activation of Ras is essential ( Genot et al .
, 1996 ; Turner and Cantrell , 1997 ) .
These studies highlight that lymphocyte activation involves the coordinated action of multiple Ras effector pathways .
A strong candidate for regulating Ras effector pathways in haematopoietic cells is the Rho family GTPase Rac-1 .
In particular , Rac-1 couples p2lras to the signaling pathways that induce the activity of the transcription factors API and NFAT ( Genot et al .
, 1996 ; Turner and Cantrell , 1997 ) .
The role of Rac-1 in Ras responses in lymphocytes has clear parallels with studies in fibroblasts where it is evident that signaling networks mediated by Rho-family GTPases such as Rac-1 and RhoA ( Qiu et al .
, 1995a , b ; Westwick et al .
, 1997 ) are important for Ras induction of cell transformation and DNA synthesis .
In fibroblasts there has been some characterisation of the mechanism that couples p21lras to the GTPase Rac-1 : notably , one key p2lras effector molecule is PtdIns 3-kinase which binds directly to active GTP bound p21lras resulting in activation of the lipid kinase ( Rodriguez-Viciana et al .
, 1994 , 1996 ) .
The PH domains of Rac/ Rho guanine nucleotide exchange proteins ( GEFs ) Ras effector pathways in T cells E Genot et al 1732 selectively bind polyphosphoinositides particularily PI ( 3,4,5 ) P ; , a product of PtdIns 3-kinase activity ( Rameh et al .
, 1997 ) .
It is thought that binding of these lipid products of PItdIns 3-kinase to PH domains of Rac/Rho GEFs either allosterically modifies GEF activity , or induces relocalization of the protein to specific subcellular locations or defined areas of the plasma membrane where activation can occur .
PtdIns 3-kinase signals can couple p21ras to a Rac-1 mediated pathway that controls the cortical actin cytoskeleton and cell transformation ( Kauffmann-Zeh et al .
, 1997 ; Reif et al .
, 1996 ; Rodriguez-Viciana et al .
, 1997 ; Wennstrom et al .
, 1994 ) .
PtdIns 3-kinase also plays an important role in coupling p21lras to a second distinct effector pathway mediated by the serine/ threonine kinase Akt/PKB ( Burgering and Coffer , 1995 ; Klippel et al .
, 1996 ; Marte et al .
, 1997 ) .
Akt/ PKB was originally identified as the cellular homologue of the transforming oncogene of the murine retrovirus AKT8 , which causes thymic lymphomas ( Staal and Hartley , 1988 ) .
This oncogene has been shown to play an important role in Ras maintenance of cell survival ( Kauffmann-Zeh et al .
, 1997 ) .
Cooperative interactions between Akt/PKB and Rac-1 and Raf-1/MEK signaling pathways are required for Ras induction of DNA synthesis and cell transformation ( Rodriguez-Viciana et al .
, 1997 ) .
By analogy with fibroblast studies , PtdIns 3-kinase is a possible candidate to couple p2lras to the Rac signaling pathways important for T cell activation .
Similarly , it is possible that Akt/PKB could be activated by Ras induced signaling pathways in T cells .
However , it is not yet known whether there are universal Ras signaling pathways that operate in every cell .
In this context , we have shown previously that PtdIns 3-kinase can only induce a subset of Rac mediated cellular responses in fibroblasts ( Reif et a/ .
, 1996 ) so it should not be assumed that PtdIns 3-kinase will couple Ras to the Rac mediated responses required for T cell transcription factor responses .
Similarily , it is not yet known whether p21lras activation of Akt/PKB is a ubiquitous response that occurs in all cell types .
AkUPKB kinase activity ( fold increase ) kinase activity ( fold increase ) empty v-Ha-ras empty v-Ha-ras S yet a A & `` D2pL1OR/P We were thus interested to explore two questions in T cells : First , the ability of p21ras to stimulate Akt/PKB ; second , the ability of PtdIns 3-kinase to initiate Rac mediated effector pathways .
These questions address an important issue ; are current models for Ras signaling pathways established in fibroblast model systems universally valid ?
Results PtdIns 3-kinase signals but not p2lras can regulate Akt/ PKB activation in T cells Expression of constitutively active p2lras results in stimulation of the kinase activity of Akt/PKB in fibroblasts and epithelial cells , indicating that Akt/ PKB is a downstream effector for p2lras .
PtdIns 3-kinase signals are also sufficient to stimulate Akt/PKB activity in these cells .
We have described that Akt/PKB is activated by PtdIns 3-kinase pathways in T cells ( Reif et al .
, 1997 ) and we were prompted to query whether Akt/PKB is an effector common to both PtdIns 3-kinase and p21lras in T cells We therefore compared the ability of constitutively active mutants of p2lras and PtdIns 3-kinase to stimulate Akt/PKB activity in T cells .
The classical PtdIns 3-kinase comprises a regulatory p85 and a catalytic pl10 subunit ( Panayotou and Waterfield , 1992 ) that phosphorylates - PtdIns ( 4,5 ) P ; - generating - PtdIns ( 3,4,5 ) P ; , and its derivatives The dissection of the role of PtdIns 3-kinase in p21lras signaling in fibroblasts has been accelerated because of the availability of a membrane targeted , constitutively active , PtdIns 3-kinase .
A chimeric protein of the extracellular and transmembrane domain of the rat CD2 marker ( rCD2 ) fused with the pl1l0 « catalytic subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase ( rCD2p1l10 ) targets the enzyme to the plasma membrane generating a constitutively active PtdIns 3-kinase that induces accumulation of PtdIns ( 3,4 ) P ; and PtdIns ( 3,4,5 ) P ; in W.B .

Results are presented as mean of two independent experiments .

Transfected cells were harvested the next day and stimulated as indicated .

Left labeled panels , labeled WB , show Ras Western blots of control cells ( top panel ) or cells expressing N17Ras ( bottom panel .
Akt/PKB activity was measured as described in a vivo ( Reif et al .
, 1996 ) .
Membrane-localised rCD2p110 or constitutively active Ras , v-Ha-ras , were co-expressed with HA-epitope tagged PKB and the activity of the tagged enzyme was assessed in immune complex kinase assays using histone 2B ( H2B ) as a substrate .
The data in Figure 1 demonstrate that co-expression of the membrane-localised rCD2p110 induced a robust activation of Akt/PKB .
This stimulatory effect of rCD2p110 was dependent on the kinase activity of the chimera since co-expression of kinase inactive rCD2p110-R/P did not stimulate Akt/ PKB activity .
In contrast , expression of constitutively active v-Ha-Ras was consistently unable to stimulate the activity of Akt/PKB .
The expression of v-Ha-ras in these experiments was confirmed by Western blot analyses .
Increasing or decreasing v-Ha-ras expression did not induce Akt/PKB kinase activity ( data not shown ) .
In parallel experiments , verification of p2l1ras functional activity was obtained by monitoring the activity of a downstream target for Ras action , the MAP kinase Erk2 .
Jurkat cells were transiently co-transfected with the expression vector encoding activated p2lras and a myc-epitope tagged p42 Erk2 .
The kinase activity of Erk2 was then assessed by standard protocols and expression of myc-tagged Erk2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis ( data not shown ) .
The data in Figure 1b show that expression of v-Ha-ras could potently stimulate Erk2 kinase activity in T lymphocytes .
T cells express all three Ras proteins , Ha Ras , K-Ras and N-Ras and we were interested to determine whether activation of the normal spectrum of endogenous Ras proteins in T cells was able to stimulate PKB activity .
In this context , it is well established that activation of T cells with phorbol esters is a powerful stimulus for inducing the accumulation of active Ras-GTP complexes .
Moreover , phorbol esters induce activation of N ras , Ha Ras and Ki Ras in T cells and initiate activation of the MAP kinase Erk2 by p2lras dependent signaling pathways ( Downward et al .
, 1990 ) .
The data in Figure 1c show that phorbol 12,13 dibutyrate ( Pdbu ) is unable to activate PKB in Jurkat cells .
We have also seen that activation of Ras with phorbol esters fails to stimulate PKB in peripheral blood derived T cells ( data not shown ) .
Also in the IL-2 dependent T cell line Kit225 phorbol esters failed to stimulate PKB activity although they effectively activate p2lras ( Reif et al .
, 1997 ) .
The main physiological stimlus for Ras in T cells is the T cell antigen receptor ( Downward et al .
, 1990 ) .
The data in Figure lc show that triggering of the TCR induces a rapid activation of PKB .
The TCR/ PKB response is prevented by the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 .
However , expression of N17 Ras , a dominant inhibitory Ras mutant , does not prevent TCR stimulation of Akt/PKB ( Figure 1¢c ) .
Collectively , these results show that p21ras signals are not sufficient or required for PKB stimulation in a number of different T cell populations .
PtdIns 3-kinase does not couple p2Iras to the Rac mediated signals that transcriptionally activate API Expression of constitutively active PtdIns 3-kinase can bypass p2lras and induce the Rac mediated signals required for cell transformation ( Rodriguez-Viciana et Ras effector pathways in T cells E Genot et al al .
, 1997 ) .
Antigen receptor activation of transcription factors such as API or NFAT is essential for cytokine gene induction in lymphocytes .
A critical signaling pathway involved in this response is initated by p21ras .
Transcriptional activity of API complexes in T cells can be induced by Ras ; this Ras response is dependent on the function of Rac-l and can be mimicked by expression of constitutively active Rac-1 .
The experiments in Figure 2a show that expression of a constitutively active Ras mutant , v-Ha-ras stimulates AP-1 activity in T cells .
Ras induction of API is blocked by expression of a dominant inhibitory mutant of Rac , Nl7Rac ( Genot et al .
, 1996 ) .
Expression of constitutively active Rac , V12Rac could also potently stimulate AP1-controlled gene transcription in T cells ( Figure 2a ) .
These results show that Ras regulation of AP-1 in T cells is mediated by the Rac GTPase .
To investigate directly whether PtdIns 3-kinase signals are sufficient to activate the Rac-1/AP-1 response in T cells , we examined the effects of the constitutively active PtdIns 3-kinase , rCD2p110 , on API transcriptional activity .
The data in Figure 2a show that expression of active PtdIns 3-kinase was not able to mimic p21lras or Rac-1 signals and induce API activity in T cells .
A second strategy to explore the role of PtdIns 3-kinase in Ras/AP-1 responses involved the use of the inhibitor LY294002 , a well characterised PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor that binds to the ATP binding site of the p110 catalytic subunit .
The data in Figure 2b show that LY294002 had no effect AP-1 activation initiated by expression of activated p2lras .
We also examined the effect of LY294002 on the ability of endogenous Ras molecules to transcriptionally activate AP-1 .
TCR agonists or phorbol esters initiate the Ras/Rac dependent pathways that regulate AP-1 in T cells .
The data in Figure 2¢ show that neither TCR or phorbol ester induction of AP-1 is blocked in cells treated with LY294002 .
The drug dose ( 10 uM ) used in these experiments is effective at inhibiting endogenous PItdIns 3-kinase activity in T cells as judged by direct measurements of PtdIns 3-kinase enzymatic activity from T cells treated with the compound ( Reif , 1997 ) .
The effectiveness of LY294002 as a supressor of endogenous PtdIns 3-kinase mediated responses was simultaneously judged in terms of its ability to prevent activation of Akt/PKB .
The data in Figure 2d show that triggering of the TCR activates Akt/PKB as does expression of the constitutively active PtdIns 3-kinase rCD2p110 .
The ability of both agonists to stimulate PKB is prevented by treatment of the T cells with LY294002 .
These results confirm that both the TCR and mutationally activated p2lras can initiate a Rac mediated signaling pathways that transcriptionally activates AP-1 in the absence of PtdIns 3-kinase signaling pathways .
p2lras but not PtdIns 3-kinase signals are able to regulate Ink The GTPase Rac can stimulate the activity of the Jnk/ Sapk pathway in T cells : expression of constitutively active Rac-1 results in activation of Jnk/Sapk and expression of dominant inhibitory mutants of Rac-1 prevents Jnk/Sapk activation during T cell activation ( Jacinto , 1998 ) .
We examined the ability of PtdIns 3 1733 Ras effector pathways in T cells E Genot et al 1734 kinase signals to stimulate the activity of Jnk/Sapk in T cells .
To examine the effect of a constitutively active mutant of PtdIns 3-kinase on Jnk regulation , cells were co-transfected with HA-epitope tagged Jnk2 ( p54 $ B Sapk ) and rCD2p1l10 , v-Ha-ras , V1l2Rac , or the guanine nucleotide exchange protein Dbl .
Co-expression of V12Rac stimulated Junk activity 20-fold respectively , as did activation of endogenous Rac signaling pathways by expression of the Dbl oncogene , an activated guanine nucleotide exchange protein that triggers endogenous Rac responses ( Figure 3 ) .
Expression of an activated p21lras oncogene , v-Ha-ras , also generates signals that are sufficient to activate the Rac/Jnk pathway in T cells ( Figure 3 ) .
Moreover , expression of mutationally activated Ras potentiates the Jnk responses triggered by calcium ionophore and phorbol ester .
The data in Figure 3 also show the effect of PtdIns 3-Kinase on the Jnk responses in T cells ; expression of rCD2p110 did not result in Jnk activation nor did PtdIns 3-kinase signals co-operate with phorbol esters and calcium signals to stimulate Jnk activity .
Further confirmation that PtdIns 3-Kinase does not mediate the effects of activated Ras on the Jnk pathway came from experiments that explored the effect of LY294002 on Jnk activation .
In these experiments it was noted that inhibition of PtdIns 3-kinase with the LY294002 compound raised basal levels of Jnk activity but did not suppress the Jnk response induced by activated p21lras ( Figure 4 ) .

The impetus for these questions comes from knowledge that p21ras function is critical for T cell activation yet little is known about Ras signaling pathways in lymphocytes .
It has been shown that PtdIns 3-kinase couples Ras to Akt/PKB in fibroblasts and epithelial cells ( Kauffmann-Zeh et al .
, 1997 ; Marte et al .
, 1997 ; Rodriguez-Viciana et al .
, 1997 ) .
The present data show that in T cells , PtdIns 3-kinase can stimulate Akt/PKB but expression of a mutationally activated Ras , v-Ha-ras does not initiate this response .
More Ras effector pathways in T cells E Genot et al over , activation of endogenous Ras proteins in T cells with phorbol esters does not result in PKB activation .
The present data also show that stimulation of T cells via the TCR activates PKB/Akt .
This response requires activation of PtdIns 3-kinase but not p2lras .
These results indicate that Ras signals are not sufficient nor are they obligate for Akt/PKB activation in T cells .
PtdIns 3-kinase activation of Akt/PKB thus seems to be a ubiquitous response in a variety of cell types .
In contrast , the role of p21ras in Akt/PKB regulation may be restricted to certain cell lineages or differentiation stages of a cell type .

Similar results were obtained in two more experiments 1735 Ras effector pathways in T cells E Genot et al 1736 One common feature of both fibroblasts and lymphocytes is that the Rho family GTPase Rac-l has critical functions in the biological role of Ras .
We have previously shown that a Ras/Rac mediated effector pathway is important for antigen receptor activation of the transcription factors AP-1 and NFAT in lymphocytes .
This response has a critical role in the regulation of cytokine gene induction in lymphocytes ( Genot et al .
, 1996 ; Turner and Cantrell , 1997 ) .

Similar results were obtained in two more experiments couple p21lras to Rac signaling pathways important for cytoskeleton organization , the induction of DNA synthesis or fibroblast transformation ( Rodriguez-Viciana et al .
, 1997 ) .
However , we show herein that PtdIns 3-kinase signals are not required nor sufficient for the Rac mediated signaling pathways important for antigen receptor control of T cell activation .
Hence , PtdIns 3-kinase is not a universal activator of the GTPase Rac and the mechanism whereby Ras couples to p2lras in T cells is unknown .
In S. Pombe , a guanine nucleotide exchange protein for a Cdc42 homologue ( Scd-1 ) , is a direct Ras effector protein that regulates morphogenesis ( Chang et al .
, 1994 ) .
This provides an example of type of biochemical mechanism that could link Ras to Rac in lymphocytes .
The present study could find no evidence for the involvement of PtdIns 3-kinase in JNK regulation in T lymphocytes although both Ras and Rac are able to regulate this kinase pathway .
This is similar to results described previously in NIH3T3 cells where PtdIns 3-kinase could not stimulate JNK or initiate Rac mediated transcription factor responses ( Reif et a/ .
, 1996 ) .
Conversely , PtdIns 3-kinase has been shown to activate the MAP kinase Jnk in Cos cells ( Klippel et Jnk2 c-jun 20 18 167 147 127 10 fold induction 32 0 30 2° 3 E $ o f : c o ° -- GH -v - T Pa _ » control LY 294002 Figure 4 - Jurkat cells were co-transfected with 10 ug of the HA-tagged Jnk2 and the empty vector or the plasmid encoding the for v-Ha-ras .
Samples were split into two and one was treated with 10 um LY294002 compound and one was treated with the vehicle only .
Jnk kinase activity was assessed as in Figure 3 al .
, 1996 ) .
These discrepancies reveal that PtdIns 3-kinase responses vary in different cell types .
Moreover , the signaling pathways that couple Ras and Rho family GTPases can differ in different cell types .
The present results thus show that current models for Ras signaling pathways placing PtdIns 3-kinase as a molecular link between Ras and Rac may be true for some cells but Ras can initiate Rac-1 regulated signaling pathways independently of PtdIns 3-kinase activity in T cells .
Similarily , PKB is implicated as a Ras effector important for cell survival in some cell systems but we now show that PKB is not a universal Ras effector molecule in T lymphocytes .
Ras effector pathways can thus be integrated differently in different cell types .
This could reflect fundamental differences between the 'wiring ' of Ras effector pathways in different cell lineages .

Ras effector pathways in T cells E Genot et al medium containing 10 % heat-inactivated foetal calf serum .
The amounts of DNA transfected in each experiment were kept constant by adding empty vector .
Cells were transfected via electroporation ( Gene pulser : Bio-Rad , UK ) .
Briefly , cells were pulsed ( 1x 10 ' cells/0.5 ml ) in complete medium at 960 uF and 310 V. Cells transfected with similar plasmid mixtures were pooled and re-aliquoted before stimulation .
CAT assays and protein kinase assays CAT assays were performed as previously described ( Genot et al .
, 1996 ) .
For Jnk kinase assays , cells were transfected with an HA-tagged version of Jnk2 together with various expression plasmids .
Eighteen hours after transfection , cells were stimulated for the indicated period of time or left untreated .
Cells were then harvested and equivalent numbers of living cells were subjected to immunoprecipita-tion using 12CAS antibodies for epitope tagged HA-Akt and HA-Jnk by standard protocols .
The kinase reaction was performed using GST-Jun as a substrate in the presence of ATP .
After incubation at 30°C for 30 min , the reaction was stopped with Laemmli sample buffer and kinase reaction products were analysed on a 10 % SDS-PAGE .
The lower half of the gel was dried down and [ P ] incorporation into c-jun was quantitated using a phosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
The upper part of the gel containing immunoprecipitated tagged protein kinase was transfered onto polyvinyldifluoridine membranes ( Immobilon , Millipore ) and detected with anti-Jnk2 antibodies , ECL Western blotting detection reagents ( Amersham ) followed by auto radiography .
Kinase assays for Akt/PKB were performed similarly , using H2B as a substrate and anti-PKB antibodies for kinase detection .
Erk2 kinase assays were performed by immunoprecipitat-ing myc-tagged Erk2 with 9E10 antibodies and with myelin basic protein as a substrate .
In the case of Akt/PKB kinase assays , the amount of kinase expressed was determined by scanning the autoradiography of the Western blot and processing the data with the Adobe Photoshop program .
H2B phosphorylation was normalised to the amount of HA-Akt/PKB in each sample and thus expressed as fold increase of the control response .
