Murphy** *Department of Pathology and Center for Immunology Howard Hughes Medical Institute Washington University School of Medicine St. Louis , Missouri 63110 tMolecular and Cell Biology Department University of California , Berkeley Berkeley , California 94720-3200 Summary Recently , the transcription factor GATA-3 was shown to be selectively expressed in Th2 but not Thi cells and to augment Th2-specific cytokines .
Here , we show that loss of GATA-3 expression by developing Th1 cells requires IL-12 signaling through Stat4 and does not simply result from an absence of IL-4 .
Moreover , we demonstrate a novel role for GATA-3 in directly repressing Thi development distinct from its positive actions on Th2-specific cytokines .
GATA-3 inhibits Th1 cytokines by a cell-intrinsic mechanism that is not dependent on IL-4 and that may involve repression of IL-12 signaling .
Thus , GATA-3 expression and IL-12 signaling are mutually antagonistic , which facilitates rapid dominance of one pathway during early Th development , producing a stable divergence in cytokine profiles .
Introduction Interferon y ( IFNy ) protects against many viral and intracellular pathogens through pleiotropic effects on both innate and specific immune cells ( Bach et al .
, 1997 ) .
Among the important sources of IFNy are natural killer ( NK ) cells , CD8+* cytolytic T cells , and the CD4 * T helper ( Th ) 1 subset .
NK cells and CD8 * T cells rapidly produce IFNy following primary activation , whereas CD4 * T cells undergo a period of development that determines whether type I or II cytokines are produced ( Abbas et al .
, 1996 ) .
Important for Thi development is interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) ( Hsieh et al .
, 1993b ; Manetti et al .
, 1993 ) produced by activated macrophages and dendritic cells ( Macatonia et al .
, 1993 , 1995 ; de Saint- Vis et al .
, 1998 ) , which acts through a mechanism involving Stat4 ( Bacon et al .
, 1995 ; Jacobson et al .
, 1995 ; Kaplan et al .
, 1996 ; Thierfelder et al .
, 1996 ) .
At present , little is known regarding the mechanism by which Statd4 activation influences the early differentiation processes that regulate IFNy production by CD4 * T cells .
Recently , a molecular basis of subset-restricted IL-4 production has been proposed by the identification of £ To whom correspondence should be addressed ( email : murphy @ immunology.wustledu ) .
c-maf ( Ho et al .
, 1996 ) and GATA-3 ( Zheng and Flavell , 1997 ) as Th2-specific transcription factors .
C-maf expression is selectively increased in Th2 development and interacts directly with the proximal IL-4 promoter at the MARE element to augment transcription ( Ho et al .
, 1996 ) .
GATA-3 , also expressed by naive and Th2 cells but not Th1 cells , was shown to augment transcription of the IL-4 and IL-5 genes ( Zhang et al .
, 1997 ; Zheng and Flavell , 1997 ; Lee et al .
, 1998 ) .
The basis for Th2-selec-tive expression of these transcription factors is not yet understood in terms of responses to cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-4 that control T helper development .
Nonetheless , collectively c-maf and GATA-3 provide a basis for the positive regulation of several Th2-specific cytokine genes .
In contrast , the basis for Th1-selective expression of IFNy has not yet been firmly linked to IL-12 or to Stat4 .
Studies of IFNy regulation have identified several potential positive and negative cis-acting regulatory elements { Young and Hardy , 1995 ) .
However , most current information is based on transformed tumor models , and which of these elements operate in Th1/Th2 regulation has not been addressed .
A proximal element interacts with CREB/ATF1 transcription factors , but these factors have not been described as acting in a subset-restricted manner ( Cippitelli et al .
, 1995 ; Penix et al .
, 1996 ) .
Another study reported a positive GATA-3 interaction with a dis-tal IFNy promoter element ( Penix et al .
, 1993 ) but preceded the recognition that GATA-3 was present in Th2 but not Thi cells .
The potential repressor YY-1 was shown to interact with an element in the proximal IFNy promoter { Ye et al .
, 1996 ) , but it has not been shown to be differentially regulated between Th1 and Th2 cells .
Young and colleagues identified a class of sites interacting with NF- « B and possibly NF-AT factors ( Sica et al .
, 1997 ) .
Several elements in the promoter and first intron of the IFNy gene were identified that could potentially interact with STAT factors ( Xu et al .
, 1996 ) .
Many of these elements were nonconsensus STAT elements that weakly interacted with several STAT factors , including Stati , Stat4 , and Stat6 .
The direct role for Stat4 at these sites in Th1i-specific IFNy expression was not established .
Here , we report several novel findings .
First , we describe a new Stat4-dependent process by which IL-12 can augment IFNy in CD4* T cells .
We show that IL-12 signaling via Stat4 is required for full repression of GATA-3 in Th1 cells and in turn that GATA-3 acts as a repressor of Thi development and IFNy production .
The inhibition by GATA-3 of IFNy production is not simply a secondary effect of GATA-3 on IL-4 production , since it occurs equally in IL-4-deficient T cells and by a cell-autonomous mechanism .
Second , we show that GATA-3 represses IFNy production only when continuously expressed during initial naive T cell development but not when reintroduced into Th1 cells after IL-12-induced Thi development .
This suggests GATA-3 may regulate an early step in Thi development rather than directly Immunity 746 A WT __ Stati ( /- ) Stat4 ( /- ) [ ~ mls I 1 IL-12 $ 00 soos !

repressing the IFNy promoter .
This is supported by our data that GATA-3 inhibits IL-12 receptor expression but does not inhibit reporter activity of the IFNy promoter .
Finally , reintroduction of GATA-3 into Th1 cells , even as early as 7 days after priming , fails to induce IL-4 expression , suggesting that GATA-3 alone is not sufficient to induce IL-4 production and may be required to act during a temporally restricted window of development .
Results Complete Repression of GATA-3 in Developing Naive T Cells Requires IL-12 and Stat4 GATA-3 was recently shown to be a Th2-specific factor that could positively regulate the transcription of both IL-4 and IL-5 ( Zhang et al .
, 1997 ; Zheng and Flavell , 1997 ; Lee et al .
, 1998 ) .
Zheng and colleagues used RT-PCR to show that GATA-3 was present in naive T cells and is increased during Th2 development and extinguished during Thi development .
The loss of GATA-3 during Th1 development could result either because IL-4 is required for its maintenance or because IL-12 is required for its suppression .
To distinguish these possibilities we examined GATA-3 expression during development of naive CD4 * T cells activated under a variety of conditions ( Figure 1 ) .
First , GATA-3 expression is maintained even when developing T cells are activated in the absence of IL-4 and IL-12 ( Figure 1A , lane 3 ) , a condition that does not generate IL-4-producing T cells .
GATA-3 is enhanced by IL-4 addition ( lane 4 ) consistent with the results of Zheng et al .
( 1997 ) .
IFNy slightly reduced GATA-3 expression ( Figure 1A , lanes 2 and 3 ) , but addition of IL-12 produced complete loss of GATA-3 mRNA ( lane 1 ) .
The complete extinction of GATA-3 mRNA caused by IL-12 involves both Stat4 and Stati ( Figure 1A , lanes 5-8 ) .
In DO11.10 T cells lacking either Stati or Stat4 , IL-12 treatment did not completely repress GATA-3 ( Figure 1A , lanes 5 and 7 ) , but rather GATA-3 mRNA remained at a level similar to T cells not exposed to IL-12 .
Because the effects of IL-12 were potentially a result secondary to changes in IL-4 levels rather than direct effects of IL-12 signaling , we repeated these experiments using DO11.10 mice crossed to the IL-4-deficient background ( Figure 1B ) .
IL-12 inhibited GATA-3 expression in wild-type DO11.10 T cells ( Figure 1B , lanes 1 and 2 ) as before but also in IL-4-deficient T cells ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Notably , the maintenance of GATA-3 expression in T cells is not dependent on the presence of IL-4 during early activation of primary cells ( Figure 1B , lane 5 ) .
Similarly , in concanavalin A ( Con A ) activated Staté-deficient T cells , we observed that IL-12 reduced GATA-3 expression , ( Figure 1B , lanes 7-9 ) .
Finally , Western analysis confirmed that IL-12 dramatically inhibited GATA-3 protein expression independently of IL-4 ( Figure 1C ) .
Repression of GATA-3 protein by IL-12 occurred in IL-4-deficient T cells as well as in Staté-deficient T cells { lane 7 ) .
High levels of GATA-3 expression induced by IL-4 appeared Stat6-dependent ( Figure 1B , lanes 8 and 9 ; Figure 1C , lanes 8 and 9 ) as well .
GATA-3 Expression Blocks Thi Development and IFNy Production Independently of IL-4 The IL-12-dependent inhibition of GATA-3 suggests a reciprocal repressive role for GATA-3 in Thi development .
To test this , we wished to maintain GATA-3 expression during IL-12-induced Thi development .
We generated a bi-cistronic retrovirus coexpressing GATA-3 and GFP ( Figure 2A ) .
This retrovirus expresses GATA-3 under control of MSCV LTR that is not inhibited by IL-12 , thus maintaining GATA-3 expression during early T cell IL-4-Independent Th1 Repression by GATA-3 747 A MSV Xhop | MScy D WT WT IL4 ( / ) WT GFP-RV ( empty vector ) |5 LTR| { NIGER 3 ' LTR Thi Th2 Thi Thi SLT lires \ [ s TR a GATAE-RV 5 ' LTR | GATA3 s tR 4 4 aa t 5 A AL L4 A e A A % % R A B GFP-RV GATAI-RV f 55 kD 4 ece - ac 10 20 3 4 50 6 E L2 _ 2500 E - 2000 & € - 1500 > 6 1000 t 500 < 34 < 34 D C ® a a 7 E 6 it o 5 a £ 4 é `` 1 Untransfected GFP-RV z g l—L ‘ J—l o ¥ camry 3 EZ .

GATA-3 Inhibits IL-12-Induced Thi Development and IFNy Production ( A ) Retroviral constructs .
The retrovirus vector containing only GFP ( GFP-RV ) was used in all experiments to control for the effects of retrovirus infection .
The GATA-3-expressing retrovirus ( GATA3-RV ) contains murine GATA-3 cDNA placed behind the murine stem cell virus ( MSCV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and upstream of the internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) from encephalomyocarditis virus in GFP-RV .
( B ) DO11.10 TCR-transgenic T cells were infected on day 1 of primary activation by either control ( GFP-RV ) or GATA-3-expressing ( GATA3-RV ) retrovirus , treated using Th1-inducing and Th2-inducing conditions as indicated ( Experimental Procedures ) , harvested on day 7 , stained with anti-CD4-PE ( Pharmingen ) , and analyzed by two-color FACS .
Numbers represent the quadrant statistics of live-gated events .
These cells were then sorted for GFP/CD4 expression .
( C ) GFP-positive T cells that were sorted from the indicated populations in ( B ) were reactivated with OVA/APCs and analyzed after 3 days for GFP expression by FACS .
Data is presented as single-color histograms of live gated events .
The negative control ( untransfected ) was a noninfected parallel Thi culture from the same experiment .
( D ) GATA-3 expression in the sorted populations from ( C ) was determined by Western analysis 7 days after restimulation .
10 `` T cells from the indicated transfection were stimulated by PMA and ionomycin for 4 hr before lysis for Western analysis for GATA-3 .
( E ) DO11.10 TCR-transgenic primary T cells were activated under either Th1 or Th2 conditions as indicated and infected by GFP-RV , GATA3-RV on day 1 .
GPF+* CD4 T cells were purified by cell sorting on day 7 and stimulated with OVA and APCs , expanded for 7 days , harvested , washed , and stimulated at 1.25 X 10 % /ml with 0.3 wM OVA and irradiated BALB/c splenocytes as APCs .
Supernatants were harvested after 48 hr and IFNy and IL-4 production determined by ELISA as described .
Similar results were obtained in six other independent retroviral transfection experiments .
development .
Naive T cells were activated with antigen under conditions to induce either Thi or Th2 development and were infected with retrovirus on day 1 after primary activation .
Cells were allowed to develop until day 7 , when retroviral infection was determined by measuring GFP expression ( Figure 2B ) and infected cells were purified by cell sorting .
CD4+* GFP+ TCR transgenic T cells were purified to greater than 95 % ( Figure 2C ) .
Expression of GATA-3 under LTR control achieved levels of protein expression very similar to levels expressed by native Th2 cells ( Figure 2D ) , both in wild-type DO11.10 T cells ( compare lanes 2 and 3 ) and in IL-4-deficient DO11.10 T cells ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
To control for any effect of virus infection itself , all experiments were done using GATA-3-expressing retrovirus ( GATA-3-RV ) and empty-retrovirus expressing only GFP ( GFP-RV ) as a control .
Maintenance of GATA-3 expression in IL-12-treated developing T cells virtually eliminated subsequent IFNy production ( Figure 2E ) .
This also modestly augmented IL-4 production but did not fully increase levels of IL-4 to that of Th2 cells ( Figure 2E ) .
Further , GATA-3 expression in IL-4-treated T cells did not increase IL-4 production above control Th2 levels .
To explore potential mechanisms of this GATA-3 action , we examined a mutant form of GATA-3 , KRR .
In this mutant , amino acids 305-307 ( KRR ) , located just before the second zinc finger domain , are changed to AAA ( Smith et al .
, 1995 ) .
This mutant was reported to exert a dominant negative effect on a synthetic reporter construct containing multimers of GATA elements ( Smith et al .
, 1995 ) but to retain the ability to bind DNA .
Expression of the KRR GATA-3 mutant in IL-12-treated developing Thi cells caused the same total reduction in IFNy and slight IL-4 augmentation as wild-type GATA-3 ( Figure 2E ) .
This suggests that the relevant GATA-3 target sites in developing T cells are not affected by the KRR mutation unlike the multimerized GATA reporters used previously ( Smith et al .
, 1995 ) , but nonetheless reinforces the results seen for wild-type GATA-3 .
To determine if the inhibition of IL-12-induced IFNy Immunity 748 Figure 3 .

The ( WT ) - anti-CD3 production was simply the result of increased IL-4 production , we repeated these experiments with IL-4-deficient DO11.10 T cells ( Figure 3 ) .
Maintaining GATA-3 expression in IL-12-treated IL-4-deficient DO11.10 T cells completely inhibited IFNy production compared to control cells ( Figure 3A , upper panel ) .
Inhibition occurred even though GATA-3 could not induce IL-4 in these cells ( Figure 3A , lower panel ) , suggesting an IL-4-independent mechanism , such as by blockade of some intrinsic signaling pathway or transcription factor .
IFNy production was recently shown to be induced not only by TCR but induced synergistically by IL-12 and IL-18 ( Okamura et al .
, 1995 ; Robinson et al .
, 1997 ) .
Thus , we asked whether GATA-3 might differentially interfere with these pathways .
We tested whether GATA-3 inhibited IFNy production stimulated by IL-12 and IL-18 , in addition to anti-CD3 , in both wild-type and IL-4-deficient DO11.10 T cells ( Figure 3B ) .
GATA-3 expression inhibited all modes of IFNy induction , TCR-dependent and cytokine-dependent , in both wild-type ( Figure 3B , upper panel ) and IL-4-deficient { lower panel ) DO11.10 T cells , whereas control T cells showed IFNy production in response to both IL-12/IL-18 treatment and to anti-CD3 .
GATA-3 Inhibits IL-12-Induced IFNy Production by a Cell-Intrinsic Mechanism As a transcription factor , GATA-3 could potentially augment or repress numerous cytokines .
Thus , we examined the effect of GATA-3 on a panel of Th1- and Th2-specific factors using RNase protection ( Figure 4A ) .
Again , substantial reduction in IFNy production occurred in GATA-3-expressing Th1 cells relative to GFP-RV controls .
This also implies that the inhibition of IFNy is at the level of transcription , or possibly mRNA stability .
Importantly , three other Th1-specific cytokines , tumor necrosis factor « ( TNF « ) , TNFB , and lymphotoxin B ( LTB ) were also significantly inhibited by maintenance of GATA-3 in IL-12-induced Th1 development ( Figure 4A ) .
TNFR and LTB showed virtually complete repression , L4G ) Thi confirmed by Western ( Figure 2D ) .
Cytokine production was measured by ELISA from supernatants taken 48 hr after stimulation .
( B ) Wild-type ( WT ) or IL-4-deficient ( IL-4 ( -/- ) ) DO11.10 T cells infected with GFP-RV or GATA3-RV and purified as described above .
On day 7 , T cells were stimulated with IL-12 ( 10 U/ml ! )
or IL-18 ( 50 ng/m ! )
or plate-bound anti-CD3 MAb ( 5 ug/ml ) as indicated .
At 48 hr , supernatants were harvested and IFNy determined by ELISA .
The asterisks indicate that the IFNy was less than 3 ng/ml .
Similar results were obtained in two additional independent experiments .
+ anti-CD3 whereas TNFa showed approximately 5- to 10-fold inhibition ( Figure 4A , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
As before , this inhibition occurred independently of IL-4 , since these effects were identical when repeated using IL-4-deficient DO11.10 T cells ( Figure 4A , lane 5 ) .
In addition , these experiments confirmed previously reported augmentation of several Th2-specific cytokines by GATA-3 , including the augmentation of IL-4 ( Figure 4A , lane 7 ) and IL-6 ( lane 2 ) .
However , in contrast to a previous report that IL-5 , and IL-13 were not influenced by GATA-3 ( Zheng and Flavell , 1997 ) , we find augmentation of mRNA for each of these cytokines , even in IL-4-deficient DO11.10 T cells , suggesting a direct role of GATA-3 , rather than indirectly inducing these Th2 cytokines via IL-4 production .
These findings extend the previous findings for GATA-3 in controlling Th2 cytokine expression , while demonstrating a novel IL-4-independent inhibition of IL-12-induced Th1 development .
Since some GATA-3-induced cytokines besides IL-4 could potentially inhibit IFNy production , we asked if this inhibition was dependent on the extracellular milieu or rather could act in a cell-autonomous manner .
By analyzing IFNy production at the single-cell level , we compared intracellular IFNy production in DO11.10 T cells that were either infected or uninfected by retrovirus while developing in the same cell culture induced to undergo Thi development ( Figure 4B ) .
Three-color FACS analysis was used to discriminate whether T cells had been infected with retrovirus or not and to determine the level of intracellular IFNy production ( Figure 4B ) .
Infection of T cells by GFP-RV control virus did not diminish IFNy production of infected T cells compared to uninfected T cells ( Figure 4B , left panel ) .
In contrast , infection of T cells by GATA-3-expressing retrovirus significantly reduced intracellular IFNy production of the infected T cells but not the uninfected T cells in the same culture ( Figure 4B , right panel ) .
This result suggests that despite augmentation in certain Th2-type cytokines induced by GATA-3 , the inhibition of IL-12-induced IFNy is largely mediated by GATA-3 directly within the T cell .

GATA-3 Inhibition of IL-12-Induced IFNy Is Limited to an Early Developmental Window GATA-3 could act to directly repress IFNy transcription or could act only developmentally , perhaps by interfering with a Statd4-dependent development process .
To distinguish these possibilities , we asked at what stages of Thi development GATA-3 could inhibit IFNy production .
We therefore extended our previous retroviral infection experiments to include infection on day 1 , as before , but also on day 8 after primary T cell development and infection of a fully differentiated Th1 clone , 3F6 ( Figure 5 ) .
Cells infected with GATA-3-expressing or GFP control retroviruses were purified by cell sorting for GFP expression 6 days following infection , expanded for 1 week , and cytokines analyzed by ELISA .
As before , infection of primary DO11.10 T cells on day 1 inhibited the IL-12-induced Thi development , with nearly complete inhibition of IFNy production and 40 % augmentation of IL-4 production ( Figure 5A , upper left and lower left panels ) .
In contrast , when Thi development was imposed first for 7 days and T cells then infected on day 8 , the GATA-3-expressing retrovirus produced only a 20 % reduction in IFNy production relative to control T Immunity 750 A Day 1 Infection Day 8 Infection 300 m GFP-RV p cataz-Rv f -- A ) a 20 ‘ | 2 an « oor IL-4 ( ng/m ! )

All populations were purified by cell sorting on day 6 after infection and restimulated as described above .

This 20 % inhibition of IFNy production was also seen in IL-4-deficient T cells .
Significantly , under these conditions , no detectable increase in IL-4 production was seen ( Figure 5A , lower middle panel ) .
Finally , the infection of 3F6 by GATA-3 retrovirus produced no detectable reduction in IFNy and , notably , no increase in IL-4 production ( Figure 5A , right panels ) .
Again , GATA-3 protein expression was confirmed by Western analysis for the day 8 infection ( Figure 5B ) and 3F6 ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the reintroduction of GATA-3 into T cells after Th1 development has occurred but does not result in inhibition of IFNy or the augmentation of IL-4 production .
Penix and colleagues have suggested GATA-3 may augment IFNy via a cis-acting element in the proximal promoter ( Penix et al .
, 1993 ) .
Our results suggest GATA-3 may inhibit IFNy production .
Therefore , we asked whether the GATA-3 expression could augment or inhibit luciferase activity of an IFNy promoter construct that includes the proposed GATA-3 target sequence ( Figure 5C ) .
The IFNy reporter construct was cotransfected into EL-4 cells ( Szabo et al .
, 1993 ) with either GATA-3 retrovirus or GFP-RV control .
Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection of a CMV promoter- Renilla luciferase construct .
GATA-3 had minimal effects on IFNy promoter activity ( Figure 5C ) .
No inhibition was seen by GATA-3 for this reporter ( Figure 5C ) or for a series of E PMA+lonomycin into EL4 cells ( Experimental Procedures ) as indicated .
Cells were stimulated with ( closed bars ) or without ( open bars ) PMA and ionomycin for 4 hr as described and luciferase activity determined ( Szabo et al .
, 1993 ) .
Transfection was normalized by CMV-Renilla and data represent fold-induction compare to the unstimulated GFP-RV vector transfection .
‘ mid and with either GFP-RV or GATA3-RV GATA3-RV larger and smaller IFNy promoter constructs , including a 3 kilobase genomic promoter region ( data not shown } .
We conclude that GATA-3 is unlikely to exert direct repression of the IFNy promoter but rather may modify a developmental program whose actions are temporally restricted .
GATA-3 Inhibits IL-12 Signaling by Repressing IL-12R B2 Expression IL-4-deficient DO11.10 T cells infected on day 1 of primary antigen activation with the GATA-3 retrovirus or GFP-RV control were purified by cell sorting for GFP-positive cells and expanded and analyzed for functional IL-12 signaling by EMSA ( Figure 6A ) .
For T cells infected by GFP-RV control retrovirus , treatment by IL-12 in primary activation produced cells exhibiting the expected IL-12-induced Stat4 complex binding the M67 SIE probe ( Figure 6A , lane 4 ) ( Jacobson et al .
, 1995 ) .
In contrast , for T cells infected with GATA-3 retrovirus , treatment by IL-12 during primary activation produced cells that failed to show IL-12-induced Stat4 complexes ( Figure 6A , lane 4 ) .
Because the IL-12R B2 subunit is regulated in Th1/ Th2 development ( Szabo et al .
, 1995 , 1997 ) , we asked if GATA-3 expression influenced its expression using Northern analysis ( Figure 6B ) We found that IL-12-induced Th1 cells infected by GATA-3 retrovirus on day 1 of primary activation later showed complete absence of IL-12R8 subunit mRNA , in contrast to IL-12-treated IL-4-Independent Th1 Repression by GATA-3 751 A B GFP-RV _ GaTA-RV wi wi 4 ) ~~ Thi -- Th2 - Thi , o- -I ~s IL-12 - g L AR & Q ® 5 t t t t 1 % % % % IL-12Ra2 « # me ?

GATA-3 Inhibits IL-12 Signaling and Represses IL-12R B2 Subunit mRNA Expression ( A ) IL-4 ( -/- ) DO11.10 T cells were infected with GFP-RV or GATA-3-RV retrovirus and purified and expanded as described in Figure 3 .
The indicated T cells were left untreated ( - ) or treated ( + ) with IL-12 ( 10 U/m ! )
for 30 min , nuclear extracts prepared and examined by EMSA using the m67 SIE probe for Staid4 activation , or Ea probe to control for extract .

and IL-12 ( 10 U/m ! )

T cells infected by the GFP control virus .
GATA-3 inhibited IL-12R B2 expression in IL-4-deficient DO11.10 T cells ( Figure 6B , lane 5 ) , consistent with the results above .
Surprisingly , inhibition of IL-12R B2 mRNA by GATA-3 was evident even in IL-12-treated T cells that were infected on day 8 after primary activation ( Figure 6C ) , a situation where we previously found no inhibition of IFNy production ( Figure 5 ) .
Because by day 8 these T cells have already been exposed to IL-12 for 7 days before infection , it is possible that the developmental action of Stat4 had already occurred to allow TCR inducible IFNy transcription .
Thus , to test the functional significance of GATA-3-induced down-regulation of IL-12R B2 in the day 8 infection , we examined the IFNy production in response to IL-12 in the presence or absence of antiCD3 ( Figure 6D ) .
As expected , anti-CD3-induced IFNy production was unaffected by GATA-3 in T cells infected on day 8 ( Figure 6D , lower panel ) , either in the presence or absence of IL-12 .
However , treatment of T cells by IL-12 alone can elicit a small amount of IFNy production ( Figure 6D , upper panel ) , but this occurs only in T cells infected on day 8 with the control GFP virus and not with GATA-3-expressing retrovirus .
Thus , reintroduction of GATA-3 into differentiated Thi cells can inhibit IL-12R B2 expression and block subsequent IL-12-induced responses , but TCR-induced IFNy production remains intact presumably because the developmental effects of Stat4 have already occurred to allow TCR-induced IFNy production .
The above results imply that IL-12 represses GATA-3 expression in developing Thi cells and that GATA-3 inhibits IL-12 receptor expression in developing Th2 cells .
This predicts a reciprocal expression pattern of these genes during Thi and Th2 development .
A kinetic analysis of GATA-3 and IL-12 R B2 mRNA between day 1 and 5 supports this prediction ( Figure 7 ) .
In primary T cells induced toward Th2 development , GATA-3 mRNA appears induced by 24 hr , whereas in Th1 development , IL-12R B2 mRNA is just detectable at 24 hr but is significantly higher at 48 hr .
Notably , although GATA-3 mRNA is highest at 48 hr , we observe detectable IL-12R B2 mRNA at both 48 and 72 hr even in Th2 conditions , but which declines after this time .

GATA-3 and IL-12R B2 mRNA Expression during Early Stages of Thi and Th2 Development T cells fom DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice were activated using 0.3 wM OVA peptide and APCs under either Th1i- or Th2-inducing conditions ( Experimental Procedures ) , harvested at indicated times , total RNA prepared and analyzed for GATA-3 , IL-12R§B2 and HPRT expression by Northern analysis .
Immunity 752 that some IL-12 B2 mRNA is expressed early during Th2 development between days 2 and 3 despite early GATA-3 induction , which could potentially allow IL-12 to repress GATA-3 if exposure occurred during this period .
Discussion This study makes several novel observations .
First , GATA-3 acquires a Th2-specific expression not simply from being induced by IL-4 but from being actively repressed by IL-12 .
This repression of GATA-3 mRNA by IL-12 involves Stat4 .
Next , maintenance of GATA-3 expression in developing T cells strongly inhibits IL-12-induced Thi development , not simply as an indirect effect of augmenting IL-4 production but rather by a cell-autonomous mechanism occurring independently of IL-4 .
However , introduction of GATA-3 into a differentiated Th1 cell does not inhibit IFNy production , and GATA-3 does not directly repress the IFNy promoter .
Rather , the inhibition by GATA-3 of IL-12-induced Th1 development is limited to the first week of primary T cell activation .
We observe that GATA-3 represses IL-12R B2 mRNA expression , thereby preventing IL-12 signaling during an early developmental window and blocking Th1 development .
This mechanism explains the previously described extinction of IL-12R B2 mRNA during Th2 development .
Recently , several studies have analyzed the transcriptional basis for Th subset-specific expression of various cytokine genes .
The transcription factors c-Maf ( Ho et al .
, 1996 ) and GATA-3 ( Zheng and Flavell , 1997 ) were both identified as Th2-specific cytokines , with c-Maf being shown to interact directly with the IL-4 proximal promoter and having actions relatively restricted to the IL-4 but not the IL-5 gene .
In contrast , GATA-3 was demonstrated to be a Th2-specific factor that may act on other cytokine genes , particularly IL-5 ( Zhang et al .
, 1997 ; Lee et al .
, 1998 ) .
GATA family transcription factors regulate many lineage and cell-specific processes .
GATA-1 and GATA-2 regulate development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages ( Weiss and Orkin , 1995 ; Wu et al .
, 1995 ; Maeno et al .
, 1996 ; Melotti and Calabretta , 1996 ; Takahashi et al .
, 1997 ) .
GATA-3 appears to play roles in nervous system and fetal hemato-poetic development ( Pandolfi et al .
, 1995 ) as well as in early thymocyte development ( Hattori et al .
, 1996 ; Ting et al .
, 1996 ) .
GATA-3 is the only GATA factor expressed in T lymphocytes , and its regulation is complex ( Lieuw et al .
, 1997 ) .
T cell-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites were identified as far as 10.7 kb upstream of the transcriptional start of GATA-3 , but the functional role in directing expression has not been verified ( Lieuw et al .
, 1997 ) .
To date , the basis for the Th2-specific T cell expression of GATA-3 has not been determined .
This report suggests that GATA-3 expression is augmented by IL-4 via Stat6 ( Figure 1C ) but that full Tha specificity involves a repression in Th1 cells that requires IL-12 and Statd4 to become complete ( Figures 1A and 1B ) .
One surprising result of the present study was that GATA-3 expression in T cells is not sufficient for IL-4 production as previously suggested ( Zheng and Flavell , 1997 ) .
Expression of GATA-3 continuously after activation of primary T cells , even under Th1-inducing conditions , led to augmentation of IL-4 .
However , reexpression of GATA-3 in T cells that had developed in Th1-inducing conditions for 8 days did not lead to detectable IL-4 production , despite clear demonstration of GATA-3 protein expression .
Thus , the mechanism of GATA-3 augmentation of IL-4 expression may involve processes that are temporally restricted or require cooperation with unidentified factors .
This report also suggests that GATA-3 inhibits Th1 development through a repression of IL-12 signaling that is IL-4-independent .
While GATA factors typically are thought of as positive regulators of gene expression , this is not always the case .
The pannier ( pnr ) gene , a Drosophila melanogaster protein belonging to the GATA family , influences expression of the achaete ( ac ) and scute ( sc ) genes ( Ramain et al .
, 1993 ; Haenlin et al .
, 1997 ) and may act either as a repressor or activator depending on association with other factors such as extramacrochaetae ( eme ) ( Heitzler et al .
, 1996 ) .
During the first week after primary T cell activation , IL-12-induced Stat4 activation participates in the Thi developmental program in CD4 * T cells ( Kaplan et al .
, 1996 ; Thierfelder et al .
, 1996 ) .
We propose that GATA-3 and IL-12 signaling exert mutually antagonistic effects on each other , with GATA-3 repressing IL-12RB2 expression and IL-12 signaling repressing GATA-3 expression .
This mechanism could explain why maintenance of GATA-3 during the first 7 days of Th1 induction leads to a significant inhibition of IFNy production .
Reexpression of GATA-3 on day 8 by retrovirus fails to reduce IFNy production , since the Stat4-dependent program that allows TCR-driven IFNy production in CD4 * T cells has already taken place .
Mutual repressive antagonism between paired signaling pathways is a common theme in lineage specification and development .
In Drosophila development , neuroec-toderm determination is influenced by Notch signaling , where a lateral inhibition mechanism of ligand expression and fate determination may stabilize local divergence of cell differentiation ( Artavanis-Tsakonas and Simpson , 1991 ; Greenwald and Rubin , 1992 ; Kopan and Cagan , 1997 ; Crowe et al .
, 1998 ; Rooke and Xu , 1998 ) .
Similar mechanisms potentially involving Notch participate in y8/ « f and CD4*/CD8 * T cell lineage divergences ( Robey and Fowlkes , 1998 ) .
Another example of repression in lineage specification appears in the molecular regulation of the and CD8* coreceptor genes during thymocyte maturation from double-positive precursors ( Sawada and Littman , 1991 ; Elimeier et al .
, 1997 ) .
In Th1/Th2 development , mutually antagonistic signals are seen at several levels .
At the gross cytokine level , IL-12 and IL-4 exert mutually antagonistic effects on their production .
A squelching mechanism between distinct STAT factors could underlie cross inhibition , but the immediate target genes influenced by Stat4 and Stat6 are not clearly identified at present .
This study provides evidence that GATA-3 and the IL-12 receptor pathway exert mutual antagonistic effects on each oth-er 's expression , representing an unstable situation that diverges to the stable dominance of one and extinction of the other , generating either a Thi or Th2 cytokine profile .
