A factor with apparently indistinguishable sequence specificity can be induced in many other cell types , where it is used to regulate inducible gene expression .
For example , xB-related sequences have been shown to be important for the transcription of a few inducible genes , such as the interleukin 2 receptor « -chain gene and the B-interferon gene .
However , these genes are not constitutively active in B lymphocytes , suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms must play a role in determining the patterns of expression .
We have investigated the constitutive and inducible transcriptional activity mediated by five B-related sequence elements in two different cell types .
We show that in $ 194 plasma cells the activity of each element correlates well with the relative affinity of B-cell-derived NF-xB for that element .
This leads to significantly lower transcription enhancement by sites derived from the interleukin 2 receptor or T-cell receptor genes in $ 194 cells .
However , in either EL-4 ( T ) cells or $ 194 cells , both lower-affinity sites can be significantly induced by the tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type I , showing that NF-xB activity can be modulated even in a B-cell line that constitutively expresses this factor .
B-cell-specific activity of the murine immunoglobulin x light-chain gene enhancer is directed by the xB sequence element ( GGGACTTTCC ) , which is a binding site for the transcription factor NF- « B ( 1-3 ) .
This factor is constitutively present in B-lymphoid cells and inducible in most other cell types by various stimuli ( 4-9 ) .
Recently , it has also been suggested that this factor may be further induced in B cells or in B-cell extracts ( 6 , 7 ) .
« B-related sequences have been found in other genes , where they are used to regulate inducible gene expression .
For example , such sequence elements mediate the induction of both the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) ( 10 ) and its receptor ( IL-2Ra ) ( 11-15 ) genes by the transactivator ( tax ) gene product of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-I ) ( 16 , 17 ) .
However , the « B-like sequence from the IL-2Ra gene ( IL-2Ra-B ) does not activate transcription efficiently in B cells ( 15 ) .
Similarly , we have shown that a DNA fragment containing the « B-like site from the T-cell receptor gene ( TCR $ B-B ) serves as a tax-inducible element in T cells but is inactive in NF- « B-containing B cells ( 18 ) .
To gain further insights into the regulation of transcription by NF- « B , we have compared five « B-like sequences in terms of their relative affinity for B-cell-derived NF- « B and their ability to activate transcription .
Our results show that the IL-2Ra-B and TCR # B-B sites have a significantly lower affin- The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

2141 ity for NF- « B compared to the x enhancer sequence , and this is reflected in inefficient transcriptional activation by these sequences in $ 194 plasma cells .
However , in the presence of HTLV-I tax gene product , even the lower-affinity sites show considerable activity in EL-4 T cells as well as $ 194 B cells , suggesting that the protein mediating the induced activity may be functionally different from B-cell-specific NF- « B and demonstrating that NF- « B function can be further modulated in B cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid Constructions .
Synthetic oligonucleotides , shown in Fig .
14 , and a mutated « B sequence ( m « B ; GATCAGAAT-TCACTTTCCGAGA ) , were cloned into the BamHI site of plasmid pTZ18U to generate plasmids pTZ ( B ) , pTZ ( IL2R ) , pTZ ( TCR ) , pTZ ( BG-C ) , and pTZ ( mB ) or into the Kpn I site of plasmid pTZ18U to generate plasmid pTZ ( H2K ) .
The ~40-base-pair ( bp ) Sma 1/Hincll restriction fragments from plasmids pTZ ( B ) , pTZ ( IL2R ) , pTZ ( TCR ) , pTZ ( BG-C ) pTZ ( mB ) or the 45-bp Sma I/EcoRI restriction fragment from plasmid pTZ ( H2K ) , filled in with Klenow fragment , were then sub-cloned into the Sma I site of plasmid pSPCAT ( 20 ) and into the Sal I site , filled in with Klenow fragment , of plasmid pfosA71 ( 21 ) .
Plasmids containing dimer insertions were selected and sequenced by the chain-termination method to determine the orientation of the xB-related sequences .
Mobility-Shift Assays and in Vitro Competitions .
The « B probe was prepared by cutting plasmid pTZ ( B ) with EcoRI , end-labeling with polynucleotide kinase , and recutting with HindIII .
EcoRI/HindIII fragments of pTZ18U , pTZ ( B ) , pTZ ( H2K ) , pTZ ( IL2R ) , pTZ ( TCR ) , and pTZ ( BG-C ) were used as competitor DNAs .
In vitro binding reactions and electrophoretic mobility-shift analysis were performed as described ( 1 ) with 2 ng of « B probe ( ~20,000 cpm ) , 10 ug of crude $ 194 nuclear extract , 2.5 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia ) , and increasing amounts ( 4-90 ng ) of competitor DNAs in a 20-ul final vol .
The band intensities of the resulting autoradiograms were quantified by two methods : densitometric scanning of short time exposures ( with the Bio-Rad video densitometer ; model 260 ) and spectrophotometric quantification of silver grains eluted from the autoradiograms ( 22 ) .
Cell Lines and DNA Transfections .
Three cell lines were used for transient transfection experiments : $ 194 , a murine myeloma ; Jurkat , a human T-cell line ; EL-4 , a murine T cell .
Culture conditions have been described ( 18 , 20 ) .
Transient transfections were performed by the DEAE-dextran method into 10 `` $ 194 cells ( in the absence of tax plasmid ) with 8 ug of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) -expressing plas- Abbreviations : IL-2Ra , interleukin 2 receptor a subunit ; TCRB-B , T-cell receptor 82 gene intron ; HTLV-I , human T-cell leukemia virus type I ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase .

In vitro binding of NF- « B present in B-cell nuclear extracts to « B-related sequence elements .
( A ) B-related sequences used in this study were derived from « B , IL-2Ra-B , TCRB-B , H2K-B , and « BG - C. ( B ) In vitro competition experiments with $ 194 B-cell extracts to determine the relative affinity of NF- « B for the various sequences .
Oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences shown in A were cloned into plasmid vectors and competitor fragments were isolated as described in Materials and Methods .
In vitro binding analysis was carried out with radioactive xB DNA in the presence of increasing amounts of the competitor DNAs followed by electrophoretic mobility-shift analysis .
After autoradiography , the band intensity of the nucleoprotein complex was quantified and is indicated on the y axis .
Concentration of competitor DNA ( in ng per 20 ul of reaction mixture ) is shown on the x axis .
( C ) Enlarged representation of competition assays with the higher-affinity sites .
Efficiency of each sequence as a competitor was estimated by comparing the levels needed to achieve 50 % reduction of complex formation and normalized to the B sequence from the x enhancer : « B , 100 % ; IL-2Ra-B , 8-10 % ; TCRB-B , 6-8 % ; H2K-B , 116 % ; « BG - C , 181 % .
mids and 2 ug of pCH110 that expresses the B-galactosidase gene ( 23 ) .
Extracts normalized to B-galactosidase activity were assayed for CAT activity in a two-phase assay based on the diffusion of tritiated acetylchloramphenicol into the scintillation fluid ( 24 ) .
Relative activity of the plasmid was determined by dividing the slope of the linear curve obtained for the plasmid by the slope of the linear curve obtained for the enhancerless plasmid .
Cotransfections with the HTLV-I tax-expressing plasmid pSRa-tax ( 25 ) were carried out in EL-4 , Jurkat , and $ 194 cells with 5 ug of each plasmid for 10 `` cells .
RESULTS The five related sequences being considered are shown in Fig .
14 .
Four are derived from the immunoglobulin x ( « B ) , MHC-H2K® ( H2K-B ) , TCRB ( TCR & -B ) , and IL-2Ra ( IL-2Ra-B ) genes .
The fifth sequence ( « BG - C ) is a single base alteration of the « B motif that we have previously shown ( 19 ) to bind both NF- « B and the ubiquitous factor H2TFI/KBF1 .
The relative affinity of each sequence for the constitutively present NF-KB in murine B cells was assessed by in vitro competition assays .
For best comparisons , binding reactions and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were carried out keeping the radioactive probe DNA ( « B sequence ) and the B-cell nuclear extract ( derived from $ 194 cells ) constant while varying the nonradioactive competitor DNA .
After nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography , the decrease in the intensity of the NF- « B-specific nucleoprotein complex in the presence of competitor DNA was estimated by densitometry and correlated with the amount of DNA used ( Fig .
1B ) .
In this range of competitor concentrations , a random fragment from pTZ18U ( competitor pTZ ) does not decrease the amount of NF- « B complex , whereas inclusion of any of the five « B-related sequences leads to a decrease of NF- « B binding to the probe .
However , the TCRB-B and IL-2Ra-B sequences clearly competed less efficiently than either the « B , H2K-B , or « BG - C sequences because much greater amounts of these DNA fragments were required to achieve an equivalent decrease in the NF-kB complex .
Estimation of either the slopes of the initial part of the curve or the amounts required to achieve a 50 % decrease in band intensity showed that the IL-2Ra-B and TCRB-B sequences competed 10- to 15-fold less efficiently than the xB sequence from the x enhancer .
Comparison of the three sequences that competed efficiently ( Fig .
1C ) showed that the « BG - > C sequence was better than either xB or H2K-B sequences , and we estimate this difference to be ~2-fold .
This pattern of binding affinities was reproducible in three independent sets of competition assays with two different preparations of competitor DNA fragments .
To check the ability of each sequence to activate transcrip-tion , two sets of plasmids carrying each element were analyzed by transient transfections into the murine plasma cell line $ 194 .
The five « B-related sequences were first cloned as dimers into the vector pSPCAT ( 20 ) ( Fig .
24 ) .
Multiple transfections into $ 194 cells showed that the « BG - C element ( Fig .
24 , line 6 ) directed the highest levels of CAT enzyme activity followed by the dB and H2K-B elements ( lines 2 and 3 , respectively ) .

directed lower activity than would have been expected based on its relatively high affinity for NF- « B , and we have not further investigated the basis for this difference .
Interestingly , p ( IL2R ) 2 CAT and p ( TCR ) 2 CAT plasmids showed no detectable activity above the background contributed by pSPCAT .
Because the « B sequence directed only 4- to 6-fold activity above pSPCAT , analysis with this set of plasmids did not Proc .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) 2143 allow us to distinguish whether inactivity of p ( IL-2R ) 2CAT and p ( TCR ) 2CAT was due to the requirement for a threshold affinity for NF-kB to activate a particular sequence or because the activity of these plasmids was 10-fold lower than the activity of p ( B ) 2 CAT and therefore could not be measured in this assay .
To circumvent this problem , a second set of plasmids was constructed with the same set of sequences to activate a truncated c-fos gene promoter ( 21 ) ( Fig .
2B ) .
Transfection of these plasmids into $ 194 cells showed that , in this context , all plasmids were able to direct transcriptional activation above the promoter background ( Fig .
2B ) .
As before , the highest activity was obtained with the « BG - > C sequence ( ~18-fold above the background of the promoter alone ) ; the xB ( ~10-fold above ) and H2K-B sequences ( ~12-fold above ) directed comparable CAT activity [ showing that the low activity of plasmid p ( H2K ) 2 CAT ( Fig .
24 ) was not because of an inhibitory effect of the H2K-B sequence itself ] and both the IL-2Ra-B and TCR # 3-B elements showed de-tectable , although low , activity above the background contributed by the promoter alone ( ~3-fold and 1.5-fold above , respectively ) .
Results of transfections with the c-fos promot-er-based plasmids were normalized to a cotransfected B-galactosidase-expressing plasmid pCH110 ( 23 ) and the CAT enzyme activity was determined by a two-phase assay that allowed continuous monitoring of the reaction so that small differences could be reliably estimated .
These results suggest that within the 15- to 20-fold affinity range of « B-related sequences examined here , the affinity of a site for NF-kB correlates well with its ability to direct transcription in B cells .
Multimerized IL-2Ra sites ( 11 , 14 ) as well as a dimer of the TCR # site ( 18 ) have been shown to confer HTLV-I tax-inducible transcription in Jurkat ( T ) cells .
However , in those experiments , activity of the same plasmids in B-cell lines was not examined .
Therefore , it is not clear how a particular sequence responds to the presence of constitutive NF-KB compared to fax-induced NF-kB .
To extend the previous analysis in Jurkat cells and to better compare tax-inducible transcription mediated by « B-related sequences , we transfected murine EL-4 cells with the pSPCAT-derived plasmids .
[ The c-fos-derived plasmids could not be used in this assay because the remaining 71 bp of the c-fos promoter contain a strong fax-inducible element ( C.J .
and R.S .
, unpublished results ) ; this effect is perhaps mediated by the cAMP responsive element located between residues -59 and -71 ( 26 ) . ]
As expected , in the absence of tax , all plasmids showed equivalent basal level activity .
Cotransfection with the tax-expressing plasmid , pSRa-tax , induced transcription of plasmids containing IL-2Ra-B as well as elements but not one containing a mutated « B element ( Fig .
34 ) .
Thus , even p ( IL2R ) 2CAT and p ( TCR ) 2CAT , which were inactive in NF- « B-containing B cells , were quite active in EL-4 cells in the presence of HTLV-I tax .
It is interesting to note that although the high-affinity « B site directed the greatest activ-ity , plasmids containing the lower-affinity sites were at most 2-fold less active .
This result contrasts with the roughly 4 and 6-fold lower activities of pfos ( IL2R ) 2CAT and pfos ( TCR ) 2CAT compared to pfos ( B ) 2CAT in B cells and suggests that the rax-inducible NF-KB activity in EL-4 cells was less affected by sequence differences .
To check whether tax could also modulate NF- « B function in B cells , the pSPCAT-based plasmids were cotransfected with a srax-expressing plasmid into $ 194 plasma cells .
Sur-prisingly , under these conditions , the previously inactive TCRB-B- and IL-2Ra-B-dependent plasmids were induced significantly , becoming as active as the « B-dependent plasmid ( Fig .
3B ) .
As observed in EL-4 cells , a mutant « B element [ ( mB ) 2CAT ] displayed insignificant activity in the presence of tax , showing that induction was dependent on the « B-related sequences in the other plasmids .

USA 88 ( 1991 ) served between the relative binding affinity of a sequence for NF- « B and its ability to activate transcription in $ 194 cells appears to break down in the presence of HTLV-I tax .
DISCUSSION We have shown that the affinity of B-cell-derived NF- « B for kB-related sequences correlates with the ability of these sequences to activate transcription in $ 194 murine plasma cells .
For example , the IL-2Ra-B and TCRB-B motifs are bound by NF- « B 10- to 15-fold more weakly than the « B site and they activate transcription 4- to 7-fold less .
One interpretation of this pattern of affinity and expression is that NF- « B levels are limiting in $ 194 cells .
Thus , higher-affinity sites are able to more efficiently utilize a restricted amount of the transcription factor to activate gene expression .
Our observation that a dimer of the IL-2Ra-B site is a poor activator of transcription in $ 194 cells is consistent with an earlier report that showed that a fragment of the IL-2Ra gene containing the IL-2Ra-B site was unable to activate transcription in $ 194 cells .
However , in contrast to the explanation proposed by Cross et al .
( 15 ) , we suggest that this observation can be readily explained by the significantly lower affinity of the sequence for B-cell-derived NF-kB .
Furthermore , both sequences ( IL-2Ra-B and TCRRB-B ) that have a relatively low affinity for NF- « B , and presumably therefore do not confer transcriptional activity in $ 194 cells , can be activated in Jurkat ( refs .
11 , 14 , and 18 ; data not shown ) and EL-4 T cells and $ 194 cells by the presence of HTLV-I tax .
We note an interesting similarity between the transcriptional activity of the complete IL-2Ra promoter and a dimer of the IL-2Ra-B site .
The IL-2Ra chain is present in low amounts on the surface of resting lymphocytes .
Activation of either T cells ( 27 , 28 ) or B cells ( 29-31 ) leads to much higher levels of surface expression of this protein .
In T cells , it has been demonstrated that induction occurs at the level of transcription initiation and it is quite likely that the same is true in B cells as well , suggesting that the IL-2Ra promoter is active in activated B cells .
The dimer of the IL-2Ra-B site mimics this pattern closely ; it is weakly active ( if at all ) in B and T cells constitutively ; however , upon cellular activation ( e.g .
, by tax ) , transcriptional activity is strongly induced .
In most cell types , where NF- « B is not constitutively expressed , it is located in the cytoplasm complexed with an inhibitor protein I- « B , which prevents its nuclear localization and binding to DNA ( 32 ) .
Upon cellular activation , the NF- « B-I- « B complex is disrupted , allowing transport of the DNA binding protein to the nucleus and subsequent transcriptional activation ( 33 ) .
However , recent experiments have indicated that even in B cells , a certain amount of NF- « B is present as the inactive cytoplasmic complex .
For example , Lenardo et al .
( 6 ) showed that virus infection of human Namaiwa ( B ) cells led to higher levels of nuclear NF- « B than that found constitutively , and Visvanathan and Goodbourn ( 7 ) were able to induce the factor by treating whole cell extracts derived from Daudi cells with mild denaturants .
Furthermore , we have shown that activation of splenic B cells via the surface antigen receptor also induces NF- « B ( 37 ) .
These results suggest that , perhaps even in B cells , NF- « B could mediate inducible gene expression ( 34 ) .
Our results provide the first direct demonstration that , in spite of the constitutive presence of NF- « B in B-cell lines , transcription dependent on « B-like sequence elements can be further modulated in such cells and that HTLV-I tax is one of the agents capable of doing so .
The simplest interpretation of our observations is that the tax gene product activates the sequestered NF- « B present in B cells , leading to a larger pool of available transcription factor .
Once the levels of NF-KB are no longer limiting within Immunology : Mauxion et al .
the nucleus , the effect of affinity differences between « B-related sequences is decreased .
Alternatively , tax may induce a transcription factor ( in both T and B cells ) that is responsible for the effects we have observed .
This notion is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that xB homolo-gous sequence elements may bind a family of inducible DNA binding proteins ( 35 , 36 ) .
Finally , it is also possible that the tax-encoded protein ( and perhaps other signals ) , directly or indirectly , can cause a posttranslational modification of the preexisting NF- « B in B cells to generate a protein functionally different from the constitutive factor .
Our data , at present , do not allow us to distinguish between these models but serve to define a hitherto unknown facet of transcription regulation by NF- « B-like factors as well as HTLV-I tax .
