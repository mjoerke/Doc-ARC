Dual Action of Retinoic Acid on Human Embryonic/Fetal Hematopoiesis : Blockade of Primitive Progenitor Proliferation and Shift From Multipotent/ Erythroid/Monocytic to Granulocytic Differentiation Program By Angelo Tocci , Isabella Parolini , Marco Gabbianelli , Ugo Testa , Luisella Luchetti , Paola Samoggia , Barbara Masella , Giovanni Russo , Mauro Valtieri , and Cesare Peschle In preliminary studies , we have analyzed the hematopoietic growth factor ( HGF ) requirement of hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPCs ) purified from embryonic-fetal liver ( FL ) and grown in fetal calf serum-supplemented ( FCS* ) clonogenic culture .
The key role of erythropoietin ( Epo ) for colony formation by early erythroid progenitors ( burst-forming units-erythroid [ BFU-E ) ) has been confirmed .
Furthermore , in the absence of exogenous HGFs , FL monocytic progenitors ( colony-forming unit monocyte [ CFU-M } ) generate large colonies exclusively composed of monocytes-macrophages ; these colonies are absent in FCS~ clonogenic culture .
On this basis , we have investigated the role of all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and its isomer 9-cis RA in FL hematopoiesis .
Both compounds modulate the growth of purified FL HPCs , which show a dose-dependent shift from mixed/erythroid/ monocytic to granulocytic colony formation .
Studies on unicellular and paired daughter cell culture unequivocally indicate that the shift is mediated by modulation of the HPC differentiation program to the granulopoietic pathway { rather than RA-induced downmodulation of multipotent/ erythroid/monocytic HPC growth coupled with recruitment MBRYONIC-FETAL LIVER ( FL ) cells comprise diverse hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPCs ) , ie , erythroid ( burst-forming unit-erythroid [ BFU-E ] ) , granulomonocytic ( colony-forming unit-GM - [ CFU-GMJ ) , and multipotent progenitors ( CFU-GEMM ) , as indicated by in vitro clonogenic assay . ``
In vivo , however , FL HPCs differentiate almost exclusively along the erythroid pathway . ``
Inter-estingly , the requirement for hematopoietic growth factors ( HGFs ) , also termed interleukins ( ILs ) or colony-stimulating factors ( CSFs ) , of FL HPCs differs from that of corresponding adult HPCs : thus , FL HPCs stimulated with erythropoietin ( Epo ) alone under stringent fetal calf serum-free ( FCS _ ) culture conditions generate an optimal number of erythroid bursts , which is not significantly enhanced by the combined addition of multilineage HGF ( s ) ( IL-3 and/or GM-CSF ) .
`` * Furthermore , FL HPCs show a higher cycling activity and a shorter doubling time than their adult counterparts , `` which underlie the rapid expansion of their pool size . ``

ATRA and 9-cis RA also exert their effect on the proliferation of primitive HPCs ( high-prolifera-tive potential colony-forming cells [ HPP-CFCs } ) and putative hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ; assayed in Dexter-type long-term culture ) .
High concentrations of either compound ( 1 ) drastically reduced the number of primary HPP-CFC colonies and totally abolished their recloning capacity and ( 2 ) inhibited HSC proliferation .
It is crucial that these results mirror recent observations indicating that murine adult HPCs transduced with dominant negative ATRA receptor ( RAR ) gene are immortalized and show a selective blockade of granulocytic differentiation .
Altogether , these results suggest that ATRA/9-cis RA may play a key role in FL hematopoiesis via a dual effect hypothetically mediated by interaction with the RAR/RXR heterodimer , ie , inhibition of HSC/ primitive HPC proliferation and induction of CFU-GEMM/ BFU-E/CFU-M shift from the multipotent/erythroid/monocytic to the granulocytic-neutrophilic differentiation program .

topoietic cells . ``
In particular , ATRA induces granulocytic differentiation of acute myeloblastic and promyelocytic leukemia ( AML and APL ) cell lines ( eg , HL-60 , AML-193 , NB4 ) , *° as well as APL blasts in vivo . ``
A significant role for retinoids in the immunologic system is suggested by the impaired humoral and cellular immune responses in vitamin A-deficient mice . ``
ATRA is also an important morphogen in vertebrate development : ( 1 ) in chick embryonal limbs , endogenous ATRA gradients underlie pattern formation and ( 2 ) in mouse embryos , perturbation of ATRA concentrations leads to disruptive morphological alterations and homeotic transformations . ``
In vitro ATRA induces differentiation of human teratocarcinoma cells and coordinate expression of homeobox-containing genes . ``
Previous studies performed on unpurified human and avian bone marrow ( BM ) HPCs showed a stimulatory and inhibitory effect on granulocytic and erythroid differentiation respectively . ``
However , the possibility could not be excluded that accessory cells coplated with HPCs had modified ATRA metabolism and/or its effect via HGF ( s ) released in culture .
In view of these uncertainties , we analyzed the ATRA action on highly purified HPCs from normal adult peripheral blood ( PB ) . ``
'' `` `` These studies showed that ATRA inhibits erythroid and stimulates granulocytic neutrophilic differentiation , suggesting , but not proving , that ATRA induces an HPC shift from erythroid to granulocytic neutro-philic-differentiation program . ``
'' Furthermore , this effect was coupled with and possibly mediated by downmodulation of the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1'® and NF-E2 . ``

RETINOIC ACID AND HEMATOPOIESIS ( the studies have been performed in both bulk and unicellular clonogenic cultures , including paired daughter cell analysis ) ; and ( 3 ) the effects of ATRA and 9-cis RA at the level of primitive HPCs ( HPP-CFC assay ) and putative hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC 's ; as evaluated by the number of HPCs generated after 5 weeks in Dexter-type long-term culture [ LTC ] ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS HGFs and Chemical Inducers The following recombinant human HGFs were used : IL-3 and GM-CSF ( 1.7 to 2.5 x 10° U/mg ; The Genetics Institute , Cambridge , MA ) ; Epo and c-kit ligand ( KL ; Amgen , Thousand Oaks , CA , and Immunex , Seattle , WA ) ; and G-CSF and M-CSF ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) .
ATRA was obtained from Sigma ( St Louis , MO ) , and 9-cis RA and vitamin D3 ( 1a 25-OH-VitD3 ) were from Roche Co ( Basel , Switzerland ) .
Cell Purification and Phenotype Analysis FL samples were obtained from spontaneously aborted fetuses ( 6 to 10 weeks gestation ) , after informed consent of the mothers , and dissected within 3 hours of delivery .
A single-cell suspension was obtained by serial passage through 19- , 21- , and 22.5-gauge needles .
Cells were washed and diluted in FCS~ culture medium containing Iscove 's modified Dulbecco 's medium ( IMDM ; Hyclone , Logan , UT ) , bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; 10 mg/mL ) , pure human transferrin ( 1 mg/mL ) , human low-density lipoproteins ( 40 ug/mL ) , insulin ( 10 ug/mL ) , sodium pyruvate ( 10~* mol/L ) , L-glutamine ( 2 x 10~ > mol/L ) , rare inorganic elements'* supplemented with iron sul-phate ( 4 x 10~° mol/L ) , and nucleosides ( 10 pg/mL of each ; all from Sigma ) .
Cells ( 10° cells/mL ) were incubated overnight in T 12.5 flasks ( Falcon ; Becton Dickinson BD , Oxnard , CA ) at 37°C in a 5 % CO ; , fully humidified atmosphere .
The suspension was then centrifuged at 100g for 10 minutes to separate hepatocytes from hematopoietic cells .
Cell viability was always higher than 95 % as assessed by trypan-blue dye exclusion test .
Two different protocols were used for HPC enrichment .
Protocol A .
- Cell suspension was fractionated by centrifugation through a Ficoll density gradient ( d = 1.077 ) ; the resulting cell suspension was washed twice and labelled with a phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ; anti-HPCA2 ; Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
The labeled cell suspension was sorted by FACScan ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Protocol B .
- Cell suspension was fractionated by centrifugation through a Percoll density gradient ( d = 1.080 ) .
CD34* cells were further separated by a magnetic cell separator ( MACS ; Miltenyl Biotech , Sunnyvale , CA ) and the MACS CD34 isolation kit , essentially composed by a modified anti-CD34 MoAb QBend/10 ( anti-HPCA1 epitope ; mouse IgG1 , reagent A ) and colloidal superpara-magnetic microbeads recognizing the anti-CD34 MoAb ( reagent B ) .
Briefly , 20 L of reagent A was added to 10 ' nucleated cells and incubated at 4°C for 15 minutes in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) with 2 % BSA .
Cells were washed once and labeled with reagent B .
After 15 minutes at 4°C , cells were separated .
Columns introduced in a magnetic field were washed with PBS and 2 % BSA .
Labeled cells were applied , and unbound cells were washed out with 1.5 mL of PBS/BSA .
Columns were removed from the magnetic field and the bound cells were eluted .
This procedure was repeated twice .
Eluted cells were collected in a sterile tube and counted in a hemocy-tometer .
To control the efficacy of the separation procedure , staining was performed by reacting the eluted cells with a PE-conjugated anti-CD34 MoAb ( anti-HPCA2 ) , which recognized a different epi-tope than reagent A. Single-color fluorescence was analyzed by 2879 FACScan flow cytometer .
Data from 5,000 to 10,000 cells were collected and analyzed using the Lysis program ( Becton Dickinson ) with appropriate gates to exclude cellular debris and aggregates .
Clonogenic Assay : ATRA or 9-cis RA Effects on Enriched HPCs Enriched HPCs were seeded ( 1 x 10° cells/mL/dish , 2 or 3 plates per point ) and cultured in 0.9 % methylcellulose , 40 % FCS in IMDM supplemented with a-thioglycerol ( 10~* mmol/L ) , 10 pg/mL ferric ammonium citrate , 1 mg/mL pure human transferrin ( all from Sigma ) , and different HGFs as detailed below ( see also Gabbianelli et al `` and Craig et al `` ) at 37°C in a 5 % COY/S5 % 0 , ; /90 % N , humidified atmosphere .
Cultures were supplemented with KL ( 100 ng/mL ) , IL-3 ( 100 U ) , GM-CSF ( 10 ng ) , and Epo ( 3 U ) in various combinations .
BFU-E , CFU-GM , CFU-M , CFU-G , and CFU-GEMM colonies were scored on days 10 to 12 . '
'' In selected experiments , single colonies were picked up , smeared onto glass slides by cytospin centrifugation and stained with May-Griinwald Giemsa ( Sigma ) , which allowed for the confirmation of colony identification by visual inspection and the inclusion of CFU-GM colonies into a CFU-G or CFU-M group , as related to their prevalent granulocytic or monocytic cell composition , respectively ( see Results ) .
An immunoperoxidase kit was used for CFU-M colony characterization ( DAKO , Carpinteria , CA ) .
Briefly , smears were fixed in ace-tone-methanol ( 3:1 ) for 20 minutes , maintained in buffer for 5 minutes and in 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 5 minutes .
Smears were then treated with peroxidase blocking reagent , which was washed off after 5 minutes ; thereafter , anti-CD14 MoAb ( Becton Dickinson , Oxnard , CA ) , or the negative control reagent , was applied .
After 60 minutes , smears were rinsed and the biotinylated secondary antibody was applied for 20 minutes .
Smears were then incubated with immunoperoxidase for 20 minutes and rinsed .
The substrate reagent was applied for 10 minutes , then smears were rinsed , mounted , and analyzed under a microscope .
Experiments were performed using enriched HPCs obtained by the two enrichment protocols described above .
Protocol A .
- In these experiments , ATRA ( 107 to 107 `` mol/L ) was added to FCS* clonogenic cultures with addition of various combinations of exogenous HGFs .
Protocol B .
Various concentrations ( 10~° to 107 `` mol/L ) of ATRA or 9-cis RA were added to FCS* clonogenic cultures supplemented with an optimal combination of exogenous HGFs .
In time-response experiments , ATRA was supplemented either on day 0 or at sequential days thereafter to optimal growth clonogenic cultures .
Furthermore , ATRA was added to unicellular cultures ( 0.5 cells/ well ) in FCS* liquid medium supplemented with saturating exogenous HGFs .
ATRA Effects in Unicellular Culture of HPCs and HPC-Derived Paired Daughter Cells Unicellular cultures were performed in flat-bottomed 96-micro-well plates in 0.1 mL of FCS* medium supplemented with saturating levels of all HGFs supplemented in semisolid culture ( see above ) combined or not with ATRA ( 107° mol/L ) .
Cells were seeded at 0.5 cell/well density .
After 10 to 12 days , single colonies were scored , picked-up , and smeared on glass slides for morphology analysis .
In the paired sibling cell assay , 0.5 cell/well was plated in 0.1 mL of FCS* medium containing saturating levels of HGFs as indicated above .
At day 1 to 2 , paired sibling cells were identified , picked up by a micromanipulator , and seeded in two sibling wells containing 0.1 mL of the same medium treated or not with ATRA ( 10~® mol/L ) .
After 10 to 12 days , colonies were scored and analyzed as described above .

2880 HPP-CFC Assay The frequency of HPP-CFCs was evaluated as previously de-scribed . ``
'' `` ' Briefly , 100 enriched HPCs ( purification protocol B ) were added to 1 mL of culture medium composed of 40 % FCS and 0.9 % methylcellulose in IMDM supplemented with a-thioglycerol ( 107* mol/L ) , pure human transferrin ( 1 mg/mL ) and ferric ammonium citrate ( 10 ug/mL ) .
The following HGFs were added : KL ( 100 ng/mL ) IL-3 ( 100 U/mL ) , GM-CSF ( 10 ng/mL ) , G-CSF ( 500 U/ mL ) , M-CSF ( 500 U/mL ) , Epo ( 3 U/mL ) .
Cells were incubated at 37°C in a fully humidified 5 % CO , , 5 % O ; , 90 % N ; atmosphere .
HPP-CFC-derived colonies were scored at days 24 to 28 based on a diameter greater than 0.5 mm as already established . ``
'' Single HPP-CFC colonies were picked up by direct microscopic visualization using a sterile 100-4uL glass micropipette , suspended in 0.2 mL IMDM , and clonally replated in single Petri dishes .
Secondary HPP-CFEC-derived colonies scored 24 to 28 days later were analyzed for morphology as described above .
Dexter-Type LTC Methodology for Dexter-type LTC `` has been modified as fol-lows .
Briefly , the BM aspirate Ficoll-Hypaque cut was inoculated ( 1.5 to 2 X 10° cells/mL ) in 25-cm `` tissue culture flasks ( Falcon ; Becton Dickinson , Plymouth , UK ) in 10 mL total volume comprising 10 % preselected FCS ( GIBCO ) , 10 % preselected horse serum ( GIBCO ) , and 5 x 10~ mol/L hydrocortisone hemisuccinate ( Sigma ) in IMDM .
The cultures were incubated in a 5 % CO ; fully humidified atmosphere at 33°C .
After formation of a confluent layer in 2 to 4 weeks , the flasks were exposed to 15 Gy to ablate endogenous BM hematopoiesis , the adherent layer was detached by trypsin-EDTA ( GIBCO ) treatment , washed , and replated in 24-well plates ( 1 x 10° cells/mL/ well ) in the above culture medium .
After 24 to 48 hours , Dexter-type mini-LTCs® ' were started by addition of 1.5 x 10° FL CD34* cells/well .
The mini-LTCs were supplemented or not with ATRA or 9-cis RA .
Half of the medium was replaced weekly by fresh medium supplemented or not with ATRA or 9-cis RA .
The cultures were terminated by enzymatic treatment with trypsin-EDTA after 5 weeks .
The HPCs in the nonadherent and adherent fraction were assayed in clonogenic culture ( see above ) .
RESULTS Enrichment and HGF Requirements of FL HPCs Enrichment level , as assessed by phenotypic reanalysis of the CD34 antigen , was comparable for both protocols A and B ( 85.7 + 3.6 and 86.8 + 3.4 CD34* cells respectively : mean + standard error of mean [ SEM ] values from three separate representative experiments ) .
Fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) analysis of a representative protocol B experiment is shown in Fig 1 .
Both methodologies provided a similar HPC frequency ( range , 30 % to 80 % , see Figs 2 through 5 , Tables 1 and 2 ) , but protocol B allowed a more abundant HPC yield ( 51.8 % v 29.5 % for protocol B v A , as evaluated with respect to HPC number in the Ficoll fraction ) .
Using protocol A , clonogenic experiments were performed to identify the optimal HGF combination for FL HPC colony growth in FCS* semisolid cultures ( Fig 2 ) .
FCS alone supported formation of only CFU-M colonies : the monocyte-macrophage colony composition was confirmed not only by morphology , but also anti-CD14 immunoperoxidase analysis ( using the latter technique , granulocytic cells are only slightly labeled , while monocytes-macro- TOCCI ET AL phages are intensively positive ) .
Epo addition stimulated BFU-E colony formation ( see also Valtieri et al `` ) , but did not significantly modify the number of CFU-M colonies .
Further addition of IL-3 and GM-CSF mildly increased the number of BFU-E and CFU-M colonies , but markedly enhanced their colony size ( results not shown ) , as reported in Valtieri et al `` ; this HGF combination also induced pure CFU-G colonies and CFU-GM clones with prevalent monocytic content , which were scored as CFU-M clones ( Figs 2 through 5 and text ; see also below ) .
KL added together with Epo , IL-3 , and GM-CSF moderately stimulated CFU-GEMM colony formation and increased the size of all other colony types ( not shown ) , but did not significantly modify the total number of colonies .
Thus , optimal growth of enriched HPCs was demonstrated in the presence of KL ( 100 or 10 ng/mL ) , IL-3 ( 100 U ) , GM-CSF ( 10 ng ) , and Epo ( 3 U ) ( Figs 2 and 3 ) , as confirmed with HPCs purified using protocol B ( Figs 4 and 5 ) .
Effect of ATRA and 9-cis RA on Purified FL HPCs in Clonogenic Cultures Preliminary ATRA dose/response experiments on FL HPCs purified by protocol A and grown in semisolid culture indicated that the saturating ATRA dosage was 10~ ' to 10~° mol/L ( results not shown , see also below ) .
Figure 2 shows the effects of diverse combinations of HGFs at saturating levels and ATRA ( 107 mol/L ) in purified FL HPC clonogenic culture : ( 1 ) in absence of exogenous HGFs , addition of ATRA totally abolished CFU-M colony formation ; ( 2 ) in the presence of Epo alone , both BFU-E and CFU-M colonies were suppressed ; ( 3 ) when multilineage HGFs were supple-mented , ATRA dramatically increased the number of CFU-G colonies ( these included a minority [ < 1 of 3 ] of CFU-GM clones composed of ~85 % granulocytic cells , which were thus scored as CFU-G colonies ) , while inhibiting formation of both BFU-E ( including a few CFU-GEMM ) and CFU-M colonies ( the latter comprised a minority [ < 1 of 3 ] of CFU-GM clones containing ~70 % to 75 % monocytic cells , which were thus scored as CFU-M colonies ) ; ( 4 ) simi-larly , in experiments with IL-3 , GM-CSF , and KL , addition of ATRA sharply increased the number of CFU-G colonies and inhibited that of both BFU-E/CFU-GEMM and CFU-M ( the incidence and composition of CFU-GM clones was as in [ 3 ] ) ; ( 5 ) it is also noteworthy that the ATRA-induced inhibition of BFU-E and CFU-M growth was dose-dependent ( Table 1 , see also below ) .
In selected experiments , colonies were individually picked up , smeared onto glass slides , stained , and cell composition analyzed .
As expected , CFU-G and CFU-M colonies were entirely composed of granulocytic and monocytic cells , respectively .
In a representative experiment , control CFU-GM colonies ( n = 6 ) comprised 86 % + 5.1 % ( mean + SEM ) monocytic and 14 % + 5.1 % granulocytic cells , whereas CFU-GM colonies ( n = 6 ) treated with 10~° mol/L ATRA were composed of 25 % + 4.6 % monocytic and 75 % + 4.6 % granulocytic cells .
Similar results were obtained picking up CFU-GM colonies from duplicate dishes ( data not shown ) .

To assess the level at which ATRA exerted its effects , ATRA ( 107° mol/L ) was added either on day 0 or with a delay of 2 , 4 , 6 , or 8 days to clonogenic cultures performed under optimal growth conditions ( Fig 3 ) .
Day 0 addition of ATRA induced a significant modulation of FL HPC prolifer-ation/differentiation , whereas delayed ATRA addition had little or no effect at early or late culture days respectively , thus suggesting that the ATRA effect is mainly exerted on HPCs at initial stages of HPC differentiation .
Here again , CFU-G and CFU-M colonies comprised < 30 % CFU-GM clones mainly composed of granulocytic cells ( scored as CFU-G colonies ) and monocytic cells ( scored as CFU-M colonies ) , respectively .

CFU-GEMM colonies present in KL-treated cultures were cumulated with the prevailing BFU-E colonies .
Few CFU-GM colonies were present ( see Results } : they comprised 85 % monocytic cells in the absence of ATRA and were scored as `` CFU-M , `` while they were composed of 70 % to 75 % granulocytic cells when ATRA was added and were scored as `` CFU-G `` { see Results ) .

FL HPCs were purified using method A. of ATRA or 9-cis RA markedly reduced the number of BFU-E/CFU-GEMM and CFU-M clones and significantly increased the number of CFU-G colonies under optimal culture conditions ; ( 2 ) this effect was dose-dependent and fully exerted starting at 10~ ' mol/L for both retinoids ; ( 3 ) neither retinoid significantly modified the total number of colonies .
The frequency of CFU-GM colonies predominantly granulocytic ( scored as CFU-G ) and predominantly monocytic ( scored as CFU-M ) was similar to that observed in the experiments described above .
Effect of ATRA on HPC Unicellular Culture To avoid the bias of coplated accessory cells , we added 10~° mol/L ATRA to unicellular FCS* culture ( 0.5 cells/ well ) , stimulated by saturating levels of KL , IL-3 , GM-CSF , and Epo .
In a representative experiment ( Table 2 ) with 80 % cloning efficiency , ATRA dramatically reduced the number of BFU-E and CFU-M colonies and conversely increased the number of CFU-G colonies .
The incidence of CFU-GM colonies predominantly granulocytic ( scored as CFU-G ) and monocytic ( scored as CFU-M ) was similar to that in the above described experiments .
Effect of ATRA on Paired Daughter Cell Culture In a final series of studies , we analyzed the effects of ATRA on paired daughter cells separately grown in unicellular cultures ( 0.5 cells/well ) using an optimal HGF stimulus ( Table 3 shows the cumulative results of three independent experiments ) .
( 1 ) Control experiments : to assess the possibility of asymmetric divisions , control cultures were performed with no ATRA addition in the two sibling wells .
Under these experimental conditions , asymmetric divisions were not observed ( except for a mixed v monocytic colony ) ; ( 2 ) ATRA treatment studies : ATRA~ sibling wells mostly contained erythroid or monocytic colonies ; a few wells comprised mixed , granulomonocytic , or granulocytic clones ( predominantly eosinophilic ) ; other ones contained abortive colonies , which hypothetically had undergone apoptosis .
Strikingly , ATRA* sibling wells always contained either granulocytic ( predominantly neutrophilic ) or abortive colonies : particu-larly , ATRA~ erythroid , monocytic , granulomonocytic or mixed sibling colonies corresponded to ATRA * granulocytic or abortive sibling colonies .
Effect of ATRA and 9-cis RA on Purified FL HPP-CFCs To further clarify the level at which ATRA exerts its effects , we analyzed the effect of ATRA treatment on primitive HPCs defined as HPP-CFCs ( Fig 6 ) .
Experiments performed upon addition of saturating amounts of KL , IL-3 , GM-CSF , G-CSF , M-CSF , Epo to FCS* culture medium demonstrated that ( 1 ) the majority of colonies morphologi-cally and functionally defined as HPP-CFC-derived clones ( ie , > 0.5 mm in diameter and with recloning potential ) displayed a pure monocytic morphology , while ( 2 ) a minority displayed a granulomonocytic composition .
( 3 ) It is also noteworthy that few primary colonies of large size and erythroid or granulocytic morphology were observed : these col From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

RETINOIC ACID AND HEMATOPOIESIS onies gave rise to only a few clusters in secondary culture and , therefore , were not considered as HPP-CFC-derived .
Starting at the 10~ ' mol/L dose , ATRA drastically reduced the number of primary HPP-CFC colonies and totally abolished their recloning capability ( Fig 6 ) .
Similar results were obtained with 9-cis RA ( not shown ) .
Effect of ATRA and 9-cis RA on FL Dexter-Type LTC In 5- to 8-week adult LTC , the number of HPCs is directly related to the number of LTC-initiating cells ( LTC-ICs ) , which are considered to represent putative HSCs . ``

Dose-response of 9-cis RA on purified FL HPCs cloned in FCS* semisolid medium supplemented with Epo , IL-3 , GM-CSF , KL ( see legend to Fig 2 ) .
Few CFU-GM colonies were scored ( see Re-sults ) : 9-cis RA treatment caused a dose-related , gradual switch of CFU-GM clones from a predominantly monocytic to a mainly granulocytic cell composition ( CFU-GM colonies predominantly monocytic or granulocytic were scored as CFU-M and CFU-G , respectively , see legend to Fig 2 and Results ) .
Mean + SEM values from three separate experiments performed in duplicate dishes .
*P = .05 , **P < .01 when comparing ATRA* versus ATRA~ control cultures .
Purified FL HPCs were obtained using method B ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The growth of a significant number of CFU-M colonies is FCS-mediated , in that it is absent in serum-free cultures ( results not shown ) , but consistent in FCS* cultures supplemented or not with exogeneous HGFs .
Furthermore , this observation is in line with our findings on adult HPC monocytic differentiation in liquid suspension culture ' : thus , while adult HPCs require defined HGF combinations to develop unilineage erythroid , granulocytic , or megakaryotic progeny in FCS~ culture condition , `` `` the HPC unilineage monocytic differentiation system requires not only treatment with a specific HGF combination ( M-CSF + FLT3 ligand ) , but also FCS addition . ``
The FCS requirement for monocyto-poietic cell growth is seemingly mediated by serum-borne nutritional component ( s ) and/or HGF ( s ) .
In unpurified murine FL cells , selected HPCs similarly generate pure monocytic colonies in FCS* clonogenic culture . ``
'' In FCS* culture , IL-3 and GM-CSF addition induced a borderline increase of the number and a marked rise of the TOCCI ET AL size of BFU-E ( see Valtieri et al `` ) and CFU-M colonies , while inducing formation of a few CFU-GEMM clones and a small number of CFU-GM colonies largely composed of monocytic cells and scored as CFU-M clones .
Further addition of KL enhanced the formation of CFU-GEMM colonies and increased the size of all the other colony types without modifying the total number of colonies : similar results have been obtained in purified adult HPC semisolid culture `` `` ( results not shown ) .
We also describe FL primitive progenitors defined as HPP-CFCs , which display features corresponding to those of adult HPP-CFCs , `` `` `` ' except that FL HPP-CFCs generate a progeny with almost pure monocytic morphology .
The effects of retinoids on FL HPCs are dose-related and feature a drastic decrease of BFU-E/CFU-GEMM and CFU-M colonies combined with a marked rise of the CFU-G clones .
ATRA~ cultures also comprised a minority of CFU-GM colonies with prevailing monocytic content ( scored as CFU-M clones ) , while ATRA* cultures comprised a few CFU-GM colonies largely composed of granulocytic cells ( scored as CFU-G clones ) ; thus , CFU-GM colonies showed a subtotal switch from predominantly monocytic to mainly granulocytic cell composition .
We suggest that these phenomena are mediated by an erythroid/monocytic to granulocytic shift of the HPC differentiation program .
Alternatively , these phenomena might be attributed to growth inhibition of BFU-E/CFU-GEMM and CFU-M colonies ( comprising CFU-GM clones predominantly monocytic ) combined with recruitment of CFU-G colonies ( including CFU-GM clones predominantly granulocytic ) ; however , this hypothesis contrasts with a series of observations .
Thus , ( 1 ) the total number of colonies is not significantly modified by retinoid addition , ( 2 ) unicellular culture results are not compatible with the recruitment hypothesis , ie , the increase in number of CFU-G clones in ATRA* culture is larger than the number of nonclonogenic cells in ATRA~ culture ; and finally , ( 3 ) studies on paired daughter cells show that generation of an erythroid , monocytic , granulo-monocytic , or mixed colony by a sibling in ATRA~ culture is coupled with generation of a granulocytic colony in ATRA * culture by the other sibling ( control paired daughter cell cultures performed under the same conditions without ATRA addition excluded asymmetrical divisions ) .
Altogether , these studies conclusively dem Table 1 .

onstrated a specific effect of ATRA to reprogram the differentiation program of FL HPCs to enter the granulopoietic pathway .
The ATRA induction of CFU-G colonies requires the presence of not only Epo , but also IL-3 and GM-CSF .
It is possible that , upon addition of Epo alone , the HPCs reprogrammed by ATRA to generate CFU-G colonies may undergo apoptosis , due to the absence of multilineage HGFs . ``
It is also noteworthy that the ATRA and 9-cis RA effects may be partly mediated by binding of retinoids with FCS carrier protein ( s ) , as observed in vivo . ``
We previously showed that ATRA addition on purified adult HPCs causes a downmodulation of erythroid burst formation coupled with an increase of CFU-G colony number , thus suggesting , but not proving , an erythroid to granulopoietic differentiation shift . ``
The novel results on FL shed light on this issue , in that they indicate a switch of HPCs from the erythroid or monocytic to the granulocytic-neutrophilic differentiation program .
We have also observed a striking effect of ATRA and 9-cis RA on the proliferation of early/primitive HPCs and putative HSCs ( the latters assayed on the basis of the number of HPCs generated in 5-week Dexter type LTC ) .
Thus , ( 1 ) in clonogenic HPC culture , the action of ATRA is maximal when this compound is added on freshly enriched HPCs and progressively decreases upon delayed ATRA addition : this indicates that early HPCs are the most sensitive ATRA tar-get , while later HPCs and early hematopoietic precursors become progressively unresponsive to ATRA .
( 2 ) High concentrations of ATRA drastically reduce the number of primary HPP-CFC-derived colonies and totally abolish their recloning capacity , thus indicating a suppressive role of ATRA on HPP-CFC proliferation/differentiation and apparently self-renewal .
( 3 ) High concentrations of either ATRA or 9-cis RA drastically reduce the number of HPCs in 5-week LTC .
Since in adult LTC limiting dilution experiments , the HPC number is directly related to the LTC-IC number , these results suggest an inhibitory effect of RA on the proliferation of FL HSC 's .
The biological effects of retinoids are mediated through specific interaction with nuclear receptor proteins , which pertain to the steroid receptor superfamily , function as li-gand-dependent regulators of gene transcription , and comprise the RAR and RXR subfamilies . ``
ATRA is the most potent transcriptional activator of RAR , but does not efficiently bind to RXR , **** while 9-cis RA represents the natural ligand for RXR .
`` * `` `` The RAR/RXR heterodimer exhibits a markedly higher affinity to the response elements , as compared with RAR or RAR/RAR homodimer . ``
Because we observed that both ATRA and 9-cis RA displayed identical Table 3 .

Morphological analysis on primary and secondary HPP-CFC was done on untreated cultures .
effect on FL HPC and HPP-CFC colony formation , we suggest that both molecules mediate their biological action on HPCs through binding with RAR/RXR heterodimer .
Further experiments with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( D3 ) on purified adult HPCs ( not shown here ) indicate that addition of this compound mimicks the inhibitory , but not the stimulatory effects , of ATRA , ie , it induces a dose-dependent inhibition of erythroid , monocytic , and HPP-CFC colony formation , but not an increase of granulocytic-neutrophilic colonies .
The biological activity of D3 is mediated through its interaction with specific nuclear receptors represented by either D3R homodimers or D3R/RXR heterodimers . ``
It may be hypothesized that the inhibitory effects on erythroid , monocytic and HPP-CFC colony formation may be originated through activation of either RAR/RXR of D3R/D3R-D3R/RXR , while the stimulatory activity on granulocytic colony formation could theoretically be described only to activation of RAR/RXR .
Our results on normal FL hematopoiesis indicate a two-level effect of RA on human embryonic/fetal HPC : ( 1 ) the inhibition of primitive HPC/HSC proliferation ; ( 2 ) the shift from erythroid and monocytic differentiation program to the granulocytic one .
These results strikingly mirror recent stud-ies `` indicating that S-fluorouracil-treated murine BM lymphoid-myeloid HPCs transduced with a dominant-negative RAR construct are ( 1 ) immortalized and ( 2 ) exhibit a developmental defect in the granulocytic lineage , ie , lack of CFU-GM colony generation and an additional more advanced block in neutrophilic differentiation at the promyelocytic level , `` `` which is overcome by treatment with high concentrations of ATRA .
It is of crucial interest that our results on human FL HPCs , together with studies on ATRA treatment of adult HPC 's , `` ° exactly mirror those by Tsai et al . ``
In conclusion , we propose that retinoids play a key role in primitive HPC proliferation and are essential for HPC neutrophilic differentiation .
