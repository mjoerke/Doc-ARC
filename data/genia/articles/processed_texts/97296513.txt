Seong* From the * Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics and Department of Molecular Biology , Seoul National University , Seoul 151-742 , Korea ; the *Laboratory of Immunology , Korea Cancer Center Hospital , Seoul 139-240 , Korea ; and the §Department of Molecular Biology , Dankook University , Seoul 140-714 , Korea Sum m ary We isolated a new mouse gene that is highly expressed in thymocytes , testis , and brain .
This gene , SRG3 , showed a significant sequence homology to SW T3 , a yeast transcriptional activator , and its human homolog BAFI55 .
SRG3 encodes 1,100 amino acids and has 33-47 % identity with SWI3 protein over three regions .
The SR G3 protein contains an acidic NH , terminus , a myb-like DNA binding domain , a leucine-zipper motif , and a proline- and glutamine-rich region at its COOH terminus .
R abbit antiserum raised against a COOH-terminal polypeptide of the SR G3 recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 155 kD .
The serum also detected a 170-kD protein that seems to be a mouse homologue of human BAF170 .
Immunoprecipitation of cell extract with the antiserum against the mouse SR G3 also brought down a 195-kD protein that could be recognized by an antiserum raised against human SWI2 protein .
The results suggest that the SR G3 protein associates with a mouse SWI2Z .
The SR G3 protein is expressed about three times higher in thymocytes than in peripheral lymphocytes .
The expression of anti-sense RNA to SR G3 mRNA in a thymoma cell line , $ 49.1 , reduced the expression level of the SR G3 protein , and decreased the apoptotic cell death induced by glucocorticoids .
These results suggest that the SR G3 protein is involved in the glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in the thymoma cell line .
This implicates that the SR G3 may play an important reg- ulatory role during T cell development in thymus .
Progenitor T cells arise in the bone marrow and migrate to thymus , where they continue to develop .
During the T cell development , more than 95 % of developing immature thymocytes die by apoptosis as a consequence of negative selection or lack of positive selection ( 1 ) .
This apoptotic death targets mainly the cortical double-positive ( CD4*CD8* ) thymocytes .
In thymocytes , apoptosis can be triggered by several exogenous stimuli such as glucocorticoids ( 2-4 ) , removal of growth factors ( 5 , 6 ) , exposure to y- irradiation ( 7 ) , and antigen binding involving the CD3/ TCR ( 8-10 ) .
The effect of glucocorticoids ( GCs ) !
is selec-tive ; the immature CD4*CD8* thymocyte fraction is rapidly killed by GC treatment , whereas both the precursor population ( TCR-CD4~CD8~ ) and mature thymocytes ( CD4+* or CD8t* ) are relatively resistant ( 11 ) .

1827 ported that GC is produced within the thymus ( 12 ) , and that transgenic expression of anti-sense RNA to glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) significantly affects the thymocyte development ( 13 ) .
These results suggest that endogenous GC produced in thymus may participate as an important regulatory molecule of normal thymic development ( 14 , 15 ) .
GCs , when complexed with an activated receptor , can induce or inhibit the expression of specific genes , which may be related to the induction of apoptosis .
The transcriptional regulation of downstream genes by GCs requires not only GR itself but several additional transcription factors such as the SWI-SNF protein complex ( 16-20 ) .
For exam-ple , the rat GR , when expressed in yeast , requires SWI-SNF proteins for transcriptional activation of GR -responsive genes and the GR-SWI3 complexes were coimmunoprecipitated in yeast extract ( 19 , 20 ) .
In addition , antibodies against SW I3 interfere with the ability of rat GR to activate transcription in Drosophila melanogaster nuclear extracts ( 19 ) .
SWI3 is a subunit of the SWI-SNF complex that seems J. Exp .

The other subunits of the SWI-SNF complex so far identified include the SWII ( ADR 6 ) , SWI2 ( SNF2 ) , SNF5 , SNF6 , SNFI1 , and SWP73 .
The complex was initially identified in Sacharomycs cerevisiae ( 8. cerevisiae ) as a positive regulator of HO , a gene involved in mating type switching ( 24 , 25 ) , and SUC2 , a glucose-repressible gene that encodes the enzyme invertase ( 26 , 27 ) .
These SWI gene products were subsequently found to be required for the transcriptional activation of many other genes ( 28-31 ) .
Such activities of the SWI-SNF proteins are closely interconnected and they seem to function as components of a complex that associates with gene-specific activators ( 31-35 ) .
The functional significance of the SWI-SNF complex is reflected by the evolutionary conservation of these genes in higher eukaryotes .
Several higher eukaryotic homologues of SW I-SNF genes such as Drosophila homeotic gene activator bm , hbrmm ( also known as and BRG 1 ( also known as hSNF2 ( ) have been identified ( 36-39 ) .
In addition , a human protein homologue of SNFS5 ( 40 , 41 ) and mouse BAF6O0 ( 42 ) , which is homologous to SWP73 , have been identified .
Recently , distinct complexes containing the BRG 1 or hom that have an in vitro activity similar to yeast SWI-SNF have been purified from human cell lines ( 42 , 43 ) .
From these complexes , the human BAF155 and BAF170 proteins that are homologous to SW1I3 protein were identified ( 42 ) .
In this paper , we describe a newly isolated mouse gene , the SWI3-related gene ( SRG3 ) , expressed in thymus and encoding a protein that shows significant amino acid sequence homology to both yeast SW1I3 and human BAF155 proteins .
The SR G3 protein coimmunoprecipitates with a mouse SWIT2-like protein , suggesting their forming a protein complex in vivo .
In addition , our data show that the SR G3 is expressed at much higher level in thymus than in peripheral lymphocytes .
Because the GC is proposed to be a regulatory molecule in thymocyte development in thymus , and the SWT-related proteins have an important role in GC-mediated gene regulation , the high level expression of SWI3-related gene ( SRG3 ) in thymocytes may imply that SR G3 has a crucial role in thymocyte development as a mediator of GC-induced transcriptional activation and apoptotic cell death of thymocytes .
As a first step of testing this hypothesis , we analyzed the effect of downregulation of SRG3 expression in a GC-sensitive thymoma cell line on induced apoptosis .

- The comparison of amino acid sequences of the SR G3 with SWI3 and its human homologues , BAF155 and BAF170 .
The YFK7 , another yeast homologue of SW1I3 , is also presented .
The regions showing highest homology are shown by rectangles with distinctive fillings ( A ) .
The SR G3 and human homologues of SW1I3 protein contain the proline- and glutamine-rich domains that lack in the yeast SW1I3 .
Amino acid comparisons of the three regions ( Region I , II , and III ) are shown in B and C. The three homologous regions of SR G3 and SW1I3 protein displayed 33-47 % identity and 61-64 % similarity .
The amino acids that are identical to consensus sequences are indicated as dots ( C ) .
The NH , -terminal part of the SR G3 is highly acidic ; 23 % of 231 amino acids ( 211-441 ) are either aspartate or glutamate .
The COOH-terminal part has the leucine-zipper motif ( 53 ) , and the proline- and glutamine-rich region .
The proline and glutamine residues make up 44 % over 150 amino acids ( 952-1,100 ) .
In addition , the myb-like tryptophan repeat domain or SANT ( SW13 , ADAZ , N-CoR , and TFIIIB B `` `` ) domain ( 54 ) , which may be involved in interaction with DN A , was also found in the middle part of this protein ( Fig .
2 A ) .
Therefore , this gene product seems to act as a transcriptional activator probably by interacting with other proteins or by interacting with DN A. R ecently , the human homologues of yeast SW13 , BAF155 , and BAF170 , were identified and designated as BR G1 associated factors ( 42 ) .
We found that the SR G3 protein has very high amino acid sequence homology to BAF155 protein ( Fig .
2 ) .
They show 91 % identity in their complete amino acid sequences , with the major deviations occurring at the NH , termini .
Therefore , we conclude that the SR G3 protein is the murine counterpart of human BAF155 protein .
The SRG3 protein also matches well with the BAF170 , another human SWI3 homologue ; they are 60 % identical and 70 % similar at the amino acid level .
In addition , the SR G3 protein has a considerable homology with the yeast YFK7 protein , which is also known as SW13b ( 42 ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
The major similarity between the SW1I3 and its mammalian homologues at the amino acid level is found over three regions ( Fig .
2 B ) .
The three regions of the SWI3 and SR G3 proteins shows 33-47 % identity and 61-64 % simi- 1830 larity .
The NH , -terminal part of the SWI3 is also extremely acidic , yet similarity with the SR G3 is still very low .
The leucine-zipper motifs in the region III of these proteins are different from SW1I3 in that the third leucine of the SW1I3 protein is replaced by phenylalanine in SR G3 and BAF155 ( Fig .
2 C ) .
In the COOH-terminal region , SWI3 lacks proline- and glutamine-rich regions found in its mammalian homologues .
The data suggests that these proteins have similar protein structures and probably similar biochemical functions However , there is divergence in structure and , probably , also in function between these proteins .
Identification of the SRG3 Gene Produd .
To identify the protein product of the SRG3 gene , polyclonal antibody was produced against the SR G3-GST fusion protein .
The COOH-terminal part of the SRG3 gene was inserted in-frame into the pGEX4T-2 plasmid containing the gluta-thione- S-transferase ( GST ) gene .
The overexpressed GST 3C fusion protein with ~85 kD of molecular mass was used to immunize rabbits through subcutaneous injection .
After primary and booster injections , polyclonal antiserum against GST-3C fusion protein was obtained .
The antiserum was confirmed to recognize specifically the fusion protein ( data not shown ) .
To identify the SRG3 gene product , immunoblot analysis was performed with crude extracts prepared from thymus and lymph node .
As shown in Fig .
3 A , two bands of ~155 and 170 kD were observed ; the 155-kD protein is likely to be SR G3 .
This is supported by the observations that the protein matches well to the size of SRG 3 R equired for Glucocorticoid-induced Apoptosis p ( £5 A 006 B xét ' & & « £ p © .

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation of the SRG3 protein .
The overexpressed COOH-terminal part of SRG3 gene in Esche-nchia coli system was used to immunize rabbits to produce the polyclonal antiserum .
When thymus and lymph node extract were blotted with the SRG3 antiserum , bands at 155 and 170 kD were detected ( A ) .
When the extract was blotted with the hSWI2 antiserum , a band at 195 kD ( B , top ) was detected .
After immunoprecipitating the extract with the SR G3 antiserum , the precipitates were blotted with the SR G3 antiserum ( B , bottom ) or the hSW1T2 antiserum ( B , top ) , displaying the 155- and 195-kD bands , respectively .
Immunoprecipitation with preimmune serum and blotting with the SR G3 and hSW1T2 antiserum dose not show any band ( B ) .

the BAF155 in human ( 42 ) , that the antiserum immuno-precipitates the 155-kD protein ( Fig .
3 B ) , and that the intensity of the 155-kD protein band was specifically reduced when anti-sense RNA to the SR G3 is expressed in a cell line ( see Fig .
6 A ) .
The antiserum also recognized a 170-kD protein that seemed to be similar to the SR G3 protein in its structure .
Considering the results of human SWI3 homologues ( 42 ) , it is likely that the 170-kD protein may be the mouse counterpart of the human BAF170 protein .
The SR G3 and BAF170 are quite similar to each other over regions I ( 86 % ) , II ( 93 % ) , and III ( 89 % ) ( see Fig .
2 B ) , and anti- SR G3 antiserum seems to recognize a murine BAF170-like protein as well as SR G3 .
Interestingly , SR G3 is expressed at a three times higher level in thymus than in lymph nodes ; however , the 170-kD protein is expressed at similar levels in both tissues .
We tested whether the SR G3 protein is associated with other proteins such as a mouse SWIT2-like protein .
After immunoprecipitation of cell extract with the antiserum followed by blotting with the same antiserum , the specific band of 155 kD was observed ( Fig .
3 B , bottom ) .
We have also employed the hSWT2 antiserum that recognized a protein with molecular mass ~195 kD in thymocyte extract ( Fig .
3 B ) .
The 195-kD protein is similar to the size of hSWI2 ( 43 ) and seems to be a mouse homologue of hSWI2 .
When thymocyte extract was immunoprecipitated with the SR G3 antiserum and blotted with the hSWI2 antiserum , a specific band corresponding to the mouse SWI2-like protein was detected ( Fig .
3 B , top ) .
These results suggest that the SR G3 associates with a SWI2-like protein and possibly with other SWI-SNF proteins .
The SRG3 Protein Does Not Complement the Yeast swi3~ Mutant .
_ To test the possibility that the mouse SRG3 gene 1831 Jeon et al .
product complements the yeast swi3~ mutation , the S. « & e visiae host strain CY165 ( swi3~ ) containing the HO-lakZ gene ( 25 ) was transformed with the pR S316GU vector containing the SRG3 full coding sequence or SWI3-SRG3 hybrid gene at the downstream of the URA3 promoter .
Cells transformed with the SWI3-SRG3 hybrid gene were confirmed to express the hybrid protein by Western blotting using the SR G3 and SWI3 antisera ( data not shown ) .
The growth rate of swi3~ mutant was very slow ( 33 ) and was not significantly changed after the transformation with either the SRG3 or the SWI3-SRG3 hybrid .
In addition , expression of laZ gene , controlled by the HO promoter which requires the SWI-SNF protein complex for transcriptional activation , was not induced after the transformations of SRG3 or SWI3-SRG3 hybrid .
The level of expression of laZ gene in the SRG3 transformant was only ~22 % of the mutant cells transformed with the yeast SW I3 ( a positive control ) , whereas the LacZ expression level in mutant cells transformed only with a vector plasmid was ~20 % of the SW I3 transformed cells .
The result was consistent in three independent experiments .
The SRG3 mRNA Is Expressed Highly in Thymocytes , Brain , and Testis .
Northern blot analysis of SRG3 gene expression showed that the transcripts of this gene were 3.5 and 5 kb in size ( Fig .
4 A ) .
It seems that the 5.0-kb mRNA encodes the SRG3 protein because the 3.5-kb mR NA is not long enough to include the 3,300-base open reading frame , 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions , and poly ( A ) tail .
At this point , it is not clear what the 3.5-kb mRNA species encodes for .
However , when a 1.5-kb PstI fragment from the 3'-end of the SRG3 gene was used as a probe , only the 5-kb transcript was detected ( data not shown ) , suggest A B Io 2 O3 4050 6 1o2 % 3 .

- Size fractionation of the SR G3 and SWI-SNF protein com plexes .
After total thymocytes extract was separated on glycerol density gradient sedimentation , the gradients were fractionated and immunoblotted with the SR G3 and hSWI2 antisera .
The SR G3 protein was fractionated as separated complexes ( 300 kD ) which are different from SWI2 complexes ( 2 MD ) .
The blue-dextran ( 2 MD ) , thyroglobulin ( 669 kD ) , B-amylase ( 200 kD ) , and alcohol-dehydronase ( 150 kD ) were used as standard molecular mass size markers .
ing the possibility that these two transcripts are different at their 3 ' termini .
The SRG3 gene is expressed at higher levels in thymus , brain , and testis than in other tissues ( Fig .
4 A ) .
Northern blot analysis with RN As isolated from separated splenic T and B cell populations showed that the two populations express similar level of SRG3 .
The separated population was highly pure , as judged by the Northern blot using TCF-1 gene , a T cell-specific gene ( 55 , 56 ) , as a probe ( Fig .
4 B ) and by FACS® analysis ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , however , the level expressed in each peripheral lymphocyte population was only about 20 % of that expressed in thymocytes ( Fig .
4 B ) , as it was similarly shown by Western blot analysis ( see Fig .
3 A ) .
The Fundion of the SRG3 Protein in Thymocytes .
As shown in Fig .
3 A and Fig .
4 , the level of SR G3 expression in thymus was much higher than the level in peripheral lymphocytes .
Therefore , even though these proteins may form the SWI-SNF complex together with other proteins in mouse cells , it is also possible that the SR G3 protein exists independently of the SWI-SNF complex , especially in thymus .
It has also been suggested that the SW I-SNF complexes are present as multiple forms in different tissues and cell lines ( 42 ) .
To see whether SR G3 protein exists mostly as a SWI-SNF complex , we fractionated the thymus extract according to the size of molecules by a glycerol density gradient .
Each fraction was run on a gel and immunoblotted with the anti-SR G3 and the anti-hSWI2 antiserum .
As shown in Fig .
5 , the mouse SWI2 protein was mostly fractionated as a 2 MD complex as previously reported ( 42 ) .
However , the SR G3 protein was detected in a broad range of molecular masses , from 150 kD to 2 MD .
Interestingly , a major portion of the protein was fractionated as 300 kD .
The 170-kD protein was also fractionated similarly to SR G3 protein .
These results suggest that a major portion of the 1832 SRG3 protein ( and the 170 kD protein ) exists independently of the SWI-SNF complex and that they may play a special role in developing thymocytes .
This was similarly reported for BAF155 and BAF170 proteins ; some BAF155 and BAF170 are not associated with human SWI-SNF complexes ( 42 ) .
One of the roles played by the SR G3 or the SWI-SNF complex in thymus may be mediating GR -induced transcriptional activation .
One consequence of it is the induction of GC-mediated apoptosis in immature thymocytes .
Thus , we have tested whether the SR G3 is required for the GC -mediated apoptosis in GC sensitive thymocyte cell line .
A plasmid expressing the SRG3 gene in anti-sense orientation under the control of CMV promoter ( pRASRG3 ) was constructed .
The pRASRG3 construct was introduced into a GC -sensitive thymoma cell line , $ 49.1 , through DNA transfection , and two clones , clone A and B , displaying reduced expression of SR G3 were selected .
As shown in Fig .
6 A , clone A and B express ~50 and 30 % SR G3 protein of the vector transfectants , respectively .
The DN A fragmentation induced by GC treatment was greatly reduced in these clones and this effect was more dramatic in clone B , which expressed lower level of SR G3 protein than clone A ( Fig .
6 B ) .
The reduction in apoptotic cell death of the pRcASR G3 transfectants was also confirmed by FACS® analysis of the DNA contents of the cells .
After GC treatment , about 46 % of the vector transfectants were subdiploid and apoptotic ( Fig .
6 C , 0 ; however , only about 4 % of the treated clone B transfectants were apoptotic ( Fig .
6 C , d ) .
These results suggest that the SR G3 protein is involved in the GC-induced apoptosis of the thymoma cell line .
Discussion The subunit proteins of the SWI-SNF complex were initially identified in S. « revisiae as transcriptional activators of a set of genes .
The SWI-SNF proteins seem to facilitate transcription by antagonizing the repressive actions of chromatin ( 21-23 ) .
The subunit proteins seem to function as components of a complex that associate with gene-specific activators .
Mutations in any of the subunit genes resulted in very similar phenotypes and the phenotype of multiple defective swi~ or snf ~- mutants was identical to that of a single swi~ or snf ~ mutant ( 33 ) .
Besides , SWI-SNF proteins functioned interdependently in transcriptional activation ( 32 ) .
In addition , the SWI-SNF proteins were copurified and coimmunoprecipitated ( 31 , 34 ) and were shown to be components of a large multisubunit complex ( 34 , 35 ) .
Recently , human SWI-SNF complexes were shown to be present in multiple forms made up of 9-12 proteins and several of them were purified using the BR G1 antiserum ( 42 , 43 ) .
There seems to exist several different forms of SWI-SNF complexes in a single cell and in different differentiated cell types ( 42 ) .
Based on this , it has been suggested that these complexes are involved in tissue-specific and developmental process-specific chromatin remodeling activity needed for the differentiation of a cell ( 42 ) .

also identified and the two proteins seem to exist as core components in the same protein complex ( 42 ) .
SR G3 identified in the present study is homologous to human BAF155 .
The overall sequences are 94 % similar to each other and the protein products are quite similar in size .
The antiserum produced against SR G3 recognized an additional 170-kD protein , which seems to correspond to human BAF170 , implying that there also exists two SW13 homologues in mouse .
In spite of this similarity , the expression patterns of BAF155 and SR G3 seem to be somewhat different .
BAF155 is selectively expressed in muscle and heart but expressed at relatively low levels in liver and brain ( 42 ) ; however , SR G3 is expressed at much higher level in brain than in liver ( Fig .
4 A ) .
The selective expression patterns of BAF155 and BAF170 in different tissues were quite similar to each other .
However , mouse SR G3 is expressed at higher level in thymus than in peripheral lym-phoid tissues ( Fig .
3 ) ; on the other hand , the 170-kD protein is expressed at similar levels in these tissues .
Interestingly , some SR G3 proteins and the 170 kD proteins seem to exist independently of the SWI-SNF complex ( Fig .
5 ) .
It is not yet conclusive whether some SR G3 and 170-kD proteins exist as heterodimers or homodimers .
These results suggest that even though the human and mouse homologues of yeast SWI3 are structurally and functionally similar , they may play distinct roles in each species and in different tissues .
In yeast , the rat GR can activate transcription from a promoter bearing the GR -responsive element in the pres ence of glucocorticoid ( GC ) ( 57 , 58 ) .
It has been reported that transcriptional activation by GR , which regulates the 1833 Jeon et al .
expression of a network of genes in a tissue-specific man-ner , is dependent on SWII , SWI2 , SW1I3 , SWP73 gene functions in yeast ( 19 , 59 ) .
Furthermore , SWI3 was coimmunoprecipitated with GR in yeast extracts ( 19 ) , suggesting that the two proteins interact directly upon activation of GR .
Our study showed that SR G3 was highly expressed in developing thymocytes compared with mature peripheral T and B lymphocytes ( Fig .
3 ) .
When the level of SR G3 protein was reduced to ~50-30 % of normal level of thymoma cells by expressing anti-sense RNA to the gene , apoptosis induced by GC on these cells was significantly reduced ( Fig .
6 ) .
These results indicate that SR G3 is required for GC-induced apoptosis in the thymoma cells and suggests that SR G3 is an important factor for GC-mediated regulation of thymocyte development .
It has been hypothesized that GC might affect thymocyte development in a number of ways .
Thymocytes respond to GC by apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo ( 2 , 60 ) .
In vivo , the immature CD4*CD8* thymocyte population is rapidly killed in the presence of GC , whereas both the CD4-CD8~ precursor population expressing no TCR-and mature thymocytes ( CD4* or CD8 ) cells expressing high levels of TCR are relatively resistant .
U sing anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies as a model for negative selection , it has been found that pretreatment of mice with a GR antag-onist , R U486 , protects immature CD4*CD8* thymocytes from apoptosis ( 61 ) .
Furthermore , it has been reported that radioresistent thymic epithelial cells constitutively produce GC ( 12 ) .
Thus , GC and GR may function as important regulators in normal thymic differentiation ( 14 , 15 ) .
At this point , it is not clear whether GC-induced apoptosis of thy moma cells requires SR G3 as a component of the SWI-SNF complex or as a separate entity .
In yeast , transcriptional activation by GR is blocked by disrupting any one of SWII , SWI2 , and SWI3 genes , suggesting the possibility that the SWI-SNF complex is required for the GC sensitivity of thymocytes .
However , it is noteworthy that SR G3 protein is expressed at a much higher level in thymocytes than in peripheral T lymphocytes and that the major part of SR G3 protein may exist independently of the SWI-SNF complex in thymus .
Furthermore , even though the antisense RNA expression reduced the level of SR G3 protein in the transfected cells , there still remained ~50 % ( clone A ) or 30 % ( clone B ) of normal level of SR G3 protein ( Fig .
6 ) .
Even in the case of the clone B transfectant , this is at least the similar level of protein found in peripheral T lymphocytes ( Fig .
3 ) .
Therefore , it is likely that there still may be enough SR G3 protein left to form SWI-SNF complexes in the transfectants These results suggest a possibility that SRG3 protein may function independently of the SWI-SNF complex in GC-mediated apoptosis .
No matter how SRG3 functions in GC-mediated apoptosis in thymoma cells , either as a component of SWI-SNF complex or as an independent factor of the complex , our present results show that SRG3 protein is required for the process and possibly plays an important regulatory role during thymocyte development .
