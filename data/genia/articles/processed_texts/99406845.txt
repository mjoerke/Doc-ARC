In our study , we determined the induction of apoptosis by GC in human monocytes .
Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by density centrifugation methods with a purity of > 90 % and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium .
Monocyte apoptosis was determined by four independent methods , including annexin-V staining , TUNEL , DNA-laddering , and typical morphology by means of transmission electron microscopy .
TNF-a and IL-1B were measured by ELISA .
GC receptor was blocked with mifepristone .
Caspase 3 was inhibited with caspase-3 inhibitor ( DEVD-CHO ) .
Stimulation with different GC at therapeutic concentrations resulted in monocyte apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner .
Necrosis was excluded by propidium iodide staining .
Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B and TNF-a were down-regulated by GC treatment .
Continuous treatment of monocytes with IL-1 , but not with TNF-a , could almost completely prevent GC-induced cell death .
The addition of mifepristone or caspase-3 inhibitor could partially abrogate GC-induced apoptosis as well as GC-induced inhibition of IL-1 .
This is the first study to demonstrate induction of apoptosis by GC in human monocytes .
GC-induced monocyte apoptosis may be partially mediated through effects on IL-1 production .
It is conceivable that GC exert their anti-inflammatory capacity in various diseases , at least in part , by the induction of apoptosis in monocytes .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 163 : 3484-3490. onocytes and macrophages belong to the main effector cells of the immune system , because they play a cen- tral role in the initiation , development , and outcome of the immune response ( 1 , 2 ) .
They are known to secrete a variety of proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-a , IL-1 B , IL-6 , IL-8 , pro-teases , or free oxygen radicals ( 3 ) .
In addition , they also produce anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 ( 4 , 5 ) , IL-1Ra ( 6 , 7 ) , or soluble TNF receptors ( 8 , 9 ) .
Peripheral monocytes as well as differentiated tissue macrophages are known to play a key role in the inflammatory process of various immunomediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease ( 10 , 11 ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( 12 ) , or sepsis ( 13 ) .
Glucocorticoids ( GC ) ° are potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents that act on many cells including monocytes ( 14 ) .
They are potent down-regulators of monocyte-secreted proinflammatory mediators including TNF-a ( 15 , 16 ) , IL-1B ( 17 ) , or IL-6 ( 18 ) , which mediate inflammatory activity in various diseases ( 19-21 ) .
However , the exact cellular mechanisms by which GC exert their anti-inflammatory capacity in monocytes are only incompletely understood .

Copyright © 1999 by The American Association of Immunologists Apoptosis is a physiological self-destruction mechanism that is regulated by an endogenous program and signals from other cells .
It is characterized by typical morphological features and leads to the removal of the dying cell by macrophages in a way that prevents the onset of inflammatory reactions ( 22 , 23 ) .
Monocytes have been shown to undergo rapid apoptosis in culture unless stimulated with LPS or with proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a or IL-1 , which enhance monocyte survival by omitting the initiation of apoptosis ( 24 , 25 ) .
Recent studies dealing with the role of anti-inflammatory cytokines and their suppressive effects on monocytes demonstrated that IL-4 as well as IL-10 is able to induce apoptosis in monocytes ( 26 , 27 ) .
Therefore , it was postulated that the regulatory role of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the development of inflammatory reactions also involves the regulation of monocyte apoptosis .
In the present study , we investigated whether GC might evoke apoptosis in human monocytes .
Using four different methods for the determination of apoptosis , we could clearly demonstrate that GC at therapeutic concentrations are strong inducers of apoptosis in human monocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner .
Our data suggest that , at least in part , the well-known anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of GC on monocytes and macrophages are mediated by the induction of apoptosis .

We used a modification of the recently described hypotonic density gradient centrifugation method with Ficoll and Percoll ( 32 ) .
Briefly , mononuclear cells were collected from the interphase after Ficoll separation and washed twice in PBS .
Subsequently , cells were separated into lymphocytes and monocytes on a hypotonic Percoll density gradient ( 1.129 g/ml ) .
From the two interphases , the upper interphase containing the monocytes was collected and washed three times with PBS .
The monocyte suspension was adjusted to 10° monocytes/ml and plated on 24-well plates ( Greiner , Solin-gen , Germany ) .
Monocytes were further enriched by a 90-min adherence to culture plates and washed two times with PBS .
Enriched monocytes were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 % ( v/v ) heat-inac-tivated , pooled AB sera ( complete culture medium ) for 24-96 h in the presence or absence of dexamethasone ( 10~° to 10~ `` M ) , prednisolone ( 4 X 10~ `` to 4 X 10~ > M ) , and hydrocortisone ( 3 X 10~° to 3 X 10~ M ) .
All culture reagents used had endotoxin levels of < 0.01 ng/ml LPS .
The viability of the monocytes was > 95 % as determined by trypan blue ex-clusion ; purity was > 90 % as assessed by flow cytometric analysis ( Fig .
1A ) and nonspecific esterase staining .
Detection of annexin-V staining and CD14 expression on human monocytes Monocytes , prepared and treated as described above , were double-labeled with PE-conjugated Leu M3 mAb ( anti-CD14 ) and annexin-V FITC in PBS ( with 100 mg/l CaCl , and 100 mg/l MgC1 , ) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark .
PE- and FITC-conjugated murine IgG mAbs of unrelated specificities were always used as controls .
After staining , the cells were washed twice with PBS and measured by flow cytometry .
Determination of apoptosis by DNA electrophoresis DNA extraction and electrophoresis were performed as described previously ( 33 ) .
In brief , 1 X 10 ' monocytes were first lysed by a hypotonic lysing buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 0.2 % Triton X-100 , pH 7.4 ) .
After centrifugation ( 14,000 X g , 30 min ) supernatants containing cleaved chromatin were treated with RNase ( 50 mg/m ! )
and proteinase K ( 100 mg/ml ) ; DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol .
After precipitation with conc .
ethanol ( 99.6 % ) at -20°C and drying and heating of samples , equal amounts of DNA were loaded on a 1.8 % agarose gel and separated by electrophoresis for 2 h at 80 V. The lower detection limit for visualization of oligonucleosomal bands was 1.0 ug of DNA .
TUNEL procedure DNA strand breaks were identified by labeling free 3'-OH termini with modified nucleotides in an enzymatic reaction .
TdT catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotides to free 3'-OH DNA ends in a template-independent manner .
First , monocytes were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min .
Subsequently , the cytoplasma membrane was per-meabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice .
In the next step , DNA was labeled with FITC-conjugated NTP in the presence of TdT for 1 h at 37°C .
After labeling , cells were washed twice with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy .
Cells labeled in absence of TdT were always used as negative controls , whereas cells pre-treated with DNase after permeabilization were used as positive controls .
Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) Typical morphological alterations indicative of apoptosis were evaluated by TEM .
Cells were washed off the culture plates , centrifuged , fixed in 1 % glutaraldehyde/0.1 M sodium cacodylate-HCl ( pH 7.4 ) , and postfixed in 1 % OsO , /0.15 M sodium cacodylate-HC ] ( pH 7.4 ) .
Samples were dehydrated in ascending ethanol series and embedded in epoxy resin ( Epon 812 ) .
Ultrathin sections were mounted on 150 mesh Formvar-coated copper grids and poststained with aqueous saturated uranyl acetate and 2 % lead citrate before being examined on a Philips CM 10 electron microscope ( Philips Electronics , Mahway , NJ ) at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV by one of the authors ( M.S . )
.
Evaluation of cell necrosis The viability of monocytes treated with GC was determined by trypan blue exclusion or by flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide ( PT ) uptake from nonpermeabilized cells using standard protocols ( 24 , 34 ) .

Results Apoptosis in human monocytes after stimulation with GC Treatment with GC induced apoptosis in human monocytes .
We were able to demonstrate monocyte apoptosis with four independent methods .
By measuring annexin-V/CD14 binding on cell surfaces and TUNEL , we were able to identify the early stages of apoptosis .
Agarose gel electrophoresis and TEM were performed to demonstrate the late stages of apoptosis .
Using FACS analysis , we determined a significant increase of annexin-V-positive cells from 14 % up to 71 % after incubation with dexamethasone at different concentrations and a decrease of CD14 * cells from 52 % to 12 % ( Fig .
1B ) .
Using the TUNEL method , we were able to demonstrate GC-induced apoptosis in monocytes by fluorescence staining as well as by FACS analysis ( Fig .
2 ) .
Although the control population showed only few TUNEL-positive cells with a homo-genous fluorescent nucleus , almost all cells of the dexamethasone-treated population were TUNEL-positive .
Stimulation with a high dexamethasone concentration ( 10 * M dexamethasone ) induced nucleus fragmentation ( Fig .
2 ) .
Apoptosis was quantified in parallel by fluorescence microscopy and FACS analysis .
We were able to demonstrate an enhancement of TUNEL-positive cells after stimulation with dexamethasone from 30 % up to 95 % ( Fig .
2 ) .
In addition , we were able to demonstrate apoptosis by characteristic DNA-laddering using agarose gel electrophoresis ( Fig .
3 ) .
In the time kinetics , specific DNA-laddering could be shown after dexamethasone ( 10~° M ) incubation lasting for > 72 h. Apoptosis-spe-cific laddering was dose-dependent at dexamethasone concentrations of 107° M to 10~* M after an incubation period of 72 h ( Fig .
3B ) .
Using low concentrations of dexamethasone , only intact genomic DNA could be identified .
Morphological alterations of GC-treated monocytes were determined by TEM .

We also observed heterochromatic DNA in the nucleus and intact cytoplasmatic organelles in control monocytes .
In Fig .
4 , D-F , the relation between nucleus and cytoplasm is shifted to the nucleus .
In GC-treated monocytes , we show shrunk cells , a condensed nucleus , and increased vacuolization of the cytoplasm .
These signs are typical of apoptotic cells .
Induction of apoptosis by GC in monocytes is dose- and time-dependent GC induced apoptosis in human monocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner .
We were able to demonstrate a significant increase of annexin-V-positive cells at rising dexamethasone concentrations ( 10 ~® M to 10~ > M ) from 30.3 % ( p < 0.05 ) to 53.7 % ( p < 0.01 ) ( medium : 15.6 % ) ( Fig .
5A ) .
After an incubation period of 48 h , we noticed a significant increase ( and a strongly significant increase after 72 h ) of annexin-V-positive monocytes .
Annexin-V-positive monocytes in the medium were 21.7 % after a 72-h incubation , whereas an increase was found in the dexamethasone-treated group of up to 50.1 % at 10~° M ( p < 0.01 ) , 65.05 % at 10~° M ( p < 0.01 ) , and 69.0 % at a concentration of 10~* M dexamethasone ( p < 0.01 ) ( Fig .

Monocytes were treated with 10~° M dexamethasone ( A ) .
The DNA-specific laddering could be demonstrated after an incubation period of > 72 h. There was also a dose dependency ( B ) with apoptosis-specific laddering at dexamethasone concentrations from 10~° M to 10~* M after 72 h of cell culture time .

Electron microscopic features of monocytes treated with GC .
Monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium for 72 h without GC ( A-C ) or with 10~° M dexamethasone ( D-F ) before being prepared for TEM .
In the control population , nearly all monocytes remained intact concerning morphology of the nucleus and cytoplasm .
After dexamethasone treatment , monocytes exhibited typical signs of apoptosis , with dense nuclear condensation , degeneration of organelles , cytoplasmic hypervacuol-ization , and loss of plasma membrane microvilli .

Open histograms representing monocytes with permeable cytoplasma membrane served as a positive control .
There was no significant difference between PI-negative monocytes in any experiment .
the following annexin-V-positive monocytes : medium : 15.6 % ; concentration B : 10~° M dexamethasone at 29.3 % , 4 X 10~° M prednisolone at 25.8 % , and 3 X 10~° M hydrocortisone at 36.0 % ( p < 0.05 ) ( compared with medium control ) .
After stimulation with higher concentrations of GC ( concentration C : 10 ~* M dexamethasone , 4 X 10~* M prednisolone , and 3 X 10~° M hydro-cortisone ) , there was also a strongly significant induction of apoptosis ( p < 0.01 ) .
Exclusion of necrosis by PI staining The exclusion of necrotic cell death is essential for the demonstration of programmed cell death ( PCD ) .
For this purpose , monocytes were incubated with different dexamethasone concentrations for 48 h in cell culture and stained with PI .
Untreated monocytes with permeable cytoplasma membrane served as positive controls .
As shown in Fig .
10 treatment with various doses of dexamethasone failed to increase PI staining compared with controls ( filled histo-gram ) .
After a 48-h incubation , we found 90 % PI-negative monocytes in the control medium , whereas the ratio was 91 % in monocytes treated with 10~° M dexamethasone , 88 % in monocytes treated with 10~° M dexamethasone , and 89 % in cells stimulated with 10 ~* M dexamethasone .
Decreased monocyte production of TNF-a and IL-1 after treatment with GC To examine the influence of GC on cytokine production , we performed ELISAs of TNF-a and IL-1 in cell culture supernatants .
Monocytes were incubated with different concentrations of dexamethasone as well as with mifepristone and caspase-3 inhibitor for 48 h. We noticed a down-regulation of cytokine production depending upon GC concentrations ( Table I ) .

( 107° M ) partially diminished the effects of GC on IL-1 production by monocytes compared with cells treated with dexamethasone ( 10~° M ) alone ( 299.7 pg/ml IL-1B vs 172.1 pg/ml IL-1 ) .
Caspase-3 inhibition ( caspase-3 inhibitor , 10~° M ) also partially abrogated the effect of GC on IL-1 ( 3 secretion in monocytes compared with dexamethasone ( 107° M ) -treated cells alone ( 274.2 pg/ml vs 172.1 pg/ml IL-1B ) .
Discussion This is the first study demonstrating that GC at therapeutic concentrations ( dexamethasone from 10~® M to 10~° M ) can evoke apoptosis in human monocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner .
Monocytes and macrophages belong to one of the main immune cell populations that are involved in a wide range of inflammatory disorders .
The immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory actions of GC are mediated through actions on different cell types , including monocytes and macrophages .
These effects are brought about by the suppression of secretion of various cytokines , including TNF-a and IL-1 $ , which contribute to the immune and inflammatory activities of monocytes and macrophages .
Induction of apoptosis in monocytes as a potential immu-nomodulating mechanism of GC has not yet been described .
In the present study , the apoptotic effects of GC on highly purified populations of human monocytes have been determined by four different methods .
As marker for early apoptosis , we performed binding studies with annexin-V , which was bound on apoptotic monocytes .
A significant increase of annexin-V-positive monocytes after stimulation with dexamethasone was observed .
TUNEL also became strongly positive in monocytes treated with GC in a dose-dependent manner .
Later on by means of TEM , GC-treated monocytes revealed typical morphological signs of apoptosis , such as cytoplasmic hypervacuolization and chromatin condensation of the nucleus .
Apoptosis was further confirmed by characteristic ladder patterns in DNA electrophoresis .
Monocyte necrosis could be excluded using PI staining .
In our study , we used GC concentrations from 10~° M to 10~° M , which are reached in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases .
To exclude the different properties of various types of GC , dexamethasone , prednisolone , and hydrocortisone were examined .
When we compared the relative concentrations of these GC depending upon their biological strength , we could not find any significant difference concerning their apoptogenic capacity .
We could further demonstrate a diminished induction of apoptosis after cotreatment with the GC receptor antagonist mifepristone .
Therefore , we conclude that there is a direct receptor-medi-ated effect of GC on monocyte apoptosis .
GC-induced monocyte apoptosis could also be partially blocked by treatment with caspase-3 inhibitor .
Caspase-3 is a main enzyme in the apoptosis-signaling pathway that deactivates poly ( ADP-ribose ) -polymerase and therefore seems to be involved in GC-induced monocyte apoptosis .
Until now , the exact mechanisms of the immunosuppressive activity of GC were unknown .
It is likely that multiple modes of action exist ( 35 ) .
High-affinity GC receptors have been identified in earlier studies ( 36 ) .
Monocytopenia ( 37 ) as well as diminished chemotaxis and decreased antimicrobial activity have been described elsewhere .
In addition , it could be demonstrated that monocyte-derived proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 , IL-6 , and TNF-a are suppressed by GC ( 9 , 17 , 38 ) .
Down-regulation of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-1B by GC has also been determined in our monocyte culture system .
Recently , it has also been suggested that proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 B and TNF-a exert anti-apoptotic effects as they rescue monocytes from undergoing apoptosis and prolong survival of monocytes ( 24 , 25 ) .
Down-regulation of anti-apoptotic mediators such as TNF-a or IL-1B as determined in our study may promote apoptosis in monocytes .
We were able to demonstrate that continuous treatment with IL-1 B , in contrast to TNF-a , almost completely prevents GC-induced apoptosis .
Therefore , IL-1B seems to have important an-tiapoptotic properties , and it is conceivable that the observed effects of GC-induced monocyte apoptosis are mediated through effects of GC inhibition of IL-1 production .
However , the partial reversal of GC-induced IL-1 3 inhibition of caspase-3 antagonism implies that apoptosis is required for full inhibition of IL-1 B .
This suggests a direct effect of apoptosis on IL-1B production rather than these effects being exclusively in the reverse direction .
In activated immune cells , the induction of apoptosis may be an additional important mechanism by which GC to exert their anti-inflammatory properties .
There are several reports demonstrating that immunosuppressive agents , including GC , induce apoptosis in T lymphocytes ( 39 , 40 ) , whereas no study deals with GC-induced apoptosis in monocytes .
The induction of PCD by immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory cytokines has recently been described by others .
IL-4 , a T cell-derived cytokine that acts on monocytes , as well as 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG 3490 IL-10 , have been shown to induce apoptosis in peripheral monocytes ( 26 , 27 , 33 ) .
PCD as evoked in monocytes by immunosuppressive agents such as steroids or anti-inflammatory cytokines may therefore be an important mechanism in the treatment of immunomediated diseases , in addition to the well known monocyte deactivating effects of these mediators .
Following steroid treatment , systemic monocytopenia may be a consequence of an increased rate of monocyte apoptosis .
The induction of apoptosis in monocytes by GC may have two contrasting effects .
During the state of inflammation , the induction of PCD in highly activated monocytes , which secrete a variety of mediators maintaining inflammation , may have therapeutic benefit .
The disadvantage of monocyte apoptosis , however , may be that potent immune cells belonging to the mononuclear phagocyte system will be eliminated .
Consequently , an increased risk of infectious diseases may develop in patients treated with GC .
All in all , our data suggest that induction of apoptosis in human monocytes appears to be an important way for GC to exert their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties .
The monocyte apoptosis induced by immunosuppressive agents such as GC may regulate cell number at the inflammatory site and also reduce release of toxic mediators into systemic circulation .
