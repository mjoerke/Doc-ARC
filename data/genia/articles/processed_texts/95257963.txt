5 Coupling of a Signal Response Domain in IxBa to Multiple Pathways for NF- « B Activation JEFFREY A. BROCKMAN , DAVID C. SCHERER , TIMOTHY A. McKINSEY , SARAH M. HALL , XIAOXIA QI , WHA YOUNG LEE , anp DEAN W. BALLARD* Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , Nashville , Tennessee Received 7 November 1994/Returned for modification 25 January 1995/Accepted 13 February 1995 The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-KB plays a central role in the induced expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and in many aspects of the genetic program mediating normal T-cell activation and growth .
The nuclear activity of NF-KB is tightly regulated from the cytoplasmic compartment by an inhibitory subunit called IxBa .
This cytoplasmic inhibitor is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in response to a diverse set of NF- agents , including T-cell mitogens , proinflammatory cytokines , and viral trans-activators such as the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 .
To explore these IBa-dependent mechanisms for NF-KB induction , we identified novel mutants of IxBa that uncouple its inhibitory and signal-transducing functions in human T lymphocytes .
Specifically , removal of the N-terminal 36 amino acids of IxBa failed to disrupt its ability to form latent complexes with NF-B in the cytoplasm .
However , this deletion mutation prevented the induced phosphorylation , degradative loss , and functional release of IxBa from NF-KB in Tax-expressing cells .
Alanine substitutions introduced at two serine residues positioned within this N-terminal regulatory region of IxBa also yielded constitutive repressors that escaped from Tax-induced turnover and that potently inhibited immune activation pathways for NF-KB induction , including those initiated from antigen and cytokine receptors .
In contrast , introduction of a phosphoserine mimetic at these sites rectified this functional defect , a finding consistent with a causal linkage between the phosphorylation status and proteolytic stability of this cytoplasmic inhibitor .
Together , these in vivo studies define a critical signal response domain in IxBa that coordinately controls the biologic activities of IxBa and NF-KB in response to viral and immune stimuli .
The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-kB participates in the activation and controlled proliferation of T lymphocytes during immune and inflammatory responses ( for a review , see references 31 , 32 , and 46 ) .
The prototypical form of NF-kB is a heterodimeric complex containing two DNA binding sub-units , termed p50 and RelA , both of which belong to the Rel family of transcription factors ( 5 , 16 , 28 , 43 , 54 , 60 , 67 ) .
When expressed in the nucleus , this inducible complex stimulates gene transcription via a potent transactivation domain in the C-terminal half of RelA ( 7 , 68 , 70 ) .
However , in resting T lymphocytes , the nuclear import of NF- « B is prevented because of high-affinity association of its RelA subunit with a labile cytoplasmic inhibitor called ( 3-5 , 11 , 27 ) .
This IxBa-dependent mechanism for the cytoplasmic retention of NF-kB is uncoupled by many extracellular signals , including T-cell receptor ligands , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF- « ) , and interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) ( for a review , see reference 32 ) .
During normal T-cell activation , nuclear translocation of NF- « B is preceded by the rapid phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa ( 9 , 10 , 19 , 35 , 80 , 81 ) .
However , the role , if any , that phosphorylation plays in regulating the degradation of IxBa remains unclear .
In contrast to its transient nuclear expression in normal T lymphocytes , NF-kB is constitutively activated in cells expressing the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) ( 6 , 47 , 69 ) .

2809 inducibility to a set of NF- « xB-responsive cellular genes that are normally transcribed at high levels in response to T-cell activation signals ( for reviews , see references 31 and 32 ) .
This set includes the transcription units encoding IL-2 and the alpha subunit of its high-affinity receptor ( IL-2Ra ) , which together play a key role in normal growth signal transduction ( 21 , 40 , 44 , 51 , 76 ) .
The Tax protein has also been shown to activate transcription from the 5 ' long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) , which contains two tandem NF-kB binding sites ( 15 , 55 ) .
Recent studies have shown that Tax-induced activation of NF-kB is temporally associated with the phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa ( 42 , 82 ) .
In addition , Schreck et al .
have demonstrated that the activation of NF-kB by Tax is partially inhibited by select antioxidants that block physiologic NF- « B induction in human T cells ( 71 , 72 ) .
Although these findings suggest a convergent mechanism for NF-kB induction involving the inactivation of IxBa , an explanation for how this cytoplasmic inhibitor integrates seemingly disparate viral and immune activation signals has remained unknown .
To address this question , we devised an expression system that permits functional incorporation of ectopic forms of IxBa into the endogenous NF-kB signaling pathway of human T lymphocytes .
Using this in vivo approach , we have identified a signal response ( SR ) domain in the N-terminal region of IxBa that is required not only for constitutive activation of NF- « B mediated by HTLV-1 Tax but also for transient activation of NF- « B via signal transduction pathways linked to T-cell antigen and cytokine receptors .
Mutations introduced at two serine residues within this regulatory domain produced constitutive repressors of NF-kB-directed transcrip-tion , despite the presence of agonists that normally induce the 2810 BROCKMAN ET AL .
degradation of IxBa and the nuclear translocation of NF- « B .
This dominant-negative phenotype was associated with the escape of IxBa from proteolytic breakdown , suggesting that the phosphorylation status of the SR domain may affect the induced entry of IxB into its degradative pathway .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids .
Complementary DNAs encoding full-length wild-type and mutant forms of HTLV-1 Tax ( 77 ) , human RelA ( 67 ) , and human IxBa ( 33 ) were cloned into the polylinker of the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV4 ( 2 ) immediately downstream of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmids contained either the full-length HTLV-1 LTR ( 78 ) , HIV-1 LTR ( 78 ) , c-fos promoter ( 29 ) , IL-2Ra promoter ( nucleotides -317 to +109 ) ( 49 ) , or HIV « B enhancer cassette linked to a heterologous TATA box ( 79 ) .
Deletion mutants of IxBa encoding amino acids 37 to 317 ( IxBaAN ) and 1 to 242 ( IxBaAC ) were constructed by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers ( 5'-GGGAAGCTTCTCGTCCGCGCCATGA AAGACGAGGAGTACGAG-3 ' and 5'-GGTCTAGATCATAACGTCAGAC GCTGGCCT-3 ' for IxBeAN ; CCAG-3 ' and 5 % -GGTCTAGATCAATCAGCCCCACACTTCAACAG-3 ' for IxBaAC ) and the wild-type IxBa ( IxBaWT ) cDNA ( 33 ) as a template .
Amplified products were digested with HindIII and Xbel , purified on 1 % agarose gels , and ligated into the pCMV4 polylinker .
Site-directed mutations were introduced into the full-length IxBa cDNA by using the phosphorothioate method and oligonucleotide primers that introduced diagnostic restriction sites ( 56 ) .
Epitope-tagged derivatives of select IxBa mutants were constructed by PCR-assisted amplification with 5 ' primers that fused sequences encoding the FLAG epitope ( 13 , 64 ) in frame with N-terminal coding sequences of IxBa ( 5'-CCCAAGCTTCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAAATGT TCCAGGCGGCCGAGCGC-3 ' for I « BaWT , IxBoAC , IxBaS32A , and IxBaS32E ; 5-CCCAAGCTTCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAAAT GAAAGACGAGGAGTACGAGC-3 ' for IxBaAN ) .
Amplified products were cloned into the HindIII and Xbel polylinker sites of pCMV4 .
Cell culture , transfections , and CAT assays .
Jurkat T lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , and antibiotics .
Approximately 10 `` cells suspended in RPMI ( 300 l ) were transfected by electroporation ( 250 V , 960 mF ) ( 25 ) with the indicated effector and reporter plasmids , using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser equipped with a capacitance extender .
Electroporated cells were placed on ice for 10 min , transferred to 5 ml of complete medium , and then expanded for 48 h. Where indi-cated , cultures were treated after 24 h of growth with either TNF- « ( 300 U/ml ; Genzyme ) or combinations of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ; 50 ng/m ! )
and ionomycin ( 1 aM ; Calbiochem ) for 20 h prior to harvest .
In some experi-ments , cell cultures were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( 62 ) ( kindly supplied by MyoGenics , Inc. ) before addition of the NF- « B agonist .
Whole-cell extracts were prepared from transfectants , normalized for protein concentration ( 18 ) , and assayed for CAT activity , using the diffusion-based liquid scintillation counting method described by Neumann et al .
( 59 ) .
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting .
Cytosolic extracts were prepared from transfected cells as described previously ( 73 ) except that the detergent lysis buffer was supplemented with an extensive cocktail of protease inhibitors ( 8 ) .
Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and equilibrated in ELB buffer ( 50 mM N-2-hydroxycthylpiperazinec-V'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ] , 250 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 0.1 % Nonidet-P40 ) .
Epitope-tagged IxBa was isolated from these cytosolic extracts by incubation with 20 wl of agarose beads conjugated to monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody ( IBI-Kodak ) .
Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ELB buffer , heat denatured in 4 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -10 % B-mercaptocthanol , fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel elec-trophoresis ( PAGE ) , and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene di-fluoride membrane ( Dupont ) .
Membranes were blocked ( 1 h at room temper-ature ) with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 % Tween 20 and 5 % powdered milk ( BLOTTO ) and then incubated with a rabbit antipeptide antiserum specific for either IxBa ( amino acids 1 to 28 and 229 to 317 ) or RelA ( amino acids 529 to 551 ) .
Immunoreactive polypeptides were detected by using donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in an enhanced chemi-luminescence system as specified by the manufacturer ( Amersham ) .
Gel retardation assays .
Nuclear fractions were prepared from Jurkat T-cell transfectants by high-salt extraction ( 73 ) in the presence of protease inhibitors ( 8 ) .
Gel mobility shift assays were performed by using a P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide duplex derived from xB enhancer sequences in the IL-2Ra promoter ( 5'-CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCCTT-3 ' ) ( 8 ) .
DNA binding reaction mixtures ( 20 pl ) contained 5 pg of Jurkat nuclear extract , 2 mg of double-stranded poly ( dI-dC ) , and 10 pg of bovine serum albumin buffered in 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) -5 % glycerol-1 mM EDTA-1 % Nonidet P-40-5 mM dithioth-reitol .
Approximately 10 fmol ( 200,000 epm ) of radiolabeled probe was used per reaction .
Resultant nucleoprotein complexes were resolved on native 5 % polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography as previously described ( 14 ) .

Identification of a Tax-responsive domain in IxBa « .
Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with HIV- « B-CAT ( 5 pg ) and equivalent doses ( 2.5 pg ) of the indicated pCMV4-based IxBa expression vectors , in the presence or absence of a Tax expression vector ( 5 pg ) .
After 48 h of culture , whole-cell extracts were prepared , normalized for total protein , and assayed for CAT activity .
Results from five independent transfections are reported as the mean fold induction ( + standard error of the mean ) of CAT activity in Tax-expressing versus Tax-deficient cells .
RESULTS IxBa is a cellular target of HTLV-1 Tax .
Recent primary structural analyses of human IxBa have indicated that this cytoplasmic inhibitor contains a central domain ( amino acids 73 to 242 ) composed of five ankyrin repeat motifs , a C-terminal PEST domain ( amino acids 243 to 317 ) characteristic of many short-lived proteins , and an N-terminal domain of unknown biological function ( 33 ) .
To determine whether IKxBa « is required for Tax-induced activation of NF-kB , we initially examined the ability of Tax to mediate « B-specific transcription in cells reconstituted with deletion mutants of IxBa that contained a fully intact ankyrin repeat domain .
For these studies , human Jurkat T lymphocytes were transfected with expression vectors encoding these truncated forms of IxBa , HTLV-1 Tax , and a CAT reporter plasmid under the transcriptional control of two NF- « B binding sites from the HIV enhancer ( HIV- « kB-CAT ) ( 55 , 79 ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , Tax induced the activation of the HIV-kB reporter gene at least 50-fold over basal levels in the absence of ectopic IxBa .
This activity persisted in the presence of either IxBaWT or a mutant of IxBa lacking the C-terminal PEST domain ( amino acids 243 to 317 ; IxBaAC ) .
In sharp contrast to IxBaWT , identical doses ( 2.5 ug ) of a deletion mutant lacking the N-terminal 36 amino acids ( IxBaAN ) almost completely abolished the Tax response .
Results of immunoblotting studies indicated that the IxBaWT and IxBoAN proteins were expressed at comparable steady-state levels ( see Fig .
3A ) .
Furthermore , titration experiments indicated that 10-to 20-fold higher concentrations of IxBaWT than of IxBaAN were required to achieve half-maximal inhibition of this re-sponse , thus precluding the possibility that these divergent functional effects were due to slight variations in effector plasmid input .
Conditional repression of Tax-dependent transcription .
In addition to NF- « B , Tax can also interface with distinct transcription factors , including serum-responsive factor ( 26 ) and members of the cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding pro-tein/activating transcription factor ( CREB/ATF ) family ( 83 , 89 ) , thus expanding the range of viral and cellular genes under Tax control .
In light of these findings , the altered in vivo function of IxBa produced by this N-terminal deletion ( Fig .
1 ) could reflect the inhibition of auxiliary components of the cellular transcriptional machinery other than NF-KB .

Conditional repression of Tax-dependent transcription .
Jurkat T cells were transfected with a Tax expression vector ( 5 pg ) , graded amounts of IxBaAN effector plasmid , and a CAT reporter construct under transcriptional control of either the HIV LTR ( 1 ag ) , HTLV-1 LTR ( 0.5 ug ) , c-fos promoter ( 1 ug ) , or IL-2Ra « promoter ( 5 ug ) .
Input DNA for all transfections ( 20 pg ) was normalized by addition of blank pCMV4 expression vector .
For each titration point ( r = 3 ) , the increase in reporter gene activity over basal levels is expressed as the mean percentage of CAT activity measured in control cells lacking the IxBaAN expression vector .
In IxBoAN-deficient cells , the Tax-dependent increases in CAT activity over basal levels ( fold induction ) were 21.6 + 3.3 ( HTLV-1 LTR ) , 8.0 + 2.8 ( HIV LTR ) , 10.6 + 2.7 ( c-fos promoter ) , and 10.7 + 0.2 ( IL-2R « promoter ) .
To evaluate the specificity of this interaction , titration studies were performed with the IxBaAN effector plasmid in Jurkat T cells cotransfected with Tax and distinct Tax-responsive reporter constructs driven by various naturally occurring promoters ( Fig .
2 ) .
Consistent with results obtained with the synthetic HIV- « kB-CAT construct , IxBaAN potently repressed the activity of the full-length HIV LTR in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
2A ) .
In contrast , IxBoAN failed to significantly down-regulate transcription directed from the HTLV-1 LTR , which responds to Tax by a CREB/ATF-dependent mechanism ( 83 , 89 ) .
As shown in Fig .
2B , Tax-induced transcription from the xB-responsive IL-Z2Ra promoter was also attenuated ( > 90 % ) A Anti-lkBa Anti-RelA REGULATION OF NF- « B ACTIVATION 2811 in cells expressing low doses of IxB « eAN .
However , higher doses of this deletion mutant in Tax-expressing cells led to only modest inhibitory effects ( < 15 % ) on the transcriptional activity of the c-fos promoter , a response mediated primarily through the indirect interaction of Tax with an intrinsic serum response factor-binding site ( 26 ) .
This pattern of promoter-specific repression confirmed that the N-terminal region of IxBa is selectively involved in the mechanism by which Tax deregulates the expression of NF- « xB-dependent transcription units .
In vivo interactions between ectopic IxBa and endogenous RelA .
The RelA ( p65 ) transactivator subunit of NF- « B serves as the high-affinity receptor for IxBa ( 5 , 11 , 27 , 86 ) .
This dynamic interplay between RelA and IxBa thus governs the subcellular distribution and transcriptional activity of NF-kB .
To examine whether these deletion mutants of IxBa interacted functionally with RelA , immunoprecipitation and gel retardation analyses were performed on cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from these T-cell transfectants .
To distinguish ectopic from endogenous IxBa in these studies , we used IxBa cDNAs that were fused in frame with sequences encoding the FLAG epitope ( 13 , 64 ) .
Results from CAT assays indicated that the presence of this epitope did not alter the functional phenotype of these IxBa constructs ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .
3A , these epitope-tagged derivatives of IxBa were efficiently expressed in the cytoplasm ( lanes 2 to 4 ) .
However , consistent with prior in vitro studies ( 34 , 39 ) , removal of the C terminus of IxBa completely disrupted its RelA-binding function ( lane 8 ) .
In contrast , the N-terminal deletion mutant of IxBa , which blocked the Tax transcriptional response ( Fig .
1 ) , retained the capacity to form stable complexes with endogenous RelA in the cytoplasm ( Fig .
3A , lane 7 ) .
To assess whether these complexes were functionally latent but competent for induction , Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for RelA and graded doses of each IxBa deletion mutant .
Nuclear extracts were then prepared from recipient cells and analyzed for « B-specific DNA binding activity in gel retardation assays .
As shown in Fig .
3B ( pCMV4 panel ) , two nucleoprotein complexes were detected with extracts from control cells expressing ectopic RelA .

Biochemical properties of IxBa deletion mutants .
( A ) Association with endogenous RelA .
Jurkat T cells were transfected with epitope-tagged derivatives of the indicated IxBa cDNA expression vectors ( 20 pg ) or with the unmodified parental vector ( pCMV4 ; 20 ug ) .
Cytoplasmic complexes containing ectopic IxBa were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography , fractionated by SDS-PAGE , and analyzed by immunoblotting with a peptide-specific antiserum for either IxBa « ( amino acids 1 to 29 and 289 to 317 ) or RelA ( amino acids 529 to 551 ) .
Sizes are indicated in kilodaltons .
( B ) Inhibition of nuclear ReIA/NF- « B DNA binding .
Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with a cDNA expression vector encoding human RelA ( 10 pg ) and graded doses of the indicated IxBa expression vectors .
Nuclear extracts ( 5 pg ) from transfectants were added to DNA binding reaction mixtures containing a **P-labeled palindromic kB probe ( xB-pd ) ( 8 ) and analyzed on native 5 % polyacrylamide gels .
Nucleoprotein complexes containing RelA homodimers ( upper arrow ) and NF- « B p50/ReIA heterodimers ( lower arrow ) are indicated .
( C ) Induction of nuclear NF- « B/ReIA activity .
Jurkat cells were cotransfected with cDNA expression vectors encoding RelA ( 10 ug ) , Tax ( 10 pg ) , and the indicated IxBa constructs ( 5 ug ) .
After 48 h of growth , cultures were treated with cycloheximide ( 50 pg/ml ! )
for 2 h in order to prevent the de novo synthesis of IxBa .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed in gel retardation assays as described above .
Nucleoprotein complexes containing RelA homodimers and p50/ReIA ( NF-kB ) heterodimers are indicated with arrows .
2812 BROCKMAN ET AL .
DNA-protein cross-linking and antibody binding studies ( data not shown ) indicated that the upper complex contained RelA homodimers and the lower complex contained p50/ReIA ( NF-kB ) heterodimers , which form as a result of RelA-mediated transactivation of the NF- « kB1 gene encoding pSO0 ( 84 ) .
Consistent with its defect in RelA binding , IxBaAC failed to inhibit these « B-specific activities when expressed over a wide concentration range ( AC panel ) .
However , even at low dosage , the wild-type and N-terminally deleted forms of IxBa completely blocked both of these DNA binding activities ( WT and AN panels ) .
As shown in Fig .
3C , coexpression with HTLV-1 Tax led to efficient inactivation of IxBaWT , as evidenced by the accumulation of functional RelA and NF-kB in the nuclear compartment ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
In contrast , Tax failed to activate latent complexes containing the N-terminally truncated inhibitor ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that the C-terminal portion of IxBa is required for efficient formation of latent NF-kB complexes in the cytoplasm of T cells , whereas the N-terminal segment of IkBa ( the SR domain ) subserves a distinct regulatory function that is required for Tax-mediated induction of nuclear NF- « B .
The SR domain of IxBa specifies determinants for targeted phosphorylation and degradation .
The transient induction of NF-kB during T-cell activation is dependent on the prior degradation of IxBa in the cytoplasm ( 10 , 19 , 80 ) .
In this context , we reasoned that the SR domain of IxBa , which lacks determinants for NF-xB binding , might regulate the stability of this inhibitor in the presence of HTLV-1 Tax .
To test this hypoth-esis , the steady-state levels of epitope-tagged IxBa protein and its N-terminally deleted counterpart were examined in Tax-expressing T cells .
To provide stringent control for these ex-periments , we also used expression vectors for Tax containing missense mutations that selectively disrupt its ability to access either the CREB/ATF ( Tax-M47 ) or the NF-kB/Rel ( Tax-M22 ) transcription factor pathway ( 77 ) .
Thus , Tax-M22 fails to induce the nuclear expression of NF- « B in Jurkat T lymphocytes , whereas the Tax-M47 mutant is fully competent to execute this function ( 77 ) .
As demonstrated by immunoblotting ( Fig .
4A ) , coexpression of IxBa with wild-type Tax led to a significant reduction in the steady-state level of cytoplasmic IxBa protein relative to that observed in Tax-deficient cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Consistent with their differing capacities to induce NF-kB , the degradative loss of ectopic IxBa was also evident in cells expressing the Tax- M47 mutant ( lane 4 ) but not in cells expressing the Tax-M22 mutant ( lane 3 ) .
In contrast to the destabilizing effects of Tax on wild-type IxBa , Tax and Tax-M47 both failed to mediate a decline in the steady-state level of the IxBaAN protein ( lanes 6 and 8 ) .
These results indicate that the SR domain of IxBa contains requisite regulatory determinants not only for NF- « B activation by Tax but also for Tax-induced degradation of IxBa .
Recent studies have shown that IxBa is phosphorylated prior to its degradative loss during normal T-cell activation ( 10 , 19 , 52 , 57 , 81 ) .
This labile phosphorylated form of IkBa is readily detected as a more slowly migrating electrophoretic variant that accumulates in cells treated with inhibitors of the proteasome degradation pathway ( 62 ) .
To determine whether the increased stability of IxBaAN was associated with an altered pattern of phosphorylation , we used the previously described proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( 62 ) in an attempt to prevent Tax-induced turnover of ectopic IxBa in transfected T cells .
As shown in Fig .
4B , a modified form of IxBaWT was weakly detected in cells treated with MG132 alone ( compare lanes 1 and 2 ) , presumably as a result of arrest of basal turnover in the absence of NF-kB inducer .
Expression of this electrophoretic variant of IxBa was substantially augmented in Mor .

The SR domain of IxBa « contains determinants for Tax-induced phosphorylation and degradation .
( A ) Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for the indicated epitope-tagged derivatives of IxBa ( 1 ug ) , wild-type Tax ( Tax-WT ; 10 pg ) , or Tax mutants ( 77 ) defective in either NF-kB ( Tax-M22 ) or CREB/ATF ( Tax-M47 ) activating function ( 10 pg ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts were fractionated by immunoaffinity chromatography , resolved by SDS-PAGE , and subjected to immunoblotting with an IxBa-specific antiserum .
NS , nonspecific .
( B ) Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding the indicated epitope-tagged derivatives of IxBa ( 5 ug ) in the presence or absence of a Tax expression vector ( 10 ug ) .
After 24 h of culture , samples were treated with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 ( 100 wM , 4 h ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared in the presence of a cocktail of phosphatase inhibitors ( 50 mM sodium fluoride , 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 10 M sodium molybdate , 50 M zinc chloride , and 20 mM B-glycerol phosphate ) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody .
Immune complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and probed on immunoblots with an IxBo-specific antiserum .
Major immunoreactive species are indicated with arrows .
Sizes are indicated in kilodaltons .
cells cotransfected with HTLV-1 Tax ( lane 3 ) , despite the ability of Tax to stimulate the breakdown of IxBa in MG132-deficient cells ( Fig .
4A ) .
On the basis of its selective sensitivity to calf intestinal phosphatase ( data not shown ) , this modified form of IxBa likely derived from an altered pattern of phosphorylation relative to the cytoplasmic pool of IxBa present in unstimulated cells .
Unlike IxBaWT , Tax apparently failed to mediate the induced modification of IxBaAN , as evidenced by the conspicuous absence of a characteristic electrophoretic doublet ( lanes 4 to 6 ) .
These results suggest that the SR domain of IxBa is essential for both signal-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of this cytoplasmic inhibitor .
Furthermore , the finding that MG132 prevents the breakdown of IxBaWT in Tax-expressing cells implicates the proteasome degradation pathway in the IxBa-dependent mechanism by which this retroviral gene product activates NF-kB .

The SR domain of IxBa « contains regulatory serine sites .
Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with HIV-xB-CAT ( 5 ug ) along with cDNA expression vectors encoding Tax ( 5 ug ) and the indicated site-directed mutants of IxBa ( 2.5 ug ) .
After 48 h of culture , cells were harvested and assayed for CAT activity .
Tax-dependent increases in reporter gene activity are expressed as a percentage of the activity induced in cells transfected with the IxBaWT ( WT ) effector ( fold induction = 29.9 + 2.6 ) .
Each bar represents the mean + standard error of the mean from at least three independent transfections .
rat ( 85 ) , avian ( 22 ) , porcine ( 23 ) , and human ( 34 ) homologs of IxBa revealed the presence of two strictly conserved serines within the SR domain ( Ser-32 and Ser-36 in human IKkBa ) that were absent in the IxBaAN construct .
These two serines are positioned within consensus phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II ( 33 , 63 ) .
To explore whether either Ser-32 or Ser-36 constitutes a site for regulatory phosphorylation events that permit Tax-induced activation of NF-kB , a series of specific amino acid substitutions were introduced into the full-length IxBa protein by site-directed mutagenesis .
As shown in Fig .
5 , substitution of alanine for either Ser-32 or Ser-36 in ectopic IxBa ( mutant S32A or $ 36A ) markedly attenuated Tax-mediated transactivation of HIV-kB-CAT in Jurkat T-cell transfectants .
These dominant-negative effects were highly selective , because IxBa constructs containing point mutations at two other potential phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal region of IxBa , including an alanine substitution at Ser-63 ( mutant S63A ) or phenylalanine for Tyr-42 ( mutant Y42F ) , failed to inhibit the Tax response .
To extend these findings , we attempted to reconstitute the signaling activity of IxBa mutants S32A and $ 36A by replacing alanine with charged amino acids that can function as phosphoserine mimetics ( 1 , 17 ) .
As shown in Fig .
5 , the ability of Tax to transactivate HIV-kB-CAT in the presence of ectopic IxBa was significantly reconstituted in vivo ( > 90 % relative to the wild type ) by introducing glutamic acid at either site ( mutants S32E and $ 36E ) .
However , introduction of alanine at the adjacent unmodified serine site ( Fig .
5 ; mutants S32A/836E and S $ 32E/836A ) converted these reconstituted IxBa mutants to a signaling-defective phenotype .
These results indicate that Ser-32 and Ser-36 function as independent regulatory sites within the SR domain of IxBa , both of which are critical for Tax-mediated induction of NF- « B .
Biochemical analyses of site-directed IxBa mutants .
To confirm that the observed dominant-negative phenotypes were due to specific defects in the signaling function of IxBa , we next performed studies with extracts from T cells transfected with select site-directed mutants .
As demonstrated by immunoblotting with RelA-specific antibodies ( Fig .
6A ) , variants of IxBa containing either an alanine or glutamic acid substitution at Ser-32 ( mutants S32A and S32E ) retained the capacity to associate with endogenous RelA complexes in the absence of REGULATION OF NF- « B ACTIVATION 2813 Tax ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , indicating that these mutations did not perturb the formation of latent NF- « B/IxBa complexes .
However , in keeping with their distinct functional phenotypes ( Fig .
5 ) , only IxBa mutant $ 32 failed to permit Tax-induced expression of NF- « B DNA binding activity in the nuclear compartment ( Fig .
6B , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
These data indicate that the $ 32A mutant of IxBa is a constitutive repressor of NF- « B with a specific defect in its ability to transduce Tax-dependent signals that uncouple NF- « B/IxBa complexes .
In contrast to this dominant-negative phenotype , introduction of glutamic acid rather than alanine at Ser-32 was sufficient to rescue the signal-transducing function of IxBa « in the presence of HTLV-1 Tax ( Fig .
6B , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
On the basis of the finding that deletion of IxBa sequences encompassing Ser-32 rendered IxBa refractile to Tax-induced degradation ( Fig .
4A ) , we next examined whether these two functionally distinct classes of point mutations differentially affected the steady-state levels of cytoplasmic IxBa in cells expressing wild-type or mutated forms of Tax .
As shown in Fig .
6C ( lanes 1 to 4 ) , expression of the S32E mutant of IxBa was selectively repressed in T cells transfected with wild-type Tax and Tax-M47 , both of which induce the NF- « B signaling pathway .
These results were fully consistent with that observed in cells expressing IxBaWT ( Fig .
4A ) .
However , replacement of Ser-32 with alanine rather than glutamic acid ( mutant $ 32A ) was associated with the escape of IxBa from Tax-induced breakdown ( Fig .
6C , lanes 5 to 8 ) , thus recapitulating the stability profile of the IxBaAN mutant in Tax-expressing cells ( Fig .
4A ) .
Taken together , these functional and biochemical results suggest that the phosphorylation status of Ser-32 and/or Ser-36 may influence Tax-induced entry of IxBa into its degradative pathway .
Constitutive repression of NF-B-directed transcription in activated T cells .
In addition to HTLV-1 Tax , expression of the active nuclear form of NF-kB in human T lymphocytes is posttranslationally induced by a number of cellular signaling pathways , including those mediated by cell surface receptors for antigen ( 41 ) and the cytokine TNF- « ( 19 , 61 , 74 ) .
Prior studies with Jurkat T cells have clearly demonstrated that activation of these pathways leads to the rapid degradation of endogenous IxBa ( 10 , 19 , 25 , 80 ) .
To examine these Tax-independent pathways for NF-kB activation , Jurkat T cells were transfected with cDNA expression vectors encoding either IxBaWT or a mutant lacking the SR domain and were then treated with TNF- « .
Alter-natively , transfectants were treated with PMA and ionomycin , a combination that simulates the effects of antigen receptor stimulation on protein kinase C activity and on release of ionized calcium from intracellular stores ( 24 , 50 , 88 ) .
As shown in Fig .
7 , both of these NF- « B agonists induced the rapid degradation of ectopic IxBaWT in transfected T cells ( lanes 1 to 5 ) .
However , forms of IxBa lacking the SR domain were resistant to degradation under either stimulatory condition ( lanes 6 to 10 ) .
Similar results were obtained with the S3ZA mutant of IxBa in T cells treated with PMA plus ionomycin ( data not shown ) , a finding that is fully consistent with the stabilizing effects of this point mutation on IxBa when introduced into Tax-expressing cells ( Fig .
6C ) .
To extend these biochemical results , we next assessed the functional properties of each IxBa mutant in T cells cotransfected with the HIV-kB-CAT reporter .
Both TNF ( Fig .
8A ) and PMA-ionomycin ( Fig .
8B ) stimulated < B-directed transcription from the HIV- « B enhancer in the presence of transfected IKxBaWT .
In contrast , induction of HIV- « B-CAT by these NF- « xB agonists was prevented in T cells expressing a deletion mutant of IxBa that lacked the Tax-responsive SR 2814 BROCKMAN ET AL .

DISCUSSION The amino terminus of IxBa specifies an SR domain .
Since its initial discovery in B lymphocytes ( 75 ) , NF- « B has emerged as an essential component of the inducible transcriptional machinery that mediates T-cell activation and growth ( 31 , 32 , 46 ) .
In addition , NF- « B is coopted by HIV and HTLV-1 to sub-serve distinct retroviral functions in infected CD4* cells ( 30 , 31 ) .
A hallmark feature of NF- « B is its extraordinary capacity to respond to a diverse range of physiologic and pathologic cues , including T-cell receptor ligands , cytokines , and viral proteins ( 32 ) .
It is now clear that the transcriptional activity of NF-kB is regulated from the cytoplasmic compartment by IxBa , which is rapidly degraded during cellular activation ( 9 , 10 , 19 , 20 , 25 , 35 , 80 , 81 ) .
However , a unifying explanation for how disparate viral and cellular stimuli converge on this enzy-matic checkpoint has remained elusive .
To examine this signaling mechanism in detail , we devised an approach to reconstitute human T lymphocytes with ectopic forms of IxBa that interface with the endogenous NF- « B signaling pathway .
When the wild-type IxBa cDNA was expressed in this in vivo system , the resultant ectopic protein fully recapitulated the inhibitory and signal-transducing functions of endogenous IxBa .
In contrast , a deletion mutant of IxBa lacking amino acids 1 to 36 ( IxBaAN ) failed to support NF- « kB-directed transcription from the HIV enhancer in cells stimulated with potent NF- « B inducers , including HTLV-1 Tax , TNF-a « @ , and combinations of phorbol ester and calcium iono-phore .
Based on coimmunoprecipitation and gel retardation studies , however , this dominant-negative form of IxBa retained both its NF- « B binding and inhibitory functions in unstimulated cells .
These in vivo results thus define N-terminal regulatory sequences in IxBa that integrate proximal biochemical signals leading to the induced nuclear translocation of NF- « B .
This SR domain of IxBa represents a key target for antigen- and cytokine receptor-mediated pathways that converge on the set of T-cell activation genes under NF-kB control .
The SR domain of IxBa is also inextricably linked to the pathophysiologic mechanism by which HTLV-1 Tax deregulates the function of NF-xB , resulting in the aberrant expression of a subset of these growth-related cellular genes .
Moreover , preliminary experiments conducted with stably transfected pre-B cells indicate that this region of IxBa is required for the induction of NF-kB in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( data not shown ) .
These findings do not exclude the possibility that the SR domain collaborates with other distal regulatory sequences in IxBa in order to govern its biologic activity .
For example , acquisition of this pleiotropic signaling function may also involve the C-terminal region of IkBa « ( amino acids 243 to 317 ) , which contains PEST sequences characteristic of many proteins that undergo rapid turnover ( 33 , 66 ) .
In this regard , we have found that removal of the entire PEST domain of IxBa disrupts its RelA binding function in vivo .
However , preliminary studies with an IxBa mutant retaining a portion of the PEST domain indicate the presence of additional determinants in this C-terminal region that may act in concert with the N-terminal SR domain of IxBa to mediate its signal-transducing function .
Role of IxBa in NF-KB induction by HTLV-1 Tax .
Recent studies with mice transgenic for the Tax gene suggest that the constitutive pattern of NF-kB expression in HTLV-1-infected REGULATION OF NF- « B ACTIVATION 2815 cells may be required to maintain a neoplastic state of deregulated growth control ( 45 ) .
Insights into the precise mechanism underlying this pathogenic virus-host interaction have been complicated by the pleiotropic effects of HTLV-1 Tax on the T-cell activation program and its ability to assemble with several components of the NF- « B pathway that are structurally and functionally related to IxBa .
These Tax-interactive components include the Rel-related precursors of the p50 and p52 NF-kB/Re !
l subunits ( p105 and p100 , respectively ) ( 12 , 36 , 87 ) , as well as IxBy ( 37 ) , which corresponds to the C-terminal half of p105 ( 38 ) .
Like IxBa , all three of these polypeptides contain multiple ankyrin motifs and inhibit the nuclear expression and DNA binding activity of select Rel polypeptides ( 9 , 38 , 53 , 58 , 65 ) .
However , evidence is currently lacking for either the presence of IxBy in human T cells or for Tax-induced processing of p100 and p105 to their functionally active subunits ( 42 , 82 ) .
This study provides four new lines of experimental evidence demonstrating that the SR domain of IxBa couples Tax to the host NF- « B signaling pathway .
First , Tax failed to stimulate the transcriptional activity of NF- « B-responsive promoters in cells expressing a deletion mutant of IxBa « ( IxBaAN ) that lacked this N-terminal regulatory region .
These inhibitory effects were selective , because the ability of Tax to transactivate promoters that function independently of NF-kB ( e.g .
, HTLV-1 LTR ) was unimpeded in cells coexpressing IxBoAN .
Second , in vivo expression of IxBaAN but not its wild-type counterpart prevented Tax-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kB .
Third , whereas Tax stimulated the turnover of wild-type IxBa , removal of the SR domain rendered this inhibitor completely resistant to Tax-induced degradation .
Taken together , these latter two findings establish a direct mechanistic link between the ability of Tax to stimulate the degradation of IxBa and to trigger the induction of nuclear NF-kB expression .
Fourth , point mutations in Tax that ablate its NF-kB-inducing function ( 77 ) also block the ability of Tax to stimulate IxBa breakdown , thus providing further evidence for the specificity and functional relevance of this virus-host interaction .
These findings extend two recent studies indicating that Tax induces the proteolytic breakdown of endogenous IxBa in both stable transfectants and HTLV-l-infected cells ( 42 , 82 ) .
Furthermore , the finding that IxBa accumulates in Tax-expressing cells following treatment with an inhibitor of the proteasome ( Fig .
4B ) implicates this specific degradation pathway in the mechanism by which Tax inactivates IxBa .
Function of the SR domain .
Prior biochemical studies have shown that IxBa is rapidly and transiently phosphorylated in response to T-cell activation signals before entering its degradative pathway ( 10 , 19 , 52 , 57 , 81 ) .
This inducibly phosphorylated form of IxBa accumulates in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors that completely block the activation of NF- « B , thus suggesting that phosphorylation is not sufficient to trigger the dissociation of intact IxBa from NF-kB ( 62 ) .
In this context , we have identified two regulatory serines within the SR domain of IxBa that influence its biologic activity in a conditional manner .
Specifically , substitution of either Ser-32 or Ser-36 with alanine largely disrupted the signal-transducing function of IxBa in response to either Tax , TNF- « , or PMA-ionomycin .
In contrast , introduction of a phosphoserine mimetic at these positions restored the in vivo signaling activity of IxBa .
Although direct proof that Ser-32 and Ser-36 are sites for either basal or induced phosphorylation is lacking , these mutational studies are consistent with this possibility .
Furthermore , phosphoamino acid analyses indicate that endogenous IxBa is basally phosphorylated primarily on serine and threo-nine residues ( data not shown ) .
Two findings reported in this study indicate that the SR 2816 BROCKMAN ET AL .
domain of IxBa plays an essential role in the targeting mechanism that facilitates recognition of IxBa as a proteolytic sub-strate .
First , we have observed that IxBa mutants lacking this domain escape from degradation in the presence of either Tax , TNF- « , or PMA-ionomycin , thereby blocking the nuclear translocation of NF-kB .
Second , deletion of the SR domain prevented the induction of a labile phosphorylated form of IxBa that has been previously detected in cells stimulated with a variety of NF- « B-inducing agents ( 10 , 19 , 20 , 52 , 57 , 81 ) .
These results demonstrate that the SR domain contains determinants that are critical for both signal-dependent phosphorylation and proteolysis of IxBa .
One potential explanation for these findings is that disruption of the N-terminal region of the inhibitor interferes with a regulated phosphorylation step ( s ) that serves to brand IxBa for rapid breakdown .
For example , our amino acid replacement studies suggest that agonist-in-duced changes in the phosphorylation status of the SR domain at Ser-32 and Ser-36 may influence the proteolytic stability of IxBa .
However , in light of emerging evidence for involvement of the proteasome in this process ( 62 ) , the possibility that the SR domain of IxBa functions in the acquisition of other distinct degradation signals can not be excluded .
Conclusions .
In summary , these studies reveal an SR domain within IxBa that is coupled to both viral and immune activation pathways for NF- « B induction .
Our findings support a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism for functional release of NF- « B from IxBa control involving determinants within the SR domain that direct the induced entry of IxBa into its degradative pathway .
In particular , site-directed mutations at two regulatory serines that are positioned within the SR domain of IxBa ( Ser-32 and Ser-36 ) produce constitutive repressors of NF-kB-directed transcription with potent activity in human T lymphocytes .
Such constitutive repressors , in combination with an appropriate delivery system , could prove applicable to the design of novel immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs .

ADDENDUM IN PROOF We have recently assembled evidence that simultaneous replacement of Ser-32 and Ser-36 with alanine prevents hyper-phosphorylation of IxBa in T cells treated with PMA-ionomy-cin .
These results provide further support for the proposed functional role of Ser-32 and Ser-36 in signal-dependent phosphorylation events that render IxBa susceptible to targeted degradation .
