The Regulation of the Human Tumor Necrosis Factor a Promoter Region in Macrophage , T Cell , and B Cell Lines* ( Received for publication , April 2 , 1992 ) Kristina L. Sidney H. Golub $ $ § , and James S. Economout || From the §Department of Microbiology and Immunology , { Division of Surgical Oncology , Department of Surgery , and Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center , UCLA School of Medicine , Los Angeles , California 90024 The 1311-base pair human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) a promoter region was fused to the luciferase ( Luc ) reporter gene and studied in a transient transfection system in three TNF producing cell lines , the U937 macrophage cell line , the MLA 144 T cell line , and the 729-6 B cell line .
This full length promoter construct can be induced by phorbol 13-myristate acetate ( PMA ) in each of these cell types .
Analysis of a series of 5'-truncations showed several peaks of basal and PMA induced activity suggesting the presence of several positive and negative regulatory elements .
A PMA responsive element was localized to a region between -95 and -36 bp relative to the transcription start site .
Within this region , single AP-2- and AP-1-like consensus sequences were noted .
These AP-2 and AP-1 sites were each modified with a double point mutation .
A modest ( 20-50 % ) reduction in TNF promoter activity was observed with the AP-2 site mutation .
However , mutation of the AP-1 site markedly diminished both the basal and PMA-activated promoter activity .
Also co-transfections of the wild-type promoter construct with an AP-1/c-jun expression vector resulted in augmented basal and PMA-induced promoter activity .
The inflammatory cytokine human tumor necrosis factor a ( TNFa ) , ' first discovered because of its ability to cause hem-orrhagic necrosis of tumors , can be induced in a number of different cell types such as macrophages , B cells , T cells , and NK cells ( 1-4 ) .
TNFa can be induced by a variety of induction signals that include phorbol esters , cytokines , and endotoxin ( 4-6 ) .
TNFa gene expression is complex being tightly regulated at the transcriptional , post-transcriptional , and trans-lational levels , very likely because of its role as an potent mediator of the inflammatory response ( 7-9 ) .

This study focused on the transcriptional regulation of human TNFa .
Using the protein kinase C agonist , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , as a strong induction signal for TNFa transcription , we have analyzed the induction of the TNFa promoter in macrophage , T cell , and B cell lines .
We undertook studies to determine if TNFa transcription was differentially regulated in these different cell types in response to PMA and also to identify which cis-acting sequences of the promoter are responsible for this regulation .
In order to address these questions , we employed a transient transfection system using three different cell types , the U937 macrophage cell line , the MLA 144 T cell line , and the 729-6 B cell line , all of which can be induced to produce TNFa in response to PMA .
The human TNFa promoter is a 1.3-kb intervening sequence between ( lymphotoxin ) and TNFa located on chromosome 6 .
We have isolated this full length 1311-bp TNFa promoter region and ligated it to the firefly luciferase ( Luc ) reporter gene .
Through the use of 5 deletion mapping , site-directed mutagenesis , and co-transfections with transcription factor expression vectors , our results indicate differential regulation of TNFa transcription in these different cell types and strongly implicates AP-1/c-jun as a mediator of transcriptional regulation of the TNFa promoter .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents-RPMI 1640 , Iscoves modified Dulbecco 's medium , fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , and antibiotics were obtained from Flow Labo-ratories .
Phorbol 13-myristate acetate ( PMA ) and ATP were purchased from Sigma .
D-Luciferin was purchased from Analytical Luminescence Laboratories ( San Diego , CA ) .
The promoterless luciferase plasmids , pXP1 and -2 , used in this work were the gift of Dr. S. Nordeen , University of Colorado ( 10 ) .
The 7-kb TNFS/TNFa genomic clone ( 11 ) was the gift of Dr. Michael Shepard ( Genentech , S. San Francisco , CA ) .
Cell Lines-The U937 human macrophage cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and passaged in RPMI 1640 , 10 % FBS , and penicillin , streptomycin , and fungizone ( PSF ) .
The MLA 144 T cell line and the 729-6 B cell line were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Iscoves modified Dulbecco 's medium , 10 % FBS , and PSF .
All cell types were fed 16-20 h prior to transfec-tion .
TNF Assay-A cytotoxicity assay based on the release of radioactivity from `` 'Cr-labeled actinomycin D ( 5 ug/ml ) -treated L929 cells was used as described earlier ( 6 ) .
Labeled L929 cells , in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % FBS , were plated at 5 X 10° cells/well in 96-well flat-bottomed plates ( Falcon ) , along with an equal volume ( 0.1 ml ) of TNF-containing supernatants or dilutions thereof .
After 18 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5 % CO ; incubator , 0.1 ml of the supernatant was retrieved and counted in a y-counter .
Standard concentrations of recombinant human TNFa ( Cetus ) were run to provide a dose-response curve and cytotoxicity was expressed in picograms of TNFa « / 10° cells by interpolation onto this standard curve .
This assay is highly specific for TNFa ; polyclonal rabbit antisera to TNFa but not TNF $ will abolish lytic activity .
Transfection-Cells were transfected using the technique of electroporation as described by Cann et al .
( 12 ) .
Cells were resuspended 22102 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g wou ; papeojumo ( TNFa Promoter Regulation in media ( RPMI 1640 for the U937 cells and Iscoves for the MLA 144 cells and the 729-6 cells ) + 20 % FBS at a concentration of 5 x 10° in 0.25 ml to which 10-25 ug of plasmid DNA was added .
Electroporation was performed with a single pulse from a Bio-Rad `` Gene Pulser `` apparatus with a capacitance extender unit ( 250 mV , 960 microfarad ) .
Cells were incubated on ice for at least 10 min before and after electroporation and then resuspended in 4 ml of media ( RPMI 1640 or Iscoves ) + 10 % FBS and plated in 6-well plates ( Costar ) .
The decay constant for these electroporations was generally between 45 and 60 ms .
Cell viability immediately after electroporation averaged 50-60 % .
We have performed co-transfections with a CMV LTR-CAT plasmid as an internal control ( the CAT gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter ) and observed less than 10 % variation in CAT activity between experimental groups ( 7 ) .
A CMV-Luc positive control was included in all assays to gauge transfection efficien-cies .
This value is included in the legends to the figures .
Luciferase Assay-Luciferase ( Luc ) was assayed as described by de Wet et al .
( 13 ) .
Transfected cells were harvested with a plastic policeman after 24 h of culture , washed , and resuspended in 100 Ll of lysis buffer ( 10 ) and cellular debris was pelleted in a microcentrifuge .
Twenty to thirty ul of cell lysate were assayed for luciferase using a Du Pont luminometer .
The luminometer records data as relative light units ( peak ) which is directly proportional to luciferase concentration over a 7-log range .
This instrument is sensitive down to the level of 10~ `` to 107° units of firefly luciferase .
Plasmid Construction-The techniques for plasmid construction were performed as described by Maniatis ( 14 ) .
The TNFa promoter region , a 1401-bp Puull/Ahall fragment was excised from the genomic clone of the human TNF $ and TNFa genes ( which had been cloned into pUC13pML and supplied by Genentech ) and blunt end ligated into the multiple cloning site of the promoterless luciferase plasmid pXP1 .
We have previously shown that the promoter ligated in the reverse orientation is inactive ( 7 ) .
Unidirectional deletions were then made in the forward orientation promoter constructs using exonuclease III as described by Heinkoff ( 15 ) .
Briefly , the plasmid containing the TNFa promoter in the forward orientation just upstream of the luciferase gene , pTNF ( -1311 ) Luc was digested with HindIII and the single stranded overhangs were filled in with thionucleotides to protect the ends from exonuclease III digestion .
The plasmid was then digested with Sall to expose a 5'-overhang just 5 of the beginning of the TNF promoter which would be susceptible to digestion with exonuclease HII and allow digestion into the promoter region .
The exonuclease III digests were performed at 37°C and aliquots were taken at 30-s intervals for a period of 10 min .
All samples were then S1 nuclease treated to create blunt ends and re-ligated .
To determine the extent of deletion into the 5 end of the promoter , each mutant was sequenced using the method of Maxam and Gilbert ( 16 ) .
Site-specific Mutagenesis-Site mutagenesis of the AP-1 and AP-2 sites were performed as described by Sayers et al .
( 17 ) .
Briefly , an oligonucleotide carrying the desired mutation was hybridized to a single stranded template carrying the TNF promoter region .
The oligonucleotide served as a primer for complete extension around the plasmid with thionucleotides , thus creating a mutant strand .
This complex was then nicked with Neol , which can not digest thionucleotides , and then treated with exonuclease III which almost completely digests away the wild-type strand while leaving the un-nicked mutant strand intact .
The remaining fragments of wild-type strand then serve as primers for complete extension again with Klenow to produce a double stranded plasmid carrying the desired mutation in each strand .
These mutants were then sequenced by the T7 dideoxy sequencing method .
Mutant promoter regions were ligated into pXP1 and re-sequenced using T7 dideoxy sequencing .
Transcription Factor Expression Plasmids-The transcription factor expression plasmids for AP-1/c-jun ( RSVeJun ) , AP-2 ( RD13 ) , and a frameshift mutant of AP-1/c-jun were all the gift of Dr. R. Chiu , UCLA .
Each was driven by the RSV promoter .
As a negative control for the co-transfections with the expression vectors , we used a construct which contains the luciferase gene driven by a truncated herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter , TK-Luc , designed by Dr. S. Nordeen , University of Colorado ( 10 ) , and purchased from ATCC .
RESULTS Induction of the TNFa Promoter-We have previously shown that a 615-bp TNFa promoter construct can be induced in the U937 cells by PMA ( 7 ) .
However , to fully explore the transcriptional regulation of TNFa , we have extended these 22103 studies using the full length 1311-bp human TNFa promoter region in these three cell lines ( Fig .
2 ) .
The promoterless luciferase ( Luc ) plasmid ( pXP1 ) and the Luc plasmid under the control of the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter ( CMV Luc ) were used as negative and positive transfection controls , respectively .
A construct in which a truncated thymidine kinase promoter was situated 5 to the luciferase gene was also used as a negative control in some experiments .
Constructs were transfected into each of the cell lines by electroporation and cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of PMA .
After 24 h of culture the cells were harvested and cell lysates assayed for luciferase content .
Each cell type supports promoter activity of the -1311 Luc construct ( Fig .
2 , A-C ) .
The promoter construct could be induced 10-fold by PMA in the U937 ( Fig .
24 ) and MLA 144 ( Fig .
2B ) cell lines , whereas it is induced only 3-5-fold in 729-6 ( Fig .
2C ) cells .
Basal activity of the full length promoter region appears to be higher in the 729-6 cell line which constitutively produces more TNFa ( see below ) .
5'-Deletion Analysis of the TNFa Promoter-To identify sequences important to promoter activity , 5 -truncations were introduced by unidirectional exonuclease III digestion of the -1311 promoter construct .
The deletions , as shown in Fig .
1 , range from -1251 bp down to -36 bp relative to the TSS .
The activity of these constructs in the U937 , MLA 144 , and 729-6 cell lines are shown in Fig .
2 , A-C. From these data , several observations can be made .
1 ) In the U937 cell line , all of the constructs except for the shortest ( -36 ) could be induced by PMA .
Absolute values for basal and PMA induced activity vary according to the length of the promoter , with peaks at -1185 , -615 , and -120 .
The indices of PMA induction for all the constructs ( except for -36 ) average 10-20-fold .
2 ) In a similar fashion , all of constructs except for -36 can be activated by PMA in the MLA 144 cell line .
The basal and PMA induced activity of each of the constructs largely mirror those in the U937 cells .
The indices of PMA induction in the MLA 144 cells for all of the constructs average 10-20-fold .
3 ) The 729-6 cell line differs significantly .
Only the five longest constructs can be activated by PMA .
While three peaks of basal activity are apparent , constructs shorter than seni ans ) gna .

Transfection of TNFa promoter constructs .
U937 , MLA 144 , and 729-6 cells were transfected with 10 ug each of the full series of 5'-truncations and cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of PMA ( 10-40 ng/ml ) , at which time cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity .

The indices of PMA induction for the constructs which can be activated by PMA average only about 2.5 .
The absolute values for basal activity are 5-10-fold greater in 729-6 cells .
Site-directed Mutagenesis of the TNFa Promoter-The results from this deletional analysis identified the sequences between -95 and -36 as the shortest region with PMA inducibility in the U937 and MLA 144 cell lines .
Several putative cis-acting consensus sequences are present within this 59-bp region ( Fig .
34 ) .
Of these , two are phorbol ester inducible , an AP-1-like site at position -66 to -60 and an AP-2-like site at position -36 to -28 .
To investigate the potential role these sites play in TNFa promoter induction , double point mutations were introduced into each of these putative cis-acting sequences .

in the -615 Luc promoter construct because of its strong activity in these cells .
In each cell type ( Fig .
3B ) , the AP-1 mutation resulted in a dramatic ( 90 % ) reduction in promoter activity .
Both basal and PMA-induced activity were significantly lower in U937 and MLA 144 cells and basal expression in 729-6 cells .
Despite this marked reduction , the AP-1 mutated construct could still be induced by PMA an average of 3-5-fold .
The AP-1 mutation in the -615 construct was shortened to -107 using a unique restriction enzyme digest .
This -107 AP-1 construct has comparable uninduced and PMA induced activity to the -615 AP-1 construct arguing against contribution of upstream sequences ( data not shown ) .
The AP-2 mutation caused a variable and generally only modest reduction in basal and PMA induced activity , with approximately 50-80 % of the wild-type activity remaining .
Co-transfections with AP-1/c-jun and AP-2 Expression Vec-tors-To further investigate the role of transcription factors AP-1 and AP -2 in TNFa promoter activity , we co-transfected the -615 Luc control , -615 AP-1 mut , and -615 AP-2 mut with expression vectors for the AP-1/c-jun ( RSVeJun ) and the AP-2 ( RD13 ) ( Fig .
4 ) .
Co-transfection of RSVeJun with the wild-type -615 construct augments basal and PMA duced activity a mean of 5-fold ( range 2-10-fold ) in each cell line .
Expression of AP-1/c-jun caused consistent augmentation of both basal and PMA-induced promoter activity in U937 and MLA 144 cells and basal activity in 729-6 cells .
Each of the 5'-truncation mutants were co-transfected with RSVc-Jun and each proved to be inducible by AP-1/c-jun expression ( 5-fold ) from -1311 down to -95 bp in U937 and 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g wou ; papeojumo ( TNFa Promoter Regulation A 200008 U937 B +RSVeJUN G « .as 100000 w < L < 3 $ Po Poo df £00 fo f $ % 5 ¢ B _ 200000 MLA 144 2 ER spuC is B +RSVJUN R J anbi3 % s % = 100000 % s _ & P 5 p Am in < L < 5 g it © E B & € & ' + & w & 8 0 s 6 ¢ 2 - © < .. < a s & in & © < © < C _ 20000 129-6 N spucos +RSVeJUN BJ .nois 10000 psssssss o % w < a < 3 < s & B & € 3 © & & a e wn bey 5 b 5 ® ¢ w * a - w bl p d. a a .

Co-transfection with transcription factor expression vectors .
U937 ( A ) , MLA 144 ( B ) , and 729-6 ( C ) cells were co-transfected with 10 ug of either the wild-type pTNF [ -615 ] Lue promoter construct , the AP-1 or the AP-2 mutation of this same construct , and 10 pg of either the AP-l/c-jun expression vec-tor ( RSVeJun ) or the AP-2 expression vector ( RD13 ) .
pUC18 was used as a control for the amount of DNA in each sample and had no effect on TNFa promoter activity .
Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of PMA for 24 h and cell lysates were assayed in triplicate for luciferase activity .
Results for the U937 transfection are representative of 15 experiments .
Results for the MLA 144 and 729-6 transfections are representative of 5 and 3 experiments , respectively .
The CMV-Luc controls for this experiment were : U937 , 999,000 light units ; MLA 144 , 86,000 light units ; and 729-6 , 95,333 light units .
MLA 144 cells ( data not shown ) .
The -36 construct was not inducible by AP-1/c-jun , indicating that the augmentation caused by AP-1/c-jun required the promoter sequences between -95 and -36 ( the region containing the AP-l-like consensus sequence ) .
Co-transfection with a frameshift mutation of AP-1 did not affect promoter activity ( data not shown ) .
The AP-2 expression vector had little , if any , effect on promoter activity .
When the AP-1 mutant construct was co-transfected with the AP-1/c-jun expression vector , a somewhat higher level of basal activity was noted .
The effects of the AP-1/c-jun expression vector were augmented by PMA activation but the activity of the mutated promoter was still only about 10 % of the 22105 400 300 J 200 | 100 j TNF a pg/10° cells Fo 4 o v § 1 v p T vo g E. v s T v p E & F do B & & t & 4 f go B & G E a .

TNFa protein production in transfected cells .
U937 , MLA144 , and 729-6 cells were either mock transfected or transfected with the AP-1/c-jun or the AP-2 expression vectors .
These cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 1 ng/ml PMA .
Cell-free supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h and assayed for TNFa production .
Results are expressed in picograms of TNFa/10® cells .

control activity .
The AP-2 expression vector also had little effect on promoter activity of the -615 AP-1 mutant .
Co-transfection of the AP-1/c-jun expression vector with the AP-2 mutated promoter region in some instances caused the same augmentation of activity as with the wild-type promoter .
However , these results with the AP-2 mutated promoter were less reproducible than the results with the -615 wild-type promoter and the AP-1-mutated promoter regions .
Co-transfection with the AP-2 expression vector had no effect on the AP-2 mutated promoter region .
Induction of TNFa Protein Production-U937 , MLA 144 , and 729-6 cells were transfected with either the AP-1/c-jun or the AP-2 expression vector or mock transfected ( Fig .
5 ) .
These cells were then cultured for 24-48 h in the absence or presence of PMA ( 1 ng/ml ) .
A substantial increase in TNFa production was seen by 24 h in the U93T7 cells transfected with the AP-1/c-jun expression vector .
No change was seen in the cells transfected with the AP-2 expression vector .
In the MLA 144 cells , similar results are seen although the increase in TNFa production in not noted until 48 h of culture .
The 729-6 cells do not show an increase in TNFa protein production levels when transfected with either expression vector although they do exhibit a significantly higher basal production of TNFa .
DISCUSSION We studied the activity of the 1.3-kb TNFa promoter region by ligating it to the firefly luciferase ( Luc ) reporter gene and using a transient transfection system in the U937 macrophage , MLA144 T cell , and 729-6 B cell lines .
The Jurkat T cell line was also studied and the results were found to be comparable to those in the U937 and MLA 144 cell lines { not shown ) .
The full length promoter construct was inducible in all three cell lines , although the index of induction by PMA in the 729-6 B cells was lower than the indices in the macrophage and the T cell lines .
The 729-6 B cell line constitutively produced higher levels of TNFa protein and therefore had a higher basal activity of the promoter .
Fourteen 5'-truncations , generated by exonuclease III digestion , ranging in length from -1311 to -36 bp relative to the TSS were tested in these cells .
Analysis of these 5'-truncations elicited 3 peaks of activity in the U937 and the MLA 144 cell lines in both basal and PMA-induced activity which suggests the presence of several negative regulatory elements in this promoter region as well as positive regulatory 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g wou ; papeojumo ( 22106 elements .
Although the basal and PMA-induced promoter activity was very similar in the U937 macrophage cell line and the MLA 144 T cell line , the 729-6 B cell line differed significantly in that only constructs 1105 bp and longer were consistently inducible by PMA .
This suggests that induction of TNFa transcription by phorbol ester may be mediated through different cis-acting sequences or by different transacting factors in different cell lines .
The shortest PMA-inducible construct was -95 bp in the U937 and MLA 144 cells .
All activity , including PMA induced activity , was lost in the -36 bp construct .
Although the inability to induce promoter constructs shorter than -100 has been reported ( 18 ) , we have reproducibly observed PMA induction in the -95-bp promoter region .
A possible explanation for this small discrepancy is our use of the luciferase reporter system which is at least an order of magnitude more sensitive than CAT assays .
Within the 95-bp promoter region are putative AP-1 , Sp-1 , and AP-2-like consensus sequences .
AP-1/c-jun is a ubiquitous transcription factor which recognizes the sequence , TGACTCA , usually in tandem repeats ( 19 , 20 ) .
AP-1 is a member of the jun proto-oncogene family and forms hetero-dimers with c-fos to activate transcription in response to growth factors , Ca®* ionophore and mitogenic agents such as phorbol ester .
The jun-fos heterodimer formation is mediated through a structural feature known as the leucine zipper , a stretch of leucines located in the carboxyl terminus of c-jun , which is a feature of some transcription factors ( 21-23 ) .
Each of the cell types chosen for this study have been shown to produce c-fos when stimulated with phorbol ester ( 24-26 ) .
AP -2 is another transcription factor which is more cell specific but is also responsive to PMA and binds to the consensus sequence TCCCCANGCG ( 27 , 28 ) .
In order to examine the role of AP-1 and AP-2 in TNFa transcription , double point mutations were introduced at the AP-1 and AP-2 sites of the -615 promoter .
The AP-1 mutation resulted in a dramatic reduction ( 80-90 % ) in absolute numbers for both basal and PMA induced activity in U937 and MLA 144 cells .
Basal activity was reduced in 729-6 cells , suggesting that this sequence plays some role in this B cell line .
The remaining 10-20 % activity could be due to partial binding of AP-1/c-jun to the mutated AP-1 site but is more likely due to the presence of other cis-acting sequences within the promoter .
Nevertheless , the same index of induction by PMA was noted for mutant and wild-type promoters , although the AP-1 mutation lowers the overall responsiveness of this construct by an order of magnitude .
Mutation of the AP-2 site caused a modest ( 20-50 % ) and less reproducible reduction in basal and induced activity .
Occasionally this mutation resulted in an augmentation of promoter activity .
The role of AP-2 in the regulation of the TNFa gene transcription does not appear to be significant in regards to induction by PMA .
Although AP-2 is a trans-acting factor known to be PMA responsive , it is also responsive to c-AMP and may or may not play a part in regulation through a protein kinase A pathway .
The context of the AP-2 binding site within the TNFa promoter may also influence its usefulness as a transcriptional activator for TNFa .
We sought to reinforce the evidence of a role for the AP-1 site by performing co-transfection with an AP-1 expression vector .
Co-transfection of AP-1/c-jun with the AP-1 mutated promoter still resulted in augmentation , although in a diminished fashion .
AP-1 could be acting on other sequences in the promoter , or weakly through the mutant site .
Co-transfection with the AP-2 expression vector had no effect .
TNFa protein production was generally observed to increase in the U937 TNFa Promoter Regulation and MLA 144 cell lines when these cells were transfected with the AP-1 expression vector .
This increase seemed to be both basal and PMA induced .
No increase was observed in transfections with the AP-2 expression vector .
This is consistent with the promoter studies .
The 729-6 cell line did not show an increase in protein production when transfected with either expression vector .
In this B cell line , only promoter constructs of 1105 bp or longer are PMA-inducible .
The AP-1 site at position -66 to -60 appears to play a role only in regulation basal activity .
For this reason , we would not expect increased TNFa protein production in AP-1 transfected cells induced with PMA .
The lack of increased basal production of TNFa may be due to the already high basal levels being produced by these cells .
AP-1 sites occur in several other cytokine promoters , such as IL-1 , IL-6 , CSF -1 , and TGF- $ 81 ( 24 ) , and appear to play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of IL-2 and IL-3 ( 29 , 30 ) .
Thus it appears that AP-1 might be involved in coordinate regulation of expression of these cytokine genes .
It is also possible that AP-1 in concert with other trans-acting factors may cause varied coordinate regulation of cytokine genes in different cell types or under different circumstances .
There are several other putative cis-acting sequences within the TNFa promoter region ( Fig .
2 ) .
Studies of murine TNFa promoter induction by LPS have suggested a role for NF « B-like consensus sequences ( 31 , 32 ) .
However , Maniatis et al .
( 33 ) reported that NF « B-like sequences were not required for induction by LPS in the human TNFa promoter .
Beutler et al .
( 8 , 9 ) have shown that a 3'-untranslated region of the TNFa gene , which has been shown to regulate TNFa expression in response to LPS at the post-transcriptional level , can also operate in concert with the promoter region of TNFa to mediate a transcriptional response to LPS .
These results indicate that : 1 ) induction of TNFa transcription by phorbol ester in a macrophage cell line and a T cell line may be mediated through a different group of cis-acting sequences than in a B cell line , suggesting heterogeneity according to cell type as a factor in transcriptional regulation of the TNFa gene ; 2 ) several positive and negative regulatory elements exist in the 1.3-kb TNFa promoter ; 3 ) the transcription factor AP-1/c-jun plays an important role in transcriptional regulation of this promoter ; and 4 ) the transcription factor AP-2 plays a lesser role , if any .
