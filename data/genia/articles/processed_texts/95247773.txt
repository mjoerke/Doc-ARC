Analysis of the Role of Protein Kinase C- « , -e , and -/ in T Cell Activation* ( Received for publication , December 7 , 1994 , and in revised form , February 3 , 1995 ) Elisabeth M.

123 , Lincoln 's Inn Fields , London WC2A 3PX , United Kingdom T cells express multiple isotypes of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and although it is well accepted that PKCs have an important role in T cell activation , little is known about the function of individual PKC isotypes .
To address this issue , mutationally active PKC-a « , -e , or - { have been transfected into T cells and the consequences for T cell activation determined .
p21 `` `` `` plays an essential role in T cell activation .
Accordingly , the effects of the constitutively active PKCs were compared to the effects of mutationally activated p21 `` .
The data indicate that PKC-e and , to a lesser extent PKC-a « but not - { , can regulate the transcription factors AP-1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT-1 ) .
The ability of PKC-e to induce transactivation of NF-AT-1 and AP-1 was similar to the stimulatory effect of a constitutively activated p21 `` `` ** .
PKC-e , but not PKC-a « nor activated p21 * `` , was able to induce NF-KB activity .
Phorbol esters induce expression of CD69 whereas none of the activated PKC isotypes tested were able to have this effect .
Activated Sre and p21 `` `` were able to induce CD69 expression .
These results indicate selective functions for different PKC isotypes in T cells .
Moreover , the data comparing the effects of activated Ras and PKC mutants suggest that PKC- « , p21 `` , and PKC-e are not positioned linearly on a single signal transduction pathway .
T cell activation via the T cell antigen receptor is associated with the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and the resultant production of inositol polyphosphates and diacylglycerols that regulate intracellular calcium and protein kinase C ( PKC ) , ' respectively ( 1 , 2 ) .
The term PKC refers to a family of closely related serine/threonine protein kinases for which at least 11 isotypes have been described ( 3 ) .
These isotypes can be classified according to their structure and cofactor requirements for activation .
They are all activated by phospholipids and , with notable exceptions , diacylglycerol ( DAG ) via an allosteric mech-anism .
However , they differ markedly in their sensitivity to Ca `` * .
PKC- , -B1 , -B2 , and -y are dependent on Ca** for activity , whereas PKC-e , -8 , -n , and -0 are not .
PKC-£ typifies a third group of PKC isotypes ( ¢ , A , : ) which also structurally belong to the PKC family , but atypically are not activated by phorbol * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

esters or DAGs ( 4 ) .
A fourth group of enzymes has been described recently that bind DAG/phorbol esters and have structural homologies with the PKC family , but have unusual catalytic domains ( 5 , 6 ) .
PKC isotypes have different substrate specificity in vitro suggesting that a particular PKC isotype may have a precise cellular function that reflects its cellular localization and substrate preferences in vivo .
PKC can regulate T cell activation genes via control of transcription factors .
For example , in the interleukin 2 gene en-hancer , the PKC responsive elements include sites for NF-KB , AP-1 , and nuclear factor of activated T cells , NF-AT-1 ( 2 , 7 ) .
The PKC controlled signaling pathways that regulate these transcription factors are not fully characterized but may involve the guanine nucleotide binding protein p21 ** , and the mitogen-activated protein kinases such as ERK2 and JNK1 ( 8 , 9 ) .
T cells express multiple isotypes of PKC including PKC-a , -B1 ( not -B2 ) , -8 , -e , -n , -0 , and - { ( 8 , 10 ) and understanding the role of these different isotypes of PKC in transcription factor regulation is a major challenge .
In particular , one complication is that most conclusions regarding the role of PKC in T cell activation are based on experiments that examine the effects of phorbol esters or synthetic DAGs which simultaneously activate multiple isotypes of PKC .
Moreover , it can not be excluded that phorbol esters may activate directly non-PKC signaling pathways .
For example , phorbol esters can bind to molecules other than PKCs such as rn-chimaerin ( 11 ) .
One approach to explore the role of a signaling molecule in T cells is to look at the functional consequences of transfecting cells with mutated constitutively active signal transduction molecules ( 12-14 ) .
PKC consists of a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain and an regulatory domain .
The activity of the catalytic domain is inhibited by a pseudosubstrate motif within the regulatory domain ( 15 ) .
Mutational activation of PKC by complete truncation of the regulatory domain generates a constitutively active PKC that can contribute to T cell activation ( 14 ) but has lost substrate specificity ( 4 ) .
A more refined mechanism for mutationally activating PKC is to make a single point mutation in the PKC pseudosubstrate sequence ( 16 ) that disrupts the interaction between the catalytic site and the pseudosubstrate sequence , but retains the regulatory domain that helps determine substrate specificity .
Such PKC mutants can be used to examine directly the functional effects of an individual PKC isotype , independent of the effects of phorbol esters or DAGs .
Accordingly , to examine the role of PKC in T cell activation , we have determined the consequences of expressing pseudosubstrate mutated PKC-a « , PKC-e , and PKC-£ .
These three isotypes were selected because they are representative of the three major subdivisions in the PKC family .
As well , analysis of PKC translocation has suggested that both PKC- « and PKC-e are regulated during T cell activation by phorbol esters ( 17 ) .
Of the many diverse PKC responses that could be explored 9833 9834 in this type of analysis , we chose to look at the regulation of three transcription factors that appear PKC responsive on the basis of phorbol ester experiments : AP-1 , NF-AT-1 , and NF-KB .
We also looked at the effects of the different PKC isotypes on expression of the cell surface antigen CD69 .
Finally , the effects of the PKC mutants in T cells was compared with the effects of v-src , a constitutively active tyrosine kinase , and constitutively active p21 `` , v-Ha-ras .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Reagents-Ionomycin ( Ca** salt ) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate were from Calbiochem Corp. ( United Kingdom ) .
UCHT-1 ( reactive with CD3 ) was used at 10 ug/ml in culture .
[ **C ] Acetyl coenzyme A ( at 50-60 mCi/mmol ) was from Amersham International ( Buckinghamshire , UK ) .
Other reagents were from Sigma .
Specific antisera against the different PKC isotypes were raised against the COOH-terminal peptide from the proteins .
Monoclonal antibodies against rat CD2 ( OX-34 ) or p85 were purified from hybridoma supernatants .
Rabbit anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Amersham International .
Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibodies anti-CD69 ( Leu'-FITC , IgG , ) are from Becton Dickinson ( Mountain View , CA ) .
Plasmid Constructs-Reporter constructs ; NF-KB-CAT : contains 3 copies of the sequence for the NF site ( AGCTTGGGACTTTCCATGG-GACTTTCCTAGGGATTCCCC ) , and AP-1-CAT contains 3 copies of the sequence for the AP-1 site ( AGCTATGAGTCTCAGTGATCAGT-GAGTCA ) .
These sequences have been inserted in pBLCAT2 to generate NF-KB-CAT and AP-1-CAT , respectively ( 18 ) .
NF-AT-CAT contains 3 copies of the sequence 5 ' corresponding to the sequence from positions -284 to -258 relative to the start of transcription of the interleukin 2 gene , upstream of the interleukin 2 minimal promoter driving the reporter gene CAT .
This sequence has been identified as the binding site for NF-AT-1 , the ARRE-2 site of the human interleukin 2 enhancer ( 19 ) .
PKC Mutants and Active Oncogene Containing Plasmids-The pMT-2 vector was used to express PKC-a « ( 20 ) and PKC-e ( 21 ) and the pCO , vector was used to express PKC-£ ( 22 ) .
The constitutively active PKC clones are full-length a , e , and { cDNAs with a single point mutation in their inhibitory pseudosubstrate sequences within the regulatory domain .
Mutants in the pseudosubstrate sequence were generated by substitution of a glutamic acid for an alanine in position 25 ( PKC- « E25 ) , position 159 for PKC-e ( PKC-eE159 ) , and position 119 for PKC- { ( PKC-£E119 ) .
The PKC-a « and PKC- mutants are known to be constitutively active in vivo and in vitro ( 16 , 23 , 24 ) .
The wild type ( wt ) counterparts of these mutants PKC-a wt , PKC-e wt , and PKC-£ wt , were included in the experiments as controls .
Other plasmids directing expression of constitutively active p21 `` `` * `` * `` ( pEF Ras ) , v-raf ( pEF Raf ) , and v-src ( pEF Sre ) were used and are described elsewhere ( 13 ) .
The CMVrCD2 construct contains a cytoplasmic domain truncated version of the rat CD2 gene ( 25 ) .
All plasmids were purified by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCVethidium bromide gradients using standard procedures .
Celis and Transfections-JH6.2 , a subline of the human T acute lymphocytic lymphoma cell line Jurkat ( 26 ) , was maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated fetal calf serum , at 37 °C in 5 % CO , in humidified air .
Cells were transfected via electroporation ( gene pulser : Bio-Rad , UK ) according to the manufacturer 's instruc-tions .
Briefly , cells were pulsed ( 10 `` cells/0.5 ml ) in complete medium at 960 microfarads and 340 mV .
Cells transfected with similar plasmid mixtures were pooled and re-aliquoted before stimulation .
Transfected cultures were cultured and stimulated as indicated .
Conditions and quantities of DNA for transfection were optimized for each plasmid and each plasmid preparation .
Transfection efficiencies ranged from 20 to 35 % .
For the reporter constructs AP-1 , NF-KB , and NF-AT-1 , between 0.5 and 20 ug of DNA/1O0 `` cells was used .
For v-sre and v-Ha-ras and PKC expression constructs , 5-25 ug of DNA/10* cells was used .
Western Blots Analysis-Total cell lysates were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
Proteins were transferred to poly-vinylidine difluoride membranes ( Immobilon , Millipore ) by overnight Western blot .
Membranes were immersed in PBS/ITween 20 , 0.5 % , ( PBST ) plus 5 % milk for 2 h to block nonspecific binding .
Anti-PKC isotype antisera or p85 « antibodies were diluted 1/3,000 to 1/5,000 in PBST + 1 % milk and were allowed to react with the membrane overnight at 4 °C .
After extensive washes , membranes were incubated with a 1/15,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies ( for PKC immun-sera ) or rabbit anti-mouse Ig ( for p85 antibodies ) in PBST for 1 h at room temperature .
After the washes in PBST and PBS , membrane bound antibodies were visualized by use of ECL Western blotting de- Protein Kinase C in T Cell Activation tection reagents ( Amersham ) and Kodak XS1 films .
CAT Assays-CAT assays were performed as described previously ( 12 ) .
Briefly , 10 `` cells were lysed in 50 ul of 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 10 mM Tris , pH 8 , 1 mm EDTA , 150 mm NaCl for 10 min on ice .
Cellular debris as pelleted and the lysates heated at 68 °C for 10 min before use .
Assay conditions were 150 mM Tris , pH 8 , 0.05 Ci of [ **Clacetyl coenzyme A , and 2 mM chloramphenicol .
Chloramphenicol was extracted with ethyl acetate , and the amount of radioactivity in the acetylated products and nonacetylated substrate of each reaction was determined by liquid scintillation counting of organic and aqueous phases , respectively .
The percentage of chloramphenicol acetylation is calculated and results are presented as such or as -fold increase of the control response .
FACS Analysis-Cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated Leu** antibodies ( human CD69 ) for 30 min at 4°C and then washed three times in PBS containing 4 % fetal calf serum prior to analysis with a FACScan fluorocytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) .
For analysis of rat CD2 and human CD3 antigens , cells were incubated with 5 ug/ml OX-34 ( rat CD2 ) or UCHT-1 ( human CD3 ) antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C , washed , and thereafter incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin for 30 min at 4 °C , prior to FACS analysis .
Propidium iodide was used to exclude dead cells from analysis .
RESULTS PKC-a and PKC-e Are Able to Induce AP-1 Activity in Jurkat Cells-In fibroblasts , expression of pseudosubstrate mutated PKC-a has been shown to induce AP-1 activity ( 16 ) .
To assess the ability of the mutated constitutively active PKC- , -e , and - { to induce the transcription factor AP-1 in T cells , we employed transient transfection protocols and quantitation of the expression of a CAT reporter gene whose activity is regulated by a trimer of the AP-1 binding site .
Jurkat cells were cotransfected with the AP-1-CAT construct plus one of the expression constructs encoding the different PKC isotypes .
The samples were harvested 18 h after transfection and the induction of AP-1-CAT activity was determined ( Fig .
1 ) .
Basal AP-1 activity measured in T cells , in the absence of stimulus , is low and PDBu induced a 6-8-fold increase in the AP-1 activity ( Fig .
1A ) .
In parallel experiments and as a positive control , cotransfection of a constitutively active Ras mutant , p21 % `` * `` * , induced a level of AP-1 activity comparable to the level of PDBu induced AP-1 activity .
Similarily cotransfection of v-sre , a constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase resulted in transactivation of AP-1 ( Fig .
14 ) .
When PKC mutants were cotransfected with AP-1 in an identical procedure , PKC-eE159 and PKC-aB25 were found to transactivate the AP-1-CAT reporter construct .
PKC-eE159 induced a level of AP-1-CAT comparable to that seen in phorbol ester-stimulated cells , whereas PKC-aB25 was consistently less effective ( Fig .
1B ) .
The data in Fig .
1C compare the kinetics of AP-1 induction in response to PKC-aBE25 and PKC-eE159 mutants and show that the kinetics of AP-1 induction by the two isotypes are similar in Jurkat cells .
AP-1-CAT activity was not regulated by the mutant nor by cotransfection of expression plasmid encoding wild type PKC-a @ , -e , or - { .
Increasing the amount of the PKC-£E119 expression vector used in the experiments had no effect on AP-1 activity at any time point tested ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether the failure of the PKC-¢E119 mutant to transactivate AP-1 was due to insufficient expression of the enzyme , Western blot analysis of PKC isotypes in transfected cells was performed .
JH6.2 cells constitutively express PKC- « , -e , and -£ .
The point mutated PKC isotypes will migrate at a similar molecular weight as the endogenous isotypes and have an identical immunoreactivity as the endogenous enzyme .
However , an increase in the total cellular levels of the particular PKC isotype is an indication that the transfected gene is efficiently transcribed and translated into the final PKC product .
The Western blots in Fig .
2 show that endogenous detected in control empty vector transfected cells , migrates as an 80-kDa band .

PKC-£E119 is expressed in pCO , -PKC-£E119 transfected Jurkat cells .
10 `` Jurkat cells were transfected with PKC-£E119 or the empty vector and total cellular extracts prepared at the indicated time after transfection .
Western blots were performed as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
The expression of the p85 « subunit of phos-phatidylinositol 3-kinase kinase , monitored to control the loading of the gel , is shown in the bottom panel .
mum level 16 h post-transfection .
This level was maintained for at least 24 h. The failure of the PKC- { E119 mutant to transactivate AP-1 was thus not due to insufficient expression of the enzyme .
Jurkat cells constitutively express PKC-a and -e. The functional effects of the mutated PKC-a « E25 and PKC-eE159 were easy to demonstrate but no increases in the total level of PKC-a « and -e were detected in cells transfected with the PKC-aB25 and PKC-eE159 mutants ( data not shown ) .
Endogenous PKC-a and -e are expressed at high levels in Jurkat cells and these data suggest that the activated mutants are expressed at a low level relative to the endogenous wild type enzyme .
PKC-a and PKC-e Are Able to Induce NF-AT-1 Activity-The transcriptional factor NF-AT-1 is a complex of AP-1 and NF-ATp ( 7 ) .
There is a two-signal requirement for NF-AT-1 activation which reflects that calcium regulated signals induce NF-ATp translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus , whereas PKC or p21 `` is proposed to induce AP-1 .
The data in Fig .
3A show that the calcium ionophore ionomycin alone has a weak inductive effect on NF-AT-1 but ionomycin and PDBu synergize for maximal activation .
Expression of v-sre can substitute for both ionomycin and PDBu signals and transactivate NF-AT-CAT .
The constitutively active Ras mutant , v-Ha-ras alone , has no inductive effect on NF-AT-1 , but can synergize with ionomycin for NF-AT-1 induction ( Fig .
3A ) .
To study the role of PKC in the induction of an active NF-AT-1 complex , cotransfection experiments were carried out using the PKC-eE159 , PKC-oE25 , and PKC- { E119 mutants .
The data in Fig .
3B show that the PKC-eE159 and PKC-aE25 mutants alone had no effect on NF-AT-1 activity but were able to induce NF-AT-1 in the presence of ionomycin .
Neither PKC-£ { E119 , nor the wild type PKC-a « , -e , and - { isotypes were able to induce significant NF-AT-CAT activity , either alone or in combination with ionomycin .
PKC is proposed to regulate NF-AT-1 via effects on AP-1 .
The PKC-eE159 mutant was repeatedly more effective than PKC- « E25 for NF-AT-1 induction , which is consistent with the relative potency of these constructs on AP-1 activity shown in Fig .
1 .
In kinetic experiments , the synergy between ionomycin and PKC-eE159 and PKC-aE25 mutants for NF-AT-CAT induction were readily detected 2 h after stimulation ( Fig .
3C ) .
of the control response for PDBu- , PKC-aE25- , and PKC-eE159-treated cells was 10 , 3 , and 5 , respectively .
C , cells were cotransfected with the AP-1-CAT reporter construct and empty vector or PKC-aE25 or PKC-eE159 plasmids .
Cells were either left unstimulated , or stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDBu immediately after transfection .
Cells were harvested at different time points after transfection and the data show the CAT activity as percentage conversion monitored from cell extracts .
9836 PKC-e Is Able to Induce NF-KB Activity-NF-KB , a PKC-regulated transcription factor , is a heterodimer composed of 2 DNA binding subunits which are members of the re ?
family ( 27 ) .
To assess the ability of the different PKC isotypes to transactivate NF-KB , PKC-eE159 , PKC-aE25 , and PKC- { E119 expression constructs were cotransfected with an NF-KB-CAT construct .
The samples were harvested 18 h after transfection and CAT activity was determined .
As controls , cotransfection experiments were performed with constitutively activated Ras , v-Ha-ras , and an activated protein tyrosine kinase , v-src .
The data in Fig .
4 a show that NF-KB-CAT activity in unstimulated JH6.2 cells can be increased 3-4-fold with phorbol ester stimulation .
Cotransfection of an activated tyrosine kinase v-srce was also able to increase NF-KB activity 2-3-fold , but constitutively active v-Ha-ras had no significant effect .
This was in marked contrast to the strong transactivating effect of the Ras mutant on AP-1 and NF-AT-1 ( Figs .
1A and 34 ) .
As shown in Fig .
4B , only PKC-eE159 was able to induce NF-KB activity , and cotransfections carried out with the PKC-a625 or PKC- { E119 mutants had no detectable effect on NF-KB-CAT activity .
In kinetic experiments , NF-KB activity was detected between 2 and 4 h after transfection of PKC-eE159 , whereas no significant effect of PKC-oB25 or PKC- { E119 mutants was detected at any time point ( Fig .
4C ) .
PKC-a , PKC-e , PKC- { Are Unable to Induce CD69 Expres-sion-The CD69 antigen is rapidly expressed at the cell surface in response to triggering of the T cell receptor or activation of T cells with phorbol esters ( 28 ) .
The effects of phorbol ester led to the conclusion that PKC controls the surface expression of CD69 .
It is now also recognized that p21 `` `` is involved in CD69 induction .
Thus transfection of a constitutively active Ras mutant into Jurkat cells induces CD69 expression , whereas transfection of a dominant negative Ras mutant prevents phorbol ester regulation of this surface antigen ( 25 ) .
In an attempt to identify which isotype of PKC could be involved in the induction of the CD69 molecule in T cells , plasmids encoding the different PKC mutants were transfected in Jurkat cells and the expression of CD69 monitored by FACS analysis .
Results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig .
5 .
Optimal conditions to follow the induction of CD69 by a transfected plasmid were established by using the constitutively active v-sre construct .
Fig .
5a shows that the JH6.2 subclone of Jurkat does not express CD69 in the absence of stimulus but PDBu is able to induce CD69 expression .
In cells transfected with v-src , a subpopulation of cells can be seen to express CD69 to levels comparable to that seen in the PDBu-stimulated cells .
Phorbol esters will activate all of the Jurkat cells , whereas the efficiency in transient transfection protocols means that only a subpopulation of cells will express the activated Sre mutants .
Thus in each experiment , cells were transfected with an expression construct encoding a truncated rat CD2 antigen as a surface tag .
The transfection efficiency can then be estimated by fluorescence analysis of rat CD2 expression .
In the experiment shown in Fig .
5 , the transfection efficiency from the CD2 analysis was 35 % ( Fig .
5b ) and in the v-src transfected cells ( Fig .
5¢c ) , a comparable percentage of the cells became CD69 positive , with a mean fluorescence intensity similar to that seen with PDBu-stimulated cells ( Fig .
5a ) .
Expression of activated p21 `` * `` also induced CD69 expression ( Fig .
5d ) so that approximately 15 % of cells became CD69 positive .
CD3 expression was not affected by transfection of v-src or v-Ha-ras ( data not shown ) .
The weaker effect of v-Ha-ras compared to v-sre was consistently observed in seven experiments .
There was no synergy between phorbol ester and ionomycin or activated Ras and ionomycin for CD69 expression .

It has been suggested that signals from PKC and p21 `` converge to control the activity of the protein serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 ( 29 ) ; we therefore examined the functional effect of expressing a constitutively active Raf kinase , partly to determine whether there were any intrinsic difficulties in using activated protein serine/threonine kinases for the CD69 induction assay .
Preliminary experiments confirmed that a truncated Raf protein , v-raf , could replace activated p21 `` ** or phorbol esters for induction of AP-1 and NF-AT-1 in CAT assays .
Expression of v-raf could also mimic the effect of v-Ha-ras for CD69 induction ( Fig .
5e ) .
DISCUSSION The present series of experiments have explored the ability of constitutively active pseudosubstrate mutated variants of PKC- « , PKC-e , or PKC-£ to regulate the activity of the transcriptional factors AP-1 , NF-AT-1 , and NF-KB .
Phorbol esters can stimulate AP-1 activity in T cells and synergize with calcium signals to regulate NF-AT-1 .
The data show that the constitutively active mutants of PKC- « and -e , PKC-a625 , PKC-eE159 , can mimic phorbol esters for both AP-1 and NF-AT-1 induction .
However , the phorbol ester effect on AP-1 and NF-AT-1 was not mimicked by mutated PKC-/ .
Moreover , expression of the constitutively active PKC- { E119 alone was not sufficient to induce any of the T cell responses examined and this enzyme must therefore have a different role in T cells than the phorbol ester/DAG regulated PKC isotypes such as PKC-a or -e. The failure of the activated PKC-£ mutant to mimic phorbol ester in T cell activation is not unexpected since this enzyme is not regulated by phorbol esters , either in vitro or in vivo .
However , the lack of response of PKC-£ to phorbol esters does not preclude that this enzyme might have some functional effects on T cell activation which could reflect its involvement in the signal transduction pathways controlled by other lipid second messengers .
For example , in vitro , shares with other PKC isotypes the ability to be regulated by the D-3 phosphoinositide phos-phatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate ( 80 ) .
As well , experiments in fibroblasts using dominant negative mutants of PKC-£ or overexpression of PKC- { wt have suggested a role for this PKC isotype in NF-KB induction ( 31 ) .
The expression of constitutively active PKC-£ or the overexpression of PKC-/wt is not sufficient for NF-KB transactivation in T cells which could reflect that the mechanisms of NF-KB regulation in T cell and fibroblasts differ .
One aim of the present study was to see whether PKC-a and -e have different functional effects in T cells .
The data show that the constitutively active PKC- « £25 and PKC-eE159 have similar effects on AP-1 and NF-AT-1 induction , but are different in that PKC-eE159 could transactivate an NF-KB reporter gene , whereas PKC-aR25 could not .
was consistently less efficient than PKC-eE159 for transactivation of NF-AT-1 or AP-1 .
The explanation for this difference is not known and it is possible that it reflects that PKC-oB25 is less efficiently expressed than PKC-eE159 , possibly due to intrinsic differences in the stability of these two mutated PKC isotypes .
This point was difficult to assess since transfected PKC-a625 and PKC-eE159 could not be dissociated from their endogenous ( wild type ) counterparts in Western blot analysis .

The effect of PKC- « , -e , and - { on CD69 expression .
10 `` Jurkat cells were transfected with one of the expression vectors containing either a mutant or a wild type PKC-a , -e , - { , v-sre , v-Ha-ras , rat CD2 , or with the empty vector .
After transfection , cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDBu , 4 h after transfection for 18 h. Cells were harvested , washed , and stained for CD69 expression and histogram analysis of CD69 induction on the cell surface are shown .
Log of fluorescence intensity is measured on the x axis and cell number on the y axis .
Jurkat cells transfected with rat CD2 were analyzed for rat CD2 expression in b , while cells were stained with anti-CD69 antibodies in panels a and c-A .
Unstimulated cells transfected with the empty vector are shown in the white histogram while cells stimulated with PDBu ( a ) or transfected with an active plasmid ( c- ) are shown in the black histogram .
Staining is shown with Jurkat cells transfected with the empty vector and with PDBu stimulation ( a ) ; c , cells transfected with v-src ; d , with v-Ha-ras ; e , with PKC-a625 mutant ; f , with PKC-eE25 mutant ; g , with PKC- { E119 mutant .
The data from one experiment are shown but seven experiments were performed .
The transfection efficiency based on rat CD2 expression ranged from 30 to 38 % ; 83.5 + 2.2 % CD69 positive cells were induced in response to transfection with v-sre ; 16.3 + 6.3 % CD69 positive cells were induced in response to transfection with v-Ha-ras ; 11.9 + 1.3 % CD69 positive cells were induced in response to transfection with v-rof ; 1.2 + 1.8 % CD69 positive cells induced in response to transfection with PKC-aB25 ; 1.5 + 1.9 % CD69 positive cells induced in response to transfection with PKC-eE159 ; 2.2 + 2.1 % CD69 positive cells induced in response to transfection with PKC-£E119 .
differences between PKC-oE25 compared to PKC-eE159 for - AP-1 and NF-KB family of transcriptional factors .
AP-1 and NF-AT-1 activation were at most 2-fold .

- response ( 32 ) .
This observation , combined with a requirement Accordingly , it would seem that there is a real difference in the - for Ras function for phorbol ester regulation of interleukin 2 relative ability of PKC- « E25 and PKC-eE159 to regulate the - gene expression ( 8 ) led to the idea that PKC functioned up Protein Kinase C in T Cell Activation stream of p21 `` in T lymphocytes .
The relationship between PKC and Ras in other cell lineages is more complicated , par-ticularily in fibroblasts , where it has been suggested that PKC may function both upstream and downstream of Ras .
In the present study , we have compared the effect of a constitutively active Ras protein and constitutively active PKC-a and -e mutants on T cell responses .
If either of these isotypes functioned directly upstream or downstream of p21 `` , then it would be expected that the functional effects of the active PKC mutants , PKC-aBE25 and PKC-eE159 , would be the same as the effects of an `` activated `` Ras protein , p21 `` ~ `` * `` * , For AP-1 and NF-AT-1 induction , p21Y `` * `` * `` , PKC- « E25 , or PKC-eE159 have comparable effects and can mimic the effect of phorbol esters .
However , PKC-eE159 could stimulate NF-KB , whereas the activated Ras mutant could not , which indicates clearly that not all PKC functions in T cells are mediated by p21 `` .
p21 `` ** controlled signaling pathways are necessary for regulating surface levels of the CD69 antigen and thus transfection of p21 `` alone into Jurkat cells results in the expression of CD69 ( 25 ) .
If PKC-a or -e function upstream of p21 `` then it would be predicted that cells transfected with activated mutants of PKC would also express CD69 .
The data in the present report show that phorbol ester treatment of T cells induces CD69 as does transfection of v-sre .
Transfection of v-Ha-ras is also able to induce CD69 in JH6.2 cells , although consistently to a lesser extent than v-src .
In contrast , expression of PKC-aE25 and PKC-eE159 failed to induce CD69 expression .
The implication from these data are that phorbol ester induction of CD69 is not mediated by PKC-a « or PKC-e , and therefore is likely to be regulated by another PKC isotype or , alternatively by another phorbol ester-dependent effector .
Moreover , the data suggest that neither PKC-a nor PKC-e regulate the activity of p21 `` .
In this context , p21 `` functions upstream of the protein serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 in many cells , and thus cells expressing constitutively activated Ras and Raf proteins have a similar phenotype .
In the present report , v-Ha-ras and v-raf have a comparable effect on CD69 expression which illustrates that there is no intrinsic problem associated with the induction of CD69 by a constitutively active protein serine/ threonine kinase .
Thus the simplest interpretation of differences between the functional effects of v-Ha-ras and PKC-a625 or PKC-eE159 with regard to CD69 induction is that these molecules are not positioned linearily in the same signaling pathway .
Nevertheless , their similar effects on AP-1 and NF-AT-1 induction indicated that there must be some point of convergence of Ras and PKC- @ w/e signals .
One such convergence point for Ras and PKC could be at the level of the extracellular signal-regulated or mitogen-activated protein kinase ( ERKs/ MAPKs ) cascade ( 33 , 34 ) .
T cells express more than one member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family including ERK-2 and JNK-1 ( 34 , 35 ) .
It is thus possible that p21 ** and PKC-a and -e activate AP-1 and NF-AT-1 via parallel pathways that use different members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family .
The point of convergence of the signaling pathways would thus be in the nucleus at the level of transcrip- 9839 tional factor phosphorylation .
In conclusion , it has been known for several years that T cells express multiple isoforms of PKC .
The present study has shown that phorbol ester regulation of the transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-AT-1 can be mimicked by constitutively active PKC-a and -e. PKC-e can transactivate NF-KB whereas PKC-a « could not .
PKC-£¢ had no effect on AP-1 , NF-AT-1 , or NF-KB transactivation and its role in T cells is not yet discov-ered .
These experiments indicate that different PKC isotypes may have selective physiological functions in T cell responses .
