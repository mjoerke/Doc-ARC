CD4 Promoter Transactivation by Human Herpesvirus 6 LOUIS FLAMAND , *'* FABIO ROMERIO , * MARVIN S. REITZ , * anp ROBERT C. GALLO Laboratory of Virology , Rheumatology and Immunology Research Center , Centre de Recherche du CHUL and Laval University , Sainte-Foy , Quebec , Canada , `` and Institute of Human Virology , University of Maryland , Baltimore , Maryland 212012 Received 26 February 1998/Accepted 4 August 1998 The observation that human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) can induce CD4 gene transcription and expression in CD4~ cells was reported several years ago ( P. Lusso , A .
De Maria , M. Malnati , F. Lori , S. E. DeRocco , M. Baseler , and R. C. Gallo , Nature 349:533-535 , 1991 ) and subsequently confirmed ( P. Lusso , M. S. Malnati , A. Garzino-Demo , R. W. Crowley , E. O .
Long , and R. C. Gallo , Nature 362:458-462 , 1993 ; G. Furlini , M. Vignoli , E. Ramazzotti , M. C. Re , G. Visani , and M. LaPlaca , Blood 87:4737-4745 , 1996 ) .
Our objective was to identify the mechanisms underlying such phenomena .
Using reporter gene constructs driven by the CD4 promoter , we report that HHV-6 can efficiently transactivate such genetic elements .
Activation of the CD4 promoter occurs in the presence of the viral DNA polymerase inhibitor phosphonoformic acid , which limits expression to the immediate-early and early classes of viral genes .
Using deletion mutants and specific CD4 promoter mutants , we identified an ATF/CRE binding site located at nucleotides -67 to -60 upstream of the CD4 gene transcription start site that is important for HHV-6 transactivation .
The ATF/CRE site is also essential for CD4 promoter activation by forskolin , an activator of adenylate cyclase .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and specific antibodies , we showed that CREB-1 binds specifically to the -79 to -52 region of the CD4 promoter .
Last , we have identified two open reading frames ( ORFs ) of HHV-6 , U8S6 and US9 from the immediate-early locus A , that can transactivate the CD4 promoter in HeLa cells .
However , transactivation of the CD4 promoter by ORFs U86 and U89 is independent of the CRE element , suggesting that additional HHV-6 ORFs are likely to contribute to CD4 gene activation .
Taken together , our results will help to understand the complex interactions occurring between HHV-6 and the CD4 promoter and provide additional information regarding the class of transcription factors involved in the control of CD4 gene expression .
The CD4 antigen plays a role in both T-cell development and T-cell antigen recognition ( 24 , 36 , 37 , 46 ) .
CD4 , through interactions with the nonpolymorphic region of the class II antigen of the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) , acts as an adhesion molecule that helps stabilize the complex formed by the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) and MHC class II antigen ( 5 , 7 , 13 , 21 ) .
CD4 can also participate in T-cell activation through transmembrane signaling via the p56 `` ** tyrosine kinase associated with its cytoplasmic tail ( 39 , 43 , 48 , 49 ) .
Control of CD4 gene expression is very complex .
During the ontogeny of T cells , CD4 gene expression is turned on and off , depending on the stage of maturation of the T cell .
A series of genetic elements , including the enhancer ( 4 , 41 , 45 , 52 ) , promoter ( 40 ) , and silencer ( 6 , 42 , 44 ) , are involved in control of the CD4 gene .
The importance of these genetic elements for proper CD4 expression was demonstrated using transgenic animal models ( 4 , 6 , 42 , 44 ) .
In fact , the presence of all regulatory sequences is required for proper tissue expression of the CD4 gene .
Removal of any one of these elements influences either the level of expression or the cell type in which the gene is expressed .
Maturation of double-positive CD4 ~CD8* thymic cells into mature single-positive CD4*CD8~ or CD4~-CD8* peripheral T cells is a consequence of selective downregulation of the CD8 or the CD4 gene , respectively .
Inhibition of CD4 gene expression in mature CD8 T cells occurs at the transcription level through the action of the CD4 silencer ( 42 , 44 ) .

8797 Very few experimental conditions were found to influence CD4 gene activation in mature CD8* T cells .
Treatment of mature CD8* T cells with azacytidine ( 38 ) , with the lectin concanavalin A ( 3 ) , or with TCR agonists ( 9 ) was found to induce cell surface CD4 expression .
Infection of mature CD8 * T cells by human herpesvirus 6 ( HHV-6 ) was also found to induce CD4 expression ( 26 ) .
The ability of HHV-6 to activate the CD4 gene was also demonstrated in natural killer ( NK ) cells ( 28 ) and in the hematopoietic progenitor cell line KG-1 ( 14 ) .
However , the molecular mechanisms leading to the expression of CD4 were never studied .
HHV-6 has been proposed to play a cofactorial role in progression to AIDS .
Several observations prompted this hy-pothesis .
( i ) HHV-6 can infect CD4 * T cells ( 2 , 25 , 27 , 29 , 47 ) and therefore contribute to the decline of such cell popula-tions .
( ii ) HHV-6 can transactivate the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , thereby increasing HIV expression ( 8 , 15 , 19 , 20 , 30 , 35 , 50 ) .
( iii ) HHV-6 is a potent inducer of tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion ( 10 ) , an inflammatory cytokine known to activate HIV expression .
( iv ) HHV-6 can impair immunological functions such as T-cell proliferation ( 11 , 18 ) and interleukin-2 synthesis ( 11 ) .
( v ) HHV-6 can induce CD4 expression , thereby expanding the types of target cells susceptible to HIV infection ( 14 , 26 , 28 ) .
Although the latter is not likely to significantly contribute to disease , as HHV-6-infected cells will eventually die , the mechanisms implicated in CD4 gene activation by HHV-6 are of biological interest and will contribute to our understanding of the genetic control of the CD4 gene .
In the present work , we studied the interactions between HHV-6 and the CD4 promoter and have identified a functional transcription factor binding site belonging to the ATF/ CRE family .
This site is important in HHV-6-mediated trans- 8798 FLAMAND ET AL .
activation of the CD4 promoter .
Furthermore , two genes of HHV-6 ( U86 and U89 ) were found to transactivate the human CD4 promoter .
The results presented provide new information regarding transcription factors interacting with the CD4 promoter and shed light on the mechanisms by which HHV-6 activates CD4 gene expression .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells , culture conditions , and virus production .
HSB-2 cells were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program , and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , Va. ) .
HSB-2 cells were obtained as cultures in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and antibiotics .
Cells were fed once every 4 to 5 days and seeded at a density of 3 X 10° cells/ml .
HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium ( D-MEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and antibiotics .
Cells were passaged once a week .
HHV-6 ( GS strain ) was propagated in HSB-2 cells and purified as described previously ( 10 ) .
Transfection and infection and luciferase determination .
HSB-2 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as previously described ( 12 ) .
After transfection , cells were centrifuged , washed , and infected with HHV-6 ( multiplicity of infection , 0.1 ) for 2 h at 37°C .
Cells were washed to remove unadsorbed virions and resuspended in complete medium .
In experiments involving the drug phosphonoformic acid ( PFA ) , cells were incubated for 1 h with 100 ug of PFA/ml prior to infection with HHV-6 and kept throughout the experiment .
After 48 h , cells were harvested , washed , and lysed in 150 pl of cell culture lysis buffer ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) .
Twenty microliters of extracts was added to 100 pl of luciferase assay reagents ( Promega ) , and activity was determined by using a T20/20 luminometer ( Turner Design , Calif. ) .
For cotransfection studies , HeLa cells were transfected by the lipofectamine reagent ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , N.Y. ) .
Cells were plated 1 day prior to transfection at 2 X 10°/well in a 6-well plate .
DNA ( 0.75 pg of reporter plasmids and 0.75 ug of effector plasmids ) was mixed and incubated with 6 pl of lipofectamine reagent before being added to HeLa cells .
After 5 h , complete D-MEM was added to the wells .
Forty-cight hours posttransfection the medium was removed and cells were washed and lysed in cell culture lysis buffer .
Luciferase activity in cach sample was determined as described above .
In some experiments , HeLa cells were transfected with reporter plasmids and were treated the next day with forskolin ( 10 wM ) ( Sigma ) or the control diluent dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) .
After an additional 24 h , cells were harvested and luciferase activity was determined .
Flow cytometry .
HSB-2 cells were infected with HHV-6 until signs of infection ( ballooning ) were observed ( 4 to 7 days ) by photonic microscopy .
Cells were harvested , washed , and resuspended in 100 pl of phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 0.1 % FBS .
Phycoerythrin ( PE ) -labeled anti-human CD4 ( Pharmingen ) or PE-labeled isotype-matched control antibodies were added to the infected and uninfected cells for 1 h at 4°C .
Cells were washed twice with 15 ml of cold PBS and fixed in PBS containing 1 % paraformaldehyde .
In parallel , HHV-6 infection was determined by using monoclonal antibody OHV-1 against gp106 of HHV-6 ( Advanced Biotechnologies Inc. , Columbia , Md . )
and fluores-cein-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibodies .
Percentages of cells expressing CD4 and HHV-6 were determined with a FACScalibur flow cytom-eter ( Becton-Dickinson , Mountain View , Calif. ) after the acquisition of 10,000 events .
Cloning of the CD4 promoter and generation of reporter gene constructs .
The human CD4 promoter was cloned using a PCR approach .
From the published sequence ( 40 ) ( GenBank accession no .
UO1066 ) two primers were synthesized ( sense , and antisense , 5'-TTCCTTCTGCAGAGTCGTGCT-3 ' ) and used to amplify an 1,100-bp fragment of Jurkat cell genomic DNA using Pfz DNA polymerase ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif. ) .
The blunt-ended PCR fragment was treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ligated into the Smel site of the pGL3basic vector ( Promega ) to generate the -1076CD4p construct .
The presence and orientation of the insert were determined by restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing .
Generation of 5° deletion mutants of the CD4 promoter .
To generate 5 ' deletion mutants of the CD4 promoter , the -1076CD4p plasmid was digested with Nsil and KpnI and electrophoresed through a 1 % agarose gel .
The 5.4-kb band was isolated using a QIAEX extraction kit ( QIAGEN , San Diego , Calif. ) and treated with S1 nuclease to remove the 3 ' protruding ends .
The plasmid was then treated with Klenow enzyme ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , Ind . )
, extracted with phenol , precipitated , and ligated using the fast ligation kit from Bochringer Mannheim .
Ligated plasmids were used to transformed Escherichia coli DHSa cells , and recombinant clones were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing .
This construct was named -618CD4p .
To generate -333CD4p , the -1076CD4p construct was digested with Apel and KpnI and the 5.1-kb band was isolated and purified as described above .
The plasmid was treated with S1 nuclease , Klenow enzyme , and self ligated .
Bacteria were transformed , and recombinants were identified as described above .
The -71CD4p construct was generated by digesting -1076CD4p with NkeI and Pvull .

To generate the A-71-44CD4p mutant , the -1076CD4p construct was digested with Pvull and BinL .
The 5.9-kb band was purified by gel electrophoresis , treated with Klenow , and self ligated .
After bacterial transformation , clones were isolated and the internal deletion mutant was identified by restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing .
Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative ATF/CRE site of the CD4 promoter was performed using the Chameleon mutagenesis kit , following the manufacturer 's technical guidelines ( Stratagene ) .
Both the -1076CD4p and the -71CD4p constructs were mutated to generate -1076M5CD4p and -71M5CD4p .
The mutation changed the ATF/CRE site ( TGACGT ) to a Drel site ( TTTAAA ) .
Mutation was confirmed by digestion with DreI and sequencing of the region of interest .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Nuclear extracts from uninfected and HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells ( 10° ) were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al .
( 5a ) .
The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for CD4-CRE binding studies were : ( sense ) 5'-AGCTCCAGCTGGTGACGTTITGGGGCCG G-3 ' and ( antisense ) 5'-CCGGCCCCAAACGTCACCAGCTGGAGCT-3 ' , which correspond to the -79 to -52 region of the CD4 promoter .
The double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the consensus CRE binding site ( sense , 5-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3 ' ) and the mutant CRE binding site ( sense , 5-AGAGATTGCCTGTGGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3 ' ) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , Calif. ) .
One hundred nanograms of the CD4-CRE probe was end labeled with [ P ] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , Mass . )
and purified over a spin column ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Gel shift reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 pl as follows : 8 g of nuclear extracts was preincubated for 5 min at room temperature with 2 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Boehringer Mannheim ) in a binding buffer containing 20 % glycerol , 5 mM MgCl , , 2.5 mM EDTA , 2.5 mM dithiothreitol , 250 mM NaCl , and 50 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.5 ) .
Subsequently , 0.1 ng ( 5 X 10 % cpm ) of the labeled probe was added to the mixture and incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature .
The complexes were resolved on a 4 % nondenaturing acrylamide gel containing 2 % glycerol and 0.5 % TBE ( 45 mM Tris [ pH 8.3 ] , 45 mM boric acid , 1 mM EDTA ) at room temperature for 2.5 h at 110 V. Competition experiments were performed by supplementing the reaction mixture with 20 ng ( ~200-fold molar excess ) of unlabeled competitor probe .
For the supershift experiments , nuclear extracts were preincubated for 1 h at 4°C in the presence of 2 mg of the indicated antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotech-nology ) , poly ( dI-dC ) , and binding buffer .
Subsequently , the labeled CD4-CRE probe was added , and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min before separation on gel .
Western blot .
HSB-2 or HSB-2 cells infected with HHV-6 ( multiplicity of infection , 0.1 ) for either 48 or 72 h were lysed in Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer .
Proteins ( 2 X 10° cell equivalent ) were separated by electrophoresis through an SDS-10 % acrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene diflu-oride membranes .
Blots were probe for cither total CREB using rabbit anti-CREB antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) or for the phosphorylated form of CREB ( P-CREB ) using specific antibodies ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , N.Y. ) .
Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were used as secondary antibodies for the detection of proteins made by chemiluminescence .
Quantification of CREB and P-CREB protein levels was performed by laser densitometry analysis .
Immediate-early genes of HHV-6 .
Plasmids containing open reading frames ( ORFs ) 16/17 ( pIEGP2-3 ' ) and ORFs 18/19 ( pIEG1-2 ) ( 35 ) from the IE-B region and a plasmid containing ORF 86 ( pHV6U86 ) ( 34 ) from the IE-A region were generously provided by John Nicholas .
pHV6U86 was generated by PCR using the following primer pair : sense , 5'-GAAGGACTCGTCTCCGG-3 ' ( genome coordinates , 125787 to 125771 ) , and antisense , 5'-GGGTGCTATCACA TCAG-3 ' ( genome coordinates , 130936 to 130920 ) .
The 5.1-kbp fragment which contains the entire U86 ORF was cloned into the pSK+ pBluescript vector .

RESULTS Induction of cell surface CD4 expression in HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells .
Previous reports have shown that infection of mature CD8 * T cells ( 26 ) , NK cells ( 28 ) , and hematopoietic cells ( 14 ) by HHV-6 leads to CD4 gene expression .
Confirmation of these results has now been extended to the immature , voL .

Cell surface expression of CD4 after infection of HSB-2 cells with HHV-6 .
HSB-2 cells ( CD4~ ) were either treated with mock-infected culture fluid or infected with HHV-6 ( GS strain ) .
When signs of cytopathic effect were observed ( 5 to 7 days ) , cells were analyzed for CD4 surface expression by flow cytometry using PE-labeled anti-CD4 or isotype-matched control antibody .
Top panels represent uninfected cells , while bottom panels depict HHV-6-infected cells .
CD4~ T-cell line HSB-2 .
Ten percent of 7-day-old productively HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells were found to express CD4 antigen at the cell surface ( Fig .
1 ) .
This is in contrast to results for uninfected cells for which less than 0.1 % of cells were found positive , by flow cytometry , for CD4 expression .
Approximately 30 % of HSB-2 cells were infected with HHV-6 as determined by immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for HHV-6 gp106 protein ( not shown ) .
Activation of the CD4 promoter by HHV-6 .
CD4 gene regulation is regulated in a very complex manner .
Several genetic elements , such as distal and proximal enhancers , a silencer , and a promoter , are known to play a role in the control of in vivo CD4 gene expression .
Our present work focuses mainly on the interactions between HHV-6 and the CD4 promoter .
To study the effects of HHV-6 on CD4 promoter activity , we cloned , upstream of a luciferase reporter gene , the 1,076-bp CD4 promoter in the promoterless pGL3basic vector to create the -1076CD4p plasmid .
HSB-2 cells were transfected in duplicate either with the pGL3basic vector or with the full-length CD4 promoter and subsequently infected with HHV-6 .
Two days after infection , luciferase activity was monitored .
As shown in Fig .
2A , HHV-6 can minimally activate the pGL3basic vector .
However , HHV-6 was able to strongly transactivate the full-length CD4 promoter with greater than a 10-fold increase in activity when compared to that of the pGL3basic vector .

( A ) Activation of the CD4 promoter by HHV-6 .
HSB-2 cells were transfected with control ( pGL3 ) or with -1076CD4p constructs and infected with HHV-6 or treated with mock-infected culture supernatant .
PFA was added 1 h prior to infection , and PFA was kept throughout the experiment .
Cells were harvested and lysed at 48 h postinfection , and luciferase activity was determined .
Results ( mean + standard deviation ) , expressed as relative luciferase activity , are calculated from triplicate cultures and are representative of three experiments .
( B ) Kinetics of CD4 promoter activation by HHV-6 .
HSB-2 cells were transfected with the -1076CD4p construct and treated , the next day , with cither mock-infected fluid or with HHV-6 .
At various times after infection , cell were harvested and lysed and luciferase activity was determined .
Results ( mean + standard deviation ) are calculated from triplicate cultures and are representative of three experiments .
It has been reported previously that HHV-6 can induce cell surface CD4 expression in the presence of the viral DNA polymerase inhibitor , ( 26 ) .
To test whether HHV-6 can activate the CD4 promoter in the presence of PFA , HSB-2 cells were transfected with the full-length CD4 promoter plasmid and infected with HHV-6 in the presence of PFA .
Results ( Fig .
2A ) indicate that luciferase activity in the PFA-treated group was similar to that of the untreated , HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells , suggesting that an immediate-early or early gene ( s ) of HHV-6 is sufficient for CD4 promoter transactivation .
Effectiveness of PFA treatment was confirmed by the absence of HHV-6 glycoprotein B expression , a late viral gene product ( data not shown ) .
Kinetics of CD4 promoter activation by HHV-6 .
In the next series of experiments , we performed kinetic analyses of CD4 promoter activation by HHV-6 .
HSB-2 cells were transfected with the full-length CD4 promoter and infected with HHV-6 on the next day .
At various times after infection , cells were lysed and luciferase activity was determined .

The MS mutation , which changes the putative ATF/CRE site ( under-lined ) of the wild-type sequence to TTTAAATT ( double underline ) , is shown at the bottom of the panel .
( B ) Identification of a minimal CD4 promoter responsive to HHV-6 .
HSB-2 cells were transfected with a series of mutants of the CD4 promoter and subsequently infected with HHV-6 or treated with mock-infected culture supernatant ( mock ) .
Forty-eight hours postinfection , cells were harvested and lysed and luciferase activity was determined .
Results , from triplicate cultures , are representative of five experiments and are expressed as fold increase in luciferase activity after normalization with values from uninfected , transfected HSB-2 cells .
2B , there is no promoter activity during the first 8 h postinfec-tion .
However , at both 24 and 48 h postinfection , a strong increase in luciferase activity was detected .
The fact that no activity was recorded during the initial phases of infection ( 2 to 8 h ) suggests that CD4 promoter activation by HHV-6 is not simply the consequence of receptor-mediated transcriptional activation .
In support of such hypothesis is the fact that UV-irradiated HHV-6 , which allows binding of the virus to its receptor but prevents transcription of viral genes , failed to transactivate the CD4 promoter ( data not shown ) .
Identification of a minimal CD4 promoter responsive to HHV-6 .
As represented in Fig .
3A , eight different CD4 promoter constructs were generated .
These range from a full-length CD4 promoter ( -1076CD4p ) to a CD4 promoter containing only 44 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site ( -44CD4p ) .
Also included is an internal deletion construct ( A-71-44CD4p ) and site-directed mutant promoters ( -1076M5CD4p and =-71M5CD4p ) .
We have shown in the first series of experiments ( Fig .
2 ) that J. ViRoL .
the CD4 promoter can be efficiently transactivated by HHV-6 .
To better identify which region ( s ) of the promoter is responsive to HHV-6 , we tested a series of 5 ' deletion mutants of the CD4 promoter .
These constructs were independently transfected into HSB-2 cells , followed by infection with HHV-6 .
All constructs showed similar activity under basal conditions , i.e .
, in the absence of HHV-6 .
The -1076CD4p , -618CD4p , -333CD4p , and -71CD4p constructs were equally responsive to HHV-6 infection , as evidenced by the fold induction in luciferase activity ( Fig .
3B ) .
However , the removal of an additional 27 nucleotides from the -71CD4p plasmid , to create the -44CD4p plasmid , was found to significantly impair the ability of HHV-6 to activate the CD4 promoter .
Indeed , a greater than fourfold decrease in luciferase activity is recorded with the -44CD4p plasmid compared to that of the -71CD4p vector .
Identification of a ATF/CRE site important for transactivation by HHV-6 .
The region located between -71 and -44 of the CD4 promoter is important for HHV-6-mediated transactivation ( Fig .
3B ) .
To determine whether other cis-acting elements play a role in HHV-6 transactivation of the CD4 promoter , we generated a construct in which the region from -71 to -44 was deleted , leaving the rest of the promoter intact ( construct A-71-44CD4p , Fig .
3A ) .
This construct was transfected in HSB-2 cells and tested for HHV-6 responsiveness .
As shown in Fig .
3B , the A-71-44CD4p construct responded to HHV-6 with a reduced transactivation ability , as was the case with the -44CD4p construct .
These results suggest that DNA sequences located elsewhere than within the -71 to -44 region do not play a role in the ability of HHV-6 to transactivate the CD4 promoter .
Computer analysis of the -71 to -44 region reveals the presence of a putative ATF/CRE binding site .
The region from -67 to -62 contains the sequence TGA CGT , which is identical to six of the eight nucleotides from a consensus ATF/CRE site ( TGACGTCA ) .
To determine whether this site is of importance for HHV-6 transactivation , we mutated the TGACGT site to TTTAAA ( Fig .
3A ) .
Mutation of this site was performed in both the wild-type CD4 promoter ( -1076M5CD4p ) and in the minimal -=71CD4p ( -71M5CD4p ) construct .
Mutated plasmids were transfected in parallel with the wild-type constructs and tested for responsiveness to HHV-6 .
The results ( Fig .
3B ) indicate that mutation of the putative ATF/CRE site of the CD4 promoter is detrimental for HHV-6 transactivation .
In fact , the levels of activation are similar to those obtained with the constructs lacking the ATF/CRE site ( -44CD4p and A-71-44CD4p ) ( Fig .
3B ) .
Binding of transcription factors to the putative ATF/CRE sites of the CD4 promoter .
We demonstrated that the putative ATF/CRE site , located between -71 and -44 of the CD4 promoter is important for transactivation by HHV-6 .
Thus , we studied the binding of transcription factors to the -79 to -52 region of the CD4 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Nuclear extracts from both uninfected and HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells were obtained and used in binding assays .
As shown in Fig .
4A , extracts from both sources efficiently bind the CD4 oligonucleotide , with no apparent differences in the intensity or pattern of binding .
In addition , homologous competition with unlabeled CD4 oligonucleotide was very efficient .
Equally efficient was a competition between the CD4 oligonucleotide and an oligonucleotide containing a wild-type CRE site .
However , no competition could be observed with an oligonucleotide having a mutated CRE ( M-CRE ) consensus se-quence .
In an effort to better characterize the protein complex binding to the CD4 oligonucleotide , we proceeded to perform voL .

( A ) Binding of transcription factors to the ATF/CRE site of the CD4 promoter .
Nuclear extracts from uninfected and HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells were obtained and subjected to gel-shift assays , using the *°P-labeled probe spanning the -79 to -52 region of the CD4 promoter .
Competition with a 200-fold excess of cold CD4 probe , wild-type ATF/CRE , and mutated ATF/CRE sequence was performed .
Incubation of extracts with antibodies reacting with various transcription factors was also included .
Results are representative of two experiments .
( B ) Activation of the CD4 promoter by forskolin .
HeLa cells were transfected with either the pGL3basic , -71CD4p , -44CD4p , or -71M5CD4p construct and treated with DMSO ( mock ) or 10 M forskolin .
After 48 h , cells were harvested and luciferase activity was determined .
Results , obtained from triplicate cultures , are expressed as fold induction of luciferase activity and are representative of three separate experiments .
( C ) Increased CREB phosphorylation in HHV-6-infected cells .
HSB-2 and HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells ( 48 and 72 h postinfection ) were lysed in Laemmli buffer and analyzed for total CREB and P-CREB by Western blot using specific antibodies .
Ratios of P-CREB/ CREB were calculated for each sample following densitometric analysis of au-toradiograms and normalization against CREB and P-CREB values of the mock-infected sample .
Results are representative of two independent experiments .
CD4 PROMOTER ACTIVATION BY HHV-6 - 8801 supershift experiments using commercially available antibodies that react against known transcription factors .
We first selected antibodies that were cross-reactive against several proteins known to bind DNA sequences having homologies to the putative ATF/CRE site found within the CD4 oligonucleotide .
The antibodies used were capable of binding CREB-1/ATF-1/ CREM-1 , CREB-2/ATF-4 , c-Jun/AP-1/JunB/JunD , and Ets-1/ Ets-2 as negative controls .
When used in the binding reactions , only the antibodies reacting with CREB-1/ATF-1/CREM-1 caused a supershift of the complex ( data not shown ) .
With the use of monospecific antibodies against CREB-1 , we positively identified the CREB-1 protein as one of the factors binding to the ATF/CRE site of the CD4 promoter , as witnessed by reduced mobility ( supershift ) of the protein complex ( Fig .
4A ) .
Antibodies to CREB-2 were used as negative controls .
Antibodies against CREM-1 were also unreactive ( data not shown ) .
Activation of the CD4 promoter by forskolin .
Transcriptional activation via ATF/CRE sites is often regulated through the action of protein kinase A ( PKA ) which phosphorylates and thereby activates transcription factors such as CREB ( 17 , 22 ) .
Since PKA activity is influenced by levels of intracellular cAMP ( cAMP ; ) , we tested whether an agonist such as forskolin , which causes an increase in cAMP , , can activate the CD4 promoter .
Transfected HeLa cells were stimulated with forskolin , and luciferase activity was determined .
Results ( Fig .
4B ) indicate that the promoterless pGL3basic and -44CD4p constructs were not activated by DMSO ( solvent ) or by forskolin .
However , the -71CD4p construct , which contains the ATF/ CRE sequence , is efficiently activated by forskolin ( fivefold ) .
Treatment of cells with DMSO ( mock ) had no effect on promoter activity .
The -71M5CD4p construct which contains a mutated ATF/CRE consensus site was not responsive to forskolin activation .
These results suggest that the transcriptional activity of factors binding to the ATF/CRE site within the CD4 promoter can be regulated , at least in part , by cAMP and PKA .
Analysis of CREB and phosphorylated CREB in HHV-6-infected cells .
Knowing that there is no difference in the binding pattern or in the amount of proteins bound to the -79 to -52 region of the CD4 promoter we studied , by Western blot , the levels of prosphorylated CREB ( P-CREB ) in extracts of HSB-2 and HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells .
Forty-eight and 72 h after infection the cells were harvested and lysed in SDS-PAGE buffer and proteins from 2 X 10° cell equivalents were separated by gel electrophoresis .
After transfer onto a mem-brane , blots were probed with either anti-CREB or anti-P-CREB antibodies .
Results indicate ( Fig .
4C ) that levels of P-CREB in the infected samples are twofold higher than those in the mock-infected cells when compared to the levels of unphosphorylated CREB .
P-CREB levels of expression in HHV-6-infected cells were calculated after normalization against CREB and P-CREB levels of expression in the mock-infected samples .
Identification of HHV-6 ORFs 86 and 89 as CD4 promoter transactivators .
From our kinetics data and the results obtained using the drug PFA , we deduced that virally encoded proteins belonging to the immediate-early or early class of protein were involved in CD4 promoter activation .
In an effort to identify such proteins , we tested constructs containing ORFs from both the IE-A and IE-B regions of HHV-6 .
The plasmids contained U16/17 and U18/19 from the IE-B region and U86 and US $ from the IE-A region .
In addition , a plasmid containing the transactivator U25 ( 35 ) was also tested .
These plasmids were independently cotransfected into HeLa cells with the -71CD4p construct .
HeLa cells were chosen for their much higher efficiency of transfection ( 15 to 20 % as determined by flow cytometry following transfection with pGreen Lantern 8802 FLAMAND ET AL .

HeLa cells were cotransfected with either the control vector ( peDNA3.1 ) or with plasmids encoding HHV-6 genes ( 0.75 ug each ) along with the -71CD4p ( 0.75 g ) construct .

The expression vector peDNA3.1 was used as a negative control .
Forty-eight hours posttransfection , cells were lysed and luciferase activity was determined .
As shown in Fig .
5A , cells transfected with U16/ U17 , U18/U19 , or the peDNA3.1 control vector showed comparable low levels of luciferase activity .
The plasmid containing U25 showed limited transactivation , with a 2.5-fold increase in reporter activity .
Interestingly , the U86 and U89 constructs were capable of transactivating the -71CD4p promoter construct significantly , with a seven- to ninefold increase in activity .
To determine whether the U8S6 and U89 transactivators were dependent on the presence of the ATF/CRE site to mediate their effects , we carried out similar experiments using the -71M5CD4p construct as the reporter plasmid .
As shown in Fig .
5B , the U86 and U8S9 constructs were equally efficient in transactivating both the -71CD4p and the -71M5CD4p plas-mids , suggesting an ATF/CRE-independent mode of action .

DISCUSSION T-cell precursors migrating out of the bone marrow and arriving in the thymus express low levels of CD4 ( CD4®CD8~ ) ( 51 ) .
These cells eventually lose CD4 expression and are referred to as double-negative ( CD4 CD8 ) thymocytes .
During subsequent maturation steps , the CD4 , CD8 , and TCR genes are upregulated , forming a population of double-positive ( CD4*CD8+* ) cells .
Last , following positive and/or negative selection , survivor cells lose expression of CD4 or CD8 , leading to a mature CD4 *~CD8~ or CD4~-CD8* T-cell phenotype as seen in the peripheral blood .
Regulation of the CD4 gene is very complex and relies on the participation of several cis-acting elements , such as promoter , enhancer , and silencer .
The original description of the human CD4 promoter indicates a lack of both TATA and CAAT boxes , no defined initiator sequence , and few transcription factor binding sites ( 40 ) .
Binding sites for and physical binding of Ets and Myb transcription factors to the CD4 promoter have been observed ( 40 , 45 ) .
A minimal human CD4 promoter ( nucleotides located at -40 to +16 relative to the transcription start site ) with reduced activity compared to that of the full-length promoter was identified ( 40 ) .
These results suggested that additional cis-acting elements upstream of this minimal promoter are needed for full activity .
We began to study the human CD4 promoter during an attempt to identify the mechanisms by which HHV-6 induces CD4 gene expression in CD4~ cells , such as mature CD8 * T cells , NK cells , and a hematopoietic progenitor cell line .
In general , once a CD8 * T cell has reached maturity , it never expresses the CD4 antigen .
In such cells , CD4 gene transcription is shut off through the action of the CD4 silencer located within the first intron of the CD4 gene ( 42 , 44 ) .
The mode of action of the silencer is not completely understood .
The silencer is not , however , the only element capable of exerting a negative regulatory action on the CD4 promoter .
If such was the case , the CD4 promoter , in the absence of silencer se-quences , would be active in many cell types .
On the contrary , it has been reported that both the human and mouse CD4 promoters are highly active in CD4* cells and much less in CD4~ cells ( 40 , 45 ) , suggesting that the CD4 promoter is tissue specific .
One hypothesis is that promoter activity in various cell types may be influenced by the presence or absence of key transcription factors needed to fully activate the promoter .
When the effects of HHV-6 infection on CD4 promoter activity were tested , we noticed that this virus can very efficiently transactivate the CD4 promoter .
CD4 promoter activation in HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells ( a CD4_ immature T-cell line ) was paralleled by cell surface induction of the CD4 antigen .
The fact that , at any given time , we do not detect more than 10 to 15 % of HSB-2 cells expressing surface CD4 , although more than 30 % are infected with HHV-6 as determined by immunofluorescence assay , suggests that CD4 induction may not be permanent .
This is most likely the result of asynchronous lytic replication and cytopathic effects .
Using 5 ' deletion mutants of the CD4 promoter , we have identified a minimal promoter ( from -71 to +21 ) responsive to HHV-6 .
This result suggests that cis elements upstream of this region are not involved in HHV-6 activation of the CD4 promoter .
Removal of an additional 27 nucleotides greatly affected the ability of HHV-6 to activate the CD4 promoter .
Analysis of the region from -71 to -44 revealed a partial ATF/CRE site ( TGACGTTT ) homologous to six of the eight nucleotides of voL .
72 , 1998 the wild-type consensus sequence ( TGACGTCA ) .
Mutation of the ATF/CRE site of the CD4 promoter to TTTAAATT or deletion of the -71 -44 region from the full-length promoter was also found to impair the ability of HHV-6 to transactivate the CD4 promoter .
ATF/CRE sites are present and are involved in the regulation of many cellular and viral promoters .
Interestingly , the HHV-6 DNA polymerase promoter contains a single ATF/ CRE site located at the -70 region that is critical for promoter activity ( 1 ) .
Removal or mutation of the ATF/CRE site eliminated the ability of HHV-6 to activate its own polymerase promoter ( 1 ) .
Furthermore , HHV-6 was shown to transactivate the Epstein-Barr virus Zebra promoter through a single ATF/CRE site ( TGACATCA ) located in the -67 to -60 region ( 12 ) .
The ATF/CRE site can bind numerous transcription factors belonging to the bZIP leucine zipper family of proteins , including ATF/CREB/CREM , Fos/Jun , and C/EBP ( 31 ) .
Our results , and those of Agulnik et al .
( 1 ) and Flamand and Menezes ( 12 ) , indicate that constitutively expressed proteins bind to the ATF/CRE sites .
To better characterize the interaction between HHV-6 and the CD4 promoter , we studied , using gel shift assays , the binding patterns of proteins from uninfected and HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells .
No difference in binding intensities or binding patterns between extracts from uninfected and HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells could be de-tected , suggesting that viral transactivators do not bind DNA directly or that they are too limited in amount for detection .
In order to identify protein ( s ) bound to the ATF/CRE site of the CD4 promoter within cell extracts , we made use of antibodies directed against several transcription factors known for their binding to ATF/CRE sites .
Only one of these antibodies was found to be reactive for the complex bound to the CD4 promoter , identifying at least one of the factors binding to the ATF/CRE site as CREB-1 .
These results were further confirmed by using recombinant CREB-1 protein , which could efficiently bind to the ATF/CRE site within the CD4 promoter ( data not shown ) .
Viral transactivators may interact with basal transcription units and adjacent transcription factors , bridging them together to allow efficient transcription to occur .
In addition , some of the factors binding to the ATF/CRE site , such as CREB , efficiently bind DNA but are transcriptionally inactive until they become phosphorylated ( 17 , 22 ) .
To help explain efficient CD4 promoter transactivation in the presence of constant levels of CREB-1 protein , we studied the levels of active CREB , i.e .
, phosphorylated CREB-1 in extracts from uninfected and HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells .
Using specific monoclonal antibodies , we were able to show increased levels of the phosphorylated form of CREB in HHV-6-infected cell extracts when compared to those of uninfected HSB-2 cells .
Viral transactivators may therefore directly , or indirectly through activation of cellular kinases , promote transcription through the phosphorylation of key regulatory transcription factors .
Kinetics analyses suggest that direct transduction of signals resulting from the interactions of HHV-6 with its cellular re-ceptor ( s ) is not responsible for CD4 promoter activation .
More than 8 h of infection were needed for CD4 promoter activa-tion , indicating , in all likelihood , that cellular and/or viral proteins outside the signaling cascade are needed .
Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that UV-irradiated HHV-6 , which can still bind to cells but can not transcribe any of its genes , does not activate the CD4 promoter .
To better characterize the gene ( s ) of HHV-6 involved in CD4 promoter acti-vation , we made use of the drug PFA which restricts gene expression of the immediate-early and early classes of genes .
The fact that PFA treatment of cells had no effect on the ability CD4 PROMOTER ACTIVATION BY HHV-6 - 8803 of HHV-6 to activate the CD4 promoter suggested that immediate-early or early genes were involved in promoter activation .
The HHV-6 genome , which is essentially collinear with that of human cytomegalovirus ( HMCV ) ( 16 , 23 , 32 ) , contains a long ( 141 kbp ) unique coding region flanked by two directly repeated terminal sequences of approximately 8 kbp each ( 16 ) .
Within the unique segment , two loci encoding potential immediate-early genes have been identified .
ORFs 16 to 19 of the immediate-early region B are homologous to UL36 to UL38 of HCMV ( 16 , 35 ) .
Although these gene segments were found capable of transactivating the HIV LTR ( 35 ) none of these ORFs was able to transactivate the CD4 promoter .
Region A , the second HHV-6 immediate-early locus contains U86 and U89 , which are positional homologs of HCMV IE2 and IE1 , respectively .
In cotransfection experiments , U89 was shown capable of transactivating the HIV LTR ( 30 ) .
When we tested U86 and U89 , both of these genes were found to be capable of activating the CD4 promoter .
U86 has the capacity to code for a 152-kDa protein whose carboxy-terminal half has homology with IE2 ( UL122 ) of HCMV ( 16 ) .
U89 does not share sequence homology with any HCMV proteins although a homologous gene is observed in the more closely related HHV-7 ( 33 ) .
U89 was capable of transactivating several promoters , including those having ATF sites such as the E4 early promoter of adenovirus ( 30 ) .
However , as is the case for the CD4 promoter , transactivation of the E4 promoter by U89 is independent of the ATF/CRE consensus sequence ( 30 ) .
Furthermore , transactivation of the HIV LTR by U8S9 of HHV-6 was found to be impaired if the NFB , TATA box , or SP1 site was mutated ( 30 ) .
This suggests that U89 and perhaps U86 act as transcriptional enhancers through activation or recruitment of transcriptional unit complexes .
The fact that multiple distinct transcription factor binding sites can be activated by U89 supports the hypothesis that this protein does not bind a specific DNA consensus sequence but rather interacts with regulatory proteins common to many transcriptional units .
HHV-6 has been associated with the transactivation of several viral promoters , including those Epstein-Barr virus ( 12 ) and HIV ( 8 , 15 , 19 , 50 ) .
The present study indicates that HHV-6 can also efficiently transactivate the human CD4 promoter .
A previously unrecognized ATF/CRE site within the CD4 promoter , capable of binding CREB-1 , is important for promoter transactivation by HHV-6 .
Whether CD4 gene activation and de novo CD4 protein expression play a role in HHV-6 or HIV pathogenesis is unclear .
CD4 gene activation could simply be a consequence of HHV-6 immediate-early and/or early gene expression .
In fact , the promiscuity of CRE elements in viral and cellular promoters may lead to the activation of several genes sharing such common regulatory elements .
The HHV-6 TATA-less DNA polymerase promoter is mainly controlled by a CRE element ( 1 ) , suggesting that for efficient replication HHV-6 must have evolved mechanisms capable of activating transcription factors , such as CREB , involved in CRE-mediated promoter activation .
Overall , our results provide a better understanding of HHV-6 's biology and give new insights into the regulation of the human CD4 promoter .
