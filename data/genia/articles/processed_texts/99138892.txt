6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; Fas Ligand Induction in Human NK Cells Is Regulated by Redox Through a Calcineurin-Nuclear Factors of Activated T Cell-Dependent Pathway Keizo Furuke , Mitsuhiro Shiraishi , Howard S. Mostowski , and Eda T. Bloom Fas ligand ( FasL ) on cytotoxic lymphocytes is important for mediating apoptosis of activated lymphocytes and other target cells .
We have reported that NK cell functions , such as proliferation , cell death , and killing activity , are subject to regulation by cellular redox status .
Here , we report that expression of FasL protein and mRNA in activated NK cells is also regulated by redox .
Ligation of CD16 on IL-2-preactivated NK cells resulted in reduction of intracellular peroxide level as well as induction of FasL expression .
This CD16-induced FasL expression was suppressed by oxidative stress , including thiol deprivation or treatment with hydrogen peroxide ( H,0 , ) .
Addition of thiol-reducing compounds , such as L-cystine , 2-ME , or N-acetyl cysteine , restored FasL expression .
These data suggest that CD16 stimulation requires cellular reducing status for FasL induction in NK cells .
Because FasL gene activation following CD16 cross-linking is regulated by the NF of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , we examined the effect of oxidative stresses on NFAT activation .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that both thiol insufficiency and H , O , treatment suppressed DNA-binding activity of NFAT and that addition of thiol-reducing compounds reversed or even enhanced it .
Furthermore , these oxidative stresses inhibited activity of calcineurin , a serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates NFAT activation .
These results suggest that suppression of calcineurin and NFAT activation is a mechanism by which oxidative stress inhibits FasL induction in activated NK cells and further support the hypothesis that thiol-reducing compounds might be required for main tenance of optimal NK functions under physiologic oxidative conditions .
death signal in a variety of cell types upon binding with its natural ligand , Fas ligand ( FasL ) , or cross-linking with anti-Fas IgM mAb ( 1 , 2 ) .
CTL and NK cells are known to express FasL during activation and exert granule-independent cytotoxicity via Fas/FasL interaction ( 1 , 2 ) .
In addition , growing evidence shows that cytotoxic lymphocytes treated with anti-CD3 mAb for T cells undergo apoptosis following homotypic interaction through Fas and FasL ( 3-5 ) .
NK cells activated with cytokines such as IL-2 exhibit induction of FasL and increased levels of Fas on their cell surface and undergo apoptosis by homotypic interaction upon cross-linking of €D16 ( FeyRIHN ) ( 6 ) .
Thus , the Fas/FasL system is also considered to play a role for the control of activated cell populations in the immune system .
A number of signaling events mediating FasL gene activation have been investigated .
ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase and €D45 tyrosine phosphatase have been reported to be required for TCR-mediated FasL induction in T cells ( 7 , 8 ) .
Induction of FasL expression is suppressed by cyclosporin A ( CsA ) ( 9 ) , glucocorticoid hormone , I T as ( APO-1/CD95 ) is a surface receptor that transduces a Laboratory of Cellular Immunology , Division of Cellular and Gene Therapies , Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research , Food and Drug Administration , Bethesda , MD 20892 Received for publication July 21 , 1998 .

Transcription factors , such as NF of activated T cells ( NFAT ) and NF-KB , have been reported to be involved in FasL expression in activated T cells ( 8 , 11 , 12 ) .
Although both tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of transcriptional factors are known to be subject to regulation by cellular redox status ( 13 , 14 ) , it is not known whether cellular redox is involved in regulating FasL expression .
We have shown that NK cells cultured in thiol-deficient condi-tions , which produces decreased levels of reduced glutathione , are unable to respond to IL-2 with increased proliferation and cytotoxicity ( 15 , 16 ) and that thiol deprivation also facilitates Fas-mediated cell death in NK cells ( 17 ) .
These findings prompted us to examine the effect of cellular redox status on FasL induction in NK cells treated with IL-2 and/or anti-CD16 mAb and to further identify an underlying mechanism .

Cell suspensions were centrifuged over 47.5 % Per-coll to obtain low-density large granular cells .
NK-enriched mononuclear cells were further treated with anti-CD5 , anti-CD22 , and anti-CD36 mAbs at 4°C for 2-4 h , incubated with GaM-coated magnet beads ( PerSeptive Biosystems , Framingham , MA ) at 4°C for 30 min and exposed to a magnetic field to eliminate residual T cells , B cells , and monocytes .
The purity of NK cells ( CD16 * and/or CD56 * ) in each experiment was always 85-95 % as assessed by FACScan ( Becton Dickinson ) } .
The population of contaminating T cells ( CDS56~ , CD3 * ) , B cells ( CD20+* ) , or monocytes/mac-rophages ( CD14* ) in each experiment was < 10 % , < 5 % , or < 5 % , respectively .
Flow cytometric analysis of expression of FasL and intracellular peroxide levels Quantitation of surface FasL expression was assessed by flow cytometric analysis .

Briefly , cells were cultured in medium with 5 uM 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate ( DCFH-DA ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) for 15 min at 37°C following the indicated treatments and harvested for flow cytometry .
In experiments designed to confirm whether NK cells contain intracellular peroxides , cells were stained first with anti-CD56- and anti-CD16-PE mAbs to identify NK cells , or with CD14-PE mAb to identify monocyte/macrophages before assay for peroxides with DCFH-DA .
RT-PCR analysis of FasL and IFN-y mRNA FasL and IFN-y mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR using [ °°P ] dCTP as previously described ( 17 , 20 ) .

Aliquots of each amplification were analyzed by electrophoresis in 5 % acrylamide-Tris-borate gels .
The lanes were normalized to G3PDH mRNA levels as described ( 20 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Schreiber et al .

The reaction was stopped with 2 ul of 0.1 % bromophenol blue , followed by electrophoresis on 5 % polyacryl-amide gels in 0.25 % Tris-buffered EDTA ( pH 8.4 ) under nondenaturing conditions .
An unlabeled cold probe ( 5 ng ) was added at the beginning of the reaction as a competitor .
For supershift , 1 pl of antisera against murine NFAT1 ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) , which cross-reacts with human NFAT1 , was added to nuclear extracts and incubated on ice for 30 min before the binding reaction .
Calcineurin assay Calcineurin activity was assayed as previously described ( 24 ) .
Hypotonic lysates from 10 `` purified NK cells were assessed following the indicated treatments for their ability to dephosphorylate a *°P-serine-labeled 19-amino acid peptide substrate ( Sigma ) in the presence of okadaic acid ( Sig-ma ) , a phosphatase type 1 and 2A inhibitor .

Free inorganic phosphate was isolated using a Dowex cation-exchange resin ( AGSOW-X8 100-200 mesh ; Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) and quanti-tated by scintillation counting .
Variation between duplicates was < 10 % .
The number of picomoles of phosphate released was calculated by using the sp .

The protein content of cell lysates was determined with a Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit , and calcineurin activity was expressed as picomoles of released °°P per minute per milligram of lysate protein .
Results Time course of increase in FasL expression in IL-2-preactivated NK cells by anti-CD16 Ab It has been reported that FasL mRNA can be detected in IL-2-preactivated NK cells within 6 h following treatment with anti-CD16 Ab ( 6 ) .
Therefore , we first examined the time course of cell surface FasL protein expression , as determined by flow cytometry , on IL-2-preactivated NK cells following ligation of CD16 .
NK cells cultured with IL-2 for 3 days expressed FasL only weakly ( mean fluorescent intensity ( MFI ) < 10 ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , however , FasL expression was increased within 6 h and peaked between 6-24 h following addition of anti-CD16 mAb , although time points of the peak FasL expression varied among cells from individual donors .
We confirmed that the fluorescence intensity was specific for FasL using biotin-conjugated mouse IgG1 as a negative control .

The data are representative of experiments using cells from three different donors and demonstrate that the populations of CD56 * and/or CD16* NK cells and CD14* monocyte/ macrophages were both positive for peroxide staining and represent 87 % and 3 % of the cell populations , respectively .
B , Effects of treatment with anti-CD16 mAb or H , O , or culture in CYS ( - ) medium on intracellular peroxide levels in IL-2-preactivated NK cells .
Purified NK cells were cultured in the presence of 100 U/ml of IL-2 in CYS ( + ) medium for 72 h ( labeled as CONTROL ) , cultured in CYS ( + ) medium for 60 h and in CYS ( - ) medium for an additional 12 h ( labeled as CYS ( - ) ) , or cultured in CYS ( + ) medium for 70 h and treated with 10 pg/ml of anti-CD16 plus 10 ug/ml of GaM ( labeled as CD16 ) or with 100 uM H , O ; ( labeled as H ; ,0 , ) in CYS ( + ) medium for an additional 2 h. Intracellular peroxide levels measured by flow cytometry were reduced by anti-CD16 mAb treatment but increased by addition of exogenous H , O ; or thiol deprivation .
A representative of four independent experiments is presented .
cross-linking because anti-€CD56 mAb , an isotype control for anti-CD16 mAb , did not show any alteration in FasL expression .
Ligation of CD16 decreased intracellular peroxide level in IL-2-preactivated NK cells Intracellular peroxide levels are known to reflect the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) ( 25 ) and to be increased under conditions of oxidative stress ( 26 ) .
Therefore , we next measured intracellular peroxide levels as an indicator of whether CD16 ligation affects intracellular redox status in IL-2-preactivated NK cells .
We found that intracellular peroxides could be detected in CD56 * and/or CD16* NK cells , which represented > 85 % of the cell population , and in CD14* monocyte/macrophages , representing only 3 % of the cell population ( Fig .
24 ) .
The amount of intracellular peroxide was strongly reduced following treatment with anti-CD16 mAb ( Fig .
2B ) , although no effect was seen with anti-CD56 mAb of the same isotype as the anti-CD16 mAb ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , either culture in CYS ( - ) medium for 12 h or treatment with 100 mM H , O , for 2 h increased contents of intracellular peroxides in IL-2-preactivated NK cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
These results suggest that ROS production is suppressed or levels are quenched following CD16 cross-linking in NK cells , and that both thiol deprivation and H , O , treatment result in oxidative stress through increasing intracellular ROS levels .

Effects of H , O ; treatment ( A ) or thiol deprivation and addition of thiol reducing compounds ( B ) on CD16-induced FasL expression .
A , IL-2-preactivated NK cells were treated with 10 pg/ml of anti-CD16 plus 10 pg/ml of GaM in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of H , O ; for 12 h. B , IL-2-pretreated NK cells were cultured in CYS ( + ) or CYS ( - ) medium in the presence or absence of 50 uM 2-ME or 10 mM NAC with 10 pg/ml of anti-CD16 or anti-CD56 mAb plus 10 ug/tal of GaM for 12 h. FasL expression determined by flow cytometry was suppressed by oxidative stress , including thiol deprivation or H , O , treatment , and restored by addition of thiol-reducing compounds , such as 1-Cys , 2-ME , or NAC .
Data are MFI + SD from three different donors .
Inhibition of FasL induction in anti-CD16-treated NK cells by H,0 , treatment or by thiol deprivation To evaluate the effects of oxidative stress on FasL expression , we determined the effect of H , O ; treatment on FasL cell surface expression in anti-CD16-treated NK cells .
When IL-2-pretreated NK cells were exposed to 0.1-100 uM H , O , for 12 h , FasL expression induced by anti-CD16 mAb was reduced in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
3A ) .
Cell viability was not significantly affected at the same concentrations of H , O , ( data not shown ) .
To clarify whether cellular redox status plays a role in FasL induction following CD16 cross-linking , we next assessed the effects on FasL induction of manipulating cellular redox status in activated NK cells using thiol deprivation with CYS ( - ) medium or by adding back thiol-reducing compounds .
NK cells were treated with IL-2 in standard medium for 60 h , followed by culture in CYS ( + ) or CYS ( - ) medium in the presence of anti-CD16 or anti-CD56 mAb for an additional 12 h. As shown in Fig .
3B , FasL induction following ligation of CD16 was completely inhibited in CYS ( - ) medium .
No alteration of FasL expression by CYS ( - ) was observed in anti-CD56-treated NK cells ( data not shown ) .
This decrease in FasL expression was completely reversed by addition to CYS ( - ) medium of 200 uM 1-Cys , 50 uM 2-ME , or 10 mM NAC , which are thiol-reducing compounds that we have 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology CD56 + z « s ® & is CD16 - + + + + +o + H20z - - - 10 - 100 _ - - ( uM ) CYS +o o + + + - - E 2-ME _ - - - - - ee NAC _ - - - f s -o ¢ FasL guam maas ume 503 b.p .

CD16-induced FasL mRNA expression was suppressed by thiol deprivation or H , O , treatment and restored by addition of thiol compounds .
In contrast , mRNA encoding for IFN-y was augmented by cross-linking of CD16 , but this level was unaffected by manipulation of redox conditions .
IL-2-preactivated NK cells were cultured in CYS ( + ) or CYS ( - ) medium for 9 h , then treated as indicated ( described in Fig .
3 ) for 3 h. RT-PCR analysis for FasL , IFN-y , or G3PDH mRNA is depicted and is a representative of three independent experiments .

shown to increase intracellular reduced type glutathione in NK cells ( 15 ) ( Fig .
3B ) .
Taken together , these findings show that oxidative stress may generally suppress FasL induction in activated NK cells and that reducing conditions are necessary for optimal FasL expression .
Suppression of FasL mRNA levels and NFAT transcription factor activity in anti-CD16-treated NK cells by thiol deprivation or H , O ; treatment We next asked whether FasL mRNA expression was also suppressed by oxidative stress .
Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that the increase in FasL mRNA following treatment with anti-CD16 mAb was completely suppressed by thiol deprivation or H , O , treatment ( Fig .
4 ) .
The diminished FasL mRNA levels induced by thiol deprivation were reversed by the addition of 1-Cys , 2-ME , or NAC ( Fig .
4 ) .
In contrast , the augmentation of IFN-y mRNA levels induced by CD16 cross-linking was not affected by manipulations of cellular redox status , including thiol deprivation , H , O , treatment , or addition of 2-ME or NAC ( Fig .
4 ) , suggesting that events downstream of CD16 activation are not uniformly subject to regulation by redox .
Because the transcription factor NFAT has been reported to participate in the regulation of FasL expression in activated T cells ( 11 , 27 ) , we examined the effect of either thiol deprivation or H , O , treatment on DNA-binding activity of NFAT in anti-CD16-treated NK cells as determined by EMSA .
As shown in Fig .
5 , activation of NFAT following ligation of CD16 was inhibited by treatment with H , O ; in a dose dependent manner and completely suppressed by thiol depletion .

even augmented by 2-ME treatment compared with CYS ( + ) , indicating that thiol-reducing compounds are required for optimal activation of NFAT .
This result also suggests that oxidative stress inhibits CD16-induced FasL expression at the level of , or upstream to , NFAT activation .
Thiol deprivation and addition of H , O ; suppressed calcineurin phosphatase activity in vitro Activation of NFAT is known to be regulated by a CsA-sensitive , calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase , calcineurin ( 28 ) .
Therefore , we examined whether oxidative stress affects calcineurin activity in IL-2-preactivated NK cells .
Culture in CYS ( - ) medium for 12 h markedly suppressed calcineurin activity compared with standard medium ( Fig .
6A ) .
However , treatment of IL-2-preactivated NK cells with H , O , had only a marginal effect on calcineurin activity , even with 1 mM H ; , O ; , .
Because the calcineurin assay reaction mixture contained DTT , we next investigated the effect of incubation with H , O , in vitro of lysates from IL-2-preactivated NK cells , which had not been treated with H , O , as a more sensitive means to assess changes in calcineurin activity .
As shown in Fig .
6B , calcineurin activity in IL-2-preactivated NK cells was inhibited by H , O , in a dose-dependent fashion .

activation and FasL induction following CD16 ligation on NK cells .
Discussion The present study demonstrated that FasL expression following CD16 ligation on IL-2-preactivated NK cells was suppressed by thiol deprivation and restored by addition of thiol compounds , suggesting that cellular reducing status is required for FasL induction in CD16-stimulated NK cells .
This notion was further supported by the findings that another oxidative stressor , H , O , also inhibited CD16-induced FasL expression and that intracellular ROS levels were decreased following treatment with anti-CD16 mAb .
We further showed that oxidative stress , including thiol deprivation or H , O , treatment , suppressed events upstream of FasL expression , namely calcineurin and NFAT activation , suggesting that oxidative stress suppressed CD16-induced FasL expression through inhibition of calcineurin/NFAT activation or event ( s ) upstream thereof .
The regulation of a number of transcriptional factors by cellular redox status is well described ( 14 ) .
However , this regulation is quite complicated .
Although H , O , is known to be a potent activator of NF-KB ( 29 ) , and reductants generally decrease transcriptional activity of p53 ( 14 ) , thiol-reducing compounds activate AP-1 ( 30 , 31 ) and even increase DNA-binding activity of NF- « B REDOX CONTROL OF Fas LIGAND EXPRESSION IN HUMAN NK CELLS ( 32 ) .
In terms of NFAT , sublethal levels of oxidative stress have been reported to suppress its transcriptional activity and , thereby , IL-2 mRNA expression in activated T cells ( 33 ) .
We have recently found that DNA-binding activity of NFAT is modulated by nitric oxide , which is highly reactive with superoxide anion and thiols ( Furuke et al .
, unpublished data ) .
In the current study , we demonstrated that DNA-binding activity of NFAT is suppressed by oxidative stress , such as thiol deficiency or treatment with H , O , and thiol-reducing compounds reversed it , suggesting that the thiol-mediated reducing condition is required for NFAT activation in CD16-activated NK cells .
Activation of NFAT is well known to be regulated by a serine/ threonine phosphatase , calcineurin ( 28 ) .
Since superoxide dismutase protects calcineurin from inactivation ( 34 ) and a thiol reducing enzyme , thioredoxin , inhibits activity of CsA and FK506 , inhibitors for calcineurin ( 35 ) , we hypothesized that cellular redox status affects calcineurin activity , resulting in regulation of NFAT activity .
The evidence that the active site of calcineurin contains Fe and Zn ions ( 36 ) , both of which are redox-sensitive , supports this possibility .
Our study demonstrated that lysates from thiol-de-pleted NK cells contained lower calcineurin activity than those from normal NK cells , suggesting that calcineurin activity also requires thiol-mediated reducing conditions .
However , calcineurin activity in lysates from H , O , -treated NK cells was not significantly altered .
We also demonstrated that thiol deprivation was more potent for increasing intracellular peroxide levels than H , O , treatment .
In the calcineurin assay , sufficient doses of a reducing reagent , DTT ( 0.5 mM ) , were required to measure calcineurin activity in vitro .
Therefore , it is possible that DTT reversed an H , O , effect on calcineurin activity during the assay , although it was not sufficient to reverse the effect in cells cultured under conditions of thiol deprivation .
To determine whether H ; O ; , treatment can indeed inhibit calcineurin activity , we performed an experiment in which H , O , was directly added into the reaction mixture with the lysate from IL-2-preactivated NK cells , and the result showed that H , O , inhibited calcineurin activity in the lysate in a dose-dependent fashion .
Taken together , these findings suggest that oxidative stress , including thiol deprivation or H , O , treatment , inhibits FasL expression induced in activated NK cells through suppression of activation of calcineurin-NFAT pathway .
However , thiol deprivation appears to induce oxidative stress more efficiently than addition of H , O , since reduced calcineurin activity following thiol deprivation was observed even in the presence of DTT in the reaction .
Recent studies on Fas/FasL interaction have revealed that FasL-induced apoptosis is involved in a number of pathological condi-tions , including eliminating virus-infected or malignant cells , tumor tolerance from cytotoxic lymphocytes , graft rejection , acute hepatitis , and autoimmune disease ( 1 , 2 , 37-39 ) .
Moreover , since ROS have been implicated in the pathophysiology of these disorders ( 40 ) , oxidative stress appears to colocalize with sites of Fas/ FasL interaction .
Although there have been several reports on the redox regulation in Fas receptor expression ( 41 , 42 ) and on the involvement of ROS in FasL-induction in T cells activated through TCR-stimulation ( 43 , 44 ) , this is the first study showing the redox control of FasL expression in NK cell activation and exploring the mechanism of that control .
Our results may provide not only means to maintain optimal NK functions but also possible therapeutics for such pathological conditions .
