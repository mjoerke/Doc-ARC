The Hematopoietic Transcription Factor PU.1 Is Downregulated in Human Multiple Myeloma Cell Lines By Monica Pettersson , Christer Sundstrom , Kenneth Nilsson , and Lars-Gunnar Larsson PU.1 is a hematopoietic transcription factor belonging to the Ets-family .
It is identical to the Spi-1 oncogene , which is implicated in spleen focus-forming virus-induced murine erythroleukemias .
PU.1 seems to be required for early development of multiple hematopoietic lineages , but its expression in mature cells is preferentially observed in cells of the B-cell- and monocyte/macrophage-differentiation lineage .
It binds the so-called Pu box , an important tissue-specific regulatory DNA element present in a number of genes expressed in these cell lineages .
We have analyzed the expression and activity of PU.1 during human B-cell development using a panel of B-cell lines representing different stages of matura-tion , from early precursors to differentiated plasma cells .
PU.1 mRNA expression and PU.1 DNA binding activity , as measured by Northern blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay , respectively , were evident in cell lines representing pro-B , pre-B , and mature B cells .
We could also show Pu box-dependent transactivation of a reporter gene N IMPORTANT AREA of research on cellular differentiation is the identification of transcription factors regulating cell lineage- and differentiation stage-specific gene expression .
Examples of such factors in the hematopoietic system are the Oct-2 `` and GATA family proteins . ``
Another transcription factor specific for hematopoietic cells is PU.1 , originally described as a lymphoid- and macrophage-specific factor . ``
'' However , by gene targeting , PU.1 was recently shown to be required for the development of multiple hematopoietic lineages . ``
PU.1 belongs to the ets proto-oncogene family ( including Ets1 , Ets2 , Erg , Elf1 , GABPa , PEA3 , Fli-1 , E74A , Elk1 , and SAP1 ) characterized by the well-conserved ETS domain that mediates specific DNA binding to the core sequence GGA . ``
The N-terminal part of the protein , which is only weakly or not at all homologous to other Ets-proteins , contains a glutamine-rich transactivation domain® and is able to bind to the TATA-box-binding protein and the retinoblastoma protein Rb in vitro . ``
PU.1 also contains a motif that mediates protein-protein interactions with the B-cell-specific transcription factor NF-EMS . ``
PU.1 is identical to the oncogene Spi-1 implicated in the development of spleen focus-forming virus-induced murine Friend erythroleukemia .
Spleen focus-forming virus was found to integrate in the Spi-1 locus in 95 % of the tumors , resulting in an elevated expression of Spi-1 mRNA . ``
The observations that overexpression of Spi-1/PU.1 immortalizes primary erythroblasts `` and that antisense oligonucleotides inhibit the proliferation of Friend murine erythroleukemia cell lines `` further indicated a role for Spi-1/PU.1 in the growth control of immature erythroid cells .
Also , the Ets-family members v-Ets and Fli-1 have been implicated in the development of erythroid tumors in chickens and mice , respectively . ``
The expression of PU.1 in mature hematopoietic cells was reported to be confined to B cells , monocytes/macrophages , and mast cells , whereas it seems to be more broadly expressed at early stages of lymphoid and myeloid develop-ment .
** `` * `` This would also agree with the gene-targeting data which suggested that it is required for the early develop Blood , Vol 86 , No 7 ( October 1 ) , 1995 : pp 2747-2753 in transient transfections in these cell lines .
In contrast , in a number of multiple myeloma cell lines , representing differentiated , plasma cell-like B cells , PU.1 DNA binding activity , mRNA expression , and Pu box-dependent transactivation were absent or detectable at a very low level .
In lymphoblastoid cell lines , which exemplify an intermediate stage of B-cell differentiation , a reduced expression and activity were observed .
The findings in the human multiple myeloma cell lines represent the first examples of B cells with downregulated PU.1 expression and apparently contradict observations in the murine system in which PU.1 is expressed and active in plasmacytoma cell lines .
At present , it is unclear whether the lack of PU.1 expression and activity in human multiple myeloma cell lines represents a malignancy-associated defect in these cells or exemplifies a normal developmental regulation in terminally differentiated B cells .

ment of several lineages . ``
The PU.1 binding site , the so-called Pu box , has been identified as an important tissue-specific regulatory element in the promoters or enhancers of a number of differentiation-associated genes in different hematopoietic cell types .
* `` * `` * `` * `` `` Thus , PU.1 has been implicated as an important tissue-specific factor regulating these genes in intimate cooperation with other transcription factors ( such as NF-EMS , `` ° or Sp1* ) or other Ets-family members ( such as Ets1 , `` Erg-3 , `` or GABPa `` ) .
We are interested in the role of PU.1 during development of human B-lineage cells and its possible involvement in tumor formation in these cells A panel of human B-cell lines representing different stages of development , from early precursors to differentiated plasma cells , was used for studies of PU.1 expression and activity .
We found differences in PU.1 mRNA expression , PU.1 DNA binding , and transcriptional activity in cell lines at different maturation stages .
In particular , we can show that PU.1 activity and expression was shut off in a panel of multiple myeloma cell lines , representing differentiated B cells .
The implications of these findings will be discussed .

Plasmid constructions .
_ pCAT-Control plasmid ( Promega , Madi-son , WI ) with the SV40 early promoter and enhancer sequences served as the control plasmid in the transfection experiments .
An Xho 1 linker was cloned into the Be/ II site of pCAT-Promoter plasmid ( Promega ) , and the new plasmid was designated pPromXCAT .
Four copies of the Pu box oligonucleotides ( wild-type and mumlud ) were cloned into the oligonucleotide vector ( OVEC ) plas-mid . ``
The resulting Xho I-Sal I fragment was then inserted into the Xho I site of pPromXCAT .

RESULTS Absence of PU.1 DNA binding activity in multiple myeloma cell lines .
To establish the conditions for studies of PU.1 DNA binding , we used the human BJA-B cell line known to express PU.1.3 A P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the Pu box sequence from the SV40 control region was mixed with nuclear extracts from BJA-B cells and analyzed by EMSA .
The SV40 Pu box binds PU.1 with high affinity but is a poor binding site for many other Ets-family proteins . ``
'' `` Figure 1A shows that two major retarded com-plexes , a and b , were formed .
These complexes were competed by an access unlabeled Pu box oligonucleotide but not by a mutated oligonucleotide or an oligonucleotide containing an Spl binding site , thus showing the specificity of the binding .
The mutated oligonucleotide , previously shown to eliminate binding of PU.1 , `` contains 4 substitutions 4-7 PU.1 EXPRESSION IN HUMAN B CELLS Fig 2 .
PU.1 DNA binding activity in B-cell nuclear extracts .
EMSA using the Pu box oligonucleotide was performed with nuclear extracts prepared from the following B-cell lines : lane 1 , no extract ; lane 2 , KM3 ; lane 3 , BJA-B ; lane 4 , Daudi ; lane 5 , Raji ; lane 6 , Ramos ; lane 7 , Karpas 422 ; lane 8 , MN6O ; lane 9 , U-255 ; lane 10 , Corinna II ; lane 11 , Karpas 707 ; lane 12 , L363 ; lane 13 , U-1996 ; lane 14 , U-266-1970 ; and lane 15 , U-266-1984 .
nucleotides 5° of the the GGA core binding site for Ets-family proteins .
Addition to the binding reaction of antibodies directed to the N-terminus of PU.1 resulted in a supershift of the upper but not the lower Pu box binding complex , thus confirming the presence of PU.1 or an antigenically closely related protein in the former ( Fig 1B ) .
Addition to the binding reaction of antibodies specific for the C-terminus of PU .
1 prevented formation of both the upper and lower complexes ( data not shown ) , indicating that the lower complex represents a degradation product of PU.1 containing the DNA binding domain but lacking the N-terminal antibody-binding epitope .
PU.1 contains a so-called PEST sequence suggested to play a role in protein degradation .
** `` To investigate the DNA binding activity of PU.1 in relation to B-cell differentiation , nuclear extracts were prepared from various human B-cell lines representing different stages of B-cell differentiation .
These included the pro-B-cell line KM3 ; the B-lymphoma cell lines BJA-B , Raji , Daudi , and Ramos representing pre-B to mature B cells ; the Karpas 422 follicular lymphoma cell line and B-leukemia cell line MN6O0 representing mature B cells ; the U-255 and Corinna II Ig-secreting lymphoblastoid cell lines and , finally , the multiple myeloma cell lines Karpas 707 , L363 , U-1996 , U-266-1970 , and U-266-1984 representing plasmablasts-plasma cells .
The extracts were analyzed by EMSA using the Pu box sequence as above .
Figure 2 shows that a Pu box-binding complex comigrating with the upper PU.1 complex in BJA-B cells was clearly shown in the cell lines representing early and mature B cells ( Fig 2 , lanes 2-8 ) .
In contrast , three of the myeloma cell lines , U-1996 , U-266-1970 , and U-266-1984 , were completely negative ; in the other two , L363 and Karpas 707 , a very faint band could be detected ( Fig 2 , lanes 11-15 ) .
Compared with early and mature B-cell lines , a reduced PU.1 binding activity was observed in the lymphoblastoid cell lines , in particular in Corinna II ( Fig 2 , lanes 9 and 10 ) .
Figure 3 shows that an oligonucleotide containing an Spl binding site showed specific Spl binding activity in the myeloma cell extracts as well as in BJA-B extracts , thus ruling out a general degradation of the myeloma extracts .

_ We next investigated whether the observed binding of PU.1 to the Pu box in the various extracts correlated with transcriptional activity .
Four copies of the Pu box oligonucleotide and a mutated version thereof were cloned upstream of the SV40 early promoter in a CAT gene construct .
The plasmids were transfected into selected B-cell lines , and , 72 hours after transfection , the cells were harvested and assayed for CAT activity .
A construct with the SV40 early promoter and enhancer sequences was H MUN- u h 1 2 3 4 5 6 T7 8 Fig 3 .
Sp1 DNA binding activity in B-cell nuclear extracts .
An oligonucleotide containing two Sp1 binding sites was mixed with the following B-cell extracts and subjected to EMSA : lane 1 , no extract ; lane 2 and 3 , BJA-B ; lane 4 , Karpas 707 ; lane 5 , L363 ; lane 6 , U-1996 ; lane 7 , U-266-1970 ; and lane 8 , U-266-1984 .
In lane 3 , a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled Sp1 sequence is included in the mixture .
2750 form m thir trie i transfected in parallel and served as a positive control .
In the BJA-B , Raji , U-255 , and Karpas 422 cell lines , the presence of the Pu boxes led to an enhanced transcription from the CAT gene to various degrees , whereas mutations introduced in the Pu box reduced the activity to basal level ( Fig 4 ) .
Densitometrical scanning of the autoradiogram and normalizing to the activity of pPromXCAT vector lacking Pu boxes showed that four copies of the Pu box stimulated transcription 28 times in BJA-B cells , 8 times in Raji cells , and 3 times in U-255 and Karpas 422 cells .
Transfection of the myeloma cell lines L363 and U-266-1984 with the Pu box-containing plasmids did not lead to activation of the CAT gene , thus correlating with the lack of Pu box binding in these cells .
A control CAT reporter plasmid containing SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences strongly stimulated transcription in the myeloma cell lines .
We were also unable to detect any Pu box-dependent transcriptional activity in the Corinna II lymphoblastoid cell line , which has a reduced PU.1 binding activity .
The PU.1 gene is downregulated in multiple myeloma cell lines .
- The lack of PU.1 activity in the myeloma cells could be because of a downregulation of the PU.1 gene expression or , alternatively , because the protein is present in an inactive form .
To investigate the expression of PU.1 in the panel of B-cell lines used above , RNA was prepared , and a Northern blot analysis was performed using a mouse PU.1 cDNA as probe .
Figure 5A shows that the 1.4-kb PU.1 transcript was expressed in all B-cell lines with the exception of the myeloma cell lines , in which it was undetectable even after prolonged exposure .
The lymphoblastoid cell line U-255 showed a reduced expression , and the level of PU.1 mRNA was very low , but detectable , in Corinna II .
As a control , the same filter was rehybridized with a GAPDH probe , showing that this gene was expressed in all cell lines ( Fig 5B ) .
We conclude that the PU.1 gene is shut off in the myeloma PETTERSSON ET AL t11 ?

PU.1 EXPRESSION IN HUMAN B CELLS precursor cells .
It has also been suggested to play a role in mature B cells and macrophages .
We have undertaken a study to investigate the presence and activity of PU.1 during human B-cell development using a panel of human B-cell lines representing the B-cell lineage from early precursors to differentiated plasma cells .
Our results show major differences in the expression and activity of PU.1 in cell lines representing different levels of B-cell development .
PU.1 mRNA expression and PU.1 DNA binding activity was shown in the pro-B-cell line KM3 as well as in pre-B and mature B-cell lines .
Pu box-dependent transcriptional activity of a CAT reporter gene was also shown in these cell lines in transient transfections .
In contrast , in a panel of multiple myeloma cell lines representing differentiated B cells , no or only very low mRNA expression , DNA binding activity , and Pu box-dependent transactivation were detectable .
A reduced PU.1 activity and expression were observed in the lymphoblastoid cell lines U-255 and Corinna II , representing an intermediate stage of differentiation .
This reduction was most pronounced in Corinna II , which seems further differentiated than many other Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines in that it lacks CD37 expression ( our unpublished observations ) .
However , Corinna H is clearly less differentiated than the myeloma cell lines . ``
'' Our observations in human pro-B , pre-B and mature B cells are in good agreement with previous studies in murine B-cell lines . ``
'' However , the lack of PU.1 expression and activity in human multiple myeloma cell lines is a unique finding and represents the first example of B cells with downregulated PU.1 expression .
Our results are apparently contradictory to results obtained in the murine system , in which PU.1 is expressed and active in most plasmacytoma cell lines .
* `` `` * `` Our finding in human multiple myeloma cell lines may be interpreted in at least two different ways .
( 1 ) Because PU.1 seems generally expressed in other B cells , one interpretation is that the lack of PU.1 is a malignancy-associated defect common to human multiple myeloma .
If PU.1 is an important transcription factor involved in commitment along the B lineage , it is conceivable that loss of PU.1 may result in problems for the cell to recognize itself as a B cell , and , thus , it may be unable to complete the differentiation program and develop into terminally differentiated , resting plasma cells .
However , from Southern analysis ( data not shown ) and cytogenetic analysis of chromosome 11 , `` *° we have found no evidence for chromosomal aberrations of the PU.1 loci in the myeloma cell lines .
This does not exclude minor alterations such as small deletions or point mutations .
( 2 ) An alternative interpretation is that the shutoff of the PU.1 gene is a normal event occurring at a late stage of B-cell development corresponding to that of the myeloma cell lines .
This interpretation is supported by the reduced expression and activity in the U-255 and Corinna II cell lines representing an intermediate stage of differentiation .
Data from homozygous gene-targeted PU.1 mouse embryos suggest that PU.1 is a very early hematopoietic transcription factor required for generation of B- and T-lymphocyte , monocyte , and granulocyte progenitors , thus acting already 2751 at a stage of a multipotent stem cell . ``
This interpretation would be in agreement with previous expression studies suggesting that PU.1 is expressed in early myeloid/lymphoid cells committed to the erythroid , granulocytic , monocytic , mast cell , B- and T-lymphoid lineages .
It is then shut off early in T-cell , erythroid , and granulocytic differentiation but is expressed at later stages of monocytic , mast cell , and B-cell differentiation .
* `` `` `` `` The present data may suggest that it is shut off late during B-cell differentiation , thus performing its function at preterminal stages of B-cell development .
From this perspective , the differences in expression in human myelomas and murine plasmacytomas may be because of slight differences in maturation stage or a malignancy-associated inability to shut off PU.1 in the plasmacytomas or might represent a species difference .
Studies of PU.1 expression in normal human and mouse plasma cells are required to clarify these points .
It may seem remarkable that PU.1 is shut off in human myeloma cell lines that produce Ig at a high level , because PU.1 has been suggested to be one important transcriptional activator of both the heavy- and light-chain Ig genes . ``
However , there are alternative pathways of Ig gene regulation mediated by , for instance , Oct-2 and NF- « B , acting on the heavy chain enhancer and on the -chain intron enhancer , respectively , that seem to increase in importance at late stages of B-cell differentiation . ``
Therefore , such alternative pathways may be in operation in the human myeloma cell lines .
Other genes suggested to be regulated by PU.1 in B cells are the J-chain , `` the mb-1 and B29 antigen receptor-associated signaling proteins , `` 3 ; integrins , `` and the major histocompatibility complex class II antigens . ``
The expression of these genes seems to be connected to B-cell activation , proliferation , and IgM secretion at preterminal stages of differentiation rather than to terminally differentiated plasma cells or myelomas .
Therefore , one interesting possibility is that PU.1 might be a transcription factor which integrates differentiation and cell growth at proliferative stages along the B-cell differentiation lineage .
The oncogenic potential of PU.1/Spi-1 in erythroleukemia and its ability to interact with Rb in vitro would point in this direction .
Immunohistochemical studies in normal murine bone barrow also suggest the highest expression of PU.1 in dividing cells . ``
An attractive hypothesis is that PU.1 is replaced by an alternative Ets-family or a non-Ets transcription factor such as Oct-2 or NF- « B , lacking proliferative or having an antiproliferative capacity , at terminal stages of B-cell differentiation in which high expression of the differentiation-associated genes is connected to irreversible growth-arrest .
Examples of other Ets-family members expressed in hematopoietic cells are Ets1 , Ets2 , Erg , Fli-1 , Elf1 , GABPa , and/or SpiB . ``
The EMSA and transactivation assays in the myelomas suggest that PU.1 is not replaced by an Ets-family protein with capacity to bind the SV40 Pu box .
However , other PU.1 binding sites in relevant cellular target genes may have a broader Ets-family binding specificity that could result in a competition between different Ets-family proteins or a sequential role of these during B-cell development .
Further studies of PU.1 and other Ets-family proteins during normal B-cell development is re 2752 quired to establish whether our findings in multiple myeloma cell lines represent a malignancy-associated deregulation of PU.1 in these cells or exemplify a normal phase of B-cell differentiation .
