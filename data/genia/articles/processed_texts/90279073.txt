7 Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigen 2 Transactivates Latent Membrane Protein FRED WANG , * SO-FAI TSANG , MICHAEL G. KURILLA , JEFFREY I. COHEN , anp ELLIOTT KIEFF Departments of Medicine and Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , Harvard Medical School , 75 Francis Street , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Received 17 January 1990/Accepted 2 April 1990 Several lines of evidence are compatible with the hypothesis that Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA-2 ) or leader protein ( EBNA-LP ) affects expression of the EBV latent infection membrane protein LMP1 .
We now demonstrate the following .
( i ) Acute transfection and expression of EBNA-2 under control of simian virus 40 or Moloney murine leukemia virus promoters resulted in increased LMP1 expression in P3HR-1-infected Burkitt 's lymphoma cells and the P3HR-1 or Daudi cell line .
( ii ) Transfection and expression of EBNA-LP alone had no effect on LMP1 expression and did not act synergistically with EBNA-2 to affect LMP1 expression .
( iii ) LMP1 expression in Daudi and P3HR-1-infected cells was controlled at the mRNA level , and EBNA-2 expression in Daudi cells increased LMP1 mRNA .
( iv ) No other EBV genes were required for EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP1 since cotransfection of recombinant EBNA-2 expression vectors and genomic LMP1 DNA fragments enhanced LMP1 expression in the EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell lines BJAB , Louckes , and BL30 .
( v ) An EBNA-2-responsive element was found within the -512 to +40 LMP1 DNA since this DNA linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was transactivated by cotransfection with an EBNA-2 expression vector .
( vi ) The EBV type 2 EBNA-2 transactivated LMPI1 as well as the EBV type 1 EBNA-2 .
( vii ) Two deletions within the EBNA-2 gene which rendered EBV transformation incompetent did not transactivate LMP1 , whereas a transformation-competent EBNA-2 deletion mutant did transactivate LMP1 .
LMP1 is a potent effector of B-lymphocyte activation and can act synergistically with EBNA-2 to induce cellular CD23 gene expression .
Thus , EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP1 amplifies the biological impact of EBNA-2 and underscores its central role in EBV-induced growth transformation .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) can cause B-lymphoprolifera-tive disorders in immunocompromised or genetically susceptible humans ( 6 , 33 ) and in marmosets ( 42 ) .
In vitro , EBV infection efficiently induces immunoglobulin secretion and perpetual B-lymphocyte proliferation ( 17 , 32 ) .
The functions of the six nuclear proteins ( EBV nuclear antigen [ EBNA ] -1 , -2 , -3A , -3B , -3C , and leader protein [ EBNA-LP ] ) and three latent membrane proteins ( LMP1 , LMP2A , and LMP2B ) expressed from the viral genome during latent , growth-transforming infection are being actively investigated ( see reference 20 for a review ) .
LMPI appears to be important for growth transformation since transfection and expression in rodent fibroblasts results in reduced serum dependence , anchorage independence , and tumorigenicity in nude mice ( 2 , 44 , 45 ) .
In various EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cells , LMPI induces phenotypic changes characteristic of B-cell activation including induction of cellular adhesion molecules , transferrin recep-tor , CD21 , CD23 , CD39 , CD44 , and vimentin ( 3 , 46 , 49 ) .
EBNA-2 or EBNA-LP is necessary for B-lymphocyte growth transformation .
The Daudi and P3HR-1 EBV strains are deleted for EBNA-2 and part of the EBNA-LP genes ( 4 , 15 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 34 ) and are unable to immortalize B lymphocytes ( 19 , 28 ) .
P3HR-1 recombination with other EBV strains or cloned EBV DNA fragments which results in reconstitution of the P3HR-1 deletion restores the transforming phenotype ( 7 , 13 , 43 ) .
EBNA-2 is essential for growth transformation since truncation ( 13 ) or deletions within the EBNA-2 open reading frame ( 7 ) result in transformation-incompetent EBV .
In rat-l rodent fibroblasts , EBNA-2 reduces serum dependency but does not affect contact * Corresponding author .
3407 inhibition , anchorage independence , or tumorigenicity ( 9 ) .
In the EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell lines Louckes and BJAB , EBNA-2 alone induces CD21 and CD23 expression without concomitantly inducing other activation antigens or cellular adhesion molecules ( 47 , 48 ) .
Several experiments suggest that EBNA-2 or EBNA-LP also affects LMP1 expression .
First , EBNA-2 and LMP1 are often difficult to detect in early passage Burkitt 's tumor cell lines and coordinately increase in abundance with cell passage ( 38 ) .
Second , EBV-negative Burkitt 's tumor cells stably infected with the P3HR-1 EBV strain do not express EBNA-2 , a normal EBNA-LP , or LMP1 , while cells stably infected with EBV strain B95-8 express EBNA-2 , a complete EBNA-LP , and LMPI1 ( 31 ) .
Third , B cells immortalized by recombinant P3HR-1 with a restored EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP express normal LMP1 levels ( 7 ) .
Fourth , cat reporter gene expression under control of the LMP1 promoter ( -512 to +40 ) was higher in cells stably infected with B95-8 EBV , which expressed EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP , compared with cells stably infected with P3HR-1 EBV , which lacks EBNA-2 and a complete EBNA-LP ( 11 ) .
The objective of the experiments reported here is to investigate directly whether EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP , either individually or together , transactivate LMP1 .

Plasmids .
The pSGS expression vector ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif. ) contains the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) early promoter , a beta-globin intron , and an SV40 polyadenylation signal .
EBV DNA fragments encoding the EBV type 1 EBNA-2 ( nucleotides 48475 to 50306 of B95-8 EBV ) or EBV type 2 EBNA-2 ( an Rsal partial digest of the Ag876 EBV BamHI D1 fragment ) were cloned into the pSGS vector and are referred to as SV-EBINA2 and SV-EB2NA2 , respectively .
The pZipNeoSV ( X ) -1 expression vectors containing the EBV type 1 and type 2 EBNA-2 open reading frames only have been previously described ( 9 , 48 ) and are referred to here as pZip-EBINA2 and pZip-EB2NA2 .
The HindIII fragments of each vector were also cloned into pUCI18 to generate a smaller plasmid containing the Moloney murine leukemia virus ( MuLV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and EBNA-2 gene ( LTR-EBINA2 and LTR-EB2NA2 ) .
The pZip-ELP expression vector contains the EBNA-LP open reading frame derived from an EcoRI-to-FnudlI fragment of the T65 cDNA ( 39 ) .
These vectors express the appropriate EBV protein after stable transfection into human EBV-negative B-lymphoma cells ( 47 , 48 ) .
The LTR-ELP vector is the HindIII fragment of pZip-T65 and contains the MuLV LTR and the bicistronic T6S cDNA .
LTR-ELP expresses only EBNA-LP after transfection into EBV-negative B-lymphoma cells ( 47 , 48 ) .
EBNA-2 mutations were all derived from the B95-8 EBV EBNA-2 ( nucleotides 48475 to 50306 ) and cloned into the pZipNeoSV ( X ) -1 expression vector .
Deletions were constructed by restriction enzyme digestion and are named according to the deleted EBNA-2 amino acids ( pZip-E2d19-115 , HinclI to BamHI ; pZip-E2d148-324 , BsfEIll to Ball ; pZip-E2d200-234 , StuI to Stul ) .
The Ny , , plasmid contains the BamHI Ny , , fragment of B95-8 EBV DNA from nucleotide 166,614 across the terminal repeats to nucleotide 3,955 in pUC18 .
The NdEco plasmid ( nucleotides 166,614 to 1 ) was derived by digestion of Ny , , .
, with EcoRI and cloning into pUC18 .
Both constructs appear to have only one copy of the terminal repeat by restriction enzyme digests .
The -512/+40 LMPCAT construct was derived by cloning the -512 to +40 latent membrane protein ( LMP1 ) upstream sequences relative to the BNLFI start site into the Bglll site of pCAT ( 11 ) .
pCAT and pSV2CAT contain the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene ( cat ) without and with the SV40 early promoter , respectively .
Transfections .
A total of 5 x 10° cells in log-phase growth were suspended in 0.3 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum at room temperature and placed in a Gene Pulser cuvette ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Richmond , Calif. ) .
A 15-ug sample of each uncut plasmid DNA which had been purified twice on cesium chloride gradients was added to the cuvette .
Equal amounts of total DNA were added to each sample within any single experiment .
Cells were electropo-rated with 0.2 V at 960 wF ( Gene Pulser ) and then suspended in 10 ml of RPMI 1640-10 % fetal bovine serum and cultured at 37°C .
After 4 days , cells were harvested , counted , and then assayed .
Transfection efficiencies for EBNA-2 were J. Viror .
determined in all experiments by immunofluorescence with an EBNA-2-specific monoclonal antibody .
Each type of acute transfection experiment was repeated at least three times .
Immunoprecipitations .
Cells were pelleted by centrifugation , suspended in 100 pl of buffer A ( 10 mM Tris hydro-chloride [ pH 7.4 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 0.5 % Triton X-100 ) , mixed with 0.09 g of urea and 4.2 pl of 2-mercaptoethanol , and vortexed to extract the detergent-soluble and -insoluble LMP1 fractions ( 23 ) .
Buffer B ( 1 mt ) ( 10 mM Tris hydrochlo-ride [ pH 7.4 ] , 250 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1.0 % Triton X-100 , 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ) was added , and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation .
Equal portions of the LMP1-specific murine monoclonal antibody $ 12 ( 26 ) were added to each sample and incubated at 4°C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose CL4B ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , Mo . )
was added , and samples were mixed for 30 min at 4°C .
Immunoprecipitates were removed by gentle centrifugation and washed twice with buffer B. Immunoprecipitates were then suspended in gel loading buffer , boiled , and analyzed by immunoblotting .
After LMP immunoprecipitation , EBNA-2 was immunoprecipitated by diluting the sample with 5 ml of buffer A and adding the EBNA-2-specific murine monoclonal antibody PE2 ( 51 ) .
Subsequent steps were as described above except that protein G-Sepharose 4 ( Pharmacia , Inc. , Piscataway , N.J. ) was used to immunoprecipitate PE2 and washes were with buffer A .
All buffers contained protease inhibitors ( 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 0.7 ug of pepstatin per ml , 0.5 ug of leupeptin per ml , 1.0 ug of aprotinin per ml ) .
LMP1 and EBNA-2 were quantitatively immunoprecipitated by these procedures with up to 5 x 10° EBV-infected cells , indicating that antibodies were in excess in immunoprecipitations from acute transfections .
The LMP1 or EBNA-2 expression level in acute transfections was in all instances substantially less than that of 5 x 10° EBV-infected cells owing to the fact that only a minority of cells were successfully transfected .
Immunoblotting .
Cell lysis , sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis , electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose , and immunoblotting were performed as previously described ( 9 ) .
Pooled EBV-immune human sera followed by *'**I-protein A were used for detection of EBNAs .
LMP was detected with the monoclonal antibody $ 12 ( 26 ) followed by a rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antiserum and ** `` I-protein A .
All X-ray film was preflashed before autoradiography .
Immunofluorescence .
Cells for immunofluorescence were pelleted by centrifugation , smeared onto microscope slides , air dried , and then fixed for 7 min in ice-cold 1:1 methanol-acetone .
Slides were blocked with 10 % goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and stained with either an EBNA-2-specific monoclonal antibody , PE2 ( 51 ) , or LMP1-specific monoclonal antibodies CS1 to CS4 ( kindly provided by M. Rowe and A .
B. Rickinson [ 37 ] ) for 1 h. Slides were washed for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antiserum .
EBNA-LP immunofluorescence was performed similarly with an affinity-purified monospecific human antiserum against EBNA-LP ( 49 ) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin antiserum .
Slides were washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline and viewed under fluorescence microscopy .
CAT assays .
CAT assays were as described previously ( 12 ) except that cells were harvested 4 days after transfection , Vor .

RESULTS EBNA-2 induces LMP1 in Daudi and P3HR-1-infected cells , while EBNA-LP has no effect .
P3HR-1 and Daudi EBV are notable for their deletion of a DNA fragment which encodes EBNA-2 and the two 3 ' unique exons of EBNA-LP ( Fig .
1 ) ( 4 , 15 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 34 ) .
Although the LMP1 regulatory and coding regions are more than 50 kilobases ( kb ) 5 ' to this deletion , LMP expression in the P3HR-1 cell line ( Fig .
2 , lane 3 ) was markedly reduced compared with that of an EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line , IB4 ( Fig .
2 , lane 1 ) , and was undetectable in the Daudi cell line ( Fig .
2 , lane 4 ) ( 14 ) by immunoblotting .
EBV-negative BL30 and BL41 cells stably infected with P3HR-1 EBV also expressed little , if any , LMP1 ( Fig .
2 , lanes 7 and 11 ) , whereas the identical cells infected with the prototype B95-8 EBV expressed high levels of LMP1 ( Fig .
2 , lanes 6 and 10 ) ( 29 ) .

or a complete EBNA-LP may be required for high-level LMP ] expression .
To evaluate the role of the EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP deletion , we studied the acute effect of EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP , alone or in combination , on LMP1 expression in P3HR-l-infected or Daudi lymphoma cells .
The EBV type 1 or type 2 EBNA-2 open reading frames were expressed under control of the early SV40 promoter ( SV-EBINAZ or SV-EB2NA2 ) or under control of the MuLV LTR ( LTR-EBINAZ or LTR-EB2NA2 ) .
EBNA-LP was expressed from the bicistronic T6S5 cDNA ( LTR-ELP ) or the monocistronic EBNA-LP open reading frame ( pZip-ELP ) under control of the MuLV LTR .
Although the T6S cDNA contains the EBNA-2 open reading frame after the EBNA-LP open reading frame , only EBNA-LP is expressed in detectable levels in B-lymphoma cells ( 47 , 48 ) .
Four days after transfection of SV-EBINA2 or SV-EB2NA2 into BL30/P3HR-1 cells , immunofluorescent staining for EBNA-2 revealed speckled nuclear staining with nucleolar sparing characteristic of EBNA-2 in 2 to 8 % of the cells ( data not shown ) .
There was an equal distribution of cells which stained less , equally , or more intensely than an EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell line control .
Immunofiu-orescent staining for LMP revealed bright membrane-staining cells when BL30/P3HR-1 cells were transfected with SV-EBINA2 or SV-EB2NA2 but no bright membrane-staining cells in BL30/P3HR-1 cells transfected with vector control DNA ( data not shown ) .
The percentage of LMP1-staining cells was always slightly lower than the percentage of EBNA-2-positive cells , probably because of the easier discrimination of low-level nuclear fluorescence .
Identical experiments with P3HR-1 or Daudi cells revealed similar results ( data not shown ) .
LMP1 expression in transfected BL30/P3HR-1 and Daudi cells was also quantitatively assayed by sequential immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting .
LMP was readily detectable in immunoprecipitates from BL30/P3HR-1 cells transfected with either SV-EBINA2 ( Fig .
3A , lane 3 ) or SV-EB2NA-2 ( Fig .
3A , lane 4 ) .
Little or no LMP was detected in immunoprecipitates from vector control-transfected cells ( Fig .
3A , lane 2 ) or an equivalent number of nontransfected BL30/P3HR-1 cells ( Fig .
3A , lane 8 ) .
The 50-and 54-kilodalton ( kDa ) proteins are from the immunopre-cipitating $ 12 monoclonal antibody , which is detected in the subsequent immunoblots by the secondary rabbit antiserum against mouse immunoglobulin .
LMP1 immunoprecipitation from 5 x 10 % IB4 cells mixed with nontransfected BL30/ P3HR-1 cells was a control for the immunoprecipitation ( Fig .
3A , lane 9 ) .
Recombinant MuLV EBINA-2 or EB2NA-2 expression vectors also induced LMP1 expression 4 days after transfection into BL3O0/P3HR-1 cells ( Fig .
3A , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
A similar vector containing the EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 bicistronic cDNA ( LTR-ELP ) did not induce LMP1 ( Fig .
3A , lane 5 ) .
Acute EBNA-LP expression was not assayed in these experiments since BL30/P3HR-1 cells already express a truncated , serologically reactive EBNA-LP ( 49 ; unpublished observations ) .
However , in control experiments in EBV-negative BJAB cells , the EBNA-LP expression vectors ( LTR-ELP and pZip-ELP ) acutely ex-press , EBNA-LP levels comparable to those of an EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell line by immunofluorescence with an affinity-purified monospecific human antiserum to EBNA-LP ( 49 ; data not shown ) .
The acute transfection efficiency of the EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 vectors was also similar .
Furthermore , these EBNA-LP expression vectors were previously shown to produce appropriate EBNA-LP J. ViroL .

Immunoprecipitations from an equivalent number of untransfected cells ( panel A , lane 8 ; panel B , lane 11 ; and panel C , lane 6 ) or untransfected cells plus 5 x 10* IB4 cells ( panel A , lane 9 ; and panel C , lane 7 ) are also shown as controls .

levels after stable transfection into B-lymphoma cells ( 47 , 48 ) .
Moreover , the recombinant constructs were similar to the EBNA-2 expression vectors which transactivated LMP1 expression in these transient assays .
As was previously observed with stable transfection and expression of LTR-ELP ( 47 , 48 ) , acute LTR-ELP transfection resulted in EBNA-LP but no detectable EBNA-2 expression by immunofluorescence ( data not shown ) .
Thus , EBV type 1 or type 2 EBNA-2 alone induced LMP ] expression in BL30/P3HR-1 cells , while EBNA-LP had no effect .
EB2ZNA-2 consistently induced as much or more LMP1 than did EBINA-2 , perhaps in part because of a slightly higher percentage of EB2NA-2 expression .
Acute EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP1 could also be demonstrated in the Daudi cell line .
Transfection of SV-EBINA2 or SV-EB2NA2 into Daudi cells induced LMPI1 which was slightly smaller than the B95-8 EBV LMPI1 ( Fig .
3C , lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 1 and 7 ) .
The relatively low LMP1 induction is due in part to a 1 to 2 % Daudi transfection efficiency as determined by EBNA-2 immunofluorescence .

Cytoplasmic RNA ( 15 ug ) was loaded into each lane .
( A ) Blot was hybridized with LMP1 and gamma-actin probes .
( B ) Two clones of vector control-transfected Daudi cells ( DAPZ-1 , -2 ) and two clones of pZip-EBINA2Z-transfected Daudi cells ( DAEZA-1 , -2 ) were hybridized with a probe for EBNA-2 ( left panel ) or a 3.0-kb probe for LMP1 ( right panel ) .
The LMP1 probe includes the entire open reading frame and a large portion of the 3 ' untranslated end .
< < indicates the Daudi LMP mRNA , which is the only mRNA detected with a probe specific for LMP1 derived for the 5 ' exon of the LMP mRNA .
Hybridization of this blot with an actin probe demonstrated comparable amounts of RNA in all lanes ( not shown ) .
Since both P3HR-1 and Daudi EBV lack a complete EBNA-LP as well as EBNA-2 , further experiments addressed whether a complete EBNA-LP might synergize with EBNA-2 to induce LMP1 .
As above , EBNA-LP ( pZip-ELP or LTR-T65 ; Fig .
3B , lane 3 or 8 , respectively ) did not induce LMP in BL30/P3HR-1 cells , whereas both SV-EBINAZ and SV-EB2NA2 ( Fig .
3B , lanes 6 and 7 ) induced LMP1 expression .
Cotransfection of pZip or LTR EBNA-LP expression vectors with an EBNA-2 expression vector did not increase LMP expression over that obtained with EBNA-2 alone ( Fig .
3B , lanes 4 , 5 , 9 , and 10 versus lanes 6 and 7 ) .
Thus , EBNA-LP does not transactivate LMP1 expression or modify the effect of EBNA-2 on LMP1 expression in the context of the P3HR-1 or Daudi EBV genomes .
Northern blot analysis of isogenic Burkitt 's lymphoma cells infected with B95-8 or P3HR-1 EBV or Daudi cells stably transfected with pZip-EBINAZ indicated that EBNA-2 induces LMP1 mRNA .
The first evidence for an effect at the mRNA level was the observation that BL41/P3HR-1 cells did not express detectable LMPI1 protein ( Fig .
2 , lane 7 ) or mRNA ( Fig .
4A , lane 1 ) , whereas BL41/B95-8 cells expressed high levels of both LMPI1 protein ( Fig .
2 , lane 6 ) and mRNA ( Fig .
4A , lane 2 ) ( 8 ) .
More directly , Daudi cells did not express LMP1 protein or mRNA ( Fig .
2 , lane 4 , and Fig .
4B , lanes 9 and 10 ) , while three clones derived by stable transfection of Daudi cells with pZip-EBINA2 had detect-able , albeit low , EBNA-2 levels ( two clones shown in Fig .
4B , lanes 5 and 6 ) and LMP mRNA ( Fig .
4B , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
No LMP1 protein induction was detected by immuno-blot , probably owing to the low level of EBNA-2 protein expression ( approximately 10 % of 1B4 ; data not shown ) .
The EBNA-2-transfected Daudi cells had two messages that hybridized to an EBNA-2 probe ( Fig .
4B , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
The 6.8-kb mRNA was the size expected for a 5'-to-3 ' LTR transcript , while the 2.4-kb mRNA was the size expected for a transcript which is polyadenylated at the polyadenylation site of the EBNA-2 insert .
The LMP probe detected 3.0- , 2.4- , and 1.0-kb mRNAs in the EBNA-2-expressing clones but not in the vector control clones ( Fig .
4B , lanes 11 and 12 versus lanes 9 and 10 ) .
The 2.4- and 1.0-kb mRNAs likely represent productive cycle messages ( 18 ) which map 3 ' to LMP1 since they did not hybridize to a probe specific for the 5 ' part of the LMP1 mRNA .
The 5° LMP1 probe identifies a 3.0-kb RNA as the mRNA expressed from the Daudi LMP1 promoter ( data not shown ) .
These data suggest that EBNA-2 up regulates LMP mRNA and may also up regulate RNAs expressed from this part of the genome during virus replica-tion .
EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP1 does not require repeating EBNA-LP domains or other EBV proteins .
Daudi or P3HR-l-infected cells still express EBNA-1 , EBNA-3A , and EBNA-3C as well as a truncated EBNA-LP , and these may be necessary for the transactivation of LMP by EBNA-2 .
We therefore evaluated the effect of EBNA-2 on LMPI expression from a cotransfected EBV DNA fragment in EBV-negative B-lymphoma cells .
The B95-8 EBV BamHI Ny , , fragment contains the entire LMP1 gene and approximately 5.4 kb of upstream sequences .
Transfection of the BamHI Ny , , fragment into EBV-negative B-lymphoma BJAB or Louckes cells resulted in detectable LMP1 expression by immunoprecipitation ( Fig .
5A , lanes 3 and 14 ) .
SV-EBINA2 cotransfection induced more LMP1 expression from the BamHI Ny , , fragment than cotransfection with the pSGS5 vector control DNA ( Fig .
5A , lanes 4 and 15 versus lanes 3 and 14 ) .
A similar effect was evident in EBV -negative BL30 cells ( Fig .
5A , lanes 8 and 9 ) , although SV-EBINA2-induced LMP1 expression was less because of a lower transfection efficiency in BL30 cells .
In each of these cells , the levels of transactivation approximated that noted in transient transfection of the P3HR-1-infected B-lymphoma cells with EBNA-2 alone .
Further , EBNA-LP alone ( Fig .
5A , lanes 5 , 10 , and 16 ) or in combination with EBNA-2 ( Fig .
SA , lanes 6 , 11 , and 17 ) did not affect LMP1 expression .
Thus , other EBV genes were not required for the effect of EBNA-2 on LMP1 expression in EBV-negative B-lym- 3412 WANG ET AL .

Plasmid DNAs transfected into the B-lymphoma cells analyzed in each lane are indicated by a + above the lane .
phoma cells , and EBNA-LP , specifically , had no effect either alone or in combination with EBNA-2 .
EBNA-2-responsive element is within +40 to -512 relative to LMP1 cap site .
A positive EBNA-2 effect on LMPI1 expression can still be demonstrated if the BamHI Ny , , fragment is truncated so that only 1.3 kb of LMPI ] upstream sequences remain ( NdEco ; Fig .
1 ) .
Cotransfection of NdEco with SV-EBINA2 showed more than a twofold increase in LMP1 expression compared with NdEco plus vector control DNA in BJAB cells ( Fig .
5B , lanes 7 and 9 versus lanes 6 and 8 ) and in Louckes cells ( Fig .
5B , lane 17 versus lane 16 ) .
LMP1 expression from NdEco was consistently higher than from the longer BamHI Ny , , fragment by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence ( Fig .
5B , lane 6 versus lane 2 and lane 16 versus lane 14 ; and data not shown ) .
This effect may be due in part to the absence of inhibitory sequences between -1280 and -2350 defined by previous CAT analysis of LMP ] upstream sequences in EBV-infected cells ( 11 ) or due to increased transfection efficiency from the slightly smaller NdEco plasmid .
To further define the EBNA-2-responsive element , we studied the EBNA-2 responsiveness of the CAT gene ( cat ) under control of the -512 to +40 LMP1 upstream sequences ( -512/+40 LMPCAT ) .
These sequences contain an element that is more active in B95-8 EBV-infected cells than in P3HR-1 EBV-infected cells ( 11 ) .
Cotransfection of EBINA-2-expressing plasmids versus vector control plasmids induced at least fourfold-increased CAT expression from -512/+40 LMPCAT ( Fig .
6 ) .
The -512/+40 LMPCAT plasmid was responsive to cotransfection with SV-EBINA2 or pZip-EBINA2 as opposed to cotransfection with vector control DNA into BL30/P3HR-1 cells ( Fig .
6A ) .
EBINA-2 had no significant effect on expression from the promoterless pCAT or SV40 promoter-driven pSV2CAT controls .
Al though slight increases in pSV2CAT activity were occasionally observed in EBNA-2 versus vector control cotransfec-tions , slight decreases with EBNA-2 and pSV2CAT cotransfections were equally as frequent .
In contrast , EBNA-2 consistently increased -512/+40 LMPCAT activ-ity , by as much as 15-fold .
The positive EBNA-2 effect on -512/+40 LMPCAT also did not require expression of other EBV genes since similar results could be obtained in the EBV-negative cell line Louckes ( Fig .
6B ) .
EBNA-2 effect on LMP1 expression is human B lymphocyte specific .
Similar experiments were performed in cell lines other than human B lymphomas to assess the species and tissue specificity of the EBNA-2 effect .
No EBNA-2 enhancement of LMP1 expression was observed in a human T-cell-lymphotropic virus type I-transformed human T-cell line ( MT-2 ) , the HeLa cell line , or in two mouse B-cell lines ( A20 and M12 ; data not shown ) .
There was basal LMP1 expression from transfected BamHI Ny , , or NdEco in all cell lines as observed in the EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell lines and EBNA-2 expression as high as 30 % in HeLa cells as positive controls for transfection .
The lack of an EBNA-2 effect in these cell lines suggests that a human B-lympho-cyte-specific factor is required for EBNA-2 transactivation of LMPIL .
EBNA-2 mutants unable to transactivate LMP ] are growth transformation incompetent .
Recent genetic experiments have begun to define EBNA-2 domains nonessential ( amino acids 200 to 234 ) or essential ( amino acids 19 to 115 or 148 to 324 ) for B-lymphocyte growth transformation ( 7 ; J. Cohen , unpublished data ) .
Acute transfection of pZip-EBINA2 , pZip-EB2NA2 , or pZip-E2d200-234 into BL30/P3HR-1 cells induced LMP1 expression ( Fig .

CAT assays of LMP promoter activity with or without EBNA-2 in BL30/P3HR-1 ( A ) and Louckes ( B ) cells .
Cells were cotransfected with vector control ( SGS , pZip ) or EBNA-2 ( SV-EBINA2 , pZip-EBINA2 ) without promoter ( pCAT ) , with SV40 promoter ( pSV2CAT ) , or with -512/+40 LMP ] promoter ( -512/ +40 LMPCAT ) CAT reporter constructs indicated above each lane .
The percent acetylation in panel A was 0.7 and 0.7 % for pCAT , 96.6 and 82.5 % for pSV2CAT , and 1.6 and 22.1 % for -512/+40 LMPCAT when cotransfected with SGS and SV-EBINA2 , respectively .
When cotransfected with pZip and pZip-EBINA2 in panel A , the percent acetylation was 0.9 and 1.3 % for pCAT , 72.8 and 96 % for pSV2CAT , and 3.0 and 13.5 % for -512/+40 LMPCAT , respectively .
In panel B , the percent acetylation was 0.7 and 1.0 % for pCAT , 31.0 and 48.7 % for pSV2CAT , and 3.1 and 15.9 % for -512/+40 LMPCAT when cotransfected with SGS and SV-EBINA2 , respectively .
immunofluorescence , there was comparable expression of EBINA2Z , EB2ZNA2 , EBNA-2d200-234 , and EBNA-2d148-324 ( data not shown ) .
Although as many strongly positive pZip-E2d19-115 cells could be detected , lower-level expression was difficult to evaluate by immunofluorescent staining because of its diffuse nuclear pattern .
To confirm that comparable levels were expressed from the EBNA-2 deletion mutant constructs , we immunoprecipitated EBNA-2 from the acute transfections sequentially after LMP1 .
Comparable levels of the 66-kDa EBNA-2d419-115 , 56-kDa EBNA-2d148-324 , and 80-kDa EBNA-20200-234 were detected in immunoprecipitations from the acute transfections ( Fig .
7B , lanes 3 , 6 , and 7 ) .
Thus , this limited deletion analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that EBNA-2 transactivation of LMPI1 is essential for EBV growth transformation .

DISCUSSION These experiments are the first demonstration that EBNA-2 is a necessary and sufficient transactivator of expression in B lymphocytes .
Previous experiments demonstrating normal LMP1 expression only after infection with EBNA-LP- and EBNA-2-expressing EBV strains were consistent with the hypothesis that EBNA-2 or EBNA-LP affects LMP1 expression ( 31 ) .
However , the relative contribution of EBNA-LP , EBNA-2 , or other EBV genes to LMP1 expression from these nonisogenic EBV strains could not be distinguished .
Molecular genetic recombinants restoring normal EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 genes to the P3HR-1 EBV strain more precisely implicated EBNA-LP or EBNA-2 in LMP1 expression ( 7 ) but did not allow for comparison with nonrecombinant viruses or discriminate between EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 effects .
In the current experiments , the EBNA-2 open reading frame expressed under control of heterolo- 3414 WANG ET AL .
gous promoters transactivated LMP1 from a small EBV DNA fragment , indicating that EBNA-2 in the absence of any other EBV genes is a transactivator of LMP1 expression .
Two deletions within the EBNA-2 open reading frame resulted in mutant EBNA-2 proteins which did not transactivate LMP1 , confirming the specific requirement for EBNA-2 .
Recently , Cordier et al .
( 8 ) reported that stable EBNA-2 expression in BL41/P3HR-1 cells did not induce LMP1 , whereas Abbot et al .
( 1 ) reported that stable EBNA-2 expression induced LMPI in both BL30/P3HR-1 and BL41/ P3HR-1 cells .
The reason for this discrepancy is unclear .
Different expression vectors and different EBNA-2 EBV DNA fragments were used in the two studies .
Moreover , since EBNA-2 and LMP1 both have significant effects on B-lymphocyte activation ( 1 , 8 , 46-48 ) , the precise culture conditions used to obtain stable EBNA-2-expressing clones may select for or against high-level EBNA-2 and LMP1 expression .
Our studies avoid potential bias introduced by prolonged culture , enable us to examine unequivocally the effects of single EBV genes in a number of EBV-positive and -negative cell lines , and allow us to further characterize both the EBNA-2 transactivating domains and the EBNA-2-responsive LMP1 DNA element .
While a posttranscriptional effect is not as yet formally excluded , the EBNA-2 effect is likely to be transcriptional .
The strongest evidence for this is that EBNA-2 increases steady-state LMP1 mRNA levels in Daudi cells and increases cat reporter gene expression when linked to the -512 to +40 LMP1 DNA sequences .
EBNA-2 had no significant effect on cat gene expression from the SV40 early promoter .
Therefore , a putative EBNA-2 posttranscriptional effect would have to depend on recognition of a cis element within the 0 to +40 LMP ] DNA sequence .
Other data consistent with EBNA-2 being a transcriptional transactivator include the following .
( i ) EBNA-2 is tightly localized to the cell nucleus ( 20 ) .
( ii ) The tissue and species specificity of the effect of EBNA-2 on LMP ] is similar to that of other viral or cellular transcriptionally active factors .
( iii ) The low transcriptional rate of LMP compared with EBNA transcription even in EBNA-2-positive cells and the relatively high LMP1 mRNA levels in such cells ( 40 ) indicate that LMP ] expression could be stringently regulated at the transcriptional level .
( iv ) EBNA-2 also up regulates CD21 and CD23 cellular mRNAs ( 8 , 47 , 48 ) .
EBNA-2 can induce either the type a or type b CD23 mRNA , more compatible with an EBNA-2 effect on a CD23 transcriptional enhancer ( 48 ) .
Proof of an EBNA-2 transcriptional effect will require LMP1 nuclear runon assays in the presence or absence of EBNA-2 .
Further characterization and identification of the EBNA-2-responsive element within the -512 to +40 LMPL DNA will also clarify whether the responsive element is part of the regulatory sequences or the transcript .
It will be important to determine whether EBNA-2 also transactivates the expression of two recently identified LMP genes , LMP2A and LMP2B ( 25 ) .
LMP2A and LMP2B initiate within 3.0 kilobase pairs and 250 base pairs of the LMP1 transcriptional initiation site , respectively , and are transcribed in the opposite direction from LMPI1 ( 41 ) .
In fact , the LMP2B initiation site is within the -512/+40 LMP1 DNA shown to contain the EBNA-2-responsive element .
Although there are parallels between the effects of EBNA-2 on CD23 and LMP1 , there is a major difference in the effects of the EBV type 1 and type 2 EBNA-2s on these two genes .
In stable transfection experiments , EBV type 2 EBNA-2 has much less effect on CD23 and CD21 than EBV J. Viror .
type 1 EBNA-2 ( 48 ) , while in the acute transfection experiments reported here , EBV type 2 EBNA-2 had equal or greater effects on LMP1 transactivation .
Thus , the pathways by which EBNA-2 affects CD23 and LMP1l may differ to some extent .
The more potent growth phenotype of type 1 versus type 2 EBV in cell transformation ( 36 ) parallels the more potent type 1 EBNA-2 effects on CD21 and CD23 .
Indeed , B lymphocytes transformed with type 2 EBNA-2 recombinant P3HR-1 EBV express less CD23 , grow more slowly , and yet express similar LMP1 levels compared with isogenic cells transformed with type 1 EBNA-2 recombinant P3HR-1 ( 7 ) .
The differential effects of type 1 and type 2 EBNA-2s on CD23 and cell growth phenotype versus their similar effect on LMP1 indicate that EBNA-2 has significant functions not fully concordant with LMPI1 transactivation .
EBNA-2 could be similar to adenovirus E1A and SV40 T antigen in having direct effects on viral and cellular gene expression ( see references 24 and 30 for reviews ) , as well as other effects on cell growth which could also affect gene expression ( 10 , 50 ) .
A molecular genetic dissection of EBNA-2 may eventually reveal the distinct functional domains responsible for LMP1 and cellular gene transactivation suggested by these data .
In these preliminary studies , two deletions within EBNA-2 separated by 33 amino acids ( E2d419-115 and E2d4148-324 ) inactivated LMP1 transactivation and also inactivated growth-transforming ability , while another deletion ( E2d4200-234 ) which does not alter LMP1 transactivation retained growth-transforming capacity .
In light of the central role of LMP1 in EBV effects on B lymphocytes ( 46 , 48 ) , it is not surprising that transactivation might be essential for growth transformation .
However , EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP may not be sufficient for growth transformation , and we may also expect to define EBNA-2 domains which are necessary for growth transformation but are not necessary for LMPI1 transactivation .
These may define domains important for interaction with other cell transcriptional or growth-regulatory factors .
A major component of the action of EBNA-2 on B lymphocytes is mediated through LMP1 , which is a broad effector of B-lymphocyte growth and gene expression .
In three EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell lines , LMPA induces homotypic adhesion associated with increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules , characteristic profiles of B-cell activation antigens , and vimentin expression ( 3 , 46 , 48 ) .
In at least one B-lymphoma cell line , LMP1 also raises the intra-cellular free calcium level and alters transforming growth factor beta responsiveness ( 46 ) .
Thus , the biological impact of EBNA-2 is amplified by its transactivation of the LMP1-mediated growth effects .
The EBNA-2 effect can be further amplified by its synergistic interaction with LMPI1 as seen with CD23 induction ( 48 ) .
CD23 is prominently up regulated in EBV infection .
The type a CD23 mRNA is constitutively expressed in B lymphocytes , and the type b CD23 mRNA is preferentially turned on by LMPIL .
EBNA-2 can increase either CD23 mRNA form and acts synergistically when coexpressed with LMPI to induce high-level CD23 expression .
The effects of LMPI1 require expression at the level normally found in latent EBV infection ( 46 , 48 ) .
Thus , EBNA-2 regulation of LMP1 expression also underscores the central role for EBNA-2 in EBV-induced B-lymphocyte growth transformation .
Although EBNA-LP did not have any direct effects on LMP1 expression in these experiments , we can not rule out an indirect role for EBNA-LP .
Indeed , the linkage between EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 in bicistronic mRNAs suggests a Vor .
64 , 1990 need for joint expression ( 39 ) .
Since we used heterologous promoters for these studies , it is possible that EBNA-LP , or other viral genes , affect LMP1 expression indirectly through modulation of EBNA-2 expression .
