DonnELLy** *Division of Cytokine Biology , Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research , Food and Drug Administration , Bethesda , MD 20892 ; and TTularik , Inc. , South San Francisco , CA 94080 Edited by William E. Paul , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , and approved July 8 , 1999 ( received for review February 16 , 1999 ) ABSTRACT Interferons ( IFNs ) inhibit induction by IL-4 of multiple genes in human monocytes .
However , the mechanism by which IFNs mediate this inhibition has not been defined .
IL-4 activates gene expression by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation , homodimerization , and nuclear translocation of the latent transcription factor , STAT6 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 ) .
STATG6-responsive elements are characteristically present in the promoters of IL-4-inducible genes .
Because STAT6 activation is essential for IL-4-induced gene expression , we examined the ability of type I and type II IFNs to regulate activation of STAT6 by IL-4 in primary human monocytes .
Pretreatment of monocytes with IFN- or IFN-y , but not IL-1 , IL-2 , macrophage colony-stimulating factor , granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor , IL-6 , or transforming growth factor B suppressed activation of STAT6 by IL-4 .
This inhibition was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 and was not evident unless the cells were preincubated with IFN for at least 1 hr before IL-4 stimulation .
Furthermore , inhibition by IFN could be blocked by cotreatment with actinomycin D and correlated temporally with induction of the JAK/STAT inhibitory gene , SOCS-1 .
Forced expression of SOCS-1 in a macrophage cell line , RAW264 , markedly suppressed trans-activation of an IL-4-inducible reporter as well as IL-6- and IFN-y-induced reporter gene activity .
These findings demonstrate that IFNs inhibit IL-4-induced activation of STAT6 and STAT6-dependent gene expression , at least in part , by inducing expression of SOCS-1 .
The Th2-type cytokine IL-4 activates gene expression by binding to specific receptor complexes on the surface of IL-4-responsive target cells .
Type I IL-4 receptor complexes are heterodimers composed of the IL-4Ra chain ( p140 ) and the IL-2Ry chain ( y ) ( 1 , 2 ) .
Binding of IL-4 to these receptor complexes activates the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases , JAK1 and JAK3 , which then phosphorylate critical tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain ( ICD ) of the IL-4Ra chain ( 3-5 ) .
These phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the ICD of IL-4Ra provide docking sites for the latent cytosolic transcription factor , STAT6 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 ) ( 6 , 7 ) .
STAT6 binds to these docking sites via its SH2 ( Sre homology 2 ) domain and is , in turn , tyrosine-phosphorylated by the receptor-associated JAKs ( 8-10 ) .
Activated STAT6 then homodimerizes and translocates to the nucleus , where it binds with high affinity to STAT -binding elements ( SBE ) in the promoters of various IL-4 /IL-13-responsive genes .
IL-4 and IL-13 induce transcription of a distinct subset of genes in human monocytes , including FesRIIb ( CD23 ) ( 11 , The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

Type I IFNs ( IFN- « and IFN-B ) and type II IFN ( IFN-y ) inhibit IL-4 /IL-13-induced gene expression in monocytes and B cells .
For example , IFN-y suppresses IgE synthesis by IL-4-stimulated B cells ( 20-22 ) .
IFNs also inhibit IL-4-induced CD23 expression in both B cells ( 23 , 24 ) and monocytes ( 25 , 26 ) .
Furthermore , IFN-y inhibits IL-4- and IL-13-induced expression of 15-LO and IL-1ra in monocytes ( 13 , 14 , 27 ) .
Moreover , we have shown recently that IFN-B and IFN-y inhibit expression of the IL-1RI and IL-1RII genes in IL-4/ IL-13-stimulated monocytes ( 28 ) .
The mechanism by which IFNs inhibit expression of these genes has not been defined .
However , it is known that activation and nuclear translocation of STAT 6 is essential for induction of gene expression by IL-4 and IL-13 ( 29-31 ) .
IL-4/IL-13-response elements ( i.e .
, STAT6-binding sites ) are present in the proximal promoter regions of IL-4 /IL-13-inducible genes , including Is ( 32 ) , IL-1ra ( 33 ) , and IL-4Ra ( 34 ) .
The SBEs in the promoters of these genes are distinct from classical IFN-y activation sequences ( GAS elements ) because they contain an intervening four-base spacer instead of a three-base spacer between the palindromic TTC/GAA nucleotides .
This difference ( i.e .
, the presence of a four-base spacer instead of a three-base spacer ) makes these SBEs very selective for STAT6 ( 35 , 36 ) .
Consequently , other STAT proteins such as STAT1a , the principal IFN-inducible STAT , do not bind to these elements and can not compete with STAT6 for binding to these sites .
Because of this , we reasoned that IFNs must inhibit IL-4-inducible gene expression through some other mechanism .
In this report , we demonstrate that IFNs suppress IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT 6 in monocytes .
This inhibitory effect could be blocked by actinomycin D and correlated temporally with expression of the JAK/STAT inhibitory gene , SOCS-1 ( suppressor of cytokine signaling ) .
Moreover , forced expression of SOCS-1 in a macrophage cell line , RAW264 , markedly inhibited activation of an IL-4-inducible , STAT6-responsive reporter gene .
Thus , IFNs induce synthesis of a negative regulatory factor ( SOCS-1 ) that can suppress activation of STAT6 .
These findings define a mechanism by which IFNs can antagonize IL-4- and IL-13-inducible gene expression in human monocytes .

Cells .
Normal human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by elutriation in a Beckman JE-6B centrifugal elu-triator as described previously ( 37 ) .
The elutriated monocyte fraction consisted of > 95 % monocytes as determined by histologic staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) analysis with the anti-CD14 mAb Leu M3 ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Monocytes were cultured routinely at 4 X 10° cells per ml in complete medium in round-bottomed , polypropylene tubes .
The macrophage cell line , RAW264 , was obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) and cultured in complete medium .
Electrophoretic Mobility-Shift Assay ( EMSA ) .
Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from cytokine-treated cells by using a modification ( 38 ) of the original method described by Dignam et al .
( 39 ) .
A double-stranded oligonucleotide ( IL-1ra SBE1 ) based on a DNA sequence present in the promoter of the human IL-1ra gene was used as a probe in the gel-shift assays ( 33 ) .
This oligonucleotide contains an N4-type GAS element that can bind STAT6 but not STAT1a ( 33 ) .
Binding reactions were performed as described previously ( 38 ) .
A portion of each binding reaction mixture ( 8 pl per sample ) was electrophoresed on nondenaturing , 6 % polyacrylamide gels ( Novex ) by using 0.25 % TBE buffer ( 22 mM TrisHCl , pH 8.0/22 mM borate mM EDTA ) .
The gels then were dried and visualized by autoradiography .
Western Blots .
After cytokine treatment , the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco 's PBS , and cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described previously ( 38 ) .
Equal amounts ( 75 ug per sample ) of these extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on 8 % polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( Novex ) .
Immunoblot analysis was performed by using rabbit anti-phospho-STAT6 antibody or anti-STAT6 antibody at a final dilution of 1:1,000 in TTBS containing 3 % nonfat dry milk ( TTBs = 20 mM Tris , pH 7.6/137 mM NaQ/0.1 % Tween-20 ) .
The membranes were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) ( Amersham ) diluted 1:5,000 .
After washing , the membranes were incubated with the HRP substrate , SuperSignal ( Pierce ) .
STAT6 was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( Pierce ) .
Northern Blots .
Total RNA was isolated from cultured monocytes by the acid/guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/ chloroform extraction method as described previously ( 40 ) .
Equivalent amounts of RNA ( 10 ug per lane ) were size-fractionated by electrophoresis in 1 % agarose gels containing 0.66 M formaldehyde .
The RNA then was transferred onto Nytran membranes and cross-linked by exposure to UV light .
The membranes then were hybridized and washed according to standard procedures .
The SOCS-1 probe was a 724-bp Xbal fragment of a full-length murine SOCS-1 cDNA ( 41 ) .
Gel-purified insert DNA was radiolabeled by the random-primer method of Feinberg and Vogelstein ( 42 ) .
Construction of the SOCS-1 Expression Plasmids .
The SOCS-1 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Hiroyuki Mano ( 43 ) .
The Flag-tagged version of SOCS-1 was prepared Proc .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) - 10801 by PCR .
The full-length cDNA was amplified by using the following primers : 5¢-CGC GGG GGG ATC CTT GTA GCA CAC AAC CAG GTG GCA GCC-3 ' ( sense ) and 5'-GCG CCC GGA ATT CGG TCA AAT CTG GAA GGG GAA GGA GCT CAG-3 ' ( antisense ) .
The SOCS-1 mutant , bearing a single amino acid change in the SH2 domain ( R105A¥ ) , was generated by using two-step PCR cloning and the following primers : 5-GGC ACC TTC CTG GTG GCC GAC CAG CGG-3 ' ( sense ) and 5-CCG CTG GCG GCT GTC GGC CAC CAG GAA GGT GCC-3 ' ( antisense ) .
The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of a peDNA3 derivative carrying a Flag epitope tag .
The integrity of the DNA fragments was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis .
Transfections .
The IL-4-responsive reporter construct , C/EBP-N4 , has been described previously ( 44 ) .
The IL-4 response element in this construct is derived from a sequence in the promoter of the human Ig heavy chain germ-line & gene that contains adjacent binding sites for C/EBP and STAT6 ( 44 ) .
Transient transfections were performed by using the DEAE-Dextran method as described previously ( 44 ) .
Briefly , 1 x 10° RAW264 cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 100 ug/ml DEAE-dextran solution , 10 ug of the IL-4 luciferase reporter , and 10 pg of the SOCS-1 expression plasmids ( wild type or mutant ) or vector control for 1 hr at 37°C .
DMSO was added at a final concentration of 10 % for 1 min .
This medium then was washed off and replaced with fresh medium .
Each transfection was carried out in triplicate .
Eighteen hours after transfection , the cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-4 for 6 hr .
Luciferase activity was measured by using luciferase assay kits obtained from Promega .
Luciferase units were normalized to the amount of total protein .
RESULTS IL-4 Activates STAT6 in Human Monocytes .
Expression of IL-4-inducible genes is regulated , in part , via activation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 ( 29-31 ) .
To examine the effects of IFNs on STAT6 activity , we used an oligonucleotide probe derived from a DNA sequence in the promoter of the human IL-1 receptor antagonist gene ( 33 ) .
This probe , denoted SBE1 , contains a GAS-like sequence that binds STAT6 with high affinity , but does not bind other STAT proteins such as STAT1a or STAT3 ( 33 ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , nuclear extracts from IL-4-stimulated monocytes generated a single DNA-binding complex when coincubated with radiolabeled SBE1 probe ( Fig .
1 , lane 2 ) .
This IL-4-inducible DNA-binding activity was inhibited competitively by cold SBE1 or GRR oligonucleotides , but not by equivalent amounts of NF-KB or AP-1 oligonucleotides .
The IL-4-inducible DNA-binding activity also could be supershifted by an anti-STAT6 antibody ( Fig .
1 , lane 14 ) but not by an anti-STAT1a « antibody ( Fig .
1 , lane 15 ) or an antibody directed against an unrelated transcription factor , C/EBP ( Fig .
1 , lane 13 ) .
IFN-B and IFN-y Inhibit Activation of STAT6 by IL-4 .
IFN-8 and IFN-y inhibit induction of several genes by IL-4 in human monocytes ( 13 , 14 , 25-28 ) .
To determine whether IFNs and/or other cytokines can inhibit activation of STAT6 by IL-4 , we pretreated monocytes for 1 hr at 37°C with a panel of cytokines that included IFN-B , IFN-y , IL-1 $ , IL-2 , macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) , granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , IL-6 , and transforming growth factor B ( TGF- ) .
IL-4 then was added , and the cultures were incubated for an additional 30 min .
At the end of the incubation period , the cells were harvested and nuclear protein extracts were prepared .
The extracts then were assayed for STAT6 activity by EMSA by using radiolabeled IL-1Ra SBE1 probe .

IL-4 induces STAT6 activity in human monocytes .
Monocytes ( 4 X 10° cells per ml ) were incubated at 37°C in the presence { Jane 2 ) or absence ( lane 1 ) of recombinant human IL-4 ( rhIL-4 ; 10 ng/ml ) for 30 min .
The cells then were harvested , and nuclear protein extracts were prepared .
The nuclear extracts then were assayed by EMSA using radiolabeled IL-1ra SBE1 probe .
In lanes 3-10 , 5 ug of the nuclear extract from IL-4-stimulated monocytes ( lane 2 ) was preincubated with a 10- or 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled SBE1 , GRR , NF-kB , or AP-1 oligonucleotide .

Furthermore , the ability of IFN-y to inhibit IL-4-induced STAT6 activity was dose-dependent and demonstrable when IFN-y was used at a final concentration of 10 or 1 ng/ml ( Fig .
2 , lanes 11-15 ) .
Inhibition of STAT6 Activation by IFNs Is Transcription-Dependent .
To determine whether the inhibition by IFN is mediated by a gene that is newly transcribed , we tested whether actinomycin D could block inhibition of STAT6 activity by IFN-y .
As shown in Fig .
3 Top , pretreatment with IFN-y suppressed induction of STAT6 activity by IL-4 in control cells ( Fig .

Inhibition of IL-4-induced STAT6 activity by IFN-y is abrogated by the transcription inhibitor , actinomycin D. Monocytes ( 4 x 108 cells per ml ) were preincubated with medium alone or IFN-y ( 10 ng/m ! )

The nuclear and cytosolic protein extracts also were analyzed by immu-noblotting with rabbit anti-P ( Y ) -STAT6 ( Middle ) and rabbit anti-STAT6 ( Bottom ) antibodies , respectively .

Inhibition of STAT6 Activity by IFN Is Temporally Associated with Expression of the SOCS-1 Gene .
Temporal analysis of the effect of IFN-y on IL-4-induced STAT6 activity showed that the cells need to be preincubated with IFN at 37°C for at least 60 min before IL-4 stimulation ( Fig .
44 ) .
More complete inhibition was attained when cells were preincubated with IFN for 90-120 min .
As shown in Fig .
4B , reduced STAT6 DNA-binding activity was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 as determined by immunoblot analysis of the nuclear and cytosolic protein extracts using rabbit anti-P ( Y ) -STAT6 and anti-STAT6 Abs , respectively .
The SOCS genes constitute a family of cytokine-inducible , SH2-containing proteins that inhibit JAK/STAT-dependent gene expression ( 41 , 45 , 46 ) .
One of these genes , SOCS-1 ( also known as JAB or SSI-1 ) , is rapidly inducible by multiple cytokines , including type I and II IFNs , in the leukemic murine myeloid cell line M1 ( 41 , 47 ) .
To determine whether this gene is IFN-inducible in human monocytes , we treated monocytes with IFN-y ( 10 ng/ml ) for 0-2 hr and then measured SOCS-1 mRNA levels by Northern blotting .
As shown in Fig .
4C , IFN-y induced SOCS-1 expression in these cells .
Peak levels of SOCS-1 mRNA occurred approximately 90 min posttreat-ment .
The appearance of SOCS-1 mRNA in monocytes correlated temporally with the suppression of IL-4-induced STAT6 activity ( Fig .
4 4 and B ) .
Furthermore , as shown in Fig .
5 , analysis of the ability of multiple cytokines to induce SOCS-1 gene expression in monocytes demonstrated that only those cytokines that induced SOCS-1 expression ( i.e .
, IFN-B and IFN-y ) inhibited IL-4-induced activation of STAT6 ( Fig .
2 ) .
To determine whether forced expression of the SOCS-1 gene in a myeloid cell line can suppress IL-4-inducible promoter activity , we transfected the macrophage cell line , RAW264 , with an IL-4-inducible reporter gene , C/EBP-N4 , in the presence or absence of a wild-type or mutant SOCS-1 expression plasmid .
We then measured reporter gene activity 6 hr after stimulating these cells with IL-4 .
The reporter gene used to assess IL-4 responsiveness contains a prototypical N4 STAT6-binding site ( 44 ) .
As shown in Fig .
64 , IL-4 induction of control RAW264 cells transfected with the reporter gene alone resulted in a 42-fold increase in basal luciferase activity .
In contrast , these levels were diminished markedly ( ~84 % Immunology : Dickenshects et al .

To determine whether forced expression of SOCS-1 in RAW264 cells also inhibits activation by other cytokines that utilize the JAK /STAT signaling pathway , we cotransfected the SOCS-1 expression construct together with a reporter gene ( IRF-1-Luc ) that can be activated by either IL-6 or IFN-y .
As shown in Fig .

activation of this reporter gene by both IL-6 and IFN-y .
Therefore , once expressed , SOCS-1 can inhibit signal trans-duction mediated via multiple cytokine receptors .
DISCUSSION Type I and type II IFNs inhibit expression of several IL-4/ IL-13-inducible genes in monocytes , including CD23 ( 25 , 26 ) , 15-lipoxygenase ( 13 , 14 ) , IL-1ra ( 27 ) , IL-1RI , and IL-1RIH ( 28 ) .
The promoter regions of these genes contain functional STAT6-binding sites through which IL-4 and IL-13 induce ( or amplify ) their expression .
The present studies were conducted to determine the mechanism ( s ) by which IFNs suppress IL-4-and IL-13-inducible gene expression in primary human monocytes .
We found that pretreatment of monocytes with type I or II IFNs inhibits IL-4-induced activation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 .
Inhibition of STAT6 activation required preincubation with IFN for at least 1 hr and could be blocked by actinomycin D. Furthermore , the onset of inhibition correlated temporally with expression of the JAK/STAT inhibitory gene , SOCS-1 .
Moreover , forced expression of SOCS-1 in the macrophage cell line , RAW264 , markedly suppressed IL-4-induced trans-activation of a STAT6-dependent reporter gene .
These findings define a mechanism by which IFNs may suppress expression of multiple IL-4 genes .
A family of genes known as the SOCS or SSI ( STAT -induced STAT inhibitor ) genes recently has been identified ( 41 , 45 , 46 ) .
The proteins encoded by these genes are relatively small molecules ( 20-40 kDa ) that can interact physically via their central SH2 domains with either phosphotyrosine residues in the JAK kinases and/or the intracellular domains of certain cytokine receptors and , thereby , inhibit cytokine-induced STAT activation and STAT-dependent gene expression .
We considered whether inhibition of IL-4-induced STAT6 activity by IFNs might be mediated via the induction of one or more of these genes .
Recent studies have shown that SOCS-1 expression in the leukemic murine myeloid cell line M1 can be markedly up-regulated by treatment with various cytokines , including IFNs ( 47 ) .
In addition , both type I and type II IFNs have been shown to induce SOCS-1 expression in murine bone marrow stem cells ( 41 ) .
However , to date , no published studies have examined whether IFNs can induce SOCS gene expression in primary human cells .
We found that IFN treatment induces high levels of SOCS-1 expression in monocytes and that expression of this gene coincides with decreased STAT6 activity .
Inhibition of STAT6 activity by IFNs required that the cells be preincubated with IFN- or IFN-y for at least 60 min before IL-4 stimulation .
More complete suppression was attained when monocytes were preincubated with IFN for 90-120 min .
This lag period appears to be necessary for de novo expression of SOCS-1 .
Inhibition could be blocked by actinomycin D , demonstrating that it is newly transcribed .
In normal resting cells , the SOCS proteins do not exist as preformed latent molecules in the cytosol .
However , their expression can be induced rapidly by multiple cytokines , including type I and type II IFNs ( 41 , 47 ) .
We found that IFN-8 and IFN-y induce high levels of SOCS-1 expression in monocytes and that induction of SOCS-1 mRNA coincides with the suppression of IL-4-induced STAT6 activity .
Other cytokines such as IL-1 , IL-2 , M-CSF , GM-CSF , IL-6 , and TGF-B did not induce SOCS-1 mRNA and did not inhibit IL-4-induced activation of STAT6 .
Forced expression of the SOCS-1 gene in the macrophage cell line , RAW264 , markedly inhibited IL-4-induced trans-activation of a STAT6-responsive reporter gene .
Thus , IFNs inhibit IL-4-induced STAT6 activity and STAT6-dependent gene expression , at least in part , by inducing SOCS-1 gene expression .
Although preincubation of monocytes with IFNs suppressed IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 , decreased Proc .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) STAT6 phosphorylation actually may be a secondary consequence of decreased JAK1 activity .
JAK1 is constitutively associated with the intracellular domain of the IL-4Ra « chain in both type I and type II IL-4R complexes , and both IL-4 and IL-13 induce tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 ( 3-5 ) .
Furthermore , studies have shown that JAK1-deficient cell lines are unable to transduce IL-4-mediated signals ( 5 , 48 ) .
Although the precise mechanism by which SOCS proteins inhibit cytokine-induced signaling has not been fully defined , studies have shown that SOCS-1 can bind via its SH2 domain to the tyrosine kinase domain ( JH1 domain ) in all four JAKs and , thereby , inhibit their activity ( 45-47 ) .
It is likely , therefore , that IFN-induced SOCS-1 targets primarily JAK1 and that phosphorylation of STAT 6 is decreased only as a secondary consequence of decreased activation of JAK1 .
Unfortunately , IFN-B and IFN-y themselves induce tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 , so it is difficult to determine directly whether IL-4-induced JAK1 activity is decreased in IFN-treated monocytes because the basal levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK1 are elevated significantly by IFN pretreatment .
However , a recent report showed that stable expression of SOCS-1 in the murine B cell line , M12 , markedly inhibits IL-4-induced activation of JAK1 ( 49 ) .
The ability of IFNs to antagonize IL-4- or IL-13-induced STAT6 activity is not limited to monocytes because we have found that IFN-B and IFN-y also inhibit activation of STAT6 in fibroblasts .
These findings demonstrate that this inhibitory pathway is inducible in both hematopoietic and nonhemato-poictic cells and may be a common mechanism by which IFNs can antagonize IL-4- and IL-13-induced signaling in multiple cell types .
Studies have shown that IFN-y can inhibit IL-4-induced proliferation by Th2-type T cell clones ( 50 ) .
In addition , a number of earlier reports showed that pretreatment of primary B cells or B cell lines with type I or II IFNs inhibits IL-4-induced Ig isotype switching to IgE ( 20-22 ) .
A functional STAT6-binding site is present in the proximal promoter region of the Is gene , and binding of activated STAT6 to this site is essential for IL-4-induced gene expression ( 44 ) .
Furthermore , recent studies show that IFN-y also inhibits activation of STAT6 in certain B cell lines ( 49 , 51 ) .
It is possible , therefore , that this is also a mechanism by which IFNs inhibit IgE synthesis in B cells .
Further characterization of the molecular basis by which IFNs inhibit STAT 6 activity may aid in the future development of specific inhibitors of STAT 6 .
Such compounds might be very useful as therapeutic agents for treating diseases characterized by elevated IL-4 and IL-13 levels , particularly atopic disorders .
This hypothesis is supported by recent reports showing that STAT6 knock-out mice are highly resistant to bronchoalveolar challenge with allergens that are known to induce IL-4 and IL-13 activity ( 52 , 53 ) .
It is noteworthy that a recent study showed that thymocytes from SOCS-1 knock-out mice exhibit exaggerated IL-4-induced STAT6 activity ( 54 ) .
These findings as well as those described in this report suggest a critical role for SOCS-1 in counterregulating STAT 6 activity .
The ability of type I and type II IFNs to induce SOCS-1 gene expression provides a mechanism to explain how IFNs can suppress activation of IL-4- and IL-13-inducible genes .
