Identification of Two Novel Regulatory Elements within the 5'-Untranslated Region of the Human 4y-Globin Gene* ( Received for publication , January 18 , 1995 , and in revised form , March 27 , 1995 ) Persis J. Amroliat§ , John M. Paul Ney| , Arthur W. Nienhuist , and Stephen M. From the { Division of Experimental Hematology and the Department of Biochemistry , St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital , Memphis , Tennessee 38101 , the Department of Pediatrics , University of Tennessee , Memphis , Tennessee 38101 , and the **Bone Marrow Research Laboratory , Royal Melbourne Hospital , Parkville Victoria , 3050 , Australia Interaction between the stage selector element ( SSE ) in the proximal y-globin promoter and hypersensitivity site 2 in the locus control region partly mediates the competitive silencing of the B-globin promoter in the fetal developmental stage .
We have now demonstrated that a second SSE-like element in the 5'-untranslated region of the y-gene also contributes to this competitive silencing of the B-gene .
Utilizing transient transfection assays in the fetal erythroid cell line , K562 , we have shown that the core enhancer of hypersensitivity site 2 can preferentially interact with the proximal y-promoter in the absence of the SSE , completely silencing a linked B-promoter .
Mutation of a 20-base pair sequence of the y-gene 5'-untranslated region ( UTR ) led to derepression of B-promoter activity .
A marked activation of y-promoter activity was also observed with this muta-tion , suggesting the presence of a repressor , Fine mutagenesis dissected these activities to different regions of the 5'-UTR .
The stage selector activity was localized to a region centered on nucleotides +13 to +15 .
Electromobility shift assays utilizing this sequence demonstrated binding of a fetal and erythroid-specific protein .
The repressor activity of the 5'-UTR was localized to tandem GATA-like sites , which appear to bind a complex of two proteins , one of which is the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 .
These results indicate that the 5'-UTR of the y-gene contains sequences that may be important for its transcriptional and developmental regulation .
The normal developmental program of the human B-globin locus is characterized by two switches in gene expression : from embryonic ( e ) to fetal ( *y and *y ) beginning in the 5th week of gestation and from fetal to adult ( B and 8 ) during the perinatal period .
This developmental program is governed by a diverse array of regulatory mechanisms ( 1 ) .
Cis-acting elements within or immediately flanking the genes themselves can confer tissue and temporal specificity in transgenic mice , but the levels of expression are low ( 2-4 ) .
High level expression is restored when the genes are linked to the locus control region ( LCR ) , a * Supported in part by Cancer Center Support CORE Grant P30 CA 21765 , NHLBI , National Institutes of Health , Program Project Grant PO1 HL 53749-01 , American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities , the Wellcome Trust , and NHMRC Project Grant 940573 .

* The abbreviations used are : LCR , locus control region ; SSE , stage regulatory region 6-20 kilobases 5¢ of the e-globin gene that is characterized by four erythroid-specific DNase 1 hypersensitivity sites ( 5 , 6 ) .
This enhanced expression is achieved without disruption of the temporal regulation of the e- and y-genes , which appear to be autonomously silenced ( 7 , 8 ) .
In contrast , the increase in B-gene expression mediated by the LCR is accompanied by expression throughout development .
Restoration of B-gene expression confined to the adult developmental stage is only achieved when the y-gene is linked in the normal configuration ( 9-11 ) .
These results suggest that competition between the genes for LCR sequences is essential for appropriate regulation of the B-gene .
The concept of competition between globin gene promoters for a shared enhancer as a mechanism of developmental regulation was originally proposed for the chicken globin locus .
In this system , silencing of the embryonic e-globin gene in the adult stage of erythropoiesis is mediated by a sequence in the B-promoter , the stage selector element ( SSE ) ( 12 ) .
An erythroid and developmentally specific protein , NF-E4 , appears to facilitate the preferential interaction between the chick B-promoter and enhancer by binding to both regions and establishing a protein bridge that brings these two elements into apposition ( 13 ) .
In the human B-globin cluster , we have identified an analogous SSE in the proximal y-promoter .
This sequence fosters a preferential interaction between the y-promoter and hypersensitivity site 2 ( HS2 ) of the LCR in the fetal stage of erythropoiesis , thus silencing a linked B-promoter ( 14 , 15 ) .
As with the chicken SSE , the ability of this element to confer a competitive advantage to its promoter is dependent on the binding of a developmentally specific protein , the stage selector protein ( SSP ) .
The SSP is a heteromeric complex consisting of a ubiquitous transcription factor , CP2 , and a fetal/erythroid-specific partner protein ( 16 ) .
CP2 has recently been demonstrated to represent the human homologue of chicken NF-E4 ( 16 ) .
Although numerous protein footprints have been demonstrated in HS2 , the site of interaction with the SSE is un-known .
HS2 contains a core enhancer element that binds the transcription factors NF-E2/AP-1 , LCRF-1 , and NRF-2 ( 17-19 ) .
Additional cis-acting elements located 5 and 3 ' to the core enhancer have also been defined .
These sites , known as co-enhancers , bind the transcriptional regulators Sp1 , GATA-1 , USF , and YY1 and contribute to high level expression in stable transfectants and transgenic mice ( 20 , 21 ) .
In the studies delineated here , we sought to determine whether the core enhancer of HS2 was sufficient in isolation for the preferential selector element ; UTR , untranslated region ; PCR , polymerase chain reaction ; HS2 , hypersensitivity site 2 ; SSP , stage selector protein ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; bp , base pair ( s ) ; EMSA , electromobility shift assays .
12892 Novel Regulatory Elements in the y-Globin 5'-UTR interaction between HS2 and the y-promoter .
Our results define a novel SSE-like element in the 5'-untranslated region ( 5'-UTR ) of the y-globin gene , which appears to preferentially interact with this enhancer in the presence of a developmentally specific protein and thus contribute to the competitive silencing of the B-gene in the fetal stage of erythropoiesis .
We have , in addition , identified a separate negative regulatory element in this region .
MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA Construction-pUC007 , a pUC-based plasmid ( 17 ) , was used as the vector in all constructs .
Constructs containing the B-globin promoter ( -385 to +38 ) subcloned 5 ' of the coding sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene ( BCAT ) and the y-promoter ( -260 to +35 or -85 to +85 ) subcloned 5 of the firefly luciferase gene ( yLUC or -35yLUC ) have been previously described ( 14 , 17 ) .
HS2 was subcloned as a 734-bp HindIII-Bg/lI fragment into the HindIII-BamHI fragment of pUCO007 .
The XAkol-Aatll fragments of BCAT and yLUC were subcloned 3 ' of HS2 into a Sall-Aatll fragment ( HS2BCAT , HS2yLUC ) .
A synthetic HS2 ( HS2* ) containing the tandem NF-EZ % / AP-1 sites flanked by neutral DNA was constructed by PCR .
The HS2 `` retains the spacing between the core enhancer and the adjacent promoter but lacks all the previously reported co-enhancer footprints .
Neutral sequences were designed to be devoid of consensus sequences for known transactivators of the LCR .
Initially , a 163-bp Xhol-HindIII PCR product of the pBR322 backbone and a 189-bp BgilI-Sail PCR product of the pBR322 ampicillin resistance gene were subcloned 5 ' and 3 ' to the 46-bp enhancer core in pUCOO07 ( 22 ) .
An additional 370-bp BamHI-Sall PCR product of the pBR322 tetracycline resistance gene was subcloned 3 ' to retain the natural spacing .
The entire HS2Y was released as a Sail-ActII fragment and subcloned 5 ' of either BCAT or yLUC ( HS2YBCAT , HS2YyLUC ) using the XAol/Sall-AafII strategy outlined above .
Dual promoter constructs linking the B- and -260y-promoter ( HS28CATyLUC , HS2 `` 8CATyLUC ) or the B- and -35y-promoters ( HS2BCAT-35yLUC , with their respective reporter genes were obtained using the same strategy .
Oligonucleotides and Site-directed Mutagenesis-Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems synthesizer model 380B using phosphoramidite chemistry and purified on Sephadex G-25 columns ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc. ) .
Prior to use in gel mobility shift assays , complementary strands were annealed in 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 50 mM NaCl , and 10 mm MgCl , by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and slow cooling to room temperature .
PCR site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described ( 23 ) .
Briefly , mutants were made by PCR in 2 halves incorporating a Psfl restriction site at the 3'-end of one and the 5'-end of the other .
Products were cleaved with PstI , ligated with T4 DNA ligase , and the full-length mutant amplified by PCR using the external primers .
Once subcloned into plasmids , the sequence was verified by the chain termination method with Sequenase ( U. S. Biochemical Corp. ) .
Cell Lines and Nuclear Extracts-Human erythroleukemia ( K562 ) cells , murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) , and HeLa cells were grown in improved minimal essential medium ( Biofluids ) with 10 % fetal calf serum and 50 pg/ml gentamicin .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described ( 14 ) .
DNA Transfection and Transient Assays-Plasmid DNA was prepared over double cesium chloride gradients .
3.5 x 10° K562 cells were mixed with equimolar amounts of the test plasmids in the presence of carrier plasmid ( pUC 9 ) to a total of 50 ug .
Electroporation was performed with a Bio-Rad gene pulser apparatus at 960 microfarads and 0.2 kV .
After transfection , cells were grown in the presence or absence of 20 uM hemin , and each sample was split in two and harvested after 48 h. Cell lysates from one half were prepared by repeated freeze-thaw cycles and assayed for CAT activity as described ( 24 ) .
The remaining half was lysed with Triton X-100 , and luciferase activity was measured on a Monolight 2001 luminometer ( Analytical Luminescence Laborato-ries ) .
The assay was linear from 10* to 10 `` light units ; samples above or below this were reassayed with appropriate dilution .
CAT activities were standardized for lysate protein concentration .
Luciferase lysates had equivalent protein levels .
In our previous studies , we had demonstrated that inclusion of an internal control reporter plasmid was unsuitable in dual promoter constructs ( 14 ) .
Standard single promoter constructs were used as experimental controls , and constructs were only compared within the same series of experiments .
Results shown represent at least six different transfections with two independent plasmid preparations in induced cells .
Similar trends were observed in 12893 separate transfections of uninduced cells .
Statistics were calculated using Student 's ¢ test ; values of p < 0.05 were considered significant .
RNase Protection Assay-80 ug of total RNA was prepared from K562 cells 48 h after electroporation using RNAzo !
B ( Tel-Test , Friends-wood , TX ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Probes were constructed by subcloning XAol-BamHI PCR fragments containing the -35y-wild-type or mutant promoters and the first 243 bp of the luciferase coding sequence into the XAhol-BgilI fragment of pSP73 .
Sequence integrity was verified by dideoxy sequencing .
High specific activity radiolabeled transcripts were generated with SP6 RNA polymerase .
The predicted length of protected fragments from correctly initiated transcripts was 284 bp .
RNase protection assays were performed as described ( 25 ) , and samples were electrophoresed on an 8 % sequencing gel .
Gel Mobility Shift Assay-Assays were performed with 10° cpm of probe added to a 20-4l reaction containing varying amounts of nuclear extract , 500 ng of poly [ d ( GC ) ] , 6 mm MgCl , , 16.5 mM KCI , and 100 ug of bovine serum albumin ( 26 , 27 ) .
For competition assays , a 150-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added with the probe .
In antibody studies , 3 wl of pre-immune serum or rat or rabbit anti-mouse GATA-1 antibody ( kindly provided by Merlin Crossley and Stuart Orkin , HHMI , Childrens ' Hospital , Boston ) were preincubated for 10 min with the binding reaction prior to addition of the probe .
After incubation at 4°C for 10 min and 25°C for 20 min , samples were electrophoresed on a 4 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 x Tris-borate-EDTA buffer for 90 min at 10 V/em .
RESULTS The Preferential Interaction between the Core Enhancer of HS2 and the y-Promoter Is Not Dependent on the SSE-The erythroid-specific enhancer in HS2 has been mapped to a 46-bp fragment consisting of tandem NF-E2/AP-1 binding sites ( 17 , 22 ) .
In our initial experiments , we sought to determine whether this minimal enhancer was sufficient to preferentially interact with the y-promoter when in competition with the B-promoter in a fetal erythroid environment .
A 734-bp HindIII-Bgill fragment of HS2 and a synthetic HS2 ( HS2Y ) containing the 46-bp enhancer flanked by neutral DNA to retain the spacing between the enhancer and adjacent promoter but ablating all reported protein binding sites were compared .
Initially , each HS2 fragment was linked to the -378 B-promoter with a CAT reporter gene or the -260 y-promoter with a luciferase reporter gene and transfected into K562 cells .
With the y-promoter , reporter gene activity was 4-fold higher in the context of HS2 than ( data not shown ) .
This presumably reflects the effect of positive regulatory elements in HS2 outside the core , which we refer to as co-enhancers .
By contrast with the B-promoter , reporter gene activity was equivalent with HS2 and HS2~ in K562 cells ( Fig .
1 , constructs 1 and 4 ) .
To determine if the core enhancer was sufficient for the competitive advantage of the y-promoter in the fetal environment , the -378 B-promot-er/CAT reporter gene and -260 y-promoter/luciferase reporter gene were linked in competition for HS2 or HS2Y ( HS2BCATyLUC , HS2YBCATyLUC ) and transfected into K562 cells .
Constructs linking the HS2 fragments to the B-pro-moter/CAT reporter hybrid served as controls .
As seen in Fig .
1 , B-promoter activity in the dual promoter constructs was diminished 10-fold compared with the controls with both HS2 and HS2Y ( p < 0.05 ) , indicating that the minimal enhancer was sufficient to allow preferential interaction of HS2 with the y-promoter ( constructs 2 and 5 ) .
The reduction in y-promoter activity observed in construct 5 by comparison with construct 2 is consistent with the loss of the co-enhancer effect .
To determine if the interaction between the y-promoter and the core enhancer was dependent on the SSE , we truncated the y-promoter to -35 relative to the transcriptional start site and examined the effect in dual promoter constructs in the presence of HS2 and HS2 .
The residual y-promoter contained the 35 nucleotides 5 ' to the cap site and an additional 35 nucleotides of 5'-UTR .
In the context of the wild-type HS2 , truncation of the y-promoter resulted in a marked decrease in its activity , 12894 Novel Regulatory Elements in the y-Globin 5-UTR A FiG .

Luciferase Activity ( x 10 `` RLU/p1 ) presumably due to loss of upstream regulatory elements ( Fig .
1 , construct 3 ) .
Loss of the SSE in this setting resulted in derepression of the linked B-promoter ( p < 0.01 ) ( Fig .
1 , construct 3 ) .
However , the level of B-promoter activity observed in this construct was significantly less than the activity seen when the B-promoter was linked to the same HS2 fragment in isolation ( Fig .
1 , construct 1 ) , suggesting that residual competitive sequences may be present .
This was confirmed with the construct linking HS2* `` to the BCAT/-35yLUC cassette ( Fig .
1 , construct 6 ) .
In this setting , the -35y-promoter totally retained its competitive advantage , and the linked B-promoter was sup-pressed .
These findings led us to postulate the existence of alternative stage selector-like elements that interact specifically with the HS2 core enhancer within the proximal y-promoter .
Localization of an Alternate Stage Selector Element in the 5'-UTR of the y-Globin Gene-To further localize the sequences in the -35y-promoter responsible for its competitive advantage in attracting the core HS2 enhancer , scanning mutagenesis of this region was performed .
The ability of mutants to compete with a linked B-promoter for interaction with HS2Y `` was tested in K562 cells .
As seen in Fig .
2 , construct 2 , mutation of the y-TATA box ( -85y `` `` ) totally abolished y-activity .
Despite this , no derepression of the linked B-promoter was seen , implying that the competitive advantage of the -35y-promoter was independent of its transcriptional activity .
Mutation of the sequences between the TATA box and the CAP site decreased -35y-promoter activity slightly but had no effect on repression of a linked B-promoter ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , mutation of the 5'-UTR ( -35y `` `` , Fig .
2 , construct 3 ) led to a 3-fold derepression of B-promoter activity ( p < 0.05 ) , suggesting that this area contained a competitive element capable of preferentially attracting the HS2 core enhancer .
In addition to the derepression of the B-promoter , the 20-bp 5'-UTR mutant also resulted in a concomitant 7-fold increase in y-promoter activity ( p < 0.05 ) , suggesting that this mutation might also have disrupted a separate negative regulatory element .
To further evaluate this repressor activity , the wild-type and mutant -35y-promoters were linked to the HindIII-Bg { ll fragment of HS2 as single promoter constructs and transfected into K562 © 1 -S ___L__ © -n- T__ ] [ ] ] Luciferase CAT 1.5 1.0 0.5 ( 6r/aucd® % ) Anandy 0.0 cells and the murine adult erythroid cell line , MEL .
In both cell lines , the wild-type promoter was less active than the mutant , and a comparable degree of repression was observed in each , indicating that this effect was not developmentally specific ( data not shown ) .
To evaluate the contribution of the 5'-UTR SSE-like element to the suppression of a linked B-promoter in the context of larger y-promoter and HS2 fragments , the 20-bp mutation was made in the -260y-promoter , and the ability of this mutant to silence a linked B-promoter in competition for the 734-bp HindllII-Bglll HS2 enhancer was tested .
As shown in Fig .
3 ( construct 2 ) , with the larger HS2 , loss of the UTR SSE resulted in a significant derepression of B-promoter activity ( p < 0.05 ) despite the presence of an intact y-promoter SSE .
As previously shown , loss of the y-promoter SSE by truncation to -385 ( construct 3 ) resulted in a significant derepression of linked B-activity ( p < 0.05 ) .
In the absence of the y-promoter SSE , mutation of 5'-UTR ( construct 4 ) led to a more marked derepression of B-promoter activity than that seen with construct 3 ( p < 0.05 ) .
This suggests that the two SSE regions function cooperatively .
As with the core enhancer , mutation of the 5'-UTR also led to activation of -35y-promoter activity ( p < 0.05 , construct 4 ) .
This effect was less pronounced in the setting of the -260y-promoter ( construct 2 ) , suggesting that upstream elements in the y-promoter can compensate for the repressor activity of this region .
To dissect the sequences in the 5'-UTR responsible for the SSE and repressor functions , a series of smaller mutants spanning this area were made and tested for their ability to compete with a linked B-promoter for the HS2Y enhancer .
As shown in Fig .
4 ( constructs 1 and 2 ) , mutation of the sequence from +13 to +15 ( -857y `` ° ) resulted in a significant derepression of linked B-promoter activity without reduction in y-activity ( p < 0.01 ) .
No other mutant demonstrated any B-promoter derepression ( data not shown ) .
This suggested that the nucleotides from +13 to +15 may represent the important contact bases for a protein mediating the SSE-like effect .
It should be noted that this mutation introduced a different sequence between +13 and +15 than the 20-bp mutant , making it unlikely that the effect is specific to the mutant sequences .

These nucleotides are centered on a tandem inverted binding motif for the erythroid transcription factor , GATA-1 .
These results suggested that the y-globin 5'-UTR contains two distinct regulatory elements , one analogous to the SSE and another that functions as a repressor .

B , EMSA of wild-type and mutant downstream 5'-UTR probes with crude K562 , MEL , and HeLa nuclear extracts ( lanes 1-3 and 9 ) and extracts from untransfected COS cells ( Zane 7 ) or COS cells transfected with a GATA-1 expression vector ( lane 8 ) .
Competition experiments were performed with K562 extract preincubated with non-radiolabeled GATA probe competitor ( lane 4 ) , pre-immune serum ( lane 5 ) , or anti-mouse GATA-1 antibodies ( lane 6 ) .
specificity of this complex , wild-type and mutant probes were used to assay nuclear extracts from adult erythroid ( MEL ) and non-erythroid ( HeLa ) cell lines ( Fig .
6 , lanes 3-6 ) .
Binding activity of the uppermost complex was absent in these extracts , suggesting that this complex is both fetal and erythroid spe-cific .
Neither a highly purified preparation of SSP or recombi-nant CP2 bound to the wild-type UTR 1 probe ( data not shown ) .
To evaluate protein binding to the repressor sequence in the 5'-UTR , a probe spanning nucleotides +10 to +42 ( UTR 2 ) was used in the EMSA with extract derived from K562 , MEL , and HeLa cells .
As seen in Fig .
7 , two retarded species were observed with all extracts .
However , the broad lower complex contained a distinct erythroid-specific component in MEL and K562 extract ( lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Mutation of the tandem inverted GATA motifs with activity in functional assays ( UTR 2M ) abolished binding of both the upper ubiquitous band and the erythroid-specific band ( Fig .
7 , lane 9 ) .
To determine whether the erythroid-specific band was due to binding of GATA-1 , an excess of an unlabeled probe consisting of 6 repeats of the GATA motif or anti-mouse GATA-1 antibodies were added to the reaction mixture .
As seen in Fig .
7 , both the unlabeled competitor ( lane 4 ) and anti-mouse GATA-1 antibody ( lane 6 ) significantly reduced the binding of the erythroid complex without altering the ubiquitous band .
Preimmune sera nonspecifically diminished both bands to a minor degree ( Zane 5 ) .
The diminution in GATA-1 binding observed with this antisera was comparable with that observed by other investigators . ``
To further validate that the erythroid complex consisted of GATA-1 , nu 2 M. Crossley , personal communication .
clear extract from COS cells transfected with a GATA-1 expression vector and extract from untransfected COS cells was studied with the UTR 2 probe .
As seen in lanes 7 and 8 , the GATA-1 containing extract produced a single retarded band , which comigrated with the erythroid-specific band seen with K562 extract .
No complex was observed with untransfected COS extract .
These results suggest that the repressor element of the 5'-UTR binds two proteins , one of which is GATA-1 .
DISCUSSION Although the promoter elements of the human globin genes have been exhaustively studied , little is known about the role of the untranslated leader sequences of these genes .
We now report the presence of two novel elements in the 5-UTR of the y-gene , which appear to have differing transcriptional activi-ties .
The first element , localized to a region centered on nucleotide +14 , functions as an alternate stage selector by directing preferential interaction of the erythroid enhancer of HS2 to the y-gene in a fetal erythroid environment .
The second element represses y-promoter activity in both fetal and adult stages of erythropoiesis .
Both of these effects appear to be mediated by specific DNA binding proteins .
We have previously shown that the competitive advantage of the y-promoter in the fetal stage of erythropoiesis is mediated in part by the SSE in the proximal y-promoter ( 14 ) .
We now demonstrate that a second element in the 5'-UTR ( SSE-2 ) also contributes to the preferential interaction of HS2 with the y-promoter .
SSE-2 is distinct from the y-promoter SSE in that its function is unrelated to the binding of the SSP but correlates with the binding of a second fetal/erythroid-specific protein , which we refer to as the UTR stage selector protein .
12898 Phylogenetic footprint analysis suggests that the binding site for this protein is conserved in species with a distinct fetal stage of y-gene expression ( 30 ) .
This observation is analogous to the phylogenetic footprint data observed with the SSE , suggesting that both factors may be integral for the competitive silencing of the B-promoter in the fetal stage of erythropoiesis .
Examination of the binding motif of the UTR stage selector protein reveals no obvious similarities with known consensus sequences , and thus the identity of this factor is yet to be determined .
Our studies lead us to propose a model whereby the 2 stage selector elements function by stabilizing the interaction between looping upstream regulatory sequences of the LCR and the transcriptional machinery of the y-promoter .
SSE-2 appears to stabilize the interaction with the core enhancer .
This effect may be mediated by an interaction between UTR stage selector protein and the enhancer protein rather than an effect on the transcription initiation complex , since capture of the core enhancer can occur in the absence of transcription ( Fig .
2 , construct 2 ) .
We have recently demonstrated that the SSE in the proximal y-promoter may function by recruiting co-enhanc-ers outside the HS2 core . ``
In the presence of large fragments of HS2 , the 2 stage selector elements may function additively ( Fig .
3 ) .
In this context , loss of the proximal promoter SSE destabilizes the loop , and preferential interaction with the y-promoter is lost ( 14 ) .
However , our studies with the HS2 core enhancer suggest that loss of the SSE in this setting induces less instability and compensation by the 5 ( -UTR SSE occurs ( Fig .
1 ) .
The observation that even when both stage selector elements are removed from the y-promoter , linked B expression does not achieve the levels seen with the single B-promoter construct .
This suggests that loss of the SSEs negates the competitive advantage of the y-promoter , and the two promoters now compete equally for HS2 .
The co-incident derepression of y-promoter activity with both the 20-bp and smaller UTR mutants suggests that a repressor element also exists in the region .
In contrast to the effect of SSE-2 , which must be at the level of transcription since it affects a separate gene transcript , the repressor effect could be either transcriptional or secondary to a translational block or altered mRNA stability .
However , we have observed that the fold increase in y-promoter activity observed with the mutant was mirrored by a similar increase in mRNA levels ( Fig .
5 ) and that the magnitude of this effect was independent of assay time .
Additional support for a transcriptional mechanism comes from the observation that binding of the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 and a second ubiquitous factor was integral for repressor activity .
Although we have no evidence to differentiate which of these factors is mediating this effect , GATA-1 has previously been demonstrated to transcriptionally repress y-gene expression when binding to the non-canonical ( C/T ) AAG motif at -117 in the y-promoter ( 31 ) .
The function of the 5-UTR has been demonstrated in viral and eukaryotic genes as centering predominantly on translational control ( 32-35 ) .
However , transcriptional activity of this region has also been demonstrated ( 36 ) .
Sequences downstream of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 promoters have been shown to influence basal transcription secondary to binding of the transcription factor LBP-1 ( 37 ) .
In eukaryotes , the Drosophila heat shock gene , Asp22 , is transcriptionally regulated by a small region between the cap site and nucleotide +14 ( 38 ) .
Similarly , the human gastrin gene appears to be transcriptionally respon- ° P. J. Amrolia and S. M. Jane , unpublished observations .
Novel Regulatory Elements in the y-Globin 5'-UTR sive to the leader sequence ( 89 ) .
The role of the 5'-UTR in globin gene regulation remains virtually unexplored .
The tran-seriptionally active sequences reported here suggest that regulation of the y-gene and the competitive balance between the y- and B-genes may be influenced by this region and the proteins that bind to it .
Although the relative importance of these elements in the setting of the entire cluster remains to be elucidated , the previous identification of both the human and chicken stage selector elements in similar assays provides precedent for their usefulness .
