6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; Regulation of IL-6 Synthesis in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells by C3a and C3aq , , Argl Wolfgang H. Fischer , `` `` Mark A. Jagels , `` and Tony E. Hugli* The anaphylatoxin C3a has been reported to have immunomodulatory effects on a number of different cell types .
In this study we investigated the effects of C3a and C3a , , , , , , , on gene expression and protein secretion of IL-6 in human PBMCs , either alone or in combination with LPS or IL-1 .
C3a or C3a , , , , , , .
, alone exhibited no effect on the expression or secretion of IL-6 .
However , when PBMC were stimulated with LPS or IL-1 $ , both C3a and C3a , , , , , , were found to enhance IL-6 release by PBMC in a dose-dependent manner .
Since C3a has been shown to induce PGE , production by monocytes , and PGE , has been shown to influence cytokine production , we investigated the potential role of PGE , in CJa-mediated enhancement of LPS- and IL-1 { 3-induced IL-6 production .
Indomethacin blocked PGE , release , but had no influence on the observed effects of C3a , suggesting that the effects of C3a on IL-6 production are independent of PGE , formation by monocytes .
Northern blot analysis showed that C3a as well as C3a , , , , , , , enhanced LPS-induced mRNA levels for IL-6 .
Pretreatment of PBMCs with pertussis toxin blocked the functions of C3a and C3a , , , , , \ , .
, , indicating that the actions of these two molecules are mediated by a G protein-coupled pathway .
Furthermore , we investigated the effects of C3a and C3a , , , , , , on induction of NF-B and activating protein-1 binding .
Both molecules enhanced LPS-induced NF-B and activating protein-1 binding activity .
These results demonstrate the capacity of intact C3a and its circulating des-Arg form to exert immunmodulatory effects in vitro .
ctivation and/or dysregulation of the complement sys-A tem has been shown to be involved in several clinical situations , such as sepsis ( 1 , 2 ) , burn injury ( 3 ) , adult respiratory distress syndrome ( 4 ) , and autoimmune diseases ( 5 ) .
Activation of the blood complement system via either the classical or alternative pathways results in the production of one or more of the anaphylatoxins , i.e .
, C3a , C4a , and/or C5a ( 6-8 ) .
C5a , the best characterized of the anaphylatoxins , is a potent proinflammatory mediator that induces chemotactic migration , increases ox-idative metabolism and the release of lysosomal enzymes in leu-kocytes , stimulates the release of numerous inflammatory mediators including histamine and cytokines , and enhances cellular adhesion ( 8-12 ) .
C3a also possesses proinflammatory proper-ties , which overlap with CSa in a number of activities .
C3a is spasmogenic , induces the release of PGE , from human macro-phages , induces degranulation and chemotaxis of eosinophils , and is one of the most effective chemotactic mediators yet identified for human mast cells ( 13-16 ) .
Very recently , we demonstrated a direct irmnmunmodulatory effect of C3a ( as well as C3a , , , , , , ) on human tonsil-derived resting B lymphocytes ( 17 ) .

Copyright © 1999 by The American Association of Immunologists The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 162 : 453-459. been shown that C3a and C3a , , , , , , , can regulate TNF-a and IL-1 synthesis in LPS-stimulated human PBMC ( 15 ) .
The immune system is essential for protection of the host organism from microbial invasion , tumorigenesis , and environmental insult .
This task requires concerted actions of cellular responses that are regulated by a complicated network of cytokines , other humoral factors , and cell-cell interactions .
Inflammatory cytokines , including TNF-a , IL-1 $ , IL-8 , and IL-6 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases that are also associated with complement activation .
Like TNF-a and IL-1 , IL-6 is a pleiotropic mediator produced by numerous cell types in response to a variety of stimuli , including LPS , platelet-derived growth fac-tor , and the cytokines TNF-a , IL-1 , and IL-2 ( 18-21 ) .
IL-6 is known to promote differentiation and maturation of B lympho-cytes , to augment T lymphocyte responses , to stimulate hemopoi-esis , and to induce the production of acute phase proteins ( 22 , 23 ) .
Increased serum levels of IL-6 have been reported in patients with a variety of diseases , including acute bacterial infections , menin-gcoccal septic shock , systemic lupus erythematosus , Castleman 's disease , rheumatoid arthritis , and AIDS ( 24 , 25 ) .
The effects of CS5a on cytokine production are well character-ized .
We and others have demonstrated that C5a is a potent inducer of gene expression and protein synthesis for TNF-a , IL-1 , IL-6 , and IL-8 ( 10-12 , 26 ) .
On the other hand , the characterization of C3a as an inducer of cytokine production has just begun .
It is the purpose of the present study to further explore the mechanism ( s ) by which C3a and C3a , , , , , , influence immune and inflammatory responses .
C3a and C3a , .. , , , were assessed for their ability to modulate LPS- and IL-1B-induced IL-6 production in human PBMC cultures .
In this report we show that C3a as well as C3a_ , _ , a , , are potent modulators of IL-6-specific mRNA and protein synthesis in human PBMCs .
Our results suggest that C3a and C3aq .
, a , , contribute to both inflammation and the regulation of immune function by modulating IL-6 , which possesses potent pleiotropic functions .

Results C3a and C3aj ... , , enhance LPS- and IL-1B- induced IL-6 release from human PBMCs Recently , we and others have demonstrated immunmodulatory effects of C3a and C3a , , , .~ , , on cytokine synthesis in human PBMCs and human tonsil-derived B lymphocytes ( 15 , 17 ) .
These studies prompted us to investigate whether C3a and can modulate the production of a related cytokine , i.e .
, IL-6 , under various experimental conditions .
Unstimulated human PBMCs or PBMCs stimulated with 1 uM C3a or C3a , , , , , , alone did not release detectable levels of IL-6 ( Fig .
1 ) .
However , at concentrations from 1 uM to 10 nM , both C3a and C3a , , , , , , enhanced LPS-induced IL-6 release from human PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner .
At a concentration of 1 M , C3a and C3a , , , , , , Significantly increased IL-6 levels in culture supernatants of PBMCs stimulated with LPS ( 100 ng/m ! )
by 400 + 30 and 328 + 19 % , respectively ( Fig .

At a concentration at or below 10 nM , neither C3a nor m-duced a significant increase in IL-6 .
We next asked whether the observed increase in IL-6 production by C3a and 18 Specific for LPS stimulation or whether activation of cells by other stimuli ( ie .
, IL-1B ( 25 ng/m !

310 + 40 and 293 + 38 % , respectively .
Surprisingly , but in agreement with former studies , C3a , , .
, \ , , was almost as effective as C3a itself ( 15 , 17 ) .
However , at a concentration of 500 nM an apparent difference was observed between C3a and C3a , , , , , , that was not observed at other concentrations .
To prove that the observed increases in IL-6 production were specific effects of C3a and C3a , , , .
, , , and not due to contaminants in the C3a preparations used in our experiments , we tested the synthetic C3a analogue peptide 71/53 ( peptide sequence WWGKKYRASKLGLAR ) .
Previous studies have shown that this peptide exhibits the same biological activities as native C3a ( 13 , 30 ) .
PBMCs were stimulated with LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) and different concentrations of C3a analogue 71/53 .
As shown in Fig .
2 , the peptide analogue was also found to increase LPS-induced IL-6 production in a dose-dependent manner .
The concentration of C3a analogue peptide required to produce approximately the same enhancement was 5-10 times higher than that of native human C3a .
This is in agreement with former studies of this peptide ( 30 ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that the observed enhancing effects of C3a on IL-6 production in PBMCs are specific effects of the molecule .
C3a and C3aj..a , , enhance LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA levels in human PBMCs To investigate whether the effects of C3a and C3a,4 , ,4 , , on IL-6 are accompanied by increased IL-6 mRNA levels , PBMCs were stimulated with LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) plus 1 wM C3a or and RNA was prepared for Northern blotting .
A time course from 0-24 h demonstrated that neither C3a nor C3a , , , , , , alone can induce IL-6 mRNA in PBMCs ( data not shown ) .
However , when cells were stimulated with both LPS plus C3a or C3a , , , .
, , , , we found an increase in IL-6 mRNA at 3 h compared with that in cells stimulated with LPS alone ( Fig .
3 ) .
Standardization of IL-6 mRNA levels to B-actin mRNA levels revealed that IL-6 mRNA increased by 60 and 63 % , respectively , for C3a and C3a , , , , , , costimulated with LPS .

These data demonstrate that the observed effects of C3a and C32,4 , , , , , are NOt mediated via the production of endogenous PGE .
C3a- and C3a , , , , , , - mediated increases in IL-6 production in LPS- or IL-1B-stimulated PBMCs are pertussis toxin ( PTX ) sensitive C3a is known to bind to a receptor that is functionally coupled to G proteins ( 32 , 33 ) .
In addition , cloning of the human C3a receptor confirmed that it possesses a structure typical of a G protein-coupled receptor .
Therefore , we addressed the question of whether the observed effects of C3a and C3a , _. , , , are subject to inhibition by PTX .
Pretreatment of cells with PTX is known to interfere with signals mediated through G ; -type guanine nucleotide binding pro-teins .
Our results shown in Fig .

These results are representative of three independent experiments using different donors .
Induction of the transcription factors NF- « B and activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) by C3a and Previous reports indicated that the NF-B binding site located between positions -72 and -63 on the IL-6 gene is important for the induction of IL-6 ( 34 , 35 ) .
Another important transcription factor involved in the regulation of IL-6 transcription is AP-1 , with a consensus binding sequence found at position -283 to -277 in the IL-6 promoter ( 36 ) .
To examine whether the observed enhanced responses seen after costimulation of PBMCs with LPS and C3a were related to a different induction of the transcription factors NF- « B and AP-1 , we measured the DNA binding activity of these factors using EMSAs .
As expected , treatment of PBMCs with LPS ( 100 ng/m ! )
alone caused induction of NF-KB and AP-1 binding activities .
However , costimulation of PBMCs with LPS ( 100 ng/m ! )
and C3a ( 1 wM ) resulted in an additional increase in the binding activities of NF-KB and AP-1 ( Fig .
7 ) .
Surprisingly , nuclear extracts from PBMCs stimulated with C3a ( 1 wM ) alone showed increased DNA binding activity compared with the activity in untreated cells ( Fig .
8 ) .
To verify that these DNA-protein interactions were specific , we performed competition experiments with unlabeled oligonucleotides .
NF-KB and AP-1 binding activities in nuclear extracts from PBMCs stimulated with LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) plus C3a ( 1 uM ) were completely abrogated in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides , but remained intact in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of Oct-1 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
9 ) .
These results indicate that the enhancing effects of C3a are associated with an increased binding activity of the transcription factors NF-KB and AP-1 .

Discussion Involvement of anaphylatoxins in the processes of inflammation and immunoregulation is supported by well-established phenomena ( 8 , 9 ) .
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the molecular basis for the biological effects of C3a and C384 , ,4 , , On human PBMCs .
The effects of C3a on cytokine synthesis are poorly defined .
A previous report demonstrated that C3a stimulated human PBMCs to produce IL-1 ( 37 ) .
However , another study failed to show IL-1 synthesis in PBMCs in response to C3a ( 38 ) .
Regarding C3a as an inducer of cytokine synthesis , this latter finding is in agreement with our results as well as other published data ( 15 ) .
Neither C3a nor C3aq , , , , , induced IL-6 specific mRNA or release of IL-6 in human PBMCs .
Although rapid expression of cytokine mRNA in monocytes can be induced by adherence without subsequent translation , C3a or C3a , , , , , , alone did not induce or modify IL-6 mRNA synthesis in our in vitro model .
However , here we demonstrate that C3a as well as C32 , , , , , , increase IL-6-specific mRNA and protein synthesis by human PBMCs after stimulation with LPS or IL-1 .
The C3a analogue peptide 71/53 also enhanced IL-6 release , suggesting that the observed effects of C3a are specific .
Recently , Takabayshi et al .
reported that C3a and C3aq , , a , , modulate LPS-induced mRNA and protein synthesis of TNF- « and IL-1 in human PBMCs ( 15 ) .
In their study they showed that synthesis of these cytokines was up-regulated in adherent PBMCs , whereas they were down-regulated in nonadherent PBMCs .
Very recently , these studies were extended to demonstrate the same effects on IL-6 production ( 39 ) .
In our study we did not observe a difference between adherent and nonadherent PBMCs , independent of the concentration of LPS employed ( data Competitor Competitor NF-B Oct-1 AP-1 Oct-1 0 100x 100 % B 0 100x 100 % - » ﬂ * .

It is currently unclear what differences in our experimental systems are likely to account to the discrepancies in these studies .
In a recent study we demonstrated C3a-induced down-regula-tion of IL-6 and TNF-a release in human tonsil-derived B lymphocytes ( 40 ) .
Taken together , these findings suggests that C3a can modulate cytokine synthesis in a cell-specific manner .
Similar effects have been reported for other mediators , such as IL-4 , which is known to inhibit IL-6 production in a tissue-specific manner ( 41 ) .
C3a is known to induce PGE , production in human monocytes , leading to increased cAMP levels by stimulation of adenylate cy-clase activity .
These signals are known to regulate cytokine production .
In our experiments indomethacin , an inhibitor of cyclo-oxgenase , totally suppressed PGE , production , but did not affect C3a- and C3a , __\ , , -mediated increases in IL-6 expression or release in human PBMCs .
This suggests that the effects of C3a and On IL-6 production in LPS- or IL-1 B-stimulated PBMCs are independent of endogenous PGE , synthesis .
These data are in agreement with those published by Takabayashi et al .
( 15 , 39 ) .
Recently , the receptor for human C3a was cloned and was found to belong to the family of seven-transmembrane receptors ( 32 , 33 , 42 ) .
Moreover , several biological responses of C3a can be blocked by PTX , suggesting that the C3a receptor acts as a G ; -coupled receptor ( 16 ) .
In the present study we show that the effects of both C3a and C3a , , , , , , , on IL-6 synthesis were totally blocked by PTX , indicating that these molecules act through a G protein-dependent pathway , possibly involving the C3a receptor .
However , the biological activity of C ; ,4 , , .a , g as well as the concentrations of C3a and required to elicit enhancement of IL-6 production are inconsistent with the currently known properties of the receptor on other cell types ( 33 , 50 ) .
Definitive assignment of a receptor-mediated mechanism currently awaits the generation of specific receptor antagonists or blocking Abs to the C3a receptor .
A number of previous studies have revealed that NF- « B and AP-1 are important transcription factors involved in the control and regulation of IL-6 transcription .
The major form of NF-KB is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 subunits that exist in the cytoplasm in an inactive form due to association with the specific inhibitor protein IB ( 43 , 44 ) .
Phosphorylation of IB by candidate kinases leads to the release and subsequent nuclear translo-cation of NF- « B , which then binds to a decameric DNA sequence originally identified in the x light chain enhancer of Ig ( 45 ) .
The transcription factor AP-1 is a heterodimer formed by a product of the fos and jun families ( 46 ) .
In the present study we show that the enhancing activities of C3a on IL-6 expression in LPS-stimulated PBMCs are associated with increased binding of NF- « B and AP-1 to their consensus sequences .
Unexpectedly , nuclear extracts from PBMCs stimulated with C3a alone also showed elevated DNA binding activities of NF- « B and AP-1 compared with those from untreated cells .
Despite this observation , C3a was not able to induce IL-6 expression .
Furthermore , in the studies by Takabayashi et al .
, C3a alone did not induce IL-1 B , TNF- « , or IL-6 ( 15 , 39 ) .
A possible explanation could be that other transcription factors shown to be important for IL-6 expression ( e.g .
, NF-IL-6 and SP-1 ) are not inducible by C3a ( 47 ) .
A study by Matsusaka et al .
( 48 ) showed that in the absence of NFE-IL-6 , NF- « B ( p50/p65 ) , or any other combination of p50 and p65 , IL-6 expression was not inducible in a cotransfection system .
These results indicate that a cooperative effect exists among these transcription factors ( 48 ) .
Recently , LeClair et al .
( 49 ) found that p50 and NF-IL-6 directly associate with each other via the b-Zip domain and the Rel ho-mology domain .
These data raise the possibility that C3a alone might be competent to induce the transcription of yet uninvesti- REGULATION OF IL-6 SYNTHESIS BY C3a gated genes by inducing binding activity of NF-KB and AP-1 .
To our knowledge , this is the first report showing that the anaphylatoxin C3a is capable of inducing activation of transcription factors , namely NF- « B and AP-1 , which have been shown to be important regulators of many immune response and acute phase response genes , including IL-8 , TNF-a , IL-1 $ , granulocyte CSF , Ig x light chain , and serum amyloid A-1 .
Therefore , it is possible that C3a is involved in the regulation of a number of immunological functions in vivo .
Surprisingly , C3a , , , , , , shared the ability to enhance IL-6 production with C3a .
which lacks the C-terminal arginine , has generally been regarded to be biologically inactive ( 13 , 14 , 50 , 51 ) .
is not chemotactic for eosinophils ( 13 ) , does not bind to specific receptors on guinea pig platelets ( 50 ) or on a human mast cell line ( 52 ) , and does not induce calcium mobilization in either human mast cells ( 52 ) or human monocytes ( 53 ) , all properties that have been demonstrated by the intact molecule .
Because the C-terminal arginine is rapidly cleaved by serum carboxypeptidase N to convert C3a to C3aq .
, , , , , this enzymatic process has been considered a major mechanism for controlling C3a function in vivo ( 51 ) .
However , recent studies have reported biological activities for C3a , , , , , , , including inhibition of cytotoxicity by human NK cells ( 54 ) , induction of histamine release from rat peri-toneal mast cells ( 55 ) , regulation of TNF-a and IL-1 in human PBMC ( 15 ) , and regulation of B cell function ( 17 ) .
Both C3a and C324 , , arg are highly cationic molecules that can bind to anionic components on the cell membrane , leading to nonspecific cell activation ( 55 ) .
This nonspecific effect , which depends on the net charge of the molecules , could explain why C3a , , , , , , and C3a share some biological activities .
There is also evidence that C3a ( and possibly binds to the -chain of the Fee receptor on mast cells ( 56 ) .
Similar Fc interactions on monocytes could influence the signaling induced by LPS .
However , the question remains as to why C3a , _. , , , activity is observed in some , but not all , cell types responding to C3a .
A possible explanation would be differences in the cell surface of these cell types .
An even more speculative possibility would be that there is a second receptor for C3a and/or C3a,4 , , , , , .
Two groups who have cloned the C3aR found a second band in their Northern blots supporting this possibility ( 33 , 42 ) .
Our findings that a synthetic peptide analogue of C3a mimics the effects of C3a and and that both the effects of C3a and C3a , , .
, , , are inhibited by PTX support a re-ceptor-mediated signaling pathway .
Nevertheless , more studies are necessary to identify receptor vs nonreceptor mechanisms of cellular activation by C3a .
Regardless of the mechanism , the enhancing effect of C3a/C3a , , , , , , on IL-6 production in LPS- and IL-1 B-stimulated PBMCs is readily demonstrated .
In conclusion , by influencing IL-6 production in B cells ( 17 ) and PBMCs , C3a and C3a , .. , , , may contribute to the regulation of both immune responses and inflammation .
To our knowledge , this is the first report showing a biological function of C3 @ Of C3 @ qesa ; $ that is associated with increased binding activities of the transcription factors NF-KB and AP-1 .
