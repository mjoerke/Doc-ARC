FOCUS ON HEMATOLOGY Interleukin-10 Inhibits Expression of Both Interferon a- and Interferon y-Induced Genes by Suppressing Tyrosine Phosphorylation of STAT1 By Satoshi Ito , Parsw a Ansari , Minoru Sakatsume , Harold Dickensheets , Nancy Vazquez , Raymond P. Donnelly , Andrew C. Larner , and David S. Finbloom Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) helps maintain polarized T-helper cells in a T-helper lymphocyte 2 ( Th2 ) phenotype .
Part of this process involves the prevention of the development of Th1 cells , which are a primary source of interferon y ( IFNy ) , a potent activator of monocytes and an inhibitor of Th2 proliferation .
Because monocytes and macrophages are important mediators of Th1-type responses , such as delayed-type hypersensitivity , we sought to determine if IL-10 could directly mediate inhibition of IFNy- and IFN « -induced gene expression in these cells .
Highly purified monocytes were incubated with IL-10 for 60 to 90 minutes before the addition of IFNy or IFN « .
IL-10 preincubation resulted in the inhibition of gene expression for several IFN-induced genes , such as IP-10 , ISG54 , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 .
The NTERFERON a ( IFNa ) has been shown to be therapeutically effective in the treatment of certain types of leukemias and lymphomas !
and in some solid tumors such as melanoma . ``
Although not used as frequently as IFN , IFNy has been shown to have some activity in renal cell carcinoma and is a major secretory product of T cells stimulated with interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) .4 Obviously , not all tumors respond to IFNs , and the effects of IFNs on cells can be modulated by many different agents .
A cytoplasmic protein is present in tumor cells that can block the formation of DNA-binding proteins that recognize the IFN-stimulated response element of IFN-induced genes . ``
T-cell cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) can also effectively block the ability of IFNs to activate monocytes , cells known for their ability to mediate cytotoxic effects against tumor cells . ``
Therefore , the effects that monocytes exert in any environment depend to a large extent on the type of T-cell cytokines present at the time they interact with other cells .
Immune responses mediated by monocytes and activated T cells can be divided into two types , based on the expression of groups of T-cell-derived cytokines . ``

0006-4971/99/9305-0120 $ 0.00/0 1456 reduction in gene expression resulted from the ability of IL-10 to suppress IFN-induced assembly of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) factors to specific promoter motifs on IFN « & - and IFNy-inducible genes .
This was accomplished by preventing the IFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 , a component of both IFN « - and IFNy-induced DNA binding complexes .
Therefore , IL-10 can directly inhibit STAT-dependent early response gene expression induced by both IFN « and IFNy in monocytes by suppressing the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 .
This may occur through the ability of IL-10 to induce expression of the gene , suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 ( SOCS3 ) .

polarized type or another is a useful tool to learn more regarding the immunologic basis of that particular disease .
A cellular immune response dominated by a T-helper lymphocyte 1 ( Th1 ) infiltration , in which IFNy and IL-2 predominate , is observed in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis® or inflammatory bowel disease . ``
'' This response generally evokes a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction .
Immune responses regulated by T-helper lymphocyte 2 ( Th2 ) cells result in the secretion of IL-4 and IL-10 .
This response is important for humoral immunity and mast cell development seen in such diseases as hyperimmuno-globulin E secretion syndrome .
It has been appreciated that cytokines secreted by Th2 cells can dramatically modulate the responses of cells involved in a Th1 immune response .
For example , IL-4 can modulate the expression of early response genes induced by IFN and IFNy . ``
Likewise , IFNy can affect the response of cells to IL-4 .
Whereas it is known that IL-10 can effectively block lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) activation of monocytes , ' `` its effects on direct IFN activation of genes are poorly understood .
IFNs and IL-10 bind to their cognate receptors and initiate a signal that results in the activation of Janus kinase ( Jak ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) proteins , leading to transcription of early response genes .
!
IL-10 activates Tyk2 , Jak1 , STAT1 , and STAT3 . ``
'' IFN activates Tyk2 , Jak1 , STAT1 , STAT2 , STAT3 , and STATS .
IFNy activates Jakl1 , Jak2 , STAT1 , and , in some cell lines , Although there is some overlap among the proteins activated by these three cytokines , there is no clear explanation from this information as to why one IFN or one IL should inhibit the action of others .
We hypothesized several years ago that GM-CSF could inhibit the expression of IFNy-induced genes by activating a new STAT protein that bound to the same y activation sequence ( GAS ) element as IFNy-induced STAT1 and thus prevent the induction of the FeyRI gene . ``
This protein was subsequently determined to be STAT5 .
Although it is well established that IL-10 can suppress LPS-induced responses , which are by and large driven by NFB , its direct effect on the ability of IFNa « and IFNy to activate cells by an NFB-independent mechanism is virtually unexplored .

IL-10 INHIBITS IFN SIGNALING inhibit the expression of specific sets of IFN response genes .
We show that IL-10 can suppress IFN-induced expression of several genes by inhibiting STAT 1 tyrosine phosphorylation .
In addition , we have gone on to show that IL-10 markedly upregulates expression of the SOCS3 gene , which is known to suppress cytokine activation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Monocytes .
- Human peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy donors were separated into a mononuclear cell fraction and then were subjected to countercurrent centrifugal elutriation .
The fractions enriched for monocytes were cultured in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ; GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) without serum for 45 to 60 minutes in 4-well tissue culture plates until adherent , washed , and then incubated with DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone , Logan , UT ) and gentamicin ( 50 ug/mL ) .
Cells prepared in this manner are greater than 95 % monocytes by morphology and staining for anti-CD14 .
Cells were incubated with recombinant human IL-10 ( rhuIL-10 ; Schering-Plough , Madison , NJ ) for 60 to 90 minutes before the incubation with IFNa ( Roferon ; Roche , Nutley , NJ ) or IFNy ( Genentech , South San Francisco , CA ) for the specified times .
RNAse protection assay .
- Steady-state levels of mRNA induced by either IFNa « or IFNy were measured by RNAse protection assay , as previously described .
'* For the assay , probes were constructed such that each lane of the gel contained several protected fragments .
y-Inducible gene-10 ( IP-10 ) , a chemokine with anti-angiogenesis properties , was linearized with Pvz II , which yielded a protected fragment of 360 bp . ``
ISG54 , a gene induced by IFNa ( and in monocytes by IFNy ) , was linearized with Pvu II , and this yielded a protected fragment of 367 bp . ``
Guanylate binding protein ( GBP ; an IFN- and IFNy-induced gene ) was linearized by Asp718.2 ' For an internal control for the amount of RNA loaded onto the gel , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ; linearized with Sau3a ) was used and had a protected fragment of 300 bp . ``
All hybridizations were performed overnight at 56°C .
The RNA was subjected to digestion with RNAse T1 , followed by separation on a 6 % polyacrylamide/urea sequencing gel , and analyzed by phosphorimager analysis and autoradiography .
Northern analysis .
- Total RNA was isolated from cultured monocytes by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method , as previously described . ``
'' RNA precipitates were pelleted by microcentrifugation and redissolved in 100 uL of diethylpyrocarbon-ate ( DEPC ) -treated sterile water .
Equivalent amounts of RNA ( 10 ug/lane ) were size-fractionated by electrophoresis in 1 % agarose gels containing 0.66 mol/L formaldehyde .
The RNA was then blotted by overnight capillary transfer onto Nytran membranes ( Schleicher & Schuell , Keene , NH ) and cross-linked by exposure to UV light .
The membranes were then prehybridized , hybridized , and washed according to standard procedures .
The SOCS3 probe was a 681-bp Miu I fragment of the full-length murine SOCS3 cDNA , ** kindly provided by Dr Douglas Hilton ( Walter and Eliza Hall Institute , Parkville , Australia ) .
Gel-purified insert DNA was radiolabeled by the random primer method of Feinberg and Vogelstein® `` to a specific activity of 10° epm/ug or greater .
Electrophoretic mobility assays ( EMSA ) .
EMSA using the y response region ( GRR ) of the FeyRI receptor were performed using either whole-cell extracts or nuclear extracts , as described previously .
`` * `` `` This element is similar to the GAS element found within many IFNy-induced genes .
This probe was also used for the study of IFNa-induced genes , in addition to the IFN-stimulated response element ( ISRE ) from the ISG15 gene , which is recognized by the ISGF3 complex and is specific for IFN-induced genes .
!
Immunoprecipitations .
After treatment with IL-10 and/or IFNs , monocytes were solubilized with 1 % TX100-containing buffer , incubated on ice for 15 minutes , and then centrifuged for 13,0008 for 12 1457 minutes to generate a postnuclear extract as described . ``
The postnuclear extracts were then incubated with anti-STAT1 antibodies .
The immunoprecipitates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) gels , transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane , and immunoblotted with antiphos-photyrosine .
Alternately , some extracts were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine-STAT1 ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) .
Immunoblots were developed using either horseradish peroxidase or enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) or nitroblue tetrazolium chemistry , respectively .
RESULTS We initially addressed the question of which early response genes induced by IFNs might be inhibited by IL-10 .
Studies with STAT1-deficient mice showed that induction of IP-10 is dependent on STAT1 activation . ``
'' The IP-10 gene encodes a chemokine of the cysteine-x-cysteine ( CXC ) type that is rapidly activated by IFNy and IFNa .
Recent data have shown that the IP-10 protein has strong anti-angiogenic properties and , in addition to inhibiting the development of carcinogenic tumors in several mouse models , has profound effects on chronic inflammatory conditions . ``
'' We initially examined the effect of IL-10 on the induction of IP-10 in monocytes exposed to IFNa « ( Fig 1A ) .
We observed rapid induction of IP-10 expression that was markedly inhibited by IL-10 at all concentrations of IFN « tested .
For some individuals ( such as the one shown ) , nearly complete inhibition could be observed .
Although the number of donors were only two per group , it was clear from the autoradiograph that at higher concentrations of IFN , there was less inhibition by IL-10 .
IFNy-stimulated IP-10 RNA expression was inhibited by pretreatment of monocytes with IL-10 ( Fig 1B ) .
At virtually all doses of IFNy , over a range that occupies approximately 10 % to 100 % of the receptors for IFNy , IL-10 suppressed IFNy-induced IP-10 RNA expression by 59 % to 68 % .
However , at the lower concentrations of IFNy , inhibition tended to be greater .
We went on to confirm that there was no change in receptor number of affinity by directly measuring the number of IFNy receptors on monocytes after IL-10 treatment ( data not shown ) .
In addition to IP-10 , we also examined IFN activation of ISG54 ( Fig 1C ) .
Although ISG54 was one of the first genes recognized as an IFN-inducible early response gene , virtually no information is available regarding the function of the protein that it encodes .
IFNa-stimulated ISG54 is entirely dependent on the assembly of a complex of transcription factors , including STAT1 , STAT2 , and p48 , that bind to the ISRE enhancer .
Prior incubation of monocytes with IL-10 resulted in IFNa-induced inhibition of the accumulation of ISG54 RNA , compared with incubation with IFNa alone ( Fig 1C ) .
The observed inhibition by IL-10 was greater when cells were incubated with submaxi-mal concentrations of IFNa « ( 49 % v 17 % ) .
There is some variability , and some donors clearly show inhibition of greater than 60 % .
Early reports discounted the ability of IFNy to induce the ISG54 gene because of the lack of a GRR sequence within its 5 regulatory region .
However , IFNy treatment of peripheral blood monocytes can clearly stimulate the accumulation of ISG54 RNA ( Fig 1D ) .
Incubation of monocytes with IL-10 showed a consistent suppressive effect on IFNy-stimulated ISG54 RNA expression to a similar extent as that observed for the IP-10 gene .
In many donors , the suppression reached levels From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Monocytes were treated with 10 ng/ mL of IL-10 for 60 minutes before treatment with the indicated doses of ( A ) IFN « or ( B ) IFNy for 90 minutes .
RNA was isolated from the cells , and RNAse protection assays were performed .

The arrow s indicate the protected gene fragment for ISGS54 and the control gene , GAPDH .
For all RNAse protection assays , the ratio of the values for the IFN-induced gene divided by those for the control ( GAPDH ) gene was computed , and for cells that had been pretreated with IL-10 followed by IFN .
The values were calculated from Phospho-Imager data analysis .
The percentage of inhibition was calculated by subtracting the values for cells treated with IL-10 from values for IFN-treated cells and dividing this number by the values for the cells treated with IL-10 and IFN .
The values under the gel represent the mean of 2 to 6 experiments + standard deviation at the various doses .
of greater than 90 % at lower doses of IFNy ( 1 ng/mL , in this experiment ; Fig 1D ) .
These concentrations of IFNy are generally at a level in which receptors are only 10 % occupied , but genes are maximally expressed . ``
In addition to IP-10 and ISG54 genes , we examined the ability of IL-10 to suppress the induction of several other IFN-inducible genes .
These genes included ICAM-1 and IRF-1 .
Although the IRF-1 gene has GAS elements that drive its transcription by IFNy , there was no perceptible inhibition by IL-10 in monocytes .
For ICAM-1 , only IFNy was capable of inducing its expression ; IFNa had no effect ( data not shown ) .
ICAM-1 expression is clearly important for immune cell adherence and tumor cell recognition . ``
'' For those experiments in which this gene had increased expression of at least fourfold after exposure to IFNy , pretreatment with IL-10 inhibited ICAM-1 RNA expression by 50 % ( over a range of IFNy concentrations of 0.25 to 10 ng/mL ; data not shown ) .
These results are consistent with a recent report describing the inhibitory effects of IL-10 on IFNy-induced ICAM-1 expression in monocytes . ``
Both IFN « and IFNy activate STAT 's , which activate gene expression by binding to ISRE and GAS elements in the promoters of IFN-inducible genes .
IFNy essentially activates only STAT1 in human peripheral blood monocytes , although one group has reported the activation of STATS in the histio-cytic lymphoma cell line , U937 .
`` ° IFNa can activate several STAT 's , including STAT1 , STAT2 , STAT3 , STAT4 , and STATS .
Multimers of these STAT 's bind to ISRE or GAS enhancers to facilitate gene transcription .
When we investigated the effect of IL-10 on the IFNa-induced formation of ISGF3 ( Fig 2A ) , we noted that there was a clear dose response with respect to IFNa concentrations , such that at 100 U/mL ( 0.5 ng/mL ) of IFN , From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

EMSA analysis of IFN « -induced DNA binding complexes .
Monocytes were treated with 10 ng/mL of IL-10 for 90 minutes , followed by treatment with the indicated doses of IFNa for 30 minutes .
Nuclear extracts were prepared , and EMSA were performed .
( A ) EMSA using the ISRE probe , which represents binding of the ISGF3 complex .
( B ) Summaries of the Phospho-Imager data from several experiments , such as those presented in ( A ) , were quanti-tated using the Phospho-Imager .
The value given is the mean + standard deviation .
( C ) EMSA using the GRR probe , which predominantly measures binding of STATA dimers .
inhibition by IL-10 was greater than 90 % , yet at 1,000 U/mL of IFNa , inhibition by IL-10 had decreased to approximately 35 % ( Fig 2B ) .
This result suggested that formation of ISGF3 was markedly inhibited by IL-10 at lower doses of IFNa .
However , higher doses of IFNa could overcome to some extent this inhibition by increased receptor occupancy , suggesting that there may be a limiting amount of an inhibitory component induced by IL-10 whose function can be competed for when more IFNa binds to the cell .
The addition of exogenous p48 to the reactions did not affect the ability of the complex to bind to the ISRE probe ( data not shown ) .
When a similar experiment was performed using the GRR probe , which is recognized by STAT1 dimers , the same result was observed ( Fig 2C ) .
Because 1459 binding to the GRR probe probably occurs through a mechanism different from that to the ISRE ( ie , neither p48 nor STAT2 is involved ) , this result implies that STAT1 may potentially be a target of IL-10 suppression .
We next examined the effect of IL-10 on IFN « activation of STAT1 directly through the use of an antibody that recognizes only the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of STAT1 ( Fig 3A ) .
IL-10 pretreatment of monocytes resulted in reduced levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 when cells were treated with lower doses of IFNa ( 200 U/mL or lower ) .
This result correlated with IL-10-mediated inhibition of IFN-induced gene expression and formation of ISGF3 .

1460 of IL-10 on STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig 3A , lanes 5 and 6 ) , such that at 1,000 U/mL ( 5 ng/mL ) , inhibition was still present , but reduced to approximately 40 % ( Fig 3C ) .
This was consistent with the results observed for gene induction and ISRE binding .
Pretreatment of cells with IL-10 also suppressed the ability of IFNy-stimulated STAT1 dimeric complexes to bind to the GRR probe ( Fig 4A , lane 3 v 4 ) .
There was no evidence of IL-10-stimulated STAT binding to the GRR probe , because the time of treatment with IL-10 ( t = 90 minutes ) before IFNy was sufficient for this binding to have dissipated .
Under these conditions , IL-10 inhibited IFNy activation of GRR-binding complexes at several concentrations of IFNy ( Fig 4B ) .
The inability to repeatedly scan the same exact region in EMSA autoradiographs from different experiments leads to the variation observed in the plot .

IL-10 INHIBITS IFN SIGNALING molecular weight STAT1 ( Fig 5A , asterisk ) were markedly decreased by IL-10 pretreatment ( Fig 5A , lower panel ) .
Because the preincubation of monocytes with vanadate , a phosphotyrosine phosphatase ( PTP ) inhibitor , had no effect on IL-10 inhibition ( data not shown ) , it is unlikely that SHP1 , a PTP , induces the effects of IL-10 .
Moreover , because only tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 translocates to the nucleus , a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation implies an IL-10 event must occur at the receptor .
Again , we observed a dose-response effect of the inhibition , such that at higher doses of IFNy , the suppressive effects of IL-10 were much less evident ( Fig 5B ) .
However , in most inflammatory conditions , IFNy concentrations are generally low , and the inhibitory effect of IL-10 is marked at concentrations of 1 ng/mL , in which activation of genes is generally at a near maximal level .
Recently , a series of genes have been cloned that are known to inhibit cytokine-induced activation of cells .
`` * `` `` To determine if IL-10 induced the expression of any of these genes , we treated cells with IL-10 and isolated RNA for Northern blot analysis .
The results of this analysis showed that IL-10 could rapidly ( within 30 minutes ) induce the expression of the SOCS3 gene and maintain its expression for at least 120 minutes after the addition of IL-10 ( Fig 6 ) .
The kinetics of this induction of SOCS3 gene expression by IL-10 were consistent with its potential role in counterregulating IFN-induced STAT1 activation and IFN-induced gene expression .
In preliminary experiments , we found that IL-10 did not upregulate expression of the related genes , CIS-1 , SOCS-1 , or SOCS-2 , in monocytes ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION IL-10 suppresses the ability of LPS to elicit increases in mRNA of IL-1 , tumor necrosis factor , IL-6 , and other cytokines or cytokine receptors . ``
In some of these studies , it has also been shown that the ability of IFNy to enhance the effects of LPS can also be suppressed by IL-10.4 `` However , there has been no study addressing whether IL-10 inhibits IFNy- and IFN-stimulated early response genes in monocytes .
Both IFN « and IFNy induce the expression of these genes by activating STAT proteins that bind to either GAS or ISRE enhancers . ``
In this report , we showed that IL-10 can inhibit the induction of IFN-induced genes by preventing the assembly of ISGF3 and + IL-10 poo -- - -- -0 _ 30 60 90 120 : time ( min . )

The suppression of gene expression correlates with the IL-10-induced inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 , which is required for this protein to bind DNA .
Moreover , we have shown that the SOCS3 gene is induced by IL-10 and may be involved in the suppression of STAT1 phosphorylation .
IL-10 has numerous effects on hematopoietic cells , but most notable is its association with the development of Th2 lympho-cytes .
The polarization of T-cell development is thought to progress from a ThO phase to either a Thl or Th2 cell , depending on the presence or absence of various ILs.4 IL-10 is secreted by Th2 cells , and once secreted , it plays a major role in inhibition of monocyte/macrophage function , thereby suppressing the Th1 phenotype . ``
Like IFNs , IL-10 activates STAT complexes .
`` `` `` `` `` 34 Incubation of monocytes with IL-10 activates primarily STAT3 and , to a lesser extent , STAT1 . ``
However , studies using STAT1-deficient mice indicated that STAT3 is important for IL-10 inhibition of LPS-induced monocyte activation . ``
Because IL-10 activation of STATs is transient in monocytes ( < 30 minutes ) , by the time IFNs were added , activated STAT 's were not present ( data not shown ) .
Because IL-10 treatment of monocytes does not alter the number or affinity of IFN cell surface receptors , another mechanism must be regulated by which IL-10 inhibits IFN-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1 .
There has been recently discovered a new class of molecules referred to as SOCS proteins that seem to be induced by cytokines and then act as negative regulators to inhibit signal transduction .
`` * `` `` These molecules possess SH2 domains and can bind to phosphoty-rosines on Jaks or cytokine receptors .
Of interest , Jak1 is used by all three molecules : IFN « , IFNy , and IL-10 .
There does seem to be some specificity with regard to the inhibitory actions of SOCS , because only SOCS1 and 3 , but not CIS ( an inhibitor of GM-CSF-induced STAT5 ) , were able to inhibit growth hormone-induced STATS activation . ``
Constitutive SOCS1 expression in transfected cells was shown to suppress IFN activation . ``
'' No studies have shown whether IL-10 induces the expression of any SOCS genes .
Experiments to detect association between Jaks and SOCS proteins have been very difficult using available antibodies .
Only very high expression of a transiently transfected myc-JAB ( CIS-like ) gene and Jak2 ( that is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated ) allowed coimmuno-precipitation of these two proteins . ``
'' In this report , we do show that IL-10 can rapidly ( 30 minutes ) induce the expression of SOCS3 , possibly through its ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 .
Whether STAT3-stimulated expression of SOCS3 accounts for the IL-10 inhibition of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation by IFNs is not yet known .
Another well-documented mechanism to inhibit cytokine signaling is the activation of tyrosine phosphatases that inacti-vate Jaks by dephosphorylation .
Ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the erythropoietin receptor can be inhibited by targeting the phosphatase SHP1 ( PTP-1C ) to the receptor , resulting in dephosphorylation of Jak2.45 `` `` Although we have found that the amount of Jakl is unchanged after IL-10 treatment , under the current culture conditions we have not been able to quantitate its degree of tyrosine phosphorylation , either by in vitro kinase assay or by immunoblotting with antiphospho-tyrosine .

1462 tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , there was no evidence that the inhibitory actions of IL-10 were altered , suggesting that IL-10-regulated phosphatase activity is not involved ( data not shown ) .
One common theme throughout the study has been the effect of the dose of IFN on the inhibitory action of IL-10 .
At high doses of either IFNa « or IFNy , the inhibitory action of IL-10 is reduced .
At lower doses of IFN , less STAT1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of IL-10 , suggesting the possibility that an event may be occurring at the plasma membrane that is regulated by IL-10 .
We and others have previously shown that Jaks are associated with IFN receptors , and STAT1 migrates to the receptor once IFN binds .
Because the major event that determines the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 is the concentration of IFN binding to its receptor , it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the effect of IL-10 is to disrupt this multimolecular complex , such that the efficiency of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation is diminished .
IL-10 induction of SOCS3 would be one such mechanism to account for the observed inhibitory actions of IL-10 .
We have shown that IL-10 can inhibit the induction of certain IFN-induced genes .
ICAM-1 was only induced by IFNy and showed good IL-10-induced inhibition .
The inhibition by IL-10 was fairly consistent among the genes , except for IRF-1 .
Although IRF-1 has a GAS motif that drives this gene , there was only a minimal effect by IL-10.4° This gene was readily induced by IFNy in monocytes , but no induction was observed with IFNa ( data not shown ) .
There are several other elements in the promoter of this gene that may override IFNy activation through its GAS element , if this enhancer is inhibited by incubation of cells with IL-10 .
These include Spl and NFkB binding sites .
Recently , mice deficient in the IFN-induced-gene , double-stranded RNA-activated Ser/Thr protein kinase ( PKR ) were studied for their responsiveness to IFNy . ``
PKR is important for IFN-induced activation of NFB .
Cells from these mice showed no IFNy-induced expression of IRF-1-promoter-reporter constructs .
This response was restored on transfection with wild-type PKR , suggesting that NFkB may play an important role in mediating the expression of IRF-1 .
It was recently shown that in human monocytes , there was no inhibition of GAS binding activity or STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation after pretreatment with IL-10 in a study of ICAM-1 induction by IFNy . ``
One possible reason for the discrepancy between our results is the differences in the way the monocytes were prepared .
In Song et al , `` the monocytes were passed over Ficoll-Hypaque and then allowed to adhere for 1.5 hours in medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum .
This process allows for adherence of some B cells and possibly even some T cells .
These monocyte preparations were generally only 85 % pure .
Moreover , Song et al `` `` used a concentration of IFNy ( 10 ng/mL ) that was 10-fold higher than the maximal concentrations of IFNy we used to observe the effects described in this report . ``
'' We observed a decrease in IFN-induced STAT binding to two distinct elements and a decrease in the corresponding STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation for both IFN « and IFNy .
This suggests that , for cells isolated by our method with minimal handling and more physiological concentrations of IFN , incubation with IL-10 inhibits IFN-induced gene activation by preventing the phosphorylation of STAT1 that may occur through activation of a new set of genes that encode for proteins that ITO ET AL suppress continued cytokine activation .
The availability of antibodies to these molecules will enable further characterization of their mechanism of action .
Our findings define an important mechanism by which IL-10 can antagonize IFN-induced gene expression in monocytes .
