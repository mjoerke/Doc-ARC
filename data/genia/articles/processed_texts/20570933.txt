and Richard P. The research described herein evaluates the expression and functional significance of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-y ( PPAR-y ) on B-lineage cells .
Normal mouse B cells and a variety of B lymphoma cells reflective of stages of B cell differentiation ( e.g .
, 702/3 , CH31 , WEHI-231 , CH12 , and J558 ) express PPAR-y mRNA and , by Western blot analysis , the 67-kDa PPAR-y protein .
15-Deoxy-A `` `` `` -PGJ ; , ( 15d-PGJ ; , ) , a PPAR-y agonist , has a dose-dependent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect on normal and malignant B cells as shown by [ H ] thymidine and 3- [ 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl } -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide as-says .
Only PPAR-y agonists ( thiazolidinediones ) , and not PPAR- « agonists , mimicked the effect of 15d-PGJ ; , on B-lineage cells , indicating that the mechanism by which 15d-PGJ ; , negatively affects B-lineage cells involves in part PPAR-y .
The mechanism by which PPAR-y agonists induce cytotoxicity is via apoptosis , as shown by annexin V staining and as confirmed by DNA fragmentation detected using the TUNEL assay .
Interestingly , addition of PGF , , , , which was not known to affect lymphocytes , dramatically attenuated the deleterious effects of PPAR-y agonists on B lymphomas .
Surprisingly , 15d-PGJ ; , induced a massive increase in nuclear mitogen-activated protein kinase activation , and pretreatment with PGF , , , blunted the mitogen-activated protein kinase activation .
This is the first study evaluating PPAR-y expression and its significance on B lymphocytes .
PPAR-y agonists may serve as a counterbalance to the stimulating effects of other PGs , namely PGE , , which promotes B cell differentiation .
Finally , the use of PGs , such as 15d-PGJ ; , , and synthetic PPAR-y agonists to induce apoptosis in B-lineage cells may lead to the development of novel therapies for fatal B lymphomas .

Both 15d-PGJ ; , and the antidiabetic drugs of the thiazolidinedione class are potent ligands for a nuclear hormone receptor known as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y ( PPAR-y ) .
PPAR-y is a member of a superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors that function as ligand-dependent transcription factors ( 8 ) .
Three receptor subtypes of PPARs , termed a , 8 , and 7 , have been identified .
The transcriptional activity of the PPAR subtypes is enhanced by a multitude of chemical compounds , including fatty acids , thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents , selected PGs , peroxisome proliferators , and fibrate hypolipidemic drugs ( 8 ) .
After activation , PPARs control the expression of genes implicated in extra- and intracellular lipid metabolism .
These genes encode enzymes involved in the peroxisomal B-oxidation pathway ( 8 ) .
In particular , PPAR-y is abundantly expressed in adipocytes and functions as a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation ( 9 ) .
15d-PGJ ; , and thiazolidinediones , such as troglitazone and ciglitazone , bind directly to PPARy and promote adipogenesis of cultured fibroblasts ( 9 ) .
Recently , the expression of PPAR-y has been detected on macrophages , T cells , endothelial cells , vascular smooth muscle cells , and colonic tumor cells ( 10-16 ) .
The significance and expression of PPAR-y in the immune-related cells is poorly understood .
Moreover , there are no published data on PPAR expression by B-lineage cells .
In this study 15d-PGJ ; , as well as the synthetic thiazolidinediones are shown to be cytotoxic for B cells and to induce cell death in an apoptotic fashion .
The mechanism by which 15d-PGJ ; , interacts with B-lineage cells involves PPAR-y .
Materials and Methods Reagents 15d-PGJ ; , 4-chloro-6- ( 2,3-xylidino ) -2-pyrimidinylthioacetic acid ( WY-14643 ) , ciglitazone ( thiazolidinedione ) , and anti-PPAR-y1,2 rabbit polyclonal Ab were purchased from Biomol ( Plymouth Meeting , PA ) .

Cell lines and culture conditions 707/3 , ECHA4O08.1 , WEHI-231 , CH31 , CH12 , BAL-17 , and J558 are clonal B lymphoma cell lines that reflect stages of B cell ontogeny and have been described in detail previously ( 17 , 18 ) .
Briefly , 702/3 is positive for cyto-plasmic Ig ; is negative for expression of surface Ig , MHC II , and FcR ; and is a model for pre-B lymphocytes .
CH31 , WEHI-231 , and ECH4O8.1 are lymphomas that express surface IgM , MHC II , FcR , and CD5 ; do not secrete Ig ; and are models for immature B lymphocytes based on their susceptibility to anti-IgM-induced apoptosis .
The BAL-17 and CH12 lymphomas resemble mature B lymphocytes in that they express surface IgM , MHC II , and FcR but do not secrete Ig , nor are they susceptible to anti-IgM-induced apoptosis .
J558 is a mouse myeloma that resembles plasma cells in that it expresses PC.1 , does not express surface Ig , and secretes IgA .
Normal B lymphocytes and lymphoma cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) , 5 X 10~° M 2-ME ( Eastman Kodak , Rochester , NY ) , 10 mM HEPES ( U.S. Biochemical Corp. , Cleveland , OH ) , 2 mM L-glutamine ( Life Technologies ) , and 50 ug/ml gentamicin ( Life Technologies ) .
The B lymphomas were kept under the same culture con-ditions , except for the percentage of FBS , which was 5 % .
Normal and neoplastic B cells and C3H10T1/2 fibroblast-like cells were preincubated with PPAR-y agonists and non-PPAR-y agonists in FBS-free medium for a period of not more than 6 h ( 19 ) .
FBS was then added at the percentages indicated above .
When normal B lymphocytes were used , the medium was also supplemented with IL-4 ( 500 U/ml ; Genzyme , Cambridge , MA ) and Escherichia coli LPS ( 1 ug/ml ; Sigma ) to drive their proliferation .
cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR for PPAR-y Total RNA was extracted with Tri-Reagent ( 5 X 10° cells/ml ) following the supplier 's protocol .
RNA was solubilized in nuclease-free water by heating to 55°C for 10 min .
Two micrograms of RNA was reversed transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( 200 U/reaction ; Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) and random hexamers ( 18 ) .
For each cDNA synthesis reaction , a parallel reaction was performed without reverse transcriptase and was used in PCR as a negative control .
PCR reactions for mouse PPAR-y and GAPDH were performed using Taq DNA polymerase ( 2.5 U ; Roche ) .
Mouse PPAR-y primers sequences were 5-CAAGACTACCCTTTACTGAA and 5-CTACTTTGATCGCACTIT GGT .
PCR samples were initially denatured at 94°C for 1 min and then run for 40 cycles ( 94°C for 45 s , 56°C for 45 s , 72°C for 1 min ) with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min in a DNA thermal cycler ( PTC-200 , MJ Re-search , Watertown , MA ) .
The identities of these RT-PCR products were confirmed by sequencing .
No products were observed in samples lacking reverse transcriptase .
Western blot for PPAR-y Total proteins were isolated from all cell lines using Tri-Reagent and were quantified using bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) .
Fifteen micrograms of total protein was fractionated by 10 % SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a Hybond-Extra nitrocellulose membrane ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
After blocking with 10 % dry milk in 1 % X PBS/0.1 % Tween 20 , membranes were then incubated with anti-PPAR-y ( 1/2000 diluted in PBST ) for 2 h at room temperature .
They were then briefly washed and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit-HRP conjugate ( 1/3000 diluted in 10 % milk-PBST ) for 1 h. Bands were visualized with ECL according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Amersham ) .
The density of the resulting bends was analyzed with Kodak Digital Science software ( New Heaven , CT ) .
Isolation of normal mouse B lymphocytes Mouse B lymphocytes were isolated as previously described ( 20 ) .
In brief , normal mouse splenic B lymphocytes were isolated from 7- to 22-wk-old C57BL/6JXDBA/2J ( B6D2 ( F ; ) ) male mice ( The Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , ME ) .
Erythrocytes were lysed with ammonium chloride buffer , and the suspension was depleted of adherent cells by two successive rounds of adherence on Falcon tissue culture dishes ( Becton Dickinson , Lincoln Park , NJ ) at 37°C for 2 h. Nonadherent cells were collected by rinsing the plates with warm medium .
T cells were depleted with anti-T cell cocktail consisting of Abs 30-H12 ( anti-Thy 1.2 ) , 3.155 ( anti-CD8 ) , and GK 1.5 ( anti-CD4 ) and low toxicity baby rabbit complement ( Cedarlane , Hornby , Canada ) followed by incubation at 37°C .
The cells were washed and PPAR-y ON B-LINEAGE CELLS counted , and viability was determined using the trypan blue exclusion method .
B lymphocytes isolated in this manner are > 95 % surface IgM positive , are Thy-1.2 negative ( as measured by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry ) , and do not express esterase ( a-naphthyl acetate method ) or phagocytic activity ( latex bead method ) .
Purification of small , dense , resting B lymphocytes B cells were separated based on the method of using a discontinuous Per-coll gradient ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) ( 21 ) that was modified to isolate the smallest , densest cells ( 20 ) .
Cells resuspended in PBS ( 1 X 10° ) were applied to the gradient and centrifuged for 12 min at 3000 rpm .
Cells from the lowest interface ( resting B lymphocytes ) were harvested .
This procedure yields 30-50 % of the starting population .
Small , dense , resting B lymphocytes fractionated by this method are > 98 % surface IgM * ( as measured by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry ) .
The median volume of cells in the lower fraction was 105-115 fi as determined by analysis on a Coulter Channelyzer 256 ( Coulter Electronics , Hialeah , FL ) ( 22 ) .
Viability assays Small , resting B lymphocytes and B lymphomas were cultured in flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates ( Falcon , Becton Dickinson ) .
Cells were incubated in triplicate at 5 X 10° cell/ml with 15d-PGJ ; , , PGF ; , , , or DMSO as a control at doses of 0.001-1000 uM for 48 h. Then a solution of 5 mg/ml of MTT in 1X PBS was added ( 10 wl/well ) .
After 4 h at 37°C the plate was centrifuged , the medium was removed , and the insoluble precipitate was dissolved by adding 200 ul of DMSO to each well .
The plate was read at 570 nm on the ELISA reader ( Dynatech , Chantilly , VA ) .
Proliferation assays An experimental set-up similar to that described above for the viability assays was used to assess proliferation .
After the initial 24 h of a 48-h incubation period , cells were pulsed with 1 uCi/well of [ °HJthymidine .
Plates were harvested with a Micromate 196 cell harvester ( Packard , Me-riden CT ) , and incorporation of [ °H ] thymidine was determined with a Matrix 96 direct beta counter ( Packard ) .
Annexin V-fluorescein Double staining for annexin V-FITC binding and for cellular DNA using PI was performed as follows .
Cells ( 1 X 10°/ml ) were incubated in the presence or the absence of PPAR-y agonists , irrelevant agonists , medium only , or DMSO in flat-bottom plates ( Falcon ) for 2-6 h , then washed twice in cold PBS .
The pellet was resuspended in cold binding buffer ( 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.4 ) , 140 mM NaCl , 2.5 mM CaCl , , and 0.1 % BSA ) to a concentration of 1 X 10° cells/ml .
In a separate tube , 100 pl of the cell suspension was incubated for 15 min with 10 wl of annexin V-FITC .
Samples were placed on ice and protected from light .
Without washing , 380 ul of cold 1 % binding buffer was added to each tube .
Then , to each sample 100 ul of PI ( 0.5 mg/ml ) was added before the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry .
All samples were analyzed on an Beckman Coulter EPICS Elite ESP flow cytometer ( Beckman Coulter , Hialeah , FL ) with a 488-nm argon laser .
FITC was collected through a 525-nm bandpass filter , and PI was collected through 610-nm bandpass filters .
Analyses were performed with EPICS Elite software .
TUNEL assay The TUNEL acronym stands for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling of DNA fragmentation sites ( 23 ) .
To study apoptosis by the TUNEL assay , 5.0 X 10° cells/ml were incubated in the presence or the absence of PPAR-y agonists and nonagonists or in medium only and DMSO as controls in flat-bottom plates ( Falcon ) for 6-12 h. Cells were then washed twice in 1X PBS , air-dried on glass microscope slides ( VWR , Media , PA ) , and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde-0.5 % Tween for 10-15 min at room temperature .
Next , the endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched for 15 min .
To label cells , a solution containing recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) , biotin dUTP ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) , and 5 % terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase buffer ( Life Technologies ) was applied to experimental samples for 1 h at 37°C .
The TUNEL reaction was finished with termination buffer ( 300 mM NaCl and 30 mM sodium citrate ) followed by water rinses .
Samples were blocked with 2 % BSA for 10 min at room temperature and treated with streptavidin peroxidase ( 1/6000 ; Zymed , South San Francisco , CA ) for 30 min followed by aminoethylcear-bazole substrate ( Zymed ) for 15 min , coverslipped with Immuno-Mount ( Shandon , Pittsburgh , PA ) , and photographed with an Olympus BMAX B201 microscope ( New Hyde Park , NY ) .
6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG The Journal of Immunology Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) Nuclear protein extracts from B cells were prepared as previously described ( 24 ) and immunoprecipitated overnight using a polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine Ab ( Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY ) .
Protein A-agarose was added , and samples were incubated for 1 h at 4°C .
Complexes were washed with hypotonic buffer containing 0.2 % Nonidet P-40 , and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by discontinuous 9 % PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) .
After blocking with 5 % powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 1 % Tween , membranes were incubated with 1/1000 monoclonal anti-MAPK Ab ( anti-ERK2 , Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) overnight at room temperature and washed , and the secondary , rabbit anti-mouse IgG was added at 1/1000 .
The signals were visualized using an ECL detection kit .
Results B-lineage cells express PPAR-y mRNA and protein 15d-PGJ ; , , in contrast to other PGs , is actively incorporated into the cell by unknown mechanisms and transferred into the nucleus , where it binds to PPAR-y ( 9 ) .
To assess whether small , dense , resting B lymphocytes and B lymphoma cells express mRNA for PPAR-y , RT-PCR analysis was used .
The B lymphoma cells analyzed ranged from 70Z/3 ( pre-B cell ) to J558 ( a plasmacytoma ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , normal splenic B cells and all B lymphoma cells tested yielded a 250-bp product characteristic of PPAR-y mRNA .
C3H10T1/2 cells , a fibroblast-like line , was used as a positive control for PPAR-y mRNA ( 9 ) .
Normal B cells and the same panel of B lymphoma cells as that used for RT-PCR analysis were lysed and analyzed for PPAR-y protein by Western blot using a polyclonal Ab .
PPAR-y appeared as a single band with a characteristic molecular mass of 67 kDa on all the B-lineage cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
While each cell type expressed mRNA for PPAR-y , the relative amount of PPAR-y protein did not vary significantly in B lymphoma cells at different stages of differentiation , as shown by the Western blot ( Fig .
2B ) .
Normal splenic B cells , however , did express a relatively larger amount of PPAR-y protein .
15d-PGJ ; , has a cytotoxic effect on mouse B-lineage cells 15d-PGJ ; , is the only physiological ligand , known to date to bind PPAR-y ( 9 , 25 ) .
[ °H ] thymidine incorporation assays were used to determine whether 15d-PGJ ; , had an effect on proliferation of B-lineage cells .
15d-PGJ ; , was used from 0.001-10 uM for 48 h , and PGF ; , , was included as a negative control prostanoid .
Murine B lymphoma cell lines representative of different stages of B cell ontogeny were used as well as small , dense , resting mouse B cells .
Fig .

C3H10T1/2 were not inhibited in their [ °H ] thymidine incorporation by either 15d-PGJ , or PGF ; , , at 1 uM .
To determine whether the antiproliferative effect that 15d-PGJ , has on B-lineage cells is cytotoxic , MTT assays were performed .
The MTT assay evaluates cell viability via cleavage of MTT into a dark blue crystalline compound by mitochondrial suc-cinic dehydrogenases active only in living cells .
Fig .
4 depicts the effects of 15d-PGJ , on the viability of the different B cell lines .
Once again 15d-PGJ ; , had a uniformly negative effect on B-lineage cells regardless of the stage of B cell ontogeny .
Therefore , 15d-PGJ , is a negative regulator of B-lineage cells .
The mechanism of 15d-PGJ ; cytotoxicity on B-lineage cells involves PPAR-y To investigate whether 15d-PGJ ; , involves PPAR-y as the mechanism for the cytotoxic effect , we used additional known PPAR activators .
Troglitazone and ciglitazone are both antihyperglyce-mic agents that are PPAR-y-selective activators ( 9 , 26 ) .
WY14,643 is a fibrate hypolipidemic drug that activates PPARa selectively ( 27 ) , and eicosatetraynoic acid is a synthetic arachidonic acid analogue that binds PPAR-a « selectively ( 28 ) .
PGF , is used as a negative control prostanoid , because it does not bind to PPARs ( 9 , 25 ) .
[ *HIJthymidine incorporation assays were per-formed , and representative data using CH31 cells are depicted in Fig .
5 .
15d-PGJ , inhibited the incorporation of [ °H ] thymidine in a dose-dependent manner , with total inhibition at 1 wM .
The PPAR-y-selective agonists ciglitazone and troglitazone mimicked the effect of 15d-PGJ ; , on the inhibition of [ °H ] thymidine incorporation .
Troglitazone and ciglitazone were 10-fold less potent than 15d-PGJ ; , in their antiproliferative effect .
This is similar to the increased ability of 15d-PGJ , compared with ciglitazone and troglitazone to bind PPAR-y ( 11 , 26 ) .
Non-PPAR-y agonists such as PGF ; , , , WY14,643 , and eicosatetraynoic acid ( data not shown ) failed to inhibit the proliferation of CH31 cells .
These data indicate that the mechanism by which 15d-PGJ ; , interacts with B-lineage cells involves in part PPAR-y .
These experiments were repeated with other B lymphomas , such as 70Z/3 , CH12 , and ECH4O08.1 , with similar results .
15d-PGJ ; induces apoptosis in B-lineage cells Death by apoptosis is characterized by key morphological features .
These include changes in the plasma membrane , such as loss of membrane asymmetry and attachment , condensation of the cytoplasm and nucleus , and internucleosomal cleavage of DNA by an endogenous endonuclease .
In the final stages the dying cells become fragmented into apoptotic bodies , which are rapidly eliminated by phagocytic cells without eliciting significant inflammatory damage to surrounding cells .
To evaluate whether 15d-PGJ , kills B cells by inducing cell death in an apoptotic fashion we first examined the translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to the outer leaflet by annexin V-FITC labeling .
Annexin V is a Ca* * -dependent , phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for phosphatidylserine ( 29 ) .
Annexin V-FITC in concert with flow cytometry is a sensitive method to detect cells that are undergoing early phases of apoptosis ( Fig .
6 ) .
WEHI-231 cells were incubated in the presence of medium or the PPAR-y agonists , 15d-PGJ , ( 1 uM ) and troglitazone ( 10 uM ; Fig .
6 , A , B , and C , respectively ) , and the non-PPAR-y agonists , WY14,643 and PGF ; , , , ( data not shown ) .
Samples were labeled simultaneously with annexin V-FITC and PI .
The viable cells depicted in Fig .

Membranes were incubated with anti-PPAR-y polyclonal Ab , washed , and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit-HRP conjugate .
Bands were visualized with ECL .

The relative intensities of three separate PPAR-y Western blots using the same assortment of B cell lymphomas and control cell lines were analyzed and plotted .

WEHI-231 cells treated with 15d-PGJ , ; , or troglitazone showed a population of cells that was apoptotic .
Also shown ( box 2 ) were cells that were double positive ( FITC */PI * ) .
These cells were at later stages of apoptosis and showed evidence of necrosis , as they were permeable to PI .
According to these data both PPAR-y agonists induced apoptosis in WEHI-231 cells .
Fig .
7 shows similar results for CH31 cells that were incubated in the presence of medium or the PPAR-y agonists , 15d-PGJ , ( 1 wM ) , ciglitazone ( 10 wM ) , and troglitazone ( 10 uM ; Fig .

CH31 cells treated with 15d-PGJ ; , , ciglitazone , or troglitazone showed a population of cells that was apoptotic .
According to these data PPAR-y agonists induced apoptosis in CH31 cells .
In the final stages of apoptosis , dying cells become fragmented into apoptotic bodies , which are rapidly eliminated by phagocytic cells without eliciting significant inflammatory damage to surrounding cells .
To further confirm that PPAR-y agonists are in ducing cell death in an apoptotic fashion we examined the incorporation of biotin-dUTP ( BdUTP ) by TUNEL assay .
Fig .

PGF , , , abrogates the induction of apoptosis induced by PPAR-y agonists on B lymphoma cells PGF ; , , was recently proposed to modulate the adipogenic effect of 15d-PGJ , ( 15 , 30 ) .
The mechanism by which PGF ; , , interfered with PPAR-y/PPAR-y agonist interaction involved MAPK ( 30 ) .
To further evaluate the mechanisms involved in the interaction between 15d-PGJ , and PPAR-y in B lymphocytes , we preincubated B lymphoma cells ( CH31 , ECH.408.1 , and J558 ) with PGF ; , , ( 0.1 uM ) for 1 h before treatment with 15d-PGJ , ( 1 wM ) .
[ H ] thymidine incorporation assays were used to determine whether PGF , , , modulated the activity of 15d-PGJ , ( Fig .
8A ) .
PGF ; , , strongly blocked the inhibitory action of 15d-PGJ , on these B lymphoma cells , allowing cell proliferation to proceed normally , PPAR-y ON B-LINEAGE CELLS as detected by incorporation of [ °H ] thymidine .
This was interest-ing , as PGF , was not known to have any effect on lymphocytes .
We next examined the effect that these prostanoids had on MAPK activation of B-lineage cells .
Fig .
8B shows the dramatic changes in the levels of MAPK activity reflecting the opposing effects of PGF , and 15d-PGJ ; , .
Treatment with 15d-PGJ , ( 1 wM ) induced a massive increase in MAPK ( Fig .
8B ) .
This was a rather surprising finding , as 15d-PGJ ; , is not known to activate MAPK in nonhe-mopoietic cells .
PGF , , , ( 0.1 uM ) , however , is known to activate MAPK ( 30 ) and does so in B-lineage cells ( Fig .
8B ) .
Pretreatment with PGF ; , , followed by 15d-PGJ , ( 1 wM ) dramatically reduced the ability of 15d-PGJ , to induce MAPK activation ( Fig .
8B ) .
Levels of MAPK activation of untreated cells were negligible .
Discussion This paper presents the finding that B lymphocytes and B lymphoma cells express mRNA and protein for PPAR-y .
Herein is the first report demonstrating the expression of PPAR-y in B cells and the effects of this nuclear receptor on B-lineage cells .
Based on current models of PPARs ( 9 , 25 ) , the PPAR-y agonist 15d-PGJ , interacts with B lymphocytes via the nuclear receptor PPAR-y .
The identification of 15d-PGJ ; , as a ligand for PPAR-y on B lymphocytes implicates a novel pathway in the interaction between PGs and B cells .
The precise molecular pathways by which cy-clopentanone PGs inhibit cell growth and tumorigenicity are un-known .
This paper provides a mechanism by which may have an anti-cancer effect by binding PPAR-y on B lymphoma cells .
Whereas activation of PPAR-y on macrophages antagonizes the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a ( 10 ) , on B lymphomas and B lymphocytes it induces apoptosis .
PGD , the 15d-PGJ , precursor , is the major prostanoid in bone marrow and spleen extracts .
Concentrations in these tissues are reported to be at least as high as 10 wM ( 4 ) , a concentration likely to be effective on B-lineage cells .
Interestingly , PPAR-y has been detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in B lymphocyte proliferation centers of the spleen and the Peyer 's patches , indicating a potential role in regulating immune responses ( 31 ) .
Colocalization of PPAR-y and PGD , in secondary lymphoid organs suggests that PGD , metabolites such as 15d-PGJ , may serve as PPAR-y ligands in B lymphocytes in these tissues .
Therefore , the new data reported herein showing unequivocal PPAR-y WEHI-231 Cells alone FIGURE 6 .

In contrast to other PGs such as PGE , that promote B cell differentiation ( 32 , 33 ) and plasmacytomagenesis ( 34 , 35 ) , PGD , / 15d-PGJ , may inhibit B cell development by rapidly blunting proliferation and killing susceptible cells .
PGF ; , , signals through a cell surface receptor and does not activate PPAR-y ( 9 , 25 ) .
PGF ; , , has an inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation , which involves MAPK ( 15 , 30 ) .
In our investigation PGF , , , strongly modulated the deleterious effect that 15d-PGJ , had on B-lineage cells .
Therefore , 15d-PGJ ; , is not simply a toxic molecule , because PGF , , , attenuates its proapoptotic affects .
We were surprised to see that 15d-PGJ , induced a massive MAPK activation .
PGF , , , pretreatment caused a substantial attenuation of the 15d-PGJ , -induced MAPK .
These data support the concept that the mechanism by which 15d-PGJ ; , interacts with B cells involves PPAR-y .
However , we can not disregard the possibility that 15d-PGJ , may have other effects on B-lineage cells that may be PPAR-y independent , as reported by others studying microglial inducible NO synthase ( 36 ) and neutrophils ( 37 ) .
We speculate that the mechanism by which PPAR-y agonists interact with B lymphocytes and induce apoptosis involves the activation of MAPK .
Additional research will need to be performed to dissert the precise molecular pathways involved in PPAR-y agonist-in-duced signal transduction .
Finally , we suggest a scenario in which alteration of the 15d-PGJ , /PGF ; , , balance could affect the development of B cell lymphomas .
Environments rich in PGF , , , would blunt the ability of 15d-PGJ , to kill B-lineage cells .
Alternatively , the use of 15d-PGJ , or its analogues in the appropriate prostanoid milieu may be useful as a therapy for B-lineage malignancies .
