RAPID COMMUNICATION Activation of Stat-3 Is Involved in the Induction of Apoptosis After Ligation of Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I Molecules on Human Jurkat T Cells By Sgren Skov , Mette Nielsen , Sgren Bregenholt , Niels Odum , and Mogens H. Claesson Activation of Janus tyrosine kinases ( Jak ) and Signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) after ligation of major histocompatibility complex class | ( MHC- ) was explored in Jurkat T cells .
Cross-linking of mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 , but not Jak1 , Jak2 , and Jak3 .
In addition , the transcription factor Stat-3 was tyrosine phosphorylated in the cytoplasma and subsequently translocated to the cell nucleus .
Data obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that the activated Stat-3 protein associates w ith the human serum-inducible element ( hSIE ) DNA-probe derived from the interferon-y activated site ( GAS ) in the c-fos promoter , a common DNA sequence HE MAJOR histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) complex is known for its capacity to present peptide derived from intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T lymphocytes .

Recently , there has been a growing interest in defining the intracellular signals and their consequences for cell activation after ligation of MHC-I molecules .
Thus , it is now well established that ligation of MHC-I molecules expressed on T lymphocytes are critically involved in regulation of T-lymphocyte activation . ``
In an effort to clarify the intracellular signal pathway ( s ) that operates after MHC-I ligation , we have previously shown that MHC-I cross-linking of human T lymphocytes induces tyrosine kinase and PLC-y1 activity . ``
It has been demonstrated by several groups that surface expression of the TCR/CD3 molecule is essential for MHC-l-induced signal transduction . ``
In line with this , we have recently shown that the MHC-I molecule directly uses parts of the TCR/CD3 signal transduction machinery for signal transduction , but that MHC-I cross-linking leads to an alternative TCR/CD3 { -chain phosphorylation resulting in an altered activation of the ZAP7O tyrosine kinase and induction of apoptosis . ``
Deletion of all but the four proximal amino acids from the intracellular domain of the MHC-I molecule does not alter its signal transduction capabili-ties , `` ?

An association between hSIE and Stat-3 after MHC-1 ligation was directly demonstrated by precipitating Stat-3 from nuclear extracts with biotinylated hSIE probe and avidin-coupled agarose .
To investigate the function of the activated Stat-3 , Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with a Stat-3 isoform lacking the transactivating domain .
This dominant-negative acting Stat-3 isoform significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by ligation of MHC-I .
In conclusion , our data suggest the involvement of the Jak/ Stat signal pathway in MHC-l-induced signal transduction in T cells .

Interestingly , it has been demonstrated that MHC-I molecules can associate with receptores for interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and IL-4 as well as insulin and glucagon receptors .

Ligand binding of many different cytokine receptors induces Jak tyrosine kinase activity and Jak 's become noncovalently associated with the actual cytokine receptors .
The Jak kinase family consists of Tyk2 , Jak1 , Jak2 , and Jak3 , which are characterized by the presence of two C-terminal kinase-related domains and the absence of SH2 domains . ``
The Stat proteins are key substrates for the Jak kinases .
Stat proteins are SH2-containing cytoplasmic proteins , which associate with the ligand activated cytokine-receptor/Jak kinase complex via the SH2 domain of the Stat proteins . '
'' Upon tyrosine phosphoryla-tion , Stat proteins are released from the complex and form SH2 domain mediated homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes . '
'' `` These complexes are then translocated to the cell nucleus , where they regulate gene transcription through interaction with specific DNA sequences , most of which are related to the interferon-y ( IFN-y ) activated site ( GAS ) , a regulatory element in the IFN-y inducible genes . ``
Presently , six members of the Stat family are identified and some of these exist in different isoforms . ``
Each Stat protein functions in specific cytokine-receptor signal pathways .
Stat-3 , for example , is activated by various receptors such as the IL-2 receptor , `` `` IL-3 receptor , `` IL-5 receptor , `` IL-6 receptor , `` `` IL-9 receptor , `` `` IL-10 receptor , `` `` colony-stimulating factor-1 , `` `` epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor , `` `` > `` and the thrombopoitin receptor . ``
Evidence suggests that the specificity of Stat phosphorylation is not due to the specificity of Jak activation .
Rather , it is hypothesized that the receptor complex determines which Stat proteins will be accessible to phosphorylation . ``
The aim of the current study was to investigate the involvement of the Jak/Stat signal pathway after MHC-I ligation of human Jurkat T cells .

RESULTS MHC-I ligation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 , but not Jak1-3 .
In an attempt to define intracellular signal transduction pathways responsible for alterations in the proliferation kinetics after ligation of MHC-I , we focused on the involvement of the Jak/Stat pathway , which recently was documented to influence cell cycle kinetics . ``
Lysates from MHC -- ligated Jurkat T cells were immunoprecipitated with specific Abs against the tyrosine kinases Tyk2 , Jak1 , Jak2 , and Jak3 .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of the different kinases was examined as a marker for their activation .

- Immunoprecipitates of Tyk2 obtained from lysates of Jurkat 76.25 cells after MHC-1 or TCR/CD3 ligation .
Cells ( 3 x 10 `` ) were preincubated with PBS ( lane 1 ) or saturating amounts of anti-B ; M Ab ( lanes 2 through 4 ) before exposure to avidin for the indicated time ( lanes 1 through 4 ) or exposed to anti-TCR/CD3 Abs ( lane 5 ) .
Precipitates were immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine Ab ( upper panel ) .
Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-Tyk2 Ab ( lower panel ) .
Figure 1 shows that a small increment of Tyk2 phosphorylation was detected after 2 minutes of MHC-I cross-linking ( Fig 1 , lane 2 ) , and maximal phosphorylation was seen after 5 minutes of stimulation ( Fig 1 , lane 3 ) .
In contrast , TCR/CD3 cross-linking did not induce significant tyrosine phosphorylation of the Tyk2 kinase ( Fig 1 , lane 5 ) .
The time-dependent phosphory-lations of the Tyk2 kinase were not a result of sequestering or degradation of the Tyk2 , because similar amounts of Tyk2 were immunoprecipitated ( Fig 1 , lower part ) .
The inability of TCR/ CD3 to induce Tyk2 phosphorylation was not due to suboptimal TCR/CD3 stimulation , because both MHC-I and TCR/CD3 antibodies were titrated and used at saturating conditions ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , we have previously shown that the level of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins is higher in Jurkat T cells after TCR/CD3 ligation compared with MHC-I ligation `` using antibody concentrations similar to those in Fig 1 .
We were not able to observe any detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , or Jak3 after MHC-I ligation ( data not shown ) .
MHC-I ligation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat-3 .
Because the activation of the Tyk2 kinase has been shown to be implicated in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat proteins , we investigated whether MHC-I cross-linking induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1-6 .
Figure 2 shows immunoprecipitates of the 92-kD Stat-3 protein immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibody ; a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat-3 was observed after 5 minutes of MHC-I ligation ( Fig 2 , lane 2 ) .
Despite a pronounced effect of TCR/CD3 ligation on the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation , `` no specific phosphorylation SKOV ET AL of immunopurified Stat-3 was observed after TCR/CD3 ligation ( Fig 2 , lane 3 ) .
The results were not due to sequestering or degradation of the Stat-3 protein , because similar amounts of Stat-3 were immunoprecipitated in all experiments ( Fig 2 , lower part ) .
Ligation of MHC-I or TCR/CD3 did not induce detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Statl , Stat2 , Stat4 , Stat5 , or Stat6 ( data not shown ) .
MHC-I ligation induces nuclear translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat-3 .
- Tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat proteins are known to translocate to the nucleus , where they function as DNA-binding transcription factors . ``
To determine whether tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were translocated to the nucleus after MHC-I cross-linking , we prepared a highly purified nuclear fraction from Jurkat T cells .
Figure 3 shows an antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot of the nuclear fraction after MHC-I ligation .
In contrast to the fast induction of several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in whole cell lysats after MHC-I ligation , `` only one single phosphotyrosine protein at 92 kD was present in the nucleus ( weakly after 30 minutes of MHC-I ligation and more pronounced after 60 minutes stimula-tion ; Fig 3 ) .
This suggests that the 92-kD protein is tyrosine phosphorylated in the cytoplasma and then subsequently translocated to the nucleus .
To examine whether the 92-kD nuclear translocated protein was identical to the Stat-3 protein , a study with comparable kinetics , as described above , was performed with anti-Stat-3 antibodies .
The Stat-3 protein was present at high concentrations in the cytoplasma ( Fig 4A ) , regardless of cell activation .
Ligation of MHC-I molecules induced a substantial increase in Fig 2 .

The weak bands under Stat-3 are impurities of the nuclear fraction that are not observed consis-tently .
Similar studies were made with Stat1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , but none of these proteins was detected in the cell nucleus after MHC-I ligation ( data not shown ) .
From these results we conclude that MHC-I ligation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic Stat-3 that subsequently translocated to the cell nucleus .
MHC-L-induced Stat-3 binds to specific DNA sequences .
To examine whether the nuclear translocated tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat-3 protein was able directly to associate with DNA , an EMSA analysis was performed using the human serum-inducible element ( hSIE ) probe M67 .
The hSIE DNA-probe has been shown to associate with several Stat proteins , including Stat-3 . ``
'' Figure 5A shows that nuclear proteins from Jurkat T cells 30 minutes after ligation of their MHC-I molecules contained proteins with affinity for the hSIE DNA probe ( Fig 5A , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
The association was highly specific , because the association with the labeled probe was completely inhibited by a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe ( Fig 5A , lane 5 ) .
In contrast , ligation of the TCR/CD3 complex did not induce shifts in the mobility of the hSIE probe .
To verify that the shifted complex contained the Stat-3 molecule , an inhibition experiment was performed .
Figure 5B shows an EMSA analysis in which the nuclear extract was treated with anti-Stat-3 or isotype control antibodies before 3569 incubation with the labeled M67 probe .
No supershift was observed under these conditions , but the shifted band disappeared after treatment with the anti-Stat-3 antibody ( Fig 5B , lane 2 ) , implying that the anti-Stat-3 antibody and the M67 probe compete for binding to the same or nearby epitopes on the Stat-3 protein .
To show that Stat-3 directly associates with hSIE in nuclear extracts from MHC-I ligated cells , Stat-3 was precipitated from the nuclear extract with biotinylated M67 probe and avidin coupled agarose and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-Stat-3 antibodies .

Stat-3 protein in nuclear extracts from MHC -- ligated cells interact with the M67 probe ( Fig 5C , lanes 2 through 4 ) .
These results show that the MHC -- induced nuclear Stat-3 protein can associate with the common Stat binding DNA sequence hSIE from the c-fos promoter .
Overexpression of Stat-3 $ B inhibits MHC-I-induced apoptosis .
- To assess the physiological function of Stat-3 activation after MHC-I ligation , Jurkat T cells were transfected with a normal Stat-3 ( Stat-3 « ) or a Stat-3B construct .
Stat-3 $ B is an isoform that lacks the transactivating domain , and overexpres- sion dominantly inhibits Stat-3-induced transcriptional activa-tion .
`` ® Apoptotic cells have condensed DNA , which leads to a lower stainability with 7-AAD . ``
Apoptotic cells are therefore routinely measured by flow cytometry as the percentage staining below the G ; DNA peak , where the relevant background staining is subtracted ( percentage of sub-G ; staining ) .
The results in Fig 6 show that transfection with Stat-3 $ B significantly inhibits MHC-I-induced apoptosis of Jurkat T cells , as opposed to cells transfected with Stat-3 « or a control CD20 construct .

is involved in the subsequent induction of apoptosis .
Because Stat-3 is constitutively present in the cells , it is not possible to measure the transient transfection efficiency .
To deduce the transfection efficiency , a CD20 construct was transiently transfected in parallel into Jurkat T cells using the same transfection procedures as with the Stat-3 constructs .
The percentage of CD20+* cells was measured by flow cytometry .
Transfection efficiency ranged from 35 % to 45 % ( data not shown ) .
MTT and proliferation analyses showed no difference in the viability or proliferation of Jurkat T cells transfected with either control or Stat-3 « or Stat-3B constructs ( data not shown ) , implying that Stat-3 transfection does not interfere with the endogenous proliferation or viability of Jurkat T cells .
DISCUSSION MHC-I-induced signaling in T cells may lead to a number of functional alterations , including apoptosis , alteration of cell proliferation , cytokine secretion , and new surface pheno-types . ``
To further clarify distinct signal pathways operating after MHC-I ligation , the engagement of the Jak/Stat signal pathway in MHC -- induced signaling in human T cells was investigated in the present work .
We provide here evidence that MHC-I ligation of human T cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the Tyk2 tyrosine kinase .
In contrast , none of the other Jak family tyrosine kinases ( Jak1 , Jak2 , or Jak3 ) was activated after MHC-I ligation .
Immunoprecipitation of the Stat-family proteins Stat-1 through Stat-6 showed that the 92-kD Stat-3 protein was tyrosine phosphorylated in response to MHC-I ligation , whereas no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 , Stat2 , Stat4 , Stat5 , and Stat6 was observed .
In accordance with a previous study by 3571 Beadling et al , `` ° we did not observe activation of proteins from the Jak and Stat families after TCR/CD3 ligation .
Tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat proteins make homodimers and/or heterodimers in the cytoplasm and are subsequently translocated to the cell nucleus by a currently unknown mechanism . ``
To elucidate whether tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were translocated to the nucleus upon MHC-I ligation , a highly purified nuclear fraction was obtained from Jurkat T-cell lysates .
In the nuclear fraction , a 92-kD tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was observed after 30 minutes of MHC-I ligation that became more intensively phosphorylated after 60 minutes of stimulation .
Because the induction of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the cytolasma is observed within 5 seconds , `` this suggests that the protein was tyrosine phosphorylated in the cytoplasma and subsequently translocated to the cell nucleus .
Studies were performed to elucidate whether the 92-kD protein was identical to the Stat-3 protein .
Immunoblotting of a purified nuclear lysats with anti-Stat-3 antibodies showed that the Stat-3 protein was indeed observed in the nucleus after 60 minutes of MHC-I ligation .
Together , these results strongly suggest that MHC-I ligation of T cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of the Stat-3 transcription factor .
We tested whether nuclear supernatant from MHC-I-stimulated cells could associate with the hSIE DNA probe derived from the c-fos promoter , a DNA sequence known to associate with various activated Stat proteins , including Stat-3.5 `` In a gel-shift assay ( EMSA ) , nuclear supernatant from MHC-Hligated Jurkat T cells induced a clear shift in the mobility of the hSIE probe , indicating an association between the hSIE DNA probe and one or more of the proteins in the nuclear supernatant .
Furthermore , the shifted complex was absent in nuclear extracts preincubated with anti-Stat-3 antibod-ies , and the Stat-3 protein could be coprecipitated from nuclear cell extracts of Jurkat T cells with a biotinylated hSIE probe and avidin-coupled agarose .
Together , these results demonstrate that the Stat-3 protein from MHC -- ligated cells specifically interacts with DNA representing a common Stat binding sequence .
To investigate the functional consequences of MHC-I-induced Stat-3 activation , Jurkat T cells were transfected with constructs encoding Stat-3 « or Stat-3B .
When cells were transiently transfected with the nontransactivating isoform Stat-3B , a significant reduction in the MHC-I-induced apoptosis of Jurkat T cells was observed .
Because of technical limitations , we were only able to transiently transfect about 40 % of the cells ; therefore , it is hard to judge whether the dominant negatively acting Stat-3B totally abolish apoptosis after MHC-I ligation or whether other signals participate .
Nonetheless , the data suggest that activated Stat-3 is involved at least in a significant part of the intracellular signals leading to apoptosis after MHC-I ligation .
We tried to produce Jurkat T cells stabily transfected with the Stat-3B construct , but , unfortu-nately , the attempts were not successful .
Of particular interest , we have recently found that JNK activity is critically involved in MHC-L-induced apoptosis . ``
Thus , in future studies , it will be of interest to elucidate the cooperation between JNK and Stat-3 in MHC-I-induced apoptosis .

3572 It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of the MHC-I molecule is not essential for MHC-l-induced signal transduction `` ; therefore , it is highly likely that the MHC-I molecule associates with and uses the signal transduction devices of other transmembrane molecules .
The MHC-I molecules have been shown to be either physically or functionally coupled to other signal transducing proteins .
This report presents evidence that MHC-I ligation mediates signals through the Jak/Stat signal pathway .
It is therefore tempting to suggest that MHC-I molecules either directly or indirectly associate with receptor ( s ) for growth regulatory cytokine ( s ) .
An alternative explanation is that the MHC-I signal induces secretion of intracellular stores of cytokines to the media , which then mediate the activation of the TYK2 kinase and the Stat-3 protein through their respective receptors .
However , this scenario is highly unlikely , because fresh Jurkat T cells exposed to antibody-depleted culture supernatants from 2 to 10 minutes with MHC -- ligated cells did not show any tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat-3 ( data not included ) .
The MHC molecules associate both directly and functionally with the IL-2 and IL-4 receptors'* `` `` ' ; therefore , these receptors could be likely candidates through which the MHC-I molecule activates TYK2 and Stat-3 .
To our knowledge , no single receptor has been shown to exclusively phosphorylate TYK2 and Stat-3 .
This suggests that the MHC-I molecules do not uncritically use cytokine receptors and mediate the same signal as these ; teleologically , this would also be very inappropriate in a complex biological system .
Rather , it is likely that the MHC-I molecule by ligation induces specific changes in the receptor to which it associates and thereby induces a specific signal .
The precise physiological function of Stat proteins is currently not well understood .
One or more Stat proteins are activated in response to almost all known cytokines .
This suggests that Stat proteins are involved in various physiological signals , as diverse as signals leading to growth progression through cell cycle from G ; to G ; to signals leading to growth inhibition and activation-induced cell death .
Of particular interest , Toshio Hirano 's group has recently demonstrated that mutation of the Stat-3 binding domain in the cytoplasmic part of the gp130 chain of the IL-6 receptor abolished IL-6-induced growth arrest . ``
Subsequently , the same group showed that dominant-negative forms of Stat-3 inhibited IL-6-induced growth arrest at These observations are in accordance with the observations on Jurkat T cells described in this report and our recent data showing that MHC-I ligation induces a particular anergic-like phenotype of the { -chain and ZAP70 tyrosine kinase , `` `` reduces colony formation in semisolid cul-ture , `` * and is a key inducer of growth arrest and apoptosis .
46194547 We have previously shown that staphylococcal enterotoxins exert a profound inhibitory effect on IL-2-induced Jak3 and Stat protein activation , `` a process dependent on MHC class II binding by the staphylococcal enterotoxin ( N.G .
, unpublished observation ) .
Even though there has been an enormous interest in the Jak/Stat signal pathway , relatively little is known about its biological function .
Our hypothesis is that the MHC-I molecule uses other transmembrane molecules for signal transduction , which may induce both MHC-I-specific signals and modulation SKOV ET AL of cytokine receptor signaling .
The nature of this signal molecule ( s ) and the extent of its modulation remain to be clarified .
