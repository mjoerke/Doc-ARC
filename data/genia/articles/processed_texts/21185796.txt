HEMATOPOIESIS Core-binding factor B ( CBFB ) , but not CBFB-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain , rescues definitive hematopoiesis in CBFB-deficient embryonic stem cells Janelle D. Miller , Terry !
Stacy , P. Paul Liu , and Nancy A. Speck Core-binding factor B ( CBFRB ) is the non-DNA-binding subunit of the heterodimeric CBFs .
Genes encoding CBFB ( CBFB ) , and one of the DNA-binding CBFa « subunits , Runx1 ( also known as AML1 , and PEBP2 « B ) , are required for normal hematopoiesis and are also frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias in humans .
Homozygous disruption of either the Runx ?
or Cbfb gene in mice results in embryonic lethality at midgestation due to hemorrhaging in the central nervous system , and severely impairs fetal liver hematopoiesis .
Results of this study show that Cbfb-deficient mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells can differentiate into primitive erythroid colonies in vitro , but are impaired in their ability to produce definitive erythroid and myeloid colonies , mimicking the in vivo defect .
Definitive hematopoiesis is restored by ectopic expression of full-length Cbfb transgenes , as well as by a transgene encoding only the heterodimerization domain of CBFB .
In contrast , the CBFB-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain ( SMMHC ) fusion protein generated by the inv ( 16 ) associated with acute myeloid leukemias ( M4Eo ) can not rescue definitive hematopoiesis by Cbfb-deficient ES cells .
Sequences responsible for the inability of CBFB-SMMHC to rescue definitive hematopoiesis reside in the SMMHC portion of the fusion protein .
Results also show that the CBFB-SMMHC fusion protein transdominantly inhibits definitive hematopoiesis , but not to the same extent as homozygous loss of Runx1 or Cbfb .
CBFB-SMMHC preferentially inhibits the differentiation of myeloid lineage cells , while increasing the number of blastlike cells in culture .

2001 ; 97 : 2248-2256 ) ©2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Core-binding factors ( CBFs ) are heterodimeric transcription factors consisting of a DNA-binding subunit ( CBFa ) and a non-DNA-binding CBFB subunit . '
> Three genes in mammals encode CBFa subunits ( Runxl , Runx2 , Runx3 , formerly known as Chfa2 , Chfal , and Cbfa3 , respectively ) , whereas the CBFB subunit is encoded by one gene , Chfb .
'® CBFRB heterodimerizes with all 3 CBFa subunits in vitro , but the functional significance of this interaction has been shown only for Runx1 .
Homozygous disruption of either the gene encoding Runx1 or CBFR caused identical developmental defects , indicating that both subunits are essential for the Runx1-CBFB heterodimer to function in vivo .
`` * > The CBFs function in multiple developmental pathways in mammals and invertebrates .
The Drosophila runt gene , which encodes a CBF subunit , is involved in sex determination , segmentation , and neurogenesis .
'*~ ' `` The related gene lozenge plays a role in developmental pathways involving the eye , antenna , and tarsal claws , and in the formation of crystal cells , a lineage of blood cells in the fly . '
% `` ° The mammalian Runx2 gene is required for bone formation , `` and both Runx !
and Chfb are required for definitive hematopoiesis . ``
Definitive hematopoiesis is the second wave of hematopoiesis in the developing vertebrate embryo and produces hematopoietic cells of the lymphoid , myeloid , and enucleated ( definitive ) erythroid lineages .
Definitive hematopoiesis is preceded by primitive erythropoiesis , which occurs in the yolk sac and produces a transient population of nucleated primitive erythrocytes and macro-phages .
Progenitors and stem cells that give rise to the definitive hematopoietic lineages emerge in the yolk sac , the para-aortic splanchnopleure , the vitelline and umbilical arteries , and in the aorta/genital ridge/mesonephros ( AGM ) region in mammalian embryos .
`` `` > 5 Homozygous disruption of or Chfb does not appear to significantly impair the first stage of primitive erythropoiesis in the yolk sac , but blocks the second wave of definitive hematopoiesis . ``
RUNX1 ( AMLT ) and CBFB are frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in human leukemias . ``
'' is disrupted by the t ( 8 ; 21 ) ( q22 ; q22 ) and t ( 12 ; 21 ) ( p13 ; q22 ) in acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias,4 `` `` `` 8 and by the t ( 3 ; 21 ) ( q26 ; q22 ) and t ( 16 ; 21 ) ( q24 ; q22 ) in therapy-related leukemias and myelodyspla-sias .
`` `` 4 `` CBFB is disrupted in acute myeloid leukemias by inv ( 16 ) ( p13 ; q22 ) , t ( 16 ; 16 ) , and del ( 16 ) ( q22 ) . ``
The translocations generate chimeric proteins that contain all or part of Runx1 or CBFB fused to sequences encoded in the other chromosomal segment involved in the translocation .
For example , the inv'© that disrupts CBFB results in a chimeric protein that contains most of the CBFRB protein fused to the C-terminal « -helical rod domain from a smooth muscle myosin heavy chain ( SMMHC ) encoded by the MYHI/ gene.© Genetic experiments in mice demonstrated that the CBFB-SMMHC protein transdominantly inhibits wild-type Runx1 : CBFB function in vivo , in that mice heterozygous for a `` knocked-in `` From the Department of Biochemistry , Dartmouth Medical School , Hanover , NH ; and the Oncogenesis and Development Section , Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch , National Human Genome Research Institute , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD .

* ' Expression of a CBFB-MYH11 transgene in myeloid lineage cells impaired neutrophilic differentiation and this effect was enhanced by an activated N-ras oncogene . ``
The CBFB-SMMHC protein is thought to transdominantly inhibit Runx1 : CBFB function by heterodimeriz-ing with RUNX1 and sequestering it on actin filaments in the cytoplasm , `` `` 4* or by functioning as a dedicated transcriptional repressor in the nucleus . ``
A number of studies have demonstrated the utility of differentiating mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells in vitro to study hematopoi-esis , *° and showed that ES cells deficient in proteins critical for hematopoiesis in the embryo often show similar hematopoietic impairments in vitro .
For example , GATA-1-deficient ES cells fail to develop primitive erythroid precursors in vitro , and definitive erythropoiesis is blocked at the proerythroblast stage of develop-ment .
* `` Ectopic expression of GATA-I transgenes in an immature erythroid cell line derived from GATA-1-deficient ES cells restored terminal erythroid differentiation in vitro . ``
SCL-deficient ES cells fail to generate either primitive or definitive hematopoietic cells of all lineages , and this defect could be rescued by ectopic expression of the Sci transgene.4 `` `` ° ES cells homozygous for deletion of PU . ]

'' Runx1-deficient ES cells can not produce definitive hematopoietic progenitors , but a Runx !
transgene knocked into the Runx1 locus rescued definitive hematopoiesis . ``
Here we demonstrate that Ch/b-deficient ES cells undergo primitive erythropoiesis in vitro , but are impaired in their ability to undergo definitive hematopoiesis .
Ectopic expression of Cbfb transgenes from the murine stem cell virus ( MSCV ) restores definitive hematopoiesis of CBFRB-deficient ES cells .
We demonstrate that the heterodimerization domain in CBFRB is sufficient for its function in this assay .
In contrast , the CBFB-SMMHC fusion protein is unable to rescue definitive hematopoiesis by CBFB-deficient ES cells , and thus can not provide CBFB function in vivo .
We also show that the CBFBGB-SMMHC protein does not completely impair definitive hematopoiesis in cells containing one copy of the Chfb-MYH1T1 allele and one wild-type Chfb allele , indicating that Runx1-CBFRB function is not completely inhibited by the CBFB-SMMHC protein .

'' `` * Murine Ch/b complementary DNAs ( cDNAs ) were subcloned into a murine stem cell viral vector harboring a puromycin-N-acetyltransferase gene ( MSCVpac ) `` * ( subcloning details will be provided on request ) .
Transfection of the packaging cell line and transduction of +/+ , Cbfb `` ~ , and Cbfb '~ ES cells were performed as described by Pear and coworkers . ``
'' Briefly , BOSC23 cells were transiently transfected by the CaC ) ; precipitate method in the presence of 25 mM chloroquine .
Retroviral supernatants ( 3 mL ) were harvested 48 hours later , passed through 0.2 um filters , and added directly to subconfluent ES cell cultures .
Polybrene ( 4 g/mL ; hexadimethrine bromide ; Sigma , St Louis , MO ) was added and cultures were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours .
ES cell culture medium ( described below ) was added ( 7 mL ) and the cultures were continued with daily changes of medium .
After 48 hours , transduced ES cells were selected with 2 mg/mL puromycin and maintained in the presence of puromycin until cells in control cultures were no longer alive .
Resistant cells were expanded and tested for transgene expression by Western blotting .

Results Definitive hematopoiesis is impaired in Runx1 and CBFB-deficient ES cells Keller and coworkers demonstrated that ES cells cultured under specific conditions generate differentiated hematopoietic cells in vitro . ``
'' Both the kinetics of precursor development and the responsiveness to growth factors are similar to those found in yolk sac and fetal liver , paralleling hematopoietic development that occurs in the embryo .
Large numbers of primitive erythroid precursors emerge first , peaking at day 7 of primary culture , followed by precursors for definitive erythroid , myeloid , and mixed erythroid/myeloid lineage colonies ( peaking at days 8-10 ) , and finally mast cell precursors ( day 10 ) .
We cultured wild-type , Runx1'- , and Cbfb '- ES cells in vitro to generate EBs , as schematically illustrated in Figure 1 A , disaggregated the EBs 6 and 10 days after the establishment of the primary culture , and replated the cells in the presence of hematopoietic growth factors .

~- , or Chfb- `` - ES cells contained large numbers of progenitors for primitive erythroid colonies ( Figure 1C ) .
Primitive erythroid colonies are smaller and brighter red and composed of larger cells than definitive erythroid colonies .
Primitive erythroid progenitors were still present in secondary cultures of day 10 EBs from all 3 ES cell lines ; however , as expected , their numbers dropped markedly . ``
'' Only day 10 EBs from wild-type ES cells contained progenitors for all lineages of definitive colonies .
Day 10 EBs from Runx1~ `` ~ ES cells contained only primitive erythroid progenitors , whereas day 10 EBs from Cbfb~ `` - ES cells contained primitive erythroid progenitors and reduced numbers of progenitors for myeloid colonies ( Figure 1B ) .
Thus , the hematopoietic defect in ES cell cultures mimics that seen in Runx1- and CBFB-deficient mice , in that definitive hematopoiesis is blocked while primitive erythropoiesis is spared .
The small number of myeloid progenitors in Chfb- `` ~ ES cells also reflects data obtained in mice , where we observed the number of definitive hematopoietic progenitors was severely , but not completely , depressed in the fetal liver and yolk sac .

Ectopic expression of Cbfb transgenes rescues definitive hematopoiesis by CBFB-deficient ES cells Four distinct cDNAs representing alternatively spliced isoforms of CBFRB have been isolated `` ( Figure 2A ) .
Two isoforms , CBFRB ( p22 ) and CBFB ( p21.5 ) , encode CBFRB proteins containing 187 and 182 amino acids , respectively , that heterodimerize efficiently with CBFa subunits in vitro . ``
The CBFB ( p17.6 ) isoform lacks amino acids encoded in exon 3 and fails to heterodimerize with CBFa in vitro . ``
CBFB ( p18 ) lacks amino acids encoded in exon 5 , including the last 2 amino acids ( aa 134-135 ) in the domain that mediates heterodimerization with CBFa « . ``
'' The Chfb- `` ~- ES cells used in the in vitro differentiation assay contain a deletion in exon 5 of the Cbfb gene . ``
RT-PCR products encoding the CBFB ( p18 ) isoform were amplified from embryos produced from the same Chfb '- ES cells ; however , a noticeable decrease in Chfb messenger RNA level was observed compared to wild-type embryos . ``
Western blotting with both embryos and ES cells showed that levels of the truncated CBFB ( p18 ) protein were greatly reduced compared with those of the endogenous CBFB ( p22 ) and CBFB ( p21.5 ) proteins . ``
Heterodimerization of CBFB ( p18 ) with CBFa on DNA in vitro was shown to be relatively weak . '
'' `` Specifically , CBFB ( p18 ) dissociates more readily from the CBFo-DNA complex than does CBFB ( p22 ) or CBFB ( p21.5 ) during the process of electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels in electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
We introduced transgenes encoding all 4 CBFRB isoforms into Cbfb~ `` - ES cells using the MSCV retroviral vector . ``
Pools of drug-resistant ES cells were isolated and screened for CBFB expression by Western blot ( Figure 2B ) .
Ectopically expressed CBFB ( p22 ) and CBFB ( p21.5 ) comigrate with endogenous CBFB and accumulate at levels similar to that of the endogenous protein ( s ) in cells .
Ectopically expressed CBFB ( p18 ) migrates faster than endogenous CBFB through SDS-polyacrylamide gels .
The steady-state level of ectopically expressed CBFB ( p18 ) ( Figure 2B , lanes 7-8 ) was similar to that of the endogenous CBFB ( p22 ) and/or CBFB ( p21.5 ) protein in wild-type ES cells ( Figure 2B , lane 1 ) , but much greater than that of endogenous CBFB ( p18 ) in either Cbfb* `` * or Cbfb '- ES cells ( Figure 2B , lanes 1-2 ) .
Ectopically expressed CBFB ( p17.6 ) , as well as endogenous CBFB ( p17.6 ) , were not detectable by Western blot .

Similar results were obtained in 4 independent experiments .
Differences in numbers of various colony types with expression of different transgenes were not statistically significant .
these CBFB isoforms are functional in vivo ( Figure 2C-E ) .
Ectopic expression of CBFB ( p18 ) also restored definitive hematopoiesis ( Figure 2B ) .
Although the Chb '~ ES cells may produce the CBFB ( p18 ) isoform from the mutated Chfb locus , `` its concentration in Chfb_'~- cells and embryos was apparently insufficient for in vivo function .
However , the residual CBFB ( p18 ) activity in Cbfb~ `` - cells may account for the small numbers of definitive hematopoietic progenitors found in both ES cell cultures and mouse embryos . ``
The CBFB ( p17.6 ) failed to rescue definitive hematopoiesis ( not shown ) .
This result can not be interpreted as an intrinsic failure of CBFB ( p17.6 ) to rescue because the protein was not detectable .
The heterodimerization domain for the CBFa proteins is contained within the N-terminal 135 amino acids of CBFB ( p22 ) and CBFB ( p21.5 ) . ``
'' We previously showed that an amino acid 1 to 141 fragment of CBFB , referred to as CBFB ( 141 ) , binds to a Runx1-DNA complex with a K , equivalent to that of full-length CBFB ( p22 ) . ``
'' CBFB ( 141 ) also assumes a folded structure indistinguishable from that which it assumes in the context of the full-length Ectopic expression of CBFB ( 141 ) restores definitive hematopoiesis by Chfb '- ES cells ( Figure 26 ) .
The presence of definitive erythroid colonies was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of B-globin expression ( Figure 2D ) .
Primitive erythroid cells express both embryonic ( BH1 ) and adult type ( B major ) B-globin , whereas definitive erythroid cells express only the B major gene .
Individual definitive erythroid colonies isolated from secondary cultures of Chfb_'~ ES cells expressing CBFB ( 141 ) transcribed the B major , but not the BHI gene ( Figure 2D , lanes 7-8 ) .
Therefore , the heterodimerization domain of CBFB , which is common to both the CBFB ( p21.5 ) and CBFB ( p22 ) isoforms , is sufficient for CBFB function in hematopoiesis in this assay system .
One limitation of the rescue assay is that numbers of definitive colonies produced from both Chfb* `` * ES cells and Ch/b- '- ES cells expressing various transgenes varied from 5- to 20-fold between experiments , making quantitative comparisons of the ability to rescue difficult .
Although the rescue assay is not quantitative , under no circumstances did we detect progenitors for definitive erythroid or mixed erythroid/myeloid lineage colonies in EBs derived from Cbfb '~ ES cells .
Therefore , we scored the appearance of definitive erythroid and mixed erythroid/myeloid lineage progenitors as rescue , and the absence of such progenitors as failure to rescue .

Expression of either the 67-kd ( Figures 3C and 4C ) or the 71-kd ( Figure 4C ) isoforms of CBFB-SMMHC failed to rescue definitive hematopoiesis .
This indicates either that expression levels of these proteins were insufficient to restore CBFB function , or that the CBFB-SMMHC proteins are intrinsically defective in providing CBFB function in vivo .
However , a truncated form of the CBFB-SMMHC protein lacking the C-terminal 317 amino acids of the SMMHC tail region , CBFRB-SMMHC4¢3 ! ``
( Figure 4A ) , when ectopically expressed at approximately equivalent levels as the full-length CBFB-SMMHC proteins ( Figure 4B , lanes 3 , 4 , and 7 ) , rescued definitive hematopoiesis of Chfb '- ES cells ( Figure 4C ) .
CBFB-SMMHC43 `` lacks SMMHC sequences that enable it to associate with and sequester CBFa subunits on cytoplasmic actin filaments . ``

CBFB-SMMHC impairs myeloid cell differentiation To address the possibility that the concentration of ectopically expressed CBFB-SMMHC was not adequate to overcome endogenous wild-type CBFB function in this assay , we analyzed the hematopoietic potential of ES cells heterozygous for a ChJb-MYH11 `` knock-in `` allele .
This allele was generated by replacing a portion of exon 5 from the mouse Chfb gene with exon 5 sequences from the human CBFB gene , fused to MYH11 sequences . ``
Both the normal CBFB proteins and the 71-kd CBFB-SMMHC fusion protein are expressed from the endogenous Chfb promoters in the `` knock-in `` ES cells ( Figure 3B , lane 8 ) .
It was previously demonstrated that embryos heterozygous for the MYB !
allele die at midgestation and display impaired definitive hematopoiesis , with severely depressed numbers of definitive hematopoietic progenitors in fetal livers and yolk sacs . ``
The ES cells heterozygous for the Chfb *** `` !
allele produced significantly more definitive hematopoietic progenitors than either Cbfb- `` -or RunxI- `` - ES cells in vitro ( Figures 5A and 1B ) .
The number of definitive progenitors generated by E5 cells was in fact only modestly reduced , ranging from 0- to 10-fold in independent experiments , relative to progenitor numbers from wild-type ES cells .
Thus , the same ratio of CBFB-SMMHC to CBFR sufficient to cause embryonic lethality in mice is insufficient to completely block definitive hematopoiesis by ES cells cultured in vitro .
Although the absolute numbers of definitive colonies produced by the ES cells were only modestly reduced compared to wild-type ES cells , expression of the CBFB-SMMHC fusion protein preferentially inhibited the formation of myeloid colonies , relative to primitive and/or definitive erythroid colonies ( Figure 5B ) .
Cytospins of secondary cultures from wild-type and BS cells revealed significantly different ratios of individual cell types ( Figure 5C ) .
Most of the cells derived from wild-type ES cells were macrophage-like with prominent foamy cytoplasm .
Hematopoietic cells from colonies derived from BS cells were more heterogeneous .
Many more cells showed evidence of erythroid differentiation , including multinucleate forms .
There was some maturation to macrophage-like cells .
Occasional cells were granulated , suggesting mast cell differentiation .
Many precursor cells with higher nuclear cytoplasmic ratios and nucleoli were also present .
Enumeration of these various cell types indicated a decrease in the percentage of mature myeloid cells and an increase in the percentage of erythroid and blast-like cells in cultures derived from ES cells ( Figure 5C ) .
Because we observed an increase in the number of primitive erythroid colonies , we believe that the overall increase in erythroid cells is due to an increase in primitive erythroid cells .

Discussion CBFRB is the non-DNA-binding subunit of the CBF complexes .
CBFRB heterodimerizes with the DNA-binding Runt domain of the CBFa proteins , and increases their affinity for DNA .
No other biochemical functions of the CBFRB protein have thus far been demonstrated .
Here we describe an assay for CBFRB function based on the ability of ectopically expressed Chfb transgenes to rescue definitive hematopoiesis by CBFB-deficient ES cells in culture .
Using this assay , we show that 2 CBFB isoforms previously shown to form stable heterodimers with CBFa in vitro , CBFB ( p22 ) and CBFB ( p21.5 ) ,2 `` are both capable of providing CBFB function in vivo .
A third CBFB isoform , CBFB ( p18 ) , which forms an unstable complex with CBFa and DNA in vitro , '* `` also restores definitive hematopoiesis by Cbfb_~- ES cells .
In addition , we demonstrate that the heterodimerization domain of CBFRB , which mediates its interaction with the CBFa Runt domain , is sufficient for its in vivo function with Runx1 in this assay .
Kanno and colleagues also showed that the CBFB heterodimerization domain can support transactivation by Runx1 , using a transient expression and reporter gene assay in Jurkat T cells . ``
We both confirm and extend their analyses by demonstrating the heterodimerization domain of CBFB is sufficient to carry out a developmental program that requires CBFB .
The ability of CBFB ( p18 ) to rescue hematopoiesis was somewhat unexpected , given that CBFB ( p18 ) is synthesized from the endogenous mutated Chfb allele in Chfb_'- ES cells . ``
CBFB ( p18 ) lacks exon S-encoded sequences , including 2 amino acids ( aa 134-135 ) at the C-terminus of the heterodimerization domain defined by Kagoshima and coworkers . ``
Amino acids 134 to 135 reside in the middle of an « helix spanning amino acids 129 to 138 . ``
'' `` Truncation of this a helix in the CBFB ( p18 ) isoform appears to destabilize the heterodimerization domain to some extent , as evidenced by the instability of ternary Runx1-CBFB ( p18 ) -DNA complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays . ``
However , CBFB ( p18 ) contains all the amino acids that comprise the interaction surface for the CBFa Runt domain , ® `` and when present at sufficiently high concentrations can provide CBFRB function in vivo .
Thus , it appears that the hematopoietic block resulting from the mutation we and others introduced into the Ch/b gene `` was primarily due to insufficient levels of the CBFB ( p18 ) protein in Cbfb_ `` - ES cells and embryos .
We show that the emergence or differentiation of definitive hematopoietic progenitors from ES cells heterozygous for a `` knocked-in `` allele is only modestly impaired in vitro .
This was somewhat unexpected given the dramatic phenotype observed in mice heterozygous for the Chfb `` * `` `` allele .

/+ HSCs may have emerged in chimeric mice because of the incomplete repression of normal Runx1-CBFB function by the allele .
The Chfb® > **2 `` /+ HSCs were found to give rise to mature erythrocytes efficiently but were unable to differentiate along myeloid and lymphoid lineages . ``
Transgenic mice in which expression of CBFB-SMMHC was specifically targeted to myeloid cells showed impairment but not a complete block of neutrophil differentiation . ``
The in vivo findings are consistent with ES cell differentiation results reported here and suggest that CBFB-SMMHC preferentially impairs the differentiation of myeloid lineage cells .
An incomplete block in definitive hematopoiesis was also seen in the t ( 8 ; 21 ) knock-in mouse models , in which cDNAs encoding the AML1-ETO fusion protein were introduced into the Runxl gene . ``
For example , Yergeau and associates demonstrated that although no definitive hematopoietic colonies of any kind could be cultured from yolk sacs derived from 10.5 days post coitus ( dpc ) Runx1-deficient embryos , macrophage-like colonies differentiated from the yolk sacs of embryos heterozygous for the t ( 8 ; 21 ) knock-in allele . ``
More recently and dramatically , Okuda and coworkers reported that in their independently derived t ( 8 ; 21 ) knock-in mouse strain , dysplastic progenitors for mixed lineage colonies could be found in the fetal livers of day 11.5 to 13.5 embryos , and that these progenitors had an abnormally high self-renewal capacity . ``
'' We recently found that the hematopoietic block in Runx !
~ `` ~ mice occurs during the emergence of definitive hematopoietic progenitors in the embryo ( North and colleagues , unpublished results , 2000 ) .
The in vivo data from the t ( 8 ; 21 ) knock-in mice generated by Okuda and coworkers suggest that some definitive hematopoietic progenitors escape the early block associated with loss of Runx1 function and emerge , but are unable to complete differentiation into mature myeloid and erythroid cells . ``
The impaired differentiation of myeloid lineage cells may be an important step in leukemogenesis associated with the t ( 8 ; 21 ) and inv ( 16 ) .
Incomplete repression of wild-type Runx1-CBFB function by the transdominant negative AMLI-ETO and CBFB-MYH11 alleles may allow for the expansion and persistence of a population of myeloid progenitors that then become targets for the secondary mutations required for leukemic transformation .
Continued culture of the colonies derived from ES cells resulted in the outgrowth of 2 cell lines , with different morphologic features and cell surface phenotypes .
We do not References CBFB AND CBFB-SMMHC IN DEFINITIVE HEMATOPOIESIS _ 2255 understand the significance of the differences between the 2 cell lines .
It is unclear whether the outgrowth from secondary ES cell cultures is directly caused by the presence of the CBFB-SMMHC protein , and additional experiments are needed to more completely assess the effects of CBFB-SMMHC on proliferative potential .
However , the kinetics of cell outgrowth suggest that the CBFB-SMMHC protein by itself was insufficient to immortalize primary hematopoietic cells .
This is consistent with the demonstration that ChfbCh » MYH4 `` + chimeric mice developed leukemias only at a low frequency and after a long latent period . ``
It is interesting to note that although biallelic loss of function mutations in the RUNX ] gene have been found in leukemias , `` the frequency of chromosomal rearrangements of and CBFB in leukemias is greater .
Furthermore , biallelic mutations were observed in MO leukemias , which are minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemias , whereas the ( 8 ; 21 ) and inv ( 16 ) are found in the somewhat more differentiated M2 and M4 acute myeloid leukemia subtypes .
The difference in frequency and diagnostic subtypes suggests that the translocations and loss of function mutations involving RUNXI and CBFB are not equivalent in leukemogenesis .
The inability of CBFB-SMMHC and AML1-ETO to completely inhibit Runx1 : CBFB activity may be an essential feature of their distinct leukemogenic properties .
We were also able to document an intrinsic inability of CBFB-SMMHC to provide CBFB function in vivo , based on its failure to restore definitive hematopoiesis by Chfb_ ' `` - ES cells .
This observation could form the basis of an assay for evaluating the biochemical properties of the SMMHC sequences that inhibit its function in vivo , and for testing candidate drugs targeted against the CBFB-SMMHC protein .
