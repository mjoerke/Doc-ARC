We located the transcription initiation site and showed that the CD4 core promoter ( positions -40 to +16 ) lacks a classical `` TATA `` or initiator positioning consensus sequence but directs precise and efficient transcription when coupled to the ubiquitously active simian virus 40 enhancer .
The transcriptional activity of the CD4 gene promoter correlated with CD4 expression in various cell types .
Interestingly , the CD4 core promoter also displayed a tissue-specific transcriptional activity .
Within this fragment , three nucleic acid sequences are completely conserved in the murine CD4 gene .
One of these sequences contains a perfect ETS consensus sequence .
Another ETS consensus sequence is located 1060 nt upstream .
Electrophoretic-mobility-shift assays showed that the core promoter ETS motif binds an Ets-related protein specifically expressed at high levels in CD4+* cells .
Moreover , in CD4~ cells , overexpression of Ets-1 or Ets-2 efficiently and specifically activated transcription from the CD4 promoter and core promoter .
These data indicate that Ets transcription factors play a central role in controlling CD4 gene expression , by binding to both a classical remote site and an unusual proximal activator sequence .
The expression of the T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , and the CD4 and CD8 coreceptor molecules , is tightly regulated during T-lymphocyte differentiation in the thymus .
Early thymocytes express a low level of CD4 and no CD8 and have not yet rearranged their genes coding for the TCR ( for review , see ref .
1 ) .
Later , they express high levels of both CD4 and CD8 , as well as a rearranged TCR .
At this stage , most of the thymocytes undergo apoptosis , presumably because of the expression of an inappropriate set of receptor/coreceptor molecules .
The surviving thymocytes continue differentia-tion , losing the expression of either CD4 or CD8 , depending on whether their TCR is specific for antigen presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex class I or II molecules , respectively .
Experiments with transgenic mice ( 2 , 3 ) , suggest that the switch from CD4+*/CD8*+-double-positive thymocytes to single-positive lymphocytes is likely to be an instructive rather than a stochastic process .
Thus , the CD4 and CD8 molecules should control their mutual expression during the thymocyte maturation process .
Since the expression of CD4 and CD8 molecules is regulated at the transcriptional level ( 4 , 5 ) , the analysis of the CD4 and CD8 genes transcription control elements is essential to understand the complex regulation of their expression .
We mapped the human CD4 gene transcription start site and showed that the surrounding core promoter ( positions -40 to +16 ) is sufficient for precise initiation of transcription , The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .
This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement `` in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
7739 despite the absence of `` TATA `` or initiator sequences ( 6 , 7 ) .
The CD4 promoter is specifically active in CD4* cells , and the CD4 core promoter alone also displays a significant tissue-specific activity .
The CD4 promoter contains two sequences capable of binding Ets proteins , one located 1060 bp upstream from the start site and the second within the core promoter .
Ets proteins form a distinct family of transcription factors ( for review , see ref .
8 ) , two of which ( Ets-1 and Elf-1 ) bind regulatory sequences of T-cell-specific genes ( 9 , 10 ) .
We show that the CD4 core promoter binds Ets-like proteins specifically expressed at high amounts in CD4 * cells .
We also show that overexpression of Ets-1 or Ets-2 in CD4~ HeLa cells efficiently and specifically activates the CD4 promoter and core promoter .
Since T cells express multiple members of the Ets family ( 10-14 ) and since Ets-1 and Ets-2 are specifically expressed at high levels in CD4* thymocytes and lymphocytes ( 11 ) , we thus propose that Ets proteins play a central role in the tissue specificity of CD4 gene expression .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Phage , Plasmids , and Oligonucleotides .
The two distal EcoRI-HindIII fragments of phage AMP ( 24 ) were subcloned into pGEM-3Z ( Promega ) , sequenced , and aligned with cDNA 5 ' sequence ( see Fig .
1 ) .
Expression plasmids as follows were derived from pCAT vectors ( Promega ) : CAT-Control , simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) promoter plus enhancer ( named here SV40 ) ; CAT-Enhancer , SV40 enhancer alone ; CAT-Basic , no transcription sequences .
All subclonings were performed using classical methods ( 15 ) .
The CD4 Pst I fragment from positions -1076 to +20 ( Fig .
1A ) was cloned in the CAT-Basic , generating proT4 .
The CD4 core promoter , a CD4 synthetic double-strand oligonucleotide from positions -40 to +16 with HindIII and Xba I adapters ( named CD4 in Fig .
44 ) , was cloned in both CAT-Basic and CAT-Enhancer , generating pT4 and pT4+eSV , respectively .
Basic , proT4 , pT4 , and pT4+eSV cassettes were tested both in their original pUC19 ( pCAT vectors ) and in the Bluescript SK * ( Stratagene ) parental vectors , to test for the influence of plasmidic sequences .
For each construct , independent preparations of independent clones were prepared for functional assays .

sion essentially as described ( 15 ) .
For each primer extension , a plasmid containing a sequence overlapping the expected 5 ' ends of the RNAs was sequenced using the same 5'-end-*P-labeled oligonucleotide that was used for primer extension .
Sequencing reaction products were electrophoresed alongside the primer-extension products .
Mung bean nuclease protections were performed essentially as described ( 15 ) .
Conditions used in Fig .
3 are 280 mM NaCl and 100 units of mung bean nuclease ( Boehringer Mannheim ) for 1 h at 37°C .
The S'-end-P-labeled oligonucleotides were used as size markers .
Cells and Transfections .
Cells used in this study were Jurkat ( CD4+* mature T cell ) , CEM ( CD4+/CD8+* immature T cell ) , RPMI ( CD4~ pre T cell ) , U937 ( CD4+ monocytic cell ) , HeLa ( CD4~ epithelial cell ) , HepG2 ( CD4~- hepatocytic cell ) , and U373 ( CD4~ astrocytic cell , named here `` Astro `` to avoid confusion with U937 cells ) .
Cells were electrotransfected as described elsewhere ( ref .
20 and unpublished data ) .
Determination of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activity was performed 48 h later as described ( 15 ) and expressed as percentage of acetylated chloramphenicol .
Intraexperi-ment variations were controlled by cotransfection of the pSV control vector ( Promega ) and by determining the protein concentration of cell extracts .
For each construct , independent transfections were performed at least twice .
In Fig .
3 C and D , HeLa cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described ( 15 ) , with 0-5 ug of c-Ets-1 or c-Ets-2 expression vectors ( 21 ) , 5 ug of RSV-f & -galactosidase expression vector , and 5 ug of CD4-based or SV40 CAT plasmids .
CAT activities are expressed as cpm of monoacetylated [ '*CJchloramphenicol corrected for variations of the A-galactosidase internal control .
For each construct , three experiments with at least two preparations of DNA were performed .
The difference between individual experiments was no more than 20 % .
Stable transformants of CEM and Jurkat cells were obtained by cotransfection with a plasmid encoding the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene .
Electrophoretic-Mobility-Shift Assays .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described ( 22 ) .
Similar titers of octamer-binding factors were recovered from CEM and HeLa nuclear extracts .
Electrophoretic-mobility-shift assays were performed essentially as described ( 23 ) : Nuclear extract ( 10 ug ) were incubated in 20 ul of binding buffer containing 0.5-1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) -poly ( dI-dC ) and the appropriate competitor for 5 min at room temperature .
Then , 1 ng of P-labeled probe was added for a further 20-min incubation at room temperature .
Nucleoprotein complexes were resolved in a 6 % native polyacrylamide gel .
RESULTS Localization of the CD4 Transcription Start Site .
We used the 5 Hinfl fragment ( nt +12 to +198 in Fig .
1A ) of a human CD4 cDNA ( cDNA ? )
112 bp longer upstream than the first described human cDNA ( cDNA1 ) ( 5 ) to probe AMP , the most 5 ' human CD4 genomic clone described ( 24 ) .
Restriction mapping and sequencing of the hybridizing fragments identified a large 9.6-kb intron in the 5 ' untranslated region ( Fig .
1A ) .
Human and murine CD4 genes have thus a similar organization ( 16 , 17 ) .
Primer extension of CD4 mRNAs revealed a major transcript starting at an adenine ( +1 in all figures ) ( Fig .
24 ) , and minor transcripts starting at nt -9 , -1 , +2 , and +5 .
Mung bean nuclease mapping gave protected fragments corresponding to 5 ' ends located between nt +1 and +5 ( Fig .
2B ) , with a major protected fragment corresponding to nt +3 .
This apparent discrepancy , also observed under various stringency conditions , is presumably due to an overdigestion of the A+T-rich 5 ' end of the RNA-DNA duplexes ( 15 ) .
Start sites are identical in lymphoid ( CEM ) and monocytic ( U937 ) cells ( Fig .
2 A and B ) and are similar to those of the murine CD4 gene ( 16 ) .
A minimal human CD4 gene core promoter ( nt -40 to +16 ) linked to the SV40 enhancer and CAT gene ( construct pT4+eSV ) was used to generate stable transformants of CEM and Jurkat cells .

( C ) Transcription initiation from the CD4 core promoter .
Stable transformants of the CD4* cell lines CEM ( clone 3B3 ) and Jurkat ( clone A5 ) , expressing the CAT gene under the control of the pT4+eSV construct were analyzed by primer extension .
An oligonucleotide complementary to nt +3 to +42 of the CAT mRNA ( +1 being the first nucleotide of the CAT initiation codon ) was used as primer .
The major start site of CAT mRNAs is indicated by an arrow ( nt +1 ) , beside nt -15 to +12 of the coding strand .
CAT mRNAs showed that the majority of the CAT transcripts start at the +1 adenine of the CD4 core promoter ( Fig .
2C ) .
Structural Analysis of the Human CD4 Gene Promoter .
Despite precise initiation , there are no consensus sequences such as TATA box ( 6 ) , CAAT box ( 25 ) , or initiator ( 7 ) in the vicinity of the transcription start site .
We identified three ETS ( 8 ) and seven MYB ( 26 ) consensus sequences in the CD4 promoter region ( Fig .
1A ) .
Of the six MYB consensus sequences described in the murine CD4 promoter ( 16 ) , only two are found in the corresponding human region .
We found a significant conservation ( 64 % ) between human and mouse proximal promoter sequences ( nt -163 to +20 ; Fig .
1B ) , which is concentrated in five boxes of 100 % homology .
Three of these conserved boxes ( CB1-3 ) are located in the region from positions -35 to +15 , which is believed to be critical for the assembly of the RNA polymerase complex ( RPC ) ( 27 , 28 ) .
CBI and -3 are in places of the TATA box ( nt -35 to -27 ) ( 6 ) and initiator ( nt -3 to +5 ) ( 7 ) , respectively .
Interestingly , the CB2 sequence ( nt -18 to -7 ) is precisely the consensus binding site of Ets-1 [ RC ( C/A ) GGA ( A/T ) RY , minus strand , where R is a purine and Y is a pyrimidine ] , whereas the remote ETS sequence ( nt -1065 to -1057 ) is perfect for the binding of E74-related proteins [ YC ( C/A ) GGAART , minus strand ] ( 29 ) .

USA 90 ( 1993 ) 7741 CD4 Promoter and Core Promoter Tissue Specificity and Transactivation by Ets .
Compared to the ubiquitously active SV40 promoter , the CD4 promoter is tissue-specific ( Fig .
3A ) .
Its activity is similar to that of SV40 promoter in a mature CD4+* T-cell line ( Jurkat ) , 4-fold lower in CD4t monocytic cells ( U937 ) , and a least 10-fold lower in CD4~ cells , including the RPMI pre-T cells .
The activity of proT4 is also comparable to that of SV40 in an immature CD4*/ CD8+* T-cell line ( CEM , data not shown ) .
Surprisingly , the CD4 core promoter ( nt -40 to +16 ) alone exhibits a significant activity in Jurkat cells but not in HeLa cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
This indicates the presence of positive regulatory sequences both upstream and within the CD4 core promoter .
When the CD4 core promoter is coupled to the SV40 enhancer ( pT4+eSV ) , its transcriptional activity is similar in CD4* and CD4~ cells and is in the same order of magnitude as the SV40 promoter .
In CD4~ Hela cells , the activity of the CD4 promoter and core promoter can be restored by the expression of Ets-1 or Ets-2 .
The CD4 core promoter alone ( pT4 ) and to a greater extent the complete CD4 promoter ( proT4 ) are transactivated in a dose-dependent manner by Ets-1 or Ets-2 expression ( Fig .
3 C and D ) .
These Ets proteins did not significantly affect the SV 40 promoter activity .
These data show that both CD4 core promoter and upstream sequences are targets for activation by Ets proteins .
Binding of Ets-Like Proteins to the Human CD4 Core Promoter .
We performed gel-retardation assays with both the 56-bp CD4 core promoter sequence and a sequence containing an artificial ETS motif derived from the described consensus sequence ( 8 ) .
Incubation of a labeled CD4 probe with nuclear extracts from CD4* CEM cells gave three retarded bands ( C1 , C2 , and C3 ; Fig .
4B ) .
Preincubation with an excess of unlabeled CD4 , as well as unlabeled ETS motifs , inhibited the formation of the most intense C3 band , although with a lesser efficiency for ETS .
These different affinities of CD4 and ETS for the C3 protein ( s ) are most likely due to base differences between their Ets-binding sites ( 21 , 29 ) .
No significant inhibition was observed when using as competitors an altered ETS motif with a single C - T substitution ( MUT ) or a poly ( A ) oligonucleotide ( pA ) .
By using nuclear extracts from the CD4~ HeLa cells , the C1 and C2 bands displayed intensities comparable to bands of CEM extracts , whereas the C3 band was almost undetectable .
Furthermore , only the C3 band could be significantly inhibited by the CD4 unlabeled competitor .
Using the ETS double-strand oligonucleotide as probe , we observed a similar pattern of retarded bands .
Three bands ( El , E2 , and E3 ) were observed with nuclear extracts of CEM cells , whereas only two ( E1 and E2 ) were found with HeLa cells .
An excess of unlabeled ETS oligonucleotide inhibited the formation of E3 , although less efficiently than the CD4 oligonucleotide .
No significant inhibition was observed with MUT or the pA oligonucleotides ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION Structure and Tissue Specificity of the Human CD4 Promoter .
We showed that the transcription initiation of the CD4 gene is precise and that a genomic fragment from nt -1076 to +20 governs tissue-specific transcriptional activity in CD4+* cells .
Our results are in agreement with those recently reported ( 16 ) for a murine CD4 gene promoter fragment of similar size whose activity is restricted to mature CD4*/ CD8~ mouse lymphocytes .
Within the 1100-bp human fragment , we show that the region from positions -40 to +16 can direct precise transcription at the same site as natural CD4 mRNAs and displays a significant tissue-specific basal activity .
This latter feature is unusual for a minimal core promoter , although sequences of similar size have been 7742 Biochemistry : Salmon et al .

( A ) Cell-specific expression of the CD4 promoter .
CD4 + ( Jurkat and U937 ) and CD4~ ( RPMI , Hela , Astro , and HepG2 ) cell lines were electroporated with SV40 and proT4 plasmids in a pUC19 parental plasmid .

core promoter specifically binds an Ets protein present at high amounts specifically in CD4* cells .
Moreover , Ets-1 and Ets-2 activate the CD4 core promoter in the CD4~- HeLa cells , and preliminary experiments indicated that mutations within CB2 dramatically impairs activation by Ets ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it strongly suggests that Ets proteins are implicated in the transcriptional activity of the CD4 core promoter in CD4* cells , by activating the RPC from within .
As recently discussed for other TATA-less promoters , Ets proteins could participate in the building of a CD4-specific RPC ( 8 , 32 ) .
Independently , we show that the complete CD4 promoter is more active in CD4* cells and more strongly activated by Ets in CD4~ cells than the CD4 core promoter .
Thus , Ets proteins could also `` classically `` modulate CD4 gene expression by binding to the other remote upstream ETS site ( nt -1060 ) .
Ets proteins , whose prototype is the Ets-/ protooncogene , define a distinct class of transcriptional factors that bind several gene regulatory sequences containing the ETS core motif GGA ( for review , see ref .
8 ) .
Among these proteins , Ets-1 has been shown to control a T-cell-specific gene ( TCRa ) ( 9 ) , and Elf-1 is implicated in a T-helper-cell-specific gene expression ( interleukin 2 ) ( 10 ) .
Interestingly , the sequence of the distal ETS site was shown to be preferred by Elf-1-related proteins ( 29 ) .
Thus , the cooperation of these two proteins could be a key mechanism for CD4 gene restricted expression .
Ets-1 and Ets-2 are expressed at 10-fold higher levels in CD4+* thymocytes and lymphocytes than in their CD8+ counterparts ( 11 ) .
However , Ets-1 and Ets-2 are expressed at low but significant levels in CD8* lympho-cytes , whereas the CD4 gene expression is undetectable in these cells .
These apparent discrepancies might be explained by ( i ) the fact that Ets is not the sole determinant of CD4 promoter activity , ( ii ) a threshold effect of Ets expression on CD4 promoter activity , or ( ii ? )
the presence of interfering forms of Ets in CD4~ cells .
For optimal activity , Ets proteins seem to require the adjacent binding of another transcriptional factor ( for review , see ref .
8 ) , including Myb ( 33 ) .
Interestingly , Myb is also critical for CD4 promoter activity ( 16 ) , although it does not by itself significantly contribute to its tissue specificity .
Thus , the tissue-specific CD4 promoter activity could depend on the cooperation of Ets proteins , with Myb at the distal ETS-MYB overlapping sites , or with a general transcription factor at the CD4 core promoter ETS site .
Finally , preliminary experiments indicated that truncated forms of Ets containing only the DNA binding domain ( 34 ) dramatically decrease CD4 promoter activity in CD4 # cells ( data not shown ) .
Altogether , these results clearly indicate that Ets proteins play a central role in tissue-restricted CD4 gene expression .
However , the CD4-specific Ets proteins remain to be identified .
The CD4 Promoter and Thymocyte Phenotype Switching .
Experiments with transgenic mice suggested that the CD4 and CD8 proteins could control their mutual expression during thymocyte diffentiation ( 2 , 3 ) .
Such events could likely be triggered by p56 `` , a member of the v-src protein tyrosine kinase family that is associated with the intracyto-plasmic tails of these proteins ( 35 ) .
Indeed , ( i ) p56 `` phos-phorylates and activates mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases ( 36 ) , ( ii ) Ets phosphorylation by MAP kinase modifies its ability to form ternary complex with other transcription factors ( 37 ) , and ( ii ? )
v-src has been shown to modulate Ets transcriptional activity ( 23 ) .
Thus , Ets could be the nuclear target of extracellular signals that might trigger thymocyte phenotype switch .
We thank M. Dowling for his participation to preliminary experiments and R. Axel for providing the AMP CD4 genomic clone and constant support for this project .
