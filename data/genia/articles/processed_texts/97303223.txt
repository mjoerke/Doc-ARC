Good , University of South Florida , St. Petersburg , FL , March 27 , 1997 ( received for review November 11 , 1996 ) ABSTRACT The cytokines interleukin ( IL ) -4 and IL-13 play a critical role in inducing C # germline transcripts and IgE isotype switching in human B cells .
The IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) in B cells is composed of two chains , the IL-4-binding IL-4Ra chain , which is shared with the IL-13R , and the IL-2Ry ( yc ) chain , which is shared with IL-7R , IL-9R , and IL-15R .
IL-4 induces C # germline transcripts and IgE isotype switching in B cells from patients with yc chain deficiency .
Induction of C & germline transcripts by IL-4 in B cells that lack the yc chain may involve signaling via the IL-13R .
Alternatively , the IL-4Ra chain may transduce intracellular signals that lead to C # gene transcription independently of its association with other chains .
We show that ligand-induced homodimerization of chimeric surface receptors consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the erythropoietin receptor and of the intracellular domain of IL-4Ra induces Janus kinase 1 ( Jak1l ) activation , STAT6 activation , and C & germline transcripts in human B cell line BJAB .
Disruption of the Jak1-binding proline-rich Box1 region of IL-4Ra abolished signaling by this chimeric receptor .
Fur-thermore , B cells transfected with a chimeric CD8a @ /IL-4Ra « receptor , which is expressed on the cell surface as a ho-modimer , constitutively expressed C & germline transcripts .
These results suggest that homodimerization of the IL-4Ra « chain is sufficient to transduce Jakl-dependent intracellular signals that lead to IgE isotype switching .
IgE synthesis by B cells requires two signals , the cytokine interleukin 4 ( IL-4 ) that induces transcription of the C # gene , targeting it for switch recombination , and interaction of the B cell surface antigen CD40 with its ligand ( CD4O0L ) expressed on activated T cells , which results in deletional switch recombination ( 1 ) .
In humans , the cytokine IL-13 duplicates the function of IL-4 in inducing IgE isotype switching ( 2 ) .
The IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) on lymphoid cells is composed of two chains , the IL-4-binding 140-kDa IL-4Ra chain that is shared with the IL-13R ( 3 ) , and the IL-2Ry ( yc ) chain ( 4 ) that is also shared with IL-7R , IL-9R , and IL-15R ( 5 ) and that is mutated in boys with X-linked severe combined immunode-ficiency ( X-SCID ) ( 6 ) .
IL-4Ra and yc respectively associate with the Janus kinases Jak1 and Jak3 ( 7 ) .
Ligand-induced heterodimerization of IL-4Ra and yc chains in lymphoid cells induces phosphorylation and activation of Jak1 and Jak3 and tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-4Ra chain ( 8 ) .
Phosphorylated tyrosine residues of IL-4Ra chain serve as anchor for the SH2 domain of the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT6 , The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

5866 which in turn gets phosphorylated ( 9 ) .
Phosphorylated STAT6 form homodimers that translocate to the nucleus where they bind to DNA sequences TTCNNN ( N ) GAA in the promoter region of IL-4 responsive genes , including Cs ( 10 , 11 ) .
The IL-13R complex is supposed to consist of two chains , an IL-13-binding IL-13Ra « chain ( 12 , 13 ) and the IL-4Ra chain ( 3 ) .
yc chain is not a component of IL-13R ( 14 ) .
Although IL-13 activates STAT6 and induces Cs germline transcripts ( 15 ) , it does not activate Jak3 .
The role of individual IL-4R chains in the induction of Cs gene transcription is not very well defined .
It was recently shown that IL-4 induces Cs germline transcripts and IgE isotype switching in B cells from patients with X-SCID and mutated yc chain ( 15 , 16 ) .
Induction of Cs gene transcription by IL-4 in B cells with yc chain-deficiency may involve signaling via the IL-4Ra-containing IL-13 receptor .
Alternatively , the IL-4Ra chain by itself may transduce intracellular signals that lead to Cs gene transcription .
In this study , we show that homodimerization of the intracellular domain of the human IL-4Ra chain induces Cs germline transcripts .
This was accompanied by Jak1 activation and induction of nuclear STAT6 DNA binding activity and was abolished by disruption of the Jak1-binding proline-rich Box1 region of IL-4Ra .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Generation of Erythropoietin Receptor ( EpoR ) /IL-4Ra « and CD8 @ /IL-4Ra Chain Chimeras .
To generate a chimeric cDNA encoding the extracellular ( EC ) and the transmembrane ( TM ) domains of murine EpoR ( muEpoR ) fused to the intracellular ( IC ) domain of the human IL-4Ra chain , overlapping PCR fragments encompassing the appropriate regions of EpoR and IL-4Ra were annealed in a two-step overlap extension PCR as previously described ( 17 ) .
MuEpoR cDNA was a gift of B. Mathey-Prevot ( Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston ) .
Human IL-4R cDNA was a gift of P. Leder and D. Seldin ( Harvard Medical School ) .
The PCR products that consist of the EpoR-EC and TM domains fused to the IL-4Ra IC domain , were gel purified , cloned into the PCR II vector ( Invitrogen ) , sequenced , and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 ( Invitrogen ) containing the neomycin resistance gene .
As a control vector , full-length EpoR cDNA was subcloned into peDNA3 .
A chimera consisting of the EC and TM domains of human CD8a and the IC domain of IL-4Ra ( CDS8gc+rm/IL-4Rarc ) was also constructed by the overlap extension PCR using human CD8a « cDNA ( a gift of L.

construct .
The intensity of EpoR staining on cells expressing EpoR and on cells expressing EpoR/IL-4R « chimeric protein was roughly equivalent .
We therefore examined whether homodimerization of the EpoR/IL-4Ra chimeric receptor by Epo in BJA B cells mimics IL-4 signaling via native IL-4R in causing Cs gene transcription .
We used recombinant human Epo in our studies because it is readily available and has been shown to bind to muEpoR and to signal via muEpoR ( 21 ) .
Fig .
1B shows that incubation with IL-4 for five days induced Cs gene transcripts in BJAB cells transfected with empty vector , with EpoR , or with EpoR/IL-4Ra ( lanes 7-9 ) , whereas no Ces gene transcripts were detected in cells incubated with medium alone ( lanes 1-3 ) .
Epo induced Cs gene transcripts only in BJAB cells that were transfected with EpoR/IL-4Ra chimeric receptor ( lane 6 ) , and not in BJA B cells transfected with empty vector or with full-length EpoR ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
These results strongly suggest that homodimerization of the IL-4Ra chain is sufficient to transduce an intracellular signal that results in Cs gene transcription .
Expression of CD8/IL-4Ra Homodimers in BJAB Cells Results in Constitutive Expression of Cg Gene Transcripts .
CD8a is expressed at the cell surface as a homodimer as long as it has its own EC and TM domains ( 22 , 23 ) .
To confirm that homodimerization of IL-4Ra is sufficient to induce Cs gene transcripts in B cells , we examined Cs germline transcripts in BJAB cells transfected with a CD8gc+rm/IL-4Raorc chimeric construct , or with a full-length CD8 , or with a vector alone .
The cells were grown in hygromycin containing medium and were examined from day 13 on for surface CD8 expression by FACS analysis and for expression of Cs gene transcripts by Northern blotting .
Fig .
24 shows that 13 days after transfection , CD8 was expressed on the surface of BJAB cells transfected with the native CD8 construct as well as on the surface of BJAB cells transfected with the chimeric CD8/IL-4Ra construct .
Subsequent to day 13 , CD8 surface expression progressively diminished until the end of the experiment on day 21 ( data not shown ) .
Fig .
2B shows that Cs gene transcripts were constitutively expressed on day 13 in BJAB cells that expressed the CD8/ IL-4Ra chimeric receptor .
Expression of the Cs gene transcripts in these cells persisted at days 15 , 18 , and 21 , although its level progressively diminished with time .
Cs gene transcripts were not detected at any time in BJA B cells transfected with empty vector or with the full-length CD8a construct , although both transfectants expressed Cs gene transcripts following treatment with IL-4 for five days ( data not shown ) .
These data support the notion that homodimerization of the IL-4Ra chain is sufficient for the induction of Cs gene transcripts .
Homodimerization of IL-4Ra Chains Induces STAT6 Acti-vation .
We examined whether homodimerization of the IL-4Ra chain induced nuclear STAT6 activity .
Fig .
34 shows that IL-4 induced a nuclear complex in BJAB cells transfected with empty vector , EpoR and EpoR/IL-4R « ( lanes 7-9 ) whereas no nuclear complex was detected in cells incubated with medium alone ( lanes 1-3 ) .
Epo induced a nuclear complex only in BJAB cells that were transfected with EpoR/IL-4Ra ( lane 6 ) and not in BJAB cells transfected with EpoR or empty vector .
The nuclear complex induced in BJAB transfected with EpoR/IL-4Ra by Epo comigrated with the nuclear complex induced in BJAB cells by IL-4 signaling via the native IL-4R , suggesting that it contained STAT6 .
Fig .
3B shows that the nuclear complex induced by Epo in BJAB cells expressing EpoR/IL-4Ra « chimeric receptors is specific and , like the nuclear complex induced by IL-4 , contains STAT6 .

Taken together , these data indicate that homodimerization of the IL-4Ra chain induces STAT6 nuclear activity .
Homodimerization of IL-4Ra Chains Induces Jak ] Activa-tion .
We examined whether homodimerization of IL-4Ra chain by itself results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-4Ra-associated Jak1 , in the absence of recruitment of the rye chain and of its associated Jak3 .

Cells from intact EpoR/IL-4Ra transfectants ( 4 and B ) and EpoR/IL-4Ra Box1 mutants transfectants ( B ) were stimulated with Epo ( 300 units/ml ) or IL-4 ( 1,200 units/ml ) for the indicated periods of time ( 4 ) or for 10 min ( B ) .

Disruption of Box1 in the EpoR/IL-4Ra Chimeric Receptor Abolishes Epo-Mediated Induction of Cs Germline Transcripts .
The membrane proximal proline-rich Box1 region of the IC domain of cytokine receptors is critical for association with Jak kinases ( 24 ) , including Jak1 ( 25 ) .
To ascertain that Jak1 is involved in signal transduction following homodimerization of IL-4Ra , we examined the effect of disruption of Box1 in the EpoR/IL-4Ra chimeric construct on the induction of C & transcripts .
Two independent EpoR/IL-4Ra Box1 deletion mutants that lacked the sequences 237 WWDQIPNP 244 ( Box1 mut 1 ) and 242 PNP 244 ( Box1 mut 2 ) respectively , were stably transfected in BJAB cells .
Expression of the mutated EpoR/IL-4R « chimeric receptor was equivalent to that shown in Fig .
14 for BJAB cells stably transfected with EpoR/IL-4Ra ( data not shown ) .
Fig .
4B shows that BJAB cell lines transfected with EpoR/ IL-4Ra Box1 deletion mutants had high baseline tyrosine phosphorylation ( lanes 4 and 7 ) .
Engagement of the native IL-4R complex by IL-4 induced increased Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation in both of these cell lines ( lanes 6 and 9 ) .
In contrast , homodimerization of the mutated EpoR/IL-4Ra 5870 Medical Sciences : Fujiwara et al .
chimeric receptors by Epo failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 ( lanes 5 and 8 ) .
These results strongly suggest that disruption of Box1 abolished the capacity of the mutant receptors to associate with and activate Jak1 .
Fig .
5 shows that ligation of the mutated chimeric receptors with Epo failed to induce Cs germline transcripts , whereas ligation of the native IL-4R with IL-4 in the same cells induced it .
These results suggest that Jak1 is critical for the induction of Cs germline transcripts following homodimerization of IL-4Ra chains .
DISCUSSION Our data demonstrates that homodimerization of the IL-4Ra chain induces Cs germline transcripts in human B cells .
This was accompanied by activation of Jak1 kinase and by induction of STAT6 nuclear activity and was abolished by disruption of the membrane proximal Box1 proline-rich region of IL-4Ra « .
The present study was prompted by the observation that IL-4 induces Cs gene transcription and causes IgE synthesis in B cells from patients with X-SCID ( 15 , 16 ) .
Induction of Cs gene transcription by IL-4 in these B cells may have involved signaling via the IL-13R complex , which shares the IL-4Ra chain with the IL-4R complex .
We considered the possibility that the IL-4Ra chain by itself may be able to transduce an intracellular signal that leads to Cs gene transcription independently of its association with other chains .
This was shown to be the case because ligation of a chimeric EpoR/IL-4Ra receptor expressed on B cells by Epo resulted in Cs gene transcription ( Fig .
18 ) .

USA 94 ( 1997 ) of a transfected muEpoR failed to induce Cs gene transcripts in BJAB cells .
Since the rabbit anti-EpoR antibody we used in the FACS analysis to detect muEpoR expression was raised against and recognizes human EpoR , the lack of detectable EpoR expression on BJAB cells ( Fig .
14 ) strongly suggests that these cells do not express endogenous human EpoR protein .
Moreover , we were unable to detect human EpoR mRNA in BJAB cells by reverse transcription-PCR analysis ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it is unlikely that induction of Cs gene transcripts by Epo-ligation of the chimeric EpoR/IL-4Ra receptor involved cooperative signaling by an endogenous EpoR and by the muEpoR component of the chimeric receptor .
Homodimerization of IL-4Ra « was essential for induction of Cs gene transcripts because these transcripts were detected in cells expressing the chimeric EpoR/IL-4Ra receptor only after treatment with Epo .
In contrast , Cs gene transcripts were constitutively expressed in B cells that expressed a chimeric CD8 receptor as a homodimer ( Fig .
2 ) .
The fact that Cs gene transcripts were induced by two independent models of IL-4Ra homodimerization strongly suggests that homodimerization of the intracellular domain of the IL-4Ra chain is sufficient to transduce a signal that results in Cs gene transcription .
STAT6 plays a critical role in Cs germline transcription in response to IL-4 as evidenced by the failure of B cells from mice homozygous for disruption of the STAT6 gene to transcribe the Ces gene in response to IL-4 ( 26 ) .
STAT6 binding to the sequence TTCCCAAGAA of the human germline s promoter situated between -159 and -133 bp of the Is exon is essential for the activation of Cs germline transcription in B cells , possibly by derepressing the promoter ( 27 ) .
Induction of STAT6 by IL-4 has been observed in B cells from patients with X-SCID by some authors ( 28 ) but not others ( 15 ) .
Induction of STAT6 activity by IL-4 in X-SCID B cells is consistent with the ability of IL-4 to induce IgE switching in these B cells ( 16 ) .
In our study , STAT6 nuclear activity was readily induced by homodimerization of the chimeric EpoR/IL-4Ra « receptor ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus homodimerization of the IL-4Ra chain is sufficient to induce STAT6 activity .
As previously reported ( 29 , 30 , 31 ) , ligation of the native IL-4R resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 ( Fig .
44 ) and Jak1 ( Fig .
4B ) .
Not surprisingly , homodimerization of the chimeric EpoR/IL-4Ra « by Epo resulted in no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 ( Fig .
44 ) .
However it caused an increase in Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation equivalent to that seen with ligation of the native IL-4R ( Fig .
4B ) .
Dimerization of receptor chains that are associated with Jak kinases is thought to result in transphosphorylation and activation of these kinases .
To date , receptor-mediated Jakl activation has been accompanied by activation of other members of the Jak kinase family .
We were unable to detect activation of any other known member of the Jak kinase family following ligation of the chimeric EpoR/IL-4Ra « receptor .
Our data suggests that following homodimerization of chimeric EpoR/IL-4Ra chains , Jak1 molecules would transphosphory-late and activate each other .
Thus , Jak1 in the IL-4Ra homodimer may replace the function of Jak3 in the IL-4Ra/yc heterodimer .
This is consistent with recent observations that the Jaks are interchangeable and indiscriminative in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway ( 32-34 ) .
Two mutations that disrupted the presumptive Jak1 anchoring site of the proline-rich Box1 region in IL-4Ra abrogated Jak1 phosphorylation ( Fig .
4B ) , STAT6 activation ( data not shown ) and Ce germline transcription following receptor homodimerization .
These results suggest that Jak1 is required for the induction of Cs transcription following homodimerization of the IL-4Ra chain .
We can not formally rule out a role for proteins other than Jak1 that may bind to the Box1 region of IL-4Ra .
Experiments in B cells transfected with a dominant Medical Sciences : Fujiwara et al .
negative Jakl mutant or deficient in Jak1 are needed to definitively establish that Jak1 is essential for the induction of Cs gene transcription following homodimerization of the IL-4Ra chain .
While this manuscript was in preparation , two groups showed that homodimerization of human IL-4Ra « chains transfected in 32D cells expressing the IRS-1 ( murine promyeloid cell line ) or Ba/F3 cells ( murine pro-B cell line ) result in cellular proliferation ( 28 , 35 ) .
Thus , the IL-4R « chain is principally responsible for directing at least two signaling events triggered by IL-4 , proliferation and Cs gene transcription .
Although there is no direct evidence for homomeric IL-4Ra receptors , homodimerization of the IL-4Ra chain by IL-4 could occur .
The cytokine IL-2 has been shown to spontaneously form covalent dimers in vitro , possibly by trans-glutamination ( 36 ) , and self-association of IL-2 bound to its receptor has been demonstrated ( 37 ) .
Given the structural similarity between IL-4 and IL-2 , it is possible that IL-4 may also under certain conditions form dimers .
