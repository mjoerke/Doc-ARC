18 5495 Astrocytes and glioblastoma cells express novel octamer-DNA binding proteins distinct from the ubiquitous Oct-1 and B cell type Oct-2 proteins Edgar Schreiber* , Keith Harshman , Iris Kemler , Ursula Malipiero ' , Walter Schaffner and Adriano Fontana ' Institut fur Molekularbiologie II der Universitat Zurich , HOnggerberg , 8093 Zurich and 'Abteilung fur Klinische Immunologie , Departement fur Innere Medizin , Universitatsspital , Haldeliweg 4 , 8044 Zurich , Switzerland Received May 25 , 1990 ; Revised and Accepted August 15 , 1990 ABSTRACT The 'octamer ' sequence , ATGCAAAT or its complement ATTTGCAT , is a key element for the transcriptional regulation of immunoglobulin genes in B-lymphocytes as well as a number of housekeeping genes in all cell types .
In lymphocytes , the octamer-binding protein Oct-2A and variants thereof are thought to contribute to the B-cell specific gene expression , while the ubiquitous protein Oct-1 seems to control general octamer site-dependent transcription .
Various other genes , for example interleukin-1 and MHC class II genes , contain an octamer sequence in the promoter and are expressed in cells of both the immune and nervous systems .
This prompted us to analyze the octamer-binding proteins in the latter cells .
Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , at least six novel octamer binding proteins were detected in nuclear extracts of cultured mouse astrocytes .
These proteins are differentially expressed in human glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines .
The nervous system-derived ( N-Oct ) proteins bound to the octamer DNA sequence in a manner which is indistinguishable from the Oct-1 and Oct-2A proteins .
The relationship of the N-Oct proteins to Oct-1 and Oct-2A was analyzed by proteolytic clipping bandshift assays and by their reactivity towards antisera raised against recombinant Oct-1 and Oct-2A proteins .
On the basis of these assays , all N-Oct-factors were found to be distinct from the ubiquitous Oct-1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct-2A proteins .
In melanoma cells that contain the N-Oct-3 factor , a transfected lymphocyte-specific promoter was neither activated nor was it repressed upon co-transfection with an Oct-2A expression vector .
We therefore speculate that N-Oct-3 and other N-Oct factors have a specific role in gene expression in cells of the nervous system .
INTRODUCTION The selectivity of tissue-specific gene expression depends primarily on the interplay of transcription factors present in a given cell type with their cognate recognition sequences in the promoter and enhancer regions of the gene to be transcribed ( for review see Maniatis et al .
1987 , Miiller et al .
1988a ) .
The particular arrangement of the DNA modules forming these control elements allows distinct regulatory factors to function coordinately in potentiating messenger RNA synthesis ( for review see Ptashne 1988 ; Johnson and McKnight , 1989 ; Mitchell and Tjian,1989 ) .
The octamer sequence motif , ATGCAAAT ( or its complement ATTTGCAT ) , is a paradigm of a regulatory element employed in transcriptional activation of both ubiquitously expressed genes and cell-type specific genes ( reviewed in Schreiber et al .
1989 ) .
The octamer motif , first identified in the promoters of the histone H2B gene ( Harvey et al .
1982 ) and in the light chain and heavy chain immunoglobulin genes ( Falkner and Zachau , 1984 ; Parslow et al .
, 1984 ) , is now recognized , with a certain degree of sequence variation , to be an important element in the promoters and enhancers of a number of tissue-specific eukaryotic genes .
Interestingly , included in this octamer-responsive group are a number of genes , such as the human T cell receptor B-chain enhancer ( Krimpenfort et al .
1988 ) , and the major histocompatibility antigen complex ( MHC class II ) HLA DQB2 and DRa ( Miwa and Strominger 1987 , Sherman et al .
1989 ) the expression of which is cell-type specific but not restricted to B-cells .
In addition , the octamer sequence is also present in the control regions of many housekeeping genes such as the U2 small nuclear RNA genes as well as some viruses , e.g .
SV40 virus , herpes simplex virus and Adenovirus ( reviewed in Schreiber et al .
1989 ) .
The apparent selective use of the octamer sequence element in promoting ubiquitous and cell type-specific gene expression may be accomplished by the selective binding of a ubiquitously present octamer binding protein ( Oct-1 ) or cell type-specific octamer binding proteins ( Oct-2A and Oct-2B ) , respectively ( for Ref .
see Miiller et al .
1988a and Schreiber et * To whom correspondence should be addressed 5496 Nucleic Acids Research , Vol .

1989 ) .
Alternatively , the presence and position of other factor binding sites might influence the exhibited affinity for the octamer binding site .
Of course , relative intracellular/ ( nuclear ) concentration of all factors could influence octamer-site occupancy in both models .
The cDNAs encoding the ubiquitously expressed Oct-1 and the lymphoid-specific Oct-2A proteins have been cloned ( Sturm et al .
1988 , Miiller et al .
1988b ; Staudt et al .
1988 , Clerc et al .
1988 , Scheidereit et al .
1988 ) .
Ectopic overexpression of the Oct-2A cDNA in a non-lymphoid cell led to transcription activation of a lymphoid-specific promoter construction consisting of an octamer site with a TATA-box ( Miller et al .
1988b ) .
This result suggests that in different cell types the transcriptional selectivity of octamer-containing genes depends on the presence of different cell type-specific octamer binding proteins .
Indeed , the list of Oct-binding proteins with novel tissue distributions is increasingly long : Barberis et al .
( 1987 ) reported on a testis-specific Oct- protein in sea urchin and Cox et al .
( 1988 ) noted a novel Oct-protein in extracts from a melanoma cell line ; a developmentally regulated octamer-binding acivity in F9 embryocarcinoma cells was described ( Lenardo et al .
, 1989 ; Scholer et al .
1989 ) ; a broad overview of novel octamer binding proteins present in various organs , including brain and embryonic tissues from mouse and rat was described by Scholer et al .
( 1989 ) ; three Oct-related transcripts were isolated from rat brain mRNA by 'PCR-cloning ' and shown to hybridize selectively to different regions in the brain ( He et al .
1989 ) .
An indication of expression of Oct-2 mRNA in certain glioma cell lines was given by Staudt et al .
( 1988 ) .
All of these data point to the existence of a large but related family of octamer-binding proteins having a wide and varied tissue distribution .
In the present study we have investigated in more detail the presence of octamer binding proteins in cultured mouse astrocytes as well as a wide variety of transformed cells of the nervous system and have thoroughly analyzed their relationship to known Oct-proteins .
We demonstrate that the astrocytes express novel octamer binding proteins which we have termed N-Oct-2 « and B , N-Oct-3 , N-Oct-4 and N-Oct-5a/5b .
Data are presented which describe the differential expression of these proteins in nervous system derived tumor cells , and characterize the biochemical features of these proteins as well as the role of N-Oct-3 in transcription activation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and preparation of nuclear extracts BJA-B cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium ( Sigma ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug streptomycin .
The nervous system derived tumor cell lines tested consisted of four well characterized human glioblastoma cell lines ( line LN-18 , 309 , 382 , 215 ) , three neuroblastoma cell lines ( line LAN-1 , SK-N-BE and SK-N-LE ) , and one melanoma line ( Bowes ) and were kindly provided by Dr. N. de Tribolet , Neurosurgical Service , Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois , CH-1011 Lausanne , Switzerland .
Rat C6 glioma cells were obtained from Flow Laboratories .

The cells were grown in culture flasks ( Falcon , 175 cm growth area ) in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS and L-glutamin ( 0.3 mg/ml ) .
Astrocytes were prepared from brain of newborn ICR +/+ mice and cultured as described by Frei et al .
, 1987 .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Schreiber et al .
( 1989 ) with minor modifications : buffers A and C contained Leupeptin ( Boehringer Mannheim ) as an additional protease inhibitor at 4 ug/ ml buffer while Buffer C contained 20 % Glycerol .
Methylation interference assay This assay ( Siebenlist and Gilbert , 1980 ) was performed as described by Kemler et al .
( 1989 ) .
Preparative SDS-PAGE and renaturation of DNA-binding activity These procedures were performed as described by Schreiber et al .
( 1988 ) with minor modifications : a 12 % SDS-PAGE gel was used and the guanidiniumhydrochloride denatured nuclear proteins were renatured by adding 50 gl buffer X50 without glycerol and microdialyzed against 200 ml buffer X50 with 20 % glycerol for 12 hrs at 4 °C .
Preparation of Oct-1 and Oct-2a Antisera Recombinant Oct-1 and Oct-2a were used as antigens for the production of polyclonal antisera .
The Oct-2a cDNA ( Miiller et al .
, 1988 ) and a 3 ' truncation of the Oct-1 cDNA ( Sturm et al .
, 1988 ) were expressed in E. coli under the control of an IPTG-inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene ( Studier and Moffat , 1986 ) .
Following induction , the insoluble recombinant protein was isolated in the inclusion body fraction and injected ( 150 ug ) without further purification into New Zealand white rabbits .
The rabbits were boosted ( 100 4g ) 3 weeks following the first injection and tested for an immune response by Western blotting after an additional 10 days .
Both sera were determined to have sufficiently high titers and were used without purification in the described experiments .
Probes for bandshift analysis The Ddel-Hinfl fragment ( nucleotides position 518-566 ) from the IgH enhancer was subcloned into the Sall-site of pUC18 .
A 51 bp Sall-fragment was prepared from this clone , dephosphorylated with CLAP ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , and 5'-end labelled with y- > % p-ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase .
A specific activity of 1x 10®/pmol 5'-end was usually achieved .
For competition experiments , an unlabelled fragment containing 4 copies of the above mentioned sequence was used ( octa+ ) ; the ( octa- ) fragment contained 4 copies of a sequence in which the octanucleotide motif was eliminated by mutation from ATGCAAAT to CTGAACAT .
Bandshift assay and proteolytic clipping The procedures were performed exactly as described by Schreiber et al .
( 1988 ) Transfections and RNase protection mapping .

( 1988b ) .
Construct C in this study is identical to plasmid pbG ( Banerji et al .
1981 ) containing the SV40 enhancer 3 ' of the rabbit 3-globin gene .
COS-7 and Bowes melanoma cells were split the day before transfection ; at the time of transfection a confluency of 50 % was usually desired .
10 ug of reporter plasmid was mixed with 3 ug of OVEC-REF ( Westin et al .
1987 ) , the internal standard , and 5 ug of sonicated herring sperm carrier DNA and applied as coprecipitates to the cells for 12 hrs ; 3 ml of a 25 % solution DMSO was given to the TBS-washed cells for 3 min and after its removal the cells were incubated in 10 ml medium for 30 more hrs .
Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted according to Gough ( 1988 ) and the RNase protection assay with a B-globin SP96 riboprobe was performed as described by Miiller et al .
( 1988b ) .
RESULTS Nervous system-derived tumor cell lines contain novel octamer binding proteins Nuclear extracts were prepared from seven neuroblast cell lines : four human glioblastoma cell lines ( line LN-18 , 308 , 382 and Nucleic Acids Research , Vol .

18 5497 215 ) and three human neuroblastoma cell lines ( line LAN-1 , SK-N-BE and SK-N-LE ) .
Furthermore , one human melanoma cell line ( BOWES ) was included as a control in the study , as melanocytes , like neuroblasts , originate from the neuroepithelial plate .
Nuclear extracts containing the thoroughly characterized tissue-specific octamer binding proteins Oct-2A and Oct-2B were prepared from BJA-B lymphocytes .
Nuclear extracts from COS-7 monkey kidney epithelial-like cells and from mouse L-cells ( fibroblasts ) , prepared in the same manner and with the same buffers as the other samples , were included as ( non tissue-specific ) controls containing only Oct-1 protein .

The origin of the cell lines is described in Materials and Methods .
The schematic drawing on the right half illustrates the bandshift pattern and nomenclature of Oct-proteins in B-lymphocytes and nervous system derived tumor cell lines .
The radiolabelled probe was the 51 bp Ddel-Hinfl fragment from the mouse IgH enhancer that contains the octamer sequence , ATTTGCAT .
Figure 1B : Expression of octamer DNA binding proteins in the brain .
Extracts prepared from cultured murine astrocytes ( lane 3 ) , rat C6 glioma cells ( lane 4 ) , or from homogenized brain of either newborn ( lane 2 ) or 14 day old mice ( lane 1 ) were tested in the bandshift assay and compared with the retardation pattern of BJA-B lymphocytes ( lane 5 ) .
Figure 1C : Specificity of the octamer binding activities of nuclear extracts prepared from cells of the nervous system .
The specificity of the retarded complexes formed by Oct-proteins of the various cells indicated is demonstrated by addition of excess unlabelled competitor DNA containing either the intact octamer motif ( Ddel-Hinfl IgH enhancer fragment described in Material and Methods ) or a mutated octamer motif differing in three out of eight nucleotides ( see Material and Methods ) .

18 A radiolabelled 51 bp Ddel-Hinfl octamer-containing fragment from the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer was incubated with these extracts to test their octamer binding activity in the electrophoretic mobility shift ( bandshift ) assay .
As shown in Figure 1A , extracts from BJA-B lymphocytes give rise to three prominent protein DNA complexes in a long-run bandshift experiment ( lane 1 ) .
The slowest migrating complex is due to binding of Oct-1 , the ubiquitously expressed protein .
The second most retarded complex is due to binding of the lymphocyte-specific protein Oct-2B followed by the most prominent Oct-2A protein complex ( Schreiber et al .
1988 ; Miller et al .
1988b ) .
In addition to these previously described Oct-protein complexes , we noted a faint and faster migrating band at the lower end of the Oct-2A complex .
We tentatively designated this binding activity Oct-2C .
By analyzing tumor cell lines derived from the nervous system , several octamer-DNA protein complexes were detected ( lanes 2-9 ) : 1 ) a typical Oct-1 complex indistinguishable from the Oct-1 complex in BJA-B nuclear extracts , 2 ) a doublet band designated N-Oct-2 ( N-for nervous system ) , which migrates close to , but slightly slower than the Oct-2A complex from BJA-B cells , and 3 ) a faster migrating DNA-protein complex termed N-Oct-3 which co-migrates with the Oct-2C complex in BJA-B extracts .
Unlike lymphocyte nuclear extracts , none of the extracts from the different human nervous system cell lines displayed the Oct-2B complex .
It was not possible to distinguish the cell lines according to their origin as neuroblastoma , glioblastoma or melanoma based on the composition of Oct-proteins in the corresponding nuclear extracts .
The Oct-1 protein was present in nuclear cell extracts of all cell lines tested ; the combination of Oct-1 with N-Oct-3 or Oct-1 together with N-Oct-2 and N-Oct-3 was observed in some glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines .
None of the cell lines expressed N-Oct-2 in the absence of N-Oct-3 .
In COS-7 cells , L-cells ( lanes 10 and 11 ) , and HeLa cells ( data not shown ) only the Oct-1 protein was detected .
To show that the novel complexes detected are not due to proteolytic degradation occuring during extract preparation with these particular cell lines , we examined the integrity of high molecular weight proteins in these extracts by comparative SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , we performed a comparative bandshift experiment with these extracts , a BJA-B extract , and an Sp1-transcription factor binding site .
All extracts produced bandshifts characteristic of the presence of un-proteolyzed Spl ( data not shown ) .
Presence of additional N-Oct proteins in extracts from cultured astrocytes To rule out the formal possibility that the novel octamer factors were only detectable in long-term cultured human tumor cell lines , we tested for their presence in extracts from cultured astrocytes derived from brains of newborn mice and from extracts prepared from total brain of adult and newborn mice .
We included in this experiment a rat glioma cell line ( C6 ) to ask whether the novel Oct-complexes are conserved inter-species .
As shown in Figure 1B , ( lane 4 ) , the extract from the C6 cells also produced the Oct-1 and the N-Oct-3 complex .
In addition to these , three more complexes were detected with the astrocytes ( lane 3 ) and brain extracts ( lane 1 and 2 ) : the N-Oct-2 complex , a faint complex , termed N-Oct-4 , running below N-Oct-3 , and two fast , comigrating complexes , referred to as N-Oct-S5a and N-Oct-5b .
The N-Oct-Sa/b complexes were less abundant in human SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells ( Fig .
1A , lane 7 ) .
The same data were obtained when nuclear extracts were taken from astrocyte cultures established from newborn rats as described by Massa et al .
( 1987 ) ( data not shown ) .
We conclude that astrocytes , but not the various glioblastoma or neuroblastoma tumor cell lines , contain the full spectrum of Oct-proteins in the nervous system : N-Oct-2 , N-Oct-3 , N-Oct-4 , N-Oct-5a/b and the ubiquitous Oct-1 protein .
Identical DNA binding specificity of B-cell derived Oct-2 and N-Oct-2 and N-Oct-3 The specificity of the octamer DNA-protein interactions was analyzed by competition binding experiments .
A 500-fold molar excess of an unlabelled oligonucleotide containing either the wildtype octamer sequence ( ATGCAAAT ) or a mutated octamer ( CTGAACAT ) was used to compete for binding of nuclear proteins to the radiolabelled bandshift probe .
As shown in Figure 1C , the binding of Oct-1 , N-Oct-2 , N-Oct-3 and N-Oct-5a/b was efficiently competed by an unlabelled DNA containing the genuine octamer binding site ( lanes 7-12 ) .
In contrast , the mutated octamer sequence did not compete for binding ( lanes 13-18 ) .
These data indicate that the novel octamer binding proteins interact specifically with the octamer DNA sequence and not with other sequences on the fragment used for the bandshift experiments .
To identify the contact points of protein binding to the octamer element we performed a methylation interference analysis ( Siebenlist and Gilbert , 1980 ) .
An end-labelled octamer bandshift probe ( oligo oct*/hep~ ; Kemler et al .
1989 ) was partially methylated and used for a preparative bandshift assay with extracts from SK-N-BE and from BJA-B cells .
As seen in Figure 2 , formation of the N-Oct-2 complex ( lane 1 ) as well as the N-Oct-3 complex ( lane 2 ) was prevented by methylation over the same nucleotides of the octamer region as for the Oct-2A protein from BJA-B cells ( lane 3 ) .
We conclude therefore that the mode of DNA recognition is the same for all three octamer binding proteins tested .
« ith « ik - am < dh « « « itn dh P ] Figure 2 : Autoradiograph of a methylation interference analysis with the radiolabelled octamer bandshift probe and Oct-2A from B-cells , N-Oct-2 and N-Oct-3 proteins from SK-N-BE cells reveals identical contact sites over the octamer element .
The nucleotides the methylation of which completely or partially interferes with protein binding are indicated by solid or open triangles , respectively .
Isolation of octamer binding proteins from neuroblastoma cells Preparative SDS-PAGE of nuclear extracts and subsequent recovery and renaturation of size-separated proteins is a simple and straightforward method to isolate and compare different octamer binding proteins ( Schreiber et al.1988 ) .
Nuclear extract from SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells was loaded onto a 12 % SDS-protein gel .
The Oct-1 binding activity eluted from a region of the SDS-PAGE gel corresponding to a MW of 90-100 kDa .
This value is in accordance with published data ( Fletcher et al .
1987 ) .
The N-Oct-2 binding activity eluted from a region around 60 kDa ( +/- 5 kDa ) and the N-Oct-3 binding activity eluted from a region around 50 kDa ( +/- 5 kDa ) .
In spite of extensive efforts , we did not succeed in achieving renaturation of the N-Oct-4 and the N-Oct-5 complexes .
Figure 3A ( lanes 1-4 ) shows an autoradiograph of a bandshift experiment with renatured Oct-proteins isolated from SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells .
The specificity of the Oct-proteins DNA interactions was demonstrated by binding competition analysis with a 100-fold molar excess of an unlabelled wildtype octamer binding site ( lanes 5-7 ) and an otherwise identical DNA fragment which contained a mutated octamer binding site ( lanes 8-10 ) .
Note that the N-Oct-2 complex appeared to consist of two independent binding activities which migrated closely together when tested under native conditions ( see Figure 1 ) but were clearly separable after physical separation on a denaturing gel and subsequent renaturation .
It is conceivable that a low MW component was removed from the complex during the denaturation/separation process .
We have tentatively designated the proteins responsible for the slower migrating component and faster migrating complexes as N-Oct-Z2 « and N-Oct-2 $ , respectively .
This latter protein was also present in the gel eluate containing the N-Oct-3 protein .
Combination of both gel slice eluates yielded an additive increase in N-Oct-2 ( binding activity ; the same result was seen when both ( still unrenatured ) protein eluates were co-renatured ( data not shown ) .
We conclude , therefore , that the N-Oct-2 complex seen in the extracts of astrocytes and some neuroblastoma cell lines consists of two A { & & ® I~ ato i > me ie A oo of CEC oC o* ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 in kkkkk a wa a- ct-20 .

18 5499 separable entities with MW of ca .
60 kDa each , namely N-Oct-2 « and N-Oct-2 ( @ .
N-Oct-2 and N-Oct-3 also bind to the heptamer element of the IgH promoter A characteristic feature of known Oct-proteins is their remarkable flexibility in binding site recognition ( Sturm et al .
1988 ; Thali et al .
1988 ) .
The Oct-1 and Oct-2A/B proteins do not only bind to the octamer motif ( ATGCAAAT ) , but also to the unrelated heptamer motif CTCATGA present in the IgH gene promoter , though with lower affinity ( Poellinger and Roeder,1989 ; Kemler et al .
, 1989 ) .
We asked whether the novel Oct-proteins present in the nervous system cells are also able to bind to this heptamer sequence .
To this end , we incubated a radiolabelled oligonucleotide containing the heptamer element and a mutated octamer sequence ( hep* oct~ ; Kemler et al .
, 1989 ) with renatured fractions from size-separated octamer binding proteins derived from SK-N-BE cells .
As shown in Figure 3B , the neuroblastoma derived Oct-1 , N-Oct-2 and N-Oct-3 proteins can specifically bind to the heptamer motif ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , and thus display the same feature of heterologous sequence recognition as the Oct-proteins from B-lymphocytes .
The N-Oct-protein : heptamer-DNA interaction was efficiently competed with excess of unlabelled DNA with an octamer- binding site ( lanes 3 and 4 ) but not with a DNA fragment containing a mutated octamer sequence ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Oct-2A from B-cells is different from the N-Oct-2 complex By using the proteolytic clipping bandshift assay technique ( Marzouki et al .
1986 ) it was possible to distinguish the three major forms of octamer DNA binding proteins detected in B lymphocytes ( Schreiber et al .
1988 ) .
Since the Oct-2A protein from B-cells comigrates with the N-Oct-2 complex in a bandshift gel we asked whether the Oct-2A protein is related to the a or { -form of this complex .
To this end , the Oct-2A protein from BJA-B cells and the N-Oct-2 complex from SK-N-BE cells were isolated following SDS-PAGE , renatured , and , after a preincubation in a bandshift binding reaction , exposed to defined heptamer ___ probe no octamer mutated competitor __ competitor octamer DNA DNA competitor DNA Figure 3A : Autoradiograph of a bandshift experiment after separation of N-Oct-2 « /28 and N-Oct-3 by preparative SDS-PAGE and renaturation .
Nuclear extracts prepared from SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells were separated on a denaturing protein gel ; after cutting the gel into slices , the proteins were eluted and subjected to a denaturation/renaturation protocol as described in Materials and Methods .
The three octamer DNA binding complexes detected , which correspond to Oct-1 , N-Oct-2 « /28 and N-Oct-3 , were used for a competition experiment as described in legend to Figure 1C .
Figure 3B : N-Oct-proteins bind also to the heptamer element of the IgH promoter .
Isolated N-Oct-2 « /28 and N-Oct-3 protein ( see Figure 3A ) were tested by bandshift assay using a radiolabelled heptamer motif ( see Material and Methods ) and either intact or mutated octamer competitor DNAs as described in legend to Figure 1C .

18 amounts of trypsin which cleaves proteins after arginine or lysine residues .
As seen in Figure 4A , increasing amounts of trypsin clipped the Oct-2A protein of BJA-B cells into five polypeptides .
Even though the degradation pattern of the neuroblastoma N-Oct-2 complex differed somewhat from that of Oct-2A , note that three small truncated polypeptides ( most probably derived from N-Oct-2 « ) comigrate with peptides derived from the Oct-Z2A protein .
Although the N-Oct-2 ( 3 protein seems to be more resistant to trypsin than N-Oct-2 « its contribution to the lower molecular weight fragments is not clear .
We are therefore unable at this point to assess its contribution to the clipping pattern seen in Figure 4A and its relationship to N-Oct-2 « .
We conclude that both N-Oct 2 proteins are distinct from the Oct-2A protein of B-cells .
We next used the ArgC protease , which cleaves proteins specifically after arginine residues , to analyze the relationship between Oct-2A from B-cells and the N-Oct-3 protein from Bowes melanocytes .
Figure 4B shows that the clipping pattern exhibited by N-Oct-3 was seemingly similar to that of Oct-2A .
The change in the molecular weights of the two different polypeptides due to the action of ArgC is the same , even though the starting molecular weights are dissimilar .
This observation can be interpreted to mean that both proteins contain a homologous domain that is removed upon ArgC digestion .
However , the Oct-2A protein appeared to be more sensitive towards ArgC proteolysis than the N-Oct-3 protein .
A similar lower sensitivity to ArgC proteolysis was observed for the N-Oct-3 protein in SK-N-BE extracts ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , the extent of the relation between these proteins remains an open question .
The Oct-1 complex from extracts of Bowes ( Figure 4B ) and SK-N-BE cells ( data not shown ) is considered to be identical with the ubiquitous Oct-1 protein since it displayed the same degradation pattern as that described for the Oct-1 protein of HeLa and BJA-B cells ( Schreiber et al .
1988 ) .
Antibodies directed against Oct-1 or Oct-2A do not recognize N-Oct proteins To further investigate the relationship of N-Oct-factors to Oct-1 and Oct-2 , we used antisera raised against recombinant Oct-1 or Oct-2 proteins .
Nuclear proteins from BJA-B .
lymphocytes , Bowes melanoma cells , and from astrocytes were preincubated A l_ i < -¢ .
HH HHH with dilutions of either antiserum and then tested for octamer-DNA sequence binding .
From Figure 5A it is evident that the anti-Oct-l-antibodies specifically affected DNA-binding of the Oct-1 protein .
Neither the B-cell type factors Oct-2A and Oct-2B nor the N-Oct factors were neutralized .
The preimmune serum did not affect any of the Oct-proteins ( data not shown ) .
Next , we used the anti-Oct-2-antibodies : Figure 5B shows that all N-Oct factors and Oct-1 remained unaffected in DNA-binding and migration even at high antiserum concentrations , whereas virtually all DNA binding activity of Oct-2A and ( less pronounced ) of Oct-2B proteins were affected .
The interactions of the antibodies with Oct-2 gave rise to high molecular weight complexes and at higher concentrations of the antiserum to elimination of DNA binding .
We conclude that all N-Oct proteins do not contain epitopes which can be recognized by the two polyclonal antisera directed against the Oct-1 and the Oct-2 proteins respectively .
Therefore , the N-Oct proteins are most likely structurally different from Oct-1 and Oct-2 .
Transcription from a B cell-specific promoter is not stimulated in N-Oct-3 containing Bowes melanocytes The octamer sequence in conjunction with a TATA box constitutes a B-cell specific promoter ( Dreyfus et al .
1987 , Wirth et al .
1987 , Miiller et al .
1988 ) .
A simple model proposes that the transcription activation potential of the lymphoid-specific Oct-2A protein is sufficient to activate this promoter , whereas the ubiquitous Oct-1 protein is only able to activate transcription in conjunction with an additional , closely bound transcription factor ( reviewed in Schaffner,1989 ) .
We asked whether the N-Oct-3 protein in Bowes melanocytes is able to 'transactivate ' such a minimal , B-cell specific promoter .
Bowes melanocytes ( containing Oct-1 and N-Oct-3 ) and Cos7 kidney fibroblasts ( containing only Oct-1 ) were transfected with the target plasmids outlined in Figure 6 .
Construct A contains the octamer sequence separated from the TATA box of the B-globin reporter gene by 5 bp .
Construct B , which contains a mutated octamer sequence , and construct C , which contains the wild-type 3-globin promoter , were used as negative and positive controls , respectively .
After transient expression of these constructs , the cytoplasmic RNA was isolated and reporter B Us us C # as « - @ pres « * IP « » « -- up C oud Figure 4A : Autoradiograph of a proteolytic clipping bandshift analysis .
The SDS-PAGE purified Oct-2A protein from B-cells and N-Oct-2 « and 8 from SK-N-BE cells were pre-incubated with the radiolabelled bandshift probe and subjected to limited proteolysis by addition of the indicated amount of trypsin .
After 10 min .
the 'bandshift'/protease mixture was loaded on a bandshift gel .
The clipping pattern is illustrated schematically on the right hand side .
The faster migrating band seen with N-Oct-2 in the absence of trypsin is a degradation product of N-Oct-2 .

transcripts monitored by RNase protection mapping .
Figure 6 shows that the B cell-specific octamer-TATA promoter ( construct A ) remained silent in Bowes melanocytes as well as in Cos7 cells .
To exclude a possible repressor function of N-Oct 3 perhaps analogous to the one proposed for NF-A III ( Lenardo et al .
1989 ) , we co-transfected construct A and the Oct-2A cDNA in an expression vector ( Miiller et al .
1988b ) .
This resulted in an activation of this promoter comparable to the strong activation seen with the promoter ( construct C ; data not shown ) .
This result indicates that the N-Oct-3 protein , in the amounts present in Bowes melanoma cells , is neither competent to 'transactivate ' a simple octamer-TATA promoter nor to prevent promoter activation by the Oct-2A protein .
DISCUSSION The present work shows that the nervous system expresses a set of Oct-proteins which is distinct from that expressed by the immune system .
The nervous system derived octamer binding proteins have been designated as Oct-1 ( the ubiquitous species ) , N-Oct-2a « and 28 , N-Oct-3 , N-Oct-4 and N-Oct-5a/5b on the basis of their mobility in the bandshift assay .
While this work was in progress , Scholer et al .
( 1989 ) published an overview of octamer binding proteins from extracts of various tissues including brain of mouse and rat .

18 5501 the bandshift assay ; in their nomenclature the Oct-2 band corresponds to our N-Oct-2 complex , Oct-3 to N-Oct-3 , Oct-7 to N-Oct-4 and Oct9/10 to N-Oct Sa/b .
In this report we describe the differential distribution of these proteins in both astrocytes and tumor cell lines of the nervous system .
Further , we have studied the DNA binding characteristics of the N-Oct-2 and N-Oct-3 proteins and analyzed their relationship to the Oct-proteins from the immune system .
Finally , we tested the role of N-Oct-3 as a putative transcription factor .
B-cell and nervous system derived Oct-proteins have indistinguishable features of DNA-binding The nuclear proteins from nervous system cells share the same properties of specific binding to the octamer motif as the ubiquitous Oct-1 protein and the lymphoid-prominent Oct-2A and Oct-2B proteins by several criteria .
The binding of the N-Oct proteins to the octamer motif was competed efficiently by an excess of unlabelled octamer binding site , but was not affected when the binding site was mutated .
The DNA binding domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2A share a 60 amino acid region referred to as the homeodomain , first described in factors regulating early development in Drosophila , and by the adjacent region , designated the POU-specific domain .
The POU-domain is highly conserved among the transcriptional activators Pit-1 , a factor essential for prolactin and growth B-cell Melanoma Astrocytes wane sone was Nit lg ” -- 0-woe wr man tth wae » - .

18 hormone gene expression in pituitary cells ( Ingraham et al .
1988 ) , Oct-1 and Oct-2 and the Caenorhabditis gene unc-86 ( reviewed in Herr et al .
1988 and Garcia-Blanco et al .
1989 ) .
The methylation interference pattern generated on the octamer sequence is identical for N-Oct-2 proteins , N-Oct-3 , and Oct-2A .
Furthermore , like the known Oct-1 , Oct-2A , and Oct-2B proteins ( Kemler et al .
1989 ) , the N-Oct-3 protein and the N-Oct-2 proteins recognize also the heptamer element CTCATGA of the IgH promoter .
We therefore suspect the DNA binding domains of N-Oct-2 « and ( 3 and N-Oct-3 contain homologies with the POU-homeo DNA binding domain of known Oct-proteins .
In order to isolate additional members of the POU-domain containing family of transcription factors , oligonucleotide primers that comprised the conserved nucleotide residues of the four POU domains were used to amplify cDNAs from rat brain mRNA by the polymerase chain reaction ( He et al .
1989 ) .
Three amplification products , referred to as ( brain ) Brn-1 , Brn-2 , and Brn-3 , were shown to be highly homologous , but not identical , to known POU-domains .
Furthermore , the amplification products were shown to differentially hybridize in situ to certain segments and regions of the brain ( He et al .
1989 ) .
It is possible that at least some of these amplified transcripts correspond to the novel octamer binding proteins described in this study .
Recently , Monuki et al .
( 1989 ) and He et al .
( 1989 ) isolated cDNAs encoding a POU-domain containing factor , termed SCIP ( or tst-1 respectively ) , that is present in myelin-forming glia cells but absent in astrocytes .
The expression of this factor is cAMP inducible and thought to be involved as a primary step in the cascade of progressive determination of myelination .
Although all sequenced genes of genuine octamer DNA-binding proteins contain POU-domains , the reverse may not be true ; the actual DNA binding sites for the brn 1-3 factors and the SCIP ( tst-1 ) protein remain to be determined .
Since the SCIP factor is absent in astrocytes , we think that it was not detected in our experiments .
Differential distribution of N-Oct proteins in glial and neuronal cells Substantial differences were observed in the expression pattern of the N-Oct proteins in different human glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines .
Both cell types displayed the N-Oct-2 complex together with the N-Oct-3 protein or the N-Oct-3 protein alone .
Therefore , these data did not make it possible to distinguish the cell lines according to their origin as glial or neuronal .
Remarkably , LN-18 and 308 glioblastoma cells contained only the Oct-1 protein .
Whether this result represents a cell line pecularity remains unclear .
We have now analyzed 20 more neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines derived from human tumors ; all of these displayed either N-Oct-3 alone or N-Oct-3 together with the N-Oct-2 complex ( our unpublished results ) .
We have yet to find a cell line displaying the N-Oct-2 complex in the absence of the N-Oct-3 protein .
Astrocytes can be classified as epitheloid type 1 and stellar type-2 .
These two populations belong to two different cell lineages ; bipotential glial precursors differentiate into type-2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes while type 1 astrocytes belong to a different lineage ( Raff et al .
1983 ) .
Under the culture conditions used in the present experiments , more than 90 % of the astrocytes express the Ran-2 antigen , a marker for type-1 astrocytes ( Massa et al .
1987 ) .
It is striking that fully differentiated type-1 astrocytes in culture express all of the N-Oct proteins detectable under our assay conditions .
The relationship of N-Oct proteins with Oct-2 from B-cells The N-Oct-2 complex , the N-Oct-3 protein , and the Oct-2A protein from BJA-B cells were compared by proteolytic clipping bandshift analysis in order to assess structural similarities and differences .
In the case of N-Oct-2 , advanced proteolytic cleavage results in the production of polypeptides which comigrate with polypeptides produced by similar cleavage of Oct-2A .
This might indicate a conserved homology in the DNA binding region between these proteins .
A similar phenomenon was observed when the clipping patterns of Oct-2A , -2B and Oct-l were compared ( Schreiber et al .
1988 ) , namely the use of high protease concentrations resulted in the appearance of similarly migrating polypeptides .
These results were interpreted to reflect the high degree of homology in the DNA binding domain in these proteins .
This prediction was subsequently confirmed by the cloning of the cDNAs encoding Oct-1 and Oct-2 ( Herr et al .
1988 ) .
The clipping patterns of N-Oct-2 « and ( 3 using trypsin digestion were found to be different , suggesting that N-Oct-2 « and N-Oct-28 are distinct proteins .
These data in addition to the immunological data lead us to conclude that the N-Oct-2 a and { proteins are not identical to the Oct-2A protein from B-cells .
When the protease ArgC was used to analyze the relationship between Oct-2A and N-Oct 3 , we saw a similar change in molecular weight upon proteolytic cleavage which could reflect a structural relationship in certain domains between Oct-2A and N-Oct-3 .
However , the N-Oct-3 protein , the N-Oct-2 « /B complex , and all other N-Oct factors were not at all recognized by specific antisera directed against recombinant Oct-1 or Oct-2A protein .
Therefore , we consider it most likely that the N-Oct factor genes are different from the oct-1 or oct-2 genes .
This finding contrasts with a report indicating Oct-2 to be present also in nervous system cells ( Scholer et al .
, 1989 ) .
Additionally , Staudt et al .
( 1988 ) showed that a human glioblastoma cell lines expressed the Oct-2 mRNA when tested by Northern blot using an Oct-2 cDNA probe .
Furthermore , in situ hybridization with an RNA probe containing the entire POU-domain revealed expression of Oct-2 mRNA in rat brain tissue ( He et al .
1989 ) .
Since we have clearly shown that the Oct-2A protein from B-cells is absent from astrocytes and from cell lines established from tumors of the nervous system , we believe that the RNA hybridization results which imply oct-2 expression in the brain can be explained by extensive sequence homologies between the Oct-2 gene and N-Oct-factor gene ( s ) .
Sequence homologies are most likely to occur in the POU-homeo DNA-binding region .
Alternatively , if the oct-2 gene is expressed in the brain in the absence of detectable quantities of Oct-2 protein , one must consider a mechanism that blocks translation of oct-2 transcripts or prevents DNA-binding of the protein e.g .
by an inhibiting factor .
A lymphoid-specific promoter is neither stimulated nor repressed in N-Oct-3 containing cells The octamer motif present in the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain promoters and in the heavy chain enhancer plays an important role as a determinant of B cell specificity ( reviewed in Schreiber et al .
1989 ) .
However , the octamer motif is not only restricted to immunoglobulin promoters ; in addition to some housekeeping genes , it is also present in promoters of specifically expressed genes such as the ones coding for MHC class II protein ( Sherman et al .
1989 ) , the interleukin 1 , and the granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( J. Blaszczynski , personal communication ) .
The transcription of these genes is inducible in astrocytes ( Fontana et al .
1982 and 1984 ; Malipiero et al .
1989 ) and thus N-Oct factors may be involved in their regulation .
It is also conceivable that target promoters/enhancers of N-Oct factors contain the heptamer site CTCATGA , since we have shown that N-Oct proteins can specifically bind to this sequence .
Another candidate for activation by N-Oct factors is the human calcitonin/ « -CGRP gene .
This gene is expressed in neural and thyroid tissues and contains an octamer site at position -160 ( Broad et al .
, 1989 ) .
It is also conceivable that N-Oct factors serve to downregulate certain genes .
This hypothesis gained support by a recent report of Kemp et al .
( 1990 ) .
These authors could show that the octamer motif mediates transcriptional repression of Herpes simplex virus immediate early genes in C1300 neuroblastoma cells .
To investigate the specificity of N-Oct-3 factor , we have assayed for activation and repression of a reporter gene that contains an octamer-TATA promoter , which is readily activated in HeLa cells by ectopic overexpression of Oct-2A protein but not by the endogenous Oct-1 protein ( Miller et al .
1988b ) .
This promoter construct was not activated after transfection into Bowes melanoma cells , which express both Oct-1 and N-Oct-3 protein .
A trivial explanation for this observation could be a low N-Oct-3 factor concentration ; ectopic overexpression of the N-Oct-3 cDNA , which is yet to be cloned , may clarify this issue .
Co-transfection of the Oct-2A cDNA , however , gave strong activation of the reporter gene in Bowes cells , similar to the earlier findings with HeLa cells ( Miller et al .
, 1988b ) .
At least under our assay conditions , N-Oct-3 protein did not interfere with the activation of the lymphoid specific promoter upon co-expression with Oct-2A protein .
We consider it likely that N-Oct-3 is a transcriptional activator for genes specifically expressed in cells of the nervous system and related cell types .
