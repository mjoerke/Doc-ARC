Characterization of a CD43/Leukosialin-mediated Pathway for Inducing Apoptosis in Human T-Lymphoblastoid Cells* ( Received for publication , February 8 , 1996 , and in revised form , August 16 , 1996 ) T. Joseph Brown , Walt W. Shuford , Wei-Chun Wang , Steven G. Nadler , Tina S. Bailey , Hans Marquardt , and Robert S. Mittlert From the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute , Seattle , Washington 98121 The monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) J393 induces apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells .
NH-terminal amino acid sequence analysis identified the 140-kDa surface antigen for mAb J393 as CD43/leukosialin , the major sialoglycoprotein of leukocytes .
While Jurkat cells co-expressed two discrete cell-surface isoforms of CD43 , recognized by mAb J393 and mAb G10-2 , respectively , only J398/CD48 signaled apoptosis .
J393/CD43 was found to be hyposialylated , bearing predominantly O-linked monosaccharide gly-cans , whereas G10-2/CD43 bore complex sialylated tetra-and hexasaccharide chains .
Treatment with soluble , bivalent mAb J393 killed 25-50 % of the cell population , while concomitant engagement of either the CD3-TcR complex or the integrins CD18 and CD29 significantly potentiated this effect .
Treatment of Jurkat cells with mAb J393 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of specific protein substrates that underwent hyperphosphorylation upon antigen receptor costimulation .
Tyrosine kinase inhibition by herbimycin A diminished J393/CD43-mediated apoptosis , whereas inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity by bis ( maltolato ) oxovanadium-IV enhanced cell death .
Signal transduction through tyrosine kinase activation may lead to altered gene expression , as J393/CD43 ligation prompted decreases in the nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulatory protein NF- « B and proteins binding the interferon-inducible regulatory element .
Since peripheral blood T-lymphocytes express cryptic epitopes for mAb J393 , these findings demonstrate the existence of a tightly regulated CD43-mediated pathway for inducing apoptosis in human T-cell lineages .
In T-lymphocytes CD43/leukosialin , the major sialoglycoprotein of leukocytes ( 1 , 2 ) , is thought to serve a dual role in regulating cellular immune responses .
Due to the repulsive effect of its high numbers of O-linked negatively charged sialic acid sugar residues , CD43 acts as a `` barrier molecule `` by limiting cell-cell/cell-ligand interactions ( 3-7 ) , a property that may negatively regulate T-cell activation ( 8 ) .
In addition , engagement of CD43 by monoclonal antibodies has been shown to induce costimulatory activity in T-cells by a mechanism analogous to a classic ligand-receptor interaction ( 9-11 ) .
Alterations in O-glycan structure and function of CD43 reportedly occur in the immunodeficiency disorders Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( 12 , 13 ) and AIDS ( 14 , 15 ) as well as in graft versus host disease ( 16 ) , acute lymphocytic leukemia ( 17 ) , and permanent * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

The molecular structure of human CD43 is mucin-like , consisting of an extended rod-shaped extracellular portion bearing approximately 80 sialylated O-glycan sites and a single N-glycan site , a highly conserved transmembrane region , and a long cytoplasmic domain bearing potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites ( 19 ) .
Based on the exon/intron arrangement within its gene , the observed molecular heterogeneity of CD43 in both mice and man is thought to reflect differential post-translational modifications of a single gene product ( 20-22 ) .
Linear protein epitopes in the native structure of CD43 have been shown to be modified by glycosylation ( 23 ) , allowing for the development of isoform-specific antibodies ( 9 , 11 , 24 ) .
Following T-cell activation , the O-linked oligosaccharides of CD43 change from tetrasaccharides ( mAb'* G10-2 reactive ) to more complex hexasaccharides ( mAb T-305 reactive ) due to the activation-induced expression of core 2 B1-6 N-acetylglu-cosaminyltransferase ( 17 , 25 ) .
This change in oligosaccharide structure results in a shift from 115 to 140 kDa ( 9 , 17 , 25 , 26 ) .
There is little information correlating heterogeneity in oligosaccharide structure with ligand specificity or the signal trans-ducing properties of CD43 .
In the thymus , thymocyte-thymic epithelial cell interactions correlate with the preferential binding of galectin-1 to the mAb T-305/CD43 isoform expressed in immature , cortical thymocytes ( 27 ) .
In mature T-cells the binding of anti-CD43 antibodies , thought to mimic natural ligands , results in CD28-independent costimulatory activity ( 11 , 28-31 ) .
Interestingly , the L10 antibody directed against a neuraminidase-resistant epitope of CD43 is a strong inducer of T-cell proliferation , whereas the B1B6 antibody directed against a neuraminidase-sensitive epitope is only weakly mitogenic ( 10 ) .
Immunoprecipitations from T-lymphoblastoid cell lysates have found CD43 to be associated with CD3/TcR and p56* protein tyrosine kinase ( 11 ) , providing both physical and functional evidence for a role for CD43 in signal transduction .
The anti-CD43 antibody , mAb MEM-59 , which is costimulatory in T-lymphocytes has recently been reported to induce programmed cell death or apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitor cells ( 32 ) .
Clearly , CD43-mediated responses can differ significantly depending on the cell type and the isoform being expressed .
While aberrant isoforms of CD43 have been associated with immuno-deficiencies resulting in lymphopenia ( 33 , 34 ) , there has been no direct evidence linking CD43-mediated apoptosis with T-cell depletion .

27686 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Induction of Apoptosis in T-cells by Anti-CD43 mAb Here we report the biochemical and functional characterization of an anti-CD43 mAb designated J393 that recognizes a unique , alternatively glycosylated isoform of CD43 expressed on the surface of the human T-lymphoblastoid cell line , Jurkat .
Treatment of Jurkat cells with mAb J393 induces apoptosis in a CD43 isoform-specific manner .
The level of apoptosis may be enhanced by concomitant engagement of the TcR or integrin molecules .
Moreover , an isoform of CD43 is detected in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes bearing a cryptic epitope for mAb J393 .
These results describe a potentially novel mechanism for T-cell lineage depletion involving the regulated expression of specific isoforms of CD43 .

Cytofluorometric Analysis of CD43 Expression and CD43-induced Apoptosis-Both the level of cell-surface expression of CD43 and the level of apoptosis ( cell death ) were determined by flow cytometry ( FACS ) using a FACStar fluorescence activated cell sorter ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) controlled by the Cicero automated data acquisition and analysis system ( Cytomation , Fort Collins , CO ) .
Data were collected for 1 X 104 cells .
Cells were phenotyped by indirect immunofluorescence as described previously ( 86 ) .
Apoptosis within a culture was determined by incubating cell samples with 10 ug/ml propidium iodide ( PTI ) for 10 min at room temperature prior to analysis .
Dead cells exhibiting size reduction and PI fluorescence were electronically gated into quadrants 1-8 and counted as a percentage of the total cell population .

Samples were analyzed by forward light scatter versus fluorescence to generate a histogram representing the size and relative amount of fragmented DNA .
Purification of the mAb J393 Antigen-The antigen for mAb J898 was purified by affinity chromatography from detergent lysates of a high-expresser subclone of the Jurkat cell line , BMS-2 .
The affinity column was prepared by covalently attaching purified mAb J398 to GammaBind Plus protein G-Sepharose ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc. ) using maleimide as the cross-linking reagent .
Non-covalently attached antibody was removed by alternating rinses in pH 4.0 and pH 9.0 Tris buffers .
BMS-2 cell pellets were solubilized at 4 °C in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer ( 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 140 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris , 10 mM EDTA ) containing protease inhibitors ( PMSF , leupeptin , soybean trypsin inhibitor , pepstatin , and antipain ) and the protein concentration adjusted to 2 mg/ml .

The antigen preparation was dialyzed/ concentrated by filtration using 10 mM Tris buffer , pH 8.0 , containing 0.1 % deoxycholate prior to amino acid sequence analysis .
Protein Sequencing-The affinity-purified antigen for mAb J898 was prepared for protein sequencing by subjecting the sample to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a SDS-Tricine buffer system ( Bio-Rad ) on a minigel apparatus ( 80 X 80 X 0.5 mm ) with a 10 % acrylamide resolving gel and a 4 % acrylamide stacking layer run under reducing conditions .
The separated proteins were then electroblotted ( 87 ) onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Immobilon-P , Millipore Corp. , Bedford , MA ) , and the location of the mAb J898 antigen was confirmed by Western blotting .
The Coomassie Brilliant Blue stainable band of protein corresponding to the 140-kDa mAb J898 antigen was subjected to NH , -terminal amino acid sequence analysis ( 38 ) .
Automated sequence analysis was performed in a pulsed-liquid protein sequencer ( model 476A , Applied Biosystems , Inc. ) using manufacturer-released cycle programs as described previously ( 89 ) .

Cells were then harvested and washed twice with PBS before disruption in ice-cold lysis buffer ( PBS containing 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mM PMSF , and 1 mg/ml each of leupep-tin and aprotinin ) .
The lysates were clarified by high speed centrifugation and the supernatants collected .
Radiolabeled CD43 was immunoprecipitated from these supernatants with 10 ug/ml anti-CD43 mAb and the resulting immune-complex recovered by binding to protein A-Sepharose .
O-Linked oligosaccharides were released from the immunoprecipitates by B-elimination as described previously ( 41 ) , desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column , dried , taken up in water , and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography on a column ( 0.4 X 30 cm ) of amino-bonded silica ( AX-10 , Varian ) .
The mobile phase contained a mixture of 15 mM KH , PO , , pH 4.5 , and acetonitrile .
One-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over a linear gradient of decreasing acetonitrile concentration ( 80-50 % ) , and aliquots were sampled for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting .
CD48 oligosaccharides were obtained from HL6O and K562 cells as described previously ( 42 ) and used as standards .
Immunoaffinity Chromatography of CD43 Glycopeptides-Radiola-beled CD43 was prepared from immunoprecipitates of [ *Hlglu-cosamine-labeled T-lymphoblastoid cells as described above .
Glycopeptides were generated by digestion of labeled mAb J398 antigen with 5 mg/ml nonspecific protease ( Pronase ) in 0.1 M Tris-HC ] l buffer containing 1 mM CaC ) , , pH 8.0 , for 24 h at 60 °C under a toluene atmosphere .
The digestion was terminated by boiling for 10 min .
Epitope integrity of glycopeptides was evaluated by immunoaffinity chromatography .
Glycopeptides were suspended in 50 ul of TBS buffer ( 50 mm Tris-HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl , , pH 7.5 ) and applied to a l-ml mAb J898-Sepharose column ( 0.3 X 14 em ) coupled with 6.3 mg of antibody and equilibrated in TBS buffer at 4°C .
Glycopeptides have been shown to optimally interact with carbohydrate binding proteins coupled to Sepharose at this protein density and in the cold ( 48 ) .
Fractions of 1 ml were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/h with all steps being carried out at 4°C .

Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay-Nuclear extracts were prepared from approximately 1 X 10 `` cells using a modification of the procedure of Dignam et al .
( 45 ) .
Briefly , cells were lysed for 5 min at 4 °C in 10 mM Hepes , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 10 mM NaCl , 0.25 % Nonidet P-40 , pH 7.5 , followed by centrifugation and salt extraction of nuclei in 20 mM Hepes , 25 % glycerol , 0.42 M NaCl , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.25 % Nonidet P-40 , pH 7.5 , for 30 min at 4°C .
The nuclear extract was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min , and the supernatants were used for the electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay .
The electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay was essentially performed according to the procedure of Sen and Baltimore ( 46 ) .

Finally , the cells were washed and resuspended in culture medium prior to analysis using the Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope .
RESULTS mAb J393-induced Apoptosis in Cultured T-lymphoblastoid Cells-Mice immunized with the human T-lymphoblastoid cell line , Jurkat , produced an antibody termed J393 that induced homotypic adhesion and then death of these cells in culture .
Within the first hour of treatment Jurkat cells underwent pronounced homotypic adhesion , forming large cellular aggre-gates .
Over a period of 4-6 h a certain proportion of the cell population began to die .
Under the phase contrast microscope , morphologic changes were observed that were characteristic of the type of programmed cell death referred to as apoptosis ( membrane blebbing , cellular shrinkage , and nuclear conden-sation ) .
As an indicator of death , cells were monitored for the uptake of the fluorescent compound propidium iodide ( PT ) .
Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry as a function of size versus fluorescence intensity to determine the level of killing and the degree of nuclear damage .
By comparison of Fig .
1A with Fig .
1B , the percent of dead or dying cells detected by PI permeability ( quadrants 2 and 3 ) or decrease in forward light scatter ( quadrants 1 and 2 ) increased from 1.9 to 52.9 % as a result of mAb J393 treatment ( sum of quadrants 1 , 2 , and 3 ) , whereas the number of Pl-impermeable cells or viable cells decreased accordingly ( quadrant 4 ) .
It should be noted that quadrants 1 and 2 represent a population of cells with decreased forward light scattering properties , reflecting a decrease in cell size ( shrinkage ) .
The level of killing of Jurkat cells by mAb J393 was both concentration- and time-depend-ent , reaching a maximum of 25-50 % dead after a 24-h treatment with 5 ug/ml of antibody ( data not shown ) .

Apoptosis in T-lymphoblastoid cells is induced by mAb J898 .
Actively growing Jurkat cells ( 1 X 10°/ml ) were treated for 24 h ( A ) without or ( B ) with 5 ug/ml mAb J8938 followed by cytofluorimetric analysis of propidium iodide ( Pl ) uptake as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
The percent of total population falling within each quadrant is given .
A decrease in cells within quadrant 4 indicates an increase in cell death .
C , cells treated with ( Ratched ) or without ( solid ) 5 ug/ml mAb J898 for 24 h were exposed to Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing PI , and the nuclei were cytofluorimetrically analyzed as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
Fluorescence intensity below that of intact G/G , chromatin indicates the presence of hypodiploid cells in the original cell population .
Apoptosis may be associated with the breakdown of DNA as a result of increased endonuclease activity .
To further assess whether cell death induced by mAb J393 was characteristic of apoptosis , PI was allowed to intercalate with the DNA in Jurkat cell lysates and the nuclear staining analyzed cytofluorimetrically ( Fig .
1C ) .
Treatment with mAb J393 resulted in an increase in the population of hypodiploid cells as measured by a 3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity below that of intact G , /G , chromatin ( 26 % of the total DNA in treated cultures versus 8 % in the untreated population ) .
Since apoptosis has been regarded as fundamentally important to homeostasis of the immune system , it was of interest to identify the antigen for mAb J8398 .
NH -terminal Protein Sequence of the mAb J393 Antigen-The antigen for mAb J393 was isolated from detergent lysates of Jurkat cells by affinity chromatography and purified as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
The 140-kDa protein was then examined for its primary structure .
nal amino acid sequence analysis of the mAb J393 antigen resulted in 13 of the first 15 NH , -terminal amino acid positions to be assigned ( STTAVQTPT ( X ) GE ( X ) LV ) .
This sequence was searched in the Swiss-Prot data base for homology to known proteins .
Excluding the two unassigned positions , the protein sequence obtained for the mAb J393 antigen was 100 % homol-ogous to the NH , -terminal region of human CD43/leukosialin ( 19 , 20 ) .
Since no intron structures exist in the coding region of the human CD43 gene allowing for alternative splicing of exons ( 21 ) , we take this partial sequence information to be adequate in identifying the mAb J893 antigen as CD43 .
Isoform Specificity of mAb J393-Since several antibodies to CD43 have been previously described , we questioned whether they were functionally similar to mAb J8983 .
Cultures of Jurkat cells were treated with soluble forms of the anti-CD43 mAbs G10-2 , G19-1 , and J393 and monitored for apoptosis as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``

T-lymphoblastoid cells co-express antigenically distinct isoforms of CD43 .
Actively growing Jurkat cells were immunostained with phycoerythrin-labeled mAb J898 ( red ) and FITC-conjugated mAb G19-1 ( green ) and analyzed for two-color fluorescence ( red / green ) by confocal microscopy as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
Both red and green fluorescence appear to be differentially distributed at the cell surface .
Yellow fluorescence depicts regions of colocalization .
CD43 antibodies induced observable homotypic adhesion , only mAb J393 induced apoptosis ( data not shown ) .
We observed that cells not killed by mAb J398 were growth-arrested , whereas cells treated with mAb G10-2 or mAbG19-1 continued to divide .
Jurkat cells were double-stained with the fluorescent conjugates PE-J393 and FITC-G19-1 and examined using confocal microscopy .
In Fig .
2 , the two-color staining pattern that was observed revealed that the epitopes reactive with these two antibodies resided on distinct molecules that segregated independently in the plane of the membrane .
This indicated that single cells in the population were co-expressing two distinct alternatively glycosylated isoforms of CD43 ; however , only the J393/CD43 isoform was involved in signaling an apoptotic response .
Therefore , we looked for structural differences between .
these isoforms .
Carbohydrate Analysis of the J393/CD43 Isoform-Diver-sity among human CD43 molecules has been ascribed to post-translational modifications of a single gene product ( 20-22 ) .
Therefore , we examined the carbohydrate structure of the mAb J393 antigen in comparison with that of other mAb-specific isoforms of CD43 .
Analysis was limited to O-linked sugars since CD43 is known to contain only one potential N-linked glycosylation site and 80 potential O-linked sites ( 19 ) .
Different isoforms of CD43 were immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates of T-lymphoblastoid cells using mAb J393 , mAb T-305 , and mAb G10-2 , and the attached radiolabeled carbohydrate 27689 TABLE I Structures and relative amounts of the O-linked oligosaccharides found on CD43 CD43 was immunoprecipitated from [ °H ] glucosamine-labeled T-cells .
The radioactive O-linked chains obtained after alkaline borohydride treatment of CD43 were separated by high performance liquid chromatography .

was analyzed according to `` Experimental Procedures . ``
As shown in Table I , 82 % of the total serine/threonine-linked carbohydrate of the J393/CD43 isoform in Jurkat cells were of the GaINAc monosaccharide class and 12 % were of the GalB1-3GaINAc disaccharide class .
The remaining 6 % of the O-linked sugars of the J393/CD43 molecule contained sialic acid and were of the NeuNAco2-3GalB1-3GaINAc trisaccharide class .
By comparison , 80 % of the O-linked sugars attached to the G10-2/CD43 isoform in HPB-ALL cells were made up of sialylated tri- , tetra- , and hexasaccharides with the remaining 20 % being predominantly monosaccharides .
The T-305/CD43 isoform in HPB-ALL cells displayed an oligosaccharide structure similar to that of the G10-2/CD43 isoform ; however , it contained less tetrasaccharide and more hexasaccharide moieties consistent with previous reports ( 17 ) .
Neuraminidase-resistant Property of the mAb J393 Epitope-Antibodies for CD43 have been characterized as to their epitope requirement for terminal sialic acid sugar residues .
The anti-CD43 mAb T-305 has been described as being sialic acid-independent , since the epitope is resistant to digestion by neuraminidase ( 9 ) , while the immunoreactivities of several other anti-CD43 antibodies have been shown to be sensitive to neuraminidase treatment ( 10 , 11 ) .
The histograms presented in Fig .
3 were generated by immunostaining Jurkat and HPB-ALL cells with mAb G10-2 or mAb J393 before and after V. cholerae neuraminidase treatment .
The mAb G10-2 demonstrated an absolute requirement for sialic acid residues in maintaining immunoreactivity as shown in Fig .

Mean channel fluorescence decreased from a value of 245 to a value of 11 as a result of neuraminidase treatment .
By contrast , the presence of sialic acid was not required for antigen recognition by mAb J393 ( Fig .
3 , B and C ) .
Indeed , the immunoreactivity of mAb J393 increased following neuraminidase treatment , which was most notable in HPB-ALL cells .
Enzymatic digestion by neuraminidases from either C. perfringens or A. ure-afaciens sources gave similar results ( data not shown ) .
Protease-sensitive Property of the mAb J393 Epitope-Jurkat cells are known to possess a deficiency in B1,3-galactosyltransferase activity ( 49 ) resulting in the expression of an alternatively glycosylated isoform of CD43 bearing the GaINAc-Ser/ Thr cluster structure of Tn antigen ( 50 ) .
The carbohydrate analysis of the mAb J393 antigen indicated structural similarity with this Tn antigen-containing isoform of CD43 ; however , 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 27690 Cell Number 10 o 1000 Fluorescence Intensity Fic .

The CD43-specific epitope for mAb J3938 is resistant to digestion by sialidase .
Cells ( 1 X 10° ) from the T-cell lines , Jurkat and HPB-ALL , were immunostained with anti-CD43 antibodies following treatment for 60 min at 37°C in culture medium with ( -- - ) and without ( - ) 0.05 units/ml Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
Changes in fluorescence intensity as compared with isotype-matched control antibodies ( *** ) were detected by flow cytometry .

B , HPB-ALL cells immunostained with mAb J898 .
C , Jurkat cells immunostained with mAb J898 .
we were unable to demonstrate immunostaining by mAb J893 of Tn antigen-positive CEM cells and certain Tn-expressing human carcinoma cell lines ( data not presented ) .
This result suggested that the epitope for mAb J393 differed from that described for other T ' n antibodies .
In order to characterize the nature of the epitopic structure recognized by mAb J393 , [ ' H ] glucosamine-labeled J393 antigen was proteolytically digested into glycopeptides and tested for reactivity on a mAb J393-Sepharose affinity column under conditions that promote the retention of glycopeptides ( see `` Experimental Procedures `` ) .
Many anti-carbohydrate antibodies bind to carbohydrate antigens under these experimental conditions ( 51 , 52 ) .
As demonstrated in Fig .
4 , 87 % of the radioactivity associated with intact CD43 required elution at acidic pH , indicating a strong anti-gen-antibody interaction with the column substrate .
By contrast , 93 % of the radioactivity associated with CD43 glycopeptides eluted at neutral pH , indicating very weak interaction with the column substrate and loss of antigenic valency .
A minor proportion ( 7 % ) of CD43 digest that eluted under acid conditions may represent larger glycoprotein fragments resulting from incomplete proteolysis .
Intact [ °H ] glucosamine-labeled mAb G10-2 antigen isolated from the HPB-ALL cell line failed to interact with the mAb J393 affinity substrate , demonstrating the specificity for antigen ( data not presented ) .
These results suggest that specific protein and carbohydrate domains of CD43 are important for high-avidity recognition of epitope by mAb J8983 .
Cell-surface Interactions That Enhance J393/CD43-Mediated Apoptosis-It has previously been shown that certain isoforms of CD43 can function as accessory molecules in CD3/TcR-stimulated T-cell activation ( 11 , 28-31 ) and may also be involved in cell-cell interactions by binding to the integrin family adhesion molecule ICAM-1 ( 4 ) .
Therefore , we investigated the effect of ligating additional surface molecules on the ability of mAb J393 to induce apoptosis .

Glycopeptides generated by proteolysis eluted from the mAb J898-Sepharose immunoaffinity column at pH 7.5 , predominantly in fractions 1-5 and prior to applying an isocratic shift to pH 8.0 .
Under identical conditions , undigested antigen was retained at neutral pH and eluted in fractions 5-10 following the isocratic shift to pH 8.0 .

Apoptosis induced by mAb J393 is potentiated by concomitant ligation of CD3/TcR and the integrins .
Actively growing Jurkat cells were treated for 24 h with 5 ug/ml mAb J898 to induce apoptosis in the absence and presence of the same concentration of soluble antibodies directed against a variety of surface molecules .
The percent of cell death was measured cytofluorimetrically as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
The mAbs used were anti-CD43 ( J893 , G19-1 ) , anti-CD18/62-integrin ( 60.3 ) , anti-CD29/Bl-integrin ( P4C10 ) , anti-CD8 ( 619-4 ) , anti-CD49d/ad-integrin ( P4C2 ) , anti-CD28 ( 2612 ) , and anti-MHC class I ( W6/82 ) .
Under these conditions none of the antibodies tested , with the exception of mAb J898 , were capable of inducing apoptosis as soluble , single reagents ( data not shown ) .
mAbs specific for either CD3 , CD43 , CD18 ( B2-integrin ) , or CD29 ( B1-integrin ) increased the level of apoptosis from 42 % to as much as 65 % after 24 h. Costimulation with either anti-MHC class I , anti-CD28 , or anti-CD49d ( « 4-integrin ) reduced the level of apoptosis induced by mAb J393 , demonstrating that 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Induction of Apoptosis in T-cells by Anti-CD43 mAb 60 50 -I 40 30 % Cell Death 20 10 100 % Cell Death 20 T T 0.1 1 10 100 mAb J393 , ug/ml Fic .

Concomitant ligation of J393/CD43 with either G10-2/ CD43 or CD3/TcR synergized to induce cell death .

The percent of cell death was determined by flow cytometry as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
Under these conditions mAb G10-2 and mAb G19-4 induced cell death < 5 % when used as soluble , single reagents ( data not shown ) .
only certain surface molecules interact to potentiate J393/ CD43 signaling events .
A synergistic enhancement in cell killing was observed at suboptimal concentrations of mAb J393 in the presence of anti-CD43 mAb G10-2 ( Fig .
6A ) or anti-CD3 mAb G19-4 ( Fig .
6B ) .
Apoptosis was enhanced over 2-fold by the simultaneous ligation of both isoforms of CD43 expressed in Jurkat cells .
However , the greatest killing was observed by the simultaneous ligation of J393/CD43 and CD3/TcR .
In these experiments 10 % of the cell population were killed with 0.9 ug/ml mAb J393 ; however , in the presence of soluble anti-CD3 mAb this same concentration of mAb J393 induced 60 % killing , a 6-fold increase in the level of apoptosis .
To address whether the costimulation responsible for the increase in apoptosis was due to the activation-induced production of the ligand for CD95/Fas ( 53 ) , Jurkat cells were costimulated with mAb J393 and mAb G19-4 ( anti-CD3 ) in the presence of antibodies that block CD95/Fas-induced apoptosis or in the presence of soluble CD95/Fas-Ig fusion protein .
Neither CD95/Fas blocking antibodies nor CD95/Fas-Ig affected the synergistic killing observed with costimulation of CD43/CD3 ( data not shown ) .
mAb J393/CD43-Induced Protein Tyrosine Phosphoryl-ation-Protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays an essential role in the signal transduction pathways of several T-cell surface molecules including the CD3/TcR , CD4 , CD8 , and CD28 ( 54 ) .

Concomitant ligation of J393/CD43 and CD3/TcR synergized to increase protein tyrosine phosphorylation .
Jurkat cells were treated at 37 °C for the indicated time in minutes with either 5 ug/ml anti-CD48/mAb J898 , 10 ug/ml anti-CD3/G19-4-sFv fusion protein , or a combination of both reagents .
Changes in the pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation were examined by immunoblotting anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
In the above phosphotyrosine immunoblot , the pattern of phosphorylated substrates differed for each treatment .
Although CD43 does not possess tyrosine kinase activity or contain tyrosine phosphorylation sites within the cytoplasmic domain ( 20 ) , its association with other membrane receptor-tyrosine kinase complexes such as CD3/TcR have been reported ( 11 ) .
Therefore , we examined early tyrosine phosphorylation following mAb J393 or mAb J393 plus anti-CD3 stimulation of Jurkat cells .
Cells were treated with mAb J393 in the presence or absence of the anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment , G19-4-sFv ( 35 ) .
Following costimulation , anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies .
The immunoblot presented in Fig .
7 shows that tyrosine phosphorylation was induced rapidly within 1 min .
The pattern of phosphorylation observed depended on the type of stimulus .
The most significant increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by mAb J393 was found in the range of 90-kDa and below ; in particular those in the range 50 to 34-kDa .
By comparison , G19-4-sFv-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins above 100-kDa as well as those below 90-kDa but did not induce phosphorylation of proteins in the range of 50-55-kDa range .
Costimulation with both antibodies resulted in the hyperphosphorylation of multiple substrates in the range of 150 to 34-kDa range .
In contrast , neither G10-2 nor 619-1 induced an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation ( data not shown ) .
Regulation of TJ393/CD43-induced Apoptosis by Phosphotyrosine Kinase Inhibitors-It was apparent that mAb J393-induced tyrosine phosphorylation peaked at 5 min and rapidly diminished thereafter .
Since the dephosphorylation of specific substrates might be involved in down-regulat-ing CD43-induced signals , we examined the effect of tyrosine phosphatase inhibition on mAb J393-induced apoptosis .
Jurkat cells pretreated overnight with the phosphotyrosine phosphatase ( PTPase ) inhibitor , BMLOV ( 55 ) , were found to be more responsive to the induction of apoptosis by mAb J393 .
As shown in Fig .
8A , BMLOV was not toxic to Jurkat cells ; however , it enhanced mAb J393-induced killing in a dose-dependent manner .
The level of cell death increased from 32 to 65 % as a result of treatment with 45 um BMLOV .
Inhibition of PTPase activity by BMLOV had less effect on anti-CD3-induced apoptosis , whether used alone or in combination with mAb J393 .
The effect of inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity on apoptosis was also examined .
In Fig .
8B , the level of apoptosis induced by mAb J393 was reduced from 35 to 16 % in the presence of the 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 27692 80 A 60 < d A 2 40 `` C O x 20 a- -4 & -- -- -- ® 0 T T T T 0 10 20 30 40 50 BMLOV , LM B Untreated 619-4 Herbimycin A J393 4393 + Herbimycin A 1393 + 619-4 J393 + G19-4 + Herbimycin A 0 20 40 680 80 100 % Cell Death Fic .

Modulating the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation modulates the level of mAb J398-induced apoptosis .
A , Jurkat cells were treated for 24 h with 5 pg/ml anti-CD48/mAb J898 and 10 ug/ml anti-CD8/mAb G19-4 in the presence of varying doses of the PTPase inhibitor BMLOV following an overnight pretreatment with the inhibitor .
The level of apoptosis was determined cytofluorimetrically as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
BMLOV treatment alone ( @ -- @ ) or in combination with mAb G19-4 ( M -- R ) had minimal effect on apoptosis ; however , BMLOV acted in a dose-dependent manner to enhance cell death induced by mAb J898 ( & -¥ ) or mAb J398 + mAb G19-4 ( @ -- @ ) .
B , Jurkat cells were treated for 24 h with 5 ug/ml mAb J398 and 10 ug/ml G19-4 in the presence of 3 uM of the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A following a 6-h pretreatment with the inhibitor .
Herbimycin A treatment alone had little effect on apoptosis ; however , herbimycin A acted to decrease the level of cell death induced by mAb J398 or mAb J398 + mAb G19-4 .
tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A .
Furthermore , apoptosis induced by treating Jurkat cells with mAb J393 plus anti-CD3 was inhibited 95 % by herbimycin A .
These results strongly suggested a role for protein tyrosine phosphorylation/ dephosphorylation events in regulating CD43-mediated signals leading to an apoptotic response .
mAb J393-induced Alterations in the Nuclear Localization of Transcriptional Regulatory Proteins-In order to determine whether mAb J393-induced signal transduction events might lead to downstream alterations in gene activation , we exam ined the effects of anti-CD43 mAb J393 , anti-CD3 mAb G19-4 , Induction of Apoptosis in T-cells by Anti-CD43 mAb Untreated G19.4 1393 G19.4 + 1393 I E < -NF- KB hand lung lang bet < -AP-1 l—JUHH -Oct tad band « = -- IRE Fic .

Apoptosis induced by mAb J393 is associated with alterations in the nuclear localization of NF- « B and IRE transcription factors .
Actively growing Jurkat cells were treated with 5 ug/ml anti-CD48/mAb J893 , 10 pg/ml antiCD3/mAb G19-4 , or a combination of the two antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C .
These cells were used in the preparation of nuclear extracts for the detection of specific DNA-binding proteins by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
The above phosphorimages of non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis show the high M , shift in radiolabel due to binding of specific `` °P-labeled oligonucleotides to nuclear proteins .
Treatment by mAb J898 alone or in combination with mAb G19-4 resulted in a decrease in the amount of NF-kB and IRE in the nucleus but did not affect AP-1 or Oct levels .
and a combination of both antibodies on the nuclear localization of the transcriptional factors NF-kB , AP-1 ( fos/jun ) , octa-mer , and interferon-inducible regulatory element ( IRE ) DNA-binding proteins .
Jurkat cells ( 1 X 10 `` ) were aliquoted in 1-ml volumes containing either mAb 619-4 ( anti-CD3 ) , mAb J393 ( anti-CD43 ) , each at 10 ug/ml , a combination of both , or left untreated .
The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and pelleted by centrifugation , and nuclear extracts were prepared for analysis as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
As shown in Fig .
9 , BMS-2 cells had constitutively elevated levels of the four transcription factors within the nucleus .
Treatment of the cells with mAb J393 had a marked effect on reducing the nuclear levels of both NF- « B and IRE binding proteins but not AP-1 or Octamer .
Treatment of the cells with mAb G19-4 had little effect on nuclear levels of these factors , whereas combined antibody treatment inhibited nuclear localization the greatest degree .
Expression of mAb J393 Epitopes in T-lymphocytes-Using flow cytometry we examined several different cell types of hematopoietic origin and found the expression of J393/CD43 to be highly restricted ( data not shown ) .
All lineages known to express CD43 were reactive with mAb G10-2 .
By contrast , mAb J393 failed to react with human erythrocytes , platelets , neu-trophils , eosinophils , monocytes , T- and B-lymphocytes , freshly isolated CD34 `` bone marrow-derived precursor cells , and freshly prepared thymocytes .
However , immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates revealed the presence of mAb J393 epitopes in both resting and activated peripheral blood T-lymphocytes .
As shown in Fig .
10 , resting T-cells predominantly expressed the 120-kDa mAb G10-2-reactive isoform of CD43 that appeared to decrease following cellular activation .
By comparison , resting T-cells expressed a very low level of mAb J893 reactivity that was elevated following activation .

resting or activated T-lymphocytes ; however , a higher 160-kDa band of reactivity specific for mAb J393 was present in activated cells .
It should be noted that in activated T-cells mAb J393 and mAb G10-2 cross-reacted with isoforms of CD43 that were of 97 kDa or smaller .
As a further demonstration of mAb J393 reactivity with human T-lymphocytes , PHA-activated peripheral T-cells were fixed , permeabilized , and immunostained as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
Examination of this preparation by confocal microscopy revealed localization of mAb J393 antigen at or near the plasma membrane ( Fig .
11 ) .
DISCUSSION The existence of a CD43-mediated pathway for signaling apoptosis in T-cell lineages has not been previously described .
Our observation that the BMS-2 Jurkat cell line co-expressed two antigenically distinct isoforms of CD43 on its surface provided us with a good model for examining structure-function relationships between these two molecules .
While both mAb J393 and mAb G10-2 induced homotypic adhesion , only mAb J393 induced apoptosis .
This implied that the apoptotic response was independent of the homotypic adhesion phenomenon and was associated with a specific CD43 isoform .
The reactivity of mAb G10-2 required terminal sialic acid moieties , whereas reactivity of mAb J893 was sialic acid-independent .
Other investigators have observed sialic acid-independent CD43 antibodies to elicit stronger cellular responses than their sialic acid-dependent counterparts ( 10 ) .
We found the carbohydrate structure of J393/CD43 in Jurkat cells to be deficient in oligosaccharide complexity and sialic acid content when compared with that of the G10-2/CD43 isoform expressed in HPB-ALL cells .
The majority of serine/threonine residues in the extracellular portion of the J393 antigen contained only terminal GaINAc monosaccharides , similar to the Tn antigen-bear-ing CD43 molecule expressed in Jurkat cells ( 50 ) .
Glycopeptides generated from intact mAb J393 antigen lost functional epitope as determined by immunoaffinity chromatography run under conditions that favor interaction of low valency glycopeptides with the antibody .
Low valency for antibodies has been reported for glycopeptides containing the cluster antigens of Tn when compared with intact glycoprotein ( 56 ) .
Although mAb J393 likely recognizes the T ' n-containing isoform of CD43 , it does not react with the surface of certain cell types expressing Tn epitopes .
Therefore , we propose that mAb J893 recognizes a unique epitope on CD43 that has not been previously characterized .

Detection of mAb J393/CD43 epitopes in peripheral blood T-cells .
Enriched preparations of PHA-activated peripheral blood T-cells were fixed , permeabilized , immunostained with mAb J398 , and examined by confocal microscopy as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
This confocal micrograph depicts the intracellular localization of mAb J898 epitopes in T-cells .
Little is known about how CD43 functions as a signaling molecule .
We find that soluble , bivalent antibody is sufficient to initiate a CD43 signal , unlike the requirement for trimeric ligation by members of the TNF receptor superfamily including CD95/Fas ( 57 ) .
In T-lymphocytes , CD43 has been shown to be constitutively phosphorylated in resting cells and hyperphosphorylated following cellular activation ( 58 ) .
Because CD43 contains no catalytic region or tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain , its phosphorylation is thought to reflect its association with serine/threonine-specific protein kinases ( 59-61 ) .
However , investigators characterizing CD43 as a CD28-independent costimulatory molecule have described the physical association of CD43 with CD3 in a complex containing the SRC family protein tyrosine kinases Ick and fyn ( 11 ) , suggesting an involvement of CD43 with tyrosine phosphorylation events .
Indeed , pretreatment of Jurkat cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A significantly interfered with mAb J393-induced cell death .
We found that treatment of Jurkat cells with mAb J393 induced a rapid increase in overall protein tyrosine phosphorylation and , in particular , for proteins in the 50-55-kDa range .
Interestingly , this group of proteins was not phosphorylated following engagement of CD3/ TcR , suggesting a degree of specificity in the pattern of CD43-induced tyrosine phosphorylation .
Moreover , concomitant ligation of J393/CD43 and CD3/TcR resulted in the hyperphosphorylation of these CD43-dependent substrates , providing a biochemical correlate for the synergy observed for these two receptor molecules in mediating apoptosis .
Collectively , these findings suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation of specific substrates is important in signaling CD43-mediated apoptosis .
We found that preventing dephosphorylation of phosphoty-rosyl residues by blocking phosphatase activity resulted in a significant enhancement in mAb J393-induced cell death .
Thus , the PTPase inhibitor BMLOV mimicked the action of CD3/TcR in potentiating CD43-mediated cell death , seemingly consistent with a hyperphosphorylated state .
These results indicate that the catalytic activity of BMLOV-sensitive phos- 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 27694 phatases negatively regulates CD43-mediated apoptosis .
It is likely that the potentiation of CD43-mediated apoptosis by CD3/IcR engagement involves CD45 phosphatase activity since CD45 is expressed in high abundance in Jurkat cells and is required to activate TcR-associated SRC family kinases allowing for competent antigen-induced signal transduction ( 62 , 63 ) .
Therefore , in this context CD45 may be positively regulating CD43-mediated apoptosis by directly enhancing kinase activity .
Notably , BMLOV treatment of Jurkat cells does not interfere with TcR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation ( 55 ) which may explain why BMLOV treatment did not block the synergism we observed for TcR/CD43-induced apoptosis .
Con-versely , the catalytic activity of SH2 PTPases may be expected to exert a negative regulatory effect on CD43-mediated apoptosis , since PTPIC has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling in B-lymphocytes as confirmed in PTP1C-deficient mice expressing the motheaten phenotype ( 64 ) .
Further investigation is necessary to identify which enzymes and substrate sites are involved in this CD43-mediated pathway .
It was recently reported that CD3/TcR-induced apoptosis in T-cells is mediated by the autocrine production of the ligand for CD95/Fas ( FasL ) , thereby activating the CD95/Fas receptor signaling pathway ( 65 ) .
Interestingly , a requirement for tyrosine kinase activation in CD95/Fas-mediated programmed cell death has been described in conjunction with a requirement for ceramide-initiated RAS activation ( 66 , 67 ) ; however , these signals alone were not sufficient for subsequent apoptosis .
We found that neither a blocking antibody to CD95/Fas nor the competing fusion protein CD95/Fas-Ig prevented J393/CD43-induced apoptosis , making it unlikely that FasL was mediating this response .
Moreover , we observed that combined engagement of J393/CD43-CD3/TcR leads to a rapid reduction in the nuclear localization of NF- « B and IRE regulatory proteins normally associated with transcriptional activation of the FasL gene ( 68 ) .
Likewise , since sphingomyelinase-dependent NF-kB activation has been reported to lead to apoptosis signaled by the TNF receptor-1 `` death domain `` ( 69 ) , it is unlikely that TNF receptor-1 is involved in J393/CD43-mediated killing .
Therefore , engagement of CD43 may define a distinct signaling pathway for programmed cell death that differs from that of the TNF-nerve growth factor receptor family .
Perhaps in the BMS-2 Jurkat cells , constitutive activation and nuclear localization of NF- « B and IRE DNA-binding proteins are critical for continued proliferation ; hence , a decrease in nuclear localization of these transcriptional factors may lead to molecular events that promote growth arrest and eventual suicide .
Recent findings in CD43-deficient T-cells generated by homolo-gous recombination indicate that CD43 acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation and proliferation ( 8 ) , which may reflect our observation that CD43 signaling can suppress the activity of transcriptional regulators of early T-cell activation genes .
While mAb J393 reacted strongly with Jurkat cell surfaces , it failed to immunostain the surface of either resting or activated peripheral blood T-lymphocytes .
However , immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of several mAb J393-reactive proteins in the lysates of activated T-cells , possibly representing intracellular intermediates of CD43 in the process of O-glycan elongation .
Interestingly , in activated T-cells both mAb J393 and mAb G10-2 cross-reacted with a 97-kDa isoform of CD43 .
Investigators have previously shown that isoform-specific antibodies may cross-react with linear protein epitopes on the deglycosylated molecule and that these epitopes may be modified by glycosylation in conferring antigenic specificity ( 28 ) .
This suggested that the antigenic specificity for these two Induction of Apoptosis in T-cells by Anti-CD43 mAb antibodies developed as a consequence of activation-induced changes in the glycosylation of the core protein .
Furthermore , the mAb J393-specific 140-kDa isoform present in Jurkat cells was replaced with a 160-kDa isoform in activated T-cells .
Pre-sumably , the J393/CD43 intermediate in T-lymphocytes contains less sialic acid than its counterpart in Jurkat cells , thus contributing to its reduced electrophoretic mobility ( 14 ) .
Unlike T-cells from normal individuals , Jurkat cells have been shown to be deficient in B1,3-galactosyltransferase activity , a key enzyme in the formation of complex O-glycan structures ( 49 ) .
Thus , we postulate that the epitope for mAb J898 is tightly regulated in T-cell lineages , normally being masked at the cell surface by the presence of complex carbohydrate chains attached to the CD43 protein .
Our finding that apoptosis can be induced through a CD43-mediated pathway may have physiologic significance in peripheral lymphoid tissues such as the thymus and lymph nodes , since the inhibition of O-glycan elongation in T-cells potenti-ates the apoptotic effect of galectin-1 , an endogenous ligand for CD43 expressed at these sites ( 70 ) .
Concomitant engagement of specific integrin molecules may serve to modulate CD43-induced responses as our data suggest , in addition to the specific regulation of integrin expression mediated by CD43 as observed by others ( 71 ) .
We propose that the truncated O-glycan structure of the J393/CD43 molecule represents a molecular phenotype with an altered affinity or specificity for natural ligands involved in cell-cell interactions and that following its ligation an apoptotic response may be triggered in appropriate cell types .
As mentioned previously , abnormalities in O-glycan biosyn-thesis are found in a variety of pathologic conditions involving hematopoietic and immunologic disorders , often correlating with the appearance of Tn antigen and autoantibodies to cell-surface molecules including CD43 ( 14 , 18 , 72 ) .
These findings suggest that the expression of alternatively glycosylated isoforms of CD43 may contribute to the progression of such diseases by promoting T-cell deficiency and lymphopenia as a consequence of programmed cell death .
