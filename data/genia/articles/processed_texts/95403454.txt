A Regulatory Element in the Human Interleukin 2 Gene Promoter Is a Binding Site for the Zinc Finger Proteins Spl and EGR-1* ( Received for publication , April 27 , 1995 , and in revised form , July 17 , 1995 ) Christine Skerka , Eva L. Decker , and Peter F. Zipfel # From the Department of Molecular Biology , Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine , Bernhard-Nocht-Strasse 74 , D-20359 Hamburg , Germany Activation of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene after antigen recognition is a critical event for T cell proliferation and effector function .
Prior studies have identified several transcription factors that contribute to the activity of the IL-2 promoter in stimulated T lymphocytes .
Here we describe a novel regulatory element within the IL-2 promoter located immediately upstream of the nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NFAT ) domain .
This region ( termed the zinc finger protein binding region ( ZIP ) ) serves as binding site for two differently regulated zinc finger proteins : the constitutively expressed transcription factor Spl and the inducible early growth response protein EGR-1 .
In unstimulated cells which do not secrete IL-2 , only Sp1 binds to this region , while in stimulated IL-2 secreting cells the inducible EGR-1 protein recognizes this element .
In Jurkat T cells , the ZIP site serves as an activator for IL-2 gene expression , and a combination of ZIP and NFAT binding sites is required for maximal IL-2 promoter activity .
These results suggest a critical role of the ZIP site for IL-2 promoter activity .
T cell activation by antigenic peptides in combination with antigen presenting cells induces a cascade of metabolic events which result in the transcriptional activation of a large number of different genes ( 1 , 2 ) .
Among the transcripts induced in the `` immediate early phase , `` i.e .
about 15 min following the activating stimulus in the absence of de novo protein synthesis , are a large number of transcription factors .
These factors are considered to regulate the induction of genes which are transcribed in a second phase , i.e .
the `` early phase . ``
A family of genes , termed `` early growth response genes `` ( EGR ) , which encode DNA-binding proteins with almost identical zinc finger domains is induced directly in the immediate early phase .
The four EGR genes , termed EGR-1 ( 3 ) , EGR-2 ( 4 ) , EGR-3 ( 5 , 6 ) , and EGR-4/pAT133 ( 5 , 7 ) are coordinately regulated .
No transcript is detected in quiescent , nonproliferating T lymphocytes , nor in resting , serum-deprived fibroblasts ; however , all genes are transiently induced in a variety of cells upon mitogenic stimulation ( 8-13 ) .
Although the four proteins are closely related within their zinc finger domains , their flanking regions *This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ( DFG ) Grant Zi 432/2-1 .

are much less conserved .
As already expected from the high amino acid homology of their zinc finger domains , in vitro experiments confirmed binding of all four proteins to the same target sequence , i.e .
GCG G/TGG GCG ( 4-6 , 13-18 ) .
Despite binding to the identical sequence , the amino acid differences in the flanking regions suggest distinct biological functions of the four proteins .
As primary response factors , EGR-1 to EGR-4 are candidates for the regulation of distal gene expression .
Based on their later time course of induction , cytokine genes are likely target genes for EGR regulation in T lymphocytes .
In order to provide evidence for such a regulation , we searched for EGR binding motifs in the promoter region of human cytokine genes .
This approach resulted in the identification of putative EGR binding motifs within the promoter of the human IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor a genes .
The EGR motif in the tumor necrosis factor a promoter has recently been characterized as a binding site for the EGR-1 protein ( 19 ) .
Transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene and IL-2 secretion are essential steps for T cell proliferation , differentiation , and effector functions .
IL-2 gene regulation is analyzed extensively , and several regulatory elements and their corresponding binding proteins have been identified in both the human and the mouse IL-2 promoter ( 1 , 20-24 ) .
In particular , a critical role for IL-2 gene expression has been demonstrated for the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .
This complex factor assembles only in the nucleus of activated T cells and is essential for transcriptional induction of the IL-2 gene ( 25-27 ) .
The NFAT binding region includes a purine-rich stretch and an AP-1 site .
Binding of members of the fos and jun gene family to the AP-1 site has been demonstrated ( 28 ) , and two factors ( termed NFATc and NFATp ) which bind to the purine-rich region directly upstream of the AP-1 site have been cloned recently ( 25 , 29 ) .
The putative EGR recognition element in the human IL-2 promoter is located directly upstream of the NFAT site .
We asked whether this site serves as a binding site for nuclear proteins and whether it participates in transcriptional regulation of IL-2 gene expression .
Here we demonstrate that this G-rich domain is a binding site for the two zinc finger proteins Spl and EGR-1 .
In stimulated Jurkat T cells , this EGR-1 binding element is a novel and important regulatory element for IL-2 gene activation .

A multiplicity of infection of 5 was used .
After 70 h of incubation , cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles , and whole cell extracts were prepared as described ( 31 ) .
The lysis buffer ( 10 mm sodium phosphate , pH 7.4 , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 400 mm KCl , 10 uM ZnCl , , 10 % glycerol ) contained proteinase inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( 1 mM ) , leupeptin ( 56 ug/ml ) , and aprotinin ( 56 ug/ml ) .
IL-2 Reporter Constructs-Specific primers were used for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the indicated regulatory elements using a 417-bp fragment of the human IL-2 promoter region .
Amplified fragments were ligated to the complete ( -253 to +51 ) or to a minimal IL-2 promoter region ( -63 to +51 ) linked to the luciferase reporter gene .

Plasmid pClLue2 was constructed in the same way using primers eu9 and eu6 ( tttggatecAGGA-GGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGA , -279 to -255 ) .
Additional IL-2 promoter fragments generated with primers eu9 and eud4 ( tttggatecG-GCGTTAATT GCATGAATTAGAGC , -253 to -230 ) and with primers eud and eu8 ( tttggatecCATTTTGACACCCCCATAATA , -68 to -42 ; BamHI sites are underlined ) were subcloned into pCR®II vector ( In-vitrogen ) to yield plasmids p4TA and pOTA , respectively .
Inserts were excised from the two plasmids by KpnI and SacI restriction and were ligated into vector pGL2-Basic to yield pClLiued ( -253 to +51 of IL-2 ) and pMILued4 ( -63 to +51 ; i.e .
minimal IL-2 promoter fragment ) , respectively .
For construction of pClLuc3 and pMILuc3 , a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the ZIP site of the IL-2 promoter sequence ( tttggtaccTGTATCCCCACCCCCTTAAAGAAggatee , -8302 to -280 , introduced KpnI and BamHI restriction sites are underlined ) was cleaved and inserted into KpmnI-BaomHI-digested vectors p4TA and pOTA , respectively .
The resulting fragments were excised by Kpn !
and Sacl and ligated into pGL2-Basic vectors .
To engineer a construct with ZIP-NFAT sites upstream of the minimal IL-2 promoter region , a restricted double-stranded oligonucleotide covering the ZIP-NFAT sites of the IL-2 promoter ( -302 to -257 ) was inserted into vector pOTA .
The complete insert was excised and cloned into a KprI- , Sacl-treated pGL2-Basic vector to obtain pMILuel1 .
For plasmid pMI-LUC2 , containing the NFAT region upstream of the minimal IL-2 promoter sequence , plasmid pMILucl was used as template for polymerase chain reaction-amplification with primers eu6 and eug .

After 24 h , transfected cells were stimulated with 1 ug/ml PHA ( phy-tohemagglutinin ; Burroughs Wellcome ) and 20 ng/ml PMA ( phorbol 12-myristate 18-acetate ; Sigma ) .
Cells were harvested by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by incubation in 250 ul of lysis reagent ( Promega Corp. ) .
A 50-ul sample of cell lysate was mixed with 100 pl of luciferase assay reagent and measured immediately at 25 °C using a luminometer ( Berthold Biolumat LB9500C ) .
The initial 30-s integral of light emission was recorded .
All assays were performed in triplicate .
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Mobility Shift Assay-Nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells were prepared as described ( 22 ) with minor modifications .
Briefly , 2 % 10 `` Jurkat T cells stimulated with PHA ( 1 ug/ml ! )
and PMA ( 25 ng/ml ) were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 10 mm KCl , 1.5 mm MgCl , , 1 mm EDTA , 0.5 mm dithiothreitol , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 10 % glycerol , 0.15 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.5 ug/ml leupeptin , 5 pg/ml aprotinin , 10 uM ZnCl , .
Nuclei were centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 5 min , washed , and resuspended in the above solution without Nonidet P-40 .
3 M KCl was added drop by drop to reach 0.39 M , and the extract was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C .
Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 min and stored at -70 ° C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method .
For electrophoretic mobility shift assays , 0.2 ng ( about 10 `` epm ) of *°P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were incubated at 4°C with 5-10 ug of nuclear proteins in the presence of 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) and 80 ng of salmon sperm DNA in 20 ul of 10 mm Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 10 uM ZnCl , , and 5 % glycerol .
For some experiments , EGR-1- and Spl-specific antisera ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) were added after 10 min , and the reaction mixture was incubated for another 20 min at 4 °C .
Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probes on 4-6 % polyacrylamide gels in ( 0.25 x ) TBE at 4 °C .
The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films .
All binding assays were repeated at least five times .
RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting-Total cellular RNA was extracted with guanidinium isothiocyanate and isolated by centrifugation ( 32 ) .
RNA electrophoresis and transfer to nylon membranes were performed as described ( 7 ) .
For hybridization , the following *°P-labeled fragments were used : ( i ) a 2.1-kilobase cDNA insert from plasmid pPacSp1 covering the 696 C-terminal amino acids of Spl ( kindly provided by R. Tjian ) and a pAT 225/EGR-1 cDNA probe representing a 429-bp SphI-Poull fragment of the C-terminal part ( position 1388-1817 ) .

Protein complexes binding to the ZIP ( position -303 to -280 ) oligonucleotide of the human IL-2 promoter .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with nuclear protein extracts prepared from Jurkat T cells stimulated with PHA ( 1 ug/ml ! )
and PMA ( 25 ng/m ! )
for 2 h. Two specific complexes bound to the radiola-beled ZIP site ( Upper and Lower complex ) .
Competition with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled ZIP oligonucleotides showed specificity of both the upper and lower protein complexes ( Zane 3 ) .
Competition with an oligonucleotide representing the EGR consensus site ( GC , ) showed specific competition of the lower band ( Zane 2 ) , while an oligonucleotide with unrelated sequence ( NFAT , , ) had no effect ( Zane 4 ) .
electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( Fig .
1B , ZIP ) .
Two distinct DNA-protein complexes were detected in nuclear extracts prepared from PMA/PHA-stimulated Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
2 , lane 1 , Upper and Lower complex ) .
Both complexes were specific as they were competed by unlabeled ZIP oligonucleotides ( lane 3 , ZIP ) but not by unrelated oligonucleotides ( lane 4 , NFAT , , , ) .
An oligonucleotide representing an EGR consensus site ( termed GC , ) blocked formation of the lower complex ( Fig .
2 , lane 2 , GC , ) , indicating that a member of the EGR gene family participates in binding .
Sensitivity of both complexes to the metal chelator 1,10-phenanthroline and restoration of binding by Zn `` * ions® indicated that zinc finger proteins are forming the two complexes .
As de novo protein biosynthesis is critical for IL-2 gene induction , we investigated whether both protein complexes were pre-existing in unstimulated cells .
In nuclear extracts prepared from unstimulated Jurkat T cells , only the upper complex was observed ( Fig .
3 , lane 1 ) , while both complexes were detected in extracts prepared from stimulated cells ( Zane 2 ) .
Specific antiserum was used for further differentiation and identification of the two protein complexes .
Spl and EGR-1 antiserum specifically interfered with formation of the two complexes .
Antiserum directed against EGR-1 specifically altered migration of the lower complex ( Fig .
3 , lane 3 ) , indicating that EGR-1 gives rise to the inducible protein complex .
The effect of this antiserum was specific as equivalent concentrations of related rabbit antisera did not interfere with binding . ``
Competition of the lower , induced complex with EGR-specific oligonucleotides ( GC , ) ( Fig .
3 , Zane 7 ) are in agreement with the supershift observed with the EGR-1-specific antiserum ( lane 3 ) and confirmed that EGR-1 is part of the lower complex .
The observation that the pre-existing complex required zinc ions for binding suggested that the zinc finger protein and transcription factor Spl was part of this complex .

Identification of Spl and EGR-1 as proteins binding to the ZIP sequence of the human IL-2 promoter .
In nuclear extract prepared from unstimulated human Jurkat T cells , the upper complex is specifically detected and the lower complex is absent ( Fane 1 ) .
However , in extract prepared from Jurkat cells stimulated for 2 h , two complexes are detected ( Zane 2 ) .
Specific antiserum identifies Spl in the upper complex , present in unstimulated and in stimulated Jurkat cells , and EGR-1 in the lower complex of extract prepared from stimulated Jurkat cells ( anes 3 and 4 ) .
Antibody binding to the protein complexes results in a `` supershift `` and in a reduction in mobility .
Competition experiments confirm different binding specificities of the two complexes .
Competition with unrelated oligonucleotides ( NFAT and NFAT , , ) did not affect binding , while competition with an oligonucleotide displaying an EGR consensus site ( GC , ) specifically interfered with formation of the lower EGR-1-containing complex .
Labelled probe against the Sp1 protein specifically altered migration of the upper complex ( Fig .
3 , lane 4 ) , indicating that Sp1 gives rise to the inducible protein complex .
These results indicated that Sp1 binds to the ZIP site of the human IL-2 promoter .
Previously , specific and exclusive binding to G-rich consensus sequences of EGR-1 ( GCG GGG GCG ) and Sp1 ( GGG GCG GGG ) has been demonstrated for EGR-1 and the mouse homolog Zif 268 , for Krox 20 , the mouse homolog of EGR-2 as well as for Sp1 ( 14 , 15 , 18 ) .
Taken together the results suggest that the G-rich region of the human IL-2 promoter serves as a binding site for the zinc finger proteins Spl and EGR-1 .
Therefore , this region was termed the zinc finger protein ( ZIP ) binding site .
Regulation and Binding of the EGR-1 and Sp1 Proteins-To examine the expression of the ZIP binding factors in more detail , a time course of induction was determined on the mRNA and on the protein level .
Spl mRNA was found synthesized in unstimulated ( Fig .
44 , upper panel , lane 1 ) as well as in stimulated ( Zanes 2-6 ) Jurkat T cells , without significant modulation in expression levels .
In contrast , EGR-1 messenger RNA was not expressed in unstimulated cells , but was induced 30 min after stimulation ( Fig .
4A , lower panel ) .
mRNA transcription was independent of protein biosynthesis ( cycloheximide ( Chx ) , lanes 7-9 ) and confirmed EGR-1 as an immediate early gene in T cell activation ( 2 , 33 ) .
Similarly , binding assays of the two proteins paralleled the results obtained by Northern blotting .
Sp1 protein binding to the ZIP site was constitutive , equal levels were detected in unstimulated cells and during the course of stimulation .

Regulation of Spl and EGR-1 expression in the human helper T cell line Jurkat .
A , Northern blot analyses demonstrates constitutive expression of Spl mRNA in the human helper T cell line Jurkat ( upper panel ) .
EGR-1 mRNA was not detected in unstimulated cells , but is detected upon stimulation with PHA ( 1 ug/ml ! )
and PMA ( 25 ng/ml ) ( Fower panel ) .
Total cellular RNA was prepared from unstimulated Jurkat cells ( 0 h ) or from cells stimulated for the indicated times in the absence or presence of cycloheximide ( CAx ; 10 ug/ml ) .
Rehybrid-ization of the filters with an actin cDNA probe showed that equal amounts of RNA were loaded ( data not shown ) .
B , the upper Spl-containing complex is constitutively expressed in Jurkat T cells , and the lower EGR-l-containing complex is transiently induced upon stimulation with PHA and PMA .
Binding assays were performed using 6 ug of nuclear extract prepared from untreated Jurkat cells or from cells treated for the indicated time with PHA and PMA .
A *°P-labeled ZIP oligonucleotide was used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
transiently expressed , and binding was detected 1 and 2 h after stimulation ( Fig .
4B ) .
Later time points did not show any EGR-1 protein complex formation ( Zanes 5 and 6 ) .
Thus , constitutive expression of Sp1 and transient synthesis of EGR-1 following cell stimulation was detected on the RNA level and in the protein binding assays .
The fact that no additional band was detected when both proteins Sp1 and EGR-1 were present in the same nuclear extract suggests that EGR-1 competes with Sp1 for binding to the ZIP site and replaces Sp1 .
Binding Specificities of EGR-1 and pAT133/EGR-4-We asked whether the lower complex was represented by a single EGR-1 protein or by a complex of proteins including EGR-1 .
Determining the binding of recombinant , baculovirus-expressed EGR-1 protein to the ZIP oligonucleotide resulted in one specific shifted band ( Fig .
5 , lane 1 ) .
This complex showed the same binding specificities as the induced complex detected in Jurkat cells , as it was competed with unlabeled ZIP oligonucleotides ( compare Fig .
5 , lane 3 , with Fig .
2 , lane 3 ) , but not with an unrelated NFAT oligonucleotide ( compare Fig .
5 , lane 2 , with Fig .
3 , lane 5 ) .
In addition , antiserum raised against EGR-1 , but not EGR-3 antiserum , abolished binding of the recombinant protein ( Fig .
5 , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Thus , binding of recombinant EGR-1 seems to be independent of additional T cell-specific transcription factors .

Recombinant EGR-1 protein binds to the ZIP oligonucleotide ( position -303 to -280 ) of the IL-2 promoter .
Binding of recombinant EGR-1 , expressed in the baculovirus expression system to the ZIP oligonucleotide ( position -303 to -280 of the human IL-2 promoter ) .
Binding was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay in the absence ( Zane 1 ) or the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled , unspecific ( Zane 2 , NFAT ) or specific ( lane 3 , ZIP ) competitor DNA .
Antiserum raised against EGR-1 affected formation of the complex ( lane 4 ) , while antiserum raised against the related zinc finger protein EGR-3 showed no effect ( Zane 5 ) .
In contrast to EGR-1 , recombinant ATI133/EGR-4 protein , also prepared in baculovirus-infected insect cells , did not bind to the ZIP oligonucleotide ( Zane 6 ) .
However , recombinant AT133/EGR-4 protein bound to the GC , oligonucleotide , which includes a consensus site for the EGR proteins ( lane 7 ) .
four known EGR genes is simultaneously and coordinately induced ( 7 ) , and binding to the consensus site ( GC ; ) has been demonstrated in vitro for the corresponding proteins ( 4-6 , 13-18 ) .
As the ZIP sequence differs from the known EGR consensus site , we addressed the question of whether other EGR proteins could bind to this promoter element .
No binding of baculovirus-expressed AT133/EGR-4 protein was detected ( Fig .
5 , lane 6 ) , although the recombinant AT133/EGR-4 protein recognized the EGR consensus site ( Zane 7 ; GC ; ) .
This result demonstrates different binding specificities of the highly related zinc finger proteins EGR-1 and AT133/EGR-4 .
Preferential binding of EGR-1 to the ZIP region was also strengthened by the use of antisera .
In Jurkat cells , antisera against EGR-1 , but not antisera specific for EGR-2 , EGR-3 , and AT133/ EGR-4 , did interfere with formation of the induced complex.® Regulation of Gene Expression-The in vivo significance of 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 22504 the ZIP site on IL-2 gene expression was analyzed by transfection experiments .
Various hybrid plasmid constructs containing the ZIP and NFAT sites with a regular or minimal IL-2 promoter were linked to the firefly luciferase ( Luc ) gene ( Fig .
6A ) .
Upon transient transfection into Jurkat T cells , the individual constructs responded differently to T lymphocyte activation signals ( Fig .
6B ) .
The complete IL-2 reporter gene construct pCILuecl ( -366 to +51 ) ( Fig .
6A ) displayed regulatory activities characteristic for the endogenous IL-2 gene : it was inactive in unstimulated cells , but luciferase activity was induced 96-fold by stimulation with PHA and PMA .
This induction was abrogated in the presence of cyclosporin A .
* The minimal activity of construct pCILue4 ( -253 to +51 ) , which includes the previously identified binding sites for Oct-1 , NF- « B , AP-1 , CD28RE , NRE , and Ets ( for a review , see Ref .
24 ) , shows the importance of a combination of the ZIP and the NFAT sites for IL-2 gene induction ( Fig .
6B ) .
The high activity obtained with the NFAT-containing construct ( pCILuc2 ) is in agreement with previous results ( 34 ) and underlines the critical role of NFAT for IL-2 gene induction .
A single ZIP site ( pClLuc3 ) increased promoter activity 3-fold and enhanced promoter activity in combination with the NFAT site ( pCILucl ) .
To rule out regulatory effects by transcription factors binding between the NFAT site and position -63 , the transcriptional role of the NFAT or ZIP site was also tested in front of a minimal IL-2 promoter ( pMILue4 ; -63 to +51 ) .
A single NFAT or ZIP element ( pMILuc2 and pMILuc3 ) increased activity of the minimal promoter pMILuc4 , 2.2- and 4.2-fold , respectively ( Fig .
6B and Table I ) .
The 20-fold increase in activity obtained by a combination of one ZIP with a single NFAT site highlights the role of the ZIP and NFAT binding factors in IL-2 gene expression and suggests synergism of action .
DISCUSSION The current study identified a novel protein binding region in the human IL-2 gene promoter , which has a regulatory function in the early phase of T lymphocyte activation .
Two zinc finger proteins Sp1 and EGR-1 were shown to bind to this element .
In unstimulated and in stimulated Jurkat T cells , the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 binds to this region , while in activated cells the transiently induced EGR-1 protein binds this element .
Due to binding of two differently regulated zinc finger proteins , this binding site was termed the zinc finger protein binding region ( ZIP ) .
By transfection experiments , a regulatory function of the ZIP site for IL-2 gene induction was demonstrated in Jurkat T cells .
In PHA/PMA-stimulated cells , the ZIP site activated gene expression , particularly in combination with the NFAT region .
The ZIP site seems conserved in evolution as a highly related element is located in the same orientation in the mouse IL-2 gene promoter ( position -298 to -290 ) immediately upstream of the NFAT binding site ( Fig .
7 ) .
The conservation of the ZIP and NFAT domains in sequence and in location in both the human and the mouse IL-2 gene promoter is in agreement with the proposed role of this element in IL-2 gene regulation .
Although the ZIP site of the human IL-2 promoter does not display a typical binding site for Sp1 or EGR-1 ( Fig .
1 ) , both zinc finger proteins bind to this site .
However , it has been demonstrated that Spl does not bind to the EGR consensus sequence ( 35-38 ) , and , similarly , no binding of EGR-1 to the Sp1 consensus sequence was observed ( 14 , 15 ) .
Despite this specificity of binding to the corresponding consensus se-quences , binding to a range of different sites has been described for Spl as well as for EGR-1 ( 14 , 39 , 40 ) .
We conclude that there *E. Decker , C. Skerka , and P. F. Zipfel , unpublished data .
Zinc Finger Binding Element in the Human IL-2 Promoter is exclusive binding of either Sp1 or EGR-1 to the ZIP site , as the mobilities of the factors remained unchanged , when both proteins were present in the nuclear extract at the same time ( Fig .
3 ) .
The unchanged mobility of both complexes are also in agreement with this explanation .
Overlapping EGR-1 and Sp1 binding sites as described here for the IL-2 gene promoter seem to be of general physiological relevance , as similar regions were identified recently in the promoters of the EGR-1 ( 15 ) , the tumor necrosis factor « ( 19 ) , the mouse adenosine/deaminase ( 39 ) , and the mouse thrombospondin 1 gene ( 40 ) .
Thus , competitive binding of these two distinct zinc finger proteins seems to play a critical role in gene regulation .
Further experiments will clarify whether other Sp1 elements , found in a variety of gene promoters , can serve as binding sites and regulatory domains for inducible EGR proteins .
For the ZIP element of the IL-2 promoter , we could demonstrate preferential binding of EGR-1 but not of AT133/EGR-4 ( Fig .
3 ) .
This is the first time that different binding specificities are reported for two members of this protein family .
Although all four members of the EGR zinc finger gene family are coordinately induced upon mitogenic stimulation of T cells , binding of the individual proteins to their target sequences seems tightly regulated .
Specificity of binding may be regulated by binding to slightly modified target sequences or by interactions with factors binding in close proximity of the identified binding region .
The significance of the ZIP site on IL-2 gene expression was demonstrated in vivo by transfection experiments using plasmid constructs containing the ZIP and NFAT site with a regular or minimal IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
6A ) .
The complete IL-2 reporter gene construct pCILucl displayed regulatory activities characteristic of the endogenous IL-2 gene , and induction was completely abrogated in the presence of cyclosporin A .
The previously identified binding sites for Oct-1 , NF- « B , AP-1 , CD28RE , NRE , and Ets are all included in construct pCllLued4 .
However , the low activity obtained with this construct demonstrates that these sites alone have a minimal effect on transcription .
The high activity obtained with the NFAT-containing construct ( pCILuc2 ) demonstrates the important role of this regulatory element for IL-2 gene induction in T cells .
A single ZIP element ( pCILuc3 ) increased promoter activity ; however , in context with the regular IL-2 promoter , the activating effect of a single NFAT region was more pronounced than that of a single ZIP site .
The increase in activity observed with a combination of the two sites ( pCILiuc1 ) suggests an additive effect of the binding proteins .
A regulatory activity of the ZIP and NFAT elements and a possible interaction of the binding factors are confirmed from the minimal IL-2 promoter constructs .
Regulatory effects by transcription factors binding to the identified sites located between the NFAT site and position -63 were ruled out by analyzing the NFAT or ZIP sites in front of a minimal IL-2 promoter ( pMILuc4 ; -63 to +51 ) .
A single NFAT or ZIP element ( pMILuc2 and pMILuc3 ) increased activity of the minimal promoter pMILuc4 , 2.2- and 4.0-fold , respectively ( Fig .
6B ) .
The 20-fold increase in activity obtained by an IL-2 promoter element including the NFAT and the ZIP site , highlights the role of the ZIP and NFAT binding factors in IL-2 gene expression and suggests synergism of action .
Binding of the zinc finger protein EGR-1 to the ZIP site was demonstrated in stimulated Jurkat cells , suggesting that EGR-1 protein functions as a positive regulator of IL-2 gene transcription .
Previous studies have shown that EGR-1 can function equally well as an activator and repressor of gene expression ( 5 , 14 , 15 , 19 , 39 , 40 ) , and different functional domains have been localized within the protein ( 41 ) .

pMILuc1 100,0 % pMILuc2 13,4 % pMILuc3 19,0 % pMILuc4 4,8 % combination with the experimental results suggests an interaction between their binding factors .
Several proteins which are regulated differently have been shown to bind to the NFAT element ( 42 , 43 ) .
NFAT is composed of a pre-existing cytoplas-mic component ( NFATe/p ) that translocates into the nucleus upon T cell activation ( 25 , 29 , 44 ) .
There it interacts with the Luciferase activity ( % ) ubiquitous , newly synthesized AP-1 component to form a protein complex .
Neither the two recently cloned NFAT proteins ( NFATp and NFATc ) nor EGR-1 display a common motif indicative for this kind of interaction .
Additional experiments aimed at describing the interaction of these transcription factors will contribute to an understanding of their synergism of action .
