Previously , we demonstrated that granulocyte colony- stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) receptor mR N A was undetectable and granulocyte maturation blocked in CCAAT enhancer binding protein « ( C/ EBPa ) -deficient mice .
This phenotype is distinct from that of G-CSF receptor~'~- mice , suggesting that other genes are likely to be adversely affected by loss of C/ EBPa .
Here we demonstrate loss of interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) receptor and IL-6-responsive colony-forming units ( CFU-IL6 ) in C/EBPa~'~ mice .
The observed failure of granulopoiesis could be rescued by the addition of soluble IL-6 receptor and IL-6 or by retroviral transduction of G-CSF receptors , demonstrating that loss of both of these receptors contributes to the absolute block in granulocyte maturation observed in C/ EBPa-deficient hematopoietic cells .
The results of these and other studies suggest that additional C/ EBP « target genes , possibly other cytokine receptors , are also important for the block in granulocyte differentiation observed in vivo in C/ EBPa « -deficient mice .
Key words : hematopoiesis « myelopoiesis Multipotential hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into all of the different lineages of blood cells The processes of distinct lineage differentiation is regulated by distinct transcription factors such as GAT A-1 for erythroid cells , PU.1 for myeloid and B cells , and CCAAT enhancer binding protein « ( C/EBPa ) ' for granulocytes ( 1 , 2 ) .
The molecular basis for how these factors regulate hematopoietic stem cell differentiation is still not clear .
Interestingly , all of these factors can positively regulate the expression of lineage-specific growth factor receptors .
For example , GATA-1 activates the erythropoietin receptor promoter ( 3 ) , PU.1 is critical for M-CSF receptor promoter activity ' A bbreviations used in this paper : C/EBP , CCAAT enhancer binding pro-tein ; CFU-GM , GM-CSF-responsive CFU ; CFU-IL3 and -IL6 , IL-3 and IL-6-responsive CFU , respectively ; RT , reverse transcription ; SCF , stem cell factor .
1173 CCAAT enhancer binding protein * knockout mice * colony-forming unit ® ( 4 ) , and C/ EBPa « is an important regulator of G-CSF receptor promoter function ( 5 ) .
Therefore , one possible mechanism of transcription factor regulation of lineage differentiation is through activation of cell type-specific cytokine receptors .
C/ EBPa is a member of the C/ EBP transcription factor family ( 6 ) .
O ther members of this family include C/ EBP , or NF-IL6 , which is critical for macrophage activation ( 7 , 8 ) , and C/ EBPe , which regulates granulocyte maturation at a very terminal stage ( 9 ) .
C/ EBPa has been shown to regulate a number of hepatocyte and adipocyte genes ( 10 , 11 ) .
Targeted deletion of the C/EBPa gene in mice disrupts normal glucose metabolism , and homozygous newborn animals die from hypoglycemia within 8 h of birth ( 12 , 13 ) .
In the hematopoietic system , C/ EBPa is expressed specifically in both human and murine myeloid cells ( 14 ) .
It up-regulates several myeloid gene promoters , such as G-CSF receptor ( 5 ) , myeloperoxidase ( 15 , 15a ) , and neutrophil J. Exp .

Recent studies have demonstrated that C/ EBPa expression is selectively maintained during granulocytic differentiation , but is markedly downregulated with monocytic differentiation ( 17 ) .
Previously , we reported that granulocyte maturation was completely blocked in C/ EBPa-deficient mice , but T cell , B cell , and macrophage subsets were normal .
Expression of G-CSF receptor mR N A was profoundly and selectively re-duced , whereas levels of M-CSF receptor , GM-CSF receptor « , and IL-3 receptor « mRNA were all comparable to wild-type ( 18 ) .
No defects were observed in C/EBPa*'~ mice .
However , mice with a targeted disruption of the G-CSF receptor only have a quantitative defect in granu-lopoiesis ; mature granulocyte are still detected at a level 12 % of wild-type ( 19 ) .
These results suggest that in addition to G-CSF receptor , other genes were likely to be affected by loss of the C/ EBPa gene .
Multiple cytokines are involved in the regulation of granulopoiesis , including G-CSF , GM-CSF , IL-3 , and IL-6 ( 20 , 21 ) .
Mice that have been treated with IL-6 have an increased number of peripheral neutrophils ( 22 ) .
Double transgenic mice which coexpress human IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor demonstrate dramatic increases of white blood cells consisting mainly of neutrophilic granulocytes compared with wild-type , single transgenic mice ( 23 ) .
Coadmin-istration of recombinant human IL-6 and G-CSF to irradia-tion-induced myelosuppressed mice caused a synergistic increase in the GM-CSF-responsive CFU ( CFU-GM ) in peripheral blood and bone marrow ( 24 ) .
Loss of IL-6 in G-CSF receptor-deficient mice leads to a significant further reduction in the number of mature neutrophils in peripheral blood and bone marrow ( 25 ) .
All of these data indicate that IL-6 also regulates granulopoiesis , and that IL-6 and G-CSF may have a synergistic effect on myelopoiesis .
The biological effects of IL-6 are known to be mediated through their unique cell surface receptors ( 21 ) .
IL-6 receptors are expressed in many cell types , including plasma-cytoma cells , macrophages , T cells , B cells , and pre-B cells ( 26 ) .
During embryogenesis , it is expressed constitutively at readily detectable levels that do not change significantly during in vitro embryoid body development and blastocyst development ( 27 ) .
In the hematopoietic system , the expression of IL-6 receptor rapidly decreases to undetectable levels during erythroid differentiation , and slowly decreases during granulocyte differentiation ( 28 ) .
IL-6 has been shown to bind to the IL-6 receptor with low affinity ( 29 ) .
However , the presence of gp130 , a signal transducer not only for IL-6 but also for leukocyte inhibition factor ( LIF ) , Oncostatin M , IL-11 , and ciliary neurotrophic factor , together with IL-6 will result in high-affinity IL-6 binding and subsequent signal transduction ( 30 ) .
The cytoplasmic domain of the IL-6 receptor is apparently not required for high-affinity IL-6 binding and signal transduction , since the soluble form of the IL-6 receptor , when complexed to IL-6 , can also trigger high-affinity IL-6 binding and signaling on target cells lacking IL-6 receptor but expressing gp 130 ( 31 ) .
Interestingly , G-CSF receptor and gp130 share significant similarity within their cytoplasmic domains ( 21 , 30 ) .
1174 Here , we demonstrate that the IL-6 receptor is markedly downregulated in C/EBPa~'- mice , whereas the expression level of gp130 in C/EBPa~'~ mice is comparable with the level in wild-type mice .
C/EBPa « ~'~ progenitors do not respond to IL-6 alone in vitro , but a small number of precursors can differentiate to metamyelocytic granulocytes by the addition of soluble IL-6 receptor to the culture .
Addition of G-CSF together with soluble IL-6 receptor and IL-6 induces formation of mature segmented granulocytes C/EBP « ~'~ fetal liver hematopoietic cells also can be rescued in vitro by transduction of G-CSF receptors into the cells by using retroviral infection .
These studies demonstrate that the IL-6 receptor is a second major target gene for C/EBPa .
Restoration of expression of either receptor can restore granulopoiesis in vitro , demonstrating that they are important functional targets for C/ EBPa .
Materials and Methods Hematologial Analysis .
Human recombinant IL-6 ( 500 ng/ ml ) , soluble IL-6 receptor ( 100 ng/ m1 ) , and G-CSF ( 1,000 U/ ml ) , which are all active on murine cells , and murine recombinant IL-3 ( 300 U/ ml ) and GM-CSF ( 10 ng/ ml ) were used in the CFU assays .
Methylcellulose culture of single cell suspensions of fetal liver cells was performed in IMDM medium containing 0.8 % methylcellulose and either 30 % heat- inactivated fetal bovine serum for IL-6 and G-CSF CFU assays , or 20 % heat-inactivated serum for the GM-CSF and IL-3 CFU assays .
10 % Chinese hamster ovary cell-conditioned medium from cells stably transfected with a stem cell factor ( SCF ) expression vector was used as a source of SCF , and 10 % WEHI-3-conditioned medium was used as a source of IL-3 for liquid cultures .

The slides were stained with Wright-Giemsa ( Diff Quik ; Baxter Healthcare Corp. , Deerfield , IL ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Northem Blot Analysis .
Total RNA was isolated from mouse fetal liver , adult bone marrow , spleen , thymus , and peritoneal cells 48 h after thioglycollate stimulation , at which time 90 % of the cells are macrophages .
Total RNA was purified by guanidine iso-thiocyanate extraction and cesium chloride gradient .

Quantita-tion of autoradiography of dried gels was performed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant densitometry software ( Molec-ular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Flow Cytometry ( FACS® ) .
Human recombinant G-CSF and IL-6 were biotinylated by using NHS-LC-biotin ( Pierce Chemical Co. , Rockford , IL ) following the manufacturer 's procedure .
Single cell suspensions of fetal liver and spleen cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated at 4°C for 1 h with biotinylated G-CSF ( 25 ng/ 10° cells ) or IL-6 ( 25 ng/ 10° cells ) .
After washing twice with PBS , the cells were incubated with PE-con-jugated streptavidin .
Cells were analyzed on a FACScan® flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) .
G-CSF and IL-6 ( without biotinylation ) were used as controls .
Retrovius Infetion of G-CSF Receptor-expressing Retrovimuses .
For retroviral transduction experiments , the murine G-CSF receptor cDNA ( the EcoRI/ Xhol fragment ) was inserted into the MND-X-SN retroviral plasmid ( 34 ) .
This construct was stably transfected into the GP+E86 packaging cell line ( 35 ) .
Cells were maintained in HXM ( 10 % fetal bovine serum , 15 g/ ml of hy-poxanthine , 250 pg/ml xanthine , 25 g/ ml mycophenolic acid ) and 0.8 mg/ml 6418 .
The titer of the retrovirus from this pro ducer line was 5 X 10° PFU/ ml .
For infection of fetal liver , producer cells were plated the day before cocultivation .
The following day , when the cells were 80-90 % confluent , they were irradiated with a single dose of 3,000 rad from a `` Cs source .
Single cell suspensions from C/ EBPa wild-type , +/- , or -/ - fetal livers were washed with PBS .
After lysis of red blood cells with ACK ( 0.15 M MH , Cl , 1.0 mM KHCO ; , 0.1 mM NaEDTA , pH 7.3 ) , the cells were resuspended in IMDM medium containing 10 % SCF ( Chinese hamster ovary cell conditioned-medium ) and 8 g/ ml polybrene .
The cells were divided into two cultures , one with retrovirus producer cells , one without .
20 h later , cells were harvested and plated in methylcellulose .
Results C/EBPa'- Murine Myeloid Progenitors Do Not Respond to IL-6 .
- Because of the differences in phenotype between C/EBPa « ~'- and G-CSF receptor- mice , we suspected that other cytokine signaling pathways in addition to G-CSF may be adversely affected in C/EBP « ~'~ mice .
Therefore , to investigate the response of C/ EBPa-deficient cells to various cytokines , methylcellulose CFU assays were performed using liver hematopoietic cells .
As shown in Table 1 , the total colony numbers from -/- mice are quantitatively equal to those from wild-type mice in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-3 .
We also observed mature granulocytes in colonies derived from C/EBPa « ~'~ mice in the presence of IL-3 or GM-CSF , as shown in Fig .

The concentration of cytokines is as described in Materials and Methods .
Colonies containing > 50 cells were counted after 6-7 d. Three to five animals of each genotype were analyzed .
Wild-type animals ( +/+ ) gave a result similar to that obtained from heterozygous animals ( +/- ) .
The number of CFU -IL6 from C/ EBPa~~ livers was derived from only three colonies in one plate , which morphologically showed all macrophages after cytocentrifugation of the colonies onto slides and staining with Wright-Giemsa .
Differential counts were performed as follows : two to four colonies were pooled from each plate on two successive days and cytocentrifuged onto glass slides .
The slides were stained with Diff-Quik solution .
The percentages of segmented granulocytes were determined by counting 200-300 cells from each slide , and calculating the percentage of granulocytes in knockout colonies compared with that in wild-type .
Each number was derived from 3 to 4 individual animals and a total of at least 16 colonies for CFU-G and CFU-IL6 .

Each number was derived from a total of 3 to 4 individual animals , and at least 16 colonies for CFU-G and CFU-IL6 .
Immature cells include myeloblasts and metamyelocytes ; segmented neutrophils include band forms .
percentage of segmented neutrophils in IL-3-responsive CFU ( CFU-IL3 ) and CFU-GM-CSF derived from C/ EBPa « - ' - fetal liver is much lower than those from wild-type mice .
In contrast , the percentage of myeloblasts in C/ EBPa « ~'~ mice is much higher than in wild-type mice in CFU assays performed in the presence of IL-3 and GM-CSF , as shown in Table 2 .
In cultures of C/EBPa wild-type hematopoietic progenitors , IL-6-stimulated colonies contained immature and mature granulocytic cells and mature macrophages .
However , C/ EBPa-deficient cells did not respond to IL-6 ( Table 1 ) .
These results indicate that C/EBPa-~'- mice have myeloid precursors that responded to IL-3 and GM-CSF in vitro , but that there is no such population that responded to IL-6 .
Mutation of C/ EBPa Results in Drastically Deceased Expression of IL-6 Receptor and G-CSF Reaeptor mRNA .
To examine whether IL-6 receptor expression is defective in C/EBP « ~'~ mice , we first performed Northern blot analysis As shown in Fig .
2 A , IL-6 receptor mRNA was detected from the liver of day 19 C/EBPa « *'~ embryos .
The signal is weaker than that detected in RNA from adult bone marrow , peritoneal cells after thioglycollate stimulation , spleen , and liver ( data not shown ) .
We did not detect any hybridization from total RNA from the liver of day 19 C/EBPa « ~'~ embryos ( Fig .
2 A , lane 2 ) .
However , we could detect IL-6 receptor using poly A* mRNA from the liver of -/- day 19 embryos ( Fig .
2 A , lane 4 ) .
To quantitate the expression level of IL-6 receptor mRNA , we performed quantitative PCR using RNA from livers of C/EBP « ~'~ and wild-type mice .
The results of the quantitative PCR are shown in Fig .
2 B .
The number of IL-6 receptor molecules per microgram of total liver RNA from wild-type mice was very similar to that published previ- 1176 ously ( 33 ) .
The number of IL-6 receptor mRNA molecules was dramatically reduced in -/- mice , 170-fold lower than in wild-type animals The number of gp130 molecules from -/ - mice was comparable to the number found in wild-type mice , and the number of G-CSF receptor molecules from -/- livers was 17-fold lower than in wild-type livers ( data not shown ) .
These results further support the notion that C/ EBPa regulates G-CSF receptor not only in vitro ( 5 ) , but also in vivo .
Our results also suggest that C/ EBPa directly or indirectly regulates IL-6 receptor but not gp130 mRNA expression in vivo .
Hematopoietic Cells in C/EBP Mutant Mic Have Undetectable IL-6 Receptor and G-CSF Receptor Protein Levels .
O ur quantitative PCR results demonstrated very low levels of G-CSF receptor and IL-6 receptor mRNA , and showed that progenitor cells from mice did not respond to G-CSF and IL-6 in vitro or in vivo ( 18 ) .
To determine the protein levels of IL-6 receptor and G-CSF receptor expression , hematopoietic cells from the liver of C/ EBPa wild-type and -/- mice were labeled separately with biotinylated G-CSF and IL-6 followed by PE-con-jugated streptavidin .
After staining , the cells were analyzed by FACS® .
As shown in Fig .
3 , A , C , and E , G-CSF receptor-positive and IL-6 receptor-positive cell populations are easily detected in C/EBPa*'~ fetal liver and spleen , but there are no such populations detected in -/ - mice ( Fig .
3 , B , D , and F ) .
Therefore , the expression of G-CSF receptor and IL-6 receptor on the surface of C/EBPa « _'-cells is undetectable .
The number of G-CSF receptors on mature granulocytes is much higher than on immature myeloid cells ( 36 ) , and C/ EBPa-~'- animals do not make mature granulocytes One possible explanation for the low level of G-CSF receptors detected in C/EBP « ~'- mice is IL-6 and G-CSF Receptors in Granulopoiesis +/- CFU-IL3 -/-3 Lan .

the absence of mature granulocytes in the liver and spleen .
Therefore , hematopoietic cells from C/EBPa heterozygous and -/- fetal liver were cultured in suspension in the presence of SCF and IL-3 to stimulate both heterozygous and -/ - cells towards mature granulocytic differentiation .
As shown below , SCF alone does not promote granulocyte differentiation or development , but was added to the cultures to promote viability in the absence of other growth factors After 5 d in culture with IL-3 , the cells were cytocentrifuged onto slides and subsequently stained with Wright-Giemsa .
Mature granulocytes appeared in both heterozygous and -/- cultures , but the percentage of mature granulocytes in heterozygous cultures was higher than that observed in the -/- cultures , similar to what was observed in the CFU assays ( Fig .
1 , E and F ) .
The cells were harvested and then stained with biotinylated G-CSF and IL-6 .
As shown in Fig .
3 , G-J , we still failed to observe G-CSF receptor and IL-6 receptor-positive cells from -/-compared with wild-type mice , even after culture in IL-3 induced morphologic maturation in which ~30 % of the IL-6 IL-6 G-CSF cells were metamyelocytes or segmented granulocytes .
These results indicated that although mature segmented granulocytes are not present in vivo in C/EBPa mice , stimulation of C/EBP « ~'~- hematopoietic cells with cytokines like GM-CSF and IL-3 can induce the formation of cells which have the morphologic appearance of mature cells yet still do not express G-CSF receptor and IL-6 receptor .
Therefore , the absence of G-CSF receptor and IL-6 receptor is not simply a result of absence of mature cells , and the G-CSF receptor and IL-6 receptor are truly regu-lated , either directly or indirectly , by C/ EBPa in vivo .
IL-6 and Soluble IL-6 Receptor Together Can Rescue C/ EBPa Granulopotesis In Vitro .
These results suggest that lack of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling due to loss of both IL-6 and G-CSF receptors contributes to the block of granulocyte maturation in C/EBP « _'~- mice .
This phenotype could potentially be rescued by restoration of the receptors on the surface of the cells The cytoplasmic domain of the IL-6 receptor is not required for IL-6 binding and signal transduction , as IL-6 can bind to soluble IL-6 receptor and Figure 3 .

Therefore , fetal liver suspension cells from both wild-type and -/- day 14 to day 16 embryos were used in CFU assays in the presence of IL-6 plus soluble IL-6 receptor , and IL-6 plus soluble IL-6 receptor plus G-CSF , respectively ( Table 1 ) .
There were significant numbers of colonies generated from wild-type mice in the presence of IL-6 plus soluble IL-6 receptors which were morphologically CFU-GM .
When G-CSF was also added , both the colony number and the percentage of mature granulocytes increased as well ( Tables 1 and 2 ; Fig .

Restoration of G-CSF Receptor Expression Can Restore the Production of Mature G ranulocytes In V itr .
_ Granulocyte maturation was completely blocked in C/EBP « _'~- mice in vivo .
This phenotype can only be partially rescued by IL-6 signaling in vitro .
Since G-CSF receptors were undetectable in C/EBPa « ~'~ mice , rescue experiments were performed by transduction of G-CSF receptors into the cells using retrovirus infection .
Day 15 fetal liver hematopoietic cells from C/EBPa « ~'- and heterozygous mice were cul- tured with or without murine G-CSF receptor retrovirus producer cells in the presence of SCF ( added to promote cell viability ) and polybrene .
After 20-22 h , cells were harvested and were plated in methylcellulose in the presence of G-CSF ( Table 1 ) .
In addition , cells were maintained in the same culture conditions without polybrene for an additional 4 d and stained with biotinylated G-CSF to demonstrate induction of high levels of G-CSF receptor by the retrovirus ( Fig .
5 ) .
Colony numbers from C/EBPa heterozygous mice were not significantly different with or without G-CSF receptor retrovirus infection .
No colonies were observed in cultures from C/EBPa « ~'- mice without retrovirus infection , or with retrovirus infection but cultured in the absence of added G-CSF .
Infected cells from C/ EBPa heterozygous mice also yielded no colonies when cultured without G-CSF .
Colonies were observed from G-CSF receptor retrovirus-infected C/EBPa~'- cells in the presence of G-CSF , but less than the number from C/ EBPa heterozygous hematopoietic cells after retrovirus infection ( Table 1 ) .
Mature granulocytes could be detected in the -/ - colonies ( Fig .
4 F ) .
Interestingly , when infected cells were plated in medium in the presence of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor in addition to G-CSF , the colony numbers were only slightly increased , but the percentage of mature granulocytes from C/EBPa~'- cells was increased to almost the same level as that from C/EBPa heterozygous mice ( Tables 1 and 2 ) .
Therefore , restoration of both IL-6 receptor and G-CSF receptor levels restored granulocyte production in vitro .
Discussion Previously , we had reported that granulocyte differentiation and maturation were selectively blocked , and the expression of G-CSF receptor mRNA could not be detected by Northern blot analysis in cells from mice with a targeted disruption of the C/EBPa gene .
However , mice with a targeted disruption of either G-CSF ( 37 ) or G-CSF receptor ( 19 ) show a decrease only in the number of peripheral C/EBPo +/- C/EBPo -/ 20 % n A0 800 1 % i i 1 1 , 22 09 m 10 10 1C 10 20 40 60 80 ioc i 1 i i 0 ** rg + r u 1¢ “ II1 1 & 2 10 1180 L Without RV infection With RV infection blood neutrophils but are not blocked in maturation .
Therefore , other mechanisms in addition to G-CSF are involved for induction of granulopoiesis .
In this paper , we show that hematopoietic cells from C/EBPa « ~ ' ~- fetal liver can form CFU-GM in the presence of IL-3 or GM-CSF in vitro .
However , the percentage of mature granulocytes is lower in -/ - than in wild-type cells These results indicate that immature myeloid progenitors are present in C/ EBPa « -~ ' - mice , and those progenitors respond to GM-CSF and IL-3 .
Interestingly , these cells do not mature in response to retinoic acid , a potent inducer of granulocytic differentiation ( 38 ) , given both in vivo and in vitro ( data not shown ) .
These immature cells also do not respond to IL-6 and G-CSF in vitro .
There are several possible explanations for why GM-CSF and IL-3 could stimulate myeloid precursors to differentiate into mature granulocytes in vitro , but granulocytes are not observed in vivo .
First , GM-CSF and IL-3 are not normally produced in the bone marrow , but by activated T cells and mast cells ( 39 ) .
Fetal T cells and mast cells are not normally activated by pathogens because of the protection of the placental barrier .
Consistent with this hypothesis , neither GM-CSF nor IL-3 could be detected in adult bone marrow , during embryonic stem cell differentiation by RT-PCR or during in vitro culture of embryonic blastocysts ( 40 , 41 ) .
These studies suggest that the fetus does not produce its own IL-3 and GM-CSF .
To investigate whether IL-3 could rescue granulopoiesis in vivo , we administered IL-3 into a C/ EBPa*'~ pregnant female that had mated with a C/ EBPa*'~ male .
Day 19 embryos were analyzed , but no mature granulocytes could be detected in C/ EBPa~'~- peripheral blood or fetal liver .
However , since no changes were detected in C/EBPa wild-type fetuses as well , it is possible that IL-3 and GM-CSF may , like erythropoietin ( 42 ) but not G-CSF ( 43 ) , be unable to cross the placental barrier .
Mice deficient in the entire IL-3/GM-CSF/IL-5 signaling pathway revealed normal numbers of total peripheral leukocyte counts and differential counts except for eosinophils ( 44 ) .
These results suggest that GM-CSF and IL-3 are not necessary for Figure 5 .

IL-6 and G-CSF Receptors in Granulopoiesis routine production of mature neutrophils .
These two factors may play a major role in expansion of hematopoietic cells in emergency situations ( 39 ) .
IL-3 and GM-CSF share a common B chain receptor which signals by inducing protein phosphorylation of similar proteins ( 45 ) ; the two cytokines can also compete with each other in binding to their high-affinity receptors ( 46 ) .
All of these studies suggest that there may be a cell population in mice that expresses both GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors on the cell sur-face .
This population apparently exists in the C/ EBPa-'~ mice , but because there is no GM-CSF and IL-3 in the fe-tus , this population might not differentiate in vivo but could nevertheless differentiate in vitro after stimulation with IL-3 and GM-CSF .
The absence of G-CSF signaling alone could not explain the phenotype of C/ EBPa-deficient mice , and IL-6 is another important growth factor for myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation ( 20-22 ) .
Our previous studies suggested that G-CSF receptor and IL-6 receptor stimulated the same myeloid progenitors ( 19 ) .
Therefore , in addition to the G-CSF receptor , the IL-6 receptor could be a candidate target for the C/EBPa transcription factor , and in-deed , the number of CFU-IL6 is drastically reduced in C/EBPa « ~'- mice .
The phenotype of mice deficient in the IL-6 signal transducer gp130 is distinct from that of C/EBPa « -~'- mice ( 47 ) , so we focused our studies on the expression of the IL-6 receptor .
Like G-CSF receptor , IL-6 receptor could not be detected by Northern blot analysis of total fetal liver RNA from C/EBPa~'~ mice .
By quantitative RT-PCR , IL-6 receptor could be detected , but IL-6 receptor mRNA in C/EBPa « ~'- mice is 170-fold lower than in wild-type mice .
As expected , the expression of gp130 is normal in C/EBPa~'~ compared with wild-type mice .
Staining of hematopoietic cells from C/ EBPa wild-type and -/ - fetal liver with biotinylated G-CSF and IL-6 demonstrated no surface G-CSF receptor and IL-6 receptor-positive cell populations in C/EBPa-'- mice .
When C/EBPa-~ ' - cells were induced to differentiate to mature granulocytes with IL-3 and SCF or GM-CSF and SCF , the morphologically mature cells are still IL-6 and G-CSF re-ceptor-negative .
These findings demonstrate that C/ EBPa is a major regulator for both IL-6 receptor and G-CSF receptor in vivo , and mature cells from IL-3 and GM-CSF stimulation in vitro do not express IL-6 and G-CSF receptors .
The proliferation and survival of these cells depend on IL-3 and GM-CSF but not IL-6 and G-CSF .
Mice with a disruption of the IL-6 gene fail to efficiently control infection with vaccinia virus and Listeria monocytogenes , a faculta-tive intracellular bacterium , and in these animals the inflammatory acute-phase response after tissue damage or infection is severely compromised ( 48 ) .
Consistent with this report and our current findings is the additional observation that the acute-phase response is completely lacking in these same C/ EBPa « ~'~ mice ( Burgess Beusse , B.L .
, and G.J .
Darlington , manuscript in preparation ) , perhaps due in part to the loss of IL-6 receptor expression .
Because hematopoietic cells from C/ EBP « -~'~ mice lack normal numbers of IL-6 receptors , no colonies were ob 1181 Zhang et al .
served in CFU assays from C/EBPa « ~ ' - cells when stimulated with IL-6 only .
IL-6 can bind to the soluble form of the IL-6 receptor , and can trigger gp130 signaling on target cells lacking the IL-6 receptor but expressing gp 130 .
When soluble IL-6 receptor and IL-6 were added to C/ EBPa-~ ' ~ cells , CFU were observed at a level 30 % that of wild-type cells .
Interestingly , the addition of G-CSF to the cultures with IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor resulted in increased numbers of colonies and percentage of mature granulocytes in the colonies .
Previously , it has been reported that IL-6 stimulates stem cells in their ability to respond to IL-3 , and when IL-6 is combined with other recombinant hematopoietic factors , including G-CSF , it can augment responses to these factors or even modify them ( 49 ) .
The results presented here suggest that G-CSF signaling may be one of the growth factor pathways whose function can be augmented by IL-6 .
The block of granulocytic differentiation in C/ EBPa « _~'~ mice can only be partially rescued in vitro by restoration of IL-6 receptor .
Therefore , we infected fetal liver cells from C/EBPa wild-type and -/- mice with a retrovirus expressing the wild-type G-CSF receptor .
When the cells were placed in culture without added growth factors , no colonies were detected after retrovirus infection from both wild-type and -/ - mice .
When infected cells from the C/ EBPa-~'- mice were cultured in the presence of G-CSF , cells from -/ - liver generated half the number of colonies compared with wild-type liver , and these colonies contained mature granulocytes in addition to macrophages and immature myeloid cells .
With the addition of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor to the same cultures , the colony number was still lower than in wild-type .

_ Two models of granulocytic development .
( A ) A pluripoten-tial stem cell differentiates into an immature multipotent myeloid progen-itor , perhaps under the influence of transcription factors such as PU.1 ( reference 2 ) .
This cell can then further differentiate to a mature granulo-cyte , either via a CFU-G/ CFU-IL6 precursor which is dependent upon C/EBPa function , or via a CFU-IL3/CFU-GM precursor which is C/ EBPa independent .
( B ) The multipotent progenitor differentiates into an early granulocytic precursor that can respond to IL-3 and/or GM-CSF , which itself is induced to differentiate further under the influence of C/ EBPa to a precursor that responds to G-CSF and/ or IL-6 .
studies have shown that the IL-6 and G-CSF receptor double knockout phenotype is similar to that of the G-CSF receptor alone and , unlike the C/EBP « ~'- mouse , still makes mature granulocytes .
These results suggest that in addition to the IL-6 and G-CSF receptor , some other genes are affected in the C/ EBPa~ ' ~ mice ( 15a ) .
Since the G-CSF receptor and gp130 have a similar intracellular domain and activate similar signaling pathways , our combined data suggest that there is a G-CSF and IL-6 receptor-positive cell population in mice .
The generation of mature granulocytes from this population of cells is blocked due to the lack of IL-6 and G-CSF responsiveness , but another population can respond , at least in vitro , to IL-3 and GM-CSF .
Whether such a population exists in vivo can potentially be addressed once mice with selective restoration of C/ EBPa expression in liver and not blood , and with longer viability , are produced .
In summary , we demonstrate that C/ EBPa may directly or indirectly regulate the IL-6 receptor .
In the absence of C/EBPa , we observed a marked decrease in IL-6 and G-CSF receptor expression .
Neither IL-6 nor G-CSF signaling is required for myeloid cell lineage commitment , but they are likely to play an important role in proliferation and/ or viability of myeloid precursors .
O ur results raise the very interesting possibility ( Fig .
6 A ) that two distinct populations of granulocyte- macrophage progenitors are present in the murine hematopoietic system , one G-CSF and IL-6 dependent and the other IL-3 and GM-CSF dependent .
Alternatively , granulocyte development occurs in several stages , beginning with an IL-3 and GM-CSF-responsive precursor , which itself can further differentiate to become responsive to G-CSF and IL-6 ( Fig .
6 B ) .
This latter model is more consistent with the hierarchical expression of CSF receptors ( 50 ) .
Our data tend to support the first model ( Fig .
6 A ) .
At least in vitro , loss of C/ EBPa mainly affects the G-CSF/IL-6-dependent precursor , and stimulation of either IL-3 or GM-CSF can induce granulocyte formation .
If such a model is correct , it remains to be determined why this latter pathway is incapable of inducing formation of mature granulocytes in C/ EBPa « knockout animals .
