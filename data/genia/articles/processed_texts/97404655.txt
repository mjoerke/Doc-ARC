Received 14 October 1996/Accepted 30 May 1997 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat , an early regulatory protein that is critical for viral gene expression and replication , transactivates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) via its binding to the transactivation response element ( TAR ) and , along with other cellular factors , increases viral transcription initiation and elongation .
Tat also superactivates the HIV-1 promoter through a TAR-independent mechanism , including tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced and protein kinase C ( PKC ) -dependent activation of NF-KB , and inhibitors of Tat and NF-B cooperatively down-regulate this Tat-mediated LTR superactivation .
In this study , a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy using two PKC ( NF-B ) inhibitors , pentoxifylline ( PTX ) and and a stably expressed anti-Tat single-chain intracellular antibody ( sFv intrabody ) was employed to obtain cooperative inhibition of both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication .
Treatment of cells with PTX and Go-6976 resulted in cooperative inhibition of both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication .
In addition , the combined use of anti-Tat sFv intrabodies and the two NF-KB inhibitors retained the virus in the latent state for as long as 45 days .
The combined treatment resulted in more durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication than was seen with the NF-KB inhibitors alone or the anti-Tat sFv intrabodies alone .
Together , these results suggest that in future clinical gene therapy trials , a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy like the one reported here may improve the survival of transduced cells and prolong clinical benefit .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is the primary etiologic agent of AIDS , a fatal disease that results from the gradual destruction of the helper T-cell population in infected individuals ( 21 , 23 , 28 ) .
Tat is a regulatory protein encoded by the HIV-1 genome that plays a unique role in the emergence of the virus from the latent state .
Tat is known to be a potent transcriptional activator of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( 14 , 15 , 33 , 38 , 42 ) .
The sequence in the 5 ' untranslated region of all HIV RNAs called the transactivation response element ( TAR ) ( nucleotides +1 to +44 ) is required for Tat-mediated transactivation ( 3 , 19 , 51 , 58 ) .
Tat binds with high efficiency to a bulge region in a stable stem-loop structure of the TAR RNA and then interacts with a transcription initiation complex ( 26 , 37 ) composed of Tat and DNA- and RNA-binding proteins ( 24 , 25 , 31 , 32 , 42 , 48 , 52 , 56 , 57 ) to primarily stimulate transcription initiation and to increase transcription elongation ( 33 , 43 ) .
Tat has other modes of action as well .
Expression of Tat in human cells in culture leads to transactivation and overexpres-sion of cellular genes encoding cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) , TNF-B , and interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) ( 9 , 10 , 48a , 54 , 59 ) , some of which in turn can activate viral transcription through their activation of NF- « B ( 9 , 10 , 59 ) .
Activation of NF-kB by TNF-a occurs through a protein kinase C ( PKC ) -mediated pathway ( 6 ) .

6486 ements in the HIV-1 LTR can lead to TAR-independent ( NF-kB dependent ) activation of viral transcription by Tat ( 7 , 35 ) .
Superactivation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression is thus induced by the concerted interaction of the cellular transactivator NF-kB and Tat ( 1 , 4 , 7 , 31 , 35 ) .
Therefore , due to its multifunctional roles in viral and cytokine gene transactivation , Tat represents an important target for HIV therapy ( 45 ) .
Intracellular immunization is a form of gene therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and AIDS that is aimed at the stable introduction into susceptible cells of genetic elements that inhibit viral replication , so called resistance genes ( 2 , 26 ) .
Intracellular antibodies , or intrabodies , are a recent addition to the field of intracellular immunization-based strategies that are being used to treat HIV-1 infection ( 11-13 , 20 , 34 , 36 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 44 , 45 , 49 , 55 ) .
The effects of anti-Tat single-chain ( sFv ) intrabodies have been examined in stably transfected CD4 * T lymphocytes ( 44 ) .
These studies demonstrated that anti-Tat sFv intrabodies effectively sequestered Tat in the cytoplasm , blocked its transport to the nucleus of the cell , and inhibited the Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR ( 44 ) .
Moreover , in both stably transfected cells ( 44 ) and transduced peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) from HIV-1-infected individuals ( 49 ) , marked inhibition of HIV-1 replication was observed .
Previous studies have also demonstrated that superactivation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression can be inhibited by cooperative inhibition of NF- « B and Tat ( 4 ) .
In these studies , cells were treated with pentoxifylline ( PTX ) , an inhibitor of PKC , PKA , and NF-kB ( 4 , 6 , 16 , 17 ) , plus Ro24-7429 , an inhibitor of Tat ( 30 ) .
However , the cooperative effect of these two inhibitors on HIV-1 replication was not examined .
Therefore , the present study was undertaken to examine whether Vor .
71 , 1997 combined pharmacologic and genetic therapeutic strategies that are targeted to Tat and are aimed at inhibiting both the TAR-dependent and NF- « xB-dependent Tat activation pathways simultaneously would result in a more potent inhibition of LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication than would any single agent or strategy alone .
Because activation of NF-KB is known to be mediated through PKC , we tested two PKC inhibitors , PTX and G6-6976 , a specific inhibitor of PKC that has been previously shown to have anti-HIV-1 activity ( 48 ) , and evaluated their effects alone and in combination on NF-KB activation and HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression .
The effects of PTX and G6-6976 on HIV-1 replication were also examined in cells stably expressing anti-Tat sFv intrabodies .
In this report , we demonstrate that treatment of cells with PTX and G6-6976 results in cooperative inhibition of both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication .
In addition , the combined use of anti-Tat sFv intrabodies and the two NF-KB inhibitors resulted in more durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication than was seen with the NF-kB inhibitors alone or the anti-Tat sFv intrabodies alone .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .
The human CD4* T-lymphocyte cell lines SupT1 ( SupT ) and Jurkat were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibeo/BRL , Gaithersburg , Md . )
with glutamine ( 2 mM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO ; and 95 % air .
SupT cells stably transfected with pRe/ CMV vector ( Invitrogen ) ( SupT-vector cells ) or constitutively expressing the anti-HIV-1 Tat sFv intrabody termed sFvtat1Ck ( SupT-sFvtat1Ck cells ) were previously described ( 44 ) and were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium with G418 ( Sigma Chemical Company , St. Louis , Mo . )
at 500 pg/ml .
PBMCs were isolated from leukopacks ( obtained from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Blood Bank ) by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation .
The CD4* mononuclear cells were selected from the total PBMC population with anti-CD4-coated cell culture flasks ( GenCell , Santa Clara , Calif. ) .
A total of 20 10° PBMCs were resuspended in 4 ml of Ca**- and Mg**-free phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS/CMF ) -1 mM EDTA-0.5 % human gamma globulins ( Sig-ma ) and incubated on the flask for 1 h at room temperature .
The flask was washed five times with PBS/CMF-1 mM EDTA .
After the final wash , 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and phytohemag-glutinin ( PHA ) ( 1 pg/ml ) was added to the flask , which was then incubated for circa 60 h at 37°C with 5 % CO ; .
Reagents and plasmids .
PTX [ 1- ( 5'-oxohexy1 ) -3,7-dimethyl xanthine ] and Go6976 ( a synthetic nonglycosidic indolocarbazole ) were gifts from Hoechst-Rous-sel Pharmaceutical , Somerville , N.J. , and Parke-Davis Company , Ann Arbor , Mich. , respectively .
DEAE-dextran , geneticin ( G418 ) , and PHA were obtained from Sigma .
Acetyl coenzyme A was purchased from Bochringer Mannheim , and TNF-a was obtained from Endogen , Cambridge , Mass .
pHIV-1 LTR-CAT was obtained from G. Nabel , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , University of Michigan Medical Center , Ann Arbor ; expression plasmid pSVTat was obtained from J. Sodroski , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , Mass .
Transfection experiments .
Transient transfection of Jurkat cells was performed by the DEAE-dextran procedure as previously described ( 7 , 44 ) .
Cells were transfected with either 5 pg of plasmid pHIV-1 LTR-CAT alone or , for cotransfection experiments , 2 pg each of plasmids pHIV-1 LTR-CAT and pSVTat .
The cells were grown in media without or with different concentrations of PTX ( 10 to 300 M ) or G6-6976 ( 10 to 300 nM ) and were used either singly or in combination .
Approximately 48 h after transfection with pHIV-1 LTR-CAT , the cells were stimulated with TNF-a or phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) ; 18 h later , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activity in cell extracts was determined as described previously ( 4 , 5 ) .
In the pSVTat/pHIV-1 LTR-CAT cotransfection experiments , CAT assays were performed 60 h posttransfection .
In all of the transfection studies , control plasmid pSV-lecZ was routinely cotransfected with the specific HIV-1 LTR-CAT plasmid to normalize the transfection efficiency .
The levels of B-galactosidase activity in control and drug-treated cells were the same , suggesting that the drugs did not influence another viral promoter that lacks the classic NF- « B motif and were not toxic to the cells .
Furthermore , separate experiments demonstrated that G6-6976 , like PTX ( 5 ) , did not inhibit the NF- « B-lacking Rous sarcoma virus promoter-driven reporter CAT gene expression ( Fig .
1E ) .
EMSA .
The level of active NF-B in the nuclear extracts of control and treated cells was determined by electophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) ( 18 ) .
A `` P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe encoding the NF- « B motifs was used for EMSA as described previously ( 4 , 5 ) .
HIV-1 challenge experiments .
Stably transfected SupT-vector and SupT-sFvtat1Ck cells ( 10° ) were incubated overnight in the absence or presence of PTX ( 300 wM , final concentration ) and/or G6-6976 ( 300 nM , final concentra- ANTI-HIV-1 PHARMACOLOGIC-GENETIC STRATEGY - 6487 tion ) and then infected with either the laboratory HIV-1 strain II-B or a syncytium-inducing ( ST ) European primary HIV-1 isolate ( obtained from Jan Albert , Karolinska Institute , Stockholm , Sweden ) at a multiplicity of infection ( MOT ) of 0.5 .
Six hours after challenge , the cells were thoroughly washed and fresh medium ( without or with appropriate drugs ) was added .
Supernatants were then harvested on alternate days with resuspension of the cells in the corresponding RPMI 1640 medium ( without or with appropriate drugs ) .
Viral particles in collected supernatants were analyzed by using a radioimmunoassay kit for HIV-1 p24 protein ( DuPont ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( 44 ) .
PBMCs were activated with either PHA ( 4 pg/ml ; Sigma ) or OKT3 ( 10 ng/ml ) , and the cells were cultured continuously in RPMI 1640 medium plus IL-2 ( 20 U/m1 ) without or with the NF- « B inhibitors .
After 3 days of incubation at 37°C , the cells were challenged with either of two SI European primary HIV-1 isolates .
Supernatants were collected every third day and assayed for p24 antigen .
Transduction of PBMCs and CD4* mononuclear cells and HIV-1 challenge .
The sFviat1Ck intrabody gene was cloned into the shuttle vector LNCX MuLV under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter ( 46 ) .
The empty LNCX ( LN ) or LN-sFvtat1Ck vector was transfected by the calcium phosphate method into the ecotropic cell line $ CRE ( 46 ) .
After 48 h , the supernatants from the transfected cells were collected , cleared by low-speed centrifugation ( 3,000 % g ) , and used to infect the amphotrophic packaging cell line PG13 .
Producer cell lines were established by using G418 and hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine selection .
Following establishment of stable PG13 sub-clones by limiting dilution , retrovirus-containing supernatants were harvested , filtered , and used to transduce PBMCs .
Transduction was performed on 3 consecutive days with an initial 6 h of phosphate starvation , followed by a 1-h centrifugation of the cells and retroviral supernatants ( 1,000 x g , 32°C ) and overnight incubation at 32°C ( 8 ) .
The cells were then washed with fresh medium , resuspended in medium supplemented with IL-2 ( 20 U/ml ) and G418 ( 800 pg/tl ) , and incubated at 37°C .
The medium was changed on day 5 .
After 10 days in culture , the cell were washed and stimulated with irradiated human PBMCs ( 5,000 rads ) at a ratio of 1:10 ( transduced cells/feeders ) and PHA ( 1 pg/ml ) .
Four days later , the cells were fed with medium supplemented with IL-2 ( 20 U/ml ! )
and G418 ( 800 pg/ml ) .
When cells started to expand ( circa days 10 to 14 ) , they were washed , equilibrated in medium alone or with PTX ( 300 uM ) plus G6-6976 ( 300 nM ) , and then challenged with either of two SI European primary HIV-1 isolates of HIV-1 .
Viral replication was monitored by the p24 antigen capture assay as described earlier .
Transduction efficiency of the PBMCs was determined by PCR amplification with appropriate primers of the neomycin gene as described by Morgan et al .
( 47 ) .
Twenty-four hours after the last transduction , 20,000 cells were collected and PCR band intensity was compared to the intensity of a quantitation curve .
The transduction efficiency was estimated to be around 10 to 15 % .
RESULTS Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by PMA and Tat .
Basal reporter CAT activity , using our standard assay conditions and the wild-type , unmutated plasmid pHIV-1 LTR-CAT , was stimulated 23-fold by PMA ( Fig .
1A ) .
A markedly greater induction of CAT was observed with Tat ( 259-fold ) compared to the unstimulated wild-type HIV promoter construct ( 1.5-fold ) .
Tat induced an 18-fold up-regulation of the TAR-less HIV-1 promoter with functional NF-kB motifs compared to the basal level of activation seen in unstimulated cells ( 0.76-fold ) , whereas PMA induced a 25-fold upregulation of this TAR-less promoter .
The NF-kB mutant HIV-1 promoter was not activated by PMA compared to the activity seen with unstimulated cells ; however , a 25-fold level of activation was seen with Tat .
These results demonstrate that in Jurkat cells , PMA-induced stimulation of CAT activity is mediated through activation of NF-kB in the HIV-1 promoter , whereas with Tat , stimulation of the HIV-1 promoter is through both TAR-dependent and TAR-independent pathways .
Furthermore , the level of Tat-induced activation of the wild-type HIV-1 LTR is greater than the level of Tat-induced activation of the TAR-less and NF- « xB mutant HIV-1 LTR promoters alone , suggesting that Tat induces a superactivation of the wild-type promoter through the combined effects of Tat on both the TAR-dependent and TAR-independent activation pathways .
Effect of Go-6976 on Tat- , PMA- , and TNF- « & -induced activation of the HIV-1 LTR .
G6-6976 is a synthetic nonglycosidic indolocarbazole and a selective inhibitor of PKC ( 50 ) .

centrations can inhibit HIV-1 replication from latent or low-level virus-producing cells by physiologic activators such as TNF-a and IL-6 ( 50 ) .
We examined the influence of G6-6976 on HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter gene expression in CD4 * Jurkat T cells in the presence or absence of Tat protein .
As shown in Fig .
1B , little activation of the HIV-1 LTR is seen in the absence of Tat ( lanes 3 and 4 ) compared to the activation seen in the presence of Tat ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
In the presence of increasing concentrations of G6-6976 ( lanes 7 through 12 ) , a dose-dependent inhibition of Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR is seen , with maximal inhibition occurring at 300 nM G6-6976 .
The effect of G6-6976 on Tat and PMA-induced activation of was studied by examining the level of HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter CAT gene activity in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with the different pHIV-1 LTR-CAT reporter plasmids .
As shown in Fig .
1C , with the wild-type HIV-1 LTR promoter , G8-6976 inhibited Tat-induced transactivation by 62.3 % .
With the TAR -less HIV-1 promoter , where the effect of Tat is mediated through activation of NF-kB alone , G6-6976 inhibited Tat-induced transactivation completely .
Using the pHIV-1 LTR-mut-NF- « kB-CAT reporter in which the NF-kB motifs are mutated and in which only TAR-dependent LTR activation is measured , G6-6976 inhibited 65.2 % of Tat-induced transactivation of the mutant LTR .
Thus , inhibited the Tat-mediated TAR-independent LTR activation pathway .
In parallel , transfected cells were stimulated with PMA for 12 h ( 20 ng/ml ) .
G6-6976 treatment inhibited PMA-induced transactivation of wild-type , TAR-less , and mutant NF- « B LTRs by 97 , 98 , and 0 % , respectively ( data not shown ) .
The effect of G6-6976 on the TNF- « -induced activation of NF- « B was also studied by examining the level of wild-type HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter CAT gene activity in Jurkat cells treated with TNF- « and transiently transfected with plasmid pHIV-1 LTR-CAT .

In addition , G6-6976 was not cytotoxic at the indicated concentrations ( Fig .
1D ) and had no effect on Rous sarcoma virus promoter-driven CAT expression ( Fig .
1E ) .
Effect of G6-6976 on PMA-induced NF-KB activation of the HIV-1 LTR .
To investigate the effects of G6-6976 on NF- « B activation directly , the level of active NF- « xB was determined by EMSA with nuclear extract from cells stimulated with PMA and treated with different concentrations of G6-6976 .
As shown in Fig .
2 , the level of active NF- « xB was reduced to the unstimulated level following treatment of the stimulated cells with G6-6976 at as low as 1 nM ( final concentration ) .
These results demonstrate that G6-6976 is a potent NF-kB inhibitor and establish a site of antiviral action of the compound .
In this respect , G6-6976 is similar to PTX , which was previously established as an NF-kB inhibitor and which also inhibited HIV-1 LTR activation and virus replication ( 5 , 22 ) .
Effects of G6-6976 and the Tat inhibitor Ro24-7429 in combination on HIV-1 LTR activation .
Previous studies demonstrated that treatment of cells with PTX in combination with Ro24-7429 , an inhibitor of Tat function , resulted in cooperative inhibition of HIV-1 LTR activation ( 4 ) .
The mechanism of inhibition by Ro24-7429 is not known ( 30 ) .
Therefore , the combined effect of G6-6976 and Ro24-7429 on HIV-1 LTR-driven CAT gene expression was examined .

and/or Ro24-7429 .
As shown in Fig .

Quantitative analysis of the CAT assay demonstrated that markedly lower concentrations of the compounds ( 10 nM G6-6976 and Ro24-7429 ) which individually did not cause significant inhibition led to 93 % reduction of CAT gene activity when used in combination .
These results demonstrate that the NF-kB inhibitor G6-6976 and the Tat inhibitor Ro24-7429 in combination cooperatively down-regulate Tat-mediated activation of the HIV-1 promoter .

3B , with Jurkat cells transiently cotransfected with pHIV-1 LTR-CAT and pSVTat and in the presence of different concentrations of PTX and/or G6-6976 , significant inhibition of CAT gene activity is observed .
Quantitative analysis of the CAT assay demonstrated that lower concentrations of the compounds ( 10 to 50 M PTX or 10 to 50 nM G6-6976 which individually did not cause significant inhibition led to 50 to 70 % reduction of CAT gene activity when used in combination .
These results demonstrate that when used in combination , the two NF- « B inhibitors PTX and G6-6976 also cooperatively down-regulate , in a TAR-independent pathway , Tat-mediated activation of the HIV-1 promoter .
Inhibition of HIV-1 infection in CD4* SupT cells and PBMCs in the presence of NF-KB inhibitors .
To determine whether PTX and G0-6976 alone and in combination were able to inhibit HIV-1 replication , we initially performed challenge experiments using human CD4 * SupT cells and either a laboratory strain ( II-B ) or an SI European primary HIV-1 isolate .
The cells were pretreated with PTX , G6-6976 , or both drugs overnight prior to challenge with the different viruses .
Supernatants were isolated on alternate days , the cells were monitored for syncytium formation , and supernatants were quantitated for p24 levels .
Cells treated with G6-6976 alone gave marked protection against HIV-1 whether the cells were challenged with , ( Fig .
4A ) or with primary isolate 1 ( Fig .
4B ) .
This protection was not seen with PTX alone in either challenge experiment .
The combination of PTX and G6-6976 resulted in a small additional protective effect on cells challenged with primary isolate 1 .
Next , we performed similar HIV-1 challenge experiments using PBMCs and two SI European primary isolates .
Cells treated with G6-6976 alone gave substantial protection against primary isolates 1 ( Fig .
4C ) and 2 ( Fig .
4D ) .
This level of protection was not seen with PTX alone .
However , in contrast to the results of the challenge experiments with SupT cells ( Fig .
4A and B ) , the combination of PTX and G6-6976 resulted in a significant improvement in protection compared to cells treated with G6-6976 alone .
This pattern of inhibition of virus replication by the combination of NF- « B inhibitors correlated well with their effects on HIV-1 LTR-regulated gene expression ( Fig .
3B ) .
Prolonged inhibition of HIV-1 infection in stably transfected CD4* SupT cells and in transduced PBMCs and CD4* mononuclear cells expressing Anti-Tat sFv intrabodies in the presence of NF-KB inhibitors .
Since treatment of cells with the combination of NF-kB and Tat inhibitors results in cooperative down-regulation of Tat-mediated activation of the HIV-1 promoter ( Fig .
3A and references 6 and 7 ) , these observations suggested that a combined genetic and pharmacologic treatment strategy might result in a more durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication .
In previous studies , we demonstrated that Vor .

Effects of NF-B inhibitors on HIV-1 infection in stably transfected CD4* SupT cells ( A and B ) or transduced PBMCs ( C and D ) expressing anti-Tat sFv intrabodies .
( A and B ) .
SupT-sFviat1Ck cells ( 10° ) were either grown in untreated RPMI 1640 medium ( C ) or equilibrated in 300 M PTX ( @ I ) , or 300 nM G6-6976 ( O ) , or 300 M PTX plus 300 nM G6-6976 ( @ ) .
Cells were infected ( MOI of 0.5 ) with either ( A ) or primary isolate 1 ( B ) , and cell-free p24 levels were recorded on alternate days .
( C and D ) Transduced PBMCs ( C ) or CD4* mononuclear cells ( D ) ( squares , LN-vector supernatants ; circles , LN-sFvtat1Ck supernatants ) were either grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with IL-2 ( open symbols ) or equilibrated in IL-2-RPMI 1640 medium with 300 M PTX plus 300 nM G6-6976 ( closed symbols ) .
Cells were infected ( MOI of 0.3 ) with SI primary isolate 2 ( C ) or 1 ( D ) , and cell-free p24 levels were recorded on alternate days .
an anti- Tat sFv intrabody , termed sFvtat1Ck , which is directed against the N-terminal activation domain of Tat protein could protect cells from HIV-1 challenge when stably expressed in human CD4* T cells ( 44 ) .
Accordingly , the influence of these two NF-kB inhibitors on HIV-1 infection in anti-Tat sFv intrabody-expressing cells was examined .
Stable SupT-sFvtat1Ck and control SupT-vector cells were challenged with either HIV-1 ; ; or SI primary isolate 1 ( Fig .
5A or B , respectively ) .
With the control SupT-vector-infected cells , large number of syncytia started appearing on days 4 to 5 , and p24 release had peaked on day 12 ( data not shown ) .
Syncytium formation was delayed in the anti-Tat sFv intrabody-expressing cells in the absence of drugs until around day 20 postinfection , and subsequently a significant increase in p24 level was observed in both laboratory strain- and primary isolate-infected SupT-sFvtat1Ck cells at around day 25 .
In the presence of PTX alone ( 300 uM ) , p24 levels were similar to those in the untreated infected cells .
In contrast , cells treated with G6-6976 either alone ( 300 nM ) or in combination with PTX ( 300 M ) showed significantly fewer syncytia or no syncytia until day 30 or 40 , respectively ( data not shown ) .
After around 25 to 30 days , the SupT-sFvtat1 Ck cells that were grown in G6-6976-containing medium start to show increasing levels of p24 , whereas cells grown in PTX-plus-G6-6976 medium showed protection against viral infection for up to 45 days postinfection ( Fig .
5B ) .
Thus , addition of the two NF- « B inhibitors to the anti-Tat sFv intrabody-expressing cells substantially prolonged the protection against HIV-1 challenge seen with the anti- Tat sFv intrabody alone .
Two additional HIV-1 challenge experiments were performed on PBMCs and purified CD4 * mononuclear cells that were transduced with an empty LN retroviral vector or with the same vector containing the sFvtat1Ck gene under the control of an internal cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter .
After G418 selection , the bulk-transduced PBMCs were challenged with SI primary isolate 2 in the absence or presence of PTX ( 300 uM ) plus G6-6976 ( 300 nM ) .
As shown in Fig .
5C , vector-transduced PBMCs were significantly protected from HIV-1 in the presence of PTX plus G6-6976 compared to the level of p24 seen in the absence of drugs , where cell-free p24 was first observed 3 days postinfection .
Likewise , the sFvtat1Ck-transduced PBMCs were significantly protected from HIV-1 compared to the level of p24 seen in the vector transduced PBMCs .
Moreover , for PBMCs that were transduced with the sFvtat1Ck gene and treated with the two NF-kB inhibitors , no cell-free p24 was detected for the entire 18-day experiment .
As shown in Fig .
5D , a similar protective effect of the two NF- « B inhibitors on the vector- and sFvtat1Ck-transduced CD4* mononuclear cells that were challenged with SI primary isolate 1 was observed .
Taken together , these studies demonstrate that the combination of anti-Tat sFv intrabodies and NF- « B inhibitors can prolong the antiviral action of either class of these agents alone .
DISCUSSION The results of these experiments demonstrate that the PKC inhibitors PTX and G6-6976 act cooperatively to inhibit Tat 6492 MHASHILKAR ET AL .

Schematic description of Tat- and NF- « B-induced activation of the HIV-1 promoter .
Steps of the TAR-dependent and TAR-independent pathways of Tat action in superactivating the HIV-1 promoter function are indicated by numerals .
The HIV-1 LTR sequence is shown at the top left , and the TNF promoter is shown on the right .
Steps : 1 , production of Tat protein from the fat gene and its activation of the HIV-1 promoter via binding to TAR ; 2 , upregulation of the TNF promoter by intracellular Tat protein or by uptake of Tat protein released from HIV-1-infected cells ; 3 , elevation of TNF mRNA levels , translation , cellular secretion , and receptor-mediated uptake of TNF , and PKC-mediated release and nuclear translocation of active NF- « B ; 4 , interaction of NF- « B with its motifs in the LTR and TNF promoter , leading to Tat/NF- « B-mediated superactivation of the HIV-1 promoter .
The anti-Tat sFv intrabody sFvTat1Ck blocks nuclear translocation of Tat , and the PKC inhibitors PTX and G6-6976 block release of active NF- « B .
Extracellular mediated HIV-1 LTR transactivation by exerting their combined effects on the TAR-independent LTR activation pathway which is mediated through NF- « B .
This inhibitory effect is also seen in HIV-1 challenge experiments , where the protection against HIV-1 was more durable in the presence of the combined PKC inhibitors than in the presence of either inhibitor alone .
Moreover , when these agents were evaluated together with either anti- Tat sFv intrabody-expressing stably transfected CD4 * T cells and transduced PBMCs and CD4 * mononuclear cells , a even greater inhibition of HIV-1 replication was observed .
Thus , these results support the idea that a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy that blocks simultaneously both the TAR-dependent and NF-xB-dependent Tat activation pathways may be of value in the clinical setting .
The mechanisms by which Tat mediates LTR transactivation are complex .
Previous studies and the data presented here demonstrate that Tat can activate the HIV-1 LTR promoter through both TAR-dependent and NF- « B-dependent pathways ( 7 ) .
Tat has been shown to transactivate several cytokine genes ( 9 , 10 , 48a ) .
Tat-mediated transactivation of the TNF-a promoter occurs through activation of NF-kB , which in turn activates the HIV-1 LTR promoter in a TAR-independent manner .
Activation of NF- « B also results in transactivation of TNF- « and other cytokine promoters and thereby establishes an auto-up-regulatory loop for superactivation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter ( Fig .
6 and reference 7 ) .
The cooperative effect of PTX and G6-6976 on LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication was unexpected .
Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment of Jurkat cells with PTX results in inhibition of both PKC- and PKA-induced activation of NF- « B and that both TNF- « - and PMA-induced J. ViRoL .
activations of NF-kB are catalyzed predominantly by PKC ( 6 ) .
Likewise , G6-6976 is a selective inhibitor of PKC and has been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of TNF- « -induced activation of viral transcription from latent or low-level virus-producing chronically infected cells ( 50 ) .
The present study demonstrates that like PTX , G6-6976 is a potent inhibitor of NF-kB ( Fig .
2 ) ( 5 ) .
Thus , although these drugs have overlapping sites of action on PKC and NF- B , they appear to have an additive , if not cooperative , effect as inhibitors of both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and virus replication .
Further studies will be required to determine if other cellular kinases with nonoverlapping sites of action are inhibited by these two agents .
A previous study demonstrated that superactivation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression can be inhibited by cooperative inhibition of NF- « B and Tat ( 4 ) .
In this study , treatment of cells with PTX and Ro24-7429 resulted in inhibition of HIV-1 LTR-regulated gene expression , and the inhibitory effect of these two drugs in combination , at concentrations that alone did not significantly influence viral promoter activity , was far more than additive .
In the present study , a cooperative inhibition of G6-6976 and Ro24-7429 on superactivation of LTR-driven gene expression was also observed ( Fig .
3B ) .
As with the PTX-Ro24-7429 study , the data presented here demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of G6-6976 and Ro24-7429 in combination , at concentrations that alone did not significantly influence viral promoter activity , was far more than additive .
The results of the combined pharmacologic approaches to simultaneously target both NF-kB and Tat were extended to evaluate a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy that targets both NF-kB and Tat .
Indeed , when these two PKC inhibitors were evaluated together with anti- Tat sFv intrabody-expressing cells , either stably transfected CD4* T cells or transduced PBMCs , a greater inhibition of HIV-1 replication was observed than with either the combined PKC inhibitors alone or the anti-tat sFv intrabody-expressing cells alone .
In addition , although HIV-1 infection eventually spread in the cell culture in these studies , these experiments were performed at high MOIs ( 0.5 ) .
Therefore , this novel combination of anti-Tat sFv intrabody and NF-KB inhibitors may have even greater therapeutic value against HIV-1 in vivo where exposure of CD4* cells to low MOIs may occur .
Interestingly , immune hyperactivation of HIV-l-infected primary T-cells via CD3 and CD28 receptors has been dem-onstrated , and expression of Tat protein recapitulates this phenotype and is associated with increased IL-2 secretion in response to costimulation with CD3 plus CD28 ( 48a ) .
Since the anti- Tat sFv intrabodies are not secreted or released from the cells ( data not shown ) , it is possible that the intracellular antibodies can inhibit both the induction of IL-2 secretion following T-cell activation via the CD3 and CD28 receptors and the release of Tat into the cultures that can result in Tat-mediated transcellular transactivation of cytokines such as TNF- « ( 29 ) .
Therefore , the inhibitory effects of the anti-Tat sFv intrabodies could result in the combined down-regulation of immune hyperactivation of HIV-1-infected T cells and in the auto-up-regulatory loop for Tat-mediated superactivation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter and the transcellular transactivation of cytokine genes in neighboring noninfected cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
In summary , these studies demonstrate that inhibitors of NF- « B and Tat in combination result in a more profound and durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication than inhibitors of either NF- « B or Tat alone .
Such combination of pharmacologic and genetic approaches may enhance the efficacy and/or reduce the toxic effect of individual molecules ; they may also minimize or retard the emergence of drug-resistant or escape Vor .
71 , 1997 variants of HIV-1 .
In future clinical gene therapy trials that target the Tat protein , the addition of a pharmacologic arm , particularly when directed to inhibition of NF-kB , may improve the survival of the transduced cells and prolong the clinical benefit that is seen .
