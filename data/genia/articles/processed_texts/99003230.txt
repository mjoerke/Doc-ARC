Downstream Activation of a TATA-less Promoter by Oct-2 , Bob1 , and NF-B Directs Expression of the Homing Receptor BLR1 to Mature B Cells* ( Received for publication , July 22 , 1998 ) Ingrid Veniamin Pevzner } 1** , Edelgard Kaiser§ , Giinter Bernhardt } , Estefania Ulrich Siebenlist } # $ , Reinhold Forster } , and Martin Lipp $ $ § §§ From the { Department of Tumorgenetics and Immunogenetics , Max Delbriick Center for Molecular Medicine , Robert-Rossle-Strasse 10 , D-13122 , Berlin-Buch , Germany , the §Institut filr Biochemie , Ludwig Maximilians Universitit Miinchen , Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 25 , D-81377 , Munich , Germany , and the { { Laboratory of Immunoregulation , NICHD , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 The chemokine receptor , BLR1 , is a major regulator of the microenvironmental homing of B cells in lymphoid organs .
In vitro studies identify three essential elements of the TATA-less birl core promoter that confer cell type- and differentiation-specific expression in the B cells of both humans and mice , a functional promoter region ( -36 with respect to the transcription start site ) , a NF-B motif ( +44 ) , and a noncanonical octamer motif ( +157 ) .
The importance of these sites was confirmed by in vivo studies in gene-targeted mice deficient of either Oct-2 , Bob1 , or both NF-B subunits p50 and p52 .
In all of these animals , the expression of BLR1 was reduced or absent .
In mice deficient only of p52/NF -B , BLR1 expression was unaffected .
Thus our data demonstrate that BLR1 is a target gene for Oct-2 , Bob1l , and members of the NF- « B/Rel family and provides a link to the impaired B cell functions in mice deficient for these factors .
BLRL/CXCRS5 is the receptor of the recently identified CXC chemokine BCA-1/BLC ( 1 , 2 ) .
The cDNA of human BLR1I was originally isolated from a Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line ( 3 ) , and its homologues were cloned from murine and rat tissues ( 4 , 5 ) .
Within the hematopoietic system , the expression of BLR1 is restricted to mature resting B cells and a subset of T helper memory cells ( 6 ) .
Disruption of the birJ gene in mice revealed an essential role of this receptor in directing lymphocyte migration ( 7 ) .
BirZ'~ mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess either none or a significantly reduced number of morpho-logically altered Peyer 's patches .
The migration of B cells to Peyer 's patches and splenic follicles was severely impaired in these animals , resulting in significant morphological alterations of the primary lymphoid follicles and lack of functional germinal centers .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org tiation-specific expression of genes to mature B cells have not been resolved .
Candidate transcription factors are members of the NF- « B/Rel family that includes several factors ; among these a heterodimer of p50 ( NFxB1 ) and p65 ( RelA ) is one of the prevailing forms in mammalian cells .
All members of the NF- « B family share a common amino-terminal Rel homology domain , which is required for dimerization as well as for DNA binding .
Upon induction by various stimuli , NF- « B factors activate a wide array of genes , including those involved in the early immune response ( for review see Ref .
8 ) .
The octamer consensus sequence , 5-ATGCAAAT-3 ' , was initially identified as an essential regulatory element in promoters and enhancers of the immunoglobulin genes but is also present in promoters of numerous ubiquitous genes ( for review see Ref .
9 ) .
The octamer motif is recognized by the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Oct-1 and by the B lymphocyte-restricted factor Oct-2 .
Both are highly homologous in their bipartite DNA-binding POU domain ( for review see Ref .
10 ) .
As both Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind equally well to the octamer sequence , it remains unclear whether Oct-2 specifically directs the expression of octamer-dependent genes in B lymphocytes .
Several observations suggest the existence of additional B cell-re-stricted cofactors essential for an octamer-dependent gene activation in B cells .
Recently , a novel B cell-specific coactivator of octamer binding factors termed Bobl ( OBF-L/OCA-B ) was identified and cloned from human ( 11-13 ) and murine ( 14 , 15 ) tissues .
Bob1l interacts with the POU domains of either Oct-1 or Oct-2 forming a ternary complex on DNA .
Upon the binding of Bob1 , Oct-1 is converted from an ubiquitous to a lymphocyte-specific factor and shows increased specificity of DNA binding ( 16 ) .
Although in gene-targeted mice Oct-2 is dispensable in the antigen-independent stage of B lymphocyte development , B cell maturation seems to be severely impaired in these animals ( 17 ) .
Recently , two Oct-2-regulated genes , CD36 ( 18 ) and CRISP-3 ( 19 ) , have been identified .
As their function in the immune system is not clear , there might be yet undiscovered targets of Oct-2 regulation that are relevant for B cell matura-tion .
Data presented here demonstrate that in B cells regulation of the BLR1I gene is cooperatively controlled by NF-KB , Oct-2 , and Bob1 .
The observation that the B cell homing chemokine receptor , BLR1 , is a target for Bobl and Oct-2 links these factors to the molecule with an essential function in the immune system .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Genomic Cloning-Human genomic clones were isolated from a library made from genomic DNA of the Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line BL64 in the vector EMBL3A ( 20 ) ; murine clones were isolated from 28831 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 28832 BALB/c ( CLONTECH ] ) and 1295V genomic DNA libraries ( Stratagene ) .
Primer Extension and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Re-action-Primer extension was performed by annealing 50 ug of total RNA with 1 fmol of *°P-labeled oligonucleotide primer TTGAGAGGCTCC-3 ' ( +212 to +231 bp ) `` at 42 °C .
As a size standard , the genomic 2.1-kilobase pair BamHI fragment was sequenced with the same oligonucleotide primer .
Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using total RNA isolated from Raji or ESIII cells and the oligonucleotides as follows : primer for reverse transcriptase reaction OT2 ( 5'-GGTCCATTTCCAGCGTTAGC-3 ' ) ; 3'-primer OS2 ( 5'-GGCTG-TGAGTCACCAGACTG-3 ' ) ; 5'-primer O+1 ( 5-CCGGGAAAGAAGCT-GAAATG-3 ' ) ; 5'-primer O-56 ( 5'-GGAGAAGTGAGGGCAGCCTTT-3 ' ) .
The genomic 2.l1-kilobase pair BamHI fragment was used as a positive control .
Plasmid Constructions and Site-directed Mutagenesis-The human p-1097/+215 construct was made by ligating the genomic 1.29-kilo-base pair BamHUVXbal fragment with the double-stranded Xbal-di-gested oligonucleotide ( +199 to +215 bp ) and cloning together into the BamHI and Sail site of the CAT reporter vector pGCAT-C ( 21 ) .
Using Bal-31 exonuclease a series of 5'-deletion mutants was prepared .
Murine mblrl-Luc construct was made by cloning the 0.98-kilobase pair BamHIV/Pst ] fragment from 129SV genomic DNA into the pGL2-basic luciferase reporter construct ( Promega ) .
Expression vectors , pCATCH-Bob1 ( 11 ) and pOEV1 ( 22 ) , were a gift from W. Schaffner ( Ziirich , Switzerland ) .
Plasmids ReCMVp50 and ReCMVp65 were kindly provided by P. Baeuerle ( Freiburg , Germany ) .
All mutated constructs were made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and controlled by sequencing .
Cell Culture , DNA Transfection , and Reporter Assays-B cell lines ( Raji , lymphoblastoid line IARC549 ( 20 ) , and AbV/Oct2-ER ) and Helia cells were grown at standard conditions .
Hela cells were transfected with 5-20 pug of various reporter constructs using the calcium phosphate method .
Raji and Abl/Oct2-ER cells were transfected by electro-poration ( 1070 microfarads and 250-8300 V ) .
Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed with reporter lysis buffer ( Promega ) .
The amount of expressed CAT was determined by a CAT-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Luciferase activity was determined in a LB 9501 luminometer ( Berthold ) using a luciferase assay system ( Promega ) .
All transfections were normalized to the level of total cellular protein ( Bradford assay , Bio-Rad ) and repeated at least three times .
Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays-Nuclear proteins were extracted as described previously ( 23 ) .
Peripheral blood cells depleted of BLR1l-expressing lymphocytes were isolated using a MACS separator as described before ( 6 ) .
The double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled by filling in the overhangs with Taq polymerase ( Stratagene ) in the presence of radioactive NTPs at 54 °C .
80 fmol were used per lane in electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Oligonucleotides for electrophoretic mobility shift assay had the following sequences ( top strand ) : Oct , 5-GCAGCTCATTTGCTTAAATTTC ; Oct-wt , 5 -ATTCAG-AAAGCTCATTTGCATTAAGACCAAGCTGCAAGCTTAGC ; Oct-m , 5'-ATTCAGAAAGCTCACTGATACTAAGAGGAAGCTGCAAGCTTAGC ; E-box , 5'-tegaTCTAGAGGCACCTGGCGGGGAGC .
Flow Cytometry Analysis-Lymphocytes were isolated from the spleen of mice at 4-6 weeks except for progenies of Oct-2* `` ~ mice that were isolated within 1 h after delivery .
The cells were incubated with either anti-B220-fluorescein isothiocyanate ( Caltac ) and anti-BLR1-biotin monoclonal antibodies ( 7 ) or with anti-IgM-fluorescein isothio-cyanate , B220-phycoerythrin , and anti-BLR1-biotin for 30 min at 4 °C .
After two washes , the biotinylated antibody was revealed with strepta-vidin-phycoerythrin ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) or with streptavidin-Cy-Chrome** ( Pharmingen ) staining .
The cells were subjected to the flow cytometry analysis using a FACScan flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) .

Mapping of the RNA initiation site of the human BLR1I promoter .
A , primer extension was performed with 50 ug of total Raji cells RNA hybridized to a *°P-labeled primer complementary to nucleotides +212 to +281 bp .
The precise position of the 5'-end was determined by electrophoresis of the primer extension products next to a sequence ladder derived from the same primer .
B , PCR analysis was performed with 1 ug of total Raji RNA or genomic DNA .
M , 123-bp ladder ; K1 , no reverse transcriptase was added ; K2 , no DNA was added .
tion of the start site could be confirmed by PCR analysis using primers flanking the initiation site ( Fig .
1B ) .
Only primer pair 1 ( O+1 , sequence +1 to +20 bp ) generated a PCR product on the RNA template , whereas primer pair 2 ( 0-56 , sequence -56 to -36 bp ) did not .
As a control , PCR was done on a DNA template using both primer pairs ( Fig .
1B ) .
Alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the human BLR1I promoter ( EMBL accession no .
X83755 ) and its murine counterpart ( EMBL accession no .
X83756 ) shows highly conserved regions that include consensus sequences for potential regulatory elements such as APL , LEF-1 , NF-kB , a purine-rich sequence ( Pu.box ) , a noncanonical octamer , and an E-box motif ( Fig .
2A ) .
Both promoters lack TATA and CCAAT boxes as well as initiator-like sequences ( 24 ) .
Cell Type and Differentiation Stage Specificity of BLR1 Promoter Activity-To define the sequences responsible for cell type- and differentiation-specific BLR1I expression , a series of 5'-deletion mutants of the human promoter region starting at position -1097 was linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and transfected into Raji , IARC549 , or Hela cell lines ( data not shown ) .
CAT expression driven from the BLR1 promoter was only detectable in Raji cells and not in IARC549 or Hela cells .
Similarly , a murine birl promoter cloned into the luciferase reporter vector mblrl-Lue was consistently active in Raji but not in Hela cell lines ( data not shown ) .
The minimal 5'-deletion construct p-78/+215 retained cell type-specific activity .
These results suggest that regulatory elements lying within positions -78 and +215 are sufficient to confer basal activity as well as cell type specificity of the BLR1 promoter .
To identify the regulatory motifs essential for promoter activity , we introduced a variety of mutations into the wild-type 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog Oct-2-dependent Expression of BLR1 28833 A AP1 LEF-1 Pu.box _ NF- « BI| FPR NF- « BiII Oct E-box mutation M1 ¢ §2¢ - 2 §§ f `` $ # O `` ff `` 60 Ho _ `` i TI ( = `` $ fo_ Hf `` H f * 4T human -- TreaGTCA `` ~ CCpPTGAA -*- GGGGTPPCccA -*- GAGGAA -*- cea @ rmpcee -*- GA—GGGCAGCCMT ‘ LT— GecaATTTICCc -*- TCATTTGCTT `` *- CACCTG murine -- TTGAGTCA -- CCTPTGAA -*- GGGGTPTCCCA -*- AAGGAA -- GGAGPTCCCC -*- GAGGGGCAGCCTTC -- - GGGAGTTTCCC -*- TCATTTGTTT -*- CaCGTG mutation 3 : GAccccA 2 B \ A68 , g D A\ C ( ARR CS x « S € ¢ « oC EXP 12 & i- # - > - CAT Abl/Oct2-ER CAT € CAT E g 8 © $ S E 3 4 ® 0 0 50 100 150 = = Bob1 Bob1 C relative CAT expression [ % ] E = Oct2 = Oct2 Abl/Oct2-ER o 2 no lrad relative luciferase activity 4a P o-= = = 4-OHT 4-OHT 4-O0HT =- Bob1 _ > -- - Bob1 - -_ Bob1 Bob1 = NFB _ NFkB = NFB - NFB = -- - Ocff - Oct ?

Structural and functional analyses of the human and murine BLR1I promoter .
A , sequence comparison between binding sites of different transcription factors in human BLR ] and murine birl promoters .
Changed nucleotides in the mutated constructs are indicated .
B , on the left are schematic drawings of the mutated BLRI-CAT fusion constructs .
Each mutation is indicated by a black symbol .
The wild-type p-612/+215 and mutated constructs ( 20 ug ) were transfected into Raji cells .
CAT expression was measured , and the level of p-612/+215 CAT expression was set to 100 % .
C , Oct-2- , NF- « B- , and Bobl-dependent activation of the murine birZ promoter .
20 ug of mbir-Lue plasmid or constructs m-E8 and mE8-2 with a mutated octamer sequence were transfected or cotransfected with NF- « B p50/p65 ( 5 ug each ) and Bob1 ( 10 ug ) in Abl/Oct2-ER cells .
Each transfection was split in half , and 4-O0HT was added to one part of the final concentration of 1 uM where indicated .
Activity of mblrl-Lue , m-E8 , or mE8-2 alone was set to 1 in all experiments , and the other bars present data of six independent experiments as -fold activation of luciferase activity above that .
D , cotransfection of 20 ug of mblr-Lue with 10 ug of pOEV1 , 10 ug of pCATCH-Bob1 , or with both vectors into Abl/Oct2-ER cells .
£ , activation of the bir1 promoter in Helia cells .
mbirl-Lue ( 10 ug ) was cotransfected with 5-10 ug of constructs expressing transcription factors Oct-2 , NF- « B , and Bob1 .
Luciferase activity observed with mbirl-Lue was set to 1. construct p-612/+215 .
Each mutation destroyed a single consensus sequence for a putative regulatory element .
Among all tested mutations , only three dramatically decreased the level of CAT expression in Raji cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
All of them lie within the region identified as essential for promoter activity and specificity ( -78 to +215 ) .
Mutation B6 reduced promoter activity by 80 % .
However , we could not specify the proteins binding to this site and named it a `` functional promoter region `` ( FPR ) , implying that it may serve as a functional substitution for the TATA box within the BLRI promoter .
Mutation of the NF- « Byj binding site ( Fig .
2B , pN7 ) caused a decrease of the promoter activity by 60 % .
Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , we could detect binding of proteins of the NF- « B/rel family to this site ( data not shown ) .
Mutation of the noncanonical octamer site ( Fig .
2B , pES8 ) reduced promoter activity by more than 90 % .
To clarify the role of factors binding the octamer site , we analyzed the expression of luciferase driven by the murine bir1 promoter in the Oct-2 conditional AbVOct2-ER cell line .
This murine pre-B cell line is characterized by a homozygous mutation of the endogenous oct-2 gene and is stably transformed with a construct coding for a chimera between Oct-2 and the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor ( 25 ) .
In this line transfected with mblrl-Luc , consistently less than 10 % of luciferase activity could be detected compared with the cells with endogenously expressed birl ( data not shown ) .
Treatment with 4-OHT induces functional activation of Oct-2 but excludes the transactivation by the hormone-binding domain present in the Oct2-ER fusion protein ( 19 ) .
Addition of 4-OHT to the transfected cells resulted in an over 5-fold activation of the bir1 promoter ( Fig .
2C ) .
In parallel , the expression of luciferase from two constructs with different mutations of the octamer site was barely detectable and could not be stimulated by 4-OHT treatment ( Fig .
2 , A and C ) .
We further tested the contribution of NF- « B p50 and p65 subunits as well as of Bob1 to the activation of the birl promoter .
Both the wild-type vector as well as the mutated counterpart m-E8 could be activated when cotransfected with vectors expressing NF- « B , al 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 28834 though the levels of activation differed and increased 8- and 4-fold , respectively .
However , the other mutated construct , m-E8-2 , did not respond to NF- « B and remained completely inactive .
Bob1l could only very slightly add to the activation by NF- « B alone , but the combinatory action of Bobl and NF- « B complemented with the induction of Oct-2 by 4-OHT produced an over 45-fold activation of the promoter .
In both cases , neither of the mutated vectors showed any response .
The construct , m-E8 , bears a single nucleotide substitution at position 5 within the octamer sequence .
As reported recently , this substitution still permits very weak residual binding activity to the resulting site ( 26 ) .
However , 4 of 8 nucleotides are substituted in mutation m-E8-2 , thus completely eliminating any binding to this region .
In our experiments , the oligonucleotide corresponding to mutation m-E8 was able to weakly compete for Oct-1 and Oct-2 binding to the octamer sequence from the birl promoter , whereas the oligonucleotide corresponding to mutation m-E8-2 did not compete under the same conditions ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , little residual activity of Oct-1 possibly binding to the mutation m-E8 could allow moderate activation by NF- « B .
However , introduction of a severe mutation into the octamer site completely destroys the activity of the promoter and also prevents activation by any other factors .
Similarly to the induction of Oct-2 by 4-OHT , transient expression of Oct-2 resulted in 4-fold activation of the birJ promoter ( Fig .
2D ) .
The same level of induction was mediated by Bob1 alone suggesting that the ternary complex of Bobl and the ubiquitous factor Oct-1 can substitute for Oct-2 in AbVOct2-ER cells .
However , the strongest activation ( approximately 9-fold ) is produced by a combination of both Bobl and Oct-2 ( Fig .
2D ) .
As mentioned above , no expression of the reporter gene was detected in nonlymphoid cells .
We tested whether the birl promoter exerts activity in the Hela cell line upon ectopical expression of Oct-2A , NF -B , and Bob1 ( Fig .
25 ) .
Neither of the latter factors could strongly activate the reporter expression on its own .
However , significant transactivation patterns were mediated by various combinations of NF- « B , Oct-2A , or Bob1l .
The most striking induction was achieved with all three factors together .
Even in this case , however , the level of reporter expression was still much lower than that in lymphoid cells ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , additional unidentified B cell-specific activators seem to be required for full promoter function .
Binding of Oct-2 Correlates with the Expression of BLRI-As shown above , the octamer motif plays a crucial role in the expression of the BLR1I gene .
We examined the binding of the Oct proteins to the noncanonical octamer site .
Incubation of an oligonucleotide probe with Raji nuclear extracts produced several octamer-specific nucleoprotein complexes ( Fig .
3 , lane 1 ) .
These complexes were formed by the octamer binding factor Oct-1 and two alternatively spliced variants of Oct-2 , Oct-2A and Oct-2B , and could be specifically competed ( Fig .
3 , lanes 2-9 ) .
We also tested nuclear extracts from lymphoblastoid IARC549 B cells , peripheral blood lymphocytes negative for BLR1 expression ( PBL® `` `` *'~ ) , and nonlymphoid Hela cells ( Fig .
3 , lanes 10-12 ) .
The binding of Oct-2A and Oct-2B was very low in lymphoblastoid IARC549 B cells , which represent an activated stage and do not express BLR1 , and was absent in PBL ® and HeLa cells .
Other nucleoproteins , which bind to the determined consensus sequences within the BLR1I promoter , showed no differences in their DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from Raji or IARC549 cells ( data not shown ) .
BLR1 Expression Is Highly Reduced in Lymphatic Organs of Oct-2 , Bob-1 , and p50/p52 Knockout Mice-We were interested in testing whether the expression of birl would be affected in mice deficient for Oct-2 .

Specific binding of octamer binding factors to the noncanonical octamer site within the BLR1I promoter .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the octamer binding site from +152 to +178 and 2-ug nuclear extracts prepared from Raji cells , IARC549 , peripheral BLR1-nonexpressing blood lymphocytes ( PBL® `` `` * `` ~ ) , and HeLa cells .

The expression of BLR1 in spleen lymphocytes from newborn progeny of Oct-2'~- mice was analyzed by flow cytometry .
BLR1 expression was only barely detectable on B220 positive cells from null mutant mice , whereas cells isolated from wild-type littermates expressed levels of BLR1 usually observed in newborns ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) .
As the in vitro data suggest that the bir1 promoter is fully active only in the presence of Bobl and NF- « B , we further tested the expression of BLR1 in mice deficient for these factors .
Expression of BLR1 in B220 * cells derived from lymph nodes or spleen was unaffected both in wild-type and heterozy-gous animals ; however , it was more than 50 % reduced in Bob1l null mutant mice ( Fig .
4C , data shown for lymph nodes only ) .
Furthermore , expression of BLR1 was virtually absent in mice lacking both p50 and p52 NF- « B proteins ( Fig .
4D ) .
Interest-ingly , mice lacking p52 only showed regular levels of BLRL .
DISCUSSION We isolated and characterized the promoter for the BLR1I gene .
BLR1 transcription initiation starts at a single site , but the promoter sequence lacks classical features like a TATA box or an initiator-like sequence .
The core promoter sequence required for basic and tissue-specific expression was found to reside in a fragment encompassing a region from position -78 to +215 with respect to the transcriptional start site .
By mu-tational analysis , it was found that this fragment harbors three regions essential for promoter activity : 1 ) a site termed FPR located at position -36 , which suggests that it may be important for the formation of the preinitiation complex ; 2 ) a NF-kB site ; and 3 ) a noncanonical octamer sequence .
The latter is the key determinant for BLR1I promoter activity , because a mutation abrogating binding of Oct factors resulted in a complete promoter inactivation .

« B , Bobl , and Oct-2 factors act in a synergistic fashion to regulate BLR1I promoter activity ( see Fig .
2 ) .
It was reported that the binding of NF-kB p50/p65 subunits to DNA introduces a bend into the DNA molecule ( 27 ) .
Taking into consideration the location of the essential binding sites for NF-kB , Oct , and the FPR in BLR ] 1I promoter , it is tempting to speculate that this NF- « B-mediated DNA bending brings FPR and the octamer element into close proximity to each other .
This would enable the interaction of octamer-bound factors to the protein ( s ) bound to FPR .
The importance of this interaction is substantiated by the evidence that Oct-2 may facilitate the formation of the preinitiation complex ( 28 ) .
Furthermore , Oct-2 can interact with the TATA box-binding protein TBP ( 29 ) .
The described regulation of the BLR1I promoter activity is the first example for the cooperative regulation via NF- « B and octamer binding factors from a position downstream of the transcriptional start site .
We demonstrated that the B cell-specific coactivator Bobl potentiates Oct-2-mediated activation of the birl promoter .
Bob1 has its own activation domain ( 11 ) , but the mechanism of activation is not fully understood .
It is suggested that Bob1l acts as a bridge , connecting the octamer-bound transcription factor to components of the TFIID complex ( 12 ) .
Therefore , this interaction may also contribute to the regulation of the BLR1I promoter function .
The ternary complex of Bobl with octamer factors shows higher selectivity in recognition of the octamer sequences , as Oct-1 or Oct-2 alone ( 16 ) .
The octamer site in the BLR1I promoter is a noncanonical motif , with a substitution T/A in the second position in the human promoter accompanied in the murine counterpart by an additional substitution G/A in the third position .
It was shown that the fifth base in the octamer 28835 site is most critical for the formation of the ternary complex , and it should be occupied by adenosine ( 16 ) .
It was suggested that the first three nucleotides of the octamer sequence are also involved in the recognition of the octamer sequence .
However , our data indicate that the birZ promoter is activated by Bob1 , implying that within the context of this gene the second and the third bases of the octamer motif are not necessarily required for the activation .
Analysis of mice with targeted deletion of Oct-2 , Bob1 , or NF- « B provides further evidence for the critical requirement of these factors for the expression of BLR1I .
Like Oct-2-deficient mice , Bobl knockout mice ( 30-82 ) show unaffected immunoglobulin gene expression but have severely reduced numbers of mature B cells and lower levels of secondary antibody isotypes in serum .
Most important is the observation that Bobl '- mice completely fail to develop germinal centers following immunization with thymus-dependent antigen .
The same phenotype is shared by mice with the targeted disruption of p52/NF- « B2 ( 33 , 34 ) and with double knockout of p50/p52 genes ( 85 ) .
Adoptively transferred p52-deficient lymphocytes can form germinal centers ( 33 , 34 ) , and consistent with this observation , we detected unaffected expression of BLR1 on these cells .
In p50/p52 double knockout mice development of B cells is halted at stage B220 `` ° `` , IgM* , CD23~ .
Cells with this phenotype are also found in normal spleens , although at low frequency .
In wild-type animals , these cells express BLR1 at the same level as observed for mature B cells , `` but we could not detect BLR1 on corresponding cells derived from double knockout mice .
The absence of germinal centers is also a hallmark of the phenotype of birl-deficient mice .
Following a T cell-dependent antigenic challenge , B cells become activated but fail to migrate into B cell follicles of the spleen .
As a consequence , germinal centers do not develop ( 7 ) .
Thus , the severely reduced expression of BLR1 in both Bobl and p50/p52 null mice may contribute to the absence of germinal center reactions in these animals as a consequence of impaired B lymphocyte migration .
