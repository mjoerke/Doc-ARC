The transcription factor Pax-5 is a key regulator of B cell development .
Pax-5a/B cell-specific activator protein and an alternatively spliced isoform , Pax-5d , may have opposing functions in transcriptional regulation due to the lack of a transactivation domain in Pax-5d .
To study B cell-specific changes that occur during the aging process , we investigated expression patterns of Pax-5a and 5d in mature B cells of young and aged mice .
RNase protection assays showed a similar transcriptional pattern for both age groups that indicates that aging has no affect on transcription initiation or alternative splicing for either isoform .
In contrast , a significant reduction in the DNA binding activity of Pax-S5a but not Pax-5d protein was observed in aged B cells in vitro , while Western blot analyses showed that similar levels of Pax-5a and 5d proteins were present in both age groups .
The observed decrease in Pax-S5a binding activity correlated with changes in expression of two Pax-5 target genes in aged B cells .
Expression of the Ig J chain and the secreted form of Ig p , which are both known to be suppressed by Pax-5a in mature B cells , were increased in B cells of aged mice .
Together , our studies suggest that changes associated with the aging phenotype cause posttranslational modification ( s ) of Pax-S5a but not Pax-5d , which may lead to an abnormal B cell phenotype in aged mice , associated with elevated levels of J chain , and secretion of IgM .

The impaired immune responses of aged organisms to vaccines and the greater susceptibility to infections are the result of changes in both cell-mediated and humoral response pathways .
Because of the central role T cells play in cell-mediated immune responses , thymic involution has generally been viewed as the primary regulator event in immune senescence ( 1 ) .
Decreased numbers of naive CD4* T cells and reduced proliferation responses in aged rodents and humans result from a decreased ability of CD4* T cells to secrete cytokines , most notably IL-2 ( 2 , 3 ) .
Significant and intrinsic changes of the humoral immune response have been observed in aging rodents and humans .
Aged mice show a shift in Ab repertoire from non-self- to self-recogni-tion , and from high to low affinities ( 4 , 5 ) .
Additionally , a decrease in class switching may explain the observed shift of Ig Abs from the IgG to IgM isotype ( 4 ) , although this result has not been independently verified ( 6 , 7 ) .
An increased number of B cells that spontaneously secrete Igs has also been observed ( 8 ) .

One approach to studying the changes that take place in aging B lymphocytes is to examine expression patterns and functions of B cell-specific transcription factors .
We have focused on the transcription factor Pax-5 , a member of the paired-box gene family of transcription factors ( 9-11 ) .
In adult mice , Pax-5 expression is limited to testis and developing B lymphocytes ( 11 ) .
Within the B cell lineage , Pax-5 is expressed in progenitor , precursor , and mature B cells , but expression is down-regulated in plasma cells ( 9 , 10 ) .
Pax-5 has been deleted in mice through targeted gene disruption and its absence in B cells from homozygous mutant mice results in a complete block in early B cell development , at the late pro-B cell stage ( 12 ) .
Pax-5 or B cell specific activator protein ( BSAP ) ® is now considered a `` master regulator `` of B cell development , as it plays a central role in both the developmental and activation pathways of these cells ( 10 , 13 , 14 ) .
Several studies suggest that Pax-5 is involved in B cell proliferation , but the exact mechanism is not well understood ( 14 , 15 ) .
Putative B cell-specific target genes for Pax-5 include Lambda 5 , CD19 , mb-1 , blk , RAG-2 , J-chain , and IgH genes ( 15-23 ) .
Of those , Lambda 5 , CD19 , mb-1 , IgH , and blk products are involved in activation and/or signaling events through the ( pre- ) B cell receptor .
The J chain forms pentamer structures with secreted IgM molecules in activated B cells and plasma cells ( 24 ) .
RAG-2 is first transcribed in progenitor B and precursor B cells , but reexpression has also been observed in immature B cells expressing an autoreactive B cell receptor , leading to receptor ed-iting , and in germinal center B cells during immune responses ( 25 , 26 ) .
Pax-5 also interacts with 3 ' a enhancers and switch regions of IgH genes and is likely to affect both the amount and the isotype of secreted Ig ( 15 , 22 , 23 , 27-29 ) .
Depending on the target gene ° Abbreviations used in this paper : BSAP , B cell-specific activator protein ; SRB , small resting ( mature ) B cells ; PAB , partially activated B cells ; ivt , in vitro translated ; wt , wild type ; mut , mutant ; ROS , reactive oxygen species .

In addition to the full-length Pax-5 @ ( BSAP ) isoform , mouse Pax-5 transcripts can generate at least three additional splice vari-ants , named Pax-5b , 5d , and Se ( 30 ) .
In resting , splenic B cells , the protein level of Pax-5b is very low ( M. Lowen and P. Zwollo , unpublished observations ) and Pax-5e is not present at detectable levels ( 30 ) .
In contrast , isoform Pax-5d is expressed at readily detectable levels in resting B cells and is of particular interest because the C-terminal region , which in Pax-5a contains the trans-activation , repression , and partial homeodomain homology re-gions , has been replaced by a novel sequence with unknown function ( 30 ) .
Based on the absence of a transactivating domain , we hypothesize that Pax-5d may have a regulatory function opposite that of Pax-5a and that relative levels of these two isoforms in the nucleus may , at least in part , determine their regulatory activities on target genes .
Given the potential involvement of Pax-5a in cell proliferation , Ig production , and isotype switching , changes in Pax-5 expression are likely to affect humoral immune responses and B cell function in aging animals .
The goals of this study were to compare the expression levels and DNA binding activities of Pax 5a and 5d in splenic B cell populations from young and aged mice and to determine whether levels correlated with the expression pattern of specific Pax-5 target genes .
Pax-5a and 5d expression were determined both at the RNA and protein level in splenic , resting B cell populations .
RNA transcript levels of both isoforms were shown to be unchanged in resting B cells of aged mice ( 18-23 mo old ) .
In contrast , the amount of Pax-5a able to interact with specific DNA binding sites in vitro had decreased significantly in aged B cells , and this correlated with a relative increase in DNA binding activity of Pax-5d .
Furthermore , Western blot analysis indicated that the protein levels of both isoforms remain constant as animals age .
Lastly , the reduced Pax-5a DNA binding activity in aged B cells correlated with increased expression of two target genes that are normally repressed during this stage of development , namely the J chain gene and the Igq gene .
Materials and Methods Animals Aged BALB/c mice 17-23 mo in age were obtained from the National Institute on Aging colony at Harlan Sprague-Dawley ( Indianapolis , IN ) .
Additional BALB/c mice between the ages of 12 and 23 mo were obtained from our own colonies .
Young BALB/c mice 2-4 mo in age were either purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley or used from our own colonies .
An outbred population of Peromyscus leucopus ( white-footed mouse ) with animals between 3-4 mo and 27-31 mo were a gift from Dr. Paul Heide-man 's colonies at the population laboratories at The College of William and Mary .
Generation of mAbs to isoform Pax-5d Synthetic peptide 5d/e ( residues 218-235 of the Pax-5d protein ; see Ref .
30 ) was synthesized at the peptide facility in the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology at The University of California at Berkeley .
Peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) .
Conjugate was dissolved in saline and emulsified with CFA .
Next , 100 ug of Ag was injected i.p .
and s.c. into BALB/c mice followed by a booster shot of the same Ag in saline both i.p .
and s.c. after 6 wk .
Four days after the booster shot , mice were sacrificed and spleens removed for the fusion with myeloma cell line NSO ( 31 ) .
Spleen cells were washed and RBC removed by lysis in 0.17 M ice-cold NH , Cl for 10 min on ice .
Myeloma cells and spleen cells were then mixed at a 1:4 ratio followed by drop-wise addition of 50 % polyethylene glycol ( Hybrimax ; Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) to induce cell fusion .
Cells were plated on 96-well plates at 5 X 10° cells/well in DMEM containing 20 % FBS ( BioWhittaker , Walkersville , MD ) , 2 mM glutamine , 50 U/ml penicillin , 50 ug/ml streptomycin , and 50 wM 2-ME containing hypoxan-thine , aminopterin , and thymidine and incubated at 37°C with 5 % CO ; .
REDUCED PAX-5A ACTIVITY IN AGED MICE Cell supernatants were tested by ELISA using Pax-5d peptide conjugated to BSA .
A total of 28 strongly positive clones were cloned by limiting dilution and supernatants tested by ELISA and Western blot analysis .
Ascites fluid was produced by i.p .
injection of BALB/c mice with hybridoma cell suspensions using 1.5 X 10 `` cells per injection , filter sterilized , and stored as frozen aliquots at -80°C .
Isolation of cell fractions and preparation of nuclear extracts Teased spleen cell suspensions from BALB/c mice were collected through a 40-um nylon cell strainer in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FCS ( BioWhittaker ) , 2 mM glutamine , 50 U/ml penicillin , 50 ug/ml streptomycin , and 50 M 2-ME , washed , and resuspended in HBSS .
Percoll gradients ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) were used to isolate small resting , ( mature ) B cells ( SRBs ) : five different Percoll densities ( 70 , 66 , 63 , 60 , and 50 % ) were layered to maximize the isolation of pure resting cell populations ( on the 70 % layer ) away from activated B cells and plasma cells ( on the 50 % layer ) .
Similarly , partially activated B cells ( PABs ) were collected from the 66 % Percoll layer in this system .
The 70 % Percoll-purified cell populations contain ~25 % resting T cells as determined by flow cytometry , but because complement lysis reactions with anti-Thy.1 , anti-CD4 , and anti-CD8 to remove T cell populations resulted in partial activation of the SRBs , this step was omitted from our protocol .
Comparison of 70 % cell fractions from young and aged mice by flow cytometric analyses using anti-CD3 and anti-B220 Abs showed that the ratio of B and T cells is the same for each age group ( P. Zwollo and Y. Deng , unpublished observations ) .
The preparation of nuclear extracts is described elsewhere ( 32 ) .
The entire procedure for the generation of nuclear extracts was performed in a cold room at 6°C .
Transient transfections COS-1 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS , 2 mM glutamine , 50 U/ml penicillin , and 50 pg/ml !
streptomycin .
One microgram of the expression constructs pcDNA.5d or pcDNA.S5a ( 32 ) were transfected using Lipofectamine ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) according to the supplier 's instructions .
After 40 h incubation , cells were collected and nuclear extracts were prepared following a standard protocol described elsewhere ( 32 ) .
Western blot analysis Nuclear extracts from SRBs were separated on 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-Cl , 0.2 M glycine , and 3.5 mM SDS .
Equal amounts of nuclear protein were used in each sample as determined by Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) .
Samples were elec-trophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose filters ( Schleicher and Schuell , Keene , NH ) in a buffer containing 48 mM Tris-Cl , 39 mM glycine , 1.3 mM SDS , and 20 % methanol .
For experiments using whole-cell ly-sates , B cells were purified from 70 % layers of Percoll gradients and washed in PBS .
Then 3 X 10° cells were lysed in sample buffer and boiled for 5 min and loaded onto a 12 % SDS-PAGE gel .
Membranes were incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution of PBS and 5 % nonfat milk , followed by a 1- to 2-h incubation with a primary Ab diluted in blocking solution .
Next , membranes were washed three times for 10 min in PBS , followed by a 1- to 2-h incubation with a secondary , HRP-conjugated Ab .
Following three 10-min washes in PBS , filters were developed with an ECL kit ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , and bands were visualized on Eastman Kodak XARS5 film ( Rochester , NY ) .
Antibodies ED-1 , a polyclonal rabbit antiserum ( 32 ) that recognizes the paired domain sequence of Pax-5 , was used at 32 pg/ml .
Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the transcription factor TFIID ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) was used at 2.5 pg/ml .
Goat polyclonal anti-Pax-5 antiserum N-19 ( against aa 2-20 of Pax-5a ) was used at 3 pg/ml ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Goat polyclonal NF- « B/p50 Ab was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at 0.2 pg/ml .
Ascites fluid or cell supernatants containing the 6G11 mouse anti-Pax-5d/e mAb prepared in this laboratory was used at 34 ug/tol and detected using a HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary Ab ( Zymed , South San Francisco , CA ) at a 4.8 pg/ml .
Rabbit polyclonal anti-J chain serum ( a gift from Dr. Marian Koshland , University of California , Berkeley , CA ) was used at a 28 ug/ml .
The ED-1 , TFIID , and J chain Abs were detected with a HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary Ab ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) at 2.8 ug/ml .
NF-B/p50 and Pax-5/N-19 Abs were detected using a rabbit anti-goat IgG at 0.67 ug/ml ( Zymed ) .

Binding assays were conducted for 20 min at 30°C in reactions containing 60 mM KCI , 12 mM HEPES , pH 7.9 , 4 mM Tris-Cl , pH 7.9 , 1 mM EDTA , 0.33 mM DTT , 300 ng BSA , 12 % glycerol , 1-2 ug poly ( dI + dC ) , and 0.5-1 ug nuclear extract ( 33 ) , and 0.1 ng double-stranded oligonucleotide CD19/BSAP DNA ( 5-CAG ACA CCC ATG GTT GAG TGC CCT CCA G-3 ' ) labeled with [ ~-*P ] dCTP .
The ds.mutCD19 oligonucleotide had a mutated Pax-5 binding site and was used for competition EMSAs ( mutations are underlined ) : 5'-CTA GGA CAC CGG TGG TTT AGT GCC CTC C-3 ' .
The ratio of nuclear extract to poly ( dI + dC ) ( in micrograms ) was kept constant at 2:1 in all experi-ments .
Competition or supershift EMSAs containing Ab were preincubated in the presence of 1 gl ( 1:5 diluted ) Ab without probe for 10 min at 30°C .
Products were separated by electrophoresis through a 5 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel ( 29:1 , acrylamide to bisacrylamide ) in buffer containing 33 mM Tris-Cl , 33 mM boric acid , and 0.74 mM EDTA .
Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XARS film .
In vitro transcription and translation of Pax-5 isoforms The plasmids ( pBluescript ; Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) containing the isoform Pax-5a ( pBS.1.2 ) or 5d ( pBS.10.1 ) were transcribed in sense direction with T3 RNA polymerase as described previously ( 30 ) .
Translation was conducted using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( TnT ; Promega , Madison , WI ) according to the suppliers ' directions .
RNA isolation and RNase protection assay Total cellular RNA was isolated from Percoll-purified SRBs using a RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
From each spleen , ~0.5-1 X 10 `` resting lymphocytes could be purified from the 70 % Percoll layer for RNA processing .
The yields of the RNA extractions from SRBs were very low , ~2-4 ug RNA per spleen .
Because multiple experiments needed to be performed on these RNAs to confirm obtained results , RNA from two to four mice was pooled for some samples .
Antisense radiolabeled RNA probes were prepared as described ( 30 ) .
The 392-nt RNA probe p10.1 ( 30 ) protects nt 447-607 of Pax-5 sequence resulting in a 160-nt fragment , as well as nt 447-735 of Pax-5d/e resulting in a 288-nt protected fragment .
A B-tubulin-specific probe was synthesized from the BamHI-linearized form of plasmid pp.100 , which contains nt 170-263 of the murine B-tubulin gene .
The pp.100 RNA probe is 152 nt and protects a 94-nt tubulin RNA fragment .
RNase protection assays were performed as described ( 30 ) but only 1-5 ug of total cellular RNA was used .
The two probes were incubated simultaneously with each RNA sample to obtain an optimal internal control .
The template for p ( M & S ) was generated using PCR amplification with sense primer cu4.F ( 5'-cegaattcACTGTGACAGAGGAGGAATGG ; lower case is the EcoRI restriction site with flanking sequence ) targeting exon cu4 and antisense primer mIgM.B ( 5S'cgggateccAAGCTGGAGGGC AACACAGGAAAG ; lower case represents the BamHI restriction site with flanking sequence ) complementary to exon M2 of the Igu gene ( 34 ) .
As the PCR target , a spleen cDNA library was used , which resulted in amplification of the membrane form of IgH containing exon cu4 , M1 , and M2 sequence without the S segment at the 3 ' side of cu4 ( 34 ) .
The 251-nt PCR-amplified fragment was cloned into EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of pBluescript , and the DNA sequence was verified using dideoxy sequencing .
The p ( M & S ) riboprobe was used to detect both a 251-nt membrane sequence of the IgH pu-chain ( exon cu4-S , M1 , and M2 sequence ) and a 111-nt sequence representing the CpA4-S fragment only , indicative of the secreted form of the H chain ( see Fig .
24 and Ref .
34 ) .
Results Generation of mAbs specific to isoform Pax-5d Pax-5d/e-specific mAbs were generated to provide a tool to unequivocally identify the Pax-5d protein by gel electrophoresis , distinguishable from Pax-5a proteolytic degradation products .
Using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis , we determined that the mAb 6G11 ( see Materials and Methods ) had the required specificity to recognize the 35-kDa Pax-5d protein , as shown in Fig .
1 .

Ivt Pax-5d runs at ~35 kDa on the gel .
To verify the presence and location of both Pax-5a and 5d proteins , the same filter as used in Fig .

1B ) .
This experiment showed that 6G11 and ED-1 recognize the same 35-kDa protein that corresponds with ivt Pax-5d ( lane 2 in Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
Using similar methods , the specificity of the 6G11 mAb was further tested on nuclear extracts derived from SRBs .
Fig .
1A ( lane 3 ) shows that 6G11 was able to recognize a 35-kDa band in SRBs , which migrates at the same position in the gel as ivt Pax-5d protein .
This result provided the first evidence that Pax-5d protein is present ( at readily detectable levels ) in nuclear extracts from resting B cells .
The mAb also detected a lower molecular mass band of ~27 kDa ( Fig .
1A , lane 3 ) , which could represent either a degradation product of Pax-5d , a modified form of Pax-5d , or a cross-reactive band .
Given its position in the gel , the 27-kDa band seemed unlikely to represent Pax-5e .
The 27-kDa band is also detectable in mature B cell lines but not plasma cell lines ( M. Lowen and P. Zwollo , unpublished observations ) .
Two bands in the 35-kDa range were detected in SRB using the Ab ED-1 ( Fig .
1B , lane 3 ) .
Of those two , the position of the lower band corresponds to Pax-5d , whereas the top band may represent a degradation product of Pax-5a containing a paired domain sequence .
To confirm that 6G11 recognizes Pax-5d specifically , we performed Western blots on nuclear extracts from COS-1 ( Fig .
1C ) that had been transfected with the Pax-5d expression construct peDNA.5d ( 32 ) .
Results in Fig .
1C show that both the 35-kDa and 27-kDa band are detected in COS cells transfected with pcDNA¥.5d ( lane 2 ) , but not in mock-transfected COS-1 cells ( Zane 3 ) , showing that their presence is dependent upon expression of the Pax-5d 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 2620 effector construct .
The anti-TFIID antiserum that detects the basal transcription factor TFIID was used to verify that equal amounts of nuclear protein were present in both the COS-1 samples ( Fig .
1C , lower panel ) .
Transcript levels of Pax-5a and 5d are unchanged in aged mice To investigate whether levels of Pax-5a or Pax-5d RNA transcripts change in aged mice , RNase protection assays were performed on 1-5 ug of total RNA extracted from SRBs of young and aged mice .
The yields of the RNA extractions from SRBs were very low ( 2-4 ug RNA per spleen ) , and RNA from multiple mice was pooled for some of the samples .
Anti-sense RNA probes were used to analyze the levels of Pax-5 isoform transcripts .
Probe 10.1 ( Fig .
24 ) detects both Pax-5a/b and Pax-5d/e sequence ( 30 ) , whereas a `` control `` tubulin probe , pp.100 , was used to detect levels and quality of each RNA sample .
Both probes were incubated simultaneously in the presence of RNA , to ensure a proper internal control .
A representative experiment is shown in Fig .
2B .
Four additional independent samples ( 1-4 spleens each ) were analyzed for each age group ( data not pBS-10.1 FIGURE 2 .

A 160-nt sized band , corresponding to isoform ( and 5b ) , and a 288-nt band , which detects Pax-5d ( and Se ) tran-scripts , were detected in all mice .
Both young and aged mice had similar relative amounts of the two isoforms , with Pax-5a levels being ~10 times more intense than Pax-5d in both aged groups .
The level and ratio of the two isoforms was also similar to those observed in a number of B cells lines and spleen tissue as reported earlier ( 30 ) .
As had been established earlier ( 30 ) , levels of Pax-5b and 5e are very low in B cell lines and splenic tissue , thus the 160-and 288-nt bands represent Pax-S5a and 5d , respectively .
Together , the data suggest that there are no changes in transcription initiation or alternative splicing of Pax-5a and 5d in mature , resting B cells as animals age .
DNA binding activity of Pax-5a is decreased in B cells of aged mice Next , we sought to test whether there was an age-associated change in the DNA binding activity of isoforms Pax-Sa and 5d .

To unambiguously demonstrate that the observed pro-tein-DNA complexes were Pax-5 specific , we performed competition EMSAs with excess double-stranded oligonucleotides containing wild-type ( wtCD19 ) or mutant ( mutCD19 ) Pax-5 binding sites using SRB nuclear extract from a young mouse .
Results of this experiment showed that the complexes on the CD19 probe are Pax-5 specific , as excess wt unlabeled probe competed efficiently for binding , but mutated probe did not , as shown in Fig .
34 .
Addition of the anti-paired domain antiserum ED-1 in Ab competition shifts resulted in removal of all complexes , confirming that all contained Pax-5 protein ( Fig .
34 ) .
Of interest , it was observed that ivt Pax-5d forms a much weaker complex as compared with ivt Pax-5a ( Fig .
3A , lane 2 ) , although Western blots ( e.g .
, Fig .
1B ) indicated that similar amounts of each Pax-5 isoform protein were present in samples .
This may be the result of differential redox regulation or protein degradation of ivt Pax-5d during the EMSA incubation ( M. Lowen and P. Zwollo , unpublished observations ) .
The mAb 6G11 could not be used for EMSAs as it did not recognize the native conformation of Pax-5d efficiently .
To identify among the multiple Pax-5 complexes those that contained Pax-5d and Pax-5a species , we combined nuclear extract from young SRBs with increasing amounts of ivt Pax-5a or Pax-5d .
A dose-dependent increase in intensity was observed for a single band corresponding to Pax-5a ( Fig .
3B , lanes 3 and 4 ) and Pax-5d ( Fig .
3B , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
When more Pax-5d was present , reduced amounts of Pax-5a bound to DNA ( Fig .
3B , lane 2 compared with lanes 5 and 6 ) , suggesting that Pax-5d replaced Pax-5a on DNA in a dose-dependent manner .
No dose-dependent increase of lower molecular mass Pax-5a degradation products was detected ( Fig .
3B , lanes 2-4 ) .
Lastly , two Pax-5a complexes were detected , named 5a.1 ( slower ) and 5a.2 ( faster ) .
Ivt Pax-5a protein runs in the slower migrating ( 5a.1 ) position on the gel ( Fig .
3B ) .
Both 5a.1 and 5a.2 complexes contained Pax-5a protein , as they were recognized by both a N-terminal-specific anti-Pax-5 Ab N-19 and paired domain Ab ED-1 ( results not shown ) .
Once specific Pax-5d- and Sa-containing complexes had been defined , nuclear extracts from SRB of young ( 2-4 mo ) and aged ( 18-22 mo ) mice were compared using EMSAs .
A representative experiment is shown in Fig .
44 .
Results showed significant decreases in the amount of Pax-5a protein bound to the CD19/Pax-5 probe in aged mice , as compared with young mice .
While both the Sa.l1 ( slower ) and 5a.2 ( faster ) complexes were detected in the young mice , aged mice possessed only complex 5a.2 , and at somewhat diminished levels as compared with young samples .

This pattern was similar to the control experiment in Fig .
3B , which showed that an increase of Pax-5d binding correlated with decreased binding of Pax-5a ( Fig .
3B , compare lanes 2 and 6 ) .
A second , faster migrating band below Pax-5d may represent a degradation product of Pax-5a or 5d , as determined by competition shift using an anti-paired domain Ab ( not shown ) .
Eight additional mice of various ages were similarly analyzed by EMSA , and combined EMSA data of 14 mice were quantified using the NIH Image software analysis program ( www : http : //rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/ ) .
This analysis showed that the ratio of bound Pax-5d to 5a consistently increased as mice age , as shown in Fig .
4B ( the Pax-5a value in this analysis represents the total of 5a.1 and 5a.2 in each sample ) .
To test whether a temperature-sensitive mechanism ( involving an enzymatic activity ) had caused the decreased DNA binding activity of Pax-5a in aged mice , SRB nuclear extracts from both age groups were preincubated for 15 min at 30°C in the absence of probe , before the EMSA .
The results from this experiment ( Fig .
4C ) showed that under such conditions complex 5a.1 disappeared in both age groups , and that only young mice retained the 5a.2 complex .
The effect of preincubation on Pax-5d levels was not as dramatic , but also resulted in a decrease in intensity of the Pax-5d complex in both age groups .
An increased amount of Pax-5 degradation products as compared with Fig .
44 is evident in both age groups under those conditions .
To further compare Pax-5 banding patterns as a function of preincubation at 30°C , we exposed SRB nuclear extracts from young mice to 30°C temperatures for 5 , 10 , or 45 min before the EMSA ( Fig .
4D ) .
Importantly , the 5a.1 complex disappears more quickly as compared with the 5a.2 complex during the preincubation , suggesting either that 5a.1 represents a more labile protein conformation or , alternatively , that the 5a.2 complex has a protein conformation with higher affinity for DNA .
( Fig .
4 , C and D ) .
Interestingly , the Pax-5a pattern in young mice after prolonged incubation at 30°C is similar to the pattern of aged mice before preincubation , including a relative decrease in the amount of Pax-5a.1 complex relative to 5a.2 .
Furthermore , the Pax-5d DNA binding activity in young mice also decreased with prolonged exposure to 30°C ( Fig .
4D ) , and this was different from the Pax-5d pattern in aged mice , which showed a relative increase of Pax-5d binding ( Fig .
4A ) .
Together , the EMSA data suggests that the observed decrease in DNA binding activity of Pax-5a with age may be the result of an unknown differential enzymatic activity , possibly pro-tease or redox regulated .

Sa To determine whether the observed change in DNA binding activity of Pax-5a was conserved in other species , we performed similar experiments on SRBs of an outbred mouse strain , P. leucopus ( white-footed mouse ) .
Because of the highly conserved nature of the paired domain , we were able to use our reagents for this species .
Using EMSAs with the CD19/Pax-5 probe , nuclear extracts from Peromy-seus SRBs showed a specific DNA-protein complex that was removed by anti-paired domain antiserum ED-1 ( data not shown ) .
Spleens were pooled for each age group because of the limiting amount of splenic sample ( Peromyscus spleens are much smaller as compared with BALB/c ) .

This experiment was repeated twice with independent samples , with identical results .
Most strikingly , the 5a.1 and 5a.2 complexes were absent from aged mice , but 5a.2 species was strong in young mice .
Additionally , lower molecular mass Pax-5 species , possibly including Pax-5d as well as Pax-5a degradation products , were detected in both age groups .
As the Pax-5 gene has not been sequenced in this species , we had no information on either the expression or structure of alternative Pax-5 isoforms in P. leucopus .
We conclude that the reduced DNA binding activity of Pax-5a observed in aged B cells from BALB/c is also detectable in a population of outbred mice , suggesting the presence a more general aging mechanism in B cells that is conserved among ( mammalian ) species .
6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology Nuclear Pax-5a protein levels are similar between young and aged mice To investigate whether the observed decrease in DNA binding activity of Pax-5a in aged mice was caused by increased Pax-5a protein degradation , Western blot analysis was performed on nuclear extracts from young and aged ( BALB/c ) mice .
( The remainder of this study was done using BALB/c mice only . )
First , the mouse mAb 6G11 was used to determine the levels of Pax-5d .
This filter was then stripped and reprobed with the anti-paired domain Ab ED-1 and the basal factor TFIID .
The ED-1 antiserum detects Pax-5a as well as any proteolytic fragments of Pax-5a that contain at least a partial paired domain .
An Ab to the basal transcription factor TFIID was used to control for equal loading and quality of extracts .
Using the ED-1 Ab ( Fig .
5 , upper panel ) , we found that both age groups had significant , but variable , levels of degradation of Pax-5a protein , as indicated by the presence of an ~45-kDa proteolytic Pax-5a fragment ( indicated by an asterisk in Fig .
5 ) , but this pattern was similar for both age groups .
The 45-kDa fragment did not represent Pax-5b as this isoform runs at around the 40-kDa position in SDS-PAGE ( 30 ) .
The analysis was repeated using an additional eight young and nine aged SRB samples .
Together , the data show that : 1 ) there is significant variation in the extend of Pax-5 degradation within both age groups , and 2 ) there are no significant differences in Pax-5 protein degradation between the two age groups .
We conclude that the reduced DNA binding activity of Pax-5a is not the result of increased protein degradation in aged samples .
Using the Ab 6G11 , we showed that the levels of Pax-5d protein were similar in young and aged samples ( Fig .
5 , lower panel ) .
The ratio of ( nondegraded ) Pax-5a to Pax-5d was determined for each sample using NIH Image analysis software ( Fig .
5 , numbers below the samples ) .
Together , the results suggest that , although significant protein degradation occurs in all samples , the overall levels of Pax-5a and 5d protein remain unchanged as animals age .
It has been reported that an increased number of CD5 * B cells is present in aged mice ( 4 , 8 ) .

2623 change in B cell population in the spleens of aged mice , we performed Western blot analysis on four whole-cell samples of each age group , using 3 X 10° SRBs for each sample .
No detectable difference in total CD5 levels between young and aged mice was observed in our aged mouse samples ( mice 18-22 mo of age ) , using a goat polyclonal IgG to CD5 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; results not shown ) .
Therefore , at least in the age groups we studied , the observed changes are not the result of a change in the relative number of CD5 * and CDS5~ B cells in aged spleens .
Effect of reduced Pax-5a DNA binding on expression of target genes Next we wished to test whether the observed decrease in Pax-5a DNA binding activity had a measurable effect on gene expression .
As target genes , we focused on the following three genes : CD19 , J chain , and IgH , as all three are expressed in mature B cells and may potentially change as a result of decreased Pax-5a DNA binding activity in aging animals .
Of three different technical approaches attempted ( including RT-PCR , Northern blot analysis , and RNase protection assay ) , only RNase protection assays were sensitive enough to detect changes using the limited amount of samples available , and gave highly reproducible results .
Flow cytometric analysis was performed on three 70 % Percoll fractions from each age group .
Results from these experiments indicated that both age groups contained similar B : T lymphocyte ratios , as determined using anti-B220 and anti-CD3 Abs ( P. Zwollo and Y. Deng , unpublished observations ) .
Using a CDI9 riboprobe detecting exons 5-9 of the murine CD19 gene , no significant changes in CD19 mRNA levels were detected comparing young and aged SRB samples ( results not shown ) .
A second target gene was the IgH gene .
An Ign ( H chain ) riboprobe was designed that would enable detection of both the membrane and secreted Igu transcripts .
Resting , mature B cells ( in young mice ) express mostly the membrane form of Igu , whereas activated B cells switch through a process of alternative splicing to the production of secreted Igu , resulting in high level Ig secretion in plasma cells .
IgH was a particularly important target to test as it had been reported previously that Pax-5a is likely to regulate Ig secretion in `` late `` mature B cells ( 29 ) .
Interestingly , RNase protection assays with riboprobe p ( M & S ) showed a significant increase in the ratio of secreted to membrane Ig transcripts in aged mice , as shown in Fig .
6 ( Teff ) for four young and four aged mice .
To compare for level of B cell activation , we ran RNA samples in parallel in the same gels that were derived from LPS-activated B cells from young mice ( Fig .
6 , right ) : Percoll-purified , LPS-activated SRBs collected 79 h after stimulation showed the expected increase in secreted p ( Fig .
6 , lane 10 ) , and an increase was also detectable in samples that had been activated with LPS for a short period ( 7 h ; Fig .
6 , lane 9 ) or for a long period ( 216 h ; Fig .
6 , lane 11 ) .
To rule out the possibility that SRB samples had been contaminated with plasma cells ( which would skew the ratio toward more secreted Igu transcripts ) , some of the RNA samples were also analyzed by RNase protection assay for the level of Pax-5 transcripts ( see Fig .
2 ) .
The Pax-5 transcript levels in both age groups were identical for all samples , suggesting that similar numbers of mature B cells were present , as plasma cells do not express Pax-5 ( 30 ) .
Furthermore , using NIH Image analysis software , we determined that the ratio of secreted to membrane form of the H chain gene increased up to 5-fold as a result of aging .
It should be noted that there was considerable variation in the level of increase in the aged group , but this was observed in all aged samples ( Fig .

In conclusion , aged mice appear to have abnormal resting B cells that produce low levels of secreted p-chain transcripts .
Lastly , the Ig J chain target gene was used to determine whether decreased Pax-5a activity affects its transcription in aged mice .
Previous studies had shown that Pax-5a acts as a transcriptional repressor for the J chain gene : increased levels of Pax-5a through overexpression in plasma cell lines resulted in a reduction in J chain RNA levels ( 21 , 32 ) .
Here we wished to test whether the opposite situation , namely decreased levels of active Pax-5a in mature B cells , would lead to increased J chain expression .
J chain is expressed at basal levels until B cells become activated ( 21 ) , and this may explain why our signals from RNase protection assays were too low to reliably detect changes in transcript levels between young and aged mice ( not shown ) .
As an alternative approach , we measured changes in J chain expression at the protein level using Western blot analysis .
Whole SRBs from four 2-mo-old and four 19-mo-old mice were counted , and 3 X 10° cells were lysed and analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels .
Whole-cell lysates were used in this experiment to enable quantitative comparison of the NFs Pax-5a and TFIID as well as the cytoplasmic J chain protein .
Pax-5a expression in combination with TFIID levels provided important internal controls for the relative purity of the isolated SRB fractions from young and aged mice .
We had shown earlier ( Fig .
5 ) that the protein levels of Pax-5 remain unchanged with age , thus both young and aged SRB cell fractions should have similar amounts of Pax-5 and the ratio of Pax-5 to TFIID should also remain unchanged .
Given that the same total number of cells was used in each sample , this suggest that similar numbers of B cells were present in each sample , with B PAB 's A SRB 's aged 2 19 19 19 19 pe TFIID - mas ‘ J chain cns : PRR “ Q ” J chain WTFIID : 0.14 0.38 0.09 0.08 20 0.83 10 09 J/TFIID : 0.07 0.06 0.89 0.68 0.25 0.25 1.1 0.76 09 03 0.34 19 1.1 out contamination of plasma cells ( which do not express Pax-5 ) or similarly , changes in number of ( Pax-5-negative ) T cells ( Fig .

Using a polyclonal rabbit anti-J chain serum , very low levels of the 15-kDa J chain protein were detected in SRBs from young mice , as expected , as shown in Fig .
7A ( third row ) .
Interestingly , in aged mice the amount of J chain protein was significantly higher , while both age groups had similar Pax-5a protein levels .
Similar results were obtained when PABs , isolated from 66 % Percoll gradients , were analyzed , as shown in Fig .
7B .
To confirm this result independently , cytoplasmic ( 8-100 ) fractions from SRBs were analyzed by Western blot , loading equal amounts of protein as determined by Bradford analysis ( Fig .
7C ) .
As a control for equal protein loading , the anti-NF- « B/p50 Ab was used , which detects a 110-kDa cytoplasmic precursor protein in the cytoplasm of SRBs ( 35 ) .
Using this approach , we were able to show that the levels of J chain protein are consistently higher in the cytoplasm of aged B cells as compared with young B cells .
These experiments , together with the EMSAs described earlier , suggest that reduced Pax-5a activity in aged SRB cells correlates with increased expression of at least two Pax-5 target genes , the J chain and the Igu H chain gene .
Discussion Substantial reduction in both cellular and humoral immune responses have been associated with immune senescence observed in aging humans and rodents .
Many of the observed changes in the B cell response have been correlated with changing expression patterns of B cell-specific proteins that are structurally or functionally associated with the B cell receptor .

6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology these changes have a common cause , namely the deregulation of transcription factor ( s ) normally expressed during B cell matura-tion .
The molecular basis for these changes was investigated by measuring the levels of the transcription factor Pax-5 , which has been shown to play essential roles during B cell development and differentiation .
We focused our studies on an enriched population of mature SRBs because it comprises a well-defined and relatively uniform B cell population .
Decreased DNA binding activity of Pax-5a in aged mice Our results show that the DNA binding activity of Pax-5a protein is strongly reduced in splenic B cells from aged mice , whereas activity or protein levels of Pax-5d do not change significantly .
Decreased Pax-5a binding activity is not the result of decreased levels of Pax-5a RNA transcripts or overall protein levels , as shown by RNase protection assays and Western blot analyses .
These data are in agreement with the hypothesis that a posttranslational mechanism affects Pax-5 activity in aged B cells , possibly involving proteolytic and/or redox activities .
Our results are similar to a study by Ammendola et al .
who studied the transcription factor Spl in aged rat brain and liver tissues ( 36 ) .
The authors found that the DNA binding activity of Sp1 dropped ( 60-fold ) with age , although no change either at the transcriptional or protein level was detected ( 36 ) .
Ammendola 's study is important as it supports our finding that changes in gene expression in aged cells may occur through posttranslational modifications of transcription factors .
An interesting report by Tell et al .
provides a possible explanation for the observed decreases in Pax-5a DNA binding activity in aged B cells ( 37 ) .
It has been well-documented that chronic exposure to reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) can lead to aging and age-related pathology .
Tell et al .
found that ROS may affect gene expression by modulating Pax-5a activity using cell lines .
Importantly , the authors show that an oxidized form of Pax-5a is unable to interact with DNA , whereas the reduced form binds strongly ( 37 ) .
It was further shown that an intramolecular disulfide bond within the paired domain of Pax-5a causes interference with specific DNA binding ( 37 ) .
In a follow-up study ( 38 ) , the authors show a positive correlation between exposure ( of a B cell line ) to the ROS-inducing substance H , O , and rapid transfer of the cytoplasmic redox factor Ref-1 into the nucleus .
This increase in nuclear Ref-1 is also correlated with an increase in Pax-5a binding activity in the nucleus using an in vitro assay ( 38 ) .
The Tell et al .
( 37 , 38 ) data are important in regard to our results , because it is likely that a changed redox state of Pax-5a is responsible for the observed reduction in its DNA binding activity in aged B cells .
The notion that Ref-1 is involved in redox regulation of Pax-5a is also supported by recent reports on its role in the redox activation of other inducible transcription factors such as Pax-8 , NF- « B/p50 , and Jun ( 39-41 ) .
It is noteworthy to mention here that isoform Pax-5d , which does not appear to be sensitive to age-related processes , has two cysteine residues within its unique 42-aa C-terminal region ( 30 ) .
Whether these cysteine residues play a role in redox regulation and/or protein stability is currently under investigation in our laboratory .
We have recently observed changes in Ref-1 levels in nuclear extracts from aged mice ( P. Zwollo , unpublished observations ) , supporting the idea that Ref-1 function may be linked to Pax-5 activity during the aging process .
Together , Tell 's and our own findings provide the basis for future studies investigating the functional significance of ROS and its association with posttranslational changes in transcription factors in aged animals .
2625 Pax-5a activity inversely correlates with both J chain and secreted Igy .
expression in aging B cells Pax-5d has no transactivation domain but has similar in vitro DNA affinity as Pax-5a ( 30 ) and is thus likely to represent a dominant-negative form of Pax-5a .
The observed decrease in DNA binding activity of Pax-5a correlated with increased relative levels of DNA-bound Pax-5d in aged B cells in vitro .
Resulting changes in the 5a:5d ratio in aged B cells may cause down-regulation of Pax-5 target genes that are normally expressed and , vice versa , may aid in the de-repression ( or activation ) of target genes that are normally suppressed .
Perhaps the most exciting results from this study suggest that decreased Pax-5a activity correlates with increased expression of two Pax-5 target genes in aged B cells , the Ig J chain and the secreted form of Ig .
Interestingly , Pax-5 functions as a transcriptional repressor for both genes .
In the case of the J chain gene , earlier studies using B cell lines had already shown that J chain expression is largely determined by nuclear levels of Pax-5a ( 21 , 32 ) .
Pax-5a represses J chain expression in mature B cells , whereas forced overexpression of Pax-5a in plasma cell lines leads to suppression of J chain expression ( 31 ) .
The observed expression of J chain in aged , resting ( high-density ) mature B cells clearly illustrates an `` abnormality `` of the aged mature B cell phenotype , because J chain is not normally expressed until the activated B cell stage .
Similarly , the observed increase in secreted Ig suggests that in aged mature B cells , Pax-5a , which normally prevents secretion of IgM through interaction with the IgH 3 ' enhancer , is no longer able to sufficiently suppress gene expression .

( 29 ) in which cloned late mature B cells ( CH12.LX.A2 ) were analyzed for levels of Pax-5a RNA as well as both membrane and secreted Ig mRNA , observed that reduced Pax-5 RNA was always found in high Ig-secreting clones and vice versa .
This group proposed that reduction of Pax-5a levels play a direct role in the switch from membrane to secreted Ig transcript processing ( 29 ) .
Whether this alternative splicing event is modulated through the Ig 3 ' enhancer remains to be determined .
From our own data it appears that during the aging process , although Pax-5 transcript levels remain the same , posttranslational changes of Pax-5a have a similar , de-re-pressing effect , resulting in the presence of secreted Igu transcripts in resting B cells .
This is likely to result in an increased level of secreted IgM in aged B cells .
We hypothesize that decreased DNA binding activity of Pax-5a and/or increased binding of Pax-5d in aged B cells is linked to the observed `` spontaneous `` secretion of Abs in the absence of pathogens ( 8 ) .
We are currently investigating whether isoform Pax-5d actively de-represses J chain and/or secreted Ig expression in this situation , or whether reduced Pax-5a binding by itself may be sufficient to ( at least partially ) release transcriptional suppression .
No effects of aging were observed for the target gene CDI9 using RNase protection assays .
This may be the result of the high-affinity Pax-5 binding site on the CDI9 promoter , as compared with the lower-affinity sites on the J chain promoter and Igu H chain 3 ' enhancer , as measured by Wallin et al .
( 42 ) .
It has been observed that during the early stages of a B cell immune response , Pax-5a maintains its activator functions ( e.g .
, not affecting CD19 ) but is relieved of its repressor functions ( e.g .
, inducing J chain and Ig expression ) ( 42 ) .
Wallin 's study ( 42 ) showed that activator motifs had a 20-fold higher binding affinity for Pax-5 binding sites as compared with repressor motifs .
Thus when the available amount of Pax-5a decreases in aged B cells , this likely affects repressor functions first .
Alternatively , it is possible that although 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 2626 Pax-5a is essential for CD19 expression during early B cell development , there may be more functional redundancy during late B cell stages .
Other effects of decreased Pax-5a activity in aged mice ?
The observed reduction in class switching from IgM to IgG isotype Abs in B cells from aged mice ( 4 ) may also be caused by the decrease in Pax-5a activity .
One study in which antisense Pax-5a oligonucleotides were used to down-regulate Pax-5a expression showed that this caused decreased class switching from IgM to IgG ( 15 ) , although it can not not be ruled out that the lack of isoform switching was simply the result of a lack of cell proliferation .
In support for a role in cell proliferation , antisense oligonucleotides that reduce Pax-5a expression also block mature B cell proliferation in response to LPSs ( 14 ) .
Thus , a decrease in Pax-5a activity may play a role in the reduced B cell proliferation and/or class switching responses that have been observed in aging humans and rodents .
In summary , the reduction in Pax-5Sa DNA binding activity in aged mature B cells and the inappropriate expression of two of its target genes provide evidence that dysregulation of this important transcription factor may be associated with the abnormal B cell phenotype in aged mice .
This is the first study to describe a change in the activity of a B cell-specific transcription factor with age , and we propose a molecular mechanism that may be central to the induction of immune senescence in aging B cells .
