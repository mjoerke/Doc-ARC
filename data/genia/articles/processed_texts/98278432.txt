0 CASE REPORT OQ Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Involving Bilateral Breasts Toshio Krrawakt , Noboru YonETANI , Hiroshi AKasaka , Takashi Axasaka , Hitoshi Ono and Minoru OKuUmMa We describe here two cases of diffuse large cell type non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma affecting the bilateral breasts .
The contralateral tumor in one case appeared 17 months after the first mastectomy , whereas the bilateral tumors occurred concurrently in the other patient who was pregnant and showed widespread dissemination at initial presentation .
Lymphoma cells from both cases showed the mature B-cell immunophenotype and had rearrangements of the BCLG gene .
Both patients developed progressive disease despite chemo-radiotherapy and died of leukemic manifes-tations .
There were no apparent pathological features of lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue origin .

In two large Japanese series , a total of 26 cases with PBL have been reported ( 4 , 5 ) .
The majority of these cases showed diffuse large cell histopathology and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the lymphoma cells almost invariably had the B-cell phenotype .
Of the 26 cases , two had a bilateral disease and Jeon et al ( 5 ) suggested a distinctive subgroup of PBL affecting the bilateral breasts in younger women .
In the present report , we describe two patients with PBL involving the bilateral breasts .
The clinical behavior , immunophenotype of the lymphoma cells and the state of oncogenes are discussed .

Case Report Case 1 ( # 849 ) The patient was a 42-year-old Japanese woman who had noticed a lump in the right breast in July 1993 .
She was referred to the surgery department and underwent modified radical mastectomy in September .
Microscopic examination of the tumor , which was 5 cm in diameter , revealed NHL .
Axillary and subclavicular lymph nodes were negative for the lymphoma cells .
She was referred to our department and treated with 6 cycles of CHOP ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vin-cristine and prednisolone ) regimen .
In April 1994 , she noticed nodules underneath the surgical scar , which were proved to be localized recurrence .
She was treated with radiotherapy followed by another chemotherapy regimen .
In February 1995 , however , her left breast was swollen and a left axillary adenopa-thy was apparent .
She underwent a second mastectomy , revealing the relapse of NHL , and was admitted to our department thereafter .
On examination , she had no superficial lymphade-nopathy .
Liver and spleen were not felt .
A computer-assisted tomographic ( CAT ) scan of the body merely disclosed an equivocal mediastinal adenopathy .
However , examination of peripheral blood films disclosed neoplastic cells comprising 20 % to 30 % of total nucleated cells , and the neoplastic cells infiltrated the bone marrow .
The serum was negative for anti-human T-cell lymphotrophic virus ( HTLV-I ) antibody and anti-human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody .
She was treated with salvage chemotherapy protocols , although she responded transiently .
She was febrile over two months and her general condition progressively deteriorated .
She died two years after the initial presentation .
Case 2 ( # 910 ) The patient was a 35-year-old Japanese woman who had noticed a lump in the right breast in October 1995 .
Because she was pregnant at that time , she was reluctant to be referred to From the First Division , Department of Internal Medicine , Faculty of Medicine , Kyoto University , Kyoto Received for publication June 16 , 1997 ; Accepted for publication November 26 , 1997 Reprint requests should be addressed to Dr. Hitoshi Ohno , the First Division , Department of Internal Medicine , Faculty of Medicine , Kyoto University , 54 Shogoin-Kawaramachi , Sakyo-ku , Kyoto 606-8507 Internal Medicine Vol .

However , the breast tumor grew rapidly in January 1996 .
She underwent an abortion and was referred to the surgery department .
On examination , the tumor of the right breast was 14 cm in diameter and the overlying skin was infiltrated .
Several tumors were palpable in the left breast .
She underwent mastectomy of the right breast and biopsy of the left breast tumor .
Microscopic examination of the surgical specimens revealed NHL .
She was then referred to our department to receive chemotherapy in March 1996 .
On examination , she had generalized superficial lymphadenopathy as well as tumors of the left breast .
Imaging studies of the body , including CAT scan , gallium-scintigraphy , bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging , disclosed systemic enlargement of lymph nodes as well as involvement of the bone , right ovary and cervix of the uterus .
The serum was negative for anti-HTLV-I and anti-HIV antibodies .
She was treated with the biweekly CHOP regimen and responded well .
However , she showed right facial nerve palsy and complained of severe pain in both legs .
Lumbar puncture disclosed lymphoma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid .
Methotrexate and prednisolone were repeatedly injected intrathecally , resulting in improvement of the neurological symptoms .
She was then treated with high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell support .
Shortly after recovery of hematopoiesis , the skin overlying the left breast was infiltrated ; she refused additional treatment and was dis-charged .
In November 1996 , she was readmitted due to a huge mass of the right axillary region and the florid left breast tumor .
She has been treated with chemo-radiotherapy in addition to left mastectomy .
However , the lymphoma showed leukemic manifestations and she died 19 months after the initial presentation .
Hematopathological findings The breast tumors in both cases showed diffuse proliferation of large lymphoid cells and infiltration to surrounding tissues ( Figs .
1 and 2A ) .
Regional lymph nodes of case 2 were composed of cells with nuclear diameter greater than the admixed Â£ * ab & ) 38 s Figure 1. stain , x180 ) .
The lymphoma cells were intermediate to large in size .
Multinucleated cells were occasionally seen .

Lymphoepithelial lesions or plasmacytoid differentiation were not apparent .
In accordance with the criteria of the REAL classification ( 6 ) , the two lymphomas were categorized as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma .
Figure 3 shows lymphoma cells in the peripheral blood .
The cells of both cases had basophilic cytoplasm containing multiple vacuoles .
Nucleoli were prominent .
Immunophenotyping of the lymphoma cells Mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of case 1 by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation .
Breast tumors from case 2 were finely minced in phosphate-buffered saline and cells suspended in the buffer were collected .
Surface immunophenotypes of these specimens were determined by an indirect immunofluorescence method using flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies .
As summarized in Table 1 , the peripheral blood of case 1 included nearly 30 % lymphoma cells expressing the CD19 , CD20 , HLA-DR antigens as Figure 2 .

The lymphoma cells of case 2 showed the identical mature B-cell immunophenotype ; the cells partially expressed the CD25 antigen .
Both lymphoma cells lacked CDS expression .
Other T-cell- , NK-cell- , granulocyte/macrophage-associated markers were negative .
State of oncogenes and Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) genome in the lymphoma cells Genomic DNA was extracted from breast tumors and subjected to molecular analysis to determine the state of oncogenes related to the development of B-cell NHL .
Rearrangement of the c-MYC and BCL2 genes , involved in t ( 8 ; 14 ) ( q24 ; q32 ) and t ( 14 ; 18 ) ( q32 ; q21 ) translocations , respectively , were studied by long-distance polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using primer pairs designed for the two oncogenes and the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IGH ) gene ( 7 , 8 ) .
The DNA from both cases was negative for the c-MYC/IGH fusion product indicative of t ( 8 ; 14 ) or the BCL2/IGH fusion of t ( 14 ; 18 ) ( data not shown ) .
Rearrangement of the BCLG gene on chromosomal band 3q27 was studied by conventional Southern blot analysis using a probe for the major translocation cluster ( MTC ) region of BCL6 ( 9 , 10 ) .
As shown in Fig .
4 , DNA from both patients showed rearrangements of this gene .
Cytogenetic analysis of the breast tumor obtained from case 2 , with the knowledge of the rearrangement , failed to identify evident involvement of the 3q27 region due to poor metaphase quality .
The presence of the EBV genome was studied by PCR amplification of the EBV-encoded small RNA region ( 11 ) , using DNA from African Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) -derived cell lines as the control .
The DNA from both cases showed no amplification ( data not shown ) .
Discussion Literature reviews of PBL have indicated that there are two distinct clinicopathological subtypes ( 2 , 5 ) : the unilateral subtype Internal Medicine Vol .

that shows indolent to aggressive histology and mimics breast carcinoma in age distribution , and the bilateral subtype affecting pregnant or lactating women .
The latter group is further characterized by widespread dissemination with prominent ovarian and central nervous system involvement , and characteristic histological findings identical to those of BL have been reported in African women ( 12 ) .
Here , we described two patients with PBL involving the bilateral breasts and their characteristics are summarized in Table 2 .
Both patients were younger than the median age for NHL .
Case 2 was pregnant at the time of presentation .
Bilateral tumors occurred concurrently in case 2 , whereas in case 1 the second tumor of the contralateral breast appeared 17 months after the first mastectomy .
Both patients developed progressive disease despite chemo-radiotherapy and died of leukemic mani-festations .
In case 1 , no other organs except for the axillary lymph nodes were involved during the course of the disease .
In contrast , case 2 had rapidly growing bilateral tumors as well as systemic dissemination at the initial presentation , indicating that the disease had characteristic features of the bilateral subtype ; indeed , the lymph nodes showed packed proliferation of large cells with macrophage infiltration , suggesting high grade histopathology .
However , the tumor lacked molecular evidence of t ( 8 ; 14 ) which has been observed in 85 % of BL ( 13 ) , although our method may have missed its variant , t ( 2 ; 8 ) ( p12 ; q24 ) or ( 8 ; 22 ) ( q24 ; q1 1 ) .

3 ( March 1998 ) Lymphoma of Bilateral Breasts MYC gene is deregulated in this particular type of PBL .
PBL has been suggested to be an extranodal lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues ( MALT ) ( 1-5 ) .
However , histopathological observation of the present cases failed to identify characteristic features of lymphomas of MALT type .
On the other hand , both cases had BCLG rearrangements as common genetic lesions , which have been mainly observed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( 10 , 14 ) .
In our initial study ( 15 ) , MALT lymphoma with low grade histology occurring in other MALT sites showed germline configuration of BCL6 , and t ( 11 ; 18 ) ( q21 ; q21.1 ) has been reported as a potential specific translocation of MALT type NHL ( 16 ) .
Thus , it was suggested that the two PBL presented here were not of MALT origin but de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma .
It remains to be elucidated why the current lymphomas preferentially involved the breast tissues .
