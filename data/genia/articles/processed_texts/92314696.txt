Volume 1 + Number 1 + April 1991 GENE EXPRESSION Every enhancer works with every promoter for all the combinations tested : could new regulatory pathways evolve by enhancer shuffling ?
Milko Kermekchiev , Monica Pettersson , Patrick Matthias and Walter Schaffner Institute for Molecular Biology II , University of Zurich The promoters and enhancers of cell type-specific genes are often conserved in evolution , and hence one might expect that a given enhancer has evolved to work best with its own promoter .
While this expectation may be realized in some cases , we have not found evidence for it .
A total of 27 combinations of different promoters and enhancers were tested by transfection into cultured cells .
We found that the relative efficiency of the enhancers is approximately the same , irrespective of the type of promoter used , i.e .
, there was no strong preference for any given enhancer/promoter combination .
Notably , we do not see particularly strong transcription when the immunoglobulin kappa enhancer ( or the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ) is used to activate a kappa gene promoter .
We propose that a generally permissive enhancer/promoter interaction is of evolutionary benefit for higher eukaryotes : by enhancer shuffling , genes could be easily brought under a new type of inducibility/cell type specificity .
Regulatory regions for eukaryotic RNA polymerase II transcription units are located both upstream and downstream of the RNA start site and are usually defined as ( proximal ) promoters and ( remote ) enhancers .
The difference between an enhancer and a promoter is largely operational , since both are composed of a number of short DNA sequence motifs that serve as recognition sequences for transcription fac-tors .
Enhancers can act in either orientation and over long distances , whether tested on homologous or heterologous promoters ( reviewed in Serfling et al .
, 1985 ) .
Some of these cis-acting DNA sequence motifs ( = modules , elements ) are preferentially found in either a promoter or an enhancer position , whereas others , like the octamer motif , can be found in close proximity to the transcriptional start site as well as at remote positions .
The activity of a particular cis-acting element varies between different cell types .
The general picture emerging from studies in several laboratories is that the concentration of the active form of a transcription factor , as well as the number and affinity of corresponding binding sites on the DNA , influence the level of transcription ( for reviews , see Maniatis et al .
, 1987 ; Miiller et al .
, 1988a ; Mitchell and Tjian , 1989 ; Johnson and McKnight , 1989 ) .
In principle , a single binding site in conjunction with a corresponding transcription factor can be subject to cell type-specific ( or in-ducible ) regulation ( Dreyfus et al .
, 1987 ; Wirth et al .
, 1987 ; Gerster et al .
, 1987 ) .
The interplay between the various factors is as yet poorly understood , but it influences gene activity as well ( see , for example , Hu et al .
, 1990 ; Murre et al .
, 1990 ; Schatt et al .
, 1990 ; for reviews see Mitchell and Tjian , 1989 ; Johnson and Received December 17 , 1990 ; revision accepted January 15 , 1991 .

The enhancer of immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) genes was the first example found of an enhancer associated with a cellular gene , and also the first component identified in the then enigmatic phenomenon of cell type-specific gene expression ( Banerji et al .
, 1983 ; Gillies et al .
, 1983 , Neuberger , 1983 ) .
The IgH enhancer shows a strict cell type specificity : it is active in B lymphocytes but not , for example , in epi-thelial or fibroblast cells .
Subsequently , it was found that not only the Ig enhancers but also the promoters of Ig heavy and light chain genes are preferentially active in lymphoid cells ( Falk-ner et al .
, 1984 ; Picard and Schaffner , 1985 ; Mason et al .
, 1985 ; Grosschedl and Baltimore , 1985 ; Foster et al .
, 1985 ; Mizushima-Sugano and Roeder , 1986 ) .
It is well-established that a functional enhancer and a promoter act synergistically to bring about strong transcription .
There are also reports that there is an additional level of specificity to this enhancer-promoter interaction .
For example , Garcia et al .
( 1986 ) have proposed that the cell type-specific immunoglobulin gene enhancers are preferentially active in combination with their own promoters .
Such preferences could have been the result of coevolution of an enhancer and its corresponding promoter .
We have addressed the question of preferential activity by analyzing the functional cooperation between given promoter and enhancer sequences with a number of construc-tions .
We wanted to determine whether it was possible , for example , to create a particularly strong transcription unit by having the same DNA motif act from both an upstream and a downstream position .
The results presented in this paper , which were obtained by measuring expression of transiently transfected cell lines , do not indicate a marked preference for a par Kermekchiev et al .
ticular enhancer/promoter combination .
Rather , different promoters were always activated to about the same relative level by the various enhancers tested .
This ability to combine various enhancers and promoters may have facilitated the evolution of new regulatory pathways .
Materials and methods Construction of plasmids All clones were constructed according to standard recombinant DNA protocols ( Maniatis et al .
, 1982 ) .
The plasmid constructs containing the Ig kappa-promoter and its derivatives are based on the pK plasmid ( Picard and Schaffner , 1985 ) in which different promoter and enhancer elements were placed upstream and downstream , respectively , of a truncated B-globin gene ( Fig .
1A ) .
In the KapP series a promoter fragment ( Ddel-Hinfl ) from a mouse x-light chain gene , including the octamer and TATA box sequences as well as the cap site ( nucleotides - 180 to +22 ) was fused to the B-globin reporter gene .
In the two promoter variants Kap ( - ) P and SpIlP , the octamer motif of the promoter was replaced by its mutated variant or by the binding site for Spl , respectively , preserving the original TATA box .
To this end , a 52 bp Pvull-StyI fragment in KapP was replaced by synthetic se-quences , as shown below : KapP wild type octamer _ 5 ATTTGCAT TAAACGTA 5 Kap ( - ) P _ mutated octamer 5 ATGTTCAG TACAAGTC 5 SpIP Spl binding site 5 GGGCGGGGC ( HSV ) CCCGCCCCG 5 The enhancer elements were inserted downstream of the test gene : IgLE , a 480 bp Alul frag- Figure 1 .

B. DNA constructs with the SV40 promoter .
The 21 bp repeats from the early promoter region of SV40 containing 5 functional Spl binding sites ( stippled boxes ) were placed in front of the B-globin gene ( white region ) .
The enhancers used are identical to some of those shown in A. C. DNA constructs containing the OVEC reporter gene .
OVEC is a reporter gene containing the coding sequence of the rabbit B-globin gene ( as are the constructs in A and B ) and convenient cloning sites for promoter and enhancer elements ( Westin et al .
, 1987 ) .
DNA oligonucleotides containing a single or a duplicated binding site for different transcription factors were inserted upstream of the B-globin TATA box ( white ) .
These promoter constructions were tested with the SV40 enhancer or a multimeric NF-xB enhancer .

, 1982 ) .
The synthetic enhancers used in the plasmid series , E4 OcE and E4 ( - ) OcEF , consist of six repeated 51 bp fragments from the IgH enhancer , each consisting of the octamer sequence plus a functional or mutated E4 motif , respectively ( Gerster et al .
, 1987 ) .
The reference plasmid REF was described previously ( Picard and Schaffner , 1985 ) .
The SVP constructs ( Fig .
1B ) contain an SV40 fragment consisting of the three 21 bp early promoter repeats ( five Spl binding sites ) , was placed in front of the TATA box of the B-globin gene , whose first intron in this case was preserved .
The two plasmids containing the rabbit f-globin promoter are described in Gerster et al .
( 1987 ) .
The OVEC system ( Westin et al .
, 1987 ) was employed to construct the series of plasmids containing single transcription factor binding sites .
Oligonucleotides with the octamer ( oct ) or NF- « xB binding sites or the Pu box ( Pu ) were synthesized with Sacl and Sall protruding ends and inserted in front of the TATA box .
The Spl oligonucleotide ( 2 Spl ) contains a dimer of a binding site found in the immediate early gene 3 of herpes simplex virus .
It was synthesized with blunt ends and ligated into the Sall site , which was filled in by T4 polymerase .
The sequences of the oligonucleotides are shown in Table 1 .
The reference plasmid used for this series of plasmids was OVEC-REF ( Westin et al .
, 1987 ) .

Cell growth , transfection , and RNA analysis The human lymphoblastoid cell line BJA-B and the myeloma cells X63Ag8 were grown in RPMI and DMEM media , respectively .
Both media were supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomy-cin .
The cells were transfected with 5 or 10 ug test plasmid and 2 ug reference by the DEAE-dextran procedure followed by a DMSO boost .
Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated 40-42 hr after transfection and purified as described previously ( De Villiers and Schaffner , 1983 ) .
The specific transcripts were quantitated by ribonuclease mapping ( Melton et al .
, 1984 , with some modifications , see Picard and Schaffner , 1985 ) or S1 nuclease analysis ( de Villiers and Schaffner , 1983 ) .
For S1 nuclease analysis of the transcripts from the KapP constructs and their derivatives , as well as for the SVP constructs , a BamHI-labeled Sacl-BamHI fragment ( nucleotides -195 to +215 ) was used as probe .
The reverse SP6 polymerase transcript of the same fragment was used for ribonuclease mapping ( Picard and Schaffner , 1985 ) .

Activity of the SV40 promoter .
The same proce- dure as in A was used for transcriptional analysis of the SV40 promoter constructs depicted in B .
The activation of this promoter by the IgH ( heavy ) - and IgL ( x ) -enhancers is shown in lanes 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively .
`` 0 , `` SV40 promoter construct without enhancer .
All other designations are as in A. hancer , or with one of the following six enhance-ers : 1 .
The homologous immunoglobulin kappa enhancer located within the J/C intron ( Queen and Baltimore , 1983 ; Picard and Schaffner , 1984 ) .
We have previously tested this enhancer with the B-globin promoter and the SV40 early promoter , where it shows only about 5 % of the activity of the strong enhancer from immunoglobulin heavy chain genes ( Picard and Schaffner , 1984 ) .
Others have reported that a preferential interaction between the kappa enhancer and kappa promoter results in a transcriptional efficiency approaching that seen with strong enhancers ( Garcia et al .
, 1986 ) .
2 .
The IgH enhancer , which is also B cell-specific , as mentioned above ( Banerji et al .
, 1983 ; Gillies et al .
, 1983 ; Neuberger , 1983 ) .
3 .
The SV40 enhancer , the first described and thoroughly characterized enhancer ( Banerji et al .
, 1981 ; Mor-eau et al .
, 1981 ) .
Under natural circumstances , it drives expression from the SV40 early promoter that contains multiple sites for the transcription factor Spl and a weak TATA box ( Mathis and Chambon , 1981 ; Benoist and Chambon , 1981 ; Dynan and Tjian , 1983 ) .
4 .
The enhancer from the Moloney retrovirus ( MSV ) ( Levinson et al .
, 1982 ) .
5 .
A synthetic enhancer composed of 6 identical tandem segments of 50 bp from the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer , containing both an octamer motif and an Ephrussi 4 motif ( Gerster et al .
, 1987 ) .
6 .
The same synthetic enhancer with the Ephrussi 4 motif mutated , leaving only the octamer motif intact .
Both synthetic enhancers retain the lymphocyte-specificity of the complete IgH enhancer ( Gerster et al .
, 1987 ) .
As seen in Figure 2A , all the enhancers tested are active ; however , the kappa light chain enhancer ( IgLE ) is only about 10 % as active as the heavy chain enhancer and only 5 % as active as the SV40 enhancer .
Similar results are obtained in J-558 myeloma cells ( not shown ) .
These data indicate that the kappa enhancer , which is known to be weakly active with non-homologous promoters , does not perform significantly better with a corresponding kappa promoter .
A possible solution to the paradox of the low activity of this kappa enhancer has recently been found with the identification of a second enhancer located downstream of the constant region of the kappa gene ( Meyer and Neuberger , 1989 ) .
The same order of relative activity is also observed with a different promoter , namely the SV40 early promoter , whose major components are 5 binding sites for the Spl factor ( Fig .
2B ) .

In addition to the kappa promoter , we also tested a derivative in which the octamer motif was replaced by consensus binding sites for Spl factor ( Fig .
1A ) .
Both the kappa promoter and the Spl promoter were tested in parallel with the four natural enhancers , namely the Ig kappa light and heavy chain gene enhancers and the SV40 and MSV viral enhancers .
The results of the transfections are shown in Figure 3 .
As is evident , the Spl-containing promoter is weaker ref re f 10 © % tiny , the enhancers from IgL ( x ) ( A ) ; IgH ( heavy chain ) ( B ) ; SV40 ( C ) or MoMSV ( D ) were analyzed by S1 nuclease mapping .

All other designations are as in Figure 2 .
Mappings shown in A and B were run on the same gel along with the same size marker lane .
The bands between the `` ref- and `` ct `` bands are from read-through transcription of the reference plasmid .
To improve presentation of the data , different G autoradiogram exposures are \Q shown for A and B , and the size 0 marker is now shown at the sides of both A and B. than the kappa promoter in the BJA-B cells .
More importantly , it is also obvious that the relative efficiency of the Spl vs. wild-type kappa promoter is about the same for each of the four enhancers tested .
These results indicate that there is neither a preference of the immunoglobulin enhancers for the Ig kappa promoter , nor a preference of the viral enhancers for the Spl-containing promoter , as was already indicated from the experiments show in Figure 2B .
Transcriptional activity of different promoter constructions driven by the SV40 enhancer or a multimer of the NF-xB binding site In a final series of experiments , we constructed a series of promoters where one or two binding Na evidence for enhancer/promoter preference sites for a single transcription factor were placed upstream of the -globin TATA box in the OVEC reporter plasmid ( Westin et al .
, 1987 ) .
These promoters contain the binding site for either the octamer factors ( Wirth et al .
, 1987 ; Muller et al .
, 1988b ) , NF-xB , a transcription factor that is constitutively active in B lymphocytes , the so-called Pu box factor that confers lymphoid : specific activity ( Moreau-Gachelin et al .
, 1990 ; Karim et al .
, 1990 ) , or the Spl factor ( reviewed in Dynan and Tjian , 1985 ; Kadonaga et al .
, 1986 ) .
All of these promoter constructs were tested with either the generally active SV40 enhancer or with eight tandem copies of the binding site for NF-xB ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986 ; Atchison and Perry , 1987 ; Lenardo et al .
, 1987 ; cloning of NF-xB , see Gosh et al .
, 1990 ; Kieran et al .
, 1990 ; for review , see Lenardo and Baltimore , 1989 ) .
In addition , a construction containing the entire B-globin promoter was included in the analysis .
The constructs were transfected into X63Ag8 myeloma cells together with the reference plasmid OVEC-REFE and the amount of specific transcripts was determined by ribonuclease mapping .
When transcription is driven from a solitary TATA box , no synthesis of reporter gene mRNA is detected ( Fig .
4A , lane 1 ) .
Low levels of transcription are observed with the B-globin promoter , as well as with those constructions containing the NF-xB or Pu box monomer in front of the TATA box ( Fig .
4A , lanes 3 , 4 , and 6 ) .
With the octamer or the Spl upstream promoter sites , a higher level of specific transcription is observed ( Fig .
4A , lanes 2 and 5 ) .
The expression level driven by the two enhancers differs among the various promoters .
A very low level of expression is seen from a crippled promoter consisting of just a TATA box , even if the SV40 enhancer or the 8xNF-xB enhancer are present in a downstream position ( Fig .
4B and C , lane 1 ) .
In contrast , insertion of the various cis-acting motifs in front of the TATA box results in strong transcription with either of the two enhancers linked to the gene .
The strongest stimulation is seen with the octamer- and Spl-containing promoters ( Fig .
4B and C , lanes 2 and 5 ) .
These are also the promoters which by themselves give the highest basal activity ( see Fig .
4A ) .
When directly compared , both enhancers analyzed activate a particular promoter to about the same extent ( compare Fig .
4B and C , lanes 2-6 ) .
Although 77 1 2 °3 4.5 6 7 Figure 4 .

The level of transcription was measured from different promoters without an enhancer ( A ) , with the SV40 enhancer ( B ) , or with eight NF-xB sites ( C ) .
The constructs used are schematically drawn in Figure 1C .
The following promoters were tested : TATA box alone ( lane 1 ) ; the octamer motif ( lane 2 ) ; the NF-xB binding site ( lane 3 ) ; the Pu box ( lane 4 ) ; the GC box , recognized by the Spl transcription factor ( lane 5 ) ; and the entire -globin promoter ( lane 6 ) .
The constructs were transfected into X63Ag8 myeloma cells and the amount of B-globin mRNA quantitated by RNase mapping .
ct indicates correctly initiated transcripts , and ref indicates the transcripts from OVEC-REF ( Westin et al .
, 1987 ) which was included as an internal reference for transfection efficiency .
Hpall digested pBR322 DNA was used as size marker ( lane 7 ) .
78 there may be small variations in this set of experiments ( for example , it appears that transcription is some 2-3 times more efficient when the octamer-containing promoter is linked to the `` NF-xB enhancer `` as compared to the SV40 enhancer ) , we do not observe a marked preferential interaction for any of the enhancer/ promoter combinations .
Discussion No general evidence for enhancer/ promoter preference It is well established that an enhancer and a promoter can act synergistically to yield a level of transcription greater than the sum of the levels achieved by each element individually .
We have tested whether there are specific preferences between certain enhancers and promoters .
By transfection into cultured cell lines , we have analyzed a total of 27 enhancer/promoter combinations , and we see no preferential interaction ( more than a factor of 2-3 fold ) between any given enhancer and promoter .
Since each enhancer activates all of the promoters tested , our results show that there is a great flexibility in the interaction between mammalian transcriptional control elements .
When we initiated our studies , we expected to find cases of exclusive or at least particularly high-activity with a naturally occurring enhancer/ promoter combination .
After all , coevolution of components involved in the same regulatory pathway is a common biological phenomenon .
Not unexpectedly , regulatory sequences of genes transcribed by different RNA polymerases can have diverged such that they are not compatible , such as a thymidine kinase promoter ( RNA polymerase II ) and an rDNA enhancer ( RNA polymerase I ) ( Pape et al .
, 1989 ) .
Also , the highly specialized U2 snRNA genes , even though transcribed by RNA polymerase II , can not be activated by an SV40 enhancer ( Tanaka et al .
, 1988 ) .
In addition to some reports on preferential activity of certain enhancer/promoter combinations ( see below ) , one set of observations seems to strengthen the argument for coevolution resulting in made-to- measure enhancer/ promoter combinations .
In several of the cases analyzed so far , including the Ig heavy chain locus , binding sites for a given transcription factor are present both in a enhancer and in a proxi- Kermekchiev et al .
mal promoter region ( see , for example , Gerster et al .
, 1987 ; Landschulz et al .
, 1988 ; Wall et al .
, 1988 ) .
In the Ig heavy chain genes , the octamer motif ATGCAAAT is present both in the promoter and , in inverse orientation , the enhancer .
Thus it was tempting to speculate that , for example , dimerization of octamer factors would link up the enhancer and promoter .
A precedent for such an interaction is found in pro-karyotes : cooperative repressor binding can bring together operator sites over distances of more than one hundred bp , with concomitant looping out of the intervening DNA ( for reviews see Ptashne , 1986 ; Lobell and Schleif , 1990 ) .
However , so far no evidence has been obtained for cooperative binding of a factor over the long distances that can separate enhancers and promoters , even though enhancer and promoter have been shown to functionally interact when brought in close proximity via a protein bridge ( Muller et al .
, 1989 ; for review see Muller and Schaffner , 1990 ) .
Furthermore , our present experiments fail to show a significant improvement in activity when the enhancer and promoter contain the same factor binding site .
A similar lack of preference is also found in HeLa cells when an enhancer with multiple glucocorti-coid-responsive elements ( GREs ) is tested with GRE promoters versus an Spl promoter ( Schatt et al .
, 1990 ) .
Therefore , it may be that the interaction between factors bound to enhancers and promoters is not direct , as in prokaryotic repressor binding , but rather mediated by protein/ protein interaction with additional factors and/or RNA polymerase itself ( reviewed in Lewin , 1990 ) .
The DNA constructions tested by us include combinations of the Ig kappa promoter with Ig kappa and Ig heavy chain enhancers , and of the SV40 early promoter with its enhancer .
None of them shows preferential activity .
Not : ably , we do not see particularly high gene expression when the immunoglobulin kappa enhancer ( or the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ) is used to activate a kappa gene promoter .
Meyer and Neuberger ( 1989 ) have also found weak activity of the kappa intron enhancer with a B-globin promoter , and they pointed out the existence of a second , stronger kappa gene enhancer far downstream of the constant region which was required for strong ac-tivation .
However , the Ig kappa promoter/intron enhancer combination was previously reported No evidence for enhancer/promoter preference to be preferentially active ( Garcia et al .
, 1986 ) .
The difference between our results and those of Garcia et al .
could be due to differences in the particular DNA constructs or B cell lines used .
Some data on the expression of the herpes virus thymidine kinase gene ( Parslow et al .
, 1987 ) and the alcohol dehydrogenase gene in Drosophila ( Fischer and Maniatis , 1988 ) can be explained by selective enhancer/promoter interaction .
Re-cently , Vincent et al .
( 1990 ) have inserted multiple copies of a synthetic binding site for the `` engrailed `` protein upstream of different promoters .
These combinations have a more restricted and specific ability to enhance transcription when assayed in transgenic fly embryos as compared to a more permissive enhancer/promoter interaction in transiently transfected tissue culture cells .
Nevertheless , others have selected for a great variety of stage-and cell type-specific enhancers in Drosophila by using one common promoter ( Bellen et al .
, 1989 ; Wilson et al .
, 1989 ) .
Even though only one promoter was tested , these data are also compatible with a permissive enhancer/promoter interaction .
Evolution by enhancer shuffling ?
There could well be cases of preferential enhancer/promoter interaction .
Even subtle differences in responsiveness could be important during embryogenesis , when gene dosage appears to be most critical .
Nevertheless , our data with quantitative transcription mapping in transfected B cell lines imply that generally a given promoter can respond to any enhancer ( assuming , of course , that they are active at all in the particular cell type ) .
This raises the question of the possible biological consequence ( s ) of this phenomenon .
One might argue that all enhancers and promoters are channeling their actions through some common element , eg .
, RNA polymerase II , and therefore can not diverge from a ubiquitous function .
However , in procaryotes there is strong selectivity : operators in upstream and promoter-proximal positions must bind the same factor to interact via DNA looping ( for the ara operon , see Lobell and Schleif , 1990 ; for the lac operon , see Kramer et al .
, 1987 ) .
If in eukaryotes a particular enhancer is able to activate almost any promoter brought under its domain of influence , we speculate that this may facilitate the generation of new regulatory pathways , thus accelerating ev-olution .
We also note a possible similarity of 79 this phenomenon to the so-called exon shuffling ( Gilbert , 1978 ) , in which a compatibility of heterologous 5 and 3 ' splice sites makes possible the production of new combinations of protein domains , as a result of translocation events .
In the realm of transcription , multiple enhancers controlling the same gene may have been acquired by enhancer shuffling .
For example , expression of the alpha fetoprotein gene in multiple cell types is governed by three separate enhancers spread over a sequence of 4 kb ( Camper and Tilghman , 1989 ) .
In Drosophila embryos , separate DNA regions control expression in ecto/mesoderm and neural precursors cells ( Hiromi and Gehring , 1987 ; Pick et al .
, 1990 ) .
Another possible example is lysozyme , an antibacterial enzyme , produced in chicken macrophages and also deposited in enormous quantities in egg white .
Expression in macrophages and in oviduct cells is controlled by separate enhancers with a common promoter ( Thei-sen et al .
, 1986 ; Steiner et al .
, 1987 ) .
It is also interesting to note that in different animal classes , various proteins such as lactate dehydro-genase , enolase , and a small heat shock protein have been recruited to become the major lens crystallin proteins ( De Jong et al .
1989 ) .
One explanation for this new function could be a translocation event involving the particular gene and a lens cell-specific enhancer .
In special cases , however , such mixing and matching phenomena may have adverse effects , resulting in ectopic expression of a proto-oncogene and thus contributing to malignant transformation ( reviewed in Lang and Spandidos , 1988 ) .
Reprogramming of genes during evolution may happen frequently in many organisms , including Drosophila , where the spacer DNA between genes contains a great variety of enhancers with particular temporal and cell type specificities ( Wilson et al .
, 1989 ; Bellen et al .
, 1989 ) .
Thus , in higher eukaryotes the most convenient way to extend or restrict the specificity of a given gene may be by adding or deleting remote enhancer sequences .
