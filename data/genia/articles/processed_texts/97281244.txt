Immunology 1997 90 236-243 The tumour associated cell surface antigen A6H is costimulatory for human CD4 * but not CD8 * T cells T. LABUDA , * E. PARRA , * G. HEDLUND , *t T. KALLAND*® & M. DOHLSTEN*t *Department of Tumour Immunology , The Wallenberg Laboratory , University of Lund , Sweden , and { Pharmacia & Upjohn , Inc. , Lund , Sweden SUMMARY The A6H monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) recognizes a 120 000-140 000 MW antigen that is expressed at similar densities on 85-90 % of human CD4* and CD8 * T cells and on renal cell carcinomas .
The binding of the A6H mAb induced a costimulatory signal in anti-CD3 activated T cells .
In the present report , we show that A6H costimulated cell proliferation and cytokine production in purified CD4* T cells Unexpectedly , the CD8* T-cell subpopulation failed to respond .
CD4* T cells costimulated with the A6H mAb upregulated CD80 , CD86 , CD71 , interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) R « , IL-2RB and IL-2Ry , while no corresponding up-regulation of these cell surface molecules was seen in CD8 * T cells .
In order to investigate the nature of the A6H mAb costimulus at the transcriptional level we have examined induction of the transcription factors OCT -1 , AP-1 and NF- « xB which are known to be transcriptional regulators of several cytokine and cytokine receptor genes , including the IL-2 and IL-2R genes .
Co-ligation of the A6H antigen and the CD3 complex induced expression of the transcription factor AP-1 in CD4 * T cells , whereas no increase in NF-xB and octamer-binding ( Oct ) proteins was seen compared to T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 alone .
Furthermore , no induction of AP-1 was seen in A6H costimulated CD8 * T cells .
These results suggests that both proximal steps in CD # 8 # * T-cell activation as well as the later phases are unresponsive to A6H ligation .
Molecular differences of the A6H molecule or distinct regulation of the A6H transduced AP-1 activation pathway may exist in CD4* and CD8 * T cell subpopulations .
INTRODUCTION Activation of T cells to proliferation and cytokine production requires at least two signals .
The first signal is delivered to the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) by antigen in the context of major histocompatability complex ( MHC ) while the second signal is provided by costimulatory receptor ligand interactions .
'~ `` In the absence of proper costimulatory signals engagement of the TCR leads to clonal inactivation , or anergy of the T cells . ``
A number of molecules including B7 , intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) , lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 ( LFA-3 ) and vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) have been shown to provide costimulation to T cells upon ligation of their corresponding receptors CD28 , LFA-1 , CD2 and very late antigen-4 ( VLA-4 ) , respectively . ``

LFA-1 , CD2 and VLA-4 are expressed , at variable density , on a majority of T cells wheras CD28 is expressed on virtually all CD4* and CD8 * T cells . ``
We have recently reported the existence of the A6H antigen , a novel costimulatory molecule co-expressed on T cells and renal cell carcinomas .
'* `` `` The AGH monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) detected a 120000-140000 MW molecule expressed at equally high densities on 88 % of CD4* and 84 % of CD8* T cells . ``
Engagement of the A6H antigen induced T-cell proliferation and cytokine production in CD3 triggered human T cells .
A6H costimulation was clearly distinct from the profile obtained by costimulation through CD28 .
Costimulation with A6H resulted in delayed activation with production of high levels of interferon-y ( IFN-y ) , tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) and moderate amounts of IL-2 . ``
In contrast , CD28 costimulation supported a rapid activation and super-induced IL-2 production .
In the present study we have investigated the role of A6H costimulation in CD4* and CD8* subsets of human T cells .
A6H mAb induced cytokine production and up-regulation of IL-2R « , # and y-chains , CD71 , B7-1 and B7-2 in CD4 * T cells .
However , to our surprise A6H mAb failed to costimulate the CD8 * T cells .
A vital checkpoint for the control of T-cell activation versus inactivation involves the transcription of the IL-2 gene . ``
©1997 Blackwell Science Ltd Costimulatory effects of A6H on human T cells 237 Regulation of the IL-2 enhancer/promoter region is controlled by several transcription factors including octamer-binding ( Oct ) proteins NF-AT , NF-xB , AP-1 and the CD28 responsive complex ( CD28RC ) , all binding to distinct elements in a 300 bp region 5° of the transcription start site . ``
'' Among these transcription factors AP-1 and NF-xB seem to be of particular relevance since they are involved in the induction of several cytokine genes and also complex with other transcription factors such as OCT , NF-AT and CD28RC .
'*~ ' `` In the present report we show that A6H costimulation of CD4* T cells induced high levels of AP-1 binding protein but failed to upregulate NF-xB binding proteins .
The results suggest that the A6H antigen represent a unique pathway for selective induction of AP-1 responding cytokines and cytokine receptor genes in CD4 * T cells .

RESULTS A6H costimulates proliferation of CD4* but not CD8 * T cells Purified human CD4* T cells stimulated with OKT-3/A6H beads showed a strong proliferative response reaching peak levels at day 5 of stimulation .
( Fig .
la ) .
Surprisingly , CD8 * T cells did not respond to A6H costimulation ( Fig .
1b ) .
In contrast , both CD4* and CD8* T cells showed a profound proliferative response after 3 days of culture when stimulated with OKT-3/anti-CD28 beads ( Fig .
la and b ) .
Effect of IL-2 on T-cell subsets costimulated with A6H We reported earlier that OKT-3/A6H induced activation of unfractionated CD3 * T cells resulted in increased cell size and up-regulation of the IL-2R « chain in both CD4* and CD8 * subsets . ``
These results together with the fact that no proliferative response was seen in purified CDS* T cells costimulated with A6H mAb ( Fig .
lb ) , suggests that when unseparated CD3+* T cells are costimulated with A6H mAb , the CD8 * subpopulation may receive growth factors supplied by activated CD4* T cells We therefore examined the role of the IL-2R pathway in activation of purified T-cell subpopula-tions triggered with anti-CD3 mAb and costimulated with A6H mAb .
Addition of recombinant IL-2 to anti-CD3 stimulated CD4* or CD8* T cells induced T-cell proliferation and no additional effect was seen with A6H or CD28-costimulation ( Fig .
2a and b ) .
Upregulation of surface markers on T cells costimulated with mAb A6H To investigate the regulation of cell surface activation markers , in purified CD4* or CD8 * T cells , we analysed expression of the IL-2R chains , CD71 and B7 after A6H or CD28 costimula- - & - A6H -6- CD28 ~ - # - C215 “ é 807 ( a ) 8071 ( b ) x € 60 60 a 2 40 40 .

CD4* T cells costimulated with A6H expressed high amounts of IL-2R # , - $ , -y and CD71 which reached similar levels as CD28 costimulated CD4* T cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Inter-estingly , CD4 * T cells costimulated with A6H showed a higher intensity of B7.1 and B7.2 molecules compared to T cells costimulated with anti-CD28 .
In contrast , no up-regulation of these surface markers was seen on A6H costimulated CD8 * T cells ( data not shown ) .
The B7/CD28 pathway is not contributing to A6H costimulation of CD4 * T cells To investigate whether the late proliferative response of A6H-costimulated T cells was secondary to B7 up-regulation on the T cells themselves , we added CTLA-4 immunoglobulin to block the CD28/B7 pathway .
CTLA-4 immunoglobulin efficiently blocked proliferation of T cells costimulated with B7 transfectants but did not influence the proliferative response in A6H costimulated T cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
Expression of AP-1 and NF-B transcription factors in A6H costimulated cells The AP-1 and NF-xB family of transcription factors participate in the regulation of a number of immune response genes including the IL-2 and IL-2R promoter .
`` `` * * To address whether the differences in proliferation and cytokine production seen in A6H versus CD28 costimulated T cells reflected distinct expression of the AP-l and NF-xB transcription factors , we used a gel shift assay and AP- !
l and NF-kB consensus oligonucleotides .
Resting CD4* T cells contained minimal amounts of AP-1 and NF-xB binding proteins in the nuclear extracts ( Fig .
5 ) .
Low levels of AP-l and NF- « B binding proteins were induced in anti-CD3 stimulated CD4* T cells ( Fig .
Sa , b , d and e ) and the amount of AP-1 binding proteins was substantially increased in A6H-costimu-lated cells after 1 or 3 days of stimulation ( Fig .
Sa and d ) .
In contrast , A6H costimulation had no additional effect on NF-xB compared to anti-CD3 stimulation alone ( Fig .
5b and e ) .
Strong induction of both AP-1 and NF-xB binding proteins was seen in CD28 costimulated cells .

performed competition experiments with unlabelled oligonucleotides .
AP-1 binding activity in nuclear extracts from CD4 positive T cells , costimulated with A6H , was completely blocked by a 50-fold excess of unlabelled AP-1 but was not competed by excess of unlabelled NF-xB ( Fig .
6a ) .
Similarly , the NF- « B binding was specifically competed by unlabelled NF-xB but not by unlabelled AP-1 ( Fig .
6b ) .
Characterization of AP-1 and NF-xB protein components in costimulated CD4 * T cells To compare the composition of the AP-1 and NF-xB binding complexes in A6H and CD28 costimulated CD4* T cells , we performed supershift assay with antibodies against various AP-1 family members ( c-Fos , Fra-1 , Fra-2 , Jun-D , Jun-B and c-Jun ) and Rel family members ( p50 , p65 and c-Rel ) .
The AP-1 binding complex in CD4 * T cells costimulated with A6H was partially blocked by antibodies against Fra-2 , Jun-D , Jun-B and c-Jun ( Fig .
7a ) .
The AP-1 complex in CD28 costimulated T cells contained these Fos/Jun proteins as well as Fra-l ( Fig .
7b ) .
Furthermore , all AP-l DNA binding complexes seemed to contain at least one Fos family member , since antibodies recognizing all members of the Fos family completely blocked the AP-1 complex ( Fig .
7a and b ) .
Supershift of the NF-xB complex in A6H or CD28 costimulated CD4 * T cells indicated that a major part of the complex contained pS50-p50 homodimers , since it was shifted and blocked by anti-p50 antibodies .
Part of the NF- « xB complex in A6H and CD28 costimulated T cells contained c-Rel , whereas only an marginal effect was seen with p65 antibodies ( Fig .
7¢ and d ) .
The antibodies used were functional since we have shown that they efficiently supershift or block the binding of nuclear extracts from superantigen ( sAg ) -stimulated T cells to the AP-1 or NF- « B element , respectively . ``
The effect of the antibodies was specific since no direct binding to the probe was seen and no influence on the gelshift of an irrelevant nuclear complex was recorded ( data not shown ) .

Inability of A6H mAb to induce AP-1 activity in CD8 * T cells To investigate whether the failure of A6H mAb to induce CD8* T-cell proliferation was due to an inability to mobilize the AP-1 nuclear factor , we performed gelshift on nuclear extracts from purified CD8* T cells .
No induction of AP-1 was seen in CD8* T cells costimulated with A6H mAb ( Fig .
8a ) .
In contrast , A6H costimulated CD4* T cells contained substantial amounts of AP-1 binding proteins .
Low levels of NF-kB binding protein were induced in the CD8 * T cells stimulated with OKT-3 alone and no additional effect was seen with A6H costimulation ( Fig .
8b ) In contrast , CD28 costimulation induced similar amounts of AP-1 binding proteins in both the CD4* and CD8 * T cells ( Fig .

The amount of OCT-1 binding protein present in the CD8* and CD4 * T cell populations , respectively , was similar irrespective of the stimuli used ( Fig .

DISCUSSION A6H mAb recognizes an antigen that is expressed on 85-90 % of CD4* and CD8* T cells as well as on certain carcinoma cells .
In the present study we show that binding of A6H mAb results in proliferation of CD3 triggered CD4* T cells .
Unexpectedly , no proliferative response was observed in the CD8 * T-cell population .
In contrast to A6H , no previously described costimulatory molecule expressed at similar densities on both CD4* and CD8 # * T cells have been shown to be costimulatory for only one subset .
This includes CD28 , LFA-1 , CD2 and VLA-4 which are expressed on all or a majority of Tcells* `` `` and are costimulatory for both CD4* and CD8 * T cells . ``
Costimulation of CD4 * T cells with A6H resulted in strong up-regulation of IL-2R a , - # and -y chains whereas no IL-2R expression was seen in CD8 * T cells after A6H costimulation , showing that A6H costimulation is sufficient to induce all chains of the high affinity IL-2R on CD4* T cells .
CD4* or CD8 * T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb alone expressed only marginal amounts of the IL-2R chains and failed to proliferate .
However , the addition of rIL-2 was sufficient to induce responsiveness in both CD4* and CD8* T cells We ©1997 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 90 , 236-243 Costimulatory effects of A6H on human T cells 241 Free oligo- [ > Free oligo - > Po A % Q ® 8 d C .S `` « « C C COW 8 & S « & Q ‘ OVO ( y o & 28 ¢ $ 52 3° * * O « C w @ $ `` & & Q ’ b Super shift - > NF-kB - > Free oligo - > ( d ) Super shift - > NF-xB - > Free oligo- > Figure 7 .

©1997 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 90 , 236-243 have previously reported an increase in IL-2R « expression on both CD4* and CD8 * T cells when unseparated CD3 * T cells were co-stimulated with A6H mAb . ``
However , the present results indicates that the up-regulation of IL-2R « on the CD8* T-cell subpopulation , seen in the previous study , most likely was dependent on paracrine IL-2 production from activated CD4 * T cells .
A6H costimulation of CD4* T cells resulted in the up-regulation of B7 molecules that reached levels somewhat higher than those obtained with CD28 costimulation .
These results suggested a possible role for B7 on T cells as a costimulatory molecule in T-T cell interactions .
However , CTLA-4 immunoglobulin did not block the costimulatory signal induced in A6H cultures , demonstrating that A6H ligation acts via a costimulatory pathway that is independent of the B7-CD28 interaction .
B7-2 ( CD86 ) is constitutively expressed on dendritic cells and B cells and is regarded as the major costimulatory molecule during the initiation of an immune response . ``
'' Yet , little is known about the function of B7 as a costimulatory ligand in T-T cell interactions .
In the case of A6H costimulation , it is possible that up-regulation of B7-1 and 2 on the T cells may occur when primary activated T cells are in a refractory phase and therefore are unable to respond .
The presence of B7 on these cells may , however , participate in costimulation during a secondary immune response .
The cytokine profile after A6H costimulation included moderate levels of IL-2 production in CD4 * T cells . ``
In contrast , no proliferation or IL-2 production was seen in A6H costimulated CD8 * T cells .
Several studies have shown that the production of IL-2 is regulated mainly at the transcrip- 242 T. Labuda et al .
tional level and regulation of the IL-2 enhancer/promoter region is a critical step in control of T-cell growth .
'~ `` The 300 bp region upstream of the transcription start site of the IL-2 enhancer/promoter contain binding motifs for Oct-1 , NF-xB , AP-1 and NF-AT transcription factors .
'* `` ' The AP-1 and NF- « xB transcription factors have been shown to be involved in the regulation of a variety of genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses including IL-2 , IL-2R , TNF and c-myc.26 * Costimulation with A6H induced large amounts of the transcription factor AP-1 but did not affect NF- « xB levels .
Furthermore , induction of AP-1 required costimulation at the early time points but was induced at low levels with anti-CD3 stimulation alone at later time points studied .
However , A6H costimulation augmented induction of AP-1 at all studied time points .
CD3 stimulation alone was sufficient for induction of substantial amounts of NF-kB during the early phase of the response .
The induction was not further increased by A6H costimulation , whereas CD28 costimulation induced a prominent increase in NF-xB binding protein .
This is consistent with earlier studies suggesting that signal 1 is sufficient for induction of NF-xB whereas induction of AP-1 requires costimulation during the early phase of an immune response .
`` ** > Supershift analysis revealed minor differences in the composition of the AP-1 complex in A6H and CD28 costimulated T cells .
CD4 * T cells contained Fra-2 , Jun-D , Jun-B and c-Jun proteins whereas CD28 costimulation induced an additional protein , Fra-1 .
These results indicate that the composition of the AP-1 proteins may change depending on the stimuli used to activate the T cells .
Furthermore , the majority of the AP-1 binding proteins seemed to exist as Fos-Jun heterodimers and not as Jun-Jun homodimers since antibodies against pan-Fos proteins abrogated all DNA binding activity regardless of the costimulatory pathway ( e.g .
CD28 or A6H costimulation ) .
This is in agreement with earlier results revealing that the dimerization affinities of Fos-Jun heterodimers are much higher than those of Jun-Jun homodimers and heterodimers promotes more effective DNA binding and transactivating properties.3435 4 The composition of the NF-xB complex after A6H or CD28 costimulation of CD4* T cells was similar .
A major part contained p50-p50 homodimers and moderate amounts of c-rel and low amounts of p65 were present .
These results indicate that observed quantitative differences in NF-xB expression may be related to the increased ability of CD28 compared to A6H to induce IL-2 production .
Indeed , earlier studies show an increased NF-kB binding activity after engagement of the CD28 receptor by either CD28 mAb or the B7 native ligand suggesting that augmented NF-xB binding activity in T cells is a hallmark for the CD28 mediated costimulatory pathway.2*203° CD8* T cells costimulated with A6H failed to respond and upregulate the activation markers IL-2R4 , $ , y , CD71 and B7 , to produce cytokines and proliferate .
Furthermore , no induction of AP-1 binding protein was seen in CD8 * T cells costimulated with A6H mAb .
This indicated failure of the A6H pathway to induce early as well as late events in the activation cascade in CD8 * T cells .
The inability of the A6H molecule to mount a costimulatory response in CD8 * T cells may reflect structural differences in the A6H molecule in CD8 * compared to CD4 * T cells .
Alternatively , the molecules required for downstream mobilization of AP-1 protein are active/present in CD4* but not in CD8 * T cells We are in favour of the latter hypothesis and are therefore currently investigating the pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced after triggering the A6H molecule in conjunction with anti-CD3 mAb .
Indeed , a number of specific substrates was rapidly tyrosine phoshorylated after A6H costimulation in CD3* T cells , including proteins of 148 000 , 70000 , 56000 , 46000 and 38 000 MW , data not shown .
Nevertheless , it remains to be seen whether there is a difference in the pattern of tyrosine phoshorylation in CD4+ - compared to CD8 * T cells , costimulated with the A6H mAb .
