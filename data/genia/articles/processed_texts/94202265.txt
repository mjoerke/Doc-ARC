We have investigated the antigenic specificity of 47 HSV-specific CD4* T-cell clones recovered from the HSV-2 buttock and thigh lesions of five patients .
Clones with proliferative responses to recombinant truncated glycoprotein B ( gB ) or gD of HSV-2 or purified natural gC of HSV-2 comprised a minority of the total number of HSV-specific clones isolated from lesions .
The gC2- and gD2-specific CD4* clones had cytotoxic activity .
The approximate locations of the HSV-2 genes encoding HSV-2 type-specific CD4* antigens have been determined by using HSV-1 X HSV-2 intertypic recombinant virus and include the approximate map regions 0.30 to 0.46 , 0.59 to 0.67 , 0.67 to 0.73 , and 0.82 to 1.0 map units .
The antigenic specificity of an HLA DQ2-restricted , HSV-2 type-specific T-cell clone was mapped to amino acids 425 to 444 of VP16 of HSV-2 by sequential use of an intertypic recombinant virus containing VP16 of HSV-2 in an HSV-1 background , recombinant VP16 fusion proteins , and synthetic peptides .
Each of the remaining four patients also yielded at least one type-specific T-cell clone reactive with an HSV-2 epitope mapping to approximately 0.67 to 0.73 map units .
The antigenic specificities of lesion-derived CD4* T-cell clones are quite diverse and include at least 10 epitopes .
Human T-cell clones reactive with gC and VP16 are reported here for the first time .
Recurrent herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection in humans is a localized cutaneous disease in individuals with intact cellular immunity .
The roles of infiltrating cells in host defense are incompletely understood .
The cellular infiltrate is enriched for CD4* cells during early stages of lesion formation ( 13 ) .
In murine models of HSV infection , adoptively transferred bulk ( 28 ) or cloned ( 24 ) CD4* T cells can protect against viral challenge .
Keratinocytes , the predominant infected cell type in HSV skin lesions , are capable of presenting HSV antigen to CD4* T cells after gamma interferon treatment ( 12 ) .
Functional roles of lesion-infiltrating CD4* T cells in recurrent HSV lesions may include lymphokine release , inhibition of viral replication , cytotoxicity , and B-cell help ( 48-50 ) .
The antigens recognized by human HSV-specific CD4* T cells have not been fully characterized .
The membrane glycoproteins B , C , and D ( gB , gC , and gD ) stimulate proliferation of T lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) of HSV-seropositive individuals ( 43 , 52 ) .
Secondary in vitro stimulation of PBMC with HSV antigen has been required to expand and enrich HSV-specific T cells prior to derivation of HSV -specific T-cell clones ( 51 ) .
A large proportion of the T-cell clones isolated and maintained by periodic restimulation with whole HSV antigen were reactive with gB or gD ( 52 ) , and a substantial proportion of these clones also had cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) activity ( 48 ) .
It is not known whether secondary in vitro stimulation with crude viral antigen influences the relative proportions of resultant clones reactive * Corresponding author .

2803 with specific HSV proteins or displaying CTL or other effector functions .
CD4* T cells recognize primarily exogenously synthesized antigen after processing by appropriate antigen-processing cells ( 7 ) .
Abundant virion proteins are thus candidates for CD4* T-cell antigens .
Strong serum antibody responses to viral glycoproteins and the abundant tegument protein VP16 are present in human HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections ( 1 ) , consistent with the presence of a CD4* helper T-cell response .
However , the presence of a human CD4* response to VP16 has not been previously demonstrated .
We have recently developed techniques for isolating HSV-specific CD4* T-cell clones from recurrent human HSV lesions ( 23 ) .
We report here the identification of the antigens recognized by a subset of these T-cell clones and the mapping of additional HSV-2 type-specific CD4* T-cell antigens with the use of HSV-1 x HSV-2 intertypic recombinant viruses ( IRV ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Viruses .
HSV-2 strain 333 ( 22 ) and HSV-1 strain E115 ( 40 ) were used throughout unless otherwise specified .
HSV-1 % HSV-2 IRV RH1G7 , RS1G25 , RS1G31 , and R7015 ( 31 , 32 ) were the kind gift of Bernard Roizman , .
HSV-1 strain MP801-1 , expressing the gene for gC of HSV-2 , and HSV-2 strain GpS1 , containing a deletion of gC , were the kind gift of Patricia Spear ( 53 ) .
An IRV ( designated RP-2 ) bearing the VP16 gene from HSV-2 ( strain HG52 ) in the HSV-1 ( KOS ) genome was constructed by complementation of the VP16-deleted virus SMA ( 45 ) .
The HSV-2 fragment includes the entire VP16 open reading frame with 30 bp of 5 flanking sequence and 43 bp of 3 ' flanking sequence .
2804 KOELLE ET AL .
Virus stocks were prepared by infecting HDF cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.001 to 0.01 or 1.0 ( strain RP-2 only ) and allowing the infection to progress until cytopathic effect involved 80 to 100 % of the cells .
Scraped cells were sonicated and then centrifuged at 400 x g for 10 min after addition of 2 ml of minimal essential medium-10 % fetal calf serum per original 150-cm* flask of HDF cells .
Supernatant was frozen in aliquots , and virus titers were determined by a plaque assay on Vero cells ( 37 ) .
Titers ranged from 10 `` to 3 x 10° PFU/ml .
Mock virus preparations were made from the same batch of HDF .
Recombinant vaccinia viruses containing the genes for gB and gD of HSV-2 ( 42 ) and wild-type vaccinia virus New York were grown on HDF and prepared in the same fashion as HSV strains , and titers were determined by a plaque assay on BHK-21 cells ( 37 ) .
Cell lines .
PBMC were prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved for use as antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) .
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lym-phoblastoid cell lines ( LCL ) were prepared from PBMC as described previously ( 42 ) and maintained in RPMI-FC ( RPMI 1640 , 25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ] , 2 mM L-glutamine , 50 pug of streptomycin per ml , 50 U of penicillin per ml , 2 x 10~° M B-mercaptoethanol , 1 mM pyruvate , 10 % fetal calf serum ) .
HDF cells ( 37 ) were maintained in minimal essential medium-10 % fetal calf serum .
Cells used for preparation of viral stocks and functional assays were negative for mycoplasma ( Mycotect ; GIBCO , Grand Island , N.Y. ) .
T-lymphocyte culture .
Lymphocytes recovered from swabs or biopsies of culture-positive HSV-2 lesions were cloned by using a high efficiency procedure with phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) and interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) ( 27 ) as previously described ( 23 ) .
Briefly , vesicle fluid and scraped cells from vesicle bases , or cells recovered from 3-mm skin biopsies minced with scissors and expressed through a 190-wm-pore-size sieve ( Cel-lector ; Bellco Glass , Inc. , Vineland , N.J. ) , were underlaid with an equal volume of Ficoll-Hypaque .
Cells were recovered from the interface after centrifugation at 400 % g for 30 min at room temperature .
These cells were 90 to 95 % polymorphonuclear leukocytes , with occasional eosinophils and monocytes , 1 % or less small round mononuclear cells , and 5 to 10 % epithelial cells with or without multiple nuclei or inclusions .
The cells were plated at 10 to 200 cells per well in T-cell medium ( RPMI 1640 containing 25 mM HEPES , 2 mM L-glutamine , 50 pug of streptomycin per mi , 50 U of penicillin per ml , and 10 % human blood type AB* serum ) and stimulated with PHA , allogeneic irradiated PBMC as feeder cells , and 20 to 50 U of IL-2 ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , N.J. ) per ml .
Acyclovir ( 50 mM ) was included for the first 2 weeks to inhibit HSV replication .
Between 7.9 and 48.7 % of wells were positive for growth by microscopic examination .
Clones were periodically restimu-lated with PHA , allogeneic feeder cells , and IL-2 ( 42 ) .
Subclones were derived at one cell per well ( 27 ) .
In addition , cells ( 4.2 x 10° ) recovered from swabs from patient 1 , lesion A , were stimulated in bulk with 10° allogeneic irradiated ( 3,300 rads of gamma irradiation ) PBMC and 0.4 ug of PHA-P ( Murex Diagnostics Ltd. , Dartford , England ) per ml in 2 ml of T-cell medium plus 50 mM acyclovir in a 1.88-em* well .
After 48 h , 1 ml of medium was exchanged for medium containing 50 U of IL-2 per ml .
Cells were split as necessary and fed with T-cell medium containing 50 U of IL-2 per ml .
Clones were derived after 19 days of growth by plating the cells at one cell per well with allogeneic irradiated PBMC , PHA , and IL-2 ( 27 ) .
Proliferation assays .
Screening assays for lesion-derived T-cell clones were performed in duplicate as described previ- J. ViroL .
ously ( 23 ) .
Cloned T cells or bulk lesion-derived cells ( 10* per well ) and antigen were added to a final volume of 200 wl of T-cell medium in 96-well U-bottom Elates .
Autologous gam-ma-irradiated ( 3,300 rads ) PBMC ( 10° per well ) were included as APC .
After 3 days , [ ' H thymidine ( 1 pCi per well ) was added for 18 h ; cells were harvested with a semiautomated harvester and counted by liquid scintillation .
All subsequent assays were performed in triplicate .
Clones were judged to be specific for HSV strains or purified antigens if the stimulation index ( cpm of [ *H ) thymidine incorporation for HSV strain or antigen/cpm of [ H ] thymidine incorporation for mock HDF antigen ) was greater than 4.0 .
Stimulation indices are reported with two significant figures to reflect the precision of the experimental measurements .
For experiments with allogeneic APC , proliferation in response to both mock and HSV antigens was measured with allogeneic irradiated PBMC , and stimulation indices were calculated from these two measurements .
Antibody blocking of proliferation .
Monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) L243 ( 38 ) , B7/21 ( 35 ) , and SPV-L3 ( 39 ) recognize HLA DR , DP , and DQ framework determinants , respectively .
Supernatant of L243 cells , obtained from the American Type Culture Collection , was used at 1:4 ( final dilution ) .
Purified B7/21 , obtained from Tom Cotner , was used at 1:400 ( final dilution ) .
Purified SPV-L3 , obtained from Hans Yssel , was used at 10 pg/ml ( final concentration ) .
These concentrations were determined in preliminary titration experiments to inhibit proliferation of CD4* T-cell clones restricted by the relevant HLA class II loci by greater than 80 % and to inhibit proliferation of T-cell clones restricted at irrelevant HLA class II loci by less than 15 % .
Antigens .
Antigens were prepared from viral stocks by exposure to UV light for 30 min at 10 cm from a new GTO38 bulb , eliminating infectious virus .
Antigens were routinely used in lymphoproliferation assays at 1:100 ( final dilution ) , corresponding to 10° to 10 ' PFU/ml prior to UV treatment .
Recombinant gB and gD of HSV-2 were purified from trans-fected Chinese hamster ovary cells ( 8 ) .
gB2 is truncated at amino acid 696 , and gD2 is truncated at amino acid 302 .
Recombinant glycoproteins were used at 2 pg/ml ( final con-centration ) ( 52 ) .
gC of HSV-2 was obtained by affinity chromatography of infected cells ( 43 ) and used at 2 pg/ml ( final concentration ) .
Fusion proteins containing the DNA-binding domain of the yeast protein GALA ( amino acids 1 to 147 ) and the activation domains of VP16 ( amino acids 413 to 490 or 402 to 490 for HSV-1 [ 36 ] ) and HSV-2 , respectively , were purified from Escherichia coli to greater than 95 % homogeneity by selective precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography ( 37a ) .
Peptides corresponding to amino acids 400 to 490 of VP16 of HSV-2 , 15 amino acids long and overlapping by 10 amino acids ( Chiron Mimotopes , Clayton , Australia ) , were dissolved in 20 % acetonitrile-0.1 M acetic acid at 2.0 mg/ml and used at 10 pg/ml ( final concentration ) .
Cytotoxicity assays .
Target LCL were infected for 18 h with HSV or vaccinia viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5 , loaded with °'Cr , and washed as previously described ( 42 ) .
Cloned lymphocytes were plated in 100 pl of RPMI-FC in 96-well U-bottom plates , and targets ( 5 x 10° per well ) added in 100 pl of RPMI-FC .
After 4 h at 37°C , the plates were centrifuged at 50 x g for 2 min , and 100 pl of supernatant was counted with a gamma counter .
Allogeneic target cells were mismatched at HLA class I and II loci .
Results are reported as percent specific release , determined as [ ( mean experimental cpm - mean spontaneous cpm ) / ( mean maximal cpm - mean spontaneous cpm ) ] X 100 .
Spontaneous release was always less than 20 % of total release .

RESULTS Cloning of lesion CD4* HSV-specific T cells .
In this report , we describe the antigenic specificities of 47 lesion-derived HSV-specific CD4* T-cell clones from five patients ( Table 1 ) , representing all of the HSV-specific clones available in sufficient number for detailed study .
A total of 42 HSV-specific CD4* T-cell clones obtained directly from swabs or biopsies of recurrent HSV-2 buttock or thigh lesions were available in sufficient number for detailed studies .
Details of the cloning procedure and reactivity with HSV-1 and HSV-2 antigens have been previously reported for patient 1 , lesion A , and patients 2 , 3 , and 4 ( 23 ) .
In addition , five HSV-2 type-specific CD4* T-cell clones , designated 1A¥.Bx , were obtained by cloning bulk lesion-derived cells from patient 1 , lesion A , after 19 days of bulk culture .
All clones were CD3 # , CD4* , and CD8~ by flow cytometry .
Overall , 26 of 47 ( 55 % ) of the lesion-derived HSV-specific T-cell clones recognized HSV-2 type-specific epitopes .
gB- and gD-specific CD4* T-cell clones .
The HSV-specific CD4* T-cell clones were each tested for reactivity with recombinant truncated gB and gD of HSV-2 .
Three clones from three different patients had stimulation indices of greater than 5.0 with gB2 ( 3B.268 , 4.4D3 , and 5.5 ) , and one clone had a stimulation index of greater than 5.0 with gD2 ( 3B.134 ) ( Table 2 , experiment 1 ) .

The gD2-specific clone 3B.134 also lysed vaccinia virus-gD2- and HSV-2-infected autologous target cells , but not uninfected or wild-type vaccinia virus-infected autologous cells or HSV-2-infected allogeneic cells , in a cytotoxicity assay ( Fig .
1 ) .
The gB2-specific clones did not have cytolytic activity against HSV-2- or vaccinia virus-gB2-infected target cells ( data not shown ) .
All four clones reactive with gB2 or gD2 recognized type-common determinants ( Table 2 , experiment 2 ) .
Subclones of each of the gB- and gD-reactive clones obtained at one cell per well retained the same pattern of reactivity with purified recombinant glycopro-teins , HSV-1 antigens , and HSV-2 antigens ( data not shown ) .
The remaining T-cell clones all had stimulation indices with gB2 and gD2 of less than 3.0 ( data not shown ) .
Epitope mapping using IRV .
Fourteen of the 26 ( 54 % ) HSV-2 type-specific clones displayed stimulation indices of greater than 4.0 to at least one viral antigen prepared from a panel of IRV ( Table 3 ) .
Twelve HSV-2 type-specific T-cell clones did not proliferate in response to antigen prepared from any of the IRV .
Clone 4.3C12 is shown as an example ( Table 3 ) .
All IRV elicited specific proliferative responses from bulk PBMC of HSV-seropositive individuals , demonstrating their antigenicity .
As expected , T-cell clones reactive with type-common epitopes reacted with all IRV .
Clone 1A.2 is shown as an example ( Table 3 ) .
Data for the 20 additional type-common and 11 additional unmappable HSV-2 type-specific T-cell clones are not included in Table 3 .
The T-cell clones all displayed identical patterns of reactivity in at least two assays .
Type-specific T-cell clones recognized diverse HSV-2 antigens .

Clones 1A¥.1 and 1B.9F8 were recovered from lesions from the same patient on opposite buttocks separated in time by 1 year .
One HSV-2 type-specific clone ( 5.19 ) reactive with IRV R7015 ( 32 ) , corresponding to approximately 0.82 to 1.0 map units within the HSV-2 genome , was isolated from patient 5 .
A total of 10 HSV-2 type-specific clones reacted with IRV RS1G25 ( 31 , 32 ) , corresponding to approximately 0.59 to 0.73 map units within the HSV-2 genome .
Of these 10 clones , 8 ( 1A¥.B.25 , 2.3 , 3B.294 , 4.1A11 , 4.2E1 , 4.2F10 , 4.3C3 , and 5.1 ) also reacted with IRV RS1G31 ( 31 ) , indicating specificity for an epitope encoded by HSV-2 between approximately 0.67 and 0.73 map units .
All eight clones reactive with RS1G31 were also reactive with RS1G25 .
Two clones ( 2.1 and 3B.230 ) reacted with antigen prepared from RS1G25 but not RS1G31 , indicating specificity for an antigen encoded by HSV-2 between approximately 0.59 and 0.67 map units .
gC-specific CD4* T-cell clone .
As the gene for gC2 is located at approximately 0.64 map units ( 41 ) , the two clones reactive with RS1G25 but not RS1G31 ( 2.1 and 3B.230 ) were evaluated for proliferative responses to affinity-purified gC2 and special HSV strains ( Table 4 ) .
Clone 3B.230 had a specific proliferative response to gC2 .
This clone also proliferated in response to the recombinant HSV-1 strain MP801-1 , expressing the HSV-2 gC gene , and failed to proliferate in response to the HSV-2 strain GpS1 , which does not express gC2 .
Subclones of 3B.230 obtained at one cell per well displayed an identical pattern of reactivity ( data not shown ) .
Clone 3B.230 was also reactive in cytotoxicity assays with RS1G25 and MP801-1 but not RS1G31 or GpS1 ( Fig .
2 ) , the same pattern of reactivity obtained in proliferation assays .
In contrast , clone 2.1 did not proliferate in response to MP8O01-1 or purified gC2 and did react with the GpS1 , indicating reactivity with a HSV-2 type-specific epitope not contained within gC2 .

Allogeneic PBMC from patient 5 , sharing HLA DR3 and DQ2 with patient 1 , presented HSV-2 antigen to clone 1A¥.B.25.1 ( Table 6 ) .
Alloreactivity against the patient 5 PBMC was not present , as incorporation of [ °H ] thymidine in response to these allogeneic PBMC and mock antigen was less than 500 cpm ( data not shown ) .
Proliferation of clone 1¥.B.25.1 to autologous PBMC and HSV-2 antigen was inhibited more than 90 % by anti-HLA DQ MAb SPV-L3 but not inhibited by anti-HLA DR or anti-HLA DP MAbs ( Table 6 ) , identifying the restriction element as DQ2 .
A fusion protein bearing the activation domain of VP16 of HSV-1 or HSV-2 linked to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GALA protein was purified after expression in E. coli .
Dose-dependent proliferative responses were observed at HSV-2 fusion protein concentrations of between 0.5 and 8 pg/ml ( Fig .
3 ) .
No proliferation was elicited by the HSV-1 fusion protein .
Peptides containing amino acids 425 to 439 ( LRLDGEEVDMTPADA ) and 430 to 444 ( EEVDMTPADALDDFD ) of VP16 of HSV-2 ( 11 ) both induced specific proliferative responses ( Fig .
3 ) .

DISCUSSION Limited information concerning the antigenic specificity of human HSV-specific T lymphocytes is available .
Secondary in vitro restimulation of PBMC with HSV antigen prior to cloning has previously been necessary to obtain CD4* HSV-specific T-cell clones ( 52 ) .
It is not known to what extent the antigenic specificities and effector functions of clones obtained with this method reflect the properties of T lymphocytes that have migrated to , and been activated within , recurrent HSV lesions .
CD4* T-cell clones obtained in this manner have been primarily specific for gB and gD ( 52 ) .
We have used the in situ enrichment of HSV-specific T cells in recurrent HSV-2 lesions ( 23 ) to obtain T cells for cloning without the requirement for in vitro restimulation with HSV antigen .
The T-cell cultures used in this study were believed to be clonal .
It was necessary to initially plate the lesion cells at greater than one cell per well because of the low purity of lymphocytes ( < 1 % ) in the lesion cell preparations .
Since the maximum percentage of wells positive for growth was 48.7 % ( 23 ) , the average number of lymphocytes plated per well is estimated to be less than one ( 20 , 23 ) .
Since approximately 10 % of all lesion-derived T-cell cultures were HSV specific ( 23 ) , it is very unlikely that more than one HSV-specific T-cell clone would be represented within an individual culture of lesion lymphocytes .
All of the cultures tested were > 97 % CD4* and < 3 % CD8* .

clones 1A.B.25 , 2.3 , 3B.134 , 3B.230 , 3B.268 , 4.2E1 , and 4.2F10 , and all were found to retain specific proliferative responses to HSV-2 antigen ( 23 ) .
The antigenic specificity of subclones , as determined by IRV mapping or reactivity with HSV glycopro-teins , has been identical with that of the parent culture in all of 12 clones tested ( data not shown ) .
In addition , no cases of reactivity of HSV-2 type-specific T-cell clones with more than one nonoverlapping IRV were noted ( Table 3 ) .
The lesion CD4* response appears to be directed against a variety of viral epitopes .
Using lesion-derived HSV-specific CD4* T-cell clones from five individuals , we identified at least 10 different epitopes : 1 to 3 , epitopes contained within gB , gC , and gD ; 4 , a type-specific HSV-2 epitope contained within amino acids 425 to 444 of VP16 ; 5 , a type-specific HSV-2 epitope or epitopes mapping to approximately 0.30 to 0.46 map units ; 6 , a type-specific HSV-2 epitope or epitopes mapping to approximately 0.59 to 0.67 map units but not gC ; 7 , a type-specific HSV-2 epitope ( or epitopes ) mapping to approximately 0.67 to 0.73 map units but not VP16 ; 8 , a type-specific HSV-2 epitope ( or epitopes ) mapping to approximately 0.82 to 1.0 map units ; 9 , a type-specific HSV-2 epitope ( or epitopes ) not mappable with the current panel of IRV ; and 10 , a type-common epitope ( or epitopes ) in addition to those present in recombinant soluble gB and gD .
It is of interest that each of the five patients studied yielded at least one lesion-derived HSV-2 type-specific CD4* T-cell clone reactive with a HSV-2 epitope present within IRV RS1G31 and thus mapping to the approximate region of 0.67 to 0.73 map units .
The maximum left-hand border of HSV-2 sequences contained within IRV RS1G31 is defined by the presence of the HSV-1 KpnI-A to -Y `` cleavage site at nucleotide 103101 ( 31 ) , within the HSV-1 UL47 coding sequence ( 26 ) .
The minimum left-hand border of HSV-2 sequences in RS1G31 has been mapped in the present experiments to be within or 5 ' of the DNA encoding amino acids 425 to 444 of VP16 ( UL48 ) of HSV-2 .
The minimum right border of the HSV-2 sequences within RS1G31 is defined by the presence of the HSV-2 EcoRI-L to -H cleavage site ( 31 ) ; this site can not be precisely placed with published sequence information .
The maximal right-hand border of HSV-2 sequences within IRV RS1G31 is defined by the absence of the HSV-2 Bg/II-I to -H cleavage site ( 31 ) .
The crossover point must lie to the left of the 5 ' end of the HSV-2 ULS3 gene , since the HSV Bgi/lII-I to -H cleavage site is not present in the ULS3 coding sequence ( 15 ) or the remaining rightward region of UL of HSV-2 ( 25 , 34 ) .
IRV RS1G31 may , therefore , contain HSV-2 coding sequences for some of ULA7 of HSV-2 , but the HSV-2 sequences do not extend into the coding region of ULS53 of HSV-2 .
Of the total of eight HSV-2 type-specific clones mapping to IRV RS1G31 , only one of six available for testing reacted with IRV RP-2 and was thus specific for the UL48 gene product VP16 .
The 0.67-0.73 region of the HSV-2 genome contains , in addition to VP16 , the genes for the abundant tegument proteins ULA47 and UL49 and the genes for the probable membrane glycoprotein ULA9.5 or ULAIA ( 4 , 5 , 16 , 54 ) .
The UL50 and ULS2 protein products are perhaps less likely candidates for CD4* T-cell antigens , since they are present in small amounts in infected cells ( 30 , 47 ) and have not been identified in virions .
Little is known about the ULS1 gene product of HSV ( 3 ) .
Study of additional HSV-2 lesions and finer definition of the T-cell epitope ( s ) will allow exploration of the possibility that an immunodominant HSV-2 type-specific CD4* antigen may be encoded by a gene in this portion of the genome .
The lesion-derived clone 1A.B.25 is the first published J. Viror .
CD4* T-cell clone reactive with VP16 .
VP16 is an abundant virion tegument protein , present as 400 to 2,000 molecules per virion ( 6 , 29 ) .
Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that preformed virion proteins , rather than endogenously synthesized viral proteins , would be expected to recognized by the CD4* T-cell response ( 7 ) .
The predicted amino acid sequences of VP16 of HSV-1 and HSV-2 are 86 % identical , with maximal divergence in the carboxy-terminal activation subdomain ( 11 ) .
Type-specific T-cell clone 1¥.B.25 is restricted by HLA DQ2 , as determined from data from partially HLA matched allogeneic APC and inhibition of proliferative responses to autologous APC by various anti-HLA class II MAbs ( Table 6 ) .
Inhibition of the proliferative response to allogeneic , HLA DQ2-bearing APC plus antigen by anti-HLA DQ MAb would also be expected ; this confirmatory experiment and identification of further HLA restriction elements of additional T-cell clones are under way .
The naturally processed epitope of VP16 of HSV-2 most likely includes the overlap region , amino acids 430 to 439 , shared by the two antigenic peptides 425 to 439 and 430 to 444 ( Fig .
3 ) .
This overlap region ( EEVDMTPADA ) shares negatively charged amino acids at positions 1 and 9 and alanine at position 8 with positions 2 , 9 , and 10 of the HLA DQ2-restricted peptide IDVWLGGLAE NSLP ( human thyroid peroxidase positions 632 to 645 [ 14 , 21 ] ) .
A low proportion ( 5 of 47 [ 11 % ] ) of lesion-derived CD4* T-cell clones were specific for the abundant membrane glycoprotein gB , gC , or gD .
Several factors may have limited detection of T-cell clones with these specificities .
First , the recombinant gB2 and gD2 molecules used in this study have C-terminal deletions ; the reagents include 79 and 82 % , respectively , of the predicted amino acid sequences of the native proteins after cleavage of N-terminal signal sequences ( 44 , 55 ) .
T-cell clones reactive with whole HSV antigens would be scored as negative for gB2 or gD2 if they were specific for epitopes not included in the recombinant soluble glycopro-teins .
Second , only HSV-2 type-specific T-cell clones reacting with RS1G25 but not RS1G31 antigens were screened for gC2 reactivity ; type-common , gC-specific T-cell clones would be missed by this method .
However , the 31 % divergence between the amino acid sequences of gC1 and gC2 ( 41 ) makes it likely that most T-cell epitopes of HSV gC will be type specific .
Third , the amount of glycoprotein antigen used in proliferation assays may have been suboptimal for some T-cell clones , although a 2-ug/ml concentration of HSV gB , gC , and gD has previously been shown to be optimal for eliciting proliferative responses from bulk PBMC and PBMC-derived CD4* T-cell clones ( 43 , 52 ) .
Even allowing for these potential limiting factors , however , there is still a marked contrast between the previously reported finding that most PBMC-derived HSV-specific CD4* T-cell clones are specific for gB or gD ( 52 ) and the results of the present study with lesion-derived T-cell clones .
The large size of the HSV genome ( 33 ) and the diverse peptides bound to various human HLA class II molecules ( 9 ) lead to the prediction that a large number of human CD4* epitopes are present with HSV-2 .
Considerable diversity was detected among the antigens recognized by CD4* T-cell clones recovered from individual patients .
For example , a minimum of six different specificities were detected for patient 5 : gB2 , at least one HSV-2 type-specific epitope encoded by HSV-2 DNA present within each of the three IRV ( RH1G7 , RS1G31 , and R7015 ) , at least one type-common epitope in addition to gB2 , and at least one HSV-2 type-specific epitope encoded by HSV-2 gene sequence ( s ) not contained within the panel of IRV .
The overall detection of at least 10 T-cell epitopes Vor .
68 , 1994 recognized by lesion-infiltrating HSV-specific CD4* T cells provides a minimum estimate of the diversity of viral epitopes because of the small number of patients studied , the limited availability of purified viral proteins , and , for HSV-2 type-specific T-cell clones , the incomplete coverage and crude mapping of the HSV-2 genome provided by the current panel of IRV .
We plan to combine epitope mapping with additional IRV and determination of individual clonal HLA restriction elements with consensus motifs for HLA class II-binding peptides ( 9 ) and HSV sequence data to define epitopes at the peptide level .
The biological roles of lesion-infiltrating antigen-specific CD4* T cells in the resolution of recurrent HSV-2 lesions are not known .
Patients with deficiencies of CD4* cell function , such as advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection , have delayed and incomplete resolution of recurrent HSV-2 infection ( 46 ) .
In addition to the gC- and gD-specific clones described above , only one additional HLA-restricted , HSV-specific CD4* T-cell clone with CTL activity was detected among the 47 T-cell clones described in this study ( 3/47 = 6 % ) .
In contrast , 30 to 80 % , depending on the donor , of PBMC-derived HSV-specific CD4* T-cell clones obtained with secondary in vitro stimulation have had CTL activity ( 52 ) .
The apparent difference may be related to culture conditions , as progressive increases in apparent CTL activity with in vitro restimulation with antigen have been described for human CD4* clones specific for other viruses ( 17 ) .
Additional potential effector functions include secretion of lymphokines with antiviral or immunomodulatory activity , including gamma interferon ( 18 , 19 ) , and B-cell helper activity ( 49 ) .
Studies of lymphokines produced in situ in HSV lesions and in vitro by HSV-specific CD4* T cells are under way .
In summary , CD4* T cells present within human recurrent HSV-2 lesions recognize a diverse set of type-common and HSV-2 type-specific antigens .
T-cell clones specific for gB and gD have been detected , extending observations with PBMC-derived T-lymphocyte clones .
Human T-cell clones specific for gC and the virion tegument protein VP16 have been detected for the first time , and at least five additional HSV-2 type-specific antigens have been defined by using patterns of reactivity with HSV-1 x HSV-2 IRV .
In one patient for which two recurrent HSV-2 lesions have been studied , a T-cell clone reactive with a HSV-2 type-specific antigen mapping to the same region of the HSV-2 genome ( approximately 0.30 to 0.46 map units ) was recovered from both lesions .
Study of additional lesions and genetic analysis of the T-cell receptor genes of T-cell clones derived from sequential HSV lesions may determine whether clonotypic T cells participate in the host reaction to serial HSV recurrences within an individual pa-tient .
Continued work on the diversity and antigenic specificity of the human CD4* response to HSV may further our understanding of the processes by which the host controls human recurrent herpes simplex infection .
