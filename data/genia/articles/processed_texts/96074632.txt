ManoLaGas* Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism , Center for Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Diseases , University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences , Little Rock , AR 72205 Communicated by H. F. DeLuca , University of Wisconsin , Madison , WI , July 19 , 1995 ABSTRACT The effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; [ 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ] , a steroid hormone with immunomodulating properties , on nuclear factor xB ( NF- « B ) proteins was examined in in vitro activated normal human lymphocytes .
by Western blot analysis .
Over a 72-hr period of activation , the expression of the 50-kDa NF-xB , p50 , and its precursor , p105 , was increased progressively .
When cells were activated in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , the levels of the mature protein as well as its precursor were decreased .
The effect of the hormone on the levels of p50 was demonstrable in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments ; it required between 4 and 8 hr and was specific , as 25-hydroxyvitamin D ; and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; were ineffective .
Besides p50 , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; decreased the levels of another NF-xB protein , namely c-rel .
In addition , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; decreased the abundance of a specific DNA-protein complex formed upon incubation of nuclear extracts from activated lymphocytes with a labeled NF- « B DNA binding motif .
Further , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-B in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with a construct containing four tandem repeats of the NF-B binding sequence of the immunoglobulin x light chain gene linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene .
These observations demonstrate directly that there is de novo synthesis of NF-KB during human lymphocyte activation and suggest that this process is hormonally regulated .
Besides its role in calcium and skeletal homeostasis , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; [ 1,25 ( OH ) ; D3 ] plays a widespread role in the differentiation , proliferation , biosynthetic activity , and function of cells of the immune system ( 1 ) .
Its effects on lymphocytes are mediated by the specific 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; recep-tor , a ligand-dependent transcription factor that recognizes DNA elements in the promoters of its target genes , termed vitamin D response elements ( VDREs ) .
Nonetheless , VDREs are not present in the regulatory sequences of genes influenced by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in lymphocytes .
Further , the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on lymphocytes are pleiotropic and depend on the mode of activation ( 1 ) .
Based on these considerations , we have hypothesized that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; exerts its actions on lymphocyte products through interactions with other factors generated following activation , rather than through direct interaction of its receptor with these genes .
A precedent for modulation of gene expression by a steroid hormone through influencing other transcription factors has been set in the case of the glucocorticoid receptor ( 2 , 3 ) .
Nuclear factor « B ( NF-kB ) designates a family of structurally and functionally related protein complexes used by lymphoid cells to regulate genes encoding products that participate in the immune response ( 4 ) .
All members of the family share a 300-amino acid region of homology that mediates dimerization and high-affinity binding to decameric DNA The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

10990 sequences of the consensus 5-GGGRNNYYCC-3 ' ( where R is purine and Y is pyrimidine ) ( 5 ) .
The ability of NF-KB to bind DNA is controlled by protein-protein interactions with highly specific inhibitor proteins , termed IxB ( 6 ) .
Association with IxB prevents nuclear uptake by retaining NF- « B complexes in the cytoplasm .
Stimulation with various agents causes the release of IxB from the rel-NF- « B complexes , thus allowing the rapid translocation of rel-NF- « B into the nucleus .
The prototypical NF- « B is composed of two distinct subunits of 50 kDa and 65 kDa referred to as p50 and p65 or RelA , respectively .
The p50 subunit is synthesized as a 105-kDa protein , p105 , that undergoes posttranslational processing to the mature form ( 7 , 8 ) .
c-rel , the normal cellular homolog of the oncogene product of the avian reticuloendotheliosis virus REV-T v-rel , is another member of the NF- « B family that is expressed in mammalian cells ( 9 ) .
p50 , c-rel , and p65 are in fact the major components of NF- « B complexes , binding to most of the identified cis-acting « B sites .
All these proteins are expressed in various cells , but most abundantly in differentiated human lymphoid cell lines and human peripheral blood resting B and activated T cells ( 4 , 10 ) .
Though all of them are constitutively expressed , their expression is up-regulated by NF- « B-activated conditions such as those occurring during stimulation of T cells or B cells ( 11 ) .
Control of the activation of preexisting forms of NF- « B has attracted large attention .
However , relatively little is known about the regulation of the level of expression of the various NF- « B proteins themselves .
In this report , we present evidence indicating that during normal T-cell activation in vitro , there is a progressive increase in the levels of p50 , its p105 precursor , and c-rel and that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; acts to down-regulate the levels of these proteins and thereby decrease their transcriptional activity in human lymphocytes .

The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmid , p ( NF- « B ) 4-CAT , was constructed by inserting four tandem copies of the NF- « B binding sequence ( 5'-gatcCAGAGGGGACTTT-TCCGAGA-3 ' ) of the immunoglobulin « light chain gene at a BamHI site upstream of the TATA box of pE1BTATA-CAT ( 14 ) and was provided by Michael Su ( Vertex Pharmaceuticals , Cambridge , MA ) .
Cells and Culture Conditions .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) from normal volunteers or buffy coats were isolated by Ficoll/Hypaque ( 15 ) and stimulated with PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) , with OKT3 ( 1:250 dilution ) , or with other reagents as indicated .
The human T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and anti-biotics .
Preparation of Subcellular Fractions .
At the end of the incubation , cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , resuspended at 4°C in 10 mM TrisHCl , pH 7.4/1.5 mM EDTA/5 mM dithiothreitol/1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) /0.3 M KCI , and sonicated .
Cytosol fractions were obtained by centrifugation for 1 hr at 105,000 x g and precipitated with ammonium sulfate ( 40 % of saturation ) .
Peliets were collected and solubilized in 10 mM TrisHCl , pH 7.4/1.5 mM EDTA/5 mM dithiothreitol/1 mM PMSF .
For the experiments in which we used nuclear extracts ( Fig .
5 ) or nuclear and cytosolic extracts ( Fig .
1 ) , isolation of nuclear fractions was performed as described ( 16 ) .
All buffers contained 0.5 mM PMSF , 1 mg of leupeptin per mi , 0.5 mg of pepstatin per ml , and 1 mg of aprotinin per ml .
Briefly , 46 X 10° cells were washed with hypotonic buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.9/1.5 mM MgCl ; /10 mM KCI/0.5 mM dithio-threitol ) and lysed for 10 min on ice in hypotonic buffer containing 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 ( 30 pl per 10 `` cells ) .
Lysates were centrifuged ( 10,000 x g ) at 4°C for 10 min .
Supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 100,000 % g at 4°C , and the resulting high-speed supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction .
Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 100 pl of lysis buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9/420 mM NaC1/1.5 mM MgC1 ; /0.2 mM EDTA/25 % glycerol ) and incubated at 4°C for 15 min .
Lysed nuclei were dispersed in a Vortex and centrifuged at 10,000 x g , 4°C for 10 min ; supernatants were collected , snap-frozen , and stored at -70°C .
Protein concentrations of nuclear and cytosolic fractions were determined by the method of Bradford ( 17 ) .
Western Blot Analysis .
Protein extracts ( 100 ug per lane ) were electrophoresed on SDS/polyacrylamide ( 7.5 % ) gels ( 18 ) , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies as described ( 15 ) .
Radioactivity of the bands was determined using a B scanner ( AMBIS Systems ) .
Background was subtracted from each lane .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay .
Nuclear extracts from lymphocytes were prepared as described above .
A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-kB binding sequence of the human interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) promoter ( -82 bp to -47 bp , 5S !
-ATCAAATGTGGGATTTTCCCAT-GAGTCTCAATATTA-3 ' ) was end-labeled using [ y- > `` P ] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase .
One nanogram of end-labeled probe was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 5 ug of nuclear protein in a solution containing 50 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) per ml , 50 ug of double-stranded salmon sperm DNA per ml , 6 % glycerol , 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7.5 ) , 80 mM KCI , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM EGTA .
Competition studies were performed by incubating nuclear extracts with unlabeled NF-KB oligonucleotide or a 22-mer oligonucleotide containing an AP-1 binding motif ( 5-CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGG ATC-3 ' ) for 15 min at room temperature ( as indicated in Fig .
Proc .
Natl .

USA 92 ( 1995 ) - 10991 5 ) , followed by a 30-min incubation in the presence of the probe .
Samples were analyzed on native 5 % polyacrylamide gels .
Transfection and CAT Assay .
Jurkat cells ( 1 X 10 `` ) were transfected in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.05 M TrisHCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 0.25 mg of DEAE-dextran per ml ( Phar-macia ) , and 2 ug of either the p ( NF- « B ) , -CAT plasmid or a plasmid containing the CAT gene driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter ( pRSV-CAT ) as a positive control .
After incubation at room temperature for 20 min , transfected cells were diluted with RPMI 1640 medium , pelleted , and resuspended in the same medium containing 10 % FBS .
Cells were maintained in the absence or presence of 10~® M 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ; for 48 hr , stimulated with PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) for the last 8 hr of the 48-hr period , and harvested by centrifugation , and lysates were prepared by three cycles of freeze/thaw in 0.1 M Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) .
CAT enzyme activity was assayed as described ( 19 ) , and values are expressed as percentage of acetylated chlor-amphenicol .
RESULTS Analysis of the expression of NF-KB , prior to and during activation of normal human PBMCs with PHA over a period of 72 hr , was performed using an Ab ( SP1157 ) recognizing the p50 subunit of NF- « B as well as the p105 precursor of this protein ( 13 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
In either the cytosolic or the nuclear fraction , p50 or p105 was undetectable prior to or following 12 hr of activation .
However , following 24 hr of activation , the p50 was detected in both fractions .
Thereafter , its expression increased progressively .
Activation also led to the appearance of the p105 precursor of p50 in the cytosol and the levels of this protein increased progressively during the activation period .
In this particular experiment , the intensity of the p105 signal appeared weaker than that of the p50 ; however , this was not a consistent finding in subsequent experiments .
Addition of 10-8 M 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; simultaneously with addition of PHA caused a significant decrease in the expression of p50 at all time points examined .
A similar effect was observed in the cytosolic and the nuclear fractions .
In addition , 1,25 ( OH ) ; Ds decreased the expression of the p105 precursor of p50 in the cytosolic fraction .
Vitamin D metabolites with lesser potency [ and lower affinity for the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptor ] had no appreciable effects on the level of expression of NF-kB following a 72-hr activation with PHA ( Fig .
2 ) .
Nonetheless , the synthetic glucocorticoid TRM also inhibited NF- « B expression .
In this experiment and that shown in Fig .
3 , as opposed to the data shown in Fig .

Since in each experiment we have utilized PBMCs from a different donor , we think that this apparent difference is probably due to a difference either in the number of already activated ( in vivo ) lymphocytes or in the levels of constitutive expression of these proteins among various subjects .
To determine the time required for 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to exert its inhibitory effect on p50 and p105 , PBMCs were activated for 72 hr with PHA , and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was added either simultaneously with addition of PHA or 24 , 48 , 64 , 68 , or 70 hr following addition of PHA ( Fig .
3 ) .
The inhibiting effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on p50 and p105 was apparent when the hormone was added simultaneously with PHA or 24 , 48 , or 64 hr following addition of PHA .
However , when 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was added into the culture for the last 4 hr ( 68 hr following PHA activation ) or the last 2 hr ( 70 hr following PHA activation ) of the 72-hr culture period , there was no discernible effect .
As shown in Fig .
3 ( lower panel ) , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibited [ } H thy-midine incorporation when it was added into the cultures simultaneously with addition of PHA or 24 hr following the addition of PHA .
Further , we investigated whether the mode of activation of lymphocytes would influence the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on p50/p105 and whether 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; had an effect on the expression of a related protein with NF- « B activity- ( Fig .
4 ) .
Cytosolic preparations from stimulated lymphocytes contained a 75-kDa protein that reacted with an Ab recognizing the extreme C terminus of c-rel ( Ab $ P265 ) as well as the p105 and p50 , in PHA- and OKT3-activated cells .
The levels of all three proteins were decreased in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
Identical results were obtained using an alternative Ab that recognizes the N terminus portion of c-rel ( not shown ) .

Time course analysis of the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D on NF- « B and cell proliferation in PH A-activated human lymphocytes .

At the end of the 72-hr activation , cytosols were prepared by ultracentrifugation , and aliquots ( 100 ug of protein ) were immunoblotted with the SP1157 Ab .
Cell proliferation was assessed by [ H ] thymidine incorporation in triplicate aliquots ( 0.2 X 10° per 0.2 ml of medium ) and was expressed as cpm xX 10-3 .
The hatched bar indicates cell proliferation in PBMCs activated for 72 hr with PHA in the absence of 1,25 ( OH ) : Ds .
Unstimulated lymphocytes used for the PHA activation experiment had no detectable c-rel ; however , small levels of c-rel were present in the preparation used for the OKT3 activation experiment , perhaps reflecting an interindividual variation in the number of in vivo ( or during the isolation procedure ) activated cells , similar to the situation we had observed in the preparations used for the experiments shown in Figs .
1-3 .
In any event , activation by either PHA or OKT3 led to a large increase in the expression of c-rel , as well as the p50 and p105 proteins .

The inhibiting effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on NF- « B expression was confirmed with electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the NF- « B response element ( from the human IL-6 gene promoter ) ( Fig .
5 ) .
Nuclear extracts from resting cells did not contain proteins capable of retarding the consensus NF- « B DNA binding site ( lane 2 ) .
However , nuclear extracts from cells activated with PHA formed a DNA-protein complex that appeared as a single retarded band ( lane 3 ) .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; caused a significant reduction in the DNA-protein complex , as evidenced by the decrease in the intensity of this band ( lane 4 ) .
This complex could be competitively inhibited by an excess of unlabeled NF- « B DNA binding motif ( lanes 5 and 6 ) but not by an excess of a nonspecific oligonucleotide containing an AP-1 binding motif ( lane 7 ) .
.
Finally , to ascertain the functional significance of the inhibiting effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on NF- « B expression , we proceeded to examine whether 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can affect the transcriptional activity of the NF- « B consensus sequence ( Fig .
6 ) .
To do this , we transiently transfected the T-lymphocytic cell line Jurkat [ which expresses the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptor con-stitutively-i.e .
, without the requirement of activation ( 20 ) with a construct containing the CAT gene under the regulatory control of the NF- « B consensus sequence that is present in the immunoglobulin « light chain gene .
Stimulation of the Jurkat cells for 8 hr with PHA resulted in an increase in the NF- « B-driven CAT expression .
In the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , the increase in CAT activity was partially inhibited ( 39 % + 14 % ) .
Similar results ( 41 % + 5 % inhibition as compared to untreated cells ) were obtained in a separate experiment .

DISCUSSION These studies demonstrate that the abundance of p50 , as well as its p105 precursor , and c-rel increase progressively during prolonged lymphocyte activation and that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; down-regulates these phenomena .
Earlier studies had shown that the levels of the mRNA of genes encoding NF- « B subunits , including the p50 and c-rel , are enhanced in response to external stimuli such as antigens , cytokines , phorbol esters , and lectins ( 8 , 21-24 ) .
In addition , observations by Hohmann et al .
( 25 ) had suggested that in lymphocytes and monocytic cells , preexisting NF-kB might be exhausted and active NF- « B can be obtained by de novo protein synthesis .
The results of the Western blot analysis of this paper represent a direct demonstration of de novo synthesis of NF- « B during normal lymphocyte activation and are in agreement with these earlier obser-vations .
Our data strongly suggest that the inhibiting effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on NF- « B is due to interference with new protein synthesis .
This contention is supported by several pieces of evidence .
( i ) 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; decreased the levels of not only p50 but also its p105 precursor .
( # ) Protein levels continued to show an increasing trend with time in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D3 , albeit at a lower level .
( i ? )
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; decreased the levels of p50 in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments-hence , excluding a mere effect of the hormone on the translocation of the protein between different cell compartments .
Consistent with the evidence that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibits NF- « B protein synthesis , we found that nuclear extracts from 10994 _ Immunology : Yu et al .
human lymphocytes activated in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; exhibited significantly less binding to an NF- « B DNA binding motif compared to lymphocytes activated in the absence of the hormone .
Moreover , we have demonstrated that the inhibiting effect of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; on NF- « B protein synthesis is of functional relevance to NF- « B-driven transcription .
Indeed , activation of lymphocytes in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; caused inhibition of the transcriptional activity of a minimal promoter consisting of four tandem repeats of the NF-KB consensus sequence .
By virtue of the structure of this artificial promoter , its transcriptional activity can be regulated only by proteins that recognize this consensus sequence .
It is therefore evident that 1,25 ( OH ) > D ; must have exerted its inhibiting effect on the activity of this promoter by decreasing the levels of such proteins induced following lymphocyte activation rather than through a direct interaction of the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptor with this DNA segment .
The rank of potency of vitamin D metabolites with 1,25 ( OH ) -D ; being most effective ( Fig .
2 ) and the promoter studies of Fig .
6 support the view that the vitamin D receptor mediates the effects seen here .
Consistent with this , the effect of 1,25 ( OH ) : D ; required at least 4 hr .
Nonetheless , studies involving specific antibodies to the vitamin D receptor will be required to prove the hypothesis that this protein mediates these effects .
In preliminary studies addressing the mechanism of action of 1,25 ( OH ) : D ; on NF- « B synthesis , we have found that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; decreases the steady-state mRNA levels of the 4.4-kb transcript of p50 ( 26 ) .
However , using PBMCs from different subjects , we have found variations on the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , effect at the mRNA abundance level .
These and related observations suggest a very complicated mechanism of action that may involve actions at the transcriptional , translational , and posttranslational levels as well as at the level of the interaction between the p50 and its inhibitor , IxB , by affecting phosphorylation of the latter protein .
The last possibility has been suggested by recent studies of Karin and colleagues ( 27 ) regarding the mechanism of glucocorticosteroid effects on NF- « B .
NF- « B enhances the expression of IL-2 and the IL-2 recep-tor , two molecules critical for lymphocyte proliferation ( 28 ) .
On the other hand , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibits IL-2 production and lymphocyte proliferation ( 1 ) , raising the possibility that the antiproliferative effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; could have been mediated via the inhibition of NF- « B .
However , the time courses of the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on NF- « B expression and lymphocyte proliferation were different .
Specifically , whereas 1,25 ( OH ) > D ; could inhibit cell proliferation only when it was added within the first 24 hr following activation , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; decreased p50 and p105 levels when added to the culture as late as 64 hr following addition of the activating agent .
This suggests that the antiproliferative effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is not the result of its effects on NF- « B .
This view is supported by the observation that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; has no effect on the proliferation of lymphocytes activated by OKT3 ( 1 ) , even though ( as shown here ) it inhibits NF- « B expression in OKT3-activated lymphocytes .
The relevance of the inhibiting effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on NF- « B proteins to the immunoregulating properties of this hormone is a matter of conjecture .
Nevertheless , even though genes encoding NF-kB subunits are constitutively expressed in lymphocytes , new synthesis of these subunits would seem essential to replenish them , especially in situations where they might be rapidly consumed such as lymphocyte activation .
Hence , induced expression of NF- « B subunits may be necessary to sustain nuclear NF- « B activity over longer periods of stimulation .
In fact , based on evidence from studies on the transition from pre-B to B cells , it has been suggested that preexisting versus de novo synthesized NF- « B subunits play a Proc .

In view of these considerations , it is tempting to speculate that the expression of the 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; receptor following activation and the down-regulating effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on new synthesis of NF- « B-related proteins represent a biologic mechanism whereby excessive lymphocyte activation might be prevented .
In this report , we have obtained preliminary evidence that glucocorticosteroids , another class of steroid hormones with ubiquitous effects in biology including immunomodulating properties , exert effects similar to those of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on NF- « B expression .
In line with this finding , Hass et al .
( 29 ) have shown that glucocorticosteroids inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced transient increase in NF- « B mRNA levels in the monocytic cell line U937 ( 29 ) .
Taken together , these observations raise the possibility that steroid hormones with widespread regulatory influences on a large variety of genes might be exerting part of their actions , indirectly , through their ability to modulate the expression of ubiquitous transcription factors , such as NF- « B .
We thank Dr. Nancy Rice for the generous provision of the antibodies , Dr. Michael Su ( Vertex Pharmaceuticals , Cambridge , MA ) for providing the p ( NF- « B ) 4-CAT construct , and Ms. Niki Barker for the preparation of the manuscript .
