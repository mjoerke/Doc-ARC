Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a cDNA , CHEMR1 , Encoding a Chemokine Receptor With a Homology to the Human C-C Chemokine Receptor , CCR-4 By Byung-S. Youn , Sang-Ho Kim , Myung S. Lyu , Christine A. Kozak , Dennis D. Taub , and Byoung S. Kwon Chemokines refer to a rapidly expanding family of small cytokines whose primary function is recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites .
These are known to bind to seven-transmembrane-domain containing receptors .
A cDNA clone , CHEMR1 , resembling the typical G protein-coupled receptor , was isolated from a mouse cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) library .
Northern blot analysis in mouse cell lines suggests that its expression is found in a variety of cells , including T cells , B cells , and macrophages .
The CHEMR1 gene Scya3r2 is a single-copy gene whose open reading frame may be in a single exon and maps to the distal region of mouse Chr 9 where the mouse macrophage inflammatory HE CHEMOKINES COMPRISE a group of small cytokines that range from 8 to 12 kD in size and are involved in inflammatory processes , immunomodulation , and inhibition of proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and T cells . ``
'' These chemokines can be divided into two families , depending on whether the first two cysteines are adjacent ( C-C chemokine or 3 ) or are separated by an intervening amino acid ( C-X-C chemokine or a ) .
The former family includes monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) , MCP-2 , MCP-3 , macrophage inflammatory protein-l « ( MIP-1 @ ) , MIP-1 8 , 1309 , RANTES , eotaxin , macrophage inflammatory protein-related protein-1 ( MRP-1 ; C10 ) , and MRP-2 ; and the latter includes interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) , interferon-y-induced protein ( IP ) -10 , neutrophil-activating peptide-2 ( NAP-2 ) , GRO , stromal cell differentiation factor ( SDF ) , and ENA-78 .
*® It has been shown that the C-C chemokines exhibit a preferential chemo-attractant potential for monocytes , whereas the C-X-C chemokines are chemo-attractants for neutrophils .
It has been documented that IL-8 , RANTES , MCP-1 , MCP-2 , MCP-3 , SDF , and MIP-18 are able to chemo-attract T lymphocytes . ``

0006-4971/97/8912-0029 $ 3.00/0 4448 protein-1i « ( MIP-1a ) receptor gene Scya3r and two related C-C chemokine receptor-like genes reside .
Amino acid sequence comparison shows that CHEMR1 is 84 % identical to human CCR-4 , indicating that CHEMR1 is likely to be a mouse CCR-4 .
Binding assays using `` * `` l-labeled C-C chemokines in mammalian cells indicated that CHEMR1 did not bind MIP-1 @ , RANTES , or MIP-1 , whereas CCR-1 binds MIP-la and RANTES .
Our result is different from the reported properties of human CCR-4 .
This suggests that CHEMR1 may be a receptor for unidentified C-C chemokine or a low-affinity receptor for MIP-1 @ .

man immunodeficiency virus-type 1 ( HIV-1 ) viral replication and that HIV-1 used chemokine receptors as cofactors for the viral entry into CD4 T cells or macrophages . ``
At present , four types of C-X-C chemokine receptors have been identified `` `` `` `` : the human IL-8RA , which is selectively activated by IL-8 ; human IL-8RB , which is activated by IL-8 , GRO , and NAP-2 `` ; CX CR3 , which binds IP-10 and Mig ; and fusin ( or CX CR4 ) binding SDF .
A murine homologue of the human IL-8RB was recently isolated `` ' and the presence of another member of IL-8R , probably IL-8RA , was proposed . ``
Six members of human C-C chemokine receptor have been isolated and characterized : CCR-1 , CCR-2A , CCR-2B , CCR-3 , CCR-4 , and CCR-5 .
`` `` * `` These have overlapping ligand spec-ificities , but the precise expression of these receptors is not yet known .
In addition , isolation of several orphan receptors resembling the standard frame of C-C or C-X-C chemokine receptors makes correlation between biologic or immunologic activities of chemokines and the receptors mediating activities complicated .
Especially with regards to HIV pathogenicity , therapeutic implication of the orphan receptors becomes increasingly of interest because various HIV strains seem to use different chemokine receptors as cofactors .
`` * `` `` We previously showed that CTLL-R8 cells ( a mouse cytotoxic T-cell line ) expressed MIP-1a « receptor and that their proliferation was suppressed by MIP-1a @ . ``
We found CTLL-2 , an IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) line , also expressed the MIP-1 @ receptor ( our unpublished observation ) .
We and others have shown that recombinant MIP-la suppresses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell growth `` `` and prohibits proliferation signal through T-cell receptor ( TCR ) in primary T cells stimulated by immobilized anti-CD3 .
In an effort to understand the underlying mechanisms of the immunomodulatory function of chemokines on T cells and bone marrow stem and progenitor cells , we have attempted to clone an MIP-1a @ receptor .
As a result , we discovered a putative G-protein-coupled receptor that has striking homology to CCR-4 .
We report here the identification and characterization of another potential member of the C-C chemokine receptor family .

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) .
The RT-PCR method was used to obtain cDNAs for potential G-protein-coupled receptors from CTLL-2 .
One microgram of cytoplasmic RNA was reverse transcribed by superscript ( GIBCO ) , followed by PCR with the set of primers under the following conditions : for the first round of PCR in three cycles , denaturation was at 94°C for 1 minute , annealing at 37°C for 1.5 minutes , and extension at 72°C for 2 minutes ; and for the second round of PCR in the next 30 cycles , denaturation was at 94°C for 1 minute , annealing at 48°C for 1.5 minutes , and extension at 72°C for 2 minutes .
A pair of degenerate PCR primers was designed from the deduced amino acid sequence representing the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains of the published human IL-8 and FMLP receptors `` : for the forward primer , 5'-TT ( T/C ) ( T/OTITG ( T/O ) TGGI ( T/C/GCCITA-3 ' deduced from FLLCWLPY ; and for the reverse primer , 5'-IGG ( A/GTTIA ( A/G ) ( A/ @ CAI ( G/C ) ( AT ) ( W/G ) T ( G/T ) IA-3 ' deduced from HSCLNP .
These primers are expected to produce an approximately 150-bp fragment from the members of the chemokine receptor family .
After PCR , a 150-bp product was gel-purified , repaired by Klenow and T4 polynucleotide kinase , and ligated to the Sma I site in phosphatased pGEM3 ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
Because we expected that the 150-bp fragments contained IL-8 receptor sequence , the plasmid library containing the PCR product was screened by IL-8 receptor probe to eliminate sequences corresponding to IL-8 receptor .
Consequently , the cDNA clones that did not hybridize to IL-8 receptor probe were collected and analyzed .
The nucleotide sequence of a cDNA insert was similar to IL-8 receptor sequences but sufficiently different to be a new member of receptor .
The cDNA was named as CHEMR1 , which stands for chemokine receptor 1 .
Library screening .
- A Agtll cDNA library prepared from CTLL-All cells was screened using the CHEMR1 probe to obtain a full-length version using standard procedures . ``
'' Three overlapping cDNA clones were isolated .
cDNA insert was prepared and subcloned into pBluscript SK* ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
The entire nucleotide sequences were determined using the Erase-A base system ( Pro-mega ) .
Two of those ( 6-11 and 2-7 ) contained an overlapping 5 ' untranslated region ( UTR ) with different length and different truncation of CHEMR1 open reading frame ( ORF ) , but lacked putative translational stop codon .
The remaining cDNA clone ( 3-2 ) represented most of ORF ( from TM1 to the putative stop codon ) and 3 ' UTR .
To generate the longest CHEMR1 cDNA , the cDNA 6-11 was double-digested with Sac I and Stu I , which are located at the multicloning site of the vector and TM4 ( around +513 ) , respectively .
The resulting fragments contained 5° UTR to TM4 and were gel-purified with Gene-clean ( BIO 101 , La Jolla , CA ) and ligated into the cDNA 3-2 that had been double-digested with Sac I and Stu 4449 I. Recombinant clones were confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing of 5° UTR , the junctional region around Stu I , and 3 ' UTR .
To obtain the human homologue of CHEMR1 , a phytohemag-glutinin ( PHA ) -stimulated human peripheral blood T-cell cDNA library from Clonetech ( Palo Alto , CA ) was screened with the CHEMR1 probe at low stringency ; hybridization was conducted at 55°C in 6x SSC and the final wash was performed at 55°C in 2 % SSC .
The cDNA insert was prepared as mentioned above and its entire sequence was determined .
Northern blot .
- Poly ( A* ) RNA was prepared from mouse CTLL-R8 , CTLL-2 , D10 , A20 , 2PK3 , p388D1 , RAW 264.7 , and WEH13 cells using oligo ( dT ) cellulose column chromatography ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Three micrograms of Poly ( A* ) RNA was electrophoresed on a 1 % formaldehyde gel , transferrred to the Qiabrene ( Qia-gen , Santa Clarita , CA ) , and hybridized to CHEMR1 probe labeled by random priming .
The filter was washed at 65°C for 30 minutes in 0.5 % SSC and exposed to x-ray film ( Eastman Kodak , Rochester , NY ) .
The hybridized filters were stripped and rehybridized to the mouse # actin probe . ``
Mouse genetic mapping .
- The chromosomal location of the gene encoding CHEMR1 was determined by analysis of two multilocus crosses : ( NFS/N or C58/J X Mus musculus musculus ) X Mus musculus musculus ( Kozak et al `` `` ) and ( NFS/N X Mus spretus ) X M. spretus or C58/J ( Adamson et al `` `` ) .
DNAs from the progeny of these crosses have been typed for more than 700 markers distributed over the mouse genome , including the chromosome ( Chr ) 9 markers Gnat ] ( guanine nucleotide binding protein , a transducing subunit ) , GnaiZ ( guanine nucleotide binding protein , & inhibiting activity polypeptide 2 ) , Ck ( cholecystokinin ) , and the microsatellite markers DIMit16 and D9IMi120 .
DIMit16 and DIMi120 were typed using the primers and conditions described by Deitrich et al . ``
'' Cck was typed using as probe a 2-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment of the CCK plasmid B5 obtained from Dr J. Friedman ( The Rockefeller University , New York , NY ) .
`` ° The progeny of both crosses were typed after digestion with EcoRI polymorphisms of Cck .
The probe for Gnat ] was described previously `` and identified an HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphism in the spretus cross .
Gnai2 was identified as a BamHI polymorphism in the spretus cross using as probe the 1.5-kb insert of the clone HHCPC57* obtained from ATCC ( Rockville , MD ) .
Linkage was determined using the program LOCUS designed by C.E .
Buckler ( NIAID , Bethesda , MD ) .
The percentage of recombination and standard errors were determined according to Green ' and the gene order was determined by minimizing double recombinants .
Genomic Southern blot and genomic PCR .
Twenty micrograms of mouse genomic DNA from 129/J or human genomic DNA prepared from Mo7e cells was cleaved with appropriate restriction endo-nucleases , electrophoresed in a 1 % agarose gel , and transferred to a Quiabrene membrane .
As a probe , CHEMR1 ORF was gel-purified , labeled to greater than 10° counts per minute ( cpm ) /ug of specific activity by the random primer method , and hybridized with the membrane in a solution containing 6 % SSPE , 5 % Denhardt solution , 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , and 100 pg/mL sonicated salmon sperm DNA at 65°C overnight .
The filter was washed with 0.1 % SSC and 0.1 % SDS at 65°C for 30 minutes , dried , and exposed to x-ray film ( Eastman Kodak ) .
A number of studies have shown that C-C chemokine receptor genes are intronless .
To determine whether CHEMR1 gene constitutes intronless ORF , 1 pg of 129/J genomic DNA was amplified with the forward and reverse primers encompassing CHEMR1 ORF by using Pfu .
As controls , CCR-4 and CCR-5 ORFs were amplified from OCM !

Expression , transfection , and binding assay .
_ A Kpn UHpal fragment of CHEMR1 that included 26 bp of the 5 UTR , the entire ORF , and 27 bp of the 3 `` UTR was treated with T4 DNA polymerase and cloned into the BstXT site blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase of pRe/CMV ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) .
To express CCR-1 , the entire ORF was amplified from the Agt11 clone with pfu polymerase ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
The sequences of the forward and reverse primers were as follows : 5-GCCCAAGCTTAACCAGAGAGA-AGCCGGG-3 ' ( forward ) and 5'-GCGCTCTAGAGGCCTCCT-ATGGTCTGAG-3 ' ( reverse ) .
The underlined bases represent HindIII and Xba I sites , respectively .
The amplified fragment was gel-purified , cleaved with HindIII and Xba I , and cloned into pRe/CMV cleaved by HindIII and Xba I. Plasmids with insert were prepared according to standard procedures . ``
In parallel with the above-men-tioned expression strategy , CHEMR1 and CCR-4 ORF were directly amplified from human genomic DNA .
After sequence verification , a FLAG epitope-tagged CHEMR1 CCR-4 and CCR-1 were created with appropriate primers that had nucleotide sequences encoding FLAG epitope .
Reverse primers were the same as before .
The sequences of forward primers were as follows : 5-GCCCAAGCTT GCC GCC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG AAT GCC ATA GAG GTC ACAG-3 ' ( CHEMRI FLAG ) ; 5'-GCCCAAGCTT GCC GCC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG AAC CCC ACG GAT ATA GCAG-3 ' ( CCR-4 FLAG ) ; and 5'-GCCCAAGCTT GCC GCC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG GAA ACT CCA AAC ACC ACA GAG-3 ' ( CCR-1 FLAG ) .
The underlining indicates the nucleotide sequence encoding FLAG epitope .
Five micrograms of each chemokine was lyophilized , resuspended in 10 gL of 100 mmol/L sodium borate buffer , pH 8.5 , and added to 1 mCi of '** [ -labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent ( 2200 Ci/mmol , monoiodinated ; Dupont-NEN , Boston , MA ) .
The reaction was continued on ice for 60 minutes .
The reaction mixture was applied to a PD10 column ( Pharmacia LKB , Piscataway , NJ ) that had been pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 % gelatin .
The iodinated protein was purified from free iodine , and bovine serum albumin and sodium azide were then added to the collected fractions to final concentrations of 1 % and 0.025 % , respectively . '
'' I-human MIP-1 @ ( 2,000 Ci/mmol ) purchased from Amersham ( Arlington Heights , IL ) was used for receptor-binding assays .
Subconfluent HEK293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method . ``
After 24 hours , 2 X 10° cells were collected with the addition of 1 mmol/L EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 200 gL of the binding medium ( DMEM with 1 % bovine serum albumin ) .
Two nanomoles per liter each of iodinated MIP-la « , RANTES , and MIP-185 was used for the binding assay .
The binding assay for '*-labeled MIP-la was performed at room temperature or at 37°C for 1 hour in the presence of 100-fold excess of cold MIP-1a , whereas the binding assay for RANTES and MIP-18 was performed at room temperature for 1 hour .
The entire mixture was layered on a 10 % sucrose cushion , and the radioactivity of cell pellets was counted .
The specific binding was calculated by the difference in counts due to cold ligand competition .
For cold competition of MIP-1 @ , 0.1 nmol/L '*I-hMIP-1a @ was used in the presence of varying concentration of cold hMIP-1 « @ .

YOUN ET AL Transfected HEK 293 cells ( 2 x 10° ) were washed once with 5 mL cold 1 % Hanks ' balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) containing 5 % FBS and then resuspended in 2 mL of the same buffer .
One microgram of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ; mouse IgG ; ) was added to 100 L of cell suspension and left on ice for 30 minutes .
The treated cells were then washed with 5 mL HBSS and resuspended in 100 4L HBSS .
A total of 0.5 ug of goat antimouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) ( Zymed Laboratories , South San Francisco , CA ) was added and incubated on ice for 30 minutes .
The cells were washed the same as before and finally resuspended in 300 uL 2 % paraformaldehyde .
Receptor expression was measured by flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
RESULTS Molecular cloning of a potential chemokine receptor .
We cloned genes encoding potential G-protein-coupled receptors by RT-PCR using primers based on the known sequence of human IL-8 , N-formyl peptide , and rabbit N-formyl peptide receptors . ``
The most conserved regions were chosen from transmembrane ( TM ) regions 6 and 7 to prepare degenerate oligonucleotides .
The RT-PCR with the cytoplasmic RNA from CTLL-2 using these primer sets produced two bands with sizes of 700 and 150 bp ( data not shown ) .
Both bands were purified and cloned .
The sequence of 700 bp did not match any gene sequence from GenBank .
We analyzed approximately 200 150-bp band-derived cDNA clones .
We first eliminated clones corresponding to the murine IL-8 receptor because the majority of the clones turned out to be the mouse homologue of the human type B IL-8 receptor ( IL-8RB ) . ``
' We then grouped the rest of the clones by cross-hybridization and obtained two groups of cDNA clones .
The first groups turned out to be a mouse homologue of fusin .
* `` The second group , termed CHEMR1 , was most interesting to us because it exhibited some degree of homology to the human IL-8 receptor and MIP-l1 « / RANTES receptor ( CCR-1 ) in the amplified region and seemed to be novel .
Three overlapping cDNA clones were isolated by screening a cDNA library from CTLL-A11 with the radiolabeled CHEMR1 PCR fragment as a probe and were sequenced .
One of the longest ORFs encoding 360 amino acids was started from the methionine located at 166 bp downstream of the cDNA .
We found a putative translation stop codon located in frame in 5 ' UTR , indicating that the initiation methionine we assigned may be a presumed initia-tor .
As shown in Fig 1 , the cDNA appeared to resemble a typical G-protein-coupled receptor , based on the presence of 7 putative membrane spanning domains .
Moreover , as shown in Fig 2 , it also contained a putative G-protein binding domain , DRYLAIVHA , which is represented by asterisks , a domain that is commonly found in other chemokine receptors . ``
The putative amino-terminal ligand binding domain is composed of highly acidic amino acids .
Compared with known chemokine receptors , a Pro*-Cys `` `` motif in the amino-terminal region and a Cys® `` `` in the third predicted extracellular loop are conserved in CHEMR1 .
The third predicted intracellular loop is comprised of highly basic amino acids .
These features suggest that CHEMR1 represents a potential chemokine receptor . ``
Interestingly , the amino-terminal region lacks an N-glycosylation site .
But the second predicted extracellular domain has a potential N-glycosyla- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

During preparation of this manuscript , eosinophil- and basophil-derived C-C chemokine receptors were isolated , CCR-3 and CCR-4 , respectively . ``
'' `` `` Macrophage tropic HIV cofactor , CCR-5 , was recently isolated . ``
The rank order of amino acid identity of known human chemokine receptors to CHEMR1 was CCR-4 ( 84 % ) > CCR-1 ( 47 % ) ~CCR-5 ( 47 % ) > CCR-3 ( 41 % ) , ~CCR-2A ( 41 % ) , > IL-8RA ( 37 % ) , ~IL-8RB ( 37 % ) .
CHEMRI expression .
- Northern blot analysis was performed using poly ( A* ) RNA from various murine cell lines .
As shown in Fig 3 , CTLL-2 ( CD8* T-cell line ) , D10 ( CD4* , Th2 cell line ) , 2PK3 ( B-cell lymphoma ) , and WEHI3 ( mac-rophage ) expressed CHEMR1-related mRNA .
A CHEMR1 message was detected in CTLL-R8 cells at prolonged expo-sure .
In all cases , a single mRNA of about 4.0 kb was de-tected , suggesting that the native CHEMRI message may include longer 5 ' or 3 ' UTR than the CHEMR1 cDNA presented here .
The CHEMR1 is a single copy gene that maps to mouse Chr 9 .
Genomic southern hybridization was performed at high stringency .
CHEMR1 cDNA representing its ORF was used as a probe .
Results suggest that the CHEMR1 gene is a single copy gene .
As shown in Fig 4A , HinclI or Kpn I digestion produced bands of 531 bp and 867 bp , respectively , which are the same size as expected from CHEMR1 cDNA .
The result suggests that CHEMR1 ORF may be intronless .
HinclI digestion produced a faint band around 1.9 kb , which was also observed in C57B1/6 .
The nature of the band is currently unknown .
We performed a human genomic Southern blot using the same probe at high stringency .
This showed that human genomic DNA possessed the human homologue of CHEMR1 .
To determine whether the ORF portion of CHEMR1 gene is intronless , the CHEMR1 ORF was directly amplified from 129/J mouse genomic DNA .
As controls , CCR-4 and CCR-5 were also amplified from human genomic DNA .
CCR-5 has been shown to be an intronless gene and CCR-4 has -- - _ CTLL-A 4453 CTLL-R8 D10 A20 2PK3 RAW264.7 -- -- _ P388D1 -- -- _ WEHI3 CHEMR1 been shown to be intronless as well ( our unpublished observation ) .
Figure 4B clearly shows that CHEMR1 ORF could be directly amplified from mouse genomic DNA as were CCR-5 and CCR-4 .
This suggests that CHEMR 1 is intronless and could be classified as a member of C-C chemokine receptor supergene family .
The mouse locus encoding CHEMR1 is termed Scya3r2 , for small inducible cytokine 3 receptor 2 .
This locus was mapped using CHEMR1 cDNA probe as hybridization probe to type DNAs from two genetic crosses .
BamHI digestion generated fragments of 3.7 and 2.5 kb in NFS/N and 6.4 kb in spretus , and Pvu II digestion produced fragments of 5.8 and 2.9 kb in NFS/N and 8.4 kb in musculus , respectively .
Inheritance of the polymorphic fragments was followed in the progeny of both crosses and compared with that of more than 700 markers previously typed and mapped .
Scya3r2 was mapped to the distal end of Chr 9 based on an analysis of both crosses ( Fig 5 ) .
Closest linkage was observed with DIMi120 , with no recombinants identified in 121 mice , indicating that , at the 95 % confidence level , these genes are within 2.4 centimorgans .
As indicated in Fig 5 , the most telomeric region of Chr 9 shows conserved linkage with human chromosome 3 , suggesting that the human homolog of this gene maps to chromosome 3p22-21 .
This is interesting because the human homolog of the MIP-1 @ /RANTES receptor gene , termed CMKBR1 , has been mapped to 3p21 .
This suggests the possibility that these genes may be clustered .
CHEMR1 may not be a MIP-la , MIP-1B , or RANTES receptor .
- The CHEMR1 and CCR-1 ORFs were inserted downstream of the CMV promoter in both sense and antisense orientations .
These receptors were then expressed tran-siently in HEK 293 cells .
A single species of mRNA was detected below 188 for both receptors ( Fig 6 ) .

- Genomic analysis of CHEMRA1 gene .
Evidence for existence of the human homologue of CHEMR1 and for CHEMR1 being intronless .
{ A ) 129/J genomic DNA ( 20 pg ) and human genomic DNA prepared from Mo7e cells were digested with the restriction enzymes indicated , run on a 1 % agarose gel , transferred to Quiabrane , and hybridized with [ °°P ] CHEMR1 ORF .
The filter was washed finally with 0.5x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 65°C , and the blots were exposed to XAR-5 film in cassettes at -70°C for 6 days .
DNA molecular standards from BRL were run in parallel .
The CHEMR1 cDNA has two Kpn | ( -26 and 840 ) and Hincll ( 580 and 1,110 ) sites , which release around 867 and 531 bp , respectively .
These bands are indicated by arrows .
( B ) One microgram of 129/J genomic DNA or OCM1 genomic DNA was amplified with Pfu polymerase in the presence of 50 pmol of each of the corresponding primers as indicated in the Materials and Methods .
After 30 cycles of amplification , one-tenth volume of PCR reaction mixture was resolved on a 1 % agarose gel .
Indicated with arrows are amplified ORFs of chemokine receptors .
The same molecular standards were used as in ( A ) .

'' I-RANTES bound slightly to CCR-1 at room temperature ( Fig 7B ) .
MIP-1/5 did not bind to CCR-1 or CHEMR1 at room temperature ( Fig 7C ) or at 37°C ( data not shown ) .
One possible reason for our inability to detect appreciable binding of such chemokines to CHEMR1 is the lack of appropriate surface expression in the transfected cells .
To determine whether our transfection system allows chemokine receptors to be extracellularly expressed , FLAG epitope was introduced to CHEMR1 , CCR-1 , and CCR-4 .
CCR-4 was used for comparison with CHEMR1 because of its sequence similarity .
After transfection , extracellular presentation of the receptors was detected by flow cytometry with anti-FLAG MoAb .
As shown in Fig 8 , all three receptors were expressed on the HEK 293 cell surface .
To determine whether ' `` I-MIP-1a binds to these receptors , competition binding assays were conducted .
As shown in Fig 9 , only CCR-1 bound ' `` I-MIP-1 @ , whereas neither CHEMR1 nor CCR-4 bound ' `` I-MIP-1a .
These results again suggest that CHEMR1 may not be functionally identical to MIP-1a , RANTES , or a receptor and may be a novel chemokine receptor for a yet unidentified C-C chemokine .
DISCUSSION In the present study , we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mouse cDNA encoding a potential chemokine receptor .
CHEMR1 contained the predicted G-protein binding domain , DRYLAIVHA , * a pair of cysteines that form an interdisulfide bond between Pro*-Cys* and Cys®* `` *-Thr `` , which form a putative ligand-binding domain . ``

MURINE CCR-4 receptor kinases . ``
This region is believed to be involved in receptor desensitization . ``
Previous studies by our laboratory have shown that mouse CTL cell lines express MIP-la receptors .
Several lines of evidence strongly indicate that T cells have receptors for MIP-1a , and RANTES . ``
Because CHEMR1 originated from a CTL cDNA library , we initially tested chemokine binding of CHEMR1 using radiolabeled C-C chemokines .
Our results showed that CHEMR 1 did not bind MIP-1a @ , MIP-1/ , or RANTES ( Figs 7 , 8 , and 9 ) .
Preliminary data suggest that the stable transfectants expressing CHEMR 1 did not seem to mobilize Ca** , responding to each 100 nmol/L of recombinant MIP-1 @ , IL-8 , MCP-1 , and IP-10 , whereas the stable ones expressing CCR-1 exhibited small , transient elevation of Ca `` * upon stimulation with 100 nmol/L of MIP-la ( unpublished observation ) .
Based on a significant identity of amino acid between CHEMR1 and CCR-4 ( 84 % amino acid identity ) , we believe that CHEMR1 would be most related to CCR-4 .
However , our binding results established a conflict with the report by Power et al . ``
'' CCR-4 was able to stimulate a Ca®* -activated chloride channel in Xenopus oocytes upon stimulation with 1 umol/ L of MIP-1a @ , RANTES , and MCP-1 using the voltage clamp CHR 9 3p21,3p21.3-p21.2 +-Gnatl , GnaiZ - , 10/102 ( 9.8 £ 2.9 ) -- DIMit16 -- Scya3r2 , D9Mit20 - , 0/109 ( 0.8 £ 0.8 ) 4/117 , 4/107 ( 3.6 £ 1.2 ) 3p22-p21.3 +-Cck | | Fig 5 .

technique .
Because a very high concentration of chemokines was used and more sensitive measurements than equilibrium binding assay or conventional Ca** mobilization assays were used in the studies of Power et al , `` `` the chemokines could still trigger CCR-4 if it were a low-affinity receptor for MIP-la , RANTES , or MCP-1 .
During preparation of this report , Hoogewerf et al `` `` reported the murine CCR-4 and showed that the murine and human CCR-4 were high-affinity receptors for MIP-1 « and RANTES in transfected HL60 cells .
By contrast to their previous report , MCP-1 did not bind to these receptors . ``
The murine CCR-4 has a 97 % amino acid identity with CHEMR1 , but the nucleotide sequences of 5 ' and 3 ' UTR are somewhat different between the two receptor genes .
Therefore , CHEMR1 could be a receptor different from the murine CCR-4 .
This could explain the difference in binding activities between CHEMR1 and the murine CCR-4 .
If CHEMR1 and the murine CCR-4 are the same gene product and the differences in amino acid sequence and UTR sequence are simply due to an allelic variation , the conflict From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Twenty micro- _ __ R grams of FLAG epitope-tagged O CHEMR1 , CCR-4 , and CCR-1 and - O a 0.5 pug of CMV-luciferase gene were transfected into HEK 293 = cells .
After 12 hours , 2 x 10° cells were washed , resuspended in HBSS , and mixed with 1 pg of either anti-FLAG MoAb ( M2 ) or mouse IgG , isotype control .
After washing the cells , the cells were incubated with goat antimouse IgG-FITC , washed , and subjected to flow cytometric analysis .
The shaded areas indicate the isotype control , whereas the lines denote fluorescence reflecting expression of the chemokine receptors .
Each 2 x 10° transfected cells produced approximately 10,000 light units of - luciferase - activity ; therefore , the fluorescence intensity shown above represents a quantitative difference of the surface expression of each receptor due to compensating the difference of transfection efficiency .
At this condition , the mean fluorescence - intensities ( MFI ) for CHEMR1 , CCR-4 , and CCR-1 were 127.7 , 24.9 , and 91.2 , respectively .
Cell Number simply may reflect the difference in experimental approach .
For example , Hoogewerf et al `` `` used HL6O cells to express recombinant CCR-4 .
Because it is known that HL6O0 cells express endogenous CCR-5 , `` ' the high-affinity binding of MIP-1a and RANTES seen by Hoogewerf et al `` `` might be due to endogenous CCR-5 .
Because our data clearly showed that CHEMR1 and the human CCR-4 were extracellularly expressed , the negative binding of MIP-1 « to these receptors may not be at least due to an experimental flaw .
Therefore , our data do not support the binding results of Hoogewerf et al . ``
'' Alternatively , it is possible that MIP-1 « did not bind to CHEMR1 or CCR-4 because MIP-1 @ is a low-affinity ligand to the receptors .
Although CHEMR1 may not bind MIP-1 « , RANTES , or it may still be an important chemokine receptor , because it is expressed in different hematopoietic cell lines .
The CHEMR1 mRNA was detected in CTL lines ( CTLL-2 and CTLL-R8 ) , a B-cell lymphoma cell line ( Z2PK3 ) , a macrophage cell line ( WHE13 ) , and a T-helper cell clone ( D10 ) .
Hoogewerf et al `` `` also described that they detected a significant expression of the mCCR-4 in a CTL line .
It is worthwhile to note that CHEMR1 cDNA was derived from a CTL cDNA library .

Because CHEMR1 was detected in different hematopoietic cell lines , we believe that CHEMR1 would be expressed in lymphoid organs .
Kozak et al `` reported the chromosomal location of one mouse MIP-1 « @ receptor and two C-C chemokine receptor-like genes .
The gene symbols for the mouse genes are Scy3ar , Scy3ar-rs1 , and Scy3ar-rs2 .
The genes for these three receptors , Scy3ar , ScyJar-rs 1 , and Scy3ar-rs2 , all map to a cluster on distal Chr 9 , but not at the same position as the CHEMR1 gene , which is about 5 centimorgans proximal to this cluster .
This region of Chr 9 is homologous to human 3p21-22 , which contains the human CCR-1 gene .
The chromosomal locations of the two IL-8 receptors ( IL-SRA and IL-8RB ) as well as that of an IL-8 receptor pseudogene were found to reside in human chromosome 2435 . ``
This region shares linkage homology with a region in mouse Chr 1 that encodes the Ity-Lsh-Beg and Vil loci . ``

The incubation mixtures were layered on 10 % sucrose gradi-ents , and labeled cells were recovered from pellets .

These observations suggest the intriguing possibility that the genes for mouse and human C-C chemokine receptors are clustered in mouse Chr 9 and human chromosome 3 in homologous regions , respectively , whereas the genes for mouse and human C-X-C chemokine receptors are clustered in regions of conserved synteny of mouse Chr 1 and human chromosome 2 , respectively .
This is reminiscent of the finding that a cluster of mouse C-C chemokine loci Scya ( small inducible cytokine ) has been mapped to Chr 11 , and the human corresponding region has been mapped to chromosome 17q-11-21.3 , where seven known C-C chemokine genes reside . ``
Even though the chromosomal location of mouse C-X-C chemokines is not currently known , human C-X-C chemokine is known to be on human chromosome 4 . ``

Because the numbers of chemokines are still increasing , further characterization of CHEMR1 or related members of this family of chemokine receptors may provide useful information on the specific function of this rapidly expanding family of molecules .
The identification of specific C-C chemokines that bind to CHEMR1 is currently under investiga-tion .
