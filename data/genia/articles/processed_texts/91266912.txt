535 CNRS and 'Laboratoire d'Immunologie Virale , Institut Pasteur , 25 Rue du Dr Roux , 75724 Paris Cédex 15 , France Communicated by P.Kourilsky The KBF1 factor , which binds to the enhancer A located in the promoter of the mouse MHC class I gene H-2K `` , is indistinguishable from the p50 DNA binding subunit of the transcription factor NF-xB , which regulates a series of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses .
The KBF1/p50 factor binds as a homodimer but can also form heterodimers with the products of other members of the same family , like the c-re/ and v-re/ ( proto ) oncogenes .
The dimerization domain of KBF1/pS50 is contained between amino acids 201 and 367 .
A mutant of KBF1/p50 ( ASP ) , unable to bind to DNA but able to form homo- or heterodimers , has been constructed .
This protein reduces or abolishes in vitro the DNA binding activity of wild-type proteins of the same family ( KBF1/p50 , c- and v-rel ) .
This mutant also functions in vivo as a trans-acting dominant negative regulator : the transcriptional inducibility of the HIV long terminal repeat ( which contains two potential NF-xB binding sites ) by phorbol ester ( PMA ) is inhibited when it is co-transfected into CD4* T cells with the ASP mutant .
Similarly the basal as well as TNF or IL1-induced activity of the MHC class I H-2K `` promoter can be inhibited by this mutant in two different cell lines .
These results constitute the first formal demonstration that these genes are regulated by members of the rel/NF-xB family .
Key words : heterodimer/KBF1/rel/NF-xB/transdominant negative mutant Introduction Nuclear factors that bind to the promoter of the H-2K `` ° mouse major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) have been identified ( Kimura et al .
, 1986 ; Baldwin and Sharp , 1987 ; Isracl et al .
, 1987 ; Burke et al .
, 1989 ) .
A factor called KBFI which binds to the enhancer A sequence ( Kimura et a/ .
, 1986 ) has been suggested to be responsible for basal expression of MHC class I genes ( Israél et al .
, 1989a , b ) .
This protein was purified ( Yano et al .
, 1987 ) and the cDNA coding for KBFI has been cloned ( Kieran et a/ .
, 1990 ) .
Recently , we have demonstrated that the DNA binding subunit ( p50 ) of NF-xB ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ) and KBF1 are indistinguishable and that they belong to a family of structurally related factors that also contains the c- and v-rel ( proto ) oncogenes and the Drosophila dorsal gene products ( Kieran et al .
, 1990 ; see also Ghosh et al .
, 1990 ; © Oxford University Press Gilmore , 1990 ) .
The factor NF-xB which binds to the xB site located in the enhancer of the immunoglobulin x light chain gene ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986 ) and to the enhancer A sequence of H-2K `` ( Baldwin and Sharp , 1988 ) is composed of two different subunits ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ) : a 50 kd DNA binding subunit ( KBF1/p50 ) and a non-DNA binding 65 kd subunit ( p65 ) .
The cytoplasmic inactive form of NF-xB is composed of p50 , p65 and IxB ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1988 ) .
IxB inhibits the DNA binding activity of NF-xB and prevents its translocation into the nucleus .
In addition , the DNA binding activity of KBF1/p50 is also controlled by a proteolytic event which releases p50 from a 105 kd precursor ( Kieran et al .
, 1990 ; Ghosh et al .
, 1990 ) .
Many transcription factors bind DNA as dimers and they can form heterodimers with other members of the same family ( Jun/Fos : Turner and Tjian , 1989 ; MyoD/Id : Benezra et al .
, 1990 ; retinoic acid/thyroid hormone receptor : Glass et al .
, 1989 ) .
The combination of different monomers may have different transcriptional effects ( Jones , 1990 ) .
Our previous results ( Kieran et al .
, 1990 ) demonstrate that KBF1/p50 binds to its site as a dimer and that KBF1/p50 and v-rel can form heterodimers in vitro .
Structure-function studies of different eukaryotic transcription factors have allowed the defining of a certain number of specific motifs responsible for DNA binding and dimerization ( Mitchell and Tjian , 1989 ; Murre et al .
, 1989 ) .
KBF1/p50 contains no obvious homology with DNA binding and dimerization domains characterized so far , but preliminary experiments have demonstrated that the DNA binding and dimerization domain are contained within amino acids 19-367 ( Ghosh et al .
, 1990 ; Kieran et al .
, 1990 ) .
We have assayed various deletion mutants for either DNA binding or dimerization ability and report here the functional characterization of a mutant which allows dimerization but not DNA binding .
Results A series of internal or C-terminal deletion mutants have been assayed for DNA binding activity by bandshift ( Ghosh et al .
, 1990 ; Kieran et al .
, 1990 ) .
Lack of DNA binding activity could be due to disruption or deletion of either the dimerization or DNA binding domains ( or both ) .
We therefore decided to localize the dimerization region of KBF1/p50 .
We made the assumption that the same region is necessary for the formation of p50-p50 homodimers and pSO-rel heterodimers , as suggested by the strong sequence conservation between p50 and rel products , and assayed various deletion mutants of p50 for their ability to associate with full-length v- or c-rel .
Association was first evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation of v- or c-rel , using an anti-KBF1/p50 antiserum ( Kieran et al .
, 1990 ) or anti-v-rel ( Rice et al .
, 1986 ) or anti-c-rel ( Brownell et al .
, 1989 ) antisera .
The critical DNA constructs are shown in Figure 1 .
After in vitro transcription and translation , dimerization was tested as described in Materials and methods , and the results are 1827 F.Logeat et al .
shown in Figure 2 .
As a positive control we used the Xba construct which codes for a protein ( amino acids 1-502 ) slightly larger than p50 .
This protein can be immunoprecipitated by anti-p50 ( Kieran et al .
, 1990 ) .
As shown in panel A , lane 6 compared with lanes 4 and 5 , this construct can associate with c-rel .
The Taq construct ( amino acids 287-502 ) does not co-immunoprecipitate with c-rel using anti-c-rel antiserum ( lane 1 ) , and conversely c-rel was not co-precipitated with Taq using anti-p50 antiserum ( lane 2 ) .
Results shown in panel B similarly demonstrate that the Spe construct ( amino acids 1-341 , lanes 1 and 2 ) can not associate with c-rel .
Similarly the NH construct ( amino acids 253-361 ) can not associate with v-rel ( panel C ) .
To confirm the results obtained by co-immunoprecipitation we assayed homodimer formation by glutaraldehyde crosslinking of in vitro translated products followed by immunoprecipita-tion .
The results shown in Figure 3 indicate that , as expected , the Xba construct is able to dimerize ( lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Conversely , the NH construct which is unable to form heterodimers with v- or c-rel ( not shown ) is also unable to homodimerize ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Identical results have been obtained with the Taq ( lanes 3 and 4 ) and Spe ( lanes 9 and 10 ) constructs .
These results support our initial hypothesis that the same domain is used for p50-p50 homodimer formation and p50-rel heterodimerization .

We then assayed by co-immunoprecipitation the ASP construct which corresponds to a deletion of amino acids 11-200 in the Xba construct ; this deletion mutant can associate with v-rel ( Figure 4 , lane 3 ) although it is not able to bind DNA ( Kieran et al .
, 1990 ) .
Lanes 1 and 2 show that ASP is correctly recognized by the anti-p50 antiserum , and lane 5 shows that v-rel is not recognized by this antiserum .
Oligomeric proteins which contain independent functional domains can be inhibited in vitro and in vivo by a non-DNA binding mutant which has retained its dimerization domain ( Herskowitz , 1987 ) .
We asked first if the ASP mutant could act as a transdominant inhibitor of the wild-type in vitro .
Various concentrations of ASP RNA were co-translated with a constant amount of the Xba construct RNA ( wild-type form : Figure 5A , lanes 1-4 ) or of the v-rel construct ( lanes 5-8 ) or of the c-rel construct ( not shown ) .
As shown in panel B , ASP is able to inhibit binding of the Xba product to the H-2K° `` site when assayed in a gel-shift assay ( lanes 1-4 ) .
Similar results can be obtained with v-rel ( lanes 5-7 ) and with c-rel ( lanes 9 and 10 ) .
We then assayed the in vivo effect of the ASP mutant by asking whether its product could inhibit in vivo the binding of KBF1/p50 or NF-xB to their consensus sequence , as measured by a detectable inhibition of transcriptional activity .
We decided to test first whether the introduction of an expression vector coding for ASP in T cells could prevent the activation of the NF-xB dependent enhancer of HIV-1 .
With this aim , we transfected J.Jhan T cells , either with the plasmid LTR-luc ( where the reporter gene luciferase is under the control of the HIV-1 LTR ) or with 3-Enh-TK-luc ( where three copies of HIV-1 enhancer are cloned upstream of the herpes virus-1 thymidine kinase promoter in the TK-luc vector ; see Materials and methods ) ( Schwartz et al .
, 1990 ) .
As expected ( Nabel and Baltimore , 1987 ) , addition of phorbol ester ( PMA ) in the culture medium resulted in a reproducible enhancement of luciferase activity with either plasmid .
The amplifications obtained were respectively 7- and 12-fold when LTR-luc and 3-Enh-TK-luc were used ( not shown ) .
This stimulation effect was decreased when the Fig .

1828 CMV-ASP construct ( where the ASP cDNA has been cloned downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer ) was co-transfected ( Figure 6 , lower panels ) .
The level of inhibition of the induced activity of both constructs was dependent on the concentration of CMV-ASP DNA used in the co-transfection assays .
With both luciferase expression vectors , the inhibition reached ~80 % with the highest concentration of CMV-ASP DNA used ( corresponding to a ratio of 6.7 between CMV-ASP and the luciferase reporter plasmid ) .
As a control we replaced CMV-ASP by the vector Rc-CMV , which contains no cDNA sequence .
We did not observe significant variations in luciferase activity , regardless of the plasmid concentration ( upper panels ) .
We performed similar competition experiments using the enhancer or promoter of the mouse MHC class I H-2K `` ® gene in HeLa and Cos-7 cells .
The results are shown in Table I .
It can be seen that both a promoter ( containing potential NF-xB binding sites ; Israél et al .
, 1989b ) and an enhancer construct derived from the H-2K `` promoter were efficiently inhibited by a five times molar excess of the CMV-ASP construct .
The inhibition observed with the promoter construct was not as strong as with the enhancer construct , probably due to the fact that there are other elements involved 1 2 3 4 5 6 17 8 + + + _+ D= -_92 -69 M- qweup 46 case a ~ -30 < % _21 n -14 Fig .

Interestingly both basal and induced levels of the K® promoter were inhibited by the ASP construct .
Induction of K° expression by TNF ( Tumor Necrosis Factor ) in HeLa cells has been shown to be due to binding of NF-xB to the enhancer sequence while KBF1/p50 ( and possibly AP2 ) are probably responsible for basal level of expression ( Israél et al .
, 1989b ) .
For the Cos-7 cells induction experiments we have used interleukin 1 ( IL1 ) instead of TNF because the stimulation observed was much stronger ; bandshift assays have demonstrated that IL-1 treatment resulted in NF-xB induction ( not shown ) .

Inhibition of HIV-1 enhancer or promoter activation by the CMV-ASP construct .
J.Jhan cells ( 4 x 10° ) were co-transfected either with Rc-CMV ( upper panels ) or with CMV-ASP ( lower panels ) in various amounts , together with a fixed amount of LTR-luc ( left panels ) of 3-Enh-TK-luc ( right panels ; E refers to the 3-Enh-TK-luc plasmid ) .
Transfected cells were exposed to PMA from 24 to 40 h after transfection , after which the cells were processed for luciferase assay .
The ratio between the competitor ( Re refers to the Rc-CMV vector , ASP to the CMV-ASP expression vector coding for the ASP mutant ) and the test plasmid is indicated under the histogram bars .
Each bar represents the mean of luciferase activities obtained in four independent experiments .
The standard deviation never exceeded 10 % .
efficient when cells are induced , suggesting that under these conditions the enhancer region plays a more prominent role in the overall promoter activity .
These results demonstrate that the ASP mutant can inhibit both KBF1/p50 and NF-xB activities in vivo ( see Israel et al .
, 1989b , and Discussion ) .
Discussion Experiments presented here show that the dimerization domain of KBF1/p50 can be functionally separated from the DNA binding domain .
The dimerization domain is localized between amino acids 201 and 367 .
Further studies using Bal 3\ digestion and site-directed mutagenesis should allow its more precise localization .
Recently , Ip et al .
( 1991 ) have demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of the Drosophila protein dorsal , which also belongs to the rel/NF-xB family ( Ghosh et al .
, 1990 ; Kieran et al .
, 1990 ) , is mediated by the NF-xB-rel homology region .
An internal deletion between amino acids 245 and 325 does not abolish DNA binding activity .
Although dorsal recognizes sites that are slightly different from those recognized by NF-xB , if we assume that the two proteins use the same type of dimerization domain , these results suggest that this domain might be split into two parts and that the region between amino acids 245 and 325 in dorsal ( which corresponds to amino acids 270-350 of the KBF1/p50 protein ) could be dispensable for dimerization .
However , it must be kept in mind that we have not been able to demonstrate association between dorsal and KBF1/p50 by co-immunoprecipitation of co-translated proteins using an anti-p50 antiserum ( Kieran et al .
, 1990 ) .
Further studies will be required to answer those questions .
We found no obvious homology with previously characterized motifs in this region , suggesting that KBF1/p50 , v-rel and c-rel , which all can form heterodimers , 1830 Table I.

use a novel type of dimerization domain .
The internally deleted construct ASP , which can not bind DNA but can form homo- or heterodimers ( with KBF1/p50 or c- or v-rel ) can inhibit the DNA binding activity of the wild-type construct in vitro by forming inactive heterodimers .
The same construct acts in vivo by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of promoter or promoter elements which have been demonstrated to bind KBF1/p50 or NF-xB , most likely by the same mechanism .
These results show that the DNA binding domain of each monomer is required for binding to DNA .
However , this does not necessarily imply that the NF-xB complex uses the same surfaces to contact DNA .
The recent observation that the p65 protein is also related to the rel family ( Ghosh et al .
, 1990 ) as well as the clear-cut differences observed between KBF1/p50 and NF-xB in their respective DNA binding properties ( Kieran et al .
, 1990 ) might suggest a situation similar to the jun-fos system ( Turner and Tjian , 1989 ) where p50 and p65 would bind DNA together , although p65 does not seem to be able to bind by itself ( Baeuerle and Baltimore , 1989 ) .
The fact that the ASP construct can inhibit both basal and induced expression of MHC class I genes in two cell lines as well as induced HIV expression in a CD4* T cell line constitutes the first formal proof that these cellular or viral sequences are regulated by a member ( or several ) of the NF-xB-rel family .
It has recently been suggested that the product of the protooncogene c-re/ might be involved in the overall 'NF-xB ' activity observed in activated T cells ( Ballard et al .
, 1990 ; Molitor et al .
, 1990 ) .
Experiments shown in Figure 5 suggest that ASP could inhibit c-re/ activity in vivo as well .
Conversely it suggests that the previously cloned factors MBP-1 ( Baldwin et al .
, 1990 ) or PRDIIBF !
( Fan and Maniatis , 1990 ) are probably not involved in the expression of these genes at least in the cell lines studied ( which include for HIV-1 a CD4 * T cell line which is its physiological host ) , because their sequences contain no motif homologous to rel or KBF1/p50 and most likely could not form heterodimers with ASP .
The recent observation that the C-terminal region of the c-re/ protooncogene contains a transcriptional activation domain ( Bull et al .
, 1990 ) and that it can be translocated into the nucleus of activated T cells ( Ballard et al .
, 1990 ) suggests that its role in the regulation of a series of genes described as responsive to NF-xB alone has probably been overlooked .
Constitutive over-expression of the ASP protein ( or similar deletion mutants ) is expected to down-regulate all genes expressed under the control of a member of the rel/NF xq ) ; family , which include among others MHC class I , immunoglobulin x-chain , the IL-2 receptor and the B-interferon genes .
It could thus interfere with B and T cell activation .
In this respect it will be interesting to analyze the phenotype of transgenic mice over-expressing ASP .
Another intriguing issue is whether there exist 'natural ' negative transdominant mutants of NF-xB , similar to the Id member of the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors ( Benezra et al .
, 1990 ) , that could act to finely tune the expression and activity of this critical factor .
The characterization of other members of the rel/NF-xB family should help to answer this question .
Materials and methods Plasmids The v-re !
l cDNA in Bluescript was kindly provided by M.Hannink and H.Temin ( Hannink and Temin , 1989 ) .
It was cut at the HinclI site for in vitro transcription and translation , giving rise to a full-length protein .
The c-re/ cDNA was kindly provided by N.Rice ( Brownell et al .

The Taq construct ( see Figure 1 ) was derived from the Xba construct by restriction with Tagl , filling-up with the Klenow enzyme and digestion with Xbal .

This construct was linearized with Xbal for in vitro transcription .
The NH construct was derived from the cDNA coding for the mouse precursor of p50 ( Ghosh et al .
, 1990 ; kindly provided by S.Ghosh and D.Baltimore ) by digestion with NsiI and HindIII ( this fragment codes for amino acids 244-361 , but uses as a start codon an ATG located at position 253 ; data not shown ) .
A transdominant negative mutant of rel/NF-xB This fragment was then cloned between the PstI and HindIII sites of pBluescript KS+ , and linearized with Hind for in vitro transcription .
The expression vectors used for transient transfections into mammalian cells were constructed as follows : the ASp cDNA was excised from the Bluescript construct by digestion with HindIII and Xbal and subcloned in the same sites of the Re-CMV expression vector ( Invitrogen ) , to give CMV-ASP .
The Ltr-lue plasmid carries the reporter luciferase gene under the control of the U3R ( Bg/Il -HindIH fragment ) of HIV-1 ( LAVI Bru strain ) LTR .

Lower case letters correspond to HindIII compatible linker ends that do not belong to the LTR sequence ; the two putative NF-xB binding sites are in bold .
The ( ab } 4-CAT construct has been described in Isracl et al .

, 1986 ) .
The ( 393 ) H2-CAT construct contains 393 bp of the MHC class I H-2K `` promoter [ including the enhancer element of the ( ab ) 4-CAT construct ] cloned upstream of the CAT gene and has been described in Kimura et al .
( 1986 ) .
Cell cultures and reagents The CD4* human lymphoblastoid T cell line J.Jhan derived from the Jurkat cell line ( a kind gift from J.D.Fox , London ) was grown in RPMI 1640 ( GIBCO ) medium supplemented with 10 % FCS ( Boehringer ) and antibiotics .
PMA was from Sigma ( St Louis ) .
Human HeLa and monkey Cos-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % new-born calf serum .

Briefly , cells ( 4 % 10° ) were transfected with a fixed amount ( 30 ng ) of either LTR-luc or 3-Enh-TK-lue .
CMV-ASP was co-transfected with either plasmid at various concentrations ( 30-200 ng ) .
As a control , Re-CMV was used at the same concentrations as CMV-ASP .
Transfected cells were exposed to PMA ( 20 ng/ml ) for 16 h , from 24 to 40 h after transfection .
Luciferase activity was measured according to Schwartz et al .
( 1990 ) .
HeLa and Cos-7 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique as described in Kimura er al .
( 1986 ) .
The RSV-Sgal construct was co-transfected along with the various CAT constructs , and the 3-galactosidase activity was used to correct for variations due to variable transfection efficiencies ( Kimura et al .
, 1986 ) .
In vitro transcription and translation 4 ug of various derivatives of the p50 cDNA cloned in pBluescript were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes and in vitro transcribed using T7 or T3 polymerase according to the manufacturer 's recommendation ( Stratagene ) .
RNA was extracted , ethanol precipitated and redissolved in 20 ul of water .
RNA ( 2 al ) was translated in wheat germ extracts ( Promega ) adjusted to 60 mM potassium acetate .
Immunoprecipitations These were carried out as described in Murre er al .
( 1989 ) in a 100 al volume containing 2 al of in vitro translated products , 1 gl of anti-p50 antiserum No .
2 ( Kieran er al .
, 1990 ) , anti-v-rel ( Rice et al .
, 1986 ) or anti-c-rel ( Brownell et al .
, 1989 ) and 20 al of protein A-Sepharose CLAB ( Pharmacia ) .
The immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide ( Laemmli , 1970 ) using 10 or 12 % Tricine-SDS gels ( Schigger and von Jagow , 1987 ) .
Gel-shift assays These were performed as described in Israél ef al .
( 1987 ) .
Glutaraldehyde crosslinking Equal amounts of in vitro translated products were diluted 15 times and treated or not with 0.002 % glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature .
Samples were then immunoprecipitated with anti-p50 antiserum in a volume of 500 ul and analyzed on 12 % polyacrylamide-SDS-Tricine gels .
