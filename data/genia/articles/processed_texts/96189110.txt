5 Role of EGR1 in Regulation of Stimulus-Dependent CD44 Transcription in B Lymphocytes JONATHAN S $ .
MALTZMAN , JULIE A. CARMAN , anp JOHN G. MONROE* Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104 Received 14 September 1995/Returned for modification 27 October 1995/Accepted 22 February 1996 The immediate-early gene egr-1 encodes a transcription factor ( EGR1 ) that links B-cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) signals to downstream activation events through the regulation of previously unidentified target genes .
Here we identify the gene encoding the lymphocyte homing and migration protein CD44 as a target of EGR1 regulation in B cells .
BCR-induced increases in CD44 mRNA expression and transcription levels are shown to occur in EGR1-expressing but not in nonexpressing subclones of the B-cell line WEHI-231 .
Kinetics of egr-1 transcription and the appearance of nuclear EGR1 protein precede CD44 induction and occur within 30 min after stimulation in the EGR1-expressing subclone .
A single EGR1 binding motif is demonstrated at bp -301 of the human CD44 promoter .
Cotransfection of a CD44 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct with an egr-1 expression vector resulted in a 6.5- to 8.5-fold induction of transcriptional activity relative to an empty expression vector .
The EGR1 binding motif was shown to be necessary for stimulus-induced expression of a CD44 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct in nontransformed B lymphocytes and was required for transactivation by an EGR1 expression vector in a B-cell line .
These studies identify EGR1 as an intermediary linking BCR-derived signals to the induction of CD44 .
The relevance of these molecular events to BCR signal transduction and antigen-stimulated B-cell-mediated immune responses is discussed .
In vivo , antigenic stimulation of mature B lymphocytes initiates processes leading to alterations in cell surface pheno-type , migration and adhesion , clonal proliferation and , ulti-mately , differentiation into memory and antibody-secreting plasma cells .
An approach to understanding the underlying molecular basis for these changes has been to study signal transduction events associated with cross-linking of the B-cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) of mature B lymphocytes .
It is well established that BCR cross-linking leads to alterations in biochemical second messengers ( 4 ) followed by the induction of immediate-early-gene-encoded transcription factors ( 28 , 39 , 42 ) ; the latter are thought to function by translating second-messenger pathways into relevant B-cell responses through the coordinate regulation of secondary ( delayed ) response genes ( 35 ) .
CD44 ( Pgp-1 ) is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on multiple cell types , including both B and T lymphocytes ( 2 ) .
Cell surface levels are upregulated on murine B lymphocytes following stimulation through the BCR ( 5 ) .
CD44 has recently been shown to be the cellular receptor for hyaluronic acid ( HA ) ( 2 , 40 , 63 ) .
Binding to HA has been implicated in the migration of lymphocytes to and their retention in peripheral lymphoid tissues ( 45 ) .
BCR-induced changes in CD44 expression ( 44 ) and posttranslational modification ( 22 , 27 , 32 ) are proposed to facilitate B-cell migration to and retention in secondary lymphoid organs where they then encounter and receive secondary activation signals from T helper cells .
The immediate-early gene egr-1 ( 60 , 61 ) ( also known as NGFI-A [ 38 ] , Krox-24 [ 30 ] , and Zif268 [ 13 ] ) encodes a nuclear * Corresponding author .

2283 protein ( EGR1 ) that is the prototypic member of a family of transcription factors sharing a conserved zinc finger DNA binding motif ( 6 , 41 ) .
Although these proteins bind with high affinity to the consensus 9-bp site 5'-GCG ( T/G ) GG GCG-3 ' ( 12 , 31 ) , binding to motifs differing in 1 or 2 bp has also been reported ( 41 , 49 ) .
In addition , flanking sequences can have an effect on binding affinity ( 62 ) .
We have previously shown that egr-1 expression is induced within 30 min following BCR cross-linking of splenic B lymphocytes ( 55 ) .
Studies using antisense oligonucleotides have suggested that egr-1 expression is necessary for the in vitro activation of murine splenic B lymphocytes in response to BCR cross-linking ( 43 ) .
The EGR1 protein has been shown to be a transcriptional activator in B cells ( 8 ) as well as other cells ( 17 , 51 ) , and its role in BCR-initiated responses is thought to be due to its ability to regulate the expression of specific activation-associated genes in B cells .
Sequence analysis of the CD44 5 `` flanking region identified the presence of two potential EGR1 binding sites upstream of the proposed transcription start site of this gene .
Our unpublished data ( now shown herein ) revealed an increase in CD44 message levels between 2 and 4 h after BCR stimulation .
Thus , the kinetics of induction of the CD44 gene are consistent with its being among the class of delayed response genes in BCR-initiated B-cell responses .
The kinetics of induction of CD44 by BCR cross-linking and the presence of potential EGR1 binding sites suggested the possibility that CD44 transcription is regulated by EGR1 during BCR signaling .
In this study , we have investigated the role of EGR1 in regulating CD44 induction in response to BCR signaling and a pharmacologic agent ( the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate [ PMA ] ) which mimics specific aspects of BCR signal transduction .
Our studies indicate that CD44 is a target gene of EGR1 and , therefore , suggest that EGR1 acts to link BCR-mediated signals to the transcriptional regulation of a mediator of B-cell migration and homing .

The WEHI-231 B-cell lymphoma ( American Type Culture Collection ) and the limiting dilution subclones WEHI-231.7 and WEHI-231.1F1 ( hereafter referred to as 231.7 and 1F1 , respectively ) were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium , high glucose , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( defined ; Hyclone ) , SerExtend ( Hana Biologicals , Berkeley , Calif. ) , 3 mM 1-glutamine , and 5 x 10~* M 2-mer-captocthanol .
Cells were maintained at a minimum and maximum density of 1 10 % and 5 X 10° per ml , respectively .
B lymphocytes were isolated from spleens of BALB/c mice as previously described ( 37 ) , Briefly , spleens were ground between the frosted ends of two glass slides to produce single-cell suspensions .

RESULTS Subclones of the WEHI-231 B-cell lymphoma line differ in their expression of EGR1 .
We have developed a system which can be used to examine the involvement of EGR1 in the transcriptional regulation of other genes .
The system relies on two subclones of the WEHI-231 B-cell lymphoma which differ in expression of EGR1 .
Previous studies in our laboratory identified a subclone of WEHI-231 that was unable to express the egr-1 gene in response to BCR cross-linking or exposure to the phorbol ester PMA ( 56 ) .
Silencing of egr-1 gene transcription in this line , 231.7 , is due to methylation of the egr-1 locus ( 56 ) .
More recently , we have derived another subclone , 1F1 , in which induction of egr-1 is observed following BCR cross-linking with anti-p antibodies .
The usefulness of this system for analysis of EGR1 target genes depends upon how similar these subclones are with respect to parameters other than egr-1 inducibility .
In this regard , 231.7 and 1F1 are very similar with respect to their expression of surface IgM , IgD , CD45 , and CDS ( Fig .
1 ) .
Although there are slight variations in the expression of these surface proteins , it is unlikely that they are sufficient to affect differences in the response of these cells to antigen receptor ( IgM in these stud-ies ) stimulation .
In fact , anti-p antibody-induced tyrosine kinase activities and the growth responses of these two subclones of WEHI-231 to BCR cross-linking are nearly identical ( Fig .
1B and C , respectively ) .
WEHI-231 undergoes cell cycle arrest ( 53 ) and apoptosis ( 3 , 21 ) in response to anti-p antibody stimulation .
Both the 1F1 and 231.7 subclones showed equivalent inhibition of proliferation by anti-p antibody stimulation .
While 1F1 and 231.7 cells differ in their inducible expression of egr-1 in response to anti-p antibody stimulation ( Fig .
2A ) , they do not differ in their inducible expression of other immediate-early genes .
As shown in Fig .
2B and C , both 1F1 and 231.7 cells show induction of egr-2 , jun B , and c-myc in response to anti-p antibody stimulation .
In addition , c-fos induction was observed in both cells following anti-u antibody stimulation ( data not shown ) .
Of particular interest is the egr-2 response , 2286 MALTZMAN ET AL .

2. mRNA levels of egr-1 , egr-2 , junB , and c-myc in 1F1 and 231.7 cells after anti-p. antibody stimulation .
Cells were cultured for the indicated period of time with 50 pg of anti-p antibodies per ml , and total RNA was isolated .
Northern blots were hybridized with labeled probes from murine cDNAs of egr-1 ( A ) , egr-2 ( 1 h ) ( B ) , JunB ( C ) , c-myc ( C ) or GAPDH as a control for RNA loading .
, unstimulated controls .
which indicates that the differential inducibility of egr-1 in 1F1 and 231.7 cells does not extend universally to other members of this family .
Thus , while we can not formally rule out that the 1F1 and 231.7 subclones of WEHI-231 differ in aspects other than egr-1 inducibility , they nonetheless appear to be very sim-ilar .
For this reason , we considered that this would be a useful system to identify and evaluate EGR1 target genes in stimulated B lymphocytes .
Differential inducibility of egr-1 in 1F1 and 231.7 B cells was extended to include stimulation with the phorbol ester analog PMA .
As with anti-p antibody stimulation , Northern analysis of egr-1 revealed a lack of inducible message in the 231.7 subclone , whereas PMA stimulation ( Fig .
3A ) of 1F1 cells led to a rapid ( within 30 min ) and transient induction of egr-1 mRNA .
By bypassing the antigen receptor and directly initiating BCR-associated signaling pathways leading to egr-1 gene induction ( 36 ) , PMA is believed to model Ig M-induced egr-1 .
In so doing , we have observed PMA to be a more efficient inducer of egr-1 expression than anti-p antibody .
Finally , the kinetics of PMA-induced egr-1 expression in these cells closely parallel the induction of egr-1 in primary B lymphocytes by PMA or anti-p antibody ( 55 ) .
As would be expected from Northern analysis ( Fig .
3A ) , stimulated 1F1 cells expressed the EGR1 protein , whereas 231.7 cells do not .
Nuclear extracts of PMA-stimulated 1F1 cells but not 231.7 cells exhibited EGR1 binding to a probe containing a consensus EGR1 binding site that was specifically inhibited by an oligonucleotide containing two consensus binding sites ( EGR1 in Fig .
3B ) .
An oligonucleotide containing an irrelevant binding site , the c-fos SRE , had no effect on this protein-DNA complex .
Only a single complex was inhibited by the unlabeled EGR1 site-containing oligonucleotide , suggesting either that only one EGR family member was present in these extracts or that if multiple proteins bind specifically , they exhibit identical mobilities under the gel conditions used in this experiment .
To determine if this complex was due solely to EGR1 binding , we performed binding reactions in the presence of an antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide of EGR1 that is unique to EGR1 among members of this family ( 15 , 26 , 47 , 60 ) .
Prein-cubation with anti-EGR1 antiserum inhibited EGR1 site-spe-cific binding in a dose-dependent manner .
This result , taken together with the oligonucleotide competition data , indicated that extracts prepared from PMA-stimulated 1F1 cells do not contain detectable EGR2 , EGR3 , EGR4 , or WTI binding activities .
Thus , although they express egr-2 mRNA at detect-able , albeit low , levels ( Fig .
2B ) , protein levels are insufficient to form detectable complexes , indicating that EGR1 is the predominant DNA-binding protein from this family that is expressed in this system .
In summary , while 1F1 cells expressed both egr-1 message and protein following PMA and anti-u antibody stimulation , 231.7 cells do not manifest detectable expression following stimulation by these agents .
Increased CD44 mRNA expression by PMA or BCR stimulation correlates with EGR1 inducibility and is regulated at the level of transcription .
To evaluate the possibility that EGR1 is involved in the inducible transcription of CD44 , we compared CD44 mRNA levels in 231.7 and 1F1 cells in response to BCR signaling .
Three distinct CD44 transcripts ( cor-responding to published lengths of 1.3 , 2.7 , and 3.9 kb [ 5 ] ) were constitutively expressed at low levels in both cell lines ( Fig .
4A ) .
The presence of multiple transcripts is thought to be the result of alternative splicing ( 54 ) and differential polyadenyla-tion ( 57 ) .
Stimulation through the BCR with anti-p antibodies stimulated a marked increase in the levels of all three CD44 mRNAs in 1F1 cells .
An increase was also detectable in the 231.7 line , but the magnitude of this increase was much less than that observed with 1F1 cells .
In this experiment , inducible expression peaked at 4 h. To control for general increases in transcription and RNA loading , message levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH were measured .
GAPDH mRNA levels did not vary significantly between 1F1 and 231.7 cells nor Vou .

( A ) Time course of egr-1 RNA induction .
Ten micrograms of total cellular RNA isolated from 231.7 and 1F1 cells at the indicated times following exposure to PMA ( 10 ng/m ! )
was subjected to Northern blot analysis for egr-1 and GAPDH .
The locations of 28 $ and 188 rRNA bands are indicated .
( B ) Gel mobility shift assays were performed with 8 mg of nuclear extracts prepared from 231.7 and 1F1 cells stimulated for 2 h with 10 ng of PMA per ml .
The 65-bp *°P-labeled probe used contains a single EGR1 consensus binding site and flanking plasmid DNA .
Unlabeled oligonucleotide or anti-EGR1 antiserum was preincubated with nuclear extracts at 4°C for 15 min , the probe was added , binding was allowed to proceed for an additional 15 min at room temperature , and the reactions were separated through a 4 % polyacrylamide-0.5 % TBE gel .
following stimulation of these cells .
Similar differential induction of CD44 was also seen when PMA was used as a stimulus ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , induction of CD44 message following either PMA or anti-p antibody stimulation correlates with the capacity of these cells to express EGR1 .
The differential levels of CD44 RNA detected by Northern analysis could be due either to increased rates of transcription or to differences in CD44 RNA stability or to both .
A direct role for the EGR1 transcription factor implies effects at the level of CD44 transcription .
To evaluate the importance of induced transcription of the CD44 gene to the increase in mRNA levels , measurements of de novo transcription were performed by using nuclear run-on assays .
Transcription of CD44 in 1F1 cells was induced within 1 h of PMA stimulation ( Fig .
5A ) .
Consistent with the kinetics of steady-state RNA induction ( Fig .
4 and data not shown ) , the rate of CD44 transcription peaked between 1 and 3 h following stimulation .
To compare levels of transcription at different times between the two cell lines , we quantitated the band intensities and normalized these values to the transcription of GAPDH ( Fig .
5B ) .
Stimulation indices indicated that CD44 transcription was induced approximately 5-fold within 2 h in 1F1 cells , while less than 1.3-fold induction was seen at any time with 231.7 cells ( Fig .

PMA rapidly induces nuclear EGR1 protein .
EMSA were carried out with 5 pg of nuclear extracts from 1F1 cells which had been stimulated with PMA for the times indicated above each lane .
The extracts were incubated with a -labeled oligonucleotide probe containing two consensus EGR1 binding sites for 15 min ; this was followed by separation on a 4 % polyacrylamide-0.5 % TBE gel and autoradiography .

would expect that egr-l-specific transcription would precede that of CD44 .
The rate of egr-1 transcription was induced by greater than 18-fold within 1 h following PMA treatment of 1F1 cells ( Fig .
5A ) .
Among the times examined , maximal levels of egr-1 transcription were attained at 1 h ( versus 2 h for CD44 ) , decreasing over the next 3 h. As expected , egr-1 transcription in 231.7 cells was not detectable ( data not shown ) .
The kinetics of nuclear EGR1 protein correlate with CD44 transcription .
Although the kinetics of egr-1 transcription correlate with the transcription of CD44 , the relevance of EGR1 as a transcriptional activator of the CD44 gene depends on the kinetics of EGR1 protein available in the nucleus .
To address whether EGR1 protein is induced with appropriate kinetics to regulate CD44 transcription ( i.e .
, within 1 to 2 h ) , 1F1 cells were stimulated with PMA for varying periods of time and nuclear extracts were used for EMSA with an oligonucleotide probe containing two tandem EGR1 consensus binding motifs ( Fig .
6 ) .
No detectable EGR1 binding was seen with unstimulated 1F1 cells or with cells stimulated for 15 min .
However , nuclear EGR1 protein could be detected beginning within 30 min following PMA stimulation , with binding activity continuing to increase until 2 h following stimulation .
The kinetics of EGR1 binding activity , therefore , closely parallel the induction of CD44 specific transcription ( Fig .
5 ) .
EGR-1 binds with low affinity to a site at bp -301 of the CD44 promoter region .
While EGR1 is present in the nucleus with appropriate kinetics to regulate CD44 transcription , this regulation presumes the ability of the EGR1 protein to specifically interact with the CD44 promoter .
Sequence analysis of the human CD44 promoter indicated two potential EGR1 binding motifs centered at bp -600 and -301 , relative to the translation start site .
Since each of these elements differs from the consensus binding site by at least 1 bp , we carried out in vitro binding studies to determine binding of EGR1 to DNA Mor .

fragments containing each of these elements .
Preliminary EMSA experiments using large ( approximately 100-bp ) fragments which included the potential EGR1 motifs showed an EGR1-specific band shift of a fragment containing the bp -301 motif but not the bp -600 motif ( 34a ) , thereby ruling out the site at bp -600 as a potential mediator of EGR1-regulated CD44 expression .
Because the motif located at bp -301 is a nonconsensus binding motif , further studies using a synthetic oligonucleotide were carried out to confirm EGR1 binding and to compare the affinity of EGR1 for this sequence to that of the consensus .
Our system utilizing the 231.7 and 1F1 cell lines offers the advantage of determining EGR1 binding by using murine nuclear extracts rather than in vitro-synthesized or bacterially expressed protein .
If EGR1 binds to the DNA probe , a shifted band unique to nuclear extracts of stimulated 1F1 cells should be present .
Nuclear extracts from PMA-stimulated 231.7 and 1F1 cells were used in gel mobility shift assays with a labeled oligonucleotide probe spanning bp -288 to -307 of the CD44 promoter .
Incubation of the probe with stimulated extracts from 231.7 cells resulted in two shifted complexes ( Fig .
7 , lane 2 ) .
The high-mobility complex was not inhibited by excess unlabeled probe and was attributed to nonspecific binding ( data not shown ) .
Competition analysis with unlabeled oligonucleotides for Spl and EGR1 indicated that the low-mobility complex was due to Spl binding ( Fig .
7 , lanes 2 to 4 ) .
Use of stimulated extracts from 1F1 cells resulted in the appearance of an additional low-mobility complex ( Fig .
7 , lane 5 ) .
This complex was specifically inhibited by EGR1 consensus oligonucleotides but not Sp1 or AP1 oligonucleotides ( Fig .
7 , compare lane 7 and lanes 6 and 8 ) in other experiments and comigrated with a band specifically inhibited with an EGR1-specific antibody ( data not shown ) .

EGR1 binds to a region at bp -301 within the human CD44 promoter .
Five micrograms of nuclear extracts prepared from 231.7 ( lanes 2 to 4 ) and 1F1 ( lanes 5 to 10 ) cells which had been stimulated with 10 ng of PMA per ml for 2 h was tested for binding to a *°P-labeled oligonucleotide probe spanning bp -288 through -307 of the CD44 promoter .
Unlabeled oligonucleotides containing an Sp1 binding site ( lanes 3 and 6 ) , two EGR1 binding sites ( lanes 4 and 7 ) , an AP1 binding site ( lane 8 ) , and antisera specific for EGR1 ( lane 9 ) or CDK4 ( lane 10 ) were preincubated with the nuclear extracts for 15 min at 4°C prior to the addition of the probe .
Binding reactions were carried out for 15 min at room temperature and were followed immediately by separation of binding reaction mixtures on either a 6 % X Tris-glycine gel ( lanes 1 to 7 ) or a 4 % polyacrylamide-0.5 % X TBE gel .

The affinity of EGR1 for the nonconsensus motif at bp -301 of the CD44 promoter is lower than that for the consensus binding motif .
EMSA were performed with 5 ug of nuclear extracts from 1F1 cells stimulated for 2 h with 10 ng of PMA per ml and a °P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing two EGR1 consensus binding motifs .
To assess the relative affinity of EGR1 to different binding motifs , unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors containing two EGR1 consensus motifs ( lanes 3 to 6 ) or the nonconsensus binding motif at bp -301 were titrated into the binding reaction mixtures .
The molar excess of unlabeled EGR1 binding sites for each competition is indicated above each lane .
The competitor used in lanes 11 and 12 contains a 3-bp mutation in the bp -301 binding motif .
Binding reaction mixtures were separated on a 4 % polyacrylamide-0.5 % TBE gel , and the dried gel was autoradiographed .
this motif is EGR1 ( Fig .
3B ) , we inferred that this complex must be due to EGR1 .
To formally show that this complex was the result of EGR1 binding rather than that of another family member , we carried out antibody blocking experiments .
Antibodies directed to the unique C terminus of this family member ( 15 , 26 , 44 , 56 ) but not a control antiserum ( against CDK-4 ) specifically blocked formation of the complex specific to 1F1 extracts ( Fig .
5 , compare lanes 9 and 10 ) .
To determine the relative affinities of EGR1 for the bp -301 motif and the EGR1 consensus motif , nuclear extracts from 1F1 cells were again used as a source of cellular EGR1 .
The extracts were incubated with an oligonucleotide containing two tandem EGR1 binding motifs , and binding was inhibited with a titration of cold competitor oligonucleotides ( Fig .
8 ) .
Addition of as little as a 50-fold molar excess of consensus EGR1 motifs resulted in a complete inhibition ( Fig .
8 , lanes 3 to 6 ) .
In contrast , a 200- to 1,000-fold molar excess of the nonconsensus ( bp -301 ) binding site was necessary to achieve complete inhibition ( Fig .
8 , compare lanes 7 to 10 and lanes 3 to 6 ) .
The addition of an oligonucleotide containing a mutated EGR1 motif resulted in no competition , even at the higher concentration ( Fig .
8 , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
On the basis of the number of EGR1 binding sites needed to inhibit binding to the probe , EGR1 has an estimated 4- to 10-fold-higher binding affinity for the consensus than for the bp -301 nonconsensus motif .
Expression of EGR1 induces CD44 promoter activity .
Determination that EGR1 binds to the bp -301 site on the CD44 gene provided a mechanism for the direct interaction of the EGR1 transcription factor and the CD44 promoter .
To directly assess the role of EGR1 in the induced transcription of the CD44 gene , we performed transient cotransfection analysis with a CD44 promoter-CAT reporter fusion and a vector containing the murine egr-1 gene under the transcriptional control of the B-actin promoter .
This analysis was begun by using a reporter construct containing both the bp -600 and -301 binding sites ( although our studies discussed above indicate that the bp -600 site is unable to bind EGR1 ) and extending 3 ' through the CD44 transcription initiation site ( pSacBCAT ) ( 57 ) .
Multiple cotransfections with an egr-1 expression vector and pSacBCAT in 231.7 cells gave a level of CAT activity which was below the sensitivity of our assay ( data not shown ) .
The lack of detectable expression was attributed to a combination of low intrinsic promoter activity coupled with , more importantly , the low transfection efficiency of murine B lymphocytes .
To enhance the level of basal transcription , the region spanning bp -701 through -151 was cloned upstream of the minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter to generate pBLCD44 .
The -701 to -151 region retains both the bp -600 and -301 regions as well as the two Sp1 binding sites and the API site but does not include the putative endogenous CD44 transcription initiation sites ( Fig .
9A ) .
Because we were using a human promoter construct in murine cells , we tested the ability of both human EGR1 and murine EGR1 to transactivate the CD44 promoter .
Cotransfection of pBLCD44 with an expression vector for the murine EGR1 ( pAC-mEGR1 ) or the human EGR1 ( pAC-hEGR1 ) resulted in 5- and 7-fold inductions of CAT activity , respectively , compared with that for the empty expression vector ( Fig .
9B ) .
In a subsequent experiment , mutation of the bp -301 site ( see Fig .
10A ) was shown to abolish the ability of EGR1 to transactivate the transfected CD44 promoter-CAT construct .
In this experiment , transfection of the wild-type CD44-CAT reporter with pAC-hEGR1 resulted in a 2-fold induction of CAT activity in 231.7 cells , while the same reporter with a mutated bp -301 EGR1 binding site exhibited no induction ( 1.1-fold ) .
Although inducible activity was relatively low in this experiment , the results clearly establish the necessity for the integrity of this site for EGR1 transactivation .
These results , together with DNA binding data ( Fig .
7 ) , indicate that EGR1 binding to the CD44 promoter at bp -301 results in the induction of CD44 transcription .

Ten micrograms of pSV , PAP was included to control for transfection efficiency .
Amounts of acetylated and nonacetylated chloramphenicol were measured from thin-layer chromatography plates by PhosphorImager analysis , and percent conversion was calculated as described in Materials and Methods .
All values were corrected for transfection efficiency by using placental alkaline phosphatase activity .
The EGR1 binding motif at bp -301 of the CD44 promoter is necessary for full transcriptional induction .
The importance of the EGR1 binding motif during stimulus-induced transcription of CD44 was assessed by introducing a 3-bp mutation into the bp -301 motif in pBLCD44 ( Fig .
10A ) .
The mutated motif retained the ability to bind Sp1 ( data not shown ) but no longer bound EGR1 ( Fig .
8 , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
The two CD44 report-ers , pBLCD44 and the mutated pBLmCD44 , were used in transient transfection experiments in primary , nontransformed B lymphocytes previously stimulated with LPS for 72 h to increase transfection efficiently ( 37 ) .
This system was necessary for these studies because stimulation of EGR1-expressing 1F1 cells results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at 24 h , contra-indicating its use in a 24-h CAT assay .
However , even more important , the use of LPS-pretreated cells allowed the investigation of EGR1 regulation of the CD44 promoter in a nontransformed B-cell population at physiological levels of endogenous EGR1 protein .
Although basal levels of CD44 mRNA were higher in these cells than in unstimulated B lymphocytes , stimulation with either PMA or BCR cross-linking nonetheless induced increased message levels of CD44 ( data not shown ) .
CAT activity was increased ( 3.3-fold ) when LPS-pretreated cells were transfected with pBLCD44 and stimulated with PMA for 24 h ( Fig .
10B ) .
In contrast , stimulation of pBLmCD44 transfected cells resulted in only minimal ( 1.1-fold ) and insignificant ( P < 0.01 ) induction .
The presence of an intact EGR1 binding motif , therefore , was necessary for full transcriptional induction of this gene when physiological levels of EGR1 were mediating this response .
Furthermore , the apparent complete abrogation of transcriptional induction by mutation of the EGR1 binding site argues that other potential transcription factors that may be induced by stimulation of these cells play insignificant roles in the regulation of this promoter under these conditions .
DISCUSSION Stimulation of B lymphocytes through the BCR initiates a set of second-messenger pathways leading to the rapid and transient induction of immediate-early genes , many of which encode transcription factors ( 28 , 39 , 42 ) .
Through their ability to regulate expression of stimulus- and tissue-specific genes , the protein products of these genes are believed to function to translate these second-messenger pathways into the alterations of phenotype and activation state that accompany specific cellular responses ( 35 ) .
Identification of the target genes for proteins encoded by specific immediate-early genes is an approach to understanding how BCR-induced signals affect B-cell phys- Vou .

iology .
We have identified the CD44 gene as a target of EGR1 regulation in antigen receptor-stimulated B lymphocytes .
This finding provides insight into a key element , allowing us to trace BCR-initiated signaling pathways to a defined B-cell pheno-typic change that is relevant to its participation in an immune response .
Our evidence for EGR1 regulation of CD44 expression is based upon an experimental system which allows comparisons of gene regulation in subclones of a single B-cell line .
To the extent that we have been able to evaluate , these subclones differ only in their ability to express egr-1 .
Using these sub-clones , we have shown that expression of EGR1 correlates with the ability of BCR signaling to promote induction of transcription from the endogenous CD44 gene .
In addition , nuclear extracts from cells containing EGR1 , but not those from cells deficient in EGR1 , have a binding activity with an identified EGR1 binding motif in the CD44 promoter .
Transient transfection assays with a CD44 promoter-CAT reporter construct definitively show that EGR1 upregulates transcription of the CD44 gene and that the EGR1 binding motif located at bp -301 is necessary for full induction in primary , nontransformed B-cell blasts .
The transient transfections described in this report were carried out by using a chimeric reporter in which the 5 `` flanking region of the CD44 gene regulated transcription from a minimal promoter containing the heterologous herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase TATA box as a transcription start site .
Multiple transfection experiments using a reporter ( pSacBCAT ) which uses the CD44 transcription start site resulted in no detectable CAT activity with either 231.7 or LPS-pretreated B lymphocytes even though this promoter is active in murine NIH 3T3 cells ( 33a ) .
We believe that a combination of the low transfection efficiency of B lymphocytes and the low promoter activity results in transcriptional activity below the level of detection with our assay .
Chimeric reporters with promoter fragments driving heterologous promoters are commonly used to investigate gene regulation .
We can not rule out the possibility that regulation of the chimeric pBLCD44 reporter is different from either that of pSacBCAT or that of the endogenous CD44 gene ; however , the data obtained from transient transfections of pBLCD44 complement our studies with the WEHI-231 subclones in which regulation is mediated through the normal CD44 promoter in its relevant chromosomal con-text .
In the WEHI-231 system , PMA-induced transcription and anti-p antibody-induced transcription from the endogenous CD44 promoter are dependent on the presence of EGR1 .
In cells that lack EGR1 ( 231.7 ) , a minimal increase in transcription was observed following stimulation .
Similarly , transcriptional induction of the promoter construct was dependent on the presence of an intact EGR1 binding site ( pBLCD44 versus pBLmCD44 , Fig .
10 ) .
Thus , anti-p antibody-induced transcription and PMA-induced transcription of CD44 require an interaction between EGR1 and the EGR1 binding site at bp -301 of the promoter .
Identification of EGR1 target genes has been limited to date , resulting in the identification of a small number of large-ly , but not exclusively , tissue-specific genes ( 1 , 20 , 33 , 46 ) .
Many of these EGR1-regulated genes are rich in G+C content and lack 2292 MALTZMAN ET AL .
the TATA and CCAAT elements classically found in eukary-otic promoters .
Similarly , the human CD44 promoter lacks both TATA and CCAAT elements , and the region between bp +1 and -701 ( investigated in this report ) contains approximately 65 % G+C ( 57 ) .
The promoter contains three Sp1 sites and two EGR 1-like motifs within 1 kb of the start site ; EGR1 binds detectably only to the bp -301 site .
The 9-bp consensus binding motif for EGR1 was originally identified mainly on the basis of experiments using bacterially expressed or in vitro-translated EGR1 protein , often not utilizing the entire coding sequence ( 7 , 12 , 48 ) .
More recently , a systematic PCR-based approach was taken to redefine and extend these studies ( 62 ) .
While this study indicated that there is more variability in the binding sequence than previously appreciated and that flanking sequences play a role in binding site affinity , it also utilized bacterially expressed proteins .
One previous study has addressed the DNA binding specificity of cellular EGR1 ( 7 ) and showed low-affinity binding of a cellular factor to the nonconsensus motif found at bp -279 of the egr-1 promoter ( which is identical to the nonamer at bp -301 of the CD44 promoter ) .
This factor was not conclusively shown to be EGR1 and may have been a related family member .
We have demonstrated binding of mammalian EGR1 to the nonconsensus motif located at bp -301 by using a combination of nuclear extracts that differ in respect to EGR1 and antibody blocking .
In addition , consistent with findings obtained with synthetic EGR1 protein ( 6 ) , the affinity of EGR1 for this motif is lower than that for the consensus EGR1 binding motif ( Fig .
8B ) .
The low affinity of EGR1 for this site may affect competition between EGR1 and Spl for binding to this motif .
Overlapping EGR1-Spl1 binding motifs are common in EGR1-regulated genes , and competition of these factors for the site plays a role in regulation of some of these ( 1 , 16 ) .
We have not formally addressed competition between these two factors for this motif .
The Sp1 sites were shown to be functionally significant in expression of this gene in neuroblastoma cells ( 57 ) .
While data do not support a role for Sp1 in the inducible expression of CD44 , it is possible that Sp1 is important for basal expression of CD44 .
Consistent with this possibility are the observations that Sp1 is constitutively expressed in nearly all cell types ( 14 , 52 ) and that previous studies implicating a role for Sp1 in CD44 regulation ( 57 ) have only evaluated noninducible expression .
Previous studies of the transcriptional regulation of CD44 in cloned embryo rat fibroblast cells have implicated the API site in ras-dependent induction of CD44 ( 24 ) .
Although our studies do not specifically address the importance of this site in B lymphocytes , we have found that there is little if any stimula-tion-dependent increase in CAT activity from pBLCD44 in the absence of EGR-1 binding in primary B cells ( Fig .
10B ) .
This does not rule out a role for API in B-lymphocyte regulation of CD44 .
It is possible that AP1 and EGR1 are both necessary for optimal transcription and that the lack of either transcription factor results in a reduction in transcription .
It should be noted here that we do not consistently observe a difference in CD44 inducibility in anti-p antibody-stimulated splenic B cells from normal and EGR1-deficient mice ( 29 ) .
However , given that egr-1 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor and given its diverse role in cellular proliferation and differentiation , it is probable that other family members that bind to the same sites and are similarly ubiquitously expressed , such as egr-2 and egr-3 , are likely to compensate for a loss in egr-1 expression ( 29 ) .
Importantly , egr-2 and egr-3 are expressed in murine splenic B cells ( Fig .
2 ) ( unpublished data ) .

opmental and physiological processes are unlikely to be defin-itive , given the enormous selective pressure for compensation to ensure viable offspring .
In the specific case discussed here , perhaps a better approach would be to use the recombinase gene-defective mouse system so that the targeted gene could be restricted to cells of the T and B lineages .
However , even potential effects on cell development could complicate these studies .
CD44 has been hypothesized to play a role in both physiological and pathologic cellular migration and trafficking .
Several tumor models have implicated splice variants of CD44 in increased metastatic potential ( 24 , 50 ) .
In nontransformed lymphocytes , CD44 has been implicated in lymphocyte extrav-asation into secondary lymphoid tissue ( 58 ) .
In vitro , cell adhesion models have demonstrated that CD44 is the primary cell surface receptor for HA ( 2 ) .
In vivo stimulation of B lymphocytes leads to the increased expression of a number of cell surface proteins , including CD44 , that are involved in lymphocyte homing and migration .
CD44 protein levels are increased within 24 h following stimulation through the BCR on primary cells ( 5 ) .
However , the relationship of B-lymphocyte CD44 surface levels and the ability to bind HA is complex .
Differences in N glycosylation of newly synthesized CD44 have been implicated in the ability to bind HA ( 22 , 27 , 32 ) .
While a signal through the BCR complex is sufficient to increase the density of surface CD44 on B lymphocytes , affinity for HA does not increase in the absence of additional signals such as the presence of interleukin-5 ( 15 , 22 , 26 , 47 , 60 ) .
Activated B lymphocytes , with high levels of CD44 transcription , could receive this additional signal upon entering the appropriate secondary lymphoid tissue and begin expressing modified ( HA-binding ) CD44 .
Both increased transcription of the gene ( the result of BCR cross-linking ) and an alteration in the posttranslational milieu of the cell ( due to an interleukin-5 signal ) would be necessary to allow increased HA binding and retention in the lymphoid tissue .
In summary , the results presented in this paper offer evidence of a linkage between BCR-induced biochemical changes and downstream alterations in B-lymphocyte phenotype .
It is likely that EGR1 participates in the transcriptional regulation of numerous other genes involved in the B-lymphocyte activation response .
It is perhaps interesting that we have recently identified another EGR1 target gene in BCR-stimulated B cells ( 34 ) .
This gene , Icam-1 , like the CD44 gene , encodes an adhesion molecule involved in the B-cell-mediated immune response .
This suggests the possibility that EGR1 is involved in the coordinate regulation of cellular interaction proteins involved in early phases of the humoral immune response .
