Box 85500 , 3508 GA Utrecht , The Netherlands , §Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research , University of Utrecht , Padualaan 8 , 3584 CH Utrecht , The Netherlands , and the Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology , Russian Academy of Sciences , 142292 Pushchino , Moscow Region , Russia Two groups of HMG box proteins are distinguished .
Proteins in the first group contain multiple HMG boxes , are non-sequence-specific , and recognize structural features as found in cruciform DNA and cross-over DNA .
The abundant chromosomal protein HMG-1 belongs to this subgroup .
Proteins in the second group carry a single HMG box with affinity for the minor groove of the heptamer motif AACAAAG or variations thereof .
A solution structure for the non-sequence-specific C-terminal HMG box of HMG-1 has recently been proposed .
Now , we report the solution structure of the sequence-specific HMG-box of the SRY-related protein Sox-4 .
NMR analysis demonstrated the presence of three a-helices ( Val ' `` -Gin `` , Glu®®-Leu* and Phe `` `` -Tyr©© ) connected by loop regions ( Ser®®-Ala* and Leu®-Pro* ) .
Helices I and II are positioned in an antiparallel mode and form one arm of the HMG box .
Helix III is less rigid , makes an average angle of about 90° with helices I and II , and constitutes the other arm of the molecule .
As in HMG1B , the overall structure of the Sox-4 HMG box is L-shaped and is maintained by a cluster of conserved , mainly aromatic residues .
The cloning of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF ( 1 ) has originally led to the recognition of a novel type of DNA-binding domain , the so-called HMG box .
The HMG box was named after its homology with high mobility group ( HMG ) -1 proteins and is defined by a loose consensus sequence of about 80 amino acids ( 2 ) .
At this moment , more than 60 proteins with one or more HMG boxes have been reported .
An evolutionary study of the HMG box family indicated that two major subfamilies can be discriminated ( 8 ) .
One of these subfamilies contains proteins with a single HMG box , which binds with high sequence specificity to variants of the DNA sequence ( A/T ) Y ( A/ZT ) CAAAG .
Members of this subfamily include products of the mammalian sex determinator Sry and related Sox genes ( Sry HMG box-containing genes ) ( 4 , 5 ) , the Schizosaccharomy-ces pombe transcription factor Ste11+ ( 6 ) , the lymphoid factors TCF-1 ( 7 , 8 ) and LEF-1 ( 9 , 10 ) , and the products of several * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

fungal mating type genes such as Mat-Mc of S. pombe ( 11 ) and Mt a1 of Neurospora crassa ( 12 ) .
DNA binding occurs in the minor groove , as was shown for TCF-1 , LEF-1 , Mat-Mc , SRY , and Sox-4 by methylation- and diethyl-pyrocarbonate carboxylation interference footprinting and T ( C/A ) I nucleotide substitutions ( 13-16 ) and is accompanied by the induction of a strong bend in the DNA helix ( 14 , 16-18 ) .
A bend-swap experiment demonstrated that LEF-1 and its specific DNA-binding motif can functionally replace bending induced by the integration host factor at the aftP locus in phage A integrase reaction ( 16 ) .
The other subfamily includes proteins with multiple HMG boxes and with a rather nonspecific affinity for DNA , such as the HMG-1 and -2 proteins ( 19 ) , UBF ( 1 ) and mtTF1l ( 20 ) .
Characteristic of these HMG boxes is their affinity for the cis-platinated -GG- adduct in DNA ( 21 , 22 ) and cruciform DNA ( 23 , 24 ) , independent of sequence determinants .
This suggested that the non-sequence-specific HMG boxes recognize DNA structure instead of DNA sequence ( 25 ) .
Circular dichroism measurements and secondary structure prediction methods indicated a high « -helical content for sequence-specific HMG domains ( 17 ) .
This is consistent with NMR studies on the tertiary structure of the second HMG box of HMG1 ( 26 , 27 ) and HMG-D ( 28 ) .
The 60-amino acid core of these non-sequence-specific HMG boxes consists of three a-hel-ices , which form an unusual L-shaped molecule .
The angle between the two arms is 70-80° and is defined by a cluster of conserved , aromatic residues ( 26-28 ) .
Based on an identical secondary structure observed for the HMG box of Sox-5 , a similar L-shaped structure has been suggested for this sequence-specific HMG domain ( 29 ) .
Hydrophobic interactions of the HMG box of SRY with DNA by partial isoleucine side chain intercalation predicts the positioning of an a-helix into a widened minor groove and might account for sequence specificity and DNA bending ( 30 ) Using the solution structure of rat HMG1B ( 26 ) a model for the SRY-DNA complex was proposed ( 81 ) .
Since a detailed structure for a sequence-specific HMG box has not yet been determined , we have pursued the elucidation of the NMR solution structure of the HMG box domain of the lymphocyte transcriptional activator Sox-4 .
This HMG box shows high sequence-specific binding toward the AACAAAG DNA-binding motif with a K , , of 107 `` m ( 15 ) .
The biological significance of the Sox-4 gene has recently been underscored in a gene disruption experiment .
Mice carrying two null alleles of Sox-4 fail to develop functional valves in the heart and have a severe block in early lymphoid development . ``
The NMR data indicate that the secondary structure of Sox-4 HMG box is 2 M. Schilham , P. Moerer , and H. Clevers , unpublished results .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid Construction-The Sox-4 HMG box was cloned by PCR from pSox-4 DNA using the primers 5-ATACATATGGCTAAGACGC-CCAGTGGCCAC-3 ' - and 5-CCCGGATCCTACGACCTTCTTTCG-3 ' and inserted between the Nde !
and BamHI sites of pET-3¢ ( 82 , 33 ) .
The identity of the subcloned HMG-box fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing .
The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) .
Production and Purification of the Sox-4 HMG Box Peptide-The production and purification of the Sox-4 HMG box peptide was basically done as described for the HMG box of TCF-1 ( 17 ) .
For the production of unlabeled HMG box peptide the transformed cells were grown at 37° C in LB , while for the production of uniformly protein the cells were grown in minimal medium containing Both media contained 100 pg/ml ampicillin .
In the midlog phase the cells were induced with 0.3 mM isopropyl-1-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside .
After 3 h of induction the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation ( 20 min , 4000 x g , 4° C ) and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer ( 50 mm Tris-HCl , 1 mx EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 250 mM NaCl , 5 mm dithiothreitol , 4 mm CaCl , , 40 mM MgC ] , , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , pH 8.0 ) .
Next , Triton X-100 ( final concentration 0.1 % ( v/v ) ) was added , and the cells were lysed by sonification ( 10 x 2 min , 4° C ) .
To reduce the viscosity of the cell lysate , the DNA was broken down with DNase I ( 10 ug/ml ! )
for 15 min at room temperature .
The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation ( 15 min , 15,000 x g , 4° C ) .
The DNA in the supernatant was precipitated with polyethyleneimine ( final concentration 0.2 % ( v/v ) ) .
The HMG box peptide was collected in a 60 % ( NH , ) ,80 , precipitation .
The precipitate was resolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl , 1 mm EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM NaN , , 5 mM dithiothreitol , and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , pH 7.5 , and dialyzed against the same buffer at 4° C. The dialyzed protein solution was applied to a 30 x 1-cm Accell Plus CM cation exchange column ( Waters ) .
The Sox-4 HMG box was eluted from the column with a 0.1-1 M NaCl gradient .
The Sox-4 HMG box fractions were pooled , concentrated , and taken up in the desired buffer by Ami-con ultrafiltration .
SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis-The purity of the isolated protein was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a Pharmacia PhastSystem using precast 20 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels .
The gels were developed by silver staining .
Protein Sequencing-The identity of the isolated protein was also checked by analysis of the first 10 amino acids of the protein sequence ( 34 ) using an Applied Biosystems model 476A protein sequencing system .
Gel Retardation Analysis-The biological activity was tested in a gel retardation experiment .
For this purpose annealed oligonucleotides were labeled by T4 kinase with [ y-*°P ] ATP .
The probes were purified by nondenaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis .
For a typical binding reaction , 10 ng of purified protein was incubated in a volume of 15 ul containing 10 mM Hepes , 60 mM KCl , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , and 12 % glycerol .
After a 5-min incubation at room temperature , probe ( 10,000-20,000 cpm , equalling 1 ng ) was added , and the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min .
The samples were than electro-phoresed through a nondenaturing 8 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 % TBE at room temperature .
The oligonucleotide probes were MWe-1 ( d ( GGGAGACTGAGAA-CAAAGCGCTCTCACAC ) annealed to d ( CCCGTGTGAGAGCGCTTT-GTTCTCAGTCT ) ) and MWe-lsac ( d ( GGGAGACTGAGCCGCGGT-CGCTCTCACAC ) annealed to d ( CCCGTGTGAGAGCGACCG-CGGCTCaAGTCT ) .
Circular Dichroism Experiments-CD measurements were performed on a Jasco-600 spectropolarimeter equipped with a tempera-ture-controlled water bath .
The CD signal was calibrated with d-10 camphor sulfonic acid ( 85 ) .
The spectrum represents an average of 10 scans .
The CD spectra were fitted as described elsewhere ( 36 ) .
The CD measurements were done at 293 K in 10 mM sodium phosphate , 100 mM NaCl , and 1 mM sodium azide , pH 7.4 .
The protein concentration of the CD sample was 48 uM .
NMR Experiments-NMR samples ( 95 % H , O , 5 % D,0 ) contained 1-2 mM Sox-4 HMG box in 10 mM sodium phosphate , 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM sodium azide , pH 6.5 .
NMR spectra were recorded on 500 and 600 MHz Bruker AMX spectrometers at 293 and 298 K. All spectra were required with solvent suppression during relaxation delay .
NOESY spectra ( 37 ) were recorded with a mixing times of 100 and 150 ms. TOCSY spectra ( 38 ) were 30517 recorded with a clean MLEV17 pulse sequence ( 89 ) and spin-locking times of 20 , 40 , 60 , and 85 ms. For these two-dimensional spectra 512 , increments each consisting of 96 transients per FID of 2048 data points were collected .
Two-dimensional ' `` N-*H HSQC spectra were collected with 121-860 ¢ , increments consisting of 2-144 transients per FID of 1024 data points .
Three-dimensional '*°N-*H NOESY-HSQC spectra of 184 ( t ; ) X 64 ( t , ) X 1024 ( ¢ , ) datapoints and 8 transients/FID with a mixing time of 150 ms and three-dimensional '°N- ' H TOCSY-HSQC spectra of 160 ( ¢ , ) X 64 ( ¢ , ) X 1024 ( ¢ , ) data points and 24 transients/ FID with spin-locking times of 50 ms and a clean MLEV1T7 pulse sequence were recorded .
Pulsed field gradients were used for artifact suppression ( 40 ) .
Fast exchange of amide protons with water were identified from the difference of a NH sensitivity-enhanced *N-HSQC experiment with and without presaturation ( 41 ) .
In this experiment 160 ( ¢ , ) X 1024 ( ¢ , ) points were collected . '
'' N backbone dynamics were determined using ' H-'°N heteronuclear NOE experiments ( 42 , 43 ) .
Gradient sensitivity-enhanced T ; p measurements ( 41 , 43 ) were done with relaxation times of 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 54 , 72 , 96 , 120 , 150 , and 192 ms .
The ' `` N magnetization was spin-locked in the transverse plane during the relaxation period using a spin-lock field strength of 2.5 kHz .
Spectra with 160 ( ¢ , ) X 1024 ( ¢ , ) data points were acquired .
The spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics workstation using the TRITON NMR software package developed at the Bijvoet Center , University of Utrecht .
The two-dimensional spectra were processed using a # /2-shifted sine-bell window for ¢ , and a # /3-shifted squared sine-bell window for ¢ , .
The ¢ , data of the two-dimensional spectra were zero-filled to 1024 points .
The three-dimensional spectra were processed using a # /2.5-shifted sine-bell window for ¢1 , a # /2-shifted sine-bell window for ¢ , , and a # /2.5-shifted squared sine-bell window for ?
; .
The ¢ , and ¢ , data of the three-dimensional spectra were also zero-filled to 256 and 128 points , respectively .
Fourth-order polynominal base-line corrections were applied in each frequency domain ( 44 ) .
The ' H chemical shift values were calibrated using the H , O resonance with a chemical shift of 4.81 relative to 3- ( trimethylsilyl ) propionate at 298 K ; the `` N chemical shift values were referred to the signal at 22.3 ppm at 293 K. The spectra were analyzed using the program ALISON developed at the Bijvoet Center , University of Utrecht ( 45 ) .
For the generation and analysis of Sox-4 HMG box structures In-sightII version 2.2.06 ( Biosym Technologies Inc. , San Diego , CA ) was used .
For distance geometry calculations we used the program DGII ( 46 ) .
Triangle smoothing for sequential pairs of residues with a wobble of 10° for the peptide bond planarity was used in generating the distance bounds matrix .
The structures were embedded by prospective metrization in four dimensions using a uniform probability distribution for selecting trial distances .
The fit of the embedded structures was improved by a weighted least-square fit of the distances in the newly embedded coordinates to the distances in the trial distance matrix using 10 Guttman transformations with constant distance weights .
For optimization the structures were submitted to 10,000 iterations of simulated annealing using an initial energy of 2500 keal/mol , a maximum temperature of 200 K , a time step of 0.2 ps , and atomic masses of 1 kDa .
Finally , the structures were submitted to 2500 iterations of conjugate gradient energy minimization .
The structures were refined further by restrained energy minimization and molecular dynamics using Discover version 2.8 ( Biosym Technologies Inc. , San Diego , CA ) .
The protocol consisted of an energy minimization phase using 500 iterations of steepest descent and 3000 iterations of conjugate gradient minimization , followed by molecular dynamics at 311 K of 10,000 iterations of 0.5 fs and a final energy minimization of 500 iterations of steepest descent and 2500 iterations of conjugate gradient minimization .
The consistent valence force field was used without cross-correlation terms and Morse potentials .
In the cal-culations , the weighting factors of all physical terms were set to 1 , and a distance restraint force constant of 300 keal-mol A `` with a maximum force of 2000 keal-mol~ `` A= ?
were used .
The peptide bonds were forced to trans with a force constant of 60 keal-mol `` rad * .
The stereochemical quality of the structures was checked with the program PROCHECK ( 47 ) .
RESULTS Expression , Purification , and Characterization of the HMG Box of Sox-4 The HMG box of murine Sox-4 ( amino acids 59-135 ) ( 15 ) was produced in a T7-based expression system ( 32 , 33 ) .
For this purpose a pET-3/Sox-4 HMG box plasmid was constructed .

This recombinant plasmid was transformed into £ .

The overexpressed HMG box peptide was purified to homogeneity in a single-step cation exchange chromatographic run .
A typical elution profile is presented in Fig .

CD spectrum of the Sox-4 HMG box peptide .
Deconvolution of the CD spectrum revealed an a-helical content of 54 % .
The CD spectrum was measured at 293 K in 10 mM sodium phosphate , 100 mM NaCl , and 1 mx sodium azide , pH 7.4 .
The protein concentration was 48 uM .
the protein was established in a gel retardation assay ( Fig .
1C ) .
Circular Dichroism Fig .
2 shows the CD spectrum of the HMG box peptide of Sox-4 .
Deconvolution of the spectrum predicted a secondary structure with 54 % a-helix , 11 % -sheet , and 35 % random coil .
A similar high a-helical content was observed for the HMG boxes of TCF-1 ( 17 ) , HMG1B ( 26 , 27 ) , HMG-D ( 28 ) , and Sox-5 ( 29 ) .
NMR Measurements Assignment-Unlabeled as well as uniformly '°N-labeled Sox-4 HMG box samples were used for NMR spectroscopy .
The NMR data were collected at pH 6.5 and at temperatures of 293 and 298 K. Conditions with a pH lower than 6.5 resulted in precipitation of the protein , while at temperatures above 298 K the protein starts to unfold .
The predominantly « -helical nature of the protein results in a limited chemical shift disper-sion .
This causes a severe overlap in the amide and fingerprint region of the NOESY and TOCSY spectra and makes it difficult to assign these spectra completely .
However , the ' N signals of the various residues are well separated in the two-dimensional '°N- ' H HSQC experiment ( Fig .
3 ) .
Therefore , we collected three-dimensional '°N- ' H NOESY-HSQC and three-dimensional *°N- ' H TOCSY-HSQC data at 293 and 298 K. The majority of sequential assignments of the amino acid spin systems was found by comparison of the amide region of three-dimensional '*°N- ' H NOESY-HSQC and three-dimensional *°N- ' H TOCSY-HSQC spectra .
In some cases additional information of NOESY , TOCSY , and/or two-dimensional HSQC spectra was helpful .
First , stretches of spin systems with sequential ' `` *NH- °NH and C , , H-*'°NH NOE contacts were identified in the three-dimensional '°N- ' H NOESY-HSQC spectrum ( Fig .
4 ) .
Assignment of these spin systems to specific residues was done by comparison of the amino acid side-chain resonances in the three-dimensional *°N- ' H NOESY-HSQC , three-dimensional ' `` N- ' H TOCSY-HSQC , NOESY , and TOCSY spectra .
Two-dimensional spectra were especially helpful for the assignment of the side chains of the aromatic residues .
Using this strategy we were able to assign more than 80 % of the backbone resonances of the HMG box .
The ' N and ' H chemical shift data are deposited at the BioMagResBank ( University of Wisconsin , Madison ) ( Table I ) .
Although we collected data sets at two temperatures ( 293 and 298 K ) , some residues at the N and C termini could not be identified , due to flexibility and/or overlap .

HSQC spectrum of the Sox-4 HMG box peptide .
The spectrum was recorded at 600 Mhz in 10 mM sodium phosphate , 100 mM NaCl , and 1 mM sodium azide , pH 6.5 .
The temperature was 293 K. W11 NH and W39 NH indicate the NH protons of the side chains of Trp and Trp `` , respectively .
One-letter amino acid codes are used .
30519 Secondary Structure-In total we found 426 identifiable interresidue NOE cross-peaks in the NOESY ( 100- and 150-ms mixing times ) and the three-dimensional '°N- ' H NOESY-HSQC ( 150-ms mixing time ) spectra : 256 sequential ( ¢ to ( ¢ + 1 ) ) , 106 medium range ( ¢ to > ( i + 2 ) and = < ( i + 4 ) ) , and 56 long range ( i to > ( i + 5 ) ) .
A similar low number of interresidue NOE contacts was found for the non-sequence-specific HMG-D box ( 28 ) , while for the HMG1B box about twice as many interre-sidual NOEs were observed ( 26 , 27 ) .
The observation of stretches of strong dyy ( ¢ , i + 1 ) and weak d.yn ( t , i + 1 ) connectivities in combination with duy ( t , i + 3 ) , dant , i + 4 ) , and « B @ , i + 3 ) contacts ( 48 ) in the three-dimensional '*°N- ' H NOESY-HSQC and NOESY spectra provided evidence for the existence of three « -helical regions in the Sox-4 HMG box .
The a-helices are formed by residues Val ' `` -Gin `` , Glu®-Leu* and Phe `` -Tyr© `` ( Fig .
5 ) .
Based on these NMR data an a-helical content of 53 % was calculated for the Sox-4 HMG box .
This is consistent with the analysis of the CD spectrum of the Sox-4 HMG box ( Fig .
2 ) , which revealed an a-helical content of 54 % ( see `` Circular Dichroism `` ) .
Fast and intermediate exchanging NH protons with water were identified from the difference of a NH sensitivity-enhanced **N-HSQC experiment with and without presaturation .
Fast exchanging NH protons are mainly found outside the helical regions with exception of helix III , which also contains a number of fast and intermediate exchanging NH protons ( Fig .
5 ) .
A more or less similar distribution of mobile backbone NH protons was observed in a heteronuclear NOE experiment ( Figs .
5 and 6A ) .
These observations are in accordance with a less rigid and more exposed character of helix III .

However , helix III is not flexible as indicated by the T ; , p relaxation times ( Fig .

The different time scale of NH exchange , ' H-**N NOE , and NH Tp relaxation explains the seemingly contradictory results .
Possible salt bridges between Arg `` and Glu* ' in helix I , between Arg** and Glu `` in helix II , and between Lys® `` and Asp in helix III might contribute to helix stabilization ( 49 ) .
Loop regions are located between Ser®® and Ala `` and between Leu** and Pro® ( Fig .
5 ) .
The N-terminal residues as well as the C-terminal amino acids between Pro® and Pro'* have an extended confor-mation , as was indicated by the observation of strong sequential dy and weak dyy contacts and the absence of most medium range NOE contacts ( 48 ) .
Turns involving 4 residues are characterized by a strong dyy ( 3,4 ) connectivity together with a 4.y ( 24 ) contact ( 48 , 50 ) .
Such a pattern was found in the sequence Leu* `` -Lys**-Asp**-Ser* `` .
A very strong dyy contact was observed between Asp** and Ser*® .
In addition , a + 2 ) contact with medium intensity was detected between and Ser* .
Type I and type II turns can be distinguished from each other by the intensity of the dyy ( 2,3 ) ( strong in type I , absent in type II ) and d. , y ( 2,3 ) ( weak in type I , strong in type II ) connectivities ( 48 ) .
Since Lys*® and Asp*4 show a weak dyy ( 2,3 ) contact and a d. , y ( 2,3 ) cross-peak with medium inten-sity , we were unable to classify this turn .
However , in our refined structure this sequence has a type I turn conformation ( see later ) .
In the sequence Ser®®-Pro `` *-Asp `` *-Met `` `` , just after helix I , we found a very strong dyy , contact between Asp `` and Met `` ° and a weak d.y ( 1,4 ) connectivity between Ser®* and Met `` , suggesting the presence of a turn .
Unfortunately , we were unable to identify a d.y ( 2,4 ) contact in this sequence , since the C , , H proton of Pro** was not assigned .
It is noted that this sequence has a type I turn structure in the final model ( see later ) .
The unassigned residues Arg*-Asn'® and Arg'*-Lys `` `` at the N and C termini are most probably flexible and unstructured .
Tertiary Structure-Long distance NOEs were only observed between a limited number of residues , which are located in the hydrophobic core of the HMG box peptide .
Ala `` , Phe° , Met `` , Val `` , and Trp `` are located at the N-terminal end of helix I and contact Trp `` and Leu* ' at the C-terminal end of helix II .
Amino acids Phe , and Ala `` located in the N-terminal end of helix III show NOEs with Val `` and Trp `` of helix I .
All interresidue NOE cross peaks were classified according to their intensities as strong , medium , or weak .
The corresponding distance restraints were 1.8-2.75 A ( strong ) , 1.8-3.175 A ( medium ) , and 1.8-5.25 A ( weak ) .
The three-dimensional structure was calculated using these experimental restraints in a distance geometry ( DG ) calculation followed by restrained molecular dynamics and energy minimization cal-culations .
The distribution of the NOE distance restraints against the residue number is shown in Fig .

From the resulting structures those with the lowest energy ( < 3000 keal/mol ) and with =6 distance violations of =0.1 A were selected .
The stereochemical quality of the structures was evaluated with the program PROCHECK ( 47 ) .
Those structures with n-amino acids and/or cis peptide bonds were also discarded .
A final set of 15 structures is presented in Fig .

The overall structure of the Sox-4 HMG box is L-shaped ( Fig .
8 ) .
Helix I ( Val ' `` -GIn* ? )
and II ( Glu®-Leu* ) are positioned in an antiparallel mode and form one arm of the molecule .
The position of helix III ( Phe*-Tyr© ? )
varies , makes an average angle of ~90° with helices I and II , and constitutes the other arm of the L-shaped HMG box .
The average pairwise RMSD value of the backbone atoms ( N , C , , , C ' ) of helix I ( Val `` -GIn `` ? )
and II ( Glu®-Leu* ) is 0.84 + 0.29 A .
As a result of the variable position of helix III this value goes up to 1.97 *+ 0.77 A when helix III is included .
However , the internal average pairwise RMSD of helix III ( Phe*-Tyr© ? )
is 0.76 + 0.26 A .
A similar pattern is observed when the RMSD value of the C , , backbone atoms is plotted against the residue number ( Fig .
9 ) .
In accordance with the T ; p relaxation times ( Fig .
6B ) , these data indicate that in these computations helix III forms a helical element whose position varies relative to helix I and II .
This variation is caused by the absence of long range NOE contacts between helix III and the other parts of the Sox-4 HMG box .

structure of Sox-4 HMG box .
Note that these residues with the exception of Lys* are conserved within the HMG box family ( 2 ) .
DISCUSSION Here , the NMR solution structure of the sequence-specific HMG box of Sox-4 is presented .
The overall L-shape structure compares well with that reported for the non-sequence-specific HMG boxes of HMG1B ( 26 , 27 ) and HMG-D ( 28 ) , which recognize structural features of DNA ( 25 ) .
As in the HMG1B and HMG-D , three « -helical regions dominate the HMG box structure of Sox-4 .
The sequential positions of helix I and II coincide with the corresponding helices in HMG1B ( 26 , 27 ) and HMG-D ( 28 ) .
Helix III is positioned between proline 49 and 66 and is 4 residues shorter than helix III of HMG1B ( 26 , 27 ) and HMG-D ( 28 ) .
Apparently , this results from the helix-breaking Pro® , which is unique to the sequence-specific HMG boxes ( 2 ) but is replaced by a structurally neutral alanine in HMG1B ( 26 , 27 ) and by lysine in HMG-D ( 28 ) .
The helices I and II are followed by loops that start with type I turns ( Ser®*-Met* `` `` after helix I and Leu*-Ser* after helix II ) .
The presence of such turns was not reported for HMG1B ( 26 , 27 ) and HMG-D ( 28 ) .
The overall HMG box fold is stabilized by a hydrophobic core involving residues Ala `` , Phe® , Val `` , and Trp `` , Trp `` , Leu* , and Phe `` `` .
With the exception of Leu* ' , these residues are conserved within the HMG box family , irrespective of their binding specificity ( 2 ) .
The structure of this hydrophobic core should be considered as the HMG box `` signature . ``
The mechanism of binding to DNA is fundamentally different for the two types of HMG boxes .
The non-sequence-specific HMG1B box binds to preexisting structures ( 25 ) , such as cruciform DNA ( 23 , 24 ) and DNA bent by the cis-platinum -GG-adduct ( 21 , 22 ) .
The binding of the HMG box proteins to cruciform DNA has not been reported to induce conformational changes in the DNA .
Therefore , it is likely that the rigid HMG1B-type box fits directly onto these unusual DNA struc-tures .
This is in contrast with the sequence-specific HMG box proteins , that alter the DNA conformation significantly .
The binding of a monomeric sequence-specific HMG box to the minor groove of a straight DNA helix ( 13-16 ) introduces a sharp bend ( on the order of 90° ) in the DNA helix as determined in circular permutation assays ( 14 , 16-18 ) .
This is supported by the dispersion of the **P resonances in the SRY-DNA complex ( 81 ) .
Exchange of the N- and C-terminal regions of the sequence-specific HMG box of hLEF-1 with those of non-sequence-specific HMG1B showed that the sequence specificity of hLEF-1 is maintained by the N- and C-terminal residues ( 51 ) .

The corresponding residue positions in Sox-4 are given in parentheses .
These mutations are mainly located in the N-terminal part of the HMG box .
( Fig .
9 ) .
Gly `` is located in helix II , and Lys* `` is positioned in the loop region between helix II and III .
( Fig .
9 ) .
Mutations in other parts of the HMG box such as F109S ( Phe `` `` ) in SRY ( 55 ) and V316L ( Met* `` ) , and Y346S ( Phe ) in LEF-1 ( 56 ) do not influence the binding prop-erties .
However , they can still disrupt the biological function of the protein as is demonstrated by the presence of the F109S8 ( Phe `` `` ) mutation in SRY of sex-reversed XY female ( 55 ) .
Of special interest is mutation M64I ( Met® ) in SRY , which shows an almost normal DNA-binding affinity , but decreases the DNA bending with 20° ( 55 ) .
The side chain of e® ( Met `` ) in the N-terminal region of the sequence-specific HMG box of SRY intercalates partially from the minor groove side between the two central AT base pairs of its d ( AACAATCA ) } d ( TGATTGTT ) heptamer motif ( 30 , 31 ) .
Note that in murine SRY and Sox-4 this interacting Ile is replaced by Met .
With this information a model for the SRY-DNA complex was constructed ( 31 ) .
Here , the concave surface of the HMG box of SRY , whose structure was based on the NMR solution structure of the non-sequence-specific HMG1B box , faces the bent DNA with helix I , which is docked in a widened minor groove .

of the HMG box of SRY ( 41 , 52-55 ) and LEF-1 ( 56 ) on the DNA binding ( see also above and Fig .
10 ) indicate that the N-terminal residues of the HMG box interact with the DNA .
On the other hand the results of methylation- and diethyl-pyrocarbonate carboxylation interference footprinting and T ( C/A ) I nucleotide substitutions ( 13-16 ) show that the HMG box interacts in the minor groove with the first 6 base pairs of the d ( AACAAAG ) Yd ( CTTTGTT ) consensus sequence .
Based on the notion that the N terminus of the HMG box interacts with the first 6 base pairs of the d ( AACAAAG ) d ( CTTTGTT ) binding sequence and the finding that Ie `` ( Met® ) of SRY intercalates between the two central AT base pairs of the d ( AACAATCA ) Yd ( TGATTGTT ) heptamer motif ( 30 , 31 ) , we add the proposal that in the HMG box-DNA complex the N terminus of the HMG box points in the direction of the 5 !
AT base pair of the d ( AACAAAG ) d ( CTTTGTT ) consensus binding sequence .
Considering the sequence homology between the HMG boxes of SRY and Sox-4 a similar model for the Sox-4 HMG box-DNA complex might be proposed .
However , a definitive model awaits the experimental determination of the structure of the complex of Sox-4 and DNA .
Note Added in Proof-After this manuscript was submitted , the structure of the DNA complex of SRY ( 57 ) and LEF-1 ( 58 ) was reported .
