Here we investigated the transcriptional basis for these changes .
The proenkephalin promoter contains a sequence GGGGACGTCCCC , named B2 , which is similar to the « B sequence GGGGACTTTCC , the binding site of the transcription factor nuclear factor ( NF ) - < B .
Activation of T lymphocytes induces an NF- « B-like binding activity to the B2 site , concomitant with activation of the proenkephalin promoter .
Mutations at the B2 site abolish this transcriptional activation .
The purified homodimer ( two pS50s ) of the DNA-binding subunit of NF- « B binds the B2 site of proenkephalin relatively better than does the heterotetramer ( two p6GSs plus two p50s ) form of the factor .
Thus , it appears that the T-cell-specific activation of the proenkephalin promoter is mediated by NF- « B .
However , as NF- « B is ubiquitous and the transcriptional activation through the B2 site is T cell specific , yet another T-cell-specific factor which synergizes with NF-xB should be considered .
Proenkephalin is a precursor for neuropeptides with a variety of functions in the neuroendocrine and nervous systems ( 1 ) .
Upon activation , T-helper lymphocytes were found to express high levels of proenkephalin mRNA and to secrete large amounts of the metenkephalin neuropeptide , perhaps indicating an axis by which the immune and nervous systems interact ( 33 ) .
Nuclear factor ( NF ) - « B is a transcription factor originally found to be expressed in mature B lymphocytes , in which it enhances the expression of the immunoglobulin x light-chain gene ( 28 ) .
Subsequently , NF-kB was found to be present in an inactive form in many cell types in which , upon a posttranslational activation step mediated by protein kinase C ( 8 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 29 ) or various other treatments ( 17 , 23 , 30 ) , it becomes active .
The biochemical basis for the activation of NF- « B was shown to involve dissociation of an inhibitory subunit , termed IkB , from the DNA-binding sub-unit ( s ) ( 3 , 4 ) .
Mitogenic stimulation of T lymphocytes also converts inactive NF- « B into its active form , which in turn induces the expression of kB sequence-containing genes such as human immunodeficiency virus ( 21 ) , interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) ( 14 ) , and the a subunit of the IL-2 receptor ( 7 ) .
The rat proenkephalin promoter region contains two sequences ( Bl and B2 , shown in Fig .
2a ) that are similar to kB , the binding site of NF-kB .
In this study , we show that NF- « B can bind to the proenkephalin promoter ( at the B2 site ) and that this binding is the cause for the expression of proenkephalin in activated T lymphocytes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein extracts and EMSA .
Whole-cell protein extracts were prepared as described previously ( 16 ) .
Briefly , 10-ml ( 2 x 10° to 4 x 10° cells per ml ) cultures were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 20 mM HEPES ( N-2-hydroxypiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfo-nic acid ) ( pH 7.9 ) -0.35 M NaCIl-20 % glycerol-1 mM * Corresponding author .
1017 MgCl , -1 % Nonidet P-40-1 mM dithiothreitol-0.5 mM EDTA-0.1 mM EGTA containing the following protease inhibitors : 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 ug of pepstatin A per ml , 10 pg of leupeptin per ml , 0.1 mM p-aminobenzamidine , and 1 mg of aprotinin per ml .
After 10 min of incubation on ice , the extract was centrifuged in an Eppendorf minicentrifuge for 15 min at 4°C and the super-natant was collected , frozen in liquid N ; , and kept at -130°C until thawed for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
For the EMSA , 6 wl of protein extract ( ~20 ug of protein ) was incubated for 20 to 30 min at room temperature in 30 pl of 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) -20 mM KCl-1 mM EDTA-1 mM B-mercaptoethanol-4 % glycerol-4 mg of poly ( dI-dC ) -20,000 to 50,000 Cerenkov counts per minute ( 0.5 ng ) of radioactively labeled DNA probe .
An equal volume of loading buffer ( 16 ) was added to the binding reaction mixture before electrophoresis through a 4 % native polyacrylamide gel ( 16 ) .
Purification of NF- « B and its assay by EMSA was as described previously ( 31 , 32 ) .
Plasmids and DNA fragments .
The following DNA fragments were used : « kB , the Xbal-EcoRI fragment containing the kB oligonucleotide subcloned into the BamHI site of pUC18 ( 16 ) ; B1 and mB1 , the XmnlI-Aval fragments containing the relevant sequences of pEPCAT ( wt ) and pEPCAT ( mB1B2 ) , respectively ( see Fig .
2a ) ; B2 and mB2 , the Aval-Pstl fragments containing the relevant sequences of the same plasmids ; x-2 , a fragment of the x light-chain gene enhancer , which was prepared as described previously ( 28 ) .
In the experiments shown in Fig .
3 , the B2 fragment was the oligonucleotide AGGGGACGTCCCCTTAGCA cloned into the PstI site of pGEM-2 .
For construction of the proenkephalin promoter-cat gene reporter plasmid , the Xbal-Sacl fragment spanning nucleo-tides -501 to +51 relative to the rat proenkephalin gene cap site ( 26 ) was subcloned into pGEM-2 .
Mutations were introduced by the oligonucleotide-directed gap heteroduplex technique ( 20 ) .
The bacterial cat gene was subsequently inserted at the Sacl site downstream of the cap site of either 1018 RATTNER ET AL .

B2 site of the proenkephalin promoter is recognized by an NF- « xB-like protein .
( a ) Whole-cell extracts from ConA-PMA-activated ( lanes 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , and 9 ) and nontreated control ( lanes 2 , 5 , 8 , and 10 ) Jurkat T cells were reacted with labeled DNA fragments containing the kB sequence ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , the proenkephalin B2 site ( lanes 3 to 5 ) , the mutated B2 site ( mB2 ) ( lanes 6 to 8 ) , and the x-2 fragment ( lanes 9 and 10 ) , which contains the recognition site of the ubiquitous factor NF-uE3 and was used to control for the amount of protein in the two types of extracts .
Lanes 4 and 7 present reactions in which an excess ( 50 ng ) of unlabeled kB fragment ( see below ) was included in the reaction .
Jurkat cells were treated for 24 h with PMA ( 100 nM , Sigma ) and ConA ( Sigma type IV , 50 ug/ml1 ) , after which protein extracts were prepared from them as described in Materials and Methods .

The extract was reacted with the kB probe ( lane 1 ) , the B1 probe without ( lane 2 ) or with ( lane 3 ) an excess ( 50 ng ) of unlabeled « B fragment , and the B2 probe ( lane 4 ) ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The lower basal levels of NF-xB* ( see text ) in lane 2 ( panel a ) compared with those in lane 5 could be due to lower specific activity of the xB probe in this experiment compared with that of the B2 probe .
It also reflects the fact that the affinity of NF- « B* for the B2 site is somewhat higher than that for the xB site ( see , for example , Fig .
3a ) .

Transfections .
Jurkat cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran protocol ( 13 ) .
Twenty hours after trans-fection , each culture was split into two , and one aliquot was treated with concanavalin A ( ConA ) plus phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) ( 50 pg/ml and 100 nM , respectively ) .
Twenty hours later , the cells were harvested and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity ( 12 ) .
Incubation was for 4 h at 37°C followed by a 3- to 16h exposure of the thin-layer chromatography plate to X-ray film .
RESULTS NF- « B-like protein binds B2 site of proenkephalin promoter .
The T-cell line Jurkat was activated by a combination of PMA and the lectin ConA .
Such treatments were reported ( 7 , 14 , 21 ) and were also shown here to activate NF- « B DNA-binding activity as reflected by binding to the « B sequence in the EMSA ( 9 , 10 ) ( Fig .
1a , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The level of expression of a constitutive transcription factor , NF-uE3 , was not affected by the ConA plus PMA treatments ( Fig .
la , lanes 9 and 10 ) .
The proenkephalin promoter contains two sites which are similar but not identical to the kB sequence ( 16 ) ( B1 and B2 , Fig .
2a ) .
We tested whether NF- « B can recognize these sites of the proenkephalin promoter .
An extract of the Jurkat T-cell line was reacted in an EMSA with the B1 or the B2 sequence of the rat proenkephalin promoter .
A ConA-PMA-inducible NF- « B-like activity was shown to bind specifically to the B2 site ( Fig .
la , lanes 3 to 5 ) but not to the B1 site ( data not shown ) .
An extract of the plasmacytoma $ 194 , which expresses high constitutive levels of NF-KB ( 2 ) , was also reacted with the B1 and B2 sequences and shown to bind only to the latter ( Fig .
1b ) .
The B2 site is important for proenkephalin transcription in activated T cells .
The observations that an NF- « B-like activity recognizes the B2 site at the proenkephalin promoter ( Fig .
1 ) and that similar activation treatments of helper T cells induce NF- « B DNA-binding activity ( Fig .
la ) and elevate the level of proenkephalin mRNA ( 33 ) raised the possibility that activation of NF- « B is the cause for the expression of proenkephalin in activated T cells .
To address this , we first constructed a plasmid containing the rat proenkephalin promoter in front of a reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cat gene [ see pEPCAT ( wt ) in Fig .
2a ] .
The plasmid was transfected into Jurkat cells , which were then treated with various concentrations of ConA plus PMA .
Such treatments not only induced NF- « B DNA-binding activity ( Fig .
la , lanes 1 to 5 ) but also produced significant transcriptional activations of the proenkephalin promoter ( Fig .
2b ) .
Next , to determine whether the observed transcriptional activation is due to the action of NF- « B , we mutated the B1 and B2 sites of the proenkephalin promoter .
These mutations ( marked mB1 and mB2 in Fig .
2a ) abolished binding of the NF- « B-like factor to the B2 site ( Fig .
la , compare lanes 3 to 5 with lanes 6 to 8 ) .
Because no NF- B-like binding was observed to the B1 site , mutating it did not affect the pattern of DNA binding ( data not shown ) .

Transcription activity of the proenkephalin promoter in Jurkat T cells .
( a ) Proenkephalin promoter-cat constructs used for transfections .
The proenkephalin promoter ( 27 ) is attached to the cat gene through a Sacl site [ pEPCAT ( wt ) ] .
The B1 and B2 binding sites within the promoter are indicated .
The mutations introduced into these sites are shown below the wild-type sequence ( mB1l and mB2 ; x denotes an A base in the B2 site that was deleted during mutagenesis ) .
Three combinations of the mutated sites were constructed : pEPCAT ( mB1 ) with a mutated B1 ( mB1 ) site and a wild-type B2 site , pEPCAT ( mB2 ) containing a wild-type B1 site and a mutated B2 ( mB2 ) site , and pEPCAT ( mB1B2 ) , in which both sites are mutated .
( b ) Proenkephalin promoter-mediated transcription in ConA-PMA-activated Jurkat T cells .
Jurkat cells were transfected with pEPCAT ( wt ) and 24 h later treated for 20 h or not treated ( lane 5 ) with PMA ( 100 nM ) ( lanes 1 to 3 ) and the indicated concentrations of ConA ( micrograms per milliliter ) ( lanes 2 to 4 ) .
( c ) Effects of mutating the B1 and B2 sites on proenkephalin promoter function in Jurkat T cells .
Jurkat cells were transfected with the various proenkephalin promoter-cat gene constructs indicated in panel a : pEPCAT ( wt ) ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , pEPCAT ( mB1B2 ) ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , pEPCAT ( mB1 ) ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , and pEPCAT ( mB2 ) ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Even-numbered cultures were activated with ConA plus PMA .
The basal activity of the ( unstimulated ) wild-type ( wt ) promoter appears lower in this experiment than in the one presented in panel b .
This is due to a shorter exposure of the thin-layer chromatography plate to film in this experiment compared with the one in panel b .
The mutated B1 and B2 sequences were then introduced into the proenkephalin promoter-cat constructs ( Fig .
2a ) and transfected into Jurkat cells .
The B1 mutation ( mB1 ) had no significant effect on the ability of a ConA plus PMA treatment to activate the proenkephalin promoter in these T cells ( Fig .
2¢ , compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5 and 6 ) .
This result is consistent with the inability of the NF- « B-like activity to bind to the B1 site ( Fig .
1b ) .
A construct containing the two mutated sites [ pEPCAT ( mB1B2 ) ] and one which consists of a combination of the B2 mutant with wild-type B1 [ pEPCAT ( mB2 ) ] exhibited reduced basal levels ( data not shown ) but most prominently an almost complete abolish-ment of the ConA-PMA-induced activity of the proenkephalin promoter ( Fig .
2¢c , compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4 and 7 and 8 ) .
It therefore appears that the native B2 site is essential for the inducibility of the proenkephalin promoter by the T-cell activators ConA and PMA .
Homodimeric form of NF-xB is the major binder to the B2 site .
The EMSA size of the NF- « B-like complex which bound the B2 site ( GGGGACGTCCCC ) of the proenkephalin promoter appeared smaller than the complex formed with the canonical « kB sequence ( GGGGACTTTCC ) .
This was true both for extracts from the ConA-PMA-induced Jurkat cells ( Fig .
la , compare lane 3 with lane 1 ) and for those prepared from the plasmacytoma $ 194 , expressing constitu-tively active NF- « B ( Fig .
1b , lanes 1 and 4 ) .
To determine whether these size differences are significant , we first ran higher-resolution EMSA gels .

Smaller form of NF- « B ( NF- « B* ) binds the proenkephalin B2 and IL-2 « B-like sites .
( a ) Binding of $ 194 extract to the canonical kB site and to the B2 site .
The same extract was reacted in an EMSA with the xB probe ( lanes 1 to 3 ) or the B2 probe ( lanes 4 to 6 ) in the presence of the indicated GTP concentrations .
In this experiment , a 6 % Tris-glycine gel was used .
( b ) Binding of $ 194 extract to the IL-2 kB-like site .
The extract was reacted in an EMSA with an end-labeled DNA fragment containing the IL-2 site ( sequence GGGATTTCACC ; kindly provided by M. Karin ) .
The binding was blocked either by the kB sequence ( 20 ng ; lane 2 ) or by the B2 sequence ( 20 ng of the Aval-HindIII fragment from the plasmid described in Materials and Methods ; lane 3 ) .
In this experiment , the native gel was 5 % in Tris-borate buffer .
shown ) and in the $ 194 ( Fig .
3a ) extracts , two DNA-protein complexes were observed to bind to the kB sequence .
Only the lower complex , marked NF- « B* , showed strong binding to the proenkephalin B2 sequence ( Fig .
3a , lanes 4 to 6 ) .
In agreement with the GTP-activatable nature of NF- « B ( 4 , 18 ) , both NF-kB and NF- « B* were activated by GTP treatment , although NF- « B* appeared to require higher GTP concentrations ( Fig .
3a ) .
The DNA-binding activity of NF-kB appears in two forms ( 4 ) .
The major and larger one is a heterotetramer consisting of two p65 and two p50 subunits ( 4 ) ; this form is sensitive to the action of the inhibitory subunit IB ( 4 , 31 ) .
The second form appears to be a dissociation product of the larger complex and is a smaller homodimeric form consisting of only two DNA-binding subunits ( two p50 subunits ) .
NF- « B* , which preferentially binds the B2 site , appeared to migrate in the EMSA to the same position as does the homodimeric form of NF- « B .
We therefore tested whether NF- « B* is actually the homodimer of the p50 subunit of NF- « B .
Purified preparations of NF- « B in either the heterotetrameric or the homodimeric form were reacted in the EMSA with the B2 sequence of the proenkephalin promoter .
Both forms of NF-kB recognized the B2 sequence ( Fig .
4 ) .
However , when normalized to the levels of binding obtained for each form with the canonical xB sequence ( Fig .
4 , lanes 1 and 5 ) , it appeared that the homodimer binds the B2 site at least five times better than does the heterotetramer ( Fig .
4 , compare the signal in lanes 1 to 3 with that in lanes 5 to 7 ) .
This result , obtained with purified proteins , correlates with the observation that in crude extracts ( Fig .
3a ) only NF- « B* exhibits high levels of binding to the B2 site .
DISCUSSION This study shows that the expression of proenkephalin in activated T cells ( 26 , 33 ) is , to a large extent , the result of transcriptional activation caused by interaction of the transcription factor NF-kB with the B2 site of the proenkephalin promoter .
The induction of NF- « B DNA-binding activity by ConA plus PMA paralleled the activation of the proenkephalin promoter ( Fig .
la , lanes 1 to 5 , and Fig .
2b ) .
Moreover , point mutations ( Fig .
2a ) that abolished the ability of NF- « B to recognize the B2 site ( Fig .
la , lanes 6 to 8 ) rendered the proenkephalin promoter unresponsive to the T-cell activators ConA and PMA ( Fig .
2¢ ) .
The B2 site of the proenkephalin promoter can therefore be considered an addi-tional , hitherto unrecognized ( 5 , 6 ) , regulatory element of this promoter .
Its present characterization resolves the transcriptional basis for the enigmatic appearance of high levels of enkephalin in activated T lymphocytes ( 26 , 33 ) .
The NF- « B-like activity ( marked also NF- « xB* ) that binds the B2 sequence appeared to migrate differently in the EMSA than did the complex that binds the canonical kB sequence ( Fig .
1 and 3a ) .

Binding of purified NF- « B to the proenkephalin B2 site .
NF- « B preparations which were purified as described previously ( 31 , 32 ) were reacted in EMSA with either the « B ( lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) - or the B2 ( lanes 3 , 4 , 7 , and 8 ) -containing DNA fragment in the presence of unlabeled « kB competitor ( lanes 2 and 6 ) or B2 competitor ( lanes 4 and 8 ) .
Competitors were as described in the legend to Fig .
3b .
In lanes 1 to 4 , the larger heterotetramer ( two p50 subunits plus two p65 subunits ) of NF- « B ( arrowhead ) was used ( the lower band is probably a proteolytic product of the factor [ 4 ] ) .
In lanes 5 to 8 , the smaller homodimeric ( two p50 subunits ) form of the factor was used .
plexes can be attributed to the fact that the major activity binding to the proenkephalin B2 site is the faster-migrating homodimeric form of NF- « B , whereas the kB sequence is bound better by the slower-migrating heterotetrameric form of NF- « B ( Fig .
4 ) .
That indeed NF- « B* is the homodimer of the p50 subunit of NF- « B is supported by the following : ( i ) its coinduction with NF- « B ( Fig .
la , lanes 1 to 5 ) ; ( ii ) the GTP-activatable nature of its DNA binding ( Fig .
3a ) , characteristic of both forms of NF-kB ( 4 , 17 ) ; and ( iii ) most importantly , a comparison of its properties with those of the purified p50 homodimer ( Fig .
4 ) -both proteins had similar electrophoretic mobilities in the EMSA , i.e .
, slightly faster than the heterotetramic form of the factor ( Fig .
3a and 4 ) , and both NF- « B* and the p50 homodimer had the same DNA-binding preferences .
The two proteins bound the B2 site of proenkephalin as well as , if not better than , the canonical kB sequence ( Fig .
3a and 4 ) .
This is in sharp contrast to the heterotetrameric form of NF- « B , which had at least fivefold higher affinity for the kB site ( Fig .
3a and 4 ) .
All cells that express significant levels of NF-KB also express the p50 homodimer of the factor ( 4 , 31 ) .
It is likely therefore that NF- « B* , the major NF- « xB-like DNA-binding activity to the B2 site of the proenkephalin promoter , is the p50 NF- « B ACTIVATES PROENKEPHALIN TRANSCRIPTION 1021 homodimer of NF-kB .
Notably , recent cDNA cloning experiments have shown the p50 homodimer to probably be identical to the transcription factor KBF1 ( 11 , 15 ) .
Thus , NF- « B* , KBF1 , and the p50 homodimer of NF- « B appear to be the same entity , but whether additional ( mainly posttrans-lational ) modifications differentiate among these three proteins remains to be seen .
The B2 site , through which NF- « B activates proenkephalin transcription in T lymphocytes , as well as the B1 site , which is not recognized by NF-KB , are also binding sites for BETA , a brain-specific transcription activator expressed only in brain cells ( 16 ) .
But , curiously , in primary cultures of cerebellar neurons that express BETA , the mutations at the B1 and B2 sites did not have a marked effect on proenkephalin promoter function ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that although NF- « B and BETA can both bind to the B2 site , they differ in their transcriptional activation capacity with regard to the proenkephalin promoter .
Furthermore , NF- « B in both its forms is present in many cell types other than T cells , for example , the plasmacytoma $ 194 ( Fig .
3 ) .
However , transfection of the proenkephalin promoter-cat construct into $ 194 cells that were either treated or not with ConA plus PMA did not result in transcriptional activation ( data not shown ) .
In addition , the mutation at the B2 site did not have any effect on the activity of the promoter in cells other than T lymphocytes .
It thus appears that the action of NF-kB in the context of the proenkephalin promoter is specific for activated T cells .
A similar situation exists for the promoter of the lymphokine IL-2 , which is activated through a « B-like regulatory sequence only in activated T cells ( 25 ) .
Notably , both in the proenkephalin ( this study ) and in the IL-2 promoter ( 14a ) , the major DNA-binding activity to the « B-like sites was the homodimeric form of NF- « B ( Fig .
3a and 4 ) .
Consistent with this was a competition experiment showing that the IL-2 < B-like sequence and the B2 site of proenkephalin are bound by the same protein ( Fig .
3b ) .
However , as both sequences were also recognized , albeit with lower affinity ( Fig .
4 ) , by the heterotetrameric form of NF- « B , it is difficult to determine which of the two forms of the factor is responsible for the T-cell-specific activation of these two promoters .
But the ubiquity of NF-kB , as opposed to the T-cell specificity of the « B-like site-mediated proenkephalin and IL-2 promoter function , argues that there might be yet another T-cell-specific factor which participates with ( or modulates ) NF-kB to activate these promoters .
One possibility is that the `` naked `` homodimeric form of NF- « B that binds tighter to the B2 site of the proenkephalin promoter is the target for such a T-cell-specific interaction .
