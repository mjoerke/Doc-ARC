CD14 , a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked antigen , functions as an LPS signaling receptor .
A critical issue concerns the mechanism by which CD14 , which has no transmembrane domain , transduces its signal following LPS bind-ing .
Recently , investigators have hypothesized that CD14-mediated signaling is effected through a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase ( TK ) , suggesting a multicom-ponent receptor model of LPS signaling .
Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) -K1 cells can be activated by endotoxin to release arachidonate following transfection with human CD14 ( CHO/CD14 ) .
Nuclear translocation of cytosolic NF-KB is correlated with a number of LPS-inducible responses .
We sought to determine if this pathway were present in CHO/CD14 cells and to elucidate the relationship of NF-B activation to the CD14 receptor system .
LPS-stimulated translocation of NF- « B in CHO/CD14 cells resembled the same response in the murine macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 .
Protein synthesis inhibitors and corticosteroids , which suppress arachidonate release and the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines , had no effect on translocation of NF- « B in CHO/CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells , demonstrating that NF-KB translocation is an early event .
Although TK activity was consistently observed by immunoblotting extracts from activated RAW 264.7 cells , LPS-induced phosphotyrosine residues were not observed from similarly treated CHO/CD14 cells .
Furthermore , the TK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein failed to inhibit translocation of NF- « B in CHO/CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells , although both of these agents inhibited LPS-induced TK activity in RAW 264.7 cells .
These results imply that TK activity is not obligatory for CDI14-mediated signal transduction to occur in response to LPS .

Gram-negative bacterial sepsis is believed to be initiated by interactions between lipopolysaccharide ( LPS , ' endotoxin ) , a bacterial membrane constituent , and specific receptors on mononuclear phagocytes , resulting in the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that are responsible for the hemodynamic instability and shock that are characteristic of the syndrome .
CD14 , the only molecule that has been shown definitively to be involved in LPS-initiated cellular activation , is a 53-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked antigen present on macrophages and neutrophils ( 1 ) .
Serum proteins ( 2-4 ) , such as LPS-binding protein ( LBP ) , act to facilitate binding of LPS to CD14 .
Both 53- and 48-kDa forms of CD14 are present as soluble LPS receptors in human serum and have been shown to enable LPS responsiveness in certain cell types in vitro ( 5-12 ) .
A central question in endotoxin research is the mechanism by which CD14 induces a signal following ligand binding in the absence of a transmembrane domain .
Kitchens et al .
( 11 ) demonstrated that LPS receptor antagonists , such as lipid IVa , could effectively block signaling by human monocytes in response to LPS when used at nanomolar concentrations .
Yet , when LPS binding to the cells was assessed under identical conditions , micromolar concentrations of antagonist were required to displace LPS from CD14 .
The observation that a significant quantity of LPS remained associated with membrane-bound CD14 , in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of antagonist , suggested that these agents function at a step distal to LPS binding to CD14 .
The authors hypothesized that a membrane-associated receptor distinct from CD14 is present in limiting quantities on the cell surface .
This putative receptor might function as a signal transducer following LPS binding to CD14 .
Alternatively , the role of CD14 may be to act as a transferase , delivering LPS to a downstream molecule which then effects the signal across the plasma membrane .
Several reports have described endotoxin-induced TK activity in mononuclear phagocytes ( 13-15 ) and CD14-transfected 702/3 pre-B cells ( 16 ) .
LPS stimulation resulted in prominent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in various proteins with molecular masses ranging from 38 to 48 kDa concomitant with dephosphorylation of several protein species ( 17 ) .
Furthermore , Stefanova et al .
( 18 ) demonstrated that the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases p56 % `` , p58 `` * , and p59 % * `` were transiently activated in human monocytes following exposure of the cells to 'The abbreviations used are : LPS , lipopolysaccharide ; LBP , lipo-polysaccharide-binding protein ; TK , tyrosine kinase ; [ °HJ20:4 , [ 5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-HJarachidonic acid ; CHO-K1 , Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast-K1 ; NF-kB , nuclear factor- « B ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; rsCD14 , recombinant soluble CD14 ; PBS , phos-phate-buffered saline ; mAb , monoclonal antibody ; CNTF , ciliary neurotrophic factor ; gp , glycoprotein .

Pharmacologic studies with TK inhibitors supported the concept that TK activity is essential for the earliest LPS-inducible events .
For example , treatment of LPS-responsive cells with the TK antagonist herbimycin A blocked induction of phosphotyrosine residues in cellular lysates ( 16 ) and inhibited induction of p564 `` , p58 `` * , and p59 % * `` activity ( 18 ) .
Herbimycin A also blocked physiologic responses of mononuclear phagocytes following exposure to LPS , including the release of [ *HJarachidonic acid ( [ °H ] 20:4 ( 13 ) ) and the production of cytokines ( 18 ) .
Collectively , the observations outlined above suggested that TK activity is essential , at least in part , for LPS-induced signal transduction .
One model of signaling proposes that CD14 comprises a portion of an LPS-specific signaling complex which includes a transmembrane signal transducer with TK activity .
Wild-type hamster CHO-K1 cells are not responsive to LPS .
The construction of a CHO cell line , CHO/CD14 , which expresses membrane-bound human CD14 , has been reported previously ( 9 ) .
Stimulation of CHO/CD14 cells with as little as 1 ng of LPS/ml resulted in the release of [ °H ] J20:4 into the culture supernatant , whereas wild-type CHO-K1 or a mock-transfected CHO cell line ( designated CHO/NEO ) failed to release [ °H ] 20:4 at concentrations as high as 100 ug of LPS/ml .
This CD14-mediated response closely resembled [ °H ] J20:4 release from the murine macrophage-like cell line , RAW 264.7 , which expresses CD14 .
Another macrophage response to LPS-stimulation is the translocation of the transcription factor NF- « B into the nucleus ( 19 ) .
NF- « B activation appears to be a sentinel event in LPS-stimulated macrophages , heralding the activation of proinflammatory cytokines ( 20-22 ) as well as the production of human immunodeficiency virus , type 1 virions in latently infected mononuclear phagocytes ( 19 ) .
We used the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) to examine LPS-induced NF- « B activation in CHO/CD14 cells in response to LPS , to determine if this response resembles LPS-induced NF- « B activation in murine macrophages .
Expression of CD14 in CHO-K1 cells imparted LPS-inducible NF-kB translocation .
Both wild-type CHO-K1 or CHO/NEO cells failed to respond to LPS , confirming our previous observation that we were able to isolate a CD14-specific pathway of LPS activation in transfected CHO cells .
Recombinant soluble CD14 ( rsCD14 ) , when added simultaneously with LPS to wild-type CHO cells , failed to enable responses to LPS .
Surprisingly , LPS-inducible TK activity was not apparent in CHO/CD14 cells following exposure to LPS , and pharmacologic inhibitors of TK failed to prevent LPS-induced activation of NF- « B in either CHO/CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells .
When taken together , these data suggest that TK activity is not required for CD14-dependent LPS-induced NF- « B translocation .

Fifty ng of this material was end labeled using Klenow fragment ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) in the presence of 100 uCi each of [ a-P ] JdATP and ( 3,000 Ci/mmol , DuPont NEN ) and unlabeled dGTP and dTTP at 100 um in a final volume of 50 ul as described in ( 25 ) .
Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a G-25 ( Pharmacia ) spin column .
Two-tenths ng of DNA probe ( 20,000 cpm ) was used in a DNA binding reaction containing 4 pg of crude nuclear extract .
The DNA binding reaction also contained 50 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) /ml , 5 % glycerol , and 1 x band shift buffer ( 10 mm Tris-HCl , pH 7.8 , 1 mm EDTA , 40 mm KCl , and 1 mm dithiothreitol ) .
Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and size fractionated by electrophoresis in 4 % native polyacrylamide ( Protogel brand acrylamide : bisacrylamide ( v/v , 30:0.8 ) , National Diagnostics , At-lanta , GA ) gels containing 0.25 x TBE ( 1 x TBE : 89 mn Tris borate , 89 mm boric acid , and 2 mm EDTA ) which had been preelectrophoresed for 30 min at 100 volts .
Gels were run at 10 volts/ecm for 45 min at room temperature .

Sequznor 2 Anti-phosphotyrosine Immunoblotting-Following stimulation of the cells ( 1-2 x 10° ) , culture medium was aspirated , and 60 ul of lysis buffer ( 100 mm Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 ( 22°C ) , 137 mm NaCl , 2 mm EDTA , 1 % glycerol ( v/v ) , 1 % Triton X-100 , 1 m sodium vanadate , 50 mm sodium fluoride , 100 um quercitin , 100 um 1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloro-methyl ketone , 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 20 um leupeptin , 0.14 unit/ml aprotinin ) was added to each well .
The plates were then incubated for 30 min on ice .
Cell lysates were collected and cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min in a microcentrifuge ( 13,500 x g ) , and protein concentrations were determined .
Equal amounts of protein ( 10 ug ) were mixed with 4 x Laemmli sample buffer ( 62 mm Tris-HCl , pH 6.8 , 2 % glycerol , 5 % SDS , 0.05 % B-mercaptoethanol , and 0.05 % brom-phenol blue ) , boiled for 5 min , and frozen at -80 °C until analysis by immunoblotting .
Samples were electrophoresed on a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
Following electrophoresis , proteins were blotted onto Im-mobilon-P membranes ( Millipore Corp. , Bedford , MA ) and then probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb using a horseradish peroxidase-based chemiluminescence system as described in ( 17 ) .
Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay-For immunoprecipitation assays , CHO/CD14 and CHO/NEO cells were grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes to approximately 80 % confluence ( 10 ' cells ) in Ham 's F-12 medium containing L-glutamine supplemented with 10 % ( v/v ) fetal bovine serum , penicillin G ( 100 units/ml ) , and streptomycin ( 100 mg/ml ) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO , .
The growth medium was aspirated and replaced with 5 ml of fresh medium containing 1 ug/ml LPS when required .
After the stimulation period , the medium was aspirated , the cells were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 ma sodium vanadate ( PBSPV ) , and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer ( 10 mai Tris-HCl , pH 8.2 , 140 mm NaCl , 2 mm EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mi phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 15 milliunits/ml aprotinin , 20 mam leupeptin , 1 mm sodium vanadate , and 0.1 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone ) .
THP-1 cells ( ATCC TIB 202 ) were seeded at a concentration of 2 x 10° cells/100-mm dish in 10 ml of growth medium ( RPMI 1640 containing 10 % ( v/v ) fetal bovine serum , penicillin G ( 100 units/ml ) , streptomycin ( 100 mg/ml ) , and 0.1 um 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , ( Biomol Research Laboratories , Plymouth Meeting , PA ) ) .
After 72 h , fresh growth medium ( 5 ml ) was added , and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. For LPS stimulation , an additional 5 ml of growth medium containing LPS at a final concentration of 1 ug/ml was added .
Next , the cells were gently removed from the plates using a cell scraper , washed with PBSPV , and lysed in lysis buffer .
The lysates were then subjected to solid phase immunoprecipitation and kinase assays as described ( 18 , 26 ) with minor modifications .
Briefly , 96-well U-bottom Microtest III plates ( Falcon Labware , Oxnard , CA ) were coated with 100 ul of goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG ( Sigma ) ( 0.1 mg/ml ) at 37°C for 2 h. The plates were then washed three times with 200 ul of PBS .
Next , 100 ul of mouse mAb against CD14 , MY4 ( 20 ug/ml ) , or rabbit polyclonal antibody against lyn ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ; 10 ug/ml ) was added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C .
The wells were washed three times with PBS , and blocked with 0.2 % gelatin , 1 % gly-cine in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C .
The blocking solution was removed , and 100-ul aliquots of the lysates ( 1 mg/ml ) were added to the wells .
After a 4-h incubation at 4°C , the lysates were aspirated , the wells were washed three times with lysis buffer , and 50 ul of kinase assay buffer ( 25 mm Hepes , pH 7.2 , 3 mm MnCl , , 20 my MgCl , , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , and 5 uCi of [ y-*P ] JATP ( 3,000 Ci/mm ; Amersham Corp. ) ) was added to the wells .
After 5 min at room temperature , the proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography .
RESULTS LPS Induces NF- « B Translocation in CHO/CD14 Cells-Previous studies have shown that wild-type CHO-K1 cells do not release [ °H ] 20:4 in response to treatment with LPS ( 9 ) .
We have also reported previously the construction of a CHO cell line , CHO/CD14 , which expresses moderate levels of surface human CD14 ( 9 ) .
Stimulation of CHO/CD14 cells with as little as 1 ng of LPS/ml resulted in the release of [ °H ] 20:4 into the culture supernatant .

LPS-induced NF- « B translocation in CD14-transfected CHO cells .
CHO/CD14 ( panel a ) and CHO/NEO ( panel b ) monolayers containing 2-3 x 10° cells were stimulated , in 0.8 ml of Ham 's F-12 containing 2 % heat-inactivated human serum , with 1 ug of LPS/ml for the times ( in min ) indicated in the figure .
Nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA combined with autoradiography as described under `` Materials and Methods `` using *°P-labeled probe DNA containing the immunoglobulin x gene enhancer consensus sequence .
Panel c , competition analysis was performed by including a 25-fold molar excess of unlabeled specific ( SP ) or nonspecific ( NS ) oligonucleotide in the DNA binding reactions assembled with nuclear extracts from CHO/CD14 cells treated with LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) for 1 h. sembled [ *H ] 20:4 release from the murine macrophage-like cell line , RAW 264.7 , in response to LPS stimulation .
An additional macrophage response to LPS is the translocation of the transcription factor , NF-kB ( 19 ) .
We therefore chose the EMSA to study LPS-induced NF- « B activation in CHO/CD14 cells in response to LPS to determine whether this response is similar to LPS-induced NF- « B activation in macrophages .
CHO/CD14 and CHO/NEO cells were treated with LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) for increasing periods of time .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described under `` Materials and Methods `` and were subjected to EMSA using a DNA probe containing the NF- « B-binding element from the murine immunoglobulin k light chain gene enhancer .
Nuclear localization of NF-kB was evident in CHO/CD14 cells within 15 min and maximal within 30 min following exposure to LPS ( Fig .
1a ) .
Peak activation of the CHO/CD14 cells resulted in a 10-fold increase in nuclear NF- « B levels as determined by scanning densitometry .
Nuclear levels of NF-kB returned to basal levels within 2 h following exposure to LPS .
In contrast , treatment of CHO/NEO cells with LPS did not result in NF- « B activation ( Fig .
16 ) .
Thus , CHO cells can acquire responsiveness to LPS as a result of CD14 expression .
These data extend our earlier findings that CHO/ CD14 cells release arachidonic acid metabolites in response to LPS , by demonstrating that NF-kB translocation is also induced by LPS in these cells .
Competition analysis was performed on nuclear extracts prepared from CHO/CD14 cells stimulated for 1 h with 1 ug of LPS/ml to demonstrate specificity of the retarded complexes observed in the EMSA .
Inclusion of a 25-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded NF-kB oligonucleotide in the DNA binding reaction containing nuclear extracts from stimulated CHO/CD14 cells effectively blocked LPS-induced formation of DNA/protein complexes ( Fig .

LPS dose response in CHO/CD14 cells .
Monolayers of CHO/CD14 and RAW cells ( 2 x 10¢/well of a six-well dish ) were treated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of LPS ( 0-100 ng/ml ) suspended in Ham 's F-12 medium containing 2 % human serum .
The stimulation was stopped by placing the tissue culture dishes on ice .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to EMSA and autoradiography as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
excess of a nonspecific double-stranded DNA probe in the DNA binding reaction did not result in competition for protein binding to the radiolabeled DNA probe .
These results indicate that the observed DNA-protein complex arises through sequence-specific interactions with the NF-kB consensus sequence .
Furthermore , inclusion of anti-human mAbs , specific for NF- « B-related proteins in the DNA binding reactions , demonstrated that NF- « B p65 is a component of the DNA-protein complex observed in CHO/CD14 cells following stimulation with endotoxin ( data not shown ) .
LPS Induces NF-kB Translocation in CHO/CD14 Cells in a Manner Similar to the Murine Macrophage-like Cell Line , RAW 264.7-LPS dose-response experiments were performed to compare NF-kB translocation in CHO/CD14 cells versus RAW 264.7 cells .
Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of LPS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to EMSA .
As little as 0.1 ng of LPS/ml was sufficient to activate NF-kB translocation in CHO/CD14 cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Similar results were observed with LPS dose-response experiments performed on RAW 264.7 cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Response was maximal in both cell lines between 10 and 100 ng of LPS/ ml .
These results were consistent with CD14-mediated signaling in both cell lines through similar signal transduction pathways resulting in NF-kB activation .
mAbs to CD14 Inhibit NF- « B Activation in CHO/CD14 Cells-Many macrophage responses to LPS , including [ *H ] 20:4 release , increased TK activity , and cytokine release , can be inhibited by treating cells with the anti-CD14 mAb MY4 ( 27 ) .
CHO/CD14 cells were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of 200 ug of MY4 mAb/ml .
After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h , nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by EMSA .
Treatment of CHO/CD14 cells with 10 ng of LPS/ml resulted in NF-kB activation .
This response was blocked by adding MY4 mAb and LPS simultaneously ( Fig .
3 ) .
Control experiments using control IgG , , antibodies did not result in loss of NF-kB activation ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that LPS-induced NF- « B activation in CHO/CD14 cells is initiated through LPS binding to transfected human CD14 .
Soluble CD14 Fails to Enable Responses to LPS in CHO-K1 Cells-Several recent reports have demonstrated that soluble CD14 can confer LPS sensitivity to endothelial cells and other cell lines that do not express detectable levels of CD14 ( 8 , 28-32 ) , even in the absence of LBP .
We have reported previously that serum , which contains both LBP and soluble CD14 , failed to enable LPS-induced [ °H ] 20:4 release in CHO cells that have not been transfected with CD14 ( 9 ) .
As demonstrated above , serum also failed to substitute for membrane-bound LPS Activation of NF-kB Is Tyrosine Kinase-independent [ my4 - _+ _- _+ ] [ - __+ scpi4 ] [ ups 0 0 10 10 _ 10 10 | | N » uP TP Fic .

Effects of anti-CD14 mAb in CHO/CD14 cells and effect of rsCD14 in CHO-K1 cells .
CHO/CD14 cells were treated for 1 h with 10 ng of LPS/ml in the absence ( - ) or presence ( + ) of 200 ug MY4 ( anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody ) /ml in Ham 's F-12 medium containing 2 % heat-inactivated human serum ; the LPS and the monoclonal antibody were premixed and added simultaneously .
As part of the same experiment , monolayers of wild-type CHO-K1 cells were washed free of serum three times with 1 ml of Ham 's F-12 and were stimulated with 100 ng of LPS/ml for 1 h in the absence or presence of rsCD14 ( 10 ug/ml ) in macrophage serum-free medium ( which contains 0.5 % albumin ) .
Nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA and autoradiography as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
CD14 when LPS-induced translocation of NF-kB was exam-ined .
We examined this issue in greater depth using rsCD14 .
The bioactivity of rsCD14 was confirmed by its ability to enable LPS induction of tissue factor production in endothelial cells . ``
Wild-type CHO-K1 cells were treated with 10 ng of LPS/ml , under serum-free conditions , in the absence or presence of 10 ug of rsCD14/ml .
Nuclear extracts were prepared after 1 h of stimulation and analyzed by EMSA .
CHO-K1 cells were not responsive to LPS in either the absence or the presence of rsCD14 ( Fig .
3 ) .
These results suggest that under serum-free conditions , membrane-bound CD14 is required for LPS-induced NF- « B activation in CHO cells .
NF-kB Activation in CHO/CD14 and RAW 264.7 cells Is an Early Event in LPS Signal Transduction and Does Not Require Concomitant mRNA or Protein Synthesis-CHO/CD14 and RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with either 1.0 um actinomycin D or cycloheximide for 30 min prior to stimulation with LPS ( 10 ng/ml ) .
As expected , these conditions inhibited the release of [ °H ] 20:4 metabolites following stimulation of CHO/CD14 cells with endotoxin ( data not shown ) .
EMSA of nuclear extracts prepared from these cells demonstrated that , unlike arachidonate release , CD14-dependent LPS-induced NF- « B activation did not require ongoing transcription or translation ( Fig .
4 ) .
Treatment of macrophages with anti-inflammatory glucocor-ticoid hormones can effectively block many of their responses to LPS including the release of cytokines .
CHO/CD14 and RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with dexamethasone for 30 min followed by the addition of LPS to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml .
Nuclear localization of NF- « B in response to LPS stimulation was quantitated by EMSA of nuclear extracts ( Fig .

NF- « B activation in both cell lines was not effected by pretreatment of cells with dexamethasone .
TK Activity Is Not Apparent in CHO Cells Stimulated with LPS-Recently , several reports have presented data suggesting that TK activity is involved in CD14-dependent LPS-induced signaling in LPS-responsive monocytes or macrophages ( 13-15 , 18 ) and a CD14-transfected 70 % /3 pre-B lymphocytic cell line ( 16 ) .
We sought to determine if endotoxin activated a CD14-associated TK in CHO/CD14 cells .
CHO/ CD14 , CHO/NEO , and RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 100 2 D. T. Golenbock , H. Lichenstein , R. Bach , and C. F. Moldow , manuscript in preparation .

Inhibitors of transcription and translation did not block LPS activation of NF- « B .
CHO/CD14 or RAW cells were pretreated for 1 h with a 1 um concentration of either actinomycin D ( ACT ) , cycloheximide ( CHX ) , or dexamethasone ( DEX ) .
This treatment was shown to inhibit LPS-induced release of arachidonate from both CHO/ CD14 and RAW 264.7 cells ( data not shown ) .
Subsequently , either 800 ul of Ham 's F-12 supplemented with 2 % heat-inactivated human serum ( M ) or an equal volume of LPS suspended in complete medium at 10 ng/ml ( L ) was added .
After 60 min of stimulation , nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA and autoradiography as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
CHO/CDI4 RAW ng/ml LPS for 1 h , lysed with Triton X-100 , and analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 ( Fig .
5a ) .
As expected , CHO/NEO did not demonstrate TK activity in response to LPS treatment .
CHO/CD14 cells also failed to demonstrate LPS-inducible TK activity .
However , treatment of CHO/CD14 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in the induction of phosphotyrosine residues in a low molecular mass protein ( ~40 kDa ) , demonstrating that the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb recognized phosphotyrosine residues from CHO cells .
Even using short periods of treatment ( 30 s ) we failed to observe inducible tyrosine phosphorylation in the CHO/CD14 cells stimulated by LPS .
In contrast to CHO/ CD14 cells , we reproducibly observed in RAW 264.7 cells the presence of three proteins ( ~40-47 kDa ) that contain induced tyrosine phosphorylation upon LPS stimulation .
An alternative method of examining LPS-stimulated CHO/ CD14 transfectants for inducible TK activity is the solid phase immunoprecipitation and kinase assay ( 18 , 26 ) .
This technique has been employed recently by Stefanova and colleagues to describe CD14-associated tyrosine kinases in LPS-stimulated human monocytes ( 18 ) .
These authors reported that LPS activated the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases p56 `` , p58* `` * , and p59 `` .
Furthermore , p56 `` `` was apparently associated with CD14 : immunoprecipitation of stimulated monocytes with anti-CD14 mAb resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of activated p56 `` `` .
When CHO/NEO and CHO/CD14 cells were stimulated with LPS for 15 min and subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CD14 mAb , no CD14-associated LPS-inducible phosphotyrosine residues were observed ( Fig .
5b , first four lanes , from left ) .
Similar results were obtained with the CHO transfectants at 5 , 30 , and 60 min of LPS stimulation ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , when vitamin D , -differentiated THP-1 cells ( a human monocytic cell line ) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CD14 mAb ( MY4 ) , CD14-associated kinase activity was observed at 75-80 , 53/56 , 30 , and 25 kDa ( Fig .
5b , fifth and sixth lanes ) .
When isotype-matched control antibodies were used , no kinase activity was observed from any of the cell lines ( data not shown ) .
Simultaneous immuno-precipitations with anti-lyn antibodies ( « -lyn ) presumptively identified the 53/56-kDa residues as p56 `` ( Fig .
5b , seventh and eighth lanes ) , consistent with the observations of Stefanova et al .
( 18 ) .
Thus , although we confirmed that LPS-inducible activation of a CD14-associated TK occurred in monocytes , this activity was not necessary for NF- « B translocation .
LPS stimulation of CD14-transfected CHO cells was not associated with activation of any CD14-associated TK under conditions that result in NF-kB translocation .
To assess further the requirement for TK activity in LPS-induced CD14-dependent signaling , we assayed TK and NF-kB 22257 a LPS | - 1 § 0150 -| - 15 - | - 15 PMA | - - > - > - 15 ] - > - 15 | - -15 |M 106 ( kD ) 80 W| 49 be 32.5 27.5 CHO/CD14 CHO/NEO _ RAW b MY4 lyn 7r— `` CHO/neo CHO/CD14 Lo e E- + -o 4 `` ~ 4 o- ' ReLPS ( iug/ml ) + 140 kDa + 87 kDa m - 48 kDa ® # - 33 kDa vag ( * - 29 kDa ( antics ANBHA 80m : Fic .

Immunoblots were performed with cellular extracts prepared from RAW 264.7 cells pretreated with TK antagonists prior to stimulation with LPS , to assess the ability of these agents to block tyrosine phosphorylation .
Both herbimycin A and genistein were effective at inhibiting LPS-inducible TK activity in RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells as demonstrated by the absence of inducible phosphotyrosine residues in cellular proteins following stimulation with LPS , demonstrating the effectiveness of the TK antagonists ( data not shown ) .
Herbimycin A and genistein had little effect on the ability of LPS to induce NF-kB translocation in either CHO/ CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells ( Fig .

Effect of TK inhibitors on LPS activation of NF-KB .
Cells were pretreated with the TK antagonists , herbimycin A ( Her , 5 ug/ml ) or genistein ( Gen , 100 um ) for 4 h and then incubated for an additional hour either in the absence ( - ) or presence ( + ) of 10 ng of LPS/ml in Ham 's F-12 supplemented with 2 % human serum .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by EMSA as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
Scanning densitometry of the autoradiographs showed that the ratio of nuclear NF-kB in stimulated/unstimulated cells was CHO/CD14 : 3.6 , 13 , and 4.8 ; RAW : 8.1 , 10.9 , and 2.2 ( no inhibitor , plus herbimycin A , and plus genistein , respectively ) .
peared to proceed in the absence of TK activity in both CHO/ CD14 and RAW 264.7 cells .
Effect of Erbstatin Analog , a TK Antagonist , on Basal NF-kB Levels-Pretreatment of either CHO/CD14 or RAW 264.7 cells with erbstatin analog resulted in a time-dependent decrease in NF- « B DNA binding activity present in nuclear extracts prepared from resting and LPS-stimulated cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
The observation that basal levels of NF-kB also were diminished in cells treated with erbstatin analog suggested that the drug might cause a decrease in the cellular pools of NF-kB .
Thus , its ability to block LPS-induced activation of NF-kB was unrelated to transmembrane signaling .
Alternatively , erbstatin analog might actually inhibit the LPS signal transduction machinery required for activation of cellular NF-kB .
To distinguish between these two possibilities , we prepared cytosolic extracts from either untreated RAW 264.7 cells or cells that had been treated with erbstatin analog for 1 h. Cytoplasmic extracts were treated sequentially with deoxycholate and Nonidet P-40 and then analyzed by EMSA .
Treating cytoplasmic extracts with deoxycholate followed by Nonidet P-40 effectively dissociates heterodimeric complexes of NF-kB from their inhibitory subunits ( e.g .
IxB ) , allowing NF-kB to bind specifically to DNA probes in vitro ( 33 , 34 ) .
Deoxycholate/Nonidet P-40 treatment of cytosolic extracts from cells that had not been treated with erbstatin analog revealed the presence of significant quantities of NF-kB DNA binding activity ( Fig .
7 ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts prepared from RAW 264.7 cells treated with erbstatin analog for 1 h contained dramatically reduced levels of NF-kB as evidenced by the deoxycholate/Nonidet P-40 treatment ( Fig .
7 , lanes 9 and 10 ) .
Similar results were also observed using CHO/CD14 cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the apparent ability of erbstatin analog to inhibit LPS-induced activation of NF-kB was not the result of inhibition of LPS-induced signal transduction .
Rather , pretreatment of cells with erbstatin analog caused the elimination of functional NF-kB from cellular pools .
DISCUSSION The discovery that LBP-complexed LPS can activate cells by interacting directly with CD14 was a fundamental breakthrough in understanding the mechanism by which endotoxin activates monocytes , macrophages , and neutrophils .
The results of CD14 transfection experiments ( 9 , 12 , 16 , 35 ) imply that proteins required for LPS signal transduction , subsequent to ligand binding by CD14 , are widespread and not limited to LPS Activation of NF-kB Is Tyrosine Kinase-independent LPS | -|- | - | - [ + [ +/+ /+ Erb an| 0 | 1 | 2 0 |1 ] |2 ] 3 | 0 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 % 10 Lane 1 Fic .

Erbstatin analog eliminated NF- « B cytosolic pools from RAW 264.7 cells .
Cell monolayers were treated with 100 um erbstatin analog in complete medium for increasing periods of time and incubated an additional hour in the absence ( - ) or presence ( + ) of 10 ng of LPS/ml .
The time with which cells were treated with erbstatin analog prior to LPS stimulation is indicated in hours above the corresponding lane .
Nuclear extracts ( lanes 1-8 ) were prepared as described under `` Materials and Methods , `` except that the cells were lysed in 100 ul of buffer I prior to analysis by EMSA .
Cytoplasmic fractions from unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells ( lanes 9 and 10 ) were reserved from the same cells used to prepare the nuclear extracts shown in lanes 1 and 2 , respectively , and dialyzed against 10,000 volumes of buffer II ( see `` Materials and Meth-ods `` ) for 12 h. The extracts were adjusted to 0.1 % deoxycholate ( v/v ) , incubated on ice for 10 min , then supplemented with Nonidet P-40 to 0.1 % ( v/v ) , and incubated an additional 15 min on ice before subjecting to EMSA .
Lanes containing nuclear extracts ( lanes 1-8 ) were exposed to film overnight with an intensifying screen at -80 °C ; lanes containing cytoplasmic extracts ( Zanes 9 and 10 ) were exposed to film for 5 days with an intensifying screen at -80 °C .
Virtually identical results were seen when cells were pretreated 10 um erbstatin analog ( data not shown ) .
myeloid cells .
The transcription factor NF- « B has been shown to be rapidly translocated in macrophages following stimulation with endotoxin .
Here , we demonstrate that treatment of CHO/CD14 cells with low concentrations of LPS induced rapid nuclear translocation of NF-kB .
This response is an early signaling event and does not appear to require transcription or de novo protein synthesis .
Furthermore , TK activity apparently was not required to observe NF-kB translocation in transfected cells as evidenced by immunoblotting lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies ( Fig .
5 ) or pharmacologic analysis of both CHO/CD14 and RAW 264.7 cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
Surprisingly , LPS in conjunction with soluble CD14 did not induce NF-kB activation in wild-type CHO-K1 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Ciliary neurotrophic factor ( CNTF ) -induced signal transduction may provide the best model for the study of cell signaling by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins .
In this signaling system , CNTF binds the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-an-chored « component ( CNTFR- « ) of the CNTF receptor causing CNTFR- « to bind sequentially to the B component of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and gp130 .
Similarly , binding of interleukin-6 to its soluble receptor is followed by the association of this complex to a dimer of gp130 and results in signal transduction .
Another variant of this signaling paradigm is signal transduction in response to leukemia inhibitory factor , which binds to leukemia inhibitory factor receptor-B , an integral protein on responsive cells , inducing heterodimerization with gp130 , tyrosine phosphorylation of the two subunits , and signal transduction ( 36 ) .
In each signal transduction system described above , tyrosine phosphorylation of the transmembrane subunits occurs concomitantly with dimerization or tri-merization of the receptor complexes .
Signal transduction across the membrane is observed as evidenced by the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of low molecular mass cellular proteins ( 36 ) .
Therefore , specificity of the gp130 signal-transducing molecule is conferred by accessory proteins , which do not necessarily signal directly , but are required for proper receptor function .
LPS Activation of NF- « B Is Tyrosine Kinase-independent Recently , reports have suggested that like the CNTF recep-tor , CD14 does not signal directly , but signals through an as yet unidentified signal transducing protein .
We have even considered that gp130 is the CD14-associated signal transducer , but experiments in our laboratory with human mononuclear cells purified from whole blood have failed to demonstrate that anti-gp130 mAb ( gift from Drs .
T. Taga and T. Kishimoto , Japan ) inhibit LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-a release . ``
In light of the CNTF model , the rapid appearance of TK activity observed following exposure to endotoxin in RAW 264.7 cells ( 13 , 14 ) , human monocytes ( 15 , 18 ) , and CD14-transfected 702/3 lym-phocytes ( 16 ) suggested that this putative signal transducing protein may function by activating a TK cascade .
We were unable to demonstrate LPS-inducible TK activity by immunoblotting protein extracts from LPS-treated CHO/CD14 cells whereas , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced a distinct pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
5a ) .
This suggested that a TK event was not required for LPS-induced activation of NF- « B in CHO/CD14 cells .
We have considered the possibility that the immunoblot assay lacked the sensitivity required to detect LPS-induced TK activation in CHO/CD14 cells and that the putative CD14-related signal-transducing element nevertheless might be a TK .
However , our observations that pretreatment of CHO/CD14 cells or murine macrophages with genistein and herbimycin A did not inhibit LPS-induced activation of NF- « B ( Fig .
6 ) coupled with the immunoblot data further suggest that this signal transduction pathway does not require TK activity for NF- « B activation in CHO/CD14 and RAW 264.7 cells .
Although it might appear that the TK inhibitors had some inhibitory effect on nuclear NF- « B levels in LPS-stimulated cells , basal levels of nuclear NF- « B present in CHO/CD14 and RAW 264.7 cells pretreated with either herbimycin A or genistein were decreased relative to untreated control cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
Our experimental results , as well as those presented by others ( e.g .
see Fig .
6b in Ref .
16 ) may reflect the ability of some TK inhibitors to decrease overall levels of NF-kB through their effects on NF- « B synthesis or stability .
The apparent inhibitory effects of TK inhibitors on nuclear NF- « B levels do not appear to reflect a requirement for TK activity for signal transduction to occur .
We present data here that CHO/CD14 cells do not respond to LPS stimulation by activating TK using three established ap-proaches .
First , inducible phosphotyrosine residues are not observed by Western blot .
Second , in vitro kinase assays fail to show receptor-associated TK activity .
Finally , TK inhibitors fail to block an LPS-inducible response .
Thus , the CNTF receptor paradigm may not apply directly to CD14-mediated signaling .
However , it is likely that signaling pathways other than those that culminate in NF- « B translocation , such as those that result in the production of certain inflammatory mediators , may indeed require TK activity .
Macrophages possess a large repertoire of LPS-inducible responses , and these pathways may require the activity of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases activated in cells following engagement of CD14 with LPS .
The absence of TK activity in CHO/CD14 could explain the small number of macrophage-like responses acquired by CHO-K1 cells following transfection with CD14 .
Because many of the genes for select tyrosine kinases have been cloned and can be transfected in CHO cells , this hypothesis can now be tested .
Several recent publications have demonstrated that soluble CD14 can bind LPS and activate endothelial and epithelial cells in the absence of LBP ( 8 , 28-32 ) .
It was proposed that rsCD14-LPS complexes can interact with specific receptors on the surface of these cell types and effect signal transduction .
A soluble form of the CNTF receptor a component was shown to * R. I. Ingalls and D. T. Golenbock , unpublished data .
22259 activate normally nonresponsive cells in the presence of CNTF ( 37 ) .
Thus , it was surprising that rsCD14 did not compensate for membrane bound CD14 in CHO-K1 cells .
This result was probably not due to the absence of a glycosylphosphatidylinosi-tol anchor because an integral membrane form of CD14 functions in a manner identical with the glycolipid-anchored form of CD14 when transfected into 702/3 cells ( 35 ) .
Membrane attachment of CD14 therefore might be a unique requirement for activation of the CHO-K1 signal transduction pathway .
Alternatively , expression of high levels of CD14 in transfectants would result in a sufficient density of CD14 molecules on the plasma membrane compared with LPS-activated rsCD14 , which might be necessary for interacting with additional signaling molecules in CHO-K1 cells .
Finally , the association of LPS with rsCD14 is time-dependent and can be facilitated cat-alytically by LBP ( 38 ) .
In the experiments presented here , rsCD14 and LPS were added to CHO-K1 cells in the absence of LBP without preincubation , and thus rsCD14 and LPS may not have had time to form active complexes .
We have not rigorously assessed this kinetic issue and can not rule out the possibility that rsCD14 might enable LPS responses in CHO-K1 cells under different stimulation conditions .
Further examination of the mechanism of soluble CD14 is beyond the scope of this paper .
The observation that CHO/CD14 cells respond to LPS by nuclear translocation of NF- « B and metabolism of arachidonic acid is strong evidence that signaling molecules similar to those in phagocytes are present in CHO/CD14 cells .
The fact that CHO cells are easily manipulated and efficiently transfected makes the CHO/CD14 cell line a valuable tool in which to employ molecular genetic analysis of the LPS signaling pathway culminating in activation of NF- « B and arachidonic acid metabolism .
Ultimately , a combination of genetic analysis and pharmacologic approaches should identify the family of LPS signaling proteins which can subsequently be targeted for the development of therapeutic agents for sepsis .
