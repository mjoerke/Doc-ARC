Rosalynde J. Finch , * Patrick E. Fields , `` and Philip D. Greenberg**** Both CD4* and CD8 * T cells that produce IL-2 in response to Ag recognition have been isolated .
However , most effector CD8 * T cells recovered after exposure to Ag do not produce sufficient IL-2 to sustain growth , and depend on CD4* T helper cells for this obligate growth factor .
IL-2 expression in CD4* T cells is primarily controlled at the level of transcription , but mechanisms restricting IL-2 production in CD8* T cells have not been elucidated .
To evaluate transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 gene in CD8 * T cells , we stably transfected reporter genes into Ag-specific CD8 * T cell clones .
CD28* CD8 * T cells unable to transcribe the IL-2 gene in response to antigenic stimulation had a block in transactivation of the -150 CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) / AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter , but did transactivate the composite NFAT/AP-1 and OCT/AP-1 sites , and a consensus AP-1 motif .
Mutation of the nonconsensus -150 AP-1 site to a consensus AP-1 site , or insertion of a CD28RE/AP-1 consensus site upstream of the native -150 CD28RE/AP-1 site restored transactivation of the altered promoter .
These results suggest that the defect at the -150 site may reflect the absence or inactivity of a required factor rather than repression of the IL-2 promoter .
The Journal of Immunology , 2001 , 166 : 6530-6536. activated CD4* T cells ( 1 ) .
Although more recent experi- ments have shown that activated CD8 * T cells can also produce IL-2 , CD4 * T helper cells represent the dominant IL-2-pro-ducing population .
CD8* T cells mediating long term in vivo effector responses depend on IL-2 produced by CD4 * T cells to sustain proliferation and promote survival ( 2 , 3 ) .
Although CD8 * responses to viruses can be elicited in the absence of CD4 * T cells , the establishment of CD8 * T cell memory is severely compromised ( 4-6 ) .
Several studies have suggested that a dominant pathway for CD4 T cell help is via CD40 ligand-mediated activation of APC ( 7-9 ) .
However , a recent report has reaffirmed the importance of direct CD4 *-to-CD8* T cell communication by way of lym-phokines ( 10 ) , such as IL-2 .
CD8 * T cells capable of IL-2 production in response to Ag have been isolated in selected settings , and maintenance of the ability to express IL-2 appears to be dependent on concurrent costimulation with each activation cycle .
However , costimulation is not required for the retention of cytolytic function , a phenomenon termed `` split anergy `` ( 11 ) .
The potential for CD8 * T cells to produce IL-2 in the presence of sufficient costimulatory activity is further supported by the generation of potent CD8 * T cell responses to tumors independent of CD4 responses following in vitro stimulation with B7-transfected tumor cells ( 12 , 13 ) .

E-mail address : pgreen @ u.washington.edu Copyright © 2001 by The American Association of Immunologists require costimulation each time Ag is encountered to sustain the facility for IL-2 expression .
Naive CD8 * T cells from 2C TCR-transgenic mice produced IL-2 following recognition of allogeneic L* target cells bearing B7 costimulatory molecules ( 14 ) , but lost the capacity to produce IL-2 following two sequential stimulations in the absence of CD28 costimulation ( P. Fields , unpublished ob-servations ) .
These studies suggest that all naive CD8 * T cells may initially be competent to produce IL-2 , but lose the ability to sustain growth and survival as a consequence of not receiving the necessary costimulatory signals due to recognition of B7 ~ targets and/or maturation to terminal effector cells .
The requirement for costimulation for CD8 * T cells to produce IL-2 can be circumvented if a sufficiently strong signal is delivered through the TCR .
Effector CD8 * T cells that do not produce IL-2 in response to Ag ( IL-2 ) can be triggered to produce IL-2 by cross-linking the TCR with anti-CD3 Abs , or by treatment with a calcium ionophore , such as ionomycin , in conjunction with a phorbol ester , such as PMA ( 15 ) .
These responses to such nonphysi-ologic stimuli imply that the inability of most effector CD8 * T cells to produce IL-2 in response to Ag is not due to chromosomal inaccessibility of the IL-2 gene , but might instead be due to a mechanism operating at the transcriptional level , similar to what has been found in anergic CD4 * T cells .
Indeed , the block to IL-2 production in anergic CD4 * T cells can also be overcome by stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin ( 16 , 17 ) .
Anergic CD4* T cells share several additional characteristics with IL-2~ CD8 * T cells .
IL-2~ effector CD8 * T cells can proliferate in response to Ag and supplemental exogenous IL-2 , and retain the capacity to produce other cytokines such as IFN-y .
Anergic CD4 * T cells can proliferate following stimulation if exogenous IL-2 is provided , but fail to expand when restimulated with Ag even if costimulation is provided because of a specific inability to produce IL-2 , while retaining the capacity to produce other cytokines such as IL-3 and IFN-y ( 18 ) .
The isolated defect in IL-2 production in anergic CD4 * T cells has been linked to reduced levels of Fos/Jun proteins binding at the -150 AP-1 site in the IL-2 promoter ( 19 ) , as well as to negative regulatory factors targeting the -150 and -180 AP-1 sites ( 20-22 ) .
0022-1767/01/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology We examined the transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 gene in CD8 * T cells to better understand the molecular basis for the failure of effector CD8 * T cells to produce IL-2 in response to Ag .
Our investigation focused on the AP-1 binding sites located in the IL-2 promoter based on studies in CD4 * T cells suggesting that AP-1 is the target of clonal anergy .
AP-1 is composed of homodimers of Jun ( c-Jun , Jun B , and Jun D ) or heterodimers of Jun and Fos ( c-Fos , Fos B , Fra-1 , and Fra-2 ) ( 23 ) .
There are four AP-1 sites in the proximal IL-2 promoter that can bind dimeric combinations of Fos and Jun family members .
Three of the AP-1 sites contain nonconsensus AP-1 motifs adjacent to binding sites for NFAT , CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) , * and OCT , respectively , and both elements of each composite site must be occupied for transactivation of the individual enhancers ( 24-26 ) .
All three of the composite AP-1 sites are required for transactivation of the IL-2 promoter ( 27 ) .
A fourth AP-1 site at -180 from the transcriptional start site is a consensus site in the reverse orientation , but varies from a consensus AP-1 binding site by one base pair in the forward orientation .
The role of the -180 Ap-1 site in IL-2 promoter regulation has not previously been well defined .
However , recent evidence indicates that a complex of cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB ) and cAMP response element modulator binds to this site in anergic CD4 * T cells ( 22 ) , perhaps acting to repress IL-2 gene transcription .
Materials and Methods T cell clones and stimulator lines Four H-2Lreactive CD8 * T cell clones , provided by Frank Fitch ( Uni-versity of Chicago , Chicago , IL ) , were chosen for evaluation .
L3 and DB45 ( 28 , 29 ) do not produce IL-2 in response to antigenic stimulation ( IL-2 ) , and Ld 8.6.1 and 2C ( 30 , 31 ) produce IL-2 in response to Ag ( IL-2 * ) .
All clones were restimulated every 14 days with allogeneic BALB/c spleno-cytes plus 12.5-25 U/ml recombinant human IL-2 ( Chiron , Emeryville , CA ) .
The -expressing murine mastocytoma P815 , also obtained from Frank Fitch , and the murine BALB/c tumor , LSTRA , maintained in our laboratory , were used as stimulator cells .
P815 was transfected with both B7-1 and B7-2 to provide costimulation , and LSTRA naturally expresses both B7-1 and B7-2 .
All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640-HEPES supplemented with 10 % FCS ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) , 4 mM L-glutamine , 50 U/ml penicillin , 50 pg/ml streptomycin , and 5 X 10~° M 2-ME .
Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface molecules on T cell clones Cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software ( BD Biosciences , Mountain View , CA . )
.
All Abs were purchased from PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) , unless otherwise noted .
CD3 and CD8 expression were evaluated with PE-conjugated anti-CD3 ( 145-2011 ) and PE-conjugated anti-CD8 « ( 53-6.7 ) .
PE-conjugated anti-CD4 ( GK1.5 ) was used as a control for nonspecific staining .
CD28 expression was evaluated with mAb 37.51 , followed by FITC-labeled rabbit anti-hamster IgG ( Jack-son ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) using hamster IgG anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin Ab Ha4/8 as an isotype control .
RT-PCR analysis of cytokine gene transcription T cell clones were cultured at 37°C for 6 h in six-well plates ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) with medium alone , an equal number of stimulator cells , plate-bound anti-CD3 ( 2C11 ) at 1 pg/ml , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ( 37.51 ) at 1 ug/ml each , or 10 ng/ml PMA plus 1 pM ionomycin ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) .
Cells were washed twice with PBS , RNA was extracted with RNAgents Total RNA Isolation kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , and reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II ( Life Technologies , Gaithers-burg , MD ) .
The cDNA was amplified with primers specific for murine IL-2 or IFN-y , and all reactions included B-actin primers to control for cDNA input .
Forward ( F ) and reverse ( R ) primers were generated by Life Technol- * Abbreviations used in this paper : CD28RE , CD28 response element ; B-gal , B-ga-lactosidase ; CPS , counts per second ; CREB , cAMP response element-binding protein ; ERK , extracellular signal-regulated kinase ; FRK , Fos regulating kinase ; JNK , Jun amino-terminal kinase ; PCR SOEing , PCR Splice Overlap Extension technique ; F , forward ; R , reverse .

PCR was repeated for 25 cycles for IFN-y and 35 cycles for IL-2 .
PCR was performed on the DeltaCycler II ( Ericomp , San Diego , CA ) .
PCR products were resolved on 1.5 % agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining .
Reporter gene constructs The LacZH constructs containing multimers of IL-2 promoter enhancer elements driving expression of the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene , with the hygromycin resistance gene ( H ) for selection of stable transfectants have been described elsewhere ( 32 ) .
Briefly , IL-2-LacZH contains -326 to +47 of the proximal human IL-2 promoter ; NFAT/AP-1-LacZH contains three copies of the NFAT/AP-1 binding site ( -286 to -257 ) linked to the minimal IL-2 promoter ( -72 to +47 ) encoding the TATA box and transcriptional start site ; OCT/AP-1-LacZH contains four copies of the OCT/AP-1 binding site ( -93 to -65 ) attached to the minimal IL-2 promoter ; and CD28RE/AP-1-LacZH contains four copies of the CD28RE/ AP-1 binding region ( - 159 to -134 ) linked to the minimal IL-2 promoter .
A consensus AP-1 reporter gene construct was generated using oligo-nucleotides ( oligo ) representing the AP-1 binding site from the human metallothionein gene ( 33 ) : tegaCGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA and tc gaTTCCGGCTGAGTCATCAAGCG ( AP-1 binding site underlined , XhoI overlap bases in lower case italics ) .
Oligos were annealed and ligated into LacZH containing the minimal IL-2 promoter .
A plasmid with six copies of the AP-1 consensus binding site in the forward orientation and one copy in the reverse orientation was selected for transfection studies .
Fluorescent sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Fluorescent Sequencer using Taq Dye Terminator reagents ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) .
Mutations to the IL-2 promoter were accomplished using the PCR Splice Overlap Extension technique ( PCR SOEing ) ( 34 ) , with IL-2-LacZH serving as a template .
External primers were the same for all PCR SOEing reactions .
The external forward primer ( EX `` ) ATCGATGTTTTCTGAGT TACTT is complementary to the 5 ' end of the 320-bp IL-2 promoter , and the external reverse primer ( EX® ) TTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTA is complementary to the 5 ' end of the lacZ gene .
In the internal primers listed below , the binding sites are underlined and mutations are in bold type .
The -180 AP-1 site was mutated to a nonbinding site by pairing EX `` with the -180 AP-1 Null reverse primer CCAAAGACTGCAAGAATGGATG TAG in one PCR , and EX `` with the -180 AP-1 Null forward primer CTACATCCATTCTTGCAGTCTTTGG in a separate PCR .
The -150 AP-1 site was replaced with a consensus AP-1 site by pairing EX `` and the -150 AP-1 consensus reverse primer CTCTTCTGATGAGTCATTG GAATTTC in one PCR , and EX® with the -150 AP-1 consensus forward primer GAAATTCCAATGACTCATCAGAGAG in a separate PCR .
A composite CD28RE/AP-1 consensus site was added to the IL-2 promoter by pairing EX `` with the CD28RE/AP-1 consensus reverse primer ATTTCTT TAAACCCCCAAAGACTGAGTCA , and then EX `` with the CD28RE/AP-1 consensus forward primer TTTGGGGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAT GACTCA .
The products from each of the sets of PCR were combined and used as overlapping templates in PCR SOEing reactions with external primers to generate the IL-2 promoter with the designated mutations ( see Fig .
3A ) .
The fidelity of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing .
Stable transfection of murine T cell clones and P815 T cell clones were transfected by electroporation at 250 mV , 940 F ( Pro-genetor II ; Hoefer , San Francisco , CA ) 6 days after antigenic stimulation with irradiated BALB/c splenocytes .
All reporter gene plasmids were lin-earized 5 ' of the promoter of interest .
Electroporated cells were selected for 2-3 wk in medium containing 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin .
Aliquots of the hygromycin-resistant cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA plus 1 M ionomycin for 3 h , then assayed histochemically for B-galactosidase ( B-gal ) expression ( 35 ) .
It was necessary to subclone the majority of transfected lines to enrich for B-gal-expressing cells .
B-gal* lines were sub-cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates , and only transfectants that expressed negligible B-gal in the absence of stimulation were selected .
cDNAs encoding murine B7-1 and B7-2 were cloned into the eukaryotic vectors pNA ' and pHA ' , respectively , as described ( 14 ) .
Both constructs were linearized , then transfected into P815 cells via electroporation ( 250 mV , 940 uF ) .
Electroporated cells were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6532 TRANSCRIPTIONAL BLOCK AT -150 AP-1 SITE IN CD # 8 # * T CELLS ( Sigma ) and 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin B ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianap-olis , IN ) .
Antibiotic-resistant cells were screened for both B7-1 and B7-2 expression by flow cytometry using FITC-coupled anti-B7-1 ( 1G10 ) and anti-B7-2 ( GL-1 ) .
Positive cells were sorted into 96-well culture plates ( Costar ) .
Surface expression of B7-1 and B7-2 on subclones was determined by flow cytometry , and a subclone expressing matched high levels of B7-1 and B7-2 was selected for use as a stimulator cell line .
Transfected P815 cells were maintained in medium with 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin B , and assessed by flow cytometry periodically to verify stable B7-1 and B7-2 expression .
Chemiluminescent assay for quantitation of B-gal activity $ B-gal activity was measured using the chemiluminescent substrate Galac-ton-Star ( Tropix , Bedford , MA ) .
T cells ( 1.25 X 10° ) were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates for 6 h at 37°C with medium alone , an equal number of P815 stimulator cells , or 10 ng/ml PMA plus 1 M ionomycin , washed with PBS , and lysed with buffer provided by the manufacturer .
Samples were incubated with chemiluminescent substrate for 1 h in Dynex Mi-croFLUOR black 96-well microplates ( Dynex Technologies , Chantilly , VA ) .
Light output was measured using the Single Photon Count mode at 24°C for 1.2 s/well on a Packard Top Count microplate luminometer ( Packard , Meriden , CT ) .
Due to variations in B-gal activity among subclones possibly resulting from a variable number of integrated transgenes , the induction of B-gal activity in response to stimulation was compared with that detected in unstimulated cells for a panel of six subclones from each transfectant .
The subclones representing the mean level of -gal induction for each stimulation condition are shown as the representative transfectants ( see Figs .
4- 6 ) .
Results IL-2~ and IL-2 `` CD8 T cell clones express comparable levels of CD3 , CD8 , and CD28 One possible explanation for the inability of some effector CD8 * T cells to produce IL-2 is decreased signal strength due to down-regulation of critical signaling molecules .
Therefore , surface expression of CD3 , CD8 , and CD28 on CD8 * T cell clones was assessed by flow cytometry .
The IL-2~ clones , L3 and DB45 , and the IL-2* clones , 2C and Ld 8.6.1 , expressed approximately equivalent levels of CD3 and CD8 ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
CD28 was expressed at the highest levels on L3 , and was approximately equivalent on DB45 and 2C , but slightly lower on Ld 8.6.1 .
( Fig .
1C ) .
These results suggest that reduction of CD3 , CD8 , or CD28 on L3 and DB45 did not account for the inability of these clones to produce IL-2 in response to Ag .
IL-2~ CD8¢ T cells do not transcribe IL-2 mRNA in response to Ag Transcription of the IL-2 and IFN-y genes was assessed under varying conditions : either medium alone , or after stimulation with LSTRA , P815 , P815/B7-1 + 2 transfectants , plate-bound anti-CD3 , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 , or PMA plus ionomycin .
All clones were assessed 6 h after stimulation following a rest period of 10 days from the previous stimulation .
IFN-y mRNA was induced in response to all stimuli , indicating that the cells were activated ( Fig .
24 ) .
No baseline transcription of the IL-2 gene was detectable in CD8 * T cell clones cultured in medium alone ( Fig .
2B ) .
Following stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3 , anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 , or PMA plus ionomycin , IL-2 mRNA was transcribed by all CD8 * T cell clones .
In response to allogeneic stimulation with LSTRA , P815 cells , or P815/B7-1 + 2 transfectants , the IL-2 * CD8 * T cell clones 2C and Ld 8.6.1 transcribed IL-2 mRNA , whereas the IL-2~ CD8 * T cell clones L3 and DB45 did not transcribe detectable IL-2 mRNA .
Thus , the restriction of IL-2 production in CD8 * T cell subsets is controlled at least in part at the level of mRNA transcription and/or stability .

The shaded curve represents unstained cells , and the unshaded curve represents staining with the labeled Ab .
The proximal IL-2 promoter is not transactivated in IL-2 CD8 * T cells Transactivation of the proximal IL-2 promoter was evaluated in response to varying stimuli .
The proximal IL-2 promoter-LacZH reporter gene construct ( Fig .
34 ) was stably transfected into the IL-2~ CD8 * clones L3 and DB45 , and into the IL-2 * CD8 * clone 2C , which most closely matched the surface phenotype of the IL-2~ CD8 * clones .
Ld 8.6.1 was not used in reporter gene analyses due to variable stability of transgenes in this clone .
Reporter gene expression was detected in both L3 and DB45 in response to PMA plus ionomycin , but no significant activity was observed after 6 h in response to antigenic stimulation with P815 or P85/ B7-1 + 2 ( Fig .
4A ) .
In contrast , the IL-2 `` CD8 * T cell clone 2C transactivated the IL-2 promoter in response to P815 , and costimulation with B7-1 and B7-2 enhanced transactivation compared with stimulation with P815 alone .
Analysis of a panel of L3 and DB45 subclones failed to detect any cells capable of transactivating the IL-2 promoter in response to Ag , or Ag plus costimulation .
Disruption of the potentially inhibitory -180 AP-1 binding site does not restore transactivation of the IL-2 promoter We evaluated whether a negative regulatory factor similar to that identified in anergic CD4* T cells played a role in negatively regulating IL-2 promoter transactivation in CD8 * T cells by removing the binding site for the putative inhibitor .
The -180 AP-1 site in the IL-2 promoter was converted to a nonbinding site by mutating the TCAGTCA AP-1 motif to TCTTGCA ( Fig .
34 ) , because an identical 3-bp mutation restored transactivation of the IL-2 promoter in anergic CD4 * cells ( 21 ) .
In L3 and DB45 transfectants , the -180 AP-1 null version of the IL-2 promoter was very weakly activated in response to PMA plus ionomycin ( Fig .
4B ) .
This reduced activity in comparison to the native IL-2 promoter suggested a potential positive rather than negative contribution from this site in CD8 * T cells .
No significant response was 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology A. IFNy B. IL-2 yMW1234567 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 MW L3 -IMy [ -ACTN peas -IMy pan oi 2C IFNy frACTN Ld 8.6.1 [ -ACTN FIGURE 2 .

observed in L3 or DB45 transfectants following stimulation with Ag or Ag plus costimulation .
Analysis of multiple subclones of L3 and DB45 confirmed that the -180 AP-1 mutation severely reduced IL-2 promoter activity .
IL-2 `` 2C transfectants bearing the -180 AP-1 null mutation exhibited marginal promoter activity compared with the native IL-2 promoter in response to PMA plus ionomycin , Ag , or Ag plus costimulation , with only 1.3-fold induction over levels in unstimulated cells .
Thus , the - 180 AP-1 site appears to provide a positive signal , and is not responsible for repressing IL-2 transcription in CDS* T cells .
The -150 CD28RE/AP-1 site is selectively not transactivated in response to Ag in IL-2~ CD8 T cells The three enhancer binding sites for NFAT/AP-1 , OCT/AP-1 , and CD28RE/AP-1 have been identified as critical domains controlling IL-2 transcription in CD4 * T cells ( 27 ) .
To evaluate transactivation of these elements , reporter constructs ( Fig .
3B ) were transfected into L3 , DB45 , and 2C .
Transactivation of the NFAT/AP-1 binding site was observed in response to PMA plus ionomycin , Ag stimulation , and Ag plus costimulation in all three clones ( Fig .
54 ) .
Analysis of multiple subclones for each transfectant confirmed transactivation in response to all stimulation conditions .
The OCT/AP-1-LacZ reporter construct demonstrated inducible -gal activity in all three clones in response to PMA plus ionomycin , Ag , or Ag plus costimulation ( Fig .
5B ) , which was confirmed for L3 by analysis of multiple subclones .
Although this binding site did not induce high levels of reporter gene activity in any of the CD8 * T cell clones , no significant differences were evident between the IL-2 * clone and IL-2~ clones .
Thus , neither the NFAT/AP-1 nor OCT/AP-1 binding site appear to be targets for differential regulation of the IL-2 promoter .
In contrast , the IL-2~ clones L3 and DB45 , despite being CD28 * , induced the CD28RE/AP-1-LacZ reporter construct only in response to PMA plus ionomycin , and failed to induce B-gal activity in response to Ag , even in the presence of costimulation ( Fig .
5C ) .

and DB45 subclones .
However , IL-2 * 2C transfectants exhibited reporter gene activity in response to all three stimuli , with the strongest response induced by Ag plus costimulation .
The activity of this enhancer element in all three clones mirrored those observed for the intact proximal IL-2 promoter in response to PMA plus ionomycin and Ag recognition .
These results suggest that the CD28RE/AP-1 element may be subject to differential regulation in subpopulations of CD8 * T cells .
IL-2~ CD8¢ T cells express functional AP-1 complexes Although all of the analyzed reporter constructs of multimerized binding elements represent composite sites containing an AP-1 binding site , each composite site may bind different combinations of Jun and/or Fos family members .
Therefore , to determine whether a general defect in AP-1 or a defect specific to the nonconsensus -150 AP-1 site exists in IL-2~ CD8 * T cells , transactivation of a consensus AP-1 site was examined .
The consensus AP-1 site differs from the CD28RE/AP-1 site in two significant ways : it does not contain the binding site for the CD28 response complex , and it exhibits higher affinity for the Jun/Fos heterodimer ( 36 ) .
The multimerized consensus AP-1-LacZ reporter gene ( Fig .
3B ) was induced following activation of L3 , DB45 , and 2C with PMA plus ionomycin , Ag , and Ag plus costimulation ( Fig .

These results , confirmed by analysis of a panel of subclones for each transfectant , suggest that functional AP-1 complexes are being induced in IL-2~ CD8 * T cells in response to Ag recognition .
Mutation of -150 AP-1 site to a consensus AP-1 site restores transactivation of the IL-2 promoter The failure of IL-2~ CD8 * T cells to transactivate the CD28RE/ AP-1 site could reflect either a defect in the CD28 response complex that binds to the CD28RE and/or a defect in specific AP-1 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6534 TRANSCRIPTIONAL BLOCK AT -150 AP-1 SITE IN CD # 8 # * T CELLS A B IL-2 ~180 AP-1 PROMOTER MUTATION 8 L3 6 * ?

complexes required to transactivate the AP-1 component of the composite site , because both sites must be occupied for enhancer activity ( 25 ) .
To directly assess the AP-1 site , we left the CD28RE intact , but replaced the native -150 AGAGTCA AP-1 site with the consensus AP-1 motif TGACTCA , and transfected this modified IL-2 promoter-LacZ reporter construct ( Fig .
34 ) into L3 , DB45 , and 2C .
In response to PMA plus ionomycin , all three clones transactivated the mutated IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
6B ) .
More-over , in contrast to the native IL-2 promoter , detectable B-gal activity from the modified -150 AP-1 consensus IL-2 promoter was induced by Ag in L3 and DB45 , and was further increased by costimulation .
Clone 2C exhibited high levels of B-gal activity in response to Ag and Ag plus costimulation .
This pattern of activation was confirmed by subclone analyses with L3 and 2C .
Thus , conversion of the -150 AP-1 site to a consensus AP-1 site appears sufficient to at least partially restore IL-2 promoter activity in response to Ag in IL-2~ CD8 * T cell clones .
Transactivation of the IL-2 promoter containing the -150 AP-1 consensus mutation in IL-2~ CD8* clones could have resulted from replacement of an AP-1 site requiring specific AP-1 family members that are not present with a binding site capable of being transactivated by alternate AP-1 complexes , or from disruption of a site that previously bound a negative regulator .
To distinguish between these two possibilities , the native IL-2 promoter was altered by insertion of a modified CD28RE/AP-1 element containing a consensus AP-1 site between the -180 and -150 enhancer sites ( Fig .
3A ) .
This mutation adds a functional CD28RE/AP-1 site to the promoter while leaving the native CD28RE/AP-1 site intact and potentially capable of binding a negative regulator .

and to Ag plus costimulation in all three CD8 * clones ( Fig .
6C ) .
This pattern of activation in response to all stimuli was consistent among all L3 and 2C subclones .
However , we noted that higher levels of reporter gene activity were detected in the 2C transfectant than in L3 and DB45 .
This increase might reflect a greater trans-gene copy number in the 2C transfectant , but we can not completely rule out the possibility of partial repressor activity at this site in L3 and DB45 .
Thus , the addition of a functional CD28RE/ AP-1 site could conceivably override or displace a repressor binding at the -ISOAP-1 site in the native promoter , or alternatively restore transactivation by providing a composite site that can bind AP-1 complexes induced in response to Ag recognition .
Discussion Recent evidence demonstrating that a CREB/cAMP response element modulator complex binds to the -180 AP-1 site in anergic CD4* T cells and negatively regulates IL-2 transcription suggested that a similar or related complex may restrict IL-2 expression in effector CD8 * T cells .
However , mutations we made in the -180 AP-1 site , known to disrupt that site and restore promoter activity in anergic CD4 * T cells ( 21 ) , suggested an alternative mechanism must be operative .
In addition to the inhibitory mechanism operating at the -180 AP-1 site , a defect at the -150 AP-1 site has been implicated in anergy induction ( 19-21 ) , and we have identified that this site is also targeted in the restriction of IL-2 production by effector CD8 * T cells .
One possibility for the observed failure of IL-2~ CD8 * T cells to transactivate the nonconsensus -150 AP-1 site in response to Ag is that the obligatory transcription factors were not induced or 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology A B C AP 150 AP CD28RE/AP-1 MULTIMER MUTATION ADDITION L3 ( 7° % Ed D. o DB45 N 0 % d D. o 2C $ 0 i ® O. o { Q unstim Mire E psis pais ez-1+2 FIGURE 6 .

activated .
Members of the activating transcription factor-1/CREB family have been shown to transactivate the -150 AP-1 site ( 37 ) , representing one possible complex that could act to differentially regulate the -150 AP-1 site .
A second possibility is that the requisite Fos or Jun family member ( s ) were not induced or appropriately activated in response to antigenic stimulation .
AP-1 complexes can consist of different dimeric Fos and Jun family members and exhibit variable DNA binding specificity .
Although Jun/Jun homodimers can transactivate AP-1 sites , Fos/Jun heterodimers are more potent transactivators ( 38 ) .
The nonconsensus -150 AP-1 site is a `` low affinity `` site for the Fos/Jun heterodimer ( 36 ) , and may require a specific combination of Fos/Jun family members for activation .
By contrast , the NFAT/AP-1 site and consensus AP-1 sites are `` high affinity `` binding sites and can be transactivated with both Fos/Jun and Jun/Jun dimers ( 39 ) .
Hence , the ability of IL-2~ CD8 * T cells to transactivate the NFAT/AP-1 , OCT/AP-1 , and consensus AP-1 sites but not the -150 AP-1 site could result from limitation or inactivation of a required factor , such as one of the Fos proteins .
Several Fos family members such as Fral , Fra2 , and an alternatively spliced form of FosB lack transcriptional activation domains ( 40 , 41 ) .
These transcriptionally inactive forms of Fos might have preferential affinity for the -150 AP-1 site while not efficiently binding and interfering with transactivation of the NFAT/AP-1 , OCT/AP-1 , or consensus AP-1 sites .
Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that antigenic stimulation of IL-2~ CD8 * T cells does not result in the induction or activation of the specific nuclear proteins required to transactivate the -150 AP-1 site , and consequently the entire IL-2 promoter is rendered inactive .
Protein-DNA interactions at distal sites within the IL-2 promoter have been demonstrated to be unstable if 6535 even one transcription factor is missing ( 42 ) .
The possibility that a missing factor is responsible for the differences in cytokine secretion patterns in IL-2 * and IL-2~ CD8 * T cells is consistent with studies using heterokaryons between CD4* and CD8 # * T cell clones .
In those studies , fusion of the CD8 * T cell clone L3 with an CD4* fusion partner did not repress secretion of IL-2 , suggesting the absence of a dominant negative regulatory factor for IL-2 expression in CD8 * T cells ( 43 ) .
In contrast , heterokaryon formation between nonanergic and anergic CD4 * T cells disrupted transactivation of the IL-2 gene in the fusion partner , suggesting the presence of a dominant negative regulatory mechanism for restriction of IL-2 production in anergic CD4 * T cells ( 44 ) .
Although we did not examine potential signaling defects in this study , the data presented suggest that the failure of effector CD8 * T cells to produce IL-2 may lie in their failure to adequately transmit a costimulatory signal , resulting in the inability to transactivate the -150 AP-1 site .
Identification of the specific transcription factors that bind to the -150 AP-1 site in CD8 * T cells in response to Ag would provide insight into which signaling molecules might be involved in the restriction of IL-2 production in effector CD8 * T cells .
In light of the potential role of activating transcription factor/CREB family members at the -150 AP-1 site ( 37 ) , it might be of interest to examine p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase .
Other candidates include extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) , Fos regulating kinase ( FRK ) , and Jun amino-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , that function downstream of Ras , and act together to regulate the expression and function of Fos and Jun proteins ( 45-47 ) .
ERK induces the transcription of fos mRNA by phosphory-lating the Elk-1 transcription factor in the fos promoter ( 48 ) , FRK acts to enhance transcriptional activation of Fos proteins by phosphorylation ( 46 ) , and JNK phosphorylates and activates Jun proteins ( 47 ) .
In anergic CD4 * T cells , Ras activation was shown to be selectively blocked , leading to reduced activity of ERK and JNK , but treatment with PMA , which bypasses the TCR to activate the Ras signaling pathway , restored activation of both ERK and JNK and partially restored IL-2 production ( 16 , 17 ) .
Our observation that stimulation with ionomycin plus PMA induced IL-2 gene transcription in CD8 * T cells that do not produce IL-2 in response to Ag suggests that the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may not be efficiently activated by Ag stimulation in IL-2 , CD8 * T cells .
Although NFAT/AP-1 , OCT/AP-1 , and a consensus AP-1 site were transactivated in response to Ag , this does not rule out the possibility that JNK was inactive in IL-2~ CD8 * T cells .
Studies in anergic cells have shown that some AP-1 sites remain functional , despite the apparent block in JNK activation ( 20 ) .
This suggests that jun proteins that are not phosphorylated by JNK , such as JunB , could act to transactivate certain AP-1 sites ( 49 ) .
Even if JNK was active , transactivation of the -150 AP-1 site also requires transcriptionally active fos protein .
The only mechanism for inducing and activating Fos proteins is through ERK and FRK , which are both dependent on Ras activity .
Consequently , a block in the Ras pathway could specifically affect the expression and activation of Fos proteins , leading to impaired transactivation of sites requiring Fos/Jun heterodimers and resulting in the failure of effector CD8 * T cells to produce IL-2 .
CD8 * T cells may have evolved to lose the capacity for IL-2 expression to provide an additional regulatory mechanism for avoiding autoimmune tissue damage caused by self-reactive CTL that escape thymic deletion .
Although there are settings in which CD8 * T cells can respond independently of CD4 * T cells , such as to clear certain acute viral infections , immune responses in the absence of CD4 help generally are limited in magnitude and do not persist long-term ( 2-6 ) .
Mechanistically , the division of roles in the T cell compartment could be governed by the different types of 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6536 TRANSCRIPTIONAL BLOCK AT -150 AP-1 SITE IN CD # 8 # * T CELLS APC recognized by CD4* and CD8 # * T cell subsets .
CD4* T lymphocytes recognize cells bearing Ag in the context of class II MHC , and these `` professional `` APC usually express B7 molecules .
Such APC are capable of delivering both a signal through the TCR and a costimulatory signal through CD28 , resulting in IL-2 production by CD4 * T cells .
CD8 * T lymphocytes recognize targets expressing Ag in the context of class I MHC , and most of these cells lack the costimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2 .
After encounter with Ag on class I targets in the absence of costimulation , the CD8 * T cell may become `` anergized `` with respect to IL-2 production while retaining effector function ( 11 ) .
The molecular mechanism for inducing and maintaining this state of split anergy in CD8 * T cells appears to share some , but not all , of the features that have been described in anergic CD4* T cells .
A greater understanding of the molecular events leading to the anergic state in CD8 * T cells could have implications for therapeutic intervention in a variety of clinical settings .
