Vitamin D Receptor Expression in Human Lymphocytes SIGNAL REQUIREMENTS AND CHARACTERIZATION BY WESTERN BLOTS AND DNA SEQUENCING* ( Received for publication , November 19 , 1990 ) Xiao-Peng Yu , Hanna Mocharla , Frank G.

Manolagast From the Section of Endocrinology and Metabolism , Veterans Administration Medical Center , and the Department of Medicine , Indiana University , Indianapolis , Indiana 46202 The signals controlling the expression of the receptor protein for 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; in normal human lymphocytes and the relationship of this protein to the classical vitamin D receptor were examined .
Lymphocytes activated with the OKT3 antibody to the T-cell antigen receptor expressed fewer binding sites as compared to lymphocytes that were activated by the polyclonal activator phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) .
However , combination of OKT3 and phorbol myristate acetate produced a concentration of binding sites similar to the PHA-activated cells .
The receptor from OKT3 and OKT3 + phorbol myristate acetate-activated lymphocytes exhibited decreased binding to DNA-cellulose compared to PHA-activated lymphocytes .
In lymphocytes activated either by PHA or OKT3 ( but not in resting cells ) , a 50-kDa species cross-reacting with a monoclonal antibody against the intestinal vitamin D receptor was detected .
Finally , RNA from activated lymphocytes was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers flanking the 196 base pair long region encoding the DNA-binding domain of the human intestinal receptor .
The amplified product showed an identical nucleotide sequence to the DNA-binding domain of the human intestinal receptor .
These findings suggest that expression of the 1,25- ( OH ) D ; receptor in lymphocytes is triggered by distinct and contingent signals , and that the protein and the mRNA encoding it are identical to the classical vitamin D receptor .
During the last few years it has been established that the hormonal form of vitamin Ds , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; ( 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ) , ' has a much wider biologic role than was previously thought ( 1 , 2 ) .
Thus , in addition to its classical role in mineral and skeletal homeostasis , 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; has been found to regulate the growth , differentiation , and function of a broad range of cells , including lymphocytes ( 3-5 ) .

role of 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; has been provided by the elucidation of the mechanism of its action .
In the classical tissues for 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ( intestine , bone , kidney ) , the hormonal effects are mediated via specific nuclear receptors ( 6 ) .
Recently , complementary DNA clones of the vitamin D receptor gene have been isolated , and the structures of the gene and its mRNA have been determined ( 7 , 8 ) .
The gene belongs to the same family of genes that encode the receptors for the other steroid hormones and shares extensive homologies with the members of this group ( 9 ) .
We and others have found previously that cells of the hematolymphopoietic tissue possess a receptor-like binding protein for 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10-12 ) .
In monocytes this protein is expressed constitutively .
In peripheral blood T and B lymphocytes , however , the receptor-like protein is expressed upon activation ( 13-15 ) .
1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor-like binding , is also found in vivo ( ie .
without in vitro activation ) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of rheumatoid arthritis patients ( 16 ) and in surgical specimens of human thymus and tonsils ( 17 ) .
In both these tissues , a positive correlation between 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; binding and the activation state of lymphocytes has been found .
Interestingly enough , one subset of T lymphocytes that reside in the thymus express the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor-like protein constitutively ( 18 , 19 ) .
The 1,25- ( OH ) .D ; receptor-bearing cells belong to the peanut agglutinin-negative cell population that is localized in the medulla of the gland and exhibit a more functionally mature phenotype ( 20 ) .
In contrast to the peanut agglutinin-negative cells , the less mature peanut agglutinin-positive cells that are localized in the cortex of thymus do not express 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; binding .
From these observations , it has become apparent that the 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; receptor-like protein of normal lymphocytes is highly regulated , so that it is expressed at distinct stages of maturation and upon the reception of external signals that lead lymphocytes along the pathway to immune function .
It is not known , however , how the expression of the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor-like protein is regulated in lymphocytes and whether this protein is identical or different from the one that is expressed constitutively in the classical target tissues of the hormone .
By using agents that mediate only a subset of intracellular events and thus an incomplete signal of lymphocyte activation , earlier studies have revealed heterogeneous patterns of gene expression indicating that a multiplicity of signaling pathways extend from the cell surface to the level of transcription ( 21 , 22 ) .
It is now well established that in most T-cells at least two signals are required to initiate the activation process , one supplied by the T-cells antigen receptor and the other by accessory cells ( 23 ) .
The requirement for the first of these two signals can be met in part by lectins or antibodies to the T-cell receptor complex ; while the requirement for the second ( accessory cells and their products ) can be mimicked 7588 The 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; Receptor in Human Lymphocytes by agents that activate protein kinase C. The different signals generated upon activation of lymphocytes are thought to be integrated at the level of the responsive genes to enhance their transcription ( 21 , 23 ) .
To better understand the mechanism underlining the appearance of 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor-like binding in lymphocytes following activation , we examined the influence of distinct intracellular signaling pathways on this event .
Specifi-cally , we attempted to dissect the contributions of the two major signaling pathways in lymphocyte activation , namely , the T-cell antigen receptor and the protein kinase C signaling pathways .
The influence of the former pathway was assessed using the OKT3 monoclonal antibody which recognizes the invariant CD3 proteins of the T-cell receptor complex , while the influence of the latter pathway was examined using the protein kinase activator phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) .
Results from cells activated with the above stimuli were then compared to results obtained from lymphocytes activated by PHA which has been shown to trigger both the T-cell receptor pathway ( CD3 ) as well as the CD2 , and E rosette receptor ( 24 , 25 ) .
In addition , we characterized the lymphocyte receptor for 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; by means of Western blots and partial DNA sequencing .
Our findings suggest that , similar to other activation-induced genes in lymphocytes , expression of the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor is triggered by at least two distinct and perhaps contingent signals arising from the T-cell antigen receptor and the protein kinase C-dependent intracellular pathway .
In addition , they establish that the protein and the mRNA encoding the receptor in peripheral blood lymphocytes are identical to those encoded by the gene that is expressed constitutively in the classical target tissues of the hormone .

Cell Isolation and Culture-Peripheral blood was obtained from normal volunteers from either sex or from buffy coats in accordance with the regulations of the Indiana University Review Board , and mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation ( 27 ) .
The cells were washed three times and resuspended ( 1-2 x 10 % /ml ) in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inacti-vated fetal bovine serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , antibiotics ( 100 ug/ml streptomycin , 100 units/ml penicillin ) , and 25 mM Hepes .
The cells were then incubated in plastic culture flasks ( Falcon , Becton Dick-inson , Oxnard , CA ) for 1 h at 37 °C in 5 % CO ; , 95 % air .
The adherence step was performed in order to eliminate the majority of the adherent monocytes , which are known to possess receptors for 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; 7589 ( 16 ) .

After incubation , intact cells were washed twice with saline supplemented with 0.2 % bovine serum albumin .
Cytosols were prepared as described above and were layered onto 4-24 % sucrose density gradients prepared by layering 0.65 ml each of 24 , 20 , 16 , 12 , 8 , and 4 % sucrose in KETD-0.3 into polyalcohol tubes ( Beckman ) .
The gradients were centrifuged for 19 h at 135,000 x g. Fractions ( 20 xX 0.2 ml ) were collected with a Beckman Fraction Recovery System and aliquots were counted for radioactivity .

Flow Cytometric Analysis of PBMC Surface Markers-At the end of 72 h of incubation , PBMC were collected , washed , and counted .
Resting , PHA-activated and OKT3-activated cells were washed in PBS containing 1 % sodium azide and 1 % BSA and stained with monoclonal antibodies CD4 and CD8 directly conjugated with fluorescein and phycoerythrin for 30 min at 4°C .
Stained cells were washed twice with PBS , fixed in 1.0 ml of PBS with 1 % paraformaldehyde , and analyzed on a Coulter Epics Profile II flow cytometer with a 25 milliwatt air-cooled argon laser filtered optimally to detect phycoerythrin and fluorescein fluorescence .
Through the use of KC56 ( CD 45-pan lymphoid marker ) we were able to determine the purity of the gated population .
When the value of KC56 was below 95 % ( less than 95 % lymphoid positive ) , normalization was performed .
This provided a more accurate percentage of lymphocyte positive cells for a given surface marker .
Immunologic Detection of 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; , Receptors-Crude lymphocyte cytosols and enriched preparations of the human intestinal receptor were electrophoresed on 7.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and then electrophoretically transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane using a TE42 Transphor apparatus ( Hoefer Scientific Instruments , San Francisco , CA ) .
Complete transfer of all proteins was achieved at 3.5 h at 20 V. Upon completion of the transfer , the nitrocellulose membranes were subject to immunoblot analysis as follows .

RESULTS Effects of Distinct Activation Signals on 1,25- ( OH ) , ffFH ] Ds : Binding in Lymphocytes-Comparison of sucrose density gradient sedimentation of the 1,25- ( OH ) ; [ °H ] D ; binding in lymphocytes activated either with PHA or OKT3 from three different normal donors is illustrated in Fig .
1 .
For each preparation , cells were divided into 2 aliquots and incubated for 72 h with either PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) or OKT3 ( 1/250 dilution ) .
In all three samples , we detected a singlké displaceable binding peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.3 s , indicating that at least by this criterion , the binding proteins were identical in the two activation systems .
However , the height of the radioactive peak and the area under the peak was considerably less in the OKT # -activated cells as compared to the PHA-activated cells .
This finding was reproduced in all 15 samples from normal donors we examined .
The lower binding of 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; in OKT3-activated lymphocytes as compared to PHA-activated lymphocytes , seen in the sucrose gradients , was due to a difference in the concentration of the binding studies as indicated by the results of the experiment illustrated in Fig .
2 .
Indeed , Scatchard analysis of the binding in cytosol preparations from either activa- The 1,25- ( OH ) ; Ds3 Receptor in Human Lymphocytes tion system demonstrated that the OKT3-induced activation led to the appearance of fewer binding sites as compared to the PHA-induced activation .
The affinity of the binding proteins for the ligand ( k , ) , on the other hand , was indistinguishable between the two activation systems .
To investigate the possibility that the difference in the concentration of the binding sites could be due to a different time course of the expression of the 1,25- ( OH ) , [ °H ] D ; -binding protein in cells activated by the two different agents , binding was determined at different time points following exposure of the PBMC to the two activation stimuli .
In both systems , 1,25- ( OH ) , [ } H ] D ; binding was maximal at 48 h and declined thereafter .
At each time point , however , OKT3-activated cells exhibited lower binding than the PHA -activated cells ( Fig .
3 ) , In all the above experiments , the differences in 1,25- ( OH ) , [ °HIJDs binding could not be accounted for by differences in the degree of activation induced by the different stimuli since the rate of DNA synthesis was comparable .
And , even when the 1,25- ( OH ) ; [ °H ] D ; binding was corrected per rate of DNA synthesis only a fraction ( 30-60 % ) of the binding seen with PHA could be elicited by the OKT3 monoclonal antibody ( data not shown ) .
The lack of an association between the concentration of the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; -binding sites and the rate of DNA synthesis was most convincingly demonstrated , however , in the experiment shown in Fig .
3 .
As seen in the inset of this figure in the PHA-activated cells , [ °H ] thymidine incorporation was similar at 48 , 72 , and 96 h following exposure of the cells to the activation agent , while in OKT3-activated cells , there was a progressive increase in [ *H ] thy-midine incorporation with time following activation .
These rates of DNA synthesis , however , were completely dissociated from the changes in the apparent concentration of the binding sites .
The signal-dependent differences in the number of binding sites could not be accounted for by differences in the cell types present in the cultures following stimulation with the particular activation stimulus , as evidenced by a representative surface marker analysis comparison of cells from the same donor that were activated either with PHA or OKT3 ( shown in Table I ) .
In view of the knowledge that activation-induced genes are regulated by contingent signals arising from the T-cell receptor and protein kinase C ( 23 ) , we then examined 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; -binding protein expression in lymphocytes from normal individuals activated using a combination of OKT3 with the protein kinase C activator PMA .
We found that addition of PMA ( 1 ng/m ! )
to the OKT 3 signal increased the receptor levels .
In fact , activation induced by the combination of OKT3 with PMA led to receptor levels similar to those seen with the polyclonal activator PHA .
A representative experiment from lymphocytes from one normal donor is illustrated in Fig .
4 .
Similar results were seen using lymphocytes from four different individuals .
The results of these experiments collectively indicate that the : ﬁctivation-induced appearance of 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; -binding protein-in lymphocytes is not an all or nothing phenomenon , neither'is it a mere consequence of a general increase in total DNA synthesis .
Instead , expression of the binding protein appears to be regulated by distinct and specific signals arising from the T-cell receptor and the protein kinase C activation pathway .
Effects of Distinct Activation Signals on the Ability of the 1,25- ( OH ) ; [ °HJ ] D ; , Receptor Complex to Bind DNA-Cellulose-In addition to comparing signal-dependent differences in the concentration of the receptor , we investigated whether the different activation signals may lead to the expression of qualitatively different protein ( Fig .
5 ) .

Comparison of the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; binding ( by sucrose density gradient sedimentation ) in PBMC activated with either PHA or OKT3 .
PBMC from three normal subjects were isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation and the nonadherent subset ( following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C ) was incubated for 72 h either with 2 ug/ml of the lectin PHA ( upper panel ) or with the monoclonal antibody OKT3 1:250 dilution ( lower panel ) .
At the end of activation , cells were washed three times and counted .
Subsequently , equal number of PHA-and OKT3-activated cells ( 45 x 10° , 60 x 10° , 75 x 10° respectively , from three samples ) were incubated intact with 1,25- ( OH ) ; [ °H ] JD ; ( 1 x 10~° M ) in the absence or presence of 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled hormone .
Incubations were carried out for 1 h at room temperature .
After incubation , cells were washed twice with 0.2 % bovine serum albumin-saline and then were resuspended in 0.3 ml of KETD-0.3 .
Cells were sonicated , and the sonicate was centrifuged for 1 h at 105,000 x g to give cytosol fraction .
Cytosols were layered onto 4-24 % sucrose density gradients , and the gradients were centrifuged for 19 h at 135,000 x g. Fractions ( 20 x 0.2 ml ) were collected , and aliquots were counted for radioactivity .
Solid circles indicate 1,25- ( OH ) ; [ °HJD ; binding alone ; open circles indicate 1,25- ( OH ) ; [ °H ] D ; binding in the presence of 200-fold excess of unlabeled 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; .
Arrows indicate the position of sedimentation markers .
C = chymotrypsinogen ( s = 2.55 ) ; o = ovalbumin ( s = 8.75 ) .
shown in panels B and C , aliquots from the same sample of PBMC from normal donor were activated either with PHA or OKT3 , and the 1,25- ( OH ) ; [ °H ] D ; binding was analyzed by DNA -cellulose chromatography .
To eliminate potential artifacts due to the relatively lower expression of the binding protein in the OKT3 system , we utilized three times as many cells from the OKT3-activated preparations as compared to the PHA-activated preparations .
For comparison for these experiments , DNA-cellulose chromatography of 1,25- ( OH ) , [ °H ] JD ; binding was performed using resting cells and the profile is illustrated in panel A .
The 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; -binding protein from PHA-activated lymphocytes bound to DNA-cellulose , and during a 0.15-0.6 M KCl gradient a peak was eluted from this affinity resin at 0.28 M KCI .
This behavior is indistinguishable from that of the vitamin D receptor of the classical target tissues of the hormone ( 31 ) .
In contrast , the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; -binding protein from OKT3-activated lymphocytes displayed an altered binding profile to DNA lose with no appreciable binding peak being eluted during the KCl gradient .
These results were reproduced using samples from five different normal donors ( data not shown ) .
The apparent lack of binding protein eluting at 0.28 M KCl in cytosol from three times as many OKT3 as compared to PHA-activated lymphocytes indicated that the difference in the receptor profile could not be accounted by differences in the quantity of the binding protein .
Prompted by the evidence for the ability of PMA to increase the level of 1,25- ( OH ) ; [ °HJD ; binding in OKT3-activated cells , the possibility that the combination of PMA with OKT3 might restore the ability of the binding protein to interact with DNA was investigated .
As seen in panel D the combination of the two stimuli did not change the DNA-binding profile and hence the ability of the steroid receptor complex to interact with DNA-cellulose .
In view of this , we proceeded to test the possibility that the apparent difference in DNA-cellulose binding could be due to altered ionic charges of the protein in the OKT3 activation system , using chromatography with an alternative binding resin , namely DEAE-cellulose ( Fig .
6 ) .
Unlike the case with DNA-cellulose , the binding protein from OKT3-activated cells bound to DEAE-cellulose equally well to the binding protein from PHA-activated cells , suggesting that altered ionic changes could not account for the inability of the receptor from the OKT3 activation system to interact with DNA-cellulose .
Characterization of the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; , Receptor-like Binding Protein by Immunoblots and Partial DNA Sequencing-In spite of the fact that numerous studies have independently confirmed the presence of a receptor-like binding protein for 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; in activated lymphocytes , characterization of this protein has been limited to means afforded by ligand binding methodology .
To gain additional information on this protein , we employed immunoblotting analysis of crude cytosol preparation from lymphocytes with a monoclonal antibody raised against chick intestinal vitamin D receptor ( 26 ) .
As shown in Fig .
7 , a cross-reacting protein with an electro-phoretic mobility of approximately 50 kDa was seen in cytosol preparations from both PHA- or OKT3-activated lymphocytes .
This protein was absent in cytosol from nonstimulated lymphocytes .
The 50-kDa protein from the activated lymphocytes comigrated with recombinant human intestinal receptor prepared from COS cells that had been transfected with a plasmid carrying the receptor cDNA .
In experiments not shown here , the 50-kDa protein from activated lymphocytes was also identified in Western blot analysis using an alternative monoclonal antibody ( IVGSC11 ) provided to us by Dr. H. DeLuca ( University of Wisconsin , Madison , WI ) .
These data suggest strongly that the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; -binding protein from the activated lymphocytes is identical to the protein 7592 f 3000 1.2 5 PHA C. 5 1.0 a E , 10° OKT ; o 0.8 g o o LL 0 0.5 10 15 é o6 { Total [ 9H11,25 ( 0H ) 20 ’ ( 10'°u ) 3 fed © 94 } 0.2 { -| 1 0 10 20 Bound [ °HJ 1,25 ( OH ) , D , ( f moles / 0.16mg Cytosol ) Fig .

Scatchard analysis of specific 1,25- ( OH ) , [ °HIJD : binding in PHA- and OKT3-activated PBMC cytosol .
PBMC from a normal donor were isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation and activated for 72 h either with the lectin PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) or the monoclonal antibody OKT3 ( 1:250 ) .
At the end of activation , cells were washed and counted .
Cytosol from PHA- and OKT3-activated cells ( 170 x 10° ) were obtained by sonication and ultracen-trifugation ( 1 h at 105,000 x g ) .
Aliquots of cytosol ( 1.6 mg of protein/ ml ) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 1,25- ( OH ) ; [ °H ] D ; ( 1 x 10~ `` -1.5 x 10~ M ) alone and in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; overnight at 4°C .

Specific binding from PHA-activated ( open circles ) and OKT3-activated ( open triangles ) , derived by subtracting nonspecific from total binding , was used to generate the Scatchard plots .
expressed constitutively in human intestinal epithelium cells .
Further , the immunoblot data confirm the evidence from the binding studies and demonstrate for the first time directly and independently of binding that the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor protein is absent from resting human peripheral blood lym-phocytes ; but it is expressed following the reception of external stimulatory signals .
Finally , to corroborate the evidence from the immunoblots that lymphocytes express the classical 50-kDa human vitamin D receptor , RNA from activated cells was extracted , and cDNA was synthesized with reverse transcriptase .
The cDNA was then amplified using primers that flank the DNA-binding domain of the human intestinal receptor .
After symmetric amplification , single-stranded DNA was generated using asymmetric amplification and was sequenced by the dideox-ynucleotide chain-termination method .
As shown in Fig .
8 , the amplified sequence from the activated cells had an exact homology with the 195-base pair DNA-binding domain of the human intestinal receptor .
Identical sequences were found when lymphocytes were activated by PHA or OKT3 .
This evidence indicates that the vitamin D receptor protein in lymphocytes is encoded by an mRNA species that is similar if not identical to that expressed in the classical target issues of the hormone .

Time course of the expression of 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptors in PHA- and OKT3-stimulated PBMC .
PBMC from a normal donor were isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation and activated with PHA ( O -- O ) and OKT3 antibody ( A -- A ) for up to 4 days .
At various time points , cells were washed , counted , and aliquots of 2 X 10°/0.1 ml were incubated intact in triplicate with 1 x 107° m 1,25- ( OH ) ; [ °H ] D ; alone or in the presence of 200-fold excess of unlabeled 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; for 1 h at 20°C .
After incubation , cells were washed twice with isotonic buffer supplemented with bovine serum albumin ( 2 mg/ml ) and solubilized with Protosol .
The internalized radioactivity was counted , and specific binding ( total minus nonspecific ) was plotted .
The rate of DNA synthesis ( PHA activated , shaded bar ; OKT3 activated , open bar ) at each indicated time point was also determined by pulsing cell aliquots with for the last 19 h of activation ( inset ) .

At the end of incubation , cells were collected and counted .
Cell aliquots ( 1 x 10° ) were then washed in PBS with 1 % sodium azide and 1 % BSA and then stained with monoclonal antibodies ( Anti-leu-3a { CD4 ] and anti-leu-2a [ CD8 ] ) directly conjugated with fluorescein and phycoerythrin for 30 min at 4°C .

Our results indicate that in lymphocytes activated with the OKT3 monoclonal antibody which mediates only a subset of intracellular events , fewer binding sites are expressed as compared to lymphocytes activated with the mitogenic lectin PHA , a polyclonal activator capable of eliciting a more complete activation response .
Nevertheless , when the signal of OKT3 was combined with that of a protein kinase C activator ( PMA ) , the concentration of the binding sites increased to levels similar to those produced by the polyclonal activator PHA .
The increase of the concentration of the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor induced by the OKT3 signal by PMA is in line with evidence from other activation-induced genes in lymphocytes The 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; Receptor in Human Lymphocytes 7593 A.

DNA-cellulose chromatography of 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor isolated from resting , PHA- , OKT3- , or OKT3 + PMA -activated lymphocytes .
PBMC from a normal donor were isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation and incubated for 72 h either without any additions ( panel A ) or with 2 ug/ml PHA ( panel B ) , OKT3 ( 1:250 dilution ) ( panel C ) , or OKT3 + PMA ( 1 ng/ml ) ( panel D ) .
At the end of the 72-h incubation , cells were washed and counted .
Cell aliquots ( 116 x 10° from resting cells , 43 x 10° from PHA-activated , 132 x 10° from OKT3-activated , 204 x 10° from OKT3 + PMA-activated ) were incubated intact with 1,25- ( OH ) ; ( °HIJD ; ( 2 x 10~° M ) for 1 h at 20 °C , and then cytosols were obtained after sonication and ultracentrifugation .
Proteins were then precipitated with ammonium sulfate ( 40 % of saturation ) for 30 min , resolubilized , and then applied to DNA-cellulose column .
The columns were washed with 30 ml of buffer containing no KCI , 30 ml of buffer containing 0.15 M KCI followed by a 90-ml linear gradient of KCI ( 0.15-0.6 M ) .
Fractions ( 3 ml ) were collected and aliquots were counted for tritium ( @ -- ® @ ) .
Salt concentrations ( - - - ) were monitored by conductivity measurements .
Arrow indicates salt concentrations at which the major peak was eluted .
and supports the contention that the expression of this receptor in lymphocytes in vivo might indeed be under the control of contingent signals including those of the protein kinase C pathway .
Interestingly , an upregulatory effect of the protein kinase C system on the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor has been described recently in endothelial cells ( 32 ) .
The results of the present study also illustrate that the rate of DNA synthesis in lymphocytes is clearly dissociated from the concentration of the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor protein .
This evidence , contrasts with earlier studies by Feldman and colleagues ( 33 ) , who found that 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor expression is a function of DNA synthesis in established osteosarcoma lines .
However , our data are in full agreement with more recent results from the same group indicating that receptor regulation by growth factors is independent of the rate of DNA synthesis ( 34 ) .
In addition to the quantitative differences in the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor , the data of this paper document signal-dependent qualitative differences of the protein as evidenced by the altered behavior of the receptor-1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; complex from OKT3-activated cells during DNA-cellulose chromatography .
This qualitative difference was a consistent finding in lymphocyte preparations from as many as six different normal subjects we have studied .
To exclude the possibility of prote-olytic damage , in three out of the six replicate experiments we added 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to the cytosol buffer which already contained dithiothreitol .
This , however , did not affect the behavior of the receptor from either the PHA- or the OKT3-activated cells .

PBMC from a normal donor were isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation and incubated for 72 h without stimuli or with PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) or OKT3 ( 1:250 ) .
At the end of incubation , cytosols were prepared by sonication and ultracentrifugation .
Aliquots of the cytosol ( containing 100 ug of protein ) and enriched preparation of the human intestinal vitamin D receptor from transfected COS cells ( containing approximately 15 fmole of receptor ) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose .
The membrane was incubated with PBS containing 1 % bovine serum albumin , 2 ug/ml 9A7y monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C .
Following washing with TBS with 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 , the membrane was incubated with 1 % BSA-PBS containing the secondary antibody ( rabbit anti-rat IgG , 1:2,000 dilution of 1 mg/ml ) overnight at 4 °C .
The nitrocellulose was rewashed and then incubated with radioiodinated protein A for 3 h at 22 °C .

had lost partial DNA binding , did not differ between OKT3-and PHA -activated cells .
This rules out the possibility that the difference was due to coincidental variability of the receptor protein in different individuals or random experimental artifacts .
It is equally unlikely that the `` altered `` DNA binding ability of the receptor-ligand complex from cells activated via the partial signal of OKT3 was due to altered ionic charges as evidenced by the demonstration of the ability of the complex to bind DEAE-cellulose .
Finally , the evidence for identical sequence of the DNA-binding domain of the receptor in OKT3- and PHA -activated cells argues against the possibility that the difference could be due to alternative mRNAs expressed in response to different signals .
We currently can not provide a mechanistic explanation of this observation .
Nevertheless , recent evidence that phosphorylation of the 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; receptor might play a significant role in its ability to interact with DNA ( 35 ) , raises the possibility that the qualitative differences seen in our studies might reflect differences in the phosphorylation of the protein .

Comparison of the known sequence of the DNA-binding domain of human intestinal receptor with receptor from activated PBMC .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation and activated with PHA ( 2 ug/ml ) for 24 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated from activated cells using the guanidinium-isothiocyanate method .
Specific oligonucleotide primers A and B ( flanking the 196 bp long region encoding the DNA-binding domain of the human intestinal vitamin D receptor ) for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and primers for sequencing were designed from the published cDNA sequence of human intestinal vitamin D receptor .
Total RNA ( 2-5 ug ) was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and primer B. cDNA was amplified with Tag DNA polymerase and gene-specific primers A and B during 35 cycles on a Perkin-Elmer Cetus PCR DNA Thermocycler .
Single-stranded DNA was generated by performing asymmetric PCR ( ratio of two primers in 50:1 ) and sequenced by the chain termination method using dd NTPs as inhibitors and Sequenase .
Identical sequences were obtained in PBMC activated with OKT3 .
We have found in previous work that unlike PHA-activated cells , lymphocytes activated with OKT3 fail to respond to the antiproliferative effect of 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; ( 3 ) .
Although other possibilities might account for the inability of OKT3-activated lymphocytes to respond to 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; , it is tempting to speculate that this phenomenon might be related to the defective DNA-cellulose binding of the receptor observed here , in the OKT3-activated cells .
Although PMA increased the concentration of binding sites in OKT3-activated cells , we found that combination of PMA with OKT3 failed to restore the ability of the receptor to bind DNA In our previous work ( 14 ) , we used extensively purified lymphocytes , i.e .
fully devoid of monocytes , and activated them using a combination of PHA + PMA .
This combination of stimuli was dictated by the fact that pure T-cells can not be activated in the absence of monocytes unless the monocyte requirement is substituted by phorbol esters or other agents that activate protein kinase C. We found that the concentration of the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor in the mono The 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; Receptor in Human Lymphocytes cyte-depleted lymphocytes was 15-20-fold less as compared to the concentration of the receptor in monocyte-replete preparations of the lymphocytes activated with PHA .
This suggests that for 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor expression in lymphocytes , the monocyte signal is more complex than protein kinase C activation by the phorbol ester .
Considering this , the finding for the inability of PMA to restore DNA binding of the receptor in OKT3-activated cells , could be due to bypassing monocyte-derived signals which may post-transla-tionally influence the protein and thus its DNA binding .
In addition to investigating the signal requirements for 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; binding in activated lymphocytes , we have characterized the induced binding protein using Western blot analysis and DNA sequencing .
The data presented establish that the protein and the mRNA encoding it are identical to those found earlier in the classical target tissues of the hormone .
Moreover , the results of the immunoblots strongly support a de novo expression of the receptor protein following lymphocyte activation .
To our knowledge , such de novo expression of this receptor is unique to lymphocytes since in all other known target cells of the hormone , the receptor is constitutively expressed .
Although not proven , the phenomenon of the expression of the protein upon activation is more likely due to transcriptional activation of the receptor gene .
This would suggest , in turn , that the gene in resting lymphocytes is repressed and that activation signals act to derepress it .
Direct investigation of this will of course require isolation of the gene promoter and identification of its regulatory elements .
We believe , however , that the studies presented here pave the way for such investigations and that the demonstration of the direct link between activation pathways and vitamin D receptor expression illustrates that lymphocytes are ideal models for such studies .
In summary , the present study provides evidence to suggest that activation of lymphocytes leads to the expression of the classical vitamin D receptor and that the expression of this protein in lymphocytes is probably regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level by contingent signals arising from the T-cell antigen receptor , the protein kinase C pathway , and perhaps monocyte-derived intercellular media-tors .
