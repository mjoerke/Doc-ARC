Meijer*® BMI-1 and EZH2 Polycomb-group ( PcG ) proteins belong to two distinct protein complexes involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis .
Using unique PeG-specific antisera and triple immunofluorescence , we found that mature resting peripheral T cells expressed BMI-1 , whereas dividing blasts were EZH2* .
By contrast , subcapsular immature double-negative ( DN ) ( CD4~/CD8~ ) T cells in the thymus coexpressed BMI-1 and EZH2 or were BMI-1 single positive .
Their descendants , double-positive ( DP ; CD4*/CD8* ) cortical thymocytes , expressed EZH2 without BMI-1 .
Most EZH2* DN and DP thymocytes were dividing , while DN BMI-1*/EZH2~ thymocytes were resting and proliferation was occasionally noted in DN BMI-1*/EZH2 * cells .
Maturation of DP cortical thymocytes to single-positive ( CD4*/CD8~ or CD8*/CD4~ ) medullar thymocytes correlated with decreased detectability of EZH2 and continued relative absence of BMI-1 .
Our data show that BMI-1 and EZH2 expression in mature peripheral T cells is mutually exclusive and linked to proliferation status , and that this pattern is not yet established in thymocytes of the cortex and medulla .
T cell stage-specific PcG expression profiles suggest that PcG genes contribute to regulation of T cell differentiation .
They probably reflect stabilization of cell type-specific gene expression and irreversibility of lineage choice .
The difference in PcG expression between medullar thymocytes and mature interfollicular T cells indicates that additional maturation processes occur after thymocyte transportation from the thymus .

This process is regulated both by extracellular and intracellular proteins , including cytokines and transcription factors ( 1-6 ) .
Recent studies identified Polycomb-group ( PcG ) proteins as a new class of transcription regulators that contribute to regulation of hematopoiesis and the cell cycle ( 7-18 ) .
PcG genes were originally discovered in Drosophila as suppressors of homeobox gene expression .
They form a cellular memory system that ensures stable transmission of developmental decisions and cell identity ( 19-22 ) .
PcG proteins form large multimeric protein complexes that bind to DNA and probably function by altering the conformation of chromatin ( 23-32 ) .
Two distinct complexes were identified in humans ( reviewed in Ref .
22 ) .
One complex consists of the BMI-1 , RING1 , HPH1 , HPH2 , HPC1 , HPC2 , and HPC3 PcG proteins and the C-terminal binding protein CtBP ( 23-26 , 28-31 , 33 ) .
A second complex contains the ENX/EZH2 and EED PcG proteins , the HDAC1/2 histone deacetylases , and the YY1 transcription factor ( 32 , 34-36 ) .
The two PcG protein complexes differ in tissue distribution and probably regulate different target genes ( 22 , 37 , 38 ) .

Copyright © 2001 by The American Association of Immunologists Differentiation of lymphocyte precursors in bone marrow is associated with profound alterations in PeG gene transcription ( 10 ) .
The earliest precursor cells preferentially transcribe the BMI-1 PcG gene , and transcription of other PcG genes occurs at later stages of B cell development while transcription of BMI-1 gradually disappears ( 10 ) .
The most convincing evidence to support a role for PcG genes in lymphopoiesis , however , comes from studies of mutant mice .
For instance , overexpression of the Bmi-1 PcG gene in transgenic mice resulted in enhanced lymphoproliferation and ultimately in development of B cell lymphomas ( 13 , 39 ) .
By contrast , mice with a targeted deletion of the Bmi-1 and Mel-18 PcG genes develop severe hypoplasia , while loss of the Eed PcG gene results in increased lymphoproliferation ( 7 , 8 , 11 ) .
These observations suggest that the two PcG complexes have opposing roles in the regulation of hematopoiesis .
We recently demonstrated that expression of the two PcG complexes , reflected by detection of BMI-1 and RING1 , and EZH2 and EED , is mutually exclusive at different B cell differentiation stages in germinal centers ( GCs ) ( 15 , 16 ) .
These results showed that expression of PcG genes is strictly regulated during follicular B cell development and suggested a role for PeG proteins in the GC cell reaction .
Despite a role for PcG genes in regulation of lymphocyte development in experimental model systems , little is known about PcG expression during human hematopoiesis .
In the present study , we addressed the question whether defined stages of T cell development are associated with distinct expression patterns of the two human PcG complexes ( identified by the BMI-1 and EZH2 PcG proteins ) .
We performed tricolor immunofluorescence for these proteins in combination with T cell differentiation stage-specific markers in peripheral lymphoid tissue and thymus .
Similar to follicular B cells , BMI-1 and EZH2 expression were mutually exclusive in interfollicular and follicular T cells .
By contrast , developing thymocytes exhibited three PeG expression profiles , including 0022-1767/01/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG 5926 PcG GENE EXPRESSION DURING HUMAN T CELL DIFFERENTIATION BMI-1 */EZH2~ , BMI-1*/EZH2* , and BMI-1~/EZH2* stages .
These patterns correlated with distinct T cell differentiation stages as characterized by detection of CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , TCRaRB , and TCRy8 .
Our results demonstrate that T cell differentiation is associated with discrete expression patterns of the BMI-1- and EZH2-containing PcG complexes and suggest that human PcG genes contribute to regulation of T cell development .
Distinct PeG expression profiles at various T cell differentiation stages probably reflect stabilization of gene expression patterns and may be related to irreversibility of lineage choice .
Materials and Methods Lymph nodes and thymuses were obtained from the surgery room and immediately frozen .
Consecutive sections were cut ( 3 wm ) and fixed in 2 % formaldehyde .
Endogenous peroxidase was inhibited with 1 % H ; 0 ; , diluted in PBS .
Following preincubation with 5 % BSA , primary Abs against BMI-1 and EZH2 ( 32 ) were applied in combination with antisera against one of the following markers ( Table I ) : CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD19 , CD68 , CD86 , Mib-1/Ki-67 , TCRaB , or TCRy8 .
BMI-1 was detected by incubation with goat anti-mouse ( GaM ) IgG ; , `` using the streptavidin-biotin-avidin complex/HRP method and rhodamine/tyramine intensification ( excitation 550 , emission 570 ; red fluorescence ) .
EZH2 was detected by incubation with goat anti-rabbit antiserum coupled to ALEXA ( excitation 495 , emission 519 ; green fluorescence ) .
The other markers were detected by incubating the slides with GaMIgG , *** or `` ° ( depending on the subclass of the primary antiserum and as indicated in Table 1 ) , followed by incubation with Strep* `` © ( streptavidin coupled to allophycocyanin ( excitation 650 , emission 660 ) ; blue fluorescence ) .
Cross-reactivity of the antisera was excluded by appropriate controls , and PcG expression patterns were confirmed in at least three separate experiments on tissues derived from different individuals .
Sections were analyzed with a Leica DMR Confocal LaserScan microscope ( Leica , Deerfield , IL ) .
Images were stored digitally at 1024 dpi and processed using Corel Photo-Paint 8 .
Results Expression of BMI-1 and EZH2 PcG genes in T cell areas of the lymph node As a first step toward definition of BMI-1 and EZH2 expression in human T cells , we analyzed expression of these PcG proteins in mature T cells of the lymph node .
The majority of these cells are situated in the paracortex or interfollicular region , where they can interact with Ag .
Ag-mediated activation results in formation of enlarged lymphoblasts and differentiation into Ag-specific effector cells ( 40 ) .
BMI-1 and EZH2 PcG proteins were chosen as representatives of two different human PcG complexes and were detected in nuclear staining patterns .
Interfollicular cells most frequently expressed BMI-1 and expression of EZH2 was less abundant ( Fig .
1 , A-C ) .
In the majority of cells , detection of BMI-1 and EZH2 was mutually exclusive , and double staining cells ( identified by yellow fluorescence ) were rarely observed .
The BMI-1~* population in Table I. Antisera and detection system cluded CD3 * T cells ( Fig .
1 , A-C , interfollicular region ; D-F , follicular T cells ) , CD19 * B cells ( Fig .
1 , G-1 ) , and CD68 * monocytic/dendritic cells ( Fig .
1 , J-L ) .
EZH2* cells were a diverse population of CD3 ¢ T cells ( dotted arrows in Fig .
1 , A-C , and inset in 1B ) , CD68* monocytic/dendritic cells ( solid arrow in Fig .
1 , J-L and inset in 1K ) , and unidentified cells .
No CD19 */EZH2 * cells were observed in the interfollicular region .
In rare cases , BMI-1/EZH2 coexpression was seen in interfollicular cells .
However , such BMI-1*/EZH2 * cells were CD3~ ( solid arrow in Fig .
1 , A-C and inset in 1C ) and CD19~ ( solid arrows in Fig .
1 , G-I and inset in 1 , H and I ) and did not belong to the T or B cell lineage .
In some instances , BMI-1/EZH2 double-positive ( DP ) cells were associated with CD68* monocytic/dendritic cells ( see for instance the BMI-1*/CD68 * cell in Fig .
1 , J-L , indicated by a solid arrow , which also expresses EZH2 ( inset in Fig .
1 , K and L ) ) .
Since we focused our study on T cell development , these CD3 / BMI-1*/EZH2 * cells were not further investigated .
Expression patterns of BMI-1 and EZH2 in the interfollicular region correlated with the stage of the cells in the cell cycle , as determined by coexpression of the cell proliferation marker ( 41 ) Mib-1/Ki-67 ( blue fluorescence in Fig .
1 , M-O ) .
The majority of interfollicular BMI-1* cells ( red fluorescence in Fig .
1 , M-O ) were resting , because BMI-1 expression rarely overlapped with the blue Mib-1/Ki-67 signal ( Fig .
1 , N and O ) .
By contrast , green fluorescent EZH2 * interfollicular cells ( Fig .
1 , M and O ) coexpressed Mib-1/Ki-67 ( for instance solid arrow in Fig .
1 , M-O ) and were dividing .
Note that this population included the cells that coexpressed BMI-1 and EZH2 ( for instance dotted arrow in Fig .
1 , G-L ) and were CD3 ~/CD19~ ( see earlier ) .
Detection of BMI-1 and EZH2 in GCs confirmed previously determined expression profiles in follicular B cells ( 15 , 16 ) and showed that expression of these proteins is mutually exclusive in the majority of follicular cells ( GC in Fig .
1 , A-C , and detail in Fig .
1 , D-F ) .
Most CD3 * T cells within GCs expressed BMI-1 * at varying levels ( Fig .
1 , E and F ) and rarely expressed EZH2 ( dotted arrows in Fig .
1 , A-C , and inset in 1B ) .
BMI-1/EZH2 staining patterns within CD3 * cells were identical for TCRaB* cells and no differences were noted between CD4* and CD8~* cells ( data not shown ) .
Mib-1/Ki-67 expression in GCs fully overlapped with EZH2 expression ( Fig .
1 , N and O ) and was not observed in BMI-1* follicular lymphocytes ( Fig .
1N and Refs .
15 and 16 ) .
Therefore , the majority of BMI-1* follicular lymphocytes , which includes CD3 * T cells , is resting .
In summary , expression of BMI-1~ and EZH2-containing PcG complexes in interfollicular and follicular T cells is mutually exclusive in the majority of mature CD3* T cells .

BMI-1 and EZH2 expression in human thymus We next questioned whether the mutually exclusive expression of BMI-1 and EZH2 in peripheral interfollicular T cells is already established during T cell differentiation in the thymus .
We determined BMI-1 and EZH2 expression in thymocytes of the subcapsular layer of the thymus , cortex , and medulla ( Figs .
2-4 ) .
These regions correlate with distinct steps in T cell differentiation ( 40 ) .
The majority of thymic progenitors are located in the subcapsular layer , and differentiation of immature thymocytes primarily occurs in the cortex .
The medulla mainly contains mature thymocytes .
By contrast to the abundance of BMI-1 ~* T cells in interfollicular and follicular regions of the lymph node , the vast majority of subcapsular and cortical thymocytes were EZH2 * ( green fluorescence in Fig .
2 , B and C ) .
BMI-1 was infrequently detected ( red fluorescence in Fig .
24 ) , and superimposition of the BMI-1 expression pattern demonstrated three patterns of BMI-1/EZH2 expression : detection of EZH2 in the absence of BMI-1 ( BMI-1~/ FIGURE 2 .

A-F , BMI-1/EZH2 expression in cortex ( Co ) and subcapsular layer ( SCL , A-C ) and cortex and medulla ( Me , D-F .
The vast majority of cortical thymocytes expresses EZH2 ( B , C , E , and F ) whereas BMI-1 is relatively under-represented ( A and D ) .
BMI-1* cells in the subcapsular layer and cortex frequently coexpress EZH2 , producing yellow/orange nuclear fluorescence ( C ) .
Dotted arrows in C identify BMI-1*/EZH2~ cells in the subcapsular layer .
Note that EZH2 appears down-regulated in medullar thymocytes ( E and F ) , whereas BMI-1 does not appear to change ( D ) .

BMI-1*/EZH2* cells are identified by yellow fluorescence ; BMI-1*/Mib-1* cells stain purple .
Note that Mib-1 expression overlaps mainly with EZH2 , particularly in the cortex .
BMI-1/Mib-1* ( purple cells ) belong to the BMI-1*/EZH2 * ( yellow ) subset ( solid arrows ) , but within the BMI-1*/EZH2+* population not all cells are dividing ( dotted arrows ) .

2 , A and C ) , and detection of both proteins in the same nucleus ( BMI-1*/EZH2 * , orange and yellow fluorescent cells in Fig .
2 , B and C , suggesting different expression levels of BMI-1 and EZH2 in DP cells ) .
The most abundant group of thymocytes were BMI-1~/EZH2 * and were found throughout the cortex ( Fig .
2 , B and C ) .
BMI-1*/EZH2 * thymocytes were present at a lower frequency ( yellow and orange fluorescence in Fig .
2 , B and C ) .
These cells were most abundant in the subcapsular layer , but were observed throughout the cortex ( Fig .
2C ) .
Subcapsular BMI-1 */ EZH2* cells were larger than cortical BMI-1~/EZH2* cells .
BMI-1 */EZH2~ cells were the least abundant of cortical thymocytes .
Most of the BMI-1~/EZH2~ cells with large nuclei were CD68 * macrophages ( data not shown ) , but rare BMI-1 */EZH2~ cells with small nuclei could be detected in the subcapsular layer ( dotted arrows in Fig .
2C ) .
Thymocytes in the medulla had a different expression pattern of BMI-1 and EZH2 as compared with thymocytes in the cortex .
Whereas expression of BMI-1 was low in both cortex and medulla 6107 '01 Kep uo Aq jounwuwt [ 'mmm// : dyy wos ; papeofumog The Journal of Immunology ( red fluorescence in Fig .
2D ) , the intensity of EZH2 staining was less intense in medullar thymocytes than in cortical thymocytes ( green fluorescence in Fig .
2 , E and F ) .
Occasional cells were observed in the medulla that coexpressed BMI-1 and EZH2 at low levels ( solid arrows in Fig .
2 , D-F ) .
Combined analysis of BMI-1 , EZH2 , and Mib-1/Ki-67 demonstrated that the three patterns of BMI-1 and EZH2 expression correlated with different stages in the cell cycle .
The majority of BMI-1~/EZH2* cells in the cortex were in cycle because they coexpressed Mib-1/Ki-67 ( identified by a combination of green ( EZH2 ) and blue fluorescence ( Mib-1/Ki-67 ) in Fig .
2 , G-L ) .
However , the overlap between EZH2 and Mib-1/Ki-67 was not complete , suggesting that not all cortical EZH2 * thymocytes were dividing ( green fluorescent cells in Fig .
27 that lack Mib-1/Ki-67 expression ) .
The staining pattern for BMI-1 and Mib-1/Ki-67 ( red and blue signal in Fig .
2 , H and K , respectively ) showed that most cortical BMI-1 * cells were resting and did not express Mib-1/Ki-67 .
This is best illustrated by detection of red fluorescent ( BMI-1* ) cells in Fig .
2 , H and I and K and L , which lack blue ( Mib-1/Ki-67 ) fluorescence .
However , occasional dividing BMI-1* cells could be observed , as indicated by the presence of purple staining cells in Fig .
2 , H and K ( a combination of the red and blue signal for BMI-1 and Mib-1/Ki-67 , respectively ) .
Such cells always belonged to the BMI-1*/EZH2* fraction ( solid arrows in Fig .
2 , G-L ) , but not all BMI-1*/EZH2 * cells were in cycle because some of them were clearly Mib-1/Ki-67~ ( dotted arrow in Fig .
2 , G-I ) .
We did not observe Mib-1/Ki-67 expression in cortical BMI-1*/EZH2~ cells , suggesting that these cells are resting ( for instance , * in Fig .
2 , G-I ) .
Finally , detection of Mib-1/Ki-67 was infrequent in the medulla and mainly associated with BMI-1~/EZH2 * cells ( Fig .
1 , J-L ) .
Notably , BMI-1*/EZH2 * cells in the medulla did not express Mib-1/Ki-67 .
BMI-1¢*/EZH2~ and BMI-1*/EZH2* thymocytes have an immature phenotype Because lymphocytes with strong coexpression of BMI-1 and EZH2 were less abundant than BMI-1~/EZH2 * cells , larger , and most prevalent in the subcapsular layer and the cortex of the thymus , they possibly represented thymocyte precursors .
BMI-1 */ EZH2 ~ cells , mostly detected in the subcapsular layer , could also belong to this precursor population .
Thymocyte subpopulations can be roughly divided using four cell surface molecules ( 40 ) : CD3 and TCRaB ( both belonging to the TCR complex ) and CD4 and CD8 .
The most immature T cell-committed thymocytes express CD3 at low levels and are CD4~/CD8~ ( double negative , DN ) and TCRaB_ .
The onset of rearrangement at the TCRB locus and the decision to become an « B or a y8 T cell occur in this population , which also encompasses cells that still have the capacity to form NK or B cells ( 6 , 40 , 42-44 ) .
These cells differentiate to a CD4*/CD8* ( DP ) TCRaB* stage in the cortex ( 40 ) , which generally have rearranged TCRB genes and are in the process of TCRA recombination .
Upon expression of the TCRafB chain , they become subject to positive selection before entering the medulla ( 45 ) .
Here , they give rise to CD4 */CD8~ and CD4~-/CD8 * ( single positive , SP ) TCRaB* cells , which are the target of negative selection ( 46 ) before they leave the thymus and seed to the periphery .
To better correlate BMI-1 and EZH2 expression profiles with different stages of T cell development , we performed triple staining for BMI-1 and EZH2 in combination with CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , and TCRaB ( Fig .
3 ) .
Membrane expression of CD3 ( blue fluorescence in Fig .
3 , B and C ) was detected in most cortical BMI-1* thymocytes ( red fluorescence in Fig .
3 , A and C ) and all cortical EZH2* thymocytes ( green fluorescence in Fig .
3 , A and C ) .
Superimposition of 5929 the BMI-1 , EZH2 and CD3 signals demonstrated that CD3 expression occurred in BMI-1~/EZH2* and BMI-1~/EZH2* thymocytes ( green and yellow cells in Fig .
3 , A and C ) , and BMI-1 */ EZH2~ thymocytes with a small nucleus ( red fluorescent cell indicated by * in Fig .
3C ) .
This indicated that cells committed to T cell differentiation express BMI-1 and EZH2 in all three patterns .
To further define the CD3 * thymocyte population in DN , DP .
, and SP subsets , we analyzed BMI-1 and EZH2 expression in combination with CD4 and CD8 .
The CD4 expression pattern is shown in Fig .
3 , D-F .
It shows that CD4 expression ( the blue signal ) is associated with EZH2-expressing cells ( green signal in Fig .
3 , D and F ) but rarely with BMI-1 ~* cells ( red signal in Fig .
3 , D-F ) .
This is best illustrated by subcapsular BMI-1 * cells in Fig .
3K , which are clearly CD4~ ( a detail of BMI-1*/CD4~ cells is shown in the inset of 3E , and the combination with the EZH2 signal in the inset of 3F ) .
We obtained identical results with immunostaining for CD8 ( Fig .
3 , G-I ) : detection of CD8 ( blue signal in Fig .
3 , H and 7 ) was primarily associated with EZH2 * cells ( green signal in Fig .
3 , G and I ) , whereas red fluorescent BMI-1* cells in the subcapsular layer did not stain for CD8 ( Fig .
3H and insets in H and 7 ) .
We concluded that BMI-1~/EZH2* cells , the major population in the cortex , expressed both CD4 and CD8 and therefore corresponds with DP thymocytes .
By contrast , BMI-1*/EZH2* cells and BMI-1*/EZH2~ cells were generally CD4~/CD8~ and belong to the DN stage of T cell differentiation .
This conclusion is further supported by analysis of TCRaRB expression in combination with BMI-1 and EZH2 ( Fig .
3 , J-L ) .
Membrane staining of TCRaPB ( the blue signal ) was primarily associated with EZH2 * ( green fluorescent ) thymocytes ( Fig .
3 , J-L ) .
By contrast , the majority of BMI-1 * ( red fluorescent ) thymocytes were TCRaB_- ( Fig .
3K and inset ) .
The presence of TCRaB within many EZH2*/BMI-1~ thymocytes is consistent with successful completion of TCRB and TCRA gene rearrangement in this thymocyte population .
However , the fact that not all EZH2 */BMI-1~ thymocytes express TCRaRB suggests that some of these cells are still in the process of recombination .
Similarly , the absence of TCRaB on the majority of BMI-1 */EZH2~ and BMI-1 */EZH2 * cells ( Fig .
3 , K , L , and insets ) suggests that they represent a less advanced stage of differentiation than TCRa « B*/EZH2 */BMI-1~ cells .
Using triple staining for BMI-1 , EZH2 , and TCRy8 ( Fig .
3 , M-O ) , we determined that a minority of TCRaB_- cells was TCRy8* .
TCRy8 expression was occasionally detected in cortex and medulla , and only observed in EZH2* cells that did not express BMI-1 .
This demonstrated that these cells have concluded TCRGV and TCRDV rearrangement successfully , and represent more mature stages than BMI-1~/EZH2~ or BMI-1*/EZH2* thymocytes .
BMI-1 and EZH2 expression in SP thymocytes of the medulla We found earlier that the transition between cortex and medulla is associated with a lower intensity of EZH2 staining ( Fig .
4 , A and D ) and decreased detection of Mib-1/Ki-67 .
In the medulla , expression of CD4 and CD8 is separated and fully mature SP thymocytes leave the thymus at the corticomedullary junction ( 40 ) .
Analysis of CD4 expression ( blue fluorescence in Fig .
4 , A-C ) showed that the majority of CD4 * medullar thymocytes expressed EZH2 at a low level ( Fig .
4 , A-C ) , whereas BMI-1 was infrequently detected in this population ( Fig .
4B ) .
Likewise , CD8 * medullar thymocytes ( blue fluorescence in Fig .

stands in sharp contrast to the abundance of BMI-1 expression in peripheral T cells .
Discussion Development of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells into mature lymphocytes follows a complex pathway of differentiation that is regulated by internal and external factors ( 1-6 ) .
Each differentiation step is accompanied by expression of specific transcription factors which regulate formation of various lymphoid lineages and determine their identity .
This identity must be maintained during cell division to ensure a functional immune system , but how cell type-specific gene expression patterns are propagated to the daughter cells is unclear .
Developmental biology identified PcG genes as essential regulators of embryogenesis ( for reviews , see Refs .
19-22 ) .
They determine commitment of cells to patterns of differentiation and contribute to maintenance of cellular identity during cell division .
Recent studies suggested that PcG genes have a similar role during lymphoid differentiation and maturation .
PcG proteins form multimeric protein complexes that bind and modify chromatin ( 23-32 ) .
The two human PcG complexes , identified by the presence of the BMI-1 or EZH2 PcG protein ( 23-26 , 28-34 , 36 ) , are expressed in a mutually exclusive pattern in follicular B cells ( 15 , 16 ) .
In the current study , we found that the majority of interfollicular T cells express BMI-1 and EZH2 in a pattern similar to that of follicular B cells .
Most of these T cells are BMI-1*/EZH2~ and resting ( Mib-1/Ki-67~ ) , whereas dividing wo ; 6107 'O1 Aepy uo 1san8 Aq The Journal of Immunology FIGURE 4 .

Original magnification , X400 .
Mib-1/Ki-67+* T cell blasts are EZH2 * in the absence of BMI-1 .
Similarly , BMI-1 was detected in Mib-1/Ki-67~ follicular T cells while EZH2 was not .
These PcG expression patterns collectively suggest that BMI-1 and EZH2 expression is strictly regulated in both T and B cells .
This may reflect a difference in target genes of the two PcG complexes .
In addition , the absence of BMI-1 in cycling cells is probably related to the observation that chromatin association of the BMI-1-containing PcG complex is cell cycle dependent , because BMI-1 dissociates from chromosomes during the late S-G , -M phase of cell division ( 47 ) .
Suppression of the BMI-1 gene in knockout mice resulted in inhibition of cell prolif-eration , whereas the absence of EED ( belonging to the EZH2-containing complex ) correlated with increased proliferation ( 11 ) .
These results suggest that normal regulation of cell division depends on a balance between the BMI-1- and EZH2-containing PcG complex .
The mutually exclusive expression pattern of BMI-1 and EZH2 in peripheral mature T cells is not immediately established in T cell precursors and different differentiation stages of thymocytes correlated with distinct BMI-1 and EZH2 expression profiles ( summarized in Fig .
5 ) .
We showed that DN cells in the subcapsular layer and cortex coexpress BMI-1 and EZH2 .
In addition , a minor population of DN cells expressed the BMI-1 gene in the absence of EZH2 .
The two BMI/EZH2 expression patterns suggest different silencing patterns of PcG target genes and may reflect the heterogeneity of the DN thymocyte population .
It is unclear whether BMI-1~/EZH2~ and BMI-1*/EZH2 * DN cells represent two separate lineages or whether one originates from the other .
However , the frequent detection of CD3 in both populations suggests that each contains T cell-committed precursors .
We theorize that subcapsular resting cells , which express BMI-1 in the absence of EZH2 , precede BMI-1*/EZH2 * thymocytes .
This sequence of events is supported by RT-PCR experiments on purified CD34 * human bone marrow cells , which showed that the most primitive long-term culture-initiating cells contain the highest level of BMI-1 transcripts and the lowest level of EZH2 transcripts ( 10 ) .
In more mature populations , expression of EZH2 progressively increased while BMI-1 transcripts decreased to being minimal in CD34~ cells .
If PcG expression follows a similar pattern during differentiation of DN thymocyte precursors , CD3*/BMI-1*/ EZH2~ DN cells may be the precursors of the CD3 */BMI-1 */ EZH2* DN stage .
The known steps of T cell differentiation and Co 5931 B Co Me E Me Co reactivity with Mib-1/Ki-6 allow us to speculate further about a possible relationship between BMI-1/EZH2 expression and TCR gene rearrangement status .
Proliferation in developing thymocytes is induced after TCR B-chain expression in the pre-TCR complex ( 48 ) , and detection of Mib-1/Ki-67 expression in BMI-1 */EZH2 * DN/TCRaB_ thymocytes suggests that these cells have completed rearrangement of the TCRB locus .
Since these cells are TCRaB , rearrangement of the TCRA genes has not yet occurred or has yet to produce a functional TCRa protein .
In contrast to DN cells , we found that the majority of DP cells express high levels of EZH2 with little or no BMI-1 .
The transition from the DN to DP stage therefore coincides with loss of BMI-1 expression and the continued presence of EZH2 .
This change in PcG expression probably means that different gene silencing patterns are established in thymocytes that differentiate from the DN to the DP stage .
Most of these cells are and the absence of BMI-1 in these cycling cells resembles the situation in mature peripheral T cells where Mib-1/Ki-67 and BMI-1 expression are separated .
However , the presence of Mib-1/Ki-67 in a subpopulation of BMI-1*/EZH2* DN cells shows that proliferation starts before the appearance of CD4 and CD8 and loss of BMI-1 expression ( possibly related to expression of the TCR -chain ) .
Most DP EZH2*/BMI-1~ cells expressed TCRaRB and have completed recombination of the TCRA and TCRB Ag receptor genes .
A minority of BMI-1~/EZH2 * DP cells was TCRaRB-and probably represent cells that failed to generate a functional TCRafB gene or are still in the process of recombination .
This subset also included a low number of TCRy8* T cells .
The final phase of thymocyte development is the SP stage , where expression of CD4 and CD8 is separated .
SP cells are primarily located in the medulla and undergo negative selection by clonal deletion ( 40 , 46 ) .
The transition between DP and SP cells correlated with a lowered expression of EZH2 and a continued relative absence of BMI-1 .
This expression pattern is markedly different from that in mature T cells of the lymph node , which preferentially express BMI-1 .
In addition , EZH2 expression in peripheral T cells is associated with cell division ( expression of Mib-1/Ki-67 ) , whereas most medullar EZH2* thymocytes are resting and Mib-1/Ki-67~ .
This demonstrates that the BMI-1/EZH2 expression pattern of mature peripheral T cells is not yet established in medullar SP thymocytes , and suggests that these cells have not 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG 5932 PcG GENE EXPRESSION DURING HUMAN T CELL DIFFERENTIATION SCZ on ) 4 CORTEX MEDULLA _- @ - .

Model of BMI-1 and EZH2 PcG gene expression during human T cell differentiation .
Most cortical DN ( CD4~/CD8~ ) thymocyte precursors coexpress BMI-1 and EZH2 , although a small subset of DN cells is BMI-1*/EZH2~ .
These cells mainly reside in the subcortical zone ( SCZ ) and possibly precede the BMI-1*/EZH2* stage .
The majority of these DN cells are resting ( Mib-1~ ) .
During transition to the DP stage , BMI-1 expression is lost while TCRaRB or TCRy8 membrane expression occurs .
This coincides with induction of proliferation ( Mib-1* stage ) .
Hypothetically , rare proliferating ( Mib-1 * ) cells within the DN subset could reflect expression of the TCR B-chain in the absence of successful TCRA recombination .
SP cells in the medulla are resting and express EZH2 at a lower level than cortical DP cells .
It is unknown whether the limited number of BMI-1*/EZH2~ medullary T cells reflect precursors to BMI-1*/EZH2~ interfollicular T cells .

fully matured with respect to PeG expression profile .
Recent thymic emigrants are known to further mature in the periphery , as evidenced by acquisition of functional competence and evolution of surface markers ( 49 , 50 ) .
This possibly coincides with the appearance of the PeG expression pattern that is observed in T cells of the lymph nodes .
Alternatively , the few BMI-1*/EZH2~ medullar thymocytes may be the cells that actually leave the thymus , while BMI-1*/EZH2 `` ** `` thymocytes could represent cells that are destined to die .
Experiments in mutant mice convincingly demonstrated that PcG genes encode proteins that are essential for hematopoiesis ( for reviews , see Refs .
18 and 51 ) .
A range of effects on lymphoid tissue of these animals has been observed , including enhanced lymphoid proliferation in BMI-1-transgenic mice and EED knockout mice ( 11 , 39 ) , inhibition of precursor proliferation and severe thymic hypoplasia in BMI-1 and Mel-18 knockout mice ( 7 , 8 , 52 ) , B cell maturation defects ( 53 ) , and development of lymphomas ( 39 , 54 , 55 ) .
Although their role in human lymphopoiesis is un-clear , the distinct patterns of BMI-1/EZH2 expression in DN , DP , and SP thymocytes suggest that PcG genes contribute to the regulation of human T cell development as well .
The most obvious mechanism of regulation is suppression of homeobox gene expression .
Homeobox genes are known to affect lymphopoiesis and select groups of homeobox genes are expressed in various T lymphocyte subsets , while others are suppressed ( 4 , 56-61 ) .
Since PeG proteins contribute to silencing of homeobox genes ( 19-21 ) , it is reasonable to expect that they are involved in this process .
Different PcG expression patterns in distinct lymphocyte subpopulations possibly reflect stage-specific expression of homeobox genes .
Two other candidate proteins for PeG-mediated regulation are Vav and E2F6 .
Vav is a rho family GTP/GDP exchange factor that is involved in regulation of positive and negative selection and Ag receptor-mediated proliferation ( 62-64 ) .
Vav is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells ( 65 ) .
The possibility that EZH2 and Vav affect each other is suggested by the observed interaction between Vav and EZH2 ( 66 ) .
E2F6 is a transcription factor that is preferentially expressed by CD34 * lymphoid precursors and is involved in regulation of apoptosis ( 67 ) .
Similarly , the BMI-1-containing PcG complex is specifically expressed in thymocyte precursors ( this study ) and may be involved in E2F6 function because E2F6 can be part of this PeG complex ( 68 ) .
In conclusion , we demonstrated that expression of the BMI-1-and EZH2-containing PcG complexes in mature T cells is mutually exclusive , and that this pattern is not yet established in differentiating thymocytes .
The various stages of T cell differentiation are associated with profound changes in PeG expression patterns .
This suggests a regulatory role for PcG genes in lymphopoiesis , as previously suggested by PeG knockout mice and PCR assays on lymphoid precursor populations in bone marrow .
The change in PcG expression during T cell development probably reflects stabilization of cell type-specific gene expression patterns and irreversibility of lineage choice .
