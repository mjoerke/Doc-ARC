Immunology 1998 95 264-271 Differential effects of protein kinase C inhibitors on fibronectin-induced interleukin-f gene transcription , protein synthesis and secretion in human monocytic cells J. RITZENTHALER & J. ROMAN Pulmonary & Critical Care Division , Department of Medicine , Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , GA , USA SUMMARY Human monocytic cells express interleukin-1B ( IL-1B ) when stimulated with the extracellular matrix glycoprotein , fibronectin ( FN ) .
Protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation is considered important for this process ; however , the metabolic steps at which PKC acts upon to mediate the FN-induced IL-1B response remain unclear .
We performed an analysis of the mechanisms by which two PKC inhibitors , Calphostin C and Staurosporine , prevent the FN-induced IL-1B response .
Both inhibitors blocked the secretion of IL-1f protein into the media of peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to FN .
Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that under these circumstances , Calphostin C inhibited the production of IL-1fB protein , whereas Staurosporine allowed protein production , but inhibited its secretion .
To determine the mechanisms responsible for these differences , we turned to human U937 promonocytic cells .
U937 cells transfected with the human full-length IL-1 B promoter connected to a luciferase reporter gene were submitted to transcription assays , Northern blotting , and DNA electrophoresis mobility gel shift assays .
These studies revealed that Calphostin C inhibited the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) which is considered necessary for FN induction of IL-1 B gene transcription , and prevented the transcription of the IL-1B gene .
In contrast , Staurosporine alone induced AP-1 translocation and stimulation of the gene .
Overall , our data indicate that Calphostin C prevents the transcription of the IL-1B gene thereby inhibiting protein synthesis .
Based on the high specificity of this compound for PKC , we conclude that PKC is necessary for FN-induced IL-1 B protein production .
In contrast , Staurosporine prevented secretion of IL-1B by unknown mechanisms .
INTRODUCTION Interleukin-16 ( IL-1 B ) is a potent multifunctional polypeptide produced by monocytic cells .
!
This cytokine is expressed soon after tissue injury and is considered important for establishment and maintenance of an effective inflammatory response .
`` ~* Fibronectin ( FN ) , a high molecular weight connective tissue glycoprotein , has been reported to induce IL-1B production in human monocytic cells .
`` © Because it too is highly expressed in injured tissues , FN may induce IL-1f production in vivo which could serve to amplify inflammation . ``
However , the mechanisms by which FN induces IL-1B have not been entirely elucidated .

The known cellular mechanisms mediating the FN-induced IL-1B response are as follows .
Monocytic cells interact with FN by means of a number of cell surface glycoproteins that are members of the integrin receptor family . ``
'' One of these integrins , « 5B1 , is responsible for the induction of IL-1B by FN .
*° Once bound by FN , the activated integrin induces nuclear translocation of the trans-acting factor activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) ( a product of the proto-oncogene c-jun ) which is responsible for induction of IL-1B gene transcription and accumulation of IL-1B mRNA ( Roman et a/ .
, unpublished observations ) .
The IL-1B mRNA is then translated into the IL-1B precursor protein ( 31000 MW ) followed by cleavage and secretion of the 17000 MW bioactive The early signalling events that follow FN- « 5B1 binding and lead to increased transcription of the IL-1B gene and secretion of the protein remain poorly understood , but protein kinases are believed to be important . ``
'' One protein kinase linked experimentally to the FN-induced IL-1B response is the serine/threonine kinase protein kinase C ( PKC ) . ``
We set out to explore the metabolic steps in FN-induced IL-1B production that are affected by two commonly used PKC inhibitors : Calphostin C ( CC ) and Stauroporine ( St ) .
©1998 Blackwell Science Ltd Protein kinase C and fibronectin-induced IL-1 $ 265 Calphostin C is a photoactivatable regulatory site inhibitor that competes with endogenous regulators of the kinase and with diacylglycerol , thereby specifically preventing PKC acti-vation .
'* `` * Staurosporine , on the other hand , is a chemically synthesized indolocarbazole derived from fungal metabolites that is not selective for PKC .
This catalytic site inhibitor acts by competing for adenosine triphosphate at the active site of PKC and other kinases .
'* `` MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Fibronectin was isolated from bovine plasma by affinity chromatography using gelatin-sepharose as previously des-cribed . '
'' Preparations of FN were > 99 % pure , as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) .
Calphostin C was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation ( La Jolla , CA ) and Staurosporine was purchased from Sigma Chemical Company ( St Louis , MO ) .
A goat anti-human polyclonal antibody to IL-1B ( ab201 ) was purchased from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN ) .
All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company or Fisher Scientific ( Pittsburgh , PA ) unless otherwise specified .
Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and U937 cells Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were isolated by elutriation on a polysucrose diatrizoate column ( Histopaque 1077 ) under sterile conditions and maintained in RPMI-1640 as previously described . ``
Each experiment was separate and performed at least four times using freshly isolated PBMC from healthy non-smoking volunteers .
Previous studies involving PBMCs have demonstrated that the cell type responsible for the IL-1 B production and activity was the monocyte and that the lymphocytes present did not effect this response.© Therefore , PBMCs were used in the experiments without further purification .
Human monocytic/macrophage cells from histiocytic lym-phoma , U937 ( ATCC CRL no .
1593 ; American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ) were used for studies directed at investigating the effects of the PKC inhibitors on FN-induced IL-1B gene transcription .
U937 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 % antiobiotic-antimycotic ( 100 U/ml penicillin G sodium , 100 U/ral streptomycin sulfate , 0-25 ug/ml amphotericin B ) and incubated in a humidified 5 % CO , incubator at 37° .
Cells were treated at 4x 10° cells per group with soluble lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -free FN ( 100 ug/ml ) for 16 hr in the presence or absence of the PKC inhibitors , unless otherwise specified .
FN was used at 100 ug/ml because this was previously shown to be the concentration needed to maximally stimulate IL-1B production . ``
Cells were pretreated for 30 min with St and CC at 1x 10~ ' m. Post-treatment cell counts on representative samples showed no significant difference in cell number when these agents were used at this concentration ( data not shown ) .
Cells were judged to be > 95 % viable by trypan blue exclusion .
Screening for LPS Strict measures were taken to avoid LPS contamination .
When necessary , experimental reagents were reconstituted in LPS ©1998 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 95 , 264-271 free water ( Sigma ) .
All treatment materials and culture media were screened with a limulus-based endotoxin assay with a sensitivity of 0:06 ng/ml ( Endotect-Schwarz/Mann Biotech , Cleveland , OH ) .
The sensitivity of this screening tool falls within the accepted background levels of other endotoxin assays for LPS . ``
In contaminated samples , LPS was removed by rotation at 4° in B-52 END-X endotoxin-removal devices ( Associates of Cape Cod , Inc. , Woods Hole , MA ) .
Protein concentration was quantitated by absorbance at an optimal density ( OD ) of 280 nm and reassessed for endotoxin contamination .
Proteins treated in this fashion were deemed intact as demonstrated by the absence of molecular weight changes when compared with the original protein on SDS-PAGE , .
IL-1 $ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) Immunoreactive protein present in the supernatant of treated cells was measured using a sandwich ELISA assay for human IL-1 B ( Quantikine , R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions as previously described . ``
Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation analysis of IL-1B in PBMCs Monocytes were isolated by adhesion of PBMCs to plastic culture dishes for 1 hr at 37° .

RESULTS The effects of CC and St on IL- protein secretion in FN-treated PBMCs Using a modified enzyme-linked immunoassay , we investigated the effects of CC and St on the FN-induced IL-1 $ B response .
As previously described , `` `` FN induced the accumulation of IL-1B protein in the supernatants of PBMCs .
This response was consistently inhibited by St and CC when these agents were added prior to FN stimulation ( Fig .
la , b ) .
Inactivated CC did not affect the FN-induced response ( Fig .
1b , FN/CC ) .
W7 ( Fig .
lc ) , a potent inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase , and nifedipine ( not shown ) , a voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker , were unable to block the increased production of IL-1f in response to FN .
Note that , although the amount of IL-1B found in stimulated cells was consistently significantly higher than controls ( P < 0-05 ) , there was variability in the IL-1B response to FN with measured levels ranging from 1500 to over 8000 pg/ml as previously demonstrated . ``
The exact cause for this variability is unknown but suggests different states of responsiveness depending on the source of the cells .
Effects of CC and St on FN-induced IL-1 $ protein synthesis and secretion in PBMC We then evaluated the effects of the two PKC inhibitors on FN-induced IL-16B synthesis and secretion using pulse-chase analysis followed by immunoprecipitation .
Figure 2 shows a representative example of these experiments where cells were pretreated for 30 min with Staurosporine ( St , left panel ) or activated Calphostin C ( CC , right panel ) at 1x 10~ ' m followed by exposure to 100 ug/ml FN for 16 hr .
Cell extracts and supernatants ( Sup ) were immunoprecipated separately with an antibody to IL-1B or with control IgG .

The supernatants were collected and the presence of IL-1B protein ( expressed as pg/ml ) was analysed by enzyme-linked immunoassay .
Results represent at least four independent experiments .
Note that FN induced the accumulation of IL-1B protein in the supernatants of PBMCs when compared with the control .
Both St and CC inhibited this stimulatory effect , whereas inactive CC and W7 did not .
W7 appeared to enhance the response .
material was immunoprecipitated by the control IgG in a sample of cell extract obtained from cells treated with FN ( Cell Extract , FN* , first left lane ) .
The following was found when the anti IL-1 B antibody was used .
No IL-1 B protein was detected in the cell extracts of FN-treated cells in the absence of inhibitors ( Cell Extract , FN ) ; however , both precursor ( 31000 MW ) and active ( 17000 MW ) forms of IL-1B ( the latter being predominant ) were detected in the supernatants of these cells ( Sup , FN ) .
In contrast , cell extracts obtained from cells treated with St prior to exposure to FN showed increased amounts of precursor IL-1B protein ( Cell Extract , FN/St ) , but no IL-1 was detected in their supernatants ( Sup , FN/St ) .
In other words , PBMCs exposed to FN in the absence of inhibitors synthesized and secreted IL-1 B protein with little IL-1B remaining intracellularly at the end of the experiment .

Effects of Staurosporine on IL-1B protein synthesis and secretion .
Isolated PBMCs ( 4 x 10® cells ) were pretreated with Staurosporine ( St ) or activated Calphostin C ( CC ) at 1 x 10~ `` m for 30 min prior to stimulation with or without 100 ug/ml soluble LPS-free FN ( FN ) for 1 hr in the presence of modified complete media .
Cells were incubated an additional 90 min in methionine free media containing FN , PKC inhibitors and supplemented with 100 pCi/ml *S methionine .
Cells were washed , incubated in fresh RPMI-1640 media containing FN and PKC inhibitors for 16 hr and labelled IL-1B from cell extracts or supernatants ( Sup ) were immunoprecipitated with 10 ug/ml of control IgG ( FN* ) or goat-anti human IL-1B antibody using Protein G-coated sepharose beads .
All samples were boiled in SDS-sample buffer , antigen-antibody complexes were separated on an 8 % SDS-PAGE that was vacuum dried and exposed to X-ray film .
No protein was immunoprecipitated by the control IgG in FN-treated cells ( FN* ) .
When cells exposed to FN alone ( FN ) were examined , no IL-1B protein was found in the cell extract , whereas the IL-1B precursor protein ( 31000 MW ) and especially the active protein ( 17000 MW ) were found in the supernatant .
In cells pretreated with St prior to exposure to FN ( FN St ) , increased quantities of IL-1fB precursor protein were found in the cell extract , but no protein was present in the supernatant .
In parallel experiments , cells pretreated with CC prior to exposure to FN ( FN CC ) , showed no IL-1fB protein was detected in the cell extracts or supernatants .
Staurosporine treatment prior to FN exposure resulted in accumulation of the intracellular IL-1 $ B precursor protein , but no detectable levels of precursor or active IL-1 were released into the extracellular medium .
In contrast to St , CC-treated cells did not show intracellular or extracellular IL-1 protein ( right panel ) .
The above results suggest that St and CC inhibit the FN-induced IL-1 B response by different mechanisms of action .
In order to investigate this in more detail , we turned to monocytic U937 cells since they have the intracellular machinery necessary for production of in response to FN ( 23 ; Roman et al .
, unpublished observations ) .
Effects of CC and St on FN induction of IL-16 mRNA in U937 cells FN induced an increase in IL-1B mRNA accumulation in a dose-dependent manner with an increase of almost 20 % with 100 ug/ml FN ( Fig .

Activated CC ©1998 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 95 , 264-271 alone decreased the constitutive expression of the mRNA ( Fig .

It was also able to block the FN-induced accumulation of IL-1B mRNA ( Fig .

Inactive CC , on the other hand , was not able to inhibit the FN-induced response ( Fig .

In contrast , and consistent with the PBMC immunoprecipitation data , IL-1B mRNA accumulation in response to FN took place in the presence of St ( Fig .
3a , lanes 7,8 ; Fig .
3¢c , FN + St ) .
Of note , accumulation of IL-1 mRNA occurred in cells treated with St alone , suggesting a direct stimulatory effect ( Fig .

Northern blot analysis of the GAPDH gene was used to normalize for mRNA sample loading as seen in Fig .

U937 cells were pretreated with Staurosporine ( St , lanes 7 and 8 ) , activated ( CC* , lanes 4 and 6 ) or inactivated ( CC , lane 5 ) Calphostin C at 1 x 10~ `` m for 30 min prior to a 2 hr stimulation with ( 100 ug/ml , lane 2 ; 200 ug/ml ; lanes 3 , 5 , 6 , and 8 ) or without ( lanes 1 , 4 , and 7 ) soluble LPS-free FN .
Total RNA was extracted , electroph-oresed in a 12 % agarose gel containing 22 M formaldehyde and semi-dry transferred onto nylon membrane for 1 hr at 1 mA/cm .
The membrane was probed with radio-labelled IL-1B cDNA at 1-10 x 10° c.p.m./ml at 42° in a hybridization oven for 24 hr , washed with sodium chloride sodium citrate solution ( SSC ) at 55° , and exposed to X-ray film for 24 hr .
( b ) For control , membranes were probed with a radio-labelled GAPDH probe .
( c ) Densitometric scanning was performed using a laser densitometer ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
The relative expression of IL-1B mRNA is depicted as the ratio between the relative densitometric units obtained from Northern blots for IL-1 and GAPDH .
Note that U937s exposed to FN expressed more IL-1B mRNA when compared with the control .
This effect was dose dependent with higher expression seen with 200 ug/ml of FN ( FN 200 ) .
Activated Calphostin C ( CC* ) decreased the constitutive expression of IL-1B mRNA and suppressed the FN induction of the message ( FN+CC* ) , whereas inactive Calphostin C had no effect ( FN+CC ) .
Induction of the IL-1B message was seen when cells were exposed to St alone and this agent did not block the stimulatory effect of FN ( FN + St ) .

Samples were normalized to total protein measured by the Bradford method using Coomassie blue G-250 .
Note that cells stimulated with 100 ug/ml of FN ( FN ) showed increased transcription of the gene when compared with control .
Activated CC had no effect on the transcription of the gene in untreated cells ( CC* ) but inhibited the FN-induced response ( FN+CC* ) .
Inactivated CC had no effect on the stimulatory effect of FN ( FN+CC ) .
Staurosporine alone induced the transcription of the gene ( St ) and did not inhibit the FN-induced response ( FN + St ) .

Staurosporine alone induced the transcription of the IL-1f gene ( Fig .

Effects of CC and St on nuclear translocation of AP-1 We have observed that FN induction of IL-1 gene transcription is associated with nuclear translocation of the trans-acting factor AP-1 ( Roman et al .
, unpublished observations ) .
Thus , we predicted that its effects might be due to inhibition of AP-1 nuclear translocation .
In Fig .

However , increased binding was detected when cells were stimulated with FN ( FN ; Fig .

This effect was prevented by activated CC ( FN/CC* ) ( Fig .

Conversely , St did not inhibit nuclear binding to radio-labelled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide ; instead , it induced AP-1 translocation into the nucleus with ( FN/St ; Fig .

€ 1998 Blackwell Science Ltd , Immunology , 95 , 264 271 DISCUSSION The role of PKC in IL-1B production is well established : ' `` `` * however , the relevance of this pathway in matrix-induced IL-1B expression has only recently been explored ( refs 5 , 6 , 25 , 26 ; for review see 11 ) .
Studies demonstrating the activation of PKC in monocytic cells treated with FN , *° and the inhibition of IL-1B ( as determined by measuring bioactivity ) in cells pretreated with inhibitors of PKC `` did not examine the effects of these reagents on gene expression or protein synthesis and processing .
Thus , the exact step ( s ) at which PKC acts to mediate the FN-induced IL-1 $ response remains unclear .
Herein , it is shown that CC inhibits the transcription of the IL-1B gene in cells exposed to FN .
Inhibition of gene transcription by CC explains the decrease observed in the accumulation of endogenous IL-1B mRNA and the absence of IL-1 B protein observed in PBMCs pretreated with CC prior to exposure to FN .
Because of the recognized specificity of CC for PKC , the data also indicate that PKC acts to stimulate transcription of the IL-1 gene in response to FN .
Although the literature contains little information regarding IL-1B gene transcription in response to FN , our findings regarding PKC and IL-1 B are in line with those of others that have stimulated cells with agents other than FN .
For example , Shapira and associates ( 1994 ) stimulated monocytic cells with LPS and found that H-7 , a PKC and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor , inhibited LPS-induced IL-1 production and concluded that LPS-induction of IL-1B expression requires activation of PKC upstream to gene transcription .
* `` ' Data presented herein suggest that PKC induction by FN is followed by activation and nuclear translocation of AP-1 .
a trans-acting factor known to induce the transcription of the IL-1B gene .
However , it is possible that PKC could mediate the FN-induced IL-1B response via other mechanisms including enhanced phosphorylation of ppl25fak in CHO cells , a tyrosine kinase that may promote signal transduction . ``
'' or phosphorylation of DNA methyltransferase , an enzyme that acts in the nucleus and alters gene expression by changing DNA methylation patterns .
`` ° It is also conceivable that PKC acts on nuclear proteins other than AP-1 ( e.g .
NF-BA ) .
`` ° In contrast to the studies with CC , interpretations based on the results obtained with St are difficult because of studies showing its ability to inhibit PKC activation by non-specific mechanisms and its demonstrated ability to affect other kinases such as PKA .
'* `` This last mechanism , however , is unlikely to be relevant to the FN-induced IL-1B response as it has been demonstrated that FN does not induce cAMP in human monocytes , and that the protein kinase A inhibitor H 89 does not block its stimulatory effect . ``
In our studies , St did not inhibit transcription of the IL-1B gene in transfected U937 cells or the accumulation of endogenous IL-1B mRNA ; nor did it inhibit IL-1B protein synthesis in PBMCs .
Instead , St inhibited the secretion of newly synthesized IL-1B protein as demonstrated in PBMCs .
These conclusions are similar to those by Bakouche et al .
( 1992 ) who examined the effects of St on induction of IL-1B production by LPS in human monocytes . ``
' These investigators demonstrated that free LPS induced translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and that this was followed by production and secretion of IL-lx and IL-1B .
The 270 stimulatory effect of LPS was blocked by co-treatment with St .
In contrast to free LPS , stimulation of cells with LPS presented in multi-lamelar vesicles did not induce PKC translocation or IL-1 secretion , but did induce its production .
Under these conditions , IL-1 production was not affected by St .
The latter observation led the authors to conclude that activation of PKC is necessary for LPS-induced secretion of IL-1 , but not its production .
Using northern blot analysis , Geng et a/ .
( 1993 ) found that herbimycin A blocked LPS induction of IL-1B mRNA , whereas St did not , again suggesting that IL-1B production was not altered by St. `` Differences in the effects of CC and St are likely explained by the differential effects of these agents on proteins other than PKC .
St has been shown to inhibit translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and abolish its activity . ``
'' Thus , its activity as a PKC inhibitor is not ques-tioned .
However , because of its non-specific effects , it is also likely to affect various other processes .
Herein , we show that St can directly cause nuclear translocation of AP-1 , which is followed by IL-1B gene transcription , mRNA accumulation , and protein synthesis .
The mechanisms by which St inhibits the secretion of IL-1 B protein remain unknown .
Secretion of IL-1fB does not follow the normal exocytic pathway . ``
The rate of IL-1B secretion appears affected by the intracellular calcium concentration , ** and proper folding of the mature protein . ``
'' Sequences present within the precursor molecule may prevent secretion by affecting protein conformation .
`` `` `` `` `` ° In view of the above , it is reasonable to postulate that St may act by affecting the processing of the IL-1B precursor protein .
This is supported by the immunoprecipitation experiments presented in this report that showed accumulation of the IL-1B precursor protein , but not the active form .
In summary , we have found that CC blocked the FN-induced production of IL-1B by preventing PKC acti-vation , which in turn inhibited the nuclear translocation of AP-1 , a transcription factor involved in IL-1 B gene transcription .
In contrast , St induced the nuclear translocation of AP-1 , which resulted in an increase in IL-1B gene transcription , mRNA accumulation , and IL-1B protein synthesis .
Although St induced IL-1B production , it prevented IL-1B protein secretion , perhaps by affecting several mechanisms including IL-1 processing .
