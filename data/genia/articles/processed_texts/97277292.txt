This activity requires regions of SLP-76 that mediate protein-protein interactions with other molecules in T cells , suggesting that SLP-76-associated proteins also function to regulate signal trans-duction .
Here we describe the molecular cloning of SLAP-130 , a SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein of 130 kDa .
We demonstrate that SLAP-130 is hematopoietic cell-specific and associates with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 .
Additionally , we show that SLAP-130 is a substrate of the T cell antigen receptor-induced protein tyrosine ki-nases .
Interestingly , we find that in contrast to SLP-76 , overexpression of SLAP-130 diminishes T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of the interleukin-2 promoter in Jurkat T cells and interferes with the augmentation of interleukin-2 promoter activity seen when SLP-76 is overexpressed in these cells .
These data suggest that SLP-76 recruits a negative regulator , SLAP-130 , as well as positive regulators of signal transduction in T cells .

Engagement of the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) results in the activation of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTK ) and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins in T cells ( 1 ) .
Our efforts to characterize substrates of the TCR-induced PTK activity led to the cloning of SLP-76 , a tyrosine-phosphorylated hematopoietic cell-specific protein that associates with the SH3 domains of Grb2 ( 2 , 3 ) .
A possible function of SLP-76 in T cells was suggested by experiments showing that overexpression of SLP-76 augments TCR-mediated signals that lead to the induction of IL-2 gene promoter activity ( 4 , 5 ) .
We have shown that the activity of SLP-76 requires engagement of the TCR and that overexpression of SLP-76 results in increased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade following TCR ligation . ``
Interestingly , three distinct regions of SLP-76 that are responsible for protein-protein interactions in T cells are required for its ability to augment IL-2 promoter activity when overexpressed ( 6 , 7 ) . ``
These data suggest that SLP-76 functions as a link between proteins that regulate signals generated by TCR ligation .
To investigate the function of SLP-76 in T cells further , we and others have begun to characterize SLP-76-associated proteins that may participate with SLP-76 in transducing signals from the TCR to the nucleus .
These proteins include Vav , which associates with the amino-terminal acidic region of SLP-76 in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner ( 5 , 8 , 9 ) ; the adapter protein Grb2 , which interacts with a proline-rich motif of SLP-76 via its SH3 domains ( 3 , 4 ) ; and two unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 64 and 130 kDa and a serine/threonine kinase , all of which associate with the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of SLP-76 ( 4 ) .
In this study , we report the cloning of the cDNA encoding a 130-kDa protein ( SLAP-130 for SLP-76 associated phosphoprotein of 130 kDa ) that associates with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 .
Additionally , we provide evidence that SLAP-130 may function as a negative regulator of TCR signals that activate IL-2 gene transcription .

Additionally , triplicate samples of 5 X 10° unstimulated cells were assayed for B-galactosidase activity using the Galacto-Light Plus Reporter Gene Assay System ( Tropix Inc. , Bedford , MA ) .
Luciferase activity was determined as described previously ( 10 ) .
Luciferase light units were normalized to B-galactosidase activity present in each transfectant to standardize for transfection efficiency .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Cloning of cDNA Encoding SLAP-130-We have shown previously that the SH2 domain of SLP-76 associates with two unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins upon stimulation of Jurkat T cells with either anti-TCR mAb or the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate ( 4 ) .
To facilitate purification of these SLP-76-associated proteins , we established a variant of the Jurkat T cell line , JA¥/SLP-SH2 , which expresses a chimeric surface protein consisting of the extracel-lular and transmembrane domains of the HLA-A2 molecule in frame with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 .
The A2 epitope enabled the isolation of proteins associated with the SLP-76 SH2 domain by immunoprecipitation with anti-A2 mAb .
JA2/SLP-SH2 cells were stimulated with pervanadate for maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer .
Anti-A2 immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane .
A single major species of approximately 130 kDa was excised and subjected to tryptic digestion to generate peptides for protein sequencing .
One peptide se 11675 quence , PPNDVLTK , was represented in an EST clone .
Se quencing this clone revealed an open reading frame of over 1000 bp .
A region of this clone was then used to probe a human thymus Agt10 cDNA library to obtain further sequence .
A cDNA clone containing 370 bp of the EST sequence and an additional 1008 bp of coding sequence 5 ' of the EST was isolated and found to contain a putative start site 27 bases downstream of a stop codon .
A cDNA containing the remaining 3'-coding sequence was amplified from Jurkat cDNA by 3 !
RACE and contained 267 additional bases of coding sequence followed by a stop codon 2349 bases downstream of the putative start .
A contiguous cDNA was generated by RT-PCR amplification of pp130 from Jurkat RNA ( Fig .
1 ) .
This sequence was confirmed by sequencing the product of multiple independent RT-PCR reactions .
We have designated this protein SLAP-130 for SLP-76 associated phosphoprotein of 130 kDa .
The complete open reading frame of SLAP-130 consists of 2349 bp translating to a protein of 783 amino acids with an abundance of proline ( 12 % ) and charged ( 81 % ) residues .
Putative nuclear localization sequences are found within amino acids 480-503 and 683-700 ( Ref .
13 and see Fig .
1 ) .
We do not know yet whether SLAP-130 is present in the nucleus of Jurkat T cells .
There are several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule that may be responsible for the interaction of SLAP-130 with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 .
In addition , there are four tyrosines ( resi-dues 462 , 595 , 651 , and 771 ) present in motifs that may mediate binding to the SH2 domain of sre family kinases ( 14 ) , suggesting that SLAP-130 may interact with proteins other than SLP-76 in T cells .
Tissue Distribution of SLAP-130-Northern blot analysis of human mRNA from multiple tissues was performed to determine the tissue distribution of SLAP-130 ( Fig .
2 ) .
As shown , SLAP-130 mRNA is expressed in hematopoietic tissues ( pe-ripheral blood mononuclear cells , spleen , and thymus ) but not in non-lymphoid tissues .
Additionally , SLAP-130 was amplified as a single product from total Jurkat RNA ( data not shown ) , demonstrating expression in this cell line .
Expression of cDNA Encoding SLAP-130 Results in a Protein That Migrates Similarly to pp130-Translation of the open reading frame of the SLAP-130 cDNA predicts a protein with a molecular mass of 86 kDa .
However , the presence of stop codons flanking both the 5 and 3 ' ends of the putative coding sequence suggested that we had isolated the full-length cDNA encoding a 130-kDa , SLP-76-associated protein .
This was confirmed by generating an epitope ( FLAG ) -tagged version of SLAP-130 cDNA ( pEF/SLAP-130 ) for transient expression in Jurkat T cells .
As shown in Fig .
3A , transfection of Jurkat T cells with pEF/SLAP-130 results in the expression of a protein reactive with anti-FLAG mAb that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa ( Zane 2 ) .
This protein does not appear in lysates of cells transfected with the control vector pEF ( Zane 1 ) .
Whether the apparent migration of SLAP-130 at 130 kDa instead of the predicted 86 kDa results from post-translational modifications or the abundance of charged amino acids present in the molecule is not yet known .
To investigate further whether the protein encoded by the SLAP-130 cDNA is identical to the 130-kDa , SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein , we prepared a GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of SLP-76 ( GST/SH2 ) .
As shown in Fig .
3B , this fusion protein precipitates epitope-tagged SLAP-130 from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells ( lane 4 ) , but not from resting cells ( Zane 3 ) transfected with pEF/SLAP-130 .
The loss of function mutant of the SLP-76 SH2 domain when expressed as a GST fusion protein ( GST/R448K ) fails to associate with FLAG-SLAP-130 in either resting or pervanadate-stimulated 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 11676 1 > TAGGATGGAAACCCAGATCTAAAGTCCCTCATGGCGAAATATAACACGGGGGGCAACCCGACAGAGGATGTCTCA 45 20 b G K A Db V X® S L M A K ¥ N f G c w » f BE b v § 15 emcaaTACCCOACCCPTCAGACICACAGGGCCARACTCATCPPCAGGAATACAACCAAGAAAGAACTPATTCAAC - 120 v N s RoRok ROV T G BON s s s G I Q A R X LOF N 40 AACCAAGGAAATCCCAGCCCTCCTECAGGACCCAGCaATSTACCTAAGTTTGGSTCCCCAAAGCCACCTGTeGCA | 195 x g e N A s B p A G Bos N V B k F @ s 2 K B P Y A 65 | 270 v ok Bos s ® E K ® D K E BPoK P F s To G A 6 Q 90 AcATTCeqacACcAGCcAGCTTeaccACCAGAGACCCCGAGGCGmaAGTGGGATTTCTeAAACCTeTAGGCCCC - 345 R BOG T B A 8 LOT T R OD POE A K \ FOL k P V G P voc 115 AAGCCCATCAACTTGCCCAAAGAACATTCCAAACCTACATPTCCCTGSCOPCCTGGAAACAAGCCATCTCPTCAC - 420 KORB If N L PORK R D S K BOT FOP W oP NOK Pos 140 AGTGTAAACCAAGACCATGACTTARACCCACTAGGCCCGAAATCTGGRCCTACTCOTCCAACCTCAGAAAATGAA 425 s VY N q b H D L X B L G BoK s G ToR oBRom 3 ® N B 155 CRGAAGCRAGCOTTTCCCAAATTGACTGGCCTTAAACGGAAATTTATGTCAGCATCACAAGATCTTEAACCCAAG | 570 Q K Q A FoR kK L Om c v k G K F m s A S o n % BoK 120 - 545 PoL RoR K P A POG 9 s T E N s HOB D E 8 P 215 ATGAAGAATGTGTCTTCATCAAAAGGGTCCCCAGCTCCCCTGGGAGTCAGGTCCAAAAGCGSCCCTTTAAAACCA | 720 MOK N v S s s k G s BoA Bob G Vy R s K s 6 P OL K P 240 GCAAGGGAAGACTCAG TAAMGACCATGC TPPCAACTTIOCCCTITCCPEGACTCGPTPTGAA®A | 7 9 ?

Amino acid and eDNA sequence of SLAP-130 .
The 130-kDa protein which co-precipitates with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 was subjected to tryptic digestion for protein sequencing .
A peptide containing the sequence PPNDVLTK ( under/ined ) was found to be encoded by an EST clone which was used to isolate coding sequence 5 ' of the EST from a human thymus cDNA library .
The remaining cDNA was amplified by 3° RACE using total RNA from Jurkat T cells .

The protein precipitated by the wild type SLP-76 SH2 domain migrates identically to a protein detected by anti-FLAG immunoblot analysis of an anti-FLAG immunoprecipitate ( Zane 5 ) or whole cell lysates ( Zane 6 ) from Jurkat cells transfected with pEF/SLAP-130 .
Additionally , the FLAG-SLAP-130 protein migrates identically to an endogenous tyrosine-phosphorylated protein precipitated by the SLP-76 SH2 fusion protein from untransfected Jurkat cells stimulated with pervanadate ( lane 7 ) .
SLAP-130 and SLP-76 Associate in Cells-The association of SLP-76 and SLAP-130 in Jurkat T cells was investigated using anti-SLAP-130 sheep antiserum .
The anti-SLAP-130 anti-serum , but not preimmune serum , precipitates and immuno-blots a protein of 130 kDa in Jurkat T cell lysates ( Fig .
44 , lanes 1-3 ) .
To determine if SLAP-130 and SLP-76 associate within cells , lysates were prepared from resting and pervanadate stimulated Jurkat cells .
These lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SLP-76 , followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-SLAP-130 .
As shown , SLAP-130 is present in SLP-76 immunoprecipitates from resting Jurkat cells ( Fig .
44 , lane 4 ) .
These results are consistent with the low levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated SLAP-130 seen in unstimulated Jurkat cells ( see Fig .
4B ) and our previous finding of a 130-kDa phosphoprotein associated with SLP-76 in resting cells ( 4 ) .

SLAP-130 is a 130-kDa protein precipitated by the SH2 domain of SLP-76 .
A , lysates of Jurkat T cells transiently transfected with pEF/SLAP-130 contain a 180-kDa protein reactive with anti-FLAG mAb .
B , the SH2 domain of SLP-76 precipitates the epitope-tagged SLAP-130 from stimulated Jurkat T cells .
Jurkat T cells transfected with pEF/SLAP-180 were left unstimulated ( Zanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) or stimulated ( Zanes 2 , 4 , and 7 ) for 1 min with pervanadate ( PV ) .
Lysates prepared from 3 X 10 `` cells were incubated with GST fusion protein encoding the SH2 domain of SLP-76 ( GST lanes 3 and 4 ) or an analogous fusion protein containing a loss of function SLP-76 SH2 domain ( GST /R448K ; lanes 1 and 2 ) .
GST fusion protein precipitates as well as anti-FLAG immunoprecipitate ( Zane 5 ) and whole cell lysate ( lane 6 ) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG mAb .
Additionally , anti-phosphotyrosine ( « -PY ) Western blot of a GST/SH2 precipitate from untransfected pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells demonstrates that the 130-kDa protein associated with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 migrates the same as SLAP-180 ( Zane 7 ) .
in the resting state , as shown in Fig .
3B .
The amount of SLAP-130 associating with SLP-76 increases following stimulation of Jurkat with pervanadate ( Zane 5 ) .
We next investigated whether SLAP-130 is a substrate of the TCR-induced PTKs .
Jurkat T cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-TCR mAb or pervanadate .
At the indicated time points whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SLAP-130 antiserum followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb ( Fig .
4B , fop panel ) .
As noted above , there is a basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SLAP-130 in resting Jurkat .
TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SLAP-130 occurs maximally at 1 min and diminishes to basal levels within 15 min of TCR stimula-tion .
To demonstrate equal loading of SLAP-130 in each lane , the anti-phosphotyrosine blot was stripped and immunoblotted with anti-SLAP-130 antiserum ( Fig .
4B , lower panel ) .
Overexpression of SLAP-130 Interferes with TCR-mediated Activation of NFAT-We and others have shown that overexpression of SLP-76 augments TCR signals leading to IL-2 promoter activity ( 4 , 5 ) .
Since a functional SH2 domain is required for SLP-76 activity in Jurkat T cells ( 4 , 7 ) , we speculated that proteins associated with the SLP-76 SH2 domain would also 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog SLAP-130 , a Novel Substrate of the TCR-stimulated PTK A 1 2 3 4 5 kDa kDa 120 - summ cmm i 130 .

SLAP-130 associates with SLP-76 in Jurkat T cells and is a substrate of the TCR-induced PTKs .
A , Anti-SLAP-130 antiserum is reactive with a 180-kDa protein that co-precipitates with SLP-76 .
3 x 10 `` Jurkat T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either preimmune serum ( Zane 1 ) or anti-SLAP-130 antiserum ( lane 2 ) .
These immune complexes , in addition to whole cell lysates ( lane 3 ) , were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-SLAP-180 antiserum .
Whole cell lysates prepared from 5 X 10° unstimulated ( lane 4 ) or pervanadate-stimulated ( ane 5 ) Jurkat T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SLP-76 antiserum and then immunoblotted with anti-SLP-76 ( bottom panel ) and anti-SLAP-130 ( top panel ) antisera .
B , tyrosine phosphorylation of SLAP-180 in Jurkat T cells .
2 X 10 `` Jurkat T cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-TCR mAb ( C305 acites 1:1000 ) for indicated times or pervanadate for 1 min .
Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SLAP-180 antiserum and Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb ( @ -PY , top panel ) .
The « -PY blot was stripped and immunoblotted with anti-SLAP-130 antiserum ( Zower panel ) to demonstrate the amount of SLAP-130 in each lane .
regulate signals through the TCR in a positive manner .
To determine the effect of SLAP-130 on signals generated by TCR ligation , Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with pEF/ SLAP-130 or a control vector and a luciferase reporter construct driven by the NFAT response element .
Fig .
5A demonstrates that , in contrast to the effect of SLP-76 on T cell signaling , overexpression of SLAP-130 results in diminished NFAT activity following TCR ligation .
Furthermore , co-trans-fection of SLAP-130 and SLP-76 reveals that overexpression of SLAP-130 inhibits the augmentation of TCR-stimulated IL-2 promoter activity by SLP-76 .
Expression of the FLAG-tagged cDNAs was confirmed by immunoblotting whole cell lysates with anti-FLAG mAb .
We were surprised to discover that overexpression of SLAP-130 appears to interfere with TCR-induced NFAT activation in Jurkat cells and , additionally , inhibits the ability of transfected SLP-76 to augment TCR responses .
Unfortunately , the primary sequence of SLAP-130 does not provide insight into how it may function as an inhibitor of TCR-induced NFAT activa-tion .
Structure-function experiments are ongoing to determine the regions of SLAP-130 required for its inhibitory effects .
Northern blot analyses indicate that SLP-76 and SLAP-130 are expressed coordinately in hematopoietic tissues .
Defining their role in other hematopoietic cells may provide insight into how these proteins regulate T cell signals .
We have found an association between the SLP-76 SH2 domain and a 130-kDa protein in rat basophillic leukemia cells ( 15 ) .

Overexpression of SLAP-130 diminishes transcrip-tional activation through the NFAT response element .
Jurkat T cells were transfected with NFAT-luc , cytomegalovirus-B-galactosidase , and either vector control , pEF/SLP-76 , pEF/SLAP-180 , or both pEF/ SLAP-180 and pEF/SLP-76 .
The amount of DNA in each sample was equalized with vector control .
24 h following transfection , cells were stimulated in triplicate with anti-TCR mAb for 10 h and then assayed for luciferase activity .
Luciferase light units were normalized to B-galactosidase activity in each transfectant .
Expression of the epitope-tagged constructs was determined by preparing whole cell lysates from 10° transfected cells and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG mAb .
of the high affinity receptor for IgE on rat basophillic leukemia cells leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 ( 15 ) , experiments are ongoing to determine if overexpression of SLP-76 augments signaling events downstream of receptor binding in these cells .
Similarly , it will be of interest to determine if overexpression of SLAP-130 impacts negatively on signal transduction via the IgE receptor .
It will be important to determine if the down-regulation of TCR-induced NFAT activation by overexpression of SLAP-130 requires an interaction between SLP-76 and SLAP-130 .
Experiments are in progress to determine the site on SLAP-130 responsible for its interaction with SLP-76 .
Manipulation of the SLAP-130 cDNA prior to transfection into Jurkat cells expressing wild type or overexpressed levels of SLP-76 will facilitate our understanding of how these two molecules may interact to regulate signals downstream of TCR engagement .
