From the { Division of Molecular Oncology , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri 63110 and the §McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research , University of Wisconsin Medical School , Madison , Wisconsin 53706 Transcriptional up-regulation of the c-sis/platelet-derived growth factor-B ( PDGF-B ) proto-oncogene by the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 has been implicated as one possible mechanism of cellular transformation by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 .
In previous work , we identified an essential site in the c-sis [ PDGF-B promoter , Tax-responsive element 1 ( TRE1 ) , necessary for transactivation by Tax .
We also identified Spl , Sp3 , and NGFI-A/Egr-1 as the primary nuclear transcription factors binding to TREl which mediate Tax responsiveness .
In the present work , we have investigated the mechanism ( s ) whereby Tax transactivates the c-sis/PDGF-B proto-oncogene .
In vitro transcription assays showed that Tax was able to significantly increase the transcriptional activity of a template containing the -257 to +74 region of the c-sis/ PDGF-B promoter .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis showed that Tax increased the DNA binding activity of both Spl and NGFI-A/Egr-1 using a TRE1l probe .
Analysis of Tax mutants showed that two mutants , IEXC29S8 and IEXL320G , were unable to significantly transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter .
Finally , co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Tax is able to stably bind to both Spl and NGFI-A/Egr-1 .
Interestingly , co-immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that Tax mutant IEXC29S8 is unable to interact with NGFT-A/Egr-1 , whereas Tax mutant IEXL320G is able to interact with NGFT-A/Egr-1 .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org ical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 associated myelopathy , in humans ( 2 , 3 ) .
Replication of the virus is strongly dependent upon expression of the virally encoded Tax protein , a potent trans-activator of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat ( 4-8 ) .
Tax is highly pleiotropic , as it has been shown to transcriptionally activate a wide variety of cellular genes , including IL-2 ( 9 ) , IL-2Ra ( 9 ) , granulocyte macrophage/colony-stimulating factor ( 9 ) , transforming growth factor B ( 9 ) , c-fos ( 9 ) , and e-sis ( 10 ) .
Tax does not bind DNA directly ( 11 , 12 ) , but appears to stimulate RNA synthesis mediated through several structurally unrelated cellular transcriptional activator proteins .
These include members of the cAMP response element binding proteins and activating transcription factor ( CREB/ATF ) family , serum response factor , Fos-Jun , and the NF- « B family of transcription regulatory proteins ( 13-20 ) .
The expression of only a single gene , the B-polymerase gene , has been shown to be repressed by Tax ( 21 , 22 ) .
The c-sis proto-oncogene , which encodes the B-chain of platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) ( 283 , 24 ) , is actively transcribed in T-cells infected with HTLV-1 .
The transcript has been cloned and sequenced , and is apparently normal ( 25-27 ) .
Expression of c-sis is normally tightly regulated in a cell type-and developmental stage-specific manner and is thought to play a role in wound healing and early development ( 28 ) .
It is not normally expressed , however , in lymphocytes .
PDGF is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for cells of mesenchymal origin ( 29 ) .
Biologically active PDGF is a dimeric protein consisting of homo- and heterodimeric combinations of two polypeptide chains , A and B ( 30 ) .
The major function of PDGF is to induce mitosis in quiescent target cells .
PDGF exerts its effects through binding to two types of receptors , the a receptor , which binds both A and B chains with high affinity , and the B receptor , which binds only the B chain ( 31 ) .
PDGF was first implicated in the process of transformation when one of its polypeptide chains , the B-chain/c-sis , was found to be homolo-gous to the viral sis oncogene ( v-sis ) ( 23 , 24 ) .
Indeed , expression of a recombinant , wild-type human c-sis/PDGF-B gene in mouse 3T3 cells , which express both the a and B PDGF receptors , resulted in the transformation of these cells ( 32 ) .
Because lymphocytes in general were thought to have no receptors for PDGF , it was previously postulated that the c-sis/ PDGF-B expression in HTLV-1 infected T-cells could possibly provide a paracrine function , perhaps stimulating stromal cells , or other nonlymphocytic cells known to have PDGF re-ceptors .
More recently , however , it has been demonstrated that HTLV-1 infected T-cells also express high levels of PDGF-B receptor transcripts and synthesize protein that can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the PDGF receptor that binds the PDGF-B homodimer and the PDGF-AB het- 27411 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 27412 erodimer ( 83 ) .
These findings suggest the possibility that HTLV-1 infected T-cells might acquire an auotcrine mechanism of cell proliferation that involves PDGF .
With regard to the regulatory mechanism ( s ) that underlies c-sis/PDGF-B expression in HTLV-1-infected T-cells , previous work from our laboratory ( 34 ) , and others ( 35-39 ) , identified a regulatory site at -64 to -45 within the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter , that we named Tax-responsive element 1 ( TRE1 ) .
This regulatory site was shown to be essential for transactivation by Tax .
In addition , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) analysis and antibody supershift analysis of TRE1-binding proteins in Jurkat-E6.1 and Jurkat-Tax cell nuclear extracts , along with nuclear extracts prepared from the HTLV-1 infected T-cell line , HUT1O2 , identified the Sp family members , Spl and Sp3 , along with a member of the immediate early response gene family , NGFI-A/Egr-1 ( for the sake of simplicity , NGFT-A/Egr-1 from this point on will be referred to as Egr-1 ) , as the main TRE1-binding factors mediating Tax-responsiveness .
In the current study , we have investigated the mechanism ( s ) whereby Tax transactivates the c-sis/PDGF-B proto-oncogene promoter .
In vitro transcription analysis showed that Tax was able to markedly increase RNA synthesis from a template containing the -257 to +74 region of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter .
Site-directed mutagenesis of the TRE1 region was used to identify a CCACCC and GNGNGGGNG motif essential for transactivation by Tax .
EMSA analysis hinted at a possible mechanism of Tax transactivation in that Tax was able to substantially increase the DNA binding activity of both Spl and Egr-1 to their DNA recognition sites contained within TRE1 .
In addition , EMSA analysis also indicated the possibility of ternary complex formation consisting of Spl or Egr-1 , Tax , and DNA , suggesting that Tax might stably interact with both Spl and Egr-1 through protein-protein contacts .
We show by co-immunoprecipitation analysis that Tax does indeed stably interact with both Spl and Egr-1 in both the absence of DNA and from intact cells .
Finally , we identified two Tax mutants , C298 and L320G , that were unable to transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter by more than 2-fold .
Interestingly , co-immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that Tax mutant C298 was unable to interact with Egr-1 , whereas , Tax mutant L320G was able to interact with Egr-1 .
The results presented in this article support the possibility of the existence of an additional , as yet uncharacterized , pathway of transactivation by Tax involving members of the zinc finger family of transcription factors .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture-The T-cell lines , Jurkat E6.1 and Jurkat-Tax ( J-tax-19 ; a generous gift from Warner C.

and ionomycin ( 0.4 ug/ml ) , and the other flask received the same volume of solvent .
Thirty-six hours after stimulation , the cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and cell lysates were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing in an ethanol/dry ice bath and 37 °C water bath .
Cell extracts were normalized for protein content by a commercially available kit ( Bio-Rad ) .
Equal amounts of protein were used for the luciferase assays as described previously ( 84 ) .
For the analysis of the Tax mutants , 5 X 10° Jurkat E6.1 cells were transfected with 3 pg of the pRALuc luciferase reporter plasmid alone or , plus , where indicated , 3 ug of the wild-type Tax expression plasmid , IEX , or the Tax mutant expression plasmids , IEXS10A , IEXC29S , IEXHA43Q , IEXS258A , and L820G , using the Lipofectin reagent method protocol ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .

EMSAs-The following double-stranded oligonucleotide probes , corresponding to nucleotides -83 to -45 of the e-sis/PDGF-B promoter and containing the TRE1 region , or a mutated CCACCC motif of the TREL region , respectively , were prepared by annealing complementary , sin-gle-stranded oligonucleotides ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) in a thermocycler ( 95 °C for 5 min , cool to 25 °C at 1 °C/min ) : TRE1 , 5-GCCAGAAGAG-GAAAGGCTGTCTCCACCCACCTCTCGCAC-3 ' ; TRE1-mSpl , 5'-GC-CAGAAGAGGAAAGGCTGTCTGATCGAACCTCTCGCAC-3 ' .
Each probe was end-labeled with [ y-°°P ] ATP ( ICN Biomedicals , Inc. ) and T4 polynucleotide kinase ( New England Biolabs ) .

In samples containing TaxH , , , approximately 400 ng of purified TaxH , was used in each reaction .
EMSA analysis with dilutions of TaxH , down to 25 ng was also performed , with similar results observed ( data not shown ) .
Once all of the appropriate factors had been added to each sample , the samples were allowed to incubate 5 min at room temperature in 1 X Superdex buffer prior to the addition of labeled probe .
After the addition of labeled probe , the mixture was incubated a further 10 min at room temperature .
The DNA-protein complexes were then resolved by electrophoresis on a 5 % nondenatur-ing , polyacrylamide gel ( acrylamide/N , NV'-methylenebisacrylamide weight ratio , 49:1 ) at 165 V for 4 h at 4 °C in 1 X TGE buffer ( 25 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.5 ) , 190 mM glycine , 1 mM EDTA ) .

In reactions containing oTaxC Ab , 2 pul of antiserum was added to the appropriate samples and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C , along with poly ( dI-dC ) in 1 X Superdex buffer , for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of the labeled DNA probe .
The gels were then dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h and exposed to XAR-5 film .
Immunoprecipitation-Co-immunoprecipitation reactions ( 50 ul ) , using purified proteins , contained approximately 200 ng of either purified Spl ( Promega ) or purified NGFT-A/Egr-1H , , and approximately 400 ng of purified TaxH , in 1 X Superdex buffer .

27413 Immunoprecipitation Analysis of Tax Mutants in COS-7 Cells-5 ug of either the wild type Tax expression plasmid , IEX , or the Tax mutant expression plasmids , IEXC29S and IEXL820G , were transfected into 40-60 % confluent COS-7 cells in a 100-mm tissue culture dish , either alone or with 5 ug of the Eigr-1 expression plasmid , pJDM948 , using the Lipofectin reagent method protocol ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
5 ug of pJDM948 was also transfected alone into 40-60 % confluent COS-7 cells in a 100-mm tissue culture dish as a control for Egr-1 expression .
Each of the transfections was performed in triplicate .
Forty-eight hours post-transfection , the cells were washed with PBS , harvested by trypsinization , and pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C .

For the Egr-1 alone sample , a whole cell extract was prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing in an ethanol/dry ice bath and 37°C water bath .
5 ul of pooled Tax mAbs was added to each sample , except the Egr-1 alone sample , and the samples were then incubated for 1 h on a rotator at 4 °C .
50 ul of a 50 % slurry solution of immobilized rProtein A-Sepharose ( Repligen Corp. ) was then added to each sample .
The reaction mixtures were incubated for 18-24 h on a rotator at 4 °C .

The reactions were preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C prior to the addition of the NTPs and then were allowed to proceed for 1 h at 30 °C after the addition of the NTPs .
When indicated , e-amanitin was added to the in vitro transcription reactions to a final concentration of 5 ug/ml .
Reactions were terminated by adding 175 ul of stop solution ( 300 mm Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 300 mM sodium acetate , 0.5 % SDS , 2 mM EDTA , 3 pg/ml tRNA ) , and extracted with 200 ul phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 25:24:1 ) .
Each reaction was then passed over a Micro-Spin 8-300 HR column ( Pharmacia Biotech ) .
The reactions were then precipitated with 500 ul of 100 % ethanol , placed on dry ice for 15 min , pelleted , washed with 70 % ethanol , pelleted , and dried in a vacuum dessicator for 10 min .
The pellets were resuspended in loading dye , heated at 90 °C for 10 min , and analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 5 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea .
The gels were then dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h , exposed to XAR-5 film , and bands corresponding to full-length transcripts were quantitated with a densitometer ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc. ) .
RESULTS In Vitro Transcription from the c-sis/PDGF-B Promoter Is Enhanced by HTLV-1 Tax-The effect ( s ) of HTLV-1 Tax on transcription of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter was investigated using an in vitro run-off transcription assay supported by nuclear extracts prepared from stimulated Jurkat E6.1 cells .
Transcription from the template DNA fragment , containing the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter , was designed to generate an RNA transcript of 697 nucleotides ( represented schematically in Fig .
1A ) .
The results presented in lane 2 of Fig .
1B demonstrate that the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter is efficiently transcribed using stimulated Jurkat E6.1 nuclear extracts in the in vitro run-off transcription assays .
The addition of Tax to the in vitro run-off transcription assays resulted in an 11-fold increase in transcription above that observed in the absence of Tax ( Fig .
1B , compare lane 3 versus lane 2 ) .
To demonstrate that the transactivation activity was specific to Tax , a control extract containing no Tax protein ( see `` Materials and Methods `` ) was added to the reactions .
As shown in Fig .
1B , Zane 4 , the addition of the control extract did not result in an increase of transcrip- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 27414 HTLV-1 Tax Interacts A with Sp1 and Egr-1 l— e-sis/PDGF-B Promoter —* Fig .

To demonstrate that the transcription observed in our in vitro run-off transcription assays was mediated by RNA polymerase II ( pol II ) , the pol II inhibitor , « -amanitin ( a bicyclic octapeptide from the mushroom Amanita phalloides ) , was added to the reactions .
At low concentrations , a-amanitin selectively inhibits pol II-dependent transcription through binding to the largest subunit of pol II and blocking transcription elongation ( 46-49 ) .
Transcription from the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter was completely abolished upon addition of « -amanitin to 5 ug/ml ( Fig .
1B , lane 5 ) , as well as transactivation by Tax ( Fig .
1B , lane 6 ) .
To demonstrate the necessity of the TRE ] region for both basal transcription and transactivation by Tax , in vitro run-off transcription reactions were performed using the pRALuc linker-insertion mutants -64/-55 , -54/-45 , and -34/-25 as tem-plates .
Each mutant contains a 10-bp substitution linker sequence at the designated nucleotides .
Mutants -64/-55 and -54/-45 disrupt TRE1l while mutant -34/-25 disrupts the TATA box/initiator region .
As shown in Fig .
1B , transcription from the mutant templates -64/-55 and -54/-45 is significantly reduced both in the absence and presence of Tax ( compare lane 7 versus lanes 1 and 8 , and lane 9 versus lanes 1 and 10 , respectively ) .
When the TATA box/initiator region is disrupted by mutant -34/-25 , transcription from this template is completely abolished in both the absence and presence of Tax ( Fig .
1B , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
These data demonstrate Tax 's ability to enhance pol II-dependent transcription from the c-sis/ PDGF-B promoter in an in vitro run-off transcription assay along with the relative importance of the TRE1 region for both basal transcription and Tax-mediated transactivation .
Site-directed Mutagenesis of TRE1I-To further investigate the regulatory region contained within TRE1 , a series of c-sis/ PDGF-B promoter mutants containing high-resolution mutations ( Fig .

resulted in a decrease in activity comparable to that observed with either of the two 10-bp linker insertion mutants , -64/-55 and -54/-45 .
In contrast , mutants YL4-YL7 were each significantly lower in activity than the wild-type , pRALuc , but no single mutant caused a reduction equal to that observed with either -64/-55 or -54/-45 .
This analysis indicated the importance of a CCACCC motif ( ablated by mutants YL1-Y¥L3 ) , along with the importance of a GNGNGGGNG motif ( ablated by mutants YL1-YL5 ) , for Tax-responsiveness .
The CCACCC motif has been previously identified as a cis-acting regulatory element , capable of binding members of the Sp family of transcription factors , in the promoters of several genes , some of which include the human embryonic eglobin gene ( 50 ) , the parathyroid hormone-related protein ( PTHrP ) gene ( 51 ) , the human IL-2 gene ( 52 ) , and the human leukosia-lin ( CD43 ) gene ( 53 ) .
Likewise , the GNGNGGGNG motif ( 54 ) has been previously identified as a cis-acting regulatory element , capable of binding members of the immediate-early transcription factor gene family , in the promoters of several genes , some of which include the phenylethanolamine N-methylItrans-ferase gene ( 55 ) , the human tumor necrosis factor gene ( 56 ) , and the human IL-2 gene ( 52 ) .
Shown in Fig .
3A are the consensus DNA binding sequences for the Sp transcription factor family member , Spl ( 57 ) , containing the CCACCC motif in its core , and the immediate-early transcription factor gene family member , Egr-1 ( 54 ) .
It is interesting to note that TRE1L contains both the Spl core recognition sequence and the Egr-1 consensus DNA recognition sequence ( Fig .
34 ) .
Initial EMSA analyses of T-cell line nuclear proteins that bound to TRE1L demonstrated that both Spl and Egr-1 did indeed bind to TRE1 , and that this binding was essential for Tax responsiveness ( 34 ) .
Similar regions found in the PTHrP gene promoter and the IL-2 gene promoter , two genes that have also been 27415 demonstrated to be transactivated by Tax ( 58 , 59 ) , are shown in Fig .
3B .
The PTHrP promoter contains the core of the Spl consensus DNA recognition sequence ( the CCACCC motif ) , whereas , the IL-2 promoter contains both the core of the Spl consensus DNA recognition sequence ( the CCACCC motif ) , and the Egr-1 consensus DNA recognition sequence ( the GNGNGGGNG motif ) .
HTLV-1 Tax Enhances the DNA Binding Activity of Sp1 and Egr-1-With the knowledge that two of the main TRE1-binding proteins consisted of Spl and Egr-1 , and that this binding was essential for Tax responsiveness , we next sought to investigate whether Tax could enhance the binding of either Spl or Egr-1 , or both , to TRE1 by EMSA analysis .
A previous report on the effects of Tax on the DNA binding activity of eukaryotic transcription factors demonstrated that Tax enhanced the site-specific DNA binding activity of Spl to a GC-rich recognition sequence , containing a CCACCC motif , found within the HTLV-1 promoter ( 13 ) .
This Spl-binding site in the HTLV-1 promoter is located in a region previously shown to be Tax-responsive in vivo ( 60 ) .
As shown in Fig .
4 , Tax dramatically increased the amount of protein-DNA complex formed between .
Spl and a probe containing the TRE1l site ( compare lane 2 versus lane 3 ; Spl C1 ) .
Similarly , Tax also dramatically increased the amount of protein-DNA complex formed between Egr-1 and the TREl probe ( compare lane 6 versus lane 7 ; Egr-1H , C1 ) .
The binding of both Spl and Egr-1 was specific for the TRE1 probe since an excess of unlabeled TRE1 probe competed for their binding ( ane 4 and lane 8 , respectively ) .
Interestingly , the addition of Tax to the binding reaction mixtures of both Spl and Egr-1 also resulted in the formation of an additional shifted complex ( Spl C2 and Egr-1H , C2 , respectively ) migrating slower than either Spl C1 or Egr-1H4 C1 ( lanes 3 and 7 , respectively ) .
We next investigated the importance of the CCACCC and GNGNGGGNG motifs , contained within TRE1 , for Spl and Egr-1 binding , in both the presence and absence of Tax .
As shown in Fig .
4 , the binding of both Spl and Egr-1 , in the presence and absence of Tax , was completely abolished when a probe containing both a mutated CCACCC motif , and GNGNGGGNG motif , was used in the EMSA analysis ( lanes 9-13 ) .
Thus , these results demonstrate Tax 's ability to increase the DNA binding activity of the zinc finger transcription factors , Spl and Egr-1 , to TRE1 , along with the relative importance of the CCACCC and GNGNGGGNG motifs contained within Ternary Complex Formation between Either Sp1 or Egr-1 , Tax , and DNA-The observation that the addition of Tax to the binding reaction mixtures resulted in the formation of additional , slower migrating , shifted complexes ( Fig .
4 and Fig .
5 , Spl C2 and Egr-1H , , C2 ) prompted us to investigate the possibility that Tax , itself , was stably incorporated into the complex .
We addressed this possibility by antibody supershift analysis utilizing the TRE1 probe mentioned above .
As shown in Fig .
5 , when an antibody directed against Tax was included in either the Spl ( compare lane 4 versus lanes 2 and 3 ) or Egr-1 ( compare lane 7 versus lanes 5 and 6 ) samples containing Tax , not only was Tax-mediated enhancement of binding abolished , but also , basal binding of Spl and Egr-1 was completely abolished .
Sur-prisingly , the addition of anti-Tax antibody did not give rise to the formation of antibody supershifted complexes , but , rather , completely blocked the formation of all shifted complexes .
This effect was not due to the antibody directly interfering with the binding activity of Spl or Egr-1 , since their binding was not inhibited by the antibody in the absence of Tax ( Zane 8 and lane 9 , respectively ) .
In addition , this effect of the antibody was specific for Tax , since preimmune serum did not affect Tax-mediated enhancement of either Spl or Egr-1 binding ( lane 10 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 27416 HTLV-1 Tax Interacts with Sp1 and Egr-1 8 `` qu ‘ so “ 24 & ® f ye ?

Binding reactions were carried out in the absence ( lanes 2 and 6 , respectively ) or presence of TaxH , , ( Zanes 3 and 7 , respectively ) .
To demonstrate specificity of binding , Spl ( Zane 4 ) and Egr-1H , ( Zane 8 ) were incubated in the presence of a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled TRE1 probe .

Inhibition of Tax-mediated enhancement of Spl and Egr-1 DNA binding activity by Tax-specific antisera .
Spl and Egr-l Tax-mediated supershift complex formation was assayed by EMSA analysis using Tax-specific antisera .
Purified Spl ( ~1 ng ) was incubated with a probe containing the TRE1 site of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter either alone ( ane 2 ) , in the presence of TaxH , ( Zane 3 ) , or in the presence of TaxH , and 2 pul of Tax-antisera ( @ TaxC Ab ) ( Zane 4 ) .

To demonstrate that the eTaxC Ab did not effect Spl or Egr-1H , , binding in the absence of TaxH , , both Sp1 ( Zane 8 ) and Egr-1H , , ( lane 9 ) were incubated in the presence of aTaxC Ab alone .
Specificity of eTaxC Ab is demonstrated by incubation of either Spl ( lane 10 ) or Egr-1H , ( Zane 11 ) , with preimmune sera in the presence of TaxH , .
As a control , the TRE1L probe was incubated by itself ( Zane 1 ) , with « TaxC Ab only ( Zane 12 ) , or with preimmune sera only ( lane 13 ) .
Binding reactions were carried out as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``

Thus , these results support the possibility that Tax is incorporated into the shifted complexes , resulting in the formation of ternary complexes , possibly through protein-protein contacts with Spl and Eigr-1 .
HTLV-1 Tax Physically Interacts with Both Sp1 and Egr-1-To investigate the potential interaction of Tax with either Spl or Egr-1 , in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using purified proteins .

Transactivation ability of HTLV-1 Tax mutants on the e-sis [ PDGF-B promoter in Jurkat E6.1 cells .

The cells were then treated with 10 ng/ml TPA and 0.4 pg/ml ionomycin and subsequently lysed and assayed for luciferase activity as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
After subtraction of background activity from all of the reporter constructs , pRALuc was arbitrarily designated as 1 X fold induction and the activities of the other transfections were adjusted relative to this activity .

Taken together , these findings demonstrate that Tax physically interacts with both Spl and Egr-1 , through protein-protein contacts .
Ability of HTLV-1 Tax Mutants to Transactivate the c-sis/ PDGF-B Promoter-To examine the transactivation activities of Tax mutants on the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter , Jurkat E6.1 cells were transiently transfected with the pRALuc luciferase reporter plasmid either alone or together with the wild-type or mutant Tax expression plasmids , IEX , IEXS10A , IEXC29S5 , IEXH43Q , IEXS258A , and IEXL8320G .
The cells were then stimulated with TPA and ionomycin to transiently activate the expression of Egr-1 .
Luciferase activity was then measured .
As shown in Fig .
8 , wild-type Tax , IEX , resulted in a greater than 14-fold induction of the e-sis/PDGF-B promoter and Tax mutants IEXS10A , IEXH43Q , and IEXS258A all resulted in a 4-fold or greater induction .
In contrast , Tax mutants IEXC298 ( < 2-fold ) and IEXL320G ( 2-fold ) were significantly impaired in their ability to transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter .
Analysis of HTLV-1 Tax Mutants IEXC29S and IEXL320G to Interact with Egr-1-With the knowledge that the HTLV-1 Tax mutants IEXC29S and IEXL820G were unable to significantly transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter , we reasoned that this might be a result of their inability to interact with Egr-1 .
The idea of focusing on the interaction between Tax and Egr-1 , and not Tax and Sp1 , is based on the observations that Spl and Egr-1-binding sites in the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter overlap and Spl is displaced by increasing amounts of Egr-1 that arise upon stimulation ( 37 ) .
To investigate Tax-Egr-1 interactions , we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation reactions in which the wild-type Tax expression plasmid , IEX , or the Tax mutant expression plasmids , IEXC295 and IEXL320G , were transiently cotransfected into COS-7 cells along with the Egr-1 expression plasmid , pJDM948 , and immunoprecipitated with « e-Tax monoclonal antibodies .

Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of HTLV-1 Tax mutants and Egr-1 .
Five ug of the wild-type Tax expression plasmid , IEX ( lane 2 ) , or the Tax mutant expression plasmids IEXC298S ( Zane 3 ) , and IEXL320G ( Zane 4 ) , were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells either alone or cotransfected with the Egr-1 expression plasmid , pJDM948 ( lanes 5-7 , respectively ) .
Whole cell extracts were prepared and co-immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
Five ug of pJDM948 was also transfected alone into COS-7 cells as a control for Egr-1 expression ( Zane 8 ) .
For the Egr-1 alone sample , a whole cell extract was prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing in an ethanol/dry ice bath and 37 °C water bath .
Western blots ( WB ) for Egr-1 and Tax are indicated to the Zeft of each blot .
The Egr-1 and Tax bands are indicated by arrows to the right of the each gel .
Molecular weight markers are indicated in kilodaltons ( kDa ) to the left of each individual Western blot .
of approximately 85 kDa , corresponding to Egr-1 , was detected in the sample containing wild-type Tax , IEX ( lane 5 ) , and interestingly , also in the sample containing the Tax mutant IEXL320G ( Zane 7 ) .
This band also comigrated with the band detected in the positive control sample using a whole cell extract prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with the Eigr-1 expression plasmid alone ( Fig .
9 , Zane 8 ) .
In contrast , this same band , corresponding to Egr-1 , was not detected in the sample containing the Tax mutant IEXC29S5 ( Fig .
9 , lane 6 ) .
Thus , these results suggest that protein-protein interactions between Tax and Egr-1 are necessary , but not sufficient , to support Tax-mediated transactivation of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter .
DISCUSSION In this study , we have investigated the mechanism of HTLV-1 Tax-mediated transactivation of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter by in vitro transcription assay and site-directed mutation analysis , along with EMSA and co-immunoprecipitation analysis .
We have shown by in vitro transcription assay analysis that addition of Tax to the in vitro transcription reaction led to an 11-fold increase in RNA synthesis ( Fig .
1B , compare lane 3 versus lane 2 ) .
It has previously been reported that Tax-mediated in vitro transcription from the HTLV-1 promoter is resistant to low levels of e-amanitin ( at low concentrations , a « -amanitin selectively inhibits RNA pol II ) in reactions containing either HeLa or CEM T-cell extract .
This is surprising in light of the fact that the HTLV-1 promoter contains all of the structural features of a typical RNA pol II transcription tem-plate : a TATA box ~30 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site , binding sites for several pol II transcription factors , and long poly ( A ) RNA is synthesized from the integrated HTLV-1 proviral DNA in vivo .
In addition , in vitro transcription experiments , supported by either Hela or CEM T-cell extracts , showed that the HTLV-1 promoter contains overlapping transcription units which utilize the same transcription initiation site as that of pol II-dependent transcription .
Fur 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog HTLV-1 Tax Interacts with Sp1 and Egr-1 thermore , neutralization and depletion experiments with pol II antibodies strongly suggested that classical pol II is not involved in the HTLV-1 overlapping transcription unit ( 61 , 62 ) .
Similarly , the e-sis/PDGF-B promoter contains all of the structural features of a typical RNA pol II transcription tem-plate : a TATA box ~30 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site , binding sites for several pol II transcription factors , and poly ( A ) * RNA transcripts are synthesized from the promoter .
Given the above mentioned data and the fact that our in vitro run-off transcription assays were supported by nuclear extracts prepared from stimulated Jurkat E6.1 T-cells , we tested our in vitro transcription assays for pol II-dependent transcription .
We showed that both transcription in the absence of Tax , and Tax-mediated transactivation , was completely inhibited at a low concentration of « -amanitin ( Fig .
1B , compare lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 2 and 3 ) .
In addition , we also demonstrated the relevant importance of the TRE1 region for Tax-mediated transactivation by using DNA templates containing linker-insertion substitution mutations within TRE1 ( Fig .
1B , lanes 7-10 ) .
This would suggest that the binding of Spl or Egr-1 to TRE1 is essential for transactivation mediated by Tax .
Together , these results indicated that Tax was able to greatly stimulate RNA synthesis in vitro from the c-sis/ PDGF-B promoter , and that this Tax-mediated transactivation was dependent not only on RNA pol II , but also on the binding of either Spl or Egr-1 to the TRE1 region .
When the SIS-Lue TRE1 site-directed mutants were analyzed for Tax-responsiveness , a CCACCC motif ( mutants YL1-YL3 ) and a GNGNGGGNG motif ( mutants YL1-YL5 ) were clearly identified as being essential for conferring Tax responsiveness in stimulated Jurkat-Tax cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
That the results observed in this experiment were indeed due to Tax and not a result of the effects of TPA and ionomycin stimulation is evidenced by the fact that we have previously ( 34 ) analyzed a series of linker-scanning substitution mutants within the TRE1 region using unstimulated Jurkat E6.1 cells versus unstimulated Jurkat-Tax cells and observed the same results as those presented in this article .
It should also be noted that stimulation in the presence of Tax results in a synergistic activation of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter .
Stimulation is necessary to transiently activate the expression of Egr-1 .
The CCACCC motif has been previously reported to be a positive regulatory element in the promoters of several genes , capable of binding members of the Sp family of zinc finger transcription factors ( 50-53 ) .
Indeed , the nucleotides CCACCC also comprise the core nucleotide sequence of the DNA recognition sequence for the Sp family member , Spl ( Fig .
34 ) ( 57 ) .
This same CCACCC motif has also been demonstrated to be critical for transcription of the c-sis/PDGF-B gene in the human osteosarcoma cell line , U2-O8 , involving the Sp family members , Spl and Sp3 ( 35 , 38 ) .
Likewise , the GNGNGGGNG motif has also been previously reported to be a positive cis-acting regulatory element found in the promoters of several genes , capable of binding the zinc finger transcription factor Eigr-1 , which is a member of the immediate-early transcription factor gene family ( 52 , 55 , 56 ) .
Previous work from our laboratory ( 34 ) demonstrated that the main nuclear factors binding to TRE1L from the stimulated T-cell lines , Jurkat E6.1 and Jurkat-Tax , along with the HTLV-1 infected T-cell line , HUT1O2 , included the Sp family members Spl and Sp3 , along with the immediate-early transcription factor gene family member , Egr-1 .
Fur-thermore , it should be noted that since the TRE1 region of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter contains overlapping binding sites for the Sp family members , Spl and Sp3 , and the immediate-early transcription factor gene family member , Egr-1 , these factors can not associate together and simultaneously bind to TREL .
27419 Indeed , it has recently been shown that in unstimulated cells , Spl occupies this element and is displaced by increasing amounts of Egr-1 upon stimulation ( 87 ) .
Both the CCACCC motif , and the GNGNGGGNG motif , are also found in the promoters of two genes previously shown to be up-regulated and transactivated by Tax .
These include the PTHrP gene and the IL-2 gene ( Fig .
3B ) ( 58 , 59 ) .
These motifs represent binding sites for members of the zinc finger family of transcription factors .
This proves to be interesting in light of previous experiments carried out to investigate the mecha-nism { ( s ) of Tax-mediated transactivation .
Site-directed muta-tional analysis of Tax has allowed for an approximate demarcation of regions within the Tax protein itself necessary for transactivation ( 41 , 63 ) .
These analyses indicated that Tax transactivation of viral and cellular promoters occurs through at least two distinct cellular transcription pathways : 1 ) the CREB/ATF family and 2 ) the NFxB/Rel protein family of transcription factors .
It now appears that an additional Tax-mediated transactivation pathway exists involving members of the zinc finger family of transcription factors .
EMSA analysis showed that Tax dramatically enhanced the site-specific DNA binding activity of the zinc finger transcription factors Spl ( Fig .
4 , compare lane 2 versus lane 3 ) and Egr-1 ( Fig .
4 , compare lane 6 versus lane 7 ) to a probe containing the TRE1 site .
This is consistent with previous reports which suggested that Tax may deregulate target genes by enhancing the DNA binding activity of the cellular transcription factors that recognize the Tax-responsive promoter elements ( 19 , 20 , 64 ) .
Indeed , Tax has been shown to increase the DNA binding activity of a wide variety of eukaryotic transcription factors , including , members of the CREB/ATF family of proteins , serum response factor , Fos-Jun , and the NFB subunits , p50 and p65 ( 13 , 14 ) .
Mutation of the CCACCC and GNGNGGGNG motifs prevented the binding of Spl and Eigr-1 , respectively , to the TRE1 probe , in both the presence and absence of Tax ( Fig .
4 , lanes 9-13 ) .
This further demonstrated the importance of each of these motifs for conferring Tax responsiveness .
EMSA analysis also indicated that Tax altered the mobility of both the Sp1l-DNA complex ( Fig .
4 , lane 3 , Spl C2 ) and the Egr-1-DNA complex ( Fig .
4 , lane 7 , Egr-1H4 C2 ) , suggesting that the observed increase in DNA binding activity for Spl and Egr-1 ( mediated by Tax ) involves Tax entering into the com-plex , leading to the formation of ternary complexes .
It is possible that the Spl C2 and Egr-1H , C2 complexes are the result of Tax increasing the affinity of a less abundant complex that was previously not visible in the Tax-minus samples ( Fig .
4 , lanes 2 and 6 , respectively ) .
However , this was not the case since these CZ complexes were not observed upon overexposure of the autoradiogram ( data not shown ) .
This was further substantiated by the finding that an antibody directed against the C-terminal 13 amino acids of Tax was able to completely abolish the formation of the Spl-DNA complexes Spl C1 and Spl C2 ( Fig .
5 , lane 4 ) , and the Egr-1H , complexes , Egr-1H,4 C1 and Egr-1H4 C2 ( Fig .
5 , lane 7 ) , when added to the samples containing Tax .
This is indicative of a potentially strong interaction between Tax and both Spl and Egr-1 , in which binding of the antibody to Tax sterically interferes with their ability to bind DNA .
As a result , if all of the Spl and Egr-1 in the sample is complexed with Tax , then , no binding whatsoever should occur .
Further investigation of the physical interaction between Tax and both Spl and Egr-1 , by co-immunoprecipitation analysis , showed that Tax did , indeed , stably interact with , and bind to , both purified Spl ( Fig .
6A , lane 3 ) and purified Egr-1 ( Fig .
6B , lane 4 ) .
In addition , it was also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation analysis that Tax interacts with both 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 27420 Spl ( Fig .
7A , lane 1 ) and Egr-1 ( Fig .
7B , lane 1 ) in intact cells .
These results represent the first demonstration that Tax physically interacts with members of the zinc finger family of transcription factors .
Analysis of the ability of Tax mutants to transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter identified two Tax mutants , IEXC298 and IEXL320G , that were significantly impaired in their ability to transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter ( Fig .
8 ) .
Co-immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that Tax mutant IEXC29S8 was unable to interact with Egr-1 ( Fig .
9 , compare lane 5 versus lane 6 ) , whereas , in contrast , Tax mutant IEXL320G was able to interact with Egr-1 ( Fig .
9 , compare lane 5 versus lane 7 ) .
This would suggest that an interaction between Tax and Egr-1 is necessary , but not sufficient , to support Tax-mediated transactivation of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter .
The fact that Tax mutant IEXL320G still binds to Egr-1 , but fails to transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter , is not unex-pected .
The defect in IEXL320G most likely results from a mutation in the transactivation domain of Tax .
Indeed , the presence of such a domain in Tax has been previously demonstrated ( 65 ) .
It was shown that amino acid residues 284 to 322 in the carboxyl-terminal region of Tax constituted a functional transactivation domain .
Similar mutations of the same amino acid residues in Tax have been reported to be defective in transactivation of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat by Tax , but have been shown to still be able to interact with CREB and the HTLV-1 21-bp repeats to assemble ternary Tax-CREB-DNA complexes ( 66 ) .
As mentioned above , Tax is able to increase the DNA binding activity of a wide variety of eukaryotic transcription factors .
Perhaps the best characterized of these is the basic region-leucine zipper ( bZIP ) DNA-binding domain family , which includes members of the CREB/ATF protein family .
Dimerization is essential for bZIP proteins to bind DNA .
Consequently , it was demonstrated that Tax stimulated the DNA binding activities of CREB/ATF proteins both quantitatively and qualitatively ( 67-69 ) .
First , it was shown that Tax enhanced dimer-ization , thereby increasing the overall level of DNA binding .
Second , Tax altered DNA-binding site selectivity .
Several reports then demonstrated that Tax was able to physically interact with several members of the CREB/ATF protein family ( 66 , 70 , 71 ) .
A more recent report demonstrated that the physical interaction between the bZIP protein , CREB , and Tax to form a Tax-CREB-DNA ternary complex involves the incorporation of Tax into the ternary complex as a dimer .
In addition , the ability of Tax to form a dimer was shown to be necessary for its interaction with CREB ( 72 ) .
It has not escaped our attention that Tax 's interactions with bZIP proteins deals exclusively with the ability of both Tax , and the bZIP protein , to dimerize .
When one considers the situation involving the interaction ( s ) between Tax and members of the zinc finger family of transcription factors , the fact that zinc finger transcription factors do not normally dimerize prior to DNA binding , or , that dimerization is not essential for their DNA binding activity , immediately becomes apparent .
The results presented in this article support the possibility of the existence of an additional , as yet uncharacterized , pathway of transactivation by Tax involving members of the zinc finger family of transcription factors .
Several questions as to the exact nature of this interaction between Tax and zinc finger family transcription factors still remain to be answered .
First , and foremost , the issue of whether Tax dimerization is necessary for engaging in interactions with zinc finger transcription factors will have to be addressed .
In addition , a more detailed analysis of the domains within Tax that are responsible for interacting with the various zinc finger family transcription factor HTLV-1 Tax Interacts with Sp1 and Egr-1 members will need to be undertaken .
Experiments are currently underway to address these and other aspects of the Tax-mediated transactivation of the c-sis/PDGF-B proto-oncogene .
