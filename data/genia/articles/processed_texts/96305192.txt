Activation Protein 1-Dependent Transcriptional Activation of Interleukin 2 Gene by Ca `` */Calmodulin Kinase Type IV /Gr By Nga Ho , * Martin and Talal Chatila* From the *Division of Immunology /Rheumatology , Department of Pediatrics , and the Center for Immunology , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri ; and the *Department of Cell and Molecular Biology , University of Umeda , $ -901-87 , Umed , Sweden Summary The Ca**/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) type IV/Gr is selectively expressed in T lymphocytes and is activated after signaling via the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , indicating that it mediates some of the Ca**-dependent transcriptional events that follow TCR en-gagement .
Here we show that CaMKIV/Gr induces the transcription factor activation protein 1 ( AP-1 ) alone or in synergy with T cell mitogens and with the p21 `` oncoprotein .
CaMKIV/ Gr signaling is associated with transcriptional activation of c-fos but is independent of p21 `` or calcineurin .
AP-1 is an integral component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) transcriptional complex , which is required for interleukin 2 gene expression in T cells We demonstrate that CaMKIV/Gr reconstitutes the capacity of the cytosolic component of NFAT to direct transcription from NFAT sites in non-T cells .
These results reveal a central role for CaMKIV/Gr as a Ca**-regulated activator of gene transcription in T lymphocytes .
Ca2+ signaling pathways play a particularly important role in lymphocyte biology .
Elevation of free intracellular Ca # * concentrations after engagement of lymphocyte antigen receptors is required for a broad array of events in the course of lymphocyte development and activation .
These include positive and negative selection of developing lymphocytes , induction of lymphocyte proliferation and lymphokine gene expression , and activation-induced cell death .
Previous studies have identified the Ca**/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin as an important mediator of Ca** signaling in lymphocytes ( 1 , 2 ) .
Calcineurin is critical for the induction of lymphokine gene expression in response to T cell mitogens , and its inhibition by the immunosuppressive agents cyclosporin and FK506 leads to the suppression of lymphokine gene transcription ( 3 ) .
In addition to calcineurin , lymphocytes express other Ca `` */calmodulin-binding proteins , prominent among which are the multifunctional Ca # */calmodulin-dependent protein kinases ( CaMKs ) !

These serine/threonine-specific protein kinases , which include CaMKI , H , and IV/Gr , have ' Abbreviations used in this paper : AP-1 , activation protein 1 ; CaMK , Ca**/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ; mutants : constitutively active CaMKII-y3 ; CaMKIV/Gr @ i ) , inactive CaMKIV/Gr ; CaMKIV/ Gr { wt ) , wild-type CaMKIV/Gr ; ACaMKIV/Gr ( c ) , constitutively active CaMKIV/Gr ; ACaMKIV/Gr ( i ) , double mutant constitutive/inactive ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ; NFAT c , cytosolic component of NFAT ; NFAT , nuclear factor of activated T cells .
broad substrate specificity and serve to regulate a wide array of cellular processes ( 4 ) .
Of these enzymes , CaMKIV/Gr is of special interest in that its expression is largely restricted to T lymphocytes and neurons ( 5 , 6 ) .
CaMKIV/Gr is the product of a single gene and is expressed in tissues as two monomeric isoforms , both of which share a domain structure common to other CaMKs and that includes a catalytic domain , a calmodulin-binding domain , and an associative domain ( 7-10 ) .
Previous studies have documented the presence of CaMKIV/Gr in the nucleus ( 11 , 12 ) , and the kinase has been shown to phosphorylate and transactivate the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein ( 12-15 ) , establishing a role for CaMKIV/Gr as a Ca**-dependent transcriptional regulator .
In T lymphocytes , CaMKIV/Gr is selectively enriched in the CD4* subpopulation .
When isolated from resting T cells it exhibits minimal catalytic activity even in the presence of Ca** and calmodulin .
Its activity is strongly upregulated upon antigen receptor stimulation ( 6 , 16 , 17 ) by a mechanism involving a protein kinase cascade ( 17 , 18 ) .
This indicated that CaMKIV/Gr may play a role in Ca**-dependent transcriptional events triggered by antigen receptor signaling that are critical to the helper functions of T cells , namely the production of lymphokines .
In this study , we examined the capacity of CaMKIV/Gr to activate lymphokine gene transcription using the IL-2 promoter as a model .
Our results demonstrate that CaMKIV/Gr plays an important role in promoting IL-2 gene transcription , in part 101 J. Exp .

( 20 ) , CaMKII ( c ) .
It is an isoform of CaMKII that is expressed in several tissues , including human T lymphocytes .
CaMKII ( c ) binds to and its constitutive activity is upregulated by Ca**/calmodulin , and it was used in our studies as a kinase specificity control .
The characteristics of recombinant CaMKIV/Gr and CaMKII ( c ) proteins are illustrated in Fig .

We next examined the expression of CaMK constructs in transfected Jurkat cells by immunoblotting and/or calmodulin overlay assays .
Fig .
2 A demonstrates that both CaMKIV/Gr { ( wt ) and CaMKIV/Gr ( i ) were expressed as two monomeric « /B bands with molecular masses of 58 and 60 kD , respectively .
ACaMKIV/Gr ( c ) was expressed as two bands migrating with molecular masses of 40 and 42 kD .
The latter band represents an autophosphorylated form of the 40-kD species ( Chatila , T. , unpublished observations ) .
ACaMKIV/Gr ( i ) was expressed at lower levels as a single 40-kD band .
In separate studies , we established that three independent inactivating mutations all resulted in decreased expression of ACaMKIV/Gr ( c ) , indicating that the low level of expression of ACaMKIV/Gr ( i ) in Jurkat cells reflects a requirement for an autophosphorylation event to stabilize this mutant ( Chatila , T. , and A.R .
Means , manuscript in preparation ) .
We have also determined that when expressed at levels comparable with those of ACaMKIV/ Gr ( i ) , the constitutively active kinase mutant exhibited activity equivalent to ~15 % of that found with unrestricted ACaMKIV/Gr ( c ) expression .
In some experiments ( e.g .
, Fig .

Activation of AP-1-dependent Transcription by CaMKIV/ Gr .
Ca** signaling pathways have previously been implicated in the activation of AP-1 in T lymphocytes by mechanisms that include transcriptional activation of c-fos ( 34 ) and posttranscriptional activation of a c-Jun kinase termed JNK or stress-activated protein kinase ( 35 , 36 ) .
To determine the capacity of CaMKIV/Gr to activate AP-1-dependent transcription , Jurkat cells were transiently cotransfected with the respective CaMKIV/Gr construct together with an AP-1-responsive luciferase reporter gene , and the cells were subsequently examined for luciferase activity .
Fig .
3 A demonstrates that transfection of Jurkat cells with a construct encoding CaMKIV/Gr { ( wt ) resulted in an eightfold upregulation of luciferase activity .
Furthermore , transfection of a cDNA construct encoding a constitutively active form of the kinase resulted in 50-fold induction of luciferase activity .
Significantly , both wild-type and the constitutively active kinase mutant acted in synergy with the phorbol ester PMA and with the TCR-stimulating lectin PHA to upregulate the induction of AP-1 reporter gene expression ( Fig .
3 B ) .
In contrast , inactive CaMKIV/Gr mutants derived from the wild-type and constitutively active kinase species failed to induce the transcription of the AP-1 reporter or to enhance PMA or PHA-induced reporter gene expression .
The multifunctional CaMKII is similar to CaMKIV/Gr in that both are homologous , Ca**+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases that exhibit broad substrate specificity and that phosphorylate the same minimal consensus substrate sequence ( RXXS/T ) ( 4 ) .
We therefore examined the capacity of CaMKII ( c ) for its capacity to induce AP-1 .
We found that CaMKII ( c ) failed to induce AP-1 activation in transfected Jurkat cells ( Fig .
3 A ) or to upregulate induction by phorbol esters and PHA of AP-1 reporter expression ( Fig .
3 B ) .
Other reports have documented moderate inhibition of AP-1 activation by CaMKII ( c ) ( 37 , 38 ) .
The specificity of CaMKIV/Gr induction of AP-1 reporter gene expression was also ascertained by the failure of ACaMKIV/ Gr ( c ) to upregulate the transcription of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the CMV immediate early gene promoter or to enhance the upregulation of the CMV promoter activity by PMA and PHA ( Fig .
3 C ) .
Induction of AP-1-dependent transcription by CaMKIV/ Gr was associated with increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays performed using a radiolabeled AP-1-binding oligonucleotide probe revealed enhanced AP-1 DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts of ACaMKIV/Gr ( c ) -transfected Jurkat cells as compared with those extracts isolated from cells transfected with vector alone or with ACaMKIV/Gr ( i ) ( Fig .
4 ) .
The increase in AP-1 DNA-binding activity by ACaMKIV/Gr { ( c ) was less than that observed upon treatment of Jurkat cells with PMA .
This can be explained in part by the low number of Jurkat cells successfully transfected with ACaMKIV/ Gr ( c ) ( typically 20-30 % ) as compared with 100 % of cells being amenable to PMA treatment .

Jurkat Tag cells were transiently cotransfected with 5 pug of AP-1-luciferase reporter gene together with 30 jug of empty pSGS5 vector ( Vector ) or pSGS5 encoding wild-type CaMKIV/Gr ( CaMKIV/Grfwt ] ) , inactive CaMKIV/ Gr ( CaMKIV/Grfif ) , constitutively active CaMKIV/Gr ( ACaMKIV/ Grfc ] ) , double mutant constitutive/inactive ( ACaMKIV/Grfi } } ) , or a constitutively active CaMKII-yg mutant ( CaMKIIfc ] ) .

Previous studies have demonstrated that p21 `` ®-regulated signaling pathway ( s ) are involved in TCR coupling to AP-1 activation ( 39 ) .
To examine the potential role of p21'® in CaMKIV/Gr-dependent induction of AP-1 , we monitored AP-1 activity in Jurkat cells cotransfected with CaMKIV/ Gr and either a mutationally activated or a dominant negative p21 `` ® mutant .
Fig .
5 A demonstrates that CaMKIV/Gr acted in synergy with activated p21 ' `` ® , encoded by v-Ha-ras , in inducing AP-1-dependent transcription .
This result agrees with the data shown in Fig .
3 B since both PHA and PMA have been shown to convert p21 `` to its active , GTP-bound state and thereby activate p21'®*-coupled pathways .
However , Fig .
5 B demonstrates that CaMKIV/Gr induced AP-1 activation by mechanism ( s ) that were largely independent of p21 `` since cotransfection of the dominant negative p21 `` mutant Ha-ras-N17 resulted in only modest inhibition ( < 20 % in three independent experiments ) .
In contrast , and in agreement with previous studies , the Ha-ras-N17 mutant inhibited the induction of AP-1 activity by PMA by ~85 % .
A possible mechanism by which Ca** signaling pathways may activate AP-1 is through induction of c-fos transcription ( 34 ) .
The capacity of CaMKIV/Gr to activate c-fos transcription was examined by cotransfecting kinase derivatives and a reporter gene regulated by the c-fos enhancer/ g. € .

Fig .
5 D dem- __ activation of NFAT ' c in the nucleus is thought to reflect onstrates that this was not the case , since AP-1 activation __ the action of two signaling pathways : ( a ) a Ca**+-dependent by CaMKIV/Gr is cyclosporin A resistant , whereas the _ pathway involving the Ca**/calmodulin-dependent phos-drug , as expected , blocks PHA induction of a NFAT- phatase calcineurin and mediating NFAT ' c translocation to 106 Ca** Signaling Pathways in T Lymphocytes the nucleus ( 43 ) ; and ( b ) a PKC- and p21®-dependent pathway mediating activation of AP-1 ( 44 ) .
To determine if AP-~1 activation by CaMKIV/Gr is associated with increased NFAT activity , we examined if CaMKIV/Gr modulates basal and mitogen-activated transcription from a NFAT-driven repoter gene transfected into Jurkat cells .
Fig .
6 A demonstrates that CaMKIV/Gr upregulated the activation of NFAT -dependent transcription by PMA and the Ca # * ionophore ionomycin .
In contrast , and in agreement with previous studies ( 37 , 38 ) , the constitutively active CaMKII ( c ) moderately inhibited NFAT activation under the same conditions .
The observed synergy between CaMKIV/Gr and ionomycin in inducing NFAT-dependent transcription is of interest since it suggests synergistic interaction between calcinuerin , which mediates NFAT ' c translocation to the nucleus , and CaMKIV/Gr , which activates AP-1 .
This interpretation is in agreement with the previously reported capacity of transfected AP~1 compo-nents , especially c-fos , to promote NFAT activation by ionomycin in Jurkat cells ( 21 ) .
In line with the activation of NFAT-driven transcription , CaMKIV/Gr also enhanced the transcriptional activation by PMA and ionomycin of a reporter gene driven by the complete IL-2 enhancer/promoter and transfected into Jurkat cells .
This effect was more pronounced in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of PMA , in agreement with the synergistic induction of AP-1 by PMA and CaMKIV/ Gr ( Fig .

108 Ca** Signaling Pathways in T Lymphocytes driven reporter gene expression .
This induction was most likely mediated by endogenous NFAT proteins normally found in B cells and was abrogated upon treatment with cyclosporin A ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , cotransfection of of BJAB cells with constructs encoding ACaMKIV/ Gr ( c ) and NFATc resulted in the activation of NFAT-driven reporter gene expression to levels 25-fold higher than those obtained with NFAT ' c alone in the presence of PMA and 10-fold higher than those induced upon transfection of BJAB cells with CaMKIV/Gr ( c ) alone .
Induction of the NFAT reporter gene expression by NFATc and ACaMKIV/Gr ( c ) was further upregulated by PMA by about twofold , which is consistent with the observed synergy between PMA/Ras and CaMKIV/Gr in upregulating AP-1 function ( Figs .
3 and 5 ) .
The results obtained in BJAB cells were reproduced in the human adenocarcinoma cell line Hela .
Fig .
8 C demonstrates that a construct encoding NFAT ' c was ineffective in activating transcription of the NFAT reporter gene in HeLa cells .
Similarly , transfection of a construct encoding ACaMKIV/Gr ( c ) failed to activate NFAT -driven reporter gene expression .
In contrast , cotransfection of HeLa cells with constructs encoding ACaMKIV/Gr ( c ) and NFATc resulted in vigorous activation of NFAT reporter gene expression .
Induction of the NFAT reporter gene expression by NFAT ' c and ACaMKIV/Gr ( c ) was further upregulated by PMA , similar to what was observed with BJAB cells .
The validity of these results was extended to an IL-2 enhancer/promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene , where ACaMKIV/Gr ( c ) was found to synergize with NFATc to drive the transcription of this reporter in both BJAB and Hela cells ( Fig .
8 , B and D ) .
The specificity of CaMKIV/Gr stimulation of NFAT ' c activity in BJAB and HeLa cells was suggested by the failure of CaMKII ( c ) to activate transcription of the analyzed reporter genes ( Fig .
8 ) .
To analyze the mechanism ( s ) by which CaMKIV/Gr { ( c ) synergized with NFAT ' c in inducing NFAT and IL-2 reporter gene expression in non-T cells , we examined nuclear extracts derived from transfected HeLa cells for the presence of NFAT DNA-binding activity using an oligonucleotide corresponding to the distal NFAT site in the murine IL-2 promoter .
This oligonucleotide binds to NFAT proteins both in the absence and in the presence of associated AP-1 components to give rise to two distinct DNA-protein complexes that can be resolved on PAGE : a faster migrating complex containing NFAT and a slower complex containing NFAT/AP-1 ( 33 ) .
Fig .
9 demonstrates that nuclear extracts of HeLa cells that have been transfected with empty vectors alone exhibited no NFAT -specific DNA-protein complexes .
Transfection with NFAT ' c induced the appearance of two NFAT -specific complexes : a dominant , higher mobility complex ( Fig .
9 , arrow ) and a minor slower moving complex ( Fig .
9 , arrowhead ) .
The presence of these complexes was not inhibited by cyclosporin A , indicating that recombinant NFATc gained entry into nuclei of un-stimulated HeLa cells by a calcineurin-independent mechanism ( data not shown ) .
Transfection of CaMKIV/Gr ( c ) induced no demonstrable NFAT -specific binding activity .

Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells that had been transiently transfected with the indicated construct ( s ) as detailed in the legend to Fig .
8 .
5 jg of the respective extract was incubated with *°P-labeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the murine IL-2 distal NFAT site in the absence or presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled NFAT , AP-1 , or mutant AP-1 ( mAP1 ) competitor oligonucleotide , as indicated .

( Arrowhead ) DNA complexes containing NFAT proteins together with AP-1 ; ( arrow ) complexes containing NFAT proteins .
The bottom two bands represents nonspecific DNA-protein complex , while unbound radiolabeled probe was allowed to run out of the gel .
Results are representative of five independent experiments .
contrast , cotransfection of both NFATc and CaMKIV/Gr { ( c ) resulted in marked increase in the upper complex , consistent with the induction of AP-1 activity by CaMKIV/Gr .
It also resulted in some increase in the abundance of the lower complex , consistent with either enhanced transport of NFATc into the nucleus and/or increased retention .
The specificity of NFAT-DNA complexes was ascertained by the capacity of excess unlabeled NFAT-binding oligonucleotide to competitively inhibit both NFAT-DNA complexes .
Addition of excess unlabeled AP-1-binding oligonucleotide specifically inhibited the upper complex , consistent with the presence of AP-1 in that complex , whereas mutant AP-1-binding oligonucleotide , which exhibits poor affinity to AP-1 , inhibited neither complex .
These results indicated that the effects of CaMKIV/Gr { ( c ) on NFAT -driven transcription could be accounted for , at least in part , by the capacity of the kinase to activate AP-1 expression .
Discussion The present study establishes the role of CaMKIV/Gr as a transducer of Ca**-dependent activation signals in T lymphocytes .
CaMKIV/Gr upregulates NFAT and IL-2 enhancer/promoter-dependent transcription in T cells and , importantly , reconstitutes the capacity of NFAT ' c to direct transcription from the respective regulatory sequence in non-T cells The promotion by CaMKIV/Gr of NFAT and IL-2 enhancer/promoter-dependent transcription is due in part to the induction by the kinase of the transcription factor AP-1 .
This is the first example of AP-1 activation by a CaMK , and the results herein provide a novel mechanism by which Ca** signaling upregulates AP~1 function .
CaMKIV/Gr induces AP-1 in part by activating the transcription of genes encoding AP-1 components .
This is supported by the demonstration that CaMKIV/Gr upregulates the transcription in Jurkat cells of a reporter gene driven by the c-fos promoter/enhancer and by the demonstration that CaMKIV/Gr induces the transcription of c-fos in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells .
CaMKIV/Gr induction of c-fos transcription proceeds by a serum response factor-dependent mechanism in contrast to induction by p21'® , which is mediated by the serum response factor-associated protein Elk-1 ( 45 ) .
This illustrates how CaMKIV/Gr and p21 `` ® can act independently yet synergistically to upregulate AP-1 function .
It remains to be determined whether CaMKIV/Gr activates transcription of genes encoding other AP-1 components and whether it additionally upregulates AP-1 activity by a posttranscriptional mechanism .
Consistent with its induction of AP-1 , CaMKIV/Gr upregulated the activation by mitogens of NFAT-dependent transcription in Jurkat cells .
It also synergized with recombinant NFAT ' c in promoting NFAT -dependent transcription in BJAB and HeLa cells .
In the latter case , NFAT ' c gained entry into the nucleus in the absence of a Ca**-mobilizing signal .
This probably resulted from overexpression of NFATc in the cytosol leading to its transport into the nucleus in a calcineurin-independent manner .
Whereas AP~-1 induction provides an important mechanism underlying the activation of IL-2 transcription by CaMKIV/Gr , additional kinase-induced activation events may also be involved .
This is indicated by the finding that CaMKIV/Gr greatly surpassed PMA in activating transcription of NFAT and IL-2 enhancer/promoter-driven reporter genes in non-T cells .
An effect on NFAT ' c itself is possible , suggested by the observation that CaMKIV/Gr increased NFAT DNA-binding activity in the nucleus .
It should be noted that NFATc ( 26 ) and its related factors NFAT ( 46 ) , NFATc3 ( 47 ) , and NFAT-X ( 48 ) contain numerous consensus phosphorylation sites for CaMKIV/Gr and CaMKII .
The role of these phosphorylation sites in positive and negative regulation of NFAT protein function remains to be determined .
It is likely that activation of NFAT -dependent transcription in T cells is a cooperative process between several signaling pathways and that it involves calcineurin , CaMKIV/ Gr , and PKC- and p21 `` ®-dependent pathways .
However , unlike the aforementioned transducers of TCR signaling , CaMKIV/Gr is distinguished by its selective expression in T cells , particularly the CD4* subset ( 6 ) .
This and the capacity of CaMKIV/Gr to activate transcription from lymphokine response elements suggests that the kinase may be an important determinant of the type and level of expression of lymphokine genes present in T versus B cells and possibly among different T cell populations .
In contrast to the salutary effects of CaMKIV/Gr on transcription directed from lymphokine regulatory ele-ments , the multifunctional CaMKII-yp inhibits transcription from these same elements .
It has been suggested that CaMKII may play a role in mediating negative effects of Ca** signaling in lymphocytes , including anergy and negative selection ( 37 , 38 ) .
However , the outcome of Ca** signaling in a particular T lymphocyte is more likely to be determined by a complex set of interactions between the various Ca**-responsive enzymes , including CaMKIV/Gr , CaMKII , and calcineurin .
The contribution of each of these enzymes to the diverse effects of Ca** signaling in T lymphocytes remains to be fully mapped .
