The c-Jun 6-Domain Inhibits Neuroendocrine Promoter Activity in a DNA Sequence- and Pituitary-specific Manner* ( Received for publication , March 25 , 1996 , and in revised form , May 2 , 1996 ) Kathryn N. Farrow , Nicole Manning , Fred Schaufele ?
, and Arthur Gutierrez-Hartmann§ From the Department of Medicine , the Department of Biochemistry , Biophysics and Genetics , the Program in Molecular Biology , and the Colorado Cancer Center , University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , Denver , Colorado 80262 and the { Metabolic Research Unit HSW-1143 , University of California , San Francisco 94143-0962 The transcription and transformation activity of cJun is governed by a 27-amino acid regulatory motif , labeled the 6-domain , which is deleted in v-Jun .
We have previously shown that c-Jun is a potent inhibitor of the rat prolactin ( rPRL ) promoter activity induced by either oncogenic Ras or phorbol esters .
Here , we have characterized the structural and cell-specific requirements for this c-Jun inhibitory response , and we show that this c-Jun inhibitory response mapped to the rPRL footprint II repressor site , was pituitary-specific and required the c-Jun a-domain .
Moreover , alteration of any one of these features ( e.g .
, cis-element , trans-factor , or cell-specific background ) switched c-Jun to a transcriptional activator of the rPRL promoter .
In Hela nonpituitary cells , c-Jun alone activated the rPRL promoter via the most proximal GHF-1/Pit-1 binding site , footprint I , and synergized with GHEF-1 .
Finally , recombinant GHF-1 interacted directly with c-Jun but not c-Fos proteins .
These data provide important fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the c-Jun 6-domain functions as a modulatory switch and further imply that the functional role of c-Jun is dictated by cell-specific influences and the 6-domain motif .
c-Jun is a member of the BZip family of transcription factors , which are characterized by a basic DNA binding domain and a leucine zipper protein dimerization domain ( 1 , 2 ) .
cjun was first described as the cellular homologue of the v-Jun oncogene , and subsequently , many other BZip family members have been identified , including several Jun-like and Fos-like proteins ( 3-5 ) .
c-Jun and c-Fos can combine to form homo- and het-erodimers , with Jun-Jun homodimers and Jun-Fos het-erodimers ( also referred to as an AP-1 complex ) , binding with high affinity to the consensus DNA binding site , TGACTCA , whereas Fos-Fos homodimers are unable to stably bind to this sequence ( 1 , 6-8 ) .
Once bound to DNA , their effects are mediated through amino-terminal transactivation domains ( 9 ) .
In the cell , c-Jun serves as a downstream target for several signaling pathways , including 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-ac-etate ( TPA ) , `` a phorbol ester that activates protein kinase C ( 8 , * This research was supported by American Cancer Society Grant BE-199 .

10 ) and oncogenic Ha-Ras ( 11 , 12 ) .
TPA mediates its transcriptional effects through a TPA-responsive element , which is equivalent to the AP-1 site noted above ( 3 , 4 , 13 , 14 ) .
Stimulation of Ha-Ras leads to activation of Jun kinase , resulting in the phosphorylation of amino-terminal serines 63 and 73 in the transcription activation domain of c-Jun , thereby enhancing its transcription potency ( 15-18 ) .
Also present in the amino terminus of c-Jun , but deleted in v-Jun , is a region known as the 8-domain ( 19 ) .
This 27-amino acid region is important for cell-specific modulatory effects on transcription and transformation potency of c-Jun versus v-Jun , thought to be mediated via protein-protein interactions ( 9 , 20-23 ) .
One such 8-domain-specific interaction is with Jun kinase , which binds to the amino-terminal half of the 8-domain spanning amino acids 34-45 and phosphorylates c-Jun but not v-Jun ( 9 , 18 , 24-26 ) .
Additionally , although c-Jun typically activates gene tran-scription , examples have accumulated documenting that it can also inhibit gene expression .
A direct mode of inhibitory action was shown in the c-fos gene , where the AP-1 complex binds to the c-fos promoter to down-regulate c-fos gene expression ( 27 ) .
Alternatively , the AP-1 complex has been shown to bind to a TPA-responsive element that overlaps a critical retinoic acid response element/vitamin D response element required for os-teocalcin promoter activity , and thus sterically interferes with retinoic acid receptor/vitamin D receptor binding ( 28 ) .
In certain cases , c-Jun heterodimerizes with other activators , either via its leucine zipper motif , e.g .
with the glucocorticoid receptor ( 29 ) , or via its amino-terminal domain , e.g .
with MyoD ( 30 ) .
Indeed , the ability of c-Jun to inhibit the muscle-specific crea-tine kinase gene ( 30 ) , cardiac-specific atrial natriuretic factor gene ( 31 ) , or the liver-specific a-fetoprotein gene ( 82 ) was mapped to the amino-terminal domain of c-Jun .
In this respect , it is striking that in each case whereby c-Jun inhibits a highly specialized , tissue-specific gene , it does so via its amino-terminal domain , usually requiring just the first 87 amino acids , including the 8-domain .
One of the first indications that the 8-domain serves a regulatory function was noted in cell-free transcription studies .
Recombinant c-Jun proteins containing the 8-domain weakly activated an AP-1-driven promoter in Jun/Fos-depleted Hela cell extracts , whereas v-Jun or amino-terminal truncated c-Jun proteins , devoid of the 8-domain , were very active in this in vitro transcription assay ( 21 ) .
Importantly , all of these recombinant Jun proteins bound equally well to the TPA-responsive DNA element .
Using in vivo gene transfer methods , it was shown that in all cell lines tested , a c-Jun fusion protein with the DNA binding domain of E2 , a transcription factor from bovine papilloma virus , activated the appropriate promoter-reporter plasmid ( 9 ) .
Deletion of the 8-domain resulted in an enhancement of Jun 's activation effect in HeLa cells ( 9 ) .
However , not all tested cells revealed this differential effect of c-Jun versus v-Jun .
For example , the transcriptional activity of c-Jun 171839 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 17140 and v-Jun were the same in REF , SL2 , and F9 cells , whereas c-Jun was shown to be a better transactivator than v-Jun in CEF and HepG2 cells ( 9 , 20 , 22 ) .
While the notion that the 8-domain operates as a critical negative regulatory domain stems from the observation that simply removing the 3-domain from c-Jun results in its oncogenic activation , it has become increasingly clear that transformation and transcription potency of Jun proteins are not directly correlated and may even be inversely related ( 22 ) .
Despite this important progress in elucidating the structural features of Jun proteins , the precise rules by which the 8-domain functions remain unknown .
The prolactin and growth hormone ( GH ) genes are two an-cestrally related genes whose expression is restricted to the lactotroph and somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary , respectively ( 33 , 34 ) .
Both the ontogeny of these pituitary cells and the expression of these two pituitary-specific genes are regulated by the POU homeodomain transcription factor , GHF-1/Pit-1 ( 33 , 35 , 36 ) .
Significant insights into basal and hor-mone-activated PRL and GH gene expression have been provided by GH , rat pituitary tumor cells , which are a clonal cell line that maintains cell type-specific functions and hormonal responses ( 33 , 34 , 37-39 ) .
Previous experiments in this system have demonstrated that c-Jun does not function as a downstream target for either oncogenic V12 Ras- or TPA-mediated activation of the rPRL promoter , but instead c-Jun inhibits both of these signal transduction pathways ( 40 , 41 ) .
Yet this inhibitory effect of c-Jun on the V12 Ras- and TPA-mediated activation of the rPRL promoter is promoter-specific and not GH , cell-specific , since we demonstrated that c-Jun enhances V12 Ras stimulation of the AP-1-dependent -73ColCAT promoter-reporter construct ( 40 ) .
These results suggest that c-Jun is capable of serving multiple functions within these cells and that some of these functions are promoter-specific .
Thus , the rPRL promoter and GH , pituitary cells provide an important model system in which to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which c-Jun mediates promoter- and cell-specific effects .
The goal of the studies presented here was to dissect the mechanism of c-Jun inhibition of the rPRL promoter in GH , neuroendocrine cells .
Using transient transfection studies we showed that c-Jun selectively inhibits basal rPRL promoter via the amino-terminal c-Jun 8-domain and that this inhibition required the rPRL promoter FP II repressor-binding site and pituitary-specific influences .
Moreover , eliminating any one of these elements switched Jun function on the rPRL promoter to an activator .
These data provide critical and novel insights into the regulatory functions of the c-Jun 8-domain and further imply that the precise functional role of c-Jun is dictated by the potential interaction of cell-specific factors with the 8-domain motif .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plasmid Constructs-The pituitary promoter-luciferase constructs , pA , PRLluc-425 , pA , rGHlue , and pA , halue-1760 have been described ( 39 , 42 , 48 ) .
The -255 , -189 , -125 , -54 , and -36 rPRL promoter deletions were prepared in pGT7PRL by 5° exonuclease digestion , sub-cloned into SaZl/HindlIII-cut pA ; lue , and verified by dideoxy sequencing , and they will be described in detail elsewhere . ``
The site-specific mutants in FP I ( pA , Allue ) , FP II ( pA , A2luc ) , and FP II together with a loop-out deletion of the -112 to -80 basal transcription element ( BTE ) region ( pA , A2 , Dluc ) were constructed in the -425 to +78 rPRL promoter as described previously ( 89 , 43 ) .
The FP IFP III double mutant ( pA , A1 , S3lue ) was constructed in the -425 to +73 rPRL promoter as described previously ( 45 ) .

The plasmid pe-fosTKluc contains two copies of the c-fos enhancer spanning -857 to -276 fused to the TK promoter -200 to +70 and has been previously described ( 48 ) .
The plasmid pCMVlue was kindly provided by Dr. Mike Smith ( University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , Denver , CO ) .
Plasmids pRSV-lue400 and pA , SV4O0luec have been previously described ( 45 , 49 ) .
Plasmids pGem4 and pGem7 were both obtained from Promega Corp. ( Madison , WI ) .
Plasmid DNAs were purified either by alkaline-SDS extraction followed by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation ( 50 ) or according to the Qiagen Mega protocol ( Qiagen Inc. , Chatsworth , CA ) .
Plasmids were quantitated by both absorbance at 260 nm and by comparison with DNA standards on agarose electrophoresis ( 50 ) .
No significant difference was observed in transfection results using plasmids prepared by the two different purification methods .
Cell Culture , Electroporation , and Luciferase Assay-GH , T2 rat pituitary tumor cells and Hela human cervical carcinoma cells were grown in 5 % CO , at 37 °C in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) and 50 ug/ml of penicillin and streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) .
Cells were transfected via electroporation , keeping the total amount of DNA constant with pGEMT7 or pGEM4 DNA , and pRSV -globin was used to control for nonspecific effects of RSV expression vectors ( 87 ) .
Electroporations were performed in triplicate for each condition within a single experiment , and experiments were repeated using different plasmid preparations of each construct .
Cells were harvested at 24 h after transfection unless otherwise stated , cell extracts were prepared , and luciferase assays were performed as described previously ( 87 ) .
Luciferase light units of the control value were set to 1 , and the data was expressed as -fold stimulation relative to control .
All data was expressed as the mean + S.E .
for replicated experiments .
Since c-Jun expression modulated the activity of each of the various viral promoters typically used to drive a B-galactosidase reporter , those B-galactosidase vectors could not be used as internal controls for transfection efficiency ( see Fig .
2 ) .
Previously , we have found that by repeating the various transfections multiple times and applying statistical analysis to the resultant data , we are able to achieve consistency of agreement that is equal to or better than using an internal control reporter vector ( 37-39 , 42 , 43 ) .
Western Blot Analysis-GH , cells transiently transfected with the rPRL promoter-reporter and various effector plasmids were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline with 3 mM EDTA .
GH , cells were lysed by sonication using five 10-s pulses on ice in 300 pl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES , pH 7.9 , 0.42 m KCI , 1.5 mm MgCl , , 25 % glycerol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 0.15 mM spermine , 0.5 mM spermidine , 0.5 % Triton X-100 and 0.45 mg/ml Boehringer Mannheim protease inhibitor set .
After sonication , cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C .
HeLa cells transiently transfected with the rPRL promoter reporter and various effector plasmids were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mM EDTA .
Cells were lysed with three sequential freeze-thaw cycles in 100 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7.8 , and 1 mM dithiothreitol .
Vortexing ensured cell lysis .
The cells were spun down at 10,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet unlysed cells and cell debris .
The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay .
Equal amounts of total cellular protein ( 100 ug ) were resolved on an SDS-10 % polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose in 192 mM glycine , 25 mM Tris , 10 % methanol at 100 mA for 16 h. Membranes were blocked overnight with 7.5 % nonfat dried milk in 20 mm Tris-Cl ( pH 7.4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 0.2 % Tween 20 .
The membranes were then probed with a rabbit polyclonal c-Jun antibody directed against amino acids 95-105 ( Santa Cruz Biotech ; Santa Cruz , CA ) , a rabbit polyclonal GHF-1 antibody directed against amino acids 214-230 ( BabCO ; Richmond , CA ) , or a mouse monoclonal actin antibody , clone C4 ( Boehringer Mannheim ) in a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer with 1 % dried milk .
The membranes were extensively washed and developed with a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase ( Life Technol-ogies ) , using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Life Sciences Inc .
Between probes with different antibodies , the nitrocellulose membranes were stripped by incubation at 50 °C for 30 min in a solution of 0.7 % B-mercaptoethanol , 2 % ( w/v ) SDS , 62.5 mm Tris , pH 6.8 .
After stripping , the membranes were reblocked overnight , and the membrane was then reprobed as described above .
In Vitro Protein Binding Studies-The protein A/GHF-1 fusion ( pA/ GHF-1 ) vector was constructed by filling in , with Klenow polymerase , the Neo !

site and the Nof ] site is 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 6-Domain-dependent Switching of c-Jun Activity downstream of the stop codon .
The blunt-ended fragment was inserted into the Smal site of the pA vector , Rit 32 ( a modification of the Rit 2 vector ) ( 51 ) .
The amino-terminal start codon of GHF-1 is thus fused , in frame , to the carboxyl tail of protein A .
The pA and pA/GHF-1 vectors were transformed into N4830-1 bacteria ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc. ) grown in 500 ml of Luria broth ( LB ) at 30 °C until the Ag , , = 0.6 and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-l-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside and increasing the temperature to 42 °C by the addition of 500 ml of LB at 55 °C ; the N48830-1 bacteria used to grow the pA and pA/GHF-1 constructs contain a temperature-sensitive A cl repressor which , with the Lac repressor , regulates the Rit32 promoter .
The pA- and pA/GHF-1-expressing cells were collected 45 min after induction , since pA/GHF-1 expression was quite toxic to the cells .
Bacterial cell pellets were resuspended with 7-8 ml of TST ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7.5 , 150 mm NaCl , 0.05 % Tween 20 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 5 ug/ml each of the protease inhibitors antipain , chymostatin , leupeptin , and pepstatin A ) and lysed by sonication , and the debris was pelleted for 20 min at 15,000 rpm in an S834 rotor .
The pA- and pA/GHF-l-containing lysates were then passed over 0.5 ml of IgG-agarose ( Sigma ) columns , washed twice with 5 ml of TST and then twice with 5 ml of buffer A ( 25 mm Hepes , pH 7.9 , 80 mM KCl , 6 mm MgCl , , 10 % glycerol , 1 mm dithiothreitol , and protease inhibitors listed above ) .
The beads were then resuspended with 1.5 ml of buffer A and stored at 4 °C .
Efficient production of either fusion protein was assessed by boiling approximately 10 pl of packed beads in SDS sample loading buffer , loading onto an SDS-10 % polyacrylamide gel and staining with Coomassie Blue .
Reticulocyte lysates ( Promega ) were programmed with RNA transcribed by T7 polymerase , resulting in either human c-Jun , rat c-Fos , or rat GHF-1 protein labeled with [ *°S ] Met ( DuPont NEN ) .
Efficiency of labeling was assessed by electrophoresing 1 l of each sample on an SDS protein gel followed by autoradiography .
Roughly equivalent amounts of each radiolabeled protein ( 2-5 pl of each programmed reticulocyte lysate ) were incubated with about 5 pl of packed pA or pA/GHF-1 beads in 100 wl of buffer A containing 0.05 % Nonidet P-40 and 200 pg/ml ethidium bromide ( 52 ) for 1.5 h at 4°C with gentle rocking in an Eppendorf tube .
Unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate was added to each incubation so that all incubations were done with the same amount of lysate .
Following incubation , the beads were pelleted , the supernatant removed , and the pellet was washed six additional times each with 170 ul of buffer A , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 .
To each pellet or input sample was added 15 pl of SDS gel loading buffer .
The samples were boiled and loaded onto an SDS 83 % stacking , 10 % resolving polyacrylamide gel , the signal was enhanced with `` Amplify `` ( Amersham ) , and the gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography .
RESULTS c-Jun Selectively Inhibits the rPRL Promoter in a Dose-responsive Fashion-Since c-Jun has previously been shown to inhibit basal rPRL promoter activity ( 41 ) , we first tested whether this effect was dose-responsive on the rPRL promoter in GH , cells .
As shown in Fig .
14 , c-Jun produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the -425-base pair rPRL promoter reaching 58 % inhibition at a dose of 20 ug of pRSVce-jun .
Although the inhibitory effect of c-Jun is modest , it is very reproducible and statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
Also , similar doses of pRSVc-jun inhibited a -2.5 kilobase pair rPRL promoter construct , containing the distal enhancer ( data not shown ) .
The maximal dose of pRSVc-jun , 20 ug , was then used in all further studies .
The inhibition of the -425 rPRL promoter by c-Jun reached 50 % by 12 h post-transfection and remained constant from 12 to 24 h post-transfection , with maximal inhibition reaching 77 % at 36 h post-transfection ( data not shown ) .
In order to ensure that the transiently transfected c-Jun expression vector resulted in detectable levels of c-Jun protein in GH , cells , we performed Western blot analysis .
As shown in Fig .
1B , control ( Zane 1 ) and mock-transfected ( Zane 2 ) GH , cells did not appear to have detectable levels endogenous c-Jun , whereas transfection of pRSVc-jun resulted in readily detectable levels of c-Jun protein ( Zane 3 ) .
The same blot was reprobed with an anti-GHF-1 antibody in order to verify that the proteins in the cellular extract loaded in Zanes 1-3 were equivalent and intact .

A , c-Jun dose response .
Exponentially growing GH , rat pituitary tumor cells were transiently transfected by electroporation in triplicate with 3 pg of pA , PRLIluc-425 and with or without 2 , 5 , 10 , 15 , or 20 ug of pRSVe-jun .
An equal amount of pRSV -globin was added to control for nonspecific promoter effects as well as to maintain total DNA equivalent in all transfections as described under `` Experimental Pro-cedures . ``
The fold basal rPRL promoter activity was calculated by dividing the mean total light units in the presence of pRSVc-jun by the mean total light units in the presence of pRSV -globin alone .
Different plasmid preparations were used for separate experiments .
Data are expressed as the mean -fold + S.E .
for three transfections done in triplicate , and specific comparisons of the means were conducted by Student 's £ test .
The results for DNA doses of 5 and 20 were significant to p < 0.05 , and 10 and 15 were significant to p < 0.01 .
B , c-Jun Western blot .
Equal amounts ( 100 ug ) of cell protein from transfected GH , cells were electrophoresed on a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose .
The membrane was probed with e-Jun/ AP-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody and detected using Amersham ECL with a 5-min exposure .
The membrane was stripped and reprobed with GHF-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody and detected using Amersham ECL with a 30-min exposure .

were equivalent ( Fig .
1B , lanes 4-6 ) .
Also , c-Jun expression had no effect on GHF-1 protein levels , indicating that the negative effect of c-Jun on the rPRL promoter was not due to a decrease in endogenous GHF-1 protein levels .
To determine whether the inhibition of the rPRL promoter was promoter-specific , the effect of c-Jun was examined on a variety of pituitary and nonpituitary promoters in GH , cells .
As shown in Fig .
2 , c-Jun inhibited the -425 rPRL promoter and the -2.5 kilobase pair rPRL promoter 54 and 34 % , respectively .
Likewise , the pituitary-specific growth hormone promoter was also inhibited by c-Jun to 53 % of its basal activity .
However , c-Jun was not a general inhibitor of pituitary promoters as evidenced by its 1.7-fold stimulation of the human glycoprotein a-subunit promoter .
Also , c-Jun stimulated the c-fosTK promoter , containing a consensus AP-1 binding site , by 1.9-fold .
The effects of c-Jun on several viral promoters in the GH , cells also varied , with the CMV promoter inhibited 45 % by c-Jun , whereas the SV40 and RSV promoters were stimulated 2.1- and 2.4-fold , respectively .
The effect of c-Jun on the promoterless pA ; luc reporter vector , used as the parental reporter was minimal .
These data indicate that the c-Jun inhibition was promoter-selective for rPRL , rGH , and CMV and that the neg- 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 17142 Relative Promoter Activity H1 bd 3 wo ls ¢§°w5 > m § ?

2. c-Jun differentially modulates various pituitary and viral promoters in GH , pituitary cells .
GH , cells were transfected with 5 ug of pA , PRLluc-425 , p2.5kbPRLlue , prGHlue , pHeluc-1760 , pe-fosTKlue , pCMVlue , pSV40luc , pA , RSVluc400 , or pA , lue with either 20 ug of -globin or pRSVe-jun .
-Fold activation was determined relative to the basal activity of each individual promoter construct .
Data are expressed as mean -fold + S.E .
of eight transfections for pA , PRLluc-425 , six transfections for p2.5kbPRLIluc , four transfections for prGHlue , three transfections for pHaluc-1760 , two transfections for pe-fosTKlue , five transfections for pCMVluc , five transfections for pSV40luc , three transfections of pRSVluc400 , and three transfections for pA , lue .
Each experiment consisted of transfections performed in triplicate .
The inhibitory effects of c-Jun on both the -425 and the -2.5 kilobase pair rPRL promoters were significant to p < 0.01 , whereas the effect of c-Jun on the parental pA , lue vector was not statistically significant compared with untreated .
ative effect was not mediated by DNA sequences in the pAglue vector background .
c-Jun Inhibition Maps to the FP II Region of the rPRL Pro-moter-In order to address the question of mechanism , we sought to determine which region of the rPRL promoter was important for mediating this c-Jun inhibition .
In the rPRL promoter , footprints ( FPs ) I , III , and IV bind GHF-1/Pit-1 , a pituitary-specific POU-homeodomain transactivator ( 36 , 53 ) .
FP II binds a ubiquitous repressor denoted as F2F , and the -117 to -80 BTE binds a ubiquitous basal transcription-acti-vating factor , both of which have yet to be characterized ( 43 ) .
Using a series of 5 deletions and site-specific mutations of the rPRL promoter impinging on these various regulatory cis-acting sites ( shown in Fig .
3A ) , we show that c-Jun equally inhibited rPRL promoter constructs with 5 end points of -425 , -255 , and -189 ( Fig .
3B ) .
However , the effect of c-Jun switched to an activating response with rPRL promoter 5 ' end points of -125 , -54 , and -36 ( Fig .
3B ) .
Of note , statistical analysis ( Student 's £ test ) revealed that the effects of c-Jun are statistically significant to p < 0.05 for the -425 and -125 end points and significant to p < 0.01 for the -255 and -189 end points , whereas the effects of c-Jun on the -54 , -36 , and promoterless constructs were not statistically significant .
These data indicate that DNA sequences between -189 and -125 were responsible for the inhibitory effect of c-Jun , while sequences between -125 and -54 were responsible for c-Jun 's activating effect .
Moreover , neither the negative nor positive effects of c-Jun were due to a cryptic AP-1 site in the pA ; lue background vector , since c-Jun had no effect on the pA ; glue promoterless vector ( Figs .
2 and 3B ) .
Within the -189 to -125 region of the rPRL promoter lie both FP III and FP II .
In order to determine which of these two footprints was important for c-Jun action , we used a panel of site-specific mutants that featured a Sail linker sequence substituted for specific bases within the various footprints and a 6-Domain-dependent Switching of c-Jun Activity site-specific deletion of the BTE in a FP II mutant background ( Fig .
3A ) .
As shown in Fig .
3C , mutations in FPs I and III , the A1 and A1,3 mutants did not prevent the c-Jun-mediated inhibition of the rPRL promoter , excluding these sites as DNA targets of the c-Jun inhibitory effect .
Indeed , these two mutant promoters were inhibited to a greater extent by c-Jun , perhaps because of the disruption of GHF-1 activating sites .
However , mutation of FP II , in either the A2 or A2 , D constructs , led to a loss of inhibition , thereby mapping the c-Jun effect to FP II of the rPRL promoter ( Fig .
3C ) .
These data are consistent with the 5 deletion data , showing that disruption of FP II in the -125 and shorter constructs eliminated the repressing effect of c-Jun ( Fig .
3B ) .
Removal of the 8-Domain Switches c-Jun from an Inhibitor to an Activator-In order to investigate potential structure-function correlations as they related to mechanism , we sought to determine which domains of the c-Jun protein were required to mediate the inhibition of the rPRL promoter .
As shown schematically in Fig .
4A , the c-Jun protein consists of five major domains .
The 8-domain is important for protein-protein inter-actions , including the interaction with Jun kinase ( 18 , 54 ) .
Next , there are two functionally determined transactivation domains ( 9 ) .
Finally , there is a basic domain for DNA binding and a COOH-terminal leucine zipper domain , which is important for protein dimerization ( 1 , 2 ) .
Given the data indicating that the 8-domain plays an important regulatory role , modulating c-Jun 's transactivation potential in a cell-specific manner ( 9 , 20-23 ) , we chose to use a v-Jun construct , which differs from c-Jun in that it lacks the NH-terminal 8-domain and contains three COOH-terminal point mutations ( 9 , 19 ) .
Surprisingly , pRSVv-jun had the opposite effect of c-Jun on the intact -425 rPRL promoter in GH , cells , producing a 12.9-fold promoter stimulation , whereas c-Jun resulted in a 42 % inhibition ( Fig .
4B ) .
These data demonstrate that loss of the 8-domain provides a functional switch , turning v-Jun into an activator .
To address whether equal amounts of transfected plasmids produced equivalent amounts of expressed Jun pro-tein , we performed Western blot analysis using a Jun antibody capable of recognizing both c-Jun and v-Jun .
As shown in Fig .
4C , c-Jun was actually produced in slightly greater amounts than v-Jun , and the levels of endogenous GHF-1 in these transfected cells were unaffected by c-Jun and mildly stimulated by v-Jun .
These data show that differences in c-Jun or v-Jun protein production are not responsible for the specific effects of each Jun construct .
The Absence of Pituitary-specific Factor ( s ) Switches c-Jun from an Inhibitor to an Activator of the rPRL Promoter-Since the 8-domain of c-Jun has been implicated in cell-specific modulation of both transcription and transformation ( 9 , 20-23 ) and we documented that deletion of the 3-domain modulates the inhibitory function of c-Jun in GH , pituitary cells ( Fig .
4B ) , we next sought to determine the functional role of c-Jun and v-Jun on the rPRL promoter in nonpituitary Hela human cervical carcinoma cells .
To address these points , we used a nonpituitary gene transfer reconstitution system , whereby the ability of co-transfected effector expression vectors ( eg .
GHF-1 ) to reconstitute the activity of the rPRL promoter in Hela cells , which otherwise fail to express endogenous PRL or GHF-1 , can be determined ( 45 ) .
As shown in Fig .
5A , transfected GHF-1 alone stimulated rPRL promoter activity by 21.3-fold , verifying that the reconstitution approach is functional .
Surprisingly , co-transfection with c-Jun alone did not inhibit the rPRL promoter , as described previously in GH , cells , but instead c-Jun activated the rPRL promoter 2.6-fold , indicating that the c-Jun inhibition of the rPRL promoter noted in GH , cells is pituitary cell-specific .
Moreover , when c-Jun and GHF-1 expression vec- 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 6-Domain-dependent Switching of c-Jun Activity A -255 +189 -125 0-54-36 -425 M a v 425 +73 AA __ = < +73 +73 +73 AL,3 e 171483 B _ 5 Relative Promoter Activity 425 -255 -189 -125 -54 + pRSV c-jun -36 pA3luc Relative Promoter Activity ~425 Al AZ A2 , D _ Al,3 + pRSV c-jun Fic .

B , c-Jun repression of the rPRL promoter maps between -189 and -125 base pairs .
The indicated rPRL promoter deletions ( 5 pg ) were transiently transfected into GH , cells with either 20 ug of pRSV -globin or pRSVe-jun .
-Fold activation was determined relative to the basal activity of each individual promoter construct .
Data are expressed as mean fold for four transfections done in triplicate .
Statistical analysis ( student ¢ test ) reveal that the effects of c-Jun are significant to p < 0.05 for the -425 and -125 end points and to p < 0.01 for the -255 and -189 end points .
Additionally , the effects of c-Jun on the -54 , -36 , and promoterless constructs were not statistically significant .
C , c-Jun repression of the rPRL promoter maps to the FP II region .
The indicated rPRL site-specific mutants ( 5 ug ) were transiently transfected into GH , cells with either 20 ug of pRSVB-globin or pRSVe-jun .
-Fold activation was determined relative to the basal activity of each individual promoter construct .
Data are expressed as mean -fold + S.E .
for three transfections done in triplicate .
tors were co-transfected into Hela cells , a synergistic activation of the rPRL promoter of 131-fold was observed ( Fig .
5A ) .
By contrast , v-Jun alone stimulated the rPRL promoter only slightly ( 1.5-fold ) , compared with its effects in GH , cells ( 12.8-fold ; Fig .
4B ) .
Nevertheless , v-Jun also synergized with GHF-1 to stimulate the rPRL promoter 43.5-fold .
Western blot analy-sis , internally controlled for actin protein levels , demonstrated that the transfected c-Jun and v-Jun expression vectors resulted in comparable protein levels in Hela cells ( Fig .
5B ) .
These data demonstrate that in a nonpituitary cell background , the effect of c-Jun on the rPRL promoter is switched to that of an activator , whereas v-Jun functions as an activator in both pituitary and nonpituitary cells , underscoring that the functional effect of the 8-domain is cell type-specific .
Furthermore , these data show that c-Jun is unlikely to inhibit rPRL promoter activity in GH , cells by interfering with GHF-L. Having shown that c-Jun alone activated rPRL promoter activity and synergized with GHF-1 to further enhance rPRL promoter activity in the HeLa nonpituitary cell system , we next sought to map the cis-acting element mediating the c-Jun activation of the rPRL promoter in Hela cells .
As shown in Fig .
6 , the activating effect of c-Jun on the intact -425 rPRL promoter ( 3.5-fold ) was lost upon site-specific mutation of FP I , either alone ( 1.2-fold ) or in combination with a FP III mutation ( 1.2-fold ) ; whereas mutation of FP II had no effect on the ability of c-Jun to activate rPRL promoter ( 3.8-fold ) in HeLa cells .
These results are in agreement with the data from GH , cells shown in Fig .
3B , indicating that the activating effects of c-Jun co-localize to DNA sequences containing the most proximal GHF-1 binding site .
Since c-Jun synergized with GHF-1 in HeLa cells ( Fig .
5A ) , we wanted to ascertain whether these two proteins could physically interact .
c-Jun Binds to GHF-1 in Vitro-To directly determine whether c-Jun and GHF-1 physically interact , we performed in vitro binding assays whereby the ability of either recombinant protein A alone or a protein A-GHF-1 fusion protein prebound to IgG beads to pull down radiolabeled c-Fos , c-Jun , or GHF-1 proteins was assessed ( Fig .
7 ) .
Twenty percent of the radiolabeled protein input of rat c-Fos , human c-Jun , and rat GHF-1 is shown in lanes 1 , 4 , and 7 , respectively .
Rat c-Fos showed no interaction with either the protein A alone or protein A-GHF-1 beads ( anes 2-3 ) .
By contrast , c-Jun showed a low level of interaction with the protein A beads ( lane 5 ) , whereas there was significant binding of c-Jun to protein A-GHEF-1 ( Zane 6 ) .
Since GHF-1 is known to homodimerize ( 36 ) , we showed that radiolabeled GHF-1 interacted with the protein A-GHF-1 beads , as a positive control for the binding assay ( Zane 9 ) but that labeled GHF-1 binds to protein A beads only minimally 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 17144 A 1__31 57 340 e-jun wm [ | s | ___ Tap [ Tap|pep| 11111 |C J B¥ jun kinase GSK3 vwjun on - [ | TAD [ rap| pso [ 111 | c Relative Promoter Activity basal + c-jun 4 v-jun 0.58 12.86 w < 4- 46 kDa Gnd 4- c-Jun botton i 4- v-Jun e r mot duns | < - cio ; I- 30 kDa Fic .

The inability of labeled c-Fos to bind to protein A-GHF-1 beads indicates that there is specificity to the GHF-1-c-Jun interaction .
DISCUSSION Although our understanding of c-Jun function has progressed quite rapidly , some of the original observations relating to the differential and cell-specific effects of c-Jun versus v-Jun in transcription and transformation assays have remained unexplained .
In this paper , we show that c-Jun inhibition of rPRL promoter basal activity requires the c-Jun 8-domain , the FP II site , and the pituitary-specific cell type .
Alteration of any one of these features switches the inhibitory effect of Jun to that of an activator .

promoter strongly suggest that c-Jun and v-Jun mediate their differential effects upon the same promoter in the same cell type due to a mechanism independent of DNA binding speci-ficities .
Taken together , our data are most consistent with the model that the structural difference between these two Jun isoforms , specifically the 5-domain , dictates a second level of transcription control by governing factor-factor interactions .
The information gained provides critical mechanistic insights into the molecular code by which Jun proteins regulate gene expression .
The absence of the 8-domain in v-Jun renders this protein unable to bind or to be phosphorylated by Jun kinases ( JNKs ) , yet v-Jun is typically a much more potent oncogene , raising the interesting possibility that phosphorylation is required primarily to `` inactivate `` the 8-domain in c-Jun ( 25 , 55 ) .
From these data , it is tempting to speculate that catalytically inactive JNK , which binds tightly to the & -domain , functions as the putative repressor , possibly by masking the amino-terminal 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 6-Domain-dependent Switching of c-Jun Activity Relative Promoter Activity -425 AL A2 AL,3 + pRSVc-jun Fig .

transactivation domain and/or influencing c-Jun 's ubiquitination and degradation , and that JNK activation causes its release from c-Jun ( 18 , 24-26 ) .
Nevertheless , several lines of evidence argue against this hypothesis : 1 ) recent studies have shown that only a small fraction ( 5-10 % ) of c-Jun in quiescent cells is bound with JNK ( 25 ) ; 2 ) the region of the 8-domain required for JNK binding ( amino-terminal ) is distinct from that required for repression ( carboxyl-terminal ) ( 18 , 23 , 25 ) ; 3 ) the JNK pathway is primarily an apoptotic one and not a transforming one ( 56 ) ; and 4 ) the difference in c-Jun versus v-Jun protein levels is small ( 23 ) .
Thus , 8-domain-dependent mecha-nisms , other than JNK binding or ubiquitination control , must exist and are yet to be elucidated ( 57 ) .
Using a cellular promoter in a homologous and highly specialized neuroendocrine cell line rather than a viral or artificial heterologous promoter in a fibroblast cell , we show that the 8-domain maintains cell-specific effects .
Of note , the effect of the c-Jun 8-domain in our system was to inhibit rPRL promoter activity rather than to mediate a partial activation or simply produce no effect , as reported previously ( 9 , 21 ) .
If c-Jun were to bind a putative pituitary-specific repressor via the 8-domain and thus recruit this repressor to an AP-1 site by c-Jun binding to DNA , then c-Jun should function as an intrinsic inhibitor on all AP-1-containing promoters in the GH , cell type .
However , our current and published data show that c-Jun activates the AP-1-containing Fos ( Fig .
2 ) and collagenase promoters ( 40 ) in these GH , cells .
Additionally , the rPRL promoter does not contain a canonical AP-1 site ( 41 ) .
With regard to mechanism , if c-Jun were to titrate a putative cell-specific co-activator , then this co-activator would have to display specificity for the rPRL 17145 co-repressor co-activator FPIV _ FP IMI FP II BTE FPI -125 Fic .

Model for c-Jun repression of rPRL promoter activity in GH , cells .
c-Jun stabilizes the binding of a pituitary cell-specific repressor protein to FP II by a protein-protein interaction mechanism that requires the 8-domain of c-Jun .
Thus , deletion of the 8-domain , elimination of the pituitary-specific inhibitor , or site-specific mutation of FP II would nullify this inhibitory effect .
In HeLa nonpituitary cells devoid of the pituitary-specific repressor , c-Jun functionally interacts with GHEF-1 to cooperatively activate the rPRL promoter via FP I. c-Jun is represented by the white ovals , the pituitary cell-specific repressor is represented by the black squares , and GHF-1 is represented by the gray rectangle .
and rGH genes , since c-Jun inhibits both promoters ( Fig .
2 ) and v-Jun activates both promoters ( Fig .
4 and data not shown ) .
In this respect , we initially surmised that c-Jun might be interfering with the function of Pit-1/GHF-1 by binding to this factor , thereby inhibiting both rPRL and rGH promoter activ-ities .
Surprisingly , our data show that c-Jun does interact with Pit-1/GHEF-1 directly ( Fig .
7 ) but that such an interaction results in activation of the rPRL promoter in a Hela cell reconstitution assay ( Fig .
5 ) via the most proximal Pit-1/GHF-1 binding site ( Fig .
6 ) .
By contrast , mapping of the cis-acting element mediating c-Jun 's inhibitory response co-localized the Jun responsive element to the FP II site , previously identified as a binding site for the putative repressor , F2F ( 43 ) .
Since F2F ( 43 ) and the c-Jun inhibitor both require an intact FP II site , the formal possibility remains that these two proteins might belong to the same family of transcription factors .
Nevertheless , it is highly unlikely that they will be the same factor .
Indeed , there are several lines of evidence that show that the F2F repressor functions and is expressed in a variety of nonpituitary cell lines , including Hela and Rat 2 cells ( 43 ) , whereas the putative target of c-Jun functions in a GH , pitui-tary- and FP II-specific manner ( Fig .
3 and 5 ) .
It is the apparent absence of the c-Jun inhibitor in Hela nonpituitary cells that allows c-Jun to switch function and become an activator of the rPRL promoter .
These data imply that the interaction between the c-Jun 8-domain and the pituitary-specific inhibitor is dominant , and abrogation of this interaction is required in GH , pituitary cells in order to unmask the recessive and activating effects of c-Jun , which are mediated by FP I and GHF-1 .
Based on the results presented here , we have formulated a model , presented in Fig .
8 , which incorporates all of these features .
In this model , we propose that c-Jun stabilizes the binding of a pituitary cell-specific repressor protein to FP II , by a protein-protein interaction mechanism that would require the 8-domain of c-Jun .
Thus , deletion of the 8-domain , elimination of the pituitary-specific inhibitor , or site-specific mutation of FP II , would nullify this dominant inhibitory effect and 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 17146 unmask the recessive activating effect of the GHF-1°c-Jun complex acting via FP I .
Consistent with this model is the observation that both c-Jun and v-Jun functionally interact with GHF-1 to cooperatively activate the rPRL promoter via FP I ( Figs .
5A and 6 ) in HeLa nonpituitary cells devoid of the pituitary-specific repressor .
These results indicate that a region distinct from the 8-domain of c-Jun interacts with GHF-1 , since both c-Jun and v-Jun synergize with GHF-1 ( Fig .
5A ) .
Nevertheless , the 8-domain does appear to contribute to the GHF-interaction , since c-Jun cooperates more efficiently with GHF-1 than does v-Jun ( Fig .
5A ) .
However , if c-Jun is able to interact with GHF-1 to stimulate rPRL promoter activity , why is this interaction recessive to the c-Jun-pituitary-specific F2F interaction in GH , cells ?
We have previously shown that the FP II sequence functions as an inhibitory element only when juxtaposed to the vicinal BTE ( 43 ) .
Moreover , site-specific mutation of the BTE renders the rPRL promoter devoid of basal activity , despite intact GHF-1 binding sites ( 43 , 44 ) .
Thus , if c-Jun enhances the inhibitory effect of the FP II site and if this effect is transduced to the BTE , as shown previously , then the functional interaction between c-Jun and the pituitary-specific FP II-binding factor should dominate over the c-JunmGHF-1 response .
Finally , implicit in this model is that DNA binding of either c-Jun or v-Jun to the rPRL promoter is not necessary , but instead c-Jun and v-Jun would mediate their effects through protein-protein interactions with other factors whose presence is dictated by the developmental state of the cell .
This notion would be consistent with the lack of a canonical AP-1 site in the rPRL promoter .
Although the 8-domain definitely affects c-Jun activity , the cumulated data indicate that its function is much more complicated than a simple interaction of the 8-domain with a putative cell-specific repressor , as initially postulated ( 9 , 23 , 48 ) .
In this respect , the ability of c-Jun to induce differentiation in F9 teratocarcinoma cells ( 11 ) and to inhibit the basal activity of highly specialized promoters ( 30-32 ) , suggest that the putative effects of the 8-domain may be governed by multiple regulatory influences , including the differentiated state of the cell , environmental cues , signaling events , repressors , co-activators , and ubiquitination machinery .
Indeed , as if to verify this point , several reports have shown that the c-Jun amino-terminal transactivation domain , including the 8-domain , functionally ( and in some cases physically ) interacts with 1 ) certain transcription factors , such as MyoD , myogenin , steroid receptors , and STAT3B , to either repress or activate transcription of specific target genes , and 2 ) JNK ( 18 , 24 , 29-32 , 57 ) .
These data suggest that the 8-domain may contain several functional faces , one interacting with JNK and a separate face that might interact with other proteins , some of which may be cell-specific .
