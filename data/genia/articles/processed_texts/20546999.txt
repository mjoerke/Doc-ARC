Among them , thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) are known to exert dominant roles in their survival and functional shaping .
Key molecules mediating TEC , thymocytes interactions include cytokines and growth factors secreted by the two cell types and adhesion receptors mediating cell contact .
Signaling events triggered in thymocytes by adhesion to epithelial cells have been extensively investigated , whereas little is known on the opposite phenomenon .
We have previously investigated this issue in a co-culture system composed of TEC cultures derived from human normal thymus and heterologous thymocytes .
We demonstrated that thymocytes adhere to TEC involving B1 and B4 integrins and induce the clustering of « 3B1 and « 6B4 heterodimers at the TEC surface .
In addition thymocyte adhesion was followed by activation of NF-KB and NF-IL6 gene transciption factors and enhanced IL-6 production .
The two latter phenomena were reproduced by the cross-linking of the 03 , 6 , B1 and B4 integrins , thus implying that the « 3B1 and ( 6B4 heterodimers can signal during thymocyte adhesion .
We have extended our previous work investigating in the same experimental setting the inducing activity of non stimulated or activated policlonal or clonal mature T cells as representative of the more mature thymocyte subset .
We found that adhesion of unstimulated T cell i ) involved B1 , but not B4 integrin functions at the surface ii ) induced the clustering of « 3B1 , but not ( 2B1 heterodimers at the TEC surface and iii ) up-regulated the nuclear binding activity of NF-KB transcription factor and the IL-6 secretion .
We propose that « 3B1 and heterodimers are induced to cluster at the TEC surface recognizing yet unknown cellular ligands differentially expressed during T cell development .

( TEC ) ( Boyd et al , 1993 ) .
More recently , it has became evident that a two-way interaction occurr between TEC and thymocytes , in such a way that thymocytes themselves act as a cellular constraints required for proper development of thymic epithe-lium .
TEC differentiation and T-cell commitment appear to be interdependent during the thymic orga-nogenesis .
Studies in SCID , human CD3g-transgenic or RAG ( -/- ) knockout mice have shown in fact that the blockage of thymocyte differentiation at the DN CD44* CD25~ stage determines the lack of organization of the cortical epithelium whereas that at the CD44~CD25* stage results in the absence of medullary epithelium ( Hollander et al , 1995 , Penit et al , 1996 , Klug et al , 1998 ) .
Thymic epithelium is composed of different subsets , interconnected by desmo-somes and surrounded by extracellular matrix , forming an intralobular network filled with developing thymocytes ( Boyd et al , 1993 ) .
The molecular interactions between thymocytes and the subcapsular , cortical or medullary TEC are far from being elucidated because the pathways of human TEC differentiation are still uncertain and the TEC progenitors remain unidentifyed .
However , key elements that might be involved in all these interactions are the cytokines , growth factors and neuropeptides differentially secreted by the two cell lineages ( Savino et al , 1998 , Hadden J.W .
, 1998 ) and the multiple adhesion receptors ( i.e .
member of the Ig superfamily , integrins and cadherins ) interacting at the single cell level ( Patel D.D .
and Haynes B.F. , 1993 , Lee et al , 1994 , Salomon et al , 1997 ) .
TEC produce multiple cytokines and growth factors and express a wide number of cytokine , or adhesion receptors .
Several cytokines and growth factors ( i.e .
IL-1 $ , IL-6 , EGF , NGF ) have been investigated as regard their activity in promoting TEC expansion , differentiation or expression of endogenous cytokine genes ( Screpanti et al , 1992 and 1995 , Cohen-Kamin-sly et al , 1993 ) .
Less is known regarding the activity of adhesion receptors .
Previous reports by us and others indicated that TEC derived from normal or myasthenic thymus increase the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins or the production of IL-6 following the coculture with thymocytes or neoplastic T cells ( Couture et al , 1992 , Cohen-Kaminsky et al 1993 , Ramarli et al , 1996 ) .
Based on these observations we put forward the hypothesis that adhesion receptors at the TEC membrane initiate these phenomena .
Among them , we focussed on integrins as trigger-elements at the membrane level , and on IL-6 as a target gene , in consideration of : i ) the known ability of integrins to induce cytokine gene expression in other adherent cells ( Defilippi et al , 1997 ) , and ii ) the importance of IL-6 within the thymic microenvironment , due to its activities on activation , survival and cytotoxic differentiation of lymphoid and epithelial cells ( Henttinen et al 1995 , Adkins et al 1996 , Akira , S and Kishimoto T , 1997 ) .
The IL-6 gene expression is regulated at a tran-scriptional level by the cooperative activity of NF-KB and NF-IL6 transcription factors ( Akira , S and Kishimoto T , 1997 ) .
Both transcription factors undergo kinase-dependent , post-transcriptional modification to function .
Tyrosine or serine phosphorylation of inhibitors of NF-KB ( IxBs ) is needed to disrupt the cytosolic IxB-NF-kB complexes thereby allowing p50 /p65 active NF-KB heterodimers to enter the nucleus ( Baldwin AS , 1996 ) .
Extensive serine/threo-nine phosphorylation is required to regulate the transactivation potential and the DNA binding activity of the four NF-IL6 isoforms so far decribed in epithelial and fibrosarcoma cell lines ( Akira , S and Kishimoto T , 1997 ) .
Adhesion-dependent induction of IL-6 gene expression was investigated in normal TEC at tras-criptional and protein levels , analysing the time-dependent activation of IL-6 gene transcription factors and the protein secretion .
We found that heterologous thymocytes : i ) adhere to TEC involving Bl and , to a lesser extent , B4 integrins at the membrane level ; ii ) induce the clustering of « 3B1 and « 6B4 heterodimers at the TEC surface .
We also found that adhesion of thymocytes , but not their soluble factors , induced the activation of IL-6 gene transcription factors and the IL-6 gene expression ( Ramarli et al , 1998 ) .
The cross-linkings of a ( 3,6 ) or B ( B1 , B4 ) integrins mediated by mAbs reproduced the two latter phenomenon .
These observations implyed that TEC/thymocytes mutual interactions may regulate the availability of IL-6 within the microenvironment via INTEGRINS , IL-6 AND THYMIC EPITHELIUM 197 TEC induction triggered by B1 and B4 clustering at the cell surface .
The thymocyte ligand/s recognized by TEC integrins remain unidentifyed .
However , to investigate whether the/se ligand/s were expressed in a stage- , activation- or microenvironment-dependent manner we extended our previous studies , analysing in the same experimental framework the inducing activity of circulating mature T cells , freshly isolated or driven to proliferation by mitogen treatment or antigen recognition .
T cells were chosen , although they represent a mature thymocyte subset only , in order to avoid the use of harsh fractionation procedures which might alter the membrane reactivity and/or the apoptotic rate of thymocyte subpopula-tions .
We found that TEC grown in organized , integrin-polarized monolayers bind in a time dependent manner and with increasing rate to unfractionated thymocytes , non stimulated T cells , policlonally stimulated T cells or Ag-stimulated clonal T cells .
The TEC binding to the various T cells i ) involved fl integrin function at the surface , whereas the b4 contribution was irrelevant ii ) induced the clustering of 3B1 , but not « 2B1 heterodimers at the TEC surface and iii ) was associated with increased nuclear binding activity of NF-KB transcription factor , known to be required for maximal expression of IL-6 gene expression in inducible systems ( Akira , S and Kishimoto T , 1997 ) .
Based on previous and present results we propose that i ) « 3B1 integrins expressed at the TEC surface recognize cellular ligand/s that are present on thymocyte populations most likely including the phe-notypically mature subset and maintained by circulating normal T cells whereas ii ) ©6B4 integrins recognize on thymocytes ligand/s restricted to stage-or microenvironment-dependent expression .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell isolation and cultures Thymic epithelial cell cultures were derived from patients ( age < 5 yr ) undergoing corrective cardiosurgery as previously described ( Green et al , 1979 ) .
Briefly , tissue specimens were minced and trypsinised ( 0.05 % trypsin/0.01 % EDTA ) at 37°C for 3 h. Cells were collected every 30 min , pooled , plated onto lethally irradiated 3T 3-J2 cells ( gift of Prof. H. Green , Harvard - Medical - School , Boston , MA ) - at 2.5x10*/cm and cultured in humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO ; in growth medium composed of DMEM/Ham 's F12 media ( 3:1 mixture ) , 10 % FCS , insulin ( 5 pug/m !
1 ) , transferrin ( 5 ug/m1 ) , adenine ( 0.18 uM ) , hydrocortisone ( 0.4 cholera toxin ( 0.1 nM ) , triiodothyronine ( 2 nM ) , Epidermal Growth Factor ( 10 ng/m ! )
, glutamine ( 4 mM ) , and antibiotics .
From the 3° passage cells were plated in the absence of feeder-layer cells and grown in one thirds of insu-lin , transferrin , adenine , hydrocortison , cholera toxin , triiodothyronine and EGF .
These cells were used for experimental assays .
Media were purchased from Ser-omed ( Berlin , FRG ) and supplements from SIGMA-Aldrich ( Milano , Italy ) .
EGF was from Aus-tral Biological ( San Ramon , CA ) .
Human thymocytes were prepared by mechanical disruption of fresh thymus specimens .
At least 95 % viable cells were isolated from the cell suspension by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient , washed and used immediately after prepara-tion .
T cells were isolated from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( Pbl ) by E-rosetting and one-step Ficoll-Hypaque gradient .
Purified T cells were used whithin 24 h from isolation ( also referred as T cells in the text ) or after stimulation with PHA ( ug/ml , Murex , Pomezia , Italy ) and rIL-2 ( 200 U/ml ) ( generously provided by Chiron , Milano , Italy ) for 7-10 days .
MBP ( Myelin basic protein ) specific T cell clones were isolated by plating in limiting dilution ( 0.3 cell/96 wells Costar plate ) Pbl ( obtained from a patient with Multiple Sclerosis ) previously stimulated for a week with 100 ugs/ml of MBP ( Sigma ) in RPMI-1640 at 10 % human AB serum and a second week with rIL-2 ( 100 IU/ml ) .
Wells positive for cell growth were further expanded , analysed for specific Ag recognition and used as cloned T cells .
Clonality was assessed by statistical methods .
T cells , PHA-IL-2 activated and Ag-activated T cells were analysed by cytofluorometry for the expression of MHC-class II , CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , ICAM-1 , B2 chain of LFA-1 complex and B1 integrins .

Flow cytometry was performed in a FacScan flow cytometer ( Bec-ton-Dickinson ) .
Binding Assays Epithelial cells were plated into 24-wells plates ( Cos-tar , Cambridge , MA ) at high density ( 5x10° cells/well ) 24 h before assays .
T cells were labelled overnight with [ 14C ] —leucin ( NENTM , Life Products , Boston MA ) ( 310.86 mCi/mMole , 10mCurie/10®cells ) in RPMI containing 10 % FCS and 10 mM Hepes .
Labeled cells were washed and resuspended at 10° cells/ml in RPMI , 10 mM Hepes and 3 % BSA .
Labelled cells were dispensed on each well at the indicated TEC/T cell ratio and allowed to adhere for the indicated times at 37°C .
Nonadherent cells were removed by gentle pipetting ( sample A ) followed by three washes with binding medium ( sample B ) .
Adherent cells were solubilized by addition of 100ml of 1 % SDS ( sample C ) .
Non adherent cells ( A ) , washes ( B ) or adherent cells ( C ) were mixed with Filter Count CSC cocktail ( Packard Instrument , Meri-den , CT ) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter Wallac 1409 ( Wallac , Turku , Finland ) .
The percentage of lymphoid cell binding was calculated as cpm of sample C/epm of sample ( A + B + C ) .
Immunostaining of TEC/T cell cocultures Cocultures carried on overnight at 37°C humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 1:1 TEC : T cell ratio , were fixed in 3 % paraformaldheyde ( electron microscope grade ) , 2 % sucrose in PBS pH 7.6 for 5 min at room temperature and permeabilized ( 3 min , 4°C ) in Hepes-Triton X-100 buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , 300 mM sucrose , 50 mM NaCl , 3 mM MgCI2 , 0.5 % Triton X-100 , pH 7.4 ) .
Staining for F-actin was performed with fluorescein-labeled phalloidin ( F-PHD ; Sigma ) ( 200 nM for 20 min at 37°C in the dark ) .
Adhesion molecules were detected with the relevant mAbs ( see above ) followed by rhodamine-tagged swine anti rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse IgG .
Primary antibodies were replaced by mouse IgG or preimmune rabbit sera in control samples .
Coverslips were incubated with the appropriate rhodamine-tagged secondary antibodies routinely supplemented with 200 nM F-PHD .
After-washing , coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 ( Hoechst , Frankfurt am Main , Germany ) and observed in a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped for epifluorescence and a 63x planapochromatic lens .
Stained coverslips were photographed with Kodak T-MAX 400 films exposed at 1000 ISO and developed at 1600 ISO in T-MAX developer for 10 min at 20°C .
The same coverslips were analyzed in parallel with a confocal laser scanning microscope ( CLSM Bio-Rad 1024 ) .
Image files were recorded on different channels , digitally reconstructed to provide z-axis views and printed with ADOBE Photoshop 3.5 .
INTEGRINS , IL-6 AND THYMIC EPITHELIUM 199 Cell extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSA ) TEC monolayers were cocultured with the various T cells for the indicated times .
After removing T cells by extensive vigorous washings , cell extracts were prepared as previously described ( Schreiber et al , 1989 ) from TEC detached by trysin-EDTA treatment and scored negative for CD2+* contaminants by cytofluor-ometry .
Protein concentration was assessed by Coomas-sie protein assay reagent ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) .
DNA binding activity was determined by using a end-labelled double stranded oligoprobe containing the xb site of the IL-6 promoter .
Six pugs of cell extracts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the probe ( 1x10° cpms/sample ) in 20 ull of binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 , 0.1 M NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mg/ml BSA , 0.1 % NP-40 , 4 % glycerol ) containing 1 ug of Poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweeden ) .
Nucleoprotein complexes were electro-phoresed on a 5 % polyacrylamide ( 30:1.2 ) gel in 0.05 M Trisborate/1 mM EDTA at 150 V. Gels were dried and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm films ( Amer-sham , Little Chalfont , England ) .
Film densitometry was performed with an UltrpoScan Densitometer and the built-in software ( LKB , Bromma , Sweden ) .
Cell labelling , Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting TEC monolayers were labelled overnight with 25 uC/ml of '*C-leucine ( 324.9 mC/mMole ) ( NEN Research Dupont , Boston , MA ) in medium .
Cell lysates were prepared as for EMSA .
Twenty ugs of nuclear extracts were pre-cleared with 20 pul of swollen Protein A-Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia ) in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2 , 0.5 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM PMSF adjusted to 0.15 M NaCI ) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the anti NF-IL6 antiserum at 1 : 10° dilution for additional 2 h on ice .
Immunocomplexes were precipitated with 20 ul of Protein A-Sepharose beads for 1h at room temperature and extensively washed in 0.05 M Tris-HCl pH 7.2 , 0.15 M NaCl , 0.1 % NP4O0 .
Immunoprecipi-tates ( at equal amount of counts ) were fractionated by 12 % -SDS-PAGE , electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane ( BioRad , Milano , Italy ) and probed with anti phosphoserine mAbs peroxidase-labelled goat anti mouse-Igs in TBST 1.5 % w/v powdered low fat dry milk .
Membranes were washed with TBST buffer and specific bands revealed by Enhanced Chemilumines-cence system ( ECL , Amersham ) .
IL-6 production Cocultures destined to IL-6 production assays were carried on 12 h. After T cell removal , TEC were recovered by trypsin-EDTA , analyzed for the absence of contaminants as above and plated onto new plates .
Cell supernatants were collected 24 and 72 h from re-plating and assayed for IL-6 production by ELISA kit according to manufacturer 's instructions ( CLB , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) .
OD values were plotted on the standard curve and expressed as ng/IO6 cells recovered .
RESULTS Circulating mature T cells were compared to immature thymocytes for the ability 1 ) to reproduce the inducing activity on IL-6 gene expression in TEC and 2 ) for the recruitment of « 3B1 and 6B4 integrin heterodimers at the TEC membrane .
We firstly assessed whether differences in the T cell activation influenced the lympho-epithelial adhesion .
To this purpose , binding assays were performed between TEC grown to tightly confluent monolayers and i ) unfractionated freshly isolated thymocytes , ii ) non stimulated purified T cells , iii ) PHA-IL2-acti-vated T cells or Ag-specific activated clonal T cells .
Adhesion partners were preliminary analysed by cytofluorometry for the expression of lineage-specific or activation antigens and adhesion molecules ( not shown ) .
Freshly isolated , unfractionated thymocytes comprised 21+7 ( SD ) % of CD3 negative , 53+4 % of Cp3low-intermediate ang 2548,5 % CD38 `` positive cells , all expressing the B2 chain of LFA-1 complex and low level of 1 integrins .
Purified T cells ( > 94 % 200 EMMA FIORINI et al .
CD34 uniformly expressed high amounts of B2 chain of LFA-1 but very low levels of ICAM-1 and Bl integrins .
Activated T cells and Ag-specific T cell clones ( the latter 100 % CD4 positive ) shared the coexpression of high amounts of MHC-class II antigens with B2 integrins ( > 80 % and > 95 % respectively ) as well as the expression of B1 integrins ( 53+33 SD and 60+39 SD , respectively ) .
The extent of ICAM-1 expression was higher on mitogen than in Ag activated clonal T cells ( 71+28 SD % vs 46+32 SD % ) .
TEC uniformly expressed high amounts of MHC-class I , Bl and « 3 integrins with moderate amounts of « 5 .
Seventy-80 % of the cells expressed 6 and ( B4 integrins whereas 9.5-20 % were found to be positive for ICAM-1 .
Virtually all cells lacked CD18 , CD16 , VCAM and MHC-class II antigens .
TEC/THYMOCYTE AND TEC/T CELL ADHESION As shown in Table I , lympho-epithelial adhesion occurred quickly with all T cells examined , progressively increasing from the lowest levels observed at 30 min with thymocytes or T cells ( 18+1.5SE % and 33+2.5SE % respectively ) to the intermediate levels of mitogen-activated policlonal T cells ( 39+2.5SE % ) up to the highest levels found in Ag-activated clonal T cells ( 46+5.3SE % ) .
All lympho-epithelial adhe-sions increased after 1h , yet maintaining a difference between the level of thymocytes ( 38+2.4 ) and the similar plateau reached by non stimulated and activated T cells ( range : 45+3.1-50+0.8 % ) .
As we have previously demonstrated that B1 and B4 integrins belong to the group of molecules mediating TEC adhesion to thymocytes , ( Ramarli et al , 1998 ) we next investigated whether the same molecules were involved in the TEC adhesion to mature T cells .
TEC/T CELL ADHESION INVOLVES INTEGRIN OF THE B1 FAMILY The function of B1 and B4 heterodimers in TEC-T cell binding could not be directly investigated ( i.e .
by blocking experiments with inhibiting peptides ) , because they both recognize conformational structures ( Branderberger et al 1996 , Delwel G.0 . )
and it was hence evaluated by mAbs recognizing their extracellular domains .
Non specific mouse Igs and anti ICAM-1 mAbs were respectively used as additional negative and positive controls .
TEC monolayers were used precoated with the different mAbs for 30 min at 4° C. Values of non specific mouse Igs were subtracted from those of mAb-treated samples .
As shown in Table II , TEC/T cell bindings were all inhibited by anti B1 mAbs , but to a very different extents .
Great inhibitions were observed with thymocytes or non stimulated T cells ( 43+18E % and 36+7SE % respectively ) whereas low inhibitions were observed with mitogen ( 12+3.4 SE % ) or Ag-activated T cells ( 9+0.185E % ) .
Anti B4 mAbs inhibited TEC/thymocytes binding ( 26+1.5 % ) , but failed in the case of T cells or Ag-specific clones or showed very low activity in the case of activated T cells ( 9+2 % ) .
MAbs anti ICAM-1 consistently inhibited TEC interaction with thymocytes , activated or Ag-activated T cells , whereas lacked activity in the case of non stimulated T cells .
These results indicated that integrins of the B1 family were still recruited in the TEC/T relationship with T cells , whereas heterodimers seemed to be more restricted in that with thymocytes .
Based on the results obtained in binding and binding inhibition studies we selected the unstimulated T cells for further investigations .
First , it was assessed whether their adhesion may trigger B1 repolarizations at the cell contact sites .

T CELL ADHESION INDUCES « 3861 , BUT NOT « 261 INTEGRIN CLUSTERING AT THE CELL BOUNDARIES TEC /Tcells cocultures were immunostained with mAbs recognizing & ( 2 , ( 3 , 04 ) and Bl integrins and examined by optical microscopy ( Figs 2 ) .
Previous immunohystochemical studies of TEC monolayers have shown that « 3B1 and ( 2B1 lined the TEC intercellular boundaries codistributing with the microfilamentous network ( Ramarli et al , 1998 ) .
Adjoining thymocytes selectively remodeled this pat-tern , in a way that « 3B , but not clustered at the TEC/thymocyte contact sites , still maintaining its lateral distribution ( ibid ) .
The same phenomenon was observed in the case of T cells .
As shown in panels b only T cells expressed o4BI1 .
« 3B1 , but not « 2B1 ( not shown ) lined both the intercellular TEC boundaries and the interface between TEC and T cells ( panels d and £ ) , codistributing with the microfilamentous network ( see F-actin staining in panels e and f ) .
This finding prompted the search for laminin 1 and 5 , fibronectin and Collagen IV in between TEC and T cells .
All proteins were found located at TEC attachment surface while neither was found interposed at the TEC-T cell interface ( not shown ) , thus indicating that « 3B1 , among the considered surface antigens , was selectectively induced to cluster at the TEC-T cell contact sites by an unknown mechanism that apparently excluded any known bridging component of the extracellular matrix .
Based on these findings the T cell adhesion was compared with that of thymocytes as the inducing activity on IL-6 gene expression .

Serine phosphorylation of NF-IL6 isoforms was assessed in similar extracts by Western blot analysis of NF-IL6-immune-precipitates probed with anti phosphoserine mAbs and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence .
Shown in the figure are the the fold increase over controls determined by film densitometry .
As shown in the upper panel , the adhesion of thymocytes , but not their soluble factors , almost triplicated the NF-KB nuclear binding activity found in the untreated TEC .
Similar activity was exerted by the mAb-mediated cross-linking of « ( 3 , ( 6 ) or B ( B1 , B4 ) integrins , whereas non cross-linked mAbs failed to function .
NF- « xB nuclear complexes contained transcriptionally active p50/p65 NF- « B heterodimers ( Baldwin AS , 1996 ) , as assessed by the band supershifting obtained in the presence of antisera specifically recognizing p50 or p65 subunits ( not shown ) .
Adhesion of thymocytes or integrin cross-linking ( middle panel ) greatly increased also the extent of serine-phosphorylation of the NF-IL6 43 and 36 Kda isoforms ( the latter not shown ) endowed with transactivating activity ( Akira S and Kishimoto T , 1997 ) .
In contrast to what observed for NF-KB activity , non-crosslinked mAbs anti B4 mAbs were partially effective .
The analysis of IL-6 produced by control and stimulated TEC ( lower panel ) demonstrated that activation of both NF-KB and NF-IL6 transcription was associated with augmented IL-6 secretion , thus indicating that the two phenomena were causally related .
It has been demon strated by transfection studies in murine carcinoma cell lines that overexpression of NF-IL6 and the p65 subunit of NF-KB synergistically activates an IL-6 promoter-reporter construct , indicating that these two factors are sufficient to sustain the activation of IL-6 gene ( Matsusaka et al , 1993 ) .
It has been also demonstrated that p65 subunits is required for maximal gene expression ( ibid ) .
We could not assess the relative transactivation of NF-KB and NF-IL6 transcription factors , because TEC stimulated by thymocyte adhesion or cross-linking of ( 3 , ( 6 and B1 integrins activate the two transcription factors at the same time .
Experiments performed with anti B4 mAbs allowed a least to evaluate the NF-IL6 transactivation with or without the cooperation of NF-KB .
Results shown in the IL-6 panel indicate that the transactivation induced by NF-IL6 alone was doubled by the presence of NF-KB transcription , thus confirming in normal cells regulated by endogenous transcription factors what previously observed in tumor cells trans-fected with plasmid constructs .
Based on this obser-vation , the T cell inducing activity on TEC IL-6 gene transcription factors was restricted to the time course analysis of NF-KB nuclear binding activity .
T CELL ADHESION INDUCES NF- « B NUCLEAR BINDING ACTIVITY AND IL-6 PRODUCTION IN TEC NF-KB binding activity was evaluated in TEC cocultured for 3 h and 12 h with T cells at 1:2 TEC/T cell ratio or treated for 12 h with T cell supernatants .
After the removal of T cells ( see the Materials and Methods section ) TEC were detached , scored negative for CD2*contaminants and used as source of nuclear extracts .
TEC aliquots from the 12 h-cocultures were also replated and examined 24 h later .
IL-6 secretion was measured in TEC cocultured for 12 h and treated as above .
Supernatant from re-plated TEC were collected 24 h and 72 h from the removal of the stimulus .
T cell supernatant were prepared from T cell cultured 12 h in TEC medium and used at concentration comparable to the number of cocultured cells .
As shown in table III the constitutive NF-KB binding activity of TEC was quickly up-regulated by the T cell contact ( 2.1+0.4 at 3 h ) , sustained during the contact ( 2.3+0.2 ) and maintained at least up to 24 hrs after the removal of the cell stimulus ( 1.9+0.3 ) .
According to this , the IL-6 production by stimulated TEC was increased 24 h after the removal of the simulus ( 1.79+ 0.7 ) and still up-regulated 48 h later , as demonstrated by the accumulation observed at the 72 h time point ( 2.7+1.7 ) .
T cell supernatants exerted a negligeable activity ranging 0.01-0.03 fold increase at the two time points .

DISCUSSION Various procedures are currently in use to derive TEC cultures in vitro .
Differences concern both the initial steps of the cell isolation from thymic tissues ( i.e .
enzymatic digestion or explant tecnique ) and the expansion in culture ( i.e .
feeder-layer cell support , serum addition , qualitative composition of complements in the growth medium ) .
All these difference may ultimately result in the preferential expansion of discrete TEC subsets or in culture-induced modifications of expanded cells , hence possibly accounting for the conflicting results often reported in the litterature on TEC expression of surface molecules ( i.e .
MHC-II antigens , ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 ) or functional properties ( susceptibility to viral infections ) .
By using the procedure described in the Materials and Methods section we reproducibly obtained the development of TEC monolayers that display an homogeneous morphology , produce extracellular matrix components ( laminins and fibronectin ) and maintain unaltered both surface phenotype and morphology up to the passage of culture , thereafter assuming the spindle-shaped morphology proposed as a marker of late differentiation .
The finding that these TEC lack VCAM-1 , recently proposed as a marker of cortical cells `` in vivo `` ( Salomon et al , 1998 ) whereas they uniformly expressed an 3 integrin detected `` in vivo `` in the medullary regions ( Giunta et al , 1991 ) is suggestive for a medullary rather than a cortical ori-gin .
According to reports by others ( Boyd et al , 1993 ) TEC maintained in culture the constitutive production of IL-6 and IL-8 toghether with consistent amounts of Rantes ( Ramarli D , personal unpublished observa-tion ) .
It has been reported that cytokines and growth factors induce the IL-6 production by TEC through mechanisms most likely affecting the mRNA stability ( Schluns et al 1997 ) .
The first point raised by our work is that IL-6 production can be also up-regulated in TEC at a tran-scriptional level , by signals delivered by the cross-linking of B1 and B4 integrins at the surface .
Integrins are large family of /f transmenbrane heterodimers able to recognize both extracellular matrix-or cellular ligands and consequently to activate in mesenchimal or lymphoid cells intracellular signalling pathways leading to the expression of genes coding for cytokines or chemokines ( IL-1B , IL-6 , IL-8 , IFNy ) ( Defilippi et al , 1997 , Mainiero et al , 1998 ) .
Signal transduction by integrins has been a matter of intense investigations in the last few years .
Reports to date evidenced that clustering of B1 or B4 integrins at the cell surface determines elevation of intracellular pH and transients , activation of tyrosinkinases and protein kinase C isoforms , regulation of the Ras and Rho families of the small GTP-proteins and activation of mitogen-activated-protein ( MAP ) and extra-cellular-signal-regulated ( ERK ) kinases ( Defilippi et al , 1997 , Giancotti FG .
, 1997 ) .
Less is known on the integrin-mediated activation of gene transcription factors , particularly in normal cells .
We have investigated Bl and B4 integrins function in a normal epithelial cell system following ligation and clustering performed with mAbs , treatments which can mimick the integrin engagement with natural ligands .
206 EMMA FIORINI et al .
We demonstrated that the cross-linking of o ( 03 , 6 ) or B ( B1 , B4 ) chains triggers intracellular cascades able to activate both NF-KB and NF-IL6 transcription factors which , in turn , fulfill the requirements for a maximal transactivation of the IL-6 gene resulting in augmented protein production .
Several consideration can be made regarding these results .
The first concern the activity of IL-6 produced by TEC , which may of particular relevance within the thymic microenviro-ment in the light of fact that TEC and thymocytes share the expression of IL-6 receptors .
Because of that , integrin regulated or upregulated production of IL-6 may exert dual functions within thymus : on one hand on the survival and/or the cytotoxic differentiation of thymocytes and on the other hand on the differentiation of epithelial cells .
The second concern the role which could be played in TEC by the activated NF-KB and NF-IL6 transcription factors beside the transactivaton of the IL-6 gene .
Both transcription factors appear implicated in the control of the survival and/or differentiation of normal and neoplastic epithelial tissues .
NF-KB plays a crucial role in the protection from apoptosis in several epithelial and mesenchimal cells ( Beg A and Baltimore D , 1996 ) and , more specifically , in the rescue of rat endothelial cells observed after cross-linking of avfB3 integrins ( Scatena et al 1998 ) .
NF-IL6 appears to regulate the proliferation of normal murine hepato-cytes ( Diehl et al 1998 ) and the differentiation of normal human keratinocytes and mammary secretory epithelial cells ( OH and Smart 1998 , Robinson et al 1998 ) .
Based on these reports , the finding that B1 and B4 cross-linking activated the two transcription factors suggest that , likewise other epithelial cells types , the TEC adhesion to ECM components may regulate their fate and differention .
Within this frame , we have observed in normal TEC that the NF-kB activation induced by the cross-linking of ( 3B1 integrins partially inhibits TEC from apoptosis following growth factors deprivation ( Scupoli et al , 2000 ) .
The third consideration concern the molecular mechanisms underlying the constitutive activation of IL-6 gene transcription factors and the basal production of IL-6 detectable in non stimulated cells .
TEC grow in culture forming continous monolayers whose organization is maintained throught the activity of the adhesion receptors that interact at the cell-cell and cell-pastic interface .
As demonstrated by immunohys-tochemistry a3B1 and a6B4 integrins selectively polarize at one or the other location , most likely engaged by ECM proteins and yet unknown cellular ligands .
Whether the integrin pools are composed of recycling or stably recruited molecules still need to be elucidated , however , it is conceivable that asyn-cronous signals delivered by integrins during their ligand recognition may contribute to maintain a basal level of IL-6 production .
The second point raised by our work is that the constitutive production of IL-6 by TEC was strongly up-regulated by the contact with thymocytes or mature T cells which , at the same time , induced the clustering at the TEC contact sites of « 3B1 and integrins .
The lack of detection of ECM proteins at the TEC/thymocyte or TEC/T cell interfaces toghether with the different ability of mAs anti B1 and anti B4 to inhibit the various T cell populations , strongly support the hypothesis that « 3B1 and 6B4 integrins espressed by TEC recognize their ligands on the membrane of thymocyte or T cells .
The identity of these ligands is at the present unknown .
However , binding inhibition studies performed by mAbs indicate that they are differently distributed and/or regulated during the T cell differentiation and activation .
Putative ligand/s recognized by « 6B4 at the thymocyte surface seem to be restricted to early stages of T cells differentiation - or to a - microenvironment-dependent expression because they disappeared on mayority of mature T cells .
By contrasts , those recognized by heterodimers seem shared by thymocytes and mature T cells , thus suggesting a microenvironment-independent , - later - expression within thymus .
Noteworthy , T cell activation negatively influenced this expression .
It has been previously shown in keratinocytes that « 3B1 integrins can interact homotypically ( Symington et al , 1993 ) .
This is unlikely to occurr at the TEC/T cell interface , because the anti B1 mAbs inhibited the binding of unstimulated T cells , that expressed faint amounts of B1 integrins , but failed in the case of activated T cells which express large amounts of the molecule .
What INTEGRINS , IL-6 AND THYMIC EPITHELIUM 207 ever the nature of the cellular ligands , they efficiently recruit integrins able to activate in TEC the signalling pathways leading to activation of NF-KB and NF-IL6 and IL-6 gene expression thereby implying that this recognition is one of the mechanisms underlying the inducing activity of immature or mature T cells .
It has been demonstrated that ECM adhesion and de-adhe-sion regulate the cell positioning within tissues , their survival or differentiation .
We propose here that het-erotypic cell-cell adhesion thank to the activity of the same adhesion receptors may cooperate in or finely tune the same processes .
