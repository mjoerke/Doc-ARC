J. van Rood , Leiden University Hospital , Leiden , The Netherlands , April 8 , 1996 ( received for review October 2 , 1995 ) ABSTRACT Vaccination with synthetic peptides representing cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) epitopes can lead to a protective CTL-mediated immunity against tumors or viruses .
We now report that vaccination with a CTL epitope derived from the human adenovirus type 5 E1l1A-region ( AdSE1A ; 34-243 ) , which can serve as a target for tumor-eradicating CTL , enhances rather than inhibits the growth of Ad5E1A-expressing tumors .
This adverse effect of peptide vaccination was rapidly evoked , required low doses of peptide ( 10 ug ) , and was achieved by a mode of peptide delivery that induces protective T-cell-mediated immunity in other models .
AdS5E1A-specific CTL activity could no longer be isolated from mice after injection of Ad5E1A-peptide , indicating that tolerization of AdSE1A-specific CTL activity causes the enhanced tumor outgrowth .
In contrast to peptide vaccination , immunization with adenovirus , expressing Ad5E1A , induced AdSE1A-specific immunity and prevented the outgrowth of AdSE1A-expressing tumors .
These results show that immunization with synthetic peptides can lead to the elimination of anti-tumor CTL responses .
These findings are important for the design of safe peptide-based vaccines against tumors , allogeneic organ transplants , and T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases .
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) can play an important role in the defense against experimental and human malignancies ( 1 , 2 ) .
CTL recognize small antigenic peptide fragments in the context of class I major histocompatibility molecules ( 3 ) .
These peptides are mostly generated from endogenously synthesized proteins .
Vaccination with synthetic peptides corresponding to CTL epitopes can induce protective CTL-mediated immunity in a variety of model systems ( 4 ) .
For instance , immunization of mice with synthetic peptides deduced from proteins of either Sendai virus or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ) led to the induction of protective immunity against a subsequent challenge of respectively Sendai virus or LCMV ( 5 , 6 ) .
In tumor models , protective immunity was established by immunization with tumor-specific synthetic peptides .
Immunization with a peptide derived from the human papillomavi-rus type 16 ( HPV16 ) led to the protection against a lethal dose of HPV16-transformed tumor cells ( 7 , 8 ) , and vaccination with a peptide encompassing a CTL epitope derived from chicken ovalbumin led to the induction of protective immunity against a thymoma transfected with the cDNA of chicken ovalbumin ( 9 ) .
The approach of using synthetic peptide CTL epitopes for the induction of CTL responses is now being applied in human beings .
Peptides encoded by the HPV16 early region 6 and 7 ( E6 and 7 ) oncogenes that are immunogenic to human CTL have been identified ( 10 ) and are currently employed at our hospital in a phase I/II peptide vaccination study .

on virus-infected cells ( 11 ) .
While these results provide the basis for the development of peptide-based prophylactic and therapeutic anti-tumor vaccines , vaccination with synthetic peptides may also lead to T cell unresponsiveness ( 12 , 13 ) .
At least three repetitive intra-peritoneal ( i.p . )
immunizations with a relatively high dose ( 100 ug/mouse ) of synthetic peptide deduced from the glycoprotein of LCMV induced specific T-cell tolerance , and this mode of peptide delivery prevented the induction of diabetes by infection with LCMV in a transgenic mouse model in which LCMV glycoprotein was expressed in the B islet cells of the pancreas ( 12 ) .
Apparently , there is a balance between induction of T-cell responses and tolerization by injection of antigenic peptides .
These differences in outcome of peptide vaccination could have a strong impact on the design , delivery , and development of peptide-based anti-tumor vaccines , but will also have implications for vaccination strategies against T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases and other harmful T-cell-mediated immune destructions .
In this paper we show that a single vaccination with a low dose of a subcutaneously ( s.c. ) given peptide comprising a CTL-epitope derived from the human adenovirus type 5 early region 1A ( Ad5E1A ) oncogene promotes rather than suppresses the outgrowth of AdSE1A-expressing tumor cells in normal immunocompetent mice .
The inhibitory effects of peptide vaccination were also noted on adoptively transferred AdSE1A-specific CTL clones and in T-cell receptor ( TCR ) transgenic mice .
The implications of these findings for the development of peptide-based intervention protocols against T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases , allogeneic organ transplants , viral infections , and malignancies are discussed .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice .
C57BL/6 ( B6 Kh , H-2 `` ) mice were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Institute ( Amsterdam ) and C57BL/6 nu/nu ( B6 nude ) were obtained from Bomholtgard ( Ry , Denmark ) .
The TCR transgenic mice express the TCR-a and -B chains derived from the H-2D®-restricted , AdSE1Aq34-243-specific CTL clone 5 ( 14 ) .
This T cell uses rearranged Val6 and VB1 TCR chains .
The cDNAs encoding the complete a and B chains were inserted into an expression construct based on genomic sequences of the human CD2 gene ( 15 ) , and the resulting transgenes were coninjected into blastocysts of C57BL/6 ( B6 Kh ) mice .
Cell Lines and Culture Conditions .
Cells expressing AdSE1A and EJras ( AR-cell lines ) were generated by trans-fection with pAdSE1A ( Psfl ) ( 16 ) , pEJras ( 17 ) , and pTK-neo Abbreviations : AdSE1 , adenovirus type 5 early region 1 ; CFA , complete Freund 's adjuvant ; CTL , cytotoxic T lymphocyte ; HPV , human papillomavirus ; IFA , incomplete Freund 's adjuvant ; IL-2 , interleukin 2 ; IL-2 , recombinant IL-2 ; LCMV , lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ; TCR , T-cell receptor .

( 14 ) .
Expression of AdSE1A and EJras gene products was confirmed both at the mRNA and protein level ( data not shown ) .
All other cell lines used were generated as described ( 14 , 18 ) .
All cells were maintained as described elsewhere ( 7 , 14 , 18 ) .
Peptides .
Peptides were generated by solid phase strategies on a ABIMED 422 synthesizer ( ABIMED , Langenfeld , Ger-many ) as described ( 19 ) .
Peptides were stored dry at -70°C .
The purity of the peptides was determined by analytical phase HPLC using water-acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1 % tri-fluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) and proved to be at least 85 % ( UV , 214 nm ) .
The integrity of the peptides was determined by laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( TOF-MALDI ) on a lasermat mass spectrometer ( Finnigan-MAT , Herts , UK ) .
About 5 pmol of the peptide in 0.5 ul water/acetonitrile containing 0.1 % TFA was mixed with 0.5 ul of matrix solution [ ACH ; 10 mg/ml in acetonitrile/water , 60/40 ( vol/vol ) containing 0.1 % TFA ) and applied to the instrument .
Calibration was performed with peptides of known molecular mass .
Peptide Immunization and Challenge with AdSEIA + ras Transformed Tumor Cells .
Peptide immunizations were performed as previously described ( 5-7 ) .
Peptides dissolved in 100 l phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) were extensively mixed with 100 ul incomplete Freund 's adjuvant ( IFA ) and 0.5 % ( wt/vol ) of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) .
The 200 pl mixture was s.c. injected in B6 mice .
Two weeks later mice were challenged with 10 `` AdSE1A + ras transformed tumor cells ( clone AR 6 ) or 0.5 x 10° HPV16-transformed tumor cells ( clone HPVC3 ) s.c. in 300 pul PBS .
Limiting Dilution .
CTL clone 5 ( 1.5 X 10 `` ) ( 14 ) was administered intravenously in normal immunocompetent mice .
Three days later 100 ug of the AdS5E1A-encoded CTL epitope AdSE1A ; 34-243 ( sequence , Ser-Gly-Pro-Ser-Asn-Thr-Pro-Pro-Glu-lle ) or the AdSE1Bis2-zmo-encoded ( control ) CTL epitope ( sequence , Val-Asn-Ile-Arg-Asn-lle-Cys-Cys-Tyr-lle ) ( 18 ) in PBS was mixed with IFA plus 0.5 % ( wt/vol ) BSA and s.c. injected .
Six days later spleen cells of these animals were plated out in a limiting dilution assay .
Twenty-four replicate microcultures were set up per serial dilution of responder spleen cells and 5 X 10° irradiated ( 25 Gy ) inter-feron-y ( 2 days , 10 units/ml ) AdSEl-transformed cells in U-bottomed tissue culture plates .
After 7 days of culture in the presence of 10 Cetus Units of recombinant interleukin 2 ( rIL-2 ) the microcultures were split into three and tested in an Europium- ( Eu®* ) release assay ( 7 ) on 10° Eu'*-labeled syngeneic target cells in a total volume of 100 pl in the presence of 0.5 uM of peptide Ad5E1A734_243 ( 14 ) , peptide AdS5E1B192-200 ( 18 ) , or the HPV16 E749 $ _-s7-encoded peptide Arg-Ala-His-Tyr-Asn-Ile-Val-Thr-Phe ( 7 ) .
Microcultures were scored as responding and nonresponding cultures .
Responding cultures were defined as those in which the Eu'+* release value exceeded the mean background Eu®* release plus three times the standard deviation .
Limiting dilution analysis predicts that if 37 % of the tested microcultures is negative , then for that given responder cell concentration there is an average of one CTL-precursor per well ( 20 ) .
CTL-precursor frequencies were only taken into account if the goodness of fit was = < 12.5 ( jacknife method ; ref .
21 ) .
In Vivo Administration of Tumor-Specific CTL Clones .
In vivo therapy for AdSEl-induced tumors with tumor-specific CTL clones was performed as described ( 14 ) .
In short , B6 nu/nu mice with AdS5E1-induced tumors ranging from 40-50 mm ?
were treated with intravenous injections of B6 Ad5SE1A-specific CTL clone 5 ( 1.5 % 10 `` ) in combination with 10° Cetus Units rIL-2 , administered s.c. mixed with 100 pg of peptide AdS5E1A ; 34-243 or 100 ug of peptide Ad5E1B192-200 as a control in IFA containing 0.5 % BSA at a site distant from the tumor .
The mixtures of peptide/IL-2 and IFA were prepared as described above .

USA 93 ( 1996 ) RESULTS Generation of AdS5E1A + ras Transformed Tumor Cells .
Previously , we described a CTL epitope encoded by the AdSE1A region ( AdSE1A » 34- » y43 ) .
This CTL epitope is presented to the immune system in the context of H-2D® , and CTL clones directed against this epitope are able to eradicate large established AdSE1-induced tumors in B6 nude mice ( 14 , 22 ) .
This indicates that the AdSE1A-encoded epitope is able to elicit CTL capable of mediating tumor regression of Ad5E1A-expressing tumors in vivo .
To test whether vaccination with this CTL epitope is also able to induce protective immunity against AdSE1A-expressing tumor cells in immunocompetent mice , we generated tumor cells transformed by the AdSE1A region and an activated ras oncogene .
The AdSEIA + ras transformed cells are recognized by Ad5E1A-specific CTL clone 5 , showing that these tumor cells present the AdS5E1Ap34- » s-encoded CTL epitope ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , AdSE1A + ras transformed tumor cells , in contrast to AdSE1-transformed cells , are tumorigenic in immunocompetent mice , so that they can be used to study the effects of vaccination with peptide AdSE1Ap34.- » 43 on the induction of protective CTL mediated immunity against tumor outgrowth in vivo .
A dose of 10 `` tumor cells injected s.c. causes growth of small tumors in 80-100 % of the mice .
By day 40 , ~10-30 % of the animals die because of a progressively growing tumor .
The other animals , which have developed a tumor , still carry it or have eradicated the tumor ( 5-10 % of the animals ) ( data not shown ) , indicating that AdSE1A + ras transformed tumor cells are weakly immunogenic in immunocompetent mice .
Immunization with the AdS5E1A-Encoded CTL Epitope Leads to an Enhanced Outgrowth of AdSE1A + ras Expressing Tumor Cells , Immunocompetent B6 mice were immunized once s.c. with peptide AdSE1Ap34- » 43 in IFA , a vaccination protocol that has been successfully used to induce protective immunity in several other models ( 5-7 ) .
Two weeks later the mice were challenged with AdS5E1A + ras transformed tumor cells .
Control mice immunized with irradiated tumor cells were protected against the outgrowth of Ad5E1A + ras transformed tumor cells , indicating that protective immunity can be established against these tumor cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
Unexpectedly , mice immunized with the AdSE1A peptide were not protected against the outgrowth of these tumor cells .
Instead , the tumors in these animals grew faster than the tumors in animals that were injected with IFA only , or with the H-2D®-binding control peptide HPV16 E749-5 ; in IFA ( Fig .
14 ) .
All animals vaccinated with the AdSE1A peptide died within 40 days after tumor challenge , whereas at that time almost all animals in the control groups were still alive ( Fig .
1 ) .
These results indicate that immunization with peptide AdSE1Ap34-243 leads to the inability of immunized mice to control the outgrowth of AdSE1A-expressing tumors .
This effect is induced very rap-idly , since injection of 10 ug of the AdSE1A peptide at the left flank and a tumor cell challenge on the right flank of the animal on the same day resulted in the enhancement of tumor outgrowth ( Fig .
1C ) .
To define the minimum amount of peptide required to observe the enhancement of tumor outgrowth , we titrated the injected dose of peptide ( Fig .
2 ) .
Mice injected with 10 ug of the AdS5E1A peptide develop rapidly growing tumors earlier and died sooner than animals injected with lower doses of peptide or an H-2D®-binding control peptide ( P = 0.004 ; log-rank test ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
Protective immunity against the outgrowth of AdSE1A + ras cells could not be induced at any concentration of peptide ( ranging from 10 pg to 1 ng peptide per mouse ) , since the tumor-take in mice receiving the AdS5E1IA peptide was the same as the tumor-take in mice receiving the AdS5E1B control peptide ( data not shown ) .

Vaccination with the AdSE1A peptide results rapidly in the inability to control the outgrowth of AdSE1A + ras transformed tumor cells .
Mice were immunized s.c. with irradiated Ad5E1A + ras cells in PBS ( 0 ) , left untreated ( - ) , immunized with 50 ug of peptide Ad5E1A234.-243 in IFA ( @ ) , with 50 ug control peptide HPV16 E749-57 in IFA ( 0 ) , or with IFA only ( a ) .
Two weeks later the mice were challenged with live Ad5E1A + ras cells on the other flank .
Tumors in mice immunized with Ad5E1A peptide grow more rapidly compared with tumors in animals treated with control peptide ( P < 0.0001 ; one-sided Student 's f test ) .
Mean tumor volumes + SEM ( # = 10 ) are shown in mm* ( 4 ) .
Mice immunized with AdSE1A peptide die sooner because of a progressively growing AdSE1A + ras tumor compared with mice injected with control peptide ( P = 0.0006 ; log-rank test ) ( B ) .
The enhanced outgrowth of AdSE1A + ras transformed tumor cells is induced rapidly after peptide vaccination ( C ) .
Mice were immunized s.c. on day zero with 10 ug of the AdSE1A peptide in IFA or with 10 ug of the HPV16 E7-encoded control peptide in IFA and on the same day , on the other flank , injected with live AdSE1A + ras transformed tumor cells .
Mice receiving AdSE1A peptide develop bigger tumors than mice injected with control peptide .
Mean tumor volumes + SEM ( # = 5 ) are shown in mm* .
Ad5E1A-expressing tumors .
This shows that these tumors do not grow more rapidly when control peptides are injected , but only when the AdSE1A peptide is given .
Thus , this effect is peptide-specific .
To show that immunization with the Ad5E1A peptide leads to the enhanced outgrowth of AdSEI1A-expressing tumors , and not of other tumor types , we immunized B6 mice with the HPV16 E749-s7-derived CTL epitope mixed with the Ad5E1A ; 34-243 peptide .
Mice were challenged with HPV16-transformed tumor cells .
Immunization with peptide HPV16 E74 $ -s7 ; induces protective CTL-mediated immunity against HPV16-induced tumors ( 7 ) .
Mice immunized with the mixture of Ad5E1A and HPV16 E7 peptides in IFA are equally well protected against a subsequent challenge of HPV16-transformed tumor cells as mice immunized with HPV16 E7 peptide in IFA only ( Fig .
3 ) .
Moreover , tumor growth rates of HPV16-transformed tumor cells in mice immunized with only AdSElAp34- » 43 was the same as the tumor growth rate in control mice ( data not shown ) .
These data indicate that injection of peptide Ad5E1A ; 734_ » 43 does not result in a general inability of the mice to reject tumors .
Taken together , these observations suggest that immunization with the AdSE1A-encoded CTL epitope leads to a specific functional deletion of AdSE1A-specific immunity , resulting in an inability to reject AdSE1A-expressing tumors .

- Tumor growth of AdSE1A + ras cells after titration of the Ad5E1A234-243 peptide .
Mice were immunized s.c. with irradiated AdS5E1A + ras cells , with 10 ug of the Ad5E1B ; 192-2m-encoded control peptide ( 18 ) in IFA , or with 50 to 0.001 ug of the AdSE1A peptide in IFA .

To study the effect of administration of the Ad5SE1A peptide on AdSE1A-specific CTL activity , AdSE1A-specific CTL clone 5 was adoptively transferred into naive immung-competent animals .
Three days later peptide or an AdS5E1B ; s2-200-encoded control peptide ( 17 ) were ad-ministered .
The presence of CTL clone 5 in the spleen of these animals was functionally tested 6 days later .
CTL clone 5 could only be recovered from animals that received CTL clone 5 and the AdSE1B control peptide , but not from animals that received CTL clone 5 and the AdSE1A peptide ( Table 1 ) .
Administration of the Ad5E1A peptide had no effect on the presence of adoptively transferred AdSE1B-specific CTL clones ( data not shown ) .
To study whether the AdSEI1A peptide had also an effect on naive AdS5E1A-specific CTL , B6 mice expressing a transgenic TCR specific for the AdSE1A peptide were injected with the Ad5E1A peptide .
In contrast to splenocytes from normal B6 mice , splenocytes from naive TCR-transgenic mice , when restimulated in vitro with Ad5E1A peptide-loaded lipopolysaccharide blasts , display strong cyto-lytic activity against Ad5E1-transformed cells .
After injection of the AdS5E1A peptide , but not of an irrelevant control peptide , the spleen cell cultures derived from Ad5SE1 A-specific TCR-transgenic animals are no longer able to lyse Ad5E1-transformed tumor cells ( Fig .

At day 9 the spleen cells were taken and put in limiting dilution .
At day 16 the contents of the wells were tested on syngeneic RMA cells loaded with 0.5 uM of the HPV16 E749-s7-encoded control peptide , the Ad5E1B192-20p-encoded control peptide , or the Ad5E1A ; 34- » 4s-encoded peptide .

bined data on tumor outgrowth and AdSE1A-specific CTL activity after peptide immunization indicate that both naive and preactivated AdSE1A-specific CTL are functionally deleted by administration of the AdSE1Ap34- » 4s-encoded CTL epitope .
The AdS5E1A Peptide Rapidly Diffuses Through the Body After s.c. Administration in IFA .
The data described above indicate that intravenously injected AdSE1A-specific CTL clone 5 is functionally deleted in vivo by s.c. administration of the AdSE1A-encoded CTL epitope .
CTL clone 5 is able to eradicate established AdS5E1-induced tumor in nude mice ( 14 ) .
To test if administration of the AdSE1A-peptide leads to the inability of CTL clone 5 to eradicate established AdSE1-induced tumors in vivo , we treated Ad5SE1 tumor-bearing nude mice by intravenous injection of CTL clone 5 .
At the same time the AdSE1A peptide , or as a control , the AdSE1B192-200-encoded peptide , was given s.c. together with rIL-2 in IFA .
Unexpectedly , the animals that received CTL clone 5 and the AdSE1A peptide died within 16 h ( Table 2 ) , whereas animals that received only the AdSE1A peptide or CTL clone 5 together with the AdSE1B peptide survived ( Table 2 ) .
Mice that received an AdSE1B-specific CTL clone in combination with the Ad5E1A peptide survived and eradicated the AdSE1-induced tumors ( data not shown ) .

Injection of the AdSE1A peptide deletes naive Ad5SEI1A-specific CTL activity .
Naive B6 mice , expressing a transgenic TCR specific for the AdSE1A peptide , were injected with 10 ug of the AdS5E1A734-243 peptide ( open symbols ) or 10 ug of the HPV16 E749-s7 peptide ( solid symbols ) s.c. in IFA .
Six days later 5 x 10° spleen cells of these animals were restimulated with 25 % AdSE1A peptide-loaded lipopolysaccharide blasts in a 24-well plate .
After 5 days of culture the bulk CTL cultures were tested on untransformed B6 MEC ( @ , O0 ) or AdSE1-transformed tumor cells ( @ , C ) .

100 0 AdS5E1-tumor-bearing nude mice ( 5 animals per group ) were treated with 1.5 X 10 `` AdSE1A-specific CTL clone 5 by intravenous ( iv . )
injection .
At the same day these mice received 10° Cetus units rIL-2 mixed with 100 ug peptide in IFA .
Sixteen hours later all animals receiving AdSE1A-specific CTL clone 5 and AdSE1A peptide were dead .
In all animals receiving CTL clone 5 and the AdSE1B-encoded control peptide , tumors were eradicated .
Values in table show percentage of dead mice .
CTL clone 5 and AdSE1A peptide had severely congested lungs ( data not shown ) .
Apparently , the adoptively transferred AdSE1A-specific CTL that are trapped in the capillary bed of the lungs become activated by injection of the AdSEI1A peptide , leading to the observed lung pathology .
The mechanisms involved in induction of this lung pathology falls beyond the scope of this study and are now under further investigation .
Nonetheless , these results show that s.c. administrated AdSE1A ; 34-243 peptide in IFA rapidly diffuses throughout the body where it is recognized by AdSE1A-specific CTL .
Protective Immunity Induced by Vaccination with Adeno-virus .
Immunization with the AdSE1A peptide leads to AdSE1A-specific CTL tolerance and severely affects the ability of B6 mice to cope with AdSE1A-expressing tumors .
Immunization with irradiated tumor cells , however , induces protective immunity against these tumor cells , showing the feasibility to induce protective immunity against Ad5E1A + ras transformed cells .
Vaccination with irradiated tumor cells will , however , be difficult to execute on a large scale in a clinical setting .
Recombinant adenoviruses might serve as efficient vaccine vehicles for the induction of protective anti-tumor immunity .
Recombinant adenoviruses are currently being tested for their ability to deliver genes to a spectrum of nondividing cells in vivo for the treatment of genetic diseases .
The use of recombinant adenoviruses is associated with transient gene expression due to a T-cell-mediated immune response against vector-derived proteins ( 23-25 ) .
This indicates that recombinant adenoviruses might also be used to induce protective immunity against tumors , when they contain DNA encoding for tumor antigens or tumor-derived T-cell epitopes .
To test if adenoviruses can indeed be used to establish protective immunity against tumors , we immunized B6 mice with an adenovirus type 5 variant ( ¢s149 ) .
AdSts149 is largely replication deficient , but expresses , upon infection , AdS5E1A-encoded protein ( 26 ) .
Mice immunized with Ad5ts149 showed high CTL reactivity against the AdSE1lA-encoded CTL epitope ( Fig .
5 4 and B ) and are protected against a subsequent challenge with AdSE1A + ras cells ( Fig .
5C ) .
These results show the possibility to use recombinant adenoviruses expressing tumor antigens for the induction of tumor-specific protective immunity .
DISCUSSION In the present report we show that a single s.c. immunizaton with 10 ug of the Ad5E1Ap34_ » 4s-encoded CTL epitope rather than inducing protective immunity against a challenge of AdSE1A-expressing tumor cells instead causes faster tumor outgrowth .
This effect is peptide-specific and is rapidly in-duced .
AdSE1A-specific CTL activity can no longer be detected after injection of the Ad5SE1A peptide from animals that express an AdSE1A-specific transgenic TCR or that have received Ad5SE1A-specific CTL clone 5 by adoptive transfer .
Although the latter observation might be a consequence of an altered migratory pattern of the Ad5E1A-specific CTL clone , Immunology : Toes et al .

Vaccination with a mutant adenovirus type 5 , expressing Ad5E1A , induces AdSE1A-specific CTL activity and protects against a subsequent challenge with AdS5E1A + ras cells .
B6 mice were immunized ( i.p . )
with PBS + 0.5 % BSA ( 4 and C ) or 2 X 10° plaque forming units of Ad5ts149 in PBS + 0.5 % BSA ( B and C ) .
Two weeks after immunization , the spleen cells of these mice were restimulated in vitro with 10 % AdSE1A + ras cells ( 4 and B ) , or the mice were challenged ( s.c. ) with AdSE1A + ras cells ( C ) .
The lytic activity of bulk CTL were tested after 5 days of culture against AdSE1A + ras cells , or syngeneic RMA cells loaded with 0.5 uM of the Ad5E1B192-20-encoded control peptide or the peptide Shown are the percentages of specific ly31s at different effector-to-target cell ratios ( 4 and B ) .
The mean tumor volumes + SEM ( n = 7 ) of mice challenged with tumor cells are shown in mm* in C. a more likely explanation is functional deletion of AdSE1A-specific CTL .
The Ad5E1A peptide rapidly diffuses throughout the body after s.c. injection in IFA and enhanced tumor outgrowth is also observed when the tumor challenge is given near the peptide-IFA depot in the same lymph nodes draining area ( data not shown ) , indicating that the AdSE1A-specific CTL are not massively attracted to the peptide-IFA depot .
Unlike mice immunized with adeno-derived peptides , mice immunized with live adenovirus or with irradiated tumor cells are protected against a subsequent challenge with AdSE1A-expressing tumor cells .
Great effort is currently directed toward the development of successful human gene therapies employing recombinant adenoviruses for gene transfer .
One obstacle in obtaining stable expression of the delivered gene in the target cells using this method is a vector directed , T-cell-mediated immune response ( 23-25 ) .
By introducing tumor antigens or ( several ) tumor-encoded T-cell epitopes in these adenovectors it is possible to induce protective T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity as demonstrated here for the AdSE1A epitope .
Peptide-based vaccination has been proven to induce T-cell-mediated protective immunity in several viral and tumor model systems ( 5-7 , 9 , 27 ) .
At the same time peptides have been found capable of T-cell tolerance induction ( 12 , 13 , 28-31 ) .
Repetitive and systemic ( 3 x i.p . )
injections of high doses of peptide derived from LCMV-induced tolerance of LCMV -specific CTL .
Local s.c. injections of this peptide protected mice against LCMV infection ( 13 ) .
Likewise , Kear-ney et al .
( 31 ) have shown in an adoptive transfer system that TCR-transgenic T cells are tolerized by systemic intravenous or i.p .
injections of the specific peptide .
In contrast , the same T cells are stimulated after s.c. injection of the peptide emulsified in complete Freund 's adjuvants .
They hypothesize that complete Freund 's adjuvant not only functions as a depot that mediates a relatively slow release of peptide for a prolonged time period , but would also activate the local antigen presenting cells because it contains Mycobacterial compo-nents .
We used as an adjuvant IFA .
IFA functions as a noninflammatory vehicle because it lacks bacterial compo-nents .
Nonetheless , s.c administration of the AdSE1A peptide in complete Freund 's adjuvant induces , in the AdS5E1A-tumor model , the same effects as injection of the peptide in IFA .
The rapid , peptide-specific effect on the ability of B6 mice to control the outgrowth of AdSE1A-expressing tumors is , like immunization in IFA , associated with severe lung congestion when given on the same day as an adoptively transferred AdSE1A-specific CTL clone ( data not shown ) .
Induction of T-cell tolerance has also been described in other TCR transgenic mouse models .
Continuous exposure to a high dose ( 100-150 ug ) of peptide 366-374 deduced from the nucleo- protein of influenza virus of TCR transgenic mice expressing a TCR with a specificity for this peptide resulted in a depletion of most peripheral CD8 # * T cells bearing the transgenic TCR ( 28 ) .
This depletion appeared to be the result of thymic clonal elimination as well as peripheral loss of reactive T cells .
Peripheral T cells in mice transgenic for TCR reactive with a simian virus 40-encoded peptide or a pigeon cytochrome c peptide are depleted in vivo by repeated injection of high doses ( 100 ug peptide injected i.p .
, three times ) of the specific peptides ( 29 , 30 ) .
In all these models , as opposed to the models where T-cell responses are induced , repetitive and systemic injections of relatively high doses of antigenic peptides are given .
We now describe that a single s.c. injection of a much lower amount of peptide in IFA can induce T-cell unrespon-siveness , leading to an enhanced outgrowth of tumors in normal immunocompetent animals .
The reasons why one peptide induces protective T-cell-mediated immunity and another T-cell tolerance when administered at comparable concentrations via the same vaccination scheme are intriguing .
A possible explanation is that peptides administered s.c. in IFA eliciting protective immune responses , such as the HPV16 peptide are retained locally , forming a gradient of antigen .
The AdSE1A peptide diffuses rapidly throughout the body , instigating downregula-tion of the Ad5E1A-specific CTL response .
Systemic distribution might lead to massive activation of peptide-specific CTL , that , especially if associated with inappropriate costimulation , may result in the clonal exhausting of these CTL .
By analogy , it has been reported in an LCMV model that virus spread and CTL induction/exhaustion are closely linked ( 32 ) .
Infection with LCMV-DOCILE , a virus isolate that replicates rapidly and widely when injected in- mice , induced LCMV -specific CTL tolerance , whereas infection with LCMV-WE , an isolate that replicates more slowly , induced long-lasting LCMV-specific CTL memory .
In this respect it is remarkable to note that administration of the HPV16 E745_5 ; peptide on the same day as intravenous injection of a HPV16 E74 $ _s7-specific CTL clone does not lead to severe lung congestion ( R.E.M.T .
, M.C.W .
Feltkamp , M.P.M .
Vierboom , C.J.M.M .
, and W.M.K .
, unpublished data ) , suggesting that the HPV16 E7-peptide is retained locally .
The observation that functional T-cell-specific tolerance can be induced by low doses of peptide administered locally is not only important for the development of safe peptide-based anti-tumor and anti-virus vaccines , but may also have implications for the design of therapeutic protocols for CTL-mediated autoimmune diseases and harmful T-cell responses against allogeneic organ transplants .
Modification of T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases and immunopathologies by peptides has been previously shown in a murine model of 7860 Immunology : Toes et al .
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and in a murine model of T-cell recognition of house dust mite allergens ( 33 , 34 ) .
Similarly , it has been shown that oral administration of major histocompatibility complex-derived allopeptides can induce donor-specific T-cell tolerance ( 35 , 36 ) .
By specifically tolerizing harmful CTL through injections with low doses of peptides it might be possible to prevent or temper CTL-dependent diseases .
In conclusion , in contrast to earlier reports describing induction of T-cell-mediated protection against a subsequent challenge of virus or tumor cells following a single s.c. injection of synthetic peptide in adjuvant , we now describe that such vaccination schemes can also lead to a functional deletion of tumor-specific CTL .
Epitope delivery by vaccination with infectious adenovirus type 5 was associated with protection and CTL memory rather than tolerance and tumor outgrowth .
Our results indicate that peptide-based vaccines must be employed with caution in a human setting , because immunization with tumor specific peptides might lead to a diminished rather than a protective immune response .
However , in the AdSE1A-tumor system only a single viral antigen is expressed .
In naturally occurring tumors there may be a larger number of relevant T-cell epitopes and tolerance to a single epitope may not have the same dramatic consequences as observed in the AdSE1A-tumor system .
Nonetheless , candidate peptides for human anti-virus and anti-cancer vaccines should be tested for their immunizing or tolerizing properties in vivo in vaccination experiments in human leucocyte antigen-transgenic mice ( 10 ) .
In addition , investigation of immunizing and tolerogenic modes of peptide delivery deserves detailed attention .
