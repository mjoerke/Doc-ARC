Using a radiolabeled chemical probe , we here purified a target of SR 31747A and called it SR 31747A-binding protein ( SR-BP ) .
Purified SR-BP retained its binding properties and migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a M , , 28,000 protein .
Cloning of the cDNA encoding human SR-BP shows an open reading frame for a 223-amino acid protein , which is homologous to the recently cloned sigma 1 receptor .
Interestingly , the deduced amino acid sequence was found to be related to fungal C8-C7 sterol isomerase , encoded by the ERG2 gene .
The ERG2 gene product has been identified recently as the molecular target of SR 31747A that mediates antiproliferative effects of the drug in yeast .
Northern blot analysis of SR-BP gene expression revealed a single transcript of 2 kilobases which was widely expressed among organs , with the highest abundance in liver and the lowest abundance in brain .
Subcellular localization analysis in various cells , using a specific monoclonal antibody raised against SR-BP , demonstrated that this protein was associated with the nuclear envelope .
When studying the binding of SR 31747A on membranes from yeast expressing SR-BP , we found a pharmacological profile of sigma 1 receptors ; binding was displaced by ( + ) -pentazocine , haloperidol , and ( + ) -SKF 10,047 , with ( + ) -SKF 10,047 being a more potent competitor than ( - ) -SKF 10,047 .
Scatchard plot analysis revealed K , values of 7.1 nm and 0.15 nm for ( + ) -pentazocine and SR 31747 , respectively , indicating an affinity of SR-BP 50-fold higher for SR 31747 than for pentazocine .
Additionally , we showed that pentazocine , a competitive inhibitor of SR 31747A binding , also prevents the immunosuppressive effect of SR 31747A .
Taken together , these findings strongly suggest that SR-BP represents the molecular target for SR 317474 in mammalian tissues , which could be critical for T cell proliferation .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org Sigma receptors , initially identified by Martin et al .
( 1 ) as a subclass of opiate receptors , were characterized by Su ( 2 , 3 ) in guinea pig brain .
They were subsequently found to be distributed in a variety of distinct regions of the central nervous system ( 4 ) , as well as in endocrine-related structures ( 5 ) , gastrointestinal tract ( 6 ) , liver ( 7 ) , and kidney ( 8 ) .
Sigma receptors were further identified in human peripheral blood mononu-clear cells ( 9-12 ) , and their presence was confirmed in rat spleen .
The biological significance of sigma receptors in the immune system is poorly understood .
However , Liu et al .
( 12 ) , using a panel of sigma ligands , demonstrated a high correlation between drug binding potency at sigma sites and inhibition of splenocyte proliferation , suggesting that sigma receptors may function as immunoregulators .
SR 31747A was first described by Paul et al .
( 13 ) as a ligand able to compete with a very high potency with all known sigma ligands and to inhibit mitogen-induced mouse and human T cell proliferation with a potency similar to that of cyclosporin A ( 14 ) .
However , unlike cyclosporin A , SR 31747A does not alter early cellular events , but rather interferes at steps further along the pathway leading to proliferation , most probably during the S phase ( 14 ) .
Multiple receptors have been described ( 8 , 15-19 ) .
Sigma 1 designates a high affinity binding site , which is stereoselective for ( + ) -optical enantiomers of pentazocine , SKF 10,047 , and 3- ( 8-hydroxyphenyl ) -N- ( 1-propyl ) -piperidine ( 3-PPP ) .
* Sigma 2 refers to a site that binds these drugs with lower affinity , and which is selective for ( - ) -optical enantiomers of pentazocine , SKF 10,047 , and 3-PPP .
A lower affinity sigma 3 site has been reported in rat and guinea pig brain ( 20 ) .
More recently , a novel binding site was discovered that binds all sigma ligands with two notable exceptions : haloperidol and 1,3-di ( 2-tolyl ) guani-dine ( 21 , 22 ) .
Pharmacological studies with SR 31747 can not discriminate among sigma 1 , sigma 2 , sigma 3 , and the novel sigma/ opioid binding sites since multiple types of sigma receptors can coexist on cells ( 19 ) .
Moreover , the cross-reactivity of many drugs that bind with high affinity to other receptors has impeded efforts to define precisely the sites for SR 31747A binding .
Recently , we examined the effect of this drug in the yeast * The abbreviations used are : 8-PPP , 8- ( 8-hydroxyphenyl ) -N- ( 1-pro-pyl ) -piperidine ; mAb , monoclonal antibody ; SR-BP , SR 31747A-binding protein ; BSA , bovine serum albumin ; RACE , rapid amplification of cDNA end ; PCR , polymerase chain reaction ; PBS , phosphate-buffered saline ; SKF 10,047 , norallylmetazocine ; PAGE , polyacrylamide gel elec-trophresis ; bp , base pair ( s ) .

We showed that SR 31747 arrested cell proliferation by inhibiting an enzyme of the sterol biosyn-thetic pathway , namely C8-C7 sterol isomerase ( 23 ) .
In the present work , we undertook a biochemical characterization of a molecular entity that specifically binds SR 31747A using [ °PHJSR 31747A as the specific probe and the human T leukemia cell line Ichikawa as the biological source .
We purified the protein carrying the SR 31747A binding site and cloned the corresponding cDNA , which was shown to be homologous to the yeast ERG2 gene .
Expression of SR-BP cDNA in yeast S. cerevisiae led to high affinity binding sites for SR 31747A indistinguishable from mammalian sites .
We also present the tissue distribution and subcellular localization and discuss the structural features of this receptor and its possible functions .

Autoradiog- raphy was performed overnight with an intensifying screen .
Analysis of Subcellular Localization of SR-BP by Confocal Microscopy Cells were fixed overnight with 1 % formaldehyde at 4°C , washed once in PBS , and permeabilized for 10 min with a solution of 0.1 % saponin in PBS containing 1 % BSA .
Biotinylated conjugated anti-SR-BP mAb , and anti-mitochondria M117 or anti-nuclear membrane AE-5 mAbs ( Leinco Technologies Inc. , St. Louis , MO ) were simultaneously incubated with cells in the 0.1 % saponin , 1 % BSA solution for 30 min at room temperature .

Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 pl of glycerol containing the anti-bleaching reagent DABCO at 50 mg/ml .
A laser-scanning confocal microscope ( LSM410 , Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) equipped with a planapo oil ( X 63 ) immersion lens ( numerical aperture = 1.4 ) was used to analyze the three-dimen-sional distribution of SR-BP as described previously ( 31 ) .

Cells were cultured in complete medium for 4 days in the presence of various concentrations of SR 81747 or ( + ) -pentazocine , then pulsed with 1 pCi/well [ *HIthymidine ( Amersham , les Ulis , France ) , and harvested 4 h later on glass fiber papers using a Skatron harvester system ( Pharmacia ) .
Incorporated radioactivity was measured by using a Betaplate liquid scintillation spectrometer ( Pharmacia ) .
RESULTS Purification of Human SR-BP-Results of SR-BP purifica- tion from human T leukemia Ichikawa cells are summarized in Table I .
From the solubilized membrane preparation , the binding activity was eluted as a single peak with DEAE anion exchange chromatography .
A straightforward enrichment of SR-BP was obtained using Mono Q gel followed by Q Hyper D gel .
The apparent size of SR-BP determined by gel filtration gave a value of approximately 100 kDa ( Fig .
1 ) , whereas electrophoresis revealed several bands between 80 and 100 kDa and a band close to 30 kDa ( Fig .
2 , lane 5 ) .
At this stage , the enriched SRBP preparation was used to immunize animals to generate specific monoclonal antibodies against SR-BP for further purification .
We developed a screening test for antibody detection , taking advantage of the fact that the binding of [ PHJSR 31747A to partially purified SR-BP was not dissociated upon gel filtration chromatography .
As shown in Fig .
1 , Q Hyper D fraction incubated with [ PHJSR 31747 gave a single radioactive peak associated with eluted proteins .
We used this property to prepare a [ °PH ] JSR 31747A/SR-BP complex ( tritiated antigen ) for radio-immunoassay to detect antibody specific to SR-BP .
The hybri-doma 30G10 producing the antibody with the highest affinity was selected ; antibodies were produced in mice , purified , and linked to CNBr-Sepharose .
The subsequent immunopurifica-tion step drastically improved the purity of SR-BP ( Table I ) since only a single band of 28 kDa could be detected by silver staining and immunobloting ( Fig .
2 ) .
In the purified preparation , the SR 31747 binding activity was enriched 914-fold over the crude digitonin extract .
This preparation was used for partial amino acid sequencing .
SR-BP eDNA Cloning-To isolate the human SR-BP-encod-ing cDNA , we used the trypsic peptides obtained from the purified human SR-BP protein .
Based on amino acid sequence of the longest peptide , reverse transcriptase-PCR and then 5 RACE experiments led us to clone a 320-bp fragment .
This fragment was then used to screen an oligo ( dT ) -primed Daudi cDNA library in A UniZAP phage .
The cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the largest clone are shown in Fig .
3 .
This cDNA contained a 669-bp open reading frame with untranslated regions of 74 bp at the 5'-end , 906 bp at the 3'-end , and a consensus polyadenylation signal ( AATAAA ) 16 bp upstream from the poly ( A ) tail .
Translation of this open reading frame yielded a 223-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24.8 kDa .
Comparisons to the GenBank data base revealed that human SR-BP displayed 93 % amino acid sequence identity with the predicted amino acid sequence of a guinea pig protein called 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 27110 1- 20 8 4 5 Q/ ¢ ¢ \|/ Q/ -70 ( 16 0,04 - 7 baa 12 I 0,03 - i - 102 & E - s 2 s 0,02 - a S -o 0,01 - |- 2 0,00 - - o min Fic .

In addition , a significant homology ( 29.9 % amino acid sequence identity ) was found with the product of the gene ERG2 , a fungal gene encoding a sterol isomerase ( 34 ) .
It is noteworthy that we have already shown that ERGZP is the molecular target of SR 31747A in yeast ( 23 ) .
The three proteins shared the same hydropathy plot , including a highly hydrophobic domain located at the N terminus , with a second stretch of hydrophobic amino acids located in the middle of these proteins .
Multiple alignments showed that this domain is highly conserved among human SR-BP , guinea pig sigma 1 receptor , and the ERG2 gene product from yeast S. cerevisiae as well as from other fungi ( Magnaportae grisea , Ustilago maydis , Neurospora crassa ) ( Fig .
4 ) .
SR-BP Expression-We next investigated SR-BP functions by first transfecting SR-BP cDNA in a different host cell .

The asterisk denotes the termination codon .
as host to express SR-BP .
Untransformed EMY47 cells did not detectably display any SR-BP binding sites .
In contrast , SRBP -expressing cells exhibited SR 31747A binding sites at a high level .
Flow cytometry analysis showed a marked labeling in SR-BP -expressing cells ( data not shown ) .
These results confirmed that the cDNA sequence encoded the SR-BP protein .
Analysis of the SR-BP transcript expression by Northern blotting identified a major band of 2 kilobases ( Fig .
5A ) .
The human tissues that contained the highest amount of human SR-BP mRNA were liver along with colon , prostate , placenta , small intestine , heart , and pancreas .
SR-BP mRNA is also present at a slightly lower level in spleen , lung , thymus , ovary , peripheral blood leukocytes , and brain .
These observations were confirmed in the human Master Blot ( Fig .
5B ) .
Subcellular distribution of SR-BP was examined in the human promonocytic cell line THP1 by immunological analysis using confocal microscopy .
Cells were simultaneously labeled with anti-SR-BP mAb and mAbs specific for different subcellular organelles .
We clearly observed SR-BP localized in association with the nuclear envelope ( Fig .
6 ) .
This localization was also observed on a variety of different cell types including freshly isolated lymphocytes and monocytes .
Another localization was found in the cytosol distinct from mitochondria ( Fig .
6 ) and might be the endoplasmic reticulum .
Pharmacological Characterization of SR-BP-We studied the binding properties of human SR-BP expressed in yeast and compared it to the S. cerevisice ERG2 gene product ( Erg2p ) .
Binding assays were performed in transformed cells of the ERG2 disruptant strain EMY47 , which produce either Erg2p ( control ) or SR-BP .
SR 31747A binding assays were also carried out on purified SR-BP .
A variety of competing compounds were tested , including drugs with high affinity for sigma receptors as well as compounds known to bind yeast sterol isomerase ( Table II ) .
Among the various molecules tested , the rank order of drug potency at SR 31747 sites was : tridemorph = fenpropimorph > SR 31747A > haloperidol > ( + ) -pentazocine > ifenprodil .

Only minor decreases in affinity were observed for haloperidol and ifenprodil , instead of major decreases for ( + ) -pentazocine , which could be related to a difference in protein conformation .
Comparable ranking of tested ligands was observed with Erg2p : tridemorph = fenpropimorph > haloperidol > SR 31747A > ifenprodil .
Nevertheless , a major difference in the pharmacology of SR-BP and Erg2p is that ( + ) -pentazocine inhibited the binding of [ PH ] JSR 31747A to SR-BP ( IC ; , = 18 nM ) but not to Erg2p ( IC ; ; , > 1000 nx ) .
We therefore examined the binding of [ *H ] pentazocine to Erg2p and SR-BP .

As shown in Table II , the binding profile of [ °H ] pentazocine to membraneous SR-BP corresponded to a typical sigma 1 profile : ( + ) -pentazocine and ( + ) -SKF 10,047 having , respectively , a 43-fold and > 33-fold higher affinity than their ( - ) -counterparts .
Unlike ( + ) -pentazocine and haloperidol , the sigma ligands 1,3-di ( 2-tolyl ) guanidine , ( + ) -3-PPP , and ( + ) -SKF 10,047 were unable to displace [ °HJSR 31747A .
We also noted a low efficiency of inhibition in the case of the sigma 1 ligand emopamil .
Scatchard plot analysis ( Fig .
7A ) for membraneous SR-BP using [ PHJSR 31747A as labeled ligand revealed a single high affinity site with a K , value of 0.15 nm and a B , , , , of 6195 fmol/mg protein .
In these experiments , ( + ) -pentazocine acted as a competitive ligand ( increased K , with unchanged B , , , ) .
Comparatively , [ °H ] ( + ) -pentazocine ( Fig .
7B ) bound with high affinity to a single population of sites ( K , , = 7.1 nM and B , , , , = 3860 fmol/mg protein ) .
SR 31747A used at the concentration of 2 nM was competitive to this site ( K , = 11.7 nm and Bu.. , = 3977 fmol/mg protein ) .
The affinity of [ PHJSR 31747A for the SR-BP site was 50- fold higher compared with that of [ PH ] ( + ) -pentazocine .
We have shown previously ( 14 ) that SR 31747 is active at inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation while pentazocine is inac-tive .
Since pentazocine does not block T lymphocyte proliferation while it prevents [ °HJSR 31747A binding , if SR 31747A is acting through SR-BP to block T lymphocyte mitogenesis , pentazocine should thereby prevent SR 31747 inhibition .
We hence analyzed the effect of SR 31747 on cell growth in the absence or presence of pentazocine .
As shown in Fig .
8A , cellular proliferation was inhibited by SR 31747 and restored in the presence of increasing pentazocine concentrations ( Fig .
8B ) .
Although it is not known whether pentazocine could completely reverse the SR 31747 effect due to the high pentazocine concentration-induced toxicity , this observation strongly suggests that the SR 31747A antiproliferative effects could be mediated by SR-BP .
DISCUSSION SR 31747 is an immunomodulating agent eliciting high affinity for sigma receptors .
It demonstrates immunosuppressive properties both in vitro and in vivo ( 14 ) .
This compound , which blocks the proliferation of lymphocytes at nanomolar concentrations , displays a spectrum of activity distinct from current immunosuppressive agents ( 35 ) .

ies suffered from a lack of information on the binding protein involved to relate the observed effects to a biochemical process ( 36 ) .
In an attempt to decipher this , we have purified , cloned , sequenced , and expressed the SR-BP .
We also studied the tissue distribution , subcellular localization , and pharmacological properties of this protein .
Molecular Characterization of SR-BP-Partial purification of the digitonin-solubilized SR-BP from cells of the human T leukemic Ichikawa cell line was achieved by three successive ion-exchange chromatographic steps followed by a gel filtra-tion .
The specific activity obtained was 510 pmol/mg of protein , representing a 160-fold increase over the specific activity of the crude extract .
This preparation was used to generate a monoclonal antibody anti-SR-BP , which in turn enabled the subsequent purification of SR-BP .
Immunopurified SR-BP was used for partial amino acid sequence analyses , after which the corresponding cDNA was cloned .
The nucleotide sequence of the SR-BP cDNA encodes a 223-amino acid protein .
Furthermore , the characterization of the heterologous expression of the SR-BP cDNA in yeast demonstrates that the cloned cDNA encodes a protein that has a high affinity [ °HJSR 31747A-binding domain and is specifically recognized by anti SR-BP-antibodies .
In the course of this study , we cloned the guinea pig and human sigma 1 receptor cDNA and found a 93 % and 100 % 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 27114 amino acid sequence identity , respectively , with SR-BP ( 82 , 33 ) .
We discuss below successively ( i ) the relationship of SR-BP and sigma 1 receptor , and ( ii ) the relationship of SR-BP and Erg2p .
Comparison of SR-BP and Sigma 1 Receptor-The sigma 1 receptor was recently purified and characterized from guinea pig liver by Hanner et al .
( 82 ) ( see , for review , Moebius et al .
( 37 ) ) .
The high degree of homology between the two proteins suggests that it could be the guinea pig counterpart of human SR-BP .
We show here that the SR 31747 binding profile fits with the pharmacological definition of sigma 1 receptor : 1 ) SR-BP binds the sigma ligands , pentazocine and haloperidol with high affinity ; 2 ) only one stereoisomer of pentazocine efficiently competed for [ PH ] JSR 31747A-labeled sites , which is a trait characteristic of the sigma 1 receptor previously characterized in rat spleen ( 10 , 11 , 12 ) .
Our results obtained with ®H ] pentazocine are in line with those of Hanner et al .
( 32 ) on the sigma 1 receptor from guinea pig .
From saturation studies with SR 31747 and ( + ) -pentazocine binding on SR-BP , we concluded that both ligands bound to a single population of sites .
As SR 31747A was competitively displaced by ( + ) -pentazocine and reciprocally , it is very likely that SR 31747A and ( + ) -pentazocine bind the same site .
Nevertheless , B , , , , values ( 6195 and 3860 fmol/mg proteins for SR 31747A and ( + ) -pentazocine , respectively ) were slightly different and the SR 31747 affinity was 50-fold higher than that of ( + ) -pentazocine .
We observed an irreversible ( or very slowly dissociable ) binding of [ PHJSR 31747A at SR-BP .
Comparison between SR-BP and Erg2p-SR-BP shares a significant sequence identity with Erg2p ( 29.9 % ) .
We have shown that this latter protein is the target that mediates the anti-proliferation effects of SR 31747A in yeast ( 23 ) .
Results presented here as well as those of Hanner et al .
( 32 ) show that yeast Erg2p and mammalian sigma 1 receptor or SR-BP , whether of guinea-pig or human source , are related to one another not only structurally but also pharmacologically .
In fact , only pentazocine clearly distinguishes both proteins , whereas SR 31747A , haloperidol , ifenprodil , and drugs of the N-substituted morpholine derivative family , like tridemorph and fenpropimorph , all bind to both proteins with high affinity .
Tridemorph and fenpropimorph are known to inhibit C8-C7 sterol isomerase , as well as other enzymes of the sterol biosyn-thetic pathway , presumably by mimicking the high energy carbocationic reaction intermediate ( 38 ) .
These drugs can therefore be considered as belonging to a non-sterol class of sterol analogs that bind to the reactive sterol-binding pocket of sterol biosynthesis enzymes .
Sequence alignment of the C8-C7 sterol isomerase from S. cerevisiae ( 34 ) , the rice blast fungus M. grisea ( 39 ) , and the maize smut pathogen U. maydis ( 89 ) show a strikingly high percentage of similarity within the central hydrophobic region .
For this reason , this central domain has been suggested to contain the sterol isomerase catalytic site .
Interestingly , SR-BP , which displays a hydropathy profile similar to that of fungal sterol isomerase , also presents this highly conserved central domain .
This observation raises two hypoth-eses : first , the presumably catalytic domain of Erg2p , and the equivalent central hydrophobic domain of SR-BP might contain the sigma ligand binding site .
This could be illustrated by the property of fenpropimorph to competitively inhibit C8-C7 sterol isomerase and other sterol biosynthesis enzymes ( 23 , 38 ) .
The second hypothesis is that SR-BP may exhibit a C8-C7 sterol isomerase activity .
This hypothesis is supported by the high affinity of the sterol isomerase competitive inhibitors tridemorph and fenpropimorph to bind to SR-BP .
However , it is not supported by expression studies in yeast , since no complementation of any of the Erg2p defect , i.e .
CS-sterol accumulation SR 31747A-binding Protein and ergosterol prototrophy , was observed by expressing either the guinea-pig sigma 1 receptor ( 32 ) or the human SR-BP in an ERG2 gene disruptant ( this study ) .
No ergosterol could be detected in pEMR1499-transformed EMY47 cells ( data not shown ) .
We can not exclude that recombinant SR-BP produced in yeast is synthesized in an active form but localized in subcellular compartments where sterol biosynthesis does not take place , as has been suggested in the case of recombinant human squalene synthase ( 40 ) .
Alternatively , the enzymatically active form of SR-BP might require specific post-translation modification events that do not occur in yeast cells .
Finally , one should not exclude that SR-BP function ( s ) might not include the sterol isomerization reaction as performed by Erg2p in yeast .
It is worth noting that we have already cloned a mammalian enzyme by complementation of the Erg2p defect in yeast ( 38 ) .
This microsomal protein displays all the biochemical characteristics expected for mammalian sterol isomerase , including sensitivity to drugs that specifically inhibit the activity of this enzyme in mammals ( 38 ) .
Surprisingly , this enzyme is absolutely not related phylogenetically to Erg2p or SR-BP ; it does not share any striking structural similarity with any members of the Erg2p family including SR-BP .
However , mammalian sterol isomerase does contain a sigma ligand binding site ( 32 , 38 ) .
This observation supports the hypothesis that the sterol-binding pocket present in sterol isomerase , whether belonging to the Erg2p family or not , indeed constitutes the sigma ligand binding site .
It also suggests that other sterol metabolism enzymes might present sigma ligand binding sites as well .
Distribution and Subcellular Localization of SR-BP-The tissular distribution of human SR-BP mRNA revealed a major transcript of 2 kilobases , which was found to be ubiquitous , although its abundance varied among tissues .
The transcript was most abundant in the liver , and lower in brain .
This latter observation clearly contrasts with the high expression level of sigma 1 receptor mRNA in brain guinea pig reported by Hanner et al .
( 32 ) .
This suggests a major difference in tissue expression of sigma 1 receptor or SR-BP in guinea pig and human .
Further investigations using specific anti-SR-BP antibodies are required to document this in particular to interpret the neurological activities of sigma ligands in rodent and human .
In cells expressing SR-BP , the subcellular localization using specific monoclonal antibodies showed that SR-BP is always associated with the nuclear envelope , strongly suggesting that SR-BP is an ubiquitous component of the nuclear membrane .
We also observed that , when the nuclear envelope disassembles at the onset of mitosis and reassembles at the end of mitosis , the SR-BP follows the same dynamics ( data not shown ) .
Our finding of a subcellular localization of SR-BP in nuclear membrane was substantiated by the presence of a hydrophobic domain near the N terminus .
The cytosolic localization , which was also observed , was different from one cell line to another and remains to be further explored .
Within the nuclear mem-brane , the lack of recognition of SR-BP by mAbs applied to intact isolated nuclei indicates that the epitope recognized by the mAb is not exposed to the cytoplasm .
However , further investigations are required to determine whether SR-BP belongs to the inner or outer nuclear membrane .
Biological Effect of SR 31747A and SR-BP-We have shown previously that SR 31747A blocks T lymphocyte proliferation .
Several findings from this study support the possibility that SR 31747A effects are mediated by SR-BP .
1 ) We showed the presence of SR-BP in immune tissue at the mRNA level .
The expression of the protein in purified T cells as well as in macrophages was also demonstrated by flow cytometry using an anti-SR-BP antibody ( data not shown ) .
These 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog SR 31747A-binding Protein results are in agreement with recent studies from Wolfe et al .
( 22 ) , who showed , using in vitro receptor autoradiography in frozen sections of rat spleen , that sigma 1 receptors were present throughout the spleen and particularly concentrated in the T cell zones .
2 ) We demonstrated that the effect of SR 31747 on T cell proliferation was blocked by the competitive ligand ( + ) -pentazocine .
This finding is consistent with a sigma 1 receptor-mediated event .
Although the clear definition of agonist and antagonist at the sigma 1 receptor is difficult , these results suggest that SR 31747A and pentazocine display opposite biological effects .
We have already established that SR 31747 affects a late event in the activation process of T lymphocytes which occurs during the S/G ; y/M phases of the cell cycle ( 14 ) .
This suggests that the function of SR-BP could be essential for T lymphocyte mitogenesis .
Furthermore , and taking into account ( i ) the nuclear membrane localization of SR-BP , ( ii ) the dramatic changes in nuclear membrane during mitosis , ( iii ) the homology of SR-BP with sterol isomerase , and ( iv ) the known effects of cholesterol on the activity of membrane proteins , one may speculate that some of the effects of SR 31747¥ on T cell mitogenesis could be mediated by changes in membrane lipids .
Even though our study does not definitively prove that SR-BP is the site through which SR 31747A modulates immune functions , we can not rule out that SR 31747A could be effective through other sites not yet identified .
An accurate structure-activity relationship study should help to elucidate such an important question .
In conclusion , we have identified and characterized a high affinity binding protein for SR 31747 and shown that this protein is the human sigma 1 receptor .
We also demonstrated that both binding and activity of SR 31747 could be reversed by ( + ) -pentazocine .
This important property strongly suggests that the sigma 1 receptor displays biological functions and provides new tools for further mechanistic investigations .
