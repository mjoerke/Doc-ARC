However , it is unclear whether similar molecular mechanisms underlie transcription of the two genes .
We have previously shown that the transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed in Th2 but not Th1 cells and is crucial for activation of the IL-5 promoter by different stimuli .
In a different study , GATA-3 was shown to be sufficient for the expression of IL-4 and other Th2 cytokine genes .
Here , we show that ectopic expression of GATA-3 is sufficient to drive IL-5 but not IL-4 gene expression .
Also , in Th2 cells , antisense GATA-3 RNA inhibits IL-5 but not IL-4 promoter activation .
The induction of IL-5 gene expression by GATA-3 involves high affinity binding of GATA-3 to an inverted GATA repeat in the IL-5 promoter .
- The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 161 : 3817-3821. n both humans and mice , activated CD4 * T cells can be classified generally into two subsets , Th1 and Th2 , based on their biologic functions , which , in turn , depend on the cytokines they produce ( 1-4 ) .
These distinct populations of helper T cells are intimately associated with the pathophysiology of different diseases including infectious , autoimmune , and asthma/allergic diseases ( 1 , 5 , 6 ) .
Th1 cells secrete IL-2 and IFN-y and are important for protective cell-mediated immune responses against in-tracellular microbes , but they can also cause tissue injury in autoimmune diseases ( 3 , 6 ) .
Th2 cells , on the other hand , secrete IL-4 and IL-5 and protect against parasitic infections but promote asthma and other allergic diseases ( 7 ) .
While IL-4 stimulates IgE production , IL-5 promotes eosinophilic inflammation in the airways of asthmatics .
It appears that the differentiation of naive CD4 * T cells along the Th1 or Th2 pathway triggers different molecular events resulting in the differential expression of particular transcription factors in the two cell types .

E-mail address : Anuradha.Ray @ yale.edu Copyright © 1998 by The American Association of Immunologists the transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed in Th2 but not Th1 cells and is critical for IL-5 gene expression ( 8 ) .
In a different study , GATA-3 was shown to be important and sufficient for the expression of other Th2 cytokine genes including IL-4 , IL-6 , and IL-10 ( 9 ) .
In these studies , ectopic expression of GATA-3 in the B cell line M12 was shown to be sufficient for activation of a minimal IL-4 promoter in the presence of phorbol ester and ionomycin ( 9 ) .
However , the GATA site ( s ) in the IL-4 promoter that conferred GATA-3-responsiveness was not characterized in this study ( 9 ) .
In the same study , the authors also showed that expression of antisense GATA-3 in Th2 cells affected IL-4 gene expression more than IL-5 gene expression ( 9 ) .
To sort out the apparently differential dependence on GATA-3 for IL-5 vs IL-4 gene expression , we attempted to define the GATA site ( s ) in the minimal IL-4 promoter that responded to GATA-3 in the studies reported by Zheng and Flavell ( 9 ) .
Our studies show that ectopic expression of GATA-3 alone can support IL-5 but not IL-4 gene induction in non-Th2 cells such as B cells .
Materials and Methods Transfection assays Rested D10 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously ( 8 ) .
After electroporation , the cells were left on ice for 10 to 30 min , diluted to 5 ml with fresh medium , and incubated at 37°C with or without anti-CD3 ( at 10 ug/ml in wells coated with the Ab ) , Ag + APC ( 8 ) , dibutyryl cAMP ( bt , cAMP® ; 1 mM ) + PMA ( 25 ng/m ! )
( for IL-5 promoter-reporter constructs ) , or ionomycin ( 1 um ) + PMA ( 100 ng/ml ) ( for the IL-4 promoter-reporter constructs ) .
Cells were harvested for reporter gene assays as described previously ( 8 ) .
For M12 cell transfections , cells were grown in RPMI 1640 , and at 10 h before transfection , the cells were transferred to fresh medium .
Electroporation conditions were the same as for D10 cells .
After electroporation , the cells were left in fresh medium for 2 h. The cells were left with or without the appropriate stimuli for ~15 h and harvested for reporter gene assay .
The Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) -B-galactosidase plasmid could not be used to monitor transfection efficiency in M12 cells , since phorbol ester stimulates multiple promoter/enhancers including RSV and CMV promoters in M12 cells .
For assessing cytokine production , 5 X 10° cells were electroporated with a total of 15 ug of DNA containing 10 ug of expression vector containing GATA-3 cDNA in either the sense ( S ) or antisense ( AS ) orientation .
Cells were left overnight at 37°C , and dead cells were removed by Ficoll density gradient centrifuga-tion .
An equal number of live cells from each group was split equally ( 8 X 10° cells per condition ) and either left untreated or treated with PMA+ bt , cAMP or with PMA + ionomycin for 30 h. Supernatants were collected for ELISAs ( Endogen , Cambridge , MA ) ; the lower limit of detection for both cytokines was 5 pg/ml .
Nuclear extracts prepared from cell pellets were used in EMSAs .

Results Antisense GATA-3 RNA expression inhibits IL-5 but not IL-4 promoter activation in Th2 cells In our previous studies , we showed that a 1700-bp IL-5 promoter containing a mutation in a double GATA-3-binding site ( located between -70 and -60 in the promoter ) is completely unresponsive to either antigenic stimulation or stimulation with PMA + bt , cAMP in the prototypic murine Th2 clone , D10 ( 8 ) .
In a separate study , Zheng and Flavell showed that expression of antisense GATA-3 RNA in D10 cells only partially inhibits IL-5 gene expression but has a more pronounced effect on IL-4 gene expression ( 9 ) .
One possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between our data and those of the other investigators is that GATA-3 binds with different affinities to target GATA sites in the IL-5 and IL-4 promoters .
To test this hypothesis , we attempted to define the GATA site ( s ) in the IL-4 promoter that was responsible for GATA-3-dependent activation of the promoter in the studies reported by Zheng and Flavell ( 9 ) .
For a head-to-head comparison between the effects of antisense GATA-3 RNA expression on IL-4 and IL-5 promoter activation , D10 cells were transiently transfected with an IL-5 promoter-reporter plasmid or an IL-4 promoter-reporter plasmid together with a mammalian expression vector containing the full length cDNA for GATA-3 , cloned in the antisense ( AS ) orientation under the control of the RSV promoter/enhancer .
As shown in Figure 1 , expression of antisense GATA-3 RNA inhibited anti-CD3-induced IL-5 promoter activity by ~40 % but had no effect on IL-4 pro moter activity .
The control expression vector transcribing the coding strand ( S ) of GATA-3 did not have this effect .
The likely explanation for incomplete inhibition of IL-5 promoter activation by this approach is the high basal expression of GATA-3 mRNA ( and protein ) in D10 cells .
Therefore , if the IL-5 GATA site has a high affinity for GATA-3 , residual GATA-3 activity in the cells expressing antisense GATA-3 RNA may be sufficient to support par-tial , if not full , activation of the IL-5 promoter .
In fact , in the studies reported by Zheng and Flavell , cells stably expressing antisense GATA-3 RNA had significant residual GATA-3 protein levels and could efficiently support IL-5 but not IL-4 gene expression ( 9 ) .
Ectopic expression of GATA-3 in B cells supports IL-5 but not IL-4 gene expression Since the antisense GATA-3 RNA expression studies failed to provide any evidence for a GATA 3-responsive DNA sequence in the ~800-bp IL-4 promoter , we used a more direct approach to test the ability of GATA-3 to activate the IL-4 promoter .
GATA-3 was ectopically expressed in the murine B cell lymphoma line M12 , and the cells were cotransfected with either an IL-4 or an IL-5 promoter-reporter construct .
When the IL-5 promoter was tested in this system , a small 2- to 4-fold activation was typically observed with PMA + bt , cAMP alone in the absence of GATA-3 expression ( Fig .
24 ) .
In the presence of GATA-3 and PMA + bt , cAMP , an increase in IL-5 promoter activity was observed in a dose-dependent fashion with a net 30- to 40-fold activation with the highest dose of GATA-3 expression vector ( Fig .
24 ) .
This finding was in keeping with our earlier studies in other non-IL-5-producing cell lines , such as HeLa and the Th1 clone A.E7 , in which GATA-3 expression permitted activation of the IL-5 promoter ( 8 ) .
However , when the 800-bp IL-4 promoter was transfected with the GATA-3 expression vector and the cells were stimulated with PMA + iono-mycin , no activation of the promoter was observed ( Fig .
2B ) .
A shorter IL-4 promoter ( -157 to +68 ) that was reported to be responsive to GATA-3 in these cells ( 9 ) was also unreponsive in our assays ( Fig .
2B ) .
The shorter promoter had a much higher basal 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology B Cell ( M12 ) g un E GATA-3 ( 8 ) GATA-3 ( AS ) L 5 wt.IL-5 ( -1700/ +24 ) L2 ee I ] GATA-3 ( S ) GaTA-3 ( A9 ) wt.IL-4 ( -157/ +68 ) nme l= ] GATA-3 ( S ) GATA-3 ( A9 ) wt .

Ectopic expression of GATA-3 is sufficient to activate the IL-5 but not the IL-4 promoter in M12 cells .
M12 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids ( 10 pg of total DNA ) .
Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with or without PMA + bt2cAMP ( for the IL-5 pro-moter-luciferase construct ) or with PMA + ionomycin ( for the IL-4 promoter-reporter constructs ) .

activity in the cells .
Use of lower amounts of the reporter construct led to activation of the promoter by PMA + ionomycin alone ( data not shown ) , which was not reflective of the response of the en-dogenous gene in the B cells .
Even at 20 ug of the expression vector , we detected only a 2-fold increase in the basal activity of the 157-bp promoter and no further increase upon stimulation of the cells ( data not shown ) .
We also investigated the effect of GATA-3 expression on en-dogenous cytokine production in M12 cells .
As illustrated in Figure 3A , M12 cells stimulated with PMA + bt , cAMP and expressing GATA-3 sense but not antisense RNA displayed an impressive induction of IL-5 production .
In contrast , while there was a small increase in the basal level of IL-4 production by cells expressing the sense GATA-3 RNA , the net production of IL-4 by the M12 cells was very little whether the cells expressed GATA-3 sense or antisense RNA , even upon stimulation with PMA + ionomycin .
The expression of GATA-3 in the M12 cells was comparable to expression in D10 cells as judged by EMSA ( Fig .
3B ) .
Thus , it appears that GATA-3 expression in a non-Th2 environment is insufficient for IL-4 gene expression but is sufficient for IL-5 gene expression .
Both of the individual GATA elements in the double GATA site in the IL-5 promoter are important for activation of the promoter by GATA-3 We previously described the presence of a double GATA site in the IL-5 promoter , located between -70 and -60 , which bound 3819 A B Cell ( M12 ) 300 m Qun CJ un EPMA+bt , cAMP H P+ a 200 .

B , Nuclear extracts prepared from the transfected M12 cells were used in EMSA , and the same amount of protein ( 0.25 ug ) was loaded in each lane .

GATA-3 , and was critical for activation of the promoter by multiple stimuli ( 8 , 11 ) .
In a more recent study , Lee et al .
also demonstrated a crucial role for this GATA site in IL-5 promoter activation in Th2 cells ( 10 ) .
Here , we show that both of the GATA elements are important for IL-5 promoter activity in Th2 cells .
Similar to a mutation affecting both the GATA elements ( mut 3 ) , mutation of either element ( mut 1 or mut 2 ) in the context of the 1700-bp promoter abolished promoter activity ( Fig .
44 ) .
As we reported previously ( 8 , 11 ) , while a promoter containing a mutation in the activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) -like site within the CLEO element located between -53 and -39 was totally inactive , one containing a mutation in an NF-AT element was fully active in these assays .
In our previous studies we showed that the double GATA site forms two complexes ( I and II ) with nuclear proteins isolated from either D10 cells or from in vitro-differentiated murine CD4* T cells ( 8 ) .
To further characterize the two DNA-protein complexes , we allowed in vitro-translated GATA-3 to interact with the IL-5 GATA doublet and analyzed the binding reaction in EMSAs along with binding reactions set up with nuclear extracts prepared from anti-CD3-stimulated D10 cells .
As shown in Figure 4B , complex I comigrated with the complex formed with the in vitro-translated protein and most likely represents interactions with the GATA-3 homodimer .
Complex II probably contains heterodimeric GATA-3 .
In accordance with the functional data presented in Figure 4A , the formation of complexes I and II required both GATA elements .

nonspecific binding .
This complex did not contain GATA-3 since its formation could not be supershifted/inhibited by the anti-GATA-3 Ab .
Taken together , the functional studies and the DNA-binding experiments suggest that both GATA elements within the doublet contribute to activation of the IL-5 promoter by GATA 3 .
Discussion The aim of the present study was to define the GATA-3-responsive sequences in the IL-4 promoter and compare the binding affinities of GATA-3 for the functional GATA-3-responsive site ( s ) in the IL-4 and IL-5 promoters .
Although a minimal IL-4 promoter containing sequences between -157 and +68 was previously shown to be dramatically activated ( ~50-fold ) by GATA-3 expression alone in PMA + ionomycin-stimulated M12 cells ( 9 ) , our studies failed to detect any activation of either an ~800 bp IL-4 promoter fragment or the shorter -157/+68 fragment in M12 cells in the presence of GATA-3 and a combination of PMA and ionomycin .
However , in keeping with our earlier observations with two other non-IL-5-producing cell types HeLa and A.E7 ( Th1 ) cells ( 8 ) , ectopically expressed GATA-3 in M12 cells efficiently supported IL-5 promoter activation in a dose-dependent fashion .
IL-5 promoter activation needs at least two DNA elements-the double GATA site and an AP-1-like site within a CLEO element as previously described by us ( 8 , 11 ) .
Since GATA-3 expression alone is sufficient to activate the IL-5 promoter in different cell types when the cells are also stimulated with PMA + bt , cAMP , stimulation of the cells most likely triggers the binding of similar proteins to the AP-1-like site in all cell types .
Using nuclear pro a C & @ R bt bt bo teins derived from either in vitro-differentiated murine Th1 and Th2 cells or from T cell clones , we have shown that the DNA-protein complex formed with the AP-l-like site with either cell extract contains JunB and JunD ( 8 , 11 ) .
Therefore , neither JunB nor JunD appears to be expressed in a Th2-specific fashion .
In fact , both JunB and JunD have been implicated in IL-2 gene transcription in Th1 cells ( 12 ) .
The individual GATA elements in the double GATA site in the IL-5 promoter are present in an inverse orientation with respect to each other and are located between -70 and -65 and between -65 and -60 .
The first sequence conforms with the WGATAR consensus sequence .
The second site has an intact GAT core but has a T instead of A in the +1 position .
However , it appears that this substitution can still be selected by GATA-3 , particularly within overlapping GATA sites ( 13 ) .
Overlapping GATA sites have also been previously identified in many erythroid-expressed genes such as the chicken -globin promoter ( 14 ) .
Overlapping and/or multiple GATA sites appear to confer increased GATA binding activity and may play a key role in differential responsiveness to GATA-3 for different genes ( 14-16 ) .
It is important to note , in this context , that the region between -157 and +68 in the IL-4 promoter does not have any double GATA sites and that the single GATA sites located in this region are not sensitive to GATA-3 activation .
Also , although there is a double GATA site located between -264 and -274 in the IL-4 promoter ( 17 ) , this site is unresponsive to transactivation by GATA-3 .
These two GATA sites ( ~ `` `` *TGATAAGATTA ~* ) are present as direct re-peats , unlike the inverted repeats found in the IL-5 promoter ( Fig .
6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology 3 ) .
In the studies of Ko and Engel , in which binding of GATA-3 to random oligonucleotides was assessed , GATA-3 was found to select oligonucleotides containing inverted GATA repeats much more frequently than those containing GATA sites as direct repeats ( 13 ) .
Thus , our studies lend functional credence to the studies of Ko and Engel ( 13 ) and suggest that sensitivity to GATA-3 is dictated by inverted double GATA sites .
While a direct involvement of GATA-3 in IL-5 promoter activation has been demonstrated in our studies ( 8 ) as well as in those of Lee et al .
( 10 ) , a similar direct role for GATA-3 in IL-4 promoter activation is not evident in our studies .
Therefore , the logical question that arises is how GATA-3 activates IL-4 gene expression in Th2 cells .
Based on the recent reports from various laboratories , it seems likely that IL-4 gene expression needs multiple factors such as c-Maf ( 18 ) , NF-ATe ( 19 , 20 ) , or NF-IL6 ( 21 , 22 ) , which probably act in concert with GATA-3 to induce gene expression .
Interestingly , it was recently shown that although NF-ATe '~/ RAG-1~'~ mice contained a full complement of GATA-3 activity , the mice were deficient in IL-4 gene expression , indicating that the presence of GATA-3 is not sufficient to support IL-4 gene expression ( 20 ) .
It appears that the GATA site that confers responsiveness to GATA-3 in the IL-4 gene is located elsewhere in the IL-4 gene and has yet to be identified .
Indeed , studies of Wenner et al .
indicate that the 800-bp IL-4 promoter lacks sufficient information for maximal expression of the IL-4 gene ( 23 ) .
Thus , collectively it appears that although the IL-4 and IL-5 genes are most often coordinately expressed in Th2-type cells , GATA-3 is sufficient for optimal expression of the IL-5 but not the IL-4 gene .
