and Bice Perussia* From the *Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Jefferson Cancer Institute , Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19107 ; and tDivision of Cellular and Molecular Biology , Dana Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Summary The putative factors that couple the signal transduction from surface receptors to the activation of cytokine synthesis in natural killer ( NK ) cells have not been elucidated .
We report here that the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFATp ) , a cyclosporin A ( CsA ) -sensitive factor that regulates the transcription of several cytokines , mediates CD16-induced activation of cytokine genes in human NK cells .
CD16 ( FeyRIIIA ) -induced expression of cytokine mRNA in NK cells occurs via a CsA-sensitive and Ca*+-dependent mechanism .
Stimulation of NK cells with CD16 ligands induces NFAT-like DNA binding activity in the nuclear extracts from these cells , as detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
This occurs with fast kinetics after stimulation , via a CsA-sensitive and Ca**-dependent mechanism that does not require de novo protein synthesis .
NK cell NFAT is present in the cytosol of nonstimulated cells , migrates to the nucleus upon stimulation , and can associate with AP-1 .
Two distinct molecules , NFATp and NFATe , have been reported to mediate NFAT activity .
The results of supershift assays using NFATp- and NFATe-specific antibodies indicate that NK cell activation early after CD16 ligand binding involves primarily , if not exclusively , NFATp , and Western blot analysis shows that this has the same electrophoretic mobility ( ~120 kD ) as that of T lymphocytes .
NK cells do not express NFAT constitutively , but NFATe mRNA accumulation is induced in these cells within 2 h of stimulation with CD16 ligands .
However , supershift assays using the available mAb recognizing the T cell NFATe revealed no detectable NFAT protein in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from CD16- or phorbol ester-stimulated cells at any time tested , up to 4 h. These results provide the first direct evidence that both CsA-sensitive transcription factors , NFATp and NFATe , are expressed in human NK cells , and that their activation and/or expression can be regulated in primary cells by a single stimulus that , in the case of CD16 in NK cells , results in early activation of NFATp and subsequently induced expression of NFATe mRNA .
K cells play an important role in the early phases of an immune response , mediating cytotoxicity against numerous target cells in the absence of previous sensitization , and producing cytokines ( IFN-y , TNF , GM-CSF , and IL-3 ) .
Both functions are triggered or enhanced upon stimulation with target cells , immune complexes , and lymphokines , each binding to different receptors ( reviewed in references 1-3 ) .
The proximal intracellular events induced upon ligand binding to the transmembrane form of the low affinity receptor for IgG ( CD16 , FcyRIIIA ) !
on NK cells are being elucidated ( 4-8 ) , but no information is available on the distal events 1 Abbreviations used in this paper : Act D , actinomycin D ; B2M , B2 microglobulin ; [ Ca2+ ] ; , intracellular Ca # + concentration ; CsA , cyclosporin A ; E , erythrocytes ; EA , Ab-coated erythrocytes ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; FoyR , receptor for the Fc fragment of IgG ; NFAT , nuclear factor of activated T cells ; NRS , nonimmune rabbit serum ; PDBu , phorbol-12 , 13-dibutyrate ; PKC , protein kinase C. 801 J.

CD16-induced production of cytokines ( e.g .
, IFN-y and TNF ) , but not that of CD25 or other proteins involved in cytotoxicity ( 8-10 ) , depends on increased intracellular Ca # * concentration ( [ Ca** ) ; ) after extracellular Ca # + entrance ( 8 ) .
In T lymphocytes , the TCR-induced increase of [ Ca # * ] ; is also a requisite for the expression of several lymphokines ( reviewed in reference 11 ) , and a pathway has been elucidated which connects the [ Ca®* ] ; increase to the regulation of cytokine transcription via activation of the cytoplasmic serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin A and its subsequent effect on the transcription nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) ( 11-15 ) .
NFAT is present in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells as a phosphoprotein , NFATp , which , dephosphorylated upon cellular stimulation , migrates into the nucleus , where it binds specific DNA sequences in the promoter/ enhancer regions of cytokine genes ( reviewed in references 11 and 16-20 ) .
Originally described as a cyclosporin A ( CsA ) -sensitive factor binding the IL-2 promoter ( 21-23 ) , NFAT also binds NFAT-specific sites in the promoters of other cytokines ( IL-3 , IL-4 , TNF-a , and GM-CSF ) ( 17 , 19 , 20 , 24 , 25 ) , where it may cooperate with other factors , e.g .
, AP-1 ( IL-2 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF promoters ) ( 12 , 17 , 25 ) .
These observations indicate that its activity is not restricted to the regulation of the IL-2 gene .
The distribution of NFAT extends beyond Tx1 lympho-cytes : NFATp is transcriptionally active in B cells ( 26 , 27 ) , where it likely regulates expression of TNF ( 19 , 28 ) .
At least two related but distinct NFAT proteins exist , NFATp and NFAT , that have identical binding specificity and activation requirements ( 29 , 30 ) , and they are expressed in several hematopoietic lineages and other tissues ( 11 , 30 ) .
Unlike NFATp , NFAT is not constitutively expressed in most tissues and cell lines analyzed , but is inducible in lymphocytes by protein kinase C ( PKC ) activators and/or agents that increase [ Ca # * ] ; ( 30 ) .
Its distribution in hematopoietic cell subsets , as well as the physiological stimuli that induce its expression , remain to be elucidated .
We have observed that CD16-induced transcription of TNF and GM-CSF mRNA in NK cells is abrogated by CsA .
This data , coupled with the reported role of NFAT in the transcriptional regulation of several cytokine genes , led us to analyze its expression and regulation in NK cells .
The results presented here indicate that CD16 stimulation in human NK cells sequentially activates NFATp and induces NFATe mRNA accumulation .
The former is readily activated from a preformed inactive cytoplasmic pool , whereas the latter must be synthesized de novo : both events occur in a CsA-sensitive manner and require extracellular but not protein synthesis .
These data indicate a role for NFATp and , possibly , NFATe in mediating CD16-induced expression of cytokine genes in NK cells .

The Ab used recognize both human and murine NFAT .
Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide DNA probes were synthesized in the Nucleic Acid Facility at the Jefferson Cancer Institute ( except for the SP1 and AP-1 probes , purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. , Santa Cruz , CA ) and were end-labeled with [ y*P ] ATP ( specific activity = 4,500 Ci/mmol ; ICN Bio-medicals Inc. , Costa Mesa , CA ) and T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Promega Biotech , Madison , WI ) according to the manufacturer 's specifications .
After labeling , free [ y*P ] JATP was removed by cen-trifugation on Microspin Sephacryl $ -200 HR columns ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Piscataway , NJ ) .
The sequences of the oligonucleotide probes used ( 5 ' to 3 ' , one strand ) are : human IL-2 distal NFAT site ( NFAT hull-2 ) ( 34 ) , GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGA-AGG ; mouse IL-4 NFAT site ( NFAT mIl-4 ) ( 20 , 24 ) , ATAAAA-TTTTCCAATGTAAA ; consensus AP- site ( AP- ) , CGCTTGATG-ACTCAGCCGGAA ; consensus SP1 site ( SP1 ) , ATTCGATCGGTT CGGGGCGAG ; human GM-CSF ( GM-550 , containing an NFAT binding site ) ( 17 ) , TCTTATTATGACTCTTGCITTTCCTCCT TTC ; human TNF ( NF- « 3 , containing an NFAT-binding site ) : CAGATGAGCTCATGGGTTTCTCCACC ( 19 ) ( used in Fig .

Pretreatment of the cells with protein synthesis inhibitors resulted in overexpression of CD16-induced TNF and only minimal inhibition of GM-CSF mRNA accumulation under conditions in which the inhibitory effect of CsA was still evident .

CD16-induced Activation of NFAT .
- 'To determine whether NFAT is expressed in NK cells and is activated upon CD16 stimulation , we performed EMSA with nuclear extracts from CD16-stimulated cells and oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the conserved NFAT distal binding sequences in the human IL-2 , the murine IL-4 , and the human TNF and GM-CSF promoters .
Binding of NFAT to the first probe depends on its association with AP-1 ( 34 , 37 ) , whereas that to the IL-4 probe is independent of other factors ( 20 ) .

sequences in the promoters of cytokines produced by NK cells ( GM-550 from the GM-CSF/IL-3 enhancer [ 17 ] and NF- « 3 from the TNF promoter [ 19 ] ) , but not by SP1 ( containing an unrelated sequence ) , and by excess cold oligonucleotides corresponding to an additional NFAT binding sequence ( NFAT mIl-4 ) or to the AP-1 binding sequence ( Fig .
3 B ) .
In EMSA performed with the labeled NF- « 3 oligonucleotide ( Fig .
3 C ) , a shift was detected that was inhibited by all cold oligonucleotides used that contain NFAT binding sites ( NF- « 3 , NFAT hull-2 , and mIL-4 ) , but not by SP1 .
Similar results were obtained with the labeled GM-550 oligonucleotide ( not shown ) .
Thus , CD16-induced transcription of TNF and GM-CSF correlates with activation of NFAT , the NFAT expressed in NK and T cells have identical DNA binding specificity , and DNA binding activity of both is enhanced upon association with AP-1 .
Protein Synthesis Requirement for CD16-induced NFAT Activation .
- NFAT activation was detected with the NFAT mIL4 ( Fig .
4 , top ) and the NFAT hull-2 , AP-1-dependent , probe ( not shown ) within 15 min stimulation of CD16 , and it was sustained up to 2 h. AP-1 in nuclear extracts from CD16-stimulated NK cells contributed to the observed NFAT binding to the NFAT hull-2 probe ( Fig .
3 B ) ; therefore , we analyzed the in vitro AP-1 activity in the same samples .
In nuclear extracts from the NK cells used here , AP-1 was detectable by EMSA before addition of any stimulus ( time 0 ) .
CD16 stimulation induced AP-1 activity higher than background within 30 min and sustained up to 2 h ( Fig .
4 , bottom ) .
These data indicate that NFAT activation is an early step in the CD16 activation pathway and involves two components detectable in vitro : activation of NFAT on its own and increased AP-1 activity .
To test the hypothesis that the factor ( s ) involved in cytokine gene transcription regulated by CD16 stimulation is ( are ) directly activated from a preformed pool , we analyzed CD16-induced NFAT activation in the absence of de novo protein synthesis .
NFAT activation in NK cells pretreated with emetine ( Fig .

Expression of Cytoplasmic NFAT in Nonstimulated NK Cells .
To determine directly whether CD16 stimulation activates a preformed NFAT pool in nonstimulated NK cells and induces its translocation to the nucleus , we analyzed the presence of NFAT in cytosolic extracts of nonstimulated NK cells .
The NFAT mIL-4 probe detected NFAT in cytoplasmic extracts from these cells ( Fig .
6 A ) , and DNA binding was inhibited by an excess of the same cold probe , but not by the AP-1-dependent NFAT hull-2 or the AP-1 oligonucleo-tides .
As expected , cytoplasmic NFAT was not detectable using the NFAT hull-2 probe ( Fig .
6 A , right panel ) .
A band with mobility faster than that of the NFAT complex was observed with this probe in the cytoplasmic extracts , was not competed with excess cold probe and is likely caused by nonspecific binding .
NFAT binding to the NFAT hull-2 probe was reconstituted ( Fig .
6 B , lane N+C ) when the cytoplasmic extracts ( lane C ) were combined with nuclear extracts ( lane N ) , containing AP-1 ( Fig .
2 and data not shown ) but not NFAT ( Fig .
6 B , lane N ) , prepared from the same nonstimulated NK cells .
Both cold AP-1 and NFAT hull-2 oligonucleotides , but not unrelated oligonucleotides ( not shown ) , efficiently inhibited NFAT binding to the probe .

Identification of NFATp in NK cells .
( 4 ) Nuclear extracts from NK cells , incubated in medium without ( None ) or with EA for 1 h , were analyzed for the presence of NFATp and NFATe using specific antibodies and EMSA in supershift assays .
Before adding the labeled NFAT mIl-4 probe , identical aliquots of the samples ( 3 ug per lane ) were incubated for 15 min without ( - ) or with NRS , mAb B159.5 , IgG1 ( CD56 ) , anti-NFATp rabbit antiserum ( 072 ) , anti-NFATe mAb , IgG1 ( 7A6 ) , or anti-NFATp plus anti-NFATe antibodies ( 72 + 7A6 ) .
In the right panel , NFATp 72 antiserum , preincubated ( 30 min , 4°C ) in medium alone ( - ) , with its cognate peptide ( p72 ) or an irrelevant peptide ( p25 ) , was added to identical aliquots ( 3 ug per lane ) of a nuclear extract from 1-h EA-stimulated NK cells , and the samples were analyzed by EMSA and supershift as described in Materials and Methods .
The first two lanes are aliquots from the same nuclear extract preincubated with no antiserum ( - ) or with a NRS , respectively , and no peptide .
( B ) Identical aliquots ( 3 ug per lane ) of a nuclear extract from 2 x 10 `` 4-h PDBu plus ionomycin ( P/T ) -stimulated Jurkat cells were pretreated with each of the same antibodies as in A and subjected to EMSA .
Antibodies were used at a final dilution of 1/250 from the original serum ( rabbit ) or ascitic fluid ( mouse ) ; peptides were used at 4 ug/ml final concentrations .
NFAT binding to the NFAT mIl-4 probe and the supershift induced in the presence of the Ab are indicated with closed and open arrowheads , respectively .
Two related but distinct proteins , NFATp and NFAT , mediate NFAT binding activity ( 29 , 30 ) .
To analyze the relative contribution of these elements to the NFAT activity in CD16-stimulated NK cells , we used an antiserum against the murine NFATp peptide 72 ( amino acids 206-232 ) ( 29 ) , as well as an mAb to the human NFATe ( mAb 7A6 ) ( 30 ) in supershift experiments .
Most of the NFAT complex detected with the NFAT mIl-4 probe in nuclear extracts from 1-h CD16-stimulated NK cells was supershifted by the anti-NFATp antibody ( Fig .
7 A ) .
Similar results were obtained using anti-NFATp antiserum 67.1 ( 35 ) and nuclear extracts from 30-min and 2-h CD16-stimulated NK cells ( not shown ) .
An irrelevant antiserum ( nonimmune rabbit serum [ NRS ] ) and an isotype-matched anti-CD56 mAb did not affect the relative mobility of the complex , and none of the antibodies bound the DNA probe alone ( not shown ) .
The supershift induced by the anti-NFATp antibody was specifically prevented by the cognate peptide 72 , but not by a different peptide ( peptide 25 , amino acids 685-703 in the murine NFATp ) ( 29 ) .
The anti-NFATe mAb 7A6 induced no detectable supershift ( Fig .
7 A ) , nor did it increase the amount of supershifted complex when combined with the 72 Ab .
Consistent with these results , NFATe was detected neither in nuclear extracts from short-term stimulated cells nor in cytosolic preparations of nonstimulated or 4-h stimulated NK cells ( not shown ) .
On the contrary ( Fig .

Whole-cell lysates from PHA blasts ( T ) , NK , or COS-7 cells were resolved in SDS-PAGE ( 7.5 % acrylamide , reducing conditions ) .
Western blot analysis was performed with the anti-NFATp rabbit antiserum 067.1 ( left panel , eNFATp ) and a nonimmune rabbit serum ( right panel , NRS ) as control , followed by ECL detection , as described in Materials and Methods .
The T and NK cell samples were from 2 x 105 cells , the COS cell sample was from 10 % cells ; antisera were used at a 2 x 10- final dilution .

7 B ) , the anti-NFATe mAb efficiently supershifted the NFAT complex in nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells or from PHA lymphoblasts ( not shown ) stimulated for 4 h with PDBu/ ionomycin , conditions in which NFATe is induced and activated in these cells ( 30 ) .
Only a small portion of the complex was supershifted by the anti-NFATp antibody in the Jurkat T cell line .
These results confirm that the antibodies do not detect cross-reactive determinants in the two NFATp .
SDS-PAGE of total lysates from non stimulated NK cells followed by Western blot analysis with the anti-NFATp antiserum 67.1 resolved a specific prominent band of ~120 kD ( Fig .
8 ) , similar in size and relative density to that detected in PHA blast lysates , and corresponding to the phosphorylated ( cytoplasmic ) form of NFATp ( 35 ) .
Bands with lower relative molecular weight detected in both the NK and T cell lysates likely represent partially dephosphorylated NFATp and/or their degradation products .
Consistent with the results from EMSA , NFATe mRNA was undetectable in nonstimulated NK cells ( Fig .
9 ) , but it accumulated at levels significantly higher than background within 2-h stimulation with CD16 ligands .
Induction of its expression was , as previously reported ( 30 ) , CsA-sensitive , and it did not depend on de novo protein synthesis , but depended on RNA synthesis .
To determine whether newly synthesized NFAT contributes to the NFAT activity observed at later times after CD16 stimulation , we analyzed its presence in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from NK cells by EMSA .
NFAT protein was undetectable in nonstimulated cells and in cells stimulated up to 4 h with immune complexes or a combination of phorbol esters and a Ca # +* ionophore .
The anti-NFATe Ab induced supershift when added to nuclear extracts from phorbol ester and ionomycin-treated PHA lymphoblasts and Jurkat T cells , but not when added to NK cell extracts ( not shown ) .

Discussion The results presented here demonstrate that NFAT is expressed in NK cells .
Stimulation of these cells with immune complexes not only results in activation and nuclear translocation of a preexisting cytoplasmic NFATp component identical to that present in T cells , but also induces de novo expression of NFATe mRNA , and the former NFAT is functionally active in regulating cytokine gene expression .
The use of homogeneous NK cell preparations with no detectable T cell contaminants and of stimuli that do not activate T lymphocytes ( 10 ) exclude the participation of T cells in the observed effects .
FcyRIIIA ligands and cytokines , e.g .
, IL-2 and IL-12 , induce transcription of cytokine genes in NK cells .
The IL-2-and IIL-12-induced transcription is Ca** independent ( 8 ) ; that induced upon FeyR stimulation is Ca*+* dependent ( 8 ) .
Our results demonstrate that TNF and GM-CSF ( like IFN-y and c-myc , not shown ) expression is induced upon CD16 stimulation in a CsA-sensitive fashion , independent of protein synthesis , indicating that the effect of both CD16 stimulation and CsA occur at the level of preexisting elements in NK cells .
These data add to previous observations indicating a similarity at the molecular and signal transduction levels between CD16 and the TCR and slg complexes on T and B lymphocytes ( 38 , 39 ) , where the Ca**-dependent , CsA-sensitive factor NFAT is involved in antigen receptor-mediated gene transcription .
In T cells NFAT regulates transcription of IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , GM-CSF , and TNF genes ( 11 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 20 , 40 ) .
Among these genes , at least TNF appears to be similarly regulated in B cells , where NFAT is transcriptionally active ( 26-28 , 41 ) .
In NK cells , ligation of FeyRIII with specific mAb or Ag-Ab complexes , its physiologic ligand , activates a nuclear factor that has the same DNA binding specificity as NFAT , this activation , like that of the CD16-induced cytokines , is CsA sensitive and Ca** dependent .
Instead , Ca**-indepen-dent signals transduced by cytokines ( IL-2 ) that induce TNF and GM-CSF expression do not mediate NFAT activation 807 Aramburu et al .
( not shown ) , suggesting that CD16 specifically engages Ca*+*-dependent , CsA-sensitive elements .
Nuclear extracts of CD16-stimulated NK cells contain protein ( s ) that bind specifically NFAT binding sequences present in the enhancer regions of the promoters of several cytokines produced by NK cells , eg .
, TNF , GM-CSF , and IL-3 ( 16 , 17 , 19 ) , and these same sequences compete specifically , and as efficiently as those contained in the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters , for NFAT binding to the distal NFAT IL-2 binding site present in the oligonucleotides used in the EMSA .
This indicates that NK cell NFAT has DNA binding specificity identical to that of its T and B cell counterparts ( 11 , 26 , 27 , 42 ) , and it supports a critical role for NFAT in NK cell transcriptional regulation of these cytokines .
The same data , however , do not exclude the participation of other as yet not identified components in the transcriptional activation of cytokine genes in NK cells , analogous to the necessary , but not sufficient , role of NFAT in the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene promoter in T cells ( 43 ) .
NK cells NFAT can associate with AP-1 , as established using the hull 2 NFAT site .
NFAT binding to this element requires a nuclear component newly synthesized in a PKC-dependent fashion ( 38 , 44 , 45 ) .
This component contains AP-1 , which is formed by various combinations of jun or jun-fos polypep-tides ( 45 , 46 ) .
NFATp-AP-1 interaction results in increased NFATp DNA binding and transcriptional capacity at the recognition sites in the IL-2 promoter and in at least one NFAT site ( CLEO ) of the GM-CSF promoter ( 11 , 25 ) .
AP-1 oligonucleotides inhibited binding of NK cell NFATp to the NFAT hull-2 probe , proving that the factor can associate with AP-1 .
In the NK cells used here , EMSA revealed significant levels of AP-1 activity , and FeyRIII stimulation increased tained this activity for prolonged periods of time .
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of c-jun and jun-D but not jun-B or c-fos before stimulation ( not shown ) , suggesting that complexes containing c-jun and jun-D , known to compose AP-1 ( 45 ) , are preformed in these cells and contribute to the constitutive AP-1 activity .
CD16 stimulation also induces c-fos mRNA accumulation within 20 min ( not shown ) , which may contribute to the sustained AP-1 levels observed after stimulation .
Inhibition of AP-1 synthesis and/or lack of replacement of NFATp with newly synthesized protein might account , at least in part , for the decreased NFAT levels at later times after stimulation in the absence of protein synthesis .
Kinetics of induction of the AP-1-dependent NFAT activity in freshly purified NK cells , however , may not correspond to that reported here , where constitutive AP-1 activity likely reflects previous activation of the cells in the culture system used to obtain large numbers of polyclonal NK cell popula-tions .
Although phenotypically and functionally equivalent to NK cells freshly separated from peripheral blood ( 31 ) , the short-term cultured NK cells revert to a resting state after activation/proliferation in culture , and they respond to several stimuli proliferating and/or producing cytokines with faster kinetics than resting , non-previously activated cells ( 31 , 47 ) .
Cytoplasmic extracts from nonstimulated NK cells contain NFAT , but not AP-1 or AP-1-dependent NFAT activity , as expected since AP-1 is composed of nuclear proteins .
Absence of AP-1 in these extracts also serves to exclude possible artefacts due to contamination with nuclear material .
NFAT was detected in cytosolic extracts of NK cells using the mIl-4 NFAT probe , to which it can bind in the absence of additional factors .
AP-1-dependent NFAT activity detected with the hull 2 probe was reconstituted when nuclear extracts from nonstimulated cells containing no NFAT activity but expressing AP-1 were combined with cytoplasmic preparations from the same cells , indicating association of cytoplasmic NFAT with nuclear AP-1 , and supporting the hypothesis that NFAT activation in NK cells results in its translocation to the nucleus , as reported in T lymphocytes .
These data indicate that cytoplasmic NFATp is preexistent in NK cells , as confirmed by its identification in nonstimulated cells as a protein with antigenic and biochemical characteristics indistinguishable from those of the cytoplasmic , phosphorylated form of NFATp ( 35 ) .
NFATp belongs to a family of factors that include NFATe ( 30 ) and the recently cloned NFATx ( 47 ) , all sharing significant homology , identical DNA binding specificity , and capable of associating with AP-1 ( 29 , 30 , 47 ) .
NFATx mRNA is expressed preferentially in the thymus and at very low levels in peripheral leukocytes .
NFATe expression is inducible by PKC activators in human T cell lines , as well as splenic and thymic cells ( 30 ) .
NFATe mRNA is undetectable in nonstimulated NK cells , but is induced in a CsA-sensitive fashion after a 2-h stimulation with FeyR ligands ( Fig .
9 ) or phorbol esters ( not shown ) .
These data for primary NK cells extend results reported using T cell lines .
Expression of NFATe mRNA is detectable in emetine-treated cells , but not in the absence of de novo RNA synthesis , suggesting that CD16-induced NFAT expression occurs via a mechanism that includes direct or indirect induction of gene transcription , independent from newly synthesized proteins .
Despite the fact that NFATe mRNA was inducible in NK cells , we did not detect NFATe protein , and the NFATe-specific mAb did not induce supershift in nuclear ( Fig .
7 ) or cytosolic ( not shown ) extracts from 1-h stimulated NK cells .
However , the same mAb supershifted the NFAT detected in the Jurkat cell line and in phorbol ester- and ionomycin-stimulated PHA lymphoblasts ( not shown ) , where the combination of both anti-NFATp and anti-NFATe antibodies supershifted virtually all the complex .
Several possibilities may account for the inability of the anti-NFATe mAb to detect this molecule in NK cells .
Based on the observations that NFATe isoforms exist ( Crabtree , G. , personal communication ) and may be differentially expressed in distinct hematopoietic cell lineages , and that the supershift induced by the anti- NFATp antibodies is incomplete , the most likely explanation for these results is that an NFATe isoform or NFAT species different from that detected by the mAb used here is/are expressed in NK cells .
Other possibilities include that the epitope detected by the antibody is masked by a protein ( s ) absent in T cells but present in NK cells , or that the NFATe mRNA transcript induced in NK cells is nonproductive .
However , both possibilities are unlikely because ( a ) the anti-NFATe mAb supershifted the same amount of NFAT in Jurkat cell extracts when tested either separately or mixed with an excess nuclear extract from CD16-stimulated NK cells , where NFATe was undetectable ( not shown ) ; and ( b ) the size of the NFATe mRNA in NK cells is identical to that in T lymphocytes and corresponds to that reported for a productive transcript ( 30 ) .
Our results indicate that NFATp is the most relevant , if not the only , protein included in the NFAT complexes detected in NK cells at early times after CD16 stimulation .
The relative amount of NFATp supershifted varied ( 60-90 % ) in experiments repeated with individual nuclear extracts , suggesting that interexperimental variability may account , in part , for the incomplete supershift .
However , the presence of residual NFAT not supershifted by the available anti-NFATp and -NFATe antibodies may reflect the participation of additional factors ( e.g .
, NFATx or new family members ) with DNA binding specificity overlapping with that of NFATp .
Our data support the conclusion that CD16 stimulation in NK cells induces NFATp activation that likely promotes , in a CsA-sensitive and possibly calcineurin A-dependent fashion , translocation to the nucleus of a preexistent NFATp , identical to that predominant in T cells , although formal proof of the latter awaits nucleotide sequence comparison .
They confirm that the NFATp cytoplasmic component is not specifically and exclusively expressed in T lymphocytes , and they serve to further generalize this conclusion to all lym-phoid and , possibly , most hematopoietic cell types .
In this regard , it will be interesting to determine whether Ab-independent target cell recognition by NK cells , which results in Ca**+-dependent activation of cytokine genes via a mechanism at least in part distinct from that induced via FeyRIIIA ( 49 , 50 ) , can activate NFATp , and which physiologic stimuli are involved in NFAT activation in antigen-presenting cells , e. g. , monocytes ( 11 ) .
The significance of NFATe mRNA induction in NK cells , and the possibility that new species of the NFAT family are expressed in these cells , awaits further study .
Generation of additional antibodies to NFATp and NFAT isoforms and/or , possibly , other NFAT species will help to address the question of the relative contribution of NFAT members to gene expression , not only in NK cells , but also in other immune cell types .
