Gunther , Julie A. Nye , Roger S. Bryner , and Barbara J. Graves Department of Cellular , Viral , and Molecular Biology , University of Utah School of Medicine , Salt Lake City , Utah 84132 USA The ets proto-oncogene family is a group of sequence-related genes whose normal cellular function is unknown .
In a study of cellular proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation of murine retroviruses in T lymphocytes , we have discovered that a member of the ets gene family encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein .
A mouse ets-1 cDNA clone was obtained by screening a mouse thymus cDNA expression library with a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe representing 20 bp of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus ( MSV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .
The cDNA sequence has an 813-bp open reading frame ( ORF ) whose predicted amino acid sequence is 97.6 % identical to the 272 carboxy-terminal amino acids of the human ets-1 protein .
The ORF was expressed in bacteria , and the 30-kD protein product was shown to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner by mobility-shift assays , Southwestern blot analysis , and methylation interference .
A mutant LTR containing four base pair substitutions in the ets-1 binding site was constructed and was shown to have reduced binding in vitro .
Transcriptional efficiency of the MSV LTR promoter containing this disrupted ets-1 binding site was compared to the activity of a wild-type promoter in mouse T lymphocytes in culture , and 15- to 20-fold reduction in expression of a reporter gene was observed .
We propose that ets-1 functions as a transcriptional activator of mammalian type-C retroviruses and speculate that ets-related genes constitute a new group of eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins .

An important first step in understanding the transforming capability of an oncogene is the discovery of the proto-oncogene 's role in normal cellular function .
The ets proto-oncogene family is a collection of sequence-related genes whose function is unknown .
ets family members have been characterized in chicken , ets-1 ( Ge-gonne et al .
1987 ) and ets-2 ( Boulukos et al .
1988 ) ; mouse , ets-2 ( Watson et al .
1988a ) ; human , ets-1 and ets-2 ( Watson et al .
1985 ) , as well as erg-1 [ Rao et al .
1987 ; Reddy et al .
1987 ) and elk-1 and elk-2 ( Rao et al .
1989 } ; and Drosophila , ets-2 ( Priby ] et al .
1988 ) and E74 { Burtis et al .
1990 ) .
These genes are related , in part , on the basis of approximately 300 nucleotides of highly conserved sequence .
It has been speculated that this region of similarity encodes an important functional domain ( Watson et al .
1988a ) .
Clues pertaining to the function of ets-related proteins include evidence for nuclear localization { Fujiwara et al .
1988a ; Boulukos et al .
1989 ; Pognonec et al .
1989 ) and phosphorylation ( Fujiwara et al .
1988b ; Pognonec et al .
1988 ) of ets-1 and ets-2 .
Additional information about this gene family comes from the association of ets-related genes with cell transformation .
The founding member of this gene group , the avian ets-1 gene , is one of the proto-oncogenes transduced by the avian leukosis virus , E26 ( Leprince et al .
1983 ; Nunn et al .
1983 ) .
This virus causes both erythroid and myeloid leukemias ( Radke et al .
1982 ) .
The ets sequences are required for the induction of erythroblastosis [ Nunn and Hunter 1989 ) and appear to also affect the myeloid transformation process ( Golay et al .
1988 ) .
Furthermore , the human ets family members ets-1 , ets-2 , erg , and elk-1 , and elk-2 have been mapped near chromosomal sites involved in translocations that are diagnostic of certain leukemias , lymphomas , and sarcomas ( Sacchi et al , 1986 ; Rao et al .
1989 ) .
Here we report important new insights into the function of the ets gene family that should help to elucidate the oncogenic potential and normal cellular activites of ets-related proteins .
We demonstrate that the mouse ets-1 gene product functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein .

viruses .
First , we mapped the binding sites of thymus proteins that interact with the transcriptional control elements in the long terminal repeat { LTR } ) of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus ( MSV ) .
Next , to clone cDNAs encoding such proteins , a mouse thymus cDNA expression library was probed with double-stranded DNA representing repeats of the LTR binding sites ( Singh et al .
1988 ; Vinson et al .
1988 ) .
We report the cloning of an ets-1 cDNA using this approach .
The data demonstrate that an ets-1-encoded polypeptide binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner .
Furthermore , a promoter that bears a mutated ets-1 binding site and displays reduced ets-1 binding activity in vitro also has a lower transcriptional efficiency than the wild-type LTR promoter in vivo , suggesting that ets-1 functions as a transcriptional activator .
Results Transcriptional elements used by MSV LTR in mouse T lymphocytes Transcriptional control elements of the MSV LTR have been mapped previously in mouse L cells and frog 00-cytes , using deletion mutants of the LTR and transient expression assays ( Graves et al .
1985a , b ) .

To begin to identify lymphoid proteins that are used as retroviral transcription factors , nuclear extracts were prepared from calf thymus glands { an abundant source of T-lymphocyte nuclei ) and assayed for LTR-binding activities by DNase I protection assays .
Figure 1 shows one such activity that protects nucleotides between positions -54 and -33 in the MSV LTR .
This region lies between the CAAT and TATA homologies , two elements that have been shown to function as LTR transcriptional control elements in mouse fibroblasts in cul-ture .
Thymus cDNA library screen To characterize the thymus protein responsible for the DNA-binding activity described above , we screened a cDNA expression library for a clone that produced a similar DNA-binding activity .
A Agtll cDNA library was constructed from polyadenylated RNA of mouse thymus glands and screened with a concatemerized 25-bp oligonucleotide that contains the LTR binding site { wild-type probe , Wt , in Fig .

Characterization of the phage DNA indicated that the single positive cDNA clone represents sequences of the mouse ets-1 gene .
A partial DNA sequence of the cDNA clone was determined by didcoxy sequencing .
The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the Agtll cDNA insert encoded a 271-amino-acid polypeptide ( ex-cluding the adapter codons ) whose sequence is in frame with the B-galactosidase coding region of Agtll .
A terminator codon , TAG , was noted at position 272 .
Comparison of the open reading frame { ( ORF ) sequence with the GenBank DNA sequence data base demonstrated a striking similarity to the human ets-1 gene [ Fig .
2 ) .
There is 92.6 % identity of nucleotide sequences within an 813-bp region ; the ORF translates into a polypeptide sequence showing 97.4 % identity to the 272 carboxy-terminal amino acids of the 54-kD human ets-1 protein .
In contrast , strong similarity to the related mouse ets-2 gene spans only 112 amino acids , which are part of the strongly conserved domain of the entire ets family ( Fig .
2 ; see also Fig .
8 , below } .
Although it is possible that the uncharacterized amino-terminal portion of this new mouse gene product will differ from the human ets-1 amino-terminal sequences , the data base comparisons suggest that the isolated Agt11 clone with LTR-binding properties contains a cDNA of the mouse ets-1 homolog .
The DNA-binding activity of the ets-1 polypeptide The DNA-binding properties of the ets-1 polypeptide clone were analyzed further by subcloning the sequences of the ets-1 ORF into the bacterial expression vector , pET3a ( Rosenberg et al .
1987 ) .
In this construction , pET ets-1 , the ets-1 ORF is in-frame with the sequence encoding 11 amino acids of the T7 $ 10 gene , including the initiator ATG codon .
Cultures of BL21 ( DE3 ] ) bacteria were induced to express the ets-1 ORF , and total bacterial cell extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE .
Figure 3A shows an abundant polypeptide in the expected 30-kD size range whose appearance was dependent on the presence of the ets-1 ORF sequences in the expression vector .
Total cell extracts resolved by SDS-PAGE were also electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with the same concatemerized oligonucleotide , probe Wt , used to screen the cDNA library .
The multi-meric probe binds the gel replica at exactly the position of the highly expressed 30-kD protein ( Fig .
3B , lane 4 ) .
No binding activity was detected in the control extracts ( lane 5 ) .
Concatemerized versions of a nonspecific control probe [ a 25-bp oligonucleotide which contains the binding site of an unrelated protein ) did not bind the 30-kD species .
A smaller bacterial protein bound the control probe , providing a useful internal control for bacterial protein concentration ( lanes 6 and 7 ) .
DNA binding of the ets-1 polypeptide was analyzed further in gel mobility-shift assays [ Fried and Crothers 1981 ) .
Cell extracts were prepared from ets-1-expressing cultures and control bacterial cultures , incubated with the Wt 25-bp oligonucleotide probe , and then electro- Proto-oncogene , ets-1 , binds MSV LTR promoter phoresed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels .
A unique nucleoprotein complex was resolved from extracts prepared from ets-1-expressing cells but not from control extracts ( Fig .
4 , lanes 2 and 8 ) .
A 400-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe Wt almost completely eliminated this binding activity ( Fig .
4 , lane 6 ) while inclusion of an equivalent amount of the nonspecific control probe had no effect on binding ( Fig .
4 , lane 7 ) .
These data demonstrate that the ets-dependent nucleoprotein complexes are specific for the oligomer probe Wt , which represents LTR sequences .
Specific nucleotide contacts of the ets-1 polypeptide were analyzed by methylation interference experiments performed on an 85-bp , LTR-derived restriction frag-ment .
Figure 5A shows the relative depletion and enrichment of specific methylation sites in the protein-bound and unbound DNA fractions .
Methylation of three guanine residues on the bottom strand of the binding site interfered with binding .
This finding of a precise set of DNA close contacts necessary for ets-1 DNA binding demonstrates that the ets-1 cDNA sequence encodes a polypeptide with sequence-specific DNA-binding activity , We also performed this analysis with the LTR-binding activity in calf thymus extracts ( Fig .
5B ) .
The identical contact points were mapped , suggesting that ets-related proteins are responsible for the LTR-binding activity in the thymus extract .
ets-1 binding site functions as a LTR transcriptional activator sequence The binding of the ets-1 polypeptide fragment to the MSV LTR promoter element suggests that ets-1 or related proteins that share its DNA-binding specificity may have a role in eukaryotic transcriptional control .
We decided to investigate this possibility further by testing the transcriptional efficiency of MSV LTR-driven templates bearing a mutant ets-1 binding site .
We synthesized a mutant binding site by changing four base pairs within the DNA contact zone ( Fig .
5C ) .
Before testing the effects of these mutations on LTR-mediated transcription , we compared the affinity of the ets-1 polypeptide for the wild-type and mutant sites in mobility-shift assays ( Fig .
6 ) .
Reactions in which higher amounts of extract were included showed a higher percentage of shifted probe in both the wild-type and mutant series .
The nucleoprotein complex formed on the wild-type probe ( Fig .
6A , lanes 2-5 ) had the same mobility as the specific complex analyzed by competition and methylation interference analysis ( Figs .
4 and 5 ) .
In contrast , reactions performed with the mutant probe displayed no nucleoprotein complexes with the mobility of the ets-1-dependent complex .
Instead , nonspecific complexes of slower mobility were observed [ Fig .
6A , lanes 7-10 ) .
Unlabeled oligomeric DNA of any sequence composition competed with this mutant probe binding activity ( data not shown ) .
The quantity of extract that shifted the minimally detectable amount of the wild-type probe ( Fig .
6A , lane 2 ) is 18-fold lower than the quantity that GENES & DEVELOPMENT 669 Gunther et al .

failed to cause a detectable shift of mutant probe into an ets-1 complex ( Fig .
6A , lane 10 } , indicating that the mutant site has a binding affinity that is at least 18-fold lower than the affinity of the wild-type site .
Additional evidence for the effectiveness of the site-directed mutagenesis in destroying the ets-1 binding site is shown in Figure 6B .
The mutant probe failed to compete with the wild-type site binding activity in experiments in which unlabeled mutant probe was added as a competitor .
In addition , the 30-kD bacterially expressed ets-1 , when transferred to nitrocellulose , exhibited no binding to a concatemerized mutant probe ( data not shown ) .
These experimental results demonstate that the site-directed mutagenesis of the ets-1 binding site effectively eliminated the ets-1 binding capability of the MSV LTR .
To test the transcriptional efficiency of the MSV LTR containing the mutant ets-1 binding site , transient expression assays were performed in mouse EL4 cells , a T-lymphocyte cell line .
Transcription templates were constructed by cloning wild-type and mutant versions of the MSV LTR upstream of the human growth hormone ( GH ) reporter gene ( Fig .
7A ) .
Two mutant constructions had either the enhancer ( pMSV-GH ; A5'-111 ) or the enhancer plus promoter sequences ( [ pMSV-GH , ; A5'-31 ) de-leted .
In the third mutant construction , the mutant ets-1 binding site was placed in pMSV-GH ; A5'-111 .
We chose to study the mutant binding site in this context because MSV enhancer elements have been shown to mask the effect of promoter mutations ( Graves , 1985b ; B. Graves , unpubl . }
.
An internal control was provided by a plasmid Proto-oncogene , ets-1 , binds MSV LTR promoter [ pMSV-CAT ) containing the chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene driven by a wild-type MSV LTR .
The experimental ( GH ) and control ( CAT ) plasmids were cotransfected into exponentially growing EL4 cells by electroporation .
Poly { A } -selected RNA from cells transfected with the pMSV-GH construction ( Fig.7A , line 1 ) was isolated 40 hr post-transfection and assayed by primer extension to determine the position of the cap site being used in the pMSV-GH transcription templates .
Figure 7B shows the extension product of the size expected if expression from the pMSV-GH used the native MSV cap site .
For quantitative comparisons of transcriptional efficiencies , the culture media were assayed for growth hormone levels and cellular proteins were assayed for CAT enzyme activity at 40 hr post-transfection .
The transcriptional efficiency of the pMSV-GH template bearing the mutant ets-1 binding site was at least 23-fold lower than the expression of the A5'-111 pMSV-GH template { Fig .
7A , lines 2 and 3 ) .
Within the sensitivity limits of this assay , the mutation of the ets-1 site was equally detrimental to GH expression as the deletion of all sequences between -111 and -31 ( Fig .
7A , line 4 ) .
Expression of the internal control reporter plasmid bearing the CAT gene showed a less than twofold variation between transfected cell popula-tions .
These data demonstrate that the ets-1 binding site in the MSV LTR functions as a positive transcriptional control element .

Basic amino acids in cellular genes of the ets-f group are indicated at top of figure .
The extent of conservation of these basic amino acid positions throughout the whole family is indicated at the bottom of the Figure .

temerized oligonucleotide probe used to screen the cDNA library .
These data demonstrate that the ets-1 ORF of the A clone encodes a DNA-binding activity .
However , two pieces of data suggest that this cDNA does not encode the entire mouse ets-1 polypeptide .
First , there is no initiator methionine in the amino-terminal portion of the ORF .
If initation occurred at the first AUG in the cDNA sequence , 198 bp that are highly conserved in both human and chicken ets-1 gene products would be untranslated .
Second , immunopreci-pitation studies indicate that the mouse ets-f-related polypeptides have molecular weights in the range of 63,000-70,000 ( Pognonec et al .
1988 ) , whereas the polypeptide encoded by the isolated Agtll clone is only 30 kD .
Minimally , the ets-1 cDNA clone used in these experiments is missing the amino-terminal half of the mouse ets-1 gene product .
It will be important to determine whether the full-length mouse ets-1 protein has the same DNA-binding properties as the polypeptide produced from the cDNA clone .
Nevertheless , the study of a fragment of the ets-1 protein indicates that the 271 carboxy-terminal amino acids of the mouse ets-1 protein are sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding .
The sequence of this region bears no resemblance to well-characterized DNA-binding domains [ zinc fingers or helix-turn-helix motifs ) .
However , the 271 amino acids do include the region of the ets-1 gene that is highly homologous among all members of the ets gene family .
Figure 8 shows the amino acid sequence of the highly conserved region of five ets family members , ets-1 ( mouse , chicken , human , and virus } , ets-2 ( mouse , chicken , human } , erg and elk-1 ( human } , and E74 ( Drosophila ) .
Several features of the primary predicted amino acid sequence in this conserved domain are striking and suggest that this domain might be involved in DNA binding .
A set of three tryptophans , as noted by Anton and Frampton ( 1988 ) , demonstrate spacing similar to the tryptophan repeats of the recently described myb motif ( Tice-Baldwin et al .
1989 ) .
Proteins bearing this repeat exhibit sequence-specific DNA 674 GENES & DEVELOPMENT binding activities ; however , a role for the tryptophans in DNA-binding activity of the proteins has not been de-termined .
A high density of basic amino acids is observed between amino acids 203 and 246 { 16 of 43 amino acids are lysine , histidine , or arginine ) .
Clusters of positively charged amino acids have been shown to be critical for the DNA binding by the leucine zipper/basic domain ( bZIP ) group of DNA-binding proteins ( Landschulz et al .
1989 ) .
( No obvious conservation of the bZIP motif is seen in the ets family . )
Additional experiments are in progress to delineate the DNA-binding domain of ets-1 and to determine whether the conserved domain of the ets family is sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding .
The DNA sequence specificity of ets-1 binding was confirmed by methylation interference experiments .
A set of close DNA contacts important to the stability of the ets-1 nucleoprotein complexes was identified .
The importance of these specific contacts was tested further by the construction of a mutant oligonucleotide probe in which the nucleotides involved in putative close contacts were altered .
In mobility-shift assays , the mutant probe showed no specific binding ; in competition exper-iments , the mutant site oligonucleotide failed to compete with the wild-type binding site probe .
We have not analyzed any additional ets-1 binding sites from which to derive a consensus binding sequence .
However , the ets-1 binding site is in a region of the MSV LTR that shows strong conservation in the LTRs of all type-C murine , feline , and simian retroviruses ( Golemis et al .
1990 ) .
The conserved sequences nearest the binding site include the CGCGCTTNNGC between positions -52 and -42 .
The NNGC nucleotides were altered in our site-directed mutagenesis .
Additional experiments are in progress to describe more completely the sequence requirements for ets-1 binding .
The transcriptional activity of an LTR promoter bearing a mutant binding site for ets-1 sheds new light on the biological function of the ets gene family .
In transient expression assays in EL4 cells , multiple mutations Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press in the ets-1 binding site strongly debilitated the promoter activity .
These data suggest that a protein with the DNA-binding activity of ets-1 functions as a transcriptional activator .
It is reasonable to propose that ets-1 is the EL4 cell protein that functions as an activator of the LTR-mediated expression , since RNA and protein products of the mammalian and chicken ets-1 genes have been reported to be expressed preferentially in lymphoid cells { ( Chen 1985 ; Ghysdael et al .
1986 ; Bhat et al .
1987 , 1989 ) , including mouse EL4 cells .
However , if the DNA-binding domain of ets-1 is encoded by the highly conserved region of the ets gene family { as hypothesized above ) , the data can not eliminate other ets family members as possible transcriptional activators in EL4 cells .
For example , ets-2 , which has a more general tissue distribution than ets-1 ( Bhat et al .
1987 } , also could be active in the EL4 transient expression assays .
The differential expression of ets-1 in the thymus and spleen of adult animals has led to attempts to determine a biological role for the proto-oncogene ets-1 in T-lymphocyte development and function .
Chicken and mouse ets-1 proteins become phosphorylated during Ca*+-in-duced T-cell activation ( Pognonec et al .
1988 ) , suggesting a role in T-lymphocyte function .
More recently , a role of mouse ets-1 in thymocyte development has been proposed based on the coordinate expression of ets-1 and CD4 in early thymocytes ( Bhat et al .
1989 ) .
The finding that an ets-1 polypeptide binds a promoter element in a sequence-specific manner suggests that the ets-1 gene product functions as a transcription factor during thymocyte development and/or mature T-lymphocyte function .
It has long been speculated that the ability of Moloney MLV to cause lymphomas is due to the successful replication of the virus in lymphoid tissue ( Jaenisch 1979 ; Chatis et al .
1983 ; Evans and Morrey 1987 ; Speck et al .
1990 } .
The ability of the retroviral LTR to exploit a lymphoid transcription factor would explain in part this suc-cess .
As described by Golemis and colleagues ( 1990 } , the regions of the MSV LTR bearing the ets-1 binding site is highly conserved in the LTRs of all murine , simian , and feline type-C retroviruses .
We speculate that ets-1 or other members of the ets proto-oncogene family function as transcription factors for all of these viruses during their replication in mammalian cells .
Chicken ets-1 is transduced by the avian leukosis virus E26 as part of the p135 transforming protein .
The p135 protein also contains a fragment of the chicken myb gene .
Since myb also binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner ( Biedenkapp et al .
1988 ; Ness et al .
1989 ) , the sequence-specific DNA-binding properties of the viral p135 must now be tested .
If the ets-1 and/or myb DNA-binding domain ( s ) are intact in the p135 oncogene , altered utilization of the native DNA-binding activities of these two cellular gene products could be responsible for p135-mediated transformation .
For example , a transcriptional activation domain on myb could regulate promoters bearing a ets-1 binding site ( or vice versa ) .
Finally , the discovery that ets-1 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein and that a cellular protein with Proto-oncogene , éts-1 , binds MSV LTR promoter this DNA-binding activity is a transcriptional activator has implications for the function of the entire ets family .
Two provocative features of the ets gene family have been reported previously .
First , there is differential tissue distribution of various ets-related proteins in human , chicken , and mouse .
For example , as noted above , ets-1 expression is highest in lymphoid lineages , whereas ets-2 has a more general tissue distribution ( Bhat et al .
1987 ) .
A recently described family member , elk-1 , is more abundant in lung and testis than in hema-topoietic lineages ( Rao et al .
1989 ) .
Second , as described above , there is strong conservation of a 97-amino-acid domain that has some resemblance to DNA-binding proteins .
We speculate that the ets family of proteins is a new class of transcriptional activators .
Furthermore , we propose that the members of the family share a conserved structural domain designed for DNA binding .
This phenomenon has been well described in the case of the Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins , which show different tissue distribution and regulation , yet share a common DNA-binding domain and bind an identical octa-meric DNA sequence ( Herr et al .
1988 ) .
The broader class of homeo domain proteins ( Scott et al .
1989 ] also illustrate this emerging feature of eukaryotic transcriptional regulators .
As in other groups of related DNA-binding proteins , an important question to be resolved for the ets family will be how differential utilization of a common DNA-binding structure is regulated .
Methods Binding site probes DNase I protection assays were performed on the 150-bp HindIII -Bglll restriction fragment of pMSV-tk ( A5'-111 ) ( Graves et al .
1985b ) , end-labeled on the top strand at the HindIII site or on the bottom strand at the BgIll site with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ y*P ] ATP .
An LTR subclone , peMSV { ( -74/-=31 ) , which contains the MSV LTR promoter sequences between positions -74 and -31 { with respect to the transcription start site ) was used in the ets-1 30-kD binding studies .
It was constructed from a 5'-deletion mutant of the MSV LTR , whose -74 end point bears a BamHI linker .
This plasmid was restricted with Sstl and treated with S1 nuclease to expose position -31 to the addition of a Bg !
ll linker .
The 50-bp BamHI-Bgilll restriction fragment was then ligated into the BamHI site of pEMBL 18 polylinker .
The 85-bp HindIII-EcoRI restriction fragment of peMSV ( -74/-31 ) was end-labeled at either the EcoRI polylinker site ( bottom strand ) or the HindIII site ( top strand ) with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ y-*P ] JATP .
Radiola-beled fragments were resolved by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , electrophoresed onto NA-45 paper , then eluted with 1 m NaCl .
Alternatively , 25-nucleotide complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed for binding studies .
The sequence of the synthetic oligomeric probe , termed Wt , which represents wild-type LTR sequences between position -53 and -34 is as follows : GATCTGCGCGCTTCCGCTCTCCGACG ACGCGCGAAGGCGACGAGGCTCCTAG The mutant ets-1 binding site probe , termed Mt , was also generated from two synthetic complementary oligonucleotides .
GENES & DEVELOPMENT 675 Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Gunther et al .
It has the identical sequence as the Wt probe except for four base pair substitutions { indicated in lower case ) : GATCTGCGCGCTTsgegTCTCCGAG ACGCGCCGAAcegcAGAGGCTCCTAG The nonspecific control probe , which contains a binding site for the mammalian transcription factor , C/EBP ( Vinson et al .
1988 ) , was also synthesized .
AATTGCCTGATTGCCCAATTGT CGGACTAACGGGTTAACATTAA End-labeling of all oligonucleotide probes with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ y-*P|JATP preceded annealing .
Concatemerized versions of oligomer probes were constructed by li-gating radiolabeled , annealed oligonucleotides with T4 DNA li-gase for 12 hr .
Gel electrophoresis of ligation products indicated that 10-20 copies of the repeat unit were present in each mul-timeric DNA molecule .
Thymus cDNA library construction Polyadenylated RNA was prepared from thymus glands of 4-week-old mice [ BALB/c ] .
A bacteriophage Agtll cDNA expression library was constructed following standard protocols ( Gubler and Hoffman 1983 ; Huynh et al .
1985 } , as detailed by Klickstein and Neve ( 1989 ) .
The following modifications were made : An equal molar mixture of poly ( dT ) and random hex-amer primers were used for first-strand cDNA synthesis .
Blunt-ended double-stranded cDNA was engineered for cloning into EcoR|-restricted and phosphatased Agt11 arms ( Promega ) by the addition of EcoRI adaptors : AATTCCCGGGATCC GGGCCCTACCG Recombinant phage were packaged in Gigapack Gold II extracts ( Stratagene ) .
The library contained 2.5 x 106 independent recombinants .
Screening of kgt11 plaques with DNA-binding site probes The thymus cDNA expression library was screened with the Wt oligomeric probe by the protocol of Vinson et al .
( 1988 ) except for the following alterations .
No guanidinium hydrochlo-ride denaturation was performed .
Recombinant phage { from the unamplified library } were plated at 3 x 10° pfu/150-mm plate for the primary screening .
Concatemerized oligonucleotide probes , labeled to a specific activity of 10° cpm/pug , were used at a concentration of 2-5 ng/ml of binding buffer .
All filter manipulations were performed at 4°C .
Agt11 clone subcloning and sequencing Two EcoRI restriction fragments ( 547 bp and 2.1 kbp ) of the ets-1 cDNA insert were cloned into the Bluescript pKS vector ( Stratagene ) and subjected to dideoxy sequencing using Se-quenase { US Biochemical .
Both strands of the 822 bp [ Fig .
2 ) were sequenced using either the M13 universal primer , the T3 primer , or synthetic primers designed to hybridize to internal sites in the EcoRI subclones .
Bacterial expression of ets-l ORF The pET-ets-1 plasmid contains 886 bp of mouse ets-1 sequence .
It was constructed by converting the AfllI site of the ets-1 cDNA at position +886 ( with respect to the cloning 676 GENES & DEVELOPMENT adapter ) to a BamHI site by addition of a synthetic linker sequence .
The BamHI site of the cDNA cloning adapter and BamHI linker site were then restricted to generate an 886-bp restriction fragment for insertion in the pET 3a vector [ Rosen-berg et al .
1987 } .
BL21 { ( DE3 ] pLysS cells ( Rosenberg et al .
1987 } containing either the control pET3 plasmid or the pET-ets-1 plasmid were grown at 37°C to an ODgy , of 0.5 units .
IPTG was then added to 1 mM and cells were incubated for an additional `` hr at 37°C .
Cells were harvested at 30008 for 5 min at 23°C , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mm Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 1 mm EDTA , 1 mm DTT , 1 mm PMSF } , quick-frozen , and thawed .
The lysate was incubated on ice for 15 min to allow lysis from endogenous lysozyme , then adjusted to 1 M NaCl .
Samples were incubated for 20 min on a rotator at 4°C , then centrifuged at 10,0008 for 30 min at 4°C .
The supernatant was dialyzed against binding buffer TGMEK [ 25 mm Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 10 % glycerol , 5 mm MgCl , , 0.1 mm EDTA ] containing 100 mm KCl and supplemented with 1 mm DTT , 1 mm PMSF .
The ets-dependent 30-kD polypeptide comprised 3-5 % of the protein mass in the extracted cell lysates .
DNA-binding assays Southwestern blot analysis was performed on total cell lysates of BL21 ( DE3 ] ) cells .
The pelleted cells were resuspended directly in PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE ( Laemmli 1970 } .
Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters ( Towbin et al .
1979 ) .
The filters were processed and probed using conditions identical to the bacteriophage plaque replica filters .
Mobility-shift assays for titrations , competitions and methylation interference were performed essentially as described by Fried and Crothers { 1981 ) and modified by Nye and Graves ( 1990 ) .
In a total volume of 20 pl , 0.05 ng of P-labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with 0.3-6 ug of bacterial extract , 1 ul poly [ d { I-C ) ] , and 0.25 ng of a nonspecific 25-bp oligonucleotide in binding buffer at 50 mm KCl After 20 min at 4°C , the samples were electrophoresed in 5 % ( 30 : 0.8 ) polyacrylamide gels using a 45 mm Tris-borate { pH 8.3 ) buffer .
Methylation interference reactions were performed as described by Siebenlist and Gilbert ( 1980 ) and modified by Nye and Graves ( 1990 ) .
DNase I footprint assays were performed as previously described ( Graves et al .
1986 ) .
In a total volume of 50 pl , P-end-labeled DNA { ~1.5 ng ) was incubated with 1 mg of calf thymus nucleus extract { fractionated as described below ] and 100 ng of poly [ d { I-C ) ] in binding buffer .
pMSV-GH constructs and ets- binding site mutagenesis The pMSV-GH plasmids were constructed by cloning the LTR-bearing , HindIII-Bg !
HI restriction fragments of wild-type , A5'-111 , and A5'-31 MSV -tk plasmids [ Graves et al .
1985b ) upstream of the human growth hormone gene in pOGH ( Nichols Institute ) .
At the 3 terminus of LTR sequences in these con-structs , position +30 , a synthetic Bglll linker is fused to the BamHI site of pOGH .
The LTR bearing a disrupted ets-1 binding site was constructed by synthesizing complementary oligonucleotides containing LTR sequences between a native BssHI site at position -52 and a native Sstl site at position -32 , except for the four base substitutions between positions -42 and -45 .
This synthetic DNA was ligated into an MSV LTR-bearing plasmid that had been restricted at the unique Sstl site and partially restricted with BssHI to generate a BssHI cloning site at -52 .
Bacteria were transformed and the resulting colonies were screened by hybridization to the mutant oligonucleotide .
The presence of the mutated sequence and the Downloaded from genesdev.cshlp.org on May 10 , 2019 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press absence of other changes in the LTR promoter region were confirmed by sequencing .
Transient expression assays EL4 cells ( kindly provided by N. Speck ) were maintained in suspension culture in Dulbecco 's modified minimal essential me-dium , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
A total of 6.5 x 106 EL4 cells from logarithmically growing cultures were collected by centrifugation , washed once with calcium- and magnesium-free Tris-buffered saline , and resuspended in 0.65 ml of HEPES-buffered saline ( Wigler et al .
1977 ) adjusted to 0.19 mM dithiothreitol .
Plasmid DNA { 40 ug of pMSV-GH and 5 ug of pMSV-CAT ) was then added .
The electroporator [ Hoeffer ) was charged at 190 volts and 490 F and subsequently discharged across the cell suspension .
Immediately after electro-poration , a quarter of the cell suspension was diluted into 4 ml of growth medium and placed directly in a growth chamber .
Human growth hormone concentration of the media was determined at 40 hr post-transfection using a radioimmune assay and standard growth hormone solutions [ Selden et al .
1986 ) according to manufacturer 's specifications ( Nichols Institute ] .
CAT assays were performed as described by Clevers et al .
( 1988 ) .
Primer extension assays were performed as previously described ( Graves et al .
1985b ) .
The GH primer , a 22-nucleotide synthetic oligonucleotide , is complementary to the coding strand of the most promoter-proximal growth hormone sequences in the pMSV-GH constructs .
The extension products include the sequences of a Bg/lI linker ( 7 nucleotides ) and the LTR between position +30 and the cap site .
The 25-nucleotide MLV primer ( Graves et al .
1985a ) ] , which detects expression from endogeneous MLV proviruses , served as an internal control for RNA recovery .
Calf thymus extracts Thymus glands from newly slaughtered calves ( 12-18 months ) were defatted , cut into chunks , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at -80°C .
Nuclei were isolated in buffers similar to those described for the isolation of at liver nuclei ( Gorski et al .
1986 ; Graves et al .
1986 } .
Frozen thymus glands were thawed for 5 min in buffer A [ 0.25 m sucrose , 15 mm Tris-Cl ( pH 7.9 } , 120 mm KCl , 15 mm NaCl , 2 mm EDTA ] and pieces were then mixed with cold buffer B [ 2 m sucrose , 10 mm Tris-Cl ( pH 7.9 } , 25 mm KCl , 1 mm EDTA , 0.15 mm spermine , 0.5 mm spermidine , 10 % glycerol ] at a ratio of 2 ml/gram of tissue .
The mixture was homogenized for 20 sec at high speed in an Oster commercial blender .
Homogenates were sieved three times through two layers of cheesecloth and the filtrate was then centrifuged at 2500g for 30 min at 4°C .
The supernatant was removed by aspiration and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer C [ 10 mm Tris-Cl ( pH 7.9 ) , 100 mm KCI , 2 mm MgCl , , 0.1 mm EDTA , 0.15 mm spermine , 0.5 mm spermidine , 10 % glycerol| to a concentration of approximately 3.5 x 10° nuclei/ml of buffer { estimate 2.5 x 108 nuclei per gram thymus tissue ) .
Buffers B and C contained the following protease inhibitors : 1 mm DTT , 2.5 mm benzamidine , 0.5 mm PMSF , 1 pg/ml leupeptin , l g/ml pepstatin .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from isolated thymic nuclei as previously described for preparation of rat liver nuclear extracts ( Graves et al .
1986 ) .
The final ammonium sulfate precipitate was redissolved in TGMEK ; , , ( supplemented with 1 mm DTT , 0.5 mm PMSF , 2.5 mm benzamidine ) to a protein concentration of approximately 8 mg/ml , dialysed in TGMEE o , , and centrifuged at 100008 for 10 min at 4°C .
The extract was fractionated by two chromatography steps conducted in TGMEK .
Nuclear extracts were loaded onto a Proto-oncogene , ets-1 , binds MSV LTR promoter 40-ml heparin agarose ( Bethesda Research Laboratories ) column equilibrated with TGMEK q , and bound protein was eluted by buffer salt steps of 300 mm and 500 mm KCl .
The 500 mm KCl fraction contained LTR binding activity as assayed by DNasel protection experiments .
After dialysis to 100 mm KCI , the active fraction was loaded onto a 5-ml double-stranded DNA Sepharose column ( Graves et al .
1986 ) .
The bound fraction was eluted with a 500 mm KCl and used , undialysed , in the DNA-binding assays .
