( 1992 ) 282 , 625-629 ( Printed in Great Britain ) RESEARCH COMMUNICATION 625 Leukotriene B , stimulates c-fos and c-jun gene transcription and AP-1 binding activity in human monocytes Jana STANKOVA and Marek ROLA-PLESZCZYNSKI Immunology Division , Department of Pediatrics , Faculty of Medicine , University of Sherbrooke , 3001 12th Avenue North , Sherbrooke , Québec , Canada J1H SN4 We have examined the effect of leukotriene B , ( LT B , ) , a potent lipid proinflammatory mediator , on the expression of the proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos .
In addition , we looked at the modulation of nuclear factors binding specifically to the AP-1 element after LTB , stimulation .
LTB , increased the expression of the c-fos gene in a time- and concentration-dependent manner .
The c-jun mRNA , which is constitutively expressed in human peripheral-blood monocytes at relatively high levels , was also slightly augmented by LTB , , although to a much lower extent than c-fos .
The kinetics of expression of the two genes were also slightly different , with c-fos mRNA reaching a peak at 15 min after stimulation and c-jun at 30 min .
Both messages rapidly declined thereafter .
Stability of the c-fos and c-jun mRNA was not affected by LTB , , as assessed after actinomycin D treatment .
Nuclear transcription studies in vitro showed that LTB , increased the transcription of the c-fos gene 7-fold and the c-jun gene 1.4-fold .
Resting monocytes contained nuclear factors binding to _ the AP-1 element , but stimulation of monocytes with LTB , induced greater AP-1-binding activity of nuclear proteins .
These results indicate that LTB , may regulate the production of different cytokines by modulating the yield and/or the function of transcription factors such as AP-1-binding proto-oncogene products .
INTRODUCTION Leukotriene B , ( LTB , ) is a potent biologically active lipid mediator which exerts numerous proinflammatory and immuno-regulatory activities [ 1-6 ] .
Its production by polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leucocytes can be triggered by a variety of stimuli ( reviewed in [ 2 ] ) , and the cells which produce it can also be targets of its bioactions .
In monocytes , exogenous LTB , was shown to stimulate H , O , production as well as cytotoxicity against tumour cells [ 7,8 ] .
Moreover , LTB , could stimulate the production of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor a [ 8 ] and interleukin 6 [ 9 ] .
Endogenous 5-lipoxygenase metabolites , including LTB , , may also be involved in mediating signals for cytokine production stimulated by other ligands , such as platelet-activating factor [ 10 ] .
The activation of several cytokine genes , including those of tumour necrosis factor a and interleukin-6 , can be mediated by nuclear protein trans-acting factors which bind to cis-acting DNA elements of gene promoters , such as AP-1 [ 11-13 ] .
AP-1-binding factors include the heterodimeric complex of FOS and JUN proteins [ 14 ] .
These proteins are products of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun respectively , which become trans-criptionally active within minutes after extracellular signals and regulate the expression of genes containing AP-l-binding sites { 15-18 ] .
Thus extracellular signals and their receptors can be linked to eventual cytokine production by a cascade of events which may include transcriptional activation of c-fos and c-jun , production of FOS-JUN proteins and binding to AP-l-con-taining cytokine genes , which would then trigger transcriptional activation of these genes and stimulation of production of the cytokines .
In the present study we demonstrate that the lipid mediator LTB , can indeed stimulate the transcriptional activation of c-fos and c-jun and we suggest that this may constitute a mechanism through which it can affect transcriptional regulation of AP-1-containing target genes .

Preparation of monocytes Human venous blood from healthy medication-free volunteers was collected on citrate/dextrose/adenine .
Undiluted blood was layered over a Ficoll-Paque ( Pharmacia , Baie d'Urfe , QC , Canada ) cushion and centrifuged at 800g for 30 min by the method of Boyum [ 19 ] .
Monocytes were then purified by adherence to the surface of plastic Petri dishes previously coated with baby-hamster-kidney-cell micro-exudate .
This was effective in enriching the adherent population to > 90 % monocytes as assessed by non-specific esterase staining .
This population was removed with EDTA ( 0.01 M ) in RPMI 1640 medium and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium/5 % fetal-bovine serum ( Flow , McLean , VA , U.S.A. ) .
The cells were then 'rested ' overnight in polypropylene tubes ( 15 ml ; Becton-Dickinson Labware , Lincoln Park , NJ , U.S.A. ) .
Since LTB , was dissolved in methanol before dilution in culture medium , control cultures contained methanol in equivalent maximal concentration , which never exceeded 0.01 % ( v/v ) and had no effect in the assays used in this study .

Effect of LTB , on c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression in human monocytes Northern-blot analysis was performed on 10 ug of total RNA .
( a ) Monocytes were stimulated for 30 min with ( 1 ) 0.003 % ( v/v ) methanol ( vehicle for LTB , ) , ( 2 ) 10~ `` m-LTB , , ( 3 ) 10~ `` m-LTB , , ( 4 ) 10~® m-LTB , and ( 5 ) 10~® m-LTB , .
( 6 ) Monocytes were stimulated with vehicle ( lanes 1 , 3 and 5 ) or LTB , at 10~® m ( lanes 2 , 4 and 6 ) for different time periods ( lanes 1 and 2 for 15 min , lanes 3 and 4 for 30 min and lanes 5 and 6 for 60 min ) .
( c ) Monocytes were used directly after overnight incubation ( lane 1 ) or incubated for 30 min without ( lane 2 ) or with ( lane 3 ) LTB , at 10~® m. In ( b ) and ( c ) the membranes were hybridized with c-fos , then stripped of the probe and rehybridized with c-jun-specific probe .
The membranes were exposed for 20 h at -80 °C .
mRNA studies After appropriate treatment , cells were pelleted in 15 ml polypropylene tubes ( Sarstedt , St.-Laurent , QC , Canada ) and total cellular RNA was isolated by acid guanidium thiocyanate/ phenol/chloroform extraction as described by Chomczynski & Sacchi [ 20 ] .
RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1 % agarose and transferred on to a Hybond-N ( Amersham , Oakville , Ont .
, Canada ) membrane for Northern analysis .
The cDNA probes used were a 2.7 kb Xhol/Stu insert of c-fos [ American Type Culture Collection ( A.T.C.C . )
] and a 0.9 kb Pst insert of c-jun ( generously provided by Dr. C. Asselin of this University ) .
The probes were labelled with multiprime DNA-labelling system ( Amersham International ) , using [ « -*°P ] dCTP ( specific radioactivity > 3000 Ci/mmol ; Amersham ) .
Membranes were prehybridized for 4 h in a mixture containing Tris ( 120 mm ) , NaCl ( 600 mm ) , EDTA ( 8 mm ) , sodium pyro-phosphate ( 0.1 % ) , SDS ( 0.2 % ) and heparin ( 100 ug/ml ) ; hybrid-ization was carried out overnight at 68 °C in the same mixture , but the concentration of heparin was increased to 625 g/ml and dextran sulphate ( 10 % ) was added [ 21 ] .
The membranes were then washed once at room temperature for 20 min in 2x SSC ( 1 x SSC is 0.15 m-NaC1/0.015 m-sodium citrate , pH 7 ) , once with 0.1 x SSC/0.1 % SDS at 68 °C for 60 min , then rinsed at room temperature with 0.1 x SSC .
The membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with intensifying screens at -80 °C .
Signal intensity was quantified by densitometry with a Phar-macia LKB Ultrascan XL instrument ( Pharmacia , Baie d'Urfe , Canada ) .
The membranes were then stripped of the probe by washing for 60 min with 0.02 x SSC/0.2 % SDS at 90 °C and rehybridized .
In order to assess stability of c-fos and c-jun mRNA , cells were treated with actinomycin D ( 10 ug/ml ) 10 min after stimulation with LTB , or medium to arrest transcription ; the reaction was stopped after various intervals , and Northern analysis was performed as described above .
Nuclear transcription in vitro The 'in vitro ' nuclear transcription assays were performed as described by Greenberg & Bender [ 22 ] with several modifications .
Briefly , nuclei were prepared from human monocytes by resus-pending cells in a lysis buffer containing sucrose ( 0.3 M ) , KCl ( 60 mm ) , NaCl ( 15 mm ) , Hepes ( pH 7.5 , 15 mm ) , EDTA ( 2 mm ) , EGTA ( 0.5 mm ) , spermine ( 0.15 mm ) , spermidine ( 0.5 mm ) , mer-captocethanol ( 14 mm ) and 0.1 % Nonidet P40 , followed by sedimentation through a 30 % ( w/v ) sucrose solution .
Transcription in vitro was carried out in the following transcription mixture : 1x buffer [ 5x buffer is ( NH , ) , SO , ( 1.5 ) /Tris/HCl ( pH 7.9 , 500 mm ) /MgC1 , ( 20 mm ) /MnCl , ( 20 mm ) /NaCl ( 1 ) / EDTA ( 2 mm ) /phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride ( 0.5 mm ] , di-thiothreitol ( 1.2 4M ) , GTP ( 1 mm ) , ATP ( 1 mm ) , CTP ( 1 mm ) , creatine phosphate ( 10 mm ) , RNasin ( 20 units/ml ) and glycerol ( 29 % , v/v ) in the presence of 150 4Ci of [ x- `` PJUTP ( > 3000 Ci/mmol ) .
The radiolabelled RNA was isolated by chloro-form/phenol extraction and trichloroacetic acid/sodium pyro-phosphate precipitation .
The labelled nuclear RNA was then hybridized to linearized cDNA probes ( 250 ng ) that were immobilized on Genescreen Plus membranes with a slot-blot apparatus .
The membranes were prehybridized with the following mixture : Hepes ( pH 7.5 , 50 mm ) /NaCl ( 0.75 m ) /formamide ( 50 % , v/v ) SDS ( 0.5 % ) /EDTA ( 2 mm ) /10 x Denhardt 's solution/salmon sperm DNA ( 500 ug/ml ) /poly ( A ) ( 10 ug/ml ) , for 2 days .
Hybrid ~ ization was carried out for 4 days in the same mixture with the radiolabelled RNA ; the membranes were then washed and exposed to X-ray film for 2 weeks .
Nuclear factors and mobility-shift assay Nuclei were isolated from monocytes and HeLa cells ( kindly given by Dr. D. Hunting ) as described above .
To obtain nuclear proteins , the nuclei were lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles ( minimum three ) , in a buffer containing 250 mm-Tris ( pH 7.8 ) , 60 mm-KCl , 1 mm-dithiothreito !
and 1 mm-phenylmethanesul-phonyl fluoride .
The following oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 binding site was used : with the complementary oligonucleotide STGACTCACTGA-CTCAC3 ' .
A mutant AAP-1 , SGTGATTCATTGATTCAY , annealed to its complementary strand , STGAATCAATGA-ATCAC3 ' , and an irrelevant oligonucleotide SP-1 , 5GGG-CGGGGGCGG3 ' , annealed to its complementary strand , 5CCGCCCCCGCCC3 ' , were used for competion studies .
For the binding reaction , the *°P-labelled probe ( 1-2 ng ) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 5 4g of the nuclear extract in binding buffer consisting of 10 mm-Hepes , pH 7.9 , 1992 Research Communication 60 mm-KCl , 4 % Ficoll , 1 mm-dithiothreitol , 1 mm-EDTA and 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) .
The DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a low-ionic-strength 4 % ( w/v ) -poly-acrylamide gel with Tris/borate electrophoresis buffer ( TBE ) .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun have been implicated in the regulation of both cell proliferation and differentiation .
These genes code for proteins which can associate in a hetero-dimer and function synergistically in DNA binding [ 23 ] .
We examined the effect of LTB , on the expression of the two proto-oncogenes in human monocytes .
Since adherence activates monocytes , they were incubated overnight , after their isolation , in order to allow them to return to their baseline activity .
Resting monocytes expressed low amounts of c-fos mRNA and substantially higher amounts of c-jun message ( Fig .
1c , lane 1 ) and these baseline levels varied between individuals , as has been shown by others [ 24 ] .
LTB , augmented the expression of c-fos mRNA in a dose-dependent manner , showing 3-1 5-fold increase at 10~* m and 2-S5-fold at 107° m ( Fig .
1a ) ; lower concentrations of LTB , did not consistently modulate c-fos expression .
The c-jun mRNA also showed increased accumulation after stimulation by LTB , at the same concentrations .
Although the expression of this gene was augmented to a much lower extent ( 1.2-1.5-fold ) , the increase was consistently reproducible ( Figs .
16 and 1c ) .

Effect of w-oxidation metabolites of LTB , on c-fos mRNA expression Total RNA ( 10 ug ) was isolated from monocytes taken directly after overnight incubation ( lane 1 ) or stimulated for 30 min with 3x 10~ ' % ( v/v ) methanol ( vehicle for LTB , ) ( lane 2 ) , 10~® m-LTB , ( lane 3 ) , 0.003 % ( v/v ) acetone ( vehicle for w-oxidation metabolites } ( lane 4 ) , 10~® m-20-OH-LTB , ( lane 5 ) or 10~® m-20-COOH-LTB , ( lane 6 ) .
The RNA was hybridized with c-fos-specific probe and exposed for 20 h at -80 °C .
Vol .
282 627 be augmented by simple physical perturbation , such as shaking the cells in order to distribute the intended stimulus .
This can be seen in Fig .
1 ( c ) and Fig .
2 ( lanes 1 ) where cells that have been rested overnight and directly harvested without further disturbance expressed much lower levels of mRNA than cells which had been shaken and incubated for a period of time ( lanes 2 ) .
The increase in c-fos mRNA accumulation was transient and reached a peak at about 15 min and was often undetectable after 1 h ; c-jun reached a peak at about 30 min and the mRNA still persisted at 2 h ( Fig .
16 and results not shown ) .
The time of appearance and length of persistence of mRNA for these two genes can vary with cell type and stimulus [ 25-27 ] .
Interestingly , LTB , failed to elicit either c-fos or c-jun expression in adipogenic TAl cells [ 28 ] and in peripheral-blood lymphocytes ( J. Stafikova , unpublished work ) .
Distinct signals elicit different kinetics of proto-oncogene activation in monocytes ; for example , macro-phage colony-stimulating factor augments c-jun mRNA within 30 min , but the expression returns to baseline within 60 min , whereas in alveolar macrophages c-fos reaches a peak at 60 min after macrophage-colony-stimulating-factor stimulation [ 29 ] .
Conversely , tumour necrosis factor a induced a prolonged expression of c-jun for up to 8 h , but c-fos expression is transient , returning to baseline within 60 min [ 27,30,31 ] , illustrating that diverse signalling pathways may result in potentially differential effects of the oncogene products .
Human neutrophils can rapidly metabolize LTB , by w-oxid-ation , leading to the formation of 20-OH-LTB , and 20-COOH-LTB , [ 32 ] .
These metabolites had only 20-30 % and 0-3 % activity respectively on c-fos expression , compared with LTB , ( Fig .
2 ) , suggesting that the integrity of the LTB , molecule was necessary for optimal activity .
A comparable level of activity for these metabolites has been found in other systems [ 33,34 ] .
Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of c-fos expression in human monocytes has been described .
For example , phorbol-ester-stimulated c-fos mRNA increase is related solely to increased transcription , whereas cycloheximide-induced increase results from both increased transcription of the c-fos gene and prolongation of the half-life of c-fos mRNA [ 35 ] .
We investigated whether stabilization of the c-fos message contributed to the mRNA accumulation observed in LTB , -stimulated > monocytes .
We measured the stability of c-fos mRNA by treating cells with LTB , for 10 min and then adding actinomycin D to block the RNA transcription de novo .
Although the c-fos mRNA half-life can be extended in monocytes by fMet-Leu-Phe , a chemotactic peptide [ 24 ] , the chemotactic lipid LTB , failed to stabilize the message for c-fos ( Fig .
3 ) .
Similarly , the half-life of c-jun mRNA was not affected by LTB , stimulation ( results not shown ) .
Since LTB , did not stabilize the proto-oncogene mRNA , we performed 'in vitro ' nuclear transcription ( run-on ) assays in order to determine whether transcriptional mechanisms were involved in the regulation of c-fos and c-jun expression by LT B , .
Both c-jun and c-fos genes were actively transcribed in unstimulated monocytes ( Fig .
4a ; NS ) , which is in agreement with previous reports [ 24,30 ] .
Stimulation with LTB , ( 10 nm ) increased the rate of transcription of the c-fos gene by a factor of 7 and the c-jun gene by a factor of 1.8 ( mean for six separate experiments ) ( Figs .
4a and 46 ) .
Some stimuli , such as forskolin , may enhance gene expression without producing an increase in nuclear AP-1 DNA binding , whereas the cytokine interleukin-1 induces both [ 36 ] .
We therefore investigated whether the augmented expression of c-fos and c-jun in LTB , -stimulated monocytes was associated with increased DNA-binding activity .
DNA-nuclear-protein interactions were monitored with a standard electrophoretic mobility-shift assay .
Unstimulated monocytes contained active factors 628 Level of c-fos mRNA ( % of that at zero time ) -- r = -- -- r -- -- -- - L 0 20 40 60 80 Time ( min } Fig .

Analysis of c-fos mRNA stability in monocytes treated with LTB , Monocytes were treated with vehicle ( methanol ; 3 x ( v/v ) ; control , @ ) or m-LTB , for 10 min ( ( ] ) and the levels of c-fos mRNA were determined before ( zero time ) and at 10 min intervals after actinomycin D ( 10 ug/ml ) was added .
Densitometric analysis of the levels of c-fos mRNA after actinomycin D treatment are expressed as percentages of the level in monocytes at zero time .

Analysis of c-jun and c-fos gene transcription in human monocytes stimulated with 107° m-LTB , Monocytes were incubated without ( NS or control ) or with 10~® m-LTB , for 30 min .
Nuclei were isolated and newly elongated *°P-labelled RNA transcripts were hybridized to immobilized c-fos and c-jun cDNA .

that bound to the AP-1 binding site ( Fig .
5a , lane 1 ) , but the binding activity was increased after stimulation with LTB , at concentrations of 1 4m and 10 nm , but not 10 fm ( lanes 2-4 ) .
The specificity of the reaction was supported by the fact that the unlabelled oligonucleotide readily competed with the labelled oligonucleotide for the formation of the labelled DNA-protein complex ( Fig .
5a , lanes 5-6 ) .
The second band in lanes 1-4 did not bind with specificity , as when it was present it could be competed for by unlabelled SP-1 oligonucleotide .
The specificity of AP-1 binding by nuclear extracts was further addressed by comparing the degree of mobility of nuclear-protein extracts from monocytes and HeLa cells .
As shown in Fig .

LTB , -induced AP-1 binding activity ( a ) Effect of LTB , on the activity of nuclear factors that bind to the AP-1 element .
Nuclear extracts from control ( lane 1 ) or LTB , -stimulated monocytes ( lane 2 , 107° m ; lane 3 , 10~® m ; lane 4 , 10~ `` M ) were incubated with **P-end-labelled double-stranded AP-1 oligonucleotide .
In lanes 5-7 the nuclear extracts and labelled oligonucleotide were incubated in the presence of 200-fold excess of unlabelled oligonucleotide ( lane 5 , control ; lane 6 , 107° m-LTB , ; lane 7 , 10~'* M-LTB , ) .
( 6 ) Nuclear protein-AP-1 complexes isolated from monocytes and HeLa cells migrate with a similar degree of retardation of mobility : M , monocyte extracts ; H , extract from HeLa cells .
( c ) Nuclear-protein extracts were incubated with the labelled AP-1 oligonucleotide in the absence ( lane 1 ) or presence ( lanes 2-5 ) of competing unlabelled double-stranded oligonucleo-tides .
Lane 1 , no competitor ; lane 2 , 50-fold excess of AAP-1 ; lane 3 , 50-fold excess of SP-1 ; lane 4 , 100-fold excess of AAP-1 ; lane 5 , 100-fold excess of SP-1 .
Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free oligonucleotide ( lower part of each lane ) in low-ionic-strength 4 % - ( w/v ) -polyacrylamide gels .
complexes show similar degree of retardation .
In addition , mutant AP-1 oligonucleotide did not compete with AP-1 at 50-100-fold excess concentrations ( Fig .
5¢ , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
An oligonucleotide containing the SP-1 binding site also did not decrease AP-1 binding ( Fig .
Sc , lanes 3 and 5 ) .
These data suggest that DNA-binding activity in monocytes stimulated with LTB , is specific for AP-1 .
It is not surprising that unstimulated monocytes exhibited AP-1-binding activity , since the expression of c-jun is constitutively high and JUN/JUN homodimers bind to the consensus AP-1 sequence , although less efficiently than FOS/JUN heterodimers [ 34,37 ] .
The increase in AP-1 binding of nuclear extracts from LTB , monocytes could be the result of greater FOS participation , due to increased gene expression .
We have shown that LTB , augments the expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun .
Since the protein products of these genes are factors which may regulate the transcription of 1992 Research Communication other genes , these data give the first indication that LTB , may modulate monocyte function , such as cytokine gene expression , by influencing the production or composition of transcriptional factors .
