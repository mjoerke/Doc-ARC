RAPID COMMUNICATION Interleukin-5 Signaling in Human Eosinophils Involves JAK2 Tyrosine Kinase and Statla By Tiomme van der Bruggen , Eric Caldenhoven , Deon Kanters , Paul Coffer , Jan A.M. Raaijmakers , Jan-Willem J. Lammers , and Leo Koenderman Signaling by a wide variety of cytokines , including interferons , interleukins , and growth factors , involves activation of JAK kinases and Stat ( Signal transducers and activators of transcription } proteins .
At present , not much is known about the molecular mechanisms by which interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) exerts its diverse biologic effects .
Human eosinophils are one of the most important target cells for IL-5 and were used here to study IL-5 signaling in a primary human cell .
IL-5 induced rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 .
Moreover , IL-5 induced at least two DNA-binding complexes , using nuclear extracts from normal human eosinophils and the IL-6/interferon-y response element of the ICAM-1 promotor { ICAM-1 pIRE ) in an electromobility shift UMAN EOSINOPHILS play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as allergic asthma . '
From in vitro experiments it has been established that eosinophil functioning , as well as expression of cell surface proteins , can be induced or increased by several cytokines such as interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-8 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) , or interferon-y ( IFN-y ) .
> * IL-5 is of special interest , because it is the terminal differentiation factor for eosinophils . ``
Several lines of evidence suggest that eosinophil functions are also modulated in vivo .
For instance , the phenotype of eosinophils isolated from the peripheral blood of allergic asthmatic subjects resembles the IL-5-primed ( preactivated ) phenotype in a chemotaxis assay .
'* `` ' Eosinophils obtained from a bron-choalveolar lavage ( BAL ) from allergen-challenged allergic asthmatics have a changed expression of multiple adhesion molecules , indicating an activated phenotype . ``
IL-5 is a rather selective cytokine , because the IL-5 receptor is expressed on a limited number of hemopoietic cells , ie , eosinophils , basophils , and some B cells . ``
High-affinity receptors for IL-5 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF are composed of a unique -subunit and a common # -subunit .
'* `` The 3-subunit is important for cytokine signaling and these cytokines , as one might expect , have similar effects on eosinophils . ``

From supershift experiments it was concluded that one DNA-binding complex contained Statia « , probably as a homodimer .
Both DNA-binding complexes were inhibited by a phosphotyrosine antibody ( 4G10 ) , suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for complex formation .
IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in-duced , similar to IL-5 , two DNA-binding complexes in human eosinophils , including Statie .
These data show for the first time that molecular mechanisms of IL-5 signaling in human eosinophils involve members of the JAK kinase family as well as members of the Stat family .

Tested on a variety of cells , IL-5 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF have several effects , such as tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular substrates , including the 3-subunit of the IL-5/IL-3/ GM-CSF receptors and Shc , and activation of p21 ras and MAP kinase .
*'* `` Some tyrosine kinases have been identified that are activated by IL-3 and GM-CSF , eg , the proto-oncogene product c-fps/fes and lyn kinase . ``
JAK2 , a member of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases ( JAK kinases ) , is also activated by IL-3 and GM-CSF .
`` ** `` JAK kinases play a central role in signaling by several cytokines , including interferons , interleukins , and growth factors . ``
'' The JAK kinase family comprises at least four members , ie , JAK1 , JAK2 , JAK3 , and TYK2 . ``
'' Activation of JAK kinases is important for the subsequent activation of members of the Stat ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) family , a rapidly expanding family comprising Statla « , Stat18 , Stat2 , Stat3 , Stat4 , and mammary gland fac-tor .
`` * > `` IFN-a-induced activation of the interferon-stimu-lated gene factor-3 complex ( composed of Statie , Stat1B , Stat2 , and p48 ) requires JAK 1 and TYK2 , whereas activation of Statlae by IFN-y is dependent on JAK1 and JAK2 . ``
In this study , we have investigated whether members of the JAK kinase family are involved in IL-5 signaling .
Fur-thermore , it was tested if IL-5 could induce DNA-binding complexes , containing proteins that possibly share homology with members of the Stat family .
We found that JAK2 was phosphorylated on tyrosine upon IL-5 treatment of eosinophils .
Using the IL-6/IFN-y response element of the ICAM-1 promotor ( ICAM-1 pIRE ) , `` we found that IL-5 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF induced at least two DNA-binding complexes .
One of these DNA-binding complexes contained Stati .

IL-5 SIGNALING IN HUMAN EOSINOPHILS cacege-3 ' ) .
All other materials were reagent grade .
Cell incubations were performed in HEPES buffer , containing 132 mmol/L NaCl , 6.0 mmol/L KCI , 1.0 mmol/L CaCl ; 1.0 mmol/L MgSO , 1.2 mmol/ L potassium phosphate , 20 mmol/L HEPES , 5 mmol/L glucose , and 0.5 % human serum albumin ( HSA ; wt/vol ) , pH 7.4 .
Antibodies .
- Antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ; mouse IgG2bx , hybridoma 4G10 ) , anti-JAK2 , and anti-TYK2 polyclonal rabbit antiserum were obtained from UBI ( Lake Placid , NY ) .
MoAb ( mouse IgG1 ) directed against Stat91/84 ( Statla/ $ ) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories ( Lexington , KY ) .
Anti-Stat91 ( Statla ) polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the 36 COOH-terminal amino acids unique to Statla was a kind gift of Dr C. Schindler ( Columbia University , NY ) .
Isolation of human eosinophils .
- Blood from healthy volunteers was kindly provided by the Bloodbank of Utrecht , The Netherlands .
Mixed granulocytes were isolated from the buffy coat of 500 mL blood anticoagulated with 0.4 % trisodium citrate ( pH 7.4 ) as described before . ``
The granulocyte fraction was centrifuged for 20 minutes at room temperature over Percoll ( density , 1.084 g/mL ; layered on percoll with a density of 1.1 g/mL ) to reduce the number of neutrophils .
The eosinophil enriched fraction was collected from the percoll 1.084/1.1 interface .
Eosinophils were subsequently isolated by the method essentially as described by Hansel et al . ``
'' This isolation procedure makes use of the fact that , in marked contrast to neutrophils , eosinophils lack the epitope on FoyR HP® recognized by the MoAb CLB-FcR-gran 1 . ``
As a result , highly purified eosinophils can be isolated by removing neutrophils coated with FcR-gran-1 with immunomagnetic beads .
In short , neutrophils were coated with a CD16 MoAb ( CLB FcR-gran 1 ; 2 ug/10 ' cells/mL ) for 20 minutes at 4°C .
Hereafter , the cells were washed twice and subsequently coincubated head over head with dynabeads coated with sheep antimouse antibodies at a ratio of 1:2 ( cells : beads ) for 20 minutes at 4°C .
Neutrophils were subsequently removed by a magnetic particle concentrator Dynal ) .
Eosinophil purity was always greater than 95 % , with a viability of more than 98 % as judged by trypan blue exclusion .
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting .
- After incubation with IL-5 , eosinophils were incubated with lysis buffer ( 3 % NP40 , 20 mmol/L Tris/HCl , 100 mmol/L NaCl , 10 mmol/L Na , P ; ,0 ; , 2 mmol/L EDTA , 50 mmol/L NaF , 10 pg/mL aprotinin and leupeptin , 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride [ PMSF ] , and 1 mmol/L Na ; VO , , pH 8.0 ) for 30 minutes on ice .
The lysate was centrifuged ( 10 minutes at 1,000 g at 4°C ) to remove nuclei and cellular debris .
The supernatant was incubated head over head with anti-JAK2 polyclonal rabbit antiserum ( 1.5 4L/2 to 4 X 10° cell equivalents ) for 1 hour at 4°C before protein-G sepharose was added for an overnight incubation at 4°C .
Subsequently , the protein-G sepharose was washed six times with lysis buffer , two times with HEPES buffer containing 1 mmol/L Na ; VO , , and suspended in sample buffer ( 4 % sodium dodecyl sulfate [ SDS ] , 4 % A-mercaptoethanol , and 10 % glycerol , pH 6.8 ) .
Samples were run on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( 0.45 um ) , and blotted with an antiphosphotyrosine ( anti-PTyr ) MoAb ( 4G10 ) as primary antibody and peroxidase-conjugated goat-antimouse secondary antibody ( 1:4,000 ) as described before . ``
Immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Amers-ham , Buckinghamshire , UK ) .
Preparation of nuclear extracts .
- Nuclear extracts were prepared as described before with a few modifications . ``
In short , eosinophils ( > 5 x 10° cells/extraction ) were suspended in 400 gL hypotonic buffer ( 10 mmol/L HEPES-KOH , pH 7.9 , 1.5 mmol/L MgCl , , 10 mmol/L KCI , 0.5 mmol/L DTT , 0.2 mmol/L PMSF , 10 pg/mL aprotinin , and 1 mmol/L Na ; VO , ) and incubated on ice for 15 minutes .
Swollen cells and nuclei were pelleted and subsequently incubated 1443 on ice for 20 minutes in 50 uL hypertonic buffer ( 20 mmol/L HEPES-KOH , pH 7.9 , 1.5 mmol/L MgCl , , 420 mmol/L NaCl , 0.2 mmoI/L EDTA , 0.5 mmol/L DTT , 0.2 mmol/L PMSF , 10 ug/mL aprotinin , and 1 mmol/L Na ; VO , ) .
Hereafter , supernatants were col-lected , frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen , and stored at -80°C until use .
Electromobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
- Nuclear extracts ( 5 ug pro-tein ) were incubated ( 20 wL final volume ) for 30 minutes at room temperature in 10 mmol/L HEPES , pH 7.8 , 50 mmol/L KCI , 5 mmol/ L MgC ] ; , 1 mmol/L EDTA , 10 % glycerol ( wt/vol ) , 5 mmol/L DTT , 2 ug poly ( dI-dC ) , and 20 ug bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) with 0.1 to 1 ng of a P-labeled oligonucleotide ( 5'-agcttaggTTTCCGG-GAAAgcac-3 ' ) that is a previously described palindromic IL-6/IFN-y response element from the ICAM-1 promotor ( ICAM-1 pIRE ) . ``
Samples were loaded on a 5 % nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel , run for 3 hours at 150 V , fixed in 10 % ( vol/vol ) methanol and 10 % ( vol/vol ) acetic acid , vacuum dried , and exposed to Fuji RX film ( Fuji Photo Film Co Ltd , Japan ) at -70°C for 1 to 2 days .
For supershift analysis , nuclear extracts ( 5 ug ) were incubated for 1 hour on ice with 1 ug anti-PTyr MoAb ( 4G10 ) or the antibodies directed against the Stat proteins .
For competition analysis , nuclear extracts were preincubated for 10 minutes with 50- or 100-fold excess unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide or mutant oligonucleotide ( 5 ' -aggegegaggTTAGCGGTCAAgcagcacege-3 ' ) before the addition of P-labeled ICAM-1 pIRE .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Effect of IL-5 on tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 .
Although it has been reported that IL-5 clearly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular substrates , `` it is currently unknown which kinase ( s ) are involved in IL-5 signaling .
We focused our attention on JAK kinases , because these tyrosine kinases are activated by several cytokines , including IL-3 and GM-CSF . ``
Activation of JAK kinases is associated with phosphorylation of these kinases on tyrosine resi-dues , probably because of autophosphorylation . ``
'' As shown in Fig 1 , IL-5 induced a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 as assessed by JAK2 immunoprecipita-tion , followed by Western blotting with an anti-PTyr MoAb ( 4G10 ) .
TYK2 is not phosphorylated on tyrosine upon IL-5 treatment ( results not shown ) .
Interestingly , at 10 minutes , a second protein ( +155 kD ) phosphorylated on tyrosine consistently appeared that coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 .
Time course of IL-5-induced DNA-binding complexes with the ICAM-1 pIRE .
- Activation of JAK kinases is important for the subsequent activation of Stat proteins . ``
This finding prompted us to study whether IL-5 could induce DNA-binding factors that bind to the gamma activated site ( GAS ) -like element of the ICAM-1 promotor , ICAM-1 pIRE ( 5'-agettaggTTTCCGGGAAAgcac-3 ' ) , that we have previously shown to bind Stat proteins . ``
ICAM-1 can be induced on human eosinophils `` and is an important adhesion molecule in allergic inflammation .
Therefore , the ICAM-1 pIRE was considered an appropriate model system to study IL-5 signaling .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from eosinophils , which were treated with IL-5 ( 5 x 10~ ' `` mol/L ) .
These extracts were used for an EMSA with the [ `` P ] -ICAM-1 pIRE .
IL-5 induced at least two DNA-binding complexes , which are indicated as cl and c2 ( Fig 2 ) .

Human eosinophils ( 10 x 10° cells/mL ) were treated with buffer ( C ) or IL-5 ( 5 x 10~ ' `` mol/L ) for the indicated times at 37°C .
Subsequently , JAK2 was immunoprecipitated and used for Western blot with an anti-PTyr MoAb ( 4G10 ) followed by ECL ( upper panel ) .
Blots were reprobed with the JAK2 antiserum to check for immunoprecipitation efficiency ( lower panel ) .

binding complexes was optimal after 15 minutes and decreased to basal levels after 2.5 hours .
The c1 and c2 complexes were specific , as shown in Fig 3 .
Formation of the c1 and c2 complexes was completely inhibited in the presence of excess ( 50- or 100-fold ) unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide .
Excess mutant oligonucleotide ( 5S'-aggegegaggTTAGCGGTCAAgcagcacege-3 ' ) did not affect the c1 and c2 complex formation with the P-labeled wild-type probe , even at 100-fold excess ( Fig 3 ) .
Supershift analysis of the IL-5- and IFN-y-induced DNA-binding factors .
In marked contrast to IL-5 , which induced at least two ICAM-1 pIRE binding complexes , IFN-y induced a single DNA-binding complex ( Fig 4 ) .
To characterize the proteins binding to the ICAM-1 pIRE , we performed supershift analysis of the ICAM-1 pIRE/protein complexes with antibodies raised against Stat proteins .
As shown in Fig 4 , the complex that was induced by IFN-y was clearly supershifted by an antiserum specifically directed against Statlae , indicating that this ICAM-1 pIRE/protein complex contained Statle .
An MoAb directed against an epitope that is present in Statla and Stat1/3 also supershifted this complex ( Fig 4 ) .
These results are in agreement with those of other studies , demonstrating that IFN-y induces a Statle homodimer . ``
When the same experiments were performed with ICAM-1 pIRE/protein complexes induced by IL-5 ( 30 minutes of treatment ) , the faster migrating complex ( c2 ) of the doublet was supershifted with the MoAb against Statla/ $ 3 , although the signal intensity of the complex decreased .
Inhibition of VAN DER BRUGGEN ET AL the IFN-y-induced DNA-binding complex by this antibody can not be observed in this figure because of overexposure of the film .
At much shorter exposure times , the IFN-y-induced DNA-binding complex and the IL-5-induced c2 complex were similarly inhibited by the anti-Statl « /3 MoAb ( data not shown ) .
The Statla-specific antiserum supershifted the c2 complex induced by IL-5 to the top of the lane , similar to the supershift of the IFN-y-induced DNA-binding complex ( Fig 4 ) .
Isotype antibody controls for anti-Statla/ B MoAb ( mouse IgG1 ) and the Statlae-specific antiserum ( nonimmune rabbit antiserum ) had no effect on both IL-5-induced DNA-binding complexes ( results not shown ) .
These data indicate that Statla is induced by IL-5 in human eosinophils .

Nuclear extracts were incubated with 50- or 100-fold excess unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide ( lanes 2 and 3 ) or mutant oligonucleotide ( 5'-aggegegaggTTAGCGGTC-AAgcagcacegc-3 ' ; lanes 4 and 5 ) 10 minutes before incubation with the P-labeled ICAM-1 pIRE .

Interestingly , the slower migrating complex ( cl ) was partially inhibited by both antibodies , suggesting that this complex contains a Statla-related protein or Statla as part of a heterodimer .
Possibly , the anti-Statle and -Statla/ # $ MoAbs recognize an epitope that is masked in a putative heterodimer complex , explaining the partial , rather than total , inhibition of the cl complex .
We next addressed the question of whether phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is important for the IL-5-induced proteins to bind to the ICAM-1 pIRE .
As shown in Fig 4 , preincubation of an MoAb ( 4G10 ) directed against PTyr inhibits the formation of the c1/c2 complexes , suggesting the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation for DNA binding .
Similar results were found with another anti-PTyr MoAb , PY20 ( data not shown ) .
Others have shown that phosphorylation of a single tyrosine residue ( Tyr'® ' ) in Statlae is neces- 1445 sary for nuclear translocation and DNA-binding . ``
'' When the MoAb was saturated with soluble phosphotyrosine , thereby inhibiting the binding of the MoAb , the inhibition of the formation of ICAM-1 pIRE/Stat complexes was eliminated .

IL-3- and GM-CSF~induced DNA-binding complexes contain Stat proteins .
Human eosinophils were incubated for 30 minutes with IL-3 ( 10~° mol/L ) or GM-SF ( 10~° mol/L ) at 37°C .
Nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated ( 5 mg/lane ) for 60 minutes at 0°C with no MoAb ( lanes 1 and 4 ) , MoAb directed against Stat91/84 ( Statie/ B , 1 ug ; lanes 2 and 5 ) , or a polyclonal antiserum directed against Stat91 ( Statia , 1 ug ; lanes 3 and 6 ) before the addition of [ *P ] -ICAM-1 pIRE .

mol/L ) and IL-3 ( 10 ~* mol/L ) also induced at least two DNA-binding complexes in gelshift assays using nuclear extracts of human eosinophils and the P ICAM-1 pIRE ( see Fig 5 ) .
Interestingly , relative high concentrations ( 10~° mol/L ) of GM-CSF were needed for substantial induction of the two DNA-binding complexes , whereas it has been reported that VAN DER BRUGGEN ET AL GM-CSF primes eosinophil function at picomolar concentra-tions . ``
Again , in supershift experiments , it is shown that the faster migrating complex c2 supershifted with the antiserum specific for Statla and the MoAb directed against the epitope found in both Statle and Stat13 .
These findings indicate that IL-3 and GM-CSF can induce Statla in normal human eosinophils .
The upper complex c1 was partially inhibited by both antibodies , suggesting that this complex also contains a Statla-related protein or Statla as a heterodimer .
It should be noted that donor variation existed with respect to the signals of the cl and , especially , the c2 complex .
However , the c1 and c2 complexes were found in the majority of the experiments and the c2 complex was always supershifted with the anti-Statla and anti-Statla « / $ 3 antibodies .
In marked contrast to this study , others have shown that , in monocytes , U937 cells , and cells , IL-3 and GM-CSF induce a single complex that is neither supershifted nor inhibited by anti-Statle antibodies but is able to bind to GAS oligonucleotides .
`` `` * ' However , it is reported that IL-3 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Statla , although signals were rather low . ``
It was found that IL-5 induced a DNA-binding complex in human basophils ; however , no supershift experiments were performed to further analyze this com-plex .
* ' The reason why Statla DNA-binding activity is not induced by IL-3 and GM-CSF in the aforementioned studies is not clear , but might reflect a difference in binding affinity and/or specificity of Stat proteins for the oligonucleotides used in those studies and ours , ie , the GAS element of the Ly6E promotor and the IFN-y response region of the FeyRI promotor versus the ICAM-1 pIRE .
`` `` * ' Alternatively , the different cell types possibly determine the pattern of Stat proteins ( and/or other transcription factors as well ) that are induced by IL-3 and GM-CSF .
IL-3 , GM-CSF , and IFN-y induce the expression of several molecules on the cell surface of eosinophils , such as the IL-2 receptor pSS chain , CD4 , and ICAM-I expression is markedly induced by TNF-a together with IFN-y , GM-CSF , IL-3 , or IL-5.5° In the case of the ICAM-1 gene , a Stat-binding element has been identified . ``
Characterization of other genes encoding cell surface proteins induced by IL-5 , IL-3 , GM-CSF , or IFN-y possibly shows Stat binding sequences in the promotor region as well .
This would provide a molecular basis for regulation of these genes upon addition of these cytokines to human eosinophils .
In conclusion , IL-5 signaling in human eosinophils involves tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and the induction of DNA-binding complexes containing Statla and , possibly , a Stat-related factor .
NOTE ADDED IN PROOF After the submission of this manuscript , Sato et al ( J Exp Med 180:2101 , 1994 ) reported that IL-5 induces activation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase in an mIL-5-dependent murine early B-cell line ( Y¥16 ) .
