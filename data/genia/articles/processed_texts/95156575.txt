PAYA'* Department of Immunology and Division of Experimental Pathology , `` Mayo Clinic , Rochester , Minnesota 55905 , and Department of Molecular Biology , Institut Pasteur , Paris , France® Received 18 July 1994/Accepted 29 November 1994 The mechanisms regulating human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) persistence in human monocytes/macrophages are partially understood .
Persistent HIV infection of U937 monocytic cells results in NF-KB activation .
Whether virus-induced NF-KB activation is a mechanism that favors continuous viral replication in macrophages remains unknown .
To further delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of NF-KB in HIV-infected monocytes and macrophages , we have focused on the regulation of the IB molecules .
First , we show that persistent HIV infection results in the activation of NF-B not only in monocytic cells but also in macrophages .
In HIV-infected cells , IxBa protein levels are decreased secondary to enhanced protein degradation .
This parallels the increased IxBa synthesis secondary to increased gene transcription , i.e .
, increased RNA and transcriptional activity of its promoter-enhancer .
Another protein with IB function , p105 , is also modified in HIV-infected cells : p105 and p50 steady-state protein levels are increased as a result of increased synthesis and proteolytic processing of p105 .
Transcriptional activity of p105 is also increased in infected cells and is also mediated by NF-KB through a specific xB motif .
These results demonstrate the existence of a triple autoregulatory loop in monocytes and macrophages involving HIV , p105 and p50 , and MAD3 , with the end result of persistent NF-KB activation and viral persistence .
Furthermore , persistent HIV infection of monocytes and macrophages provides a useful model with which to study concomitant modifica- tions of different IB molecules .
Human monocytes and macrophages are persistent reservoirs of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ( 20 , 26 , 27 , 39 , 47 , 48 , 54 ) .
While high numbers of productively infected macrophages have been found in the brain ( 39 ) and lymph nodes ( 54 ) of infected patients , little is known about the mechanisms regulating HIV persistence in these relevant host cells .
Viral replication is in part controlled by specific viral proteins .
Tat , a regulatory viral protein generated in the first cycles of viral transcription , increases and sustains viral replication by acting through the tar region in the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( 16 , 22 , 35 , 44 ) .
In some models , tat requires the interaction with cis-acting sequences present in the LTR and is known to bind cellular transcription factors such as NF-kB and Sp1 ( 8 , 25 , 36 , 56 , 68 , 72 ) .
While both of these transcription factors play an essential role in the initial LTR-driven transcription of HIV , their potential function in regulating viral persistence in macrophages remains unknown .
NF-KB is an inducible transcription factor that regulates the expression of a large number of genes , including that of HIV ( 29 , 51 ) .
The classic NF-kB complex is a heterodimer of p50 ( NF-kB1 ) and p65 ( RelA ) ( 38 , 52 , 66 ) .
Each subunit belongs to a family of proteins with homology to the product of the c-re/ proto-oncogene ( 67 ) .
Other members include p52 ( NF-kB2 ) ( 10 , 63 ) , ReIB ( 19 , 61 ) , and the Drosophila homolog , dorsal ( 33 ) .
Different homodimeric and heterodimeric combinations of these c-Rel-related molecules transactivate specific genes in response to different cellular activation signals ( 3 ) .
Much of this activation specificity is regulated by a variety of inhibitory molecules known as IxBs ( 42 ) .

1500 the transactivating potential of Rel-related molecules by their sequestration in the cytoplasm .
IxB molecules with these features include IKxBa ( 2 , 4 , 28 , 30 ) , IxBB ( 74 ) , pp40 ( 17 ) , IxBy ( 32 ) , and the precursor proteins of p50 and p52 , p105 ( NF-B1 ) and p100 ( NF- « kB2 ) , respectively ( 43 , 58 , 62 , 71 ) .
The cDNA of IxBa ( MAD3 ) was isolated from a macrophage li-brary , and the protein was shown to specifically inhibit the DNA binding of p50 and p65 ( 30 ) .
Such inhibition is mediated by physically masking the nuclear localization signal within p65 , resulting in the cytoplasmic retention of the p50/p65 heterodimeric complex ( 7 ) .
NF-kB translocation to the nucleus requires at least its dissociation from IxBa ( 2 , 4 , 5 ) .
While the mechanisms leading to NF- « xB/IxBa dissociation in the cytosol remain to be fully characterized , phosphorylation of IxBa ( MAD3 ) occurring at the time of its dissociation from NF-kB has been documented in vitro ( 26 ) and in vivo ( 6 , 15 , 24 , 69 , 71 ) preceding its degradation by cellular proteases ( 6 , 12 , 15 , 24 , 31 , 53 , 70 , 71 ) .
Whether phosphorylation is necessary for subsequent degradation remains to be clarified .
p105 and p100 generate p50 and p52 upon proteolytic cleavage but also p65/ p50 or p65/p52 complexes when p105 or p100 , respectively , binds p65 ( 43 , 58 , 62 , 71 ) .
Which stimuli and through which mechanisms the pool of p65 anchored by p105 and p100 can be translocated to the nucleus are unknown .
Therefore , p65/p50 or p65/p52 complexes can be regulated in the cytosol by at least two independent mechanisms , one regulated by IxBa and the other regulated by p105 and p100 .
Within the nucleus , NF- « B regulates the transcriptional activity of products of many viral and cellular genes ( 3 , 41 ) , including members of the rel family ( p105 , the precursor of p50 [ 62 , 73 ] ) and IxBa ( 12 , 13 , 40 , 57 , 65 , 70 ) .
The promoter regions of the genes encoding p105 and IxBa contain functional NF- « B consensus binding sequences ( 40 , 73 ) , and p100 transcription is NF-kB dependent ( 71 ) .
Therefore , transloca- Vou .
69 , 1995 tion of NF-kB following cell activation increases IxBa , p105 , and p100 transcription , replenishing the cytoplasmic store of such proteins .
Newly assembled NF- « B will bind IxBa and/or p105 , becoming anchored in the cytosol and restoring the cell to a prestimulatory ( resting ) state .
HIV infection of U937 monocytic cells results in increased nuclear translocation of NF- « B ( 1 , 55 , 60 ) .
The impact of this interaction in favoring viral persistence is unknown .
To determine whether NF-kB activation by HIV plays a role in the regulation of HIV persistence in human monocytes and macrophages , we need to more fully understand the mechanisms by which HIV activates NF-kB , and in particular , if these mechanisms are similar to the ones previously described for transient stimuli ( phorbol myristate acetate [ PMA ] , tumor necrosis factor [ TNF ] , etc . )
.
Furthermore , it is important to investigate such mechanisms in more physiologically and relevant human host cells of HIV such as macrophages ( 29 ) .
In this study , we have performed a systematic analysis of the different levels of NF-kB regulation in HIV-infected monocytes and , more importantly , in human macrophages by focusing in the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of IxBa and p105 .
Here we show that HIV infection enhances NF- « kB DNA binding not only in U937 monocytic cells but also in human macrophages .
Analysis of p105 and p50 demonstrates increased steady-state protein levels secondary to increased protein synthesis of p105 and subsequent proteolysis to p50 in HIV-infected cells .
This is secondary to increased transcription of the p105 promoter through a specific xB motif .
On the contrary , steady-state protein levels of IxBa are decreased in HIV-infected monocytes and macrophages as a result of increased degradation .
Increased IxBa synthesis regulated by NF- « kB dependent transcriptional mechanisms compensates for the increased proteolysis .
These results indicate that HIV infection in monocytes/macrophages results in a chronic and persistent activation of NF-kB by means of a triple positive autoregulatory loop composed of p105 , IxBa , and HIV .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and HIV infection .
U937 promonocytic cells ( purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ) were grown in RPMI with 5 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( Intergen ) , infected with the HIV LAV-Bru strain as previously described ( 1 , 55 ) , and studied from days 30 to 90 postinfection .
During this period , infected cells are over 95 % viable .
Human macrophages were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient separation from buffy coats obtained from our blood bank .
A total of 75 x 10° peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated in 10 % human AB serum ( Gibco ) for 5 days in T75 flasks .
Thereafter , nonadherent cells were removed , and the adherent population was infected with monocytotropic HIV strains ( JR/FL and SF/162 ) obtained from the AIDS Reference and Reagent Repository .
Over 95 % of adherent cells are positive for nonspecific sterase and CD14 surface expression .
Macrophages were harvested 3 to 4 weeks postinfection .
HIV infection of U937 cells and human macrophages was monitored by reverse transcriptase activity and p24 assays ( Cellular Products , Inc. , Buffalo , N.Y. ) .
The percentage of U937 cells and macrophages infected at the time of harvesting was determined by permeabilizing the cells and labeling them with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated p24 ( Virostat , Portland , Maine ) .
Flu-orescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed a significant shift in the entire population ( a single shifted peak ) , indicating that over 80 % of cells were HIV infected .
As previously described ( 1 , 49 , 50 , 55 ) , HIV infection of U937 cells and macrophages did not result in the production of cytokines known to activate NF- « B ( TNF-a , interleukin-1 , and interleukin-6 ) .

For mobility shift assays , 4 to 6 ug of protein extract was incubated with [ y `` `` PJATP-labeled double-stranded oligode-oxynucleotide probe at room temperature for 15 min in 10 to 15 pl of binding buffer as previously described ( 1 , 55 ) .
The binding reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis in a nondenaturing 5 % polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography .
DNA binding competition was assessed by preincubating the extract with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide .
The oligonucleotide used in the binding reaction corresponded to the NF-kB binding sequence present within the enhancer of the HIV LTR ( 5'-ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCT GGGGACTTTCCAGGGA-3 ' ) .
The double-stranded probe was end labeled with [ « -*°P ] dCTP by using polynucleotide kinase .

Gel shift analysis of NF- « B DNA binding .
A double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the NF- « B-binding sequences of the enhancer region of the HIV LTR was used as a probe and incubated with nuclear proteins extracted from non infected ( NI ) and HIV-infected U937 cells ( 6 pg per sample ) and with nuclear extracts from human macrophages ( 4 jg per sample ) .
Lanes : 1 , 6 , 9 , and 13 , nuclear extract only ; 2 , 7 , 10 , and 14 , nuclear extract preincubated with anti-p50 ; 3 , 8 , 11 , and 15 , nuclear extract preincubated with anti-p65 ; 4 , 9 , 12 , and 16 , nuclear extract preincubated with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide .

iments , a polyclonal anti-IxBa « ( MAD3 ) serum generated by using a glutathione S-transferase-MAD3 fusion protein or an anti-p105/p50 serum raised against a glutathione S-transferase-p105 fusion was also used .
Transfections .
U937 cells ( 10 `` per point ) were electroporated with 5 to 10 pg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 10 g of control TK-B-Gal , using a Bethesda Research Laboratories Cell-Porator ( 800 wF and 300 V ) ; 2 x 10° transfected cells were harvested 8 h later , using cell culture lysis reagent ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) , and B-Gal activity was detected by using the Tropix Galacto-Light reporter assay ( 34 ) .
The rest of the sample ( 8 X 10° cells ) was harvested by the same procedure 16 to 20 h later , and luciferase levels were measured by using the Promega luciferase assay system .
Both B-Gal and luciferase were measured in a Berthold Lumat .
Total protein in an aliquot of each sample was measured by the Bradford technique ( Bio-Rad ) as described above .
Results are presented as luciferase units/B-Gal units .
[ **S ] methionine labeling and i p ion .
U937 cells ( 10 `` per point ) were incubated in methionine-free medium ( ICN ) for 30 min and then labeled with 1 mCi of [ *°S ) methionine-cysteine ( 32 X 10° ) cells for different time peri-ods .
For chase experiments , cells were centrifuged and resuspended in regular ( methionine- and cysteine-containing ) medium for different lengths of time .
Cytosolic fractions were obtained by lysing cells in a lysis buffer ( pH 7.5 ; 50 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X-100 , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 50 mM NaF , 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 2 ug of aprotinin per ml , 2 pg of leupeptin per ml , 2 ug of pepstatin per ml ) .

RESULTS Increased NF-KB DNA-binding activity in HIV-Infected monocytes and macrophages .
Increased NF-kB DNA binding has been described in monocytic cell lines infected with HIV ( 1 , 55 , 60 ) .
We first wanted to determine whether this phenomenon is present in a more relevant host cell such as macrophages .
Human macrophages derived from peripheral blood monocytes were mock infected ( supernatant of phytohemag-glutinin-interleukin-2-treated peripheral blood lymphocytes in the absence of virus ) or infected with the HIV strain SF/162 .
HIV-infected macrophages contained increased NF- « kB DNA binding as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( Fig .
1 ) .
Infection with other monocytotropic strains such as JR/FL , Ada , and Bal also resulted in NF-kB activation , while mock infection or infection with LAV-Bru did not result in HIV infection or NF- « B activation ( not shown ) .
The HIV-dependent NF-kB activation present in human macrophages is increased over the baseline NF-kB DNA-binding activity nor mally present in human macrophages ( 29 ) .
Preincubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies specific for the different NF- « B subunits as well as competition with an excess of unlabeled NF- « B DNA-binding oligonucleotide demonstrated that the NF-kB-like complex present in both HIV-infected macrophages and monocytic cell lines consists of a p50/p65 het-erodimer .
The anti-c-Rel antibody did not modify the nuclear DNA-binding complex , while it upshifted a DNA-binding complex present in the nuclei of the B-cell line BJAB ( not shown ) .
IxBa undergoes posttranslational modifications in HIV-infected monocytes and macrophages .
Having shown that HIV-induced NF- « B activation occurs not only in monocytic cell lines but also in a more relevant host cell target such as human macrophages , we next investigated whether IxB molecules are regulated by persistent HIV infection in these cells .
IxBa is one key molecule in regulating NF- « B translocation from the cytosol to the nuclei , as shown by the fact that transient cell stimuli such as TNF , LPS , or PMA ( 12 , 70 ) result in its phosphorylation and subsequent degradation ( 6 , 12 , 15 , 24 , 57 , 70 , 71 ) .
Immunoblotting experiments of cytosolic fractions from HIV-infected and uninfected U937 cells and human macrophages demonstrate that the steady-state levels of IxBa are persistently decreased in infected compared with uninfected cells ( Fig .
2A , lanes 3 and 5 ) .
We next investigated whether decreased cytosolic IxBa in infected cells is secondary to decreased protein synthesis or , alternatively , results from increased protein degradation as would be expected following treatment with stimuli such as LPS ( Fig .
2A , lane 2 ) .
Results of pulse-chase [ °°S ] methionine-cysteine labeling experiments followed by IkxBa immunoprecipitation ( Fig .
2B ) indicate that both the synthesis rate ( pulse time , 0 min ) and IxBa degradation ( 60- and 180-min chases are increased in infected cells compared with uninfected cells .
To specifically analyze whether the IxBa molecule suscegtible to degradation was associated with NF-kB , additional *°S pulse-chase experiments were performed .
The entire complex was immunoprecipitated with the anti-p65 or anti-p105/p50 antibody .
Increased IxBa synthesis ( pulse time , 0 min ) and degradation ( 180-mm chase ) were present while the protein was associated with NF-kB , as determined by immunoprecipitating p65 ( Fig .
2C ) or p105/p50 ( see Fig .
4B ) .
The half-lives of calculated from Fig .
2B were 187 mm in uninfected cells and 103 min in infected cells .
Similar results were obtained from Fig .

Cellular sublocalization , synthesis and processing , and steady-state RNA levels of IxBa ( MAD3 ) .
( A ) Cytosolic proteins from U937 cells and human macrophages were extracted , subjected to SDS-PAGE , transferred , and immu-noblotted with anti-IxBa ( MAD3 ) antibodies .
Equal amounts of protein were run in all lanes .
LPS stimulation of U937 cells was done with a concentration of 1 g/ml for 2 h. NL , noninfected .
( B ) U937 cells were labeled with [ **SJmethi-onine for 2 h , chased with unlabeled methionine-containing medium for the indicated time , lysed , immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with anti-I « Ba « ( MAD3 ) , and analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
The amounts of *° $ labeling of non-IxBa-related proteins were equal in all lanes .

PMA stimulation of U937 cells was done with a concentration of 20 ng/ml for 2 h. or is directly caused by a cellular and/or viral protease independently from phosphorylation remains unknown .
Transcriptional regulation of IxBa in HIV-infected monocytes and macrophages .
We next assessed whether increased IxBa synthesis in HIV-infected monocytic cells and macrophages is secondary to increased gene transcription .
Northern blot analysis indicates that steady-state levels of IxBa RNA are also increased in HIV-infected monocytes and macrophages compared with uninfected cells ( Fig .
2D ) .
To further determine whether such increase is a result of enhanced gene transcription of the MAD3 enhancer-promoter , we performed transient transfections of the IxBa promoter cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in uninfected and HIV-infected monocytic cells .
A TK-B-Gal reporter gene was cotransfected to control for transfection efficiency .
As shown in Fig .
3A , increased NF-xB activity is present in HIV-infected cells compared with uninfected cells as determined by increased luciferase production of an NF-kB concatemer-luciferase reporter gene which is also upregulated by LPS in uninfected cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
Similarly , the IxBa enhancer-promoter-luciferase construct is transcriptionally upregulated both in HIV-infected ( compared with uninfected ) cells ( Fig .
3C ) and in uninfected cells treated with LPS ( Fig .
3D ) .
To determine whether the IxBa upregulation by HIV is NF- « B dependent , a deleted IxBa luciferase construct was transfected into uninfected and HIV-infected cells .
As shown in Fig .
3C , deletion of the xB site within the IxBa promoter significantly reduces the HIV-me-diated upregulation of the wild-type IxBa promoter as well as IxBa AND p105 REGULATION IN HIV-INFECTED MACROPHAGES 1503 that induced by LPS ( Fig .
3D ) .
Altogether , these results indicate that increased IxBa synthesis in HIV-infected cells is secondary to transcriptional upregulation of the promoter of the gene by NF-KB itself .
Regulation of p105 in HIV-infected cells .
Other molecules aside from IxBa are involved in the regulation of NF- « B .
p105 and p100 anchor p65 in the cytosol , resulting in an inactive pool of p65 .
Proteolytic cleavage of each precursor potentially leads to the formation of p65/pS50 and p65/pS52 complexes , respectively , that theoretically , are then free to undergo nuclear translocation .
Even though our data point to IxBa as a key regulatory molecule targeted by persistent HIV infection to result in continuous NF-KB translocation , we can not exclude that this chronic stimulus also regulates other functional IxB proteins such as p105 .
To further investigate this possibility , we first analyzed the steady-state protein level of p105 in uninfected and HIV-infected monocytic cells and human macrophages .
Cytosolic fractions of infected monocytic cells and human macrophages contain increased steady-state levels of p105 and p50 ( Fig .
4A ) .
To investigate whether p105 synthesis and , possibly , the proteolytic cleavage of p105 into p50 are upregulated , we performed metabolic pulse-chase labeling experiments using [ **S ) Jmethionine-cysteine followed by p105/ p50 immunoprecipitation .
As shown in Fig .
4B , increased synthesis of p105 is already present in total cell extracts of HIV-infected cells after 20 min of pulse-labeling ( time 0 ) compared with uninfected cells .
Chase with unlabelled methionine and cysteine indicates that the amount of *°S-labeled p105 is not modified in uninfected cells after 120 min , while a reduction of -labeled p105 is observed within the same period in HIV-infected cells .
*°S-p50 , presumably resulting from p105 proteolytic processing , is already present in the 20-min pulse time in both uninfected and HIV-infected cells .
However , a moderate increase in °°8-p50 is observed in the chase point in HIV-infected cells compared with uninfected cells .
To confirm this result , p105 and p50 *°S-labeled bands were scanned by den-sitometry .
The ratios of p105 to p50 in uninfected cells were 0.492 and 0.486 for the pulse and chase points , respectively ; while in the HIV-infected cells , the ratios were 0.661 ( pulse ) and 0.501 ( chase ) .
These results suggest that p105 synthesis is increased in HIV-infected cells and that the processing of p105 into p50 is moderately enhanced in these cells compared with uninfected controls .
Whether induced p105 proteolysis is mediated by a viral protease directly , as suggested previously in acute HIV infection in T lymphocytes ( 59 ) , or by cellular protease ( s ) such as via activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( 53 ) by HIV , remains unknown .
Regardless of the mechanism , these results provide evidence that a persistent stimulus such as HIV can induce the modification of at least two inhibitory molecules to result in continuous NF-kB activation .
p105 transcriptional activity is upregulated in HIV-infected monocytes ; role of the B3 motif in the p105 enhancer-promoter .
Increased synthesis of p105 is probably regulated by transcriptional mechanisms as shown to be the case of IxBa regulation in infected cells .
Our group had previously shown that the native p105 enhancer-promoter is upregulated by NF-kB and that its transcriptional activity in HIV-infected monocytic cells is also increased ( 55 , 73 ) .
Moreover , as shown in Fig .
4C , Northern blot analysis of RNA from uninfected and HIV-infected monocytic cells indicates increased steady-state RNA of p105 in HIV-infected cells We next investigated through which region ( s ) of the promoter-enhancer of the p105 gene was mediating its upregulation via HIV infection .
To do so , a detailed study of the different kB and other cis-acting motifs present in the p105 promoter was performed .

In all experiments , luciferase activity was normalized to the B-Gal activity of a TK-B-Gal plasmid .
The relative fold induction by HIV or LPS is indicated over each bar .
This is a representative experiment of at least three additional experiments .
quencing of the promoter identified the two already described kB sequences ( B1 and and an additional one ( B3 ) which overlaps a putative HIP1/E2F motif ( Fig .
5A ) .
The DNA-binding activity of each of these four motifs ( « Bl , B2 , « B3 , and HIP1/E2F ) was analyzed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays using labeled oligonucleotides of each of these sequences .
Results from these experiments indicate that the three kB motifs but not HIP1/E2F bind a nuclear protein ( s ) induced by LPS or HIV in U937 cells .
This DNA-binding activity was identified as NF-kB , the kB3 motif being the one that conferred the highest DNA-binding activity of the three kB motifs ( data not shown ) .
Using transfection experiments , we next tested which of the four cis-acting motifs in the p105 promoter mediates its upregulation by stimuli that activate NF-kB in uninfected and in HIV-infected cells ( see Fig .

Deletions of the four motifs in the wild-type p105 promoter ( see Materials and Methods ) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis and tested in transfection experiments .
In uninfected cells , the wild-type p105 and the A « B2 and AHIP1 constructs were responsive to a cotransfected p65 expression plasmid , while the A « B1 motif and , to a higher degree , the AxB3 motif were less respon-sive , suggesting that ( and to a lesser degree kB1 ) mediates p65 transactivation of the wild-type p105 ( Fig .

DISCUSSION Human monocytes and macrophages are a main reservoir of persistent HIV replication in infected individuals ( 20 , 26 , 27 ) .
The precise mechanisms regulating viral persistence in these host cells still remain elusive .
NF- « B is an important participant in the transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR ( 51 ) .
Whether it plays a role in sustaining viral replication through interactions with regulatory viral proteins such as Tat is not known .
It has been previously shown that persistent HIV infection of monocytic cells results in NF- « B activation ( 1 , 55 , 60 ) .
We hypothesize that this unique virus-host cell transcription factor interaction is important for the regulation of viral persistence in these cells .
In order to interrupt this interaction that could potentially lead to decreased viral replication , it is mandatory to understand ( i ) how NF-B is regulated in human monocytic cells and ( ii ) how HIV infection influences NF-kB regulation .
In this study , we show that NF- « B activation by 1506 McELHINNY ET AL .

69 , 1995 HIV occurs not only in monocytic cells but more relevant , in human macrophages , and that two different IxB molecules , IxBa and p105 , are selectively modified by persistent HIV infection .
This would appear to result in continuous nuclear translocation of NF- « B and increased transcription of NF- « B-dependent promoters , such as p105 , IxBa , and HIV promot-ers .
Our studies indicate that the NF-kB complex translocated into the nucleus of infected monocytes and macrophages is a bona fide p50/p65 complex in which c-Rel is absent .
Because NF-kB and related family members are regulated by complex interactions with a variety of IxB molecules , we first investigated those IxBs which have been shown in vitro and in vivo to interact with p50 and p65 .
Candidate IxB molecules potentially implicated in regulating p65 and p50 in monocytic cells include IxBa and p105 or p100 .
Results from our studies indicate that persistent HIV infection is an example of a chronic stimulus which targets at least two different IxBs , IxBa and p105 .
IxBo undergoes posttranslational modifications ( degrada-tion with or without phosphorylation ) induced by signal transduction pathways triggered by a cellular stimulus such as TNF , LPS , or PMA .
Although the relevance of IxBa phosphorylation as a requisite for subsequent protein degradation remains to be shown , all of the punctual stimuli mentioned above have been unequivocally shown to result in IxBa degradation con-comitantly with NF- « B translocation ( 6 , 12 , 15 , 24 , 31 , 53 , 70 , 71 ) .
In the model of persistent HIV infection in which continuous NF- « B translocation is present , our results indicate that IxBa levels are persistently decreased within infected monocytic cells and macrophages , suggesting that IxBa is a target of HIV-dependent pathways that lead to its posttranslational modification ( s ) .
At this point , it is unclear whether HIV infection results in IxBa phosphorylation rendering the molecule susceptible to subsequent degradation or whether proteolysis occurs in the absence of specific phosphorylation .
Recently , persistent expression of human T-cell leukemia virus type I fax has been shown to increase IxBa degradation ( 37 , 69 ) preceded by its phosphorylation ( 69 ) .
Our preliminary data derived from immunoprecipitation experiments of °°P ; and [ °°S ] methionine-labeled cells indicate that IxBa is a phospho-protein in the resting state and that an additional , more slowly migrating phosphorylated form of IxBa is present in infected cells .
Confirming these results would imply that models of chronic NF- « B activation such as the one presented here may facilitate the study of the phosphorylation characteristics of IxBa and its regulation by different signal transduction pathways .
If phosphorylation and/or other posttranslational modifications are not involved in predisposing IxBa to subsequent degradation , our data would imply that at least a proteolytic mechanism is activated in HIV-infected cells .
Whether a cellular protease is upregulated by HIV infection such as via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway or whether the HIV protease itself ( 53 , 59 ) regulates IxBa degradation remains unknown .
Alternatively , continuous IxBa phosphorylation by HIV-dependent signal transduction pathways would suffice to render the molecule susceptible to normally functional cell proteolytic pathways .
The fact that newly synthesized IxBa undergoes some degree of proteolysis in resting nonactivated cells as shown in other studies ( 57 ) suggests that proteolytic pathways are functional .
The notion that increased IxBa proteolysis in HIV-infected cells occurs in the face of a compensatory but apparently insufficient enhanced protein synthesis is novel and helps to explain that persistently decreased IxBa levels result in continuous NF-kB translocation .
The transcriptional regulation of IxBa by NF- « kB has been clearly demonstrated and supports that concept of autoregu- IxBa AND p105 REGULATION IN HIV-INFECTED MACROPHAGES 1507 lation between NF-kB and IxBa ( 12 , 13 , 40 , 57 , 65 , 70 , 73 ) .
Transient stimuli that result in NF- « B translocation by inducing degradation of IxBa also increase its transcription .
This mechanism compensates the utilization ( degradation ) of IxBa and interrupts continuous NF- « B activation : newly synthesized IxBa will anchor NF- « B in the cytosol , avoiding its subsequent nuclear translocation unless new cell stimulation occurs .
In our model , in which HIV behaves as a persistent stimulus , this autoregulatory shutoff mechanism between NF- « B and IxBa is only partially functional , as demonstrated by the continuous NF- « B translocation .
Thus , it is not unexpected that increased levels of IxBa RNA and , more importantly , increased transcription of the IxBa enhancer-promoter via an NF- « B motif are present in HIV-infected cells in an attempt to compensate for the unbalanced IxBa degradation .
Other IxB molecules have been found to be functional in cells of monocytic origin .
Because p50/p65 is the main complex translocated to the nucleus in cells persistently infected with HIV , IxB molecules such as p105 and p100 could also participate in the regulation of NF- « B by HIV in monocytic cells .
In order for any of these molecules to generate p50- or pS2-containing p65 heterodimers , proteolytical cleavage of the precursor needs to occur ( 9 , 21 , 38 , 53 ) .
Although few data as to what physiological stimuli result in this cleavage are available , an underlying functional processing is continuously present in any resting cell to explain the continuous formation of p50 or p52 .
Although some reports indicate that processing of p105 or p100 can be increased by different stimuli ( TNF and LPS ) to result in p50 ( 46 , 75 ) , this has not been confirmed by others ( 71 ) , leaving the issue of p105 and p100 regulation open to further studies .
Our observation that a chronic stimulus such as HIV increases the processing of p105 implies that p50/p65 heterodimers aside from p50 homodimers can be generated by this mechanism independently targeting IxBa .
Because in our model IxBa levels are decreased , it is unlikely that p50/p65 heterodimers generated from p105 processing would be anchored by IxBa , therefore freeing them for nuclear translocation in the infected cells .
Preliminary data indicate that steady-state levels of p100 and p52 are also increased in HIV-infected compared with uninfected cells , although it is unknown if the processing of p100 as that described here for p105 is also increased .
Importantly , if functional differences in IxB activity exist between p105 and p100 , as already shown for differences in the transactivational activity of their proteolytic products p50 and p52 , respectively ( 63 ) , it will be important to perform detailed analysis of the regulation of both precursors by chronic stimuli such as HIV .
As in the case of IxBa , it remains unknown by which mechanisms persistent HIV infection increases the normal ongoing processing of p105 .
Although the HIV protease has been shown to cleave p105 in a model of acute HIV infection in T-lymphoblastoid cells , it is also possible that activation of already functional proteolytic pathways is upregulated by HIV-dependent mechanisms .
Lastly , our studies provide additional information on the transcriptional regulation of the p105 enhancer-promoter by stimuli that activate NF-kB , especially HIV .
Although our group has previously shown that NF- « B and HIV upregulate the transcription of the enhancer-promoter of this gene ( 55 ) , we have been interested in further characterizing whether HIV requires DNA-binding motifs different from those binding NF-xB .
To achieve this , we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the different NF- « B-binding motifs as well as an additional one , HIP1/E2F ( 45 ) .
By sequencing the mutated constructs , an extra NF-kB motif ( B3 ) overlapping the 5 ' region of the HIP1/E2F motif was noted .
A similar sequence was docu-mented , although not mentioned or analyzed , in a second 1508 McELHINNY ET AL .
report describing the enhancer-promoter of p105 ( 14 ) .
By performing electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transfection experiments addressing the role of each of the three kB motifs and the single HIP1 motif , we demonstrated that the xkB3 motif and not the HIP1 motif is the main regulatory region of the enhancer-promoter of the p105 gene by NF- « B and HIV in monocytic cells , implying that its upregulation of HIV is mainly mediated by its activation of NF-kB and not other transcription factors .
Of interest , the xB3 motif confers cell specificity .
Preliminary studies in B-cell lines indicate that the Epstein-Barr virus LMP-1 protein and LPS , both of which activate NF- « B and p105 transcription in these cells , upregulate the p105 promoter independently from the xB3 motif ( 44a ) .
Viruses and specific viral proteins have been listed among the different stimuli known to activate NF- « B ( 3 ) .
At least in the case of HIV and to a certain degree with Epstein-Barr virus , our data indicate that the increased activity triggered by persistent viral infection accompanies upregulation of cellular receptors and functions which may in part be NF-kB dependent , suggesting a functional role for the activation of this transcriptional factor .
Furthermore , persistent HIV infection of macrophages provides an example of how a continuous stimulus such as HIV can modify and upregulate cellular pathways that lead to NF-kB activation , specifically by modulating at least two separate and independent IxB molecules such as IxBa and p105 .
Advancing in our understanding of NF- « B regulation by HIV will allow determination of the role of this crucial transcription factor in the regulation of HIV persistence in human macrophages .
