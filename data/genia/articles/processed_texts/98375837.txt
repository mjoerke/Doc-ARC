IFN-y induction of MHCII requires new protein synthesis , specifically of the class II transactivator ( CIITA ) .
Mutations of CIITA have been identified in all MHCII-deficient cell lines from bare lymphocyte syndrome complementation group A. CIITA expression itself is induced by IFN-y ( 5 ) , apparently via the Janus kinase ( JAK ) -1/STAT-1 @ « pathway ( 6-8 ) .
Rather than binding to specific DNA sequences of the MHCII promoters , CIITA appears to interact directly with other transac-tivating factors ( 9-11 ) .
NK cells are the most efficient cellular inducers of EC class II molecules ( 3 ) .
Although NK cells are competent producers of IFN-y , NK-mediated HLA-DR induction at both the transcrip-tional and membrane level can be achieved in an IFN-y-independent manner ( 12 ) .
Direct NK cell to EC contact is required , and the B ; , integrin/ICAM-1 adhesion pathway is critical .
Additionally , NK cells induce HLA-DRa mRNA more rapidly than does IFN-y ( 12 ) , indicating that new protein synthesis may not be required .
Here , we provide evidence that the HLA-DRa expression induced by NK cells can be achieved not only in an IFN-y-independent manner , but also in the absence of CIITA expression .
HLA-DR mRNA and protein were induced by NK cells in mutant cell lines that were defective in MHCII and CHTA expression .
Additionally , HLA-DRa promoter constructs and mRNA were induced in a cell line that was deficient in JAK-1 , which is a regulatory kinase that is essential for CIITA induction by IFN-y .
Taken together , these results indicate a pathway of HLA-DR induction by NK cells that is not only independent of the IFN-yR , but also of CIITA , which was previously believed to be essential for the induction of MHCII molecules .
Materials and Methods Reagents Anti-CD56 mAb was obtained from BioSource International ( Camarillo , CA ) , IFN-y was supplied by Collaborative Biomedical Products ( Bedford , MA ) , and neutralizing anti-IFN-y was purchased from Genzyme ( Cam-bridge , MA ) .
Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University ( New Haven , CT ) .
All other Abs and reagents used were as described previously ( 12 ) .
Cell isolation and culture NK cells were isolated from leukocyte-enriched products from single healthy adult donors ; the products were obtained by leukopheresis that was performed at the Yale Pheresis Unit , as described previously ( 12 ) .
Immunodepletion ( negative panning ) led to NK cells that were > 96 % CD56* , CD16+* , CD3~ .
Single-donor HUVECs were isolated and cultured as described previously ( 12 ) and used at less than passage 6 .

The 2C4 , GZA , G3A , and U4A cell lines were obtained from George R. Stark ( Cleveland Clinic Foundation , Cleve-land , OH ) and maintained in high glucose DMEM ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10 % FBS .
Membrane HLA-DR induction assays and flow cytometry Flow cytometric analysis was performed as described previously ( 12 , 13 ) .
NK cell panning After recovering the NK /target cell coculture from plates with trypsiniza-tion , the panning of NK cells away from target cells was performed by immunodepletion with anti-CD16 , -CD45 , and -CD56 mAbs as described previously ( 12 ) .
RNA was purified from target cells that had been separated from NK cells and was subjected to RT-PCR ( see below ) with primers specific for CD45 to ensure complete NK cell depletion .
RNA analysis Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent ( Life Technologies ) and the phase lock gel system ( 5 Prime-3 Prime , Boulder , CO ) .
RT-PCR was performed using 1 ug of total RNA , Superscript II RNaseH~ reverse transcriptase ( Life Technologies ) , and oligo ( dT ) ; 5 primer ( Promega , Mad-ison , WI ) according to the manufacturers ' instructions .
PCR was performed as described previously ( 12 ) using the following primer pairs : HLA-DR « as described previously ( 12 ) ; human CIITA , nucleotides ( nt ) 2881-2901 and 3331-3351 ; human CD45 , nt 224-244 and 1059-1079 ; and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , nt 12-37 and 971-994 .
Ribonuclease protection assay ( RPA ) probes were generated using a MAXIscript kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) .
Both CIITA ( nt 3137-3496 ) and HLA-DRa ( nt 119-592 ) fragments in pBluescript ( Strat-agene , La Jolla , CA ) were transcribed using T7 polymerase in the presence of [ « -*PJuridine triphosphate ( 800 Ci/mmol ) ( DuPont New England Nu-clear , Wilmington , DE ) .
RPA was performed using total cellular RNA and a RPAII kit ( Ambion ) .
Plasmid constructs The HLA-DRa promoter human growth hormone ( HGH ) constructs that were kindly provided by Richard Flavell ( Yale University ) have been used by us previously ( 12 ) .
The luciferase reporter pGL2 control vector ( Promega ) was cotransfected as a normalization control .
Transient transfections Cells that had been plated to 50 % confluence were transfected for 8 h with 10 ug of each plasmid using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol ( 14 ) .
After glycerol shock , cells were fed fresh medium and left overnight to recover .
Fresh medium , medium containing 100 U/ml of IFN-y , or allogeneic NK cells were added and incubated for 48 h. The HGH secreted into the medium was determined using a *° [ -HGH radioimmunoassay kit ( Nichols Institute , San Juan Capistrano , CA ) , and the HGH that normalized to luciferase activity in cell extracts was determined using a luciferase assay system ( Promega ) and a Lumat LB 9501 ( Berthold , Wildbad , Ger-many ) luminometer .
Results and Discussion We demonstrated previously that allogeneic NK cells induce MHCII molecules on resting ECs in an IFN-y-independent , adhesion-dependent manner ( 12 ) .
To investigate the involved signaling path-ways , we took advantage of a series of cell lines that had been rendered MHCII-deficient by chemical mutagenesis ( 15 ) .
The cell line 2C4 , which was derived from the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 , was mutagenized with ICR-191 ; clones were selected that do not express surface MHCII molecules either at rest or in response to IFN-y .
One such cell line , GZA , shows partial HLA-DRa promoter occupancy , and MHCII expression can be complemented by an overexpression of CIITA ( K. Wright and J. Ting , personal communication ) .
We treated 2C4 and GZA with either 250 U/ml of IFN-y or allogeneic NK cells ( 20:1 NK : responder ratio ) for 72 h , followed by membrane HLA-DR analysis by flow cytometry .
Figure 1 shows that both IFN-y and NK cells induce the surface expression of HLA-DR in the parental cell line 2C4 .

Flow cytometric analysis of NK cell-induced membrane HLA-DR on IFN-y-signaling mutant GZA cells .
Confluent monolayers of parental 2C4 cells ( A and C ) and IFN-y-signaling mutant GZA cells ( B and D ) were pretreated with medium alone , medium containing 250 U/ml of IFN-y ( A and B ) , or allogeneic NK cells ( C and D ) at a 20:1 NK : responder ratio including saturating quantities of anti-IFN-y Abs .
Cells were harvested after 72 h and stained with anti-HLA-DR-phycoerythrin .
In the coculture samples , NK cells were gated out with simultaneous anti-CD45-FITC staining , which eliminated NK cell HLA-DR. All curves represent the membrane HLA-DR expressed in 5000 cytometer-acquired target cells .
described earlier , IFN-y failed to induce HLA-DR in the G2A cell line , but GZA retained NK cell responsiveness with a significant induction of membrane HLA-DR when cocultured with NK cells .
This finding is consistent with previous observations of IFN-y-independent , endothelial HLA-DR induction by NK cells and also provided a system whereby this phenomenon could be analyzed at the level of transcription .
In cells that do not constitutively express class II molecules , MHCII gene activation is required for induction .
HLA-DRa gene transcription is not directly and immediately induced by IFN-y , but does require new protein synthesis , specifically of CITA ( reviewed in Ref .
1 ) .
The kinetics of EC HLA-DRa mRNA induction by allogeneic NK cells are faster than those by IFN-y ( 12 ) , which led us to investigate whether newly synthesized CIITA is required for HLA-DRa induction by NK cells .
We again took advantage of the class II-negative GZA cell line and of an additional cell line , G3A , that had been generated by the same means ; G3A is CIITA and class II negative and is complemented to wild-type IFN-y-mediated MHCII inducibility by expression of rCIITA ( 16 ) .
HUVECs and 2C4 , GZA , and G3A cells were incubated for 8 h in the presence of either 100 U/ml of IFN-y or NK cells ( 12:1 NK : responder ratio ) .
For the NK cell treatments , the responder cells were pretreated with anti-IFN-yR Ab , and anti-IFN-y-neutralizing Abs were maintained in the coculture .
Following the treatments , NK cells were removed through Ab panning ; RNA was isolated from the target cells and analyzed for CIITA and HLA-DRa « mRNA expression by RPA ( Fig .
24 ) .
CIITA and HLA-DRa mRNA was absent in control resting cells , except for a trace amount of HLA-DRa in the cell line 2C4 .
As expected , IFN-y significantly up-regulated HLA-DRa and CITA mRNA in HUVECs and 2C4 .
In the GZA and G3A cell lines , there was a small but detectable level of HLA-DRa mRNA induction by IFN-y ; however , this level approximated the level of basal expression in the 2C4 cell line .
A low level of CIITA mRNA was also detected in the cells that were treated with IFN-y .

- Correlation of HLA-DRa and CIITA mRNA induction by IFN-y and NK cell adhesion in HUVECs and IFN-y-signaling mutants .
A , Confluent HUVECs and 2C4 , GZA , and G3A cells that had been pretreated for 20 min with anti-IFN-yR Ab were incubated for 8 h with 100 U/ml of IFN-y or allogeneic NK cells ( 12:1 NK : responder ratio ) that had been pretreated for 35 min with anti-IFN-y-neutralizing Ab .
Following the removal of NK cells through Ab-mediated panning ( see Materials and Meth-ods ) where appropriate , total RNA was isolated from target cells ; 25 ug of this total RNA was analyzed by RPA using probes that were specific for CIITA or HLA-DRa .
B , A total of 1 ug of total RNA from the above experiment was reverse transcribed , and one-twentieth of the reaction mix was analyzed by PCR using primers that were specific for GAPDH , CIITA , HLA-DR « , and CD45 .
PBMC RNA that had been reverse transcribed in a similar fashion was used as a positive control for CD45 .
C , Confluent monolayers of HUVECs were incubated for 16 h with either medium alone , medium containing 100 U/ml of IFN-y , or medium containing 100 U/ml IFN-y that had been pretreated for 1 h with anti-IFN-y-neutralizing Abs .
Total RNA was isolated , and 1 pg of the total RNA was reverse transcribed and analyzed by PCR using primers specific for CHTA and HLA-DRa « .
were treated with NK cells showed a dramatic induction of HLA-DRa mRNA over basal levels .
In the 2C4 , GZA , and G3A cell lines , this increased expression of HLA-DRa was not accompanied by a parallel increase in CIITA mRNA ; no CHITA signal was detectable , even with prolonged exposure .
There is a barely detectable CIITA mRNA band in NK-treated HUVECs that is consistent with previous observations that NK cells have an IFN-y dependent component of MHCII induction ( 12 ) .
However , the induction of HLA-DRa in this sample exceeds that seen for the IFN-y-treated sample , in which there is substantial induction of 1591 CIITA mRNA .
This induction is not due to rapid CIITA mRNA turnover or to unusual kinetics of induction , as no significant CIITA transcript levels were observed over a wide time range ( 1-48 h ) ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that HLA-DRa mRNA can be induced in target cells by NK cells in a manner that is independent of CHITA .
To fully demonstrate the absence of CIITA message in NK cell-induced target cells , the more sensitive but less quantitative RT-PCR method was used .
The results are shown in Figure 2B and confirm the pattern of CIITA and HLA-DRa expression that was seen by RPA .
No CIITA mRNA was detected by PCR in 2C4 , GZA , or G3A that had been treated with NK cells .
PCR using primers that were specific for CD45 was negative , confirming that NK mRNA was absent from the samples .
The IFN-y-independent component of the NK-mediated endothelial class II mRNA induction is variable , as described previously ( 12 ) .
Although HLA-DRa mRNA is induced by NK cells in the absence of CIITA in most experiments , CIITA mRNA is sometimes noted depending upon the NK cell and EC donors , since these experiments are conducted with single-donor cells for both allogeneic NK cells and ECs .
Figure 2C demonstrates that the IFN-y-neutralizing Abs used in the NK cell activation experiments completely inhibit EC CIITA and HLA-DRa mRNA induction by IFN-y as determined by PCR .
Adding dextran sulfate to ECs suppresses the induction of CIITA and MHCII gene expression by IFN-y ( 17 ) .
We are able to reproduce these results and show that NK cells bind to vascular ECs in the presence of dextran sulfate ; in addition , HLA-DRa mRNA is induced ( data not shown ) .
All attempts to detect CIITA mRNA in the mutant cell lines that were cocultured with NK cells have failed , suggesting an alternative mechanism for MHCII gene activation .
We also performed PCR with primers corresponding to nt 235-519 CIITA ( 18 ) to detect CIITA mRNA species that may contain 3 ' truncations .
The experimental results were identical with the PCR analysis using primers corresponding to nt 2881-3351 that is described above .
CIITA mRNA can be induced from multiple promoters depending upon the specific cellular environment ; at least four promoters have been described for human CHITA ( 19 , 20 ) that lead to the expression four cDNAs with distinct 5 ' ends .
The analysis described in this report would detect all four forms of CIITA .
Since it appears that the IFN-y-independent induction of HLA-DRa by NK cells is also independent of CIITA , we investigated other molecules involved in IFN-y signaling .
JAK-1 and JAK-2 associate directly with the IFN-yR ; upon phosphorylation , these kinases are able to phosphorylate and activate STAT-1 « ( reviewed in Ref .
21 ) .
STAT-1 @ then translocates to the nucleus and binds a y-activation sequence ( GAS ) or GAS-like elements in the promoters of IFN-y-activated primary response genes .
At least one of the promoters for CHTA contains a GAS-like element ( 19 , 20 ) .
Suppression of STAT-1 « expression inhibits IFN-y-stimulated CITA mRNA expression ( 8 ) .
Since our coculture experiments used anti-IFN-y and anti-IFN-yR Abs and since CIITA was not induced in target cells that were treated with NK cells , we investigated whether JAK-1 was required .
The U4A cell line ( 22 ) is defective in IFN-y signaling and expresses truncated JAK-1 mRNA and protein ( 23 ) .
We used U4A in our coculture system to determine whether JAK-1 was required to obtain HLA-DRa induction by NK cells .
IFN-y ( 100 U/m ! )
or NK cells ( 5:1 NK : responder ratio ) were added to confluent cultures of the U4A cell line or the parental cell line HT-1080 and incubated for 16 h. Following the removal of NK cells by Ab-mediated panning , target cell RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-PCR ( Fig .
3A ) .
No basal HLA-DRa message was detected in either cell line , but IFN-y was able to induce both CIITA and HLA-DRa message in the parental cell line HT-1080 ; 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 1592 HT1080 U4A 1 ; £5 # 2 z 9 2 guo ﬂifgg ‘ f ‘ ﬁx o % a 23 T2 74 8 F z- ] 400,000 300,000 200,000 100,000 ~ Normalized CPM ( L°T-HGH ) < €4-HT1080 -- - 4-144 - # FIGURE 3 .
Induction of HLA-DRa mRNA and promoter constructs by NK cell adhesion to JAK-1l-deficient cells .
A , Confluent cultures of HT1080 and U4A cells were incubated for 16 h in either medium alone , medium containing 100 U/ml of IFN-y , or medium containing NK cells ( 5:1 NK : responder ratio ) .
NK cells were removed by Ab-mediated panning , and total RNA was isolated from target cells , reverse transcribed , and subjected to PCR using primers specific for GAPDH , CITA , HLA-DRa , and CD45 .
B , HT-1080 and U4A ( 50 % confluent ) cells were transfected with 10 ug each of plasmids -269DR & /HGH and pGL2-luciferase control vector .
After 20 h , cells were treated with medium alone , medium containing 100 U/ml of IFN-y , or medium containing NK cells ( 5:1 NK : responder ratio ) for 48 h. The medium was assayed in duplicate for HGH expression from the -269DR & /HGH construct and was normalized to luciferase activity in cellular extracts .
neither message was detected in the JAK-1-deficient U4A .
However , NK cells induced HLA-DRa mRNA in both the HT-1080 and U4A cell lines ; CIITA message was not detected in either case .
It appears , therefore , that HLA-DRa mRNA can be induced by NK cells in the absence of both CHITA and JAK-1 , which indicates a completely divergent pathway of IFN-y-independent induction of HLA-DRa by NK cells .
To confirm this observation , a HGH construct containing a portion of the HLA-DRa promoter ( -269 HLA-DRa ) was transfected into these cell lines along with a luciferase normalization plasmid ; cells were then activated with either NK cells or IFN-y .
The results are shown in Figure 3B .
In both the HT-1080 and U4A cell lines , there is always substantial basal HGH expression from this promoter construct .
In the HT-1080 cell line , IFN-y and NK cells ( 5:1 NK : responder ratio ) induced the promoter ( 6.2- and 3.6-fold , respectively ) .
However , in the U4A cell line , IFN-y was unable to induce the expression of this promoter construct ; there was a 2.5-fold induction with NK cells .
These results are in agreement with the RT-PCR data shown in Figure 3A .
It is apparent that NK cells induce the expression of HLA-DRa in target cells independently of CHITA using a pathway that is CUTTING EDGE completely divergent from IFN-y induction , since Abs that neutralize IFN-y and also block IFN-yR have no effect , and JAK-1 kinase , which is essential for the IFN-y response , can be circum-vented .
Whether another trans-activating factor is induced by NK cell activation and can act independently of CIITA or whether a more direct signaling event is involved is under investigation .
HLA-DRa mRNA induction is more rapid with NK cell stimulation compared with the induction observed with IFN-y stimulation ( 12 ) .
Perhaps a more direct signaling event is involved , with post-translational modification of a preexisting but as yet unknown fac-tor .
Direct contact through B , integrin/ICAM-1 adhesion is required to achieve IFN-y-independent induction ( 12 ) .
ICAM-1 cross-linking can induce tyrosine phosphorylation events ( 24 , 25 ) and induce MHCII membrane expression on A20 cells ( 26 ) .
NK cells may trigger ICAM-1-mediated signal transduction via adhesion , resulting in HLA-DRa « gene activation .
According to DNA footprinting analysis , the HLA-DRa promoter in the G3 cell line ( CIHITA-defective ) is completely bare ; however , this promoter is partially occupied in the GZA cell line ( K. Wright and J. Ting , personal communication ) .
Efforts are un-derway to compare IFN-y- and NK cell-induced footprints in these mutant cell lines as well as in ECs in an effort to identify distinct regions of the HLA-DRa promoter that is involved in gene activation by NK cells .
CIITA knockout mice express MHCII molecules in the inter-digitating reticular cells of the thymus ( 27 ) .
An isotype-specific activator of HLA-DQ that can act independently of CIITA has been proposed ( 28 , 29 ) .
There is precedent , therefore , for the endogenous expression of MHCII molecules in the absence of CIITA .
Although we describe an IFN-y-independent pathway , accessory pathways of MHCII induction by IFN-y have been described previously ( 30 ) that involve non-Janus protein tyrosine kinases .
Given the easily detectable HLA-DRa gene activation in the U4A cell line , it is possible that NK cell adhesion results in the activation of a similar , non-JAK-mediated kinase pathway .
It is also worth noting that CIITA has a y nt-binding motif that appears to be critical for its function ( 31 ) .
Other GTP-binding proteins may be induced in ECs by lymphocyte adhesion , by replacing CIITA in its protein-protein interaction role , or through other common roles of GTP-binding proteins , including signal transduction and protein transport .
Here , we provide the first evidence that inducible MHCII ( HLA-DR « a ) molecules can be expressed independently of CHITA .
While it is likely that CIITA is required for IFN-y induction of MHCII molecules ( 5 ) , it can no longer be viewed as an essential regulator of MHCII in all cellular contexts .
