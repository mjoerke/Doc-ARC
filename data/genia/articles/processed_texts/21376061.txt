4143-4152 , 2001 The RING finger protein Siah-1 regulates the level of the transcriptional coactivator OBF-1 Ralph Tiedt , Boris A.Bartholdy , Gabriele Matthias , John W.Newell and Patrick Matthias ' Novartis Forschungsstiftung , Zweigniederlassung , Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research , Maulbeerstrasse 66 , 4058 Basel , Switzerland `` Corresponding author e-mail : matthias @ fmi.ch The transcriptional coactivator OBF-1 , which interacts with Oct-1 and Oct-2 and the octamer site DNA , has been shown to be critical for development of a normal immune response and the formation of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs .
Here we have identified the RING finger protein Sigah-1 as a protein interacting specifically with OBF-1 .
This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal part of Sigh-1 and by residues in the N-terminus of OBF-1 , partly distinct from the residues required for formation of a complex with the Oct POU domains and the DNA .
Interaction between Siah-1 and OBF-1 leads to downregulation of OBF-1 protein level but not mRNA , and to a corresponding reduction in octamer site-depend-ent transcription activation .
Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in B cells leads to elevated levels of OBF-1 protein .
Furthermore , in immunized mice , OBF-1 protein amounts are dramatically increased in primary activated B cells , without concomitant increase in OBF-1 mRNA .
These data suggest that Siah-1 is part of a novel regulatory loop controlling the level of OBF-1 protein in B cells .
Keywords : B cell transcription/OBF-1/RING finger proteins/ubiquitin-proteasome pathway Introduction OBF-1 ( also known as Bobl or OCA-B ) is a B-cell-specific transcription coactivator that binds to conserved octamer elements ( ATGCAAAT or reverse ) in the DNA together with the POU domain transcription factors Oct-1 or Oct-2 ( Gstaiger et al .
, 1995 ; Luo and Roeder , 1995 ; Strubin et al .
, 1995 ) .
OBF-1 is a proline-rich protein consisting of an N-terminal part that mediates binding to DNA and Oct factors , and a C-terminal activation domain ( Pfisterer et al .
, 1995 ; Gstaiger et al .
, 1996 ; Luo et al .
, 1998 ) .
In transfection assays as well as in vitro , OBF-1 strongly potentiates transcription from octamer-containing promoters such as the immunoglobulin < light chain promoter ( Luo and Roeder , 1995 ; Strubin et al .
, 1995 ; Schubart et al .
, 1996b ) .
In B cells derived from OBF-1 knockout mice but containing an inducible OBF-1 allele it was found that activity of strictly octamer-dependent reporters was also dependent on OBF-1 ( Laumen et al .
, © European Molecular Biology Organization 2000 ) .
However , gene targeting in mice suggests that one of the major roles of OBF-1 resides in the germinal center reaction during the immune response , which is strongly impaired in OBF -I- mice ( Kim et al .
, 1996 ; Nielsen et al .
, 1996 ; Schubart et al .
, 19962 ) .
In contrast , transcription of octamer-dependent genes at earlier stages of B-cell development , most prominently immunoglobulins , was largely unaffected in these mice ( Schubart et al .
, 2001 ) .
Interestingly , recent structural and functional data have demonstrated that , at least on some of the Ig heavy chain promoters , Oct-1 binds to the octamer site in such a way that OBF-1 can not be recruited to the DNA ( Tomilin et al .
, 2000 ) .
Two recent studies reported that OBF-1 can be specifically upregulated at the level of protein and mRNA when primary splenic B cells are stimulated with either bacterial lipopolysaccharide or a combination of CD40 ligand and interleukin 4 ( IL-4 ) ( Qin et al .
, 1998 ; Greiner et al .
, 2000 ) .
In addition , a strong upregulation of OBF-1 protein was also observed in activated murine splenic B cells after immunization ( Qin et al .
, 1998 ) .
Furthermore , in a variety of human lymphoid tumor samples , OBF-1 was found to be specifically expressed in germinal center-derived tumors ( Greiner et al .
, 2000 ) .
All these findings suggest that OBF-1 is strongly induced during the germinal center reaction .
While this effect seemed to be mainly at the level of transcription in in vitro stimulation experiments ( Qin et al .
, 1998 ) , the mode of regulation in a physiological context has remained unclear .
Here we provide evidence that in vivo this regulation occurs mainly at the post-transcriptional level .
Controlled degradation of proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has recently emerged as a major biological regulatory pathway in eukaryotes ( reviewed in Ciechanover , 1998 ) .
Ubiquitin ligases ( E3s ) play a key role in this process , by interacting with specific proteins and thereby targeting them for degradation .
The RING finger domain is a characteristic feature of a subset of ubiquitin ligases and it interacts with ubiquitin conjugating enzymes ( Lorick et al .
, 1999 ; Freemont , 2000 ; Jackson et al .
, 2000 ; Joazeiro and Weissman , 2000 ) .
The Drosophila RING finger protein Seven in Absentia ( Sina ) has been shown to be critical for development of R7 photoreceptor , through interaction with the protein Tramtrack , a repressor of cell-fate determination ( Li et al .
, 1997 ; Dickson , 1998 ) .
The human homologs Siah-1 and Siah-2 ( Hu et al .
, 1997a ) , and the mouse homologs Siah-1a and -1b and Sigah-2 ( Della et al .
, 1993 ; Holloway et al .
, 1997 ) , are highly conserved , in particular in their C-terminal portion , where they show > 85 % homology .
Recent work has revealed that mammalian Sigh proteins are involved in ubiquitin-mediated degradation of proteins with which they interact , such as DCC ( deleted in colorectal cancer ) and N-CoR , a nuclear 4143 R.Tiedt et al .
receptor corepressor ( Hu et al .
, 1997b ; Zhang et al .
, 1998 ; Hu and Fearon , 1999 ) .
For this process , the RING finger region of Sigh is essential .
Here we identify OBF-1 as a novel interactor of human Siah-1 and show that OBF-1 protein level is downregulated by Siah-1 in a manner that is dependent on this interaction .
Furthermore , we provide evidence that endogenous OBF-1 is degraded in B cell lines via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway .
Taken together with our observation that OBF-1 is post-transcriptionally upregulated during the immune response , these data suggest a novel mechanism of OBF-1 regulation in vivo .
Results Identification of Siah-1 as a protein interacting specifically with OBF-1 We sought to identify proteins that interact specifically with OBF-1 and that might help explain the function and regulation of this factor in B cells .
To this end we set up a yeast two-hybrid screen ( Fields and Song , 1989 ; Gyuris et al .
, 1993 ) with OBF-1 as a bait and screened an activation domain-tagged cDNA library derived from the human B-cell line Namalwa .
Since full-length OBF-1 activates transcription efficiently in yeast when tethered to DNA via the LexA DNA binding domain ( Figure 1 ) , we used the N-terminal portion of OBF-1 ( aa 1-114 ) as a bait , which lacks transcription activation capacity on its own ( Figure 1 ) .
From a screen of ~3 X 10° colonies , four cDNAs were identified that allowed growth of the yeast strain on selective medium .
These cDNAs were found to be independent full-length isolates of Siah-1 , the human homolog of the Drosophila protein Sina .
When re-transformed into the parental yeast strain containing Lex-OBFi_ji4 they all allowed growth on selective medium and also efficiently stimulated expression of a lacZ reporter in an OBF-1-dependent manner ( Figure 1A ) .
To test whether OBF-1 and Sigh-1 can also interact in mammalian cells , a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed .
For this , the Siah-1 cDNA was recloned in a mammalian expression vector so as to express a protein tagged with a myc epitope .
Human 293T cells were transfected with myc-Sigah together with a plasmid encoding a hemagglutinin ( HA ) -tagged version of OBF-1 or , as a control , an HA-tagged Oct-1 POU domain .
Cell extracts were prepared from the transfected cells and OBF-1 or POU-1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody .
The precipitated material was resolved by SDS-PAGE , and subsequently the presence of Siah-1 was detected by western blotting using an anti-myce antibody .
As seen in Figure 1B , immunoprecipitation of OBF-1 , but not of POU-1 , led to co-precipitation of Siah-1 .
This indicates that the two proteins OBF-1 and Siah-1 are also able to interact in mammalian cells , and further indicates that this interaction is specific since no association was detected with the Oct-1 POU domain .
The N-terminal part of OBF-1 interacts with Siah-1 through residues distinct from those mediating interaction with the POU domain To confirm the interaction between OBF-1 and Siah-1 , an in vitro binding assay was used .

The relative B-galactosidase activity of the different strains was normalized for protein level .
( B ) Co-immunoprecipitation assay .
293T cells were transfected with an expression vector for mye-Sigh-1 ( 500 ng or 1 ug ) , together with expression vectors for POU-1-HA or OBF-1-HA , as indicated .
Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were treated for 6 h with 500 nM MG262 in order to stabilize Sigh-1 .
After cell extract preparation , HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 mAb .
The precipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted with the 9E10 mAb to detect potential association of Sigh-1 .
Expression of POU-1 or OBF-1 was detected by reprobing the membrane with the 12CA5 mAb ( lower part ) .
( Figure 2A ) were expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads .
These proteins were then incubated with radiolabeled Siah-1 protein , either full-length or lacking the N-terminal RING finger domain ( SiahAN ) .
After extensive washing , bound protein was separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography .
As shown in Figure 2B , full-length Siah-1 bound efficiently to OBF-1 or to its N-terminal portion ( GST-OBFAC , lane 4 ) , but not to its C-terminus ( GST-OBFAN , lane 5 ) .
When a Siah-1 truncation was used that lacked the first 80 aa including the RING finger ( SiahAN ) , the same binding specificity to OBF-1 was observed , but the binding was somewhat stronger , especially to the N-terminus of OBF-1 ( Figure 2B , lane 9 ) .
To further define the residues within Siah-1 necessary for interaction with OBF-1 , two C-terminal deletions were tested ( Figure 2A ) .

« Wh 10 2 3 4 56 6 7 in Figure 2C , removal of the last 47 aa ( SiahABse , lanes 4-6 ) dramatically reduced binding to full-length OBF-1 ; however , very weak binding to the N-terminus of OBF-1 was still detected ( not shown ) .
Elimination of an additional 25 aa of Siah-1 completely abolished its interaction ( SiahAPvu , lanes 7-9 ) .
Thus , binding to OBF-1 is mediated by residues comprised within the last 72 aa of Siah-1 .
OBF-1 forms a ternary complex with the POU domain of Oct-1 or Oct-2 , and the octamer DNA .
Based on mutagenesis as well as crystallographic studies , a minimal domain has been defined in the N-terminal moiety of OBF-1 , which encompasses residues 1-44 and which is RING finger protein Siah-1 regulates OBF-1 level o & é ‘ E'éb ’ ﬁscffoépiﬁ & & i193 . ``

OBF-1 and Sigh-1 interact in vitro .
( A ) Schematic representation of the cDNAs used in this study .
Depending on the experiment and as indicated in the relevant figure legends , the different proteins were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins , made in reticulocyte lysate or expressed in eukaryotic cells from an appropriate expression vector , For OBF-1 , the open rectangle represents the region that is necessary for interaction with the POU domain and DNA ( Gstaiger et al .
, 1996 ; Chasman et al .
, 1999 ) .
( B-D ) In vitro pull-down assays .
Equal amounts of GST-OBF-1 fusion proteins as indicated were incubated with *°S-labeled Sigh-1 proteins .
After extensive washing , radioactive protein that was retained was visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography .
( E ) Equal amounts of extracts from 293T cells transiently transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged Sigh-1 , SiahAN or SighABse were incubated with beads loaded with GST-OBF-1 fusion proteins , as indicated .
After extensive washing , bound proteins were run on SDS-PAGE and retained Sigh was detected by western blotting using an anti-HA antibody .
( F ) Extracts from 293T cells transfected with Myc-tagged OBF-1 constructs as indicated were incubated with GST alone or GST-SiahAN on glutathione beads .
Subsequent analysis was carried out as in ( E ) .
necessary for specific interaction with the POU domain and DNA ( Gstaiger et al .
, 1996 ; Chasman et al .
, 1999 ) .
Since Siah-1 was also found to interact with the N-terminal half of OBF-1 , it was of interest to determine whether the same OBF-1 residues might be involved in the two types of interaction .
To investigate this , deletions as well as point mutants of OBF-1 were made .
As shown in Figure 2D , GST fusion proteins lacking either residues 1-45 or residues 46-91 of OBF-1 failed to interact with radiolabeled in vitro translated SiahAN .
Similar results were obtained with Siah-1 full-length ( data not shown ) .
To verify these results we next used an alternative binding assay , in which the GST-OBF fusion proteins were 4145 R.Tiedt et al .
incubated with extracts from transiently transfected 293T cells expressing different forms of Sigh proteins .
In several instances we have found this assay to be more stringent and to give cleaner results .
In this case , as shown in Figure 26 , no significant binding was observed between OBFAI-45 or OBFA46-91 , and Siah-1 or SiahAN .
Together these results therefore suggest that the region of OBF-1 required for interaction with Siah-1 is partly overlapping with the region needed for formation of a Amy'GOBF-I-++++-++++ HASich 1 ___ mill HA-SighAN protein : OBF-1 - » © 0 ell s Sigh-1 - ae __ __ < - SiahAN TBP -~ 1 2 3 4 § 8 7 8 9 10 RNA : OBF-1 - » = =*=== B-mcctien - » - Wl hoe dut woes pout Sith Mah M Ah tag 1 2 3 4 50 6 7 a a 10 B s 8 £16555 ?

This analysis was extended by testing the binding capacity of two previously characterized OBF-1 point mutants , OBF-L32P and OBF-V51E ( Gstaiger et al .
, 1996 ) .
The mutant protein OBF-L32P has been shown to have a weakened interaction with the POU domain and consequently a poor transcription activation capacity ( Gstaiger et al .
, 1996 ) .
Crystallographic studies have revealed that residue L32 of OBF-1 is in direct contact with the POU-specific domain of Oct-1 ( Chasman et al .
, 1999 ) ; however , this mutant is bound in vitro by SiahAN like wild-type ( WT ) OBF-1 ( Figure 2F ; see also Figure 5C ) .
In contrast , the OBF-1 mutant V51E has been found earlier to still interact efficiently with the Oct-1 POU domain , and to activate transcription like WT ( Gstaiger et al .
, 1996 ) .
In the crystal structure , this residue is not in contact with the POU domain .
As shown here , however , this mutant is strongly impaired in its interaction with Siah-1 ( Figure 2F , lane 9 ) .
Together , these results show that the regions of OBF-1 required for interaction with Siah-1 and the Oct POU domain are overlapping , but distinct contacts are made .
OBF-1 protein level is specifically downregulated through interaction with Siah-1 Siah-1 has been shown to specifically mediate degradation of DCC ( Hu et al .
, 1997b ; Hu and Fearon , 1999 ) , NCoR ( Zhang et al .
, 1998 ) , Kid ( Germani et al .
, 2000 ) and Bag-1 ( Sourisseau et al .
, 2001 ) .
We therefore tested whether the interaction identified here might regulate OBF-1 expression , perhaps by promoting its degradation .
For this , 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for OBF-1 in the absence or presence of a Siah-1 expression vector , and 2 days later the levels of the different proteins were Fig .

Interaction between Sigh-1 and OBF-1 reduces OBF-1 protein expression .
( A ) 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged Sigh-1 or Sigh-AN , and Myc-tagged OBF-1 , as indicated .
Control transfections in lanes 1 and 6 contained empty expression vectors .
Protein extracts and RNA were prepared and equal amounts were analyzed by western ( upper panels ) or northern blotting ( lower panels ) .
OBF-1 and Sigh proteins were detected with monoclonal antibodies directed against the respective tags ( anti-Myc , 9E10 ; anti-HA , 12CA5 ) .
As a control for endogenous protein , TBP was detected with the specific monoclonal antibody $ SL-39 .
For the experiment shown on the right of the figure , less OBF-1 expression vector was used , explaining the weaker signal for OBF-1 protein and RNA .
( B ) Cells were transfected with Myc-tagged OBF-1 ( lanes 1-5 ) and WT or point mutated Sigh ( HA-tagged at the N-terminus ) , as indicated .
After protein extract preparation , the respective proteins were detected as described above .
Because the Sigh-1 point mutant was expressed at a much higher level than WT Sigh-1 , less expression vector was used for the transfection .
( C ) Cells were transfected with Myc-tagged OBF-1 ( lanes 1-9 ) and the indicated HA-Sigh expression plasmids .
OBF-1 and Sigh proteins were detected as in ( A ) .
The band of equal intensity visible across the lower part of the picture corresponds to an endogenous protein cross-reacting with the anti-HA antibody .
( D ) Cells were transfected with Myc-tagged expression vectors for WT OBF-1 or the two point mutants indicated , together with a plasmid expressing Sigh-1 ( lanes 2 , 4 and 6 ) .
Protein extracts were prepared and OBF-1 protein was detected by western blotting as above .
( E ) Cells were transfected with Myc-tagged expression vectors for WT OBF-1 or the two deletion mutants indicated , together with a plasmid expressing Sigh-1 or SiahABse .
The level of OBF-1 expression was monitored by western blotting , as above .
examined by western blotting .
As seen in Figure 3A , addition of increasing amounts of the Siah-1 expression vector led to a dose-dependent reduction of OBF-1 protein ( lanes 3-5 ) .
Siagh-1 itself is degraded through the proteasome in a RING finger-dependent manner ( Hu and Fearon , 1999 ) and was expressed only at low level .
When SiahAN was used , however , no reduction in OBF-1 level was observed and the amount of OBF-1 was in fact reproducibly increased ( lanes 8-10 ) .
This may reflect competition between transfected SiahAN and endogenous Siah-1 protein , leading to protection of OBF-1 from degradation .
In addition , SiahAN was expressed at much higher levels than WT Sigh , consistent with the fact that the former protein is no longer degraded through the proteasome ( Hu and Fearon , 1999 ) .
In contrast , the presence of or SiahAN had no impact on the amount of TATA binding protein ( TBP ) , indicating that this effect is specific for OBF-1 .
Importantly , there was no influence of Siah-1 or SiahAN on the amount of OBF-1 mRNA expressed from the transfected plasmid ( Figure 3A ) .
The function of the RING finger has been shown to depend on several conserved cysteine residues ( Freemont , 2000 ; Jackson et al .
, 2000 ; Joazeiro and Weissman , 2000 ) .
To confirm the importance of the RING finger of Siah-1 for downregulating OBF-1 expression , we generated cysteine-to-serine point mutants in the Siah-1 RING finger ( Hu and Fearon , 1999 ) and tested them in the transfection assay described above .
As seen in Figure 3B , while WT Siah-1 downregulated OBF-1 efficiently , the point mutants Siah-C558 and the double mutant Siah-C62S/ C65S all failed to degrade OBF-1 .
As expected , these three point mutants were expressed at significantly higher levels , since they are no longer degraded by the proteasome .
We next examined whether downregulation of OBF-1 expression indeed required a direct interaction with Siah-1 .
For this , we used the C-terminally truncated Sigh proteins SiahABse and SiahAPvu , which , as we have shown above , are no longer able to interact with OBF-1 ( Figure 2C ) .
As shown in Figure 3C , SiahABse and SiahAPvu both failed to downregulate OBF-1 expression ; however , these two Siah-1 mutants are still degraded normally through the proteasome pathway and can be stabilized efficiently by proteasome inhibitors ( data not shown and see below ) .
Finally , the point mutated protein OBF-V51E , which no longer interacts with Sigh in vitro ( Figure 2F ) , was also not subject to downregulation by Sigah-1 in vivo , whereas OBF-L32P was still efficiently downregulated ( Figure 3D ) .
Likewise , the two deletion mutants OBFA1I-45 and OBFA4G6-91 were both resistant to downregulation by Siagh-1 ( Figure 3E ) .
Together , these results show that OBF-1 expression is regulated by Siah-1 in a manner requiring specific interaction between these two proteins .
Inhibition of the proteasome can rescue Siah-1-mediated downregulation of OBF-1 protein expression To test whether reduction in OBF-1 expression requires the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway , transiently transfected cells were treated with the highly specific proteasome inhibitor MG262 ( McCormack et al .

Sigh-1 promotes OBF-1 degradation by the proteasome .
L929 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged OBF-1 and HA-tagged Siah-1 expression vectors , as indicated .
After treatment for 12 h with the proteasome inhibitor MG262 , or with H ; O as control , extracts were prepared and proteins detected by western blotting .
1997 ) .
As shown in Figure 4 , addition of 500 nM MG262 for 12 h rescued almost completely the downregulation of OBF-1 by Siah-1 , suggesting that Siah-1 indeed mediates proteasomal degradation of OBF-1 .
Under these condi-tions , Siah-1 , which is normally expressed only at very low levels , owing to constant degradation , was found to be stabilized efficiently and no effect was observed on the TBP level .
Perhaps surprisingly , MG262 was found to modestly increase the amount of OBF-1 even in the absence of transfected Siah-1 ( Figure 4 , lane 3 ) .
This effect might be explained by 'basal ' degradation of OBF-1 through endogenous Siah-1 protein in the absence of proteasome inhibitor .
This observation is also in good agreement with the results obtained with Sigh AN , in the presence of which an upregulation of OBF-1 was observed ( see Figure 3A ) .
Siah-1 specifically antagonizes transcription activation mediated by OBF-1 The interaction identified here between Siah-1 and the transcriptional coactivator OBF-1 suggested that in vivo OBF-1-dependent transcription might be modulated by Siah-1 .
To test this , we set up reporter assays in which a luciferase gene under the control of an octamer site-containing promoter was transfected into 293T cells , together with the expression vectors indicated in Figure 5 .
When increasing amounts of Siah-1 expression vector were included in the transfection , a dose-dependent decrease was observed in OBF-1-stimulated luciferase activity ( Figure 5A , lanes 2-4 , black bars ) .
This effect was dependent specifically on OBF-1 , since in its absence Siah-1 did not repress the basal level of luciferase expression ( lanes 2-4 , gray bars ) .
The same effect was also observed on several other octamer site-containing promoters ( data not shown ) , and Siah-1 cotransfection did not repress a luciferase reporter under the control of the proximal thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter , which does not contain an octamer site ( Figure 5B ) .
Inhibition of OBF-1-mediated transcription activation was specifically dependent on its interaction with Siah-1 as well as on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway , since SiahABse , SiahAPvu and SiahAN did not have any repressive effect ( data not shown ) .
The two OBF-1 point mutants mentioned above also behaved in a manner expected from their binding behavior ; OBF-L32ZP is impaired in interaction with the Oct-1 POU domain and therefore poorly activates transcription .
However , this 4147 R.Tiedt et al .

Sigh-1 antagonizes transcription activation mediated by OBF-1 .
( A ) 293T cells were transiently transfected with 500 ng of the reporter pKLucE , together with an HA-Sigh-1 expression vector in increasing amounts ( lanes 1-4 ; 0 , 100 , 250 and 500 ng , respectively ; filled up to 500 ng with empty vector ) .
This was done without ( gray bars ) or with ( black bars ) 500 ng of a Myc-OBF-1 expression vector and the first value ( lane 1 , without Sigh ) of each series was set to 1 .
When looking at absolute values , OBF-1 stimulated the reporter activity > 50-fold ( not shown ) .
( B ) Cells were transfected with the reporter pTK-Luc and with a Sigh-1 expression vector as in ( A ) .
( C ) Cells were transfected with the reporter pKLucE and Myc-OBF-1 WT , L32P or V51E , together with an empty expression vector ( gray bars ) or an HA-Sigh-1 expression vector ( black bars ) .
The data represent the average of three independent experiments , and each value was measured in duplicate .
Values were normalized to the protein concentration of each sample , determined by the Bradford method .
mutant interacted well with Siah-1 , with the consequence that transcription activation was antagonized by Siah-1 , as seen in Figure 5C .
In contrast , OBF-V51E activates transcription efficiently , but was not targeted for degradation by Siah-1 .
Accordingly , transcription activation by this mutant was only little affected by Siah-1 .
Thus , Siah-1 specifically antagonizes transcription activation by OBF-1 through promoting its degradation .
In B cells , endogenous OBF-1 protein is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway The data presented so far demonstrate that Siah-1 and OBF-1 interact specifically and that this interaction results 4148 HAFTL1 0 1 2 3 4 § 0 1 2 3 4 5 Time ( h ) OBF-1 -£ < e wag =o -~ « oute dth mem : cuase woes .

To test whether in B cells OBF-1 protein levels might indeed be controlled through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway , we measured the amount of OBF-1 protein present in several B-cell lines after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( Palombella et al .
, 1994 ; Rock et al .
, 1994 ) .
For these experiments cells were treated with cycloheximide in order to inhibit protein synthesis .
As shown in Figure 6 , in the mouse B-cell lines HAFTL-1sc1 and $ 194 the amount of endogenous OBF-1 decreased rapidly when protein synthesis was blocked ( left half ) , showing a half-life of ~2 h. However , when the proteasome inhibitor was added , a rescue of OBF-1 level was obtained ( right half ) .
In contrast , under the same conditions TBP was found to be stable and was not affected by inhibition of the proteasome .
Similar results were also obtained in the B-cell line P3X63-Ag8.653 ( not shown ) .
Together , these data show that endogenous OBF-1 is subject to degradation through the proteasome pathway , which is likely to involve Siah-1 .
In activated primary B cells OBF-1 is upregulated post-transcriptionally , consistent with a role for Siah-1 Previous work has shown that in splenic B cells OBF-1 expression can be induced , both at the RNA and protein level , by stimulation with LPS or CD4O0/IL-4 ( Qin et al .
, 1998 ; Greiner et al .
, 2000 ) .
It has also been found that OBF-1 protein levels are particularly high in germinal center ( GC ) B cells , where OBF-1 plays a critical role ( Qin et al .
, 1998 ; Greiner et al .
, 2000 ) .
Here we sought to determine whether the dramatic upregulation of OBF-1 protein observed in GC B cells is controlled at the level of transcription or whether it reflects a post-transcriptional regulation mechanism .

In activated primary B cells , OBF-1 protein levels are elevated at the post-transcriptional level .
Mice ( C57B16 ) were immunized with 150 ug of DNP-KLH adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide , and 10 days later splenic B cells were isolated and centrifuged over Percoll step gradients .
High density ( HD ) and low density ( LD ) B cells were isolated , and protein and RNA prepared simultaneously .
Levels of OBF-1 protein were determined by western blot analysis with an anti-OBF-1 antibody .
OBF-1 RNA was measured by northern blotting , also using a probe for B-actin as control .
The level of Sigh-1 RNA was determined by RNase protection assay , using a probe for the ribosomal protein $ 16 as control .
A control hybridization with yeast RNA is also shown .
In the lower part , a Phosphorimager quantification of these data is presented , using the level of $ 16 RNA for normalization .
For this , mice were immunized with DNP-KLH and 10 days later splenic B cells were isolated and separated by centrifugation into high density and low density B cells , the latter corresponding mostly to activated GC cells ( Thompson et al .
, 1984 ) .
In these two B-cell fractions the levels of OBF-1 protein and RNA were examined and correlated to the level of Siah-1 RNA , since no antibody against Siah was available .
As shown in Figure 7 , the amount of OBF-1 protein was dramatically increased in low density B cells , consistent with the reported upregulation of this factor in GC B cells .
Strikingly , however , the amount of OBF-1 mRNA was unchanged , or even slightly less in the low density fraction , indicating that this upregulation takes place almost entirely at the post-transcriptional level .
Furthermore , the level of Siah-1 mRNA was found to be moderately , but significantly , decreased in activated ( Jow density ) B cells , as would be expected if downregulation of Siah-1 were part of the mechanism controlling the amount of OBF-1 in GC B cells .
Discussion Siah-1 , a novel partner of OBF-1 Here we have identified the RING finger protein Siah-1 as a binding partner for the B-cell-specific transcriptional coactivator OBF-1 .
Using the N-terminal half of OBF-1 as a bait to screen a B-cell-derived cDNA library , several independent isolates of Siah-1 were obtained and specific RING finger protein Siah-1 regulates OBF-1 level interaction between these two proteins was confirmed in vitro and in vivo .
We found that in transfected cells the Siah-OBF-1 interaction leads to downregulation of OBF-1 expression at the protein level and a concomitant decrease in transcription activation of octamer site-containing reporter plasmids .
OBF-1 downregulation was dependent on interactions between the two proteins , and required an intact RING finger within Siah-1 .
Furthermore , it could be prevented to a large extent by inhibition of the proteasome , consistent with the known mode of action of RING finger proteins .
The significant but not complete rescue by proteasome inhibition may suggest that part of the downregulation observed here is independent of the proteasome .
Precisely this was found to be the case for the observed inhibition of the Vav pathway by Siah-2 ( Germani et al .
, 1999 ) ; yet treatment of several B-cell lines with a proteasome inhibitor resulted in elevated OBF-1 protein levels , indicating that in B cells OBF-1 turnover indeed involves degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway .
Finally , we found that in primary activated B cells , the OBF-1 protein is dramatically upregulated , however without increase in RNA level .
Given the high conservation between Siah-1 ( in the mouse , Siah-la and -1b ) and Siah-2 , it appears likely that Siah-2 is also able to interact with OBF-1 and in fact such an interaction has been shown ( T.Wirth , personal communication ) .
Siah genes are expressed in a broad range of organs and cells ( Della et al .
, 1993 ) , and from RT-PCR analysis , mouse Siah-1a , the homolog of the protein we identified , appears to be the most expressed Siah family member in murine splenic B cells ( data not shown ) .
Structural aspects of the interaction between Siah-1 and OBF-1 Previous work has shown that OBF-1 makes a ternary complex with the POU domain of Oct-1 and Oct-2 and the octamer site DNA .
Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrated that OBF-1 interacts with both moieties of the POU domain , the POUs and the POUy subdomains , as well as with the DNA ( Babb et al .
, 1997 ; Sauter and Matthias , 1998 ) .
These multiple interactions may lead to stabilization of the Oct protein on its cognate site .
A recent crystal structure of the Oct-1 POU domain in complex with the octamer site and a peptide comprising residues 1-44 of OBF-1 has confirmed these observations and defined the direct contacts between OBF-1 and residues in the POUs and POUy subdomains and in the DNA ( Chasman et al .
, 1999 ) .
Interestingly , the novel interaction identified here with Siah-1 also takes place through amino acids located in the N-terminus of OBF-1 , in a region that is broadly overlapping with the segment required for binding to the POU domain .
Two deletion mutants of OBF-1 , lacking residues 1-45 or 46-91 , respectively , both failed to interact with Sigh-1 in vitro ( Figure 2D and E ; or in vivo , data not shown ) .
In addition , two OBF-1 point mutants gave additional useful information : OBF-L32P , which fails to interact efficiently with the POU domain ( Gstaiger et al .
, 1996 ) , still bound well to Siah-1 .
On the contrary , OBF-V51E , which does not impair interaction with Oct proteins , disrupted binding to Siah-1 .
Thus , the regions required for interaction with Oct and Siah-1 are overlapping , but distinct contacts are made .
It remains to be determined whether , for example , Siah-1 may be able to 4149 R.Tiedt et al .
bind to OBF-1 complexed with the POU domain and the DNA , and if so , whether it might also indirectly target the Oct factors for degradation .
In Siah-1 , residues within the C-terminal 72 amino acids are necessary for binding to OBF-1 .
Although the precise Siah amino acids involved in interaction have not been defined in any of the published studies , in each case ( N-CoR , DCC or the kinesin Kid ) the interaction involved the C-terminal half of Sigh ( Hu et al .
, 1997b ; Germani et al .
, 2000 ) .
The binding of Siah-1 to OBF-1 identifies a novel regulatory mechanism operating in B cells One of the most striking defects in OBF-1-deficient mice is their dramatically reduced immune response accompanied by a total absence of germinal center development .
Thus , in the absence of OBF-1 a very late stage of B-cell maturation is affected , which takes place in secondary lymphoid organs in response to external stimuli , in particular CD40 signaling .
This late phenotype had been somewhat unexpected because OBF-1 expression at the RNA level had been found to be rather constant in B-cell lines representing different stages of B-cell differentiation .
A partial explanation came from the realization that the OBF-1 protein is upregulated in GC B cells ( Qin et al .
, 1998 ) or in cell lines derived thereof ( Greiner et al .
, 2000 ) , and that in purified splenic B cells , treated in vitro with CD40L and IL-4 or CD4OL and anti-IgM , OBF-1 mRNA and protein expression can be induced ( Qin et al .
, 1998 ; our unpublished results ) .
Because CD40 signaling is essential for the development of GCs , it has been assumed that upregulation of OBF-1 RNA expression by CD4O0L leads to the increased OBF-1 protein amount observed in GC cells ( Qin et al .
, 1998 ) .
Here we found that in primary activated B cells that had been stimulated in vivo ( i.e .
in cells isolated from immunized mice ) there is indeed a dramatic upregulation of OBF-1 protein , but there is no increase in OBF-1 RNA ( Figure 7 ) .
Thus , the upregulation of OBF-1 protein level observed in vivo must take place , largely if not exclusively , at the post-transcriptional level .
The identification of an interaction between OBF-1 and a RING finger protein known to target other proteins to proteasomal degradation offers an attractive solution to this paradox .
A central tenet of the model proposed here is that Siah protein level ( or activity ) becomes downregulated as cells are activated in vivo .
Since antibodies against Siah-1 were not available , we could not directly test the hypothesis that downregulation of Siah-1 protein level correlates with the upregulation of OBF-1 observed in GC cells .
However , analysis of Siah-1 RNA showed that its level decreases moderately upon in vivo B-cell activation , in good agreement with the proposed model .
In addition , in B cells stimulated in vitro with anti-CD40 or anti-CD40 and IL-4 the Sigh-1 mRNA level was found to decrease moderately ( data not shown ) .
In transfected cells we have observed that small differences in the respective amounts of Siah-1 and OBF-1 can have important consequences regarding the magnitude of OBF-1 protein downregulation .
Therefore , it seems reasonable to assume that in B cells , even relatively subtle changes in the amounts ( or activity ) of Siah-1 may lead to rather large differences in OBF-1 protein levels .
Furthermore , in multiple instances it has been shown that degradation of proteins by the proteasome is ultim- 4150 ately modulated by post-translational modification , such as phosphorylation , either of the target protein itself or of the RING finger protein .
For example , the tumor suppressor protein p53 is normally degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway , and for this , interaction with the RING finger protein MDM2 is critical .
In response to DNA damage , p53 becomes phosphorylated by the kinase Chk2 on Ser20 ; this then leads to disruption of the p53-MDM2 interaction and p53 stabilization ( Caspari , 2000 ) .
In this respect it is worth mentioning that OBF-1 has been found to be phosphorylated in its C-terminal portion ( Zwilling et al .
, 1997 ) .
Mutation of the previously described phosphorylation site $ 184 to either A , D or E , however , had no impact on OBF-1 downregulation in transfection assays ( data not shown ) .
Finally , our finding that treatment of several B-cell lines with a proteasome inhibitor leads to a significant upregulation of OBF-1 protein lends additional support to the notion that in vivo OBF-1 is , at least partly , regulated at the post-transcriptional level .
Materials and methods Yeast two-hybrid screen The yeast two-hybrid screen ( Fields and Song , 1989 ) in this study was conducted using the 'interaction trap ' version ( Gyuris et al .
, 1993 ) .
In brief , the yeast strain EGY48 , which contains a LEU2 gene under the transcriptional control of multimerized lexA operator elements , was transformed with a bait vector expressing a fusion of lexA and the first 114 aa of human OBF-1 , and with a library derived from the human B-cell line Namalwa , which expressed the containing cDNAs as fusions to the VP16 activation domain ( Strubin et al .
, 1995 ) .
Primary transformants ( 3 X 106 ) were screened on medium lacking leucine , and from this Sigh-1 was isolated independently four times .
To confirm interaction in yeast , a second lexA-dependent reporter bearing a lacZ gene was transfomed together with the respective expression plasmids , and B-galactosidase activity was measured by standard protocols .
Bacterial and in vitro protein expression To generate GST fusion proteins , the relevant DNA fragments were cloned into pGex2T ( Pharmacia ) and transformed into the bacterial strains BL21 or TOPP ( Stratagene ) .
Bacteria were grown at room temperature and induced for 2 h with 0.4 mM before lysis .
Lysates were prepared by treatment with lysozyme and repeated freeze and thaw followed by ultracentrifugation to remove cell debris .
GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads .
In vitro translation was performed with clones in the plasmid pBGO-ATG using the 'TnT ' system ( Promega ) .

After western blotting as above , endogenous OBF-1 was detected using a polyclonal antibody that was raised in rabbits against the C-terminal 154 amino acids of murine OBF-1 .
To measure luciferase activity , reporter plasmids were cotransfected as indicated in Figure 5 , and cell lysates generated as described above were measured according to standard protocols .
Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays For co-immunoprecipitation , HEK 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method in 60-mm dishes with the constructs indicated in Figure 1B .
After 48 and 6 h treatment with MG262 , cells were lysed as described above and ~500 ug of extract were incubated for 1 h on ice with 100 ul of 12CAS5 hybridoma supernatant in 1 ml of IP buffer .
After this , 20 pul of protein A-Sepharose slurry were added and samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation .
Beads were washed three times with IP buffer and subsequently resuspended and boiled in 20 ul of loading buffer for SDS-PAGE .
IP buffer was 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 , 0.5 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl and 0.1 % Triton X-100 .
For the in vitro binding assay , GST fusion proteins on glutathione beads were incubated with either in vitro translated radiolabeled protein or with extract from transfected cells .
The binding and washing of the beads was done in 100 mM NaCl , 40 mM HEPES pH 7.9 , 5 mM MgCl , 0.5 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride and 0.05 % NP-40 .
Washed beads were boiled in loading buffer and bound proteins were run on denaturing gels followed by either autoradiography or western blotting .
Generally , in lanes labeled 'input ' 1/10 of the material used for the binding reaction was loaded .
Northern blotting RNA was prepared by Trizol ( Gibco ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Total RNA ( 15 ug ) was analyzed by northern blotting as described in Qiagen News ( Issue 2/3 , 2000 ) using Hybond-XL membranes ( Amersham Pharmacia ) .
OBF-1 was visualized with a radiolabeled coding region probe .
Proteasome inhibitor and cycloheximide treatment For L929 cells , the highly potent proteasome inhibitor MG262 ( Affiniti ; McCormack et al .
, 1997 ) was used at a concentration of 500 nM and treatment lasted 12 h , unless indicated otherwise .
B cells were treated with 25 M proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( Sigma ; Palombella et al .

, 1994 ) and 20 jig/ml cycloheximide for the times indicated in the respective figure .
Immunization and splenic cell fractionation Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 ug of aluminium hydroxide-adsorbed DNP-KLH .
After 10 days , mice were killed , splenic cells were isolated and depleted for T cells by magnetic beads coupled to the pan-T-cell marker Thy1.2 ( Dynal ) .
The remaining cells ( mainly B cells ) were separated into high density ( largely resting ) and low density ( largely activated ) B cells by Percoll gradient centrifugation as described in Coligan ( 1992 ) .
Protein and RNA were prepared as described above .
RNase protection assay RNase protection was carried out as described earlier ( Schubart et al .
, 1996b ) .
In brief , a probe was in vitro transcribed from an IMAGE clone ( clone ID 523455 ) that contained part of the murine Sigh-1A cDNA .
The gel-purified radiolabeled probe was afterwards hybridized with 20 ug of total RNA at 50°C over night .
After RNase digestion , RNA was resolved RING finger protein Siah-1 regulates OBF-1 level on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed .
The protected part of the murine Siah-1A cDNA covered the region from approximately position +90 to +370 to give a band of 280 bases .
