fibroblasts ) .
We have recently characterised a new factor called IK which is an efficient inhibitor of IFN-y induction of MHC class II antigens expression .
Here , we demonstrate a novel role for IK in MHC class II expression since over-expression of this protein by stable transfection into human B cells led to a total disappearance of constitutive MHC class II mRNA expression .
The class II transactivator ( CIITA ) is necessary for both constitutive and IFN-y induced MHC class II expressions .
Examination of CIITA mRNA in IK stably transfected clones revealed a marked reduction of CIITA mRNA - transcription .
- Taken together these results demonstrate that the IK protein plays a key role in the constitutive expression of MHC class II antigens and that inhibition induced by IK is upstream of CIITA in this regulatory pathway .
Keywords : MHC class II ; IK ; CIITA ; IFN-y Introduction Major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens ( HLA-DR , DP or DQ ) play a key role in the initiation , the development and the regulation of the immune response .
These surface molecules are constitutively expressed on a restricted number of cells named antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) which including B lymphocytes , macrophages or dendritic cells ( reviewed by Benoist and Mathis , 1990 ; Glimcher and Kara , 1992 ; Ting and Baldwin , 1993 ) .
The regulation of this constitutive expression is also a crucial point in both the ontogeny and the APC function of B cells .
MHC class II antigens are expressed on circulating B lymphocytes but are absent from differentiated plasmocytes ( reviewed by Glimcher and Kara , 1992 ) .
Type II bare lymphocyte syndromes ( BLS II ) are characterised by a lack of constitutive MHC class II expression on B lymphocytes resulting in a severe hereditary immunodeficiency ( de Preval et al .
, 1988 ; Griscelli et al .
, 1989 ; Touraine et al .
, 1985 ; Mach et al .
, 1994 ) .
Considering the restoration of HLA-DR membrane expression after cell fusion experiments , Correspondence : J Vedrenne Received 24 June 1996 ; revised 22 October 1996 ; accepted 19 November 1996 four genetic complementation groups ( A , B , C and D ) were defined ( Bénichou and Strominger , 1991 ) .
A partial deletion of the MHC class II transactivator ( CIITA ) gene has been defined as the cause of the negative phenotype observed in the group A .
On the other hand , a wide range of cell lines express MHC class II antigens on their surface under exogenous cytokine stimulation .
Steimle et al .
( 1994 ) have described that IFN-y induced MHC class II antigens expression is preceded by a positive regulation of CIITA gene expression .
This finding provides a new element in similarity between constitutive and inducible MHC class II regulation pathways .
In the case of several cell lines , we have demonstrated that the induction of MHC class II surface expression could only be obtained in conditions of high IFN-y concentration and low cellular density ( Krief et al .
, 1987 ) .
These observations have led us to characterise and to purify a new protein called IK ( Inhibitor K562 ) , originally described as a specific secreted inhibitor of IFN-y induced MHC class II antigen expression ( Krief et al .
, 1994 ) .
We report here that this molecule is differentially expressed in B lymphocytes and that IK expression is inversely correlated with HLA-DR expression .
Given the role of CIITA in both constitutive and inducible MHC class II regulation we have therefore investigated the possible role of IK in constitutive MHC class II regulation .
Over-expression of exogenous IK mRNA in transfected B lymphoblasts ( Raji ) cells induces a decrease of constitutive HLA-DR transcription .
These results clearly suggest an inhibitory effect of the IK protein on the constitutive HLA-DR-z expression .
By highly sensitive RT - PCR analysis we show that the CIITA mRNA level is almost negligible in these MHC class II negative transfected Raji cells .
It therefore appears that the IK protein acts through a negative regulation of CIITA expression .
Furthermore , used RT - PCR to demonstrate the lack of modulation of the IK mRNA level after CIITA transfection into class II negative RJ 2.2.5 cells , suggesting that the regulation of IK protein expression is not directly driven by CIITA factor .
Results IK mRNA expression levels We have established the level of endogenous IK mRNA by Northern blot analysis on poly ( A ) * RNA extracted from Raji and RJ 2.2.5 cells ( Figure 1 ) before carrying out transfection assays .
Endogenous mRNA encoding the IK protein ( 2.1 kb ) is not detected in Raji IK inhibits HLA class II constitutive expression J Vedrenne et al 1454 cells .
In contrast IK is clearly expressed in RJ 2.2.5 cells .
Highly sensitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) method was used in order to demonstrate the difference in IK mRNA expression between these two cell lines .
Interestingly , IK specific mRNA was also detected by RT - PCR in the Raji cell line .
This more sensitive revelation allowed us to quantify the signal relative to the specific GAPDH signal intensity ( Figures 2 and 3A ) .
We established here that IK protein mRNA is much more highly expressed ( close to 10 times ) in the MHC class II negative mutant RJ 2.2.5 than in the parental MHC class II positive Raji cells .
We therefore demonstrate a new difference in mRNA expression pattern between two B cell lines previously defined according to their MHC class II antigens and CIITA expression levels .

An internal control of mRNA quality and quantity is provided by the hybridization with a specific probe of the GAPDH gene class II expression is , as previously described , very high on Raji cells but negative on RJ 2.2.5 cells ( Accolla , 1983 ) .
To examine whether IK protein was involved in the regulation of constitutive MHC class II antigen expression we have carried out stable co-transfection of Raji with both the expressing vector encoding IK protein and the pHyg selection plasmid .
We have obtained 70 stably transfected clones ( Table 1 ) .
Exogenous IK mRNA expression was detected by RT/PCR ( Figure 3B ) .
One of the primers used is localised in the plasmid sequence in order to avoid the detection of endogenous IK mRNA .
This study shows that only 16 resistant clones express the exogenous IK mRNA .
This data represents approximately an efficiency of 22 % in the co-transfection assay .
On the other hand , 54 ( 78 % ) clones remained negative for this mRNA expression .
Absence of cDNA amplification is occurred when there was only the single integration of the pHyg plasmid .
The expression of IK mRNA was also detected and evaluated by RT-PCR as previously described ( Figure 3C ) .
As expected , the IK typical RT - PCR product is clearly more expressed in the positively transfected Raji cells ( Figure 3D ) .
These transfected cells provide a cellular model in which B cells are separated on the basis of their IK mRNA expression level .
No amplification was observed with cDNA obtained from empty pCDMB8-transfected Raji cells ( data not shown ) , thereby confirming the specificity of the RT - PCR detection .

This analysis is representative of the 70 stably transfected clones expression .
Stable transfection of IK-antisenses cDNA in previously IK-transfected Raji cells gave the following results : a partial recovery of HLA-DR- « mRNA expression was detected by RT - PCR after IK -antisenses transfection ( Figure 5B ) .
Twenty clones were obtained and five of them were tested for the HLA-DR- « mRNA expression .
A weak HLA-DR- « specific RT - PCR signal was detected in all samples .
Partial restoration of expression is not observed if the co-transfection assay is carried out with an empty pCDNA3 vector .
The specificity of the relationship between IK over-expression and inhibition of HLA-DR-4 « transcription is shown by the absence of modulation in HLA-DR- « mRNA level observed when only the pHyg plasmid was integrated or when an empty pCDM8 vector was used for the co-transfection assay , and also by the reversibility of the inhibition observed after antisenses transfection .
Modulation of endogenous CIITA mRNA expression Recently , Steimle et al .
( 1993 ) have characterised the defective regulatory factor ( named CIITA ) which is partially deleted in the mutant cell line RJ 2.2.5 .
To determine whether the inhibition of HLA-DR- « transcription observed in Raji cells after IK cDNA integration is driven by a modulation of CIITA mRNA expression we have developed a highly sensitive RT PCR technology to detect CIITA mRNA levels in the different stably transfected clones ( Figure 6A and B ) .

clones cells ( Brown et al .
, 1995 ) .
A strong decrease in CIITA mRNA expression is detected in the stably IK-transfected clones .
In contrast , no difference was observed for the stably transfected cells which have only integrated the pHyg plasmid .
Primers used here to amplify the CIITA cDNA were selected from the deleted region previously described for RJ 2.2.5 cells ( Steimle et a/ .
, 1993 ) .
Lack of CIITA specific RT - PCR product observed here is effectively due to the absence of CIITA mRNA expression .
In summary , these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the over-expression of IK protein induced the decrease of CIITA mRNA expression level observed in IK-transfected Raji cells and that IK protein is a novel element involved in the negative regulatory pathway of constitutive MHC class II antigens expression .
Endogenous IK mRNA level is not affected by the restoration of CIITA expression To begin to study the mechanism by which IK protein expression is regulated in B cells we propose first to determine the influence of CIITA expression on IK mRNA level in RJ 2.2.5 cells .
Transfection using the EBO-CIITA vector led to 54 hygromycin resistant clones .
The RT-PCR analysis was carried out in order to verify the exogenous CIITA mRNA expression in these transfected cells ( Figure 7A ) .
All resistant cells are CIITA positive .
Specificity of the cDNA amplification is validated by the RT - PCR signal obtained for Raji cells and by the positive amplification observed with a CIITA-expressing vector DNA as template .
HLA-DR flow cytometry analysis allowed us to separate the CIITA expressing RJ 2.2.5 cells into three categories : 28 ( 51 % ) resistant clones exhibit a high level of HLA-DR antigens , 16 ( 29 % ) display an intermediary level .
Ten ( 20 % ) clones express these antigens at a very weak level ( data not shown ) .
Two of the high HLA-DR expressing clones have been selected and tested for endogenous IK mRNA expression .
Northern blot analysis ( Figure 7B ) shows no notable modulation in endogenous IK mRNA level after restoration of CIITA expression in RJ 2.2.5 cells .
The above experiments imply that IK mRNA levels are unaffected by CIITA expression in the RJ 2.2.5 cell line .
Intracellular localisation of IK protein Based on the absence of 'nuclear addressing signal ' in the peptide sequence of IK we have assessed the intracellular distribution of the protein by confocal microscopic analysis .
Figure 8A shows a specific signal in RJ 2.2.5 cells in contrast with the lack of IK expression in Raji cells ( Figure 8B ) .
Moreover , this experiment clearly demonstrates that IK protein is exclusively expressed in the cytoplasm of the cells .
Discussion Regulation of MHC class II antigen expression is crucial for an efficient specific immune response .
This regulation has been recently studied using laboratory 1457 IK inhibits HLA class II constitutive expression J Vedrenne et al 1458 A B 7 8 9 IK % ( 21 Kb ) ~ Q Wile saz CIITA se 4 ( 305 bp ) 7 8 9 GAPDH % ( 1.4 Kb ) ~ a ¢ « m C 7 8 9 GAPDH 1173.0 - 1158.0 595.0 IK 1984.0 1174.0 774.0 IK mRNA relative expression ( arbitrary units ) 33.8 20.28 25.08 Figure 7 RT-PCR analysis and Northern blot assay of mRNA extracted from CIITA-transfected RJ 2.2.5 cells .

Based on complementation experiments , these MHC class II negative cells have been classified into four complementation groups ( A , B , C and D ) ( Benichou and Strominger , 1991 ) .
Depending on the group two variety of disorders were described .
Certain patients exhibit a normal MHC class II promoter binding profile but are deficient in mRNA expression of transacting factors ( CIITA in the group A ) .
Patients of the B and C groups show a defect in MHC class II promoter occupancy ( Kara and Glimcher , 1991 , 1993 ; Steimle et al .
, 1995 ) .
This latter group ( C ) is also characterised by a defect in RFXS5 gene expression ( Steimle et al .
, 1995 ) .
Steimle et al .
( 1993 , 1994 ) have described and cloned the transactivator CIITA and thereby established that this molecule is essential for both the constitutive and the IFN-y induced HLA-DR positive transcription .
Actually , CIITA mRNA expression is an early step in this process .
Recent studies have proposed that CIHITA do not directly interact with DNA in the HLA-DR promoter ( Steimle et al .
, 1993 ; Riley et al .
, 1995 ; Zhou and Glimcher , 1995 ) , suggesting that the CIITA transcriptional activity on the HLA-DR gene may be provided by the stabilisation of the 'multi-protein complex ' which binds to this promoter region .
Riley et al .
( 1995 ) have proposed that CIITA only acts as a starting switch of MHC class II transcription .
Zhou and Glimcher ( 1995 ) have suggested that the CIITA protein should be one of the determinant factors involved in the MHC class II transcriptional { ON ) OFF » switch .
In our laboratory we have characterised a new protein IK which inhibits the IFN-y induced MHC class II expression ( Krief et al .
, 1987 , 1994 ) .
In this paper we discuss the role of this new molecule in the regulation of constitutive MHC class II expression .
We have transfected IK cDNA into Raji cells in order to express this protein in B cells which previously exhibited wild-type CIITA and HLA-DR-y mRNA expression levels .
Stably transfected clones which over-express exogenous IK mRNA are tested by immunofluorescence detection for surface HLA-DR antigens expression .
We show that this specific signal is totally reduced in the exogenous IK positive transfected cells .
This result is confirmed at the transcriptional level by RT - PCR analysis .
In contrast , cells which do not express the exogenous IK mRNA remain HLA-DR positive following the transfection assay .
No HLA-DR- « mRNA is detected in these cells .
Moreover , down regulation of HLA-DR- « mRNA expression in IK-transfected Raji cells is reversed by IK -antisenses transfection .
These findings strongly suggest the inhibitory key role for IK protein in the regulation of constitutive HLA-DR transcription .
Two mechanisms are conceivable regarding the role of IK on constitutive HLA-DR expression .
First , IK protein may have a direct inhibitory effect on the binding to the HLA-DR promoter of one or more MHC class II transcriptional factors .
This possibility would require a nuclear localisation for the IK protein .
Moreover , in this first hypothesis the level of CIITA transcript should not be altered in the IK over-expressing transfected cells .
Preliminary analysis of the IK amino acid sequence failed to reveal a 'nuclear addressing signal ' which is generally considered to facilitate the translocation of proteins to the nucleus ( Kalderon et al .
, 1984 ; Dingwall and Laskey , 1991 ) .
Confocal microscopic analysis Figure 8 Intracellular localisation of IK protein .
( A ) Confocal analysis of IK specific detection in RJ 2.2.5 cells .
Fluorescence intensity is correlated with the strength of IK expression .
This view allows us to confirm the absence of IK specific labelling in the central nucleus of RJ 2.2.5 cells .
( B ) Negative expression of IK protein in Raji cells IK mediated cytoplasmic sequestration Figure 9 Hypothesis on regulation of MHC class II expression .
Considering our results we propose a model in which IK inhibits the constitutive MHC class II expression through the indirect repression of CIITA transcription .
Modulation of CIITA expression plays a key role in the stabilisation and/or the activity of the transcriptional regulator 'multi-protein complex ' ( MC ) formed by CIITA , RFXq1 , .
; and other factors .
Several unknown intermediate proteins may be involved between IK and CIITA promoter IK inhibits HLA class II constitutive expression J Vedrenne et al confirm that IK protein is not located in the nucleus ( Figure 8 ) .
A second hypothesis is based on the modulation of the expression level of different MHC class II specific regulators .
In order to investigate the latter , we have assessed the CIITA mRNA level by RT-PCR in the stably IK-transfected cells We demonstrate that the over-expression of the exogenous IK mRNA induces a decrease in CIITA mRNA level .
In contrast , the transfected cells which have not integrated the exogenous IK cDNA had a normal CIITA mRNA expression .
These findings further support the second hypothesis .
Taken together these results establish a key role for IK protein in the regulation of constitutive HLA-DR expression .
IK mediated inhibition involved the modulation of CIITA mRNA expression .
Raji cells were tested for endogenous IK mRNA expression by both Northern blotting and a highly sensitive RT-PCR method .
Whereas no signal is detected by Northern blot analysis , a weak specific signal is detected in Raji cells .
These results can be explained if one considers the difference in sensitivity of these two techniques .
This result led to the consideration of the importance of the expression level of MHC class II regulators .
This point adds a new parameter which should be considered in the MHC class II phenotype determination .
Raji cells express a level of IK protein which is perhaps below the threshold level that induces CIITA transcriptional inhibition .
We believe that the IK/CIITA ratio may be a crucial controlling element for MHC class II membrane expression .
It is fully possible that the { ON ) signal is only delivered to the cellular transcriptional machinery when the intracellular CIITA protein level is above a certain threshold .
Over-expression of the IK protein maintains CIITA expression under this value , inducing a latent state of HLA-DR transcription repression .
These considerations suggest the existence of at least two potential values in the IK/CIITA ratio .
Reversible states in HLA-DR phenotype may be driven by these ratios .
The stage of differentiation and/or the activation state of B cells are related to their HLA-DR phenotype ( i.e .
, preB lymphocyte versus mature B lymphocyte or circulating B cells versus plasmocytes ) .
Recently , it has been shown that CIITA is extinguished in plasmocytes in comparison with B cells ( Silacci et a/ .
, 1994 ) .
Modulation of IK/CIITA ratio may be involved during these differentiations .
Considering the reversibility of the IK/CIITA level , we have studied IK mRNA modulation in CIITA-transfected RJ 2.2.5 cells RT-PCR amplification experiments led us to the following conclusions : IK mRNA level is independent of CIITA expression .
This result therefore excludes the possibility of a CIITA-mediated back regulation of IK expression .
The observation of a novel level of MHC class II regulation demonstrates not only the complexity but also the adaptability of MHC class II expression .
The cytoplasmic localisation of the IK protein suggests an indirect inhibitory effect on CIITA transcription .
Cytoplasmic sequestration of one or more positive transcriptional factor controlling CIITA expression may be one possibility by which IK acts indirectly on CIITA transcript level .
Inducible HLA-DR expression may be due to both the decrease of IK expression and 1459 IK inhibits HLA class II constitutive expression J Vedrenne et al 1460 to the induction of CIHIHTA expression .
In summary we propose a new scheme of constitutive MHC class II regulation which includes the IK protein .
( Figure 9 ) .
The important role of MHC class II antigens in host defences against the appearance , the development and the spread of several pathologies justify the character-isation of protein ( s ) which would permit the connection between IK and CIITA .
This study should lead to a better understanding of the regulation of MHC class II gene expression .
Materials and methods Cell lines and culture conditions The EBV positive Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines Raji and RJ 2.2.5 ( MHC class II negative mutant of Raji ) ( Accolla , 1983 ) and all stably transfected clones were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , 10 UI/ml penicillin and 10 ug/ml streptomycin .
Cells were diluted at 2 x 10° cells/ml every 3 days and incubated at 37°C in 5 % CO , .
Vectors construction IK cDNA cloning in the plasmid pCDM8 ( Invitrogen ) ( Seed , 1987 ; Seed and Aruffo , 1987 ) was performed as previously described ( Krief et al .
, 1994 ) .
Briefly , after BstX1 digestion of the stuffer region of pCDM8 , the 756 bp IK cDNA/BstX1 adapter modified was ligated in the polylinker region of the pCDM8 vector .
This construction ( named pCDM8-IK ) contains a correctly oriented sequence which allows , under the CMV promo-ter , the synthesis of IK protein .
The antisenses IK containing pCDNA3 ( Invitrogen ) ( named pCDNA3-iIK ) was obtained after classical EcoRI ligation of the IK cDNA sequence .
CIITA expressing vector is a special gift from Dr V Steimle .
Co-transfection and transfection assays Raji cells were washed in RPMI 1640 and resuspended in 800 ul of fresh culture medium .
5x 10° cells were co-transfected with 10 ug of plasmid pCDM8-IK or pCDM8 and/or 1 ug of plasmid pHyg .
DNA was added and cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature .
Samples were electroporated with an initial 240 V/960 uF pulse ( Gene pulser ; Bio-Rad Lab , Richmond , CA ) , incubated 10 min at room temperature and then electroporated with a second 240 V/960 uF pulse .
After 5 min at room temperature , electroporated cells were resuspended in 20 % fetal calf serum culture medium .
Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were diluted at 5 x 10° cells/ml in 96 wells plates and hygromycin was added at 200 ug/ml .
The selection was complete after 2 weeks .
Antisens transfection was carried out with 10 ug of pCDNA3-iIK plasmid and selection of stable transfected cells obtained after 2 weeks under 2 mg/ml of Neomycin ( G418 ) .
RJ 2.2.5 cells were electroporated in the above conditions .
10 ug of CIITA-expressing vector were used , selection was completed after 2 weeks in the presence of 400 ug/ml of hygromycin .
Northern blot Total RNA was extracted from 50x 10° cells using the guanidinium thiocyanate method previously described by Chomezynski and Sacchi ( 1987 ) .
To increase the percentage of mRNA poly ( A ) * , 400 ug of total RNA were passed through an oligo-dT ( Boehringer Mannheim ) column and poly ( A ) * RNA were collected after elution with 500 ul of distilled water .
This led to a 10 % increase in the percentage of mRNA .
Poly ( A ) + RNA was electrophoresed in 1 % agarose formaldehyde gel .
RNAs were transferred to Hybond N* ( Amersham ) membrane and prehybridized at 42°C for 1 h in 5 x SSC , 5 x Denhardt 's solution , 50 % formamid , 0.1 % SDS , 0.1 mg/ml salmon testes denatured DNA ( Sigma ) , 0.1 M phosphate buffer and 5 % dextran Sulfate .
The same buffer was used for the over-night hybridization at 42°C with the [ « PJdCTP randomly-primed ( Boehringer Mannheim ) heat denatured IK probe .
Filters were washed twice with 2x SSC } , 0.1 % SDS at room temperature and with 0.1 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS at 50°C .
Blots were exposed in a PhosphorImager `` box ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Reverse transcription One ug of mRNA was used in each reverse transcription ( RT ) reaction .
The mRNA secondary structure was denatured by incubating samples in 1 x RT Buffer ( Gibco BRL ) , 20 IU RNasin ( Promega ) at 68°C for 10 min and rapid transfer at 4°C .
10 mm DTT ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , 2.5 uM hexaprimer ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , 1 mM dNTPs ( Boehringer Mannheim ) and 200 IU of M-MLV reverse transcriptase ( Gibco BRL ) were then added and samples incubated for 5 min at room temperature , 45 min at 42°C and at 95°C for 5 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase .
Oligonucleotides Deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesised by means of an automatic DNA synthesiser ( Beckman ) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry .
Primers used for Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) were as follows : for HLA-DRa : DRA.1 ( bp 349 to 373 ) 5-CTCACGAACAGCCCTGTG-GAACTGA-3 ' and DRA.2 ( bp 556 to 580 ) 5'-CCCAGTGCTCCACCCTGCAGTCGTA-Y ; for CIHTA : JV.9 ( bp 352 to 376 ) 5-CAGGCTGTITTGTGTGACATG-GAAGGT-3 ' and JV.10 ( bp 731 to 755 ) 5-TGGA-GAAAGGCATGGGAATCTGGTC-3 ' ; for endogenous IK : IK.6 ( bp 82 to 101 ) CAA-3 ' and IK.7 ( bp 331 to 350 ) 5-CCAGCAGACC-CAGCAAACTT-3 ; for exogenous IK : IK.8 ( bp 612 to 636 ) 5-CCGCCCTTCAGACATTTTGATACCA-3 and MS8.1 ( bp 2205 to 2229 ) 5-GAGATCCCTCGACCTCGA-GATCCAT-3 ' and for GAPDH : 3R ( bp 273 to 294 ) 5'-GAGGGATCTCGCTCCTGGAAGA-3 ' and 5D ( bp 78 to 97 ) 5-GGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGA-3 ' .
High sensitive Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR In a final volume of 50 ul , 1 uM of each primer , 200 um of each dNTP and 1.25 IU of Taq Polymerase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) were added to 2 ul of reverse transcription reaction .
High sensitivity is obtained by addition of 0.1 Ci of [ « `` P ] dCTP in each sample .
The DNA was denatured at 94°C for 1 min , annealed at 58°C ( GAPDH , CIITA and HLA-DR- « ) or at 52°C ( IK ) for 1 min and extended at 72°C for 1 min 30 s. This cycle was repeated 20 times for GAPDH amplification and 28 times for IK , CIITA or HLA-DR- « amplification .
A final elongation step ( 72°C for 10 min ) was performed to stop the reaction .
Revelation and quantification Samples are loaded on a 5 % acrylamide gel .
Migration is carried out at 150 V for 2 h. DNA is fixed by a 10 % acid acetic/20 % methanol solution and the gel dried before its exposition in a PhosphorImager `` box ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
The Imagequant `` ' `` software reveals the integrated volume intensity of each peak .
Signals quantification is calculated as follows : data of the studied gene is reported on the GAPDH intensity peak .
Immunofluorescence analysis Extracellular labelling : Monoclonal anti-HLA-DR specific antibody used in these experiments was produced in our laboratory ( Perrot et al .
, 1986 ) .
2 x 10° cells were pelleted in 96 wells microplates and incubated in culture medium with 10 ug/ml of anti-HLA-DR for 20 min at 4°C .
The cells were washed and incubated for 15 min at 4°C in the obscurity with 20 ug/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobuline ( GAM-FITC ) ( Immunotech SA ) .
After washing , cells were analysed using a FACScan flow cytometer ( Epics , Coulter ) .
Intracellular labelling : Cells were washed twice with Phosphate Buffered Saline ( PBS ) , cells were fixed in 0.25 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1h at 4°C .
Then cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.2 % Tween 20 in PBS for 15 min at 37°C .
Cells were incubated with a blocking solution of 0.5 % Human-IgG in PBS for 10 min .
Monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) from ascitic fluid 1CS5B11 ( Krief et al .
1994 ) was used at 1/1000 in a solution of 0.5 % Azide , and 2 % FCS .
Cells were incubated for 45 min with mAb ICS5B11 at 4°C then washed twice before incubation with GAM-FITC ( Immunotech S.A ) .
Before use , glass coverslips ( Inter Med ) were maintained for 1 h at 4°C with polylysine 1 mg/ml in PBS solution .
After washing twice cells were added and remain glued on the polylysine-coated-coverslip plates .

IK inhibits HLA class II constitutive expression J Vedrenne et al Laser scanning confocal microscopy ( LSCM ) analysis Labelled specimens were scanned with an ACAS 570 Interactive Laser Cytometer ( Meridian Instruments , Inc. , Okemos , MI , USA ) , equipped with confocal optics .
The system consisted of a SW argon ion laser tuned to 488 nm , an Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope with a 100 x oil immersion objective ( N.A.1.3 ) , Z-axis control , an XY scanning stage and a variable pinhole aperture , all under 80486 computer co-ordination .
The ACAS 570 was set up in fluorescence mode .
FITC was excited at 488 nm .
The computer converts fluorescence intensity into colour as output image .
The excitation was done at 20 NW power and the filter constitution for emission detection was that is conventionally used for FITC 520 nm .
To obtain a good resolution , pinhole and photomultiplier voltage were set at 40 and 25 % respectively .
