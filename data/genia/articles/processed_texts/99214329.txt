Mutational analyses identified residues of PXQXT/S in STP-A11 as critical for TRAF association .
In addition , a somewhat divergent region of STP-C488 is critical for TRAF association .
Mutational analysis also revealed that STP-C488 induced NF-KB activation that was correlated with its ability to associate with TRAFs .
The HVS STP-C488 P , , -R mutant was deficient in human T-lymphocyte transformation to interleukin-2-independent growth but showed wild-type phenotype for marmoset T-lymphocyte transformation in vitro and in vivo .
The STP-C488 P ; , -R mutant was also defective in Rat-1 fibroblast transformation , and fibroblast cell transformation was blocked by a TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant .
These data implicate TRAFs in STP-C488-mediated transformation of human lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts .
Other factors are implicated in immortalization of common marmoset T lymphocytes and may also be critical in the transformation of human lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts .
Members of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor ( TNFR ) superfamily are important for lymphoid organ devel-opment , lymphocyte activation , acute-phase responses , cell growth , and apoptosis ( 3 , 22 , 49 ) .
The TNFR superfamily includes TNFR1 , TNFR2 , CD27 , CD30 , CD40 , Fas ( CD95 ) , 4-1BB , and OX40 ( 45 ) .
The cytoplasmic regions of TNFR1 , TNFR2 , CD30 , or CD40 are required for receptor-mediated signaling and interact with TNF receptor-associated factors ( TRAFs ) ( 8 , 23 , 43 , 48 ) .
TRAFZ and TRAF3 have an amino terminal RING finger structure , and all TRAFs have more than one zinc finger .
TRAFs also have a predicted extended alpha-helical coiled-coiled hydrophobic heptad repeat domain ( 8 ) .
A carboxyl-terminal TRAF domain of approximately 200 amino acids can be further divided into the TRAF-N and TRAF-C subdomains .
The highly conserved carboxyl-terminal TRAF-C domain mediates interaction with TNFRs ( 48 ) .
The cytoplasmic region of LMP1 , which is a key effector of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -mediated transformation , also binds to TRAFs , and this interaction is essential for B lymphocyte growth transformation ( 24 , 38 ) .
Human and simian LMP1 , CD40 , and CD30 and a cytoplasmic TRAF-interacting protein , TANK , share a PXQXT/S core sequence through which they interact with TRAFs ( 8 , 20 , 21 ) .
TRAF2 is a mediator of NF- « B and Jun kinase activation from the TNFRs and LMP1 ( 13 , 35 , 46 , 54 ) .
Herpesvirus saimiri ( HVS ) , a gamma-2 herpesvirus or rhadi-novirus , infects most squirrel monkeys without causing apparent disease ( 11 , 17 ) .

3913 HVS induces rapidly fatal T-cell lymphoproliferative diseases ( 19 , 27 ) .
Sequence divergence among HVS isolates is most extensive at the left end of the viral genomic DNA and is the basis for the classification of HVS into subgroups A , B , and C ( 9 , 36 ) .
Sequence variation in the STP gene in this region correlates with different capacities for immortalizing T lymphocytes in vitro and for inducing lymphoma in nonhuman primates ( 5 , 9 , 12 , 32 ) .
Subgroup A and subgroup C viruses can immortalize common marmoset T lymphocytes to interleu-kin-2 ( IL-2 ) -independent proliferation ( 12 , 47 ) .
Highly oncogenic subgroup C strains are also able to immortalize human , rabbit , and rhesus monkey lymphocytes and induce fulminant lymphoma in rhesus monkeys ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 37 ) .
The STPs of subgroup A or C strains ( STP-A or STP-C ) can transform rodent fibroblast cells in vitro .
STP-C is considerably more potent ( 28 , 30 ) .
STP-C488 associates with cellular Ras in transformed cells ( 25 ) .
Mutations that disrupt Ras association disrupt the transforming ability of the STP-C488 oncogene ( 25 ) .
In contrast , STP-A binds to the SH2 domain of Src kinase and is phosphorylated by the associated Src kinase ( 34 ) .
Transgenic mice expressing STP-C488 developed invasive epithelial cell tumors ( 39 ) , while STP-A11 transgenic mice developed peripheral pleomorphic T-cell lymphomas ( 33 ) .
Deletion of STP from the group C strain 488 or from the group A strain 11 yields viruses that are no longer capable of immortalizing lymphocytes in vitro or of inducing fatal lymphomas in common marmosets ( 9 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 32 , 40 ) .
Since HVS lacking STP can be repeatedly isolated from the peripheral blood of common marmosets for months or years , STP is not required for viral replication or persistence in vivo , but it is essential for transformation in cell culture and for lymphoma induction in common marmosets ( 9 , 14 ) .
STP-A11 and STP-C488 are similar in genome location and 3914 LEE ET AL .
orientation and have limited sequence similarity ( 5 , 28 ) .
Both open reading frames encode a highly acidic amino terminus .
STP-C488 has 18 direct repeats of a collagen-like motif ( Gly-Pro-Pro or Gly-Pro-GIn ) that comprises more than 50 % of the protein and is predicted to have an alpha-helical triple structure ( 5 ) .
A mutation which disrupts the collagen repeats has been shown to disrupt the transforming activity of STP-C488 ( 26 ) .
STP-A11 is also glycine and proline rich .
STP-A11 and STP-C488 proteins have highly hydrophobic carboxyl termini which are sufficient for membrane interaction ( 26 ) .
Since STP-C likely oligomerizes through its collagen-like motif and associates with cellular membranes , STP-C may mimic a ligand-independent constitutively active receptor , like the EBV LMP1 protein .
STP-A could have similar properties .
In this report , we investigate this hypothesis and find that STP-A and STP-C associate with TRAF 1 , 2 , or 3 .
Furthermore , the STP-C488 TRAF binding site is required for NF- « B activation and cell growth transformation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and virus propagation .
Rat-1 , COS-1 , BOSC23 , and owl monkey kidney ( OMK 1637 ) cells cultivated in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium or minimal essential medium supplemented with penicillin , streptomycin , 1-glu-tamine , and 10 % ( vol/vol ) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( GIBCO BRL , Grand Island , N.Y. ) were used for the propagation of the HVS strain C488 .
Low-passage-number OMK cells ( < 30 passages ) were used for the transfections .
Primary human and common marmoset ( CeHlithrix jacchus ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were purified by using lymphocyte separation medium ( Organon Teknika Corp. , Malvern , Pa. ) .
Cultures of human and common marmoset PBMCs in immortalization assays with HVS recombinants were performed in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin , streptomycin , Fun-gizone , L-glutamine , 20 % ( vol/vol ) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum , and 5 mg of B-mercaptocthanol per liter .
A DEAE or calcium phosphate transfection was used for transient expression in COS-1 or BOSC23 cells , respectively .
Rat-1 cells were transfected with plasmid peDNA3-TRAF2 A6-86 by the calcium phosphate protocol , followed by the selection with 500 ug of G418 per ml .
Subsequently , these cells were transfected with pBabe-puro or pBabe-STP-C488 and selected with 5 ug of puromycin/ml .
Plasmid constructions .
All STP-C488 mutants have been described previously ( 26 ) .
Mutations in STP-A1l were generated by PCR by using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis ( 16 ) .
Oligonucleotide mutant primers from complementary strands of STP-A11 were synthesized with specific restriction enzyme sites within 5 ' and 3 ' primers to facilitate cloning into pBluescript KS ( + ) ( Stratagene , San Diego , Calif. ) .
PCR was carried out with a DNA thermal cycler ( Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments , Norwalk , Conn. ) under the following conditions : 30 cycles of 1 min at 55°C for annealing , 4 min at 72°C for polymerization , and 1 min at 94°C for denaturation .
The amplified DNA fragments containing mutations in STP-A11 were purified and cloned into the pBluescript KS ( + ) vector .
Each STP-A11 mutant was completely sequenced to verify the presence of the mutation and the absence of any other changes .
After confirmation of the DNA sequence , DNA containing the desired STP-A1l mutation was recloned into EcoRI and Bg/II cloning sites of the pFJ vector for gene expression .
TRAF2 A6-86 and flag-tagged TRAF1 , TRAF2 and TRAF3 have been described previously ( 31 ) .
Flag-tagged TRAF3-C and TRAF3 AC were constructed by PCR by using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and completely sequenced to verify the presence of the mutation and the absence of any other changes .
Virion DNA isolation .
HVS virion preparations were obtained from the virus-containing medium by removal of OMK cell debris by low-speed centrifugation , followed by pelleting of the virus at 18,000 rpm for 2 h in an S§-34 rotor .
To purify intact virion DNA , the virus was disrupted at 60°C for 2 h in lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris ( pH 8.5 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % ( vol/vol ) Sarkosyl , and 0.1 mg of proteinase K/ml .
Extraction of the aqueous solution , first with an equal volume of phenol and then twice with chloroform , was sufficient to purify the virion DNA for use in transfections .
Sterile cut pipette tips were used for manipulating virion DNA without shearing .
Construction of recombinant HVS .
Generation of the P ; - > R mutation in STP-C488 by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis has been described previously ( 26 ) .
A 3.6-kb clone , pNEB-C488-PX , containing the tyrosine kinase-interacting protein tip , STP-C488 , and herpesvirus saimiri U RNAs ( HSURs ) ( 5 , 15 ) , was used to provide a subcloning vector with flanking sequence adequate to facilitate recombination during cotransfection .
Digestion of this vector with EcoRV and Spel permitted insertion of the corresponding STP fragment containing the P ; , - > R mutation .
Linearized plasmid DNA containing the 3.6-kb viral DNA with the STP-C488/ P : , -R mutation was cotransfected into OMK cells with HVSASTP/SV40-SEAP virion DNA by the calcium phosphate protocol .
A pure form of recombinant virus with the secreted engineered alkaline phosphatase ( SEAP ) reporter re J. Virou .
placed with was isolated by limiting dilution and repeated selection of SEAP-negative virus onto OMK cell monolayers in 48-well tissue culture plates performed as described previously ( 15 ) .
SEAP production was detected by a liquid scintillation counter ; the chemiluminescence produced in cell culture medium was assayed by using Phospha-Light reagents ( Tropix Inc. , Bedford , Mass . )
according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
In vitro i talization of h and marmoset lymphocytes .
Assays of lymphocyte immortalization in vitro have been described previously ( 14 ) .
PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood specimens from human donors and common marmosets ( C. jfecchus ) by centrifugation through lymphocyte separation medium ( Organon Teknika Corp. ) followed by washing in RPMI culture medium .
PBMCs from each donor were individually washed , resus-pended in RPMI , and then distributed in 1-ml volumes containing approximately 10° cells into 12-well tissue culture plates .
A single well containing PBMCs from each donor was then infected at a multiplicity of infection ranging from 1 to 5 with 1 ml of fresh , purified HVS viral stocks .
Cells were maintained with RPMI 1640 growth medium which was changed every 3 to 4 days .
Immortalization or cell death was assessed microscopically .
Experimental infection of common marmosets .
The in vivo oncogenicity of the HVS-C488 recombinants was assessed by experimental infection of common marmosets .
Marmosets were injected intramuscularly with 10° 50 % tissue culture infective doses of virus in a volume of 1 ml .
Sera and blood cell pellets were collected and frozen at -70°C weekly during the first 4 weeks and every 2 weeks thereafter .
Viral loads in PBMC specimens were assessed periodically by duplicate plating of 10° PBMCs and serial threefold dilutions of PBMCs on OMK cells in 24-well tissue culture plates ( 14 ) .
Animals that became moribund were euthanized and received complete necropsies .
Tissues were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin , embedded in paraffin , sectioned , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin .
Immunoprecipitation , immunoblotting , and antibodies .
Cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer ( 0.15 M NaCl , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , and 50 mM HEPES buffer [ pH 8.0 ] ) containing 1 mM Na ; VO ; , 1 mM NaF , and protease inhibitors ( Ieupeptin , aprotinin , phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , pepstatin , and bestatin ) .
Precleared lysates were used for immunoprecipitation or immunoblot analysis .
The rabbit polyclonal antibody 109 and mouse monoclonal antibody A1.4 directed against STP-C488 used in these experiments have been described previously ( 28 ) .
Flag and AU-1 antibodies were purchased from KODAK IBI ( New Haven , Conn. ) and BABCO Biotech ( Berkeley , Calif. ) , respectively .
Isolation of genomic DNA and PCR analysis .
Genomic DNA was isolated with a Qiagene genomic isolation kit according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Five micrograms of purified genomic DNA was used for PCR amplification performed by using a 5 ' primer which corresponds to the upstream sequence of the STP-C488 gene and a 3 ' primer which corresponds to the downstream sequence of STP-C488 .
Amplified DNA was cloned into the TA cloning vector ( Invitro-gen , San Diego , Calif. ) .
Both strands from each of five independent clones were subsequently sequenced using an ABI PRISM 377 automatic DNA sequencer .
Reporter assays .
All transfections included pGKBgal , which expresses B-galactosidase from a phosphoglucokinase promoter , together with 3X- « B-luc , which has three copies of the NF-kB binding site from the murine major histo-compatibility complex class I promoter upstream of a minimal fos promoter and a luciferase gene .
At 48 h posttransfection , cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 pl of reporter lysis buffer ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) .
Assays for luciferase were performed with a Luminometer by using a luciferase assay ( Promega ) .
Values were normalized to B-galactosidase activity .
RESULTS HVS subgroup A and subgroup C STPs interact with TRAFs .
HVS STP-A has a PXQXT sequence similar to that in LMP1 , CD30 , CD40 and TANK ( 7 , 20 , 21 ) , while STP-C488 and STP-C484M have more divergent sequences with glutamic acid in place of glutamine ( Fig .
1 ) .
The potential interaction of STP with TRAFs was therefore investigated by transfecting BOSC23 cells with expression vectors for STP-A11l or STP-C488 and for TRAF1 , TRAF2 , or TRAF3 .
The amino termini of the TRAFs and STP-A11 were tagged with Flag and AU-1 epitopes , respectively .
After transfection , TRAF complexes were precipitated with an anti-Flag antibody and STP-A11 or STP-C488 was detected by immunoblotting .
STP-C488 was readily evident at 20 kDa in the TRAF 1 , 2 , or 3 precipitates ( Fig .
2A ) .
STP-A11 was expressed as 26- and 35-kDa proteins ( 34 ) .
STP-A11 and STP-C488 were not detected in precipitates from negative control cell lysates ( Fig .
2A and B , lanes 2 ) .
These tests demonstrate that STP-A1l and STP-C488 interacted specifically with TRAFs in BOSC23 cells .
Different regions of TRAF are required for binding to STP-A and STP-C. To confirm that TRAFs bind through their voL .

Sequence comparison of the amino-terminal regions of STPs with TRAF binding motifs .
The sequences of the amino-terminal regions of STPs from HVS subgroup A and C strains were aligned with TRAF-binding motifs of LMP1 , CD30 , CD40 , and TANK .
STP-A11 and STP-OMI belong to subgroup A , and STP-C484M and STP-C488 belong to subgroup C. Bold letters indicate the conserved amino acid sequence .
TRAF-C domain to the STP-A11 or STP-C488 , we evaluated the association of STP-A1l or STP-C488 with TRAF3-C , which contains the TRAF-C domain only , or with TRAF3 AC } , from which the TRAF-C domain has been deleted .
Flag-tagged TRAF3 , TRAF3 AC , or TRAF3-C was expressed in COS-1 cells along with STP-A11 or STP-C488 .
Anti-Flag antibody was used to precipitate TRAF complexes from cell lysates .
TRAF3-C bound to STP-A11 as efficiently as wild-type ( wt ) TRAF3 , whereas the TRAF3 AC did not bind to STP-A11 ( Fig .
3A ) .
In contrast , both TRAF3-C and TRAF3 AC failed to bind to STP-C488 , while wt TRAF3 bound efficiently to STP-C488 .
Under these conditions , similar amounts of TRAF3 , TRAF3-C , and TRAF3 AC and of STP-A1l and STP-C488 were expressed in COS-1 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
These results demonstrate that the TRAF-C domain is necessary and sufficient for its binding to STP-A11 , as it is for its binding to CD40 or LMP1 , while a domain ( s ) in addition to the TRAF-C domain is necessary for binding to STP-C488 .

The expression levels of TRAF ( C ) , STP-A11 ( D ) , and STP-C488 ( E ) were demonstrated by immunoblotting of cell lysates with specific antibodies .
Asterisks indicate the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulin , and arrows indicate each protein as labelled .
Mutational analysis of the putative STP-A11 and STP-C488 TRAF binding motifs .
To investigate whether the putative STP TRAF binding motif is required for TRAF association , two point mutations in the putative TRAF binding motif in STP-All were generated by site-directed mutagenesis ; codon 60 was deleted from one mutant ( STP-A11 AP4 , ) and glutamine encoded by codon 62 was replaced by alanine in a second mutant ( STP-A1l Q & , /A ) .
Seven STP-C488 mutants ( P ; y/R , /K , £E12E,3/6G , T/A , M1 , ANp ; , and A2-17 ) described previously ( 25 , 26 ) were also evaluated for the TRAF binding activity .
P : y/R , I ; /K , E1 ; £,7/GG , and T , /A are point mutations in the putative TRAF binding motif .
A2-17 is deleted for amino-terminal residues 2 to 17 , M1 has a three-amino-acid insertion in the collagen repeats , and AN , ; is deleted for the carboxyl-terminal amino acid ( 25 , 26 ) .
A2-17 and M1 mutants have been shown to be defective in Rat-1 transformation , whereas AN ; , , mutant shows wt Rat-1 transformation ( 25 , 26 ) .
After cotransfection of the STP genes and the TRAF2 genes into BOSC23 cells , an anti-Flag antibody was used to precipitate TRAF complexes .
The AP ; , and Q , , /A mutations in the STP-A1l PXQXT motif abolished complex formation with TRAF2 ( Fig .
4A ) .
Under these conditions , similar amounts of STP-A1l and its mutants were expressed .
The STP-C488 P ; y/R , L /K , and AZ2-17 mutations also abrogated TRAF binding activity , whereas the E ; , F , , /GG , T , , /A , MI , and 3916 _ LEE ET AL .

Mutational analysis of STP-A11 and STP-C488 for binding to TRAF .
BOSC23 cells were transfected with STP-A11 mutants ( A ) or STP-C488 mutants ( B ) together with TRAF2 expression vector as indicated at the bottom of the figure .
Cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation ( LP . )
with Flag antibody ( flag ) , followed by an immunoblot assay ( .B . )
with AU-1 antibody to detect STP-A11 ( top panel of A ) or A1.4 antibody to detect STP-C488 ( top panel of B ) .
The levels of STPs and TRAF2 expression were demonstrated by immunoblotting with their specific antibodies as indicated at the bottom of the figure .
AN , , mutations did not ( Fig .
4B ) .
Despite weak expression , the AN ; , , mutant was readily detected in TRAF complexes ( Fig .
4B ) .
The STP-C488 mutants migrated somewhat anom-alously ( Fig .
4B ) as described previously ( 26 ) .
These results indicate that the STP-A1l putative TRAF binding motif is important for TRAF association .
Furthermore , the STP-C488 putative TRAF binding motif appears to be part of the TRAF binding domain .
However , only the amino-terminal P ; , and I ; ; residues of the core site appear to be critical for TRAF .
STP-C488 activates NF-KB activity .
Since TRAF2 can mediate NF-KB activation by EBV LMP1 or TNF receptors ( 24 , 38 , 43 ) , we have investigated the effect of STP-C488 expression on NF-kB activation in 293 cells by using an NF- « B-driven luciferase reporter plasmid , 3X-kB-L , and a control B-galactosidase expression plasmid , pGKBgal .
Relative luciferase values were normalized to B-galactosidase activity for transfection efficiency .
Three independent assays showed that wt STP-C488 increased NF-kB activity approximately 3.5- to 6-fold .
The STP-C488 E ; , E , /GG , T , , /A , and M1 mutants were similar to wt STP-C488 , whereas no activation was induced by the STP-C488 PiyR : , P10/Q Pio/L 114/E .
, L /K , or A2-17 mutants ( Fig .
5A ) .
Luciferase activity required a wt NF-kB element ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that STP-C488 can activate NF-kB activity and that this activity is dependent upon the STP-C488 amino terminus , including P ; , and I , , , which are critical for TRAF association .
In striking contrast , STP-A11l did not induce NF-kB activation under the same conditions ( Fig .
5A ) .
Generation of HVS STP-C488 P , ; , -R recombinant .
To investigate the importance of the TRAF-binding activity of STP in virus-induced transformation , we constructed a recombinant HVS C488 with the STP-C488 P ; , -R mutation , which disrupts TRAF association and NF-kB activation .
The parental virion DNA from which the mutant was constructed had a SEAP reporter expression cassette in place of the STP-C488 gene and is nontransforming in culture and nononcogenic in common marmosets ( 14 ) .
After cotransfection with the parental virion DNA and a linearized plasmid containing the P ; , -R mutation in STP-C488 in the context of a flanking sequence homologous to the parental DNA , SEAP-negative virus was isolated by limiting dilution .
PCR and sequence analysis confirmed the presence of STP-C488 P ; , - > R in the putative recombinant virus ; the rest of the STP-C488 open reading frame was confirmed to be of the wt .
Transforming activity of recombinant HVS STP-C488 P ; , -R in common marmosets .
Primary common marmoset T lymphocytes were infected with recombinant HVS STP-C488 P ; ; -R , wt HVS , or the parental HVS ASTP-SV40-SEAP .
HVS , HVS ASTP-SV40-SEAP , and HVS STP-C488 P ; j , -R at equivalent titers were separately added to individually purified , unstimulated , common marmoset PBMCs .
HVS STP-C488 P , , - > R immortalized marmoset primary T lymphocytes to IL-2-independent growth within about 1 month postinfection and was similar to wt HVS in immortalizing efficiency , whereas HVS ASTP-SV40-SEAP was unable to immortalize the marmoset T cells ( Table 1 ) .
HVS STP-C488 P ; j-R was also compared with wt HVS in experimental common marmoset infection .
HVS STP-C488 P ; , - > R and wt HVS caused fatal lymphoproliferative disease with a roughly equivalent time course .
Animals infected with wt HVS became moribund and were sacrificed on days 19 and 20 ; animals infected with HVS STP-C488 P ; , became moribund and were sacrificed on day 20 postinfection ( Table 1 ) .
Necropsies of these animals revealed multicentric lymphoma that is consistent with previously described HVS-induced pathology ( 9 ) .
HVS STP-C488 P ; , lymphoma was indistinguishable from that induced by wt HVS .
To confirm that HVS STP-C488 P ; , - > R was present in the transformed common marmoset lymphocytes from tumor-bearing animals and in in vitro-immortalized cells , the lymphocytes were cocultivated with OMK cells .
Virus preparations were made from supernatant media and tested by PCR for STP-C488 DNA .

Cells were transfected with an NF- « B-driven luciferase reporter 3XxB plasmid together with the pGKBgal plasmid , which controlled for transfection efficiency .
Forty-cight hours after transfection , cell lysates were used for luciferase and B-galactosidase assays .
Where indicated , Rat-1 cells were treated with 10 ng of mouse TNF-a for 16 h. Luciferase activity was determined and normalized on the basis of B-galactosidase activities .
The fold activation expresses the normalized luciferase activity relative to that of the cells transfected with vector alone ( panel A ) or to that of Rat-babe cells ( panel B ) .

Thus , the TRAF binding activity of STP-C488 is not essential for virus-induced transformation of primary marmoset lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo .

HVS transformed the primary human lymphocytes from three of the five donors to IL-2-independent growth within about 2 months postinfection , while HVS and parental HVSASTP-SV40-SEAP failed to immortalize primary human T lymphocytes to IL-2-independent growth ( Table 1 ) .
These results indicate that STP-TRAF interaction is required for primary human lymphocyte transformation .
STP-C488 TRAF binding is also implicated in rodent fibroblast transformation .
STP-C488 P ; , -R mutant , which fails to bind to TRAFs , has been shown to be defective in Rat-1 cell transformation ( 26 ) .
To further investigate the specific role of TRAF-mediated signaling in STP transformation , we used a dominant-negative mutant of TRAF2 , TRAF2 A6-86 , which is deleted for the ring finger domain .
The TRAF2 ring finger domain is not required for binding to TNFR2 , CD40 , or LMP1 , and this mutant can block NF- « B activation induced by LMP1 ( 31 ) .
Rat-1 cells stably transfected with peDNA3-TRAF2 A6-86 or pcDNA3 vector were derived by selection in the presence of 500 wg of neomycin/ml .
Rat-1 and Rat-TRAF A6-86 cells were then transfected with a pBabe-puro vector or a pBabe-STP-C488 vector and selected with 5 wg of puromycin/ml .
STP-C488 and TRAF2 A6-86 expression was monitored by the immunoblot assay with anti-STP-C488 or anti-Flag antibody ( data not shown ) .
The growth properties of Rat-babe , Rat-STP-C488 , Rat-TRAFZ2 A6-86 , and Rat-STP-CA88/TRAF2 A6-86 cells were examined to investigate whether TRAF A6-86 could block STP-C488-mediated transformation .
As was shown previously ( 26 , 30 ) , STP-C488 transformed Rat-1 cells , resulting in focus formation ( Fig .
6C ) .
Foci were recognizable even before cells reached confluence .
The expression of TRAF2 A6-86 drastically suppressed the transformation of Rat-1 cells by STP-C488 ( Fig .
6D ) .
The number of foci observed for Rat-STP-C488 cells was over 1,000 per 10° cells , whereas Rat-STP-C488/TRAF A6-86 cells grew in flat monolayers and formed less than 40 foci per 10° cells .
These results demonstrate that the expression of the dominant-negative TRAF2 A6-86 mutant blocks Rat-1 cell transformation by STP-C488 .
Rat-babe , Rat-STP-C488 , Rat-TRAF2 A6-86 , and Rat-STP-CA488/TRAF2 A6-86 cells were also used to measure the level of NF- « B activity .
Cells were treated with TNF-a as controls .
TNF-a treatment or STP-C488 expression induced NF-kB activity in Rat-1 cells approximately fourfold more than that in control cells ( Fig .
5B ) .
However , TNF- « treatment did not further induce NF-KB activity in Rat-STP-C488 cells ( Fig .
5B ) .
In contrast , the expression of the dominant-negative mutant TRAF2 A6-86 abolished NF-kB activation by STP-C488 or TNF-a treatment ( Fig .
5B ) .
These results indicate that TRAF TABLE 1 .

mediated signaling is important for STP-C488-induced transformation and NF- « B activation in Rat-1 cells .
DISCUSSION In this report we demonstrate that STP of HVS subgroups A and C can associate with TRAFs .
Furthermore , STP-C488 activates NF-kB and this activation is dependent on the same STP-C488 residues that are required for TRAF association .
Moreover , an HVS STP-C488 P ; , - > R mutation that codes for an STP-C488 mutant , which does not interact with TRAF , can not transform primary human T lymphocytes or Rat-1 cells in vitro .
Thus , TRAF interaction is implicated in HVS STP-C488 transforming activity .
However , HVS STP-C488 P ; , -R is able to transform marmoset T lymphocytes and induce malignant lymphoma in marmosets .
TRAF binding is therefore only one component of STP-C488 transforming activity .
The observation that STP interaction with TRAF is required for human T-lymphocyte and Rat-1-cell transformation but not for marmoset T-lymphocyte transformation indicates that TRAF interaction is important for transformation in restricted genetic or developmental backgrounds .
This is not surprising , since HVS has a number of genes which may contribute to cell growth transformation , including those encoding tip , v-cyclin , vIL-17 , orf14 superantigen homolog , v€D59 , vbel-2 , vFLIP , and vIL-8 receptor , as well as the rest of the STP open reading frame ( 1 , 29 , 42 , 44 , 50 , 52 , 53 ) .
Since many of these genes are likely expressed in transformed marmoset T lymphocytes ( 18 ) , STP-TRAF-mediated signaling may be less important in this cell type .
In contrast , HVS is tightly latent in transformed human T lymphocytes , where the single bicistronic STP and tip transcript has been detected ( 18 ) .
Rat-l-cell transformation requires only STP-C488 .
Thus , HVS may be considerably less dependent on STP for marmoset lymphocyte transformation because of other viral genes expressed in these cells .
In addition , STP-C488 binding to cellular Ras is also important for Rat-1 cell transformation ( 25 ) , and the role of Ras interaction in marmoset and human lymphocyte transformation remains to be investigated .
HVS strains are classified into three subgroups ( subgroups A , B , and C ) based on sequence divergence in the STP and fip genes ( 5 , 36 ) .
Subgroups A and C are highly oncogenic and are able to immortalize common marmoset T lymphocytes , induc- FIG .

Inhibition of transformation of STP-C488 by the dominant-negative TRAF2 mutant .
Rat-1 fibroblast cells were plated at 10° cells per 100-mm-diameter tissue culture dishes .
After 14 days ' incubation , cells were photographed to show foci of transformed cells at magnification of X100 ( bottom ) and after staining with methylene blue ( top ) .

ing transformation to growth in an IL-2-independent manner in vitro , while subgroup B does not have these properties ( 13 , 37 ) .
Subgroup C strains are in addition capable of immortalizing human , rabbit , and rhesus monkey lymphocytes into continuously proliferating T-cell lines ( 1 , 3 ) .
All STP-A and STP-C isolates which have been sequenced so far appear to be similar around the TRAF-binding sites that have been revealed by the biochemical and genetic analyses described here ( 18 , 34 ) .
These experiments show that oncogenes from the transforming gamma herpesviruses EBV and HVS employ TRAF as a common cellular factor for their activities .
Previous experiments with EBV LMP1 point up the importance of both aggregation and TRAF binding in signaling ( 24 , 38 ) .
STP-C488 can also oligomerize through its collagen-like motif ( unpublished re-sults ) .
Thus , the HVS STP-C488 and EBV LMP1 may mimic a ligand-independent constitutively active receptor .
While STPs of HVS subgroups A and C bind to TRAF 1 , 2 , and 3 , only STP-C488 interaction with TRAF appears to activate NF-kB activity .
This may explain why STP-C488 is considerably more potent in Rat-1-cell transformation than STP-All ( 30 ) .
On the other hand , STP-A1l may use TRAF interaction for the activation of downstream effectors other than NF- « B , e.g .
, activation of stress-activated protein kinase or inhibitors of apoptosis ( 41 , 51 , 54 ) .
Further studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of HVS STP-TRAF-mediated signal transduction .
