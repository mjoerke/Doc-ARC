Communication A Hydrophobic Domain of Ca**-modulating Cyclophilin Ligand Modulates Calcium Influx Signaling in T Lymphocytes* ( Received for publication , September 28 , 1995 , and in revised form , February 3 , 1996 ) Michael P. Hollowayt and Richard J. Bram # §| From the Departments of { Experimental Oncology and §Hematology / Oncology , St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital , Memphis , Tennessee 38105 and « Department of Pediatrics , University of Tennessee , Memphis , Tennessee 38105 Ca `` *-modulating cyclophilin ligand ( CAML ) was originally described as a cyclophilin B-binding protein whose overexpression in T cells causes a rise in intracellular calcium , thus activating transcription factors responsible for the early immune response .
As reported here , structure-function analysis of the CAML gene in Jurkat T cells indicates that two of CAML 's putative membrane-spanning domains are necessary and sufficient for the modulation of intracellular calcium .
We propose that the hydrophobic C-terminal tail of CAML forms its effector domain , thus implicating the N-terminal hydrophilic domain in a regulatory role .
These findings define a novel protein motif that functions in intracellular calcium signaling .
The complex of cyclophilin A or cyclophilin B with the im-munosuppressant drug cyclosporin A has been shown to bind and inhibit the calcium dependent phosphatase calcineurin ( 1-4 ) .
Because weak binding of cyclophilins to calcineurin can be detected even in the absence of cyclosporin A , it has been proposed that the cyclophilins normally participate in the regulation of calcineurin ( 5 ) .
Ca**-modulating cyclophilin ligand ( CAML ) * was isolated by a yeast two-hybrid screen of a B lymphocyte cDNA library using cyclophilin B as bait for endogenous cyclophilin ligands ( 6 ) .
When overexpressed in Jurkat T cells , this cyclophilin-binding protein causes the calcineurin-dependent activation of NFAT , a T cell-specific transcription factor responsible for inducing interleukin-2 expression ( 1 ) .
The site of action of CAML was determined to be downstream of the T cell receptor and upstream of calcineurin .
Further support of a role for CAML in calcium signaling was provided by observations that CAML * This work was supported in part by Cancer Center CORE Grant CA-21765 from the National Institutes of Health , by Grant BE-234 from the American Cancer Society , and by the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities ( ALSAC ) .

Printed in U.S.A. overexpression relieves the requirement for increased [ Ca** ] ; for activation of NFAT but does not relieve the requirement for protein kinase C activation .
The sequence analysis of human CAML failed to show significant homology to other proteins by BLAST and TFASTA algorithms ( 7 , 8 ) , but two distinct domains are apparent in hydrophobicity plots .
The Goldman , Engelman , and Steitz hydrophobicity scale method ( 9 ) predicted three membrane-spanning segments in the C-terminal end of CAML and a charged hydrophilic N-terminal half ( 6 ) .
Functional analysis of the CAML gene has allowed us to identify domains that modulate calcium flux .
Here we show that the residues encompassing the last two putative membrane-spanning segments are necessary and sufficient for inducing NFAT activity in T cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids and Deletions-The pFLEX expression vector was constructed by inserting 27 base pairs that encode the FLAG epitope into the pBJ5 mammalian expression vector polylinker ( 10 ) .
CLX31 was constructed by inserting CAML cDNA into pFLEX , as described previously ( 6 ) .
Plasmids directing expression of truncated forms of CAML were made by standard protocols that included exonuclease III digestion and polymerase chain reaction ( 11 ) .
Fragments of the CAML coding sequence generated by polymerase chain reaction and use of Pfu polymerase ( Stratagene ) were ligated into the XAhol and EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites of pFLEX .
Plasmids are designated by the amino acid residues included in the product protein , with 1-296 being the full-length native protein .
The primer sequences are listed in Table I .
The SXNFAT plasmid is described elsewhere ( 12 ) .
Briefly , it contains three copies of the NFAT enhancer element and the interleukin-2 minimal promoter to direct expression of the secreted alkaline phosphatase ( SEAP ) gene .
Cell Culture-TAg Jurkat T cells , stably transfected with the SV40 large T antigen , were obtained from J. Northrop ( Stanford Medical Center ) and maintained in RPMI 1640 ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) plus 10 % fetal calf serum ( Gemini Bioproducts ) at 37°C in 5 % CO , at a density of 10°-10® cells/ml .
COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) plus 10 % fetal calf serum .
NFAT Functional Assay-Mutant CAML expression was assayed by transient co-transfection with the NFAT reporter plasmid , SXNFAT , using 6 ug of pFLEX or CAML expression construct , 6 ug of SXNFAT , and 2 pg of a vector expressing luciferase as a transfection control .
Electroporation into TAg Jurkat cells and measurement of NFAT-SEAP were performed as described previously ( 12 ) .
Treatment of the transfected cells with 32 nm PMA was used to activate the nuclear subunit of NFAT , AP1 ( 18 ) .
Luciferase activity was measured by standard proto-cols .
Western blot assays of FLAG-labeled CAML constructs indicated that the deletion mutants were correctly expressed in transiently transfected COS cells .
Monoclonal FLAG-M2 antibody was obtained from Kodak .
FACS Analysis-TAg Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with 6 ug of a CAML expression vector together with 2 ug of co-transfected vector expressing mouse CD8 .
Cells were stained with rat anti-mouse CD8 conjugated to fluorescein and with 3 uM indo-l1 acetoxymethyl ester ( Molecular Probes ) .
Cytoplasmic calcium was measured in the transfected ( CD8 positive ) cells on a Becton Dickinson FACS Vantage instrument by determining the ratio of indo-1 fluorescence at 400-480 nm following excitation at 334-864 nm ( 14 ) .
Cells transfected with CD8 plasmid alone served as the control .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Activation of the T cell-specific transcription factor NFAT was assayed by co-transfection of CAML expression plasmids with the NFAT-SEAP plasmid SXNFAT .

The effect of CAML overexpression on the Ca** depend- vector ence of NFAT transcription activation .
Cells were cotransfected with CAML expression plasmid and the SEAP reporter , as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
The transfected cultures were treated with 0.25-12.5 nM thapsigargin and 32 nM PMA for 24 h. The y values presented are the percent of the maximal stimulation for each transfection and are the average of three separate transfections .
Assay values were normalized for variations in transfection efficiency with an assay for co-transfected luciferase expression vector .

and Ca** ( by treatment with PMA plus ionomycin ) and is completely blocked by cyclosporin A or FK506 .
As shown previously ( 6 ) , overexpression of full-length CAML replaced the usual requirement for Ca** influx , while having no effect on the requirement for PMA costimulation , consistent with a selective effect on Ca** signaling .
To define the degree of activation in transiently transfected T cells more precisely , we developed an assay comparing the effects of CAML and mutant constructs with that of thapsigargin .
Unlike ionomycin , which acts at both the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell surface , thapsigargin activates capacitative Ca** influx selectively by depleting intracellular Ca** stores ( 15-18 ) .
NFAT activation in control cells was characterized by a discrete maximal response at 5 nm thapsigargin ( Fig .
1 , dotted line ) with PMA costimula-tion .
By marked contrast , CAML overexpression not only significantly activated NFAT in the absence of thapsigargin but also shifted the dose-response curve to the left , causing a maximal response at 2.5 nw and a marked enhancement of activation due to thapsigargin concentrations as low as 250 pm ( Fig .
1 , solid line ) .
A reproducible measure of CAML activity could be obtained by expressing the degree of activation due to CAML plus PMA as a percentage of maximal activation induced by the addition of thapsigargin .
To define the active residues in the CAML protein , we made 10 different deletion mutants and inserted them into the eu karyotic expression plasmid pFLEX , which adds the FLAG 5 % 15 % 35 % 55 % 75 % % maximal stimulation Fic .

blotting with the FLAG monoclonal antibody ( data not shown ) .
Each protein yielded a band of the correct size on Western blots , thus demonstrating roughly similar levels of accumulation .
Transfection-titration experiments in Tag Jurkat cells were performed with the 10 mutant CAML constructs together with the control and full-length vectors .
Fig .
24 shows the portions of CAML-coding sequence left in each construct , while Fig .
2B indicates the effectiveness of each construct at activating NFAT as a percentage of maximal activation due to CAML plus thapsigargin .
Deletions removing a portion of or all of the N-terminal half of the protein had no important effect in the assay ( compare residues 189-296 with the full-length 1-296 ) nor did removal of the last seven amino acids from the short hydrophilic C terminus ( 1-289 ) .
By contrast , removal of 46 residues from the C-terminal end ( 1-250 ) effectively abolished NFAT activity .
To further localize the activating activity within the hydrophobic domain , we next tested plasmids encoding subregions of the three putative transmembrane domains .
One that encoded a surprisingly small part of the protein , the predicted second and third membrane-spanning regions ( residues 240-289 ) , was active in this assay .
The loop region ( residues 220-240 ) between the putative membrane domains 1 and 2 was not neces-sary , as it could be deleted without any apparent effect ( compare 220-289 with 240-289 ) .
Domains 1 and 2 ( 195-265 ) or either domain 2 or 3 alone ( 220-265 and 268-289 ) lacked significant activity in the NFAT assay .
We conclude from these experiments that domains 2 and 3 are necessary and sufficient to form the minimum active fragment of CAML .
This interpretation is supported by independent comparison of human and chicken CAML genes showing that the greatest area of sequence similarity is within the C terminus ( 19 ) .
Indeed , of the 50 residues within the 240-289 domain , 46 were identical between the two species and two others were highly conserved .
Because overexpression of CAML shifts the dose-response curve of thapsigargin to lower drug levels , we inferred that CAML acts positively in this signaling pathway to activate NFAT .
To examine the possibility of a dominant negative effect in any of the mutant CAML constructs we similarly investigated dose-response curves for a shift to higher thapsigargin levels .
The 240-289 active fragment , containing the putative second and third membrane-spanning domains , displays elevated NFAT activity and increased sensitivity to thapsigargin , as indicated by the left shift of the titration curve ( Fig .
3 , triangles ) .
The assay results with this plasmid resemble those of transfections with the full-length CAML plasmid , although the values are often higher with the short fragment , suggesting the possibility of an inhibitory or modulatory region within the N-terminal half of the protein .
Each mutant plasmid with NFAT stimulating activity ( 1-289 , 44-296 , 189-296 , 220-289 , and 240-289 ) also showed a similar shift of thapsigargin response to lower levels .
By contrast , each of the inactive mutant plasmids ( 1-250 , 1-201 , 195-265 , 220-265 , 268-289 ) , while directing appropriate protein expression as measured by Western blot analysis , did not shift the response of cells to thapsigargin to higher levels by comparison with control transfections ( Fig .
3 , squares and data not shown ) .
Thus , we can find no evidence for a dominant negative effect of any of our constructs .
Similar results were obtained using ionomycin titration instead of thapsigargin .
To further localize the effects of overexpression of mutant CAML constructs , we asked whether calcineurin was an obligate intermediate in the activation of NFAT .
Cells transfected with the 240-289 expression plasmid were stimulated with PMA in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A at 100 ng/ml .
Addition of this immunosuppressive level of cyclosporin A completely abrogated NFAT expression ( data not shown ) , consistent with our model in which this CAML fragment triggers NFAT through activation of calcineurin .
To verify that the activation of calcineurin was due to elevation of Ca** , we measured the effect of the residue 240-289 expression plasmid on cytoplasmic Ca** levels .
Cells transfected with full-length CAML and those expressing the 240-289 deletion mutant were loaded with indo-1 and identified by staining for a cell surface co-transfected marker .
Control transfections had normal resting Ca** fluorescence levels ( Fig .
44 ) , while cells overexpressing either CAML or the 240-289 fragment displayed a significant number showing markedly elevated [ Ca2+ ] i ( Fig .
4 , B and C ) .
Addition of EGTA to the cell medium during the FACS analysis caused cells with elevated [ Ca2+ ] i to drop down to base line within 4-5 s ( data not shown ) .
Thus , overexpression of this relatively small peptide is sufficient to elevate [ Ca2+ ] i to levels similar to that of the full-length protein , an effect likely produced by increased influx of Ca** from outside the cell .
The structure-function data presented here demonstrate that residues 240-289 of CAML are necessary and sufficient to activate Ca** influx when overexpressed in Jurkat T cells .
These residues overlap the previously noted transmembrane domains 2 and 3 .
Because the N-terminal half of the protein does not activate Ca** influx and is not necessary for the activity of the 240-289 fragment , we propose that it may regulate CAML function under normal circumstances .
However , we can not exclude a regulatory role for other factors ( e.g .
altered interference by interacting proteins or altered subcellular 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 8552 Hydrophobic Signaling Domain in CAML localization ) .
Studies to address this issue are under way .
The finding that the modest 50-residue fragment of CAML can activate Ca** influx argues against an enzymatic role for CAML in this context , since it seems unlikely that such a small peptide could catalyze a reaction producing a small second messenger .
We favor instead a model in which this domain of CAML forms a direct protein interaction site by which it contacts and activates the next signaling protein in the pathway .
The downstream target of CAML is currently unknown but could include such well characterized molecules as the inositol trisphosphate receptor or the endoplasmic reticulum Ca** pump or the hypothesized intracellular Ca** leak channel ( 20 ) .
To date , we have not been able to ascertain the filling state of intracellular stores in CAML-overexpressing cells and hence can not yet place the putative target upstream or downstream of the site where the capacitative Ca** influx signal is gener-ated .
Indeed , because of the extreme hydrophobic nature of residues 240-289 , CAML may itself be a component of an internal Ca** channel .
