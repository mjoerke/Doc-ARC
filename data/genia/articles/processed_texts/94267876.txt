7 Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Tat Upregulates Interleukin-2 Secretion in Activated T Cells MICHAEL O. WESTENDORP , ' MIN LI-WEBER , ' RAINER W. FRANK , `` anp PETER H. KRAMMER'* Division of Immunogenetics , Tumorimmunology Program , German Cancer Research Center , `` and Center of Molecular Biology , University of Heidelberg , `` D-69120 Heidelberg , Federal Republic of Germany Received 10 June 1993/Accepted 6 April 1994 Dysregulation of cytokines secreted by T cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS .
To investigate the effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat on interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) expression , we used IL-2 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs and IL-2-secreting Jurkat T cells as a model system .
Transient expression of HIV-1 Tat induced a five- to eightfold increase in IL-2 promoter activity in Jurkat T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate .
IL-2 secretion was increased more than twofold in both Jurkat T cells and primary T cells stimulated by extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein .
Analysis of mRNA suggested that Tat exerts its effect on IL-2 primarily at the transcriptional level .
The NF-B site at positions -206 to -195 of the IL-2 promoter was required but not sufficient for the Tat effect .
The Tat-mediated increase in IL-2 promoter activity could selectively be blocked by antisense tat or-unlike the analogous effect of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax-by cyclosporin A .
The observed increase in IL-2 levels might facilitate virus spread from or to T cells .
Furthermore , it might contribute to the hypergammaglobulinemia or , together with other cytokines found to be dysregulated , the T-helper cell dysfunctions observed in AIDS patients .
Transactivation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) gene expression by HIV-1 Tat nuclear protein has previously been described in detail ( 10 , 12 ) .
Tat binds to a pyrimidine bulge in the stem-loop of the transactivation response ( TAR ) RNA structure found at the 5 ' end of all HIV-1 mRNAs .
Furthermore , cellular proteins and transcription factors are required for efficient gene expression from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and interact with Tat ( 21 , 49 ) .
Recent data suggest that Tat acts as a processivity factor and promotes RNA transcript elongation ( 16 ) , although augmentation of transcript initiation has also been suggested ( 25 ) .
According to the model of Cullen ( 11 ) , Tat has no direct effect on the processivity of transcription complexes that initiate at the HIV-1 LTR .
Instead , it may simply activate initiation of transcription from an HIV-1 LTR promoter that is intrinsically elongation competent .
Thus , activation of transcript initiation may be masked as enhanced elongation .
Recent evidence suggests that Tat may mediate additional activities regarding cell growth and function .
Thus , Tat was found to stimulate growth of Kaposi 's sarcoma cells ( 14 , 15 ) and caused Kaposi 's sarcoma-like dermal lesions in some tat-transgenic mice ( 62 ) .
Moreover , Tat was reported to suppress antigen-induced but not phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) induced proliferation of T cells ( 61 ) .
The tax gene product of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is a functional analog of Tat and transactivates viral gene expression ( 17 ) .
In addition , Tax activates cellular gene expression ( 63 ) , including expression of genes like the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , the transforming growth factor B ( TGF-B ) , and the IL-2 receptor genes ( 9 , 31 , 53 ) .
Recent studies suggest that Tat , like Tax , also transactivates cellular genes , e.g .
, genes of the cytokines TGF-B ( 36 ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) ( 4 ) , and IL-6 .
Repression of gene expression by Tat has also been demon * Corresponding author .

Tat is secreted from HIV-1-infected or fat-trans-fected cells and can be immunoprecipitated from the supernatant of such cells ( 15 , 19 ) .
Exogenous Tat is readily endocy-tosed and targeted to the nucleus of cells ( 38 ) .
Collectively , these observations suggest that Tat may activate expression of cellular genes in infected and noninfected cells and therefore contribute to the cytokine dysregulation observed in the course of an HIV-1 infection ( 6 ) .
IL-2 has a pivotal role in the immune response .
Originally described as a T-cell growth factor ( 40 ) , IL-2 is known to have direct effects on growth and differentiation of T and B lym-phocytes , natural killer cells , lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) cells , monocytes , macrophages , and oligodendrocytes ( 39 ) .
Therefore , dysregulation of IL-2 expression by Tat may have important consequences on the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection .
In this study , we describe the use of IL-2 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) constructs and IL-2-secreting Jurkat T cells as a model system and report that endogenous and exogenous Tat enhance IL-2 expression in activated T cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and culture conditions .
Jurkat T cells and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 50 pug of gentamycin per ml , 6 mM HEPES ( N-2'-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid ) , and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % carbon dioxide in air .
A HeLa cell line stably expressing HIV-1 Tat ( 60 ) , kindly provided by K. Valerie ( Smith , Kline and French Laboratories , King of Prussia , Pa. ) , was used for cocultures .
Preparation of peripheral T cells .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood by Ficoll ( Biochrom , Berlin , Federal Republic of Germany ) density gradient centrifugation .
Cells were washed twice 4178 WESTENDORP ET AL .
with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , and adherent cells were removed by incubation in supplemented medium for 1 h at 37°C .
CD19* cells were depleted with the MACS magnetic microbead system ( Miltenyi Biotech , Bergisch Gladbach , Federal Republic of Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Purity was > 99 % as assessed by cytoffluorometry with an anti-CD2 antibody ( clone 39C1.5 ; Immunotech , Mar-seilles , France ) .
Ten nanograms of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) ( Sigma , Deisenhofen , Federal Republic of Germany ) per milliliter and 5 ug of PHA ( Sigma ) per mi were used for mitogen stimulation of the cells .
Recombinant plasmids .
The HindIII fragment of pIL-2/ CAT ( 52 ) containing the complete IL-2 promoter-enhancer region from positions -575 to +47 was inserted into the HindIII site of pBLCAT3 ( 37 ) in both orientations to yield pIL-2/CAT and pIL-2/CAT- , respectively .
The HIV-1 expression vector pEXCMV-Tat contained the tat cDNA from pCV1 ( 1 ) under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter , the simian virus 40 splice signal sequence ( positions 4710 to 4100 ) , and the polyadenylation signal ( positions 2770 to 2533 ) .
The HIV-1 LTR was cloned as a Xhol-HindIlI fragment of the HIV-1 cDNA clone C15 into pSVIXCAT ( 55 ) to yield pHIV-1 LTR/CAT .
pRK was used for expression of HTLV-I Tax , and pHTLV-I/CAT was used as a reporter construct .
The plasmid containing four copies of the NF- « B binding sequence from the immunoglobulin kappa light-chain enhancer was generated by ligation of the synthesized NF-kB binding sequence 5¢-CAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGC-3 ' ( 34 ) into the polylinker site of pBLCAT2 ( 37 ) .
A construct containing five copies of the sequence GATTITTCACCTAAATC-3 ' ( positions -215 to -191 of the IL-2 promoter ) inserted in pBLCAT2 was obtained from E. Serfling , University of Wiirzburg , Wiirzburg , Federal Republic of Germany ( 5xTCEd [ 50 ] ) .
The antisense-fat expression construct ( pAS-tat ) pAR6 and the antisense-HIV-1 gag plasmid ( pAS-gag ) pAR2 ( 45 ) are pKEX derivatives ( 46 ) .
Transfection experiments .
Plasmid DNA was transfected into Jurkat T cells by the DEAE-dextran method as described by Gorman ( 22 ) .
Briefly , 1.5 % 10 `` cells were incubated with a total of 15 ug of plasmid DNA in 500 pug of DEAE-dextran and 20 ug of chloroquine per ml for 30 min .
For stimulation , cultures were treated with 10 ng of PMA ( Sigma ) per ml and 5 ug of PHA ( Sigma ) per ml .
Approximately 40 h after transfection , the clarified lysates were assayed for CAT activity ( 22 ) by using an automatic thin-layer chromatography linear analyzer ( Berthold , Wildbad , Federal Republic of Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
All percent conversion values were corrected for differences in total protein concentration among samples by using the Bio-Rad protein assay system .
Mutations of the IL-2 promoter .
Mutants with deletions of the 5 end of the IL-2 promoter were synthesized by PCR according to standard protocols ( 29 ) with primers containing a HindIII or a BamHI restriction site .
The resulting PCR products were HindIII-BamHI digested and cloned into pBLCAT3 .
An NF-kB point mutation of the IL-2 promoter was synthesized by thermal cycle fusion PCR ( 29 ) .
The oligonucleotide primers TCACCTACATCC-3 ' and 5-GGATGTAGGTGAAATAAA TCTTITGTTACATTAGC-3 ' were used to introduce a -204GGG-to-TTT base substitution within the NF- « B binding motif .
The integrity of all IL-2 promoter mutants was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing .
Primer extension analysis .
Primer extension analysis was based on the method described by Contente et al .
( 8 ) .
Briefly , poly ( A ) RNA ( 3 pug ) was isolated from Jurkat T cells J. ViroL .
transiently cotransfected with pIL-2/CAT and ptat or pIL-2/ CAT alone .
The RNA was incubated with 0.5 to 0.9 ng of -labeled oligonucleotide primer ( binding close to the 5 ' end of the CAT coding region ) in 900 mM NaCl-150 mM HEPES ( pH 7.6 ) -0.3 mM EDTA for 10 min at 68°C and then for 2 h at 30°C .
The annealed primer was then precipitated with ethanol ; resuspended in 20 wl of 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.3 ) -75 mM KCI-3 mM MgCl ; -10 mM dithiothreitol-1 mM each dATP , dCTP , dGTP , and dTTP-1 U of RNasin ( Serva , Heidelberg , Federal Republic of Germany ) per pl-50 pg of RNase A per ml-25 mM EDTA for 30 min at 37°C ; extracted with phenol-chloroform ( 1:1 , vol/vol ) ; ethanol precipitated ; and run on a 6 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel beside a DNA sequencing ladder .
Anti-HIV-1 Tat serum .
Synthesis of full-length HIV-1 Tat ( 86 amino acids ; HIV-1 strain BL16 ) will be described in detail elsewhere ( 18a ) .
Anti-HIV-1 Tat serum against chemically synthesized Tat ( sTat ) was raised in rabbits .
Rabbits were immunized six times with 150 mg of sTat at 3- to 4-week intervals .
The specific anti-Tat activity was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
Briefly , 96-well Micro-Test plates ( Becton-Dickinson , Oxnard , Calif. ) were coated with 1 ug of sTat per ml or bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) as a control at 4°C overnight .
Free sites on the plates were blocked with 1X PBS and 5 % BSA for 1 h at room temperature .
Plates were washed three times with 1 % PBS-0.05 % Nonidet P-40 , incubated with anti-Tat or control serum for 90 min at room temperature , washed as described above , incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody ( Dianova , Hamburg , Federal Republic of Germany ) for 90 min at room temperature , washed as described above , and developed with 0.1 M Na , HPO , -0.05 M citric acid-1.5 mg of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride per ml-0.03 % H ; ,0 ; , for 10 min in the dark .
Tat-containing supernatants were preincu-bated with anti-Tat or control serum for 2 h at 37°C to neutralize HIV-1 Tat .
Northern ( RNA ) blotting and quantification of IL-2 .
Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from Jurkat T cells by using the Nonidet P-40 lysis method described by Gough ( 23 ) .
Oligo ( dT ) cellulose chromatography ( QuickPrep ; Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) was used to purify poly ( A ) * RNA .
RNA was quantified by UV absorption at 260 nm .
A 10-ug amount of poly ( A ) * RNA was electrophoresed in 1.0 % agarose containing formaldehyde and morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ( MOPS ) and blotted onto a nylon membrane as previously described ( 35 ) .
For hybridization ( 47 ) , probes for B-actin ( 7 ) and IL-2 ( 56 ) were labeled by the 3'-end-labeling system ( Boehringer , Mannheim , Federal Republic of Germany ) .
IL-2 was assayed by a human IL-2 ELISA ( Hoffmann-LaRoche , Basel , Switzerland ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
RESULTS Effect of HIV-1 Tat on the IL-2 promoter .
To examine the effect of HIV-1 Tat on IL-2 expression at the transcriptional level , a tat cDNA expression vector ( ptat ) and the reporter gene construct pIL-2/CAT were cotransfected into Jurkat T cells and CAT expression was measured .
Figure 1 shows that the activity of the IL-2 promoter in pIL-2/CAT was stimulated with PHA and PMA like the endogenous IL-2 gene .
However , in the presence of tat expression and not in the presence of the expression vector lacking tat cDNA , IL-2 promoter activity was enhanced five- to eightfold .
Mitogen ( PHA and PMA ) stimulation was required for this effect ( Fig .
1 , black bars ) .
Similar results were obtained when the mouse IL-2 promoter instead VoL .

4B ) .
Furthermore , cotransfection with a reporter gene construct carrying the IL-2 promoter cassette in the opposite orientation only resulted in background CAT activity ( data not shown ) .
HIV-1 Tat might activate transcription from unusual initiation sites within the IL-2 promoter .
Therefore , we performed primer extension analysis to map the RNA 5 ' end .
The results shown in Fig .
2 confirmed a correctly initiated , IL-2 promoter-driven transcription of the CAT gene from pIL-2/CAT in the absence and presence of Tat .
Thus , HIV-1 Tat stimulates transcription from the previously described initiation site at position +1 of the IL-2 promoter ( 52 ) .

Selective blocking of the effect of Tat on the IL-2 promoter .
Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with pIL-2/CAT alone ( - ) or cotransfected with the indicated combinations of ptat , a pKEX-based antisense RNA expression construct for fat ( pAS-tat ) , gag ( pAS-gag ) , or the pKEX vector itself as a control .
All transfectants were stimulated with PHA and PMA as described in Materials and Methods .
The IL-2 promoter activity was measured as percent transacetylation , and the values are representative of three independent transfections ; variation was less than 14 % .
independent proof that the observed augmentation of IL-2 promoter activity was mediated by Tat , we tried to selectively block the effect .
Cotransfection of equal amounts of ptat and pAS-tat , expressing antisense-fot RNA , selectively reduced IL-2 promoter activity to the level of activity observed with PHA and PMA stimulation in the absence of Tat ( Fig .
3 ) .
Therefore , the effect of Tat on IL-2 promoter activity was blocked without affecting the basal promoter activity after mitogen stimulation .
Two further controls were included to rule out the possibility of promoter interference between the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoters of the expression vectors or an unspecific effect of antisense RNA on IL-2 promoter activity .
Neither cotransfection of pKEX , the parent vector of pAS-tat , nor pKEX expressing antisense-gag RNA ( 45 ) had a significant effect on IL-2 promoter activity in the presence or absence of Tat .
Taken together , these data support the interpretation that fat antisense RNA selectively blocks Tat activity .
The transactivator protein of HTLV-I , termed Tax , has been shown to synergize with mitogenic stimuli like PHA and PMA in activating IL-2 gene expression ( 53 ) and to circumvent the inhibitory effects of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) on the IL-2 promoter ( 51 , 53 ) .
We observed a two- to threefold CsA-resistant activation of IL-2 promoter activity in PHA-PMA-stimulated Jurkat T cells by HTLV-I Tax ( Fig .
4A ) .
These results are in accordance with previously published data ( 53 ) .
In contrast , CsA treatment of Jurkat T cells cotransfected with pIL-2/CAT and ptat completely blocked IL-2 promoter activity .
Activity of the B-actin promoter , included as a control to rule out possible toxic effects of CsA , was not affected ( Fig .
4B ) .
Effect of HIV-1 Tat and HTLV-I Tax on NF-KB activity .
To test the assumption that transactivation of the IL-2 promoter by Tat and Tax may follow different mechanisms , we compared the effects of HIV-1 Tat and HTLV-I Tax on NF-kB activity , known to be increased by Tax ( 35 ) .
Thus , we tested the effects of Tax and Tat on the activity of a reporter gene construct carrying four copies of the NF- « B binding motif from the immunoglobulin kappa light-chain enhancer ( « x enhancer [ 34 ] ) in front of the CAT gene in transiently transfected Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
5A ) .
As expected , both mitogen stimulation and Tax resulted in a substantial increase of NF- « B activity .

The promoter activity was measured as percent transacetylation .
The average values and standard deviations ( error bars ) for three independent transfections are shown .
- , cells transfected with pIL-2/CAT alone .
more , a combination of PHA and PMA and Tax had a much stronger effect on activity than Tax or mitogen stimulation alone .
However , no effect of Tat on NF-kB activity was detected .
Transactivation of the IL-2 promoter by Tat requires mitogen stimulation of the cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
We therefore stimulated transfected Jurkat T cells with PHA and PMA to investigate the possibility of synergistic effects of mitogen stimulation and Tat ( or Tax ) on NF- « B activity .
As shown in Fig .
5A , Tat did not synergize with PHA and PMA to increase NF- « B activity .
The NF- « B binding sequences in the immunoglobulin kappa light-chain enhancer and the IL-2 enhancer differ slightly ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Therefore , we tested a reporter gene construct carrying four copies of the NF-kB motif from the IL-2 promoter ( Fig .
5B ) .
Again , no effect of Tat on NF- « B activity was observed in unstimulated and PHA-PMA-stimulated Jurkat T cells .
To validate these results in the context of the intact IL-2 promoter , we generated an NF-kB point mutation shown previously to abolish NF-kB binding ( 2 ) .
Both the wild type J. ViroL .
and the mutated IL-2 promoter construct were tested with PHA-PMA-stimulated Jurkat T cells transiently cotransfected with ptat ( Fig .
6 , upper two bars ) .
Interestingly , the NF- « B mutation abolished the ability of HIV-1 Tat to transactivate the IL-2 promoter .
Therefore , the NF-KB site at positions -206 to -195 of the IL-2 promoter is necessary but-as judged from the multimerized NF-KB reporter constructs ( Fig .
5 ) -not sufficient for transactivation by HIV-1 Tat .
Apart from the NF- « B motif , the IL-2 promoter contains various sites that bind proteins believed to contribute to transcriptional control , including those for NF-AT , AP-1 , Oct-1/2 , CD28RC , and others ( 20 , 48 ) .
These sites within the IL-2 promoter have previously been grouped into five functional boxes ( 48 ) .
On the basis of this division , we constructed a series of 5° deletion mutants and cloned them into pBLCAT3 .
The ability of Tat to transactivate the truncated promoter constructs was tested by transient cotransfection of Jurkat T cells as described above .
As shown in Fig .
6 , deletion of the 5 ' region of the IL-2 promoter to position -208 did not affect Tat transactivation , though PHA and PMA stimulation was reduced ( Fig .
6 legend ) .
Therefore , neither the previously described NF-AT site ( positions -286 to -257 ) , the Oct-1/2 site ( positions -256 to -242 ) , nor any potential unknown binding motif upstream of position -208 is required for Tat transactivation of the IL-2 promoter .
In contrast , further deletion of the sequence between positions ~208 and -158 abolished most of the Tat transactivation .
This part of the IL-2 promoter contains the AP-1 distal site ( positions -185 to -177 ) and the NF-KB site discussed above .
The results confirm the data obtained from the NF- « B point mutation ( see above ) and the important role of the NF-kB motif in transactivation of the IL-2 promoter by Tat .
Further 5 ' deletion of the IL-2 promoter resulted in loss of the residual Tat responsiveness .
However , this effect was only marginally significant and transacetylation rates obtained with the respective constructs were close to background levels .
In summary , the sequence between positions -208 and +51 of the IL-2 promoter is sufficient for transactivation by Tat and the NF-kB motif is a key element in this sequence .
Effect of exogenous Tat on the IL-2 promoter .
Tat secreted by one cell might be taken up by neighboring cells and exert its effect on IL-2 promoter activity of the latter cells .
Such mechanisms might be of particular importance in situations where infected Tat-producing T cells come into close contact with uninfected T cells , e.g .
, in lymphoid tissue of HIV-1-infected individuals .
To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the effect of HeLa cells stably transfected with tat ( HeLa-tat ) on pIL-2/CAT-transfected Jurkat T cells in cocultures .
The presence of native , biologically active Tat in the HeLa-tat cells and their supernatant was demonstrated by transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR after transfection of the HeLa cells with pLTR/ CAT or coculture with Jurkat T cells transfected with pLTR/ CAT ( Fig .
7A ) .
The observed transactivation level of pLTR/ CAT was generally much lower in unstimulated Jurkat T cells .
This might reflect a better uptake of Tat into activated Jurkat T cells .
In fact , an enhancing effect of PHA and PMA stimulation on the Tat-induced activity of LTR-driven CAT vector constructs has previously been described for Jurkat T cells ( 54 , 58 ) .
The observed transcellular transactivation of the IL-2 promoter might be either directly mediated by Tat or indirectly mediated via a cytokine secreted from HeLa-tat cells .
Therefore , we used rabbit serum raised against synthetic HIV-1 Tat to neutralize Tat activity in the supernatant of HeLa-tat cells .
Normal rabbit serum was used as a control .

IL-2 mRNA levels 20 h after stimulation were comparable in the absence and presence of Tat .
To investigate whether the effect of Tat on secretion of IL-2 could also be observed , we measured IL-2 in the supernatant of Jurkat T cells and purified peripheral T cells cultured in the presence or absence of exogenous Tat and stimulated with PHA and PMA for 15 h. Figure 10A shows that IL-2 in the supernatant of Jurkat T cells was increased more than twofold when Tat was present in the culture medium .

Results are representative of three independent experiments .

Upregulation of IL-2 secretion from activated Jurkat ( A ) and peripheral ( B ) T cells by exogenous Tat .
Jurkat T cells or purified peripheral T cells were cultured for 12 h in Tat-containing supernatant of HeLa-tat cells ( HT ) or supernatant of wild-type HeLa cells ( H ) as a control .
IL-2 secretion was measured 15 h after PHA and PMA stimulation by using an IL-2 ELISA .
The average values and standard deviations ( error bars ) for three independent experiments are shown .
Normal T cells and malignant Jurkat T cells differ in growth control and requirements for growth factors like IL-2 and IL-4 .
Therefore , we tested whether Tat also influences IL-2 secretion from activated normal peripheral T cells .
Figure 10B demonstrates the same significant enhancement of IL-2 secretion by Tat in activated normal peripheral T cells as observed in Jurkat T cells .
DISCUSSION The data presented in this paper show that HIV-1 Tat upregulates IL-2 gene expression and IL-2 secretion in activated Jurkat T cells and in freshly isolated activated peripheral T cells .
The effects of Tat on promoter activity , mRNA expression , and IL-2 secretion suggested that IL-2 upregulation was primarily caused at the transcriptional level .
Our experiments addressed the short-term effects of HIV-1 Tat on T cells .
The long-term effects of Tat on T cells , however , might be different .
Thus , in accordance with previous observations ( 43 ) , we also found decreased IL-2 expression in stable fat-transfected mitogen-activated Jurkat T cells ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , prolonged high-level expression of Tat in T cells might result in suppression rather than stimulation of IL-2 expression .
This suggests that the effects of Tat might depend on the duration of exposure of T cells to Tat .
Upregulation of IL-2 expression might therefore only be transient in stable Tat transfectants or in T cells of HIV-1-infected individuals .
This assumption is supported by our observation that IL-2 mRNA levels were strongly increased by Tat 4 h after mitogen stimulation and reached normal levels 16 h later .
The differential effects of Tat on IL-2 secretion of T cells , upregulation upon short-term exposure and downregulation upon long-term Vor .
68 , 1994 exposure , might also make detection of IL-2 levels in serum of HIV-1-infected individuals difficult ( 6 ) .
The mechanism of the Tat effect on IL-2 expression remains partly unclear .
Sequence comparison of the IL-2 RNA and TAR , the Tat-binding site of the HIV-1 LTR RNA , revealed no binding site for Tat on IL-2 RNA .
Recently , the presence of stem-loop structures containing the CUGGGA sequence downstream of the transcriptional start site of the TNF-B promoter has been suggested to play a role in Tat-induced TNF-B activation ( 4 ) .
Similar sequences forming TAR-like stem-loops have been identified downstream of the RNA initiation site of the JC virus promoter ( 5 , 44 ) .
However , no such sequences are present at the 5 ' end of IL-2 RNA .
Therefore , it is likely that transactivation of IL-2 expression by Tat represents a new TAR-independent mechanism of transcriptional activation .
However , the binding of Tat to a stem-loop structure , homologous to but distinct from TAR , at the 5 end of IL-2 RNA which might-as in the case of the HIV-1 LTR-tether Tat to the promoter can not completely be ruled out .
Comparison of HIV-1 Tat and the transactivator of a related human retrovirus , HTLV-I Tax , also known to synergize with mitogens to stimulate IL-2 expression ( 53 ) , revealed clear differences but also similarities in transactivation of the IL-2 promoter .
The effect of Tat was completely blocked with relatively low concentrations of the immunosuppressant CsA .
Tax , however , was shown to circumvent the effects of CsA ( Fig .
4 ) ( 51 , 53 ) .
Moreover , Tax , but not Tat , could transactivate a multimerized NF-kB binding motif .
However , both transacti-vators synergized with PHA and PMA stimulation of cells in transactivation of IL-2 gene expression .
Though the NF- « B binding sequence was not sufficient for transactivation by Tat , it was still required to confer Tat responsiveness to the IL-2 promoter .
Interestingly , the enhancer element of the HIV-1 LTR , composed of two NF-kB motifs ( 3 ) , and Tat are required for TAR-independent activation of HIV-1 gene expression in PMA-treated Jurkat T cells ( 24 ) and glial cells ( 57 ) .
Thus , Tat may be capable of interacting directly with certain « kB binding proteins present in activated T cells and glial cells and can associate with promoters independently of TAR ( 28 ) .
Tat transactivation of the IL-2 promoter is probably an important example of such a mechanism .
Our results suggest involvement of the NF- « xB element and at least one additional element downstream of position -208 ( Fig .
6 ) in transactivation of the IL-2 promoter by Tat .
Possible elements downstream of this position include NF-AT , AP-1 , OAP , Oct-1/2 , and CD28RC .
Of these , NF-AT-1 , AP-1 ( 41 ) , and OAP ( 59 ) have been described to be CsA sensitive .
The sensitivity of these elements would provide an explanation for blocking of the Tat but not the Tax effect by the immunosuppressant .
Further mutational analysis of the IL-2 promoter is necessary to identify additional requirements of Tat transactivation and elements interacting with Tat .
Thus , an influence of Tat on the activity of specific transcription factors or regulatory elements has recently been described for the murine cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter ( 32 ) .
Furthermore , a direct ( 27 ) and functional ( 30 ) interaction of Tat and the transcription factor Spl has been demonstrated for the HIV-1 LTR .
Intracellular expression of Tat in transfected Jurkat T cells may not correctly represent the pathological situation for AIDS .
Consequently , its biological significance may be difficult to interpret .
Therefore , it is particularly significant that the results presented here are not restricted to intracellular Tat .
Extracellular Tat , secreted by Tat-producing cells , was taken up by neighboring T cells and transactivated IL-2 expression after mitogen stimulation .
This effect could specifically be blocked with anti-Tat antibodies .
In our experiments , endog- HIV-1 Tat UPREGULATES IL-2 EXPRESSION 4183 enous Tat evoked a much stronger increase in IL-2 promoter activity than did exogenous Tat ( a five- to eightfold versus a two- to threefold increase ) .
This difference is most likely explained by a lower concentration of secreted ( exogenous ) Tat in the culture medium .
Thus , exposure of cells to exogenous Tat may yield lower intracellular concentrations of Tat than does Tat expression within the cell .
In accordance , concentration dependence of Tat effects has recently been demonstrated for purified recombinant Tat ( 15 ) .
In vivo , Tat may be concentrated in lymphoid tissue at sites where HIV-1 replication is most active during the clinically latent period of HIV-1 infection ( 13 , 42 ) .
In addition , close contact of cells at such sites might make uptake of Tat by surrounding noninfected T cells particularly efficient .
This effect may therefore exceed the effect observed with our cell cultures .
In conclusion , we suggest that Tat produced and secreted by infected lymphocytes or macrophages in the lymphoid tissue is taken up by surrounding noninfected T cells and influences their IL-2 production .
Ensuing fluctuations of IL-2 levels in the lymphoid microenvironment might then severely influence T-cell function in HIV-1 infection .
T-cell activation is known to be required for efficient virus propagation .
Therefore , increased IL-2 levels might enhance viral replication and virus spread .
In addition , increased IL-2 levels are in accordance with and might help to explain the high frequency of activated T cells and follicular hyperplasia and a high rate of viral replication observed in lymphoid tissue early in the course of HIV-1 infection ( 42 ) .
HIV-1 Tat-mediated dysregulation of IL-2 and possibly other inflammatory cytokines ( 4 ) might contribute to the apparent immuno-logic dysfunction observed in AIDS patients , or to the development of Kaposi 's sarcoma ( 14 , 15 ) .
Moreover , an increase in IL-2 levels caused by Tat might be a factor that contributes to the hypergammaglobulinemia described in connection with AIDS ( 33 ) .
Further studies are necessary to clarify the physiologic role of transactivation of IL-2 expression in activated T cells in HIV-1 infection and to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the action of Tat on cellular gene expression .
