9 DNA-Binding and Transcriptional Regulatory Properties of Hepatic Leukemia Factor ( HLF ) and the t ( 17 ; 19 ) Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Chimera E2A-HLF STEPHEN P. HUNGER , ROXANE BROWN , ano MICHAEL L. CLEARY* Laboratory of Experimental Oncology , Department of Pathology , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California 94305 Received 27 January 1994/Returned for modification 24 March 1994/Accepted 6 June 1994 The t ( 17 ; 19 ) translocation in acute lymphoblastic leukemias results in creation of E2A-hepatic leukemia factor ( HLF ) chimeric proteins that contain the DNA-binding and protein dimerization domains of the basic leucine zipper ( bZIP ) protein HLF fused to a portion of E2A proteins with transcriptional activation properties .
An in vitro binding site selection procedure was used to determine DNA sequences preferentially bound by wild-type HLF and chimeric E2A-HLF proteins isolated from various t ( 17 ; 19 ) -bearing leukemias .
All were found to selectively bind the consensus sequence 5-GTTACGTAAT-3 ' with high affinity .
Wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins also bound closely related sites identified previously for bZIP proteins of both the proline- and acidic amino acid-rich ( PAR ) and C/EBP subfamilies ; however , E2A-HLF proteins were significantly less tolerant of certain deviations from the HLF consensus binding site .
These differences were directly attributable to loss of an HLF ancillary DNA-binding domain in all E2A-HLF chimeras and were further exacerbated by a zipper mutation in one isolate .
Both wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins displayed transcriptional activator properties in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells on reporter genes containing HLF or C/EBP consensus binding sites .
But on reporter genes with nonoptimal binding sites , their transcriptional properties diverged and E2A-HLF competitively inhibited activation by wild-type PAR proteins .
These findings establish a spectrum of binding site-specific transcriptional properties for E2A-HLF which may preferentially activate expression of select subordinate genes as a homodimer and potentially antagonize expression of others through heteromeric interactions .
Homeostatic control of gene expression at the level of mRNA transcription is essential for normal cellular growth and differentiation ( 37 ) .
A remarkably wide range of diverse cellular proteins known as transcription factors has been implicated in this process .
One major subfamily of transcription factors , the basic leucine zipper ( bZIP ) proteins , is characterized by the presence of a highly charged basic region responsible for DNA binding and an adjacent amphipathic a helical domain termed the leucine zipper that mediates protein dimerization ( 34 ) .
In addition to playing important roles in control of normal growth and differentiation , specific bZIP proteins have been implicated in malignant transformation .
Fos and Jun , which heterodimerize to form the transcription factor AP-1 , were originally identified as oncogenes trans-duced by transforming retroviruses ( for a review , see reference 10 ) .
In addition , a chicken homolog of C/EBPB , NF-M , has been implicated in the development of avian myelogeneous leukemia ( 5 , 20 ) .
More recently , chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias ( 6 ) and solid tumors ( 3 , 9 , 24 , 31 , 38 ) have been shown to oncogenically activate various transcriptional proteins , including members of the bZIP family .
For example , in human myxoid liposarcoma , the t ( 12 ; 16 ) translocation creates a protein chimera composed of the dominant negative C/EBP-like protein CHOP fused to a portion of a novel protein referred to as TLS ( 9 ) or FUS ( 31 ) .

5986 soft parts , fuses the ATF-1 gene to EWS , which was previously identified on the basis of its involvement in the t ( 11 ; 22 ) translocation in Ewing 's sarcoma ( 38 ) .
Thus , structural alterations of bZIP proteins are a recurring theme in oncogenesis ; however , the effects on their transcriptional regulatory properties remain undefined .
We and others have reported that a chimeric bZIP protein called EZ2A-hepatic leukemia factor ( HLF ) is created by the t ( 17 ; 19 ) ( q21-q22 ; p13 ) translocation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) ( 15 , 16 ) .
E2A-HLF chimeras consist of the amino-terminal two-thirds of E2A proteins , including two regions with transcriptional activation properties ( 2 , 30 ) , fused to the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of HLF , a previously unknown bZIP protein .
HLF was shown to be closely related to bZIP proteins DBP ( 27 ) and TEF/VBP ( 11 , 17 ) , which comprise a distinct subgroup ( the proline- and acidic amino acid-rich [ PAR ] subfamily ) distinguished both structurally and functionally from the larger bZIP protein superfamily ( 11 ) .
These characteristic bZIP proteins have been implicated in the regulation of genes that display a tissue-restricted or developmental stage-specific expression profile , particularly in mature hepatocytes ( DBP and VBP ) or developing thyrotrophs ( TEF ) in the embryonic pituitary ( 11 , 17 , 21 , 27 , 35 , 36 ) .
Similar to PAR and several other bZIP proteins , HLF expression is restricted in adult and fetal tissues ( primar-ily liver , kidney , and lung ) , suggesting that it also plays a role in cell-type-specific transcription ( 15 , 16 ) .
Notably , HLF is not expressed in normal or malignant hematolymphoid cells , suggesting that its redirected expression by chromosomal translocations in immature lymphoid cells is an important pathoge-netic event .
In earlier studies , wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins were VoL .
14 , 1994 demonstrated to cross-bind to a TEF recognition site present in the rat growth hormone ( GH ) promoter ( 15 ) .
Binding was observed as homodimers or heterodimeric complexes with the related PAR proteins DBP and TEF .
It was noted that DNA binding to the TEF GH site was measurably poorer by E2A-HLF compared with wild-type HLF , and a zipper mutation in EZA-HLF further exacerbated this difference .
Since DNA binding by E2A-HLF heterodimers was less impaired , these findings suggested the intriguing possibility that chimeric HLF proteins could participate in heterodimeric interactions with other bZIP proteins in addition to a potential role as homodimeric transcription factors .
More recently , the chimeric products from additional t ( 17 ; 19 ) -ALLs have been characterized ( 13 , 16 ) .
These studies show that all E2A-HLF chimeras include the same portion of HLF containing its basic and leucine zipper motifs and that somatic mutations of the zipper are not a general feature .
However , amino acids juxtaposed with the HLF basic region , either from EZ2A or from random insertions of nontemplated nucleotides , can vary from one leukemia to another because of diverse genomic rearrangements underlying the t ( 17 ; 19 ) translocation .
The variable structural features of different E2A-HLF chimeras suggested that their DNA-binding and transcriptional properties might be heterogeneous , particularly since the sites of protein fusion occurred within or adjacent to the regions implicated in protein-DNA interactions ( i.e .
, the basic region ) .
The current studies were undertaken to further characterize and establish the structural basis for differences observed previously in the DNA-binding capability of E2A-HLF and to establish their potential role in determining or restricting the transcriptional properties of the chimeric proteins .
Using an in vitro binding site selection assay , we identified an identical dyad symmetric core consensus sequence to which both HLF and various E2A-HLF chimeras bound avidly .
HLF and E2A-HLF also bound well to closely related sites , but altered binding to certain divergent sites was a consistent feature of E2A-HLF proteins and was directly attributable to loss of an HLF ancillary DNA-binding domain .
In both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells , HLF and E2A-HLF functioned experimentally as transcriptional activators of reporter genes containing a minimal promoter with adjacent HLF consensus binding sites or high affinity C/EBP sites , although their transcriptional properties diverged on reporters containing less-optimal sites .
Thus , despite their altered DNA-binding properties , chimeric E2A-HLF proteins can function as transcriptional activators whose leukemogenic properties are likely mediated by dys-regulation of target genes normally regulated by related bZIP proteins .
MATERIALS AND METHODS EMSAs and consensus binding site selection .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were performed as described previously ( 15 ) with proteins translated in vitro ( IVT ) from expression plasmids , using a coupled reticulocyte lysate system ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) .
In vitro translates from reactions programmed with vector ( pSP64 ) alone served as negative controls for EMSA .
To ensure that approximately equal amounts of IVT protein were present in binding reaction mixtures , 1/10 of each reaction mixture was translated in parallel with [ °°SJmethionine .
Labelled proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis and quantitated on a phosphoimager , and values were normalized to the number of methionine residues ; these results were used to standardize the relative amounts of unlabelled translation mixtures added to each binding reaction TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATORY PROPERTIES OF E2A-HLF 5987 mixture .
Oligonucleotides containing all binding sites ( see Table 1 for sequences ) shared an identical backbone derived from the VBP site in the chicken vitellogenin II ( VTG II ) promoter ( 17 ) .
Single-stranded oligonucleotides CAAAAAGAGGAGT ( ® ) , , CCTGATAAAAAAG-3 ' and 5'-GATCCTTTTITTATCAGG ( Y ) , ACTCCTCTTTTTGA-3 ' , where X and Y represent complementary nucleotides of the binding site of interest ] were annealed and labelled by Klenow fill-in .
For several nondyad symmetric sites the 10-nucleotide binding site core was analyzed in both orientations with respect to the backbone ; no differences in binding were observed .
A modification of the selective amplification and binding ( SAAB ) assay ( 4 ) was used to determine the consensus HLF binding site .
A single-stranded oligonucleotide containing 20 internal degenerate positions [ STI , 5-GAGGATCCAGTC AGCATG- ( N ) ; , -CTCAGCCTCGAGATCTCG-3 ' ] was annealed to an oligonucleotide primer complementary to the 3 ' arm ( STI-D , 5-CGAGATCTCGAGGCTGAG-3 ' ) and converted to double-stranded DNA with unlabelled nucleotides .
The resultant double-stranded STI DNA was end labelled with using T4 polynucleotide kinase , and 0.15 nmol was used in binding reactions with IVT HLF .
A faint shifted complex was observed in the HLF binding reaction but not in the negative control IVT ( see Fig .
1 ) .
The area of the gel corresponding to this complex was excised , and the DNA was eluted in H , O .
Approximately 10 % of the eluate was amplified by PCR with ST1-D and an oligomer homologous to the 5 arm of ST1 ( ST1I-U , 5-GAGGATCCAGTCAGCATG-3 ' ) .
The amplification was performed as described previously ( 14 ) for 15 to 30 cycles with annealing at 52°C .
The amplification product of the selected probe was end labelled , and approximately 1 % was used for a subsequent round of selection .
After five rounds of SAAB , the amplified product was digested with BamHI and Bg/lI to cleave sites present in the STI arms and cloned into pBluescript ( Stratagene , San Diego , Calif. ) .
Nucleotide sequences of independent clones were determined by using commercially prepared reagents ( Sequenase ; U.S. Bio-chemicals , Cleveland , Ohio ) and visually aligned .
Only sequences derived entirely from the internal degenerate positions were used to determine the consensus binding site .
Consensus binding sites for various EZA-HLF proteins were determined in an identical manner , with the exception that six , rather than five , rounds of SAAB were employed .
Plasmid constructions .
The in vitro expression plasmids pHLF , pHLF `` , pHLFAN® `` `` ° , pE2A-HLF ' , and pE2A-HLF have been described previously ( 15 ) .
In this report we use the terminology EH** `` ° to refer to the e13-Ins-e4 spliced protein isolated from the HAL-O01 cell line which contains an 1-526-to-F-526 somatic mutation and EH*° to refer to a protein in which this position has been reverted to the wild-type isoleucine residue .
Various expression plasmids were modified by standard PCR and cloning procedures to create additional constructs for in vitro expression of modified wild-type or fusion proteins .
EHU ( a plasmid that expresses an e13-Ins-e4 spliced fusion protein which contains an insertion different from that in the HAL-01 chimera ) was constructed by amplifying the 3 ' portion of the fusion cDNA from the UOC-B1 t ( 17 ; 19 ) -ALL cell line ( 16 ) with an oligomer homologous to sequences in £24 exon 11 ( JN3 , 5-CGTCCAGC CCTTCTACCC-3 ' ) and an oligomer complementary to HLF exon 4 sequences 3 ' of the stop codon which contained an artificial EcoRI site ( HLF 3'Eco , 5-GCGAATTCAGCCAG CCTGCAAAAATGCC-3 ' ) .
The PCR product was digested with Xhol ( a natural Xhol site is present in £24 exon 11 ) and EcoRI and used to replace the corresponding Xhol-EcoRI fragment of pEH ' `` .
An identical strategy was employed to 5988 HUNGER ET AL .
construct the expression plasmid pEH** `` * derived from a t ( 17 ; 19 ) -ALL with an e12-e4 spliced mRNA ( 13 ) .
Two additional truncation mutants of HLF were used in these studies : HLF `` , which contains only the portion of HLF ( residues 225 to 295 , encoded by exon 4 ) present in the EZ2A-HLF fusion protein preceded by a methionine residue , and HLF® ' `` `` ° ( residues 210 to 295 ) , which includes 15 additional amino acids which compose the so-called basic region extension ( BRE ) .
These were constructed by PCR with primer HLF 3'Eco and specific upstream primers which contained artificial BamHI sites for cloning purposes ( HE4 Met-Bam , 5-GCGGATCC GCGATGGATGACAAGTACTGGGCAAGG-3 ' , and HBE Met-Bam , GCAAA-3 ' ) .
Amplification products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the pSP64 e 1gression plasmid .
The artificial fusion protein construct EH `` * `` contained HLF residues comprising the PAR and BRE in addition to HLF exon 4-encoded sequences ( amino acids 158 to 295 ) , essentially the same portion of HLF found in HLF `` .
Plasmid pEH ' `` **° was amplified with JN3 and a downstream oligomer complementary to the 3 ' end of the insertion with a 3 ' BamHI overhang ( INSENDBAM , 5-CGCGGATCCCACCAGAAA TCTCAGGCG-3 ' ) , cut with Xhol and BamHI and ligated into the Xhol- and EcoRI-cut pEH-I vector along with a portion of wild-type pHLF ' amplified with HLF 3'Eco and an upstream oligomer with a 5 BamHI overhang ( HLFPARBAM , 5-GCG GATCCCGCAATACACCAAGTCCC-3 ' ) .
The construct assembled in this manner includes E2A residues 1 to 477 , the HAL-01-derived insertion , two residues inserted by the cloning process ( glycine and serine ) , and HLF residues 158 to 295 .
EH®* `` * `` , which contains residues 1 to 524 of E2A-HLF with an artificial stop codon immediately preceding the HLF leucine zipper , was constructed by replacing the Xhol-EcoRI fragment of pEH `` ° with a fragment generated by amplifying with oligomers JN3 and HDZ ( 5¢-CCGGAATTCGAACTA GTTCTCTTTCAGCCTCC-3 ' ) .
The amplified portions of all constructs were sequenced to ensure that no PCR-induced mutations had occurred .
Transient transfections and transcriptional activation assays .
For transfection experiments the coding portions of various in vitro expression plasmids were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV1 .
The expression vector pET3aTEF ( 11 ) was used to express rat TEF in dominant negative experiments .
The pCMV1 vector without transactivator insert served as a negative control .
Reporter constructs were assembled by digesting double-stranded oligonucleotide binding sites at BamHI and Bg/l sites present in the invariant portions and concatamerizing and cloning them into the pBLCAT2 ( 23 ) vector adjacent to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter which drives expression of a chloramphenicol acetyitransferase ( CAT ) gene .
A CAT reporter driven by the liver , bone , and kidney alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) promoter with eight VBP VTG II sites was a generous gift of John Birch ; for some experiments , the bank of VBP sites was excised and replaced by HLF consensus sites .
Nomenclature used indicates the type and number of copies of the binding site and promoter ; for example , ( HLF ) , -TK-CAT .
Transient transfections in monkey kidney-derived CV-1 cells were performed by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection as described previously ( 22 ) .
Human B-precursor ALL cell lines REH and 697 were transfected by electroporation with DEAE-dextran as described previously ( 22 ) .
The total amount of DNA transfected within each experiment was kept constant with the use of carrier plasmid DNA .
In each experiment a control plasmid expressing the luciferase gene ( pRSV-lucif-erase or pSVtk-luciferase ) was included to control for trans- Mor .

CAT and luciferase assays were performed as described ( 22 ) .
No significant CAT activity was detected in negative control experiments performed with various transac-tivators and reporter constructs lacking binding sites .
For each experiment , transfections were performed in duplicate on at least three separate occasions with similar results .
RESULTS HLF and E2A-HLF bind preferentially to an identical consensus DNA sequence .
An HLF consensus DNA-binding site was determined by a modified SAAB procedure ( 4 ) .
IVT HLF was incubated with an oligonucleotide ( ST1 ) containing 20 degenerate nucleotides flanked by PCR `` handles . ``
In the initial round of EMSA , using the fully degenerate ST 1 , a faint shifted complex was observed with HLF but not with control lysate proteins ( Fig .
1A ) .
With each successive round of selection this complex became more prominent ; after five rounds , an intense shifted complex was evident .
The DNA from this complex was amplified and cloned , and the nucleotide sequences of individual inserts were determined .
Comparison and alignment of 18 individual sequences showed an obvious consensus binding site : ( Fig .
1B ) .
There was no consensus outside these 10 positions .
This sequence was highly similar to binding sites previously identified for related PAR and C/EBP proteins-see Table 1 ( 7 , 11 , 17 , 27 , 34 , 36 ) .
There was a minor preference ( 39 % ) for C at the +2 position such that 6 of 36 half-sites matched the C/EBP high-affinity site ( ATTGC or GCAAT ) ( 34 ) ; this contrasted to 10 of 36 matches for the HLF consensus half-sites .
To confirm that this consensus sequence represented a high-affinity HLF-binding site , EMSA was performed with an oligonucleotide containing the consensus site with and without 100-fold excess unlabelled competitor DNAs ( Fig .
1C ) .
The HLF complex was fully inhibited by an excess of unlabelled HLF consensus site and unaffected by a 100-fold excess of an unrelated binding site for the PBX1 protein ( 22 ) .
Complete or near-complete competition was also observed with excess , unlabelled C/EBP site or the TEF GH site used in our earlier studies ( 15 ) .
The albumin D and VTG II sites ( which were used to clone DBP and VBP , respectively ) were effective , but less efficient , competitors .
Our previous observation that E2A-HLF bound less avidly than wild-type HLF to the TEF GH site ( 15 ) raised the possibility that the fusion protein might have a different optimal recognition sequence than HLF .
To address this , we performed the SAAB procedure with three different E2A-HLF chimeric proteins-the type I chimera ( EH* `` *°° ) isolated from the HAL-O1 cell line , a variant of this construct ( EH `` `` ° ) in which the zipper mutation was reverted to the wild-type sequence , and a type II E2A-HLF fusion protein ( Fig .
2 ) .
Following six rounds of SAAB , a total of 59 individual clones selected by the three E2A-HLF chimeras were sequenced .
Each of the three fusion proteins bound selectively to the same 5-GTTACGTAAT-3 ' consensus ( Fig .
3 ) as had HLF .
A total of 34 of 59 individual clones were either an exact match ( r = 11 ) or contained only one mismatch ( # = 23 ) from the 10-bp consensus .
In general , sequences selected by the fusion proteins displayed a tighter adherence to the consensus than wild-type HLF although an additional round of SAAB was employed for the fusion proteins .
The central 8-bp core of the consensus site ( -4 to +4 ) displays dyad symmetry , whereas flanking nucleotides at -5 and +5 are noncomplementary .
However , 44 % of the HLF-selected sites contained complementary nucleotides at these positions ( the same as between -2 and +2 [ Fig .
1 ] ) , as did VoL .

51 % of the E2A-HLF-selected sites ( data not shown ) , suggesting no strong selection against complementarity in individual clones .
Another obvious feature of the consensus is the pair of Ts at -4 and -3 flanked by purines and the complementary As at +3 and +4 flanked by pyrimidines , suggesting a strong bias against three or more consecutive purine or pyrimidine nucleotides in each half-site .
Whereas site selection for HLF did not reveal any consensus outside the 10-bp core , the fusion proteins displayed a trend toward a C in the +6 position and a strong selection against an A at -~7 .
The DNA-binding properties of E2A-HLF show site-specific TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATORY PROPERTIES OF E2A-HLF 5989 differences with HLF .
Potential differences in DNA binding by wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins ( Fig .
2 ) were investigated by EMSA .
The effect of the zipper mutation in one of the E2A-HLF proteins was assessed in constructs with or without this change ( EH*° `` ° versus EH `` `` `` ° ) and compared with analogous wild-type proteins ( HLF `` `` `` `` versus HLF ) .
Binding studies employed IVT proteins that were quantitated to ensure that approximately equal amounts were added to the binding reaction mixtures .
The binding sites were placed in the same oligonucleotide backbone to assess differences at positions which varied from the consensus ( Table 1 ) .
EMSA showed that DNA binding by each of the fusion proteins to the HLF consensus site was similar to that for HLF and the zipper mutation had little , if any , effect on binding by wild-type or fusion proteins ( Fig .
4 and Table 1 ) .
However , binding of E2A-HLF fusion proteins EH `` , and EH `` *~ to sites that deviated from the consensus varied from that of wild-type HLF in a manner that was binding site specific .
For example , HLF bound well to the C/EBP high-affinity and TEF GH sites but significantly less well to the VBP VTG II and DBP albumin D sites , in agreement with their relative abilities to compete for binding to the HLF consensus site ( Fig .
4 and Table 1 ) .
The chimeras , on the other hand , bound well to the C/EBP site but less well to the TEF GH site , and no consistent binding was detected to the VTG II and albumin D sites under these conditions .
The binding properties of the three chimeras were identical , indicating that the amino acid differences at their fusion sites did not have a significant effect on DNA binding .
Although binding of HLF to its consensus site was not significantly altered by a point mutation ( I-253 to F-253 ) in its leucine zipper , significant effects were observed on more divergent sites .
This mutation abolished binding to the VTGII and albumin D sites ( Fig .
4 and Table 1 ) .
Similarly , the same zipper mutation in the fusion protein ( EH* `` °* `` ° ) further exacerbated its decreased tolerance of deviation from the consensus binding site , since binding to the less divergent TEF GH and C/EBP sites was further impaired compared with that to EH `` **° .
It is notable that binding of wild-type and fusion proteins to the albumin D and VTG II sites was significantly different from that to the C/EBP high-affinity site , despite the fact that each matches the HLF consensus in 7 of 10 positions .
Comparison of the nucleotide composition of these sites suggested at least two possible explanations for these differences .
The C/EBP site is fully dyad symmetric , while the VTG II site contains one ( -1 to +1 ) and the D box contains two ( -1 to +1 and -2 to +2 ) positions of asymmetry .
In addition , our site selection revealed a strong bias against three or more consecutive purine or pyrimidine nucleotides in either half-site , a feature present in both VTG II and albumin D but not C/EBP sites .
To investigate whether either of these possibilities might explain the observed differences in DNA binding , we compared binding by various proteins to sites in which the HLF consensus nucleotides were changed to T at -2 , -1 , or both positions ( Table 1 ) .
Binding to the HLF ( -1T ) site was similar to binding to the consensus site for all proteins , indicating that asymmetry is tolerated at this central position .
Conversely , binding to both the HLF ( -2T ) site which contains three consecutive Ts and the HLF ( -1 , -2T ) site with four consecutive Ts was substantially impaired .
These data suggest that the observed alterations in binding to the VTG II and D box sites are largely due to the presence of three or more consecutive pyrimidines or purines in a half-site and not simply to loss of dyad symmetry .
Impaired binding of E2A-HLF is due to loss of HLF residues amino terminal to the basic region .
The observed differences in DNA binding by E2A-HLF versus HLF occurred despite 5990 HUNGER ET AL .

intact bZIP domains , suggesting that residues outside of the basic region play an important role in determining binding site specificity .
To further investigate this possibility , DNA binding to different sites was compared by using variously truncated HLF proteins ( Fig .
2 ) .
These studies focused on two regions of protein homology that distinguish the PAR subfamily from other bZIP proteins : an amino-terminal extension of the classic basic region ( the BRE ) and the adjacent PAR region ( 10 ) .
These highly conserved domains are not present in E2A-HLF , since each fusion protein contains only HLF residues encoded by exon 4 , including the bZIP and 6 of 21 amino acids which compose the BRE ( 13 ) .
Binding by wild-type HLF was compared with that of different deleted forms of HLF , including HLF®'~ > * , which contains only the residues included in E2A-HLF , HLF `` containing the additional 15 amino acids of the BRE , and HLF `` containing the BRE and PAR domains .
displayed DNA-binding properties analogous to those of the fusion proteins in that it bound well to the HLF consensus , TEF GH , and C/EBP sites but not to the VTG II and albumin D sites ( Fig .
5 and Table 1 ) .
In contrast , HLF®* `` `` `` showed binding to this same panel of sites that was indistinguishable from wild-type HLF .
HLFA `` * `` `` ° showed an intermediate pattern of binding , since it did not fully reconstitute wild-type binding , particularly with the less preferred sites .
These data confirm and extend earlier observations ( 10 ) that residues outside the basic region are important for binding to less preferred sites and further demonstrate that residues within the PAR , in addition to those within the BRE , are necessary for full wild-type DNA binding .
To test this conclusion , we constructed an E2A-HLF protein wherein the entire HLF BRE and PAR domains were reinserted into EH ' `` * `` ° adjacent to the bZIP domains shared by HLF and E2A-HLF .
In contrast to EH `` * `` % , EH `` * `` ® bound well to the VTG II and albumin D sites and its binding site preferences were identical to those of wild-type HLF as measured under our experimental conditions ( Fig .
5 and Table 1 ) .
Thus , the observed differences in DNA binding by E2A-HLF did not result from properties conferred by E2A but were a direct consequence of loss of residues amino terminal to the classic basic region that are specifically conserved in the PAR subfamily of bZIP proteins and function as an ancillary DNA-binding domain .
HLF and E2A-HLF are transcriptional activators with divergent properties dictated by their DNA-binding prefer-ences .
The transcriptional regulatory properties of wild-type HLF and E2A-HLF were investigated by cotransfection of expression vectors into mammalian cells along with reporter constructs containing a CAT gene under control of either the Fusion site ( exon 4 border ) | 74 HLF HLEF253 bZIP PAR gre HLr 41224 h A1-209 l HLF I7 A3-155 p HLF WZ EpytyPe 2 l 1G , EHI526 * EH 526 |___ E2A exons 113 _ ( 77 LOC EH Insertion _ [ i- _ haley |___ E2A exons 1-13 _ ( ¥ FIG .

Wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins bind preferentially to the same consensus site .
The results of binding site selection with three different E2A-HLF chimeras are compared with selection with HLF .

The percent frequency of each nucleotide at positions -7 to +7 is presented in tabular form , and the consensus binding site is listed below .
herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) TK or liver , bone , and kidney alkaline phosphatase promoters linked to concatamerized binding sites .
In CV-1 cells , wild-type HLF strongly activated reporter gene transcription through HLF consensus binding sites and was a less potent activator of reporters containing VTG II sites ( Fig .
6 ) .
HLF®3 `` `` ° did not activate transcription significantly above background levels , indicating that portions required for activation of these reporters were located in the amino-terminal half of wild-type HLF .
Basal activity was minimal on the ( VBP ) , -TK-CAT reporter in the absence of cotransfected activator , whereas more abundant basal activity was consistently observed for the ( HLF ) , -TK-CAT reporter , perhaps reflecting the presence of endogenous HLF , or related proteins , in monkey kidney cells .
E2A-HLF chimeric proteins strongly activated transcription of the ( HLF ) , -TK-CAT reporter in CV-1 cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
Similar levels of activation , ranging from 100 to 150 % of wild-type HLF activity , were observed for all forms of the chimera analyzed ( EH `` * `` ° , EH `` , EHV , and EH `` Y `` * ) .
This activation was dependent on the presence of HLF bZIP domains since E2A-PBX1 , which contains the same portion of E2 , did not increase CAT expression above background levels .
In marked contrast to the results seen with HLF , when the fusion proteins were cotransfected with the ( VBP ) , -TK-CAT reporter , CAT activity was minimally above background levels seen in the absence of cotransfected activator .
Similar results were observed with ( HLF ) , and ( VBP ) , reporters under control of the alkaline phosphatase rather than TK promoter ( data not shown ) .
Thus , both wild-type HLF and wild-type E2A-HLF were capable of potent transcriptional activation of reporters containing high-affinity HLF consensus binding sites .
However , transcriptional activation by E2A-HLF differed from HLF when assayed on more divergent , nonoptimal binding sites such as that found in the VTG II promoter .
The observed differences in transcriptional activation paralleled the DNA-binding differences of the wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins and likely reflected the loss of critical HLF residues following fusion to EZA .
To test this , the transactivation potential of a fusion construct ( EH `` ~ `` ) with restored DNA-binding properties was tested on reporter genes under control of either consensus or nonoptimal binding sites .
EH** `` strongly activated transcription of both the ( HLF ) , - and reporters and in each case was a substantially more potent activator than wild-type HLF ( Fig .
6B ) .
These data indicated that the transcriptional properties of wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins may be markedly divergent and dictated by specific binding sequences because of loss of HLF ancillary DNA-binding regions that occurs following the t ( 17 ; 19 ) translocation .
Both HLF and E2A-HLF are transcriptionally competent in lymphoid cells .
To determine whether the transactivation properties of wild-type HLF might be cell type specific and to investigate the properties of E2A-HLF in human lymphoid cells phenotypically similar to those in which the t ( 17 ; 19 ) translocation is observed , transfections were performed with the ( HLF ) , -TK-CAT reporter in the B-precursor ALL cell line 5992 HUNGER ET AL .

REH ( Fig .
7 ) .
Wild-type HLF activated CAT expression in REH cells approximately fivefold over background levels , analogous to results seen with CV-1 cells .
Significant basal activation of the ( HLF ) , -TK-CAT reporter was observed in the absence of cotransfected activator .
This background activation was dependent on the presence of HLF-binding sites , as it was not seen with reporters lacking binding sites or with reporters containing C/EBP-binding sites .
E2A-HLF proteins were also strong transcriptional activators of the ( HLF ) , -TK-CAT reporter in REH cells .
The isoleucine-containing chimeras were consistently more potent activators than wild-type HLF , while EH `` * `` ° was similar in potency to HLF .
These data demonstrate that wild-type HLF is not restricted in its transactivation capability to cell lineages in which its mRNA is normally expressed ( liver , kidney , and lung ) and that the mechanism for oncogenic activation of HLF by fusion with E2A is not a simple consequence of converting a nonlymphoid activator into one that is transcriptionally competent in lymphoid cells .
HLF wild-type and chimeric proteins transactivate C/EBP reporter constructs .
As wild-type HLF and E2A-HLF bound well to the high-affinity C/EBP site in EMSA , we also investigated whether these proteins could activate a reporter containing concatamerized C/EBP sites ( Fig .
7 ) .
Both wild-type and fusion proteins activated CAT expression from ( C/EBP ) , -TK-CAT .
Consistently less basal activation of the ( C/EBP ) , -TK-CAT reporter in the absence of cotransfected activator was seen compared with results with ( HLF ) , -TK-CAT , thus accounting for a higher fold induction of the ( C/EBP ) , -TK-CAT reporter .

E2A-HLF is capable of dominant-negative inhibition of transcription mediated by wild-type TEF .
The disparate transcriptional properties of HLF and E2A-HLF observed on nonoptimal binding sites suggested that interactions between E2A-HLF and wild-type PAR proteins could potentially occur and significantly alter the normal transcriptional activity of the latter .
Indeed , in previous studies we have shown that E2A-HLF can heterodimerize with each of the wild-type PAR proteins ( 15 ) .
To investigate the transcriptional properties of such heterodimers , we performed cotransfections with TEF expression constructs .
TEF was chosen for these experiments because its mRNA is expressed in human lymphoid cells and Vor .

DISCUSSION The studies described in this report were undertaken to investigate the transcriptional consequences of E2A-HLF fusion which occurs in a subset of ALLs bearing a t ( 17 ; 19 ) ( q21-q22 ; p13 ) translocation .
Structural features predict that EZ2A-HLF should function as a chimeric transcription factor that binds to cognate HLF sites in target gene promoters and activates transcription via specific E2A effector domains .
Our studies demonstrate experimentally that E2A-HLF does indeed possess such transcriptional regulatory properties .
However , while both HLF and EZA-HLF bind avidly to , and activate transcription via , the consensus sequence 5-GTT ACGTAAT-3 ' , significant differences in both DNA-binding and transcriptional activation are seen on certain closely related sites .
In light of the fact that physiologic binding sites for transcription factors are not generally exact matches with in vitro-selected binding sites , these differences may have significant consequences with respect to leukemogenic target genes regulated by the chimera .
In addition , these studies have important implications for understanding the transcriptional properties of HLF and the PAR subfamily of bZIP proteins .
HLF is a transcriptional activator in several cell types .
Our studies demonstrate that HLF functions experimentally as a transcriptional activator of reporter constructs containing appropriate binding sites upstream of minimal promoters .
HLF was transcriptionally competent in both CV-1 monkey kidney cells which express wild-type HLF mRNA and in human B-precursor ALL cells in which HLF mRNA is normally absent .
In addition , we have observed that HLF can activate transcription in NIH 3T3 cells which also do not express HLF mRNA ( 12 ) .
This property clearly distinguishes HLF from the closely related PAR protein DBP which is transcriptionally competent only in hepatocytes or hepatocyte-derived cell lines ( 21 , 27 , 36 ) .
In this respect HLF is more functionally analogous to TEF/VBP ; in fact , in these and other studies ( 12 ) we have observed no differences between HLF and TEF with respect to either binding site preferences or transcriptional regulatory properties .
It is apparent from the DNA-binding studies presented herein and earlier by others that PAR proteins are capable of substantial cross-recognition of various binding sites ( 11 , 15 , 17 ) .
The ability of PAR proteins to heterodimerize with one another introduces an additional layer of complexity .
The situation is further complicated by the binding of PAR proteins to sites recognized by C/EBP proteins and vice versa , although heterodimerization between proteins in the different classes has not been observed and structural constraints predict that it should not occur ( 33 ) .
However , it is possible that PAR and C/EBP proteins can interact by other mechanisms , as DBP has been suggested to synergize with C/EBP in postpubertal activation of the factor IX promoter that occurs in hemophilia B Leyden ( 29 ) .
The mechanism of this synergy is undefined but does not involve direct DNA binding by heterodimers .
Thus , PAR proteins by themselves and in combination with C/EBP proteins potentially comprise a complex regulatory network , particularly in the liver , where many of these proteins appear to be expressed simultaneously .
It will be technically challenging to experimentally sort out the relative contributions of individual proteins to the expression of specific genes ; however , such combinatorial regulatory networks are also a common feature of other transcription factor families .

E2A-HLF and HLF .
Similar to HLF , E2A-HLF chimeric proteins isolated from different t ( 17 ; 19 ) -bearing leukemias strongly activated transcription of reporter genes through both the HLF consensus binding site and a C/EBP high-affinity site .
In our studies , type I and type II E2A-HLF fusion proteins displayed identical transcriptional potencies , despite the fact that type II chimeras lack residues encoded by £24 exon 13 that have been suggested to play an important role by some investigators ( 2 ) , although not by others ( 30 ) , in one of the two identified E2A activation domains .
Our results indicate that the exon 13-encoded portion of E2A proteins does not contribute significantly to transcriptional activation by E2A-HLF in lymphoid or kidney cells .
However , the transcriptional properties of HLF and E2A-HLF differed in two potentially important respects .
E2A-HLF was clearly a more robust activator in lymphoid cells phenotypically similar to those in which the t ( 17 ; 19 ) translocation is observed , whereas their potencies were more similar in CV-1 cells .
In addition , transcriptional properties of E2A-HLF diverged from those of HLF consequent to alterations in DNA binding which , simplistically , can be summarized as a reduced tolerance of E2A-HLF for certain deviations from the consensus that create a less preferred binding site .
Each of the E2A-HLF chimeras with wild-type zipper domains displayed analogous site preferences and transcriptional regulatory properties despite differences in primary amino acid sequence at the site of protein fusion .
Furthermore , mutation of the leucine zipper , as occurs in at least one reported E2A-HLF chimera ( 15 ) , had no significant effect on binding or transcriptional regulatory properties when assessed with the HLF consensus site but exacerbated the divergences observed on less preferred sites .
It is currently unclear whether this mutation may direct the E2A-HLF chimera away from or toward select binding sites in vivo or simply was tolerated as functionally insignificant in the leukemia cells in which it arose .
Distinguishing between these two possibilities will require an in vitro transformation assay .
The most dramatic differences between the transcriptional effects of wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins were observed with reporters containing nonoptimal binding sites such as VBP VTG II sites .
Despite decreased binding to this site in EMSA , wild-type HLF and TEF each activated transcription from reporters containing concatamers of this site ; in contrast , E2A-HLF displayed no significant ability to bind to this site in EMSA or to activate transcription of VTG II site-containing reporters .
In fact , using exogenously transfected activator constructs , we found that E2A-HLF was capable of abolishing TEF-mediated transcriptional activation of VTG II site-containing reporters in a dominant-negative manner .
We attempted to test the physiologic significance of the observed repression by transfecting VTG II site-containing reporters into cell lines with and without the t ( 17 ; 19 ) translocation and relying on endogenous , rather than exogenous , levels of EZA-HLF for repression .
However , basal levels of expression from both VBP-TK-CAT and VBP-AP-CAT reporters were virtually undetectable ( 1 to 2 % CAT conversion ) and no different from reporters lacking binding sites .
This lack of VTG II site-dependent baseline transcriptional activation made it technically impossible to address this question by relying on endogenous levels of protein expression .
It should be emphasized that the repression observed in cotransfection experiments occurred with fairly modest ratios of E2A-HLF to TEF ( 5:1 ) , suggesting that gross overexpression of E2A-HLF is not required .
It is likely that the observed inhibition occurred through sequestration of TEF in EZA-HLF-TEF heterodimeric complexes that are significantly impaired in binding Vor .
14 , 1994 to the nonoptimal VTG II site .
In support of this , we found that while E2A-HLF-TEF heterodimers bound well to the TEF GH and HLF consensus sites , binding to the VTG II site was barely detectable in EMSA ( 12 , 15 ) .
Although TEF mRNA is present in human lymphoid cells , including t ( 17 ; 19 ) -ALL cell lines ( 12 ) , it is currently uncertain whether or not TEF or other endogenous proteins are available for in vivo dimerization with E2A-HLF .
However , our findings suggest the potential for heteromeric interactions that may alter expression of a subset of subordinate genes with nonoptimal binding sites .
Transcriptional differences result from loss of an HLF ancillary DNA-binding domain .
PAR proteins each possess an amino-terminal extension of the basic region that contains a highly conserved cluster of basic amino acids and the adjacent PAR domain .
Drolet et al .
( 11 ) have previously demonstrated that experimental substitution of alanines for pairs of lysine residues within this cluster substantially altered TEF binding to a recognition element in the prolactin gene promoter , but not the GH site .
Our studies confirm and extend these observations to underscore the importance of regions outside the classic basic region for binding to select , nonoptimal sites .
These differences were a consistent feature of EZA-HLF fusion proteins and experimentally truncated HLF constructs .
Furthermore , our data show that residues within the PAR also contribute to DNA binding , since restoration of wild-type binding required both the PAR and BRE within the backbone of the E2A-HLF fusion protein .
By analogy , Jun contains a functionally similar ancillary DNA-binding domain which is also located immediately amino terminal to the basic region ( 1 ) .
Similar to the PAR , this region is proline rich , but there is no obvious structural homology between Jun and HLF in this region .
Broad spectrum of potential E2A-HLF target genes .
In this report we have ( at least partially ) defined the spectrum of sites to which HLF binds , the subset of those sites bound by E2A-HLF , and the transcriptional effects of wild-type and chimeric HLF proteins on reporter genes containing concatamers of optimal or nonoptimal binding sites .
Each of the sites employed in experiments described herein contained complementary pairs of thymidine and adenosine nucleotides at positions -4 and -3 and +3 and +4 .
This feature is characteristic of high-affinity binding sites for the PAR and C/EBP subclasses of bZIP proteins .
In contrast , high-affinity binding sites for members of the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB bZIP subfamilies do not contain such pairs ( 18 ) .
We have also observed that both HLF and EZ2ZA-HLF are capable of binding to sites composed of one PAR- or C/EBP -like half-site and one Fos/Jun- or ATF/CREB-like half-site ( 12 ) .
Thus , potential leukemogenic target genes regulated by the chimera include not only cognate targets of HLF and related PAR proteins but also those normally regulated by other bZIP proteins .
One such protein to consider is E4BP4 , which is highly homologous to HLF within the basic region and binds preferentially to a site , ( G/A ) T ( G/T ) A ( C/T ) GTAA ( C/T ) , that is essentially identical to the HLF consensus site ( 8 ) .
Interestingly , EABP4 functions experimentally as a transcriptional repressor .
Two additional bZIP chimeras are known to be created by chromosomal translocations in human malignancies-TLS- ( FUS ) /CHOP-10 ( 9 , 31 ) and EWS/ATF-1 ( 38 ) .
Similar to E2A-HLF , each of these chimeras consists of a bZIP region fused to a portion of the structurally related proteins EWS or TLS ( FUS ) that contain potential transactivation domains .
Given this structural similarity , it will be important to determine whether or not the transforming properties of these TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATORY PROPERTIES OF E2A-HLF 5995 different bZIP chimeras are mediated by aberrant transcriptional regulation of an overlapping set of target genes .
Functional consequences of E2A-HLF fusion .
We have demonstrated previously that endogenous E2A-HLF-contain-ing complexes are present in the HAL-O1 t ( 17 ; 19 ) -ALL cell line ( 15 ) .
Similar complexes are observed when EMSA is performed with HAL-O1 nuclear extracts and the HLF consensus site , and these complexes comigrate with IVT E2A-HLF homodimers ( 12 ) .
Thus , our studies are consistent with a model in which the leukemogenic effects of E2A-HLF are mediated by its ability to activate transcription of target genes as a homodimer .
In addition , possible heteromeric interactions with potential dominant-negative effects on transcription of select subordinate genes can not be excluded , but their in vivo significance remains to be determined .
E2A-HLF chimeras resulting from t ( 17 ; 19 ) translocation are structurally analogous to E2A-PBX1 proteins in t ( 1 ; 19 ) -bear-ing leukemias ( 19 , 28 ) .
In both cases , the amino-terminal portion of EZ2A including its transactivation domains is fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain donated by genes not normally expressed in lymphoid cells .
PBX1 and closely related PBX2 and PBX3 proteins ( 26 ) bind a specific DNA sequence but do not activate reporter genes containing this site , in contrast to E2A-PBX1 , which is a robust activator on the same reporters ( 22 , 32 ) .
Similarly , wild-type PBX proteins are incapable of transforming NIH 3T3 cells and require fusion with E2A to activate their oncogenic potential ( 25 ) .
Thus , t ( 1 ; 19 ) -induced chimeras appear to have unique transcriptional regulatory and transforming properties not possessed by either of the constituent wild-type proteins .
By comparison , the transcriptional differences between HLF and E2A-HLF appear more subtle , as both functioned as activators in our experimental assays .
This raises the issue of whether protein fusion is essential for activation of the oncogenic potential of HLF or whether wild-type HLF may also function as an oncoprotein in the correct cellular context .
It is not clear from our studies whether there is a specific role for the EZ2A transactivation domains as opposed to others in conferring oncogenic potential to the HLF bZIP domains .
Establishment of an in vitro transformation assay for E2A-HLF will allow an experimental assessment of these issues .
However , our studies have established the spectrum of possible transcriptional regulatory properties of t ( 17 ; 19 ) -encoded chimeras and will serve as a foundation for future studies aimed at determining which of these properties is essential for transformation and to help identify leukemogenic target genes .
