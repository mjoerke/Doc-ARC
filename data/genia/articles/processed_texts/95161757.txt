Detection of the Chromosome 16 CBFB-MYH11 Fusion Transcript in Myelomonocytic Leukemias By Héléne Poirel , Isabelle Radford-Weiss , Katrina Rack , Xavier Troussard , Agnés Veil , Frangoise Valensi , Frangoise Picard , Martine Guesnu , Daniel Leboeuf , Josianne Melle , Frangois Dreyfus , Georges Flandrin , and Elizabeth Macintyre Karyotypic detection of chromosomal 16 abnormalities classically associated with AML M4Eo can be difficult .
Characterization of the two genes involved in the inv { 16 ) ( p13q22 ) , CBFB and MYH11 , has allowed the detection of fusion transcripts by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction { ( RT-PCR ) .
We have analyzed CBFB-MYH11 fusion transcripts by RT-PCR in myelomonocytic leukemias , with or without eosinophilia , to determine whether their presence correlates with morphology .
Fifty-three cases ( 11 AML M4EOo ; 1 AML M4 with atypical abnormal eosinophils ( AML M4 `` Eo ' `` ) ; 29 AML M4 ; 8 AML M5 ; 3 CMML ; and 1 AML M2 with eosino-philia ) were analyzed .
All 11 typical AML M4EOo were MYH11 positive .
The single case of AML M4 with distinctive eosinophil abnormalities was negative by karyotype , RT-PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) .
Three of 29 ( 10 % ) AML M4 without abnormal eosinophils were CBFG-MYH11 positive , 1 of which did not show any apparent chro- DISTINCT SUBSET of patients with acute myelomonocytic leukemia associated with abnormal bone marrow eosinophilic precursors has been identified as AML M4 with eosinophilia ( AML M4EOo ) . '
'' This category includes > ~6 % of patients with AML and around 20 % of AML M4 . ``
It is defined by the presence of morphologic , cytochem-ical , and ultrastructural abnormalities in the eosinophil lin-eage , which usually amounts to 5 % or more of nonerythroid cells . ``
Identification of AML M4Eo is important because it is associated with a relatively favorable prognosis , `` `` both with regard to the complete remission rate and the duration of remission and survival when compared with other AMLM4 treated similarly .
The majority of AML M4Eo show structural abnormalities of chromosome 16 , most frequently involving 16p13 and 16422 , leading either to a pericentric inversion , inv ( 16 ) ( p13 ; q22 ) ° ( Fig 1A ) or , less commonly ( up to 30 % of cases ) , to a translocation between the two homologous chromosomes , t ( 16 ; ,16 ) ( p13 ; q22 ) . '
Cytogenetic detection of inversions and small deletions of chromosome 16 by standard karyotype analysis can be difficult , especially following R-banding techniques .
Although the majority of inv { ( 16 ) ( p13 ; q22 ) have been identified in AML M4Eo , this abnormality has occasionally been described in other myeloid malignancies , including AML M2 , M4 without eosinophilia , M5 , the myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) , and blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia . ``
The majority of MDS cases have been associated with eosinophilia , abnormal eosinophils or with transformation to AML M4Eo . ``
Chromosomal abnormalities involving 16q22 and several other chromosomes , including 3q24 , 5q33 , 14g32 , 4435 , and 1p31 , have been identified in patients with myeloid malignancies ( AML M4 , MDS ) These have often been associated with abnormal eosinophils , suggesting that the genes situated at 16q22 may be involved in the abnormal eosinophil maturation .
Recent cloning of the 16p and 16q breakpoints identified Blood , Vol 85 , No 5 ( March 1 } , 1995 : pp 1313-1322 mosome 16 abnormalities by classical metaphase analysis ( 2 not tested ) .
Both cases tested also showed MYH11 genomic rearrangement .
None of the other leukemias were RT-PCR positive .
Follow-up of three patients showed residual positivity in apparent complete remission .
These data show that fusion transcripts occur not only in the vast majority of typical AML M4Eo , but also in ~10 % of AML M4 without eosinophilic abnormalities , a much higher incidence than the sporadic reports of chromosome 16 abnormalities in AML M4 would suggest .
Taken together with the detection of CBFB-MYH11 transcripts in the absence of apparent chromosome 16 abnormalities by classical banding tech-niques , these data show that additional screening by either RT-PCR or FISH should be performed in all AML M4 , regardless of morphologic features , to allow accurate evaluation of the prognostic importance of this fusion transcript .

MYH11 , situated at 16p13 , codes for a smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain gene .
The CBF } gene , also known as PEBP2/3 , is situated at 16q22 and codes for the 3 subunit of core binding factor ( CBF ) , a heterodimeric transcription factor known to bind to the enhancers of various murine leukemia viruses `` and to similar motifs in the enhancers of the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) genes .
'* `` `` The CBFa ( or PEBP2 @ ) subunit is identical to AML1 , one of the genes involved in the t ( 8 ; 21 ) translocation associated with AML M2 . ``
In vitro analysis indicates that murine CBF does not bind directly to DNA , but forms a heterodimeric complex with CBFa , thus stabilizing its interaction with DNA . ``
Molecular analysis of inv ( 16 ) samples showed the presence of an in-frame fusion messenger RNA from the abnormal 16p connecting the first 165 amino acids of CBF to the tail region of the coding region of MYH11 .
The clustering of breakpoints within the fusion transcript allowed its detection From the Departments of Hematology , Cytogenetics , and CNRA URA 1461 , CHU Necker-Enfants Malades and University Paris V , Paris ; the Department of Hematology , Hopital Clémenceau , Caen ; the Department of Hematology , Hopital Cochin , Paris , France .

by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) `` ( Fig 1B ) .
In all cases analyzed to date , the breakpoint in the fusion mRNA occurred at the same point ( nucleotide [ nt ] 495 ) in the CBF/3 sequence , leading to removal of the last 17 amino acids of the potential CBF/3 protein .
Four breakpoints within the MYH11 fusion mRNA have been described in a study of 36 cases of AML M4Eo with chromosome 16 abnormalities , ' `` with the predominant form ( A , nt 1921 ) occurring in ~80 % ( 29/36 ) of cases and the variant forms being found much less frequently ( B , nt 1528 , 1/36 ; C , nt 1201 , 4/36 ; D , nt 994 , 2/36 ) ( Fig 1B ) .
All of these rearrangements maintain the reading frame .
It is likely that the 5° CBFG-MYH11 3 ' fusion transcript , rather than the potential 5° MYH11-CBF/3 3 ' reciprocal transcript , is more important for leukemogenesis because AML M4Eo patients with inv ( 16 ) and an associated deletion centromeric to the p arm breakpoint have been described . ``
Furthermore , Liu et al `` failed to detect any reciprocal fusion transcripts in 3 cases of inv ( 16 ) .
In view of the recognized difficulty in karyotypic detection of inv ( 16 ) , even when specifically looked for , we postulated that the incidence of fusion transcripts in AML M4 without eosinophilia may be higher than the occasional reports of karyotypic chromosome 16 abnormalities would suggest .
We show that CBFS-MYH11 fusion transcripts occur not only in cases with typical M4E0o , but also in 10 % of AML M4 without abnormal eosinophils , suggesting that RT-PCR screening of AML M4 leukemias will improve prognostic evaluation of these cases .
We also show that CBF3-MYH11 fusion transcripts can occur in cases with POIREL ET AL complex chromosome 16 abnormalities and in the absence of any apparent abnormality by standard metaphase analysis .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients .
Fifty-three patients ( 50 AML , 3 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [ CMML ] ) diagnosed and treated in three different centers between 1986 and 1994 were studied .
Median age was 46 years ( range , 2 months to 78 years ) , with 23 males and 30 females .
RNA from a case of inv ( 16 ) positive AML M4Eo showing a type C ( nt 1201 ) breakpoint was generously provided by J. Hebert & F. Sigaux ( Hopital Saint-Louis , Paris , France ) .
Morphology .
- Morphologic diagnosis and classification was performed on bone marrow and peripheral blood smears stained by May-Griinwald-Giemsa , according to the French-American-British ( FAB ) cooperative criteria . ``
All diagnostic marrow specimens were reviewed for leukemic cell and eosinophil morphology by G. Flandrin , member of the FAB cooperative group .
Where M4 criteria were met , the diagnosis of M4Eo was restricted to cases with characteristic eosinophilic abnormalities in bone marrow cells .
Cytochemical analysis with chloro-acetate esterase was performed by standard techniques in selected AML M4 cases . ``
Cytogenetic analysis .
- Chromosome analysis were performed on bone marrow cells and/or unstimulated blood cells ( 24 and/or 48 hours in vitro culture ) with GTG ( G-bands obtained by trypsin and stained with Giemsa ) and/or RHG ( R-bands by heating using Giemsa ) techniques .
The nomenclature used to describe chromosomal karyotypic abnormalities follows the recommendations of the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature . ``
RT-PCR analysis .
Total RNA was extracted from leukemic cells , after thawing and washing , by the single-step method of Chomezynski and Sacchi . ``
cDNA was synthesized from 1 to 2 ug of total RNA with 200 U Moloney-murine leukemia virus ( M-MLV ) reverse transcriptase ( GIBCO-BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) in PCR buffer ( 10 mmol/L TRIS HCI ( pH 8.3 ) , 50 mmol/L KCI , 3 mmol/L MgCl ; ) containing random hexamer primers ( 10 mmol/L ) , deoxynucleotide triphosphates ( dNTP ; 1 mmol/L each ) , 20 U RNAsin , 10 % dithio-threitol ( DTT ) in diethyl pyrocarbonate treated water ( final reaction volume 20 4L ) at 37°C for 1 hour .
The mixture was heated to 70°C for 10 minutes then cooled on ice .
Four microliters of cDNA ( 0.2 to 0.4 ug RNA ) , PCR buffer as above , 50 mmol/L TRIS HCI ( pH 8.3 ) , 75 mmol/L KCI , 2.5 mmol/L MgCl , , 0.2 mmol/L dNTP , 6 % formamide , 0.4 umol/L oligonucleotide primers , and 2.5 U Taq polymerase ( Perkin-Elmer Cetus , Norwalk , CT ) in a total volume of 50 ul were amplified for 35 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler ( Biometra , Géttingen , Germany ) with a stepwise program consisting of 92°C for 30 seconds , 57°C ( M1 and M3 ) or 60°C ( M2 ) for 1 minute , and 72°C for 1 minute .
This was preceeded by a denaturation step of 92°C for 3 minutes before the first cycle .
The final extension phase was increased to 10 minutes .
RT-PCR screening for MYH11 fusion transcripts was performed using a sense CBFS primer , C1 , 5-GCAGGCAAGGTATATTTGAAGG-3 ' ( nt 253-274 ) and either the antisense primer , M1 , 5-CTCTTCTCCTCATTC-TGCTC-3 ' ( reverse sequence of nt 2095-2114 of MYH11 ) '* `` ( Fig 1B ) or , in an independant PCR reaction , the M3 antisense primer , 5-TGAAGCAACTCCTGGGTGTC-3 ' ( reverse sequence of nt 1298 through 1317 of MYH11 ) .
In addition , certain cases were also amplified with C1 and an additional MYH11 antisense primer , M2 , 5'-ACTGCAGCTCCTGCACCTGC-3 ' ( reverse sequence of nt 1119 through 1138 of MYH11 ) ( Fig 1B ) .
The PCR product was size-fractionated by electrophoresis in a 2 % agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide .
Quality of RNA was assessed by concurrent amplification of 3-actin transcripts from the same cDNA using oligonucleotide primers and conditions as described in `` `` and , in unique patient number ( UPN ) 11 , by amplification of Abelson transcripts From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

CHROMOSOME 16 CBFS-MYH11 using exon 2 and exon 3 primers as previously described . ``
Peripheral blood leukocyte ( PBL ) RNA and no-RNA-negative controls were reverse transcribed and amplified in parallel with all patient samples .
Standard precautions were undertaken to prevent product carry-over .
For the detection of residual tumor cells , a seminested internal amplification was performed from 4 gL of a 1:100 dilution of amplified product for 35 cycles under identical conditions , but with an internal CBF primer C2 ( 5-GGGCTGTCTGGAGTT-TGATG-3 ' ) .
To confirm the identity of the amplified products and to aid detection of any larger fragments generated with the C1-M1 pair of oligo-nucleotides , PCR products were transferred to nylon membranes by Southern blotting and hybridized with the internal CBF oligonucleotide probe C2 labeled with gamma *P adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) using T4 polynucleotide kinase .
Southern-blot analysis and DNA probes .
To confirm the RT-PCR findings in selected cases , high molecular-weight DNA was extracted from cryopreserved cells and digested with EcoRI , subjected to electrophoresis on 0.7 % agarose , transferred to nylon membranes ( Hybond N+ , Amersham ) , and hybridized with a random primed radiolabeled MYH11 probe .
The cDNA MYH11 probe , LISP2 , was a 2-kb EcoRI insert in Bluescript kindly provided by Hans Dauwerse . ``
'' Membranes were washed at a final stringency of 0.2 x saline sodium citrate ( SSC ) and 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65°C before autoradiography .
Fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis .
- Cosmids 36 and 40 , which were generously provided by Hans Dauwerse `` `` and are located centromeric and telomeric , respectively , to the inversion 16 short arm breakpoint , were used for FISH studies .
Probes were labeled with biotin-14-dATP ( Bionick kit , GIBCO-BRL ) .
In situ hybridization was performed as follows : 50 ng of each cosmid was combined with 5 ug of human Cot-1 competitor DNA in 10 gL of 50 % formamide , 2 x SSC , 10 % dextran sulphate , pH 7.0 .
The probe mix was denatured at 75°C for 5 minutes and the repetitive sequences were allowed to preanneal at 37°C for 15 minutes .
The slides were denatured at 70°C in 70 % formamide , 2 X SSC PH 7.0 for 4 minutes and then dehydrated through a cold ethanol series of washes .
The probes were hybridized overnight under a sealed coverslip at 37°C .
The slides were then washed 3 times at 37°C for 5 minutes each time in 50 % formamide , 2 x SSC , pH 7.0 followed by three 5-minutes washes in 2 X SSC , pH 7.0 .
The biotin-labeled sequences were detected with goat antibiotin ( 1/50 dilution , Sigma Chemical Co , St Louis , MO ) followed by rabbit-antigoat conjuguated to FITC ( 1/80 dilution , Sigma ) .
The chromosomes were counter-stained with propidium iodide and the slides were analyzed using a Leitz Axio-phot microscope and photographed using Ektachrome ASA 400 film .
RESULTS Patient characteristics .
| The 53 cases studied were classified without prior knowledge of RT-PCR findings as follows ( Table 1 ) : 11 AML M4Eo with typical bone marrow eosinophilic abnormalities ( median 10 % eosinophil precur-sors , range , 3 % to 50 % ) including classical morphologic eosinophil abnormalities such as the presence of cells containing large , irregular , immature , dark purple rather than bluish granules , admixed with normal appearing granules ( Fig 2a ) ; 1 AML M4 with bone marrow eosinophilia ( 14 % ) , named AML M4*Eo `` , but with distinct bone marrow abnormalities of eosinophilic precursors such as small cells arrested at the promyelocyte or myelocyte stage with eccentric nuclei , normal cytoplasmic eosinophilic granules clustered around a large Golgi zone , and a basophilic vacuolated cytoplasm ( Fig 2B ) ; 29 AML M4 without any bone marrow 1315 eosinophilic abnormalities ( and with =5 % eosinophils ) ; 8 AML MS and 3 CMML without any bone marrow eosinophilic abnormalities ; 1 AML M2 with normal eosinophilia ( ~14 % in the bone marrow ) .
Karyotypic abnormalities .
- Karyotype analysis was performed in 42 cases , with sufficient metaphases ( at least 10 ) being available for analysis in 41 cases .
Chromosome 16 abnormalities ( including inv ( 16 ) and one complex abnormality involving one chromosome 16 ) were observed in 8 cases , all of which were classified as M4Eo .
In 2 cases ( UPN 5 and 6 ) , the abnormal chromosome 16 was associated with trisomy 22 .
Other karyotypic abnormalities and the number of metaphases analyzed are listed in Table 1 .
In the one case of AML showing a t ( 8 ; 21 ) ( q22 ; q22 ) , UPN 22 , the classification as AML M4 at both initial presentation and relapse was confirmed at panel review .
Ninety percent of t ( 8 ; 21 ) occur in AML M2 , but the remainder classify as M4 . ``
RT-PCR analysis of this case showed a classical AMLI-ETO fusion transcript ( data not shown ) .
Detection of CBFB-MYH11 fusion transcripts by RT-PCR .
Fourteen of 53 cases showed a CBF # -MYH11 fusion transcript .
Two independent amplification reactions using different MYH11 antisense primers ( M1 and M3 ) were performed in all cases , in addition to parallel amplification of B-actin transcripts to assess RNA quality .
Primer M1 allows detection of fusion transcripts containing MYH11 nt 1921 ( A ) and nt 1528 ( B ) breakpoints , whereas primer M3 will detect both nt 1201 ( C ) and nt 994 ( D ) breakpoints .
Additional amplification of 16 cases ( UPN 1 , 2 , 8 through 12 , 15 , 16 , 40 , and 43 through 48 ) with the M2 antisense primer allowing detection of type D transcripts ( data not shown ) did not show any positive cases .
Because these transcripts could also be detected with the M3 oligonucleotide , screening of cases was undertaken with the latter primer .
All fusion transcripts detected corresponded to the predominant nt 1921 ( A ) breakpoint within MYH11 .
B-actin transcripts were observed in all CBFG3-MYH11-negative cases ( Fig 3A ) .
Amplification of a positive control RNA from a case of inv ( 16 ) -AML with a type C breakpoint showed the expected 337-bp band with primer M3 ( Fig 3B ) , showing that this oligonucleotide was capable of detecting a fusion transcript under the condition used .
Typical AML M4Eo .
All 11 AML M4Eo ( Table 1 ) showed a CBFS-MYH11 fusion transcript by RT-PCR ; in 9 of 10 , the chromosome 16 was abnormal by karyotype analysis .
The fusion transcript observed in case UPN 10 , not characterized by classical morphologic abnormalities ( Fig 2A ) but by an unusual chromosome 16 abnormality , was identical with regard to both size and ability to hybridize to an internal probe to the classical inv ( 16 ) cases ( Fig 3A ) .
One case ( UPN 3 ) of typical AML M4Eo showed a MYH11 fusion transcript despite the fact that the four analyzable metaphases were normal .
Although the number of available mitosis does limit the validity of the negative karyotypic result , it does support the recognized difficulty in detecting inv ( 16 ) .
These results show that all cases with a karyotypically identified chromosome 16 rearrangement and/or typical eosinophilic abnormalities have an abnormal CBFS-MYH11 fusion transcript , as recently shown . ``

AML M4 with distinct morphologic eosinophil abnormalities .
- The single case of AML M4 showing unique and very unusual eosinophilic abnormalities ( UPN 11 ) was negative by both standard karyotype analysis and RT-PCR , including after hybridization of both C1-M1 and C1-M3 PCR products with an internal C2 radiolabeled probe ( Fig 2B and data not shown ) .
At original morphologic classification by one FAB cooperative group member ( G. Flandrin ) , before knowledge of the karyotypic or molecular findings , the distinctive features precluded inclusion as AML M4Eo .
The cytochemical findings were also unusual in so far as the chloro-acetate esterase reaction was negative in the eosinophils of this pa From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

tient , unlike classical cases of AML M4Eo ( data not shown ) . ``
Recent reports have shown that DNA contamination of RNA samples extracted by the phenol chloroform technique , as performed here , can lead to amplification of apparent -actin transcripts from pseudogenes , thus providing an inaccurate assessment of the quality of the RNA . ``
To exclude this possible explanation for the absence of CBFS-MYH11 transcripts in this case , we confirmed the presence of amplifiable RNA by showing appropriately sized bands after RT-PCR amplification of Abelson transcripts , as previously described * ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , it was unlikely that the negative result was caused by RNA degradation .

Reevaluation of the karyotypic findings in this case ( UPN 12 ) failed to show any chromosome 16 abnormalities in the 35 mitoses analyzed , although both R- and G-banding techniques were performed .
Unfortu-nately , insufficient material was available from either of the CBFB-MYH11-positive/karyotype-negative cases ( UPN 3 and 12 ) for FISH analysis .
It is noteworthy that UPN 12 exhibited an isolated trisomy 22 , known to be frequently associated with inv ( 16 ) , `` `` as it was in patients UPN 5 and 6 .
Amplification of RNA from a second vial of frozen blasts from this patient and from an apparent remission bone marrow sample ( see below ) confirmed the positivity in this case .
Prolonged morphologic reevaluation of the bone marrow smears from the three RT-PCR-positive cases showed rare abnormal eosinophilic precursors in UPN 12 and 13 ( around 1/500 and 1/200 , respectively ) , whereas no abnormal eosinophils were seen in the third case , UPN 14 .
None of the eight AML M5 , three CMML , or the AML M2 with eosinophilia showed RT-PCR ( 0/13 ) or karyotypic ( 0/9 ) abnormalities .
Detection of chromosome 16 abnormalities by FISH .
- To confirm the absence of an inverted chromosome 16 in the AML M4* `` Eo `` , UPN 11 , we performed FISH analysis with cosmids c40 and c36 ; although in the positive control , patient UPN 52 , an inversion 16 was observed in 28/30 metaphases ( Fig 2C ) , no inverted chromosomes 16 were detected in the 65 metaphases analyzed ( data not shown ) .
MYH11 rearrangement by Southern blotting .
- To confirm the finding of fusion transcripts in the absence of eosinophilia and/or karyotypic chromosome 16 dis-ruption , we analyzed DNA from UPN 3 , 12 , and 14 and from a classical AML M4Eo with inv ( 16 ) ( UPN 52 ) .
High molecular-weight rearranged fragments ( > 25 kb ) were observed in EcoRI digests from the inv ( 16 ) -positive control ( UPN 52 ) , and the three other cases ( Fig 4 and data not shown ) .
The bands observed were similar to those previously described by van der Reijden in inv ( 16 ) cases . ``
'' These finding confirm that the MYH11 gene is indeed rearranged .
Detection of residual disease by RT-PCR .
To evaluate the sensitivity of detection of CBF3 -MYH11 transcripts , we diluted cDNA from patient UPN 14 into cDNA from PBLs and performed single-stage or seminested amplification using an internal CBF/ primer , C2 .
We were able to detect the expected band at a 10~ dilution with the external primers MI-C1 and at 10~* after internal reamplification with M1I-C2 ( Fig 5 ) .
Parallel RT-PCR detection of CBFP-MYH11 in RNA extracted from bone marrow samples taken during morphologic complete remission was performed in three CBF3-MYH11-positive patients ( UPN 8 , 10 , 12 ) 1 , 3 , and 6 months after diagnosis , respectively .
All three patients showed residual disease after single-stage amplification ( 35 cycles ) and either hybridization with an internal CBF oligonucleotide probe or reamplification with C2 in a seminested procedure ( Fig 5 ) , generating fragments of the expected size .
Amplified bands were also visible by ethidium bromide staining from patients UPN 8 and 10 after a single amplifica- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

These results show that the increased sensitivity of detection of RT-PCR detection when compared with classical cytogenetics will allow improved follow-up of patients with AML M4 .
DISCUSSION In this paper , we show that CBFB-MYH11 fusion transcripts can be detected , not only in virtually all cases of typical AML M4 Eo , but also in =~10 % ( 3/29 ) of AML M4 without eosinophilic abnormalities .
This incidence is much higher than the sporadic reports of karyotypic chromosome 16 abnormalities in AML M4 would suggest .
Furthermore , we show CBF3-MYH11 fusion transcripts and MYH11 rearrangement in at least one case reported to be karyotypically normal .
Molecular screening by RT-PCR of 53 myeloid malignancies showing monocytic differentiation ( AML M4 , AML MS , and CMML ) showed that all CBF3-MYH11-positive cases were AML M4 , suggesting that routine screening is not justified in AML MS , although formal demonstration of this requires analysis of a larger numbers of patients .
Of the 41 AML M4 cases analyzed , 27 % ( 11/41 ) were typical AML M4Eo , similar to previous reports . ``
34 % ( 14/41 ) of AMLM4 overall were CBF3-MYH1 1 positive , suggesting that routine molecular screening of AML M4 will pick up a significant number of CBF3-MYH11-positive cases .
Because 21 % ( 3/ 14 ) of these cases did not show abnormal eosinophils , such procedures should not be limited to AML M4Eo .
All CBF3-MYH11 fusion transcripts detected in this study involved the predominant MYH11 breakpoint ( type A ) , previously described to occur in 80 % of 36 cases with inv ( 16 ) or t ( 16 ; 16 ) . '
'' The remaining 20 % of cases shown by Claxton et al involved three variant MYH11 breakpoints ( Fig 1B ) detectable in the present series as larger amplified fragments with the M1 oligonucleotide ( type B ) or with a second upstream oligonucleotide , M3 ( types C and D ) .
The absence of variant breakpoints is probably caused by the limited number of M4Eo cases analyzed .
False-negative results are unlikely because ( 1 ) all patients with typical M4Eo were RT-PCR positive ; ( 2 ) amplification with C1 and M3 primers UPN 14 -2 0-8 ~4 0-5 « - 322 pb Fig 5 .

1320 of a cDNA transcribed from a patient with a type C breakpoint generated the expected transcript ; ( 3 ) amplification of RT-PCR-negative cases with the Ml and primers under conditions favoring the formation of longer PCR fragments ( prolongation of the elongation step to 3 minutes ) failed to show any larger bands of the expected size , including after hybridization with an internal CBFS probe .
All 11 typical AML MA4Eo were CBFG-MYH11 positive , including one case reported to be karyotypically normal on a limited numder of metaphases , thus confirming the results of Claxton et al . ``
'' We also show that complex chromosome 16 abnormalities , as found in UPN10 , can recreate the same fusion transcript as classical inv ( 16 ) or t ( 16 ; 16 ) .
The single case showing distinctive eosinophil abnormalities ( UPN 11 ) was CBFG-MYH11 negative and did not show any evident chromosome 16 abnormalities , even by FISH analysis with chromosome 16p probes .
The distinct nature of these morphologic abnormalities had been documented before obtaining either the karyotype or PCR results and the case had been classified as AML M4 with atypical abnormal eosinophils rather than as M4Eo .
This case suggests that AML M4 with eosinophilia but without the typical morphologic features of AML MA4Eo may represent a distinct subtype of AML M4 involving either distinct breakpoints in MYH11 and/or CBFL or distinct genetic abnormalities .
The absence of karyotypic and FISH abnormalities are in favor of the latter .
In practical terms , it shows that it is the presence of certain qualitative abnormalities of eosinophil maturation which correlates most closely with chromosome 16 defects .
Three of the 29 AML M4 cases without eosinophilic abnormalities ( UPN 12 , 13 , 14 ) showed a CBFS-MYH11 fusion transcript .
The fusion transcript was confirmed by Southern blotting of a MYH11 rearrangement in two cases ( UPN 12 and 14 ) .
Although morphologic review in the light of the RT-PCR results showed very rare abnormal eosinophils in cases UPN 12 and UPN 13 , but not in UPN 14 , such rare events have little value in routine use for classification purposes .
Sporadic reports of inv ( 16 ) in AML M4 exist but occur too infrequently to allow accurate assessment of their incidence . ``
The 10 % incidence reported here suggests its frequency may have been underestimated .
The well-recog-nized association of inv ( 16 ) /t ( 16 ; 16 ) and M4Eo may introduce a slight bias in both the frequency of karyotype analysis and the effort expended in searching for chromosome 16 abnormalities once typical eosinophil abnormalities have been detected .
Such a bias would tend to underestimate the number of cases with inv ( 16 ) in the group without eosinophil abnormalities .
The CBFS-MYH11 RT-PCR results presented here are in keeping with this possibility .
Analysis of a larger number of AML M4 by either RT-PCR or FISH with appropriate probes will be necessary to determine whether this incidence is representative .
If this proves to be the case , it will be interesting to determine whether it is the presence of a fusion transcript or the eosinophil abnormalities which confer an improved prognosis .
Two patients , one AML M4Eo ( UPN 3 ) and one AML M4 ( UPN 12 ) , considered not to have chromosome 16 abnor- POIREL ET AL malities by standard karyotype analysis showed MYH11 fusion transcripts .
In the first case , only 4 metaphases were analyzable and the value of this negative result is therefore limited .
In contrast , 35 mitoses were analyzed by G banding in UPN 12 and both chromosome 16s were considered normal , both initially and after review in light of the PCR findings .
Interestingly , this case showed an isolated trisomy 22 .
Trisomy 22 is a rare finding in AML , occurring in only 2 % of cases , but is associated with an inv ( 16 ) in ~45 % of cases . ``
'' The RT-PCR result was confirmed in both cases by demonstration of MYH11 rearrangement by Southern and residual positivity in UPN 12 in apparent complete remission .
Molecular detection of tumor-specific fusion transcripts in karyotype-negative cases at diagnosis is well recognized with several other recurrent chromosomal trans-locations , including BCR-ABL and t ( 9 ; 22 ) , `` ' E2A-PBX1 and 19 ) , ETO-AML1 and t ( 8 ; 21 ) `` `` * and MLL and abnormalities of chromosome 11423 . ``
The frequency with which such discrepancies exist correlates with the ability to obtain adequate metaphases , the coexistence of normal metaphases and the difficulty of karyotypic detection of certain chromosomal rearrangements .
The latter represents a particular problem in detection of chromosome 16 abnormalities , especially when R-banding techniques are used . ``
While the use of whole chromosome 16 paints will not improve karyotypic detection of these abnormalities , cosmid or YAC probes specific for the 16p13 or 16q22 breakpoints will provide useful methods of confirmation of CBFS-MYH11-positive , karyotype-negative cases , .
`` ** `` Unfortu-nately , no mitoses were available for FISH analysis from either UPN 3 or 12 .
Such techniques will also be useful in the analysis of complex chromosome 16 abnormalities , as in the case of UPN 10 from this series .
These results show that standard karyotype analysis may underestimate the incidence of chromosome abnormalities and that it should be complemented by either FISH or RT-PCR analysis .
Analysis of dilutions of RNA from diagnostic samples showed that this technique permits the detection of minority clonal populations when they represent as little as 10~* of the sample analyzed in nested PCR , thus showing a sensitivity similar to that of Claxton et al . '
'' In keeping with this , all three patients tested , albeit early , in complete hematologic remission remained RT-PCR positive .
These results show that evaluation of such a system for the follow-up of patients is merited .
The coding sequence remains largely intact in the CBFG-MYH11 fusion transcript , losing only the 3 ' part that codes for the last 17 amino acids .
CBF/ # forms a heterodimer with CBFa/AML1 , involved in the t ( 8 ; 21 ) , associated predominantly with AML M2 , but in the remaining 10 % of cases with AML M4 . ``
The murine homologue of CBF , PEBp2/ $ , does not bind directly to DNA but rather increases the intrinsic binding affinity of AMLI/CBFa to its target DNA sequence by decreasing its dissociation rate '* .
CBF binds to the enhancers of various T lymphotropic murine leukemia viruses `` and to similar motifs in the enhancers of several genes specifically expressed in T cells , including CD2 , `` CD3e and the TCRa `` , TCRy `` ® and TCR8 `` genes , where mutations of the binding site lead to From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

CHROMOSOME 16 CBFS-MYH11 a reduction in enhancer activity of the TCR # and TCRA genes . ``
In this context , it is interesting to note that one case ( UPN 14 ) of CBF3-MYH11-positive AML M4 later developed an angiocentric T-cell lymphoma , as previously reported .
* ' Angiocentric T-cell lymphomas are characterized by a polymorphic infiltrate , often including a substantial eosinophilic component , which is thought to be at least partly caused by the production of various cytokines by the T-cell clone , in particular interleukin-5 .
* The association between eosinophilia and T lymphoproliferative disorders is well rec-ognized . ``
The demonstration of deregulation of a transcription factor important in T-cell development and function in a myeloid malignancy characterized by abnormal eosinophil development and usually by eosinophilia raises several interesting questions .
Further studies of the functional consequences of the CBFP-MYH11 fusion transcript are clearly required .
The recent demonstration that regulates the expression of two myeloid specific genes , myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase , suggest one interesting possible di-rection . ``
In the meantime , the ability to detect it by RT-PCR will refine our ability to evaluate prognosis and response to treatment in patients with AML M4 .
