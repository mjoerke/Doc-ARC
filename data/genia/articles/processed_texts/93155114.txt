Characterization of the Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Components of the Lymphoid-specific Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells ( NF-AT ) Complex * ( Received for publication , September 3 , 1992 ) Jeffrey P. Northrop , Katharine S. Ullman , and Gerald R. Crabtreet From the Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California 94305 The lymphoid-specific transcription complex , NF-AT , is involved in early gene activation in T cells and is assembled from a pre-existing , T cell restricted cytoplasmic factor and an inducible ubiquitous nuclear component within 30 min after activation through the antigen receptor .
Recent studies have implicated the family of API factors as components of the murine NF-AT complex .
Evidence is provided here that the nuclear component of human NF-AT contains the phorbol es-ter-inducible transcription factor APL ( Jun/Fos ) .
We further characterize which API family members can assume this role .
Antisera to Fos inhibits NF-AT DNA binding as does an oligonucleotide containing a binding site for AP1 .
Constitutive expression in vivo of Fos , and to a lesser extent Fra-1 , eliminates the requirement for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) stimulation , leaving NF-AT-directed transcription responsive to calcium ionophore alone .
Overexpression of cJun or JunD , but not JunB , also eliminates the requirement for PMA , indicating that many but not all Jun- and Fos-related proteins functionally activate NF-AT-dependent transcription in the presence of the cytoplasmic component .
NF-AT DNA binding can be reconstituted in vitro using semi-purified AP 1 proteins mixed with cytosol from T lymphocytes .
Fos proteins are not needed for this reconstitution , and although JunB is not functional , it can participate in the NF-AT DNA binding complex .
Finally , we have partially purified the cytoplasmic component of NF-AT and show by elution and renaturation from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels that it has a molecular mass between 94 and 116 kDa and may have multiple dif-ferentially modified forms .
The specificity of the immune response is largely derived from the ability of the antigen receptor of T lymphocytes to rapidly induce the production of cytokines that in turn control cell fate decisions , proliferation , and differentiation of B cells , macrophages , granulocytes , and other cell types necessary for an effective immune response ( 1-3 ) .

implicated NF-AT `` as a specific nuclear target for the antigen receptor conveying its specificity to the early activation cytokines ( 4-6 ) .
Although the molecular makeup of NF-AT is at present unknown , recent studies ( 7 ) have shown that NF-AT can be reconstituted from a ubiquitous nuclear component that requires protein synthesis for induction and a T cell-specific constitutive cytoplasmic component ( NF-AT , ) .
This cytoplasmic component associates with the nucleus in response to calcium signaling in a manner that is inhibited by the immunosupressive drugs cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 .
Like the nuclear component of NF-AT , API activity can be induced in many different cell types .
AP1 can contain any one of a group of related proto-oncogenes , the Jun family ( 8-12 ) , which are capable of binding to specific responsive elements as homodimers ( 8-13 ) or as heterodimers with the product of the c-fos gene ( 13-17 ) or with other Fos-related proteins ( 18-20 ) .
The nuclear component of NF-AT can be induced with PMA , is not sensitive to CsA or FK506 , and can be seen in cells of non-T cell origin such as HeLa ( 7 ) and Cos cells . ``
Transcription of the proto-oncogene c-fos occurs within 30 min following treatment of T cells with PMA ( 21 , 22 ) and is insensitive to CsA and FK506 ( 22 ) .
In light of these simi-larities , we have investigated whether Fos or a Fos-related antigen ( Fra ) might participate in the formation of the NF-AT complex .
Recent studies ( 23 ) have implicated Fos as a component of the murine NF-AT complex ; however , the antisera used in this work recognizes the Fos M peptide which is essentially conserved in every Fos-related protein thus far identified including FosB , FosB2 , Fra-1 , and Fra-2 ( 18-20 ) .
The nuclear portion of the murine NF-AT complex binds to an oligonucleotide derived from the IL-2 enhancer containing a 6 of 7 base pair match with a consensus AP1 binding site and may contain one of the known Jun proteins ( 23 ) .
Using a T cell line expressing the SV40 T antigen , we have characterized the nuclear and cytoplasmic components of human NF-AT .
We find that any of three Jun family members can complement T cell cytosol to form NF-AT binding activity in vitro but only eJun and JunD , not JunB , are able to functionally replace PMA induction of this component in vivo .
Both Fos and Fra-1 can functionally replace PMA in-duction , and although Fos protein can participate in NF-AT DNA binding activity , it is not necessary ; Jun alone can form 'The abbreviations used are : NF-AT , nuclear factor of activated T cells ; HNF-1 @ , hepatocyte nuclear factor-l1a ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; IL-2 , interleukin-2 ; Oct-1 , octamer factor-1 ; Fra , Fos-related antigen ; CsA , cyclosporin A ; Tag , T antigen ; PAGE , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ; PMSF , phenylmethylsulfonyl flu-oride ; DTT , dithiothreitol ; PAGE , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ; CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase .

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Jurkat Cells Expressing SV40 T Antigen-The human T cell line , Jurkat , was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum in a 5 % CO , humidified atmosphere .
A construct for expression of SV40 T antigen , RSV Tag , was constructed by cloning a 2.6-kilbase pair HindIII/BamHI fragment of SV40 in place of ther CAT gene in RSVCAT ( 24 ) .
A similar construct , RSVneo , was made by inserting the neomycin resistance gene ( HindIII/BamHI fragment ) from pSV2neo ( 25 ) in place of the CAT gene in RSVCAT .
The RSV neo cassett was removed with Ndel/BamHI and blunted into the unique Apal site of RSV Tag forming RSV Tagneo .
Twenty ug of this plasmid was linearized with BamHI and electroporated ( 240 V , 960 uF ) into the NF-AT lacZ-positive cell line J.NFATZ.1 ( 26 ) .
Selections were done using G418 ( 1 mg/ml ) until resistant clones grew out .
Expression of T antigen in individual clones was assayed by ribonuclease protection and by immunofluorescence .
Clone 15 , TagC15 , expresses approximately 30 % as much T antigen mRNA as do Cos cells and contains positive nuclear staining for the T antigen .
These cells consistently express higher levels of transfected genes driven from SVA40 origin-containing vectors as compared with non-T antigen-containing Jurkat cells `` and have been used extensively for expression of a variety of proteins ( 27 , 28 ) .
Gel Mobility Shifts-A nuclear extract from Jurkat T cells stimulated for 3 h. with 20 ng/ml PMA ( Sigma ) and 2 um ionomycin ( Calbiochem ) was prepared as described ( 26 ) .
Rat liver nuclear extract was a generous gift of D. Mendel and was prepared as described ( 27 ) .
Nuclear extracts were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 50 mm NaCl , 0.5 mm EDTA , 5 % glycerol , and 1.7 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) with or without antisera ( 0.5 ul ) or competitor oligonucleotides ( 25 ng , 200-fold excess ) .
End-labeled oligonucleotide probes were then added to each mixture and incubations carried out for another 45 min at room temperature .
DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4 % polyacrylamide , 0.5 x TBE ( 1 x TBE : 0.089 m Tris base , 0.081 M boric acid , 0.002 m EDTA , pH 8.4 ) -containing gels .
Oligonucleotide probes were as follows , NF-AT ( 5-GATCTAAGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATGGATC-3 ' ) , AP1 ( 5'-TCGAGTGACTCAGCGCGTCGA-3 ' ) , Oct- ( 5-GATCTTT-GAAAATATGTGTAATATGTAAAACATTTTGGATC-3 ' ) , __ and HNF ( 828 probe as defined , Ref .

The sequence of the immunoglobulin « -chain enhancer E-box containing oligonucleotide is as follows : Antisera to HNF-1a has been described ( 27 ) as has the antisera to Fos ( 30 ) .
Antisera specific for JunD was raised in Balb/c mice using a protein containing a region of human JunD ( gift of N. Nomura ) spanning from amino acid 44 to 193 fused to the carboxyl terminus of gluta-thione S-transferase ( Pharmacia ) .

Transfections-Luciferase reporter constructs were as follows .
NF-ATLuc was provided by Peter Kao and contains three copies of the NF-AT binding site ( -286 to -257 of human IL-2 ) linked to the human IL-2 promoter ( -72 to +47 ) driving luciferase ( 31 ) .
NFxBLuc contains three copies of the human immunoglobulin « -chain enhancer B site ( 22 ) in place of the three NF-AT binding sites , and IL-2Luc contains the human IL-2 enhancer/promoter sequence -326 to +47 .
The expression constructs SVFos , RSVeJun , RSVJunB , and RSVJunD encoding murine cFos , cJun , JunB , and JunD , respectively , were a gift of M. Yaniv .
An expression vector for murine JunD tagged with 6 histidine residues at the amino terminus was constructed by placing the coding region of murine jun ) into the bacterial expression vector QE-9 ( Quiagen ) .
An EcoRI fragment containing the sequences encoding the histidine tail as well as the entire open reading frame of junD was then cloned into the EcoRI site of pBJ5 , placing it under the control of the SRa « promoter .
These manipulations added the sequence Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His-Gly-Ser-Pro to the amino end of JunD .
Transfection of this construct into Jurkat cells indicates that it remains functional . ``
An expression vector for murine cFos tagged with 6 histidine residues at the amino terminus was constructed by cloning genomic sequences between the unique Bgll site and the Nae !
site immediately downstream from the stop codon into the vector QE-9 .
A fragment containing the histidine tag and these genomic sequences was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBJ5 as above .
This procedure removed the first 21 amino acids of Fos and replaced them with the sequence Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His-His- His- His-His-His-Gly-Ser-Val-Asp .
This construct also remains functional as assayed by transfection into Jurkat cells . ``
Expression vectors for rat cFos and rat Fra-1 were constructed by cloning EcoRI fragments containing the entire coding sequence for each of these proteins into the EcoRI site of pBJ5 .
Jurkat cells expressing the SV40 T antigen were transiently transfected by electroporation ( 240 V , 960 LF ) with luciferase-based reporter constructs for NF-AT , NFxB , and the IL-2 enhancer/promoter and with expression vectors for cFos , Fra-1 , cJun , JunB JunD , or pBJ5 control plasmid .
Each transfection contained 2 ug of reporter plasmid and 4 ug of expression construct .
Stimulations with 2 aM ionomycin plus or minus 20 ng/ml PMA were started 24 h after transfection and were allowed to proceed for 7 h before harvesting cells for luciferase assays ( 31 ) .

After 36 h , whole cell extracts were prepared by suspending cells in 300 Ll of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES , pH 7.8 , 0.4 m KCI , 20 % glycerol , 2 mM DTT , and 0.2 mm PMSF on ice .
This cell suspension was frozen and thawed on ice two times and then spun at 100,000 x g for 12 min at 4 °C .

The column was washed with buffer B containing 80 mM KCl and 20 mM imidazole ( 3 X 200 ul ) 2919 and then bound proteins were eluted with three 150-4l aliquots of buffer B containing 80 mM KCl and 100 mM imidazole .
Aliquots of the column load and flow-through ( 0.7 % of total , 5 ul ) and elutions ( 3.3 % of total , 5 ul ) were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted with the -specific antisera described above .
Binding of the primary antisera was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody ( Zymed ) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system ( Amersham Corp. ) .
Ni # * column fractions ( elution 2 , 5 Ll total ) , either alone or mixed with cytoplasmic extract ( 5 ug , prepared as described ( 7 ) ) , plus or minus competitor oligonucleotide ( 25 ng ) were allowed to associate for 15 min in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 40 mm NaCl , 0.5 mm EDTA , 5 % glycerol , and 300 ng of poly ( dI-dC ) before addition of labeled oligonucleotide .
Reactions were further processed as described above under gel mobility shifts .
Denaturation and Renaturation of NF-AT -Crude Jurkat cytosol was enriched approximately 50-fold in NF-ATc activity by ammo-nium sulfate fractionation and ion exchange chromatography . ``
This material ( 250 ug ) was further fractionated by reducing SDS-PAGE .
Gel slices were crushed and proteins eluted for 15 h at 25 °C in 1.5 ml of elution buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCL , pH 7.9 , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 % SDS , 5 mm DTT , 150 mm NaCl , and 40 ug/ml bovine serum albumin ) .
After removal of gel , proteins were precipitated with 9 volumes of ice-cold acetone and recovered by centrifugation .
Pellets were dissolved in 50 Ll of denaturing buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7.5 , 10 % glycerol , 0.1 mM EDTA , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 0.03 % lauryldimethylamine oxide , and 6 M guanidine HCl ) and incubated 30 min at 25°C .
Samples were dialyzed against buffer B above containing 50 mM KCl and 0.1 mM EDTA in a system 100 microdialyzer ( Pierce Chemical Co. ) .
Aliquots of these samples ( 1 wl ) and 5 ug of enriched NF-AT ' c starting material were analyzed by SDS-PAGE .
NF-ATc was assayed in 10 ul of these fractions by mixing with 4 ug of nuclear extract prepared from HeLa cells stimulated for 2 h with 20 ng/ml PMA as described ( 7 ) .
Gel shift conditions were as described above under `` Gel Mobility Shifts . ``
RESULTS As shown previously ( 23 ) , an antisera against the conserved M peptide region of Fos ( 30 ) inhibited NF-AT binding activity from nuclear extracts of Jurkat T cells ; however , there is no inhibition by an antisera which recognizes hepatocyte nuclear factor-1a ( HNF-1a ) , a liver-enriched transcription factor not found in T cells ( 27 ) ( Fig .
14 , lanes 1-3 ) .
As expected , similar results with the anti-M peptide antisera were found using an oligonucleotide to detect AP1 binding proteins ( Fig .
14 , lanes 4-6 ) .
In contrast , no inhibition is seen of Oct-1 DNA binding ( lanes 7-9 ) or of HNF-la DNA binding ( lanes 10-12 ) .
The HNF-1a @ antisera induces a supershift of of slower mobility ( lane 12 ) as observed previously ( 27 ) .
To investigate whether an entire AP1 binding activity forms a component of NF-AT , we performed competitions with the cognate binding sites for these two factors ( Fig .
1B ) .
As expected , AP1 binding activity was effectively competed by excess API oligonucleotide but not by the binding site for NF-AT or the « E2 site of the immunoglobulin « enhancer ( lanes 5-8 ) .
This implies that the NF-AT binding site does not contain a cryptic API binding site .
Surprisingly , while the « E2 site does not compete for the NF-AT binding activity , the API site competes effectively ( lanes 1-4 ) .
These results suggest that NF-AT contains an API binding activity and that Fos or a Fra can participate in the formation of the nuclear component of NF-AT .
To determine if AP1 binding proteins could replace the requirement for PMA stimulation in NF-AT-directed transcription , we cotransfected either murine or rat c-fos with a reporter gene under the direction of NF-AT .
Complete independence from PMA stimulation is observed , whereas the requirement for a calcium signal remains intact ( Fig .
24 ) .
Murine Fos appears more effective than rat Fos in this assay .
Cotransfection of an expression vector for rat Fra-1 , which was isolated by virtue of the fact that it is immunologically cross-reactive with Fos ( 32 ) , also replaces the PMA signal , although less efficiently than rat Fos .

c-fos cotransfection on NFxB- or IL-2-directed transcription ( Fig .
2B ) , indicating that Fos can not substitute for all PMA generated signals necessary for IL-2 expression .
Since Fos does not bind to an API site as a monomer or homodimer ( 14-17 ) , it seemed likely that the competition results in Fig .
1B could best be explained if Fos or a Fra were complexed with a Jun protein capable of binding to an API site .
Cotransfection of expression vectors for either c-jun or junD resulted in partial independence from the PMA signal for induction of NF-AT transcriptional activity , whereas expression of jun B had no effect ( Fig .
24 ) .
To show directly that Jun proteins are capable of participating in NF-AT DNA binding activity , we overexpressed JunD tagged with histidine and nontagged Fos in Jurkat cells which constitutively express SV40 T antigen .
Extracts from these cells were passed over Ni**-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity columns and eluted with imidazole .
A Western blot using a JunD-specific antisera shows that the His-tagged JunD is found predominantly in the second fraction eluted from the column , whereas the column flow-through is effectively depleted ( Fig .
3A , upper panel ) .
In contrast , wild-type JunD remains in the flow-through and is not eluted off the Ni** column ( Fig .
3A , lower panel ) .
To control for nontagged proteins in the extract which elute with the His-tagged JunD , the second elution fraction from each column was used in reconstitution experiments ( Fig .
3B ) .
Although neither Jurkat cytosol nor the HisJunD elution alone contain NF-AT binding activity ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , mixing these two fractions ( lane 3 ) resulted in regeneration of NF-AT binding activity which is specifically competed by excess NF-AT oligonucleotide but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide ( lanes 8 and 9 ) .
The wild-type JunD does not appear in the column elution and , as expected , this elution is incapable of reconstituting an NF-AT gel shift ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Thus the ability to regenerate NF-AT DNA binding activity correlates with the presence of JunD protein .

Finally , Cos cell cytosol alone or when combined with the HisJunD elution ( lanes 6 and 7 ) fails to regenerate NF-AT binding activity .
This confirms the T cell-specific nature of the cytosolic component ( 7 ) .

are coexpressed ( lane 4 ) .
We interpret these results as indicating the presence of Jun/Jun homodimers ( upper band ) and Jun/Fos heterodimers ( lower band ) .
Since expression of JunD alone replaces the PMA requirement for NF-AT-directed transcription , we tested whether JunD alone could reconstitute NF-AT DNA binding in the presence of the cytoplasmic component .
Addition of cytosol to JunD homodimers ( Fig .
4 , lanes 7-9 ) results in reconstituted NF-AT DNA binding with the correct specificity ( lanes 10-12 ) .
This result is consistent with the functional data presented above .
For comparison , reconstitution using coexpressed JunD and Fos is shown in Fig .
44 , lanes 1-6 .
Jurkat cells do not express Fos in the absence of PMA stimulation ( 22 ) ; however , JunD is expressed at low levels in nonstimu-lated Jurkat cells `` and therefore is available to pair with exogenously expressed Fos .
This may explain why expression of Fos or Fra-1 alone can functionally replace the PMA signal .
To investigate whether Fos alone could reconstitute NF-AT DNA binding , cytosol was added to the nickel column elution shown in Fig .
3D , lane 2 , and in Fig .
4A , lanes 13-15 .
A very small amount of NF-AT can be detected ( compare lanes 16 and 25 ) .
These results indicate that the functional assay with the luciferase reporter is far more sensitive than the gel shift assay .
Coexpression of JunD with HisFos results in a large amount of Jun/Fos heterodimer ( Fig .
44 , lanes 19-21 ) and consequently a large increase in the amount of reconstituted NF-AT ( lanes 22-24 ) .
As shown in Fig .
3 , the reconstituted NF-AT DNA binding activity correlates with the presence of immunoreactive JunD .
As expected , JunD is easily detected in fractions able to reconstitute appreciable NF-AT DNA binding ( Fig .
4B ) with the exception of HisFos/JunD ( Fig .
4B , lane 12 , E2 ) .
A longer exposure of this blot shows some JunD copurifying with the HisFos ( data not shown ) , indicating that the Western blot is yet less sensitive than the gel shift assay .
Since JunB is unable to transactivate the NF-ATLuc reporter ( Fig .
24 ) , we determined whether it could participate in the NF-AT complex .
Coexpression of JunB with HisFos enhances reconstituted NF-AT DNA binding as ° K. Ullman and G. Crabtree , unpublished observations .
did JunD ( Fig .
44 ) .
This indicates that JunB can participate in a nonfunctional NF-AT complex .
To begin characterization of the cytoplasmic component of NF-AT , we fractionated Jurkat cytosol enriched in NF-ATc by SDS-PAGE and renatured proteins eluted form gel slices .
These fractions are shown in Fig 5A .
Using HeLa nuclear extract as a source of the nuclear component ( 7 ) , we were able to reconstitute NF-AT DNA binding activity specifically from three fractions ( fractions 4-6 , Fig .
5B ) but mostly from fraction 5 ( 94-116 kDa ) .
The reconstituted complexes migrate slower in the gel with higher molecular mass fractions , and each forms a subset of the migration of the NF-AT reconstituted from the starting material ( L ) .
This may indicate the presence of multiple forms of the cytoplasmic component .
DISCUSSION Based on our results , we propose that human NF-AT contains both a PMA-inducible and relatively ubiquitous API binding activity , forming the nuclear component , as well as a T cell-restricted cytosolic component .
Recent work ( 23 ) has implicated AP1 in the formation of the inducible murine NF-AT complex .
Our results confirm this notion for the human NF-AT complex .
We further show that expression of Fos , Fra , and Jun proteins can eliminate the need for PMA induction of the nuclear component and characterize which Jun proteins are functional and which are able to reconstitute NF-AT binding in the presence of the cytosolic component .
The nuclear component of human NF-AT appears to contain both a Jun family member and Fos or a Fra .
Functionally , both eJun and JunD operate to replace the PMA requirement as does Fos and Fra-1 .
Although the effect of cJun or JunD is not nearly as pronounced as that of Fos , this may reflect known differences between the transcriptional activation potential of cJun homodimers as compared with cJun/Fos heterodimers at a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element ( 15 , 36 ) .
Although JunB is able to participate in the NF-AT complex , it is not able to activate an NF-AT-dependent reporter .
This finding is provocative given previous studies ( 37 , 38 ) showing differences in the transactivation Components of NF-AT potential and mutual antagonism between cJun and JunB on certain 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element constructs and in malignant transformation assays .
There is some evidence ( 23 ) that NF-ATc can bind a specific DNA sequence independently of the nuclear component .
Thus , given the similarities between NF-AT and API transactivation with regard to the activities of various Jun and Fos family members , NF-AT may serve to couple API to a new DNA binding site where Jun and Fos contribute all transcriptional activation functions .
Antibody inhibition and functional studies implicate Fos or a Fra as a participant in the NF-AT complex .
Although the native NF-AT complex includes Fos or a Fra , we have shown both functionally and by reconstitution of DNA binding activity that Fos is not necessary and that cJun and JunD are sufficient to replace the nuclear component .
Expression of Fos of Fra-l1 functionally activate NF-AT-dependent transcription in the presence of likely because of consti-tuitive low level expression of Jun proteins in Jurkat cells .
The Fos gene family contains a number of members already and is likely to grow ; thus it remains a formal possibility that the native NF-AT complex in Jurkat cells contains an as yet unidentified Fra , pairing with Jun .
NF-AT , not only serves to couple API to the NF-AT DNA binding site but also imparts dependence on a calcium flux and , thus , sensitivity to CsA and FK506 .
Therefore , with regard to calcium-mediated signal transduction in T cells and immunosupressant action , NF-ATc is a key component .
We have partially purified this protein and shown it to have a molecular mass between 94 and 116 kDa .
NF-ATc is present in more than one molecular mass range , indicating some heterogeneity in this factor .
This heterogeneity is unlikely due to proteolysis during the denaturation-renaturation steps as the mobility of the reconstituted complexes all fall within the range of the native NF-AT complex isolated from the nuclei of stimulated Jurkat cells .
Purification and cloning of the gene for NF-ATc will be necessary to fully answer these questions .
Although the full nature of the cytosolic component of NF-AT is not known , the complex formed with API acquires the specificity of NF-AT , thereby explaining how a ubiquitous transcription factor like AP1 can contribute to the biologically specific pattern of early gene activation in T cells .
