1 Involvement of Transcription Factor YB-1 in Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type I Basal Gene Expression FATAH KASHANCHI , JANET F. DUVALL , JURGEN DITTMER , ALIDAD MIRESKANDARLI , ROBERT L. REID , SCOTT D. GITLIN , anp JOHN N. BRADY* Laboratory of Molecular Virology , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 Received 12 August 1993/Accepted 19 October 1993 Sequences which control basal human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) transcription likely play an important role in initiation and maintenance of virus replication .
We previously identified and analyzed a 45-nucleotide sequence ( downstream regulatory element 1 [ DRE 1 ] ) , +195 to +240 , at the boundary of the R/US5 region of the long terminal repeat which is required for HTLV-I basal transcription .
We identified a protein , p37 , which specifically bound to DRE 1 .
An affinity column fraction , containing p37 , stimulated HTLV-I transcription approximately 12-fold in vitro .
We now report the identification of a cDNA clone ( 15B-7 ) , from a Jurkat expression library , that binds specifically to the DRE 1 regulatory sequence .
Binding of the cDNA fusion protein , similarly to the results obtained with purified Jurkat protein , was decreased by introduction of site-specific mutations in the DRE 1 regulatory sequence .
In vitro transcription and translation of 15B-7 cDNA produced a fusion protein which bound specifically to the HTLV-I +195 to +240 oligonucleotide .
The partial cDNA encodes a protein which is homologous to the C-terminal 196 amino acids of the 36-kDa transcription factor , YB-1 .
Cotransfection of a YB-1 expression plasmid increases HTLV-I basal transcription approximately 14-fold in Jurkat T lymphocytes .
On the basis of the molecular weight , DNA-binding characteristics , and in vivo transactivation activity , we suggest that the previously identified DRE 1-binding protein , p37 , is YB-1 .
The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is associated with a clinically aggressive form of adult T-cell leukemia and the degenerative neuromuscular disease tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy .
HTLV-I gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by viral gene products Tax , ( p40** ) and Rex , ( p27 ) ( 1 , 10 , 15 , 35 ) .
The U3 region of the HTLV-I long terminal repeat ( LTR ) contains several important elements needed for Tax , ; transactivation .
The 21-bp repeat elements ( Tax , -responsive element 1 [ TRE-1 ] ) confer Tax ; responsiveness to the HTLV-I and heterologous promoters , function in either orientation , and interact with Tax , indirectly ( 6 , 11 , 24 , 31 , 34 ) .
In addition , Tax , -responsive element 2 ( TRE-2 ) contains binding sites for Ets1 , Myb , Sp1 , and TIF-1 ( 4 , 5 , 12 , 23 , 28 ) .
Sequences downstream of the RNA initiation site , encompassing the R region and the 5 ' portion of the US region , have been shown to be important for basal gene expression ( 17 , 22 , 27 , 33 ) .
Nakamura et al .
( 27 ) reported that sequences from +104 to +240 were important for HTLV-I basal gene expression .
In agreement with this report , Seiki et al .
( 33 ) reported that sequences between +32 and +266 were important for HTLV-I basal mRNA synthesis .
The downstream element was orientation independent but was effective only when it was located between the transcription initiation site and the translation initiation site .
The downstream element was not Tax ; responsive .
A distinct regulatory element ( 33 ) , which may function as an RNA element , is located between +266 and +347 .
In addition , we have previously shown that sequences from +195 to +240 ( downstream regulatory element 1 [ DRE 1 ] ) downstream of the start site at the R/US region are * Corresponding author .

561 important for basal transcription .
A cellular protein of 37 kDa was responsible for specific binding to this region and transac-tivating the promoter ( 17 ) .
We now report the cloning and identification of a transcription factor which binds and transactivates the HTLV-I LTR through the DRE 1 regulatory sequence .
A lambda gt11 Jurkat cDNA expression library was screened to isolate proteins which specifically interacted with a *°P-labeled +195 to +240 oligonucleotide probe .
The cDNA library was plated at 10° PFU on Escherichia coli Y¥1090 and induced with 10 mM IPTG ( isopropylthiogalactoside ) -soaked nitrocellulose membrane .
Nitrocellulose filters were denatured and renatured with guanidinium hydrochloride as described previously ( 39 ) .
For screening , membranes were blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk in TNE 200 ( 50 mM Tris [ pH 8.0 ] , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA ) for 2 h at 4°C and subsequently incubated with approximately 5 x 10° cpm of P-radiolabeled +195 to +240 oligonucleotide probe per ml ( 10° cpm/pmo !
l ) and poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia ) for 2 h at 4°C .
Filters were washed three times in TNE 200 at room temperature .
After four rounds of screening , we isolated a recombinant lambda phage which expressed a fusion protein capable of specifically binding to the HTLV-I downstream regulatory sequences .
The wild-type +195 to +240 oligonucleotide , but not a five-base-substitution mutant ( 17 ) , specifically bound to recombinant clone 15B-7 ( data not shown ) .
The five-base-substitution mutant of oligonucleotide +195 to +240 was previously shown to decrease binding of the Jurkat DRE 1-binding protein , p37 ( 17 ) .
Recombinant phage clone 15B-7 was subsequently se-quenced , by using multiple overlapping primers ( Fig .
1 ) .
Computer analysis of the 15B-7 amino acid sequence demonstrated greater than 99 % homology , over a 196-amino-acid stretch , to the C-terminal domain of a previously identified transcription factor , YB-1 ( Fig .
1 ) .

Sequence analysis of lambda gt11 cDNA clone 15B-7 and comparison with human YB-1 and human DNA-binding protein A ( 38 ) .
A single positive plaque was aspirated into a tube containing lambda gt11 primers 1218 and 1222 ( New England Biolabs ) and PCR amplified , and the cDNA was subcloned into the pCRII plasmid ( Invitrogen ) for both DNA sequencing and DNA expression .
The 15B-7 amino acid sequence was homologous to the C-terminal 196 amino acids of YB-1 , except for glutamic acid at position 151 , which was replaced with alanine .
Interesting features including a conserved C-terminal box ( CI ) , a protamine-like domain ( [ + ] ) , and an acidic amino acid domain ( [ < 3 ) are indicated .
specifically and transactivates the Y-box sequence containing an inverted CCAAT box ( 8 ) .
To determine whether , in fact , YB-1 was able to regulate transcription of the HTLV-I LTR , we obtained a eukaryotic expression vector containing YB-1 ( a generous gift of B. D. Schwartz ) .
The YB-1 expression plasmid was transfected along with HTLV-I wild-type or mutant reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) plasmids into Jurkat cells as described previously ( 17 ) .
Extracts were prepared 18 h after transfection for CAT assays .
Results of such an experiment are shown in Fig .
2A .
Cotransfection of the +246 HTLV-I promoter CAT plasmid with Tax , led to a 32Z-fold increase in CAT gene expression ( Fig .
2A , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
Similarly , cotransfection of the YB-1 expression plasmid , in increasing amounts , led to a maximal stimulation of approximately 14-fold ( Fig .
2A , lanes 3 to 5 ) .
An apparent squelching effect was observed at higher concentrations of input YB-1 .
The YB-1 transactivation is not seen with plasmids that do not contain downstream sequences beyond +202 ( Fig .
2A , lanes 8 to 15 ) .
We next analyzed the binding of YB-1 to the sequence +195 to +240 in a band shift assay .
Figure 2B shows the result of such an experiment ; specific binding is seen with an extract that J. Viror .

The HTLV-I +195 to +240 sequence contains the sequence ( +210 to +222 ; the underlined bases differ from the consensus YB-1 sequence ) .
The results presented in Fig .

YB-1 RNA analysis of HTLV -- transformed cell lines and HTLV-I Tax , -expressing cells .
( A ) Poly ( A ) * RNAs were prepared from the HTLV-I-transformed cell lines MT-2 , MT-4 , C81 , and Hut 102 and from uninfected Jurkat cells Fourteen micrograms of poly ( A ) * RNA was separated on a 1.2 % denaturing agarose gel , blotted and hybridized under conditions described elsewhere ( 9 ) .
YB-1 cDNA was labeled by [ P ] dCTP to a specific activity of 6 x 10° cpm/pg of DNA by using the primer extension reaction .
The blot was exposed to Kodak XAR X-ray film for 2 h by using an intensifying screen .
Rehybridization with a B-actin-specific probe was carried out as described elsewhere ( 9 ) .
( B ) JPX-9 and JPX/M cells , permanently transformed with a metallothionein-inducible gene encoding native or frameshift mutant Tax ; , respectively ( 26 ) , and Jurkat cells were incubated for 22 h in the absence or presence of 150 wM ZnCl , , and poly ( A ) * RNA was isolated .
Ten micrograms of RNA was used for Northern blot analysis as described previously ( 9 ) .

of YB-1 .
Therefore , we compared YB-1 mRNA levels in the HTLV-I-transformed cell lines MT -2 , MT-4 , C81 , and Hut 102 and control uninfected Jurkat cells .
A Northern ( RNA ) blot was performed with 14 ug of poly ( A ) RNA isolated from each of the cell lines .
The blot was probed with a *°P-labeled YB-1-specific probe as described previously ( 9 ) .

It is possible that mRNA synthesis in cell lines stably expressing HTLV-I viral regulatory proteins would not show continuous elevated expression of inducible mRNAs .
Therefore , we next analyzed the effect of Tax , on YB-1 expression in the Jurkat-derived JPX-9 cell line which is stably transformed with a metallothionein-inducible Tax , gene ( 26 ) .
Of the HTLV-I proteins that are encoded by the viral genome , Tax , has been found to play an important role in cellular transformation and viral gene expression .
In addition , Tax ; has been shown to transactivate a number of cellular genes ( 20 ) .
Upon incubation with 150 wM ZnCl , for 22 h , Tax , ; was expressed at high levels ( Fig .
4B ) .
In contrast , YB-1 mRNA levels were the same in the presence and absence of ZnCl , .
Since the Tax , produced in JPX-9 cells was functional , as determined by transient transfection using the Tax , -responsive HTLV-I LTR-CAT plasmid pU3R-CAT ( data not shown ) , these results suggest that Tax , does not regulate YB-1 expression .
Interestingly , we have also found a YB-1 control element in the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) LTR .
This sequence , 5-CTGATTGGCAGA-3 ' , is present approximately 370 bases upstream of the transcription start site and has been previously footprinted and named site A ( 7 , 29 ) .
Site A is present at the very 5 ' end of the negative regulatory element ( NRE ) , and its function is unknown .
All HIV promoters sequenced to date , except isolates HIVHXB2 ( G to A , 364 bases upstream of the start site ) and HIVREF ( T to C , 366 bases upstream of start site ) , have the above wild-type sequence ( 25 ) .
We examined the effect of YB-1 on two HIV promoter constructs ( Fig .
4A ) ( 3 ) .
The first construct , CD12 , contains the entire HIV promoter .
The second construct , CD7 , contains 273 bases upstream of the RNA start site , deleting the putative YB-1 binding site .
Upon transfection of YB-1 into Jurkat cells along with the HIV LTR-CAT plasmids , an increase in basal transcription with the wild type ( Fig .
4A , lanes 3 to 5 ) , but not the deletion mutant construct ( Fig .
4A , lanes 8 to 10 ) , was observed .
The ability of YB-1 to transactivate HIV transcription has been reproduced in several independent experiments .
As with the results presented above , an apparent squelching effect was observed at higher concentrations of YB-1 ( Fig .

564 NOTES We next analyzed a 15-base oligonucleotide containing the HIV YB-1-box homology , 5¢-CCCTGATTGGCAGAA-3 ' , in a gel shift assay with in vitro-translated 15B-7 .
Figure 4B shows the results of a representative gel shift experiment .
A specific gel shift complex was observed when the HIV YB-1 probe was incubated with in vitro-translated 15B-7 ( Fig .

The gel shift complex was inhibited with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled specific oligonucleotide but not with a 100-fold excess of a five-base mutant ( Fig .

We have previously reported that a 37-kDa protein bound specifically to the HTLV-I DRE 1 regulatory sequence ( 17 ) .
Using a radiolabeled DRE 1 probe , we have identified a partial cDNA clone ( 15B-7 ) from a Jurkat lambda gt11 cDNA library which binds specifically to DRE 1 .
The DNA-binding properties of the 15B-7 protein were similar to those of p37 .
Interestingly , the amino acid sequence of Jurkat cDNA clone 15B-7 was identical to the C-terminal 196 amino acids of the 36-kDa transcription factor YB-1 .
Moreover , cotransfection of YB-1 with the HTLV-I LTR resulted in a sequence-specific transactivation .
On the basis of the similar molecular weight , DNA-binding properties , and in vivo transactivation , we speculate that the previously identified DRE 1 binding protein , p37 , was YB-1 .
Several distinct families of proteins which bind to the Y-box sequence have been identified .
YB-1 family members have been found to be markedly conserved in sequence throughout evolution from bacteria to vertebrates ( 19 , 40 ) .
Several functions have been associated with YB-1 .
In the chicken , YB-1 expression in carly liver development is positively associated with DNA synthesis or cell proliferation ( 14 ) .
Interestingly , YB-1 family members in Xenopus frogs , FRG Y1 and FRG Y2 , have apparent functional differences at various stages of development ( 38 ) .
Expression of YB-1 appears to have limited tissue specificity .
High levels of YB-1 mRNA were present in the heart , muscle , liver , lung , adrenal gland , and brain tissues in a 24-week-old human fetus ( 36 ) .
In contrast , small amounts of YB-1 mRNA were found in the thymus , kidney , bone marrow , and spleen tissues .
In the pancreas , bladder , stomach , and testis tissues , YB-1 mRNA could not be detected by Northern hybridization .
Sequences similar to the Y-box element have been reported to bind transcription factors and effect expression of several promoters such as hsp70 ( 38 ) , thymidine kinase ( 2 , 18 , 21 ) , HLA-DR beta-chain ( 8 ) , mouse ( 2'-5 `` ) oligoadenylate synthetase gene interferon response element ( 41 ) , epidermal growth factor receptor enhancer ( 30 , 37 ) , Rous sarcoma virus LTR ( 30 ) , human papillomavirus type 18 enhancer ( 36 ) , and multidrug resistance gene promoter ( 13 ) .
The YB-1 protein has a number of interesting domains ( Fig .
1 ) .
There is a 68-amino-acid C-terminal domain that is perfectly conserved through evolution and is involved in DNA binding .
This conserved region is followed by stretches of basic amino acids resembling protamine-like domains and acidic amino acids which may form alpha-helices .
Proteins with these characteristics have been postulated to form bridges between distal and proximal regulatory elements of a promoter , stabilizing specific protein-protein interactions by bringing two regions of the same DNA helix into juxtaposition ( 38 ) .
Charge clusters may also contribute to the formation of multiprotein complexes .
Multiple charge clusters within one protein might contribute to cooperative protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions ( 16 ) .
The acidic and basic domains also contain six putative nuclear localization signals ( 8 ) .
The role of YB-1 in the HTLV-I or HIV viral replication cycle remains to be established .
Interestingly , there seems to be increased expression of YB-1 in interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) -induced T J. ViroL .
cells ( 32 ) .
Helper T cells that were stimulated by IL-2 showed expression of several different mRNAs including YB-1 .
Since IL-2 is thought to push cells from G , to S phase , it is speculated that YB-1 is involved in growth-associated gene expression including IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation .
It will be of interest to see whether IL-2-induced genes ( i.e .
, YB-1 ) can stimulate latent viral gene expression and result in active viral replication .
Finally , since YB-1 is a member of a multigene family of related genes , the potential for differential regulation by the distinct family members exists .
