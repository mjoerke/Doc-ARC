BAEUERLE , § and H. W. Loms ZIEGLER-HEITBROCK*|| *Institute for Immunology , $ Department of Internal Medicine , { Department of Surgery , and §Gene Center , University of Munich , Munich , Germany In monocytes , the nuclear factor NF- « B has been invoked as an important transcription factor in the expression of cytokine genes , of cell-surface receptors and in the expression of human immunodeficiency virus .
In such cells , DNA binding activity of NF- « B can be detected without intentional stimulation .
In our studies , cells of the human monocytic line Mono Mac 6 , cultured in medium containing fetal-calf serum and low levels of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , also exhibit such 'constitutive ' NF- « B , as demonstrated by mobility-shift analysis of nuclear extracts .
This nuclear NF- « B was still present when contaminant LPS was removed by ultrafiltration and when serum was omitted .
Protein-DNA complexes of constitutive NF- « B are similar in mobility to the LPS-induced NF-kB and both are recognized by an antibody specific to the p50 subunit of NF- « B .
By contrast , treatment of cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) will only block LPS-induced NF- « B , but not the constitutive binding protein .
Using LPS-free and serum-free conditions , constitutive NF- « B can be detected in different cell lines of the monocytic lineage ( HL60 , U937 , THP -1 , Mono Mac 1 and Mono Mac 6 ) , but not in Molt 4 T cells or K562 stem cells .
When ordered according to stage of maturation , the amount of constitutive NF- « B was not increased in more mature cell lines .
Furthermore , when inducing differentiation in Mono Mac 6 cells , with vitamin D , , no change in constitutive or inducible NF- « B can be detected .
Analysis of primary cells revealed substantial constitutive NF- « B-binding activity in blood monocytes , pleural macrophages and alveolar macrophages .
The constitutive NF- « B appears to be functionally active , since a low level of tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) transcript is detectable in monocytes , and this level can be increased by blocking transcript degradation using cyclo-heximide .
The level of constitutive NF- « B in these cells is variable and is frequently found to be lower in the more mature macrophages .
Constitutive NF- « B was not maintained by autocrine action of cytokines TNF , interleukin 6 , interleukin 10 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or macrophage colony-stimulating factor , since neutralizing antibodies did not reduce constitutive DNA-binding activity .
Furthermore , blockade of prostaglandin or leukotriene biosynthesis did not affect constitutive NF- « B .
The results show that cells of the monocyte system , under conditions that exclude major external stimuli , do show constitutive NF- « B in the nucleus without an apparent correlation to stage of differentiation .
INTRODUCTION The nuclear factor NF- « B has been originally described as a DNA-binding protein interacting with the sequence GGGACT-TTCC in the mouse Ig x light-chain enhancer ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986 ) and thereby inducing transcription of the x light-chain gene .
Subsequent work revealed that NF- « B is important for several other molecules expressed by leucocytes , including cytokines like interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) , and IL-6 ( Hoyos et al .
, 1989 ; Liebermann and Baltimore , 1990 ) .
NF-KB is a heterodimeric p50/p65 protein that is present in the cytoplasm of resting cells in a complex with an inhibitory protein ( IKB ) .
Only after cell activation does IxB dissociate and release NF- « B , which is then transported to the nucleus ( Bauerle and Baltimore , 1988 ) .
The cells of the monocyte system ( myelomonocytic stem cells , bone-marrow monoblasts , blood monocytes , tissue macro-phages ) form a central element in immune defence , in that they are able to phagocytose foreign material , present processed antigen to T cells and orchestrate the immune response by secretion of cytokines , like TNF , IL-1 and IL-6 .
Expression of these cytokines in cells of the monocyte system can be strongly induced by the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and such LPS stimulation also results in mobilization of NF- « B ( Shakhov et al .
, 1990 ; Haas et al .
, 1990 ) .
Quite in contrast with resting T cells , but similar to antibody-producing B cells , constitutive presence of NF-KB in nuclei has been reported for monocytes ( Griffin et al .
, 1989 ; Haas et al .
, 1990 ; Kaufman et al .
, 1992 ) .
In one study it was claimed that constitutive NF- « B will increase with differentiation to mature macrophages ( Griffin et al .
, 1989 ) .
Given the sensitivity of monocytes to activation by various signals and , most noteworthy , from trace amounts of LPS ( Ziegler-Heitbrock et al .
, 1986 ; Taktak et al .
, 1991 ) , one might assume that such constitutive mobilization is , in fact , induced inadvertently by exogenous stimuli .
To address this question , we have studied a set of human cell lines under serum-free and LPS-free conditions .
Our data show that in the absence of such exogenous stimuli , cell lines belonging to the monocyte system show constitutive nuclear NF-xB .
In contrast with a previous report , we found , however , no apparent increase during differentiation .

The plasma layer , containing the leucocytes , is removed after the erythrocytes have settled ( 30-40 min at room temperature ) .
The plasma is then layered on to NycoPrep 1.068 and centrifuged at 600g for 15 min .
The clear plasma , including interface and NycoPrep solution , is collected and washed twice with 0.9 % NaCl , containing 0.13 % EDTA and 1 % fetal-calf serum ( FCS ) .
Separated monocytes show a purity of about 85-90 % when analysed for CD14 staining in flow cytometry .
Except for the initial sedimentation , all procedures were performed at 4 °C and cells were used for preparation of lysates directly unless stimulated in culture medium with LPS at 1 ug/ml for 1 h at 37 °C .
Alveolar macrophages were recovered by broncho-alveolar lavage from healthy volunteers after informed consent was obtained and after the study had been cleared by the Ethics Committee of the University of Munich .
Lavage was performed with 100 ml of prewarmed 0.9 % NaCl and the fluid recovered was passed through sterile gauze and admixed immediately with an equal volume of RPMI 1640 culture medium at 4°C containing 10 % FCS .
These preparations are > 95 % , macrophages , as assessed by CD14 staining , and they rarely contain bronchial epithelia ( < 0.5 % ) .
Similarly , pleural lavage preparations contain only a few mesothelial cells and are also > 90 % CDI14-positive .
Cell lines Cell lines Mono Mac 1 and Mono Mac 6 were established in this laboratory ( Ziegler-Heitbrock et al .

For this purpose 100 gl of 7TD1 cells were seeded at 5000 cells per well in flat-bottomed microtitre plates together with duplicate twofold serial dilutions of 20 ul culture supernatants .
After culture for 3 days , viable cells were determined with MTT as given above for the TNF assay .
Units of IL-6 were calculated with reference to a recombinant IL-6 standard .

, 1993 ) , followed by 30 min culture with or without LPS at 30 ng/ml .
Preparation of nuclear extracts Cells with or without 1 h stimulation at 37 °C with 1 ug/ml LPS were extracted essentially as described previously ( Haas et al .
, 1990 ) .
In brief , after incubation for 10 min in a hypotonic buffer , they were subjected to cycles of ultrasound ( 5 s each ) , such that over 70 % of the cells were free nuclei .
Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in high-salt buffer .
After 40 min on ice , nuclei were pelleted and the supernatant was diluted with buffer D. Care was taken to add 1 41 of phenyImethanesulphonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) to the preparation at every step of the procedure .
Protein content of the preparation was determined by Coomassie Blue reaction , using the Bio-Rad kit ( cat .

500-0006 ; Bio-Rad , Munich , Germany ) .
If required , aliquotted extracts were stored at -80 °C .
Contamination of nuclear extracts by cytosolic proteins can not be completely excluded with the preparation method used .
Similar results were , however , also obtained with extracts prepared using a Dounce homogenizer .
Furthermore , cytosolic NF- « B is bound to inhibitory proteins ( IxB , C-terminal part of p105 ) , which have to be removed by deoxycholate treatment in order to give binding to their cognate DNA .
Gel-shift analysis Gel shift was performed as described using a **P labelled « B oligonucleotide corresponding to the NF- « B-binding site of the mouse « B light-chain enhancer ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986 ) .
For inhibition studies , labelled oligonucleotide was mixed with 0.25 ng , 2.5 ng and 25 ng excess of unlabelled oligonucleotide derived from the HLA-A , enhancer .
The anti-p50 antibody , kindly provided by A. Israel ( Paris , France ) , was added as 1 wl of undiluted serum to the nuclear extract before addition of the **P 90 M.

Mono Mac 6 cells were cultured for 3 days with or without vitamin D ; ( 160 nM ) .
Cells were then stained with anti-CD14 antibodies My4 or Mo , or the respective isotype controls ( dotted lines ) .
Fluorescence intensity for My4 increased from 557 to 716 channels , and percentage of Mo2 positives from 5 to 87.1 % in this example .
( b ) Effect on NF- « B binding activity .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from the same cells and assayed in gel-shift analysis labelled oligonucleotide .
Samples were run on a 4 % poly-acrylamide gel and the dried gel was applied to an X-ray film at -80 °C overnight .
Northern-blot analysis For Northern-blot analysis , mRNA was isolated using RNAzol B ( WAK , Bad Homburg , Germany ) .
Samples ( 10 ug per lane ) were then separated on an agarose gel and blots were hybridized with oligonucleotide probes labelled with **P by poly ( A ) tailing .
The probes used were as follows : TNF ( Nedwin et al .
, 1985 ) ( residues 89-70 ) 5-GGTCTGGTAGGAGACGGCGATGC-GGCTGATGGTGTGGGTGAGGAGCACATGGGTGGA- and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) ( Dugaiczyk et al .
, 1983 ) ( residues 17-2 ) 5-CCC-TGGTGACCAGGCGGCCAATACGGCCAAATCCGTTG- RESULTS Constitutive NF-xB in Mono Mac 6 cells Nuclear extracts prepared from Mono Mac 6 cells cultured in standard culture medium with FCS demonstrate 'constitutive ' NF- « B-binding activity ( Figure 1 , lane 1 ) and stimulation with LPS for 1 h can strongly increase this activity ( Figure 1 , lane 2 ) .
Culture medium may contain substantial amounts of LPS , introduced by inadvertent contamination , and such contaminating LPS may be responsible for the 'constitutive ' NF- « B-binding activity seen in Mono Mac 6 cells .
The culture medium employed in these initial experiments , when tested by the Limulus assay , in fact contained about 50 pg of LPS/ml .
Culture of Mono Mac 6 cells in medium rendered free of LPS by ultrafiltration did , however , not remove the 'constitutive ' NF- « B binding , and the induction by LPS was still apparent ( Figure 1 , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
The culture medium used contained 10 % FCS and this may have contained additional factors involved in activation of monocytes .
Even with omission of FCS , the NF- « B-binding activity was still clearly evident ( Figure 1 , lane 5 ) .
These results suggest that monocytes may , in fact , be capable of mobilizing NF- « B independent of external signals .
Next we asked whether the constitutive NF- « B detected in Mono Mac 6 cells under these conditions does have properties similar to the LPS-induced nuclear factor .
For this purpose , constitutive binding activity was competed for by a prototypic DNA sequence for NF- « B derived from the human major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I enhancer ( Figure 2a ) .
Non-radioactive double-stranded oligonucleotide was added in increasing amounts ( lanes 2-4 , lanes 6-8 ) to the NF- « B-binding assay .
As shown in Figure 2 ( a ) , the constitutive NF- « B , as well as the LPS-induced NF-KB , is competed for , indicating that both signals have similar specificities .
Furthermore , an antiserum against p50 equally recognized the constitutive and the LPS Constitutive nuclear NF-B in cells of the monocyte lineage 91 induced band , as shown by the further shift to higher molecular mass , due to complexing with the antibody ( Figure 2b , lanes 2 and 5 ) .
Treatment of Mono Mac 6 cells with PDTC did not , however , reduce constitutive NF- « B , while the LPS-induced binding protein was strongly reduced ( Figure 2¢ ) .
In an average of six experiments , LPS-induced NF- « B was reduced by 66.3 + 29.8 % , while the level of constitutive NF- « B in PDTC-treated cells was reduced by 9.6+ 12.6 % , of the untreated control .
Constitutive NF-xB in cell lines of different degrees of maturation When testing a panel of cell lines cultured in FCS-containing LPS-free culture medium , we detected no constitutive NF- « B in Molt4 T cells in K562 haematopoetic stem cells A higher-mobility band seen in these cells and also in THP-1 cells is variable , and in competition analysis turns out to be non-specific { results not shown ) .
The myelomonocytic stem-cell line HL60 does , however , express constitutive NF- « B and the committed U937 line , representing the stage of monoblasts , showed detectable NF- « B binding in untreated cells as well .
Furthermore , the more mature promonocytic lines THP-1 and Mono Mac 1 were positive , as was the most mature monocytic Mono Mac 6 line ( Figure 3 ) .
In contrast with the earlier suggestion that constitutive NF- « B may increase with stage of differentiation ( Griffin et al .
, 1989 ) , we do not see an obvious increase from myelomonocytic stem cells towards monocytic cells .
There was , however , a trend towards higher LPS-inducible NF- « B binding with increasing maturation in that the three promonocytic and monocytic lines exhibited high binding compared with the stem-cell line and the immature monoblastic line .
A similar pattern was observed when cells were cultured in FCS-free medium .
Constitutive NF- « B was still present and there was again no increase with stage of differentiation ( results not shown ) .
Next we asked whether differentiation induction of the Mono Mac 6 cell line will upregulate constitutive NF- « B .
Mono Mac 6 cells treated for 3 days with vitamin D , do show enhanced phagocytosis ( 16.6 in controls , 39.3 + 31.8 in vitamin D , -treated cells ) , and they showed a further upregulation of the CD14 molecule .
The staining of vitamin D , -treated cells with the antibody My4 resulted in an increase of mean fluorescence intensity from 557 to 716 in the example in Figure 4 ( a ) , and the antibody Mo2 stained less than 5 % in untreated and 87.1 % in the vitamin D , -treated Mono Mac 6 cells .
These results show that vitamin D , can , in fact , induce maturation of Mono Mac 6 cells .
Constitutive NF- « B-binding activity was , however , not affected by such treatment ( Figure 4b , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
Primary cells As one source of tissue macrophages , we used cells obtained by pleural lavage .
Constitutive NF- « B in such pleural macrophages was found to be lower ( Figure Sa , lane 2 ) or similar ( lane 4 ) to the level found in the blood monocytes from an unrelated control donor ( lane 1 ) .
Next we tested pairs of primary monocytes and tissue macrophages , obtained from the same donor .
In the example in Figure 5b , paired blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages were isolated from two apparently healthy volun-teers .
Constitutive NF- « B was clearly lower in the alveolar macrophages in both cases .
These results show that among primary cells , the tissue macrophages , compared with blood monocytes , do not show higher levels of constitutive NF- « B in most cases .
Thus in the monocyte lineage , an increase of constitutive NF- « B with maturation is not apparent from these results .

Constitutive TNF gene expression Finally , we asked whether the constitutive NF-KB detectable in nuclei of monocytes might be of functional importance .
For this purpose we studied mRNA levels of TNF , a gene which is transcriptionally controlled by NF- « B .

For cycloheximide ( CHX ) treatment , cells were incubated with 10 g/m } CHX for 2 h. Higher-molecular-mass transcripts were seen in Mone Mac 6 cells for both TNF and GAPDH .
The biological significance of these additional RNAs is unknown .
( ) Nuclear extracts were prepared from Mono Mac 6 cells , left untreated or treated for 90 min with CHX at 10 g/ml or , for comparison , with LPS .
no evidence of constitutive TNF transcripts .
HL60 myelomonocytic stem cells and THP-1 monoblastic cells , both of which express constitutive NF-KB , also exhibit constitutive TNF transcripts .
Furthermore , the monocytic Mono Mac 6 cells also clearly show constitutive TNF mRNA .
Only in the monoblastic U937 cell line , was no TNF mRNA detectable .
In addition , in Mono Mac 6 cells , LPS stimulation substantially increased TNF mRNA prevalence .
Since cytokine transcripts are subject to rapid degradation by protein-synthesis-dependent mechanisms , we asked whether constitutive levels of mRNA might be enhanced by blockade of degradation .
For this purpose , we treated Mono Mac 6 cells with cycloheximide at 10 ug/ml for 90-120 min .
Such treatment did not affect NF- « B-binding activity in nuclear extracts ( Figure 6b ) , but TNF mRNA was enhanced 2.5-fold ( Figure 6b ) .
These results suggest that constitutive NF- « B may , in fact , drive transcription , an effect that is counteracted by rapid degradation of cytokine mRNA .

Figure 7 - Lack of effect of anti-TNF and anti-lL-6 on constitutive NF-xB Mone Mac 6 cells were treated overnight with neutralizing antibodies , and nuclear extracts were isolated after an additional 45 min with or without LPS ( upper panel ) .
Supernatants were recovered 4 h after stimulation with or without LPS and TNF was tested in the Wehi-164S/actinomycin D cytotoxicity assay , and IL-6 was measured in the 7TD1 bioassay ( one of two experiments each ) .
Blockade of autocrine pathways Since cytokines like TNF are capable of inducing a mobilization of NF- « B , one might speculate that constitutive NF- « B is under the control of such autocrine cytokines .
Hence , we have performed blocking studies in order to exclude a role for monocyte-derived cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites .
Treatment of Mono Mac 6 cells overnight with anti-TNF antibody did not affect constitutive or LPS-induced NF- « B ( Figure 7 , upper panel ) , while at the same time the antibody efficiently neutralized LPS-induced TNF activity ( Figure 7 , lower panel ) .
This suggests that the antibody was capable of inactivating TNF protein that might be produced at low but undetectable levels in unstimulated cells .
The same applied to anti-IL-6 antibody , which efficiently neutralized IL-6 activity but had no effect on constitutive or induced NF- « B .
Additional anti-cytokine antibodies that were found not to affect constitutive NF- « B Constitutive nuclear NF-B in cells of the monocyte lineage 93 either were anti- ( IL-1/ $ ) , anti- ( IL-10 ) , anti- ( M-CSF ) and anti- ( GM-CSF ) ( results not shown ) .
In addition , blockade of cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism had no effect .
Hence , although not all monocyte products have been studied , this set of major monocyte-derived cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites can be excluded as inducers of constitutive NF-kB .
DISCUSSION NF- « B is a transcription factor central to a variety of genes involved in immune defence .
The genes regulated by NF- « B can be grouped into ( a ) cytokines , ( b ) receptors and ( c ) acute-phase proteins .
In addition , some viruses , like human immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus , have picked up NF- « B-binding sequences and exploit this transcription factor for their propagation ( Miller et al .
, 1993 ) .
Activation of leucocytes by different types of signals will lead , in the cytoplasm of the cell , to the release of the p50/p65 heterodimer from the inhibitor IxB .
The p50/p65 complex then translocates to the nucleus and binds to regulatory sequences with the consensus sequence GGGRNN-TYCC .
Constitutive binding activity in nuclear extracts of cells without deliberate activation has been noted for B lymphocytes ( Sen and Baltimore , 1986 ) and more recently also for cells of the monocyte system ( Griffin et al .
, 1989 ; Haas et al .
, 1990 ; Kaufman et al .
, 1992 ) .
Monocytes are , however , very sensitive to external signals .
Adbesion , for instance , can trigger gene expression ( Haskill et al .
, 1988 ) , and very low levels of LPS ( in the pg/ml !
range ) may induce expression of genes , like IL-6 ( Taktak et al .
, 1991 ) .
LPS is a frequent contaminant of tissue-culture media , where it can be introduced by medium ingredients , by FCS or by contaminated glassware ( Weinberg , 1981 ) .
Hence , it is possible that a monocyte function considered constitutive is actually induced by unrecognized signals .
Therefore , we have cultured the cells in the absence of serum and we have removed LPS by ultrafiltration .
With this approach , we could show that monocytes do , in fact , mobilize a substantial amount of NF- « B independent of external signals .
It was suggested recently that constitutive NF- « B within the monocyte lineage may increase with increasing stage of differentiation ( Griffin et al .
, 1989 ) .
The cell lines and primary cells studied herein represent different stages of maturation , and it is apparent from our analysis that constitutive NF- « B does not increase with differentiation .
When looking at the different cell lines , there appears to be , however , a trend to higher levels of inducible NF-KB in the more mature cells , which may explain higher levels of 'constitutive ' NF- « B under conditions of inadvertant activation .
This may have been the case in studies by Griffin et al .
( 1989 ) , but it is also possible that these investigators employed different sublines of the original cell lines .
Autocrine mechanisms may be involved in maintaining the constitutive level of NF- « B , since monocyte-derived cytokines like TNF are efficient inducers of this transcription factor ( Miller et al .
, 1993 ) .
By using neutralizing antibodies against this and several other cytokines and by using blockade of arachidonic acid metabolism , we were , however , unable to remove or reduce constitutive NF- « B .
Hence , an autocrine mechanism can be excluded with regard to these major monocytic products .
The question remains what the functional role of such constitutive NF- « B might be : in other studies we have shown that the constitutive NF- « B mainly consists of p50 ( Ziegler-Heitbrock et al .
, 1993 , 1994 ) .
This complex may be related to the nuclear factor KBF1 , which was described to regulate MHC class I expression ( Israel et al .
, 1989 ) .
In fact affinity cross-linking of a similar high-mobility band in uninduced U937 cells demonstrates a p50 and a p55 band within this complex ( Kaufman et al .
, 1992 ) .
As to the functional role of constitutive NF- « B in monocytes , we do see significant cytokine expression in untreated monocytic cells but not in T cells , which express no constitutive NF- « B .
The evidence linking constitutive NF- « B and constitutive TNF is , however , only circumstantial .
To resolve this question , studies with stable reporter gene transfectants are required .
Constitutive TNF transcripts were also reported to occur in various human tissues ( Tovey et al .
, 1988 ) , and one might speculate that tissue macrophages are the source of such cytokine mRNA .
Furthermore , whole blood cultures blocked in transcription by actinomycin D could still be triggered by LPS to release TNF protein ( Hofsli et al .
, 1988 ) , indicating that preformed TNF transcripts were present in these cells .
Our studies in vitro show that blocking of mRNA degradation by cycloheximide enhances TNF transcript levels , while no NF-KB is induced .
Others have reported that cycloheximide does induce NF- « B ( Collart et al .
, 1990 ) .
These contrasting findings may be due to an LPS contamination of cycloheximide or to the use of different cell lines .
However , the enhancement of TNF transcripts in the absence of a cycloheximide effect on constitutive NF- « B in our study argues that cycloheximide may simply prevent the degradation of constitutively transcribed TNF mRNA .
Such an ongoing transcription , probably driven by constitutive NF-KB , may allow monocytes to react extremely rapidly to external stimuli like invading micro-organisms .
