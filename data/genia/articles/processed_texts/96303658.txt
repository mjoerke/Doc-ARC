PROSSNITZ Department of Immunology , The Scripps Research Institute , 10666 N. Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , CA 92037 Receptors for leukocyte chemoattractants , including chemokines , are traditionally considered to be responsible for the activation of special leukocyte functions such as chemotaxis , degranulation , and the release of superoxide anions .
Recently , these G-protein-coupled serpentine receptors have been found to transduce signals leading to gene transcription and translation in leukocytes .
Transcription factors , such as NF « B and AP-1 , are activated upon stimulation of the cells with several chemoattractants at physiologi-cally relevant concentrations .
Activation of transcription factors through these receptors involves G-protein coupling and the activation of protein kinases .
The underlying signaling pathways appear to be different from those utilized by TNF-a , a better characterized cytokine that induces the transcription of immediate-early genes .
Chemoattractants stimulate the expression of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , which in turn may activate their respective receptors and initiate an autocrine regulatory mechanism for persistent cytokine and chemokine gene expression .

, Ph.D. 205 206 that leukocytes encounter at sites of inflammation ( 31 ) , their ability to induce the expression of cytokine genes may be significant with respect to the recruitment of additional leukocytes and the modulation of a local cytokine network .
Monocytes and neutrophils are major sources of proinflammatory cytokines , including chemokines .
Here we present results from our current study of the mechanisms for chemoattractant re-ceptor-mediated gene transcription .
Our data suggest that chemoattractant binding to these receptors leads to activation of NFB and AP-1 , both of which are transcription activators for the expression of immediate-early genes .
The activation process requires functional coupling to G-proteins and appears to utilize signaling pathways different from those employed by several other inducers of NF « B activation , such as TNF- « and PMA .
The activation of transcription leading to the expression of cytokines and chemokines might reflect a fundamental role of chemoattractants .
A more detailed understanding of the signaling mechanisms involved will likely reveal valuable sites for therapeutic intervention .

Filter strips were incubated with primary antibody against the IkxBa carboxyl-terminus ( 1 : 2500 dilution ) for 30 min at room temperature , followed by addition of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:10,000 for 30 min and analysis with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents ( Du Pont-NEN ) .
RESULTS Chemoattractant receptors belong to the super-family of G-protein-coupled receptors with seven putative transmembrane domains ( 19 ) .
Agonist binding of the receptors triggers a series of signaling events leading to specific leukocyte functions ( 30 ) .
To examine whether chemoattractants directly stimulate transcription activation , peripheral blood monocytes were treated with PAF , and the subsequent changes in the levels of the message for heparin binding EGF-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) were measured .
PAF , a lipid chemoattrac-tant , induced an elevation of the HB-EGF message in a dose- and time-dependent fashion ( Fig .
1A ) .
Similarly , PAF stimulated the upregulation of the message for ( Fig .
1B ) .
The expression of the gene was known to be regulated in part by the transcription activator NFkB ( 8 ) , although it was not clear how HB-EGF gene expression was regulated ( 11 ) .
The effect of PAF on NFkB was then examined .

Time course of PAF-induced NFxB ( top panel ) and AP-1 binding activity in CHO-PAFR cells .
The cells were stimulated with 100 nM PAF and nuclear extracts were prepared .
Radiolabeled probes with the « B site and AP-1 site were incubated separately with the nuclear extracts and analyzed by SDS gel .
Note the difference in the time course for the induced « B and AP-1 binding activities , which is consistent with previous reports by others .
nanomolar concentrations PAF activated NFKB to an extent similar to the previously characterized activators TNF- « and PMA .
The time course of these responses suggested that PAF-stimulated NFB may be responsible for the elevated message levels .
This notion was supported by the observation that the inhibitor for NFB , pyrrolidine dithi-ocarbamate ( PDTC ) , dose-dependently blocked PAF-induced NFxB activation as well as elevation of the HB-EGF message levels ( Fig .
3 ) .
A stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing the PAF receptor ( CHO-PAFR cell ) was employed for further characterization of PAF-induced NFkB activation .
The results indicate that PAF stimulation of NFB activation requires the binding of a specific PAF receptor , which can be blocked by two PAF antagonists tested ( not shown ) .
In addition , PAF-induced NFkB activation involves nuclear translocation of p50/p65 , but not c-rel , as shown by UV cross YE ET AL .
linking experiments ( Fig .
4 ) .
Similar to other inducers of NF « B , PAF-induced NFxB activation in CHO cells is preceded by IxB degradation followed by resynthesis ( Fig .
5 ) .
PAF stimulated not only a DNA binding activity but also transcription activation in CHO cells as detected by the expression of a CAT reporter gene ( 6 ) with a « B site from the IxB promoter ( Fig .
6 ) .
These experiments provided detailed information about NFB activation induced by a G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor .
Using gel mobility shift assays with radiolabeled probe containing the AP-1 binding site , it was observed that PAF induced AP-1 activity in the CHO-PAFR cells , although with a different response time compared to that of the activated NFB ( Fig .
7 ) .
Results derived from the above studies prompted us to investigate the capability of other chemoattractants to regulate gene transcription .

Freshly isolated blood mononuclear cells were treated with IL-8 at the indicated concentrations for 1 h before harvesting for the preparation of total RNA and nuclear extracts , as described in Materials and Methods .
tors for a large number of chemoattractants , in addition to the ones used for the study .
As shown in Fig .
8 , mononuclear cells responded to three classical chemoattractants and two chemokines with the formation of DNA-protein complexes detected by gel mobility shift assays using radiolabeled « kB probe .
Further studies with selected chemoattractants produced dose and time response data ( not shown ) similar to those obtained previously with PAF .
These results support the notion that induction of gene transcription may be a general property of chemoattractants .
The two chemokines ( IL-8 and MCP-1 ) tested in the above experiments belong to the CXC and CC chemokine subgroups , respectively .
Biosynthesis of these chemokines can be induced by a number of proinflammatory stimuli , including LPS , IL-1 $ , and TNF-a ( 2 ) .
It has been reported recently that expression of IL-8 and MCP is regulated mainly at the transcription level ( 18 ) .
NF « B sites or similar sequences have been identified in the promoter regions of the genes encoding IL-8 and MCP-1 , and studies using CAT reporter constructs have shown that these sites contribute to the transcription of the IL-8 and MCP-1 genes .
The finding that IL-8 and MCP-1 themselves are capable of inducing NFkB activation suggests a potential autocrine or positive regulatory mechanism for the biosynthesis of these chemokines , as depicted schematically in Fig .
9 .
Indeed , our preliminary results indicate potentiation of the IL-8 message in IL-8-stimulated mononuclear cells ( Fig .
9 , right panel ) .
It has yet to be determined whether this message upregulation is accompanied by IL-8 protein synthesis .
Chemoattractant receptors are G-protein-coupled serpentine receptors and , as such , they may utilize signaling mechanisms different from those employed by other inducers for transcription activation .
PAF treatment of transfected CHO cells induces NFkB activation that requires the functional coupling of the receptor with G-proteins , as cholera toxin effectively blocks this effect of PAF ( Fig .
10 ) .
However , PAF-stimulated responses in mononuclear cells were refractory to cholera toxin treatment .
Instead , pertussis toxin can block PAF-stimulated HB-EGF gene expression ( 23 ) and NFkB activation ( not shown ) .
These observations suggest cell-specific coupling of the PAF receptor to different G-proteins , consistent with previous results from other studies ( 1,28 ) .
212 The potential signaling pathways employed by chemoattractants were compared with those utilized by two other NFkB inducers , TNF-a and PMA .
Treatment of mononuclear cells with the protein kinase inhibitors herbimycin A ( HA ) and staurosporine ( STSP ) blocked PAF-induced NFB activation , while having no effect on TNF- « - and PMA-induced NFB activation ( Fig .
11A ) .
Similarly , two inhibitors for the phosphoinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) , wortmannin and LY294002 , selectively blocked PAF-induced NFkB activation but had no inhibitory effect on the TNF- & « - and PMA-stimulated responses ( Fig .
11B ) .
These findings suggest that PAF regulates NFx « B activity through the activation of G-proteins , protein tyrosine ki-nases , and PI3K .
DISCUSSION A large number of proinflammatory factors are synthesized as a result of leukocyte activation .

YE ET AL .
Understanding the regulatory mechanism for the gene expression process , therefore , is crucial to the development of effective therapeutic agents .
NFkB and AP-1 are major transcription activators that control the expression of a variety of immediate-early genes ( 14,16 ) .
The protein products of some of these genes , including TNF-a and IL-1 , in turn stimulate NFB activation ( 2 ) .
Data from the current study expand the list to include several chemoattractants .
These are agents derived from various sources and are activators of leukocytes during inflammation .
Thus , migrating leukocytes may be exposed to chemoattractants that induce the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines before the cells reach the inflammatory sites .
Previously published data support the notion that chemoattractants stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines ( 5,10 , 13,27,32 ) , but the transcription mechanisms adopted by chemoattractant have not been under-stood .
Chemoattractants may regulate gene transcription with different modes of action .
Apart from the known paracrine and the potential autocrine mechanisms discussed above , juxtacrine stimulation is used by PAF .
Vascular endothelial cells produce cell-associated PAF upon stimulation with inflammatory agents ( 24,35 ) .
By contacting leukocytes through their cell surface proteins such as P-selectin , the endothelial cell-associated PAF may interact with and stimulate the PAF receptor on leukocytes ( 36 ) .
This function of PAF , combined with the capability of PAF to induce transcription activators , is likely to contribute to gene expression essential for the development of several pathological conditions , including atherosclerosis .
PAF stimulates monocytes to express HB-EGF , a potent mitogen for smooth muscle cells , and IL-193 , an inflammatory mediator .
Both proteins are believed to be contributing factors for atherogene-sis ( 20,26 ) .
Chemoattractant receptors constitute a subgroup within the G-protein-coupled receptor su-perfamily ( 19 ) .
Several G-protein-coupled receptors are known to stimulate gene transcription ( 17,25 ) .
With these receptors , the signaling pathways leading to the activation of AP-1 has been partially delineated ( 34 ) .
PAF-induced AP-1 activity is likely to employ a similar mechanism .
With respect to NFB activation , current data support a prototypic model that involves IkB phosphorylation and degradation , followed by nuclear translocation of the p50/p65 heterodimer ( 12,16 ) .

upstream signaling molecules , have not been completely identified .
In this regard , an understanding of the chemoattractant receptor signal transduc-tion pathway may provide complementary information to studies with other receptor systems .
The observed differences between PAF and two other NFkB inducers suggest the existence of alternative mechanisms leading to IxB phosphorylation and degradation .
Future experiments will focus on the identification of upstream signaling molecules utilizing reporter gene constructs and constitutively activated and dominant negative signaling mole-cules .
