BCL-6 Expression During B-Cell Activation By David Allman , Ashish Jain , Alex Dent , Randal R. Maile , Thomas Selvaggi , Marilyn R. Kehry , and Louis M. Staudt Translocations involving the BCL-6 gene are common in the diffuse large cell subtype of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
In-variably , the BCL-6 coding region is intact , but its 5 ' untranslated region is replaced with sequences from the translocation partner .
The present study shows that BCL-6 expression is regulated in lymphocytes during mitogenic stimulation .
Resting B and T lymphocytes contain high levels of BCL-6 mRNA .
Stimulation of mouse B cells with anti-ligM or IgD antibodies , bacterial lipopolysaccharide , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin , or CD40 ligand led to a five-fold to 35-fold decrease in BCL-6 mRNA levels .
Similar downregulation of BCL-6 mRNA was seen in human B cells stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus plus interleukin-2 or anti-ligM antibodies and in human T lymphocytes stimulated HE BCL-6 GENE HAS recently been implicated in the etiology of the subset of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) with a large-cell component .
'* These lymphomas of mature B lymphocytes account for 30 % to 40 % of newly diagnosed NHL cases and as much as 80 % of the NHL mortality . ``
The BCL-6 gene `` ( also designated LAZ3* and is located at chromosome 3q27 , a common site of translocation in NHL .
Rearrangements of the BCL-6 gene have been detected in as many as 45 % of diffuse large-cell lymphomas ( DLCL ) , but they also occur frequently in lymphomas with mixed small and large-cell histology and in follicular lymphomas , particularly those that have transformed into more clinically aggressive tumors .
`` * Likewise , in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) -associated NHL , BCL-6 rearrangements are detectable in 20 % of cases belonging to the DLCL subgroup . ``
One intriguing report suggested that BCL-6 rearrangement defines a biologically distinct subgroup of DLCL that has a more favorable prognosis after chemotherapy , `` `` although this correlation was not apparent in all studies . ``
The BCL-6 protein has six Kriippel-like zinc fingers at its carboxy terminus and thus is presumably involved in transcriptional regulation . ``
In addition , BCL-6 belongs to the newly recognized subfamily of zinc finger transcription factors that share an amino terminal POZ domain . ``
One function of POZ domains is in homodimerization and hetero-dimerization , `` raising the possibility that BCL-6 may act in conjunction with another POZ domain factor .
Despite these structural clues , the normal biologic function of BCL-6 remains to be elucidated .
One consistent feature of the BCL-6 rearrangements in NHL is that the breakpoints cluster in a 5 ' untranslated region of the gene , leaving the BCL-6 coding region intact .
`` ** In this regard , the BCL-6 rearrangements in DLCL are formally analogous to the c-myc rearrangements in Burkitt 's lymphoma .
This observation raised the possibility that deregulation of BCL6 expression is responsible for the malignant transformation in DLCL .
We therefore surmised that an important part of the biology of BCL-6 would be shown by studying the control of its expression in nontransformed lymphocytes .
Indeed , recent immunohistochemistry studies of lymphoid tissues showed that BCL-6 protein was readily detectable in germinal center B cells but not in most other B cells in human Blood , Vol 87 , No 12 ( June 15 ) , 1996 : pp 5257-5268 with phytohemagglutinin .
BCL-6 mRNA levels began to decrease 8 to 16 hours after stimulation , before cells entered S $ phase .
Although polyclonal activation of B cells in vitro invariably decreased BCL-6 mRNA expression , activated B cells from human germinal centers expressed BCL-6 mRNA at levels comparable to the levels in resting B cells .
Despite these similar mRNA levels , BCL-6 protein expression was threefold to 34-fold higher in germinal center B cells than in resting B cells , suggesting that BCL-6 protein levels are controlled by translational or posttranslational mechanisms .
These observations suggest that the germinal center reaction provides unique activation signals to B celis that allow for continued , high-level BCL-6 expression .

lymphoid tissues .
`` * `` `` In the present report , we investigated the regulation of BCL-6 mRNA expression during lymphocyte activation .
We show that naive B lymphocytes activated by a variety of mitogenic stimuli in vitro downregulate BCL6 mRNA , whereas activated B cells from germinal centers continue to express BCL-6 mRNA .
Furthermore , we show that germinal center B cells express dramatically more BCL6 protein than resting B cells , despite similar BCL-6 mRNA levels in the two cell populations .
These findings suggest that the germinal center microenvironment delivers unique activation signals to B lymphocytes that maintain BCL-6 expression .

GAPDH 1 hour before the addition of the indicated stimulus .
Mouse splenic B cells were stimulated with 50 Lg/mL anti-Ig M , 50 pg/mL LPS , 10 ng/mL anti-IgD dextran , or 1 ng/mL PMA plus 1 g/mL ionomycin .
Human B cells and the AKATA B-cell line were stimulated with 50 ug/mL anti-IgM or 1:20,000 wt/vol SAC plus 5 ng/mL rIL-2 , and human T cells were stimulated with 1 pg/mL PHA .
Before RNA isolation , cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and checked for viability by trypan blue exclusion .
DNA content was determined by staining cell aliquots with propidium iodide by standard methods , `` followed by analysis on a Becton Dickinson FACscan with CellQuest software .
CD40 ligand stimulation of B cells .
CD40 ligand was expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus encoding full-length human CD40 ligand ( kindly provided by K. Meek and P. Lipsky* ) .
High-titer virus stocks grown in Sf9 cells or Sf21 cells using standard techniques* were used to infect Sf9 cells grown in suspension cul- 5259 ture for 66 hours at 27°C ( multiplicity of infection [ MOI ] of 20 ) .
Infected Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed twice with ice-cold Rinaldini 's salt solution ( Sigma ) containing 1.0 mmol/ L CaCl1 ; , and membranes were prepared as described .
** `` `` Membranes were washed , resuspended in Dulbecco 's PBS , and titrated in a B-cell proliferation assay .
`` * `` `` The optimal dilution of CD40 ligand-containing membranes was then used to stimulate 3 X 10 `` purified mouse splenic B cells in a 10-mL bulk culture .
Preparation of RNA and Northern blot analysis .
- Total RNA was prepared with the Stratagene RNA isolation kit ( La Jolla , CA ) and poly-A* RNA was isolated by selection on oligo-dT cellulose ( Col-laborative Biomedical Products , Bedford , MA ) .
Poly-A* RNA from human tissues was purchased from Clontech ( Palo Alto , CA ) .
Northern blot analysis was performed using standard methods . ``
'' Mouse RNA blots were hybridized with a 1,200-bp EcoRI fragment derived from the mouse BCL-6 cDNA , stripped , and then rehybridized with a 800-bp Pst I fragment derived from rat GAPDH . ``
Human RNA blots were hybridized with the human BCL-6 PCR fragment described above , stripped , and then rehybridized with a human GAPDH PCR fragment .
Quantitation of Northern blots was achieved on a phosphorimager or densitometer , each equipped with ImageQuant software ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Western blot analysis .
Two different rabbit polyclonal anti-BCL-6 antibodies were used for Western blot analysis .
Antipeptide antisera ( Research Genetics , Huntsville , AL ) were prepared by immunizing rabbits with the peptide C-amino caproic acid-EDEIALH-FEPPNAPLNRK ( derived from BCL-6 amino acids 310 through 327 ) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin .
Affinity-purified anti-BCL-6 antibodies were generated from the antisera using an affinity column prepared from the immunogen .
In some experiments , an anti- antisera generated against BCL-6 amino acids 3 through 484 was used ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
For Western blot analysis , 2.5 x 10° germinal center or human peripheral blood B cells were resuspended in PBS , lysed with the addition of an equal volume of 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol , `` ° boiled for 5 minutes , and briefly sonicated .
Samples were electrophoresed through a 7.5 % SDS-PAGE gel , and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( BA-S NC ; Schleicher & Schuell , Keene , NH ) using a Mini-Transblot apparatus ( Biorad , Hercules , CA ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Blots were incubated with anti-BCL-6 antibodies at 3.3 ug/mL in blocking solution for 1 hour at room ( PBS with 5 % wt/vol nonfat dry milk ) .
Bound antibody was detected either using an ECL kit ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol or by incubating the blot with '*I-labeled donkey antirabbit antibodies ( 1 in blocking solution ; Amersham ) for 30 minutes at room temperature .
The blots were stripped of bound antibody by heating at 50°C for 30 minutes in a buffer consisting of 62.5 mmol/L Tris , pH 7.5 , 100 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol , and 2 % wt/ vol SDS .
To normalize for protein loading , blots were reprobed with anti-Spl antibodies ( 3.3 pg/mL ; antibody PEP 2 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
RESULTS Expression of BCL-6 mRNA in cell lines and tissues .
We initially cloned BCL-6 from a subtracted cDNA library that was enriched in genes expressed in the Raji B-cell line and not in the K562 erythroleukemia cell line . ``
'' Previous studies of the expression of BCL-6 mRNA in human cell lines and tissues have yielded conflicting results , concluding that BCL-6 is preferentially expressed in mature B cells , `` is preferentially expressed in muscle , `` or that BCL-6 expression is ubiquitous . ``

compared the levels of BCL-6 in human cell lines and tissues on the same Northern blot ( Fig 1A ) .
We detected BCL-6 mRNA readily in some , but not all , mature B-cell lines ( Fig 1A , lanes 6 through 11 ) .
BCL-6 was also found to be highly expressed in 3 additional mature B-cell lines and in one of two pre-B-cell lines tested ( data not shown ) .
BCL-6 mRNA levels were low in T-cell , myeloid , and erythroid and HeLa cell lines ( Fig 1A , lanes 1 through 5 , and data not shown ) .
BCL-6 mRNA was detected in all tissues tested , with only minor quantitative differences between tissues ( Fig 1 A , lanes 12 through 17 ) .
Interestingly , the levels of BCL-6 mRNA in certain B-lymphoma cell lines ( Fig 1A , Raji and BJAB ) were not notably higher than tissue levels .
Rather , it appears that the expression of BCL-6 mRNA is downregulated in many cell lines when compared with expression in tissues .
Although BCL-6 is generally expressed at high levels in many Burkitt 's lymphoma B-cell lines ( Fig 1A and B and data not shown ) , it was peculiarly absent from six mature B-cell lines , four of which were long-term B-lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) transformed with EBV ( Fig 1A , MBBI1 and VDSO ; and Fig 1B , LCL-2 and LCL-4 ) .
This observation provided a clue to- possible regulation of BCL-6 during lymphocyte activation because previous studies of LCLs have shown that they have an activated B-cell phenotype . ``
'' `` ' EBV-encoded proteins have been shown to drive expression of cell surface markers that are upregulated after antigenic activation of normal resting B cells , `` `` and thus it was conceivable that BCL-6 would be similarly modulated .
This hypothesis led us to investigate the expression of BCL -6 in the type I Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line , Akata . ``
Akata cells contain EBV in a latent state in which only the EBNA1 gene product is expressed . ``
However , when Akata cells are stimulated by cross-linking of their surface Ig receptors , the EBV lytic cycle is initiated and the cells express several of the EBV gene products that are constituitively expressed in LCLs .
Activation of Akata cells in this fashion led to the downmodulation of BCL-6 mRNA ( Fig 1B ) .

These observations led us to investigate BCL-6 mRNA levels during activation of resting B lymphocytes .
To perform this analysis with mouse as well as human B lymphocytes , we cloned the mouse BCL-6 gene by low stringency hybridization with a human BCL-6 probe .
Sequencing of a 3.5-kb mouse BCL-6 cDNA clone showed striking homology to human BCL-6 ; the predicted amino acid sequences from the cDNAs are 94 % identical ( Fig 2 ) .

This high degree of sequence homology suggests that the mouse and human proteins function analogously and , in particular , share equivalent sequence-specific DNA binding activity .
The mouse BCL-6 cDNA was used to probe a Northern blot of mouse tissue mRNA and , as with human BCL-6 , BCL-6 mRNA was detected at comparable levels in all tissues ( data not shown ) .
To assess BCL-6 expression during B-cell activation , we purified B lymphocytes from mouse spleen and human peripheral blood , because the vast majority of lymphocytes in these sites are in the GO phase of the cell cycle . ``
BCL-6 mRNA was readily detected in unstimulated mouse and human B cells ( Fig 3A , lanes 1 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 12 ) .
In vitro cultures of mouse B cells stimulated with a variety of mitogenic agents ( anti-IgM antibodies , LPS , PMA plus ionomycin , anti-IgD antibodies coupled to dextran , CD40 ligand , or CD40 ligand plus anti-IgM antibodies ) exhibited marked reductions in BCL-6 mRNA levels 24 hours after stimulation 0 0.5 1° 2 4 8 16 Fig 4 .

( Fig 3A ) .
Quantitative analyses of these blots indicated that activation with these stimuli resulted in a 77 % to 97 % reduction in BCL-6 expression ( Fig 3B ) .
A similar reduction in BCL-6 expression was observed after 44 hours of stimulation of human B cells with SAC plus IL-2 or anti-IgM antibodies ( Fig 3A ) .
At this late time point after activation , the B cells should be cycling asynchronously , suggesting that BCL-6 mRNA levels remain reduced in G1 , S , G2 , and M phases of in vitro-activated B cells .
However , we can not rule out the possibility that BCL-6 might be transiently elevated during some phase of the cell cycle in these cultures .
To determine the kinetics of BCL-6 downregulation , we investigated BCL-6 mRNA expression at multiple time points after anti-IgM stimulation of mouse splenic B cells .
BCL-6 expression declined markedly at 8 hours after stimulation and , by 16 hours , was reduced to 2 % to 19 % of the levels in resting lymphocytes ( Fig 4A and B ) .

( C ) DNA synthesis analysis of anti-lgM-stimulated mouse splenic B cells .
B cells were cultured in quadruplicate without or with anti-ligM antibodies at 50 ug/ml for the indicated time peri-ods .
All cultures were pulsed with for the final 4 hours of culture and harvested at the indicated time points .
time points in experiment 1 ( Fig 4B ) was not a consistent finding ( Fig 4B , experiment 2 ) .
To determine the timing of the downregulation of BCL-6 relative to entry into S phase of the cell cycle , parallel cultures were pulsed for 4 hours at multiple time points after anti-Ig M treatment .
DNA synthesis began 20 to 22 hours after stimulation , 12 hours after BCL6 mRNA levels began to decline , and 4 hours after BCL-6 expression was severely reduced ( Fig 4C ) .
Thus , during in vitro mitogenic activation of B cells , BCL-6 expression decreased during the mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle , before entry into S phase .
BCL-6 expression during T-lymphocyte activation .
Because BCL-6 was expressed in human and mouse thymus ( Fig 1A and data not shown ) , we considered the possibility that BCL-6 mRNA levels might be modulated after activation of T lymphocytes .
To test this notion , resting human peripheral blood T cells were polyclonally activated with PHA .
BCL-6 mRNA was detectable in resting T cells and persisted for 4 hours after PHA stimulation ( Fig 5A ) .
However , by 10 to 16 hours of culture with PHA , BCL-6 levels had declined markedly and remained low thereafter , up to and including 47 hours after stimulation .
DNA content analysis indicated that S phase and G2/M phase were reached by 16 and 22 hours , respectively , and by 46 hours , the cells were apparently progressing through the cell cycle asynchronously ( data not shown ) .
These data show that , in T cells , as in B cells , BCL-6 was downregulated after mitogenic activation before entry into S phase .
Expression of BCL-6 mRNA and protein in activated germinal center B cells .
T-cell-dependent activation of B cells leads to the formation of germinal centers . ``
Recent immunohistochemical analyses of human lymphoid tissues using anti-BCL-6 antibodies showed strong and selective 5263 expression of BCL-6 protein in germinal center B cells . ``
To understand the molecular basis of this selective expression , we compared BCL-6 mRNA levels in resting human peripheral blood B cells and activated germinal center B cells from human tonsils .
Surprisingly , both B-cell subsets were found to express BCL-6 mRNA comparably ( Fig 6B and C ) .
Thus , antigen-stimulated B cells that enter the germinal center microenvironment do not downregulate BCL-6 mRNA expression as do B cells activated in vitro .
In contrast , germinal center B cells expressed considerably more BCL-6 protein than did resting B cells , as judged by Western blot analysis ( Fig 6A , B , and C ) .
BCL-6 protein was readily detectable in germinal center cells ( Fig 6A ) and in B-cell lines that express BCL-6 mRNA ( Fig 6A , BJAB and RL ) , but not in B-cell lines that express little or no BCL 6 mRNA ( Fig 6A , VDSO ) .
The level of BCL-6 protein expression in germinal center cells and B-cell lines was roughly equivalent .
The BCL-6 protein from germinal center cells migrated slower in SDS-PAGE gel than BCL-6 protein generated by in vitro translation ( Fig 6A , compare lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Because phosphorylation has been shown to alter the mobility of BCL-6 protein ( Onizuka et al `` and A.D. , unpublished observations ) , this finding suggests that BCL-6 is a phosphoprotein in germinal center B cells .
However , the most interesting finding was that germinal center cells expressed threefold to 34-fold more BCL-6 protein than resting B cells , even though the BCL-6 mRNA levels were similar ( Fig 6B and C ) .
These findings showed that the elevated expression of BCL-6 protein in activated germinal center B cells is not primarily regulated by changes in steady-state mRNA levels .
DISCUSSION We report here that expression of the proto-oncogene BCL-6 is modulated during mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes in vitro .
The highest levels of BCL-6 mRNA were observed in resting B and T lymphocytes .
Stimulation of lymphocytes by diverse mitogenic agents led to profound decreases in BCL-6 expression in mid to late G1 phase .
BCL-6 levels remained low thereafter , even in cultures of asynchronously dividing cells .
By contrast , activated B lymphocytes derived from human germinal centers maintained high BCL-6 mRNA levels .
Taken together , these findings suggest that the regulation of BCL-6 mRNA expression during lymphocyte activation depends critically on the nature of the activation signal .
Furthermore , we have presented evidence that BCL-6 protein expression is regulated independently of mRNA expression to achieve selective and high-level expression of BCL-6 protein in germinal center B cells .
The first indication that BCL-6 expression might be regulated in B lymphocytes came from the observation that EBV-transformed LCL s did not express BCL-6 , whereas Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines had high levels of BCL-6 mRNA .
Indeed , three other independently isolated LCLs have been shown to lack BCL-6 mRNA . ``
LCL s differ from Burkitt 's lymphoma lines in that LCLs express a set of EBV gene products that have been shown to transcriptionally activate a variety of cellular genes ( for review see Klein `` ) .
In particular , LCLs express the EBV membrane protein LMP1 that From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

has been shown to induce the expression of a variety of membrane proteins that are normally found only on activated B lymphocytes . ``
LMPI has been shown to activate NF-kB , `` `` `` `` possibly by virtue of its association with a member of the TRAF protein family . ``
'' Transactivation of cellular genes in LCLs is mediated additionally by the EBNA2 protein that activates cellular promoters indirectly via a protein-protein interaction with the J , signal recognition protein .
`` * `` `` Additional evidence of regulated expression of BCL-6 came from the observation that anti-Ig treatment of Akata Burkitt 's lymphoma cells caused BCL-6 mRNA levels to decrease .
Akata cells triggered with anti-Ig antibodies activate the latent EBV genome and partially resemble LCLs in that they begin to express the latent membrane protein gene products , LMP1 , LMP2A , and LMP2B . ``
However , activated Akata cells differ from LCLs in that they do not express EBNA2 and do express the several EBV gene products that initiate a lytic viral cycle . ``
Thus , it is not clear at present whether the downregulation of BCL-6 in LCLs and Akata cells proceeds by the same or distinct pathways .
It will therefore be interesting to delineate which EBV gene products modulate BCL-6 expression as this may shed light on the signaling pathways that converge on the BCL-6 gene .
The stimuli that downregulated BCL-6 in lymphocytes act through distinct signaling pathways but were all mitogenic .
B lymphocytes stimulated with anti-IgM , anti-IgD , PMA plus ionomycin , LPS , CD40 ligand , or SAC plus IL-2 had decreased BCL-6 levels , as did T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA .
Signals induced in B cells by treatment with anti-IgM or LPS are mechanistically distinct in that anti-IgM triggering engages tyrosine kinases that are inhibited by her-bimycin , whereas LPS signaling is not affected by this drug .
* ' Nevertheless , anti-Ig and LPS-derived signals converge on common pathways such as activation of NF-kB . ``

**** Interestingly , both CD40 and LMP1 interact with a newly described member of the TRAF family of putative signal transduction proteins .
`` `` * `` ** Because LMPI is expressed in LCLs , it is conceivable that this protein may play a role in downregulating BCL-6 in LCLs as well as in CD40 ligand-stimulated cells .
Finally , it is important to note that all of the signals that caused downmodulation of BCL-6 mRNA in vitro were mitogenic .
The downmodulation of BCL-6 occurred 8 to 16 hours after 5265 Fig 6 .

Therefore , our working model is that BCL-6 regulation is a secondary effect of in vitro mitogenic signaling that is mediated indirectly by one or more of the immediate early transcription factors .
However , a striking dichotomy in our studies is that , although in vitro-activated B cells have low BCL-6 mRNA expression , activated B cells from human germinal centers expressed BCL-6 mRNA to the same degree as resting B lymphocytes .

Activation of B cells in germinal centers results from the interplay of three cell types : antigen-specific B cells , antigen-specific T cells , and follicular dendritic cells .
Activated T cells display CD40 ligand on their cell surface and stimulate B cells through CD40 .
Indeed , ongoing CD40 signaling is necessary to maintain the germinal center response . ``
Interactions between B and T cells in the germinal center also include binding of B7-2 on the B-cell surface to CD28/CTLA-4 on T cells , and this signaling event is important for the generation of B-cell memory and somatic hypermutation of Ig genes . ``
Antigen present as immune complexes on the surface of follicular dendritic cells may signal B cells through their cell surface receptor . ``
Finally , it has been shown that soluble antigen can signal germinal center B cells through the cell surface Ig receptor to undergo apoptosis . ``

germinal centers is multifactorial and not readily mimicked within in vitro cultures .
Indeed , B cells stimulated in vitro through CD40 along with interleukin-4 are able to switch Ig isotype but do not allow somatic hypermutation of Ig genes . ``
In light of the complex nature of the germinal center micro-environment , it is less surprising that BCL-6 mRNA expression differed between B cells activated in vitro and B cells activated in germinal centers .
Clearly , our in vitro culture conditions must lack critical coordinate signals that are present within the germinal center and serve to maintain BCL6 mRNA expression during B-cell activation .
Quantitative analysis of BCL-6 protein levels revealed that purified human germinal center B cells expressed considerably more protein than resting human B cells purified from peripheral blood .
This finding is in keeping with recent immunohistochemical studies of human lymphoid tissues that showed that BCL-6 protein was readily detectable in germinal center B cells but not in most resting B cells in the From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

BCL-6 EXPRESSION DURING B-CELL ACTIVATION mantle and marginal zones . ``
However , an unanticipated finding was that the higher BCL-6 protein levels in germinal center cells could not be fully accounted for by increased mRNA expression .
Thus , in some preparations of resting and germinal center B cells , BCL-6 protein levels were threefold to 34-fold higher in the germinal center B cells despite roughly comparable BCL-6 mRNA levels in the two cell populations .
These data raise the possibility that regulation of mRNA levels may not be the only mechanism by which BCL-6 protein expression is upregulated in germinal center B cells .
mRNA translation is regulated in many genes and can be mediated by binding of proteins to cis-acting RNA motifs in the untranslated regions of mRNAs . ``
In this regard , it is interesting that the untranslated regions of human and mouse BCL-6 mRNA have stretches of high sequence conservation ( data not shown ) .
Posttranslational protein modifications can affect steady-state protein levels by altering protein stability .
It is therefore noteworthy that BCL-6 is a phosphoprotein , `` because protein phosphoylation has been shown to alter the rate of degradation of some pro-teins .
`` * `` `` Future analysis of BCL-6 mutants should show whether translational and posttranslational mechanisms govern the regulation of BCL-6 protein expression .
In summary , two modes of regulation are used to ensure high-level BCL-6 protein expression in germinal centers .
First , in contrast to many modes of B cell activation in vitro , B-cell activation in germinal centers does not lead to the downmodulation of BCL-6 mRNA expression .
Second , our data suggest that BCL-6 protein levels may be regulated independently of BCL-6 mRNA levels , resulting in higher BCL-6 protein levels in germinal center B cells than in resting B cells .
Such complex regulation of BCL-6 expression during B-cell activation is consistent with a postulated im- portant and selective function of BCL-6 during the germinal center reaction .
