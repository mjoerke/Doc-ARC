To understand the mechanisms underlined in this regulation in normal human cells , we have analysed in vivo protein-DNA interactions at the Cyclin A locus in primary T lymphocytes .
Stimulation of purified T lymphocytes by a combination of monoclonal antibodies directed at CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules gives rise to a long lasting proliferation in the absence of accessory cells .
Cyclin A was observed after 4 days of costimulation with anti CD2 + CD28 whereas stimulation by anti CD2 or anti CD28 alone was not effective .
In vivo genomic DMS footprinting revealed upstream of the major transcription initiation sites , the presence of at least three protein binding sites , two of which were constitutively occupied .
They bind in vitro respectively ATF-1 and NF-Y proteins .
The third site was occupied in quiescent cells or in cells stimulated by anti CD2 or anti CD28 alone .
The mitogenic combination of anti CD2 + anti CD28 released the footprint as cells were committed to proliferation .
Consistent with theses results , nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent cells formed a specific complex with this element , whereas extracts prepared from cells treated with anti CD2 + anti CD28 failed to do so after cells entered a proliferative state .
Keywords : cyclin A ; primary T lymphocytes adhesion Introduction The mechanisms leading to transcriptional modulation of proliferation associated genes involved in the control of the transition between the G , and the S phases of the cell division cycle are not well understood in primary cells .
Only few informations have been gathered about cell cycle specific binding of transcription factors in vivo .
We have undertaken a thorough analysis of the in vivo structure of the promoter-proximal region of cyclin A gene through the use of high resolution genomic footprinting .
It is now currently proposed that cell progression through the different phases of the cell division cycle is controlled by a family of cyclin-dependent protein kinases ( cdk ) .
Several types of cyclins have been identified in higher eukaryotes and cyclin A is synthesized at the onset of DNA replication as well as during the G , /M transition .
By binding to respectively Correspondence : JM Blanchard Received 7 November 1996 ; revised 14 February 1997 ; accepted 17 February 1997 the cdk2 and cdc2 ( ecdk1 ) kinases , the A-type cyclin has been implicated in the control of both the dependence of mitosis on S-phase completion , as well as that of mitosis ( Swenson et al .
, 1986 ; Lehner and O'Farrell , 1989 , 1990 ; Pines and Hunter , 1990a ; Tsai et al .
, 1991 , Walker and Maller , 1991 ) .
Cyclin A is found in cellular activities which promote both replication ( Cardoso et al .
, 1993 ; D'Urso et al .
, 1990 ; Pagano et al .
, 19922 ; Pines and Hunter , 1990b ; Resnitzky et al .
, 1995 ; Sobczak-Thepot et al .
, 1993 ) , and transcription ( for reviews see : LaThangue , 1994 ; Nevins , 1992 ; Weinberg , 1995 ) .
In the former case , it has been shown associated with replication complexes and is likely to directly participate in the phosphorylation of some of the replication factors ( Dutta & Stillman , 1992 ; Xiong et al .
, 1993 ) .
In the latter case , its association with the E2F/DRTFI family of transcription factors has been proposed to play a central role in cell cycle transcriptional control ( LaThangue , 1994 ) .
A large body of evidence suggests that cyclin-dependent kinases participate in the regulation of the activity of this transcription complex .
This is believed to occur either directly , by the phosphorylation of E2F by cyclin A-cdk2 kinase , or indirectly through the phosphorylation of a group of proteins structurally related to RB , the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product , by cyclins D , E , A associated with edk4 , edk6 or cedk2 kinases .
Consistent with these ideas , cyclin A is found complexed with E2F in late G , and during S phases , recruiting the catalytic kinase subunit to the DNA-binding complex ( Cao et al .
, 1992 ; Devoto et al .
, 1992 ; Helin and Harlow , 1993 ; Li et al .
, 1993 ; Pagano et al .
, 1992b ; Shirodkar et al .
, 1992 ; Xu et al .
, 1994 ) .
In contrast to the expanding wealth of information about the regulation of the expression of molecules involved in cell cycle control in established cell lines , only few studies have been devoted to normal human primary cells .
Primary T cell culture offers a good opportunity to study the transition from a quiescent to a proliferative state upon peripheral stimulation .
These cells , which are normally in a G , state , can be quantitatively committed to proliferation when receiving an appropriate combination of mitogenic stimuli such as CD28-specific monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) in association with either CD2 or CD3 mAbs .
Under such circumstances , several of the physiological aspects of T lymphocyte activation are mimicked .
CD2 + CD28 costimulation induces a strong activation of both IL-2Ra gene transcription and mRNA stabilization , which results in the high level of expression of the receptor at the cell surface .
This is followed by a wave of cell divisions after a 3-4 days time lag , responsible for a long lasting ( 3-4 weeks ) and monocyte-independent T Cyclin A expression in human primary T lymphocytes A Plet et al 2576 cell proliferation .
This is associated with the prolonged secretion of cytokines , either T-specific , such as IL-2 and IFN-y , or normally synthesized by accessory cells , such as IL-1 @ , TNF- « and CSF-1 ( Olive et al .
, 1994 ) .
It had previously been shown that cyclin A gene was transcriptionally activated by mitogenic signals and the major promoter-proximal elements characterized by transient transfection experiments into transformed or immortalized cell lines ( Barlat et al .
, 1993 ; Henglein et al .
, 1994 ; Schulze et al .
, 1995 ; Zwicker et al .
, 1995 ; Huet et al .
, 1996 ) .
Using dimethylsulphate ( DMS ) genomic footprinting we show here that , like for the established cell lines examined so far , at least three putative protein binding sites are occupied in vivo .
Two of them , which bind in vitro proteins of the CREB/ ATF and NF-Y families , are constitutively occupied in vivo .
The third site , proposed to be involved in the down regulation of the promoter in quiescent cells , is occupied in quiescent but not in CD2+CD28 costimulated proliferating cells .
Stimulations by either CD2 or CD28 mAbs alone , conditions known to be insufficient to give rise to a mitogenic signal , did not result in a relief of the footprint .
Results Cyclin A expression in primary human T lymphocytes When purified T lymphocytes were stimulated with a combination of anti CD2 + anti CD28 mAbs , incorporation of radioactive thymidine was observed after a 1 day time lag and increased rapidly to reach a maximum around 8-10 days of costimulation ( Figure la ) .
This resulted in a more than 10-fold increase in cell number ( Figure 1c ) which was spread on a 3-4 week period .
In contrast , stimulation by anti CD2 or anti CD28 mAb alone did not give rise to a measurable level of thymidine incorporation ( Figure 1b ) , nor to an increase in cell number .
Similarly , CD2+CD28 costimulation activated the secretion of IL-2 which peaked around 4 days , as well as the expression of IL-2Ra chain of the receptor at the cell surface , which lasted for at least 3 weeks , with more than 80 % of the cells scoring positive ( data not shown , Costello et al .
, 1993 ) .
Medium alone , single anti CD2 or anti CD28 stimulations , were ineffective in inducing a detectable level of secreted IL-2 , neither an increase of IL-2R « chain at the cell surface ( data not shown ) .
Cyclin A expression was monitored by a Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from either quiescent or stimulated T lymphocytes .
In a way parallel to that of radioactive thymidine incorporation , the protein began to be detectable after 2 days of CD2+CD28 costimulation , was clearly visible at 4 days , and its accumulation was maximum between 12 and 14 days ( Figure 1d ) .
Again , medium alone , anti CD2 or anti CD28 single stimulations were ineffective in inducing cyclin A .
A motif required for the repression of cyclin A promoter in quiescent fibroblasts is active in a T cell context It has previously been shown that cyclin A expression during the G1/S transition results from a transcriptional activation of its gene ( Barlat et al .

Comparison of both the human and mouse cyclin A promoters has revealed the presence of a stretch of conserved nucleotides within which several putative protein binding sites have been underlined .
Several recent reports , based on transient transfection experiments carried out in immortalized or transformed cell lines have stressed the importance of a cyclic AMP responsive element ( CRE ) in mediating cyclin A gene responses to both cAMP , TGF- $ or contact inhibition in human Hs27 ( Desdouets et al .
, 1995 ) , hamster CCL39 fibroblasts ( Barlat et al .
, 1995 ) , as well as in bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAEC ) ( Yoshizumi et al .
, 1995 ) .
Interestingly , another GC-rich element , named the 'cell cycle responsive element ' ( CCRE ) has also been demonstrated to be instrumental in the response of cyclin A promoter to serum stimulation in quiescent fibroblasts ( Huet et al .
, 1996 ) .
Mutation of this site rendered the cyclin A promoter constitutive and cell cycle-irresponsive .
In order to confirm this observation in T lymphocytes , we resorted to the use of a human T cell line ( Kit225 ) which recapitulates some of the properties of normal T lymphocytes , but which are more amenable to transfection experiments .
Purified , quiescent primary T lymphocytes turned out to be , at least in our hands , very difficult to transfect , and only strong promoters such as the human cytomegalovirus early promoter gave reproducible results .
Kit225 cells are absolutely dependent upon the presence of IL-2 for their proliferation .
This is illustrated in Figure 2a where cells grown in serum alone ( upper panel ) or serum + IL-2 ( lower panel ) have been sorted according to their DNA content .
In the absence of the cytokine almost 80 % of the cells were found in the G , phase of the cell cycle , with only few cells entering S phase ( 6.4 % ) .
IL-2 treatment gave rise to a five- to sixfold increase in cells in the S phase ( 35.8 % ) together with a twofold increase in cells in the G2/M phase ( 28.7 % ) .
Kit225 cells were transfected with a luciferase expression vector containing a DNA fragment spanning nucleotides -177 to +100 relative to the 3 most initiation site ( Barlat et al .
, 1995 ; Huet et al .
, 1996 ) .
Stimulation of quiescent cells by IL-2 gave rise to a four- to fivefold stimulation of the wild type vector ( pGL2-cycA ) , a figure commensurate with the increase in S phase cells , whereas mutation of the CCRE ( pGL2-cycAm ) abolished this effect ( Figure 2b ) .
Moreover , most of this effect was accounted for by a relief of the inhibition observed in the absence of IL-2 .
An in vivo footprint is present on a motif involved in cell cycle control of cyclin A promoter only in quiescent T lymphocytes To analyse in more details the mechanism governing the inducibility of cyclin A gene transcription , we performed an in vivo footprint analysis of the region containing the conserved upstream promoter sequence .
Quiescent primary T lymphocytes were either stimulated with anti CD2 , anti CD28 or a combination of both mAbs .
At each indicated time of treatment , cells were exposed to dimethylsulphate ( DMS ) and genomic DNA was processed for the detection of hypomethy-lated guanine residues as described ( Garrity and Wold , 1992 ; Barlat et al .
, 1995 ) .
In cells either quiescent or stimulated for a 24 h period ( Figure 3a , left panel ) with any combination of mAbs , a clear protection was visible on both the CRE and the GC-rich ( CCRE ) motifs together with a weaker but significant protection of a NF-Y site ( Figure 3a ) .
As a control that lymphocytes have already evolved towards prolifera-tion , changes in proteins binding to the NF- « B site present in the promoter of the early gene coding for IL-2Ra « was examined on the same DNA preparations ( Figure 4 ) .
A clear protection was observed as soon as 6 h post costimulation which corresponded to nuclear translocation of NF-xB as detected by gel shift experiments ( data not shown ) ( Algarte et al .
, 1995 ) .
However , whereas the CRE and the NF-Y sites were protected whatever the time point , or the mAbs combination selected to stimulate T lymphocytes , the CCRE motif became exposed only when cells were costimulated with a mitogenic combination of CD2+ CD28 mAbs at times when proliferation began to take place ( 96 h ) .
The same site remained protected Cyclin A expression in human primary T lymphocytes A Plet et al in quiescent cells or in cells stimulated with anti CD2 or anti CD28 mAb alone ( Figure 3a , right panel , last lane ) .
This is illustrated in a more quantitative way in Figure 3b .

( a ) Primary T cells were cultured in medium alone ( unstimulated ) , stimulated with only one monoclonal antibody ( CD2 , CD28 ) or stimulated with the mitogenic combination of both of them ( CD2 + CD28 ) .
Cells were treated with DMS after 1 ( left panel ) or 4 days ( right panel ) of treatment , and their DNA was prepared for in vivo footprinting as described .
Genomic footprinting was run with the control DMS/piperidin-treated naked DNA ( in vitro ) prepared from T lymphocytes of the same donor .
Arrows , protected G residues .
Note that there is each DMS-sensitive bands of the CCRE and the CRE have been plotted after normalization relative to a set of invariant bands .
Only the mitogenic combination of mAbs ( CD2+ CD28 ) gave rise to a complete relief of the footprint present on the CCRE , whereas anti CD2 alone was inefficient .
The invariant footprint on the CRE is provided as an internal control .
Proteins binding in vitro to the CCRE of cyclin A promoter are present only in nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent T lymphocytes Nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent T lymphocytes were reached with a series of probes spanning nucleotides -74 to +34 relative to the 3 most transcription initiation site , and containing individual mutations of respectively , the CRE , the NF-Y and the CCRE .
Three major retarded complexes were clearly visible ( Figure Sa ) .
Mutation of the CRE abolished the formation of the fast migrating compex 1 , and decreased as well as the intensity of the slower migrating complex 3 .
Mutation of the NF-Y site decreased by a factor of three the intensity of band 2 , probably allowing the detection of another band migrating at the same position as band 2 .
A slight reinforcement of both bands 1 and 3 was also observed .

Arrows , protected G residues ; asterisks , hypersensitive sites Cyclin A expression in human primary T lymphocytes A Plet et al lead to an apparent variation in band intensity .
This last result could be interpreted by the masking of the complex formed on the CCRE by that formed with the NF-Y site , the two complexes having identical mobilities .
The latter possibility was suggested in some experiments where the resolution was high enough to visualize two closely migrating bands ( data not shown ) .
We then used these probes with extracts prepared from T lymphocytes stimulated by various combinations of mAbs .

Closed bars : CCRE ; Open bars ; CRE 2579 Cyclin A expression in human primary T lymphocytes A Plet et al 2580 progressive loss of bands 1 and 3 , whereas band 2 persisted , suggesting the constitutive binding of some of these factors ( Figure 5b ) .
Interestingly , when the probe mutated on the NF-Y site was used , a progressive loss of all three bands was observed with the transient appearance of a fourth type of complex between bands 2 and 3 .
These observations could tentatively be explained by an anchoring role for NF-Y , which could stabilize the binding of factors to the other sites nearby .
Because of the complexity of the patterns obtained with the large probes , we next switched to oligonucleotides containing individual sites ( Figure 6 ) .
The NF-Y oligonucleotide showed a prominent , slowly migrating complex , together with a set of fast migrating bands .
The former corresponded to a constitutive and specific binding of factor ( s ) whatever the origin of the extract and was therefore used as an internal standard of gel loading .
The faster migrating bands were not considered as specific as they were equally competed by both a wild type ( Figure 6 ) and a mutated ( data not shown ) NF-Y oligonucleotides .
An antibody directed at the B subunit of NF-Y displaced quantitatively the retarded band into a slower migrating complex .

For each probe , a competition assay was performed with 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled corresponding oligonucleotide ( competitor ) added in the reaction mixture .
wt and mut refer respectively to the wild type and mutated version of the oligonucleotide .
When indicated , extracts were incubated with antibodies directed respectively against the Yb subunit of NF-Y ( « Yb ) , the CREB/ATF family , ATF-1 , CREB or CREM , 1 h prior to the addition of the probe similar supershift was introduced by an antibody directed at the A subunit of the same factor ( data not shown ) , thus identifying this sequence as an in vitro high affinity site for NF-Y .
Similarly , analysis on proteins binding to the CRE probe revealed an invariant binding whether extracts were prepared from quiescent or stimulated cells .
We thus show in Figure 6 only results obtained with extracts from quiescent cells .
The more prominent specific retarded complexes were supershifted as expected by broad specificity antibodies reacting with all members of the CREB/ATF families .
When monoclonal antibodies directed at specific members of these families were used , only anti-ATF-1 gave rise to a strong supershift .
A specific complex was also formed with the CCRE probe and extracts from quiescent as well as for 24 h stimulated cells .
However , extracts from cells stimulated for longer times failed to form stable complexes in vitro .
As the CCRE core sequence is GC-rich , we tried competitions with unlabelled nucleotides corresponding respectively to SP1 and E2F consensus sites without any success .
At the moment , the factor ( s ) binding to the cyclin A CCRE is still unknown and its characterization will await further work .
Discussion Numerous studies conducted in immortalized or transformed cell lines have shown that cyclin A mRNA accumulation is cell cycle regulated by a transcriptional activation of its gene in the late G ; phase of the cell division cycle ( Barlat et al .
, 1992 ; Henglein et al .
, 1994 ; Schulze et al .
, 1995 ; Zwicker et al .
, 1995 ; Huet et al .
, 1996 ) .
We have therefore undertaken the analysis of sequences and factors involved in the control of the expression of this gene under conditions close to physiological ones .
To this aim , we have analysed the in vivo chromatin structure at the cyclin A locus in primary T human lymphocytes .
Comparison of the sequences of the human and mouse promoters had revealed the presence of a region of striking homology containing a cAMP responsive element ( CRE ) , a NF-Y binding site , and a GC-rich motif ( Zwicker et al .
, 1995 ; Schulze et al .
, 1995 ; Huet et al .
, 1996 ) .
Our previous work on cyclin A down regulation of TGF-B had pointed to the CRE as an important mediator of the inhibitory effect of the cytokine ( Barlat et al .
, 1993 , 1995 ) .
However , a promoter , mutated on the CRE , was still able to respond to serum stimulation albeit at a lower efficiency .
DMS footprinting of proteins binding in vivo to this locus in T lymphocytes stimulated with appropriate combinations of mAbs directed at cell surface molecules , revealed the presence of several protected regions near the major transcription initiation sites .
Whereas the CRE and the NF-Y sites were occupied whichever combination of mAbs selected , the occupancy of the GC-rich site was specifically observed in quiescent cells or in cells stimulated with non-mitogenic mAbs .
Conversely , when lymphocytes were exposed to a mitogenic anti CD2 costimulation , the footprint present on the CCRE was released at late times of stimulation when cells had entered a proliferative programme .
Occupancy of the CCRE was thus observed only when cyclin A gene was transcriptionally silent .
This suggested the possibility of the binding of a transcriptional inhibitor to this region .
This prompted us to look for proteins binding to a CCRE probe in vitro in a standard gel shift assay .
A specific binding was observed with extracts prepared from quiescent cells and not from cells stimulated with anti CD2+ CD28 at times where cells were actively growing .
As a control , the NF-Y probe showed a constitutive binding .
A recent report ( Zwicker et al .
, 1996 ) evidenced the cell cycle regulation of the B-myb E2F site occupation in vivo in serum-stimulated NIH3T3 cells .
Despite the weak similitudes between the human cyclin A CCRE and the murine B-myb E2F sites ( respectively GTCGCGGG and CTTGGCGG ) , both sites present a loss of protection in vivo that coincided with the onset of transcription of the respective genes .
Based upon similar patterns of in vitro and in vivo methylated guanine protection , the authors proposed that the protein complex interacting in vivo was indeed E2F .
However , no electromobility-shift assays performed in parallel with nuclear extract from cell-cycle synchronized NIH3T3 cells were presented .
Our data do not allow us to conclude whether the CCRE repressor is one of the known E2F complexes .
Further experiments are required to elucidate whether the factors at play in the two experimental models are either identical or only similar in their consequence of in vivo occupancy .
While this work was completed , two reports ( Schulze et al .
, 1995 ; Zwicker et al .
, 1995 ) pointed to the CCRE as an important element in controlling the cell cycle behaviour of human cyclin A promoter , but diverged on the nature of the protein ( s ) binding in vitro to this sequence .
The former group ( Schulze et al .
, 1995 ) proposed that members of the E2F/DP family together with pockets proteins were binding to the CCRE , whereas the latter group ( Zwicker et al .
, 1995 ) did not succeed in characterizing proteins interacting with this sequence , and even alluded to the fact that recombinant E2F-1 was not binding in vitro to the CCRE .
In a previous work ( Huet et al .
, 1996 ) , we had shown that mutation of the GC-rich sequence led to a 10-fold increase in the reporter activity and almost totally impaired its cell cycle-dependent activation , when assayed by transient transfection , thus confirming its negative regulatory role .
Interestingly , the CCRE sequence was not sufficient to endow an enhancer-less promoter with a cell cycle-responsiveness .
This result thus suggests a cooperation between the CCRE and other sequences , either promoter-proximal such as the CRE or the NF-Y , or more distal and which remain to be defined .
The presence of a constitutive in vivo footprint on both the CRE and the NF-Y sites nearby points to their possible involvement in modulating the CCRE activity .
The apparent discrepancy between the constitutive occupancy of the CRE and the absence of complex in gel shift performed with the mutated large probe and extracts from mitogenically stimulated cells , again points to a cooperation between the binding sites in this region .
They are several possible mechanisms , which are not mutually exclusive .
First of all , the structure of the entire region , such as its curvature , could be modified by the binding of the different factors .
An effect visible only with large probes spanning the entire region .
The same factors could also transiently attract an auxiliary protein not Cyclin A expression in human primary T lymphocytes A Plet et al necessarily directly contacting DNA , which could explain the transient appearance of band 4 .
Finally , we propose that the NF-Y factor could organize the binding of the nearby factors .
Such a situation is not unprecedented and previous report have pointed to the possibility that NF-Y might facilitate in vivo recruitment of upstream DNA binding transcription factors ( Wright et al .
, 1994 ; Coustry et al .
, 1995 ) .
The resolution of this problem will await the purification of the factor binding to the CCRE and the establisment of an in vitro assay to study these multiple interactions .
Materials and methods Cell culture and transfection Peripheral lymphocytes were isolated from voluntary , healthy donors and purified as described ( Cerdan et a/ .
, 1991 ) .
Purity of T cell preparations ( > 99 % ) was checked by immunofluorescence labelling with various mAbs specific respectively for monocytes , B and NK cells .
Contamination by monocytes was also checked by the absence of proliferation upon optimal stimulation with PHA .
Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , and activated with the indicated antibodies .
Kit225 , an interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -dependent human T cell line ( Hori et al .
, 1987 ) , was maintained in RPMI 1650 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 nM recombinant IL-2 ( Eurocetus ) .
Cells were growth-arrested by culturing them for 48 h in IL-2-free medium .
When needed , cells were sorted according to their DNA content with a FACScan ( Becton Dickinson ) after labelling with propidium iodide as described ( Huet et al .
, 1996 ) .
After a 24 h period of growth in low IL-2 ( 50 U/ml ) , 2 x 10° cells were washed three times with PBS , concentration to 10° cells/ml in serum and IL-2-free medium , and transfected by exposition for 5 h to 2 ug DNA and 8 ug DMIERC ( GIBCO ) .
Fifteen percent fetal calf serum was then added , and cells grown in the absence of IL-2 for an additional 48 h. Luciferase activity was monitored 24 h later , after addition of IL-2 to a final concentration of 360 U/ml .
In vivo genomic footprint analysis 10 ' cells were concentrated in 1 ml of RPMI containing 10 % FCS and 20 mm HEPES ( pH 7.3 ) , then exposed for 1 min to 5 ul/ml dimethylsuiphate and the reaction quenched with 2 % - B-mercaptocethanol , followed by washing in cold PBS .
After extraction of genomic DNA and Piperidine cleavage of methylated Guanines , methyla-tion interference was monitored using a ligation mediated PCR ( LM-PCR ) as described ( Garrity and Wold , 1992 ; Barlat et al .
, 1995 ) .
The following oligonucleotides were used : for the cyclin A locus : -GCGGGAGGAGCGTAGAGCCC -AGCCCAGGAGCCGCGAGCTG -CAGGAGCCGCGAGCTGCGCG for the IL-2Ra locus : -TGACTCCTGAGGACGTTA -GGGGAGGACTCAGCTTATGAAGTGC -CAGCTTATGAAGTGCTGGGTGAGACCACT The last oligonucleotides of each set were labelled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ y `` PJATP , and radioactive , elongated DNA was fractionated on a 6 % polyacrylamide sequencing gel .

For each individual site , the following double stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to respectively , the cyclin A CRE , the NF-Y and the CCRE sites were used : CRE : NF-Y : 5'-GAGCGCTTTCATTGGTCCATTT CCRE : 5'-GGGATTTCAATAGTCGCGGGCTACTTGAA When indicated , the following mutated oligonucleotides were also used : mCRE : 5'-GGGTCGCCTTCAACGACCTCGAGGCCGCGA mNF-Y : 5'-GAGCGCTTGAATTCGTCCATTT mCCRE : 5'-GGGATTTCAATAGTCGAATTCTACTTGAA The annealed oligonucleotides described above , were either end-labelled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ yPJATP ( 3000 Ci/mmole , Amersham ) , or labelled by filling in of the recessive ends with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [ « `` P ] JdCTP ( 3000 Ci/mmole , Amersham ) .
For nuclear extracts , T cells were washed in cold Tris-buffered saline then resuspended in 0.4 ml of 10 mm HEPES ( pH 7.8 ) , 10 mm KCl , 2 mm MgCl , , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 0.1 mm EDTA , 0.1 mM phenylmethylsuiphonyl fluoride , 0.3 mg/ml leupeptine , for 15 min on ice .
Twenty-five ul of 10 % Nonidet-P40 was then added , and after a 15 s vigorous agitation , cells were spun for 15s at 13 000 r.p.m .
( Sorval minicentrifuge ) .
Nuclei were resuspended in 50 ul 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7.8 ) , 50 mM KCI , 300 mm NaCl , 0.1 mm EDTA , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride , 10 % ( v/v ) glycerol for 20 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 13 000 r.p.m .
The cleared supernatants were stored at -80°C after estimation of the protein concentration according to Bradford ( Bio-Rad ) .
Two ug of nuclear extracts were used in the presence of either 1 ug poly ( dI-dC ) ( CRE and NF-Y ) of dA-dT ( CCRE ) and radioactive probe ( 0.1-1 ng ) in 20 ul of the same buffer .
Complexes were resolved in a 5 % polyacrylamide ( acrylamide : bisacrylamide , 29:1 ) gel run in 0.25 x TBE at 4°C .
Proliferation assay Purified T lymphocytes were grown in a 96-well microtiter plate ( 20 000 cells/well ) in a final volume of 200 ul RPMI References Algarte M , Lecine P , Costello R , Plet A , Olive D and Imbert J .

All assays were performed in triplicate .
Antibodies The following antibodies were used for T lymphocyte stimulation : mAb 39C1.5 and 6F10.3 ( anti CD2 ) , or mAb 248 ( anti CD28 ) .
CD2 mAb was used purified at a concentration of 10 ug/ml and CD28 mAb as a 1/400 dilution of an ascites fluid .
All other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
CREB/ATF , mouse monoclonal 25C10G , ATF-1 , mouse monoclonal IgA C41-5.1 ; CREB-1 and CREM-1 , rabbit polyclonal IgG , respectively C-21 and X-12 .
Protein analysis Proteins were obtained by direct lysis of the cells in Laemmili 's loading buffer containing 6 mM urea and equal amounts were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophor-esis .
After transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane according to standard procedures , immunodetection was carried out with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody directed against a bacterially expressed human cyclin A ( Barlat et al .
, 1993 ) , using the Amersham chemilumines-cence detection system .
Proteins were quantified prior to electrophoresis using the Bradford assay and then by staining the membrane with Ponceau red .
