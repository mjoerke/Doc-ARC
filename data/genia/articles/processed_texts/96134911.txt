We have shown earlier that NF-M , the chicken homolog of C/EBPR , is specifically expressed in myelomonocytic and eosinophilic cells of the hematopoietic system .
To investigate the role of NF-M in hematopoietic cell lineage commit-ment , we constructed a conditional form of the protein by fusing it to the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor .
This construct was stably expressed in a multipotent progenitor cell line transformed by the Myb-Ets oncoprotein .
We report here that both NF-M-dependent promoter constructs and resident genes could be activated by addition of B-estradiol to the NF-M-estrogen receptor expressing progenitors .
At the same time , we observed a down-regulation of progenitor-specific surface markers and the up-regulation of differentiation markers restricted to the eosinophil and myeloid lineages .
In addition to the onset of differentiation , cell death was induced with typical apoptotic features .
Our results suggest that NF-M plays an important role in commitment along the eosinophil lineage and in the induction of apoptosis .
Keywords : cell transformation/nuclear oncogenes/stem cells/transcription factors Introduction Transcription factors of the C/EBPB ( CAAT/enhancer binding protein ) family are involved in differentiation and growth arrest of several cell types ( Umek et al .
, 1991 ; Freytag and Geddes , 1992 ) .
Common structural features of these proteins are highly conserved basic DNA binding and leucine zipper dimerization domains at the carboxyl-terminus and divergent amino-termini containing regulatory and transactivation domains ( Landschulz et a/ .
, 1988 , 1989 ; Pei and Shih , 1991 ; Kowenz-Leutz et al .
, 1994 ) .
The first member of this family , C/EBPa , was originally identified in liver tissue but is now known also to be expressed during later stages of adipocyte differentiation .
Ectopic expression of C/EBPa in adipo-blasts inhibits cell proliferation ( Umek et al .
, 1991 ) and activates genes characteristic for differentiated fat cells © Oxford University Press ( Christy et al .
, 1989 ; Herrera et al .
1989 ; Kaestner et al .
, 1990 ; Freytag et al .
, 1994 ) .
Conversely , C/EBP antisense RNA blocks terminal differentiation of adipoblasts , indicating that it is essential for adipocyte differentiation ( Lin and Lane , 1992 ) .
Similarly to what has been found in adipocyte differentiation , cessation of cell proliferation correlates with C/EBPB accumulation in the liver and ectopic expression of C/EBPB arrests hepatoma cell growth ( Buck et al .
, 1994 ) .
Another tissue in which C/EBP-type factors play a role is the hematopoietic system .
As observed for adipocyte maturation , myelomonocytic differentiation is paralleled by a distinct expression pattern of C/EBP proteins which , however , is different from that in adipocytes ( Cao et al .
, 1991 ; Natsuka et al .
, 1992 ; Scott et al .
, 1992 ) .
Thus , C/EBPB has been shown to be expressed and active in macrophages during the inflammatory reaction and acute phase response ( Akira et al .
, 1990 ; Poli et al .
, 1990 ; Akira and Kishimoto , 1992 ; Juan et al .
, 1993 ; Katz et al .
, 1993 ; Ramji et al .
, 1993 ; Pope et al .
, 1994 ) .
We have previously shown that NF-M , the chicken homolog of C/EBP $ , is expressed in the myelomonocytic lineage of the chicken hematopoietic system ( Sterneck et al .
, 1992a , b ; Katz et al .
, 1993 ) .
More recently , we also found it to be expressed in Myb-Ets-transformed eosinophils ( Kulessa et al .
, 1995 ) .
A role for NF-M during lineage commitment was suggested by the observation that NF-M expression was detected at an early stage during phorbol ester-induced differentiation of Myb-Ets-transformed multipotent precursor cells ( MEPs ) into eosinophils and myeloblasts ( Graf et al .
, 1992 ; Katz et al .
, 1993 ) .
Furthermore , NF-M was found to collaborate with both cellular and several viral forms of the Myb oncoprotein to activate the resident Myb target gene mim-1 even in heterologous cell types such as fibroblasts ( Burk et al .
, 1993 ; Ness et al .
, 1993 ) .
These data suggested that the combinatorial action of Myb and C/EBP proteins constitutes a bipartite switch which serves as a signal for the induction of myeloid-specific genes ( Ness et al .
, 1993 ) .
In addition , the finding that is regulated by activating signal transduc-tion pathways ( Wegner et al .
, 1992 ; Nakajima et al .
, 1993 ; Trautwein et al .
, 1993 ; Kowenz-Leutz et al .
, 1994 ) suggests that regulation of the factor is tightly linked to various onco-developmental cues .
Here we describe that activation of NF-M-estrogen receptor ( ER ) by estrogen in the MEP cell line HD57 caused a suppression of MEP -specific antigens and the expression of eosinophilic/myelomonocytic differentiation markers .
In addition , we observed massive cell death with typical features of apoptosis .
Our data suggest a role for NF-M ( C/EBP $ 3 ) in hematopoietic differentiation as well as in programed cell death .

Transient transfection of the NF-M-ER fusion protein .
The erythroblast cell line HD3 was transiently cotransfected with the NF-M-ER expression vector and two different luciferase reporter constructs containing either a palindromic NF-M binding site derived from the cMGF promotor ( pM82cMGF ) ( A ) or the erythroid-specific porphobilinogen deaminase gene promotor ( PBG Luc ) ( B ) which is not NF-M responsive .
Transfected cells were treated with B-estradiol ( 1 uM ) or mock treated .
Luciferase activity was determined 40 h after transfection and plotted as the mean of duplicates .
Results Construction of a hormone-inducible form of NF-M To investigate the function of NF-M in hematopoietic differentiation , we constructed a conditional form of the transactivator protein .
For this purpose , we fused the C-terminus of NF-M to the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor ( Greene et al .
, 1986 ) .
The chimeric construct is driven by the chicken B-actin promoter and carries the histidinol resistance gene as a selectable marker .
The effects of NF-M-ER were tested using a luciferase reporter driven by the cMGF promoter ( pM82 ) which contains a palindromic NF-M binding site ( Sterneck et al .
, 1992b ; Katz et al .
, 1993 ) .
Cotransfection of NF-M-ER and the reporter construct into the erythroblast cell line HD3 ( Beug et al .
, 1979 ) showed an ~20-fold increase of reporter expression after addition of B-estradiol as compared with the same cells in the absence of hormone or with cells transfected with the vector control ( Figure 1A ) .
In contrast , a reporter containing an NF-M-unresponsive promoter ( PBG luc containing the erythroid porphobilinogen deaminase gene promoter ) ( Frampton et al .
, 1990 ) was not activated by the NF-M-ER construct ( Figure 1B ) .
This experiment showed that the activity of the NF-M-ER fusion protein is hormone inducible and specific for NF-M target sites .
NF-M induces the expression of mim-1 in a transformed multipotent cell line To determine whether NF-M expression can induce the differentiation of multipotent hematopoietic cells , we transfected the NF-M-ER vector into the MEP cell line HD357 and seeded the cells in semi-solid medium in the presence of histidinol .
This cell line , which had been derived from chicken blastoderm cells transformed by the Gag-Myb-Ets fusion protein of the E26 virus , can be induced to differentiate into cells of the myelomonocytic 6128 Fig .

NF-M-ER fusion protein expression in HD57 MEP cells .
HD57 MEP cells were transfected with the NF-M-ER construct and selected in the presence of histidinol in semi-solid medium .
Fifteen resistant colonies ( # 1-15 ) were isolated and expanded in liquid medium .
Cell lysates were separated by gel electrophoresis , blotted and subjected to immunodetection using a polyclonal NF-M antiserum .
Lysates from HD11 macrophages which express NF-M ( C1 ) and from HD57 MEP cells which are devoid of NF-M ( C2 ) were included as positive and negative controls , respectively .
Twelve out of 15 clones express the NF-M-ER construct ( electrophoretic mobility is indicated by an arrowhead on the left ) .

and eosinophilic lineages ( Graf et al .
, 1992 ; Frampton et al .
, 1995 ; Kulessa et al .
, 1995 ) .
We obtained 15 stably transfected clones , 12 of which expressed the NF-M-ER fusion protein as determined by Western blot analysis ( Figure 2 ) .
Three of these clones ( cl.3 , c1.6 and cl.14 ) were used for further analysis .
Both the NF-M-ER-expressing clones and the parental HD57 MEP cells were treated with -estradiol for different time periods and examined by Northern analysis for expression of mim-1 as a myeloid/eosinophil-specific NF-M target gene ( Figure 3 ) .
In B-estradiol-treated NF-M-ER cells , mim-/-specific message was detectable within 1 h and still increased after 34 h of hormone treatment .
In contrast , mim-/ message was neither detected in the untreated NF-M-ER-expressing HD57 MEP cells nor in the parental cell line treated with B-estradiol ( Figure 3 ) .
This result shows that NF-M induces the expression of a myeloid/eosinophilic marker in a multipotent precursor cell line .
Next we asked whether the induction of genes is a direct effect of the transactivation potential of the chimeric NF-M-ER protein .
To examine this possibility , protein synthesis of c1.6 NF-M-ER cells was blocked with cycloheximide before treatment of the cells with B-estradiol .
The expression of was then determined by Northern blotting in NF-M-ER cells as well as in the parental cell line used as a control .
As can be seen in Figure 4 , the treatment with cycloheximide at a concentration that inhibits > 90 % of protein synthesis ( Kraut et al .
, 1995 ) did not inhibit the induction of mim-/ message by the hormone .
As expected , no mim-/ RNA was detectable in the parental cell line after the same treatment .
These results support the notion that NF-M directly induces the expression of a myeloid/eosinophil-specific gene in MEP cells .
NF-M induces the down-regulation of MEP/thrombocyte-specific markers and the up-regulation of eosinophilic markers To determine whether forced NF-M expression alters the phenotype of HD57 MEP cells , we examined expression of cell surface antigens by cytofluorometric analysis using mim-1 expression ( arbitrary units ) 4 B 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 hours of B-estradio !

Kinetics of mim-/ expression after activation of the NF-M-ER chimera .

Northern analysis with > °P-labeled DNA probes for mim-/ and chicken GAPDH was performed and radioactivity was evaluated by PhosphorImager analysis normalized to GAPDH expression and plotted .

specific monoclonal antibodies ( Figure 5A ) .
The expression of MEP21 and MEP26 , two surface antigens which are characteristic for MEP cells and normal thrombocytes , was strongly down-regulated within 3 days after B-estradiol treatment ( MEP26 : from 92 to 17 % ; MEP21 : from 94 to 38 % ) .
In parallel , the eosinophil-specific surface marker EOS47 was up-regulated in 40 % of the population .
In addition , 6 % of the viable hormone-treated cells expressed eosinophil-specific peroxidase while no peroxidase-positive cells could be detected in the controls ( data not shown ) .
No changes in surface marker expression were observed after -estradiol treatment of the parental cell line ( data not shown ) .
In another experiment , the time course of the altered expression of MEP21 , MEP26 and EOS47 antigens was determined .
As can be seen in Figure 5B , a significant decrease of the MEP antigens was already observed after 1 day of B-estradiol treatment , while the number of EOS47 antigen-positive cells increased only after 2 days .
Finally , no increase in the expression of the myelomonocytic-specific cell surface antigens MYLS1/2 and 4M12 could be detected even 4 days after hormone treatment of the cells .
These data indicate that NF-M expression causes the down-regulation of MEP/thrombocyte-specific cell surface antigens and the up-regulation of eosinophil-specific markers .
NF-M is expressed in normal cells of the eosinophilic lineage The results presented , together with the earlier observation that NF-M is expressed in Myb-Ets-transformed eosinophils ( Kulessa et al .
, 1995 ) , suggest a role for NF-M in the differentiation of eosinophilic in addition to myelomonocytic cells .
However , this could also represent an artefact of transformed cells lines .
Therefore , to test whether normal eosinophils also express NF-M , we prepared chicken bone marrow and performed in situ peroxidase staining to reveal the eosinophils ( Brune and Spitznagel , 1973 ; Graf et al .
, 1992 ) .

Activation of myelomonocytic genes by NF-M-ER is protein synthesis independent .
NF-M-ER-expressing cells ( c1.6 , 2X 10 `` cells/ lane ) and parental HDS57 MEP cells were treated with cycloheximide ( 50 ug/ml ) or mock treated as indicated 30 min before addition of B-estradiol ( 1 uM ) .
Cells were harvested 2.5 h later and poly ( A ) * RNA was subjected to a Northern analysis with *°P-labeled DNA probes for NF-M , mim- ] and GAPDH , as indicated .
rescence with polyclonal NF-M antiserum and examined microscopically .
All of the peroxidase-positive cells with an intact nucleus were also NF-M positive .
In addition , a relatively high proportion of cells could be observed which were peroxidase negative but NF-M positive .
Most of the latter probably represent myelomonocytic cells ( Katz et al .
, 1993 ) and possibly immature eosinophils .
This is illustrated in Figure 6 which shows two NF-M-positive cells ( Figure 6A ) , one of which exhibits characteristic peroxidase-positive granules ( Figure 6B ) .
This shows that NF-M is not only expressed in normal myelomonocytic cells but also in normal eosinophilic cells .
Activation of the NF-M-ER in HD57 MEP cells also induces apoptosis During the course of the experiments described above , we observed that when NF-M-ER cells were treated for more than 2 days with B-estradiol , a large proportion of the cells died .
Figure 7A and B show the kinetics of cell death , as determined by trypan blue exclusion for two NF-M-ER-expressing HD57 MEP clones following hormone addition .
After 4 days of B-estradiol treatment , cell viability was reduced to ~10 and 30 % , respectively .
This effect was not due to a toxicity of the hormone since the parental cell line remained fully viable ( Figure 7C ) .
To determine whether this effect was due to the cryptic transactivation potential of the estrogen binding domain , the cells were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 40HT ) .
This estrogen antagonist still dissociates the hormone receptor from the heat shock protein Hsp90 ( Catelli et al .
, 1985 ; Rebbe et al .
, 1987 ; Picard et al .
, 1988 ) whilst selectively blocking its cryptic transactivation potential ( Berry et al .
, 1990 ; Pham et al .
, 1991 ) .
As shown in Figure 7A and B , 40HT treatment exibited the same ability as B-estradiol to cause cell death .
When the cells were seeded in semi-solid medium in the presence of B-estradiol and histidinol , a small number of colonies was obtained .
However , of 14 such clones examined , none 6129 C.Miller ot al .

Changes in the surface marker composition induced by the activated NF-M-ER .
( A ) Surface marker expression of NF-M-ER-expressing cells ( cl.6 ) was determined by cytofluorometric analysis after treatment for 3 days with B-estradiol ( 150 nM , lower panel ) or with solvent ( upper panel ) in the presence of histidinol ( 1 mg/mi ) and recombinant cMGF .

expressed the NF-M-ER fusion protein as determined by Western blotting ( data not shown ) .
These data indicate that NF-M causes cell death and that selection for clones that have lost NF-M-ER expression protects them from estrogen-induced cell death .
Since hematopoietic differentiation is often accompanied by programed cell death , we examined whether NF-M induces apoptosis .
First , the integrity of nuclear DNA was determined , as most apoptotic cells contain degraded chromosomal DNA by endonuclease digestion ( Caron-Leslie et al .
, 1991 ; Ucker et al .
, 1992 ; Barry and Eastman , 1993 ; Peitsch et al .
, 1993 ) .
This can be visualized by gel electrophoresis as a 'DNA ladder ' with a typical 200 bp periodicity .
We therefore examined , by gel electrophoresis , cellular DNA from two NF-M-ER-expressing clones and from the parental cell line before and after treatment with fB-estradiol .
The characteristic 'ladder ' pattern of DNA ( Figure 8A ) was observed 24-36 h after estrogen activation of the NF-M-ER protein , indicating that death had occurred through apoptosis .
Only traces of DNA degradation were found in untreated NF-M-ER-expressing cells or in the parental cell line before or after treatment with B-estradiol .
In a separate experiment , B-estradiol-treated cells were cytocentrifuged and tested in the 'TUNEL ' assay .
In this assay , DNA strand breaks are detected by treating the cells with terminal transferase and fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -coupled dUTP which is subsequently visualized by fluorescence microscopy ( Gavrieli et al .
, 1992 ) .
As shown in Figure 8B and Table I , 60 % of the NF-M-ER cells stained positive 24 h after addition of B-estradiol , while < 0.5 % positive cells were detected in the untreated samples or in the parental cells treated with B-estradiol .
Finally , to test whether the B-estradiol-treated NF-M-ER cells also exhibit chromatin and nuclear condensations , they were centrifuged onto slides and the DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidin-2-indole dihydrochloride ( DAPI ) .

The fluorescence micrograph ( A ) shows two cells expressing nuclear NF-M staining .
The bright field micrograph of the same field ( B ) reveals one of them as an eosinophil .
shown in Figure 8C and Table I , 49 % of the NF-M-ER-expressing cells had condensed nuclei 24 h after B-estradiol treatment .
In contrast , < 1 % of the corresponding untreated cells or the parental cell line showed similar DNA con-densations .
Taken together , our data indicate that , in addition to its ability to induce eosinophil differentiation , NF-M is a potent inducer of programed cell death in HD57 MEP cells .
Discussion To study the effects of NF-M ( C/EBPP ) on hematopoietic differentiation , we used HD57 MEP cells expressing a conditional NF-M derivative .
These cells possess differentiation potential towards myelomonocytic , eosinophilic , erythroid and thrombocytic lineages ( Graf et al .
, 1992 ; Frampton et al .
, 1995 ; Kulessa et al .
1995 ) and lack NF-M expression ( Katz et al .
, 1993 ) .

Activation of NF-M-ER induces cell death .
1 X 10° cells from two NF-M-ER-expressing clones , cl.3 ( A ) and cl.14 ( B ) , or from the parental cell line ( C ) were seeded in the presence of histidinol ( 1 mg/ml ) and recombinant cMGF and treated with B-estradiol ( 1 uM ) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 40HT , 1 uM ) for 5 days .
Aliquots were removed daily and the percentage of viable cells was determined by trypan blue staining as the mean of duplicates ( circles : without hormone ; triangles : plus B-estradiol ; squares : plus 4O0HT ) .
induced differentiation of MEP cells into the myeloid lineage correlated with the induction of NF-M expression ( Katz et al .
, 1993 ) .
Here we show that the mim-1 gene is induced rapidly after -estradiol activation of the NF-M-ER fusion protein in HD57 MEP cells .
This gene is regulated directly by Myb and C/EBPRB in cells of the myelomonocytic and eosinophilic lineages ( Ness et al .
, 1989 , 1993 ; Kulessa et al .
, 1995 ) .
Furthermore , activation of the NF-M-ER chimera led to the expression of two eosinophilic differentiation markers , the surface antigen EOS47 and eosinophil peroxidase ( Graf et al .
, 1992 ) .
Apart from the activation of eosinophil-specific genes , NF-M also caused down-regulation of antigens characteristic for the early progenitor stage of MEP cells , a process which goes beyond the mere induction of target genes in heterologous cells .
Taken together , these data suggest that NF-M activation causes eosinophilic lineage commitment of hematopoietic precursors .
Originally NF-M expression could only be detected in myelomonocytic cells of the hematopoietic system ( Katz et al .
, 1992 ; Scott et al .
, 1992 ) .
Recently , however , NF-M was also found to be expressed in eosinophilic cells derived from a myeloblast cell line by ectopic expression of GATA-1 ( Kulessa et al .
, 1995 ) , a finding which could be extended to normal eosinophils in the present study .
Since eosinophils derived either from myelomonocytic cells or from MEP cells showed the concomitant expression of c-Myb , in addition to NF-M and GATA-1 , while myelomonocytic cells lack GATA-1 ( Kulessa et al .
, 1995 ) , it is tempting to speculate that the balance between these three transcription factors plays a decisive role in lineage determination .
In agreement with this idea is the observation that activation of GATA-1 represses myelomonocytic gene expression ( Kulessa et al .
, 1995 ) .
We postulate , therefore , that the decision for lineage commitment of MEP cells ( and possibly also of normal progenitor cells ) is influenced by the presence or absence of NF-M ( C/EBPRB ) and GATA-1 on a background of Myb expres-sion .
If GATA-1 is expressed in the absence of NF-M , progenitors can differentiate into the thrombocytic and Differentiation and apoptosis induced by C/EBPB 1 2 3 4 5 6 Fig .

erythroid lineages .
However , when NF-M is expressed in the absence of GATA-1 , possibly in combination with a second factor ( see below ) , myelomonocytic differentiation is favored .
Furthermore , the combination of both factors , GATA-1 and NF-M , would allow differentiation towards the eosinophilic lineage .
The decisions may also depend on the relative expression levels of the individual transcription factors .
In earlier studies , we have shown that phorbol ester 6131 C.Muller et al .
induces MEP cell differentiation towards either the myelomonocytic or the eosinophilic lineage , depending on whether high or low TPA concentrations were used ( Graf et al .
, 1992 ) .
In the present study , however , B-estradiol-induced activation of the NF-M-ER chimera led to the differentiation of eosinophils only .
Failure to obtain myelomonocytic cells could indicate that is not as efficient as other transcription factors of the C/EBP family such as C/EBPa , which is expressed in immature myelomonocytic cells but , in contrast to C/EBPB , disappears during differentiation ( Scott et al .
, 1992 ) .
Another possibility is that additional transcription factors are missing which act in concert with NF-M or C/EBP to sustain myelomonocytic differentiation .
This possibility would be reminiscent of C/EBPa-induced adipocytic differentiation , which requires another adipocyte-specific factor , the lipid-activatable nuclear hormone receptor PPARy2 ( Tontonoz et al .
, 1994 ) .
Since C/EBP proteins are expressed in differentiating cells of several tissues like fat , liver , intestine , skin and the hematopoietic system , synergizing partner proteins might always be required to control completion of the C/EBP-induced differentiation process in a tissue-specific manner .
Another possible explanation for the failure to detect myelomonocytic differentiation is that the cells die because suitable growth factors are missing ( Williams et al .
, 1990 ) .
We have previously shown that growth , survival and differentiation of chicken - myeloblasts/promyelocytes depend on the G-CSF/Il-6-related chicken myelomonocytic growth factor , cMGF ( Leutz et al .
, 1989 ) .
Although the experiments were performed in the presence of cMGF , cell death could not be inhibited .
This could reflect either the absence of cMGF receptor in estrogen-treated NF-M-ER-expressing cells or the requirement for yet another growth factor .
We tried to circumvent the supposed factor dependence by ectopic expression of either the mammalian erythropoietin receptor or the G-CSF receptor , which are functional in chicken cells ( Steinlein et al .
, 1994 ; C.Miiller , unpublished observations ) .
However , neither erythropoietin nor G-CSF treatment of these cells prevented their hormone-induced death ( data not shown ) .
Finally , the inability of NF-M-ER cells to differentiate into myelomonocytic cells might also have more trivial reasons .
Thus , we found that the NF-M-ER clones partially or completely lost their capacitiy to differentiate when treated with TPA ( T.Graf , unpublished data ) .
The fact that this is also seen with most HD57-derived subclones suggests that our culture conditions favor the outgrowth of cells that are unable to differentiate .
Several transcription factors normally involved in driving cells into proliferation have been shown to induce apoptosis when expressed inappropriately in resting cells .
This has led to the suggestion that programed cell death occurs when quiescent cells receive an incomplete set of signals required for proliferation ( Evan et al .
, 1992 ; Wu and Levine , 1994 ) .
Our data provide an example for the converse situation , namely of a transcription factor involved in cell differentiation that can act as an inducer of apoptosis when activated in multiplying cells .
This suggests that apoptosis in the hematopoietic system might be provoked not only by incomplete proliferation commands but by incomplete differentiation commands as well .
Whether or not NF-M-induced differentiation and 6132 apoptosis represent alternative fates of MEP cells is an interesting question which remains to be studied .
Is the observed apoptotic activity of NF-M relevant for the hematopoietic differentiation process ?
Several observations support this possibility .
Thus , phorbol ester-induced MEP differentiation is accompanied by the apop-topic death of a significant but variable proportion of the cell population ( Graf et al .
, 1992 ; T.Graf , preliminary results ) .
Similarly , phorbol ester-induced differentiation of v-myb-transformed myeloblasts into macrophages also causes extensive cell death by apoptosis ( Smarda and Lipsick , 1994 ) .
Finally , it has been shown that activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) mediates phorbol ester-induced apoptosis in activated human macrophages , a process which seems to be independent of the presence of growth factors ( Munn et al .
, 1995 ) .
Since PKC activation strongly enhances C/EBPB-NF-M transcription in myelomonocytic cells ( Katz et al .
, 1993 ; Trautwein et al .
, 1993 ; Kowenz-Leutz et al .
, 1994 ) , PKC-mediated apoptosis in these cells might occur via activation of C/EBPRB-NF-M. On the other hand , the situation in HD57 MEP cells might be different , as apoptosis and gene activation induced by the chimeric NF-M-ER protein occur even in the absence of activated PKC .
However , this discrepancy might be explained by failure of proper regulation of NF-M in the ER context following activation by fB-estradiol .
Since activation of NF-M by kinases is due to derepression , probably involving a conformational change of the protein ( Kowenz-Leutz et al .
, 1994 ) , hormone binding to the chimeric protein might cause a similar structural alteration in NF-M. As NF-M exhibits a highly modular structure , it would be interesting to know which domains are necessary for its capacity to induce apoptosis .
Preliminary evidence based on mutational analysis indicates that apoptosis is critically dependent on its transactivation domains ( Kowenz-Leutz et al .
, 1994 ) implying that one or more genes have to be induced to mediate cell killing .
It will be important to identify these genes which are likely to play a vital role in hematopoietic homeostasis .
In addition , it will be interesting to see whether growth inhibition in other cell types following NF-M-CEBPB activation is based on the same structural features of NF-M necessary for induction of apoptosis in myeloid cells , or whether these functions exhibit cell type specificity .
Materials and methods Vector construction An NF-M HindIII-BamHI fragment which contains the complete coding region and translational initiation site ( Katz et al .
, 1993 ) was fused at its carboxyl-terminus in-frame to a BamHI-BamHI fragment which contained the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor ( amino acids 282-595 ) ( Greene et al .
, 1986 ) and the polyadenylation signal of the herpes virus thymidine kinase gene , both derived from the C/EBPO®-ER expression vector ( Umek et al .
, 1991 ) .
The chimeric construct was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector # 321 ( Buerstedde and Takeda , 1991 ) , where it was transcibed from the chicken B-actin promoter .
In addition , the vector carried a histidinol resistance gene driven by the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat .
Cloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing and the function and inducibility of the construct was tested by transient transfection experiments using cMGF promoter-luciferase reporter constructs ( Sterneck et al .
, 1992b ) .
Cells and tissue culture Cells were incubated under tissue culture conditions in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO ; at 39°C .
HDS7 MEP cells were propagated in phenol red-free medium-mix [ 350 ml of Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium without phenol red ( Gibco ) , 50 ml of bidest , 50 ml of fetal calf serum , 12.5 ml of chicken serum ( not heat-treated ) , 13 ml of 7.5 % NaHCO , 1.9 m !
of 15 mg/ml conalbumin , 275 pl of 1.7 mg/ml insulin , 800 ul of 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol , 9 ml of 20 % glucose solution and the standard complement of antibiotics ] ( Graf et al .
, 1992 ) .
In order to activate the NF-M-ER fusion protein , B-estradiol or 4-0HT was added to the medium in a final concentration of 1 uM and the medium was supplemented with 200 U/ml of recombinant cMGF ( Leutz et al .
, 1989 ) .
To inhibit protein biosynthesis , cycloheximide was added at 50 pg/ml final concentration .
Transient transfection The erythroblast cell line HD3 ( v-erbA , v-erbB-transformed ; Beug et al .
, 1979 ) was transfected by a DEAE-dextran procedure as described in detail by Sterneck er al .
( 1992b ) .
The effector plasmid DNA concentration was 0.6 and 1 ug/ml with the luciferase reporters .
Cells were transfected with 0.3 mg/ml DEAE-dextran in STBS solution ( Ausubel et al .
, 1987 ) , treated with B-estradiol in a final concentration of 1 uM or with solvent , harvested after 40 h and lysed in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer , pH 7.8 by three freeze-thaw cycles .
The extracts were cleared by centrifugation and 30 pl were assayed for luciferase activity as described ( de Wet er al .
, 1987 ; Sterneck et al .
, 1992b ) .
Assays were done in duplicate .
Stable transfection Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and resuspended in PBS at 1 X 10 cells/45 ul .
The plasmid DNA was purified twice on CsCl gradients and resuspended in PBS in a concentration of I ug/ul .
For each electroporation , 5 ug of the DNA ( 5 ul ) were mixed with 1X 10 `` cells ( 45 Jl ) and transferred into an electroporation cuvette with an electrode gap of 0.4 cm ( Bio-Rad ) .
Electroporation was performed with a capacity of 250 uF and a voltage of 200 V which resulted in a time constant of 12-15 ms ( Gene Pulser Apparatus , Bio-Rad ) .
Electro-porated cells were resuspended and seeded in 5 ml of medium-mix without phenol red .
After 1-2 days , different concentrations of cells were seeded in semi-solid medium containing 2 % methylcellulose ( Methocel , Fulka ) in phenol red-free medium-mix with a histidinol concentration of 3 mg/ml .
Fourteen days later histidinol-resistant colonies were isolated and transferred to 500 ul of fresh medium-mix without phenol red which contained 1 mg/ml histidinol .
Resistant clones were propagated and examined for NF-M-ER fusion protein expression by Western blotting .
Western blot analysis Western blotting was performed with total cell lysates as indicated .
Cells were lysed in 0.5 M NaOH , the lysate was then neutralized with 0.5 M HCI and mixed with 6X SDS loading buffer .
An equivalent of 2.5 % 10° cells was subjected to reducing 10 % SDS-PAGE and proteins were subsequently electrophoretically transferred onto a membrane ( Millipore , PVDF membrane ) .
Membranes were blocked with 5 % non-fat dry milk in TBST ( 150 mM NaCl .
50 mM Tris-HCI , pH 7.4 and 0.02 % v/v Tween-20 ) for 2 h and incubated for 2 h with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against trpE-NF-M ( Katz et al .
, 1993 ) diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution .
Filters were washed four times and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled second antibody ( Bio-Rad ) for 2 h. The blots were washed four times and immunoreactivity was detected with a chemoluminescence system ( ECL ; Amersham International ) .
Northern blot analysis Total RNA was prepared using a guanidinium isothiocyanate method ( Chomezynski and Sacchi , 1987 ) .
The poly ( A ) * fraction was isolated by oligo ( dT ) coupled to magnetic beads ( Dynal ) .
RNA was separated on a 1 % formaldehyde agarose gel , transferred to Hybond membranes ( Amersham ) , UV cross-linked and backed at 80°C for 2 h. The blots were probed in QuickHyb hybridization solution ( Stratagene ) at 65°C for 3 h with appropriate random *°P-labeled ( Pharmacia , Amersham ) DNA fragments .
The restriction fragments used as probes for GAPDH and mim-1 have been described earlier ( Ness er al .
, 1989 ; Dugaiczyk et al .
, 1983 ) .
Subsequently , the hybridization filters were washed twice for 15 min with 1X SSC , 0.1 % SDS at room temperature and twice with 0.5 % SSC , 0.1 % SDS for 15 min at 60°C and exposed to Kodak X- OMAT-AR X-ray films or processed by PhosphorImager analysis ( Fuji ) .
Cytofluorometric analysis The MEP-specific monoclonal antibodies MEP21 and MEP26 and the eosinophilic-specific monoclonal antibody EOS47 have been described Differentiation and apoptosis induced by C/EBPB earlier ( McNagny et al .
, 1992 ) .
Cytofluorometric analysis was performed using FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies .
The second antibody alone was used as a negative control .
Antigen-positive cells , negative for propidium iodide uptake , were evaluated using the Becton Dickinson FACScan cytometer .
For the detection of NF-M expression , cells were fixed with 3.7 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , lysed with 0.05 % NP-40 and stained with a polyclonal NF-M-specific antiserum .
As second antibodies , FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were used .
Peroxidase staining Cells were suspended in 50 ul of medium to which 20 pil of peroxidase reagent was added for 30 min at room temperature .
Peroxidase-positive cells stained dark brown .
Determination of cell viability Cells ( 1X10° ) were seeded in 5 ml of phenol red-free medium-mix containing 1 mg/ml histidinol and 200 U of recombinant cMGF .
B-Estradiol ( 1 uM ) or the solvent alone in control experiments was added as indicated .
Aliquots ( 50 pl ) from the cultures were taken daily and mixed with 50 pl of concentrated trypan blue stain solution ( Gibco ) .
The total cell number and the number of dead cells were determined by microscopic evaluation using a Neubauer counting chamber .
Alternatively , cells were immobilized on a microscopy glass slide by cytocentrifugation , incubated with DAPI solution ( 100 ug DAPI/ml methanol ) for 10 min at room temperature and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy .
To perform the TUNEL assay , cells were immobilized by cytocentri-fugation and fixed with 3.7 % paraformaldehyde solution in PBS for 30 min at room temperature .
They were then washed once with PBS , permeabilized in 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 0.1 % sodium citrate for 2 min at 4°C and washed twice with PBS .
The TUNEL reaction was performed by incubation in a moist chamber with 0.3 nmol of FITC-12-dUTP ( Boehringer Mannheim ) 3 nmol of dATP , 2 ul of 25 mM CoCl ; , , 25 U of terminal transferase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) and TdT buffer ( 30 mM Tris pH 7.2 , 140 mM sodium cacodylate ) in a total volume of 50 pul for 1 h at 37°C .
The reaction was stopped by adding 2 pl of 0.5 M EDTA .
Slides were washed twice in PBS and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy .
DNA ladder assay Cells ( 2 10° ) were harvested , washed twice in 140 mM sodium chloride , 20 mM EDTA and incubated in lysis buffer ( 200 mM Tris pH 8.3 , 100 mM EDTA , 50 ug/ml proteinase K , 1 % SDS ) at 37°C for 4 h. The DNA was extracted by adding an equal volume of phenol followed by centrifugation .
The aqueous phase was dialyzed overnight against 10 mM Tris pH 7.5 , 1 mM EDTA .
Then EDTA was added to a final concentration of 25 mM and the DNA solution was incubated with RNase A ( 50 ug/mi ) for 3 h at 37°C followed by incubation with proteinase K ( 120 ug/ml ) for 3 h at 37°C .
After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation , the DNA pellet was gently resuspended in 50 pl of TE and 3 ug of DNA were separated on a 1.5 % agarose gel containing EtBr .
