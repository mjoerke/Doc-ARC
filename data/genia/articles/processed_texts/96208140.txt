Galectin-3 is a Bgalactoside-bind-ing lectin previously designated as eBP ( IgE-binding protein ) , CBP35 , Mac-2 , L-29 , and L-34 , and its expression has been associated with var-tous physiological and pathological processes , including cell growth , tumor transformation , and metastasis .
Galectin-3 is widely distributed in various tissues and cell types and is expressed in many leukocytes , with the notable exception of B and T lymphocytes .
We now report that galectin-3 is abundantly expressed in a number of human T lymphotropic virus ( HTLV ) -L-infected buman T cell lines , including F6T , HUT 102 , K3T , MT-2 , and SLB-I , but is not expressed in non-HTLV-L-infected T cell lines such as Jurkat , CEM , and MOLT-4 .
In addition , the galectin-3 level was markedly increased in buman thymocytes after infection with HTLV-I as compared with uninfected thymocytes .
The up-regulation of galectin-3 expression appeared to correlate well with HTLV-I gene expression , as undetectable or very low levels of galectin-3 were found in the S1T and ATL-1K cell lines , which are nonproductively infected with HTLV-I In co-transfection experi-ments , the galectin-3 promoter was significantly up-regulated by expression vectors encoding the 40-kd Tax protein , a potent transactivator in HTLV-L Analysis of various Tax mutants suggested that galectin-3 promoter induction is dependent on activation of the cyclic-AMP-responsive element binding protein/activation transcription factor family of transcription factors and , to a lesser extent , nuclear factor-kB/ Rel induction .
Transfection of buman promonocytic U-937 cells with an HTLV-I Tax expression vector induced galectin-3 expression in this cell line .
Functionally , galectin-3 was shown to activate interleukin-2 production in Jurkat T cells .
Together , these findings raise the possibility that HTLV-I Tax production induces the transcription and subsequent synthesis and secretion of galectin-3 , which in turn may further activate these T cells and contribute to the altered properties of cell growth found in adult T cell leukemia induced by HTLV-L ( Am J Pathol 1996 , 148:1661-1670 ) Human T leukemia/lymphoma virus ( HTLV ) - !

In this communica-tion , we report that HTLV-I infection of T cells results in a marked increase in expression of the B-galactoside-binding lectin , galectin-3 , and furthermore , that these effects involve the action of the viral transactivator Tax .
Galectin-3 is a member of a newly defined and growing family of animal lectins®© previously designated as IgE-binding protein ( eBP ) for its IgE-binding activity `` ~* and as CBP35 , `` ° `` CBP30 , `` * L-29 , ' 5 and L-34 . '
5 `` `` This M , 31,000 protein is composed of two apparent domains ; the amino-terminal domain consists primarily of tandem repeats of nine amino acids and the carboxyl-terminal domain contains the carbohydrate-binding region .
'® Studies from a number of laboratories suggest that galectin-3 may have a wide range of functions .
This lectin was found to be up-regulated in proliferating fibroblasts as compared with quiescent cells , and the protein was found to be located in the nucleus of the proliferating cells , suggesting an association of its expression with cell More recent preliminary data have suggested a positive role for this protein in pre-mRNA splic-ing .
? ``
Expression of galectin-3 has also been correlated with the neoplastic transformation and metastatic potential of tumor cells .
? ``
Galectin-3 is also present on the cell surface , and the laminin-bind-ing activity of this lectin has been identified .
?
?
? ``
Thus , this lectin may play a role in cell adhesion to basement membranes .
? ``
Finally , galectin-3 is secreted by various and may function extracellularly to modulate various properties of different cell types .
`` © The distribution of galectin-3 is quite diverse , and its expression in various leukocytes has been observed , including neutrophils , `` `` macro-and eosinophils .
? ``
In view of the wide tissue distribution of galectin-3 , it is remarkable that this lectin is not present or only sparingly expressed in normal lymphocytes and several lymphoid cell lines. ``
? ``
However , recent studies involving the HTLV-l-infected T cell line HUT 102 revealed that galectin-3 consistently co-purified with the viral envelope protein gp46 ( S. R. Hammes and W. C. Greene , unpublished results ) .
This finding prompted us to perform more extensive analyses of the relationship between galectin-3 expression and HTLV-I infection and the mechanism underlying its unexpected expression in these immortalized human T cells .
Materials and Methods Reagents Recombinant human galectin-3 was prepared as described . ``
Rabbit polyclonal anti-human galectin-3 was generated using a standard protocol as previously described . ``

The remaining cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco 's minimal essential medium or RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L glu-tamine .
Detection of Galectin-3 by Immunoblotting Analysis Cell lysates were prepared as previously de-scribed , ** and galectin-3 present in the lysates was purified by affinity adsorption with lactosyl-Sepharose 4B* `` and detected by immunoblotting analysis .
Specifically , cell lysates containing 100 to 400 ug of total cellular proteins were adsorbed with 25 ul of lactosyl-Sepharose 4B , and bound proteins were eluted and resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide ge !
electrophoresis .
`` ° Separated proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) by electroblotting , * `` and galectin-3 was detected by using a rabbit anti-galectin-3 antibody followed HTLV-I Infection Induces Galectin-3 Expression in T Lymphocytes - 1663 by goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and chemiluminescent detection using a Tropix kit ( Bedford , MA ) or by '*°l-labeled protein A and autoradiography .
Quantitative comparisons of galectin-3 were performed by adsorption of equivalent protein contents from each cell lysate .
Densitometry was performed on an LKB Uitroscan XL .
Construction of Expression Vectors HTLV-I Tax wild-type ( pcTaxWT ) and mutant expression vectors transactivating through the cyclic-AMP-responsive element binding protein/activation transcription factor ( CREB/ATF ) pathway , pceTaxM22 ( HTLV-I Tax expression vector impaired for CREB/ ATF transactivation pathway only ) , the nuclear factor ( NF ) - « B/Re !
l pathway , peTaxM47 ( HTLV- !
Tax expression vector impaired for NF- « B/Rel pathway only ) , and inactive vectors peTaxM20 , peTaxM21 , and pcTaxM44 were described previously .
*® In brief , mutant vectors generated by site-directed mutagen-esis resulted in replacement of wild-type amino acid residues to Ala-Ser at '*'Thr-Leu for peTaxM22 ( The location of pcTaxM22 has been confirmed to be different from that published earlier .

* `` ) , for peTaxM20 , '***Pro-Asp for peTaxM21 , or the replacement to Arg-Ser at position ° `` % Leu-Leu for peTaxM47 .
Mutants were evaluated for their abilities to induce the CREB/ATF or NF- « B/ Rel transcription pathways by their influence on HTLV-I long terminal repeats or HIV- long terminal repeat promoters , The murine galectin-3 promoter region , `` `` from the BsrBI site in exon I and approximately 2 kb upstream to an EcoRI site was obtained by gel purification of the appropriate band and inserted into the pCAT-basic vector ( Promega , Madison , WI ) to drive an Escherichia-coli-derived _ chloramphenicol _ acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene .
The pCAT-basic vector used did not contain enhancer elements other than those introduced within the insert .
Transfection of Cells The murine B lymphoid cell line M12.4.5 was cultured in Dulbecco 's minimal essential medium ( Bio-Whittaker , Walkerville , MD ) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone , Salt Lake City , UT ) and 2 mmol/L glutamine and transfected by electroporation . ``

Analysis of DNA Sequences The promoter region of the murine galectin-3 gene was analyzed with the GCG program , `` `` and the motifs corresponding to transcription factors were derived from the transcription factor database . ``
Activation of Jurkat E6-1 Cells and Assays for IL-2 Recombinant human galectin-3 ( 4 to 100 ug/ml ) was added to Jurkat E6-1 cells and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C .
IL-2 released from treated cells into the media was quantified by an assay based on the proliferation of an IL-2-dependent cell line , CTLL-2 , determined by the formazan method using the 3- ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2-yl ) -5- ( 3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl ) -2- ( 4-sulfophenyl ) -H-tetrazolium , inner salt ; substrate ( Promega ) .
Recombinant IL-2 was used as standard in the assay .

Expression of galectin-3 in buman T cells infected with HTLV-I .
Expression of galectin-3 in cells was measured by immunobloting of cell lysates using a rabbit anti-galectin-3 antibody and chemiluminescent or '* `` I autoradiographic detection .
Lysates containing 100 ug of protein were adsorbed on lactosyl-Sepharose 4B , resolved on 12.5 % polyacrylamide , and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes .
Galectin-3 was detected by serial incubations with rabbit anti-galectin-3 , alkaline phosphatase , or '** I-labeled secondary antibody and developed with AMPPD or autoradiography , respectively .

As shown in Figure 1A , significant amounts of galectin-3 were present in HTLV-l-infected F6T , HUT 102 , MT-2 , and SLB-I cell lines .
In contrast , galectin-3 was not detectable in the uninfected cell lines Jurkat , CEM , and MOLT-4 ( Figure 1A ) nor in Jurkat E6-1 and CEM cells activated by phytohemagglutinin and phorbol ester ( data not shown ) .
Isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes also contained only low levels of galectin-3 ( data not shown ) .
The expression of galectin-3 appeared to generally correlate with the level of the HTLV-I viral gene product , as shown by almost undetectable or no galectin-3 in the nonproductively infected lines S1T and ATL-1K , respectively , which are infected with HTLV-I but do not express viral proteings . }
® > ° Correlation of HTLV-I infection with galectin-3 expression was further demonstrated by significantly enhanced galectin-3 expression in human thymocytes after infection .
The level of galectin-3 in HTLV-l-infected thymocytes was 4.7-fold greater than uninfected thy mocytes , as determined by immunoblotting and den-sitometric analysis ( Figure 1B ) .
Influence of HTLV-I Tax Expression Vectors on Activity of the Murine Galectin-3 Promoter Productive infection of cells with HTLV-I results in the synthesis of the transactivating factor Tax , which up-regulates a number of cellular genes via effects on both CREB/ATF and NF-B/Rel transcription factor pathways .
?
Each pathway is independent of the other and can be differentially activated by various mutants of HTLV-I Tax . ``
The roles of CREB/ATF and NF- « B/Re !
in regulation of the galectin-3 gene can , therefore , be studied by co-transfection of the appropriate HTLV-l Tax expression vector and the galectin-3 promoter coupled to a CAT reporter gene .
The influence of the HTLV-I Tax protein on the galectin-3 promoter was studied using the murine B cell line M12.4.5 , which does not express galectin-3 .

The murine galectin-3 promoter was introduced upstream of a bacterial CAT gene to form the pGalec3-CAT expression vector .
Co-transfection of M12.4.5 cells were performed by electroporation with pGalec3-CAT and HTLV-I Tax expression vectors pcTaxWT ( wild type ) , pcTaxM22 ( induces the CREB/ ATF pathway ) , pcTaxM47 ( induces the pathway ) , and control vectors pcTaxM20 , pcTaxM21 , and pcTaxM44 that retain neither CREB/ATF nor NF-kB/Re !

CAT activity was measured on day 2 by differential phase transfer using [ dickloroacetyl-1.2- ' `` C ) -chlorampbenicol and n-butylcoenzyme A .
A 20-ug amount of each vector was used to transfect 4 X 10° cells .
All values were corrected for basal CAT activity reflective of transfection with the promoter-less CAT expression vector and are expressed relative to pGalec3-CAT alone ( unity ) .
Data are means of duplicate transfections , shown with error bars indicating the high value .
These results are representative of two experiments .
demonstrated by the CAT activity in Figure 2 , the galectin-3 promoter was considerably up-regulated by the wild-type Tax expression vector ( pcTaxWT ) , which is known to stimulate both CREB/ATF and NF- « B/Rel transcription factor pathways .
`` ° In contrast , control vectors pcTaxM20 , pcTaxM21 , and peTaxM44 , which fail to induce through either pathway , induced only low levels of CAT activity .
The pcTaxM22 and pcTaxM47 mutant vectors , containing CREB/ATF-inducible and NF- « B/Rel-inducible activities , respectively , `` ° were also able to up-regulate the galectin-3 promoter .
pcTaxM22 was almost as effective as pcTaxWT in up-regulating the galectin-3 promoter , whereas pcTaxMA47 was less effec-tive .
Induction of Galectin-3 Expression in Human Promonocytic U-937 Cells In an effort to investigate the influence of Tax on the galectin-3 promoter under permissive conditions in the native state , the wild-type HTLV-I Tax expression vector was transfected into the human promonocytic line U-937 .
These cell types are known to express galectin-3 upon differentiation and are thus suitable for this purpose . ``

Activation of Jurkat E6-1 Cells by Galectin-3 A consequence of galectin-3 expression in T lymphocytes is that this lectin may activate the cells in an autocrine fashion by binding and cross-linking appropriately glycosylated cell surface receptors through mechanisms similar to mitogenic activities of plant lectins .
As shown in Figure 5 , galectin-3 activated Jurkat E6-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner , as determined by IL-2 secretion from treated cells .
Significant activation was observed with galectin-3 at 42 ug/ml ( P = 0.0091 , paired t-test ) , and galectin-3 at 100 ug/ml induced activation to an extent similar to that observed with the combination of phytohemagglutinin and PMA .
The activation was inhibited by lactose , suggesting that the action of galectin-3 is dependent on its lectin function .

respectively .
The lectin activity of galectin-3 was inbibited with the specific saccharide lactose at 25 mmol/L .
The data represent means % SD of triplicate measurements .
Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments .
tin-3 was not dependent on concurrent activation by PMA .
No additional activation was observed when Jurkat cells were treated with both galectin-3 and PMA ( data not shown ) .
Galectin-3 was not mitogenic to responder CTLL-2 cells at concentrations tested for the activation of Jurkat E6-1 cells .
This suggests that the responses observed in the CTLL-2 cells did not result from soluble galectin-3 transferred with medium from the Jurkat cells cultured with the lectin .
Discussion We concluded from this study that HTLV-I infection of T cells leads to a marked increase in galectin-3 gene expression resulting from transactivation by the viral Tax protein .
The results obtained with the mutant Tax expression vectors allowed us to conclude that the activation of the galectin-3 gene by the Tax protein independently involves primarily the CREB/ATF and , to a lesser extent , the NF- « B/Rel transcription factor pathways .
Inspection of the 5'-flanking sequence of murine galectin-3 genomic DNA , which we previously cloned , `` in fact revealed a number of potential enhancer elements quite similar to CREB/ATF and NF- « B/Rel binding sites ( Figure 4 ) .
CREB/ATF alone appears to constitute full activity when compared HTLV-I Infection Induces Galectin-3 Expression in T Lymphocytes - 1667 with the Tax wild-type expression vector , suggesting a major role for this transcription factor pathway .
It is also possible that an additional pathway is recruited by CREB/ATF for activation of the galectin-3 promoter .
Lower activation of the galectin-3 promoter by NF- « B/Re !
suggests that this pathway may be of lesser significance .
Our finding that up-regulation of galectin-3 expression occurs in HTLV-l-infected T cells convincingly demonstrates that the expression of this protein can be influenced by viral infection .
Of interest is the previous observation by Moutsatsos et that 3T3 cells transformed with the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus expressed much higher levels of galectin-3 when compared with uninfected cells .
Induction of galectin-3 expression by viral influence is likely to be significant because existing information on galectin-3 suggests that expression of galectin-3 in some cells may in fact contribute to the transformed phenotype in tumor cells .
It has been reported that transfection of 3T3 fibroblasts with galectin-3 cDNA resulted in cells exhibiting morphology of transformed cells , is , loss of contact inhibition , anchorage-inde-pendent growth in agar , and disruption of structural microfilament organization . ``
'' In addition , fibrosar-coma cells transfected with the galectin-3 cDNA , and thus expressing elevated levels of this lectin , showed a significantly enhanced ability to colonize in lungs of mice infused with these cells , suggesting that this lectin is capable of conferring the metastatic phenotype . ``
Galectin-3 expression may be closely related to cell growth .
Increased fevels of this lectin are found in proliferating fibroblasts , and the protein shows prominent nuclear localization in proliferating cells . ``
As infection with HTLV-I leads to spontaneous proliferation of T cells , `` it is possible that elevated expression of galectin-3 may be linked to this proftifer-ative response .
A possible mechanism by which cells are induced to proliferate by galectin-3 is by autocrine stimulation of susceptible receptors on the cell surface .
Although no conventional signal sequence is present in cDNA coding for galectin-3 , secretion has been demonstrated from a variety of cell types , © and it would be expected that the lectin would be secreted from T cells in a similar manner .
Galectin-3 is capable of activating monocytes/mac-rophages , `` `` mast cells , `` `` and neutrophils by interacting with cell surface glycoproteins . ``
This study now demonstrates that galectin-3 is also capable of activating T lymphocytes .
As a factor able to participate in autocrine stimulation in T cells , galectin-3 may be compared to the up-regulation of IL-2/IL-2 receptor by Tax® `` as early events contributing to cell AJP May 1996 , Vol .

5 proliferation resulting from HTLV-I infection.° `` ©2 In fact , we have recently observed in gene transfection experiments that galectin-3 expression in leukemic T cells results in an enhanced rate of cell growth ( R.-Y .
Yang , D. K. Hsu , and F.-T. Liu , manuscript submit-ted ) .
The beneficial roles of galectin-3 to tumor cell growth suggests that expression of this lectin may indeed contribute to pathogenesis in individuals infected with HTLV-I .
Significantly , the finding that up-regulation of galectin-3 expression may occur through CREB/ATF and NF- « B/Ret transcription factor pathways , or alternatively through activation of a secondary pathway resulting from activation of the above , provides insights into how expression of this member of the novel multifunctional animal lectins might be regu-lated .
This information also suggests possible fac-tors/conditions that lead to the induction of this protein .
Other viruses may up-regulate galectin-3 , as many viral transactivating factors are known to activate the NF- « B/Re !
pathway . ``
In addition , NF- « B/ Rel was proposed to be a signal transducer in the immediate early phases of immune responses , `` and it can be induced by various stimuli , including ultraviolet radiation®® `` and oxidative processes . ``
'' Thus , it is possible that galectin expression is influenced under these conditions .
In summary , this study allowed identification of mechanisms by which galectin-3 expression is regulated and thus provided a basis for further delineation of regulatory mechanisms for expression of this lectin in various other cell types .
The study also yielded new information on HTLV-I infection .
Additional studies of the function of galectin-3 in HTLV-I-infected T lymphocytes , including the identification of cell surface glycoconjugate ligands , may provide important insights into the pathogenesis of HTLV-I infection .
