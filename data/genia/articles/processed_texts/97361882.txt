We have examined the effect of cytokines on IL-2 deprivation-induced apoptosis of human antigen-specific T helper clones with different cytokine production profiles .
We found that IL-2 , interferon-alpha ( IFN-a ) , and IFN- $ inhibited IL-2 deprivation apoptosis in ThO , Th1 , and Th2 clones .
We also found that IL-2 protects T cell clones from IL-2 deprivation apoptosis accompanying active proliferation and enhanced expression of P53 , Rb and Bel-xL proteins .
In contrast , IFN- « /8 rescued T cell clones from apoptosis without active proliferation , and expression of apoptosis-associated proteins tested so far was unaffected .
This may be due to the fact that T cells treated with IL-2 contained those located in S + G ; /M phases of the cell cycle , whereas the vast majority of T cells treated with IFN- @ w/B were located in Gy/G ; phase .
specifically induced tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation into nucleus of signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) 2 protein in the T cell clones .
In addition , over-expression of STAT2 by transfection of the cDNA prevented apoptosis of the T cell clones .
Our present study shows that IFN-a and -8 mediate anti-apoptotic effect through other pathways than that of IL-2 in growth factor deprivation apoptosis .
Keywords INTRODUCTION Apoptosis constitutes a systemic means of cell suicide within an organism during normal morphogenesis , tissue remodelling , and in response to pathogenic infections or other irreparable cell damage [ 1-4 ] .
Several biochemical events that contribute to apoptosis have recently been elucidated .
Genetic evidence in nematodes , for example , has identified both positive and negative regulators of apoptosis [ 5 ] .
It has been shown that the key pro-apoptotic genes are mammalian IL-1 { §-converting enzyme ( ICE ) and apopain , members of a new family of cysteine proteases [ 6,7 ] .
Furthermore , the pro-apoptotic effects of ICE and apopain could be prevented by cell-death suppressor gene , the proto-oncogene , product Bel-2 .
The fate of eukaryotic cells may therefore reside in the balance between the opposing pro-apoptotic effects of an ICE/apopain-like protease [ 6,7 ] and an upstream regulatory mechanism involving Bel-2 and/ or its homologues [ 8 , 9 ] .
In addition to Bel-2 , its homologues , such as Bcl-x , Bax , Bak , and Bad [ 8,9 ] , proto-oncogene products such Correspondence : Dr Sakae Kaneko , Department of Dermatology , Hiroshima University School of Medicine , 1-2-3 Kaeumi , Minami-ku , Hiroshima 734 , Japan .
© 1997 Blackwell Science human antigen-specific T cell clone apoptosis STAT as c-Myc and anti-oncogenes Rb and P53 , also exert positive and negative influences on the apoptotic cell death of eukaryocytes [ 3,10 ] .
However , precise roles and mechanisms of these apoptosis-associated gene products for controlling apoptotic cell death remain to be fully understood [ 3,11 ] .
In particular , studies that address whether apoptotic cell death of human mature peripheral T lymphocytes is also controlled by these apoptosis-associated gene products are awaited .
Peripheral mature T lymphocytes undergo apoptotic death following either T cell receptor stimulation or a decrease in cytokine production after antigen clearance , in order to remove the large pool of antigen-specific effecter cells that could potentially contribute to excessive inflammatory reactions or autoimmune responses [ 12 ] .
Indeed , it has been shown that dysfunction of apoptosis in the immune system can lead to disease [ 4,13 ] .
T cells in patients with AIDS , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and other immunological disorders die rapidly by apoptosis .
Lymphocytopenia , especially CD4* T cell depletion , seen in patients with AIDS correlates well with their prognosis .
Thus , controlling apoptotic cell death would be a desirable means of treating such patients .
In this study , we examined effects of various cytokines on human T cell apoptosis using house dust mite ( HDM ) - and purified 185 186 S. Kaneko et al .
protein derivative ( PPD ) -specific T helper clones that were induced to undergo apoptosis by IL-2 deprivation .
We found that apoptosis in antigen-specific T helper ( Th ) 1 , Th2 and ThO cell clones induced by IL-2 withdrawal can be differently regulated by distinct cytokines , and interferon-alpha/beta ( IFN-w/68 ) have potent anti-apoptotic effects on all three types of clone .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents HDM ( Dermatophagoides farinae ) extract was kindly provided by Torii Pharmaceutical Co. ( Tokyo , Japan ) .
PPD was purchased from Japan BCG Co. ( Tokyo , Japan ) .
In preliminary experiments , we determined the optimal concentrations of HDM ( 10 ug/ml ! )
and PPD ( 1 pg/ml ! )
in the proliferation assays ( data not shown ) .
The following human cytokines were used in this study : rIL-2 ( Shionogi Pharmaceutical Corp. , Osaka , Japan ) , IFN- « , IFN-§ ( both from Mochida Pharmaceutical Corp. , Tokyo , Japan ) , and IFN-y ( Shionogi Pharmaceutical Corp. ) .
Establishment of antigen-specific T cell clones and their cytokine production pattern HDM-specific and PPD-specific T cell clones were established by a standard procedure using limiting dilution technique [ 14,15 ] .
In brief , HDM-specific clones were generated from an atopic patient who was allergic to HDM , and PPD-specific clones were generated from a healthy donor who was positive for PPD skin reaction .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were cultured with a relevant antigen for a week in culture media consisting of RPMI1640 , 10 % heat-inactivated pooled human AB serum , 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin ( Life Technolo-gies , Inc. , Gaithersburg , MD ) .
The activated T cells were cloned by limiting dilution at 0-3 cell/well and cultured with 5 % 10 `` irradiated autologous PBMC as feeder cells , the antigen and 4 ng/ml rIL-2 .
The T cell clones were maintained by repetitive stimulation with feeder cells and antigen once a week and 2 ng/ml of rIL-2 twice a week .
After confirmation of antigen specificity of the T cell clones by specific proliferative responses to HDM and PPD , they were used as antigen-specific T cell clones .
Cloned T cells that had been cultured for 7 days with the antigen and feeder cells were recovered and were used for the study .
All clones used in the present study expressed TCR « $ , CD3 , CD4 , CD45RO , but were negative for CD8 ( data not shown ) .
IL-4 and IFN-y levels of culture supernatants of the clones stimulated with the antigen and feeder cells for 16 h were measured using ELISA kits ( IL-4 : R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ; IFN-y : BioSource International Inc. , Camarillo , CA ) .
We assigned ThO , Th1 and Th2 as follows : Th1 clones that produce IFN-y but low levels of IL-4 pg/ml ) ; Th2 clones that produce IL-4 but undetectable IFN-y ( < 10pg/m ! )
; ThO clones that produce both IL-4 and IFN-y ( see Table 1 ) .
Proliferation assay In order to characterize proliferation of the clones , 5 x 10* T cells were cultured with 5 x 10 `` feeder cells and optimal concentrations of antigen , in the presence of various concentrations of cytokines for 3 days .
In some experiments , proliferation for 24 h of T cells in the presence of various cytokines without antigen or feeder cells was measured .
Proliferative response was estimated by incorporation of °H-TIR ( 1 uCi/well ; Amersham International , Aylesbury , UK ) during the last 16 h. Data shown are the mean ct/min of triplicate cultures , and s.e.m .
of the triplicate cultures never exceeded 15 % of the mean ( data not shown ) .
Cell viability and cell morphology Cell viability was determined by light microscopy after cell staining with trypan blue [ 16,17 ] .
For ultrastructural analysis , T cells were fixed with 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0-1 m phosphate buffer , post-fixed with 1 % osmium tetroxide , and embedded in Epon according to routine techniques .
Thin sections were mounted on nickel grids , stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and examined with an electron microscope [ 18 ] .
DNA staining with propidium iodide and TUNEL method Cellular DNA was stained with propidium iodide ( PID ) , and analysed by a flow cytometer [ 19 ] .
Briefly , after cell culture with cytokines , T cells were gently resuspended in hypotonic PI solution ( PI 50 pg/ml !
in 0-1 % sodium citrate plus 01 % Triton X-100 ) .
The samples were placed at 4°C in the dark overnight .
The PI fluorescence of isolated nuclei was measured with a FACScan and the percentage of apoptotic nuclei ( subdiploid DNA peak in the DNA fluorescence histogram ) was calculated using Consort 30 program .
Percent apoptotic cell death = ( subdiploid DNA ( A region ) subdiploid DNA ( A region ) + diploid DNA ( B region ) ) x 100 % .
We found that the variability of our apoptosis assay using PI staining ( s.e.m . )
never exceeded 10 % of the means of quadriplicate estimation ( data not shown ) .
To detect DNA strand breaks , that are intimately associated with an apoptotic response , an in sifu cell death detection kit ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) , where nicked DNA of fixed cells was labelled by the incorporation of fluores-ceine-conjugated dUTP at strand breaks by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase , was used [ 20 ] .
Immunoblotting analysis and antibodies To study expression of cytoplasmic proteins , T cell clones were lysed in 100 ul Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer [ 21 ] containing protease inhibitors ( 1 mg/ml PMSF , 5 mm EDTA , 2 mg/m !
aprotinin , and 2 mg/ml leupeptin ) .
In the experiments where protein tyrosine phosphorylation was studied , 400 mm NaVos , 5 mm EDTA and 10 mm NaF were included in the buffer .
To study translocation of signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) proteins , nuclear proteins of the T cells were recovered by the method of Dignam et a. , with minor modification [ 21,22 ] .
To reduce contamination of cytoplasmic proteins , the crude nuclei prepared by hypotonic solution were washed twice and nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspension of the nuclei in high salt buffer [ 22 ] .
Samples were electrophoresed on a 4-20 % polyacrylamide gel under reducing condition and the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes .
The membranes were incubated with the first antibody and biotin-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibody , followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin .
Detection was carried out using ECL kit ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Antibodies used in the present study were as follows : anti-Bel-2 ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) , anti-Bcl-x ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , anti-Bax ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti-P53 ( Dako ) , anti-c-Myc ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti-Rb ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti-STAT1 , anti-STAT2 , and anti-STAT3 ( the latter three from Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KT ) .

The transfected T cell clones were maintained in culture for 36 h. Thereafter , these clones were induced to die by growth factor deprivation apoptosis .
RESULTS Characterization of antigen-specific T cell clones T cell clones which had been cultured for 7 days after the last stimulation with feeder cells plus the antigen were recovered for use in apoptosis assays and proliferation assay .
Thereafter , T cell clones were cultured with the antigen and feeder cells in the presence of various cytokines for 3 days to characterize cytokine-dependent proliferation of antigen-specific T cell clones .
We found that IL-2 induced potent proliferation of Th1 , Th2 and ThO types .
In contrast , IFN- and rather inhibited antigen-specific proliferation of the clones tested ( Table 1 ) .
Induction of apoptotic cell death of antigen-specific T cell clones by IL-2 deprivation HDM-specific and PPD-specific CD4* T cell clones were harvested after 7 days culture with the antigen , feeder cells and IL-2 , and were cultured for 24 h in culture media alone to induce IL-2 deprivation apoptosis .
The extent of apoptotic cell death was estimated by the following methods : DNA staining with PI , the TUNEL method , ladder formation by DNA electrophoresis , and electron microscopic analysis .
As shown in Fig .
1a , most T cells cultured with 10 ng/ml of rIL-2 were viable , and only 5-4 % of T cells were found dead by DNA staining method with PI .
In contrast , T cells cultured with culture medium rapidly died by apoptosis ( dead cells : 622 % ) .
In addition , anti-FAS antibody , induced apoptosis of the clones ( dead cells : 925 % ) .
This finding is further confirmed by ladder formation of DNA recovered from T cells cultured for 24h with culture media , a sample of apoptotic cell death ( data not shown ) .
The results of cell staining with a TUNEL method ( Fig .
1b ) and those of viable cell staining with trypan blue were consistent with the above findings .
After 24h incubation in culture medium , 21 % of the originally seeded antigen-specific T cell clones were viable , and addition of rIL-2 to the T cell clones significantly improved recovery of viable cells ( viability : 98 % ) by trypan blue staining .
The apoptotic nature of IL-2 deprivation-induced cell death of T cell clones was further confirmed by electron microscopic examination ; T cells cultured without IL-2 ( medium ) showed typical features of apoptotic cells : reduced cell volume , condensed Table 2 .

Inhibition of IL-2 deprivation-induced apoptotic cell death by cytokines We next studied whether cytokines prevent apoptotic cell death induced by IL-2 deprivation of human antigen-specific T cell clones .
T cell clones died by apoptosis when cultured with culture medium , and supplementation of IL-2 rescued the T cell clones from apoptotic death ( Fig .
la ) .
To our surprise , introduction of into the cell culture also prevented apoptotic cell death induced by IL-2 deprivation ( Fig .
1a ) .
The inhibitory effects of IFN- @ /B on IL-2 deprivation apoptosis were dose-dependent ( Fig .
2 ) .
As a next step , we tested whether the cytokines ( IL-2 , IFN- , IFN-8 , and IFN-y ) inhibited apoptotic cell death induced by IL-2 deprivation of other HDM-specific and PPD-specific T cell clones ( Table 2 ) .
The T cell clones were recovered , and cultured for 24h with various cytokines in the absence of feeder cells and antigen .
Significant inhibition ( > 20 % ) of IL-2 deprivation-induced apoptosis was observed in all clones tested , including ThO , Th1 and Th2-type T helper clones when IL-2 , IFN- @ , and IFN-§ were introduced into the cultures ( Table 2 ) .
Growth stimulatory activity of cytokines that inhibit IL-2 deprivation-induced apoptosis It is important to know whether inhibition of IL-2 deprivation apoptosis accompanies active cell proliferation .
To this end , T cell clones were cultured with the cytokine in the absence of the feeder cells and the antigen .
Thereafter , proliferation induced at the end of 24-h cell culture was estimated .
Potent proliferation of the T cell clones was yielded in response to IL-2 ( proliferation of T cells with IL-2 at time 24 h , 92.000 ct/min ) .
It is intriguing that inhibited IL-2 deprivation-induced apoptosis , but did not induce active proliferation of T cell clones ( those with IFN- at time 24 h , 5000 ct/min , and those without cytokines at time 24 h , 2000 ct/ min ) .
This finding is further confirmed by DNA staining analysis shown in Fig .
1a .
The T cells treated with IL-2 contained those that were located in S+G/M phases of cell cycle , whereas the vast majority of T cells treated with were located in phase .
Essentially the same results were obtained using ThO , Th1 , and Th2 clones ( data not shown ) .
Our results suggest that anti-apoptotic cytokines may be classified into two types : one that rescues from apoptosis with accompanying active proliferation of the cells , the other that protects T cells from apoptotic cell death without proliferation .
Expression of apoptosis-associated proteins in antigen-specific T cell clones rescued by cytokine supplementation The precise roles and mechanisms of apoptosis-associated gene products , such as Bel-2 , Bax , Bel-x , P53 , c-Myc and Rb , for controlling apoptotic cell death remain to be fully understood in human antigen-specific T cell clones [ 3,11 ] .
Using immunoblotting analysis , we examined apoptosis-associated proteins of the T cell clones that were induced to die by IL-2 deprivation apoptosis .
T cell clones were cultured in culture medium for 24h to induce apoptosis .
Supplementation of IL-2 into the cell cultures rescued the T cell clones from apoptosis .
Expression of P53 , Rb , and Bel-xL proteins was significantly up-regulated during culture of rescued clones ( Fig .

Analysis of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cytoplasm of the T cell clone rescued by IL-2 and IFN-8 .
Cytoplasmic proteins were recovered from the T cell clones rescued from apoptosis by IFN- $ or IL-2 .
Immunoblotting was carried out using anti-phosphotyrosine MoAb .
Similar results were obtained in at least three experiments .
An open triangle indicates 85-kD protein , a closed triangle 91-kD protein , and two closed triangles 110-kD protein .
Bel-2 and Bax was unchanged during the 24 h culture period .
To our surprise , none of the apoptosis-associated proteins examined in this study were affected significantly during rescue by treatment .
This finding may be associated with the fact that IFN-treated T cells locate in the Go/G ; phase of the cell cycle ( Fig .
5 ) .
It is intriguing that c-Myc and Bel-xS proteins were never detected in CD4* T cell clones we have tested ( Fig .
3 ) .
Nonetheless , a T cell line , Jurkat , expressed abundant c-Myc and Bcel-xS proteins .
These results suggest that IL-2 protects T cell clones from IL-2 deprivation-induced apoptosis using a pathway in which P53 , Rb and Bel-xL protein expression is up-regulated .

Analysis of STAT proteins in the T cell clones rescued from apoptosis by IL-2 and IFN-§ .
T cell clones were cultured to induce apoptosis in culture medium or in the presence of IFN-8 ( 10 000 IFN-y ( 1000 U/ml ) or IL-2 ( 10 ng/ml ) .
After cell culture , cytoplasmic proteins and nuclear proteins of the T cells were separately recovered .
Translocation of STAT2 in human T cell clones was evident in the T cell clone treated with IFN-8 .
accompanies active cell proliferation .
In contrast , IFN- @ /f rescues T cell clones from IL-2 deprivation-induced apoptosis without accompanying active cell proliferation .
Thus , it is possible that mediate anti-apoptotic effect through a pathway distinct from that of IL-2 .

The T cell clones were cultured to induce IL-2-deprivation apoptosis with or without IFN- « /f , and protein tyrosine phosphorylation of the T cells was examined .
As shown in Fig .
4 , IFN-8 stimulation and IL-2 stimulation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in HDM-specific human T cell clones .
Of note is the fact that tyrosine phosphorylation of 91-kD protein was evident in both and IL-2-stimulated T cells with a similar kinetics ( 1-30 min ) .
However , a 110-kD protein was specifically tyrosine phosphorylated in the T cells , at time 15-60 min .
IL-2-treated T cells contained a tyrosine phosphorylated 85-kD protein specifically at time 1-30 min .
It has been shown that IFN-w/6 pathway utilizes STAT1a ( 91 kD ) , STAT1Ib ( 84 kD ) and STAT2 ( 110 kD ) to transduce the relevant signal to the nucleus [ 24-26 ] .
Thus , the 91- and 110-kD proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated in the T cells rescued from apoptosis by IFN- « /f treatment were likely to be STAT1a and STAT2 , respectively .
Stimulation by IL-2 of the T cell clones induced the 85- and 91-kD proteins .
It has been reported that IL-2 signalling utilizes STAT3 ( 89 kD , minor form 84 kD ) and STATS ( 92 kD ) [ 24,27,28 ] .
Thus , it is possible that the 85- and 91-kD proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated in the IL-2-treated T cell clones represent STAT3 and STATS5 , respectively .
IFN-B , but not IL-2 nor IFN-y , induces translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus of STAT It has been shown that Janus kinases/Just another kinases ( JAKs ) and STATs in the cytoplasm are involved in the signal transduction pathway of IFN- @ /8 [ 24 ] , and STAT2 protein is translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus after treatment of cells with IFN- @ /8 [ 26,29 ] .
As a next step , we examined whether STAT2 protein translocates from cytoplasm into nucleus of antigen-specific human T cell clones rescued with IFN- @ / $ treatment .
As shown in Fig .
5 , we detected accumulation of STAT2 protein in the nuclei of human T cell clones after treatment for 1 h with IFN-6 .
This accumulation of STAT2 protein in the nuclei was specific for IFN- , because such i n m 1 | | | | | 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 Percent apoptosis Fig .

Effects of STAT2 cDNA transfection on the apoptosis of T cell clones .
T cell clones were transfected as described in Materials and Methods , and induced to die via growth factor deprivation apoptosis .
Apoptotic cell death was measured by flow cytometric analysis of DNA stained with propidium iodide ( PI ) .
The result shown is a representative of three independent experiments using KMC253 T cell clone , and essentially the same results were obtained in two independent experiments with KMC146 T cell clone .

accumulation was not detected in the nuclear proteins of T cell clones treated with IFN-y or IL-2 .
These results suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect by IFN-8 in antigen-specific T cell clones may be mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2 in the cytoplasm and translocation into nucleus .
To confirm the involvement of STAT2 protein in the anti-apoptotic activity of IFN-w/B , we examined whether STAT2 overexpression by DNA transfection confers resistance to growth factor deprivation apoptosis .
T cell clones were transfected with empty pME18S vector or vector containing STAT2 cDNA .
The levels of STAT2 protein expression were analysed by Western blotting analysis ( data not shown ) ; transfectants with empty vector did not have detectable level of STAT2 protein in the cytoplasm , whereas transfectants with pME18S containing STAT2 cDNA expressed high levels of STAT2 protein by Western blotting analysis .
The transfectants were cultured for 36h to induce STAT2 protein overexpression .
Thereafter , T cell clones were recovered , counted and were recultured to induce growth factor deprivation apoptosis .
As shown in Fig .
6 , T cell clones transfected with STAT2 expression vector were rather refractory to growth factor deprivation apoptosis .
These data strongly suggest that a signalling pathway involving STAT2 protein is causally associated with prevention of apoptosis in human T cell clones .
DISCUSSION Growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis in vitro may represent a situation in vivo in which cytokine production is diminished after antigen clearance , leading to the removal of a large , potentially harmful , pool of antigen-specific effecter T cells [ 12,30 ] .
Rescue from this apoptosis of T cells may be associated with development of immunological memory [ 31,32 ] .
It is generally believed that maintenance of memory depends on persistence of antigen [ 31 ] .
We found that promotes the survival of antigen-specific T cells otherwise destined to die by apoptosis in the absence of antigen without accompanying active cell proliferation .
Thus , we propose that cytokines such as IFN-w/B may be important for the development and/or maintenance of memory T cells , since characteristics of IFN- « @ /B-treated T cells , that do not die or proliferate actively , may resemble those of memory T cells in resting status [ 32,33 ] .
In accordance with our findings , it has recently been reported that IFN-w/§ may be involved in the maintenance of memory T cells [ 33 ] .
In addition , IFN- has been shown to inhibit apoptotic cell death of B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells cultured in vitro without growth factors [ 34 ] .
It has already been reported that addition of fibroblasts to IL-2-dependent T cells results in prolonged survival of the T cells in the absence of proliferation , suggesting a salvage pathway whereby activated T cells reverted to non-proliferating cells in the absence of antigen or mitogenic signals [ 35 ] .
Our finding that treatment rescues T cells from growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis without accompanying proliferation at least partly coincides with these findings [ 35 ] .
Thus , it is possible that IFN-w/B secreted by fibroblasts induce prolonged survival of once activated T cells .
Treatment with of MOLT16 cells induces augmented apoptosis upon phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) activation [ 36 ] .
MOLT16 cells represent prethymic T cells of T cell differentiation pathway .
In contrast , our T cell clones represent circulating mature CD4* T cells with antigen specificity .
It has already been reported that T-B interaction inhibits spontaneous apoptosis of mature peripheral T cells , but not immature double-positive thymocytes in Bcl-2-deficient mice [ 36,37 ] .
We have confirmed the anti-apoptotic effects of IFN- @ / $ 8 on more than 12 T cell clones , two PHA-activated human T cell lines , and two PPD-specific T cell lines .
Thus , it is possible that IFN- « @ / $ , or the same cytokines exert different effects on apoptosis of T cells , depending on the T cell differentiation stages .
Dysregulated apoptosis is associated with lymphocyte depletion in human diseases such as AIDS , SLE , and other immunological disorders [ 4,13,30 ] .
In particular , the decline of circulating CD4 T cells is an important clinical feature and prognostic factor of patients with AIDS [ 38-40 ] .
Thus , control of apoptosis is an important potential target for therapeutic intervention .
It has been shown that IFN- « treatment induced a 20 % increase in the CD4*~ T cell percentage in patients with AIDS [ 41 ] .
We believe that our present study gives a rationale for clinical use of IFNs to treat AIDS patients suffering from circulating CD4 * T cell depletion .
It has been shown that Bel-2 acts as an important regulator in an apoptotic pathway .
It has been shown that IFN- @ /6B up-regulate Bcl-2 expression and protect B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells from apoptosis [ 42 ] .
It has also been reported that Bel-2 protein and its mRNA expression are up-regulated by treatment of T cells with IL-2 and related cytokines [ 43 ] .
However , we found that IL-2 had no effect on Bel-2 protein expression of T cell clones in this study .
One possible explanation of this difference is that we measured Bcl-2 expression at a relatively early time point ( 24 h ) , perhaps before Bel-2 had a chance to drop .
They measured Bel-2 expression at a relatively late time point .
Another possibility is that our T cell clones were selected on the basis of growth advantage ( or resistance to cell death ) in the in vitro culture , that may have association with high Bcl-2 expression .
Thus , our clones may not exhibit further enhancement of Bel-2 expression in response to IL-2 .
Our antigen-specific T cells rescued by treatment showed stable expression of Bel-2 protein and other apoptosis-associated proteins , and they located in Gy/G phase of cell cycle .
STATs are central mediators of cytokine-induced transcriptional activation [ 42 ] .
It has been shown that induce , through activation of JAK family kinases , the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 [ 24 ] .
Thus , it is highly likely that STAT2 induced specifically by treatment transduces anti-apoptotic signals to the nucleus of responding T cells [ 26 ] .
Indeed , we have confirmed the involvement of STAT2 in the anti-apoptotic effects of by Western blotting and DNA transfection analysis .
Thus it is possible that IFN-w/f constitute an alternative pathway that induces transcription of unknown gene ( s ) which is associated with inhibition of apoptotic cell death of T cells , and that anti-metabolic effects of IFN- @ w/8 are responsible for the inhibition of apoptosis .
Thus , it it intriguing to test whether other types of T cell inhibitors such as retinoids [ 44 ] or transforming growth factor-beta ( TGE-§ ) [ 45 ] inhibit the process of apoptotic death of T cell clones .
Further efforts are needed to clarify the mechanisms of growth factor deprivation apoptosis and the anti-apoptotic pathway utilized by IFN- @ / $ .
