TAL1 and LIM-Only Proteins Synergistically Induce Retinaldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 Expression in T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia by Acting as Cofactors for GATA3 YUICHI ONO , `` NORIO anp OSAMU YOSHIE* `` * Shionogi Institute for Medical Science , Settsu-shi , Osaka 566-0022 , `` and Department of Bacteriology , Kinki University School of Medicine , Osaka-Sayama , Osaka 589-8511 , *° Japan Received 6 July 1998/Returned for modification 4 August 1998/Accepted 1 September 1998 Previously , we have shown that TALI and the LIM-only protein gene ( LMO ) are regularly coactivated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) .
This observation is likely to relate to the findings that TAL1 and LMO are highly synergistic in T-cell tumorigenesis in double-transgenic mice .
To understand the molecular mechanisms of functional synergy between TAL1 and LMO in tumorigenesis and transcriptional regulation , we tried to identify downstream target genes regulated by TAL ] and LMO by a subtractive PCR method .
One of the isolated genes , that for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( RALDH2 ) , was regularly expressed in most of the T-ALL cell lines that coexpressed TAL ] and LMO .
Exogenously transfected TAL1 and LMO , but not either alone , induced RA4LDH2 expression in a T-ALL cell line , HPB-ALL , not expressing endogeneous TAL1 or LMO .
The RALDH2 transcripts in T-ALL were , however , mostly initiated within the second intron .
Promoter analysis revealed that a GATA site in a cryptic promoter in the second intron was essential and sufficient for the TAL1-and LMO-dependent transcriptional activation , and GATA3 binds to this site .
In addition , forced expression of GATA3 potentiated the induction of R4LDH2 by TAL1 and LMO , and these three factors formed a complex in vivo .
Furthermore , a TAL1 mutant not binding to DNA also activated the transcription of RALDH2 in the presence of LMO and GATA3 .
Collectively , we have identified the RALDH2 gene as a first example of direct transcriptional target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL .
In this case , TAL1 and LMO act as cofactors for GATA3 to activate the transcription of RALDH2 .
In various types of leukemia , specific recurrent chromosomal translocations are frequently observed and potential oncogenic transcription factors have been identified from the chromosomal breakpoints ( 46 ) .
These transcription factors are mostly involved in normal hematopoietic cell differentiation and growth .
In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) , frequent chromosomal abnormalities are found in the TAL ] ( also called SCL or TCL3 ) locus ( 5 , 9 , 10 , 14 ) .
Ectopic expression of TAL1 , which is not normally expressed in T cells ( 44 , 57 ) , is observed in ~60 % of T-ALL patients ( 4 ) .
TALI encodes at least two alternative isoforms , full-length TAL1 « and N-terminally truncated TAL1B , having a basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ] ) motif found in a number of transcription factors involved in the regulation of cell differentiation ( 6 ) .
TAL1 dimer-izes with ubiquitous bHLH E-proteins ( E47 , E12 , and HEB ) ( 20 , 22 ) , and the heterodimers bind to the E-box motif ( CANNTG ) , most preferably to AACAGATGGT ( 21 ) .
However , no downstream target genes have been identified .
It is thus uncertain whether TAL1-E-protein heterodimers regulate transcription through binding to this preferred E-box .
LMO1 ( RBTN1 or TTG1 ) and LMO2 ( RBTN2 or TTG2 ) are also genes originally identified from recurrent chromosomal breakpoints in T-ALL ( 7 , 34 , 49 ) .
Their expression in T-ALL is ectopic , like that of TAL ] ( 15 , 18 , 35 , 49 ) .
They encode highly related LIM-only class proteins ( LMO ) , which consist of only two tandemly repeated LIM domains .
The LIM domain is a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif present in certain homeodomain transcription factors and some kinases and cytoskeletal * Corresponding author .

6939 proteins , and it appears to mediate protein-protein interactions ( 45 , 51 ) .
LMO are nuclear proteins ( 35 , 61 ) and are considered to be involved in transcriptional regulation , even though they do not have DNA binding activity .
Targeted-disruption experiments revealed that both TALI and LMO2 are essential for embryogenesis , as mutant mice die at embryonic day 9.5 due to the absence of yolk sac erythropoiesis ( 48 , 52 , 61 ) .
Since TAL1 and LMO2 physically associate in the erythroid cell lineage ( 56 , 59 ) , these transcription factors are likely to regulate erythroid cell differentiation and growth by forming a complex .
Previously we have shown that TALI is regularly coexpressed with LMO1 or LMO2 in T-ALL ( 41 ) .
Furthermore , transgenic mice ectopically expressing TAL1 in T cells did not efficiently develop tumors ( 13 , 27 , 47 ) , whereas double-transgenic mice expressing TAL1 and LMO rapidly developed leukemia ( 2 , 30 ) .
These results suggest that not only in the regulation of erythroid cell differentiation but also in the development of T-ALL , TAL1 and LMO act synergistically , most probably by forming a complex ( 30 ) .
However , no downstream target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO have been identified .
Thus , the molecular mechanism by which these factors regulate transcription in the erythroid lineage and T-ALL remains mostly unknown .
The fact that chromosomal abnormalities involving TALI and LMO are highly restricted to T-ALL suggests that some other T-cell-specific cofactor ( s ) is involved in the oncogenic function of TAL1 and LMO ( 41 ) .
In the erythroid lineage , LMO2 physically interacts with GATA1 as well as TAL1 and bridges these factors to form a larger complex in vivo ( 42 ) .
GATA1 was first identified as a protein binding to the conserved regulatory elements among many erythroid cell-specific genes ( 55 ) .

tion of erythroid precursors ( 16 , 43 ) , implying that TAL1 , LMO2 , and GATA1 cooperatively regulate transcription in the erythroid lineage .
Although GATA1 is not expressed in the T-cell lineage , another member of the GATA-binding protein family , GATA3 , is expressed ( 19 , 28 , 33 ) .
We have shown that GATA3 physically interacts with LMO in vitro and is a potent cofactor for TAL1 and LMO in transactivation of an artificial reporter gene in a T-ALL cell line ( 41 ) .
To understand the mechanism of T-cell tumorigenesis and transcriptional regulation by TAL1 and LMO , we have been focusing on downstream target genes of these factors .
Previously , we have shown that the gene for a T-ALL-specific tumor marker , TALLA1 ( 54 ) , is likely to be one such gene .
TALLA ] T is regularly coexpressed with TALI and LMO in T-ALL cell lines ( 41 ) .
Coexpression of exogeneous TAL1 and LMO1 , but not either alone , strongly induced TA4LLA ] in a T-ALL cell line , HPB-ALL , not expressing endogeneous TAL1 or LMO ( 41 ) .
However , the mechanism of induction of by TAL1 and LMO remains unknown .
In this study , we show that the gene for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( RALDH2 ) ( 63 ) is also induced in HPB-ALL cells by coexpression of exogeneous TAL1 and LMO and that RA4LDH2 is regularly expressed in most T-ALL-derived cell lines ectopically coexpressing TAL1 and LMO .
Promoter analysis revealed that a transcriptional complex containing TAL1 , LMO , and GATA3 binds to a GATA site in a cryptic promoter in the second intron of the RALDH2 gene and regulates transcription through this site .
Thus , the RALDH2 gene is a direct target gene regulated by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL , and in this case TAL1 and LMO act as cofactors for GATA3 .

RESULTS RALDH ] 2 is induced by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL .
To identify target genes regulated by ectopically coexpressed TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL , we used a T-ALL-derived cell line , HPB-ALL , not expressing TAL1 or LMO and its subline stably expressing transfected TAL1a « and LMO1 ( 41 ) .
Using suppression-subtractive hybridization followed by two cycles of subtractive PCR ( see Materials and Methods ) , we obtained several fragments of genes whose expression was strongly up-regulated in the subline coexpressing TAL1 « and LMO1 ( data not shown ) .
Four of these fragments were derived from the same gene .
Since the encoded amino acid sequence is 98 % identical to mouse RALDH2 ( 63 ) , this gene is the human counterpart of the RALDH2 gene ( see below ) .
To examine the roles of TAL1 « and LMO1 in the induction of RALDH2 , we analyzed the expression of RALDH2 in a panel of HPB-ALL clones stably expressing transfected TAL1a « or LMO1 or both ( 41 ) .
As shown in Fig .
1A , the vector control clones and those expressing either TAL1a or LMO1 alone did not express RALDH2 at all , whereas those coexpressing both TAL1a « and LMO1 strongly expressed it .
To rule out possible clonal variations , we also examined HPB-ALL cells transiently transfected with TAL1 and LMO expression vectors ( Fig .
1B ) .
Consistent with the results obtained with stable clones , only HPB-ALL cells cotransfected with TALla « and LMO1 expressed RALDH2 .
Furthermore , even the N-terminally truncated isoform TAL1B induced RALDH2 expression in the presence of LMO1 or LMO2 .
These results strongly suggest that RALDH2 is a transcriptional downstream target gene of TAL1 and LMO and that both TAL1 and LMO are required for induction of RALDH2 .
To examine whether expression of RALDH2 is regularly associated with ectopic expression of TALI and LMO in T-ALL , we performed Northern blot analysis of 13 T-ALL cell lines ( 54 ) .
As shown in Fig .
1C , HPB-ALL , DND4.1 , and TALL-1 cells , which express neither TAL ] nor LMO ( 41 ) , did not express RALDH2 either .
In contrast , except for Molt15 and Molt17 , all of the T-ALL cell lines that co-express TALI and either LMO1 or LMO2 ( 41 ) also expressed RALDH2 .
Although Molt15 and Molt17 cells , which were the only T-ALL cell lines with the CD4~_ CD8~ double-negative phenotype ( 54 ) , did not express RALDH2 despite coexpression of TAL ] and LMO2 , these results strongly support the idea that RALDH2 is indeed induced by coactivation of TALI and LMO in the majority of T-ALL .
Among other hematopoietic cell lines tested , K562 , which is an erythroleukemia-derived cell line endogenously expressing TALI and LMO2 , also expressed RALDH2 ( Fig .
1D ) .

obtained from Molt4 and K562 cells .
The coding sequence of cDNA obtained from K562 cells showed a striking homology to the mouse RALDH2 gene , and the deduced amino acid sequence was 98 % identical to that of mouse RALDH2 .
In contrast , the 5 portion of cDNA obtained from Molt4 cells was 237 bp shorter than that of K562 cells , and the 5'-terminal 28-bp sequence was not present in the K562 cDNA .
Analysis of the genomic sequence of RALDH2 revealed that the 28-bp sequence was derived from the second intron .
All of the clones obtained from Molt4 cells by the S'RACE method contained the same short 5 ' portion , suggesting that transcription was initiated from a cryptic promoter within the second intron of the RALDH2 gene in Moltd4 cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
This was further confirmed by primer extension analysis and RNase protection assay ( data not shown ) .
These analyses also revealed that there were several transcriptional initiation sites within ~30 bp around the boundary between the second intron and third exon of the RALDH2 gene .
To test which types of message were transcribed in other T-ALL cell lines , RALDH2 transcription was examined by RT-PCR with primer sets specific for the full-length type ( F1-R1 ) , the 5'-truncated type ( F2-R1 ) , or both ( F3-R1 ) ( Fig .
2B ) .
As expected , K562 cells expressed only the full-length type .
In contrast , although some full-length type messages were also detected in Molt4 and SALT12 cells , the major transcripts in T-ALL-derived cell lines were of the truncated type .
Furthermore , HPB-ALL clones stably expressing transfected TAL1a and LMO1 also expressed only the truncated-type mRNA ( Fig .
2B ) .
These results suggest that ectopic expression of TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL induces transcription mostly if not exclusively from the intronic promoter of the RALDH2 gene .
Furthermore , this alternatively initiated type of mRNA was not detected in normal human tissues ( data not shown ) , suggesting that this type of mRNA is highly specific for T-ALL .
The first AUG codon of T-ALL-specific mRNA is in the same frame of the full-length RALDH2 mRNA , suggesting that the former encodes an N-terminally truncated protein .
To examine this , we performed in vitro translation experiments .
As shown in Fig .
2C , 56 and 46-kDa proteins were translated from the full-length mRNA and the T-ALL-specific mRNA , respectively .
This suggests that the N-terminally truncated 46-kDa protein is produced in T-ALL cells .
We thus designated this N-terminally truncated form RALDH2-T ( T-ALL type ) .
A GATA site in the RALDH2-T promoter is required for induction by TAL1 and LMO .
To understand the mechanism of regulation of the RALDH2-T promoter by TAL1 and LMO ( Fig .
3A ) , we constructed a luciferase reporter gene containing the 1.7-kb genomic fragment upstream of the first ATG codon of RALDH2-T ( -1.7-luc [ see Fig .
4A ] ) and transfected it with or without TAL1 and LMO into HPB-ALL cells .
As shown in Fig .
3B , either TAL1 or LMO alone did not induce the transcription from the reporter .
However , TAL1 and LMO1 or LMO2 transactivated the reporter 18- and 8-fold , respectively .
TAL1la and TAL1B had similar activities in this assay .
These results were in accordance with the induction of the endogeneous RALDH2-T in HPB-ALL cells by TAL1 and LMO , suggesting that the 1.7-kb genomic fragment contains a regulatory element ( s ) responsible for the induction of RALDH2-T by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL .
As shown in Fig .
3A , a TATA box-like sequence is not seen in the promoter region , but the major initiation site matches the consensus initiator ( Inr ) sequence ( 24 ) .
There are an E-box ( CAGGTG ) known to be recognized by TAL1-E2A heterodimers ( 60 ) at position -273 ( ATG is +1 ) and a consensus GATA site ( AGATAA ) ( 29 , 37 ) at position -239 .

Induction of the RALDH2-T promoter by TAL1 and LMO .
( A ) Nucleotide sequence around the promoter region of RALDH2-T. Exon sequences are boxed .
A consensus GATA site , an optimal E-box , and the putative initiation codon of RALDH2-T are underlined .
Major transcriptional initiation sites are indicated by arrows .
( B ) HPB-ALL cells were cotransfected with 20 ug of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 1.7-kb genomic fragment of the RALDH2-T promoter ( -1.7-luc ) , 0.1 pg of pRL-CMV for normalization of transfection efficiency , and 5 pg each of expression plasmids without inserts ( - ) or with the indicated inserts .
Relative luciferase activity compared to that of the reporter plasmid alone was determined .
Means and standard deviations for three independent experiments are shown .
moter , we constructed a series of 5 ' deletion mutants and examined activation of these reporters by TAL1 « and LMO1 in HPB-ALL cells ( Fig .
4A ) .
Unexpectedly , deletion of the E-box did not affect the response ( compare -308-luc with -267-luc ) .
Mutation of the E-box also had little effect on the transcription from the reporter ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , the deletion removing 3 bases in the GATA site abrogated the induction of the reporter by TAL1 « and LMO1 ( compare -231-luc with -228-luc ) .
Further deletions to position -142 ( ~50 bp upstream of transcription start sites ) and the deletion downstream of the start site had little further effect ( Fig .
4A and data not shown ) .
To specifically address the role of the GATA site at position -239 , this element was changed to a restriction site ( -1.7GM-luc [ Fig .
4BJ ) .
The mutation of the GATA site effectively abrogated the response .
These results clearly indicate that the GATA site at position -239 in the RALDH2-T promoter is essential for induction by TAL1 and LMO .
INDUCTION OF RALDH2 BY TALl AND LMO IN T-ALL - 6943 GATA3 is involved in induction of R4LDH2-T by TAL1 and LMO .
Next , we examined the binding of nuclear proteins to the GATA site in the RALDH2-T promoter .
Nuclear extracts were prepared from HPB-ALL cells and used for EMSA .
As shown in Fig .
5A , binding to the GATA site was observed .
This binding was competed out by a 200-fold excess of the same cold oligonucleotide but not by the same amount of the mutant oligonucleotide corresponding to the sequence of the GATA mutant reporter ( -1.7GM-luc [ Fig .
4B ] ) , suggesting that the binding was specific for the GATA site .
The binding was also competed out by the T-cell receptor alpha ( TCRa ) GATA site , suggesting that the binding protein is a GATA-binding protein family member .
Among six members identified in the GATA-binding protein family , only GATA3 is known to be expressed in the T-cell lineage ( 19 , 28 , 33 ) .
Thus , we used an anti-GATA3 MAb for supershift experiments .
The anti-GATA3 MAb indeed supershifted the binding complex ( Fig .
5A ) , indicating that the binding protein is GATA3 .
The same shift band was observed even with nuclear extracts from an HPB-ALL clone stably expressing TALla and LMO1 , suggesting that TAL1a and LMO1 did not directly bind to this site and that the binding of GATA3 to this site was not appreciably enhanced by TAL1a « and LMO1 ( data not shown ) .
Next we examined whether overexpression of GATA3 could affect the activation of the RALDH2-T promoter by TAL1 and LMO .
As shown in Fig .
5E , overexpression of GATA3 alone in HPB-ALL cells did not enhance -1.7-luc reporter expression .
However , its induction by TAL1 « and LMO was further up-regulated by overexpression of GATA3 , especially with the combination of TAL1 « and LMO2 .
Furthermore , a dominant negative GATA3 ( KRR ) ( 53 ) effectively suppressed induction of the reporter by TAL1a « and LMO .
These results strongly support the idea that GATA3 is involved in the induction of the RALDH2-T promoter by TAL1 and LMO .
This was further confirmed by the same transfection assays with a B-ALL-derived cell line , BALL-1 ( 54 ) ( Fig .
5F ) .
We confirmed by RT-PCR that BALL-1 cells did not express TAL1 , LMO1 , LMO2 , or GATA3 ( data not shown ) .
In this cell line , the -1.7-luc reporter gene was not activated even by cotransfection of TAL1la « and LMO .
GATA3 alone had no effect either .
However , cotransfection of GATA3 , TAL1la , and LMO activated the reporter by ~20-fold .
This further supports the idea that GATA3 is involved in the transactivation of the RALDH2-T promoter by TAL1 and LMO .
These results led us to examine the physical interactions between TAL1 , LMO , and GATA3 .
TAL1 had been reported to interact with LMO in vivo ( 56 , 59 ) .
This was also confirmed by our experiments ( see Fig .
6B ) .
FLAG-tagged GATA3 and HA-tagged LMO1 or LMO2 were transiently expressed in 293E cells .
As shown in Fig .
5C , HA-LMO1 as well as HA-LMO2 was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-GATA3 from the cell lysates by an anti-FLAG MAb , suggesting that both LMO1 and LMO2 were capable of binding to GATA3 in vivo .
On the other hand , direct interaction between TAL1B and GATA3 was not observed ( Fig .
5D ) .
However , in the presence of LMO2 , HA-TAL1B was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-GATA3 , suggesting that LMO2 is capable of bridging TAL1 and GATA3 to form a complex in vivo ( Fig .
5D ) .
Collectively , these observations strongly suggest that a complex consisting of TAL1 , LMO , and GATA3 is formed in T-ALL cells and that the complex induces transcription from the RALDH2-T promoter .
DNA binding activity of GATA3 is required for transactivation of the RALDH2-T promoter .
Thus far , we have shown that a GATA site in the RALDH2-T promoter is essential for the induction by TAL1 and LMO and that GATA3 acts in collab- 6944 ONO ET AL .

Requirement of a GATA site but not an E-box in the RALDH2-T promoter for induction by TAL1 and LMO .
( A ) HPB-ALL cells were cotransfected with one of the indicated RALDH2-T reporter plasmids and expression vectors for TAL1 « and LMO1 .
The results show fold activation in luciferase activity from the reporter alone .
Means and standard deviations for three independent experiments are shown .
( B ) Mutations introduced in -1.7GM-luc .
oration with TAL1 and LMO .
Therefore , we next tested whether the DNA binding activity of GATA3 was necessary for induction of the RALDH2-T promoter .
For this purpose , we constructed a GATA3 mutant lacking the DNA binding activity .
In the case of GATA1 , the C-terminal Zn finger is required for DNA binding activity , and a mutant with cysteines in this region changed to glycines could not bind to DNA but still interacted with other transcription factors , such as SP1 ( 38 ) .
Like this GATA1 mutant , the C-terminal Zn finger of GATA3 was mutated to generate GATA3-CFM .
Whole-cell lysates of COS cells transiently expressing FLAG-GATA3 or FLAG-GATA3-CFM were used for EMSA to test the DNA binding activity .
As shown in Fig .
5B , FLAG-GATA3 bound to the GATA site of the TCRa enhancer region ( 19 ) and was supershifted by the anti-FLAG MAb .
On the other hand , FLAG-GATA3-CFM could not bind to the same oligonucleotide even though proteins were detected by Western blotting .
It was also demonstrated that GATA3-CFM interacted with LMO2 in vivo by coprecipitation assays ( Fig .
5C ) .
These results confirmed that GATA3-CFM could form a complex with TAL1 and LMO but could not bind to DNA .
After these experiments , we tested whether GATA3-CFM was capable of activating the RALDH2-T promoter in collaboration with TAL1 and LMO .
When GATA3-CFM was transfected with TAL1a and LMO , it did not enhance the transcription from the reporter -1.7-lue in HPB-ALL cells or induce the transcription in BALL-1 cells ( Fig .
5E and F ) .
Thus , the DNA binding activity of GATA3 is necessary for the transactivation of the RALDH2-T promoter by the complex containing GATA3 , TAL1 , and LMO .
The DNA binding activity of TAL1 is dispensable for induction of RALDH2-T. Next we tested whether the DNA binding activity of TAL1 is required for activation of the RALDH2-T promoter .
The basic region of bHLH-type transcription factors is known to be the DNA binding domain ( 8 , 11 ) .
Therefore , we mutated three amino acids , in the basic region , RRR , which are highly conserved in various bHLH proteins ( 40 ) , to ala-nines ( AAA ) and designated this mutant TAL1B-BM ( for basic region mutant ) .
To test whether TAL1B-BM could still interact with E47 , a partner of the heterodimer , or with LMO , coprecipitation experiments were performed .
As shown in Fig .
6A , HA-tagged E47S was coprecipitated with FLAG-TAL1fB-BM as well as with wild-type FLAG-TAL1B .
HA-tagged LMO2 was also coprecipitated with FLAG-TAL1B-BM , although the interaction appeared to be weaker than that of LMO2 and wild-type TAL1f ( Fig .
6B ) .
These results confirmed that TAL1BBM was still capable of binding to E47 and LMO2 .
Next we examined the DNA binding activity of TAL1B-BM .
As shown in Fig .
6C , binding to the consensus E-box ( 21 ) by the lysate of 293E cells expressing both FLAG-TAL1B and HA-E47S was observed .
This binding was inhibited by addition of anti-FLAG MAb , confirming that the complex contained FLAG-TAL1f .
The binding was competed out by addition of the cold E-box oligonucleotide but not by the cold GATA site oligonucleo-tide , confirming that the TAL1-E47 heterodimer was capable of binding to the consensus E-box but not to the GATA site in the RALDH2-T promoter .
In contrast , no specific binding by the lysate of 293E cells expressing FLAG-TAL1B-BM and HA-EATS was observed , even though the protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting .
These results indicated that TAL1B-BM was capable of forming a heterodimer with EA47S but that the resulting dimer did not efficiently bind to DNA .
After these experiments , we examined whether TAL1B-BM was still capable of inducing the RALDH2-T promoter in collaboration with LMO and GATA3 .
As shown in Fig .
6D , TAL1B-BM induced the transcription from the RALDHZ-T Vou .

Simi-larly , TAL1B-BM in the presence of LMO and GATA3 activated the transcription by ~10-fold in BALL-1 cells , as TAL1B did ( Fig .

Furthermore , transiently expressed TAL1B-BM and LMO induced the expression of endogeneous RALDH2 in HPB-ALL cells ( Fig .

These results clearly demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of TAL1 , in contrast to that of GATA3 , is not necessary for the activation of the RALDH2-T promoter .
Thus , TAL1 acts as a cofactor for GATA3 in the induction of the RALDH2-T promoter .
TAL1 , LMO , and GATA3 activate transcription through the GATA site .
To further demonstrate that the GATA site in the RALDH2-T promoter was sufficient for the induction of transcription by the combination of TAL1 , LMO , and GATA3 , it was tandemly repeated three times and linked to a heterolo-gous HSV # k minimal promoter ( 36 ) , making GATAX3-tk-luc .
This reporter plasmid was cotransfected into BALL-1 cells with various combinations of expression plasmids for TAL1B , LMO1 , GATA3 , and their mutants .
As shown in Fig .
7 , although parental tk-luec weakly responded to the combination of TAL1B , LMO1 , and GATA3 , GATAX3-tk-lue was further activated by ~7-fold , indicating that the combination of TAL1f , LMO1 , and GATA3 was indeed capable of activating the transcription through the GATA site alone .
As the case of -1.7-luc , the transcription from GATAX3-tk-lue was activated even by TAL1B-BM in collaboration with LMO1 and GATA3 but not by GATA3-CFM even in the presence of TAL1B and LMO1 .
These results further demonstrate that TAL1 and LMO induce the transcription of the RALDH2-T promoter through the GATA site at position -239 by acting as cofactors for GATA3 .
INDUCTION OF RALDH2 BY TALl AND LMO IN T-ALL - 6947 DISCUSSION We have identified the RALDH2 gene as a transcriptional target gene for TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL .
RALDH2 was strongly induced in HPB-ALL cells upon stable as well as transient coexpression of TAL1 and LMO .
Most T-ALL-derived cell lines that ectopically coexpress TAL ] and LMO also express RALDH2 .
A T-ALL-specific alternative promoter present in the second intron of the RALDH2Z gene , termed the RALDH2-T promoter , was transactivated by TAL1 and LMO through binding of a TALI-LMO-GATA3 complex to a GATA site in the RALDH2-T promoter .
These results strongly suggest that the RALDH2 gene is a first direct downstream gene for the abberantly activated transcription factors TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL .
Functional synergy between TAL1 and LMO .
Targeted disruption of either TAL ] or LMO2 resulted in embryonic lethal-ity by the absence of yolk sac erythropoiesis ( 48 , 52 , 61 ) .
In erythroid cells , TAL1 and LMO2 are coexpressed and are thought to regulate erythropoiesis by forming a oligomeric complex with GATA1 , Ldb1 , and EZA ( 60 ) .
TAL1 and LMO are also synergistic in T-cell tumorigenesis in double-transgenic mice ( 2 , 30 ) .
This suggests that a complex consisting of TAL1 and LMO also plays an important role in the development of T-cell leukemia .
In the present study , we have shown that both TAL1 and LMO are required for abberant expression of RALDH2-T in T-ALL ( Fig .
1 and 3 ) .
Although the role of RALDH2-T in the development of T-ALL is unknown ( see below ) , complex formation between TAL1 and LMO is likely to be important in the regulation of expression of target genes involved in tumorigenesis .
The roles of LMO1 and LMO2 in normal development are thought to be different , since these genes are expressed in different tissues ( 15 , 18 , 35 , 49 ) .
In fact , LMO2 but not LMOI is coexpressed with TAL ] in the hematopoietic lineage ( 56 ) .
The structures of LMO1 and LMO2 are , however , very similar , and both are capable of interacting with TAL1 and GATA proteins in vivo ( Fig .
5C ) ( 42 , 56 , 59 ) .
Both are capable of inducing RALDH2 in collaboration with TAL1 ( Fig .
1 and 3 ) .
Previously , we have shown that TAL ] is regularly coexpressed with either LMO1 or LMO2 in most T-ALL cell lines ( 41 ) .
These results suggest that LMO1 and LMO2 are both capable of playing a similar role in T-ALL oncogenesis .
Since target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO2 in erythroid cells have not been identified , their transcriptional activity has not been clarified .
However , by using erythroid pre-cursor-derived cell lines , TAL1 and LMO2 were both shown to maintain erythroid cells in an immature state and promote self-renewal ( 17 , 58 ) .
Thus , the complex of TAL1 and LMO may promote expression of genes involved in cell growth in the erythroid cell lineage .
This may relate closely to their roles in T-cell tumorigenesis .
Mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the RALDH2-T promoter by TAL1 and LMO .
When we identified RALDH2-T as a target gene induced by TAL1 , we expected that an E-box in the promoter region of RALDH2-T was an important element ( Fig .
3A ) .
However , the results obtained by transient-transfection experiments using a series of reporter genes with deletions and point mutations clearly demonstrated that a GATA site at position -239 but not an E-box at position -273 was necessary for the induction by TAL1 and LMO ( Fig .
4 ) .
Our data further showed that GATA3 was capable of binding to the GATA site ( Fig .
5A ) and was involved in the transactivation by TAL1 and LMO ( Fig .
5E and F ) .
The combination of TAL1 , LMO , and GATA3 activated the transcription even from an artificial reporter gene linked to three tandem repeats 6948 ONO ET AL .

Model of transcriptional activation of the RALDH2-T promoter by TAL1 , LMO , and GATA3 .
In normal T cells , GATA3 binds to the GATA site in the RALDH2-T promoter but does not activate transcription .
When TAL1 and LMO are ectopically expressed in T-ALL , a large complex containing TAL1 , LMO , and GATA3 is formed on the GATA site in the RALDH2-T promoter to activate transcription from a downstream initiator ( Int ) ( see Discussion ) .
of the GATA site ( Fig .
7 ) , suggesting that the GATA site alone is sufficient for transactivation by TAL1 and LMO in the presence of GATA3 .
The observations that the TAL1-E47 heterodimer did not bind to the GATA site ( Fig .
6C ) and that TAL1B-BM lacking the DNA binding activity was still capable of inducing RALDH2-T like the wild-type TAL1B in the presence of LMO and GATA3 ( Fig .
6D to F ) further indicate that the direct binding of TAL1 to the promoter is not required .
Together with the fact that the LMO family proteins are thought to have no DNA binding activity , this indicates that both TAL1 and LMO appear to act as cofactors for GATA3 .
As illustrated in Fig .
8 , GATA3 is likely to bind to the GATA site in the RALDH2-T promoter region in normal T cells .
Importantly , however , GATA3 alone does not activate transcription from the RALDH2-T promoter .
Only when TAL1 and LMO are ectopically coexpressed in T-ALL , a large transcriptional complex containing TAL1 , LMO , and GATA3 that is capable of activating the RALDH2-T promoter is formed .
Thus , GATA3 may act as a DNA-binding platform for LMO and TAL1 ( Fig .
8 ) .
Why are both TAL1 and LMO required for the induction of RALDH2-T expression in T cells ?
LMO can interact with GATA3 in the absence of TAL1 in vivo ( Fig .
5C ) , but expression of LMO alone in HPB-ALL cells did not induce transcription from the RALDH2-T promoter ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , although it has been reported that LMO1 and LMO2 contain transactivation domains in the N termini ( 32 , 50 ) , LMO itself can not act as a coactivator for GATA3 .
The role of LMO in the induction of RALDH2-T expression may be to bridge TAL1 and GATA3 to form a complex .
Since TAL1 does not interact with GATA3 directly ( Fig .
5D ) , the TAL1-E47 heterodimer may act as a transcriptional coactivator for GATA3 only in the presence of LMO .
Various transcription factors are known to act synergistically with GATA family proteins .
For example , SP1 and EKLF regulate the globin gene locus control region with GATA1 ( 38 ) .
In the regulation of endothelin-1 gene expression in en-dothelial cells , GATAZ and AP1 act cooperatively ( 26 ) .
In these cases , GATA family proteins and other factors are known to cooperate by binding to respective binding sites in the regulatory regions .
However , when one of these sites is mutated , two factors are still capable of activating transcription Mor .

through the remaining site .
In other words , one factor which does not bind to DNA is still capable of collaborating with the other DNA-binding factors by acting as a cofactor .
Similar observations have been reported for bHLH-type transcription factors .
Myogenic factor MyoD and MADS box factor MEF2 cooperatively activate transcription through each binding site reciprocally ( 39 ) .
Notably , there is a potential E-box besides the GATA site in the RALDH2-T promoter ( Fig .
3 ) .
Deletion or mutation of this E-box , however , did not affect the induction by TAL1 and LMO ( Fig .
4 and data not shown ) .
Moreover , the existence of the E-box did not complement the mutation in the GATA site for transcriptional activation by TAL1 and LMO ( Fig .
4 ) .
Even in the presence of TAL1 and LMO , GATA3CFM lacking DNA binding activity could not transactivate the RALDH2-T promoter ( Fig .
5E and F ) , whereas a similar mutant , GATA1 disr.Cf , was still capable of acting as a cofactor for SP1 in the globin gene enhancer ( 38 ) .
Furthermore , the TAL1-LMO-GATA3 complex could not activate transcription through the three tandem repeats of the most preferred E-box element ( AACAGATGGT ) linked to tk-lue in BALL-1 cells ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that , in contrast to the other cases described above , the TAL1-LMO-GATA3 complex activates transcription from the RALDH2-T promoter only through the GATA site .
Why does GATA3 activate RALDH2-T transcription only by forming a complex with TAL1 and LMO ?
In the experiments using GATAX3-tk-lue in BALL-1 cells , only sevenfold activation was observed even though three tandem repeats of the element were used ( Fig .
7 ) .
This may suggest that other cis-acting elements in the RALDH2-T promoter are still involved in full induction by TAL1 , LMO , and GATA3 .
Preliminary data indeed revealed that the selective deletion of the 50-bp fragment downstream from the GATA site also decreased the induction of RA4LDH2-T as did the GATA site mutation ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that there is a downstream cis-acting element ( s ) that acts synergistically with the GATA site in the induction of RALDH2-T by the TAL1-LMO-GATA3 complex .
TAL1 and LMO may mediate synergism between GATA3 and an unknown factor ( s ) that binds to the downstream ele-ment ( s ) .
The TAL1-LMO-GATA3 complex in T-ALL may contain Ldb1 ( also called NL1 or CLIM2 ) ( 1 , 3 , 25 ) , like the TAL1-LMO2-GATA1 complex in erythroid cells ( 60 ) .
It was shown that Ldb1 was required for synergistic activation of the « GSU promoter by P-Lim and P-Otx ( 3 ) .
Thus , Ldb1 may play a role in cooperation between the TAL1-LMO-GATA3 complex and another factor ( s ) binding to the downstream regions of the RALDH2-T promoter in T-ALL .
As shown in Fig .
1C , Molt15 and Molt17 cells , which express TAL1 , LMO2 , and GATA3 ( 41 ) , did not express RALDH2-T .
Since these cell lines strongly express TALLAI ( 54 ) , which is also apparently induced by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL ( 41 ) , TAL1 and LMO2 are likely to be functional in these cell lines .
This also suggests that some factor ( s ) other than GATA3 and not expressed in Molt15 and Molt17 cells , which are the only CD4~ CD8~ double-negative lines among the T-ALL cell lines examined ( 54 ) , is involved in the transactivation of the RALDH2-T promoter .
Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of RALDH2-T induction in T-ALL .
Role of RALDH2-T in T-ALL .
RALDH2 was identified as an enzyme converting retinal to retinoic acid ( 63 ) .
In fact , RALDH2 is expressed in the trunk region of the developing embryo , where retinoic acid is produced ( 63 ) .
It has been shown that retinoic acid inhibits activation-induced apoptosis of T cells ( 23 , 62 ) .
One possibility is that ectopically expressed RALDH2-T inhibits apoptosis of T cells by generating retinoic acid .
To detect retinoic acid in T-ALL cell lines , we transfected Vou .
18 , 1998 INDUCTION OF RALDH2 BY TALl AND LMO IN T-ALL _ 6949 a luciferase reporter gene containing a retinoic acid response element ( 31 ) .
Even in the presence of retinal as a substrate , activation of the reporter was not observed ( data not shown ) .
One possibility is that the N-terminally truncated RALDH2-T protein may not have the enzymatic activity .
Alternatively , RALDH2-T may convert another substrate or act as a dominant negative factor for other enzymes .
The role of RALDH2-T in the development of T-ALL thus remains to be determined .
Besides its potential role in T-ALL , RALDH2-T may also provide a useful marker for diagnosis and monitoring of T-ALL , since this type of RALDH2 transcript could not be detected in normal tissues even by RT-PCR ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , the RALDH2-T promoter or its GATA site may be exploited for driving gene expression specifically in T-ALL for therapeutic purposes .
