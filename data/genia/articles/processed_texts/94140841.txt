G ( Anh ) MTetra , a Natural Bacterial Cell Wall Breakdown Product , Induces Interleukin-1 $ and Interleukin-6 Expression in Human Monocytes A STUDY OF THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE EXPRESSION* ( Received for publication , July 14 , 1993 , and in revised form , October 14 , 1993 ) Willem H.

However , most attention has been focused on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
We studied the ability of N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-N-acetyImuramyl-r-alanyl-v-isoglutamyl-m-diaminopime- Tetra ) , a naturally occurring breakdown product of peptidoglycan that is produced by soluble lytic transglycosylase of Escherichia coli , to induce cytokine expression in human monocytes .
G ( Anh ) MTetra was found to strongly induce interleukin ( IL ) -18 and IL-6 mRNA expression after 2 h and IL-1 8 and IL-6 protein secretion after 48 h of activation .
The increase in mRNA accumulation was at least partly due to an increase in the transcription rates of the respective genes and was accompanied by a strong induction of nuclear factor- « B and activator protein-1 transcription factor expression .
Experiments using inhibitors of protein kinase C , protein kinase A , and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways revealed that G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-1 $ and IL-6 mRNA expression involves activation of an H7-inhibitable pathway .
By using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide , it was shown that G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-6 mRNA expression depends on the synthesis of new protein , whereas G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-18 mRNA accumulation does not .
When responses to G ( Anh ) MTetra were compared with those to LPS and muramyldipeptide ( MDP ) , it was found that the optimal response to G ( Anh ) MTetra induction was similar to that of LPS but significantly higher than the response to MDP .
Furthermore , maximal G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-16 and IL-6 mRNA expression could be enhanced by co-stimulation with LPS or MDP , suggesting that different receptors and/or transduction pathways were involved .
These results indicate that Tetra induces IL-1 $ 6 and IL-6 expression in human monocytes suggesting a possible role for Tetra in the release of cytokines during sepsis .
Certain components of the bacterial cell wall are known to activate several blood cells like T-cells and monocytes .

Activation of monocytes by certain bacterial cell wall components has been shown to lead to the induction of inflammatory cytokines that are known to be important determinants of sepsis ( 2 ) .
Of the active cell wall components , the lipopolysaccharides ( LPS , endotoxins ) of Gram-negative bacteria have been the most extensively stud-ied .
LPS have been shown to be powerful inducers of the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 $ , 11-6 , and TNFa from human blood monocytes .
However , although LPS are likely to be a very important mediator of sepsis ( 3 ) , other factors must also be involved .
This is demonstrated by the fact that Gram-positive bacteria , which do not contain LPS in their cell walls , are also capable of causing septic shock ( 2 ) .
Furthermore , LPS-insensitive mice remain vulnerable to Gram-negative sepsis ( 4 ) .
Other bacterial cell wall components that have been shown to be inducers of cytokines and consequently might be important during the development of sepsis are the teichoic acids , lipoprotein , staphylococcal protein A and peptidoglycan ( 5-9 ) .
Peptidoglycan has long been recognized to possess immuno-stimulatory properties .
Although some studies on cytokine induction by soluble forms of peptidoglycan ( 10 ) have been re-ported , most attention has been focused on the synthetic muramylpeptide _ N-acetyl-muramyl-t-alanyl-v-isoglutamine ( MDP ) , the smallest common structural unit of adjuvant pep-tidoglycans ( 11 ) .
MDP and lipophilic MDP derivatives have been shown to induce the expression of IL-1 , IL-6 , G-CSF , M-CSF , PGE2 , TNFa , and IFN-y and have been reported to stimulate host defense activities against bacterial infections in vivo ( 12 ) .
Although MDP might be a very interesting tool for stimulating host defense , it is not a naturally occuring muramylpep-tide .
It is not a product of bacterial peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes nor has it been shown to be produced after phagocy-tosis by macrophages ( 13 , 14 ) .
Therefore , the results of these studies do not indicate a physiological role of peptidoglycan breakdown products in the induction of expression of inflammatory cytokines during the development of sepsis .
To study the ability of peptidoglycan breakdown products of bacteria during infection and to induce cytokine expression , we analyzed the response of human monocytes to exposure to a disaccharide-tetrapeptide : N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro- ' The abbreviations used are : LPS , lipopolysaccharide ( s ) ; G ( Anh ) MTetra , N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-v-isoglutamyl-m-diaminopimelyl-v-alanine ; IL , interleukin ; MDP , mur-amyldipeptide ; CHX , cycloheximide ; kb , kilobase ( s ) ; AP-1 , activator protein-1 ; NF-IL6 , nuclear factor IL-6 ; NK- « B , nuclear factor- « B .
4201 4202 alanine Tetra ) .
G ( Anh ) MTetra is structurally similar to the muramylpeptides produced by lysozyme but possesses an internal 1,6-anhydro bond within the muramic acid residue ( 15 , 16 ) .
It is produced by the soluble lytic transglycosylases of Escherichia coli ( 15 , 17 ) and also has been shown to be released during normal growth by Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( 18 , 19 ) .
Furthermore , G ( Anh ) MTetra has been shown to be identical to tracheal cytotoxin of Bordetella pertussis ( 20 ) and to the uri-nary-sleep inducing factor ( 21-23 ) .
Interestingly , the 1,6-anhydro structure of Tetra greatly enhanced potency for promoting slow wave sleep in rabbits ( 24 ) .
Since Dinarello and Krueger ( 25 ) demonstrated that Tetra induces IL-1 expression in human mononuclear cells in vitro , it is believed that some activities of G ( Anh ) MTetra are mediated through IL-1 .
However , up to now it has been difficult to obtain quantities of G ( Anh ) MTetra large enough to study its effect on he-matopoietic cells in detail ( 22 , 23 ) .
To obtain large amounts of G ( Anh ) MTetra , we made use of a recently described method for large scale purification of G { ( Anh ) MTetra , using immobilized murein hydrolases from £ .
coli fused to staphylococcal protein A ( 16 ) .
Our results demonstrate that Tetra strongly induces IL-18 and IL-6 mRNA expression in human monocytes .
The extent of induction of IL-18 and IL-6 mRNA by G ( Anh ) MTetra and by LPS was similar but significantly stronger than by MDP .
The data suggest a possible role for Tetra in the development of sepsis .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Preparation of Cells-Peripheral blood cells were obtained from volunteer platelet donors , and mononuclear cell suspensions were prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation .
T lymphocytes were removed by 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide-treated sheep red blood cell rosetting .
Monocytes were further enriched by plastic adherence ( 1 h , 37 °C ) to a purity > 95 % , as detected by fluores-cence-activated cell sorting analysis with CD-14 ( Beckton-Dickinson , Sunnyville , CA ) .
Monocytes were cultured at a density of 1-2 x 10 % /ml in RPMI 1640 media ( Flow , Rockville , MD ) with 10 % fetal calf serum , supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin , 100 pg/ml streptomycin , 2 mm L-glutamine , and 6 ng/ml colistin .
Isolation of G ( Anh ) MTetra-G ( Anh ) MTetra was enzymatically prepared by using immobilized murein hydrolases from E. coli fused to staphylococcal protein A as described ( 16 ) .

Tetra was free of endotoxin as measured by a chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate assay as described ( 26 ) .
Purity of the preparation was determined using high pressure liquid chromatography analysis as described ( 16 ) and was 90 % .
The other 10 % consisted of 1,6-anhydro-muramyl peptides with a different peptide moiety ( 16 ) .
The concentration was determined using amino acid analysis after acid hydrolyzation and ortho-phtaldialdehyde derivatization on a Hewlett Packard analyzer .
Stimulation-Before activation , cells were kept in the described medium for 16 h. Subsequently , cells were treated for various time periods with 1.25 ug/ml G ( Anh ) MTetra .
H7 ( Calbiochem ) was used at 50 um , H8 ( Calbiochem ) was used at 1.2 um , genistein ( Sigma ) was used at 20 ug/ml ( 27 , 28 ) , and cycloheximide ( CHX ; Sigma ) was used at 10 ug/ml .
LPS ( E. coli , serotype 055 : B5 ) and MDP were purchased from Sigma .
Polyclonal anti-serum against IL-1a and IL-18 ( gift from Dr. S. Gillis , Immunex , Seattle , WA ) was used at a dilution of 1:1000 .
These concentrations completely neutralize the activity of IL-la and IL-18 ( 200 units/ml ) tested in in vitro culture assay .
mRNA Extraction and Analysis-Total cellular RNA was isolated , and IL-18 and IL-6 mRNA levels were analyzed by Northern analysis as described ( 29 ) by using a 0.3-kb *°P-labeled IL-6 cDNA probe ( 30 ) ( gift from Dr. L. Aarden , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) or a 0.6-kb IL-1B cDNA probe ( gift from Dr. S. Gillis ) .
Quantification of mRNA levels was performed by densitometric scanning using a Gel Scan laser densitom-eter ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. ) .
IL-6 and IL-1B Secretion-1 x 10° monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum during 48 h or in medium in the presence of G ( Anh ) MTetra ( 1.25 ug/ml ) during 48 h. After the culture period , supernatants were analyzed for IL-6 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( 31 ) .

The detection limit of this assay is 2 pg/ml .
The Student 's t test for paired samples was used to determine the significance of the secretion data .
Run-on Transcription Assay-The run-on analysis was performed as previously described ( 32 ) using pooled nuclei of 3 donors .
Cells were treated with medium ( control ) or 1.25 ug/ml G ( Anh ) MTetra for 1 or 2 h. Five ug of the following DNAs were immobilized on Hybond N+ membranes ( 33 ) : 1 ) EcoRI linearized pGEM ( negative control ) ; 2 ) EcoRI linearized plasmid containing a 0.3-kb fragment of the human IL-6 cDNA ; 3 ) EcoRI linearized plasmid containing a 0.57-kb fragment of the human IL-18 cDNA ; 4 ) EcoRI linearized plasmid containing a 7.8-kb insert of the human 28 S DNA fragment .
Hybridization of labeled RNAs to these membranes was performed as described previously ( 32 ) .
Nuclear Extract Preparation-After stimulation for various time periods nuclear extracts were prepared according to a miniscale procedure as described ( 34 ) .
Nuclear extracts were divided in small aliquots , frozen in liquid NJ , and stored at ~80 °C .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay-The probes used in the gel retardation assays were constructed by hybridization of two 20-mers resulting in a NF- « B-like recognition site ( underlined ) that is present in both the IL-18 and IL-6 promoter regions ( 35 , 36 ) : 5'-AGCTGCGGG-GATTTTCCCTG-3 ' and 3'-CGCCCCTAAAAGGGACCTAG-5 ' or by 19-mers spanning the AP-1 consensus target sequence ( 37 , 38 ) .
Probes were labeled , and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described using 9 ng of nuclear extract/reaction ( 38 ) .
The same batches of proteins and labeled oligonucleotides were used in the reactions presented in the figures .
Competition experiments were performed by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled self- or nonself-probes before preincubation on ice .
RESULTS G ( Anh ) MTetra Induces IL-1B and IL-6 mRNA Expression in Human Monocytes-To determine whether Tetra induces and IL-6 mRNA expression in human monocytes , cells were treated either with culture medium ( control ) or with medium plus 0.5 ug/ml G ( Anh ) MTetra for 2 , 4 , 8 , and 15 h. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern analysis .
As shown in Fig .

Maximal induction of IL-1B and IL-6 mRNA was observed at a dose of 1.25 ug/ml G ( Anh ) MTetra .
To achieve maximal expression of both genes in further experiments , monocytes were activated with 1.25 ug/ml Tetra .
G ( Anh ) MTetra Induces Secretion of IL-1B and IL-6 Protein-To study the ability of G ( Anh ) MTetra to induce IL-18 and IL-6 protein expression we determined IL-1 $ and IL-6 secretion levels in supernatants of human monocytes that were cultured for 48 h in medium ( control ) or medium plus Tetra .
Very low levels of IL-18 ( 83.4 pg/ml + 46.8 ; mean + S.D .
, n = 5 ) and IL-6 ( 71.0 pg/ml + 35.8 ; mean + S.D .

Protein levels were significantly ( p < 0.005 ) increased to 773.6 pg/ml + 271.6 ( mean + S.D .
, n = 5 ) for IL-1B and to 847.0 pg/ml + 310.5 ( mean + S.D .

This indicates that Tetra also induces IL-18 and IL-6 protein expression in human monocytes , and it underscores the relevance of the mRNA data .

Nuclear extracts were prepared from control monocytes and from monocytes that were treated with 1.25 ug/ml G ( Anh ) MTetra for 15 , 30 , 60 , and 120 min .
Extracts were incubated with **P-labeled oligonucleotides containing an AP-1 and NF-kB target sequence .
After incubation , the mixtures were separated by electrophoresis .
Competition experiments were performed with a 100-fold molar excess of nonlabeled self- and nonself-oligonucleo-tides using the extracts that were isolated after 60 min .
An excess of free probe was used in every experiment but is only shown for NF-kB .
Duplicate experiments with other batches showed similar results .

Signal Transduction Pathways and Protein Synthesis Dependence of G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-1B and IL-6 mRNA Expres-sion-To assess the involvement of signal transduction pathways during G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-1B and IL-6 mRNA expression , we pretreated monocytes with the protein kinase A inhibitor H8 , with H7 , as well as with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein , before stimulation with Tetra .
H8 and genistein showed no effect .
In contrast , H7 blocked G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-1 $ 8 and IL-6 mRNA expression ( Fig .

monocytes were incubated with CHX , G ( Anh ) M Tetra , and with CHX plus Tetra .
CHX blocked the ability of G ( Anh ) MTetra to induce IL-6 mRNA expression , indicating that this induction depends on the synthesis of new protein ( Fig .

In contrast , monocytes exposed to CHX only , superinduced levels of IL-16 mRNA , which could be further augmented by exposure to G ( Anh ) MTetra , indicating that protein synthesis is not required for G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-18 mRNA expression .
Magnitude of IL-6 and IL-1B mRNA Expression Induced by G ( Ank ) MTetra , LPS , and MDP-To study the relative amount of IL-6 and IL-16B mRNA that is induced by G ( Anh ) MTetra , mRNA levels were compared with those induced by LPS and G ( Anh ) MTetra Induces IL-1B and IL-6 Expression MDP .
Maximal IL-6 and IL-1B mRNA was expressed at 0.5 ug/ml LPS and 5 ug/ml MDP ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , monocytes were treated with 1.25 ug/ml G ( Anh ) MTetra , 0.5 ug/ml LPS , and 5 ug/ml MDP .
Total RNA was extracted after 2 h of treatment , and RNA was subjected to Northern analysis .
As demonstrated in Fig .

50 0 4205 DISCUSSION In the present study we investigated whether G ( Anh ) MTetra , which is a naturally occurring 1,6-anhydro breakdown product of bacterial peptidoglycan ( 16 ) , can modulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes .
The results demonstrate that G ( Anh ) MTetra induces IL-18 and IL-6 mRNA expression .
This expression is mediated through an H7-inhibitable pathway that might include a protein kinase C-dependent pathway , which was previously described to be the most important transduction pathway mediating LPS responses in human monocytes ( 41 ) .
Although the Tetra used in these experiments is highly defined , it contains approximately 10 % of other 1,6-anhydro-muramyl peptides , which may also be biologically active ( 16 ) .
G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-18B and IL-6 expression was accompanied by an increase in the transcription rates of the respective genes .
It can not be excluded that post-transcriptional mechanisms , like stabilization of cytokine transcripts , also account for the strong induction of IL-1 and IL-6 mRNA by Tetra .
For example , for IL-18 mRNA expression it was shown that the half-life of LPS-induced IL-1B mRNA was 4 versus 2.5 h for adherence-induced IL-18 mRNA ( 42 ) .
One of the elements that is likely to play a role in post-transcriptional control of IL-18B mRNA expression is an unidentified labile protein .
This is supported by studies demonstrating an increased stability of IL-18B mRNA in the presence of CHX ( 43 , 44 ) .
The increase in IL-6 message may significantly be ascribed to stabilization of IL-6 transcripts , because a slight increase in the transcription rate was observed .
Therefore , it is likely that post-transcriptional control is the most prominent level of control for IL-6 mRNA expression upon stimulation with Tetra as was demonstrated earlier for LPS- versus IFN-y plus LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA ( 45 ) .
The effect of Tetra on IL-18 mRNA expression represented modification of preexisting proteins rather than new synthesis , because pretreatment with CHX did not abolish the effect .
In contrast , G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-6 mRNA expression is dependent on protein synthesis .
For IL-1 $ , these results are in accordance with data suggesting that NF- « B is the most dominant factor controlling transcription ( 43 , 46 ) .
NF- « B exists in an inactive cytoplasmic form that dissociates on phospho-rylation of the inhibitory protein termed IxB ( 47 , 48 ) .
Phospho- C =ILs =IL-18 £ £ £ ® @ ® i - A [ ad 3 3 o =¢€ ~ om al mal < ‘ Eo E0 < < < G 6 foJ 4206 rylation of IxB and the subsequent release of active NF- « B from the cytoplasm can occur in the absence of newly synthesized protein .
Most studies reported so far described NF- « B as the most important factor controlling IL-6 transcription ( 49-52 ) .
However , CHX plus G ( Anh ) MTetra induces without inducing IL-6 mRNA expression , indicating that additional factors are involved .
Possibly , the strong increase in AP-1 expression upon G { ( Anh ) MTetra treatment plays a role in the induction of the IL-6 transcription rate .
Supporting this sug-gestion , it was described that AP-1 mediates the increase in the transcription rate of the IL-6 gene in human T lymphocytes upon stimulation with pokeweed mitogen ( 53 ) .
Further experiments are needed to exactly define the transcription factors that control G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-186 and IL-6 expression and to rule out the possibility that other factors bind to the oligos we used .
Optimal expression of G ( Anh ) MTetra-induced IL-1 $ and IL-6 mRNA expression could be further enhanced by costimulation with optimal doses of LPS or MDP .
This finding suggests that different receptors and/or additional intracellular transduction pathways are involved .
The involvement of different receptors for LPS , Tetra , and MDP is underscored by the findings of Dziarski ( 54 , 55 ) who observed that neither MDP nor Tetra competed for LPS binding sites on murine macrophages .
Recently , it was suggested that MDP and LPS responses of murine monocytes were mediated through binding to different receptors ( 56 ) .
The role of G ( Anh ) MTetra in the development of sepsis is hypothetical .
However , the strong and relatively quick induction of two inflammatory cytokines in monocytes after exposure to Tetra is suggestive .
Apart from a possible role in the development of Gram-negative sepsis , Tetra might be a factor responsible for sepsis caused by Gram-positive bacteria .
As the action of the soluble lytic transglycosylases are thought to be triggered by certain antibiotics that are directed against cell wall metabolism ( 57 ) , application of these antibiotics may stimulate cytokine expression by the release of G ( Anb ) MTetra .
To test these hypotheses , it would be useful to examine a monoclonal raised against the 1,6-anhydro bond of G ( Anh ) MTetra , for its ability to inhibit cytokine expression in human monocytes treated with extracts of Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria .
