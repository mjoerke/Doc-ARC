Introduction Constitutively Activated Akt-1 Is Vital for the Survival of Human Monocyte-differentiated Macrophages : Role of Mcl-1 , Independent of Nuclear Factor ( NF ) -KB , Bad , or Caspase Activation Hongtao Liu , Harris Perlman , Lisa J. Pagliari , and Richard M. Pope Division of Rheumatology , Department of Medicine , Northwestern University Medical School , and the VA Chicago Health Care System , Lakeside Division , Chicago , IL 60611 Abstract Recent data from mice deficient for phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 or src homology 2 domain-containing 5 inositol phosphatase , phosphatases that negatively regulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway , revealed an increased number of macrophages in these animals , suggesting an essential role for the PI3K pathway for macrophage survival .
Here , we focused on the role of the PI3K-regulated serine/threonine kinase Akt-1 in modulating macrophage survival .
Akt-1 was constitutively activated in human macrophages and addition of the PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 , suppressed the activation of Akt-1 and induced cell death .
Furthermore , suppression of Akt-1 by inhibition of PI3K or a dominant negative ( DN ) Akt-1 resulted in loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential , activation of caspases-9 and -3 , and DNA fragmentation .
The effects of PI3K inhibition were reversed by the ectopic expression of constitutively activated Akt-1 or Bcl-x .
Inhibition of PI3K/Akt-1 pathway either by LY294002 or DN Akt-1 had no effect on the constitutive or inducible activation of nuclear factor ( NF ) -KB in human macrophages .
However , after inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway , a marked decrease in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Mcl-1 , but not other Bcl-2 family members was observed , and Mcl-1 rescued macrophages from LY 294002-induced cell death .
Further , inhibition of Mcl-1 by antisense oligonucleotides , also resulted in macrophage apoptosis .
Thus , our findings demonstrate that the constitutive activation of Akt-1 regulates macrophage survival through Mcl-1 , which is independent of caspases , NF-KB , or Bad .
Key words : - cell death * apoptosis * PI3K * dominant negative Akt-1 « mitochondrial transmembrane potential Macrophages are critical in the pathogenesis of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis ( 1 ) , atherosclerosis and Crohn 's disease ( 2 ) .
Unlike monocytes , macrophages are long-lived cells , resistant to many apoptotic stimuli including Fas and TNF-a death receptor ligation , ionizing radiation , and multiple antineoplastic or cytotoxic agents ( 3 ) .
We recently demonstrated that expression of Fas-associated death domain-like IL-1B-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein protected differentiated macrophages from Fas-mediated apoptosis ( 3 ) and that constitutively activated nuclear factor ( NF ) *-KB is essential for the expression Address correspondence to Richard M.

Alternatively , apoptosis may be initiated at the mitochondria by disruption of AY , , , , and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol ( 7 ) .
Mitochondria integrity is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins , which includes both antiapoptotic ( e.g .
, Bcl-2 , Bcl-x , and A1/Bfl-1 ; reference 8 ) and proapoptotic ( e.g .
, Bax , Bik , Bak , Bad , and Bid ; reference 7 ) family members .
Mice deficient in either src homology 2 domain-containing 5 ' inositol phosphatase or phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) possess increased numbers of macrophages ( 9 , 10 ) .
Both of these phosphatases normally function to suppress the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway ( 11 , 12 ) , suggesting that this pathway is critical for macrophage survival .
The serine/threonine kinase Akt-1 is a major target of PI3K ( 13 ) , which may be activated by a wide variety of stimuli including cytokines , chemokines , growth and survival fac-tors , and integrin ligation ( 14 , 15 ) .
Activation of the PI3K/ Akt-1 pathway protects against cell death induced by a variety of apoptotic stimuli .
Although the mechanisms responsible for protection have not been fully elucidated , the phosphorylation Bad or caspase-9 , suppression of FasL expression , and NF-KB activation may be induced through the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway ( 16-22 ) .
Although a prior study demonstrated that inhibition of the PI3K pathway resulted in apoptosis of murine peritoneal macrophages ( 15 ) , the mechanism by which the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway promotes macrophage survival is not known .
In this study , we investigated the role of Akt-1 in the survival of primary human monocyte-differentiated macrophages .
We observed that Akt-1 was constitutively expressed and activated in human macrophages .
Inhibition of Akt-1 activation resulted in macrophage apoptosis mediated through the loss of AW , , and the activation of caspases-9 and -3 .
Activated Akt-1 did not contribute to activation of NF-KB in macrophages .
Additionally , the inhibition of the Akt-1 had no effect on the expression of Fas or FasL , nor the expression or phosphorylation of Bad .
In contrast , inhibition of PI3K/Akt-1 was associated with decreased Mcl-1 expression , while other anti- or proapoptotic Bel-2 proteins were not altered .
These observations demonstrate that constitutively activated PI3K resulted in activation of Akt-1 and the expression of Mcl-1 , which were essential for macrophage survival .

Results Akt-1 Is Constitutively Activated by PI3K in Human Monocyte-differentiated Macrophages .
Earlier studies demonstrated that PI3K activation and pp70®®® were important in survival of peritoneal thioglycollate elicited macrophages ( 15 ) , although the role of Akt-1 was not examined .
Therefore , unstimulated in vitro-differentiated human macrophages were examined to determine if Akt-1 was constitutively activated .
Total and active phospho-Akt-1 were determined by Western blot analysis .
Akt-1 was constitutively activated in monocyte-differentiated macrophages and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 suppressed activation , but not the expression of Akt-1 at 24 and 36 h ( Fig .
1 ) .
Therefore , Akt-1 was constitutively activated in normal macrophages and its activation was mediated through the PI3K pathway .
Inhibition of PI3K or Akt-1 in Macrophages Induces Cell Death and Apoptosis of Human Monocyte-differentiated Macrophages .
To characterize the mechanism of Akt-1 activation , monocyte-differentiated macrophages were treated with varying concentrations of the PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 ( from 12 jum to 100 pum ) , or control medium 115 Liu et al .
24hrs 36hrs No DMSO LY DMSO LY rat P4 ® Figure 1 .
Akt-1 is constitutively activated in human macrophages , which is PI3K dependent .
The expression of total and activated Akt-1 was determined by immunoblot analysis .
Activated Akt-1 was detected using an antibody specific to phospho-Akt-1 ( P-Akt-1 , the activated form of Akt-1 ) .
Whole cell lysates from macrophages treated with LY294002 , or control medium ( DMSO ) , for the indicated periods of time , were probed for Akt-1 and P-Akt-1 by rabbit anti-total Akt-1 or phospho-Akt-1 antibodies ( New England Biolabs ) .
The final concentration of LY294002 ( LY ) is 50 M. The results shown are representative of four experiments .
- < « » Akt containing DMSO for 48 h. Cell death , determined by MTT , was observed at each concentration of LY 2942002 employed ( Fig .
2 A ) .
At 50 M , cell death was detected at 24 h , with > 80 % death by 48 h ( Fig .
2 C ) .
To determine if cell death was due to inhibition of Akt-1 , macrophages were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing a DN version of Akt-1 ( AdDNAkt-1 ) or the control vector ( AdGFP ) at concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 moi for 48 h ( 4 , 23 ) .
Macrophage cell death was observed in a dose-responsive fashion when cells were infected with AdDNAkt-1 compared with AdGFP ( Fig .
2 B ) .
Again , cell death was observed by 24 h of infection , increasing to > 80 % by 72 h ( Fig .
2 D ) .
These observations indicate that PI3K-activated Akt-1 is essential for macrophage survival .
The mechanism of macrophage death resulting from inhibition of Akt-1 was examined .
DNA fragmentation was observed by 12 h , which increased over the next 24 to 48 h after the addition of LY294002 ( Fig .
3 A ) or infection with AdDNAkt-1 ( Fig .
3 B ) .
Supporting the results obtained with LY294002 , another PI3K inhibitor , Wortmannin , also induced cell death and DNA fragmentation in human monocyte-differentiated macrophages ( data not shown ) .
Additionally , LY294002 and Wortmannin induced cell death and apoptosis in murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 ( data not shown ) .
The role of the mitochondria in the induction of DNA fragmentation was also determined by examining the loss of AY , , , , by Rh123 retention .
The loss of AW , , was observed as early as 12 h after the addition of LY294002 ( Fig .
3 C ) or infection with the AdDNAkt-1 ( Fig .
3 D ) .
In each in-stance , the loss of AF , , was associated with the induction of apoptosis , determined by DNA fragmentation ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) .
The loss of AY , , and DNA fragmentation were detected by 12 h after infection with AdDNAkt-1 , where as significant differences were first observed at 24 h after treatment with LY294002 .

Caspase Inhibition Reduces DNA Fragmentation Induced by the Inhibition of Akt-1 Activation , but Does Not Protect Mitochondrial Integrity or Promote Cell Survival .
To further characterize the role of caspase activation during macrophage apoptosis induced by PI3K/Akt-1 inhibition , cells were cultured with either a general caspase inhibitor ( z-VAD fmk ) or a specific inhibitor of caspase-9 ( z-LEHD .fmk ) in the presence of LY294002 .
Treatment with 100 M of z-V AD fmk or z-LEHD .fmk failed to prevent LY294002-induced mitochondrial dysfunction ( Fig .
6 A ) or cell death ( Pl-positive cells ) ( Fig .
6 C ) .
In contrast , DNA fragmentation was significantly decreased by the addition of either z-VAD .fmk or z-LEHD-.fmk ( Fig .
6 B ) .
The role of caspase activation was further characterized by examining the effect of z-VAD.fmk , on the activation of caspases-9 and -3 .
Caspase 9 ( Fig .
6 E ) and caspase-3 activity ( data not shown ) induced by inhibition of PI3K were both suppressed by treatment with z-VAD fmk .
Consistent with this observation , the cleavage of caspase-3 and PKCS ( Fig .
6 E ) induced by inhibition of PI3K/Akt-1 pathway was also suppressed .
These observations suggest that the loss of AY , , induced by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway , resulted in cell death , independent of caspase activation .

Activated Akt-1 may suppress the expression of FasL , which may be mediated by phosphorylation of forkhead transcription factors ( 30 ) .
However , the expression of Fas and FasL on the surface of macrophages , determined by flow cytometry , was not affected by LY294002 treatment ( data not shown ) .
Additionally , in order to determine if Fas-FasL interactions may have contributed to the induction of apoptosis after the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway , macrophages were pretreated with antagonistic anti-FasL antibody for 1 h before the addition of LY294002 .

ally , TNF-a was not detected in the culture supernatants of macrophages , even after adenoviral infection ( data not shown ) .
These data , together with the lack of protection of mitochondrial integrity by zVAD.fmk , suggest that death receptor signaling was not responsible for initiating LY294002-induced AW , , loss and apoptosis .
There Is No Relationship between Constitutively Activated NF-KB and Akt-1 in Normal Macrophages .
_ We recently demonstrate that NF-KB was constitutively activated , and protected against apoptosis , in differentiated macrophages ( 4 , 23 ) .
Additionally , recent studies have demonstrated that Akt-1 mediates the activation of NF-KB in certain cell types ( 21 , 22 , 31 , 32 ) .
To characterize the potential connection between the Akt-1 and NF-KB activation , studies were performed to determine if inhibition of Akt-1 activation decreased the constitutive activation of NF-KB in normal human macrophages .
Macrophages were treated 118 Constitutive Akt-1 Activation Is Essential for Macrophage Survival with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 for 24 and 48 h , and nuclear proteins were extracted for analysis by EMSA .
Neither LY294002 nor DN Akt-1 inhibited the constitutive activation of NF-KB in human monocyte-differentiated macrophages ( Fig .
7 , A-C ) .
Additionally , LY294002 did not interfere with the activation of NF-KB by TNF-a in macrophages ( Fig .
7 A ) .
To further clarify the relationship between the activation of Akt-1 and NF-KB , macrophages were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing NF-kB-inducing kinase ( NIK ; reference 33 ) .
The ectopic expression of NIK resulted in a marked increase of NF-KB activation , determined by EMSA , but failed to protect against apoptosis induced by treatment with LY 294002 ( data not shown ) .
Our results demonstrate that Akt-1 did not contribute to the constitutive activation of NF-KB in macrophages determined by the nuclear translo-cation of NF-KB and that increased NF-KB activation did not protect against the apoptosis induced after he inhibition of Akt-1 .
Recent studies have suggested that activated Akt-1 may enhance the transcriptional activity of NF-KB ( 34 ) .
Therefore , the effect of activated Akt-1 on the transcriptional activity of NF-KB in macrophages was examined .

-l 0 3 AdDNAkt-1 Akt-1 ( Myr Akt-1 ) rescued RAW 264.7 cells from apoptosis induced by LY294002 ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , Myr Akt-1 failed to enhance NF-KB transcriptional activity , which we previously demonstrated in these cells ( 4 ) , determined by cotransfection of a 3xKkB promoter-reporter ( Fig .
7 D ) .
Furthermore , there was no enhancement of NF-KB activation by cotransfection of the plasmid-expressing Myr Akt-1 together with one expressing the transcriptionally active p65 subunit of NF-KB ( Fig .
7 D ) .
Further supporting the lack of effect on the transcriptional activity of NF-KB , inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway in macrophages , did not reduce the expression of A1/Bfl-1 by reverse transcription PCR ( Fig .
9 B ) , which is exquisitely sensitive to the constitutive activation of NF-KB in macrophages ( 4 ) .
Together , these observations demonstrate that in macrophages , the protection against apoptosis observed with activated Akt-1 is not mediated through the activation of NF-KB .
Inhibition of PI3K/Akt-1 Has No Effect on the Expression of Apoptosis-related Molecules Bcl-2 , Bcl-x ; , Bax or Bad , but Results in Inhibition of Mc-1 .

The activation of Akt-1 does not contribute to the constitutive or the induced activation of NF-KB in macrophages .
( A ) Macrophages were washed three times and cultured in serum-free medium for 18 h. The cells were then treated with 50 M - LY294002 - or - control DMSO for 2 h. Finally macrophages were treated with 10 ng/ ml TNF- @ , 100 ng/ml LPS , or control medium as indicated for an additional 6 h. Nuclear extracts were harvested and EMSA was conducted .
The composition of the NF-KB complex was determined by supershift analysis using antibodies specific for NF- Sd WVIW 10.9uo0 ; god rmyaiip-+sod jo.guos+59d kB p65 and p50 , as indicated .

Macrophages were treated with 50 uM LY294002 or control DMSO for 24 or 48 h , before harvesting .
( D ) The 3xB promoter-reporter plasmid ( 1 jg ) was cotransfected with plasmid-expressing activated Akt-1 ( 1 jug MyrAkt ) alone or together with a plasmid-expressing NF-KB p65 ( 1 jug ) as described in Materials and Methods .
The cells were harvested after 18 h , and cell lysates were prepared to measure luciferase activity , which was determined as RLU per microgram of protein .
The results are presented as fold compared with cells transfected with the control plasmid ( no ) .
The results ( mean * 1 SE ) of a single experiment , performed in triplicate , are presented , which was representative of three experiments .

LY294002 did not influence the expression of antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2 or Bcl-x ; or the proapoptotic molecule Bax , as determined by Western blot analysis ( Fig .
8 A ) .
Similar results were obtained after infection with AdDNAkt-1 ( data not shown ) .
Additionally , no change in the expression of phosphorylated Bad , which may contribute to protection of mitochondrial integrity , was observed in response to LY294002 treatment ( Fig .
8 B ) .
Furthermore , the expression of Bcl-x , and A1/Bfl-1 ( 35 , 36 ) were not reduced after PI3K/Akt-1 inhibition by LY294002 ( Fig .

In contrast , inhibition of PI3K by treatment with LY294002 , or infection with AdDNAkt-1 , suppressed Mcl-1 expression in macrophages by 24 h ( Fig .
9 , A and B ) before the activation of caspase-3 ( Fig .
8 A ) .
These observations suggest that Mcl-1 may be the downstream target of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway responsible for protecting macrophage mitochondrial integrity .
Mcl-1 Is Essential for Macrophage Viability .
Since reduction of Mcl-1 was associated with cell death , experiments were performed to determine if Mcl-1 protected against cell death induced by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway .
These experiments were performed with RAW 264.7 murine macrophages , since inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway induced apoptosis , by a mechanism that was the same as observed in primary human macrophages ( data not shown ) .

After 24 h , the cells were treated with LY294002 or vehicle control and cell viability was determined .
Mcl-1 protected the RAW 264.7 macrophages from cell death induced by the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway ( Fig .
9 C ) .
These observations suggest that the constitutive activation of Akt-1 maintains the expression of Mcl-1 , which is necessary for the protection of mitochondrial integrity in macrophages .
To confirm that Mcl-1 was essential for macrophage viability , 7-d differentiated human macrophages were incubated with Mcl-1 antisense or control ( INV ) oligonucleotides .
The reduction of Mcl-1 by the antisense resulted in macrophage apoptosis ( Fig .
9 , D and E ) .
These observations support an essential role for Mcl-1 in protecting macrophages from apoptosis induced by the loss of mitochondrial integ- rity .
Discussion Prior studies using mice deficient in src homology 2 domain-containing 5 ' inositol phosphatase or PTEN demonstrated an expansion of their macrophage populations ( 9 , 10 ) .
Both of these phosphatases normally function to suppress the PI3K pathway ( 11 , 12 ) , suggesting that this pathway may be unique and critical for macrophage survival .
The potential mechanisms by which this pathway may be important in macrophage survival have not been character-ized .
This study is the first to demonstrate that Akt-1 was constitutively activated in human monocyte-differentiated macrophages , and that specific inhibition of Akt-1 resulted in apoptotic cell death mediated by the loss of mitochondrial integrity .
To date most studies have focused on the role of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway in the regulation of apoptosis in proliferating cells rather than in terminally differentiated cells , such as macrophages .
Although the mechanism responsible for the constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway in the differentiated human macrophages was not characterized in our manu-script , it is possible that factors present in serum may be im-portant .
Lysophosphatidic acid , M-CSF , and 1a , 25-dihy-droxyvitamin D ; , which may be present in normal serum , are capable of activating the PI3K pathway ( 15 , 37 , 38 ) .
It is not possible to withhold serum during monocyte to macrophage differentiation , since we have shown that most monocytes die by Fas-FasL-mediated apoptosis without serum ( 3 ) .
However , serum deprivation for 24 to 96 h after differentiation did not result in macrophage death ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the continued presence of a factor in serum was not necessary for the survival of terminally differentiated human macrophages .
In contrast , murine thioglycollate-elicited macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages , which proliferate in culture ( 39 ) , died in the absence of serum or CSF-1 ( 15 , 40 ) .
These observations suggest that the murine macrophages ( 15 , 40 ) may not be terminally differentiated or that the mechanism of protection against cell death was different , perhaps due to proliferation or activation that occurred during recruitment and isolation .

The transfected cells were then treated with 50 M LY294002 , where indicated , for 24 h. The cells were harvested and the number of enhanced GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry .

The results presented in each panel are representative of two or three experiments .
Akt-1 has been shown to promote cell survival , and protect against apoptosis , by a number of mechanisms .
However , the mechanisms by which the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway contributes to the survival of terminally differentiated macrophages have not been described previously .
Akt-1 activation , in certain cell types , may promote survival by protecting against Fas signaling ( 41 ) .
Additionally , PTEN*'~ mice demonstrate impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis that is restored by PI3K inhibitors ( 10 ) .
However , our data do not support a role for death receptor signaling after the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway .
The broad-based caspase inhibitor z-VAD fmk protected against DNA fragmentation , a characteristic feature of the apoptotic phenotype , however , it failed to protect against the loss of AF , , or cell death , suggesting that activation of the initiator caspase-8 was not responsible .
Additionally , we observed no change in the expression of Fas or FasL on the cell surface , and antagonistic anti-FasL antibody did not prevent the apoptosis observed ( data not shown ) .
These observations demonstrate that , after inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway , death receptor ligation and caspase-8 activation did not initiate macrophage apoptosis and cell death .
121 Liu et al .
Akt-1 may regulate cell survival at a postmitochondrial level , after the release of cytochrome c , by inhibiting the activation or activity of caspase-9 ( 18 , 42 ) .
In a previous study , cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-9 was inhibited by either z-V AD fmk or activated Akt-1 ( 42 ) .
In macrophages , inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway with either LY294002 or the DN Akt-1 resulted in loss of AF , , and cytochrome c release .
However , caspase inhibition by either z-VAD .fmk or a caspase-I-specific inhibitor partially protected against DNA fragmentation , but failed to protect against the loss of AW , , or cell death .
These observations demonstrate that the protection provided by constitutively activated Akt-1 , that was essential for macrophage survival , was upstream of the loss of AY , , and did not require caspase activation .
Inhibition of caspase activation altered the apoptotic phenotype ( i.e .
, DNA fragmentation and PKC8 cleavage ) , but did not protect against cell death .
It is possible that mechanisms other than the loss of AY , , may have contributed directly to cell death .
Apoptosis-inducing factor ( AIF ) , when released from the mitochondria after the loss of AYF , , , translocates to the nucleus , inducing chroma-tin condensation and DNA fragmentation , independent of caspase activation ( 43 , 44 ) .
Consistent with a role AIF in cell death , z-VAD.fmk only partially protected against DNA fragmentation , after inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway .
Therefore , the loss of AY , , and the subsequent release of AIF may both have directly contributed to macrophage death after inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway .
Supporting the central role for the loss of AY , , in the induction of cell death after the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway , the ectopic expression of Bel- , protected not only against DNA fragmentation , but also prevented the loss of AY , , and cell death , even though no reduction of endogenous Bcl-x , or Bcel-2 was observed .
Prior studies have demonstrated that activated Akt-1 phosphorylated Bad ( 17 , 45 ) , which inhibited the binding of Bad with Bcl-x } , thereby promoting survival and protecting against apoptosis .
Although this mechanism would result in apoptosis and cell death initiated by loss of AY , , , , no effect on the expression or phosphorylation of Bad in macrophages after inhibition of PI3K/Akt-1 activity .
Similar to this observation , other studies have not observed an effect on the phosphorylation of Bad after the inhibition of Akt-1 in fibroblasts and a neuronal cell line ( 19 , 46 ) .
These data suggest that , although Bad may be involved in a cell-type and stimulus-specific fashion , it was not involved in macrophage apoptosis observed after the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway .
We recently demonstrated that the constitutive activation of NF-KB was essential for the survival of macrophages by maintaining mitochondrial integrity ( 4 ) .
Therefore , experiments were performed to determine if Akt-1 contributed to NF-KB activation in macrophages , as recently demonstrated in other cell types ( 31 , 32 , 34 , 47 ) .
In contrast to these observations , inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway had no effect on the constitutive or TNF-o-stimulated activation of NF-KB in macrophages , as determined by EMSA .
Consistent with this observation , TNF-a failed to induce activation of Akt-1 in monocytes ( 48 ) .
We also observed no effect of Akt-1 on the transcriptional activity of NF-KB in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line , in contrast to recent studies in other cell types ( 34 , 47 ) .
Our study directly examined the effects of Myr Akt-1 on the constitutive and the NF-KB p65 induced activation of a NF-KB promoter-reporter construct .
The differences observed between the studies may be due to the experimental design or cell-type differences ( 34 , 47 ) .
Cell-type differences may be important since Myr Akt-1 activated a KB promoter in 313 cells ( 34 ) , but not in RAW 264.7 macrophages , even though Myr Akt-1 protected the RAW 264.7 cells against cell death induced by inhibition of the PI3K pathway .
Further supporting a mechanism independent of NF-KB , the ectopic expression of NIK , which resulted in strong activation of NF-KB in macrophages , failed to protect against cell death induced after the inhibition of the PI3K pathway .
Also , expression of the activated form of Akt-1 in macrophages , which protected against the apoptosis observed after treatment with LY294002 , failed to activate NF- < B ( data not shown ) .
Additionally , we previously we observed demonstrated that the antiapoptotic molecule A1 was an important downstream target of the constitutively activated NF-KB in macrophages ( 4 ) .
However , after PI3K/Akt-1 inhibition , no reduction in the expression of A1/Bfl-1 was observed .
This observation is consistent with the lack of effect of PI3K/Akt-1 on the transcriptional activity of NF-kB , since A1/Bfl-1 expression in macrophages was exquisitely regulated by constitutively activated NF-KB ( 4 ) .
These observations demonstrate that the protection provided by the constitutively activated PI3K/Akt-1 pathway in macrophages was independent of the NF-KB activation .
These observations support the independent role of A1 , regulated by constitutively activated NF-KB and Mcl-1 , regulated by the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway , in maintaining mitochondrial integrity , protecting against spontaneous apoptosis , in primary differentiated macrophages .
The independence of the pathways is further supported by the observation that the apoptosis induced by inhibition of A1/ NF-KB does not result in activation of caspase-3 ( 4 ) , while that which results from inhibition of PI3K/Akt-1/Mel-1 does result in caspase-3 activation .
This suggests that multiple pathways promote macrophage survival , even without specific stimulation or stress .
Since the loss of AW , , induced by PI3K/Akt-1 inhibition was protected by Bcl-x , the expression of Bcl-2 family members was examined .
Although Akt-1 regulated T lymphocyte survival , NF-KB activation and Bcl-x , expression ( 49 ) , we did not detect an effect of PI3K/Akt-1 inhibition on the expression of Bcl-x , consistent with other studies ( 19 , 46 ) .
These differences may be due to cell-type and/or stimulus-specific differences .
Also , no change in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecules Bel-2 or A1 or the proapoptotic molecule Bax was observed .
In contrast , the expression of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein was reduced after inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway in macrophages .
Supporting the importance of Mcl-1 in macrophages , Mcl-1 expression protected against the apoptotic cell death observed in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line after inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway .
Supporting the relevance of this observation , apoptosis induced in this cell line was associated with loss of AY , , DNA fragmentation , and cell death that was prevented by the expression of activated Akt-1 .
The essential role of Mcl-1 in primary macrophages was further supported by the observation that reduction of Mcl-1 by antisense oligonucleotides resulted in macrophage apoptosis .
An earlier study demonstrated that ml-1 was regulated the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway through a transcription factor complex containing the cAMP response-element-binding protein ( 50 ) .
These observations support an essential role for Mcl-1 , mediated by the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway , in promoting macrophage viability , by maintaining mitochondrial integrity .
Mcl-1 , a Bcl-2 family member , is critical to embryonic development since deletion of this gene resulted in periim-plantation embryonic lethality ( 51 ) .
Mcl-1 has been found to exhibit differentiation stage-specific expression in a variety of hematopoietic lineages ( 52 ) .
Overexpression of Mcl-1 delayed apoptosis induced by c-myc , growth factor with 122 Constitutive Akt-1 Activation Is Essential for Macrophage Survival drawal , and other cytotoxic agents , and reduced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria ( 53-55 ) .
In contrast , our data suggest that Mcl-1 expression was essential in maintaining mitochondrial integrity in macrophages , in the absence of an exogenous death-inducing signal .
Supporting this conclusion , mice transgenic for Mcl-1 demonstrated prolonged viability of both mature and immature myeloid cells ( 56 ) .
Additionally , antisense-mediated inhibition of Mcl-1 resulted in apoptosis of PMA-treated U937 mono-cytic cells ( 24 ) .
Overall , these observations support the importance of the PI3K/Akt-1 mediated-expression of Mcl-1 in maintaining macrophage viability .
Although the mechanism by which Mcl-1 protects macrophage mitochondrial integrity was not examined , in a yeast two-hybrid analysis , Mcl-1 bound avidly to Bax ( 57 ) .
Bax overexpression resulted in death by induction of mitochondrial permeability transition ( 58 , 59 ) , similar to the results observed after the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway .
Supporting this mechanism , reduction of Bcl-x , another Bcl-2 family member capable of binding to Bax , resulted in Bax-mediated cell death ( 60 ) .
These observations suggest that reduction of Mcl-1 in macrophages may lead to enhanced Bax activity , although the expression of Bax was not altered , which resulted in cell death mediated through the loss of mitochondrial integrity .
These observations provide insights into potentially novel mechanisms to regulate macrophage survival in conditions such as atherosclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis .
