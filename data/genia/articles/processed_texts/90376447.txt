10 The Internal Methionine Codons of Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type II rex Gene Are Not Required for p24 ' `` °* Production or Virus Replication and Transformation PATRICK L. GREEN , `` YIMING XIE , ' anp IRVIN S. Y. CHEN'** Division of Hematology-Oncology , Department of and Department of Microbiology and Immunology , `` UCLA School of Medicine and Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center , Los Angeles , California 90024-1736 Received 21 May 1990/Accepted 12 July 1990 Human T-cell leukemia virus types I ( HTLV-I ) and II ( HTLV-II ) have two nonstructural trans-acting regulatory genes , tax and rex , located in the 3 ' region of the viral genome .
The tax gene product ( HTLV-I p40** and HTLV-II p37 `` ) is the transcriptional activator of the viral long terminal repeat .
The rex gene encodes two protein products , p27 `` */p21 ' `` `` * and p26*/p24 ' `` ** in HTLV-I and HTLV-II , respectively .
Rex acts posttranscriptionally to facilitate accumulation of full-length gag/po !
and singly spliced envy mRNA in the cytoplasm of HTLV -infected cells .
Previous studies showed that the first ATG of the rex gene is critical for Rex production and function .
The importance of the internal ATGs to Rex function is not known .
However , in vitro mutagenesis of the HTLV-I rex gene has provided indirect evidence which suggests that p21 `` * , and by analogy HTLV-II p24 ' `` * , results from initiation at an internal AUG of the tfax/rex mRNA .
By using an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-II , we investigated the importance of the internal ATGs of the rex gene on Rex protein production and function .
Our results indicate that p24'** of HTLV-II is not initiated at an internal AUG and that the internal methionine codons are not crucial to the function of the rex gene and , ultimately , the transforming properties of the virus .
Human T-cell leukemia virus types I ( HTLV-I ) and II ( HTLV-II ) have been identified as the causative agents of some forms of leukemia and chronic neurological disorders in humans .
HTLV-I causes adult T-cell leukemia in a small percentage of seropositive individuals ( 18 , 33 ) and , more recently , has been linked with a progressive demyelinating syndrome termed HTLV-I-associated myelopathy ( 32 ) or tropical spastic paraparesis ( 11 ) .
HTLV-II has been associated only with rare forms of T-cell leukemia related to hairy-cell leukemia ( 22 , 38 , 40 ) , and thus its disease association is less substantiated .
However , recent studies revealed that a significant percentage of intravenous drug abusers in the United States and Europe harbor HTLV-II ( 25 , 36 , 49 ) , indicating that the virus is more prevalent in the population than first estimated .
HTLV transforms peripheral blood T lymphocytes in vitro , as defined by their continuous proliferation in the absence of exogenous interleukin-2 ( 7 , 34 , 50 ) , even though its genome lacks a classical oncogene and does not insert at specific sites within the host genome ( 41 , 42 ) .
Three mRNA species have been identified for HTLV .
A full-length genomic mRNA ( 8.2 kilobases [ kb ] ) and a subgenomic mRNA ( 4.3 kb ) , in which one intron is spliced out , encode the characteristic retroviral Gag and Pol proteins and Env protein , respectively .
A second subgenomic mRNA ( 2.1 kb ) , which has an additional intron removed , encodes both the tax and rex gene products via translation in separate overlapping reading frames .
The tax reading frame produces a 40-kilodalton protein in HTLV-I ( p40'* ) and a 37-kilodalton protein in HTLV-II ( p37 ' `` * ) , which localizes to the nucleus of infected cells ( 12 , 21 , 29 , 46 ) .
Tax has been shown to increase the rate of transcription from the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( 4 , 5 , 10 , 43 ) , as well as from the cellular genes * Corresponding author .
4914 for interleukin-2 ( 26 ) , the interleukin-2 receptor ( 1 , 8 , 19 ) , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( 31 , 51 ) .
Several studies have implicated Tax in the HTLV oncogenic process ( 14 , 30 , 48 ) .
The rex reading frame produces two proteins of 27 and 21 kilodaltons in HTLV-I ( p27'** and p21 `` ** ) ( 23 ) and 26 and 24 kilodaltons in HTLV-II ( p26 ' `` ** and p24'* ) ( 37 , 44 ) .
Amino-terminal deletions of Rex coding sequences and specific point mutations which abolish Rex protein production indicate that Rex acts posttranscriptionally to increase the ratio of incompletely spliced mRNAs ( encoding Gag , Pol , and Env proteins ) to completely spliced mRNA ( encoding Tax and Rex ) , resulting in highly regulated viral gene expression ( 16 , 17 , 20 ) .
The individual contribution of the smaller rex gene product , if any , has not been determined .
The precise relationship of the two rex gene products is not known , although it has been established that both proteins share the same carboxy terminus ( 28 ) .
One study which involved in vitro translation of in vitro-synthesized HTLV-I RNA containing specific site-directed mutations in the rex open reading frame demonstrated that deletion of an internal methionine initiation codon resulted in the loss of ( 29 ) .
These results suggested that p21 ' `` * is synthesized from an internal methionine initiation codon of the doubly spliced fax/rex mRNA .
Studies corroborating these results have not been performed in infected cells , due to the lack of an infectious clone of HTLV-I ; thus , the function of the smaller Rex protein has not been elucidated .
By using an infectious clone of HTLV-II , we investigated the importance of the internal methionine codons of the rex gene on p24 `` production , viral replication , and transformation .
By using site-directed mutagenesis , the internal ATGs in the rex reading frame were systematically mutated .
We report here that p24 `` * is not initiated at an internal methionine codon and that the internal methionine codons are not crucial to the function of the rex gene .

64 , 1990 MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines .
729-6 , an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B-cell line , was maintained in Iscove medium supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and antibiotics .
BJAB , an Epstein-Barr-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line ( kindly provided by W. Hall , Cornell University ) , was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FCS and antibiotics .
Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque of fresh blood obtained from normal donors or from leukopacks purchased from the Red Cross .
These cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 % FCS and antibiotics .
Plasmids and mutagenesis .
pHG6neo , an HTLV-II infectious proviral clone , LTR-II-CAT , and SV2neo have been described previously ( 6 , 45 ) .
Plasmids with the prefix `` BC `` are all derived from the plasmid BC12/CMV/IL-2 ( 9 ) , which contains a simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) origin of replication and the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter .
Proper insertion of genes downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter results in high levels of expression in 729 cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes .
BCHTLV contains the complete coding region of HTLV-II ( BamHI-BamHI , nucleotides [ nt ] 361 to 8550 ) and expresses all viral gene products .
BCHTLVCla ( Tax~ and Rex~T ) , BCHTLVSph ( Rex~ ) , and BCHTLVrex term ( Rex~T ) contain rex and/or tax mutations that have been previously described ( 37 ) .
BCHTLV-UT contains a deletion in the apparently nontranslated region between nt 6660 and 6984 ( pH6neo-UT contains the identical deletion in the pHG6neo vector ) .
BCHTLV-SA contains a 550-base-pair ( bp ) deletion in the nontranslated region between nt 6660 and 7210 , which also results in removal of the splice acceptor signal sequence for tax/rex exon 3 , and thus is Tax~ and Rex~ ( pH6neo-SA contains the identical deletion in the pH6neo vector ) .
Oligomer-directed site-specific mutagenesis was performed in the M13-based vector , Blue-script KS+ ( Stratagene ) , which contains the Xhol-Sacl fragment of pHG6neo ( nt 6209 to 8662 ) , by the method described by Kunkel ( 24 ) .
The three internal ATGs in the rex reading frame were systematically mutated to ACG , which , upon translation , would result in a amino acid substitution of threonine for methionine .
Mutations were confirmed by either dideoxy sequencing or Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ( 27 , 39 ) .
These mutations were designated M1 ( nt 7248 , T to C ) , M2 ( nt 7338 , T to C ) , and M3 ( nt 7389 , T to C ) and were cloned back into the vectors described above ( pHGneo and BCHTLV ) for characterization .
Electroporation and CAT assays .
Electroporations were performed as described previously by using a Bio-Rad gene pulser and extender ( 3 ) .
Briefly , cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline , counted , and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 % FCS and antibiotics at a concentration of 2 x 10 `` cells per ml .
A total of 5 x 10° cells , together with plasmid DNA , were exposed to a 960-uF charge with a 250-V potential .
Cells were transferred to 10 ml of medium and grown at 37°C for 48 h. To isolate stable transfectants containing pHGneo-derived DNA , cells were plated into 24-well culture dishes ( 5 x 10° cells per well ) under G418 selection ( 1.5 mg/ml ; GIBCO Laboratories ) .
Following a 2- to 3-week selection period , wells which grew were pooled , and these mass cultures were maintained for further analysis .
Cell extracts for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assays were processed 48 h posttransfection as described previously ( 13 ) .
CAT reactions were standardized for equivalent levels of protein HTLV-II rex GENE 4915 ( determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay ) , and percentages of [ '*CJchloramphenicol acetylation were quantified by scintillation counting of excised spots .
Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation .
Stable 729 transfected cell lines were labeled at 10° cells per ml with [ ?
*S ) methionine-cysteine ICN Biochemicals , Inc. [ 100 pwCi/ml ] ) in methionine-cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % dialyzed FCS .
Cells were labeled overnight at 37°C .
Cells were lysed in radioimmuno-precipitation buffer , and the lysates were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 h. The lysates were immunoprecipitated by using either HTLV-II-specific human antisera or antibody directed against the COOH-terminal tridecapeptide sequence encoded by rex ( 44 ) .
Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose ( Pharmacia , Inc. ) , and the proteins were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels .
Gels were treated with ( Dupont , NEN Research Products ) for fluorography and exposed to X-Omat R film ( Eastman Kodak Co. ) .
DNA transfer and hybridization .
High-molecular-weight DNA was extracted from stable 729 transfectants or HTLV-II-infected BJAB cells and analyzed by the method of Southern ( 47 ) , as described elsewhere ( 15 ) .
The probe consisted of an HTLV ( 1,176 bp Xhol-Clal fragment ) *P-oligo-labeled fragment .
RNA preparation and S1 nuclease analysis .
Total cellular RNA was prepared by lysing the cells in 4.7 M urea-1.3 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-0.23 M NaCl-6.7 mM Tris ( pH 8.0 ) -0.67 mM EDTA , followed by three phenol-chloroform extractions .
RNA was pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a CsCl pad ( 30,000 rpm for 16 h ) , suspended in 10 mM Tris , pH 7.6-1 mM EDTA , and the concentration was determined by spectrophotometry .
S1 nuclease analysis was performed with 25 ug of total RNA ( 5 ug of sample RNA and 20 pg of uninfected cell RNA ) and a [ y- > P ] dATP-labeled 90-nt oligonucleotide probe for the cap site of HTLV-II ( nt 294 to 383 ) , as described previously ( 2 ) .
RESULTS Construction of rex internal methionine codon mutants .
Figure 1 shows the genomic structure of HTLV-II and the single 2.1-kb doubly spliced mRNA which encodes the trans-regulatory gene products , Tax and Rex , in separate but partially overlapping reading frames .
The well-characterized methionine ( Met ) initiation codon for the larger Rex species ( p26 ) is at nt 5121 .
The Met initiator codon for the trans-activator protein , p37 `` , is located downstream at nt 5180 .
Previous HTLV-I rex gene mutagenesis studies have suggested that the smaller rex gene product , p21 ' `` , is initiated at an internal Met codon .
The HTLV-II rex gene contains three potential internal Met initiation codons located at nt 7248 , 7338 , and 7389 ( Fig .
1 ) , the latter of which corresponds to the one in HTLV-I that was thought to be responsible for p21 `` ** production ( 29 ) .
The internal Met codons of the HTLV-II rex gene were systematically mutated to code for threonine ( Thr ) by site-directed mutagenesis .
Both Tax and Rex have been shown to be critical for viral replication and transformation .
Since Tax and Rex are encoded in partially overlapping reading frames , informative mutagenesis studies require that the rex mutations be silent in the tax reading frame .
Therefore , the HTLV-II rex gene mutants , referred to as M1 , M2 , and M3 ( Table 1 ) , were designed so as not to alter the amino acid sequence of Tax ; the mutations were confirmed by sequencing ( data not shown ) .

Structural features of the HTLV-II genome and HTLV-II tax/rex mRNA and coding sequence .
The complete proviral genome is shown schematically .

Pertinent restriction enzyme recognition sites are listed ( B , BamHI ; C , Clal ; M , Miul ) .
The 2.1-kb doubly spliced taxirex mRNA and the Tax and Rex coding sequences and protein sizes are represented below the genome .
The tax AUG ( nt 5180 ) and rex AUG ( nt 5121 ) are indicated .
The three internal methionine ( AUG ) codons ( M1 , M2 , and M3 ) , which were mutated to code for threonine in this study , and their nucleotide locations in the rex reading frame , based on the HTLV-II pH6neo proviral sequence , are indicated .
Functional analysis of rex mutants by CAT assay .
The rex gene Met codon mutants described above were inserted into full-length viral expression plasmids , and their ability to trans activate LTR-linked gene expression was determined in CAT assays .
The pH6neo vector contains the complete HTLV-II provirus , and transcription from the native LTR responds to regulation by the frans-regulatory gene products , Tax and Rex .
BCHTLV contains the complete coding regions of HTLV-II under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter , resulting in con-stitutive viral gene expression .
This vector is analogous to SV-HTLV , previously reported using the SV40 early promoter ( 37 ) .
We previously reported that loss of Rex function results in a decrease in LTR-directed gene expression as measured by CAT activity , which can be complemented by addition of Rex in trans ( 37 ) .
This altered LTR activity is due to a combination of both a Tax effect at the level of transcription and a Rex effect that is posttranscriptional .
We used this assay to determine whether our internal rex Met codon mutants were functional .

The Cla mutation frameshifts both rex ( 79 amino acids in frame plus 192 amino acids out of frame ) and rax ( 59 amino acids in frame plus 92 amino acids out of frame ) .
The Sph mutation deletes the first initiator Met codon of rex , resulting in loss of Rex production and function .
The rex term truncates Rex at amino acid 79 .
M1 , M2 , and M3 were made by site-directed mutagenesis , as described in the Materials and Methods .
Nucleotide and amino acid numbers are based on the nucleotide sequerice and Tax ( 331 amino acids ) and Rex ( 170 amino acids ) protein sequences of the HTLV-II proviral clone , pH6neo .
® fs , Frameshift .
Wild-type and tax and/or rex mutant HTLV-II expression vectors were cotransfected with LTR-II-CAT into 729 B cells , and the functional levels of Tax and Rex were monitored by measuring the amount of CAT activity ( Fig .
2 ) .
The wild-type constructs ( BCHTLV and pH6neo ) significantly activated the HTLV-II LTR .
Comparison of the percent acetylation indicated that the cytomegalovirus promoter is more active than the HTLV-II promoter in 729 cells ( 88-fold versus 15-fold over background ) .
A mutation which frameshifts both rax and rex ( BCHTLVCla ) results in no trans activation above baseline levels , as previously reported ( 4 ) .
Mutation of the first rex ATG ( BCHTLVSph ) or a mutation resulting in premature termination of rex ( BCHTLVrex term ) , both of which do not alter tax , significantly reduced CAT activity as compared with the wild type , confirming previous results that HTLV-II Rex influences LTR-directed gene expression ( 37 ) .
Two additional mutants tested and used as positive and negative controls throughout these studies are BCHTLV-UT/pH6neo-UT and BCHTLV-SA/pH6neo-SA , respectively .
Both mutants contain deletions in the nontranslated Acetylation FIG .

Representative CAT assay .
LTR-II-CAT and various HTLV-II expression constructs indicated above were introduced into 729 B cells , and percent acetylation was measured as described in the Materials and Methods .
Various mutations ( described in the Materials and Methods ) were analyzed in the context of complete HTLV-II genomes expressed either from their own promoter ( pHGneo-derived constructs ) or from the cytomegalovirus early promoter ( BCHTLV-derived constructs ) .

Southern hybridization analysis of the 729 stable transfectant cell DNA .
Ten micrograms of high-molecular-weight cell DNA , as labeled , was double digested with BamHI and Clal or with BamHI and Miul ( indicated by an asterisk ) , electrophoresed through a 0.7 % agarose gel , blotted to nitrocellulose paper , and hybridized with a *°P-labeled , HTLV-II-specific 1,176-bp probe ( Xhol [ nt 6209 ] -Cial [ nt 7384 ] ) .
The labeled arrows , in base pairs , indicate approximate sizes of expected HTLV-II-specific fragments and were determined by comparison with HindIII digests of lambda and SV40 DNAs .
region between env and tax/rex exon 3 .
However , the SA deletion removes all but four nucleotides of the splice acceptor site for rax/rex exon 3 , which should abolish normal splicing of fax/rex mRNA and interfere with production of Tax and Rex .
When tested in CAT assays , the UT mutant shows wild-type CAT activity , and as expected , the SA mutant is incapable of trans activation .
The CAT activities of the rex Met codon mutants , M1 , M2 , and M3 , are comparable to wild-type levels , indicating that both Tax and Rex are fully functional in this assay ( Fig .
2 ) .
In addition , similar relative activities were seen with the rex Met codon mutants in the two vector systems ( BCHTLYV or pH6neo ) , indicating that in this functional analysis of Tax and Rex , vector transcriptional control is not a factor .
These results indicate that mutation of the internal methionine codons for the rex gene does not impair the function of the protein as measured in transient CAT assays , whereas mutation of the initial Met codon or rex carboxy-terminal truncation abolishes Rex activity .
Isolation of stable transfectants .
To further characterize effects of mutations within the rex gene on aspects of the virus life cycle , including RNA expression , protein production , and budding of infectious virions , stable 729 cell transfectants containing pHG6neoM1L , pHGneoM2 , and pH6neoM3 , along with positive and negative controls , were isolated .
Stable transfectants are prefixed by ©729 , `` followed by the full-length HTLV-II proviral clone with which they were transfected ( i.e .
, 729pHGneo is a stable line transfected with the clone pH6neo ) .
To confirm the presence of HTLV-II proviral DNA in the stable transfectants , cell DNA was analyzed by nucleic acid hybridization following digestion with diagnostic restriction endonucleases ( BamHI , Clal , and M/ul ) .
All stable transfectants analyzed contained complete copies of the HTLV-II rex GENE 491 % FIG .

S1 nuclease analysis of 729 stable transfectant RNA Total cellular RNA was prepared from stable transfectants , a : described in the Materials and Methods .
A total of 25 ug of RNA ( ( ug of transfectant RNA , as labeled in the figure , and 20 ug oi negative control 729 RNA ) was subjected to S1 nuclease analysi : with a [ y-*°P ] JdATP-labeled 90-nt oligonucleotide which spans the transcription start site of HTLV-II .
A 70-nt fragment is protected by mRNA synthesized from the cap site .
The 90-nt fragment protectec is due to complete protection of the probe by the 3 ' terminus of the RNA due to redundancy of sequences in the LTR .
The labelec arrows , in base pairs , are marker sizes ( y-*P-end-labeled pGEM digested with Sau3A ) .
HTLV-II provirus ( data not shown ) .
Comparison of hybridization intensities of the predicted size fragments in the different transfectants indicates that HTLV-II DNA is present in similar copy number ( Fig .
3 ) .
The 729pH6neoM:2 cell line DNA can be distinguished from both the wild-type ( 729pH6neo ) and other mutant ( 729pH6neoMI1 and 729pHGneoM2 ) cell line DNAs , since the M3 mutation resulted in loss of the Clal restriction site ( Fig .
3 ) .
The smaller sizes of the hybridizing bands in both 729pH6neo-UT and 729pH6neo-SA also confirms the respective deletions of 324 and 550 bp in the nontranslated region .
Cell lines containing pHG6neoM1Ll and pHG6neoM2 DNA , which can not be distinguished from wild-type DNA ( pH6neo ) by restriction enzyme mapping , were confirmed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified products of stable transfectant cell DNA ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the stable 729 cell transfectants have integrated full-length HTLV-II proviral DNA and the constructed mutations are still present following transfectior and selection .
Expression of viral RNA .
We investigated the effect of these internal Met codon mutations in the rex gene on viral RNA expression .
Total cellular RNA was isolated from the stable transfectants and subjected to S1 nuclease analysis by using a 90-nt oligonucleotide probe spanning the transcription start ( cap ) site .
The presence of correctly initiate HTLV-II mRNA results in protection of a 70-nt band .
A 70-nt band of approximately equal intensities was protectec in 729pH6neo , 729pH6neoM1 , 729pH6neoM2 , and 729pHt neoM } 3 stable transfectant RNA , whereas this band was nol present in 729pH6neo-SA RNA ( Fig .

Immunoprecipitation of [ **S ) methionine-cysteine-labeled stable transfectant cell lines .
Cells were metabolically labeled , and cell lysates were prepared as described in Materials and Methods .
( A ) 729 stable transfectant cell lysate , as labeled , was immunoprecipitated with HTLV-II patient antisera .
( B ) 729 stable transfected cell lysates , as labeled , were immunoprecipitated with antisera directed against the COOH terminus of the rex gene products .
'*C-labeled protein markers were purchased from Amersham Corp. , and sizes are listed .
consistent with the CAT assay data presented in Fig .
2 .
S1 nuclease analysis of tax/rex doubly spliced mRNA revealed similar results ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the Met to Thr mutations within the Rex protein do not have an effect on transcription of viral RNA .
Viral proteins expressed by Rex Met mutants .
The stable transfectants were metabolically labeled with [ **SJmethio-nine-cysteine , and immunoprecipitations were performed on cell lysates to determine which viral proteins were being produced .
Previous studies indicated that selective point mutations or amino-terminal truncation of the rex gene resulted in the loss of Gag and Env protein expression and , thus , loss of production and release of infectious virions .
Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with HTLV-II patient antisera followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography indicated that the stable transfectants containing the rex internal Met codon mutations all produced significant levels of Gag ( Fig .
5A ) .
In this particular experiment , 729pH6neoM3 appeared to produce more Gag and 729pH6neoM1 produced less Gag than the wild type ; however , this variation was not reproducible .
Therefore , the rex internal Met codon mutants are all functional and allow Gag protein to be produced .
To determine which rex gene products were being produced in the stable transfectants , cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antisera which recognize the carboxy terminus of Rex and detect both Rex proteins ( p26'* and p24 `` ) .
Both p26 `` and are produced in 729pH6neoM1 , 729pH6neoM2 , and 729pHGneoM3 , and the levels of these proteins are comparable to those of the wild-type 729pHG6Gneo ( Fig .
5B ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that the internal methionines of the Rex protein are not important for the functions of Rex identified to date .
In addition , these results suggest that the smaller rex gene product of HTLV-II , p24 `` , is not initiated at one of the internal Met codons .
Production of infectious virus and transformation .
We determined the effect of the rex Met codon mutations on virus production , replication , and transformation .
The supernatant of the stable transfectants was assayed for the presence of virus by measuring in vitro reverse transcriptase activity .
Reverse transcriptase activity was detected in the supernatant of all stable transfectants , and the activity did not differ by more than twofold ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the stable rex Met codon mutant transfectants release virus into the culture supernatant at levels similar to those of the wild-type transfectants .
To further demonstrate that the rex internal Met codon mutant viruses were capable of a productive infection , the stable transfectants were cocultured with the BJAB cell line .
BJAB cells were used , since upon infection by HTLV-II , a rapid induction of syncytia with some cytopathicity results .
Coculture of the 729 rex Met codon mutant transfectants with BJAB cells resulted in syncytium formation with the same efficiency as 729pH6neo , and syncytia could be induced with as few as 10 irradiated producer cells ( Table 2 ) .
These results indicate that the 729 rex Met codon mutants ( M1 , M2 , M3 ) are producing infectious virus .
Following coculture of the producer cells with the BJAB cells , the cultures were maintained for 3 weeks by adding fresh BJAB Vor .

To determine whether HTLV-II proviral DNA was present in the BJAB cells cocultured with the 729 transfectants , cell DNA was analyzed by nucleic acid hybridization following digestion with diagnostic restriction endonucleases ( BamHI , Clal , and Milul ) .
All stable BJAB cocultures positive for syncytium formation contained HTLV-II proviral DNA ( Fig .
6 ) .
It was also important to confirm the stability of the rex Met codon mutations in the BJAB-infected culture and to ascertain whether these mutations reverted in culture .
The M3 mutation , which eliminated the Clal restriction site , was still present , as determined by the inability of Clal to digest HTLV-II M3-infected BJAB high-molecular-weight DNA .

The labeled arrows , in base pairs , indicate expected HTLV-II-specific fragments and were determined by comparison with HindIII digests of lambda and SV40 DNAs .
HTLV-II rex GENE 4919 mutations , were confirmed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified products of BJAB coculture DNA ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , we conclude that the rex internal Met codon mutant viruses are stable and infectious in BJAB cells .
To determine whether the rex Met codon mutations altered the ability of the virus to transform primary T cells , irradiated 729 producer cells were cocultured with primary T lymphocytes .
Three to four weeks following coculture , stable transformed T cells grew out for all rex internal Met codon mutants ( Table 2 ) .
These results further confirm that the internal methionines of the Rex protein are not crucial to the overall function of Rex , and their loss does not hinder the ability of the virus to productively infect or transform primary T cells in vitro .
DISCUSSION We systematically mutated the Met codons of the HTLV-II rex gene to determine their importance for Rex protein production and function in relation to viral gene expression and transformation .
We confirmed that only the first Met codon is required for Rex regulatory function and that mutation of the internal Met codons did not alter this function .
These results also indicate that p24 ' `` ** translation is not initiated at a Met codon downstream of the initiation of p26rex .
The results presented in this report , which investigated only HTLV-II Rex production and function , are in apparent conflict with earlier studies investigating Rex protein initiation in HTLV-I .
Those experiments identified the initiation sites for the p27 `` ** and p21 ' `` `` * proteins and determined that p21 * was initiated at an internal Met codon ( 29 ) .
This Met codon , which is conserved between HTLV-I and HTLV-II , corresponds to M3 in our studies and did not affect HTLV-II p24'** production .
Two possibilities might explain the dis-crepancy .
The first interpretation is that production of the Rex protein ( s ) differs with respect to HTLV-I and HTLV-II .
The second possibility is that the HTLV-I results may be an artifact of the experimental system , since conclusions were based on analysis of in vitro-synthesized RNA , followed by translation of this RNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate .
Those viral constructs have not been tested directly in cells either by transfection or infection .
Bovine leukosis virus contains a gene analogous to rex , which also codes for two gene products ( 35 ) .
The fact that the smaller rex gene product is conserved between HTLV-I , HTLV-II , and bovine leukosis virus suggests that this gene product plays a role in the viral life-cycle and possibly has a function distinct from the larger protein .
One function of Rex , which has been clearly defined , involves its ability to facilitate the transport of unspliced gag/pol mRNA and singly spliced env mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , resulting in increased Gag and Env protein production .
Mutation of the first rex ATG initiation codon ( p27 ' `` `` * `` / p26 `` ) results in protein loss and function ( 20 , 37 ) .
There is also evidence that Rex has a secondary function in HTLV-II gene expression .
At high concentrations , Rex has been shown to down regulate or inhibit Tax-mediated trans activation .
Mutation of the first rex ATG codon also results in loss of this effect ( 37 ) .
These experiments have not addressed the potential role which the smaller rex gene product plays in overall Rex regulation of viral gene expression .
Our results demonstrate that p24 ' `` ** is not initiated at an internal Met codon .
Two possibilities that could account for the presence of both p26 `` * and p24'** involve posttransla- 4920 GREEN ET AL .
tional modification .
First , p26'* and p24 ' `` * may have the same amino acid composition or backbone and the appearance of p26 * is due to glycosylation or phosphorylation .
The second possibility is that p24'* is a degradation or cleavage product of p26 `` * .
However , our preliminary investigations indicate that p24 `` ** is not derived from p26 `` via proteolysis .
Further analysis of the rex gene will be required to precisely determine the relationship between p26'* and p24 ' `` * .
Once this is determined , one can address whether these proteins are functionally distinct by further mutational analysis of the rex gene and insertion into the HTLV-II infectious proviral clone .
This will ultimately be beneficial to understanding the regulation of HTLV gene expression and its role in disease development .
