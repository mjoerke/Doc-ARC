Thrombin and Thrombin Receptor Agonist Peptide Induce Early Events of T Cell Activation and Synergize with TCR Cross-linking for CD69 Expression and Interleukin 2 Production* ( Received for publication , September 24 , 1993 , and in revised form , December 9 , 1993 ) Bernard Mari , Veronique Imbert , Nathalie Belhacene , Dariush Farahi Far , Jean-Francois Peyron , Jacques Pouysségurt , Ellen Van Obberghen-Schilling ?

Proteolytic activity of the enzyme was required for this effect since diisopropyl fluorophosphate-thrombin failed to increase [ Ca®* ] ) ; .
Furthermore , hirudin and anti-thrombin III inhibited the thrombin-induced [ Ca** ] ; rise in Jurkat T cells .
A synthetic thrombin receptor agonist peptide ( TRP ) of 7 residues ( SFLLRNP ) was found to be as effective as thrombin for [ Ca** ] ; mobilization , and both agonists induced Ca `` release exclusively from internal stores .
Thrombin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins of molecular mass 40 , 42 , 70 , 120 , and 130 kDa .
There was a good correlation between thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter three proteins and Ca* `` * mobilization .
Thrombin and TRP also caused translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the plasma membrane .
As a likely consequence of these events , thrombin activated the nuclear factor NF-kB .
Several cell lines of hematopoietic origin including the leukemic T cell line HPB.ALL and the erythroleukemic cell line K562 were responsive to thrombin , whereas others such as THP1 , a myelomonocytic cell line , and BL2 , a Burkitt lymphoma were refractory to thrombin or TRP stimulation .
The magnitude of the thrombin response in the different cell types paralleled the expression of the thrombin receptor mRNA .
We found that activation of Jurkat T cells by a combination of phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate led to a dramatic inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression and to a concomitant loss of the thrombin response .
Finally , we demonstrate that thrombin and TRP enhanced CD69 expression and interleukin 2 production induced by T cell receptor cross-linking in both Jurkat T cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes .
These findings highlight the role of thrombin as a potential regulator of T lymphocyte activation .
The serine protease a-thrombin ( thrombin ) is generated from the zymogen prothrombin during blood coagulation .

to its role in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin , thrombin exhibits numerous cellular effects ( Shuman , 1986 ) .
It is to date , the most potent stimulator of platelet aggregation ( Berndt and Philips , 1981 ; Siess , 1989 ; Kroll and Schafer , 1989 ) , and other thrombin responsive cells include endothelial cells , vascular smooth muscle cells , and fibroblasts .
Recently , a thrombin receptor belonging to the seven-transmembrane domain receptor family has been cloned by expression in Xenopus oocytes ( Vu et al .
, 1991a ; Rasmussen et al .
, 1991 ) .
Receptor activation occurs through a unique mechanism involving proteolysis by thrombin at a specific site in the N-terminal portion of the receptor , unmasking a sequence which functions as a ligand for the receptor ( Vu et al .
, 1991a , 1991b ) .
Interestingly , synthetic pep-tides corresponding to this sequence mimic the action of thrombin ( Vu et al .
, 1991 ; Vouret-Cravieri et al .
, 1992 , 1993 ; Hung et al .
, 1992a ; Troyer et al .
, 1992 ; Mac Namara et al .
, 1993 ) .
In platelets , thrombin induces the activation of phospholipase C and the subsequent generation of inositol trisphos-phate : and diacylglycerol , which result , respectively , in an increase in intracellular [ Ca*+ ] and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( Siess , 1989 ; Kroll and Schafer , 1989 ) .
In these cells , phorbol esters act in synergy with the thrombin-induced mobilization of [ Ca®* ] ; to induce the full response .
Furthermore , rapid changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of platelets proteins were observed after thrombin treatment ( Golden and Brugge , 1989 ) .
In fibroblasts , G proteins have been shown to transduce thrombin activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C and to induce DNA synthesis in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner ( Chambard et al .
, 1987 ) .
T cell activation also requires two signals , the first one proceeds via the phosphoinositol pathway ( Imboden et al .
, 1985 ) and the second can be delivered by the phorbol ester PMA through activation of protein kinase C ( Davis and Lipsky , 1985 ) .
Similar to platelets , these two signals act in concert to induce T cell activation .
Protein tyrosine kinases of the src family have also been implicated as a primary step of T cell activation ( Veillette et al .
, 1988 ; Samelson et al .
, 1990 ) .
However , the relative roles of G proteins versus protein tyrosine kinases in this process is still controversial ( Harnett and Rigley , 1992 ) .
Although thrombin has been previously reported to be mitogenic for mouse splenocytes ( Chen et al .
, 1976 ) , current knowledge regarding its effects on T cell activation is scant .
In this study , we have focused on the effect of human a thrombin on ' The abbreviations used are : PKC , protein kinase C : PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 18-acetate ; TRP , thrombin receptor peptide ; PHA , phyto-hemagglutinin ; IL2 , interleukin 2 ; mAb , monoclonal antibody .
8517 8518 both short and long term events thought to be involved in T cell activation .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials-DFP , hirudin , and anti-thrombin III were purchased from Sigma .
Highly purified human a « -thrombin ( 3209 NIH units/mg ) was a generous gift of Dr. J. W. Fenton II ( New York State Department of Health , Albany , NY ) .
TRP ( SFLLRNP ) was synthetized by Neosystem ( Strasbourg , France ) .
Cells-The human T cell lines Jurkat , HPB.ALL , K562 , THP1 , and BL-2 were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum , 50 units/ml penicillin , 50 ug/ml streptomycin , 2 mm L-glutamine , 1 mm pyruvate , and 0.1 um 2-mercaptoethanol as previously described ( Auberger et al .
, 1989 ) .
The CD3~ T cell variant was obtained by fluo-rescence-activated cell sorting .
Peripheral Lymphocyte Preparation-Human peripheral mononuclear cells were isolated , under sterile conditions , from leukophoresis samples obtained from the `` Centre de Transfusion Sanguine A. Tzanck `` ( St Laurent du Var , France ) .
Purified T lymphocytes were obtained by rosetting as previously described ( Mari et al .
, 1992 ) .
The purity of the T cell preparation was assessed by both flow cytometry for CD2 , CD3 , CD4 , and CD8 expression and for the lack of CD14 and CD20 expression and finally , by the lack of PHA-induced [ °H ) thymidine incorporation .
Cytosolic Calcium Measurements-Cytoplasmic free calcium levels were determined by using the fluorescent dye indo-1 ( Grienkiewitz ef al .
, 1985 ) and an ATC 3000 cytofluorograph ( ODAM , Wissembourg , France ) , as described elsewhere ( Auberger et al .
, 1989 ) .
Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Immunoblotting-Jurkat cells ( 2 x 10° per condition ) were stimulated for the indicated times with 3 units/ml human thrombin at 37 °C and immunoblotting of protein extracts were performed as previously described ( Imbert et al .
, 1994 ) .
Briefly , cells were lysed and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon membranes ( Milli-pore ) .
The membrane was then saturated and probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine mouse mAb ( 4G10 , U.B.1 . )
at 1 ug/ml for 2 h at room temperature before addition of '**I-protein A and autoradiography .
PKC Translocation-The cells were washed and resuspended in serum free RPMI 1640 and incubated in the presence of human thrombin ( 3 units/ml ) , TRP ( 100 pum ) , or PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) .
Following a 10-min incubation , the reaction was stopped at 0 °C and the cells were pelleted at 4 °C .
T lymphocytes were homogenized and sonicated in a solution ( pH 7.4 ) containing 0.25 m sucrose , 20 my triethanolamine , 2 mm EDTA , 0.5 mm EGTA , 10 ug/ml leupeptin , 10 ug/ml pepstatin , and 1 mm phe-nylmethylsulfonyl fluoride .
The supernatant , obtained after centrifuga-tion at 100,000 x g ( 1 h , 4 °C ) , represents the cytosolic fraction of PKC .
The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 0.5 % Triton X-100 and kept on ice for 15 min .
The 100,000 x g supernatant is referred to as the particulate protein kinase C fraction .
PKC activity was then enriched on DEAE ion-exchange columns for both fractions and measured as previously described using histone HIIIS as substrate ( Tanti et al .
, 1989 ) .
Briefly , assays were performed for 30 min at 20 °C with 100 ul of the indicated fraction in a volume of 250 ul of 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer ( pH 7.5 ) containing [ y-*2PJATP ( 5 uCi ; 50 um ) , 10 mm magnesium acetate , 1 mm CaCl , , and 25 ug of histone HIIIS in the presence or the absence of 24 ug of phosphatidylserine and 1.6 ug of 1,2-diolein ( Tanti et al .
, 1989 ) .
At the end of the incubation , samples were adsorbed on phosphocellulose P81 paper , and extensively washed in 1 % HPO , solution .
mRNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis-Total RNAs were prepared from the different cell lines by acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction ( Chomezynski and Sacchi , 1987 ) .
RNA aliquots ( 25 ug ) were separated on a 1 % agarose gel under denaturing conditions and transferred to a nylon membrane ( Hybond N* , Amer-sham , France ) .
The thrombin receptor cDNA or actin cDNA probes were prepared as previously described ( Rasmussen et al .
, 1991 ) .
Hybridiza-tion was performed overnight at 65 °C and the filters were washed at 65 °C following the procedure of Church and Gilbert ( 1984 ) .
NF-kB Activation-Jurkat T cells ( 10®/ml ) were treated for 1 h with different concentrations of thrombin , TRP ( 100 um ) , or PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) as a positive control for NF-KB activation .
Preparation of cellular cytosolic and nuclear fractions were made by the procedure of Digman ef al .
( 1983 ) , modified by Osborn et al .
( 1989 ) .
Assays were performed using an oligonucleotide with the consensus NF-kB motif ( GATC-CAAGGGGACTTTCCATG ) .
The nuclear extract samples ( 10 ug of pro-tein ) were preincubated on ice for 15 min in the presence of 2 ug/ml poly ( dI-dC ) .
In some experiments , a 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added .

Time course of increase in [ Ca** ] ; induced by thrombin in Jurkat T cells .
Cells were harvested , loaded with indo-1 , and the increase in [ Ca®* ] ; induced by thrombin was monitored as a function of time .
A , time courses of increases in ( Ca®* ) ; at different thrombin concentrations ( 0.1 ( ¥ ) , 0.3 ( A ) , 0.6 ( @ ) , 1 ( 0 ) , 2 ( ® , 3 units/ml ( O ) ) .

Jurkat T cells were preincubated for 5 min in the absence ( 0 ) or presence ( ® ) of 2.5 mm EGTA before the addition of 3 units/ml thrombin .
C , DFP-thrombin fails to increase [ Ca®+* ] ; in Jurkat T cells .
Thrombin was pretreated for 1 h in the presence of DFP ( 1 mm ) ( @ ) or 10 mm ( C ) ) before Ca*+* determination .
Thrombin ( O ) or DFP-treated thrombin was added at zero time .
D , hirudin and anti-thrombin III block the thrombin response .
Thrombin was pretreated for 1 h in the presence of a 2-fold excess of either hirudin or anti-thrombin III before Ca®* determination .
The effect of thrombin ( 0 ) , anti-thrombin III ( A ) , hirudin ( @ ) , anti-thrombin III-thrombin ( 0 ) , and hirudin-thrombin complexes ( BB ) were then monitored .
20 min at 37 °C .
The mixture was separated by electrophoresis on a 6 % ( w/v ) nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel .
The electrophoresis buffer used was 0.25 x TBE .
The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film using intensifying screens for at least 24 h. CD69 Expression-Jurkat T cells ( 10 % /ml ) were incubated in RPMI , 5 % fetal calf serum with or without 10 ug/ml immobilized anti-CD3 mAb ( IOT3 , Immunotech , Marseille , France ) in the presence or absence of 3 units/ml thrombin , 100 um TRP , or a suboptimal concentration of PMA ( 0.5 ng/ml ) for 18 h at 37 °C .
Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline , 0.1 % bovine serum albumin , 0.01 % NaN3 , and resuspended in 100 ul of the same buffer containing a 1:200 dilution of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD69 monoclonal antibody ( Beckton Dickinson ) for 60 min at 4 °C .
After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline , cells were analyzed using an ATC 3000 eytofluorograph ( ODAM , Wissembourg , France ) .
IL2 Production and Quantification-Jurkat T cells or peripheral mononuclear cells ( 10¢/m1l ) were incubated in RPMI , 5 % fetal calf serum and activated with 10 ug/ml immobilized anti-CD3 mAb in the presence or absence of either thrombin 3 units/ml or 100 pum TRP and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C .
Supernatants from stimulated cells were distributed in 96-well microtiter plates in 100 ul of fresh RPMIfetal calf serum before determining the level of IL2 by an enzyme immunoassay as previously described ( Ferrua et al .
, 1987 ) .
RESULTS Thrombin Induces [ Ca `` * ] Increase in Jurkat T Cells-Thrombin was found to significantly and reproducibly increase cytosolic free calcium concentrations in the human T leukemic cell line Jurkat .
Fig .

TRP mimics thrombin-induced [ Ca®* ] ; rise in Jurkat T cells .
A , time course of the TRP effect .
Experimental conditions were described in the legend to Fig .
1 .
Thrombin ( 3 units/ml ) ( @ ) or TRP ( 100 um ) ( O ) was added at time 0 .
B , concentration-response curve for TRP effect .
Cells were loaded with indo-1 and treated with various concentration of TRP .
Fluorescence ratio ( at each concentration of peptide ) were computed every 15 s. The values reported on the figure correspond to a 15-s stimulation .
within 1-2 min .
Thrombin increased [ Ca** ] ; with an EC ; , of 0.3 unit/ml ( 3 nm ) and a maximum at 1-3 units/ml ( 10-30 nu ) ( Fig .
1A , inset ) .
In the absence of external calcium ( EGTA-treated cells ) , the time course of calcium mobilization by 3 units/ml thrombin was similar to that obtained in the presence of external calcium ( Fig .
1B ) .
Thrombin-induced [ Ca** ] , ; increase was strongly inhibited when diisopropyl fluorophosphate ( DFP ) -treated thrombin was used in place of thrombin ( Fig .
1C ) .
Moreover , anti-thrombin III and hirudin , two potent inhibitors of thrombin were also found to block thrombin action ( Fig .
1D ) .
We have investigated the effects of the 7 amino acid N-terminal thrombin receptor peptide ( TRP ; SFLLRNP ) , an agonist of the early ( Vouret-Cravieri et al .
, 1992 ; Hung et al .
, 19922 , 1992b ) and late ( Mac Namara et al .
, 1993 ) biochemical events triggered by thrombin on the Ca** response in Jurkat T cells .
As shown in Fig .
24 , the time course of the increase in [ Ca*+* ] ; triggered by the peptide ( 100 um ) was identical to that induced by thrombin .
The dose-response curve for the peptide 's effect is presented in Fig .
2B .
Maximal stimulation was obtained with 200 um peptide , while the half-maximal effect occurred at ap-proximatively 25 um .
Pertussis toxin pretreatment caused only a partial inhibition ( 20 % ) of the [ Ca®* ] ; increase induced by thrombin or TRP in Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
At the concentration used ( 100 ng/ml ) , Modesto et al .
( 1991 ) have shown that G-protein a subunits were fully ADP-ribosylated in Jurkat T cells .
Thrombin Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Jurkat Cellular Proteins-Fig .
4 shows the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by thrombin in Jurkat T cells analyzed by immunoblotting using - anti-phosphotyrosine - antibodies .
Thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 40 , 42 , 70 , 120 , and 130 kDa .
Phosphorylation was rapid , reaching a peak as early as 15-30 s following thrombin addition .
Differences were , however , observed in the time course of phosphorylation of these proteins .
While phosphorylation of the 70- , 120- , and 130-kDa proteins was transient , returning to basal levels after 1 min and correlating well with the [ Ca # +* ] ; mobilization , phosphorylation of the 40- and 42-kDa proteins remained constant for at least 10 min .
Thrombin and TRP Induce PKC Translocation in Jurkat T Cells-Activation of PKC is associated with its translocation from the cytosol to the cell membrane .
In the experiment depicted in Fig .
5 , the phorbol ester PMA was used as a positive control of PKC translocation .
In nonstimulated Jurkat T cells , more than 90 % of the PKC activity was associated with the cytosol .
A low dose of PMA ( 10 ng/m1 ) induced a redistribution of PKC activity from the cytosol to the membrane ( approxi- 8519 TRP Thrombin 37.5 < I s25 m 3 ~I 9 $ ars A o as & 2245 i i i i i i 0 30 60 90 120 0 30 60 90 120 Time : see Time : see Fic .

Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins by thrombin in Jurkat T cells .
Cells were stimulated for the indicated times with 3 units/ml thrombin .
Proteins from cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon membranes for Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies .
Binding of the antibody was revealed by '* `` I-protein A. mately 50 % in each fraction ) .
Thrombin ( 3 units/ml ) and TRP ( 100 um ) both caused a discernable shift in PKC .
The effect was comparable for each agonist , following 10 min of thrombin receptor activation , cell membrane associated activity reached approximately 30 % of total activity .
Expression of Thrombin Receptor mRNA by Different Hematopoietic Cell Lines-Different hematopoietic cell lines were examined for thrombin receptor mRNA expression .
Fig .
6 shows that a cDNA probe spanning part of the coding sequence of the hamster thrombin receptor hybridized to a unique 3.5-kilobase transcript in Jurkat ( leukemic T cell line ) , K562 ( erythroleukemic cell line ) , and to a much lesser extent in HPB.ALL cells ( immature T leukemic cell line with a prothymocyte phenotype ) .
As previously described , the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line CCL39 which is highly responsive to thrombin expresses considerable amounts of the thrombin receptor transcript ( Rasmussen et al .
, 1991 ; Hung et al .
, 1992b ) .

Northern blot analysis of total RNAs from different hematopoietic cell lines .
Twenty five ug of total RNA from different hematopoietic cells , or 5 ug of RNA from CCL39 hamster lung fibroblasts , were subjected to electrophoresis through 1 % agarose .
RNAs were transferred to Hybond N+ membrane and hybridized to a *°P-labeled thrombin receptor cDNA probe .
Autoradiographs were exposed at -80 °C for 5 days , except in the case of the CCL39 RNA ( 2 days ) .
The arrow indicates the 3.5-kilobase mRNA species corresponding to the thrombin receptor transcript .
We observed that the cell lines expressing the highest levels of thrombin receptor mRNA transcripts also exhibited the more prominent thrombin and TRP-induced increase in [ Ca*+* ] ; ( Fig .
7 ) .
No thrombin receptor message was detected in THP1 ( my-elomonocytic cell line ) or BL-2 ( a Burkitt lymphoma ) cells .
Accordingly , THP1 and BL-2 cells did not respond to either thrombin or TRP ( Fig .
7 ) , although they did display an increase in [ Ca # +* ] ; when stimulated with ATP and anti-IgM receptor mAb , respectively ( not shown ) .
We also found that thrombin-induced [ Ca # +* ] ; was conserved in a CD3-negative variant of Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
We next examined the effect of activation on thrombin receptor mRNA expression in Jurkat T cells .
For this purpose , cells were treated for different times with a combination of PHA and PMA .
Fig .
8 indicates that T cell activation led to a dramatic decrease in thrombin receptor mRNA levels .
This effect was observed as soon as 2 h after agonist addition , whereas virtually no thrombin receptor mRNA was detected after 24 h of treatment .
PMA and I0T3 , an anti-CD3 mAb , also decreased thrombin mRNA expression at 24 h. In order to determine whether the lack of thrombin receptor expression was accompanied by a loss of thrombin responsiveness , control and 24-h activated Jurkat T cells were tested for their ability to increase their [ Ca # +* ] ; levels following thrombin or TRP treatment .
As illustrated in Fig .
8 , thrombin ( 3 units/ml ) or TRP ( 100 um ) failed to induce [ Ca*+* ] ; increase in PHA plus PMA-stimulated T cells , demonstrating that activated T cells become refractory to peptide or thrombin action .

Effect of thrombin or TRP on [ Ca** ] , ; in different hematopoietic cell lines .
The cell lines used were the leukemic T cell line Jurkat ( JK CD3* ) and a variant lacking T cell antigen receptor ( CD3/ TCR ) expression ( JK CD3~ ) , HPB.ALL , a T leukemic of prothymocyte phenotype , K562 , an erythroleukemic cell line , THP1 , a myelomonocytic cell line , and BL-2 , a Burkitt lymphoma .
Cells were harvested and loaded with indo-1 as described above .
Thrombin ( 3 units/ml ) ( @ ) or TRP ( 100 um ) ( O ) were added at time 0 and fluorescence monitored as described above .
found markedly decreased in PMA or IOT3-treated T cells ( Fig .
8 ) .
Importantly , the presence of thrombin receptor mRNA was also detected in nonstimulated highly purified normal T lymphocytes ( Fig .
9 ) .
Similar to Jurkat cells , activation of purified T lymphocytes with PHA plus PMA led to a dramatic decrease in the amount of mRNA transcript .
The amount of thrombin receptor mRNA was barely discernable by 4 h , then returned to the basal level at 24 h but was undetectable after 48 and 72 h of thrombin treatment .
Treatment of Jurkat T Cells with Thrombin or TRP Activates NF-kB-Jurkat T cells have been shown to respond to PMA and tumor necrosis factor by activation of NF-kB and NF-kB-con-trolled genes .
The experiment described below was performed in order to determine whether thrombin or TRP were able to activate NF-kB .
For this purpose , Jurkat T cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of either various concentrations of thrombin ( 0.3-3 units/ml ) or TRP ( 100 um ) .
Nuclear extracts were then prepared and analyzed for specific DNA-binding of NF-kB using electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
As illustrated in Fig .
10 , thrombin induced a dose-dependent formation of a protein-DNA complex ( lanes 24 ) which co-migrated with the complex observed in the presence of a positive control ( i.e .
cells treated with PMA , lane 7 ) .

Expression of thrombin receptor mRNA upon T cell activation .
Higly purified T lymphocytes were stimulated for the indicated times at 37°C in the presence of a combination of PHA ( 10 ug/ml ) and PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) .
RNA samples were prepared as described under `` Experimental Procedures `` and 25 ug were loaded onto a 1 % agarose gel .

TRP ( 100 um ) activated NF-kB to the same extent as thrombin ( lane 6 ) .
Competition analysis performed with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide clearly identified the complex as NF-kB ( lane 5 ) .
Thrombin Acts as an Accessory Signal and Synergizes with TCR Cross-linking to Induce CD69 Expression and IL2 Production-T cell activation is reflected by changes in gene expression .
To determine whether activation of the thrombin receptor has functional consequences on gene expression , we examined the effect of thrombin on CD69 expression and IL2 production .
CD69 expression was assessed by flow cytometry on Jurkat T cells treated for 18 h in the presence of different effectors .
Thrombin or TRP alone did not induced CD69 expression , while PMA or triggering the T cell receptor with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb resulted in CD69 expression ( Table I ) .
Thrombin or TRP synergized with TCR cross-linking to induce CD69 , but not with PMA , indicating that they acted at least in part by the same mechanism as the phorbol ester .
Since IL2 synthesis and production is considered as an index of T cell activation , we next analyzed the effect of thrombin and TRP on IL2 production measured in the presence or the absence of TCR cross-linking .
Jurkat T cells or peripheral blood lymphocytes were stimulated for 18 h with or without 10 ug/ml immobilized anti-CD3 mAb in the presence or the absence of either 3 units/ml thrombin or 100 um TRP .
IL2 production was then measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
Although thrombin or TRP when added alone were unable to induce IL2 production in Jurkat T cells , when added together with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb both agonists significantly potentiated IL2 production in two different experiments ( Table II ) .
The levels of secreted IL2 increased 2-4-fold in the presence of thrombin or TRP , reaching 20-30 % of the maximal response ( anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA ) .
Identical results were found for peripheral blood lymphocytes , ruling out the possibility that thrombin effect may be restricted to leukemic cell lines .
DISCUSSION The action of thrombin on cellular components of the immune system has been poorly documented .
Whereas thrombin has been shown to be chemotactic for monocytes ( Bar-Shavit et al .
, 1983 ) and mitogenic for mouse splenocytes ( Chen et al .
, 1976 ) , information concerning the effects of thrombin on defined populations of T lymphocytes has been lacking .
Thrombin stimulates phospholipase C in a number of cell types via the activation of G-proteins ( Pouysségur and Seuwen ( 1992 ) , for review ) .
This activation results in both an increase in [ Ca** ] ; concentrations , and activation of PKC ( Siess , 1989 ; Kroll and Schafer , 1989 ) .
In Jurkat T cells , thrombin induced a transient rise in [ Ca*+* ] ; .
The effect of thrombin absolutely required its proteolytic activity , since DFP-thrombin had no activity .
Furthermore , the thrombin receptor agonist ( SFLLRNP ) was as effective as thrombin in increasing [ Ca** ] ; in Jurkat T cells , indicating that this effect is mediated by the cloned thrombin receptor .
The effect of TRP on [ Ca®* ] ; increase in Jurkat T cells was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin pretreatment , suggesting that in these cells the thrombin receptor may be coupled to phospholipase C via different G-proteins ( i.e .
pertussis toxin-insensitive and -sensitive ) .
Such a situation has been already reported in CCL39 fibroblasts ( Paris and Pouysségur , 1986 ) and in thrombin receptor-transfected CV-1 cells ( Hung et al .
, 1992b ) .
Our results suggest that in Jurkat T cells , the thrombin 8522 -a- NF-xB -a- NS < - Free probe Fic .

Thrombin and TRP activates NF-kB in T cells .
Jurkat T cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the absence ( lane 1 ) or the presence of either various concentrations of thrombin ( 0.3-3 units/ml ) ( lanes 2-4 ) , TRP ( 100 um ) ( lane 6 ) , or PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) ( lane 7 ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ``
From top to bottom of the gel , arrows indicate the migration of the NF-kB complex , a nonspecifically retarded band , and the free probe , respectively .
Competition experiments were performed with nuclear extracts prepared from cells treated with 3 units/ml thrombin in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled nucleotide ( lane 5 ) .
Tasis I Thrombin and TRP induces CD69 expression in the presence of an anti-CD3 mAb Jurkat T cells ( 10 % /m1l ) were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with thrombin ( 3 units/ml ) , TRP ( 100 um ) , or PMA ( 0.5 ng/ml ) in the presence or the absence of immobilized anti-CD3 mAb ( 10 ug/ml ) .
After three washes , phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD69 mAb was added for 1 h at 4 °C .
Analyses were performed using an ATC 3000 cytofluorimeter ( ODAM ) .

Stimulation of platelets with thrombin increases [ Ca*+* ] ; both by releasing from internal stores and by allowing Ca** to enter the cells .

release from internal stores , whereas the mechanism underlying Ca** entry remains unknown .
Several lines of evidence for the existence of thrombin-activated Ca** channels in platelets have been reported ( Hashimoto et al .
, 1992 ) .
This is not the case in the different hematopoietic cell lines we have tested , since the thrombin effect is entirely accounted for by a release from internal stores .
Production of diacylglycerol and subsequent activation of PKC are also the consequence of phospholipase C activation .
Accordingly , thrombin and TRP induce translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the plasma membrane of Jurkat T cells .
Thrombin stimulation of Jurkat T cells also induces or increases tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins .
Two sets of proteins can be distinguished according to their time course of phosphorylation .
The level of phosphorylation of the 40- and 42-kDa proteins was stable for at least 10 min while phosphorylation of the 70- , 120- , and 130-kDa proteins was transient .
The 70-kDa protein whose phosphorylation parallels the time course of Ca `` * mobilization may correspond to either p70-ZAP or p72 syk ( Chan et al .
, 1992 ; Kolanus et al .
, 1993 ) .
It is noteworthy that p72 syk is tran-siently phosphorylated upon thrombin stimulation of human platelets ( Tanigushi et al .
, 1993 ) .
Nevertheless , direct identification of the thrombin-induced 70-kDa protein as p70-ZAP or p72 syk remains to be established .
Whether or not tyrosine phosphorylation of the 70- , 120- , and 130-kDa protein is a prerequisite for or rather a consequence of thrombin-induced transient Ca*+* increase is not known .
Thrombin receptor is expressed both on a mature ( Jurkat ) and immature ( HPB.ALL ) T cell line .
Interestingly , normal human T lymphocytes also exhibited significant amounts of the thrombin receptor transcript .
The transient thrombin receptor mRNA expression in activated purified T cells may be linked to cell cycle regulation .
Cells expressing the highest amounts of thrombin receptor mRNA showed the highest response to thrombin and TRP , whereas virtually no response was detected in cells negative for receptor expression .
This observation was further confirmed in activated Jurkat T cells , where the diminution of thrombin receptor mRNA expression paralleled the loss of thrombin and peptide response .
Jurkat T cells have been shown to activate the transcription factor NF-kB in response to PMA and tumor necrosis factor .
In a recent report , Trejo et al .
( 1992 ) have demonstrated that thrombin induced a significant increase in AP1-DNA binding activity in human astrocytoma cells as measured by mobility shift assays .
We report in the present study that thrombin and TRP are able to activate NF-kB in Jurkat T cells .
To our knowl- T Cell Activation by Thrombin edge , this observation represents the first example of NF-kB activation by thrombin .
Finally , a major point of interest of our study is that thrombin and TRP can synergize with TCR cross-linking to induce both CD69 expression , an early event of T cell activation and IL2 production in Jurkat T cells , while uneffective alone .
This effect was only observed in experiments designed to mimic `` physiological `` conditions ( in the presence of immobilized anti-CD3 mAb ) .
In these conditions , thrombin and TRP mimicked in part the effect of a suboptimal concentration of PMA .
The observation that thrombin may replace part of the PMA effect is reinforced by the fact that a combination of thrombin and PMA does not induce IL2 production .
Interestingly , it has been described that in a mouse T cell hybridoma transfected with the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase , epidermal growth factor can stimulate IL2 production induced by anti-Thy1 or anti-CD3 mAbs , while epidermal growth factor alone was uneffective ( Kennedy et al .
, 1992 ) .
Conversly , in Jurkat T cells , transfection of the muscarinic receptor leads to carbachol stimulation of IL2 production in the absence of other stimuli ( Desai et al .
, 1990 ) .
It is conceivable that this apparent discrepancy may only reflect differences in the level of expression of both receptors ( endogenous thrombin receptor versus transfected muscarinic receptor ) .
In summary , our data confirm and considerably extend the recently reported observations of Tordai et al .
( 1993 ) that thrombin and TRP induce Ca** mobilization and PKC activation in some T cell lines .
The mechanisms underlying the thrombin response in T cells are currently under investigation .
