The DNA Binding Domain of the A-MYB Transcription Factor Is Responsible for Its B Cell-specific Activity and Binds to a B Cell 110-kDa Nuclear Protein* ( Received for publication , May 7 , 1997 , and in revised form , June 24 , 1997 ) Guo-Guang Yingt , Marcello Arsuraf§ , Martino Introna # 1 , and Josée Golay # | From the { Laboratory of Molecular Immunohematology , Department of Immunology and Cell Biology , Istituto Ricerche Farmacologiche `` Mario Negri , `` via Eritrea 62 , 20157 Milano , Italy and the §Department of Biochemistry , Boston University School of Medicine , Boston , Massachusetts 02118-2394 Expression studies as well as the use of transgenic animals have demonstrated that the A-MYB transcription factor plays central and specific role in the regulation of mature B cell proliferation and/or differentiation .
Furthermore , it is highly expressed in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells and may participate in the pathogenesis of this disease .
We have therefore investigated the transcriptional activity of A-MYB and its regulation in several human lymphoid cell lines using co-transfection assays and show that A-MYB is transcriptionally active in all the B cell lines studied , but not in T cells .
In particular the best responder cell line was the Burkitt 's cell line Namalwa .
The activity of A-MYB in B and not T cells was observed when either an artificial construct or the c-MYC promoter was used as a reporter .
Furthermore , the functional domains responsible for DNA binding , transactivation , and negative regulation , previously characterized in a fibroblast context , were found to have similar activity in B cells .
The region of A-MYB responsible for the B cell specific activity was defined to be the N-terminal 218 amino acids containing the DNA binding domain .
Finally , a 110-kDa protein has been identified in the nuclei of all the B , but not T , cell lines that specifically binds to this A-MYB N-terminal domain .
We hypothesize that this 110-kDa protein may be a functionally important B cell-specific co-activator of A-MYB .
Transcription factors control crucial cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation .
Deregulation of their function or of their expression has been implicated in many hematopoietic neoplasms ( 1 ) .
A-MYB is a member of the Myb family of transcription factors ( 2-4 ) .
All members of the Myb family have been implicated directly in the control of cell growth and differentiation ( reviewed in Refs .
3 and 4 ) : the v-MYB oncogene transforms cells of hematopoietic origin ( 5 ) , its normal cellular equivalent c-MYB is required for hemopoiesis ( 6 ) and B-MYB is involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of many lineages ( 7-9 ) .

Among hematopoietic cells , A-MYB expression is restricted to a narrow window of normal B cell differentiation , taking place in germinal centers ( 10 , 11 ) .
Furthermore it is highly expressed in Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) cells and not in most other neoplas-tic B cells ( 12 ) .
Very recently , transgenic mice expressing high levels of ectopic A-MYB in most tissues have been found to show follicular hyperplasia and enhanced B cell proliferation , demonstrating that A-MYB plays an important and specific role in regulating B cell proliferation and/or differentiation ( 13 ) .
These data as well as its ability to cooperate with c-MYC in promoting entry into S phase ( 14 ) strongly suggest that it is an important factor in the pathogenesis of BL ( 12 , 13 ) .
A-MYB is expressed in few other nonhematopoietic tissues : spermato-cytes , some epithelial cells , and some central nervous system cells ( 2 , 11 , 15 ) .
A-MYB knockout mice show defects in sper-matogenesis and mammary gland formation in agreement with the normal expression pattern of the gene ( 16 ) .
The transcriptional activity of A-MYB and its regulation have never previously been investigated in B lymphocytes , one of the cellular context in which it plays an important function .
Several functional and regulatory domains of human A-MYB have been recently characterized in murine fibroblasts ( 17 , 18 ) .
Amino acids 33-188 contain the three imperfect repeats of 51-52 aa , which form the DNA binding domain ( 19 ) .
The transactivation domain is formed by about 100 aa centered around a stretch of charged amino acids ( aa 218-318 ) .
The C-terminal half of the molecule is inhibitory for both DNA binding and transactivation ( 17 , 18 ) .
In this report we have set out to investigate the activity of A-MYB in B cells .
We show that the A-MYB transcriptional activity can be detected in all B cell lines studied , being the highest in BL cells .
By contrast A-MYB was not active in the T cell lines .
Furthermore we have defined the DNA binding domain of A-MYB as being responsible for its B cell specific activity and have identified a 110-kDa protein present in B , but not T , cells that is able to bind to the A-MYB DNA binding domain .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Lines and Cell Cultures-The Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line Namalwa was a kind gift of Prof. D. H. Crawford ( London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , London ) .
The myeloma cell line IM-9 , the acute lymphoblastic T leukemia line CEM , and the T cell leukemia line Jurkat were from the American Tissue Culture Collection ( ATCC ; Rockville , MD ) .
The BJAB non-Hodgkin lymphoma line was a gift from Dr. Vercelli , Dibit Center , Ospedale San Raffaele , Milan , Italy ) .

Transient Transfections and CAT Assays-Cells were resuspended in fresh medium at a density of 2 X 10° cells/ml 24 h prior to transfection .
For transfections , 5 X 10° cells were incubated for 5-50 min at 87 °C in 1 ml of transfection medium ( culture medium lacking fetal calf serum and containing 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.4 ) ) , containing 150-500 ug/ml DEAE-Dextran ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc. , Uppsala , Sweden ) and 15 ug of plasmid DNA ( 8 ug of B-galactosidase plasmid pON405 as standard , 3 ug of CAT reporter plasmid , and the indicated quantities of the A-MYB expression plasmids and/or empty expression vector ) .
The transfection conditions were optimized for each cell line .
The cells were then washed and cultured in 8 ml of complete medium for 48 h. The harvested cells were lysed by repeated freezing and thawing , and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min .
Equal amounts of total protein , determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay ( Bio-Rad ) , were used for B-galactosidase and CAT assays .
CAT assays were performed using a phase-extraction protocol ( 20 ) .
The CAT activity values were normalized to the B-galactosidase activity .
Plasmid Constructions-The KHK-CAT plasmid was as described ( 21 ) .
The A-MYB wt , pCAD1 , pA1l , and mutant 1 expression constructs have been described previously ( 19 ) and are all subcloned in the pSGS5 expression vector containing the SV40 promoter ( Stratagene ) .
The MYC promoter CAT construct was a kind gift of Dr. L. Lombardi ( Institute of Medical Sciences , Ospedale Maggiore , Milan , Italy ) and contains the human c-MYC promoter from the HindIII site 2.5 kilobases upstream from the first exon of c-MYC , to the Puull site at the end of the first exon , placed upstream from the CAT gene in pSVOCAT .
The GAL4 reporter construct 17MX2-Hc-CAT contains two copies of the GAL4 binding site cloned upstream from the CAT gene ( 22 ) .
The B-galactosidase plasmid pON405 contains the -galactosidase cDNA cloned downstream from the cytomegalovirus promoter .
pGA was generated by inserting the blunted NdeI-EcoRV fragment from A-MYB mutant 1 ( 17 ) in the blunted ClaI site of the pG4M poly II plasmid carrying part of the GAL4 cDNA ( 23 ) .
The construct encodes a hybrid protein consisting of the GAL4 DNA binding domain from aa 1 to 148 fused in frame to the A-MYB transactivation domain from aa 218 to 318 .
The Gal4 DNA binding domain alone ( pG- ) was encoded by the pG4M poly II plasmid ( 28 ) .
pAV was made by first inserting the Xhol-XAol fragment from the plasmid ER ( C ) -VP16 ( 24 ) into the Ndel site of the A-MYB cDNA cloned in the pECE vector and then transferring the complete insert into the BamHI site of the pSGS5 vector ( Stratagene ) , resulting in a hybrid containing the A-MYB DNA binding domain ( aa 1-217 ) fused in frame to the transactivation domain of VP16 ( aa 411-490 ) .
The pGV control plasmid carried the same XhoI fragment of VP16 fused in frame to the Gal4 DNA binding domain encoding aa 1-148 .
A control plasmid carrying only the complete A-MYB DNA binding domain ( pA- ) in pSGS5 was made by carboxy truncation at a mutated BamHI site at aa position 262 ( 17 ) .
The pGST-A-MYB-DBD construct was made by cloning the 650-base pair NdeI fragment from p1500 into the EcoRI site of pGEX-3X ( Pharmacia ) .
This construct encodes the glutathione trans-ferase protein in frame with the A-MYB DNA binding domain ( aa 2-217 ) .
All constructions were verified by sequencing .
Recombinant Protein Production and Purification-Bacteria strain K803 was used for producing the GST and GST-A-MYB-DBD fusion proteins .
After induction for 3 h with 0.1 mM isopropyl-B-D-thiogalacto-pyranoside the bacteria were harvested and resuspended in Solution A ( 50 mm HEPES , pH 8.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol ) plus 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated at room temperature for 10 min .
The cells were treated then by several cycles of sonication on ice , and the lysates containing the soluble recombinant protein were obtained by centrifugation .
The lysates were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads ( Sigma ) for 1.5 h at 4°C , washed three times with Solution A , and either eluted with glutathione or used directly for protein binding assays .
Metabolic Labeling and Protein Binding Assay-10 X 10° exponentially growing cells were cultured for 3 h in methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI medium containing 200 Ci of pro-Mix ( *°8 ) cell labeling mix ( 1000 Ci/mmol , Amersham ) .
Labeled cells were lysed in 200 ul of Buffer 1 ( 20 mm HEPES , pH 8.0 , 25 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl , , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 5 mM dithiothreitol , protease inhibitors ) and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C .
The supernatant contained the cytoplasmic fraction , whereas the nuclear pellet was further extracted for 10 min at 4 °C in 100 l of Buffer 2 ( 20 mm HEPES , pH 8.0 , 1 mM EDTA , 5 mm MgCl , , 0.5 M NaCl , 20 % glycerol , protease inhibitors ) and cleared by centrifugation .
Both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were diluted 1:4 in Buffer 3 ( 20 mm HEPES , pH 8.0 , 1 mM EDTA , 5 mm MgCl , , 20 % glycerol , protease inhibitors ) and incubated with 20 ul of GST-bound glutathione agarose for 1.5 h at 4°C and centrifuged .

RESULTS A-MYB Is Active in B Cells but Not in T Cells-Previously we had characterized the transcriptional activity and several functional domains of the A-MYB protein in transfected mouse 3T3 fibroblasts ( 17 , 19 ) .
Since A-MYB is expressed and shows biological activity in vivo during a narrow stage of B lymphoid differentiation and not in other hematopoietic lineages ( 10 , 12 , 13 ) , we set out to more directly investigate the transcriptional activity and functional domains of A-MYB in human hematopoietic cells .
For this purpose , we used the wt A-MYB cDNA , a C-terminal truncated mutant ( mutant 1 ) , previously shown to be 5-6-fold more active than the wild type in fibroblasts ( 17 ) , as well as two mutants carrying deletions of the previously defined DNA binding and transactivation domains ( pCAD1L and pAl , respectively ) ( 19 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
All constructs were cloned in the pSGS vector carrying the SV40 promoter and expressed comparable levels of nuclear A-MYB protein after transfection in NIH-3T3 cells ( 17 , 19 ) .
The transient transfection protocols were optimized individually for each of a number of hematopoietic cell lines using the DEAE-Dextran technique .
Protocols were found which led to comparable levels of transfection efficiencies in different human T and B cell lines , as measured using both the B-galactosidase and Rous sarcoma virus-CAT reporters ( data not shown and Table I ) .
On the other hand , the maximal transfection efficiencies obtained with several myeloid and erythroid cell lines were at least 10 times lower than those obtained with lymphoid cells ( data not shown ) .
Studies on the A-MYB activity were therefore performed only with the more efficient lymphoid cell lines .

Table I shows the mean activity and standard deviation of several experiments performed with the highest dose of each construct ( 9 ug ) , as well as a measure of the transfection efficiencies obtained for the different cell lines with a constant amount of the Rous sarcoma virus-CAT plasmid .
Out of six different lymphoid cell lines tested ( four B cell and two T cell lines ) , wild type A-MYB was significantly active only in the BL cell line Namalwa , with an up to 40-fold induction of transcription ( Fig .
2 , upper panel , and Table I ) .
The bell-shaped curve evaluable in the dose-response experiment has already been observed in 3T3 cells and is presumably due to a squelching effect ( 18 , 19 ) .
The C-terminally truncated mutant 1 , on the other hand , reproduc-ibly showed transcriptional activity in all B cell lines tested , with a 19-21-fold maximal induction in most cell lines and a stronger activity ( up to 55-fold ) in Namalwa cells ( Fig .
2 , lower panel , and Table I ) .
On the contrary , mutant 1 , like wt A-MYB , did not show any transcriptional activity in the two T cell lines tested and in repeated experiments ( Fig .
2 and Table I ) .
Thus the Namalwa cell line ( a BL ) is the best responder for A-MYB activity .
Mutant 1 is more active than wild type in B cells as previously observed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts , but its activity is cell type-specific , being detected only in B cell lines representative of different stages of differentiation ( BL , NHL , myeloma , and EBV-LCL ) but not in the two T cell lines studied ( one derived from an acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia Amount of Effector Plasmid ( ug ) and the other from a T cell leukemia ) .
To verify whether the specificity of action of A-MYB in B versus T cells can be observed also when using a normal biologically relevant promoter rather than an artificial construct , we have used the c-MYC promoter , which has been shown previously to be induced by A-MYB ( 14 ) .
As shown in Fig .
3 and Table I , A-MYB wt can also activate the human c-MYC promoter by at least 10-fold in Namalwa cells .
As expected , the mutant 1 was more active than wild type on the MYC promoter in the same cells with up to 55-fold activation ( Fig .
3 and Table T ) .
That this activity was dependent on both the DNA binding and transactivation domains of A-MYB was verified using the pAl and pCAD1 constructs , which completely lost activity in Namalwa cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Interestingly , neither the wt A-MYB protein nor the mutant 1 proteins showed any activity in Jurkat cells using the c-MYC promoter construct ( Fig .
3 and Table I ) .
As expected the deletion mutants pAl and pCAD1 were also inactive ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus we conclude that i ) A-MYB is able to activate efficiently the c-MYC promoter in a B cell context , ii ) the A-MYB functional domains previously identified in fibroblasts show similar functions in a B cell context and using a natural and biologically relevant promoter , and iii ) A-MYB is completely inactive in T cells even when using such promoter .
The A-MYB DNA Binding Domain Is Responsible for Its Specific Activity in B Cells-The shortest mutant 1 protein contains only the DNA binding and transactivation domains of A-MYB ( aa 1- 319 , Fig .
1 ) and shows a striking difference in activity in T cells versus B cells using different promoters .
We therefore wanted to further define which of these two domains 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 24924 B Cell-specific Activity of the A-MYB Transcription Factor Namalwa Jurkat so- | -o- _ Wild Type so- , | -O- Wild Type -- - _- Mutant 1 Fic .

Transcriptional activity of the hybrid constructs in Namalwa and Jurkat cells .
The indicated cell lines were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of the indicated hybrid and control constructs and 3 ug of the KHK-CAT and GAL4-CAT reporters , as appropriate .
The data are representative of at least three separate experiments .
O , pAV ; @ , pGA ; M , pGV ; D , pG- ; A , pA- .
Amounts of Plasmid ( ug ) may be responsible for this difference in activity .
For this purpose we constructed two additional mutants , one ( pAV ) containing the A-MYB DNA binding domain only , fused in frame with the VP16 transactivation domain , and the other ( pGA ) containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused in frame to the A-MYB transactivation domain .
As controls , we also used a hybrid construct ( pGV ) carrying the Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to the VP16 transactivation domain , as well as the DNA binding domains alone ( pG- and pA- ) .
All constructs are described schematically in Fig .
1 .
The hybrids were tested in parallel in the Namalwa and Jurkat cell lines using the KHK-CAT reporter or a GAL4 reporter , as appropriate .
As shown in Fig .
4 and Table I , all constructs carrying both a DNA binding and transactivation domain ( pAV , pGA , and pGV ) were active in Namalwa cells ( in a dose-dependent man-ner ) .
On the other hand , only the pGA and pGV hybrids , but not pAV , functioned in Jurkat cells .
As expected , the control DNA binding domains alone ( pG- and pA- ) were inactive in both cell lines against their respective promoters ( Fig .
4 ) .
Thus both the A-MYB and VP16 transactivation domains are functional in Jurkat , when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain .
On the contrary , the A-MYB DNA binding domain fused to the strong VP16 transactivation domain is still inactive in T cells , whereas this fusion construct is active in Namalwa cells ( Fig .
4 and Table 1 ) .
The A-MYB DNA Binding Domain Binds a 110-kDa Protein Specifically Present in B Cells-The above data suggested that either a co-activator is present in B and not T lymphoid cells or that an inhibitor is present in T and not B lymphoid cells and that these putative co-activator ( s ) or inhibitor ( s ) act through the DNA binding domain of A-MYB .
To identify such putative co-activator or inhibitor , we subcloned the A-MYB DNA binding domain fused in frame with the GST protein in a bacterial expression vector .
Expression of this construct ( called GST-A- Amounts of Plasmid ( ug ) MYB-DBD ) was induced in bacteria and the recombinant protein purified on a glutathione column as shown in Fig .
54 .
Finally , metabolically labeled lymphoid cells were lysed , and both the cytosolic and nuclear lysates were passed over the column .
As shown in Fig .
5B , one labeled band of approximately 110 kDa ( indicated with an arrow ) and which specifically binds the A-MYB-DBD is observed in the nuclear lysates of all B cell lines tested ( Namalwa , IM-9 , and EBV-LCL cells in lanes 8 , 12 , and 14 , respectively ) but is not detected in the two T cell lines ( Jurkat and CEM , lanes 7 and 10 ) .
The 110-kDa B cell protein is mostly nuclear and does not bind to GST alone ( lane 4 ) .
Several other bands appear to specifically bind to the A-MYB DNA binding domain , two of which localize to the cytoplasm and two in the nucleus .
These were , however , detected in all lymphoid extracts tested .
The same results have been observed in at least three separate experiments .
We conclude that B cells contain a nuclear protein of about 110 kDa , which specifically binds to the A-MYB DNA binding domain , but is not present in T cells .
This protein may be responsible for the activity of A-MYB in B versus T cells .
DISCUSSION In this report we show that the A-MYB transcription factor is functionally active in human lymphoid B cell but not in T cell lines .
The functional domains previously characterized in fibroblasts ( 17 , 19 ) , in particular the DNA binding , transactivation , and C-terminal negative regulatory domains , appear to have the same function in B cells and also when a natural promoter such as the c-MYC promoter is used as a reporter .
We show that the region responsible for the specificity of activity of A-MYB in B versus T cells is the N-terminal region , which includes the DNA binding domain .
Finally , in an attempt to characterize the molecular reasons for this cellular specificity , we have identified a 110-kDa protein present in the nuclei of all 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog Fig .

4 2 four B cell lines tested , but not in T cells , which binds specifically to the DNA binding domain of A-MYB .
We suggest that this 110-kDa protein may be at least one element responsible for the transcriptional activity of A-MYB in B cells .
Our finding that A-MYB is active in B , but not T , cells is of particular interest in light of the recent report using A-MYB transgenic mice and showing that A-MYB has a strong and specific functional effect on B lymphocyte proliferation and/or differentiation ( 13 ) .
Although these mice expressed the transgene in many tissues , abnormalities were confined primarily to B lymphocytes .
Hyperplasia of spleen and lymph nodes were mostly due to an expanded B cell population showing a germinal center phenotype ( 13 ) .
These data are in line with previous work showing that , among hematopoietic cells , expression of the endogenous A-MYB gene is restricted to the activated B cells present in germinal centers ( 10 , 11 ) .
Furthermore A-MYB expression is also restricted in B cell neoplasms , being found only in BL and some chronic lymphocytic leukemias ( 12 ) .
These data , together , show that A-MYB plays an important functional role during activation and/or differentiation of mature B lymphocytes .
The activity of the Myb family of genes has nearly always been studied in fibroblasts or epithelial cells which are most easily transfected for transient assays ( reviewed in Refs .
3 and 25 ) .
The only other cell type that has been used to study Myb transcriptional activity is the chicken macrophage line HD11 ( 11 , 26 ) .
Thus this is the first report of the study of the activity of a Myb transcription factor in human hematopoietic cells .
Our data show that A-MYB is transcriptionally active in all B cell lines studied and not in T cells .
The cellular specificity of A-MYB transcriptional activity in B versus T cells is of particular interest .
We believe that the difference reflected a true biological property of A-MYB , since it was observed in all the lymphoid cell lines tested , all of which showed comparable transfection efficiencies .
The activity of the A-MYB wt was detectable only in Namalwa cells , which were the best responder cell line also for the stronger mutant 1 .
Interestingly , the Namalwa cell line is derived from a BL patient and A-MYB is highly expressed in most BL cell lines , although the Namalwa line itself does not express significant endogenous A-MYB ( 12 ) .
Furthermore the phenotype of BL cells corresponds to that of normal germinal center B cells , which are the cells that accumulate in the A-MYB transgenic animals .
Activity of the stronger mutant 1 could be detected in all B cell lines , but not in T cells .
This difference could not be due to the levels of expression of the endogenous MYB genes since we found no correlation between A-MYB activity and levels of A-MYB , B-MYB , or c-MYB mRNA or protein in the same cell lines ( 12 ) . ``
For this reason , we have started a molecular characterization of the tissue specificity of the A-MYB gene .
In this report we show that the presence of the first 217 N-terminal amino acids that contains the DNA binding domain is sufficient to give B cell-specific activity when fused to the VP16 transactivation domain .
On the other hand , the A-MYB transactivation domain ( aa 218-318 ) is functional in both T and B cells when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain .
Furthermore , we show in binding assays using bacterially produced GST-A-MYB that all B cell lines tested , but not T cells , contain a nuclear protein of about 110 kDa , which specifically binds to the A-MYB DNA binding domain .
On the basis of these results we hypothesize that this 110-kDa nuclear protein found in B cells is a co-activator of A-MYB function .
We do not know the molecular basis for the higher A-MYB activity in Namalwa relative to other B cells , since equivalent amounts of p110 were detected in all B cell lines ; thus this difference may depend on other factors binding to A-MYB ( 17 ) .
On the other hand p110 may be responsible , at least in part , for the specific functional effects of the A-MYB transgene in B cells .
The confirmation of such hypotheses will require the cloning of this 110-kDa protein , which is under way and is beyond the scope of this paper .
Recently a 100-kDa protein called p100 has been described that binds to the DNA binding domain of c-MYB ( 27 ) .
We have evidence that our 110-kDa protein is not p100 , since p110 did not react in Western blots with an anti-p100 antiserum ( kindly provided by Dr. E. Kieff , Harvard University , Boston ) . ``
Furthermore p100 has been reported to be ubiquitous ( 27 , 28 ) , and its role in regulating c-MYB transcriptional activity is unclear at present ( 27 ) .
It is intriguing that the domain responsible for cell type-specific activity is the DNA binding domain .
We do not know whether the lack of transactivation activity of A-MYB in T cells reflects lack of DNA binding .
The transfection efficiency was too low in either T or B cells to measure DNA binding activity directly .
We therefore investigated whether preincubation of * G.-G. Ying , unpublished data .
610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 24926 A-MYB-transfected 3T3 fibroblast extracts with either T or B cell nuclear extracts affected A-MYB DNA binding .
We did not observe any measurable effect of the extracts on binding . ``
A more detailed understanding of the mechanism of regulation of A-MYB activity will therefore require cloning of the putative co-factors such as p110 involved in this regulation .
This report also shows that the functional domains of A-MYB previously characterized in fibroblasts have the same properties in B cells ( 17 ) .
In particular the transactivation domain of A-MYB has been shown here to be functional also when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain ( from GAL4 ) .
In addition the C-terminal half of the protein shows strong inhibitory activity , reducing transactivation by 2-3-fold in a similar manner to what had been observed in NIH-3T3 cells ( 17 ) .
Furthermore we show here that this effect is apparent also when a natural and biologically relevant promoter is being used as a reporter , the human c-MYC promoter .
Previously the murine c-MYC promoter had been shown to be regulated by A-MYB in smooth muscle cells ( 14 ) .
Interestingly the c-MYC gene is expressed in the centroblasts of germinal center , like A-MYB ( 29 ) , and more importantly is the target of chromosomal transloca-tions in 100 % Burkitt 's lymphomas ; for this reason it is considered as a crucial element in the transformation of such tumors ( 30 ) .
One possible speculation is that A-MYB and c-MYC may amplifiy each other and cooperate in the oncogenic effect ( 14 ) .
In conclusion , the A-MYB transcription factor is expressed and is functional during a narrow stage of B cell lymphoid differentiation and may function in this context by cooperating with B cell-specific co-factors .
This information is reminiscent of what has been previously observed for other transcription factors , which can acquire B cell specificity through interaction with co-factors ( 31-33 ) , and supports the notion that A-MYB plays an important role in the B cell differentiation process itself .
