CHEMOKINES Ligation of CD11b and CD11¢ B ; integrins by antibodies or soluble CD23 induces macrophage inflammatory protein 1 « ( MIP-1 « ) and MIP-1 production in primary human monocytes through a pathway dependent on nuclear factor- B Roger Rezzonico , Veronique Imbert , Rachel Chicheportiche , and Jean-Michel Dayer Chemokines and adhesion molecules such as integrins play a major part in the trafficking , extravasation , and recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites .
This study investigated the effects of B ; integrin engagement on chemokine production by freshly isolated human monocytes .
We found that ligation of CD11b or CD11c but not CD1ia « chains of B ; integrins by antibodies or soluble CD23 ( sCD23 ) fusion proteins rapidly induced transcription and secretion of interleukin 8 , macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) 1a , and MIP-18B .
Because the promoters of these chemokine genes contain « B binding sites , we assessed the possible role of nuclear factor-kB in controlling induction of the genes through B » integrin engagement .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that sCD23 or antibodies to CD11b or to CD1ic up-regulated DNA-binding activity of NF-kB .
Activation of NF-kB was accompanied by degradation of its cytosolic inhibitor IkB- « .
Blockade of depletion of IkB- « by proteasome inhibitors ( proteasome inhibitor | or acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleuci-nal ) led to concomitant inhibition of NF-B DNA-binding activity and expression of MIP-1 « and MIP-1B messenger RNA induced by B ; integrin ligation .
These results suggest that triggering of CD11b or CD1lic B , integrin on primary human monocytes provides activation signals leading to nuclear translocation of NF-kB and subsequent secretion of MIP-1 « and MIP-186 that may have an important role in recruitment of other inflammatory cells during initiation of an inflammatory response .

2001 ; 97:2932-2940 ) ©2001 by The American Society of Hematology Introduction Recruitment of circulating leukocytes to an inflammatory site in response to stimuli such as infectious agents ( viruses , bacteria , and protozoans ) or noninfectious processes ( trauma , autoimmune disor-ders , and ischemia-reperfusion injury ) is a crucial step in the development of both acute and chronic inflammatory responses .
In all these conditions , extravasation of circulating leukocytes requires communication with vascular endothelial cells that in turn depends on an interrelated network of events involving the finely regulated action of inflammatory cytokines ( ie , interleukin [ IL ] 1 and tumor necrosis factor [ TNF ] - « @ ) , adhesion molecules ( notably integrins ) , and chemoattractant cytokines called chemokines .
Chemokines are highly conserved , small , secreted or membrane-bound cytokines with molecular masses of 6 to 14 kd and a characteristic 4-cysteine motif in their amino acid sequence .
! ``
Two main subfami-lies are defined according to the position of the first 2 cysteine residues .
In the CXC ( or a-chemokine ) subfamily , these residues are separated by one amino acid , whereas in the CC ( or B-chemokine ) subfamily , they are adjacent .
The B-chemokines , which include monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) , macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) 1a , MIP-16B , and regulated on activation , normal T-cell expressed and secreted ( RANTES ) molecules , are potent chemotactic agents for monocytes .
* `` The migratory behavior of monocytes in response to a concentration gradient of these soluble chemotactic factors also depends on adhesion molecules , particularly the leukocyte-specific 3 ; integrins .
Integrins are part of a family of heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that recognize a variety of ligands or counterreceptors , including extracellular matrix and cell-surface and plasma proteins , and that consequently control numerous physiologic functions , such as adhesion , locomotion , chemotaxis , and phagocy-tosis.© Expression of B ; integrins is restricted to leukocytes , with distribution varying among leukocyte subtypes .
The B ; integrins share a common B chain ( CD18 ) and have at least 4 distinct « chains noncovalently associated with CD18 : lymphocyte functional antigen 1 ( « B ; CD112 @ /CD18 ) , macrophage antigen 1 ( Mac-1 ; CR3 , CD11b/CD18 ) , p150,95 ( axB ; , CR4 , CD11c/ CD18 ) , and a newly characterized member , opB ; , ( CD11d4/ CD18 ) . ``
'' Interestingly , some chemokines ( MCP-1 , MIP-1 « , MIP-1B , and RANTES ) increase surface expression of CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 on human monocytes .
!
* !
2 The best characterized ligands of CD11a/CD18 are intracellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) 1 ( CD54 ) , ICAM-2 ( CD102 ) , and ICAM-3 ( CD50 ) , all of which are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily . '
'' `` CD11b/CD18 also binds to ICAM-1 and other soluble ligands , including fibrinogen , complement fragment iC3b , coagulation factor X , arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequences , heparin-like glycosaminoglycans , certain forms of collagen , and bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . ``
The functional role and ligands of CD11¢/CD18 have not been well defined but appear to be similar to those of Mac-1 , ie , implicated in adhesion of monocytes to endothelium `` © and binding to iC3b , fibrinogen , LPS , and type I collagen .

BLOOD , 15 MAY 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 10 biologically active soluble fragments ( s€CD23 ) , and this results in generation of a relatively stable 25-kd fragment . ``
CD23 may be involved in a variety of IgE- or CD21-dependent biologic activities , such as cell-cell adhesion , B-cell survival in germinal centers , histamine release from basophils , and regulation of IgE production . ``
'' It was also reported that CD23 is a functional ligand for CD11b and CD11c on human and murine monocytes . ``
`` `` Although B ; , integrins promote cellular adhesion in various immune-inflammatory processes , they also function like most transmembrane receptors that are capable of transmitting outside-in signals elicited by ligand binding and resulting in cellular effector responses .
In monocytes , triggering of 3 ; integrins by monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) or s€D23 leads to production of nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines ( TNF- @ , IL-1B , and IL-6 ) , induction of procoagulant activity , and up-regulation of cell-surface molecule expression .
`` * `` 4 `` Such interactions could play a role in chronic inflammatory diseases , including systemic lupus erythematosus , inflammatory bowel disease , Sjégren syndrome , glomerulonephri-tis , and rheumatoid arthritis , in which increased levels of CD23 have been observed . ``
However , little is known about the intracellular events regulating these cell functions .
Therefore , we previously analyzed the signaling pathways leading to IL-1 B production with B ; integrin engagement on human monocytes .
* Because interaction of monocytes with endothelial cells results in chemokine production , `` `` we here investigated the mechanisms controlling production of MIP-1 « and MIP-1 § ( members of the CC chemokine subfamily ) by primary human monocytes activated through CD11b or CD11c 3 ; integrin engagement .

Proteasome inhibitor I ( PST ) was obtained from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) , human recombinant TNF- « from Biogen ( Cambridge , MA ) , and soluble TNF receptor ( sTNFR ) -p55 from Amgen ( Thousand Oaks , CA ) .
Culture media contained less than 0.15 U/mL endotoxin on chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay .
mAbs and recombinant chimeric proteins Anti-CD11a were from the Binding Site ( Birmingham , United Kingdom ; IgG1 , clone BU17 ) and Pharmingen ( San Diego , CA ; IgG2b , clone G43-25B ) .
Anti-CD11b were from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN ; IgG1 , clone 44 ) and Serotec ( Oxford , United Kingdom ; IgG1 , clone ICRFA44 ) .

The isotype mAb controls were from Pharmingen .
Human recombinant fusion proteins for s€CD23 were the kind gift of Dr M. Bird ( Glaxo Wellcome , Stevenage , United Kingdom ) .
The human fusion protein ZZ-CD23 consists of the lectin domain of human CD23 linked to the protein A IgG binding domain ( ZZ ) and is produced in insect cells as described previ-ously .
* ZZ-CD23 can form oligomers in solution .
For these studies , we used polymeric ZZ-CD23 purified by gel filtration as described previously for mouse ZZ-CD23.° ZZ-P selectin and ZZ-E selectin fusion proteins were used as negative controls in all experiments .
MBP-CD23 chimeric protein consists of maltose binding protein fused to the C-terminal 25-kd form of human CD23 .
It was expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli , purified by affinity chromatog- B » INTEGRIN LIGATION CONTROLS CHEMOKINE SYNTHESIS _ 2933 raphy on amylose resin , and processed to remove endotoxin by repeated passage through Detoxi-gel ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) .
Isolation of human monocytes Monocytes from fresh peripheral blood of healthy volunteers were prepared as described previously . ``
Briefly , peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) isolated by using a Ficoll density gradient were incubated at a concentration of 50 X 105 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % heat-inactivated FCS for 40 minutes at 4°C , with rotation leading to monocyte aggregation .
This was followed by 10 minutes of incubation on ice .
Pellets of aggregated enriched monocytes were separated from nonaggregated PBMC by a gradient using FCS .
Enriched monocyte preparations were further depleted of T cells and natural killer cells by rosetting with neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cells .
Final monocyte preparations routinely contained more than 90 % CD14* cells , less than 1 % CD3* cells , and less than 1 % CD19* cells .
Cellular viability was greater than 90 % on trypan blue exclusion .
Polymyxin B ( 1 g/mL ) was present throughout the isolation procedure and during activation experiments to rule out contamination by low levels of endotoxin . ``
Furthermore , to prevent activation on adhesion , monocytes were cultured and stimulated in polypropylene tubes unless indicated otherwise .
Monocyte activation and measurement of MIP-1 « and MIP-1§6 Freshly isolated monocytes were cultured in flat-bottomed , 96-well tissue-culture trays ( Corning Costar , Kennebunk , ME ) at a concentration of 50 X 10° cells/well in complete RPMI medium in the presence of polymyxin B. Monocytes were cultured for various times in the presence of anti- ; integrin mAbs or recombinant s€CD23 fusion proteins .
Culture supernatants were then tested for production of MIP-l « and MIP-1B by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ; R & D Systems , Abingdon , United Kingdom ) .
The limits of detection were 10 pg/mL and 4 pg/mL , respectively .
RNA extraction and RNase protection assays Human monocytes ( 5-10 X 10° cells ) were starved for 14 hours in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 % FCS in polypropylene tubes ( Falcon ; Becton Dickinson , Heidelberg , Germany ) .
Cells were harvested , resus-pended in 500 wL RPMI and HEPES containing 1 % FCS , and incubated in 2-mL tubes ( Eppendorf , Germany ) at 37°C with or without effectors .
Total RNA was isolated by lysing the cells with Trizol reagent ( Life Technolo-gies ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions and analyzed for the level of expression of MIP-1 « , MIP-18B , IL-8 , and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) messenger RNA ( mRNAs ) by RiboQuant RNase protection assay ( RPA ) using the hck-5 multiprobe template set from Pharmingen .
Briefly , riboprobes were labeled with and hybridized overnight in solution with 1 to 2 ug RNA .
The hybridized RNA was digested with RNase , and the remaining `` RNase-protected `` probes were purified , resolved on denaturating polyacrylamide gels , and imaged autora-diographically according to the RiboQuant protocol .
Western blot analysis Nonadherent monocytes were starved for 14 hours in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 % FCS in polypropylene tubes , and 7 X 10° cells were stimulated for various times in 2-mL polypropylene tubes at 37°C with or without effectors .
After incubation , monocytes were washed twice with 1 mL ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer A , which consisted of 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7.5 ) , 150 mM sodium chloride ( NaC ] ) , 0.8 mM magnesium chloride , 5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) , 1 % Nonidet P40 ( NP-40 ) , 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 15 pg/mL leupeptin , 1 M pepstatin , 1 mM sodium fluorescein ( NaF ) , and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate ( Na ; VO , ) .
The crude lysates were centrifuged at 15 000g for 20 minutes at 4°C , and protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined by using Bradford reagent ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) .
For Western blot analysis , total cell lysates ( 50 jug proteins ) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) and transferred to Hybond electrogenerated chemiluminescence ( ECL ) membrane ( Amersham , United Kingdom ) .
The blots were probed with anti-IxB-a polyclonal antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .

Nonadherent human monocytes ( 7 x 10° cells ) were left untreated or stimulated for various times with the following effectors : anti-CD11b ( ICRF44 , 2 ug/mL ; A ) anti-CD1ic ( BU15 , 2 pg/mL ; B ) , anti-CD1ia ( BU17 , 2 pg/mL ; C ) MBP-CD23 ( 1 pg/mL ; D ) Z2-CD23 ( 1 mg/mL ; E ) , and ZZ-P selectin ( 5 pg/mL ; F ) .
Cells were then harvested and total RNA was isolated and analyzed by RPA for expression of MIP-1 « , MIP-18 , IL-8 , and GAPDH mRNAs .
Results are representative of 2 distinct experiments .
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit antibody was supplied by Dako ( Copenhagen , Denmark ) .
Antibody-bound proteins were detected with the Amersham ECL system .
Autoradiographic results were quantified by densitometric scanning on a laser densitometer equipped with ImageQuant software ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Preparation of nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assays Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Schreiber et al . ``
'' Briefly , monocytes ( 10-15 X 108 cells ) were lysed in 200 uL buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 10 mM potassium chloride [ KCI ] , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.1 raM EGTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 1 mM PMSF , 15 g/mL leupeptin , 1 M pepstatin , 1 mM NaF , and 1 mM Na ; VO , ) containing 0.6 % NP-40 .
The lysates were centrifuged and nuclear proteins were extracted from pellets in buffer B ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , and 1 mM DTT ) .
The specific kB DNA probe ( 5'-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3 ' ) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnol-ogy .
Binding reactions were done with 5 pg nuclear proteins incubated for 25 minutes at 25°C with the radiolabeled xB probe ( 25 000 epm ) in 20 L binding buffer ( 10 mM Tris [ pH 7.5 ] , 60 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM DTT , and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin ) in the presence of 100 ng poly dI-dC and 1 wg sonicated salmon-sperm DNA .
DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 X Tris-borate EDTA .
When indicated , an excess of cold competitor oligonucleotides ( B or the unspecific nuclear factor [ NF ] 1 consensus binding site 5-TTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATAA-3 ' ) was preincubated for 15 minutes with nuclear extracts .
Results Anti-CD11b and anti-CD11c mAbs and sCD23 fusion proteins are potent inducers of chemokine mRNA expression in human monocytes We and others**5848 previously established that ligation of 3 ; integrins at the surface of human monocytes mediates outside-in signaling leading to synthesis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines , notably BLOOD , 15 MAY 2001 « VOLUME 97 , NUMBER 10 IL-1B .
Because monocytes are also an important source of chemokine production , `` `` we here investigated the effects of ( 3 ; integrin engagement on modulation of chemokine expression .
Enriched human monocytes ( 85 % -90 % CD14* cells ) were starved for 14 hours in medium supplemented with 1 % FCS and then cultured under nonadherent conditions in polypropylene tubes for 15 minutes to 4 hours in the presence of either mAbs raised against CD11a , CD11b , or CD11¢ B ; integrin a chains or s€CD23 chimeric proteins .
The concentrations used were those previously found to induce IL-1 production . ``
'' Cells were then analyzed for chemokine mRNA expression by RPA ( Figure 1 ) .
We found that incubation of monocytes with anti-CD11b or anti-CD11¢ mAbs led rapidly to a marked induction of MIP-l « , MIP-1fB , and IL-8 mRNAs .
These were detected after 30 minutes and maintained after 4 hours of activation .
Similarly , stimulation of monocytes by 2 distinct sCD23 fusion proteins , MBP-CD23 and ZZ-CD23 , through CD11b and CD11¢c counterreceptors , resulted in a potent increase in steady-state levels of MIP-la , MIP-1B , and IL-8 mRNAs .
Interestingly , we did not observe induction of mRNAs of MCP-1 or interferon-y-inducible protein 10 ( IP-10 ) , 2 chemokines produced by monocytes under different activation conditions ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , anti-CD11a mAbs and ZZ-P selectin chimeric protein had no effect on chemokine mRNA levels ( Figure 1C and 1F ) , as was already reported for IL-1 synthesis .
* ' The stimulatory effect of B ; integrin triggering on chemokine gene expression was dose dependent ( Figure 2 ) .
Activation of monocytes by anti-CD11b or anti-CD11¢ mAbs stimulated MIP-1a , MIP-1B , and IL-8 mRNAs at concentrations as low as 0.2 to 0.5 g/mL and reached maximal levels at 5 to 10 pg/mL mAbs .
Similarly , chemokine mRNAs were induced at a concentration of 0.1 pg/mL ZZ-CD23 or MBP-CD23 fusion proteins and maximal activation was reached with 2 to 5 g/mL .
These results constitute the first evidence that engagement of CD11b and CD11c is a potent and selective inducer of MIP-1 « , MIP-1fB , and IL-8 mRNA expression in human monocytes .

Engagement of CD11b and CD11c by mAbs or sCD23 fusion proteins rapidly stimulates secretion of MIP-1 « and MIP-1B on freshly isolated human monocytes .
( A ) Human monocytes ( 50 x 10° cells/well ) were incubated for 7 hours in medium alone or in the presence of the following antibodies or recombinant fusion proteins : isotype control IgG1 ( 5 pg/mL ) , anti-CDi1a ( clone BU17 , 5 ug/ml ) , anti-CD11b ( clone ICRF44 , 20 g/mL ) , anti-CD11¢c ( clone BU15 , 5 g/mL ) , Z2-CD23 and MBP-CD23 ( 0.5 g/mL ) , and ZZ-P selectin ( 5 mg/mL ) .
Secreted MIP-1 « and MIP-18 in the culture supernatants were detected by ELISA .
Data are mean + SE values ( n= 3 ) .
Similar results were obtained with anti-CD11a ( clone G43-25B ) , anti-CD11b ( clone 44 ) , and anti-CD11c ( clone 3.9 ) mAbs ( data not shown ) .
( B ) Monocytes were cultured for various times under the same conditions as the experiment depicted in panel A .
Then , MIP-1 « and MIP-16 were detected in the culture supernatants by ELISA .
Data are mean + SD values from triplicate performance of one experiment representative of 2 others ( for each condition , SD was < 5 % ) .
Ligation of CD11b and CD11c B , integrins triggers MIP-1 « and MIP-186 release on human monocytes In light of evidence that adhesion-dependent signaling can , under some circumstances , induce mRNAs without synthesis of the corresponding proteins by monocytes , `` `` we investigated the effects of B ; , integrin triggering on MIP-1a « and secretion in our system ( Figure 3 ) .
Freshly isolated human monocytes constitutively produced low levels of or no MIP-1 « and MIP-1 .
However , after stimulation of monocytes by anti-CD11b mAbs , anti-CD11c mAbs , MBP-CD23 , or ZZ-CD23 for 7 hours , release of high amounts of MIP-la « in culture supernatants was observed ( 6.27 + 0.76 ng/mL , 14.05 + 2.31 ng/mL , 5.15 + 0.82 ng/mL , and 10.66 + 1.85 ng/mL , respectively ; Figure 3A ) .
Under these conditions , MIP-1B secretion was also markedly stimulated ( 3.32 + 0.67 ng/mL , 8.22 + 1.14 ng/mL , 2.55 + 0.64 ng/mL , and 5.64 + 0.2 ng/mL , respectively ) .
Conversely , incubation with either IgG1 isotype control mAb , anti-CD11a mAbs , or ZZ-P selectin fusion protein had no effect on MIP-l « and secretion , thereby confirming that the induction was not due to nonspecific activation through monocyte Fc receptors or mediated by the ZZ motif of CD23 fusion proteins .
Evaluation of the time course of MIP-1 « and MIP-1 f secretion with 3 ; integrin engagement showed that both chemokines were detected as early as 3 hours after stimulation and persisted for more than 24 hours ( Figure 3B and data not shown ) .
Furthermore , these data were consistent B » INTEGRIN LIGATION CONTROLS CHEMOKINE SYNTHESIS _ 2935 with the kinetics of induction of MIP-l « and MIP-1B mRNAs ( Figure 1 ) .
Because monocytes are highly sensitive to endotoxin , we compared the effects of B ; integrin engagement by mAbs or sCD23 fusion proteins on chemokine expression in the presence and absence of polymyxin B ( Figure 4A ) .
Polymyxin B ( 10 pg/mL ) had no effect on MIP-1 « , MIP-1f3 , and IL-8 mRNAs induced by anti-CD11b , anti-CD11c , or sCD23 chimeras , but it strongly blocked ( 70 % -80 % inhibition ) expression of the chemokine transcripts induced by a large amount of LPS ( 200 ng/mL ) .
Engagement of CD11b and CD11¢ on monocytes by mAbs or sCD23 was previously found to trigger release of TNF- « .
`` *+ `` `` *8 Moreover , TNF-a is known to stimulate MIP-1 « synthesis . ``
To rule out the possibility that chemokine production was induced by ( B ; integrin triggering resulting from autocrine TNF- production , we did experiments in the presence and absence of the TNF-u-blocking agent , sTNFR-p55 ( Figure 4B ) .
As expected , sTNFR-p55 totally blocked MIP-l « and MIP-1B mRNA expression induced by soluble TNF-a , but it did not affect expression induced by anti-CD11 mAbs or s€D23 fusion proteins .
Taken together , these results indicate that CD11b and CD11¢ B ; integrin ligation is a A as as am Eaa ab - £88 SY 92 .Y 2 388 39 ?

2936 - REZZONICO etal potent way to activate MIP-1a and MIP-1B expression on human monocytes at both the mRNA and protein level .
The findings also show that this chemokine production is not due to either endotoxin contamination or autocrine TNF-a production .
Activation of NF- « B DNA-binding activity and degradation of IkB-a in monocytes triggered by anti-CD11b and anti-CD11c mAbs or sCD23 chimeras To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which B ; integrin engagement elicits induction of chemokines in monocytes , we investigated the NFs that could control MIP-l « and MIP-1B mRNA transcription .
MIP-1 « and MIP-1 f promoters were cloned , characterized , and shown to contain kB response elements . ``
Therefore , we concentrated on the DNA-binding activity of NF-KB with B ; integrin triggering on human monocytes ( Figure 5 ) .
We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays on nuclear extracts prepared from cells treated with anti-CD11b mAbs , anti-CD11c mAbs , or sCD23 chimeric proteins .
Gel-shift studies using a consensus target sequence for NF- « B revealed a constitutive low level of DNA-binding activity in untreated nonadherent monocytes that was not altered during incubation with anti-CD11a mAbs or ZZ-P selectin .
Interestingly , triggering of CD11b or CD11c by mAbs or sCD23 fusion proteins resulted in a significant increase in NE- « B DNA-binding activity after 30 to 60 minutes of activation ( Figure 5A , lanes 4-7 , and Figure 5B , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
The specificity of the protein-DNA complexes induced by B ; integrin engagement was confirmed by the finding that incubation with an excess ( 50-100 fold ) of unlabeled xB oligonucleotide prevented ZZ-CD23-induced binding to the P-labeled xB probe ( Figure 5B , lanes 5-6 ) , whereas incubation with an NF-1 oligonucleotide did not ( lane 7 ) .
The mechanism underlying NF-KB activation is known .
It involves stimulus-induced serine phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and subsequent proteolysis of NF-KB inhibitory proteins ( IxB ) by the proteasome complex , leading to activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor .
`` *~ `` `` Thus , we analyzed expression of IxB- « protein in the cytosol of monocytes after B ; integrin ligation .
As shown in Figure 6A and 6B , the level of IkB-a decreased rapidly after 15 and 30 minutes of activation with anti-CD11b and anti-CD1llc mAbs , respectively , and then increased again , probably because of IxB- « neosynthesis .
Similarly , the MBP-CD23 chimera induced a rapid and transient depletion of IxB- « ( Figure 6C ) .
Moreover , the IxB-a down-regulation appeared more sustained in cells treated with ZZ-CD23 fusion protein , probably because the concentration used was higher than that of MBP-CD23 ( 5 pg/mL versus 1 pg/mL ) .
In contrast , IxB-a remained stable after 30 minutes of stimulation with 10 pg/mL of either anti-CD11a mAbs or ZZ-P selectin fusion protein ( data not shown ) .
Because NF-kB up-regulates transcription of its own inhibitor , `` ® we next preincubated monocytes with cycloheximide to prevent new IxB-a « synthesis .
Under these conditions , depletion of IxB- « induced by anti-CD11b and anti-CD1l1c mAbs or sCD23 fusion proteins was more pronounced and prolonged .
Proteasome inhibitors prevent NF-xB activation mediated by B2 integrin ligation Inhibitors of the proteasome complex block IB degradation and are therefore potent NF- « B inhibitors . ``
'' `` `` However , proteolysis-independent pathways for NF-kB activation have also been observed . ``
Therefore , we investigated whether 2 proteasome inhibi-tors , PSI and ALLN , would affect NF-KB activation induced by B ; integrin engagement .

activation is a prerequisite for CD11b and CD11c signaling of MIP-1 « and expression in monocytes To determine the role of the NF- « B pathway in controlling MIP-1a and MIP-1 f up-regulation induced by CD11b or CD11¢ triggering , we assessed the effects of proteasome inhibitors on expression of chemokine transcripts ( Figure 8 ) .
Preincubation of monocytes with 40 uM PSI abrogated or strongly decreased expression of MIP-la and MIP-1f induced by anti-CD11b and anti-CD11lc mAbs or sCD23 fusion proteins ( Figure 8A , 8C , and 8D ) .
At the highest concentration used ( 100 M ) , ALLN markedly inhibited MIP-la and MIP-1fB gene expression on B ; integrin engagement ( Figure 8B , 8C , and 8D ) .
Both PSI and ALLN appeared to be more effective in blocking induction of steady-state mRNA levels of MIP-1f than those of MIP-1 « .
The constitutive level of GAPDH mRNA was not altered under these conditions .
Interestingly , IL-8 mRNA was not inhibited by PSI or ALLN ; instead , it tended to be potentiated by them .
Taken together , these results indicate that activation of NF-KB is mandatory for up-regulation of MIP-1B gene expression and , to a lesser extent , MIP-la gene expression with CD11b and CD11c 3 ; integrin engagement .
Discussion Numerous proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes , as well as genes not known to be related to immunity , are likely to be regulated in response to engagement of integrins .
Growing evidence supports the idea that in addition to their crucial function in cell-adhesion reactions during immune-inflammatory mechanisms , B ; integrins also generate outside-in cellular signaling that leads to cell activation .
We demonstrated previously that triggering of CD11b or CD11¢c a chains of B ; integrins by mAbs or chimeric sCD23 on freshly isolated human monocytes rapidly activates signaling pathways of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and p38-stress-activated protein kinase 2 that cooperate in controlling IL-1 B production . ``
'' Our current results provide new evidence that CD11b and CD11c engagement can also have a profound effect on chemokine release and consequently on recruitment of inflammatory cells during initiation of an inflammatory response .
Many studies have established that chemokines not only induce leukocyte migration but that they also facilitate leukocyte adhesion , particularly through their stimulatory effect on cell-surface expression and avidity of both CD11b and CD11¢ but not CD11a.126263 Conversely , interaction of monocytes with endothelial cells , plate-lets , or fibroblasts was reported to increase production of chemokines , particularly MIP-1 « .
`` `` * `` `` However , the identity of the adhesion molecules expressed on monocytes and responsible for contact-induced chemokine secretion has not been determined .
In the current study , we found that direct triggering of CD11b and CD11¢ but not CD11a a chains of ; integrins on primary human monocytes stimulated synthesis of IL-8 , MIP-1a , and MIP-1f .
IL-8 production was previously reported to be enhanced through B ; integrin aggregation on human polymorphonuclear neutrophils . ``
The current study is the first to show that ligation of CD11b or CD11c by mAbs up-regulates MIP-l « and MIP-18B expression and secretion on primary human monocytes .
Our findings also indicate that the stimulation of MIP-1 « and MIP-1B production by anti-CD11b and anti-CD11¢ mAbs is physiologi-cally relevant , since such stimulation can also be produced by the natural ligand of these integrins , s€D23 .

Interestingly , the chemokine production induced by CD11b or CD11¢ ligation was selective for MIP-1 « , MIP-1f3 , and IL-8 , since it did not take place on several other CC or CXC chemokines , including MCP-1 , RANTES , and IP-10 .
As in our study of IL-1 } production , `` we can here rule out the possibility that endotoxin contamination contributed to activation of expression of the MIPs , since addition of polymyxin B sulfate , which binds to and neutralizes did not reduce the stimulatory activities of anti-CD11b and anti-CD11c mAbs or s€D23 fusion proteins but did markedly block the effect of 200 ng/mL LPS .
Proinflammatory cytokines , particularly IL-1 and TNF- « , are potent inducers of in vitro and in vivo MIP-la « production on several cell types , including peripheral blood monocytes , alveolar macrophages , inflammatory fibroblasts , and osteosarcoma cells . ``
Furthermore , we and found that engagement of B ; integrins by different methods , including binding to specific mAbs , adherence to surface coated with fibrinogen , incubation with s€D23 , and direct contact with T cells , plays an important role in the production of IL-1 and TNF- « on monocytes .

In monocytes , induction of genes expressing inflammatory mediators such as adhesion molecules , cytokines , and chemokines is regulated partly by members of the NF- « kB-Rel family of transcription factors .
Furthermore , NF-kB was reported to control transcription of MIP-1 « and IL-8.5 > `` Thus , the aim of our study was to assess the role of the transcription factor NF- « B in the control of MIP-1a « , MIP-1f3 , and IL-8 expression in response to ligation of 3 ; integrins on primary human monocytes .
We demonstrated for the first time that specific engagement by mAbs of CD11b or CD11¢ but not CD11a on nonadherent human monocytes induced nuclear translocation of NF-kB .
These results are in agreement with previous studies showing that fibrinogen activates NE- « B transcription by signaling through CD11b-CD18 in U937 monocytic leukemia cells . ``
To our knowledge , our study is the first to show that stimulation of human monocytes by sCD23 leads to activation of NF-kB .
In addition , using the proteasome-specific inhibitors PSI and ALLN to block NF- « B activation , we found new evidence of the importance of this transcription factor in the control of MIP-1B expression and , to a lesser extent , MIP-1 « expression induced by ligation of CD11b or CD11c .

'' Chemokines have been found in tissues in several pathologic conditions characterized by distinct leukocytic infiltrates , including rheumatoid arthritis , sepsis , atherosclerosis , asthma , psoriasis , ischemia-reperfusion injury , and many pulmonary disorders .
! ``
MIP-1a and MIP-1f are particularly elevated in synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis , respectively , and may consequently play a role in recruiting monocytes to inflamed joints .
`` * `` `` Furthermore , MIP-1 « is produced by osteo-blasts and stimulates the motility of osteoclasts , which could in turn modulate bone resorption in inflammatory disorders .
`` > `` * On the other hand , high levels of s€D23 have been detected in serum and synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and associated with worsening of the disease . ``
'' Synovial macrophages also express high levels of CD23 and its counter-ligands CD11b and These data suggest that an interaction of sCD23 or CD23 expressed on macrophages with CD11b or CD11¢ could play a major part in production of MIP-1 « and MIP-1 f in the joint and may therefore constitute an important mechanism sustaining continuous recruitment of inflammatory cells and maintaining chronic inflammation .
Thus , further understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control production of chemokines induced by f ; integrin B » INTEGRIN LIGATION CONTROLS CHEMOKINE SYNTHESIS - 2939 engagement may lay the foundation for new anti-inflammatory treatments .
Two major strategies for inhibiting chemokine activity to limit leukocyte migration in chronic inflammatory diseases have been proposed-one involving the use of antiligand and the other the use of antireceptor . ``
'' An alternative approach , blockage of leukocyte-adhesion mechanisms , is also being tested in Chemokine activities could also be modulated by interfering in signal-transduction pathways , eg , by blocking NF-kB by adenoviral infection with IkB-o.8¢88 In conclusion , this study identified a novel link between CD11b and CD11c B ; integrins and expression of MIP-l « and MIP-1f chemokines in monocytes .
The results extend previous findings on the important role of these adhesion molecules in regulating host immune defense mechanisms and inflammatory processes .
