Lt-4 reacted with all HTLV-I-bearing cell lines tested and five out of eight simian cell lines bearing STLV-LI , but not with an HTLV-II-bear-ing cell line .
Lt-4 detected 40 kd tax , antigen molecules in most HTLV-I-bearing cell lines except one cell line that expressed 39 kd tax , antigen .
In the STLV-I-bearing T cell lines , tax , -related antigen molecules detected by Lt-4 were heterogeneous , having molecular weights in the range of 36-41 kd .
Key words : Human T cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I } ® is a C-type retrovirus etiologically associated with a human malignant T cell disorder , adult T cell leukemia ( ATL } .
* `` The HTLV-I genome contains open reading frames for viral structural components , gag , pol and eny and a unique sequence termed pX encoding three non-structural proteins . ``
One antigen called p40 `` , or tax , antigen , acts as a frans-activator ( tax ) of the HTLV-I long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and has been suggested to be involved in transformation and immortalization of normal T cells infected with HTLV-I , because the tax ; antigen activates the cellular genes encoding interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and IL-2 receptor which are essential for T cell growth . ``
'' Natural antibodies to HTLV-I gag and/or eny antigens are found in almost all sera from HTLV-I-infected humans , `` ~ `` whereas anti-tax , antibodies are found in only one-third of the sera . '
'' Although the protein structure of the tax , antigen has been deduced from the nucleotide sequence , `` little is known about its antigenic structure .
With antisera against synthetic peptides , it was shown that the tax ; antigen expressed antigenic determinants in the C- and/ or N-terminal regions which cross-reacted with other tax antigens encoded by other retroviruses of the HTLV-I > To whom all correspondence should be addressed .

The putative tax antigens of some strains of STLY-I and the tax antigen of HTLV-II ( tax ; ) were shown to be protein molecules of about 41 kd `` `` and about 38 kd , respec-tively . ``
'' `` However , no report has compared the tax antigen molecules expressed in various cell lines bearing HTLV-I , STLYV-I and HTLV-II by using either monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs } * `` or monospecific antisera to tax antigen peptides .
To study further the antigenic structure of the tax ; antigen , preparation of mAbs against various epitopes of the antigen is essential , but a library of mAbs to the tax ; antigen has not been established .
Recently we succeeded in the preparation of a mAb reactive with the tax ; antigen , Lt-4 , from mice immunized with purified native tax ; antigen . ``
'' The present study was designed to determine the Lt-4 reactivity with various cell lines expressing transactivator antigens of HTLV-I , STLYV-I and HTLYV-II , because such studies may be helpful in revealing the antigenicity of not only the tax , antigen but also the tax antigens encoded by STLV-I and HTLV-II .
In the present study , we found that Lt-4 reacted with all HTLYVY-I-bearing cell lines tested and detected 40 kd tax , antigen molecules in the cell lines except one that expressed 39 kd tax , antigen .
Lt-4 also reacted with some STLYV-I strain-bearing cell lines , but not with an HTLYV-II-bearing cell line .

81 , March 1990 tax-related antigen molecules expressed in the STLY-I-bearing cell lines were heterogeneous .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines The cell lines bearing HTLV-I , STLY-I and HTLV-II are listed in Table I .
These cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10-15 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin , in the presence or absence of 20 units/ml human recombinant IL-2 ( Shionogi , Osaka ) at 37°C in 5 % CO ; in humidified air , .
These cell lines were passaged twice a week .
Monoclonal antibodies - HTLYV-I-specific mAbs used were GIN-14 , anti-gag p19 ; NOR-1 , anti-gag p24 ; FR-45 , anti-gag p15 and TA-21 , anti-env gp21 .
`` `` ~ `` `` A mouse IgG mAb , Lt-4 , was prepared recently from mice immunized with affinity-purified tax ; , antigen from an HTLV-I-bearing cell line by using rabbit IgG anti-tax ; peptide , and was determined to be specific for human HTLV-I-bearing T cell lines and to recognize the tax ; antigen , p40* .
* `` Immunofluorescence - Cells were smeared onto glass slides , fixed with methanol , and stained by an indirect immunofluorescence ( IF ) method using mAbs and FITC-labeled goat IgG anti-mouse IgG ( Cappel , PA ) as the secondary reagent .
Immunoblot - Immunoblot assays were performed as described previously . ``
Briefly , cell lysates , which were obtained by lysis of cells with a low salt extraction buffer ( 10 m¥ Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , containing 0.14 M NaCl , 3 mM MgCl , , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 2 mM phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride , and 0.5 % NP4O0 ) on ice for 20 min , followed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 10 min at 4°C , were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10 % separation gels , and blotted electrophoretically onto blot sheets ( Clear Blot P membrane , Atto Corp. , Tokyo ) .
The sheets were blocked with Block Ace ( Dainippon Pharmaceutical Corp. , Osaka ) at 4°C overnight , incubated with various antibodies diluted with PBS containing 10 % Block Ace at room temperature for 45 min , and washed three times with PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 .
Bound antibodies were visualized by a modification of Manson 's method `` `` using a soluble immuncocomplex of peroxidase with rabbit anti-peroxidase serum ( PAP , Dako , Denmark ) ( PAP method ) .
Radio-immunoprecipitation - Analysis of antigen molecules was also performed by radio-immunoprecipitation as described previously . ``
'' Briefly , 1X10° cells resus-pended in 1 rol of RPMI medium without cysteine were incubated with 100 Ci of *S-cysteine ( specific activity 1250 Ci/mmol , Amersham Japan ) at 37°C for 4 h , washed three times with ice-cold PBS , and then lysed in 1 mi of the low salt extraction buffer .

To determine whether tax ; -related antigens recognized by Lt-4 are expressed in cell lines bearing HTLV-I-related viruses , STLV-I and HTLV-II , we screened a variety of simian T cell lines established from simians naturally infected with various strains of STLY-I , and a human T cell line bearing HTLV-II , Ton-l. An immunofluorescence assay showed that while all of the cell lines tested were stained by mAbs against HTLV-I gag antigens ( p19 , p24 and/or p15 ) and HTLV-I env gp21 antigen , only four STLV-I-bearing cell lines , ChM114-1 , GMO0650 , Kanil1l-6 and PtM-3 , were stained by Lt-4 ( Table II ) .
To examine further the Lt-4 reactivity and to identify Lt-4-reactive antigen molecules , immunoblot assays were performed ( Fig .
3 ) .
Lt-4 detected antigens with apparent molecular weights of 41 , 40 , 38 and 36 kd in the cell lysates from ChM114-1 , GMO650 , Kani 11-6 and PtM3 cell lines , respectively .

There was no apparent difference in the molecular weight of the mature core antigen , p34 , expressed in the T cell lines tested .
The data of Fig .

DISCUSSION The present study showed that : ( 1 ) mAb Lt-4 directed against the tax , antigen detected 40 kd antigen molecules in most HTLYV-I-bearing cell lines except our HUT-102 cell line ; ( 2 ) Lt-4 also reacted with some but not all STLV-I-bearing T cell lines established from monkeys naturally infected with various strains of STLY-I ; ( 3 ) Lt-4 reactive antigens in the STLV-I bearing cells were hetrogeneous in molecular weight ; and ( 4 ) Lt-4 did not react with the HTLV-I tax ( tax ; ) antigen .
The reasons why our HUT1O2 cell line synthesized 39 kd tax , antigen molecules are not known .
This is not unique to our HUT1O2 cell line since an HUT1O2 cell line Table II .

maintained in another laboratory also synthesized a similar 39 kd tax , antigen ( Drs .
Nyunoya and Shimotohno , personal communication ) .
It is possible that there is either a deletion of amino acids or an aberrant post-translational modification of the tax ; antigen molecule in the HUT 102 cell lines .
Sodroski et al . ``
observed a heterogeneity of the tax ; antigens in some HTLY-I-immor-talized human cell lines , and they speculated that there might be a variation in the amino terminus of the tax , or post-transcriptional modifications of the tax , antigen in the cell lines .
Recently , it was reported that the tax ; antigen was phosphorylated when the antigen was produced with a baculovirus vector in lymphoid cells `` `` and insect cells . ``
The Lt-4-reactive tax ; -related antigens expressed in STLYV-I bearing cells may be identical or related to transactivator antigens encoded by STLY-I pX gene .
If this is the case , since each of the STLYV-I strains was suggested to have diverged separately after divergence from there may have been alteration in the trans-activator gene of each STLV-I strain during evolu-tion , which may explain both the different reactivity of Lt-4 with the panel of STLV-I-bearing cell lines and the heterogeneity in molecular weight of the Lt-4-reactive antigens among STLV-I-bearing cell lines .
It has been Heterogeneity of tax Antigen Molecules Table III .

'' That Lt-4 reacted with 2 out of 2 cell lines bearing the African subtype STLV-I strains , but only 3 out of 6 cell lines bearing the Asian subtype STLY-I strains , may suggest that the Lt-4-reactive antigenic epitope is conserved better in the African subtype STLY-I strains thar in the Asian subtype STLY-I strains .
The present study also showed that Lt-4 had a different specificity from other monospecific antisera prepared against various tax , peptides or a fused protein : ( 1 ) antisera against tax , peptides , OP-1 and OP-4 corresponding to N- and C-terminal regions of both the tax ; and tax ; antigens , respectively , reacted both with tax , and tax ; antigens `` ' `` ; and ( 2 ) antiserum against bGH-p407 , that covers 54 amino acids located at the C-terminus of the tax , antigen , reacted with the tax ; but not with tax ; antigen . ``
However , this antiserum also reacted with the BMS cell line , `` `` with which Lt-4 did not react .
Thus , it appears that the tax , antigen contains at least four antigenic determinants recognized by antibodies .
