Recently , its presence has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions .
In this study , we characterized C. preumoniae-mediated activation of endothelial cells and demonstrated an enhanced expression of endothelial adhesion molecules followed by subsequent rolling , adhesion , and transmigration of leukocytes ( monocytes , granulocytes ) .
These effects were blocked by mAbs against endothelial and/or leukocyte adhesion molecules ( , and B , integrins ) .
Additionally , activation of different signal transduction pathways in C. preumoniae-infected endothelial cells was shown : protein tyrosine phosphorylation , up-regulation of phosphorylated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase , and activation/translocation occurred within 10-15 min .
Increased mRNA and surface expression of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 were noted within hours .
Thus , C. preumoniae triggers a cascade of events that could lead to endothelial activation , inflammation , and thrombosis , which in turn may result in or may promote atherosclerosis .
lular bacterium , is a widespread respiratory pathogen causing pneumonia , bronchitis , sinusitis , and pharyngitis ( 1-3 ) .
Recently , chronic C. pneumoniae infection has been suggested as a trigger and promoter of inflammatory reactions and development of vascular lesions .
This notion is supported by the demonstration ( electron microscopy , immunocytochemistry , PCR ) of C. pneumoniae in atherosclerotic plaques and the serological association between C. pneumoniae infection and coronary heart disease ( 4-8 ) .
The role of C. pneumoniae in atheroma formation has not been studied in detail .
Monocytes , macrophages , and smooth muscle cells have been shown to be susceptible for C. preumoniae infection ( 9-11 ) .
Chlamydiae may reside and replicate in monocytes/ macrophages and induce a chronic immune activation resulting in TNF-a , IL-1 3 , IL-6 , and IFN-y release as well as up-regulation of CD14 ( 12 , 13 ) .
Little is known about C. preumoniae-induced endothelial cell alterations and C. preumoniae-mediated interactions among all cell types involved in the progress of atherosclerosis .
Airway-derived organisms may be able to spread systemically via at least two different ways : 1 ) carried within monocytes following pulmonary infection or 2 ) by direct access to the blood stream causing a short interval of chlamydial bacteremia .

Adhkesion of circulating leukocytes to endothelial cells is an early step in an inflammatory reaction that is regulated by a complex communication between the cell types involved .
Recent studies revealed that multiple receptor-ligand pairs act sequentially and in an overlapping manner to effect initial attachment , rolling , firm adhesion , and finally transmigration of leukocytes ( 14-16 ) .
For leukocyte adhesion to activated endothelial cells , separate receptor-ligand pairs are involved : ICAM-1 and $ ; , integrins ( CD11a/ CD18 , CD11b/CD18 ) , VCAM-1 and very late Ag-4 ( VLA , ) , `` P-selectin and P-selectin-glycoprotein ligand-1 , E-selectin and E-selectin ligand-1 , as well as sialyl Lewis* and related carbohydrates on leukocytes ( 14 , 17-19 ) .
Therefore , the first objective of the present study was to assess C. pneumonia 's capability to infect and activate HUVEC and human aortic endothelial cells ( HAEC ) .
Enhanced expression of endothelial adhesion molecules was accompanied by an increased rolling , adhesion , and transmigration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMN ) and monocytes .
These effects were reduced by mAbs directed against different adhesion molecules on leukocytes and/or endothelial cells .
There is limited knowledge of the mechanisms of C. preumoniae entry into endothelial cells .
The chlamydial growth cycle is initiated when an infectious elementary body ( EB ) attaches to a susceptible target cell , promoting entry into a host cell-derived phagocytic vesicle .
EB develop into reticular bodies , a process that could be detected metabolically within 15 min and microscopically 12-15 h after addition of Chlamydiae to HEp-2 and Hela-229 cells ( 20 , 21 ) .
The length of the complete developmental cycle , as studied in cell culture models , is 48-72 h ( 22-24 ) .

Therefore , the second objective of the present study was to assess C. preumoniae 's capability to activate host cell signal transduction pathways .
C. pneumoniae induced an immediate increase of total protein tyrosine phosphorylation in HUVEC and HAEC , especially of phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK and an activation/translocation of endothelial cell NF- « B with subsequently increased transcription and translation of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 .
Overall , the data presented indicate that C. pneumoniae can infect and activate human endothelial cells and suggest that C. pneumoniae-induced endothelial cell alterations may promote atherosclerosis .

Results C. pneumoniae strain GiD infects human endothelial cells C. pneumoniae has been demonstrated to infect and thereby activate human endothelial cells ( 10 , 11 , 39 ) .
To investigate leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction , we infected HUVEC with the recently described C. pneumoniae strain GiD ( 31 ) .
GiD turned out to be a highly effective Chlamydia strain and was able to replicate and to form inclusions in HUVEC with a mean titer of 2.6 X 10° IFU/ml as compared with growth in cyclohexamide-treated HEp-2 cells at a mean titer of 6.5 X 10° IFU/ml .
Inclusions were visualized using a FITC-conjugated genus-specific mAb ( Chlamydia FIGURE 1 .
Infection of endothelial cells increased monocyte rolling , adhesion , and transendothelial migration .

C. pneumoniae-mediated leukocyte endothelial cell interaction To investigate C. preumoniae-mediated leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction , HUVEC were stimulated with different concentrations of strain GiD .
Intracellular infection resulted in a profound cell activation with subsequently enhanced leukocyte rolling , adhesion , and transmigration .
Inactivation of bacterial LPS by pretreatment of C. pneumoniae with polymyxin B ( 10 pg/ml ) had no effect on leukocyte-HUVEC interaction .
Killing of C. pneumoniae by heating ( 90°C , 60 min ) reduced chlamydial-mediated effects almost completely ( data not shown ) .
Monocyte rolling on the C. preumoniae-infected endothelial cell monolayer was significantly increased after 4 h and 24 h ( Fig .

Leukocyte rolling after 4 h was reduced by a mAb against endothelial E-selectin ( 56 % ) .
mAb directed against CD11b/18 or CD49d on monocytes and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells were ineffective at that time point .
After 24 h of C. pneumoniae infection , preincubation of endothelial cells with anti-VCAM-1 as well as monocytes with anti-CD49d diminished leukocyte rolling by 55 and 70 % , respectively , whereas Abs directed against CD11b/18 or E-selectin were ineffective .
Furthermore , intracellular infection of HUVEC dose- and time-dependently increased leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells with maximal effects seen at the concentration of 6.5 X 10° IFU/ml .
Adhesion increased after 2 h and remained elevated up to 72 h ( Fig .

Infection of HUVEC and HAEC with C. pneumoniae dose- and time-dependently increased expression of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 ( Fig .
2 ) on endothelial cells ( HUVEC and HAEC ) .
Maximal effects in this study occurred in the presence of 6.5 X 10* IFU/ml ( HAEC , data not shown ) .
E-selectin expression in C. preumoniae-stimulated endothelial cells increased 2 h postinfection , peaked at 4 h , and declined to almost baseline after 18-24 h. Even the lowest Chlamydia concentration tested was able to induce a significant E-selectin response ( Fig .
2a ) .
ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 surface expression in C. pneumoniae stimulated cells increased 4-8 h postinfection , peaked at 12-24 h ( HUVEC ) and persisted up to 72 h ( Fig .
2 , c and e ) .
Compared with HUVEC , the kinetics of the ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 response in HAEC were delayed , and absolute levels of protein expression diminished .
Northern blot analysis of C. pneumoniae-pretreated HUVEC Northern blot analysis was performed to verify mRNA up-regulation for E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 ( Fig .

Role of NF-KB in C. pneumoniae-mediated endothelial cell activation Previous studies have elaborated the importance of NF- « B for the regulation of the transcriptional activities of the E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 genes ( 40 ) .
Multiple NF-kB binding sites have been located in the promoters of all three genes ( 41-43 ) .
NF- « B activation in C. preumoniqe-infected endothelial cells was demonstrated by the enhanced binding-capacity of NF-KB to corresponding consensus oligonucleotides using band shift assays ( Fig .
4a ) .
This point was verified by immunofluorescence , which indicated increased NF-KB translocation within 15-30 min of C. pneumoniae stimulation with maximal effects after 30 min ( Fig .
4¢ ) .
NF- « B activation was confirmed by enhanced NF- « B-dependent transcription of a luciferase-gene transiently transfected into HUVEC ( Fig .
4b ) .
HUVEC were transiently transfected for 2 h with 2 ug NF- « B-luciferase plasmid ( pGL3.BG.6kB ) , stimulated , and harvested in reporter lysis buffer after 4 h. NF-KB activity ( indicated as chemiluminescence/ug protein ) increased dose-dependently in C. preumoniae-stimulated endothelial cells .

C. pneumoniae induced rapid total protein tyrosine and p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation in endothelial cells Activation of p42/p44 MAPK isoforms is an early step in cell activation and intracellular signaling .
Western blot analysis showed a time-dependently enhanced total protein tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
5a ) , specifically of phosphorylated p42 and p44 MAPK isoforms in HUVEC ( Fig .
5b ) and HAEC ( Fig .
5¢ ) .
p42/ p44 MAPK-phosphorylation peaked at 10 ( HUVEC ) to 15 min ( HAEC ) .
Discussion The study presented demonstrates that C. preumonige can infect and activate endothelial cells .
The C. preumoniae strain GiD , isolated from a man with bronchitis , was used and shown to up-regulate endothelial adhesion molecules followed by increased rolling , adhesion , and transendothelial migration of human leukocytes ( PMN and monocytes ) .
These effects were reduced by mAb directed against different adhesion molecules on PMN ( B ; inte-grins ) , monocytes ( B , integrins , VLA , ) , and endothelial cells ( ICAM-1 , E-selectin , VCAM-1 ) .
Overall , these observations add important new properties to this bacterium regarding its capacity to 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology control 0 60 15 30 60 120 60 min FIGURE 4 .
Role of NF- « B in C. pneumoniae-mediated endothelial cell activation .
This aspect was analyzed using ( a ) EMSA , ( b ) NF-KB reporter gene assay , and ( c ) immunofluorescence .
a , HUVEC were stimulated with 6.5 X 10° IFU/ml C. preu- moniae for times indicated .
Nuclear proteins were extracted and processed for EMSA .
Note enhanced binding of NF- « B to corresponding consensus oli- c gonucleotides starting after 15 min of C. preu- moniae addition .
A representative gel ( of three ) is I demonstrated .
b , NF- « B activation was confirmed by enhanced NF- « B-dependent transcription of a lu ciferase gene transiently transfected into HUVEC ( b ) ( see Materials and Methods for details ) .
A total of 10 ng/ml IL-1B was used as positive control in both assay systems .
Data presented are mean + SEM of three separate experiments .
c , HUVEC were grown on glass chamber slides and stimulated with 6.5 X 10° IFU/ml C. preumoniae for 30 min .
Cells were permeabilized with acetone/methanol and in cubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human NF- « B p65 Ab followed by the addition of an ALEXA-488- conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig Ab .

initiate a cascade of events leading to endothelial cell activation , inflammation , and thrombosis .
In vivo , endothelial cell infection may occur directly via blood-borne C. pneumoniae or indirectly as shown by recent work by Gaydos et al .
demonstrating that C. preumoniae transfer to human endothelial cells may proceed by cell-to-cell spread from infected adherent mononuclear phagocytes ( 44 ) .

Almost nothing is known about the signal transduction pathways activated upon target cell infection .
Our studies , aimed to identify possible intracellular signaling steps involved , indicated that protein tyrosine phosphorylation , MAPK activation , and NF-KB activation/translocation occurred within 10-15 min of 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 4840 a kDa 205 - sap 97 - % ss - i `` 66 - .

Representative gels ( of three for a , five for b , and two for c ) are demonstrated .
Chlamydia addition to endothelial cells .
Subsequently increased mRNA levels and translation of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 were noted .
These results indicate that C. pneumoniae triggers immediate events of cell activation , suggesting that C. pneumoniae attachment is sufficient to initiate an endothelial response and that bacterial uptake may not be required for this pro-cess .
Chlamydia , pretreated with polymyxin B to inactivate LPS , were still able to stimulate endothelial cells , while heat-killed Chlamydia did not induce adhesion molecule expression , suggesting that living bacteria but not chlamydial LPS may be required for cell activation .
After initial attachment , Chlamydiae are internalized ; they dissociate themselves from the endocytotic pathway by actively modifying the vacuole to become fusogenic with exocytic vesicles ( 46 ) .
Interaction with this secretory pathway appears to provide a pathogenic mechanism that allows chlamydiae to establish themselves in a site that is not destined to fuse with lysosomes .
Further studies are required to determine the relationship between distinct steps of this chlamydial development cycle and initiation of host cell signaling pathways .
Upon infection with intracellular pathogens , NF-KB activation , enhanced expression of adhesion molecules , and increase in leu-kocytes-target cell interaction may be an uniform and nonspecific endothelial cell reaction .
Actually , we recently reported a similar pattern of host cell activation in Listeria monocytogenes-infected endothelial cells ( 32 ) .
In subsequent studies , we were able to identify Listeria-induced host cell-derived ceramide as the second messenger that initiated NF-KB activation and that therefore represented the link between Listeria infection and endothelial cell activation ( 47 ) .
However , preliminary data in C. pneumoniae-in-fected endothelial cells indicate that ceramides are not increased , suggesting that , in case of Chlamydia , they are not a key intracellular mediator ( Kriill et al .
, unpublished observation ) .
Overall , we ENDOTHELIAL CELL INFECTION WITH Chlamydia pneumoniae believe that bacteria-induced target cell activation results from stimulation of common and distinct ( dependent on pathogen-spe-cific virulence factors ) signaling pathways in host cells .
The interpretation of our study is limited to cultured human large vessel endothelial cells .
For an exact analysis of C. prew-moniae-related alterations of endothelial function in clinical dis-orders , it would be desirable to also study human small vessel endothelial cells of different organs .
However , the isolation and culture of these cells in sufficient quantities is difficult , and therefore the applicability of the data presented to human disease must be verified in further studies .
At least with respect to large vessel endothelium , we provided data demonstrating no substantial difference between cultured human large vein and aortic endothelial cells .
In conclusion , we present evidence that C. pneumoniae can infect HUVEC and HAEC and activate different signal transduction pathways : protein tyrosine phosphorylation , MAPK stimulation , and activation/translocation of NF- « B occurred within minutes .
Within hours , increased mRNA and surface expression of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 was noted , which in turn resulted in enhanced leukocyte ( monocytes , PMN ) -HUVEC interaction .
Overall , the data presented suggest that C. preumoniae infection triggers a cascade of events that could lead to endothelial damage , inflammation , and thrombosis .
