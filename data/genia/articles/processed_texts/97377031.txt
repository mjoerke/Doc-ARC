ZEB , a vertebrate homolog of Zfh-1 , binds a subset of E boxes and blocks myogenesis through transcriptional repression of muscle genes .
We present evidence here that ZEB also has an important role in controlling hematopoietic gene transcription .
Two families of transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoiesis are c-Myb and Ets .
These factors act synergistically to activate transcription , and this synergy is required for transcription of at least several important hematopoietic genes .
ZEB blocks the activity of c-Myb and Ets individually , but together the factors synergize to resist this repression .
Such repression imposes a requirement for both c-Myb and Ets for transcriptional activity , providing one explanation for why synergy between these factors is important .
The balance between repression by ZEB and transcriptional activation by c-Myb/Ets provides a flexible regulatory mechanism for controlling gene expression in hematopoietic cells .
We demonstrate that one target of this positive/negative regulation in vivo is the 4 integrin , which play a key role in normal hematopoiesis and function of mature leukocytes .
Keywords : c-Myb/Ets/hematopoiesis/o4 integrin/ repression/ZEB Introduction The Zfh family is comprised of zinc finger/homeodomain proteins that were first identified in Drosophila where they are required for proper differentiation of tissues such as the central nervous system ( CNS ) and muscle ( Fortini et al .
, 1991 ; Lai et al .
, 1993 ) .
However , the mechanism of action of the Zfh protein in Drosophila is unknown .
A vertebrate homolog of Drosophila Zfh-2 , ATBF-1 , has been identified and shown to repress the expression of the a-fetoprotein gene ( Yasuda et al .
, 1994 ) .
We have found recently that the vertebrate homolog of Drosophila Zfh-1 , ZEB , represses muscle genes and regulates myogenic differentiation ( Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
Thus , the Zth family appears to regulate tissue differentiation by repressing gene transcription .
ZEB binds to a subset of E boxes ( CANNTG ) with the 3924 sequence CACCTG ( Genetta et al .
, 1994 ) .
Once bound to these sites in the promoter region of muscle genes , ZEB represses transcription and blocks muscle differentiation .
ZEB is displaced from these E boxes as myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins ( bHLH ) ( myoD , myogenin , myf-5 , MRF-4 ) , that also bind to these sites , accumulate during muscle differentiation ( Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
The interplay between ZEB and bHLH proteins at different genes may provide a mechanism for imposing temporal order on the expression of muscle genes .
Zfh-1 is expressed in the CNS , and its overexpression results in an early embryonic lethal phenotype with severe CNS defects in Drosophila ( Fortini et al .
, 1991 ) .
ZEB is also expressed in the CNS , suggesting that it may have a role in differentiation of other tissues in addition to muscle .
In fact , ZEB was described originally in B cells , although no transcriptional activity was reported ( Genetta et al .
, 1994 ) .
Therefore , we investigated a role for ZEB in hematopoietic cells .
One target of ZEB in myogenesis is the 4 integrin gene ( Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
o4 is one of a number of integrins that associate with a common B1 subunit ( Lobb and Hemler , 1994 ; Springer , 1994 ) .
o4 integrin is expressed early in muscle development where it interacts with its ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM-1 ) to mediate cell-cell interactions important for myogenesis ( Rosen et al .
, 1992 ; Sheppard et al .
, 1994 ) .
Interestigly , G4 integrin is also expressed in hematopoietic cells , where it has a key role in the differentiation of all hematopoietic lineages through its interaction with fibronectin and VCAM-1 in the stromal matrix and stromal cells in the bone marrow and fetal liver ( Miyake et al .
, 1991 ; Roldan et a/ .
, 1992 ; Teixido et al .
, 1992 ) .
o4 is expressed before most lineage-specific markers on all hematopoietic cell lineages during the early stages of hematopoiesis ( Sanchez et al .
, 1993 ; Hamamura et al .
, 1996 ) .
However , as hematopoietic differentiation proceeds , its expression becomes restricted to only a few lineages such as lymphocytes and some subsets of myeloid cells , where it continues to function by targeting these leukocytes to sites of inflammation ( Lobb and Hemler , 1994 ) .
These observations , together with recent reports showing that 4 is required in vivo for normal hematopoiesis in mice ( Hamamura et a/ .
, 1996 ; Arroyo et al .
, 1996 ) , indicate an important role for 4 in hematopoiesis and leukocyte function .
( 4 integrin expression continues to be regulated in mature leukocytes as G4 expression is up-regulated during mitogenic activation ( Sanchez-Madrid et al .
, 1986 ) and differentially regulated among lymphoid subsets ( Shimizu et al .
, 1990 ; Picker et al .
, 1991 ) .
We demonstrate that ZEB activity , and hence ( 4 integrin expression , is regulated in hematopoietic cells through a mechanism distinct from that which we have characterized in muscle ( Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
Instead of being displaced from the promoter by bHLH proteins , the Â© Oxford University Press hematopoietic transcription factor c-Myb synergizes with Ets proteins to resist repression by ZEB in hematopoietic cells .
In addition to regulating the 04 gene , c-Myb and Ets also play a crucial role in the regulation of other hematopoietic genes and thus in hematopoiesis itself ( Graf , 1992 ; Lipsick , 1996 ) .
Disruption of ets and c-myb genes has been shown to severely affect the proper development of multiple hematopoietic lineages ( Mucenski et al .
, 1991 ; Scott et al .
, 1994 ; Muthusamy et al .
, 1995 ; Shivdasani and Orkin , 1996 ) .
Interestingly , the E26 virus , which carries the v-myb oncogene as a fusion with v-ets , efficiently induces erythroleukemia , whereas avian myelo-blastosis virus ( AMV ; which carries v-myb but lacks v-ets ) does not ( Radke et al .
, 1982 ; Metz and Graf , 1991 @ , b ) , providing evidence of the potent effect of the synergism between c-Myb and Ets in the regulation of hematopoietic genes and specific steps in hematopoiesis .
Only a few hematopoietic genes have been identified as targets of c-Myb , and it is interesting to note that several of these genes which have been examined in detail are dependent upon synergism between c-Myb and Ets .
Such genes include the early myeloid markers mim-1 ( Ness et al .
, 1989 ; Dudek et al .
, 1992 ) and CD13 ( Shapiro , 1995 ) , CD4 ( Siu et al .
, 1992 ) , p56 `` ( McCracken et al .
, 1994 ) and the early hematopoietic marker CD34 ( Melotti and Calabretta , 1994 ; Melotti et al .
, 1994 ) .
It has been demonstrated with some of these genes that expression is not induced by c-Myb or Ets separately , but is dependent on the combination of both factors ( McCracken et al .
, 1994 ) , suggesting that , as with the oA gene , this synergy may overcome a silencer that blocks activity of the factors individually .
Indeed , such silencer elements have been reported in some of the above genes ( Allen et al .
, 1992 ; Sawada et al .
, 1994 ; Perrotti et al .
, 1995 ; Duncan et al .
, 1996 ) .
Although the repressor protein has not been characterized for CD4 and p56 ' `` * , ZEB sites are evident in both genes , suggesting that ZEB may be responsible for the silencer activity .
Here , we demonstrate that ZEB is important in regulating gene expression in hematopoietic cells .
Regulation of ZEB activity in hematopoietic cells is distinct from that in muscle , and our results suggest that a fine balance between repression by ZEB and synergistic activation by c-Myb and Ets regulates gene expression in hematopoietic cells .
Results ZEB is expressed and binds ZEB sites in hematopoietic cells , but it does not repress gene expression ZEB blocks muscle differentiation by repressing muscle genes .
One such gene is 4 integrin ( Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
In addition to its expression in muscle , ( 4 integrin has a key role in hematopoietic differentiation , leukocyte trafficking and recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation ( Miyake et al .
, 1991 ; Yednock et al .
, 1992 ; Lobb and Hemler , 1994 ) .
The interaction between 04 integrin on hematopoietic cells and VCAM-1 and fibronectin on stromal cells and stromal matrix in the fetal liver and bone marrow is important for normal hematopoiesis ( Miyake et al .
, 1991 ; Roldan et al .
, 1992 ) .
Previous results demonstrated that Ets sites in the first c-Myb/Ets overcome ZEB repression 76 bp of the ( 4 promoter gene are active in most cell types ( Rosen et al .
, 1994 ) , making it unlikely that these sites alone could account for the restricted pattern of o4 expression .
In order to understand how the 0A gene is regulated in hematopoietic cells , we transfected 04 gene promoter constructs into G4 ( + ) and ( 4 ( - ) cells .
In o4 ( - ) cells , the activity of the promoter was blocked in constructs containing sequences upstream of -300 bp ( Figure 1A-D ) .
This pattern of promoter activity was the same as the pattern we found in o4 ( - ) myoblasts ( Figure 1D , and Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
Two ZEB sites ( at positions -361 and -399 bp ) are responsible for this silencer activity in myoblasts ( Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
When the same constructs were transfected into the o4 ( + ) T-cell line Jurkat , the erythroleukemia cell line HEL or the B cell line Raji , we found that the activity is maintained in promoter constructs extending to -2.0 kb ( Figure 1E and F ) as o4 ( - ) myoblasts differentiate into x4 ( + ) myotubes ( Figure 1H ) .
The lack of repressor activity suggested that ZEB may not be expressed in hematopoietic cells .
However , we found that Jurkat cells express high levels of ZEB ( Figure 2A ) , and ZEB has also been shown to be expressed in B cells ( Genetta et al .
, 1994 ) .
In muscle , ZEB is displaced from E361 and E399 by bHLH proteins as ( 4 ( - ) myoblasts differentiate into O4 ( + ) myotubes ( Figure 1D and H , and Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
Even though ZEB is expressed in hematopoietic cells , it was possible that the ratio of ZEB to bHLH proteins ( E proteins ) is low and ZEB is prevented from binding ZEB sites .
However , increasing this ratio by overexpression of ZEB in hematopoietic cells did not result in repressor activity ( Figure 2B ) , contrary to myotubes where overexpression of ZEB displaced myoD/E proteins complexes from E boxes and blocked o4 promoter activity ( Figure 2C , and Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
Next , we examined the capacity of ZEB to bind ZEB sites from the oA promoter .
Gel retardation assays with E361 and E399 gave the same pattern of nuclear protein binding with nuclear extracts from 04 ( + ) hematopoietic cells and with ( 4 ( - ) cells ; we found binding of ZEB along with the ubiquitous bHLH protein USF ( upstream stimulatory factor ) ( Sawadogo and Roeder , 1985 ) ( Figure 3A and B ) .
However , the ZEB sites bind only weakly to USF , and overexpression of USF did not activate or repress transcription through the ZEB sites ( results not shown ) .
Therefore , the lack of repression of the o4 promoter observed in hematopoietic cells was not due to the lack of binding of ZEB to its sites in the oA promoter .
ZEB sites are silencers in hematopoietic cells One explanation for the lack of ZEB repressor activity in hematopoietic cells was that a hematopoietic-specific transcription factor may block ZEB function in the context of the o4 gene promoter .
To investigate this possibility , we first examined the activity of ZEB sites out of the context of the o4 promoter .
ZEB sites efficiently blocked the activity of the Ets sites from the o4 promoter in 04 ( + ) hematopoietic cells ( Figure 4A ) as well as in G4 ( - ) cell types ( Figure 4B ) .
These results are in contrast to 04 ( + ) myotubes where the loss of ZEB activity ( E361 and E399 did not have any repressor effect on Ets activity ) was the result of the displacement of ZEB by myoD/E12 3925 A.A.Postigo et al .

during myogenic differentiation ( Figure 4C , and Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
Overexpression of the bHLH E proteins E12 and E47 did not have any effect on repression by ZEB in Jurkat cells ( Figure 4A ) , further suggesting that bHLH proteins do not displace ZEB in hematopoietic cells as they do in muscle cells ( Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
The hematopoietic transcription factor c-Myb is necessary but not sufficient to overcome repression by ZEB The results described above suggest that a hematopoietic-specific transcription factor may overcome ZEB repression 3926 in the context of the 4 gene promoter .
c-Myb is one of the first transcription factors detected during hematopoiesis , where it has been shown to play a key role in the differentiation process ( reviewed in Graf , 1992 ) .
Additionally , c-Myb has been shown to synergize with Ets factors in the regulation of hematopoietic genes .
The early appearance of oA during hematopoiesis suggests that od expression is likely to depend upon a transcription factor such as c-Myb .
Indeed , a number of potential c-Myb sites are evident upstream and downstream of the ZEB sites ( from -130 bp to -2.0 kb ) in the oÃ©4 promoter ( Figure 5A and data not shown ) .

Lymphoid cells express high levels of ZEB mRNA and overexpression of ZEB does not silence 4 promoter activity .
( A ) mRNA levels for ZEB in 04 ( - ) C2C12 myoblasts , G4 ( - ) HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and 4 ( + ) T-lymphoid Jurkat cells were determined by Northern blot analysis using a NIeI-HindIlH fragment of ZEB cDNA .

ZEB binds ZEB sites in both G4 ( - ) and 4 ( + ) cells .
Gel retardation assays using a probe containing ZEB sites E361 and E399 from the G4 promoter gave a similar pattern of binding with nuclear extracts from 04 ( + ) Jurkat cells ( A ) and o4 ( - ) HT1080 cells ( B ) .
Antibodies ( 0.5 ug ) against ZEB , USF , E12 , HEB ( this figure ) and MyoD and c-Myb ( not shown ) were added in the binding assays .
Only ZEB and USF show binding , as demonstrated by supershift of the corresponding bands ( indicated as * ) .
'NS ' indicates non-specific complexes .
ZEB and USF binding was competed with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe , but not with the corresponding mutant probe ( not shown ) .
for c-Myb binding with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells ( Figure 5A and B and data not shown ) .
Binding was evident with extracts from Jurkat cells but not with extracts from the control 4 ( - ) /c-myb ( - ) fibrosarcoma cell line HT1O80 ( Figure 5A ) .
This binding was blocked by unlabeled c-Myb sites from the 04 gene promoter and other genes regulated by c-Myb [ such as the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) 8 enhancer ( Hernandez-Munain and Krangel , 1994 ) ] , but not by their corresponding mutated sites ( Figure 5B ) .
Additionally , binding was inhibited by anti-c-Myb antibodies ( Figure 5B ) .
To determine whether c-Myb was sufficient to activate the oA gene promoter in o4 ( - ) cells , an expression vector for c-Myb was co-transfected with oA gene promoter constructs into the 4 ( - ) /c-myb ( - ) HTIO8O fibrosarcoma cells .
c-Myb overcame the repressor activity of ZEB and activated the oÃ©4 gene promoter ( Figure 6A ) .
Reporter constructs containing different combinations of Ets sites , ZEB sites and c-Myb sites were then transfected into Jurkat cells [ as well as 04 ( - ) HTIO8O cells ] ( Figure 6A and B ) .
The activity of the ZEB sites in Jurkat cells was blocked by the combination of Ets and c-Myb sites ; however , mutation of either the Ets or c-Myb sites restored repressor activity ( Figure 6B ) .
These results demonstrate the requirement for both Ets and c-Myb sites to overcome repression by ZEB .
It is interesting to note that addition of the c-Myb sites to the Ets sites did not change the level of transcription significantly above that of the Ets sites alone .
Therefore , c-Myb does not overcome ZEB repression by increasing transcription when combined with Ets factors and simply overwhelming repression by ZEB .
Instead , the combination of c-Myb and Ets activates transcription through a mechanism distinct from either factor alone and in a fashion resistant to ZEB .
ZEB fused to the DNA-binding domain ( DBD ) of the yeast protein Gal4 blocked the activity of the Ets sites ( Figure 6C ) , demonstrating directly that ZEB blocks Ets transactivation .
Additionally , ZEB fused to the DBD of the bacterial protein LexA blocked transactivation by 3927 A.A.Postigo et al .

ZEB sites are silencers in 04 ( + ) Jurkat cells when taken out of the context of the 04 gene promoter .
E361 and E399 ZEB binding sites were cloned upstream of the ( 4 Ets sites in the -7604CAT , and the resulting constructs were transfected in 04 ( + ) Jurkat cells .
Repressor activity was found in G4 ( + ) Jurkat cells ( A ) ( similar results were obtained with the erythroleukemia HEL cell line ) as well as in 04 ( - ) HT1080 cells ( B ) but not in G4 ( + ) C2C12 myotubes ( C ) .
The control E box at -585 bp which is not a ZEB site did not repress Ets activity .
Overexpression of the bHLH E proteins E12 and E47 in Jurkat cells did not block repression by ZEB ( A ) .
Twenty five ug of ( ACAT reporter constructs were co-transfected in Jurkat with or without 60 ug of E12 or E47 expression vectors .
In HT1O80 cells and C2C12 myotubes , 3 pig of the reporter constructs were transfected .
c-Myb fused to the DBD of Gal4 ( Figure 6C ) , indicating that ZEB blocks the transactivation domain of c-Myb .
Thefore , ZEB blocks the transactivation activity of Ets and c-Myb individually , but the combination of these sites synergistically overcomes the repression .
These results suggest that expression of c-Myb is an important determining factor in the control ( 4 expression in hematopoetic cells .
In support of this conclusion , forced expression of c-Myb in 04 ( - ) /c-myb ( - ) cells led to expression of endogenous 04 on the cell surface ( Figure 7 ) .
As another way of demonstrating an important role for c-Myb in the regulation of ( 4 gene expression , we used a dominant-negative form of c-Myb ( MT ) that contains the DBD of c-Myb but lacks the transactivation domain ( Badiani et al .
, 1994 ) .
This dominant-negative c-Myb has been shown previously to block c-Myb function in vivo and in vitro ( Badiani et al .
, 1994 ; Taylor et al .
, 1996 ) .
Co-transfection of the MT expression vector with the -2.00A4CAT reporter in Jurkat cells repressed the activity of -2.004CAT to a level similar to that found in 04 ( - ) HT1O80 cells ( Figure 8A ) .
These results provide additional evidence that c-Myb is required for ( 4 gene promoter activity in hematopoietic cells .
Loss of ( 4 expression on hematopoietic progenitors in c-myb ( -/- ) mice c-myb ( -/- ) mice die in utero due to severe anemia , showing a reduced number of hematopoietic precursors in the liver ( Mucenski et al .
, 1991 ) .
We examined the expression of 4 integrin on hematopoietic cells in embryonic day 14.5 c-myb ( -/- ) mice .
If c-Myb is indeed important for expression of 04 , then ( 4 should be absent from hematopoietic cells in these mice .
We found that expression of 04 integrin in the hematopoietic cell pro 3928 genitors present in the fetal liver was abrogated in the c-myb ( -/- ) mice ( Figure 8B ) , but was high in c-myb ( +/ + ) mice ( Figure 8C ) , indicating that in vivo expression of 04 requires c-Myb .
As controls , expression of other markers seemed to be unaffected in c-myb ( -/- ) mice ( results not shown ) .
Expression of G4 in other tissues such as skeletal and smooth muscle and neural crest derivatives was similar in both the ( -/- ) and ( +/+ ) genotypes ( data not shown ) , indicating a selective role for c-Myb in the expression of 4 in the hematopoietic system .
These results demonstrate a key role for c-Myb in the regulation of the oA gene , and place 04 as one of the first genes demonstrated to be regulated by c-Myb in vivo .
Discussion ZEB is a vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila Zfh-1 protein .
Zfh-1 has been shown to be important in differentiation of tissues such as the CNS and muscle in Drosophila ( Fortini et al .
, 1991 ; Lai et al .
, 1993 ) .
We have found previously that ZEB is an active transcriptional repressor that , like Zfh-1 , regulates muscle differentiation ( Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
ZEB is also expressed in other tissues , and we present evidence here that it may also have a regulatory role in hematopoiesis .
Both c-Myb and Ets are required for normal hematopoiesis ( Shivdasani and Orkin , 1996 ) .
These factors can act in synergy to activate transcription , and this synergy is essential for activation of important hematopoietic genes ( reviewed in Graf , 1992 ) .
ZEB blocks the activity of Ets and Myb individually , but repressor activity is overcome by the c-Myb/Ets synergy .
ZEB sites in the promoter of the 4 integrin gene render expression dependent upon the synergy between c-Myb and Ets and may provide a explanation for why this synergy A Hï¬i t Id'iï¬f t __ if ?

is required .
During differentiation and cell activation , the level of c-Myb varies and , when it is expressed , it synergizes with Ets factors to overcome ZEB repression and activate hematopoietic genes .
We presented in vitro and in vivo evidence that in the absence of c-Myb , ZEB c-Myb/Ets overcome ZEB repression blocks oA expression throughout all hematopoietic cell lineages .
Conversely , we found that without ZEB , the o4 gene would be expressed constitutively as a result of the Ets sites in the promoter .
This mechanism of regulating ZEB activity and 4 expression in hematopoietic cells is different from what we found previously in muscle cells , where ZEB is displaced from ZEB sites by myogenic bHLH factors that appear during myogenic differentiation ( Postigo and Dean , 1997 ) .
During development , initial hematopoiesis takes place in the yolk sac ( or analogs in mammalians ) and paraortic compartments ( reviewed in Dorshkind , 1994 ; Orkin , 1995 ) .
Hematopoietic stem cells migrate from those sites to the fetal liver of the embryo where most of the embryonic hematopoiesis occurs .
Perinatally , stem cells migrate to the thymus and bone marrow .
Recently , chimeric animal experiments have shown that B1 integrins ( a larger subclass of integrins including ( 41 ) are involved in this migration process ( Hirscht et al .
, 1996 ) .
Hematopoiesis in the fetal liver , thymus and bone marrow requires the interaction of adhesion molecules on the stem cells with ligands in stromal cells .
One of the interactions that has been shown in vivo and in vitro to be crucial for normal hematopoietic development is the binding of the 4 integrin on the surface of stem cells to its ligands VCAM-1 and fibronectin in the stroma of these organs ( Miyake et al .
, 1991 ; Roldan et al .
, 1992 ) .
o4 appears on the surface of precursor cells very early during hematopoiesis , before most lineage-specific markers ( Sanchez et al .
, 1993 ) .
Antibodies against 04 and VCAM-1 have been shown to block differentiation of cultured precursors ( Miyake et al .
, 1991 ; Roldan et al .
, 1992 ; Teixido et al .
, 1992 ) .
Likewise , injection of anti-o4 antibodies into pregnant mice blocked erythropoiesis and inhibited other lineages in the embryos ( Hamamura et al .
, 1996 ) .
Additionally , it has been shown in mice chimeric for ( 4 that this integrin is required for lymphoid differentiation in the bone marrow ( Arroyo et al .
, 1996 ) .
Disruption of the c-myb gene causes mice to die in utero due to a failure in liver hematopoiesis , resulting in severe anemia ( Mucenski et al .
, 1991 ) .
Interestingly , the precursors cells present in c-myb ( -/- ) animals are able to differentiate in culture to their corresponding mature phenotypes , indicating that the defect is in the failure of the precursor population in the liver to expand , instead of in the differentiation process per se ( Mucenski et al .
, 1991 ) .
c-Myb has been shown to be required for hematopoietic cells to enter S phase , suggesting that c-Myb is important for efficient cell division ( Stern and Smith , 1986 ; Gewirtz et al .
, 1989 ) .
Moreover , recent evidence has demonstrated that inactivation of c-Myb in hematopoietic cells triggers apoptosis and that c-Myb regulates expression of be/-2 , which protects against apoptosis ( Frampton et al .
, 1996 ; Taylor et al .
, 1996 ) .
We found that one result of the disruption of the c-myb gene is the loss of ( 4 integrin expression .
As outlined above , the failure of hematopoiesis in the c-myb ( -/- ) mice appears to result from a failure in proliferation and/ or triggering of apoptosis ( Mucenski et al .
, 1991 ; Frampton et al .
, 1996 ; Taylor et al .
, 1996 ) .
Interestingly , G4 integrin can transmit signals that trigger cell proliferation ( Nojima et al .
, 1990 ; Damle and Aruffo , 1991 ) , and adhesion of integrins to ligand has been shown to prevent apoptosis 3929 A.A.Postigo et al .

Therefore , the loss of o4 integrin in c-myb ( -/- ) mice may contribute to the failure of the hematopoietic population to expand , a phenotype observed in these animals ( Mucenski et al .
, 1991 ) .
Early during hematopoiesis , G4 integrin is expressed in all cell lineages : lymphoid and myeloid precursors , erythroblasts and megakaryocytes ( Miyake et al .
, 1991 ; Rosemblat et al .
, 1991 ; Teixido et al .
, 1992 ; Avraham et al .
, 1993 ; Sadahira et al .
, 1995 ; Hamumura et al .
, 1996 ) .
As these precursors mature , G4 expression becomes restricted to lymphocytes and some myeloid cells ( Lobb and Hemler et a/ .
, 1994 ) .
Thus , control of 0A expression is very tightly regulated during hematopoiesis .
Regulation of 4 integrin expression continues to be critical beyond hematopoiesis , where it is expressed differentially on the different lymphocyte subsets ( Shimizu et al .
, 1990 ; Picker et al .
, 1991 ) , and its expression is up-regulated upon mitogenic stimulation ( Sanchez-Madrid et al .
, 1986 ) .
Deregulation of G4 expression has been associated with inflammatory diseases and hematologic malignancies ( Freedman et al .
, 1992 ; Moller et al .
, 1992 ; Juneja et al .
, 1993 ; Kuriyama et al .
, 1994 ) .
We propose that control of 4 integrin expression in hematopoietic cells is the result of a fine balance between repression by ZEB and activation by c-Myb/Ets .
ZEB imposes a requirement for both c-Myb and Ets to activate the 4 gene ( and perhaps other 3930 % chloramphenicol acetylated F Fig .
6. c-Myb regulates G4 gene promoter activity .
( A ) Overexpression of c-Myb in the 04 ( - ) HT1080 cell line overcomes repression by ZEB .
Three ug of the -7604CAT , -2.004CAT , pETS-ZEB-CAT and pETS-ZEB-MYB-CAT reporter constructs were co-transfected with 0.9 ug of a PSV-c-Myb expression vector .
pETS-ZEB-CAT indicates that the ZEB site E361 was cloned upstream of the Ets sites in the -760A4CAT reporter .
pETS-ZEB-MYB-CAT indicates that four copies of the c-Myb site at -134 bp were cloned upstream of the ZEB sites of the pETS-ZEB-CAT construct .
( B ) The activity of the 04 gene promoter in Jurkat cells depends on synergistic activity of c-Myb and Ets transcription factors .
Mutation of the Ets sites ( indicated by pETSmut ) abolishes the capacity of c-Myb to overcome ZEB repression .
Thirty ug of the different reporters were transfected in Jurkat cells ( similar results were obtained using the erythroleukemia HEL cell line ) .
( C ) ZEB represses transcriptional activation by Ets and c-Myb factors individually .
Three ug of -76-G4-CAT ( containing five copies of the Gal4 DNA-binding site upstream of the -7604CAT ) was co-transfected in HT1O80 cells with 2 ug of G-ZEB which encodes a fusion protein of ZEB with the DBD of Gal4 .
One ug of pL-G ( containing six LexA-binding sites and two Gal4 sites upstream of the E1B TATA box ) was co-transfected in HT1080 with 0.5 ug of a Gal4-c-Myb expression vector with or without 2 ug of L-ZEB which encodes a fusion protein between the DBD of LexA and ZEB .

We present evidence that regulation of 04 expression can result from variations of c-Myb expression : c-Myb levels ( in parallel to oA expression ) decline during hematopoiesis as precursors mature ( Graf , 1992 ) and increases as a result of mitogenic activation ( Torrelli et al .
, 1985 ; Pauza , 1987 ) .

Inactivation or disruption of the c-myb gene abolishes expression of 4 integrin in hematopoietic cells .
( A ) Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of c-Myb ( DN-myb ; MT ) blocked the activity of the 4 gene promoter in Q4 ( + ) Jurkat cells .
Twenty-five ug of -7604CAT and -2.004CAT reporter constructs were co-transfected in ( 4 ( + ) Jurkat cells with 25 , 50 and 75 ug of DN-myb .
Note that DN-myb blocked the activity of -2.0 o4 CAT ( contains c-Myb sites ) but not of -760A4CAT ( lacks c-Myb sites ) .
( B and C ) ( 4 is expressed on all hematopoietic cells in E14.5 liver of c-myb ( +/+ ) mice ( B ) but was not evident on hematopoietic cells in the E14.5 liver of c-myb ( -/- ) mice ( C ) .
Frozen sections of E14.5 mice were immunostained with anti-o4 antibody as described ( Rosen et al .
, 1992 ) .
Precursors in the fetal liver of c-myb ( -/- ) embryos expressed other hematopoietic markers ( results not shown ) .
disappearance of c-Myb as they mature to erythrocytes and platelets ( Rosemblat et al .
, 1991 ; Avraham et al .
1993 ; Sadahira et al .
, 1995 ; Hamumura et al .
, 1996 ) .
Lymphoid and some subsets of myeloid cells also down-regulate ( 4 expression as c-Myb decreases during their differentiation , although they still express 04 when they reach the bloodstream ( Lobb and Hemler , 1994 ) .
Expression is again up-regulated upon cellular activation ( Sanchez-Madrid et al .
, 1986 ) .
The Ets family comprises an increasing number of members ( Leiden , 1993 ; Wasylick et al .
, 1993 ; Crepieux et al .
, 1994 ) .
The set of Ets factors that bind the 04 promoter seems to vary from one cell type to another and , at least , includes Ets-1 and GABP a and [ } ( Rosen et al .
, 1994 and unpublished results ) .
The expression and activity of Ets proteins are regulated during T lymphocyte differentiation and activation ( Pognonec et al .
, 1988 ; Bhat et al .
, 1989 , 1990 ; Muthusamy et al .
, 1995 ) .
Although we have found that the Ets sites in the 4 gene promoter are active c-Myb/Ets overcome ZEB repression in most cells that we have tested , it is possible that , like those of c-Myb , their activity varies during hematopoietic differentiation and in different hematopoietic lineages , providing an additional level of regulation .
Likewise , it is also possible that the level of ZEB in hematopoietic cells changes during hematopoiesis and/or cell activation .
Therefore , in addition to c-Myb , regulation of Ets and/or ZEB activities could add further flexibility to the regulation of the oA gene ( and perhaps other hematopoietic genes regulated by c-Myb/Ets ) .
Although the studies presented here have relied on the comparison of promoter activities in hematopoietic cells versus non-hematopoietic cells , they provide strong evidence that c-Myb and Ets factors synergize to overcome repression by ZEB .
While these experiments do not provide conclusive evidence that the c-Myb/Ets-ZEB regulatory pathway plays a critical role in hematopoietic cell differentiation and function , taken together with patterns of c-Myb and Ets expression and the experiments in the c-myb ( -/- ) mice , these experiments suggest that this balance between repression by ZEB and activation by c-Myb/Ets is involved in the regulation of the 4 gene and possibly several other hematopoietic genes .
Interestingly , the combination of c-Myb and Ets did not increase transcription significantly above the level with Ets alone .
Therefore , the c-Myb/Ets combination does not overcome repression by ZEB simply by increasing transcription but , instead , the c-Myb/Ets synergy activates transcription through a mechanism distinct from that of either factor alone .
It will be of interest to determine the molecular basis for the resistance to ZEB repression .
However , further information about how c-Myb/Ets synergize to activate transcription is needed .
ZEB may provide a tool to analyze such mechanisms of transcriptional synergy .
A target of future studies will be the components of the basal transcription complex that interact with c-Myb/Ets .
It is likely that the combination of c-Myb and Ets proteins interact with basal transcription complex components in a fashion distinct from either factor alone and in a manner that is resistant to disruption by ZEB .
Materials and methods Cell culture The HT1O80 fibrosarcoma [ American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) , Rockville , MD ] and C33A cervical carcinoma cell lines ( ATCC ) were mantained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) containing 5 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and 5 % calf serum ( Life Technologies ) .

The pETS-ZEB-MYB-CAT reporter construct containing Ets sites , ZEB sites and c-Myb sites was constructed in the following way : two copies of the E361 site in ( 4 integrin ( including 6 bp upstream and downstream of the E box consensus site ) were cloned in the KpnlI-Apal sites of 7604CAT ( pETS-CAT ) to make pETS-ZEB-CAT .
Then , four copies of the c-Myb site at -134 bp in the 04 gene ( other c-Myb sites from the 04 promoter were also used with identical results ) were cloned in Clal-Stul sites of a polylinker blunt ended and cloned at the KpnI site to make pETS-ZEB-MYB-CAT .
pETS-MYB-CAT was constructed in a similar way but lacking the two copies of the E361 site .
