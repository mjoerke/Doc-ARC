The EMBO Journal vol.10 no.1 pp.123-132 , 1991 Identification and cloning of TCF-1 , a T lymphocyte-specific transcription factor containing a sequence specific HMG box Marc van de Wetering , Mariette Oosterwegel , Dennis Dooijes and Hans Clevers Department of Clinical Immunology , University Hospital Utrecht , PO Box 85500 , 3508 GA , Utrecht , The Netherlands Communicated by P.Borst CD3-c gene expression is controlled by a downstream T lymphocyte-specific enhancer element .
We report the identification of a T cell-specific transcription factor , TCF-1 , binding to this element .
The multimerized recognition motif of TCF-1 constituted a T cell-specific enhancer .
Subsequent cloning of TCF-1 identified three splice alternatives .
TCF-1 contained a single DNA-binding HMG box most closely related to similar boxes in the putative mammalian sex-determining gene SRY and in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mc mating type gene .
TCF-1 mRNA was expressed uniquely in T lymphocytes .
Upon cotransfection into non-T cells , TCF-1 could transactivate through its cognate motif .
These results identify TCF-1 as a T cell-specific transcription factor , which might play a role in the establishment of the mature T cell phenotype .
Key words : CD3 genes/HMG box/T cell-specific transcription factor Introduction In recent years , much information has been obtained on genes that control the phenotype of cells within metazoan organisms .
The genetic identification of genes involved in pattern formation of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans has been particularly informative .
Many of these genes appear to encode transcription factors .
This has led to the notion that the control of cellular phenotype principally occurs at the level of transcription .
Developmentally active transcription factors regulate the expression of sets of structural genes , and are thus responsible for the induction and maintenance of a particular phenotype ( Maniatis et al .
, 1987 ; Scott and Carroll , 1987 ; Atchison , 1988 ; Johnson and McKnight , 1989 ) .
Obvious practical limitations complicate similar developmental studies of higher eukaryotes , especially of mammals .
Such studies are therefore often conducted from a different perspective .
Rather than analysing early embryonic events involved in pattern-formation , attention has focused on the terminal differentiation of precursor cells into their functionally mature counterparts .
It has become feasible to clone genes that are uniquely expressed in those end-stage cells , and to identify the cis-acting elements that target transcription of such genes to particular differentiation stages .
These cis-acting elements ( promoters , enhancers , silencers ) can subsequently be used as tools to identify transcription factors that bind to specific sequence motifs © Oxford University Press within these elements .
Of particular interest are transcription factors that are uniquely active in the cell type where the structural , end-stage gene is expressed .
A number of tissue-specific transcription factors have thus been identified and cloned , including the pituitary factor Pit-1 , which controls growth hormone and prolactin gene expression ( Bodner et al .
, 1988 ; Ingraham et al .
, 1988 ) ; the B cell factor Oct-2 , involved in expression of immunoglobulin genes ( Mueller et al .
, 1988 ; Scheidereit et al .
, 1988 ) ; the erythrocyte factor EryFlI , binding to haemoglobin regulatory sequences ( Evans and Felsenfeld , 1989 ; Tsai et al .
, 1989 ) ; and the hepatic transcription factors LF-BI ( Frain et al .
, 1989 ) and DBP ( Mueller et al .
, 1990 ) .
Probably the best documented example of a transcription factor controlling cell fate in higher eukaryotes is that of MyoD and related genes .
MyoD has been shown to confer the muscle cell phenotype onto fibroblasts ( Davis et al .
, 1987 ) and to activate muscle-specific genes in cells of various origins ( Weintraub et al .
, 1989 ) .
Subsequently , MyoD was demonstrated to encode a DNA-binding protein , capable of binding and transactivating the muscle-specific muscle creatine kinase enhancer ( Lassar et al .
, 1989 ) .
Little is known about the molecular events that govern the differentiation pathway of the T lymphocyte .
One of the early events in T lineage commitment is the expression of the members of the CD3 complex .
This complex consists of at least five invariable , integral membrane proteins and is non-covalently associated with the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) on the surface of mature T cells .
Three of the CD3 genes ( CD3-4y , CD3-6 , CD3-e ) form a small family .
They are located on a stretch of 60 kb on human chromosome 11423 .
Their expression is uniquely restricted to cells of the T lineage and precedes rearrangement and expression of the TCR genes ( Clevers et al .
, 1988a ; Tunnacliffe et al .
, 1988 ) .
The tight clustering of the CD3-y/6/e locus might suggest that the CD3 genes are controlled by a single cis-acting element .
This , however , appears not to be the case .
Transgenic mice , carrying either the human CD3-8 or the human CD3-e gene on non-overlapping fragments , expressed the transgene correctly , demonstrating that the two genes each carry a complete and independent set of regulatory elements ( Clevers et al .
, 1989 ; H.Clevers and N.Lonberg , unpublished ) .
In order to identify factors that specify the T lymphocyte phenotype , we have set out to characterize T cell-specific DNA-binding proteins involved in the tissue-specific expression of the CD3-e gene .
The human CD3-e gene consists of nine exons and spans 12 kb ( Clevers et al .
, 1988b ) .
T cell-specific expression of CD3-e results from an enhancer located directly downstream of exon IX .
This enhancer occupies ~1.5 kb , constitutes a CpG island , and coincides with a DNase I-hypersensitive site present only in T lymphocytes .
Within the CD3-e enhancer , a 130 bp core is present , which by itself functions as a T cell-specific enhancer ; deletion of this core renders the remaining 123 M. van de Wetering et al .
enhancer sequences inactive ( Clevers et al .
, 1989 ) .
Here we report the identification and cloning of a transcription factor , TCF-1 , which is present in T cells only and which recognizes a motif in the CD3-e enhancer .
Results Identification of a T cell-specific DNA-binding protein , TCF-1 To identify putative transcription factors responsible for the T cell-specificity of the CD3-e enhancer , crude nuclear extracts from a panel of human T and non-T cell lines were analysed for the presence of specific DNA-binding proteins by gel retardation .
A set of four overlapping probes was generated from the CD3-e enhancer utilizing two internal restriction sites ( Figure 1A and 1B ) .
A number of sequence-specific complexes could be identified with these probes .
One of these complexes was present in all T cell lines and absent from all other cells tested .
This T cell-specific complex was only observed with probe L , giving an indication of the actual site of contact .
Figure 1C depicts a representative experiment with the probes S and L using a nuclear extract from the human T cell line Jurkat .
The T cell-specific DNA-protein complex appears as a doublet .
In order to map the recognition motif more closely , three overlapping double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized ( MW12 : bp 99-123 ; MW34 : bp 86-110 ; and MWS56 : bp 70-101 ) .
Gel retardation analysis performed with these three oligonucleotide probes revealed that the T cell-specific protein-DNA complex was formed only with MW56 , and again appeared as a typical doublet .
Figure 2A depicts an overexposure of a retardation experiment performed with probe MW56 on a large panel of nuclear extracts .
As is evident , a prominent retarded band was observed exclusively with nuclear extracts of all T cell lines .
A similar retarded band was found with extracts of the murine T cell line ELA , but not with the murine B lineage cell line Ag8 , nor with the murine fibroblast cell line Swiss-3T3 ( data not shown ) .
The T cell-specific binding activity was termed TCF-1 .
The binding specificity of TCF-1 for MWS56 was confirmed in competition experiments .
Excess unlabelled MW56 competed efficiently for the doublet band formed with the MW56 probe , whereas excess MW 12 and MW34 had no effect ( Figure 3 ) .
Furthermore , excess cold MW56 ( but not MW12 or MW34 ) could block formation of the doublet formed with probe L , proving that the T cell-specific doublets observed with probe L and with MW56 resulted from the same binding activity ( not shown ) .
To define the nucleotides contacted by TCF-1 , methylation interference footprinting was performed with T cell nuclear extracts using MW56 , end-labelled at either the positive ( MW5 ) or negative ( MW6 ) strand .
Experimental conditions were such that interactions with A and G appeared as spots of decreased intensity ; interactions with C and T were not analysed .
As depicted in Figure 4 , the positive strand footprint of Jurkat TCF-1 consisted of 5'gggagactg-agAAcAAAGegetctcacac ( where contact bases are indicated in capitals ) .
No contacts were observed with G and A on the negative strand .
Footprinting experiments performed with nuclear extracts from the human T cell line H9 confirmed these results ( data not shown ) .

The arrows indicate the position of TCF-1 .
concatamer of seven copies of MW56 was cloned upstream of the minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter of pBLCAT2 ( Luckow and Schutz , 1987 ) ; the resulting construct was termed pMW ( 56 ) ; .
The presence of the MW56-concatamer led to a S5-fold increase of the basal TK activity upon transfection in Jurkat T cells as measured in a CAT assay ( see Table I ) .
CAT analysis performed with non-T cell lines proved this enhancement to be T cell-specific ( Table D ) .
To confirm that the TCF-1 recognition motif was responsible for the observed enhancement of TK promoter activity , a variant of MWS56 was synthesized in which the AACAAAG footprint was replaced by CCGCGGT ( MW56Sac ) .
As expected , a concatamer containing seven copies of MW56Sac ( pMW56Sacq ) failed to increase the activity of the TK promoter in T cells ( Table I ) .
Control experiments showed that MW 56Sac did not bind TCF-1 in the gel retardation assay , nor did cold excess MW56Sac compete with MW56 for the binding of TCF-1 ( data not shown ) .
These experiments lent strong support to the notion that the interaction of TCF-1 with its cognate sequence activates a linked promoter , thus identifying TCF-1 as a transcription factor .

Sequence-specificity of TCF-1 .
Gel retardation analysis was performed with extracts of the T cell lines CCRF-CEM ( C ) , Jurkat ( J ) , and Peer ( P ) .
Lanes 1 : no competitor DNA ; lanes 2 : 50 ng of cold MW56 ; lanes 3 : 100 ng of cold MW56 ; lanes 4 : 100 ng of cold ( irrelevant ) MW12 ; lanes 5 : 100 ng of cold ( irrelevant ) MW34 .
Remarkably , in all extracts prepared from the CCRF-CEM , a second doublet was observed running slightly below the TCF-1 doublet ( Figures 2 and 3 ) .
The nature of this second doublet is so far unknown .
clones encoding TCF-1 were isolated .
A Agt11 cDNA library derived from the human T cell line Jurkat was screened with multimerized double-stranded MWS56 as a probe ( Singh et al .
, 1988 ; Vinson et al .
, 1988 ) .
A primary screen of 2x10° recombinant phages yielded one positive clone , designated @ TCF-1 .
Initial characterization of this recombinant phage revealed that the B-galactosidase fusion protein specifically bound the MW56 probe , and failed to bind multimerized MW12 and MW34 probes .
Furthermore , binding of the MW 56 probe to the fusion protein was blocked by excess cold MW56 , but not by MW12 , MW34 , or calf thymus DNA ( data not shown ) .The 0.9 kb insert of this phage clone was then used to screen the same Jurkat library , and a plasmid cDNA library derived from the human T cell line HPB-ALL .
Three additional phage clones and 31 recombinant plasmids were isolated .
The isolated cDNA clones could be divided into three groups as determined by restriction pattern analysis .
Sequence analysis of the @ TCF-1 insert and of representative cDNA clones isolated in the second screen yielded the following information .
Two in-frame methionines were preceded by a stop codon at bp 9 of the longest clone .
The translation initiation site was tentatively placed at the first ATG codon ( bp 80 ) , showing the best match with the Kozak-consensus ( Kozak , 1984 ) .

A clear footprint was present on the coding strand only : 5° AA ( c ) AAAG 3 ' predicted amino acid sequence ( residues 17-124 ) was relatively rich in proline residues ( 22 % ) .
This characteristic is not uncommon in transcription factors , and has been demonstrated in one case at least to constitute a transcription activation domain ( Mermod et al .
, 1989 ; and references therein ) .
The second part of the sequence shared by all clones ( residues 125-243 ) was highly charged , and predominantly basic , a feature indicative of a DNA binding domain .
Indeed , this domain was contained within the insert of @ TCF-1 ( Figure 5 ) .
The sequence of the different types of cDNA clones diverged downstream from bp 838 .
The presence of the consensus bases AG at the end of the shared sequence fits well with the occurrence of alternative splicing at this posi-tion .
The three alternative splice forms were termed TCF-1A , TCF-1B and TCF-1C .
The TCF-1A splice form , represented by the insert of @ TCF-1 , was not isolated again in the second screen .
The alternative exon of TCF-1A predicted the addition of 25 amino acid residues at the C-terminus of TCF-1 , resulting in a total length of 269 amino acids .
The alternative exon of TCF-1B similarly predicted the addition of 25 C-terminal amino acids ; however , no homology to TCF-1A was apparent in this area .
In clones of type TCF-1C , a stretch of 96 bp ( ending with AG ) , was inserted 5 ' of the TCF-1B alternative exon .
This insertional exon added 24 amino acids to the TCF-1 sequence , and precluded translation of the C-terminus encoded by TCF-1B .
The TCF-1C encoded protein was predicted to consist of 126 Table I .

pBLCAT2 contains the CAT gene driven by the non-tissue specific TK promoter ( Luckow and Schutz , 1987 ) .
The presence of the RSV enhancer clearly augments basal activity of the TK promoter in all cell types ( pPTKRSV , Clevers et al .
, 1989 ) .
The CD3-e enhancer is active in the T cell line only ( pcTK in Jurkat ) .
Similarly , seven copies of an oligonucleotide containing the TCF-1 cognate motif enhance the activity of the TK promoter in Jurkat cells only ( pTK56 ; ) .
Replacement of the TCF-1 contact bases in this oligonucleotide by irrelevant sequence abrogates this T cell-specific enhancer activity ( pTK56Sacq ) .
268 amino acid residues .
Preliminary characterization of genomic TCF-1 clones has confirmed the exon/intron boundary at bp 838 , and has demonstrated that all alternative exons map within an area of 5 kb ( M. van de Wetering , F.Holstege , and H.Clevers , unpublished ) .
Since no additional cDNA clones of the TCF-1A type were isolated , it was expected that , at least in Jurkat and HPB-ALL , TCF-1A represents a relatively rare splicing event .
Based on the longest TCF-1B and TCF-1C clones , the sizes of the corresponding mRNAs were predicted to be at least 2.9-3.0 kb , which fitted well with the 3.0 kb size estimated from Northern blotting ( see below ) .
In two clones , an imperfect alternative polyadenylation signal ( AATTAA at bp 1348 of TCF-1B ) appeared to be utilized , which resulted in the addition of a poly-A tail at bp 1365 and at bp 1368 respectively .
Indeed , overexposures of Northern blot experiments revealed the presence of mRNA species of ~ 1400-1500 bp ( not shown ) .
An Alu repeat was present between bp 2291 and 2576 of the 3 ' untranslated sequence of TCF-1B .
A consensus polyadenylation signal ( AATAAA at bp 2796 ) was found near the 3 ' end of the longest cDNA clone , and was followed by a stretch of 7 As at bp 2836 of the longest clone .
TCF-1 is a member of an 'HMG box-family ' of DNA-binding proteins The primary TCF-1 sequence exhibited none of the amino acid motifs ( leucine-zipper , helix-loop-helix , zinc-finger , homeobox ) that have been observed in many recently identified eukaryotic transcription factors ( Johnson and McKnight , 1989 ) .
Computer-assisted searches of NBRF and Swiss Protein Sequence Databases using the Lipman/Pearson algorithm ( Lipman and Pearson , 1985 ) revealed a significant similarity of TCF-1 with Mc , one of the mating type genes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe , the fission yeast ( 23 % similarity over a stretch of 77 amino acids ) .
A slightly lower degree of similarity ( 20 % over the same stretch ) was obtained for a match with Tetrahymena LG-1 , a high mobility group-1 ( HMG-1 ) -related protein .
Similarities of borderline significance were found with HMG-1 genes of various species .
Database searches with Mc and LG-1 detected reciprocal similarities .

SRY was identified as a gene mapping to the sex-determining region of the human and murine Y chromosome , encoding a testis-specific transcript .
SRY was noted to contain a HMG box similar to that of Mc ( Sinclair et al .
, 1990 ; Gubbay et al .
, 1990 ) .
The region of homology defined by our computer searches in TCF-1 , Mc , LG-1 and HMG-1 aligned well with the HMG box sequences in UBF and in SRY .
In fact , TCP-1 showed the highest degree of similarity to the HMG box of SRY ( 27 % over 77 amino acids ) .
In addition , we detected a second HMG box in human HMG-1 .
Figure 6 depicts the alignment of the HMG boxes of all proteins mentioned in this section .
Recombinant TCF-1 and 'T cell ' TCF-1 have identical DNA-binding characteristics To confirm the identity of the putative TCF-1 cDNA clones , the binding characteristics of recombinant TCF-1A , TCF-1B , and TCF-1C were compared with that of TCF-1 present in T cell nuclear extracts .
To this end , the basic domains of the three alternative splices were subcloned into the protein A-expression vector pRIT2T ( Uhlen et al .
, 1983 ) .
After appropriate induction , the fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysates over IgG-Sepharose and tested by gel retardation analysis .
All three splice forms bound to the MW56 probe , and failed to interact with the MWS56Sac probe , indicating the importance of the AACAAAG motif for binding ( Figure 7A ) .
Subsequent methylation interference footprinting ( Figure 7B ) proved the actual contact bases to be identical to those depicted in Figure 4 for T cell-derived TCF-1 .
The TCF-1 gene is expressed in a T cell-specific fashion As a second confirmation of identity , the cell type-specific expression of the candidate TCF-1 gene was analysed by Northern hybridization , using the insert of @ TCF-1 as a probe .
RNA was extracted from cell lines of the panel used in the gel retardation analyses .
As shown in Figure 8 , hybridizing bands of approximately 3.0 kb were observed with all T cell lines , and were absent from all other cell lines .
Identical results were obtained with a full length TCF-1B probe ( not shown ) .
Thus , the presence of a signal in Northern blotting using a TCF-1 probe was completely concordant with the appearance of the TCF-1 doublet in the gel retardation assay .
Taken together , the DNA-binding characteristics and mRNA expression data indicated that the cloned gene 128 indeed encoded the CD3-e enhancer-binding protein characterized in nuclear extracts of T lymphocytes .
Recombinant TCF-1 transactivates its cognate motif To test the ability of TCF-1 to activate transcription , a full length version of TCF-1A was constructed in the eukaryotic expression vector pCDMT7 ( Aruffo and Seed , 1987 ) and cotransfected with the pMW56 ; , CAT vector into COS cells .
In five independent experiments , expression of TCF-1A resulted consistently in a 3- to 4-fold increase in measured CAT activity , as compared with cotransfection of pMW56 , with an irrelevant vector .
The outcome of a typical experiment is depicted in Table II .
The observed enhancement was in the same range as that obtained with the reporter plasmids in T cells ( see Table I ) .
No effect was seen upon co-transfection of pMW56Sac ; with the TCF-1A expression vector , indicating that the TCF-1A-mediated transactivation occurred through its cognate sequence .
In two experiments , the dependence on cognate DNA binding was confirmed by cotransfection of the CAT reporter plasmids with an internal in-frame deletion clone of TCF-1A ( TCF-1 A8 ) , which lacks part of the HMG box .
This deletion completely abrogates DNA binding in the protein A system ( not shown ) .
Consequently , no transactivation was observed with pTCF-1Ad ( Table II ) .
To control for transfection efficiency and survival of the reporter plasmid , quantitative Hirt extraction was performed at the time of assay on one-tenth of each cell sample .
Numbers of E.coli colonies were counted and are indicated in brackets behind the obtained CAT values in Table IL .
Discussion The TCF-1 gene product described in this study encodes a novel type of polymerase II transcription factor .
No homologies were found with such factors of other higher eukaryotes .
However , computer-assisted data bank searches revealed a significant similarity of the DNA-binding domain of TCF-1 to several genes with suspected or proven DNA-binding properties .
The gene most relevant to the present study is the very recently cloned polymerase I transcription factor UBF ( Jantzen et al .
, 1990 ) .
UBF controls transcription of ribosomal RNA genes by binding in a sequence-specific fashion to the Upstream Control Element of the rRNA promoter .
UBF contains four domains of moderate similarity to HMG proteins .

Recombinant TCF-1 transactivates its cognate motif in non T-cells pCDM7-TCF-IA __ pCD63 pCDM7-TCF-1Ad pTK56 , 7233 ( 48 ) 1996 ( 68 ) 2014 ( 49 ) 6422 ( 38 ) 1705 ( 52 ) 2191 ( 30 ) pTK56Sac , 1600 ( 57 ) 1841 ( 29 ) 1820 ( 31 ) 2122 ( 46 ) 1825 ( 25 ) 1590 ( 45 ) COS-1 cells were transfected with CAT vectors containing seven copies of the TCF-1 motif oligonucleotide ( pTK56 , ) , or containing seven copies of a mutant of the TCF-1 oligonucleotide which does not bind TCF-1 ( pTK56Sac : , see Table I ) .
Cotransfected with these CAT vectors were vectors expressing TCF-1A ( pCDM7-TCF-1A ) , the irrelevant CD63 membrane antigen ( pCD63 , M.Metzelaar and H.Clevers , unpublished ) , or a non-DNA-binding deletion clone of TCF-1A which lacks part of the HMG box ( pCDM7-TCF-1Ad ) .
Expression of TCF-1A in COS cells consistently resulted in a 3- to 4-fold enhancement of CAT activity , provided that the CAT vector contained the TCF-1 cognate motif .
The deletion clone of TCF-1A was inactive in this assay .
Transfections were performed in duplicate ; the results are represented as c.p.m .
of extractable ( butyrylated ) [ '*C chloramphenicol .
As a control for transfection efficiency , quantitative Hirt extraction was performed .
The obtained E.coli colonies are indicated in brackets .

boxes separated by a small linker region ) .
The most N-terminal HMG-like domain in UBF was shown to be both necessary and sufficient for sequence-specific DNA-binding .
The HMG-like protein sequence was named the HMG box , and postulated to represent a novel class of DNA-binding domain ( Jantzen et al .
, 1990 ) .
129 M. van de Wetering et al .
The presence of a single HMG box in the DNA-binding domain of TCF-1 lends strong support to this postulate .
TCF-1 appears to be highly sequence-specific : despite extensive efforts , we have so far not encountered any other sequence motifs recognized by TCF-1 ( M.Oosterwegel and H.Clevers , unpublished ) .
We are currently determining the minimal TCF-1 DNA-binding domain and its critical residues by mutational analysis .
These studies should establish the importance of the HMG box in TCF-1 for its sequence-specific DNA recognition .
The members of the HMG box family , identified so far , are of a rather diverse nature .
TCF-1 is a highly tissue-specific polymerase II transcription factor ( this report ) .
UBF is a ubiquitous polymerase I transcription factor ( Jantzen et al .
, 1990 ) .
SRY is a candidate for the sex-determining gene .
Based on the presence of an HMG box in SRY , it is proposed to act as a sequence-specific transcription factor .
No experimental data support this hypothesis as yet ( Gubbay et al .
, 1990 ; Sinclair et al .
, 1990 ) .
The Mc mating type gene of S.pombe is essential for sexual differentiation by specifying the h~ mating type of the haploid fission yeast cell .
The mode of action of the mat-Mc gene is not known , although it has been suggested to encode a DNA-binding protein based on the abundance of basic residues ( Kelly et al .
, 1988 ) .
Tetrahymena LG-1 has been studied as an HMG-1 -like protein of unknown function , possibly involved in determining the macronuclear phenotype .
No sequence-specific DNA-binding has been reported for LG-1 ( Schulman et al .
, 1987 ) .
Finally , the HMG-1 proteins are ubiquitous , abundant nuclear proteins capable of binding single- and double-stranded DNA in a relatively sequence-independent manner .
Again , the function of these proteins is unclear , although they have been implicated in chromatin assembly ( Bernues et al .
, 1986 ) and transcription control ( Tremethick and Molloy , 1986 ; Watt and Molloy , 1988 ) .
At least three alternative splice forms are generated from the TCF-1 gene .
The proteins encoded by these splice alternatives differ in their extreme C-terminus .
These differences are located near , but outside , the DNA-binding domain of TCF-1 , since they do not appear to affect DNA recognition .
However , it can not be excluded that the individual C-termini exert subtle effects on the DNA-binding domain proper , resulting in differences in affinity for variants of the AACAAAG motif .
Experiments to test this possibility will have to await the elucidation of the spectrum of sequence motifs that can be recognized by TCF-1 .
More likely however , the C-termini of TCF-1A .
-B , and -C provide surfaces for protein-protein interaction with other transcription factors bound to the same DNA template , or with non-DNA binding accessory proteins ( Johnson and McKnight , 1989 ) .
Due to differences in the ability to interact with other proteins , the splice forms of TCF-1 might differ in their effects on the functional status of a given regulatory DNA element .
Conversely , it is conceivable that the complement of transcription factors bound to a particular regulatory element selectively allows binding of only one splice form of TCF-1 .
In this scheme , each particular splice form of TCF-1 would be involved in the control of an individual ( set of ) gene ( s ) .
Whatever the reason for the existence of the TCF-1 splice forms will turn out to be , all are expressed uniquely in T lymphocytes and are therefore probably involved in T cell-specific gene expression .
The transactivational properties of TCF-1 may account for 130 the tissue-specificity of the CD3-e enhancer , but do not explain its strength .
The level of transactivation accomplished by seven copies of the TCF-1 cognate sequence is of the same order of that of a single copy of the CD3-e enhancer : S-fold to 10-fold .
In contrast , two copies of the CD3-e enhancer already result in a transactivation of at least 100-fold ( H.Clevers , unpublished ) .
These observations suggest a role for transcription factors other than TCF-1 .
Indeed , preliminary data on mutational dissection of the CD3-e enhancer have revealed the existence of at least two additional DNA elements ( M.Oosterwegel and H.Clevers , unpublished ) .
These elements interact with transcription factors that , although not ubiquitous , are more broadly expressed than TCF-1 .
The picture that emerges predicts a complex interplay of at least three factors that dictate the strength and tissue-specificity of the CD3-e enhancer .
The strategy of the present study was based upon the assumption that the study of a particular T cell gene would uncover general principles of the molecular basis of T cell differentiation .
For TCF-1 to be involved in T lymphocyte differentiation , it should control the expression of genes other than CD3-e. Several T cell- and lymphoid-specific regulatory elements have been characterized recently ( Georgopoulos et al .
, 1988 , 1990 ; Krimpenfort et al .
, 1988 ; McDougall et al .
, 1988 ; Greaves et al .
, 1989 ; Ho et al .
, 1989 ; Winoto and Baltimore , 1989 ; Bories et al .
, 1990 ; Redondo et al .
, 1990 ; reviewed in Clevers and Owen , 1990 ) .
No exact matches to the TCF-1 motif ( AAcAAAG ) appear to be present in these enhancers .
However , since recognition motifs of eukaryotic transcription factors are often degenerate ( Johnson and McKnight , 1989 ) , it is by no means excluded that TCF-1 can bind to these elements .
It will therefore be of great interest to determine if recombinant TCF-1 can recognize and transactivate any of these T cell-specific enhancers .
It might be argued that the identification of a transcription factor , itself expressed in a T cell-specific fashion , has only moved the original problem back one step .
The fact that TCF-1 does not encode a structural gene but rather a transcriptional regulator constitutes a critical difference , however .
TCF-1 might serve as an integrator of differentiation signals ( e.g .
soluble mediators , cell-cell contact ) that are received by a T cell precursor .
Such signals would be translated by surface receptors into second messengers , finally converge onto the regulatory elements of TCF-1 , and ( given an appropriate set of signals ) activate its transcription .
TCF-1 would then in turn switch on structural genes such as CD3-e .
Thus , only a single gene ( TCF-1 ) needs to be outfitted with the complex regulatory elements that can 'sense ' and integrate diffentiational signals experienced by a cell .
The subsequent activation of relevant structural genes will then result simply from the presence of a TCF-1 cognate motif in their promoters/enhancers .

In short , 5 % 10° cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA equimolar to 10 ug of TCF-1 identification and cloning pBLCAT2 for 60 min in 3 ml of RPMI with 50 ug of DEAE-dextran/ml ( non-adherent cells ) ; or for 120 min at 250 ug/ml of DEAE-dextran ( adherent cells ) .
48 h later , cells were harvested and freeze-thawed in 100 ul of 100 mM NaCI/10 mM Tris pH 7.4/1 mM EDTA .
50 pl of the lysate was added to 125 al of CAT cocktail 1 ( 60 mCi/mmol ) : 2.5 % glycerol ; 250 mM Tris pH 7.5 ; 3 mM butyryl-CoA ) , and incubated for 2 h at 37°C .
Pristane/xylene-extractable c.p.m .

To verify the presence of equal amounts of reporter plasmid at the time of assay , a quantitative Hirt extraction was performed on one-tenth of the cells .
Cells were pelleted , resuspended in 0.2 ml of 0.6 % SDS/1 mM EDTA and incubated 20 min at RT .
Subsequently 0.05 ml of SM NaCl was added , and after 6 h at 4°C , the samples were spun ( 5 min 15 000 r.p.m ) , the supernatants were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated .
Half of each sample was then transformed into E.coli .
Isolation of cDNA clones Performed essentially according to Vinson et al .

Additional clones were isolated from the Jurkat library and from an HPB-ALL library in pCDM7 by standard hybridization screening with the insert of @ TCF ( Sambrook et al .
, 1989 ) .
DNA sequencing Sequencing was performed on double stranded DNA templates according to the method of Sanger eral .
( 1977 ) using T7 DNA polymerase ( Pharmacia ) .
