Y. , B. G. L. ] Abstract Glucocorticoid receptors were studied in various populations of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes and leukemic lymphoblasts .
Normal lymphocytes contain low levels of glucocorticoid receptor ( ~2,500 sites/cell ) which are identical in T- and non-T-fractions .
Phytohemagglutinin treatment increases levels about 3-fold .
Leukemic lymphoblasts contain larger numbers of receptor sites .
Presence of receptor is correlated with in vitro sensitivity to glucocorticoids and in vivo response to therapy .
Quantity of receptor is also correlated with complete remission duration independently of leukemic cell type ( T or null ) , initial WBC , or age of patient .
Quantitative determination of glucocorticoid receptor levels in acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be of value both as an independent prognostic variable and in suggesting which patients should receive glucocorticoid therapy .
Introduction The inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on lymphoid tissues have been long appreciated ( 25 , 29 ) .
Naturally , therefore , these steroids were widely used in the management of acute leukemia when it became apparent that they could also kill leukemic lymphoblasts ( 6 , 10 ) .
Despite this useful observation there are certain difficulties in their effective use .
First , variable response rates are observed in patients with differing histological diagnoses ( 22 ) .
Secondly , many patients whose disease is initially responsive to glucocorticoids eventually relapse at a later point in their clinical course with steroid-resistant celts ( 38 ) .
Thus , while initial response rates in ALL* range between 45 and 65 % , after relapse the rate of remission induction with glucocorticoids alone falis to 25 % .
Furthermore , steroid administration is associated with a host of iatrogenic complications , including immunosuppression with concomitant nosocom-ial infections , Cushing 's syndrome , diabetes mellitus , poor wound healing , peptic ulcer disease , psychosis , and other problems ( 1 , 13 ) .
These untoward reactions become particularly vexatious when it is recalled that most leukemic and related disorders are managed by combinations of cytotoxic therapy which include glucocorticoids along with several other agents .
Thus , possibly harmful components of a drug combination may be continued long after they have ceased to be useful .
Quite obviously , it would be of value to predict ' Presented at the John E. Fogarty International Center Conference on Hormones and Cancer , March 29 to 31 , 1978 , Bethesda , Md .

NOVEMBER 1978 in advance which leukemic cells might be inhibited by glucocorticoids and thus restrict their use to beneficial situations .
Clearly , an in vitro test of glucocorticoid leukemic cell cytotoxicity would seem worthwhile , but thus far such methods have not been widely adopted ( 7 , 8 ) .
It is difficult to reliably culture leukemic cell populations and , furthermore , in vitro effects of hormones may not be as easily demonstrated as in vivo responses .
Studies performed in breast cancer supported the notion that quantification of specific steroid receptors for estrogen was useful in predicting response to endocrine therapy ( 23 ) .
Based upon this fact , plus a clearer understanding of the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids ( 26 , 35 ) , it appeared worthwhile to examine human leukemic cells for the presence of glucocorticoid receptors and to see whether their presence was correlated with glucocorticoid responsiveness .
This study briefly summarizes our prior work in characterizing the glucocorticoid receptors of human leukemic cells and outlines some of our more recent data correlating steroid receptors with clinical features of the patients ' illness .
Much of our eartier work has recently been reviewed ( 16 ) , and for this reason most of our effort will be aimed at presenting more recent studies .
Glucocorticoid Receptors in ALL Because of the high initial response rate of ALL to glucocorticoids and general patient availability , we initially chose to examine cells from these patients for glucocorticoid receptors ( 19-21 ) .
With the use of a competitive protein binding assay on cytoplasmic extracts prepared from either viably frozen or fresh lymphoblasts , it was possible to demonstrate saturable binding of radiolabeled glucocorticoid .
All samples from patients with untreated ALL contained saturable receptor sites which ranged in concentration between about 0.12 and 0.8 pmol [ °H ] dexamethasone bound per mg of cytoplasmic protein .
We estimated about 1 x 10-® mg of cytoplasmic protein per cell ( based on cell count and Lowry protein determination ) .
This would correspond to between about 1,000 and 8,000 sites/cell .
The binding data obtained , when plotted with the use of the Scatchard tech-nique , were best fitted by a straight line , suggesting that binding was to a class of receptor sites of uniform affinity .
The equilibrium dissociation constant ( K , , ) of this receptor ranged between 2 and 8 nm in various experiments when [ *HIdexamethasone was used as the ligand and was increased about 10-fold when [ *HJcortisol was employed .
An equilibrium dissociation constant not significantly different from those values was obtained from the quotient of the measured association and dissociation rate constants ( 19 ) .
This suggested that true equilibrium conditions were met with the use of our assay methodology .
This binding component was sensitive to proteolytic digestion with trypsin , 4251 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

chymotrypsin , or papain , but resistant to RNase , DNase , and phospholipase A , C , or D treatments , suggesting that the receptor was a protein .
Mercuric chloride preincubation obliterated specific binding while sulfhydryl reagents and glycerol up to 20 % concentration stabilized binding activity .
While high-affinity binding is certainly an important criterion for a steroid receptor , it alone is insufficient to establish with certainty that the binding component is functioning as a receptor .
For example , plasma transport proteins such as transcortin or corticosteroid-binding globulin can also bind natural glucocorticoid with high affinity .
For this reason the specificity of binding was examined in detail ( 19 ) .
All biologically active glucocorticoids tested competed with either [ *H ] cortisol or [ *H ) } dexamethasone for binding .
Unlabeled triamcinolone and dexamethasone , fluorinated synthetic glucocorticoids with very low affinity for corticosteroid-binding globulin , showed a higher apparent affinity for the receptor than did cortisol itself .
This parallels their known increased biological potency .
The receptor showed little apparent affinity for compounds without glucocorticoid activity such as metabolites ( tetrahydrocortisol ) or inactive stereoisomers ( 11a-hydroxycortisol ) .
Both progesterone and cortexolone , which are inactive as glucocorticoids but act as antiinducers in rodent lymphoid cells ( 26 ) , were effective competitors for binding .
In addition , the cytosolic binding component readily distinguished between cortisone and cortisol or prednisone and prednisolone , showing that reduction of the 11-keto group ( which is necessary for biological activity ) is necessary for optimal binding .
Thus , there are close correlations between extent of binding and biological effect .
Using this cytoplasmic assay we examined the leukemic blast cells of 22 patients for cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor .
All patients had some detectable receptor ( minimum 0.12 pmol [ °H ] dexamethasone bound per mg of cytoplasmic protein ) .
Average binding in these untreated patients was 0.31 + 0.1 ( S.D . )
pmol per mg cytosol protein .
All of these patients subsequently responded to an initial attempt at induction chemotherapy with a drug combination including glucocorticoid .
Six other patients were studied at the time of leukemic relapse .
At this time , leukemic cells were studied prior to a reinduction attempt with a drug combination including a glucocorticoid .
These 6 patients subsequently achieved a complete remission on this therapy .
Their average glucocorticoid binding activity was 0.30 + 0.12 pmol of [ *H ] dexamethasone per mg of cytoplasmic protein , a value not significantly different from that in previously untreated patients .
Six additional patients were studied at the time of relapse who subsequently failed to achieve a remission on an identical drug combination which included glucocorticoid .
Glucocorticoid binding activity in these patients was 0.015 + 0.0095 pmol [ °H ] dexamethasone bound per mg of cytoplasmic protein .
One patient was studied on 3 separate occasions ( his initial presentation , first relapse , and second relapse ) .
Induction therapy was attempted with the identical drug combination , including prednisolone in each case .
At presentation , binding activity was 0.32 , at first relapse 0.40 , and at second relapse 0 pmol [ °H ] dexamethasone bound per mg of cytoplasmic protein .
Induction was successful initially and at the time of first relapse , but the patient showed no benefi- 4252 cial response to therapy on the second attempt at reinduction therapy .
With the exception of this particular patient , one can not conclude that the intervening therapy had selected out a subpopulation of receptor deficient cells .
As will be shown later , it is probable that in some cases relapse may occur in association with preexistent low receptor levels .
Thus , there appeared to be a good correlation between response to therapy and the presence of glucocorticoid receptor .
This is a somewhat surprising result given the fact that these patients were not managed with single agent therapy , but received drug combinations including agents which have no apparent biochemical cross-resist-ance with glucocorticoids ( vincristine , methotrexate , and 6-mercaptopurine ) .
Thus , resistance to glucocorticoids would not necessarily be correlated with either resistance to other components of the drug combination employed or failure to observe a clinical response .
In order to learn the biological significance of these receptor levels we sought to quantitate the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on human leukemic blast cells with the use of a direct in vitro assay .
Since inhibition of nucleoside incorporation had been shown by other investigators to be an early effect of glucocorticoids on responsive lymphoid cells ( 28 , 34 ) , we measured [ °H ] thymidine incorporation in short-term cultures of human leukemic lymphoblasts in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of glucocorticoid .
Unfortunately , these experiments could not be accomplished in every patient .
However , in patients whose cells contained binding activity there was a close correlation between concentrations of glucocorticoid which inhibited nucleoside incorporation and concentrations which bound to receptor sites ( 19 , 20 ) .
Furthermore , we never observed inhibition of nucleoside incorporation by phar-macologically relevant concentrations of glucocorticoids in leukemic blast cells from patients which lacked binding activity .
Surprisingly , we never failed to observe inhibition when cytoplasmic binding was present .
This was an unanticipated result , given the many steps in steroid hormone action distal to the initial binding reaction ( 35 ) which potentially might be interfered with and yet leave behind cytoplasmic binding activity .
We have subsequently described a human ALL cell line in tissue culture in which although there is cytoplasmic binding activity , there are no demonstrable biological effects of glucocorticoids on amino acid pools , glucose uptake , macromolecular synthe-sis , or growth ( 21 ) .
Subsequently , various mouse lymphoma variants or mutants derived from a steroid-sensitive mouse lymphoma line ( $ 49 ) have been extensively characterized by several workers ( 2 , 31 , 32 , 39 ) .
Most of the glucocorticoid-resistant clones were defective in binding activity , and in all of the remaining clones a receptor defect could also be invoked as a potential explanation for hormone unre-sponsiveness .
Whatever the explanation for the common-ness of receptor defects in glucocorticoid-resistant leukemic cells , it is nonetheless quite interesting that in our own work there is such a close linkage between receptor activity and clinical responsiveness , not only to glucocorticoids in vitro but also drug to combinations in general .
The notion that glucocorticoid binding activity might be important in predicting response to other cytotoxic agents is suggested by these data and will receive further substantia- CANCER RESEARCH VOL .

tion in the data presented below .
Glucocorticoid Receptors in Normal Human Lymphocytes First , however , we would like to summarize a few of our studies which characterize the glucocorticoid receptors of normal human lymphocytes ( 18 , 27 ) .
We had originally noted ( 19 ) that lymphocytes collected from normal human volunteers appeared to have very low levels of glucocorticoid receptor when measured by a cytoplasmic assay ( 0.03 + 0.025 pmol [ °H } dexamethasone per mg cytoplasmic protein ) .
By determining cytoplasmic protein content on a per-cell basis , this would be equivalent to about 1500 glucocorticoid binding sites/cell .
For a variety of reasons it seemed reasonable to repeat and extend these studies to purified populations and subpopulations of human lymphocytes .
To do this , we switched to a whole cell assay methodology because we felt that this assay would be more rapid , more sensitive , and might allow detection of binding sites which were noncytoplasmic .
This assay has been extensively validated ( 15 ) .
With the use of such a methodology , glucocorticoid receptor activity is readily demonstrable in normal human lymphocytes essentially free of polymorphonuciear leukocyte and other mononuclear cell contamination ( greater than 99.5 % small lymphocytes ) .
Homo and colleagues ( 11 ) , using a similar assay , have also been able to demonstrate glucocorticoid receptors in normal human lymphocytes .
They used a Ficoll-Hypaque technique ( 4 ) to separate mononuclear cells ; however , such preparations contain significant amounts ( up to 10 % ) of monocytes .
As described later , we have shown that these monocytes contain more than 7000 glucocorticoid receptor sites/cell ( 18 ) .
We found that small peripheral blood lymphocytes contain about 2300 glucocorticoid sites/cell which , in terms of affinity for [ *H } dexamethasone ( K , , 2 to 4 nm ) and specificity studies , are perfectly typical of other glucocorticoid receptors .
When these cells are stimulated with the mitogen phytohemagglutinin , there is about a 3-fold increase in glucocorticoid receptor activity on a per-cell basis ( 27 ) .
Induction occurs after about a 10- to 12-hr lag .
This induction of glucocorticoid binding activity can be totally inhibited by concurrent incubation with either actinomycin D or cycioheximide .
These studies have been confirmed by others ( 33 ) .
While both `` resting `` and lectin-stimulated lymphocytes can be inhibited by glucocorticoids , the degree of inhibition is far higher in the stimulated cells ; however , when measured relatively crudely , the sensitivity to hormone is unaltered .
However , one might predict that when a given biological effect depends upon the quantity of hormone receptor complex which is formed , rather than for any given ambient hormone concentration , the cell with the highest receptor concentration would have the highest concentration of hormone receptor complexes , other factors being equal .
Thus cells with higher receptor concentrations might be differentially more sensitive to glucocorticoids .
Elsewhere in this symposium , a report from the laboratory of Bourgeois et al .
( 3 ) elegantly confirms this hypothesis .
These increases in receptor have been suggested to be due to variations in receptor content with different phases of the cell cycle .
Cidlowski and Michaels ( 5 ) have suggested that in synchronized HeLa cells in NOVEMBER 1978 Glucocorticoid Receptors and Leukemia culture there is a doubling of the receptor content on a per-cell basis as the cells pass through late G , .
In our studies , phytohemagglutinin stimulates an increase in glucocorticoid receptor activity occurring between 14 and 20 hr , which is well in advance of the entrance of these cells into the DNA-synthetic phase of the cell cycle ( 36 ) .
These purified lymphocytes consist of about 65 to 75 % T-cells and 20 to 30 % B-cells .
We have recently attempted to further characterize subpopulations of normal human lymphocytes for 2 reasons ( first , because of the known differential effects of glucocorticoids on different limbs of the immune system ( 9 ) and , secondly , as an attempt to explain differences in receptor content in various subsets of human leukemic blast cells ) .
With the use of rosetting techniques , highly purified populations of T- , non-T- , and mononuclear cells were obtained from human peripheral blood , and glucocorticoid binding activity was determined ( 18 ) .
Results are shown in Table 1 .
There is no difference in either T- or non-T-receptor content on a per-cell basis or in affinity for glucocorticoid .
Specificity of the binding site for various steroids was very similar as well .
Mononuclear cells had about 7,000 sites/ cell .
Nonstimulated T- and non-T-populations of human lymphocytes showed an approximately equal degree of inhibition by glucocorticoids when overall precursor incorporation into macromolecules was measured .
Interference with specific immune function such as performance in cytotoxicity assays or immunoglobulin production was not measured .
Our data suggest that the differential effects of glucocorticoids on the immune system do not appear to be mediated by differences in glucocorticoid receptor content in these cells .
Glucocorticoid Receptors in Subsets of Human ALL Recently , we have reexamined glucocorticoid receptors in ALL and attempted to correlate glucocorticoid receptor levels with different cell subpopulations ( 14 , 15 ) .
Approximately one-fifth of patients with ALL have lymphoblasts which will form spontaneous rosettes with sheep erythrocytes and are therefore termed T-derived lymphoblasts .
These patients will have a disease which frequently presents differently ( e.g .
, mediastinal masses ) and which is more aggressive in that there are very few long-term survivors ( 12 , 30 , 37 ) .
The majority of patients have lymphoblasts which lack identifiable cell surface markers ( termed null cells ) .
We have previously shown that lymphoblasts that make E-rosettes usually share with normal human E-ro-sette-forming cells the inability to stimulate allogeneic re-sponders in the mixed-lymphocyte culture .
We have postulated that the inability or loss of ability to stimulate in mixed-lymphocyte culture may represent maturation along Table 1 Glucocorticoid receptors in subpopulations of human leukocytes No .

the pathway of T-cell differentiation .
We therefore subdivide null lymphoblasts into 2 categories , according to whether or not they stimulate in mixed-lymphocyte culture , for the purpose of analysis in this paper .
We have compared glucocorticoid receptor levels in these subtypes of ALL and have determined their relationship to other prognostic variables in these patients .
Glucocorticoid receptors are readily detectable in T- and null leukemic cells .
By either affinity criteria ( K , ~ 4 nm for [ °H ] dexamethasone ) or binding specificity studies , T- and null cell leukemic cells are indis-tinguishable .
However , there are significant differences in receptor content between these cells .
Null cells from 18 patients which stimulate in mixed-lymphocyte culture ( N+ ) have a median receptor content of 7,571 sites/cell , a mean of 10,117 , and a range of 4,096 to 21,869 sites/cell .
Nine patients had null cells which did not stimulate in mixed-lymphocyte culture ( N- ) .
Cells of these patients had a median of 4,484 sites/cell , with a mean of 6,729 and a range of 2,936 to 16,469 .
Nine patients whose T-lymphoblasts were studied had a median of 2,173 sites/cell , a mean of 2,538 and a range of 0 to 5,887 .
T-lymphoblasts differ significantly by 2-tailed test from N+ lymphoblasts ( p < 0.001 ) , as well as N- lymphoblasts ( p < 0.01 ) .
Some important patient characteristics as a function of receptor content are shown in Table 2 .
Cells from a total of 45 patients eventually were examined for cell surface markers and glucocorticoid receptor content , and these data were collated with clinical information from these patients .
Eleven patients with low levels of receptor ( less than 2,500 sites/cell ) all had T-lymphoblasts .
Seven patients with T- and 11 with null |ymphobilasts had intermediate receptor levels of greater than 2,500 , but less than 6,000 , sites/cell .
Sixteen patients with high receptor levels ( greater than 6,000 sites/cell ) had null lymphoblasts .
Patients with T-cell leukemia tend to be older , as has been previously shown .
Patients with T-cell ALL with lower receptor levels had higher WBC than did patients with the same cell type who had higher receptor levels .
We next examined the effect of receptor level on initial complete remission induction and duration .
Chart 1 shows the results for patients with T-lymphoblasts .
Eleven patients had less than 2,500 receptor sites/cell , and 7 patients had between 2,500 and 6,000 sites/cell .
Two patients in each group failed to achieve a complete remission .
While curves for remission duration are not quite significantly different ( 0.05 < p < 0.1 ) when only patients achieving complete remission are considered , the 2 groups are significantly different with respect to complete remission duration .
All 11 patients with low receptor levels have relapsed , while 3 to 7 patients with intermediate receptor levels remain in remission .

As shown , null-cell patients with high levels of receptor do significantly better ( p < 0.02 ) than patients with intermediate receptor values .
If Charts 1 and 2 are compared , it can be seen that the curves for either T- or null-cell patients with intermediate levels of glucocorticoid receptor are virtually superimposa-ble .
Independent of cell type , glucocorticoid receptor level was strongly correlated with remission duration .
Results are shown in Chart 3 .
Eleven patients with receptor levels of 0 to 2,500 sites/cell had a median complete remission duration of 7.6 months .
The relative relapse rate when compared to the combined groups is 2.76 , and all 11 patients have relapsed .
Eighteen patients with intermediate receptor levels ( 7 T and 11 null ) had a median remission duration of 21.4 months .
The relative relapse rate of these patients is 1.1 .
Sixteen patients ( all null-cell type ) with high receptor levels have a median remission duration in excess of 30.4 months .
The relative relapse rate is 0.42 .

test for trend .
High WBC at the time of initial presentation is well correlated with a poor prognosis in ALL .
For this reason we examined remission duration and survival for the 21 patients with initial WBC in excess of 20,000 .
Effects of receptor level on remission duration for this subset of patients are shown in Chart 4 .
For either T- or null-cell patients with blasts with less than 6,000 sites/cell , the median remission duration was 8 months , and all patients have relapsed .
For the 7 patients with blasts with greater than 6,000 sites/cell ( all null ) , the median remission duration is 25 months , and 3 of 7 remain in remission at 31 , 66 , and 74 months , respectively .
Interestingly , the 2 null-cell groups are equivalent with respect to age and WBC .
Thus , the only identified difference between them is their receptor level .

In contrast , in patients with blasts with greater than 6,000 sites/cell ( all null ) , the median survival is not yet reached , but is currently greater than 31 months , with 4 of 7 patients still alive and 3 in initial remission .
Conclusion We conclude that patients with high receptor levels tend to have null-cell ALL and a long remission duration .
Patients with low receptor levels have T-lymphoblasts and a short remission duration .
Patients with intermediate receptor levels had an intermediate and identical remission duration , regardless of cell type .
Thus , glucocorticoid receptor levels appear to have clinical significance independent of age , WBC , or cell type .
Whether their entire prognostic significance is being mediated by their relationship to glucocorticofd Tesponsiveness is not known .
It is certainly possible that the presence of these binding proteins may simply be an important biological marker associated with other factors which are related to chemotherapy response such as rate of growth of biochemical differentiation .
Some support for this latter contention is derived from recent studies in breast cancer .
It has been shown that breast tumors with higher mitotic and thymidine labeling indices tend to be estrogen receptor negative ( 24 ) .
In addition we have recently shown that there is a strong association between lack of estrogen receptor and response to chemotherapy ( 17 ) .
The point to be made is that specific steroid hormone receptors may be of value in allowing biochemical subcategorization of some human cancers and that these subsets may be associated with important biological and clinical differences .
