Box 100 , Cold Spring Harbor , NY 11724 Communicated by Michael H. Wigler , May 2 , 1990 ( received for review February 26 , 1990 ) ABSTRACT Mammalian cells express two distinct forms of transcription factor CREB ( cAMP response element binding protein ) that are apparently the products of alternative splicing of the CREB gene transcript .
The two proteins differ by a 14-amino acid serine-rich insertion present in one of the CREB isoforms .
We show that both CREB isoforms are expressed in many cell types and mammalian species .
Both encode proteins that bind specifically to a cAMP response element in vitro .
As expected for proteins of this class , the CREB proteins bind DNA as dimers .
Both proteins impart cAMP-regulated transcriptional activity to a heterologous DNA-binding domain , showing that cAMP directly modulates the transcriptional stimulatory activity of CREB .
The presence of multiple CREB isoforms with identical DNA-binding specificities but differences in the presumed regulatory domain raises the possibility that CREB proteins may be able to integrate distinct regulatory signals at the level of gene transcription .
cAMP is an example of a `` second messenger `` that relays extracellular signals to intracellular targets .
Elevation of intracellular cAMP concentrations leads to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) and subsequently to changes in the pattern of cellular gene transcription ( 1 ) .
Activation of PKA is both necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional response to cAMP ( 2-5 ) .
Most genes induced by cAMP share a conserved DNA sequence that constitutes a cAMP-responsive element ( CRE ) ( for review , see ref .
6 ) .
Mammalian cells contain multiple proteins that bind this sequence ( see , for example , refs .
7-12 ) .
One of these proteins , CREB ( cAMP response element binding protein ) ( 7 , 8 ) , is a 43-kDa phosphoprotein that is a substrate for PKA in vitro ( 8 ) .
Mutation of the serine residue phosphorylated by PKA prevents activation of CREB by PKA in vitro ( 13 ) .
Two cDNAs encoding CREB have recently been isolated-one from a human placenta library ( 11 ) and a second from a rat brain library ( 12 ) .
The two clones encode highly related proteins that differ primarily by a 14-amino acid region found only in the rat clone .
This difference could be due to species or tissue specificity , and its functional significance is not known .
We report here on the isolation of CREB cDNA clones from a human T-cell cDNA library .
?
We establish that both CREB isoforms are expressed ubiquitously and describe the properties of the proteins encoded by the two cDNAs .
MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA Isolation .
CREB cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human peripheral blood T-cell cDNA library in Agt10 ( ref .
14 ; extracted phage DNA kindly provided by C. Nicolet , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ) , The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .
This article must therefore be hereby marked `` advertisement `` in accordance with 18 U.S.C .
§1734 solely to indicate this fact .
5258 using two oligonucleotides that carried sequence complementary to the first and last 20 nucleotides of the CREB open reading frame , respectively ( 11 ) .
Amplification reaction mixtures ( 100 wl ) contained 70 ng of library DNA , 100 pmol of each phosphorylated oligonucleotide , and 2.5 units of Ther-mus aquaticus DNA polymerase ( Taq polymerase ) ( Perkin-Elmer/Cetus ) .
The amplification cycle was 1 min at 94°C , 1 min at 65°C , 5 min at 74°C , and it was repeated for a total of 35 cycles .
The l-kilobase CREB cDNA fragment was the major product of the reaction .
The CREB cDNA fragment was cloned in pBSM13+ ( Stratagene ) .
Eight independent clones carrying CREB inserts were fully sequenced by using a set of oligonucleotide primers based on a published CREB sequence ( 11 ) .
All eight clones were fully sequenced on one strand , while one clone of each class was also fully sequenced on the opposite strand .
Other Constructions .
To construct the probe plasmid for RNase protection assays of CREB mRNA , a 176-base-pair ( bp ) Hae III fragment of the CREB-B cDNA was cloned into the HinclI site of pBSM13+ .
Mutagenesis of the c-fos promoter to convert its natural CRE to a GAL4 binding site was performed by site-directed mutagenesis ( 15 ) .
The parental plasmid was a c-fos , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion plasmid carrying c-fos sequences from -71 to +109 and six tandem repeats of a synthetic simian virus 40 enhancer element ( 16 ) .
The GAL4 sequence used ( see Fig .
5 ) was based on Webster et al .
( 17 ) .
To construct the GAL4-CREB fusion protein expression plasmids , we placed the entire CREB open reading frame downstream of the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain [ GAL4 , 1-147 ; originally derived from the plasmid pMA424 ( 18 ) ] .
The fusion protein was expressed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and 5'-untranslated sequences from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene .
The structure of this plasmid is shown in Fig .
5 ; details of this construction are available upon request .
RNA Analysis .
Methods for transient expression assays and RNA analysis have been described ( 16 ) .
RNA from mouse tissues was a gift from M. Steinhelper , L. Field , and J. Skowronski ( Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ) .
In Vitro Translation Assays .
Templates for in vitro transcription of CREB cDNAs were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of single-stranded phagemid DNA .
Amplification yielded a double-stranded fragment carrying the CREB cDNA linked to adjacent bacteriophage promoters .
For preparing truncated CREB proteins , we prepared oligonucleotides that hybridized to CREB DNA at the desired locations ( see Fig .
4 ) and carried at the 5 ' end a T7 RNA polymerase promoter .
These were used as primers Abbreviations : PKA , cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ; CRE , cAMP response element ; CREB , cAMP response element binding protein ; IBMX , isobutylmethylxanthine .

*The sequence reported in this paper has been deposited in the GenBank data base ( accession no .

Biochemistry : Berkowitz and Gilman in polymerase chain reactions in conjunction with a primer that hybridized to the 3 ' end of the CREB coding sequence .
Approximately 1 ug of each amplified fragment was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase .
The resulting RNAs were translated in vitro by using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Promega ) in the presence of [ *S ) methionine .
Mobility-shift assays were carried out as described ( 16 ) .
RESULTS Two Distinct CREB cDNAs .
To study the role of CREB in the control of c-fos transcription of cAMP ( 16 ) , we wished to obtain a full-length CREB cDNA .
We designed oligonucleotides corresponding to the first seven and last seven codons of the human CREB sequence obtained by Hoeffler et al .
( 11 ) and used these oligonucleotides in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify CREB cDNAs from a human peripheral blood T-cell cDNA .
The amplified DNA was cloned into a plasmid vector and eight isolates were completely sequenced .
The eight clones fell into two distinct groups that differed by a 42-bp insertion present in three of the eight clones .
In addition , we noted 13 nucleotide substitutions that were unique to individual clones , which we presume are due to misincorporation by Taq polymerase during amplification .
Because each substitution was found in only a single isolate , consensus nucleotides at each position were easily established .
Fig .
1 shows the consensus nucleotide sequences of the two CREB cDNAs .
The cDNA termed CREB-A was identical in sequence to that reported by Hoeffler et al .
( 11 ) except for a region spanning amino acids 57-64 , where our sequence showed five substitutions and one inserted amino acid relative to the reported sequence .
In each case , the amino acids encoded at these positions in our clones matched those found in the rat clone ( 12 ) .
The second cDNA , termed CREB-B , contained a 42-bp insertion , encoding 14 additional amino acids beginning at amino acid 88 and resuming CREB-A sequence at amino acid 102 .
This precise 14-amino acid stretch is found in an identical position in the rat cDNA .
Except for this insertion , the two human cDNAs were identical in nucleotide sequence .
Thus , two distinct forms of human CREB are apparently encoded by alternate transcripts of a single gene .
The discrepancy between the two previously reported sequences ( 11 , 12 ) is not due to species differences .
Both CREB mRNAs Are Ubiquitously Expressed .
To study the pattern of expression of the two CREB mRNAs , we prepared an RNase protection probe that spanned the CREB 1 Mo To MOOE $ 0 G A ORO N Q Q0 so 6 0 Do A A ovo t oR Proc .

USA 87 ( 1990 ) 5259 B insert .
CREB-B mRNA can hybridize contiguously to the probe , leading to protection of the entire CREB sequence in the probe .
Hybridization to CREB-A mRNA loops out the insert region of the probe , which is cleaved by RNase Tl to generate two smaller probe fragments , only the larger of which is seen in the figures .
Thus , probe fragments protected by the two mRNAs were easily resolved by gel electrophoresis .
Fig .
2A shows that both mRNAs were observed in several human cell lines , including H9 and Jurkat T lymphoblasts , WI-38 fibroblasts , HeLa , and HepG2 hepatoma cells .
In addition , full protection of identical probe fragments was observed in RNA samples from several rodent cell lines , including rat 208F fibroblasts , BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts , and mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma stem cells and differentiated cultures .
Thus , both CREB mRNAs were expressed simultaneously in all these cell lines .
In general , CREB-A mRNA was expressed at severalfold higher levels than CREB-B mRNA .
Because we could obtain protection of the full human CREB probe with mouse RNA , we also surveyed a variety of mouse tissues .
Again , both CREB mRNAs were expressed in all tissues examined , with CREB-A mRNA being more abundant ( Fig .
2B ) .
CREB-B mRNA appeared to be especially abundant in brain .
The main conclusion from this analysis is that both CREB mRNAs are widely expressed and that there is no striking tissue specificity to their expression .
Both cDNAs Encode Proteins That Bind a CRE in Vitro .
To determine whether both cDNAs encode CREBs , we transcribed both cDNAs into mRNA with T7 RNA polymerase and translated the mRNAs in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate .
Fig .
3A shows that both mRNAs encode proteins with apparent molecular masses of ~45 kDa , consistent with the reported size of the purified rat protein ( 7 ) .
Fig .
3B shows a mobility-shift assay of the proteins translated in vitro .
The probe carries a CRE from the mouse c-fos promoter ( 16 ) .
Translation products from both mRNAs yield strong CRE binding activities not detectable in control lysates ( compare lanes 2-7 with lanes 8-10 ) .
These complexes closely comigrated with the major complex observed with nuclear extracts from H9 T lymphoblasts ( lane 1 ) .
The complexes are sequence specific , because they did not form with a similar probe carrying four nucleotide substitutions that inactivate the CRE ( 16 ) ( lanes 11 and 12 ) .
Thus , both CREB mRNAs encode proteins that are functional in DNA-binding assays in vitro .
CREB belongs to the `` leucine zipper `` family of DNA-binding proteins ( for review , see ref .
19 ) .

( B ) RNase protection analysis of CREB mRNAs in mouse tissues .
The tissues examined are shown above the gel ( lanes 1-11 ) ; 10 ug of RNA was assayed .
Lanes 12-15 , control hybridizations performed with in vitro-transcribed CREB-A and CREB-B mRNAs .
Each panel is derived from a single gel from which empty space was removed to conserve space .
in basic amino acids N terminal to the leucine zipper .
To determine whether CREB proteins behaved similarly , we prepared a series of N-terminal truncations by in vitro transcription and translation of polymerase chain reaction-amplified templates .
Fig .
4 shows the mobility-shift complexes obtained with full-length CREB-A ( lane 2 ) and CREB-B ( lane 11 ) proteins .
Lanes 3-6 show the complexes obtained with N-terminally truncated CREB-B proteins .
A truncation beginning at the insert had no detectable DNA-binding activity ( lane 3 ) , although significant levels of the 256-amino acid protein were synthesized ( data not shown ) .
Whether this represents a specific regulatory effect of the insert or a nonspecific folding problem is not yet clear .
A shorter protein carrying the C-terminal 202 amino acids was fully active , yielding a faster migrating complex ( lane 4 ) .
A 69-residue protein beginning just N terminal to the basic region retained specific DNA-binding activity ( lane 6 ) .
A protein lacking the basic region but retaining the leucine zipper ( 45 amino acids ) was not active for DNA binding ( lane 6 ) .
To determine whether the CREB proteins formed dimers , we cotranslated full-length CREB-A mRNA with truncated CREB-B mRNAs .
In two cases , complexes of intermediate mobility were observed ( lanes 8 and 10 , arrows ) , showing that the active binding species is a dimer .
When CREB-A mRNA was @ ne soe aa em cotranslated with the two CREB-B truncations that were not active as homodimers , no heterodimeric protein-DNA complexes were observed ( lanes 7 and 10 ) .
However , in the case of the 256-amino acid CREB-B truncation , the yield of CREB-A homodimer complex was substantially reduced , suggesting that the truncated CREB-B protein may still be competent for dimerization , yielding heterodimers with no DNA-binding activity .
Thus , these experiments show that CREB binds DNA as a dimer .
They further suggest that CREB-A : CREB-B heterodimers may form , but we have not demonstrated this directly with full-length proteins .
Similar studies were recently reported by Dwarki et al .
( 26 ) .
Both CREB mRNAs Encode Proteins That Impart cAMP-Responsiveness to a Heterologous DNA-Binding Domain in Vivo .
In vivo assay of the activities of these proteins encoded by these cDNAs is complicated by the presence of CREB and related activities in all of the cell lines we examined .
More-over , we wished to separate cAMP effects on CREB transcriptional activity from any possible effects on DNA bind-ing .
Therefore , we reprogrammed the DNA-binding specificity of the CREB proteins by fusing the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 ( 18 ) to the N terminus of the CREB proteins .
The fusion proteins contained the first 147 amino acids of the GAL4 protein , Fig .

followed by 7 linker amino acids that included several potential helix breakers , and then the entire CREB proteins , including the DNA-binding domain and leucine zipper .
To assay the transcriptional activities of these proteins in vivo , we used site-directed mutagenesis to convert the CRE in a c-fos promoter derivative to a GALA binding site ( Fig .
5 ) .
We transfected this test plasmid into BALB/c 3T3 cells together with plasmids that expressed the GAL4-CREB fusion proteins from a viral promoter .
Also included in the transfections was a plasmid encoding the human a-globin gene , which served as an internal control for transfection efficiency and RNA recovery .
The transfected cells were starved for serum for 48 hr and subsequently treated for 1 hr with isobutyl-methylxanthine ( IBMX ) ( a phosphodiesterase inhibitor ) and forskolin ( an activator of adenylate cyclase ) .
Total cytoplasmic RNA was harvested and assayed for correctly initiated c-fos and globin transcripts by RNase protection .
Fig .
5 shows that whereas the wild-type A-71 c-fos promoter was strongly induced by IBMX and forskolin ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , the construct in which the c-fos CRE was substituted with a GAL4 site was not [ lanes 3 and 4 ; the small induction seen in this and other control lanes is likely due to the influence of CRE-like sequences present in vector DNA upstream of the c-fos promoter ( 16 ) ] .
When this substituted c-fos promoter was cotransfected with a plasmid expressing full-length yeast GAL4 protein , its activity was augmented in the presence and absence of stimuli ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , showing that the promoter carries an active GAL4 binding site and can Proc .

When cotransfected with plasmids expressing either of the full-length GAL4-CREB fusion proteins , the substituted c-fos promoter became strongly cAMP-responsive ( lanes 7-10 ) .
Thus , the presence of these fusion proteins converted the GAL4 binding site into a CRE .
To show that this effect required the expression of fusion proteins in trans , we prepared a small insertion by filling in a BstXI site near the 5 ' end of the CREB cDNA , shifting the reading frame .

Functional assay of CREBs in vivo .
Indicated combinations of indicator and expressor plasmids were transiently transfected into duplicate cultures of BALB/c 3T3 cells .
Transfections contained 10 ug of indicator plasmid , 100 ng of expressor plasmid , and 2 ug of a-globin internal control plasmid .
Two days after transfection , one culture from each pair was treated with IBMX and forskolin ( lanes + ) .
Indicator plasmids carried either a wild-type CRE ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , an inactive mutant CRE ( lanes 13 and 14 ) , or a GAL4 binding site in place of the CRE ( lanes 3-12 ) .
Expressor plasmids expressed full-length yeast GAL4 protein ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
GAL4-CREB-A fusion ( lanes 7 , 8 , 13 , and 14 ) , GAL4-CREB-B fusion ( lanes 9 and 10 ) , GAL4-CREB-B with a frameshift mutation ( lanes 11 and 12 ) .
Equal amounts of RNA from transfected cells were assayed by RNase protection as described ( 18 , 20 ) .
Half of the hybridization reactions were analyzed to verify that endogenous c-fos induction was equivalent in all samples .
Subsequently , the remaining portions of the hybridization were run on a second gel ( shown here ) with the amounts adjusted to equalize the signals from the internal control .

5262 Biochemistry : Berkowitz and Gilman expresses a protein in which only 15 amino acids of CREB are fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain .
Cotransfection of this plasmid did not lead to cAMP induction of the substituted c-fos promoter ( lanes 11 and 12 ) .
To show that the effect of the fusion proteins required a specific binding site in cis , we cotransfected an active GAL4-CREB plasmid with a c-fos promoter in which the CRE was substituted with sequences that inactivated the site without creating a GAL4 binding site .
This promoter did not respond to cAMP ( lanes 13 and 14 ) .
We conclude that both CREB cDNAs encode cAMP-responsive transcription factors that can act in trans through a heterologous DNA-binding domain .
Under our experimental con-ditions , we did not detect consistent differences in activity between the two forms of CREB .
DISCUSSION We report here on the isolation of two distinct cDNAs that encode CREB proteins .
Both proteins are active as DNA-binding proteins in vitro and as cAMP-dependent and -independent transcriptional activators in vivo .
The proteins are capable of forming homodimers and possibly het-erodimers , suggesting that in vivo , there could be three distinct forms of CREB-two homodimers and one het-erodimer .
The two cDNAs correspond to cDNAs previously isolated separately from human placenta and rat brain ( 11 , 12 ) .
Our results show that the difference between the original CREB isolates is not due to tissue or species specificity .
Both mRNAs are widely expressed in human and rodent cells .
These mRNAs are most likely alternative splicing products of the same primary transcript .
Polymerase chain reaction analysis of human placental DNA showed that there is a small intron ( ~500 bp ) located precisely at the 5 ' end of the insert region in CREB genomic DNA ( L .
A.B .
, unpublished data ) .
Using a different experimental strategy , Gonzalez and Montminy ( 13 ) have recently shown that the rat homolog of CREB-B can augment induction of a CRE-containing promoter by cotransfected PKA catalytic subunit in murine F9 embryonal carcinoma cells .
This transcriptional activity is dependent on an intact PKA phosphorylation site in CREB , strongly suggesting that PKA directly regulates CREB function by phosphorylation in vivo .
This activation could reflect changes in either CREB DNA-binding or transcriptional activity .
Our experiments show that both forms of CREB can confer cAMP-regulated transcriptional activation to a heterologous DNA-binding domain .
Thus , increased concentrations of cAMP , presumably acting through PKA , must influence the transcriptional stimulatory properties of CREB .
After this manuscript was submitted , Yamamoto et al .
( 21 ) reported characterization of the rat homologues of two CREB isoforms described here .
In contrast to our results , they observed a large difference in the transcriptional activities of the two proteins in vivo .
The discrepancy probably reflects the rather significant differences in the assay systems used .
One possible explanation is that , as we discuss below , the two proteins could respond differentially to an intracellular signal expressed at different levels in F9 and BALB/c 3T3 cells ; for example F9 cells could contain high levels of a CREB-B-specific protein kinase absent from fibroblasts .
Another potential explanation stems from the relative concentrations of endogenous and exogenous CREB proteins in the transfected cells .
If the concentration of exogenous CREB is low , it may form dimers predominantly with endogenous proteins , distorting measurement of the activity intrinsic to the protein encoded by the transfected cDNA .
Our GAL4-CREB fusion proteins , like intact CREB , could also act in part by recruiting endogenous CREB via their free leucine zippers .
However , mutation of the serine residue phosphorylated by PKA substantially reduces the activity of the GAL4-CREB proteins in vivo ( L.A.B .
, unpublished Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 87 ( 1990 ) data ) , so most of the activity we are measuring must be intrinsic to the introduced proteins .
What is the functional significance of the two forms of CREB ?
Sequences related to the CRE are implicated in response to other stimuli , including phorbol esters , calcium , and viral trans-activators ( see , for example , refs .
20 , 22-24 ) .
In the case of calcium , a direct role for CREB has been proposed ( 24 ) .
Furthermore , cAMP has often been reported to synergize with or antagonize other agents ( see , for example , refs .
22 and 25 ) .
Thus , the 14-amino acid peptide found in CREB-B could mediate response to other stimuli .
The presence in this peptide of three serines and a threonine raises the possibility that this region is a target for cellular protein kinases .
Phosphorylation of CREB-B at distinct sites by different protein kinases could form the basis for synergistic activation with cAMP or could provide a site through which stimulation by PKA phosphorylation is counteracted by other signals .
Thus , CREB proteins could serve as a molecular focus for `` crosstalk `` often observed among signal transduction pathways , integrating signaling information at the level of gene transcription .
