Box 419100 , San Francisco , CA 94141-9100 ; and Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Vanderbilt University , 802 Light Hall , Nashville , TN 37232-0295 Communicated by Ira Herskowitz , August 26 , 1993 ( received for review May 28 , 1993 ) ABSTRACT RelA ( p65 ) functions as the critical trans-activating component of the heterodimeric pS50O-p65 NF-xB complex and contains a high-affinity binding site for its cytoplasmic inhibitor , IxBa .
After cellular activation , IxBa is rapidly degraded in concert with the induced nuclear translocation of NF-xB .
The present study demonstrates that tumor necrosis factor -induced degradation of IxBa in human T cells is preceded by its rapid phosphorylation in vivo .
However , these effects on IxcBax result in nuclear mobilization of only a fraction of the entire cytoplasmic pool of RelA .
Subsequent studies have revealed that ( i ) cytoplasmic RelA is stably associated not only with IxBa but also with other ankyrin motif-rich proteins including the products of the NF-xB2 ( p100 ) and NF-xB1 ( p105 ) genes ; ( i ? )
in contrast to RelA-IxBa , RelA , p100 cytoplasmic complexes are not dissociated following tumor necrosis factor a activation ; ( i ) p100 functions as a potent inhibitor of RelA-mediated transcription in vivo ; ( iv ) the interaction of RelA and p100 involves the conserved Rel homology domain of both proteins but not the nuclear localization signal of RelA , which is required for IxBa binding ; ( v ) p100 inhibition of RelA function requires the C-terminal ankyrin motif domain , which mediates cytoplasmic retention of RelA ; and ( vi ) as observed with IxBa , nuclear RelA stimulates p100 mRNA and protein expression .
These findings thus reveal the presence of a second inducible autoregulated inhibitory pathway that helps ensure the rapid but transient action of nuclear NF-KB .
The mammalian transcription factor NF- « B participates in the regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and multiple cellular genes that contain functional « B enhancer elements ( 1 , 2 ) .
NF-KB is an inducible heterodimeric complex composed of 50-kDa ( p50 ) and 65-kDa ( p65 , now designated RelA ) subunits ( 3-11 ) , both of which share an region of N-terminal homology with the v-Rel oncoprotein ( 12 , 13 ) and other members of the Rel transcription factor family ( 14 ) .
The RelA subunit of NF- « B contains a strong transcriptional activation domain and an intrinsic nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) that is recognized and masked by IxBa ( previously termed MAD-3 ) ( 15 , 16 ) , a cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF- « B that contains multiple ankyrin or SW16-cdc10 motifs ( 17 ) .
Cellular activation appears to lead to the phosphorylation of IxBa followed by the rapid dissociation and degradation of this cytoplasmic inhibitor , concomitant with nuclear translocation of the liberated NF- « B complex ( 18-20 ) .
In turn , nuclear NF- « B stimulates the transcription of an array of genes involved in such diverse functions as immune activation , inflammation , and development ( 1 , 2 , 14 ) .
During this induced genetic program , NF- « B also activates expression of the IxBa gene , thus facilitating an autoregulatory feedback mechanism that serves to temporally restrict NF- « B action ( 18 , 19 ) .

1346 Recent reports have revealed that RelA can also associate with yet other ankyrin motif-rich cytoplasmic proteins distinct from IxBa , including the NF- « B1 ( p105 ) and NF- « B2 ( p100 ) precursor gene products , which are subsequently cleaved to produce the p50 and p52 Rel family members , respectively ( 21-23 ) .
However , the functional significance of these interactions in vivo remains unclear .
In the present study , we have explored inducible phosphorylation of IxBa in human T cells and the structural basis and functional consequences of RelA interaction with the ankyrin motif-rich p100 and p105 Rel-containing precursors .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Transient Transfection Assays .
All cDNAs were subcloned into the pCMV4 expression vector ( 24 ) .
N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of RelA and p100 were generated by the polymerase chain reaction from the corresponding full-length cDNAs ( 16 ) .
The reporter plasmid « B-TATA-CAT contained the HIV-1 « B enhancer linked upstream of the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyitransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene ( 25 ) .
Human Jurkat T cells were maintained and transfected with effector and reporter plasmids using DEAE-dextran ( 26 ) and assayed for CAT activity as described ( 16 ) .
Immunoprecipitation , Immunoblotting , and Immunofluorescence Studies .
COS cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran ( 26 ) .
After 48 hr , recipient cells were starved for 1 hr in methionine/cysteine-deficient medium and metabolically radiolabeled for 2 hr with [ **S ) methionine and [ **S } cysteine as described ( 16 ) .
Whole-cell extracts were prepared by lysis in a low-stringency buffer and subjected to immunoprecipi-tation analyses with the indicated NF- « B- and IxB-specific antisera ( 16 ) .
Unlabeled subcellular protein extracts were prepared from Jurkat T cells or transfected COS cells as described ( 27 ) .
For phosphorylation analysis , the cell lysis buffer ( 27 ) was supplemented with 0.4 % Nonidet P-40 , 10 mM NaF , 0.1 mM NaVO , , 2 mM EDTA , 50 uM ZnCl » , and 10 uM sodium molybdate .
Protein samples ( 20 ug per lane for Jurkat and 4 pg per lane for COS ) were fractionated by SDS/PAGE and analyzed for immunoreactivity with various anti-peptide antisera using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( ECL ; Amersham ) .
For immunofluorescence studies , COS cells were grown on four-well chamber slides ( Nunc , Naperville , IL ) and then transfected using DEAE-dextran .
After 48 hr , the cells were fixed , permeabilized , and sequentially incubated with rabbit anti-RelA ( C terminus specific ) or anti-p100 followed by donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin covalently coupled to Texas Red dye ( 16 ) .

RESULTS Tumor Necrosis Factor a ( TNF-a ) -Induced Degradation of IxBa Is Preceded by IxBa Phosphorylation in Vivo .
Prior studies have shown that nuclear NF- « B binding activity is detectable within 10 min after TNF-a stimulation of human Jurkat T cells ( 18 , 19 ) .
In parallel , the cytoplasmic stores of IxBa are completely depleted between 10 and 40 min after TNF-a addition .
To investigate whether IxBa was phosphorylated in vivo prior to its degradation and the nuclear import of NF-KB , cytoplasmic extracts from T cells stimulated with TNF-a for 0-10 min were immunoblotted with anti-I « Ba specific antibodies ( Fig .
14 ) .
TNF-a stimulation led to the appearance of a low-mobility isoform of IxBa detected within 5 min after induction ( lane 3 ) .
Coincubation of these TNF-a-stimulated cells with okadaic acid , a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A ( 28 ) and an inducer of NF- « B ( 29 ) , temporally accelerated the appearance of this low-mobility IxBa isoform ( lanes 6 and 7 ) , perhaps reflecting the unopposed action of an as yet unidentified kinase .
Under both conditions of stimulation , this low-mobility IxBa isoform disappeared within 10 min , whereas the basally expressed IxBa isoform persisted ( lanes 4 and 8 ) .
Incubation of extracts from T cells stimulated with TNF-a for 5 min with Proc .
Natl .
Acad .

USA 91 ( 1994 ) 1347 calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase revealed the selective loss of this transiently expressed IxBa species , suggesting that its altered mobility reflected phosphorylation at one or more sites .
RelA Is Associated with Multiple Cytoplasmic Proteins , Including p100 and p105 .
Even after the intracellular stores of IxBa were completely degraded in response to TNF-a stimulation ( Fig .
1B , lane 3 ) , substantial amounts of RelA remained sequestered in the cytoplasm of these induced T lymphocytes ( Fig .
18 , lanes 3 and 5 ) .
These findings raised the possibility that RelA might be regulated by additional inhibitory molecules distinct from IxBa .
To examine this possibility , control preimmune ( Fig .
1C , lanes 1 , 4 , and 7 ) or anti-RelA ( lanes 2 , 5 , and 8 ) coimmunoprecipitates were prepared from Jurkat T cells , electrophoresed , and immunoblotted with peptide-specific antisera against the ankyrin motif-containing proteins p100 ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and p105 ( lanes 4 and 5 ) as well as IxBa ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
These studies revealed that , like IxBa , both p100 and p105 were readily coimmunoprecipitated with RelA ( Fig .
1C , lanes 2 , 5 , and 8 ) .
Further , deletion analysis showed that the physical interaction of p100 and p105 with RelA was mediated through their Rel homology domains .

( A ) Phosphorylation of IxBa in vivo in TNF-a-stimulated Jurkat T cells .
Cells ( 3 x 10° per ml ) were incubated for 1 hr in the presence ( lanes 5-8 ) or absence ( lanes 1-4 ) of okadaic acid ( OA ) at 50 ng/ml and then stimulated with TNF-a ( 140 units/ml ) for 0-10 min as indicated .
The slightly faster kinetics of IxBa degradation seen in this experiment versus ref .
19 likely reflects TNF stimulation of the cells at a lower cell density .
Cytoplasmic extracts prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors were fractionated on an SDS/10 % PAGE gel and then subjected to immunoblotting analyses with an antiserum specific for the C terminus of IxBa .
For phosphatase treatment , the extract from lane 3 was incubated at 37°C for 15 min either in phosphatase buffer alone ( lane 9 ) or in buffer containing 24 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase ( CIP ; lane 10 ) before analysis by SDS/PAGE .
( B ) Subcellular pattern of expression of RelA and IxBa in human Jurkat T cells stimulated with TNF-a ( 140 units/ml ) in the presence of cycloheximide ( CHX ; 25 ug/ml ) .
Cytoplasmic ( C ) and nuclear ( N ) extracts ( 20 ug ) , prepared at the indicated times after TNF-a addition , were fractionated on a SDS/8.75 % PAGE , and subjected to immunoblotting analyses with a mixture of IxBa- and RelA-specific antisera .
( C ) Physical association of NF- « B RelA with p100 , p105 , and IxBa in the cytoplasm of unstimulated Jurkat T cells .
Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from unstimulated Jurkat T cells and incubated with either preimmune serum or RelA-specific antiserum .
The immunoprecipitates were then divided into three aliquots , subjected to SDS/PAGE , and immunoblotted with peptide-specific antisera recognizing the N terminus ( amino acids 1-21 ) of p100 ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , the N terminus ( amino acids 1-21 ) of p105 ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , or the C terminus ( amino acids 289-317 ) of IxBa ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Control lanes ( 3 , 6 , and 9 ) contained extracts from COS cells transfected with cDNA expression vectors encoding p100 , p105 , and IxBa , respectively .
( D ) Distinct dynamics for RelA-IxBa and RelA-p100 complex disassembly in TNF-a-stimulated Jurkat T cells .
Cells were stimulated with TNF-a ( 140 units/ml ) for the indicated times followed by the preparation of cytoplasmic extracts .
These extracts ( 400 ug ) were immunoprecipitated with antiserum specific for either the C terminus of IxBa ( lanes 1-3 ) or the N terminus of p100 ( lanes 4-6 ) and analyzed on SDS/8.75 % PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the antiserum specific for the C terminus of RelA .

interaction , which critically involves inhibitor masking of the NLS present within the Rel homology domain of RelA ( 15 , 16 ) , the interactions of p100 and p105 with RelA persisted despite deletion of the NLS of RelA ( data not shown ) .
RelA-IxBa and RelA-p100 Cytoplasmic Complexes Are Differentially Regulated After TNF-a Stimulation .
To further compare and contrast the biological actions of IxBa and p100 , we examined the dynamics of RelA-IxBa and RelA , p100 complex disassembly in T cells stimulated with TNF-a ( Fig .
1D ) .
IxBa , p100 , and associated proteins were first immunoprecipitated with specific antisera against either IxBa ( lanes 1-3 ) or p100 ( lanes 4-6 ) and then analyzed for the presence of coimmunoprecipitated RelA by immunoblotting with RelA-specific antiserum .
As predicted from the degra-dative fate of IxBa ( Fig .
1B ) , detection of RelA was lost 30 min after TNF-a addition ( lane 2 ) , but this immunoreactive species reappeared at 2 hr ( lane 3 ) , reflecting the de novo synthesis of IxBa ( 18 , 19 ) .
This dynamic change in IxBa expression precisely correlates with the transient nuclear translocation of RelA ( 19 ) .
In contrast , the association of RelA and p100 was not significantly altered even after 2 hr of TNF-a stimulation ( lanes 4-6 ) .
p100 Exhibits Potent IxB-Like Activity in Vivo .
To determine whether the interaction of RelA with p100 and p105 was functionally significant in vivo , Jurkat T cells were transfected with an HIV « B-CAT reporter plasmid together with expression vectors encoding RelA , IxBa , p100 , and p105 , either alone or in various combinations ( Fig .
24 ) .
Whereas RelA potently activated « B-directed transcription from the HIV « B-CAT reporter ( > 250-fold ) , coexpression of RelA with either p100 or IxBa significantly inhibited activation .
Only modest inhibitory effects were obtained after cotransfection of p105 .
Deletion of the ankyrin motif-rich domain of p100 [ p100 ( 1-455 ) ] , or coexpression of RelA with the equivalent of the posttranslationally cleaved form of p100 ( p52 ) , which also lacks the ankyrin motif-rich domain , resulted in the near complete loss of these inhibitory effects ( Fig .
2B ) .
p100 Inhibition of RelA Function Is Correlated with Cytoplasmic Retention of RelA .
To examine whether p100 regulated RelA activity by altering its subcellular distribution , indirect immunofluorescence studies were performed in transfected COS cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Since wild-type RelA can induce endogenous IxBa expression leading to cytoplasmic trapping of RelA ( 19 ) , an N-terminal truncation mutant of RelA [ p65 ( 41-551 ) ] that lacks DNA binding activity ( 16 ) but retains the capacity to bind to p100 and IxBa ( data not shown ) was used .
Expression of the p65 ( 41-551 ) mutant alone revealed a predominantly nuclear pattern of fluorescence ( Fig .
300 Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 91 ( 1994 ) 3a ) while coexpression of this truncated form of RelA with IxBa yielded a nuclear-excluded pattern ( Fig .
3b ) .
Similarly , coexpression of this RelA mutant with p100 produced a cytoplasmic pattern of RelA expression ( Fig .
3¢c ) .
However , consistent with their inability to inhibit RelA function in vivo , neither a truncated form of p100 ( 1-455 ) nor p52 reproduced this cytoplasmic retention pattern of RelA expression ( Fig .
3 d and e ) .
Expression of p100 and NF-xB2 mRNA Are Induced by RelA .
Recent studies have shown that NF- « B is capable of regulating the expression of one of its own inhibitors , IxBa ( 18 , 19 ) .
Since p100 is also an immediate-early activation gene product ( 30 ) and is involved in the cytoplasmic retention and functional inhibition of RelA ( refs .
21 and 22 ; Figs .
2 and 3 ) , immunoblotting studies were next performed to investigate whether p100 protein expression is also regulated by RelA ( Fig .
4 ) .
COS cells were transfected with the control parental pCMV4 vector or vectors encoding various Rel proteins including p50 , RelA , and c-Rel .
As shown in Fig .
4 , virtually no p100 protein was detected in extracts from cells transfected with pCMV4 ( lane 1 ) , p50 ( lane 2 ) , or c-Rel ( lane 3 ) .
However , transfection of RelA markedly induced the expression of p100 protein ( lane 4 ) .
Of note , this induction of p100 by RelA could be significantly inhibited by cotransfection of IxBa ( lane 5 ) .
In contrast to wild-type RelA , deletion mutants of RelA lacking either the DNA-binding [ p65 ( 41-551 ) ] or the transactivation [ p65 ( 1-312 ) ] domains failed to induce p100 protein expression ( lanes 8 and 9 ) .
These findings of RelA induction of p100 at the protein level were entirely recapitulated at the level of NF- « B2 mRNA expression as measured in RNase protection studies ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION In this report , we demonstrate an IxBa-independent mechanism of NF-KB regulation in vivo involving the NF- « B2 gene product , p100 .
In agreement with two recent studies ( 21 , 22 ) , we have found that RelA is physically associated with both p100 and p105 as well as IxBa in the cytoplasm of unstimulated human T cells .
We further show that p100 , like IkBa , potently inhibits the transcriptional activity of RelA .
However , under the same conditions , p105 produces curiously less inhibition .
At present , the molecular basis for these differences in p100- and p105-mediated inhibition of RelA action remains unknown .
However , this finding may have important implications for the multiple intracellular mechanisms that are responsible for regulating the potent transcriptional activity of RelA .

- Inhibition of NF- « B RelA-mediated transcriptional activation by p100 in vivo .
( A ) Human Jurkat T cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors alone ( 2 ug ) or in combination ( 2 ug of each ) together with a CAT reporter plasmid containing the HIV-1 « B enhancer ( « B-TATA-CAT ) .
( B ) RelA was cotransfected with various truncated forms of p100 including p100 ( 1-455 ) , which contains the N-terminal 455 amino acids and lacks the C-terminal ankyrin motif repeat domain , and p52 , which encodes a 447-amino-acid-long peptide that approximates the physiologically cleaved form of p100 .
CAT activities were measured 48 hr after transfection and are presented as fold induction relative to the basal level of enzymatic activity obtained with the parental pCMV4 expression vector .

- p100 inhibits nuclear expression of RelA .
COS cells were transfected with a N-terminal truncation mutant of RelA , p65 ( 41-551 ) , alone ( a ) or with I « Ba ( b ) , p100 ( c ) , p100 ( 1-455 ) ( d ) , or p52 ( e ) or , as an antibody specificity control , with p100 alone ( f ) .
Forty-eight hours after transfection , the cells were fixed , incubated with the antiserum against the C terminus of RelA , and then subjected to indirect immunofluorescence staining using Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG ( Amersham ) .
Although both IxBa and p100 function as important cytoplasmic inhibitors of RelA , several fundamental differences exist regarding their mechanism of action and regulation .
Our present studies coupled with a recent report ( 20 ) have shown that a fraction of IxBa is rapidly phosphorylated in vivo after cellular activation with TNF-a .
This phosphorylation event appears to lead to enhanced degradation of the IxBa .
However , it remains unclear whether the dissociation of IxBa from NF- « B forms an intermediate step between phosphorylation and degradation or whether degradation can occur in the absence of release , or even perhaps phosphorylation , given the incompleteness of the latter modification .
In contrast to TNF-a-induced release of « Ba from NF- « B , this cytokine does not promote the dissociation of p100 from RelA .
These findings suggest that the cytoplasmic p100-RelA complex is subject to an alternate form of regulation .
Since p52 , the processed form of p100 , continues to associate with p65 , we hypothesize that one mechanism for activation of the p100-RelA complex may involve physiological processing of p100 to p52 .
This processing results in removal of the C-terminal ankyrin motifs that are essential for p100 inhibition of RelA function but not its assembly with RelA .

- NF- « B induces the expression of endogenous p100 protein .
The effects of various Rel-related proteins on p100 protein expression are shown .
COS cells were transfected with either the parental pCMV4 vector ( lanes 1 and 6 ) or the expression vectors encoding the indicated Rel-related polypeptides .
Whole-cell extracts were prepared 48 hr after transfection and subjected to SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting analysis with peptide-specific antiserum recognizing the N terminus of human p100 .
The p100 polypeptide and its processed form , p52 , are indicated .
case of IxBa , its ankyrin motifs are needed both for functional inhibition and for physical assembly with RelA ( 17 , 32 ) .
The ankyrin repeat motifs present in both IxBa and p100 likely mediate protein-protein interactions that serve to sequester RelA in the cytoplasmic compartment .
The regulated partitioning of factors between the cytoplasm and nucleus by such ankyrin motif-containing inhibitors has emerged as a hallmark of the Rel family of transcription factors .
Finally , the interaction of IxBa with RelA involves the binding of this inhibitor to the NLS of RelA .
Deletion of the NLS in RelA results in sharply diminished IxBa binding and IxBa-mediated function ( 15 , 16 ) .
In contrast , NLS deletion in RelA has no effect on its interaction with p100 ( data not shown ) .
Rather , distinct sequences within the Rel homology domain of both RelA and p100 , likely those responsible for dimerization with other Rel family members , mediate this specific factor-inhibitor interaction .
Of note , our current studies indicate that RelA autoregu-lates the expression of not only IxBa ( 19 ) but also p100 .
Specifically , transfection of RelA induces increased expression of NF- « B2 mRNA and the corresponding p100 protein .
The NF- « B1 gene also appears to be similarly regulated ( 31 ) , and the p105 precursor product of this gene also antagonizes RelA function ( 21 , 22 ) , albeit weakly in our studies compared to p100 .
These findings thus highlight a redundant system of inducible ankyrin-rich cytoplasmic inhibitors that provides for yet additional plasticity in the regulation of NF- « B induction occurring in response to various immune , inflam-matory , or developmental stimuli .
