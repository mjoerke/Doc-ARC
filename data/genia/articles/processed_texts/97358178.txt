The inability of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to suppress its synthesis in macrophages contrasts with the tight control of its production in macrophage precursors , peripheral blood monocytes ( PBM ) .
We examined whether 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; resistance develops as PBM differentiate to macrophages or with macrophage activation .
Normal human pulmonary alveolar macrophages ( PAM ) are less sensitive to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; than PBM , despite similar vitamin D receptor content ; however , both PBM and PAM respond to exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , by inhibiting 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , synthesis and inducing 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , degradation through enhancement of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels and activity .
The human monocytic cell line THP-1 mimics PAM in 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; synthesis and sensitivity to exogenous 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; .
We utilized THP-1 cells to examine the response to 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; , with macrophage activation .
Activation of THP-1 cells with y-interferon ( y-IFN ) enhances 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; synthesis 30-fold , blocks 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; , suppression of its synthesis , and reduces by 42.2 % 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; induction of its degradation .
The antagonistic effects of y-IFN are not merely restricted to enzymatic activities .
In THP-1 cells and in normal PBM , y-IFN inhibits 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels without reducing mRNA stability , suggesting y-IFN inhibition of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; transactivating function .
These results explain 1,25 ( OH ) , D , overproduction in granulomatoses and demonstrate potent inhibition by y-IFN of 1,25 ( O0H ) ; D ; action in immune cells .
( J Clin Endocrinol Metab 82 : 2222-2232 , 1997 ) HE HYPERCALCEMIA associated with sarcoidosis , tuberculosis , various granulomatoses and rheumatoid arthritis is caused by endogenous overproduction of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [ 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; ] ( 1 ) , the most active metabolite of vitamin D ( 2 ) , by the disease activated macrophage .
Under normal physiological circumstances , 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; is synthesized almost exclusively in the kidney .
The renal 1a-hydroxylation of 25 ( OH ) D ; is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450-linked mixed function oxidase located in the mitochon-dria of the proximal tubules ( 3 ) .
Renal 1 « -hydroxylase activity is under stringent regulation by serum levels of para-thyroid hormone , calcium , phosphorus and 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; 3 itself ( 3 ) , so that serum 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; levels remain within the normal range even in cases of vitamin D intoxication in which circulating 250HD ; levels increase 70-fold above normal ( 4 ) .
In contrast , in sarcoidosis and tuberculosis , macrophage 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; synthesis correlates with 250HD ; levels ( 5 ) and the degree of the inflammatory response in the host ( 6 ) , and 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; overproduction occurs despite severe hypercalcemia , suppressed PTH levels , and supranormal Received October 28 , 1996 .

concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; , ( 7-9 ) .
These observations suggested that nonrenal 1 « -hydroxylases do not respond to the modulators of the renal enzyme .
In fact , studies in vitro using sarcoid ( 6 , 10 ) or cytokine activated macrophages ( 11 ) demonstrated that the 1a-hydroxylation reaction is relatively immune to stimulation by calcium , PTH , or to feedback inhibition by 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; .
The resistance of activated macrophages to 1,25 ( OH ) , D , ; , inhibition of its own production contrasts markedly with the high sensitivity to 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; of peripheral monocytes , the precursors of tissue macrophages .
Similar to the renal enzyme , monocyte 1la-hydroxylase activity is profoundly suppressed by physiological concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in vitro ( 12 ) , and in vivo as demonstrated in peripheral monocytes from hemo-dialysis patients undergoing 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; replacement therapy ( 13 ) .
In order to characterize the cause of this discrep-ancy , we examined the mechanisms involved in 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; control of its synthesis in normal monocytes , and whether the response to the sterol in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage decreases as monocytes differentiate to tissue macrophages or as a result of macrophage activation .
An alternative mechanism for 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; to control its net production , and therefore its plasma levels in humans , is to increase its metabolic clearance rate ( 14 ) through the enhancement of 24-hydroxylase activity , the enzyme responsible for 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , inactivation in mammals ( 2 , 3 ) .
1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , degradation occurs mainly in kidney and intestine ( 15-17 ) , where the sterol induces the expression of 24-hydroxylase through a typical steroid-like mechanism 2222 Downloaded from jcem.endojournals.org on August 11 , 2005 y-INTERFERON INHIBITION OF VITAMIN D ACTION ( 18 , 19 ) .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; binds its intracellular vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , and the 1,25 ( OH ) , D , -V DR complex interacts with additional nuclear transcription factors , and with specific vitamin D responsive elements in the promoter region of the 24-hydroxylase gene enhancing the rate of transcription ( 20 ) .
A discrepancy similar to that described for 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; control of its synthesis also exists between normal PBM and disease activated macrophages in 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -induction of its degradation .
Early studies utilizing sarcoid PAM ( 10 , 11 ) or cytokine activated PAM ( 21 ) , before the cloning of the human 24-hydroxylase , did not demonstrate induction of 24-hydroxylase activity even in response to concentrations of exogenous 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; 400 times above normal ( 10 ) .
Inter-estingly , VDR content was not reduced in activated macrophages ( 22 ) .
In contrast , in normal monocytes , physiological concentrations of 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; induce 250HD ; ( 12 , 23 ) and 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; degradation ( 24 ) .
The actual contribution of the C24-oxidation pathway in both processes in monocytes , however , has not been evaluated .
It is possible that 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; induction of its degradation in human monocyte-macrophages does not involve C24-hydroxylation .
Alterna-tively , 1,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated transcriptional activation of the 24-hydroxylase gene may be impaired along monocytic differentiation to macrophages or as a direct result of macrophage activation .
To identify the mechanisms mediating 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; resis-tance , first , we assessed the involvement of rapid ( non-genomic ) and/or steroid-like ( genomic ) mechanisms in 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; control of its production in PBM .
Next , we examined the role of differentiation by comparing the response to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in the inhibition of its synthesis as well as in the induction of catabolism between resting peripheral monocytes and pulmonary alveolar macrophages from normal adults .
We present evidence that the human monocytic cell line THP-1 constitutes a proper model of tissue macrophage .
Finally , we examined the effects of activation of normal monocytes and THP-1 cells with the cytokine y-IFN on 1,25 ( OH ) , D , modulation of the activity of 1 « - and 24- hy-droxylases , and in 1,25 ( OH ) , D , -mediated induction of 24-hydroxylase gene transcription .
We demonstrate the existence of potent antagonistic effects of y-IFN not only on 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; control of the activities of 1 « - and 24-hydroxylases , but on 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; -induc-tion of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels .
The latter is not the result of a decreased half life of 24-hydroxylase mRNA , suggesting that y-IFEN impairs 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; transactivating function in normal monocytes and in THP-1 cells leading to vitamin D resistance .

1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; synthesis was measured in triplicate for every substrate concentration ; Km and Vmax were obtained from a linear regression analysis of the data using the double reciprocal plot of Lineweaver-Burk .
To assess whether the 1a-hydroxylation of 250HD ; in dTHP-1 cells was mediated by a cytochrome P450-linked mixed function oxidase , or by nonenzymatic oxidation of 250HD ; by free radicals ( generated through the activation of macrophages by y-IFN ) , dTHP-1 cells were incubated with 0 or 2000 IU/mL y-IFN for 18 h as indicated for Km and Vmax determinations .
Cells were then washed , and the incubation medium was replaced by 0.1 % BSA- RPMI 1640 containing 10 umol/L ketoconazole , a cytochrome P450 inhibitor , or the free radical scavengers N , N'-diphenylethylenediamine ( 10 mol/L ) or ethylendiaminetetrace-tic acid ( 3 mmol/L ) .
For each experimental condition , 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; synthesis was measured in triplicate .
We assessed the identity of the putative 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; , generated by THP-1 cells as follows : Nonadherent THP-1 cells were plated in eight tissue culture dishes ( 60 X 15 mmol/L ) , at a concentration of 6 X 10° cells in 3 ml 10 % FBS RPMI 1640 containing 160 nmol/L TPA , and incubated at 37 C for 24 h.

Results Mechanisms mediating 1,25 ( OH ) ; D , ; regulation of vitamin D metabolism in normal peripheral blood monocytes .
Because the resistance of activated macrophages to 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -inhibition of its own synthesis is unrelated to changes in VDR content , we first examined whether the tight control by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; of its own synthesis in normal monocytes involved rapid , nongenomic mechanisms instead of the most common steroid-like action mediated by the VDR .

Both effects of the sterol , the suppression of 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; synthesis and the induction of catabolic pathways , measured by the rate of synthesis of polar metabolites , were only evident after 2 h.

We therefore focused on characterizing whether 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; induction of its own catabolism in monocytes involved a genomic mechanism .
Specifically , we examined the C24-hydroxylation pathway , the major catabolic pathway induced by 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; through a classical steroid-like mechanism in kidney and intestine in mammals ( 18 , 19 ) .

sis of polar metabolites depicted in Fig .

To further confirm this correlation , we examined whether the polar metabolites were 24-hydroxylated by using the classical periodate cleavage reaction ( 30 ) and HPLC elution profiles .
Polar metabolites synthesized from tritiated 250HD ; by untreated cells ( controls ) or by monocytes exposed to 0.24 nmol/L 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; for 18 h were subjected to 8 % NaIO , for 30 min at 0-4 C and further HPLC-purified as described in Materials and Methods .
NaIO , cleaves the side chain of cholecalciferols between adjacent hydroxyl groups , and because the °H-250HD ; used as substrate in these experiments was labeled at €26 and C27 , both C24 or C26 hydroxylations would result in loss of radioactivity after periodate treatment .
25-26 di-hydroxylated compounds , however , would only lose half of the tritium .
Control experiments using tritiated 250HD ; and 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; showed no degradation of these metabolites by NaIQO , .
In addition , NaIQO , treatment had no effect on the 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D , ; , produced by the cells , confirming its specificity of action for vitamin D metabolites containing diols .
In three independent experiments , NaIO , treatment resulted in a total loss of radioactivity eluting with the polar metabolite fraction in 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; -treated monocytes .
The simultaneous detection by HPLC of tritiated metabolites coeluting with 1,24,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and 1,25 ( OH ) , -24-o0xo-vitamin D standards in monocytes treated with 0.24 nmol/L 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; for 4 h , but not in untreated monocytes , suggested that induction of the 24-hydroxylation pathway in normal human PBM might partially account for the increase in polar metabolite synthesis by 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; .
Furthermore , 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; induction of vitamin D catabolism ( synthesis of DUSSO ET AL .
JCE & M » 1997 Vol 82 « No 7 polar metabolites ) required ongoing protein synthesis .
Incubation of monocytes with 0.1 ug/ml cycloheximide for 4 h did not affect monocyte viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion .
However , we found that the 5.7-fold induction of the synthesis of polar metabolites by 0.24 nmol/L 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; over that of untreated monocytes was totally abolished ( P < 0.001 ) in monocytes exposed to the same concentration of the sterol in the presence of cycloheximide .
These results demonstrate that , in normal monocytes , 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; inhibition of its synthesis does not involve rapid mechanisms and that , similar to kidney and intestine , 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; induces its degradation through enhancement of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels and activity .
Vitamin D metabolism and its regulation by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in normal pulmonary alveolar macrophages To assess whether the ability of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to control its own synthesis and catabolism is lost as peripheral monocytes differentiate to tissue macrophages , we examined 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , production and its regulation by exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; in PAM obtained from healthy adult volunteers by bronchial lavage .
Normal human PAM constitutively express 1a-hydroxylase activity .
They convert 250HD ; ( S.A. : 27.7 Ci/mmol ; 0.1 uCi ) to 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; at a rate of 5.2 + 1.4 fmol / ug DNA /h ( n = 4 ) , similar to that of PBM .
Fig .
3 shows a dose response to exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in the control of its synthesis ( left panel ) and the induction of catabolism ( right panel ) in normal PAM .
The left panel depicts that a 0.24 nmol/L dose of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; was ineffective in suppressing 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D , ; , production .
A 4.8 nmol/L concentration of the sterol was required to reduce 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; , synthesis by 48.0 + 3.9 % of control ( untreated PAM ) .
Similarly , the right panel shows that a 0.24 nmol/L dose of 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; did not induce the synthesis of polar metabolites .
Even with concentrations of exogenous 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; that is 20-100 times higher than physiological ( from 4.8-24.0 nmol/L ) , the induction of catabolic pathways was only 1.5-fold above control ( 2.1 + 1.7 fmol / pg DNA /h ) and did not reach statistical significance .
Table 1 shows 24-hydroxylase : GAPDH mRNA levels in 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -treated PAM .
Similar to the induction of activity of enzymes involved in catabolic pathways , an exogenous 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; concentration of 4.8 nmol/L and 18-h exposure to the sterol were required for PAM to increase 24-hydroxylase mRNA to detectable levels .
The lower sensitivity to 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , of PAM was not caused by a decrease in VDR , as we found no difference in maximal specific binding of tritiated 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; to the VDR between PBM and PAM ( PBM : 0.65 + 0.1 fmol / ug DNA , n = 5 ; vs. PAM : 0.67 + 0.17 , n = 3 ) .

resting and y-IFN activated THP-1 cells was totally blocked by 10 umol/L ketoconazole , a cytochrome P450 inhibitor ( Table 3 ) .
Basal and y-IFN stimulated 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; production by THP-1 were not affected by the presence of the free radical scavengers EDTA ( 3 mmol/L ) , or by N , N'-diphenylethylenediamine ( 10 /L ) , demonstrating that conversion of 250HD ; to 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; is the result of enzymatic oxidation of 250HD ; involving a cytochrome P45Q0-linked hydroxylation .
We demonstrated that the metabolite synthesized by dTHP-1 cells under basal or yIFN induced states is 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , by the following criteria : 1 ) coelution with 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; standards in two straight phase and one reverse phase HPLC purifications : 1,25 ( OH ) , D , ; , production by y-IFN treated THP-1 cells was high enough to allow the detection at a wavelength of 265 nm of a peak with the retention time of authentic 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; in the chromatograms from the three HPLC systems ; 2 ) the ability of the endogenously produced 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; to induce 24-hydroxylase activity : 60 and 287 fmoles of 24,25 ( OH ) , D ; , were generated in 4 and 6 h , respectively , by resting THP-1 cells incubated with 12 nmol/L °H-250HD ; alone .
In y-IEN treated cells , there was no detectable 24,25 ( OH ) , D ; despite endogenous 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; levels 5.6-fold above those of resting THP-1 cells ; and 3 ) the affinity of the HPLC purified putative 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; , for the VDR : comparison of the displacement of °H-1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , from the calf thymus receptor by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; standards and different dilutions of the HPLC-purified putative 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; synthesized in 4 h rendered actual concentrations of putative 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; of 3.7 and 3.1 ng in control cells and 18.3 ng in y-IFN treated THP-1 cells .
Downloaded from jcem.endojournals.org on August 11 , 2005 2228 These values did not differ from the expected concentrations of 3.9 , 2.2 , and 15.3 ng estimated from the rate of conversion of °H-250HD ; to °H-1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; using one single HPLC purification after correction for recoveries .
We next examined whether dTHP-1 cells respond to exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; like PBM or PAM .
Similar to PAM , THP-1 cells did not respond to 0.24 nmol/L 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; 3 even after an 18-h exposure .
They required 4.8 nmol/L 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to suppress 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; synthesis by 67.3 % ( P < 0.05 ) and to induce vitamin D catabolism 2.3-fold over controls ( P < 0.05 ) in 4 h. Figure 4 shows that 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; 3 induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels also required a concentration of 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; 10 times higher than that effective in PBM .
The lower sensitivity of THP-1 cells is unrelated to a reduced VDR content as the maximal specific binding of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to the VDR in THP-1 cells was 0.60 + 0.05 fmol of 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; /ug DNA ; n = 4 , similar to that of PAM .

for 18 h. Figure 5 shows that y-IFN blocks the ability of 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA in THP-1 cells in a dose dependent manner .
Five IU/mL y-IFN decreased 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels by 50.1 % with maximal inhibition ( 86 % ) achieved with concentrations of the cytokine higher than 20 IU/mL .
We next measured VDR content of y-IFN -treated dTHP-1 .
In two independent experiments , maximal specific binding of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to the VDR was similar in controls ( 0.67 + 0.04 fmol 1 , 25 ( OH ) , D , / ug DNA ) and in THP-1 cells treated with 25 IU/mL of yIFN ( 0.59 + 0.02 fmol 1 , 25 ( OH ) , D ; / ug DNA ) , a dose that elicited maximal inhibition of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , -mediated increase in 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels .
Higher concentrations of the cytokine ( 100 and 2000 IU/mL ) reduced 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; binding to the VDR to 69.0 % + 7.1 and 69.2 % + 9.6 ( P < 0.05 ) of controls , respectively .
Thus , the decrease in 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -VDR binding with increasing y-IFN concentrations can not account for the dramatic loss of responsiveness .
To assess whether the observed inhibitory effects of y-INF on 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; actions were physiologically relevant or an artifact of the treatment with phorbol-ester to induce THP-1 cells to differentiate to a macrophage-like phenotype , we used peripheral blood monocytes from normal volunteers to examine the effects of 2000 U/mL y-INF on 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; suppression of la-hydroxylase activity , and on 1,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA .

A potential post-transcriptional mechanism for y-IFN to reduce 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels would be to decrease the stability of 24-hydroxylase mRNA .
To test this possibility , we measured the half life of 24-hydroxylase mRNA in untreated and y-IFN treated THP-1 cells .
Fig .

In two independent experiments , the estimated half life of 24-hydroxylase mRNA was 4.5 + 0.15 h in control cells and 4.9 + 1.3 h in y-IFN treated dTHP-1 cells .
Clearly , y-IFN does not reduce 24-hydroxylase mRNA stability , as better illustrated in Fig .

This suggests an antagonistic effect of the cytokine on 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; induction of 24-hydroxylase gene transcription .

Effect of y-IFN on the half life of 24-hydroxylase mRNA .
dTHP-1 cells were exposed to 9.6 nmol/L 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; and 0 or 20 U/mL y-IFN for 18 h. 5 ug of the RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D were then added to block further transcription .

The data represent the mean + SEM of triplicate determinations from one representative experiment .

The data represents mean + SEM of 24-hydroxylase/GAPDH mRNA levels expressed as percent from the ratio at time 0 after the addition of actinomycin D. hypercalcemia in various granulomatoses .
The demonstration that the VDR content does not change with macrophage activation ( 22 ) suggests that 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; inhibition of its own synthesis in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage may involve rapid , nongenomic mechanisms similar to the 1a-hydroxylase of kidney cell cultures ( 34 ) .
Time course experiments in normal PBM ruled out the involvement of rapid , nongenomic actions in 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; , control of monocytic 1a-hydroxylase .
1,25- ( OH ) , D ; , suppression of its own synthesis required at least a 2-h exposure to physiological concentrations of the sterol .
Even with concentrations of 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; ten times above the normal range , no feedback inhibition of monocyte 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; production was detected within the first hour .
Although conclusive evidence of a genomic control by the sterol of its own synthesis awaits the cloning of the 1a « -hydroxylase , the recent demonstration of enhanced 1 « -hydroxylase activity and high serum 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; levels in the VDR knockout mouse ( 35 ) supports our finding that 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; suppression of its own synthesis may be a VDR mediated process .
The striking difference in the sensitivity to 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; inhibition of la-hydroxylase activity between peripheral blood monocytes , the precursors of tissue macrophages , and activated macrophages raises the possibility that the cellular signaling pathways required by the sterol are lost either in the differentiation of peripheral monocytes to tissue macrophages or as a result of macrophage activation .
To evaluate the contribution of monocyte differentiation in macrophage-resistance to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , we examined 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; control of its synthesis in PAM obtained by bronchial lavage from healthy adult volunteers .
PAM constitutively express l-hydroxylase activity , and the rate of 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; production is similar to that of PBM .
However , a concentration of Downloaded from jcem.endojournals.org on August 11 , 2005 22830 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; , 20 times higher than that effective in PBM was required to reduce 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; synthesis by 50 % .
Thus , 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; is capable of suppressing its synthesis in normal PAM with a lower potency .
This contrasts markedly with the lack of feedback inhibition by the sterol of macrophage 1 « -hydroxylase of human PAM activated in vivo by underlying diseases such as sarcoidosis ( 7 ) , tuberculosis ( 8 ) , various granulomatoses ( 1 ) , and rheumatoid arthritis ( 9 ) , or in vitro after exposure of normal PAM to y-IFN ( 10 ) or TNFa ( 21 ) .
This led us to hypothesize cytokine-induced resistance to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in the control of its synthesis .
To test this hy-pothesis , we overcame difficulties in obtaining human macrophages by examining the human monocytic cell line THP-1 as a potential model of tissue macrophage .
THP-1 cells were chosen because of their ability to be induced to differentiate toward a macrophage-like state by exposure to phorbol esters ( 28 ) .
Phorbol-differentiated THP-1 cells mimic more closely monocyte derived macrophages in the expression of oncogenes and membrane proteins than their more widely used counterparts , HL-60 or U937 cells ( 36 ) .
We demonstrate that phorbol-differentiated THP-1 cells mimic normal PAM in the constitutive expression of 1 « -hydroxylase activity and in the 30 fold-increase in 1,25 ( OH ) , D , ; , production in response to y-IFN .
The metabolite synthesized by resting and y-IFN activated THP-1 cells is authentic 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; based on its chromatographic properties , the affinity for the calf thymus VDR , and the ability to induce 24-hydroxylase activity .
Basal and y-IFN induced 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; synthesis in THP-1 cells were totally blocked by the cytochrome P450 inhibitor ketoconazole , and unaffected by the free radical scavengers ethylenediamine tetracetic acid or diparaphenylenediamine .
This suggests that , similar to the renal ( 2 , 3 ) , PBM ( 12 ) , and sarcoid PAM 1la-hydroxylases ( 11 ) , the conversion of 250HD ; to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in THP-1 cells is an enzymatic cytochrome P450-linked hydroxylation .
The sensitivity of THP-1 cells to suppress 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; synthesis in response to exogenous 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is also similar to that of PAM and lower than that of PBM .
Thus , THP-1 cells provide a proper model of pulmonary alveolar macrophages .
The demonstration that a concentration of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , effective to suppress 1 « -hydroxylase activity in resting THP-1 cells , had no effect in the presence of y-IFN supports the existence of cytokine-induced resistance to 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; in the feedback inhibition of macrophage 1 « -hydroxylase .
Part of the decrease in 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; production by exogenous 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; , may result from the well known genomic action of 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; , the induction of its own degradation ( 15-19 ) .
In nearly all target tissues , 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; induces 24-hydroxylase , the key enzyme in mammalian vitamin D catabolism ( 15-17 ) .
Previous reports from our laboratory in normal monocytes have shown that physiological concentrations of exogenous 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; induce vitamin D catabolism ( 12 , 23 ) and 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; degradation ( 24 ) ; however , the contribution of the C24-hydroxylation pathway in both processes has not been evaluated .
The present studies demonstrate that 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; induction of vitamin D catabolism also requires a 2-h exposure to the sterol and ongoing protein synthesis , suggesting the involvement of a genomic mechanism .
The time course for 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels paralleled the in DUSSO ET AL .
JCE & M » 1997 Vol 82 « No 7 crease in synthesis of 24-hydroxylated polar metabolites , suggesting that , similar to kidney ( 15 , 16 ) and intestine ( 17 ) , in normal PBM 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; induces 250HD ; , catabolism and its own degradation through enhancement of 24-hydroxylase gene transcription .
In contrast , cytokine-activated macrophages exhibit no induction of 24-hydroxylase activity by either the excessive 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; levels endogenously generated ( 11 , 21 ) or in response to concentrations of exogenous 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; 400 times above the normal range ( 10 ) .
Perhaps , cytokines also impair the genomic actions of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , and we utilized 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; -induction of 24-hydroxylase gene transcription to further characterize the mechanisms involved .
Studies in PAM and THP-1 cells demonstrated that , similar to the response to the sterol in the control of its synthesis , a concentration of 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; , 20 times higher than that effective in normal PBM was required to induce the generation of polar metabolites and 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels .
The lower potency of 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D3 in both cell types was not attributable to a decrease in VDR content , as the maximal 1,25- ( OH ) , D , ; -VDR specific binding was similar to that observed in PBM .
A similar functional block of vitamin D-dependent gene regulation by 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; , has been described in human B lymphocytes ( 37 ) despite the expression of VDR mRNA and protein suggesting that factors other than VDR content determine the magnitude of the response to the sterol .
A role for the state of differentiation rather than VDR levels in the response to exogenous 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; has been reported for the modulation of the expression of the osteocalcin ( 38 ) and 24-hydroxylase genes ( 39 ) in rat osteoblasts , the calcium binding protein in cells of the crypt and the villus of the intestine ( 40 ) , and for the induction of 24-hydroxylase in HT-29 human colon cancer cells ( 41 ) and murine keratino-cytes ( 42 ) .
In our studies , the difference in 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels between peripheral monocytes and pulmonary alveolar macrophages supports the findings that the transcriptional and/or translational steps may be more sensitive in less differentiated cells than in more highly differentiated ( mature ) ones ( 38-42 ) .
We utilized phorbol-differentiated THP-1 cells to assess the effect of activation of human macrophages with the cytokine y-IFN , responsible for 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; overproduction by PAM in sarcoidosis and tuberculosis ( 32 , 33 ) , on the genomic response to 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; .
y-IFN markedly reduced 1,25- ( OH ) , D , -mediated induction of its own degradation .
The antagonistic effects of y-IFN were not limited to 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , regulation of the activity of 24-hydroxylase but extended to 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; , induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels .
In THP-1 cells , yIFN decreases the 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels in a concentration dependent manner with a 50 % reduction at a concentration of the cytokine as low as 5 U/mL and maximal suppression for concentrations above 20 IU/mL .
Although doses higher than 100 IU/mL caused a mild reduction in maximal specific binding of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; to the VDR , it is apparent that this is not the mechanism responsible for the resistance to 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; .
A concentration of y-IFN of 25 IU/mL exerts maximal inhibition of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; action without affecting 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; binding to the VDR .
The re Downloaded from jcem.endojournals.org on August 11 , 2005 y-INTERFERON INHIBITION OF VITAMIN D ACTION duction in 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels was not caused by a post-tanscriptional effect of the cytokine on the half-life of mRNAs .
An alternative explanation for the reduced 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels is that y-IFN alters the processing of the 24-hydroxylase pre-mRNA to mature mRNA ; however , this is a not a common mechanism for the control of gene expression by steroid hormones .
Thus , y-IFN may directly impair 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; transactivating function .
This antagonism between y-IFN and 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; is physiologically relevant as y-IFN also impairs 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels in normal human monocytes .
24-hydroxylase is expressed in almost every vitamin D-responsive tissue , which raises the possibility that the inhibitory effects of y-IFN on 1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; induction of 24-hydroxylase may not be restricted to monocytes and macrophages .
y-IFN antagonism might extend to renal ( 15 , 16 ) and intestinal ( 17 ) 24-hydroxylases , the major contributors to systemic 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; inactivation .
This notion is supported by the demonstration that , in patients with sarcoidosis , despite the supranormal serum concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , there is no increase in the metabolic clearance rate of 1,25- ( OH ) , ; D , ; ( 43 ) .
The presence of classical vitamin D responsive elements in the promoter region of the human 24-hydroxylase ( 44 ) suggests that the antagonistic effects of y-IFN may extend to other vitamin D-regulated genes .
In fact , y-IFN and TNFa inhibit 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; -induced osteocalcin gene transcription in rat osteoablasts ( 45 , 46 ) .
Both cytokines also induce the expression of the transcription factor AP-1 , and it was proposed that cytokine inhibition of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -induced expression of osteocalcin was the result of the presence of an AP-1 DNA-binding site overlapping the VDR binding domain in the promoter region of the rat osteocalcin gene ( 38 , 47 ) .
This , however , can not be the mechanism mediating the inhibitory effects of y-IFN on 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -induction of 24-hydroxylase gene transcription .
Although there is an AP-1 binding site in the human 24-hydroxylase promoter ( 44 ) , the induction of AP-1 activity with phorbol esters stimulates rather than inhibits 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; transactivating function in kidney ( 18 ) and intestinal ( 19 , 48 ) epithelial cells .
Further studies are necessary to assess whether y-IFN impairs the cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of the 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -VDR complex , the interaction of the complex with the DNA , or steps downstream in the assembly or the preini-tiation complex controlling the rate of 24-hydroxylase gene transcription .
Recent studies of the mechanisms for the inhibition by TNFa of 1,25 ( OH ) , D , modulation of osteocalcin gene expression demonstrated that the cytokine induces an intranu-clear repressor that decreases 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; -stimulated retinoid X receptor-VDR binding to the vitamin D responsive element of the rat osteocalcin gene .
The nucleotide sequence involved is different from the AP-1 binding domain ( 49 , 50 ) .
There has been no further characterization of the mechanisms mediating the inhibitory effect of y-IFN on 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; -induction of the rat osteocalcin gene , except for the demonstration that , unlike TNFa , the effects of y-IFN require ongoing protein synthesis ( 45 ) .
In summary , the studies presented here illustrate that , in 2231 cells of the monocyte macrophage lineage , 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; , suppression of its synthesis is not mediated by rapid , nongenomic mechanisms and that the sterol induces its catabolism by enhancing 24-hydroxylase mRNA levels and activity .
The resistance of activated PAM to 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; in the control of its own production can not be accounted for by the reduced sensitivity to the sterol as monocytes differentiate to macrophages , but results from potent antagonistic effects of the cytokine y-IFEN on 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; action .
These findings could explain the excessive 1,25- ( OH ) , D ; production induced by y-IFN in PAM from patients with sarcoidosis and tuberculosis , and they demonstrate the existence of interactions at the level of gene transcription between the cytokine y-IFN and the steroid hormone 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; in immune cells in humans .
Because macrophages in different tissues display variable phenotypes ( 51 , 52 ) , assessment of a role for y-IFN-1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; , antagonism in the hypercalcemia of other in-flamatory conditions awaits evaluation of cytokine-1,25- ( OH ) ; , D ; interactions in macrophages from tissues involved in those disorders .
Since both y-IFN and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; are potent modulators of cell growth , differentiation , and immune function ( 53-57 ) , the observed antagonism may have pathophysiological repercussions in inflammatory processes beyond those causing abnormal calcium homeostasis .
