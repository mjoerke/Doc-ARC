Leeman , Boston University School of Medicine , Boston , MA , February 18 , 1999 ( received for review December 16 , 1998 ) ABSTRACT Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is a potent stimula-tor of monocytes and macrophages , causing secretion of tumor necrosis factor a ( TNF-a ) and other inflammatory mediators .
Given the deleterious effects to the host of TNF-a , it has been postulated that TNF-a gene expression must be tightly regulated .
The nature of the nuclear factor ( s ) that control TNF-a gene transcription in humans remains obscure , although NF-KB has been suggested .
Our previous studies pertaining to macrophage response to LPS identified a novel DNA-binding domain located from -550 to -487 in the human TNF-a promoter that contains transcriptional activity , but lacks any known NF-KB-binding sites .
We have used this DNA fragment to isolate and purify a 60-kDa protein binding to this fragment and obtained its amino-terminal sequence , which was used to design degenerate probes to screen a cDNA library from THP-1 cells .
A novel cDNA clone ( 1.8 kb ) was isolated and fully sequenced .
Characterization of this cDNA clone revealed that its induction was dependent on LPS activation of THP-1 cells ; hence , the name LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor ( LITAF ) .
Inhibition of LITAF mRNA expression in THP-1 cells resulted in a reduction of TNF-a transcripts .
In addition , high level of expression of LITAF mRNA was observed predominantly in the placenta , peripheral blood leukocytes , lymph nodes , and the spleen .
Finally , chromosomal localization using fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that LITAF mapped to chromosome 16p12-16p13.3 .
Together , these findings suggest that LITAF plays an important role in the activation of the human TNF-a gene and proposes a new mechanism to control TNF-a gene expression .
The innate host response to bacterial pathogens is characterized by an immediate release of biologically active compounds , including monokines and cytokines .
These proinflammatory mol-ecules , which are intended to enable the host to eliminate the pathogen , may adversely affect the host .
Endotoxins , produced from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria , and exo-toxins , released from the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria , are known to be potent inducers of the inflammatory response ( 1 , 2 ) .
Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , extracted from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria , has been identified as a principal endotoxic component .
It is well known that LPS is one of the most potent stimulators of monocytes and macrophages , leading to the secretion of nitrogen intermediates , prostaglandins , and cytokines .
Secretion of tumor necrosis factor « ( TNF-a @ ) , IL-1 , IL-6 , and IL-12 , demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro ( 3 , 4 ) , leads to rapid induction and amplification of the host response to infection ( 5-8 ) .
In turn , other cells are induced to produce large quantities of IL-1 , TNF , IL-6 , and IL-8 , which mediate the induction of fever ( 6 , 7 , 9 ) , synthesis of acute-phase proteins ( 10 ) , release of collagenase ( 8 ) , and synthesis of prostaglandin ( 11 ) .

4518 situations , the pathogen often is eliminated , with resolution of inflammation and minimal tissue damage .
However , failure to control the pathogen often leads to a state of metabolic anarchy in which the inflammatory response is not controlled and significant tissue damage results .
Although the inflammatory response is mediated by a variety of secreted factors , the cytotoxic effects of LPS have been ascribed to TNF-a activity ( 4 , 12 , 13 ) .
TNF-a is a pleiotropic cytokine and may benefit the host or exert detrimental effects on the host ( 14-16 ) .
TNF-a helps prevent cancer ( 17 ) , protects against infection ( 18-21 ) , promotes tissue remodeling ( 22 ) , and activates inflammatory responses ( 23 ) .
Conversely , TNF-a mediates septic shock in chronic infections ( 4 , 24 , 25 ) , is responsible for cachexia in cancer patients ( 26 ) , causes inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis patients ( 27 , 28 ) , and activates HIV ( 29-32 ) .
The pleiotropic effects of TNF-a are dose-dependent ( 33 ) .
Hence , the perceived need to control TNF-a production has raised interest into the understanding of the mechanisms that modulate TNF-a gene expression .
It is well known that gene transcription is controlled by DNA-binding proteins ( 34 ) .
Recently , several groups have examined the transcriptional regulation of TNF-a by various in-ducers , such as virus , LPS , and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) ( 35-45 ) .
The human TNF-a promoter contains motifs that resemble sites ; however , controversy exists as to the involvement of NF-kB in TNF-a gene regulation .
These sequences do not seem to be necessary for virus or LPS induction , nor do they appear to be able to stimulate virus or LPS induction alone ( 35 ) .
However , it has been suggested that NF-kB is an important factor in TNF-a gene transcription in LPS-challenged monocytes and macrophages .
NF-kB-binding motifs are found in the human TNF-a promoter region ( 46 , 47 ) and were shown to translocate into the nuclei of LPS-stimulated monocytes ( 36 , 48 , 49 ) .
In mice , mutation ( s ) or deletion ( s ) of NF- « B-binding motifs on the TNF-a promoter failed to show reporter gene activation in transfected cells ( 37 , 50 , 51 ) .
However , in humans , TNF- « promoter activity in transfected cell lines was found to be independent of the NF- « B-binding motifs ( 52 ) .
Drouet et al .
( 37 ) offered an explanation for these conflicting data , suggesting that enough NF-KB is constitutively expressed to sustain high-level baseline expression of the human TNF-a gene ( 52 ) compared with the mouse .
Nonetheless , the nature of the nuclear factor ( s ) involved in the regulation of LPS-induced TNF-a gene expression in humans remains unknown .
Our previous studies pertaining to macrophage response to LPS have identified a DNA sequence domain located from -550 to -487 in the human TNF-a promoter ( 53 ) .

phoretic mobility-shift assays and selective mutations , it was shown that a 64-bp fragment located within this region can bind unknown protein ( s ) and this binding is responsible for TNF-a transcriptional activity .
Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed the absence of any potential NF- « B-binding sites ( 53 ) .
These intriguing results suggested the existence of a novel cis-acting regulatory protein , other than NF-KB , that is necessary for human TNF-a gene transcription .
In an effort to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of LPS-induced TNF-a gene regulation , we used this 64-bp fragment to isolate the purported native protein .
Its amino-terminal sequence was obtained and used to design PCR primers to screen a THP-1 cDNA library .
Using these probes , we isolated a novel full-length cDNA ( 1.8 kb ) with a deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF encoding 229 aa .
Characterization of this new gene revealed that its expression resulted from LPS stimulation of THP cells ; hence , the name LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor ( LITAF ) .
We investigated tissue distribution of the LITAF gene and found transcripts in a variety of human adult tissues .
Northern blot hybridization revealed a high level of expression in the placenta , peripheral blood leukocytes , lymph nodes , and the spleen .
Inhibition of LITAF mRNA translation using antisense DNA in naive THP-1 cells or those exposed to LPS resulted in a reduction of TNF-a transcripts .
In addition , chromosomal localization using fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) revealed that LITAF mapped to chromosome 16p12-16p13.3 .
Together , these findings suggest that the LITAF gene may play an important role in human TNF-a gene activation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture .
The human monocytic cell line , THP-1 , was maintained in complete RPMI [ C-RPMI ; RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine/25 mM Hepes/100 units/ml of penicillin/100 mg/ml of streptomycin/10 % FBS ( all from GIBCO ) ] .
LPS -free tissue culture reagents were used for all experiments .
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts from Cultured THP-1 Cells .
THP-1 cells were induced to maturation by incubation in 200 nM PMA ( Sigma ) for 20 hr and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml of Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS ( 54 ) for 2 hr .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as described in our previous work ( 53 ) .
Preparation of DNA Affinity Beads .
The 64-bp initiator element located from -550 to -487 in the human TNF-a promoter ( 55 ) was amplified by PCR .
The PCR mixture ( 50 ml ) was prepared as described previously ( 55 ) .
The human TNF-a promoter ( 55 ) was used as the template for the PCR .
We used the sequence 5-TGAGGCCTCAAGCTGCCACCA-3 ' for the forward primer sequence and 5'-XTGAGGCCTGTGTTT-GGGTCTG-3 ' for the reverse sequence ( X = 5 ' biotin ) .
The cycling parameters ( 30 cycles ) were as follows : an initial dena-turation at 94°C for 1 min , annealing at 55°C for 1 min , and elongation at 72°C for 1 min .
The last cycle had an additional elongation time of 7 min .
The PCR products were separated on agarose gel , and the 64-bp DNA bands were cut from the gel .
The unincorporated biotinylated primers were removed by using the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit ( Qiagen ) .
The biotinylated DNA was desalted and dissolved in TrisHCI/EDTA ( 2 mg/m ! )
and then used for the preparation of DNA affinity beads .
Immobilization of labeled DNA to Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin ( 10 mg/ml ; Dynal , Great Neck , NY ) was performed as described by Gabrielsen and Huet ( 56 ) .
Briefly , a suspension of beads was coupled with the labeled DNA at room temperature for 30 min .
The affinity beads were washed to remove unbound DNA and then used for purification of DNA-binding protein .
Purification of DNA-Binding Protein Using Affinity Beads .
Purification of the protein binding to the beads was performed as described previously ( 56 ) .
Briefly , the nuclear extracts were incubated with the beads in binding buffer containing poly ( dI-dC ) at room temperature .
After washing ( twice ) , the DNA Proc .

USA 96 ( 1999 ) 4519 binding protein was eluted , desalted , and then used for further analysis .
Isolation of the DNA-Binding Protein and Sequence Analysis .
The eluted protein sample was separated on 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described previously ( 53 ) .
The resolved proteins ( approximately 2 % of the protein of the total protein ) were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described by Matsudaira ( 57 ) and stained with Coomassie blue .
A predominant-stained protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa was excised .
After treatment with trypsin ( 58 ) , the resultant peptides were separated by HPLC on a C18 column with a 0-100 % acetonitrile gradient containing 0.01 % trifluoroacetic acid ( 58 ) .
Fractions were collected , and a number of peptides were sequenced by established methods as described previously ( 57 ) .
All peptide sequences were found in the isolated cDNA clone .
Degenerate oligonucleotides ( 16-mer ) corresponding to either end of peptide 1 , M-S-V-P-G-P-Y-Q-A-A-T-G , were used for PCR by using the LPS-induced THP-1 cDNA as a template to obtain a DNA fragment containing the exact nucleotide sequences encoding the middle part of this peptide .
PCR products resolved in an 8 % acrylamide gel were eluted by using the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit ( Qiagen ) and subcloned into a PCR II vector ( Invitrogen ) .
Sequencing verified the fidelity of the PCR products .
Screening the cDNA Library .
An LPS-stimulated , PMA-induced , custom-made human THP-1 Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library ( Stratagene ) was screened by using this PCR probe , and nine positive clones containing 0.8- to 1.8-kb inserts were obtained after screening 5 X 10° colonies .
The longest cDNA insert ( 1.8 kb ) was chosen for complete sequencing after the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method by using a 373A sequencer ( Applied Biosystems ) .
The BLAST program was used to search the database through the National Center for Biotechnology Information .
The PILEUP and PRETTYBOX programs were used for sequence alignments and comparisons .
The FASTA program was used for calculating the protein identities .
All these computer programs were from the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group , Madison , WI .
Finally , the SIGSCAN program was used to search the Transcription Factor Database ( TFD ) through the BIMaASs program of the Advanced Biosciences Computing Systems maintained at the University of Minnesota .
Detection of LITAF Gene Transcripts .
The transcripts for the new gene were detected by Northern blot analysis in cultured THP-1 cells and other human tissues .
First , THP-1 cells ( 5 x 10° ) were induced to maturation by incubation in 200 nM PMA ( Sigma ) for 20 hr and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml of P. gingivalis LPS ( 54 ) for 2 hr .
Noninduced THP-1 cells also were cultured .
Total cellular RNA was collected by using RNA STAT-60 ( Tel-Test , Friendswood , TX ) by the method described in the instruction manual , and poly ( A ) RNA ( mRNA ) was recovered by using the Oligotex mRNA Kit ( Qiagen ) .
mRNA was size-fractionated on denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel ( 1.1 % ) and transferred onto a Hybond-N* membrane ( Amersham ) as described previously ( 59 ) .
Northern blot filters with mRNA from several different human tissues were obtained from CLON-TECH .
These filters were hybridized with an °S-labeled cRNA probe at 60°C overnight in 50 % formamide/5x SSC/5 % Den-hardt 's solution/0.1 % SDS/50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 6.9/ heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA .
The filters were washed three times in 0.1 % SSC/0.1 % SDS at 68°C for 30 min and then autoradiographed with BIOMAX MBR film ( Kodak ) .
The 511 bp of the Hincll-Apal cDNA fragment from the coding sequence in the new gene ( Fig .

mRNA was recovered from the cells as described previously .
Successful recovery of mRNA from each sample was monitored by Northern blot hybridization with a B-actin probe .
The 355-bp TNF- « cDNA was obtained from a PMA-induced human THP-1 Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library ( Stratagene ) by PCR with specific primers for TNF-a mRNA ( Strat-agene ) .
After the cDNA was subcloned to a Smal site of pGEMT7Zf ( + ) , the TNF-a cDNA was identified by sequencing .

RESULTS Screening , Sequencing , and Structural Analysis of LITAF cDNA .
As shown in Fig .
2 , the cDNA consists of a 234-nt 5 ' noncoding region , a 687-nt ORF , and an 852-nt 3 ' noncoding region that includes a poly ( A ) signal .
The ORF encodes a 228-aa , 23.9-kDa protein ( GenBank accession no .
U77396 ) .
At the time that the DNA sequencing was almost completed , the clone was entered in GenBank as TNF- « -induced mRNA and did not have any homology with nucleotide and protein sequences available in all public databases .
Polyak et al .
( 62 ) then examined transcripts markedly induced by the p53 gene .
Among them , an expressed sequence tag named PIG7 was found to harbor 98 % homology with TNF- « -induced mRNA ( 62 ) .
We have , in the present report , renamed this cDNA LITAF because it is induced by LPS and affects TNF-a gene expression .
Induction of LITAF Gene mRNA .
Northern blot analysis clearly indicated that a single 1.8-kb mRNA encoding the LITAF gene was present in LPS-induced PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells .
The size of the transcript was consistent with the sequence data .
The expression of the LITAF gene occurred only in LPS-induced , PMA-differentiated THP -1 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
No signal was found in PMA-differentiated cells in the absence of LPS stimulation , in LPS-stimulated cells in the absence of PMA differentiation , or in unstimulated THP-1 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Expression Patterns of the Novel Gene in Human Tissues .
As shown in Fig .
4 , a 1.8-kb transcript was significantly expressed in spleen , lymph node , and peripheral blood leukocytes .
Moderate expression was observed in thymus , appendix , bone marrow , kidney , and placenta .
Little expression was found in pancreas , skeletal muscle , liver , and lung whereas a very minor expression was observed in heart , brain , and fetal liver .
The size of the transcripts again was consistent with the sequence results and confirms that the cDNA isolated was the full-length clone .
Antisense and Sense LITAF mRNA Constructs and Expression .
To determine the biological activity of the isolated LITAF gene , THP-1 cells were transfected with the following constructs : LITAF antisense RNA ( AS5 ' ) , LITAF sense RNA construct ( s ) , or vector alone .
Using LITAF antisense RNA as a probe , a 1.8-kb transcript was detected in sense-transfected cells ( Fig .

Nucleotide sequence of LITAF and its deduced amino acid sequence .
The full-length LITAF cDNA was isolated from a cDNA library of PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS .
This sequence has been submitted to GenBank and has been assigned accession no .
U77396 .
The ORF encodes 228 aa with a predicted molecular mass of 23.9 kDa .
The Alu sequence is underlined .
using LITAF sense RNA as a probe , we detected a band of approximately 400 bp in antisense-transfected cells ( Fig .

( 4 and B ) Expression of the LITAF gene .
The preblotted filters ( CLONTECH ] ) were hybridized with the antisense RNA probe that corresponded to the coding region of the LITAF gene , as described in Materials and Methods .
ellite was confirmed by double-labeling with a commercial probe , D16Z2 ( Oncor ) .
The probe had specificity for this site , because symmetrical signals were not observed on other chromosomes .
The FISH signals were localized relative to the chromosome bands and the LITAF gene locus assigned to chromosome 16 pl2-16p13.3 .
DISCUSSION The present paper reports the cloning , characterization , and chromosomal assignment of an LPS-induced gene named LIT AF that affects TNF-a gene expression in cells of monocytic lineage .
The cDNA encoding LITAF was isolated by screening an LPS-induced THP-1 expression library with degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the native nuclear protein isolated .
Functional studies aimed at interfering with LITAF mRNA expression by using antisense RNA in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells exposed to LPS resulted in a reduction of TNF-a transcripts .
In humans this gene has been localized to chromosome 16p12-16p13.3 .
All the public nucleotide and protein sequence databases were searched .
None of the sequences in the coding region were found to be similar to typical DNA-binding motifs .

< 2 w E Total RNA was recovered from 2 x 10° C £8 [ 2 ] cells after differentiation with PMA and eas4 < stimulation with P. gingivalis LPS .
The RNAs were hybridized with the TNF-a @ antisense RNA probe .
After treatment with RNase A and T1 , protected bands were electrophoresed through an 8 % polyacrylamide gel , and the dried gel was exposed to x-ray film .
No protected band is observed in AS5'-transfected cells .
The band density observed in SE-transfected cells was found to be similar to the band in MOCK cells .
Left lane , native TNF-a antisense probe .
-- 446 base -a- 335 base quences in two other regions of the gene ( 5 ' and 3 ' UTRs ) that displayed some homology with sequences reported in the data-bases : several amino acid sequences were found to be similar to the Bicaudal-C gene of Drosophila melanogaster .
Although the Bicaudal-C gene product contains a motif called the KH domain , which is found in many RNA and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins ( 63 ) , we did not find a typical KH domain in the LITAF gene .
In addition , sequencing of the LITAF gene revealed Alu elements in the 3 ' noncoding region ( Fig .
2 ) .
Several investigators have reported that Alu elements constitute approximately 5 % of the human genome and often are found in introns or 3 ' UTRs .
However , the Alu region mistakenly may be incorporated into ORFs ( 84 ) .
To determine whether the presence of the Alu element was a result of alternative splicing from an adjacent intron , the other two cognate clones were sequenced .
We found that the nucleotide sequences of the cognate clones significantly overlapped , indicating that the presence of the Alu region in the cDNA probably was not caused by a splicing error .
Recently , Neuenchwander et al .
( 64 ) reported that stable antisense RNA expression inhibits the translation of sense RNA .
In a number of studies ( 65-68 ) , stable antisense RNA expression has resulted in a decrease in endogenous mRNA levels .
Although the mechanism responsible for this decrease remains unclear , it may be related to the inhibition of RNA synthesis , RNA splicing , mRNA export , binding of initiation factors , assembly of ribosome subunits , and sliding of the ribosome along the mRNA coding sequence , all of which result in translation arrest ( 69 ) .
Therefore , we attempted to interfere with LITAF gene activity at the mRNA level by transfecting antisense oligonucleotide-producing vectors into THP-1 cells .
The most common mRNA target site reported in the literature is the AUG translation initiation codon ( 70 ) .
However , we have found in many cases that oligonucleotides that target other regions in the mRNA , such as 5 ' and 3 ' UTRs , were more effective ( 71-74 ) .
Therefore , to interfere with LITAF mRNA , we transfected vectors producing antisense oligonucleotides that target the 5 ' region of the LITAF mRNA , and , for the overexpression of the LITAF mRNA , a vector producing the full-length LITAF mRNA was transfected .
Using sense LITAF RNA as a probe , a band of approximately 400 bp was detected in ASS `` -transfected cells , consistent with the design of the antisense vector .
No significant signal was detected in mock-transfected cells .
When the full-length sense LITAF mRNA was transfected in THP-1 cells , an intense signal for LITAF mRNA was detected at 1.8 kb by using an antisense LITAF mRNA probe , reflecting the overexpression of LITAF mRNA , which confirmed the stable expression of RNA from each construct .
However , when the same probe was used , ASS `` -transfected cells weakly expressed the LITAF gene ( Fig .
5 ) .
It is possible that the interference of LITAF expression with the antisense was not complete and LITAF antisense-transfected cells continued to exhibit little expression of the LITAF gene partly as a compensatory mechanism to restore the function , although the mechanisms involved in this phenomena remain unknown .

FISH localization of human LITAF gene .
Metaphase chromosome spread after hybridization with a biotinylated LITAF probe .
The banding is observed on chromosome 16p12-16p13.3 .
Using the RNase protection assay , examination of the effect of antisense RNA on transcription of the human TNF-a gene revealed that the signal indicating the TNF- « mRNA level was weaker in antisense-expressing cells than in mock cells .
However , similar amounts of B-actin mRNA were found in both cells .
The reduction of TNF- « mRNA that occurs when LITAF gene mRNA activity is arrested strongly suggests that LITAF gene products play an important role in the regulation of human TNF-a gene transcription .
In addition , the expression level of TNF- « mRNA was not enhanced in the sense-expressing cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
The scope of our functional study is not broad enough for us to rule out the possibility that exogenous LITAF gene products may regulate TNF-a gene transcription in other ways than what occurs naturally .
We posit three possibilities for how the LITAF gene product may regulate gene transcription : ( ? )
the LITAF gene may have to be processed as a protein to activate the TNF-a gene ; ( i ) the endogenous LITAF gene product is enough to activate the TNF-a gene ; and ( # ? )
the exogenous LITAF gene product acts after protein processing because a large amount of LITAF mRNA is constitutively transcribed in the cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
Nonetheless , the present data support recent data suggesting that LPS induction of TNF-a promoter may be mediated by the concerted participation of at least two separate , cis-acting regulatory elements ( 75 ) .
Distribution of LITAF mRNA on various tissue blots revealed that the LITAF gene is expressed in most of the tissues tested ; however , it is expressed more predominantly in hematolympho-poeitic tissues and placenta , kidney , and pancreas .
This distribution of LITAF transcripts seems to parallel TNF-a tissue distribution during endotoxemia ( 76 , 77 ) .
The potential role of LITAF in human disease is implicated by the recent finding that p53 induces the expression of the LITAF gene ( 62 ) and by its chromosomal localization at 16p12-16p13.3 .
The p53 tumor-suppressor protein is thought to play a major role in the defense of the cell against agents that damage DNA ( 78 , 79 ) .
Loss of function of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene is a frequent and important event in the genesis or progression of many human malignancies .
Loss of p53-dependent apoptosis is believed to be critical to carcinogenesis in many of these cases , suggesting the possibility to therapeutically restore this pathway and directly eliminate malignant cells or increase or restore their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents ( 78 , 79 ) .
The regulation of p53-dependent responses is complex and variable between cell types , and whether a cell undergoes apoptosis after activation of p53 is highly sensitive to signal context , including environmental and cell-intrinsic influences .
Further insight has been provided into the activation of latent p53 , the biochemical mechanisms involved in growth arrest and apoptosis , and the influence of various signals on these cellular effects .
Additionally , roles for p53 Immunology : Myokai et al .
have been described in cell senescence , suppressing teratogenesis , and processes that may contribute directly to the maintenance of genomic stability ( 78 , 79 ) .
Recently , various monocytic cell lines have been shown to respond to LPS and interferon y with endogenous nitric oxide ( NO ) formation ( 80 ) , which , in turn , activates the expression of p53 , leading to apoptosis ( 81 ) .
Fur-thermore , p53 has been shown recently to modulate the activity of various inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 ( 82 ) , IL-2 , and IL-4 ( 83 ) .
In light of the present data , a potential , new pS53-dependent pathway affecting TNF-a gene expression can be proposed : LPS stimulation of monocyte /macrophages can induce NO production .
In turn , NO can up-regulate p53 , which would stimulate the expression of the LITAF gene .
Ultimately , the induction of the LITAF gene product would affect TNF-a gene expression .
The validity of this pathway remains to be substan-tiated .
Altogether , the present data suggest that the novel LITAF gene product might be a crucial factor for the control of TNF-a gene expression .
