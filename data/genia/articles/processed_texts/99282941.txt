Vallejo , `` Johann C. Brandes , `` Cornelia M. Weyand , and Jorg J. Goronzy `` The costimulatory molecule CD28 has a restricted tissue distribution and is expressed on T cells and some plasmacytoma cells .
Although CD28 is constitutively expressed , its expression is transiently down-regulated following T cell activation and declines progressively with in vitro senescence .
In vivo , CD8 * T cells and , less frequently , CD4* T cells may completely lose CD28 surface expression during chronic infections and with aging .
This correlates with changes of nuclear protein-binding activities to two motifs , site & and $ , within the CD28 minimal promoter .
Both a- and -bound complexes are found only in lymphoid tissues , in CD28 * T cells , and in some transformed B cells .
These complexes are coordinately expressed except during replicative senescence , which is characterized by the down-modulation of site B- but not site « -binding activities .
In contrast , T cell activation induces a parallel decline in both site & - and -binding activities .
CD4* and CD8* T cells differ in their -binding profiles , which may explain the more pronounced down-regulation of CD28 in senescent CD8* T cells .
In vivo expanded CD4*CD28 `` `` `` and CD8* CD28 `` T cells uniformly lack a- and -bound complexes , resembling the pattern seen in chronically activated cells and not of senescent cells .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 162 : 6572-6579. in the generation of T cell-mediated immune responses ( 1 , 2 ) .
Upon interaction with its ligands CD80 and CD86 , CD28 transduces activation signals that lead to the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and enhance the synthesis of several cyto-kines including IL-2 .
Hence , T cells should either become anergic or undergo apoptosis in the absence of CD28-mediated signals ( 3-6 ) .
Mice with targeted deletion of the CD28 gene are severely immunocompromised .
These gene-knockout animals are unable to form germinal centers in response to immunization , and CD28 `` `` `` T cells can initiate , but not sustain , proliferation ( 7-10 ) .
These observations attest to the critical role of CD28 in T cell-mediated immunity .
CD28 is expressed on nearly all human CD4 * T cells .
However , CD4TCD28 `` `` `` T cells do emerge to detectable levels in some individuals with aging ( 11 ) .
These unusual T cells are also found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) * ( 12 ) .
Previous studies have shown that this deficiency in CD28 expression is due to a transcriptional block .
CD28 gene expression is associated with the presence of nuclear proteins binding to two distinct sequence motifs , site « and B , within the minimal promoter of the CD28 gene ( 11 ) .
Mutations in either sequence motif abrogate CD28 gene promoter activities , suggesting that an interaction between proteins binding to both sequences is required for CD28 expression .

Copyright © 1999 by The American Association of Immunologists CD4 T cells lack DNA-binding activities for both sequence motifs .
Although CD28 is constitutively expressed on CD4 * T cells , its level of surface expression is not static .
At least two mechanisms influencing CD28 expression have been reported , TCR-mediated activation ( 1 , 13 ) and in vitro replicative senescence ( 14 , 15 ) .
Modulation of CD28 cell surface expression is of particular importance because the biological outcome of T cell stimulation is dependent on the interplay of four molecules with very different functions , i.e .
, CD28 and CD152 with their ligands , CD80 and CD86 ( 1 ) .
CD28 and CD152 are related glycoproteins but differ greatly in their binding properties to CD80 and CD86 ( 16 , 17 ) .
They both have fast on/off rates for CD80/CD86 ; however , CD152 has a 10-fold higher affinity for these molecules than does CD28 .
Additionally , homodimerization of CD152 has been reported to increase its avidity for CD80 ( 18-20 ) .
Differences in the patterns of cell surface expression of CD28 and CD152 will , therefore , have immediate impact on whether a positive CD28-mediated signal or a negative CD152-mediated signal prevails .
We have now explored the roles of the CD28-associated a- and -specific complexes in fine-tuning the level of CD28 expression .
Surprisingly , these two nuclear protein complexes were detected exclusively in lymphoid cells and , in most instances , their binding activities were coordinated .
Upon TCR ligation , transient diminution of both DNA-binding activities was observed accompanied by the down-regulation of CD28 expression .
In contrast , there was a progressive loss of CD28 expression during replicative senescence that was associated with a decrease in site B- , but not in site & - , binding activity .
These data indicate that CD28 expression is controlled by protein complexes binding to sites « and B .
However , distinct mechanisms lead to CD28 down-regulation following T cell activation and during replicative senescence .
Materials and Methods Cell culture T cell clones were established by limiting dilution cloning as described previously ( 12 , 21 ) .
The clones were derived from PBMC of healthy do nors or RA patients , some of whom have participated in previous studies ( 11 , 22-24 ) .
Culture conditions for these clones have been described ( 11 ) .

After 10 days , CD4* and CD8 * T cells were separated by negative selection using the VarioMACS system ( Miltenyi Biotec , Auburn , CA ) or by standard panning protocols .
The purity of these lymphocyte populations was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of cells stained for CD3 , CD4 , and CD8 .
Sublines of CD28* and CD28 `` `` `` cells from both CD4* and CD8* T cell lines were established by standard FACS procedures .
These cell lines were maintained by a weekly stimulation with y-irradiated neuraminidase/galactose oxidase-treated EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines and 15 U/ml exogenous IL-2 .
The plasmacytoma cell lines ANBL/6 , KAS6/1 , and KP6 ( provided by Dr. Diane Jelinek , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN ) were originally isolated from patients with multiple myeloma ( 25 , 26 ) .
They were maintained in RPMI 1640 ( BioWhittaker , Walkersville , MD ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ( Summit Biotech , Ft. Collins , CO ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 ug/ml !
streptomycin ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) , and 1 ng/ml human recombinant IL-6 ( Genzyme , Cambridge , MA ) .
The EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines ( BIN40 , HT1O , MGAR , Rei , and TABO85 ) used in this study were established in our laboratory by standard protocols or were obtained from the 11th Histocompatibility Workshop .
The PJL cell line ( 27 ) was provided by Dr. Paul Leibson ( Mayo Clinic ) .
These cell lines were maintained in the same culture media used for the plasmacytomas but without the addition of IL-6 .
Various cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) .
These include the B cell line , Ramos ; the T cell lines , Jurkat , HUT78 , and 6TCEM20 ; the epithelial carcinoma lines , HeLa and Colo320HSR ; the erythroleukemia line , K562 ; the promonocytic line U937 ; and the rhabdomyosarcoma line , RD .
Cells were propagated according to ATCC recommendations .
Flow cytometry Phenotypes of cells were periodically examined by standard flow cytometry procedures .
This involved triple immunofluorescence staining with Abs to CD3 , CD4 , and CD8 and analysis by FACSVantage or FACSCali-bur cytometers ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) .
Each experiment included cells incubated with isotype controls ( Simultest , Becton Dickinson } .
Analysis of cell populations were done using the WinMDI program ( J.Trot-ter , Scripps , La Jolla , CA ) .
Reverse transcriptase-PCR The presence of CD28 mRNA in the various cells was assessed by standard RT-PCR .
Experiments were conducted using amplification primers appropriately designed to detect the different splice forms of CD28 mRNA ( 28 , 29 ) .
To amplify CD28 transcripts containing exons 1 , 2 , and 3 , PCR was done with the primers CTCAGGCTGCTCTITTGGCTCTC , CGCCCAT GCTTGTAGCGTACG , and CAAGCCAGGACTCCACCAACC , respectively , paired with the common primer GATAGGCTGCGAAGTCGCGTC corresponding to the 3'-end of exon 4 .
PCR products were fractionated in 2 % agarose gels .
T cell activation There were two T cell activation procedures .
In one set of experiments , triplicate cultures of 5 X 10° T cells were incubated with autologous , freshly isolated , plastic-adherent monocytes and 5 pg/ml soluble anti-CD3 Ab ( OKT3 , ATCC ) .
In other studies , T cell cultures were incubated on immobilized OKT3 and the anti-CD28 mAb 28.2 ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) .
The OKT3 ( 100 ng/m ! )
and 28.2 ( 300 ng/m ! )
mAbs were immobilized on rabbit anti-mouse Ig-coated plates .
These Ab concentrations were determined to induce proliferation of freshly isolated and short term T cell lines .
As system controls , T cell cultures that were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA and 10 nM ionomycin ( Sigma ) or T cells were incubated with IgG isotype controls .
Nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) Surgical tissue specimens were obtained from the Surgical Pathology Lab-oratories , Mayo Clinic , cut into small pieces , and digested with collagenase by standard techniques .
Single-cell suspensions were obtained , and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously ( 11 , 30 ) .
Briefly , between 5 X 10° and 1 X 10 `` cells were lysed in cold HEPES hypotonic buffer , and the nuclei were isolated by centrifugation .
Nuclear proteins were extracted in 50 pl of a high salt buffer ( 31 ) , and protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) .
Similar nuclear extract preparations were made with cell lines as indicated .

- Structure of the CD28 minimal promoter .
The proximal 400 bp flanking the translation initiation codon has been found to comprise the minimal CD28 promoter ( 11 ) .
Two sequence motifs , sites « and B , situated downstream from the CAAT and TATA boxes have been identified to play a central role in the regulation of CD28 expression .
CD4 T cells uniformly show a lack of specific nuclear factor binding activities to both sequences .
Furthermore , mutations in either motif have been shown to effectively inactivate the transcriptional activity of the minimal promoter .
EMSAs were conducted as described previously ( 11 , 30 ) , Briefly , ~20 ug of nuclear extract were combined with 30 pl of binding buffer containing 3 pg of poly ( dI-dC ) ( ICN Pharmaceuticals , Costa Mesa , CA ) and 3 ug of nonspecific oligonucleotide .
To this mixture , 5 pl of wash buffer were added , and the total reaction volume was adjusted to 50 pl with binding buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min .
About 40 fmol of radio-labeled probes were added and incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature .
The sequences of oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the site « and B motifs were synthesized as indicated in Fig .
1 .
Protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography .
Generally , each experiment consisted of replicate reactions of two separate preparations of nuclear extracts of the same cell line .
The reproducibility of EMSAs was assessed by repeated experiments as indicated .
As in previous work ( 11 ) , the specificities of e-/B-binding activities were validated by three criteria : 1 ) the higher mobility of « -bound complexes compared with B-bound complexes ; 2 ) the lack of reciprocal competition between the two motifs ; and 3 ) by irrelevant probes .
The irrelevant probes ( Ets-1 , Elk-1 , AP3 , and NFB ) have been described previously .
The SP1 sequence was used as an experimental system control ( 11 , 30 ) .
Results Expression of CD28-specific transcription factors in CD28 `` and CD28 `` lymphoid cells In previous studies ( 11 ) , we demonstrated that CD28 expression on CD4* T cells was correlated with nuclear proteins binding to sequence motifs in the CD28 minimal promoter , referred to as sites a and ( Fig .
1 ) .
In EMSAs , probes corresponding to site « yielded a single band , while a faster and a slower migrating band were found with probes corresponding to site .
Introduction of mutations into either motif resulted in the inactivation of promoter ac-tivity , suggesting that CD28 expression requires the coordinated binding of nuclear proteins to both sequence motifs .
To explore the correlation between CD28 expression and CD28-specific transcription factors , we analyzed various lymphoid cells that differ in CD28 expression .
Representative flow cytometric analysis of various cell lines is shown in Fig .
2 , and the results are summarized in Table I. CD4* and CD8 * T cells were sorted for their expression of CD28 , and CD28* and CD28 `` `` `` T cells were analyzed separately .
The vast majority of peripheral blood CD4* T cells expressed the CD28 molecule .
A subset of CD28 `` `` `` CD4* T cells existed only in some individuals , in whom such cells comprised < 5 % of the CD4 T cell compartment ( 11 ) .
However , CD8TCD28 `` `` `` T cells were common ( data not shown ) .
All CD28 `` `` `` T cells lacked CD28 mRNA as determined by RT-PCR ( Table I ) .
Cell surface density of CD28 on peripheral CD28 and CD28 *CD4* T cells was equivalent ( Fig .
2 ) .
In contrast to T cells , plasmacytoma cells and some EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines had a dim expression of CD28 .
In Fig .

Levels of CD28 cell surface expression of CD28 on various T and B cell lines were determined by flow cytometry .
High levels of CD28 expression ( solid lines ) were generally seen on short term CD4* and CD8* T cell lines .
In contrast , plasmacytoma lines and some EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines showed significantly lower but detectable levels of anti-CD28 staining when compared with isotype controls ( dashed lines ) .
Examination of a panel of lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines showed a correlation between CD28 cell surface expression and specific transcripts ( see Table I ) .

ANBL/6 and KAS6/1 .
Both cell lines had low levels of CD28 expression as determined by flow cytometry and transcribed CD28 mRNA as determined by RT-PCR .
The lymphoblastoid cell line PJL had a minimal cell surface staining for CD28 and expressed CD28 mRNA , whereas the lymphoblastoid B cell line MGAR was negative for CD28 mRNA and lacked cell surface CD28 expression .
Nuclear extracts from all of the cell types shown in Table I were analyzed for proteins binding to sites « and 3 of the CD28 minimal promoter .
Results shown in Fig .
3 demonstrate a correlation between the presence of site a-bound complexes ( band A ) and CD28 expression , irrespective of the cell surface density of the molecule .
Among the T and B cell lines examined , the expression of site « -specific proteins was highly correlated with the presence of CD28 mRNA .
The results were more complex for site B .
Although all CD28 * and no CD28 `` `` `` cells showed site -binding activities , the mobility patterns of the DNA-protein complexes varied among the different cell types .
CD4*CD28 * T cells and the CD28 * T cell tumor line Jurkat showed two B-bound complexes , a slow mobility B1 band and a faster mobility B2 band ( Fig .
3 ) .
In contrast , the CD28 CD8 * T cells , as well as the CD28 * plasmacytoma and EBV -transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines had a complete loss or significant diminution of the slow migrating B1 complex .
The diminution of the B1 complex was apparently not responsible for the low expression of CD28 on B cells .
CD8 * T cells lacking this band showed a level of CD28 cell surface expression that was equivalent to CD4 * T cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Expression of CD28-specific transcription factors is limited to lymphoid tissue As depicted in Fig .
3 , the presence of site a- and B-binding proteins in lymphoid cells was strictly correlated with CD28 expression .
Moreover , the presence of these DNA-protein complexes was highly synchronous in that none of the CD28 * cells examined REGULATORY MOTIFS CONTROLLING CD28 EXPRESSION Table I .

expressed only one of these two complexes .
Consistent with previous data ( 11 ) , reciprocal competition assays showed that site « and BB probes do not block motif-specific binding activities .
To determine whether « - and B-bound complexes are truly lym-phoid-specific and are synchronously expressed , we examined a series of tissues .
As shown in Fig .
4 , site a- and B-binding activities were found only in the spleen and were uniformly absent in all other tissues examined .
Reciprocal competitive EMSAs between the two sequences revealed that the binding activities of splenic extracts were site a- and -specific ( data not shown ) .
In addition to the surgical tissue specimens shown in Fig .
4 , the proerythroid leukemia cell line K562 , the promonocytic cell line U937 , the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD , and the epithelioid carcinoma cell lines HeLa and Colo320HSR were analyzed .
These cell lines expressed CD28 at neither the protein nor the mRNA levels ( Table I ) .
In EMSAs , these cells also lacked binding activities to site a and B sequences ( data not shown ) .
Modulation of CD28 expression following T cell activation Although CD28 is constitutively expressed on T cells , studies have indicated that activating stimuli induce a transient reduction in the levels of CD28 expression ( 1 , 13 ) .
Indeed , T cells cocultured with autologous monocytes in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb elicited the down-regulation of CD28 on the cell surface after 24 h of 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology 6575 site o. site B FIGURE 3 .

54 ) .
We then examined whether this phenomenon may be associated with the specific transcription factors binding to site a and B of the CD28 gene promoter .
As depicted in Fig .
5B , T cell stimulation resulted in a parallel reduction in the levels of specific binding activities to both motifs within 24 h after stimulation .
These reductions in site a- and B-binding activities were seen in both CD4* and CD8 * T cells .
The activation-induced changes in both the cell surface expression of CD28 and the -/ -binding activities were transient .
The levels of « -/B-binding activities returned to baseline levels after 72 h , whereas the cell surface levels of CD28 returned to preactivation levels between 72 and 96 h ( data not shown ) .
In agreement with previous reports ( 1 , 6 ) , stimulation of cells with ionomycin and PMA induced a similar pattern of transient down-regulation of CD28 and in site a- and B-activities ( data not shown ) .
Effect of CD28 cross-linking on CD28 expression In the above experiments , activation of T cells was presumably accomplished by the simultaneous engagement of the TCR-CD3 complex and CD28 by OKT3 and CD80/CD86 , respectively , presented on monocytes .
To directly assess whether these observations could be attributed to TCR-CD3 and/or CD28 engagement , Ab cross-linking experiments were conducted .
T cells were cultured on anti-mouse Ig-coated plates with the addition of anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) mAbs .

the down-regulation of CD28 expression .
The cross-linking of CD28 by itself did not affect the cell surface density of CD28 .
An analysis of « -/B-binding profiles of parallel cultures showed that cross-linking of CD3 alone or the simultaneous cross-linking of CD3 and CD28 resulted in significant reductions of a- and B-binding activities ( Fig .
6B ) .
In contrast , CD28 cross-linking alone did not affect & -/B-activities .
Modulation of CD28 expression during replicative senescence Loss of CD28 expression on T lymphocytes has been proposed to be a marker of replicative senescence ( 14 , 15 ) .
This is particularly relevant for CD8 * T cells , which show increased frequencies of CD28 `` `` `` cells in patients with chronic infections as well as during normal aging ( 32-38 ) .

cells within the CD4 compartment appears to be the exception rather than the rule ( 11 ) .
To explore the mechanism ( s ) of CD28 down-regulation during replicative senescence , CD4 * and CD8 * T cells were purified , activated with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb , and cultured in the presence of exogenous IL-2 .
Before in vitro activation , the percentage of CD28 `` `` `` cells in the purified CD4 * population was < 0.1 % .
During the culture period of 12 wk , there was a minimal emergence of CD4 *CD28 `` `` `` T cells accounting for 0.8 % of the total population .
In contrast , fresh CD8 * T cells contained between 33 % and 48 % CD28 `` `` `` T cells .
There was also a minimal increase in the frequencies of these cells by an average of FIGURE 7 .

However , this culture period was associated with a clear down-regulation of CD28 expression that was more pronounced on CD8 * T cells compared with that seen on CD4 * T cells .
A representative experiment is shown in Fig .
7A with purified CD4*CD28* and CD8 `` CD28 * T cells .
During the 12-week culture , CD28 expression on CD4 * cells declined from a mean fluorescence channel of 260 to 192 .
In CD8 * cells , CD28 expression declined within 4 wk with 48 % of the cells showing a CD28 `` phenotype .
By 12 wk , all CD8 T cells had a reduced CD28 expression ; the mean fluorescence channel had decreased from 225 to 55 .
Cultured CD4* and CD8 * T cells were analyzed for the site a-and -binding activities ( Fig .
7B ) .
In both cell types , there was a dissociated regulation of site - and -binding activities .
Although nuclear factors binding to site « were maintained in both cell types during the culture period , there was a characteristic pattern of loss in the site -binding activities .
As already shown in Fig .
3 , nuclear extracts from freshly isolated CD4*CD28* T cells showed two -bound complexes , a slow migrating B1 band , and a faster migrating B2 complex .
Cultured CD4 * cells showed a reduction or the complete loss of the slower migrating B1 band , whereas the faster migrating B2 band was maintained ( Fig .
7B ) .
Freshly isolated CD8 `` CD28 * T cells , on the other hand , already lacked the B1 band ( Fig .
3 ) that was lost in CD4 * T cells during the culture period .
The culture of CD8 * cells resulted in the further decline of the faster migrating B2 band .
This loss was already evident after 4 wk of culture , and a significant loss of binding activity was seen after 12 wk .
Discussion CD28 is the requisite costimulatory molecule in the generation of immune responses .
Although it is constitutively expressed on CD4 * T cells , CD28 may be entirely absent on functional T cells ( 11 , 12 , 39-41 ) .
Variations in the levels of its surface expression are thought to have a major impact on the fine-tuning of immune responses ( 1 , 6 , 13 , 42-45 ) .
Therefore , understanding the exact dynamics of CD28 regulation is of paramount importance .
In previous work ( 11 ) , we mapped two sequence motifs in the minimal CD28 gene promoter ( Fig .
1 ) that are occupied by two noncompeting nuclear factors .
Both motifs , site « and B , are located downstream from the TATA box .
The central contributions cpat cpst Number of events with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb ( OKT3 ) and exogenous IL-2 , and subsequently maintained for 12 wk .
At the indicated time points , parallel cultures were monitored for CD28 expression by flow cytometry ( A ) and B for o-/B-binding EMSAs ( B ) .
EMSAs were conducted with replicate binding reactions from two batches of nuclear extracts as depicted .
Data are representative of two independent experiments .

Moreover , a CD28 `` `` `` phenotype among CD4 * T cells is associated with the loss of binding activities of both motifs ( 11 ) .
The present study was designed to investigate how sites - and B-binding activities are involved in modulating CD28 expression , particularly under conditions known to affect levels of cell surface expression .
Data presented herein provide several lines of evidence showing that the dynamics of a- and -binding activities are predictive for different patterns of CD28 expression .
First , tissue specificity of site - and -bound nuclear factors is indicated by the presence of both nuclear factor complexes exclusively in lymphoid cells ( Figs .
2-4 , Table I ) .
Second , CD28 expression is directly correlated with the highly coordinated expression of site a- and -bound nuclear proteins ( Figs .
2-4 ) .
Finally , at least two distinct pathways for CD28 down-regulation are indicated by the differential binding activities of a and B sequences ( Figs .
5-7 ) .
These pathways occur at conditions known to modulate CD28 expression , i.e .
, the transient down-regulation of CD28 following T cell activation and the progressive reduction in CD28 expression that is characteristic of T cells during replicative senescence .
The notion that sites « and B play a role in CD28 expression derives from the data showing the congruence of specific motif-binding activities and CD28 expression ( Figs .
2 and 3 , Table I ) .
These activities are seen in both CD4 * and CD8 * T cells and in B cells that express CD28 .
As shown previously , the a- and -bound proteins represent two distinct molecules based on their differences in gel mobility and the lack of reciprocal competition the two sequence motifs ( 11 ) .
Preliminary studies on the isolation of the a- and -bound proteins reveal that they represent ~47-kDa and ~39-kDa molecules , respectively ( A. N. Vallejo et al .
, unpublished observations ) .
In contrast , various CD28 `` `` `` cells , including T cell lines and clones , lack any detectable « -/-binding activities .
The absence of both complexes in CD28 `` `` `` T cells indicates a strong correlation between the coordinate expression of both DNA-binding proteins and cell surface expression of CD28 .
This suggestion is consistent with data from point mutations in either the a or B motif that show the abrogation of transcriptional activity of the CD28 promoter ( 11 ) .
Data presented here also show that « -/B-bound complexes are found only in lymphoid tissues ( Fig .
4 ) , indicating that they are both gene- and tissue-specific .
This is a rather unexpected finding because it is not uncommon for nuclear factors , whether they are activators of transcription , scaffold/architectural proteins , or basal factors to be involved in the transcriptional control of different genes in various tissues .
Whether this exclusivity of site a- and -specific nuclear factors to lymphoid tissue is attributed to single motif-specific binding proteins or larger tissue-specific complexes remains to be examined .
Whereas the relative levels of site « -binding activities are equivalent in all CD28 * cells , there are distinguishable -binding pro-files .
CD4*CD28* T cells generally show two B-bound complexes ( B1 and B2 ) , CD28* B cells and CD8 * CD28* T cells show a single band , B2 ( Fig .
3 ) .
These results raise the possibility that there may be a differential requirement of the B complexes for CD28 transcription in CD4* and CD8 * T cells and in CD28 *-transformed B cells .
These differences in B-binding profiles however , did not correlate with CD28 cell surface expression .
Transformed B cells have extremely low levels of CD28 expression when compared with T cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
CD8 * and CD4 * T cells have equivalent cell surface densities of CD28 that are multifold higher compared to those seen on plasmacytoma cells .
6577 The significance of CD28 expression on B cells is not known , although it has been reported to be a feature of plasmacytomas , but not of primary B cells ( 46-48 ) .
In the present work , we also report that some , but not all , EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B cells express CD28 .
Some studies suggest that this may provide another survival advantage for immortalized or transformed B cells as indicated by the coexpression of CD80 , the counterreceptor for CD28 , on the same B cells ( 48 ) and its ability to generate a signaling cascade ( 49 ) .
Regardless of its function in B cells , the unusual expression of CD28 on these cells is associated with the acquisition of both a- and B-binding activities ( Figs .
2 and 3 , Table 1 ) .
The present data also show that the site « and B binding activities influence the fine-tuning of CD28 expression .
Activating stimuli induce a transient reduction in the levels of cell surface expression of CD28 accompanied by the coordinate down-regulation of a- and B-binding activities ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) .
Continuous culture of CD4 * T cells results in the modulation of B- but not -binding activities that is accompanied by a progressive decrease in the cell surface expression of CD28 ( Fig .
7A ) .
Down-regulation of CD28 expression following T cell activation is well documented ( 1 , 6 , 13 ) .
As demonstrated in Figs .
5 and 6 , the engagement of the TCR-CD3 complex , or mitogenic agents such as PMA/ionomycin induce significant reductions in the levels of CD28 cell surface expression .
These are accompanied by the down-regulation of both site a- and B-binding activities .
Cross-linking of CD28 alone did not affect CD28 expression or a-/B-activities , indicating that modulation of CD28 expression is directly influenced by activation signals emanating from the TCR-CD3 complex .
These data corroborate previous studies showing activation-induced down-modulation of CD28 gene promoter activity ( 11 ) .
They are also consistent with other studies demonstrating the rapid and selective reduction in the steady state levels of CD28 mRNA following activation ( 45 ) .
Collectively , these observations indicate the existence of a regulatory pathway that specifically targets the down-regulation of CD28 gene transcription .
The characteristic reduction in both a- and -binding activities following activation strongly support this hypothesis .
The functional impact of CD28 down-regulation in T cell-mediated responses remains to be explored .
However , receptor down-regulation of the TCR complex , CD4 , and CD8 have been reported ( 50-54 ) .
This is thought to effectively reduce the avidity of receptor-ligand inter-actions , resulting in the modulation of T cell effector functions .
Hence , variations in CD28 expression may influence the strength of the costimulatory signal that determines whether T cells undergo proliferation or anergy ( 1-10 ) .
Additionally , reduction in CD28 expression following activation has been shown to correlate with increased susceptibility to Fas-induced apoptosis ( 10 , 45 ) , indicating the importance of receptor modulation in maintaining T cell homeostasis .
While activation-induced down-regulation of CD28 expression equally affected CD4* and CD8 # * T cells , the gradual loss of CD28 expression during continuous culture was more pronounced in the CD8 * T cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
This type of cell culture has been proposed as a model of replicative senescence ( 14 , 15 , 55 ) and mimics the characteristic increase in the frequencies of CD8 ~CD28 `` `` `` T cells in vivo during aging or chronic infections ( 14 , 31-35 ) .
In support of this hypothesis , CD8 `` CD28 `` T cells have been shown to have significantly shorter telomeres compared with CD8 T cells ( 56 ) .
In contrast to CD8* T cells , T cells are infrequent and are found only in some elderly individuals and among RA patients ( 11 , 12 ) , suggesting that either CD8 * T cells have a higher turnover compared with 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 6578 CD4* T cells or that CD8 * T cells have a high propensity of losing CD28 expression .
Data presented here support the later hypothesis .
Continuous culture of CD4* and CD8 * T cells resulted in a more rapid decline in CD28 expression on CD8 * T cells than on CD4 * T cells ( Fig .
7A ) .
The reduction of €D28 expression on T cells during continuous culture is correlated with changes in the -binding profiles while the a profile is maintained ( Figs .
3 and 7B ) .
While freshly isolated T cells have two B-bound complexes , B1 and B2 , cultured CD4 `` CD28 * T cells lose the B1 but not the B2 complex .
In contrast , CD8 * T cells , which generally exhibit only the B2 complex , gradually lost this complex during continuous culture .
These results show that regulation of CD28 expression in CD4 * and CD8 * T cells can be distinguished by their B-binding profiles and that this difference may be related to the progressive loss of CD28 expression during replicative senescence in vitro .
Although the T cell culture system showed the down-regulation of CD28 , a complete loss of CD28 expression and the emergence of CD8 or CD4TCD28 `` `` `` T cells was not achieved .
This is in marked contrast with the in vivo situation where T cells completely lose the expression of CD28 , and CD28 `` ° `` T cells are not observed ( 11 , 32-36 ) .
As the data show , CD4 CD28 `` and CD8 T cells freshly isolated from peripheral blood lack both a- and B-bound complexes ( Fig .
3 ) ( 11 ) .
This is unlike in vitro replicative senescence wherein site B- but not site « -binding activity is down-modulated ( Fig .
7B ) .
In contrast , activation results in the down-regulation of both a- and -binding activities ( Fig .
6 ) .
Thus , we propose that continuous activation in vivo , rather than replicative immunosenescence , may account for the emergence of CD28 `` `` `` T cells .
CD4*CD28 `` `` `` T cells are highly oligoclonal ( 57 , 58 ) , suggesting that they may be derived from the chronic activation and proliferation of their CD28 progenitors .
This interpretation is supported by the isolation of T cell clones with identical TCR B-chain sequences in both CD28* and CD28 `` `` `` subsets ( 57 ) .
The loss of CD28 expression could be a mechanism to reestablish nonresponsiveness of a T cell under conditions of continuous antigenic stimulation .
This suggestion is consistent with the high frequencies of CD4 `` CD28 `` T cells in the chronic inflammatory disease RA ( 12 , 59 ) .
In summary , data presented here show that the dynamics of the binding profiles of the a and B sequence motifs in the CD28 gene promoter correlate with the patterns of expression of CD28 .
Both motif-specific binding activities are restricted to lymphoid tissues and are modulated by activating stimuli .
Under these conditions , a- and -bound complexes are coordinately expressed .
However , this coordinate expression is not maintained during in vitro replicative senescence .
Among CD8 * T cells , continuous culture induces the selective diminution of the B-protein complex with a concurrent decrease in the levels of cell surface expression of CD28 .
Changes in CD4* T cells are less pronounced with the selective loss of one of the two B-bound complexes accompanied by a slight , but significant , down-regulation of CD28 expression .
The complete loss of function in both motifs is correlated with a CD28 `` `` `` phenotype of both CD4* and CD8 * T cells in vivo .
Although both activation and replicative senescence modulate CD28 expression , further studies are needed to determine which mechanism leads to the CD28 `` `` `` endpoint phenotype observed in vivo .
Characterization of the molecular nature of the motif-specific complexes will be critical to our further understanding of the mechanisms involved in CD28 expression and its modulation during adaptive immune responses that led to the development of CD28 `` T cells .
