Milena Iacobelli , * Forest Rohwer , `` Paul Shanahan , Jose A. Quiroz , and Kathleen L. McGuire `` The IL-2 growth hormone is the major growth factor of activated T lymphocytes during a developing immune response .
IL-2 is required not only for cell cycle progression but also to protect Ag-activated T cells from programmed cell death .
In several cell types , activation of and/or activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) has been demonstrated to be extremely important in blocking apoptosis .
To determine whether either or both of these transcription factors are involved in cell survival or cell cycle progression in response to IL-2 , primary human T cells responsive to the growth factor were analyzed for NF-B and AP-1 activation .
The current study clearly demonstrates that IL-2 does not induce IxBa degradation or NF-xB activation in primary human T cells that respond to IL-2 by entering the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis .
Similarly , IL-2 neither activates JNK nor increases AP-1 binding activity to a consensus o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) response element .
On the other hand , the growth factor does induce the activation of STAT3 and STATS in these cells , as has been previously demonstrated .
These data show that neither NF-xB nor AP-1 activation is required for IL-2-mediated survival or cell cycle progression in activated primary human T cells .
The Journal of Immunology , 1999 , 162 ; 3308-3315. he IL-2 growth factor is produced upon antigenic stimulation of T cells and is vital to the cellular expansion required for a productive immune response ( for review , see Refs .
1-3 ) .
While a lack of IL-2 production results in the development of an unresponsive state in Ag-stimulated T cells ( for review , see Ref .
4 ) , IL-2 stimulation both induces cell cycle progression and inhibits programmed cell death in these cells .
Many studies have been performed to delineate the signal transduction pathways and later events that are responsible for the biological consequences of IL-2 stimulation on cell cycle progression and relief from apoptosis , but these events in primary human T cells are still incompletely understood .
It has been clearly demonstrated that the activation of NF- « B can protect several cell types from apoptotic death in response to various signals ( Refs .
5-9 ; for review , see Refs .
10 and 11 ) .
IL-2 , like other growth factors , inhibits apoptosis ( Ref .
12 ; for review , see Ref .
13 ) and has been shown to activate NF-KB ( 14 , 15 ) .
Therefore , it is logical to propose that the inhibition of cell death by IL-2 is mediated by NF-KB but it is not known whether this mechanism protects primary human T cells from the death that is a consequence of growth factor deprivation .

E-mail address : kmcguire @ sunstroke.sdsu.edu Copyright © 1999 by The American Association of Immunologists The AP-1 `` transcription factor has also been demonstrated to protect cells from apoptotic death ( 16 , 17 ) .
On the other hand , activation of the Jun N-terminal kinases , JNK1/2 , and AP-1 activity have also been shown to correlate with apoptotic cell death in many circumstances ( Refs .
18-22 ; for review , see Refs .
23 and 24 ) .
Both AP-1 binding activity ( 25 ) and JNK activation ( 26 , 27 ) have been reported to be the result of IL-2 stimulation in responsive cell lines , but it is unclear whether activation of AP-1 or JNK correlates with either the induction of apoptosis in IL-2-deprived primary human T cells or , conversely , the inhibition of apoptosis in IL-2-stimulated primary human T cells .
The current study was conducted to determine whether NF-KB and/or AP-1 activation is correlated with cell cycle progression or survival in primary human T cells responding to IL-2 .
As demonstrated here , neither of these transcription factors is activated by IL-2 in the primary human T cell populations analyzed .
In contrast , STAT proteins , previously demonstrated to be activated by IL-2 in responsive T cells ( 28-33 ) , are activated by IL-2 in these cells .
These data strongly suggest that neither AP-1 nor NF-KB activation is involved in cell cycle progression or the inhibition of apoptosis observed in primary human T cells in response to IL-2 .
Materials and Methods Cell culture Thymic blast cells were prepared as described previously ( 34 ) .
Briefly , thymocytes were isolated from human tissue by mincing and passage over a Ficoll gradient .
The isolated thymocytes were then stimulated with 5 ug/tal PHA ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) and 10 ng/ml PMA ( Sigma ) for 48 h. After stimulation , the cells were resuspended in complete medium ( RPMI 1640 ( Sigma ) , 10 % FBS ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) , -glutamate , and antibi-otics ) with 10 U/ml IL-2 ( Chiron , Emeryville , CA ) and fed each day for 3-6 days .
These cells are referred to as thymic blast cells ( TBCs ) .
Cells were deprived of IL-2 by washing twice and culturing in complete medium without IL-2 for the indicated times .

All TBC preparations were checked for responses to IL-2 using [ °H ] thymidine uptake , cell cycle progression , or STAT3 phosphorylation analysis .
PBMC were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation , cultured with PHA and PMA for 48 h , grown in IL-2 for 4 days , and then deprived of IL-2 for approximately 44 h , followed by restimulation for 4 h with 100 U/ml IL-2 , 10 ng/ml PMA , or PMA and 1.5 uM ionomycin .
The response of this population to IL-2 was verified by cell cycle analysis using propidium iodine staining as described below , and cell surface staining revealed that the cells were 97 % T cells ( CD3+* ) and approximately 50 % CD4* and 50 % CD8 * , and essentially 100 % expressed the IL-2R ae-chain .
These cells are referred to in the text as peripheral blood ( PB ) T cells .
Cell cycle analysis TBCs analyzed for cell cycle progression were deprived of IL-2 for 32 h or for 8 h followed by a 24-h restimulation with 100 U/ml IL-2 .
PB T cells were deprived of IL-2 for 44 h or for 16 h followed by a 28-h restimulation with IL-2 .
Cells were washed once with PBS and fixed by resuspension in PBS/ethanol ( 1/1 ) .
Before analysis , the fixed cells were resuspended into 100 pg/ml RNase A in PBS and incubated for 30-60 min at room temperature .
Propidium iodine ( 50 pg/ml ! )
was added , and the cells were analyzed on a FACScan ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) .
Analysis of the FACS data was performed using WINMIDLI , version 2.1.4 .
The percentage of cells in GyG ; , S , or G , +M was determined using the MultiCycle AV program from Phoenix Flow ( San Diego , CA ) .
TUNEL assay TBCs analyzed for apoptosis using the TUNEL technique were deprived of IL-2 for 32 h or for 8 h followed by a 24-h restimulation with IL-2 or PMA .
Cells were then harvested into polystyrene tubes ( previously precoated overnight at 4°C with 2 % FBS and BSA in PBS ) and fixed in 1 % para-formaldehyde in PBS .
The samples were washed once in PBS , resuspended in 70 % ethanol , and stored at -20°C .
Before FACS analysis , samples were washed with PBS and resuspended into elongation buffer ( 1X TdT buffer , 2.5 mM CoCl ; , 5 uM biotin-16-dUTP , and 10 U TdT ; Boehringer Mann-heim , Indianapolis , IN ) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min .
After elongation the cells were washed with PBS and resuspended into staining solution ( 5 X SSC , 5 % milk , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , and a 1/2000 dilution of FITC-avidin ( Sigma ) ) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature .
After staining , the cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5 % formaldehyde/PBS before analysis by FACS .
Western blot analysis Cells treated as indicated ( ~5 X 10 `` /condition ) were harvested into 300 mM NaCl , 100 mM Tris-Cl ( pH 7.0 ) , 2 % Triton X-100 , 2 % sodium de-oxycholate , and 0.2 % SDS containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors ( NaF and sodium orthovanadate at 25 pg/ml ; soybean trypsin inhibitor , leupeptin , aprotonin , and pepstatin A at 2 ug/ml ; and PMSF at 1 mM ) .
Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay system according to the manufacturer 's directions ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) , and proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitro-cellulose for Western blot analysis .
Equal loading was confirmed by Pon-ceau S staining of the filter after transfer .

Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antisera ( or anti-mouse antisera for total STATS ) and chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer 's directions ( New England Biolabs ) .
Stripping of blots for reprobing was performed in 62.5 mM Tris ( pH 6.7 ) , 2 % SDS , and 100 mM 2-ME for 30 min at 65°C .
Nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) Nuclear extracts were isolated as previously described ( 35 ) .
The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined as described above .
EMSAs were also performed essentially as previously described ( 35 ) .
Briefly , 5-10 ug of nuclear extract was incubated with 0.5-2 ug poly ( dI-dC ) in 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol , and 0.5 mM DTT at room temperature for 15 min .
Similarly , if applicable , 1 ug of antiserum specific for Re/NF- « B ( 0.6 ug for Bcl-3 ) or AP-1 family 3309 member proteins was added during this preincubation step .

°°P-labeled consensus TRE , NF-KB , or Oct probe ( 20,000 cpm ) was added , and the reaction was incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature .
The reactions were then electro-phoresed through 6.5 % ( Figs .
3 and 4 ) or 4 % ( Fig .
6 ) native acrylamide gels in 0.5 % TBE running buffer .
The gels were dried and exposed to XARS5 film .
The sequences of the probes used in this analysis were : NF- « B , 5'-gatecCAACGGCAGGGGAATCTCCCTCTCCTT ; TRE , 5'-gatc-CGGCTGACTCATCA ; and Oct , 5'-gatecTGTCGAATGCAAATCACTA GAA .
Results Growth factors are known to induce cell cycle progression and inhibit apoptosis in cells expressing the appropriate receptors .
To evaluate the activation of transcription factors that may be responsible for these biological responses in primary human T cells responding to IL-2 , cells were isolated from thymus tissue obtained from patients undergoing corrective cardiac surgery at Children 's Hospital in San Diego .
The cells were stimulated to express the high affinity IL-2R and then cultured in IL-2-containing medium for several days , resulting in a population of blast cells called TBCs .
The phenotype and IL-2 responsiveness of TBCs have previously been described in detail ( 34 ) .
These cells express high levels of CD3 , approximately two-thirds of the cells are single positive for CD4 or CD8 , one-third of the cells are double positive for both markers , and all cells express the IL-2R « -chain .
The high TCR/CD3 expression levels and the response of these cells to IL-2 strongly suggest that they represent the more mature cells found in the thymus rather than immature or developing T cells , which usually express low levels of the TCR/CD3 complex .
Culturing the cells in this manner allows for IL-2-dependent events to be studied independently of activation events that occur via the TCR .
The advantage of TBCs over PB T cells is that large numbers of cells can be obtained from a single thymus to study both cellular and molecular events in a single population .
Upon IL-2 withdrawal , about 90 % of TBCs synchronize in the G , /G , phase of the cell cycle within 32 h , and an average of 22 % are apoptotic ( Fig .
1 ) .
In contrast , when stimulated with IL-2 for 24 h , only about 65 % of TBCs are in G , , with 30 % in S phase , and only 11 % of the cells , on the average , are apoptotic .
As indicated above , the activation of NF- « B has been correlated with the inhibition of cell death in many cell types .
The activation of NF- « B is normally accomplished by the phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa , a protein that holds in the cytoplasm the p50/ReIA heterodimers that make up the active NF- « B transcription factor ( for review , see Refs .
36-38 ) .
Upon degradation of NF-KB is rapidly transported to the nucleus , where it is transcriptionally active .
To determine whether IL-2 activates NF- « B in TBCs , the fate of IxBa was analyzed in cells stimulated with IL-2 .
As can be seen in Fig .
2 , no significant degradation of IxBa was detected with IL-2 stimulation at any time point ana-lyzed , even several hours after stimulation .
In contrast , PMA induced a significant and sustained ( up to 4 h ) degradation of IxBa at concentrations well within those used normally in experimentation on primary human T cells .
IkB-a is only one of several IB proteins ( 36-38 ) , and mechanisms other than IxB degradation have been reported for the activation of NF-KB .
For instance , tyrosine phosphorylation of IkB-a leads to NF- « B release without degradation of the protein ( 39 ) .
To definitively determine whether NF- « B is present in nuclei of TBCs stimulated with IL-2 , NF- « B binding activity was analyzed .
TBCs were deprived of IL-2 to synchronize them and stimulated with IL-2 or PMA , and nuclear extracts were then isolated .
NF- « B binding activity was accessed by EMSA analysis using the 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3310 LACK OF NF- « B AND AP-1 ACTIVATION BY IL-2 CELL CYCLE APOPTOSIS o 480 & 6 Go/G1 90.3+/-4.6 % | ~ P 4000 | s se-m-aee |g| 22 .

IL-2 induces cell cycle progression and inhibits apoptosis in TBCs .
TBCs were prepared as described in the text and analyzed for DNA content using propidium iodide ( Zef ? )
and apoptosis using TUNEL ( righ ? )
.
The graphs shown are representative examples , and the numbers given are the average of 10 independent experiments with SDs indicated .
The rather large SDs obtained in the TUNEL assay are indicative of a variability between TBC preparations in the number of cells entering apoptosis 32 h after deprivation and not of the ability of IL-2 to induce cell survival .
The presence of IL-2 routinely ( 10/10 experiments ) reduces the level of apoptotic cell death observed .
consensus NF-KB binding site from the human IL-2R « -chain pro-moter .
As shown in Fig .
34 , TBCs deprived of IL-2 contained NF-KB binding activity , which consisted of p50 homodimers , but little RelA or c-Rel binding was observed .
IL-2 stimulation did not induce the formation of a new complex , nor did it appreciably increase RelA or c-Rel binding to this sequence over that observed in deprived cells .

- IxB-a is not degraded in IL-2-stimulated TBCs .
TBCs were deprived of IL-2 for 24 h and restimulated with IL-2 for the times indicated or with PMA at the concentrations indicated for 4 h , and total protein was analyzed for IxB-a levels using Western blot analysis .
The results shown are representative of two independent TBC preparations .
we also analyzed these complexes for increases in Bel-3 binding .
While Bcel-3 has been demonstrated to interact with and enhance the transcriptional activity of p50 homodimers ( 40-42 ) , no Bel-3 binding was detected in IL-2-stimulated cells using this assay .
PMA , on the other hand , decreased p50 homodimer formation and increased the formation of the two complexes containing p50 and RelA or c-Rel .
The PMA data indicate that NF- « B can be activated in TBCs .
Fig .
3B demonstrates that NF-KB ( RelA or c-Rel ) binding is not increased in TBCs stimulated from 30 min to 24 h with IL-2 .
Collectively , the data demonstrate that IL-2 does not activate NF- « B in cells that respond to the growth factor by progressing through the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis , suggesting that NF- « B activation does not play a role in these biological consequences of IL-2 stimulation in TBCs .
Previous studies have indicated that NF-KB is activated by IL-2 in freshly isolated PB T cells that have been treated with very high concentrations of IL-2 ( 14 ) .
Because TBCs are derived from thymic tissue , they may not be equivalent to mature PB T cells in their response to IL-2 .
Therefore , to determine whether the activation of mature T cells by IL-2 is similar to the activation of TBCs , PB T cells were isolated after culture in IL-2 for 4 days .
These culture conditions resulted in a population of pure ( > 95 % ) mature T cells that have been treated identically to TBCs .
These cells were washed , deprived , and then restimulated with IL-2 or PMA , and nuclear extracts isolated from these cells were evaluated for NF- « B binding activity .
As can be seen in Fig .
4 , PB T cells also did not activate novel NF-KB binding activity when responding to IL-2 despite the fact that they did respond to the growth factor by progressing through the cell cycle ( 46 % of cells are in S , G , , and M phases in the stimulated population 24 h after the addition of 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology 3311 A -IL-2 +IL-2 +PMA Ab : f_ p50 - RelA - cRel Bcl3 I - p50 RelA - cRel Bcl3 ” - _ pSO _ RelA - cRel BC|3| P , 1 ® S5 50/RelA # : “ u < PsQ/CRE i : wes < 4pS0 B IL-2 ( hr ) 0 .5 1 2 8 12 24 ork work hoo thats wou tout tart .

In contrast to what was seen with IL-2 , PMA stimulation enhanced the formation of complexes that contained p50 , RelA , and c-Rel ( Fig .
4 ) just as it did in TBCs .
These data suggest that mature T cells , like TBCs , do not activate NF- « B when responding to IL-2 .
The data shown above demonstrate that while PMA activates NF- « B in both TBCs and PB T cells , IL-2 does not .
To determine whether NF- « B activation can be correlated with an inhibition of apoptosis in these cells , the effect of PMA stimulation on the apoptosis seen in IL-2-deprived TBCs was analyzed .
As shown in Table I , TBCs deprived of IL-2 contained approximately 23 % apoptotic cells , and IL-2 stimulation decreased this number to approximately 10 % ( similar but independent results are shown in Fig .
1 ) .
Only 11 % apoptotic cells were observed when the cells were stimulated with PMA instead of IL-2 , suggesting that PMA -lL-2 pSO - RelA a F +IL-2 cRel Bcl3 _- p50 RelA Ab : ls wilh =t mycin brow cans With Lie __ _ CO r T is almost as effective as the growth factor at blocking apoptotic death .
Not surprisingly , PMA was not efficient at inducing cell cycle progression in these cells ( Table I ) .
Taken together , these data indicate that while the activation of NF- « B may correlate with an inhibition of apoptosis in these cells , it does not appear to be the mechanism employed by IL-2 .
The AP-1 transcription factor , i.e .
, a Fos/Jun heterodimer , has also been proposed to save many cell types from apoptotic death , although in contrast to NF-KB , activation of the Jun N-terminal kinases , JNKs , and c-Jun has also been proposed to induce apoptotic death in some cell types ( 16-22 ) .
Therefore , it is unclear whether the activation of AP-1 can be correlated with the inhibition of apoptosis or cell cycle progression in IL-2-stimulated cells .

threonine 183/tyrosine 185 was analyzed in TBCs stimulated with IL-2 .
As shown in Fig .
5 , significant phosphorylation of JNK in response to IL-2 was not observed in TBCs , suggesting that AP-1 can not be activated by IL-2 .
Anisomysin , a known activator of the SEK/JNK pathway , did induce JNK phosphorylation in TBCs , demonstrating that JNK can be activated in these cells .
In contrast , phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 , transcription factors known to be activated by IL-2 in both primary T cells and IL-2-responsive cell lines ( 28-33 ) , was readily observed in IL-2-stimulated TBCs .
To confirm that AP-1 is not activated by IL-2 in TBC 's , nuclear extracts were isolated from cells restimulated with IL-2 or PMA and ionomycin for the indicated times .
These extracts were analyzed for AP-1 binding activity to a consensus TRE sequence .
As shown in Fig .
6A , although a slight increase in TRE binding was observed with restimulation ( 1.5-fold when corrected for Oct binding activity ) , IL-2 did not induce in TBCs the formation of novel TRE-specific binding activity over that observed in cells deprived of IL-2 .
In addition , c-Fos was not present in the TRE-specific complex ( es ) observed , demonstrating that AP-1 was not present .

IL-2 stimulation of TBCs results in phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 , but not JNK 1/2 .
Total protein was isolated from TBCs deprived of IL-2 for 24 h and then restimulated with IL-2 or anisomysin for the times indicated .
Protein ( 50-75 pg/lane ) was loaded and probed for either phosphorylated JNK 1/2 or phosphorylated STAT3 and STATS using specific antisera .
Total protein levels were determined for all molecules by stripping and reprobing the filters with antisera recognizing both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of JNK1/2 , STAT3 , and STATS as applicable .
The results shown are representative of three independent TBC preparations .
LACK OF NF- « B AND AP-1 ACTIVATION BY IL-2 PMA and ionomycin , on the other hand , induced strong TRE bind-ing , which was due to AP-1 , as evidenced by the presence of c-Fos .
Similar results were obtained with PB T cells , in that PMA and ionomycin strongly induced TRE-specific binding activity , which includes c-Fos as a component of the complex ( Fig .
6B ) .
IL-2 , on the other hand , did not activate TRE binding in PB T cells over that observed in IL-2-deprived cells and did not induce c-Fos binding ( Fig .
6B ) .
These data along with the evidence that JNK is not activated strongly suggest that IL-2 does not use the AP-1 transcription factor to promote cell cycle progression or to inhibit apoptosis in primary human T cells .
Discussion Several studies have demonstrated that the NF- « B transcription factor is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis in many cell types ( 5-9 ; for review , see Refs .
10 and 11 ) .
Because IL-2 inhibits apoptosis in activated human T cells in addition to inducing cell cycle progression , it is logical to propose that activation of NF-kB occurs after IL-2 stimulation and that this mechanism is important to the inhibition of cell death .
In fact , previous studies have found that IL-2 does activate NF-KB in cell lines and in freshly isolated primary human T cells stimulated with very high levels of the factor ( 14 , 15 ) .
In addition , IL-2 is known to transcriptionally up-regulate the expression of the IL-2R « -chain gene , and it is known that the activation of this promoter by TCR/CD3 stimulation requires NF-KB .
However , it was recently discovered that the IL-2 response element in the IL-2R -chain promoter is a STATS binding site instead of the previously described NF- « B enhancer ( 43 , 44 ) .
Therefore , IL-2 does not need to activate NF-KB to up-regu-late this gene , and the data presented here demonstrate that IL-2 does not induce NF- « B binding activity in primary human T cells .
It is important to note that resting T cells , previously shown to activate NF- « B in response to high concentrations of IL-2 , are probably not the T cells responding to IL-2 in vivo , because they do not express the high affinity receptor .
In previously activated T cells that already express the high affinity receptor , activation of NF- « B by IL-2 does not appear to occur .
The data presented here clearly demonstrate that NF-KB activation is not obligatory in primary T cells that respond to IL-2 by both progressing through the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis .
The observation that PMA both activates NF- « B and inhibits apoptosis suggests that this transcription factor may block death in T cells .
In fact , several lines of evidence have supported the observation that NF-KB is activated when human T cells are stimulated through the Ag receptor , and it may be particularly important to survival signals in these cells in the thymus during development ( 45 , 46 ) .
These processes , however , do not appear to involve IL-2 and are probably not relevant to mature T cells proliferating solely in response to the growth factor .
It does appear that protection from apoptosis via the activation of NF-kB may be important in some cell lines that grow in response to IL-2 .
Because IL-2 does not inhibit apoptosis or induce cell cycle progression in primary human T cells via the activation of NF-KB , these observations suggest that IL-2R signaling pathways may be subverted in some immortalized cell lines .
These unnatural signaling pathways may be very important to the immortalization and/or transformation of the cells , but this subversion may provide misleading results in the study of IL-2R signaling when applied to the events that occur in normal T cells responding to the growth factor .
Previous studies have demonstrated that both c-fos and c-jun are up-regulated by IL-2 , leading to the obvious conclusion that AP-1 activity may be involved in the biologic consequences of IL-2 stimulation ( for review , see Ref .
3 ) .

The experiments shown are representative of four independent T cell preparations [ ( three thymic and one PB ) .
0 mus ct rt > > phosphatase calcineurin is required for the activation of JNK in T cells ( 47-49 ) , and IL-2 does not induce a Ca** flux ( 3 ) , it is logical to predict that JNK activation is not a consequence of IL-2 stimulation .
Indeed , it is shown here that JNK activation is not the result of IL-2 stimulation in primary human T cells , nor is AP-1 binding activity observed up to 8 h poststimulation .
However , JNK activation has been demonstrated to be the result of IL-2 stimulation in some factor-dependent T cell lines ( 27 ) .
Another study demonstrated that HTLV-1-transformed cells contain constitutively active JNK , but that IL-2-dependent cell lines immortalized by HTLV-1 infection do not contain active JNK in the absence of IL-2 ( 26 ) .
It was concluded from this latter study that IL-2 activates JNK in T cells and that the constitutive activation of JNK is an essential step in the development of the IL-2 independence required for transformation .
Because IL-2 does not activate JNK in primary cells , JNK activation by IL-2 may somehow be a consequence of the immortalization process these cell lines have under-gone , related to either HTLV-1 infection or the expression of the viral Tax protein in these cells .
Again , the data suggest that IL-2R signaling may be subverted in at least some cell lines responding to the growth factor .
This observation requires that caution be used when inferring that results obtained with these cells can be applied to nontransformed human T cells .
It is still unclear what mechanisms are responsible for cell cycle progression and the inhibition of apoptosis in human T cells responding to IL-2 .
Previous studies , such as those discussed above , demonstrating the activation of transcription factors to be protective against apoptosis strongly suggest that transcription is required for the inhibition of cell death in response to IL-2 .
By ruling out the involvement of NF-KB and AP-1 in the biological consequences of IL-2 stimulation , other transcription factors may now become the focus of investigation .
It has been shown that the E2F transcription factor is activated by IL-2 and that this is mediated by phosphoinositol 3-kinase ( PI-3K ) ( 50 ) , a kinase well established to be activated by the growth factor ( 3 ) .
PI-3K is known to activate the MEK/ERK ( mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-reg-ulated kinase ( ERK ) kinase ) pathway in T cells responding to IL-2 ( 51 ) , but it also activates AKT/PKB ( protein kinase B ) in many cell types tested ( for review , see Refs .
52 and 53 ) , and this kinase has been implicated in both cell cycle progression and the inhibition of apoptosis in cells responding to IL-2 ( 54 ) .
E2F activation requires AKT , but not ERK , and correlates well with cell cycle progression in cells responding to IL-2 , although it is not sufficient in and of itself to induce proliferation ( 50 ) .
Whether E2F or , al-ternatively , the activation of other transcription factors that might be induced by AKT are involved in the inhibition of apoptosis mediated by IL-2 is not yet known .
As noted above , the JAK/STAT pathway is also stimulated by IL-2 ( 28 , 30-33 , 55-58 ) .
Both STAT3 and STATS are known to be activated by IL-2 , and indeed , the activation of these STAT 's is readily observable in TBC 's ( Fig .
5 ) .
Zamorano et al .
( 59 ) recently reported that STATS is required for protection from apoptosis but not for cell cycle progression in 32D cells expressing the IL-2R .
Additional studies have suggested that STAT 's are not required for proliferation induced by IL-2 ( 31 , 60 ) , but T cells from STAT-5A-deficient mice have a proliferative defect ( 44 ) .
STATS is required for IL-2-mediated IL-2Ra expression ( 43 , 44 ) , but decreased high affinity receptor expression may not be entirely 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 3314 responsible for the decrease in proliferation observed in STAT5A-deficient mice ( 61 ) .
These data demonstrate that studies in primary mouse T cells may not always agree with what has been observed in immortalized murine cell lines , and it will be interesting to determine what else STAT-deficient mice will reveal about IL-2R signaling mechanisms .
Further studies are required to determine whether STAT proteins are included among the transcription factors that are important for IL-2-mediated cell cycle progression or inhibition of apoptosis in primary human T cells .
Either way , NF- « B and AP-1 are not activated by IL-2 in these cells , suggesting that other transcription factors must be involved in these events in primary human T cells responding to IL-2 .
