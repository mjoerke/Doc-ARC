We have previously shown that after a mutation of Leu , , to Arg the DNA binding basic domain of MyoD confers c-myc-like functional characteristics to the protein .
In this study we used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to determine whether such mutations occur naturally in rhabdomyosarcomas .
We have found that the basic domains of all the myogenic factors remain unaltered in rhabdomyosarcomas .
Selection against such mutations may be the result of functional redundancy of these myogenic transcription factors .

Key words : myogenic proteins « myoD « SSCP « c-myc » muscle differentiation Introduction MyoD , myogenin , myf5 , and myf6 are a group of muscle-spe-cific , `` basic helix-loop-helix `` ( bHLH ) !
transcription factors that regulate skeletal myogenesis ( 1-3 ) .
These proteins bind to the promoters of many muscle-specific genes at sites containing the canonical `` E-box `` sequence CANNTG .
After binding , other domains within these myogenic factors activate transcription of the adjacent gene ( 4-7 ) .
Although some differences have been noted in the various properties of these factors and in their expression during embryogenesis ( 8-10 ) , each one by itself is fully capable of inducing myogenic differentiation when expressed ectopically in nonmyogenic cells such as fibroblasts ( 11 ) .
This suggests that MyoD , myogenin , myf5 , and myf6 are components of a redundant cellular mechanism for ensuring the proper timing and progression of skeletal muscle morphogenesis .
This concept has gained support from recent experiments demonstrating that skeletal muscle development Address correspondence to Dr. Edward V. Prochownik , Division of Hematology /Oncology , Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh , 3705 Fifth Avenue at DeSoto , Pittsburgh , PA 15213 .

© The American Society for Clinical Investigation , Inc. 0021-97 - $ 2.00 Volume 93 , January 1994 , 5-9 in mice lacking functional copies of MyoD or myf5 proceeds relatively normally ( 12 , 13 ) .
DNA binding by the myogenic bHLH proteins requires that they first dimerize .
However , such DNA binding by homo-dimers , while specific , is relatively weak ( 14 ) .
Binding is significantly enhanced by heterodimeric association with the ubiquitously expressed products of the E2A gene product ( E12 and E47 ) and , indeed , the active transcriptional complexes in myogenic cells appear to consist of such heterodimers ( 14 ) .
In the case of MyoD , for example , each component of the hetero-dimer is thought to contribute a DNA half-site recognition specificity such that the optimal binding site ( CACCTG ) is a composite of the preferred binding sites of the individual components in homodimeric form ( 15 ) .
myc family proteins are also members of the bHLH family and bind the E-box motif CACGTG in association with the recently described protein max ( 16 , 17 ) .
Myogenic differentiation is accompanied by c-myc downregulation and enforced c-myc expression inhibits the differentiation process ( 18 , 19 ) .
The myogenic proteins and c-myc can thus be viewed as components of opposing regulatory pathways in which MyoD and its homologues drive the differentiation process and exert an anti-proliferative effect ( 20 ) whereas c-myc inhibits myogenic differentiation and drives proliferation ( 21 ) .
The myogenic and myc family member bHLH proteins contain related DNA binding basic domains ( Fig .
1 ) .
In particular , MyoD and c-myc are identical at 5 of the 14 amino acids that comprise this motif .
Recently , we reported that substitution of the myogenically highly conserved Leu , ; in MyoD with the similarly conserved Arg residue present in myc and max family members imparts novel properties to MyoD ( 22 ) .
Although the mutant protein retained the ability to bind to a consensus MyoD site , it was unable to transactivate a promoter containing this site and actually competed with wild-type MyoD in this regard .
Furthermore , the mutant MyoD protein gained the capacity to recognize a c-myc/ max binding site and , like c-myc , correctly downregulated a gene containing such a site .
The acquisition of these unexpected properties by the mutant MyoD protein suggested a novel means by which skeletal muscle tumors ( rhabdomyosarcomas ) might arise .
Point mutation of the highly conserved Leu , ; ; , codon ( CTG ) of MyoD to that encoding an arginine ( CGG ) found at the analogous position of the c-myc basic domain would result , on the one hand , in a dominant-negative form of the protein that would compete with wild-type myogenic factors and block their transactivation of target genes in myoblasts .
On the other hand mutant MyoD could substitute for authentic c-myc protein , which would be downregulated in cells undergoing terminal myogenic commitment .
c-myc target genes might therefore continue to be regulated normally resulting in a sustained prolifera- Basic Domain of Myogenic Factors in Rhabdomyosarcoma 5 tive signal .
This combination of inhibited differentiation and enhanced proliferation , mediated either by mutant MyoD protein or other similarly mutant myogenic factors , might initiate or contribute to the neoplastic phenotype .
To test this idea , we have surveyed 19 primary rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and 14 rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines for evidence of mutation in the basic domains of any of the four known myogenic proteins .
We used PCR to amplify the DNA binding domains of each of the four known myogenic factors and subjected these to single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis to detect point mutations .
SSCP has proven to be a highly sensitive and reliable means of detecting such mutations in a variety of genes ( 23-25 ) .
In our survey we have not detected any differences in the electrophoretic mobility of the fragments obtained from the various tumors or cell lines .
These results suggest that the generation of rhabdomyosarcomas is not commonly associated with the acquisition of mutations in the DNA binding domains of any of the known myogenic factors .
Other molecular events are more likely to contribute to the sustained proliferative capacity and loss of differentiated phenotype of these highly aggressive childhood tumors .
Methods Tumor tissue samples .
19 primary tumors ( 13 embryonal , 6 alveolar ) and the following 14 cell lines ( 7 embryonal , 6 alveolar , 1 undifferen-tiated ) were studied : Rh1 , Rh3 , Rh4 , Rh5 , Rh18 , Rh30 , SA2 , AD2 , Rh28 , NIH , A673 , A204 , TC206C , and MCRB-1 ( 26-29 ) .
Histopatho-logical classification was in accord with the guidelines proposed by Patton and Horn ( 30 ) .
Tumor tissue samples were collected from surgical specimens and snap frozen and stored under liquid nitrogen until further processing .
Peripheral leukocytes were obtained from 10 healthy volunteers and separated from other blood components by Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation .
Genomic DNA was isolated from these tissues by standard procedures ( 31 ) .
Primers for PCR amplification .
The forward primers used to specifically amplify MyoD , myogenin , myf5 , and myf6 , respectively , and the lengths of the fragments amplified are as follows : Myo D , * `` CTGTGG-GCCTGCAAGGCGTGCAAG** : 167 bp ; myogenin , GCCGGA-TCC* `` *TGTAAGAGGAAGTCGGTGTCCGTG®* ' : 154 bp ; Myf , GCCGGATCC*®AAGAGGAAGTCCACCACCATG** : 157 bp ; Myfé6 , GCCGGATCC*°AAGAGAAAATCTGCCCCCACTG** : 156 bp .
In the case of myogenin , myf5 , and myf6 , BamHI sites and `` G-C `` clamps were added to the forward primers to facilitate cloning .
The following reverse PCR primer was chosen for all four myogenic genes that bear identical sequences at this site : 5° GCCAAGCTT CACCTT-GGGCAACCGCTGGTTTGG .
A HindIII site and `` G-C `` clamp were added to the reverse primer .
The following primers were used to amplify a 159-bp fragment containing the murine MyoD basic domain from plasmid DNAs : Fwd : ***CTGTGGGCCRFCAAGGCGTGCAAG ; Rev : CCGAACCAG-CGGCTACCCAAGGTG®** .
PCR amplification and fragment isolation .
For plasmid DNA amplification , we chose several MyoD cDNAs in which we had previously introduced specific point mutations in the DNA binding basic domains ( 22 ) .
These were used to establish that the conditions chosen for SSCP analysis could distinguish among these various mutants and the wild-type MyoD cDNA sequence .
The specific MyoD plasmid DNAs chosen contained the following mutations : mutant 3 : Ala ; , , » Thr ; Mutant 6 : Met , , > » Val ; Mutant 7 : Arg , , , - » Leu ; Mutant 9 : Leyu ; ; ; -+ » Arg .
For genomic DNA amplification , the PCR mixture contained 500 ng of genomic DNA , 1 pg of each primer , 3.75 mM MgCl , ( for myogenin and MyoD ) or 1.5 mM MgCl , ( for myf5 and myf6 ) , 1:10 reaction volume of magnesium-free 1I0X PCR buffer ( Promega Biotec , 6 G. Anand , D. N. Shapiro , P. S. Dickman , and E. V. Prochownik Madison , WI } , 4 mM each of dNTP , 5 uCi of a- [ P ] JG @ CTP ( sp act , > 3.000 Ci/mmol ; Amersham , Arlington , IL ) , and 0.5 U of Taq poly-merase in a 25-4l reaction volume .
Amplification was performed for 40 cycles with denaturation at 94°C , annealing at 58°C , and extension at 72°C for 1 min each .
Similar conditions were used to amplify MyoD cDNA sequences except that the PCRs contained 100 pg of the appropriate linearized plasmid DNA .
Specific bands were excised from a 5 % acrylamide gel , incubated in an elution buffer containing 0.5 M ammo-nium acetate , 0.01 M magnesium acetate , | mM EDTA , and 0.1 % SDS overnight , extracted with phenol /chloroform/ isoamyl alcohol , precipitated with ethanol , and resuspended in 20 ul of distilled water .
The eluted fragments migrated as single bands upon reelectrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide or agarose gels ( not shown ) .
That the PCR product obtained derived from the appropriate gene was confirmed by restriction mapping and , in select cases , DNA sequencing ( not shown ) .
SSCP analysis .
SSCP analysis was performed essentially as described ( 23 ) .
Approximately 10,000 cpm of the purified PCR fragment ( 1 ul ) was mixed with 9 ul of a loading dye ( 20 mM EDTA , 0.1 % SDS , 95 % formamide , 0.04 % xylene cyanol , 0.04 % bromophenol blue ) , boiled for 5 min , and quick chilled on ice .
2.5 ul was loaded on a 5 % acrylamide gel containing 6.25 % glycerol and electropheresis was carried out at 4°C for 4 h at 35 mA .
The gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film for 16 h at - 80°C in the presence of an intensifying screen .
Results and Discussion To first establish that the conditions chosen for SSCP analysis could distinguish a mutant gene from the wild type , we used several plasmids that encoded either a wild-type murine MyoD cDNA or the same cDNA with individual point mutations deliberately engineered into the DNA binding basic domain ( 22 ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
In all cases tested , DNA fragments containing point mutations were readily distinguishable from the wild-type sequence and from one another after SSCP analysis .
We conclude from these experiments that SSCP analysis provides a sensitive and reliable means of detecting point mutation in the MyoD basic domain .
We next analyzed genomic DNA samples obtained from 33 rhabdomyosarcomas ( 19 primary tumors and 14 cell lines ) and from the peripheral leukocytes of 10 normal individuals .

Mobility shift analysis of murine MyoD mutants .
DNA fragments encoding the basic domain of MyoD from wild-type and mutants 3 , 6 , 7 , and 9 ( 22 ) were analyzed for SSCP as described in Methods .
Each mutant fragment migrated with a characteristic | __ pattern different from that of the wild type .
3 , & PCR was performed using primers specific for MyoD , myogen-ein , myf5 , and myf6 .
Specific amplified bands were obtained in all cases and were subsequently purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before being subjected to SSCP analysis .
The myogenic gene of origin of the amplified fragment was confirmed by establishing the presence of predicted restriction en-donuclease sites or by DNA sequencing of selected cloned fragments ( not shown ) .
Under our experimental conditions , the patterns of DNA strand migration were identical for fragments obtained from either normal or tumor DNAs , suggesting identical DNA sequences in the basic domains ( Fig .
3 ) .
In the case of myogenin this was confirmed by cloning and sequencing several of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments obtained from tumor DNAs .
In all cases , the DNA sequences of the basic Normal @ | Tumors | domains corresponded to the previously published sequence ( 32-34 ) .
In particular , we found no evidence of mutation at the highly conserved Leu that corresponds to Leu ; ; , of MyoD .
Thus , we can conclude from this study that mutation within the DNA binding domain of none of the four myogenic factors discussed here is commonly associated with the occurrence of rhabdomyosarcomas .
We and others have provided evidence that Arg ; , , of c-myc is a critical determinant of inner dinucleotide ( CG ) binding specificity in the c-myc E-box recognition site , CACGTG ( 35 , 36 ) .
This amino acid , highly conserved among myec/max family members , corresponds to the equally well-conserved leucine residue of the four myogenic factors ( Leu ; ; , in MyoD ) , which , by analogy , would be important in the recognition of the CC inner dinucleotide sequence in the MyoD binding site ( CACCTG ) by the MyoD-E12/E47 heterodimer .
Given the importance of these basic domain residues to DNA binding and , in particular , to the profound functional consequences of mutation at these sites ( 35 ) , how might we explain why they are not mutated in rhabdomyosarcomas ?
Perhaps the simplest explanation lies in the redundancy of the myogenic pathway .
Assuming that a mutation such as the MyoD Leu ; ; , - » Arg did occur , it is quite conceivable that its effects would be negligible due to its competition for binding sites , not only with wild-type MyoD encoded by the unmutated allele but with the other myogenic factors as well .
Similarly , despite the progressive decline of c-myc protein levels in differentiating cells , c-myc binding sites might continue to be occupied by max homodimers that bind with quite high affinity to these sites ( 37 , 38 ) .
Other bHLH proteins , such as the upstream stimulatory factor ( 39 ) , and other more recently described max dimerization partners , such as mad and mxi ( 40 , 41 ) , would also be expected to compete with mutant MyoD proteins for these sites as well .
Under such conditions basic region mutations of any individual myogenic protein might not be subject to the selective pressures necessary for the genesis of a rhabdomyosarcoma .
Thus , one additional beneficial consequence of bHLH family redundancy might be to guard against the full consequences of such deleterious mutations .

There appears to be no difference in the migratory pattern between the normal and tumor DNA for all the genes analyzed .
Basic Domain of Myogenic Factors in Rhabdomyosarcoma 7 At least two additional factors might conspire against the selection of `` activating `` mutations within the basic regions of myogenic genes .
One of these is the apparent absence in rhabdomyosarcomas of one or more accessory molecules necessary for the function of the MyoD transactivation domain ( 42 ) .
The lack of a myogenically conducive environment might explain why neither endogenous myogenic proteins , commonly expressed in rhabdomyosarcomas , nor those driven by trans-fected expression vectors , significantly alter the transformed phenotype of such tumors ( 43 ) .
The second factor that might select against the generation of activating mutations is the nature of the transactivating domains of the myogenic proteins themselves .
Although the MyoD Leu ; ; , > » Arg mutation does indeed mimic c-myc in terms of its ability to regulate a c-myc-responsive gene , this effect is unlikely to be universal .
Other accessory proteins that interact specifically with the c-myc transactivation domain may be essential for the proper regulation of target genes involved in the transformation pathway .
Mutant myogenic proteins with the capacity to bind c-myc sites might not necessarily interact with the accessory factors required for subsequent transcriptional control of all c-myc regulated genes .
Consistent with this notion is the inability of the mutant MyoD protein to transform susceptible rat embryo cells in conjunction with an activated ras oncogene ( our unpublished observations ) .
In summary , we have demonstrated that mutations in the DNA binding domains of four myogenic proteins do not occur with any appreciable frequency in rhabdomyosarcomas .
Such mutations may be selected against as a result of the redundancy of the myogenic and c-myc pathways , an intracellular environment that prevents the proper function of the transcriptional activation domains of the myogenic proteins , or lack of binding of accessory proteins necessary for the proper regulation of c-myc-responsive genes .
