JOHNSTON'* DNAX Research Institute , Palo Alto , California 94304 , and Institute of Life Science , Kurume University , 2432-3 Aikawa-machi , Kurume , 839-0861 Japan `` Received 7 January 1999/Returned for modification 4 March 1999/Accepted 15 April 1999 Members of the recently discovered SOCS/CIS/SSI family have been proposed as regulators of cytokine signaling , and while targets and mechanisms have been suggested for some family members , the precise role of these proteins remains to be defined .
To date no SOCS proteins have been specifically implicated in interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) signaling in T cells .
Here we report SOCS-3 expression in response to IL-2 in both T-cell lines and human peripheral blood lymphocytes .
SOCS-3 protein was detectable as early as 30 min following IL-2 stimulation , while CIS was seen only at low levels after 2 h. Unlike CIS , SOCS-3 was rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-2 .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 was observed upon coexpression with Jak1 and Jak2 but only weakly with Jak3 .
In these experiments , SOCS-3 associated with Jakl and inhibited Jak1 phosphorylation , and this inhibition was markedly enhanced by the presence of IL-2 receptor beta chain ( IL-2RB ) .
Moreover , following IL-2 stimulation of T cells , SOCS-3 was able to interact with the IL-2 receptor complex , and in particular tyrosine phosphorylated Jak1 and IL-2Rf .
Additionally , in lymphocytes expressing SOCS-3 but not CIS , IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 5b was markedly reduced , while there was only a weak effect on IL-3-mediated STAT Sb tyrosine phosphorylation .
Finally , proliferation induced by both IL-2- and IL-3 was significantly inhibited in the presence of SOCS-3 .
The findings suggest that when SOCS-3 is rapidly induced by IL-2 in T cells , it acts to inhibit IL-2 responses in a classical negative feedback loop .
T-lymphocyte proliferation , a crucial component of immune responses , is controlled by a number of cytokines , in particular interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) .
IL-2 signals via a receptor composed of three chains IL-Z2Ra , IL-2R $ , and y , , ( the common y chain , shared by the receptors for IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , and IL-15 ) ( 22 ) .
These receptor components have no intrinsic kinase activity but when stimulated dimerize and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrate ( s ) via the receptor-asso-ciated Janus kinases ( Jaks ) .
Binding of IL-2 to its receptor results in activation of Jak1 and Jak3 , which in turn induce phosphorylation of associated signaling molecules including the STAT 's ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) , leading to the expression of target genes ( see reference 11a for a review ) .
While these signaling responses have been well character-ized , how they are controlled is not clear .
A number of cytokines ( notably IL-2 , IL-3 , and erythropoietin [ EPO ] ) have been shown to recruit the inhibitory tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 ( 19 ) .
More recently , the cytokine-inducible gene CIS ( for cytokine-induced SH2 [ Sre homology 2 ] protein ) was shown to associate with the IL-3 and EPO receptors ( IL-3R and EPOR ) ( 29 ) and later shown to inhibit signaling through these receptors in an apparent classical negative feedback loop ( 13 ) .
Sub-sequently , SOCS-1/JAB/SSI-1 was shown to inhibit IL-6-in-duced macrophage differentiation of M1 cells and to bind to Jak2 and inhibit signaling through it .
A number of cytokine-inducible genes that along with CIS and SOCS-1 encode a family of proteins that can modulate cytokine signaling variably called SOCS ( suppressors of cytokine signalling ) ( 26 ) , or * Corresponding author .

4980 CIS ( 7 ) , or SSI ( STAT -induced STAT inhibitors ) ( 17 ) have now been cloned .
SOCS proteins are characterized by a central SH2 domain and a unique motif in their C-terminal region which has been designated a SOCS box ( or CIS homology domain ) .
The SH2 domain , while enabling interaction with phosphorylated proteins involved in signal transduction and cell activation , has been shown at least in the case of CIS and SOCS-1 to be insufficient to inhibit cytokine signaling ( 7 , 18 ) .
The SOCS box is found in a number of other families of proteins in association with other motifs ( WD40 repeats , ankyrin repeats , Spry domains , and GTPase domains ) ( 10 , 12 , 20 ) .
SOCS-3 mRNA has been detected in various tissues in response to a number of cytokines , including IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-6 , leukemia-inhibitory factor ( LIF ) ( 10 , 26 ) , growth hormone ( GH ) ( 1 ) , and leptin ( 3 ) .
Preliminary data has suggested that SOCS-3 may play a role in inhibitory responses to LIF ( 12 , 14 ) , GH ( 1 ) , and leptin ( 3 ) .
In vivo northern analyses have shown induction of SOCS-3 in spleen and thymus , but the expression and modulation of the SOCS-3 protein in lymphocytes have not been examined .
In this report , we show that SOCS-3 protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation are highly regulated by IL-2 in T cells .
Significantly , we have found that SOCS-3 can associate with components of the IL-2R complex , specifically Jak1 ( but not Jak3 ) , and IL-2RB .
We further show that SOCS-3 can inhibit Jak1 phosphorylation , that this is accentuated by the presence of IL-2RB , and that expression of SOCS-3 can inhibit IL-2 responses .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies .
Polyclonal rabbit anti-CIS antiserum was previously described ( 29 ) .
Polyclonal rabbit anti-SOCS-3 antiserum was generated by using amino acids 5 to 21 of human SOCS-3 protein .
Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) 9E10 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , Calif. ) , anti Vor .
19 , 1999 FLAG MAb M2 was purchased from Eastman Kodak ( Rochester , N.Y. ) , antiphosphotyrosine MAb 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology , Inc. ( Lake Placid , N.Y. ) .
Polyclonal rabbit anti-Jak3 and anti-STAT5b antisera were generous gifts of J. O'Shea ( National Institutes of Health ) .
Jakl MAb was obtained from Transduction Laboratories ( Lexington , Ky. ) .
MAb 561 was used for immunoprecipitation of IL-2RB as described previously ( 11 ) ; antisera to IL-2RB ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and IL-3RB , , ( Upstate Biotechnology ) were used for Western blotting .
A MAb was used for immunoblotting Jak1 ( Trans-duction Laboratories ) .
Constructs .
The full-length human SOCS-3 and SOCS-2 cDNAs were generated by PCR from a human T-cell library and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pME18S ( in which expression is driven by the SRa promoter [ 27 ] ) .
Human recombinant SOCS-3 ( hrSOCS-3 ) , hrSOCS-2 , murine recombinant Jak1 , and hrJak3 cDNA were generated by PCR and subcloned into pME18S with a single copy of the FLAG sequence at their carboxy termini ( 4 ) .
IL-2RB and IL-2Ry cDNAs were also cloned into pME18S .
A previously described ( 7 , 29 ) SOCS-1/JAB construct was also used .
Cells and transfections .
Peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) were prepared from normal donors by using standard protocols and stimulated for 72 h in Yessel 's medium supplemented with 10 % human serum , 2 mM glutamine , 100 U of penicillin and 100 U of streptomycin per ml , and 2 mg of phytohemagglutinin ( PHA-L ; Boehringer Mannheim ) per ml .
They were then washed and rested for 12 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 % human serum without PHA or IL-2 .
YT cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 2 mM glutamine , and 100 U of penicillin and 100 U of streptomycin per ml .
The IL-2-dependent T-cell lines HT-2 and Kit-225 were grown as described above in medium containing 50 U of IL-2 per ml .
Cytokine-dependent cells were rested in RPMI 1640 medium-2 % FBS for 4 to 12 h prior to cytokine stimulation .
BaF3 transfectants ( maintained in IL-3 [ 10 ng/ml ) ) expressing IL-2RB and SOCS-3 were generated by electroporation ( 4 X 10° cells/ml ) with plasmids containing IL-2R $ B , using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser ( 260 V , 960 mF ) , and were selected in neomycin ( 2 mg/ml ; Gibco BRL ) or puromycin ( 200 pg/ml ; Bio-Rad ) .
Resistant clones were tested for IL-2RB and SOCS-3 expression by Western blotting using IL-2RB antiserum ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) or antiserum generated to the amino terminus of SOCS-3 .
Ba/F3 cells expressing the tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator protein were generated by electroporation with pUHD15-1 modified to contain a puromycin resistance gene ( 15 ) .
This clone was transfected with pUHD10-3 containing SOCS-3 by electroporation as described above and selected by using 1.2 mg of hygromycin per ml .
Tetracycline ( 1 g/ml ) was replaced every 48 h ; to induce expression of SOCS-3 , cells were grown in the absence of tetracycline for 36 h. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium medium with 10 % FBS , 2 mM glutamine , and 100 U of penicillin and streptomycin per ml and transfected at 40 to 50 % confluency , using calcium phosphate precipitation reagents by standard protocols ( 5'-3 ' , Inc. , Boulder , Colo. ) ; cells were harvested at 36 to 48 h. To test cytokine responses , cells were stimulated with IL-2 ( 50 U/ml ) , IL-3 ( 10 ng/ml ) , IL-4 ( 100 U/ml ) , IL-10 ( 100 U/ml ) , or gamma interferon ( 50 U/ml ) .
RNA preparation and Northern blot analyses .
Using an RNeasy midi kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , Calif. ) , we extracted total RNA from PBL s or cell lines either treated with cytokine or untreated and quantitated RNA by spectrophotometry .
Then 20 ug of total RNA from each sample was subjected to electrophoresis overnight in a 1 % agarose formaldehyde gel .
Gels were washed three times with water and then denatured for 30 min in 50 mM NaOH-10 mM NaCl , rinsed with 100 mM Tris HCI ( pH 7.5 ) for 30 min , and finally placed in 10 % SSC ( 1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate ) for 30 min .
Gels were transferred overnight onto nylon membranes ( Schleicher & Schleicher , Keene , NH . )
that had been pretreated with water and then 10 % SSC .
Following transfer , membranes were rinsed with 2 % SSC and cross-linked in a UV Stratalinker 2400 ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif. ) .
Membranes were prehybridized in 5 ml of Rapid-hyb ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , III . )
and then hybridized with cDNAs labeled by random priming using the Rediprime DNA labeling system ( Amer-sham ) .
Following hybridization , membranes were subjected to a final wash in 0.1 % SSC-0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) at 65°C .
Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting .
Following treatment , cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline lysed in Brij 97 lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 7.5 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mM Na ; VO , , 5 mM NaF , 10 mg each of leupeptin and aprotonin per m1 ) , and centrifuged at 18,000 X g at 4°C for 15 min .
Lysates were immunoblotted as described below or immunoprecipitated by incubating with one of the antibodies described above bound to protein A-agarose beads or with a SOCS-3-glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose , for 2 to 4 h at 4°C .
Lysates and immunoprecipitates were washed , boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer , resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels ( Novex , San Diego , Calif. ) , and transferred onto Im-mobilon membranes ( Millipore ) .
Immunoblotting was performed with antibodies as described above , and blots were visualized by enhanced chemilumines-cence ( Pierce , Rockford , III . )
.
In vitro kinase assays .
Following immunoprecipitation as described above , precipitates were washed twice with MSH buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM HEPES ) and then incubated for 15 min with kinase reaction buffer ( 20 mM Tris [ pH 7.5 ] , 5 mM MgCl , , 5 mM MnCl , 1 wM ATP ) containing 10 wCi of [ y-*°P ] ATP on ice .
After two washes with MSH buffer , samples were boiled in THE SOCS-3 PHOSPHOPROTEIN REGULATES IL-2 RESPONSES - 4981 reducing SDS buffer , and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) , and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography .
Thymidine incorporation assay .
Cells from two BaF3 clones inducibly expressing SOCS-3 were rested in cytokine-free medium as described above , with half the cells first being removed from tetracycline for 24 h. Cells ( 4 x 10° per well ) were plated in a 96-well plate in RPMI 1640 medium-5 % FBS , with or without tetracycline ( 1 pg/ml ) and with no cytokine or 50 U of IL-2 per ml .
After 20 h , [ °H ] thymidine ( 1 mCi/ml ) was added for 4 h , cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters , and incorporated [ °H ] thymidine was quantitated as described elsewhere ( 15 ) .
RESULTS SOCS-3 and CIS are rapidly induced by IL-2 in T cells .
To assess the potential role of SOCS proteins in lymphocytes , we initially examined their expression by Northern blot analysis .
Probing of multitissue mRNA blots revealed strong expression of CIS in a number of tissues , including thymus , spleen , pros-tate , and PBLs ( Fig .
1A ) .
While SOCS-4 mRNA was not detected in PBLs or the thymus , significant levels of expression were detected in the spleen and colon .
Interestingly , although SOCS-3 expression was detectable in the spleen , highest levels were seen in PBLs , with lower levels detected in other tissues examined ( Fig .
1A ) .
The more selective expression of SOCS-3 in comparison to other SOCS proteins suggests an important role in leukocytes .
The expression of SOCS proteins has been shown to be highly regulated by cytokines ( 7 , 10 , 17 , 26 ) .
To further study the regulation of SOCS-3 and CIS proteins in lymphocytes , Kit-225 cells were placed in cytokine-free , reduced-serum conditions for 12 h before treatment with IL-2 for periods of up to 24 h. The cells were then lysed , and SOCS-3 and CIS were immunoprecipitated for Western blotting .
In these experiments , SOCS-3 protein was detected within 30 min of IL-2 stimulation , peaked at 2 to 4 h , and returned to basal levels within 8 h ; CIS was first seen at 2 h , was strongly expressed between 4 and 12 h , and was again undetectable at 24 h ( Fig .
1B ) .
Interestingly , we observed only the 37-kDa form of CIS in Kit-225 cells , although 32- , 37- , and 45-kDa forms of this protein have been reported ( 13 , 29 ) .
In the YT NK-like cell line , SOCS-3 expression peaked between 2 and 4 h ( Fig .
1C ) ; in human PBL-derived blasts , SOCS-3 expression was noted within 30 min of IL-2 stimulation , peaked at 1 h , and declined thereafter ( Fig .
1C ) .
Alpha interferon was also able to induce low levels of SOCS-3 protein expression in Kit-225 cells ( data not shown ) .
To determine if SOCS-3 protein could be induced by other cytokines in lymphocytes , IL-3-responsive BaF3 cells were examined .
The cells were incubated in cytokine-free , reduced-serum medium for 12 h and then treated with IL-3 .
SOCS-3 protein was initially seen at 30 min , peaked at 1 h , and was absent by 4 h ( Fig .
1D ) .
These findings suggest that SOCS-3 is a short-lived immediate-early gene product , induced by IL-2 , and IL-3 in lymphocytes .
SOCS-3 is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-2 .
SOCS-1/JAB/SSI-1 has been shown to interact with Jak2 and inhibit its activity ( 7 , 17 , 26 ) , while in a yeast two-hybrid system SOCS-3 was shown to interact with Jak2-JH1 ( 12 ) .
However , whether SOCS proteins themselves are tyrosine phosphorylated has not been reported .
We therefore examined whether SOCS-3 may be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-2 .
Again Kit-225 cells were stimulated with IL-2 following 12 h in cytokine-free medium .
Cells were lysed at various intervals , immunoprecipitated with antiserum to SOCS-3 , and immunoblotted ( for SOCS-3 expression and tyrosine phosphorylation ) .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 was observed at 30 min and was maximal between 1 and 2 h , in parallel with SOCS-3 protein levels ( Fig .
2A ) .

SOCS-3 is expressed in lymphocytes and regulated by IL-2 and IL-3 .
( A ) Tissue mRNA blots were probed with cDNAs to CIS , SOCS-3 , and SOCS-4 , with B-actin as a control .
( B ) Kit-225 cells were treated as described above , and lysates were immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with antiserum to either SOCS-3 ( « SOCS $ 3 ) or CIS ( aCIS ) prior to SDS-PAGE .
Filters were blotted with the corresponding antibody .
( C ) Kit-225 cells , YT cells , or PHA blasts were rested overnight in 2 % FBS , stimulated with IL-2 for between 30 min and 8 h , lysed , immunoprecipitated , and immunoblotted with the antiserum to SOCS-3 .
( D ) BaF3 cells were placed in cytokine-free medium overnight and treated with IL-3 for the indicated times , and the lysates were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with antiserum to SOCS-3 .

tectable levels within 4 h ( data not shown ) .
Of note , although IL-4 also signals through y , , and activates the same Jak kinases , we did not observe induction of SOCS-3 protein expression in response to IL-4 at 1 h ( Fig .
2A , lane 6 ) .
Interestingly , despite the high levels of SOCS-3 induced by IL-3 in BaF3 cells , no tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in four experiments .
Consistent with previously published results ( 7 ) , no tyrosine phosphorylation of CIS was seen following its induction by IL-2 or IL-3 .
SOCS-3 associates with and is phosphorylated by Jak1 .
The rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 in response to IL-2 suggests that this protein is a substrate for an IL-2-activated tyrosine kinase .
Therefore , we investigated its possible interaction with the IL-Z-activated Jak kinases , Jak1 and Jak3 .
293T cells were transfected with cDNA encoding SOCS-3 , Jak1 , Jak3 , or and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiserum directed against SOCS-3 .
Jak1 was detected in the SOCS-3 immunoprecipitates in cells expressing Jak ] or expressing Jak1 and IL-2RB ( Fig .
2B , first and third panels , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
However , despite high levels of Jak3 expression in these cells , coprecipitation of Jak3 with SOCS-3 was not detected ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
SOCS-3 was strongly tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of Jak1 ( Fig .
2B , third panel , lanes 2 and 3 ) but only weakly in the presence of Jak3 ( lane 5 ) .
Phosphorylation of SOCS-3 was also observed when coexpressed with Lek and Jak2 ( data not shown ) .
The strong interaction observed between Jak1 and SOCS-3 suggest that Jakl could be responsible for the IL-2-induced phosphorylation of SOCS-3 observed in lymphocytes ( Fig .
2A ) .
SOCS-3 inhibits Jakl but not Jak3 phosphorylation , and this effect is maximal in the presence of IL-2RB .
As SOCS-1 inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak kinases , and in view of our findings , we wondered whether SOCS-3 would inhibit Jak1 or Jak3 phosphorylation .
To explore this possibility , 293T cells Vor .

SOCS-3 associates with the IL-2R complex following IL-2 stimulation of lymphocytes .
Kit-225 cells were prepared as described in the text and treated with IL-2 for 15 min .
Cells lysates were incubated with a GST-SOCS-3 fusion protein , and the immunoprecipitates ( IP ) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and membrane transfer .
Filters were immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine ( aPTyr ) ( A ) or anti-Jak1 ( aJak1 ) ( B ) .
( C ) BaF3 cells expressing both IL-2RB and SOCS-3 were treated with MG132 ( 20 mM ) for 30 min and were stimulated with IL-2 for 15 or 30 min ; lysates were immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with antiserum to SOCS3 and blotted for Jak1 ( upper panel ) or SOCS-3 ( lower panel ) .
Sizes are indicated in kilodaltons .
were transfected with cDNA encoding Jak1 or Jak3 in combination with receptor component IL-2RB or IL-2Ry and either SsOCS-1 , SOCS-2 , or SOCS-3 .
Coexpression studies consistently revealed that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 inhibited the phosphorylation of Jak1 ( Fig .
2C , lanes 3 and 8 ) , while SOCS-2 did not ( lane 2 ) .
is known to associate ( constitutively ) with Jak1 ; interestingly , the SOCS-3-mediated inhibition of Jak1 phosphorylation was strongly enhanced in the presence of IL-2RB , with almost complete abolition of Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation being observed ( lane 3 versus lane 6 ) .
Furthermore , in the previous experiment where Jak1 and SOCS-3 were coimmunoprecipitated , the phosphorylation of both Jak1 and SOCS-3 was significantly reduced in the presence of IL2RB ( Fig .
2B , lane 3 ) .
Consistent with previously published data , we found that 293T cells expressing SOCS-1 showed reduced phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2 ; in addition , we observed a small reduction in expression of Jak1 .
However , the inhibitory effect of SOCS-1 on Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation was not augmented by the presence of IL-2RB ( data not shown ) .
Coexpression of SOCS-3 or SOCS-2 with Jak3 had no inhibitory effect on Jak3 tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
2D , lanes 1 to 3 ) , and this was not influenced by the addition of either IL-2Rf or IL-2Ry ( the latter which is known to associate with Jak3 ) ; interestingly , SOCS-1 also did not inhibit Jak3 autophosphorylation when coexpressed in 293 cells ( data not shown ) .
Once again , no tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 was seen in the presence of Jak3 .
Thus , the findings indicate that while SOCS-3 does not interact with Jak3 , it can strongly associate with Jak1 and inhibit its phosphorylation , an effect that is enhanced in the presence of IL-2RfB .
SOCS-3 inhibits Jakl kinase activity .
Experiments from other groups have shown that SOCS-1 not only inhibits phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Tyk2 but also can inhibit Jak kinase activity , as measured by Jak1 autophosphorylation in in vitro kinase assays ( 20a ) .
These studies failed to detect any inhibition of kinase activity by SOCS-3 .
In view of our findings demonstrating an enhanced inhibitory effect of SOCS-3 in the presence of IL-2RB , we performed in vitro kinase assays using 293 T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Jak1 and SOCS proteins and immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody in the presence and absence of IL-2RB .
The addition of IL2RB to Jak1 and SOCS-3 markedly reduced the kinase activity of Jak1 , as measured by the ability to phosphorylate SOCS-3 ( Fig .
26 , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
When SOCS-2 was expressed with Jak1 , it was not phosphorylated in the in vitro kinase reaction ( lane 2 ) .
This finding suggests that SOCS-3 can strongly inhibit Jak1 activity in the presence of IL-2RfB .
SOCS-3 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated Jakl and IL-2RfB following IL-2 stimulation .
CIS has been shown to associate with EPOR and IL-3RB , , ( 29 ) ; in light of this finding and the interactions demonstrated above between SOCS-3 , Jak1 , and IL-2R $ , we examined whether SOCS-3 might associate with the IL-2R complex in lymphocytes .
We therefore generated a GST fusion protein containing full-length SOCS-3 , and lysates from untreated or IL-2-stimulated Kit-225 cells were incubated with the SOCS-3-GST fusion protein or a fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of phospholipase Cy ( PLCy ) .
The GST pull-down products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibody .
Following IL-2 treatment , GST-SOCS-3 coprecipitated a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein similar in molecular weight to IL-2Rf and one similar in size to tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak1 ( ~130 kDa ) ( Fig .
3A ) .
The fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of PLCy did not precipitate Jak1 but coprecipitated a protein of 120 kDa , perhaps tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCy , also known to be activated in response to IL-2 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
As a control , Kit-225 lysates were also immunoprecipitated with antibody specific for IL-Z2RB ; in these lanes we could detect both tyrosine-phosphorylated IL-ZRB chain and tyrosine phosphorylated Jak1 ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
To establish that the 75-kDa phosphoprotein with which the SOCS-3 fusion protein was observed to interact was indeed IL-2RfB , lysates were initially precleared by using IL-ZRB antibody before pre- Vor .
19 , 1999 cipitation with SOCS-3 fusion protein .
In fact , preclearing with antiserum to IL-2RB almost completely removed the 75-kDa phosphoprotein , indicating that this protein was IL-2R $ ( lanes 7 and 8 ) .
To confirm that SOCS-3 did associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak1 following IL-2 treatment , lysates from IL-2-stimulated Kit-225 cells were precipitated with GST-SOCS-3 or antiserum to IL-2RfB then and immunoblotted for Jak1 .
While the IL-2 receptor was constitutively associated with Jak1 , coprecipitation of GST-SOCS-3 with Jak1 was observed only following IL-2 treatment ( Fig .
3B ) .
These findings suggest that in lymphocytes , SOCS-3 can physically interact with Jak1 and IL-ZRB , but only following IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation .
We next examined whether Jakl could associate with SOCS-3 following IL-2 stimulation by using BaF3 cells expressing SOCS-3 ( Materials and Methods ) .
BaF3 cells expressing both IL-Z2RB and SOCS-3 that had been pretreated with MG132 ( 20 mM ) for 30 min were stimulated with IL-2 for 15 or 30 min , and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antisera to SOCS-3 and immunoblotted with Jak1 MAb .
In the presence of the proteosome inhibitor MG132 , we observed an enhanced association of SOCS-3 with Jak1 following IL-2 stimulation ( Fig .
3C ) .
This result suggests that Jak1 can associate with SOCS-3 and implies that this complex may normally be short-lived .
SOCS-3 inhibits IL-2-induced STATS activation .
Both CIS and SOCS-1 have been shown to inhibit various cytokine responses .
CIS was shown to associate with IL-3R and EPOR and to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of STATS ( 29 ) .
SOCS-1 was reported to reduce IL-6 and LIF responses by binding to Jak2 ( 7 , 17 , 26 ) .
We therefore examined the effect of SOCS-3 on IL-2- and IL-3-induced STATS phosphorylation .
We established clones in which SOCS-3 expression is suppressed by the presence of tetracycline ( 8 , 9 , 23 ) .
BaF3 cells containing both tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator and IL-2RB were created , following which SOCS-3 was introduced in the pUHD10-3 vector , such that expression of SOCS-3 was induced by removing the cells from tetracycline .
At 36 h after removal from tetracycline , including a 12-h period in the absence of cytokine , the cells were stimulated with either IL-2 or IL-3 for 15 min , and levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT 5b and IL-Z2RB were compared with those of cells maintained in tetracycline .
As shown in Fig .
4A , cells removed from tetracycline for 36 h express high levels of SOCS-3 in comparison to cells maintained in tetracycline .
IL-2- and IL-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b was seen in cells not expressing SOCS-3 ( Fig .
4A , lanes 5 , 6 , 11 , and 12 ) ; however , in cells removed from tetracycline ( which express high levels of SOCS-3 ) , a marked reduction in detectable STATS5b phosphorylation was observed in response to IL-2 ( lane 2 compared to lane 5 ; lane 8 compared to lane 11 ) , while there was only a marginal reduction in the IL-3-induced response ( lane 3 compared to lane 6 ; lane 9 compared to lane 12 ) .
We next examined the effect of CIS on IL-2- and IL-3-induced STAT5b phosphorylation .
Clones in which CIS expression is suppressed by the presence of tetracycline were established as described above .
The cells were stimulated with either IL-2 or IL-3 for 15 min ; as shown in Figure 4B ( lower panel ) , cells removed from tetracycline for 36 h expressed high levels of CIS or SOCS-3 in comparison to cells maintained in tetracycline .
There was no detectable inhibition of IL-2- and IL-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 5b in cells expressing CIS ( Fig .
4B , lanes 7 to 12 ) , but again SOCS-3 expression induced a marked reduction in IL-2-mediated STAT 5b phosphorylation ( lane 2 ) .
These data suggest that CIS THE SOCS-3 PHOSPHOPROTEIN REGULATES IL-2 RESPONSES - 4985 does not affect IL-2-mediated STATS5b activation as potently as can SOCS-3 .
SOCS-3 partially inhibits IL-2R and Jak1 phosphorylation .
We performed experiments similar to those described above in which lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to IL-2RfB , in cells with and without SOCS-3 .
Induction of SOCS-3 ( by removal from tetracycline ) resulted in a small but consistent reduction of IL-2-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor complex ( Fig .
4C ) .
Following SOCS-3 induction , there was a marked reduction in the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak1 associated with IL-2R ( Fig .
4C , lane 2 versus lane 4 ) , although there was no apparent reduction in the amount of Jak1 associated with the receptor ( Fig .
4C , second panel ) .
In parallel experiments no detectable reduction in IL-3-induced IL-3R $ , , tyrosine phosphorylation was observed following removal of tetracycline ( Fig .
4D ) .
SOCS-3 inhibits IL-2- and IL-3-mediated proliferation .
We next examined the effect of SOCS-3 and CIS expression on IL-2-mediated proliferation in BaF3 cells expressing IL-2RfB .
Again cells were incubated in the absence of tetracycline for 36 h , including 12 h free from cytokine .
The cells were subsequently incubated in medium either with or without cytokine ( IL-2 [ 100 U/ml ] or IL-3 [ 50 U/mI ] ) for 24 h , and levels of DNA synthesis were measured by incorporation of [ °HJthymidine .
Cells expressing SOCS-3 had markedly reduced levels of thymidine incorporation in response to both IL-2 and IL-3 compared to clones that had been left in tetracycline and that did not express SOCS-3 ( Fig .
5B ) .
However , smaller reductions in thymidine incorporation were noted in cells that expressed CIS ( Fig .
5A ) .
These findings are representative of six individual experiments and demonstrate that induced expression of SOCS-3 can more strongly suppress IL-2 ( and IL-3 ) prolifer-ative responses than does expression of CIS .
DISCUSSION Signaling in response to IL-2 and to cytokines such as IL-4 , IL-7 , and IL-15 ( which signal through y , , Jak1 , and Jak3 ) is known to be essential for normal lymphocyte development and proliferation ( 22 ) .
Although much is understood with respect to how activating signals are transduced , little is known about their control .
In this report , we describe the induction and tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 in lymphocytes , including in human PBLs , in response to IL-2 and report that it interacts with IL-ZR and Jak1 .
We show that SOCS-3 is strongly phosphorylated by Jak1 , that SOCS-3 can inhibit Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation , and that this inhibition is enhanced by the presence of IL-ZRB .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that SOCS-3 can abrogate IL-2-induced phosphorylation and activation of STATS and IL-2-mediated proliferation , suggesting that in lymphocytes SOCS-3 can regulate IL-2 responses .
Cytokines induce SOCS/CIS/SSI family members as immediate-early genes ( 7 , 17 , 26 , 29 ) .
Consistent with this , SOCS-3 protein is particularly rapidly induced and tyrosine phosphorylated in human PBLs in response to IL-2 , being detected as early as 30 min following stimulation .
This family of proteins are also rapidly degraded , suggesting that SOCS protein function is only transiently required .
In Kit-225 cells , SOCS-3 levels fall within 4 h , while in PBLs they decline after 1 h ; in com-parison , CIS is strongly detected between 4 and 12 h. Interestingly , CIS has recently been shown to be subject to ubiquitination and to degradation by the proteasome pathway ( 28 ) .
In the experiments described , addition of proteasome inhibitors resulted in significant accumulation of both the ubiquitinated CIS and CIS-EPOR complexes , both of which are normally present only transiently ; furthermore , proteasome inhibition 4986 COHNEY ET AL .

SOCS-3 but not CIS inhibits IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STATS5b and Jak1 .
( A ) Two BaF3 clones ( S3 CL2 and $ 3 CL3 ) expressing IL-2RB , in which SOCS-3 was absent due to the presence of tetracycline ( tet ) ( + ) or in which expression of SOCS-3 was induced by removal from tetracycline ( - ) , were treated with IL-2 or IL-3 for 15 min , and lysates were subject to immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine ( « PTyr ) and immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with anti-STAT5b .
SOCS-3 levels were checked by immunoblotting ( lower panel ) .
( B ) BaF3 clones in which CIS or SOCS-3 expression was controlled by removal from tetracycline were treated as described above , and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine and anti-STAT5b .
CIS and SOCS-3 levels were checked by immunoblotting ( lower panel ) .
( C and D ) SOCS-3-expressing cells were treated as described ab ove with IL-2 , immunoprecipitated anti-IL-2RB , and blotted for phosphotyrosine ( C , top ) , Jak1 ( C , middle ) , or ( C , bottom ) or with IL-3 , immunoprecipitated with anti-IL-3RfB , , and blotted for antiphosphotyrosine ( D ) .
Sizes are indicated in kilodaltons .
also prolonged the phosphorylation of both the EPOR and STATS .
The proteasome inhibitors LLaL and LLM have also been shown to stabilize SOCS-1 expression in M1 cells ( 18 ) .
It had previously been suggested that the proteasome pathway contributes to regulation of the IL-2-stimulated Jak-STAT tyrosine phosphorylation ( 30 ) , although neither STATS nor Jak kinase appears to be ubiquitinated ( 5 , 30 ) .
Thus , ubiquitination of the SOCS proteins and their degradation by the proteasome might account for their rapid turnover and may be a means by which they modulate cytokine signaling pathways .
SOCS-3 is unusual among SOCS family members with regard to its tyrosine phosphorylation .
Tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable in both Kit-225 cells and PBLs as carly as protein was observed .
SOCS-3 was strongly tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of Jak1 in 293 T cells , and while tyrosine phosphorylation was also seen with Jak2 and Lok , it was sig- Vor .

SOCS-3 inhibits cytokine-induced lymphocyte proliferation .
Lymphocyte proliferation was assessed by [ *H|thymidine incorporation as described in Materials and Methods .
The experiments were performed on BaF3 clones ( expressing CIS [ A ] or SOCS-3 [ B ] ) , in which SOCS-3 was absent due to the presence of tetracycline ( Tet ) ( + ) or in which expression of SOCS-3 was induced by removal from tetracycline ( - ) .
SOCS-3 expression in the absence of tetracycline was confirmed by immunoblotting ( not shown ) .
Med , cytokine-free medium .
nificantly lower with Jak3 .
The presence of tyrosine residues in the region between the SH2 domain and the SOCS box may explain the propensity of SOCS-3 for tyrosine phosphorylation in comparison to other SOCS proteins .
While the precise role and importance of this tyrosine phosphorylation is unknown , the strict regulation of SOCS-3 through both rapid changes in protein levels and tyrosine phosphorylation further point to an important role for SOCS-3 in the IL-2 response .
It is apparent that cytokine signaling can be controlled by a number of mechanisms .
Phosphatases are known to regulate tyrosine phosphorylation in response to cytokines and growth factors , a classic example being the SHZ-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 , which is recruited to a number of activated cytokine receptors , including IL-4R , EPOR , IL-3R , and the IL-ZR ( 19 ) .
IL-2 responses are also thought to be regulated by degradation of receptor components such as the calpain-mediated cleavage of y , , ( 21 ) and by receptor internalization .
A family of PIAS proteins that are thought to interact with STATs and inhibit their activity have also been identified ( 6 ) .
Clearly , many mechanisms may contribute to downregulation of the stimulatory response , and the SOCS proteins add yet another level of control .
The specificity of SOCS proteins for individual cytokine responses remains uncertain .
In the case of CIS , the only established interactions are with EPOR and IL-3R signaling through which CIS can partially inhibit ( 13 , 29 ) .
We also find that CIS can partially inhibit IL-2 responses , although the effects are less potent than those observed with SOCS-3 .
SOCS-1 has been shown to strongly inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling in M1 cells ( 7 , 17 , 26 ) , and both SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 can inhibit LIF ( 12 , 14 ) - and GH ( 1 ) -mediated signaling .
LIF induces SOCS-3 mRNA expression in the hypothalamus , and more dramatically in the pituitary , of mice , and in AT -20 corticotroph cells , stable overexpression of SOCS-3 reduced LIF-mediated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and activation and adenocorticotropin secretion ( 2 ) .
Leptin was shown to induce hypothalamic SOCS-3 mRNA , and overexpression of SOCS-3 was able to inhibit leptin-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation ( 3 ) .
Thus , it seems clear that SOCS-3 may have a role in response to a number of cytokines .
SOCS-1-deficient mice have been generated and are reported to have small thymuses ; though healthy at birth , they exhibit stunted growth and pro gressive lymphocytopenia and die before weaning in association with fatty degeneration and monocytic infiltration of the liver ( 16 , 25 ) .
These observations suggest that at least SOCS-1 has an essential role in homeostasis .
In addition , the mechanisms by which SOCS family members inhibit signaling appear to differ .
CIS can interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of IL-3RfB , , and the EPOR ( 29 ) , associating with a known STATS binding site ( 28 ) .
Alterna-tively , following ubiquitination , CIS may chaperone the receptor into the proteasome pathway as alluded to earlier ( 28 ) .
While the effect of CIS seems to be mediated primarily through interaction with the receptor , SOCS-1 was cloned by its ability to interact with Jak2 ( through its JH1 kinase domain ) and has the capacity to interact with and inhibit members of the Jak family ( 7 ) .
A yeast two-hybrid screen showed that SOCS-3 could also interact with the JH1 domain of Jak2 and the lymphocyte-specific kinase Lok ( 12 ) .
Our findings suggest that SOCS-3 can interact with Jak1 and inhibit its activity , but the enhanced inhibition observed in the presence of IL-Z2RB suggests that the receptor plays an important role in facilitating SOCS-3 action .
The SOCS-3 fusion protein was able to interact with Jak1 and IL-2RB only after the IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor complex ; this is in keeping with the requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of the targets of both SOCS-1 ( 18 ) and CIS ( 29 ) .
Interestingly , previous yeast two-hybrid studies failed to show an interaction between SOCS-3 and IL-Z2RB , possibly because of this dependence on tyrosine phosphorylation ( 12 ) .
However , it remains unclear whether the interaction of SOCS-3 with the receptor is direct or if it occurs solely through the binding of SOCS-3 to Jak1 , which in turn is associated with the receptor .
It is of note that SOCS-3 did not significantly inhibit IL-3-mediated STATS phosphorylation , even though IL-3R signals through Jak1 and Jak2 .
Also of note , CIS did not inhibit cytokine-mediated Stat5b phosphorylation , suggesting that SOCS-3 may specifically mediate this effect .
Similarly , a recent report suggests that gamma interferon signaling ( which uses both Jak1 and Jak2 ) is inhibited by SOCS-1 but not SOCS-3 ( 24 ) .
Therefore , while SOCS-3 has the ability to inhibit Jak activity , the specificity of the inhibition may be receptor dependent ; with respect to the IL-2 response , the interaction with both IL-2R and Jak1 ( rath-er than Jak3 ) seem pivotal .
4988 COHNEY ET AL .
In addition to the inhibitory effect SOCS-3 exerted on IL-2-induced STATS phosphorylation , we observed a significant inhibition of both IL-2- and IL-3-mediated lymphocyte proliferation .
This is consistent with the ability of SOCS-1 to inhibit responses to various cytokines .
However , despite the marked effect on STATS phosphorylation , SOCS-3 did not completely inhibit IL-2-induced receptor phosphorylation and proliferation , suggesting that not all responses to IL-2 are blocked by SOCS-3 expression .
Additionally , the mechanism by which SOCS-3 inhibits IL-3-mediated proliferation is unclear but may be independent of Stat5b .
In conclusion , our findings indicate that in lymphocytes , SOCS-3 is strongly and rapidly expressed in response to IL-2 ( and perhaps other cytokines ) and can interact with IL-2R and Jak1 , following which it inhibits further IL-2 responses .
The detection of SOCS-3 in human PBLs in response to IL-2 is of particular importance in light of the continuing uncertainty of the precise physiological role ( s ) of SOCS proteins .
This find-ing , coupled with its rapid induction , tyrosine phosphorylation , and ability to inhibit IL-2-mediated proliferation , suggest an important role in controlling lymphocyte function .
