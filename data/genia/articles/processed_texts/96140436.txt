2 E2F-1 Blocks Terminal Differentiation and Causes Proliferation in Transgenic Megakaryocytes CHANTALE T. GUY , WEN ZHOU , STEPHEN KAUFMAN , anp MURRAY O. ROBINSON® Amgen , Inc. , Thousand Oaks , California 91320 Received 30 August 1995/Returned for modification 18 October 1995/Accepted 26 October 1995 The transcription factor E2F-1 plays a central role in the cell cycle through its ability to activate genes involved in cell division .
E2F-1 activity is regulated by a number of proteins , including the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product , cyclin-dependent kinases , and their inhibitors , proteins that have been implicated in the control of certain developmental processes .
To investigate a potential role of E2F-1 in differentiation , we assayed the ability of megakaryocytes to form platelets in an in vivo transgenic model .
E2F-1 expression in megakaryocytes blocked differentiation during maturation , resulting in severe thrombocytopenia .
Ultrastructural analysis of megakaryocytes revealed abnormal development characterized by hyperdemarcation of cytoplasmic membranes and reduced numbers of alpha granules .
Administration of megakaryocyte growth and development factor or interleukin 6 could not overcome the differentiation block .
Additionally , E2F-1 caused massive megakaryocyte accumulation in both normal and ectopic sites , first evident in E15 embryonic liver .
Furthermore , significant apoptosis was observed in transgenic megakaryocytes .
These data indicate that E2F-1 can prevent terminal differentiation , probably through its cell cycle-stimulatory activity .
E2F-1 is a transcription factor that is thought to play a central role in the control of cell division ( 30 , 37 ) .
It is one member of a family of at least four E2F proteins whose functions appear to be similar ( 4 , 11 , 16 , 22 , 27 , 32 , 49 ) .
The DNA binding and transcriptional activity of E2F-1 is maximally activated by heterodimerization with the DP-1 family of proteins ( 2 , 12 , 17 , 28 ) , suggesting that the active complex is an E2F-DP heterodimer .
E2F binds the consensus sequence TTTCGCGC and activates transcription of a number of genes involved in the G , and S phases of cell division .
Such genes include myc ( 35 ) , myb ( 29 ) , and the dihydrofolate reductase ( 53 ) , thymidine kinase ( 7 ) , thymidylate synthetase ( 34 ) , DNA polymerase « and cyclin D1 ( 45 ) , and E2F-1 ( 20 , 25 , 36 ) genes .
These genes contain E2F consensus sites in their promoters and/or are transcriptionally responsive to E2F protein .
The expression and effects of E2F-1 in cultured cells have been well characterized .
E2F-1 mRNA is cell cycle regulated , appearing during G/G , through S ( 27 , 49 , 53 ) .
Overexpression of E2F-1 in 3T 3 cells causes reentry into the cell cycle ( 26 , 58 ) and , in primary fibroblasts , causes transformation ( 24 , 51 ) .
E2F-1 is positively correlated with cell proliferation , as E2F-1 is expressed in all tumor cell lines assayed ( 16 , 32 ) and is undetectable in senescent cells in culture ( 6 ) .
E2F function is thought to be regulated by a cascade of cell cycle-regulatory proteins .
E2F-1 is a target of the tumor suppressor Rb , the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene and a protein with an inhibitory effect on proliferation .
E2F-1 interacts directly with Rb , resulting in suppression of E2F-mediated transactivation ( 9 , 15 ) .
Rb , in turn , is negatively regulated through phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) .
CDKs are themselves inhibited by the p16 and p21 classes of kinase inhibitors .
For instance , E2F-1 can induce DNA synthesis in transforming growth factor B growth-inhibited mink lung epithelial cells ( 47 ) , suggesting that E2F-1 acts downstream of transforming growth factor B , which has been reported to block the cell cycle through one or more of * Corresponding author .

685 the CDK inhibitors .
Additionally , the p16 CDK inhibitor can block EZF activity in a cyclin D1-stimulated cell ( 46 ) .
Recent data suggest that Rb , cyclin D1 , and p21 may play a significant role in differentiation of muscle .
Rb appears to be necessary for proper differentiation of cultured myoblasts ( 13 ) , cyclin D1 can inhibit myogenic differentiation , an effect counteracted by coexpression of p16 or p21 ( 52 ) , and expression of the p21 CDK inhibitor is positively correlated with muscle differentiation ( 14 , 40 ) .
Functional inactivation of the Rb gene in mice results in developmental defects in erythrocytes and some neurons ( 5 , 23 , 31 ) .
It has been postulated that Rb acts by causing cells to exit the cell cycle ( reviewed in reference 56 ) .
It is possible that Rb and p21 accomplish this through their ability to directly or indirectly inhibit EZF , suggesting that E2F may act to prevent differentiation .
EZ2F-1 is present in a number of human tissue RNAs ( 27 ) , including , paradoxically , RNAs of tissues usually associated with very little mitotic activity .
The function or regulation of E2F in cells in vivo is not well un-derstood .
To address the role of E2F-1 in differentiation , we examined the consequences of deregulation of E2F-1 expression in vivo by using the well-defined differentiative process of platelet formation as a model ( reviewed in reference 10 ) .
Megakaryocyte precursors proliferate and then exit the cell cycle as dip-loid megakaryoblasts .
These cells , readily identifiable because of their large size , mature through three morphologically defined stages , finally fragmenting into blood platelets .
Experimental manipulation of this process can be easily assayed by monitoring circulating platelet levels in peripheral blood .
Furthermore , megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation can be positively regulated by several factors , including the recently cloned megakaryocyte growth and development factor ( MGDF ) ( 3 , 33 ) .
To target E2F-1 expression to megakaryocytes , we generated transgenic mice expressing the human E2F-1 gene under the control of the megakaryocyte-specific platelet factor 4 ( PF4 ) promoter ( 42 ) .
Expression of this promoter is thought to initiate as the megakaryocytes exit the cell cycle , such that effects of the transgene would be primarily directed to postmitotic megakaryocytes .

mice was reverse transcribed , amplified for 25 cycles , and analyzed .
The amplified products for huE2F-1 and GAPDH were 321 and 352 bp long , respectively .

Magnification , X62 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Transgenic mice .
A 1.2-kb EcoRV-BamHI fragment of the human E2F-1 ( buE2F-1 ) cDNA was filled in with Klenow enzyme and cloned into the EcoRV site of an expression cassette containing 1.1 kb of the rat PF4 upstream region 5 ' to the EcoRV site followed 3 ' by the simian virus 40 small-T intron and poly-adenylation sequences .
The construct was isolated as a NofI-Xhol fragment , and transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection as described previously ( 19 ) .
Transgenic lines were screened by using PCR with oligonucleotide primers used for the reverse transcription ( RT ) -PCR analysis ( see below ) .
Homozygous mice were identified as previously described ( 44 ) .
Histology .
Tissues from adults ( 4 weeks old ) and fetuses ( day 15 postcoitus ) were harvested from normal and transgenic animals , fixed in 10 % zinc-formalin , and embedded in paraffin .
Femurs were additionally decalcified ( J. T. Baker ) for 1 h following fixation .
Tissues were cut into 4-wm sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( Fischer ) for examination .
Megakaryocyte numbers were determined by photographing the bone marrow and spleen sections at magnifications of X400 and X100 , respectively , and then counting megakaryocytes in the photograph and determining the size of the photographic field .
Data are presented as cells per 0.5-mm > area .
Detection of apoptotic cells .
Apoptotic cells were detected by using a modification of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling ( TUNEL ) method by amplifying the apoptotic signal with a three-step staining procedure ( 54 ) .
Spleen sections were prepared as described above , and then endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with a solution of 0.1 % of phenylhydrazine in phosphate-buffered saline .
Peripheral blood analysis .
One hundred microliters of blood from the lateral tail vein was mixed with 1/10 volume of 3 % EDTA and examined on a Technicon H1-E hematology analyzer ( Myles , Tarrytown , N.Y. ) .
Blood smears were prepared by spreading peripheral blood onto a glass slide and staining for 1 min with a differential polychrome stain ( Fischer ) .
To type megakaryocytes , bone marrow from three animals of each group was extruded by gentle pneumatic pressure from femurs with the ends removed .
The marrow was then smeared onto glass slides and stained by using an acrospray hematology slide stainer ( model 7120 ; Wescor , Inc. , Logan , Utah ) .
The megakaryocytes were identified and staged according to previously established criteria ( 39 ) .
At least 135 identifiable cells were counted for cach mouse .
RT-PCR analysis .
For the RT-PCR , 50 , 100 , or 200 ng of total RNA from bone marrow of the indicated transgenic ( PE series ) or wild-type mice was reverse transcribed , amplified for 25 cycles by using huER2F-1 primers , and analyzed as described previously ( 43 ) except that recombinant TH polymerase ( Per-kin Elmer , Norwalk , Conn. ) was substituted for Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase .
Reactions using glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) primers were included to demonstrate uniformity of RNA amount and efficiency of amplification among samples .
Oligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCR were huE2F-1 ( forward , 5-ACCTTCGTA GCATTGCAGACC-3 ' ; reverse , 5-TTCITTGCTCCAGGCTGAGTAG-3 ' ) and GAPDH ( forward , 5-GGGTGGAGCCAAACGGGTCATC-3 ' ; reverse , GCCA GTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC-3 ' ) .
Exposure times were 72 h for E2F-1 and 1 h for GAPDH .
Quantitation of the amount of radioactivity in each band was performed with a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) .
Immunohistochemistry .
Four-micrometer sections of paraffin-embedded for-malin-fixed bone marrow samples were incubated with 5 ug of a huE2F-1 mouse monoclonal antibody ( KH95 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , Calif. ) per ml and polyclonal rabbit serum specific for PF4 ( 1:500 dilution ; Alexis Corp. , Switzerland ) and then visualized by using species-specific secondary antibodies ( anti-mouse antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin and anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate ; 1:200 dilution ; Dako , Carpin-teria , Calif. ) .
The slides were imaged on an ACAS confocal microscope ( Merid-ian Instruments , Okemus , Mich. ) and processed by using Adobe Photoshop version 3.0 ( Adobe Systems , Inc. , Mountain View , Calif. ) .
Electron microscopy .
Femurs from control and transgenic mice were excised , split lengthwise , and immersed in 2.0 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacody-late buffer at pH 7.3 .
After overnight fixation , the marrow was gently extracted and rinsed in buffer for 24 h. The tissue was postfixed in 1 % aqueous osmium tetroxide prior to alcoholic dehydration and infiltration with Medcast epoxy resin ( Ted Pella , Redding , Calif. ) .
Following polymerization , sections were cut from each block and stained with toluidine blue .
Selected areas were ultrathin sectioned .
The sections were contrast enhanced with uranyl acetate and lead citrate prior to examination on a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope .
RESULTS Generation of E2F-1 transgenic mice .
Following microinjec-tion , several lines of mice were established , and four of these were assayed for expression of the huEZ2F-1 mRNA in bone marrow by semiquantitative RT-PCR using huE2F-1 primers ( Fig .
1 ) .
Primers were chosen such that mouse E2F-1 sequences would not be amplified .
All four transgenic lines expressed the transgene , albeit at different levels .
Bone marrow RNA from line PE82 appeared to have the highest levels of expression , followed by PES1 > PE50 > PE4Z ( Fig .
1A ) .
Nontransgenic mice did not show any amplification of huE2F-1 sequences .
Quantitation of the DNA in each band with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager showed a 10-fold range of expression between the highest- and lowest-expressing lines .
To determine which cells in the bone marrow were expressing huE2F-1 protein , double immunostaining and confocal microscopic imaging were performed on bone marrow sections from the PE82 line ( Fig .
1B ) .
Use of anti-E2F-1 antibodies and a phycoerythrin-labeled secondary antibody revealed nuclear staining in transgenic megakaryocytes .
In contrast , no staining was observed in megakaryocytes from nontransgenic bone marrow ( Fig .
1B ) .
Although megakaryocytes can be identified by their large size and distinct morphology , immunostaining with antibodies against PF4 , a cytoplasmic megakaryocyte-specific marker whose promoter drives E2F-1 expression , was used to confirm the identification of both transgenic and nontransgenic megakaryocytes .
Green cytoplasmic fluorescence confirmed the identity of the megakaryocytes ( Fig .
1B ) .

E2F-1 blocks terminal differentiation of megakaryocytes .
To examine the possible effects of E2F-1 expression in megakaryocytes , blood samples from several mice of each line were analyzed by blood smears and by a Technicon H-1E hematology analyzer for alterations in peripheral blood parameters .
The highest-expressing line , PE82 , exhibited severe thrombocyto-penia , with platelet levels measured at 87 X 10°/pul of blood ( standard deviation [ SD ] , 21 % 10°/pl of blood ) , representing only 7 % of normal levels ( Fig .
2A ) .
This value is likely an overestimate of the actual platelet count as a result of contamination of the platelet window with other cells ( data not shown ) .
In support of this assertion , no blood platelets could be detected by cytologic examination ( Fig .
2B ) .
The other three lines exhibited lesser degrees of thrombocytopenia ( Fig .
2A ) ; platelet numbers given by the H-1E analyzer were consistent with the platelet levels observed in blood smears of each line ( data not shown ) .
All other hematopoietic cell values assayed were within the range of the negative littermates ( data not shown ) .
Each line maintained a specific level of thrombo-cytopenia , the severity of which correlated directly with the level of E2F-1 mRNA .
Homozygous mice generated from line PE50 confirmed this correlation , as mice carrying two insertions of the transgene had lower platelet counts than their heterozygote littermates ( Fig .
2A ) .
This relationship between expression level and degree of thrombocytopenia suggests that the transgene exerts its effects in a dose-dependent manner .
To determine the nature of the defect present in these mice , megakaryocytes in the PE82 bone marrow were further analyzed .
The cells appeared larger than normal and displayed unusually large nuclei , some nuclei appearing as ring struc-tures .
Despite the unusual appearance of the megakaryocytes , it was possible to determine their maturation stage by using standard criteria ( 39 ) .
The majority ( 54 % ) of the megakaryocytes evaluated in the transgenic bone marrow were morphologically judged to be stage 2 , characterized by a lobated nu-cleus , a lightly basophilic cytoplasm , and lack of granulation ( Fig .
2C ) .
Normal control mice had equal numbers of the three stages .
Ultrastructural analysis of bone marrow megakaryocytes from the PE82 line demonstrated further evidence of abnormal differentiation .
Nontransgenic megakaryocytes exhibited typical networks of cytoplasmic membrane formation that define and demarcate the presumptive nascent platelets ( Fig .
3A ) .
In contrast , the cytoplasm of the transgenic megakaryocytes displayed regions of hyperdemarcation , often excluding alpha granules ( Fig .

granules were also reduced in the transgenic mice .
This abnormal membrane formation was not uniform , appearing in patches throughout the megakaryocyte cytoplasm .
Such structures are not seen in normal megakaryocytes and appear to be inconsistent with nascent platelet formation .
We conclude that E2F-1 expression in megakaryocytes acts to block differentiation during the postmitotic maturation phase .
This block in differentiation precludes the formation of platelets , causing extreme thrombocytopenia .
Transgenic megakaryocytes are refractory to treatment with platelet growth factors .
In an attempt to overcome the differentiation block observed in the E2F-l-overexpressing mice , five animals each from lines PE82 and PES1 along with five negative littermates were injected daily for 5 days with either 1 ug of recombinant human MGDF or 10 ug of recombinant human interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) .
Nontransgenic mice responded predictably to both treatments , exhibiting a 70 % increase in peripheral platelet count in response to MGDF and a 30 % increase in response to IL-6 ( Table 1 ) .
In contrast , the transgenic lines were completely refractory to either MGDF or IL-6 administration , exhibiting no significant change in circulating platelet levels .
The lack of responsiveness to MGDF was not due to the absence of its cognate receptor , c-mpl , as the MGDF receptor was confirmed on these cells by immunohis-tochemistry ( data not shown ) .
Both MGDF and IL-6 are known to promote differentiation of megakaryocytes ( 21 , 33 ) .
Furthermore , IL-6 has been shown to induce terminal differentiation in mature megakaryocytes ( 1 ) .
It appears that E2F-1 overexpression acts to prevent the megakaryocytes from reaching a stage of maturation at which they are able to respond to the differentiative signals initiated by these cytokines .
E2F-1 causes massive megakaryocyte accumulation .
To investigate additional changes induced by overexpression of E2F-1 protein , PE82 was chosen for further analysis .
Mice from this line exhibited a number of striking characteristics .
These mice lived only 9 weeks on average .
As mice aged , the erythrocyte count often decreased .
Postmortem examination of these animals revealed evidence of internal bleeding , perhaps the cause of death .
Additionally , all mice examined displayed splenomegaly , up to approximately 10 times normal spleen weight , as well as grossly enlarged lymph nodes .
Hema-toxylin-and-eosin-stained sections of decalcified femurs from these animals revealed increased numbers of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow as well as a disruption of the bone marrow architecture ( Fig .
4B ) .
The bone marrow sinuses were greatly enlarged , with many containing megakaryocytes .
Microscopic examination of the spleen ( Fig .
4D ) and lymph node ( Fig .
4F ) revealed a massive accumulation of megakaryocytes .
Megakaryocytes in the spleen were primarily found in the red pulp and at the subcapsular region of the tissue .
In the lymph node , a tissue normally devoid of megakaryocytes , these cells were observed in clusters throughout the tissue .
Megakaryocytes were also found in the blood , lungs , and livers of these animals ( data not shown ) .
To quantitate the number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and spleen , cells were enumerated by microscopic examination of tissue sections ( Fig .
5A ) .
The bone marrow exhibited an approximately fivefold increase in megakaryocyte number in the two lines examined , PE5S1 and PE82 .
Megakaryocyte numbers in the spleen were increased 10-fold in the same lines .
In addition to the megakaryocyte numbers , the numbers of megakaryocyte progenitor cells were determined by quantitating the number of megakaryocyte colony-forming units ( CFU-Meg ) in bone marrow of PES1 and PE82 .
As shown in Fig .
5B , the number of CFU-Meg was increased between 2.5- and 4-fold , indicating that the number of megakaryocyte progenitors was increased in both transgenic lines assayed .
To determine if the megakaryocytosis was restricted to the adult mice , fetuses from line PE82 were examined at day 15 postcoitus .
Examination of embryonic liver , the site of hematopoiesis during fetal development , revealed increased numbers of megakaryocytes , similar to the phenotype seen in adult tissues ( Fig .
4H ) .
Every transgenic mouse in the litter exhibited the phenotype .
This finding demonstrates that the onset of megakaryocytosis is at least coincident with early fetal hema-topoiesis , suggesting that the transgene alone is sufficient to cause the phenotype .
Interestingly , large numbers of these cells do not remain in the liver after hematopoiesis moves to adult tissues .
Transgenic megakaryocytes are eliminated by apoptosis .
The extent of megakaryocytosis in the transgenic mice suggests that the early megakaryocytes are proliferating .
However , it is possible that the megakaryocyte accumulation observed is due to increased survival of cells and not increased proliferation .
To address the fate of the transgenic megakaryocytes , further studies were performed .
Microscopically , approximately 10 % of the megakaryocytes observed appeared to have nuclei with altered staining patterns , suggestive of the appearance of apoptosis .
Using a modification of the TUNEL method ( 54 ) to detect DNA fragmentation , the presence of apoptosis was confirmed in about 1/10 of the megakaryocytes in the transgenic spleen ( Fig .
6A and C ) .
Examination of 60 identifiable megakaryocytes in normal spleen sections ( Fig .
6B and D ) revealed no evidence of apoptosis , suggesting that apoptosis , if it occurs at all in splenic megakaryocytes , is a rare event .
Megakaryocytes are known to undergo endomitosis during the maturation phase , resulting in increases in DNA content up to 128N ( 18 ) .
It is possible that such amplification of DNA leads to a positive signal , using the TUNEL technique .
However , because no signal was observed in the nontransgenic megakaryocytes , we consider it unlikely that the signal observed in a subset of the transgenic cells is the result of endomitosis .

with apoptotic characteristics , providing support for this conclusion ( data not shown ) .
The presence of large numbers of megakaryocytes in normal and ectopic sites , combined with the rapid removal of megakaryocytes through apoptosis , provides strong evidence that the transgene is stimulating a dramatic increase in megakaryocyte production .
DISCUSSION The decision between proliferation and differentiation requires the concerted activity of genes that regulate the cell cycle .
Although E2F-1 is known to have a positive effect on cell division in vitro ( 24 , 26 , 51 ) , the data presented here demonstrate that E2F-1 can both stimulate cell division and modulate the differentiative potential of a cell in vivo .
E2F-1 expression in the megakaryocyte lineage leads to greatly increased numbers of mature megakaryocytes .
However , it appears that the differentiative capacity of these cells is reduced , causing arrest during the maturation phase .
Agents known to positively affect terminal differentiation of megakaryocytes can not function to bypass the differentiation block .
Because these megakaryocytes EZ2F-1 BLOCKS TERMINAL DIFFERENTIATION 691 can not terminally differentiate into platelets , they appear to die through an apoptotic pathway .
E2F-1 has been shown previously to cooperate with p53 to induce apoptosis in cultured cells ( 41 , 48 , 57 ) .
Such a scenario fits with the `` clash `` hypothesis in which conflicting signals of growth and growth arrest cause entry into the apoptotic pathway ( 8 ) .
The complete pen-etrance and the early onset of the phenotype suggest that the megakaryocytosis is likely due solely to the effects of E2F-1 expression and not due to secondary events or mutations .
The megakaryocyte accumulation seen in these animals could result from either increased production of early PF4-positive cells ( proliferation ) or increased survival of the megakaryocytes .
The observation that the cells are rapidly being removed through apoptosis suggests that there is increased production of megakaryocytes .
However , because these mice are severely thrombocytopenic , endogenous mechanisms should be acting to increase the number and size of the megakaryocytes ( 10 ) .
Such mechanisms do not appear to account for the massive accumulation observed in the EZF-1 transgenic mice .
Three other mouse models of severe thrombocytopenia that have been described report two- to fourfold increases in bone marrow megakaryocyte numbers ( 38 , 44 , 50 ) , similar to the fivefold increase seen in the E2F-1-expressing mice .
However , the E2F-1-expressing mice also have 10-fold increases in the number of splenic megakaryocytes as well as infiltration of megakaryocytes into ectopic sites such as the lymph node and liver .
Such numbers and distribution of megakaryocytes have not been observed in the other thrombocytopenia models , suggesting that there is some additional proliferative signal in the E2F-1-expressing mice .
We therefore postulate that E2F-1 is able to increase the number of cell divisions in the committed precursor cells .
Although E2F-1 appears to stimulate increased proliferation of megakaryocyte precursors , it is unable to prevent the cells from initiating differentiation .
This is likely due to the temporal onset of PF4 promoter function , occurring as megakaryocyte precursors are entering a differentiative phase .
Despite expression of E2F-1 , these committed precursors can exit the cell cycle and give rise to postmitotic , albeit abnormal megakaryocytes .
Targeting expression of E2F-1 to mitotic progenitor cells would address whether the protein could prevent differentiation into megakaryocytes .
Previous experiments suggest that Rb may be important for differentiation of this lineage , as megakaryocytes from mice expressing a megakaryocyte-targeted simian virus 40 tempera-ture-sensitive large T antigen were unable to terminally differentiate ( 44 ) .
A possible mechanism to explain the phenotypes observed in both of these mice stipulates an interaction between Rb and E2F-1 to control differentiation .
We propose that Rb , known to be present in megakaryocytes ( 55 ) , allows the cell to differentiate through inhibition of EZF transcriptional activity .
An increase of active E2F-1 ( either through overexpression or by blocking Rb ) prevents the cell from terminally differentiating .
This cell , receiving conflicting signals of differentiation and proliferation , activates an apoptotic pathway leading to cell death .
It is formally possible that E2F-1 functions not as a transcriptional activator but only to bind and inactivate Rb .
Transgenic expression of E2F-1 mutants deficient for either Rb binding or transcription would be required to rule out this possibility .
These results demonstrate the dramatic effects of deregulation of the E2F-1 protein in vivo and suggest that the cell cycle-regulatory proteins , CDKs , CDK inhibitors , and Rb function to control differentiation through modulation of E2F activity .
Furthermore , this mouse may serve as a useful tool to 692 GUY ET AL .
