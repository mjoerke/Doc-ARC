Coexpression of the Interleukin-13 and Interleukin-4 Genes Correlates With Their Physical Linkage in the Cytokine Gene Cluster on Human Chromosome 5q23-31 By Gregory Dolganov , Susan Bort , Michael Lovett , John Burr , Lisa Schubert , Douglas Short , Mary McGurn , Christine Gibson , and David B. Lewis interleukin-13 ( IL-13 ) and IL-4 are cytokines produced by T cells that are encoded by the g23-31 region of human chromosome 5 .
To investigate the regulation of IL-13 gene expression by T cells , we isolated and sequenced the human IL-13 gene , analyzed its 5'-flanking region for potential transcriptional activation elements , and examined its expression in nontransformed T-lineage cell populations .
The human IL-13 gene was located 12.5-kb upstream of the IL-4 gene and 2-kb downstream of a CpG island .
The IL-13 gene 5 ' flank region included a segment with sequence homology to P elements of the IL-4 promoter involved in transcriptional activation in T cells .
Mutation of the IL-13 P element site significantly reduced IL-13 promoter activity in response to T-cell activation .
Oligonucleotides containing the IL-13 or UMAN T CELLS produce a number of cytokines that are important regulators of the immune response .
!
Many of these proteins are encoded on chromosome 5q23-31 , including interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-9 , IL-13 , and - granulocyte-macrophage - colony-stimulating - factor ( GM-CSF ) , * `` whereas others , such as IL-2 and interferon-y ( IFN-y ) , are encoded on chromosomes 4 and 6 , respec-tively . ``
IL-13 was first reported as a cytokine transcript preferentially expressed by murine T-cell clones of the Th ; type , ie , producing IL-4 but not IL-2 or IFN-y , and was originally called p600.°° Although the human IL-4 and IL-13 genes are only about 20 % to 30 % homologous at the amino acid level , `` `` they share a striking number of key immunoregulatory effects .
Other than IL-4 , IL-13 is the only cytokine known that promotes IgE isotype switching by human B cells in the absence of other cytokines . ``
Both IL-13 and IL-4 promote growth and differentiation of normal human B cells and monocytes , `` inhibit cytotoxicity and the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes , ' `` `` ° and increase surface expression of the adhesion molecule vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) on endothelial cells . ``
However , IL-13 and IL-4 also differ in their effects From Genelabs Incorporated , Redwood City , CA ; the Departments of Pediatrics and Immunology , University of Washington , Seattle , WA ; and the Department of Biochemistry and the McDermott Center , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX .

0006-497 3316 IL-4 P element sites specifically bound the transcriptional activator protein , nuclear factor-activated T cells , preformed { NF-ATp ) , when incubated with nuclear protein extracts from activated T cells .
Similar to IL-4 , IL-13 mRNA expression was highest in T-cell populations enriched for cells that had previously been primed in vivo or in vitro , indicating that priming increases the expression of the IL-13 and IL-4 genes in a coordinate manner .
Because the primed T cells contain higher levels of nuclear NF-ATp , capable of binding to P elements of the IL-4 and IL-13 promoters , than do freshly-isolated T ceils , the NF-AT-binding P elements are attractive candidates to mediate the coordinate expression of these two cytokine genes .

on certain cell types .
For example , IL-4 , but not IL-13 , promotes the growth of human T-cell blasts and clones , a finding that may be explained by the lack of high-affinity IL-13 receptors on T-lineage cells . ``
Human IL-13 enhances the production of IFN-y from natural killer cells by itself or in conjunction with IL-2 treatment , whereas IL-4 is inhibitory in this situation .
`` !
IL-13 , but not IL-4 , synergizes with GM-CSF in promoting colony formation by hematopoietic progenitor cells . ``
Thus , although there is considerable overlap in the effects of IL-4 and IL-13 , each cytokine may also have a distinct role in regulating T-cell-mediated immune responses .
How IL-13 expression by T cells is controlled at the cellular and molecular level is poorly understood .
Previous work has shown that IL-13 mRNA accumulation is induced in peripheral blood CD4 T cells by treatment with anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies ( MoAbs ) and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) . ``
IL-13 and IL-4 mRNA are both expressed at high levels in some murine CD4 Th ; -type clones® and in a human CD4 T-cell clone of the Th , - type ( ie , simultaneously expressing IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-y ) , `` suggesting that both cytokine genes might use common or similar mechanisms for transcription .
However , the temporal pattern of IL-13 and IL-4 mRNA expression differ in the lung tissue of mice infected with the Schistsoma mansoni , `` indicating that expression of these two cytokine genes can be independently regulated under some conditions in vivo .
Previous physical mapping of the human IL-13 gene by our group* and others `` has shown that it is located in proximity to the IL-4 and IL-5 genes in the 5q23-31 region .
To begin to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating IL-13 gene expression by T cells , we have isolated and sequenced the human IL-13 gene , determined its precise physical location with respect to the IL-4 gene , analyzed its 5 `` flanking region for potential transcriptional activation elements , and have examined its expression by nontransformed human T-lineage cell populations .

* `` `` Human chromosome 5-specific cell hybrids , `` `` IL-4-and IL-5-containing yeast artificial chromosomes , `` and chromosome 5-specific cosmids** were analyzed by Southern blotting using these cDNAs as probes .
These materials or human genomic DNA were also analyzed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using primers derived from clone 50-1 ( coding strand primer , 5 TGGCGC-TTTTGTTGACCAC ; noncoding strand primer , SACAGTACAT-GCCAGCTGTCA ) and clone 156 ( coding strand primer , 5'-CACTGGGCCCCATGGCGCTTT ; noncoding strand primer , under standard conditions at an annealing temperature of 50°C .
A 6.95-kb BamHUBamHI fragment of the human IL-13 gene was subcloned from cosmid 58D9 ( Fig 1 ) into the vector pBS ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) to create clone 10.4 and was sequenced .
Genomic or cDNA sequencing was performed for both strands of each clone using T7 Sequenase 2.0 kits following the manufacturer 's instructions ( US Biochemical , Cleveland , OH ) .
Sequence assembly and analysis were performed using a software package ( Intelligenetics , Mountain View , CA ) .
A portion of the DNA sequence obtained has previously been identified as the human IL-13 gene by others . ``
'' Human IL-13 promoter reporter gene constructs and transfection .
A 0.98-kb segment of the human IL-13 5° flank region spanning -940 to +48 in relation to the transcription start site was amplified by PCR from the human IL-13 genomic clone 10.2 using the primers 5'AGATGGATCCCAGAGACTGGTGAGCAAA ( coding strand ) and ( noncoding strand ) and Vent polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) .
To facilitate subcloning BamHI and HindIII restriction sites were included in the 5 ' region of the coding strand and noncoding strand primers , respectively .
The PCR product was gel-purified using Suprec columns following the manufacturer 's instructions ( Takara , Berkeley , CA ) , was digested with BamHI and HindIII , and was subcloned into the luciferase reporter gene vector , pGL-2 Basic ( Promega , Madison , WD ) , to create the final plasmid , pIL-13/luc .
PCR by overlap extension `` was used to mutate pIL-13/luc at the P element site at -128 to -119 from the sequence GTGGAAAATC to GATATCAATC ( the sequence of the noncoding strand is shown , with the mutated residues indicated in bold ) .
The final mutant PCR product was subcloned into pGL-2 basic to create pIL-l3mut/luc using the same methods as for the pIL-13//uc construct .
DNA sequencing excluded the presence of any PCR-related errors in the final constructs .
The plasmid pCMV//uc ( pEQ-176 ) , in which transcription of a luciferase cDNA is driven by the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) immediate early gene promoter , `` `` served as a positive con-trol .
Large-scale preparations of these plasmids were prepared using Nucleobond Ax columns ( Nest Group , Southboro , MA ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
For each construct , 10 ug of plasmid DNA was electroporated into 12 x 10° Jurkat thymoma cells ( pro-vided by Dr C. Wilson , University of Washington , Seattle , WA ) in 0.4 mL of RPMI with 10 % fetal calf serum medium using 4-mm electroporation cuvettes and an Electro Cell Manipulator 600 electro-porator ( BTX , San Diego , CA ) at settings of 260 V and 1,050 micro-farads .
Cells were then diluted to a concentration of 1 x 10°/mL in fresh medium and placed at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator for 6 hours .
After incubation , aliquots of cells were stimulated with 6.5 pg/mL concanavalin A ( Con A ; Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) and 10 ng/mL PMA ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) or were left untreated for an additional 16 hours at 37°C .
Where indicated , cyclosporin A ( CsA ; Sandoz , Basel , Switzerland ) was added 1 hour before stimulation at a final concentration of 500 ng/mL .
Cells were then harvested by centrifugation , washed in phosphate-buffered saline , dissolved in reporter lysis buffer ( Promega , Madison , WI ) as directed by the manufacturer , and stored at -80°C until assayed .
Lysates were thawed to room temperature , diluted 5-fold in luciferase assay buffer ( Promega ) , and analyzed in duplicate for luciferase activity for 30 seconds using a Monolight 1500 luminometer ( Analytical Luminescence Laboratory , San Diego , CA ) .

3318 mononuclear cells ( WMC 's ) were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and treated with CD4 Lymphokwik ( One Lambda , Los Angeles , CA ) , a proprietary mixture of complement and MoAbs directed against non-T-lineage and CD8 surface markers , following the manufacturer 's instructions .
The CD45RA~ ( CD45RO* ) cell subset was purified from adult CD4 T cells using anti-CD45RA MoAb , 3AC5* , and an indirect panning technique to deplete CD4SRA * cells as previously described . ``
' The final purity of each T-lineage cell population was routinely greater than 95 % pure based on flow cytometric analysis after staining with appropriate MoAbs .
To prime CD4 T cells in vitro , freshly isolated adult CD4 T cells were placed at 1 to 2 x 10 % /mL into 12-well flat bottom plates ( Corning , Corning , NY ) .
Each well contained 1 to 2 x 10° % /mL irradiated adult WMC 's ( 30 Gy ) in 2 mL of CT.4S medium `` supplemented with 3.1 ug/mL of Con A , 0.5 ng/mL of PMA , 5 U/ mL purified human IL-2 ( Boehringer-Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) , and 5 ng/mL of recombinant human IL-2 ( kindly provided by Dr K. Grabstein , Immunex Corp , Seattle , WA ) .
Overlying medium ( 0.5 mL ) was replaced with an equal volume of fresh CT.4S medium supplemented with 5 U/mL of IL-2 every 3 days .
Viable cells were harvested by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation after 2 to 3 weeks .
To isolate T-cell clones by direct limiting dilution , purified adult or neonatal CD4 T cells were seeded at 1 or 5 cells per well into 96-well round bottom plates ( Corning ) .
Each well contained 100,000 irradiated adult WMCs ( 30 Gy ) in CT.4S medium supplemented with 3.1 ug/mL of Con A , 0.5 ng/mL of PMA , 5 U/mL purified human IL-2 , and 5 ng/mL of recombinant human IL-2 .
Overlying medium ( 0.1 mL ) was replaced with an equal volume of fresh CT.4S medium supplemented with 5 U/mL of IL-2 every 3 to 5 days .
After 3 to 4 weeks , growth-positive wells were scored microscopically and expanded in 12-well tissue culture plates by restimulation with Con A , IL-2 , and irradiated WMCs every 2 to 3 weeks .
Wells with growth after seeding with 5 cells were expanded only if less than 20 % of such wells scored positive .
Viable clone cells were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and were extensively washed before use .
Cell activation , .
- Cells were activated at 5 X 10 % /mL in RPMI medium supplemented with 5 % human AB serum as previously described `` ' using 50 ng/mL PMA in combination with either 25 ug/ mL Con A or 0.5 pmol/L ionomycin ( Calbiochem-Behring , San Diego , CA ) .
We used these two activation conditions because they reliably induced high levels of IL-13 mRNA , whereas other stimuli , such as anti-CD3 MoAb in combination with PMA , were much less effective ( data not shown ) .
Nuclear protein preparations and electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) .
_ CD4 T cells previously primed in vitro for 2 to 3 weeks were stimulated for 2 hours with Con A ( 25 ng/mL ) and PMA ( 25 ng/mL ) , and nuclear proteins were extracted as described by Penix et al . ``
'' Nuclear protein extracts ( 3 to 4 ug ) were preincu-bated at room temperature with buffer ( 10 mmol/L Tris [ pH 7.5 ] , 50 mmol/L NaCl , 1 mmol/L EDTA , 5 % glycerol , 1 mmoV/L dithio-threitol , 2 mmol/L pefabloc [ Boehringer-Mannheim ] , 2 pg/mL pep-statin A [ Calbiochem ] , and 1 ug of polydI-dC [ Pharmacia ] ) and oligonucleotide competitors for 10 minutes .
Probe ( 2 x 10° cpm ) was then added to a final volume of 25 LL , and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 minutes at room temperature .
In some reactions , the nuclear protein was incubated with 1 L of rabbit antisera raised against the NF-ATp peptide 72 `` ( QLVPAIPICSIPV-TASLPPLEWPLSNQ ) for 30 minutes on ice before the addition of probe .
In some cases , the antisera were first incubated with 0.5 uL ( 500 ng ) of either peptide 72 or with , as a negative control , another NF-ATp-derived peptide , peptide 48 `` ( SAHELPMVERQDMDS-CLVYGGQQ ) for 30 minutes on ice before the addition of nuclear protein .

Oligonucleotides for EMSAs .
- Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( Seattle , WA ) .
The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes and unlabeled competitors ( in each case , only the noncoding strand is shown ) : hIL-4 promoter P1 element ( -66 to -82 with respect to the transcription start site ) , `` ATTGGAAATTTTCGTTA ; mutant hIL-4 promoter PI element , ATTATAAATTTTCGTTA ; hIL-13 promoter P element-like site ( -134 to -149 ) , TGTGGAAAATCCAGTG ; mutant hIL-13 promoter P element-like site , TGTGGTCAATC-CAGTG .
Residues that are mutated from the wild-type sequences are indicated in bold .
For each probe used in EMSA , complementary oligonucleotide strands were separately end-labeled with y-*P-aden-osine triphosphate using T4 kinase and were annealed , and the double-stranded probe was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophore-sis using 10 % nondenaturing gels .
RNA blotting and hybridization .
- Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/CsCl method `` `` or by the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method `` `` using a commercial kit ( Trireagent ; Molecular Research Center , Cincinnati , OH ) .
RNA was blotted , hybridized with `` P-labeled RNA or DNA probes , and washed as previously described . ``
The full-length human IL-2 , IL-4 , and elongation factor-la ( EF-1 @ ) probes have been described . ``
The human IL-13 cDNA probe was derived from a full-length cDNA clone , p50 , and consisted of nucleotides 11 to 263 . ``
All probes consisted of DNA labeled by the random hexamer priming method `` `` using a commercial kit ( Pharmacia ) , with the exception of the IL-4 probe , for which a single-stranded RNA probe was used . ``
RESULTS Organization of human IL-13 and IL-4 genes .
We have previously reported the isolation of several human cDNA clones highly homologous to the cytokine encoded by the murine IL-13 ( p600 ) cDNA using a direct selection method .
* Using these cDNAs as probes , we isolated two human cosmids that each encompass the IL-13 and IL-4 genetic loci ( Fig 1 ) .
Mapping using restriction enzymes showed that the IL-13 and IL-4 genes were separated by about 12 kb .
A 6.95-kb BamHI fragment containing the IL-13 gene was subcloned from one of these cosmids , 58D9 , and was completely sequenced .
* This showed that a CpG island , based on its high G/C content , `` `` was located 2-kb upstream of the IL-13 transcription start site ( Figs 1 and 2 ) .
Based on restriction mapping with rare cutting endonucleases , we did not find evidence of any additional CpG island regions in cosmid 58D9 ( data not shown ) .
Our results are consistent with those previously reported for the human IL-13 cDNA `` and for a more limited region of the human IL-13 gene . ``
The human IL-13 gene had a 4-exon-3-intron structure found in the IL-4 gene and most other T-cell-derived cytokines ( Fig 1 ) .
In agreement with the results of others , `` `` we found that the predicted 3 ' untranslated region of IL-13 mRNA contained multiple AUUA sequences ( data not shown ) that have been observed in all T-cell-derived cytokine genes to date and appear to confer mRNA instability . ``
Our analysis also showed that the human IL-13 and IL-4 genes are in the same * This sequence is available via Genebank Accession No .

3320 Previous work by others has identified a purine-rich se-quence , termed the P element , in the 5 ' flank region of the murine and human IL-4 genes that is critical for their transcription . ``
`` * P elements bind proteins of the NF-AT transcription factor family in vitro . ``
An analysis of the human IL-13 gene 's 5 flank region showed a purine-rich sequence similar to that of the human IL-4 P element , PI ( see legend to Fig 2 ) .
To test the functional importance of this putative P element , we first established that a segment of the IL-13 5 ' flank region , from -940 to +48 , was sufficient to confer transcription of a reporter gene in response to T-cell activation using the construct pIL-13//uc .
We found that Jurkat thymoma cells constitutively expressed low amounts of IL-13 transcripts that increased approximately 5- to 10-fold after stimulation with Con A and PMA ( data not shown ) .
We used this cell line to test the activity of IL-13 promoter constructs in response to T-cell activation .
Promoter activity of pIL-13/luc in unstimulated Jurkat cells was similar to the background levels of those observed with a promoterless luciferase plasmid , pGL-2 ( Fig 3 ) .
After activation with Con A and PMA , IL-13 promoter activity increased approximately 100- to 300-fold above the levels observed in unstimulated cells .
Under these conditions , the activity of the CMV immediate early gene promoter , a strong and constitutively active promoter , increased only about 5-fold in response to stimulation .
This suggested that the marked increase in IL-13 promoter activity in response to stimulation was not merely because of cell activation increasing the proportion of cells containing reporter plasmids at the time of harvest .
IL-13 expression by T cells is inhibited by CsA , `` and a variety of evidence suggests that NF-AT transcriptional activator proteins are major targets for the inhibition of cytokine gene transcription by CsA . ``
Treatment of Jurkat cells with CsA reduced the increase in reporter gene activity of pIL-13/luc after Con A and PMA treatment by approximately 80 % ( Fig 3 ) .
A construct containing a 5-bp substitution mutation of the IL-13 promoter P element ( pIL-13mut/ luc ) also reduced promoter activity in stimulated Jurkat T cells by approximately 80 % .
This construct was mutated in the GGAA residues that others have shown to be critical for transcriptional activation by IL-4 P elements and for binding of NF-AT proteins . ``
These results suggest that the P element is essential for transcription of the IL-13 gene in response to T-cell activation , and that the CsA-sensitive NF-AT family of proteins are likely candidates for mediating transcriptional activation via this element .
CsA treatment of stimulated Jurkat cells transfected with pIL-13mut/luc reduced residual promoter activity by approximately 50 % , as compared with that obtained with stimulated Jurkat cells and pIL-13mut//uc without CsA .
Thus , a portion of IL-13 promoter activity may be mediated by CsA-resistant transcription factors .
The IL-13 P element binds the transcriptional activator protein NF-ATp .
- Using EMSA , we compared oligonucleotides containing either the putative IL-13 P element or the human IL-4 P1 element for their binding of nuclear proteins contained in activated T cells .

As shown in Fig 4A , and in agreement with previous work by others , `` a radiolabeled probe for the human IL-4 gene P element , P1 , formed a complex with nuclear protein purified from this CD4 T-cell population .
This complex was specific in that it was effectively competed with an unlabeled IL-4 promoter oligonucleotide but not by an IL-4 P1 mutant oligonucleotide .
The oligonucleotide containing the P-ele-ment-like sequence from the human IL-13 promoter effectively competed with the human IL-4 PI probe for specific protein binding ( Fig 4A , lane 4 ) .

- Gel-shift assays for nuclear proteins binding to the human IL-4 P1 and the putative human IL-13 P element oligonucleotides .
Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from in vitro-primed adult T cells activated for 2 hours with Con A and PMA .
Where indicated , unlabeled oligonucleotides were added at a 50-fold molar excess relative to the probe in competition reactions .

Specific antiserum to NF-ATp was added to lanes 6-8 , alone ( lane 6 ) , in the presence of the NF-ATp peptide to which the antiserum was raised ( lane 7 ) , or in the presence of an irrelevant peptide ( lane 8 ) .
1 ) .
This complex was specific in that it was efficiently competed by unlabeled IL-13 oligonucleotide but not by an IL-13 mutant oligonucleotide .
The human IL-4 P1 element oligonucleotide was also an effective competitor for protein binding to the IL-13 probe .
Furthermore , the mutant IL-4 P1 oligonucleotide that was ineffective in blocking nuclear protein complex formation with the IL-4 P1 element ( Fig 4B , lane 3 ) was also ineffective in competition with the IL-13 probe .
The majority of the IL-13 oligonucleotide-protein complex was efficiently supershifted by NF-ATp antiserum ( Fig 4B , lane 6 ) , as was the complex formed with the human IL-4 P1 probe ( data not shown ) .
Inclusion of the specific NF-ATp peptide to which the antiserum was raised prevented this supershift ( lane 7 ) , whereas inclusion of an equal amount of irrelevant peptide did not ( lane 8 ) .
Therefore , the IL-4 P1 and IL-13 P element oligonucleotides had similar or identical binding specificity for nuclear proteins from activated CD4 T cells that had been primed in vitro .
We also 3321 observed this NF-ATp-containing complex with the IL-13 or IL-4 P element oligonucleotides when freshly-isolated adult CD4 T cells that had been polyclonally activated for 2 hours were used as a source of nuclear protein .
However , the amount of complex under these conditions was only about one tenth that observed when primed CD4 T-cell protein extracts were used with either the IL-4 `` or the IL-13 P element probes ( data not shown ) .
Together , these results show a striking correlation between the abundance of nuclear protein binding to the human IL-13 and human IL-4 P elements and the capacity of T cells to express the IL-13 and IL-4 genes .
In addition , a major component of nuclear protein binding to these P elements in activated adult CD4 T cells was NF-ATp .
IL-13 mRNA expression by human T-cell populations .
To gain insight into the cellular mechanisms regulating IL-13 gene expression , we compared IL-13 , IL-4 , and IL-2 mRNA expression by a variety of normal human T-cell populations after polyclonal activation .
We first examined the kinetics of IL-13 transcript expression by circulating freshly isolated adult human T cells ( Fig 5 , lanes 1-4 ) .
IL-13 transcripts were undetectable in unstimulated cells but were observed after activation with Con A and PMA , with peak levels achieved at approximately 6 hours of incubation .
The kinetics of IL-2 and IL-4 mRNA accumulation after activation was similar to that observed for IL-13 transcripts .
Levels of transcripts for all three cytokines were typically low to Cell type : Con A + PMA ( hrs ) : O0 _ 6 1 = co4* co4sRA® Probe : IL-13 IL-4 IL-2 EF Fig 5 .

3322 undetectable at 24 hours of incubation .
The amount of transcripts for EF-la , an abundant '*housekeeping'* gene product involved in protein translation , `` was similar in all lanes , indicating that the differences in cytokine mRNA levels observed at different time points were not caused by differences in the amount of total RNA loaded per lane .
Similar kinetics of cytokine mRNA accumulation were also observed for the IL-13 , IL-4 , and IL-2 genes when adult T cells were stimulated with the combination of ionomycin and PMA ( data not shown ) .
Circulating CD4 T cells from healthy adults are comprised of two mutually exclusive subsets identified by their reciprocal surface expression of the CD4SRA and CD4SRO isoforms of the CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase molecule .
`` * `` `` To determine if IL-13 was differentially expressed by CD4 T cells based on their surface expression of CD45 isoforms , cytokine mRNA expression by the CD4S5RA~ ( CD4S5RO* ) and unfractionated CD4 T cells were compared after their activation in vitro .
CD4S5RA~CD4 T cells were highly enriched in IL-13 mRNA as compared with unfractionated CD4 T cells ( Fig 5 , lane 5 v lane 6 ) .
In agreement with previous results , `` `` an enrichment for IL-4 mRNA expression by CD45RA~CD4 T cells was also ob-served .
Depending on the donor used , IL-2 mRNA levels in CD45SRA ~CD4 T cells ranged from being substantially lower ( Fig 5 ) or similar to that in unfractionated CD4 T cells `` .
In contrast , the enrichment for IL-4 and IL-13 mRNA expression by CD45RA~CD4 T cells as compared with that by unfractionated CD4 T cells was consistent in all four blood donors we examined ( data not shown ) .
A variety of evidence suggests that circulating CD4SRO* T cells represent a population that has previously been activated or ' `` `` primed `` ' in vivo by antigen .
`` `` `` * `` ° Taken together with the results above , this suggests that priming of T cells preferentially upregulates IL-13 but not IL-2 gene expression .
Two predictions of this model are that ( 1 ) IL-13 mRNA expression should be low to undetectable in T-cell populations that have had limited exposure to antigens , such as neonatal T cells , and ( 2 ) priming of these antigenically naive populations by repetitive activation in vitro should upregu-late expression of the IL-13 gene but not of the IL-2 gene .
To test these predictions , freshly-isolated neonatal T cells , adult T cells , and several clones derived from neonatal CD4 T cells or adult CD4 T cells were compared for their expression of IL-13 , IL-4 , and IL-2 mRNA after activation in vitro .
IL-13 was undetectable in freshly isolated neonatal T cells , whereas adult T cells routinely contained substantial levels of IL-13 transcripts under these conditions ( Fig 6 ) .
In agreement with previous published results , `` `` the pattern of IL-4 mRNA expression by neonatal T cells was , similar to IL-13 mRNA expression , low to undetectable , whereas , in contrast , the level of IL-2 transcripts in neonatal T cells was similar to that in adult T cells .
These selective deficits in cytokine expression by neonatal T cells as compared with that by adult T cells were observed after activation with either Con A and PMA or with ionomycin and PMA ( data not shown ) .
Unlike freshly isolated cells , neonatal CD4 T cells propagated in vitro as clones expressed high levels of IL-13 and IL-4 transcripts ( Fig 6 ) .

expression by individual clones was either similar , or only modestly increased , as compared with that found in freshly-isolated cells .
These neonatal clones were of the Th , type in that they also expressed significant amounts of IFN-y mRNA ( data not shown ) .
We also observed marked increases in the expression of the IL-13 and IL-4 genes , but not of the IL-2 gene , in neonatal or adult CD4 T cells that were primed in vitro in bulk for 10 to 14 days and were then restimulated ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION We and others have shown physical linkage for at least five cytokine genes in 5q23-31 , `` ° `` `` including IL-13 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-3 , GM-CSF , and IL-9 .
This close physical linkage is also confirmed by synteny studies in mice that indicate that these cytokines map to mouse chromosome 11.2 A comparison of the different chromosome 5 cytokine genes with each other shows similar exon sizes and exon-intron struc-ture , some limited DNA sequence homology in their 5 ' flank regulatory regions , and some limited amino acid homology in their N- and C-terminal regions . ``
However , with the exception of the IL-4 and IL-13 genes , most of the coding sequences of this cytokine cluster show little sequence homology with one another .
Therefore , these genes , as a group , do not appear to be clustered because of recent gene duplica- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

COEXPRESSION OF IL-4 AND IL-13 tion events .
Although it is unclear why all of these cytokine genes have remained clustered during evolution , the contiguity of the IL-3 and GM-CSF genes ( 10 kb apart in the human and 14 kb apart in the mouse ) may be explained by their sharing an enhancer segment located between the two genes .
`` * `` ° The fact that the human IL-13 and IL-4 genes are located a similar distance apart ( 12 kb ) raises the possibility that these two cytokine genes might also share an enhancer element .
The finding of a CpG island 2 kb upstream from the human IL-13 gene is unexpected in that CpG islands have not been previously observed in the regions flanking the genes that encode other T-cell-derived cytokines , including IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , GM-CSF , and IFN-y .
CpG islands have been implicated in maintenance of an open chromatin configuration that may facilitate gene transcription . ``
Further studies will be required to establish that the CpG island proximal to the IL-13 and IL-4 genetic loci influence their transcriptional activation in vivo .
The contiguity of the IL-4 and IL-13 genes that we have shown here , their significant genetic homology , `` and , based on an analysis of murine CD4 T-cell clones , their tendency to be coordinately expressed* `` suggested that the promoters of these cytokines genes might use similar cis-regulatory elements .
Although we only found about 20 % sequence homology between the IL-13 and IL-4 promoter regions over the first 2 kb 5 ' of the transcription start site ( data not shown ) , we identified a purine-rich sequence in the IL-13 promoter homologous to the P elements of the IL-4 gene .
Our results using transiently transfected reporter gene constructs show that this element significantly contributes to IL-13 promoter activity in response to T-cell activation .
We found that this IL-13 P element was similar to the IL-4 promoter P1 element in specifically binding in vitro the transcription activator protein , NF-ATp .
In addition , we have found a striking direct correlation in normal human T-lineage cell populations between the amount of NF-ATp in the nucleus after activation and the capacity of T cells to express IL-4 `` and IL-13 mRNA ( D. Lewis and S. Bort , manuscript in preparation ) .
NF-AT protein translocation from the cytoplasm to nucleus in response to T-cell activation is inhibited by CsA® .
Therefore , our finding that IL-13 promoter activity in response to stimulation was markedly inhibited by CsA supports the idea that NF-AT proteins may play a role in IL-13 transcription by T cells in vivo .
Together , our results are consistent with a model in which the availability of NF-ATp for binding to these two cytokine genes could be an important determinant of the efficiency with which they are transcribed .
In a number of T-cell-derived cytokine promoters , including that for the IL-4 gene , NF-AT-binding P elements have been shown to interact with adjacent AP-1 binding sites in activating transcription . ``
Whether this is true for the P element site of the IL-13 gene that we have identified remains to be determined .
Our finding that a modest portion of IL-13 promoter activity persisted in Jurkat cells treated with CsA and transfected with an IL-13 promoter construct in which the P element site was mutated is consistent with a role for transcription factors other than NF-AT proteins in directing IL-13 gene 3323 transcription .
A number of other transcription factors besides NF-ATp and AP-1 , including HMG-1 , NF-Y , and octamer proteins , have been reported to bind to cis-elements in the IL-4 5 ' flank region** `` ' and , therefore , are candidates to regulate IL-4 gene transcription .
Because there are potential binding sites for these and other DNA binding proteins in the human IL-13 5 `` flank region ( data not shown ) , it will be of interest to determine if these proteins also play a role in the transcriptional regulation of the IL-13 gene .
We found that the human IL-13 and IL-4 genes were coordinately expressed by various human T-cell populations , both in bulk and at the clonal level , but the molecular mechanisms by which this is achieved remain unclear .
The temporal patterns of IL-13 , IL-4 , and IL-2 mRNA accumulation after T-cell activation were similar , with peak levels achieved for all three cytokine transcripts at approximately 6 hours of incubation .
By 24 hours of incubation , transcript levels for all three cytokine genes were very low to undetect-able .
These results differ from those of Zurawski and de Vries `` who reported that human T-cell clones activated in vitro had detectable IL-13 mRNA levels for up to 72 hours after activation , long after IL-4 mRNA had decreased to undetectable levels .
Whether these differences reflect the particular T-cell populations studied ( freshly isolated T cells versus clones ) or the stimulus used for activation remains to be determined .
Based on studies of IL-2 gene expression by T cells , `` it is likely that the transient wave of IL-13 and IL-4 mRNA accumulation that we observed after activation in vitro is cause , in part , by the relatively short period during which these cytokine genes are transcribed ( D. Lewis , unpublished observations ) .
In addition , the transient accumulation of IL-13 may also be explained by the fact that the IL-13 transcript , similar to those for IL-4 `` and IL-2 , `` contains AUUUA sequences in the 3 ' untranslated region that appear to decrease mRNA stability . ``
The current study also shows that expression of the IL-13 and IL-2 genes in freshly isolated human T cells is independently modulated .
Among adult CD4 T cells , the CD45RA~ ( CD45RO* ) subset was highly enriched in the capacity to express IL-13 mRNA and , in agreement with results of earlier results , `` `` IL-4 mRNA , whereas the expression of IL-2 transcripts was not enhanced .
The CD4SRA* and CD45RO+* subsets comprise approximately 60 % and 40 % , respectively , of circulating adult CD4 T cells .
`` * `` `` The CD45RO* subset is highly enriched in functional memory T cells , defined by their enhanced responses to recall anti-gens .
`` * `` ° These enhanced responses are presumed to be a result of previous activation and expansion of this cell population in vivo in response to cognate antigen . ``
'' `` `` CD45RA * cells may serve as the precursors of the primed population , although this remains a point of controversy . ``
Our findings suggest that the IL-13 gene and IL-4 genes are similar in that priming of T cells in vivo appears to upregu-late their capacity to express these two cytokines but does not enhance IL-2 gene expression .
The lack of detectable IL-13 or IL-4 mRNA expression by neonatal T cells , a cell population that presumably has had insignificant exposure to foreign antigen , is also consistent with a model in which high levels of IL-13 and IL-4 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

3324 gene expression depend on previous T-cell activation in vivo .
The surface phenotype of neonatal T cells is greater than 95 % CD45RA*CD4S5RO~ , `` again suggesting that this pattern of surface expression of CD45 isoforms identifies T-cell populations that are antigenically naive .
Because IL-2 expression by neonatal T cells was similar to or greater than that by adult T cells , the low level of IL-13 mRNA expression by this cell type can not be attributed to a global immaturity in its capacity to produce cytokines .
In addition , the observation that neonatal CD4 T-cell clones were routinely able to express high levels of IL-13 and IL-4 mRNA suggests that neonatal CD4 T cells are not intrinsically limited in their capacity to express these cytokines and , under suitable conditions of priming in vitro and , presumably , in vivo , can acquire the capacity to express both IL-13 and IL-4 at high levels similar to those found in adult CD4 T-cell clones .
The markedly higher levels of IL-13 and IL-4 mRNA in adult CD4 T-cell clones compared with those in freshly isolated adult T cells suggests that priming in vitro is also a potent inducer in this cell population for an increased capacity to express these cytokines .
This priming model is supported by studies showing that , when circulating neonatal T cells or adult CD45SRA*CD4 T cells are propagated in bulk for short periods of time in vitro , their capacity to express IL-4 mRNA is increased , whereas IL-2 gene expression remains un-changed . ``
'' In summary , we have found that the IL-13 and IL-4 genes are located a short distance apart , increasing the possibility that these two cytokines may share common regulatory regions , such as an enhancer .
It is plausible that additional coregulated cytokine genes may reside in this already cyto-kine-rich region of the human genome .
The IL-13 and IL-4 promoters appear to both use NF-AT-binding P elements for their transcriptional activation in response to T-cell activation .
Our results using untransformed human T-cell populations support the results of earlier studies of murine CD4 T-cell clones® `` showing that the IL-13 and IL-4 genes tend to be coordinately expressed after T-cell activation and indicate that prior activation , ie , priming , is required for either of these cytokines to be expressed at high levels by T cells .
Because NF-ATp binding activity to P elements is higher in primed T cells than that in freshly isolated T cells , the IL-13 and IL-4 P elements could mediate , at least in part , the coordinate expression of these two cytokines in activated T cells .
