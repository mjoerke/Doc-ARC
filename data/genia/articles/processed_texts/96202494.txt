The RAR-RXR as Well as the RXR-RXR Pathway Is Involved in Signaling Growth Inhibition of Human CD34* Erythroid Progenitor Cells By Leiv S. Rusten , Ingunn Dybedal , Heidi Kiil Blomhoff , Rune Blomhoff , Erlend B. Smeland , and Sten Eirik W. Jacobsen Previous studies have shown that retinoic acid ( RA ) , similar to tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) , can act as a bifunctional regulator of the growth of bone marrow progenitors , in that it can stimulate granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) - or interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) -induced GM colony formation , but potently inhibit G-CSF-induced growth .
The present study , using highly enriched human CD34* as well as Lin~ murine bone marrow progenitor cells , demonstrates a potent inhibitory effect of 9-cisRA on burst-form-ing unit-erythroid ( BFU-E ) colony formation regardless of the cytokine stimulating growth .
Specifically , 9-cis-RA potently inhibited the growth of BFU-E in response to erythropoietin ( Epo ) ( 100 % ) , stem cell factor ( SCF ) + Epo ( 92 % ) , IL-3 + Epo ( 97 % ) , IL-4 + Epo ( 88 % ) , and IL-9 + Epo ( 100 % ) .
Erythroid colony growth was also inhibited when CD34* progenitors were seeded at one cell per well , suggesting a direct action of RA .
Using synthetic ligands to retinoic acid receptors { RARs ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) that selectively bind ETINOL AND ITS derivatives ( retinoids ) have been shown to exert important effects in embryogenesis ' as well as in hematopoiesis . ``
Retinol is the major retinoid in plasma .
However , inside target cells retinol is oxidized to the active metabolite retinoic acid ( RA ) . ``
The signaling pathway of RA involves nuclear RA receptors ( RARa , # , y ) *~ and retinoid X receptors ( RXRa , # , y ) , ° all of which are members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfam-ily of ligand-dependent transcripion factors .
Recent evidence indicates that nuclear retinoid receptor dimers , of which RXR is a mandatory constituent , are required for effective activation of retinoid response pathways . ``
RAR-RXR heterodimers activate transcription in response to all-trans- or 9-cis-RA by binding to response elements in target genes consisting of two direct repeats of the consensus sequence AGGTCA spaced by 5 or 2 bp ( DR5 and DR2 elements , respectively ) , whereas RXR-RXR homodimers activate transcription in response to 9-cis-RA by binding to direct repeats spaced by 1 bp ( DR1 elements ) . ``
Thus , because the response element specificity of RAR-RXR heterodimers differs from that of RXR-RXR homodimers , two retinoid response pathways capable of activating distinct sets of genes are thought to exist . ``

Transactivation studies showed that both the RAR ( Ro 13-7410 ) and RXR ( Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386 ) ligands were highly selective at 100 nmol/L .
At this concentration , Ro 13-7410 potently inhibited G-CSF-stimulated myeloid as well as SCF + Epo-induced erythroid colony growth .
At the same concentration , Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386 had little or no effect on G-CSF-induced colony formation , whereas they inhibited 75 % and 53 % , respectively , of SCF + Epo-stimulated BFU-E colony growth .
Thus , the RAR-RXR response pathway can signal growth inhibition of normal bone marrow myeloid and erythroid progenitor cells .
In addition , we demonstrate a unique involvement of the RXR-RXR pathway in mediating growth inhibition of erythroid but not myeloid progenitor cells .

Vitamin A deficiency in humans and in experimental animal models is associated with anemia , indicating that retinoids are important in normal erythroid development . ``
'' However , in vitro studies have been inconclusive with regard to effects of retinoids on erythroid progenitor cells .
Whereas many previous studies have reported RA-induced enhancement of erythroid colony formation , `` '~ `` others have found inhibitory effects .
`` `` `` * RA has been demonstrated to be a bidirectional regulator of the growth of human granulocyte-macrophage ( GM ) progenitors .
The response elicited ( stimulatory or inhibitory ) is dependent in part on the specific growth factors with which RA interacts .
Specifically , RA has been shown to either have no effect or stimulate interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) - or GM-colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF GM colony formation , `` but to potently inhibit G-CSF-stimulated growth . ``
'' Similar studies addressing the direct and specific interactions of RA with different erythroid stimuli have not been performed .
Using highly purified human CD34* bone marrow ( BM ) cells as well as Lin~ murine BM progenitors , we show here that RA is a potent and direct inhibitor of erythropoiesis in vitro , regardless of the cytokines stimulating growth .
This effect can be signaled through the RAR-RXR as well as the RXR-RXR pathway .
In contrast , G-CSF-induced myeloid colony formation appears to be inhibited exclusively through the RAR-RXR response pathway .

RESULTS Effects of 9-cis-RA on erythroid colony formation by human BM CD34* cells .
Conflicting data have previously been reported with regard to effects of RA on erythroid progenitor cells .
Regardless of the isoform tested , several investigators found that RA could enhance Epo-induced burst-promoting activity . ``
'' Conversely , other studies have demonstrated inhibitory effects of RA on erythroid colony formation . ``
Whether the specific growth factors by which RA interacts can explain these different effects on erythroid progenitors has not previously been addressed .
In the present study , 9-cis-RA inhibited BFU-E colony formation of From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

1730 CD34* BM cells induced by multiple cytokine combinations ( Fig 1 ) .
Specifically , BFU-E colony growth induced by Epo alone or Epo in combination with IL-9 was completely inhibited by 9-cis-RA ( 100 nmol/L ) , whereas BFU-E colony formation stimulated by Epo + SCF , Epo + IL-3 , and Epo + IL-3 + IL-9 + SCF was inhibited by 92 % ( P < .05 ) , 97 % ( P < .05 ) , and 42 % ( P < .05 ) , respectively ( Fig 1 ) .
9-cis-RA inhibited BFU-E colony formation in a concentration-dependent fashion .
Fifty percent inhibition of Epo + SCF-stimulated colony growth occurred at a 9-cis-RA concentration of 1 to 10 nmol/L , whereas complete inhibition of erythroid colony-forming ability was observed at 1,000 nmol/L ( Fig 2 ) .
In comparison , 50 % inhibition of SCF + IL-3 + IL-9 + Epo-induced BFU-E colony growth was observed at a 9-cis-RA concentration of 100 nmol/L , and an inhibition of 86 % occurred at 1,000 nmol/L ( Fig 2 ) .
Although CD34 * cells represent a highly enriched population of hematopoietic progenitor cells , there is still considerable heterogeneity within the CD34* cell compartment .
Therefore , indirect effects through cytokine production from accessory cells can not be excluded when effects of RA are studied using CD34* cells at high density .
However , no previous study has determined whether effects of RA on erythroid progenitors are directly mediated .
In the present study , the effect of 9-cis-RA ( 100 nmol/L ) on SCF + Epo-stimulated erythroid colony formation of CD34* progenitor cells plated at 1 cell per well were examined .
In agreement with the colony assays , 9-cis-RA inhibited SCF + Epo-induced erythroid colony formation of single CD34* cells by 96 % ( P < .05 ; Fig 3 ) , suggesting a direct inhibitory effect of 9-cis-RA .
To determine whether 9-cis-RA also could affect the differentiation of erythroid progenitors , CD34* cells were grown in SCF + Epo in the presence or absence of 9-cisRA ( 10 nmol/L ) for 1 or 2 weeks , and cytospin preparations from three separate experiments were analyzed morphologi- 100 C Epo e I it-9+Epo 5 gy E scr+Epo 8 - so # iL-3+Epo g Z p IL-3+|:9 & 401 é +SCF+Epo 8 , g `` 1 Z 9-cis-RA Fig 1 .

cally .
After 1 week , the proportion of terminally differentiated erythroblasts characterized by pyknotic nuclei was 17 % + 3 % in control cultures and 30 % + 5 % in the presence of 9-cis-RA .
Similarly , after 2 weeks ' incubation in the absence or presence of 9-cis-RA , 52 % + 10 % and 80 % *+ 5 % of the cells , respectively , were terminally differentiated erythro-blasts .
Thus , although 9-cis-RA inhibited total cell proliferation ( data not shown ) , it did not inhibit the production of end-stage erythroblasts in those clones that proliferated in the presence of RA .
Effects of 9-cis-RA on erythroid colony formation by murine Lin~ BM cells .
In a previous study , we have shown a potent and direct inhibitory effect of 9-cis- and all-trans-RA on the proliferation and differentiation of primitive Lin~ Sca-1* murine progenitor cells . ``
Here we show that RA also inhibits colony formation of committed erythroid progenitors in murine BM .
Specifically , 9-cis-RA ( 1 umol/L ) inhibited BFU-E colony formation stimulated by rmIL-4 + Epo , TSCF + Epo , and rmIL-3 + Epo by 88 % , 89 % , and 78 % , respectively ( Table 1 ) .
Thus , as in the human system , RA can inhibit murine in vitro erythropoiesis stimulated by multiple cytokine combinations .
The inhibitory effects of RA on CD34* BFU-E are not mediated through TGF-L or TNF-a .
- Although the results of single-cell cloning experiments suggested a direct action of RA on the progenitor cells , this assay can not show effects mediated via autocrine loops .

Furthermore , because the effects of TNF- « on hematopoiesis , mainly mediated through TNFR55 , *** partially mimic those of RA in that it potently inhibits erythroid colony formation as well as G-CSF-induced proliferation , we also investigated whether endogeneous TNFR55-mediated signaling might be involved in mediating the effects of 9-cis-RA .
TGF-8 , ( 0.2 ng/mL ) inhibited SCF + Epo-induced BFU-E colony growth by 79 % , and this effect could be abrogated by the addition of a neutralizing anti-TGF-8 antibody ( 2 ug/mL ; Fig 4A ) .

The results are given as relative transcriptional activity normalized to the value of the medium control { one of three reproducible experiments ) .

Involvement of RAR-RXR and RXR-RXR response pathways in mediating RA-induced effects on hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC ) .
9-cis-RA binds to both RARs and RXRs , * `` whereas all-trans-RA only binds to RARs .
*° However , it is difficult to use these retinoids in studying the involvement of RAR-RXR and RXR-RXR response pathways in mediating RA-induced effects on hematopoietic progenitor cells , because all-trans-RA as well as 9-cis-RA partly isomerize in culture to the other form of RA ( R. Blomhoff et al , unpublished results , November 1993 ) .
In addition , no natural RXR-specific ligands have been identified .
However , RA analogues have been synthesized that selectively bind to RXRs and activate the RXR-RXR pathway , but not the RAR-RXR pathway . ``
So , to dissect the involvement of the two retinoid response pathways in normal hematopoietic progenitor cell growth , we took advantage of synthetic ligands to RARs ( Ro 13-7410 ) and RXRs ( Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386 ) that selectively bind and activate RAR-RXR and RXR-RXR dimers , respectively .
The specificity of these compounds at 100 nmol/L was confirmed in transactivation experiments demonstrating that the activities of Ro 13-7410 on DR5- and DRI-regulated transcription were 5,450 and 140 , respectively , compared with medium controls set to 100 ( Table 2 ) .
In contrast , the relative activities of Ro 25-6603 on DR1- and DR5-driven transcription were 2,968 and 170 , respectively , whereas the relative activities of Ro 25-7386 on transcription regulated via DR1 and DRS response elements were 3,292 and 200 , respectively .
Based on the transactivation studies we next investigated the effects of the selective RAR and RXR ligands at 10 and 100 nmol/L on erythroid colony formation of CD34* progenitor cells .
The supplementation of all-trans-RA and the RAR-selective agonist ( Ro 13-7410 ) inhibited BFU-E colony formation by 85 % and 8§2 % , respectively ( Fig 5 ) .
Interestingly , the RXR-selective agonists Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386 also significantly inhibited SCF + Epo-induced BFU-E colony formation at both 10 and 100 nmol/L .

The selective RAR agonist Ro 13-7410 inhibited SCF + Epo-induced BFU-E colony formation in a concentration-dependent manner , with ICs , observed at 1 nmol/L , whereas a 78 % inhibition was observed at 100 nmol/L ( Fig 6A ) .
Similarly , a selective RXR agonist ( Ro 25-6603 ) inhibited SCF + Epo-induced BFU-E colony formation in a concentration-dependent manner as well with an ICs , of approximately 10 nmol/ L. Seventy-one percent inhibition was observed at an Ro 25-6603 concentration of 100 nmol/L ( Fig 6A ) .
The ICs , of Ro 25-7386 was approximately 100 nmol/L ( Fig 5 ) .
In a recent study , we showed that all-trans-RA directly inhibits G-CSF-induced colony formation of CD34* BM progenitor cells . ``
In the present study , all-trans-RA inhibited G-CSF-induced colony formation in a concentration-dependent manner , with 50 % inhibition occurring at an all-trans-RA concentration of 10 to 100 nmol/L , whereas a 62 % inhibition was observed at 100 nmol/L ( Fig 6B ) .
Similarly , the selective RAR agonist Ro 13-7410 inhibited G-CSF-induced colony growth in a concentration-dependent fash-ion , with an ICs , at 1 nmol/L , and a maximum inhibition of 63 % was observed at 100 nmol/L .
In contrast , the supplementation of the selective RXR agonists Ro 25-6603 and Ro 25-7386 , respectively , had little or no inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 100 nmol/L ( Fig 6B ) .
Although the concentration-responses for RAR ligand-induced growth inhibition of BFU-E and myeloid colony formation were simi-lar , only BFU-E colony growth was suppressed by the RXR selective ligands .

Results are presented as the mean number of colonies per 2 x 10° cells ( SEM ) of three independent experiments with duplicate determinations .
Next , experiments were performed to investigate whether the inhibitory effects of retinoids required the presence of serum .
In serum-deprived cultures , all-trans-RA and 9-cisRA ( 100 nmol/L ) inhibited SCF + Epo-induced BFU-E colony formation by 48 % and 51 % , respectively ( Table 3 ) .
Similarly , the receptor-selective retinoids Ro 13-7410 and Ro 25-6603 inhibited BFU-E colony growth by 54 % ( P < .05 ) and 36 % ( P < .05 ) , respectively .
Thus , although reti-noid-induced inhibition of BFU-E colony formation appeared less pronounced in serum-deprived than serum-con-taining medium , the results confirmed the involvement of both the RAR-RXR and RXR-RXR pathways .
DISCUSSION Previous studies on in vitro effects of retinoids on erythropoiesis have revealed contrasting results , ranging from inhi-bition `` * `` * to potent enhancement of erythroid progenitor cell growth . ``
'' The present study , using highly enriched human CD34* BM cells as well as Lin~ murine BM progenitors , shows a potent concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of RA on BFU-E colony formation in response to multiple cytokine combinations .
Erythroid colony growth was also inhibited in single-cell cloning experiments , suggesting a direct action of RA on the progenitor cells .
Others have found the plasma levels of RA isoforms in humans to be approximately 10 nmol/L . ``
However , the in vivo relevance of the higher concentrations of RA used in this study remains to be determined .
It is noteworthy that stimulatory effects of RA on erythroid progenitor cell growth have been found only in studies using unpurified erythroid progenitors , `` suggesting the possible involvement of indirect effects of RA .
In fact , only one recent study has examined the effects of RA on BFU-E colony formation in purified CD34* BM cells , but in this study it was not shown whether the observed inhibitory effect of RA was directly mediated . ``
Furthermore , it is possible that the effects of RA on erythroid progenitors might vary with their maturation stage .
In this regard , Labbaye et al `` `` demonstrated an inhibitory effect of all-trams-RA on purified peripheral blood erythroid progenitors when added at day 0 , whereas the delayed supplementation of all-trans-RA ( day 8 ) did not affect the proliferation , indicating a predominant action of RA on early erythroid progenitors .

1734 Whereas it is now established that the effects of RA ( stimulatory or inhibitory ) on GM progenitors are in part dependent on the specific growth factors it interacts with , `` `` no previous studies have examined whether RA differentially affects erythroid colony formation induced by different cyto-kines .
Here we show that BFU-E colony formation in response to Epo , Epo + SCF , Epo + IL-3 , Epo + IL-4 , and Epo + IL-9 is potently inhibited by RA .
Thus , unlike its effects on GM progenitors , the effect of RA on erythroid progenitors appears to be solely inhibitory and independent of the cooperating cytokines stimulating growth .
However , it is to be noted that RA-induced inhibition can be counteracted by the combined action of multiple erythroid stimuli , as shown by the ~100-fold difference in the ED ; , for RA when combined with SCF + Epo versus SCF + IL-3 + IL-9 + Epo .
This is consistent with the notion that multiple stimulatory growth factors can cooperate to overcome the inhibition by negative regulators .
In this regard , it has previously been shown that the combined actions of multiple cytokines can oppose the inhibitory effects of and TNF- 61.45.48 It has previously been reported that human CD34 * progenitor cells can produce TGF- $ ; , * and that RA can induce TGF-8 , protein production in a human myeloid leukemia cell line ( HL-60 ) .
* `` However , the present study suggests that a TGF-§8 autocrine loop is not required for mediating the inhibitory effects of RA on BFU-E colony formation , because the supplementation of a neutralizing antibody had little or no effect on 9-cis-RA-induced inhibition .
Furthermore , although RA-induced effects on myelopoiesis partly mimic those of TNF-a @ , the supplementation of a neutralizing anti- antiserum did not affect RA-induced inhibition of BFU-E colony growth , suggesting that TNF- « is not involved in mediating RA effects on erythroid colony formation .
We have recently demonstrated that the effects of TNF-a on committed BM progenitor cells are almost exclusively mediated by TNFR55 , ****° and the present results show that activation of TNFR55 is not required for the observed RA-induced inhibition of BFU-E colony formation .
Anemia has been ascribed to both vitamin A deficiency '* `` and hypervitaminosis A . ``
One might speculate , in agreement with the present study , that the anemia related to the latter might at least in part be a result of a direct inhibitory action of RA on the erythroid progenitor cells , although it might also indirectly result from the multiple abnormalities associated with hypervitaminosis A , including impaired liver func-tion .
Similarly , indirect mechanisms may account for the anemia associated with vitamin A deficiency .
In support of this , vitamin A deficiency in mice results in overproduction of interferon-y , `` ' a known inhibitor of erythroid progenitor growth , `` `` which can be corrected by vitamin A supplementa-tion .
Furthermore , vitamin A deficiency is associated with altered iron metabolism , which can contribute to the development of anemia . '
'' `` `` `` `` Thus , although the present study suggests that RA can directly inhibit the growth of erythroid progenitors , it seems likely that RA , presumably by indirect mechanisms , might be required for normal erythroid devel-opment .
Using synthetic retinoids selective for either of the two retinoid response pathways , Dawson et al `` `` recently showed RUSTEN ET AL that the differentiating and antiproliferative effects of retinoids on myeloid cell lines are mainly mediated through RAR-RXR heterodimers , and not RXR-RXR homodimers .
Using retinoids with a high degree of receptor selectivity , the present study suggests that the RAR-RXR response pathway can signal inhibition of SCF + Epo-stimulated erythroid colony growth , as well as inhibition of G-CSF-stimulated myeloid colony formation .
Interestingly , two different RXR-selective ligands signaled growth inhibition of SCF + Epo-stimulated erythroid but not G-CSF-stimulated myeloid colony formation .
This conclusion was supported by the finding that 100 nmoVL as well as 10 nmol/L of the RXR-selective ligands resulted in potent inhibition of BFU-E colony formation while having little or no effect on G-CSF-induced progenitor cell growth .
In contrast , the IC ; , for the inhibition induced by the RAR-selective ligand was similar for the erythroid and myeloid colony formation .
RXR-RXR homodimers have response elements different from RAR-RXR heterodimers , `` suggesting they activate distinct sets of genes .
Accordingly , the reason why RXR specific ligands might selectively inhibit erythroid but not myeloid progenitor cell growth might be that they activate pathways inhibiting erythroid but not myeloid differentia-tion .
Alternatively , the present study might suggest a differential activation of the RXR-RXR pathway in erythroid and G-CSF-responsive myeloid progenitor cells .
This could be due to the fact that RXR has been shown to form heterodimers with a variety of nuclear receptors . ``
These heterodimers can compete with RAR-RXR heterodimers and RXR-RXR homodimers and modulate the expression of genes driven by RA response elements or retinoid X response ele-ments . ``
Thus , the availability of such nuclear receptors might provide a regulatory mechanism that at least in part could explain the observed differences between the two cell types .
In conclusion , both RAR-RXR and RXR-RXR response pathways appear to be involved in mediating effects of retinoids on hematopoietic cells .
The involvement of the RXR-RXR pathway in signaling inhibitory effects on erythroid progenitors is of particular interest because , to our knowl-edge , this is the first reported biologic response elicited by selective activation of this pathway .
