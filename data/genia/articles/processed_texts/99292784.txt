From the Department of Medicine , University of Iowa College of Medicine and Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Iowa City , Iowa 52242 Although many functions of human alveolar macrophages are altered compared with their precursor cell , the blood monocyte ( monocyte ) , the reason ( s ) for these functional changes have not been determined .
We recently reported that human alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity ( Monick , M. M. , Carter , A .

To determine why alveolar macrophages do not express AP-1 DNA binding activity , we first showed that there was not a decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN proteins that make up the AP-1 complex .
There was , however , a significant difference in the amounts of the nuclear protein , REF-1 ( which regulates AP-1 DNA binding by altering the redox status of FOS and JUN pro-teins ) , in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes .
In addition , in vitro differentiation of monocytes to a macrophage-like cell resulted in decreased amounts of REF-1 .
Finally , addition of REF-1 from activated monocytes to alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins resulted in a marked increase in AP-1 DNA binding .
These studies strongly suggest that the process of differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages is associated with a loss of REF-1 and AP-1 activity .
This observation may explain , in part , some of the functional differences observed for alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes .
Alveolar macrophages are critical cells that are important for pulmonary host defense and the development of inflammation in the lung ( 1-12 ) .
Alveolar macrophages are derived from monocytes after migration of the cells into the lung and differentiation into more mature macrophages ( 13 , 14 ) .
During the process of differentiation , there are a number of phenotypic changes that result in an increased capacity to adhere to various surfaces , an increased phagocytic ability , a difference in morphology , and a changed ability to secrete cytokines ( 15 , 16 ) .
Although these differences in phenotype are well described , there is little information about changes in signal transduction pathways that might mediate the different functions of these two cell types .
The only relevant studies are those of Peters-Golden et al .
( 14 ) and a study by Monick et al .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org decreased capacity to express protein kinase C activity , compared with monocytes or other macrophages .
In the study by Monick et al .
( 11 ) , we also found that normal human alveolar macrophages had a decreased capacity to express protein kinase C-induced AP-1 DNA binding .
There are a number of FOS- and JUN-like proteins that can form the heterodimers or homodimers that make up the AP-1 complexes ( 17-20 ) .
The classic complex is comprised of c-FOS and cJUN , and these proteins are found in the nucleus of cells .
AP-1 activity can be regulated at many levels , including transcription of genes that code for AP-1 proteins , message stability , and translation of the mRNAs .
AP-1 activity is also regulated by the composition of the AP-1 complexes , phosphorylation of the proteins , and redox regulation of cysteine residues in the AP-1 proteins ( 17-21 ) .
The redox status of the AP-1 protein complex determines the binding of AP-1 to DNA .
A dual function nuclear protein called REF-1 ( or apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease DNA repair enzyme ) regulates the binding activity of AP-1 ( 22-25 ) .
This protein has two distinct and separate functions that involve different parts of the protein .
REF-1 repairs apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in DNA , and it is activated by thioredoxin to reduce cysteine residues on both FOS and JUN enabling DNA binding by AP-1 ( 22-25 ) .
This study analyzed possible mechanisms for the lack of AP-1 DNA binding in alveolar macrophages .
We found no differences in expression of c-FOS or c-JUN proteins in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes at base line or after protein kinase C stimulation .
We did find that alveolar macrophages are deficient in REF-1 .
Reconstituting alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins with monocyte-derived REF-1 reconstituted AP-1 binding activity .
In addition , when monocytes were allowed to differentiate into macrophages , in vitro , they lost REF-1 and the ability to respond to PMA * with increased AP-1 binding .
We conclude that the process of differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages is accompanied by a loss of REF-1 , affecting AP-1 binding and subsequent expression of AP-1-driven genes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of Human Alveolar Macrophages-Alveolar macrophages were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage as described previously ( 5 ) .
Briefly , normal volunteers with a lifetime non-smoking history , no acute or chronic illness , and no current medications , underwent bronchoalveolar lavage .
The lavage procedure used five 25-ml aliquots of sterile , warmed saline in each of three segments of the lung .
The lavage fluid was filtered through two layers of gauze and centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 min .
The cell pellet was washed twice in Hanks ' balanced salt solution without Ca** and Mg** and suspended in complete medium , Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) tissue culture medium ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , with 5 % fetal calf serum ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) and added gentamycin ( 80 ug/ml ) .
Differential cell counts were determined using a Wright-Giemsa-stained cytocentrifuge preparation .
All cell preparations had between 90 and 100 % alveolar macrophages .

18075 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 18076 study was approved by the Committee for Investigations Involving Human Subjects at the University of Iowa .
Isolation of Human Blood Monocytes-180 ml of heparinized blood was obtained by venipuncture of the same volunteers who underwent bronchoscopy .
Monocytes were isolated using a Ficoll-Paque gradient ( Sigma ) .
After harvesting the mononuclear cell layer , cells were washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in RPMI medium .
Additional purification was obtained by a 1-h adherence at 37 °C .
Non-adherent cells were then washed off , and RPMI medium was added back to the adherent cells .
In some instances the monocytes were allowed to differentiate into more macrophage-like cells .
In order to do this , adherent monocytes were cultured in RPMI with 10 % added human AB serum for a period of 7-10 days .
At the end of that period , floating cells were washed off , and the remaining adherent cells had spread out and obtained the pancake-like appearance of macrophages .
Isolation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift As-says-Alveolar macrophages and monocytes were cultured for 3 h with or without 100 ng/ml PMA .
The nuclear pellets were prepared by resuspending cells in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer ( 10 mm HEPES , pH 7.8 , 10 mM KCl , 2 mm MgCl , , 0.1 mM EDTA ) , placing them on ice for 15 min , and then vigorously mixing after the addition of 25 ul of 10 % Nonidet P-40 .
After a 80-s centrifugation ( 16,000 x g , 4 °C ) , the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 pl of extraction buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7.8 , 50 mm KCl , 300 mM NaCl , 0.1 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol ) and incubated on ice for 20 min .
Nuclear extracts were stored at 70°C .
The DNA binding reaction ( electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) was done at room temperature in a mixture containing 5 ug of nuclear proteins , 1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , and 15,000 cpm of *°P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe for 30 min .
The samples were fractionated through a 5 % polyacrylamide gel in 1X TBE ( Tris base 6.05 g/liter , boric acid 3.06 g/liter , EDTA-NayH,0 0.87 g/liter ) .
Sequence of the nucleotide was 5-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3 ' ( AP-1 ) .
Experiments were repeated 3 times .
Supershift assays were performed by incubating the nuclear protein with antibodies specific for c-FOS and c-JUN ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) for 80 min at room temperature before the addition of the labeled DNA probe .
Specific c-FOS and e-JUN proteins are indicated by a higher band on the gel and by an overall decrease in binding .
Isolation of RNA and Northern Analysis-Whole-cell RNA was isolated using RNA Stat-60 according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Tel-Test `` B `` , Friendswood , TX ) .
The isolated RNA was fractionated in a 1.5 % denaturing agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde .
An RNA ladder ( 0.24-9.5 kilobase pairs ; Life Technologies , Inc. ) was included as a molecular size standard .
RNA loading was confirmed by equivalent ethidium bromide staining in each lane .
The RNAs were transferred to GeneScreen Plus ( NEN Life Science Products ) as suggested by the manufacturer .
c-FOS and c-JUN cDNA probes ( generated by polymer-ase chain reaction with primers obtained from CLONTECH , Palo Alto , CA ) were labeled with [ y-*°P ] ICTP ( NEN Life Science Products ) by the random primer method .
Blots were prehybridized for 3 h at 42°C ( formamide 10 ml , NaCl 5 mM , 50 % dextran 4 ml , 10 % SDS , Tris , pH 7.0 , 1 M , and 0.4 ml 50 % Denhardt 's solution ) and then hybridized with the labeled probe overnight at 42 °C .
The filters were washed twice with 1 % SSC at 25 °C , twice with 1X SSC plus 1 % SDS at 65 °C , and then once with 0.1 % SSC at 25 °C .
The filters were exposed to autoradio-graphic film at -70 °C .
Western Analysis-For these studies , alveolar macrophages and monocytes were cultured for 3 h with or without PMA ( 10 or 100 ng/ml ) .
At the end of the culture period , either whole-cell protein extracts or nuclear protein extracts ( see gel shift protocol ) were obtained as described previously ( 11 ) .
The cell material was sonicated 15 s on ice , allowed to sit for 20 min , and then centrifuged at 15,000 % g for 10 min .
An aliquot of the supernatant was used to determine protein concentration by the Coomassie Blue method .
Equal amounts of protein ( 100 ug for whole cell extracts and 20 ug for nuclear extracts ) were mixed 1:1 with 2 % sample buffer and loaded onto a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and run at 80 V for 2 h. Cell proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose ( ECL , Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) overnight at 30 V and visualized using c-FOS , c-JUN , or REF-1-specific antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Immunoreactive bands were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate ( ECL , Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
RESULTS PMA Induces Increased AP-1 DNA Binding in Monocytes but Not Alveolar Macrophages-In order to evaluate the effect of PMA ( a model of protein kinase C-driven activation ) on AP-1 DNA binding in monocytes and alveolar macrophages from the Alveolar Macrophages and REF < -AP-1 thc Competitor _ 0 _ 0 +o o+ DNA Alvectar Blood Macrophages .

PMA induces increased AP-1 DNA binding in monocytes but not alveolar macrophages .
Monocytes and alveolar macrophages were cultured for 3 h with LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) or PMA ( 100 ng/ml ) .
Nuclear protein was isolated ; 5 ug of protein was mixed with °°P-labeled DNA , under the appropriate conditions , and the protein-bound DNA separated on a 5 % polyacrylamide gel .
A shows PMA-induced nuclear protein binding to the AP-1 site in monocytes but not alveolar macrophages .
LPS did not induce AP-1 binding in monocytes or alveolar macrophages .
B shows that the upper band in the gel shift assay is specific for AP-1 .
A gel shift similar to A was performed using monocyte-derived nuclear proteins with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled DNA oligonucleotide added to the reaction mixture .
The higher molecular weight band is completely eliminated by an excess of unlabeled probe .
same individual , cells were cultured for 3 h with and without PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) and LPS ( 1 pg/ml ) for 3 h. Nuclear proteins were isolated , and DNA binding was evaluated in a standard gel shift assay .
In Fig .
14 , we show that PMA caused an increase in protein binding to the AP-1 consensus sequence with nuclear protein from monocytes and but not with nuclear protein from alveolar macrophages .
LPS did not increase AP-1 binding in monocytes or alveolar macrophages .
In Fig .
1B , we use cold competition to show that it is the upper band ( seen only with monocyte samples ) that can be competed off with cold AP-1 oligonucleotide .
In order to confirm that the alveolar macrophages were functional , we also evaluated binding to the NF- « B sequence .
We showed that LPS increases both monocyte and alveolar macrophage nuclear protein binding to the NF- « B consensus sequence ( data not shown ) .
In Fig .
2 , we show that PMA causes an increase in AP-1 binding in monocytes over a prolonged time course ( 0.5-6 h ) .
At none of these time points was there the appearance of AP-1 binding activity in alveolar macrophages .
These data show that the difference in AP-1 binding activity between monocytes and macrophages is not simply a function of different response times .
PMA Induces c-FOS and c-JUN mRNA and Protein in Both Monocytes and Alveolar Macrophages-One possible explanation for the lack of AP-1 DNA binding in alveolar macrophages is that alveolar macrophages do not make the same amounts of AP-1 proteins as monocytes .
We initially evaluated the composition of the PMA-induced AP-1-binding proteins in monocytes with a supershift assay .
Both the upward shift of the band and the decrease in binding shown in Fig .
3 demonstrate that the monocyte AP-1 complex includes both c-FOS and ec-JUN proteins .
We next analyzed both cell types for the production of specific c-FOS and c-JUN mRNAs .
Cells were cultured for 3 h , as in the gel shift experiments , and then harvested- and whole-cell RNA was extracted ( Fig .
44 ) .
Both monocytes and alveolar macrophages responded to PMA with increased amounts of c-FOS and c-JUN message .
Compared with monocytes , the alveolar macrophages show increased amounts of both c-FOS and c-JUN mRNA .

teins in PMA-treated cells .
Both alveolar macrophages and monocytes responded to PMA with increases in amounts of c-FOS and c-JUN proteins ( Fig .
4B ) .
These experiments suggest that the decreased AP-1 binding to DNA observed in alveolar macrophages is not due to a lack of the appropriate AP-1 proteins .
Monocytes Contain More of the Nuclear Protein , REF-1 , Than Do Alveolar Macrophages-Binding of AP-1 proteins to the DNA is determined not only by presence of the transcription factor but also by its redox state that is regulated by REF-1 .
In order to determine if the observed differences in AP-1 binding between monocytes and alveolar macrophages could be explained by differences in amounts of the protein REF-1 , we obtained nuclear protein from both alveolar macrophages and monocytes from three different individuals .
Western analysis for REF-1 was performed , and the results are shown in Fig .
5 , 18077 A and B .
In all three individuals there was significantly more REF-1 in the nuclei of monocytes than in the nuclei of alveolar macrophages .
This experiment provided a possible explanation for the lack of AP-1 binding observed in PMA-treated alveolar macrophages .
In order to make sure that treatment of the cells is not changing the amounts of REF-1 , we evaluated REF-1 protein levels in both alveolar macrophages and monocytes that were treated with either LPS or PMA for 3 h. As shown in Fig .
6 , neither LPS nor PMA altered the amounts of REF-1 in the cells .
Monocytes Have a Decreased Amount of REF-1 Following Differentiation into Macrophages-We next performed an experiment that links differentiation of monocytes to the defect in AP-1 DNA binding seen in alveolar macrophages .
As an in vitro correlate of the in vivo differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages , we evaluated the amount of REF-1 in the nucleus of differentiated monocytes and the ability of PMA to induce AP-1 binding in differentiated monocytes .
In order to do this , we obtained blood monocytes and harvested nuclear protein from half the cells immediately after isolation .
The remaining cells were put into culture with 10 % human AB serum for 7 days .
At the end of this time period , the cells morpholog-ically resembled macrophages and nuclear protein was isolated .
Fig .
7 shows that the process of differentiation into macrophage-like cells is associated with decreased amounts of REF-1 .
Fig .
8 is an AP-1 gel shift with PMA-treated nuclear proteins from monocytes compared with differentiated monocytes .
The differentiated monocytes have lost their ability to increase AP-1 binding with PMA .
There is more AP-1 binding in the control differentiated monocytes than in the control undifferentiated monocytes .
This could just be a function of the difference between in vitro differentiation and in vivo differen-tiation .
As a composite these two experiments show that with differentiation monocytes have reduced amounts of REF-1 and do not respond to PMA with increased AP-1 DNA binding .
REF-1 from Monocytes Can Increase AP-1 Binding in Nuclear Extracts from Alveolar Macrophages-The second experiment to link a defect in AP-1 binding to REF-1 was performed in alveolar macrophages .
Both monocytes and alveolar macrophages were cultured with and without PMA , and nuclear protein was isolated .
We next immunoprecipitated REF-1 from 20 ug of monocyte nuclear extract and added it to the macrophage nuclear proteins 15 min before addition of the labeled probe and allowed to sit at room temperature .
Fig .
9 shows that PMA-treated macrophages alone do not exhibit significant amounts of AP-1 DNA binding ( 2nd lane ) and that the addition of monocyte REF-1 results in AP-1 binding ( 3rd lane ) .
The amount of AP-1 binding in the control alveolar macrophage is a function of the variation found between individuals .
Some people showed no AP-1 binding , and others showed a small amount of base-line binding .
None of the individuals studied showed any increase in binding with the addition of PMA .
We also performed a number of controls as follows : the 4h lane contains macrophage nuclear extract with monocyte protein precipitated with an isotype control antibody ( rabbit IgG ) , the 5th lane contains macrophage nuclear protein with monocyte protein precipitated with an irrelevant antibody ( a « p65 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and the 6th lane contains immunoprecipitated monocyte REF-1 with no macrophage nuclear protein .
Also shown on this blot is an AP-1 gel shift of the monocyte nuclear protein used for the immunoprecipitations .
This figure shows that AP-1 proteins from PMA-treated alveolar macrophages can bind to DNA after monocyte REF-1 has been added .

phages , compared with monocytes , is due to a relative lack of the redox protein , REF-1 , and is not due to a lack of AP-1 proteins .
We were able to reconstitute normal AP-1 DNA binding in alveolar macrophage nuclear extracts by adding REF-1 from monocytes .
This was specific for AP-1 , since the DNA binding activity of NF- « B was similar in alveolar macrophages and monocytes .
This loss of REF-1 in alveolar macrophages may be due to the process of macrophage differentiation since monocytes lost REF-1 as they differentiated in vitro , into macrophage-like cells .
To our knowledge , this study is the first description of normal cells with a defect in AP-1 binding caused by a lack of REF-1 .
AP-1 is an important regulator of expres- sion of many genes .
The relative lack of REF-1 and AP-1 DNA binding activity may explain , in part , the functional differences between alveolar macrophages and their precursors , monocytes .
REF-1 is a ubiquitous nuclear protein found in mammalian nuclear extracts .
It was initially studied for its DNA repair function , which is found at the C-terminal portion of the mol-ecule .
The redox regulator , located close to the N terminus , is structurally and functionally distinct from the DNA portion of the molecule ( 35 , 36 ) .
REF-1 , itself , is controlled by redox modification of cysteines by the protein , thioredoxin ( 25 ) .

The addition of monocyte-derived REF-1 to alveolar macrophage nuclear protein results in increased AP-1 DNA binding .
Blood monocytes were cultured with PMA for 3 h ; nuclear protein was isolated , and REF-1 or control proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibody-coated Sepharose .
An AP-1 gel shift was then performed with alveolar macrophage nuclear protein alone ( Control and PMA ) and with alveolar macrophage nuclear protein ( PMA ) with immunoprecipitated proteins from monocytes .
This figure shows no AP-1 binding by alveolar macrophages , AP-1 binding by PMA-treated alveolar macrophages after the addition of monocyte REF-1 and a series of controls : Control A , immunoprecipitation with an isotype control instead of Control B , immunoprecipitation with an irrelevant antibody ( p65 ) instead of « REF-1 ; and Control C , immunoprecipitated REF-1 without alveolar macrophage nuclear protein .

creased REF-1 mRNA and protein in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells , and Suzuki et al .
( 28 ) showed that human chorionic gonado-tropin increased REF-1 in murine Leydig cells .
In an animal model , Gillardon et al .
( 29 ) showed that global ischemia induced by cardiac arrest increased expression of REF-1 in the rat hippocampus .
All of these studies are cases in which an intervention results in an increase in REF-1 expression .
In contrast to these studies , Robertson et al .
( 30 ) showed that induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells results in down-regulation of REF-1 .
Walton et al .
( 31 ) evaluated rat brains following ischemia and found that apoptotic cells had a significant decrease in amounts of REF-1 .
One possible explanation for our data is that the alveolar macrophages are undergoing apoptosis .
This is not likely since all studies of normal human alveolar macrophages reported to date showed that the cells must be exposed to a toxic stimulus to trigger apoptosis .
We showed in a number of studies that alveolar macrophages are not acti-vated , unless they are exposed to endotoxin or another stimulus in vitro ( 5 , 9-11 , 32 , 33 ) .
Our studies evaluated REF-1 immediately after the cells were obtained from normal volun-teers .
These observations are supported by observations of Bingisser ef al .
( 34 ) who showed that unstimulated normal human alveolar macrophages do not undergo apoptosis but that apoptosis could be induced in human alveolar macrophages by high levels of endotoxin .
These studies are the first to show that a normal cell can be deficient in REF-1 and that this can result in a defect in AP-1 DNA binding .
These studies also suggest that it is the process of differentiation that results in the decreased levels of REF-1 in alveolar macrophages .
The findings that we describe in this study may explain some of the functional differences between .
alveolar macrophages and their precursors blood monocytes .
