To distinguish these instructive and selective models , we used surface affinity matrix technology to isolate committed progenitors based on cytokine secretion phenotype and developed retroviral-based tagging approaches to directly monitor individual progenitor fate decisions at the clonal and population levels .
We observe IL-4-dependent redirection of phenotype in cells that have already committed to a non-IL-4-producing fate , inconsistent with predictions of the selective model .
Further , retroviral tagging of naive progenitors with the Th2-specific transcription factor GATA-3 provided direct evidence for instructive differentiation , and no evidence for the selective outgrowth of cells committed to either the Th1 or Th2 fate .
These data would seem to exclude selection as an exclusive mechanism in Th1/Th2 differentiation , and sup port an instructive model of cytokine-driven transcriptional programming of cell fate decisions .
Key words : Introduction Antigen-activated CD4* T cells differentiate into either Th1 or Th2 cells , producing proinflammatory or proaller-gic cytokines , respectively .
The best understood mode of regulating Th cell differentiation is the cytokine environment during primary T cell activation , with IL-12 associated with Th1 development and IL-4 with Th2 development .
However , it is still uncertain how these cytokines mediate their effect on differentiation ( 1 ) .
Coffman and Reiner ( 1 ) recently articulated three competing models , each compatible with the observed effects of cytokines on differentiation .
In the instructive model , cytokine signaling precedes progenitor commitment ; that is , cytokines direct each progenitor towards a defined fate through a program of molecular cues .
In the selective model , progenitor commitment is independent of cytokines ; that is , progenitor Address correspondence to K.M .

In a hybrid instructive-selective model , the ratio of progenitors initially committing to each fate may be altered by cytokines , but cytokine-driven selective outgrowth of committed cells is retained as a required mechanism of polarization .
An instructive model seemed compatible with known molecular processes in T cells , such as cytokine regulation of transcription factor expression and cytokine-dependent chromatin alterations in the IL-4 locus ( 2 , 3 ) .
Further , the specific requirement of the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) 4 ( 4 , 5 ) and Stat6 ( 6 , 7 ) in Th1 and Th2 development , respectively , was generally interpreted to indicate an instructive role for cytokines in Th differentiation .
However , the analysis of Stat4- and Stat6é-deficient T cells was done on bulk populations and not performed specifically to distinguish instructive or selective models of development .

The difficulty in distinguishing between these models by previous studies arises from their inability to directly track fates and measure relative outgrowth of individual progeni-tors .
Initial bulk population analysis suggested that Th2 development was absolutely IL-4 dependent , consistent with either model ( 6 , 7 ) .
However , recent results have modified this thinking ( 15-17 ) .
Th2 development has recently been reported to occur in Stat6-deficient animals ( 15 , 16 ) and to be dependent on GATA-3 expression independently of IL-4 and Stat6 ( 17 ) .
GATA-3 expression , although augmented by IL-4 through Stat6 , can also be achieved independently of IL-4 , involving a Stat6-independent pathway of autoacti-vation .
This feature of GATA-3 expression allows progenitors to acquire a stable , cytokine-independent phenotype in which GATA-3 directs the elaboration of downstream hallmarks of Th2 development that occur in response to IL-4 .
Importantly , ectopic GATA-3 expression in Staté-deficient T cells induces all developmental components of the Th2 phenotype such as c-Maf expression , chromatin remodeling of the IL-4 locus , and Th2 cytokine gene expression ( 17 ) .
Further , Th2 commitment need not be absolutely IL-4 dependent , as other factors , such as TCR/CD28 signaling ( 18 ) and IL-12 ( 17 , 19 ) can regulate GATA-3 expression .
Thus , any signal that can regulate GATA-3 expression would also be expected to regulate Th2 development .
In this study , we have used two recently described tech-nologies , cellular affinity matrix sorting and retroviral tag-ging , to determine whether GATA-3 functions to promote outgrowth of cells that have stochastically committed to IL-4 production ( selection ) , or whether GATA-3 mediates pro-grammatic alterations in gene expression without affecting outgrowth of uncommitted progenitors ( instruction ) .
To accommodate the known effects of GATA-3 expression in Statb-deficient T cells , the selective model must adopt GATA-3 , rather than Stat6 , as a mediator of selective outgrowth of Th2 cells .
However , in a direct test of this hy-pothesis , we found no evidence that GATA-3 influences selective outgrowth when expressed in Stat6é-deficient T cells developing under any conditions .
Rather , GATA-3 expression increased the proportion of IL-4-committed progenitors , even when developing in the presence of IL-12 , a condition predicted by the selective model to inhibit the outgrowth of cells committed to the Th2 phenotype .
These data exclude purely selective models of Th2 development and provide strong evidence that GATA-3 instructs Th2 development without inducing selective outgrowth .
Materials and Methods Sorting of Live IL-4-secreting Cells by Cellular Affinity Matrix Technology .
- In vitro cultures of DO11.10 TCR transgenic wild-type and DO11.10* X Staté~'~ CD4* T cells were stimulated with OVA protein under neutralizing conditions in the presence of a-IL-4 ( 11B11 , 10 pg/ml ) , a-IL-12 ( Tosh , 10 ug/ml ) , and o-IFN-y ( H22 , 10 pg/ml ) .
7 d after primary activation , live CD4*/IL-4-secreting cells were purified as described previously ( 17 ) with the following modifications .
Cell cultures were restimulated with PMA/ionomycin for 2.5 h and subsequently labeled with the bifunctional Ab conjugate specific for CD45 ( 30-F11 ) and IL-4 ( BVD6-24G2 ) for surface-capture of secreted IL-4 .
The cells were then diluted in medium and allowed to secrete IL-4 for 30 min at 37°C as described ( 17 ) .
IL-4-secreting CD4* T cells were identified by staining with a secondary mAb o-IL-4-PE ( 11B11-PE ; BD PharMingen ) and a-mCD4-TriColor ( GK1.5-TC ; Caltag ) .
IL-4* and IL-4~7 cells were purified by FACS® sorting as described ( 20 , 21 ) .
Retroviral Transduction .
- DO11.10* X Stat6~'~ CD4* T cells were activated for 36 h with OVA under Th1 ( rmIL-12 [ 10 U/ml ] , and a-IL-4 ) or Th2 ( @ -IL-12 , and a-IFN-y and/or rmIL-4 [ 100 U/ml ] ) conditions .
T cell cultures were then transduced with retroviral culture supernatants derived from the transient transfection of the Phoenix-ecotropic retrovirus packaging cell line ( 19 ) .
Percentages of retroviral-transduced cells were monitored for the expression of retroviral marker proteins green fluorescence protein ( GFP ) and hCD4 by FACS® analysis .
T Cell Cloning .
DO11.10* X Staté~'~ CD4* T cells were activated with OVA protein under either Th1 or Th2 conditions and transduced with retroviral vectors as described in the text .
Cells were rested in bulk culture to day 7 of activation and CD4*GFP+* cells were purified by FACS® sorting .
Purified T cells were cloned by single-cell deposition cloning by FACS® sorting into 96-well plates containing 5 X 10° irradiated BALB/c splenocytes , OVA protein ( 0.5 mg/ml ) , and rhIL-2 ( 50 U/ml ! )
in 200 pl medium ( DMEM supplemented with L-glutamine [ 0.2 mM ] , nonessential amino acids [ 10 M each ] , sodium pyruvate [ 100 wMJ , B-mercaptoethanol [ 50 uM ] , and penicillin/strepto-mycin [ 100 U/ml each ] ) .
Cellular outgrowth was monitored between days 10-15 of plating , and individual clones were expanded by restimulation with irradiated BALB/c splenocytes , OVA protein , and rhIL-2 ( 50 U/ml ) .
Identification of GFP-expressing Retrovirus and GATA-3-GFP-transduced T Cell Clones by PCR .
Genomic DNA derived from independent T cell clones were amplified for the detection of both the control GFP-expressing retrovirus ( GFPRV ) and the GATA3-GFP integrated retroviral vectors by a two-step nested PCR tech-nique .
These PCR reactions were performed with the following primers : GFPRV , first set : 5-CCTACATCGTGACCTGG-GAAGCCTTGG , 5-GTTCCGCTGCCTGCAAAGGCGTCGC , nest : 5-GGTCAAGCCCTTTGTACACCCTAAGCCTCC , 5'-CCTAGGAATGCTCGTCAAGAAGACAGGGC ; GATA-3-GFP , first set : 5-GGTGAAGAGATGAGGACTGGAGTGGCC , nest : TTGTACACCCTAAGCCTCCGCC , 5-GGAGGGTAAACG-GACAGAGGCCCC .
As controls , genomic DNA from nontransduced and single-transduced T cells from bulk culture populations were amplified in parallel PCR reactions .
Clones used in the study were infected by one type of retrovirus , positive for either GFPRV or GATA-3-GFP , but not both .
Results and Discussion The observation that both IL-4- and IFN-y-producing T cells can emerge under nonpolarizing conditions has been interpreted to suggest that a random , or stochastic 644 GATA-3 Instructs Th2 Development process generates the initial phenotype repertoire , motivating the selective model ( 1 , 9 , 11 ) .
Indeed , when naive progenitors are activated under conditions in which IL-12 , IL-4 , and IFN-y are all neutralized , a persistent population of cells was still observed that committed to the production of either IL-4 or IFN-y ( Fig .
1 C ) .
By the selective model , the increase in populations developing in fully polarizing conditions ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) arise from the selective outgrowth of cells that stochastically commit even in the absence of these conditions ( i.e .
, from the populations in Fig .
1 C ) .
Moreover , this interpretation is consistent with persistence of a small IL-4-producing population even in Stat6-deficient mice ( Fig .
1 , E and F ) , which are proposed to represent committed progenitors whose phenotypes are fixed and awaiting selective outgrowth via the effects of polarizing cytokines .
However , the instructive and selective models differ in their predictions of how committed cells should respond to subsequent IL-4 exposure .
In the selective model , commitment is permanent , with subsequent cytokine exposure altering cell growth , but not differentiation .
In the instructive model , commitment results from cytokine-derived signals , which could be delivered even after initial activation .
These predictions can be distinguished by testing responses of committed progenitors to the polarizing effects of IL-4 .
To test this experimentally , cells initially committed to an IL-4-producing phenotype or IL-4-nonproducing phenotype would need to be separated and analyzed independently for differentiation when exposed to IL-4 ( Fig .
2 a ) .
To separate IL-4-producing from IL-4-nonproducing committed cells , we used the novel cellular affinity matrix technology for purifying live cells based on their IL-4 Th1 Tha Tho 10° ( G A & A & 6.7 C Wild Type 46 3.6 10° ore !

IL-4- and Stat6-independent commitment to IL-4-producing phenotype .
DO11.10 TCR transgenic wild-type ( A-C ) or DO11.10 Stat6-deficient ( Stat6 `` ~ , D-F ) T cells were stimulated with OVA ( 0.5 mg/ml chicken OVA ) with the addition of IL-12 ( 10 U/ml ) and 11B11 ( 10 ug/ml ; Th1 ; A and D ) , the addition of IL-4 ( 100 U/ml ) , anti-IFN-y ( H22 , 10 pg/ml ! )
and anti-IL-12 ( Tosh , 10 pg/ml ; Th2 ; B and E ) , or with addition of anti-IL-12 , anti-IFN-y , and anti-IL-4 ( ThQ ; C and F ) , as described ( reference 17 ) .
7 d after activation , cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h followed by analysis of IL-4 and IFN-y production by intracellular staining as described previously ( references 20 , 21 , and 26 ) .
Gates for analysis excluded dead cells and quadrants were set based on isotype control stainings ( reference 26 ) .
The percentages displayed indicate the frequency of cells positive for IL-4 or IFN-y within the live cell gates .
secretion ( 17 ) .
Wild-type and Stat6é-deficient ( Stat6~'~ ) DO11.10 naive T cells were activated in the presence of anti-IL-4 , anti-IL-12 , and anti-IFN-y .
On day 7 , cells were reactivated with PMA and ionomycin ( Fig .
2 b , A ) , and CD4* T cells were sorted into IL-4-nonsecreting cells ( Fig .
2 b , B ) and IL-4-secreting cells ( Fig .
2 b , C ) .
Each population was then divided and restimulated either in the presence of IL-4 or anti-IL-4 mAb ( 11B11 ) for 7 d. Upon restimulation , IL-4 and IFN-y production by individual cells was measured by intracellular staining ( Fig .
2 b , D-S ) .
Cells that had initially committed to IL-4 production ( Fig .
2 b , C ) retained this property at a frequency compatible with differentiated Th2 cells ( Fig .
2 b , F and G ) .
The frequency of IL-4-positive cells in both wild-type and Stat6-deficient populations was only slightly increased by exposure to IL-4 in secondary culture ( Fig .
2 b , compare G to F and O to NJ .
Cells that initially had not produced IL-4 and were not exposed to IL-4 in secondary culture remained negative for IL-4 production later ( Fig .
2 b , D and L ) , as predicted by both models .
However , wild-type cells that were initially IL-4 negative ( Fig .
2 b , B ) , and were exposed to IL-4 in secondary culture showed a significantly increased frequency of IL-4-producing cells ( compare Fig .
2 b , E to D ) , consistent with redirection to an IL-4-producing fate .
This increase in IL-4 frequency was not observed in Stat6-deficient cells ( Fig .
2 b , compare M to L ) , suggesting that the effect required an intact IL-4 signaling pathway .
Thus , this effect can not be explained as a continued stochastic generation of IL-4-producing cells , as the selective model would predict this to also occur in Stat6-deficient cells as well as in wild-type cells exposed to anti-IL-4 mAb .
In addition , we observed only a minor population of cells committed to producing IFN-y in wild-type cells sorted for being IL-4 negative ( Fig .
2 b , H and I ) .
The percentage of this population in wild-type and Stat6b-defi-cient cells was not influenced by either the presence or absence of IL-4 ( Fig .
2 b , H to K and P to S ) .
Thus , in these experiments , the expansion of IFN-y-producing Th1 cells was not seen , eliminating its potential influence on inhibiting Th2 development in Stat6é-deficient T cells .
In sum-mary , IL-4 exposure appears to direct Th2 commitment even after the initial period predicted by the selective model to generate the stochastic fixed repertoire .
Due to the kinetics of gene activation , the frequency of IL-4 staining in activated Th2 cells is not 100 % , but ~30-50 % , consistent with previous reports ( 20-23 ) .
Thus , it is still possible to interpret the above results as consistent with the selective model by explaining the apparent redirection of cells in Fig .
2 as the IL-4-dependent outgrowth of Th2-committed cells that simply happened to not produce IL-4 at the time of sorting .
Thus , to rigorously distinguish these aspects of selection from instruction , it is therefore necessary to track progenitor fates and frequencies as they expand in culture .
To do this , we developed a retroviral-based tagging system in which either a GFP retrovirus or a GATA-3-expressing retrovirus is used to mark cells by infection during the initial activation ( Fig .
3 a ) .

These experiments were performed three times with consistent results .
tive models differ in how they predict progenitors will respond to tagging by the GATA-3-expressing retroviruses .
To account for the known effects of GATA-3 , the selective model predicts that cells committing to either IL-4-positive or IL-4-negative fates should each expand in response to GATA-3 , but should not alter their respective fates ( Fig .
3 a ) .
In contrast , the instructive model predicts that , independent of initial commitment , progenitors tagged by GATA-3 may undergo redirection of fate toward IL-4 production .
The control retrovirus expressing only the GFP tag is not predicted to alter fates in either model .
In es-sence , the selective model predicts outgrowth of both GATA-3-expressing Th1 and Th2 clones , whereas the instructive model predicts that GATA-3 infected clones will be strongly skewed to a Th2 fate , with marked reduction in the numbers of GATA-3-infected Th1 clones .
To eliminate any bias , we blinded this tagging experiment to the identity of the retrovirus by infecting progeni- 646 tors with a mixture of control and GATA-3 retroviruses , both expressing GFP as the retroviral marker .
The identity of the retrovirus infecting each clone was revealed by PCR only at the end of the experiment .
Stat6-deficient progenitors were infected with GFP and GATA-3 retroviruses and activated in either Th1 or Th2 conditions .
On day 7 , single retrovirally infected CD4* cells were directly cloned into nonselecting conditions ( i.e .
, in the absence of IL-12 , IL-4 , or IFN-y ) .
Clones were expanded and characterized for IL-4 and IFN-y expression by ELISA to assign phenotype ( Fig .
3 b ) , and only then was the identity of the infecting retrovirus determined .
Cytokine production by all clones is presented in Fig .
3 b for progenitors activated in Th1 ( Fig .

The majority of clones exhibit cytokine production that is near to one of the cytokine axes , consistent with polarization observed in bulk populations .

- Clonal analysis of commitment in Staté-deficient T cells in fected with control or GAT A-3-expressing retroviruses .
( a ) Comparisons of predictions of selective and instructive models .
Progenitors committed to either an IL-4-producing ( shaded circles ) or a non-IL-4-producing phenotype ( open circles ) are infected with control retrovirus or GATA-3-expressing retrovirus .
The selective model predicts GATA-3 to promote outgrowth of cells and not to affect their differentiation , whereas the instructive model predicts that GATA-3 should promote the differentiation of all progenitors to the IL-4-producing fate .
( b ) Staté-deficient DO11.10 cells were activated with OVA under Th1 or Th2 conditions ( reference 17 ) .
36 h after activation , cells were infected with a mixture of two retroviruses , GFPRV and a GATA-3-expressing retrovirus ( GATA3-GEP ; reference 27 ) .
7 d after activation , GFP-expressing CD4+* T cells were purified and cloned by flow cytometric sorting and single-cell deposition into 96-well plates containing irradiated BALB/c splenocytes and OVA .
After expansion , independent clones were restimulated on anti-CD3-coated plates for 24 h and supernatants analyzed for IL-4 and IFN-y secretion by ELISA ( reference 28 ) .
The retrovirus infecting the clone was then determined by genomic PCR analysis .
Cytokine production by individual clones derived from Th1 or Th2 conditions is presented in A and B. Cytokine production of clones segregated by the identity of the infecting retrovirus is presented in C-F. tokine production being above or below the diagonal , after which the retrovirus identity was determined ( Fig .
3 b , C-F ) .
Stat6-deficient cells that were infected with control GFP retrovirus were strongly skewed to the Th1 pheno- type , regardless of initial activation conditions ( Fig .
3 b , C and E ) .
The low number of IL-4-producing clones is compatible with the observed frequency of IL-4-positive cells in bulk populations ( Fig .
1 E ) .
However , Stat6-deficient clones infected with the GATA-3 retrovirus were markedly skewed to the Th2 fate , even in those clones whose progenitors were activated under Th1-inducing conditions ( Fig .
3 b , D and F ) .
Further , there was no apparent difference in the numbers of clones obtained under various conditions , arguing against any gross differences in selective outgrowth .
Thus , the results of this retroviral tagging experiment are inconsistent with predictions of the selective model described above .
To try to accommodate for this last experiment , the selective model could be slightly revised to propose that the growth-promoting effects of GATA-3 can only be exerted in cells that are also committed to IL-4 production , and not in other cells .
In this revised selective model , the decreased number of GATA-3-infected Th1 clones would be due to the inability of GATA-3 to promote outgrowth of non-IL-4-producing cells , rather than from the conversion of their phenotype from Th1 to Th2 fate .
Although it may be conceivable to construct a selective mechanism to restrict the effects of GATA-3 in this way , importantly this possibility can be tested using a dual-marker retroviral system to simultaneously track both fate and expansion of committed cells over time .
We carried out this approach using unique markers to distinguish two retroviruses , with the control retrovirus expressing hCD4 , and GATA-3 retrovirus expressing GFP .
In these experiments ( Fig .
4 ) , Stat6-deficient progenitors were infected with a mixture of control retrovirus and GATA-3 retrovirus in the same cultures , and activated under either Th1 or Th2 conditions .
Cells were expanded together in bulk culture , and IL-4 production by individual cells was analyzed on day 7 and on day 14 after secondary stimulation , allowing direct measurement of the frequency and phenotype of cells over time .
On day 7 and day 14 , cells were activated with PMA/ ionomycin for 4 h and stained for intracellular production of IL-4 .
Cells were gated for expression of a single retroviral marker ( Fig .
4 , A and B ) , and the percentage of IL-4-positive cells in each gate was measured by intracellular IL-4 staining ( Fig .
4 C ) .
Last , the proportion of each retrovirally infected population is expressed as a percentage of the whole population ( Fig .
4 D ) .
Infection by the control virus had no effect on IL-4 production by cells over time , either in the Th1- or Th2-activated conditions ( Fig .
4 C ) , as ex-pected .
In contrast , infection by the GATA-3 retrovirus ( GFP-positive cells ) markedly increased the percentage of IL-4-positive cells between day 7 and day 14 .
This effect occurred in both Th1 and Th2 conditions , and these data were highly reproducible in replicate experiments ( Table I ) .
Importantly , the percentage of IL-4-producing cells within the GATA-3 population increased even though the total percentage of GATA-3-infected cells remains constant over time , consistent with a continuing developmental effect .
Finally , the prediction of the revised selective model is not observed ; that is , we observe a constant ratio 647 Farrar et al .

Staté-deficient DO11.10 splenocytes were activated with OVA under Th1 or Th2 conditions ( reference 17 ) .
36 h after activation , cells were infected with a mixture of two retroviral vectors containing control retrovirus expressing human CD4 extracellular domain marker protein ( CD4RV ) and the GATA-3-expressing retrovirus expressing a GFP marker protein ( GATA3-GFP ; reference 17 ) .
7 d after primary activation , each culture was analyzed for GFP , hCD4 , and intracellular IL-4 by FACS® analysis ( A and B ) .
The remaining cells were restimulated with irradiated BALB/c splenocytes and OVA for an additional 7 d. After secondary stimulation , the cells were analyzed for expression of GFP , hCD4 , and intracellular IL-4 .
Shown are FACS® analyses of T cell cultures developed under Th1 ( A ) or Th2 ( B ) conditions and analyzed for the expression of the retroviral markers GFP ( bottom right polygon ) and human CD4 ( top left polygon ) .
( C ) T cells expressing intracellular IL-4 are calculated as a percentage of cells expressing the gated retroviral marker proteins from cultures analyzed 7 d ( white bars ) and 14 d ( stippled bars ) after primary activation .
( D ) T cells expressing the retroviral marker proteins ( polygon gates , top pan-els ) are expressed as a percentage of the total number of live cells .
Data from replicate analyses are presented in Table I. of cells infected with control or GATA-3 retrovirus over time in both conditions , rather than an increase in the proportion of GAT A-3-expressing cells as predicted by the selective model .
These results strongly argue against a purely selective mechanism in GATA-3-dependent Th2 development .
First , we observed an apparent redirection of fate caused by exposure of previously non-IL-4-producing cells to an IL-4A-producing phenotype , inconsistent with the selective model .
Second , we observed that GATA-3 strongly skewed the frequency of individual clones that commit to IL-4 production but did not exert selective outgrowth of clones already committed to the Th1 fate , as would be predicted by the selective model .

of distinctly committed cells , which revealed an increasing frequency of IL-4 production in the absence of any apparent increase in size of this committed population .
Taken together , these results strongly support an instructive interpretation of recent findings regarding the transcriptional regulation of GATA-3-induced Th2 development .
The initial production of IL-4 by small numbers of Stat6-deficient T cells is consistent with either the stochastic expression of GATA-3 in a small percentage of T cells or with the regulated expression of GATA-3 by additional factors , including the TCR/CD28 signaling pathway , as described recently ( 18 ) .
Importantly , either explanation is consistent with an instructive model for GATA-3-induced Th2 development .
However , it is possible that IL-4 could exert some selective/growth-promoting effects on committed Th2 cells that may not completely involve Stat6-dependent GATA-3 regulation ( 24 ) .
For example , we observed a 10 % increase in the proportion of IL-4-producing cells in both wild-type and Stat6-deficient Th2 cells after secondary exposure to IL-4 ( Fig .
2 b , F to G and N to O ) .
However , this observation may be consistent with either instructive or selective models ; instructive , if IL-4 could augment expression of GATA-3 or other transcription factors through Stat6-independent pathways , which we have not excluded ; selective , if IL-4 could alter cell survival or proliferation through a Stat6-independent pathway such as insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) -1 ( 25 ) .
Regardless , our results exclude models exclusively requiring selection to explain GATA-3-induced Th2 development , and strongly support the existence of an instructive component in this process .
