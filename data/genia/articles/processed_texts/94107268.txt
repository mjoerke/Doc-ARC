( 1994 ) 297 , 163-173 ( Printed in Great Britain ) 163 Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and T-cell activation by vanadate peroxide , an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases Véronique IMBERT , Jean-Francois PEYRON , * Dariush FARAHI FAR , Bernard MARI , Patrick AUBERGER and Bernard ROSSI INSERM U364 , Faculté de Médecine , Avenue de Valombrose , 06107 Nice cedex 02 , France Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of key cellular proteins is a crucial event in the transduction of activation signals to T-lymphocytes .
The regulatory role of protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPases ) in this process was explored by studying the effects of a powerful PTPase inhibitor , vanadate peroxide ( pervanadate ) , on the activation cascade of Jurkat human leukaemic T-cells .
Pervanadate induced activation of the tyrosine kinases Ick and fyn ( 4- and 3-fold respectively ) and a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins , notably phospholipase C yl .
After this event , we observed a rise in intracellular Ca** concentration , corresponding to an influx .
This effect required surface expression of the CD45 PTPase and was not observed in CD45-deficient variants of Jurkat cells .
In the CD4S5-negative variant , the effect of pervanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation was globally decreased and some phosphoryl- ated substrates were specifically missing .
Pervanadate also stimulated transcription of the c-fos gene and accumulation of its mRNA as well as several other hallmarks of T-lymphocyte activation such as surface expression of the CD69 antigen and the interleukin 2 receptor a-chain ( CD25 ) .
Pervanadate synergized with signals delivered by T-cell antigen receptor engagement or by a phorbol ester to induce interleukin 2 production .
Pervanadate activated NF- « B , as shown by an increase in DNA-binding activity of this transcription factor .
We thus conclude that PTPases play a crucial role in the negative regulation of signal transduction culminating in T-lymphocyte activation .
Moreover , induction of tyrosine phosphorylation appears sufficient per se to initiate a complete activation pro-gramme .
INTRODUCTION Antigen recognition by T-lymphocytes through the T-cell antigen receptor , TcR-CD3 , is a central event in the initiation of an immune response .
This multimeric complex consists of an antigen-binding clonotypic « / $ heterodimer ( TcR ) non-covalently associated with the invariant chains of the CD3 complex y , 8 and e and the disulphide-linked homodimer & -£ [ 1,2 ] .
Stimulation of the TcR-CD3 complex by antigen or agonistic monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) raised against TcR or CD3 activates a signal-transduction cascade .
The earliest event in this cascade is a stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins [ 3,4 ] .
Tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) inhibitors have been shown to block early as well as late events resulting from TcR-CD3 triggering [ 5,6 ] , suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is absolutely required for all downstream events in the T-cell response to antigen .
Moreover , stimulation of the T-cell receptor leads to an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cy1 ( PLCy1 ) which is likely to induce an augmentation of its catalytic activity [ 7,8 ] and the subsequent generation of the second messengers inositol trisphosphate ( IP , ) and diacylglycerol [ 9 ] .
As the TcR-CD3 does not possess intrinsic kinase activity , it is probably associated with independent PTK ( s ) .
Candidates for this role are fyn and Ick , two members of the src tyrosine kinase family [ 10,11 ] .
Recently , fyn has been found to coprecipitate with the CD3 complex [ 12 ] and to be activated by TcR-CD3 triggering [ 13 ] .
Lok is associated with the cytoplasmic tail of the CD4 surface molecule which forms a co-receptor with TcR-CD3 [ 14,15 ] .
Although Ick plays a major role in CD4 signalling [ 16 ] , it seems to be also required for normal TcR-CD3 signal transduction [ 17 ] .
To avoid prolonged stimulation of the cell which could lead to malignant proliferation , tyrosine phosphorylation must be tightly controlled during cell homoeostasis .
Protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPases ) specifically dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues thereby negatively regulating tyrosine kinase signalling [ 18 ] .
In T-lymphocytes , the major PTPase expressed on the plasma membrane is the CD45 antigen [ 19 ] .
Studies of CD45-deficient variants of various human T-cell lines showed that CD45 is required to couple the T-cell receptor to downstream signalling events [ 20-22 ] .
Moreover , anti-CD45 mAbs have been shown to regulate T- and B-cell activation [ 23,24 ] .
T-cells also express at least another PTPase , Tc PTPase , a cytosolic enzyme of as yet unknown function [ 25 ] .
To study the role of PTPases during T-cell activation , we have used a powerful PTPase inhibitor , vanadate peroxide ( pervanadate ) , to alter the equilibrium between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions .
Mixing orthovanadate with H , O , forms vanadyl hydroperoxide ( V*+*OOH ) also termed vanadate peroxide or pervanadate [ 26 ] .
This compound has been proven to be a powerful activator of platelets [ 27 ] and myeloid cells [ 28,29 ] and to be an insulinomimetic agent [ 30 ] .
Its effects have been shown to be associated with an important increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and with activation of the insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase [ 31,32 ] .
We show that inhibition of PTPases by pervanadate in cells of the human leukaemic line Jurkat results in generation of early [ tyrosine phosphorylation , Ick and fyn activation , Ca*®* fluxes , c-fos induction , nuclear factor « B ( NF- Abbreviations used : PTK , protein tyrosine kinase ; PTPase , protein tyrosine phosphatase ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; IL-2 , interleukin 2 ; mAb , monocional antibody ; TeR-CD3 , T-cell antigen receptor complex ; pNPP , p-nitrophenyl phosphate ; PLCy1 , phospholipase Cy1 ; IP3 , inositol trisphosphate ; PMSF , phenylimethanesulphonyl fluoride ; DTT , dithiothreitol ; Facs , fluorescence-activated cell sorter ; FITC , fluorescein isothiocyanate ; PKC , protein kinase C. * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

These results suggest that , although PTPases are necessary to deliver a positive signal for some PTK activity [ 33-35 ] , they also play a crucial role in the negative regulation of T-cell activation .

RESULTS Pervanadate inhibits cellular PTPase activity We have examined the effects of pervanadate on Jurkat PTPase activities towards a phosphotyrosine analogue , pNPP ( Table 1 ) .
Pervanadate abolished total as well as cytosolic and membrane PTPase activities in a dose-dependent manner .
Its effect was maximal at 100 4M .
Because CD45 is the most abundant PTPase on the T-cell surface , we tested the effects of pervanadate on CD45 activity .
Similarly to its effect on total PTPase activities , pervanadate inhibited the activity of immunoprecipitated CD45 in a dose-dependent manner .
Intact Jurkat cells had a low ecto-pNPP hydrolysis activity which was not inhibited by pervanadate ( not shown ) .
This activity may correspond to alkaline phosphatase and represented less than 20 % of membrane activity as calculated in CD4S5-deficient cells [ 22 ] .
It is unlikely that alkaline phosphatase is involved in pervanadate action , as its activity is not affected by the inhibitor .
Pervanadate induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Jurkat cellular proteins After activation , for 10 min , of intact Jurkat cells with various effectors , the pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in total cell lysates was analysed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies .
Figure 1 ( a ) shows that cell stimulation with pervanadate ( 1 mM ) dramatically increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a large number of proteins ( lane 3 ) compared with unstimulated cells ( lane 1 ) .
At the same concentration , vanadate alone had little effect on tyrosine phosphorylation ( lane 2 ) .
The most prominent substrates induced by pervanadate display molecular masses of 230 , 210 , 175 , 150 , 145 , 120 , 115 , 105 , 89 , 72 , 70 , 59 , 50 , 42 , 38 , 36 , 35 , 30 and 22 kDa .
The effect of pervanadate was dose-dependent : tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable at concentrations as low as 25 aM ( lane 6 ) and increased steeply up to 1 mM ( lane 3 ) .
In control conditions containing only catalase and H,0 , , without vanadate ( lane 7 ) , tyrosine phosphorylation levels were similar to those of unstimulated cells , demonstrating that the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation requires generation of pervanadate .
A time-course experiment ( Figure 1b ) showed that tyrosine phosphorylation was noticeable 1 min after addition of pervanadate ( lane 9 ) and peaked around 15 min ( lane 12 ) .
No Table 1 Intact cells were incubated with various concentrations of pervanadate , and PTPase activity was measured on total lysate or membrane or cytosolic fractions .
For CD45 PTPase activity , CD45 molecules were isolated by immunoprecipitation with mAbs .
The PTPase assay was performed on the phosphotyrosine analogue , pNPP , at 37 °C .
The release of p-nitrophenol was followed at 410 nm .
The data are representative of three independent experiments .

Cells were stimulated for the indicated times ( min ) with pervanadate ( 500 M ) .
Proteins from cell lysates were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membranes for Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies .
Binding of the antibody was revealed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody .
decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed up to 1 h of stimulation .
Figure 2 shows the effect of three different PTK inhibitors , namely genistein ( 100 M ) , staurosporine ( 50 nM ) and herbimycin A ( 10 M ) , on the < induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by pervanadate .
Genistein and staurosporine were preincubated for 10 min while herbimycin A was added to the cells 18 h before stimulation .
The inhibitors , especially herbimycin A , dramatically counteracted the effect of pervanadate .
However , complete inhibition was not observed probably because of the large effect of pervanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation .
In a control experiment , we verified that a protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitor , H7 , had no effect on induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by pervanadate ( not shown ) .
These results show that induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by pervanadate requires active PTK .
Pervanadate activates Ick and fyn tyrosine kinases Analysis of Ick and fyn activity was performed on immunoprecipitates from pervanadate-treated intact Jurkat cells .
As shown in Figure 3 , a 10 min stimulation with pervanadate induced a 4.3- and a 2.6-fold increase in kinase activity of Ick and fyn respectively .
An increase in autophosphorylation level of the kinases was also observed , as well as several retarded bands corresponding to different phosphorylated forms of the kinases .

The ratio 405/495 is displayed which corresponds to the intracellular free concentration .
the effect we observed was due to an increase in their specific activity .
Pervanadate induces Ca** influx and stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCy1 We then analysed the induction of Ca** fluxes in Indo-1-loaded Jurkat cells .
Figure 4 ( a ) shows that stimulation of the T-cell receptor with anti-CD3 mAb resulted in an increase in intracellular Ca®* concentration ( [ Ca® ] , ) , corresponding to a combination of a release from intracellular stores and an influx of external Ca®* into the cell .
Pervanadate also caused a rise in [ Ca `` ] ) , , which was slower than that observed with CD3 stimulation , but reached the same maximal value after 4-5 min .
Control stimulation without vanadate failed to induce any inward flux of Ca** .

dependent , with an EC ; , of approximately 50 « M ( Figure 4b ) .
As observed for tyrosine phosphorylation , pervanadate appeared to be more efficient than vanadate in increasing [ Ca®** ] , ( results not shown ) .
In the presence of the Ca®* chelator EGTA , CD3 stimulation resulted in a transient increase in [ Ca® `` ] , corresponding solely to the release of Ca** from intracellular stores , the Ca®*-influx contribution being abrogated ( Figure Sa ) .
In contrast , EGTA abolished the Ca®** response induced by pervanadate ( Figure 5b ) , demonstrating that this agent stimulated a Ca*®* influx only .
Release of Ca** from intracellular stores is mediated by IP , which results from hydrolysis of phosphoinositol bisphosphate by PLCyl .
We thus studied the effect of pervanadate on PLCy1 tyrosine phosphorylation by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting ( Figure 6 ) .
Stimulation with 200 4M pervanadate for 2 min increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCy1 ( Figure 6a ) .
Under the same conditions , pervanadate had no effect on the amount of PLCyl1 as determined by immunoprecipitation from [ **SJmethionine-labelled cells ( Figure 6b ) .

The effect of pervanadate and anti-CD3 mAb on [ Ca** ] , were equally blocked by preincubation with PTK inhibitors such as staurosporine ( 50 nM ) , genistein ( 100 4M , 5 min ) and herbimycin A ( 10 uM , 18 h ) ( results not shown ) .
Together , these observations show that pervanadate and anti-CD3 mAb regulate [ Ca®** ] , by different mechanisms that both imply active PTK entities .

Effect of pervanadate on a CD45-negative variant of Jurkat cells Because the steady-state level of phosphotyrosine on cellular proteins is the result of opposing activities of PTKs and PTPases and considering that CD45 is the predominant PTPase on the surface of T-cells , we studied the effects of pervanadate in a CD4S-deficient variant of Jurkat cells .
First , we compared tyrosine phosphorylation levels in Jurkat cells and the CD45-negative variant ( Figure 7 ) .
On unstimulated variant cells we noted the additional presence of a phosphotyrosine-containing 55 kDa protein and the absence of a 67 kDa protein .
Stimulation by pervanadate led to an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in both cell types .
The tyrosine-phosphorylated protein pattern resulting from pervanadate treatment appeared to be markedly lower in the CD4S5-negative variant than that observed in parental cells .
Interestingly , some phosphotyrosine proteins were missing in the variant ( arrowheads ) which could correspond to specific CD45 substrates .
These results indicate that the absence of the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase profoundly altered the effect that pervanadate exerts on tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates .
We next analysed Ca®** fluxes in the CD4S-negative variant ( Figure 8 ) .
As previously reported [ 22 ] , these variants display a lower response to TcR-CD3 stimulation due to a deficient coupling of the receptor with downstream signalling events .
The Ca** response to pervanadate was completely abolished in CD45-deficient cells even though a slight but significant response was still observed with CD3 stimulation .
Pervanadate induces c-fos mRNA accumulation Transcription of the early gene c-fos was investigated by Northern-blot analysis of total RNA prepared from Jurkat cells ( Figure 9 ) .
The level of RNA encoding the c-fos product largely increased after treatment of cells with PMA .
Pervanadate also induced c-fos mRNA , but at a lower level .
No synergistic effect was observed with a combination of pervanadate and PMA .
The treatments did not affect actin mRNA levels .
We then analysed expression of the c-fos gene by using a gene-reporter technique .
Jurkat cells were transfected with a plasmid carrying a luciferase indicator gene under the control of the c-fos promoter .
Activation of this promoter results in luciferase production .

Maximal stimulation was obtained with a combination of pervanadate and PMA ( 17-fold ) .
The compounds thus acted at a transcriptional level on the c-fos promoter .
The synergy between PMA and pervanadate on c-fos promoter was not observed on c-fos mRNA levels .
The difference could be attributed to the nature of the experiments : luciferase assays were performed after 18 h of stimulation to allow a sufficient accumulation of luciferase activity whereas cells were activated for only 30 min for Northern-blot analysis .
Induction of surface expression of the activation antigen CD69 by pervanadate Stimulation of the T-cell receptor results in expression of a large number of genes within a long time frame [ 42 ] .
One such gene encodes the early-activation antigen CD69 , the surface expression of which is induced within hours of TcR-CD3 stimulation [ 43 ] .
Although the function of CD69 in T-cell activation is not well understood , this antigen is a good marker of distal signal-transduction events .
Flow-cytometry analysis revealed that CD69 labelling on unstimulated cells ( Figure 10a ) displayed a fluorescence intensity similar to that observed when an irrelevant mAb is used ( not shown ) .
Stimulation with pervanadate resulted in only a marginal increase in CD69 levels ( Figure 10b ) .
PMA was more efficient at inducing CD69 expression ( Figure 10¢ ) and its action was synergized when used in combination with pervanadate ( Figure 10d ) .
Induction of CD69 by pervanadate was blocked by herbimycin A ( 10 4M ) ( not shown ) .
Pervanadate stimulates IL-2 production and surface expression of IL-2 receptor « -chain One of the most commonly used criteria to assess late T-cell-activation events is production of the lymphokine IL-2 [ 44 ] .
In Jurkat cells , induction of IL-2 gene expression requires engagement of the T-cell-antigen receptor by agonist mAb ( gen-erally anti-CD3 mAb ) together with a second signal provided by the phorbol ester PMA .
Stimulation of the TcR-CD3 complex can be mimicked by a Ca®* ionophore A23187 .

These data are representative of three independent experiments .

Pervanadate alone or in combination with PMA induced a dose-dependent IL-2 production .
It is notable that pervanadate , when used alone , was able to induce IL-2 secretion , although at a low level , whereas PMA alone failed to do so .
In a second experiment , we compared the effect of anti-CD3 mAb and pervanadate on IL-2 production .
Anti-CD3 mAb alone had no effect , whereas pervanadate alone ( 200 « M ) was able to induce IL-2 production ( 2 ng/ml ) .
When added together , the two compounds had a synergistic effect ( 5 ng/ml ) .
Co-stimulation of cells with either anti-CD3 mAb and PMA or pervanadate and PMA resulted in similar levels of IL-2 secretion ( respectively 9 and 11 ng/ml ) .
Higher IL-2 production was obtained with the combination anti-CD3 + PMA +pervanadate ( 16 ng/ml ) .
These results indicate that pervanadate induced IL-2 production alone or in synergy with PMA or anti-CD3 mAb .

and different concentrations of pervanadate ( pV ) .
An electrophoretic mobility-shift assay was performed with a radiolabelled oligonucleotide corresponding to the NF-xB-binding site of the IL-2 gene .
The positions of the unbound oligonucleotide ( free probe ) and the retarded DNA-protein complex are indicated by arrows .
We then analysed another late event of T-cell activation : expression at the surface of the IL-2 receptor « -chain ( CD25 ) [ 45 ] .
The results of a flow cytometry analysis are shown in Table 4 .
No IL-2 receptor could be detected on unstimulated cells .
Stimulation with pervanadate induced a small expression of CD25 ( 9 % of positive cells ) .
With PMA , levels of CD25 expression were higher ( 22 % ) .
Maximal induction of CD25 expression was produced by co-stimulation with pervanadate and PMA ( 45 % ) .
Together , these results show that inhibition of PTPases by pervanadate induced several late events of the T-cell activation process .
Pervanadate activates NF-xB We finally investigated activation of NF- « B , one of the nuclear factors involved in the regulation of IL-2 gene transcription [ 46,47 ] .
NF- « B is a heterodimer composed of two proteins , p50 and p65 [ 48,49 ] .
In unstimulated cells , with the notable exception of B-cells , NF- « B is retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex by an inhibitory protein , IxB , and can not bind DNA [ 50,51 ] .
In response to various stimuli , the IxB-NF- « B complex dissociates , and NF- « B-binding activity is detected in the nucleus [ 52 ] .
Activation of NF- « B-binding activity was measured in nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells stimulated with various effectors .
As shown in Figure 11 , a 1 h stimulation with A23187 plus PMA resulted in the appearance of two retarded bands corresponding to NF- « B .
Stimulation with PMA alone also resulted in NF- « B-binding activity .
Similarly , pervanadate could activate NF-KB in a dose-dependent manner and could potentiate Regulation of T-cell activation by protein tyrosine phosphatases 171 the effect of PMA .
Control stimulation containing only H , O , and catalase , without vanadate , failed to activate NF- « B , demonstrating that the activation of NF- « B requires generation of pervanadate ( not shown ) .
The effect of pervanadate on NF- « B DNA-binding activity was insensitive to addition of EGTA to the medium at concentrations that blocked pervanadate-induced Ca** fluxes .
We verified that NF- « B DNA-binding activity was insensitive to H7 , a PKC inhibitor , which prevented PMA-induced NF- « B activity .
However , the effect of pervanadate on NF- « B was abolished by herbimycin A , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( results not shown ) .
These results suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation may have an important role in regulation of NF- « B activation by a pathway that excludes the classical PKC-dependent regulation .
DISCUSSION In this paper , we have studied the role of PTPases in the regulation of T-cell activation , by using a powerful inhibitor of this family of enzymes ( pervanadate ) .
Pervanadate appeared to have stimulatory effects on various cell types including platelets , peripheral T-cells , neutrophils , adipocytes and tumour cell lines such as HL60 and CHO .
It is known that pervanadate acts by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins ( 26-32 , 53-55 ] .
We first verified that pervanadate inhibited total Jurkat cellular PTPase activity as well as that of immunoprecipitated CD45 .
We demonstrate here that PTPases are negative regulators of T-cell activation processes , as their inhibition by pervanadate induced early , as well as late , events of Jurkat activation .
The earliest detectable effect of pervanadate stimulation was an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a large number of cellular substrates .
Pervanadate appeared to be the most powerful promoter of tyrosine phosphorylation so far tested in human T-cells , allowing the visualization of numerous additional PTK/PTPase substrates , which were not observed with TeR-CD3 stimulation .
An earlier study [ 56 ] has shown that inhibition of T-cell PTPases by phenylarsine oxide enhanced TcR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins .
However , distal events could not be investigated in that study owing to the toxic effect of phenylarsine oxide .
The rapid and extensive effect of pervanadate on Jurkat cells demonstrates that PTPases must normally exert a tight control over tyrosine phosphorylation in T-lymphocytes .
It is not yet known whether the action of pervanadate results from inhibition of PTPases that oppose constitutively active PTK or indirect stimulation of PTK through unrestrained autophosphorylation .
In the first situation , the increased tyrosine phosphorylation results from the accumulation of phosphate in the absence of dephosphorylation reactions without any variation in kinase activities .
In contrast , the second situation implies an increase in the specific activity of the kinases .
This seems to be the case in our model , at least for the src-like PTKs Ick and fyn , the activities of which are stimulated by pervanadate .
This stimulation is probably involved in the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Jurkat cellular proteins induced by pervanadate .
Our results , obtained on intact cells , thus suggest that certain PTPases exert a negative effect on Ick and fyn activities .
One attractive candidate is CD45 , the major transmembrane PTPase expressed in T-cells .
However , CD45 has been shown , at least in vitro , to activate Ick and fyn through dephosphorylation of an inhibitory C-terminal phosphotyrosine sesidue ( Tyr-505 and Tyr-531 for Ick and fyn respectively ) [ 33-35 } .
According to this model , inhibition of CD45 by pervanadate would rather inhibit Ick and fyn .
Never theless , two reports have also described an increased tyrosine kinase activity of Ick in CD4S-negative variants of HPB ALL [ 57 ] and Jurkat cells [ 58 ] , indicating that CD45 could negatively regulate Ick .
Along the same line , we also measured a higher activity for Ick and fyn in our CD4S-negative variants ( V. Imbert and J.-F. Peyron , unpublished work ) .
Regulation of the kinases is thus likely to be more complex than the simplistic control of the phosphorylation status of Tyr-505 and Tyr-531 .
It is more likely that several PTPases , including CD45 , with possibly opposite effects , act on the kinases through modulation of different tyrosine-phosphorylation sites .
The role of individual PTPases such as CD45 in this response remains to be clarified .
A direct stimulatory effect of pervanadate on tyrosine kinases can be ruled out , as we did not observe any increase in kinase activity of purified Ick ( not shown ) .
In addition , pervanadate has been reported to be inactive on insulin and epidermal growth factor receptors bearing tyrosine kinase activity [ 27,32 ] .
We observed that cell stimulation with pervanadate resulted in an increased intracellular Ca** concentration and we showed that it was due to entry of Ca®* ions from the extracellular medium .
The response was blocked by PTK inhibitors ( not shown ) ruling out a trivial inhibition of a Ca** ATPase by pervanadate .
The Ca** response induced by pervanadate appeared to be different from that induced by anti-CD3 mAb which triggered both a mobilization of Ca** from intracellular stores and an influx .
This suggests that the effect of pervanadate may be independent of IP , production and PLCy1 phosphorylation but may instead be mediated by direct tyrosine phosphorylation of a Ca** channel or of a channel-regulatory molecule .
In support of this hypothesis , it has recently been demonstrated that T-cells transfected with the constitutive PTK v-src displayed a higher Ca®* baseline and a higher Ca®** response to T-cell receptor stimulation , whereas IP , levels were not affected [ 59 ] .
However , pervanadate did stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCy1 , even though it failed to induce Ca** release from internal stores .
Our data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCy1 is not sufficient by itself to activate the enzyme .
PLCy1 activation seems to necessitate TcR-CD3 aggregation which pervanadate may be unable to induce .
Looking to more distal events , we observed that pervanadate as well as PMA were able to induce c-fos mRNA expression by acting , at least in part , at a transcriptional level .
Pervanadate also triggered cell surface expression of two activation markers , CD69 and IL-2 receptor « -chain ( CD25 ) , and this effect was potentiated by PMA .
Secretion of IL-2 appears to be an important distal marker of cell activation .
IL-2 production by Jurkat cells requires the combination of two types of stimuli [ 60 ] .
Whereas one signal is produced by triggering the T-cell receptor , i.e .
with anti-CD3 mAb or by the use of a Ca** ionophore , the other is provided by the phorbol ester , PMA .
We report here that pervanadate was able by itself to induce IL-2 production , although at a low level .
Yet , when used in combination with either anti-CD3 mAb or PMA , its effect was amplified and produced maximal levels of IL-2 .
This suggests that induction of tyrosine phosphorylation is sufficient per se to initiate a complete activation process .
However , alternative pathways , for instance mimicked by PMA , are required to amplify the response .
Pervanadate was found to activate NF- « B , one of several transcription factors that regulate transcription of the IL-2 gene [ 46,61 ] .
The effect required generation of pervanadate and was not due to residual H,0 , , a potent inducer of NF- « B-binding activity [ 62 ] .
It was independent of Ca®* and PKC and was prevented by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A ( results not shown ) .
Similar results have been recently reported , showing 172 V. Imbert and others that IL-1 may activate NF- « B via an unknown signalling mechanism that excludes oxygen radicals and PKC activity [ 63 ] .
Phosphorylation reactions have been proposed to play a role in inducing dissociation of NF- « B from its cytosolic inhibitor IxB [ 51 ] , but to date no direct links have been suggested between tyrosine kinases and the transcription factor .
The results obtained with a PTPase inhibitor suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may play a role in NF- « B activation .
This potential role is currently under investigation in our laboratory .
In a first attempt to define more clearly the roles played by different cellular PTPases in the control of T-cell activation events , we made use of CD4S-deficient variants .
Interestingly , the variants failed to elicit Ca** influx in response to pervanadate .
Among the various PTPases that are likely to be inhibited by pervanadate , CD45 probably plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Ca** influx during cell activation .
Inhibition of CD45 phosphatase activity may stabilize a phosphotyrosine site on an active kinase or substrate which act as positive regulators of Ca `` influx .
Moreover , in the CD4S-negative variant , pervanadate failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins that may represent specific CD45 substrates .
Some of them may be involved in the regulation of Ca** fluxes .
Together , the data are in agreement with the potential function of PTPases as anti-oncogene products , where loss of a PTPase gene or inhibition of the product may be one of the steps leading to malignant cell transformation [ 64,65 ] .
The identification of the PTPases affected by pervanadate as well as their substrates is likely to give important clues on the mechanisms regulating T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation .
Pervanadate appears to be a powerful pharmacological agent for dissecting cellular activation events that are under the control of tyrosine phosphorylation .
