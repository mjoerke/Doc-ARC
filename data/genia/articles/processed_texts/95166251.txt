These two related genes share the evolutionarily conserved region encoding the Runt domain .
PEBP2 « B is the murine counterpart of human AML1 , which is located at the breakpoints of the 8 ; 21 and 3 ; 21 chromosome translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia .
Northern ( RNA ) blots of various adult mouse tissues revealed that the levels of expression of both genes were most prominent in the thymus .
Furthermore , transcripts of PEBP2 « 4 and mouse AMLI/PEBP2aB were detected in T lymphocytes in the thymuses from day 16 embryos and newborns , as well as 4-week-old adult mice , by in situ hybridization .
The expression of the genes persisted in peripheral lymph nodes of adult mice .
The transcripts were detected in all the CD4~ CD8~ , CD4¢ CD8* , CD4* CDS8~ , and CD4~ CD8 * cell populations .
The results indicated that both genes are expressed in T cells throughout their development , supporting the notion that PEBP2 is a T-cell-specific transcription factor .
Transcripts of mouse AMLI/PEBP2 « B were also detected in day 12 fetal hematopoietic liver and in the bone marrow cells of newborn mice .
The implication of mouse AMLI/PEBP2 « B expression in hematopoietic cells other than those of T-cell lineage is discussed in relation to myeloid leukemogenesis .
It is believed that T-lymphocyte-specific gene expression is achieved by the cooperation of a set of several transcription factors ( see reference 22 for a review ) .
Some of these are expressed specifically or mainly in T cells , whereas others are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues .
GATA3 ( 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 47 ) , TCFI/LEF-1 ( 33 , 40 , 41 , 44 , 45 ) , Ikaros ( 6 ) , and Ets-1 ( 11 ) are among those belonging to the former category , and the CREB/ATF family is of the latter ( 8 ) .
Their binding sequences have been identified in the enhancer elements of T-cell-specific genes such as the CD38 ( 6 ) and T-cell receptor ( TCR ) genes ( 22 ) .
We recently reported that the murine transcription factor PEBP2 is likely to be an important member of such transcription factors involved in T-cell-specific gene expression ( 30 , 32 ) .
PEBP2 was originally identified as a polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein which interacts with both the A and B cores ( 18 , 35 ) .
It is undetectable in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells and becomes detectable as the cells are induced to differenti-ate , suggesting that it is likely to be involved in the regulation of early mouse embryo development ( 5 ) .
Structurally , it is a heterodimer composed of « and B subunits ( 18 ) .
The « subunit bears a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity and recognizes the consensus sequence , Pu/TACCPuCA ( 32 ) .
The B subunit enhances the DNA-binding affinity of the « subunit through heterodimer formation ( 30 ) .
A 128-amino-acid region of the a subunit is highly homologous to the corresponding region of * Corresponding author .

1662 the Drosophila segmentation gene runt ( 19 ) .
The homologous region is termed the Runt domain , and it harbors the DNA-binding and heterodimerizing activities ( 17 , 32 ) .
There are two related but independent genes , PEBP2a4 and PEBP2eB , which encode the Runt domain ( 2 , 32 ) .
The notion that PEBP2 is likely to be involved in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation in the T-lymphocyte lineage is based on the following observations .
First , Northern ( RNA ) blots of the RNA revealed that PEBP2eaA was expressed at high levels in T-cell lines , whereas it was undetectable in the B-cell lines tested ( 32 ) .
Transcripts of the related gene , PEBP2aB , were also detected in the T-lymphocyte line as well as in some B-cell lines ( 2 ) .
Although the expression of these genes along with stages of differentiation of T and B cells has not been studied , it is noteworthy that they are expressed in all the T-cell lines tested so far .
Consistent with this observation , there is a PEBP2 site in the regulatory regions of many T-cell-specific genes , including the TCR genes « , B , y , and 8 ( 36 ) .
The aA and « B proteins , when exogenously expressed , indeed bind to the PEBP2 site of the TB3 and TB4 elements in the TCRB enhancer and stimulate the enhancer activity through the PEBP2 site ( 1 , 32 ) .
PEBP2 binds to the enhancer core sequence of murine leukemia virus ( 36 ) .
The wild-type Moloney or SL3-3 strain induces T-cell lymphoma when injected into newborn mice , whereas viruses carrying mutations in the enhancer core cause erythroleukemia after a prolonged latent period ( 9 , 37 ) .
Nuclear factors called core-binding factor ( CBF ) or SL3-3 enhancer factor 1 are equivalent to PEBP2 in their core-binding activity ( 39 , 42 ) .
Indeed the cDNA sequence of the CBF B-sub-unit gene ( 43 ) is identical to that of the PEBP2G gene ( 30 ) .
Recent studies have revealed a notable aspect of the T-cell-specific function of PEBP2/CBF .
In the TCRB enhancer , PEBP2/CBF-binding sites in the TB3 and TB4 ( or BE2 and Vou .
15 , 1995 BE3 ) elements are present near the regions where Ets-1 binds ( 22 ) .
The binding of these two factors is cooperative ( 46 ) .
Similarly , PEBP2/CBF and c-Myb cooperate for the T-cell-specific expression of TCR8 ( 10 ) .
While relative spacing and orientation of the PEBP2/CBF and Ets-1 sites are not important in the TCRB enhancer , the restriction on the spacing has to be much tighter between the PEBP2/CBF and c-Myb sites in the TCR8 enhancer for cooperation ( 10 , 46 ) .
These results suggest that PEBP2/CBF may indeed be involved in a combinatorial effect of several transcription factors to exert T-cell-specific transcription activation .
The possibility that PEBP2 also plays an important role in myeloid cells has been suggested in a remarkable way .
The human counterparts of both PEBP2a « B and PEBP2G , which encode entirely different polypeptides , are located at the breakpoints of chromosome translocations characteristic of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) .
The human gene AML1 , located on chromosome 21q22 , is identified at the breakpoints of t ( 8 ; 21 ) AML ( 4 , 26 , 27 ) and t ( 3 ; 21 ) therapy-related leukemia ( 25 , 29 ) .
PEBP2aB is the mouse homolog of AML 1 ( 1 , 2 ) .
The human gene encoding PEBP2/CBFRB is located at the breakpoints of the inversion of chromosome 16 ( 23 ) , and inv ( 16 ) is a karyotypic abnormality of another subtype of AML ( 21 ) .
AML1 has been shown by Northern blotting to be expressed in human bone marrow cells ( 26 ) .
In this study , we examined first whether the in vivo expression of PEBP2eA and mouse AML 1/a « B ( mAML1/a « B ) supports the notion that PEBP2/CBF is a T-cell-specific transcription factor .
The results indicated that both genes are expressed at the highest levels in thymuses of adult mice and that their transcripts are present in thymocytes throughout thymic development .
The expression of mA4ML1/aB in hematopoietic cells other than T cells was also examined in relation to myeloid leukemogenesis .
MATERIALS AND METHODS RNA extraction and Northern blotting .
Four-week-old male ICR and nude mice were purchased from Shimizu Experimental Materials ( Kyoto , Japan ) .
The animals were sacrificed under ether anesthesia , and then the fresh organs were quickly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen .
The organs were transferred into denaturing solution D ( 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate , 25 mM sodium citrate [ pH 7.0 ] , 0.5 % sarcosyl , 0.1 M 2-mercaptocethanol ) , homogenized in a Polytron , and then sonicated on ice .
RNAs were extracted with acid-guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform ( 3 ) .
Poly ( A ) * RNAs were selected by passage through an oligo ( dT ) -cellulose column once .
A 2.5-pg aliquot of poly ( A ) * RNA was separated on a 1 % agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred to a Hybond N membrane ( Amersham ) in 20 % SSC ( 1 % SSC is 150 mM NaCl plus 15 mM sodium citrate ) .
The probes used were as follows : the Neo !
( nucleotide [ nt ] 1293 ) -to-HindlII ( nt 1688 ) fragment of the PEBP2eA cDNA ( 32 ) , nt 1 to 1778 of the mAMLI/PEBP2 « B cDNA sequence ( 2 ) , and the EcoRI ( nt 1 ) -to-HindIII ( nt 1050 ) fragment of the PEBP2G cDNA ( 30 ) .
The blot was hybridized with *°P-labeled probes ( 10° cpm/m ! )
in a mixture containing 50 % formamide , 1 % Denhardt 's solution , 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 5 % SSC , 50 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7.0 ) , and 100 ug of denatured salmon sperm DNA per ml at 42°C for 16 h. The blot was washed once in 2 % SSC-0.1 % SDS for 30 min at room temperature and twice in 0.1 % SSC-0.1 % SDS for 30 min each time at 60°C and exposed to X-ray films .
Probes used for in situ hybridization .
Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled single-stranded RNA probes were prepared by using the DIG RNA labeling kit ( Bochr-inger Mannheim GmbH Biochemica , Mannheim , Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
To generate the PEBFP2e4 probe , for example , the Mlul ( nt 3991 ) -to-EcoRI ( nt 4662 ) fragment of the PEBP2eA cDNA ( 32 ) was subcloned into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of the Bluescript I pSK ( - ) plasmid .
This plasmid ( 1 pg ) was either linearized with BamHI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate an antisense probe or linearized with EcoRI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase to generate a sense probe .
The other cDNA sequences used for generating RNA probes were as follows : the Nof ] ( nt 1250 ) -to-HindIII ( nt 1688 ) fragment of PEBP2 « A cDNA ( 32 ) , the Drell ( nt 228 ) -to-BstEII ( nt 560 ) fragment of mAMLI/PEBP2 « B cDNA ( 2 ) , the BsiEl ( nt 395 ) -to-Sau3A ( nt 807 ) fragment of mAML1/PEBP2 « B , the BamHI ( nt 1038 ) -to-Drall ( nt 1350 ) fragment of mAML1/PEBP2aB , the Drall ( nt 1350 to 1670 ) EXPRESSION OF PEBP2 « GENES IN T CELLS 1663 fragment of mAMLI/PEBP2 « B , and the BamHI ( nt 928 to 1744 ) fragment of murine GATA3 cDNA ( 20 ) .
All these cDNA sequences were subcloned in pSK ( - ) , linearized with appropriate enzymes , and transcribed by either T7 or T3 RNA polymerase .
After transcription , 40 U of RNase-free DNase was added to the reaction mixture , and the mixture was incubated for a further 10 min at 37°C .
Transcription products were ethanol precipitated and dissolved in distilled water .
In situ hybridization histochemistry .
Hybridization proceeded as described ( 28 ) .
( i ) Tissue preparation .
The mouse organs were fixed with fresh 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7.0 ( PB ) , at 4°C for 16 h. They were successively dehydrated with 70 , 80 , 90 , and 99.5 % ethanol and then embedded in paraffin .
Sections were cut on a microtome and mounted on 3- ( triethoxylosilyl ) -propylamine ( Merck , Schuchardt , Munich , Germany ) -coated glass slides .
They were stored at 4°C until use .
( ii ) Preparation of the sections .
After the sections were dried , the paraffin was removed by successively immersing the sections in xylene and 99.5 , 90 , 80 , and 70 % ethanol .
They were rinsed once in PB and postfixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PB for 15 min .
After being rinsed in PB , the sections were incubated with 1 jg of proteinase K ( Boehringer Mannheim ) per ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) -1 mM EDTA for 30 min at 37°C .
They were fixed again in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PB for 10 min .
After a rinse with PB and equilibration with 0.1 M triethanolamine-HCl buffer ( pH 8.0 ) , the sections were acetylated with fresh 0.25 % acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine-HCl buffer ( pH 8.0 ) for 10 min .
They were dehydrated by passage through PB and 70 , 80 , 90 , and 99.5 % ethanol and then air dried .
( iii ) Hybridization and washing .
The hybridization solution contained 50 % formamide , 10 % dextran sulfate , 1X Denhardt 's solution , 600 mM NaCl , 0.25 % SDS , 10 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.6 ) , 250 ug of Escherichia coli tRNA per ml , 10 mM dithiothreitol and an appropriately diluted digoxigenin-UTP-labeled RNA probe .
Hybridization was carried out at 50°C for 16 h in a moisture chamber .
After hybridization , the sections were preincubated in 5 % SSC at 50°C and then in 50 % formamide-2X SSC at 50°C for 30 min to remove excess probe .
They were then incubated in TNE ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.6 ] , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA ) buffer for 10 min and with 10 ug of RNase A per ml in TNE buffer for 30 min at 37°C .
To remove digested RNA , the slides were incubated in 2 % SSC for 20 min once and in 0.2 % SSC for 20 min twice at 50°C .
( iv ) Immunodetection of hybridized probe .
The sections were incubated in DIG buffer 1 ( 100 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 150 mM NaCl ) for 2 min and then with 1.5 % blocking reagent in DIG buffer 1 for 60 min .
They were next incubated in polyclonal sheep antidigoxigenin Fab fragment diluted 1:500 in DIG buffer 1 for 60 min .
The sections were washed with DIG buffer 1 for 15 min twice and equilibrated with DIG buffer 3 ( 100 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 9.5 ] , 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM MgCl ; ) .
The color was developed by incubating the sections with 337.5 ug of nitroblue tetrazolium and 165 pg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate toluidinium ( BCIP ) in DIG buffer 3 at 37°C until the signal/noise ratio reached a maximum .
The reaction was stopped by rinsing the sections with a 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) -2 mM EDTA solution .
The slides were mounted with Crystal Mount ( Biomeda Corp. , Foster City , Calif. ) .
If necessary , the coverslips were dislodged by immersing the slides in water for several days and the sections were stained with hematoxylin .
Cell sorting .
Thymocytes obtained from 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody to CD4 ( Rm4-5 ; Pharmingen , San Diego , Calif. ) and biotinylated monoclonal antibody to CD8 ( 53-6-72 ; Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems , San Jose , Calif. ) followed by phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin ( Bethesda Research Laborato-ries , Gaithersburg , Md . )
.
The cells were stained in the presence of a monoclonal antibody to the Fey receptor ( 2.4G2 ) to block nonspecific binding via the Fey receptor .
CD4~ CD87 , CD4* CD8 # , CD4~ CD8* , and CD4* CD8~ populations of thymocytes were electronically sorted by using a FACS Vantage cell sorter ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Cells were sorted in the presence of propidium iodide to exclude dead cells .
The purity of each population was 98 % in this study .
RESULTS Northern blot analysis of the transcripts of the PEBP2 « and -B genes .
Poly ( A ) RNAs prepared from various organs of 4-week-old adult mice were analyzed by Northern blotting ( Fig .
1 ) .
As an internal control , the B-actin gene was expressed ( Fig .
1D ) , which indicated that relatively uniform amounts of RNAs were loaded in the lanes in Fig .
1 .
PEBP2eA transcripts of 4.7 and 2.1 kb were detected in the thymus , whereas only a 2.4-kb transcript was observed in the testis .
No other tissues tested expressed « 4 at a detectable level .
As reported previously ( 32 ) , much larger transcripts ( 7.4-and 6.3-kb RNAs ) were detected in mouse T-cell lines EL4 and BWS5147 as well as in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts .
The significance of the difference in the size of the od transcripts is not clear at 1664 SATAKE ET AL .

present .
The levels of expression of « 4 in thymus and testis were lower than those in NIH 3T3 cells .
The four major sizes of m14MLI/PEBP2aB transcripts , 7.9 , 6.2 , 3.8 , and 2.1 kb , were detected in the thymus ( Fig .
1B ) .
RNAs of similar sizes have been detected in T-cell lines ( 2 ) .
Relatively small amounts of the 7.9- , 3.8- , and 2.1-kb transcripts were detected in the lung , heart , and testis .
In the spleen , only the 2.1-kb transcript was evident , and its significance will be described later .
A subset of the transcripts , 7.9-and 3.8-kb RNAs , were detected in NIH 3T3 cells as reported previously ( 2 ) .
With respect to the relative amounts of RNAs , comparable amounts of the mAML1/aB transcripts were detected in the thymus and NIH 3T3 cells .
These results indicated that the expression of « 4 and mAML1/aB is tissue type dependent and that the thymus is one of the main tissues expressing both « 14 and in abundance .
In contrast , the 3.0- and 2.5-kb transcripts of PEBP2/CBFG were detected in all the tissues examined at relatively uniform levels ( Fig .
1C ) .
This finding is analogous to that showing the ubiquitous expression of PEBP2/CBFG in various types of cultured cells ( 30 ) .
The two sizes of RNAs are likely to be due to alternative polyadenylations as shown in the RNAs obtained from NIH 3T3 cells ( 30 ) .
The nature of the two additional smaller transcripts in the testis is unclear at present .
The expression profile of PEBP2/CBFBG shown in Fig .
1 is in general agreement with that reported by others ( 43 ) .
PEBP2a expression in the thymus and lymph nodes as detected by in situ hybridization .
The thymus , along with neigh boring tissues , was dissected from day 16 mouse embryos , and the expression of « 4 and mAML1/aB was examined by means of in situ hybridization ( Fig .
2 ) .
Expression of the gene for the known T-cell-specific transcription factor GATA3 was examined in parallel .
Weak but positive signals were detected in the thymus by the « 4 probe ( Fig .
2A ) .
Much stronger signals were detected by the mAML1/ « B and GATA3 probes in the thymus ( Fig .
2B and C , respectively ) .
On fetal day 12 , T-cell precursors are homing to the thymus , and surface expression of the « B TCR proteins starts to be detected on day 16 .
If the positive signals in the thymus ( Fig .
2A and B ) are indeed due to reactions in the thymocytes themselves , the result suggests that od and mAML1/aB are expressed during a relatively early period of T-cell development .
Results similar to those described above were obtained for the thymuses taken from newborn mice : a weak but positive signal for « 4 and a strong signal for m4ML1/aB and GATA3 .
The staining profile of mA4ML1/ « B is shown in Fig .
3A as an example .
When viewed at a higher magnification ( Fig .
3B ) , most of the cells are positive for the signal .
By microscopic observation of the identical section after hematoxylyn staining , the cells positive for the signal were found to be small , containing little cytoplasm with densely stained nuclei , all of which are morphological characteristics of lymphocytes ( data not shown ) .
It is likely , therefore , that the cells positive for the mAML1/aB expression represent T lymphocytes rather than stromal cells .

signal became prominent compared with that from fetal thymus ( Fig .
4A ) .
The signals of m4MLI/a « B ( Fig .
4B ) and GATA3 ( Fig .
4C ) remained intensely positive .
The signals from the transcripts appeared to be stronger in the cortex than in the medulla in the adult thymus ( Fig .
4B ) , although the data were of a qualitative , not a quantitative , nature .
Since the cortex is the site where T cells rapidly proliferate and undergo positive selection , the expression of a4 and mAML1/aB may be correlated with cell proliferation .
After maturation , T cells enter the medulla and are then distributed to peripheral organs such as the lymph nodes .
In those from the inguinal region of adult mice , a strong signal was EXPRESSION OF PEBP2 « GENES IN T CELLS 1665 detected for mAML1/a « B ( Fig .
5B ) , whereas the oA ( Fig .
5A ) and GATA3 ( Fig .
5C ) probes gave moderate signals .
In all of the studies shown in Fig .
2 through 5 , the specificity of the positive signals was confirmed by the following criteria .
( i ) The antisense probes gave the signals , but the corresponding sense probes did not .
For example , the sense probe for mAML1/a B did not generate signals in the thymus ( Fig .
4D ) or lymph nodes ( Fig .
5D ) .
( ii ) The antisense probes that represented different portions of the respective cDNA sequences gave the same staining profile .
For the a4 or mAML1I/oB probe , two or four different parts of the cDNA sequences , respectively , were selected to synthesize antisense probes .
Among those , the sequences spanning nt 1250 through 1688 of oA cDNA and nt 228 through 807 of m4ML1/aB cDNA contained the Runt domain-encoding regions ( see Materials and Methods for the nucleotide numbers ) .
On the other hand , the sequences spanning nt 3991 through 4662 of a4 and nt 1038 through 1670 of m4 ML 1/aB did not contain the Runt domain-encoding regions .
They had no homology .
Therefore , the signals detected by the unique region probes must have represented the specific transcripts of « 14 and mA4ML1/aB .
The low level of a4 signals , therefore , was not due to the cross-hybrid-ization of the probe with the transcripts of mAML1/aB .
Ribo-nucleotide probes representing the unique regions of « 4 and mAML1/aB ( nt 3991 through 4662 of « A and nt 1038 through 1670 of mAML1/aB ) were used in all the in situ hybridization experiments described herein .
( iii ) Cultured COS7 cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing « 4 or mAML1/ « B and processed for in situ hybridization .
Only the antisense probe generated signals in transfected cells but not in untransfected cells ( data not shown ) .
PEBP2a expression in sorted thymocytes .
Thymocytes were prepared from the thymuses of adult mice and sorted into four subpopulations by using the surface markers CD4 and CD8 .
The cell pellets from each subpopulation were processed for in situ hybridization .
As shown in Fig .
6 , the ad transcripts were detected in CD4~ CD8~ , CD4* CD8¢ , CD4~ CD8 , and CD4* CD8~ subpopulations by the antisense probe , whereas the sense probe did not produce positive signals .
The antisense but not the sense probe produced positive signals for mAML1/aB in all subpopulations as well ( data not shown ) .
These results established that the cells expressing « 4 and mAML1/aB in the thymus represent T lymphocytes and that both « 4 and mA4ML1/aB are expressed in T cells regardless of the expression of CD4 and CD8 molecules .
Expression of m { AMLI/PEBP2 « @ B in fetal liver and in bone marrow cells .
The result of the Northern blot analysis of various tissues shown in Fig .
1 revealed that is also expressed in the spleen , although more weakly than in the thymus .
This result raised the question as to whether the cells in the spleen which express mAML1/aB are T cells or of other lineages .
As shown in Fig .
7 , the 2.1-kb transcript of mAML1/aB was detected by Northern blotting in samples of the spleens taken from nude mice .
In this case , the level of expression of mA4ML1/aB was comparable to that in the thymuses from normal mice .
At the moment , the significance of the apparent difference in the level of the mAML1/ « B expression in the spleen between normal and athymic mice is unclear .
The significance of the predominant expression of the 2.1-kb transcript of m4ML1/aB in spleen cells or the structure of mAML1/aB protein encoded by the 2.1-kb transcript is also unclear at present .
T lymphocytes are excluded from the hematopoietic cells in nude mice , while erythroblasts and B lymphocytes constitute a major population of hematopoietic spleen cells .
Clearly , these or some other spleen cells different from the T-cell population must also express m14ML1/a.B .

Lower ( A ) and higher ( B ) magnifications are shown .
We further investigated the expression of mA4ML1I/aB in fetal liver and bone marrow .
Poly ( A ) RNA was prepared from the livers of day 12 embryos and hybridized with the mAML1/aB probe .
The sizes of the mAML1/aB transcripts were similar to those in the adult thymus ( Fig .
7 ) .
This is in contrast to the lack of expression of mAML1/aB in the liver of adult mice ( Fig .
1 ) .
We determined by means of in situ hybridization whether hepatocytes or hematopoietic cells in the liver of the day 12 embryo express mA ML 1/a.B .
There were positive signals detected for mAML1/aB ( Fig .
8A ) .
Some examples of positive cells are indicated by arrows .
After hybridization , the same section was stained with hematoxylin ( Fig .
8B ) .
We compared the corresponding cells in a set of stained sections and found that large cells with lightly stained nuclei that represent primitive hepatocytes were negative for the signal .
This is consistent with the result shown in Fig .
1 , indicating that liver cells do not express mA4ML1I/aB .
The cells possessing densely stained nuclei are of hematopoietic lineage .
A significant proportion of these cells were positive for the signal .
A large population of cells of hematopoietic lineage in the fetal liver are erythroid ( 14 ) .
The results shown above indicated that other hematopoietic cells in addition to T lymphocytes express mAML1/a B .
Bone marrow cells were prepared from the ribs of newborn mice , and the expression of mAMLI/aB was examined by means of in situ hybridization ( Fig .
9A ) .
The same section was stained with hematoxylin after hybridization ( Fig .
9B ) .
The positive cells ( indicated by arrows ) were large and contained large and lightly stained nuclei .
They were considered to represent either erythroblasts or myeloblasts .
Typical mature granulocytes that possessed doughnut-shaped nuclei were negative for the signal .
These results indicated that mAMLI/aB is expressed in either erythroblasts or myeloblasts or both .

Detection of the transcripts of PEBP2 « 4 ( A ) , mAML1/PEBP2 « B ( B ) , and GATA3 ( C ) in an inguinal lymph node from an adult mouse by means of in situ hybridization .
( D ) A sense probe for mAMLI/PEBP2 « B was used .
DISCUSSION This study showed that both the PEBP2aA and mAML1/aB genes are expressed throughout thymic T-cell development and in all of the T-cell subpopulations tested .
These results are consistent with our conclusion that PEBP2 is involved in the regulation of T-cell-specific gene expression ( 32 ) .
It is generally believed that the T-cell-specific transcriptional regulation is achieved by means of the combinatorial effect of antisense sense 1 C a < r * > 0 § , : ~ : _ ; A $ 4 ® a & a yt + € } Sane C `` * rug .
+ k $ r 3 : D as O * * ab u % s a set of T-cell-specific and more general transcription factors ( 22 ) .
From this premise , it is important to examine whether PEBP2/CBF cooperates with other transcription factors , especially with those that are known to be T-cell specific .
PEBP2/ CBF stabilizes the binding of Ets-1 to DNA by binding to the PEBP2/CBF site located near that of Ets-1 site in the TCRB enhancer ( 46 ) .
This notion of cooperativity of the in vitro binding is further strengthened by the results showing that the antisense sense 4 ) c < P 0 | y* 02 e ‘ L ’ Ge U CO b < p o [ & ] o FIG .

Poly ( A ) * RNA was prepared from spleens of adult nude mice and from day 12 fetal livers of ICR mice and separated on an agarose gel containing formaldehyde .
Poly ( A ) * RNA from the thymuses of adult ICR mice was run in parallel .
The blot was hybridized with the mAMLI/PEBP2 « B probe .
Locations of the 28 $ and 188 rRNAs are indicated .
two factors cooperatively stimulated transcription through the TB3 and TBA elements of the TCRB enhancer in vivo ( 31 ) .
Ets-1 functionally cooperates with another lymphoid-specific factor , LEF-1 , in the TCRa enhancer in a context-dependent manner ( 7 ) .
It will be of interest to examine the relationship among PEBP2/CBF , Ets-1 , and LEF-1 that results in cooperativity in the T-cell-specific transcriptional regulation .

The expression profile of « 4 and mAML1/ « B in the thymus was quite similar to that of the GATA3 gene .
Transcripts of all of them were detected throughout the T-cell ontogeny examined .
GATA3 binds to the Ta3 element of the TCRa enhancer ( 12 ) , to the TB2 element of the TCRB enhancer ( 24 ) , and to the 8E1 and 3E4 sites of the TCR8 enhancer ( 16 , 20 ) .
The PEBP2/CBF site is present in the Ta4 element of the TCRa enhancer , TB3 and TB4 elements in the TCRB enhancer , the 8E3 element of the TCR8 enhancer , and the NF-y1 , NF-y3 , and NF-y4 elements of the TCRy enhancer ( 22 , 36 ) .
PEBP2/ CBF- and GATA3-binding sites are not always concurrently present in the same core elements in the TCR enhancers .
Both PEBP2/CBF and GATA3 may contribute to the T-cell-specific transcriptional regulation by interacting with other factors .
The several species of the mAMLI/PEBP2aB transcripts ( 7.9 , 6.2 , 3.8 , and 2.1 kb ) found in the thymus appeared to be similar in size to those found in several mouse hematopoietic cell lines , including T- and human myeloid leukemia cell lines , as well as bone marrow cells ( 2 , 26 ) .
We observed that the 7.9-and 3.8-kb transcripts present in fibroblasts exclusively encode PEBP2 « B2 ( mAML1-387 ) and « B1 ( mAML1-451 ) proteins , respectively ( 1 ) .
The « B1 { ( mAML1-451 ) and « B2 ( mAML1-387 ) proteins are isoforms and show a distinct DNA-binding ability and transcriptional activation , suggesting that relative amounts of the two proteins in a given cell are important to determine the level of transcription ( 1 , 38 ) .
Considering the fact that several species of the transcripts were detected in the thymus , it is possible that a more complex interaction among multiple isoforms of the mAML1/aB protein takes place in T cells .
It is important , therefore , to examine whether the 6.2- and 2.1-kb transcripts that were detected in the thymus but not in fibroblasts can encode distinct polypeptides other than the reported « B1 ( mAML1-451 ) and « B2 ( mAML1-387 ) proteins .
The origin and the differentiation potential of T-cell precursors are different in early fetal life and adulthood ( hematopoi-etic liver in the fetus and bone marrow in adults ) ( 14 ) .
Transcripts of both the « 4 and mAML1/ « B genes were detected in the thymus from day 16 embryos and in CD4~ CD8~ thymocytes from the adult thymus , implying the relatively early onset of the expression of « 4 and mAML1/a « B during T-cell matu- FIG .

The T cells expressing y/8 TCRs appear at earlier stages of T-cell development than the « /B cells ( 13 , 15 ) .
Although the PEBP2/CBF site in the enhancer of TCR8 plays an essential role in the TCR8 enhancer activity in Jurkat T cells ( 10 ) , the data presented here did not directly show whether the y/8 cells express « 4 and mAML1/a.B .
It will be of interest to determine whether PEBP2/CBF plays some roles in T-cell development from the stem cells of both fetal liver and bone marrow origins .
The expression of m14 ML 1/aB is not limited to cells of T-cell lineage , since its transcripts were detected in spleens from nude mice which are devoid of T cells .
In fact the m4ML1/oB transcripts were detected in hematopoietic cells in the day 12 fetal liver .
Although the lineage of signal-positive cells was not identified , they represented a significant number in the section examined .
Since about 80 % of hematopoietic cells present in the fetal liver are considered to be erythroblasts ( 14 ) , it is likely that erythroblasts express mAMLI/a.B , although the possibility can not be excluded that the cells in other lineages also express the gene .
We also detected positive signals for the mA4ML1/oB transcripts in some bone marrow cells from newborn mice by in situ hybridization .
As mentioned above , AML ] is located at the breakpoints of t ( 8 ; 21 ) and t ( 3 ; 21 ) associated with AML ( 4 , 25-27 , 29 ) .
In bone marrow , mAML1/aB was expressed in rapidly growing cells at the blast stage , probably myeloblasts and/or erythroblasts , but it appeared to be down-regulated in mature granulocytes .
This finding suggests that the proto-on-cogene AML1 is expressed at some specific stage during the myeloid lineage differentiation .
The chimeric protein AML1/ MTGS ( ETO ) , which is generated as a result of t ( 8 ; 21 ) and is expressed in leukemic cells carrying t ( 8 ; 21 ) , contributes to the maintenance of the proliferation potential of the leukemic cells apparently by inhibiting their differentiation ( 34 ) .
An attractive model would be that a chimeric protein exerts the above effects by interfering with the function of AML1 protein .
More detailed analyses of the AML1I/aB gene expression along with hematopoietic cell differentiation will be necessary for a more precise understanding of the mechanism of myeloid leukemogenesis .
