Summary The human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Rev protein is essential for viral structural protein expression ( Gag , Pol , and Env ) and , hence , for viral replication .
In transient transfection assays , mutant forms of Rev have been identified that inhibit wild-type Rev activity and therefore suppress viral replication .
To determine whether such transdominant Rev proteins could provide long-term protection against HIV infection without affecting T cell function , T leukemia cell lines were stably transduced with a retroviral vector encoding a transdominant mutant of the Rev protein , M10 .
While all the M10-expressing cell lines remained infectable by HIV-1 , these same cells failed to support a productive replication cycle when infected with a cloned isolate of HIV-1 .
In addition , two out of three M10-expressing CEM clones were also resistant to highly productive infection by a heterogeneous HIV-1 pool .
Expression of M10 did not affect induction of HIV transcription mediated by the xB regulatory element or Tat .
Importantly , constitutive expression of Rev M10 did not alter the secretion of interleukin 2 in response to mitogen stimulation of EL-4 and Jurkat cells .
The inhibition of HIV infection in cells stably expressing a transdominant Rev protein , in the absence of any deleterious effect on T cell function , suggests that such a strategy could provide a therapeutic effect in the T lymphocytes of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients .
Rplication of human retroviruses , unlike that of their avian and murine counterparts , is dependent upon virally encoded transactivator proteins .
These proteins function by specifically modulating host cell processes and must , therefore , interact with host cell factors .
One approach to the inhibition of retroviral infection is to express transdominant forms of viral transactivators that interfere with their function ( 1 , 2 ) .
However , should inhibition be achieved by the interaction of the mutant protein with a factor essential for normal cell function , then such a strategy becomes contrain-dicated .
The HIV-1 Rev protein is encoded by a fully spliced viral mRNA synthesized early in virus infection ( 3 ) .
Rev activates the cytoplasmic expression of unspliced viral mRNAs ( 4-7 ) , presumably interacts with host cell factors ( 8-11 ) , and may be important for regulating virus latency ( 11 , 12 ) .
Towards the COOH terminus of Rev , there is a well-conserved leucine-rich domain that is absolutely essential for function ( 13-16 ) .
Mutations in this region give rise to defective proteins that are transdominant inhibitors of Rev function in transient transfection assays ( 13-16 ) .
In vitro analyses have suggested that inhibition occurs by the formation of nonfunctional hetero-meric Rev multimers unable to interact with the host cell factors required for the cytoplasmic expression of unspliced viral mRNAs ( 17 ) .
Together , these observations suggest that the expression of transdominant negative mutants of Rev may represent a potential strategy for anti-HIV therapy .
In this report , the effects of stable expression of a Rev transdominant , M10 , in leukemic T cell lines are examined .
Materials and Methods Preparation of Retroviral Vectors and Cell Transduction .
'The PLJ plasmid ( 18 ) was digested with BamHI , filled in with Klenow , and digested with Sall .
This fragment was ligated to a 592-bp insert derived from GST/M10 ( 17 ) , prepared by digestion with Ncol , incubation with Klenow enzyme , followed by digestion with Xhol .
The PLJ cRév M10 plasmid was introduced by calcium phosphate transfection into the ecotropic yCRE virus-packaging cell line ( 19 ) .

24 clones were analyzed by titration for G418 resistance , and three producer clones were selected with titers of Viral supernatants were incubated with CEM , Jurkat , and EL-4 cells ( 5 x for 4-8 h each day on four consecutive days , with cells maintained otherwise in RPMI 1640 with 10 % FCS .
Cells were selected in G418 ( 1.0 mg/ml ) and subclones of G418-resistant CEM cells were isolated by limiting dilution .
Subclones were tested for PLJ-cREV M1O provirus by Southern blot analysis by digesting high molecular weight DNA with Xbal and probing for a 4.49-kb fragment with the 592-bp cREV M10 in-sert .
As a control , CEM cells were transduced with a B-galactosidase retroviral vector that confers G418 resistance , BAG , as previously described ( 20 , 21 ) .
Construction of pIIHIB/CAT .
- The replication-competent , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) -expressing proviral clone , pHIB/CAT , is similar in design to vectors described previously by Terwilliger et al .
( 22 ) .
In pIIIB/CAT , the CAT gene has replaced the 5 `` portion of the viral nef gene and is therefore , like Nef , expressed independent of Rev .
To construct this vector , an Ncol site was introduced at the initiation codon of nef in the pHIB proviral clone ( 23 ) by targeted mutagenesis ( AGATGG-ACCATGG ) .
A 681-bp Ncol-Asp718 CAT gene fragment was generated by digesting the products of a PCR that had been performed with primers designed to introduce these sites at the 5 `` and 3 ' ends of CAT .
This fragment was inserted between the introduced Ncol site and the Asp718 site ( HXB-3 isolate , sequence coordinates 8374 and 8593 , respectively ) 70 bp upstream of the 5 boundary of the 3 ' LTR U3 region .
To partially compensate for the increased length of the virus genome , the sequences of the 3 ' LTR U3 region between the EcoRV sites ( sequence coordinates 8698 and 8998 ) were deleted .
The net increase in genome length is therefore only 163 nucleotides .
Cell Culture and HIV Infection .

Cells were maintained at 0.5-2.5 x 10° cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS .
Virus replication was monitored over a 4-wk period using an ELISA system for soluble p24® expression ( DuPont , NEN , Inc. , Billerica , MA ) .
CAT activity was measured 48 h after infection after repeated ( four ) cell washes .
As a negative control , virus was heat inactivated by incubation at 56°C for 60 min .
IL-2 Secretion .
- Tl-2 gene expression was stimulated by the addition of PMA ( 40 nM ) in EL4 cells or PMA ( 40 nM ) , and PHA 1 ug/ml ) in Jurkat cells .
Supernatant was collected 24 h after stimulation .
Secreted IL-2 in culture supernatants was measured with the IL-2-dependent CTLL cell line and a colorimetric assay ( see Fig .
4 ) .
Cell proliferation expressed as ODs ; » is on the ordinate .
The concentration of supernatant in uninduced ( - ) or stimulated ( + ) EL4 or Jurkat cells was 10 % .

Results An amphotropic retroviral vector that encodes the M10 mutant of Rev , as well as a control vector expressing B-galac-tosidase , were used to stably transduce the leukemic T cell lines CEM , EL-4 , and Jurkat .
To analyze the effects of constitutive Rev M10 expression in long-term cell culture , subclones derived from the CEM-transduced cells were estab-lished .
Immunoprecipitation analysis with an anti-Rev antiserum confirmed that subclones 3 , 4 , and 5 , but not the control cells , expressed the transdominant Rev protein ( data not shown ) .

- Susceptibility of CEM cells to initial infection by HIV-1 .
The indicated CEM subclones ( 5 x 105 cells ) were either mock infected with media alone , infected with heat-inactivated ( HI ) virus , or infected with virus derived from pIHB/CAT .
Cells were maintained as described in the legend to Fig .

Results are representative of two independent experiments .
a productive infection of HIV-1 .
All three Rev M10-expressing subclones were highly resistant to productive infection with virus generated from a molecular clone ( Fig .
1 A ) ( 23 ) .
In contrast , cells transduced with the B-galactosidase vector were similar in susceptibility to nontransduced CEM cells ( Fig .
1 A , and data not shown ) .
When infected with the heterogeneous HTLV-IIIB pool ( 24 ) , two of the M10-expressing CEM subclones displayed resistance to highly productive infection ( subclones 3 and 5 , Fig .
1 B ) .

In contrast , subclone 4 displayed only a slight delay in the pattern of viral spread relative to control cells .
We have recently reconfirmed the validity of transdominant Rev-mediated protection of cells against HIV infection using an alternative transdominent mutant of Rev , M32 ( 11 ) , CEM-SS cells ( 25 ) , and a double-copy retroviral vector , N2A ( 26 ) ( data not shown ) .
If the observed resistance of the CEM cells to productive HIV-1 infection was a direct consequence of Rev M10 ex-pression , then the cells should still be susceptible to initial infection .
To address this issue , a proviral expression vector pliIB/CAT was constructed in which the viral nef gene was replaced with the bacterial CAT gene .
Because the Nef protein is expressed early after HIV-1 infection and is therefore independent of Rev ( 3 ) , it is predicted that , in cells infected with pHHIB/CAT virus , the induction of CAT activity shortly after exposure to virus would be a measure of early viral gene expression and , hence , the number of infectious events .
As anticipated , all the CEM lines expressed readily detectable CAT activity 48 h after infection with the pHIB/CAT virus ( Fig .
2 ) .
No increase in CAT activity was detected in cells infected with heat-inactivated ( HI ) virus relative to mock-infected cells , thus demonstrating that detection of CAT was a consequence of retroviral infection and not residual inoculum .
To evaluate the effect of Rev M10 on T cell function , the CEM subclones were transfected with HIV-CAT reporter plasmids .
Mitogen and cytokine induction of the HIV LTR is dependent on an 11-bp sequence recognized by the NF-KB transcription factor ( 27 ) .
To determine whether the sensitivity of the HIV LTR to NF- « xB was affected by the M10 mutant , CAT activity in each CEM subclone was determined after PMA induction .
Activation mediated by the KB site was indistinguishable between the three subclones of CEM M10 , compared with the B-galactosidase control ( Fig .
3 A ) .
In addition , stimulation by the HIV-1 Tat protein , through the TAR region of the HIV-CAT reporter , was also unaffected in subclones that stably express M10 protein ( Fig .
3 B ) .

examine more thoroughly the effect of constitutive M10 expression on the immune function of cells , transduced Jurkat and EL-4 cell lines were evaluated for their ability to secrete II-2 after mitogen activation .
No difference was observed with respect to IL-2 secretion in either cell compared to controls ( Fig .
4 ) , thus demonstrating that induction of this lymphokine in cells that stably expressed the Rev transdominant protein is unaffected .
Discussion The introduction into susceptible cells of mutant forms of HIV-1 proteins that then interfere with viral replication represents an attractive approach to the treatment of HIV-1 infection ( 1 , 2 ) .
Although analogues of HIV-1 nucleic acid structures , such as TAR or RRE , have been used to inhibit HIV replication in cells ( 28 ) , the potential of mutant viral proteins to achieve this effect , and their ability to interfere with normal cellular function , remain unknown .
Here we demonstrate a substantial inhibition of HIV-1 replication in the majority of T cells that constitutively express the Rev M10 transdominant mutant .
In addition , we show that the transdominant Rev-expressing lines vary in their initial sus- ceptibility to HIV-1 infection by no more than twofold relative to the control , BAG-expressing , cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
These data support the conclusion , therefore , that resistance of the CEM cells to HIV-1 infection is directly due to the M10 protein , which inhibits productive infection by preventing expression of viral structural proteins .
The mechanism of Rev M10 protection has been analyzed previously ( 17 ) .
The RNA binding and multimerization domains of M10 are intact , suggesting that the Rev M10 multimerizes and precludes the binding of wild-type Rev to the RRE and subsequent interactions with the cellular factors that facilitate the cytoplasmic expression of unspliced viral RNA ( 17 ) .
We speculate that subclone 4 displayed only a delay in the onset of acute infection with HTLV-IIIB ( Fig .
1 B ) , because it appears to show increased susceptibility to initial infection , as determined by the CAT infection experiment ( Fig .
2 ) , relative to the other lines .
Importantly , expression of Rev M10 protein did not interfere with the induction of several T cell activation genes , including the NF-KB transcription factor , those required for Tat function , and the multiple regulatory proteins that control IL-2 synthesis .
Although the possibility remains that Rev M10 may affect other activation pathways , these results suggest that stable expression of Rev M10 does not adversely affect T cell function globally .
The Rev M10 protein therefore represents a gene product that might preclude efficient HIV-1 replication without adversely affecting T cell function .
Although differential protection by Rev M10 was observed in separate subclones with the uncloned virus pool , resistance need not be conferred equally on all T cells to provide a therapeutic effect .
For example , T cell clones rendered resistant to HIV-1 could proliferate to reconstitute the immune system of an infected host .
Because multiple cells can be transduced , protection against HIV-1-induced disease might be achieved by transducing sufficiently large numbers of cells with Rev M10 .
This gene could be readily introduced into peripheral CD4* T cells or eventually into progenitor cells that give rise to mature CD4* populations .
This strategy might , therefore , be used to slow the progression of AIDS in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients or , possibly , might be used to restore immune function in individuals that have progressed to later disease stages .
