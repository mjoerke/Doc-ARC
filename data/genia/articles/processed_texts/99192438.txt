HEMATOPOIESIS 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D ; , Induces Differentiation of a Retinoic Acid-Resistant Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Cell Line ( UF-1 ) Associated With Expression Of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 By Akihiro Muto , Masahiro Kizaki , Kenji Yamato , Yohko Kawai , Maiko Kamata-Matsushita , Hironori Ueno , Masahiro Ohguchi , Tatsuji Nishihara , H. Phillip Koeffler , and Yasuo Ikeda Retinoic acid ( RA ) resistance is a serious problem for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) who are receiving all-trans RA .
However , the mechanisms and strategies to overcome RA resistance by APL cells are still unclear .
The biologic effects of RA are mediated by two distinct families of transcriptional factors : RA receptors ( RARs ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) .
RXRs heterodimerize with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ; [ 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ] receptor ( VDR ) , enabling their efficient transcriptional activation .
The cyclin-dependent kinase ( cdk ) inhibitor p214 `` `` ° `` `` has a vitamin D ; -responsive element ( V DRE ) in its promoter , and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; enhances the expression of p21 4 `` and induces differentiation of selected myeloid leukemic cell lines .
We have recently established a novel APL cell line ( UF-1 ) w ith features of RA resistance .

Associated with these findings , the levels of p21 `` 4 `` and p27 `` mRNA and protein increased in these ETINOIC ACID ( RA ) and vitamin D ; , have profound effects on the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells , as well as other cell types .

All-frans RA and its stereoisomer , 9-cis RA , induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of human leukemic cell lines such as HL-60 cells and fresh leukemic cells from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D ; , [ 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ] is a biologic active form of vitamin D ; that functions primarily in calcium homeostasis in vitro .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can also induce some myeloid leukemic cell lines to differentiate along the monocyte/macrophage pathway and can prolong the survival of leukemic mice .
`` * These biologic effects of RA and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; are mediated by their respective nuclear receptors , retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) , retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) , and vitamin D ; receptor ( VDR ) .
They are members of the steroid receptor superfamily and act as ligand-inducible transcription factors by binding to their cognate responsive DNA elements , termed the RA-responsive element ( RARE ) and vitamin D , -responsive element ( VDRE ) .

Northern blot analysis showed that p21 and p27 `` transcripts were induced after 6 hours ' exposure to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and then decreased to basal levels over 48 hours .
Western blot experiments showed that p21 `` 4 `` `` `` `` protein levels increased and became detectable after 12 hours of 1,25 ( OH ) > D ; treatment and induction of p27* `` `` protein was much more gradual and sustained in UF-1 cells .

In contrast , RA alone can induce G1 arrest of UF-1 cells ; however , it did not result in an increase of p21 and p27* `` `` transcript and protein expression in RA-resistant cells .
Taken together , we conclude that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; induces increased expression of cdk inhibitors , which mediates a G1 arrest , and this may be associated with differentiation of RA-resistant UF-1 cells toward mature granulocytes .

2226 treatment with RA relapsed and developed RA-resistant dis-ease . ``
However , the mechanisms and strategies to overcome RA resistance by APL cells are still unclear .
Recently , we established a novel APL cell line ( UF-1 ) with RA-resistant features that can be used as a model for studies on RA resistance in APL cells .
?
In this study , we report that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can overcome RA resistance in this model system of APL .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and chemicals .
- The RA-resistant UF-1 promyelocytic leukemia cell line was established in our laboratory from a patient with APL in relapse who had received all-trans RA . ``
HL-60 and NB4 promyelocytic cells are RA-responsive leukemic cells ( the latter being a gift from Dr M. Lanotte , Hopital St Louis , Paris , France ) . ``
The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium ( GIBCO-BRL ; Grand Island , NY ) with 10 % fetal calf serum ( [ FCS ] Hyclone Laboratories , Logan , UT ) , 100 U/mL penicillin , and 100 mg/mL streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO ; .
All-trans RA was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co ( St Louis , MO ) , and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was a generous gift from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co ( Tokyo , Japan ) .
They were dissolved in 100 % ethanol to a stock concentration of 1 mmol/L , stored at -20°C , and protected from light .
The morphology and cytochemistry of the cells were evaluated from cytospin slide preparations with Giemsa and naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase staining .
Assays for cellular proliferation .
Cellular proliferation was measured by cell viability and a nonradioactive cell proliferation assay system ( MTT assay ; Bochringer-Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
Cells ( 2 X 103 ) were incubated with chemicals for 4 days in 96-well plates ( Flow Laboratories , Irvine , CA ) .
Ten microliters of MTT ( 3- ( 4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-y1 ) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide , 5 ug/mL ) was added to each well .
The reaction was stopped after 4 hours of incubation by adding 100 uL 0.04N HCl in isopropanol , and absorbance at 570 nm was determined .
Control » 1,25 ( OH ) 2Ds3 MUTO ET AL Flow cytometric analysis .
For analysis of cellular differentiation , expression of cell-surface antigens was determined by an immunofluorescence staining technique .
Cells were incubated for 30 minutes with human AB serum ( Sigma ) to block Fc receptors and then stained using fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) -conjugated mouse anti-human CD14 and phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated mouse anti-human CD11b antibodies ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
Control studies were performed with nonbinding control mouse IgG ; and IgG » , isotype antibodies ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Cells were analyzed by a Cytron Absolute Flow Cytometer ( Ortho Diagnostic Systems , Raritan , NJ ) .
Cell cycle analysis .
- Cells ( 1 X 10° ) were suspended in hypotonic solution ( 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 1 mmol/L Tris hydrochloride , pH 8.0 , 3.4 mmol/L sodium citrate , and 0.1 mmol/L EDTA ) and stained with 5 ug/mL propidium iodide .
Analysis was performed immediately after staining using the CELLEIT program ( Becton Dickinson ) .
RNA isolation and Northern blotting .
Total RNA was extracted using the Isogen kit ( Nippon Gene , Tokyo , Japan ) according to the manufacturer 's instruction .
Total RNA ( 15 ug per lane ) was electropho-resed on formaldehyde-agarose gels ( GIBCO-BRL ) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Hybond N* ; Amersham Japan , Tokyo , Japan ) .
The filters were hybridized with P-labeled probe for 24 hours at 42°C in 50 % formamide , 2X SSC ( 1X SSC is 150 mmol/L NaCl plus 15 mmol/L sodium citrate , pH 7.0 ) , 5X Denhardt solution , 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 10 % dextran sulfate , and 100 ug/mL salmon sperm DNA .
Filters were washed to a stringency of 0.1X SSC at 65°C and exposed to Kodak XAR film ( Eastman Kodak , Rochester , NY ) .
Autoradiograms were exposed for 24 hours to 3 days .
Densitometry was performed for signal intensity on autoradiograms of Northern blots using a digital densitometer .
DNA probes .
The plasmid containing human p21 `` * `` `` `` `` cDNA ( Notl-NofI ; 2.1 kb ) was kindly provided by Dr B. Vogelstein ( Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD ) , `` and the human p27** `` `` cDNA was purified from the pBluescript II SK plasmid ( EcoRI-EcoRI , 1.5 kb ; a gift from Dr J.

These probes were labeled with [ a- > 2P ] dCTP using the rediprime DNA labeling system ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
The specific activity was approximately 2 X 10° cpm/ug DNA .
Western blotting .
Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm for 10 minutes , and then the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mmol/L , 40 mmol/L Tris hydrochloride , pH 8.0 , and 150 mmol/L NaC ) ) at 4°C for 15 minutes .
Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay system ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) .
Cell lysates ( 10 ug protein per lane ) were fractionated in 12.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels before transfer to the membrane ( Immobilon-P membranes ; Millipore , Bedford , MA ) by standard proto-col .
The membrane was blocked overnight with 5 % defatted milk in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) at 4°C .
The anti-p21 A `` /CIP !
_p27KIP1 , -p15 `` **2 , and -p16 `` **A antibodies ( Calbiochem , Cambridge , MA ) were used at 1:1,000 dilution in 5 % defatted milk in PBS for 1 hour at 25°C .
Subsequently , membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit Ig conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( 1:3,000 ; Amersham ) for 1 hour at 25°C .
All steps were followed by three washes for 5 minutes in PBS , 1 % defatted milk , and 0.2 % Tween 20 .
Antibody binding was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit for Western blotting detection with hyper-ECL film ( Amersham ) .
Blots were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and confirmed to contain a similar amount of protein extract on each lane .
Plasmid and transfection .
The full-length human p27 `` cDNA plasmid ( pBluescript II SK-hp27 ) was used as the template in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify the human p27 `` cDNA fragment ( codons 2 to 199 ) that was cloned into the Bg/I and BamHI sites of the pBGFP-C1 expression vector ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) , which contains a cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) IE promoter and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) reporter gene .
The resultant plasmid was designated pEGFP-hKIP1 .
The pEGFP-neo was used as a control Table 1 .

RESULTS Morphologic changes induced in RA-resistant APL cells ( UF-1 ) cultured with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; .
UPF-1 cells in control cultures showed large round nuclei and numerous granules in the cytoplasm , as found with hypergranulocytic promyelocytes ( Fig 1A ) .
Incubation with 10~ `` mol/L 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; for 4 days resulted in differentiation of UF-1 cells , as evidenced by nuclear maturation and lobulation , and a diminished number of granules in the cytoplasm ( Fig 1B ) .
Naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase was positive for both control and 1,25 ( OH ) ; Ds-treated UE-1 cells ( Fig 1C and D ) , consistent with these cells being of the granulocytic lineage .
Effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on cellular proliferation of UF-1 cells .
UF-1 cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10- ' to 10- `` mol/L ) with or without all-trans RA ( 10- `` mol/L ) for 4 days ( Fig 2A ) or treated with the indicated agents for different times ( Fig 2B ) .
As previously reported , `` all-trans RA alone did not effect growth of UF-1 cells , as reflected by a lack of change in their absorbance in the MTT assay .
In contrast , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; inhibited the cellular proliferation and decreased the number of viable cells in a dose ( 10- ' `` to 10- `` mol/L ) - and time ( 0 to 96 hours ) -dependent manner .
Interestingly , the combination of 10- `` mol/L all-trans RA and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , markedly inhibited cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner ( Fig 2A and B ) .
We next examined the effect of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , and all-trans RA on cell cycle progression in UF-1 cells .
The cells were incubated with either 10~ ' mol/L all-trans RA , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , or a combination of both for 48 hours and analyzed for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry ( Table 1 ) .
Cultivation with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; for 48 hours increased the population of cells in G1 phase from 80.2 % to 93.3 % with a From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

2228 reduction of cells in S phase from 13.8 % to 5.0 % .
Consistent with the cellular proliferation assay , the combination of all-trans RA and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; significantly increased the number of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle ( 98.4 % ) compared with control cells ( 80.2 % ) , with a concomitant decrease in the S phase ( Table 1 ) .
These increased populations of G1 phase in 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; -treated cells represent G1-arrested cells .
Functional evidence for differentiation of UF-1 cells to granulocytes by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D3 .
- Induction of the differentiation of UF-1 cells to granulocytes by was assessed by the expression of CD11b and CD14 antigens ( Figs 3 and 4 ) .
All-trans RA ( 10~ ' mol/L ) did not alter the expression of CD11b and CD14 antigens by fluorescent-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) analysis compared with control cells .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 107° to 10~ `` mol/L ) induced CD11b positive cells in a dose-dependent manner from 1 % to 66 % .
The combination of various concentrations of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; plus all-trans RA ( 10- `` mol/L ) greatly enhanced the expression of CD11b antigen as compared with either agent alone .
However , expression of CD14 antigen was unchanged after exposure to either Control CD11b CD11b 10° 10° 10 ' ... MUTO ET AL 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; alone or the combination of RA and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( Figs 3 and 4 ) .
These results are consistent with the morphologic and cytochemical studies , suggesting that 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; induces differentiation of UF-1 cells down the granulocytic pathway and RA can enhance this effect .
Expression of p2IY* `` C* `` ' and p27 mRNA in HL-60 , NB4 , and UF-1 cells .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; induced the differentiation of UE-1 cells in association with a block of cell cycle progression at the G1 phase .
Therefore , to address the mechanisms of action of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; on RA-resistant APL cells , we examined the expression of edk inhibitors in UF-1 cells .
1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can induce HL-60 cells to differentiate into monocyte/macrophage-like cells .
Forty-eight hours ' incubation of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10~ `` mol/L ) was sufficient to commit HL-60 cells to differentiate along the monocyte/macrophage pathway ( data not shown ) .
HL-60 cells were cultured for 48 hours in the presence of 10- `` mol/L 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , and then the expression of p21 4 `` !

The related cdk inhibitor p27* `` was also included in this analysis ( Figs 7 and 8A and B ) .
The levels of p21 A** !
and p27 `` transcripts increased about twofold after 6 hours of exposure to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , and then the expression decreased toward baseline levels over the remaining 42 hours ( Figs 6 and 7 ) .
Western blot experiments showed that p21 `` * `` * `` `` `` protein levels became detectable after 6 hours and peaked at 12 hours of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10~ `` mol/L ) treatment .
The level of p27 `` !
protein increased by 3 hours and continued to increase at 72 hours of culture with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 10- `` mol/L ) ( Fig 8A ) .
The dissociation between the early and transient mRNA induction of p27 `` and the late and sustained appearance of the corresponding protein suggests that posttranscriptional regulation is imposed on this edk inhibitor .
All-trans RA combined with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; did not further enhance the expression of mRNA and protein ( Figs 6 and 8B ) .
However , p27** `` `` transcripts and proteins were strongly induced after 6 hours ' exposure to the combination of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , and all-trans RA compared with 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; alone ( Figs 7 and 8B ) .
These findings paralleled the synergistic ability of these two ligands to induce the differentiation of UF-1 cells toward granulocytes .
We also examined the ankyrin family of edk inhibitors that includes and p16'*44 .
However , these INK4 proteins were not detectable by Western blot analysis following 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; treatment ( data not shown ) .
Forced expression of p27 `` induces cellular differentiation of myeloid cells .
- The results of our expression studies suggest an association of p27* `` `` expression and myeloid cell differentiation induced by 1,25 ( OH ) ; Ds ; .
To further explore this associa-tion , we constructed a GFP-p27* `` `` `` fusion protein-expressing plasmid ( pEGFP-hKIP1 ) and a control plasmid ( pEGFP-neo ) and transfected them into myeloid leukemic cells .
The slow-growing promyelocytic NB4 and UF-1 cells were impossible to transfect effectively ; therefore , our experiments focused on HL-60 cells .
This expression vector contains the GFP reporter gene , and thus , the plasmid-introduced cell population was positive for green fluorescence .

This clearly suggests that forced expression of p27 `` can result in cellular differentiation of leukemic cells .
DISCUSSION To date , the mechanisms of RA resistance in APL cells are still unclear , and most approaches have not been successful in overcoming RA resistance in vivo . ``
Cell differentiation is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner ; for example , differentiation of hematopoietic cells is associated with a loss of cell cycling capacity , and the cells become arrested in the GO/G1 phase of the cell cycle .
`` ?
Also , the principal block to cell cycle progression in 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; -treated human cells is known to occur in the G1 phase .
'* > In the present study , we showed that RA-resistant UF-1 cells differentiated toward granulocytes when cultured with 1,25 ( OH ) ; Ds ; , and this was associated with the G1 arrest of these cells and an increased expression of the cdk inhibitors and Consistent with the induction of p21WAF/CZ !
and p27 `` transcripts in UF-1 cells after a short exposure to either 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; or 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; combined with all-trans RA , the inhibition of cellular proliferation occurred within 6 to 12 hours .
These data suggest that an increase of p21 AFC !
and p27 `` transcripts associates with cyclin-edk complexes during the first 12 hours of exposure to 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , and is capable of inhibiting the kinase activities with these complexes , leading to GO/G1 arrest and differentiation of the myeloid leukemic cells .

Many genes are reportedly regulated by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ; however , none of these genes have been shown to be direct targets for VDR regulation .
Recently , Liu et al ' `` reported that the induced differentiation of the myelomonocytic leukemia cell line U937 by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; was facilitated by transcriptional stimulation of the p21W4F/CP !

( B ) Enhanced expression of p27* `` ' protein by exposure of cells to the combination of 10- `` mol/L all-trans RA and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; for 48 hours .
RA alone did not induce differentiation of the cells .
Although all-trans RA alone was able to induce G1 arrest of UF-1 cells ( Table 1 ) , the reason it did not inhibit the cellular growth is unclear .
All-trans RA alone did not upregulate the expression of p21 AR/CHP !
and p27 `` !
in UF-1 cells , and therefore , induction of G1 arrest may be a necessary , but insufficient , condition for cellular differentiation in UF-1 cells .
Cell cycle arrest and activation of edk inhibitors may be important for induction of cellular differentiation .
The mechanisms underlying acquired RA resistance in APL patients have remained elusive .
Recent studies have shown that mutations in the ligand-binding domain of RARa or PML/RARa genes are related to the development of RA resistance in some patients with APL.3 `` :38 Moreover , it has been reported that RA can dissociate the nuclear receptor corepressor/histone deacetylase complex from PML/RAR « , which relieves transcriptional repression and leads to activation of genes involved in the terminal differentiation of APL cells . ``

Cells were transiently transfected with either pEGFP-hKIP1 or pEGFP-neo control plasmid by electroporation .

Expression of CD11b antigen in the GFP-positive fraction was analyzed by two-color flow cytometry .
RARs , a RARE in the promoter region of the gene was required to confer RA-induced cellular differentiation . ``
Taken together , our results suggest that the failure to induce edk inhibitors by the ligand-activated RAR through RARE in the promoter region of their target genes may explain , in part , the RA resistance in UPF-1 cells .
Further studies will be needed to clarify the mechanisms of RA resistance and regulation of cdk inhibitors .
The combination of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; and all-trans RA enhanced p27 `` mRNA and protein in RA-resistant UF-1 cells .
Our group and others have already reported the synergistic differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells by RA and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , which was probably mediated through their cognate nuclear receptors . ``
Also , we previously found that the combination of a novel series of vitamin D ; analogs ( 20-epi vitamin D ; compounds ) and 9-cis RA synergistically decreased proliferation and induced differentiation and apoptosis in APL cells . ``
The mechanism by which RA enhances the effects of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; remains to be clarified .
RA may enhance the transactivation capacity of VDR by receptor heterodimerization of RAR/VDR or RXR/V DR .
This heterodimerization may lead to efficient transactivation of edk inhibitors .
Moreover , the role of the APL-specific PML/RARa « fusion protein in these processes should be explored .
In summary , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; can inhibit growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and induce differentiation of UF-1 RA-resistant APL cells .
These effects are associated with an increased expression of several edk inhibitors .
Furthermore , the combination of RA and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; cooperatively enhances the expression of cdk inhibitors , GO/G1 cell cycle arrest , and differentiation of UF-1 cells .
