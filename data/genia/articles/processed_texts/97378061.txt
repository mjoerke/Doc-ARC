APLs with the PML-RARa « or the PLZF-RARa fusion protein are phenotypically indistinguishable except that they differ in their sensitivity to retinoic acid ( RA ) -induced differentiation : PML-RARa « blasts are sensitive to RA and patients enter disease remission after RA treatment , while patients with PLZF-RARa « do not .
We here report that ( i ) like PML-RARa « expression , PLZEF-RARa « expression blocks terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines ( U937 and HL-60 ) in response to different stimuli ( vitamin D ; , transforming growth factor B1 , and dimethyl sulfoxide ) ; ( ii ) PML-RARa , but not PLZF-RARa , increases RA sensitivity of hematopoietic precursor cells and restores RA sensitivity of RA-resistant hematopoietic cells ; ( iii ) PML-RARa and PLZF-RARa have similar RA binding affinities ; and ( iv ) PML-RARa enhances the RA response of RA target genes ( those for RARRB , RARy , and transglutaminase type II [ TGase ] ) in vivo , while PLZF-RARa « expression has either no effect ( RARf ) or an inhibitory activity ( RARy and type II TGase ) .
These data demonstrate that PML-RARa « and PLZF-RARa « have similar ( inhibitory ) effects on RA-independent differentiation and opposite ( stimulatory or inhibitory ) effects on RA-dependent differentiation and that they behave in vivo as RA-dependent enhancers or inhibitors of RA-responsive genes , respectively .
Their different activities on the RA signalling pathway might underlie the different responses of PML-RARa « and PLZF-RARa « APLs to RA treatment .
The PLZF-RARa « fusion protein contains an approximately 120-amino-acid N-terminal motif ( called the POZ domain ) , which is also found in a variety of zinc finger proteins and a group of poxvirus proteins and which mediates protein-protein interactions .
Deletion of the PLZF POZ domain partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of PLZF-RARa on RA-induced differentiation and on RA-mediated type II TGase up-regulation , suggesting that POZ-mediated protein interactions might be responsible for the inhibitory transcriptional activities of PLZF-RARea .
Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is cytogenetically characterized by a reciprocal translocation that always involves chromosome 17 , with a break within the locus encoding for the retinoic acid receptor « ( RARa ) .
Chromosome partners are chromosome 15 , with the breakpoint located within the PML locus , or , less frequently , chromosome 11 , with the breakpoint within the PLZF locus ( 15 , 51 ) .
The hybrid genes so formed encode a PML-RARa « or PLZF-RARa « fusion protein , which retain equivalent portions of RARa ( 5 , 10 , 22 , 24 , 42 , 43 ) .
The 15 ; 17 and 11 ; 17 translocations are primary chromosome aberrations and are often the only cytogenetic anomalies in the neoplastic metaphases ( 37 ) .
Experimental evidence for leuke-mogenic potential , however , is available only for PML-RARa .
PML-RARa blocks terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines in vitro ( 14 , 16 ) , and , in vivo , mice transgenic for PML-RARa manifest myeloid differentiative alterations with the phenotypic features of promyelocytic leukemia ( 2a , 18 ) .

4859 Despite the fact that PML-RARa and PLZF-RARa APLs are clinically indistinguishable , they differ in one important feature : their response to retinoic acid ( RA ) .
PML-RARa APL blasts are highly sensitive to RA , and most patients treated with RA achieve disease remission ( 9 , 20 , 33 , 50 ) .
In contrast , PLZF-RARa « -expressing APLs are not sensitive to RA treatment ( 13 , 31 ) .
The mechanisms through which PML-RARa « blocks differentiation are not well understood .
The cellular localization of PML-RARa is anomalous with respect to the corresponding wild-type proteins : RARa is nuclear diffuse and PML is localized within specific subnuclear structures called PML nuclear bodies , whereas PML-RARa has a distinct nuclear distribution pattern ( microspeckled localization ) ( 12 , 27 , 52 ) .
It was initially proposed that PML-RARa exerts a dominant-negative action on wild-type PML and RXR , an RARa cofactor ( 26 , 53 , 54 ) , in that expression of PML-RARa « provokes PML and RXR delocalization within microspeckles ( 12 , 27 , 44 , 52 ) .
This hypoth-esis , however , has been recently challenged by the demonstration that delocalization of neither PML nor RXR is critical for the action of PML-RARa « on differentiation ( 17 ) .
Nothing is known about the biological activity or cellular localization of the PLZF-RARa fusion protein .
4860 RUTHARDT ET AL .
The molecular mechanisms of the APL response to RA remain unclear .
Some investigators have suggested that the principal effect of RA is that it releases the dominant-negative effect of PML-RARa on wild-type PML or RXR , thereby removing the inhibitory activity on differentiation of the fusion protein .
This hypothesis is supported by the fact that RA treatment of APL blasts induces progressive disappearance of the PML-RARa microspeckles and the reorganization of PML nuclear bodies and , as a consequence , restores the physiological localization of PML and RXR ( 12 , 27 , 52 ) .
Others instead propose that PML-RARa microspeckles are actively involved in conferring sensitivity to RA and hypothesize that PMLRARa exerts a direct effect on RA signalling in the presence of RA ( 2 , 14 , 15 ) .
The effects of RA on the PLZF-RARa protein are unknown , and the only available data refers to the in vitro transactivating activity of PLZF-RARa on cloned RA target genes , which appears to be indistinguishable from that of PML-RARa ( 6 ) .
We expressed PLZF-RARa in various hematopoietic precursor cell lines and analyzed its effects on terminal differentiation and RA target genes , both in the absence and in the presence of pharmacological doses of RA , and compared the results with those obtained with PML-RARa in the same cell background .
The comparison provided information essential for understanding the mechanisms at the basis of the differentiation block in APL blasts , as well as their response to RA .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of PLZF , PLZF-RARa « , and POZ-PLZEF-RARa « expression vec-tors .
PLZF cDNA clones were isolated from a cDNA library of KG1 myeloid leukemia cells ( Clontech , Palo Alto , Calif. ) by using a DNA probe representative of the human PLZF POZ domain , according to standard screening protocols ( 46 ) .
The PLZF-POZ DNA probe was synthesized from total RNA from KG1 cells by reverse transcription-PCR with the PLZF1 ( 5 AAGCCTCATGCCTGA GCCGA3F ' ) and PLZF2 ( §STACTCGATCTCCAGGATCTC3 ' ) oligonucleo-tides .
Of cight isolated cDNAs , one contained the full-length open reading frame of PLZF ( clone 4B ) .
It was 61 bp longer at the 5 ' end than the reported PLZF B cDNA ( 5 ) .
The PLZF-RARa cDNA was reconstructed by PCR from wild-type PLZF and RARa cDNAs .
Briefly , a PLZF fragment was amplified from position 1446 ( corresponding to the Sacl site ) to position 1522 ( corresponding to the PLZF-RARa crossover junction ) ( 5'TITG GCACCCCGGGAATGAGCCAGTAY ' ) so that a Smel site ( underlined ) was inserted at the 3 ' end of the PLZF fragment .
A similar strategy was used to generate an RARa fragment from the PML junction point ( 5ATCCCCAGCC CGGGTTGAGACCCAGA3 ' ) to the Sect site of RARe ( 5'TTGCGCACCIT CTCAATGAGCTC3 ' ) .
The PLZF-RARa junction was then reconstructed by Smal ligation of the two fragments .
Since the Smal site used to generate the PLZF-RARa « junction introduced a novel amino acid , the appropriate junction was reconstructed by PCR-based mutagenesis ( 5°CGGGTGCGAGCTCGCGG GA3 ' , and 5'TTGCGCACCITTCTCA ATGAGCTC3 ' ) .
The newly generated PLZF-RARa fragment was then ligated to the appropriate RARa sequences to generate a full-length PLZF-RARa cDNA .
To generate the POZ-PLZF-RARa mutant , the POZ domain-encoding sequence ( nucleotides 1 to 471 ) of PLZF-RARa was replaced , by PCR , with a sequence encoding a translational initiation site .
The 5 ' oligonucleotide containing the translational initiation site was 5AGATCCTGGAGATCGCCACCAT GGAGGAACAGTGCCTGA3 ' .
All of the DNA fragments generated by PCR were controlled by DNA sequence .
The PLZF , PLZF-RARa , and POZ-PLZF-RARa cDNAs so obtained were subcloned into the pGMTSVneo Zn-inducible expression vector ( 14 ) and the adenovirus-based PMT2 expression vector ( 17 ) .
The preparation of the hemagglutinin-tagged PML-RARa expression vector has been already described ( 17 ) .
Preparation of anti-PLZF antibodies .
The PLZF open reading frame was cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pGEX-2T after PCR-based creation of an in-frame BamHI site corresponding to the first ATG of PLZF .
Bacterial cultures expressing pGEX vectors were grown in Luria broth containing 50 ug of ampicillin per ml and induced with 1 mM IPTG ( isopropyl-B-o-thiogalactopyr-anoside ) for 3 to 6 h , and the induced bacteria were lysed by sonication in 1 % Triton X-100 .
The glutathione S-transferase-PLZF fusion protein was purified by using glutathione-agarose and eluted with 15 mM glutathione .
Anti-PLZF antibodies were prepared by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with the purified glutathione S-transferase-PLZF fusion protein .
The specificity of the anti-PLZF antibody was tested on COS-1 cells transiently transfected with a PLZF expression vector .

Cell culture , transfection , and Western blotting .
U937 cells , HL60 cells , and the RA-resistant HL60 subclone ( a gift from S. Collins ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
After electropo-ration , the cells were selected in G418 and subcloned under limiting-dilution conditions .
Expression of the exogenous protein was evaluated by Western blotting after 6 to 12 h of induction with 100 wM ZnSQ , , using an anti-RARa « -F ( a gift from P. Chambon ) or the anti-PLZF antibodies , according to established procedures .
Cell differentiation experiments and analysis of cell phenotype .
Experiments involving differentiation of U937 cells under the influence of dihydroxy-vitamin D , ( D3 ) and transforming growth factor B1 ( TGF ) were performed as described previously ( 14 ) .
The percentage of differentiation antigen-positive cells and fluorescence intensity were evaluated by FACScan ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , Calif. ) with appropriate antibodies ( 14 , 17 ) .
RA-induced differentiation was investigated as previously described ( 14 ) .
For HL-60 and HL-60R cells , cells were incubated for 4 days in the presence of 107° M RA , 1.25 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , or 250 ng of D3 per ml .
Granulocytic and monocytic differentiation was evaluated by ( i ) flow cytometry analysis of differentiation-related surface antigens with appropriate antibodies ( see Results ) and ( ii ) light microscopy observation of May-Griinwald-Giemsa-stained samples .
Northern blot analysis and TGase assay .
Total and poly ( A ) * RNA samples ( 10 ug each ) were analyzed by Northern blotting according to established procedures ( 46 ) .
The RARB probe was the Secl/BamHI restriction fragment of the recombinant PSGS RARB vector , the RARy probe was the BemHI restriction fragment of the recombinant PSGS RARy cDNA clone , and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) probe was the Psfl cDNA fragment of the rat GAPDH plasmid .
TGase activity was measured with soluble cell fractions by measuring the incorporation of [ *H } putrescine ( 12.6 Ci/mmol ; Amersham Corp. , Arlington Heights , IIL . )
into casein in triplicate cultures , as previously described ( 2 ) .
RA binding assays .
COS-1 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with a pSGS expression vector for RARa « or PML-RARa or with a pMT2 expression vector for PLZF-RARa .
At 48 to 72 h after transfection , nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared from transfected COS-1 cells as previously described ( 39 ) .
For saturation binding and Scatchard analyses , nuclear extracts were incubated for 18 h at 4°C in the presence of increasing concentrations ( 0.01 to 20 nM ) of °H-labelled all-frans-retinoic acid ( t-RA ) ( 50.7 Ci/mmol ; DuPont/ NEN , Boston , Mass . )
.
Nonspecific binding activity was measured at each time point in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled t-RA .
Specific ligand binding to receptors was separated from free radioactivity by using PD10 desalting columns ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) as described previously ( 21 ) .
Linear least-squares analysis of the Scatchard plot was performed with the aid of the computer program BDATA-EMF .
RESULTS Expression of PLZF-RARa blocks monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of U937 and HL-60 precursor cell lines induced by D3-TGF or DMSO .
To test whether PLZF-RARa blocks terminal differentiation in vitro , the PLZF-RARa cDNA was expressed in the HL-60 and U937 hematopoietic precursor cell lines , and their potential to undergo terminal differentiation was analyzed .
The promonocytic U937 cells proceed towards terminal differentiation under the influence of 250 ng of D3 per ml and 1 ng of TGF per ml ( 48 ) .
The myeloblastic HL-60 cells differentiate towards the granulocytic line when induced with DMSO and towards the monocytic line when stimulated with the combination of D3 and TGF ( 7 , 48 ) .
The PLZF-RARa cDNA under the control of the Zn-inducible MT-1 promoter was electroporated into U937 and HL-60 cells .
After G418 selection and limiting dilution , 8 of 15 U937 clones and 5 of 12 HL-60 clones were positive for PLZF-RARa expression by Western blotting analysis with anti-PLZF ( see Materials and Methods ) or anti-RARa antibodies .
Two clones of each cell type were selected for further analysis by two criteria : ( i ) increased protein expression upon Zn treatment ( Fig .
1A ) and ( ii ) capacity to undergo terminal differentiation in the absence of Zn ( not shown ) .
All of the U937 clones that were analyzed revealed a slight PLZF-RARa expression in the absence of Zn induction ( Fig .
1A ) ; however , this level of Zn-independent fusion protein expression did not interfere significantly with differentiation induced by D3-TGF ( not shown ) .
Clones transfected with the empty expression vector were used as controls .

Differentiation levels induced by D3-TGF ( A ) or RA ( B and C ) in U937 cells transduced with the MT vector ( control B41 clone ) or overexpressing PLZF-RARa ( B412 clone ) , PML-RARa ( PR9 clone ) , or POZ-PLZF-RARa ( B49 clone ) proteins .
( A ) D3-TGF-induced differentiation was measured by quantitative expression of CD11a , CD11b , CD14 , and CD18 antigens and by the percentages of cells with phagocytic activity and capacity to bind LPS in the absence and in the presence of Zn treatment .
The results obtained after zinc-induced expression of the exogenous proteins are expressed as percentages of the values obtained in the absence of zinc .
Three experiments for each clone were performed , and standard deviations are given .
( B and C ) RA-induced differentiation was measured by the NBT reduction test .
Each experiment is representative of three that gave similar results .
Terminal differentiation was induced by 4 days of treatment with D3-TGF ( U937 and HL-60 cells ) or DMSO ( HL-60 cells ) in the presence or absence of Zn and monitored by quantitative fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of appropriate surface differentiation antigens ( CD11a , CD11b , CD14 , CD18 , phagocytic activity , and lipopolysaccharide [ LPS ] binding in U937 cells treated with D3-TGF ; CD11a , CD11b , CD14 , CD18 , and CD54 in HL60 cells treated with D3-TGF ; and CD11a , CD11b , and CD18 in HL60 cells treated with DMSO ) .
Expression of all of these markers was low or absent in the unstimulated parental cell lines or in the non-Zn-treated clones and increased progressively during differentiation ( not shown ) , as previously reported ( 14 , 17 , 48 ) .
To avoid biases of clonality and culture condition variations , differentiation was evaluated for each clone in both the presence and absence of Zn-induced protein expression .
Results are given as the percentage of differentiation marker expression in the presence of Zn with respect to expression in its absence .
The differentiation-related increase in differentiation marker expression was not affected by Zn treatment in either HL-60 or U937 cells ( Fig .
2A , control ) .
The effects of PLZF-RARa on the monocytic differentiation of U937 cells induced by D3-TGF are reported in Fig .
2A .
Both the B45 and B412 PLZF-RARa-expressing clones differentiated poorly in response to D3-TGF after Zn-induced PLZF-RARa expression .
The differentiative block mediated by PLZF-RARa was equal ( CD14 antigen , phagocytic activity , and LPS binding ) or superior ( CD11a , CD11b , and CD18 antigens ) to that obtained by expressing PML-RARa in the same cells ( Fig .
2A , clone PR9 ) .
The effects of PLZF-RARa « expression on D3-TGF-induced monocytic and DMSO-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells are shown in Fig .

Zn-induced PLZF-RARa expression impaired the capacity of the B28 and B211 clones to undergo D3-TGF- or DMSO-induced differentiation , as revealed by differentiation antigen analysis .

blast-like morphology in the presence of Zn-induced PLZF-RARa expression , while they acquired typical monocytic or granulocytic features , respectively , in the absence of Zn ( data not shown ) .
The capacity of PLZF-RARa « to block terminal differentiation of HL-60 cells could not be compared with that of PML-RARa because HL-60 cells are not permissive for PML-RARa expression ( 14 ) .
These results indicate that PLZF-RARa expression blocks monocytic and granulocytic terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cell lines and suggest that this biological activity of PLZF-RARa , as in the case of PML-RAR « , contributes to its in vivo leukemogenetic potential .
PLZF-RARa and PML-RARa « have different effects on the RA-induced monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of U937 and HL-60 cells .
We have previously demonstrated that expression of PML-RARa « increases the sensitivity of U937 cells to the differentiative action of RA ( 14 ) .
The effect of PLZF-RARa on RA-induced differentiation was therefore investigated by analyzing the RA responses of U937 and HL-60 cells expressing PLZF-RARa .
U937 cells differentiate poorly in response to RA , as determined by the percentage of differentiated cells ( between 20 and 50 % ) and the degree of differentiation ( no modulation of the conventional differentiation antigens ) ( 40 ) .
RA-induced differentiation of U937 cells is usually monitored by measuring the capacity of differentiated cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium ( NBT ) .
The B41 control clone differentiated poorly after 6 days of RA treatment , and differentiation was not affected by Zn treatment ( 15 and 22 % NBT-positive cells with and without Zn , respectively ) ( Fig .
2B ) .
In the PML-RARa-transduced cells ( PR9 clone ) , RA induced a comparable low degree of differentiation when cells were grown in the absence of Zn ( 20 % NBT -positive cells ) , while differentiation was almost complete ( approximately 90 % NBT positivity ) when the same cells were induced by RA in the presence of Zn .
The response to RA was , instead , modest in the B412 PLZF-RARa-transfected clone in both the presence and absence of Zn-induced PLZF-RARa expression ( 15 and 23 % NBT -positive cells , respectively ) ( Fig .
2B ) .
Comparable results were obtained by using another PLZF-RARa U937 clone ( clone B45 ; data not shown ) .
Granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells by RA can be monitored by analyzing surface differentiation antigens ( CD11a , CD11b , and CD18 ) or by morphological evaluation .
PLZF-RARa expression blocked RA-induced differentiation , as evaluated by either of these criteria ( see Fig .
3 for surface marker analysis ; morphology not shown ) .
In summary , it appears that PLZF-RARa « expression blocks RA-induced differentiation .
The effect seems to differ from that of PML-RARa , which , at least in the U937 cells , increases the RA response .
These data suggest that PML-RARa « and PLZF-RARa exert different effects on the RA signalling pathway .
Direct proof for this proposal was searched for by testing the capacities of PML-RARa « and PLZF-RARa to restore sensitivity to RA in RA-resistant hematopoietic cells .
PML-RARa , but not PLZF-RARa , restores the sensitivity to RA of an RA-resistant HL-60 subline .
HL-60R is an HL-60 subline selected for its ability to grow in the presence of RA ( 8 ) .

Results are expressed as percentages of positive cells after RA treatment in the presence of Zn induction .
Three experiments for each clone were performed , and standard deviations are given .

Rein-troduction of wild-type RARa in these cells restores sensitivity to RA ( 8 ) .
PML-RAR « a , PLZF-RAR « , and RARa ( as a con-trol ) cDNAs were transfected into HL-60R cells by using the pGMTSVneo expression vector .
Two clones that expressed high levels of exogenous protein expression after Zn induction were selected from each transfection ( see Fig .
1B for PLZF-RARa and PML-RARa « protein expression results ) .
Two clones transfected with the empty expression vector were used as controls ( clones 41 and 42 ) .
It should be noted that HL-6O0R cells , like the parental HL-60 cells , are not permissive for PML-RARa « expression ( 14 ) and that we obtained HL-60R ( but not HL-60 ) PML-RARa-expressing clones by the concomitant expression of bel-2 .
The mechanism ( s ) by which bel2 makes HL-60R cells permissive for PML-RARa expression will be reported elsewhere .
Parallel control experiments revealed that bel2 expression does not interfere with the RA sensitivity of HL-60R cells ( not shown ) .
RA treatment of HL-60R control clones neither modified their growth potential ( not shown ) nor induced differentiation , as determined by surface marker analysis ( Fig .
4 , HL-6O0R clones 41 and 42 ) and morphological analysis ( not shown ) .
RARa expression restored RA sensitivity of HL-6OR cells , as demonstrated by the facts that cells stopped growing ( not shown ) and acquired the ability to fully express differentiation markers ( Fig .
4 , clones 7 and 10 ) and the morphological features of differentiated cells ( not shown ) when treated with RA .
Likewise , expression of PML-RARa largely restored RA sensitivity of HL-60R cells ( Fig .
4 , clones 12.1 and 13.1 ) , whereas PLZF-RARa « did not , except for a mild stimulatory effect on CD18 expression ( Fig .
4 , clones 34 and 43 ) .
PML-RARa and PLZF-RARa « have similar RA binding affinities and opposite effects on RA target genes in vivo .
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the opposite effects of PML-RARa and PLZF-RARa on RA-mediated differentiation , we evaluated their capacities to bind RA and to activate RA target genes in vivo .
Nuclear extracts from either COS-1 cells transiently transfected with PLZF-RARa « or U937 B45 clone stably expressing PLZF-RARa were labelled for 18 h with increasing concentrations of [ °HJt-RA and analyzed by using PD10 desalting columns ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The binding affinity of t-RA to PLZF-RARa was analyzed directly by saturation ki-netics and Scatchard analysis and compared to those for PMLRARa and RARa ( 39 ) .
The t-RA binding to PLZF-RARa was specific and saturable ( not shown ) .
Scatchard analysis of this binding indicated a single high-affinity binding site on PLZF-RARa expressed by either COS-1 or U937 cells ( not shown ) .
The calculated dissociation constants were 0.17 and 0.19 nM , respectively , and were similar to those determined for RARa and PML-RARa ( Table 1 ) .
U937 cells expressing PML-RARa or PLZF-RARa « were then analyzed for the effects of RA on four RA target genes ( those for RARB , RARy , CRABP1 , and CRABP2 ) ( 25 , 35 , 38 , 47 ) and on the type II TGase gene , a gene that is regulated by Vor .

retinoids and was recently shown to be a marker of RA-induced differentiation in APL cells ( 2 ) .
Type II TGase was assessed by measuring cytosolic TGase activity in U937 control cells ( clone B41 ) and in PML-RARa ( clone PR9 ) - and PLZF-RARa ( clone B412 ) -expressing cells before RA treatment and after 24 and 48 h in the presence or absence of RA ( Fig .
5A ) .
A two- to threefold increase of TGase activity was observed in B41 control cells after 48 h of RA treatment , irrespective of Zn treatment .
In PR9 cells induced to express PML-RARa , TGase activity was strongly up-regulated after 24 and 48 h of RA treatment ( 5- to 10-fold increase over that in non-Zn-induced cells ) .
In contrast , in PLZF-RARa-expressing cells there was no induction after 24 h and a slight down-regulation of TGase activity after 48 h of RA treatment ( Fig .
5A ) .
RARy expression was evaluated by Northern blot analysis of poly ( A ) `` mRNA from U937 control cells ( clone B41 ) or cells expressing PML-RARa ( clone PR9 ) or PLZF-RARa « ( clone B412 ) , with the full-length RARy cDNA as a probe .
The results revealed a slight up-regulation of the RARy transcript in the control B41 cells after 24 h of RA treatment and disappearance of the signal after 48 h. Instead , a strong induction of RARy expression was detected in PML-RARa-expressing cells after 24 h , with a decline in the hybridization signal after 48 h. There was no , or very little , RARy expression in PLZF-RARa-expressing cells after either 24 or 48 h ( Fig .
5B ) .
The approximately 3.5-kb RARy-hybridizing transcript in the RNA samples from PLZF-RARa-expressing cells derives from the cross-hybridization of the RARy probe with the PLZF-RARa transcript , as demonstrated by the hybridization of the same blot with an RARa cDNA probe ( data not shown ) .
Total RNA from the same U937 clones was also analyzed for RARBG expression ( Fig .
5C ) .
Since we have noted a great variability in the degree of RARB expression after RA treatment of different U937 clones ( not shown ) , to avoid biases from clonal variability , the RARf response to RA was compared for the same clones in the presence or absence of Zn induction .
Expression of PML-RARa resulted in increased accumulation of RARL transcripts after 24 h of RA treatment , as compared to that in non-Zn-treated cells , while PLZF-RARa expression did not affect RARBG expression at the same time point after RA treatment ( Fig .
5C ) .
CRABP1 and CRABP2 genes were not detected in U937 cells under any culture condition ( data not shown ) .
It appears that , in vivo , PML-RARa « potentiates the RA response of TGase and the two tested RA target genes ( RARB and RARy ) , while PLZF-RARa « either exerts no effect on ( RARB ) or inhibits ( TGase and RARy ) RA target gene activation .
Deletion of the POZ domain partially releases the inhibitory effect of PLZF-RARa on RA signalling .
The PLZF-RARa fusion protein retains the POZ domain of PLZF ( 5 ) .
The POZ EFFECTS OF PML-RARe AND PLZF-RARa « ON RA DIFFERENTIATION - 4865 domain is a 120-amino-acid conserved motif present in a large family of proteins that includes a variety of zinc finger proteins and a group of poxvirus proteins ( 1 ) .
The POZ domains from the zinc finger proteins ZID , Ttk , and GAGA have been shown to function as protein interaction domains and to inhibit the interaction of their associated DNA binding regions with DNA ( 1 ) .
To preliminarily investigate the mechanism ( s ) through which the fusion of PLZF with RARa « results in a protein with inhibitory activity on the RA-dependent signalling pathway , we analyzed the effects of the deletion of the POZ domain on the capacity of PLZF-RARa to block RA differentiation and to repress RA target genes in vivo .
A PLZF-RARa mutant with a deletion of the region encoding the PLZF POZ domain ( POZ-PLZF-RARa ; see Materials and Methods ) was cloned under the control of the Zn-inducible MT-1 promoter and electroporated into U937 and HL-60R cells .
Expression of the POZ-PLZF-RARa polypeptide was analyzed in individual clones by Western blotting with anti-PLZF antibodies .
Two clones each of U937 ( B49 and B411 ) and HL6OR ( B35 and B47 ) cells were chosen for further analysis based on their levels of exogenous protein expression ( Fig .
1C ) .
Immunofluorescence analysis with anti-PLZF antibodies revealed that the POZ-PLZF-RARa polypeptide had the same microsplecked localization as PLZF-RARa « ( data not shown ) .
We then compared the capacities of U937 and HLGOR cells expressing POZ-PLZF-RAR « , PLZF-RARa , or PML-RARa to differentiate in the presence of RA .
In the absence of Zn treatment , RA induced a similarly low degree of differentiation ( 10 to 20 % NBT -positive cells ) of U937 cells expressing POZ-PLZF-RARa , PLZF-RARa , or PML-RARa .
However , upon Zn induction of exogenous protein expression , RA-induced differentiation increased to approximately 40 to 50 % in the POZ-PLZF-RARa U937 cells , a level which was intermediate between those of PLZF-RARa « ( approximately 20 % ) and PML-RARa « ( approximately 90 % ) cells ( Fig .
2C ) .
Similar results were obtained with HL6OR cells : RA treatment of POZ-PLZF-RARa-expressing HL6OR cells induced partial up-regulation of the CD11a , CD11b , and CD18 differentiation antigens ( Fig .
4 ) .
U937 cells expressing POZ-PLZF-RARa were then analyzed for the effects of RA on TGase and RARy .
In PR9 cells induced to express POZ-PLZF-RARa , TGase activity was up-regulated after 24 and 48 h of RA treatment ( three- to fourfold increase over that in non-Zn-induced cells ) ( Fig .
5A ) .
In contrast , there was no , or very little , RARy expression in POZ-PLZF-RARa-expressing cells after either 24 or 48 h of RA treatment ( Fig .
5B ) .
In summary , the analysis of the sensitivity of U937 and HL6GOR cells expressing POZ-PLZF-RARa to the differentiative action of RA revealed that the POZ-PLZF-RARa mutant is able to mediate RA sensitivity , although to a lesser extent than PML-RARa , therefore suggesting that the deletion of the POZ domain partially releases the inhibitory effect of PLZF-RARa .
However , analysis of the capacity of the POZ-PLZF-RARa protein to activate RA target genes in vivo yielded heterogeneous results : this protein potentiated the RA response of TGases , while it exerted no effect on RARy gene activation .
DISCUSSION PML-RARa and PLZF-RARa are the abnormal protein products of APLs with either t ( 15 ; 17 ) or t ( 11 ; 17 ) .
These two APL types are phenotypically indistinguishable , from the point of view of both the morphology of the leukemic blasts and the 4866 RUTHARDT ET AL .

RA-induced modulation of type II TGase activity and RARy and RARB expression in control U937 cells ( B41 clone ) and U937 cells expressing PLZF-RARa ( B412 clone ) , POZ-PLZF-RARa ( B49 clone ) , or PML-RARa ( PR9 clone ) .

clinical presentation of the disease .
Therapeutically , however , they differ in that the type that expresses PML-RARa « responds to RA treatment , whereas the type that expresses PLZF-RARa does not ( 15 , 50 , 51 ) .
In the absence of pharmacological doses of RA , the biolog- ical activity of PLZF-RARa on the terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursors is similar to that of PML-RARa .
PLZF-RARa blocks D3-induced monocytic differentiation to the same extent as PML-RARa .
PLZF-RARa was also demonstrated to block DMSO -stimulated granulocytic differentia- Vor .
17 , 1997 tion in the myeloblastic HL-60 cell line .
We have recently found that PLZF-RARa blocks the granulocyte colony-stimu-lating factor-induced granulocytic-erythroid differentiation of the multipotent 32-D cell line ( unpublished results ) .
No such information is available for the PML-RARa fusion protein , as its expression induces death of HL-60 , 32-D , and other precursor cell lines ( 11a ) .
It therefore appears that PLZF-RARa is able to block multilineage myeloid differentiation triggered by different agents ( D3-TGF , DMSO , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ) with seemingly different mechanisms of ac-tion .
When the effects of the two fusion proteins on the RA differentiative response are examined , PLZF-RARa « and PML-RARa are found to behave differently .
We have previously shown that PML-RARa enhances the RA response of cells that respond poorly to RA ( U937 cells ) ( 14 ) .
We now extend this observation to RA-resistant cells and show that PML-RARa is also able to confer sensitivity to RA to these cells .
In contrast , PLZF-RARa « is not able to do so in RA-resistant cells , and it inhibits the RA response of both poorly ( U937 ) and highly ( HL-60 ) responsive cells .
The sensitivity of promyelocytic blasts to the action of RA therefore seems to strictly depend on the type of fusion protein present .
Even though the biological effects of PML-RARa and PLZF-RARa on the cell response to RA are different , at the molecular level both fusion proteins retain the same portion of RARa , from the B to the F domain ( 5 , 43 ) .
A convincing hypothesis would be that the response of promyelocytic blasts to the action of RA is the direct consequence of PML-RARa or PLZF-RARa « activity on the RA signalling pathway .
Our data are consistent with the proposal that pharmacological doses of RA induce PML-RARa , but not PLZF-RARa , to act as an activator on RA-responsive genes .
We studied the response to RA of three RA target genes ( those for TGase , RARf , and RARy ) in U937 cells in the presence and absence of PML-RARa or PLZF-RARa and found that the response was enhanced by PML-RARa but was unaffected or repressed by PLZF-RARa .
It is somewhat surprising that PLZF-RARa and PML-RARa regulate RA target genes differently in vivo , seeing that PML-RARa « and PLZF-RARa have been demonstrated to have analogous transactivating properties on cloned RA-responsive reporter genes in transient-transfection experiments ( 6 ) .
Different regulation of cloned and native promoters might explain this discrepancy .
The mechanism through which the PML-RARa « fusion results in a protein with high RA-dependent enhancer activity on RA target genes in vivo , while the PLZF-RARa « fusion does not , remains unclear .
The distinct transcriptional properties of the fusion proteins might derive from their different abilities to bind DNA , RA , or a variety of nuclear factors that physiolog-ically form complexes with RARs ( RXRs , corepressors , and co-activators ) ( 36 ) .
RARs are ligand-dependent transcription factors that activate transcription through specific DNA binding sites ( RA-responsive elements [ RAREs ] ) in their target genes .
RARs bind RA target gene promoters in physical association with RXRs , a family of retinoid receptors which act as cofactors for several other nuclear receptors ( 3 , 34 ) .
In the absence of RA , corepressors are associated with the RAR-RXR heterodimer , thus determining transcriptional repression ( 4 , 19 , 28 ) .
RA : RAR-RXR interaction induces the dissociation of the corepressors and the recruitment of coactivators , resulting in a transcriptionally active complex ( 23 , 29 , 30 , 41 , 49 ) .
Both PML-RARa and PLZF-RARa retain most of the RARa protein and thus the potential to bind DNA , RA , and the various RAR-RXR cofactors .
Indeed , both fusion proteins are able to bind to RAREs , to transactivate RA target genes in EFFECTS OF AND PLZF-RAR « ON RA DIFFERENTIATION _ 4867 vitro ( data not shown and references 10 , 22 , 24 , 32 , and 42 ) , and to bind RXRs ( 11 , 32 , 44 ) and RA ( 39 ) .
The binding of PLZF-RARa to distinct RAREs is slightly different from that of PML-RARa , thereby suggesting that the two fusion proteins may have different target gene specificities ( 11 ) .
The capacity of PML-RARa and PLZF-RARa « to bind to RAR-RXR coactivators and corepressors has yet to be defined .
However , since these interactions were mapped to RARa regions which are retained within both fusion proteins ( the RAR hinge region and AF-2 domain , respectively ) , they are unlikely to account for the differences between PML-RARa « and PLZF-RARa .
Alternative explanations can be envisioned .
The different regulation of RA target genes by PML-RARa « and PLZF-RARa might result from differential recruitment of nuclear factors through the PML or PLZF moiety of the fusion protein .
They both contain unique protein-protein dimerization interfaces : the PML coiled-coil region , which contains four clusters of heptad repeats with hydrophobic amino acids at the first , fourth , and eighth positions ( 15 ) , and the PLZF POZ domain , an approximately 120-amino-acid motif which characterizes a subfamily of C2-H2 zinc finger proteins ( 11 ) .
The coiled-coil region and the POZ domain are involved in the formation of PML-RARa ( 39 ) and PLZF-RARa ( our unpublished results ) high-molecular-weight nuclear complexes , respectively , and their integrity is crucial for the biological activity of both fusion proteins .
Deletion of the PML coiled-coil region abrogates the capacity of PML-RARa « to block D3-induced differentiation and to increase RA sensitivity ( 17 ) , while deletion of the POZ domain partially releases the inhibitory effect of PLZF-RARa on the RA-induced differentiation and RA-mediated activation of TGase .
While the proteins that interact with the PML coiled-coil region and PLZF POZ domain are not entirely known , each of the two domains is capable of forming homo-oligomers .
The PML coiled-coil region is involved in the formation of PML-RARa homodimers and PML-RARa-PML heterodimers ( 24 , 44 ) , whereas the PLZF POZ domain is involved in the formation of PLZF-RARa homodimers and PLZF-RARo-PLZF heterodimers ( 11 ) .
Of note , we have recently identified PML-RARa mutants that retain the capacity to form PML-RARa homodimers but have lost the ability to form heterodimers with PML ( 17 ) .
Functional analysis of these mutants in U937 cells revealed that the competence to increase RA sensitivity correlates with that of forming PML-RARa « homodimers ( 17 ) .
Thus , the PMLRARa homodimers might have a more potent RA-dependent enhancer function than , in myeloid cells , the physiological RARa-RXR heterodimer ( 26 , 53 , 54 ) .
The inhibitory activity of PLZF-RARa on RA target genes might instead be due , in part , to its interaction with POZ-binding proteins with the ability to silence transcription .
The identification of POZ-binding proteins that interact with PLZF and PLZF-RARa might help in clarifying this issue .
In conclusion , we demonstrated that PML-RARa « and PLZF-RARa have similar inhibitory effects on terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells in the absence of RA , while they have opposite effects on RA differentiation and regulation of RA target genes in the presence of pharmacological doses of RA .
These results might explain why PLZF-RARa and PML-RARa leukemias have identical phenotypes but opposite sensitivities to RA treatment .
