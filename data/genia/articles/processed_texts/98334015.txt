6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; Isolation and Analysis of a T Cell Clone Variant Exhibiting Constitutively Phosphorylated Ser'* > cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein Stanley M. Belkowski , * Charles S. Rubin , ' and Michael B. Prystowsky** In driving T cell proliferation , IL-2 stimulates a new program of gene expression that includes proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , a requisite processivity factor for DNA polymerase 6 .
PCNA transcription is regulated in part through tandem CRE sequences in the promoter and CRE binding proteins ; IL-2 stimulates CREB phosphorylation in the resting cloned T lymphocyte , L2 .
After culturing L2 cells for greater than 91 days , we consistently isolate a stable variant that exhibits constitutive CREB phosphorylation .
L2 and L2 variant cells were tested for IL-2 responsiveness and rapamycin sensitivity with respect to specific kinase activity , PCNA expression and proliferation .
In L2 cells , IL-2 stimulated and rapamycin inhibited the following : cAMP-independent CREB kinase activity , PCNA expression and proliferation .
In L2 variant cells , CREB kinase activity was constitutively high ; IL-2 stimulated and rapamycin blocked PCNA expression and proliferation .
These results indicate that IL-2 induces a rapamycin-sensitive , cAMP-independent CREB kinase activity in L2 cells .
However , phosphorylation of CREB alone is not sufficient to drive PCNA expression and L2 cell proliferation in the absence of IL-2 .
- The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 161 : 659-665. he macrolide rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressant that inhibits cytokine-dependent T cell proliferation ( 1 ) .
Rapamycin exerts its antiproliferative effect by binding to intracellular receptors generating complexes that inhibit progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle in IL-2-stimulated T-lymphocytes ( 2 , 3 ) .
Inhibition of IL-2-induced proliferation by rapamycin is associated with a selective inhibition of protein syn-thesis , including proliferating cell nuclear Ag ( PCNA ) ( 4 , 5 ) .
PCNA is an auxiliary protein for DNA polymerase delta ( 6-10 ) .
The ability of PCNA-specific Abs to inhibit inducible DNA synthesis in isolated nuclei ( 11 ) and of PCNA antisense oligonucle-otides to inhibit proliferation of BALB/c 3T3 cells ( 12 ) documents the role of this protein in DNA replication .
PCNA transcription is increased in IL-2-stimulated T cells ( 13 ) .
The 5 ' regulatory region of the PCNA gene contains tandem cAMP response elements ( CREs ) and an E2F-like site that are critical for IL-2 induction and optimal transcriptional activity ( 14 , 15 ) .
These CRE elements bind CREB and ATF1 .
Furthermore , IL-2 stimulates CREB and ATF1 phosphorylation in T cells during G1 activation ; the ability of these transcription factors to bind to CRE elements in the promoter as Departments of *Pathology and *Pharmacology , Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx , NY 10461 Received for publication December 8 , 1997 .

CREs located in the control region of genes are recognized by several proteins that are members of the activating transcription factor subfamily , including CREB , ATF1 , and others ( 17-20 ) .
The best studied CRE-binding protein is a ~40-kDa protein termed CREB ( 17 , 20 ) .
CREB transcriptional activity is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser'* `` by cAMP-dependent kinase A ( PKA ) ( 21-24 ) .
Other kinases , including Ca `` * /calmodulin dependent kinases ( CAMK ) ( 25 ) , a Ras-dependent kinase ( 26 ) , p90®°* ( 27 ) , ( 28 ) , and RSK2 ( 29 ) have been shown to phosphorylate CREB at Ser'* ?
in response to neurotrophic factors and Ca** fluxes ( 25 , 26 ) .
Phosphorylation of CREB by PKA or cAMP-independent kinases is required for transcriptional activation ( 30-33 ) .
Although cAMP has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of many genes through CREs ( 34 ) , increased levels of cAMP inhibit T cell proliferation ( 35 ) , and IL-2 does not increase cellular levels of cAMP ( 16 ) , suggesting that a kinase other than PKA is responsible for CREB activation in IL-2-stimulated T lymphocytes .
In this report we compare L2 cells with newly evolved L2 variant cells that exhibit constitutive Ser'* > CREB phosphorylation .
In parental L2 cells , IL-2 induces an increase in the levels of PKA , in the activity of a cAMP-independent CREB kinase and in an increase in CREB phosphorylation , all of which are inhibited by rapamycin .
In L2 cells , we conclude that IL-2 regulates CREB phosphorylation through a cAMP-independent , rapamycin-sensitive kinase .
In L2 variant cells , 1 ) basal levels of PKA , CREB kinase activity , and phosphorylated CREB are high and 2 ) PKA levels , CREB kinase activity , and CREB phosphorylation are not affected by IL-2 or rapamycin .
In both L2 and L2 variant cells , rapamycin inhibits IL-2-stimulated PCNA expression and cellular proliferation .
We conclude that Ser'** CREB phosphorylation and CREB kinase activity are not sufficient to drive PCNA expression and T cell proliferation and that rapamycin does not exert 0022-1767/98/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; 660 PKA AND CREB KINASE ACTIVITY IN IL-2-STIMULATED T CELLS 2nd Antibody Alone Untreated 81¥94 - NuV - luV FIGURE 1 .
IL-2-stimulated CREB phosphorylation in L2 cells .
L2 cells were rested in IL-2-free medium for 24 h and then stimulated for 24 h with 100 units of IL-2 or 100 units of IL-2 with rapamycin ( 20 ng/ml ) .
L2 cells were labeled for phosphorylated CREB ( PCREB ) and total CREB using specific polyclonal Abs and a second Ab ( HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit ) as described in Materials and Methods .
As a negative control , cells were labeled with only the donkey anti-rabbit Ab to detect nonspecific secondary Ab binding .
its inhibitory effect on PCNA expression primarily through inhibition of CREB activation .
Materials and Methods Cell culture The murine T helper lymphocyte clone , L2 , was cultured with irradiated allogeneic spleen cells and 30 U/ml of IL-2 ( 36 ) .
Cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and incubated overnight in IL-2-free medium .
Resting T cells ( 1 X 10 % /ml ) were stimulated with 100 U/ml of IL-2 or 100 U/ml IL-2 plus rapamycin ( 20 ng/ml ) ( Research Biochemicals International , Natick , MA ) for 24 h. Highly purified human re-combinant IL-2 from Escherichia coli ( 37 , 38 ) was a gift of Chiron ( Em-eryville , CA ) .
During the last 2 years , L2 cells spontaneously converted to the variant phenotype ( increased basal levels of PKA protein and CREB kinase activity ) five times .
Once the cells have undergone the transition to the variant phenotype , they have not reverted to the parental phenotype .
Also , the variant state , having constitutively high phospho-CREB , is maintained with storage in liquid nitrogen .
L2 variants were studied as a het-erogenous population .
Kinase analysis Cell lysates were processed by the method of Schwartz et al .
( 39 ) .
Briefly , cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in PBS .
The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 10 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7.5 , containing 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM 2-ME , 0.1 PMSF , and 200 nM methyl isobutyl xanthene ) at 0°C .
After 2 min , magnesium acetate was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM .
The cells were disrupted by passage through a 26-gauge needle .
The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 X g for 15 min at 4°C .
The supernatant was collected and stored at -80°C until further analysis .
Lysates were analyzed by the method of Roskowski ( 40 ) .
Lysates were added to the protein kinase reaction mixture : 50 mM MOPS , pH 7.0 , 10 mM magnesium chloride , 0.25 mg/ml BSA , 100 M acceptor peptide , kemptide ( LRRASLG ) ( Bachem , King of Prussia , PA ) ( 41 ) or crebtide ( SRRPSYRK ) , 100 uM [ y- > P ] ATP , and , when indicated , 10 uM cAMP , 5 uM PKI , a PKA specific inhibitor ( 42 ) , and/or 20 ng/ml rapamycin .
To terminate the reaction , 25 pl of sample was spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose discs ( Maidstone , U.K. ) and immersed in 75 mM phosphoric acid for 2 min .
The discs were washed twice more in phosphoric acid .
To determine the total amount of phosphate available for transfer , 25 ul from a sample without kinase was spotted onto a phosphocellulose disc and left unwashed .
The discs were placed in scintillation mixture , and the amount of radioactivity was assessed using a Wallac 1410 scintillation counter .
The dose dependence of protein lysate on kinase activity was measured for kemptide and crebtide at 1 to 13 pug of protein lysate at a constant reaction time of 10 min at room temperature .
These reactions yielded a sigmoid curve for each substrate with 2 to 10 ug of protein lysate defining the linear portion of the curve .
The assays were also performed with a constant amount of protein ( 2.5 ug ) for reaction times of 2 to 15 min .
These reactions yielded a linear curve for each substrate .
Based on this information , the experiments shown in this paper were performed using 2.5 to 5.0 ug of protein for 10 min .
Immunostaining Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS .
Cells for immunostaining were prepared by cytocentrifugation of 50,000 cells per slide and by fixation with 4 % paraformaldehyde .
The slides were incubated with 0.2 % Triton X-100 for 15 min to permeabilize the cells , were blocked with normal goat serum for 20 min , and incubated with rabbit anti-P-CREB ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) ( 1:500 ) or rabbit anti-CREB-1 Ab ( Santa Cruz , Santa Cruz , CA ) ( 1:500 ) overnight at 4°C .
After washing , the slides were incubated sequentially with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Ab ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) ( 1:400 ) , with ABC peroxidase reagent ( Pierce ) for 30 min , and with 3,3'-diaminobenzine tetrahydrochlo-ride ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) as a peroxidase substrate that forms an insoluble reaction product .
Positive staining was visualized using differential interference contrast optics ( 43 ) .
Western blot analysis Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS .
Lysis buffer ( 0.05 M HEPES , 1 % Triton X-100 , 0.01 M sodium fluoride , 10 mM sodium vanadate , 25 mM benzamidine , 10 pg/ml aprotonin , 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 20 ug/ml PMSF , and 1 pg/ml leupeptin ) was added to cells at a final concentration of 1 X 10 `` cells/ml , and the lysate was stored at -80°C .
Cell lysates ( 10 pg ) were suspended in Laemmli gel sample buffer , boiled for 5 min , analyzed by SDS-PAGE , and electrotransferred onto Immobilon P membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) .
The membrane was blocked with PBS-5 % milk for 1 h and then immunoblotted with anti-mouse PCNA Ab ( Sigma ) ( 1:2000 ) or anti-PCREB ( UBI , Lake Placid , NY ) ( 1:2000 ) overnight at 4°C .
The blots were washed in PBS-tween , blocked with PBS-5 % milk , and incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) -conjugated Ab ( Sigma ) ( 1:10,000 ) .
The immunoreactive band was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Am-ersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
Cellular proliferation After treatment with IL-2 and rapamycin , as described above , L2 cells were plated on 96-well plates using 150 gl of each culture ( 1.5 X 10° cells/well ) and were pulsed for 2 h with 1 wCi of [ °HJthymidine/well .
Cells were harvested with a PHD cell harvester ( Cambridge Technology , Cambridge , MA ) .
The filters were placed in scintillation mixture , and [ H ] thymidine incorporation was assessed using a Wallac 1410 scintillation counter .
Results IL-2-stimulated CREB phosphorylation Resting murine-cloned T cells , L2 cells , were stimulated with IL-2 or treated with both IL-2 and rapamycin for 24 h. When total immunoreactive CREB was examined ( Figs .

L2 variant cells were rested for 24 h in IL-2-free medium and then were treated for 24 h with 100 U of IL-2 or 100 U of IL-2 with rapamycin ( 20 ng/ml ) .
L2 variant cells were labeled for phosphorylated CREB and total CREB using specific polyclonal Abs and a second Ab ( HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit ) as described in Materials and Methods .
As a negative control , cells were labeled with only the donkey anti-rabbit Ab to detect nonspecific secondary Ab binding .
all conditions consistent with our previous findings ( 16 ) .
We examined Ser'** CREB phosphorylation in L2 cells by immunohis-tochemistry and Western blot analysis ( Figs .
1 and 3 ) .
In an experiment representative of cells passed for less than 61 days , phosphorylated CREB was present in nuclei , and levels of phosphorylation increased following IL-2 stimulation .
IL-2-induced CREB phosphorylation was inhibited by rapamycin .
After greater than 91 days in passage , variant L2 cells emerged that had high basal levels of nuclear Ser'* > -phosphorylated CREB , with no increase following treatment with IL-2 and no decrease following treatment with rapamycin ( Figs .
2 and 3 ) .
The size of the variant cells appears to be reduced when compared with the parent cells ; the significance of this observation is not known .
Relationship of phosphorylated CREB to PCNA expression Biochemical and molecular consequences of IL-2 stimulation and rapamycin inhibition are assessed in the context of lymphocyte proliferation .

Cells were lysed as described in Materials and Methods .

and T cell proliferation ( 14 , 16 ) .
Since the late passage L2 variant cells contain constitutively high levels of phosphorylated Ser'** CREB , resting late passage variant cells were examined for potential increases in basal PCNA expression and the effect of IL-2 and rapamycin on PCNA expression and cellular proliferation ( Fig .
3 and Table I ) .
Resting late passage variant cells had low levels of PCNA similar to those found in parental L2 cells .
Furthermore , IL-2 induced , and rapamycin inhibited , both PCNA expression and cellular proliferation .
These findings indicate that CREB phosphorylation is not sufficient to drive these processes and that rapamycin does not inhibit PCNA expression primarily through inhibition of CREB activation .
IL-2-inducible kinase activity To determine the mechanism responsible for IL-2-inducible and constitutive phosphorylation of CREB , we assessed kinase activities in L2 and L2 variant cells .
PKA phosphorylation of CREB at Ser `` is well known ( 21-24 ) ; therefore , lysates were assayed for kinase activity using kemptide , a protein kinase A specific substrate .
PKA exists as an inactive holoenzyme that is dissociated into an active form in the presence of cAMP .
Assays done in the presence of cAMP reflect total kinase levels in the cell , and assays done in the absence of cAMP reflect the amount of kinase activity at the time of cell lysis .
The amount of kinase activity is expressed as a percent of the amount of activity in unstimulated L2 or L2 variant cells plus cAMP .

Protein kinase A activity in L2 and L2 variant .
L2 cells from short time of passage ( 21-63 days ) and L2 variant cells ( 91-140 days ) were rested for 24 h in IL-2-free medium and left unstimulated ( 0 ) , stimulated with IL-2 ( 100 U/ml ! )
alone for 24 h ( IL-2 ) , or stimulated with IL-2 in the presence of rapamycin ( 20 ng/m ! )
for 24 h ( IL-2+R ) .
Total protein was extracted from the cells , and 5.0 ug of protein was assayed for the ability to phosphorylate kemptide ( LRRASLG ) , a PKA-selective substrate .
Enzyme assays were done in the presence ( +cAMP ) or absence ( -cAMP ) of cAMP ( 10 uM ) .
Some enzyme assays were performed in the presence of 5 M PKI , a PKA-specific inhibitor .
Samples were assayed in duplicate , and an average of three experiments are shown .
Values are expressed as percent of 0 h + cAMP kinase activity , which for the three experiments was 84 , 94 , and 562 pmol phosphate transferred/min/mg protein for L2 cells and 301 , 711 , and 826 pmol phosphate transferred/min/mg protein for L2 variant cells .
increases following stimulation with IL-2 for 24 h ( Fig .
4 ) .
However PKA activity in the absence of cAMP reveals that only 27 % of the total kinase is active in resting cells .
Despite the substantial increase in PKA levels in IL-2-stimulated cells , the amount of active PKA remains unchanged .
Rapamycin treatment inhibited the IL-2-induced increase in PKA but had no effect on levels of active kinase .
Inhibition by PKI , a PKA-specific kinase inhibitor , indicates that the majority of kinase activity measured using kemptide can be attributed to PKA .
In the L2 variant , passed for greater than 91 days , a different pattern of kinase activity was seen after IL-2 stimulation .
Instead of an increase in PKA levels after IL-2 treatment , a decrease was observed .
The amount of active kinase remained low at 33 % and decreased after IL-2 treatment .
Rapamycin treatment had no effect on total or active PKA levels .
The reaction done in the presence of PKI again revealed that most of the kinase activity measured was PKA .
To determine the presence of other kinases that phosphorylate CREB , similar experiments were performed using crebtide as a substrate ( Fig .
5 ) .
Crebtide contains the Ser'* `` phosphorylation site of the CREB protein , which is required for transcriptional activation ( 30-33 ) .
In early passage L2 cells , IL-2 stimulation resulted in an increase in CREB kinase activity that was inhibited by rapamycin .
In contrast to PKA ( kemptide substrate ) , most of this kinase activity was cAMP independent and inhibited to a much lesser extent by PKI , indicating that CREB kinase activity is not PKA .
In L2 variant cells passed for greater than 91 days , IL-2 did not cause an increase in CREB kinase activity .

cAMP independent , and there was a greater resistance to inhibition with PKI than that seen with kemptide as a substrate .
In contrast to L2 cells , rapamycin had no inhibitory effect on the kinase activity .
Effect of cell aging on kinase activity The inability of IL-2 to induce kinase activity in older cultures appears to result from a change in basal kinase activity as the cultures age ( Fig .
6 ) .
PKA activity in cells passed for less than 63 days was at an average of 250 pmol phosphate transferred/min/mg protein and was inducible to an average of 640 pmol phosphate transferred/min/mg protein .
Cells that were passed for greater than 91 days had an average resting PKA level of 610 pmol phosphate transferred/min/mg protein and could not be induced .
When crebtide was used as the substrate , resting kinase activity in cells passed for fewer than 63 days was at an average of 90 pmol phosphate transferred/min/mg protein and was inducible to an average value of 500 pmol phosphate transferred/min/mg protein .
The average resting kinase activity of cells that were passed for greater than 91 days was 780 pmol phosphate transferred/min/mg protein and also could not be induced .
Thus , in aged cultures , basal kinase activity for each substrate was equal to or greater than the induced levels in younger cultures .
Rapamycin effect on kinase activity in vitro To determine whether rapamycin has a direct effect on the kinases studied , kinase activity was measured in the presence and absence of rapamycin ( Fig .
7 ) .
PKA and CREB kinase activities were not affected by rapamycin .
This implies that rapamycin exerts its inhibitory effect on the increase in kinase levels or kinase activation but not directly on kinase activity .

Discussion Stimulation of the murine-cloned T lymphocyte L2 with IL-2 drives entry and progression through the cell cycle ( 36 , 37 ) .
Increased PCNA expression has been shown in IL-2-stimulated T cells ( 13 ) ; there appears to be a close temporal link with the phosphorylation of CREB protein and the ability of proteins to bind to the PCNA CRE sequences ( 14 , 16 ) .
CRE sequences are required for optimal promoter activity , and rapamycin inhibits IL-2-stimulated CREB binding to these elements ( 5 ) .
The discovery of an L2 cell variant that has constitutively phosphorylated CREB allowed us to test the hypothesis that CREB activation is a key rapamycin-sensitive step in IL-2-stimulated PCNA expression and proliferation .
Phosphorylation of the Ser'* > residue on CREB has been shown to have great importance in gene expression and proliferation as shown by the inability of T cells expressing the dominate-negative form of CREB to produce IL-2 and undergo cell cycle progression ( 44 ) .
Phosphorylation of CREB has been shown to regulate binding of the protein to CRE sites ( 21 , 23 , 26 , 45 , 46 ) .
Maximal transcriptional activation of the PCNA promoter requires CREB/ ATF1 transcription factors following IL-2 stimulation ( 14 ) .
Previous data generated using the L2 cell line have shown an increase in PCNA expression after IL-2 stimulation and a decrease in the presence of rapamycin ( 5 ) .
Despite the high constitutive kinase activity and CREB phosphorylation in variant cells , PCNA expression was low in untreated and rapamycin-treated cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Thus , CREB activation alone is insufficient for PCNA gene expression .
CREB transcriptional activation has been shown to require other signals in T cells .
For example , CD28 signaling was required for full transcriptional activity of CREB in ELA cells , whereas Ser'** phospho-CREB alone was insufficient for CRE-CAT ( chloram-phenicol acetyltransferase ) gene expression ( 47 ) .

Total protein was extracted from the cells , and 5.0 ug of protein was assayed for the ability to phosphorylate kemptide ( LRRASLG ) , a PKA-selective substrate , or crebtide ( SRRPSYRK ) , a substrate that contains the Ser'** phosphorylation site of CREB .
Untreated and 24-h IL-2-stimulated L2 cells were assayed for kinase activity in the presence or absence of rapamycin ( 20 ng/m !
1 ) .
Results are expressed as picomole of phosphate transferred in a 10-min reaction .
Protein ( 2.5-5.0 ug ) was used for each reaction .
rkat cells CREB phosphorylation alone was insufficient for transcriptional regulation ; PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the CREB binding protein ( CBP ) was required .
( 48 ) .
CBP phosphorylation allows a complex to be formed with phospho-CREB , which then binds to the CRE .
Therefore , a similar form of control may be active in both L2 cells and L2 variant cells where a secondary IL-2-mediated phosphorylation event is required for PCNA transcription .
While the variant phenotype showed that CREB phosphorylation alone was insufficient for PCNA expression , there is strong evidence for an IL-2-inducible , rapamycin-sensitive kinase responsible for CREB activation that is required for optimal PCNA promoter activity ( 14 ) .
cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) was the first enzyme identified to phosphorylate CREB at Ser'* > ( 21-24 ) .
Increased intracellular levels of cAMP occur following mito-genic stimulation of splenic B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes ( 49 , 50 ) .
Elevation of cAMP induces the translocation of PKA to the nucleus ( 51 ) .
While this information suggests that IL-2-stim-ulation may act in part through PKA activation , other data argue against the role of PKA in CREB activation in T cells .
For example , IL-2 does not induce an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP during cell cycle progression in L2 cells ( 16 ) , and T cell proliferation is inhibited by high cAMP levels ( 35 , 52 ) , potentially through cAMP-blocking Raf-1 kinase ( 53 ) .
These conflicting data create a paradox ; two possible explanations include 1 ) a transient activation of PKA that is supported by the data , which show that there must be a rise followed by a decrease in cAMP levels for progression of T cells into S phase ( 50 ) , or 2 ) a kinase other than PKA activates CREB in IL-2-stimulated T cells .
This paradox led us to examine PKA levels in L2 and L2 variant cells .
The kinase activity responsible for kemptide phosphorylation is PKA , as demonstrated by the dependence on cAMP ( Fig .
4 ) and by the sensitivity of kinase activity to the inhibitor peptide , PKI ( 54 ) .
Since PKA activity was low and uninducible by IL-2 ( Fig .
4 ) , 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g 810 wor ; 664 PKA AND CREB KINASE ACTIVITY IN IL-2-STIMULATED T CELLS it seems likely that another kinase may be phosphorylating CREB in IL-2-stimulated cells .
To determine other possible kinase activ-ities , the substrate crebtide was used in the kinase assays .
Crebtide is a 9-amino acid peptide ( SRRPSYRK ) containing the Ser'* > phosphorylation site shown to be important in the regulation of CREB interactions with DNA and other regulatory proteins ( 21-24 , 55 ) .
Phosphorylation of crebtide reflects phosphorylation of endogenous CREB protein ( 56 ) .
When using crebtide as the substrate , the presence of a cAMP-independent , IL-2-inducible , rapamycin-sensitive kinase was shown in the parental cell line ( Fig .
5 ) .
This was demonstrated by the observation that almost 100 % of the CREB kinase was active ( -cAMP ) on the crebtide substrate ( Fig .
5 ) , while only about 25 % of the PKA kinase was active ( -cAMP ) on the kemptide substrate ( Fig .
4 ) .
This kinase was relatively resistant to the PKA inhibitor , PKI , further supporting the notion that it is not PKA .
Kinases other than PKA can mediate phosphorylation of CREB at or the corresponding Ser residue on CRE modulator ( CREM ) , such as p90®°* ( 27 ) , RSK2 ( 29 ) , Ca* * /calmodulin kinase II ( 26 , 57 ) , a Ras-dependent protein kinase ( 25 ) , PKC ( 58 , 59 ) , and p70®® kinase ( 59 ) .
Of these kinases , the activities of p70®® kinase ( 60-62 ) and PKC ( 63 ) are affected by rapamycin .
While PKC can mediate p70®° kinase phosphorylation , rapamycin appears to act downstream of PKC-mediated p70°®° kinase activation ( 64 ) .
A rapamycin-sensitive kinase in T cells in the pathway to activation of p70°® kinase is FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein ( FRAP ) ( 65 ) .
p70 kinase has been shown to be stimulated in murine T cells by IL-2 ( 66 ) and inhibited by rapamycin ( 60 , 61 ) .
Interestingly , p70°®° kinase activity can be inhibited by cAMP acting through PKA ( 64 ) .
In our cells , active PKA levels are only slightly above baseline in resting and IL-2-stimulated cells ( Fig .
4 ) , which would potentially allow for normal activity of p70®° kinase .
Our results indicate that the increase in CREB kinase activity is sensitive to rapamycin ( Fig .
5 ) , but the kinase is not affected directly by rapamycin ( Fig .
7 ) .
Previous studies have shown that p70°®® kinase activation is rapamycin sensitive , but enzyme activity is not inhibited directly by rapamycin ( 67 ) .
Thus one possibility would be that rapamycin inhibits FRAP blocking p70°® kinase activation and CREB phosphorylation .
We have demonstrated the existence of an L2 variant expressing constitutively phosphorylated Ser'** CREB .
In this variant , constitutive CREB phosphorylation alone is not sufficient to drive PCNA expression and cellular proliferation .
L2 cells express a kinase other than PKA that is capable of phosphorylating CREB at Ser ' `` > ; based on the IL-2 inducibility and sensitivity to rapamycin , p70°° kinase is a candidate kinase .
Thus , while CREB phosphorylation plays a role in the control of gene expression and proliferation of T cells , there are other rapamycin-sensitive events that are the rate limiting steps in IL-2-driven T cell proliferation .
