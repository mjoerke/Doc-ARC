6 The Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) ORJI ; , , , Enhancer Is Not B-Cell Specific and Does Not Respond Synergistically to the EBV Transcription Factors R and Z HENRI GRUFFAT , NANCY MORENO , anp ALAIN SERGEANT* Laboratoire de Virologie Moléculaire , Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon , 46 , Allée d'Italie , 69364 Lyon Cedex 07 , France Received 26 October 1989/Accepted 12 March 1990 The Epstein-Barr virus DR promoter is located upstream of the Psfl repeats , and in addition to the TATA box , it contains an upstream region ( positions -69 to -220 ) responsive to EB1 ( Z ) ( the BZLF1-encoded transcription factor ) and an enhancer with two functionally distinct domains , A and B. Domain B has been described as a B-cell-specific EB1-responsive element ( P. M. Lieberman , J. M. Hardwick , and S. D. Hayward , J. Virol .
63:3040-3050 , 1989 ) activated synergistically by EB1 and R , an EBV early product encoded by the open reading frame BRLFI1 ( M. A. Cox , J. Leahy , and J. M. Hardwick , J. Virol .
64:313-321 , 1990 ) .
We show here that domain B is an R-responsive element in HeLa cells and is therefore not an EBl-responsive B-cell-specific element .
However , there is an EBl-binding site ( ZRE-B ) located within the R-responsive enhancer region .
ZRE-B can be deleted without affecting the R-dependent enhancer activity .
Moreover , there is no cooperation or synergy between R and EB1 when activating the B domain ( ZRE-B plus the R-responsive element ) positioned as an enhancer .
ZRE-B is therefore not part of the R-inducible enhancer .
We have tested several subregions of the DR enhancer B domain , either alone or in combination , for their capacity to transmit the R-activating signal to the rabbit B-globin promoter .
We found that the R-responsive element is composed of four protoenhancers that span the whole B domain .
These protoenhancers alone are weakly or not responsive to R. One of the protoenhancers contains the overlapping palindromes S5'-TTGTCCegtGGACAAaTGTCC-3 ' .
However , one palindrome , either alone or duplicated , or the overlapping palindromes did not respond to R. The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a human herpesvirus which infects and immortalizes peripheral B lymphocytes , resulting in the establishment of a latent infection .
In such latently infected B cells , the entire EBV genome is maintained mainly as a plasmid , and its expression is reduced to a few genes , those encoding the following : two small RNAs ( EBERS ) ( 28 ) , the six nuclear proteins EBNA-1 , -2 , -3A , -3B , -3C , and LP ( 32 ) , the BHRF1l-encoded product ( 2 ) , the latent membrane protein ( 20 ) , and the terminal membrane protein , whose coding sequence is created by joining the ends of the linear virus ( 27 , 35 ) .
The latent EBV genome is spontaneously activated in particular cell lines , in which between 0.5 and 5 % of the cells produce viruses .
It can also be activated by various chemical agents , including the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) ( 31 , 38 ) .
In both cases , the activation seems to be linked to the expression of two EBV-encoded transactivators of early-gene promoters , EB1 and R ( 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 18 , 36 ) .
EB1 is encoded by the open reading frame ( ORF ) BZLF1 and is expressed from two promoters , PZ and PR , either as a 1-kilobase monocistronic mRNA or as 3- and 4-kilobase mRNAs generated by alternative splicing and expressing both EB1 and R , the BRLF1 ORF-encoded factor ( Fig .
1 ) ( 30 ) .
EB1 seems to have a key role in the induction of the lytic cycle ( 6 , 9 , 10 , 32 ) .
It is a DNA-binding protein ( 13 ) that positively autoregulates its own promoters and activates transcription from quite different responsive elements , including AP-1-binding sites ( 30 , 37 ) .
EB1 does not seem to be a factor that can act at distances more than 100 to 200 base pairs ( bp ) from the TATA box ( 37 ) .
R seems to be a factor * Corresponding author .
2810 that can act at distances of thousands of base pairs , and two R targets have been identified : one in the EBV DR/DL enhancer B domain ( 5 ) and one in the promoter controlling the expression of EB2 , the BMLF1I- and BSLF2-encoded posttranscriptional activator ( 3 , 25 ) .
The EBV DR promoter is homologous to the DL promoter ( 1 , 12 , 14 , 24 ) ( Fig .
1 ) .
These duplicate promoters are located 100 kilobase pairs ( kbp ) from each other , one in the right part ( DR ) and the other in the left part ( DL ) of the EBV genome ( Fig .
1 ) ( 19 , 21 , 23 , 24 ) .
In addition , some cis-acting elements of the DL promoter could be bidirectional and could control in a rightward direction the expression of the EA-R ORF BHRF1 ( 18 ) .
The DR and DL promoters are not detectably active during latency .
However , after disruption of latency , they become active and overlap with origins of replication ( ORI , , , ) functional only during the lytic cycle ( 17 ) .
ORI ; , , activity is dependent on the EBV-encoded DNA polymerase ( 17 ) , the BZLF1l-encoded transcription factor EB1 , and the presence of an enhancer located upstream of the DR/DL TATA boxes ( 4 , 5 , 17 ; Fig .
1 ) .
This enhancer has two domains , A and B. Domain A is constitutively active in all cell lines tested but does not function in lymphoid B cells , and domain B is transactivated by R in all cell lines tested ( 5 ) .
Domain B is also activated by EB1 , but only in EBV genome-positive cells , demonstrating that in these cells , R is induced by EB1l ( 5 ) .
One R target in the DR enhancer B domain has been reduced to 28 bp and contains the double palindromic sequence TTGTCCCGTGGACAATGTCC .
Part of this region , CCGTGGAGAATGTC , is partially conserved in the R-inducible enhancer identified in the EB2 promoter ( 3 , 8 , 25 ) .
However , when this 28-bp DNA fragment was placed upstream from the rabbit B-globin promoter , this promoter became responsive to R , but the level Vor .

Schematic structures of DR enhancer mutations and of S1 nuclease DNA probes .
( A ) Two EBV ORFs have been shown to code for transcription factors ; BZLF1 codes for EB1 , and BRLFI codes for R. One target each ( MI ) for EB1 ( 4 , 5 ) and R ( 5 ) has been identified in the DR promoter .
The R-responsive region denoted domain B has been mutated by progressive deletion , and the mutations are shown ( thick lines ) .
Numbers on both ends of the thick lines indicate the endpoints of the deletions in domain B with respect to position 52788 as -1 on the EBV B95-8 sequence .

The B-globin and SV40 early TATA boxes are underlined .
of activation was only 15 to 20 % of the level of activation observed when domain B was placed upstream of the B-globin promoter ( 5 ) .
This suggested that other sequences in the B domain were required in order to have a fully active R-responsive element ( RRE ) .
However , recent reports are at odds with the above results and suggest that the B domain is in fact a B-cell-specific enhancer induced by EB1 ( 29 ) and responds synergistically to EB1 and R ( 11 ) .
In this report , we demonstrate and confirm that the ORI ; , , enhancer is not a B-cell-specific EBl-responsive element .
It is in fact induced by R and does not respond synergically to Z and R when positioned as an enhancer .
In our study , we also defined more precisely the sequences involved in the enhancer function described above .
We synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to DNA subfragments of domain B of the DR enhancer .
The enhancer activity of these oligonucleotides , either alone or as various heterodimers , was evaluated as their ability to activate transcription from the rabbit B-globin promoter after cotransfection into HeLa cells with an R-expressing vector .
We found that the RRE is located in a 75-bp DNA fragment containing three regions which are weakly or not responsive to R. However , these three regions are required in order to obtain a full R-responsive enhancer and might therefore act cooperatively .
ORL , , ENHANCER TRANSACTIVATION 2811 MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloned DNA templates .
The EB1- and R-expressing vectors have been described extensively elsewhere ( 5 ) .
Briefly , they are pUC18 derivatives containing the ORFs BZLF1 and BRLF1 , which code , respectively , for the EBV transactivat-ing factors EB1 and R , placed under the control of the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) early promoter-enhancer .
Plasmids pG1 and pG2 contain the rabbit B-globin gene with the Ml3mp12 polylinker cloned 5 ' to the -globin promoter ( 22 ) .
Plasmids pG2.899/741 , pG2.899/752 , pG2.899/775 , pG2.899/812 , pG2.737/805 , pG2.765/737 , pG2.765/7372x , pG2.765/754 , pG2.765/754x2 , pG2.764/752 , pG2.783/761 , pG2.810/789 , pG2.764/745 , pG2.781/752 , pG2.783/737 , pG2.783/741 , and pG2.899/812 were made by ligating subregions of the B domain of the DR enhancer 425 bp 5 to the B-globin promoter ( see Fig .
2B and 3B ) .
Plasmids pG1.899/741 and pG1.741/899 were made by ligating domain B in both orientations -109 bp 5 ' to the B-globin promoter ( see Fig .
6A ) .
Plasmid pG1.741/899 was opened at the unique Xbal site , digested with BAL 31 nuclease , treated with T4 DNA polymerase , and recircularized .
In one of the deletion mutants pG3.741/861 ; see Fig .
6B ) , Z-responsive element B ( ZRE-B ) was brought -106 bp upstream from the B-globin +1 .
Plasmid pG4.741/899 was generated by ligating domain B in inverted orientation 37 bp upstream from the B-globin TATA box .
All clones were verified by sequencing .
Numbers after pG2 or pG1 describe the position and the orientation of the border of the inserted B domain subregions and refer to the map coordinates described in Fig .
1A and 2A .
Plasmid pSV2 $ B ( 3 ) expresses a chimeric SV40-B-globin RNA and was cotransfected as an internal control for transient-expression experiments .
Plasmid pSVO contains the SV40 Haplt ( map position 346 ) -to-HindlIII ( map position 5171 ) fragment cloned in pUC19 digested with HindIII and BamHI .
This plasmid was included in transfections to keep the amount of SV40 early promoter sequences constant , since EB1 and R are expressed under the control of the SV40 early promoter .
Bacterial expression of EBI proteins .
A cDNA containing the complete EB1l-coding sequence except for the two AUGs was inserted in the EcoRI site of the protein A gene fusion vector pRIT2T ( 33 ) .
The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli HB1O1 and purified by chromatography on an immunoglobulin G-Sepharose 4B column essentially as described previously ( 33 ) .
EMSA assay .
For the electrophoresis mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) , 1 to 2 ug of protein A-EB1l was incubated with 15,000 cpm of an 87-bp *°P-labeled DNA fragment encompassing ZRE-B from positions -812 to -899 ( Fig .
2A ) .
Incubations were carried out in 1 mM MgCl , -20 mM HEPES ( N - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - N ' - 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ) -KOH ( pH 7.9 ) -0.5 mM dithiothreitol-0.5 mM phenyImethyl-sulfonyl fluoride-20 mM KCI-20 % glycerol-10 uM zinc at 4°C for 20 min .
The mixture was loaded onto a 4 % polyacryl-amide-0.5x TBE ( Tris-borate-EDTA ) gel ( 29:1 cross-linked ) .
The protein A-EB1I-ZRE-B complexes were separated from the noncomplexed DNA by migration at 10 V/cm .
The results of the experiment were visualized by autoradiography .
Dimethyl sulfate interference .
Two hundred thousand counts per minute of the 87-bp DNA probe was methylated with 1 pl of dimethyl sulfate for 3 min at 18°C .
The methylated probe was then incubated with 1 to 2 pg of protein A-EB1 .
After EMSA , the retarded DNA probe and the nonretarded DNA probe were electroeluted and incu- 2812 GRUFFAT ET AL .
bated in 100 pi of 1 M piperidine for 30 min at 90°C .
Equal amounts of the radioactive retarded and nonretarded probes were analyzed on 8 % polyacrylamide sequencing gels and visualized by autoradiography .
Cell culture and transfections .
HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium ( GIBCO Laboratories ) supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) fetal calf serum .
The plasmids used for transfection were prepared by the alkaline lysis method and purified through two CsCl gradients .
HeLa cells were seeded at 10° cells per 100-mm-diameter petri dish 24 h before transfection , and the medium was changed 4 h before transfection .
Transfections were performed by the calcium precipitate method ( 16 ) .
Cells were mixed with the appropriate DNA ( s ) , and all of the DNAs were in the same topological state , as assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis .
Usually , 15 pg of DNA was used per 100-mm-diameter dish , including the following : 1 wg of R-expressing vector or 2 ug of EBl-expressing vector , 4 ug of reporter promoters , pSVO when required , 1 pug of pSV2B as an internal control , and pUC19 ( up to 15 ug ) .
RNA extraction and S1 nuclease mapping .
The cells transfected with plasmids carrying the B-globin gene were lysed by Nonidet P-40 as described elsewhere ( 22 ) .
The nuclei were pelleted , and RNA was phenol extracted from the cytoplasmic fraction .
Ten to forty micrograms of total cytoplasmic RNA was hybridized overnight at 30°C in 50 % formamide-0.3 M NaCl-0.01 M Tris hydrochloride ( pH 7.4 ) to 5 ' P-labeled synthetic single-stranded DNA probes ( Fig .
1B ) .
The hybrids were digested for 2 h at 20°C with 5 U of S1 nuclease per 10 ug of RNA .
The size of the Sl-protected DNA fragment was analyzed on 6 % ( wt/vol ) acrylamide-8.3 M urea gels .
RESULTS The enhancer B domain is not B-cell specific and responds to R. We have previously reported that DR enhancer mutants obtained by progressive deletion from the 5 ' end of the B domain and cloned upstream of the SV40 enhancerless early promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene responded to R in a non-cell-specific manner ( 5 ) .
One R-responsive element was located in a 28-bp fragment containing a double palindrome , TTGTCCegtGGACAAT GTCC .
Since recent reports described the DR/DL enhancer as EB1 inducible and B-cell specific ( 29 ) , we wanted to confirm or disconfirm this statement .
We therefore determined by quantitative S1 analysis if the DR enhancer mutants were responsive to R in HeLa cells when placed 425 bp upstream of the rabbit B-globin promoter ( Fig .
2A ) and if the palindrome GGACAaTGTCC was an R-responsive enhan-son ( 15 ) .
The B domain ( Fig .
2C , lane 2 ) and some of the B-domain subfragments ( Fig .
2C , lanes 3 to 5 ) increased ( about threefold ) the basal activity of the B-globin promoter in plasmid pG2 ( Fig .
2C , lane 1 ) , suggesting that cellular factors participate in the function of this enhancer .
R strongly stimulated the expression of specific B-globin transcripts when domain B was inserted 5 ' to the B-globin promoter ( Fig .
2C , lane 9 ) .
Deletion of sequences between bp -741 and -752 had no apparent effect on the R stimulation ( Fig .
2C , lane 10 ) .
It is possible that the effect of the deletion could be compensated by the amount of R protein expressed .
We therefore decreased by a factor of 10 the amount of the R-expressing vector cotransfected with mutants pG2.899/741 and pG2.899/752 .
In that case , deletion of sequences between bp -741 and -752 reduced the R induction by less than a factor of two ( not shown ) .

The sizes of the remaining DNA sequences in the mutants are indicated by thick lines , and the numbers indicate the endpoints of the deletion for each mutation .

sequences between bp -752 and -775 impaired the induction of B-globin transcripts by R ( Fig .
2C , lanes 10 to 12 ) .
However , it should be noted that the remaining sequences in mutant pG2.765/737 still retained a low , but clear , potential to be activated by R. This was already seen when the same mutants were linked to the SV40 early promoter ( 5 ) and suggested that there is an RRE ( or RREs ) located between position -812 and position -899 .
The region located between bp -741 and -775 contains the two partially overlapping palindromic sequences TTGTCCCGTGGACAA and GGACAATGTCC ( Fig .
2A ) .
A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide , _ CTGTGCCITTGTCCCGTGGACAATGT CCC , containing these two palindromes was cloned 425 bp upstream from the B-globin promoter ( plasmid pG2.765/737 ; Fig .
2B ) .
The amount of B-globin transcripts expressed from the B-globin promoter ( Fig .
2C , lane 1 ) was not significantly influenced by the insertion of this oligonucleotide ( Fig .
2C , lane 6 ) .
However , R increased the amount of specific B-globin RNAs expressed from plasmid pG2.765/737 ( Fig .
2C , lane 13 ) as compared with plasmid pG2 ( Fig .
2C , lane 8 ) .
We then tested whether the palindrome GGACAATGTCC was Vor .
64 , 1990 an RRE .
The answer was no .
This oligonucleotide was inserted 5 ' to the B-globin promoter ( plasmid pG2.754/765 ; Fig .
2B ) .
The amount of specific B-globin transcripts expressed from the B-globin promoter ( Fig .
2C , lane 1 ) was not influenced by the insertion of this oligonucleotide in the 5 ' position ( Fig .
2C , lane 7 ) .
Moreover , R had no effect on the expression of B-globin transcripts expressed from the B-globin promoter in plasmid pG2.754/765 ( Fig .
2C , lane 14 ) .
We therefore confirmed that the B domain was not B-cell specific but instead was active in HeLa cells and strongly induced by R. The R-responsive enhancer is composed of several domains responding cooperatively to R. Sequences located between positions -737 and -765 and containing a double palindromic sequence transmit the activation by R to the B-globin promoter , but the level of activation ( Fig .
2C , lane 13 ) is lower than the level of activation by R through the B domain by a factor of about four ( Fig .
2C , lane 9 ) .
Moreover , one palindrome does not respond to R. However , mutant pG2.899/752 ( Fig .
2A ) contains one palindrome and downstream sequences but responds to R ( Fig .
2C , lane 10 ) , although mutant pG2.899/775 ( Fig .
2B ) does not respond to R ( Fig .
2C , lane 11 ) .
Moreover , mutant pG2.737/805 , which contains sequences located between positions -737 and -805 ( see Fig .
5 , lane 10 ) contains a full RRE .
Therefore , sequences between positions -741 and -805 must contain the R-responsive enhancer ( Fig .
2A ) .
In order to characterize further this putative R-responsive region , several double-stranded oligonucleotides that cover sequences between positions -737 and -805 have been synthesized ( Fig .
3A ) .
These oligonucleotides have been ligated 425 bp upstream of the B-globin promoter either alone or in combination ( Fig .
3B ) .
The resulting plasmids were transfected in HeLa cells , and their response to R was evaluated by S1 nuclease digestion ( Fig .
3C ) .
Quantitation was done on three different transfections ( one typical experiment is presented in Fig .
3C ) by cutting the specific S1-protected radioactive bands from the gels and by counting the radioactivity .
The results were corrected as follows : ( i ) according to the efficiency of transfection as evaluated by counting the radioactivity present in Sl-protected bands corresponding to specific SV40 early RNAs expressed from plasmid pSV2§B ( 2 ) cotransfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency ( Fig .
3D ) and ( ii ) according to the activities of the different constructions in the absence of R. The results of quantification ( average ) are presented in Fig .
3B .
The main conclusions from these experiments are the following .
As already shown , the enhancer B domain between positions -899 and -752 can constitutively increase about threefold the B-globin promoter activity ( Fig .
3C , compare lanes 9 and 1 ) .
Sequences between positions -737 and -765 contain a protoenhancer that has 15 % ( Fig .
3B ) of the R-induced enhancer activity ( Fig .
3C , compare lanes 2 and 11 ) .
This protoenhancer can not be reduced to a shorter element , since no subregion responded to R ( Fig .
3B ) .
However , the protoenhancer activity increased to 44 % of the R-induced enhancer activity when it was linked to sequences between positions -765 and -783 and extended from positions -737 to -783 ( Fig .
3C , lane 14 ) .
However , the DNA sequence between positions -761 and -783 had no constitutive activity ( Fig .
3C , lane 3 ) and was not responsive to R , as compared with pG2 itself ( Fig .
3C , compare lane 3 with lane 12 and lane 9 with lane 18 ) .
These two regions then seemed to have more than an additive effect .
However , even when these two regions were linked together , they only ORL , , ENHANCER TRANSACTIVATION 2813 -~ WW UIHIII FIG .

Characterization of the RRE .
( A ) Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides used to characterize the RRE are listed under the genomic sequence .
( B ) The double-stranded oligonucleotides were ligated to plasmid pG2 , and the relative responsiveness to R of the resulting recombinant genes was determined by quantitative S1 analysis as described in Results , with three separate experiments .
( C ) Display of one typical quantitative S1 analysis of B-globin RNA expressed from some of the plasmids described above .
The plasmids were transfected in HeLa cells without ( -R , lanes 1 to 9 ) or with ( +R , lanes 10 to 18 ) a vector expressing R. The single-stranded DNA probe is the one shown in Fig .
1B .
( D ) Quantitative S1 nuclease analysis of RNA expressed from plasmid pSV2 $ cotransfected as an internal control .
The S1 probe sequence is shown in Fig .
1B .
The number above each lane corresponds to the samples presented in panel C. accounted for about 52 % of the R-dependent enhancer activity , suggesting that another region is required in order to reach 100 % of activity .
This region is probably located between positions -789 and -810 , since mutant pG2.737/ 805 has full enhancer activity as compared with mutant pG2.899/752 ( see Fig .
5B , compare lanes 6 and 10 ) .
However , this region is not responsive to R ( Fig .
3B , mutant pG2.810/789 ) .
We could therefore conclude that one RRE is probably composed of three protoenhancers ( 15 ) that could act cooperatively to mediate the response to R. The EB1-binding site located upstream of the RRE is not an EB1-inducible enhanson .
It has been reported that the RRE described above was in fact a B-cell-specific EB1l-responsive element ( 29 ) that could respond synergistically to EB1 and R ( 11 ) .
This is clearly not the case , as demonstrated by the results presented above and by previously published results from our laboratory ( 5 ) .
However , if there were an EB1-binding site located close to the RRE , EB1 might contribute 2814 GRUFFAT ET AL .

4A , lanes 7 to 9 ; ZRE-Z is an EBl-binding site present in the BZLF1 promoter [ 28 ] ) but was not competed out by ZRE-Z2 ( Fig .
4A , lane 10 ) , which does not bind EB1 ( G. Urier , personal communication ) .
Dimethyl sulfate interference ( Fig .
4B ) demonstrated that this EBl-protein A hybrid interacted specifically with the TGACACAC motif .
To test whether this EBl-binding site was a functional enhancer element and could contribute to the R response , plasmids pG2 , pG2.899/752 , pG2.899/812 , and pG2.737/805 ( Fig .
5A ) were transfected in HeLa cells either alone or together with an EB1- and/or an R-expressing vector .
In these plasmids , ZRE-B is localized about 500 bp upstream of the B-globin initiation site .
This position can be considered to be far enough from the B-globin initiation site to test its enhancer properties in a very general sense , since we have reported that two other ZREs could render the B-globin promoter responsive to EB1 when localized at position -100 upstream of the TATA box but lost their activity when localized at position -425 ( 37 ) .
Plasmid pSV2B was cotransfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency , and the quantity of SV40-B-globin transcripts was almost equal in every transfection ( Fig .
5D ) .
As detected by quantitative S1 analysis , the B-globin promoter in plasmid pG2 had a weak basal activity ( Fig .
5C , lane 1 ) .
However , as already observed above , the B-globin promoter activity in plasmid pG2 was increased by twofold when the plasmid was cotransfected with an R-expressing vector ( Fig .
5C , lane 2 ) , or with EB1l- and R-expressing vectors ( Fig .
5C , lane 4 ) .
This basal activity was not influ- Vor .

enced by EB1 ( Fig .
5C , lane 3 ) .
Plasmid pG2.899/752 , which carried both RREs and the EBl-binding site located upstream of the -globin promoter , had a higher basal activity because of the constitutive activity of the enhancer ( Fig .
5C , lane 5 ) ; as expected , this basal activity was strongly activated by R ( Fig .
5C , lane 6 ) but not by EB1 ( Fig .
5C , lane 7 ) , and there was no additive effect with EB1 plus R ( Fig .
5C , lane 8 ) as compared with R alone ( Fig .
5C , lane 6 ) .
It should be pointed out that EB1 seems to have an effect on plasmid pG2.899/752 ( Fig .
5B , compare lanes 5 and 7 ) , but this effect is also found in the controls ( Fig .
5C , lanes 5 and 7 ) .
Plasmid pG2.737/805 , which carried only the RRE upstream of the B-globin promoter , had a basal activity comparable to that of pG2.899/752 ( Fig .
5C , lane 9 ) .
This basal activity was strongly activated by R ( Fig .
5C , lane 10 ) , and the level of activation was comparable to that observed with plasmid pG2.899/752 ( Fig .
5C , lane 6 ) .
Again , EB1 had no significant effect on the basal activity of the B-globin promoter in plasmid pG2.737/805 ( Fig .
5C , lane 11 ) , and there was no additional effect with EB1 plus R ( Fig .
5C , lane 12 ) .
Plasmid pG2.899/812 contained only the EB1l-binding site located 5 ' to the B-globin promoter .
The B-globin promoter in this plasmid had a weak basal activity ( Fig .
5C , lane 13 ) , and this basal activity was significantly altered by R ( Fig .
5C , lane 14 ) but not by EB1 ( Fig .
5C , lane 15 ) ; once again , there was no additive effect with EB1 plus R ( Fig .
5C , lane 16 ) .
These last results clearly demonstrated that ZRE-B was not signifi- ORL , , ENHANCER TRANSACTIVATION 2815 cantly active when localized more than 425 bp upstream from the B-globin promoter and was not part of the R-inducible enhancer .
Moreover , no synergy , i.e .
, a more than multiplicative effect between EB1 and R , could be detected .
These results also show that EBV sequences located between positions -805 and -858 contain an RRE ( or RREs ) and should be considered as part of the R-inducible enhancer .
ZRE-B is active when located close to the TATA box , in which case R and EB1 effects can be additive .
From the results presented above , it was not possible to detect a synergy between EBl and R. However , to observe synergy , one might have to reduce the R activation and move ZRE-B very close to the B-globin TATA box , as is the situation in the putative EA-R promoter ( 29 ) , on which synergy between EB1 and R is detected ( 11 ) .
Reducing R activation should be possible either by decreasing the amount of R-expressing vector or by deleting all of the B-globin promoter upstream elements , keeping only the TATA box .
We therefore placed the B domain upstream of the B-globin initiation sites , and ZRE-B was then located at positions -549 ( plasmid pG2.899/741 ) , -106 ( plasmid pG3.741/861 ) , and -113 ( plasmid pG4.741/899 ) ; in this last construction , the B-globin promoter upstream elements were deleted ( Fig .
6A through C ) .
These plasmids were transfected in HeLa cells , and their responses to increasing amounts of EB1 , increasing amounts of R , and increasing amounts of R plus constant amounts of EBl were evaluated .
The autoradiographs presented were overexposed in order to detect the basal activity of the B-globin promoter .
However , the effects of EB1 , R , and EB1 plus R were quanti-tated , whenever possible , by the scanning of autoradiographs exposed for a short time ( Fig .
6 , see inserts in each panel ) .
Plasmid PSV2B was cotransfected as an internal control , and quantification of the amount of specifically initiated SV40-B-globin RNAs is presented in Fig .
6 ( lanes labeled * `` pSV2 $ B internal control specific transcription `` or `` pSV2B `` ) .
The B-globin promoter basal activity in plasmid pG2.899/ 741 ( Fig .
6A ) was not increased by increasing amounts of EBl-expressing vector ( Fig .
6A , lanes 3 to 5 ) .
The fact that the Sl-protected radioactivity seemed to be higher in the absence of EB1 ( lane 1 ) than with an increasing amount of EBI1 ( lanes 2 to 4 ) is due to variations in the surface of the radioactive bands .
This basal activity increased proportionally with an increase in the amount of R-expressing vector from 20 to 500 ng ( Fig .
6A , lanes 5 to 7 ) and then reached a plateau ( Fig .
6A , lane 8 ) .
However , cotransfecting a constant amount of EBl-expressing vector with increasing amounts of R-expressing vectors did not have even an additive effect on the level of R transactivation , except maybe at low R concentration ( Fig .
6A , lanes 9 to 12 ) .
When ZRE-B was localized at position -106 ( plasmid pG3.741/861 ; Fig .
6B ) , the basal activity of the B-globin promoter ( Fig .
6B , lane 1 ) was detectably increased by increasing amounts of EBl ( Fig .
6B , lanes 2 to 4 ) .
This showed that ZRE-B becomes active when located closer to the TATA box .
The basal activity of the B-globin promoter increased proportionally with an increase in the amount of R-expressing vector from 20 to 100 ng ( Fig .
6B , lanes 5 and 6 ) and then reached a plateau ( Fig .
6B , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Interestingly , an additive effect between EBl and R was detected when 2 ug of EBl-expressing vector were cotransfected with 20 ng of R-expressing vector ( Fig .
6B , lane 9 ) .
At higher R-expressing vector concentrations , no additive effect of EB1 ( Fig .
6B , lanes 10 to 12 ) was observed .

Plasmid pG2.899/741 ( A ) , plasmid pG3.741/861 ( B ) , and plasmid pG4.741/899 ( C ) were transfected in HeLa cells either alone ( lane 1 ) , with increasing amounts of EB1l-expressing vector ( lanes 2 to 4 ) , with increasing amounts of R-expressing vector ( lanes 5 to 8 ) , or with a constant amount of EBl-expressing vector plus increasing amounts of R-expressing vectors ( lanes 9 to 12 ) , as indicated in the upper parts of the panels .
In each panel , an insert represents a shorter exposure of the gel .
HeLa cells were transfected with the DNA constructs and the EB1- and R-expressing vectors ( D ) , as indicated in the upper part of the panel .
pSV2B was cotransfected as an internal control .
Horizontal arrows indicate specific initiation sites in all panels .
ZRE-B was also localized at position -113 upstream from the B-globin promoter from which all the upstream elements except the TATA box had been deleted ( plasmid pG4.741/ 899 ; Fig .
6C ) .
The basal activity of the B-globin promoter in this plasmid was no longer detectable ( Fig .
6C , lane 1 ) .
Although this is not apparent on the autoradiograph , except in lane 4 , the basal activity was increased by increasing the amount of EB1 ( Fig .
6C , lanes 2 to 4 ) .
The B-globin promoter in plasmid pG4.741/899 was strongly activated by increasing the amount of R-expressing vector from 20 to 500 ng ( Fig .
6C , lanes 5 to 7 ) and then reached a plateau ( Fig .
6C , lane 8 ) .
Surprisingly , more than an additive effect between EB1 and R was seen at a low R concentration ( Fig .
6C , lane 9 ) .
At higher R concentrations , an additive effect of EB1l was observed ( Fig .
6C , lanes 10 to 12 ) .
J. ViroL .
The three plasmids were also compared in the same transfection .
The distance from the B-globin gene +1 at which the RRE was located had a weak effect on the R inducibility of the B-globin promoter and was not dependent on the amount of R expressed ( Fig .
6D , lanes 1 to 4 ) .
However , deletion of the B-globin upstream elements reduced the R induction by a factor of three ( Fig .
6D , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Again , there was no additive effect or synergy between EB1 and R when the EBl-responsive element was localized at position -549 ( Fig .
6D , compare lanes 1 and 7 ) .
An additive effect between EB1 and R was observed when ZRE-B was located at position -106 ( Fig .
6D , compare lanes 3 and 8 ) .
A more than additive effect between EB1 and R was observed when the B-globin upstream elements were deleted ( Fig .
6D ; compare lanes 5 and 9 ) .
In conclusion , the R-responsive element was not dependent on EB1 to function , but an additive effect between R and EB1 could be detected when the EB1-responsive ZRE-B element was positioned as an upstream element and at low R concentrations .
In no case could we detect a more than multiplicative effect corresponding to synergy between EB1l and R. DISCUSSION We have previously shown that the DR/DL promoter contains a cis-acting element that acts as an enhancer inducible by the EBV-encoded factor R ( 5 ) .
In the studies presented here , careful analysis of the R-inducible DR enhancer allowed us to conclude that an R-responsive enhancer carrying 54 % of the R-inducible activity seems to be included in a 47-bp-long DNA fragment containing two domains acting cooperatively .
One region located between positions -741 and -765 responds to R , but the level of the response is only 15 % of the full activity .
None of the subfragments in this region possesses a significant R-responsive activity .
Even the double palindromic region TTGTCCCGTGGACAATGTCC , either singly or duplicated , did not respond significantly to R. Another R-responsive enhancer has been characterized in the promoter ( PM ) localized upstream from the BMLFI open reading frame ( 3 , 25 ) .
Deletion of the sequence AGAATGTCTGC severely impaired R induction ( 3 ) .
This sequence is an imperfect duplication of a sequence conserved between the two enhancers CCGTGGAG or CAAT GTC ( 25 ) .
However , a 38-bp oligonucleotide containing the region conserved in promoter PM did not confer R responsiveness to the B-globin promoter ( 3 ) .
Moreover , bidirectional mutagenesis in the PM promoter RRE clearly shows that this enhancer is also composed of several elements acting cooperatively ( M. Buisson , personal communication ) .
The region consisting of positions -761 to -783 is not responsive to R but strongly increased the R responsiveness when associated with the region comprising positions -741 to -765 .
This region might bind a cellular factor acting cooperatively when linked to an activated RRE .
Indeed , deletion of this region impairs the constitutive activity of the enhancer ( Fig .
2C , lanes 1 to 7 ) .
One region of the enhancer , positions -752 to -781 , contains one copy of the palindromic sequence GTGGACAATGTCC linked to the region comprising positions -761 to -783 .
However , this region has only 7 % of the R-induced activity of mutant pG2.752/ 899 , which contains both regions and upstream sequences .
There must be another RRE which compensates for the partial loss of positions -737 to -752 in mutant pG2.899/ 752 .
There is indeed a third region responding to R , localized VoL .
64 , 1990 between positions -812 and -899 , and the elements that mediate R activation in this region have yet to be character-ized .
Whether the RRE motif and the more remote putative RRE bind cellular factors or bind R or both remains to be established .
Since the enhancer has a weak but clear constitutive activity and this activity is reduced by progressive deletion of sequences , there must be cellular factors binding to this element .
Comparison of DNase I footprints by using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells and HeLa expressing R constitutively shows that there are constitutive and R-induced footprints covering the ORI , , , and BMLFI R-responsive enhancers ( H. Gruffat , unpublished results ) .
In conclusion , the R-responsive enhancer described above seems to fall in the multidomain enhancer family ( 15 ) and is probably composed of several basic elements , or enhansons , which are weak RREs ( 34 ) .
These enhansons have to be identified .
This must be done by characterization of protein-binding sites as well as by site-directed mutagenesis .
Using different EBV promoter-CAT constructs , others have reported that the DR/DL enhancer was in fact an EB1l-inducible enhancer with B-cell specificity ( 29 ) .
Indeed , these authors could detect the enhancer activity in EBV genome-positive IB4 cells only when EB1 was expressed .
This simply reflects the fact that R is induced by EB1 in EBV genome-positive cells ( 5 , 25 ) .
However , it should also be noted that EB1l and R induce EB2 ( the BMLFl ORF-encoded product ) in EBV genome-positive B cells .
EB2 is a posttranscriptional transactivator which very efficiently increases CAT enzyme activity without notably affecting the amount of CAT RNA expressed from different promoter-CAT chimeric genes ( 3 , 25 ) .
Therefore , experiments in which CAT enzyme activity is induced by EBl in EBV genome-positive cells have very little meaning and reflect additive ( maybe synergic ) transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects specific for CAT transcripts .
We have reported that the DR promoter RRE did not respond to EB1 in EBV genome-negative B cells but was instead induced by R ( 4 , 5 ) .
We also show in this paper that the R-inducible enhancer did not respond to EB1 in HeLa cells when positioned like an enhancer in a very general sense .
Moreover , at high R concentrations , the B-globin promoter ( this report ) and the BMLF1 promoter ( M. Buisson , personal communication ) were activated to saturation , and no additive effect of EB1 could be detected .
There is , however , an EBl-binding site ( ZRE-B ) located -843 bp upstream from the DR promoter initiation site in the region defined originally as the DR enhancer B domain ( 5 ) .
This ZRE-B did not confer a significant ( more than twofold ) EB1 responsiveness to the B-globin promoter , either alone or linked to the RRE , when localized over 500 bp from the B-globin cap site .
It is therefore not part of the enhancer .
However , EBl and R effects can be additive , when the amount of R is greatly reduced and when ZRE-B is positioned close to the TATA box .
This also turned out to be the case for the promoter controlling the expression of the BMLFl-encoded posttranscriptional activator EB2 .
The RRE is located at position -300 , and the EB1/APl/jun-fos-responsive element is located at position -100 .
However , there is synergy between EB1 and R on this promoter , since the effect observed is more than multiplicative , but only when the amount of R is greatly reduced ( M. Buisson , E. Manet , and A .
Sergeant , unpublished data ) .
The RRE is also clearly active on the EA-R promoter ( 11 ) in transient expression assays .
However , it remains to be established whether this enhancer influences transcription initiation from the DR promoter .
Our results indicate that in ORL , , ENHANCER TRANSACTIVATION 2817 HeLa cells , R by itself activates the DR promoter either linked to the IR4 gene or to the B-globin gene , but the level of activation is much lower than that observed with EB1 , and there is no synergy between EB1 and R. This is probably due to the fact that EB1 is the upstream factor for the DR promoter in HeLa cells .
Therefore , in the absence of EB1 , the DR promoter is almost restricted to the TATA box element , and R can not efficiently activate transcription when its responsive elements are localized far upstream from a TATA box alone ( N. Moreno and A .
Sergeant , unpublished data ) .
Accordingly , when the enhancer is localized close to the DR TATA box , it is strongly activated by R , and there is synergy between EB1 and R. Since EB1 is not an enhancer factor , why is there an EB1-binding site located in the R-responsive enhancer , -843 bp upstream of the DR promoter major initiation site ?
This EB1l-binding site is part of the EA-R promoter , which is an early promoter inducible by EB1 and by R , whose putative TATA box is located -970 bp upstream of the DL promoter cap site and in the rightward direction ( 18 ) .
Since the DL promoter and the DR promoter are homologous ( 26 ) and share the R-responsive enhancer , ZRE-B is probably conserved during the duplication of the two promoters .
One other explanation is that ZRE-B has a function in the activation of the origin of replication overlapping with the DR promoter .
