When such cells are precultured for 2 days with a low dose of LPS ( 20 ng/ml ) followed by stimulation with a high dose of LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) , expression of the TNF gene is minimal , i.e .
the cells are toler-ant .
In nuclear run-on analysis , such tolerant cells show only a low degree of transcription , indicating that tolerance operates at or upstream of the transcription level .
The CD14 LPS receptor is , however , up-regulated ( not down-regulated ) in tolerant cells , and LPS can , in fact , still lead to activation of tolerant cells as evidenced by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor « B ( NF- « B ) .
Resolution of the NF-KB complex in gel shift analysis shows that the binding protein , mobilized in naive Mono Mac 6 cells , consists mainly of p50-p65 heterodimers , while in tolerant cells , the p50 homodimer is predominant .
This increase in p50 homodimers coincides with an increase in p1l05 mRNA , suggestive of a transcriptional up-regulation of p50 .
Reporter gene analysis reveals that the NF- « B complex mobilized in tolerant cells is functionally inactive in that NF- « B-dependent luciferase constructs containing the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat or the TNF 5'-region show only minimal transactivation after LPS stimulation .
Similar to Mono Mac 6 cells , primary blood monocytes , when precultured with a low dose of LPS , also become tolerant and produce little TNF after LPS stimulation .
The tolerant blood monocytes also up-regulate CD14 , and they mobilize NF- « B with a predominance of p50 homodimers .
Taken together , these results demonstrate that tolerance to LPS is determined by post-receptor mechanisms *This work was supported by grants from the Wilhelm-Sander-Stiftung and Thyssen-Stiftung and by Deutsche Forschungsgemein-schaft SFB 217 .

Printed in U.S.A. that involve an altered composition of the NF- « B complex .
Repeated stimulation of cells can result in loss of responses , a process termed desensitization or tolerance .
Tolerance is typically observed for B-adrenergic drugs , which lose activity because their receptors disappear from the cell surface or because the receptors are uncoupled from the downstream signaling cascade ( 1 ) .
We have studied tolerance to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ' ; endotoxin ) , a cell wall constituent of Gram-negative bacteria that is a main activator in septic shock .
LPS acts through stimulation of monocytes , which respond with a rapid and transient production of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) .
Tolerance of monocytes/macrophages to stimulation by LPS has long been known from studies on pyrogenicity , antitumor activity , and cytokine production ( 2-5 ) , but the molecular mechanism has remained elusive .
We now show that receptor modulation or uncoupling is not involved .
Rather , in tolerant cells , the CD14 LPS receptor is up-regulated and can mediate mobilization of NF- « B .
The NF- « B complex , however , exhibits a predominance of the p50 homodimer , which lacks transactivation activity .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells-The cell line Mono Mac 6 ( 6 ) was cultured in 24-well plates at 2 x 10° % /ml in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % fetal calf serum and additives as described ( 6 ) .

Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 24 h. Gel Shift Analysis-Nuclear extracts were isolated according to Dig-nam et al .
( 11 ) and were admixed with a P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide representing the -605 NF-kB site of the human TNF promoter ( 12 ) .
Samples were then electrophoresed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels either in EMSA buffer ( 6.8 mm Tris-HCl , 3.4 mn sodium acetate , 1 mm EDTA , pH 8 ) or in 0.25 TBE buffer ( 22.5 my Tris borate , 0.5 mm EDTA , pH 8.5 ) .
Reporter Gene Analysis-Cells were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs ( 10 ug of DNA/10 `` cells ) according to Shakhov et al .
( 13 ) using DEAE-dextran ( 250 ug/ml ) .
Cells were then cultured for 2 days with or without LPS ( 20-50 ng/m1 ) , followed by LPS stimulation ( 1 ug/ml ) for 5-6 h. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined using a Model LB9501 luminometer ( Berthold , Wildbad , Germany ) .
Constructs employed contained the human TNF 5'-region PstW/Hgal fragment ( kindly provided by Dr. E. H. Weiss ) ( 14 ) , which was cloned into the pxP2 luciferase plasmid ( kindly provided by S. Nordeen ) ( 15 ) or the HIV LTR from HxB2 or its mutated version , which inactivates both NF- « B sites ( kindly provided by Nicole Israel ) ( 16 ) .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Tolerance to LPS : Effect on TNF and CD14-Cells of the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 produce high levels of TNF when stimulated with LPS ( Fig .
14 , second column ) .
However , when cells are pretreated for 2 days with low doses of LPS , the response to subsequent LPS stimulation is strongly reduced ( Fig .
14 , fourth column ) .
Northern blot analysis reveals that induction of TNF mRNA is only minimal in LPS-pre-treated cells ( Fig .
1B ) , which is due to reduced transcription of TNF mRNA as shown by nuclear run-on analysis ( Fig .
1C ) .
Tolerance to LPS is not restricted to TNF , but , as reported previously , expression of the cytokines interleukin-1 and -6 is also down-regulated upon repeated LPS stimulation ( 17 ) .
The classical mechanism of tolerance would call for the disappearance of LPS receptors from the cell surface .
While several LPS-binding proteins have been described to occur on monocytes , an involvement in LPS signaling has been demonstrated only for CD14 ( 18 , 19 ) .
The CD14 molecule is also expressed on Mono Mac 6 cells ( Fig .
24 , upper panel ) .
Tolerance induction by LPS does not decrease CD14 expression , but leads to a substantial increase in CD14-specific immunofluorescence staining ( Fig .
A B Ik 64 ch CD 14 ( My-4 ) Fic .

Effect of tolerance induction on expression of CD14 .
Mono Mac 6 cells were treated for 2 days with LPS ( 20 ng/ml ) .
A , cells were then analyzed for CD14 cell-surface expression by staining with antibody My4 ( right-hand curve ) or with isotype control .
10,000 cells were then recorded by flow cytometry .
Staining is given as mean specific fluorescence intensity in channels ( CH ) ( one of six experiments ) .
B , for Northern blot analysis , RNA was isolated from cells cultured for 2 days with and without LPS at 20 ng/ml .
Blots were probed with a P-labeled oligonucleotide specific for CD14 ( one of four experiments ) ( 35 ) .
2A , lower panel ) .
This effect is not due to transport of pre-formed protein to the cell surface , but appears to result from an increased biosynthesis since CD14 transcripts show a substantial increase in tolerant cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
Thus , the tolerance to LPS does not result from a disappearance of the LPS receptor .
Furthermore , the affinity of the LPS-CD14 interaction is only slightly reduced in tolerant Mono Mac 6 cells ( 20 ) .
The CD14 receptor may , however , be uncoupled from the downstream signal transduction pathways .
One essential component of the cytoplasmic/nuclear transduction pathway in the LPS response is the inducible transcription factor NF-kB ( 21 ) , a nuclear factor involved in transcriptional control of cytokine genes including TNF ( 12 , 13 ) .
NF-kB Protein and RNA-In human monocytes , nuclear NF- « B binding activity is present constitutively ( Fig .
34 ) , and LPS stimulation strongly increases DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts .

Mobilization of NF- « B and NF-kB mRNA in tolerant Mono Mac 6 cells .
Cells were pretreated with and without LPS ( LPS PRE . )
at 50 ng/ml for 2 days , followed by stimulation for 1 h with LPS ( LPS STIM . )
at 1 ug/ml .
Nuclear extracts were admixed with a P-labeled oligonucleotide representing the -605 NF-kB motif of the human TNF promoter .
A , electrophoresis was carried out in EMSA buffer .
The arrou denotes the specific NF- « B band ( one of six experiments ) .
B , electrophoresis was carried out in 0.25 m TBE buffer .
/ and II are specific binding proteins , and Z7 is nonspecific ( one of six experiments ) .
C , mRNA was isolated from Mono Mac 6 cells cultured for 2 days with and without LPS ( 20 ng/m !
1 ) , followed by stimulation with and without LPS at 1 ug/ml .
10 ug of RNAM/lane was hybridized with an oligonucleotide specific for p105 or p65 ( one of four experiments ) .
constitutive NF-KB activity , and LPS stimulation also results in rapid mobilization of NF-kB binding activity ( Fig .
3A ) ( 22 ) .
This strongly supports the notion that the LPS receptor is functional and not uncoupled from nuclear events .
When LPS-tolerant cells are challenged with other stimuli like phorbol esters , there is a similar mobilization of NF-kB , but no TNF transcription ( 22 ) , indicating that LPS tolerance is heterolo-gous and extends to other signals .
To achieve a better resolution of protein-DNA complexes , we used 0.25 x TBE buffer for native gel electrophoresis .
This allowed for the separation of two complexes , referred to as complexes I and II ( Fig .
3B ) .
Complex II co-migrates with the constitutive complex from K-562 cells overexpressing transfected NF- « B p50 subunit ; and an antiserum to p50 will super-shift complexes I and II , while an antiserum to p65 shifts only complex I ( data not shown ) ( 12 ) .
This confirms the previous conclusion ( 23-25 ) that complex I represents the p50-p65 het-erodimer ( products of NF- « B-1 and the re/A gene , respectively ) and that complex II represents a homodimer of the p50 subunit .
In these analyses , we did not detect additional bands suggestive of p65 homodimers .
In LPS-stimulated Mono Mac 6 cells , the p50-p65 complex is dominant ( Fig .
3B ) .
In contrast , LPS-tolerant cells stimulated with LPS show a predominance of the p50 homodimer ( Fig .
3B ) .
Densitometric analysis gives an average ratio of p50-p65 to p50 homodimer of 1.4 + 0.2 , while in tolerant cells , this ratio is lowered to 0.8 + 0.1 ( n = 6 ) .
Mobilization of NF-kB in both naive and LPS-tolerant cells can be blocked by treatment with the My4 antibody ( data not shown ) , indicating that CD14 is the essential receptor in this system .
The increase in p50 homodimer DNA binding activity may be due to new synthesis of p50 protein from its precursor , p105 .
We observed that p105 mRNA levels are up-regulated upon stimulation of Mono Mac 6 cells with LPS , while p65 mRNA levels are unaffected ( Fig .
3B ) .
Tolerant cells show an increased level of p105 mRNA , which is further augmented upon secondary LPS treatment .
This may allow for increased translation of p105 and its increased processing to p50 protein .
The p50 homodimer is known to translocate independently to the nucleus , to escape inhibition of IKb- « , and to down-regulate transcription from NF- « B sites ( 25 , 26 ) .
Reporter Gene Analysis-To test whether the altered NF- « B composition affects gene expression , we transfected NF- « B-dependent HIV-1 LTR reporter gene constructs , followed by preculture with or without LPS and by measurement of luciferase activity .
LPS stimulation of Mono Mac 6 cells induces a 6-fold enhancement of LTR activity , while a construct with mutations in both NF- « B sites shows no or only minimally increased reporter gene expression ( 1.5-fold ) ( Fig .
4A ) .
When LPS-tolerant Mono Mac 6 cells are tested , LPS stimulation does not increase transactivation of the NF- « B-dependent HIV-1 LTR reporter gene ( Fig .
4B ) .
This indicates that the composition of NF- « B complexes mobilized in LPS-tolerant cells is functionally inac-tive .
This also applies to transcription of the NF- « B-dependent TNF gene .
Using a TNF promoter-controlled luciferase reporter construct , we observed that LPS-responsive Mono Mac 6 cells induce a strong transactivation , while LPS-tolerant cells show only a minimal response ( Fig .
4C ) .
Hence , it appears that p50 induced by LPS tolerance lacks transactivation activity and instead occupies the cognate NF- « B-binding site and prevents transactivation by the p50-p65 complex .
This notion is supported by transfection studies with Mono Mac 6 cells in which cotransfection of the p50 expression plasmid with the TNF promoter gene construct led to reduced constitutive and LPS-in-duced reporter gene activity ( data not shown ) .
A similar negative effect of p50 has been reported previously for the interleukin-2 promoter and the HIV LTR in that overexpression of p50 results in repression of responses ( 25 , 27 ) .
Tolerance in Primary Monocytes-When looking at primary human blood monocytes precultured with LPS , we also observed a down-regulation of TNF production and an up-regulation of or no change in cell-surface CD14 ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , LPS stimulation of naive cells gives a predominance of p50-p65 over p50 homodimers ( ratio of 1.8 + 0.6 ) , while stimulation of LPS-tolerant blood monocytes is associated with a relative increase in the p50 homodimer ( ratio of 0.8 + 0.1 , n = 3 ) .
Thus , mechanisms similar to those described herein for Mono Mac 6 may also operate in primary blood monocytes .
Concluding Remarks-Earlier studies have shown that NF- « B itself may participate in the regulation of p105 expression through NF- « B motifs in the p105 promoter ( 28 , 29 ) , while 17004 LPS pre .

Functional activity of NF- « B in untreated and tolerant Mono Mac 6 cells , A-C , cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids , followed by 2-day culture with and without LPS ( 20 ng/ml ) and stimulation by LPS ( 1 ug/ml ) for 5-6 h before assay of luciferase activity in cell lysates .
Promoter fragments were the HIV LTR from HxB2 and its mutated version , which inactivates both NF- « B sites or the PstU/Hgal fragment ( 1084 base pairs ) of the human ( Hu ) TNF 5'-region .
Data represent fold transactivation by LPS stimulation in cells without and with LPS preculture ( LPS pre . )
at 20 ng of LPS/ml ( mean + S.D .
, n = 6 , 5 , and 3 for A-C , respectively .
the p65 promoter does not contain such a motif ( 30 ) .
Since tolerant cells are still able to respond to LPS with enhanced transcription of p105 ( while transcription of TNF is blocked ) , it appears that in the p105 promoter , p50 may have transactivation activity , similar to what has been reported for major his-tocompatibility complex class I expression ( 31 , 32 ) .
This transactivation by p50 may be subject to control by Bel-3 ( 33 , 34 ) .
Our study shows that LPS-tolerant cells can still be activated by LPS to mobilize NF- « B DNA-binding proteins .
This NF- « B complex , due to a predominance of p50 , will not transactivate the TNF promoter .
This novel mechanism of down-regulation of gene expression in monocytes may apply to other NF- « B-dependent cytokines and receptors and to viruses like HIV .
Thus , the up-regulation of NF- « B p50 could offer a general approach to control diseases that involve activation of monocytes and macrophages .
