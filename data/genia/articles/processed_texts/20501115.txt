Robert A. Kirken , `` `` * `` Rebecca A. Erwin , `` ** Lihua Wang , * Yuling Wang , * Hallgeir Rui , `` and William L. Farrar* Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) transforms cytokine-dependent T lymphocytes and causes adult T cell leukemia .
Janus tyrosine kinase ( Jak ) 3 and transcription factors StatSa and StatS5b are essential for the proliferation of normal T cells and are constitutively hyperactivated in both HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines and lymphocytes isolated from HTLV-1-infected patients ; therefore , a critical role for the Jak3-Stat5 pathway in the progression of this disease has been postulated .
We recently reported that tyrphostin AG-490 selectively blocked IL-2 activation of Jak3/Stat5 and growth of murine T cell lines .
Here we demonstrate that disruption of Jak3/StatS5a/b signaling with AG-490 ( 50 mM ) blocked the proliferation of primary human T lymphocytes , but paradoxically failed to inhibit the proliferation of HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines , HuT-102 and MT-2 .
Structural homologues of AG-490 also inhibited the proliferation of primary human T cells , but not HTLV-1-infected cells .
Disruption of constitutive Jak3/Stat5 activation by AG-490 was demonstrated by inhibition of 1 ) tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 , StatSa and StatSb ( Tyr® `` `` ) ; 2 ) serine phosphorylation of Stat5a ( Ser'** ) as determined by a novel phosphospecific Ab ; and 3 ) StatSa/b DNA binding to the Stat5-responsive B-casein promoter .
In contrast , AG-490 had no effect on DNA binding by p50/p65 components of a transcription factor activated by the HTLV-1-encoded phosphoprotein , Tax .
Collectively , these data suggest that the Jak3-Stat5 pathway in HTLV-1-transformed T cells has become functionally redundant for proliferation .
Reversal of this functional uncoupling may be required before Jak3/Stat5 inhibitors will be useful in the treatment of this malignancy .
- The Journal of Immunology , 2000 , 165 : 5097-5104. uman T cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-1 ) * is a ret- rovirus that serves as the etiological agent for adult T cell leukemia , an aggressive and frequently fatal malignancy ( 1-3 ) .
In vitro studies have demonstrated that the virus dramatically alters T lymphocyte growth patterns ( 4 ) , while infected patients generally display clonal expansion of CD4 * ( 5 , 6 ) and CD8 * T lymphocytes ( 7 ) .
HTLV-1-mediated transformation or transition from a cytokine-dependent to an independent phase of growth has been attributed to Tax , a 40-kDa regulatory phosphoprotein encoded by the HTLV-1 virus ( 8-11 ) .
Tax has been shown to induce the transcription of several genes involved in promoting cell growth by enhancing degradation of IxB-a and IxB-f3 , thereby *Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology , University of Texas Health Science Center , Houston , TX 77030 ; *IRSP , Science Applications International Corporation Frederick , and *Division of Basic Sciences , Cytokine Molecular Mechanisms Section , Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation , National Cancer Institute , Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , Frederick , MD 21702 ; and Department of Pathology , Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences , Be-thesda , MD 20814 Received for publication September 7 , 1999 .

9 ; for review , see Ref .
18 ) .
Recent evidence suggests that HTLV-1 may also promote constitutive activation of a family of cytokine-activated signaling proteins known as Janus tyrosine kinases ( Jaks ) and Stat transcription factors .
Under normal conditions , polypeptide hormones and cytokines induce transient tyrosine phosphorylation of these latent signaling molecules .
Current models hold that oligomerization of the receptor complex by growth factors results in autophosphorylation and activation of Jaks , which , in turn , phosphorylate tyrosine residues located within the cytoplasmic tail of these receptors so that Stats are transiently recruited via their Sre homology 2 domains ( 19 ) .
Subsequently , Jak enzymes catalyze Stat tyrosine phosphorylation , facilitating their dimerization and disengagement from the receptor complex upon which they migrate to the nucleus , bind select promoter elements , and ultimately regulate cell growth and differentiation ( 19 ) .
Serine kinases also regulate Stat protein activity .
Specifically , serine residue $ 727 of Statla and Stat3 constitutes a major phosphorylation site and is important for IFN-induced nuclear translocation , DNA binding , and maximal transcriptional activation ( 20-22 ) .
We recently reported that Stata and Stat5b become phosphorylated on serine residues following activation of lymphocytes by prolactin or IL-2 ( 23 , 24 ) .
We subsequently mapped these sites to $ 726 in StatSa and S731 in Stat5b ( 25 ) .
In T and B lymphocytes Stat5a/b are activated by the lym-phocyte-restricted enzyme , Jak3 .
Jak3 is exclusively activated by the cytokines that use the common IL-2R chain ( y , ) and include IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , IL-13 , and IL-15 ( 19 , 26-29 ) .

Moreover , activation of StatSa and Stat5b has been determined to be unconditionally required for IL-2-mediated T cell proliferation based upon gene deletion experiments ( 30 ) .
Whereas Jak and Stat proteins are normally unphosphorylated and inactive in quiescent lymphocytes , HTLV-1-transformed cells , including HuT-102 and MT-2 , typically show constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 and Stats ( 31-33 ) .
Similarly , lymphocytes obtained from HTLV-1-infected patients display hypertyr-osine-phosphorylated Jak3 , Stat5 , and Stat3 , but not Jak2 , Jak1 , or Tyk-2 ( 34 ) .
Constitutively active Jak and Stat proteins are also commonly observed in a number of other malignancies , including Src- , v-Abl- , and EBV-transformed cell lines and patient lymphocytes ( 35-41 ) .
However , a causal relationship between malignant growth has not been established , nor is it clear whether disruption of this Jak/Stat signaling pathway will reverse the phenotypic condition .
We have recently reported that tyrphostin AG-490 , a derivative of benzylidine malononitrile that resembles erbstatin moieties , is a potent inhibitor of the Jak3/Stat5 signaling pathway in human and murine T cells ( 42-45 ) .
While this drug also has been shown to have effects on Jak2 , it fails to inhibit Jak1 , Tyk2 , or a series of tyrosine kinases expressed in lymphocytes , including Lck , Lyn , Bik , Syk , Src , and Zap70 ( 43 , 46 ) .
The studies described in this report were aimed at investigating whether AG-490 could preferentially inhibit constitutive and cytokine-induced activation of the Jak3/Stat5 signaling cascade within HTLV-1-transformed human T cells and subsequently disrupt malignant cell growth .
Materials and Methods Cell culture and treatment Freshly explanted human T lymphocytes were obtained from normal do-mors , purified by isocentrifugation , and activated for 72 h with 1 pg/ml PHA in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FCS ( catalogue no .
F2442 , Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , and penicillin-streptomycin ( 50 IU/ml and 50 pg/ml , respectively ) .
MT-2 and HuT-102 HTLV-1-infected cell lines were maintained in the above medium without PHA .
T lymphocytes were made quiescent by washing and incubating for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 % FCS before exposure to cytokines .
Cells were treated with varying concentrations of AG-490 ( catalogue no .
658401 , Cal-biochem , San Diego , CA ) for 16 h as described in the figure legends .
Cells were then stimulated with 100 nM human rIL-2 ( Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley , NJ ) , TNF-a , or IL-15 ( PeproTech , Rock Hill , NJ ) at 37°C as indicated in the corresponding figure legends .
Cell pellets were frozen at -70°C .
Proliferation assays Quiescent T , MT-2 , and HuT-102 cells ( 5 X 10*/well ) were plated in flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates in 200 ul of growth medium ( de-scribed above ) with 1 % FCS .
Cells were treated for 16 h with AG-490 or tyrphostin A25 , B44 , B46 , B48 , or B50 ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) as described above , pulsed for the remaining 4 h of the assay with [ °H [ Jthy-midine ( 0.5 wCi/200 pl ) , and harvested onto glass-fiber filters .
[ °H ] Thymidine incorporation was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting ( 43 ) .
Solubilization of membrane proteins and immunoprecipitation Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and solubilized in lysis buffer ( 10° cells/ml ! )
containing 10 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.6 ) , 5 mM EDTA , 50 mM NaCl , 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 50 mM sodium fluoride , 1 mM sodium ortho-vanadate , 1 % Triton X-100 , 1 mM PMSF , 5 ug/ml aprotinin , 1 ug/ml pepstatin A , and 2 pg/ml leupeptin .
Cell lysates were rotated end-over-end at 4°C for 60 min , and insoluble material was pelleted at 12,000 X g for 20 min .
Depending on the experiment , supernatants were incubated with 5 pg/ml polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against carboxyl1- terminal peptides corresponding to StatSa ( LDARLSPPAGLFTSARSSLS ) or StatSb MDSQWIPHAQS ) .
Site-specific anti-Stat5 phosphoserine Abs were similarly produced to the corresponding phosphopeptide sequence DQAP [ pSJPAVC , and all peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet he-mocyanin and used as immunogens in rabbits ( 25 ) .
Rabbit anti-Jak3 was prepared as previously described ( 28 ) , and anti-phosphotyrosine or antiphosphotyrosine StatSa/b ( ¥694/699 ) mAbs were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology ( Lake Placid , NY ; catalogue no .
05-321 and 05-495 , respectively ) .
Abs were captured by incubation for 45 min with protein A-Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) .
Precipitated material was eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer for 4 min and was subjected to 7.5 % SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions .
All proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( catalogue no .
1PVHO0010 , Immo-bilon , Millipore , Bedford , MA ) .
All Western blots used the above described Abs diluted 1/1000 in blocking buffer for 1 h , while phosphoserine Stat5 Abs were blotted at 1/5000 for 20 h at room temperature .
EMSA AG-490-treated and control ( DMSO-treated ) cells were pelleted by centrifugation ( 20,000 X g for 1 min at 4°C ) and subsequently washed in 5 vol of 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 10 mM KCI , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.5 mM DTT , 100 mM PMSF , 5 pg/ml aprotinin , 1 ug/ml pepstatin A , and 2 pg/ml leupeptin ; centrifuged ; then lysed in the same buffer supplemented with 1 % Nonidet P-40 and incubated for 20 min on ice .
The nuclei-containing pellet was resuspended in equal volumes of low salt buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 25 % glycerol , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 20 mM KCI , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.2 mM EDTA , and protease inhibitors ) and high salt buffer ( low salt buffer containing 800 mM KC ] .
This fraction was then isolated by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min , and supernatants were saved as nuclear protein extract and stored at -70°C .
Gel mobility shift assays were performed to detect Stat5a/b DNA binding activity using a Stats DNA binding sequence corresponding to the promoter of the B-casein gene ( 5'-AGATTITCTAGGAATTCAATCC-3 ' ) or an NF- « B binding element Both probes were end labeled with [ °°P ] dATP .
Labeled oligonucleotides were then incubated with 5 pug of nuclear-extracted proteins in 15 pl of binding cocktail ( 50 mM Tris-CI ( pH 7.4 ) , 25 mM MgCl , , 5 mM DTT , and 50 % glycerol ) at 4°C for 2 h. For supershift assays , nuclear extracts were preincubated with 1 pg of either normal rabbit serum or antiserum specific to Stat5a , Stat5b , or p50/p65 NF-KB ( catalogue no .
sc-1190X and sc-372X , respectively , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) as indicated in the figure legends at 4°C for 1 h , then incubated with **P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide for 15 min at room temperature .
The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5 % polyacrylamide gels containing 0.25 % TBE , which were prerun in 0.25 % TBE buffer for 1 h at 100 V. Samples were loaded , and gels were run at room temperature for approximately 2 h at 150 V , then dried by heating under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film ( X-OMAT , Eastman Kodak , Rochester , NY ) at -70°C .
Results AG-490 blocks constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 and Stat5a/b isolated from HTLV-1-transformed human T cells Previously we had established that 75 wM of the Jak3 inhibitor AG-490 potently inhibited IL-2-induced cell growth of the murine T cell clone , D10 ( 42 ) .
We next wanted to assess whether AG-490 also could block activation of Jak3/StatSa/b in HTLV-1-transformed HuT-102 and MT-2 cells that display constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of both proteins .
For this analysis actively growing HuT-102 and MT-2 cells were equally distributed and cultured with the drug for 16 h , then stimulated in the absence or the presence of IL-2 for 10 min .
Jak3 and Stat5a/b were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and subsequently blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine Abs ( 4G10 ) or anti-phosphotyrosine Stat5 ( Y¥694/699 ) , respectively ( Fig .
1 ) .
Whereas each of the three signaling molecules displayed constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation in MT-2 ( Fig .
14 ) and HuT-102 ( Fig .
1B ) cells ( Janes a , e , and i ) , AG-490 potently inhibited basal and noncytokine-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 ( Zanes c and d ) and constitutive and IL-2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of StatSa/b ( lanes g , A , k , and F ) in both cell lines .

AG-490 inhibits constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 and tyrosine/serine phosphorylation of Stat5a/b in HTLV-1-transformed T cells .
MT-2 cells ( 4 ) or Hut-102 cells ( B ) were pretreated with DMSO ( control ) or 75 M AG-490 for 16 h and then stimulated for 10 min with ( + ) or without ( - ) 100 nM IL-2 for 10 min at 37°C .
Cells were lysed and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak3 ( Zanes a-d ) , blotted with antiphosphotyrosine , stripped , and reprobed with polyclonal Jak3 Abs .
Alternatively , lysates were immunoprecipitated with StatSa ( Janes e-A ) or Stat5b ( lanes i-1 ) , blotted with monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine Stat5 , polyclonal phosphoserine Stat5 ( $ 726-StatSa or $ 731 Stat5b ) , and reblotted with monoclonal pan Stat5 .
Densi-tometry and normalization of Jak3 samples isolated from DMSO-treated compared with AG-490-treated cells showed decreased constitutive ( without IL-2 ) tyrosine phosphorylation for MT-2 of 64 % ( A , lane a , of 0.671 relative absorbance units ( rau ) , Zane b of 0.803 rau , lane c of 0.239 rau , and lane d of 0.460 rau ) and for Hut-102 of 71 % ( B , lane a of 0.825 rau , lane b of 0.608 rau , lane c of 0.240 rau , and lane d of 0.265 rau ) .
protein were inhibited by 64 and 71 % for MT-2 and HuT-102 cells , respectively , while Stat5a/b showed a corresponding loss of phosphorylation signal ( data not shown ) .
HTLV-1 transformed T cells display constitutive serine-phosphorylated StatSa ( S726 ) and Stat5Sb ( S731 ) that can be inhibited by AG-490 Statl a and Stat3 are serine phosphorylated at residue $ 727 , which is important for IFN-induced nuclear translocation , DNA binding , and maximal transcriptional activation ( 20-22 ) .
This site is located within a consensus PXSP phosphoacceptor site for mitogen-activated protein kinase ( 47 , 48 ) .
Recent work by Zhang et al .
( 49 ) reported that phosphorylated $ 727 was also required for interaction with minichromosomal maintenance protein 5 and was necessary for maximum transcriptional activity and possibly cell cycle progression .
Interestingly , IL-2 also inducibly regulates serine phosphorylation of StatSa and Stat5b , and we have mapped this site to a serine residue of a PSP motif found in StatSa and StatSb ( 23 , 25 ) .
To specifically analyze the phosphorylation status of this motif in StatSa ( 8726 ) and StatS5b ( S731 ) in HTLV-1-transformed cells , blots in Fig .
1 were next probed with site-specific phosphoserine Abs directed to phosphorylated peptide corresponding to aa residues 721-729 of human StatSa or 726-734 of human StatSb .
Stat5a/b isolated from quiescent PHA-activated human T cells display serine phosphorylation of this site only upon IL-2 stimulation ( data not shown ) .
As depicted in Fig .
1 , HuT-102 and MT-2 cells primarily displayed constitutively serine phosphorylation of StatSa ( lanes e and f ) , but not Stat5b ( lanes i and j ) .
AG-490 treatment significantly reduced StatSa $ 726 phosphorylation without affecting total StatSa protein levels ( Zanes g and A ) .
AG-490 disrupts basal and IL-15-inducible Jak3 , Stat5a , and Stat5b tyrosine phosphorylation It has been previously reported that HuT-102 produces high levels of the IL-15 mRNA transcript , in contrast to nearly undetectable levels in resting or activated T cells ( 50 ) .
Bamford et al .
( 51 ) found that the R region , corresponding to the long terminal repeat of HTLV-1 , is fused with the IL-15 transcript via the 5 ' end of the untranslated region , driving its transcription and possibly promoting cell proliferation via an autocrine regulated loop .
IL-15 , like IL-2 , uses the IL-2RB and y_-chains to activate Jak3 and Stat5 ; thus , we investigated whether AG-490 could also disrupt stimulation of Jak3/StatSa/b by exogenously added IL-15 in these cells .
As shown in Fig .
2 ( upper panel ) , IL-15 increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of StatSa ( lanes e and f ) and StatSb ( lanes i and J ) over basal levels , but not that of Jak3 ( lanes a and b ) .
Again , pretreatment of HuT-102 cells with AG-490 ( 75 uM ) completely abolished basal and IL-15-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of all three signaling proteins ( Zanes c , d , g , A , k , and / ) .
Normalization of Jak3 and StatSa/b phosphotyrosine levels compared with total protein indicated > 70 % loss of phosphorylation signal ( data not shown ) .

To test the idea that AG490 inhibits the generation of transcriptionally competent Stat5a/b , gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to assess their ability to bind to an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the Stat5 binding element of the B-casein gene promoter .
Nuclear extracts isolated from tyrphostin-treated HuT-102 , MT-2 , or PHA-activated human T cells were harvested from samples identical with those depicted in Fig .
1 and incubated with °°P-labeled B-casein probe in the absence or the presence of specific Stat5a/b antisera ( Fig .

Extracts from IL-2-stimulated cells treated overnight with DMSO displayed a weakly inducible , single DNA binding complex that could be supershifted with anti-Stat5a ( lane c ) , partially with anti-Stat5b ( lane d ) , or completely with both StatSa and StatSb Abs ( lane e ) , but not with normal rabbit sera alone ( lane f ) .
To determine whether all transcription factors were equally inhibited by AG-490 in HTLV-1-transformed cells , the non-Jak3-activating pathway , TNF-a , was examined .

Next , 5 ug of nuclear cell extract from each sample set was incubated with the NF- « B DNA binding element and supershifted with the appropriate Ab to confirm the identity of the p50/p65 complex .
AG-490 was not effective at inhibiting constitutive or cytokine-inducible NF-kB DNA binding activity ( Fig .

AG-490 blocks IL-2-mediated growth of mitogen-activated human T cells , but not HTLV-1-transformed cells Since the Jak3/Stat5 pathway is known to promote T cell growth , we next tested whether AG-490 could effectively block leukemic cell growth of HTLV-1-transformed cells ( 26 , 30 ) .
Previously studies indicated that T cells treated with AG-490 were > 90 % viable , and inhibition of IL-2-inducible cell proliferation was recoverable ( 43 ) .
For these experiments , actively growing PHA-activated T cells , HuT-102 , or MT-2 cells were cocultured with increasing concentrations of drug for a period of 16 h and assayed FIGURE 3 .

AG-490 completely abolished IL-2-inducible [ °H ] thymidine incorporation into PHA-activated human T cells ( top panel ) at 50 wM , displaying a 50 % inhibitory concentration of approximately 20 wM while having no effect on either HuT-102 or MT-2 cells , even at concentrations as high as 100 uM .
In fact , we consistently observed enhanced thy-midine uptake in HTLV-1-transformed cells treated with this tyr-phostin , particularly HuT-102 .
Thus , while AG-490 potently inhibited basal and cytokine-induced Jak3/Stat5a/b tyrosine phosphorylation and Stat5a/b DNA binding , it failed to block malignant cell growth of HTLV-1-transformed cell lines .
AG-490 belongs to a family of relatively uncharacterized tyrosine kinase inhibitors , originally derived from benzylidine mal-ononitrile , that structurally mimic tyrosine and ATP moieties ( 44 , 45 ) .
We identified five tyrphostins that were able to potently inhibit IL-2 stimulation of Jak3 tyrosine phosphorylation in human T cells ( data not shown ) .
Their specificity was not studied further ; however , they were each tested for their ability to inhibit [ °H ] thymidine uptake of HTLV-1-transformed and PHA-activated human T cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
For this analysis , all cells were treated with 100 uM of the indicated drug for 16 h at 37°C .
In addition to AG-490 , all five tyrphostins , including A25 , B44 , B46 , B48 , and B50 , potently inhibited primary T cell growth ; however , these agents had little effect on HTLV-1-transformed cells .
Only B46 showed moderate inhibitory activity in Hut-102 cells ( ~40 % ) , but this effect was not observed in MT-2 cells .
Interestingly , the leukemic human NK cell line YT , which expresses Jak3 but is not HTLV-1 transformed , displayed a drug sensitivity similar to that of PHA-activated human T cells ( data not shown ) .
This evidence demonstrates that HTLV-1-transformed cells are resistant to a series of tyrphostins and suggests that HTLV-1 leukemogenesis is not dependent on Jak2/Jak3/Stat5 activity .

DMSO Discussion In the present study we provide evidence that AG-490 blocks constitutive and IL-2/IL-15-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 and Stat5a/b isolated from HTLV-1-transformed MT-2 and HuT-102 cell lines ( Fig .
1 ) .
We also provide the first account that HTLV-1-transformed cells display constitutive serine-phosphory-lated StatSa ( S726 ) , but not StatSb , and that this kinase was efficiently blocked by AG-490 , most likely via inhibition of its far upstream activator , Jak3 ( Fig .
1 ) .
EMSA analysis further verified that DNA binding of partially purified StatSa/b harvested from actively growing or cytokine-stimulated MT-2 or HuT-102 cells was significantly inhibited following AG-490 treatment ( Fig .
3 ) .
However , this drug had no overt effect on constitutive NF- « B DNA binding activity isolated from similarly treated cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
Inhibition of the Jak3/StatSa/b signaling pathway by AG-490 failed to disrupt leukemic growth of HTLV-1-transformed cells .
Similarly , several other potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors were competent to block basal and IL-2-stimulated cell growth of mitogen-activated lymphocytes , but had no effect on HTLV-1-transformed cells ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) .
Jak and Stat proteins have received much attention as putative targets for controlling leukemogenesis .
Indeed , constitutively activated Jak and Stat proteins have been identified and studied in several distinct oncogenic models , including a leukemia-like phenotype in Drosophila ( 52 ) , B cell Ag receptor-Abl-expressing cell lines and patient peripheral lymphocytes ( 40 ) , acute myeloid leukemia blasts ( 53 ) , B lymphocytes obtained from patients afflicted with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( 54 ) , EBV-infected ( 41 ) , and src-transformed cells ( 35-39 ) .
The explanation of how the HTLV-1 virus transforms T cells to a state of growth factor independence is not readily apparent .
However , it is known that 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 5102 HTLV-1 TRANSFORMATION DOES NOT REQUIRE JAK3/STATS5 PATHWAY 1200004 T Cells 100000-800004 s00004 400004 200004 o 0 2 & 5 5 40 25 50 75 100 HuT-102 0 25 5 do as 50 750 100 MT-2 50004 [ BH ] -Thymidine Incorporation ( cpm ) 4000 4 3000 4 2000 4 1000 4 0 25 s 10 250 50 75 100 Tyrphostin AG-490 ( uM ) FIGURE 5 .
AG-490 inhibits IL-2-induced proliferation of T cells in a dose-dependent manner , but not HTLV-1-transformed HuT-102 or MT-2 cell lines .
Top panel , Cell proliferation of PHA-activated , quiescent T cells ( 5 X 10*/well ) was examined following treatment with increasing concentrations of AG-490 ( ordinate ) for 16 h at 37°C in the presence of 1 nM IL-2 , except for the sample represented by the first bar .
Similarly , HuT-102 ( middle panel ) and MT-2 cells ( bottom panel ) were treated with DMSO or AG-490 as indicated .
All cells were then pulsed with [ °H ] thymidine ( 0.5 Ci/200 pul ) for 4 h , and incorporation of radiolabel is plotted on the abscissa , expressed as total counts per minute .
Error bars represent the SEM ( n = 6 ) .
infected T cell cultures become IL-2 independent over time , which parallels acquisition of constitutively active Jak3 , but not Jak2 , Jak1 , or Tyk2 ( 34 ) .
Moreover , lymphocytes obtained from HTLV-l-infected patients display constitutively active Stat proteins , which also correlates with enhanced Jak3 activity ( 30 ) .
Since Jak3 is only recruited and activated by T cell growth factors that use y , , , autocrine-regulated growth by one or more of these cytokines has been proposed ( 34 ) .
An autocrine-regulated loop for IL-2 or IL-15 was mostly dispelled , since coculturing cells with respective Abs failed to disrupt malignant cell growth or tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak and Stat proteins ; however , other Jak3-activating cytokines ( e.g .
, IL-4 or IL-7 ) could not be excluded ( 34 ) .
Here we provide evidence that AG-490 potently inhibits constitutive Jak3 activity .
Previously we reported that this tyrphostin selectively inhibits IL-2-induced autophosphorylation of Jak3 following in vivo or direct in vitro treatment ( 43 ) .
Moreover , stimulation of Jak3 by the other y. cytokines ( IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , and IL-15 ) was profoundly blocked at concentrations of AG-490 similar to those used here ( 43 ) .
Since proliferation assays failed to detect any disruption in cell growth of MT-2 or HuT-102 following treatment with AG-490 ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) , we conclude that Jak3-mediated pathways are unlikely to perpetuate HTLV-1 malignancy .
However , it remains to be determined whether the cycle of HTLV-1 leukemogenesis may prove susceptible to Jak3 inhibitors during the immortalization phase ( ligand dependent ) , before transformation ( ligand independent ) , where cumulative genetic errors are likely to be manifested as neoplastic T cell growth .
While HTLV-1-mediated IL-2 independence requires a 6- to 12-mo latency period ( 8-11 ) , we observed that pretreatment of mitogen-activated or unactivated T cells with 25000 T Cells 30000 25000 20000 15000 10000 5000 `` a= 0- + + + [ 3 ] 112 : ~ 100548 ~ mo tic tz a .

- Various tyrosine kinase inhibitors ablate cell growth of mitogen-activated T cells but not HuT-102 or MT-2 cells .
Top panel , Proliferation of PHA-activated , quiescent T cells ( 5 X 10*/well ) was examined following treatment with tyrphostin-derived tyrosine kinase inhibitors .
PHA-activated human T cells , HuT-102 cells , and MT-2 cells were treated with 100 M AG-490 , A25 , B44 , B46 , B48 , or B50 for 16 h at 37°C ( ordinate ) .
All cells were then pulsed with [ °HJthymidine ( 0.5 Ci/200 pl ) for 4 h , and incorporation of radiolabeled probe is plotted on the abscissa , expressed as total counts per minute .
Error bars represent the SEM ( n = 6 ) .
varying concentrations of AG-490 resulted in T cell death after 5-7 days ( data not shown ) .
Thus , ablation of all anti-apoptotic T cell growth factors that signal via Jak3 does not make such an analysis readily addressable .
Can HTLV-1 promote oncogenesis by non-Jak tyrosine kinases ?
A recent report found that human T cells transformed by herpesvirus saimiri display constitutively activated Zap70 and p56 `` * , but not Jak or Stat proteins ( 55 , 56 ) .
Upon further investigation , we failed to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of either protein in MT-2 or HuT-102 cells ( data not shown ) .
However , several of the more broadly based tyrphostins ( A25 , B44 , B46 , B48 , and B50 ) , which also inhibited Jak3 ( R. A. Kirken , unpublished observation ) might be expected to have an effect on the hyperactivation of additional tyrosine kinases .
Nonetheless , all five agents blocked both basal and IL-2-induced proliferation of PHA-activated T cells , while only B46 showed moderate inhibition ( ~40 % ) at 100-uM concentrations of drug in HuT-102 cells ; however , this response was 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology not observed for MT-2 cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
From this evidence we conclude that tyrosine kinases in general may not play a predominant role in the leukemogenesis of these cells .
The 40-kDa phosphoprotein Tax does not bind directly to DNA ; however , it is responsible for driving the trans-activation and transcription of several proliferative genes in addition to HTLV-1 , presumably by interacting with a variety of protein factors , including CREB/ATF binding proteins , p67°~ `` , and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 `` ¢*** , allowing for cyclin-dependent kinase-4 activation and activation of NF- « B ( 18 ) .
NF- « B is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm of resting T lymphocytes ; however ; Tax stimulates the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB-a and via two conserved serine residues that allow transcriptionally active NF-KB to translocate to the nucleus and promote expression of IL-2 and IL-2R a-chain ( 14 ) , c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogenes ( 15 ) , and Stat5 ( 16 ) .
It is of interest to note that these signaling pathways are predominantly dependent on serine-threo-nine , and not tyrosine kinase , activity .
As stated above , several tyrosine kinase inhibitors failed to block the growth of HTLV-1-transformed cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
Despite potent inhibition of StatSa/b DNA binding by AG-490 , there was no loss of constitutive NF- « B DNA binding activity ( Figs .
3 and 4 ) .
Taken together , it seems likely that therapeutic approaches aimed at ablating Tax/serine-threonine kinase signaling molecules may hold greater potential for treating this disease .
Whether similar observations and conclusions will be encountered for other leukemic malignancies displaying hyperphosphorylated Jak and Stat signaling proteins remains to be determined .
