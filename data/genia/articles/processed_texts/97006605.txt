Cell hemoglobinization was accompanied by the increased expression of genes encoding y-globin and porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBGD ) , an enzyme of heme synthesis .
By using run-on assays , ACLA was shown to induce an enhancement of the transcription of erythroid genes , including y-globin , PBGD , erythropoietin receptor , and GATA-1 transcription factor .
In contrast , in DOX-treated cells , the transcription rate of these genes was unchanged in comparison with control cells .
In addition , inhibition of mRNA synthesis with actinomycin D indicated that DOX induced an increased stability of PBGD and GATA-1 mRNAs , whereas ACLA did not affect the half-lives of these mRNAs .
Because the increase in erythroid mRNA steady-state level in anthracycline-treated cells was inhibited by cycloheximide , this suggests that transcriptional activation in ACLA-treated cells and mRNA stabilization in DOX-treated cells were dependent on de novo protein synthesis .
Finally , GATA-1 protein level was shown to be increased in ACLA-treated but not in DOX-treated cells .
These two anthracyclines , although closely related in their structures , appeared to act as differentiation inducers by distinct mechanisms .
Indeed , erythroid gene expression was demonstrated to be regulated transcriptionally by ACLA and mainly posttranscriptionally by DOX .

Introduction Because malignant cells are blocked in their normal maturation , the induction of differentiation of tumor cells may provide an alternative or support to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy of cancer ( 1-3 ) .
In this respect , numerous studies in vitro and in vivo have been undertaken using a broad range of chemical differentiating agents , including retinoic acid ( 4-6 ) , butyrate derivatives ( 7 ) , DMSO ( 4 ) , and anthracyclines ( 8 ) .
Among these models , the best characterized is probably the all-trans-retinoic acid-mediated differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia , both at experimental and clinical levels ( 5 , 6 ) .
Anthracycline antitumor antibiotics such as ACLA® and DOX are widely used in conventional cancer chemotherapy , and their cytotoxic effects are commonly accepted to be due to DNA intercalation ( 9 ) and interaction with the nuclear enzyme type II DNA topoisomerase ( 10 ) .
Anthracyclines have also been shown to be potent differentiation inducers , when used at subtoxic concentrations , in numerous experimental systems in vitro and in vivo ( 8 ) .
Nevertheless , most of these approaches describe the appearance either of morphological changes or differentiation markers but remain unclear on the molecular basis of these effects .
Previous studies using erythroleukemia cell lines ( MEL cells and human KMOE and K562 cell lines ) have demonstrated that ACLA and DOX , at subtoxic concentrations , are able to induce the appearance of hemoglobin-producing cells ( 8 ) .
Using the human KS562 cell line as a model of erythroid differentiation , we reported earlier that DOX- and ACLA-induced cell hemoglobinization was accompanied by an increased expression of globin genes ( 11 ) and induction of EPOR expression ( 12 ) , respectively .
Moreover , we recently described that both ACLA and DOX induced an increase in y-globin and PBGD mRNA levels , whereas EPOR mRNA was enhanced only in ACLA-treated cells ( 13 ) .
Because erythroid-specific transcription factors , especially GATA-1 and NF-E2 , have been shown to play a central role in the control of erythroid gene promoters ( 14 , 15 ) , they could be involved in the anthracycline-induced differentiation process .
The major erythroid DNA-binding protein , i.e .
, GATA-1 , recognizes the sequence ( A/T ) GATA ( A/G ) , which has been found in the regulatory domains of several erythroid-specific genes ( 14 ) , including globins ( 16 ) , EPOR ( 17 ) , PBGD ( 18 ) , and interestingly , GATA-1 itself ( 19 ) .
Convincing evidence for the central role of GATA-1 in regulating eryth-ropoiesis has been provided by disrupting this locus via ® The abbreviations used are : ACLA , aclacinomycin ; CHX , cycloheximide ; DOX , doxorubicin ; EPOR , erythropoietin receptor ; GAPDH , glyceralde-hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ; MEL , murine eythroleukemia ; PBGD , porphobilinogen deaminase .
1024 - Regulation of Erythroid Gene Expression by Anthracyclines homologous recombination ( 20 ) .
Besides , native NF-E2 is an obligate heterodimer of two basic leucine zipper proteins , p45 and p18 .
The expression of p45 is largely restricted to hematopoietic tissue ( 15 ) , whereas p18 is widely expressed and belongs to v-maf-related proteins ( 21 ) .
The AP-1-related transcription factor NF-E2 recognizes an extended AP-1 site , ( T/C ) TGCTGA ( C/G ) TCA ( T/C ) , initially characterized in the PBGD gene promoter ( 18 ) and in the locus control region of human B-globin ( 22 ) .
Such a critical role of erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 in the anthracycline-induced differentiation was evoked in our preliminary results , which showed that ACLA induced an increase in the binding capacity of either GATA-1 or NF-E2 to the promoter of the y-globin or PBGD gene , respectively ( 23 ) .
Furthermore , expression of GATA-1 and NF-E2 mRNA was increased in ACLA-treated cells ( 13 ) .
In contrast , DOX treatment of cells did not significantly affect the level of erythroid-specific transcription factor expression ( 13 ) .
Such data led us to hypothesize that ACLA and DOX may induce erythroid differentiation by distinct mechanisms .
Therefore , the present report compares drug effects on both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events occurring when cells are induced to differentiate .
Results indicate that ACLA up-regulated the transcription of erythroid genes ( y-globin , PBGD , and EPOAR ) in a protein synthesis-dependent way , without affecting RNA stability .
In contrast , DOX increased stability of erythroid transcripts without any apparent effect on transcriptional activity .
These results clearly show that each anthracycline enhanced erythroid-specific gene expression by unrelated mechanisms despite their closely related structures .
Results Increased Transcription of Erythroid Genes in ACLA- but not DOX-treated Cells .
The progressive increase of y-globin and PBGD mRNAs during ACLA- and DOX-induced differentiation of K562 cells has already been reported in our previous work and was maximal at day 3 after induction .
In addition , an increase of EPOR , NF-E2 , and GATA-1 mRNAs was observed in ACLA- but not DOX-treated cells ( 13 ) .
These results prompted us to investigate the effects of both anthracyclines regarding transcriptional activity .
Therefore , nuclear run-on experiments were performed using isolated nuclei from uninduced and anthracycline-induced K562 cells .
Treatment of cells with 20 nm ACLA or 40 nm DOX for 48 h led to the appearance of 51 and 43 % of benzidine-positive cells , respectively , versus < 5 % in control cells .
As shown in Fig .
1 , the transcription of erythroid genes was markedly enhanced in nuclei from ACLA-treated cells .
A 2-fold increase in EPOR and PBGD gene transcription was observed , whereas the increase in y-globin gene transcription was slightly higher ( 3.6-fold ) .
Moreover , the transcription of erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 was also increased ( 5-fold ) in ACLA-treated cells .
In contrast , the transcription level of y-globin , PBGD , and EPOR genes remained largely unchanged in nuclei from DOX-treated cells in comparison with the basal transcriptional level of these genes in control cells ( Fig .
1 ) .

Erythroid gene transcription in ACLA- and DOX-treated cells .
Nuclei were isolated from cells grown for 48 h in medium alone ( Contro ! )
or in the presence of 20 nm ACLA or 40 nm DOX .
Nuclear run-on assays were performed as described in `` Materials and Methods , `` and equal amounts of radiolabeled mRNA were hybridized onto the indicated DNA probes ; pGEM-7 and Bluescript plasmid vectors were used as negative controls .
Quantification was performed using a GS-363 molecular imager ( Bio-Rad ) , and blots were then submitted to autoradiography .
Results are representative of three independent experiments .
radioactivity quantification ( see `` Materials and Methods `` ) indicates that the GATA-1 signal , which was minimal in control cells , is 3-fold less important in DOX-treated cells .
Thus , DOX-induced differentiation of K562 cells did not result from an enhancement of erythroid gene transcription , despite an increased steady-state level of PBGD and y-globin mRNAs .
Hybridization of radiolabeled RNA with a GAPDH cDNA probe indicated that the transcriptional activity of treated and untreated nuclei was nearly the same ( Fig .
1 ) .
Increased Stability of Erythroid mRNAs in DOX- but not ACLA-treated Cells .
Because transcriptional activation of PBGD and y-globin genes was not involved in DOX-treated cells , the accumulation of these mRNAs may be the result of their stabilization .
Furthermore , although ACLA stimulated erythroid gene transcription , the involvement of a posttranscriptional event could not be excluded .
To assess this possibility , the half-lives of PBGD and GATA-1 mRNAs were determined by using the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D ( 5 ug/m ! )
added to either uninduced or induced K562 cells .
Preliminary experiments showed that actinomycin D , up to 10 ug/ml , was without any effect on viability and differentiation of K562 cells ( data not shown ) .
After 3 days of treatment with ACLA or DOX , the level of mRNA was determined by Northern blot at 2 , 4 , and 8 h following actinomycin D addition .

5.5 h and was not significantly modified after 3 days of treatment with 20 nm ACLA , despite a great difference in hemoglobinized cell levels ( 72 % in ACLA-treated cells versus 2 % in control cells ) .
Therefore , changes in the steady-state level of PBGD mRNA in ACLA-treated cells were not a consequence of altered mRNA stability .
In contrast , the stability of PBGD mRNA gradually increased during the DOX differentiation time course ( Fig .
2 ) .
Indeed , the PBGD mRNA half-life in DOX-treated cells was comparable to that of control cells at 24 h after induction and increased up to 6.5 h and notably greater than 8 h at 48 and 72 h , respectively .
This increase in stability occurred in a specific manner , as attested by the unchanged level of GAPDH mRNA in DOX-treated cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Similar results were obtained with GATA-1 mRNA .
As shown in Fig .
3 , the half-life of GATA-1 mRNA was not affected in ACLA-treated cells , whereas DOX induced an increase in GATA-1 mRNA stability in comparison with untreated cells .
As for PBGD mRNA , the increase in GATA-1 mRNA half-life appeared 48 h after induction ( 6 versus 4 h ) and reached a maximum at 72 h ( 8 versus 4 h ) .
Nevertheless , the increase in the GATA-1 transcript half-life in DOX-treated cells was lower than that of PBGD mRNA .
Besides , the half-life of y-globin mRNA , which has been reported to be at least 24 h in K562 cells ( 24 ) , could not be determined , because cell viability in long-term culture in the 1.5- a CONTROL © - AcLA a a _ Dox g 1.047 3 € f ¢ ~ \ 0.0 T T ' T T T T T T U 0 2 4 6 8 10 hours Control ACLA DOX hours 0 2 4 8 0 2 4 8 0 2 4 8 can : 0000 Fig .

Requirement of de Novo Protein Synthesis in Anthracycline-induced Differentiation .
The transcriptional activation of erythroid genes induced by ACLA suggests the involvement of transcription factors and possibly their de novo synthesis .
In addition , the posttranscriptional stabilization of erythroid mRNAs in DOX-treated cells may also require protein synthesis .
To assess this de novo protein synthesis requirement , K562 cells were incubated for 48 h with ACLA or DOX in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX .
Preliminary experiments showed that 5 ug/ml CHX efficiently blocked total protein synthesis by at least 95 % , without affecting the cell viability of cultures treated with CHX alone , CHX and anthracyclines , or anthracyclines alone ( data not shown ) .
Besides , CHX was seen to inhibit the appearance of hemoglobinized cells following ACLA or DOX treatment ( Table 1 ) , which was supported at the molecular level by Northern blot analysis of erythroid mRNAs .
Indeed , in uninduced cells , PBGD and y-globin mRNA levels were unchanged in the presence of CHX , whereas in ACLA- and DOX-treated cells , CHX abolished the overexpression of PBGD and y-globin mRNAs , thus leading back to mRNA basal expression ( Fig .
44 ) .
Moreover , in ACLA-treated cells , the increase in GATA-1 and NF-E2 mRNA levels was abolished in the presence of CHX ( Fig .
48 ) .
In contrast , the basal level of NF-E2 mRNA in control and DOX-treated cells was only slightly affected by CHX ( Fig .
4B ) , whereas that of 1025 1026 - Regulation of Erythroid Gene Expression by Anthracyclines Table 1 | Inhibition of anthracycline-induced differentiation of K562 cells by CHX Hemoglobinized cells ( % ) `` Inducer Without CHX With CHX None 3.0 + 0.5 3.5 + 0.5 ACLA 53.0 + 2.0 8.0 + 0.6 DOX 46.0 + 1.0 6.0 + 0.4 * Differentiation of K562 cells was determined as a percentage of benzidine-positive cells after 2 days of culture with the indicated inducer and in the presence or absence of 5 ug/ml CHX .

GATA-1 mRNA was decreased under the basal level of control cells ( Fig .
4B ) .
Thus , despite the distinct modes of action of ACLA and DOX , they both require de novo protein synthesis to achieve overexpression of erythroid genes and differentiation of K562 cells .
Increase in GATA-1 Protein Level in ACLA- but not DOX-treated Cells .
To verify that enhancement of GATA-1 gene expression in ACLA-treated cells resulted in an increased protein level , immunoblots were performed by using a monoclonal antibody directed against GATA-1 .
This antibody appeared to recognize a single band with an apparent M , of 50,000 in K562 cell extracts , which corresponds to the purified recombinant GATA-1 protein ( Fig .
5 ) .
GATA-1 protein level was studied as a function of time after ACLA treatment of K562 cells .
As shown in Fig .
5 , a marked increase in GATA-1 protein appeared as soon as 24 h after treatment , in comparison with control cells , and was sustained up to 72 h. in contrast , DOX failed to increase GATA-1 protein level , as expected from the unchanged mRNA level ( Fig .
48 ; Ref .
13 ) and despite the stabilization of GATA-1 mRNA ( Fig .
3 ) .
Discussion In this study , we used human multipotent K562 cells as a model !
system to examine the molecular aspects of erythroid differentiation induced by conventional cancer chemothera-peutic agents .
Among the potent antitumor drugs of the anthracycline group , ACLA and DOX have been reported to specifically stimulate hemoglobin synthesis and expression of erythroid genes such as y-globin and PBGD ( 13 ) .
The present data clearly indicate that these two anthracyclines affect the erythroid gene program through distinct molecular mechanisms .
They reinforce the differences previously described for cellular and biochemical events associated with ACLA- and DOX-differentiating effects : these include distinct effects on the synthesis of nonglobin proteins , on the hemoglobin types produced ( 11 , 13 ) , and on the appearance of membrane EPOR ( 12 ) , known to play a key role in the differentiation of erythroid cells .
However , the differentiating effects of both drugs were irreversible and were associated with a loss of self-renewal capacity ( 25 ) .
Such observations were consistent with a process of terminal differentiation .
Using run-on assays , ACLA was seen to induce an increased transcription of late erythroid-specific genes , including y-globin , PBGD , and EPOR , without any effect on their A Control _ ACLA DOX CHK | O- + O- 0 + - + y-globin .

Northern blots of total RNAs were successively hybridized with PBGD and y-globin ( A ) and GATA-1 and NF-E2 ( B ) probes .
Each membrane was then hybridized with a GAPDH probe as control .
The results presented are representative of three independent experiments .
mRNA stability .
This enhanced transcription could explain the previously observed accumulation of the corresponding erythroid mRNAs ( 13 ) and the activation of the erythroid regulatory regions of these genes ( 26 ) during the ACLA differentiation time course .
Furthermore , this mRNA increase was inhibited in the presence of CHX , indicating that the enhancement of the transcription rate was dependent on de novo protein synthesis .
As reported previously , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Northern blotting , the differentiating effect of ACLA was also seen to be accompanied by an overexpression of the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 ( 13 , 23 ) .

- Analysis of GATA-1 protein level in ACLA- and DOX-treated cells .
Cells were grown in medium alone ( Lane C ) or in the presence of 20 nm ACLA or 40 nm DOX for 24 , 48 , or 72 h. After cell lysis , 60 ug total proteins were separated by denaturating electrophoresis , and then immunoblot-ting was performed using a monoclonal antibody directed against human GATA-1 .
Purified recombinant human GATA-1 protein was used as a positive control ( Lane G ) .
suggesting that such erythroid K562 inducers may exert their differentiating effects in part by up-regulating the expression of key erythroid transcription factors .
The present data strongly argue in favor of this hypothesis .
First , the transcription rate of GATA-1 was enhanced during ACLA treatment without any modification of its mRNA stability , and similar to late erythroid genes , this up-regulation appeared to be dependent on de novo protein synthesis .
Second , GATA-1 protein content increased during cell maturation , as analyzed by Western blotting .
Nevertheless , the involvement of other erythroid-specific or ubiquitous transcription factors in ACLA-induced differentiation of K562 cells could not be ruled out .
Indeed , Krlip-pel family factors such as the ubiquitous protein Sp1 and the erythroid-restricted factor EKLF have been reported to physically interact and functionally synergize with GATA-1 ( 28 ) .
Cooperative interactions between GATA proteins and NF-E2 or AP-1 transcription factors ( f.e .
, Jun and Fos ) have also been described for the expression of the endothelin 1 gene ( 29 ) and the e-globin gene ( 30 ) .
In addition , we recently showed that ACLA activated the GATA-1 promoter via a GATA-1-independent mechanism , because this region does not contain any binding site for this transcription factor ( 26 ) .
Taken together , these results suggest the existence of complex interactions between nonerythroid and erythroid-restricted transcription factors , providing an additional level of regulation that could be affected by anthracycline treatment .
In contrast to ACLA , the transcription rate of the PBGD gene was unchanged in DOX-treated cells .
That of GATA-1 appeared as very weakly expressed in uninduced cells and even decreased in DOX-treated cells .
Additionally , PBGD and GATA-1 mRNA stability was markedly increased , as assessed by actinomycin D blockage of RNA polymerase .
The apparent half-lives of PBGD and GATA-1 mRNAs were found to be notably greater and slightly greater than 8 h , respectively , in DOX-treated cells , compared with 4.5 and 4 h in uninduced and ACLA-treated cells , respectively .
We chose to analyze the stability of these RNAs rather than that of globin mRNAs , which are quite stable in K562 cells , with a half-life of at least 24 h ( 24 ) .
With such stable mRNAs , the concomitant exposure of cells for more than 24 h to both actinomycin D and antitumor drugs considerably affected cell viability .
The mechanisms by which DOX could induce mRNA stabilization are still largely unknown .
The proteins involved may be any of the RNA-binding protein family ( for review , see Ref .
31 ) .
Among them , polyadenylic acid-binding proteins have been shown to bind B-globin mRNA and then protect mRNA from rapid degradation ( 31 ) .
DOX-induced increases of PBGD and y-globin mRNAs were inhibited by CHX , indicating that mRNA stabilization was dependent on de novo synthesis of proteins , which could be a mRNA stability factor ( 32 ) .
Although DOX induced the stabilization of the erythroid transcripts , it failed to increase GATA-1 protein , which is in accord with the fact that DOX was found to alter neither the binding capacity and the steady-state mRNA levels of GATA-1 or NF-E2 ( 13 ) nor the activity of the GATA-1 promoter ( 26 ) .
This suggests that , in contrast to ACLA , erythroid transcription factor overexpression may not be required for DOX-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells .
Similar results were reported during butyrate-induced differentiation of erythroid J2E cells in which GATA-1 protein content was not modified ( 33 ) .
Besides , DOX-induced stabilization of late erythroid genes ( PBGD ) was accompanied by a marked rise in their mRNA and protein levels ( 13 ) .
Such a phenomenon could be sufficient to switch on the erythroid program .
To our knowledge , very few inducing agents have been described to act via stabilization of differentiation genes .
Indeed , in MEL cells , hemin and DMSO were shown to increase the stability of globin and ferrochelatase mRNAs , respectively ( 34 , 35 ) .
A destabilizing process has even been described in K562 cells during the switch from erythroid to megakaryocytic gene expression by phorbol ester , leading to a marked decrease in the half-lives of globin mRNAs ( 32 ) .
On the other hand , as observed with ACLA , numerous differentiation inducers of leukemic cells have been shown to regulate the expression of differentiation-associated genes via transcriptional mechanisms .
In MEL cells , hexamethylene bis-acetamide and butyrate have been reported to stimulate the rate of transcription of globin genes ( 36 ) .
Similar results were obtained in K562 cells after hemin and hydroxyurea treatment ( 37 ) or in J2E cells with GATA-1 transcripts stimulated by erythropoietin ( 33 ) .
In human promyelocytic HL-60 celis , mycophenolic acid and 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , were seen to increase transcription rates of MRP38 and MRP14 genes , which are involved in the monomyelocytic differentiation of these cells ( 38 ) .
Our results indicate that distinct regulatory pathways may be involved in the erythroid-differentiating effect of the anthracycline antitumor drugs ACLA and DOX .
They also allowed us to determine the share of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms in this effect .
Indeed , ACLA could activate the transcription of erythroid genes through overexpression of specific transcription factors , whereas DOX might act at the posttranscriptional level by increasing the half-lives of mRNAs independently from erythroid transcription factor expression .
The precise molecular mechanisms involved either in ACLA-induced up-regulation of tran 1027 1028 Regulation of Erythroid Gene Expression by Anthracyclines scription factors or in DOX stabilization of mRNAs remain to be defined .
Materials and Methods Cell Cultures .
K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FCS and 2 mm L-glutamine in a 5 % CO ; humidified atmosphere .
Erythroid differentiation was induced by the addition of 20 nm ACLA ( Roger Bellon , Paris , France ) or 40 nm DOX ( Farmitalia Carlo Erba , Milan , Italy ) .
Both drugs were reconstituted in sterile water according to the manufacturer 's instructions and were diluted in culture medium immediately before use .
Nuclear Run-on Analysis .
Nuclear run-on experiments were performed as described previously by Morle et al .
( 39 ) .
Briefly , nuclei were isolated from 5 X 10 `` K562 cells by lysis in 0.5 % NP4O buffer [ 10 mm Tris-HCI ( pH 7.4 ) , 60 mu KCI , 15 mu NaCl , 0.15 mm spermidine , 0.5 mm spermine , 2 mm EDTA , and 0.5 % NP4O ] for 5 min on ice .
Nuclei were collected after centrifugation at 700 x g for 5 min at 4°C , resuspended in 200 pl nuclear freezing buffer [ 50 mm Tris-HCI ( pH 8 ) , 75 mm NaCl , 0.1 mm EDTA , and 50 % glycerol ] , and then stored at -80°C until use .
/n vitro RNA elongation was performed using 100 wi nuclei suspension diluted in 100 pil transcription buffer [ 10 mm Tris-HCI ( pH 8 ) , 10 mm MgClz , 10 mm MnCl , 300 mm KCI , 0.5 mm DTT , and 1 mm each ATP , GTP , and CTP ] and incubated at 30°C for 20 min in the presence of 100 Ci [ a-°°PJUTP ( 3000 Ci/mmol ; DuPont New England Nuclear ) .
Incubation was then allowed to continue for 5 min at 30°C in the presence of 0.5 ug/ul tRNA and 0.1 ug/ul RNase-free DNase | ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , followed by proteinase K treatment ( 0.1 ug/ul ) for 1 h. Labeled elongated transcripts were isolated with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol and 2.5 m ammo-nium acetate .
Human cDNAs encoding PBGD , EPOR , and GATA-1 were contained in pGEMT7 ( Promega ) , whereas human genomic y-globin DNA and rat GAPDH cDNA were in Bluescript vector ( Stratagene ) .
Each linear-ized probe was immobilized onto a nylon filter ( Positive Membrane ; Ap-pligene ) and hybridized with equal amounts of radiolabeled RNA .
Hybridization for 36 h at 42°C was followed by washing twice in 2x SSC [ 1x SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m Na citrate ( pH 7.0 ) ] and 0.1 % SDS at 50°C for 10 min and twice in 1 % SSC and 0.1 % SDS at 60°C for 30 min .
Quantification of radiolabeled RNA hybridization was performed using a GS 363 molecular imager ( Bio-Rad ) .
RNA Analysis .
Total RNAs were extracted using Trizol reagent ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) and submitted to electrophoresis and Northem blot hybridization with radiolabeled probes as described previously ( 13 ) .
For the determination of mRNA stability , each culture period ( 1-3 days in the presence or absence of ACLA or DOX ) was followed by a treatment with 5 g/m !
actinomycin D for 2 , 4 , and 8 h before RNA extraction .
The Northern blot autoradiograms were quantified by densitometry .
To assess the effect of protein synthesis inhibition , CHX was added 2 h before the beginning of ACLA or DOX treatment at the noncytotoxic concentration of 5 ug/ml .
The mRNAs were extracted after 48 h of culture in the presence or absence of differentiation inducers and analyzed by Northern blot .
As controls , K562 cells were treated with 20 nm ACLA or 40 nm DOX alone or CHX alone , and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion in each culture condition .
GATA-1 Protein Analysis .
About 5 x 10° cells were lysed in Laemmii sample buffer and immediately boiled for 5 min .
Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay method , and 60 ug protein were loaded on a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
The separated proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane ( Hybond C ; Amer-sham ) .
The membrane was pretreated for 1 h with 5 % dry milk containing Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight with anti-GATA-1 monoclonal antibody ( SC-265 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) at a final concentration of 1 ug/ml .
After washing with 0.05 % Tween 20-containing Tris-buffered saline , the membrane was incubated for 1 h with antirat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( Amersham ) , and the immunore-active proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system ( Amersham ) .
Purified recombinant human GATA-1 protein was used as a positive control .
