6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; A CD28-Associated Signaling Pathway Leading to Cytokine Gene Transcription and T Cell Proliferation Without TCR Engagement ' Renate Sicfken , * Stefan Klein-HeBling , `` Edgar Serfling , ' `` Roland Kurrle , * and Reinhard Schwinzer `` * Stimulation of resting human T cells with the CD28-specific mAb BW 828 induces proliferation and cytokine synthesis without further requirement for TCR coengagement .
This observation prompted us to postulate that signal 2 ( costimulatory signal ) alone without signal 1 ( TCR signal ) can activate T cells .
To test whether this putative function of CD28 is mediated via a particular signaling pathway , we compared early signaling events initiated in resting T cells by the stimulatory mAb BW 828 with signals triggered by the nonstimulating CD28 mAb 9.3 .
Stimulation of T cells with BW 828 induced an increase in intracellular Ca** , but did not lead to detectable activation of the protein kinases p56 `` ** and c-Raf-1 .
This pathway resulted in the induction of the transcription factors NF-AT , and proteins binding to the CD28 response element of the IL-2 promoter .
On the other hand , stimulation of T cells with mAb 9.3 increased the level of intracellular Ca** and triggered the activation of p56 `` ** and c-Raf-1 , but was unable to induce the binding of transcription factors to the IL-2 promoter .
In contrast to the differential signaling of BW 828 and 9.3 in resting T cells , the two mAbs exhibited a similar pattern of early signaling events in activated T cells and Jurkat cells ( p56** activation , association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with CD28 ) , indicating that the signaling capacity of CD28 changes with activation .
These data support the view that stimulation through CD28 can induce some effector functions in T cells and suggest that this capacity is associated with a particular pattern of early signaling events .
The Journal of Immunology , 1998 , 161 : 1645-1651. ccording to the two-signal model , complete T cell acti-A vation requires Ag-mediated triggering of the TCR ( sig- nal 1 ) in concert with costimulatory signals that can be provided by the CD28 molecule ( signal 2 ) ( 1 ) .
The two-signal concept also implies that triggering of either signal 1 or signal 2 could be a regulatory mechanism in T cell activation .
There are numerous data dealing with the signaling and cellular effects of signal 1 alone , which is regarded to induce anergy in T cells ( 2 ) .
In contrast , less is known of the cellular effects induced in T cells by isolated CD28 stimulation in the absence of TCR occupancy .
The observation that various mAbs to CD28 as well as cells trans-fected with the CD28 ligands CD80 ( B7.1 ) and CD86 ( B7.2 ) are unable to trigger effector functions in resting T cells led to the conclusion that induction of signal 2 alone has no consequence on T cell functions ( 3 ) .
Although stimulation of the CD28 molecule alone usually does not induce effector functions in resting human T cells , several biochemical signaling events induced by CD28 can be observed .

In addition , strong cross-linking of CD28 in resting T cells can trigger an increase in the level of free cytoplasmic calcium ions [ Ca * ) ; `` ( 8 ) .
Furthermore , in Jurkat cells , cross-linking of CD28 causes the activation of phospholipase Cy1 and subsequent phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis ( 9 ) .
The role of these signals in the costimulatory function of CD28 is not well defined .
Since transcription factors binding to the NF-AT and NF-B sites or the CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) of the IL-2 promoter are not activated by sole CD28 stimulation of resting T cells ( 6 , 10 , 11 ) , it has been suggested that CD28 pathways do not directly control gene transcription but have to converge with TCR signals to fully activate transcription factors and thereby induce cytokine synthe-sis .
Current models assume that both pathways are integrated on the level of the protein kinases JNK1 and JNK2 , since these kinases need both TCR and CD28 signals for full activation ( 12 ) .
We have recently shown that stimulation of resting human T cells with the CD28-specific mAb BW 828 can trigger proliferation and IL-2 production without further requirement for TCR engagement ( 13 ) .
This agrees with the activity of a mAb specific for rat CD28 that triggers T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo ( 14 ) .
Two very recent observations suggest that in addition to CD28-specific mAbs , binding of CD80 or CD86 to CD28 can induce T cell functions without TCR involvement .
Firstly , in vitro interaction of CD80 with CD28 on resting memory cells has been described to provide sufficient stimulus for the generation of effector T cells in the absence of specific Ag ( 15 ) .
Secondly , in the absence of TCR signaling , binding of CD86/B7.2 to CD28 might deliver a 3 Abbreviations used in this paper : [ Ca** ) ; , intracellular Ca** concentration ; CD28RE , CD28 response element ; gam Ig , goat anti-mouse Ig ; PAA , polyacrylamide ; CsA , cyclosporin A ; EMSA ( s ) , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( s ) ; AP-1 , activator protein-1 ; PI 3-kinase , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase .

Taken together , these data support the view that isolated CD28 signaling is not a neutral event for T cells but can induce T cell functions independent of the TCR .
Since binding of mAb BW 828 seems to mimic this particular function of CD28 , the analysis of the signaling events initiated by this mAb could provide insights into the activation pathways leading to the induction of T cell functions by sole CD28 triggering .
We now report that this type of activation is associated with a pattern of signaling events different from that of isolated CD3 or typical CD28 costimulation and is able to activate several transcription factors .
Materials and Methods Antibodies The CD28-specific mAbs 9.3 ( IgG2a ) ( 17 ) and BW 828 ( IgG2a ) ( 18 ) were used for the induction of CD28-mediated signaling events .
mAb 9.3 was obtained from Bristol Myers Squibb ( Seattle , WA ) .
TCR/CD3-mediated signaling was induced by the CD3e mAb OKT3 ( IgG2a ) , which was provided by Cilag ( Alsbach Hahnlein , Germany ) .
In some experiments T cells were partially activated by culture with soluble mAb BMA 031 ( IgG2b ) , which detects a monomorphic determinant on the « B-TCR ( 18 ) .
mAb 9.3 has been clustered to CD28 in leukocyte typing workshops .
A characterization of BW 828 has been described previously ( 13 ) .
Cell preparations and induction of T cell activation PBMC were isolated from heparinized peripheral human blood by Ficoll gradient centrifugation .
Small resting T cells were then prepared by E-rosetting .
The E* T cell population was incubated overnight at 37°C to remove residual adherent mononuclear cells by plastic adherence .
Usually > 95 % of the remaining cells were CD3 * , and 98 to 99 % reacted with CD2 mAb .
This cell population did not contain monocytes as detected by flow cytometry ( < 0.3 % CD14* cells ) and did not proliferate in response to mitogenic concentrations of CD3 mAb .
To induce CD3- or CD28-mediated activation , T cells ( 2 X 10 % /ml ) were incubated with OKT3 ( 3 pg/ml ) alone , the CD28 mAbs alone ( 9.3 ; final ascites dilution of 1/3200 ; BW 828 , 10 ug/m ! )
, or combinations of CD3 and CD28 mAbs for 30 min on ice .
Ab-loaded cells were washed , and cell-bound mAbs were cross-linked either by the addition of soluble goat anti-mouse Ig ( gam Ig ; 3-10 pg/ml ! )
or by gam Ig ( 3 g/m ! )
immobilized on the plastic surface of microtiter plates .
RNA extraction and PCR-assisted analysis of cytokine mRNA T cells loaded with CD3 , CD28 , or CD3 plus CD28 mAbs as described above were cultured in flat-bottom multidish plates ( 2.5 X 10° cells/2 ml/ well ) precoated with 3 ug/ml gam Ig .
After 4 h , total RNA was isolated from 5 X 10° cells as described by Chomezynsky and Sacchi ( 19 ) and transcribed into cDNA using reverse transcriptase from Moloney murine leukemia virus ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
Amplification of cDNA was conducted with 2.5 U Taq polymerase ( Stratagene ) in a Gene Amp PCR System 9600 ( Perkin-Elmer/Cetus , Norwalk , CT ) by 30 three-temperature cycles consisting of denaturation at 94°C ( 55 s ) , annealing at 55°C ( 60 s ) , and elongation at 72°C ( 60 s ) .
The following primers were used : IL-2 : sense primer , antisense primer , IL-4 : sense primer , 5-CTTCCCCCTCTGTTCTTCCT-3 ' ; antisense primer , 5'-TTC CTGTCGAGCCGTTTCAG-3 ' ; IFN-y : sense primer , 5-AGTTATATCT TGGCTTTTCA-3 ' ; antisense primer , 5'-ACCGAATAATTAGTCAGC TT-3 ' ; and B-actin : sense primer , 5'-GAAACTACCITTCAACTCCATC-3 ' ; antisense primer , PCR products were separated in 2 % agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide .
Western blot analysis T cells ( 2 X 10 % /ml ) were loaded with CD3 or CD28 mAbs and resuspended in culture medium without FCS .
Cross-linking was performed with 10 ug/ml soluble gam Ig for 15 min .
After stimulation , cells were spun and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1 % Nonidet P-40 in 50 mM Tris-HC ] ( pH 7.4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM Na , ; VO4 , 1 mM PMSF , and 1 pg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin .
Following 30- to 45-min incubation on ice , lysates were centrifuged ( 8000 X g , 10 min ) , and the supernatants were mixed with 5X SDS sample buffer ( 310 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 6.8 ) , 50 % glycerol , 10 % SDS , 25 % 2-ME , and 0.5 mg/ml bromophenol blue ) .
The samples were boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed through CD28-MEDIATED T CELL ACTIVATION WITHOUT TCR STIMULATION 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide ( PAA ) gels .
Proteins were transferred to nitro-cellulose by semidry blotting .
Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were detected by the mAb 4G10 purchased from Biomol ( Hamburg , Germany ) , p56** was detected by a polyclonal rabbit anti-human Ick kinase Ab ( Bi-omol ) , and c-Raf-1 was detected after incubation of the membrane with a polyclonal rabbit anti-c-Raf-1 Ab ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Detection of bound Abs was performed using a standard alkaline phosphatase method ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) with nitro blue tetra-zolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate or CSPD ( Tropix Lumines-cence , Serva , Heidelberg , Germany ) as substrates .
Immunoprecipitation of CD28-associated proteins Jurkat cells ( 2 X 10 `` ; 4 X 10®/ml ) were left untreated or stimulated for 15 min with CD28 mAbs 9.3 ( final dilution of ascites , 1/3200 ) or BW 828 ( 5 ug/tol ) .
Cells were then lysed in buffer containing 1 % Brij 96 in 50 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 7.4 ) , 50 mM EDTA , 1 mM Na , ; VO , , 1 mM PMSF , and 1 ug/tal of each leupeptin and pepstatin for 30 min and spun , and the cleared cell lysates were subjected to CD28 immunoprecipitation by the addition of 50 pul protein G-Sepharose ( Pharmacia , Freiburg , Germany ) .
The same amount of CD28 mAbs used for stimulation was added to the cell lysates of untreated cells .
After incubation for 2 h at 4°C , the Sepharose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.5 % Brij 96 .
The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling the samples for 5 min with 25 pl of nonreducing SDS sample buffer ( 62 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 6.8 ) , 10 % glycerol , 2 % SDS , and 0.5 mg/ml bromophenol blue ) .
After electrophoresis through 8 % SDS-PAA gels , the proteins were transferred to ni-trocellulose .
Coimmunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase was detected with a polyclonal rabbit Ab directed to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase ( Biomol ) and a standard alkaline phosphatase method as described above .
Measurement of [ Ca `` ] , levels The concentration of cytoplasmic calcium was determined using the fluo-3 method and flow cytometry ( 20 ) .
T cells ( 5 X 10 % /m1l ) were loaded with 4 M fluo-3/AM ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) in culture medium without FCS at 37°C in the dark .
After 20 min , the cell concentration was diluted to 1 X 10¢ % /ml , and the incubation time was prolonged for 40 min .
Cells were loaded on ice with CD3 and CD28 mAbs as described above .
After washing , cells were suspended in Ca** buffer ( 25 mM HEPES ( pH 7.2 ) , 140 mM NaCl , 1.8 mM CaCly2H,0 , 1 mM MgCly6H,0 , 3 mM KCI ] , and 10 mM p-glucose ) and stored at room temperature in the dark .
At a final dilution of 2 X 10°/ml , cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer using Chronys software ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) .
For cross-linking of cell-bound Abs , 3 ug/ml gam Ig was added .
Fluo-3 fluorescence was monitored continuously for 3 min at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm .
DNA probes and electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) For detection of DNA binding activities , T cells were induced with CD3 , CD28 , or CD3 plus CD28 mAbs and cultured for 16 h in flat-bottom multidish plates ( 2.5 X 10° cells/2 ml/well ) precoated with 3 ug/ml gam Ig .
Cells were then washed , and nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as previously described ( 21 ) .
Equal amounts of the extracts ( 3 pg of crude protein ) were incubated with the °°P end-labeled oligonucleotides .
Binding reactions were performed in the presence of 0.5 ug poly ( dI-dC ) in buffer consisting of 60 mM HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 150 mM KCI , 12 % Ficoll , 3 mM DTT , and 3 mM EDTA .
After 10-min incubation on ice , protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe on a 5 % PAA gel .
In supershift assays 0.5 ul of Ab was added to the reaction mixture simultaneously with the protein , and the mixture was incubated as described above .
In the competition experiments a 25- to 50-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was added to the incubation mixture 5 min before addition of the labeled probe .
The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows : NFE-AT ( distal NF-AT binding site of the mouse IL-2 promoter ) , 5 `` -CCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCA-3 ' ; NF- « B ( distal T cell element of the IL-2 promoter ) , 5'-GAGGGATTTCACCTAAA-3 ' ; AP-1 ( distal T cell element of the IL-2 promoter ) , 5'-AGAGTCATCA-GAA-3 ' ; and CD28RE ( proximal TPA response element ; positions -166/ -154 of the IL-2 promoter ) , 5-AAAGAAATTCCAG-3 ' .
Results Induction of cytokine gene transcription by sole CD28 stimulation The two CD28-specific Abs , BW 828 and 9.3 , are directed to different epitopes on the CD28 molecule .
In combination with 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology TCR/CD3 signaling , both Abs induce comparable proliferative responses in human T cells .
In the absence of TCR/CD3 coengagement , however , only mAb BW 828 is able to trigger a proliferative response and IL-2 synthesis ( 13 ) .
Further analysis of this type of T cell activation revealed a BW 828-mediated stimulation of IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-y gene transcriptions ( Fig .
1 ) .
This cytokine pattern was also observed after simultaneous stimulation of T cells with the CD3 mAb OKT3 plus BW 828 or OKT3 plus 9.3 .
Stimulation with mAb 9.3 alone did not trigger any cytokines , whereas OKT3 alone induced IFN-y but neither IL-2 nor IL-4 mRNA .
CD28 mAbs 9.3 and BW 828 exhibit a differential pattern of early signaling events in resting T cells The stimulatory capacity of mAb BW 828 prompted us to compare the early signaling events induced by this mAb with signals triggered by mAb 9.3 or OKT3 .
Since CD28 and CD3 stimulation has been shown to activate cellular protein tyrosine kinases , we first analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern in CD3- and CD28-stimulated T cells .
As shown in Figure 24 , CD3 stimulation triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates .
In some experiments weak phosphorylation of proteins at about 120 kDa was found after stimulation of T cells with mAb 9.3 .
In cells stimulated by BW 828 , however , no significant tyrosine phosphorylation was observed .
An analysis of the effect of CD28 triggering on the kinases p56 `` ** and c-Raf-1 revealed that 9.3 caused a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Ick from 56 to 60 kDa as previously described ( 22 ) and induced hyperphosphorylation of c-Raf-1 ( 5 ) ( Fig .
2 , B and C ) .
Similar effects were found after OKT3 stimulation , whereas mAb BW 828 triggered neither the appearance of p6 nor hyperphosphorylation of c-Raf-1 .
The lack of p56 `` * modification and c-Raf-1 activation in BW 828-stimulated cells was not due to delayed kinetics of signaling by this mAb , since prolonged cross-linking of BW 828 up to 60 min did not trigger these signals ( data not shown ) .

Transfer and blotting were performed as described in Materials and Methods .
Similar patterns were observed in a second experiment .

After subjecting whole cell lysates to 8 % SDS-PAGE , c-Raf-1 was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Raf-1 Ab .
Arrows indicate c-Raf-1 and hyperphosphorylated c-Raf-1 .
Similar data were obtained in a series of three additional experiments .
BW 828-induced T cell proliferation can be completely inhibited by CsA ( 13 ) , suggesting an activation of Ca* * -dependent signaling pathways by this mAb .
To test this possibility we analyzed the effects of BW 828 stimulation on the level of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration .
BW 828-loaded T cells showed a clear-cut calcium flux when cross-linked with a secondary gam Ig ( Fig .
3 ) .
A similar response was observed in OKT3- and 9.3-stimulated T cells .
Without cross-linking there was a small increase in OKT3-stimulated cells but not in 9.3- or BW 828-stimulated cells ( data not shown ) .
This pattern confirms earlier data on the signaling capacity of CD28 , which showed that CD28 stimulation by soluble mAb does not induce an increase in [ Ca** ] ; , whereas calcium-dependent pathways are activated by strong cross-linking of the CD28 molecule ( 8 ) .
The capacity of mAb BW 828 to induce Ca** mobilization also shows that its failure to activate p56 `` * and c-Raf-1 is not due to ineffective binding in these short term assays .
It is therefore most likely that the differential effects of BW 828 and 9.3 reflect the induction of alternative signaling pathways by binding of the two mAbs to the CD28 molecule .
mAbs 9.3 and BW 828 induce similar signaling events in activated T cells Some CD28-mediated signals can be detected in activated cells and the Jurkat cell line but not in resting T cells ( 3 , 23 ) .
We therefore asked whether the signaling events that were absent in BW 828-stimulated resting T cells can be found in activated T cells .
In PHA-induced lymphoblasts BW 828 was as effective as 9.3 at triggering the appearance of the p60 form of p56 `` ** ( Fig .

or protein G-Sepharose alone ( 9.3 and BW 828-stimulated cells , respectively ) as described in Materials and Methods .

Cells remained unloaded ( @ ) or were loaded with the CD28 mAb 9.3 and BW 828 and cultivated ( 1 X 10° cells/well ) in micro-titerplates precoated with goat anti-mouse Ig .
Proliferation was measured after 72 h by [ °HJTdR uptake during the last 16 h of culture .
Results are expressed as mean cpm + SD of triplicate cultures .
Similar results were obtained in a second experiment .
We next asked whether the state of activation also has an effect on the cellular functions induced by CD28 stimulation .
To this end resting T cells and T cells that had been stimulated by soluble anti-TCR mAbs were studied .
Activation of purified T cells with soluble anti-TCR mAbs does not induce proliferation but renders cells responsive to progression signals ( 24 ) .
In resting T cells , only mAb BW 828 was able to trigger a proliferative response ( Table I ) .
However , partially activated T cells proliferated in response to both 9.3- and BW 828-mediated stimulation .
Together these data support the assumption that the signaling capacity of CD28 changes with activation ( 25 , 26 ) .
Induction of transcription factors by BW 828-mediated stimulation of T cells The CsA sensitivity of BW 828-mediated T cell proliferation ( 13 ) and the Ca* * flux ( Fig .
3 ) induced by this mAb strongly suggested the involvement of Ca**-dependent activation pathways .
Since Ca `` * -dependent signaling pathways play an important role in the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-AT ( 27 ) , we assumed that BW 828 stimulation might induce these factors to bind to the NF-AT sites of the IL-2 promoter .
To address this question , nuclear extracts from CD28- , CD3- , or €D28- plus CD3-stimulated T cells were analyzed for their binding to the °°P-la-beled distal NF-AT site probe in EMSAs .
In unstimulated T cells little binding activity was detected , and it was not enhanced by stimulation with the CD28 mAb 9.3 or by sole CD3 stimulation using mAb OKT3 ( Fig .
54 ) .
However , a moderate but clear-cut increase was detected in BW 828-stimulated T cells , albeit the protein/DNA complexes were less prominent , as after stimulation with OKT3 plus 9.3 or OKT3 plus BW 828 .
This is in line with a diminished IL-2 synthesis in BW 828-stimulated cells compared with that in cells stimulated by TCR/CD3 plus CD28 mAbs ( 13 ) .
Binding of proteins to the NE-AT oligonucleotide was partially inhibited by AP-1 competitor DNA , and anti-NF-AT , , Abs induced a distinct supershift , indicating binding of NF-AT , , and AP-1 to the distal NF-AT site after BW 828 stimulation ( Fig .
5B ) .
A small amount of NF- « B binding proteins was already found in the nuclei of unstimulated peripheral T cells ( Fig .
5C ) .
Stimulation with mAb 9.3 did not enhance these levels , whereas stimulation of cells with mAbs BW 828 or OKT3 resulted in a strong increase in protein binding to the NF- « B probe .
A further increase was found when T cells were stimulated with CD3 plus CD28 mAbs .
The NF- « B complexes were retarded by anti-p50 and anti-p65 Abs and marginally inhibited by anti-c-Rel ( Fig .
510 ) , indicating the binding of p50 and p65 to the « B probe of the IL-2 promoter .
Binding of proteins to the CD28RE was analyzed using an oligonucleotide spanning positions -154 to -166 of the IL-2 promoter .
Triggering of T cells with the nonstimulatory mAb 9.3 was without effect on protein binding to the CD28RE ( Fig .
6 ) .

Nuclear extracts of cells stimulated for 16 h as described above were prepared and analyzed by EMSA using an oligonucleotide containing the distal NF-AT binding site from the IL-2 promoter .
B , Analysis of NF-AT subunit composition .
The specificity of NF-AT binding was determined by the addition of unlabeled competitor DNA containing the AP-1 binding site ( TRE , ) from the IL-2 promoter or an Ab raised against NF-AT , to nuclear extracts from T cells stimulated with OKT3 plus BW 828 ( Zanes 1-3 ) and from T cells stimulated with BW 828 alone ( Zanes 4 and 5 ) .

Nuclear extracts of cells stimulated for 16 h as described above were prepared and analyzed in EMSAs using an oligonucleotide containing the NF-KB site from the IL-2 promoter .
D , Detection of NF-B subunits .
Nuclear extracts from T cells stimulated with OKT3 plus BW 828 were incubated in the absence ( Zane 7 ) and the presence ( lanes 2-4 ) of Abs directed to the indicated NF-KB subunits .
Nuclear extracts from T cells stimulated with BW 828 alone were used in lanes 5 through 8 .
Arrowheads indicate the shifted protein/DNA complexes .
828-stimulated cells , however , the generation of complexes consisting of two proteins was observed .
The binding of these proteins was also induced in OKT3-treated cells and in cells stimulated with both CD28 plus OKT3 .
Generation of the lower complex could be inhibited by a 50-fold excess of a cold NF-B site and could be supershifted by anti-p65 Abs .
The upper complex was supershifted by an Ab to NF-AT , , , , indicating the binding of RelA/ p65 and NF-AT , , to the CD28RE after BW 828 and/or OKT3 induction of T lymphocytes .
Discussion Stimulation of resting human T cells with the CD28-specific mAb BW 828 induces cytokine gene transcription and proliferation without a requirement for TCR engagement , suggesting that CD28 is not only a costimulatory molecule but is also able to generate a set of signals that induces some T cell effector functions ( 13 ) .
In this paper we have shown that the induction of T cell activation by sole CD28 stimulation is accompanied by a particular pattern of biochemical signaling events .
Binding of the nonstimulatory Ab 9.3 to CD28 triggered a shift in electrophoretic mobility of the tyrosine kinase p56 `` * , activated the kinase c-Raf-1 ( Fig .
2 ) , and increased the level of [ Ca* * ] ; ( Fig .
3 ) .
This pattern of signaling events confirms earlier observations on the stimulatory capacity of mAb 9.3 ( 4 , 5 , 8 ) .
The role of these signals is not well defined .
Since stimulation of T cells with 9.3 did not induce the transcription factors NF-AT and NF-KB ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) or cytokine gene transcription ( Fig .
1 ) , it is likely that the activation of the kinases p56 `` and c-Raf-1 in concert with Ca** mobilization are insufficient to induce transcriptional events .
It has recently been shown that T cells triggered by mAb 9.3 alone can become refractory to subsequent CD28 stimulation ( 28 ) .
One might therefore speculate that signals observed in 9.3-stimulated T cells not only are insufficient to trigger cytokine gene transcription without TCR signaling but may be inhibitory .
Indeed , 9.3-stimulated cells tend to contain a lesser amount of transcription factors compared with unstimulated cells ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) .
In contrast to the failure of mAb 9.3 to induce cytokine gene transcription , IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-y mRNA could readily be detected in T cells stimulated with mAb BW 828 ( Fig .
1 ) .
Since the two mAbs induced a differential pattern of early signaling events , it is unlikely that the different stimulatory capacities of 9.3 and BW 828 are due to quantitative differences in their potency to trigger signaling events .
The most likely explanation is therefore the induction of alternative signaling pathways by the two mAbs .
The early signaling steps induced by BW 828 remain speculative .
The absence of p56 `` ** modification could indicate that this molecule is not involved in the signaling pathway .
The existence of p56 `` *-independent signaling mechanisms via CD28 is suggested by the 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 1650 © § 0 §40 .L gm 92 .

Analysis of proteins binding to CD28RE of the IL-2 promoter .
Purified T cells ( 1 X 10° cells/ml ) were left unloaded ( unstim . )
or were loaded with saturating concentrations of 9.3 ( CD28 ) , BW 828 ( CD28 ) , OKT3 ( CD3 ) , OKT3 plus 9.3 , or OKT3 plus BW 828 .
Stimulation was performed by cultivating the cells on multiplates precoated with gam Ig ( see Materials and Methods for details ) .
After 16 h nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed in EMSAs .
Characterization of the proteins that bound to CD28RE was performed by adding unlabeled competitor DNA containing the NF- « B binding site , an Ab directed to the p65 subunit of NF-KB , or an Ab raised against NF-AT , , to the nuclear extracts from T cells stimulated with OKT3 plus BW 828 .
Similar patterns were observed using nuclear extracts from T cells stimulated with BW 828 alone ( data not shown ) .
The arrowheads indicate Ab-mediated supershifts .
® __ < - NF-AT W < -- p6S5 observation that the p56 `` *-deficient Jurkat cell line J.CAM does not produce IL-2 when stimulated by PMA/ionomycin but can be triggered to produce some IL-2 when stimulated by PMA/ionomycin plus immobilized CD28 mAb ( 29 ) .
On the basis of the assumption that p56 `` ** is not involved in CD28-mediated triggering by BW 828 , it is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of CD28 , which is required for the recruitment of the adaptor molecules PI 3-kinase ( 23 , 30 ) , GRB-2/S0O8 ( 31 ) , and ITK/EMT ( 32 ) to CD28 , is mediated by a different kinase .
Since neither ITK nor ZAP-70 seems to phosphorylate the receptor ( 33 ) , the kinase p59 `` could be a good candidate .
The CD28-specific mAb BW 828 was unable to trigger a shift in electrophoretic mobility of the tyrosine kinase p56 `` and to activate the kinase c-Raf-1 in resting T cells , whereas both signals could be detected after stimulation of PHA-activated T cells and Jurkat cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
This pattern strongly suggests that the signaling capacity of CD28 changes with activation and is in line with data showing that several CD28 signaling events can only be observed in preactivated T cells and in Jurkat cells ( 3 ) .
The molecular differences between CD28 on resting vs activated T cells are not known exactly .
It has been suggested that previous TCR-mediated activation induces phosphorylation of CD28 and binding of PI 3-kinase ( 3 ) .
In addition , p56 `` ** is associated with CD28 in exponentially growing , but not in resting , Jurkat cells ( 32 ) .
It could therefore be possible that previously activated or memory T cells express a particular form of CD28 that is biased to mediate T cell activation without requirements for TCR/CD3 coengagement .
On the basis of this assumption , TCR-stimulated T cells should express a stimulatory CD28 molecule that can trigger activation when cross-linked by any CD28 mAb .
The observation that T cells preactivated by TCR triggering responded to both 9.3 and BW 828 stimulation ( Table I ) is in line with this concept .
In experiments using isolated T cell subsets we found that naive CD4 *CD45RA * T cells did not proliferate in response to sole CD28 stimulation , whereas previously activated/memory CD4~CD4SRO* T cells CD28-MEDIATED T CELL ACTIVATION WITHOUT TCR STIMULATION proliferated in response to stimulation with mAb BW 828 but not in response to stimulation with mAb 9.3 .
( 13 ) .
Thus , it is unlikely that CD28 molecules expressed on previously activated T cells in general have the capacity to induce T cell functions on their own .
If CD28-mediated activation occurs in vivo , it might be possible that particular binding properties and/or a high concentration of CD28 ligand ( s ) are required to induce critical configurational changes in CD28 resulting in the induction of stimulatory pathways .
Stimulation of the CD28 molecule without triggering of the TCR usually does not induce binding of transcription factors to the IL-2 promoter .
Therefore , it has been assumed that CD28 signals have to converge with TCR signals to activate transcription factors and induce cytokine gene transcription ( 12 , 34 ) .
This view of the signaling capacity of the CD28 molecule is in line with our ob-servation , that T cell stimulation with mAb 9.3 alone did not activate transcription factors , whereas stimulation with 9.3 plus OKT3 induced binding of proteins to the NF-AT , NF-KB , and CD28RE sites of the IL-2 promoter ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) .
The CD28-specific mAb BW 828 activated these transcription factors without requirement for TCR coengagement , strongly suggesting that CD28 can control T cell activation at the transcriptional level .
The individual steps of the signaling cascade leading to the activation of transcription factors by sole CD28 stimulation are not known .
Since BW 828 stimulation induced a particular pattern of early signaling events ( Figs .
2 and 3 ) the early steps of this putative pathway may differ from TCR/CD3 signals and CD28-mediated costimulatory signals .
An important downstream event of the signaling cascades that regulate the transcription factor NF-AT is the activation of the Jun kinases JNK1 and JNK2 , which are regarded as requiring TCR- as well as CD28-mediated signals for full activation ( 12 ) .
It remains to be established whether the potency of BW 828 to induce NF-AT results from the capacity of this mAb to fully activate JNK1 and JNK2 without further requirement for TCR signaling .
The data presented in this paper and recent observations from other researchers ( 14-16 ) suggest that stimulation of CD28 with mAbs or with the ligands CD80 and CD86 is not a neutral event but can activate T cells without further requirement for TCR stimulation .
Presently it is not clear whether this function of CD28 is operative in vivo .
If so , it might be possible that this type of activation plays a role in the regulation of lymphocyte homeostasis .
In T cells , CD28-mediated activation might control Ag-indepen-dent expansion of memory T cells ( 15 ) .
In the B cell compartment , elimination of irrelevant and/or potentially dangerous B cells could be regulated via T cell factors that are produced by CD28/CD86 interaction without TCR involvement ( 16 ) .
Further knowledge of the biochemical signaling events leading to T cell activation by sole CD28 stimulation could provide the basis for therapeutic inhibition or potentiation of this novel CD28 function .
