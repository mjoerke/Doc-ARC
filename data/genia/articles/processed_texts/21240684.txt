Samuel S. Chuang , Hoang-Tuan K. Pham , Pappanaicken R. Kumaresan , and Porunelloor A. Mathew The cell surface glycoprotein 2B4 ( CD244 ) of the Ig superfamily is involved in the regulation of NK and T lymphocyte functions .
We have recently identified CD48 as the high affinity counterreceptor for 2B4 in both mice and humans .
The cytoplasmic domain of 2B4 associates with sre homology 2 domain-containing protein or signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein , whose mutation is the underlying genetic defect in the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome .
In this study , we report the molecular cloning and characterization of the human 2B4 ( h2B4 ) promoter .
Through primer extension analysis , we found that the transcription of the £2B4 gene initiates at multiple start sites .
We isolated h2B4 genomic clones and PCR amplified the 5 ' untranslated region containing the promoter elements .
We have identified a functional AP-1 site that lies between ( -106 to -100 ) through transient transfection analysis in YT cells , a human NK cell line .
EMSAs with Abs specific for various protein factors of the AP-1 family revealed that multiple members of the Jun family are involved in the regulation of the £2B4 gene .
Mutation of the AP-1 site not only abolishes protein/DNA interactions but also promoter activity .
These results demonstrate a significant role for AP-1 in the transcriptional regulation of the £2B4 gene .
activation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( 1-3 ) .
2B4 was originally identified on mouse NK cells and the subset of T cells that mediate non-MHC-restricted killing ( 4-7 ) .
In addition to modulating non-MHC-restricted killing , 2B4 activation of NK cells induces cytokine production as well as invasiveness ( 4 , 8 ) .
It is a member of the Ig superfamily and belongs to the CD2 subset that includes signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule ( SLAM ) , CD48 , CD58 , CD84 , and Ly9 .
Human 2B4 ( h2B4 ) `` is found on all NK cells , a subset of CD8 * T cells , monocytes , and basophils ( 2 ) .
We have recently identified CD48 as the high affinity counterreceptor of 2B4 in both mice and humans ( 9 ) .
CD48-2B4 interactions are physiologically important because they enhance the lytic function of human NK cells ( 2 ) .
It has been reported that 2B4 may function as a coreceptor in human NK cell activation ( 10 ) .
It has been found that 2B4 associates with the signaling adapter molecule SLAM-associated protein ( SAP ) /Sre homology 2 domain-containing protein ( 11 ) .
Mutations in the Src homology 2 domain of SAP/Src homology 2 domain-containing protein have been identified as the genetic defect in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease ( XLPD ) , and a number of recent studies demonstrated that 2B4 signaling is defective in XLPD ( 12-17 ) .
Another study of XLPD patients showed that not only does 2B4 T he surface molecule 2B4 ( CD244 ) is implicated in the Department of Molecular Biology and Immunology and Institute for Cancer Re-search , University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth , Fort Worth , TX 76107 Received for publication September 1 , 2000 .

Furthermore , a recent report by Peritt et al .
demonstrated that the expression of 2B4 on CD8 * T cells is a better predictor of disease progression in AIDS patients than CD4 * T cell levels ( 19 ) .
Although no polymorphism has been reported in humans , our studies of 2B4 in inbred mouse strains demonstrate polymorphism in the extracellular domain ( 20 ) .
Over the last few years , a wealth of information has been accumulated on the identification , ligand interactions , and signaling pathways of several receptors expressed on NK cells .
However , knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of expression of these receptors is fragmentary .
To understand the transcriptional regulation as well as the mechanisms controlling the restricted expression of the 2B4 gene , we conducted preliminary analysis in characterizing the promoter of the mouse 2B4 ( m2B4 ) gene .
Our studies demonstrated that transcription of m2B4 did not start at a conserved initiation site and was driven by a TATA-less promoter ( 21 ) .
Moreover , transient transfections with fragments of the 2B4 promoter revealed cell-specific promoter activity in cells that express 2B4 only ( 21 ) .
This study was performed to understand the mechanisms that regulate the expression of the A2B4 gene .
To accomplish this , we isolated a genomic clone of h2B4 from a A phage library and identified > 1 kb of 5 ' flanking sequence of the h2B4 gene .
We undertook the task of characterizing the 5 ' flanking region of the h2B4 gene by constructing 5 ' nested deletion constructs and assayed their promoter activity by transient transfection of YT cells , a NK tumor cell line .
We present evidence that the presence of an AP-1 site located at -106 to -100 of the h2B4 promoter strongly activates transcription .

Partial sequencing of the genomic clones was performed by automated sequencing ( sequencing facility , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX ) using specific oligonucleotides based on h2B4 cDNA A19A1A ( 1 ) .
Nested promoter fragments were derived by PCR using Tag polymerase ( Promega ) and using genomic DNA clone ( F5A1 ) containing the 5 ' flanking sequence of the h2B4 gene as template ( 23 ) .
Various 5° 20-22 base primers were designed to incorporate a KpnI site for ease of subcloning .
The 3 ' primer , identical for all the constructs , was designed with a Xho !
site and ended at nucleotide +126 relative to the start of transcription ( Table 1 ) .
The nested promoter fragments were then cloned upstream of a promot-erless and enhancerless firefly luciferase gene in the pGL , -B vector ( Promega ) .

One of the genomic clones , F5A1 , contained a 5 ' flanking sequence relative to the h2B4 gene .
Approximately 1500 bases of the promoter region ( GenBank accession no .
AF297616 ) 5 `` to the h2B4 gene was amplified by using forward primer F5A1-FP and reverse primer F5A1-RP ( Fig .
1 ) .
The characterization of the genomic structure of h2B4 has already been reported ( 23 ) .
Transcription of the h2B4 gene is initiated at multiple start sites To identify the transcription initiation site of the gene , we performed primer extension using total RNA extracted from YT and NK92 cells .
We have shown previously that YT cells express h2B4 ( 8 ) .
We found through FACS analysis with C1.7 mAb ( a-h2B4 ) conjugated with FITC , that NK92 cells also express h2B4 ( data not shown ) .
Primer extension analysis using total RNA from YT cells revealed several extended extension products ( Fig .
2 ) .
Similar to the m2B4 gene , the h2B4 gene does not have a conserved initiation start site nor does it contain a TATA box near the transcription initiation start sites ( 21 ) .
Primer extension analysis repeated on total RNA extracted from NK92 cells produced identical extension products ( data not shown ) .

An h2B4 specific primer annealing to sequences downstream of the first base of the cDNA clone of h2B4 was annealed to 6 ug of YT total RNA .
The primer extension assay was conducted as described in Materials and Methods .
The same primer was used with an upstream primer to generate the G+A ladder as described previously ( 27 ) .
Arrows and numbers indicate the primer extension products resolved and their positions relative to the most 3 ' primer extension product designated as +1 .
transfection assays on YT cells .
A series of promoter mutants that contain successive deletions from the 5 ' end were inserted upstream of a firefly reporter gene within the pGL , , vector ( Fig .
34 ) .
It has been reported that YT cells are poor candidates for transient transfection ( 30 ) .
Transient cotransfection of various constructed promoter vectors and a Renilla luciferase CMV promoter-driven reporter plasmid using DMRIE-C reagent were conducted .
Using a ratio of 4.4 ug plasmid DNA to 6 ul DMRIE-C reagent , we were able to achieve 2.5-4 % transfection efficiency , enough to observe measurable luciferase activity .
The firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was then measured 40 h posttransfection .
Transient transfections of these 5 ' deletion promoter constructs into YT cells revealed several important regions of the 2B4 promoter that regulate transcription .
Promoter regions ( - 188 to -80 ) and ( -852 to -704 ) were identified to have a positive effect on transcription , whereas the promoter regions ( -414 to -342 ) and ( -704 to -505 ) had a negative effect .
Transfections conducted revealed that maximal luciferase activity was achieved with the promoter fragment ( p-342 ) produced luciferase activity that was almost 4-fold higher than the smallest promoter fragment ( p-80 ) , which we designated a luciferase activity value of 1 ( Fig .
3B ) .
When the promoter fragment was reduced further from ( -188 to -88 ) relative to the start of transcription , there was a significant reduction of activity by 72 % ( p < 0.001 ) .
These results reveal that the DNA sequences between -188 and +126 are sufficient for strong promoter activity in YT cells and that at least one essential DNA binding element is located within the -188 to -80 region of the h2B4 promoter .
Identification of an AP-1 binding site Sequence analysis of the DNA sequence that lies between -188 and -80 relative to the start of transcription reveals a consensus binding site for AP-1 .
To determine the relevance of this element , we performed EMSAs with nuclear protein extracts from YT and NK-92 cells .
We used double-stranded oligonucleotides coding for 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology A [ Turiferase ___ ] p-l151 -- - kii Luciferase ___ ] p # 52 enemee mm __ L1 CifOC25E p-704 mmm 9505 -- - Pndfaass _- p44 -- _- » 42 -U sig o TJ Relative Luciferase Activity p-l115 p-852 p-704 p-505 p4l4 p-342 p-188 - p-80 Plasmid Constructs Transfected FIGURE 3 .

The normalized firefly luciferase activity expressed in YT cells transfected with the p-80 construct was assigned a value of 1. the promoter sequence ( -111 to -89 ) radiolabeled with [ y- `` P ] -dATP as probes in EMSAs .
Using nuclear protein extracts from NK92 cells in the DNA binding reactions showed multiple protein-DNA complexes ( Fig .
4 ) .
However , when unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides coding for the promoter sequence ( -111 to -89 ) and for the consensus DNA binding sequence for AP-1 were used as cold competitors at 100- and 200-fold excess to the amount of labeled probe used , only one band was competed away .
One hundred and two hundred molar excess amounts of unlabeled custom synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides coding for the consensus DNA binding sequence for NF- « B and coding for the h2B4 promoter sequence spanning -111 to -89 with the mutated AP-1 binding site as ( TGeegCA ) were added to the DNA binding reactions .
The specific protein-DNA complex failed to be competed away by these competitors respectively ( Fig .
4 ) .
EMSAs conducted in identical fashion using nuclear protein extracts from YT cells produced very similar results ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that the upper protein-DNA binding complex is specific .
To determine the identities of the protein-bound fraction involved in the upper protein-DNA complex , we conducted the DNA binding reactions with nuclear protein extracts from NK92 cells in the presence of a panel of Abs .
In the presence of Abs specific for c-Jun and JunB , the presence of a supershifted protein DNA complex was observed ( Fig .
5 and data not shown ) .
However , when an isotype control Ab ( 22B5 ) was used , no detectable additional band or any change in the presence of the other protein-DNA complexes 6191 Competitors : & ® wt _ AP-1 NF—KF Mu ?

The c-Fos family is often associated with the Jun family of proteins to form the AP-1 protein complex ( 31 ) .
When we incubated anti-c-Fos Ab in the DNA binding reactions , we observed the presence of the specific upper protein-DNA complex severely diminished .
Instead , the anti-c-Fos Ab has clearly shifted the band ( Fig .
5 ) .
Thus , Ab-mediated supershift analysis in EMSAs indicate that AP-1 interacts with the h2B4 promoter and that there may be multiple forms of AP-1 involved in the transcription regulation of the A2B4 gene .
To verify the constitutive expression of AP-1 in human NK cells , we isolated untouched human primary cells from the PBMCs of healthy adult donors by cell exclusion using a human NK cell isolation kit ( Miltenyi Biotec ) .
Nuclear protein extracts were generated from the isolated cells and used in EMSAs using double-stranded oligonucleotides coding for the promoter sequence ( -111 to -89 ) radiolabeled with [ y- `` °P ] dATP as probe ( Fig .
6 ) .
The presence of DNA-protein complex suggests that AP-1 in the nuclear extracts of primary human NK cells interacts with h2B4 promoter .
Ab-mediated supershift analysis using anti-c-Jun , anti-JunB , and anti-c-Fos further confirmed that AP-1 in nuclear extracts from primary NK cells interacts with the h2B4 promoter .
The AP-1 site ( -106 to -100 ) regulates the h2B4 promoter Upon the determination of AP-1 binding to the promoter sequence within the -111 to -89 sequence of the h2B4 promoter and the identification of the consensus DNA binding site sequence for AP-1 within this sequence , we wanted to examine the functional role of AP-1 in the transcription of the A2B4 gene .
To this end , we synthesized two complementary oligonucleotides that code for the promoter sequence within the -111 to -89 sequence of the h2B4 promoter with the AP-1 binding site mutated from TGAGTCA to TGeegCA .
These oligonucleotides were annealed and radiolabeled with [ y-°P ] dATP to form a double-stranded EMSA probe .

To assess the functional significance of AP-1 DNA binding site in the h2B4 promoter , we synthesized mutant promoter constructs ( p-M188 and p-M342 ) using the oligonucleotides outlined above and using the p-188 and p-342 as templates in multiple rounds of PCR ( as described in Materials and Methods ) , respectively ( Fig .
7B ) .
Transient transfections with the mutant promoter constructs revealed the mutation of the AP-1 site significantly reduced luciferase activity ( p < 0.001 ) of both constructs ( Fig .
7C ) .
The data suggest that AP-1 regulates the transcription of the h2B4 gene .
Discussion In this study we have cloned the h2B4 promoter region and identified a significant role for AP-1 in the transcriptional regulation of the k2B4 gene .
The expression of h2B4 has been found on all human NK cells , a subset of CD8 * T cells , monocytes , and basophils ( 2 ) .
In an effort to identify cis- and trans-acting factors that can regulate the h2B4 promoter , we isolated a genomic clone that contained the 5 ' flanking region of the gene .
To identify those regions in the promoter that play a role in regulating the transcription of the A2B4 gene , 5 ' nested deletion constructs were created and inserted in a forward orientation in front of a firefly luciferase reporter gene .
Transient transfection analysis revealed the presence of the region ( - 188 to -80 ) had a 3.5-fold positive effect on transcription over the minimal promoter ( -80 to +126 ) ( Fig .
3B ) .
Several other regions may also play a role in regulating the transcription of the A2B4 gene ( Fig .
8 ) .
Within the -188 to -80 region of the h2B4 promoter is a putative AP-1 DNA binding site that matches the consensus binding site for AP-1 .
Comparison to the 5 ' flanking sequence of the m2B4 promoter shows a striking resemblance .
There is a putative AP-1 binding site in the m2B4 promoter whose location is similar relative to the multiple initiation start sites as we have found in the h2B4 promoter .
The presence of the mouse AP-1 site also had a significant positive effect on transcription activity ( 21 ) .
In an effort to show that AP-1 interacts with the -188 to -80 site , we performed EMSAs using nuclear protein extracts from YT N.S .

and NK-92 cells and labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides coding for the -111 to -89 region of the h2B4 promoter in the presence of various specific and nonspecific unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors .
As we expected , only those competitors that contained an AP-1 binding site were able to compete away the protein DNA complex as shown in Fig .
4 .
Additionally , heat treatment of nuclear protein extract from either YT or NK92 cells at 85°C for 5 min abolished the specific protein-DNA complex ( data not shown ) .
To identify whether the protein within the specific protein/DNA complex was in fact AP-1 , we conducted supershift assays with Abs that were specific to various members of the Jun and Fos families .
The AP-1 transcription factor consists of heterodimers between members of the Jun and Fos families of proteins .
Interestingly , both Abs specific for c-Jun and JunB partially supershifted the protein/DNA complex .
Ab specific for the Fos family supershifted the entire protein/DNA complex ( Fig .
4 ) .
Similar results were observed when we used nuclear protein extracts from isolated human primary NK cells from peripheral blood ( Fig .
6 ) .
Thus , it appears that there are multiple AP-1 complexes that may bind the h2B4 promoter .
Activation of the MAP kinase pathways ( c-Jun N-terminal kinase , MAP/extracellular signal-related kinase kinase , extracellular signal-related kinase ) not only controls the overall levels of Jun and Fos proteins , but also leads to the phosphorylation states necessary for transcriptional activity ( 32 ) .
Thus , transcription of the h2B4 gene may be regulated by the various signaling pathways that can stimulate the various MAP kinase pathways .
The significance of initiation of transcription at multiple transcription start sites ( Fig .
2 ) is not known .
It has been shown that there are multiple splice variants of 2B4 in both mice and human ( 18 , 23 , 33 ) .
Characterization of the genomic structure of h2B4 revealed that the different transcripts are derived from a single 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology A B 6193 @ < & < AP-1 binding site 600 % 0 60 x 1—11 , GAGTCA x r ceg chifzrzzz pM ?

gene ( 23 ) .
Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that the multiple transcription initiation sites present in the A2B4 gene promoter may have a role in the production of different splice variants .
In the mouse , the splice variants give rise to different isoforms of 2B4 that display opposing signals to NK cells ( 33 , 34 ) .
However , the functional roles of h2B4 splice variants are not known ( 18 , 23 ) .
It is possible that the multiple transcription start sites present in the h2B4 promoter may be differentially used under different conditions of activation of NK cells .
The cytoplasmic tail of h2B4 contains four novel tyrosine-based motifs ( 1 ) .
These motifs are similar to those found on other CD2 subfamily members including SLAM , Ly9 , CS1 , and CD84 ( 35-38 ) and have been shown to interact with protein tyrosine phos-phatase , SHP-2 and the Src homology-2 domain containing adaptor molecule , SAP ( 14 , 35 ) .
Mutations in SAP have been identified as the genetic defect in XLPD ( 14 ) .
Although h2B4 on the NK cells of these patients are normal , 2B4 could not interact with the mutant SAP ( 18 ) .
Immunoprecipitations of h2B4 from NK cells from these patients coprecipitated SHP-1 .
This is contrary to previous reports that showed SHP-2 , not SHP-1 is able to associate with the h2B4 cytoplasmic tail ( 10 ) .
Additionally , h2B4 has been found to localize to the glycolipid-enriched microdomains and to associate with another adaptor molecule , linker for activation of T cells ( 39 , 40 ) .
Linker for activation of T cells has been found to be constitutively associated to 2B4 , and that engagement of 2B4 results in the recruitment of other signaling molecules including phospholipase Cy and Grb2 ( 40 ) .
Recently , it has also been shown that 2B4 signaling can be regulated by NK inhibitory receptors engaged by their MHC class I ligands on resistant cells ( 41 ) .
This is caused by the recruitment of SHP-1 , which blocks phosphory- lation of the 2B4 cytoplasmic tail .
Although our understanding of the signaling pathway ( s ) h2B4 uses to increase cytolytic activity and cytokine release is incomplete , there is evidence that transcriptional events are necessary for NK cell cytotoxicity .
A recent study found NK cell treatment of inhibitors of the AP-1 pathway prevented natural cytotoxicity of susceptible target tumor cells by NK cells ( 42 ) .
We have found that h2B4 stimulation of NK cells triggers many events that may be controlled through transcription , including an increase in transcription of IFN-y and MMP-2 ( 8 , 43 ) .
We have identified and begun to characterize the h2B4 , which modulates NK cell functions ( 1 , 8 ) .
It would be very interesting to investigate the role that AP-1 may play in the signal transduction pathway of h2B4 in NK cells .
AP-1 has been found to transcrip-tionally regulate many immune response genes including IFN-y ( 44 , 45 ) , IL-3 ( 46 ) , granzyme B ( 47 ) , IL-2 ( 48 , 49 ) , IL-5 ( 50 ) , and now A2B4 .
Many studies done on various NK cell stimulation pathways have found involvement of AP-1 and the MAP kinase pathways ( 50-59 ) .
Thus it appears that AP-1 may play a major role in the signaling activation of NK cells and that h2B4 gene -1115 -852 - -704 -505 -414 -342 -188 -80 +|_l > [ -T OH ~~ | | _+ +126 FIGURE 8 .
