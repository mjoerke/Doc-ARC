Ali Khoshnan , David Bae , `` Charles A. Tindell , and Andre E. NeP We investigated the role of protein kinase C 0 ( PKC0O ) in the activation of the cascade in primary human CD4* lymphocytes .
Among six or so PKC isoforms expressed in T cells , only PKC O participates in the assembly of the supramolecular activation clusters at the contact site of the TCR with Ag .
Signaling via both the TCR and CD28 is required for optimal activation of the multisubunit IB kinase ( IKK ) complex in primary human T lymphocytes ; this activation could be inhibited by a Ca**-independent PKC isoform inhibitor , rottlerin .
Moreover , endogenous PKC O physically associates with activated IKK complexes in CD3/CD28-costimulated primary CD4* T cells .
The same set of stimuli also induced relocation of endogenous PKCO and IKKs to a GM1 ganglioside-enriched , detergent-insoluble membrane compartment in primary T cells .
IKKs recruited to these lipid rafts were capable of phosphorylating a recombinant IxBa sustrate .
Confocal microscopy further demonstrated that exogenously expressed PKC O0 and IKK colocalize in the membrane of CD3/CD28-costimulated Jurkat T cells .
Constitutively active but not kinase-inactive PKCO activated IKK $ in Jurkat T cells .
Expression of dominant-active PKCO also had stimulatory effects on the CD28 response element of the IL-2 promoter .
Taken together , these data show that the activation of PKC by the TCR and CD28 plays an important role in the assembly and activation of IKK complexes in the T cell membrane .

D28 is a key accessory receptor that enhances cellular ac tivation via the TCR .
Not only is CD28 an integral compo- nent of the supramolecular activation clusters ( SMAC ) that assemble at the TCR contact site with the APC , but it also plays an active role in the recruitment of signaling molecules to the TCR ( 1-5 ) .
The latter effect is mediated by the coclustering of lipid rafts to the TCR synapse .
Lipid rafts are detergent-resistant , cholesterol and gly-cosphingolipid-enriched membrane domains which contain proteins that contribute to signal transduction ( 6 ) .
These rafts also include signaling molecules belonging to the src-family , LAT ( linker for activation of T cells ) and Ras ( 1 , 4 , 6 ) .
Through this action , CD28 enhances signal transduction by the TCR , including engagement of signaling pathways that can not be activated by TCR alone .
One example is activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) cascade and another engagement of the NF-kB pathway ( 7 , 8 ) .

Copyright © 2000 by The American Association of Immunologists be functionally linked through the action of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase ( MAPKKK ) , MEKK1 , which induces JNK as well as inhibitor of xB factor ( IB ) kinase ( IKK ) $ B activity during CD28 coligation ( 7-10 ) .
Both cascades are critical for the activation of the IL-2 gene , including activation of the CD28 response element ( RE ) in the promoter of that gene ( 7 , 11 , 12 ) .
This composite RE , which includes c-Rel and AP-1 binding sites , is activated in a synergistic fashion by the NF-KB and JNK cascades during TCR/CD28 coligation ( 7 , 13 ) .
Although the mechanism of NF-KB activation by the TCR/CD28 is unclear , we have recently shown that CD28 synergizes with TCR in the activation of homo- and heterodimeric IKK complexes in primary human T cells ( 8 ) .
Activated IKKs phosphor-ylate the inhibitory proteins , IxBa and IBB , leading to their degradation and release of NF-KB transcription factors into the nucleus ( 8 , 14 , 15 ) .
IKKa , IKK , and IKK y are the core components of a 700- to 900-kDa multimolecular kinase complex , which is responsible for stimulus-induced phosphorylation of IkBs ( 16-22 ) .
Although proteins like MEKK1 and the NF- « B-inducing kinase have been shown to associate with the IKKs , there is considerable debate as to whether these are functionally involved in the regulation of IKK activity ( 18 , 23 , 24 ) .
In addition , two other serine-threonine kinases , namely Cot kinase and protein kinase C 0 ( PKCO ) , have now been implicated in IKK activation by CD3/CD28 ( 25-28 ) .
Whether these kinases are involved in individual signaling pathways or act in hierarchical fashion is still uncertain .
In this com-munication , we will focus on PKCO because this is the only PKC isoform that is recruited to the TCR synapse and the SMAC ( 1 , 5 , 29 , 30 ) .
Moreover , PKC has been shown to be involved in NF-kB activation in T lymphocytes , in addition to its ability to induce the JNK/AP-1 pathway ( 6 , 26-28 , 31-33 ) .
This suggests that PKCO plays a key role in the regulation of signaling cascades influenced by CD28 receptor .
0022-1767/00/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG 6934 Because activated PKCO is recruited to the T cell membrane , it is possible that IKK activation may commence in a signalsome that assembles at the TCR synapse .
We demonstrate that CD3/CD28 coligation in primary human T lymphocytes induces relocation of endogenous PKCO as well as IKKs to a GM1 ganglioside-enriched , detergent-insoluble membrane compartment that overlaps with lipid rafts .
IKKs recruited to lipid rafts were actively capable of phosphorylating the recombinant IkBa in vitro .
Although exogenously expressed PKC induced IKK activity in Jurkat cells , it was also possible to show that endogenous PKCO associated with activated IKK complexes in primary human CD4* T cells .
Expression of dominant-active ( DA ) and dominant-negative ( DN ) PKCO had stimulatory and inhibitory effects , respectively , on the CD28RE .
Taken together , these data suggest that activation of PKCO by TCR and CD28 plays an important role in the assembly and activation of IKK complexes in the T cell membrane .

Membranes were sequentially overlaid with the indicated concentrations of the primary Abs , followed by a 1:2000 dilution of the secondary HRP-conjugated Ab .
PKCQ-INDUCED IKK ACTIVATION IN MEMBRANE RAFTS Cellular fractionation into detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble material Cellular fractionation was performed as previously described ( 36 ) .
Briefly , 1 X 10° primary CD4* cells were suspended for 15 min in hypotonic buffer E ( 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 10 mM KCI , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM PMSF , 1 mM sodium vanadate , 10 pg/ml leupeptin , and 0.01 TIU/ml aprotonin ) , then lysed with 50 mechanical strokes in a Dounce homoge-nizer .
Lysates were spun for 30 min at 100,000 X g , and the supernatant , designated cytosol , was collected .
The pellet was rinsed twice in buffer E and resuspended in buffer E , containing 1 % Nonidet P-40 for 30 min .
Samples were recentrifuged at 100,000 X g , and the supernatant , designated detergent-soluble material ( DSM ) , was collected ( 33 ) .
The remaining pellet was rinsed once in buffer E plus detergent , followed by sonication in RIPA buffer ( 20 mM Tris ( pH 7.5 ) , 250 mM NaCl , 10 mM DTT , 10 mM MgCl , , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.1 % SDS , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate ) , and cleared by centrifugation as described above .
This supernatant was designated detergent insoluble material ( DIM ) ( 36 ) .
Sucrose gradient fractionation Aliquots of 1 X 10° Jurkat or primary human CD4* lymphocytes stimulated or unstimulated were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold MBS ( 25 mM MES pH6.5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0.5 % Triton X-100 , 1 mM Na , ; VO , , 1 mM PMSF , and 10 pg/ml aprotinin ) .
Lysates were homogenized using 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer , mixed with an equal volume of 85 % sucrose ( w/v ) in MBS , and transferred to a SW41 centrifuge tube .
The mixture was first overlaid with 6 ml of 35 % sucrose , then 3 ml of 5 % sucrose in MBS with 1 mM Na , VO , , and centrifuged at 200,000 x g for 16 h at 4°C .
Following centrifugation , eleven 1-ml fractions were sequentially collected from the top of the centrifuge tube .
The low-density fractions ( i.e .
, fractions 2-4 ) contained lipid raft material , whereas cytosolic material and soluble membranes were predominantly recovered in fractions 9-11 .
Primary human CD4* T cells were similarly processed , except cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 mAb coupled to magnetic beads .
GMI ganglioside staining To determine the efficiency of the isolation of lipid rafts via sucrose gradient centrifugation , 2 wl of each fraction was dot blotted onto Immobilon-P Nitrocellulose Transfer membrane ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) .
After drying , the membrane was blocked in 6 % BSA for 1 h at room temperature and washed once in PBS with 0.1 % Tween 20 ( PBS-T ) .
HRP-linked cholera toxin B subunit ( Sigma ) was diluted in PBS-T to 4.2 ug/ul and was used to overlay the membrane for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times , incubated with SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , and subjected to autoradiography .
Immune complex kinase assays A total of 10 `` Jurkat or resting CD4 * T cells in 1 ml of RPMI were either unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 + CD28 mAb as described above ( 8 ) .
For the effects of PKC inhibitors on IKK activity , CD4 * T cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of these drugs for 1 h before stimulation .
Two hundred microgram lysate was incubated with 2 pg anti-IKKy Ab , adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. In vitro kinase assays using GST-IxB ( 1-55 ) as substrate were performed as previously described ( 8 , 17 ) .
Luciferase assays A total of 10 `` Jurkat cells were transfected with 10 ug of the consensus NF-KB or CD28RE luciferase ( Luc ) reporters in the absence or presence of one of the following constructs : wt-PKCO , DA-PKCO , or DN-PKCO .
In separate experiments , CD28RE Luc reporter was coexpressed with DA-PKCO and either DN-IKK $ or DN-IKKa .
Cells were rested for 24 h and then stimulated for 6 h with anti-CD3 + CD28 mAb or P + I. Luciferase assays were performed as previously described ( 8 ) .
Transfection efficiency was monitored by - cotransfection of a - B-galactosidase plasmid ( CMV-B-gal ) .
Confocal microscopy Jurkat T cells were transfected with 10 ug of Flag-IKKB plus 10 ug of wt PKC0O by electroporation as described .
( 35 ) .
Cells were rested for 24 h and stimulated for 1 h with anti-CD3 + CD28 mAb coupled to magnetic beads , at a ratio of 4 beads/cell ( 34 ) .
Cells were vigorously resuspended and the magnetic beads were removed .
In a separate experiment , Jurkat T cells transfected with Flag-IKKB and DA-PKCO were used without any stimu-lations .
Cells spun onto a glass slide were fixed in 4 % glutaraldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized in 70 % methanol for 1 h. Slides were overlaid 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG The Journal of Immunology with 5 pg/ml goat anti-PKC0O for 2 h. After washing in PBS ( three times ) , slides were treated with 5 ug/ml of PE-conjugated anti-goat plus 5 ug/ml FITC-conjugated anti-Flag for 2 h. Appropriate controls consisted of omitting the primary Abs to rule out nonspecific binding of the secondary reagent .
Samples were washed extensively and examined under a LEICA inverted TCS-SP confocal microscope , using a X100 objective lens .
Results PKCO plays a role in CD3/CD28-induced activation of IKKs in primary human CD4 * T lymphocytes as well as Jurkat cells We have previously shown that CD28 costimulation is essential for the activation of heterogeneous IKK complexes , as well as activation of the IL-2 promoter ( 8 ) .
We focused on the role of PKC0 , because this is the only PKC isoform that is recruited to the TCR ( 29 , 30 ) .
Moreover , it was recently demonstrated by the cellular transfection approach that PKC plays a role in the activation of the IKKs in Jurkat cells ( 26 , 27 ) .
To demonstrate the relevance of these findings in NF-KB activation in primary human CD4¢* T cells , we examined the effect of PKC inhibitors on IKK activation during CD28 costimulation ( Fig .
1 ) .
As previously shown , CD3/ CD28 coligation but not anti-CD3 alone , induced IKK activation ( Fig .
1 , lanes 1-3 ) .
Rottlerin , a Ca** -independent PKC isoform inhibitor , interfered in IKK activation ( lanes 4-6 ) , whereas G66976 , a Ca2+—dependent PKC isoform inhibitor , had no effect ( lanes 7-9 ) .
Similar findings were made in Jurkat cells ( data not shown ) .
These data suggest that Ca* * -independent PKCs participate in the activation of IKK complexes by the TCR .
These data do not rule out the role of other PKC isoforms in NF-kB pathway activation , e.g .
, stimulation by cytokines .
Because PKCOQ has been implicated in CD28 costimulatory events ( 29 , 32 ) , we examined whether this PKC isoform physically associates with the IKK signalsome .
PKC immune precipitates were analyzed for the presence of IKK subunits by Western blotting .
Compared with resting CD4 * T cells , which did not show any association between these proteins , a small amount of IKK coprecipitated with PKCO in anti-CD3-treated cells ( Fig .
24 ) .
The amount of IKK coprecipitaiton was dramatically increased by CD28 costimulation ( lane 4 ) , which is in agreement with the key role of this receptor in IKK activation ( Fig .
1 ) .
To show the spec-ificity of PKCQO in this costimulatory event , we also performed an analysis in which we compared PKCO with PKCa immune complexes .
As shown in Fig .
2B , both IKKa and IKK B coprecipitated with PKCO in anti-CD3 + CD28 or P + I-stimulated CD4~* T cells .
In contrast , PKCa immune complexes did not contain any IKKs under resting or stimulated conditions ( Fig .
24 ) , showing a specific role for PKCO in CD3/CD28-induced NF-KB activation ( 26 , 27 ) .

PKCO interacts with activated IKK complexes in primary CD4* T cells .
A , Coimmunoprecipitation of PKCO and IKK $ B .
Two hundred micrograms of cleared lysate from resting and stimulated T cells were incubated with 2 ug of anti-PKCO mAb bound to protein A beads for 3 h. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes .
The membrane was overlaid with anti-IKK B ( 1:250 ) and anti-PKCO ( 1:1000 ) , followed by HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse ( 1 ; 2000 antiserum .
B , Same as in A , except that parallel immunoprecipitation was performed with 2 ug anti-PKCa Ab .
The membranes were overlaid with anti-PKCO ( 1:1000 ) , anti-PKCa ( 1:1000 ) , anti-IKKa ( 1:1000 ) , and anti-IKKB ( 1:250 ) as indicated .
The reduced amount of PKCO in lane 2 was not due to a decreased amount of cellular protein , but is the result of steric hindrance by an unknown mechanism in the lysates from unstimulated cells ( also see lane 2 in A ) .
This effect was negated by inclusion of a small amount of SDS in the lysis buffer , but could not be used for co-precipitation analysis .
C , Same as in B , except IKK complexes were immune precipitated with anti-IKKa before immunoblotting with a goat-anti PKC Ab ( 1:1000 ) .
D , In vitro kinase assay on PKCa and PKCO immu-noprecipitates .
The same immune complexes as in B were incubated with 2 ug of GST-IkBa ( 1-55 ) and 10 wCi [ y- `` °P ] ATP .
Kinase assays were conducted as described in Fig .
1. could be seen to coprecipitate with PKCQ in CD3 + CD28 or P + I-treated cells ( Fig .
2C ) .
Parallel in vitro kinase assays showed that PKC was associated with active IKK complexes capable of phosphorylating the substrate , IkBa ( Fig .
2D ) .
In contrast , anti-PKCa 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG 6936 precipitates were not associated with active IKK complexes ( Fig .
2D ) .
Taken together , these data show that PKCO associates with a complex that also includes activated IKKs in CD3/CD28-stimu-lated T cells .
Although we do not know whether this is a direct interaction or an indirect association via intermediary components in a macromolecular complex , other workers have failed to show a direct interaction of PKC with IKKs ( 27 ) .
In an extension of these studies in Jurkat cells , we asked whether coexpression of wt , DA- , or DN-PKCO with epitope-tagged IKKs could induce IKK activity .
Although DA-PKCO induced IKKB activity , no activation was obtained with wt or DN-PKCO ( Fig .
3 , top ) .
HA-IKKB was equally expressed in these samples ( Fig .
3 , middle ) .
Blotting for PKC confirmed overexpression of wt , DA- , and DN-PKCO ( Fig .
3 , bottom ) .
In contrast , a parallel experiment using Flag-IKKa cotransfection failed to show an effect of PKCO on IKKa activity ( data not shown ) .
This is in agreement with the findings of Lin et al .
( 27 ) who showed that DA-PKCQ induced the phosphorylation of coexpressed IKK B but not IKKa .
Taken together , the above data show that PKCO plays a key role in IKK activation in primary human CD4 * lymphocytes as well as in overexpressing Jurkat cells .
Evidence that PKCO is involved in the activation of the CD28RE A biologically relevant target for the CD28 accessory receptor is the IL-2 gene , in particular the CD28RE in the promoter of that gene ( 7 , 13 ) .
We have recently shown that IKK/B , but not IKKa , contributes to the activation of that RE during CD3/CD28 costimulation ( 7 , 8 ) .
The importance of PKCQ in the activation of that RE was confirmed by the use of wt , DA- , or DN-PKCO , which were equally expressed in Jurkat cells together with a CD28RE-Luc reporter ( Fig .
4A ) .
Although the response of this reporter was minimally affected by wt-PKCO , DA-PKCO itself was sufficient in CD28RE activation ( Fig .
4B ) .
This activity was further enhanced by CD3 + CD28 or P + I costimulation ( Fig .
4B ) .
In contrast , DN-PKCO interfered in CD28RE activation ( Fig .
4B ) .
Similar inhibitory effects on CD28RE activation were obtained with rottlerin , but not G66976 ( Fig .
4C ) .
To demonstrate that the IKKs function downstream of PKCO in the activation of that RE , we used DN-IKKa and DN IKK cotransfection with DA-PKCO .
Although DN-IKK/ interfered in the DA-PKCO-induced response , DN-IKKa had minimal effects on CD28RE-Luc activity ( Fig .
4D ) .

After resting for 24 h , cells were lysed , and 200 ug cleared lysate was immunoprecipitated with 2 ug anti-HA mAb bound to protein A-Sepharose beads .
The immunoprecipitates were washed , equilibrated in kinase buffer , and incubated with 3 ug GST-IxBa ( 1-55 ) and 10 wCi [ y- `` `` P ] JATP .
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE , followed by autoradiography ( upper panel ) .
Aliquots of the lysates were also transferred to immunoblotting membranes , which were overlaid with 1:1000 anti-HA mAb ( middle panel ) or anti-PKCO Ab ( bot-tom panel ) .
Blots were developed as described in Fig .

PKCO overexpression can be seen as increased staining intensity in lanes 2-4 compared with the endogenous protein in lane I. PKCQ-INDUCED IKK ACTIVATION IN MEMBRANE RAFTS These findings are in agreement with the ability of DA-PKCO to induce IKK , but not IKKa , activation under cotransfection conditions ( Fig .
3 ) .
PKCO relocates to a detergent-resistant membrane compartment together with talin and IKKs Because PKCO is recruited to the signal assembly complex at the TCR ( 29 , 30 ) , it raised the question whether IKKs and their associated components are also recruited to that membrane site .
We have previously shown that TCR ligation leads to the translocation of several signaling components , including the { -chain of the TCR , cytoskeletal components , p56 `` , p36 ( LAT ) , PLC-y , , and ZAP-70 to DSM and DIM ( 36 ) .
Interestingly , the same signaling molecules are recruited to the SMAC , where PKCO localizes in the center cluster , whereas talin appears in the peripheral zone ( 29 , 30 ) .
Talin is a member of the cytoskeletal complex that assembles at the TCR synapse ( 37 ) .
To determine whether PKCO and talin are core-cruited to the DIM , we fractionated primary human CD4* T cells into cytosolic DSM and DIM components .
Western blot analysis showed talin relocation from the cytosol to the DIM during CD3 + CD28 or P + I , and , to a lesser extent , anti-CD3 stimulation ( Fig .
5A ) .
Although endogenous PKCO underwent similar redistribution to the DIM during CD3 + CD28 or P + I stimulation ( Fig .
3 ) , this kinase also relocated to the DSM under these stimulatory conditions ( Fig .

In a related set of experiments , we also asked whether IKK components relocate to these cellular fractions .
IKKa , IKK B , and IKK y were recruited to the DIM , and to a variable degree the DSM , during cellular stimulation with anti-CD3 + CD28 or P + I ( Fig .
5B ) .
Recently , it has been shown that lipid rafts are important in controlling the assembly of signaling molecules at the TCR synapse .
Moreover , co-cross-linking of the CD28 receptor enhances the clustering of lipid rafts at the TCR synapse , thereby enhancing TCR signaling ( 1 , 5 , 38 ) .
Lipid rafts are defined by their insolubility in cold , nonionic detergents , unlike the bulk of the cell membrane .
Because this suggests that DIM may overlap with lipid rafts , we used sucrose density fractionation to prepare raft fractions from unstimulated and anti-CD3 + CD28-treated Jurkat cells .
Using the cholera toxin B-subunit to identify the fractions containing GMI ganglioside , we showed that lipid rafts were mostly present in the hypodense layers ( fractions 3-5 ) from resting as well as stimulated T cells ( Fig .
64 ) .
Immunoblotting showed PKCQ and talin recruitment to the hypodense fractions during cellular stimulation ( Fig .
6B ) .
Although PKCO and talin did not appear in the low density fractions from unstimulated cells , these fractions did show the con-stitutive presence of Lck , which was further increased by CD3 + CD28 costimulation ( Fig .
6B ) .
Moreover , Western blotting for IKK and IKKa showed their relocation to lipid rafts in CD3 + CD28-treated cells ( Fig .
6B ) .
Taken together , these data indicate that IKK components are recruited to lipid rafts in parallel with PKCO and talin .
Presence of active IKK complexes in lipid rafts from primary human CD4* T cells Although for logistic reasons the entire experiment in Fig .
6B could not be repeated in primary CD4 * T cells , we did perform sucrose gradient fractionation on CD3 + CD28-stimulated primary T cells .
As for Jurkat cells , the lipid rafts were identified by cholera toxin staining and shown to reside in fractions 3-5 .
Immunoblotting showed the presence of IKKs in these low density fractions , in addition to their presence in the DSM ( fractions 10 and 11 ; Fig .
6C ) .
Moreover , immune precipitation with anti-IKKy and performance of in vitro kinase assays showed the presence of activated IKK complexes in fractions 2-4 as well as 10 and 11 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG The Journal of Immunology A Jurkat - Exogenous PKCB CC A % maul UT wt DA DN -- < p 1 20 3 4 B 300000 7 C ] Control 458 I3 acbsrcb2s | mops 200000 7 100000 7 Luciferase Activity in Light Units PKC 0 Constructs 20 7 C Jurkat C ] Control 2 acD3/aCD2s 2 ~ 5 s < +-g 15 4 © § £ e 3 £ 10 { @ @ & £ 0 £ C 3 5 u .

These findings indicate that lipid rafts from CD3/CD28 costimulated T cells contain activated IKK complexes .
Similar results were obtained in Jurkat T cells .
Exogenously expressed PKCOQ and IKKB relocate and colocalize in the membranes of Jurkat T cells To confirm the recruitment of PKCO and IKKs to the membranes , we used confocal microscopy .
Exogenously transfected wt-PKCO and Flag-IKK 3 were expressed in a diffuse manner in unstimulated cells ( Fig .

However , upon stimulation with anti-CD3 + CD28-conjugated beads , both PKCO and IKKB were redistributed to membrane cap sites ( Fig .

Overlay of the green ( IKK ) and red ( PKCO ) images yielded a composite yellow fluorescent pattern , which indicates colocalization of these proteins in the membrane cap sites of stimulated cells ( Fig .

When cotransfected with DA-PKCO , Flag-IKKB colocalized in the membrane in a diffuse distribution without the need for cellular stimulation ( Fig .

Recruitment of PKC0 , talin , and IKKa to lipid rafts .
A , 10° Jurkat T cells were used for control and anti-CD3 + CD28-stimulated samples .
Each sample was separated into 11 fractions after being subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation as described in the Materials and Methods .
Fractions 2-4 contain low density lipid rafts , whereas fractions 9-11 contain cytosolic and soluble membrane material .
Two microliters of each fraction were dot-blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane and treated with HRP -linked cholera toxin B subunit to detect the ganglioside GM1 as described in the Materials and Methods .
B , Equal cellular amounts ( 60 l ) of fractions 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 10 , and 11 were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and processed for Western blotting for PKCO , talin IKKa , IKKB , and Lok using 1:1000 dilution of the primary Abs .
C , Primary human CD4* T cells were expanded by magnetic beads coupled to anti-CD3/CD28 Abs .
A total of 1 X 10° proliferating cells were processed for lipid raft separation as described in A .

Lower panel demonstrates the activity of IKKs recruited to the lipid rafts .
Kinase activity was examined on anti-IKK y immunoprecipitates as described in the legend of Fig .

These data suggest that PKCO activity is involved in the membrane recruitment of the IKK signalsome , which is also consistent with coimmunoprecipitation studies shown in Fig .
2 .
In accordance with this notion , DN-PKCO resides in the cytosol of unstimulated cells , similar to wt-PKCQ ( data not shown ) .
Although endogenous PKC undergoes a similar redistribution as exogenously expressed PKCOQ during CD28 costimulation ( data not shown ) , it was not possible with the available anti-IKK Abs to obtain a strong enough signal to study endogenous IKK redistri-bution .
This was , however , achieved by the biochemical and coimmunoprecipitation studies shown in Figs .
2 and 6 .
Discussion In this paper , we have demonstrated that PKCO participates in CD3/CD28-induced activation of IKKs in primary human CD4 * lymphocytes .
DN-PKCO and a Ca**-independent PKC inhibitor interfered in the activation of the IKK complexes as well as the CD28RE of the IL-2 promoter .
Moreover , IKKs and PKCO were recruited from the cytosol to a talin-enriched , detergent-resistant cellular compartment during CD28 costimulation .
Similarly , PKCO , talin , and IKKs were recruited to GM 1-enriched lipid rafts , which represent a detergent resistant membrane compartment .

DA-PKCO induces IKKB relocation to the surface membrane .
A , Jurkat T cells were transfected with IKKB/wt-PKCO ( 15 ug each ) or IKKB/DA-PKCO ( 10 ug each ) .
After resting for 24 h , an aliquot of the former population was stimulated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 mAb conjugated to microspheres ( 4 beads/cell ) for 1 h. Cytospin preparations of cells were stained for PKCO using a goat anti-PKCO ( 5 ug/ml ) primary Ab followed by a PE-conjugated rabbit anti-goat serum .
IKKB was stained with a FITC-conjugated anti-Flag antiserum ( 5 ug/ml each ) .
Slides were examined under a LEICA Confocal Microscope .
These images are representative of > 80 % of the DA-PKCQO/Flag-IKKB coexpressing cells , whereas > 50 % of the cells transfected with wt-PKCO/Flag-IKKB showed relocation upon stimulation .
Jurkat Stimulus : IKKs recruited to the lipid rafts were active .
It was also possible to show that the activated IKK signalsome coimmunoprecipitate with PKC 0A from CD3/CD28 costimulated primary CD4 * lymphocytes .
Moreover , active PKC and IKK were recruited to and colocalized in the membrane of stimulated Jurkat T cells as determined by confocal microscopy .
It was also demonstrated that exogenously expressed DA-PKCO activated IKK , but not IKKa , in Jurkat cells .
Similarly , DN-IKK $ , but not DN-IKKa , interfered in the activation of the CD28RE by DA-PKCO .
Taken together , these findings demonstrate stimulus-dependent interaction between PKC and IKK components , and present a novel mechanism to explain synergistic activation of IKKs by TCR and CD28 .
Although some components of the IKK signalsome have been identified , its overall composition and regulation have not been fully characterized ( 17-22 , 39 ) .
Indeed , the evolving scenario points to heterogeneous IKK complexes responding to different stimuli ( 24 , 39 , 40 ) , including TCR/CD28 costimulation in primary T cells ( 8 ) .
Stimulus-dependent assembly and activation of IKK complexes is an attractive model , considering the multitude of stimuli involved in NF-KB activation ( 24 , 40 ) .
Four different serine-threonine kinases have now been implicated in the activation of the IKKs by CD3/CD28 , namely MEKK 1 , NF-KB-inducing kinase , Cot , and PKCO ( 7 , 25-28 ) .
Although our overexpression studies in Jurkat cells confirm the recently published data about the role of PKC Q in IKK activation ( Fig .
3 ) ( 26 , 27 ) , the current communication extends those findings by showing the recruitment and colocalization of PKCQ and IKKs in the membrane of T cells ( Figs .
5-7 ) .
Moreover , we demonstrate that PKC and IKKs are physically associated with a macromolecular complex that can be reversibly precipitated with Abs to PKCO or IKKs from lysates prepared from CD3 + CD28-stimulated cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
Coudronniere et al .
( 26 ) recently reported that rottlerin , an inhibitor of novel PKC isoforms , interfered in the activation of the NF-KB pathway and the CD28RE by the TCR .
We show here that treatment of primary human CD4* with rottlerin inhibits the CD3/ 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG The Journal of Immunology CD28-mediated activation of endogenous IKK complexes ( Fig .
1 ) .
G56976 , an inhibitor of classical PKC isoforms , had no effects on IKK activity and transcriptional activation of the CD28RE ( Figs .
1 and 4 ) .
Although the role of other PKC isoforms in the activation of the NF-KB pathway has been demonstrated , our findings implicate PKCO in IKK activation and recruitment during CD3/CD28 costimulation T cells .
We found that endogenous PKCO physically associated with the IKK signalsome in the cell membrane ( Figs .
2 and 7 ) .
Although this interaction was minimal affected by of CD3 ligation , the association was markedly augmented by CD28 costimulation ( Fig .
24 ) .
Although the importance of PKCO in IKK activation was recently reported ( 26 , 27 ) , this is the first evidence for CD3/CD28-induced association of PKCQ with the IKK complex in a physiologically relevant system .
Although a previous study could not demonstrate that PKC O directly interacts with IKK components ( 27 ) , it is possible that this interaction involve additional components of a macromolecular complex , e.g .
, cytoskeletal or scaffolding proteins .
This aspect requires further study .
We propose that PKCO/IKK association takes place in the immunological synapse .
PKCO along with IKK « , IKK B , and IKK y were recruited to the membrane fractions and lipid rafts in primary human CD4 * lymphocytes ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) .
Lipid rafts , which are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains , are docking sites for the attachment of costimulatory receptors and signaling molecules in the cell membrane ( 1 , 29 30 , 38 ) .
Formation of the TCR synapse and the assembly of productive signaling complexes in the lipid rafts require reorganization of the cortical cytoskeleton ( 30 , 35 ) , and may explain our finding that the IKKs and PKCO are recruited to a detergent-insoluble cellular compartment that includes talin and spectrin ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) .
CD28 participates in the organization of lipid rafts and recruitment of the associated signaling molecules to the TCR synapse ( 1 , 5 , 38 ) .
Recruitment of the IKK components to the lipid rafts represents a novel aspect of CD28 function , which may also be responsible for activation of the IKK complex ( Fig .
6C ) and the NF-kB pathway .
The mechanism of CD28-induced recruitment of signaling molecules to the lipid rafts is poorly understood .
However , recent studies have demonstrated that CD28 contributes to the rearrangement of the cytoskeletal complex at the TCR contact site via the activation of Vav ( 41 ) .
Vav has been shown to participate in the recruitment of PKCO to the T cell membrane and the cytoskeleton during TCR engagement ( 41 ) We hypothesize that this process is essential for the recruitment of IKK to the lipid rafts .
Although ectopically expressed wt PKC and IKK colocalized in the membrane after CD3/CD28 costimulation , and IKK B spontaneously localized in the membrane in the absence of any stimuli ( Fig .
7 ) .
This suggests that , in addition to its role in IKK activation ( 26 , 27 ) , may also play a role in the recruitment of IKK to the T cell membrane .
The idea that the IKKs are activated in the vicinity of the TCR is further strengthened by the demonstration that TNF-a induces the IKK holoenzyme to associate with components of the p55 TNF receptor site in the cytoplasmic membrane ( 42 ) .
In conclusion , we have shown that , during CD28 costimulation , PKCQ-induced IKK activation in primary human CD4~ T cells involves their physical interaction with an activation complex that localizes in the T cell membrane .
This may represent an early event in the activation of the NF-kB cascade during CD3/CD28 costimulation .
The signaling molecules that attract IKKs to the lipid rafts remain to be identified .
However , because DA-PKCO facilitated the relocation of IKK/3 to the membranes ( Fig .
7 ) , it is tempting to speculate that PKCO plays an active role in this pro-cess .
PKCO activity has also been linked to JNK activation , and this pathway synergizes with the NF-KB cascade in the activation of the IL-2 promoter ( 7 , 31-33 ) .
In this regard , PKCO may act as 6939 a master switch responsible for the regulation of key signaling pathways involved in the delivery of signal two .
