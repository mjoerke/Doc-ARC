Interleukin-4 Inhibits the Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Expression of c-jun and c-fos Messenger RNA and Activator Protein-1 Binding Activity in Human Monocytes By Willem H.A .
Dokter , Mariet T. Esselink , M. Ruud Halie , and Edo Vellenga We studied the effect of interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) on the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of two immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun .
These genes encode proteins that form the dimeric complex activator protein-1 { ( AP-1 ) , which is active as a transcriptional factor .
Maximal accumulation of either c-fos and c-jun messenger RNA ( mRNA ) occurred 30 minutes after LPS addition .
When cells were treated with IL-4 for 5 hours before LPS activation , both the c-fos and the c-jun mRNA expression was decreased .
The inhi- NTERLEUKIN-4 ( IL-4 ) , a product of activated T lym-phocytes , `` affects , among others , B cells , T cells , monocytes , mast cells , and haematopoietic progenitor cells .
** It has been shown that IL-4 inhibits the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced expression of IL-1 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor a ( TNFa ) , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) messenger RNA ( mRNA ) in monocytes and the secretion of these proteins . ``
The common feature in these studies was a suppressive effect of IL-4 on the cytokine expression , whereby IL-4 by itself does not induce cytokine expression .
The transcription factor activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) is a heterodimer formed by a product of the Fos family , which includes the genes c-fos , fra-1 , fra-2 , and fos B , and a product of the Jun family , which includes the genes c-jun , junB , and junD .
'* `` `` A homodimer with a lower affinity for the AP-1-binding sequence can be formed by members of the Jun family .
AP-1 plays an important role in regulation of cytokine expression . ``
'' It recognizes the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) -responsive element ( TRE ) with the target sequence TGACTCA , ** `` which is present in the promoter region of many cytokine genes .
To test whether IL-4 also affects the expression of AP-1 , we studied the effect of IL-4 on the LPS-induced expression of the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun .
The results demonstrate that IL-4 inhibits c-fos and c-jun mRNA accumulation , which could be ascribed to an inhibitory effect on the c-fos and c-jun transcription rate .
Furthermore , IL-4 was shown to inhibit the expression of LPS-induced AP-1 protein .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of cells .
- Peripheral blood cells were obtained from volunteer platelet donors and mononuclear cell suspensions were prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation .
T lym-phocytes were removed by 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide ( AET ) -treated sheep red blood cell rosetting .
Monocytes were further enriched by plastic adherence ( 1 hour at 37°C ) and demonstrated a purity greater than 95 % as detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) analysis with CD14 ( Becton Dickinson , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Monocytes were cultured at a density of 1 to 2 X 10°/mL in RPMI 1640 media ( Flow , Rockville , MD ) without serum , supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin , 100 ug/mL streptomycin , and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine .
Before activation , cells were kept in the described medium for 16 hours .
Cells were then treated for various time periods with 1 ug/ mL LPS ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , serotype 10 ; Sigma , St Louis , MO ) , with 15 ng/mL human recombinant IL-4 ( gift of Dr P. Trotta , Schering Plough , Bloomfield , NJ ) , or with 1 ug/mL LPS after 5 hours Blood , Vol 81 , No 2 ( January 15 ) , 1993 : 337-343 bition of c-fos and c-jun expression by IL-4 in LPS-treated cells was shown to be due to a lower transcription rate of the c-fos and c-jun genes .
IL-4 did not affect the stability of the c-fos and c-jun transcripts .
Finally , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , evidence was obtained that IL-4 inhibits LPS-induced expression of AP-1 protein .
These data indicate that IL-4 suppresses the induction of transcription factors in human activated monocytes .

of incubation with 15 ng/mL IL-4 , respectively .
The specific activity of IL-4 was 10 `` U/mg .
The calcium ionophore A23187 ( Sigma ) was used at a concentration of 1 gmol/L .
Actinomycin D ( ActD ; Boeh-ringer , Mannheim , Germany ) was used at a concentration of 10 ug/ mL .
mRNA extraction and analysis .
- Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidium isothiocyanate/CsCl method . ``
'' Nine micrograms total RNA was electrophoresed in 2.2 mol/L formaldehyde , 1.1 % agarose gels , and blotted onto nylon membranes ( Hybond N+ ; Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
The following cDNA probes were labeled with [ a `` P ] dCTP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ; Amersham ) by the random hexamer priming method `` `` : ( 1 ) the 0.9-kb Neo I/Sca I insert containing exons 3 and 4 of a human c-fos DNA purified from the pc-fos plasmid `` * `` `` ; ( 2 ) the 1.2-kb EcoRI/BamHI insert of a human c-jun cDNA purified from the pe-jun plasmid `` ( both plasmids are a gift from Dr R. Henschler , Freiburg , Germany ) ; ( 3 ) the EcoRI linearized pBR 322 plasmid containing a 7.8-kb human 28 $ DNA insert .
Hybridization was performed at 65°C for 18 hours in 0.5 mol/L Na ; HPO , , pH 7.2 , 1 mmol/L EDTA , 7 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) .
Membranes were washed once in 2 % SSC , 0.1 % SDS , once in 1 % SSC , 0.1 % SDS , and finally in 0.3 % SSC , 0.1 % SDS for 10 minutes at 65°C .
Hybridization was made visible by exposure of the membranes to Kodak X-Omat XAR films ( Eastman Kodak , Roch-ester , NY ) at -80°C using an intensifying screen .
Quantification of mRNA levels was performed by densitometry using a Gel Scan laser densitometer ( Pharmacia LKB , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
Values were corrected for differences in gel loading by normalization to the respective 288 signals .
Run on transcription assay .
- For the nuclear run on assay , monocytes of four donors were cultured for 16 hours in RPMI 1640 medium at a density of 1 to 2 X 10° cells/mL .
Cells were collected by careful use of a rubber policeman and 10 `` cells were pelleted separately for each donor at 500g for 5 minutes , washed twice with ice-cold phos-phate-buffered saline , and suspended in 4 mL of lysis-buffer ( 10 mmol/ L Tris-HCL , pH 7.5 , 3 mmol/L MgCl ) ; , 10 mmol/L NaCl , 0.5 % NP From the Division of Hematology , Department of Medicine , University of Groningen , The Netherlands .

After gentle vortexing , the suspension was incubated on ice for 5 minutes .
Nuclei were pelleted at 500g for 5 minutes and the above described lysis was repeated .
The nuclei of four donors were pooled and resuspended in 100 LL glycerol-buffer ( 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl , pH 8.0 , 40 % glycerol , 5 mmol/L MgCl , , 0.1 mmol/L EDTA ) and incubated at 26°C for 20 minutes with 80 gL transcription-buffer ( 12.5 mmol/L Tris-HCI , pH 8.0 , 6 mmol/L MgCl , , 125 mmol/L KCI , 2 mmol/L dithiothreitol , 1 mmol/L each of ATP , CTP , and GTP ) and 12.5 LL [ aP ] UTP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ; Amersham ) .
Transcription was terminated by the addition of 40 U DNAse I , 150 U RNAsin , 40 ug yeast RNA , and 200 LL stop-buffer ( 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 0.5 mol/L NaCl , 50 mmol/L MgC1 ; , 2 mmol/L CaCl ) ; ) .
The solution was then incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes .
After a proteinase K digestion ( 750 U proteinase K/mL ) in 1 % SDS , the nuclear RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extractions and then ethanol precipitated two times in 2.5 mol/L ammonium acetate .
The RNA was further purified by Sephadex G-50 column separation .
Five micrograms of the following DNAs were immobilized on Hybond N+ membranes : ( 1 ) EcoRI linearized pBR322 ; ( 2 ) Xho I linearized pc-fos containing a 3.1-kb fragment of all 4 human c-fos exons `` * `` `` ; ( 3 ) EcoRI linearized pe-jun containing a 1.2-kb fragment of human c-jun cDNA `` ; ( 4 ) EcoRI linearized plasmid containing a 7.8-kb human 28 $ DNA .
Hybridization of labeled RNA to these membranes was as described above .
Washing was as described above except that an extra wash-step with 2 % SSC , 1 ug/mL RNase A ( Boehringer ) was included .
Exposure and quantification of transcription rate levels were performed as described above .
Transcription rates were normalized with respect to the 288 signal .
Nuclear extract preparation .
- After stimulation for various time periods , nuclear extracts were prepared according to the miniscale procedure described by Schreiber et al . ``
'' Nuclear extracts were divided in small aliquots , frozen in liquid N ; , and stored at -80°C .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
- The AP-1 probe used in the gel retardation assays was obtained by annealing synthetic oligonu-cleotides : 5°-AGCTCGCGTGACTCAGCTG-3 ' 3'-GCGCACTGAGTCGACCTAG-5 ' The consensus sequence for binding of AP-1 is underlined .
Fifty nanograms of high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) -purified single-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase and [ 7P ] ATP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ; Amersham } , separated from nonincorporated radiolabel by sephadex G50 chro-matography , ethanol precipitated , dried , and dissolved in 20 kL of 10 mmol/L Tris-HCI ( pH 7.5 ) /50 mmol/L mmol/L MgCly/ 1 mmol/L EDTA/1 mmol/L DTT , containing a fourfold excess of the opposite strand .
Annealing of the two strands was performed by heating the mixture for 2 minutes at 90°C and slow cooling to room temperature .
Reannealed DNA corresponding to 0.1 ng of labeled oligonucleotide and 0.4 ng unlabeled oligonucleotide was incubated with 3 ug nuclear extract in 20 mmol/L HEPES ( pH 7.9 ) , 60 mmol/L KCl , 0.06 mmol/L EDTA , 0.6 mmol/L DTT , 2 mmol/L spermidine , 10 % glycerol , supplemented with 2 ug poly ( dl-dC ) .
The mixture was preincubated for 10 minutes on ice before adding the labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide .
The binding reaction was performed at 26°C for 25 minutes .
Competition experiments were performed by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled self or nonself oligonucleotides before preincubation on ice .
An oligonucleotide with the sequence : 5-AGCTGCCGGGATTTTCCCTG-3 3-CGCCCCTAAAAGGGACCTAG- 5 DOKTER ET AL spanning the nuclear factor « B ( NF- « B ) recognition site `` `` ( under-lined ) , was used as the nonself oligo .
The samples were loaded on prerunned ( 30 minutes at 100 V ) 4 % ( 30:1 ) polyacrylamide gels and run for 1 hour at 150 V in 0.5 % TBE at room temperature .
Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR films at -80°C with an intensifying screen .
The same batches of proteins and labeled oligonucleotides were used in the reactions presented in the figure .
RESULTS In accordance with previous reports , `` peripheral blood monocytes isolated immediately after plastic adherence for 1 hour demonstrated a high expression of c-fos mRNA ( data not shown ) .
However , after a 16-hour incubation period in serum-free medium , a low expression of c-fos mRNA was noticed .
Therefore , monocytes were treated after a 16-hour incubation period in serum-free medium .
The effect of IL-4 pretreatment on the LPS-induced c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression was studied .
This sequential treatment was chosen because the most pronounced effect of IL-4 on G-CSF expression in response to LPS stimulation was noticed after a short period of preincubation . ``
Human monocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of IL-4 for 5 hours and subsequently stimulated with LPS .
Total cellular RNA was extracted and c-fos , c-jun , and 288 transcripts were detected by Northern hybridization .
As shown in Fig 1 , IL-4 lowered the LPS-induced c-fos and c-jun mRNA accumulation .
After 30 minutes of LPS activation , both the c-fos and the c-jun mRNA accumulation was decreased approximately twofold to threefold .
Proto-oncogene mRNA expression returned to baseline levels after 60 to 120 minutes of LPS treatment .
In addition , it was shown that the kinetics of c-fos and c-jun mRNA accumulation were not changed by IL-4 , neither did IL-4 by itself induce c-fos or c-jun mRNA expression ( data not shown ) .
To exclude the possibility that the effect of IL-4 on the expression of the c-fos and c-jun genes was related to a change in the LPS-binding properties , we determined the effect of IL-4 on the c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression induced by the calcium ionophore A23187 .
`` `` * IL-4 was shown to inhibit the A23187-induced c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression with a factor of 2 to 3 ( data not shown ) .
Run-on assays were performed to determine whether the effect of IL-4 on the LPS-induced c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression involves a decrease in the transcription rate of these genes .
Nuclear RNA was isolated from cells that were treated with medium ( control ) , IL-4 for 3 hours , LPS for 10 minutes , and IL-4 ( 3 hours ) plus LPS ( 10 minutes ) .
Nuclear RNA was hybridized to pBR322 ( negative control ) , c-fos , c-jun , and 288 DNAs .
Several run-on experiments using un-stimulated cells from different donors showed great variability in the transcription rate of the c-fos and c-jun genes ( data not shown ) .
To avoid the problem of donor to donor vari-ability , monocyte nuclei of four donors were pooled before the run-on reaction was started .
Control cells demonstrated a constitutive transcription of the c-fos and the c-jun genes ( Fig 2 ) .
In both control cells and in LPS-stimulated cells , IL-4 strongly reduced the transcriptional activity of the c-fos and c-jun gene ( approximately threefold ) , indicating that transcriptional mechanisms mediate the suppressive effect of From www .

The transcript size for c-fos is 2.2 kb and for c-jun 2.7 kb for the major transcript and 3.2 kb for the minor transcript .

The result is one of three experiments performed .
IL-4 on proto-oncogene mRNA expression .
Similar results were obtained when cells were treated for 5 or 20 minutes with LPS ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether posttranscriptional mechanisms are also involved in the regulation of c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression by IL-4 , the stability of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs was studied .
First , the half-life of c-fos and c-jun transcripts in uninduced monocytes was determined by incubating the cells with ActD .
The half-life of both transcripts in uninduced cells is approximately 25 minutes ( Fig 3 ) as determined by densito-metric scanning and normalization of the signals to the respective 28S signal .
Upon activation with LPS for 30 minutes , c-fos and c-jun mRNAs were slightly stabilized and decayed with half-lives of approximately 35 and 45 minutes , respectively ( Fig 3 ) .
A 5-hour pretreatment with IL-4 had no significant effect on the stability of c-fos and c-jun transcripts ( Fig 3 ) .
The data consistently show an initial stabilization of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs within the first 15 minutes .
In two additional experiments , similar results were obtained .
Thus , IL-4 does not modulate LPS-induced c-fos and c-jun mRNA accumulation at the posttranscriptional level .
To study whether these mRNA data reflect changes at the protein level , we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) .
339 To study the effect of IL-4 on the LPS-induced expression of AP-1 , nuclear extracts were prepared from control cells and IL-4- and LPS-stimulated cells and monocytes that were pretreated with IL-4 and subsequently activated with LPS .
Nuclei of five donors were pooled before the extraction of nuclear proteins .
Nuclear extracts were incubated with a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the AP-1 consensus binding site .
As shown in Fig 4 , LPS-stimulated monocytes expressed AP-1 protein that was suppressed by pretreatment with IL-4 .
Protein-DNA complexes were specifically competed by a 100-fold molar excess of the nonlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide , but not by a 100-fold molar excess of a oligonucleotide spanning the NF- « B recognition site ( Fig 4 ) , showing that protein-DNA complexes were specific .
DISCUSSION The present study demonstrates that IL-4 inhibits LPS-induced expression of c-fos and c-Jun mRNA and AP-1 levels in human adherent monocytes .
The effect of IL-4 was mediated at the transcriptional level by downregulation of the transcriptional activity of the c-fos and c-jun genes .
In addition , it was observed that , despite the relatively high c-fos transcription rate in uninduced monocytes , low amounts of c-fos mRNA were detected .
This may be due to an elongation block upstream from exon 3 , as described for the c fos gene in murine and hamster macrophages .

transcription of the first two exons and the last two exons of the c-fos gene occurred at a similar rate .
Therefore , the low amounts of c-fos mRNA must be ascribed to the instability of the c-fos transcript .
Moreover , they demonstrated a threefold increased c-fos transcription rate upon a 20-minute TPA treatment .
Our nuclear run-on experiment did not show LPS-induced transcriptional activity of the c-fos and c-Jun genes after 5 , 10 , or 20 minutes of LPS treatment .
However , we can not exclude the possibility that the transcription rate of these genes was enhanced by LPS .
The experimental procedure for isolating nuclei requires at least 20 minutes in which we might have missed the peak in transcriptional activity .
This is further underscored by the mRNA stability studies , which showed only a small initial stabilization of oncogene mRNA within the first 15 minutes after LPS treatment .

quate to explain the large accumulation of LPS-induced c-fos and c-jun mRNA .
Half-lives of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs were similar to half-lives of c-jun transcripts in TPA-treated HL-60 cells* `` and c-fos transcripts in TPA-treated human monocytes . ``
IL-4 was shown to have no effect on the stability of c-fos and c-jun mRNA .
Control of stability of mRNA is poorly understood , but the process likely involves factors interacting with mRNA sequences .
** `` The AU-rich motifs in the 3 ' noncoding region of many short-living mRNAs are shown to be the target of a pathway for mRNA degradation and an AUUUA-specific mRNA-binding protein has been identi-fied .
*** `` Both the c-jun and the c-fos transcripts share these AU-rich sequences in their 3 ' noncoding regions , which might explain the high turnover rate of these However , Shyu et al `` `` demonstrated that the instability of the c-fos transcript is not merely mediated by the presence of the AU 341 rich motif .
They observed that the primary pathway for c fos mRNA decay is degradation mediated by a determinant in the coding region of c-fos mRNA . ``
To demonstrate the relevance of the mRNA results , we performed EMSAs and studied the effect of IL-4 on the expression of AP-1 , a transcription factor formed by the protein products of the c-fos and c-Jun genes .
In accordance with the mRNA results , IL-4 was shown to lower the levels of LPS-induced AP-1 .
We `` and others® ' `` `` * `` have shown previously that IL-4 inhibits expression of TNFa , IL-1 , G-CSF , and IL-6 .
Furthermore , LPS-induced IL-1 expression in human monocytes was shown to be inhibited by IL-4 at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels . ``
} The promoter regions of these genes all contain binding sites for AP-1 .
Therefore , it is tempting to speculate about IL-4-induced AP-1 inhibition as being the mechanism by which IL-4 inhibits cytokine expression .
However , several studies demonstrated that other transcription factors , such as NF- « B , activating transcription factor ( ATF ) , and nuclear factor IL-6 ( NF-IL6 ) are also of importance in the regulation of cytokine expression . ``
'' Studies addressing the effect of IL-4 on the expression of these transcription factors are currently un-derway .
In conclusion , the results demonstrate that IL-4 inhibits the LPS-induced c-fos and c-/ur mRNA accumulation as well as AP-1 levels in human monocytes , which is mediated by transcriptional mechanisms .
