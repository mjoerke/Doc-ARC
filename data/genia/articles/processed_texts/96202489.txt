RAPID COMMUNICATION STAT-Related Transcription Factors Are Constitutively Activated in Peripheral Blood Cells From Acute Leukemia Patients By Valérie Gouilleux-Gruart , Fabrice Gouilleux , Corinne Desaint , Jean-Frangois Claisse , Jean-Claude Capiod , Jacques Delobel , Renate Weber-Nordt , Isabelle Dusanter-Fourt , Frangois Dreyfus , Bernd Groner , and Lionel Prin A signal transduction pathway activated by many cytokines has recently been elaborated .
The JAK kinases and the signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) factors have been found to be essential components .
In this report , we describe the presence of constitutively activated STAT factors in peripheral blood cells from patients with acute leukemia .
We used oligonucleotide probes from the B-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters and the ISRE probe to detect STAT proteins in nuclear extracts from acute leukemia cells in bandshift assays .
Specific DNA protein complex formation was observed with the probes from the B-casein and IRF-1 gene promoters , but not with the ISRE oligonucleotide probe , when cell extracts from acute lymphoblastic leuke- EVELOPMENT , maintenance , and functional activation of immune surveillance and effector cells are under the control of a wide spectrum of interleukins ( ILs ) , growth factors , and hormones .
The interaction of a cytokine with its receptor triggers specific events such as gene tran-scription , protein expression , and release leading either to differentiation or proliferation depending on the cells .
The STAT proteins are a new family of transcription factors involved in cytokine , growth factor , and hormone signal transduction .
'~ `` Cytokine binding to their receptors leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of associated cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases .
These kinases belong to the JAK fam-ily .
JAKs phosphorylate STAT proteins , and STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific DNA sequences in promoter regions of responsive genes . ``
Different members of the STAT factor family have been cloned and the cytokines and hormones stimulating their activation have been studied .
p91-Statl constitutes the inter-feron-y - ( IFN-y ) -activated transcription factor , ° p91-STAT1 , and pl13-STAT2 together with the p48 subunit constitute the IFN- « / $ responsive transcription factor ( ISGF-3 ) .

We used nonradioactive oligonucleotides as competitors to show the specificity of the complex formation .

STAT5- and STATi-related factors were detected in ALL and STAT1- , STAT3- , and STAT5-related proteins were present in nuclear cell extracts from AML .
Since the cells were not treated with cytokines before the nuclear proteins were extracted , we conclude that these factors are constitutively activated in vivo .
It is likely that the constitutive activation of STAT proteins is a part of the events of leukemogenesis .

STAT6 is mainly activated in response to IL-4 and IL_3.23,24 Because cytokines not only regulate the differentiation of the cells but also play an important role in proliferation , it is reasonable to assume that aberrations in the JAK-STAT pathway could be involved in tumor formation .
Several observations support this hypothesis .
It has been shown that an amino acid substitution in the Drosophilia homolog of the JAK kinase gene causes leukemia-like hematopoietic defects . ``
Overactivity of the mutated protein is responsible for the malignant neoplasia . ``
'' Recently , the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway has been described in T cells transformed with human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 ( HTLV-1 ) .
IL-2-independent growth acquired by cells transformed with HTLV-1 correlates to acquisition of the constitutively activated JAK-STAT path-way . ``
We examined whether constitutively activated STAT proteins can be detected in cells obtained from patients with hematologic malignancies .
We derived nuclear extracts from acute leukemia cells and analyzed them in bandshift assays by using specific oligonucleotide probes and antibodies .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients .
Three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , five patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , and three controls were investigated .
Diagnosis was established according to French- American-British ( FAB ) classification `` `` and associated with immunologic and genetic studies on peripheral blood ( PB ) and bone marrow ( BM ) .

RESULTS Nuclear proteins from patients with acute leukemia bind to distinct GAS elements .
- To analyze the presence of constitutively activated STATs in leukemic cells , nuclear extracts from total leukocytes were derived from patients with ALL ( nos .
1 and 3 ) , AML ( nos .
2 and 4 , see Table 1 ) and from controls .
Three different probes were used in the bandshift assays : ( 1 ) the GAS sequence present in IRF-1 gene promoter and able to bind STAT 1 , STAT3 , and STATS ; ( 2 ) the /3-casein promoter oligonucleotide probe able to bind STATS with high affinity and STAT1 , STAT3 , STAT6 with a lower affinity ; and ( 3 ) the ISRE sequence recognized by ISGF3a complex .
As shown in Fig 1A , a STAT DNA-binding complex was observed with the IRF-1 and the 3-casein oligonucleotide probes and cell extracts from the patients with acute leukemia ( lanes a through h ) .

2 and 4 ) .
The same amount of protein was introduced onto the complex formation .
We separated the mononuclear cell fraction containing the blast population from polymorphonuclear cells ( neutrophils , eosinophils , and basophils represent between 4 % and 15 % of leukocytes in patients 1 to 4 , see Table 1 ) by Ficoll gradient centrifugation .
The bandshift with the IRF-1 oligonucleotide probe and proteins from mononuclear cells from patients 2 and 4 are presented in Fig 1C .
The DNA-binding complex present in total leukocytes ( lanes s and u ) was still detectable when nuclear proteins from purified mononuclear cells ( blast population ) were used ( lanes t and v ) .
Similar results were obtained before and after cell separation .
This excludes the possibility that the cell manipulation is responsible for the results .
A band with slower mobility is present in nuclear cell extracts from patients 3 and 4 ( Fig 1A , lanes c , d , g , and h ) .
This band is not competed by an excess of nonradioactive oligonucleotide and is not specific ( data not shown ) .
It can not be observed after Ficoll purification of the cells ( Fig 1C , compare lanes u and v ) .
Nuclear cell extracts from patients 5 to 8 were obtained after mononuclear cell purification and tested in bandshift assays with the IRF-1 oligonucleotide probe .
Specific DNA-binding complexes were detected with all cell extracts studied ( Table 2 ) .

Various GAS elements were introduced in the assay as competitors .
The results show that the DNA-binding specificities of the complexes detected with nuclear extracts from patients 1 and 2 are different .
The DNA-binding complexes observed with the nuclear extracts from patients 1 and 2 were competed by the corresponding cold probe ( lanes b and m ) , but also by APRE ( lanes j and u ) and by GAS elements found in the FeyRI ( lanes e and p ) , 3-casein ( lanes f and q ) , and FeeRIIb ( lanes g and r ) gene promoters .

These data suggest that the STAT-related factors constitutively activated in patients 1 and 2 are not identical .
STAT !
- , STAT3- , and STATS-related factors are present in the DNA-binding complexes .
_ We examined which STAT was constitutively activated in leukemic cells by using specific antibodies directed against STAT1 , STAT2 , STAT3 , STAT4 , and STATS ( Fig 3 ) .
Bandshift experiments were performed with the IRF-1 oligonucleotide probe and nuclear extracts from cells of patients with ALL ( no .

2 ) was not recognized by STAT1 , STAT2 , STAT4 , and STATS antisera ( lanes h , i , k , and 1 ) .
However , DNA-binding complex formation was inhibited with the anti-STAT3 ( C ) antiserum ( lane j ) .
The results obtained with the nuclear extracts from patients 3 to 8 and STAT antisera are presented in Table 2 .
As for patient no .

This antiserum reacts also with DNA-binding complexes from patients with AML nos .

Supershift of the DNA-binding complex formed with ALL ( no .
8 ) and AML ( no .
6 ) occurred in presence of anti-STAT1 antibody .
We tested three antibodies directed against different parts of the STAT3 protein ( Fig 4A ) .
DNA-binding complexes formed with the IRF-1 oligonucleotide probe ( lane a ) and nuclear proteins from AML patient ( no .
2 ) were inhibited by the anti-STAT3 ( C ) antiserum ( lane b ) and supershifted by the anti-STAT3 ( 30C ) antiserum ( lanes c ) .
A similar pattern of antibody recognition was obtained with the complex formed by the proteins from AML no .

No change in the mobility of the complex was detected with the anti-STAT3 ( C-20 ) antibody ( lane d ) .
This antibody is raised against the amino acids 750-769 of the carboxy terminus of STAT3 and recognizes STAT3 factor in the T47D human mammary carcinoma cell line treated with IL-6 for 15 min ( Fig 4B , lane f ) .
The anti-STAT3 ( C ) and the anti-STAT3 ( 3OC ) antisera are respectively directed against amino acids 688 to 727 and 718 to 770 of the carboxy terminus .
These results suggest that the STAT3-related factor in the AML differs in the amino acids of the C terminus from the previously described STAT3 protein .
DISCUSSION We identified constitutively activated DNA-binding proteins in leukemic cells from patients with ALL and AML by bandshift analysis .
The competition experiments with various GAS elements , able to bind STAT proteins with different efficiency , show the existence of distinct STAT related transcription factors in the nuclear extracts from acute leukemia .

1696 A distinct pattern of competition by different oligonucleotides has been established when recombinant STATS protein has been analyzed in bandshift assays . ``
An identical pattern of competition was found when the proteins from ALL cells were tested .
This strongly suggests that STATS or a closely related factor is activated in these cells .
This conclusion was supported by the observation that the DNA-binding complex was supershifted by the anti-STATS5 antiserum .
A protein with this DNA-binding specificity is also induced by erythro-poietin , thrombopoietin or GM-CSF in UT7 cell line . ``
'' STATS5-related factor was also detected in two of five patients with AML .
Oligonucleotide competition and recognition by anti-STAT3 antibodies indicate that in M1 , M4 , and MS AML , STAT3 is part of the DNA-protein complex .
The use of three slightly different antibodies demonstrates that the STAT3-related proteins present in AML differ in their C terminus from the described STAT3 transcription factor .
It is possible that a highly related STAT3 factor , as in the case of STAT 5a and STATSb , `` °** `` or splice variants of STAT3 protein , as described for STATla and STAT1P , `` have been detected .
Recently , a short form of STAT3 , was identified by its interaction with an N-terminal segment of c-jun in the yeast two-hybrid screen of a mammalian cDNA library .
is missing the 55 C-terminal amino acid residues and has 7 additional amino acid residues at its C terminus . ``
The STAT3-related protein detected in AML patients might be related to STAT 33 .
However , another explanation for the results obtained with the three anti-STAT3 antibodies is that STAT3 might be involved in a complex with different proteins in the AML cells and thus the epitope recognized by the anti-STAT3 ( C-20 ) antibody is not available to be recognized by this antibody .
Supershift experiments with the various anti-STAT antibodies showed that STAT i-related factor is also constitutively activated in some patients with ALL or AML .
STAT DNA-binding occurred without the in vitro stimulation of the cells before nuclear protein extraction .
These proteins need to be phosphorylated on tyrosine before they translocate to nucleus and bind to DNA . ``
This implies that the STAT proteins detected in nuclear extracts from ALL and AML cells are tyrosine phosphorylated .
The addition of antiphosphotyrosine antibody in the bandshift assays leads to a decrease of the DNA-complex formation ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , these results might indicate that the tyrosine kinase responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins is activated .
STAT proteins are thought to be the substrates of the JAK tyrosine kinases .
It has been reported recently that a mutation of the hopTum-1 gene , the Drosophila homolog of JAK kinase causes leukemia-like hematopoietic defects . ``
This mutation leads to the constitutive activity of the protein . ``
Identification of target genes induced by constitutively activated JAK in Drosophila and activated STAT proteins in human leukemic cells will be of great interest .
Constitutively activated STAT proteins have also been observed in human breast tumors `` and in mice with an onco-transgene . ``
The mechanism by which the STAT proteins become activated in ALL and AML cells is not known .
The production GOUILLEUX-GRUART ET AL of cytokines and growth factors by leukemic cells might be involved in the differential activation of STAT proteins in acute leukemia .
ALL and AML are divided in various subtypes characterized by the lineage and the degree of maturation of the cells involved in the leukemia .
It is possible that activation of other STAT members is implicated in the other subtypes depending on cell differentiation , maturation , and cytokine production .
Another mechanism of constitutive activation of STAT proteins could be a bypass of cytokine receptors by an oncogenic pathway .
Recently , an enhanced DNA-binding activity of a STAT3-related protein has been described in cells transformed by the Src oncoprotein . ``
The participation of the strong BCR-ABL kinase activity resulting from the translocation t ( 9,22 ) `` * `` can be envisaged in the constitutive activation of STAT proteins in leukemia associated with the Ph chromosome .
Jak-STAT signaling is induced by the v-ab/ oncogene . ``
These data might explain the strong STATS constitutive activation observed in nuclear extracts from the Ph ' positive ALL and in the K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line ( data not shown ) .
Our findings that constitutive activation of STATI , STAT3 , and STATS occurs in cells from acute leukemia raises the possibility that STAT signaling pathway regulates expression of cellular genes that participate to leukemogenesis .
