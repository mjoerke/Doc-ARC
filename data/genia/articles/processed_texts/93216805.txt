The Spl Transcription Factor Binds the CD11b Promoter Specifically in Myeloid Cells in Vivo and Is Essential for Myeloid-specific Promoter Activity* ( Received for publication , June 19 , 1992 ) Hui-Min Chent§ , Heike L. Pahl # § ( || , Renate J. Scheibet , Dong-Er Zhang } , and Daniel G. Tenent** From the { Department of Medicine , Hematology/Oncology Division , Beth Israel Hospital , Harvard Medical School and the [ Department of Genetics , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02215 The myeloid integrin CD11b is expressed selectively on the surface of mature macrophages , monocytes , neutrophils , and natural killer cells .
Lineage-specific expression is controlled at the level of mRNA tran-scription .
Recent isolation of the CD11b promoter shows that 92 base pairs ( bp ) of 5'-flanking DNA are sufficient to direct myeloid-specific expression of a reporter gene .
To characterize regulatory sequences important for promoter activity , we performed linker scanning analysis of the 92-bp CD11b promoter and demonstrate that a sequence at bp -60 is essential for CD11b promoter activity .
We show that this sequence binds the transcription factor Spl in vitro and in vivo .
In vivo the Spl site is bound only in myeloid ( U937 ) cells , not in cervical carcinoma ( HeLa ) cells .
In addition , the macrophage transcription factor PU.1 binds the CD11b promoter in vitro and in vivo close to the Spl site .
We propose a model in which binding of a myeloid-specific factor ( PU.1 ) allows a general factor ( Sp1 ) to bind in a tissue-specific fashion thereby contributing to the myeloid-specific expression of CD11b .
In the hematopoietic system , pluripotential stem cells develop to form a variety of mature circulating blood cells ( 1 ) .
The factors committing pluripotential progenitors to differentiation along a specific lineage are poorly understood .
Furthermore , only some factors responsible for lineage-specific gene expression have been identified .
In the erythroid lineage , a transcription factor , GATA-1 , is essential for the development of mature , circulating red blood cells ( 2 ) .
In addition , GATA-1 regulates the expression of many erythroid-specific genes ( 3-5 ) .
GATA-1 is an example of a `` master transcription factor , `` a single factor sufficient to induce lineage-specific differentiation and gene expression .

In an alternative model , commonly expressed transcription factors could form unique combinations to generate lineage-specific expression of target genes .
Since very little is known about factors regulating the expression of myeloid ( monocytic , neutrophilic ) genes , we chose to study the expression of CD11b , a marker of the myeloid lineage ( 6 ) .
The heterodimeric surface antigen CD11b/CD18 is a member of the integrin family of cell surface receptors ( 7 , 8 ) .
While CD18 , the 8 subunit of the heterodimer , is expressed in all leukocytes ( 9 ) , expression of CD11b , the « subunit , is restricted to mature macrophages , monocytes , neutrophils , and natural killer cells ( 6 ) .
CD11b is not expressed on immature precursor cells ; however , antigen expression increases up to 40-fold during myeloid differentiation ( 10 ) .
Using run-on transcription assays , we have previously shown that CD11b expression and up-regulation are controlled at the level of mRNA transcription ( 11 ) .
Subsequently , we cloned the CD11b promoter and have shown that 92 bp !
immediately 5 to the transcription start site are sufficient to direct reporter gene activity specifically in myeloid cells ( 11 ) .
In transient transfection assays using a luciferase reporter gene , the 92-bp CD11b promoter directs 100-fold more luciferase activity in myeloid ( U937 ) than in non-myeloid ( HeLa ) cells ( 11 ) .
Furthermore , we have shown that the proto-onco-gene and macrophage transcription factor PU.1 binds the CD11b promoter at bp -20 and that mutation of this site reduces CD11b promoter activity 3-6-fold in myeloid ( U937 ) cells , but not in non-myeloid ( HeLa ) cells ( 12 ) .
Thus , PU.1 represents a major determinant of the myeloid-specific expression of CD11b .
However , after mutation of the PU.1 site , the CD11b promoter still directs significant levels of reporter gene activity ( 12 ) .
In order to find additional regulatory elements , we performed linker scanning analysis of the 92-bp CD11b promoter .
Here we show that sequences around bp -60 are essential for promoter activity and bind the transcription factor Spl in vitro and in vivo .
In vivo , the Spl site is only occupied in myeloid ( U937 ) cells , not in non-myeloid ( HeLa ) cells , suggesting that it contributes to the myeloid-specific expression of CD11b .

In the -75/-45 mutant , bp -75 to -45 are replaced by the 10-bp linker oligonucleotide .
PCR fragments were cloned into the luciferase vector pXP2 ( 14 ) and resulting constructs sequenced to confirm correct placement of the linker oligonucleotide ( 15 ) .
Transfections-U937 and HeLa cells were transfected by electro-poration in Iscove 's modified Eagle 's medium at 960 microfarads and 250 or 150 V , respectively , as previously described ( 16 ) .
Cells were induced with 3 x 10 ® m TPA ( Sigma ) immediately following trans-fection , and luciferase activity was determined 14 h post transfection .
Luciferase assays were performed as previously described , and data are presented in relative light units ( RLU ) .
Transfection efficiency was normalized to the levels of growth hormone expressed from 2 ug of cotransfected plasmid containing the cytomegalovirus promoter directing growth hormone expression ( 16 ) .
Growth hormone concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay ( Nicol 's Institute , San Juan Capistrano , CA ) .
Nuclear Extracts-The human promonocytic cell line U937 ( ATCC no .

The human epithelial carcinoma cell line HeLa ( ATCC no .
CCL 2 ) was harvested in early logarithmic growth phase .
Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described ( 17 ) with one modification ; the following protease inhibitors were added at the final concentration indicated to every buffer immediately prior to use : 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 ug/ml pepstatin A , 0.5 ug/ml chymostatin , 1 ug/ ml antipain , 1 ug/ml leupeptin , 4 ul/ml aprotinin ( all from Sigma ) .

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ( EMSA ) -The probe for the EMSAs in Figs .
2 , a and c , and 3 was a 130-bp BanI/BbsI fragment which extends from bp -90 to bp +40 of the CD11b promoter ( 11 ) .
The probe was generated by restriction digestion , dephosphorylation , and 5 end labeling ( [ y- `` P ] ATP , NEN , Cambridge , MA ) of the resulting fragments .
In Fig .
2b , 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotides ( for sequences see Fig .
20 ) , labeled at the 5 ends using [ y-P ] ATP were used as probes .
0.5 ng of probe at a specific activity of 5 x 10° cpm/ug ( DNA fragments ) or 2 x 10° cpm/ug ( oligonucleotides ) were incubated with 10 ug of nuclear extract in 20 ul containing a final concentration of 10 mM HEPES , pH 7.5 , 50 mM KCI , 5 mM MgC ) ; , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM EDTA , and 5 % glycerol on ice for 15 min .
Unlabeled competitor DNA fragments or oligonucleotides were added to the nuclear extracts at 50-fold molar excess immediately prior to the addition of the radioactive probe .
In Fig .
2a , lane 7 , the competitor DNA consists of a 97-bp HindIII/PstlI fragment from the tissue plasminogen activator promoter , which contains two characterized Spl sites ( Ref .
18 ; for partial sequence , see Fig .

3 Ll of antiserum or preimmune serum ( 2892-pI ) were added to the reaction immediately prior to the addition of radioactive probe .
Reactions were electrophoresed at 14 V/cm on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel cast in 0.5 X TBE ( 45 mM Tris-borate , 45 mM boric acid , 1 mM EDTA ) at 4 °C .
In order to achieve adequate separation of bands , gels were run sufficiently long so that unincor-porated probe was run off the bottom of the gel .
Similar results were obtained with gels electrophoresed for shorter time ( see Fig .
2¢ ) .
Methylation Interference Assays of Protein-DNA Contacts-Meth-ylation interference assays were performed as described ( 19 ) with minor modifications .

2d ) , or its complement was 5 end-labeled with [ y-*°P ] ATP to a specific activity of 2 x 10° cpm/ug .
The labeled oligonucleotide was annealed with 2.5 ug of its complementary oligonucleotide in 20 ul containing 20 mM Tris , pH 7.5 , 10 mM MgCl ; , 50 mM NaCl , and 1 mM dithiothreitol , heated to 45 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature over 2 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C .
Annealed double-stranded oligonucleotide , labeled on one end , was purified on a 15 % nondenaturing acrylamide gel , and the top band ( annealed probe ) isolated by the `` crush and soak `` method ( 20 ) .
The annealed probe ( 10-50 ng ) was treated with 1 ul of dimethyl sulfate for 5 min at 20 °C in 200 Ll 8231 of 50 mM sodium cacodylate , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8.0 .
2 ng of probe was incubated with either 5 ug of U937 nuclear extract or 0.5 footprinting units ( Promega ) of affinity purified Spl protein in a preparative mobility shift assay as described above .
DNA protein complexes and free ( unbound ) probe were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis of the labeled DNA cut from the polyacrylamide gel onto DEAE mem-branes .

Transactivation of the CD11b Promoter in Drosophila Schneider Cells-The Drosophila Schneider cell line $ 2 was grown in Schneider medium ( Sigma ) supplemented with penicillin , streptomycin , and 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( Hyclone ) .
For transactivation assays , S2 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipi-tation as described ( 21 ) with 10 ug of reporter vector ( either the wild type -412 CD11b promoter or the promoter containing a 2-bp mutation in the Sp1 site placed in front of a luciferase reporter gene ( 11 ; Fig .
2d ) ; 3 ug of the Sp1 expression vector pPacSpl , containing the C-terminal 696 amino acids of Spl in a Drosophila actin promoter expression construct ( 22 ) ; 10 ug of a plasmid containing the cytomegalovirus promoter directing growth hormone expression ( 16 ) ; and KS+ pBluescript ( Stratagene ) to a total of 25 ug of DNA .
In control experiments , the pPac§Sp1 construct was replaced by the retinoic acid receptor a expression vector pSG5RARa ( 23 ) .
Luciferase assays were performed 14 h after transfection as described ( 16 ) .
In Vitro Footprinting-For in vitro footprinting , a 370-bp fragment extending from the EcoRI site at bp -264 of the CD11b promoter to the Hpal site at bp +106 ( 11 ) was subcloned into pGEM 3zf ( + ) ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
The plasmid was digested with EcoRI and HindIII to release the insert , which was radioactively labeled at the HindIII site ( coding strand ) or the EcoRI site ( non-coding strand ) using [ a-* `` P ] dATP as previously described ( 20 ) .
80 ug of HeLa or U937 cell nuclear extracts were incubated with 10 ng of DNA probe , labeled to a specific activity of 1.5 x 10° cpm/ug , and 4 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Promega ) in 10 mM HEPES , pH 7.8 , 30 mm KCI , 12 % glycerol , 5 mm MgCl ; , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 0.1 mM EDTA , and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 30 min .
The DNA was cleaved with 180 ng of DNase I at room temperature for 1 min .
Reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 « 1 of stop solution ( 20 mM EDTA , 0.5 % SDS , 20 mM Tris , pH 7.5 , 75 ug/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA , 100 ug/ml proteinase K ) and subsequent incubation at 37 °C for 30 min .
Reactions were extracted with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform , ethanol precipitated , and products analyzed on a 6 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel .
Chemical sequencing reactions ( 20 ) of the same DNA were used as size standards .
In Vivo Footprinting-¥For in vivo methylation studies in cell lines , 10° uninduced or TPA induced ( 24 h at 3 x 10~° m ) U937 cells or HeLa cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min and resuspended in 2 ml of RPMI medium .
Human monocytes and lymphocytes were purified from the peripheral blood of normal donors by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and separated by adherence to plastic .
Cells were exposed to 0.5 % ( v/v ) dimethyl sulfide ( Sigma ) for 4 min at room temperature and DNA extracted as previously described ( 24 ) .
In vivo footprints were visualized using the ligation-mediated-PCR procedure ( 25 ) .
The universal linker used in this amplification method is composed of two oligonucleotides : linker oligo 1 : GAATTCAGATC ; linker oligo 2 : GCGGTGACCCGGGA-GATCTGAATTC .
The specific oligonucleotides from the CD1lb promoter region coding strand were as follows : oligo 1 , used for first strand transcription , bp -196 to -172 of the CD11b promoter : GTGACAAATGGCACCTTTTGGATAG ; oligo 2 , used for PCR amplification , bp -156 to bp -132 ; AAGTTTGGGTCAGGA-AGCTGGGGAG ; and oligo 3 , kinased with [ y-*P ] ATP and used in primer extension for visualization of PCR products , bp -149 to bp -124 ; GGTCAGGAAGCTGGGGAGGAAGGGTG .
Specific oligonucleotides for the CD11b noncoding strand were as follows : oligo 1 , used for first strand transcription , bp +108 to +84 : TTAACAGAAG-GACTCTGAGAGCCAT ; oligo 2 , used for PCR amplification , bp +80 to bp +56 : TGGAAGGAGCCAGAACCTGGAAGGA ; and oligo 3 , kinased with [ y-P ] JATP and used in primer extension for visualization of PCR products , bp +78 to bp +52 : GAAGGAGCCAGA-ACCTGGAAGGAGGTG .
All oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis on 15 % nondenaturing acrylamide gels followed by purification using Elutip-D ( Schleicher & - Schuell ) columns . ``
Autoradiographs exposed in the linear range of the film were scanned * H.-M. Chen and D. G. Tenen , manuscript in preparation .

Ligation-mediated-PCR extensions stop at C residues because the template ends at a methylated and cleaved complementary G residue ; the footprinting gel shows bands at sequences corresponding to the presence of cytosines in the sequence of one strand but implies methylation at the corresponding guanosine residues on the complementary strand .
RESULTS Linker Scanning Analysis of the CD11b -92 bp Promoter Reveals an Essential Region Centered at bp -60-In order to determine sequences required for CD11b promoter activity , we constructed nine linker scanning mutations by inserting a 10-bp oligonucleotide linker consecutively every 10 bp in the promoter ( for sequences , see Fig .
1b ) .
We tested these constructs by transient transfection into U937 cells ( Fig .
la ) .
We have previously reported that mutation of bp -12 to -15 of the CD11b promoter disrupts a PU.1 binding site and decreases the 92-bp promoter activity 3-fold ( 12 ) .
This result was confirmed by the linker scanning mutant -15/-5 ( Fig .
1a ) , which retains only 54 % of the wild type promoter activity .
In addition , a significant decrease in CD11b promoter activity was seen when sequences between bp -65 and -55 , bp -55 and -45 and bp -45 and -35 were replaced ( Fig .
1a ) .
Since these constructs carry mutations at adjacent sequences , we hypothesized that they may each be partially disrupting a sequence required for promoter activity .
Since deletion of the entire region may have a greater effect on CD11b promoter activity than the individual linker scanning mutations , we constructed an additional mutant which substituted bp -75 to bp -45 with the oligonucleotide linker .
This mutant retains only 9 % of the wild type 92-bp CD11b promoter activity ( Fig .
1a ) .
We therefore concluded that sequences between bp -75 and -35 are essential for CD11b promoter activity and investigated whether transcription factors bound these sequences .
The Transcription Factor Sp1 Binds the CD11b Promoter at bp -60-We used an EMSA to investigate DNA-protein interactions in the CD11b promoter .
Nuclear extracts from U937 ( myeloid ) or HeLa ( non-myeloid ) cells were incubated with a 130-bp probe , which extends from bp -90 to bp +40 of the CD11b promoter .
In addition to the previously characterized complex formed by PU.1 ( 12 ) ( marked PU.1 in Fig .
2 , a and c ) , two complexes ( marked A and A `` ) specifically bind the CD11b promoter .
PU.1 is identified because the complex is competed by the addition of an oligonucleotide spanning the PU.1 site , bp -26 to +2 of the CD11b promoter ( 12 ) ( Fig .
2a , lane 5 ) , but not by addition of oligonucleotides spanning either bp -78 to -49 ( Fig .
2a , lane 2 ) or bp -114 to -85 , ( Fig .
2a , lane 4 ) .
The band immediately above the PU.1 band represents nonspecific binding to the probe , as it can not be competed by excess non-radioactive self competitor ( compare Fig .
2a , lane 6 ) .
Contrary to the PU.1 complex , which is seen only in U937 cell extracts ( compare Fig .
2a , lanes 1 and 8 ; Fig .
2¢ , lanes 1 and 2 ) , complexes A and A `` are present in both U937 and HeLa cell extracts ( Fig .
2a , lanes 1 and 8 ; Fig .
2b , lanes 1 and 5 ; Fig .
2¢ , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
They are competed by the addition of excess non-radioactive 130-bp CD11b promoter probe ( Fig .
2a , lane 6 ) as well as by the addition of an oligonucleotide spanning bp -78 to -49 of the promoter ( compare Fig .
20 , lanes 1 and 2 ; Fig .
2b , lanes 1 and 2 ; and Fig .
2¢ , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
A second oligonucleotide , also spanning bp -78 to -49 , but containing a 2-bp mutation at bp -60 and -61 ( see Fig .
2d ) , no longer competes the binding of complexes A and A `` ( Fig .
2a , lane 3 ; Fig .
2b , lane 3 ; Fig .
2¢ , lane 4 ) .
In addition , whereas the mutant oligonucleotide , when used as a probe , binds neither band A nor A ' , the wild type oligonucleotide binds both ( Fig .
2b , lanes 1 and 6 ) .
The sequence immediately surrounding bp -60 and -61 , Sp1 Is Essential for CD11b Promoter Activity and thus implicated in the formation of complexes A and A* , 5'-CCGCCC-3 ' , is found also at bp -100 of the CD11b promoter ( Fig .
2d ) .
Interestingly , an oligonucleotide spanning bp -114 to -85 neither competes for binding of complexes A and A `` ( Fig .
2a , lane 4 ; Fig .
2b , lane 4 ) , nor does it itself bind the complexes ( Fig .
2b , lane 7 ) .
Because the sequence between bp -64 and -59 , constitutes a consensus binding site for the transcription factor Spl ( 26 , 27 ) , we investigated whether complex A and A `` represent Sp1 binding by competing with a 97-bp DNA fragment of the tissue plasminogen promoter ( 18 ) containing two characterized Sp1-binding sites ( see Fig .
2d ) .
Fig .
2a , lane 7 , shows that both complexes A and A `` , but not the PU.1 complex , are competed by the addition of DNA containing Sp1-binding sites , suggesting that they represent Spl binding the CD11b promoter .
To investigate whether complex A consists only of the Spl transcription factor or perhaps contains additional DNA-binding proteins , we compared the binding of purified Spl and nuclear extracts in an EMSA .
Fig .
2¢ shows that when purified Sp1 protein ( lane 5 ) is bound to the CD11b promoter bp -90 to +40 probe , the predominant binding activity co-migrates with complex A formed by extracts from U937 and HeLa cells ( lanes 1 , 2 , and 4 ) .
The faint bands above the predominant band in lane 5 ( purified Sp1 ) are also visible in lane 1 , in which U937 nuclear extracts are used , and , on longer exposure of the gel , in lanes 2 and 4 , in which nuclear extracts from HeLa cells are used ( data not shown ) .
These complexes are competed by the addition of wild type bp -78 oligonucleotide , as lane 3 shows no bands even on long exposure of the gel ( data not shown ) .
These slowly migrating bands thus most likely represent multimeric complexes of Spl binding the CD11b promoter .
Multimeric binding of Spl has been observed on other promoters ( 18 ) .
This result suggests that complex A consists only of the Spl protein bound to the CD11b promoter and does not contain additional DNA-bind-ing proteins .
In order to confirm that complexes A and A* represent Sp1 binding , we used an antiserum against Spl , which was previously shown to induce `` supershifts `` of Spl complexes in an EMSA ( 18 ) .
Fig .
3 shows that addition of anti-Sp1 antiserum ( lane 2 ) , but not preimmune serum ( lane 3 ) results in a `` supershift `` ( marked S ) of band A , confirming that band A represents Spl binding the CD11b promoter .
Complex A `` does not supershift after addition of anti-Spl antiserum ; this complex may represent a proteolytically cleaved form of Spl , which is not recognized by the antibody , a differentially glycosylated form of Spl ( 28 ) , or it may represent a second , distinct protein binding the CD11b promoter .
In order to distinguish these possibilities , we performed methylation interference assays .
The wild type CD11b promoter oligonucleotide ( wt -78 , Fig .
2d ) was end labeled on the coding strand with [ y-P ] ATP , annealed with its complementary oligonucleotide , treated with limiting amounts of dimethyl sulfate , and then used in a preparative mobility shift assay .
Dimethyl sulfate methylates N-7 of guanines in the major groove of a DNA double helix , interfering with protein binding at this site ( 20 ) .
Partially methylated DNA was subjected to a preparative mobility shift assay , and DNA bound in complexes A and A* as well as unbound DNA subjected to cleavage with piperidine .
Fig .
4 demonstrates that complexes A and A `` made identical contacts on 2 G residues within the binding region ( bp -62 and -68 ) .
The same preparation of affinity purified Spl used in Fig .
2¢ , lane 5 , made precisely the same two contacts ( data not shown ) .
Similar experiments performed with DNA end labeled on the complementary noncoding oligonucleotide demonstrated that complexes A and A* made 00 Sp1 Is Essential for CD11b Promoter Activity luciferase = -- -- -- £22277777 % Activity 0 , haz R 20 eo - so % Activity LU & \\\\\\\\\\\\W 100 _ 1sezo 95/-85 [ | 61+/-22 _ 8492 /- 3062 85/-75 [ _ ] \\\\\ \\\\ 84 +/- 28 _ 11692 +/- 3897 \ \\\\\\\\\ 74 +/- 24 _ 10300 +/- 3340 -65/-55 S 19 +/-7 _ 2645 +/- 1044 757-45 - U 9 +3 - 1253 +/- 417 -55/-45 27 i/- 5 _ 3758 +/- 696 -45/-35 42 +/- 10 __ 5846 +/- 1392 -35/-25 127 +/- 44 _ 17678 +/- 6124 -25/-15 108 +/- 21 _ 15037 +/- 2923 45/5 54 +/- 28 _ 7517 +/- 3201 b CD11b -95/-85 wild type GaCCAGGCAG CD11b -95/-8 $ linker scan GGATCCCAGA 90 % CDL1b -85/-75 wild type GGCTaTGTGC CD11b -85/-75 linker scan GGATCCCAGA 60 % CDL1b -75/-65 wild type TCACTGAGCC 90 % CD11b -75/-65 linker scan GGATCCCAGA © CDL1b -65/-55 wild type TCCGCCCTCT 70 % CD11b -65/-55 linker scan GGATCCCAGA ° CD11b -55/-45 wild type TCCTTTGAAT 90 % CD1L1b -55/-45 linker sean -__ GGATCCCAGA o CD11b -45/-35 wild type CTCTGATAGA 60 % CD11b -45/-35 linker sean ___ GGATCCCAGA ° CD11b -35/-25 wild type ertctaeere 90 CD11b -35/-25 linker scan GGATCCCAGA % -25/-15 wild type cractreree 0 CD11b -25/-15 linker scan GGATCCCAGA 80 % CD11b -15/-5 wild type TTTTCTGCCC CD11b linker scan GGATCCCAGA 80 % 8233 FIG .

Linker scanning analysis of the 92-bp CD11b promoter .
Panel a , transient transfections of the 92-bp wild type CD11b promoter and 10 linker scanning mutants into TPA-induced U937 cells .
In the schematic , lines represent wild type sequences , and the linker oligonucleotide is represented by a square .
Four independent experiments were performed , and the average activities and standard errors relative to the 92-bp wild type promoter ( 100 % activity ) were calculated .
The average luciferase activity is reported in relative light units ( RLU ) , and results are normalized for transfection efficiency as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
Background luciferase activity , obtained from transfection of the promoterless pXP2 parent plasmid , was 320 RLU .
Panel b , sequence replacements obtained in individual linker scanning mutations .
Sequence of the wild type and the linker scanning mutations in the replaced positions are shown .
The percent change from wild type sequence is depicted on the right .
identical contacts on 4 G residues within the binding region at bp -63 and at bp -61 to -59 ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that complexes A , A* , and affinity purified Spl bind this site in a similar manner , supporting the hypothesis that A `` represents a derivative of complex A ( Sp1 ) .
The Sp1 Site Is Essential for CD11b Promoter Activity-After identifying both the Spl-binding site in the CD11b promoter and a two-bp mutation , which no longer binds Sp1 ( Fig .
2 ) , we tested whether mutation of the Sp1 site entirely accounts for the loss of promoter activity seen in linker scanning mutations -65/-55 , -55/-45 , -45/-35 , and -75/ -45 ( Fig .
1 ) .
We introduced the same two-bp mutation of the Sp1 site at bp -60 and -61 into the 412 bp promoter , which has maximal activity in transient transfection assays ( 11 ) , and transiently transfected both the wild type and the mutant construct into U937 and HeLa cells .
Fig .
5 shows that in U937 cells , the two-bp mutation at bp -60 and -61 causes an 18-fold decrease over wild type CD11b promoter activity .

The -78 to -49 oligonucleotide ( Fig .

2 ng of probe were incubated with 5 ug of U937 nuclear extract in a preparative mobility shift assay as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
Complexes A , A ' `` , and the free ( unbound ) probe were isolated , subjected to piperidine-mediated cleavage of methylated G residues , and analyzed by electrophoresis on 8 M urea , 15 % polyacrylamide ( 19:1 ) gels followed by autoradiography at -80 °C with intensifying screens .

cells , where the CD11b promoter is significantly less active , mutation of the Sp1 site decreased the low-level CD11b promoter activity 10-fold ( Fig .

The strong effect of this mutation in the context of the entire 412-bp promoter suggests that the Sp1 site is essential not only for the activity of the 92-bp promoter ( Fig .
1 ) , but that there are no other factors present in the 412-bp promoter which can compensate for the loss of promoter activity following mutation of the Spl site .

Mutation of the Spl site significantly reduces CD11b promoter activity .
The wild type 412-bp CD11b promoter or the promoter carrying a 2-bp mutation in the Spl site ( Fig .

Transfections were carried out in duplicate , and the average and standard error relative to the wild type 412-bp promoter in U937 cells ( 100 % activity ) of four experiments is shown .
Luciferase activity is reported in relative light units ( RLU ) , and results are normalized for transfection efficiency with a cotransfected growth hormone plasmid as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``

Spl stimulates transcription of the CD11b promoter at the -60 bp site in transactivation assays .
Drosophila Schneider S2 cells were transfected with the wild type -412 CD11b-lucif-erase reporter , the Sp1 ( bp -60 and -61 ) mutant reporter , or the wild type and mutant reporters cotransfected with the pPacSpl expression construct , as indicated by the legend to the left of the figure .
Luciferase activity was measured 14 h after transfection and is displayed on the figure as percent of the activity obtained by cotransfection of the wild type reporter with the Spl expression vector .
The relative light units/nanogram of growth hormone activity ( to normalize for transfection efficiency ) are given on the right hand side of the figure ( RLU ) .

7 ) , can not replace the function of the Sp1-binding site at bp -60 .
To demonstrate directly that Sp1 can bind to and activate the CD11b promoter , we cotransfected CD11b reporter constructs with a Sp1 expression vector ( pPac§Sp1 ) into Drosophila Schneider ( $ 2 ) cells , which , unlike most mammalian cells , lack endogenous Sp1 .
When the pPac§Spl construct was cotransfected with the wild type -412-bp CD11b reporter construct , luciferase activity increased 6-fold ( Fig .
6 ) .
No increase in luciferase activity was seen in the absence of the pPacSpl construct , when the two-bp mutation at bp -60 and -61 ( Fig .
2d ) was introduced into the 412-bp CD11b promoter , or when a retinoic acid receptor a expression plasmid was cotransfected with the wild type CD11b luciferase reporter ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the expression of the Sp1 protein and excess over probe : lane 3 , wild type bp -78 oligo ; lane 4 , mutant bp -78 oligo .

Nucleotides altered in the bp -78 to -49 mutant oligonucleotide are marked with asterisks , and the core binding region for the Sp1 transcription factor is underlined .
The CD11b sequences in the -114 to -85 region are presented as the noncoding strand so as to facilitate visual comparison with the CD11b -60 site as well as the tissue plasminogen activator site .
8236 an intact Sp1l-binding site at bp 60 and 61 were specifically necessary for an increase in luciferase activity .
These observations and the data obtained in EMSAs ( Fig .
2 ) are consistent with the model that Sp1 binds to and activates the CD11b promoter , and that Sp1 binding is essential for CD11b promoter activity .
Sp1 Binds the CD11b Promoter Selectively in Myeloid Cells in Vivo-In order to fully characterize the Sp1-binding site , we performed in vitro and in vivo footprinting assays .
In both EMSAs and in vitro footprinting assays , protein-DNA interactions occur on short , plasmid-derived DNA fragments in vitro and may thus not accurately reflect binding reactions occurring on promoters embedded in chromosomal structures in vivo .
For example , in vitro the muscle creatine kinase promoter binds myoD when nuclear extracts from either myoblasts or myocytes are used .
In vivo , however , these sites are only bound in myocytes ( 25 ) .
Thus , in vivo footprinting may more accurately reflect protein-DNA binding reactions occurring on chromatin in intact cells .
We therefore compared occupancy of the Sp1 site in myeloid ( U937 ) and non-myeloid ( HeLa ) nuclear extracts or in intact cells using both in vitro and in vivo footprinting .
In vitro , sequences between bp -55 and -86 on the coding strand and bp -52 and -73 on the non-coding strand are protected from DNase I digestion when incubated with either U937 or HeLa cell extracts ( Fig .
7 ) .
In contrast , in vivo , only U937 cells show protection from dimethyl sulfide methylation between bp -54 and -70 ( Fig .
8 , a and b , lane 2 ; Fig .
8¢ , lane 2 ; Fig .
9a , lanes 1 and 2 ) ; no in vivo footprint is seen in HeLa cells ( Figs .
8 and 9 ) , in which the pattern generated precisely corresponds to that produced by naked genomic DNA ( Fig .
8 , a and b , lanes 1 and 3 ; Fig .
8¢ , lanes 1 and 5 ) .
This in vivo binding activity is present in both uninduced U937 cells ( Fig .
8a , lane 2 ; Fig .
9a , lane 1 ) , as well as U937 cells induced toward monocytic differentiation with TPA ( Fig .
8¢ , lane 2 ) .
In addition , the myeloid-specific in vivo binding is observed in peripheral blood monocytes ( Fig .
8¢ , lane 3 ) , but not in lymphocytes ( Fig .
8¢ , lane 4 ) ; therefore , the binding is observed in normal cells as well as cell lines .
We have previously demonstrated that a 92-bp CD11b promoter construct directs `` tissue-specific `` expression of luciferase constructs in cell lines ( 11 ) .
Examination of the entire -92 bp region on the non-coding strand demonstrated only one additional site consistently protected from in vivo meth-ylation , and this was located at bp -17 and -19 , adjacent to a hypersensitive site located at bp -16 ( Fig .
9 , b and c ) .

In summary , whereas the Spl site is bound in vitro by nuclear extracts from both CD11b expressing U937 and non-expressing HeLa cells , in vivo only CD11b-expressing U937 cells and monocytes show Spl binding ; protection and/or hypersensitive sites were also observed at the PU.1-binding site at bp -20 and at an as yet uncharacterized site at bp -112 .

DISCUSSION Although Sp1 is universally expressed and has often been implicated in the transcription of TATA-less , `` housekeeping `` promoters ( 26 , 29 , 30 ) , recent evidence suggests that Spl expression ( 31 ) , binding affinity ( 32 ) , and post-translational modifications ( 28 , 33 ) may be modulated so as to confer tissue-specific and developmental regulation ( 34 ) on target genes .
Moreover , although Spl is ubiquitously expressed , levels of Sp1 expression vary greatly among tissues ; developing hematopoietic cells contain among the highest levels of Spl mRNA and protein ( 31 ) .
Furthermore , Spl is phosphorylated and differentially glycosylated in various cell types , allowing additional modulation of activity ( 28 , 33 ) .

Summary of in vitro EMSA and footprinting , methylation interference , and in vivo footprinting data .
The CD11b promoter sequence ( 11 ) on both coding and noncoding strands is represented from bp -160 to bp +80 , and from bp +81 to bp +122 on the coding strand only ; bp +1 to +83 represents the 5'-untranslated region , and bp +84 to bp +112 ( in italics ) encodes the first 10 amino acids of the leader sequence ( presented in one-letter code below the DNA sequence ) ; bp +113 to +122 represents the first 10 bases of the first intron ( 38 ) .
Vertical bars between strands ( | ) denote every 10 bases .
Arrowheads indicate the potential sites for DNA binding factors .
The `` consensus `` sequences GAGGAA at bp -130 , GGGCGG at bp -100 , and TGATAG at bp -40 , representing potential PU.1 , Spl , and GATA factor-binding sites , are underlined and labeled in quotation marks ; these sites do not bind their respective factors in vitro and in vivo , and mutations in these sites do not significantly affect CD11b promoter activity ( 11 , 12 , this manuscript ) .
The symbols used to denote DNA binding results are presented in the inset and represent combined data from Ref .
12 and this manuscript .
moter , like the tissue plasminogen activator promoter and other promoters regulated by the Spl transcription factor , does not contain a TATA box ( 11 , 18 , 30 ) .
However , unlike certain other TAT housekeeping promoters , the CD11b promoter is highly regulated both developmentally and in a tissue-specific manner ( 11 ) .
We show here that an Spl site at bp -60 of the myeloid-specific CD11b promoter is essential for promoter activity .
It is interesting that the sequence 5¢-CCGCCC-3 ' , which occurs twice in the CD11b promoter ( at bp -60 and bp -100 ) , only binds Spl at bp -60 ( Fig .
2 ) .
In vivo footprinting implicates additional base pairs outside the CCCGCC consensus in contacting Sp1 .
These are not shared by the site around bp -100 ( Figs .
2d and Fig .
11 ) and may thus be essential for Spl binding .
Although this Sp1 site is bound in vitro by nuclear extracts from either myeloid ( U937 ) or non-myeloid ( HeLa ) cells , in vivo the Spl site is only occupied in CD11b-expressing myeloid cells .
Chromatin structure may play a role in such a mechanism .
In vivo , the Spl site in the CD11b promoter may be inaccessible in non-myeloid cells ; in myeloid cells , however , binding of tissue-specific factors , such as PU.1 , may render the site accessible to Sp1 binding .
Rigaud et al .
( 35 ) have suggested a hit-and-run mechanism of transcriptional activation , whereby chromatin structure is altered by the transient binding of a transcription factor .
This factor rapidly dissociates from the DNA , leaving the site accessible for a second binding factor .
In the CD11b promoter , chromatin structure at the Spl site may be altered by transient or stable binding of a myeloid-specific factor .
After binding of this factor , the site becomes accessible to Sp1 in myeloid ( U937 ) cells .
In this model ( Fig .
12 ) , HeLa cells lack the myeloid-specific binding activity , the chromatin structure in these cells remains unaltered , and the binding site is inaccessible to Spl .
A leading candidate for this myeloid-specific activity is PU.1 , which binds to and activates the CD11b promoter through an adjacent site ( 12 ) , and binds to that site in vivo ( Fig .
9 ) .
Alternatively , Spl may interact with additional , lineage-specific , non-DNA-binding proteins to confer myeloid-specific binding , or the protein may be specifically modified in myeloid cells .
We have found no experimental evidence to support this latter possibility .
We have observed no differences in protein-DNA complexes on EMSAs or Southwestern blots , or phosphorylation of Spl , comparing uninduced and differentiated U937 and HL-60 and HeLa nuclear extracts ( data not shown ) .
Although Darrow et al .
( 18 ) have implicated Spl in the retinoic acid-induced expression of the tissue plasminogen activator gene and expression of the myeloid surface antigen CD11b , like tissue plasminogen activator , is induced by retinoic acid , we see no change in Spl binding in vitro or in vivo following differentiation of U937 cells induced with either retinoic acid or TPA ( Fig .
8 , and data not shown ) .
In addition , mutation of the Sp1 site does not abrogate either retinoic acid Sp1 Is Essential for CD11b Promoter Activity a. CD11b LP ss J/PUJ b. CD11b PV.1 U c. CD11b Pu.1 > AF L_ J/ Sp1 a. cbiib __ SP1 PUA Fic .

Model of mechanism of myeloid-specific binding of Spl to the CD11b promoter in the presence of PU.1 .
Panel a , we hypothesize that prior to commitment of stem cells to myeloid progenitors , neither Spl nor PU.1 bind to the CD11b promoter , and activity is undetectable ( small arrow ) .
Panel b , once cells become committed to myeloid progenitors , PU.1 binds to the promoter and transcription becomes detectable , although at low level .
Panel c , PU.1 induces a change in chromatin structure , so that ( panel d ) Spl can now bind to the promoter and higher level activity is observed .
Steps a-d occur at the promyelocytic ( HL-60 ) or promonocytic ( U937 ) stage ; further increases of CD11b promoter activity seen with monocytic or neutrophilic differentiation ( 11 , 12 ) proceeds via additional mecha-nisms , since Sp1 and PU.1 DNA binding do not increase with myeloid differentiation ( 12 ; Fig .
8 ; R. J. Scheibe , H. L. Pahl , and D. G. Tenen , manuscript in preparation ) .
or TPA-induced up-regulation of CD11b promoter activity following transient transfection ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that Sp1 does not mediate the increase in CD11b expression and transcription rate observed after monocytic differentiation of U937 cells ( 11 ) .
In the future , it will be interesting to see whether potential Spl-binding sites in other myeloid-specific promoters , such as CD13 ( 36 ) and cathepsin G ( 37 ) , also play a major role in regulating transcription of these genes .
If so , and if these Spl sites are also bound specifically in myeloid cells in vivo , a 8239 general mechanism by which Spl binds selectively in certain tissues , or , conversely , is prevented from binding in other tissues , may be derived .
More generally , a hypothesis may be derived how universally expressed transcription factors may regulate the transcription of tissue-specific target genes .
