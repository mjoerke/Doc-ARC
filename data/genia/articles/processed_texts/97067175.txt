Identification and Characterization of a Leukocyte-specific Component of the Nuclear Body* ( Received for publication , March 28 , 1996 , and in revised form , July 30 , 1996 ) Donald B. Bloch # § , Suzanne M. de la Monte1 , Pavel Guigaourit , Andrew Filippovti , and Kenneth D. Bloch From the Department of Medicine , Harvard Medical School and the $ Arthritis Unit , Cardiovascular Research Center , and the Division of Neuropathology , Cancer Center , of the General Medical Services , Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts 02129 The nuclear body ( NB ) is a cellular organelle that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infection .
The NB is also a target of antibodies in the serum of patients with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis .
In this study , serum from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis was used to identify a cDNA encoding a novel component of the NB , a 140-kDa protein designated Sp140 .
The predicted amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal portion of Sp140 was similar to Sp100 , a previously identified NB protein .
The carboxyl portion of Sp1l40 contained a zinc-finger domain and a bromodomain , motifs that are present in proteins regulating gene transcription .
High levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes , but not other human tissues .
The level of SP140 mRNA in myeloid precursor cell lines HL60 and NB4 markedly increased in response to chemically induced cellular differentiation .
Immunohistochemical techniques were used to demonstrate that SP140 localized to the NB in differentiated HL60 and NB4 cells .
The location of Sp140 in the NB , and expression of this gene in cells involved in host defense , suggest that Sp140 may be involved in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infection .
The nuclear body ( NB !
; also known as nuclear domain 10 , PML oncogenic domain , and Kr body ) is a nuclear organelle whose function is unknown ( 1-3 ) .
Using immunohistochemical staining , NBs appear as 5-30 discrete , punctate , dotlike regions within the nucleus .
The NB is distinct from other nuclear domains including those involved in DNA replication and * This work was supported in part by United States Public Health Service Grants ARO1866 and DK51179 ( to D. B .

In addition , components of the NB do not co-localize with kinetochores or centromeres ( 2 ) .
The number of NBs in the cell and the intensity of antibody staining of these structures increase in response to stimuli including interferons ( IFNs ) , heat shock , and viral infection ( 1 ) .
The NB is a target of autoantibodies in the serum of patients with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) .
Approximately 40 % of patients with PBC have antibodies directed against this structure ( 4 , 5 ) .
Serum from patients with PBC was used to identify and characterize a 100-kDa component of the NB which was designated Sp100 ( Speckled , 100-kDa ) ( 6 ) .
Xie et al .
( 7 ) demonstrated that fusion of Sp100 to the LexA DNA binding domain activated gene transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
The authors suggested that Sp100 may participate in activation of transcription of specific regions in the genome ( 7 ) .
A second component of the NB , designated NDP52 , was characterized using a murine monoclonal antibody that reacted with the NB ( 1 , 8 ) .
A cDNA encoding NDP52 was identified , and the predicted amino acid sequence contained coiled-coil , leucine zipper , and zinc-finger motifs .
One or more of these domains may be involved in interactions between NDP52 and other components of the NB ( 8 ) .
A third component of the NB , designated PML , was identified by several investigators studying the t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) ( 9-12 ) .
In this translocation , the amino-terminal portion of PML is fused to the retinoic acid receptor- ( RAR- @ ) .
PML was found to co-localize with Sp100 in the NB ( 13 , 14 ) .
Expression of the PML-RAR-a fusion protein in APL cells appeared to disrupt the NB ; in these cells , the NB antigens were detected in numerous smaller regions in the nucleus described as `` microspeckles . ``
Treatment of APL cells with retinoic acid ( RA ) resulted in differentiation of myeloid precursor cells and reformation of NBs ( 3 , 13 , 14 ) .
In patients with APL , treatment with RA results in differentiation of leukemic cells and temporary disease remission ( 15 ) .
PML , like Sp100 and NDP52 , is expressed in a wide variety of human cell lines .
Immunoreactive PML was detected in myeloid precursor cells as well as erythroblasts and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow ( 16 ) .
In addition , PML was detected in psoriatic skin lesions , hyperplastic breast and colon tissues , and in the endometrial mucosa during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle ( 17 ) .
In recent studies , Sternsdorf et al .
( 18 ) demonstrated that PML , like Sp100 , is a target of autoantibodies in patients with PBC .
Expression of the three previously identified components of the NB is enhanced by treatment with IFNs ( 8 , 19 , 20 ) .
Guldner et ol .
( 19 ) suggested that enhanced expression of Sp100 by IFNs reflects a role for Sp100 in the `` anti-viral state . ``
Doucas et al .
( 20 ) demonstrated that IFN-induced expression of PML in HEp2 cells This paper is available on line at http : //www-jbc.stanford.edu/jbe/ 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Sp 140 Component of the Nuclear Body was associated with inhibition of adenovirus replication .
The NB is a site of interaction between viral and host proteins .
Maul et al .
( 21 ) and Maul and Everett ( 22 ) demonstrated that infection of cells with herpes simplex virus type I resulted in disruption of the NB .
Using herpes simplex virus type I deletion mutants , disruption of the nuclear body was shown to be a result of the action of the viral protein ICPO .
Recent studies have demonstrated that other viral proteins , including the adenovirus E4-ORF3 protein , also interact with this nuclear organelle ( 20 , 23 , 24 ) .
In this study , serum from a patient with PBC was used to identify a cDNA encoding a third autoantigen in the NB .
In keeping with the nomenclature introduced for Sp100 and because the protein has an apparent molecular weight of 140 kDa , the protein was designated Sp140 .
High levels of mRNA encoding Sp140 were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes .
As with the other components of the NB , IFN treatment enhanced expression of Sp140 .
In addition , high levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in myeloid precursor cell lines after chemically induced cellular differentiation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Human Serum-Serum was obtained from a patient with PBC .
The diagnosis was based on the presence of elevated liver function enzymes and high titer antibodies directed against the mitochondrial antigen E2-pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( 25 ) .
Cell Culture and Induction of Differentiation-HLGO cells ( American Type Tissue Collection , Rockville , MD ) and NBA4 cells ( a gift of M. Lanotte , Institut National de la Sante et Recherche Medicale , Paris , France ) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , L-gluta-mine ( 2 mM ) , penicillin ( 200 units/ml ) , and streptomycin ( 200 ug/ml ) .
Differentiation of HL6O cells toward monocytes was induced by the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 18-acetate ( PMA ; 2 x 10~* M ) .
Differentiation of HL6O cells toward polymorphonuclear leukocytes was induced by incubation with dimethyl sulfoxide ( Me , S80O ; 1.2 % ) ( 26 , 27 ) .
The effect of IFN on the expression of Sp140 in HL6O cells was studied by incubating these cells in the presence of IFN-y ( 200 units/ml ) .
Differentiation of NB4 cells was induced by treatment for 5 days with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ; 1 uM ) ( 28 ) .
Immunohistochemical Staining-Adherent cells were grown in tissue culture chambers ( Nunc , Inc. , Naperville , IL ) and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 15 min .
Cytospin preparation of nonadherent cells was performed with 50,000 cells at 500 rpm for 5 min followed by air drying and fixation in paraformaldehyde .
Prior to incubation with antibodies , cells were permeabilized with 0.1 % saponin in phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with 0.6 % hydrogen peroxide in 60 % methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity .
Cells were immunostained with mouse monoclonal antibody directed against PML ( a gift of K. van Der Kraan , E. C. Slater Instituut , Amsterdam ) ( 29 ) or rat antiserum directed against Sp140 using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin-biotin complexes ( ABC ) ( Vector ABC Elite Kit ; Vector Laboratories ) .
In some experiments , cells were stained with rat anti-Sp140 antibodies that were affinity-purified using recombinant protein ( see below ) .
Cells incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody and biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG antiserum were subsequently exposed to either TruBlue peroxidase substrate ( Kirkegaard-Perry Laboratories , Inc. , Gaithers-burg , MD ) , which resulted in blue staining or 3,3'-diaminobenzimide ( DAB ) which produced a brown precipitate .
Similarly , cells incubated with rat anti-SP140 antiserum and biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG antiserum were treated with either TruBlue peroxidase substrate or DAB .
Control studies included immunostaining with preimmune rat serum and anti-Sp140 antibodies preasbsorbed with recombinant protein ( see below ) .
Double immunostaining reactions were used to determine the cellular location of Sp140 relative to PML .
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ABC and DAB ( brown chromagen ) were used to detect PML , and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated ABC and PhThalo Blue ( Kirkegaard-Perry Laboratories , Inc. ) were used to detect Sp140 .
Isolation and Preliminary Analysis of cDNA Clones-Patient serum diluted 1:200 in blocking solution ( phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 % nonfat dry milk , pH 7.4 ) was used to screen a AGT11L cDNA expression library prepared from HepG2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells ( Clontech ) ( 30 ) .
One clone expressing immunoreactive protein was isolated from approximately one million bacteriophages .
The cDNA 29199 clone ( Sp140.1 ) was radiolabeled and used to screen a AGT1O human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) cDNA library ( 81 ) .
One positive clone ( 8p140.2 ) was identified .
Amplification of the 5 ' end of the cDNA encoding Sp140 was performed using the 5'-RACE system ( Life Technologies Inc. ) ( 82 ) and cDNA prepared from human placenta ( Clon-tech ) .
The first polymerase chain reaction used an 18-nucleotide primer ( GSP1 : 5'-CCTGAGGCACTGCTATAT-3 ' ) and the anchor primer supplied by the manufacturer .
A second , `` nested `` oligonucleotide with a 5 ' EcoRI site ( GSP2 : 5'-CGGAATTCGAAATGGCCTTGTTATTG-3 ' ) was used with a second anchor primer ( modified to include an EcoRI site ) to further amplify the product .
The polymerase chain reaction product was treated with EcoRI and ligated into pUC19 .
The nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs and two independent 5'-RACE products were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method ( 83 ) .
In Vitro Transcription and Translation of Sp140-To create a full-length cDNA encoding Sp140 , a KprnUBstY¥I fragment of the 5-RACE product and a BsfYU/EcoRI fragment of cDNA Sp140.2 were ligated into the KpnI and EcoRI sites in eukaryotic expression vector pCDNAS ( Invitrogen Corp. , San Diego , CA ) to create plasmid pCDNAS8-Sp140 .
The plasmid was used in the TnT Reticulocyte Lysate System ( Promega Corp. , Madison , WI ) to produce in vitro translated protein .
Production of Rat Antiserum-Male Sprague-Dawley rats were immunized with recombinant protein containing Sp140 amino acids 131-391 fused to glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) .
The plasmid encoding this portion of Sp140 was prepared by ligating eDNA Sp140.1 into the EcoRI site of the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX ( Pharmacia Bio-tech Inc. ) .
The plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli , and expression of the fusion protein was induced by treatment with isopro-pyl-1-thio-6-D-galactopyranoside .
The 110-kDa fusion protein was purified from E. coli proteins as described by Smith and Johnson ( 84 ) .
Primary immunization of three rats was performed using 50 ug of purified protein emulsified in complete Freund 's adjuvant for each animal .
Two subsequent booster injections consisting of 50 ug of protein were given at 2-week intervals .
Rat antibodies directed against Sp140 were affinity-purified using nitrocellulose-bound recombinant protein as described by Olmsted ( 85 ) .
The GST-Sp140- ( 181-391 ) fusion protein was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose as described below .
The membrane was incubated in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature and was then incubated with rat antiserum diluted 1:10 in blocking solution .
Bound antibodies were eluted by treatment with 100 mM glycine-HCl ( pH 2.5 ) for 10 min at room tem-perature .
The antibody solution was neutralized by addition of 1 M Tris buffer ( pH 8.8 ) .
Affinity-purified antibodies were concentrated using an Amicon concentrator ( W. R. Grace and Co. , Beverly , MA ) .
To confirm the specificity of anti-Sp140 antibodies , rat antiserum ( or affinity-purified anti-Sp140 antibodies ) were preincubated with 10 ug of purified , recombinant protein for 1 h at room temperature prior to use in immunoblot or immunohistochemistry .
SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting-Me , SO-treated HL60 cells were lysed in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( 1 mM ) , leupeptin ( 2 uM ) , and pepstatin A ( 1 uM ) .
Me , SO-treated HL6O cell lysates or reticulocyte lysates containing in vitro translated protein were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer ( 0.125 m Tris-HCl , 4 % SDS , 20 % glycerol , 10 % B-mercap-toethanol ) .
Proteins were fractionated in 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli ( 86 ) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( 87 ) .
Membranes were incubated in blocking solution at room temperature for 1 h and were then incubated in human serum diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution .
Bound antibodies were visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A ( Amersham ) and enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) .
For studies using rat antiserum , membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in antiserum diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution .
Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antiserum ( Amersham ) and chemiluminescence .
RNA Blot Hybridization-The level of mRNA encoding Sp140 in human tissues was determined by hybridizing membranes contained 2.5 ug of poly ( A ) *-selected RNA from human tissues ( multiple tissue Northern blots , Clontech Laboratories ) with a `` P-radiolabeled Sacl-EcoRI fragment of Sp140 ( bp 2,089-2,905 ) .
Membranes were washed under stringent conditions and were exposed to autoradiography for 9 h. To confirm the presence of poly ( A ) *-selected RNA in each lane , the membranes were hybridized with a *°P-radiolabeled B-actin cDNA .
The membranes were washed under stringent conditions and exposed to autoradiography for 30 min .
RNA was extracted from human cell lines using the guanidium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method ( 88 ) .
RNA was fractionated in 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 29200 formaldehyde-agarose gels ( 10 pg/lane ) and transferred to nylon mem-branes .
Membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled Sacl/EcoRI restriction fragment of the Sp140 cDNA .
Membranes were washed and subjected to autoradiography .
To confirm comparable loading of RNA in each lane , membranes were hybridized with a 10-fold molar excess of a °°P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide complementary to rat 18 S RNA ( 89 ) .
RESULTS Isolation of a cDNA Encoding Sp140-Patients with the autoimmune disease PBC produce autoantibodies directed against proteins in the nuclear body .
To identify novel components of this structure , serum from a patient with PBC was used to screen a AGT11 cDNA expression library prepared from HEpG2 cells .
Among approximately one million bacterio-phages , one clone ( §Sp140.1 ) producing immunoreactive recombinant protein was identified .
The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was found to contain a 781-bp open reading frame ( ORF ) that extended for the entire length of the fragment , suggesting that the cDNA encoded only a portion of a protein .
To identify a full-length cDNA , the DNA fragment was radiolabeled and used to rescreen the HEpG2 cDNA library ; no additional clones were identified .
The radiolabeled fragment was then used to screen a HUVEC cDNA library , and a single hybridizing cDNA ( Sp140.2 ) was identified among one million bacteriophages .
The clone contained a 2,732-bp insert that included the entire length of Sp140.1 .
A 2,193-nucleotide ORF extended to the 5 end of Sp140.2 , suggesting that this clone also encoded only part of the full-length protein .
The 5'-RACE technique was used to identify the 5 end of the mRNA encoding Sp140 .
The RACE product contained an additional 173-bp segment .
The polymerase chain reaction product and the 5 end of Sp140.2 were joined at a BsfYI !
site , and the full-length cDNA was ligated into eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3 .
To confirm that the isolated cDNA encoded a protein that reacted with autoantibodies in the patient 's serum , the plasmid was used for in vitro transcription and translation of Sp140 .
Autoantibodies in the patient 's serum reacted with the 140-kDa translation product by immunoblot ( Fig .
1 , panel A , + lane ) .
In contrast , this band was not detected in a lane containing reticulocyte lysate proteins alone ( Fig .
1 , panel A , - lane ) .
These results demonstrated that pCDNA3-Sp140 encoded an immunoreactive protein .
Sequence Analysis of Sp140-The cDNA encoding Sp140 was 2,905 bp in length and contained an ORF from 107 to 2,365 ( Fig .
2A ) .
The start codon was preceded by an in-frame stop codon .
Several features of the predicted amino acid sequence of Sp140 were of interest .
The amino-terminal portion of Sp140 , between amino acids 29 and 157 , was 49 % identical to the amino-terminal region of Sp100 , a previously identified autoantigen within the NB ( Fig .
2B ) .
The region in Sp140 between amino acids 228-317 was strongly negatively charged .
Twenty-nine of the 92 amino acids in this region were either glutamic or aspartic acid .
The central portion of Sp140 , between amino acids 381-400 , contained a potential bipartite nuclear localization sequence ( 40-42 ) .
The carboxyl portion of Sp140 contained a cysteine-rich , zinc-finger motif ( amino acids 579-639 ) .
This region was followed by a segment ( amino acids 681-715 ) that was similar to the bromodomain in S. cerevisiae protein BDF1 ( Fig .
2C ) ( 48-45 ) .
The presence of a strongly negatively charged region , zinc-finger motif and bromodomain suggested that Sp140 may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription .
Expression of Sp140 in Human Tissues and Cell Lines-The expression of the gene encoding Sp140 in human tissues was analyzed by RNA blot hybridization .
High levels of Sp1l40 mRNA were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes ( Fig .
3 ) .
In contrast , much lower levels of Sp140 mRNA were observed in thymus , prostate , ovary , small intes-tine , and colon .

Immunoblot of the in vitro translation product of the Sp140 cDNA .
Antibodies in human serum reacted with the 140-kDa translation product , as well as other reticulocyte lysate proteins ( A , + lane ) .
In contrast , the 140-kDa band was not detected in a lane containing only reticulocyte lysate proteins ( A , - lane ) .
Rat antiserum directed against Sp140 ( amino acids 181-391 ) also reacted with the 140-kDa translation product ( B .
+ lane ) but not with reticulocyte lysate proteins ( B , - lane ) .
possibly an alternatively spliced form of Sp140 mRNA , were detected in several tissues .
In addition , a 1,200-nucleotide transcript of uncertain significance was detected in human testis .
Very low levels of Sp140 mRNA were observed in human heart , brain , placenta , lung , liver , skeletal muscle , kidney , and pancreas ( data not shown ) .
To investigate the expression of Sp140 in cells of the monocyte/granulocyte lineage , RNA was prepared from the myeloid precursor cell lines HL60 and NB4 before and after induction of cellular differentiation .
Treatment of HL60 cells with Me,8O induces a polymorphonuclear leukocyte morphology ; treatment with PMA induces a monocyte-like morphology ( 26 , 27 ) .
Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in untreated HL60 cells ( Fig .
4 , lanes 1 and 4 ) .
The level of mRNA was increased by treatment of HL6O cells with either PMA ( Zane 2 ) or Me , SO ( lane 5 ) .
Treatment of human APL cell line NB4 with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) is also associated with cellular differentiation ( 28 ) .
Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in NB4 cells prior to treatment with RA ( Fig .
4 , lane 7 ) .
In contrast , 5 days after addition of RA ( 1 pM ) , the level of Sp1l40 mRNA was markedly increased ( Zane 8 ) .
These results demonstrated that differentiation of HL60 and NB4 cells was associated with increased expression of Sp140 .
IFN Treatment Induces Expression of Sp140-The expression of previously characterized components of the NB was enhanced by treatment of cells with IFN ( 8 , 17 , 19 , 20 ) .
To investigate the effect of IFN on the level of Sp140 mRNA , HL6O cells were treated with IFN-y ( 200 units/ml ) .
Increased Sp140 mRNA levels were detected 24 h after treatment and persisted for at least 4 days ( Fig .
5 ) .
In addition , treatment with IFN-y further increased Sp140 mRNA in cells treated with PMA ( Fig .
4 , lane 3 ) or ( Fig .
4 , lane 6 ) .
These results demonstrated that , as with Sp100 , NDP52 , and PML , expression of Sp140 was enhanced by IFN-y .
Cellular Localization of Sp140-To permit cellular localization of Sp140 by immunohistochemical techniques , antiserum directed against a recombinant fragment of the protein was prepared .

After washing under stringent conditions , the membrane was exposed to autoradiography .
High levels of mRNA encoding Sp140 were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes .
To confirm the presence of RNA in each lane , the membrane was subsequently hybridized with a human B-actin cDNA probe .

Expression of Sp140 mRNA in myeloid precursor cell lines .
Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in HL6O cells ( Zanes I and 4 ) .
Treatment of HL6O0 cells with PMA ( Zane 2 ) or Me,580 ( lane 5 ) markedly increased Sp140 gene expression .
The level of Sp140 mRNA was further increased by combinations of PMA and IFN-y ( Zane 3 ) or Me , S50 and IFN-y ( Zane 6 ) .
Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in NB4 cells ( Zane 7 ) .
After 5 days of incubation with RA , the level of Sp140 mRNA was markedly increased ( Zane 8 ) .
To confirm comparable loading of RNA in each lane , membranes were hybridized with a 10-fold molar excess of *°P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide complimentary to 18 S RNA .

These results demonstrated that rat antiserum reacted with Sp140 .
Although the region of Sp140 used to immunize rats contained a short segment that was similar to Sp100 ( 9 of 27 amino acids identical ) , the rat antiserum did not react with Sp100 by im-munoblot .
In addition , rat antiserum did not stain NBs in HEp2 cells , a cell line that contains high levels of Sp100 , but only very low levels of Sp140 ( data not shown ) .
To determine the cellular location of Sp140 , affinity-purified rat anti-Sp1l40 antibodies were prepared and used to stain Me , SO-treated HL6O cells .

Serum from a rat immunized with a fusion protein containing GST-Sp140- ( 131-391 ) reacted with a 140-kDa protein in Me,50-treated HL6O cells ( lane 1 ) .
In contrast , normal rat serum did not react with this protein ( data not shown ) .
Rat antiserum preincubated with recombinant protein did not react with Sp140 ( lane 2 ) .
This is the same pattern as that produced by mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against PML ( panel B ) .
Pretreatment of rat anti-Sp1l40 antibodies with recombinant protein completely blocked the NB staining pattern ( panel C ) .
Two-color immuno-histochemistry demonstrated that rat anti-Sp1l40 antibodies and mouse anti-PML antibodies localized to the same structures in individual cells ( panel D ) .
To investigate the cellular distribution of Sp140 in APL cell line NB4 , rat antiserum was used to stain NB4 cells before and after treatment with RA .
Rat antiserum directed against Sp140 stained NBs in NB4 cells that were treated for 5 days with RA ( Fig .

DISCUSSION Patients with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis produce antibodies directed against components of a cellular organelle known as the nuclear body .
Two proteins in the NB , Sp100 and PML , have previously been shown to be targets of autoantibodies .
In this study , serum from a patient with PBC was used to identify a novel NB antigen which was designated Sp140 .
The amino-terminal portion of Sp140 was 49 % identical to the amino-terminal region of Sp100 .
These portions of Sp100 and Sp140 contain potential coiled-coil motifs ( data not shown ) .

Pretreatment of rat anti-Sp140 antibodies with recombinant protein blocked the NB staining pattern ( panel C ) .
Two color immunohistochemical staining revealed co-localization of Sp140 and PML in the NBs of individual cells ( panel D ; note the halo of blue surrounding brown-staining NBs , as indicated by arrows ) .
In panels A and C , anti-Sp140 antibodies were revealed with TruBlue peroxidase substrate , resulting in a blue precipitate .
In panels B and D , mouse monoclonal anti-PML antibodies were detected using the DAB substrate , resulting in a brown precipitate .
In co-localization studies , Sp140 immunoreactivity was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated reagents and PhThalo Blue .
The cells in panels A , C , and D were counterstained lightly with hematoxylin to provide a pale blue contrast , while cells in panel B were counterstained with neutral red dye .
Rat anti-Sp140 antiserum reacted with NBs in RA-treated NBA4 cells ( panel E ; DAB brown chromagen ) .
Although the NB staining pattern was most evident in the indicated nucleus ( arrow ) , faint staining of NBs was present in all cells in this field .
Mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against PML also reacted with NBs in RA-treated NB4 cells ( panel !

Sp100 was a likely region for interactions between Sp100 and `` other PBC autoantigens . ``
A direct interaction between Sp100 and Sp140 has not yet been demonstrated .
The region in Sp140 between amino acids 579 and 619 contained a cysteine-rich , zinc-finger motif .
The presence of a zinc-finger domain in Sp1l40 suggests that the protein is a member of a larger family of proteins that have been implicated in the control of development , cellular differentiation , and cell growth .
The zinc-finger region may bind DNA directly or may interact with a second protein to form a dimer that binds DNA ( 46-48 ) .
The order of the cysteine/histidine residues in Sp140 ( C4HC3 ) differed slightly from that of the previously described RING finger ( C3HC4 ) and LIM motif ( C2HC5 ) .
Koken et al .
observed that the C4HC3 motif is present in a variety of proteins including Drosophila trithorax and its human homologue ALL-1 and proposed the name TTC ( for trithorax consensus ) for this family of proteins ( 49 ) .
The portion of Sp1l40 between amino acids 681 and 715 contained a bromodomain .
The bromodomain is a conserved sequence that is found in a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins ( 43-45 ) .
The predicted secondary structure of the bromodomain includes two strongly amphipathic « helices followed by reverse turns .
Although the functional significance of the bromodomain is unknown , the hydrophobic surfaces of the helices may serve as sites of intramolecular protein-protein interaction .
These interactions may influence the assembly or activity of multicomponent complexes involved in transcriptional activation ( 50 ) .
Expression of Sp140 in Human Tissues and Cell Lines-High levels of mRNA encoding Sp140 were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes and much lower levels were detected in all other tissues examined .
The predominant expression of Sp140 in human leukocytes suggests that Sp140 may have an important role in cellular functions that are unique to these cells .
Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in the myeloid precursor cell lines HL60 and NB4 .
Expression of Sp140 in HL6O cells was markedly increased during the course of differentiation of these cells toward either monocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes .
In addition , expression of Sp140 in NB4 cells was markedly increased following treat 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 29204 ment with RA , which induces a polymorphonuclear leukocyte morphology .
These results suggest that Sp140 may have a role in the differentiation of myeloid precursor cells .
The expression of Sp1l40 was not limited to leukocytes belonging to the monocyte/granulocyte lineage .
Sp140 mRNA was also detected in the T cell line Hut78 , but not in the T cell line Jurkat .
In addition , Sp140 mRNA was detected in the B cell line Raji , but not in B cell lines Ramos and HS-Sultan ( data not shown ) .
The significance of Sp140 expression in some , but not all , lymphocyte cell lines is not known .
Sp140 Is a Component of the NB-To investigate the cellular distribution of Sp140 , rat antiserum directed against a recombinant fragment of Sp140 was produced .
The antiserum reacted in immunoblot with Sp140 produced by in vitro transcription and translation .
In addition , the antiserum reacted in immunoblot with Sp140 in Me , SO-treated HL6O0 cells .
By immunohistochemical staining techniques , Sp140 co-localized with PML in MegSQO-treated HL60 cells .
These results demonstrate that Sp140 is a component of the NB .
Sp140 and Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia-In APL , a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 results in fusion of the NB protein PML to RAR- « .
Expression of the fusion protein disrupts the NB and inhibits normal myeloid maturation .
Treatment of APL cells with RA results in reformation of the NB and induces leukemic cell maturation ( 8 , 9-14 ) .
The mechanism of action of RA in these cells is unknown .
The myeloid precursor cell line NB4 contains the t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation associated with APL ( 28 ) .
Using immunohistochemistry , Sp140 was not detected in untreated NB4 cells ( Fig .
7G ) .
This was not surprising in view of the low level of Sp140 mRNA in these cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
However , following treatment of NB4 cells with RA , Sp140 was detected within the NBs of these cells ( Fig .
7 , panel E ) .
The observations that expression of Sp140 in NB4 cells is induced by RA treatment and that Sp140 associates with the NB suggest that Sp140 may have a role in the action of RA on APL cells .
The observed resistance of APL cells to RA that develops over time ( 51 , 52 ) may , in part , be a result of a second event in these cells that alters the structure or function of a protein ( possibly Sp140 ) that interacts with PML in the NB .
Sp140 and Viral Infection-IFN treatment increases the expression of each of the previously identified components of the NB ( Sp100 , PML , and NDP52 ) .
Guldner et al .
( 19 ) suggested that Sp100 may be involved in establishing an `` anti-viral state . ``
Recently , Doucas et al .
( 20 ) demonstrated that overex-pression of PML in HEp2 cells dramatically decreased the ability of these cells to support adenoviral replication .
The authors hypothesized that increased expression of PML may delay or block Sp100 and NDP52 recruitment to viral replication domains resulting in inhibition of viral DNA replication ( 20 ) .
The identification of a novel NB component that is expressed in cells involved in host defense raises the possibility that Sp140 may also have a role in the pathogenesis of , or the host response to , viral infection .
In summary , a novel component of the NB has been identified and characterized .
The predicted amino acid sequence of Sp140 suggests that this protein is involved in the regulation of gene transcription .
The predominant expression of Sp1l40 in leukocytes raises the possibility that this protein has an important role in cellular functions that are unique to these cells .
Future studies of Sp140 may provide insight into the function of the NB and the role of this organelle in myeloproliferative disease , viral infection and autoimmune disorders .
