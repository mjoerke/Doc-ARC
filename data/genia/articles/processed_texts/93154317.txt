Schaffner The Epstein-Barr virus protein EBNAZ acts as a transcriptional activator of cellular and viral genes and plays a crucial role in the immortalization of human primary B-cells by EBV .
We have shown previously that EBNA2 transactivates the promoters of the latent membrane antigens LMP , TP1 and TP2 .
The promoter of the TP !
gene was chosen as a model system to study the molecular mechanism of EBNA2 mediated transactivation .
To identify an EBNA2 dependent cis-acting element , various TPZ promoter-reporter gene constructs were transfected in the absence and presence of an EBNA2Z expression vector into the established B-cell line BL41-P3HR1 .
We were able to delineate an 81 bp EBNA2 responsive region between -258 and -177 relative to the TPZ RNA start site .
The element worked in either orientation and could mediate EBNA2 dependent transactivation on a heterologous promoter .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed three specific protein-DNA complexes formed with sequences of the EBNA2 responsive element .
Two of these were not cell type specific , but the third was detected only in EBNA2 positive cell extracts .
Gel-shift analysis in the presence of EBNA2 specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that EBNA2 is a component of the third complex .
Thus , these experiments demonstrate that EBNA2 interacts with an EBNA2 responsive cis-element of the TP !
promoter .
Key words : DNA-protein interaction/EBNA2/Epstein-Barr virus/terminal protein 1/transactivation Introduction Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , a widespread human herpesvirus , is the aetiological agent of infectious mononucleosis , a self-limiting lymphoproliferative disease .
The virus is associated with two human malignancies , namely Burkitt 's lymphoma ( a B-cell neoplasia ) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma , which is composed of poorly differentiated epithelial cells .
EBV has a dual tropism : it infects primary resting B-cells and epithelial cells .
Virus production occurs only in epithelial cells , whereas B-cells are latently infected .
In vitro infection of resting B-lymphocytes leads to the outgrowth of permanently virus © Oxford University Press transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines .
In these immortalized cell lines the virus is maintained as an episomal molecule at high copy number ( Lindahl et al .
, 1976 ) and only a few viral genes are expressed .
These genes code for six nuclear antigens , EBNA1I , 2 , 3a , 3b , 3¢c and -LP , and three membrane proteins , the latent membrane protein ( LMP ) and terminal proteins ( TPs ) 1 and 2 , also denoted by LMP2A and B ( for review see Kieff and Liebowitz , 1990 ) .
These gene products seem to be important for induction and maintenance of B-cell immortalization .
However , the individual functions of these gene products in latent infection and growth transformation are only poorly understood .
EBNAZ , one of the best studied latent gene products , is absolutely necessary for B-cell immortalization .
One viral mutant ( P3HR1 ) carrying a 6.6 kb deletion ( Bornkamm et al .
, 1982 ; Jeang and Hayward , 1983 ) that removes EBNAZ and part of EBNA-LP , has lost the ability to transform primary B-cells .
Reintroduction of EBNA2 into the P3HR1 virus by homologous recombination reconstituted the full transforming capacity ( Cohen et al .
, 1989 ; Hammerschmidt and Sudgen , 1989 ) .
In natural EBV isolates , two alleles of the EBNAZ gene exist coding for two proteins ( EBNAZA and EBNA2B ) with 57 % homology ( Dambaugh et al .
, 1984 ; Adldinger et al .
, 1985 ; Zimber et al .
, 1986 ) .
There have been some reports that EBV strains carrying EBNA2A could transform primary B-cells more efficiently than those containing an EBNA2B allele ( Rickinson et al .
, 1987 ; Cohen ert al .
, 1989 ) .
The EBNA2 gene codes for a 487 amino acid phoshorylated polypeptide ( Grisser et al .
, 1991 ) .
Characteristic features of the primary structure of the protein include a proline stretch of ~40 amino acids near the N-terminus , a negatively charged C-terminus and a glycine/arginine-rich region .
It has recently been shown that EBNAZ acts as a transcriptional activator : it stimulates the transcription of the cellular genes CD2 ] , CD23 and c-fgr ( Calender et al .
, 1987 ; Wang et al .
, 1987 ; Abbot et al .
, 1990 ; Cordier et al .
, 1990 ; Knutson , 1990 ) as well as the expression of the viral genes LMP , TP ] and TP2 ( Fahraeus et al .
, 1990 ; Ghosh and Kieff , 1990 ; Zimber-Strobl et al .
, 1991 ) .
Although a transactivation domain has been mapped in the C-terminus of EBNA2 ( Cohen and Kieff , 1991 ) , it is not yet known whether EBNA2 transactivates several genes by interacting with EBNAZ responsive cis-elements or whether it does so by modulating the expression or modification of transcription factors .
A consensus sequence in the promoter region of the EBNA2 ?
-regulated genes has not been described until now .
To elucidate the mechanism of EBNAZ2 mediated transactivation , we focused our interest on the TP ] promoter region .
The 7P gene is transcribed across the terminal repeats of the EBV genome ( Laux et al .
, 1988 ; Sample et al .
, 1989 ) .
A functional transcription unit can only be created if the linear molecule is circularized .
The TATA-box of the TP ] promoter is located at the right hand end of the linear viral 167 U.Zimber-Strobl et al .

In this report we describe an element that mediates transactivation by EBNA2 to the TPZ promoter .

81 bp ( -177 to -258 ) of the TPZ promoter are sufficient to mediate transactivation by EBNA2 .
( A ) Results of CAT assays of transfections of CAT constructs containing the EBNA2 responsive region ( pTP1-CAT/135bp and pTP1-CAT/81bp ) in front of the TPZ minimal promoter ( pTP1-CAT/-45 ) without EBNA2Z ( - ) , with pU294-6 coding for wild-type EBNA2 ( WT ) and with p604 coding for mutated EBNA2 ( Mut ) into BL41-P3HR 1 cells .
The element was cloned in the correct ( 135bp/1 , $ 1bp/1l ) and inverse ( 135bp/2 , 81bp/2 ) orientations .
( B ) CAT assays after transfections of CAT constructs containing the 7P7 promoter region from position -124 to -258 in front of the 3-globin minimal promoter into BL41-P3HR1 cells without EBNA2 ( - ) and with the EBNAZ expression vector pU294-6 ( + ) .
The element is cloned in either orientation correct ; B135bp/2 , inverse ) .
truncations of the 5 ' region of the TPZ promoter linked to the reporter genes chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) or luciferase ( LUC ) were constructed ( Figure 1A ) to identify an EBNA2Z responsive cis-element within this promoter .
These constructs were transiently transfected into the EBNA2 negative BL41-P3HR 1 cell line and into EBNA2 positive BL41-B95-8 cells A cytomegalovirus enhancer-long terminal repeat-CAT construct ( CMV-LTR-CAT ) was used as a positive control .
Transfections of the TP ] promoter -CAT constructs into BL41-P3HR 1 cells resulted in very low or undetectable CAT activities ( Figure 1B ) .
Transfections of constructs containing -45 , -124 and -177 bp upstream of the TP ] cap site into BL41-B95-8 cells resulted in low CAT activities similar to those obtained with transfections into BL41-P3HR1 cells .
However , CAT activities significantly increased after transfections of CAT constructs containing sequences upstream of position -177 relative to the TPZ cap site ( Figure 1B ) .
These results suggested that an EBNA2 responsive region is located between -177 and -258 .
We performed cotransfection experiments in order to prove that the increased TPZ promoter activity in BL41-B95-8 cells is mediated by EBNA2Z .
TPZ promoter deletion constructs driving the reporter gene luciferase were transfected into BL41-P3HR 1 cells either without EBNA2 or with an EBNA2ZA ( pU294-6 ) expression vector or with EBNAZA expression vectors carrying mutations within the EBNA2 open reading frame ( ORF ) .
The EBNA2 mutation p604 contains a linker insertion after one-third of the EBNA2 ORF , leading to a truncated EBNA2 gene product .
In the EBNA2 mutation pU812/9 , amino acids 248-382 of EBNA2 are deleted .
The EBNA2 gene and its mutants are under the control of the natural promoter of EBNA2 .
The obtained relative light units ( RLU ) of the LUC assays confirmed the CAT data described above ( Figure 1C ) .
Only LUC constructs containing at least 258 bp of the TPZ 5 flanking region were inducible by EBNA2 ( by factors of 25-71 ) , whereas the three smallest constructs were unresponsive to EBNA2Z .
In order to demonstrate that a specific EBNA2 responsive element has been identified , we removed the TP ] promoter region between positions -258 and -147 in the TPZ promoter reporter gene construct pTP1-LUC/-543 , leaving the boundaries of the TPZ promoter intact .
This construct was transfected into BL41-P3HR 1 cells together with the EBNA2 expression vectors mentioned above .
As shown in Figure 1C , induction of LUC activities by EBNA2 could not be observed after transfection of the TP ] promoter LUC construct lacking the TPZ promoter region between -258 and -147 .
This was confirmed by transfection of the same construct with the CAT reporter gene ( data not shown ) .
These data show that sequences between -258 and -147 are required for EBNA2 mediated transactivation .
The EBNAZ responsive element is orientation independent and active on a heterologous promoter The putative element was cloned in front of the 7P7 minimal promoter ( +60/-45 ) and the CAT reporter gene to study whether the EBNA2 responsive region is active even when separated from its cognate 7P 7 promoter region .
Two DNA constructs were made carrying a larger ( - 124 to -258 ) and a smaller fragment ( -177 to -258 ) in both orientations .
In these constructs the suggested EBNAZ responsive element is surrounded by vector sequences .
The distance of the element from the TP ] TATA box is comparable to the native situation .
All DNA constructs were transfected in the absence and presence of EBNAZ expression vectors into BL41-P3HR 1 cells .
pU294-6 and p604 , coding for wild-type EBNAZ and truncated EBNA2 , respectively , were used as EBNA2 expression vectors .

Analysis of DNA-protein interactions within the 7P/ promoter .
Autoradiogram of an EMSA is shown made with nuclear extracts of BL41-P3HR1 cells which were incubated with a 32P-labelled fragment spanning the TPZ promoter region from position -12 to -258 relative to the TP7 transcription start .
Competition studies were performed with oligonucleotides covering the EBNA2Z responsive region identified in the CAT and LUC analyses .
The positions of the oligonucleotides in the EBV genome are described in Materials and methods .
Unlabelled oligonucleotides were added to the gel-shift reaction in a 100-fold molar excess .
resulted in a significant higher CAT activity in the presence of the EBNAZ expression vector pU294-6 , regardless of the orientation of the element relative to the promoter ( Figure 2A ) .
To determine whether the EBNAZ responsive region contains sequences that can regulate a heterologous promoter , we cloned the 7P/ promoter region from positions - 124 to -258 upstream of the 3-globin minimal promoter ( Westin et al .
, 1987 ) .
Cotransfections of the EBNA2 expression vector pU294-6 resulted in significantly increased CAT activities in the presence of reporter plasmids carrying the EBNA2Z responsive region ( Figure 2B ) .
In this assay , the element conferred EBNA2 inducibility in an orientation independent fashion as has been demonstrated by the TP ] promoter constructs .
From these data we conclude that an 81 bp region within the 7P1 promoter harbours an EBNA2Z responsive cis-element , which we will call EBNAZRE .
EBNAZRE is active in both orientations and able to regulate a heterologous promoter .
Specific DNA-protein interactions within the EBNAZ responsive region Gel-retardation assays were performed to identify specific DNA-protein interactions within the 7P7 promoter .
A DNA fragment spanning the TP ] promoter from position -12 to -258 was end-labelled and incubated with nuclear extracts of BL41-P3HR1 cells .
The result of the electrophoretic mobility shift ( EMSA ) is shown in Figure 3 .
EMSA revealed one prominent DNA-protein interaction ( complex I ) and two weaker complexes ( II and IID ) .
To investigate whether some of these complexes are formed with sequences located in the EBNA2 responsive region ( -258 170 Fig .

Complexes I and III could be competed with O1 and O2 covering sequences between -262 and -209 .
None of the complexes could be competed by the adjacent oligonucleotides O3 and O4 .
In order to study the interaction of 7PZ promoter sequences from position -262 to -209 with cellular proteins in more detail , the 54 bp fragment was end-labelled and incubated with nuclear extracts of several cell lines ( HL60 , HeLa , BL41 , BL41-P3HR1 , HH514 , Jijoye , M-ABA and Raji ) ( Figures 4 and 5A ) .
Similar complexes were formed with the 54 bp fragment as with the 247 bp fragment used in the EMSA described above .
Again one prominent ( I ) and two weaker complexes ( II and III ) could be detected .
Complexes I-III were formed in all cell extracts tested and therefore seem to be cell-type unspecific .
Notably , additional complexes ( IVA and IVB ) could be detected with extracts of the EBNA2 positive cell lines Jijoye , M-ABA and Raji , which were not found with extracts of EBNA2 negative cell lines .
The specificity of the DNA-protein interactions was analysed in competition experiments following addition of the unlabelled 54 bp oligonucleotide to EMSAs with Raji , HH514 , Jijoye and M-ABA extracts ( Figure 5A and B ) .
Only complex II could not be competed and appears to be unspecific .
Additionally , we tested the ability of O1 and O2 to prevent formation of protein-DNA complexes formed with the 54 bp oligonucleotide and nuclear proteins of Raji cells .
All specific complexes could be competed by O1 and O2 with the same efficiency as by O54bp ( Figure 5A ) .

The resulting products were separated on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel .

The indicated positions correspond to the TP7 transcription start site .
An 11 bp motif duplicated in O054bp is marked by dotted boxes , the 10 bp overlapping region of O1 and O2 by hatched boxes .
two oligonucleotides share a 10 bp overlapping region and a common motif of 11 bp ( Figure 5C ) .
To test whether the 11 bp motif was involved in the protein-DNA interaction , these sequences were truncated ( oligo 11mut , Figure 5C ) .
As shown in Figure 5A , the truncated oligonucleotide has completely lost the ability to prevent formation of the DNA-protein complexes .
This suggests that the 11 bp motif is important for protein-DNA interaction within the EBNA2 responsive region .
EBNAZ is present in DNA-protein complexes formed with the EBNAZ responsive region Differences between EBNAZ positive and negative cell lines detected in the EMSAs described above were low mobility complexes IVA and IVB .
To test whether EBNA2 was present in any of the complexes described above , DNA binding assays were performed with HH514 , Jijoye and M-ABA extracts ( EBNAZ negative , EBNA2B positive and EBNAZA positive , respectively ) in the presence and absence of monoclonal antibodies raised against EBNAZA .
The monoclonal antibody EBNA2Z-R 1 is able to detect EBNA2ZA as well as EBNA2B , whereas anti-EBNA2Z-R2 recognizes EBNAZA but has only a very low affinity for EBNA2B in immunoprecipitation ( Kremmer et al .
, in preparation ) .
Two nonspecific antibodies , raised against murine CD45 , of the same isotype as the anti-EBNA2Z-R1 and anti-EBNA2-R2 antibodies were used as a control .
The presence of the anti-EBNAZ-R1 antibody resulted in a supershift of complex IVB in Jijoye and complex IVA in M-ABA extracts ( Figure 6A ) .
By contrast , anti-EBNA2Z-R2 , which recognizes EBNAZA with a high affinity but EBNA2B with a very low affinity , led to a supershift of complex IVA but not of complex IVB .
Both control antibodies had no effect on the mobility of complexes IVA and IVB .
We have repeated the experiments with two further EBNAZ2 monoclonals , anti-EBNA2Z-R3 and anti-EBNA2-R11 .
Both antibodies recognized EBNAZA , whereas EBNA2ZB was recognized only by EBNA2Z-R3 .
We got the same results as with the antibodies described above .
Both antibodies caused a supershift of complex IVa , but only anti-EBNA2-R3 was able to supershift complex IVb ( data not shown ) .
These results imply that complex IVA contains EBNA2ZA and complex IVB EBNA2ZB .

were affected by the monoclonal EBNA2Z antibodies , suggesting that they do not contain EBNA2 .
We confirmed that EBNA2 is really a component of the protein-DNA complex IV by studying the ability of in vitro synthesized EBNAZ to form this complex .
The EBNA2 ORF was translated in a reticulocyte lysate .
The in vitro synthesized EBNA2 was added to the EBNA2Z negative BLA41-P3HR1 extracts and EMSAs were performed .
As shown in Figure 6B the in vitro translated EBNA2 formed a more slowly migrating complex .
In contrast , addition of a control reticulocyte lysate containing in vitro translated brome mosaic virus ( BMV ) RNA did not induce this complex .
That the complex induced by in vitro translated EBNAZ did contain the added EBNA2Z was confirmed by assaying the effect of monoclonal antibodies .
Anti-EBNAZ-R3 but not the control antibody ( anti-CD45 ) induced a supershift of the newly formed complex .
An additional complex ( * ) appeared in the presence of nuclear extracts , EBNA2 and monoclonal anti-EBNA2 antibodies in this experiment .
This complex was not always reproducible and is therefore not further considered .
Besides the in vitro translated EBNA2 diminished formation of complexes I and III .
Whether this effect is specific or not is still unclear .
The in vitro translated EBNA2 was not able to bind DNA in the absence of nuclear extracts , suggesting that EBNAZ interacts with DNA not directly but indirectly .
172 Discussion It is assumed that the contribution of EBNA2Z to B-cell immortalization is conferred by its ability to transactivate viral and cellular genes .
In order to understand the process of immortalization at a molecular level , it is essential to elucidate the mechanism of EBNA2 mediated transactivation .
We chose the TPZ promoter as a model system for studying EBNA2 dependent transcription .
As shown previously , 7P7 transcription was dependent on the presence of EBNAZ in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells ( Zimber-Strobl et al .
, 1991 ) .
Our first aim was to identify a cis-acting element mediating EBNA2 responsiveness .
Therefore we transfected different TPZ promoter-reporter gene constructs in the presence and absence of EBNAZ .
By this approach we were able to identify an 81 bp element between positions -177 and -258 which is sufficient to confer EBNA2 responsiveness .
The EBNAZ responsive element ( EBNA2ZRE ) works in either orientation and is able to regulate a heterologous promoter .
These results imply that EBNA2 responsiveness is conferred by an enhancer-like cis-element .
This observation is in agreement with previous reports .
EBNA2 responsive elements were also identified within the LMP , BamHI-C and CD23 promoters and it has been reported that they work in an orientation independent fashion and regulate a heterologous promoter ( Sung et al .
, 1991 ; Tsang et al .
, 1991 ; Wang ert al .
, 1991 ; Woisetschlaeger et al .
, 1991 ) .
We performed EMSAs to identify specific protein-DNA interactions within the 7P/ promoter .
One prominent DNA-protein complex ( I ) and two weaker complexes ( II and III ) were detected with a radioactively labelled fragment spanning the 7P/ promoter from position -12 to -258 ( 5'-end of the EBNAZRE ) .
It was possible to compete specifically complexes I and III with two oligonucleotides spanning the region -262 to -230 and -239 to -209 .
When extracts were mixed with a radioactive oligonucleotide from position -262 to -209 and EMSAs were performed , the same pattern of complex formation occurred .
These experiments indicate that protein ( s ) interact with sequences located in the EBNA2ZRE .
Formation of complexes I , II and III appeared to be independent of EBNAZ and even independent of the cellular background of B-cells , since they were detected in all cell lines studied .
This implies binding of a universal transcription factor .
We were not able to identify this factor by comparing the sequence with known consensus sequences of transcription factors ( Ghosh , 1990 ) .
The only obvious cognate nuclear factor binding sequence in the 54 bp fragment is one SP1 consensus sequence at position -240 .
Addition of a 500-fold excess of an unlabelled oligonucleotide representing the SP1 binding site failed to compete the shift ( data not shown ) .
It is therefore unlikely that this SP1 site plays an essential role in the observed DNA-protein interaction .
Formation of all complexes except complex II was competed by an excess of unlabelled O1 as well as O2 .
These two oligonucleotides share a 10 bp overlapping region and a common motif of 11 bp .
The 11 bp motif seems to play an essential role in DNA-protein interactions , since an oligonucleotide containing the complete 10 bp overlap , but two truncated 11 bp motifs , has lost the ability to inhibit the protein binding of the 54 bp oligonucleotide .
Realizing the importance of the 11 bp motif we searched for this sequence in the EBNA2 responsive regions of the BamHI-C and LMP promoters which were shown to be activated by EBNAZ .
Sung et al .
( 1991 ) reported an EBNA2 responsive region of 98 bp within the BamHI-C promoter between positions -367 and -465 .
In the LMP promoter , Tsang ert al .
( 1991 ) described an element of 30 bp between positions -234 and -205 which is essential although not sufficient for EBNA2 responsiveness .
Remarkably , the BamHI-C promoter contains , at position -371 , a 10 bp sequence that is identical to the 11 bp motif , and the LMP promoter contains , at position -218 , a sequence that shares 7 bp ( GTGGGAA ) of the 11 bp motif .
Recently it was shown by footprint analyses that parts of the 10 bp motif of the BamHI-C promoter interact with a DNA binding protein ( Jin and Speck , 1992 ) .
Taking this into account , it seems likely that the 11 bp motif plays an essential role in EBNA2 mediated transactivation .
Is EBNA2 a component of the DNA-protein complexes ?
As mentioned above , EBNA2 positive and negative cell extracts showed almost identical binding patterns in EMSA .
Only a very slowly migrating band ( IVA or IVB ) could be detected in Raji , M-ABA and Jijoye extracts , which was missing in all EBNAZ negative cell extracts .
We mixed EBNAZ specific monoclonal antibodies in the EMSA to EBNA2 interaction with TP1 promoter study whether one of the retarded bands contained EBNA2 .
Addition of EBNA2Z antibodies resulted in a supershift of complexes IVA and IVB .
An antibody recognizing only EBNAZA induced a supershift of complex IVA only , whereas an antibody specific for EBNA2ZA and EBNA2B retarded migration of both complexes IVA and IVB .
This indicates that EBNA2B is a component of complex IVB and EBNAZA a component of complex IVA .
To prove that EBNA2 is indeed a component of complex IV , we added in vitro translated EBNAZ to EBNA2 negative BL41-P3HR 1 extracts and performed EMSAs .
The in vitro translated EBNA2 induced the formation of a more slowly migrating complex .
By adding monoclonal antibodies we showed that the EBNA2-induced complex contained the added EBNA2 .
The complex containing the in vitro translated EBNA2 migrated slightly faster than complex IVa visible in M-ABA extracts .
This phenomenon could be caused by different modifications of the in vivo and in vitro synthesized EBNA2 .
Although the 54 bp fragment is sufficient to bind EBNA2 , it is not able to mediate EBNA2Z responsiveness ( data not shown ) , suggesting that sequences between -209 and -177 are necessary for EBNA2 dependent transactivation .
It is conceivable that an additional protein binds to these sequences and contributes to EBNA2 responsiveness .
Here we have shown for the first time that EBNA2Z is present in complexes of specific DNA sequences and protein ( s ) .
Our experiments suggest that EBNAZ interacts with DNA indirectly via protein-protein interactions .
Such interactions have been shown to be responsible for transactivation by E1A and VP16 ( Lillie and Green , 1989 ; Stern et al .
, 1989 ; Liu and Green , 1990 ) transactivators of adenovirus and herpes simplex virus , respectively .
VP16 binds to the universal transcription factor Oct1 , juxtaposing the transactivation domain of VP16 to the promoter .
It seems likely that EBNAZ also interacts with a transcription factor , perhaps contained in complexI and/or III .
We are in the process of identifying the factors interacting with the EBNAZRE of the TPZ promoter , which should further elucidate EBNA2 mediated transactivation .

The plasmid used in the in vitro translation of EBNA2 was constructed by inserting the genomic B95-8 EBV sequence from position 48 039 to 54 360 in a Bluescript vector digested with HindIII and BamHI .
Just in front of the translation start of EBNA2 , an EcoRI site was inserted by site directed mutagenesis ( pBSmutC ) .
pBSmutC was cut with HindIII and EcoRI and an oligonucleotide representing a ribosome binding site was inserted ( pGa206/6 ) .

Transfection of the cells Electroporation of cells was carried out by the method of Cann et a/ .
( 1988 ) .
Briefly , 10 `` cells were washed once and resuspended in 0.25 ml fresh ice-cold RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
The cells were placed on ice in a Gene Pulser cuvette , and 20 ug of the corresponding DNA was added .
Cells were electroporated with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 250 V and 960 uF .
At 10 min after electroporation , cells were resuspended in 10 ml of prewarmed RPMI with 20 % fetal calf serum .
