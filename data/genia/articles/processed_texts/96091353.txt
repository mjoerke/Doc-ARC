We have previously found that the normal developmental patterns of globin gene expression are recapitulated in an experimental system of primary cultures that support differentiation of erythroid progenitors .
We further found that high activities of the transcriptional activators , GATA-I and SPI , are associated with normal adult erythroid differentiation .
Materials and Methods : In the present work , we have studied the activities of GATA-1 and SP1 during differentiation of cultured erythroid progenitors derived from cord blood and from fetal livers , as well as from B°-thalassemia patients .
Results : The results showed high GATA-1 binding ac tivity and very low SP1 activity in the fetal liver cultures .
This pattem was in contrast to cultures derived from normal adult peripheral blood , in which both GATA-1 and SPI activities were high .
Cord blood cultures showed an additive combination of `` adult `` and `` fetal `` patterns .
The progenitors derived from a B°-thalassemia patient with high HbF production showed `` fetal `` pattern .
On the other hand , in cultures of 2 B°-thalassemia patients without high HbF , `` adult `` pattem was ob-served .
Conclusions : In the present work , we show that human fetal and adult erythroid progenitors are distinct in their transcription factors , and that the commitment to fetal or adult program occurs at a very early differentiation stage .
Our studies also demonstrate that under anemic stress , recruitment of fetal progenitors may occur in adulthood .

In some individuals this occurs due to y-globin promoter mutations or to deletions in the B-globin gene cluster .
In others , the mechanism is not understood .
In spite of intensive research , this mechanism has not been clarified , partly because of the unavailability of an adequate animal model , since the switch mechanism varies among different mammals .
It has been suggested that normal adult erythroid cells go through a `` fetal `` stage during differentiation before maturing into cells producing adult hemoglobin ( « 2B2 ) ( 1 ) .
The 297 298 Molecular Medicine , Volume 1 , Number 3 , March 1995 clonal model , on the other hand , invokes distinct progenitors and separate pathways ( 2 ) .
Our previous studies demonstrated that adult and neonatal patterns of globin gene expression are recapitulated in liquid cultures that support proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors ( 3 ) .
The cultures are grown in two phases : first the early progenitors , burst forming units , erythroid , ( BFUe ) , proliferate and differentiate into colony forming units , erythroid ( CFUe ) .
Further differentiation and maturation , including globin gene expression and hemoglobin biosynthesis , is erythropoietin ( EPO ) dependent ( 4 ) .
In our experiments ( 3 ) , cultured adult progenitors , from peripheral blood , gave rise primarily to the B- and a-globin expressing cells , while progenitors of neonate cord blood ( CBL ) differentiated into cells that also synthesized high levels of y-globin mRNA .
Those experiments suggested that the fetal progenitors are distinct from adult progenitors and that CBL contains a mixed population of both .
The peak of y-globin gene expression usually preceded that of B , implying that fetal progenitors tend to differentiate faster than the adult ones .
We further found that the appearance of globin mRNA in adult cultures was preceded by a burst in the level of GATA-1 , which was triggered by the addition of EPO ( 5 ) .
GATA-1 is a major transcriptional activator of erythroid differentiation ( 6,7 ) , regulating a number of erythroid specific genes , including globin ( 8 ) .
We observed a parallel rise in the level of the ubiquitous factor , SPI , indicating that not only GATA-1 , but also SP1 participates in adult erythroid maturation .
Additional evidence for the role of SP1 in human erythroid differentiation comes from other studies .
Analysis of binding of transcriptional factors at the B-globin locus control region ( LCR ) suggested that the combination of SP1 and GATA-1 plays a role in the high levels of globin gene expression ( 9 ) .
It was also found that GATA-1 and SPI interact at the y-globin promoter .
Depending on their concentrations , this interaction led to synergistic transcriptional activation or to interference ( 10 ) .
Furthermore , it has been reported that the levels of GATA-1 and SP1 play an important role in the mechanism of globin switching in the chicken ( 11 ) .
Primary cells of the primitive erythroid lineage were found to contain 10-fold more of these two factors than did cells of the definitive erythroid lineage .
In the present work , we analyzed the activities of GATA-1 and SP1 in primary cultures de- rived from CBL , mid-gestation fetal livers , and adult B-thalassemia patients with high and low HbF production .
Our results indicate that fetal and adult erythroid differentiation occurs along separate pathways .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Erythroid Cultures CBL samples were obtained from the Hadassah maternity ward .
Liver tissues were derived from fetuses aborted at 20 weeks gestational age ( be-cause of a nonglobin genetic defect ) , obtained from the Department of Pathology , Hebrew University ( Jerusalem , Israel ) .
Peripheral blood samples of B-thalassemia patients were withdrawn prior to transfusions .
All samples were obtained according to the Helsinki Committee guidelines .
The liver tissues were finely minced and dispersed by pipetting .
The cultures were grown in two phases as previously described ( 3,4 ) .
The dispersed liver cells , or buffy coats of the blood samples , were cultured in the presence of conditioned medium from human bladder carcinoma cells for 7 days ( from Day -7 to Day 0 ) .
The cells were then washed and recultured in medium supplemented with 1 U/ml recombinant EPO .
Microscopic slides were prepared by cytospin , following lysis of the enucleated red blood cells with H,0 , and stained with May-Grunwald Giemsa .
Hemoglobinized cells were identified by the benzidine peroxidase reaction ( 12 ) .
RNA Analyses RNA was purified from cytoplasmic miniextracts , prepared in parallel to nuclear extracts ( 13,14 ) from a total of 2 X 10° cells .
Reverse transcription ( RT ) was performed with oligo ( dT ) .
The primers for PCR were the following : for y-globin , the 5 ' primer was ACAAGGCTACTAT CACAAGCCT ( exon 1 ) , and the 3 ' primer was CTITATGGCATCTCCCAAGGAA ( exon 2 ) ; for fB-globin , the 5 primer was CACCTITGCCA CACTGAGTGA ( exon 2 ) , and the 3 ' primer CCA GATGCTCAAGGCCCTTC ( from the untranslated region 3 ' to exon 3 ) .
The amplification cycle was 92°C for 1 min , 60°C for 1 min , and 72°C for 1 min , repeated for 30 cycles .
The reaction products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining following electrophoresis on 8 % native acrylamide gels .

: Transcription Factors in Hemoglobin Switching 299 analysis were GCCCATCTCTACCAAGGCCT and AGAAGGACACCACCCCTCCT , derived from the 3 ' end of the human GATA-1 mRNA , producing a 204 bp amplification product ( 5 ) .
The PCR primers for GATA-2 analysis were CCCTAAG CAGCGCAGCAAGAC and GATGAGTGGTCGG TTCTGGCC ( 15 ) .
The amplification cycle for both GATA-1 and GATA-2 was 92°C for 1 min , 62°C for 1 min , and 72°C for 1 min , repeated for 30 cycles .
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Gel Retardation Assays Nuclear miniextracts ( 13 ) were prepared from a total of 2 X 10° cells for each time-point .
Binding activities of GATA-1 and SP1 were assayed by the gel retardation assay as previously described ( 5 ) .
Oligonucleotides for the gel retardation assay were the following : for GATA-1 , CGGGCAACT GATAAGGATTCCCA , derived from the promoter region of the mouse a-1 globin gene ( 16 ) ; and for SPI , CTTGGGGGCCCCTCCCCCACACTATCTCAAT , derived from the human y-globin gene ( this oligonucleotide contains a T to C transition at position -198 , creating a strong SP1 binding site ) ( 17 ) .
The specific 5 end-labeled oligonucleotides were annealed with an excess of the complementary oligonucleotide and repurified by poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis .
Binding reactions were performed on equal amounts of nuclear proteins obtained from 1.2 X 10° cells .
Competition experiments were performed by adding 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide .
The DNA-protein complexes were then separated on 5 % native polyacryl-amide gels .
Intensities of the shifted bands were determined by phospho-imaging of the gels using the Bio-Imaging Analyzer , BAS1000 , FUJIX .
RESULTS GATA-1 and SPI Activities in Erythroid Progenitors Derived from CBL To gain an insight into the mechanism of hemoglobin switching , we examined the factors GATA-1 and SPI in differentiating progenitors derived from CBL .
Samples of CBL were grown in the two-phase liquid culture system ( 4 ) .
In the first phase , mononuclear cells were cultured with conditioned medium containing hemapoi-etic growth factors not including EPO .
EPO was added at the beginning of the second phase .
Samples were taken at different time points , and nuclear extracts were prepared .
We found that , similar to the adult cultures , high levels of GATA-1 binding activity were present on Days 7-12 ( Fig .
la and b ) .
However , while the level of SPI in the adult cultures rose in parallel to that of GATA-1 ( 5 ) ( see also Fig .
3d ) , in the CBL culture SP1 was very low on Days 7 and 9 , and increased substantially , to adult level , only on Day 12 .
These observations are consistent with the notion that CBL contains a mixture of adult and fetal progenitors .
We concluded that the high GATA-1 and SPI ( seen on Day 12 ) characterize the adult progenitors present in the culture , which appear to differentiate more slowly than the fetal progenitors .
We attributed the high GATA-1/low SPI activities seen on Days 7-9 to the differentiating fetal cells .
Therefore , the results implied that the fetal erythroid differentiation program is associated with high GATA-1 activity and low SPI .
Differentiation of Fetal Liver Progenitors in Liquid Culture To obtain more direct evidence we proceeded to investigate differentiating erythroid cultures derived from midgestation human fetal livers , as a source of pure fetal progenitors .
Livers were obtained from aborted fetuses ( Week 19-20 gestational age ) and single-cell suspensions were prepared .
Those included a large proportion of nucleated , hemoglobinized erythroid cells ( orthochromatic normoblasts ) .
The cells were plated with conditioned medium ( Day -7 ) .
Three days later ( Day -4 ) a small number of nonhemoglobinized erythroid cells ( pronormo-blasts and basophilic normoblasts ) appeared .
Those were presumably cells that were beyond the CFUe stage , and already EPO-induced , when placed in culture .
During the first phase , the number of the nucleated erythroid cells decreased dramatically , due to enuclation of the orthochromatic normoblasts and cell death .
The early erythroblasts , which were visible on Day -4 , did not give rise to hemoglobinized cells , since they probably died in the absence of EPO .
After EPO addition ( Day 0 ) significant erythroid proliferation and differentiation ensued .
The differentiation of a representative culture after EPO addition is shown in Fig .
2a .
Globin mRNA was analyzed by the RT-PCR procedure .
As seen in Fig .
2b , cells from the first phase contained both B- and y-mRNA ( Days -4 300 Molecular Medicine , Volume 1 , Number 3 , March 1995 a GATA-1 SP1 r 71 Day K562 7 9 12 9 K562 7 9 12 9° 5 s f- r -- 3 Competition mo pos - 8 po- po- - - o j-SP1 GATA-1 ~-b 5 leat = 41 » / ‘ \ hel v / ( C y & ‘ 3 C0 `` G fast mm 27 O-A Ao go-6 - 7 8 - 9 10 11 12 13 D a y FIG .

and 0 ) , suggesting that they included both fetal-type and adult-type cells .
The adult-type cells in the fetal liver were presumably derived from the circulating fetal blood .
At this gestational age , approximately 10 % of the hemoglobin in the fetal blood is adult hemoglobin ( normal B/y-chain synthesis ratio is ~10 % [ 18 ] ) .
In the second phase , the cells contained only y-globin mRNA ( Fig .
2¢ , Days 5 and 8 ) , indicating that those cells were derived from pure fetal progenitors .
The 343 bp band corresponds to the un-spliced y-RNA ( or DNA ) .
Analyses of GATA-1 and SP1 Activities in the Fetal Liver Cultures Nuclear proteins were extracted and assayed for the levels of GATA-1 and SP1 by the gel retardation assay using end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either binding site .
The results obtained from the fetal liver culture shown in Fig .
2 are presented in Fig .
3a and b , and summarized graphically in Fig .
3¢ .
Two additional fetal liver cultures gave similar results ( not shown ) .
EPO was added on Day 0 .
This was followed by an increase in the level of GATA-1 , with a peak on Day 6 , while the level of SPI remained low throughout the culture period , in contrast to adult cultures , in which SPI activity was significantly higher and its kinetics paralleled that of GATA-1 ( compare Fig .
3¢ and d ) .
For comparison , binding activity of GATA-1 and SP1 of a normal adult-derived culture grown , harvested and analyzed in parallel to the fetal liver culture is shown in Lanes 14-15 ( Days 5 and 7 ) in Fig .
3a and b .
In the fetal liver cells harvested on Day -7 , when the culture first started , the levels of both transcription factors were high , consistent with the presence of adult-type B-globin expressing cells .
The levels of both transcription factors decreased as those ( presum-ably BM-derived ) cells matured .
Before replating the cells in the second phase ( Day 0 ) , the culture was divided , and part was grown without EPO .
Neither GATA-1 nor SPI activities were detected in the absence of EPO throughout the culture period ( Lanes 16-19 , Fig .
3a and b ) .
Those nuclear extracts were positive for the ubiquitous transcription factor OTF-1 ( data not shown ) , which served as an internal control for nuclear protein extraction .
These results corroborate that GATA-1 binding activity is EPO dependent .
The experiments demonstrate that high SPI activity is not involved in late fetal erythroid E. R. Bacon et al .

differentiation .
We , therefore , concluded that fetal progenitors are distinct from adult progenitors not only in their globin mRNA species but also at the level of transcription factors .
The transcription factor GATA-2 has the same binding specificity as GATA-1 .
It has been demonstrated , by gene targeting experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells , that GATA-2 plays a critical role in early hematopoiesis , particularly of the adult type ( 19 ) .
We tested the fetal culture for presence of GATA-2 RNA by RT-PCR ( 15 ) .
Some GATA-2 mRNA was observed during the first phase of the culture , supporting the suggested role of GATA-2 .
After EPO addition , only GATA-1 and no GATA-2 mRNA was detected ( data not shown ) .
Recruitment of Fetal Progenitors in Adulthood Some forms of high HbF production in adults are associated with anemic stress , and are thus expressed only in patients with B-thalassemia or sickle cell anemia but not in their parents or carrier siblings .
A possible mechanism is the recruitment of fetal cells , induced by the anemic stress .
The ability to distinguish between fetal and adult erythroid cells at the level of transcription factor allows the testing of this hypothesis .
We analyzed GATA-1 and SPI in erythroid cultures derived from peripheral blood of three B°-thalassemia patients , carrying $ B° mutations .
These usually have severe clinical presentation because of the complete absence of B-globin chains .
Patient A ( Fig .
4a ) , homozygous for the -globin mutation IVS2-1 , has a mild form of thalassemia ( intermedia ) owing to very high HbF production ( y/a chain synthesis ratio 0.42 at the age of 27 years ) .
His high HbF production in adulthood is not due to y-globin promoter mutations but to an unidentified factor that functions in the presence of anemic stress ( 20 ) .
As seen in Fig .
44 , his cultured erythroid cells present a `` fetal `` pattern ( high GATA-1/low SP1 levels ) , supporting the model of persistent recruitment of fetal progenitors in adulthood .
Additional evidence comes from other parameters associated with fetal erythropoiesis : high titer of i antigen , an elevated level of Gy ( 42 % ) and extensive ( 40 % ) y-globin DNA hypomethylation ( in his erythroid cells ) ( 21 ) .
On the other hand , his niece ( Patient B , Fig .
4h ) , who is also homozygous for the same B-globin mutation , has a severe clinical form of thalassemia ( major ) without high HbF ( y/a chain synthesis ratio 0.24 at the age of 2 years ) .
Because of the low number of cells , only two time points were analyzed .
Her culture differentiated rapidly , and the samples represent the later stages of erythroid differentiation .
Nevertheless , it can be seen that she presents `` adult `` pattern of transcription factors ( sig-nificant SP1 activity , which parallels GATA-1 ) .

express a high level of GATA-1 but only a low level of SP1 , in contrast to adult-derived cells , in which both transcription factors rise in parallel .
Moreover , we observed good correlation between the patterns of these transcription factors and the RNA species present .
High GATA-1 and high SP1 correlated with B-globin mRNA expression , as was seen both in the first phase of the fetal liver cultures and in the later stage of the CBL culture ( Fig .
1 , Day 12 ) .
On the other hand , high GATA-1 and low SPI were associated with only y-globin mRNA expression , as observed in the second phase of the fetal liver cultures .
Our experiments further indicate that the fetal and adult progenitors retain their identities when present together in the same environment in the CBL cultures .
Thus , commitment to the adult versus the fetal program is determined at a very early stage of differentiation , probably pre-BFUe , before the progenitors are placed in culture .
It is possible that the fate of the progenitor is determined by effector cells present in the respective erythropoietic organ ( liver versus bone marrow ) .
Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin ( HPFH ) in adulthood may be induced by several mechanisms .
These include mutations in cis to the y-globin genes ( promoter point mutations and large deletions in the B-globin gene cluster ) as well as unlinked genetic factors ( 22 and references cited therein ) .
In addition , HbF production may be induced by anemic stress .
The pattern of transcription factors in the differentiating erythroid cells of Patient A , with the high HbF , provides strong evidence for the activation of fetal progenitors .
However , the analyses of erythroid cultures of the other patients indicate that this is not a general phenomenon .
We have previously found that the genetic factor that allows high HbF production in Patient A is unlinked to the B-globin gene cluster ( 20 ) .
The level of HbF production in patients with sickle cell anemia and B-thalassemia is of high clinical significance , since y-globin peptides may alleviate the disease symptoms .
Several agents , such as hydroxyurea and butyrate derivatives , have been shown to increase y-globin gene expression in adult patients .
HbF and F-reticulocyte levels in sickle cell anemia patients were found to increase significantly 48-72 hr after the administration of hydroxyurea began ( 23 ) .
Similarly , y-globin synthesis followed the administration of butyrate closely ( 24 ) .
These findings suggest that the function of these drugs was exerted on cells that were already well on the maturation path 304 Molecular Medicine , Volume 1 , Number 3 , March 1995 way , after the point of commitment to the adult program .
Furthermore , experiments in erythroid cultures ( grown similarly to those studied here ) showed that both hydroxyurea and butyrate derivatives significantly elevated y-globin expression when added to the cultures 4 days after EPO ( 25,26 ) , beyond the CFUe stage .
We suggest that the activation of HbF by these agents is not via recruitment of fetal progenitors , but by a fundamentally different mechanism .
We hypothesize that the adult progenitors are capable of increased HbF production when appropriately trig-gered .
In the adult progenitor , the complete B-globin gene domain has an `` open ' `` chromatin configuration due to the activity of the LCR ( 27,28 ) .
We postulate that this `` open `` chromatin state , in the absence of specific repressors ( such as the s-globin gene silencer [ 29 ] ) , allows y-globin gene expression to be turned on in response to nonspecific , general gene activators .
Further studies are needed to clarify this issue , which has important therapeutic implications .
