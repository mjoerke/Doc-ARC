F. Perutz , February 25 , 1991 ABSTRACT A chromosomal translocation in a T-cell leukemia involving the short arm of human chromosome 11 at band 11p15 disrupts the rhombotin gene .
This gene encodes a protein with duplicated cysteine-rich regions called LIM domains , which show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins .
Two homologues of the rhombotin gene have now been isolated .
One of these , designated Rhom-2 , is located on human chromosome 11 at band 11p13 , where a cluster of T-cell leukemia-specific translocations occur ; all translocation breakpoints at l11p13 are upstream of the Rhom-2 gene .
Human and mouse Rhom-2 are highly conserved and , like rhombotin , encode two tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains .
Rhom-2 mRNA is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system , lung , kidney , liver , and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus .
The other gene , designated Rhom-3 , is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the LIM domain of rhombotin .
Since the Rhom-2 gene is such a common site of chromosomal damage in T-cell tumors , the consistency of translocations near the rhombotin gene was further examined .
A second translocation adjacent to rhombotin was found and at the same position as in the previous example .
Therefore , chromosome bands 11p15 ( rhombotin ) and 11p13 ( Rhom-2 ) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in T-cell leukemia , with the 11p15 target more rarely involved .
The results define the rhombotin gene family as a class of T-cell oncogenes with duplicated cysteine-rich LIM domains .
Human T-cell tumors carry specific chromosomal abnormal-ities , many of which involve a T-cell receptor gene locus ( for review , see ref .
1 ) on one side of the aberrant junction and newly defined presumptive oncogenes on the other .
One such gene is the recently identified rhombotin or Ttg-1 , which is located at the junction of a translocation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) t ( 11 ; 14 ) ( plS ; qll1 ) ( 2-4 ) .
The structure of the predicted rhombotin protein suggests that it consists of two tandemly arranged cysteine-rich re-gions , which were subsequently identified in three transcription factors appended to putative DNA binding and activation domains ( 5 , 6 ) , wherein they were termed LIM domains .
Although the function of LIM domains is unknown , it has been suggested to be in protein-protein interaction ( 7 ) .
One unique aspect of the rhombotin gene structure is the extremely high degree of evolutionary conservation among diverse species such as human and fly ( 4 , 8 ) , suggesting an important role in conserved differentiation functions .
Indeed , the role of rhombotin in development has been suggested by studies with transgenic mice , which demonstrate that this gene is involved in brain development ( 9 ) , a finding substan- The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

4367 tiated by expression studies using in situ hybridization ( 10 ) , which also indicated that other somatic tissues may be sites of rhombotin activity in mouse development ( 10 ) .
The possible role of LIM only proteins in development via catalyzing dimerization or dissociation of other proteins suggested that other genes encoding related LIM domain proteins may exist in the genome .
To investigate this possibility , we have used a rhombotin LIM-specific probe in low-stringency hybridization experiments and we have isolated two other rhombotin-like genes .
Interestingly , one of these two rhombotin-related genes was found near the previously described T-ALL `` region on chromosome 11p13 .
These findings show that alterations of at least two rhombotin gene family members consistently occur in T-ALL and therefore define a class of oncogenes particularly relevant to T-cell tumors . ``
MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA of patient S1 ( diagnosed in Saitama ) was extracted ( 11 ) from leukemic cells fixed in methanol acid for cyto-genetic analysis .
The 11p* and 14q~ chromosomal junctions were amplified by PCR with the following synthetic oligo-nucleotides : l1p* chromosomal junction , forward 5'-GATGGATCCACACACCCACCCGCAATCGCAC [ derived from 1l1p15 genomic sequences centromeric of the RPMI8402 translocation breakpoint ( ref .
2 ; unpublished data ) ] and backward 5-GATGAATTCCTTACTTGGTTC-CACAGTCACACG [ derived from the J81 sequence ( 2 ) ] under denaturation at 96°C for 2 min , annealing at 55°C for 2 min , and extension at 72°C for 2 min for a total of 30 cycles ; 14q~ chromosomal junction , forward CATGTTCAAATAGATATAG [ derived from 5 ' end of human D81 ( 12 ) ] and backward 5-GATGGATCCGG-GAACTTTTCTCATTAATTCTGAC [ derived from l1pl15 sequences telomeric of RPMI8402 translocation breakpoint ( 4 ) ] under the same conditions as described above .
PCR fragments were sequenced by the chain-termination method ( 13 ) .
The mouse genomic library has been described ( 14 ) .
A cDNA library of 2.5 x 10° plaque-forming units was constructed in Agt10 from poly ( A ) *-selected mRNA { purified using oligo [ d ( T ) ] -coated magnetic beads ( Dynal ) } isolated from embryonic day 16 BALB/c embryos using a Pharmacia cDNA synthesis kit .
All other procedures were as described ( 2 , 4 ) .
RESULTS Rhombotin Belongs to a Multigene Family .

identical homologs in the mouse and fly ( 8 ) .
This raised the possibility that the rhombotin gene belonged to a family of related genes with important functions in development .
To explore this possibility , we performed low-stringency hybridization experiments with a rhombotin exon 2 ( equivalent to the LIM-1 domain ) specific probe ( 4 ) .
As shown in Fig .
14 , at least three bands of various hybridization intensities were detected in EcoRI digests of human DNA : strong , interme-diate , and weakly hybridizing bands of 14 , 6 , and 2.1 kilo-bases ( kb ) , respectively .
Since the LIM domain encoding exons of rhombotin all reside within a 14-kb genomic EcoRI fragment ( Fig .
1B ; ref .
4 ) , the 6- and 2.1-kb hybridizing bands must correspond to two other rhombotin-like sequences .
A similar situation also holds for the mouse and rat genomes ( Fig .
1 ) .
Accordingly , we group these potential genes into a family which we term the rhombotin gene family .
The Rhom-2 Gene Is Located Close to the T-ALL Breakpoint Cluster Region on 11p13 .
Somatic cell hybrid lines were used to investigate the chromosomal localization of the 6- and 2.1-kb rhombotin-like genes in the human genome .
Using DNA from a hybrid containing only human chromosome 11 , we found that , in addition to rhombotin itself , the 2.1-kb faintly hybridizing band , but not the 6-kb band , also originates from chromosome 11 ( Fig .
2 ) .
This raised the possibility that the former may be associated with the previously described T-ALL `` region on the short arm of chromosome 11 , frequently disrupted in T-ALL by t ( 11l ; 14 ) ( pl3 ; ql1l ) ( 11 , 17-20 ) .
We therefore hybridized the human rhombotin exon 2-specific probe to a set of previously derived cosmid clones ( cos3.11 , cos2 , cos13.5 , and cos13.8 ) spanning ~100 kb around the T-ALL®* `` region ( 20 ) .
A hybridization signal was indeed detected in cosmid cos13.5 , suggesting the presence of a LIM domain-related sequence at l11p13 .
Accordingly , the nucleotide sequence of the cross-hybridizing fragment was obtained and the results ( Fig .
2C ) demonstrate the presence of a sequence with a very high degree of homology to the LIM-1 domain of rhombotin exon 2 ( 4 ) .
We have therefore provisionally named this gene located at 11p13 Rhom-2 .

( 4 ) Analysis of a mouse-human somatic cell hybrid ( Horl9D2R1 ; ref .
15 ) , carrying human chromosome 11 .
EcoRI digests were fractionated and hybridized at low stringency with a rhombotin exon 2-specific fragment .
Note that the 14-kb rhombotin fragment and the 2.1-kb cross-hybridizing fragment ( i.e .
, Rhom-2 ) , but not the 6-kb cross-hybridizing fragment , are found in the human DNA complement of the hybrid .
This suggests nonlinkage of the 6- and 2.1-kb cross-hybridizing fragments .

Human rhombotin and Rhom-2 fragments are indicated by arrowheads .
( C ) Nucleotide sequence and translation , in single-letter code , of a Rhom-2 exon homologous to rhombotin exon 2 .
The cysteine and histidine residues characteristic of LIM domains are circled .
Also indicated are the possible splice junctions flanking this exon , derived both from comparison to the rhombotin gene structure ( 4 ) and from the obtained mouse cDNA sequence ( see Fig .

Note that the 3 ' splice junction occurs at precisely the same place in both rhombotin and Rhom-2 genes , whereas the 5 ' intron-exon boundary is slightly variable , reminiscent of the previously described comparison between human and fly homologs of the rhombotin gene ( 8 ) .
A Pst I site near the 5 ' end of this exon is underlined , and the Kpn I site at the 3 ' splice junction is overlined .
This Pst I/Kpn I fragment was used to screen a mouse genomic library to obtain the mouse homolog of the Rhom-2 LIM-1 domain .
( D ) Nucleotide sequence and translation of a Rhom-3 exon homologous to rhomobotin exon 2 .
Cysteine and histidine residues characteristic of LIM domains are circled .

was used to confirm the identity of the 2.1-kb cross-hybridizing rhombotin-like gene in genomic DNA .
Fig .
2B demonstrates that the 2.1-kb EcoRI fragment , weakly cross-hybridizing with the rhombotin exon 2 probe , indeed represents the Rhom-2 gene to which it hybridizes strongly .
Evolutionary Conservation of the Rhom-2 Gene .
The Pst I/Kpn I restriction fragment covering most of the above-described human exon of the Rhom-2 gene ( Fig .
2C ) was used to isolate the mouse homolog of this locus from a mouse genomic library ( 14 ) .
The sequence of a relevant part of phage Al3-1 shows that , over the stretch analyzed , the mouse homolog of the Rhom-2 gene is completely conserved ( Fig .
3A ) .
Using the PCR , we prepared the mouse homolog of the human Pst I/Kpn I fragment ( designated Pst I/Kpn I* ) by introducing a Kpn I site at the 3 ' splice site and screened a Agt10 cDNA library made from embryonic day 16 mouse mRNA .
The longest open reading frame obtained from sequence analysis of several overlapping cDNA clones predicts a protein of 158 amino acids ( Fig .
3B ) .
Like the rhombotin protein ( 3 , 4 ) ( to which Rhom-2 is compared in Fig .
3C ) , the predicted Rhom-2 protein contains two LIM domains , with no obvious homeo- or activation domains .
In the Rhom-2 gene , however , there is no evidence for alternative 5 ' ends as described for the 11p15 locus ( 4 ) .
The Third Rhombotin-like Gene Is Highly Conserved but Not Linked to Rhombotin .
The data in Fig .
2 demonstrate that the third band , herein designated Rhom-3 , is not linked to rhombotin since it is not on chromosome 11 .
The nature of the Rhom-3 gene was determined after isolation of part of the human genomic segment encoding the equivalent of rhombotin exon 2 from a genomic library ( L. F. , A. Forster , K. Campbell , and T.H.R .
, unpublished data ) .
The sequence of this exon in Rkom-3 is given in Fig .
2D , which shows that the derived rhom-3 protein sequence has 5 amino acid differences of the 72 ( 93 % homology ) .
Thus , even though the rhombotin and Rhom-3 genes are on different chromosomes , their sequences are conserved and Rhom-3 also encodes a LIM domain protein .
Chromosomal Translocations Occur Upstream of the Rhom-2 Gene .
The location and orientation of the Rhom-2 gene suggested that a methylation-free DNA region called HTF ' ( 20 ) might be the transcriptional start site of the Rhom-2 gene .
To investigate this possibility , we performed a preliminary analysis of the Rhom-2 gene structure by using restriction fragments prepared from different parts of the Rhom-2 gene derived from a mouse cDNA clone ( Fig .
4A ) in hybridization experiments ( Fig .
4B ) with the set of human Rhom-2 cosmids described above .
Using genomic fragments around HTF linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene ( 4 ) , we found promoter activity associated with the 1.3-kb BamHI/Sac II fragment ( Fig .
4 B and C ) , indicating that the transcriptional start site of Rhom-2 is within this fragment .
The transcriptional orientation of the Rhom-2 gene is therefore analogous to that of the rhombotin gene at 11p15 ( ref .
4 ) .
In contrast to the rhombotin locus on 11p15 , however , the Rhom-2 gene seems to be quite small .
Fig .
4B shows the outlined genomic structure of the Rhom-2 gene and the known translocation breakpoints in the T-ALL `` region ( 11 ) , illustrating that these all occur within 25 kb of the presumed transcriptional start site of Rhom-2 and are all located at the 5 ' end of the gene .
Expression of the Rhom-2 Gene in Mouse Development .
The rhombotin gene is expressed early in mouse development and shows segment specific expression in the embryonic hind-brain ( 9 ) .
Despite the fact that it is associated with a T-cell tumor , the most abundant site of expression is the central nervous system , with only extremely low levels of expression in the thymus ( 9 , 10 ) .
In view of the general similarities between rhombotin and Rhom-2 protein structures and their implication in T-cell tumorigenesis , we studied the expres- Proc .

sion of Rhom-2 in mouse development .
Northern hybridization experiments ( Fig .
5 ) show that the Rhom-2 gene is expressed early in development ( from embryonic day 12 onward ) , and expression continues in the adult animal .
A variety of adult tissues were analyzed for Rhom-2 mRNA and all showed a roughly consistent level of expression with the interesting exception of thymus , where expression is low .
Finally , all subregions of the brain that we analyzed showed Rhom-2 mRNA expression ( Fig .

Disruption of the Rhombotin Gene on 11p15 Is a Consistent but Rare Feature of a Subset of T-ALL .
Although the T-ALL `` `` is a major site for translocations in childhood T-cell leukemia , the translocation to 11p15 has only been cloned in one example ( 2 ) .
This disparity is hard to explain now that it is established that the protein products of the affected genes both possess LIM structures .
However , several t ( 11 ; 14 ) ( p15 ; q11 ) translocations have been described in T-cell tumors ( 22 ) , and a new case ( S1 ) of t ( 11 ; 14 ) ( p15 ; q11 ) was recently identified .
Filter hybridization experiments using a full-length rhombotin cDNA ( pCT2 ; ref .
4 ) and a probe ( pHB2.1 ; ref .
4 ) located upstream of the translocation breakpoint in RPMI8402 cells revealed a similar rearrangement of the rhombotin gene in S1 and RPMI8402 ( data not shown ) , suggesting similar structures for derivative chromosomes in both samples .
The precise breakpoint in S1 was determined for the 14q~ and 1l1ip*t chromosomal junctions by PCR amplification .
Sequence analysis of the amplified products ( Fig .
6 ) showed that the breakpoint on chromosome 11p15 in sample S1 is identical to the breakpoint in RPMI8402 ( 2 , 3 ) .
The 11p* junction in S1 DNA indicates that chromosome 11p15 sequences are appended to a D,2-N-D ; 33-N-J ; 1 join via a third N region .
Hence , the structure and sequence of the 11p* junction is entirely different in S1 and RPMI8402 .
Thus , although chromosome translocation to the rhombotin gene on chromosome 11p15 is rare , the site of translocation nevertheless is a recurrent target for chromosomal abnormalities in T-ALL .
DISCUSSION Our results show that the rhombotin gene ( located at human chromosome 11p15 ) is a member of a family of genes whose protein products contain two tandemly arranged cysteine rich LIM domains .
A second member of the rhombotin gene family , designated Rhom-2 , has been studied in detail and found to be ~50 % similar to the rhombotin gene .
The gene is located very close to the previously described conserved T-ALL `` region of human chromosome l1p13 , which is frequently disrupted in chromosomal translocations occurring in T-ALL .

, the apparent D ; 2-D33 join and the different N-region sequences ( note the similarity of the Ds3 germ-line sequence and the putative N region occurring between D ; 3 and J ; 1 segments on the S1 l11p* chromosome ) .
j is frequently translocated ( 11 ) and the rhombotin gene more rarely but specifically so in T-ALL ( this paper ) it defines the rhombotin genes as an oncogene family .
We have not as yet investigated whether the Rhom-3 gene has association with chromosomal abnormalities .
Several findings suggest that the mechanisms of activation of the rhombotin and Rhom-2 genes in T-ALL are very similar .
It seems rather unlikely that sequences of the T-cell receptor loci function in rhombotin or Rhom-2 gene regulation after translocation .
In view of the genomic location of the promoters for rhombotin ( 4 ) and apparently also of Rhom-2 ( this paper ) , activation via translocation probably occurs through truncation ( i.e .
, removal ) of sequences normally involved in transcriptional control .
This is all the more likely since the T-ALL `` region , although apparently not tran-scribed , is conserved in evolution ( 24 ) .
The frequent disruption in translocation t ( 11 ; 14 ) or t ( 7 ; 11 ) ( 11 , 17-20 ) therefore suggests the importance of this conserved region in transcriptional regulation of the Rhom-2 gene .
No leukemic cells were available with t ( 11 ; 14 ) ( pl3 ; q1l1l ) to facilitate a study of Rhom-2 mRNA levels in the tumor , but truncation of the promoter/control region is likely to interfere with the regulation of transcription and lead to inappropriate levels as in the case of rhombotin ( 10 ) .
Comparative sequence analysis of mouse cDNAs for the rhombotin and Rhom-2 genes shows that the amino acid sequences of the two proteins are 50 % homologous .
The positions and spacings of the residues characteristic of the cysteine-rich LIM domains are perfectly conserved , as is a stretch of nine amino acids linking the two LIM domains .
The function of the rhombotin , Rhom-2 , and Rhom-3 gene products is not yet known but the unique structure of the rhombotin protein has led to the suggestion that LIM domains function as protein dimerization motifs ( 7 , 8 ) and rhombotin-like proteins act as regulators of transcription factors carrying DNA binding and LIM domains ( 5 , 6 ) .
Structural similarities to several metal binding proteins have been noted ( 3 , 5-8 ) , but the LIM domain does not have the cysteine spacing typical of a zinc finger .
However , Cys-Xaa ; -Cys-Xaa , -Cys motifs have been shown to bind zinc ( 25 ) so zinc ligands may bind to the LIM domain .
Alternatively , the LIM domains share some homology with ferredoxins ( 26 ) in the duplicated sequence ( where n is a variable number of residues ) where the three Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 88 ( 1991 ) 4371 closely linked cysteines bind to three of the irons in a distorted [ 4Fe-48 ] cube , and the more distal cysteine binds to the fourth iron .
In addition , the LIM domains contain two further Cys-Xaa , -Cys sequences , which could be either a third [ 4Fe-48 ] or a [ 2Fe-28 ] center .
Possession of the three centers would make a powerful redox protein .
Precedent redox mechanisms in oncogene transcriptional control is found in the DNA binding activity of the fos/jun heterodimer , which is modulated by redox of a cysteine in the DNA binding site ( 27 ) , apparently catalyzed by a separate nuclear factor ( 28 ) .
Although there is no formal evidence for cellular transformation by rhombotin family genes , our finding of a second LIM domain protein at a site of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities underscores the importance of the rhombotin LIM domain gene family as presumptive T-cell oncogenes and strengthens the case for deregulated LIM protein expression contributing to T-cell oncogenesis .
