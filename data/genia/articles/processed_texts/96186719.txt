* Unité d ' Immunologie and Unité de Chimie Organique , `` Institut Pasteur , 75724 Paris Cedex 15 , France Received 20 November 1995/Accepted 23 January 1996 This work aimed to ascertain the role of « B-responsive elements of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) enhancer not only in early initiation but also in long-term maintenance of proviral transcription in cells of the monocytic lineage .
For this purpose , we used three main approaches .
The first was to abruptly terminate tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-KB binding to the enhancer sequences in Ul monocytic cells , using a short pulse of exogenous tumor necrosis factor , This resulted in concomitant decrease in nuclear DNA-binding activity and endogenous long terminal repeat transcriptional activity .
The second was to suppress the permanent NF-KB translocation induced by HIV-1 replication itself in chronically infected U937 cells , using a specific proteasome inhibitor ( Z-LLL-H ) .
As early as 2 h after addition of the inhibitor to the culture medium , there was an inhibition of both constitutive activation of NF- « B and HIV-1 genome expression .
The third approach was to monitor the replication competence in U937 cells of an infectious HIV-1 provirus carrying point mutations in the « B-responsive elements of both long terminal repeats .
Compared with its wild-type counterpart , this mutated provirus showed a profoundly decreased , Z-LLL-H-insensitive transcriptional and replicative activity in U937 monocytes .
Together , our results indicate that occupancy of the viral enhancer by NF-B ( p50/p65 ) heterodimers is required for ongoing transcription of integrated HIV provirus in monocytes , even in cells chronically infected and permanently producing functional HIV Tat protein .
Thus , the ability of HIV-1 replication to activate NF-KB is crucial to the intense self-perpetuated viral transcription observed in cells of the monocytic lineage .
Transcription of the human immunodeficiency type 1 ( HIV-1 ) genome depends on the intracellular environment into which the virus integrates and is regulated by a complex interplay between viral regulatory proteins and cellular transcription factors interacting with the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) region .
In 1987 , a direct correlation was established between the up-regulation of LTR transcriptional activity during T-cell activation and the induction of the nuclear factor NF-kB , which binds to the two repeated motifs in the core enhancer element of the LTR ( 45 ) .
Since this early study , the notion of the critical dependence of the HIV-1 LTR function on NF-kB DNA-binding activity has received considerable experimental support ( reviewed in reference 25 ) .
The human family of ReI/NF- « B proteins is composed of p50 , p52 , p65 , c-Rel , and RelB ( reviewed in reference 25 ) .
While almost all combinations of homo- and heterodimers may exist , NF- « B , which is rapidly activated in response to extra-cellular signals , is typically composed of p50 and p65 subunits .
While p50 does not appear to possess a domain for transcriptional activation , the p65 subunit does , which accounts for the transcriptional activity of the NF-kB heterodimer ( 20 , 58 ) .
The p50 subunit is derived from a p105 precursor by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of the C-terminal region of p105 ( 46 ) .
When expressed from an alternatively spliced p105 mRNA lacking the p50 coding sequences , this C-terminal region ( IxBy ) preferentially inhibits the DNA-binding activity of p50 * Corresponding author .

2930 homodimers ( 33 , 35 ) .
The activity of NF-KB is controlled by the inhibitor protein IxBa ( or MAD3 ) ( 6 , 29 ) , which , in common with IkBy , Bel-3 , and IBB ( 62 , 66 ) , contains multiple ankyrin repeats .
Exposure of cells to signals which activate NF- « B results in the rapid phosphorylation and degradation of IxBa ( 7 , 10 , 30 , 40 , 60 ) .
Degradation of IxBa is rapidly followed by induction of IkxBa « mRNA through a mechanism regulated by the interaction of NF- « B with DNA recognition sites located in the promoter of the IxBa gene ( 14 , 34 , 60 ) .
Newly synthesized IxBa protein appears transiently in the nucleus , where it negatively regulates NF- « B-dependent transcription ( 3 ) .
The multicatalytic 268 proteasome complex , shown to catalyze the generation of antigenic peptides for presentation of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen molecules ( 54 ) , is responsible for the ATP-dependent proteolytic degradation of IxBa , as shown by the use of peptide aldehydes which specifically inhibit the chymotrypsin activity of the proteasome ( 46 ) .
Furthermore , it has been proven that covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains to IxBa « is required for protea-some-activated degradation of the protein both in vitro ( 13 ) and in vivo following cell activation ( 55 ) .
Interesting evidence has also emerged that the enhancer-independent inducibility of the HIV-1 LTR may involve the participation of other cellular factors ( reviewed in reference 21 ) and the p53 protein ( 26 ) .
Transcriptional synergism between distinct , virus-inducible enhancer elements on the activity of the human beta interferon gene promoter has been reported ( 16 ) .
Indeed , in the HIV-1 LTR context , NF-kB may act in synergy with the transcription factor Sp1 , either through the establishment of a direct interaction ( 48 , 49 ) or after Sp1 voL .
70 , 1996 phosphorylation ( 64 ) .
A complex picture of HIV-1 LTR regulation has emerged from these accumulated data .
However , analyses performed in normal T lymphocytes and primary macrophages emphasized the essential role of NF-kB DNA-binding activity for the initiation of LTR transcriptional activity and HIV-1 Tat-dependent LTR transactivation ( 2 , 43 ) .
We have recently shown an absolute requirement of enhancer sequences for the establishment of HIV-1 infection in peripheral blood CD4 lymphocytes ( 2 ) .
This study led to the notion that NF- « B p65/p50 heterodimer binding to the enhancer domain plays a driving role in HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity by both initiating this activity and cooperating with the Tat protein , thus constituting a prerequisite for the establishment of HIV-1 replication in normal T lymphocytes .
In monocytes/macrophages , NF-kB DNA-binding activity and HIV-1 LTR reporter gene expression are also coordinately inducible ( 5 , 24 , 43 , 47 , 56 ) .
In this cell type , the contribution of enhancer occupancy by NF-kB to HIV-1 replication has been analyzed primarily in myelomonocytic U1 cells .
This cell line , originally cloned from the chronically HIV-1 ; , promonocytic cell line U937 , was found to have very low basal expression of two integrated HIV genome copies but to retain the ability to produce large quantities of infectious virus when stimulated ( 19 ) .
The inducing effect of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) on endogenous HIV-1 replication in U1 cells has been correlated with the activation of NF-kB binding to the viral enhancer ( 18 , 24 , 51 ) and the stimulation of newly transcribed HIV-1 RNAs ( 50 , 51 ) .
In monocytes/macrophages and T lym-phocytes , the two main cellular targets of HIV , it appears that of all of the multiple cellular factors which interact with the HIV-1 LTR and modulate its function , the Rel/kB family is the principal inducer of HIV-1 transcription .
However , a remarkable feature of the HIV-monocyte/macrophage relationship is that HIV-1 replication itself activates NF- « B transcription factors in this cell lineage ( 5 , 56 , 57 ) .
In addition , increased transcription of the p105 precursor replenishes the p50 pool and allows the observed permanent activation of NF-KB to be sustained ( 47 ) .
Increased IxBa turnover appears to account for the constitutive NF-kB DNA-binding activity in HIV-1-infected monocytes ( 38 ) .
However , expression of the viral transactivator Tat in HIV-l-infected U937 cells also participates in maintaining this high-level , permanent HIV-1 genome transcription , since deletion of the Tat-responsive element sequence suppressed most , but not all , transcriptional activity of an HIV-1 LTR luciferase expression vector transiently transfected into chronically infected U937 cells ( 5 ) .
Thus , the role of HIV enhancer occupancy in permanently increased HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity is still unclear .
Hence , many questions concerning the importance of NF-kB DNA-binding activity in HIV-1 replication in cells of the myelomonocytic lineage remain to be answered .
First , is NF- « kB LTR-dependent transcription absolutely required for the establishment of HIV-1 replication ?
Second , is HIV Tat ex-pression , induced as soon as LTR function is ongoing , sufficient to perpetuate proviral transcription in an enhancer-inde-pendent manner ?
Third , the kB binding site in the simian immunodeficiency virus LTR has been demonstrated to be absolutely essential for efficient viral replication in primary macaque macrophages ( 8 ) .
In light of the close relationship between HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus and the high degree of conservation of NF- « B sites , can these results be extrapolated to HIV-1 infection in human monocytic cells ?
Such questions are particularly relevant with respect to mac-rophages , in which HIV-1 transcription and replication occur in a persistent manner , in the absence of viral cytopathogenic PERSISTENT REPLICATION OF HIV-1 IN MONOCYTES REQUIRES NF- « B 2931 effects ( reviewed in references 22 , 32 , and 41 ) .
They are critical questions , because monocytes/macrophages are likely to be the main cellular sites of the very intense viral replication observed in infected patients ( 31 , 65 ) .
Using the U937 monocytic cell model , we have now addressed these questions by suppressing either the NF- « B-binding elements by specific mutation or the permanent nuclear translocation of NF-kB induced by HIV-1 replication .
We monitored the consequences of such manipulations on the transcription of chronic HIV-1 genome expression .
In latently infected U1 cells , we have used a recently described ( 3 ) method allowing a controlled , transient NF- « B activation to show that early disappearance of nuclear NF- « B-binding activity results in an abortive induction of HIV provirus transcription after a pulse of TNF .
Our results provide support for the conclusion that both initiation and perpetuation of integrated HIV provirus transcription are strictly dependent on the actual occupancy of the enhancer sequence by NF- « B .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell cultures and infections .
The monocytic cell line U937 , latently HIV-infected U1 cells ( 19 ) ( obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program ) , and the lymphoblastoid T-cell line CEM were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and glutamine .
They were passaged twice a week at a concentration of 2.5 X 10° cells per ml .
Infection of U937 cells with mycoplasma-negative HIV-1 ; a , was performed as described previously ( 5 ) .
The production of infectious supernatants from either wild-type ( wt ) or « B-mutated ( xB-Mut ) HIV ( see below ) was performed in CEM , U937 , or Cos-7 cells .
Cos-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and glutamine and passaged every 3 days .
Ten micrograms of each complementary Bg/l-Neol-di-gested proviral construct was cotransfected for 12 to 16 h into subconfluent Cos-7 cells seeded 1 day before transfection at 4 X 10° cells per 75-cm* flask , using Lipofectamine reagent ( GibcoBRL ) .
After transfection , cells were trypsinized and cultured for an additional 48 h before harvesting of the viral supernatants .
U937 and CEM cells were resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and electroporated at 250 V and 960 wF with 15 pg of DNA per 10 `` cells .
Cell-free supernatants were assayed for the HIV-1 p24 `` protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( Dupont ) , and all infections were normalized to the p24®* levels ( 5 X 10° to 15 x 10° cells infected with a total 20 to 150 ng of p24 `` antigen ) .
The threshold of p24° `` * production detectability was 2.5 pg/ml .
Proviral constructs .
The HIV-1 wt and « B-Mut constructs were described previously ( 28 ) .
Plasmid puc§'HIV-arm contains a BermHI-SphI fragment derived from the molecular clone HIV-1SF2 linked to an SpHI-Neo !
fragment originating from the human T-cell leukemia virus IB pBH10 clone .
puc3'HIV-arm contains the NeoI-Narl sequence of HIV-1SF2 .
The wt and its « B-Mut versions differ only in a 5-bp substitution ( AAGGG and TTTAA , respectively ) in the enhancer regions of the 5° and 3 ' LTRs .
These noninfectious 5 ' and 3 ' plasmids produce infectious virus upon Bg/I-Neol digestion and cotransfection .
Preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts .
U1 cells were treated with 5 ng of TNF ( provided by the Medical Research Council AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program ) per ml and cultivated for 2 h at 37°C .
After this pulse-chase , experiments were performed as previously described ( 3 ) .
Cells were washed twice with 50 ml of prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) .
Half of the culture was resuspended in prewarmed culture medium in the absence of TNF ( chase ) , and the other half was resuspended in the presence of 5 ng of TNF per ml for an additional 6 h. Unless indicated otherwise , in experiments using the peptide aldehyde Z-LLL-H ( 46 ) ( provided by F. Baleux , Unité de Chimie Or-ganique , Pasteur Institute ) , uninfected U937 cells were pretreated for 110 min with this reagent ( at concentrations indicated in the figure legends ) before the addition of TNF to culture media for an additional 10 min .
HIV-1-infected U937 cells were incubated with the inhibitor for the same total time ( 120 min ) .
In all cases , cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in cold PBS before extraction .
Sedimented cells were resuspended in lysis containing protease inhibitors ( 5 ) and phosphatase inhibitors ( sodium vanadate [ 1 mM ] , P-nitrophenyl phosphate [ 10 mM ] , B-glycerophosphate [ 10 mM } , sodium fluoride [ 5 mM } , and okadaic acid [ 200 nM ] ) .
After microcentrifugation , cytoplasmic fractions were collected and nuclear proteins were extracted in hypertonic buffer as previously described ( 5 ) .
EMSA .
The electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) was performed with 4 pg of nuclear extract incubated for 15 min at room temperature with a [ y- `` °P ] ATP-labeled , double-stranded oligonucleotide containing either the HIV-1 LTR binding site for NF- « B ( 5-ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGACTTTCCAGG GA-3 ' ) or the consensus binding site for Spl ( 5'-GGGAGGCGTGGCCTGGG CGGGACTGGGGAGTGGC-3 ' ) .
Samples were analyzed in nondenaturing 6 % polyacrylamide gels .
Competition experiments were performed by adding a 40 2932 - JACOUE ET AL .
fold molar excess of homologous , unlabeled oligonucleotide to each sample prior to addition of the probe .
Components of TNF-induced DNA-binding complexes in U1 nuclear extracts were identified by incubation with specific polyclonal antibodies directed against p50 or p65 recombinant protein .
p50 antibodies were affinity-purified immunoglobulins obtained from an immune polyclonal rabbit serum generated by immunization with recombinant p50 .
p65 antibodies were affinity-purified immunoglobulins obtained from an immune polyclonal rabbit raised again a peptide corresponding to amino acids 531 to 550 mapping within the carboxy-terminal region of human p65 ( antibody C20 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Nuclear run-on assays .
Isolation of nuclei and run-on transcription assays were performed by using a modification ( 39 ) of the original procedure ( 23 ) .
To prepare nuclei , cells were quickly disrupted with 1 ml of lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris [ pH 7.4 ] , 10 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgC ) ; ) containing 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 and layered onto 30 % sucrose in 50 mM Tris-HCI [ pH 8.2 ] -5 mM MgCl , -0.1 mM EDTA .
Pelleted nuclei were resuspended and stored under liquid nitrogen in 40 % glycerol-50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.2 ) -5 mM MgCl , -0.1 mM EDTA .
Run-on assays were performed on 10 `` nuclei incubated with [ « - `` `` P ] UTP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ; Am-ersham ) for 30 min at 37°C .
Labeled RNAs were purified by using Qiagen columns as specified by the manufacturer .
Labeled RNAs ( 5 X 10° to 10 `` cpm ) were hybridized for 3 days at 50°C with linearized , denatured plasmid DNA immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes ( Schleicher & Schuell ) .
The filters were washed and treated with RNase A ( 100 mg/m ! )
prior to autoradiography .
Plasmids probes were as follows : pLTRXluc ( 59 ) linearized by HindIII ( fragment size , 80 bp ) , pLgagSN containing an EcoRI-Bg/II PCR-amplified HIV-1 ; a ; fragment cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI-digested pLXSN vector and linearized by EcoRI ( fragment size , 1,500 bp ) , proviral construct pBru-2 ( 44 ) linearized by BamHI ( localized in the env sequence ) ( fragment size , 8,063 bp ) , pB-actin ( provided by A. Hovanessian ) containing the B-actin cDNA ( 53 ) cloned into the BamHI site of pGEM and linearized outside the B-actin cDNA by Xbal ( fragment size , 1,170 bp ) , and control plasmid pUcBM20 ( Boehringer ) linearized by EcoRI ( 2,300 bp ) .
Hybridization background was estimated by probing in vitro [ « - `` `` P ] UTP-labeled RNAs with EcoRI-linearized pUcBM20 .
Levels of in vitro-transcribed RNAs was estimated after 2 to 3 days of exposure by scanning the membranes with a digital imaging system , and computer-generated images were analyzed to obtain densitometric values ( PhosphorImager model 250 and Molecular Dynamics program ) .
Nucleic acid purification and PCR analysis .
As described previously ( 4 , 67 ) , DNA used for PCR amplification was extracted by lysis of cells in urea lysis buffer ( 4.7 M urea , 1.3 % [ wt/vol ] sodium dodecyl sulfate , 0.23 M NaCl , 0.67 mM EDTA [ pH 8 ] , 6.7 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 8 ] ) , extracted with phenol-chloroform , and precipitated in ethanol .
Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures by using TRIzol reagent as specified by the manufacturer ( GibcoBRL ) .
To remove all traces of DNA , RNA preparations were subjected to digestion with RNase-free DNase I ( Boehringer ) for 1 h at 37°C .
RNA ( < 3 pg ) was subjected to hybridization with 100 ng of the 3 ' primer ( antisense ) , and first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( Superscript ; GibcoBRL ) in a volume of 20 pl for 1 h at 37°C ; 5 to 10 pl of these cDNA products was subsequently subjected to analysis by PCR .
PCR amplifications were performed as previously described ( 67 ) , using 50 ng of the 3 ' primer and 25 ng of the 5 ' primer ( sense ) end labeled with *P ( 5 x 10° to 10° cpm ) in a buffer containing 0.25 mM each of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates , 50 mM NaCl , 25 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8 ) , 5 mM MgCl , , 100 pg of bovine serum albumin per ml , and 1.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase ( Amersham ) .
Unless indicated otherwise , amplification conditions were as follows : 5 min of incubation at 94°C followed by 1 min at 94°C and 2 min at 65°C for 30 cycles .
PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis on 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by direct autoradiography of the dried gels .
For quantification analysis , gels were recorded with a digital imaging system , and computer-generated images were analyzed to obtain densitometric values ( PhosphorImager model 250 and Molecular Dynamics program ) .
The amount of RNA species was estimated by using a modification of the original method ( 27 ) .
Aliquots of the PCR amplification products were removed during the exponential phase of the PCR .
Specific RNA signals were plotted on a semilog scale against the number of cycles , and quantitation of a given RNA species was obtained by extrapolation to the zero cycle .
The PCR primers of HIV-1 used were described previously ( 1 , 4 , 67 ) .
For HIV-1 DNA detection , primers M667 ( 5-GGCTAACTAGGGAACCCACTG-3 ' ) and AA55 ( 5-CTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGAC-3 ' ) were used .
This pair amplifies a fragment of 140 bp .
Quantitation of HIV-1 DNA was performed by analyzing a standard curve of dilutions of cloned HIV-1 ; a ; DNA linearized outside viral sequences .
Use of a pair of oligonucleotides complementary to the B-actin cDNA sequence ( 53 ) , sense ( 5 % -GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3 ' ) and | antisense - ( 5'-CGGTTGGCCTTGGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3 ' ) , yields a 244-bp amplified product .
The oligonucleotide primers used for detection of total HIV-1 RNAs were antisense oligonucleotide M668 ( 4 ) ( 5'-CGCGTCCCT GTTCGGGCGCC-3 ' ) combined with M667 for PCR amplification of a 161-bp product .
Oligonucleotide primers LA45 ( sense ; 5-GGCITAGGCATCTC CTATGGC-3 ' ) and L¥41 ( antisense ; 5-TGTCGGGTCCCCTCGTTGCTGG-3 ' ) ( 4 ) allowed the detection of a 123-bp PCR product specific for HIV-1 tat/rev spliced RNA .
Nested PCR was performed for the detection of HIV-1 RNAs prepared from U937 cells infected with wt and « B-Mut constructs .
The outer primers were M661 J. Virou .

Inhibition of TNF-induced NF- « B DNA-binding activity in U1 cells .
U1 cells were exposed for 2 h to TNF and then extensively washed in prewarmed PBS .
Aliquots were processed to obtain nuclear extracts , nuclei ( Fig .
24 ) , and total RNA ( Fig .
2B ) .
The remaining cells were reseeded in fresh culture medium in either the absence ( chase ) or the presence of TNF for an additional 6 h. EMSA was done with 4 pg of nuclear extracts and oligonucleotides representing xB ( lanes 1 to 9 ) and Sp1 ( lanes 10 to 14 ) motifs .
Competition with a 40-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was used to confirm the specificity of the DNA-binding activity detected ( lanes 5 and 14 ) .
Anti-p63 and -p50 ( « p65 and « p50 ) polyclonal rabbit antisera or rabbit preim-mune serum ( PT ; 1 pl ) was added with the sample 15 min prior to addition of the radiolabeled xB probe ( lanes 7 to 9 ) .

Three microliters of the first-round nonlabeled products was used as the template for the second amplification reaction .
Low-molecular-weight DNA extraction was performed as previously described ( 5 ) .
DNA extracted from cell nuclei isolated 30 min after transfection was analyzed quantitatively after transfer of serial dilutions onto a nylon membrane ( Amersham ) and hybridization with a y-*°P-labeled HIV-1 gag probe .
RESULTS U1 cells pulsed by TNF and then maintained in its absence exhibit transient expression of nuclear NF-kB DNA-binding activity .
To assess the contribution of activated NF-kB factor to the ongoing transcriptional activity of the endogenous HIV-1 LTR in TNF-treated U1 cells , we used a recently described ( 3 ) experimental system in which induction of early NF-kB DNA-binding activity results in a transient expression of this transcription factor , followed by its early disappearance from the nuclear compartment .
U1 cells were treated for 2 h with TNF ( pulse ) and cultured for 6 h in its absence ( chase ) .
As shown in Fig .
1 , these experimental conditions resulted in transient TNF-induced NF-kB binding to the xB motifs of the HIV-1 enhancer , since this complex is clearly reduced ( lane 4 ) compared with its binding activity in nuclear extracts from cells continuously treated with TNF ( lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The specificity of the NF-kB/DNA complexes detected in TNF-treated U1 cells was proven by competition with unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides ( lane 5 ) .
From results of assays using p65 and p50 rabbit polyclonal antibodies ( lanes 8 and 9 ) , we concluded that most of the NF-kB DNA-binding activity was due to bona fide heterodimers composed by p50 and p65 proteins .
To determine whether primarily NF-kB was affected in these experimental conditions , we analyzed the binding of the transcription factor Sp1 , which is essential for HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity ( 21 ) .
In contrast to NF-kB , Sp1 DNA-binding activity was constitutively detectable in uninduced cells and , depending on the experiment , remained unchanged or increased slightly upon TNF stimulation ( lanes 10 and 11 ) .
While NF-kB DNA-binding activity is clearly reduced following transient exposure to TNF ( lane 4 ) , Spl DNA-binding activity is not significantly affected ( compare lane 13 with lanes 11 and 12 ) .

Down-regulation of HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity parallels the decrease of NF- « B DNA-binding activity in TNF-pulsed U1 cells .
We tested whether the TNF-induced HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity paralleled the transient expression of NF-kB DNA-binding activity .
The rate of endogenous HIV-1 proviral transcription was assessed by nuclear run-on analysis in TNF-pulsed U1 cells ( Fig .
2A ) .
In vitro [ « - `` `` P ] JUTP-labeled nuclear RNAs were hybridized to immobilized HIV-1 DNA fragments ( Xhol-HindIII fragment of the LTR , gag sequence , and a pBru-2 subgenomic fragment linearized in the env sequence ) .
In vitro-labeled nuclear RNAs were probed with B-actin DNA to ensure that transcriptional activity of this cellular gene was insensitive to the experimental conditions used .
The hybridization signals obtained with the three different HIV-1 DNA probes were recorded by using a digital imaging system ( Molecular Dynamics program ) and normalized relative to the B-actin standard .
Corrected densitometric values for the three sets of in vitro-transcribed HIV-1 RNA are shown in Fig .
2A .
The expression of newly synthesized HIV-1 RNA in cells continuously exposed to TNF for 2 or 8 h paralleled the induction of NF- « B DNA-binding activity analyzed above ( Fig .
1 , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
As shown above , the EMSA PERSISTENT REPLICATION OF HIV-1 IN MONOCYTES REQUIRES NF- « B 2933 experiments revealed a clear diminution of NF-kB DNA-binding activity when TNF was removed after a 2-h pulse followed by a 6-h chase ( Fig .
1 ; compare lane 4 with lane 2 ) .
Nuclear run-on assays were performed to analyze the transcriptional status of HIV-1 genome expression during this transient TNF-induced NF- « B binding .
The rates of de novo LTR and pBru-2 subgenomic fragment transcription in TNF-pulsed U1 cells were reduced by 32 and 52 % , respectively , compared with those observed in controls continuously stimulated with TNF for 8 h. Figure 2A shows that ongoing HIV-1 transcription induced by a 2-h TNF exposure decreased during the chase period [ TNF ( 2 h/chase ( 6 h ) ] in contrast to its further increase when TNF was maintained in the culture medium [ TNF ( 8 h ) ] .
The ongoing HIV-1 transcription observed during the chase period was significantly higher than after a 2-h exposure to TNF , probably as a consequence of residual LTR transcriptional activity .
The apparent differences between RNA levels in pulse-chase experiments and in cells treated for 2 h alone for pBru-2 likely reflect experimental variability .
These experiments demonstrate the same trend as for the NF-kB DNA-binding activity observed in the nuclei ( Fig .
1 ) and were confirmed by the analysis of steady-state levels of total HIV-1 RNA by reverse transcription-PCR ( RT-PCR ) .
To maximize detection of total HIV-1 RNA , a modified PCR method using y-°°P-labeled specific oligonucleotide primers for amplification was used ; this procedure was followed by direct autoradiography of the gel-resolved products .
RT-PCR products of B-actin were used to normalize the amount of HIV-1 cDNA .
As expected from the induction of the HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity , increased amounts of total HIV-1 RNA were observed in cells continuously treated with TNF ( Fig .
2B ; compare lanes 3 and 5 with lane 1 ) .
Total HIV-1 RNA amounts observed during the chase period were clearly lower than those seen in 8-h TNF-treated control cells .
They were significantly higher than HIV-1 RNA levels in cells exposed for 2 h to TNF , as expected from the ongoing accumulation of viral RNAs from the residual LTR transcriptional activity .
Inhibition of constitutive NF- « B DNA-binding activity in chronically infected U937 cells is sufficient to reduce levels of steady-state HIV-1 RNA .
We established previously that chronic HIV-1 replication in the monocytic cell line U937 induces permanent nuclear translocation of NF-kB heterodimers ( pS50/p65 ) ( 5 ) .
Here , we determined whether inhibition of NF-kB DNA-binding activity could have functional effects on endogenous HIV-1 transcriptional activity , despite the production of the HIV-1 Tat protein , the transactivating function of which is clearly detected in these infected cultures ( 5 ) .
Signal-induced IxBa degradation , which leads to NF-kB activation , has been shown to be mediated by the proteolytic activity of the proteasome ( 13 , 46 , 55 , 63 ) .
To assess whether this HIV -induced activation of NF- « B was ultimately mediated by the proteasome through degradation or processing of NF-kB inhibitors , we treated HIV-1-infected U937 cells continuously with the peptide aldehyde Z-LLL-H , which specifically blocks the proteolytic activity of the proteasome ( 46 ) .
Control , uninfected U937 cells were treated for 2 h with increasing amounts of the peptide aldehyde and then stimulated with TNF for 10 min prior to cell extraction ( Fig .
3A , lanes 8 to 10 ) .
Treatment of uninfected U937 cells with either 1 or 10 wM Z-LLL-H reduced TNF-induced nuclear NF-kB complexes since the residual activity observed was 57 or 62.2 % , respectively ( lanes 9 and 10 ) , of that detected in untreated cells ( lane 8 ) .
In agreement with previous reports ( 7 , 10 , 30 , 40 , 60 ) , we observed that TNF-induced NF-kB DNA-binding activity paralleled the rapid degradation of IxBa and that pretreat-ment with compound Z-LLL-H blocked the TNF-induced deg- 2934 __ JACOUE ET AL .

Inhibition of permanent NF-kB activation by the peptide aldehyde Z-LLL-H paralleled the diminution of endogenous HIV-1 proviral transcription .
Infected U937 cells and uninfected controls were treated for 2 h with increasing amounts of Z-LLL-H , and the uninfected cells were exposed to TNF for the last 10 min .
Cells were then processed to obtain nuclear extracts and total RNA samples .
( A ) EMSA using extracts from infected cells ( > 30 days after infection ) ( lanes 1 to 4 ) and uninfected control cells ( lanes 5 to 10 ) with a [ y- `` °P ] JATP-labeled xB oligonucleotide .
Identically prepared nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells treated with Z-LLL-H ( lanes 5 to 7 ) were used to control the TNF-induced NF- « B DNA-binding activity ( lanes 8 to 10 ) .
Competition ( Comp ) was performed by adding a 40-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide to each sample prior to addition of the labeled probe ( lane 4 ) .
The residual NF- « B DNA-binding activity was determined by densitometric analysis of the autora-diogram obtained following overnight exposure , and values are given at the bottom .

Total and tat/revy HIV-1 RNA hybridization signals were recorded with a digital imaging system .
The densitometric values were corrected relative to the B-actin standards and expressed as a percentage of the residual HIV-1 transcription level in untreated cells .
These percentages of residual activity were plotted versus the various concentrations of Z-LLL-H .
The data shown are representative of five separate similar experiments .

The same treatment was applied to HIV-1l-infected cells .
Following a 2-h exposure of cells to Z-LLL-H , an inhibition of NF-kB DNA-binding activity was observed .
Indeed , infected cells treated with either 1 or 10 wM Z-LLL-H showed 58 or 41 % , respectively ( Fig .
3A , lanes 3 and 4 ) , of the amount of NF-kB DNA-binding activity detected in untreated cells ( lane 1 ) .
We next analyzed HIV-1 RNA steady-state levels in Z-LLL-H-treated U937-infected cells by the RT-PCR method J. ViroL .
described above ( Fig .
3B ) .
Figure 3B shows residual HIV-1 total and fat/rev transcription in Z-LLL-H-treated infected cells as a percentage of the level in untreated controls cells .
Levels of both HIV-1 total RNA and HIV-1 fat/rev RNA were reduced by the proteasome inhibitor , since levels of residual viral transcription were , respectively , 38.6 and 48 % ( 10 wM Z-LLL-H ) and 23 and 42 % ( 50 wM Z-LLL-H ) of the control levels .
These results show that the extent of NF- « B DNA-binding inhibition in Z-LLL-H-treated HIV-1-infected cells paralleled the decrease of integrated provirus transcription , which suggests that maintenance of high-level HIV-1 proviral transcription in U937 monocytic cells depends on the nuclear expression of NF- « xB .
Furthermore , the down-regulation of NF- « B DNA-binding activity in a Tat-expressing cell environment is sufficient to cause a drastic diminution of transcriptional activity of the integrated HIV-1 provirus .
The NF-KB response element in the viral enhancer is critical for the establishment of efficient HIV-1 replication in U937 cells .
To analyze directly the role of viral enhancer kB sequences in the establishment of HIV-1 replication , we monitored the fate of « < B-Mut virus in U937 cells ( Fig .
4A ) .
wt and HIV-1 constructs have been described previously ( 28 ) and differ only in a 5-bp substitution ( AAGGG to TITAA ) of the NF-kB response elements in both the 5 ' and 3 ' LTRs .
Kinetics of viral replication in U937 cells were monitored by detection of p24° `` ° production .
After the onset of wt virus infection , levels of p24°** production were similar to those observed in CEM cells infected with either wt or xB-Mut virus ( data not shown ) .
In clear contrast , xB-Mut viral replication was impaired in U937 cells , with 10*-fold less virus production than in U937 cells infected with wt virus .
To rule out the possibility that different infectivity potentials between the two viral preparations could account for their different replicative patterns , the amount of HIV-1 proviral DNA synthesized 2 h after virus-cell contact was examined by PCR using a primer pair specific for the R/US region , which should detect virtually all HIV-1 DNA synthesized ( Fig .
4B ) .
An oligonucleotide pair specific for the human B-actin gene was used to estimate the amount of cellular DNA in each sample .
Amounts of HIV-1 and B-actin DNAs in experimental samples were estimated by comparison with standards generated with known amounts of either cloned HIV-1 ; 4 ; DNA or U937 cellular DNA .
DNA levels were recorded with a digital imaging system , and values were estimated to be 30 and 11 proviral copies for cells infected with the wt and < B-Mut viruses , respectively .
The difference between DNA levels is less than the difference in the intensity of viral replication shown in Fig .
4A .
We tested whether the basal transcriptional capacity of both proviral constructs could have accounted for the replicative defect seen with the « B-Mut virus ( Fig .
5 ) .
This was assessed by transient transfection of U937 cells with the wt or xB-Mut proviral construct in order to analyze basal LTR transcriptional activity independently of viral entry and proviral inte-gration .
Total HIV-1 RNA was extracted 20 h after transfection and analyzed by RT-PCR .
Total HIV RNA signals , visualized by direct autoradiography of the dried gel , were recorded , and densitometric values ( in arbitrary units ) were normalized to values for the B-actin standard and plasmid DNA entry ( estimated 30 min after transfection by a modified Hirt technique ) .
The provirus was not less transcrip-tionally active in the U937 cell environment than its wt counterpart ( 26,383 and 8,943 arbitrary units of HIV-1 RNA syn-thesized , respectively ) .
Up-regulation of HIV-1 RNA synthesis was observed when wt- but not « B-Mut-transfected cells were exposed to TNF for 4 h , as expected for a provirus lacking the voL .

Establishment of HIV-1 replication in U937 cells is dependent on « B-responsive elements .
U937 cells were infected with viral supernatants produced after 50 days of culture of either wt or xB-Mut proviral DNA-electropo-rated CEM cells .
The data shown are representative of three similar studies .

In conclusion , the failure of < B-Mut provirus to achieve productive replication in U937 cells seems not to be a consequence of impaired transcriptional activity or a lower input of infectious particles .
Together , these results underlined the critical requirement of the enhancer kB motifs for full replication in monocytic U937 cells .
The proteasome-mediated regulation of NF-KB affects specifically B-dependent HIV-1 transcription in U937 cells .
To examine the specificity of the proteasome inhibitor on NF- « B activation in U937 cells , we measured its effects on the fate of steady-state HIV-1 RNA levels in wt- and < B-Mut-infected cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
Both cell populations were treated for 2 h with various amounts of the compound Z-LLL-H before harvesting of RNA .
When we analyzed HIV-1 RNAs by a classic RT-PCR experimental approach in < B-Mut-infected U937 cells , a very weak amplification was observed .
This finding was in agreement with the undetectable viral replication observed in these infected cells as measured by p24° `` antigen production .
To overcome this problem , we used a more sensitive nested PCR technique on the reverse-transcribed HIV-1 RNA .
RT-PCR products of B-actin were used to normalize the amount of PERSISTENT REPLICATION OF HIV-1 IN MONOCYTES REQUIRES NF- « B 2935 HIV-1 cDNA used as the template for the PCR .
As shown in Fig .
6B , a dose-dependent inhibition of total HIV-1 RNA levels was observed in extracts from wt-infected-cells treated with Z-LLL-H .
The total HIV-1 RNA signals visualized by direct autoradiography of dried gels ( Fig .
6A and B ) were quantified .
Densitometric values were expressed as percentages of the value for HIV-1 residual transcription in corresponding untreated controls ( Fig .
6C and D ) .
In Z-LLL-H-treated cells , residual HIV-1 transcription represented 30 % of the level in untreated cells ( Fig .
6D ) .
At this concentration of the inhibitor ( 50 M ) , we observed no effect on the amount of total HIV-1 RNA accumulated in the « < B-Mut-infected U937 population ( Fig .
6A and C ) .
The absence of effects of the proteasome inhibitor Z-LLL-H on the steady-state levels of total HIV-1 RNA produced by the xB-Mut virus suggests that enhancer-dependent transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR was mainly , if not solely , affected by this inhibitor .
Furthermore , Z-LLL-H treatment had no effect on the transcriptional regulation of a housekeeping gene , encoding B-actin , used as an internal control in our experiments .
This compound did not affect the levels of the Spl protein as measured by Western blot analysis ; the levels of p53 protein were also unaffected ( data not shown ) .
In conclusion , these observations and the fact that the proteasome inhibitor Z-LLL-H impaired specifically enhancer-dependent transcription of HIV-1 provirus provides further support for our hypothesis that permanent enhancer occupancy is needed for persistent HIV-1 replication in monocytic cells .
DISCUSSION We originally reported that NF- « B activation occurs upon chronic active HIV-1 replication in the U937 cell line , a monocytic cell system which expresses very little , if any , nuclear p50/p65 heterodimers ( 5 ) .
This intriguing phenomenon has since been confirmed studies of both U937 cells ( 47 ) and monocyte-derived normal blood macrophages ( 38 ) .

The peptide aldehyde Z-LLL-H inhibits specifically NF- « B-dependent HIV-1-transcription .
U937 cells were infected with virus derived from proviral DNA-transfected Cos-7 cells .
« B-Mut- and wt-infected U937 cells ( 26 days after infection ) were treated for 2 h with increasing amounts of the inhibitor Z-LLL-H. ( A ) RNA ( 10° cell equivalents ) extracted from these cells was subjected to primer extension and subsequent PCR with B-actin-specific primers as described above .
RT-PCR products of B-actin were used to normalized the amount of HIV-1 cDNA .
Nested PCR was performed for the detection of HIV-1 RNAs .
PCRs with uninfected cells and HIV-11 wj-infected cells ( 5 X 10° cell equivalents ) served as negative ( C- ) and positive ( C+ ) controls , respectively .
( B ) For each set of infected cells , total HIV-1 RNA densitometric values were expressed as percentages of the residual HIV-1 transcription in untreated cells .
These percentages were plotted against the various concentrations of the inhibitor Z-LLL-H. activities of HIV-1 enhancer-driven expression vectors , transiently transfected into chronically infected U937 cells , were found to be constitutively increased as a result of chronic infection , it was possible to postulate a role for NF-kB activation in the indefinite viral transcription and replication observed in this cell type .
Alternatively , however , it could be reasoned that HIV Tat protein , produced in a functional way in chronically HIV-1 ; U937 cells , is sufficient to perpetuate transcription of the integrated provirus , which would be merely initiated by NF-kB .
Indeed , addition of exogenous HIV Tat protein to U1 cells , a latently infected sub-clone of U937 cells , induces HIV-1 replication ( 1 , 11 , 17 ) .
In transient transfection assays , HIV Tat expression transacti-vates LTR-driven vectors independently of NF- « B DNA-binding elements .
However , numerous reports suggested that Tat , in addition to its capacity to elongate viral RNA through an interaction with the Tat-responsive element sequence , must somehow interact with multiprotein complexes associated with the HIV enhancer region and the primary initiation domain to exert its full transactivating effects on the viral LTR ( 9 , 28 , 36 , 37 , 48 , 61 ) .
Moreover , recent work from our laboratory shows that NF- « B-independent HIV Tat transactivation occurs in transformed lymphoblastoid T-cell lines but not in resting CD4 T lymphocytes purified from the peripheral blood ( 2 ) .
These notions prompted us to revisit the role of NF-kB activation in the long-term control of HIV-1 provirus transcription in cells of the monocytic lineage .
In the U1 cell system , it is well known that TNF stimulation activates NF- « B and increases the very low transcription levels of the two integrated provirus copies observed in unstimulated cells ( 18 , 24 , 50 , 51 ) .
Phorbol myristate acetate stimulation of U1 cells , acting through an autocrine secretion of TNF , results in a clear increase in dimeth-ylsulfate sensitivity of a guanine in the downstream enhancer repeat in LTR footprinting experiments that likely is due to the occupancy of the enhancer region ( 15 ) .
Indeed , a correlation between nuclear NF- « xB-binding activity and increased transcription was reported ( 15 , 51 ) .
From these experiments , however , it can not be excluded that TNF or phorbol myristate acetate induces , in addition to NF-kB , other molecular events which can participate in the control of HIV-1 genome transcription .
We have therefore used a method which allows specific termination of nuclear NF- « B function .
We recently reported ( 3 ) that TNF stimulation , when used as a transient pulse followed by washing of cells , first induces a nuclear translocation of p50/p65 NF- « B heterodimers and , through the lat-ter , the rapid de novo NF- « xB-dependent activation of IxBa gene transcription .
Newly transcribed IxBa protein translo-cates into nucleus , where it binds to NF-kB heterodimers and terminates their function in a highly specific manner ( 3 ) .
This does not happens if TNF is maintained in the culture medium , since permanent degradation of IxBa , including the newly synthesized molecules , occurs .
Using this approach , we have now compared the effects on NF- « B translocation and endogenous HIV-1 provirus transcription of prolonged ( 8-h ) or pulsed ( for 2 h , followed by 6 h in normal culture medium ) stimulation of U1 cells with recombinant TNF .
Whereas continuous TNF stimulation induced , as expected , a steady increase in nuclear NF- « B expression and HIV-1 transcription , a 2-h TNF pulse resulted in early activation of both NF-kB DNA binding and viral transcription , followed after a 6-h chase by the disappearance of nuclear NF-kB DNA-binding activity .
This phenomenon was accompanied by a brisk decrease of viral transcription to levels similar to those observed in 2-h TNF-stimulated U1 cells .
This result indicated that TNF-induced early NF- « B DNA binding to the HIV-1 enhancer is sufficient to launch HIV genome transcription but is , in addition , needed for persistent transcription .
This finding provided a first indication that ongoing transcription of integrated HIV-1 provirus depends strictly on actual occupancy of enhancer motifs by NF-kB heterodimers .
This interpretation is in agreement with the results of superinfection experiments ( 12 ) and in keeping with the notion that the lack of HIV-induced NF-kB activity may be one mechanism which restricts viral replication in U1 cells ( 12 , 52 ) .
Whereas the U1 cell system allowed us to test the role of p50/p65 heterodimers in early steps of HIV-1 reactivation , the chronically HIV-infected U937 cell model offered the opportunity to test the role of enhancer occupancy by NF- « B het- voL .
70 , 1996 erodimers in the intense transcriptional activity of integrated HIV-1 provirus in a fully permissive cell environment producing Tat protein on a permanent basis .
Partial blockade of this permanent NF- « B translocation induced by viral replication itself in this model system was obtained by inhibition of the proteolytic activity of the proteasome .
As early as 2 h after addition of the proteasome inhibitor Z-LLL-H , a dose-dependent inhibition of both nuclear binding activity and endogenous HIV transcription was observed .
This finding is a clear indication that viral replication activates NF- « B in U937 cells through a proteasome-dependent pathway and that the HIV-induced , constitutive NF- « B activation observed in the U937 cell line plays a major role in perpetuating HIV-1 genome transcription .
It should be stressed that no significant cell toxicity was induced by a 2-h Z-LLL-H treatment of U937 cells , whether infected or not , and that the levels of Sp1 and p53 proteins were not modified by such treatment ( results not shown ) .
Eliminating a role for p53 modifications in Z-LLL-H-treated cells was indeed important , since this molecule is also degraded in a ubiquitin proteasome-dependent manner in the presence of the human papillomavirus type 16 ( 42 ) .
The respective roles of NF-kB and HIV-Tat in HIV-1 transcription in chronically infected U937 cells are not entirely understood .
TNF stimulation of U937 cells was shown to induce the replication of Tat-defective virus to near wt levels in transient transfection assays and also to overcome the block of wt HIV replication induced by an inhibitor of Tat ( 37 ) .
We reported earlier that the activities of LTR-driven expression vectors deleted of NF-kB sequences and transiently transfected into chronically infected U937 cells are diminished 20-to 30-fold but are not abolished .
It is thus likely that NF-kB and Tat , bound to their respective DNA response elements on the LTR and the nascent transcripts of the integrated HIV provirus , collaborate as part of a large transcriptional protein complex to maintain the high-level viral expression observed in U937 cells .
Our present work suggests that NF-kB heterodimers represent a keystone in the building of such a multiprotein complex .
Our final evidence for the critical role of NF-kB in maintaining HIV-1 transcriptional activity was sought by infecting U937 cells with an HIV provirus carrying specific mutations in the 3 ' and 5 ' LTRs which abolish response to TNF and NF-kB DNA-binding activity .
The profound transcriptional defect shown by this construct confirmed that the HIV-1 enhancer must bind NF-kB heterodimers for active viral replication to occur in U937 cells .
Inhibition of proteasome activity suppressed the transcription of the wt provirus but not that of its mutated counterpart , providing further evidence for the specificity of the inhibitor used .
Our results are consistent with a report showing that a kB-defective simian immunodeficiency virus construct is unable to replicate in primary macrophages ( 8 ) .
Thus , a strategy of self-perpetuation of proviral genome transcription through NF- « B activation appears to be used by HIV-1 in the monocytic lineage .
The ability of HIV-1 to induce permissiveness to its own replication in cells of the monocytic lineage may underlie the indefinite and intense production of viral particles observed in infected patients .
