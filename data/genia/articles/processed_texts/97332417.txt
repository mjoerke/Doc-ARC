The functional analysis of the IL-8 gene revealed that both AP-1-and NF-B factor-binding elements were involved in conferring the responsiveness to CMV .
Moreover , electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that CMV induced the formation of and AP-1 complexes .
These results suggest that CMV activates these transcriptional factors , resulting in IL-8 gene expression .
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus infecting 50 to 90 % of normal adults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals ( 1 ) .
The progression of CMV infection is related to a complex interrelation of virus replication with the host immune system , including soluble and cellular factors .
Evidence is accumulating that a chemotactic cytokine ( chemokine ) , interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) , is essentially involved in neutrophil-mediated tissue injury ( 5 , 13 , 19 ) .
IL-8 enhanced the production of infectious virions and the replication of CMV in human embryonic lung fibroblasts , and CMV selectively induced IL-8 receptor type A ( CXCR1 ) transcript in the same cells ( 14 ) .
Although mono-cytes/macrophages are the predominant type of cells harboring CMV ( 2 ) and can produce large amounts of IL-8 in response to various stimuli ( 6 ) , it remains to be investigated whether CMV infection can induce IL-8 production in human mono-cytes/macrophages .
Hence , we examined the effects of CMV infection on IL-8 production , using a human monocytic cell line , THP-1 ( 24 ) , in which infection is aborted at the stage of CMV immediate-early ( IE ) gene expression ( 17 , 20 ) .
The Towne strain of CMV ( 4 ) was propagated on human embryonal lung fibroblast cells , MRC-5 ( 8 ) , and was titrated by a standard plaque assay as previously described ( 26 ) .
In some experiments , CMV was irradiated with UV light ( 100 V , 15 W ) for 10 min at a distance of 10 em .
A human monocytic cell line , THP-1 ( 24 ) , was infected with the Towne strain of CMV at the indicated multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) and was cultured thereafter for the times indicated ( see Fig .
1 ) .
IL-8 levels in the culture supernatants were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for human IL-8 ( 11 ) .
Ten micrograms of total cellular RNA extracted from infected THP-1 cells was processed for Northern blotting by using radiolabeled * Corresponding author .

5692 human IL-8 or B-actin cDNA as a probe as previously described ( 27 ) .
Deleted -flanking regions of the IL-8 gene were subcloned into a firefly luciferase expression vector ( 6 , 16 ) .
Site-directed mutagenesis of the IL-8 AP-1 , NF-IL-6 , and « B-like sites in the -133-luciferase plasmid was carried out as previously described ( 15 ) .
Two million THP cells were transfected with 10 ug of plasmid DNA by the DEAE-dextran method ( 16 ) .
Transfected cells were then divided into two portions and incubated for 24 h at a density of 4 X 10° cells/ml .
Thereafter , the cells were further cultured with or without CMV ( MOI , 1 ) or lipo-polysaccharide ( LPS ) ( Escherichia coli 055 B5 LPS ; Difco Lab-oratories , Detroit , Mich. ) for 24 h. After protein concentrations were determined with a protein assay kit ( Pierce , Rockford , III . )
using bovine serum albumin as a standard , luciferase activities in 10 pug of cell lysates were determined with a Pica Gene kit ( Toyo Ink Inc. , Tokyo , Japan ) and a Lumat ( Berthold , Germany ) model LB950 luminometer .
Nuclear proteins were extracted from THP-1 cells infected with CMV ( MOL , 1 ) for 3 h according to the method described by Dignam et al .
( 3 ) .
Four micrograms of proteins was processed for electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) using the AP-1-binding site ( -130 to =-116 bp ; GTGATGACTCA GGT ) or xB-binding site ( -83 to -68 bp ; CGTGGAATTTC CTCTG ) of the IL-8 gene as previously described ( 6 , 12 , 16 ) .
In some experiments , nuclear proteins were preincubated with either a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligomers or 1 pl of 10-fold-diluted rabbit antisera against human c-Rel ( 22 ) , p65 , p50 , and RelB ( 18 ) before being loaded onto a gel .
CMV infection induced THP-1 cells to secrete IL-8 protein within 1 day , and the protein level reached a plateau on days 3 to 5 ( Fig .
1A ) .
The analysis of the time soon after infection demonstrated that IL-8 secretion started between 3 to 6 h after the infection ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , UV-irradiated CMV or virus-free filtrates of CMV-infected MRC-5 cell culture supernatants induced only a marginal level of IL-8 secretion until 7 days postinfection ( Fig .
1A ) .

( A ) Kinetics of IL-8 production by THP-1 cells .
THP-1 cells ( 10° cells/2 ml ) were infected with CMV at an MOI of 1 ( CMV ) or an equivalent amount of UV-irradiated CMV ( UV-CMV ) , were mock infected ( Mock ) , or were stimulated with virus-free CMV-infected MRC-5 cell culture supernatants ( Filtrated-CMV ) or LPS ( 100 ng/m ! )
( LPS ) .
Culture supernatants were collected at the indicated times , and IL-8 content of the supernatants ( IL-8 conc . )
was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
Data are expressed as means + standard errors ( error bars ) calculated from three independent experiments .
( B ) Northern blots of total RNA extracted from CMV-infected THP-1 cells .
Total RNAs were extracted from THP-1 cells at 6 h ( lanes 1 , 4 , and 7 ) , 12 h ( lanes 2 , 5 , and 8 ) , and 48 h ( lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 ) after mock infection ( lanes 1 to 3 ) , LPS ( 100 ng/m ! )
stimulation ( lanes 4 to 6 ) , or CMV ( MOL , 1 ) infection ( lanes 7 to 9 ) .
Northern blotting was performed as described in the text .
production from THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that the infectious virus is required for IL-8 production .
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( MNC ) also produced threefold more IL-8 NOTES - 5693 at 5 days after CMV infection than did mock-infected cells ( CMV-infected cells , 33 + 3.8 ng/ml ; mock-infected cells , 10 + 1.8 ng/ml [ means + standard errors ] ) .
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that CMV infection but not mock infection induced IL-8 mRNA expression in THP-1 cells from 6 to 48 h after infection ( Fig .
1B ) .
An analysis of the time soon after infection showed that IL-8 mRNA expression started rapidly , within 0.5 h after infection ( data not shown ) .
CMV as well as LPS greatly increased the luciferase activity in THP-1 cells transfected with -546 or -133-luciferase vectors ( Fig .
2 ) .
However , LPS but not CMV infection significantly increased the luciferase activities in cells transfected with -98-luciferase vector .
These results suggest that the minimally essential elements for IL-8 gene regulation by CMV infection are present in the 5 ' region spanning downstream from -133 bp .
This region contains three cis elements , AP-1 ( -126 to -120 bp ) , NF-IL-6-like ( -94 to =-81 bp ) , and kB-like ( -80 to =70 bp ) sites , which contribute to IL-8 gene transcription in differential manners in different types of cells ( 6 , 12 , 16 , 27 ) .
The mutation of either the AP-1 site or the « B-like site markedly reduced the increase in the luciferase activity , whereas mutation of the NF-IL-6-like site only marginally decreased the inducibility ( Fig .
2 ) .
These results demonstrated that both AP-1- and NF- « xB-binding sites were involved in CMV-induced IL-8 gene activation .
Nuclear proteins from mock-transfected cells gave rise to a faint band when the NF-kB-binding site was used as a probe , and CMV infection enhanced the complex formation markedly ( Fig .
3A ) .
The complex formation was inhibited by a corresponding oligomer but not an unrelated oligomer ( Fig .
3A ) , and the antisera to p65 , p50 , and c-Rel but not that to RelB supershifted the complexes ( Fig .
3B ) .
These results indicated that the induced complexes were composed of p65 , p50 , and c-Rel as observed on complexes in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells ( 6 ) .
In addition , CMV infection also enhanced the AP-1 complex formation better than mock infection did , and the AP-1 complexes were inhibited by a specific primer but not by an unrelated primer ( Fig .
3C ) .
The antisera to c-Fos and to Jun-D diminished and supershifted the complexes , respec-tively , whereas the complex formation was not affected by the +133 ( NF-KB site mutated ) -lue a -133 ( NF-IL-6 site mutated ) -luc Z +133 ( AP-1 site mutated ) -luc E L LPs C cmy B Mock -luc i ~133-lue I ?

EMSA with nuclear proteins extracted from CMV-infected THP-1 cells .
( A ) Characterization of nuclear proteins bound to « B-binding site of the IL-8 gene .
Nuclear proteins were extracted from THP-1 cells at 3 h after mock ( lanes 1 to 3 ) or CMV ( lanes 4 to 6 ) infection .
EMSA was performed on nuclear extracts preincubated with no reagents ( lanes 1 and 4 ) , an NF- « B oligomer ( lanes 2 and 5 ) , or an AP-1 probe ( lanes 3 and 6 ) , and the « B-binding site of the IL-8 gene was used as a labeled probe as described in the text .
( B ) Further characterization of nuclear proteins bound to « B-binding site of the IL-8 gene .
Nuclear proteins were extracted from THP-1 cells at 3 h after mock ( lane 1 ) , or CMV ( lanes 2 to 7 ) infection .
EMSA was performed on nuclear proteins preincubated with no reagents ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , NF- « B oligomer ( lane 3 ) , or anti-p65 ( lane 4 ) , anti-p50 ( lane 5 ) , anti-c-Rel ( lane 6 ) , or anti-ReIB ( lane 7 ) antiserum , and the « B-binding site of the IL-8 gene was used as a labeled probe .
( C ) Characterization of nuclear proteins bound to AP-1-binding site in the IL-8 gene .
Nuclear proteins were extracted from THP-1 cells at 3 h after mock ( lanes 2 to 4 ) or CMV ( lanes 5 to 7 ) infection .
EMSA was performed on nuclear proteins preincubated with no reagents ( lanes 2 and 5 ) , an AP-1 probe ( lanes 3 and 6 ) , or an NF- « B probe ( lanes 4 and 7 ) , and the AP-1-binding site of the IL-8 gene was used as a labeled probe .
The labeled DNA fragment without nuclear proteins was run in lane 1. antisera to c-Jun and Jun-B ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that CMV infection induced a specific AP-1 complex composed mainly of c-Fos and Jun-D. We demonstrated in this study that infectious CMV but not UV-irradiated CMV induced a human monocytic cell line , THP-1 , and peripheral blood MNC to produce IL-8 .
We further showed that CMV infection caused IL-8 gene transcription in THP-1 cells .
IL-8 production as well as gene transcription can be augmented by several soluble mediators , including J. ViRoL .
IL-1 , tumor necrosis factor alpha , and gamma interferon ( gam-ma IFN ) ( 27 ) .
Although CMV could induce IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor alpha production ( 25 ) , the virus-free CMV-infected supernatants failed to induce IL-8 production by THP-1 cells .
Thus , it is unlikely that CMV infection enhanced IL-8 production indirectly by inducing the production of these soluble factors .
CMV infection increases the synthesis of host DNA , RNA , and protein ( 21 , 23 ) , and CMV-infected cells show an initial decrease in protein synthesis , followed by its significant increase .
In contrast , UV-irradiated virus causes an initial decrease in protein synthesis without its subsequent increase .
Hence , stimulation of host cell protein synthesis by CMV at the later phase appears to require the synthesis of a virally encoded protein ( s ) .
Thus , the failure of UV-irradiated CMV to induce IL-8 production suggests that CMV caused IL-8 production by de novo synthesis of a virally encoded protein ( s ) .
Accumulating evidence indicates that CMV infection arrests at the stage of the IE gene expression in monocytic cells including THP-1 cells ( 17 , 20 , 25 ) .
The transcription of IL-1B was significantly enhanced by the transfection with the IE1 gene but not the IE2 gene of CMV ( 7 ) , whereas that of an IL-1-related cytokine , IL-1 receptor antagonist , was enhanced by the transfection with the IE2 gene but not the IE1 gene ( 10 ) .
It remains to be investigated whether these IE gene products are involved in IL-8 gene expression .
The activation of NF- « B but neither AP-1 nor NF-IL-6 was indispensable for LPS-induced IL-8 gene transcription in THP cells ( 6 ) .
However , our present results demonstrate that the activation of AP-1 and NF- « B but not that of NF-IL-6 was indispensable for CMV-induced IL-8 gene transcription , suggesting that the molecular mechanism involved in IL-8 gene transcription differed , even within the same cell , depending on the employed stimuli .
We demonstrated that IL-8 enhanced CMV replication in lung fibroblasts and that CMV infection induced IL-8 receptor expression on these cells ( 14 ) .
These results suggest that CMV infection induces inflammatory reactions through interacting with IL-8 and its receptors .
We further demonstrated here that CMV infection induced in vitro IL-8 production by peripheral blood MNC as well as THP-1 cells .
Since infectious CMV induced in vitro IL-8 production by additional types of human cells , including lung fibroblasts and astrocytoma cells ( our unpublished data ) , it is probable that , even in vivo , CMV induces various types of cells to produce IL-8 .
The reactivation of persistent or latent infection causes overt CMV infection in AIDS patients and immunocompromised recipients of organ transplants ( 1 , 15 ) .
CMV infection in vitro induced a rapid production of massive amounts of IL-8 .
We observed that IL-8 enhanced in vitro CMV replication in lung fibroblasts ( 14 ) and that IL-8 in vitro antagonized the antiviral activity of IFN and enhanced picornavirus replication through reducing both virus-induced and constitutive 2 , 5 A-synthetase activities ( 9 ) .
Thus , IL-8 produced upon CMV infection may aggravate CMV infection by enhancing virus replication and counteracting the antiviral activities of IFN .
In such cases , IL-8 might be a novel target for intervention therapy for opportunistic CMV infection and CMV-associated diseases .
