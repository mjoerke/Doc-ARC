Integrin-mediated Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Cytokine Message Induction in Monocytic Cells A POSSIBLE SIGNALING ROLE FOR THE Syk TYROSINE KINASE* ( Received for publication , January 31 , 1995 , and in revised form , March 16 , 1995 ) Tsung H.

Julianot** From the { Department of Pharmacology , the §Department of Microbiology and Immunology , and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , School of Medicine , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 , and the Department of Molecular Biology , The Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute , Princeton , New Jersey 08543 Activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases is an important aspect of signal transduction mediated by integrins .
In the human monocytic cell line THP-1 , either integrin-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin or ligation of B1 integrins with antibodies causes a rapid and intense tyrosine phosphorylation of two sets of proteins of about 65-75 and 120-125 kDa .
In addition , integrin ligation leads to nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-KB transcription factor , to activation of a reporter gene driven by a promoter containing NF- « B sites , and to increased levels of mRNAs for immediate-early genes , including the cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -1 $ .
The tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A block both integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and increases in IL-1B message levels , indicating a causal relationship between the two events .
The components tyrosine phosphorylated subsequent to cell adhesion include paxillin , pp125 `` * `` , and the SH2 domain containing tyrosine kinase Syk .
In contrast , integrin ligation with antibodies induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk but not of FAK or paxillin .
In adhering cells , pre-treatment with cytochalasin D suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin but not of Syk , while IL-16 message induction is unaffected .
These observations indicate that the Syk tyrosine kinase may be an important component of an integrin signaling pathway in monocytic cells , leading to activation of and to increased levels of cytokine messages .
Members of the integrin family of cell surface receptors are involved in many key biological processes , including cell to cell and cell to extracellular matrix adhesion , cell motility , hemo-stasis , lymphocyte trafficking , and inflammatory phenomena ( 1-3 ) .
Integrins are comprised of noncovalently linked a/f het-erodimers ( 4 ) .
Different a and B subunits can associate in various combinations , which then determine the ligand-bind-ing specificities of the intact integrin heterodimer complexes ( 2 , 4 ) .
Recently , it has become apparent that integrins function not only as adhesive proteins but can also transduce biochemical signals into the interior of the cell ( 5 ) .

In fibroblasts , platelets , endothelial cells , and cultured tumor cells , integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation involves a novel cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase termed pp125 focal adhesion kinase ( pp125 `` *4* ) ' ( 6-8 ) .
However , other aspects of integrin signaling have been observed , including calcium transients ( 9 ) , changes in cytoplasmic pH ( 10 ) , modulation of ion channels ( 11 ) , activation of protein kinase C ( 12 ) , as well as numerous other effects ( 13 ) .
The relationship between these later events and integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphory !
-ation is currently unclear .
There have been observations in a variety of cell types showing that interactions with the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) can modulate gene expression ( 14-17 ) .
During inflammation , blood monocytes respond to chemotactic factors and subsequently extravasate into inflamed tissues .
Monocytes migrate through the subendothelial basement membrane and underlying inter-stitial structures rich in extracellular matrix proteins and also interact with vascular endothelial cells and connective tissue cells .
Partly as a consequence of cell-cell and cell-ECM inter-actions , monocytes are induced to secrete cytokines and to undergo maturation to macrophages .
Integrins are prominent among the cell surface receptors that mediate many of the adhesive functions of monocytes ( 1 , 2 ) .
In human peripheral blood monocytes , cell adherence to ECM components or ligation of B1 integrins with antibodies results in the rapid induction of multiple inflammatory mediator genes including several cytokines ( 18-20 ) .
The 5'-regulatory regions of many of the genes induced by integrin ligation contain binding motifs for the NF- « B transcription factor , suggesting a role for this factor in the gene induction process ( 5 ) .
In parallel to gene induction , a rapid and profound increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation is observed , with the predominant phosphorylated compo-nent ( s ) having a molecular mass of about 76 kDa ( 21 ) .
Both of these responses are blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors , suggesting an important role for protein tyrosine phosphorylation in integrin signaling pathways , leading to inflammatory mediator gene induction .
Aside from enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation , little is known of integrin-mediated signal transduction in monocytic cells .
A significant reason for this is the difficulty involved in performing biochemical or molecular studies on peripheral blood monocytes as well as the donor to donor variability observed with these cells .

16189 16190 In this report , we describe a cell culture model using the human monocytic leukemia cell line , THP-1 , which mimics important aspects of monocyte responses to ECM proteins .
THP-1 cell adhesion to ECM proteins or ligation of B1 integrins with antibody induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation , increases inflammatory mediator gene message levels , and activates the NF-kB transcription factor .
These responses are blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as herbimycin A and genistein .
Among the proteins tyrosine phosphorylated in THP-1 cells in response to cell adhesion to ECM components are the pp125 `` * `` ( 6 , 22 ) , the focal contact protein paxillin ( 23 ) , and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk ( 24 , 25 ) .
Ligation of B1 integrins with intact antibodies or with F ( ab ' ) , ; fragments results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk but not of FAK or paxillin .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk is accompanied by an increase in its kinase activity .
These results indicate that , like FAK , the Syk kinase is an integrin-responsive nonreceptor tyrosine kinase .
They also suggest that activation of Syk is closely correlated with the induction of inflammatory mediator gene messages , while there is no such correlation for FAK .
Thus , Syk may be a vital part of an integrin signaling pathway in monocytic cells , leading to transcription factor activation , and to increased levels of cytokine messages .

RESULTS THP-1 Cells Adhere to ECM Components via Integrins-We surveyed the expression of integrins on the THP-1 cell surface by flow cytometry .
THP-1 cells maintained in suspension culture expressed several integrin subunits including B1 , B2 , « 2 , « 3 , « 4 , and « 5 ( data not shown ) .
We also examined whether these cells could adhere to ECM component-coated substrata .
As shown in Fig .
14A , THP-1 cells adhered to tissue culture plates coated with fibronectin , laminin , collagen type I , or collagen type IV .
THP-1 cells exhibited the highest level of cell adhesion to the fibronectin substratum , a moderate level of adherence to laminin , and lower levels of cell adhesion to collagen type I or collagen type IV , while only a few cells adhered to albumin-coated control wells .
To test whether cell adhesion to fibronectin was specifically mediated by integrins , THP-1 cells were treated with RGDS peptide or with a mouse antibody recognizing the B1 integrin subunit .
Fig .
1B shows that both RGDS peptide and anti-B1 integrin antibody inhibited cell adhesion to fibronectin , whereas treatment with RGES peptide or normal mouse IgG had no effect .
These results indicate that THP-1 cells use B1 integrins to interact with and adhere to ECM components such as fibronectin .
Engagement of THP-1 Cell Integrins Increases Protein Tyrosine Phosphorylation and IL-1B Message Levels-THP-1 cells were plated on fibronectin-coated dishes for different periods of time ( 7.5-60 min ) .
Lysates from adherent cells were examined for protein phosphorylation on tyrosine residues by using anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting .
As shown in Fig .
24 ( top panel ) , cell adhesion to fibronectin gave rise to a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins , including three broad bands centered around 67 , 71 , and 120 kDa .
The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was readily detected 7.5 min after cells were plated on to the fibronectin substratum , reached a maximal level after 15 min , and then declined , but was still significantly elevated after 1 h.

Activation of NF- « B by integrin ligation .
THP-1 cells were transfected with an NF-kB-driven CAT reporter plasmid ( panels A and B ) or a c-fos-driven luciferase reporter plasmid ( panel A ) .
24 h after transfection , cells ( 3 X 10° ) were resuspended in 1 % BSA in RPMI medium and left in suspension or plated on fibronectin-coated 60-mm dishes .
NF- « B-transfected cells were also stimulated with 5 ug/ml anti-Bl integrin TS2/16 mAb IgG or TS2/16 F ( ab ' ) , fragments followed by F ( ab ' ) , goat anti-mouse Ab for 60 min at 4 °C and then incubated at 37 °C ( panel B ) .
Cells were collected 24 h later and lysed to measure CAT activity or 6 h later for luciferase activity .
c-fos-transfected cells were also stimulated with 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , and luciferase activity was measured 6 h later .
In A , solid bars represent non-adherent cells , hatched bars represent cells adhered to Fn , stippled bars represent cells treated with phorbol ester .
Data are +8.E .
Panel C depicts the results of gel shift assays using a probe containing NF-kB motifs from the class I MHC enhancer ; the experimental conditions are the same as Panels A and B .
The identification of the NF-kB p50/p65 heterodimer was confirmed by supershifting the p65 band and blocking the p50 band with specific antibodies ( 32 , 33 ) .
The faster moving band was similarly identified as p50/p50 homodimer .
Cells were analyzed after 1 h ( lanes 1-5 ) or after overnight stimulation ( lanes 6-10 ) under the following conditions .
Lanes 1 and 6 , adherence to Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Cytokine Message Induction matory mediator gene IL-1 $ B .
Fig .
24 ( middle panel ) shows that maximal induction of IL-1B message was reached 1 h after cell adhesion to fibronectin began .
By comparing the time courses , it can be seen that the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation occurred prior to IL-1B message expression .
The adhesion-induced increase in IL-1B message over basal levels was approximately 4-5-fold .
We have observed that certain other cytokine messages ( e.g .
IL-8 ) are also increased upon THP-1 adhesion to fibronectin ( data not shown ) .
Antibody-mediated ligation of integrins has been previously used to mimic the integrin clustering process that occurs during formation of adhesive contacts ( 35 ) .
Nonadherent THP-1 cells were treated with the anti-B1 integrin antibody TS2/16 and then analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation and message levels .
As shown in Fig .
2B ( top panel ) , ligation of B1 integrins resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation ( lane 3 ) , although the pattern was somewhat different from that induced by cell adhesion to fibronectin ( lane 2 ) .
With antibody ligation , bands at about 115 and 67 kDa were most prominent .
Ligation of B1 integrins with antibody could also increase IL-1B message levels ( Fig .
2B , middle panel , lane 3 ) .
The observed induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and message expression by anti-Bl antibody was not due to engagement of Fc receptors , since TS2/16 F ( ab ' ) , induced tyrosine phosphorylation and IL-1B message as effectively as intact antibody ( Fig .
2C ) .
Integrin Ligation Leads to Activation of NF- « B-To determine whether integrin ligation might lead to activation of transcription factors and the initiation of transcription , we employed gel mobility shift assays , as well as reporter gene assays .
Since the IL-1 promoter , as well as the promoters for several other monocyte immediate-early genes , contains NF-kB motifs ( 5 ) , we decided to focus on activation of the NF-kB transcription complex .
THP-1 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing several copies of the NF-kB motif driving a CAT reporter gene , by a similar plasmid with mutated NF-kB sites , or by a luciferase reporter construct driven by the c-fos promoter .
As seen in Fig .
3A , THP cell adhesion to fibronectin resulted in a substantial induction of CAT activity in cells transfected with the construct containing NF- « B motifs but not in cells transfected with the mutated NF-kB construct .
Expression of luciferase driven by the c-fos promoter was not affected by cell adhesion , indicating that the results observed with the NF- « B-driven vector were not due to generalized increases in transcriptional activity .
As seen in Fig .
3B , activation of the NF- « B-driven reporter could be triggered by integrin ligation with intact anti-B1 antibody or with F ( ab ' ) , fragments of the antibody , suggesting that integrin ligation , rather than cell adhesion , was sufficient for reporter activation .
Integrin ligation by antibodies or integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin also caused activation and nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-kB complex .
As seen in Fig .
3C , using a probe containing the MHC class I enhancer NF-KB site , within 1 h there was a strong increase in bands representing p50 and p65 complexes ; an even more robust effect was observed after overnight stimulation .
Use of a probe containing the IL-16 NF-kB motif gave similar results ( data not shown ) .
These observations , along with the reporter gene assays , suggest that integrin ligation can activate NF-kB , allowing this factor to contribute to the stimulation of tran fibronectin ; lanes 2 and 7 , no stimulation ( controls ) ; lanes 3 and 8 , TS2/16 antibody ; lanes 4 and 9 , TS2/16 F ( ab ' ) , fragments ; lanes 5 and 10 , TS2/16 F ( ab ' ) , followed by goat anti-mouse second antibody .
Individual components were identified by interference with the mobility of p50 and p65 ; lane 11 is the same as lane 10 but is pretreated with anti-p65 ; lane 12 , pretreated with anti-p50 ; lane 13 , pretreated with anti-c-rel .

Herbimycin A and Genistein Inhibit Tyrosine Phosphorylation and IL-1B Message Expression Induced by Cell Adhesion or by Ligation of B1 Integrins-To evaluate whether tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in the signaling pathways leading to increased message levels , THP-1 cells were treated with protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and examined for effects on tyrosine phosphorylation and IL-16 message induction .
Herbimycin A and genistein are selective inhibitors of tyrosine kinases with distinct mechanisms of action ; herbimycin A blocks tyrosine kinases by attacking critical sulfhydryl groups ( 36 ) , while genistein inhibits these enzymes by binding to the ATP binding sites ( 37 ) .
Fig .
44 ( top panel ) demonstrates that treatment of THP-1 cells with herbimycin A resulted in an inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by cell adhesion to fibronectin .
The inhibition was dose dependent ; 10 um herbimycin A strongly suppressed the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation , while 2 um was less effective .
Expression of IL-16 mRNA was inhibited by herbimycin A in a manner similar to the effect on tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
44 , middle panel ) .
Another tyrosine kinase inhibitor , genistein , also exhibited similar inhibitory effects on tyrosine phosphorylation and IL-16 expression ( Fig .
4B ) ; the inhibitory effects of genistein were noticeable at 20 um and virtually complete at 100 un .
As in the case of adherence-induced events , the responses induced by anti-B1 antibody could be blocked with herbimycin A or genistein .
As shown in Fig .
4C , TS2/16-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and IL-1B expression were also inhibited by herbimycin A or genistein in a dose-dependent manner .
Thus , the responses induced by integrin ligation or by adhesion could be inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A or genistein , suggesting that integrin-mediated increases in IL-1B 16194 TS2/16 NAD Fn 1gG F ( ab ) We wn « s Syk autophosphorylation ears .

Identification of Proteins Tyrosine Phosphorylated in Response to Cell Adhesion to a Fibronectin Substratum or to Ligation of B1 Integrins with Antibodies-We sought to identify proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated in THP-1 cells subsequent to engagement of integrins , which might be important in integrin-mediated message induction .
We obtained antibodies to several proteins known to be involved in signal transduction cascades or in cytoskeletal organization and examined their tyrosine phosphorylation status .
We examined FAK ( 125 kDa ) as a possible component of the 120-kDa complex and Raf-1 ( 74 kDa ) , PTP1D ( 72 kDa ) , paxillin ( 68 kDa ) , and Syk kinase ( 72 kDa ) as possible components of the 65 kDa-75-kDa complexes .
Specific antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate these potential substrates , followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody .
As shown in Fig .
5A , it is clear that FAK , paxillin , and Syk kinase were tyrosine phosphorylated upon cell adhesion to fibronectin ; there was no evidence for tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1D or Raf .
Only Syk kinase , but not FAK or paxillin , was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated when cells were stimulated by treatment with anti-Bl integrin antibody .

Effect of cytochalasin D on tyrosine phosphorylation and IL-1 induction .
A , THP-1 cells were allowed to adhere and spread on fibronectin-coated dishes in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of cytochalasin D ( 0.5 uM ) at 37 °C for 30 min before being photographed at 300 % magnification .
B , cells were incubated nonadherently or plated on to fibronectin-coated dishes in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of 0.5 M cytochalasin D for 30 min at 37 °C .
Following the incubations , cell lysates were immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with antibodies as indicated in the figure .
The precipitated immunocomplexes were analyzed for phos-photyrosyl-containing proteins by anti-phosphotyrosine ( anti-PY¥ ) immunoblotting .
The blots were stripped and reprobed with the respective antibody used for immunoprecipitation .

NAD , nonadherent ; ADH , adherent to fibronectin .
Syk kinase was not due to engagement of Fc receptors , since the F ( ab ' ) , fragment of TS2/16 was also effective ( Fig .
5B ) .
Thus , increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk occurs during integrin-mediated cell adhesion or subsequent to integrin ligation by antibodies .
Immunodepletion experiments revealed that Syk , paxillin , and FAK contribute to the overall patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation observed in response to adhesion or integrin ligation with antibody , but they do not fully account for the patterns ( data not shown ) ; thus , additional unidentified proteins are also tyrosine phosphorylated in response to integrin ligation .
Activation of Syk Kinase by Engagement of Integrins-Fol-lowing stimulation of the cells through integrins , there were significant increases in the activity of the Syk kinase , as indicated by immunocomplex kinase assays ( Fig .
6 ) .
In nonadherent THP-1 cells , there was detectable kinase activity , but the activity increased 4- , 3.5- , and 3-fold , respectively , upon cell adhesion to a fibronectin substratum , ligation of B1 integrins with TS2/16 , or with TS2/16 F ( ab ' ) ; ; the radioactivity in each band was quantitated using a PhosphorImager .
As shown in Fig .
7 , herbimycin A and genistein suppressed the kinase activity of Syk .
The concentrations of inhibitors required to block Syk activation were similar to those required to inhibit the overall pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation and the induction of Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Cytokine Message Induction IL-18 message .
Thus , in monocytic cells , Syk is an integrin-responsive tyrosine kinase whose activation parallels , and may impinge on , the induction of cytokine messages .
Role of the Cytoskeleton-We have explored the role of the cytoskeleton in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and IL-1 message expression by use of the drug cytochalasin D , an inhibitor of actin filament assembly ( 38 ) .
As seen in Fig .
84 , treatment with cytochalasin D inhibits spreading of THP-1 cells on fibronectin but does not affect adhesion .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK , and particularly of paxillin , that is induced in THP-1 cells by interaction with a fibronectin substratum is strongly inhibited by cytochalasin D ( Fig .
8B ) .
This suggests that some degree of microfilament assembly is required for these phosphorylation events .
By contrast , adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk is not blocked by cytochalasin D treatment ; likewise , IL-18 message induction is not affected .
These observations clearly distinguish between presumptive integrin signaling events that require actin filament assembly and events such as Syk activation that do not have this requirement .
They also indicate that extensive cytoskeletal reorganization is not required for integrin-mediated increases in IL-1B message levels .
DISCUSSION Ligation of B1 integrins in peripheral blood monocytes results in a prompt and robust induction of a number of inflammatory mediator genes including IL-1 , IL-8 , IL-6 , and tumor necrosis factor , as well as genes for a number of transcription factors ( 18-20 ) .
Recently , we have demonstrated that B1 integrin ligation in monocytes also results in a burst of tyrosine phosphorylation and that this is necessary for subsequent integrin-mediated gene induction ( 21 ) .
Here , we have shown that similar events , including integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and increases in inflammatory gene message levels , also occur in THP-1 cells , a monocytic cell line that is more amenable to study of biochemical and molecular events than are primary monocytes .
We also show that the transcription factor NF- « B is activated in response to integrin ligation .
Fur-ther , we have identified some of the proteins that are tyrosine phosphorylated in THP-1 cells subsequent to integrin ligation ; these include the focal contact protein paxillin and the FAK and Syk non-receptor tyrosine kinases .
The patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation induced in THP-1 cells by integrin-mediated cell adhesion or by antibody ligation of B1 integrins are similar but distinct .
Both types of stimuli result in prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of several components in the 65-75- and the 115-125-kDa ranges .
However , as observed in whole cell lysates , integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin produces a strong doublet at 65-75 kDa , while antibody ligation results primarily in phosphorylation of the lower molecular mass component of the doublet ; likewise , among the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at 115-125 kDa , adhesion results in strong phosphorylation of a slowly migrating component ( 120 kDa ) , while antibody ligation primarily affects a more rapidly migrating component ( 115 kDa ) .
The basis for the differences in tyrosine phosphorylation patterns in THP-1 cells stimulated by anti-integrin antibodies and those stimulated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion is unclear at this time .
One reasonable possibility is that cell adhesion results in a more complete engagement of the cytoskeleton than does the formation of integrin dimers or multimers triggered by antibodies and the degree of cytoskeletal organization can affect the recruitment of proteins subject to tyrosine phosphorylation .
Despite differences in the overall patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by cell adhesion or by antibody ligation of integrins , it is clear that both of these stimuli can activate NF-kB and can give rise to increased levels of cytokine mes 16195 sages .
Furthermore , as we have demonstrated here for THP-1 cells and previously for monocytes ( 21 ) , inhibitors of tyrosine kinases can block message induction mediated by cell adhesion or by ligation of B1 integrins .
These inhibitors also blocked activation of an NF- « B driven promoter-reporter construct in transient transfection assays ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it seems highly probable that integrin engagement can trigger activation of tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphorylation events that are critical for the control of inflammatory mediator genes in monocytic cells .
Therefore , it is important to carefully analyze integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation to try to define those events most closely related to the message induction process .
We have examined THP-1 lysates for evidence of integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins previously identified as being involved in signal transduction cascades or linked to integrin-dependent cytoskeletal reorgani-zation .
In THP-1 cells , the focal contact protein paxillin and the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases FAK and Syk became tyrosine phosphorylated in response to integrin-mediated cell adhesion .
The activation of FAK by integrin ligation , as well as by other stimuli , has been observed in a number of cell types ( 35 , 39 ) ; paxillin is a substrate for FAK , and its tyrosine phosphorylation seems to parallel the activation of the FAK kinase ( 23 , 41 ) .
That FAK and paxillin are tyrosine phosphorylated during THP-1 cell adhesion suggests that these molecules may be involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and formation of focal adhesive sites in these cells ; a similar role for these proteins has been postulated in fibroblasts ( 23 , 42 ) .
Since cytochalasin D effectively blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin , some degree of cytoskeletal organization and cell spreading seem to be required for these events .
Ligation of B1 integrins with antibodies did not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK or paxillin but did cause increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk , a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that contains SH2 domains ( 24 , 25 ) .
The Syk kinase has been reported to associate with several receptors , including the antigen receptors on B-cells ( 43 ) , the Fc receptors for IgE ( FeeRI ) ( 44 ) and IgG ( FoeyRI , FeyRIII ) ( 45 , 46 ) , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor ( 26 ) .
Syk kinase becomes activated and tyrosine phosphorylated when those receptors bind their respective ligands .
A consensus motif has been defined in the cytoplasmic domains of receptors that bind Syk or the related kinase ZAPT7O0 ( 26 ) .
Impaired signal transduction processes have been found in Syk kinase negative cells or in cells that express a Syk mutant lacking kinase activity ( 43 ) .
Since Syk can be activated via Fc receptors , we used F ( ab ' ) , fragments of anti-integrin antibodies to demonstrate that integrin ligation , rather than Fc receptor engagement , was responsible for the increase in Syk enzymatic activity and tyrosine phosphorylation that we observed .
In addition , the fact that Syk can be activated by integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin substrata also indicates that integrins rather than Fc receptors are involved .
Since integrin cytoplasmic domains do not contain any obvious homologies to the Syk binding motif found in other cognate receptors ( 26 ) , it seems likely that the interaction between integrins and Syk is indirect .
In support of this , we have not been able to co-immunoprecipitate Syk and integrins from cell lysates ( data not shown ) .
Recent studies in platelets have shown that the Syk kinase can be activated via engagement of the allb/fB3 integrin by fibrinogen ( 48 ) .
Thus , in both monocytic cells and platelets , Syk is an integrin-responsive tyrosine kinase .
The activation of Syk , in contrast to the activation of FAK , is not completely dependent on cytoskeletal assembly as observed here as well as in previous studies on platelets ( 48 ) .
Interestingly , recent investigations in rat baso- 16196 philic leukemia cells have shown that cross-linking of the FeeRI receptor can trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin , while receptor cross-linking in adherent cells can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of both FAK and a stronger phosphorylation of paxillin ( 47 , 49 ) .
These results may have similar underlying mechanisms to the results presented here , since multi-valent cross-linking of FceeRI receptors may cause engagement of the cytoskeleton , setting the stage for FAK and paxillin phosphorylation .
Either integrin-mediated cell adhesion or antibody ligation of integrins can effectively increase IL-1B message levels , as well as causing changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation .
However , antibody ligation affected the Syk tyrosine kinase but not FAK or its substrate paxillin .
Furthermore , treatment with cytochalasin D , which effectively blocked cell spreading and FAK and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation , failed to block Syk tyrosine phosphorylation or increases in IL-1B message levels .
Thus , it seems that FAK is not required for integrin-mediated IL-18 message induction in THP-1 cells , consistent with our previous observations on primary monocytes ( 21 ) .
Conversely , our results suggest that Syk may play an important role in the signal transduction process leading from integrin engagement to the induction of inflammatory mediator genes .
Thus , the activation of Syk uniformly precedes and accompanies integrin-mediated gene induction , while similar concentrations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors block both Syk autophosphorylation and IL-1B message induction .
The integrin-mediated changes in tyrosine phosphorylation and Syk activation are transient even during continued cell adhesion or antibody ligation .
This suggests that these processes are regulated , perhaps through the agency of protein phosphatases that are induced or activated subsequent to integrin stimulation .
Similar events have been associated with the regulation of kinase activities stimulated by mitogens ( 40 ) .
Current evidence indicates that Syk is an integrin-responsive tyrosine kinase .
It also suggests the existence of a signal transduction pathway in monocytic cells that involves the ligation of integrins , activation of the Syk tyrosine kinase , the triggering of downstream events , activation of the NF- « B transcription complex , and the eventual induction of messages for inflammatory mediator genes .
Extensive cytoskeletal reorganization does not seem to be required in this pathway , since cytochalasin D treatment had little effect on IL-1B message levels .
In those types of monocytic cells that do express FAK , such as THP-1 , there is a second integrin-mediated signaling pathway that involves FAK activation , and that seems to impact primarily on cytoskeletal organization rather than gene induction .
At this point , a number of issues require further study .
It is not certain that activation of the Syk tyrosine kinase is essential for integrin-mediated gene induction , as opposed to simply accompanying the induction process , nor can the participation of additional tyrosine kinases be ruled out .
Further experiments will be required to establish a causal role for Syk in integrin signaling .
In addition , the downstream events linking changes in tyrosine phosphorylation to alterations of inflammatory gene message levels remain to be defined .
In monocytes , it is clear that integrin ligation induces transcriptional activation of the IL-1 gene but does not affect message stabil-ity .
?
In the THP-1 cell system , integrin ligation leads to activation of NF-KB , increased transcription from NF- « B-driven reporter constructs , and increases in IL-1B message levels .
However , it is not clear at present if integrin-mediated changes ° Lofquist , A. K. , Mondal , K. , Morris , J. S. , and Haskill , J. S. ( 1995 ) Mol .

Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Cytokine Message Induction in IL-1B message levels in THP-1 cells are primarily controlled at the transcriptional level or by other means , such as changes in message stability or RNA splicing .
If transcriptional activation does occur , the precise role of NF- « B and of other transcription factors remains to be defined .
Despite these ques-tions , current observations provide important initial insights into integrin signal transduction processes in monocytic cells and emphasize a key role for specific tyrosine phosphorylation events .
