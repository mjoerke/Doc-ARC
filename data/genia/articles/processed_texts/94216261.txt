Communication A Novel Heterodimerization Partner for Thyroid Hormone Receptor PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR* ( Received for publication , January 26 , 1994 , and in revised form , February 11 , 1994 ) Fausto Bogazzi , Lynn D.

Nikodem { § From the Genetics and Biochemistry Branch , Mechanisms of Gene Regulation Section , NIDDK and the { Laboratory of Viral and Molecular Pathogenesis , NINDS , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 Retinoid-like receptors play a central role in hormonal responses by forming heterodimers with other nuclear hormone receptors .
In this study we have identified the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) as a new thyroid hormone receptor ( THR ) auxiliary nuclear protein , heterodimerizing with THR in solution .
Although these heterodimers do not recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element ( TRE ) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides ( DR + 4 ) , PPAR behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone ( TH ) action .
However , a TH-dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the THRG-PPAR but not the THRa-PPAR heterodimer with a novel TRE ( DR + 2 ) .
The critical region of THRB was mapped to 3 amino acids in the distal box of the DNA binding domain .
Hence , PPAR can positively or negatively influence TH action depending on TRE structure and THR isotype .
The diversity provided by heterodimerization within the subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors offers additional levels of regulation .
In a hormone-dependent manner the RXR'-contain-ing heterodimers modulate transcription of target genes via hormone response elements arranged as DR ( 1 , 2 ) .
The spacer length between these repeats plays an important role in achieving selective hormonal responses .
Thus , the spacing of 3 , 4 , and 5 nucleotides is recognized by heterodimers of RXR with vitamin D receptor , THR , and retinoic acid receptor , respectively ( 2-7 ) .
However , a degeneracy of this spacer rule has been sug-gested , since RXR-retinoic acid receptor heterodimers can also * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

Moreover , the DR + 1 element conveys clofibrate-dependent transactivation , mediated by PPAR-RXR heterodimers ( 9-11 ) .
The molecular basis underlying these promiscuous interactions is unknown .
It is possible that within this subfamily more than one RXR-like heterodimerization partner with different heterodimerization specificity may exist .
THR and PPAR appear to play an important role in lipid metabolism , and , thus , their signaling pathways might be coupled .
Hence , we investigated the possibility that PPAR might be another THR auxiliary nuclear protein .
In this report we describe the functional significance of THR-PPAR heterodimers in the context of a classical TRE ( DR + 4 ) and a newly described TRE ( DR + 2 ) .

The expression plasmid CMV , PPAR containing the rat PPAR cDNA subcloned in the BamHI/BgiII sites of CMV , expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. F. Gonzales .
The reporter plasmid PJBO42-CAT containing the human myelin proteolipid protein ( PLP ) gene promoter sequence ( -312/+85 ) and chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase ( CAT ) coding sequence has been described ( 13 ) .
The reporter constructs malic enzyme ( ME ) -TRE-TK-CAT and TSHG-TRE-TK-CAT were described ( 12 ) .
The reporter construct PLP-TRE wild type ( wt ) TK-CAT was constructed by inserting a single copy of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the PLP gene sequence at position -10/+52 ( TGTCAATCAGAAAGCCCTTTTCATTGCAGGAGAAGAGGACAAAG-ATACTCAGAGAGAAAAAG ) in restriction sites of pBLCAT 2 vector .
The direct repeats on the sequence of PLP-TRE are underlined .
The reporter construct PLP-TRE mutated TK-CAT contains mutations ( G ; - > Ty , C , - > A ; ) in direct repeats only .
Identity of PLP-TRE , wt or mutated , was confirmed by sequencing ( 15 ) .
Thyroid hormone chimeric receptors ( chim ) 1-4 were constructed using the recombinant polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) .
For the primary reactions , specific oligonucleotide primers were designed .
The external primers had sequences complementary to the amino terminus of THRa ( chim 1 and 2 ) or THR $ ( chim 3 and 4 ) and carried at their 5'-ends an internal HindIII recognition sequence .
The other external primers were complementary to the carboxyl terminus of THR $ ( chim 1 , 2 , and 4 ) or THRe ( chim 3 ) and carried at their 3'-ends the pal recognition sequence .
Appropriate internal primers were designed for each chimeric receptor .
Internal primers had the sequence of both junction regions to generate sticky ends for a subsequent annealing .
The products of the primary PCR reaction were purified , an-nealed , and used as templates in a secondary PCR reaction together with both external primers to generate the final chimeras .
PCR reactions were performed as suggested by the supplier ( Perkin-Elmer ) .
After 25 cycles of amplification ( denaturation , 1 min , 94 °C ; annealing , 1 min , 55 °C ; extension , 45 s , 72 °C ) the final reaction products were purified on low melting point agarose gel and subcloned into HindIIl/Hpal sites of the expression plasmid RSV Aneo .
The identity of chimeric receptors was confirmed by sequencing ( 15 ) .
Each chimeric receptor was capable of mediating TH-dependent activation of ME-TRE-TK-CAT ( data not shown ) .
In vitro translated receptors were prepared using pSP72 vector containing either a rat THRa , THR $ , or PPAR cDNA sequence , and unlabeled or [ °*°S ] Met-labeled receptors were produced from rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to the supplier 's instructions ( Promega ) .
Efficiency of translation was similar for any cDNA as estimated by SDS gel elec-trophoresis .
Cell Culture and Transfection Assays-NIH3T3 and NG108-15 cells were grown as described ( 16 ) .
Transfection assays were performed using a Gene-Pulser Electroporator ( Bio-Rad ) as described ( 17 ) .
Briefly , 25 ug of a reporter plasmid was electroporated into NIH3T3 or NG108-15 cells ( 4.2 x 10° ) with 12.5 ug of either RSV-THRa , RSV-THRS , RSV-RXRf , CMV , -PPAR expression plasmid , or any combination of two .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION TH responsiveness of a human PLP promoter -312/+85 CAT reporter was tested in transient transfection assays using either NIH3T3 or NG108-15 cells .
Neither THRa nor THRB alone or in combination with RXRB and 9-cis-retinoic acid conferred TH responsiveness to this reporter ( Fig .
14 ) .
The PLP reporter activity was greatly enhanced , however , by coexpression of THRB and PPAR in the presence of TH .
Inclusion of the activator of PPAR was not necessary ( data not shown ) .
Surpris-ingly , THRa « in this system was inactive , suggesting that specific regulation of this promoter requires THRB-PPAR heterodimers .
Functional analyses of 5'- and 3'-deletion mutants of the PLP promoter showed that PLP-TRE resides within the -10 to +52 fragment ( data not shown ) .
This fragment contains a nearly perfect DR + 2 ( AGGAGAagAGGACA ) at position +18/ +31 within the untranslated region of the first exon .
Synthetic oligonucleotides , containing the wild type but not mutated sequence of the DR + 2 , conferred a TH response to a TK promoter in the presence of THRB and PPAR ( Fig .
1B ) .
Using an elec-tromobility shift assay only THRB-PPAR heterodimers were capable of forming a complex , either with a PLP promoter fragment ( Fig .
24 ) or with a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the wt but not mutated PLP-TRE sequence ( Fig .
2B ) .
Furthermore , formation of the complex was prevented by inclusion of myelin basic protein TRE ( 16 ) as a specific competitor .
Thus , THRa « or THRB-RXR heterodimers recognize DR + 4 ( 3-5 ) in contrast to the THRB-PPAR heterodimer which also THRa « , THRB , and PPAR Heterodimer Coupling of Signaling Pathways 11685 1 AB DNA Hinge LIGAND 456 THRB _ [ | [ TU 1 410 THR a GOP 1___ 4695 456 Chim 1 PPA ___ ___| 1 1777226 456 Chim 2 Coot ___| 1 227178 410 Chim 3 [ ___ ___ Hra 1 142/94 96/146 456 Chim 4 _ [ ] 194/142 146/96 410 Chim 5 presence of THR and PPAR , which was Fic .

Formation of THR-PPAR heterodimers in solution analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation assay .
[ *°S ] Met-labeled PPAR and THRa « proteins were generated by in vitro reactions , and unlabeled THRa « was from Sf-9 cells overexpressing this receptor as described under `` Materials and Methods . ``
The coimmunoprecipitation reactions with THRa polyclonal antiserum included 5 ul of in vitro synthesized [ *S ) Met-labeled PPAR and 0.1 ul of Sf-9 nuclear extracts containing THRa « ( lane 6 ) , [ °*°S ] Met PPAR alone ( lane 5 ) or in combination with 0.1 pl of Sf-9 wt extract ( lane 3 ) , or 5 ul of [ *S ] Met THRa « ( lane 2 ) , or 5 ul each of [ *S ] Met PPAR and THRa ( Zane 1 ) or 10 ul of [ *S ] Met unprogrammed lysate ( lane 4 ) .
All reactions contained THRa « polyclonal an-tiserum .

recognizes DR + 2 .
Furthermore , these data also point out a functional difference between THRa and THRB .
To disclose the domain of the THRB involved in the THRB-PPAR heterodimer , we constructed several chimeric receptors ( Fig .
3 ) .
Chimeras 1-3 in which the A/B domain , DBD , and ligand binding domain ( LBD ) of THRa « and THRB were exchanged were tested for TH-dependent transactivation of PLP-TRE-10/+52-TK-CAT in the presence of PPAR ( Fig .
3 ) .
Both the A/B domain ( chim 1 ) and LBD ( chim 3 ) are fully exchangeable .
By contrast , the THR DBD is necessary for the TH response ( chim 2 ) .
It has been reported that the amino acid composition of two distinct boxes in a nuclear hormone receptor DBD might be sufficient to determine a hormone response element specific recognition ( 18 ) .
THR $ and THRa « share the same proximal box implicated in recognition of the primary nucleotide sequence but have a dissimilar D box , which presumably serves as a receptor dimerization interface , discriminating between the spacing of the half-sites .
When the Glu , Gly , and Lys amino acids of the THRB D box were replaced by Asp , Ser , and Cys of the THRa « D box ( chim 4 ) , TH-dependent transcriptional activity of the reporter was abolished .
However , the exchange of the THRa « D box with that of THRB ( chim 5 ) was sufficient , in the presence of PPAR , for eliciting TH-dependent activation of the same reporter .
Hence , THR recognizes the 2-nucleotide gap in PLP-TRE through its D box when heterodimerized with PPAR .
Interestingly , DR + 2 can confer TH responsiveness by discriminating between THRa and THRB , suggesting that these recep- THRa , THRB , and PPAR Heterodimer Coupling of Signaling Pathways tors could be functionally distinct .
Next , we examined a role of PPAR on TH-dependent activity of a positive , DR + 4 ( ME ) and negative , DR + 0 ( TSH ) TRE ( 12 , 17 ) .
As shown in Fig .
44 , coexpression of PPAR , either with THRa or THRB , abolished the TH-dependent activation and inhibition of ME-TRE-TK-CAT and TSHB-TRE-TK-CAT , respectively .
The negative effect was a consequence of the formation of THR-PPAR het-erodimers , as demonstrated by a coimmunoprecipitation assay ( Fig .
5 ) , which , in contrast to THR-RXR heterodimers ( 14 ) , can not interact with ME-TRE ( DR + 4 ) as shown in Fig .
4B .
Since both RXR ( 12 ) and PPAR ( herein ) can abrogate TH-dependent negative regulation of TSH gene , it seems likely that the effect of PPAR is mediated by formation of inactive THR-PPAR heterodimers rather than PPAR-RXR heterodimers .
In conclusion , TH action can be modulated by heterodimerization of PPAR with THRa or THRB .
The negative effect of PPAR appears to be due to sequestering of THR in inactive complex in the absence of DNA .
A different steric conformation of the two heterodimers probably determines that only THRB-PPAR can bind to a DR + 2 .
This represents a new mechanism by which TH can activate genes containing a DR + 2 and provides evidence for coupling of THR and PPAR signaling pathways .
