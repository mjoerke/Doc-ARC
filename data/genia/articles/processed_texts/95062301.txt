Herzenberg , August 1 , 1994 ABSTRACT Studies presented here show that overall NF-sB signal transduction begins with a parallel series of stimuli-specific pathways through which cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor a ) , oxidants ( hydrogen peroxide and mitomycin C ) , and phorbol ester ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) individually initiate signaling .
These initial pathways culminate in a common pathway through which all of the stimulating agents ultimately signal NF-xB activation .
We distinguish the stimuli-specific pathways by showing that the oxidative stimuli trigger NF-xB activation in only one of two human T-cell lines ( Wurzburg but not Jurkat ) , whereas tumor necrosis factor a and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate readily stimulate in both lines .
We propose the common pathway as the simplest way of accounting for the common requirements and properties of the signaling pathway .
We include a redox-regulatory mecha-nism ( s ) in this common pathway to account for the previously demonstrated redox regulation of NF-xB activation in Jurkat cells ( in which oxidants do n't activate we put tyrosine phosphorylation in the common pathway by showing that kinase activity ( inhibitable by herbimycin A and tyrphostin 47 ) is required for NF- » cB activation by all stimuli tested in both cell lines .
Since internal sites of oxidant production have been shown to play a key role in the cytokine-stimulated activation of NF-xB , and since tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities are known to be altered by oxidants , these findings suggest that intracellular redox status controls NF-xB activation by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation event ( s ) within the common step of the NF-xB signal transduction pathway .
The activated form of the nuclear transcription factor NF- « B increases transcription of inflammatory response genes and viral genes , notably human immunodeficiency virus ( 1 ) .
The unactivated form of this transcription factor is sequestered in the cytosol by member ( s ) of the I- « B family .
T-cell stimulation by a wide variety of agents , ranging from phorbol esters ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; PMA ) and cytokines [ tu-mor necrosis factor a ( TNF-a ) and interleukin 1a } to oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide ( H ; 0 ; ) and UV irradiation , cause I- « B to dissociate from the NF- « B complex .
The release of NF- « B from its inhibitory protein ( s ) permits the translocation of NF-KB into the nucleus , where it binds to DNA enhancer motifs and regulates transcription of a diverse series of genes ( 1 , 2 ) .
Intracellular redox levels have been shown to regulate NF- « B signal transduction triggered by a variety of stimuli ( 3 , 4 ) .
H ; O ; and UV triggering of NF- « B activation are often used as models of this common redox regulation ; however , we show here that the mechanism responsible for triggering by these oxidants is genetically separable from the common , The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

11527 redox-sensitive mechanism that operates in response to all stimuli .
We also demonstrate a common requirement for protein tyrosine phosphorylation in NF- « B activation .
Since the collective activity of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases stimulated is redox regulated ( 5-7 ) , we suggest that the redox regulation of these enzymes contributes to the redox sensitivity of the common step of the NF- « B signal transduction pathway .
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Cell Lines And Culture .
Patrick Baeuerle ( Ludwig Univer-sitat , Freiburg , Germany ) kindly provided Wurzburg Jurkat T cells ( subclone JR ) , and the Jurkat T-cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( TIB152 ) .
Jurkat « BS5.2 clone , derived from TIB152 , has been described ( 8 ) .
Cell lines were cultured as described ( 8 ) .
Cell Stimulation and Reporter Gene Assays .
Cells were preincubated with the inhibitors herbimycin A ( Biomol , Plymouth Meeting , PA ) and tyrphostin 47 ( Biomol ) and stimulated with H ; 0 ; ( Fisher ) , PMA ( Sigma ) , mitomycin C ( Mito-C ; Sigma ) , and TNF-a ( Cetus ) as described in the figure legends .
Cells to be UV irradiated were resuspended in PBS containing 1 % ( wt/vol ) glucose and irradiated with a Stratagene Stratalinker model 2400 at 254 nm .
After irradiation , cells were pelleted and resuspended in RPMI containing 10 % ( vol/vol ) fetal calf serum .
-Galactosidase reporter gene activity was measured with 4-methylumbelliferyl $ 5-galactoside as described ( 8 ) .
Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays .
Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Schreiber et al .
( 9 ) except that buffer C contained 10 % ( wt/vol ) glyc-erol .
The NF- « B and AP-1 probes and the gel retardation analysis methods have been described ( 10 , 11 ) .
RESULTS Separation of Oxidant Stimulation and Redox Regulation .
The mechanisms that mediate redox regulation and oxidant stimulation of NF- « B activation are resolved by studies with two human T-cell lines , Jurkat and Jurkat JR. We obtained the latter line from P. Bacuerle and provisionally call it Wurzburg ( after its city of origin ) .
Its surface marker expression and T-cell receptor rearrangement ( shown in Fig .
1 ) clearly distinguish it from the Jurkat line that is commonly used in the U.S. and is available from the American Type Culture Collection .

- The T-cell receptor rearrangements of the Wurzburg ( W ) and Jurkat ( J ) T-cell lines are distinct .
Genomic DNA from the Wurzburg and Jurkat cell lines was analyzed by Southern analysis with either a 0.7-kb Xba JB1 or a 4.5-kb EcoRI JB2 labeled genomic probe after restriction digestion with either Bai II or BamHI .
shown ) include the following : Jurkat expresses CD2 , CD4SRA , and high levels of CD3 and the C305 idiotype ( 12 ) ; Wurzburg lacks CD2 and CD4SRA , expresses low levels of CD45RO and CD3 , and does not express the C305 idiotype .
Baeuerle and colleagues ( 4 ) demonstrated that NF-KB is readily activated in the Wurzburg line by stimulation with H , O ; and UV .
Data in Fig .
2 confirm these findings and show further that another oxidative stimulus , Mito-C ( 13 ) , also activates NF- « B in Wurzburg .
These oxidative stimuli , however , do not detectably activate NF- « B in Jurkat ( Fig .
2 ; also see ref .
14 ) .
Thus , the mechanism through which oxidants trigger NF- « B activation in Wurzburg does not function in the Jurkat cell line .
The redox-sensitive mechanism that regulates NF-KB activation by PMA and cytokines , however , is fully functional in Jurkat ( and in Wurzburg ) .
Antioxidants block stimulation of NF- « B activation by these agents in Jurkat ( 3 , 14 , 15 ) and in Wurzburg ( 4 ) ; nordihydroguaiaretic acid completely inhibits both PMA and TNF-a stimulations in Jurkat ( data not shown ) ; and N-acetylcysteine , which acts both as an antiox-idant and as a source of cysteine for replenishing intracellular glutathione , blocks NF-KB activation consistently but to a lesser extent ( 40 % for TNF-a @ stimulation ; 75 % for PMA stimulation ) in both Jurkat and Wurzburg .

USA 91 ( 1994 ) Taken together , the above findings demonstrate that NF- « B activation is redox regulated in Jurkat T cells , despite the inability of oxidants to stimulate NF- « B activation in these cells .
Thus , two redox-sensitive mechanisms must be involved in NF- « B signal transduction .
One , present only in Wurzburg , allows oxidants such as H ; O ; to trigger NF- « B activation .
The other , present both in Jurkat and Wurzburg , allows intracellular redox levels to regulate the extent of NF- « B activation .
Protein Tyrosine Phosphorylation Is a General Requirement for NF-xB Activation .
Karin and colleagues ( 5 ) , working with the HeLa cell line , have shown that UV stimulation activates Src kinase ( s ) , which phosphorylate particular protein tyrosine residues .
This activation is an essential component of the signal transduction pathway leading to activation of NF- « B and AP-1 , another transcription factor .
The studies that follow confirm the requirement for protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the oxidant stimulation of NF- « B induction and implicate tyrosine phosphorylation events as essential for NF- « B activation , both by oxidative and nonoxidative stimuli .
Thus we demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation is a general requirement for NF- « B activation in human lymphocytes .
Reporter Gene Studies .
Cytokines and PMA stimulate the expression of a stable , integrated reporter gene construct ( tri- « B lacZ in Jurkat ) whose transcription is controlled by a tandem trimer of NF- « B binding sites ( 8 ) .
Two differently acting tyrosine kinase inhibitors , herbimycin A and tyrphostin 47 , completely inhibit stimulation of this transcription factor by either PMA or TNF-a ( Figs .
3B and 4 ) .
This complete inhibition is observed after either a short-term , high-dose herbimycin A ( 4 hr , 10 ug/ml ) preincubation or the long-term , low-dose preincubation conditions ( 18 hr , 0.5-3 pg/ml ) used by many laboratories .
Herbimycin A is a widely used tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is attributed to be a selective inhibitor of Src-like kinases ( 15 ) by targeting their degradation .
It is relatively nontoxic and does not interfere with protein synthesis , PMA/ ionomycin stimulation of interleukin 2 production , or signaling via pathways that do not depend on tyrosine kinase activity [ e.g .
, pathways dependent upon serine/threonine kinases or guanine nucleotide-binding-protein-dependent signaling pathways ( 16-18 ) ] .
Furthermore , it only minimally decreases the PMA-signaled induction of the T-cell surface `` activation `` antigen , CD69 ( Fig .

( A ) Surface expression of PMA-induced activation mark-ers .
Jurkat T cells were preincubated with a variety of concentrations of herbimycin A for 18 hr , stimulated with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) for 16 hr in the continuous presence of herbimycin A , and then analyzed for surface expression of the interleukin 2 receptor ( IL-2R ) and CD69 by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses after staining of the cells with phycoerythrin-labeled monoclonal antibodies .
Frequency of cells expressing the indicated surface marker is determined by staining with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies and gating to include cells with associated fluorescence greater than two standard deviations above the median autofluorescence .
( B ) Reporter gene assay for NF- « B activation .
Jurkat « B5.2 cells with an integrated construct consisting of three « B sites linked to lacZ were preincubated for 18 hr with a range of concentrations of herbimycin A and then stimulated with TNF-a ( 20 ng/ml ) or PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) .
Cells were lysed , and -galactosidase activity was assayed as percentage of the lacZ activity obtained in the absence of inhibitor ( an index of NF- « B-dependent transcription ) .
Error bars indicate the standard deviation of 10 replicates per condition .
as Fig .
3B shows , it completely inhibits the NF- « B dependent induction of interleukin 2 receptor surface expression by PMA in Jurkat T cells .
Expression of the NF- « B-controlled reporter gene in Jurkat is also inhibited by a pseudosubstrate tyrosine kinase inhibitor , tyrphostin 47 ( 20 , 21 ) .
Preincubation for 30 min with a wide range of tyrphostin 47 concentrations blocks the expression of the tri- « B lacZ reporter gene in cells stimulated either with PMA or TNF-a ( Fig .
4 ) .
Thus , two tyrosine kinase inhibitors with different modes of action block signaling of NF- « B-dependent gene expression .

Herbimycin A inhibits the activation of NF- « B , but not AP-1 , in Jurkat T cells .
Jurkat T cells were pretreated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A for 4 hr and stimulated with TNF-a or PMA .

vate/translocate free NF- « B to the nucleus ( Fig .

NF- « B bands are readily detectable in gels of nuclear extracts prepared from PMA or TNF-a-stimulated cells ; however , these bands are missing in gels of extracts from cells preincubated with herbimycin A ( 4 hr , 10 ug/ml ) prior to stimulation ( 22 , 23 ) .
Bomsztyk and colleagues ( 23 ) , using another herbimycin A treatment protocol that inhibits NF- « B activation by IL-1-a , recently reported that herbimycin A does not inhibit PMA activation of A NF- « B .
We also failed to inhibit PMA-stimulated activation of NF- « B with herbimycin A when we used this protocol ( 10 ug/ml for 1 hr ) ( data not shown ) .
However , since herbimycin A fully inhibits PMA-stimulated NF- « B activation when cells are pretreated for a longer time ( 10 ug/ml for 4 hr ; see above ) , we ascribe the lack of inhibition with the Bomstyk protocol to its inability to deplete intracellular tyrosine kinase activity to a level that would limit NF- « B activation by a strong stimulus such as PMA .

- Herbimycin A blocks activation of NF- « B by oxidants .
The oxidant-sensitive Wurzburg cell line was stimulated with PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) , TNF-a ( 20 ng/ml ) , hydrogen peroxide ( 150 uM ) , or Mito-C ( 300 uM ) after a 4-hr preincubation with or without herbimycin A .

that herbimycin A blocks the H ; O ; and Mito-C activation of NF- « B ( Fig .
6 ) .
These findings confirm previous findings demonstrating that herbimycin A blocks both H ; O » and yirradiation ( 24 , 25 ) and that tyrphostin 47 blocks UV-stimulated NF- « B activation ( 26 ) .
Thus , tyrosine kinase activity is required both for the oxidant-initiated and redox-regulated components of the signal transduction pathway leading to the activation of NF- « B .
PMA has also been shown to stimulate activation of AP-1 , another transcription factor important for T-cell function .
This stimulation is not redox-regulated and does not involve tyrosine phosphorylation ( 5 ) .
Thus , as we show above , it is not inhibited by herbimycin A ( Fig .
5 ) .
The demonstration that herbimycin A inhibits the stimulation of NF- « B activation therefore reflects the selective inhibition of NF- « B activation .
DISCUSSION Studies presented here use two human T-cell lines , Wurzburg and Jurkat , to distinguish the mechanism through which oxidants specifically induce NF- « B signal transduction from the downstream mechanism in which oxidants serve as essential messengers in the signal transduction pathway ( s ) initiated by all NF-KB inducers .
As we have shown , oxidants readily induce NF-KB activation in Wurzburg but do not trigger the induction of this transcription factor in Jurkat ; however , nonoxidative molecules such as PMA and TNF induce NF- « B activation in both Wurzburg and Jurkat .
Furthermore , although oxidants trigger insufficient signals to activate NF- « B activation in Jurkat , the induction of this factor in both T-cell lines by other stimuli depends upon the generation of intracellular oxidants ( 27 ) .
Taken together , these findings suggest that oxidants , cytokines , and other agents initiate signal transduction by triggering separate , inducer-specific `` receptors `` and that the signals generated by these inducer-specific receptors ultimately flow through a common , redox-regulated step of the signal transduction pathway to activate NF- « B . '
Recent studies show that the cytokine-stimulated production of mitochondria-derived oxidants regulate , but do not initiate , NF- « B activation ( 28 ) .
In essence , these studies show that cytokine-stimulated activation of NF- « B requires superoxide production by mitochondria but that this activation does not occur without additional signaling events .
Since the stimulation of mitochondrial oxidant production must occur late in the signal transduction pathway and is neces-sary , but not sufficient , for NF- « B activation , we propose that it occurs in the common step of the pathway and plays a key role in the redox regulatory activity of this step ( s ) , perhaps , as discussed below , by regulating essential protein tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig .
7 ) .
Tyrosine kinase activity has been shown to be essential to certain of the inducer-specific steps of the NF- « B signal transduction pathway , notably in the early signaling events triggered by anti-CD3 and by oxidants ( 24 , 26 , 29 ) .
However , as we have shown here , tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( herbimy-cin A and tyrphostin 47 ) inhibit NF- « B activation by all stimuli tested ( i.e .
, oxidants , cytokines , and PMA ) .
These findings suggest that tyrosine kinase activity is a common requirement for the triggering of NF- « B activation and hence that one or more of these kinases is essential to the passage of signals through the common pathway step .
Thus our data implicate both tyrosine kinase activity ( protein tyrosine phos-phorylation ) and redox regulation in this common step .
This idea is attractive because it provides a plausible mechanism through which the redox environment can regulate signal flow through the pathway .
Tyrosine kinase activity can be increased by oxidants and decreased by antioxidants .
In contrast , tyrosine phosphatase activity , which dephos-phorylates the protein tyrosine residues that are phosphor Proc .

ylated by tyrosine kinases , is inhibited by oxidants and protected by antioxidants ( 5-7 ) .
Thus , we suggest that redox-regulating agents such as N-acetylcysteine and nordihydroguaiaretic acid , which increase the cell 's ability to reduce/ inactivate internally generated oxidants , controls NF- « B activation by controlling the extent to which mitochondrial-derived oxidants increase tyrosine phosphorylation .
Consistent with this hypothesis , we have recently shown that TNF-a becomes an effective stimulator of overall protein tyrosine phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells when cells are pretreated with the agent buthionine sulfoximine , which depletes glutathione , the principal intracellular redox buffer ( 30 ) .
Tyrosine phosphorylation is barely detectable in phos-photyrosine blots when cells are stimulated at normal glu-tathione levels ; however , blots of extracts from glutathione-depleted cells demonstrate that TNF-a stimulates as much overall tyrosine phosphorylation as anti-CD3 .
This redox regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation would be readily explained if , as we propose , the signals generated by triggering cells with oxidants , cytokines , and phorbol esters converge on a common pathway that leads initially to generation of mitochondrial oxidants , which in turn increases protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the transmission of signals that stimulate NF-KB activation ( Fig .
