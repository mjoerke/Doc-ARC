Lipopolysaccharide Induction of the Tumor Necrosis Factor-a « Promoter in Human Monocytic Cells REGULATION BY Egr-1 , c-Jun , AND NF- « B TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS* ( Received for publication , January 22 , 1997 , and in revised form , May 7 , 1997 ) Jin Yao , Nigel Mackman , Thomas S. Edgington , and Sao-Tah Fant From the Department of Immunology , The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , California 92037 Biosynthesis of tumor necrosis factor-a ( LNF-a ) is predominantly by cells of the monocytic lineage .
This study examined the role of various cis-acting regulatory elements in the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of the human TNF-a promoter in cells of monocytic lineage .
Functional analysis of monocytic THP-1 cells transfected with plasmids containing various lengths of TNF-a promoter localized enhancer elements in a region ( -182 to -37 base pairs ( bp ) ) that were required for optimal transcription of the TNF-a gene in response to LPS .
Two regions were identified : region I ( -182 to -162 bp ) contained an overlapping Spl/Egr-1 site , and region II ( -119 to -88 ) contained CRE and NF-B ( designated B3 ) sites .
In unstimulated THP CRE-binding protein and , to a lesser extent , c-Jun complexes were found to bind to the CRE site .
LPS stimulation increased the binding of c-Jun-containing complexes .
In addition , LPS stimulation induced the binding of cognate nuclear factors to the Egr-1 and « B3 sites , which were identified as Egr-1 and p50/p65 , respectively .
The CRE and « B3 sites in region II together conferred strong LPS responsiveness to a heterologous promoter , whereas individually they failed to provide transcriptional activation .
Furthermore , increasing the spacing between the CRE and the « B3 sites completely abolished LPS induction , suggesting a cooperative interaction between c-Jun complexes and p50/p65 .
These studies indicate that maximal LPS induction of the TNF-a « promoter is mediated by concerted participation of at least two separate cis-acting regulatory elements .
Tumor necrosis factor produced primarily by cells of monocytic lineage , is involved in a plethora of cell regulatory and differentiative processes .
TNF-a is also a vital mediator of the host defense against infection and tumor formation .
On the other hand , TNF-a @ is involved in the pathophysiology of numerous diseases including septic shock , cachexia , and various autoimmune diseases ( 1 ) .
Therefore , TNF-a exhibits both beneficial and pathologic effects , a feature that requires rigorous control of its expression .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org sion in cells of monocytic lineage is quite complex , involving controls at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels ( 2 ) .
In addition , both 5 and 3 ' nucleotide sequences influence LPS-induced transcription of human TNF-a cDNA transfected into the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line ( 8 ) .
The promoter region of the human TNF-a gene contains a complex array of potential regulatory elements .
In T cells , cooperation between the CRE and the adjacent « B3 sites is required for calcium-mediated TNF-a promoter activity ( 4 ) , and cooperation between the CRE and the adjacent Ets sites for PMA-induced activity ( 5 ) .
However , the role or these regulatory elements in transcriptional activation of the TNF-a gene in human monocytes remains unclear .
To date , published reports indicate that activation of TNF- « gene transcription in human monocytes in response to various stimuli is mediated by a region within -200 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site ( 6-12 ) .
Using a promonocytic leukemia cell line , U937 , several nuclear factor binding elements , including AP-1 ( 6 ) , Egr-1 ( 7 ) , CRE ( 8 ) , C/EBPB ( 9 ) , and AP-2 ( 10 ) , have been suggested to mediate TNF-a « transcription in response to PMA or cytokines .
These results appear to be incomplete and often conflicting .
No consensus has been reached , and no cooperation between these regulatory elements was established .
Although the reasons for these discrepancies are unclear , the U937 cell line may be too poorly differentiated to serve as a suitable model of gene expression in cells of monocytic lineage .
Transcriptional activation of the murine TNF- « gene in murine macrophages has been demonstrated to be predominantly dependent on a region in the murine TNF-a promoter upstream of -451 bp , which contains NF- « B DNA binding motifs ( 13 , 14 ) .
A major histocompatibility complex class II Y box was also inferred to play a role in LPS inducibility ( 13 , 14 ) .
To date , the role of NF-KB in the transcriptional activation of the human TNF-a gene in human monocytes in response to LPS is contro-versial .
An early study using murine monocytic cells failed to identify a role for the « B sites in transcriptional activation of human TNF-a in response to LPS or virus ( 15 ) .
However , recent reports employing pharmacological agents that block the nuclear translocation of NF- « B , such as pyrrolidine dithio-carbamate ( 16 ) , and sodium salicylate ( 17 ) , demonstrated a suppression of TNF-a gene expression .
Moreover , LPS induction of the human TNF-a promoter in human monocytic THP-1 leukemia cells was mediated by the « B3 site at -97 bp ( 11 ) .
Taken together , these results suggest a likelihood that murine monocytic cells are not suitable for the analysis of the regulation of the human TNF-a promoter .
In this study , we have employed a line of THP-1 cells that exhibits high inducibility for TNF-a gene transcription similar to that of freshly isolated human monocytes .
We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the role of various cis-acting regulatory elements in the transcriptional regulation of 17795 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 17796 116 106 -97 Ets CRE kB3 587 21200 172 sd 42 AP-1 Spt AP2 Lue I i | T « B1 xB2 Spf/egm1 1 1 1 I LPS Induction of TNF-a Promoter in Human Monocytes 36 Fold Induction 608 10 12 14 16 16 ames | DTNF ( 1311 ) Luc A311 ame | DTNF ( 1185 ) Luc sm | DTNF ( 615 ) Luc 1135 -+ 2 « 615 + 479 7 , 295 / amma - DTNF ( 479 ) LUC - pTNF ( 295 ) Luc 182. .

Induction of the TNF-a promoter from heterologous promoter series by LPS .
Plasmids of this series contain the minimal SV40 promoter upstream of luciferase gene in pGL2-promoter vector .
A , multiple tandem copies of DNA fragments containing sequences of interest are cloned upstream of the SV40 minimal promoter .
B , two tandem copies of DNA fragments ( -110 to -86 ) containing both the CRE and the « B sites , or DNA fragments containing bp substitutions in either site ( marked with x ) are cloned upstream of the SV40 minimal promoter .
C , three tandem copies of DNA fragments ( -110 to -86 ) with wild type sequence or with 5 , 10 , or 15 extra bases inserted between the CRE and the « B3 sites were cloned upstream of SV40 minimal promoter .
The average fold induction of luciferase activity expressed by each plasmids in transiently transfected THP-1 cells in response to LPS is shown .
Results are representative of three independent experiments .
DNA Transfection A DEAE-dextran transfection procedure ( 18 , 20 ) was used .
Briefly , 3 X 10 '' THP-1 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline and incubated for 10 to 20 min at 37 °C with 5 ug of plasmid DNA and 80 ug of DEAE-dextran ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
During incu-bation , cells were monitored closely for permeability to trypan blue .
Transfection was stopped by adding large volumes of Tris-buffered saline , usually after 10 min , when 20-30 % of cells are permeable to trypan blue .
After washing with Tris-buffered saline , cells were cultivated in media for 48 h. Cells were stimulated with 5 pg/ml LPS ( Escherichia coli 0111 : B4 purchased from Calbiochem , Lia Jolla , CA ) in a 96-well plate at 1 X 10° cells/well .
After 7 h of incubation at 37 °C , cells were harvested and luciferase activity was determined using an assay kit ( Promega ) and the Monolight 2010 luminometer ( Analytical Luminescence Laboratory , San Diego , CA ) .
Nuclear Extracts and EMSA Nuclear extracts were prepared from 5 X 10° THP-1 cells or peripheral blood monocytes stimulated under various conditions as described ( 18 , 20 ) .
Protein concentrations in nuclear extracts were determined by BCA protein assay ( Pierce ) .
Oligonucleotide probes were radiolabeled using [ a-* '' PIdCTP ( Amersham ) .
Nuclear extracts ( 1-5 ug ) were incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes ( 0.2-1 X 10° cpm ) in 2 X binding buffer ( 100 mM KCl , 1 my EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 2 mM dithio-threitol , 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin , 0.2 % Nonidet P-40 , and 40 mM Hepes ) for 20 min at room temperature .
Samples were subjected to electrophoresis through 6 % non-denaturing acrylamide gels ( Novex , San Diego , CA ) in 0.5 x Tris borate-EDTA buffer .
For antibody supershift experiments , nuclear extracts were preincubated 20 min with 2 ug of antibody before the addition of the labeled probe .
RESULTS Localization of DNA Elements Involved in the Transcriptional Activation of the TNF-a Gene in Response to LPS-To define the 5 boundary of LPS responsive elements , THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with a series of plasmids containing progressive truncations of the 55 promoter sequence between -1311 bp and -36 bp .
Deletion of sequences upstream of -182 had no significant effect on LPS-induction of the TNF-a promoter activity ( Fig .
1 ) .
Removal of a region from -182 to -162 , which contains an Spl/Egr-1 overlapping site , reduced LPS inducibility by 50 % ( from 13.3-fold to 7.8-fold ) .
Removal of a region between -161 and -121 had no significant effect on the LPS inducibility .
In contrast , deletion to -95 , which removes Ets , CRE , and « B ( « B3 ) sites , further reduced LPS inducibility ( Fig .
1 ) .
Finally , deletion to -36 removed a region containing a Spl site and abolished basal promoter activity .
These results provide new and substantial evidence that LPS induction of the TNF-a gene in monocytes involves at least two regulatory elements ; region I ( -182 to -162 ) and region II ( -120 to -96 ) .
Determination of the Roles of Various Binding Sites in the Human TNF-a Promoter by Functional Analysis of Mutant Plasmids-To determine the functional role of nuclear binding motifs in the region identified by 5'-truncation analysis , plasmids with specific site-directed mutations were examined .
Mutation in the Egr-1 site ( -169 bp ) , the CRE site ( -106 bp ) , as 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 17798 LPS Induction of TNF-a Promoter in Human Monocytes well as the « B3 site ( -97 bp ) , markedly reduced LPS induction .
In contrast , mutation of the AP-1 ( -57 bp ) or AP-2 ( -36 bp ) had no effect on LPS induction of the TNF-a promoter ( Fig .
2 ) .
These results are consistent with our findings using the 5'-deletion series of plasmids shown in Fig .
1 .
Functional Analysis of the CRE and « kB3 Sites in Heterologous Promoter Plasmids-To further explore the potential of these nuclear factor binding motifs to function as enhancer elements , we examined their ability to confer inducibility to heterologous promoter .
Neither four tandem copies of the B3 nor two copies of the CRE sites alone conferred LPS inducibility to a SV40 minimal promoter ( Fig .
34 ) .
However , when two or three copies of a DNA fragment spanning both the CRE and the xB sites were cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter strong LPS inducibility was observed ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) .
Mutation of either the CRE site ( -110/-86 m1 ) or the « B3 site ( -110/-86 m2 ) completely abolished LPS inducibility ( Fig .
3B ) .
These results suggest that the LPS induction of human TNF-a transcription requires cooperative interaction between proteins bound to the CRE and « B sites .
There is only 1 base pair separating the CRE and « B3 sites .
Whether the close proximity of the CRE site and the « B3 site is required for the optimal transactivation of TNF-a was investigated .
For these experiments , 5 , 10 , or 15 additional base pairs were added between .
CRE and « B3 sites and oligonucleotides were cloned into pGL2-promoter .
These insertions created 1/2 , 1 , or 1 1/2 extra turns of the DNA helix between these two sites .
Fig .
3C shows that insertion of DNA between these two sites abolished LPS inducibility .
Identification of Transcription Factors That Bind to the Egr-1 , CRE , and « B3 Sites-EMSA were performed to determine which transcription factors bind to sites in regions I and II of the human TNF-a promoter .
Region I : Egr-1 and Sp1-An oligonucleotide containing only the Egr-1 site bound an LPS and phorbol ester-inducible complex ( Fig .
44 ) .
This complex was not observed when an oligonucleotide containing a mutant Egr-l1 site was used as the probe ( Fig .
4A , lanes 4-6 ) .
In addition , this LPS-inducible complex was supershifted by anti-Egr-1 antibody ( Fig .
4A , lane 9 ) , demonstrating that Egr-1 bound to this site .
A prominent complex was observed when nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells were incubated with an oligonucleotide spanning the overlapping Spl/Egr-1 sites ( -182 to -157 bp ) ( Fig .
4B , lane 1 ) .
This complex was not induced by LPS ( Zane 2 ) but was supershifted using an anti-Spl antibody ( Zane 3 ) .
In addition , this complex was not observed using an oligonucleotide containing a mutated Spl site ( Fig .
4B , lanes 5-8 ) .
Taken together , these results demonstrated that Spl bound to this site .
In addition to the constitutively expressed Spl complex , LPS stimulation of cells resulted in the formation of an Egr-1 complex that bound to the oligonucleotide containing overlapping Spl/Egr-1 sites ( Fig .
4B , lane 2 ) .
Similarly , this LPS inducible Egr-1 complex was observed using the Sp1 , , , , , /Egr-1 oligonucleotide as a probe ( Fig .

LPS induction of NF- « B ( p50/p65 ) .
Nuclear extracts from THP-1 ( A ) or peripheral blood monocytes ( B ) were probed with oligonucleotide spanning « B1 , « B2 , or « B3 site ( Table I ) .
C , nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies ( 2 ug ) for 20 min before adding probes .
was not affected by the addition of an anti-Spl antibody ( Fig .

Region II : « B3 and CRE-EMSA were performed with oligonucleotides spanning three putative kB sites : « Bl ( -594 to -577 ) , « B2 ( -216 to -199 ) , and « B3 ( -104 to -87 ) ( Table I ) .
As depicted in Fig .
5A , LPS stimulation of cells resulted in the formation of nuclear protein-DNA complexes with kB1l ( Zane 2 ) and « B3 ( Zane 6 ) , but not with xB2 ( Zane 4 ) .
More protein bound to « B1 that B3 .
Similar results were found using nuclear extracts from human peripheral blood monocytes ( Fig .
5B ) .
Monospecific anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies were used in supershift experiments to identify the protein composition of the complexes formed with the « B1 and « B3 sites .
As shown in Fig .
5C , the LPS induced complex binding either to the kB1 or to the « B3 oligonucleotides were supershifted by anti-p50 and also by anti-p65 antibodies ( Fig .
5C ) , indicating that they were composed of p50/p65 heterodimers .
Furthermore , mutation of the « B3 site ( « B3 m2 , Table I ) abolished binding of p50/p65 ( data not shown ) .
Importantly , the same mutation significantly reduced LPS inducibility of the TNF-a promoter ( Fig .
2 ) .
Using a prototypic CRE site as a probe , we demonstrated that CREB was constitutively expressed in unstimulated THP-1 cells and that CREB binding was not induced by LPS ( Fig .
6A ) .
In contrast , LPS stimulation increased the amount of protein binding to the non-consensus CRE site from the TNF-a promoter ( Fig .

Antibody supershift experiments were performed to determine the proteins that bound to the CRE site ( Fig .

LPS induction of nuclear factors binding to CRE site .
Nuclear extracts from unstimulated or LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were probed with oligonucleotide probe spanning the prototypic CRE sequence ( A ) , TNF-a promoter wild type CRE sequence ( B ) , or mutant CRE sequence ( CREm2 , C ) .
Sequences of these oligonucleotides are shown in Table I .
For antibody supershift experiments , nuclear extracts were incubated with various antibodies ( 2 ug ) for 20 min before adding probes .
majority of the complex was supershifted using an anti-CREB antibody , whereas only a minor supershift was observed using an anti-c-Jun antibody .
In LPS-stimulated cells , the anti-c-Jun antibody supershift the majority of the complex , whereas the anti-CREB antibody formed a minor supershift band .
These results suggest that LPS does not increase the binding of CREB , consistent with our results using a prototype CRE site ( Fig .
6A ) , and that LPS increases binding of c-Jun-containing complexes to the CRE site from the TNF- « promoter .
Using an oligonucleotide containing a mutated CRE site ( CREm2 , Table I ) , we observed a reduction in the total amount of protein binding ( Fig .
6C , lane 2 ) .
In addition , LPS stimulation did not increase complex formation ( Zane 3 ) .
This complex was supershifted by an anti-CREB antibody ( lane 4 ) but was not recognized by an anti-c-Jun antibody ( lane 5 ) , suggesting that small amounts of CREB still bound to the mutated CRE site .
Since these same base substitutions completely abolished the functional activity of the CRE site in transfected cells ( Fig .
3B ) , these results provide additional evidence that c-Jun-containing complexes , rather than CREB , play a crucial role in LPS induction of the TNF-a promoter .
DISCUSSION In this report , we have defined two cis-acting regulatory elements in the human TNF- « promoter that mediated maximal LPS induction of TNF-a gene expression in cells of monocytic lineage .
Region I contained an overlapping Spl/Egr-1 site ( -182 to -162 ) , whereas region II ( -120 to -96 ) contained CRE and « B sites .
Functional studies demonstrated that Egr-1 binding to region I was required for LPS induction of the TNF-a promoter in monocytes .
Egr-1 protein expression was induced by LPS stimulation ( 21 ) .
The Egr-1 site at -169 bp is part of the Sp1/Egr-1 overlapping sequence motif .
In unstimulated monocytes , Spl 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 17800 binds to this site , whereas upon LPS stimulation it is likely that Egr-1 displaces Spl to mediate induction of TNF-a promoter activity .
Previously , we have shown that Egr-1 can displace Spl from a similar overlapping Spl/Egr-1 site ( 22 ) .
The role of Spl bound to this upstream Spl site at -172 is un-known , although our results using a plasmid containing a mutation in the Spl site suggest that it does not mediate basal expression .
In contrast , mutation of the Spl site at -56 bp dramatically reduces basal expression by 65 % . ''
Further functional studies showed that the CRE and « B3 sites in region II were required for LPS induction of the TNF-a promoter .
We demonstrated that « B3 ( -97 ) bound p50/p65 heterodimers .
In contrast , we found no role for « B1 ( -588 ) despite its ability to bind p50/p65 .
A recent study by Trede et al .
( 11 ) also showed a role for « B3 in LPS induction of the TNF-a promoter in THP-1 cells .
However , these investigators did not identify other regulatory regions , possibly due to the low level of induction ( about 4-fold ) of the TNF- « promoter ( 11 ) .
In addition , our studies are in agreement with an earlier report ( 16 ) , showing that p50/p65 binds with much less avidity to « B3 than « B1 ( Fig .
5 ) .
Therefore , it is possible that protein-protein interaction of p50/p65 with c-Jun proteins bound to the adjacent CRE site is required to stabilize the formation of a transcriptional complex that mediates induction of the TNF-a promoter .
In monocytic cells , the CRE site in the TNF-a promoter constitutively bound CREB ( Fig .
6 ) .
Upon LPS stimulation , the amount of CREB binding remains unchanged , but there was a marked increase in c-Jun binding .
LPS induces c-jun expression ( 23 ) , suggesting that the increases in c-Jun-containing complexes observed in this study were due to de novo protein synthesis .
Furthermore , the transactivating activity of these c-Jun complexes may be increased due to post-translational phosphorylation ( 24 ) .
As reported recently , LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells resulted in rapid activation of JNK ( 25 ) .
The phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK significantly enhances the transactivation potential of these factors ( 26 ) .
The non-consensus CRE sequence of TNF-a promoter TGAGCTCA was shown to have a lower binding affinity for c-Jun/ATF-2 complex than a consensus CRE sequence ( 27 ) .
These variations of sequences and the resulting variation in binding of these bZIP proteins could play a role in the modulation of TNF-a expression in response to various signals .
Importantly , base substitution in the CRE site that reduced CREB binding but abolished c-Jun binding abrogated the functional activity of this site , suggesting that c-Jun-containing complexes bound to region II are required for LPS induction of the TNF-a promoter .
The molecular mechanisms by which binding of the nuclear proteins at this CRE site regulate the activation of TNF-a gene expression await further elucidation .
Parallel to our findings for monocytic cells , it was demonstrated recently that both the « B3 site and the adjacent upstream CRE site are required for the calcium-stimulated TNF-a transcription in human T cells ( 4 ) .
However , in contrast to our data for monocytes , these investigators reported that the site bound NFATp and not p50/p65 ( 28 ) .
Moreover , contrary to our findings in monocytes , no constitutive or induced CREB protein binding to the CRE site was observed in T cells ( 4 ) .
Instead , the CRE-binding complex was shown to consist almost exclusively of c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimers .
Furthermore , both the CRE site and adjacent upstream Ets site were essential for both basal promoter activity in T cells and responsiveness to PMA ( 5 ) .
It appears that the Ets site did not play a significant role in basal TNF-a promoter activity in monocytes , since it was not affected by mutation of the Ets * J. Yao and S.-T .

LPS Induction of TNF-a Promoter in Human Monocytes site . ''
Together , these results demonstrate the marked difference in the regulation of the TNF-a promoter in human T cells and monocytes .
In this study , we showed that LPS induction of a heterologous promoter by region II required both the CRE and « B3 sites , suggesting a functional cooperation between the transcription factors bound to these sites .
Similar cooperation has also been demonstrated in the induction of another cytokine gene , IFN- $ ( 29 ) , as well as in the expression of E-selectin ( 30 ) .
In both cases , ATF-2/Jun proteins were shown to interact with p50/p65 proteins .
In addition , p50/p65 has been shown to physically interact with ATF-2 ( 29 ) , and c-Jun ( 31 ) .
These direct associations are considered an important mechanism by which transcriptional factors cooperate to induce gene expression .
The novel findings presented here support the notion that concerted participation of proteins bound to the Egr-1 , CRE , and « B3 sites mediates the induction of the TNF-a promoter in human monocytic THP-1 cells in response to LPS .
Future studies will determine if similar regulatory pathways control TNF-a gene expression in monocytes and macrophages .
Further elucidation of the cooperative interactions of transcription factors bound to these cis-acting regulatory elements are essential to our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the TNF-a gene in human monocytes .
Understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which these nuclear factors regulate TNF-a gene expression should lead to design of specific inhib-itors that will counteract the pathological effects of TNF-a in various diseases .
