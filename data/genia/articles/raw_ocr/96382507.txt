Darnell , Jr. , The Rockefeller University , New York , NY , May 20 , 1996 ( received for review March 1 , 1996 ) ABSTRACT Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV ) protease in cultured cells leads to apoptosis , preceded by cleavage of bel-2 , a key negative regulator of cell death .
In contrast , a high level of bel-2 protects cells in vitro and in vivo from the viral protease and prevents cell death following HIV infection of human lymphocytes , while reducing the yields of viral structural proteins , infectivity , and tumor necrosis factor & .
We present a model for HIV replication in which the viral protease depletes the infected cells of bel-2 , leading to oxidative stress-dependent activation of NFKB , a cellular factor required for HIV transcription , and ultimately to cell death .
Purified bel-2 is cleaved by HIV protease between phenylalanine 112 and alanine 113 .
The results suggest a new option for HIV gene therapy ; bel-2 muteins that have non-cleavable alterations surrounding the HIV protease cleavage site .
Loss of immunocompetent lymphocytes , as well as other cell types , is the hallmark of progressive infection by HIV .
Lymphocytes infected in vitro soon die by the process of apoptosis and cells taken from HIV-infected people proceed to apoptotic death when placed in culture ( 1 , 2 ) .
Examination of biopsy or autopsy material from HIV-infected people reveals apoptosis coincident with or adjacent to infected cells ( 3 ) .
There are reports of the HIV gene products tat and gp120 having cytotoxic or apoptotic effects , but usually a secondary stimulus must be included , such as serum factor depletion or addition of cell surface antibodies ( 4 ) .
In comparison , Krausslich ( 5 ) reported direct toxic effects following expression of the HIV aspartic protease in cultured cells .
We have examined HIV protease-expressing cells in greater detail , and observe structural changes characteristic of apoptosis , a typical ladder-like DNA fragmentation pattern and depression of the signal from cellular enzymatic reporters ( 6 , 7 ) .
Preceding cell death , bel-2 , a key negative regulator of apoptosis ( 8 ) is cleaved by the viral protease .
We describe the sites in bel-2 hydrolyzed by HIV protease and show that a circuit exists between virus protease-mediated loss of bel-2 and activation of NFkB , a redox-sensitive transcription factor required for HIV replication .
In contrast , in lymphocytes over-producing bel-2 , we report down-regulation of NFKB-containing sequences , specifically the HIV long terminal repeat and tumor necrosis factor « ( TNF-a ) , leading to a cytoprotective and antiviral effect against HIV .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION HIV Protease Causes Apoptosis in Cultured Cells .
Following transfection of a plasmid coding for the HIV protease , fibroblast , epithelial , and lymphocyte cell lines die ( Fig .
1 ) .
The death pattern is apoptotic in appearance with cell rounding , chromatin condensation , formation of cytoplasmic vesicles , and blebbing , accompanied by characteristic DNA laddering .
Inhibition of HIV protease-mediated apoptosis is accomplished by addition of the HIV protease inhibitor DMP323 ( 14 ) , or by treating the cells with interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) , stem cell factor , or pentoxifylline , a cytoprotectant that has metal chelating and anti-NFB properties ( 15 , 16 ) .
Similar treatments also suppress replication of HIV ( 16 , 17 ) .
The level of HIV protease detected after transfection is similar to the quantity of protease found in HIV-infected cells , as estimated from Western blot analysis ( not shown ) .
bel-2 Is Cleaved by HIV Protease .
We observed no changes to most cellular proteins in the protease-expressing cells when we employed one and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses ( Fig .
2 ) , although there have been several reports of cellular cytoskeletal proteins serving as HIV protease substrates in cell-free experiments ( reviewed in ref .
18 ) .
However , a cellular protein that is cleaved is bel-2 , a key negative regulator of apoptosis .
When we examined the stability of endogenous bel-2 in cell-free extracts or cells exposed to HIV protease , we saw a loss of full-size ( 26 kDa ) bel-2 and the appearance of proteolytic fragments ; the predominant ones having apparent molecular sizes of approximately 12-14 Proc .

Lanes 1-4 : Western blot detection of bel-2 cleavage products .
Lane 1 , recombinant bel-2 in extract of baculovirus-infected Sf21 insect cells ; lane 2 , Sf21 lysate incubated with 50 ng of HIV protease ; lane 3 , COS-7 cells transfected with bel-2 for 24 h ; lane 4 , bel-2 and HIV protease cotransfected in COS-7 cells ( 24 h ) .
Lane 5 , bel-2 marker ; silver stain detection of purified HIV protease ( lane 6 ) , purified bel-2 ( lane 7 ) , bel-2 and HIV protease ( lane 8 ) incubated in assay buffer at 37°C for 4 h. Efficient recovery of recombinant bel-2 from baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells was dependent on exposure of the protein to 6 M GdnHCl .
As a control for possible misfolding of the bel-2 used in lanes 7 and 8 , microsome bound *5S-Met-bcl-2 was cleaved by HIV protease .
Lane 9 , °S-Met-bcl-2 ; lane 10 , °S-Met-bet-2 plus HIV protease .
Lanes 11-15 , human MT-2 lymphocytes infected with HIV , strain Rf ( 0.5 infectious unit per cell ) .
Bcl-2 levels were detected by Western blot analysis as described above .
Lane 11 , uninfected cells .
Lanes 12-15 ; 6 , 17 , 24 , 48 h post-infection , respectively .
Lane 16 , bel-2 marker .
Lanes 17 and 18 compare the total proteins in COS-7 cells without and with expression of HIV protease .
No gross differences were observed using one- or two-dimensional gels , or by Western blotting with antibodies against a variety of proteins involved in DNA repair , the cytoskeleton , or cellular enzymes .
Amino acids identified in sequence after hydrolysis of bei-2 by HIV protease are : alanine , 85 pmol ; glutamate , 100 pmol ; methionine , 72 pmol ; serine , 20.5 pmol ; serine , 2 pmol ; glutamine , 48.2 pmol ; and leucine , 38.6 pmol , consistent with cleavage between phenylalanine 112 and alanine 113 .
Also detected were minor cleavages between amino acids 15 and 16 , 27 and 28 , and 97 and 98. kDa ( Fig .
2 , lanes 1-5 ) .
Purified bel-2 and bel-2 translated in reticulocyte lysates , after exposure to HIV protease , were cleaved into similar 12-14-kDa products ( Fig .
2 , lanes 6-10 ) .
Also shown in Fig .
2 , lanes 11-15 , is the time-dependent loss of bel-2 , which occurs in lymphocytes after infection with HIV ( 19 ) , although discrete cleavage products were not consistently observed .
In comparison , in cells overproducing HIV protease , there was no detectable change in the majority of cellular proteins ( Fig .
2 , lanes 17 and 18 ) .
Acute loss of bel-2 by proteolysis has not been previously associated with apoptosis ( 20 ) .
Gradually reducing the intracellular level of bel-2 message with antisense technology leads to onset of apoptosis , with a 24-48 h lag , as the endogenous bel-2 protein level slowly declines ( 20 ) .
In transgenic mice in which the bel-2 gene is interrupted , the surviving progeny progressively lose their lymphocytes within 4 weeks after birth ( 21 ) .

in which bei-2 cleavage mediated by HIV protease induced apoptosis , we found in parallel experiments that antisense to bel-2 also caused death , although the initial apoptotic features were delayed by 12-24 h. Expression of HIV Protease and Loss of bel-2 Leads to Oxidative Stress and NFB Activation .
The mechanism of cytoprotection by bel-2 is not clear , but may involve suppression of cellular production of reactive oxygen species or protection from such molecules ( 8 , 22 ) .
In contrast , transcription of HIV is induced by reactive oxygen species ( 11 , 23 ) .
We therefore tested if the expression of HIV protease affects intracellular oxidative status .
Following protease expression , the intracellular concentration of glutathione is decreased , the level of lipid peroxidation increased , the DNA binding property of NFB activated and TNF increased ( Table 1 ) .
These effects , which can be partially mimicked in cells treated with bel-2 antisense ( Table 1 ) , are each known to potentiate HIV transcription , and have been observed in clinical AIDS ( 11 , 23 ) .
Although we can not absolutely prove cause and effect , the cleavage and depletion of bel-2 by HIV protease is consistent with loss of its claimed antioxidant function .
Protective Effect of bel-2 Against HIV Protease Toxicity .
The anti-apoptosis protein of adenovirus , Elb-19k , protects Jurkat T cells against the cytopathic effect of HIV ( 24 ) .
We therefore examined the ability of bel-2 to protect cells from HIV and the viral protease .
As shown in Fig .
3 , there is effective protection from the protease if a plasmid expressing bel-2 is present in the cells .
In lymphocytes , loss of a luciferase reporter signal caused by coexpression of HIV protease is prevented if bel-2 is simultaneously overexpressed .
Similarly , lymphocytes expressing bel-2 do not become apoptotic when infected by HIV , and in contrast to earlier results with the adenovirus protein Elb-19k ( 24 ) , HIV infectivity titers are reduced by up to 90 % , as are the levels of viral p24 core and gp120 envelope proteins , the number of syncytia , and the quantity of TNF released into the medium ( Fig .
3 ) .
These results provide additional evidence that above a threshold level of bel-2 , transcription of NFKB-activated promoters , such as the HIV long terminal repeat , TNF and p53 ( 11 , 16 , 23 ) are suppressed .
Bel-2 was reported to protect cultured mammalian cells against the cytopathic effects of influenza virus ( 25 ) and sindbis virus ( 26 ) , possibly by inhibiting NFKB activation ( 27 ) .
The experiments so far describe results only in cultured cells .
To test whether bel-2 expression is protective in vivo , we Table 1 .

( d ) Bel-2 protects human MT-2 lymphocytes from HIV protease cytotoxicity and reduces yields of HIV components and TNF .
Firefly luciferase ( luc ) was expressed alone ( control = 100 % , not shown ) , with HIV protease ( top bar ) , or with HIV protease and bei-2 ( second bar ) .
Compared with luciferase control , at 24 h HIV protease reduced the yield of luciferase activity to approximately 25 % , whereas bel-2 protected the cells so that more than 75 % of control luciferase activity was recovered .
For plotting the lower six bars , determinations were made with HIV-infected lymphocytes overproducing bel-2 .
These were compared with unshown controls ( =100 % ) representing infected cells with no exogenous bel-2 present .
MT -2 cells were infected with HIV-1 virus , strain Rf ( shown ) or HXB2 at a multiplicity of 0.5-1 infectious unit per cell .
Levels of p24 , gp120 , and TNF were measured by standard immunoassays .
HIV infectivity was determined using a plaque assay and syncytia counted among 10° cells using a phase contrast microscope .
DNA degradation was assayed as described .

However , cointroduction of the bel-2 expression plasmid protects the luciferase signal by up to 75 % , as does the synthetic HIV protease inhibitor DMP323 .
These results show that bel-2 is able to protect cells in vivo against the viral protease .
Determination of Sites in bel-2 Cleaved by HIV Protease .
Inhibitors of the HIV protease were able to block cytotoxicity of the enzyme as well as virus-induced apoptosis ( refs .
5 and 14 , Fig .
1 , Table 2 ) .
However , HIV protease self-processing and cleavage of HIV core proteins were not inhibited in bel-2-expressing cells , indicating that HIV protease action per se is not directly lethal .
Instead , the cells must be responding to the loss of bei-2 to enter the apoptotic pathway .
Therefore , a novel cytoprotective approach could result from installing a modified gene in cells coding for a bel-2 mutein that was less susceptible to cleavage by HIV protease .
Before initiating such an approach , it was necessary to determine the site ( s ) in bel-2 cleaved by HIV protease .
Purified bel-2 was reacted with homogeneous HIV protease and newly generated amino-termini determined by automated sequence analysis .
Results are summarized in the Fig .
2 legend .
The primary cleavage event occurs between phenylalanine 112 and alanine 113 , and the sequence of amino acids ( RDFAEM ) surrounding the cleavage site comprise a high-affinity HIV protease target ( 28 ) .
The cleavage products are predicted to be a 12-kDa amino- and a 14-kDa carboxy- terminus , consistent with the results in Fig .
2 .
The phenylalanine at position 112 is conserved for bei-2 homologues throughout evolution , including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( 8 ) , and a recent mutagenesis study assigned a functional role to human bel-2 amino acids 108-114 in preventing apoptosis ( 29 ) .
A protein in the extended bel-2 family lacking phenylalanine in the homologous position is bax , a positive regulator of apoptosis that dimerizes with bel-2 ( 8 ) , and bax is not cleaved in HIV protease-expressing or HIV-infected cells ( not shown ) .
Because the ratio of bel-2 to bax following HIV infection thus shifts to bax excess , cell death by apoptosis should be the expected result .
We have shown that a tactic that HIV uses to upregulate its transcription , namely proteolytic attack on bel-2 , has the consequence of being cytocidal .
This is different from many other viruses , which often code for proteins that prevent apoptosis and keep the captured cellular apparatus functioning as long as possible ( 24 ) .
HIV may have evolved a unique strategy based on apoptosis ; the corpses of post-apoptotic HIV-infected lymphocytes are proposed to be engulfed by monocytes , which then become chronically infected by the ingested proviral DNA ( 30 ) .
Monocytes/macrophages are thought to serve as important reservoirs and transporters of the HIV provirus to distant organs of the host .
Because the viral protease is central to this ( 31 , 32 ) , inhibition of virus maturation by protease inhibitors would seem to provide the additional benefits of minimizing cell loss ( 33 , 34 ) , reducing transcription of the viral genome , and preventing activation of cellular genes that may play a role in the pathology of AIDS .
A new approach , coming from the results given in Fig .
2 , is to modify bel-2 to decrease its susceptibility to the action of HIV protease , while retaining biological ( anti-apoptotic ) function , Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 93 ( 1996 ) 9575 and we have initiated those studies .
Also worth exploring are ways to upregulate expression of the endogenous bel-2 gene or one of its anti-apoptotic relatives , preferably selectively in HIV-infected cells .
IL-10 , stem cell factor , and other cytokines that increase bel-2 levels ( 35 , 36 ) , NFB pathway inhibitors such as pentoxifylline and thalidomide , and a variety of chemical antioxidants that inhibit HIV and may reduce cell death are currently in early clinical trials for AIDS ( 16 , 17 , 23 , 37 ) .
