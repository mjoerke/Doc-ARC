Two sets of independent evidences are presented here that demonstrate a biological relevance for this model .
First , we describe results demonstrating that mice inoculated with T-antigen-expressing plasmids produced antibodies , not only to T-antigen and DNA , but also to the DNA-binding eukaryotic transcription factors TATA-binding protein ( TBP ) , and to the cAMP -response-element-binding protein ( CREB ) .
Secondly , we investigated whether polyomavirus reactivation occurs in SLE patients , and whether antibodies to T-antigen , DNA , and to TBP and CREB are linked to such events .
Both within and among these SLE patients , frequent polyomavirus reactivations were observed that could not be explained by certain rearrangements of the noncoding control regions , nor by corticosteroid treatment .
Linked to these events , antibodies to T-antigen , DNA , TBP , and CREB were detected , identical to what we observed in mice .
Antibodies recognizing double-stranded DNA were confined to patients with frequent polyomavirus reactivations .
The results described here indicate that cognate interaction of B cells recognizing DNA or DNA-associated proteins and T cells recognizing T antigen had taken place as a consequence of complex formation between T ag and DNA in vivo in the context of polyomavirus reactivations .

The antibodies are oligoclonal , somatically mutated , and their V regions contain structures that are selected by , and favor binding to , dsDNA ( 7 , 8 ) .
Highly similar SLE-related antiDNA antibodies ( with regard to specificity and structure of their V-regions ) can be experimentally induced by artificial DNA-polypeptide complexes ( 9-11 ) .
During recent years , we developed an experimental model that allowed us to investigate the role and origin of one DNA-binding protein as a molecular basis for rendering DNA immunogenic .
In a series of experiments using intact polyomavirus particles or viral DNA-protein complexes as immunogens , all animals responded by producing anti-DNA antibodies , some of which also bound to the supercoiled kinetoplast DNA of Crithidia luciliae ( 12 ) , demonstrating a specificity for dsDNA ( for review see reference 13 ) .
Recently , we presented evidence that a linked immune response to ssDNA , dsDNA , and histones , relied on the DNA-binding property of the virus-encoded T-antigen transcription factor ( T-ag ) ' ( 14 ) .
The experimental systems described so far have , therefore , provided insight into the hitherto unresolved problem of how DNA may be rendered immunogenic .
The structural basis for the development of such antibodies in vivo has , however , not been identified .
The experimental polyomavirus model for induction of antibodies to DNA and dsDNA may also prove useful in this context .
The majority of human individuals harbor silent polyomavirus infections for their lifetimes ( 15 , 16 ) .
Normally , virus reactivations are rare .
Little is known about the cell tropism for polyomaviruses , but the kidneys seem to be the major focus , both for primary infection , and also for reactivations ( 17 ) .
During such events , virus particles are shedded in the urine .
Performing PCR using primers for viral DNA has therefore been widely used for detecting polyomavirus reactivations .
Thus , consecutive urine samples from humans may be assayed for viral DNA shedding , and serial serum samples may be assayed for development of anti-T-ag antibodies , reflecting the expression of the viral transcription factor T-ag .
The simultaneous presence of viral DNA sequences in urine samples and anti-T-ag antibodies in serum samples of individual patients may reflect virus reactivation .
In the present report , we performed two lines of experiments that demonstrate a central role for polyomavirus T-ag to give immunogenic potential to nucleosomal antigens .
In a first set of experiments , we inoculated Balb/C mice ( a ) with 1 .
Abbreviations used in this paper : CT , calf thymus ; CREB , cAMP response-element-binding protein ; NCCR , noncoding control region ; RF , rheumatoid factor ; T-ag , T-antigen ; TBP , TATA-binding protein .
Polyomaviruses and Autoimmunity to DNA in SLE __ 2045 plasmids encoding T-ag under the control of constitutive eukaryotic promoters , and ( b ) with control plasmids .
Previous similar experiments ( 14 ) have demonstrated the potential for T-ag to initiate the production of antibodies to T-ag , DNA , dsDNA , and histone antigens .
Here , we confirm these results , and extend the observations by including the detection of antibodies to the DNA-binding eukaryotic transcription factors TBP ( TATA-binding protein ) and CREB ( cAMP response-element-binding protein ) ( 18 , 19 ) .
These are novel , not previously described autoantibodies .
In a second set of observations , we have taken advantage of the fact that virtually all individuals are latently infected by polyomaviruses .
This allows us to investigate whether polyomavirus reactivation , initiated by active expression of the T-ag , is sufficient for initiating antibody production against the same set of autoantibodies as those detected in mice inoculated with T-ag-expressing plasmids .
In agreement with observations in mice inoculated with T-ag-expressing plasmids , antibodies to ssDNA , dsDNA , TBP , and CREB were , with one exception , confined to individuals demonstrating polyomavirus reactivations , as determined by PCR analyses of serial urine samples , and , linked to such events , by development of anti-T-ag antibodies .
By combining these independent results , we may now be able to envisage the following model representing one natural molecular bases for induction of SLE-related anti-DNA antibodies .
Silent ( latent ) polyomavirus infection may be terminated by expression of T-ag .
This termination may in turn result in the generation of complexes between T-ag and DNA , rendering DNA and DNA-associated self proteins like TBP and CREB immunogenic .
Methods Mice .
2-mo-old Balb/C mice were obtained from the Charles River Breeding Laboratories ( Sultzfeld , Germany ) , and were housed in the facilities of the Animal Research Department at the Institute of Medical Biology , University of Tromsg , Tromsg , Norway .
Plasmids .
The plasmids pReCMV-BLT , pReCMV-SLT , pRe-CMV-SLTissrss , and pBS-BLT have been characterized in detail elsewhere ( 14 ) .
Inoculation of plasmids .
Groups of five Balb/C mice were injected with a total of 100 pg of the individual plasmids per animal in both lumbar regions .
Sera were subsequently collected every second week over an 8-wk observation period , and were analyzed as described below .
Patients .
10 normal individuals and 6 RA patients were followed over 3 mo .
20 SLE patients , all fulfilling four or more of the Ameri- can Rheumatism Association ( ARA ) classification criteria for SLE ( 20 ) , participated in this study over approximately 1 yr .
The normal individuals and RA patients were related to the SLE patients with regard to race ( Caucasians ) , sex , and age .
Serum and urine samples .
Serum samples , collected at the begin-ning , and monthly thereafter from each normal individual , RA , or SLE patient throughout the observation period , were stored at -=70°C until they were analyzed for antibodies to T-ag , calf thymus ( CT ) ssDNA , CT dsDNA , TBP , CREB , and rheumatoid factor ( RF ) .
Urine samples ( 20 ml ) ( approximately one every second week if not otherwise stated in Table II ) were frozen by the patients at home and , upon arrival in the hospital , were stored at -70°C until they were examined by PCR .
From 32 normal and 36 RA patients , single urine samples were also collected .
PCR amplification of polyomavirus DNA sequences in urine samples .
All PCR tests were performed following the guidelines cited by Kwok ( 21 ) .
Preparation of the urine samples before PCR analyses has been described ( 22 ) .
For the detection of polyomavirus early gene sequences , the PYV for and PYV.rev primers were used ( 23 ) .
To amplify viral NCCR sequences , a nested PCR was performed .
Initially , 25 cycles were run with the primer set GPPY-1 and GPPY-2 , followed by 30 cycles with the BKTT-1 and BKTT-10 primers ( 24 , 25 ) .
Both primer sets are flanking the viral NCCR .
Under these condi-tions , 0.1 fg of polyomavirus early gene sequence could be detected ( 17 genome equivalents ) .
To control negative PCR test results , a parallel sample of each PCR-negative urine specimen was amplified with the addition of 1 fg of BK virus DNA .
Amplified bands of expected size allowed the conclusion that PCR-negative urine samples are truly negative .
To distinguish between polyomavirus BK or JC NCCR , PCR products were digested with PfimI , Bsu36I and SacI ( 24-26 ) .
Sequencing the NCCR .
Amplified NCCRs were sequenced twice by the dideoxy method ( 27 ) as described in detail elsewhere ( 22 ) .
Antigens .
The source and preparation of T-ag , CT ssDNA , and CT dsDNA has been described previously ( 14 , 28 ) .
The transcription factors TBP and CREB were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnol-ogy , Inc. ( San Diego , CA ) .
TBP is a full-length human protein prepared as a glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) fusion protein in Escherichia coli , while CREB is a 10-14-kD DNA-binding domain ( CREB-1 ) of the 43-kD full-length human protein .
TBP and CREB were > 98 % pure according to the manufacturers , and were virtually free from contaminating proteins according to SDS-PAGE ( data not shown ) .
Indirect solid phase ELISA .
For detection of antibodies to CT ssDNA , CT dsDNA , and T-ag , the ELISA tests were performed as described previously ( 14 , 28 ) .
The CT ssDNA used as ELISA antigen binds both anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies .
In the CT dsDNA ELISA , specificity for dsDNA was ascertained by the absence of binding of the monoclonal anti-ssDNA antibody 111-185 ( 29 ) , while the monoclonal anti-dsDNA antibody DNAG6 ( 8 ) bound to this antigen .
For detection of antibodies to TBP and CREB , microtiter plates ( Nunc Maxisorp ; Intermed Nunc , Copenhagen , Denmark ) were coated with TBP or CREB at a concentration of 1 pg/ml in PBS .
For these tests , serum samples were diluted twofold from 1/100 to 1/ Table I .

3200 in PBS ( 0.05 % Tween-20 ) .
To ascertain that serum antibodies actually bound to TBP , and not to its fusion partner GST , the sera were tested in control wells coated with GST in PBS at a concentration of 1 pg/ml .
These ELISAs were processed exactly as described for the other tests .
For all ELISA tests , only Ig antibodies were ana-lyzed , using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human Ig .
Titers of the antibodies were determined as described previously ( 14 ) .
The ELISA tests were processed using the fully automated Behring ELISA processor III ( Behringwerke AG , Frankfurt a .
Main , Germany ) .
Crithidia luciliae .
The test for detection of antibodies to dsDNA was performed as described elsewhere ( 12 ) .
Detection of RF .
This was done by a nephelometric method using a Nephelometer-Analyzer ( Behring , Marburg , Germany ) .
The results are given as IU/ml , using the reference standards supplied by the manufacturer .
Values = 11 IU/ml are regarded as negative .
Statistics .
Statistical testing was done using the two-way analysis of variance with patients ' number , group ( I-IV ) , and multiple regression analyses as factors .
SAS software was used ( SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , NC ) .
Results T-ag expression in plasmid-inoculated mice .
Groups of five mice were given a single injection of plasmids encoding wild-type T-ag from polyomavirus BK ( pReCMV-BLT ) , SV40 virus ( pReCMV-SLT ) , or the mutant SV40 T-ag ( pReCMV-SLT This latter mutant T-ag , due to replacement of one amino acid at position 155 , has lost its ability to bind DNA se-quence-specifically , but has retained a weak , sequence nonspe-cific affinity for DNA ( 30 ) .
Sera collected every second week over an 8-wk period , were assayed for Ig antibodies to T-ag .
While all preimmune sera from these mice were negative for anti-T-ag antibodies , this antibody increased over the observation time ( Fig .
1 , A-C ) , and sera drawn after 8 wk contained high titers of anti-T-ag antibodies , indicating that T-ag was expressed in vivo ( Table I ) .
Sera from mice inoculated with the plasmid containing the gene encoding BK virus T-ag , but lacking an eukaryotic promoter ( pBS-BLT ) , were negative for anti-T-ag antibodies ( Fig .
1 A ) .
T-ag expression and initiation of antibodies to DNA and the transcription factors TBP and CREB .
The mice that received the plasmids expressing wild-type T-ag from BK or SV40 virus , but not those inoculated with the pBS-BLT plasmid , developed Ig antibodies to ssDNA , TBP , and CREB simultaneously with the initiation of anti-T-ag antibodies ( Table I , and Fig .
1 , A-B ) .
In mice injected with the plasmid encoding the mutant T-ag , antibodies to T-ag and to TBP developed in a similar way ( Table I , Fig .
1 C ) .
However , in only three out of the five mice , anti-CREB antibodies were detected at titers > 100 ( Table I ) .
In the two other mice , weak reactivity to CREB was also detected ( Fig .
1 C ) , but the strength was below the level necessary to reach a titer at a 1/100 serum dilution .
None of these mice produced anti-DNA antibodies above this thresh-old , although weak reactivities could also be detected for this specificity ( Fig .
1 C ) in agreement with previous results ( 14 ) .
Antibodies to IgG ( RF ) were not detected in any of these sera , indicating that the responses to the other antigens are the result of antigen-selective B cell stimulation .
Correlation between T-ag expression in vivo and immune responses to DNA , dsDNA , TBP , and CREB in humans .
As indicated above , PCR-based detection of polyomavirus DNA sequences in urine samples , combined with development of Figure 1 .

Results are given as mean +SD of the absorbance at 492 nm , representing antibody binding at serum dilution 1/100 for all tests .
anti-T-ag antibodies , are regarded as evidence for polyomavirus reactivation .
These parameters were therefore selected to investigate whether the processes resulting in antibodies to T-ag , DNA , TBP , and CREB after experimental T-ag expression in mice reflect similar processes in humans , particularly in those with SLE .
Prevalence and frequency of human polyomavirus DNA sequences in urine samples from healthy individuals and RA patients .
Single urine samples from 32 healthy and 36 RA individuals were analyzed .

detected in any of these samples ( data not shown ) , while 43 % of urine samples from SLE patients were PCR-positive ( see below ) .
For the 10 normal individuals followed over 3 mo , none of the urine samples ( six from each patient ) contained polyomavirus DNA sequences .
None of the four serum samples from each of these individuals contained antibodies to T-ag , DNA , TBP , or CREB .
For the six RA patients followed over 3 mo , five were PCR- ( as well as serum antibody ) negative .
For one , however , four out of six urine samples were PCR-positive , and all serum samples from this patient contained anti bodies to T-ag , ssDNA , TBP , and CREB , with mean titers of 219 , 147 , 312 , and 289 , respectively ( data not shown ) .
Frequency and NCCR structure of polyomavirus DNA in serial urine samples from SLE patients .
For all PCR-positive urine samples , amplicons were obtained with the primer set complementary to T-ag-encoding DNA sequences and to sequences flanking NCCR .
Based on the frequency of urine samples containing polyomavirus DNA sequences , the patients were divided into four groups ( Table II ) .
Group I encompassed patients 7 , 11 , 19 , and 21 , whose urine samples were negative for polyomavirus DNA throughout the observation period .
In group II ( patients 9 and 13 ) , one single PCR-positive urine sample was identified for each of the patients .
Patients demonstrating few PCR-positive urine samples were clustered in group III , with patient 2 having two PCR-positive urine samples out of 22 ( 9 % ) , and patient 4 having seven out of 33 ( 21 % ) .
About 30-100 % of the urine samples of the remaining 12 patients ( group IV ) were PCR-positive ( Table II ) .
Of the total number of urine samples in this group , 74 % were PCR-positive , compared to 43 % for all SLE patients .
The frequency and distribution of PCR-positive urine samples of patients representative for groups I-IV are depicted in Fig .
2 .
The high prevalence of polyomavirus DNA in the urine of SLE patients could theoretically be explained by the selection of virus strains with certain NCCRs known to dispose for reactivation ( 15 , 31 ) .
Duplication of P-blocks ( 31 ) of BK virus NCCR have been particularly ascribed this effect .
The sequences of these NCCRs ( Table III ) , however , were almost identical to those of the archetypal polyomavirus BK ( 31 ) or JC ( 24 ) , in agreement with restriction enzyme patterns of the amplified NCCR ( data not shown ) .
These sequences except the one in patient 2 , that contained an unreported BK virus NCCR ( denoted AO ) , are all found among normal individuals .
Corticosteroid treatment and polyomavirus reactivations .
As the strong tendency for virus reactivation could not be explained by selection of certain transcriptional active NCCRs , treatment of the patients with steroid hormones , which have been shown in vitro to increase the permissivity of cells for BK virus ( 32 ) , could alternatively account for the enhanced productive polyomavirus infection among these patients .
This can not , however , be the explanation for the strong tendency for polyomavirus reactivations , as SLE patients 8 , 12 , 14 , 23 , and 24 , all with frequent reactivations , did not receive corticoste-roids during the observation period .

Anti-T-ag antibodies related to detection of viral DNA sequences in urine samples from SLE .
Detection of polyomavirus DNA corresponding to T-ag encoding sequences by PCR did not prove the expression of large T-ag , which is considered essential for rendering DNA immunogenic ( 14 ) .
We therefore tested serial serum samples from each SLE patient for the presence of anti-T-ag antibodies , an indication of T-ag expression .
These antibodies were not detected in any serum sample from patients in group I ( Table II , Fig .
2 for patients 11 and 19 ) .
In sera of patients of group II , weak and transient anti-T-ag antibody response was detected in patient 13 ( Table II , Fig .
2 ) , preceded by the single episode of virus reactivation .
A similar result was also obtained for patient 9 , although critical serum samples were missing for this patient .
The last negative sample ( drawn at week 16 ) , however , preceding the PCR-positive serum sample ( week 22 ) , was followed by a serum sample at week 28 positive for anti-T-ag antibodies ( data not shown ) .
The course of this response could not be determined for this patient as the single PCR-positive urine sample appeared near the end of the observation time .
Thus , in patient 13 , and also possibly for patient 9 , we could directly determine an anti-T-ag antibody response preceded by a single episode of polyomavirus reactivation .
Both patients in group III had similar anti-T-ag responses ( Table II , Fig .
2 for patient 4 ) connected in time to the PCR-positive urine samples .
For patient 4 , the anti-T-ag response tient ; binding values are given as % of maximum binding of reference antibodies .
The ELISA results are given at serum dilution 1/100 for patient 11 , 1/200 for patients 13 and 4 , 1/500 for patient 19 , and 1/1000 for patient 5 .
For mean titers of the antibodies for the individual patients , see Table II .
The twofold dilution curves for the reference serum used for determination of titers of the individual antibodies is presented in the lower right panel .
The bars in the figure for patient 5 represent titers in the Crithidia luciliae test for this patient .
m T-ag # CT DNA & Albumin 400 1600 6400 26500 2-fold dilution of positive reference antibodies fluctuated above the baseline ( mean titer for the observation period was 217 ) , and the titer increased following episodes of viral DNA shedding .
A similar pattern , however less distinct because of weak anti-T-ag antibodies was observed for patient 2 ( data not shown ) .
For the remaining 12 patients ( group IV ) , strong and persistent production of antibodies to the T-ag , with mean titers ranging from 315 to 854 , was recorded ( Table II , Fig .
2 for patient 5 ) .
These data argue for the expression of the T-ag in these patients .
In agreement with these data , there was a strong positive correlation between frequencies of PCR-positive urine samples and mean titers of anti-T-ag antibodies ( Fig .
3 A , r = 0.86 , P < 0.0001 ) .
Likewise , there was an inverse relationship between the frequency of PCR-positive urine samples and coefficient of variance ( CV ) of the anti-T-ag titers in individual patients ( Table II ) , consistent with the idea that T-ag expression induced this antibody in vivo .
Thus , frequent or persistent expression of the T-ag resulted in high and stable titers ( as demonstrated by low CV ) of the anti-T-ag antibodies , as expected for an antibody induced by an acquired nonself antigen like the T-ag .
The relationship between polyomavirus DNA shedding , anti-T -ag antibodies , and development of anti-DNA antibodies in SLE patients .
In group I , anti-DNA antibodies could not be detected for patients 7 , 11 ( Fig .
2 A ) , and 21 ( Table II ) .
For Polyomaviruses and Autoimmunity to DNA in SLE __ 2049 patient 19 , however , strong and persistent anti-ssDNA response was observed , with titers ranging from 590 to 920 , mean titer 758 ( Table II , Fig .
2 ) .
For both patients in group II , antibodies to ssDNA were detected ( Table II ) .
In patient 13 , the virus reactivation , as determined by the combined detection of single PCR-positive urine samples and subsequent development of antibodies to T-ag , preceded the transient production of antibodies to DNA ( Fig .
2 ) .
Similarly , in patient 9 , antibodies to ssDNA increased simultaneously with antibodies to T-ag after the single PCR-positive urine sample appearing near the end of the observation period .
The course of this response could not be deter-mined .
Similar results were obtained for patients 2 and 4 in group III ( Table II ) .
Also , for these patients , production of antibodies to ssDNA were related in time to PCR-positive urine samples , and to the development of antibodies to T-ag with mean antiDNA titers of 11 ( ranging from 0-100 ) and 146 ( ranging from 100-190 ) for patients 2 and 4 , respectively ( Table II , Fig .
2 , patient 4 ) .
For patients in group IV , anti-ssDNA antibodies persisted at high levels throughout the observation period , with mean titers ranging from 207 to 956 ( Table II ) , similar to those observed for anti-T-ag antibodies .
Patients 5 , 12 , 14 , and 20 produced anti-dsDNA antibodies detectable by the Crithidia luciliae assay , with mean Crithidia titers of 64 , 33 , 20 , and 67 , respectively , over the observation time ( Fig .
2 for patient 5 ) .
These , and three additional patients ( 16 , 17 , and 25 ) in group IV produced anti-dsDNA antibodies detectable in an ELISA specific for dsDNA ( Fig .
3 C ) .
Thus , except for patient 19 , the presence of anti-DNA antibodies was limited to patients shedding polyomavirus DNA sequences in their urine , while antibodies with specificity for dsDNA were restricted to group IV patients .

The correlation coefficient ( r ) is indicated in each figure .
As for anti-T-ag antibodies , the mean anti-ssDNA titers correlated strongly with the frequency of PCR-positive urine samples ( Fig .
3 B , r = 0.747 , P < 0.0001 ) .
An inverse correlation between this frequency and CV of the mean anti-ssDNA titers was also established ( Table II ) , indicating that recurrent PCR-positive urine samples within single individuals of group IV reflect recurrent stimulation of the immune system consistent with high and stable anti-DNA antibody titers .
This , and the fact that there was a strong positive correlation between anti-T-ag and anti-ss DNA antibody titers in all patients at all time points ( Fig .
3 D , r = 0.733 , P < 0.0001 ) , strongly indicate that anti-DNA antibodies , as antibodies to the T-ag , are induced as a consequence of T-ag expression in vivo .
The strength of anti-dsDNA also increased with increasing frequency of polyomavirus reactivation ( Fig .
3 C , r = 0.60 ) , and there was a significant correlation between anti-dsDNA antibodies and their presence in group IV patients ( x2 = 7.18 , P < 0.01 ) .
The presence of RF in these patients did not correlate with polyomavirus reactivations , nor with presence of anti-T-ag antibodies from the following observations .
Only four of the 20 patients produced this autoantibody ( patient 21 in group I , and patients 8 , 16 and 23 in group IV ) .
Thus , in 9 out of the 12 patients in group IV , and in all patients belonging to group II or III , RF was not detected .
Among 112 other sera from autoimmune patients ( RA , Sjggren syndrome , and SLE ) , 39 contained antibodies to T-ag .
Of these , 8 ( 21 % ) were positive for RF , while 17 out of the 73 anti-T-ag negative sera ( 23 % ) contained RF ( r = 0.035 , P > 0.5 , data not shown ) .
Antibodies to TBP and CREB .
Because of small available amounts of TBP and CREB molecules , only sera with the highest levels of anti-T-ag and anti-DNA activities , together with randomly selected sera from SLE group I , were tested for antibodies against the transcription factors TBP and CREB .

Serum antibodies to TBP ( @ ) and GST ( O0 ) , ( A4 ) and CREB ( M , 3 ) are plotted against titers of anti-T-ag antibodies in selected sera from individual SLE patients .
The binding values ( OD 492 ) for antibodies to TBP and CREB are given at nonsaturating ( i.e. , 1/200 ) dilutions of the sera .
For patients 9 and 13 ( group II ) , serum antibodies to TBP ( @ ) and CREB ( ) before and after the single polyomavirus reactivations are demonstrated .
Binding values are given as OD 492 at twofold serum dilutions from 1/100 to 1/3200 .
As demonstrated in Fig .
4 , all anti-T-ag positive sera tested from groups II-IV ( in addition to the serum from patient 19 of group I ) were positive for anti-TBP ( Fig .
4 4 ) and anti-CREB ( Fig .
4 B ) antibodies .
In sera from group II patients ( 9 and 13 ) drawn before the virus expression episode ( week 10 and week 4 for patients 9 and 13 , respectively ) , no or weak anti-TBP and anti-CREB antibodies were detected .
Sera drawn after this time point ( week 28 and 8 , respectively ) , however , were increasingly positive in these tests ( Fig .
4 C ) .
These results strongly indicate that antibodies to TBP and CREB , like antibodies to DNA , were initiated as a consequence of T-ag expression .
This is consistent with the observation that all preimmune sera from plasmid-inoculated mice , and all sera of group II patients drawn before virus reactivations , were negative in the TBP and CREB ELISAs .
Not all sera contained antibodies to TBP and CREB ( e.g. , sera from patients 7 , 11 , 21 of group I ) , and 10 sera from group IV patients positive for such antibodies did not bind in an ELISA specific for GST ( Fig .
4 A ) .
These results argue against binding of serum antibodies to bacterial proteins contaminating the TBP and CREB prepa-rations , since this GST is also purified from E. coli .
Discussion In the present report we have investigated whether polyomaviruses have , in a natural situation , an ability to induce antibodies to DNA and DNA-associated self proteins similar to that previously observed in an experimental context in rabbits or mice ( 11-14 , 28 , 33 ) .
For these studies , we have taken advantage of the fact that virtually all human individuals are latently infected by such viruses .
The biological requirement for polyomaviruses to reactivate is fulfilled upon in vivo expression of the viral transcription factor T-ag .
Recently , we have demonstrated that expression of T-ag is sufficient to initiate the production of antibodies to DNA ( 14 ) .
Here , we have extended the observations on the immune responses to T-ag expression in mice to include detection of antibodies , not only to DNA , but also to the transcription factors TBP and CREB .
The TBP and TBP-associated factors form the multiprotein complex TFIID , which is part of the transcription preinitiation complex .
TBP is the only component of TFIID that binds directly to the TATA box of DNA ( 18 ) .
TBP is expressed in all cell types ( 18 ) .
In vitro studies have also demonstrated that TBP can interact with SV40 T-ag by direct pro-tein-protein interaction ( 34 ) .
CREB proteins , on the other hand , belong to a large family of related proteins which also includes the CREMs ( cAMP-response element modulators ) and the ATFs ( activating transcription factors ) .
Genes whose expression are regulated by the secondary messenger cAMP often contain the palindromic consensus sequence GTGAC-GTCA , the so-called cAMP response element ( CRE ) .
The CRE binding protein ( CREB ) binds constitutively to this sequence ( 19 ) .
It is not known whether CREB can bind T-ag .
Thus , both TBP and CREB bind directly to DNA or nucleosomes ( 18 , 34 ) .
It was therefore tempting to speculate that if T-ag binds DNA or nucleosomes ( 35 ) , not only DNA and his-tones ( 14 ) , but also DNA-associated polypeptides like TBP and CREB are rendered immunogenic as a consequence of T-ag expression and subsequent binding to DNA .
In mice inoculated with the plasmids encoding wild-type T-ags , strong immune responses to T-ag , DNA , TBP , and CREB were detected .
Sera from mice inoculated with the mutant T-ag-expressing plasmid contained strong antibodies to T-ag and to TBP , while the responses to DNA and CREB were less pronounced .
This mutant T-ag binds only weakly in a sequence-unspecific way to DNA , which may explain the weak DNA and anti-CREB responses in these mice ( Fig .
1 C ) .
Polyomaviruses and Autoimmunity to DNA in SLE __ 2051 These results contrast strikingly with the results for induction of anti-T-ag and anti-TBP antibodies obtained in the same mice , indicating that the mutant T-ag and TBP form a stable complex in vivo resulting in cognate interaction of TBP specific B-cells and T-ag specific T-cells .
These observations represented the rational bases for the present investigations designed to examine the extent of polyomavirus reactivations , and particularly T-ag expression , in SLE , and whether such reactivations reflect a natural biological origin for initiation of antibodies to DNA and to other nucleosome-associated antigens .
A prominent observation made was that of the high frequency of polyomavirus reactivations within and between SLE patients .
The NCCRs detected ( all except that for patient 2 ) belonged to the archetypal WW or CY of polyomavirus BK or JC , respectively , found among normal individuals .
Neither certain NCCR rearrangements nor administration of steroid hormones to the SLE patients ( see results ) could therefore explain the strong tendency for virus reactivations in these patients .
The linkage between viral DNA shedding and development of anti-T-ag antibodies strongly indicated that T-ag expression had taken place .
The anti-T-ag antibody profiles in individual SLE patients are thus representative for conventional immune responses to a foreign antigen , providing the ideal situation to compare directly a conventional and an assumed autoimmune anti-DNA response , both induced by the same nucleosome-T-ag complex ( 14 ) .
Analyzing the production of anti-DNA antibodies in individual patients demonstrated the validity of this approach .
Both the time points for their initiation and their profiles strongly indicated that anti-T-ag and anti-DNA antibody populations were temporally linked to each other and to polyomavirus reactivations for these patients .
For group IV patients , anti-T-ag and anti-ssDNA antibodies were produced persistently and at significantly higher levels than for group II and group III patients ( P < 0.05 ) .
Antibodies to dsDNA were exclusively detected in group IV patients .
Although there were individual variations in titers over the observation time , a significant correlation existed between the production of anti-T-ag and anti-DNA antibodies in all patients at all time points .
In group II patients , we could directly demonstrate that the virus reactivation preceded the development of these antibodies .
The data presented here therefore indicate a causal relationship between development of anti-ssDNA/dsDNA antibodies and expression of T-ag in context of polyomavirus reactivations in vivo .
Polyomaviruses infect almost 100 % of the human population ( 15 , 16 ) .
After primary infection , the virus remains silent , and reactivations of polyomaviruses seem to be rare events in normal individuals ( 36-40 ) .
Thus , from a total of 341 urine samples from normal individuals , or from individuals before transplantation ( taken from references 36-40 , and 92 urine samples from this study ) , polyomavirus DNA sequences were detected in seven ( 2.1 % ) .
Anti-T-ag antibodies have been detected in sera of 11 out of 1,240 cancer patients ( 0.9 % ) , and in 4 out of 501 normal control sera ( 0.8 % ) ( 41 ) .
As antibodies to T-ag are a relatively long-lasting and detectable demonstration of T-ag expression in vivo ( see Fig .
2 , patient 13 ) , these results also indicate that reactivations are rather rare both among and within normal individuals .
The opposite result is observed in HIV-infected individuals ( 22 , 42 , unpublished observations ) .
Interestingly , among such patients anti-dsDNA antibodies are 2052 - Rekvig et al .
detected by ELISA ( 43 ) or by the Crithidia test ( unpublished observations ) .
Polyomavirus reactivations may therefore explain development of anti-DNA antibodies generally , and not exclusively for SLE patients .
This is also demonstrated in the present report for one out of six RA patients .
Recurrent expression of polyomaviruses , typical for SLE , may for the following reasons also form the structural bases for the progressive generation of antibodies to dsDNA .
The specificity for dsDNA is determined by structural properties of the V-region of the Ig heavy chain , including arginines in the complementary determining region ( CDR ) III region ( 5 , 7 , 44 ) .
In autoimmune mice , such structures seem to result from progressive development of an early ssDNA antibody repertoire to include specificity for dsDNA ( 29 ) .
Thus , antibodies to ssDNA may serve as precursor antibodies for anti-dsDNA antibodies .
Compatible results have been obtained after extensive immunizations with CT DNA complexed with Fus1 ( 9 ) , or with polyomavirus BK ( 11 ) .
Intermittent or persistent T-ag expression in man may be a natural parallel to such experimental immunizations , creating the molecular bases for a continuous stimulation of B cells specific for DNA .
Through somatic mutations resulting in accumulation of structures predisposing for dsDNA binding ( like arginines in the CDR III of the Ig heavy chain ) , such antibodies may also obtain specificity for dsDNA ( 7 , 44 ) .
From this observation , one may predict that the processes responsible for initiation of antibodies to dsDNA may be the same as that responsible for initiation of antibodies to ssDNA .
Alternatively , continuous stimulation by DNA in an immunogenic form may also recruit B cells with an inherent specificity for dsDNA because of incomplete deletion of such cells ( 45 ) .
The fact that seven patients , all belonging to group IV , produced anti-dsDNA antibodies is consistent with these interpretations .
Sustained or recurrent expression of T-ag and subsequent binding to DNA may represent one molecular basis for such continuous stimulation of B-cells specific for DNA .
That other biologically active processes may be responsible for initiation of anti-DNA antibody responses have not been excluded ( see patient 19 of the present study ) .
T cells specific for histones , for example , may both initiate and maintain antiDNA antibody responses in SLE by processes similar to those described for T-ag , as indicated by recent results from Desai-Mehta et al .
( 46 ) .
These two systems are quite similar , however , with the principal difference being that in the polyomavirus model , T cells recognize a nonself protein ( T-ag ) , while in the system described by Desai-Mehta et al. , T cells recognize self proteins contained within the nucleosomes .
These two pathways are , however , not mutually exclusive , and may overlap each other within the same patient , or may substitute for each other in different SLE patients .
We can not entirely rule out that both anti-DNA antibodies and polyomavirus reactivations may independently arise from an underlying yet undefined proximal cause .
The consistent results obtained in an experimental context in mice and in a natural context in SLE patients , however , demonstrating a statistically highly significant association between antibodies to T-ag and to DNA , support the view that spontaneous expression of the virus alone represents one basic process for induction of anti-DNA autoantibody production .
The results described in this report are particularly attractive in light of the attempt to understand a biological origin of antibodies to DNA within a natural physiological context .
For a latent polyomavirus to reactivate , this process is initiated by active expression of the T-ag .
One consequence of this expression is binding to DNA , necessary for initiating transcriptional activity of virus genes .
A side effect is also binding to host DNA , thus forming a complex between host cell DNA and T-ag .
This process allows for cognate interaction of B cells specific for either of the components of nucleosomes ( i.e. , DNA and histones ) , or for molecules physically linked to this complex ( e.g. , transcription factors like TBP or CREB ) , and T-cells specific for T-ag , processed and presented by such B-cells .
T-ag may therefore serve as a latent biological basis for antiDNA antibody production .
The results presented here and previously ( 14 ) are consistent with this interpretation , and are compatible with the model suggested in a recent review ( 13 ) and by Radic and Weigert ( 5 ) .
