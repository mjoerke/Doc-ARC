The molecular basis for restricted cytokine expression by T helper 1 ( Th1 ) and T helper 2 ( Th2 ) cells is unclear .
Previous studies found that P1 , an element of the interleukin 4 ( IL-4 ) promoter that binds AP-1 , is important for Th2-restricted IL-4 expression .
Here we show that JunB , but not the other Jun family members , was selectively induced in Th2 cells and not in Thl cells during differentiation .
JunB has previously been considered to be a negative regulator of transcription .
However , we show that JunB binds directly to the P1 site and synergizes with c-Maf to activate an IL-4 luciferase reporter gene .
JunB-control of IL-4 expression is mediated by the phosphorylation of JunB at Thr102 and -104 by JNK MAP kinase .
The synergy between c-Maf and JunB can be attributed to cooperative DNA binding , which is facilitated by JunB phosphorylation .
In transgenic mice , elevated JunB levels caused increased expression of several Th2 cytokines in developing Th1 cells .
JunB also upregulated IL-4 expression in response to immunization .
Thus , the early increase of JunB protein in Th2 cells can provide the specificity for c-Maf in IL-4 expression during T cell development and directs thereby Th2 differentiation .
Keywords : cytokine/JunB/phosphorylation/Th2 Introduction In response to antigen stimulation , naive T helper ( Th ) cells differentiate into different types of effector cells that are classified based on their distinct cytokine profiles and immune regulatory functions ( Mosmann et al. , 1986 ; Paul and Seder , 1994 ) .
Th1 cells produce interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and interferon y ( IFN-y ) , and play an important role in the cell-mediated immune response against intracellular pathogens .
Th2 cells produce IL-4 , IL-5 and IL-10 , and are involved in humoral immunity and the allergic response .
There is ample evidence that the dominance of either Th1 or Th2 responses directly affects the outcome of a wide array of immunologically mediated clinical conditions , including autoimmune and allergic responses , and infectious diseases ( Abbas et al. , 1996 ; Romagnani , 1997 ) .
It is therefore of great clinical significance to 420 identify and manipulate factors that dictate the ratio of Th1 to Th2 cells .
The course of CD4 T cell differentiation appears to be influenced by many factors .
Cytokines are critical for the determination of the outcome of the differentiation to effector T cells ( Paul and Seder , 1994 ; Constant and Bottomly , 1997 ) .
Thus , IL-4 that is present during priming promotes the differentiation of Th2 cells while preventing the differentiation of Th1 cells ( Hsieh et al. , 1992 ; Seder et al. , 1992 ; Swain , 1993 ) , whereas IL-12 and IFN-y have the opposite effect ( Hsieh et al. , 1993 ; Manetti et al. , 1993 ; Seder et al. , 1993 ) .
The molecular basis for T helper cell subset differentiation is still unclear .
The well-established role of IL-4 in determining Th2 differentiation argues that regulating the expression of IL-4 during Th differentiation could determine the outcome .
Several regulatory sites have been identified within the 5 ' flanking region of the IL-4 gene which are capable of directing expression of a reporter gene in transient transfection studies ( Abe et al. , 1992 ; Li-Weber et al. , 1992 ; Bruhn et al. , 1993 ; Chuypilo et al. , 1993 ; Szabo et al. , 1993 ; Todd et al. , 1993 ; Rooney et al. , 1995 ) .
These sites , designated PO , P1 , P2 and P3 , contain sequences that bind members of the NFAT family of transcription factors .
P1 , P2 and P3 also contain adjacent sites that bind activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) ( Rooney et al. , 1995 ) .
Studies on cis-elements demonstrated that both the PO and P1 regions are important in determining Th2-specific expression of IL-4 .
A region encompassing PO was shown to confer preferential expression in long-term cultured Th2 cells but not in Th1 cells ( Bruhn et al. , 1993 ) .
This region contains an NFAT site and to its proximal side , a MARE half site which was shown to have binding affinity for both C/EBPRB and c-Maf ( Davydov et al. , 1995 ; Ho et al. , 1996 ) .
NFAT plays a pivotal role in IL-4 gene activation ( Chuvpilo et al. , 1993 ; Szabo et al. , 1993 ) .
However , it is present in both Thl and Th2 cells and activates the transcription of cytokine genes characteristic for both cell types ( Rooney et al. , 1994 , 1995 ) .
In contrast , c-Maf ( Ho et al. , 1996 ) and GATA-3 ( Zheng and Flavell , 1997 ) were recently reported to be selectively expressed in Th2 but not in Th1 cells and both are able to drive ectopic IL-4 expression .
c-Maf was shown to bind to a region proximal to PO and activate IL-4 transcription synergistically with NFATp ( Ho et al. , 1996 ) .
In transgenic mouse studies , a multimerized P1 region ( AP-1 plus NFAT ) conferred Th2-restricted expression of transcriptional activity during T cell differentiation ( Wenner et al. , 1997 ) .
In contrast , in a related study , multimerization of the NFAT binding site of the P1 element without the AP-1 site was expressed in both Th1 and Th2 subsets ( Aune and Flavell , 1997 ) .
These data suggested that Th2-specific regulation of the P1 element may result from regulation of transcription factors that bind to the AP-1 portion of the element .
© European Molecular Biology Organization Our recent examination of AP-1 activity during T helper cell differentiation using AP-1 luciferase transgenic mice showed that a high level of AP-1 transcriptional activity was induced upon stimulation in Th2 cells , but not in Th1 cells ( Rincon et al. , 1997 ) .
This AP-1 activity correlated with the presence of JunB , which accumulates in Th2 cells , but not in Th1 or naive T cells , suggesting a potential role for JunB in Th2 differentiation ( Rincon et al. , 1997 ) .
In the present study , we therefore examined whether JunB has any direct effect on IL-4 expression using both transient transfection and transgenic approaches .
Early transfection studies showed that JunB inhibits c-Jun transcriptional activity ( Chiu et al. , 1989 ; Schutte et al. , 1989 ) .
This observation and later findings that the N-terminal region of JunB possesses a docking site but not phosphorylation sites for JNK ( Gupta et al. , 1996 ; Kallunki et al. , 1996 ) both pointed to the hypothesis that JunB is a repressor of transcription mediated by AP-1 .
Here we show , however , that JunB is instead a strong transcriptional activator of IL-4 .
We demonstrate that JunB upregulates Th2 cytokines in transgenic mice and that JunB synergizes with c-Maf to activate the IL-4 promoter .
JunB transcriptional activity , as well as its synergism with c-Maf for IL-4 expression , is enhanced by phosphorylation on Thr1l02 and Thr1l04 by JNK .
These results provide a new molecular mechanism whereby precursor cells differentiate into effector cells secreting high levels of Th2 cytokines .
Results Preferential expression of JunB protein in Th2 cells Our previous study demonstrated that among the Jun family of transcription factors , AP-1 DNA-binding complexes containing JunB preferentially accumulated in Th2 cells but not in Thl cells ( Rincon et al. , 1997 ) .
We considered it to be likely that JunB accumulation would account for the enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity in Th2 cells .
To confirm the differential expression of JunB , we performed Western blot analysis using extracts from in vitro differentiated Th1 and Th2 cells ( Figure 1A ) .
At day 3 of in vitro differentiation of purified naive T cells , the JunB protein level was upregulated in Th2 cells relative to Th1 cells , while c-Jun and JunD protein levels were approximately the same in Thl and Th2 cells .
We further investigated the kinetics of JunB protein expression during the differentiation of Th precursors ( Figure 1B ) .
While the level of JunB protein remained relatively constant in developing Th1 cells , the JunB protein level was upregulated in developing Th2 cells at day 3 of in vitro priming .
Transactivation of the IL-4 promoter by JunB The upregulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity and accumulation of JunB in Th2 cells suggested that Th2-specific AP-1 activity is contributed by JunB .
The P1 site of the IL-4 promoter , previously shown to confer Th2-restricted IL-4 expression , is known to bind AP-1 .
These findings suggest a role for JunB in tissue-specific expression of IL-4 .
We therefore tested whether JunB could drive ectopic expression by the IL-4 promoter in the B lymphoma cell line M12 , which does not usually express IL-4 .

Upregulation of JunB in Th2 cells .
( A ) JunB is selectively upregulated in Th2 cells .
Naive T cells were differentiated into Th1 and Th2 for 3 days and nuclear extracts were isolated .
The amount of c-Jun , JunB and JunD was examined by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for each transcription factor .
( B ) Time course of JunB protein expression during Th1/Th2 differentiation .
Naive T cells were differentiated towards the Th1 or Th2 pathways and nuclear extracts were isolated from each population at various days as indicated .
JunB was detected by Western blot analysis .
A polyclonal antibody against actin was used as a loading control for immunoblots .
The full-length cDNA of JunB or other Jun family members were co-transfected with an IL-4 promoter ( -157 to +68 ) reporter plasmid into M12 cells .
The luciferase activity generated with or without PMA/ionomycin stimulation was measured .
A LacZ gene was also co-transfected and the B-galactosidase ( -gal ) activity was used as a control to normalize the luciferase reading for transfection efficiency .
Overall , c-Jun and JunB exhibited a similar ability , which was much greater than that of JunD , to activate ectopic expression of the IL-4 reporter gene ( Figure 2A ) .
Specifically , for both JunB and c-Jun , the activity of the IL-4 promoter responded in a dose-dependent manner in a range from 2-10 ug of input DNA yielding a 10-fold increase after PMA/ionomycin stimulation .
In contrast , no dramatic increase in IL-4 promoter activity was observed when as much as 10 ug JunD expression vector was co-transfected .
Since the transcriptional activity of c-Jun is known to be enhanced by phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAP kinases ) ( Whitmarsh and Davis , 1996 ) , we tested whether the high level of transcriptional activity that was induced in response to PMA/ionomycin was mediated by MAP kinase signaling pathways .
At least three distinct MAP kinase families have been identified : ERK ( extracellular signal-regulated kinase ) , JNK ( c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase , SAPK ) and p38 MAP kinase ( also known as cytokine-suppressive - anti-inflammatory - drug-binding protein , CSBP , or reactivating kinase , RK ) .
ERK is mainly involved in responses to signals initiated by growth factors and hormones ( Robinson and Cobb , 1997 ) , whereas JNK and p38 MAP kinase are activated by environmental stresses and pro-inflammatory cytokines ( Ip and Davis , 1998 ) .
In order to investigate the possible role of MAP kinases in IL-4 expression , we first examined MAP kinase activation in M12 cells after PMA/ionomycin treatment ( Figure 2B ) .

Transactivation of the IL-4 promoter by JunB .
( A ) Transactivation of the IL-4 promoter by c-Jun , JunB and JunD .
Various amounts of expression vector for Jun family members were co-transfected with 4 ug IL-4 promoter luciferase and 50 ng B-gal vectors into M12 cells .
The cells were left overnight and then treated ( black bars ) or not treated ( white bars ) with PMA/ionomycin .
Extracts were made 24 h later and relative activities of luciferase over LacZ were determined .
( B ) PMA/ionomycin stimulates JNK activity in M12 cells .
The cells were treated for various times , as indicated , with PMA/ionomycin .
Endogenous JNK , p38 MAP kinase and ERK were immunoprecipitated and the MAPK activity was measured in the immune complex by protein kinase assay using recombinant c-Jun , ATF2 and c-Myc as substrate , respectively .
The phosphorylated c-Jun , ATF2 and c-Myc were detected after SDS-PAGE by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis .
MAPK activity is presented as relative protein kinase activity .
( C ) JIP-1 blocks the induction of IL-4 luciferase expression in M12 cells .
M12 cells were co-transfected with c-Jun ( 5 ug ) or JunB ( 5 ug ) , IL-4 luciferase ( 4 ug ) and B-gal ( 50 ng ) vectors with or without JIP-1 ( 4 ug ) .
Cells were left overnight and then treated ( black bars ) or not treated ( white bars ) with PMA/ionomycin .
Relative activities of luciferase over LacZ were determined .
( D ) Transcriptional activation by JunB is promoter specific .
Four micrograms of IL-4 luciferase , c-Jun AP-1 luciferase or collagenase AP-1 luciferase construct and 50 ng B-gal vectors were co-transfected with 2 ug of expression vector for JunB , c-Jun or MLK3 , or various combinations as indicated into M12 cells .
No PMA/ionomycin was added .
Extracts were made 24 h later and relative activities of luciferase over LacZ were determined .
The endogenous JNK , p38 MAP kinase and ERK activity was measured by immune complex protein kinase assay using c-Jun , ATF2 and c-Myc as substrates , respectively .
Stimulation of M12 cells with PMA/ionomycin induced a potent and transient activation of JNK which reached a maximum after 30 min .
However , this treatment caused only a small increase in ERK activity and only modest changes in p38 MAP kinase activity were detected .
These data indicated a prominent role for JNK rather than p38 or ERK MAP kinases in the response of M12 cells to PMA/ionomycin .
422 We then studied the effect of the inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway on the induction of the IL-4 promoter activity .
The cytoplasmic JNK binding protein JIP-1 has recently been identified as a potent inhibitor of nuclear signal transduction by the JNK pathway when it is overexpressed ( Dickens et al. , 1997 ) .
Therefore , M12 cells were co-transfected with or without JIP-1 , JunB or c-Jun , and the IL-4 promoter reporter plasmid .
Figure 2C shows that JIP-1 inhibited both the c-Jun- and JunB-dependent activation of the IL-4 promoter in response to PMA/ ionomycin stimulation .
We further examined the role of the JNK signaling pathway in JunB-dependent IL-4 promoter activation .
Co-transfection of MLK3 , a potent inducer of signal transduction by the JNK pathway ( Rana et al. , 1996 ; Tibbles et al. , 1996 ) together with JunB or c-Jun dramatically enhanced IL-4 promoter activity ( Figure 2D ) .
Co-transfection of another JNK activator MKK7 ( Tournier et al. , 1997 ) together with JNK1 also enhanced JunB-and c-Jun-dependent IL-4 promoter activation ( data not shown ) .
These data demonstrated that JNK MAP kinase is involved in the regulation of JunB-dependent IL-4 promoter activity .
In one sense our results with JunB were puzzling since JunB has previously been shown to inhibit c-Jun-mediated transcription ( Chiu et al. , 1989 ; Schutte et al. , 1989 ) .
However , our experiments clearly established JunB as a transcriptional activator .
To examine whether JunB has similar activity in the context of other promoters , we used luciferase reporter constructs that contains either the c-Jun promoter AP-1 site or the collagenase promoter AP-1 site ( Figure 2D ) .
In all cases , c-Jun activated the promoters when co-transfected with MLK3 ; in contrast , JunB only showed activity at the IL-4 promoter .
Hence , transcriptional activation by JunB is promoter specific .
JunB is phosphorylated by the JNK MAP kinase c-Jun transcriptional activity is known to be regulated by phosphorylation on two serines ( residues 63 and 73 ) by the JNK MAP kinase ( Whitmarsh and Davis , 1996 ) .
In contrast , these phosphorylation sites are not conserved in JunB , although the JNK binding site is conserved in both c-Jun and JunB .
The presence of the JNK binding site in JunB suggests that JunB may be a substrate for JNK .
However , previous studies using fragments of JunB did not support this hypothesis ( Gupta et a/. , 1996 ; Kallunki et al. , 1996 ) .
We therefore examined potential sites of JunB phosphorylation by JNK using full-length recombinant JunB .
These studies demonstrated that JunB is indeed an excellent substrate for JNK ( Figure 3A ) .
In contrast , JunB was a weak substrate for the p38 MAP kinase and was not significantly phosphorylated by ERK MAP kinase .
Positive control experiments were performed by investigating the phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK , ATF2 by p38 MAP kinase , and c-Myc by ERK2 to ensure that all kinases were active .
Examination of the sequence of JunB revealed the motif Thr-Pro-Thr-Pro ( residues 102-105 ) which is in a primary sequence context that is similar to the sites of phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2 by JNK ( Gupta et al. , 1995 ) .
To examine whether Thr102 and Thr104 are sites of JunB phosphorylation by JNK , we examined the effect of replacement of these residues with Ala ( Figure 3B ) .
To determine the sites on JunB phosphorylated by JNK - MAP kinase , - phosphoamino-acid _ analysis was performed using wild-type and mutant glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -JunB .
The mutant JunBala protein was constructed by replacing Thr102 and Thr104 of JunB with Ala residues .
We immunopurified JNK from control ( - ) and UV-stimulated ( + ) cells , and recombinant wild-type or mutant JunB proteins were used as substrates in an immune complex protein kinase assay .

JunB is phosphorylated by JNK .
( A ) JunB is a better substrate for JNK than for p38 MAP kinase or ERK .
COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors ( pCDNA3 ) encoding either epitope-tagged-JNK1 , -p38a MAP kinase or -ERK2 .
Thirty-six hours after transfection , the cells were untreated ( - ) or treated ( + ) with UV-C ( 80 J/m '' ) or TPA ( 100 ng/ml ) .
The cells were harvested after incubation at 37°C ( 60 and 15 min , respectively ) .
Epitope-tagged MAP kinases were immunoprecipitated and the MAP kinase activity was measured in the immune complex by protein kinase assay using recombinant JunB , c-Jun , ATF2 or c-Myc as indicated .
The phosphorylated recombinant proteins were detected after SDS-PAGE by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis .
MAP kinase activity is presented as relative protein kinase activity .

Epitope-tagged-JNK1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation from extracts of cells stimulated ( + ) or not ( - ) with UV-C ( 80 J/m '' ) for 60 min and used for protein kinase assays with recombinant wild-type or mutant JunB , as substrates .
The mutant JunBala protein was constructed by replacing Thr102 and Thr104 with Ala residues .
The phosphorylated recombinant proteins were detected after SDS-PAGE by autoradiography and were analyzed by analysis .

JunB activates the IL-4 promoter synergistically with c-Maf .
( A ) JunB and c-Maf synergistically activate the IL-4 promoter .
Various combinations of expressions vectors as indicated were co-transfected with IL-4 luciferase and B-gal vectors into M12 cells .
The amount of DNAs used are IL-4 promoter luciferase 4 ug , B-gal 50 ng , c-Maf 0.8 ug , and all other DNAs 2 jig .
Luciferase and LacZ values were determined with or without stimulation .
( B ) Among Jun family members only JunB synergizes with c-Maf to activate the IL-4 promoter .
A JunB expression vector was co-transfected with expression vectors for different transcription factors , as indicated .
Luciferase assays were then performed .
The amount of DNA used was the same as above .
( C ) The synergy between JunB and c-Maf was enhanced by JunB phosphorylation .
JunB wild type ( JunB ) , JunB Thr102/104- > Ala mutant ( JunBala ) and JunB Thr102/104-Glu mutant ( JunBglu ) together with other DNAs were used in transient transfection assays .
The amount of JunB vectors used without c-Maf is indicated .
JunB vectors ( 2 pug ) were used in the transfection when both JunB and c-Maf were co-expressed .
( D ) Phosphorylation does not change JunB protein expression in the transfection experiment .
Figure 4C was repeated with Flag-tagged JunB , JunBala and JunBglu constructs .
The amount of JunB protein in the last six samples of Figure 4C was determined by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against the Flag epitope .
type JunB .
In contrast , when JunBala was used as a substrate for JNK , only a small increase in the level of was observed .
Control studies were performed using wild-type c-Jun and mutated c-Jun in which the JNK phosphorylation sites Ser63 and Ser73 were replaced with Ala residues ( c-Junala ) .
As expected , the marked serine phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK was abrogated in the c-Junala mutant ( data not shown ) .
These data demonstrated that JunB is phosphorylated by JNK MAP kinase on Thr102 and Thr1Q04 .
To further confirm the involvement of JunB phosphorylation in the transfection assays described in this report , we examined whether JunB is phosphorylated in M12 cells .
A Flag-tagged JunB expression vector was co-transfected with JNK1 expression vector with or without 424 a MLK3 expression vector into M12 cells .
Cell extracts were isolated 24 h later and Western blot analysis was performed using a monoclonal antibody against Flag .
Co-transfection of MLK3 induced phosphorylation of JunB , which was manifested as a slower-migrating band .
In contrast , the phosphorylated , slower-migrating band was not observed in co-transfection assay using MLK3 and JunBala .
Thus , in M12 cells , JunB is phosphorylated on Thr102 and Thr104 residues .
JunB and c-Maf activate the IL-4 promoter synergistically Next we co-transfected with JunB other transcription factors that are known to activate the IL-4 promoter , including NFATp , NFATce , GATA-3 , C/EBPB and c-Maf .

While c-Maf alone or JunB alone stimulated the IL-4 promoter activity by ~6- and ~4-fold , respectively , c-Maf and JunB together generated an ~50-fold stimulation .
Remarkably , the synergy between c-Maf and JunB was specific , as this effect was not observed when JunB was substituted with the other Jun family members c-Jun and JunD ( Figure 4B ) .
To determine whether the state of phosphorylation of JunB has any effect on the synergy between JunB and c-Maf , we co-transfected c-Maf with JunBala or JunBglu Fig .

JunB binds the IL-4 promoter synergistically with c-Maf .
( A ) Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis ( EMSA ) of the P1 element .
Radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the AP-1 and NFAT site of the P1 element was used in the gel shift assay .
Extracts are made from activated Th2 cells ( see Materials and methods ) .
C-Jun and JunB antibodies were used for supershift analysis .
( B ) Interaction between JunB and c-Maf .
The C-terminal ( b-Zip domain ) and N-terminal halves of c-Maf with S-tag were immobilized on agarose .
In vifro translated c-Jun , JunB and JunD labeled with [ *°S } methionine were incubated with the beads .
Bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE .
C-Maf and N-Maf refer to proteins bound to beads coupled with C- and N-terminal halves of c-Maf .

Sequences of the DNA fragment spanning -87 to -31 of the IL-4 promoter and various mutants .

( D ) C-Maf binding to IL-4 promoter DNA is facilitated by phosphorylated JunB .
Wild-type or mutant DNA fragments were incubated with c-Maf beads and with or without various protein preparations as indicated .
Bound DNA fragments were resolved on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel .
( E ) The AP-1 and MARE sites are required for synergistic activation of IL-4 promoter by JunB and c-Maf .
IL-4 promoter luciferase constructs with either the AP-1 site or the MARE site mutated were compared with the wild-type IL-4 promoter construct with a luciferase assay .
mutants .
JunBglu was constructed by replacing Thr102 and Thr104 with glutamic acid residues .
JunBglu would therefore be expected to mimic a constitutively active form of JunB .
Both mutants and the wild-type JunB vector when co-transfected alone with the IL-4 reporter gene generated modest activation of the IL-4 promoter ( Figure 4C ) .
Although there was still some synergy with c-Maf when JunBala was co-transfected , the activity was lower than when wild-type JunB was used .
However , the JunBglu mutant generated a very potent synergy with c-Maf in activating the IL-4 promoter .
These data indicated that phosphorylation of JunB enhanced its ability to 425 B.Li et al .
synergize with c-Maf in transcriptional activation .
Since the protein stability of c-Jun is known to be influenced by phosphorylation ( Ip and Davis , 1998 ) , we examined the JunB protein level in the above transfection experiments by Western blot analysis .
Similar amounts of JunB and JunB-mutant proteins were detected in each sample regardless of the status of PMA/ionomycin treatment or c-Maf co-transfection ( Figure 4D ) .
Thus , the different levels of luciferase activity measured using the different JunB proteins was not caused by changes in the amount of JunB protein .
Cooperative binding of JunB and c-Maf to IL-4 promoter DNA Previous gel-shift experiments using the Th2 cell-specific P1 element showed that JunB is able to bind to the AP-1 site ( Rooney et al. , 1995 ) .
Extracts from Th2 cells cultured from primary T cells form a similar pattern of shifted bands on the P1 element ( Wenner et al. , 1997 ) , and competition experiments using various oligonucleotides showed that the AP-1 site was bound .
To examine whether JunB is the AP-1 factor that binds to P1 in primary T cells , we performed gel-shift experiments using P1 oligonucleotides and nuclear extracts from day 3 Th2 cells differentiated in vitro .
The double-shifted bands characteristic of the P1 element were formed , and the upper band was supershifted by JunB antibody but not by c-Jun antibody ( Figure 5A ) .
The synergy between JunB and c-Maf raised the possibility that JunB interacts directly with c-Maf , since c-Jun was known to bind c-Maf directly ( Kerppola and Curran , 1994 ) .
Alternatively , indirect interaction through a common binding partner , a transcriptional co-activator for example , was also possible We expressed both the C-terminal half b-Zip domain and the N-terminal half of the recombinant c-Maf protein in Escherichia coli , and immobilized the purified proteins on agarose beads taking advantage of the S-tag in the expression vector construct .
We incubated the beads with radiolabeled JunB , c-Jun or JunD protein obtained from in vitro transcription-translation reactions .
Both JunB and c-Jun bound to the C-terminal half of c-Maf which contains the leucine-zipper motif ( Figure 5B ) .
In contrast , JunD did not bind to either moiety of c-Maf .
c-Maf has been reported to bind the MARE half site around -40 bp of the IL-4 promoter ( Ho et al. , 1996 ) .
We therefore sought to determine whether JunB also bound this site , potentially in cooperation with c-Maf .
However , an EMSA experiment using a probe of -62 to -25 bp of the IL-4 promoter did not form any bands that could be supershifted by JunB antibody ( data not shown ) .
To examine whether JunB potentiated the binding of c-Maf to DNA , we took beads carrying immobilized c-Maf and added in vitro translated JunB and radiolabeled DNA fragments spanning bps -87 to -31 of the IL-4 promoter and various mutants of this DNA element ( sequences listed in Figure 5C ) .
We did not observe any substantial increase in bound DNA when in vitro-translated JunB was used ( data not shown ) .
However , we did see a large increase in DNA bound to c-Maf when we substituted the in vitro-translated JunB with extracts from M12 cells transfected with JunB and treated with PMA/ionomycin ( Figure 5D ) .

Upregulation of Th2 cytokines in JunB transgenic mice .
( A ) RT-PCR .
Naive T cells were isolated from transgenic or wild-type littermates and differentiated in vitro toward Th1 using ConA , IL-12 and anti-IL-4 antibody .
Three days later , total RNA was isolated and cytokine RT-PCR was done .

( F ) [ °H ] thymidine was added to the culture at day 3 and incorporation of radioactivity was measured 18 h later in triplicate .
facilitate DNA binding even with PMA/ionomycin treat-ment , while extracts from JunBglu transfected cells were sufficient to mediate binding even without PMA/ionomycin treatment .
These experiments argue strongly that the cooperative DNA binding of JunB and c-Maf is facilitated by JunB phosphorylation .
To map the DNA sequence that is required for this cooperative binding , we used the -87/-31 bp fragment of the IL-4 promoter with mutations at various sites .
Mutations at the P1 AP-1 site and the MARE half site greatly reduced DNA binding while mutations at either NFAT sites had no effect ( Figure 5D ) .
These experiments indicated that JunB and c-Maf bind distant elements ( centered on -80 and -40 , respectively ) of the IL-4 promoter and that cooperativity of binding is facilitated through JunB phosphorylation .
To test further whether the AP-1 and MARE sites are required for JunB and c-Maf mediated synergistic activation of IL-4 promoter , we generated IL-4 promoter luciferase constructs with either the AP-1 site or the MARE site mutated .
Figure 5E shows that both constructs lost the ability to support synergistic promoter activation by JunB and c-Maf in luciferase assays .
Thus , synergy between JunB and c-Maf requires functional AP-1 and MARE sites .
Upregulation of cytokines in differentiating Th1 cells from JunB transgenic mice To examine whether JunB plays a causal role in Th2 cytokine expression in vivo , we generated transgenic mice that express JunB in T cells ( Figure 6A ) .
Since the CD4 promoter construct we employed lacks the CD4 silencer , JunB is expressed in both CD4 and CD8 cells ( Killeen et al. , 1993 ) .
The expression of the JunB transgene in peripheral T cells was verified by RT-PCR using one primer derived from the first exon of CD4 gene and the other primer from the 5 ' region of JunB cDNA ( Figure 6A ) .
Of the nine transgenic lines generated , four lines tested positive for transgene expression .
Among them , line 62 has a higher copy number and higher expression level than other lines ( Figure 6B ) .
We then examined JunB protein levels in T cells by Western blot analysis ( Figure 6C ) .
JunB protein was significantly increased in transgenic mice compared with wild-type littermates .
It should be noted that this increase is roughly equivalent to the 427 B.Li et al .
increase of the endogenous JunB protein in Th2 cells ( Figure 1 ) .
Expression of the JunB transgene did not have any overt effect on lymphocyte development since the transgenic lines had normal profiles of thymocyte subpopu-lations staining for CD4 and CDS and spleen cells ( CD4 and CD8 cells , and B cells ) ( data not shown ) .
The proliferation of naive CD4 T cells in response to Con A , IL-2 and APC was slightly enhanced in the transgenic lines compared with the wild-type littermates ( Figure 6D ) .
To test whether JunB is sufficient to turn on Th2 cytokine expression , we examined the effect of the JunB transgene in Th1 cells , a condition where Th2 cytokine expression is not usually observed .
We reasoned that elevation of the JunB level in Th1 cells by transgenesis to an equivalent level as found in Th2 cells would test whether JunB plays a similar role in Th2 differentiation .
Naive CD4 T cells from transgene-positive animals and negative littermates were differentiated in vitro to the Th1 subset by culture with ConA plus IL-2 , IL-12 and anti-IL-4 mAb for 3 days , by which time T helper cells have already differentiated to produce the corresponding cytokines .
The expression levels of several cytokines were examined by RT-PCR ( Figure 7A ) .
In both transgenic lines examined , the level of IFN-y was essentially the same as that in the wild-type littermate controls .
In contrast , a much higher level of IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA was observed in both transgenic lines than in the negative littermate controls .
The levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were also increased .
The slightly stronger signal seen in line 62 corresponded with its higher level of JunB expression than in other lines .
To quantitate the amount of cytokines produced in the culture , we performed ELISA with the supernatant of the day 3 culture used above ( Figure 7B ) .
In the transgenic T cells , IFN-y remained unchanged at high level .
The amount of IL-5 was increased by 3- to 4-fold ; the amount of IL-6 and IL-10 were both increased , although to a lesser extent .
IL-4 secretion by both wild-type and transgenic cells was virtually undetectable due to the fact that anti-IL-4 mAb was added to the culture to skew the response toward Th1 differentiation ( data not shown ) .
To quantitate the difference in IL-4 secretion , we repeated the above experiment without anti-IL-4 mAb .
ELISA measurements showed that T cells from JunB transgenic mice produced 4- to 5-fold more IL-4 than negative littermates ( Figure 7C ) .
These data indicated that overexpression of JunB was sufficient to turn on Th2 cytokine expression , even in a Th1l population .
Upregulation of IL-4 in antigen re-stimulated T cells from KLH-immunized mice To test whether JunB transgenic T cells were predisposed to develop into IL-4 producing cells in vivo , we immunized mice using Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin ( KLH ) with complete Freund 's Adjuvant ( CFA ) and harvested T cells from draining lymph nodes after 9 days .
Cytokine production by these cells in response to KLH was measured by ELISA ( Figure 7D and E ) .
KLH in CFA elicits an immune reaction skewed toward Thl .
As expected , we saw a relatively high level of IFN-y production using wild-type T cells .
The amount of IFN-y produced in transgenic T cells , however , was slightly lower ( Figure 7D ) .
Interestingly , although the amount of IL-4 produced in both wild 428 type and transgenic cells was quite low , there was a consistently higher amount of IL-4 produced by the transgenic T cells ( Figure 7E ) .
At the same time , the proliferative ability of the transgenic T cells was essentially the same as the negative littermate T cells ( Figure 7F ) .
Thus , elevation of JunB levels to that of Th2 cells is sufficient to direct the synthesis of Th2 cytokines in Th1 cell populations .
Discussion The molecular basis for T-helper-restricted expression of cytokines is poorly understood .
IL-4 is the key cytokine that determines the Th2-differentiation pathway .
Recently , c-Maf ( Ho et al. , 1996 ) and GATA-3 ( Zheng and Flavell , 1997 ) have been shown to be selectively expressed in Th2 but not in Th1 cells .
Both factors are able to induce IL-4 gene expression in populations that normally do not express this gene .
In addition , GATA-3 has a profound global effect on the expression of most Th2 cytokines .
While it is at present unclear how GATA-3 acts , either locally at cytokine promoters or globally at the Th2 locus or both , c-Maf directly binds and activates the IL-4 gene .
However , it is not yet clear how c-Maf plays its role in Th2 differentiation since by the time c-Maf upregulation is manifested at day 8 after T cell activation ( Ho et al. , 1996 ) , Th2 differentiation has been completed for several days .
Our studies ( Rincon et al. , 1997 ; this report ) show that a third transcription factor , JunB , is selectively expressed in developing Th2 cells but not in Thl cells .
Moreover , we now demonstrate that JunB plays a causal role in this process since JunB overexpression in transgenic mice upregulated all Th2 cytokines assayed .
We further demonstrate that JunB and c-Maf activate IL-4 expression synergistically .
The early upregulation of JunB in Th2 cells could provide the tissue specificity for c-Maf during Th2 differentiation while the accumulation of large amounts of c-Maf later might serve to maintain a high level of IL-4 .
Previous studies of the role of AP-1 in T helper cell development have generated somewhat inconsistent results .
First , different observations were made as to whether AP-1 complexes are differentially accumulated in Thl versus Th2 cells .
In gel-shift experiments using extracts from long-term Thl and Th2 clones AE7 and D1QO , Rooney et al .
( 1995 ) found that AP-1 complexes from both AE7 and D10 cells were able to bind the P1 element of the IL-4 promoter , and that JunB was present in both of the complexes that were detected by EMSA .
However , in another study using primary T cells ( Wenner et al. , 1997 ) , the AP-1-containing complex which shows a lower mobility in the gel-shift assay was only observed using activated Th2 extracts .
A parallel study ( Rincon and Flavell , 1997 ) also found accumulated AP-1 complexes with some c-Fos , and high levels of JunB-containing complexes in Th2 cells but not in Th1 cells .
Furthermore , AP-1 transcriptional activity was also enhanced in Th2 cells relative to Th1 cells .
Secondly , different conclusions have been made as to whether AP-1 contributes to Th2-specific IL-4 expression .
The observation that the NFAT/ AP-1 sites of the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters were functionally interchangeable in AE7 and D10 cells ( Rooney et al. , 1995 ) led to the proposal that AP-1 does not determine Th1/Th2 specificity .
However , in transgenic mice , multimerization of the same NFAT/AP-1 site was found to direct luciferase reporter gene expression only in Th2 cells ( Wenner et al. , 1997 ) as was the expression of similar AP-1 and NFAT/AP-1 sites from the IL-2 promoter ( Rincon and Flavell , 1997 ; Rincon et al. , 1997 ) .
These discrepancies could simply represent the different behaviors of long-term T cell clones and primary cells , or alternatively , differences in experimental systems .
The analysis of promoter activity during the process of Th1/ Th2 differentiation not only provides a normal cellular context , but also addresses developmental requirements and we have therefore used this approach ( Rincon and Flavell , 1997 ; Rincon et al. , 1997 ; this study ) .
Our finding that JunB is specifically induced in developing Th2 cells provides a molecular explanation for the observation that P1 NFAT/AP-1 elements drive Th2-restricted expression .
Several mechanisms assure the specificity of IL-4 gene activation by JunB .
First , the differential induction of JunB was not observed for either c-Jun or JunD .
Thus , JunB is the only Jun family member that is differentially regulated and has the potential to contribute to Th-specific gene expression .
Secondly , among the Jun family members , only JunB is capable of synergizing with c-Maf to activate the IL-4 gene .
As shown by Western blot analysis , c-Jun is present in both Th1l and Th2 cells , and c-Jun alone possesses an ability to activate the IL-4 promoter that is similar to JunB .
However , the synergy between JunB and c-Maf generates much higher IL-4 promoter activity , while c-Jun can only generate at most low level activity in this context .
Finally , the fact that JunB was found to inhibit c-Jun transcriptional activity could provide another mechanism for this specificity ( Chiu et al. , 1989 ; Schutte et al. , 1989 ) .
Although it was proposed that JunB might form heterodimers with c-Jun and thus attenuate the formation of c-Jun homodimers , the mechanism for JunB inhibition of c-Jun transcriptional activity is not clear .
Our discovery that JunB is an excellent substrate for JNK raised the possibility that in those experiments overexpressed JunB might have competed with c-Jun for JNK binding and thus led to reduced c-Jun phosphorylation .
The fact that JunB has a much lower activity than c-Jun in driving transcription of a TRE-luciferase reporter and its apparent inhibitory effect on c-Jun transcriptional activity ( Chiu et al. , 1989 ; Schutte et al. , 1989 ) has loosely classified JunB as a transcriptional repressor .
However , our study has clearly shown that JunB directly binds the IL-4 promoter and activates its transcription .
Interestingly , JunB does not activate two other constructs containing AP-1 binding sites , while c-Jun does .
Thus , JunB differs in its promoter selectivity from c-Jun and activates or inhibits transcription within a specific promoter context .
A striking finding of our current study is the role of phosphorylation on JunB function in T helper cells .
Previously JunB had not been thought to be a phosphorylation substrate for JNK , despite the fact that this molecule has a conserved JNK binding site ( Gupta et al. , 1996 ; Kallunki et a/. , 1996 ) .
We found , however , that the synergy of JunB with c-Maf was strongly potentiated by stimulation of M12 cells with PMA plus ionomycin .
Furthermore , direct studies of JunB phosphorylation showed that two threonine residues flanked by prolines ( Thr1l02 and JunB regulates Th2 differentiation Thr104 ) were phosphorylated equally efficiently as the prototypic JNK phosphorylation sites at Ser63 and Ser73 of c-Jun ( Figure 3A ) .
The JunB phosphorylation sites are similar to the phosphorylation sites on ATF-2 , also recognized by JNK ( Gupta et al. , 1995 ) .
Consistent with these findings , removal of these phosphorylation sites by replacement of both Thr residues with Ala , abolished phosphorylation and reduced the transcriptional synergy with c-Maf .
Conversely , replacement of these Thr residues with Glu , mimicking constitutive phosphorylation at these sites , gave stronger synergy in the absence of stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin than was observed with wild-type or Ala mutants ( Figure 4C ) .
The initial observation of transcriptional synergy between JunB and c-Maf and the fact that they are both b-Zip proteins raised the possibility that they might form heterodimers ( Kerppola and Curran , 1994 ) .
Although we found that JunB directly interacts with c-Maf in vitro , we could not identify a DNA element that binds JunB within the vicinity of the c-Maf binding site .
The identification of the P1 element as the binding site for JunB indicated that JunB and c-Maf probably bind to independent sites , possibly as homodimers .
The DNA-binding experiment using c-Maf beads suggests that JunB and c-Maf interact with each other , directly or indirectly ( Figure 5 ) .
This interaction is enhanced by JunB phosphorylation , which also contributed significantly to the transcriptional synergy between JunB and c-Maf suggesting that this interaction mediates this synergy .
The potentiation of c-Maf DNA binding by JunB appears to be mediated , at least in part , by the phosphorylation of JunB by JNK at Thr102 and Thr1Q04 .
This may explain why c-Jun only poorly mediates this interaction and therefore does not synergize with c-Maf to drive transcription mediated by the IL-4 promoter .
In contrast , c-Jun is strongly phosphorylated at Ser63 and Ser73 , and is only poorly phosphorylated by JNK on other sites .
Similar to our previous findings with GATA-3 , JunB stimulates expression of multiple Th2 cytokine genes .
JunB strongly actives IL-4 and IL-5 , and modestly activates IL-6 and IL-10 expression ( Figure 7 ) whereas GATA-3 strongly increased IL-4 , IL-6 and IL-10 , and to a lesser extent IL-5 .
JunB could induce IL-4 expression directly and increase the expression of other cytokines indirectly through the effect on IL-4 .
However , the fact that little IL-4 was present in the Th1 culture due to the addition of IL-4 antibody argues against the latter scenario .
Alternatively , JunB could directly activate each cytokine gene .
JunB emerges as a new Th2-specific transcription factor that regulates Th2-restricted cytokine expression .
It would be interesting to further dissect in future experiments the immediate early events that lead to upregulation of JunB in Th2 cells but not in Thl cells , which ultimately influences the fate of Th1/Th2 differentiation .

Protein kinase assays Epitope-tagged MAPKs were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts by incubation for 3 h at 4°C with the M2 monoclonal antibody to Flag ( IBI-Kodak ) or 12CA5 monoclonal antibody to HA ( Boehringer Mannheim ) bound to protein G-Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia-LKB Biotechnology , Inc. ) .
Endogenous JNK , p38 MAPK and ERK were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies pre-bound to protein A-Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia-LKB Biotechnology , Inc. ) .
The immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and three times with the kinase buffer ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4 , 25 mM B-glycerophosphate , 25 mM MgCl ; , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate ) .
The MAPK activity was measured at 30°C for 20 min in 30 pil of kinase buffer containing 1 ug of recombinant GST-Jun , GST-JunB , GST-ATF2 or GST-Mye and 50 uM [ y°P ] JATP ( 10 Ci/mmol , 1 Ci = 37.6 Gbg ) .
The reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer .
Proteins were resolved by 10 % SDS-PAGE and identified by autoradiography .
The incorporation of [ °°PJphosphate into the GST fusion protein was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis .
Phosphoamino acid analysis Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by partial acid hydrolysis ( 1 h at 110°C in 6 M HCJ ) and thin layer electrophoresis as described ( Davis and Czech , 1985 ) .
Protein immobilization and DNA binding The expression vectors pET29 containing N-terminal ( amino acid residues 1-170 ) and C-terminal ( amino acid residues 171-370 ) fragments of c-Maf were kind gifts from Dr L.Glimcher .
The truncated c-Maf proteins were expressed using T7 polymerase in the BL21 ( DE3 ) strain .
The proteins were induced as described ( Ho et al. , 1996 ) and purified using the S-tag purification kit ( Novagen ) .
Proteins were immobilized on the beads without the final elution step .
In vitro transcription-translation was done using the Promega TNT coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system with incorporated .
Proteins from a 12.5 ul reaction were used as input to assay for c-Maf binding .
The reaction also contains 20 ul c-Maf beads in a total volume of 50 pl .
The binding buffer was the same as the EMSA binding buffer .
The samples were mixed on a rotator at room temperature for 2 h and washed with binding buffer three times .
Proteins immobilized on the beads were separated on a 10 % SDS-PAGE gel and exposed to film .
The transcription-translation vectors JunDpKS* , JunBpKS* and c-JunpTZ18R were kind gifts of Dr R.Bravo .
For the c-Maf-beads DNA binding experiments either 12.5 ul TNT product or 100 ug extract from M12 cells ( 2 % 10° M12 cells transfected with 20 ug JunB , JunBala , JunBglu or c-Jun expression vector ; PMA/ionomycin was added 1h before making extracts ) , 40 pull c-Maf Beads , 30 ug poly ( dI-dC ) with or without radiolabeled DNA fragment ( 1 X10° c.p.m . )
in 100 ul total volume were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with constant mixing .
After binding , beads were washed three times and extracted with phenol .
DNA was ethanol precipitated and resolved on an 8 % polyacrylamide gel .
Luciferase assay For luciferase assays , 4 ug IL-4 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.8 ug c-Maf expression plasmids were used .
For all other expression plasmids , 2 ug of was used unless otherwise noted in the figure legends .
Protein concentration of the M12 extracts were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent .
Two-hundered micrograms of extract was used to assay luciferase activity with the Promega luciferase assay substrate .
Fifty nanograms of a LacZ reporter plasmid was co-transfected in all the experiments .
Fifty micrograms of extract was incubated with 8 mM chlorophenolred-B-p-galactopyranoside ( CPRG ) , 0.2 M Na , HPOy4 pH 7.3 , 1 mM MgCl , , and 45 mM B-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at 37°C and ODs ; , readings were measured .
