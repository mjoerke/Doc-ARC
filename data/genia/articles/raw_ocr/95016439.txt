The IL-2 octamer motif is a composite cis-element which binds Oct-1 and Oct-2 as well as a TPA/Ca*+-inducible nuclear factor , previously termed octamer-associated protein ( OAP® ) .
We show here that Oct-2 , despite the presence of an active transcriptional activation domain , requires TPA/Ca**-induced signals to strongly transactivate the IL-2 octamer motif in Jurkat T cells .
This Oct-2-dependent transactivation is inhibited by RA .
The presence of an intact COOH-terminal domain of Oct-2 contributes to both TPA/Ca'*-induced transactivation and the RA-mediated repression .
We also show that both Fos and Jun components of the AP-1 factors participate in the OAP complex .
Furthermore , transfected c-jun , jun-B , jun-D , c-fos , or Fos-B expression vectors partially substitute for TPA and Ca '' +* and cooperate with Oct-2 for the transactivation of the combined OAP/octamer cis-element .
Mutations of the genuine octamer-binding site abrogate both the binding of Oct-1 and Oct-2 and the TPA/Ca** -induced transactivation of the OAP/octamer motif , OAP confers to Oct-2 responsivity to both TPA/Ca®* and RA , since specific mutations of the AP-1/OAP-binding site significantly reduce the transactivation by Oct-2 in response to TPA and Ca** and abolish the inhibition by RA .
Furthermore , retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) & is able to inhibit in vitro the formation of the complex between the nuclear AP-1/OAP and its specific binding site , resulting in the interference with Oct-2-dependent cis-regulatory function of this AP-1 element .
Therefore , we propose that the TPA/calcium-activated AP-1/OAP element is the main target of positive or negative regulatory signals influencing the IL-2 octamer motif , through synergism with Oct-2 and antagonism by RAR .
etinoic acid ( RA ) !
exerts a wide variety of effects on embryonic development , cell differentiation , and growth through regulation of growth factors and homeotic genes and protooncogenes ( 1-7 ) .
Retinoids bind to several receptors 1 Abbreviations used in this paper : CAT , chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; GR , glucocorticoid receptor ; NFAT , nuclear factor of activated T cells ; PKC , protein kinase C ; RA , retinoic acid ; RAR , retinoic acid receptor ; RARE-3 , RAR-responsive element of the RAR ( 3 promoter ; RRL , rabbit reticulocyte lysate ; RXR , retinoid X receptor ; tk , thymidine kinase ; TPA , 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate .
( e.g. , retinoic acid receptors [ RAR ] x , B , and y and retinoid X receptor [ RXR ] ax , 3 , and y and their isoforms ) , which combine with each other to form a variety of dimers able to bind and transactivate specific cis-elements of target genes ( for review see reference 8 ) .
The range of genes controlled by retinoids is further broadened by the ability of RAR and RXR to control the expression of genes encoding other transacting factors , such as the homeotic Hox genes , nuclear pro-tooncogenes , and the development-related octamer-binding proteins ( 1 , 4 , 6 , 9-12 ) .
This latter class of proteins belongs to the POU family of transacting factors characterized by a homeodomain DNA-binding region ( 13 , 14 ) .

The influence of RAR on lymphoid T cell differentiation and growth is suggested by the ability of RA to modulate the expression of the human and murine IL-2 genes , which encode a major T lymphocyte growth factor ( 23 , 24 ) involved in the control of T cell development ( 25 , 26 ) .
The use of retinoids as therapeutic agents and the subsequent potential immunosuppression and influence on development underline the importance of elucidating their regulatory role in the IL-2 gene .
The IL-2 promoter contains several control elements , which mainly require a variety of transacting factors activated by protein kinase C ( PKC ) and calcium-mediated signals ( for reviews see references 27 and 28 ) .
We have previously reported that one target of the RAR-mediated inhibition of the PKC-and calcium-mediated activation of the IL-2 enhancer is an octamer motif at a position -96 to -66 bp upstream of the start site ( 23 ) .
This motif binds the inducible nuclear factor ( s ) OAP® , whose composition includes jun protein ( 29 , 30 ) , as well as both Oct-1- and Oct-2-transacting factors ( 29 , 31 , 32 ) , which are , therefore , potential targets of RA-mediated regulation .
Whereas Oct-1 is ubiquitous , Oct-2 has a more restricted pattern of cell distribution , being expressed in B cells and in some T cells ( 31 , 32 ) .
Furthermore , both transacting factors are regulated by stimuli that activate the IL-2 gene ( 29 , 31 , 32 ) .
Specifically , Oct-2 levels are upregulated by antigen stimulation in some T cells ( 32 ) .
The presence of distinct Oct factors regulating cytokine gene expression suggests that they might be responsive to differential regulatory pathways .
Indeed , distinct transcriptional requirements for Oct-1 and Oct-2 have been reported .
Whereas Oct-1 is competent in enhancing transcription from snRNA promoters , it requires supplementation by auxiliary factors , which provide transcriptional activation domains ( e.g. , the herpes virus VP16 protein harbors a strong acidic transactivation domain ) to activate mRNA promoters ( 13 , 33 ) .
In contrast , Oct-2 harbors a strong COOH-terminal transcriptional activation domain for mRNA promoters , which when replacing the Oct-1 COOH terminus , can provide transcriptional activation ( 13 , 34 ) .
The OAP® complex may represent auxiliary factors required for Oct-1 function .
However , the requirements of Oct-2 for the regulation of the IL-2 promoter remain to be elucidated .
In this study we have addressed the molecular events implicated in the Oct-2-dependent activation and RA-induced downregulation of the octamer motif of the IL-2 enhancer .
We show that the IL-2 octamer motif is a composite binding site for Oct-2 and a fos- and jun-containing AP-1 complex , whose functional cooperation is required to fully enhance transcription .
RARa « is able to inhibit the formation of the AP-1-DNA complex in vitro , resulting in an interference with the Oct-2-dependent cis-regulatory function of this AP-1 element .
Therefore , the AP-1 element appears to be the main target for positive or negative regulatory signals that influence 1486 the IL-2 octamer motif , either through cooperation with Oct-2 or antagonism by RAR .

Results TPA and Calcium Ionophore-mediated Induction of Oct-2-dependent Activation of the IL-2 Octamer Motif and Its Antagonism by RA .
Activation of intact ( -300 bp ) IL-2 enhancer and the -96 to -66-bp IL-2 octamer motif fused to a heterologous tk promoter was demonstrated in Jurkat cells transfected with Oct-2 expression vector after treatment with TPA and ionomycin ( Fig .
1 ) .
Transactivation of the IL-2 enhancer and IL-2 octamer motif driving either the -105-bp tk or the -37-bp tk promoters was significantly stronger in Jurkat cells transfected with Oct-2 expression vector after TPA and ionomycin treatment than that caused by endogenous Oct-1 in cells transfected with empty pCG vector ( Fig .
1 A ) .
Accumulation of nuclear Oct-2-IL-2 octamer complex could be demonstrated in cells devoid of endogenous Oct-2 transfected with pCG-Oct2 vector , which encodes Oct-2 under the control of the CMV promoter ( Fig .
1 B ) .
The levels of this complex were augmented 10-20-fold by TPA and ionomycin treatment due to upregulation of the CMV promoter ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
This drug-induced augmentation in Oct-2 levels alone would not appear to contribute to IL-2 octamer motif transactivation as CAT activity in the absence of TPA and ionomycin treatment was not significantly increased , despite similar levels of intracellular Oct-2 protein ( Fig .
1 , B and C ; compare CAT activity and intracellular Oct-2 levels in cells transfected with 0.2 ug pCG-Oct-2 and treated with TPA /ionomycin to those transfected with 5 ug pCG-Oct-2 in the absence of TPA/ ionomycin ) .
Similar results were obtained when Oct-2 expression vector driven by the RSV promoter ( RSV-Oct2 ) was transfected into Jurkat cells , which was not significantly influenced by TPA/ionomycin ( 51 ; Fig .
1 A ) .
This would suggest a requirement for additional TPA /ionomycin-induced coregulatory signals in Oct-2-mediated transactivation of octamer motif .
TPA/ionomycin-induced Oct-2-dependent transactivation of both the intact IL-2 and the -96 to -66-bp IL-2 octamer motif was significantly inhibited by RA ( Fig .
1 A ) .
As RA neither inhibited the activity of the CMV promoter , used to drive Oct-2 transcription ( Fig .
14 ) , nor decreased the levels of Oct-2 protein resulting from transfection ( Fig .
1 D ) , the inhibitory activity of RA likely resulted from interference with TPA /ionomycin-induced coregulatory signals .
These data suggest that the -96 to -66-bp IL-2 octamer motif is the focal point for both RA-mediated inactivation and the TPA /ionomycin-mediated cofactor requirement of Oct-2-dependent IL-2 transactivation .

40 e - , Oct-2 vector ( jig ) in the inhibitory activity of RA , we cotransfected several constructs encoding Oct-2 and Oct-1 proteins carrying deletions in the or COOH-terminal regions or chimeric proteins together with the IL-2-0AP/OCT- ( -105 ) tk-CAT reporter ( Fig .
2 ) .
The levels of expression and integrity of these transfected wild-type mutant Oct-2 and Oct-2 proteins in each transfection were monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) of nuclear extracts from an aliquot of transfected cells .
The complexes observed in EMSA were , in each case , consistent with expression of the full-length protein ( Fig .
2 B ) .
The analysis of the transfected Oct-2 and Oct-1 proteins by EMSA showed that all mutant or chimeric proteins accumulated within the cells to comparable levels under 1488 basal conditions and after TPA /ionomycin or RA treatments ( Fig .
2 B ) .
Oct protein levels analyzed by Western immunoblotting ( with anti-Oct-2 and anti-Oct-1 antibodies ; 46 ) corresponded to those determined by EMSA ( data not shown ) .
Similar TPA /ionomycin-induced transcriptional activation function and repression by RA was observed with Oct-2 proteins deleted of the proximal ( 94 amino acids , Oct-2AN1 ) or distal ( adjacent glutamine-rich 62 amino acids , Oct-2AN2 ) NHz-terminal regions compared with the wild-type protein ( Fig .

Differential transcriptional activation of the octamer motif by wild-type , mutant , and chimeric Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins .

Cells were treated with TPA and ionomycin and processed for CAT assay as described in Fig .

CAT activities relative to untreated ( basal ) cells transfected with pCG vector are represented .
Basal levels in pCG-transfected cells were 100 + 15 pmol/h/mg protein .
CAT activities were normalized to the levels of transfected Oct proteins ( considering the ratio between the protein levels and the CAT activity described in Fig .
1 , A and B ) and evaluated by EMSA of nuclear extracts from an aliquot of the cells .
Results shown represent the average of three similar experiments ( differing < 20 % from one an-other ) .

Likewise , the antagonistic activity of RA on Oct-2AC was almost lost ( Fig .
2 A ) .
Surprisingly , transfection of the Oct-1 expression vector resulted in repression of the TPA /ionomycin-induced activation of the IL-2-OAP/OCT 1489 de Grazia et al .
tk-CAT construct .
Whereas the Oct-2 COOH terminus was required for enhancer transactivation , the inhibitory activity of Oct-1 also mapped to the COOH terminus , according to data recently reported by Annweiler et al .
( 52 ) for the B cell-specific enhancer stimulation .
In fact , transfection of Oct-1/Oct-2 chimeric constructs indicated that whenever the Oct-1 COOH terminus was present in the fusion protein ( Oct-2.1.1 , Oct-1.2.1 , Oct-2.2.1 ) , the transactivation of the octamer CAT was repressed ( Fig .
2 ) .
Chimeric proteins containing the Oct-1 NH ; terminus with Oct-2 POU domain and COOH terminus ( Oct-1.2.2 ) or Oct-1 POU domain and Oct-2 COOH terminus ( Oct-1.1.2 ) ( transfected over a range of 0.5-5 ug plasmids ) had comparably lower activity than Oct-2 NH : terminus-containing proteins ( Fig .
2 ) .
They were , however , fully antagonized by RA .
All of these data taken together show that an intact Oct-2 COOH-terminus contributes to both the TPA /ionomycin-mediated activation and RA-induced inhibition , suggesting that TPA/calcium and RA signal through an overlapping pathway .
To investigate this pathway , we studied the nuclear factors binding to the octamer motif .
Characterization of the Composite IL-2 Octamer Motif : Presence of an AP-1 Complex and Transcriptional Activation by fos and jun .
- In addition to Oct-1 and Oct-2 , a TPA/calcium-inducible nuclear factor , previously termed OAP '' , has been reported to bind to a region closely linked to the -96 to -66-bp IL-2 octamer-binding site ( 29 ) .
The OAP binding site shares five out of seven nucleotides with a canonical AP1 binding motif ( Fig .
3 A ) .
The complex between the IL-2 octamer motif deleted from the Oct binding site ( OAP/ AOCT ) and nuclear factors extracted from TPA /ionomycin-activated Jurkat T cells was displaced by competition with an excess of either unlabeled collagenase AP-1 ( Fig .
3 B , AP1 Coll ) or the proximal ( ~160 to -139-bp ) AP-1 site of the IL-2 promoter ( not shown ) , which has been shown to bind jun and fos proteins in activated T cells ( 21 , 53 ) .
An unlabeled OAP/AOCT also competed for proteins from activated T cells that bind to an AP-1 site from the collagenase promoter ( Fig .
3 B , OAP ) .
Similar results were observed with HeLa cell nuclear extracts as a source of AP-1 factor ( Fig .
3 B ) .
We also observed that antibodies against both fos and jun proteins were able to bind to the complex formed by nuclear factors ( from both Jurkat and Hela cells ) and the OAP/AOCT sequence motif , whereas an unrelated antibody was uneffec-tive ( Fig .

This result suggests that the protein complex that binds to the OAP/AOCT sequence contains fos and jun family members , which are components of AP-1 .
The OAP/AOCT sequence not only binds an AP-1 factor , but its cis-regulatory function is also activated by jun and fos .
Fig .
4 shows that cotransfection of vectors encoding either c-jun , jun-B , or jun-D with pCG-Oct-2 ( Oct2 ) in the absence of TPA/ionomycin treatment could partially substitute for PKC and calcium-mediated signals in the transactivation of the IL-2-OAP/OCT-tk-CAT reporter .
Similar transactivation was observed by cotransfecting Oct-2 with c-fos or Fos-B , which are likely to form heterodimer complexes with the endogenous jun-D , which has been recently reported - nuclear extract A B $ 0 + 8 o $ cos 40 > o > 4 4 + o > Hela C + 4 + + + +0 + +/+ + 0+ - 4 4 Jurkat £0 .

No significant increase in CAT activity was observed when jun and fos expression vectors were transfected in the absence of the Oct-2 vector ( Fig .

The OAP cis-Element Synergizes with the Oct-2 Octamer Complex and is Negatively Regulated by RAR .
- The ability of fos and jun to synergize with Oct-2 in enhancing the IL-2 octamer motif suggests that both elements may be required to drive transcription .
To address this point , we introduced mutations or deletions in either or both OAP- and OCT -binding sites and tested their cis-regulatory activity on a heterologous tk promoter .
We first studied the binding specificity of these sequences versus OAP , Oct-1 , and Oct-2 proteins by testing their ability to compete for binding to radiolabeled OAP/OCT or OAP/AOCT probes .
Oligonucleotides carrying substitution mutations or a deletion of the OAP binding site ( mOAP/OCT and AOAP/OCT , respectively ) competed , as well as the wild-type OAP/OCT motif for in vitro translated Oct-2 ( Fig .
5 A , lanes 4-6 ) or endogenous Oct-1 ( Fig .
5 B , lanes 2 , 4 , and 5 ) , but they did not bind the OAP factors ( Fig .
5 B , lanes 4 , 5 , 14 , and 15 ) .
Mutations or deletions of the octamer-binding sequence ( OAP/mOCT and OAP/AOCT , respectively ) abolished the DNA-binding ability of Oct-2 and Oct-1 ( Fig .
5 A , lanes 7 and 8 and Fig .
5 B , lane 3 ) , but 1490 they still allowed binding of the OAP factors ( Fig .
5 B , lanes 3 , 12 , and 13 ) .
An analysis of the functional activity of the mutated cis-regulatory motifs indicated that four copies of the double-mutated OAP/OCT element ( m ( OAP/OCT ) -tk-CAT ) , OAP/mOCT ( OAP/mOCT-tk-CAT ) , or OAP/ AOCT ( OAP/AOCT-tk-CAT ) driving CAT expression through a tk promoter were unable to be transactivated by Oct-2 in response to TPA and ionomycin treatment ( Fig .
6 ) .
This result suggests that the AP-1-binding OAP element has weak enhancer activity in the absence of concomitant Oct-2 binding .
The abrogation of OAP binding ( mOAP/OCT -tk-CAT and AOAP/OCT-tk-CAT ) also impaired the ability of the octamer motif to be transactivated by Oct-2 in response to TPA and ionomycin by ~90 % ( Fig .
6 B ) .
This result suggests that Oct-2 has very weak enhancer activity in response to TPA and ionomycin without concomitant AP-1 binding .
Thus , both cis-elements appear to require mutual cooperation for full enhancer properties .
Of further interest is the observation that mutation or deletion of the OAP binding motif almost completely abrogated the ability to RA to antagonize the TPA/ionomycin-induced Oct-2-dependent activation of the IL-2 octamer binding site ; this is probably due to the very low TPA /ionomycin-induced activation ob-served .
Thus , RA inhibition was observed only when both IL-2 Octamer Regulation by Ap-1 , Oct-2 , and RAR TPA+lon vector vector c-jun jun-B , Figure 4 .

RAR has been shown to antagonize the collagenase AP-1 enhancer activity in Hela cells ( 18 , 19 ) .
Thus , a similar RAR-AP-1 antagonism might occur at the IL-2-OAP motif in T cells We therefore studied the effect of RA on the TPA/ionomycin-induced activation of five copies of the collagenase AP-1 cis-element driving CAT transcription through Figure 6 .

For TREp2-CAT , results are expressed as RA-induced fold activation of CAT activity relative to RA-untreated cells .

1492 IL-2 Octamer Regulation by Ap-1 , Oct-2 , and RAR compared with the wild-type receptor on the activity of OAP/OCT -tk-CAT in the presence of CMV-Oct-2 cotransfected into an RA-resistant Jurkat subclone .
Truncation of the NH ; terminus of the receptor did not affect the inhibitory activity on OAP/OCT-tk-CAT expression and only slightly decreased the RA-induced activation of TREp2-CAT reporter , carrying an RA-responsive element driving CAT gene transcription ( Fig .
7 ) .
In contrast , deletion of the receptor DNA-binding domain significantly reduced both RA-mediated repression of the TPA /ionomycin-induced activation of OAP/OCT-tk-CAT and enhancement of TREp2CAT expression ( Fig .
7 ) .
This suggests that direct DNA binding of RARa to the IL-2 sequences may be required for the effect on OAP/OCT cis-regulatory function .
To address this point further , we tested the ability of in vitro syn-thesized , or bacterially expressed , recombinant RARa to bind to the -96 to -66-bp OAP/OCT IL-2 sequences in addition to the RAREB .
According to data previously reported ( 55 , 56 ) , RARa protein acquired RARE DNA-binding activity after complementation with in vitro synthesized RXRa : the presence of the receptor in the complex with RARES was confirmed by use of an anti-RAR antibody ( Fig .
8 C , left panel ) , lanes 4 , 6 , and not shown ) .
Interestingly , the complementation of RAR with nuclear extract from both untreated or TPA /ionomycin-activated Jurkat cells also conferred a distinct pattern of DNA-binding activity , which was supershifted by the anti-RAR antibody ( Fig .
8 C , left panel , lanes 9 , 11 , and not shown ) .
This suggested that , in nuclear extracts , different cofactors were present that cooperate with receptor for DNA binding .
In contrast , complementation with either RXRax or these different putative cofactors present in nuclear extract from both untreated or TPA /ionomycin-activated Jurkat cells was unable to confer the in vitro OAP/OCT motif DNA-binding ability to synthesized or bacterially expressed RARa proteins over a range of salt concentrations or DNA-binding incubation conditions ( Fig .

Discussion Jun and fos Participate in the OAP Octamer Complex and Cooperate with Oct-2 for Transacting Function .
- We report here that Oct-2 is a very weak transactivator of the IL-2 octamer motif in the absence of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore , despite the presence of an active transcriptional activation domain .
This would suggest a requirement for both PKC- and calcium-induced coregulatory signals in T cells .
The requirement of coregulatory signals for Oct-2 transcriptional activity has also been recently reported in B cells .
These signals , which are specific for B cells and absent in HeLa cells , appear to be accounted for by the presence of OCA-B factors , which interact with Oct-2 ( 57 ) .
Similar data have also been reported for EAA , which provides transcription activation function to Oct-4 via protein-protein interaction in embryonic stem cells { 58 ) .
Thus , transactivation properties of Oct-2 and Oct-4 appear to result from the ability of specific cell types to provide cooperating factors that give them functional competence .
In addition to these recently identified coactivators , we report here that another of the cell-specific factors that can cooperate with Oct-2 is the AP-1 complex in T cells We suggest also that the presence of the AP-1 factor underlies the requirement for extracellular regulatory signals ( PKC and calcium ionophore ) in Oct-2-mediated transactivation in T cells .
In this respect , we have further characterized the previously described OAP® complex , which binds to a region closely linked to the octamer motif in the IL-2 promoter ( 29 ) as containing an AP-1 complex .
Our data confirm the recently reported presence of jun in the OAP® complex ( 30 ) .
In addition , we show the presence of immunoreactive fos protein ( s ) in the OAP® complex .
Furthermore , we show that overexpression of jun and fos proteins cooperate with Oct-2 for the transactivation of the IL-2 octamer motif , and that this cooperation is strictly required for full enhancer activity .
The presence of an active transcriptional activation domain within Oct-2 suggests that the ability of AP-1 and other coregulatory factors to impart functional transcriptional competence to Oct-2 does not simply provide a transcriptional domain for a protein that lacks it , as in the case of VP16-Oct-1 interactions ( 13 , 33 ) .
We have mapped a part of the TPA /calcium-induced transacting function of Oct-2 to the COOH terminus , a region rich in heptad leucine repeats with the potential to form a `` leucine zipper -like structure .
It remains to be elucidated whether this region is capable if interacting with leucine zipper 1494 regions in jun and fos proteins .
We also observed differential transactivation of the OAP cis-element by distinct members of the jun and fos family , with jun-B and Fos-B being the most active .
The composition of the AP-1 factors cooperating with distinct transacting factors , such as Oct-1 and Oct-2 , may therefore by influential in determining the transacting function of the final complex .
This may explain the different transactivating function of jun-B reported in this study compared with that described previously ( 30 ) .
Such a selection for AP-1 complexes of different composition has previously been described for AP-1 cooperation with the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) motif of the IL-2 enhancer ( 59-61 ) .
RARa Impairs the Oct-2-dependent AP-1/OAP Function .
Mapping of the Oct-2 domains required for TPA/calcium-induced activation function revealed that they overlapped the region required for negative regulation by RARa « .
This suggests that a focus for both activator and inhibitor signals may occur on a unique pathway .
We show here that this pathway could be represented by the AP-1 complex .
Abrogation of AP-1 binding to the OAP cis-element blunted the antagonistic activity of RAR .
An indirect modulation of IL-2 promoter by RAR on AP-1/OAP function was suggested by the requirement for the receptor DNA-binding domain but not direct in vitro binding to the IL-2 octamer motif and by the ability of RARa « to inhibit the AP-1 binding activity to the IL-2-OAP/OCT sequence in vitro .
A similar mechanism has been proposed for RAR antagonism of collagenase AP-1 cis-element by an inhibition of the AP-1 complex DNA-binding activity in HeLa cells independently from direct RAR binding to DNA ( 18 , 19 , 62 ) .
We used a similar model to demonstrate inhibition of TPA-induced activation of collagenase AP-1 cis-regulatory activity by RARa « x in T cells .
Therefore , although the in vivo binding of RAR to the OAP/OCT motif can not be ruled out , the ability of the receptor to inhibit the OAP binding activity without direct DNA binding in vitro , presented here , is sufficient to suggest that RAR inhibits the functional synergism between AP-1 and Oct factors by preventing the binding of jun and fos to the OAP binding site .
An appropriate genetic context for AP-1 regulation seems to be required , as RA does not interfere with the activity of the AP-1 complex found in the NFAT element of IL-2 enhancer ( 23 , 63 ) .
Our data leave open , however , the question of the potential contribution of Oct factors in the negative regulation of AP-1 sites by RAR and their potential interaction with the receptor .
In this respect , it should be noted that protein-protein interactions have been implicated in both the antagonism of Oct-2 function by glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ; 64 ) and the synergism between GR and Oct-1 ( 65 ) .
It is of further interest that the repression of the IL-2-OAP/ OCT motif by RA , described here , is not without similarity to a recent report describing RAR-mediated interference with the activation of the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide enhancer by cell-specific helix-loop-helix and octamer proteins in combination ( 66 ) .
Another nuclear receptor ( GR ) has been described to cause a similar impairment of the functional cooperation between distinct cis-elements ( AP-1 and NFAT ) in the IL-2 enhancer ( 21 ) .
II:2 Octamer Regulation by Ap-1 , Oct-2 , and RAR Multiple Pathways of AP-1 Regulation : Implications for T Cell Development .
- Octamer-binding proteins containing homeo-domains are developmentally regulated and involved in the cascade of events controlling morphogenic processes ( 14 ) .
As RA regulates octamer-binding proteins ( 9-12 ) and IL-2 is active in T cell development ( 25 , 26 ) , it is possible that RAR and octamer-binding factors might combine to modulate thymocyte differentiation through regulation of cytokine gene transcription .
This hypothesis is consistent with our observation that RA can modulate T cell precursor development in an in vitro thymocyte differentiation system ( 67 , 68 ) .
To extend this hypothesis , the data described here and elsewhere ( 30 , 59-61 , 63 ) suggest a central role for AP-1 sites in the functional organization of the IL-2 enhancer , which is com posed of several regulatory modules , including an AP-1 site that potentially cooperates with another closely linked transacting factor-binding motif .
This site may well be responsible for differential regulation by external stimuli .
The role of AP-1 in regulating Oct-2 and mediating RAR activity would strongly suggest that it may also contribute to the T cell differentiation process .
Support for this comes from observations that changes in the AP-1 pathway accompany the induction of T cell tolerance ( 69 ) and thymocyte ontogeny ( 70 ) .
As AP-1 responds to a broad range of activating stimuli , often unrelated to differentiation pathways , this transcription factor may provide signals that specify developmental programs on the basis of selective functional interactions with differentiation-related transacting factors .
