The EMBO Journal Vol.18 No.2 pp.411-419 , 1999 Intranuclear targeted delivery of functional NF-xB by 70 kDa heat shock protein Sheri M.Fujihara and Steven G.Nadler ' Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute , PO Box 4000 , Princeton , NJ 08543 , USA *Corresponding author e-mail : nadlers @ bms.com The 70 kDa heat shock protein ( Hsp70 ) is a highly conserved , ubiquitous protein involved in chaperoning proteins to various cellular organelles .
Here we show that when added exogenously to cells , Hsp70 is readily imported into both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in a cell-type-specific fashion .
We exploited this ability of Hsp70 to deliver NF-KB , a key transcriptional regulator of inflammatory responses .
We demonstrate that a fusion protein composed of a C-terminal Hsp70 peptide and the p50 subunit of NF-KB was directed into the nucleus of cells , could bind DNA specifically , and activated Ig expression and TNF production .
We therefore propose that Hsp70 can be used as a vehicle for intracytoplasmic and intranuclear delivery of proteins or DNA to modulate gene expression and thereby control immune responses .
Keywords : Hsp70/heat shock protein/NF- « xB/nuclear transport/protein delivery Introduction Heat shock proteins ( Hsps ) are a family of molecular chaperone proteins that have long been known to play essential roles in a multitude of intra- and intercellular processes , including protein synthesis and folding , vesicular trafficking , and antigen processing and presentation .
Hsps are among the most highly conserved proteins known and carry out many of their regulatory activities via protein-protein interactions .
Since one of the most well-characterized functions of Hsp70 is to assist in the translocation of proteins across intracellular membranes into different compartments of the cell , we were interested to find out whether this property of Hsp70 could be utilized to deliver proteins across the plasma and nuclear membranes .
Intracellular transport activity has been reported for viral proteins such as the HSV-1 structural protein VP22 ( Elliott and O'Hare , 1997 ) and the HIV Tat protein ( Vives et al. , 1997 ) , as well as peptide sequences derived from Antennapedia homeodomain , fibroblast growth factor ( Hawiger , 1997 ) and most recently the neuropeptide galanin ( Pooga et al. , 1998 ) .
Delivery of protein substrates has been demonstrated by some of these transport peptides as well ( Fawell et al. , 1994 ; Phelan et al. , 1998 ; Rojas et al. , 1998 ) .
Data suggesting that Hsp70 is able to cross the plasma membrane have come from a number of studies over the past few years , which characterize the nature © European Molecular Biology Organization of Hsps in generating protective immunity .
A series of recent studies ( Romain and Moreno , 1996 ; Suzue and Young , 1996 ) demonstrated that bacterial Hsp70 could be used as an adjuvant-free carrier protein to enable its bound peptide or protein substrate to enter the endosomal compartment and subsequently access the MHC class II processing pathway for exogenous antigens .
In these experiments it was shown that immunization of mice with Hsp70-peptide complexes or Hsp70 fusion proteins could elicit cargo-specific proliferative T cell responses in the spleen .
However , other experiments in which cancer-cell-derived Hsp70 used to immunize mice resulted in specific anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses ( Udono and Srivastava , 1993 ) suggested that the Hsps were using the endogenous MHC class I processing pathway .
These studies indicate that Hsps can transit not only through endosomes , but into the cytoplasm as well .
Early studies by Hightower and Guidon ( 1989 ) , which reported the release of Hsps from cultured newborn rat cells by a non-heat shock-dependent mechanism , support the observation that some Hsp family members can cross the plasma membranes of certain cells .
Although these studies imply a plasma membrane translocation capacity for Hsp70 , such an activity has not been demonstrated directly .
In this report we present direct evidence that the Hsp70 protein , Hsp70-derived peptides and chimeric proteins composed of Hsp70 peptides fused to the p50 subunit of NF-KB can all translocate across cell membranes to rapidly gain cytoplasmic and nuclear entry .
Though cellular import activity has been reported for various diverse peptides , intranuclear transport generally requires the presence of specific nuclear localization sequences ( NLS ) .
While heat shock is known to induce increased synthesis and nuclear translocation of endogenous heat shock protein following heat shock factor ( HSF ) activation , we show that nuclear localization of exogenous heat shock protein can result without prior heat shock .
Since the majority of the peptide binding and regulatory functionality of Hsp70 resides in the C-terminus , we focused on this region for our studies .
We found that the transport and nuclear localization properties of Hsp70 were retained within a 90 amino acid C-terminal fragment , and our subsequent experiments utilized this fragment as well as one encompassing a larger portion of the peptide-binding domain .
Our data suggest that this C-terminal domain of Hsp70 contains a novel NLS .
To our knowledge , this is the first report to establish the ability of exogenous Hsp70 fusion proteins to cross the cell membrane , gain nuclear entry and exert a biological function .
These data indicate that Hsp70 would present an ideal candidate for delivery of molecules with biological function into both cellular and nuclear compartments .

Results Hsp70-mediated transport is cell-type specific Recombinant human Hsp70 protein was generated for use in the following experiments .
To investigate the 412 intracellular localization of exogenously added Hsp70 , we fluorescently labeled the full-length Hsp70 protein and tested its ability to become internalized by various cell types .
Cells were typically treated with a final concentration of 10 ug/ml Hsp70-fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) [ or bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) -FITC as a control ] for 1 h , then washed and fixed prior to confocal laser scanning microscopy .
The bulk of the intracellular Hsp70-FITC localized uniformly to the nucleus and cytoplasm in murine pre-B 70Z % /3 cells , whereas import of BSA-FITC was negligible ( Figure 1A and B ) .
We also observed significant uptake of Hsp70-FITC but not BSA-FITC by human peripheral blood monocytes ( Figure 1C and D ) .
The uptake by peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) appeared to be specific for monocytes as opposed to B cells , as we observed intracellular staining only in cells which were CD14* ( Figure 1C ) , and not in CD19+* ( Figure 1E ) .
In addition , we did not observe uptake by peripheral blood T cells ( Figure 1F ) .
Interestingly , while the staining pattern in peripheral blood monocytes was often uniform throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus , we noted that it was sometimes characterized by punctate staining , implying vesicular localization within the cytoplasm .
We found that the specific staining pattern of the PBLs varied by donor , suggesting that the state of cell activation may play a role in uptake efficiency or intracellular localization of exogenous Hsp70 .
Consistent with this hypothesis , we found that while resting peripheral blood B cells were resistant to Hsp70 uptake , they could be induced to transport the protein after 48 h of activation in vitro with anti-CD40 plus anti-immunoglobulin ( Ig ) antibodies ( data not shown ) .
This method of B cell activation is known to result in the expression of various differentiation- and proliferation-associated genes .
In contrast , activation of peripheral blood T cells by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies did not affect Hsp70 transport ( data not shown ) .
No intracellular uptake was observed by Jurkat T cell or HeLa cell lines , but we did observe uptake by several mature B cell lines , including Ramos , RAJI and BJAB ( data not shown ) .
In addition , we saw limited cytoplasmic uptake by two monocytic cell lines , THP-1 and U937 , but only after extended ( 6-24 h ) incubation with high concentrations ( 100 ug/ml ! )
of Hsp70-FITC ( data not shown ) .
The B cell- and monocyte-specific Hsp70 transport activity we describe is consistent with reports which propose a role for Hsp70 heat shock family members in antigen presentation ( Vanbuskirk et al. , 1989 ; Manara et al. , 1993 ) , as these cells are generally considered to function as antigen-presenting cells .
The cell-type specificity and inducibility of cellular Hsp70 uptake may reflect differential expression of a required surface or nuclear receptor for the Hsp70 protein .
Studies are now in progress to investigate the surface proteins which may be involved in the binding and internalization of extracellular Hsp70 .
Kinetics of Hsp70 cellular uptake We next investigated the time course and dose-effect of Hsp70 uptake by 70 % /3 cells .
From these studies we determined that the internalization process appears to be slow , since maximal internalization is not achieved until between 6 and 8 h after addition of Hsp70 ( Figure 2A ) , and it remains constant for up to 2 days of incubation .
For the dose range study , varying amounts of Hsp70-FITC were incubated with the cells for 1 h. Our analysis showed that the intensity of intracellular fluorescence increased with increasing concentrations of extracellular Hsp70 , up to 100 ug/ml ( 1.4 uM ) , and was detectable even when Intracellular Hsp70 delivery 60000 50000 40000 Lz 22 + I } j [ 4+ 30000 / 20000 WK | | ﬂ ?

Uptake of Hsp70 is time- and concentration-dependent .
( A ) Kinetics of uptake of Hsp70-FITC by 702/3 cells .
Cells ( 510° ) were incubated at 37°C for increasing periods of time with 1 uM Hsp70-FITC , washed , and analyzed in a fluorimeter .
The data curve was fitted by a modified regression program ( XLfit ) .
( B ) Dose-effect of Hsp70 on uptake by 702/3 cells .
The cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h with various concentrations of Hsp70-FITC , then washed and analyzed as in ( A ) .
cells were treated with levels as low as 0.1 ug/ml ( 1.4 nM ; Figure 2B ) .
We determined that treatment of cells with an extracellular concentration of 1 uM Hsp70-FITC resulted after 1 h of incubation in an intracellular concentration of 700 nM , assuming a volume of 1 pl/cell .
This uptake efficiency is comparable to that reported for other intracellular targeting peptide sequences ( Phelan et al. , 1998 ) .
The uptake of Hsp70-FITC was not saturable in the concentration range we used ( 35 nM-1 uM ) , consistent with a high capacity receptor-mediated or non-receptor-mediated uptake mechanism .
In addition , internalization by 70Z/3 cells could not be blocked by preincubation with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled Hsp70 .
However , we did observe inhibition of internalization using excess Hsp70 with cells that are less efficient at uptake , such as Ramos and U937 ( data not shown ) .
Mechanism of Hsp70-mediated intracellular transport To investigate the mechanism of transport , we examined the import of Hsp70 under various conditions .
Full-length Hsp70 protein was transported by PBLs in the presence of 0.05 % sodium azide , an inhibitor of oxidative phospho-rylation , to nearly the same extent as control cells ( Figure 3 , compare A with B ) .
However , this transport activity 413 S.M.Fujihara and S $ .G.Nadler & Fig .

Intracellular uptake of Hsp70-FITC was minimally affected by azide but was inhibited at 4°C .
Peripheral blood lymphocyte cells in ( A-D ) were stained with anti-CD14-PE as a monocyte marker .
Cells were either untreated ( A ) or pretreated for 30 min with 0.05 % sodium azide ( B ) before incubation with 10 ug/ml Hsp70-FITC for 1 h at 37°C , or were pre-incubated at 4°C for 30 min prior to addition of Hsp70-FITC and an additional 1 h of incubation at 4°C ( C ) .
( D ) BSA-FITC added to cells for 1 h at 37°C as a control .
Internalized Hsp70-FITC did not colocalize with transferrin .

FITC-labeled fusion proteins consisting of either the C-terminal 245 ( Hsp70/28-p50 ) or 92 ( Hsp70/10-p50 ) amino acids of Hsp70 fused to p50 were transported into 702/3 cells .
702/3 cells were treated with 10 ug/ml full-length Hsp70-FITC ( A ) , Hsp70/28-p50-FITC ( B ) , Hsp70/10-p50-FITC ( C ) , or BSA-FITC as a control ( D ) for 1 h at 37°C as described in the Materials and methods .
Intracellular localization of fusion proteins was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy .
occurred in separate intracellular compartments in both 702/3 cells ( Figure 3E ) and in human PBLs ( data not shown ) , suggested that this mechanism does not involve classical endocytosis .
However , we can not rule out the possibility that Hsps are transported via a novel endocytic mechanism .
An exogenous NF- « xB C-terminal Hsp70 fusion protein can be directed to the nucleus Two different fusion proteins composed of either a 245 or a 92 amino acid Hsp70 C-terminal polypeptide fused to the p50 subunit of the transcription factor NF-KB were generated to examine the ability of the Hsp70 peptide sequence to direct other protein substrates into the cell .
When added exogenously to cells , both FITC-conjugated fusion proteins entered the cytoplasm and nuclei of cells ( Figure 4 ) and PBLs ( data not shown ) with kinetics and specificity similar to the Hsp70 peptide alone .
Internalized FITC-Hsp70 remained stable for 24 h after washout of unincorporated protein and incubation at 37°C , as determined by confocal microscopy and SDS-PAGE analysis .
To assess protein stability , cells were pulsed with either 10 ug/ml FITC-conjugated full-length Hsp70 or Hsp70/28-p50 for 1 h prior to washing and a chase at 37°C for up to 96 h. Gel electrophoresis showed the presence of both the ~75 kDa fusion protein as well as full-length Hsp70 itself ( distinguishable from endogenous Hsp70 by its fluorescent tag ) in whole-cell extracts after up to 24 h of incubation without measurable change in size or appearance of smaller molecular weight degradation products ( Figure 5 ) .
These data suggest that intracellular targeted Hsp70 and Hsp70-p50 fusion protein was stable , and remained within the cell without significant degradation with a half-life of > 24 h. 415 S.M.Fujihara and S $ .G.Nadler A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 MW ( kD ) 97 66 goers ques gorse @ name s+ « s s tae ot ps hs 30 21 foe Set B 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 MW ( kD ) a7 66 - '' ' : '' . : : '' . ” '..-'.

Transported NF-xB p50 exhibits DNA-binding activity We could show that purified fusion proteins were able to bind x DNA ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the p50 subunits were not conformationally impaired by the presence of the Hsp70 sequences .
To address whether the internalized fusion proteins retained functional activity , we tested nuclear extracts of Hsp70-p50 fusion protein-treated cells for their ability to bind a specific k DNA sequence .
After 70Z/3 cells were treated with LPS , Hsp70/ 10-p50 or Hsp70/28-p50 for 1 h , nuclear extracts were prepared and gel-shift assays were performed .
We found that DNA-binding activity was retained by the fusion protein after nuclear uptake by cells , indicating that the import process did not result in significant degradation or loss of activity ( Figure 6A ) .
This DNA-binding activity was specific , as the complex was largely competed with an excess of unlabeled NF-KB sequence but not with the consensus sequence for octamer-binding protein ( Figure 6A ) .
We saw distinct complexes formed by nuclear extracts from cells treated with different fusion proteins ; further-more , they differed from the complex formed by LPS 416 5 A o 2 oo |p & £8 $ 1 c C U 5 @ °f $ 39 ® S6 0 0 a a Eggg a a 5 Gz t 55 iA- 18 B LPS Hsp70/28-50 ar -- - toa none « p50 « p65 « c-rel « Hsp70 none « p50 « p65 « c-rel « HSP-70 # ! v ' w\s Fig .

induced endogenous NF-KB .
In supershift experiments we observed that anti-p50 antibodies were able to shift nearly the entire DNA-binding complex from fusion protein-treated cells , as expected , confirming that the fusion protein was probably binding to DNA mainly as a homo-dimer ( Figure 6B ) .
We also observed a detectable decrease in the specific complex upon incubation with both anti-p65 and anti-Hsp70 ( directed against the C-terminal four amino acids EEVD ) antibodies , indicating the presence of endogenous p65 subunits in addition to recombinant Hsp70-p50 subunits .
In contrast , nuclear extracts from control LPS-treated cells formed a complex containing both p50 and p65 subunits , and the supershifted patterns differed from the cells treated with the fusion protein .
These data indicate that distinct protein-DNA complexes were formed and suggest that the fusion proteins were binding DNA directly and not simply activating endogenous NF-KB .

Hsp70-p50-activated surface Igx expression and TNFQ production .

which interact with NF-KB DNA binding sites in cells , we decided to evaluate downstream biological events in the NF-KB pathway .
We observed that treatment of various cells with the Hsp70-p50 fusion proteins resulted in activation of several inflammatory and immunological responses normally regulated by NF-KB .
Treatment of mouse 70Z/3 pre-B cells with Hsp70/10-p50 fusion protein was shown to be as effective as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in inducing high levels of kappa Ig ( Igx ) light chain on the surface ( Figure 7A ) .
In addition , in contrast to LPS-induced activation , the fusion protein-induced surface expression was abolished by 30 min of 65°C heat denatura-tion of the protein prior to treatment of cells , confirming that native protein was required for the activation .
Similar results were obtained with Hsp70/28-p50 ( data not shown ) .
TNF production is another example of an inflammatory response also predominantly regulated by NF-KB .
We observed that the internalized fusion protein was also able to induce TNF production by human PBLs ( Figure 7B ) .
Freshly isolated PBL s were incubated with LPS or Hsp70-p50 for 6 h , after which time supernatants were collected and tested for cytokine levels by ELISA .
Again , we found the fusion proteins to be as effective as LPS in inducing TNF production , and established that intact protein was responsible for activation by showing that heat denatura-tion of the fusion protein abolished the effect .
Discussion In this report we have shown that exogenously added heat shock protein Hsp70 is internalized by cells into both Intracellular Hsp70 delivery the cytoplasm and nucleus in a cell-type-specific manner .
The intracellular transport appears to be temperature dependent , and occurs over a time course extending to 6-8 h. The transport-mediating domain can be localized to the C-terminus of Hsp70 , and can be used to target an extracellular NF-KB protein to the nucleus where it can bind DNA and activate gene expression .
Although the mechanism of uptake is unknown , the data suggest that the binding and internalization of Hsp70 may involve a high capacity receptor .
Hsp70 does not appear to be internalized via the classical endocytic route since it does not co-localize with transferrin and is quite stable intracellularly ; therefore , it is probably not transiting through lysosomes .
We did observe differences in internalization of Hsp70 by different cell lines , exemplified by the distinct patterns of staining in pre-B cells as opposed to the monocytic U937 cells .
Guzhova et a/ .
( 1998 ) previously reported Hsp70 internalization by U937 cells , which they suggest utilize a mechanism involving patching and capping .
While we occasionally observed internalization of Hsp70 by U937 that could be described as patching and capping , we also noted a more uniform fluorescence indicative of intracytoplasmic and intranuclear accumulation .
On 70Z/3 cells we saw no evidence of patching , suggesting that the uptake mechanism in these cells is different from that in U937 cells .
Identification of an Hsp70 receptor on the cell surface will yield more information on the mechanism of Hsp70-mediated transport .
To our surprise , we found that treatment of cells with the Hsp70-p50 fusion protein induced transactivation , as evidenced by the increase in surface K expression and TNF production .
NF-KB p50 homodimers are commonly thought to act as transcriptional repressors in most cell types due to the absence of a C-terminal activation domain .
There are a number of possible explanations for the lack of an observed dominant negative effect of the Hsp70-p50 fusion protein on transcriptional activation .
First , the heat shock protein sequence , specifically the EEVD domain , may itself possess transactivation activity .
Hsp70 is known to bind HSF in the nucleus and interfere with its transactivation activity via the EEVD domain .
Since the Hsp70 sequence in our study was fused C-terminal to the p50 sequence , the EEVD domain is potentially available to provide transactivation , or even to interact with other cellular or nuclear cofactors .
Closer analysis of the nuclear complex may yield clues as to other possible components with transcriptional activities .
Secondly , p50 homodimers may simply exhibit transactivation activity in certain circumstances .
Fujita et al .
( 1992 ) tested the various homo- and heterodimers of NF-KB subunits for transcriptional activation in vitro and determined that addition of p50 alone to some transcription mixtures resulted in significant transcriptional stimulation .
They attributed this activation to differences in the fine structure of the nucleotide sequence within the KB motifs .
Interestingly , this group observed a 4-fold stimulation of transcription by p30 homodimers over control using the IgKk sequence motif .
These data would correspond to the activation we observed in studies analyzing surface Igxk expression .
Thirdly , the Hsp70-p50 subunits may be recruiting other transactivating factors into the DNA-binding complex that we have not yet detected .
We are 417 S.M.Fujihara and S $ .G.Nadler currently investigating the mechanism by which the fusion protein is activating transcription .
In addition to its ability to deliver NF-KB , the intracellular and intranuclear uptake of Hsp70 itself may have in vivo relevance .
The observation that cell surface-associated and secreted forms of Hsp70 exist ( Multhoff and Hightower , 1996 ) suggests that this protein may function in cell-cell communication , perhaps as a means of transferring cellular protection from environmental stressors by regulating transcription .
In fact , several recent reports have described a physical interaction of Hsp70 with the transactivation domains of several transcription factors within the nucleus .
For example , Hsp70 can bind directly to the transactivation domains of both HSF ( Shi et al. , 1998 ) , resulting in inhibition of gene transcription , and Wilms tumor suppressor ( Maheswaran et al. , 1998 ) , resulting in suppression of cellular proliferation .
These data and others implicate a role for Hsp70 in the regulation of transcription factors and possibly other nuclear proteins .
These data also complement others which have shown that Hsp70 , as a cytoplasmic chaperone , can interact with transcription factors such as NF-KB itself , as well as a myriad of cofactors such as Hip , Hop , Hsp40 , Hsp90 , BAG-1 and others ( Demand et al. , 1998 ) .
Indeed , release and intercellular transfer of exported Hsp70 has been reported in cultured newborn rat cells ( Hightower and Guidon , 1989 ) , and accumulation of Hsp70 in a variety of human cell lines either by heat shock or by liposomal transfer has been shown to increase cell survival and protect from apoptotic cell death ( Lasunskaia et al. , 1997 ) .
Release of heat shock proteins from cells under harsh or damaging conditions may be a homeostatic mechanism for transfer of a protective stress response to neighboring cells that are unable to mount such a response .
In addition , recent reports describing the ability of peptide-bound Hsp70 molecules to induce antitumor or antiviral immunity as well as the development of memory CTLs support the notion that these proteins might function to convey a protective immune response by providing an antigen-presentation function ( Blachere et al. , 1997 ; Ciupitu et al. , 1998 ) .
We envision a scheme whereby endogenous Hsp70 ( and associated peptides or proteins ) are released into the environment by infected or apoptosing cells .
These Hsp70 protein complexes would subsequently become available to neighboring cells , which may be compromised in their immune capacity , and act as a stimulus to boost or strengthen the immune response .
We demonstrate the effective cellular and nuclear uptake as well as long-term intracellular stability of exogenously supplied Hsp70 fusion proteins by several cell types .
This rapid and stable transport activity has important implications for the utility of Hsp70-derived peptides as a vehicle for delivering therapeutic agents to the cytoplasm and nucleus , where they remain localized for long periods of time .
As manipulation of the nuclear import process in particular becomes an increasingly interesting target for regulated control of gene expression ( Fujihara and Nadler , 1998 ) , we believe that future emphasis will be placed on developing more potent means of intracellular targeted delivery .
The use of Hsp70 as a delivery system has a number of advantages over other previously described protein candidates , including the fact that the protein is of human origin and therefore does not contain foreign 418 ( i.e .
viral , bacterial or insect ) and potentially immunogenic material .
As Hsp70 is a highly expressed and abundant protein , it would probably be well-tolerated in humans .
In addition , the cell-type specificity we observed and the demonstration by others that it plays a role in immune responses might allow the targeting of compounds to specific cells of the immune system for more effective regulatory control .
Finally , the preferential and long-lived nuclear-directed delivery of protein substrates may provide protection from cytoplasmic proteolysis .
Our data support the potential use of Hsp70 sequences as a novel tool for delivery of molecules such as proteins or DNA that modulate gene expression .
Materials and methods Expression and purification of the Hsp70-p50 fusion proteins Two p50 fusion proteins were constructed using the nucleotide sequence corresponding to amino acids 1-406 of the NF-KB p105 subunit protein .
This sequence includes the DNA-binding domain as well as the Rel homology domain .
The two fusion proteins varied in the length of Hsp70 fragment used .
The two Hsp70 sequences ( DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No .
M59828 ) were both derived from the C-terminus , including either the terminal 276 or 735 nucleotides , which correspond to a 10 and a 28 kDa protein fragment .
Either the 10 or the 28 kDa Hsp70 protein was fused C-terminal to the p50 protein , and the resulting fusion proteins were denoted Hsp70/10-p50 or Hsp70/28-p50 , respectively .
The prokaryotic expression vector ProEX HT ( Life Technologies ) was used for cloning , expression in E.coli DHS59 cells and purification according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
All FITC conjugations were performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate .
Proteins to be conjugated were incubated with FITC for 30 min at room temperature , and unconjugated FITC was separated from labeled protein by gel filtration .
Cells and antibodies Pre-B 702/3 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and B-mercaptoethanol .
PBLs were prepared from healthy donors by Ficoll gradient centrifugation , and T cells were separated from monocytes and B cells in this fraction by rosetting with sheep red blood cells .
Anti-CD14 and anti-CD19 antibodies were purchased from Becton Dickenson , and anti-K antibodies were purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates , Inc. Confocal laser scanning microscopy Cells were typically treated with 10 ug/ml FITC-conjugated proteins or as indicated in the text for 1 h at 37°C followed by a wash in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , fixation in 2 % paraformaldehyde , and an additional wash in PBS .
Samples were examined with a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope using Molecular Dynamics LaserSharp and Adobe Photoshop software .
Fluorescence analysis of imported Hsp70-p50 fusion proteins Cells were treated with 10 pig/ml FITC-conjugated proteins for 1 h at 37°C , washed in PBS and used for preparation of nuclear extracts .
Equal protein amounts were separated by SDS-PAGE .
The gel was fixed in acetic acid and subject to fluorescence analysis by Fluorimager SI and ImageQuant software ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay Nuclear extracts from 702/3 cells were prepared using a modification of established protocols ( Tepper ef al. , 1995 ) .
Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay , and an NF-KB ( 5 -GAT-CCGAGGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGG-3 ' ) oligonucleotide ( Promega , Madison , WI ) was end labeled with [ 7—32P ] ATP and T4 kinase .
The conditions for binding reactions with oligonucleotide probes were as described previously .
Supershift assays were performed with NF-KB p50 , p65 and c-Rel polyclonal antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechno-logy ) and Hsp70 antibody ( a polyclonal antibody generated at BMS , Seattle , WA , and known to be directed against the Hsp70 C-terminal EEVD amino acid sequence ) by pre-incubating the nuclear extracts with 3 ul of the antibody in the reaction buffer for 30 min followed by EMSA analysis .
Competition experiments were performed using unlabeled NF-KB and octamer ( 5'-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3 ' ) oligo-nucleotides .
Samples were analyzed on native 6 % polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed .
Immunofluorescence assay ( FACS ) 70Z/3 cells were treated with either 30 ug/ml Hsp70/10-p50 fusion protein or 10 ng/ml LPS and incubated overnight at 37°C .
Cells were then washed in PBS and fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde prior to staining with FITC-conjugated anti- antibody .
After an additional PBS wash , cells were subjected to imaging and analysis on the FACStar ( Becton Dickenson ) .
TNFa : assay Human PBLs were isolated as previously described and treated with 40 ug/ml Hsp70 fusion protein or 5 ng/ml LPS for 6 h. Supernatants were collected and analyzed for TNFa by ELISA ( Genzyme ) .
