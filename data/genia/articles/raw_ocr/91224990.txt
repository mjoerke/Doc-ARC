Tissue-specific Expression of the Platelet GPIIb Gene* ( Received for publication , January 8 , 1991 ) Georges Uzan , Michel Prenant , Marie-Héléene Prandini , Florence Martin , and Gérard Marguerie From the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale U217 , Laboratoire d'Hématologie , Departement de Biologie Moléculaire et Structurale , Centre d'Etudes Nucléaires , 38041 Grenoble , France One of the major objectives in the study of thrombo-genesis is to determine the mechanisms by which a hematopoietic progenitor is activated and committed to the megakaryocytic lineage .
Recent development of primary cultures of human megakaryocytes and the molecular cloning of genes that are specific to this lineage offer the possibility of getting some insights into the genetic mechanisms that control megakaryocytopoiesis .
One gene of interest is the glycoprotein IIb ( GPIIb ) gene ; GPIIb , the a subunit of the platelet cytoadhesin GPIIb-IIIa , is produced in megakaryocytes at an early stage of the differentiation , whereas the other subunit of this complex , GPIIIa , is expressed in other cells .
For these reasons , the 5'-flanking region of the GP IIb gene was used to identify the regions that interact with DNA-binding nuclear factors .
A fragment extending from -643 to +33 is capable of controlling the tissue-specific expression of the CAT gene in transfection experiments .
Within this region , we have identified several sequences that are implicated in DNA protein interactions as shown in DNAse I footprints and gel mobility shift assays .
One region , centered at -54 , is similar to a nuclear factor El-binding site , and a region located at position -233 contains a CCAAT motif .
Two domains centered at positions -345 and -540 , respectively , bind proteins that are present in megakaryocytic cells and nonrelated cells as well .
Finally , two other domains , located at positions -460 and -510 , interact with proteins that are only present in megakaryocytic cells .
In addition , deletion of the region containing these two domains results in a significant decrease of the promoter activity .
It is very likely that these domains bind megakaryocyte-specific nuclear proteins acting as positive transcription factors .
A central objective in hematopoiesis is to identify the factors that control the commitment of a progenitor cell to a specific lineage .
Over the past decade , remarkable progress has been made concerning the role of hematopoietic factors and oncogene products in the differentiation or proliferation of hematopoietic cells ( 1 ) .
Little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of specific genes that are implicated in the differentiation process .
Within the hematopoietic system , the megakaryocytic lineage is difficult to study because megakaryocytes represent a very small percentage of the total marrow cells .

ment of liquid culture of human megakaryocytes ( 2 ) , clonal cultures of murine and human hematopoietic stem cells ( 8 , 4 ) , and the characterization of an increasing number of permanent cell lines with defined megakaryocytic features ( 5-8 ) , analysis of megakaryocytopoiesis at the molecular level now becomes feasible .
One way to approach this question is to examine the regulation of the expression of a marker gene that is both highly specific to the lineage and expressed at an early step during the differentiation process .
The gene coding for the platelet glycoprotein IIb appears to fulfill these crite-ria .
GPIIb ' is the a subunit of the platelet RGD-sensitive integrin GPIIb-IIIa , which functions as a specific receptor for fibrinogen , fibronectin , and von Willebrand 's factor ( 9-13 ) .
While the 8 subunit ( GPIHHa ) of this integrin is expressed in different cells , including megakaryocytes ( 14 ) , endothelial cells ( 15 ) , macrophages ( 16 , 17 ) , and fibroblastic cells ( 18 ) , the GP IIb mRNA seems to be produced only in megakaryocytes .
The protein is synthesized as a precursor , and its processing is controlled by an early assembly with GPIIIa ( 19 , 20 ) .
Different reports from independent groups have suggested that GPIIb is an early marker for megakaryocytopoiesis .
Rabellino et al .
( 21 ) have initially reported the expression of the IIb-IIla complex in early megakaryocytic cells .
Based on cytotoxicity experiments , Berridge et al .
( 22 ) and Fraser et al .
( 23 ) have provided evidence that GPIIb is expressed in the murine and the human hematopoietic stem cell .
Using the same approach , Levene et al .
( 24 ) have concluded that GPIIb-IIIa is expressed in the colony-forming unit megakaryocyte .
These conclusions were , however , more recently challenged by Kanz et al .
( 25 ) .
Based on immunologic labeling and cell sorting , these authors have concluded that the 8 subunit of the complex , GPIIIa , is not present in the progenitor cells .
It may , however , be argued that flow cytom-etry is a less sensitive method than cytotoxicity at detecting surface-exposed glycoproteins .
Nevertheless , there is ample evidence to suggest that GP IIb is an early and specific marker for megakaryocytopoiesis .
We have obtained cDNA clones containing the complete sequence of GPIIb from human megakaryocyte ( 26 , 27 ) and isolated the gene encoding this protein ( 28 ) .
This gene spans a region of 17.2 kb ( 29 ) and is located on chromosome 17 at position q21-23 ( 30 , 31 ) .
We now show that the promoter region of this gene contains positive responsive elements for a tissue-specific expression and multiple binding sites for specific and ubiquitous nuclear proteins . '

8932 Expression of Platelet GP IIb Gene MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA Probes-A 1.9-kb EcoRI fragment containing the transcription initiation start site and 1.6 kb of the flanking region of the GPIIb gene was subcloned in the PGEM.1 plasmid ( 28 ) .
This fragment was further digested with Mbol to generate a Mbol-Mbol segment containing the genomic sequence from nucleotide +33 to -1040 .
All the other DNA fragments for DNase I-footprinting assays were derived from this 1.08-kb fragment using the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) .
Each PCR fragment was sequenced and labeled with [ *P ] ATP using polynucleotide kinase , cut with selected restriction enzymes to generate one end-labeled fragment , and isolated .
The synthetic oligonucleotides used in mobility shift assays were prepared with an Applied Biosystem DNA synthesizer .
The first strand was 5 end-labeled and annealed with an excess of the nonlabeled second strand at a 1:4 ratio to optimize annealing .
The following oligonucleotides were used as competitors .
The CAAT -binding site from the « -globin gene was 5-TCCGCGCCAGCCAATGAG-3 ' ( 32 ) ; the HNF1-binding site from the fibrinogen $ gene was 5'-GATCT-CAAATGT CAAATATTAACTAAAGGGAG-3 ' ( 33 ) ; the consensus spl-binding site from the SV40 early promoter was 5'-TAGTCCCGCCCCTAAC TCCGCCCATCCCG-3 ' ( 34 ) ; and the NF-El-binding site from the murine a-globin gene was 5-GATCTCCGGGCAACTGATAAGGATTCCCTG-3 ' ( 35 ) .
All the fragments were verified on acrylamide gels , and the DNA concentration was established by comparison with digested E. coli DNA and optical density measurement at 260 nm .
Cells and Nuclear Extracts-Nuclear extracts were prepared from the following cells : HeLa , HEL , Raji , U937 , HL60 , and human megakaryocytes .
All the cell lines were grown for 24 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
Human megakaryocytes were isolated and cultured for 10 days according to the method previously described in detail ( 2 ) .
The nuclear proteins were prepared by the rapid method of Schreiber et al .
( 36 ) .
Briefly , 0.5-1 x 10° cells were rinsed twice in TBS ( Tris buffer saline ) at room temperature , harvested 15 s in a microcentrifuge , and lysed in 400 ul of buffer A ( 10 mm HEPES , pH 7.9 , 10 mM KCl , 0.1 mm EDTA , 0.1 mm EGTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) .
Following 15 min of incubation , 15 ul of a 10 % Nonidet P-40 solution were added at 4 °C and vigorously homogenized .
After 30 s of high speed centrifugation in the microcentrifuge , the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ul of cold buffer B ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7.9 , 0.4 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) .
After clarification using high speed centrifugation , aliquots were stored at -80 °C in buffer B. Gel Retardation Assays-The gel retardation assays were performed by a combination of the procedures of Halligan and Desiderio ( 37 ) and of Singh et al .
( 38 ) .
For the binding reaction , 0.2-0.5 ng of radiolabeled DNA fragment ( 10,000 cpm ) were mixed with 2-5 ug of nuclear extracts in a final volume of 30 pl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 25-100 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 15 % glycerol , and 1-5 ug of poly ( dI ) -poly ( dC ) used as nonspecific competitor .
Specific competitors were added to each reaction as described in the individual experiments .
Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed on 6 % polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 x TBE buffer ( 1 x TBE : 0.089 m Tris-HCl , 0.089 M boric acid , 0.002 M EDTA ) .
The gels were preelectrophoresed twice at 180 V for 1 h and electrophoresed at the same voltage for 2-3 h at +4 °C .
After electrophoresis , the gels were dried and autoradiographed overnight .
DNase I Protection Assays-The footprinting studies were performed essentially as described by Ohlsson and Edlund ( 39 ) .
In summary , 50 ug of nuclear extracts were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 2 ug of poly ( dI ) -poly ( dC ) in a final volume of 50 ul containing 25 mM HEPES , pH 7.8 , 50 mM KCI , 0.05 mm EDTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 5 % glycerol .
Two ng of 5 end-labeled DNA fragment ( 30,000 cpm ) were added , and incubation was allowed for 40 min at room temperature .
Three to four units of DNase I ( Promega Corp. ) were then added in the presence of 5 mM MgC ) ; , and digestion was allowed for 1 min on ice .
The enzyme was inactivated with 100 pl of a solution containing 100 gM Tris hydrochloride ( pH 7.8 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 10 mM EDTA , 100 ug of proteinase K/ml , and 25 ug of tRNA/ ml and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation .
The one-end-labeled DNA fragments were analyzed on denaturing 6-8 % polyacrylamide gels .
The gels were fixed , dried , and autoradiographed using an intensifying screen .
Cell Transfection and CAT Assays-The chloramphenicol acetyl- 8933 transferase ( CAT ) plasmid used was pBLCAT3 ( 40 ) , which contains the coding region of the bacterial CAT gene and the polyadenylation signal from SV40 .
The 1.08-kb Mbol/Mbol genomic segment was blunted and inserted to the Xba-I site of pBLCAT3 .
This construction was linearized with Sph-I and Sal-I and digested progressively with Exoll !
mung bean nuclease .
Three fragments were selected extending from +33 to -414 , -553 , and -643 , respectively .
These constructions were transfected into HEL and Raji cells by the electroporation method ( 41 ) and into HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate method ( 42 ) .
The pRSVCAT plasmid containing the CAT gene driven by the RSV promoter was used as a positive control .
Ten ug of pRSVL plasmid , containing the luciferase gene under the control of the RSV promoter ( 43 ) , were cotransfected with the IIb CAT constructs for internal control .
After each transfection , the luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer and expressed in arbitrary units .
To normalize the different experiments with the pBLIIb CAT construct , an amount protein extract corresponding to 20 luciferase units was used for the CAT assays .
Due to the high activity of the RSV promoter a lower amount of protein extract corresponding to 5 units of luciferase was used to normalize the CAT assays when the pRSVCAT plasmid was used in control experiment .
The correct initiation of the GPIIb CAT mRNA was verified as follows .
Three different oligonucleotides were synthesized and used in the polymerase chain reaction .
Oligo 1 corresponded to the nucleotide sequence +183 to +163 downstream from the GP IIb transcription start site ; oligo 2 contained the nucleotide sequence between +1 and +20 ; and oligo 3 corresponded to the sequence between nucleotides -1 and -20 ( Fig .
1C ) .
Total RNA ( 1 ug ) isolated from the cells , previously transfected with the IIb CAT plasmid , were treated with RQ1 DNase ( Promega ) and incubated with 100 pmol of oligo 1 and 100 pmol of oligo 2 or oligo 3 in the presence of RNasin , 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( Bethesda Research Laboratories ) , 2.5 units of Taq polymerase ( Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments ) in 50 mM KCI , 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8.3 , 1 mM 0.01 % gelatin in a final volume of 100 ul .
After 30 min of incubation at 37°C , the mixture was heated at 94 °C for 1.5 min and subjected to 20 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C , 1 min at 55 °C , and 1 min at 72°C in an automatic thermal cycler .
The amplified DNA was analyzed on 1.5 % agarose gels , transferred on Hybond membrane , and hybridized with a genomic probe .
The plasmid Ib CAT was used as a positive control .
RESULTS A 676-bp Fragment from the 5 Region of the GPIIb Gene Contains Sufficient Information for Cell-specific Expression-We have previously reported the isolation and the sequencing of the -flanking region and the determination of the transcription initiation start site of the human GPIIb gene ( 28 ) .
To verify if this region contains responsive elements essential for its expression in megakaryocytic cells , a 676-bp DNA fragment containing the region upstream from the ATG was tested for its capacity to stimulate the transcription of a heterologous gene .
The fragment was inserted upstream of the bacterial CAT gene in the vector pBLCAT3 to generate the plasmid pBLIIbCAT3 .
In preliminary experiments , we verified that the GPIIb CAT fusion mRNA was correctly initiated at the GP IIb gene initiation start site .
After transfection with the IIbCAT plasmid , the RNA were isolated and amplified with the PCR methodology using three different oligonucleotides .
Oligo 1 contained 20 nucleotides starting at position +183 of the CAT gene ( Fig .
1C ) .
Oligos 2 and 3 contained the 20 nucleotides on each side of the initiation start site of the IIb gene ( Fig .
1C ) .
The amplification reaction was performed with oligo 1 and oligo 2 or 3 .
When the IIb CAT plasmid was used as a control , two DNA fragments of 183 and 203 bp were generated , corresponding to the size of the expected fragments ( Fig .
1D ) .
When the mRNA of transfected cells was used , a single fragment of 183 bp was generated with oligos 1 and 2 ( Fig .
1D ) .
This indicated that the fusion mRNA was initiated at the correct transcription start site of the GPIIb gene .

Transcriptional activity of the upstream region of the human GPIIb gene in HEL , Raji , and HeLa cells .
A DNA fragment corresponding to the genomic sequence from position -643 to -33 was generated by Exolll digestion of a Mbol-Mbol 1080-bp fragment ( panel A ) and was analyzed in a CAT assay after transient transfection of different cell lines using pBLCAT3 vector ( panel B ) .
As a positive control ( panel B , lanes a to c ) , HeLa cells ( lane a ) , Raji cells ( lane b ) , and HEL cells ( lane c ) were transfected with pBLRSVCAT3 vector .
As described under `` Materials and Methods , '' the cells were cotransfected with the plasmid pRSVL .
The CAT assays were performed with a volume of protein extracts corresponding to 5 arbitrary units of luciferase activity .
In lanes d-f , the cells were transfected with IIbpBLCAT3 and PRSVL , and the volume of protein extract that was used for the CAT assay corresponded to 20 units of luciferase activity .
When the CAT activity obtained after transfection with the RSV promoter in Raji , HeLa , and HEL cells was taken as 100 % , the average CAT activity with GPIIb promoter was 0 % in Raji cells ( not detectable ) , 1.7 + 1.5 % in HeLa cells , and 15 + 2 % in HEL cells .
To verify if the initiation of the fusion GPIIb CAT transcript was correctly initiated , the transfected RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase using oligo 1 as primer ( panel C ) .
The PCR reaction was performed on the cDNA with oligo 2 or oligo 3 as second primer ( panel D , RNA , 1 + 2 and 1 + 3 , respectively ) .
A control experiment was done on IIbCAT plasmid with the same oligonucleotides ( panel D , IIbCAT plasmid , 1 + 2 and 1 + 3 ) .
regulatory signals , we compared the CAT activity of the transfected cells with that obtained with cells transfected in parallel with the plasmid pRSVCAT , containing the highly active and ubiquitous RSV promoter .
The vector pBLCAT3 , which does not contain any eukaryotic promoter region , was used in control experiments .
The different constructs were cotransfected in HEL , HeLa , and Raji cells , with the plasmid pRSVL containing the luciferase gene used as an internal reference to evaluate the transfection efficiency .
As indicated in Fig .
1B , the RSV promoter was efficient in the three cell lines .
In contrast , the vector pBLIIbCAT3 induced an efficient expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity only in HEL cells .
When the 676-bp fragment was inserted in the opposite direction , the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in HEL cells was abolished ( data not shown ) .
To evaluate the strength of the IIb promoter , the percentages of chloramphenicol conversion induced by the IIb promoter and the RSV promoter were compared in a homogeneous system , using the same transfection technique and the same cells .
The results were normalized with an internal control using the luciferase gene .
When the value obtained from the RSV promoter was taken as the 100 % value , an average of 15 + 2 % conversion was obtained for the IIb promoter in HEL cells ( Fig .
1 ) .

Different DNA fragments from the 5'-flanking sequence of the GPIIb gene were produced with the PCR pro-cedure .
The sequence of each was verified prior to 5¢ end-labeled and DNase I protection assays .
cluded that the 676-bp fragment contains sequences that are sufficient to confer transcription in a tissue-specific manner when tested in transient assays .
The Promoter Region of the GPIIb Gene Contains Multiple Binding Sites for Nuclear Factors-To map the binding sites of nuclear factors on the GPIIb gene 5'-flanking sequence , the region between nucleotides +93 and -598 was further analyzed by DNase I footprinting .
Different DNA fragments corresponding to this fragment were produced with the PCR technique ( Fig .
2 ) , each of which was 5 end-labeled for Expression of Platelet GPIIb Gene protection assays and cut with selected restriction enzymes to generate one strand-labeled fragment .
The DNA segment was analyzed for protection at both strands .
The protected areas illustrated in Figs .
3 and 4 were the same on both strands .
Fragment I , which contains 95 bp downstream from the initiation start site and includes part of exon I , did not show any protected area and was not further analyzed .
Fragment II , spanning the area between nucleotides -6 and -154 , showed one protected region , designated domain A , centered at -54 .
This domain contains a 20-bp core sequence that was specifically protected by nuclear factors prepared from HEL cells .
Fragment III , containing the region between nucleotides -152 and -428 , showed two different domains protected by both HEL and HeLa factors .
One footprint , centered at -230 ( domain B ) , corresponds to a 23-bp core sequence .
The other footprint , centered at -350 ( domain C ) , corresponds to a 24-bp protected area .
With fragment IV , spanning the region between nucleotides -357 and -548 , two footprinted areas were visible .
These two domains , D ( 19 bp ) and E ( 22 bp ) , were specifically protected from nucleolytic attack by factors from HEL cells .
Finally , fragment V , which contains the sequence between nucleotides -488 and -598 and overlaps fragment IV , showed two footprinted areas .
One of these two footprints corresponds to domain E , which again was specifically protected by HEL factors ; the other region , domain F ( 32 bp ) , was protected by both HEL and HeLa factors ( Fig .
4 ) .
The sequences corresponding to the protected areas are listed in Table I .
A comparison of these sequences with other known binding sites revealed a number of interesting features .
The presence of a 5'-GATAAGAA-3 ' motif within the protected sequence of domain A suggests that this domain may have a function similar to that of a GATA box present in regulatory regions of erythroid-specific genes that interacts -154 -6 -428 -152 C HEL Hela C HEL Hela 147 @ 19¢ ai E < 3¥56 a 180 B `` = L a |- # ~243 `` * we # ( - : 160 z a [ A 147 ® so & s 6s e 3 aw a+ 1 * § Z - 1 : @ B 67 & y we *-m ® 110 Q , & t f c .

TABLE I Homologies of the protected region of the GPIIb promoter with other promoter sequences The nucleotide sequences of the human GPIb ( hGPIb ) gene were obtained from Wenger et al .
( 47 ) ; sequences of the rat PF4 ( rPF4 ) gene are from Doi et al .
( 48 ) .
The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the mouse -globin ( m a-globin ) NF-E1 site and to the human a-globin ( h a-globin ) CAAT box are from Plumb et al .
( 35 ) and Chodosh et al .
( 32 ) , respectively .
The sequence of the human porphobilinogen deaminase gene ( hPBGD ) is from Mignotte et al .

This motif is also present within the promoter region of the GPIb and the PF4 genes , two other megakaryocyte-specific genes that have recently been cloned ( 47 , 48 ) .
Domain B contains the motif 5'-AAC-CAAT-3 ' , which resembles the consensus CAAT box ( 32 ) .
Domain C and domain D do not contain homology with known binding sites , whereas domain E contains an octamer , 5'-CCTAGAA-3 ' , also present within the 5 sequence of the GP Ib gene ( 47 ) .
Finally , domain F contains a 5 ( -GGCCGCCC- 8936 3 ' sequence which resembles an Spl-binding site associated with a motif also present in the regulatory region of the PF4 gene ( 48 ) .
Thus , from these results , we concluded that the 598-bp fragment contains multiple protected sites with a potential binding activity for ubiquitous and tissue-specific nuclear proteins .
To verify which individual protein might interact with the different protected domains , synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the protected sequences were analyzed in direct binding experiments using electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
Domain A Contains a Binding Site for a NF-E1-like Pro-tein-When an oligomer , containing the protected sequence of the region A , was incubated with nuclear extracts from HEL cells in the presence of a vast excess of the nonspecific competitor poly ( dI ) -poly ( dC ) , one major DNA-protein complex was formed ( Fig .
5 ) .
Incubation of the probe in the presence of an excess of the nonlabeled oligomer inhibited the formation of this complex , whereas a nonrelated oligonucleotide corresponding to the HNF1-binding site did not compete with the sequence of the domain A ( Fig .
5 , lane 3 ) .
Incubation of the oligo A with nuclear proteins from HeLa cells resulted in the formation of several retarded DNA-protein complexes ( Fig .
5 ) .
But the formation of these complexes was inhibited by an excess of the nonlabeled oligomer containing the HNF1-binding site , indicating that they were due to nonspecific interactions .
Since domain A contains a GATAA motif that functions as an NF-E1-binding site , an oligonucleotide corresponding to the GATA box present in the promoter region of the murine « -globin gene was synthesized and used as a competitor .
As shown in Fig .
5 ( lane 4 ) , incubation in the presence of an excess of this NF-E1 oligomer completely abolished the DNA-protein complex formation with the oligo A .
These results indicated that domain A may potentially interact with an NF-E1-like protein present in HEL cells .
Domain B Contains a CAAT-binding Site-From the protected sequence of footprint B , the presence of a CAAT element was suggested .
To verify this possibility , an oligonucleotide corresponding to this sequence was synthesized and its binding activity was compared with that of an oligonucleotide derived from the CAAT -binding site of the human « -globin gene .
Both oligos gave rise to one DNA-protein com HEL Hela 1.2 3 4 5 6 U U `` it _ Fig .

Proteins binding to an oligonucleotide corresponding to footprint A .
A synthetic oligonucleotide carrying the protected DNA sequence of domain A was end-labeled and incubated with nuclear proteins of HEL cells ( lanes 1-4 ) or HeLa cells ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
The binding reaction was performed with 0.2-0.5 ug of labeled oligonucleotide and 5 ug of poly ( dI ) - poly ( dC ) , in the absence of DNA competitor ( lanes 1 and 5 ) , in the presence of 50 ng of cold oligo H , in the presence of 50 ng of an oligo carrying the HNF1-binding site ( lanes 3 and 6 ) , or of an oligo corresponding to the NFE2-binding site from mouse « -globin promoter ( lane 4 ) .
The samples were incubated for 40 min at room temperature and analyzed on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel .
Expression of Platelet GPIIb Gene plex of identical electrophoretic mobility with nuclear proteins from HEL and HeLa cells ( Fig .
6 ) .
The protein interacting with the globin CAAT element was present in both cells and was competed with a similar efficiency by the nonlabeled GP IIb and globin CAAT oligomers ( Fig .
6B , lanes 2 and 3 ) , whereas the oligo carrying the nonrelated HNF1-binding site had no effect with nuclear extracts from HeLa cells ( Fig .
6B , lane 4 ) .
With nuclear extracts from HEL cells , competition with the -globin CAAT or IIb CAAT sequences were similar .
Competition of the -globin CAAT oligomer with itself was slightly less efficient than with IIb CAAT oligomer when nuclear extract from HeLa cells were used .
The reason for this discrepancy is unknown .
The two oligomers do not have exactly the same core sequence , however .
Though the CAAT-binding proteins from HeLa and HEL cells exhibit the same molecular weight , they may differ slightly in their affinity for the two sequences .
This would be consistent with the existence of a family of CAAT -binding proteins present in different cells ( 32 ) .
Proteins Binding to Domains C and F-The footprint C was observed with nuclear extracts from HEL and HeLa cells .
A 30-bp fragment carrying the protected sequence was synthesized and analyzed for protein binding .
As shown in Fig .
7A , a similar retardation pattern was observed with proteins from HEL and HeLa cells .
Two major DNA-protein complexes were formed .

Protein binding to synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the protected domains C and F. Panel A , end-labeled oligo C was incubated with extracts from HEL or HeLa cells and analyzed using the procedure described in the legend to Fig .
5 .
The binding reactions were performed in the absence of DNA competitor ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of a 100-fold excess of nonlabeled oligo C ( lane 2 ) or HNF1-binding site ( lane 3 ) .
Panel B , end-labeled oligo F was incubated with proteins from HEL and HeLa cells and analyzed in the absence of competitor ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of a large excess of cold oligo F ( lane 2 ) or HNF1-binding site ( lane 3 ) .
Expression of Platelet GPIIb Gene of nonlabeled oligo C , but the oligo carrying the sequence of the HNF1-binding site inhibited the formation of the high molecular weight complex only ( Fig .
7A , lane 3 ) .
These results indicated that the domain corresponding to footprint C can form one specific complex with the ubiquitous protein present in HEL and HeLa cells .
Similar results were obtained with synthetic oligonucleotides carrying the DNA sequence of the protected domain F ( Fig .
7B ) .
Several retarded complexes were formed with proteins from HEL and HeLa cells with oligo F. In the presence of a large excess of the nonrelated HNF1-binding site , however , only one complex was observed ( Fig .
7B , lane 3 ) .
Domains D and E Interact with Megakaryocyte-specific Fac-tors-The sequences corresponding to domains D and E were specifically protected when nuclear extracts isolated from HEL cells were used , suggesting the formation of tissue-specific DNA-protein complexes .
To confirm this observation , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the protected sequences D and E. When the oligo D was incubated with HEL cell factors , only one complex was formed ( Fig .
8 ) .
Formation of this retarded complex was inhibited by an excess of cold oligo D but not by the oligonucleotide containing the HNF1-binding site .
A similar DNA-protein complex was observed with nuclear proteins prepared from purified megakaryocytes with the same inhibition pattern ( Fig .
8 ) .
Incubation of oligo D with factors from nonmegakaryocytic cells resulted in the formation of several DNA-protein complexes .
Formation of these complexes was , however , inhibited by both cold oligo D and the oligo carrying the HNF1-binding site , indicating that these complexes were due to nonspecific interactions .
When similar experiments were performed with oligo E , two complexes were formed with proteins from HEL cells ( Fig .
9 ) .
The formation of these complexes was inhibited by cold oligo E but not by the HNF1-binding site .
Since the sequence corresponding to the domain E contains a TAGA motif that is repeated twice in the domain C , competition with cold oligo C was also performed .
As shown in Fig .
9 ( lane 4 ) , the oligo C had no effect on the formation of the two complexes , thus indicating that the two complexes were interacting specifically with domain E and that the TAGA motif is not involved in these interactions .
The two retarded bands were also observed with nuclear proteins prepared from purified megakaryocytes ( Fig .
9 , lane 5 ) .

The fragments extending from +33 to -414 , -553 , and -643 , respectively , were subcloned in the pBLCAT3 vector and analyzed in CAT assays after transient transfection of HEL cells .
Protein-binding regions D and E are represented by solid boxes .
The arrow identifies the transcription start site .
The percentages of CAT conversion corresponding to each fragment are indicated ; when the CAT activity corresponding to the fragment extending to -643 was taken as 100 % , an average of 109 + 21 and 32 + 9 % of CAT conversion was found with fragments extending from -553 to +33 and from -414 to +33 , respectively .
32 + 9 in the formation of only one retarded electrophoretic band , corresponding to the complex of higher molecular weight .
A 2-fold increase of the concentration of nuclear proteins from HeLa cells did not modify this pattern .
In competition experiments , this retarded complex of high molecular weight was similarly inhibited by cold oligo E but not by the HNF1-binding site , thus indicating that the protein present in the different nuclear extracts was interacting specifically with the oligo E. These results are consistent with the protection assays and demonstrate that the sequences corresponding to domains D and E interact with nuclear factors that are present only in megakaryocytes or in megakaryocytic cells .
Domains D and E Are Necessary for Tissue-specific Expres-sion-To verify if the area containing domains D and E , which interact with megakaryocyte factors , had any functional activity , an analysis was performed .
Two different deletion mutants were constructed and examined in transient CAT assays using the pBLCAT3 vector as described above .
The first mutant contained the region from nucleotide +33 to -553 , including the D-E cluster .
The second deletion mutant contained the sequence from nucleotide +33 to -414 and did not include the D-E cluster .
As shown in Fig .
10 , the deletion of the cluster reduced the activity of the promoter by 60 % when the mutants were transfected in HEL cells .
These results indicated that the D-E cluster is implicated in the tissue-specific activity of the GP IIb promoter .
8938 DISCUSSION Tissue-specific gene expression is controlled by a combination of ubiquitous trans-acting factors interacting with cis-acting elements within the promoter region , associated or not with a limited number of cell-specific nuclear proteins ( 49 ) .
The exact mechanisms by which these cis-acting complexes regulate transcription in a tissue-specific manner are not yet understood .
Identification of these factors and the mechanisms that control their transcriptional activities is nevertheless a critical step toward our understanding of the processes that regulate cell differentiation .
A number of hematopoietic genes , including erythroid and granulocytic genes , have recently been examined and used to search for lineage-specific trans-acting proteins within the hematopoietic system .
In the present study , we have analyzed the promoter region of the platelet GPIIb gene , which is expressed in megakaryocytes and represents a specific and early marker for this lineage .
The results show that the 5'-flanking region of this gene contains positive responsive elements that are sufficient to direct a high level of specific expression in megakaryocytic cells .
This information is contained within the first 600 bases upstream from the initiation start site .
A DNA fragment containing this region was able to direct the expression of a reporter gene , in a tissue-specific manner .
Footprinting studies and binding analysis of this 600-bp domain have shown that it contains two separate areas that display significant interactions with nuclear proteins .
The domain from nucleotides -1 to -250 contains a CAAT motif located at position -233 .
This motif matches in DNA sequence 5-AACCAAT-3 ' with CAAT sites from many eukar-yote promoters .
The region is protected by nuclear proteins , and the protected sequence forms a DNA-protein complex similar to that observed with a consensus CAAT -binding site derived from the « -globin gene .
In addition , the GP IIb CAAT sequence competes with the « -globin CAAT -binding site and is located on the coding strand pointing toward the initiation start site in a usual orientation .
Thus , there is ample evidence to suggest that this protected sequence contains the CAAT-binding site of the GP IIb promoter .
The location of this motif at position -233 is , however , unusual .
Additional functional assays will be necessary to establish the activity of this site .
The presence of two inverted repeats in this area may , however , induce a specific looping of the DNA structure , which would bring the CAAT-binding site closer to the initiation start site .
Located at position -54 , the GP IIb promoter contains a 5 GATAAG-3 ' motif .
This sequence has been shown to be the binding site for the erythroid factor NF-E1 ( 85 , 44-46 ) .
In addition to the GP IIb gene , two other megakaryocyte-specific genes have been cloned , i.e .
the genes encoding GP Ib and PF4 ( 47-48 ) , both of which contain such a GATA box .
In the present study , we confirm that this site may function as a binding site for the NF-E1-trans-acting factor or for a protein of the same family .
Using site-directed mutagenesis , we have shown in a separate study ( 50 ) that this site is functional .
These results are in agreement with the observations from Martin et al .
( 51 ) who have recently cloned NF-E1 and shown that this factor is also expressed in megakaryocytes .
This suggests that megakaryocyte-specific promoters may share common regulatory elements with erythroid genes .
The presence of this site within the promoter region of the GPIIb gene is , however , not sufficient to direct an efficient tissue-specific expression of the gene .
The 5 region contains a second domain with binding sites for nuclear proteins , located between nucleotides -330 and -550 , Two binding sites centered at positions -345 and -540 , Expression of Platelet GPIIb Gene domain C and F , display specific interactions with proteins that are present in megakaryocytic cells and unrelated cells as well .
A comparison of the sequence corresponding to these domains did not reveal any homologies with known sequences , except for the presence of a hexamer within the domain F , with the sequence 5-TGGCTG-3 ' that was found within the promoter region of the PF4 gene ( 48 ) .
Thus , we anticipate that these ubiquitous factors are either inactive or necessary to maintain a tissue-specific DNA-protein complex .
Further studies on the transcriptional activity of these factors are required to support this latter hypothesis .
Two other sites interact with factors that are only present in megakaryocytes or megakaryocytic cell lines .
A binding site centered at position -460 ( domain D ) formed a single specific DNA-protein complex .
The sequence of this domain is A- and T-rich and has no homology with any other sequences from megakaryocytic genes or eukaryotic genes in general .
Finally , the domain E contains an octamer with the motif 5-CCTAGAAG-3 ' , which is also present in the 5 region of the GPIb gene .
This binding site is located at position -10 and interacts with another factor only present in megakaryocytic cells .
These two domains form a cluster of about 80 bp , which seems to be necessary to confer an efficient transcriptional activity of the GPIIb promoter .
Deletion of this cluster resulted in a 60 % decrease of the activity of the promoter .
Thus , this region may function as a megakaryocyte-specific enhancer .
In summary , the major conclusion of this study is that the GPIIb promoter region contains sufficient information to direct a tissue-specific expression of the gene and binding sites for megakaryocyte-specific nuclear proteins .
Functional and structural characterization of these proteins will constitute the next step to verify whether they represent candidate molecules to study the early expression of megakaryocytic genes .
Further studies are in progress to better define the functions of the different GPIIb regulatory regions and to verify if they could be used to target the expression of heterologous genes in the megakaryocyte in vivo .
