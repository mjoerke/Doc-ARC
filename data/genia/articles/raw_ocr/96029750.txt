11 Attenuation of Gamma Interferon-Induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Mononuclear Phagocytes Infected with Leishmania donovani : Selective Inhibition of Signaling through Janus Kinases and Statl DEVKI NANDAN aAnp NEIL E. REINER*** Department of Medicine ( Division of Infectious Diseases ) '' and Department of Microbiology and Immunology , '' The University of British Columbia Faculties of Medicine and Science and The Research Institute of the Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Center , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada Received 28 June 1995/Returned for modification 15 August 1995/Accepted 31 August 1995 The induction of gene transcription in response to gamma interferon is impaired in mononuclear phagocytes infected with Leishmania donovani , and the mechanisms involved are not fully understood .
The changes in gene expression brought about by gamma interferon are thought to involve transient increases in the activities of cellular protein tyrosine kinases , including the Janus kinases Jakl and Jak2 , leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor Stat1 .
To investigate the mechanisms accounting for the impaired responses to gamma interferon , a model system for examining overall changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation , activation of Jak1 and Jak2 , and phosphorylation of Statl was developed in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated U-937 cells .
Analysis of whole-cell lysates by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting showed that incubation with gamma interferon brought about specific increases in phosphotyrosine labeling of several proteins .
Increased labeling of these proteins occurred to similar extents in control cells and in cells that had been infected with L. donovani for 16 h. Jakl , Jak2 , and Statl were immunoprecipitated from control and interferon-treated cells , and tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins , detected by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting , was used to measure their activation .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Statl increased markedly , in a dose-dependent manner , in U-937 cells incubated with gamma interferon .
In contrast , in cells infected with L. donovani , tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Statl was markedly impaired .
This effect was dependent upon the duration of exposure to L. donovani and was maximal and complete at 16 h. Results similar to those observed with U-937 cells were also obtained with human peripheral blood monocytes .
These findings indicate that infection of human mononuclear phagocytes with L. donovani leads to impaired gamma interferon-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and selective effects on the Jak-Stat1 pathway .
Unresponsiveness to gamma interferon for activation of this pathway may explain impaired transcriptional responses in leishmania-infected cells .
Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are obligate intracellular parasites of monocytes and macrophages that cause substantial human morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world .
An important question in mononuclear phagocyte cell biology and immunology is how leishmanias and other intracellular pathogens have adapted to resist the antimicrobial properties of these cells .
Mononuclear phagocytes must be activated to kill intracellular microbes , and while a broad range of agonists are able to bring about various degrees of cell activation , gamma interferon is the most thoroughly characterized agent with respect to the induction of microbial killing ( 2 , 3 , 10 , 11 ) .
Infection of mononuclear phagocytes with leishmanias and other intracellular pathogens has been shown to result in impaired cellular responsiveness to gamma interferon , and this state of cell deactivation may contribute to microbial persistence ( 7 , 16 ; for a review , see reference 14 ) .
While the exact basis for this deactivated state remains to be fully explored and is likely to be multifactorial , mononuclear phagocytes infected * Corresponding author .

4495 with Leishmania donovani and Leishmania braziliensis have been shown to produce such autoinhibitory factors as prostan-oids ( 15 ) and transforming growth factor B ( 1 ) that attenuate cellular responses to gamma interferon .
In addition , macrophages infected with L. donovani have also been shown to have defects in stimulus-response coupling , leading to impaired functional responses ( reviewed in reference 14 ) .
It has recently become clear that intracellular signaling in response to gamma interferon involves two cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that are members of the Janus ( or Jak ) family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases ( 5 , 17 ) .
Treatment of cells with gamma interferon results in the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak1 and Jak2 .
Activated Jaks are believed to catalyze the phosphorylation on tyrosine of a 91,000-M , DNA-binding protein known as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 ( Statl ) .
Phosphorylated Stat1 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus , where it binds to the gamma interferon activation sequence in gamma interferon-inducible genes , leading to activation of gene transcription .
To examine further the basis for unresponsiveness of leishmania-infected macrophages to gamma interferon , the activation of Jak1 and Jak2 leading to the phosphorylation of Stat1 was studied .
The results show that gamma interferon-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was attenuated and that Jak1 and Jak2 activation and phosphorylation of Statl were selectively impaired in both 4496 NANDAN AND REINER differentiated U-937 cells and human monocytes infected with Leishmania donovani .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents and chemicals .
RPMI 1640 and Hanks ' balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) were obtained from the Terry Fox Laboratory of the British Columbia Cancer Agency of Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada .
Phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate ( PMA ) and protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , pepstatin A , aprotinin , and leupeptin were from Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , Mo .
Microcystin-LR was from Calbiochem , San Diego , Calif. Human AB+ serum was obtained from the Canadian Red Cross , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada .
Affinity-purified antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Jak1 and Jak2 were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. , Lake Placid , N.Y. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Stat1 were kindly provided by Andrew Larner , The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research , Food and Drug Administration , Bethesda , Md .
Recombinant human gamma interferon was a generous gift of Genentech Inc. , South San Francisco , Calif. L. donovani .
Amastigotes of the Sudan strain 28 of L. donovani were maintained by serial intracardiac inoculation of the amastigotes into female Syrian hamsters .
The amastigotes were isolated from the spleens of hamsters infected 4 to 6 weeks earlier as previously described ( 12 ) .
Culture and differentiation of U-937 cells .
The promonocytic cell line U-937 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( CRL 1593 ) and cultured in suspension in stationary , 75-em* cell culture flasks in RPMI 1640 supplemented with low endotoxin , 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum ( Hy-Clone , Logan , Utah ) , and antibiotics as described for human monocytes ( see below ) .
Prior to infection with L. donovani U-937 cells were cultured for 18 h in the presence of PMA ( 10 ng/m ! ) .
This treatment rendered the cells adherent and capable of phagocytosis of amastigotes .
Isolation and culture of human monocytes .
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated as described previously ( 9 ) and were suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) human AB+ serum , penicillin ( 100 U/ml ) , and streptomycin ( 100 pg/ml ) .
The cells were seeded into 150-cm > * cell culture flasks at a density of 1.5 X 10° cells per flask .
Monocytes were allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO , -95 % air .
Nonadherent cells were removed by three vigorous washings with divalent cation-free HBSS .
Adherent monolayers were replenished with supplemented RPMI 1640 without serum and were allowed to equilibrate for 1 to 3 h before infection .
Infection of U-937 cells and human monocytes .
Differentiated U-937 cells ( 5 X 10° cells per 75-cm* cell culture flask ) were infected with freshly isolated amastigotes of L. donovani ( 10° parasites per flask ) .
After the desired period of incubation at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO , -95 % air , noningested amastigotes were removed by washing with HBSS .
To determine the rate of infection , cytospin preparations were prepared from dislodged cells , which were stained with Diff-Quik .
For the infection of monocytes , monolayers were infected with amastigotes at a parasite-to-monocyte ratio of approximately 20:1 .
The rate of infection in monocytes was monitored as described for U-937 cells .
Cell incubation , immunoprecipitation , and Western blotting ( immunoblot-ting ) .
Prior to treatment with gamma interferon , the cells were preincubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 for at least 1 h at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO , -95 % air .
The cells were then treated with cither medium alone or the desired concentration of gamma interferon .
After cell treatment , monolayers were washed twice with HBSS and immediately processed for immunoprecipitation .
For immunoprecipitation of Jak1 and Jak2 , the cells were lysed on ice in modified RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris [ pH 7.5 ] , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.25 % sodium deoxycholate , 0.15 M NaCl , 1 mM EGTA [ ethylene glycol-bis ( B-aminoethyl ether ) -N , N , N ' , V'-tet-raacetic acid ] , 1 mM NaF , 1 mM orthovanadate , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 100 mM microcystin , 10 pg of aprotinin per ml , 10 pg of leupeptin per ml , and 2 g of pepstatin A per ml ) .
For immunoprecipitation of Stat1l , the cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer without sodium deoxycholate .
Lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4°C .
The resulting supernatants were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes and incubated ( for 16 to 18 h at 4°C ) with a 1:250 dilution of antibodies specific for Jak1 , Jak2 , or Stat ] or with normal rabbit serum .
After incubation with antibodies , protein A-agarose was added for 2 h at 4°C for recovery of immune complexes .
The protein A conjugates were washed four times with appropriate lysis buffer .
Immune complexes were released by boiling agarose beads in sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer ( 8 ) .
Samples were analyzed by SDS-7.5 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and this was followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes .
The unused sites on the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 3 % bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 ( TBS-T ) ( 20 mM Tris [ pH 7.6 ] and 0.137 M NaCl with 0.1 % Tween 20 ) for 12 to 16 h at 4°C .
The blots were then incubated for 2 h with a 10,000-fold dilution of antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 at room temperature .
After they were washed in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 , the blots were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase conjugates of secondary antibody ( Amersham ) and washed again as described above .
The immunoblots were processed further by incubating the membranes with enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) substrate , and the immunoblots were developed on ECL hyperfilm ( Amersham ) .

After they were extensively washed and blocked , the membranes were probed with anti-Jak1 , anti-Jak2 , or anti-Stat1 .
The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugates of goat anti-rabbit ( Bio-Rad ) immunoglobulin G , and the blots were developed on ECL hyperfilm by ECL .
RESULTS Gamma interferon induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1 in U-937 cells .
To examine the Jak-Statl signaling pathway in gamma interferon-treated cells , exponentially growing , undifferentiated U-937 cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C with either medium alone or gamma interferon ( 100 U/ml ) .
The cells were then washed once with HBSS and lysed in detergent containing RIPA lysis buffer as described in Materials and Methods .
Immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for Jak1 and Jak2 followed by immunoblot analysis with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies showed that gamma interferon induced substantial tyrosine phosphorylation of both Jaks ( Fig .
1A ) .
It should also be noted that a second protein with an M , .
of approximately 120,000 that appeared to be constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine was consistently coim-munoprecipitated from U-937 cells with Jak2 ( Fig .
1A and B ) .
The identity of this constitutively phosphorylated protein is unknown , but as will be seen below , it was not detected in human monocytes .
Activation of Jak1 and Jak2 in gamma interferon-treated U-937 cells suggested that this would likely be accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of DNA-binding protein Statl .
Immunoprecipitation with anti-Statl followed by antiphosphotyrosine Western blotting demonstrated that a marked increase in the phosphorylation of a protein with an expected M , of 91,000 took place ( Fig .
1A , lane 8 ) .
To examine the gamma interferon dose-response relationship for tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2 , U-937 cells were incubated for 10 min with a range of concentrations of Vou .

Effect of leishmania infection on gamma interferon-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in U-937 cells .
Differentiated U-937 cells were either left untreated or incubated with leishmania amastigotes at an approximate parasite-to-cell ratio of 20:1 .
After overnight incubation ( 16 h ) , control ( lanes 1 and 3 ) and infected ( lanes 2 and 4 ) cells were incubated in the absence ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or presence ( lanes 3 and 4 ) of 100 U of gamma interferon per ml for 10 min at 37°C .
Cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer , electrophoresed , and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane .
The membrane was probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and developed by ECL .

The results shown in Fig .
1B demonstrate that phosphorylation of both Jak1 and Jak2 was detectable at 10 U of gamma interferon per ml and was maximal at a concentration of 100 U/ml .
Effect of leishmania infection on gamma interferon-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in U-937 cells .
Incubation of exponentially growing U-937 cells with Leishmania amastigotes resulted in infection of only 10 to 20 % of the cells .
In contrast , when U-937 cells were allowed to differentiate in the presence of PMA ( 10 ng/ml ) for 24 h , the cells became adherent , and upon incubation with Leishmania amastigotes , infection rates of > 90 % were achieved .
In initial studies , responses of phorbol ester-differentiated U-937 cells to gamma interferon with respect to the activation of Jak1 and Jak2 and tyrosine phosphorylation of Statl were observed to be indistinguishable from those observed in nondifferentiated cells .
Differentiated U-937 cells were , therefore , considered to be a suitable model system in which to examine the effects of infection with L. donovani , and these cells were used in all studies concerned with leishmania infection .
Differentiated U-937 cells , infected and noninfected , were either left untreated or incubated with gamma interferon ( 100 U/ml ! )
for 10 min at 37°C , and this was followed by lysis in SDS sample buffer .
Lysates were analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine Western blotting .
Basal ( in non-interferon-treated cells ) patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were different for control and leishmania-infected cells ( Fig .
2 ; compare lanes 1 and 2 ) .
For example , a prominent band with an M , .
of approximately 200,000 was present with infected cells but not with control cells .
In order to ascertain to what extent amastigote-derived proteins may have contributed to the differences ob-served , the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in an amastigote lysate was examined in parallel .
As can be seen in Fig .
2 ( lane 6 ) , a prominent protein band with an M , of 200,000 was also observed with the amastigote preparation .
This suggested that the corresponding band in infected cells was likely leishmania derived and not an induced host cell protein .

Leishmania infection attenuates gamma interferon-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1 in U-937 cells .
Differentiated U-937 cells were incubated with amastigotes of L. donovani at an approximate parasite-to-cell ratio of 20:1 .
Parallel flasks were incubated with fixed S. aureus ( 0.002 % ) .
After overnight incubation ( 16 h ) , control and infected cells were washed with HBBS and incubated with gamma interferon ( 100 U/m ! )
for 10 min at 37°C .
Cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with the antibodies indicated .
Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies , and developed by ECL .
( A ) Anti-Jak1 ( lanes 1 to 4 ) , anti-Jak2 ( lanes 5 to 8 ) , and anti-Stat1 ( lanes 9 to 12 ) .

Lanes 2 , 6 , and 10 represent uninfected cells incubated with gamma interferon .

interest was that some leishmania-derived phosphotyrosine-containing proteins-for example , the prominent doublet with Ms of approximately 76,000 and 72,000-actually appeared to be diminished in intensity in infected cells .
Treatment of noninfected control cells with gamma interferon brought about increased tyrosine phosphorylation of at least three proteins with Ms of approximately 125,000 , 60,000 , and 52,000 ( Fig .
2 ; compare lanes 1 and 3 ) .
Increased labeling of these proteins also occurred to a comparable extent in leishmania-infected cells ( Fig .
2 ; compare lanes 2 and 4 ) .
These results indicate that leishmania infection does not globally inhibit gamma interferon-induced changes in tyrosine phosphorylation in U-937 cells .
Gamma interferon-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Statl is attenuated in leishmania-infected U-937 cells .
Differentiated U-937 cells , infected ( for 16 to 18 h ) and noninfected , were incubated with gamma interferon and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Statl ( Fig .
3 ) .
As can be seen in Fig .
3 , gamma interferon-induced phosphorylation of Jak1 ( panel A , lanes 1 to 4 ) , Jak2 ( panel A , lanes 5 to 8 ) , and Stat1 ( panel A , lanes 9 to 12 ) appeared to be abrogated in Leishmania-infected cells .
To control for the non-specific effects of phagocytosis , an additional group of U-937 cells was allowed to ingest fixed Staphylococcus aureus .
As can be seen in Fig .
3 ( panel A , lanes 4 , 8 , and 12 ) , these cells were fully responsive to gamma interferon .
The simplest explanation for decreased signal intensity in samples from Leishmania -infected cells in the 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots in Fig .
3A is impaired gamma interferon-induced signaling .
This would result in the diminished activation of Jak1 and Jak2 , in the decreased autophosphorylation of these kinases , as well as in the diminished phosphorylation of Statl .
Alternatively , these results could also be explained if infection had in some manner led to reduced levels of expression of these three proteins .
As can be seen in Fig .
3B , however , the latter possibility was eliminated when the membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies specific for Jak1 , Jak2 , and Statl .

Attenuation of Jak-Stat signaling during leishmania infection is time dependent .
To examine whether the effects of leishmania infection were time dependent , cells were incubated with amastigotes for various periods of time .
The incu-bations were then terminated by lysis in RIPA buffer , and the cells were processed for immunoprecipitation and immunob-lotting .
As can be seen in Fig .
4 , gamma interferon-induced activation of the Jak-Stat pathway occurred normally through 7 h of infection ( 80 % of the cells were infected with 7.9 + 4.4 [ mean + standard deviation ] amastigotes per cell ) .
In contrast , by 16 h ( 90 % of the cells infected with 15 + 8 amastigotes per cell ) , there was no evidence for activation of the Jak-Stat pathway .
Leishmania infection attenuates interferon-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1l , Jak2 , and Statl in human monocytes .
The results presented above indicate that infection of differentiated U-937 cells with L. donovani induces a state of unresponsiveness to gamma interferon-mediated signaling through Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1 .
To validate differentiated U-937 cells as a model system in which to study this interaction further , the effects of L. donovani infection on gamma interferon signaling were also examined in primary human peripheral blood monocytes .
Monocyte monolayers were incubated with freshly isolated amastigotes of L. donovani at a parasite to-cell ratio of approximately 20:1 .
This resulted in an infection rate of > 95 % at approximately 9.1 + 5.3 ( mean + standard deviation ) amastigotes per cell .
After 16 to 18 h of incubation , infected and control cells were incubated with gamma interferon for 10 min .

The results shown in Fig .
5 demonstrate that-as was the case with differentiated U-937 cells-leishmania infection induces a state of unresponsiveness to gamma interferon for the activation of Jak1 and Jak2 and for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Statl .
DISCUSSION Mononuclear phagocytes infected with L. donovani have impaired responses to gamma interferon for the induction of gene transcription ( 7 , 14 , 16 ) .
The aim of the present study was to investigate the possibility that this state of diminished responsiveness may be related to defective gamma interferon-mediated cell signaling .
Agonist-mediated changes in the activities of both receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are known to play central roles in the regulation of cell function ( 5 , 17 , 18 ) .
In this respect , a direct pathway leading from the gamma interferon receptor to activation of gene transcription is now known to involve two members of the Janus family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases , Jak1 and Jak2 , and in addition , the latent cytoplasmic DNA-binding protein Stat1 ( 5 , 17 ) .
Activation of Jak kinases involves their autophosphorylation on tyrosine , and Jak1 and Jak2 appear to be involved in bringing about tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 ( 5 ) .
Tyrosine-phosphorylated Statl dimerizes through SH2 domain interactions and translocates to the nucleus , where it binds to a specific DNA consensus sequence , referred to as the gamma interferon activation sequence , present within promoter regions of certain gamma interferon-inducible genes ( 5 ) .
Thus , regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation at the whole-cell level and specifically the Jak-Stat signaling pathway are logical targets upon which to focus an investigation of impaired responses to gamma interferon during leishmania infection .
In initial experiments , it was observed that treatment of undifferentiated U-937 cells with gamma interferon resulted in rapid increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Statl ( Fig .
1A ) , and this was found to be concentration dependent for gamma interferon ( Fig .
1B ) .
However , because these cells ingested L. donovani only to a limited extent , it was necessary to differentiate them with PMA , after which they became adherent and were readily infected with L. donovani .
The Jak-Stat pathway was also observed to be rapidly activated in PMA-differentiated U-937 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Overall , the responses observed in differentiated U-937 cells were indistinguishable from those observed in non-PMA-treated cells .
Taken together , these findings indicate that differentiated Vou .
63 , 1995 U-937 cells are a suitable model system in which to examine the effects of L. donovani on gamma interferon-regulated changes in tyrosine phosphorylation at the whole-cell level as well as on the more specific activation of Jak1 and Jak2 leading to the phosphorylation of Statl .
It should be noted that a constitutive phosphotyrosine-containing protein with a slightly lower molecular mass than that of Jak2 was consistently coim-munoprecipitated with Jak2 in U-937 cells ( Fig .
2 to 4 ) .
The identity of this protein is not known , but it may not be unique to this system .
Recently , a constitutively phosphotyrosine-containing protein with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of Jak2 was also observed to be present in Jak2 immunoprecipitates from HeLa cells ( 4 ) .
The overall basal patterns of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in whole-cell lysates were different for noninfected and infected U-937 cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
For example , a prominent band with an M , of approximately 200,000 was present in infected cells but not in control cells .
A phosphotyrosine-containing protein with an M , of 200,000 was also relatively abundant in 4G10 immunoblots of amastigote lysates , indicating that the corresponding band in infected cells was likely leishmania derived and not an induced host cell protein .
In contrast , two other prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins that were also observed in amastigotes and that had M , of approximately 72,000 and 76,000 were significantly diminished in intensity in infected cells .
These results indicate that leishmania-derived phosphotyrosine-containing proteins are differentially expressed in infected macrophages .
There are several possible explanations for this finding .
First , this could be explained by the differential synthesis or stabilities of these amastigote proteins within U-937 cells .
Alternatively , the activities of leishmania tyrosine kinases , phosphotyrosine phosphatases or both towards these proteins may be differentially regulated in amastigotes and in infected cells .
Third , it is also possible that a host cell phosphatase may have greater activity toward the 72,000- and 76,000-M , leishmania proteins compared with that toward the 200,000-M , phosphotyrosine-containing protein .
Further work will be required to identify these leishmania phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and to define their potential roles in disease pathogenesis .
Analysis of the patterns of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in U-937 whole-cell lysates indicated that at least three proteins with M , s of approximately 125,000 , 60,000 , and 52,000 ( Fig .
2 ) showed increased phosphotyrosine content after incubation with gamma interferon .
Notably , increased labeling of these proteins occurred to similar extents in control and leishmania-infected cells .
The finding that gamma interferon-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is not globally inhibited in leishmania-infected cells indicates ( i ) that the gamma interferon receptor is functionally intact under these conditions , which is consistent with previously published findings ( 16 ) , and ( ii ) that at least one gamma interferon-regulated signaling pathway leading to changes in phosphotyrosine labeling appears to be unimpaired in these cells .
In contrast , more specific analysis of the gamma interferon responsiveness of Jak-Stat signaling components indicated that this pathway is selectively impaired in leishmania-infected cells ( Fig .
3 to 5 ) .
Attenuation of Jak-Stat signaling under these conditions appeared to be relatively specific for L. donovani , since activation of Jak1 and Jak2 and phosphorylation of Stat1 occurred normally in U-937 cells that had ingested fixed S. aureus .
The effects of leishmania infection were observed to be time dependent in that signaling through Jak-Stat appeared to be intact through 7 h of infection but was virtually nonexistent by 16 h ( Fig .
4 ) .
The intensity of infection of U-937 cells at 16 h was approximately twice that observed at 7 h. Thus , the de- LEISHMANIA DONOVANI AND Jak-Statl SIGNALING 4499 layed effect of L. donovani on the Jak-Stat pathway may reflect dependency on the level of infection , a requirement for synthesis of an inhibitor , or both .
Ongoing experiments are examining these possibilities .
The exact basis for the attenuation of gamma interferon-induced activation of the Jak-Stat signaling pathway in leishmania-infected cells remains to be defined .
However , a number of potential mechanisms may be considered .
For example , enhanced production of such autoinhibitory molecules as interleukin 10 , transforming growth factor B , or prostaglandins by infected cells could be involved .
Results of initial experiments , however , showing no effects of either transforming growth factor B or interleukin 10 on gamma interferon-induced activation of the Jak-Stat pathway in U-937 cells suggest that these molecules may not be relevant ( 10a ) .
Consistent with this observation , the responsiveness of the Jak-Stat pathway to gamma interferon in astrocytes was also observed to be unaffected by transforming growth factor B ( 13 ) .
Activation of Jak-Stat signaling by specific ligands is believed to involve receptor dimerization or oligomerization as well as binding of Jaks to receptor membrane proximal domains ( 5 ) .
While it is possible that these interactions could be disrupted by leishmania infection , leading to impaired signaling , it seems unlikely that such mechanisms would have delayed kinetics .
An alternative mechanism to explain delayed attenuation of Jak-Stat activation during leishmania infection could involve induction of cellular phosphotyrosine phosphatases .
One potential candidate is a hematopoietic cell phosphatase ( known otherwise as PTP1C , SHP , or SHPTP1 ) that is expressed in macrophages as well as in other myeloid cells and that is known to negatively regulate Jak-dependent signaling ( 5 ) .
While there is no direct support for this possibility , indirect support is provided by the finding that at least two dual-specificity , stress-activated phosphoprotein phosphatases , PAC-1 ( 19 ) and MKP-1 ( 6 ) , are induced during leishmania infection of macrophages ( 132 ) .
In summary , the results of the present study provide direct evidence for the attenuation of gamma interferon-induced activation of Jak1 and Jak2 and phosphorylation of Statl in U-937 cells infected with L. donovani .
Evidence that this effect is selective is provided by the finding that gamma interferon-induced changes in whole-cell tyrosine phosphorylation are not impaired in infected cells .
This result also implies that gamma interferon-mediated cell signaling in mononuclear phagocytes leading to changes in the levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation involves protein tyrosine kinases in addition to Jak1 and Jak2 , protein tyrosine phosphatases with changes in their activities , or both .
The findings presented also suggest that differentiated U-937 cells can be used as a model system to study the effects of infection with L. donovani as well as with other intracellular microbes on gamma interferon-regulated cell signaling .
This conclusion is supported by the finding that infection of human peripheral blood monocytes with L. donovani also results in marked attenuation of the gamma interferon-induced activation of the Jak-Statl pathway .
