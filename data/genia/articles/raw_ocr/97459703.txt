ANGELO SPINEDI , * anp MAURO PIACENTINT ' * Department of Biology , University of Rome `` Tor Vergata , '' Rome , Italy , '' and Department of Biochemistry , University Medical School of Debrecen , Debrecen , Hungary® Received 14 April 1997/Returned for modification 13 May 1997/Accepted 13 June 1997 The retinoblastoma gene product ( pRB ) plays an important role in controlling both cell release from the G ; , phase and apoptosis .
We show here that in the early phases of apoptosis , pRB is posttranslationally modified by a tissue transglutaminase ( tTG ) -catalyzed reaction .
In fact , by employing a novel haptenized lysis synthetic substrate which allows the isolation of glutaminyl-tTG substrates in vivo , we identified pRB as a potential tTG substrate in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis .
In keeping with this finding , we showed that apoptosis of U937 cells is characterized by the rapid disappearance of the 105,000- to 110,000-molecular-weight pRB forms concomitantly with the appearance of a smear of immunoreactive products with a molecular weight of greater than 250,000 .
The shift in pRB molecular weight was reproduced by adding exogenous purified tTG to extracts obtained from viable U937 cells and was prevented by dansylcadaverine , a potent enzyme inhibitor .
The effect of the pRB posttranslational modification during apoptosis was investigated by determining the E2F-1 levels and by isolating and characterizing pRB-null clones from U937 cells .
Notably , the lack of pRB in these U937-derived clones renders these p53-null cells highly resistant to apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal , calphostin C , and ceramide .
Taken together , these data suggest that tTG , acting on the pRB protein , might play an important role in the cell progression through the death program .
Transglutaminases belong to a family of Ca**-dependent enzymes that catalyze cross-linking of polypeptide chains in which the y-carboxamide groups of peptide-bound glutamine residues serve as acyl donors and primary amino groups of several compounds function as acceptor substrates ( 13-15 ) .
The reaction results in the posttranslational modification of proteins by establishing g ( y-glutamyl ) lysine cross-linkages and/or covalent incorporation of biogenic amines ( di- and polyamines and histamine ) into proteins ( 13 , 37 ) .
The transglutaminase-dependent formation of stable cross-links induces protein polymerization which confers high resistance to mechanical and chemical attack to the polypeptides involved in the linkage ( 11 , 13 ) ; in fact , these polymers can be destroyed only by proteolytic degradation of the protein chains ( 12 , 13 ) .
Tissue transglutaminase ( tTG ) binds guanine nucleotides and hydrolyzes GTP ( 15 ) .
Nakaoka et al .
( 34 ) have demonstrated that the 74-kDa a subunit ( G , , , ) associated with the 50-kDa B subunit of the GTP-binding protein , G , , , is tTG .
This dimer acts in association with the rat liver a , -adrenergic receptor in a ternary complex .
Thus , G , , , ( tTG ) is a multifunctional protein which not only acts as a transglutaminase but , by binding GTP ( in a G , , , ,-GTP complex ) , activates phospholipase C after receptor stimulation ( 34 ) .
Recently , much emphasis has been given to the genetic control exerted by various regulatory elements during the early phases of the death program , which results in the synthesis and/or activation of effector killer genes ( 8 , 17 ) .
The tTG gene is one of the few genes induced during apoptosis ( 17 , 38 , 39 ) .
In fact , tTG protein is undetectable in the majority of cells , and * Corresponding author .

6040 its mRNA is transcribed as a consequence of the induction of apoptosis ( 38 , 39 ) .
However , the tTG gene is constitutively expressed in some cell types , including endothelial cells , smooth muscle cells , and mesangial cells in vivo ( for a review , see reference 39 ) .
It has been shown that tTG not only is associated with apoptosis but in some cell types may also play an important role in the killing process ( 14 , 30 , 41 ) .
Overexpression of tTG in human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE ( 2 ) cells , L929 cells , and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts enhances their susceptibility to undergo apoptosis ( 14 , 30 , 41 ) .
Human neuroblastoma cells overexpressing tTG showed a large reduction in their growth capacity , not only in vitro but also when xenografted into SCID mice ( 30 , 40 ) .
By contrast , transfection of the same neuroblastoma cells with an expression vector containing a segment of the human tTG cDNA in the antisense orientation resulted in a decrease of both spontaneous and retinoic acid ( RA ) -induced apoptosis ( 30 ) .
It is difficult at the moment to establish the precise position of tTG in the cascade of events leading to apoptosis .
However , a large body of evidence indicates that tTG induction parallels or slightly precedes be/-2 downregulation and is not susceptible to the inhibitory effect of Bel-2 protein ( 30 ) .
The present study was undertaken to investigate whether in the early stages of apoptosis , the controlled tTG-mediated posttranslational modification of a specific protein substrate ( s ) might have a role in cell commitment to apoptosis .

Cell culture .
The parental U937 cell line was grown at 37°C , under a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO ; in air , in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % ( vol/vol ) heat-inactivated FCS , 2 mM 1-glutamine , 100 U of penicillin per ml , and 100 mg of streptomycin per ml .
Where indicated , prior to treatment with calphostin C , cells ( 5 X 10°/ml ) were shifted overnight to a growth medium containing 0.5 % serum .
Drug administration and the initial 20-min incubation were carried out in the dark ; cells were then exposed to light for a further 20 min , and incubation was allowed to proceed in an incubator with occasional cell exposure to microscope light ; control samples were treated with the proper amounts of carrier dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) and run in parallel .
In those experiments employing dansyleadaverine ( 1 mM final concentration ) , the tTG inhibitor was added 1 h before calphostin C administration .
For the RA studies , cells were plated at 50 X 10° cells/cm '' in growth medium containing 1 uM RA ( from a 5 mM stock solution dissolved in 70 % ethanol ) and 1.25 % DMSO .
Medium was replaced daily .
Control cultures were treated with 0.07 % ethanol .
Cell numbers and viability were evaluated in a Thoma hemocy-tometer chamber .
For the isolation of DALP { 3- [ N- « , Ne- ( 2',4'-dinitrophenyl ) -amino-z-hex-anoyl-L-lysylamido } -propane-1-ol } -labeled protein , lysates obtained from U937 cells treated for 72 h with RA in the presence of 1.25 % DMSO were precipitated with cold acetone and then treated with 100 % trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min on ice to hydrolyze carbamate esters , lyophilized , and redissolved in 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -125 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 6.8 ) -0.01 % bromophenol blue .
The sample was applied to a PrepCell 491 ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , Calif. ) filled with 3 % gel .
Isolated proteins were applied to a column ( 0.5 by 5 cm ) filled with rabbit anti-dinitrophenyl immunoglobulins coupled with hydra-zide-linked beads prepared with an Affi-gel Hz immunoaffinity kit ( Bio-Rad Laboratories ) .

TISSUE TRANSGLUTAMINASE AND pRB IN APOPTOSIS - 6041 RESULTS Identification of tTG substrate proteins in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis .
We used DALP , a novel synthetic substrate of tTG that is able to permeate cells , to isolate and identify glutaminyl-tTG substrate proteins in cells undergoing apoptosis ( 35 ) .
The substrate properties of DALP were tested by detecting its tTG-dependent incorporation into dimethyl-ated casein and identification of y-glutamyl-DALP ( 35 ) .
The K , , of DALP ( 3 LM ) is about 50-fold lower than that of the best available amine substrate of tTG ( 35 ) .
The carbamate methyl ester derivative of DALP is nontoxic and easily penetrates into the U937 cells , where is hydrolyzed by cellular esterases and , in the presence of tTG , covalently incorporates into cellular proteins ( 35 ) .
Proteins bearing the haptenic group were isolated from U937 cells undergoing apoptosis upon treatment with RA , a potent inducer of tTG and apoptosis ( Fig .
1 ; see reference 39 for a review ) , by immunoaffinity chro-matography with antibodies against the dinitrophenyl haptenic group of DALP ( Fig .
2 ) .
Analysis of the isolated proteins revealed that the major DALP-labeled proteins in U937 undergoing apoptosis had molecular masses of 43 , 90 , and 110 kDa ; in addition , we isolated protein aggregates which could not enter the gel ( Fig .
2A ) .
It is interesting that no substrate proteins were isolated from viable U937 cells , thus suggesting that they act as a tTG substrate only in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis ( data not shown ) .
By immunostaining the blots obtained from the affinity-purified proteins with the C15 anti-human pRB monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) , we found that the band showing an MW of 110,000 was specifically recognized by the anti-pRB MAb ( Fig .
2A ) ; the same results were obtained by using an anti-pRB MAb corresponding to amino acids 619 to 928 ( not shown ) .
The SDS-insoluble high- MW protein complex was also stained , suggesting that pRB might be incorporated into this large protein polymer as a conseque of a tTG-dependent reaction .
In a separate set of experiments , the 43-kDa tTG protein substrate isolated with an immunoaffinity column and not stained by the two anti-pRB MAbs was identified as actin ( 35 ) .
To investigate whether pRB may indeed act as a substrate for tTG in U937 cells , we incubated crude U937 cell extracts in the presence of purified tTG for 60 min ( Fig .
2B ) .
After incubation , the cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-7.5 % PAGE and immunoblotted with the previously reported anti-human pRB MAb ( Fig .
2B ) .
In control cells , this antibody evidenced a broad band in the 105- to 110-kDa area , corresponding to pRB in different phosphorylation states , and a smaller 68-kDa product recently identified in U937 cells as one of the cleavage products of pRB by caspase ( 5 , 22 ) .
Treatment of cells with tTG brought about a dramatic modification of this pattern , consistent with the rapid disappearance of the pRB 105- to 110-kDa immunopositive band ( s ) and the appearance of a smear of products with molecular masses higher than 250 kDa ( Fig .
2B ) .
pRB acts as a tTG substrate in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis .
Calphostin C , a potent and selective protein kinase C inhibitor ( 6 ) , has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in various cell systems ( 23 , 28 ) and to sensitize cells to apoptosis induced by other agents ( 31 ) .
In U937 cells maintained in 0.5 % serum and treated with 250 nM calphostin C , the onset of apoptosis was observed 1 h after drug administration , and by 3 h about 70 to 80 % of cells had died ( Fig .
3 ) .
Figure 3b shows that calphostin C-induced apoptosis , at its onset , was consistent with a selective loss of cells in the G , phase of the cycle .
It has been established that multiple phosphorylation of pRB is a key event in the control of G , -to-S cell cycle phase transition and apoptosis ( 22 , 43 ) .
We therefore investigated the effect of 6042 OLIVERIO ET AL .

calphostin C-induced apoptosis on pRB .
As shown for RA-induced apoptosis ( Fig .
1 ) , calphostin C-induced apoptosis also occurs in the presence of increased tTG activity ( 45 + 10 pmol/h/mg of protein in untreated U937 cells versus 220 + 35 pmol/h/mg of protein in 250 nM calphostin C-treated U937 cells ) .
Lysates of U937 cells treated with calphostin C for 30 or 60 min were analyzed by SDS-7.5 % PAGE and immunoblotted with the C15 anti-human pRB MAb .
In untreated cells ( maintained for 18 h in 0.5 % FCS ) this antibody evidenced the broad band in the 105,000- to 110,000-MW area corresponding to pRB in different phosphorylation states together with the Other band showing an MW of 68,000 ( Fig .
4A ) .
Treatment of cells with calphostin C brought about a drastic modification of this pattern , consistent with the rapid disappearance of all of the pRB-immunopositive bands ( Fig .
4A ) ; in addition , in keeping with the in vitro experiments reported in Fig .
2B , the smear of products with MWs higher than 250,000 was also detected .
To confirm that the effect of calphostin C on pRB was dependent on tTG action , we blocked tTG activity ( before the addition of calphostin C ) by treating U937 cells with 1 mM dansylcadaverine , a well-known tTG inhibitor ( 15 ) .
As shown in Fig .
4A , the disappearance of the pRB 105,000- to 110,000-MW and 68,000-MW bands observed in calphostin C-treated cells was largely reduced in the presence of dansylcadaverine , thus confirming the hypothesis that pRB acts as a substrate for tTG in cells undergoing apoptosis .
It is interesting that in some experiments , calphostin C-induced disappearance of the pRB 105,000- to 110,000-MW bands was not quantitative ; in this case , residual pRB ( 10 to 20 % of the total pRB immunostaining ) was found in the hypophosphorylated form ( Fig .
4B ) .
Although this phenomenon remains to be better investigated in future studies , at present one could entertain the possibility that the hyperphosphorylated pRB might be a better substrate for the tTG than the hypophosphorylated counterpart .
The phosphorylation , for instance , could modify pRB folding , making the lysine and glutamine residues better exposed on the surface to the action of tTG .
Isolation and characterization of pRB-null U937 cell lines .
To investigate the functional relationship between pRB and tTG in apoptosis , we attempted to isolate U937 cells which had a null pRB expression .
By using a limiting-dilution approach , we were able to isolated several clones which showed a specific reduction in the levels of pRB ( Fig .
5A ) .
In fact , no significant changes in the expression of other genes , such as be/-2 and the 6044 OLIVERIO ET AL .

The axes represent 580-nm fluorescence emission by propidium iodide ( x ) and number of events ( y ) .
Note the time-dependent increase in the number of calphostin-C-treated U937 cells detected as apoptotic with the respect to cells in G , and S/G phases .
mitogen-activated protein kinase gene , or in basal tTG activity were detected ( Fig .
5A ) .
The data shown in Table 1 indicate that the absence of pRB expression observed in the U937 clones was associated with a net decrease in the sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli .
In fact , the pRB-null cells were much less prone to apoptosis induction elicited by growth factor withdrawal , C6-ceramide , and calphostin C ( Table 1 ) .
As expected , when we tested the effect of calphostin C-induced apoptosis on pRB-null clones , we did not observe the appearance of the pRB-immunopositive products with MWs higher than 250,000 that we detected in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis ( Fig .
5A ) .
Effect on E2F-1 of calphostin C-dependent induction of apoptosis in U937 cells .
The E2F-1 transcription factor plays a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle progression at the G , -S transition and apoptosis ( 18 , 20 , 44 , 45 ) .
It has recently been demonstrated that E2F-1 is actively degraded by the ubiquitin ( Ub ) -proteasome pathway and that the binding to pRB stabilizes E2F-1 against in vivo degradation ( 18 , 20 ) .
In order to get information on the functional activity of pRB during calphostin C-induced apoptosis , we investigated the effect of this protein kinase C inhibitor on E2F-1 protein levels ( Fig .
6 ) .
Lysates of U937 cells maintained in 0.5 % serum and treated with calphostin C for 30 or 60 min were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-human E2F-1 ( epitope corresponding to amino acids 418 to 437 ) .
In control cells , this antibody evidenced a band showing an MW of about 60,000 ( Fig .
6 ) .
Treatment of cells with calphostin C brought about a rapid modification of this pattern , leading to the disappearance of the E2F-1-immunopositive band ( Fig .

pression is not a late epiphenomenon , since antisense tTG transfection did not affect disposal and degradation of ( poorly cross-linked ) apoptotic bodies but actually reduced apoptosis 30 ) .
( B ) y using various experimental approaches , we have provided evidence that in U937 cells the polymerization of pRB , which precedes apoptosis , is mediated by its posttranslational modification catalyzed by tTG .
Furthermore , we have shown that in these p53-null cells ( 26 ) , the lack of pRB largely increases the resistance to apoptosis induced by different stimuli .
Previous studies suggested that an extensive tTG activation leads to the assembly of intracellular cross-linked protein poly-mers , which irreversibly modifies the cell organization , contributing to the widespread , ultrastructural changes occurring in cells undergoing apoptosis ( 10 , 11 , 25 ) .
This extensive tTG-dependent protein polymerization stabilizes apoptotic cells be fore their clearance by phagocytosis , thus contributing to the prevention of inflammation in the surrounding tissues ( 3 , 11 , 17 , 38 , 41 ) .
The question arises as to whether in the early stages of the death pathway , a regulated tTG-mediated posttranslational modification of a specific protein substrate ( s ) might have a role in the commitment to apoptosis .
In keeping with this hypothesis , we showed that during the early phases of apoptosis , tTG posttranslationally modifies pRB , thus suggesting that the activation of this cross-linking enzyme might determine an irreversible commitment to death .
In fact , pRB polymerization was already detectable after 10 to 20 min in calphostin C-treated U937 cells , when the level of apoptosis was still unchanged ( Fig .
4 ) .
pRB plays a key role in cell cycle control ( 7 , 43 ) .
It is generally accepted that pRB , in the hypophosphorylated state , binds to and impairs the activities of several proteins , including 6046 OLIVERIO ET AL .

the transcription factors of the E2F family ( 7 , 33 ) .
The range of pRB functions has recently been discovered to be more com-plex , since it has been shown that the absence of functional pRB may result in apoptosis rather than in uncontrolled cell proliferation ( 1 , 32 , 42 ) and that overexpression of functional pRB may induce apoptosis or rescue cells from death , depending on the system ( 16 , 29 , 46 ) .

ing liver erythropoiesis and neuronal development ( 43 ) .
The question arises as to the functional implications of the tTG-dependent polymerization of pRB occurring during the early phases of apoptosis .
In keeping with the possibility that pRB polymerization might lead to its functional inactivation , we showed that the tTG-dependent polymerization of pRB is paralleled by the rapid disappearance of E2F-1 , which occurs when the transcription factor is not protected by pRB binding from entering the Ub-proteasome pathway ( 18 , 20 ) .
U937 cells provide a p53-null line ( reference 26 and our unpublished observations ) , leading to the question of whether loss of pRB function is sufficient for the occurrence of apoptosis .
Indeed , the simultaneous absence of pRB and p53 is not incompatible with life .
In fact , we have showed here that the absence of pRB leads to a an increased resistance to several apoptotic stimuli , such as growth factor deprivation and calphostin C and C6é-ceramide treatment .
Taken together , these findings suggest that the polymerization of pRB observed in U937 cells might represent a key signal for the initiation of apoptosis .
By contrast , the lack of pRB , in the absence of p53 , may have dramatic consequence for cycling cells .
In fact , as we observed for the U937-derived pRB-null cell clones , this condition results in 83 -- » serem ag _- E2F - !

TISSUE TRANSGLUTAMINASE AND pRB IN APOPTOSIS - 6047 uncontrolled proliferation associated with a high resistance to apoptosis ( 44 ) .
It is now becoming clear that in cells undergoing apoptosis , a set of specific proteins are degraded mainly by the caspase family of proteases ( 27 ) .
It has recently been demonstrated that pRB also is a substrate for interleukin-converting enzyme-like proteases in the context of apoptosis induced by certain antitumor drugs ( 5 , 22 ) .
It is interesting that several substrates for the caspases ( 27 ) are also substrates for tTG in vivo .
In fact , in addition to pRB , actin ( 25 , 35 ) and histones ( 4 ) are posttranslationally modified in cells undergoing apoptosis induced by both tTG and caspases .
The functional significance and the reciprocal influence of these two events in the commitment to and execution of apoptosis are interesting matters for future studies .
In conclusion , the data reported in this paper seem to indicate that tTG might have more than one function within the cascade of events leading to the establishment of the apoptotic phenotype : ( i ) an early regulatory function which , through the polymerization of pRB , may influence the decision to undergo apoptosis or to survive , and ( ii ) a late effect leading to the stabilization of the dying cells by the formation of intracellular cross-linked protein polymers ( 41 ) .
Recent experiments have suggested that cells may undergo a process morphologically similar to apoptosis without a nucleus and in the absence of de novo protein synthesis by simply activating the downstream elements ( 17 , 21 ) , thus suggesting that all machinery is already in place before the apoptotic signal and that , at least in some circumstances , the final events of apoptosis may be controlled at the posttranslational level .
The plasticity provided by a multifunctional enzyme like tTG represents an interesting example of how a complex phenomenon such as apoptosis may be regulated at the posttranslational level .
The modulation of the tTG activity or G , , , protein functions by the intracellular environment ( such as the levels of GTP , Ca** , and free di- and polyamines ) may have a relevant role in the decision of cells to survive or die .
