3 Cloning of the Novel Human Myeloid-Cell-Specific C/EBP -g Transcription Factor ALEXEY M. CHUMAKOV , * ISABELLE GRILLIER , EKATERINA CHUMAKOVA , DORIS CHIH , JAMES SLATER , anp H. PHILLIP KOEFFLER Division of Hematology/Oncology , Department of Medicine , Cedars-Sinai Medical Center , UCLA School of Medicine , Los Angeles , California 90048 Received 24 July 1996/Returned for modification 4 September 1996/Accepted 23 December 1996 Chicken NF-M transcription factor , in cooperation with either c-Myb or v-Myb , is active in the combinatorial activation of myeloid-cell-specific genes in heterologous cell types , such as embryonic fibroblasts .
In humans , similar effects were observed with homologous members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) family of transcriptional regulators , especially the human homolog of chicken NF-M , C/EBP -B ( NF-IL6 ) .
However , the NF-IL6 gene is expressed in a variety of nonmyeloid cell types and is strongly inducible in response to inflammatory stimuli , making it an unlikely candidate to have an exclusive role as a combinatorial differentiation switch during myelopoiesis in human cells .
By using a reverse transcription-PCR-based approach and a set of primers specific for the DNA-binding domains of highly homologous members of the C/EBP family of transcriptional regulators , we have cloned a novel human gene encoding a member of the C/EBP gene family , identified as the human homolog of CRP1 , C/EBP-s. A 1.2-kb cDNA encoding full-length human C/EBP-s was cloned from a promyelocyte-late myeloblast-derived Agt11 library .
Molecular analysis of the cDNA and genomic clones indicated the presence of two exons encoding a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa and a pI of 9.5 .
Primer extension analysis of C/EBP-s mRNA detected a single major transcription start site approximately 200 bp upstream of the start codon .
The putative promoter area is similar to those of several other myeloid-cell-specific genes in that it contains no TATAAA box but has a number of purine-rich stretches with multiple sites for the factors of the Ets family of transcriptional regulators .
Northern blot analyses indicated a highly restricted mRNA expression pattern , with the strongest expression occurring in promyelocyte and late-myeloblast-like cell lines .
Western blot and immunoprecipitation studies using rabbit antibodies raised against the N-terminal portion of C/EBP -£ ( amino acids 1 to 115 ) showed that C/EBP-s is a 32-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein .
The human C/EBP-g protein exhibited strong and specific binding to double-stranded DNA containing consensus C/EBP sites .
Cotransfection of the C/EBP -£ sense and antisense expression constructs together with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter vectors containing myeloid-cell-specific c-mim and human myeloperoxidase promoters suggested a role for C/EBP -£ transcription factor in the regulation of a subset of myeloid-cell-specific genes .
Transient tranfection of a promyelocyte cell line ( NB4 ) with a C/EBP-e expression plasmid increased cell growth by sevenfold , while antisense C/EBP -s caused a fivefold decrease in clonal growth of these cells .
A family of transcriptional regulators known as CCAAT/ enhancer-binding proteins ( C/EBP ) currently includes C/EBP- « , C/EBP-B ( NF-IL6 , CRP2 ) , C/EBP-8 ( NF-IL6-B , CRP3 ) , Ig-C/EBP , GADD15S3 ( CHOP ) proteins , as well as two homologous genes whose expression has not been detected , CRP1 and HS8 ( 1 , 15 , 17 , 25 , 37 , 67 , 68 , 84 , 86 ) .
These proteins have highly homologous C-terminal basic DNA-binding and dimerization domains and much less conserved N-terminal regulatory and transactivation domains .
C/EBP-B and C/EBP-8 are important for signal transduction , being nuclear effectors of cytokine-induced gene expression in cells of various stages and directions of differentiation ( 1 , 2 , 39 , 66 ) .
C/EBP - « is predominantly expressed in adipocytes and hepa-tocytes , but it is also expressed in numerous other cell types and is important for adipocyte differentiation ( 13 , 15 , 19 , 28 , 38 , 40 , 50 , 51 , 65 , 69 , 81 ) .
Recently , C/EBP- « has also been implicated in monocytes , where it can cooperate with the transcription factor AML1 to form a heterodimer which mediates activation of the promoter of the macrophage colony-stimulat- * Corresponding author .

So far , C/EBP -like proteins do not appear to have clear differences in their DNA-binding preferences , and possibly the context of any given DNA-binding site and combinatorial interaction with other transcription factors , such as Myb or AML-1 , may determine the subset of genes that are regulated by each individual C/EBP protein ( 14 , 89 ) .
In the past few years , studies of chicken myelomonocyte-specific c-mim and c-MGF gene regulation has led to identification of chicken NF-M ( C/EBP-B ) as a component of the combinatorial switch , which is involved in regulation of myeloid genes in cooperation with the c-Myb protein ( 14 , 61 , 70 ) .
However , in the mammalian system , expression of the protein most closely homologous to chicken NF-M at the amino acid level is NF-IL6 ( CRP2 , C/EBP -B ) , but it is not restricted to cells of the myelomonocytic lineage , as this factor is drastically and abundantly induced in all tissues after stimulation with either lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or other inflammatory signals ( 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 15 , 16 , 87 , 88 ) .
This suggests that NF-IL6 , like another member of the C/EBP family of transcriptional regulators , GADD153 , may be involved in functional activation of cells of diverse lineages by induction of a certain subset of proteins , such as acute-phase proteins and various LPS-induc-ible cytokines .
1376 CHUMAKOV ET AL .
This hypothesis prompted us to look for a member of the C/EBP family of proteins that is functionally , rather than struc-turally , homologous to avian NF-M and whose expression is limited to cells of the myeloid lineage .
In this investigation , we have reported the cloning of a novel human myeloid-cell-specific C/EBP family member that can cooperate with c-Myb in transactivation and is important for growth and differentiation of myeloid cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Reverse transcription ( RT ) -PCR and cloning of a myeloid-cell-specific C/EBP-related gene .
To make cDNA , total RNA was prepared by using a Pharmacia RNA purification kit ; poly ( A ) * RNA from the promyelocyte-like HL60 cells was purified by two rounds of selection on oligo ( dT ) -Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) as specified by the manufacturer .
Five micrograms of polyadenylated RNA was annealed to a universal oligo ( dT ) -tailed primer ( 5'-TAGGAATTCTCGAGCG GCCGCTTTTITTTTTITITTTTT-3 ' [ T-AMP ] ) at 70°C .
The first strand of cDNA was synthesized by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Gibco-BRL ) essentially as described by the manufacturer .
Between 40 and 200 ng of single-stranded cDNA was then amplified by using one of two gene-specific primers designed to anneal in the area of maximal homology of the C/EBP -like genes [ 5'-TGCGC ( G/T ) CCTACCTGGGCTACCAG ( G/T ) CG-3 ' ( MS-1 ) and 5'.CG ( C/G ) AACAACATCGC ( G/T ) GTGCGCAAGAGCCG-3 ' ( MS-2 ) ] and a universal - downstream - primer ( 5'-TAGGAATTCTCGAGCGGCCGC-3 ' [ AMP ] ) for 35 cycles consisting of 94°C for 1 min , 50°C for 1.5 min , and 72°C for 1.5 min .
The PCR amplification products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis ; candidate bands were excised and used as probes in Northern blot hybridizations with total RNA prepared from numerous hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells .
Fragments showing a tissue-specific expression pattern were cloned into an Smal site of the pTZ19R vector ( Pharmacia ) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method ( Sequenase II kit ; U.S. Biochemicals ) .
cDNA and genomic DNA library screening and isolation of C/EBP-£ clones .
A partial cDNA fragment of C/EBP -e obtained by RT-PCR was used to probe an HL60 cell line-derived Agtll cDNA library ( Clontech ) under high-stringency conditions as previously described ( 53 ) except that a Hybond N-Plus membrane ( Amersham ) was used .
Eleven positive clones were plaque purified and se-quenced , with 10 of them representing C/EBP-e£ cDNA fragments of variable length and 1 representing human C/EBP-a , which is also expressed in HL60 cells .
Similarly , human and murine genes for C/EBP -£ were cloned using genomic ADASH ( Stratagene ) libraries according to the protocol of the provider and mapped by partial digestion with restriction enzymes and hybridization with arm-specific probes ( derived against the T7 and T3 promoters , respectively ) .
Primer extension .
The human C/EBP -£ gene-specific primer used in this study was CTCGATGTAGGCGGAGAGGTC ( 2UP ) .
Fifty nanograms of primer was labelled by using T4 phage polynucleotide kinase , and approximately 10° cpm of labelled primer was annealed to 20 pg of poly ( A ) * RNA which was prepared by using two rounds of selection on oligo ( dT ) -Sepharose according to the instructions of manufacturer ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
Primer extension was performed with Superscript RTII reverse transcriptase at 42°C according to the directions of the manufacturer ( Gibco-BRL ) .
Primer extension products were separated in 6 % polyacrylamide sequencing gels by the dideoxy sequencing reaction performed with the same primer and plasmid DNA as size markers .
Plasmid chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter constructs .
The c-mim promoter , representing the 0.7-kb 5 ' region , was obtained by Pfu PCR amplification of chicken genomic DNA and mim-specific primers ( GGCCTCG AGAACTGTGGCTITTGGCACCATCCATTTC [ CMIMS ] and GGCTCTAGAG CGAGTCAAAGACGTCCTCAAGTAG [ CMIM3 ] ) cut with XhoI and Xbel , inserted into Sall and Xbel sites of the pCATBasic promoterless reporter vector ( Promega ) , and sequenced .
To make the human myeloperoxidase ( hMPO ) promoter construct , an 3.8-kb Pvull fragment of the cloned hMPO gene ( courtesy of Giovanni Rovera , Wistar Institute ) was cloned into plasmid pBL2CAT ( 52 ) .
The structures and orientations of the inserts were in all cases verified by dideoxy sequencing with the Sequenase kit ( U.S. Biochemicals ) .
Transfection and CAT and clonogenic assays .
Transient transfection assays were performed with HL60 cells , a human promyelocytic cell line ( from the American Type Culture Collection ) which expresses C/EBP-£ mRNA and protein .

NB4 promyelocytes , Kel22 myeloblasts , myelomonocytic U937 cells , carly myeloblast KG1 cells , T-lymphoblast CEM cells , and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were grown in the same medium with 10 % fetal calf serum .
All other cell lines used in transfection experiments were maintained according to the directions of the supplier ( American Type Culture Collection ) .
Cells were fed the day before transfection and were grown to a density of 10° ml~ ' .
Thirty micrograms of the reporter plasmids and 30 ug of the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) -luciferase controls were cotransfected by electroporation ( 250 V , 960 mF ; Bio-Rad ) , using 2.5 X 10 '' cells per sample .
The CMV-luciferase plasmid ( 1 pg ) was cotransfected as a marker of transfection efficiency ( 252 ) .

In vitro translation was carried out by standard protocols with the TNT reticulocyte lysate system ( Promega ) .
Cell fractionation and Western blotting .
Kel22 cells ( 10° m1l~ ' ) were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and once in ice-cold RSB buffer ( 10 mM Tris-Cl [ pH 7.4 ] , 10 mM NaCl , 25 mM EDTA ) , resuspended in 100 pl of ice-cold RSB buffer in the presence of cycle protease inhibitors ( 1 mM phenylmethylsul-fonyl fluoride , 10 ug of leupeptin per ml , 10 ug of pepstatin per ml , and 100 ug of aprotinin per ml ) and transferred to a chilled Dounce homogenizer .
Cells were lysed by 10 strokes of a type B pestle following the addition of Nonidet P-40 detergent to 0.5 % .
Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge and washed once with ice-cold RBS buffer .
Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions ( 30 g ) were denatured by addition of 2 % electrophoresis sample buffer ( 120 mM Tris-Cl [ pH 6.8 ] , 4 % SDS , 25 % glycerol , 3 % B-mercap-toethanol ] , incubated for 10 min at 90°C , and separated on a 12.5 % polyacrylamide gel .
Western blotting and immunodetection were done by standard meth-ods , as recommended by the supplier of the ECL detection system ( Amersham ) .
Purified rabbit polyclonal anti-C/EBP-£ antibody ( 18 g/m ! )
was incubated with the blocked membrane for 1 h at room temperature , and bound antibody was detected with an anti-rabbit antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate ( Amersham ) .
Following cell washing and lysis , immunoprecipitation was done as described previously ( 21 ) , with protein A-Sepharose and 1 pl of anti-C/EBP-e rabbit polyclonal antiserum or control preimmune antiserum .
Following separation on a 12.5 % polyacrylamide gel , proteins were transferred by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Immobilon-P ; Millipore ) and exposed without drying to X-ray film overnight .
The C/EBP-e-specific band was then detected by Western blot hybridization with purified antibody and detection of the signal with the ECL system ( Amersham ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
For gel retardation assays , the oligonucleotide probe was end labelled with [ y-P ] ATP , annealed , and used as a binding probe .
The gel retardation assay was performed with approximately 1 ng of the double-stranded probe containing an optimal C/EBP binding site in a self-complementary - oligonucleotide 5'-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3 ' ( 73 , 83 ) , 3 ul of programmed rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( ~10 ug of protein } , and 0.5 mg of salmon sperm DNA ( as a nonspecific competitor ) in a total volume of 12 pl of the binding buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7.9 ] , 20 % glycerol , 125 mM NaCl , 1.5 mM MgC ] , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride , 10 pg of leupeptin per ml , 10 mg of pepstatin per ml , and 100 pg of aprotinin per ml ) ( 22 ) .
After 30 min of incubation at room temperature , the products were separated on native polyacrylamide gels ( 4.5 % in 1 % Tris-borate-EDTA ) , dried , and visualized by autoradiography ( 22 , 48 ) .
Oligonucleotide 5'-TGCAGAGACTAGTCTCTGCA-3 ' containing a mutated C/EBP binding motif was added as a control probe in the competition assay .
Nuclear extracts for detection of in vivo-expressed C/EBP -s were prepared essentially as described previously ( 22 ) .
The gel retardation assay was performed as described above , except that complementary oligonucleotides contained C/EBP-binding sites found in the M-CSF receptor promoter ( 89 ) : CAAGATT TCCAAACTCT ( 88-73A ) and AGAGTTTGGAAATCTTG ( 88-73B ) , and CAAGATTITTCCAAACTCTGTGGTTGCCTTGC ( CAMLA ) and GCAAGGC AACCACAGAGTTTGGAAATCTTG ( CAMLB ) .

RESULTS Cloning of cDNA encoding the promyelocyte-specific human C/EBP -like protein .
Sequence alignment of previously cloned members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors revealed a highly homologous stretch of basic amino acid residues in the DNA-binding domain .
This sequence was used to prepare a 29-mer oligonucleotide primer degenerate in the second position ( see Materials and Methods for details ) .
Polyadenylated mRNA was prepared from the human leukemic cell line HL60 , arrested at the promyelocyte-late myeloblast stage of differentiation ( 53 ) .
An oligo ( dT ) -tailed oligonucleotide primer was used to reverse-transcribe mRNA ; the second strand of cDNA was synthesized by using C/EBP -specific primers , and PCR was used to amplify potential C/EBP -like cDNAs ( Fig .
1A ) .
The resulting RT-PCR products were then analyzed by Northern hybridization with a panel of RNAs representing cell lines of hematopoietic ( myeloid , B- and T-lymphocyte , erythroid , mast , megakaryocyte ) and nonhematopoietic lineage .
One of the candidate RT-PCR products was found to be specifically expressed only in the HL60 and PLB985 cell lines , not in other myeloid cell lines arrested at either earlier ( KG1 ) or later ( U937 ) stages of differentiation and not in any nonmyeloid cells .
Cloning and sequencing of this RT-PCR product confirmed its homology to other C/EBPs .
This cDNA fragment was used as a probe to clone a full-length C/EBP -g cDNA from a random-primed Agt11 HL60 cDNA library ( Clontech ) .
Out of 11 positive independent phage clones , 10 represented human C/EBP -£ cDNAs of different lengths and least one represented human C/EBP - « that was also expressed in HL6O cells .
The longest cDNA fragment found in one of these clones , A9.2 , was subcloned into a plasmid and sequenced .
This cDNA of 1.2 kb has a poly ( A ) tail of approximately 80 nucleotides , with the polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA 163 nucleotides 3 ' of the TGA stop codon , and encodes a protein with a predicted 1378 CHUMAKOV ET AL .

The analysis used mRNA prepared from the C/EBP early myeloblast cell line KG1 , a myelomonocytic cell line ( U937 ) , T-lymphoblast CEM , and C/EBP-g-positive promyelocytic cells ( HL60 ) .
The size of the single primer extension product ( 200 nucleotides [ nt ] upstream from the ATG codon ) is indicated by a horizontal arrow .
Reverse transcriptase ( Superscript II ; Gibco-BRL ) was used to extend the C/EBP-e-specific primer ( 2UP ; see Materials and Methods for details ) at 42°C .
The sequencing reaction , using the same primer and the C/EBP -£ promoter-containing plasmid DNA , was run on the same gel as a size marker ( the C-specific termination reaction is shown in the lane on the right ) .

Sequence analysis using the BLAST algorithm and the GCG program ( 6 , 29 ) revealed its significant degree of homology to other previously cloned C/EBP proteins , especially to a putative product of the rat C/EBP -like sequence , CRP1 , previously identified by Williams et al .
( 84 ) .
Low-stringency hybridization with the Zoo-blot ( Clontech ) , representing genomic DNA of several vertebrate species , revealed two bands of 5.5 and 6.3 kb for human DNA digested with EcoRI and two bands of approximately 7.2 and 6 kb in murine EcoRI-digested genomic DNA ( data not shown ) .
Cloning of human and murine genes encoding C/EBP-s .
Using human C/EBP-g cDNA as a probe , we have screened human and murine lambda genomic DNA libraries ( Stratagene ) under high-stringency conditions .
Positive clones were plaque purified and subjected to restriction mapping by partial digestion ( Fig .
ZA ) .
An 18-kb human genomic insert and a 13-kb murine genomic fragment were then subcloned into pTZ19R vectors and partially sequenced .
Both the human and the murine genes contained two exons , interrupted by a short intron of less than 1 kb , and encoded highly conserved proteins ( 94.4 % identical and 96.8 % homologous ) .
Primer extension analysis of the human C/EBP -£ gene transcription start site was performed with an antisense oligonucleotide that bound to DNA approximately 40 bp downstream of the ATG codon .
As shown in Fig .
2B , in HL60 cells , C/EBP -£ has a single transcriptional start site , located 200 bp upstream of the ATG codon .
No transcripts were detected in the myeloid cell lines KG1 and U937 or in the T-lymphoblast CEM cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
Promyelocyte-specific expression of C/EBP -e. To study further the expression pattern of the C/EBP-£ gene , we have analyzed RNA from a variety of cell lines and also primary cell cultures .
The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 1 and Fig .

At the mRNA level , the human C/EBP-£ gene produced a single transcript of approximately 1.2 to 1.3 kb that is exclusively expressed in cell lines arrested at or near the promyelocyte stage of myeloid differentiation ( HL60 , Kel22 , NB4 , SKM1 , and PLB985 ) .

Expression of C/EBP-s£ RNA in human cell lines of various origins .
Total RNA ( 20 ug per lane ) was separated on a 1.25 % agarose gel in the presence of formaldehyde and subjected to Northern blotting ( 51 ) ( see footnotes to Table 1 for details ) .
C/EBP -£ expression was found to be maximal in HL6O cells .
The results of Northern blotting of the RNA preparations are shown ( top panel ) , and ethidium bromide ( EtBr ) staining of the preparations ( bottom panel ) confirms approximately equal loading of RNA in all lanes .
cells , C/EBP -£ exists as a nuclear phosphoprotein ( data not shown ) .
Site-directed mutagenesis must be performed to address the importance of phosphorylation for the functional properties of C/EBP -e. In myeloid cells , differentiation frequently produces mature cells with very limited life spans ; for example , normal granu-locytes , which exhibit endogenous C/EBP -£ expression , have a half-life of only 6 h. The cDNA sequence of C/EBP -£ does not contain any sequences implicated in mRNA instability , and , as shown in Fig .
5 , the half-life of the C/EBP -£ protein is short , between 1 and 1.5 h. The human myeloid-cell-specific C/EBP-£ protein shares a DNA-binding motif with other C/EBP proteins .
We were interested to know if the myeloid-cell-specific member of the C/EBP family of transcriptional regulators had DNA-binding properties similar to those of other known homologs .
Previous experiments have not demonstrated a clear distinction between the DNA-binding preferences of various members of this family .
In vitro , all known C/EBP proteins exhibit high affinity for the oligonucleotide containing an optimal C/EBP sequence ( 73 , 83 ) .
We have studied the interaction of C/EBP -£ with this palindromic motif , as well as a number of other sites that can bind C/EBP and C/EBP -B in gel retardation ( EMSA ) experiments ( Fig .
6A ) .
The C/EBP -£ was able to bind to the consensus CCAAT palindromic site , as seen in lane 2 .
This binding was abolished by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabelled self probe but not by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of mutated double-stranded oligonucleotide in which the CCAAT box was destroyed ( lanes 4 and 5 , respectively ) .
The addition of anti-C/EBP-£ antibody ( lane 3 ) caused a su-pershift of the specific C/EBP-DNA complex , while addition of preimmune rabbit antiserum had no effect ( data not shown ) .
To detect C/EBP DNA binding in myeloid cell lysates , we used consensus C/EBP-binding sites , as well as CCAAT box-containing oligonucleotides derived from the M-CSF receptor promoter ( 89 ) .

Antiserum raised against the bacterially expressed GST-C/EBP -£ fusion protein was tested by immunoprecipitation of in vitro-translated [ *°S ) methionine-labelled C/EBP -£ protein .
Twenty microliters of C/EBP -£ RNA-programmed rabbit reticulocyte lysate was mixed with an equal volume of reticulocyte lysate programmed with the control brome mosaic virus RNA , diluted with 1 ml of PBSTDS solution ( 10 mM dibasic sodium phosphate [ pH 7.2 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X-100 , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 0.2 % sodium azide , 0.004 % sodium fluoride ) ( see Materials and Methods for details ) , and incubated with an aliquot ( 1 ug ) of anti-C/EBP-£ antiserum ( lane 1 ) or preimmune serum ( lane 2 ) .
Following SDS-12 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , the gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film overnight to detect radiolabelled C/EBP -g. ( B ) Expression of the 32-kDa C/EBP -£ protein in transfected COS-1 cells .
COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 10 g of an expression plasmid ( 1.2-kb C/EBP -e cDNA cloned into the CMV promoter-containing peDNAI vector ( Invitrogen , San Diego , Calif. ) in the sense ( C/EBP -£ ) ( lane 1 ) or antisense ( C/EBPAS ) ( lane 2 ) orientation .
At 48 h after transfection , proteins were labelled in vivo in the presence of 100 Ci of [ *S methionine- [ ** $ cysteine labelling mix ( ICN Corp. ) per ml , lysed , and immunoprecipitated in PBSTDS solution with rabbit anti-C/EBP -£ antiserum .

The 32-kDa C/EBP -£ protein ( indicated in lane 2 by the larger arrow ) was detected by using an ECL kit ( Amersham ) following incubation of the blot with rabbit anti-C/EBP-£ specific antibody ( 18 pg/m1 ) .

In NB4 cell lysates , we were unable to detect effective binding of C/EBP -£ to the consensus motif either in the presence or in the absence of anti-C/EBP-£ antibodies ( Fig .

Aliquots were taken at the end of each hour , and the amount of C/EBP -s protein was determined by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies .
The intensities of the C/EBP-e-specific bands were compared with that at the zero time point by densitometry ( data not shown ) .
The half-life of the C/EBP -g protein was determined to be approximately 1.5 h. the presence of anti-C/EBP-£ antibodies .
Oligonucleotides containing a mutated M-CSF receptor CCAAT site ( lane 7 ) and control preimmune antiserum ( lane 6 ) did not produce DNA-protein complexes .
The DNA binding was specific , as evidenced by the lack of disruption of the complex by addition of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled self oligonucleotide containing a mutated CCAAT binding site ( lane 9 ) .
The mobility of DNA-protein complexes containing C/EBP -£ derived from NB4 cells is different from that of complexes formed by in vitro-translated C/EBP -g. Our preliminary results indicate that unlike other C/EBP proteins , C/EBP -£ is very inefficient at forming homodimers and heterodimers with other C/EBP -like proteins in vivo ( data not shown ) .
An oligonucleotide containing the AML-1 binding site from the M-CSF receptor promoter in addition to the nearby C/EBP binding site was able to form a C/EBP-g-specific complex in the presence of anti-C/ EBP -g ( lanes 10 and 11 ) .
Also , the C/EBP -binding site found in the NF-IL6 promoter ( positions 163 to 139 ) was able to bind C/EBP -£ ( lanes 12 and 13 ) .

The C/EBP consensus oligonucleotide probe was mixed with in vitro-expressed recombinant C/EBP -e ( lane 2 ) .
The total amount of programmed rabbit reticulocyte lysate added ( 3 pl ) was identical in all lanes , except that lane 1 contained control lysate lacking C/EBP-g .
The protein was used either alone or in combination with anti-C/EBP-£ antibody ( 1 pl ) ( lane 3 ) .
Approximately 1 ng of radiolabelled double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated at room temperature with programmed lysate in the presence of 1 pg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA .
Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 4.5 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5 % Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at 190 V. NOVEL PROMYELOCYTE-SPECIFIC C/EBP FACTOR - 1381 very helpful in identification of the promyelocyte-specific NF-M activity and eventual cloning of c-NFM ( a C/EBP-B homolog ) ( 41 ) .
The e-mim promoter has been found to be regulated by c-Myb and C/EBP -like proteins and to be functional exclusively in promyelocytes ( 59 ) .
Our preliminary studies indicated that in human cells in transient transfection experiments , the c-nim promoter is also active in HL60 promyelocyte cells but is inactive in the very early myeloblast-like KG1 and monocytic U937 cells .
In transient tranfection experiments in C/EBP HL6O0 cells , the c-mim promoter provides enough background to study the effect of both increased and decreased expression of C/EBP -£ ( Fig .
7A ) .
Cotransfection of the mirm-CAT reporter construct and the CMV promoter-driven C/EBP -g expression plasmid results in an approximately 3.5-fold upregulation of the min promoter activity , while the antisense C/EBP-£ construct decreased the background activity of the mim promoter approximately S-fold .
In the presence of the cotransfected c-Myb expression vector alone , mim promoter activity increased approximately 4.3-fold over the background activity while the cotransfected dominant-negative mutant of c-Myb caused a 3-fold decrease in promoter activity .
Cotransfection of c-Myb and C/EBP -£ expression plasmids did not cause further upregulation of the mim promoter , indicating either a lack of cooperation between these transcription factors or perhaps the presence of some other limiting factor .
In our prior studies , we have identified a number of potential binding sites for members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors upstream of the hMPO promoter ( 20 ) .
Since MPO mRNA expression is maximal in myeloid cells at the promyelocyte stage , which is when C/EBP -£ is also expressed , we tested the ability of C/EBP-g to transactivate the hMPO promoter in CEM T-lymphoblastic cells , which normally lack endogenous C/EBP -g ( Fig .
7B ) .
The C/EBP -£ expression plasmid caused an average 5.2-fold upregulation of the hMPO promoter , while no change was observed with the C/EBP-e antisense expression plasmid .
Transfection of the c-Myb expression vector caused a sixfold activation of the hMPO promoter , consistent with the presence of potential Myb-binding sites upstream of the MPO RNA transcription start site .
The role of endogenous Myb proteins in regulation of the hMPO The arrows indicate the position of a single major C/EBP-s-DNA complex and the same complex supershifted in the presence of anti-C/EBP-£ antibody ( AB ) .
The specificity of binding is demonstrated by complete inhibition of C/EBP-s-DNA complex formation by addition of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabelled probe ( `` self '' ) ( lane 4 ) and by the lack of inhibition of the C/EBP -e-specific band in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabelled oligonucleotide containing a mutated C/EBP-binding motif ( `` mutant '' ) ( see Materials and Methods for details ) .
( B ) EMSA of C/EBP -e derived from nuclear extracts of NB4 cells .
Gel retardation experiments were done with NB4 cell nuclear extracts ( lanes 2 to 13 ) .
Consensus CCAAT box-containing oligonucleotides were used as a probe in the presence and absence of anti-C/EBP-£ antibodies ( lanes 2 and 3 , respectively ) .
Oligonucleotide containing the C/EBP-binding site found in the M-CSF receptor promoter ( 89 ) was used as a probe either alone ( lane 4 ) , in combination with anti-C/EBP -£ antibodies ( lane 5 ) , or with control preimmune antibodies ( lane 6 ) .
Specificity of binding was also demonstrated by the lack of C/EBP-z-containing complexes when a mutant C/EBP site was used as a probe in the presence of anti-C/EBP-£ antibody ( lane 7 ) .
The C/EBP-e-specific band ( right arrow ) was suppressed by addition of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabelled self oligonucleotide ( lane 8 ) but not by addition of the unlabelled mutated C/EBP ( lane 9 ) .
The larger probe , containing the site for AML-1 as well as the CCAAT site , derived from the M-CSF receptor promoter ( lanes 10 and 11 ) , also produced a C/EBP-e-specific band in the presence of the specific antibody ( lane 11 ) .
The C/EBP-binding site found in the NF-IL6 promoter ( positions -163 to -139 ) was used as a probe in the absence and presence of anti-C/EBP-£ antibody ( lanes 12 and 13 , respectively ) .

Western blot analysis of the transiently transfected COS-1 cells was performed with anti-C/EBP-£ antibodies .
Cells were cotransfected either with C/EBP-£ antisense expression plasmid ( pSRe-C/EBPAS ) , 10 ug per 10-cm-diameter plate ( lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ) , or with the same amount of empty pSRaTkneo vector DNA ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 ) in the presence of increasing amounts of C/EBP -£ expression plasmid ( pSRe-C/ EBPS ) ( 0.2 mg per plate in lanes 1 and 2 , 0.5 pg per plate in lanes 3 and 4 , 1 ug per plate in lanes 5 and 6 , 2 pg per plate in lanes 7 and 8 , and 5 ug per plate in lanes 9 and 10 ) .
The C/EBP -e-specific band is indicated by an arrow .
Very little C/EBP -s was expressed even when cells were cotransfected at either a 2:1 or 5:1 antisense-to-sense expression plasmid ratio ( lanes 10 and 8 , respectively ) , and no detectable signal was observed when the ratio was increased to 10:1 , 20:1 , and 50:1 ( lanes 6 , 4 , and 2 , respectively ) .

MCF-7 breast cancer cells , which lack endogenous C/EBP -s , were transfected by lipofection with 3 mg of the same expression plasmids .
Clonogenic assays were performed with G418 ( 800 ug/ml for NB4 and 450 pg/ml for MCF-7 cells ) added to the bottom level of the two-layer soft agar system for either 8 days ( for MCF-7 ) or 15 days ( for NB4 ) .
The figure represents data from three independent experiments .
The number of colonies obtained in each experiment with cells transfected by an empty expression vector was taken as 100 % .
and dose-dependent decrease in the amount of C/EBP -£ pro-duced .
Since our previous studies demonstrated the presence of endogenous C/EBP -£ in several leukemic cell lines arrested at the late myeloblast-promyelocyte stage of differentiation , we tested the consequences of overexpression as well as decreased expression of C/EBP -£ in these cells .
In a clonogenic assay , NB4 cells transfected with the sense C/EBP -£ expression construct showed an average 7-fold increase in colony numbers ( Fig .
8B ) .
Transfection of the C/EBP -£ expression construct into the nonmyeloid breast cancer cell line MCF7 , which lacks endogenous C/EBP -g , caused an approximately 1.5- to 2-fold increase in colony numbers compared to cells transfected with empty-vector DNA ( Fig .

The importance of expression of C/EBP -£ for proliferation of myeloid cells is further emphasized by effects of a transiently transfected antisense C/EBP -g expression construct that caused a fivefold decrease in the Vor .

Under the conditions of these experiments , we did not detect a change in the differentiation pattern of NB4 cells transfected with either the sense or antisense C/EBP -£ construct ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION In this paper , we have reported the cloning of a novel human member of the C/EBP family of transcriptional activators that is exclusively expressed in late myeloblast-promyelocyte-like cells .
All C/EBP family members contain a characteristic basic domain , important for DNA binding and interaction with certain other proteins , and a dimerization domain that contains a leucine zipper and is responsible for the formation of stable , covalently linked homo- and heterodimers of different C/EBP-like proteins .
The hypothesis that transcription factors are key regulators in the development of differentiated cells from multipotential progenitors has led to the identification and characterization of several regulators of myelopoiesis ( 23 , 72 ) .
Numerous members of the major transcription factor groups have been implicated in regulation of various stages of myelopoiesis and/or functional activation of mature myeloid cells .
In particular , these include an AML1 transcription factor complex ( 57 , 76 , 78 ) , several members of the Myb ( 24 , 30 , 32 , 79 ) and Ets ( e.g. , PU.1 [ 18 , 31 , 43 , 75 , 85 ] ) families of transcriptional regulators , zinc finger proteins , ( 12 , 34 ) and helix-loop-helix proteins ( 46 , 62 ) .
The abundance of transcriptional regulators that all play important roles in activation and repression of transcription in myeloid cells suggests the importance of interaction between the various coexpressed proteins and the signal transduction pathways that regulate them in cooperative activation of particular genes .
Recent studies have identified chicken NF-M , which is homologous to mammalian C/EBP -B ( 33 , 74 ) .
It , together with Myb , can function as a combinatorial master switch for several myeloid-cell-specific genes in the chicken ( 41 , 45 , 61 ) .
However , homology between avian NF-M and mammalian C/EBP-B ( NF-IL6 ) does not extend to their expression pat-terns ; while avian NF-M is exclusively expressed in promyelocytes , mammalian NF-IL6 is ectopically expressed in response to inflammatory stimuli and appears to be more important for functional activation of cells of many lineages rather than to be involved in the determination of the differentiation pathway .
Mice with targeted disruption of the NF-IL6 gene do indeed show defects in activation of macrophages , but production and differentiation of macrophages are not blocked ( 71 , 77 ) .
Other studies have observed a pattern of coordinated regulation of three different C/EBP -like proteins , C/EBP- « , C/EBP -B , and C/EBP-8 , in adipocytes as well as differentiating myeloid cells ( 15 , 59 , 70 ) .
The level of expression of C/EBP- « was higher in less-differentiated myeloid cells , while in adipocytes , the level of C/EBP expression paralleled differentiation and was important for the progression of differentiation ( 27 , 81 ) .
Expression of C/EBP-B ( NF-IL6 ) was found to increase gradually as myeloid cells differentiated toward macrophages .
Another C/EBP -like factor , C/EBP -y ( Ig-C/EBP ) , is expressed ubiquitously ( 67 ) .
Considering that any of the C/EBP-like factors can cooperate in the avian system in induction of myeloid-cell-specific genes in nonmyeloid cell types ( 41 , 61 ) , we hypothesized that the role played by homology of the amino acid sequences of a C/EBP protein may be secondary to the restricted pattern of expression and regulation of expression of a particular C/EBP isoform .
Interestingly , expression of the human homolog of the NOVEL PROMYELOCYTE-SPECIFIC C/EBP FACTOR - 1383 chicken myeloid-cell-specific mim-1 ( c-mim ) gene was not restricted to cells of the myeloid lineage , while the tissue-specific pattern of activity of the regulatory region of the c-mim gene was similar in both human and avian cells ( 60 ) .
We thus undertook the task of cloning a putative C/EBP -like factor whose expression pattern resembled chicken NF-M in being restricted to promyelocyte-like or myelomonocytic cells .
RT-PCR with C/EBP -specific primers was performed on RNA from the HL60 cell line , and a cDNA for the C/EBP -£ transcription factor was identified by Northern blot hybridization of candidate PCR products .
As shown in Fig .
3 and Table 1 , a C/EBP-£ mRNA of approximately 1.2 kb was found to be expressed only in cells arrested at or close to the late myeloblast-promyelocyte stage of myeloid differentiation ( HL60 , PLB985 , NB4 , and Kecl22 ) , not by very-early-myeloblast-like KG1 or monocytic U937 cells .
No expression was detected in B and T lymphocytes or in cells of mast , megakaryocyte , erythroid , fibroblast , or epithelial lineage ( Table 1 ) .
Hybridization of a C/EBP -e-specific probe with a Northern blot containing mRNA from multiple normal human tissues gave only a weak signal with peripheral blood leukocyte-derived RNA ( Table 1 ) .
Sequence analysis as well as cloning of the human and murine C/EBP -g genes indicated that they are highly homologous to rat CRP1 sequences and likely represent its human and murine counterparts ( 84 ) .
The rat gene for CRP1 was cloned by relaxed-stringency hybridization , as were two other C/EBP-related genes , CRP2 and CRP3 , which were later identified as NF-IL6 and NF-IL6-B , respectively ( 3 , 42 , 66 ) .
Although no transcripts for CRP1 have been found in any cell type and the gene had the least homology with the other C/EBP factors , it appeared to be a functional gene rather than a pseudogene 84 ) .
( B ) oth the human and murine C/EBP -£ genes , like their rat CRP1 counterpart , which was previously identified by Williams et al .
( 84 ) , have an intron sequence separating the two protein-coding exons .
Although a region of high homology extends further upstream , our data suggest that the ATG codon immediately followed by a codon for cysteine is utilized as the translational start site .
In particular , the apparent molecular weight of endogenous C/EBP -£ is identical to the molecular weight of C/EBP -g derived from cDNA lacking upstream sequences .
Primer extention analysis has identified a single major transcriptional start site about 200 nucleotides upstream of the ATG initiation codon .
The C/EBP-£ promoter is similar to other known myeloid-cell-specific promoters in that it lacks the TATAAA box and contains multiple stretches of purine-rich DNA sequences .
The gene for human C/EBP -£ was mapped to chromosome 14q11 , in the immediate proximity of the T-cell receptor delta gene complex ( 8 , 36 , 44 ) .
This segment of chromosome 14 contains several important groups of genes , all of which are expressed predominantly in cells of the hematopoietic lineage .
The high degree of homology between the murine and human C/EBP-g proteins suggests the existence of a chicken C/EBP -£ ( CRP1 ) homolog .
After this paper had been submitted , Antonson et al .
( 8 ) also reported the cloning and characterization of the human counterpart of CRP1 , C/EBP -e. C/EBP -B and C/EBP-8 were both found to be phosphopro-teins that translocate into the nucleus following threonine phosphorylation of the MAP kinase site ( PGTP ) , which is conserved among murine , chicken , and human homologs of these proteins .
No such site is found in C/EBP - « ( 47 , 64 ) .
We have noted the presence of the MAP kinase site in the sequence of the C/EBP -g protein , at amino acid positions 41 to 44 ( Fig .
1A ) .
Indeed , °°P-labelled C/EBP -g protein was readily detectable in immunoprecipitates with anti-C/EBP-g antiserum , indicating that it is a phosphoprotein ( data not shown ) .
1384 CHUMAKOV ET AL .
However , in all cells that were found to express C/EBP -£ , it was localized exclusively to the nucleus and was detected as a single band of about 32 kDa on Western blotting , suggesting that it is fully phosphorylated .
Similar to the other C/EBP isoforms , C/EBP -£ produced in vitro was able to bind to the optimal C/EBP -binding site ( 73 , 83 ) , and the complex was specifically supershifted by anti-C/ EBP -£ antiserum , suppressed by the addition of unlabelled self competitor , and unaffected by addition of a 10-fold molar excess of similar oligonucleotides which had a mutated CCAAT site ( Fig .
6A ) .
However , we were unable to detect efficient binding of the optimal C/EBP motif to C/EBP -£ derived from myeloid cell nuclear extracts ( Fig .
6B ) .
Another C/EBP -binding site , derived from the promoter of the M-CSF receptor , can form C/EBP-g-containing complexes that migrate more slowly than the putative C/EBP -g homodimer-con-taining complexes produced by in vitro-translated C/EBP -e. The C/EBP -like transcription factors are expressed in a variety of cell types , and some of them , in particular NF-IL6 ( C/EBP -B ) , were reported to interact physically and functionally with other transcriptional factors , such as Myb ( 56 ) , CREB ( 49 , 80 , 82 ) , c-Jun ( 35 ) , glucocorticoid receptor ( 63 ) , and AML-1 ( 89 ) .
In some cases this heterodimerization changes their affinity for various DNA sequences and brings together different regulatory pathways , such as cyclic AMP-dependent signalling or those induced by LPS ( 80 ) , while in others it appears to be important for activity of two transcriptional factors bound to closely spaced DNA sites , as in the case of Myb and C/EBP-B ( 56 ) .
Also , bacterially expressed rat C/EBP -a , C/EBP-B , C/EBP-8 , and CRP1 were shown to be able to form stable homo- and heterodimers covalently linked by disulfide bonds ( 84 ) .
Interestingly , the bacterially expressed fragment of rat CRP1 was less likely to heterodimerize with other C/EBP homologs in vitro as it has less homology in the dimerization domain ( 84 ) .
Further experiments are in progress to identify potential in vivo dimerization partners for C/EBP -g , since our preliminary experiments suggest that it does not form homodimers with high efficiency ( unpublished data ) .
We have also tested the effects of increased and decreased C/EBP-£ expression on the activity of two myeloid-specific promoters , mim-1 and hMPO .
An antisense C/EBP -g expression plasmid can specifically suppress production of C/EBP -E in a dose-dependent fashion ( Fig .
8A ) .
As shown in Fig .
7 , both promoters were significantly upregulated in the presence of the cotransfected C/EBP-g expression vector .
In addition , the mim-1 promoter was downregulated when cotransfected with the antisense C/EBP -g expression construct into the HL60 cell line that expresses endogenous C/EBP -£ .
However , the precise mechanism of this regulation remains unclear , largely due to the presence of other C/EBP homologs that are coexpressed in these cells .
Surprisingly , we saw no synergistic activation of either the mim-1 or MPO promoter by C/EBP -g transfected with a c-Myb expression construct ( Fig .
7 ) .
This may represent a difference in properties of chicken NF-M and human C/EBP -£ with respect to their interaction with c-Myb , although in the avian system , c-Myb was significantly less effective in cooperation with the c-NFM than was mutated v-Myb ( 14 , 61 ) .
We can speculate that perhaps Myb is not a rate-limiting factor in these cells or that C/EBP -g may have a different dimerization partner in human myeloid cells and may be unable to interact directly with Myb , as does chicken NF-M .
Since the ability of NF-M to synergize with Myb in the chicken system is dependent on a physical interaction between the two proteins , our data suggest that in the human system , these factors do activate the same promoter but fail to interact with each other .

BioL .
Finally , we have found that C/EBP -g has a remarkable effect on cell proliferation .
Transfection of a C/EBP-g expression construct caused a sevenfold increase in the number of colonies formed by the NB4 promyelocytic cell line in soft agar .
A modest but significant and consistent growth-stimulatory effect was also noted in nonmyeloid MCF-7 breast cancer cells transfected with the C/EBP -£ expression vector ( Fig .
8B ) .
Since C/EBP-£ expression gradually decreased to zero as myeloid cells differentiated to become nondividing monocytes and macrophages , the continuing cellular proliferation prior to commitment to terminal differentiation of the myeloid cells may be important .
Proliferation of NB4 cells was significantly decreased upon transfection of the C/EBP -£ antisense expression vector .
However , as expected , the antisense expression vector had no effect on cells ( MCF-7 ) lacking C/EBP-£ expression .
C/EBP -a was recently shown to have a growth-inhibitory effect on proliferation of many cells types , and our finding of a growth-stimulatory myeloid-cell-specific homolog of C/EBP may suggest the coexistence of a homeostatic mechanism of positive and negative regulatory signals in the same cells .
Members of the C/EBP family of transcriptional regulators are indeed well suited for this role , as they are able to form complexes with a number of other transcription factors , such as c-Jun , CREB , and NF-IL6 , which are at the end of the specialized signal transduction pathways that are important in regulation of cell growth and differentiation .
Further study of C/EBP -£ and its partners may yield important new information about the regulatory mechanism that couples the simultaneous processes of proliferation and myeloid-cell differentiation .
