8 Precise Alignment of Sites Required for .
Enhancer Activation in B Cells BARBARA S. NIKOLAJCZYK , BARBARA NELSEN , anp RANJAN SEN®* Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center and Department of Biology , Brandeis University , Waltham , Massachusetts 02254-9110 Received 29 November 1995/Returned for modification 9 January 1996/Accepted 3 May 1996 The lymphocyte-specific immunoglobulin p heavy-chain gene intronic enhancer is regulated by multiple nuclear factors .
The previously defined minimal enhancer containing the pA , E3 , and pB sites is transac-tivated by a combination of the ETS-domain proteins PU.1 and Ets-1 in nonlymphoid cells .
The core GGAAs of the pA and pB sites are separated by 30 nucleotides , suggesting that ETS proteins bind to these sites from these same side of the DNA helix .
We tested the necessity for appropriate spatial alignment of these elements by using mutated enhancers with altered spacings .
A 4- or 10-bp insertion between pE3 and pB inactivated the j enhancer in $ 194 plasma cells but did not affect in vitro binding of Ets-1 , PU.1 , or the mE3-binding protein TFE3 , alone or in pairwise combinations .
Circular permutation and phasing analyses demonstrated that PU.1 binding but not TFE3 or Ets-1 bends pu enhancer DNA toward the major groove .
We propose that the requirement for precise spacing of the pA and B elements is due in part to a directed DNA bend induced by PU.1 .
A key molecular event in B-cell development is the activation of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) .
heavy-chain ( ) gene rearrangements in the earliest discernible B-cell precursor .
Correlation of transcription activation with V ( D ) J recombination ( 1 , 5 ) implicated the p enhancer , located between the J ; , and C , , exons , as the probable regulatory target directing Ig heavy-chain gene recombination .
The involvement of the p enhancer in recombination and transcriptional activation was supported by the observation of sterile transcripts that initiated within the enhancer ( 31 ) and by the analysis of recombination substrates in cell lines ( 44 ) and transgenic mice ( 10 ) .
Furthermore , a role for this enhancer in regulating accessibility was suggested by the studies of Jenuwein et al .
( 23 ) , who showed that a transgenic p enhancer conferred access of bacterial RNA poly-merases to adjacent DNA .
Recently , genetic disruption of the p enhancer in mice ( 8 , 51 ) has directly demonstrated a role for this enhancer in Ig heavy-chain gene rearrangement .
The p enhancer contains binding sites for multiple nuclear factors ( 32 , 41 ) .
Three known elements , pA , 1B , and octamer , bind proteins with restricted tissue distribution .
In contrast , the majority of the factors that bind to the wE1 to wE5 sites in the p enhancer can be detected in extracts made from B cells as well as nonlymphoid cells .
These factors , including the EZA gene products , belong to the basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) family of transcription factors ( 37 ) and have been implicated in both positive and negative regulation of the enhancer .
For example , the E5 motif that acts as a positive element in B cells ( 46 ) also interacts with a ubiquitous leucine zipper protein , ZEB , that has been proposed as a negative regulator of the enhancer ( 12 ) .
Secondly , in BxT somatic cell hybrids , where Ig heavy-chain expression is extinguished , one of the targets of repression is the wE4 element of the p enhancer ( 52 ) .
Finally , a mutation of the E2A ( bHLH ) gene by homol-ogous recombination results in a developmental block of B-cell differentiation at a very early stage ( 2 , 61 ) .
Interestingly , the same phenotype is obtained by transgenic overexpression of * Corresponding author .

4544 Id-1 , a protein known to heterodimerize with E2A gene products and prevent DNA binding by these proteins ( 54 ) .
Overall , these experiments indicate a critical role for bHLH gene products in lymphocyte differentiation .
In this array of factor-binding sites , mutation of a single element typically does not result in significant reduction of enhancer activity in plasma cells ( 32 ) .
This has been interpreted to indicate that there is substantial redundancy built into the enhancer .
However , analysis of multiply mutated enhancers shows that elements that bind both the tissue-restricted and ubiquitous proteins are required for enhancer function .
How these two types of proteins collaborate to generate a functional enhancer is , at present , unknown .
To simplify further analysis of the p enhancer , we have previously identified a minimal enhancer that contains no redundant mo-tifs .
The minimal enhancer contains the pA and wB elements that bind ETS-domain proteins ( 42 ) , along with the E3 element that binds several factors belonging to the bHLH-zip family ( 3 , 4 , 7 , 16 , 48 , 49 ) .
The minimal enhancer is B-cell specific , and mutation of any one of the three sites significantly diminishes enhancer activity .
Interestingly , the minimal enhancer is also a composite of tissue-restricted and ubiquitous protein-binding sites , suggesting that its analysis will provide insights into the mechanism of activation of the full p enhancer .
Both mA and pB sites contain the consensus element ( GGA ) for binding members of the ETS-domain family of transcription factors ( 25 ) .
The ETS family member PU.1 , a hematopoietic cell-specific protein , binds to the pB site and activates the p enhancer weakly in nonlymphoid cells .
Similarly , Ets-1 , a more widely distributed protein , binds the pA site but alone does not activate the enhancer .
In contrast , coexpression of Ets-1 and PU.1 in nonlymphoid cells results in synergistic activation of a reporter gene regulated by the minimal p enhancer ( 42 ) .
Our current study addresses the mechanism underlying the transactivation of the p enhancer by Ets-1 and PU.1 .
Separation of the pA and wB sites by an integral number of helical turns of DNA suggested that the A- and uB-binding Vou .
16 , 1996 proteins interacted with the DNA from the same side of the helix .
We tested whether alignment of the pA and pB sites was required for enhancer activity by inserting nucleotides to alter the distance between them .
Although binding of one or more purified proteins to the enhancer was not weakened by the insertion mutations , alteration of the alignment between the cis elements inactivated the .
enhancer in fully differentiated B cells .
Circular permutation and phasing analyses demonstrated that PU.1 , but not TFE3 or Ets-1 , bends DNA and therefore may contribute structurally to the p enhancer multiprotein complex .
Overall , our results suggest that a stereospecific multiprotein enhancer complex activates the Ig p heavy-chain gene .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Expression and purification of recombinant proteins .
( i ) His.PU .
A 1.3-kb Pvull-EcoRI fragment containing the full-length murine PU.1 cDNA was treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase plus deoxynucleoside triphos-phates ( dNTPs ) and cloned into Xhol-digested , Klenow-treated pET14b plasmid ( Novagen ) .
( ii ) His.Ets .
The ETS domain of Ets-1 was isolated from a pEV3S subclone ( 92 ) .
The pEV3S subclone contained the ETS domain of Ets-1 amplified by PCR with the following primers : 5-CCT GGG CCC GGG GCC CTG GCT GGC TAC AC-3 ' ( 5 ' primer ) and 5 % -CG GAG TCG ACG CTC AGG GGT GTA TCC CAG CAG-3 ' ( 3 ' primer ) .
Ets-1/pEV3S was digested with BamHI and Xbal , treated with Klenow fragment , and cloned into BamHI-digested , Klenow treated pET For protein expression , the plasmids were transformed into the BL21 bacterial strain .
Protein production was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-B-p-thiogalacto-pyranoside ( IPTG ) , and His-tagged proteins were purified without denaturing agents as specified by the manufacturer protocol ( Novagen ) .
( iii ) GST-TFE3 and GST-TFE3S .
Bacterial expression vectors for GST-TFE3 and GST-TFE3S were kindly provided by Kathryn Calame , Columbia University , New York , N.Y. Glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins were purified as described previously ( 53 ) .
Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.4 mM for 3 to 5 h. After induction , the bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in NETN buffer ( 10 mM Tris-Cl [ pH 8.0 ] , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 ) .
Extracts were prepared by sonication ( three pulses for 10 s each ) at 0°C .
The insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation , and the fusion protein was purified from the supernatant by adsorption to glutathione-agarose .
Sonicated supernatant from 1 liter of bacteria was agitated with 1 ml of a 50 % slurry of glutathione beads for 1 to 2 h at 4°C .
The beads were washed three times with 25 to 30 ml cold NETN buffer .
Adsorbed proteins were eluted with NETN buffer plus 5 mM reduced glutathione .
Eluates ( 1 column volume ) were collected and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and the most highly concentrated fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D ( 20 mM N-2-hydroxy-ethylpiperazine-N ' -2-cthanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ; pH 7.9 ] , 100 mM KCI , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 20 % glycerol ) .
Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C .
EMSAs .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) probes were isolated as Pstl-BamHI fragments from murine a170 ( bp 381 to 433 in the system of Ephrussi et al .
[ 9 ] ) cloned into A56CAT .
After isolation from a 6 % acrylamide gel , fragments were phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase and [ y- '' '' P ] ATP .
EMSA reactions were carried out in a volume of 20 pl containing 10,000 cpm of probe , 2.5 mg of poly ( dI-dC ) + ( dI-dC ) , and 2.0 wl of 10 % lipage buffer ( 10 % lipage is 100 mM Tris [ pH 7.51 , 0.5 M NaCl , 100 mM B-mercaptocthanol , 10 mM EDTA , and 40 % glycerol ) .
For EMSA with two recombinant proteins , both proteins were added to the reaction simultaneously .
After a 10-min incubation at room temperature , the reaction products were electrophoresed through nondenaturing 4 % polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 % Tris-borate buffer ( 44 mM Tris borate , 44 mM boric acid , 2 mM EDTA ) .
The gels were dried and visualized on DuPont film with an intensifying screen .
Plasmids .
The +4 , +10 , and downstream +18 spacing mutations were made in the previously described M100 mutation ( 40 ) , which introduces a Seel site between E3 and wB .
For the +10 mutation , a Spel linker ( GGACTAGTCC ) was ligated into Scal-cut M100 DNA .
The +4 mutation was generated by digesting the +10 mutation with Spel followed by S1 nuclease treatment and religation .
For the +18 mutation , M100 was digested with BemHI and treated with Klenow fragment to produce blunt ends and then the Spel linker was ligated into this site .
The BemHI introduced by site-specific mutagenesis of the core 1 ( 24 ) site lies 3 ' of pB .
All spacing mutations were generated in the context of the 700-bp Xbal-EcoRI fragment of the p. enhancer .
For transfection analyses , ( 70 ) ; plasmids were generated from the mutated enhancers by isolating the AluI-AluI fragment encompassing nucleotides 385 to 455 ( numbering according to the system of Ephrussi et al .
[ 9 ] ) and cloning into w ENHANCER ACTIVATION REQUIRES SITE ALIGNMENT 4545 the vector A56 fos CAT ( 15 ) , which was cut with Sell and treated with Klenow fragment .
For the £170 plasmids , the Hinfl-Ddel enhancer fragments ( residues 346 to 518 [ 9 ] ) containing the mutations were treated with Klenow fragment and cloned into pBluescript SK+ cut with Hincll .
HindIII-Xhol fragments isolated from these clones were then ligated into A56 fos CAT cut with HindIII and Sef .
The orientation of the 170 fragments is such that the 5° HinfI end of the enhancer is adjacent to the minimal fos promoter .
All plasmids were purified with Qiagen 100 preparative columns and sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations and the orientations .
The orientations of the 70 dimers are as previously described by Nelsen et al .
( 42 ) .
Murine $ 194 plasma cells were transfected with 5 mg of plasmid by the DEAE-dextran method as previously described ( 17 ) and harvested 42 to 48 hs posttransfection .
Protein ( 5 to 10 pg ) was analyzed in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assays as previously described ( 39 ) , and the results were quantitated by phosphorimager analysis .
DNA-bending analysis .
All bend angles were estimated from equations cited by Thompson and Landy ( 56 ) as modified by Kerppola and Curran ( 26 ) .
The position of the center of the DNA bend in circular permutation analysis was determined as a function of distance ( in base pairs ) from the end of the probe to the center of the uB GGAA by the method of Fisher et al .
( 11 ) .
Identical results for the DNA bend center were obtained relative to the center of the wE3 CATGTG core-binding site .
For circular permutation analysis , the PsfI-BamHI Klenow-treated p. enhancer fragment ( bp 381 to 433 ) was cloned into the Klenow-treated Seil site of the pBend vector ( 29 ) .
Fragments were excised with M/ul , Spel , EcoRV , Nrul , or BamHI , dephosphorylated , and *°P labeled as described above for EMSA .
Alternatively , a simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) .PU oligonucleotide ( GAT CCC TCT GAA AGA GGA ACT TGG ) was cloned into pBend and circular permutation fragments were excised with Miul , Spel , EcoRV , Nrul , or Rsal .
EMSA analysis was performed as described above .
The DNA flexure angle was calculated by using the equation py ; /p ; = cos in which m , is the mobility of the protein-DNA complex with the bend at the middle and py ; is the mobility of the protein-DNA complex with the bend at the end .
u , , was determined from the EcoRV fragment for PU.1 or the Nrul fragment for TFE3S/USF .
py was determined from the BamHI fragment for all proteins binding the p. enhancer , but the Mil fragments represented py ; for the SV40.PU series .
A standard curve was generated by measuring mobilities of fragments containing two to seven A tracts located either in the middle ( 1 , , ) or at the end ( j ; ) of the DNA fragment .
The py , /ps ratio was plotted as a function of the poly ( A ) -tract-induced angle to derive the standard curve .
Calculated values agreed well with values obtained from the standard curve .
A coefficient , k , introduced by Kerppola and Curran ( 26 ) to account for gel and fragment size variables , was also calculated from these standard poly ( A ) -tract fragments by using the equation py/ ; = cos ( k « /2 ) .
For this calculation , it was assumed that each poly ( A ) tract bent the DNA to an 18° angle ( 56 ) such that for the fragment with two poly ( A ) tracts , a = 36° , etc .
The coefficient k ( 0.67 ) was used for quantitation of phasing analyses .
Probes for phasing analysis contained the Pvell-BamHI ( bp 385 to 433 ) enhancer fragment , which was treated with Klenow or mung bean nuclease prior to ligation with the vector .
Vectors were derived from pTK401-26 or pTK401-28 ( 26 , 27 ) after excision of the AP-1 site with Xbel and Sell and subsequent treatment with Klenow fragment and deoxynucleotides .
Various combinations of fragments and vectors resulted in constructs containing 29 , 34 , 36 , 39 , or 41 bp between the centers of the mB site ( between the C and A of the sequence 5-TTCCCCAAA-3 ' ) and the minor-groove bending A tracts .
This distance was designated the spacer ; spacer length differed depending on the protein-binding site , with mB spacers being the shortest and mA spacers being the longest .
Phasing analysis was quantitated from the best cosine curve fit to the EMSA phasing data .
EMSA data were first expressed as complex mobility/mean mobility for all five phasing complexes and then plotted as a function of the number of base pairs between the middle of the protein-binding site and the middle of the 3 ' phased A tracts by using KaleidaGraph .
The fit of the cosine curve to the datum points was statistically significant ( chi-square values , < 0.005 ; R values , > 0.98 ) .
The horizontal phase shift was subtracted from the spacer length to center the function near the y axis .
This adjustment allowed determination of bend direction as described in Results .
The amplitude of the cosine function is equal to the phasing amplitude , Apy .
Apy used in conjunction with coefficient k and a standard bend angle ( « , ,4 ) of 54° ( for the three phased A tracts in the fragment ) defines the circular permutation angle ( ac , ) from the equation ( Ara/2 ) tan ( king/2 ) = taJIOiH—asm/Z ) RESULTS Our previous analysis suggested that the pA and pB sites are essential for activation of the murine p. heavy-chain gene enhancer ( 42 ) .
Examination of the corresponding regions of the Ig heavy-chain locus from other mammalian species showed 4546 NIKOLAJCZYK ET AL .

Comparison of mammalian p. enhancer sequences .
The human , rat , and rabbit enhancer sequences were obtained from Hayday et al .
( 20 ) , Brugge-mann et al .
( 6 ) , and Mage et al .
( 35 ) , respectively .
mA , E3 , and pB sites of the murine enhancer are indicated by brackets above the sequence .
Residues of the rat , human , and rabbit sequences that are identical to the murine sequence are indicated by dashes , and sequence differences shown as the altered base .
Residues that are common to all sequences are shown in boldface type in the murine sequence .
that both uA and pB sites were highly conserved ( 10-of-10-nucleotide identity at uA and 7-of-9-nucleotide identity at wB [ Fig .
1 ] ) .
The nonconserved nucleotides in pB are not critical for activation of the enhancer , as previously demonstrated ( 40 ) .
Mutation of the pA or wB elements abolishes the activity of the minimal enhancer , but residual activity of the uE3 site mutation suggests that this site contributes to enhancer activation quantitatively .
Interestingly , the spacing between the pA and mB motifs is evolutionarily conserved ; however , we found that the wE3 site defined in the murine enhancer was absent in the human and rabbit enhancers ( Fig .
1 ) .
Preservation of spacing even in the absence of a recognizable E box suggested that correct spatial orientation of these two sites was critical for enhancer function .
Effect of insertion mutations on p. enhancer-protein binding .
To test the hypothesis that the organization of the mA and pB sites and their cognate transcriptional activators was critical for enhancer activity in B cells , we constructed mutated p enhancers with either 4 or 10 bp inserted between the E3 and wB sites ( Fig .
2A ) and tested these mutations in DNA-binding and functional assays .
To facilitate DNA manipulations , insertions were made in the M100 .
enhancer mutation , in which the AGG between E3 and wB is changed to GTA to form a Scal restriction endonuclease site .
The M100 mutation does not affect u enhancer activation in B cells ( 40 ) , indicating that these changes do not alter functionally important sequences .
Insertion of 4 or 10 bp rotates the wB site approximately 145° or 350° , respectively , relative to the mA or E3 sites , assuming a DNA helical periodicity of 10.5 bp .
To eliminate the possibility that insertion of nucleotides between E3 and wB interferes with known protein-p enhancer interactions , we analyzed the binding of recombinant Ets-1 , PU.1 , or the prototypic bHLH-zip protein , TFE3 , to the mutant enhancer sequences by EMSA .
Full-length Ets-1 contains two inhibitory domains , positioned immediately 5 ' or 3 ' to the ETS domain , that interfere with DNA-binding activity ( 18 , 33 , 43 , 58 ) ; therefore , the DNA-binding ETS domain of Ets-1 [ amino acids 325 to 426 ; referred to as ETS ( Ets-1 ) ] was used in these assays in lieu of the full-length protein .
Increasing amounts of ETS ( Ets-1 ) were added to DNA probes derived from the M100 , +4 , or +10 mutated .
enhancers ( Fig .
2B ) .
No difference in complex formation ( E ) was seen with these three probes ( Fig .
2B , M100 [ lanes 1 to 4 ] , +4 [ lanes 5 to 8 ] , and +10 [ lanes 9 to 12 ] ) .
Similarly , addition of increasing amounts of TFE3 to M100 or the insertion mutations resulted in similar patterns of protein-DNA complexes with any of the three fragments ( Fig .
2C ; compare lanes 1 to 4 with lanes 5 to 8 and lanes 9 to 12 ) .
Mobility shift assays of PU.1 with p enhancer DNA resulted in a more complex pattern .
At low protein concentrations , PU.1 formed a single major nucleoprotein complex with the M100 probe ( P ; Fig .
2D , lane 1 ) whereas additional , more slowly migrating complexes appeared at Mor .

BioL .
higher protein concentrations ( ZP ; lanes 2 to 4 ) .
The major complex represents PU.1 bound to the wB site , as confirmed by its absence when a uB - probe was used in these assays ( data not shown ) , whereas the more slowly migrating complex probably represents occupancy of both mA and pB sites by PU.1 .
The proposed composition of the second complex ( ZP ) was confirmed by EMSA results with a pA mutated enhancer fragment ( uA~ ) , which formed only the complex even at high PU.1 concentrations ( lanes 13 to 16 ) .
DNase I footprint analysis confirmed that PU.1 was bound to both mB and pA sites at high protein concentrations ( data not shown ) .
We hypothesize that the main recognition of the p. enhancer by PU.1 occurs via the mB element , and pB binding is followed by recruitment of another molecule of PU.1 to the mA site .
A similar pattern of PU.1 binding was observed with the +4 and +10 nucleotide insertion mutation enhancers in both EMSA ( Fig .
2D , lanes 5 to 12 ) and DNase I footprint analyses ( data not shown ) .
We conclude that the spacing mutations do not affect the binding of Ets-1 , TFE3 , or PU.1 to p enhancer DNA .
Effect of insertion mutations on ( p70 ) ; and 1.170 enhancer activation .
To determine the effect of the insertion mutations on p enhancer function , we tested the mutants for activity in $ 194 plasma cells by transient-transfection analyses ( Fig .
3 ) .
As noted previously ( 42 ) , the minimal enhancer , 70 , was analyzed as a dimer to amplify small differences .
The M100 ( 70 ) , -containing reporter plasmid was as active as the wild-type ( 70 ) ; reporter in $ 194 cells ( data not shown ) .
Insertion of 4 or 10 nucleotides between the wE3 and pB sites dramatically decreased the activity of M100 ( 70 ) , derivatives ( la-beled M100 [ +4 ] and M100 [ +10 ] ) to 13 or 14 % of M100 activation , respectively ( Fig .
3A ) .
To rule out the possibility that the observed results were due to alteration of the spacing between the two 170 fragments , we analyzed a minimal enhancer that contained 18 nucleotides introduced 3 ' of the wB site ( M100 [ +18 ] ) .
This enhancer was significantly more active than either the +4 or +10 enhancers , supporting the view that alteration of spacing between 70 monomers or between the enhancer and promoter was not detrimental to enhancer activity .
Because the minimal enhancer is critically dependent on the integrity of all three motifs , the M100 ( 70 ) , dimer experiments did not distinguish whether the observed effects were due to disruption of wA/pB-binding protein interactions or to disruption of E3/uB-binding protein interactions .
In a larger enhancer fragment , such as the p170 which contains E1 , E2 , E3 , and E5 motifs , enhancer activity is much less dependent on the E3 element .
However , mutation of either pA or wB elements in this context abolishes enhancer function ( 42 ) .
We reasoned that if the spacing mutations affected only wE3/uB-binding protein interactions , the effect of these mutations in the context of 170 should be similar to that of a wE3~ mu-tation .
Alternatively , if wA/pB interactions were affected , the spacing mutant activity should resemble the activity of uA or B- enhancers .
We tested the effects of insertions in the context of the 170 enhancer by transient transfection of $ 194 cells ( Fig .
3B ) .
Addition of 4 bp between uE3 and wB decreased enhancer activity by 75 % , and insertion of 10 bp resulted in a 90 % reduction in transcriptional activation .
The activity of the spacing mutants was therefore comparable to that of the wA~ and B- mutant 170 enhancers .
In contrast , the uE3 mutation did not reduce p170-activated CAT expression significantly .
Because the spacing mutations were functionally similar to the pA~ or B- mutations and unlike the wE3~ mutation , we propose that the observed effects are due to disruption of appropriate spacing between the uA and B Vou .

Binding analysis of mutant enhancers that alter the distance between mB and the 5 ' pA or E3 elements .
( A ) w enhancer spacing mutants were made in the context of the functionally active M100 mutation as described in Materials and Methods .
The mA and B sites are shown as single-headed arrows , and the intervening E3 element is shown as a double-headed arrow to indicate its partially palindromic nature .
As a control , Spel linkers were also used to introduce the same nucleotides 3 ' of the uA/pE3/uB functional region at a unique BamHI site engineered into the first core homology .
70 constructs contained a single linker ( 18 additional nucleotides ) at the BamHI site ( M100 Bam| [ +18 ] ) , whereas 1170 constructs contained two linkers and ( 25 additional nucleotides ; M100 Bam { [ +25 ] ) at this site .
Four ( GGCC ) or 10 ( GGACTAGTCC ) nucleotides were inserted between E3 and B as indicated .
( B to D ) EMSA analysis of protein binding to the spacing mutant enhancers .
Increasing amounts of ETS-domain proteins or TFE3 were incubated with probes derived from M100 or mutant enhancers as indicated , followed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis .
Proteins used were the ETS domain of Ets-1 , ETS ( Ets-1 ) ( B ) , the protein TFE3 ( C ) , and PU.1 ( D ) .
The proposed single- and double-occupancy PU.1 complexes are indicated as P and 2P , respectively .
A~ refers to a probe containing a mutation in the A element .
elements .
We conclude that p. enhancer activity depends upon strict alignment of the mA and wB elements .
Binding of multiple proteins to the p. enhancer is not affected by the insertion mutations .
The EMSA analyses shown in Fig .
2 indicated that binding of individual enhancer proteins is not affected by the spacing alterations .
One mechanism by which insertion mutations may decrease p enhancer activation is by affecting the formation of an appropriate multiprotein complex on the DNA .
To examine potential perturbations in the formation of such a complex , we tested simultaneous binding of PU.1 , Ets-1 , and TFE3 in pairwise combinations ( Fig .
4 ) .
Incubation of constant amounts of wA-binding ETS ( Ets-1 ) with increasing amounts of wB-binding PU.1 demonstrated that the M100 , +4 , and +10 insertion mutants bound these proteins with indistinguishable affinities ( Fig .
4A , compare M100 [ lanes 1 to 4 ] , +4 [ lanes 5 to 8 ] , and +10 [ lanes 9 to 12 ] ) .
The complex representing the PU.1/ETS ( Ets-1 ) double occupancy ( P/E ) was seen at lower concentrations of PU.1 compared with the PU.1 double-occupancy band ( 2P ) .
These results show that Ets-1 binding to the PU.1-occupied p. enhancer is preferred over binding of a second molecule of PU.1 to the pA site .
Similar results were obtained in experiments with constant amounts of PU.1 and increasing concentrations of ETS ( Ets-1 ) or full-length Ets-1 ( data not shown ) .
EMSA with full length Ets-1 and PU.1 also showed no differences in ETS protein binding to the M100 or spacing mutants ( data not shown ) .
Overall , simultaneous binding of PU.1 and Ets-1 was not affected by the functionally inactive +4- or +10-bp enhancer mutants .

Functional analysis of spacing-mutant p. enhancer constructs .
M100 and spacing mutants were analyzed in the context of the 70 minimal enhancer ( A ) , or the larger p.170 enhancer ( B ) by transient transfections into $ 194 plasmacytoma cells .

binding of PU.1 and TFE3 , we used a splice variant of TFE3 ( TFE3S ) ( 47 ) and PU.1 in EMSA .
TFE3S retains the DNA-binding properties of TFE3 but results in a clearer , more easily interpreted pattern in EMSA .
In these experiments , the amount of TFE3S was held constant while the concentration of PU.1 was increased .
Consistent with the previous analyses of full-length TFE3 ( Fig .
2C ) , the binding of TFE3S alone to the M100 , +4 , or +10 mutations was unchanged ( Fig .
4B , lane 1 , 6 , and 11 ) .
TFE3S plus low concentrations of PU.1 formed one novel slowly migrating complex ( P/T , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
At higher concentrations of PU.1 , an additional complex , 2P/T , was formed ( lanes 4 and 5 ) .
We hypothesize that the initial complex ( P/T ) represents PU.1 and TFE3S binding to the wB and wE3 sites , respectively ; the most slowly migrating complex , 2P/T , represents PU.1 occupying both mA and pB in addition to TFE3S binding E3 .
Similar patterns of complexes were generated on the +4 and +10 spacing mutations ( +4 [ lanes 6 to 10 ] , +10 [ lanes 11 to 15 ] ) .
Interestingly , the initial ( P/T ) complex formed by PU.1 and TFE3S on the +4 enhancer DNA migrated faster than the P/T complexes formed on either the M100 or +10 enhancers .
This difference was not seen in complexes containing TFE3S alone .
We hypothesize that this altered mobility may be due to differences in DNA conformation induced by the binding of TFE3 and PU.1 .
TFE3 has been proposed to bend DNA ( 11 , 48 ) , but the DNA-bending properties of PU.1 are unknown .
Because the TFE3-binding site in the +4 mutant is rotated with respect to the wB site by half a helical turn compared with both the M100 and +10 mutants , we suggest that the bends induced by each protein may neutralize each other and thereby result in the observed differences in electrophoretic migration .
We did not examine Ets-1/TFE3 pairwise interactions , because the spacing mutants do not change the relative configuration of the pA and E3 sites .
Overall , both single and multiple protein-DNA binding assays demonstrated no significant difference in binding of Ets-1 , TFE3 , and/or PU.1 on M100 versus the insertion mutant enhancers .
Therefore , these binding analyses with purified proteins do not provide a simple mechanism for the inactivation of the enhancer by the +4 or +10 mutations .
p. enhancer DNA flexure is increased by protein binding .
The DNA-bending model proposed as the basis for the differential migration of P/T complexes formed on the M100 and +4 mutants was further analyzed by two methods : circular permutation and phasing analyses .
For circular permutation analysis , the minimal p. enhancer was inserted between tandemly repeated restriction sites of the pBend vector ( 29 ) .
Digestion of the resultant plasmid with various endonucleases yielded fragments of identical size , with the minimal enhancer located at different positions ( Fig .
SA ) .
Circular permutation analysis detects alterations in protein-DNA complex mobilities that reflect changes in end-to-end DNA distance resulting from ( i ) protein-induced DNA structural changes and ( ii ) the changing position of the protein-binding element within the probe .
The shorter end-to-end distance of a DNA molecule bent at its center is detected by a retardation of that molecule ( probe 3 ) compared with a DNA molecule bent at one end ( probe 5 ) .
Circular permutation analysis of PU.1 binding to the minimal enhancer demonstrated PU.1-induced changes in DNA flexure ( Fig .
5B , lanes 1 to 5 ) .
Calculation of the bend angle indicated that PU.1 binding the wB site bent enhancer DNA by approximately 48° .
Similar analysis of TFE3S ( Fig .
5B , lanes 6 to 10 ) demonstrated that this bHLH-zip protein bent the p enhancer by 40° .
Interestingly , a second bHLH-zip protein , USF , induced a 60° DNA bend when bound to the E3 site , suggesting that the extent of DNA bending was not determined solely by the DNA sequence ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether PU.1-induced increase in p enhancer flexure is a property of the ETS domain of PU.1 specifically or Vou .

Coordinate binding of two proteins to the p. enhancer spacing mutants .
( A ) Binding of the ETS domain of Ets-1 , ETS ( Ets-1 ) , to the M100 ( lanes 1 to 4 ) , +4 ( lanes 5 to 8 ) , or +10 ( lanes 9 to 12 ) mutant jw enhancers in the presence of increasing amounts of PU.1 .
ETS ( Ets-1 ) bound to the mA site is designated complex E , with P and 2P indicating single and double occupancy , respectively , of the B ( and mA ) sites by PU.1 as described in Fig .
2D .
The ternary complex containing ETS ( Ets-1 ) , PU.1 , and the p. enhancer is labeled P/E .
( B ) Binding of TFE3 ( TFE3S ) alone ( lanes 1 , 6 , and 11 ) or with increasing amounts of PU.1 on the M100 ( lanes 1 to 5 ) , +4 ( lanes 6 to 10 ) , or +10 ( lanes 11 to 15 ) mutant p enhancers .
Formation of single- and double-occupancy PU.1 complexes are designated P and 2P , respectively .
The ternary PU.1-TFE3-u enhancer complex is labeled P/T , and the quaternary 2PU.1-TFE3-p enhancer complex is marked 2P/T .
A splice variant of TFE3 which contains an intact bHLH-zip DNA-binding domain was used in these assays .
a general property of ETS domains , we repeated circular permutation analyses with the ETS domain of PU.1 [ ETS ( PU.1 ) ] and ETS ( Ets-1 ) ( Fig .
5C ) .
ETS ( PU.1 ) -DNA complexes showed variable mobility with probes 1 to 5 , as seen for the full-length PU.1 protein ( Fig .
5C , lanes 1 to 5 ) .
However , all complexes with the ETS domain of Ets-1 migrated at approximately the same position , indicating that ETS ( Ets-1 ) did not induce a conformational change in the DNA ( Fig .
5C , lanes 6 to 10 ) .
To further confirm that PU.1-induced flexure change was not determined by the sequence of the mB element , we analyzed a different PU.1-binding site .
Circular permutation analysis indicated that ETS ( PU.1 ) bent DNA containing the w ENHANCER ACTIVATION REQUIRES SITE ALIGNMENT 4549 SV40-PU.1 site to an apparent angle of 40° ( data not shown ) , suggesting that bending was determined by the ETS domain of PU.1 rather than by the corresponding DNA element .
Circular permutation results were further analyzed to determine the center of the protein-induced DNA bend ( Fig .
5D ) .
Although this analysis can not precisely localize the bend cen-ter , our results show that the PU.1-induced bend lies within the B element ( TTTGGGGAA ) .
The TFE3-induced bend center is located a few nucleotides 5 ' from the core CATGTG of the bHLH-zip binding site , E3 .
We conclude that two of the three proteins that bind to the minimal p enhancer induce conformational changes in the DNA .
Only PU.1 induces a directed bend in p. enhancer DNA .
Although circular permutation analysis provides evidence for protein-induced DNA distortion , this assay more accurately reflects changes in DNA flexure that result from protein-DNA interactions .
Alternatively , anomalous migrations in circular permutation assays may result from the nonglobular conformations of some DNA-binding proteins ( 26 ) .
To distinguish between DNA distortion and directed DNA bending , we performed phasing analysis .
For phasing analysis , the p. enhancer fragment was cloned adjacent to three poly ( A ) tracts ( 26 , 27 ) .
Each poly ( A ) tract confers an intrinsic DNA bend of 18° , for an overall 54° minor-groove-directed DNA bend .
This bend serves as an internal standard against which protein-induced bending in the adjacent DNA fragment can be compared .
The p enhancer was cloned at five different distances from the poly ( A ) tracts to position it at various helical positions relative to the intrinsic minor-groove bend ( Fig .
6A ) .
Protein-induced bends directed toward the minor groove reinforce the intrinsic poly ( A ) tract bend when the protein-binding site is positioned at integral ( n ) helical turns from the poly ( A ) tracts .
In contrast , major-groove bends reinforce the intrinsic bend when the protein-binding site is positioned on the opposite helical face ( n + 5 ) .
If a DNA-binding protein induces only a change in flexure , the location of the binding site with respect to the poly ( A ) tracts does not affect DNA bending as assayed by nucleoprotein complex migration .
EMSA analysis demonstrates bend reinforcement as decreased mobility of the DNA-protein complex .
We performed phasing analysis with ETS ( PU.1 ) , ETS ( Ets-1 ) , and TFE3S ( Fig .
6B ) .
Differences in protein-DNA complex mobility were apparent for ETS ( PU.1 ) ( lanes 1 to 5 ) but not ETS ( Ets-1 ) ( lanes 6 to 10 ) or TFE3S ( lanes 11 to 15 ) , indicating that only ETS ( PU.1 ) induced a directed DNA bend .
Results similar to ETS ( PU.1 ) results were obtained for full-length PU.1 ( data not shown ) .
The PU.1-DNA complex was specifically inhibited by the p. enhancer phasing plasmid but not an AP-1 site-containing plasmid , indicating that PU.1 binds only u enhancer elements in the phasing fragments ( data not shown ) .
Phasing analysis further allowed us to calculate the degree of ETS ( PU.1 ) -induced DNA bending as described in Materials and Methods .
The best-fit cosine curve for ETS ( PU.1 ) ( Fig .
7A ) indicated a bend angle of 24° , after correction for the slight bend ( 1.0° ) contributed by the DNA probe alone ( Fig .
7B ) .
The direction of the ETS ( PU.1 ) -induced DNA bend can also be ascertained from the phasing analysis once the center of the bend has been determined .
Although circular permutation results indicated that the center of the ETS ( PU.1 ) -induced flexure lies within the mB element , the precise bend center of this nonpalindromic site could not be determined .
However , PU.1 binding to the pB site induces a strong DNase I-hypersensitive site in the noncoding strand between the C and A residues , suggesting the presence of protein-induced distortion of the phosphodiester backbone 4550 NIKOLAJCZYK ET AL .

Circular permutation of PU.1 binding to the p. enhancer .
( A ) Probes used in circular permutation assays .
Fragments 1 to 5 containing pA , E3 , and mB were excised from the pBend vector with the designated enzymes .
The wB site is located closest to the end of the fragment in probe 5 and closest to the middle of the fragment in probe 3 .
( B and C ) Circular permutation analysis .
Probes 1 to 5 were incubated with PU.1 ( B ) , TFE3S ( B ) , the ETS domain of PU.1 ( C ) , or the ETS domain of Ets-1 ( C ) and assayed by electrophoresis through nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels .
( D ) Determination of the bend center for PU.1 and TFE3S .
The mobilities of the protein-DNA complexes generated with the circular permutation probes were plotted as a function of the distance between the core GGAA of the wB and the 5 ' end of each probe .
( 45a ) .
We approximated the hypersensitive site as the center of the PU.1-induced DNA bend and calculated the spacer lengths between pB and the poly ( A ) tract bend centers with reference to the position of this site .
The ETS ( PU.1 ) -induced DNA bend reinforced the poly ( A ) tract bend , resulting in the lowest-mo-bility nucleoprotein complex when the wB site was positioned 36 bp ( 3.4 helical turns ) from the poly ( A ) tract .
Because ETS ( PU.1 ) reinforced the minor-groove-directed poly ( A ) tract bend when the mB element was on the opposite side of the DNA helix , we propose that ETS ( PU.1 ) bends m enhancer DNA toward the major groove .
Surprisingly , TFE3S did not induce a significant directed DNA bend ( < 1° ) as measured by phasing analysis ( Fig .
6B ; cosine curve not shown ) , despite a greater than 40° change in flexure calculated from the circular permutation studies .
This result conflicts with earlier reports ( 11 , 48 ) of DNA bending by bHLH-zip proteins .
We surmise that a significant proportion of the TFE3-induced conformational change may be attributed to a change in DNA flexure .
Alternatively , it is possible that sequences flanking the bHLH-zip recognition element determine the extent of the protein-induced bend .
DISCUSSION To facilitate mechanistic analysis of the lymphoid cell-specific immunoglobulin p heavy-chain gene enhancer , we previously described a minimal enhancer that contains three sequence elements : pA , wE3 , and wB ( 42 ) .
In this study , we demonstrate that appropriate spatial organization of the pA and pB sites is required for u enhancer activity in B cells .
In vitro analysis of purified Ets-1 , TFE3 , and PU.1 proteins that bind to the pA , uE3 , and B sites , respectively , showed that PU.1 but neither Ets-1 nor TFE3 induced a directed bend of approximately 24° in the enhancer DNA .

Phasing analysis of p. enhancer-binding proteins .
( A ) DNA fragments used in the phasing analysis .
The 55-bp enhancer fragment was inserted 5 ' to three poly ( A ) tracts in previously described vectors ( 29 , 30 ) .
Spacing between the w enhancer and poly ( A ) tracts was varied to orient j. enhancer elements at different positions of the DNA helix with respect to the poly ( A ) tracts .
The number of base pairs between the center of the core GGAA of B and the center of the poly ( A ) tracts is indicated .
This spacer length varied for pB , pA or E3 elements as noted in panel B .
( B ) EMSA with DNA-phasing probes .
Phasing probes were incubated with ETS ( PU.1 ) ( spacer length 29 to 41 ) , ETS ( Ets-1 ) ( spacer length 58 to 70 ) , or TFE3S ( spacer length 45 to 57 ) and then analyzed by electrophoresis through 20-cm 4 % acrylamide gels .
The migration of each complex in EMSA reflects the net bend of the poly ( A ) tracts plus the protein-induced bend .
PU.1-induced bend in the DNA facilitates the formation of a functional multiprotein complex on the p. enhancer .
The importance of rotational alignment of cis-acting regulatory elements has been investigated in several systems .
Most of these studies have focused on promoters and found that appropriate helical phasing is required for optimal activity , for example , the serine protease B gene , the araBAD operon , and the HLA-DR gene ( 19 , 30 , 57 ) .
In addition , helical periodicity has been observed for the interaction between the promoter and enhancer of simian virus 40 and human immunodeficiency virus ( 45 , 55 ) .
A functional role for strict stereochemical relationship between motifs within an enhancer has been harder to demonstrate , perhaps because of the complex organization of w ENHANCER ACTIVATION REQUIRES SITE ALIGNMENT 4551 enhancers .
Several earlier studies have addressed this question as summarized below .
In the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) « -chain gene enhancer , a requirement for appropriate orientation of the Tal and Ta2 domains was suggested by altering the spacing between these elements .
Functional assays indicated that for enhancer activation , Tal and Ta2 elements must be separated by more than 23 bp but less than 93 bp , without a strict dependence on the helical phasing between the two sites ( 22 ) .
A more recent analysis of the TCR « enhancer ( 14 ) showed that introduction of 4 nucleotides between the ATF/CREB and LEF/PEBP2/ Ets-1 sites reduced enhancer activity ; activity was restored by increasing the spacing to 10 nucleotides .
These results indicate that optimal interaction between proteins bound at the ATF/ CREB site and at one or more of the other sites requires appropriate helical phasing .
Schanke and VanNess ( 50 ) showed that large changes in the positions of the kB and E2 elements in the Ig x light-chain enhancer resulted in loss of enhancer activity whereas small changes in their relative positions did not .
These results indicated that the x intron enhancer does not have strict spacing requirements .
Finally , a close juxtaposition of core-binding factor sites to other sites has been noted in the TCR B- and 8-chain gene enhancers ( 21 , 60 ) .
Specifically , cooperative binding of Ets-1 and core-binding factor to the TCR B enhancer was shown to be independent of the distance between the two sites ; however , the effects of moving the sites apart in transcriptional activation studies have not yet been determined .
In contrast , transcriptional activity of the 30-bp 3E3 element was abrogated by moving the binding sites for c-myb and core-binding factor by either 5 or 10 bp .
We found that introduction of 4 or 10 nucleotides between the uA/uE3 elements and the pB element essentially abolished the activity of both the p70 minimal enhancer and the larger 170 enhancer in B cells .
Because mutation of the E3 element did not affect 170 enhancer activity , we propose that the insertion mutations inactivate the p. enhancer by disrupting interactions between ETS-domain proteins bound to the pA and pB sites .
Such interactions may create a hybrid transactivation domain formed by ETS proteins bound to both sites , which could activate transcription by directly interacting with the basal transcription machinery .
Alternatively , a third coac-tivator molecule may be recruited to the u enhancer complex via interactions with appropriately positioned puA- and wB-binding proteins .
Although synergistic interactions between cis elements is often reflected in cooperative DNA binding by the respective trans-acting factors , we did not detect cooperative binding of PU.1 and Ets-1 to m enhancer DNA .
Because the experiments were performed with bacterially expressed proteins , we can not rule out the possibility that B-cell-specific posttranslational modifications are necessary to observe such effects or that PU.1 or Ets-1 functions with other ETS-domain genes expressed in B cells .
Alternatively , our observations may reflect potential synergistic interactions between transcription factors at a level other than DNA binding .
A functional role for protein-induced DNA bends has been postulated for several transcription factors , such as catabolite activator protein ( 62 ) , LEF-1 ( 13 ) , retinoic acid receptors ( 34 , 36 ) , YY-1 ( 38 ) and the fos/jun protein family ( 26 , 27 ) .
We found that of the three factors required to activate the minimal p enhancer , only PU.1 induced a directed bend in the DNA as assayed by circular permutation and phasing analyses .
It is interesting that binding of the related Ets-1 protein does not bend DNA , even though the DNA contacts previously defined for Ets-1 interaction with its cognate site ( 43 ) are very similar to those made by PU.1 at the pB site ( 45a ) .

Quantitation of directed DNA bend angles .
( A ) The migration of individual DNA-PU.1 complexes normalized to the average migration of all five complexes was plotted as a function of the distance between the center GGAA of mB and the center of the poly ( A ) tracts .
Data from three experiments are shown , with some points being superimposed .
The best-fit cosine function for the combined data was obtained by using KaliedaGraph .
The resulting curve demonstrates a periodicity of about 10.5 bp , as expected for B-DNA .
After subtraction of the horizontal phase shift , the maxima of the curve are at approximately 0 and 10 bp and the minimum of the curve lies at 5 bp .
ETS ( PU.1 ) therefore bends DNA toward the major groove .
( B ) The best-fit cosine function for the migration of DNA phasing probes alone ( n = 3 ) demonstrates an insignificant ( < 1.0° ) intrinsic bend in the 1 enhancer DNA phasing probes .
suggest that ETS proteins may differ in their ability to induce DNA conformational changes .
We speculate that DNA-bending properties may determine , in part , functional differences between ETS family members , as previously proposed for bZip family proteins ( 26-28 ) .
Because both ETS-1 and PU.1 proteins recognize their sites via the major groove , we suggest that PU.1-induced bending serves to align the two proteins bound to the uA and pB sites ( Fig .
8 ) .
Recently , Werner et al .
( 59 ) described a high-resolution structure of the ETS domain of Ets-1 bound to its recognition site .
They found that DNA binding by ETS ( Ets-1 ) induced a sharp kink in the DNA as a result of local compression of the major groove and widening of the minor groove .
The distortion in the Ets-1/DNA complex is caused by intercalation of a tryptophan residue into the minor groove of the DNA between residues 6 and 7 of the Ets-1-binding site , 5 ! -TCGAGCCGG AAGTTCGA-3 ' .
In our interpretation of the PU.1 phasing data , we approximated the center of the bend to the site of a Ets-1 FIG .

Model for the functional multiprotein complex on the minimal p enhancer .
Ets-1 ( A-binding protein ) and PU.1 ( .B-binding protein ) are shown bound to the same side of p enhancer DNA , with the smaller circles representing the ETS domains and the larger circles representing the non-DNA-binding domains of each protein .
The DNA bend of approximately 24° is shown directed away from the PU.1 protein as discussed in the text .
Formation of the proposed PU.1/Ets-1 interface may be facilitated by the PU.1-induced DNA bend .
The bHLH-zip protein TFE3 ( j.E3-binding protein ) interacts with the DNA from the opposite side of the helix , with the protein located behind the plane of the paper .
strong PU.1-induced DNase I-hypersensitive site ( on the noncoding strand ) between residues 5 and 6 of the pB site , 5'-T ATTTGGGGAAGGGAA-3 ' .
The close correspondence between the positions of the PU.1-induced hypersensitive site and Ets-l-induced DNA kinking suggests that PU.1 binding may similarly distort the DNA helix at this position .
Furthermore , we have found that the three adenosine residues complementary to the three contiguous thymidines in the mB site score strongly in methylation interference assays ( 45a ) .
Since the methyl group of methyl adenosines falls in the minor groove , these observations suggest that PU.1 is located over the minor groove in the vicinity of the PU.1-induced bend .
Taken together with the phasing analysis that shows that the induced bend is towards the major groove , our observations are consistent with the DNA being bent away from the bound PU.1 protein .
This facet of PU.1-DNA interaction is also consistent with the proposed structure of the DNA complex ( 59 ) and highlights the similarity of DNA recognition by these distantly related ETS-domain proteins .
The proposed distortion of the DNA helix may facilitate interactions between the two proteins bound at the uA and pB sites of the u enhancer .
In contrast to the observations of Werner et al .
( 59 ) , we did not detect DNA bending by ETS ( Ets-1 ) in circular permutation or phasing assays .
One possibility for the difference in the results of the two studies is that DNA bending would be more evident with a full-length version of Ets-1 .
We consider this unlikely because in our assays DNA bending induced by the ETS domain of PU.1 was identical to that induced by the full-length protein .
Alternatively , it is possible that the sequence of the binding site per se contributes significantly to the extent of DNA bending by Ets-1 .
However , for PU.1 protein , the sequence of the site appears to play a lesser role , because both the B- and the substantially different SV40 PU.1-binding sites were bent to a similar extent upon binding this protein .
Lastly , the mobility shift analysis of DNA bending may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect the small ( 10° ) bend induced by the human Ets-1 DNA-binding domain ; it is also possible that the few differences between the murine and human Ets-1 proteins further reduces the bending propensity of murine Ets-1 .

16 , 1996 It is important to note that the stereospecifically precise complex generated on pA/uB is required for enhancer activity whether the E3 motif is being utilized ( as in the case of the p70 enhancer ) or not ( as in the case of the p170 E3 en-hancer ) .
Taken together , our data suggest that activation of the p. enhancer is driven by an ETS protein-containing nucleoprotein complex which serves as an enhancer core with the ability to utilize proximal p enhancer elements , such as E motifs , to activate transcription .
