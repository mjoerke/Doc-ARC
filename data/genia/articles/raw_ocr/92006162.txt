37/10 , 1715-1719 ( 1991 ) Glucocorticoid Receptors in Normal Leukocytes : Effects of Age , Gender , Season , and Plasma Cortisol Concentrations Hirotoshi Tanaka , '' Hideto Akama , Yoichi Ichikawa , Mitsuo Homma , and Hisaji Oshima ?
We measured glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) isolated from peripheral blood of 145 apparently healthy volunteers ( 86 men and 59 wom-en ) .
An age-related decrease in the number of GR was suggested between subjects younger than 20 years and elderly subjects ; there was no apparent seasonal variation in GR .
Gender difference in the number of GR was not significant , although women showed slightly fewer GR .
Eight patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis were examined to determine whether the number of GR in MNL could be down-regulated by their cognate ligands .
The number of GR in MNL from these patients was significantly decreased one month after the initiation of prednisolone therapy .
However , in normal subjects , the GR in MNL did not demonstrate circadian variation , in contrast to concentrations of plasma cortisol .
Additional Keyphrases : sex- and age-related effects - derma- tomyositis/polymyositis + prednisolone therapy Glucocorticoids exert numerous biological effects on various cellular and metabolic processes .
On entry into target cells , they interact with specific intracellular proteins , e.g. , glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) ; the GR then undergo a conformational change that enables a receptor to translocate to the nucleus and bind to specific acceptor sites of DNA .
The GR thereby modulate the expression of target genes in a tissue-specific manner , resulting in a cascade of biological events ( reviewed in 1 , 2 ) .
Abundant evidence has already been accumulated suggesting the importance of GR determination in assessing therapeutic responsiveness to glucocorticoids in patients with heterologous diseases and in healthy humans ( 3-9 ) .
However , it has become apparent that the relationship between the number of GR and glucocorticoid responsiveness is not always consistent , the reason for which is still unclear .
Moreover , as previously re-ported , the number of GR shows wide variation , attributable to differences in assay procedures or conditions ( 3-16 ) , which has made it extremely difficult to compare Department of Internal Medicine , School of Medicine , Keio University , Shinjuku-ku , Tokyo 160 , Japan .

Received February 19 , 1991 ; accepted August 9 , 1991. independently performed studies .
Taken together , contents of GR have been suggested to be critical in predicting the magnitude of hormone effects in various diseases , but that is not sufficiently proven yet , at least in part because of variation in the GR assay itself .
We have already established a simple whole-cell assay of GR in human mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) ( 9 ) and have shown that the number of GR in normal human MNL correlates to hormone responsiveness both in vivo ( 9 ) and in vitro ( Ia ) .
To further verify the importance of this assay procedure with regard to clinical application , we have studied a relatively large , apparently healthy population to examine age- or gender-related and seasonal and diurnal variations in the number of GR in normal human MNL .
Subjects and Sampling Subjects were 145 apparently healthy volunteers : 86 men , ages 18-79 years ( mean 24.2 , SD 35.1 ) , 59 women , ages 18-77 years ( mean 32.3 , SD 31.8 ) , and eight women with dermatomyositis/polymyositis , ages 19-36 years ( mean 23.5 , SD 11.1 ) .
Blood was drawn into heparinized tubes by antecu-bital venous puncture , generally at 0800 h after an overnight fast , with two consecutive blood samplings at 15-min intervals ( the volumes of blood drawn were 60 , 5 , and 5 mL , respectively ) .
MNL were isolated , without delay , from 55 mL of the initially collected blood sample and analyzed for GR .
Plasma was separated from 5 mL of each blood collection and stored at -80°C until determination of cortisol .
Materials and Methods Chemicals .
[ 6,7-°H ] Dexamethasone ( specific activity , 47.5 kCi/mol ) and [ 1,2- % HJcortisol ( 40 kCi/mol ) were purchased from New England Nuclear ( NEN ) Research Products , Boston , MA .
Unlabeled dexamethasone was from Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO .
Ficoll 400 was from Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden .
Hypaque was from Winthrop Labs. , New York , NY .
RPMI-1640 medium and fetal calf serum were from Gibco BRL Labs. , New York , NY .
Cell preparations .
Whole blood was fractionated by one-step gradient centrifugation with Ficoll ( 80.2 g/L ) -Hypaque ( 1.077 kg/L ) at 400 x g for 30 min at 20 °C .
The MNL-enriched interphase was washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline , pH 7.4 , then resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium and used as MNL in the present study .
Viability of cells exceeded 95 % during the experiments , as judged by trypan blue dye exclusion .
Whole-cell assay of GR .

10 , 1991 1715 determined essentially as described before ( 9 ) .
Briefly , 200 uL of suspension was added to all tubes , which had previously received 50 uL of RPMI-1640 medium containing [ °H } dexamethasone at final concentrations of 0.5 , 1 , 2.5 , 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 nmol/L , respectively , with or without a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled dexa-methasone .
All tubes were incubated at 37°C with gentle shaking for 2 h. Then , 200 uL of suspension was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube ( Microfuge* '' ; Beckman Instruments , Palo Alto , CA ) containing 150 uL of silicone oil cushion .
After centrifuging the sample at 10 000 x z for 45 s , we cut off the bottom tip of tube , which contained the cell pellet , and placed this in a scintillation counting vial .
The radioactivity of the pellet was counted in 10 mL of Aquasol ( NEN Research Products ) with a Beckman Model LS-9800 scintillation counter , which has an average efficiency of 40 % for tritium .
All determinations were performed in tripli-cate .
The apparent dissociation constant ( K , , ) and the number of specific binding sites ( R. , ... ) were determined by Scatchard analysis ( 17 ) .
Radioimmunoassay of plasma cortisol .
We measured cortisol in plasma in duplicate by radioimmunoassay ( 18 ) and then calculated the mean value .
The detection limit of the assay was 3 nmol/L .
The intra- and interas-say CVs were < 10 % and < 17 % , respectively ( 18 ) .
Statistical analysis .
Linear regression and correlation were calculated by the least-squares method .
For comparison of two variables , we used Student 's ¢-test , paired or unpaired where appropriate ( 19 ) .
Results are expressed as mean + SD unless otherwise specified .
Results Whole-cell assay for GR in normal human MNL .
R ... , and K , , were determined by Scatchard analysis , and individual R , , , , , results were used as the GR number of the corresponding subject .
In five subjects , GR determination was repeated five times in separate experiments , and the intra-assay CV was calculated for R , ,. , , and K , , respectively .
The CV for R. , , , ranged from 0.6 % to 26.1 % ( mean 9.8 % ) , and the CV for K , from 4.4 % to 39.2 % ( mean 15.9 % ) , as shown in Table 1 .
Effects of age , gender , and time of year on number of GR in MNL .
In 145 healthy subjects , the range of R ... , was 2.5-16.4 fmol/10° cells ( 8.5 + 2.5 , mean + SD ) , and K , was 2.2-15.8 nmol/L ( 6.8 + 2.3 ) .
When the GR Table 1 .
Precision of Whole-Cell Assay of number was determined , we plotted the individual GR number in MNL against age ( Figure 1 ) .
There was no significant correlation between GR number and age ( r = -0.122 ) .
However , when subjects were divided into four groups by age ( Table 2 ) , group B ( age > 20 and < 40 years ) showed fewer GR in MNL than did group A ( age < 20 : P < 0.05 ) .
Although not statistically significant , groups C ( age > 40 and < 60 ) and D ( age > 60 ) also showed relatively fewer GR than did group A .
Gender difference was unclear in the GR number in MNL ( Figure 2 ) .
The range of GR number in MNL in 86 men was 3.3-13.3 fmol/10® cells ( 8.7 + 2.8 ) , and in 59 women was 2.5-16.4 fmol/10° cells ( 8.1 + 3.0 ) .
Seasonal variation in the GR number in MNL is shown in Figure 3 .
There was no apparent relationship between the GR number in MNL and the month of the year when GR were determined .
Down-regulation of GR in MNL in patients undergoing prednisolone therapy .
To test whether our method for GR determination detected down-regulation of GR in MNL after exogenous administration of glucocorticoids , we studied eight women with dermatomyositis/polymy-ogitis .
Before administration of synthetic glucocorticoid prednisolone , the GR number in MNL ranged from 7.7 to 15.3 fmol/10® cells ( mean 10.7 , SD 2.2 ) .
Initial dosages of prednisolone varied from 40 to 60 mg/d ( mean 54.9 , SD 9.0 ) .
One month after initiation of the therapy , GR were determined again in MNL of the corresponding patients .
In seven of eight patients , the GR in MNL decreased , and the mean GR number in MNL ( 7.8 SD 154 .

Effects of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis on the GR number in MNL .
In 33 healthy subjects ( 22 men ) , we investigated the relationship between concentrations of GR in MNL and those of plasma cortisol measured in the morning .
The GR number in MNL did not show a significant relationship with morning cortisol concentrations ( Figure 5 ) .
Plasma cortisol concentrations are well known to show circadian variation-being relatively high in the morning and low in the evening ( 20 , 21 ) .
In 16 healthy subjects ( nine men ) , blood was drawn twice ( 0800 and 1800 h ) , followed by two additional blood samplings 15 min after each sampling .
MNL and plasma were then prepared and the GR in MNL were determined without delay .
Plasma cortisol was assayed in one experiment .
As shown in Figure 6a , concentrations of plasma cortisol in these subjects demonstrated apparent diurnal variation , varying from 537.6 nmol/L ( mean ) in the morning to 299.6 nmol/L in the evening .
In contrast , the GR did not show marked { m+sD 20r r -- P < 0.0 @ 0 -- Receptor Number ( f moles/10® cells ) o n t -- -f-4 -t- < n T R J .

Discussion Alterations in the adoptive responsiveness to hormones are age related , as are changes in the induction of many enzymes ( 22 ) .
Glucocorticoid hormone-mediated responses are controlled by binding to the GR , by activation of the hormone-receptor complex , and by translocation of these complexes to the nuclear acceptor sites ( 1 , 2 ) .
There have been various reports concerning age-dependent regulation of the GR in animal tissues ( 23-26 ) .
Currently , senescent rats are thought to show reduced binding capacity for glucocorticoids in spleen and liver ( 23-26 ) .
Because development and aging of animals may partly be characterized by changes in the responsiveness of tissues or cells to certain hormone modulators ( 22 ) , it is important to determine whether humans show quantitative changes in the concentra- CLINICAL CHEMISTRY , Vol .

Diurnal changes in concentrations GR number in normal human MNL ( b ) Vertical bar represents mean + SD of plasma cortisol ( a ) and tions of GR during aging .
In the present study , the relationship between age and the GR number in MNL was not significant , partly because of nonuniform distribution of the subjects by age .
However , younger subjects tended to have relatively more GR in MNL , as also reported for rats .
Plasma cortisol concentrations reportedly do not change considerably during aging ( 27 ) ; thus , developmental change in the GR number probably does not reciprocally complement the age-related changes in plasma cortisol concentrations , but may relate to some other aspects of human development and aging .
Gender differences in the distribution and regulation of GR have also been studied in rats ( 28 ) , but not in humans .
The GR number in the thymus and the liver are lower in female than in male rats ( 28 ) .
Humans show no significant gender difference in plasma cortisol concentrations ( 29 ) , and the present study also showed no marked difference by gender in the number of GR in MNL .
Ovariectomy increases GR concentrations in rats , presumably by abrogating agonistic activity of progesterone ( 28 ) .
Accordingly , to explain these differences between rats and humans , we must consider the possibility that plasma progesterone may also influence the GR number in women , thus masking actual gender difference in GR numbers ( 28 ) .
GR are down-regulated by their cognate ligands ( 10 , 30 , 31 ) .
We have shown that administration of prednisolone for one month decreased the GR number in MNL considerably , indicating the reciprocal relationship between the GR number in MNL and plasma concentrations of prednisolone .
However , morning concentrations of cortisol in plasma did not show any correlation with the GR number in MNL .
Moreover , we failed to demonstrate significant alterations in the GR number in MNL within a day , even though plasma cortisol showed circadian variation .
Pardes et al .
( 5 ) reported that urinary excretion of 170HCS , not plasma concentrations of morning cortisol , correlated with the GR number in MNL in patients with Cushing disease as determined by whole-cell assay .

( 11 ) reported 1718 CLINICAL CHEMISTRY , Vol .

10 , 1991 that cytosolic GR reflected the circadian variation of plasma cortisol , but that whole-cell receptors did not change markedly within a day .
Given these results , we suggest that physiological secretion of cortisol is hardly sufficient to affect the concentrations of GR within a day , in comparison with therapeutic concentrations of synthetic glucocorticoid prednisolone .
From a methodological viewpoint , cytosolic GR assay eliminates GR translocated into the nucleus , which are already exposed to and activated by cortisol , and may reflect the number of GR remaining in the cytosol .
By contrast , whole-cell GR assay principally detects all binding sites for glucocorticoids through ideally complete exchange of the ligands , whether the GR are in the cytosol or translocated after activation .
Taken together , cytosolic GR concentrations may represent the amount of ligand-free receptor , which promptly fluctuates after activation and translocation of the receptor .
On the other hand , concentrations of whole-cell GR may reflect the amount of available receptor protein , which is relatively constant within a day ( 32 ) .
We have recently suggested ( manuscript submitted ) that the GR number determined by whole-cell assay in MNL reflects individual responsiveness to glucocorticoids in vivo ( 9 ) and in vitro ( Ja ) in healthy humans .
Moreover , this GR-hormone response relationship is reported in various categories of diseases , in which the GR were determined by whole-cell assay ( 3-8 ) .
Thus , we conclude that individual responsiveness to glucocorticoids is reflected by the concentrations of whole-cell GR in MNL .
In summary , whole-cell assay of GR apparently is not affected by age , gender , season , or physiological secretion of cortisol , and is relevant in assessing the relationship between the GR number and clinical sensitivity to glucocorticoid therapy .
Clearly , for practical application , we should examine further the influence of diseases and concomitant administration of other therapeutic drugs on GR determination .
