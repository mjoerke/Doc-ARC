10 Transcriptional Repression of the Interleukin-2 Gene by Vitamin D ; : Direct Inhibition of NFATp/AP-1 Complex Formation by a Nuclear Hormone Receptor IRIS ALROY , TERRI L. TOWERS , anp LEONARD P. FREEDMAN®* Cell Biology and Genetics Program , Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Cornell University Graduate School of Medical Sciences , New York , New York 10021 Received 30 March 1995/Returned for modification 17 May 1995/Accepted 13 July 1995 T-lymphocyte proliferation is suppressed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , [ 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ] , the active metabolite of vitamin D ; , and is associated with a decrease in interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , gamma interferon , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA levels .
We report here that 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; , -mediated repression in Jurkat cells is cycloheximide resistant , suggesting that it is a direct transcriptional repressive effect on IL-2 expression by the vitamin D , receptor ( VDR ) .
We therefore examined vitamin D , -mediated repression of activated IL-2 expression by cotransfecting Jurkat cells with IL-2 promoter/reporter constructs and a VDR overexpression vector and by DNA binding .
We delineated an element conferring both DNA binding by the receptor in vitro and 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , -mediated repression in vivo to a short 40-bp region encompassing an important positive regulatory element , NF-AT-1 , which is bound by a T-cell-specific transcription factor , NFATp , as well as by AP-1 .
VDR DNA-binding mutants were unable to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo ; the VDR DNA-binding domain alone , however , bound the element but also could not repress IL-2 expression .
These results indicate that DNA binding by VDR is necessary but not sufficient to mediate IL-2 repression .
By combining partially purified proteins in vitro , we observed the loss of the bound NFAT 1-DNA complex upon inclusion of VDR or VDR-retinoid X receptor .
Order of addition and off-rate experiments indicate that the VDR-retinoid X receptor heterodimer blocks NFATp/AP-1 complex formation and then stably associates with the NF-AT-1 element .
This direct inhibition by a nuclear hormone receptor of transcriptional activators of the IL-2 gene may provide a mechanistic explanation of how vitamin derivatives can act as potent immunosuppressive agents .
1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D ; [ 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; ] , the active metabolite of vitamin D ; , is a seco-steroid hormone that binds with high affinity to a nuclear receptor , the vitamin D ; , receptor ( VDR ) .
This receptor selectively associates with recognition sequences in the promoter region of target genes , thereby regulating the transcription of those genes .
The principal functions of 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; are the stimulation of intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption , mediation of bone remodeling , and conservation of minerals in the kidney ( for reviews , see references 46 and 63 ) .
In addition to its action in these tissues , however , 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; has been found in skin , testes , breast , muscle , pan-creas , endocrine glands , thymus , and bone marrow , suggesting additional regulatory functions for the hormone .
Notably , 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; appears to play an important role in modulating the growth of cells of the immune system : the hormone can induce the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells along a monocyte/ macrophage lineage ( 1 , 4 , 6 , 49 ) and can inhibit T-lymphocyte proliferation and activation both in vivo and in vitro ( 8 , 10 , 37 , 43 , 44 ) .
Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , gamma interferon , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) mRNA levels all decrease after T cells are exposed to 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , , but the molecular mechanisms mediating these changes have not been fully described ( 9 , 58 , 66-69 , 79 ) .
T-cell activation is a key step in the initiation of an immu-nological response .

5789 a complex signaling cascade is initiated , resulting in cell proliferation and secretion of cytokines that enhance the immune response .
One of the first genes to be expressed postactivation is the IL-2 gene .
The lymphokine IL-2 exerts its influence by interacting with the IL-2 receptor on the surface of activated T cells , and this interaction is required for progression through the cell cycle ( transition from G , to S phase ) .
The kinetics of IL-2 induction are quite rapid , with transcripts detectable within 30 to 45 min after activation .
A complex enhancer , which includes 275 bp just downstream from the transcription start site ( -52 to -326 ) , has been exhaustively studied ( 16 , 24 , 75 ) .
Binding sites for several ubiquitous and T-cell-specific transcription factors were defined in this region , and the proteins that bind to these sites , including Oct-1 , AP1 , NF-kB , and NFATp/c , have been identified ( 65 ) .
Several agents , including the drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 ( 18 , 51 ) , as well as glucocorticoids ( 25 , 80 , 81 ) and retinoids ( 13 , 19 ) appear to act as immunosuppressors by targeting IL-2 expression .
1,25 ( OH ) ; , D , inhibits the entry of activated T cells into S phase ( 68 ) ; similar blocks at this point in the cell cycle have been demonstrated for other inhibitors of IL-2 synthesis , such as the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone ( 7 ) , further implicating IL-2 as a target for vitamin D ; , 's immunosuppressive effect .
These observations demonstrate an important role for 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; , in the immunomodulation of T lymphocytes but not the actual mechanism by which this regulation is carried out .
Since the signal transduction pathway of vitamin D , works directly through a hormone-inducible transcription factor , the VDR , we have focused our attention on how this nuclear receptor might mediate T-cell suppression .
Interestingly , only 5790 ALROY ET AL .
phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -activated , normal human T lymphocytes express VDR ( 8 ) .
Two potential ways the suppression might occur are ( i ) VDR enhances the transcription of a negative regulator of a key gene involved in T-cell activation , such as IL-2 , or ( ii ) VDR directly represses the transcription of such a gene ; several members of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily have been shown to act as both activators and repressors of transcription , depending on the particular gene and/or cell type ( for reviews , see references 56 , 62 , 64 , 73 , and 82 ) .
We demonstrate here that repression of IL-2 transcription by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is a direct , VDR-dependent effect .
Further , we delineate a region within the IL-2 promoter that mediates the repression ; this region coincides with the binding site for a complex critical for IL-2 transcriptional activation , NFAT ( nu-clear factor of activated T cells ) .
NFAT induction requires two activation-dependent events ; the cyclosporin A-sensitive trans-location of a lymphoid-specific , preexisting component , NFATp , and the protein kinase C-mediated stimulation of Jun and Fos ( 13 , 26 , 65 ) .
VDR , together with its heterodimeric partner RXR ( retinoid X receptor ) , targets this complex by blocking NFATp/AP-1 complex formation .
This process appears to require DNA binding by VDR to the composite NFATp/AP-1 element .
The net result is a loss of activated transcription of the IL-2 gene .

Plasmids .
A minimal promoter/luciferase reporter , pE1b-LUC , was constructed by cloning the Elb TATA box from pElb-CAT ( obtained from R. Roeder ) as a BamHI-Xhol fragment into the HindII-Xhol sites in pGL2-basic ( Promega ) .
Both BamHI in pE1b-CAT and HindIII in pGL2-basic were blunt ended by Klenow enzyme .
All upstream IL-2 reporter constructs were generated from pUPSTIL2-CAT .
The latter construct was derived from p41 ( 30 ) , containing 3.7 kb of the human IL-2 promoter and coding region .
p41 ( provided by U. Sicbenlist ) was digested with Clel , and the fragment was cloned into pSP73 , generating p41-SP73 .
An Ndel-PstI fragment of p41-SP73 was then cloned into pOTCO , a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmid , generating p41-TCO .
The resulting construct contained 200 bp of the coding sequence of the IL-2 gene which were deleted by exonuclease III digestion .
The resulting construct , pUPSTIL2-CAT , contained 2 kb of IL-2 enhancer sequences , the IL-2 RNA start site , and 45 bp of the IL-2 leader .
To construct p ( -1000 ) IL2-CAT , pUPSTIL2-CAT was digested with Bg/II and HindIII ( which was filled in with Klenow enzyme ) , deleting 1,000 bp of the upstream region .
The fragment was ligated into pOTCO which was cut with Sa/l ( the ends blunted by Klenow enzyme ) and Bg/lI .
The new construct encompassed 1,000 bp of the IL-2 enhancer/promoter .
Both p ( -800 ) IL2-CAT and p ( -428 ) IL2-CAT were generated by exonuclease III digestion of p ( -1000 ) IL2-CAT .
p ( -321 ) IL2-CAT was gen-crated by digesting pUPSTIL2-CAT with XmnI , and the ends were filled in by Klenow enzyme .
Subsequently , the vector was cut with Bg/II , and a 350-bp fragment was ligated into pOTCO which was cut with Se/l and Bg/IL p ( -321 ) IL2-LUC was generated from p ( -321 ) IL2-CAT by digestion with HindIII , and the ends were filled in by Klenow enzyme .
The DNA was then cleaved with a second restriction enzyme , Bg/lI .
The fragment was cloned into pGL2-basic ( Promega ) which was digested with and Bg/lI .
To construct p ( 100 ) ; E1b-LUC , 100 bp from the IL-2 enhancer ( -319 to -215 , relative to the start site ) were cloned 5 ' to the Elb TATA box in the pE1b-LUC reporter vector ( 45 ) .
To construct p ( NFAT-1 ) 4 ; E1b-LUC , an NFAT-1 oligonucleotide duplex ( top strand , 5'-CTA GCAGAAAGGAGGAAAAACTGTITTCATACAGAAGGCGTT-3 ) was phos-phorylated with T4 kinase ( Bethesda Research Laboratories ) and then cloned into the Nhe !
site of pE1b-LUC ( the annealed oligonucleotide was designed to have an NheI site at the 5 ' end and an Xbal site at the 3 ' end ) .
After dideoxy sequencing , it was established that the phagemid contained five copies of the NFAT-1 oligonucleotide , all in the same orientation .
The pSP6S-B-gal construct was generated by cloning the KprI-Pvul fragment from the B-galactosidase ( B-Gal ) gene ( 168 bp ) ( pCH110 ; Pharmacia ) into the polylinker of pSP6S .

Cell transfections and reporter assays .
The T-cell line Jurkat was transfected by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method .
Cells were grown in RPMI medium containing sodium pyruvate , glutamine , and penicillin-streptomycin .
Fetal calf serum was added to 10 % and cells , were maintained at a density of ~5 X 10°/ml .
Cells were gently suspended ( 10 '' /ml ) in transfection cocktail ( 0.6 mM chloro-quine diphosphate [ Sigma ] ) , 0.25 mg of DEAE-dextran [ Pharmacia ] per ml in minimal essential medium containing 10 pg of reporter plasmid per ml and 2 pg of producer plasmid per ml ) .
Cells were incubated in transfection cocktail for 2.5 h in an incubator ( 5 % CO , , 37°C ) , and then the cells were washed .
Subsequently , the cells were resuspended ( 10/15 ml ) in RPMI-sodium pyruvate-glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin medium containing 10 % charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum .
At 40 h posttransfection , cells were treated in one of the following ways for 8 h : no treatment ; addition of 2 x 10~° M 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , ( Biomol ) ; addition of PHA ( 2 pg/ml ; Sigma ) and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate ( TPA ; 50 ng/ml ; Sigma ) ( activating agents ) ; or addition of horm one and activating agents to-gether .
Experiments were normalized to protein concentration when CAT reporters were used ; when luciferase reporters were used , Rous sarcoma virus-CAT supercoiled DNA ( 10 ug/ml ) was added to the transfection cocktail and relative light units were normalized to CAT activity .
To determine CAT activity , cell extracts were obtained and assayed by ethyl acetate phase extraction of `` *C-acetylated chloramphenicol and quantitated by scintillation counting .
When luciferase constructs were transfected , the cell pellet was divided into two ; half was used for CAT assays as described above , and the second half was used to determine luciferase activity as described previously ( 72 ) .
RNA analysis .
Jurkat cells ( 10 ' per treatment ) were transfected with p ( -321 ) IL2-LUC ( 10 pg ) , pCMV-VDR ( 2 pg ) , and pRSV-B-gal ( 10 ug ) vectors as described for the transfection protocol .
At 40 h posttransfection , the cells were treated with different combinations of 10 mM cycloheximide ( 10 mM ) , PHA ( 2 pg/tol ) , and TPA ( 50 ng/ml ) , and 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; ( 2 x 10~® M ) , as specified .
At the end of each treatment ( total of 4 h ) , the cells were washed twice in ice-cold 1 % phosphate-buffered saline and cytoplasmic RNA was prepared by Nonidet P-40 lysis .
Luciferase riboprobe was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase from plasmid pGEM-LUC ( Promega ) linearized with EcoRV ; the probe extended 400 bp , which were all protected by luciferase RNA .
The B-gal riboprobe was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from pSP65-B-gal linearized by EcoRI , resulting in 200 bp , 180 of which hybridized to B-gal RNA .
RNA from the indicated treated transfected cells was analyzed by RNase protection assay of luciferase and B-gal antisense probes ( 50 and 20 jg cytoplasmic RNA , respectively ) except that 40 ug of RNase A ( Sigma ) per ml and 2 pg of RNase T ; ( Bethesda Research Laboratories ) per ml were used .
Gel mobility shift electrophoresis .
VDR DNA binding was assessed by gel mobility shift electrophoresis as described previously ( 3 , 21 ) .
For gel shifts from Jurkat cell extracts , nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat cells ( 2 x 10°/ml , 400 ml ) as described previously ( 16 ) .
Purified VDR , mutant protein derivatives , and nuclear extract were incubated with 0.1 to 0.5 ng ( 30,000 to 50,000 cpm ) of labeled NFAT-1 oligonucleotide probe at room temperature for 20 min , together with 1 ng of poly ( dI-dC ) and a binding buffer to final concentrations of 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 0.05 % Nonidet P-40 , 10 % glycerol , 50 mM KCI , and 1 mM dithiothreitol .
Protein-DNA complexes were then resolved by electrophoresis on 6 % nondenaturing acrylamide gels ( 75:1 acrylamide/bisacryl-amide ) run in 0.5 % Tris-borate-EDTA , at 26 V/cm at 4°C .
Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography overnight with a screen .
When purified Jun , Fos , and NFATp proteins were used , the binding buffer was supplemented with bovine serum albumin to 0.3 % .
VDR and its derivatives and/or RXR were preincubated with Jun and Fos for 10 min at 30°C unless otherwise indicated .
Tubes were transferred to ice and cooled for 5 min , and the protein mixture was added to DNA .
NFATp was then added , and the proteins were incubated with DNA for 20 min on ice .

An equal volume of a mixture of 10 mM MgCl , and 5 mM CaCl , was added at the end of the incubation , and samples were digested for 1 min at room temperature with DNase I ( 5 pl of a 1:20,000 dilution ) ( Bethesda Research Laboratories ) .
Immediately at the end of this incubation , 200 pl of a solution containing 200 mM NaCl , 40 mM EDTA , 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 100 pg of proteinase K per ml , and 125 ug of glycogen ( Boehringer Mannheim ) per ml was added , and the reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37°C .
The samples were then extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl mixture and then ethanol precipitated .
Subsequently , equal values of precipitated counts from all samples were separated on an 8 M urea-8 % polyacrylamide gel , and the gel was dried and exposed to film with a screen at -70°C .
RESULTS Repression by VDR is mediated directly on the IL-2 enhancer .
To localize the region conferring inhibition by 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , , four deletion derivatives of the IL-2 enhancer fused to the CAT gene , p ( -1000 ) IL2-CAT , p ( -800 ) IL2-CAT , p ( -428 ) IL2-CAT , and p ( -321 ) IL2-CAT ( Fig .
1A ) , were generated by exonuclease digestion of the upstream 2,000 nucle-otides ; these constructs were used to cotransfect Jurkat cells with or without a VDR producer plasmid .
The cells were untreated , treated for 8 h with the activating agents phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) or TPA and with phytochemaggluti-nin ( PHA ) , with 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; alone , or with activating agents and 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , .
Activation levels were reduced 70 to 80 % in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , and VDR in all of the IL-2 enhancer/deletion constructs ( Fig .
1B ) , indicating that the proximal 321 bp of the enhancer contained a region which is sufficient to mediate the repression by the receptor .
The 1,25 ( OH ) , D , -mediated repression was always stronger when the VDR producer plasmid was cotransfected , since T cells express VDR only 6 to 8 h postactivation ( 8 ) .
This finding also indicates that VDR is limiting in these cells for the repression .
5792 ALROY ET AL .
The 321-bp region corresponds to the minimal enhancer region which was previously characterized as mediating IL-2-specific activation in response to signals originating from the cell surface ( 16 , 24 , 75 ) .
Repression of IL-2 transcription by VDR could occur by one of at least three mechanisms : ( i ) VDR binds directly to an element within the IL-2 enhancer and/or interacts with positive factors that bind to this element , inhibiting the action of that factor ( direct effect ) ; ( ii ) VDR represses the expression of a key positive regulator of IL-2 expression ( indirect ) ; or ( iii ) VDR induces the expression of a repressor that in turn inhibits IL-2 transcription ( indirect ) .
If the effect is direct , then VDR-mediated repression should not be expected to be sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors .
Repression of IL-2 transcription by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , was therefore analyzed in Jurkat cells in the presence of cycloheximide and anisomycin .
Cells were cotransfected with an IL-2 reporter carrying the IL-2 promoter/enhancer driving luciferase expression [ p ( -321 ) IL2-LUC ] , a VDR producer ( pCMV-VDR ) , and RSV-B-gal as a normalizing reporter .
In all cases , cells were allowed to express VDR for 40 h following transfection prior to treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitors and/or hormone ( Fig .
2A ) .
No effect of VDR was expected during this time period , since the receptor was expressed in the absence of any added ligand in cells growing in charcoal-stripped serum .
Activation of IL-2 and luciferase message synthesis by PHA and phorbol myristate acetate in the presence and absence of 1,25 ( OH ) ; , D ; was then monitored by RNase protection .
IL-2 activation itself is dependent on de novo protein synthesis and thus served as a positive control for inhibition by cycloheximide and anisomycin .
Cells were treated with protein synthesis inhibitors 30 min before activation , and as expected , no IL-2 mRNA was detected in response to activation ( Fig .
2B , lane 3 ) .
When cells were activated in the presence of 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , the luciferase-specific mRNA was inhibited ( compare lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Importantly , this inhibition was apparent even when 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; treatment was preceded by the addition of protein synthesis inhibitors ( Fig .
2B , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
Thus , repression of IL-2 mRNA synthesis by 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; is independent of de novo protein synthesis and represents a direct effect on the IL-2 enhancer by VDR .
A short subregion in the IL-2 enhancer mediates repression by VDR .
The promoter-proximal 321-bp segment of the IL-2 promoter contains several binding sites for a variety of transcription factors that mediate the induction of IL-2 expression ( 13 , 26 , 28 ) .
We were concerned that any attempt to delete further downstream in order to map the subregion mediating vitamin D ; , repression might compromise activation , resulting in a concomitant lower sensitivity to repression .
We therefore chose to delineate the repression site by assaying for in vitro DNA binding by the receptor , initially using the 321-bp IL-2 enhancer element as a probe in a DNase I footprinting assay ( Fig .
3A ) .
Two closely linked protected regions were iden-tified ; the first footprint is from -283 to -278 , and the second spans -266 to -252 .
The footprinted region overlaps an important positive IL-2 recognition element , called NF-AT-1 ( 52 ) , that contains a weak API site and a binding site for an inducible factor in T cells , NFATp ( 65 ) .
A 41-bp oligonucleotide duplex corresponding to the sequence shown in Fig .
3A and containing both the NF-AT-1 element and the putative VDR-binding site was synthesized and used as a probe in a gel shift assay ; as little as 20 ng of purified VDR shifted this element ( Fig .
3B ) .
To test if the NF-AT-1 site alone could mediate 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; -specific repression in vivo , five copies of this oligonucleotide were cloned into an Elb TATA-driving luciferase reporter and used in transfec- Mor .

tion assays .
At least three copies of the NF-AT-1 element have been previously shown to confer strong transcriptional activation in response to cell surface activation signals ( 17 ) .
When Jurkat cells were cotransfected with this construct and with a VDR producer , 1,25 ( OH ) , D , -specific repression of luciferase activity was observed ( Fig .
3C ) .
A much lower , but detectable , repression due to endogenous VDR was also seen .
These results demonstrate that VDR can bind to and mediate its repressive effect through the same minimal element is required for IL-2 transcriptional activation , namely , the NFAT-1 site .
RXR enhances the inhibition conferred by VDR .
RXR is considered to be the heterodimeric partner of VDR .
It strongly enhances VDR 's binding to a positive vitamin D response element in vitro and has been shown to be important in mediating 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; transcription activation in vivo ( 12 , 39 , 48 , 76 ) .
Therefore , RXR 's contribution to transcriptional repression was tested ( Fig .

DNA binding and transcriptional repression by VDR is localized to the NFAT region of the IL-2 enhancer .
( A ) DNase I protection of the IL-2 enhancer by VDR .
£ .
coli-expressed purified VDR protein ( 50 to 1,000 ng ) was used in the DNase I footprint analysis on the proximal 321 bp of the IL-2 enhancer , which conferred inhibition in the transactivation assays .
Indicated below is the NF-AT-1 element and surrounding sequences .
The NFATp- and Jun-Fos-binding sites are underlined , and the two VDR protected regions are overlined .
( B ) VDR binding to a 41-bp element containing the distal NF-AT-1 site .
An oligonucleotide duplex ( top strand , 5'-CTAGCAGAAAGGAGGAAAAACTGTITTCATAGAGAAGGCGTT-3 ' ) was used as a probe and incubated with 0 to 150 ng of purified VDR , and binding was assayed by gel shift .
( C ) VDR mediates repression of IL-2 activation in vivo through the NF-AT-1 site .
Cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing five copies of the NF-AT-1 oligonucleotide [ p ( NF-AT-1 ) , -E1b-LUC ] and with pCMV-VDR or pRC-CMV .
Cell treatment and normalization were as described for Fig .
1B .
The data represent the averages of three independent experiments .
was used to cotransfect Jurkat cells with wild-type VDR together with the p ( -321 ) IL2-LUC reporter , and cells were treated as before .
1,25 ( OH ) ; , D , repression was nearly twofold higher when both VDR and RXR were cotransfected than when VDR was transfected alone .
Levels of repression with VDR alone are lower in this assay than in previous experiments ( i.e. , 40 % in this assay versus 60 to 70 % in the assay shown in Fig .
2B ) since half as much VDR producer plasmid was used in this experiment .
Transfection of the RXR producer alone augmented the repression seen by the endogenous VDR receptor somewhat but not to the level observed when VDR is overexpressed , indicating that VDR and not RXR is the limiting factor for repression ( Fig .
4 ) .
RXR therefore plays a role in the vitamin D , repression of IL-2 transcription , presumably through heterodimerization with VDR .
Consistent with this inference , in vitro DNA binding of VDR to the NFAT-1 element is enhanced by RXR ( see Fig .
5B ) .
VDR DNA binding alone is necessary but not sufficient for repression .
Transcriptional repression by steroid and nuclear receptors appears to require an intact DBD and in some cases DNA binding ; however , in several examples , protein-protein interactions independent of DNA binding are sufficient for repression ( 27 , 38 , 40 , 73 , 83 ) .
To determine the contributions of both the DBD and direct DNA binding by VDR to the NFAT-1 site in mediating the IL-2 repression , several mutant VDR derivatives were generated ( Fig .
SA ) .
Changes were introduced at various positions within the first zinc module of the VDR DBD that forms a specificity « -helix ; in a variety of nuclear receptor DBD crystal structures , side chain contacts with bases occur exclusively within this subregion of the DBD ( 47 ) .
Thus , the expectation was that amino acid changes at G-46 and R-49 to A and K , respectively ( residues found in several other nuclear receptors at these positions ) , changing R-50 to G , or changing the P-box triplet EGG at positions 42 , 43 , and 46 to GSV ( the corresponding residues in the glucocorticoid receptor ) would drastically alter or abolish VDR-DNA binding .
Three such mutant derivatives , EGG-GSV , G46A/ R49K , and R50G , were all overexpressed in £ .
coli , purified to homogeneity , and tested for their relative abilities to bind to the NFAT-1 element in vitro .
As shown in Fig .
5B , all three mutant proteins were unable to bind the NFAT probe , in the presence or absence of RXR , under conditions in which the wild-type VDR bound the element with high affinity .
Importantly , the EGG-GSV mutant bound a chimeric direct repeat element with high affinity in the presence of RXR , indicating that these amino acid changes did not disrupt the overall fold of the DBD ( 42 ) but rather only altered its specificity ( 22 ) .
A fourth derivative , the VDR DBD alone ( VDRF ; residues 14 to 114 ) , which binds selectively and with high affinity to a positive vitamin D response element ( 23 ) , was also assayed for binding to the NF-AT-1 element .
In contrast to the other mutants , this derivative was able to bind strongly to the NF-AT-1 probe ( Fig .
5B , lanes 14 to 18 ) .
To test the activities of these mutant VDRs in vivo , Jurkat cells were cotransfected with wild-type VDR , the three mutant VDRs , or VDRF , together with p ( -321 ) IL2-LUC , and repression of activation was assessed .
As seen in Fig .
5C , the ability of each of the mutants and VDRF to repress IL-2 expression was abolished or significantly less than that of wild-type VDR .
The residual repression detected from the mutant receptors most likely derives from the 10 % inhibition attributed to the endogenous VDR in Jurkat cells .
One mutant , G46A/R49K , partially repressed beyond the endogenous level ( i.e. , 33 % ) and was in fact able to bind very weakly but reproducibly to the NFAT-1 element in vitro ( Fig .
5B , lane 10 , and data not shown ) .
Note that VDRF , which lacks the ligand-binding do-main , should have repressed independently of hormone if it were functional .
Immunoblotting revealed that these proteins were expressed at the same levels as wild-type VDR following transfection ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that DNA binding by VDR is necessary for the repression of IL-2 expression , since the VDR DBD mutants were 5794 ALROY ET AL .

1,25 ( OH ) , D , -mediated repression is enhanced by RXR .
Jurkat cells were cotransfected with an RXRa or VDR producer plasmid ( 1 ug ) alone or together , or with the parent vector pRe-CMV ( - ) , and with p-321 ( IL2-LUC ) .

unable to either bind in vitro to the NF-AT-1 element or repress in vivo .
DNA binding alone , however , is apparently not sufficient , because the VDR DBD bound the element but nevertheless could not repress activated IL-2 transcription .
VDR inhibits NFAT complex formation on DNA in vitro .
The results shown in Fig .
5 suggest that other interactions in addition to simple DNA binding by VDR are implicated in 1,25 ( OH ) , D , -mediated repression of IL-2-activated transcription .
This would most likely involve protein-protein contacts between VDR and the positive components that bind to the NF-AT-1 site , namely , NFATp and Jun-Fos ( 11 , 33-35 , 54 , 55 , 60 , 61 ) .
To more carefully examine VDR 's role in NFAT complex formation , nuclear extracts were made from resting and activated Jurkat cells , and their levels of binding to the NFAT-1 oligonucleotide probe were assessed by gel mobility shift assay .
A PMA- and PHA -inducible complex was detected with nuclear extracts from activated cells and to a much lower extent with extracts from resting cells ( Fig .
6A ; compare lanes 1 and 3 ) .
The weak shift detected with extracts from resting cells was probably due to some leaking of NF-ATp protein from the cytoplasm during extract preparation .
Interestingly , both activated and resting cells extract shifts were inhibited when E. coli-expressed purified VDR was added to the reaction ( lanes 2 and 4 ) .
When the £ .
coli-expressed and purified components of the NFAT-1 binding complex , i.e. , the DBD fragment of murine NFATp and full-length human Jun and Fos , were incubated together with the NF-AT-1 oligonucleotide probe , two specific shifts were detected ( Fig .
6B , lane 9 ) .
The lower complex corresponds to the NFATp protein bound to DNA , and the more slowly migrating complex corresponds to a Jun-Fos-NFATp-DNA complex ( 54 ) .
Jun and Fos were unable to bind on their own to this element ( Fig .
6B , lane 2 ) , since the AP-1 site here constitutes a very weak recognition sequence ( 55 ) .
When VDR alone or the VDR-RXR heterodimer was combined with Jun , Fos , and NFATp , complex formation was significantly inhibited , with the heterodimer inhibiting to a greater extent ( compare lanes 3 and 7 with lane 9 ) .
Neither the DNA-binding-defective VDR-R50G , the DBD ( VDRF ) , nor RXR alone inhibited the formation of the NFATp-Jun-Fos complex ( lanes 4 to 6 ) .
In addition , the inhibition by VDR-RXR was specific for the functional heterodimer , since VDR-R50G together with RXR was unable to affect the complex Mor .

Indicated above each lane are the proteins used in the binding reaction .
VDR , VDR-RXR , or one of the VDR derivatives was preincubated for 10 min with Jun and Fos in binding buffer .

Arrows indicate positions of protein-DNA complexes and free DNA .
Fos to DNA , thus stabilizing the Jun-Fos-NFATp complex on the NF-AT-1 element ( 34 , 55 ) .
The VDR-RXR heterodimer may act to inhibit the interaction between NFAT p and Jun-Fos prior to their DNA binding , or it may destabilize the complex itself once bound to DNA .
To distinguish between these two possibilities , the VDR-RXR heterodimer was added to the gel shift reaction either before or after the NFATp-Jun-Fos complex was combined with the DNA probe .
As shown in Fig .
7 , the VDR-RXR heterodimer was able to repress the NFAT-specific complex only when added before , not after , the addition of DNA ( compare lanes 3 and 4 ) .
This result suggests that the receptor interferes with the NFAT recruitment of Jun-Fos to DNA but can not displace the complex once it is bound .
To examine this observation in more detail , an off-rate experiment was carried out by simultaneously mixing Jun , Fos , NFATp , and DNA in the presence or absence of VDR-RXR and allowing them to incubate together for 1 h. At the end of this incubation , equal aliquots were removed and added to a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF-AT-1 competitor DNA for times ranging from 0 to 60 min .

The gel mobility shift assay conditions and the amounts of proteins used are exactly as described in the legend to Fig .

Above each lane , the order of addition is indicated .
Fos complex was observed ; NFATp alone was considerably more unstable ( half-life of < 2 min ) .
When VDR-RXR was included in the reaction , however , very little NFATp-Jun-Fos complex was detected , even at the earliest time point .
Instead , VDR and VDR-RXR complexes were apparent and were stable through 60 min of competition .
The NFATp complex alone displayed the same kinetics as it does in the absence of VDR-RXR , implying that on its own , this protein is not the target of the receptors .
Taken together , these results indicate that VDR-RXR can block NFAT complex formation on DNA both by interfering with the assembly of the complex on DNA and by slow-kinetic binding to an overlapping DNA sequence .
Since some residual NFAT p is always bound to DNA ( Fig .
7 and reference 55 ) , an effective way to block the recruitment of Jun and Fos to the NFAT-1 element is by the formation of a stable VDR-RXR complex on DNA , which may subsequently displace NFAT p from DNA and preclude additional binding .

DISCUSSION Repression of T-cell proliferation and IL-2 gene expression by the active metabolite of vitamin D , 1,25 ( OH ) ; D ; , has been documented in the literature .
However , the molecular mechanism underlying this repression has not been characterized .
In this work , we have attempted to elucidate the mechanism of IL-2 transcriptional repression by this hormone .
We have found that the repression of IL-2 transcriptional activation by 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; is mediated directly on the IL-2 promoter by VDR .
Both transfection and in vitro DNA-binding assays indicate that the receptor confers this repression most effectively in the form of a VDR-RXR heterodimer .
The specific target for VDR is a protein complex composed of a lymphoid cell-specific transcription factor , NFATp , and the ubiquitous transcription factors Jun and Fos .
This complex binds to a site centered at -270 in the IL-2 enhancer and alone can mediate IL-2 activation .
This short element is therefore able to confer both the activation and repression of IL-2 transcription .
Different repression mechanisms have been proposed for steroid/nuclear receptor family members .
In some cases , DNA binding is required ( 2 , 14 , 15 , 31 , 70 , 71 , 84 ) , while in other examples , protein-protein interactions appear to be sufficient in conferring repression ( 36 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 70a , 74 , 83 , 85 ) .
We have demonstrated here that DNA binding by VDR occurs within or just proximal to the NF-AT-1 element and that DNA binding is necessary but does not appear to be sufficient for the repression .
On the one hand , we introduced into the VDR DBD several point mutations that abolish both in vitro DNA binding to the NF-AT-1 element and transrepression of IL-2-activated transcription ( Fig .
5 ) .
On the other hand , regions outside the VDR DBD must also be required , since a derivative encompassing just the DBD , VDRF , was capable of binding the NF-AT-1 element with high affinity but was unable to inhibit IL-2 gene transcription ( Fig .
5 ) .
These results suggest that VDR may interact with NFATp , Fos , or Jun , in addition to binding directly to DNA .
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in the presence of a reversible cross-linker have been carried out that indeed demonstrate an in vitro interaction of Jun or Fos with VDR in the absence of DNA ( 2a ) .
Of the transcription factors that bind to the NF-AT-1 element , it is NFATp that primarily determines the DNA-binding specificity of the NFAT complex in vivo and in vitro , whereas at least a portion of the transcriptional activity is provided by Jun and Fos ( 54 , 64a ) .
NFAT complex assembly occurs via high-affinity binding of NFATp to DNA , which in turn recruits Jun and Fos and in the process stabilizes the whole complex on DNA ( 59 ) .
The interactions that take place between these factors and VDR were tested in a gel mobility shift blocking assay .
Purified , full-length VDR was able to inhibit NFAT complex formation on DNA when the source of NFAT was an activated T-cell nuclear extract .
Similarly , VDR inhibited the assembly of purified Jun , Fos , and NFATp on the NF-AT-1 element ( Fig .
6 ) .
The addition of RXR enhanced the ability of VDR to inhibit NFATp-Jun-Fos complex formation on DNA .
This result is in agreement with our transfection results , which indicated that RXR enhanced the observed repression of IL-2 transcription by VDR .
Moreover , the VDR-RXR heterodimer was able to inhibit complex formation only when added before the addition of DNA ; a prebound NFATp-Jun-Fos complex was not destabilized by the receptor ( Fig .
7 ) .
Importantly , both VDRF and VDR-R50G , neither of which could repress IL-2 expression in vivo , were unable to inhibit NFATp-Jun-Fos-DNA complex formation in vitro ( Fig .
6B ) .
That one of these VDR mutants binds DNA ( VDRF ) and the other does not ( VDR-R50G ) again points to a repression model that requires both protein-protein interactions and DNA binding .
How then might VDR mediate the 1,25 ( OH ) , D , -dependent repression of IL-2 transcription in T cells ?
The data presented here indicate that VDR-RXR heterodimers , which would form in response to the intracellular presence of 1,25 ( 0OH ) ; , D ; , could interfere with the assembly of the transcriptionally active NFATp-Jun-Fos-DNA complex by precluding the interaction between Jun-Fos and NFATp , since prebound NFATp-Jun-Fos can not be destabilized by VDR-RXR ( Fig .
7 ) .
Even if , as suggested from the off-rate experiment shown in Fig .
8 , VDR Vou .
15 , 1995 inhibits only Jun-Fos and permits NFATp protein to bind the DNA element , NFATp 's half-life on the NFAT-1 element is extremely short ( 33 ) , and so it would in turn dissociate from the DNA .
The stable association of VDR-RXR on the NFAT-1 element ( Fig .
8 ) would presumably block any subsequent assembly of the NFAT complex .
The NF-AT-1 site in the IL-2 promoter could be an example of a complex composite DNA recognition element for NFATp , Jun-Fos , and VDR , since it appears to selectively bind all of these factors .
Similar composite elements have been described for other examples of steroid receptor-mediated repression ( 14 , 56 , 57 , 73 ) .
Given that glucocorticoids are known to be potent inhibitors of IL-2 transcription and that the glucocorticoid receptor interacts with Jun-Fos , it is possible that the mechanism that we propose here for VDR might be a paradigm for how steroids and vitamin derivatives ( i.e. , vitamin D ; and retinoids ) down-regulate the transcription of cytokines such as IL-2 , resulting in a suppression of the immune response .
Several cytokine genes other than the IL-2 gene may be regulated by NFATp or a growing list of NFAT family mem-bers , such as NFAT c ( 20 ) , NFAT ' x ( 50 ) , NFAT-3 , and NFAT -4 ( 29 ) .
GM-CSF , IL-3 , IL-4 , and tumor necrosis factor alpha all have NFAT elements in their promoters ( 65 ) .
The NFAT-binding sites identified in the GM-CSF promoter differ from the IL-2 element in that the AP-1 sites are of high affinity and the NFAT sites are weak .
The IL-4 enhancer harbors five independent NFAT sites , and at least four of these sites , including one strong NFATp-binding site , are required for promoter induction and also may form complexes with Jun and Fos ( 64a ) .
The NFAT element in the tumor necrosis factor alpha gene appears to have diverged considerably from other NFAT -binding sites ; it binds two molecules of NFAT p as well as Jun but does not contain Fos ( 52 ) .
It is not known whether VDR represses the transcription of these genes , but GM-CSF mRNA levels are negatively regulated by 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; , as assessed by Northern ( RNA ) blot analysis ( 77 ) .
The work presented here suggests that the presence of an AP-1 site as part of a composite NFAT element in these cytokine promoters may mediate 1,25 ( OH ) , D ; repression or repression by other steroid/nuclear hormone receptors in a manner similar or identical to what we have described here for IL-2 .
