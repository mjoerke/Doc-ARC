Shuxun Liu , Yizhi Yu , Minghui Zhang , Wenya Wang , and Xuetao Cao TNF-a-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) is characterized by its preferential induction of apoptosis of tumor cells but not normal cells .
Dendritic cells ( DCs ) , besides their role as APCs , now have been demonstrated to exert cytotoxicity or cytostasis on some tumor cells .
Here , we report that both human CD34* stem cell-derived DCs ( CD34DCs ) and human CD14* monocyte-derived DCs ( MoDCs ) express TRAIL and exhibit cytotoxicity to some types of tumor cells partially through TRAIL .
Moderate expression of TRAIL appeared on CD3MADCs from the 8th day of culture and was also seen on freshly isolated monocytes .
The level of TRAIL expression remained constant until DC maturation .
TRAIL expression on immature CD34DCs or MoDCs was greatly up-regulated after IFN- stimulation .
Moreover , IFN- could strikingly enhance the ability of CD34DCs or MoDCs to kill TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells , but LPS did not have such an effect .
The up-regulation of TRAIL on IFN -- stimulated DCs partially contributed to the increased cytotoxicity of DCs .
Pretreatment of TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells with caspase-3 inhibitor could significantly increase their resistance to the cytotoxicity of IFN- $ -stimulated DCs .
In contrast , NF-KB inhibitor could significantly increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to the killing by nonstimulated or LPS-stimulated DCs .
Our studies demonstrate that IFN -- stimulated DCs are functionally cytotoxic .
Thus , an innate mechanism of DC-mediated antitumor immunity might exist in vivo in which DCs act as effectors to directly kill tumor cells partially via TRAIL .
Subsequently , DCs act as APCs involved in the uptake , processing , and presentation of apoptotic tumor Ags to cross-prime CD8* CTL cells .
The Journal of Immunology , 2001 , 166 : 5407-5415. endritic cells ( DCs ) , '' as highly specialized Ag APCs , are D responsible for the induction of primary immune responses ( 1 ) .
DCs play critical roles in antitumor or an-tivirus immune responses , autoimmune diseases , and graft rejec-tion .
The participation of CD8 * CTL cells that are induced by cross-priming by DCs is considered a major mechanism involved in such immune responses .
Exogenous antigenic peptides are cross-presented by DCs to T cells in the form of peptide-MHC class I complexes , thus stimulating Ag-specific CTL responses .
The induction of specific CD8 * CTL is a major possibility in the treatment of cancer ( 2-4 ) .
To date , DC-based tumor vaccinations in the treatment of cancer patients have shown promising results from clinical trials ( 5-8 ) .
Apoptotic tumor cells are considered more effective than tumor debris or tumor cells alone at supplying host DCs with a source of antigenic epitopes for cross-priming autologous CD8 * CTLs ( 9 , 10 ) .
Bystander apoptotic cells are able to trigger DC maturation to Ag presentation function even without Department of Immunology , Second Military Medical University , Shanghei , People 's Republic of China Received for publication August 11 , 2000 .

In the capturing of Ags , the « , f , and CD36 molecules on DCs possibly mediate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells ; whereas in processing and presentation , heat shock protein 70 and other maturation factors released from apoptotic cells are likely to help induction of DC maturation and direct antigenic peptides for MHC class I presentation ( 12 , 13 ) .
Optimal cross-priming of CD8 * CTLs by DC 's requires both apoptotic bodies for Ags and necrotic cells for delivering maturation signals ( 14 ) .
Nevertheless , a critical prerequisite is the existence of apoptotic bodies , but little is known about their origin .
Innate defense mechanisms are comprised of macrophages , NK cells , comple-ment , and interferons , which can directly delete pathogens or unwanted cells .
Although it is well known that DCs are widely distributed in peripheral tissues , are important as a first line of defense , and make regular encounters with tumor cells , there is no evidence that DCs also belong to the natural defense arm of the immune response , directly eliminating deleterious factors .
Some reports suggest that DCs may have a direct role in the elimination of malignant cells .
In murine tumor models , injection of DCs can inhibit growth of tumors to some degree ( 15 , 16 ) .
In rats , NKR-P1* spleen DCs possess cytotoxic activity toward NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells ( 17 ) .
In humans , activated DCs appear to suppress growth of a variety spectrum of tumor cell lines in vitro ( 18 ) .
Furthermore , Fanger et al .
( 19 ) have shown that a peripheral blood subset of CD11c* DCs , but not IL-3Ra* pre-DC 's , stimulated by IFN-y or IFN-a @ can induce cellular apoptosis in several tumor cells .
Recently , numerous apoptosis-inducing ligands have been dis-covered , most of them belonging to the TNF family ( 20-24 ) TNE-a-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) , a newly discovered member of the TNF family , together with €D95 ligand ( CD95L ) and TNF- « , belongs to subgroup of apoptosis-inducing ligands ( 25-27 ) .
The corresponding death receptors are members of the 0022-1767/01/ $ 02.00 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor 5408 CYTOTOXICITY OF IFN-B-STIMULATED HUMAN DC TO TUMOR CELLS TNFR family , the cytoplasmic regions of which all contain a crucial domain for mediating apoptotic signals , called the death domain .
Upon the oligomerization of these receptors triggered by their ligands on the surface , the death domains can recruit intracellular signal molecules , such as Fas-associated death domain-containing protein ( FADD ) , which can activate downstream caspase cascades leading to a series of apoptotic events ( 28 ) .
Unlike CD95L and TNF-a , TRAIL was characterized by selective induction of apoptotic cell death in a variety of tumor cells or transformed cells , but not in normal cells .
The TRAIL-resistant property of normal cells and some tumor cells may be due to the expression of its two decoy receptors and some intracellularly resistant molecules , such as cellular FADD-like IL-1B-converting enzyme protease-inhibitory protein ( c-FLIP ) ; and to the activation of antiapoptotic mechanisms , e.g. , NF- « B activation ( 29-36 ) .
TRAIL has been shown to participate in the tumoricidal activity of CD4 * T cells , NK cells , monocytes , and DCs under certain conditions ( 19 , 26 , 37 , 38 ) .
However , there have been no reports concerning the killing of tumor cells by in vitro cultured human CD34* stem cell-derived DCs ( CD34DCs ) and human CD14* monocyte-derived DCs ( MoDCs ) via TRAIL .
The major aim of this study was to investigate whether human CD34DCs and MoDCs cultured in vitro are able to kill TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells via TRAIL and to dissect relevant intracellular mechanisms .
Our studies revealed that IFN- could enhance the cytotoxicity of CD34DCs or MoDCs to TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells , which was partially related to the up-regulation of TRAIL expression .
However , a maturation factor , LPS , did not have such an effect .
The cytotoxicity of DCs toward tumor cells was regulated by activation of both the caspase cascade and the NF- « B pathway in tumor cells .
The physiological and pathological significance of the phenomenon is discussed .

Results TRAIL expression on human DCs derived from CD34 '' stem cells or peripheral blood monocytes We detected the kinetic expression of TRAIL on two kinds of distinct precursor-derived DCs , CD34DCs and MoDCs , during their differentiation and development in vitro .
CD34DC 's were generated from CD34 * hemopoietic progenitors in bone marrow in the presence of GM-CSF plus TNF- « for 14 days .
During this period , we examined TRAIL expression and DC-specific phenotype on the cultured cells at different stages .
As shown in Table I , CD34 * stem cells ( purity up to 94 % ) did not express TRAIL .
After 4 days of culture , these cells still did not express TRAIL , the costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40 , the monocyte marker CD14 , or the DC maturity marker CD83 ; but did express moderate levels of HLA-DR .
Expression of TRAIL was evident on the 8th day of culture , along with CD14 and CD40 .
HLA-DR expression was also up-regulated at this time , but CD86 and CD83 molecules were not yet expressed .
In addition , adherent DC-like clusters could be seen ( data not shown ) .
By the 10th day of culture , levels of TRAIL remained constant , and the phenotype revealed that the DCs were still immature , although they showed the appearance of typical veils or dendritic processes ( data not shown ) .
On the 14th day of culture , TRAIL expression was still stable .
HLA-DR was expressed on up to 98 % of cells , the costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40 were expressed on more than one-half of cells , CD14 was down-regulated to control level , and the CD83 maturation marker was expressed , which suggested that at this stage mature DCs were present .
In addition , < 5 % of cultured cells expressed CD3 , CD16 , or CD19 after 8 days of culture , showing that there was very little contamination with T cells , NK cells , or B cells ( data not shown ) .
In summary , TRAIL expression appeared in the middle of CD34DC differentiation and the level was maintained until the mature stage .
MoDC 's were induced from peripheral blood CD14 * monocytes cultured in the presence of GM-CSF plus IL-4 for 7 days .
As shown in Table II , TRAIL expression was detected on freshly isolated monocytes ( purity up to 99 % ) , and the level of TRAIL expression was moderate .
After 7 days of culture , the cells expressed high levels of HLA-DR , moderate levels of the costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40 and the maturation marker CD83 , but no CD14 .
Moreover , they showed veiled or dendritic morphology , indicating that they were mature MoDCs .
In addition , contamination with cells of other lineages ( CD3 T cells , CD16 NK cells , and Table II .

TRAIL expression was up-regulated on the human MoDCs and CD34DCs stimulated with IFN-B but not with LPS .
Human MoDCs ( cultured for 5 days ) or CD34DCs ( cultured for 12 days ) were incubated in the absence or presence of IFN-B ( 100 ng/m ! )

During the time spanning maturation from CD14* monocytes to mature MoDC 's , the level of TRAIL expression was slightly down-regulated .
Up-regulation of TRAIL expression on the surface of MoDCs and CD34DC 's by IFN-B stimulation Many studies have shown that different subpopulations of PBMC can express TRAIL under certain conditions .
TRAIL expression has been shown to be up-regulated on CD3 - NK1.1*~ NK cells after IL-2 or IL-15 stimulation ; on activated T cells after PHA or anti-CD3 mAb stimulation ; and on macrophages or CD11c* DCs after IFN-y or IFN-a « stimulation ( 19 , 26 , 27 , 37 , 38 ) .
To date there have been no data concerning the change of TRAIL expression on CD34DCs or MoDCs .
Considering that IFN-y or IFN-a « have been shown to stimulate TRAIL expression on CD11¢c ' DCs , we evaluated whether IFN-B could also produce the same effect on CD34DCs or MoDCs .
In addition , we examined the effect of LPS ( which can induce DC into maturation ) on the regulation of TRAIL expression of DCs .
As shown in Fig .
1 , the level of TRAIL on the 12th day of culture of CD34DCs was increased by IFN-B stimulation , compared with levels seen in unstimulated CD34DCs .
However , TRAIL expression was downregulated after LPS stimulation .
When MoDCs cultured for 5 days were examined , IFN-B was seen to significantly up-regulate TRAIL expression , whereas LPS had no effect .
Growth inhibition of hemopoietic origin tumor cells by TRAIL Many tumor cells of hemopoietic-origin are sensitive to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis .
To ascertain whether DCs can kill tumor cells via TRAIL , we first screened for TRAIL-sensitive tumor cell lines in a variety of tumor cells of hemopoietic origin as measured by the MTT reduction assay .
As shown in Fig .
2 , HL60 cells and Reh cells were highly sensitive to TRAIL-mediated growth inhibition .
Obvious cellular debris of HL6O0 cells or Reh cells was observed under the microscope ( data not shown ) .
However , no obvious growth inhibition of other tumor cells , including Jurkat cells , Daudi cells , and U937 cells , was observed under the indicated range of TRAIL concentrations , which was inconsistent with previous reports ( 33 ) .
Thus , in our system , HL6O0 cells and Reh cells were determined as the TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells for the following experiments .
Involvement of TRAIL in the cytotoxicity of IFN-B-stimulated DCs against HL6O cells and Reh cells CD4 *T cells , NK cells , macrophages , and CD11¢ ' DCs can kill some tumor cells via TRAIL under certain conditions ( 19 , 26 , 27 , 37 , 38 ) .
To investigate whether CD34DCs or MoDCs cultured in vitro have similar cytotoxic capacity , and if so whether they use TRAIL to perform this function , we first evaluated the susceptibility of the two TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of CD34DCs or MoDCs .
As shown in Fig .
3 A , unstimulated MoDCs or LPS-stimulated MoDC 's did not have obvious cytotoxicity to HL6O cells at the E : T ratios used .
However , IFN-B could markedly potentiate MoDCs to kill HL60 cells .
Unstimulated and LPS-stimulated MoDCs could kill Reh cells only at a high E : T ratio ( 20:1 ) , whereas IFN-B-stimulated MoDCs could induce obvious death of Reh cells at all E : T ratios ( Fig .
3B ) .
Similarly , only after IFN- $ stimulation could CD34DCs efficiently kill HL6O cells at an E : T ratio of 20:1 and Reh cells at all E : T ratios , as compared with unstimulated and LPS-stimulated ( Fig .
3 , C and D ) .
Thus , IFN-B could significantly enhance the cytotoxicity of CD34DCs or MoDCs .
Having ascertained that IFN- $ B can up-regulate TRAIL expression on DCs , and to confirm whether up-regulation of TRAIL was responsible for the enhanced cytotoxicity of CD34DCs or MoDCs 60 © 3 E -+- HL60 c -a- U937 2 '= .

Most apoptosis-inducing ligands ( CD95L , TRAIL , TNF-a ) can induce apoptosis through activation of the caspase cascade .
Caspase-8 is an apical member of the caspase cascade , the activation of which can induce activation of downstream caspases .
Caspase-3 activation is thought to contribute to cleavage of downstream substrates such as poly- ( ADP lamins , and actins , leading to a series of apoptotic events , such as DNA fragmentation , cellular skeleton collapse , etc .
( 28 ) .
Before we investigated whether the activation of caspases was involved in the killing of HL6O cells or Reh cells by IFN-B-stimulated CD34DCs or MoDC 's , we examined the kinetic activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 in HL6O0 cells and Reh cells induced by TRAIL .
As shown in Fig .
5 , activated subunits were released from procaspase 3 and procaspase 8 after incubating for 2 h. Maximal levels of activated subunits were seen after 6 h and were maintained until 12 h in the presence of TRAIL .
After incubation with TRAIL for 24 h , activated subunits in HL6O cells or Reh cells were still detectable but at a low level .
We then pre-incubated HL6O0 cells and Reh cells with caspase-3 inhibitor for 30 min before coculture with IFN-f-stimulated CD34DCs or MoDCs and observed its effect on cytotoxicity .
As shown in Fig .
6 , A and B , the sensitivity of HL60 cells and Reh cells to the cytotoxicity of IFN-B-stimulated MoDCs or CD34DCs was significantly reduced ( p < 0.05 ) .
Thus , caspase-3 activation was clearly involved in the killing of TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells by IFN-B-stimulated MoDCs or CD34DCs .
Involvement of NF-KB activation in the sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytotoxicity of DCs TRAIL can induce not only the activation of the caspase cascade leading to apoptotic death events but also the activation of the NF- « B pathway , which is associated with the resistance of some tumor cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis .
NF- « B inhibitor can efficiently change some TRAIL-resistant tumor cells into TRAIL-sensitive cells ( 30 , 32 ) .
Because CD3A4DCs and LPS-stimulated caspase3p20 n FIGURE 5 .

kd , Kilodaltons .
« ys Caspase3p20 CIG snip somes CD34DCs did not kill HL60 cells or Reh cells efficiently , we evaluated whether they could induce death of HL60 cells or Reh cells pretreated with NF-KB inhibitor .
In this case , CD34DCs and LPS-stimulated CD34DC 's or MoDCs could easily kill HL6O cells or Reh cells after pretreatment with NF- « B inhibitor as compared to untreated groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
( Fig .
7 ) .
Therefore , the sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytotoxicity of DCs could be up-regulated by inhibition of NF- « B activation .
Discussion Our studies show that CD34DCs or MoDCs stimulated by IFN-B can efficiently kill TRAIL-sensitive HL60 cells and Reh cells .
The cytotoxicity was partially related to the up-regulation of TRAIL expression on the DCs by IFN- stimulation .
Both caspase activation and NF-KB activation were involved in the control of the sensitivity of HL6O0 cells and Reh cells to IFN-B-stimulated DC-mediated killing .
The tumoricidal activity of DCs was enhanced more markedly by stimulation of IFN- $ than LPS , which was partially associated with the up-regulation of TRAIL expression .
We do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms also contribute to the antitumor effect .
Fas ligand , TNF- @ , and nitric oxide expressed or secreted by activated DCs may play a role in the tumoricidal activity ( 15 , 43 , 44 ) .
Our data showing that TRAIL-R3-Fc is unable to completely block the killing of tumor cells induced by DCs confirm the existence of other mechanisms .
In addition , we were unable to observe whether CD34DCs or MoDCs also have the ability to kill TRAIL-resistant tumor cells , which would supply more convincing evidence that DCs use TRAIL , or other toxic molecules , or both , to kill tumor cells .
The study of Fanger et al .
revealed that the tumoricidal activity of CD11c `` DCs was TRAIL dependent , whereas that of Chapoval et al .
demonstrated that the cytostatic effect mediated by MoDCs was partially membrane-bound TNF-a specific ( 18 , 19 ) .
IFNs were discovered through their antiviral activity .
In addition , they also have far-ranging immunomodulatory effects on several kinds of immune cells such as NK cells , T cells , and macrophages to regulate host defense against infectious agents and tumor 3 4 5 102003 40 5 p w 66.2k4 C 43.0kd $ 4 ge # 949 31.0kd tuys wees # 8 '' 0 caspase8p20 ¢ 20.1kd Reh-caspase3 Reh-caspase $ 8 3 40 5 10 20 030 40 5 , mes ma * ~a -66.2kd r -66.2kd Nite s w .. , > -43.0k4 | _ oe 0 OB - -43.0kd 4 -31.0kd -31.0kd fies d -- -caspase8p20 I h @ -- 20.0kd HL6O-caspase3 HL60-caspase8 6107 '0t 4epy uo 1san8 4q [ 810 fountwrut [ 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor The Journal of Immunology cells .
IFNs induce apoptotic cell death by up-regulating the expression of a variety of apoptosis-inducing molecules ( e.g. , FasL , TRAIL ) ( 19 , 45 , 46 ) .
Moreover , type I IFNs are able to rapidly induce CD14* monocytes into short-lived and TRAIL-expressing DCs with potent functional activities ( 47 ) .
These previous data are somewhat consistent with our results , where we have shown that IFN- is capable of up-regulating TRAIL expression on immature CD34DCs and MoDCs .
There has been no relevant report of the effect of IFN- on DC-mediated tumoricidal activities to date .
Our study is the first to report that IFN-B can enhance DC-mediated tumoricidal activity partially via up-regulation of TRAIL .
The fact that type I IFNs stimulate DCs to utilize TRAIL for generating apoptotic bodies might enable subsequent cross-priming of CD8 * CTLs , indicating that type I IFNs may be powerful adjuvants to bridge innate and adoptive immunity .
In our study , we examined the killing function of immature CD34DCs and MoDCs .
To determine whether the degree of maturity correlates with cytotoxicity , we analyzed the cytotoxicity of mature DCs induced by exogenous stimuli simultaneously .
It has been confirmed that LPS , TNF-a , CD40 ligand , and IFN-y are powerful maturation factors that induce DC maturation ( 48 ) .
We selected LPS to stimulate immature DCs into mature cells .
After 12 h incubation of immature CD34DC 's and MoDCs with LPS , a mature phenotype and potent functionality ( in an MLR assay ) were observed , which suggested that the immature DC were indeed induced into mature DCs ( data not shown ) .

Thus , distinct effects of LPS and IFN-B on DC were suggested .
IFN-B seems to enhance killing function , which allows for DCs to be innate `` defense soldiers '' able to induce apoptosis , and then to take up and process apoptotic Ags .
Alternatively , LPS , as an inflammatory factor , helps to stimulate DCs into maturation and then to play conventional Ag-presenting roles .
A question remains that we were unable to answer in our system , whether the cytotoxicity of IFN-B-stimulated DCs via TRAIL was due to soluble TRAIL either secreted from DCs or cleaved from DCs by protease in the supernatants or due to the membrane-bound TRAIL on DCs .
One report has shown that DC-mediated inhibition of growth of tumors requires a cell-to-cell interaction through the use of a Transwell cell culture system ( Millipore , Bed-ford , MA ) ( 18 ) .
Caspases are a family of intracellular cysteine proteases that contribute to apoptosis .
Under most circumstances , the heterotet-ramer complex is in an inactive form but can be cleaved to release activated subunits of ~20 kDa .
The mechanisms of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis are unknown .
At least two pathways have been confirmed as regulating sensitivity to TRAIL .
One pathway participates in an apoptotic event that involves the activation of FADD-caspase cascades triggered by DR4 or DR5 .
The other pathway counteracts apoptosis and may be correlated with activation of NF- « B by DR4 , DR5 , and DCR2 .
Certain molecules have been shown to control cellular survival or death .
Among these , the most implicated is c-FLIP the gene of which is homologous to that of caspase-8 .
c-FLIP prevents caspase-8 from entering the death-inducing signal complex by binding to itself , but it is unable to perform protease activity , thus failing to deliver downstream death signals ( 28 , 34-36 ) .
The high levels of expression of c-FLIP in some TRAIL-resistant tumor cells and normal cells may explain their TRAIL-resistant properties .
In summary , whether cells are sensitive to TRAIL or not is determined not only by the net abundance of death receptors vs decoy receptors exposed to TRAIL but also by the balance of intracellular apoptotic and antiapoptotic mechanisms .
Our studies have shown that DC-mediated cytotoxicity to tumor cells via TRAIL involves the activation of caspase-3 in tumor cells and that the sensitivity of tumor cells to DC-mediated cytotoxicity was increased by inhibition of NF-KB activation in tumor cells .
Therefore , whether tumor cells in vivo are eliminated by effector arms such as T cells , NK cells , macrophages , and DC is dependent on both the function of activated effector cells under given circumstances and the genetic properties of tumor cells .
In conclusion , DCs were effective at killing TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells partially via TRAIL in an IFN-B-stimulated microen-vironment .
To date , both type I and type II IFNs have been confirmed as enabling DCs to remove tumor cells via up-regulation of TRAIL expression .
In addition , type II DC precursors ( pDC2s ) have been confirmed to be `` natural IFN-producing cells , '' which generate 200-1000 times more IFN than any other subset of PBMC on pathogenic challenge ( 49 ) .
Thus , it is possible that an innate antitumor mechanism mediated by DCs is active in vivo .
DC precursors may be stimulated to secret IFNs when they encounter spontaneous or metastatic tumor cells .
The resulting IFNs may trigger DCs to efficiently induce apoptosis of tumor cells for subsequent uptake and processing of apoptotic bodies and presentation of antigenic peptides to CD8 * CTLs .
The mechanism may also be extended to antiviral immunity , rejection of transplanta-tion , and autoimmunity , because DCs could induce apoptosis of , and then capture apoptotic Ags from , infectious cells , allogeneic transplants , or even self-tissues , which would be used to cross prime CD8 * CTLs .
Thus , DCs may be viewed as a bridge linking the innate and the adaptive immune systems .
