Prostaglandin E , ( PGE , ) , a pleiotropic immunomodulatory molecule , is observed at elevated levels during HIV-1 infection as well as during the course of other pathogenic infections .
In 1G5 , a Jurkat-derived T cell line stably transfected with a luciferase gene driven by HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , we found that PGE , markedly enhanced HIV-1 LTR-mediated reporter gene activity .
Experiments have been conducted to identify second messengers involved in this PGE , -dependent up-regulating effect on the regulatory element of HIV-1 .
In this study , we present evidence indicating that signal transduction pathways induced by PGE , necessitate the participation of cyclic AMP , protein kinase A , and Ca** .
Experiments conducted with different HIV-1 LTR-based vectors suggested that PGE , -mediated activation effect on HIV-1 transcription was transduced via both NF- « B-dependent and -independent signaling pathways .
The involvement of NF-B in the PGE , -dependent activating effect on HIV-1 transcription was further confirmed using a « B-regulated luciferase encoding vector and by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
Results from Northern blot and flow cytometric analyses , as well as the use of a selective antagonist indicated that PGE , modulation of HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter gene activity in studied T lymphoid cells is transduced via the EP , receptor sub-type .
These results suggest that secretion of PGE , by macrophages in response to infection or inflammatory activators could induce signaling events resulting in activation of proviral DNA present into T cells latently infected with HIV-1 .

27306 1 ) , the etiologic agent of AIDS ( 1 ) , leads to a progressive decline of CD4-expressing T cells resulting in impaired cellular immune functions .
This infection is influenced by a complex interplay between viral and host factors , as well as by microbial agents termed cofactors .
It has been postulated that such cofactors may be important in disease progression by enhancing cell-to-cell transmission or through up-regulation of HIV-1 expression in latently infected cells ( 2 ) .
Mycoplasma ( 3 ) , myco-bacteria ( 4 ) , viruses ( 5 , 6 ) , and the protozoan parasite Leishmania ( 7 , 8 ) may act as cofactors for the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection either by directly modulating virus replication or by inducing a more profound immunosuppressive state .
During coinfections , the inability of the host to develop an effective immune response may involve the participation of the immunosuppressive molecule PGE , an oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acid that contain a cyclopentane ring structure .
PGE , are molecules that have been shown to modulate the immune response both in vitro and in vivo ( 9 , 10 ) .
Macro-phages , follicular dendritic cells , fibroblasts , and vascular en-dothelial cells synthesize PGE , , while lymphocytes do not secrete this major product of arachidonic acid metabolism ( 11-14 ) .
A marked increase in PGE , production is generated in response to a variety of immunological stimuli including interleukin ( IL ) -1 , tumor necrosis factor- « ( TNF-a @ ) , antigen-anti-body complexes , and lipopolysaccharide ( 15 ) .
Moreover , production of PGE , has been shown to be induced by infection with several pathogens such as Leishmania donovani ( 16 ) , Leishmania major ( 17 ) , Entamoeba histolytica ( 18 , 19 ) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 20 , 21 ) , Staphylococcus epidermidis ( 22 ) , Mycobac-terium avium ( 28 ) , herpes simplex virus type 1 ( 24 ) , coxsackie virus ( 25 ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( 26 ) , and HIV-1 ( 27-30 ) .
PGE , has been implicated in decreasing T-cell proliferation , IL-2 production , and IL-2 receptor expression ( 15 , 31-35 ) .
PGE , shifts the balance of the cellular immune response away from T-helper type 1 ( Thl ) favoring a Th2 response which drives humoral responses toward the production of IgE ( 36 ) .
However , more recent findings have depicted PGE as a pleiotropic molecule that can act both negatively or positively on the immune system ( 15 ) .
An overproduction of PGE , ( as high as 10 ~* M ) is seen in a number of disorders ( e.g .
allergy , hyper-IgE syndrome , Hodgkin lymphoma , trauma , sepsis , and transplantation ) , most of which are characterized by elevated Th2 and IgE re '* The abbreviations used are : HIV-1 , human immunodeficiency vi-rus-1 ; PGE , , prostaglandin E , ; IL , interleukin ; TNF-a , tumor necrosis factor-a ; LTR , long terminal repeat ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; PHA , phytohemagglutinin ; IBMX , isobutylmethylxanthine ; BAPTA , 1,2-bis ( O-aminophenoxy ) ethane-N , N , N ' , NV ' -tetraacetic acid ; PBS , phosphate-buffered saline ; Tricine , N- [ 2-hydroxy-1 , l-bis ( hy-droxymethyl ) ethyllglycine ; PKA , protein kinase A ; CAI , carboxy-amidotriazole ; NFAT , nuclear factor of activated T cells .

As specified above , elevated levels of PGE , have also been reported in individuals infected with HIV-1 ( 27-30 ) and it has been postulated that this may contribute to the immunosuppressive state seen in such virally-infected patients ( 89 ) .
The mechanism ( s ) responsible for the enhanced prostaglandin formation is still undefined .
The initial contact between the virus particle and its target cell might represent the crucial step leading to the production of PGE , by macrophages .
This concept is supported by the finding that a significant production of endogenous PGE , is induced ( 20- to 40-fold increase ) following incubation of primary human monocytes with the HIV-1 external envelope glycoprotein gp120 ( 40 ) .
However , in sharp contrast with this report , a previous study has demonstrated that interaction between gp120 and THP-1 , a human monocytoid cell line , does not increase exogenous production of PGE , ( 39 ) .
It is important to specify that , unlike monocyte/macrophages , promonocytoid THP-1 cells are not at a terminal stage of differentiation .
In addition , a monomer form of gp120 was used in this study which might not parallel physiological conditions where gp120 is under a multimeric form ( 41 ) .
Depending on the cell type , binding of PGE , to one of its six different described receptors ( EP ; , EP ; , EP3p EP 3p EPs , and EP , ) can lead to activation of phospholipase C , phosphatidylinositol turnover , activation of adenylate cyclase via cholera toxin-sensitive Gg proteins and mobilization of intracellular Ca** ( 42 ) .
Given that HIV-1 is highly dependent on intracellular signaling machinery for its life cycle , it is therefore possible that interaction of PGE , with its surface receptor ( s ) can modulate virus replication .
A previous cellular study supports this postulate since PGE , was found to enhance HIV-1 replication in acutely infected T lymphoid cells ( 43 ) .
The primary goal of the present work was thus to investigate the putative modulatory role of PGE , on the regulatory elements of HIV-1 ( LTR ) at both biochemical and molecular levels .
For this purpose , we treated human T lymphoid cells stably and transiently transfected with different HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase reporter gene vectors with concentrations of PGE , known to be found under physiological conditions .
We then explored the intracellular second messengers participating in PGE , -mediated signaling transduction pathway ( s ) and investigated DNA-binding transcriptional factor ( s ) and cell surface receptor ( s ) implicated in the PGE , -dependent effect on HIV-1 transcription .

Modulation of HIV-1 LTR Activity by PGE , -In order to assess whether PGE , could modulate HIV-1 LTR activity , 1G5 cells ( 5 x 10 '' ) were either left untreated or treated with PHA ( 8 ug/ml ) , anti-CD3 antibody ( clone OKT3 at 1 ug/ml ) , PMA ( 20 ng/ml1 ) , and TNF-a ( 2 ng/ml : R & D systems , Minneapolis , MN ) in a final volume of 200 ul for 1 h at 37 °C .
Next , the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nM PGE , for 24 h at 37 °C .
Dose-response experiments were done using a similar number of cells , washed once in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS , pH 7.4 ) , and resuspended in 1 ml of fresh complete culture medium before incubation for 24 h at 37 °C with PGE , at final concentrations of 1 , 10 , 100 , and 1000 nM .
Kinetic experiments were done by incubating 1G5 cells with 100 nM PGE , for 2 , 6 , 8 , and 24 h. In some experiments , 1G5 cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37°C with second messenger inhibitors such as H7 , HA-1004 , BAPTA/AM , indomethacin , MDL-12,330A , and IBMX at subcytotoxic and subcytostatic concentrations prior to treatment with 100 nM PGE , for 8 h at 37°C .
The inhibitor CAI requires a pretreatment of at least 8 h for optimum inhibition and shows no acute interference with the growth properties of the cells ( 47 ) .
All experiments were performed three times and luciferase activity was evaluated for each quadruplicate samples by a modified version of a previously published procedure ( 48 ) .
Briefly , following the incubation period , 100 ul of cell-free supernatant were withdrawn from each well and 25 ul of cell culture lysis buffer ( 25 mM Tris phosphate , pH 7.8 , 2 mM dithiothreitol , 1 % Triton X-100 , and 10 % glycerol ) were added before incubation at room temperature for 30 min .
An aliquot of cell extract ( 20 pl ) was mixed with 100 ul of luciferase assay buffer ( 20 mM Tricine , 1.07 mM ( MgCO , ) , Mg ( OH ) y5H,0 , 2.67 mM MgSO , 0.1 mM EDTA , 270 um coenzyme A , 470 uM luciferin , 580 uM ATP , and 33.3 mM dithiothreitol ) and the sample was read in the counting chamber of a standard liquid scintillation counter equipped with a single-photon monitor software ( Beckman Instruments , Fuller-ton , CA ) .
Total photo-events were measured over a 30-s time lapse .
Transient Transfection by DEAE-dextran-Jurkat E6.1 ( 5 to 10 X 10° ) were first washed once in a TS buffer ( 25 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 5 mM KCl , 0.6 mM NaHPO , , 0.5 mM MgCl , , and 0.7 mM CaCl , ) and resuspended in 0.5-1 ml of TS containing 10-20 ug of the indicated plasmids and 500 ug/ml DEAE-dextran ( final concentration ) .
The cells/ TS/plasmid/DEAE-dextran mixture was incubated for 25 min at room temperature .
Thereafter , cells were diluted at a concentration of 1 X 10° per ml using complete culture medium supplemented with 100 uM chloroquine ( Sigma ) .
After 45 min of incubation at 37°C , cells were centrifuged , washed once , resuspended in complete culture medium , and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. To minimize variations in plasmid transfection efficiencies , transfected cells were pooled 24 h after transfection and were next separated into various treatment groups as follow .
Transiently transfected cells were seeded at a density of 10° cells per well ( 100 ul ) in 96-well flat-bottom plates .
Cells were left untreated or were treated with TNF-a ( 2 ng/ml ) , PHA/PMA ( 8 ug/ml and 20 ng/ml , respectively ) , and 100 nM PGE , in a final volume of 200 ul for a period of 8 h at 87°C .
Cells were then lysed and luciferase activity was assessed as described above .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay-Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously ( 49 ) .
In brief , 1GS cells ( 10° ) were either left untreated or were treated with PGE , ( 100 nM ) or TNF-a ( 2 ng/ml ) for 30 min at 37 °C .
The incubation of cells with the stimulating agents was terminated by the addition of ice-cold PBS and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the microscale preparation protocol ( 50 ) .
Sedimented cells were resuspended in 400 ul of cold buffer A ( 10 nM HEPES , pH 7.9 , 1.5 mm MgCl , , 10 nM KCl , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , and 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog 27308 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) .
After 10 min on ice , the lysate was vortexed for 10 s and the samples were centrifuged for 10 s at 12,000 x g. The supernatant fraction was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 100 ul of cold buffer B ( 20 mm HEPES-KOH , pH 7.9 , 25 % glycerol , 420 mM NaCl , 1.5 mM MgCl , , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) and incubated on ice for 20 min .
Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 X g for 2 min at 4°C and the supernatant fractions were stored at -70 °C until used .
Ten micrograms of nuclear extracts were used to perform electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Protein content was determined by the commercial BCA Protein Assay Reagent ( Pierce , Rockfold , IL ) .
Nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 15 pl of buffer of a binding solution ( 100 mm HEPES , pH 7.9 , 40 % glycerol , 10 % Ficoll , 250 mM KCI , 10 mM dithiothreitol , 5 mM EDTA , 250 mM NaCl , 2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , 10 ug of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin fraction V ) containing 1 ng of *°P-5'-end-labeled double-stranded ( dsDNA ) oligonucleotide .
Double-stranded DNA ( 100 ng ) was labeled with and T4 polynucleotide kinase in a kinase buffer ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) .
This mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and the reaction was stopped with 5 ul of 0.2 M EDTA .
The labeled oligonucleotide was extracted with phenol/chloroform and passed trough a G-50 spin column .
The double-stranded DNA oligonu-cleotide , which was used as a probe , contained the consensus NF- « B-binding site corresponding to the sequence 5'-ATGTGAGGGGACTTTC-CCAGGC-3 ' and was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc. ( Santa Cruz , Ca ) .
DNANF- « B complexes were resolved from free labeled DNA by electrophoresis in native 4 % ( w/v ) polyacrylamide gel containing 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.5 ) , 200 nM glycine , and 1 mM EDTA .
The gel was subsequently dried and autoradiographed .
Northern Blot Analysis-Total RNA was extracted by the Trizol method ( 51 , 52 ) from 1G5 and Jurkat E6.1 cells .
Fifteen micrograms of total RNA were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gel ( 1 % agarose , 1 X formaldehyde gel buffer MOPS , pH 7.0 , 40 mM sodium acetate , 5 mM EDTA , 2.2 M formaldehyde ) .
RNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes ( Amersham ) by capillary action using 10 X SSC ( 8 M NaCl , 0.3 M sodium citrate ) .
RNA was fixed to the membrane by UV exposure and hybridized with radiolabeled probes for the EP receptors ( EP , , EP , , EP , , and EP , ) at 42 °C in 50 % formamide , 5 X SSPE , 5 X Denhardt 's solution , 0.5 % SDS , 100 ug/ml denatured fragmented salmon sperm DNA .

Cell lines 1G5 and Jurkat 66.1 ( 5 X 10° ) were washed once in PBS containing 2 % fetal bovine serum ( PBS pH 7.4 + 2 % fetal bovine serum ( PBSA ) ) .
Cells were then resuspended in 100 ul of PBSA to which was added 0.5 ug of polyclonal rabbit anti-hEP , antibody , vortexed gently , and incubated for 80 min on ice .
Cells were subsequently washed with PBSA and resuspended in 100 pul of PBSA containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled chicken anti-rabbit IgG antibody ( 0.5 ug total ) and further incubated for 30 min on ice .
Cells were finally centrifuged and resuspended in 1 % paraformal-dehyde in PBS before being analyzed by flow cytometry ( EPICS XL , Coulter Corp. , Miami , FL ) .
Experiments with the EP , Receptor-specific Antagonist AH 23848B-Assays with AH 28848B were performed by incubating 1G5 cells with 30 um AH 23848B for 1 h at 37 °C ( 58 ) .
After this pretreatment , cells were incubated with 100 nM PGE , for 8 h at 37 °C .
Experiments were performed three times and luciferase activity was monitored as described above .
RESULTS Modulation of HIV-1 LTR-driven Gene Expression in T Cells by PGE , -In order to assess whether PGE , could affect the regulatory elements of HIV-1 , we initially set out a dose-response experiment which was performed with PGE in a 24-h incubation period .
The results showed a steady increase of HIV-1 LTR activity in 1G5 cells starting at as little as 1 nm concentration of PGE , ( Fig .
1A ) .
In these experiments , PGE , was reconstituted in absolute ethanol to get a stock solution of 1 mm which was serially diluted in complete culture medium to get our working dilutions ( 1 , 10 , 100 , and 1000 nx ) .
Incubation of 1GS5 cells with the concentration of ethanol corresponding to the one used with 1000 nm PGE , resulted in a 1.5-fold increase of HIV-1 LTR dependent activity , while no effect was seen with the equivalent ethanol concentration for 100 nM PGE , ( data not Activation of HIV-1 LTR Activity by PGE , A 10 7.5 7 J .

Dose-dependent and kinetic analyses of PGE , -mediated positive effect on HIV-1 LTR activity .
A , 1G5 cells were stimulated for 24 h with increasing doses of PGE , ( 1 , 10 , 100 , and 1000 nM ) .
Cell lysates were evaluated for luciferase activity by scintillation count .
B , 1G5 cells were either left untreated ( 0 ) or were stimulated with 100 nM PGE , ( ® ) for different time periods ( 2 , 6 , 8 , and 24 h ) prior to monitoring luciferase activity in cell lysates .
Results shown are the means ( +8.D . )

shown ) .
Therefore , subsequent experiments were carried out using 100 nm PGE , to avoid any putative influence of ethanol on PGE , -mediated enhancement of HIV-1 LTR activity .
Kinetics analyses were next performed to determine the optimal incubation time for this PGE , -mediated HIV-1 LTR-driven activation .
The maximal positive effect of PGE , was seen 8 h after the initiation of treatment ( fold enhancement of 7.4 ) ( Fig .
1B ) .
Although this type of kinetic might be reminiscent of degradation of PGE , , it is unlikely since similar kinetic of time-depend-ent HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase activity were measured with activators such as TNF-a , PHA , and PMA ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , preincubation of PGE , in complete culture medium for 24 h at 37°C resulted in equal fold-induction of HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase activity in 1G5 cells as compared with incubation with fresh PGE , ( data not shown ) , which demonstrates that PGE , is fairly stable under these experimental conditions .
Taken together , these data indicate that activation of HIV-1 regulatory elements by PGE , was rapid and transient , thereby suggesting that the effect was direct and was resulting from PGE , -mediated signal transduction events .
Given that PGE , is generally seen as a down-modulator of T-cell activation , we were next interested in determining the action of PGE , on typical pathways known to lead to HIV-1 LTR activation in T cells .
1G5 cells were hence stimulated with various HIV-1 LTR activators in the absence or the presence of PGE , for 8 h. These stimuli were shown , as expected , to act as potent inducers of HIV-1 LTR activity ( fold increase over un- 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog Activation of HIV-1 LTR Activity by PGE , Luciferase activity ( cpm x 106 ) T < ad < 5 Treatment : % E h E g C © & Fic .

Activation of HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase activity by several stimuli in the absence or presence of PGE , .
1G5 cells were either left untreated ( control ) or treated with PHA ( 3 pg/ml ) , OKT3 ( 1 ug/ml ) , PMA ( 20 ng/ml ) , or TNF- @ ( 2 ng/ml ) in the absence ( 0 ) or presence ( ® ) of 100 nM PGE , for 8 h. Cell lysates were evaluated for luciferase activity by scintillation count .

treated 1G5 cells : PHA , 20.8 : OKT3 , 16.8 ; PMA , 76.4 ; and TNF -a « , 17.7 ) ( Fig .
2 ) .
Again , a marked up-regulation of HIV-1 LTR-dependent luciferase activity was also seen when 1G5 cells were incubated with PGE , alone ( 10.9-fold increase over untreated 1G5 cells ) .
A PGE , -mediated activating effect on HIV-1 LTR was also present with all stimuli used in this set of experiments ( fold increase over 1G5 cells treated with each stimuli in the absence of PGE : PHA , 1.8 ; OKT3 , 2.3 ; PMA , 1.2 ; and TNF-a , 4.3 ) .
It was thus apparent that PGE , specifically synergized with TNF-a in activating HIV-1 LTR activity .
These results clearly indicated that PGE , could further increase the overall positive effect mediated by various HIV-1 LTR-activat-ing agents and thus confirmed that PGE , could be considered by itself as a potent inducer of HIV-1 LTR transcription in T cells .
The biosynthesis of prostaglandins is known to be regulated at two different levels .
The arachidonic acid , the precursor form , is stored in membrane phospholipids prior to its release into cells by phospholipase A ; .
Free arachidonic acid is then metabolized by cyclooxygenase to an intermediate that leads to the formation of prostaglandins ( 54 ) .
To exclude any effect by endogenous PGE , in our studies , 1GS cells were pretreated with concentrations of indomethacin sufficient to inhibit cy-clooxygenase-1 ( 0.4 , 0.8 , 2.0 , and 10.0 um ) and cyclooxygen-ase-2 ( 150 um ) ( 55 ) before stimulation with PGE , for 8 h. No changes in PGE , -dependent increase in HIV-LTR driven luciferase activity could be detected with indomethacin suggesting that activation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression was only due to exogeneous PGE , ( data not shown ) .
Signaling Events Involved in PGE , -mediated Enhancement of HIV-1 LTR Activity-Our results so far suggested that binding of PGE , to its cell surface receptors ( EPs ) triggers signal transduction that positively affect HIV-1 LTR expression .
Several specific inhibitors were used to identify cellular element ( s ) participating to the signaling events involved in the PGE , -induced effect on HIV-1 transcription .
1GS5 cells were first pretreated with H7 , a selective serine/threonine kinase inhibitor that can inhibit protein kinase A ( PKA ) ( K ; = 3.0 um ) , PKC ( K ; = 6.0 uM ) , as well as PKG ( K ; = 5.8 um ) ( 56 ) .
A dose-dependent inhibition of PGE , -mediated HIV-1 LTR activation was seen when 1GS cells were pretreated with H7 at concentrations sufficient to inhibit all of these enzymes ( Fig .
34 ) .
To more deeply scrutinize signaling molecule ( s ) implicated in PGE , -induced positive effect on HIV-1 LTR activity , cells were 27309 next pretreated with HA-1004 , a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor that preferentially inhibits PKA ( K ; = 2.3 ux ) and PKG ( K ; = 1.3 uM ) over PKC ( K ; = 40.0 um ) ( 56 ) .
The PGE , -mediated activation of HIV-1 transcription was almost completely abrogated by a pretreatment with HA-1004 at concentrations sufficient to inhibit both PKA and PKG , but not PKC ( 1 and 5 pum ) ( Fig .
3B ) .
To clearly discriminate between PKA and PKG in the PGE , -induced signaling cascade , 1G5 cells were pretreated with a specific inhibitor of adenylate cyclase ( MDL-12 , 330A ) ( 57-59 ) .
Activation of HIV-1 LTR-mediated reporter gene expression by PGE , was totally abolished by concentrations of MDL-12,330A sufficient to completely inhibit cAMP activity ( Fig .
3C ) .
Results from these experiments hence demonstrated that PKA was an essential intracellular second messenger participating in the PGE , -dependent up-regulating effect on HIV-1 LTR activity in T cells .
Adenylate cyclase transforms adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) in cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) , which is necessary for PKA activity .
Knowing that PKA activation is negatively modulated by phosphodiesterase due to transformation of cAMP to 5'-AMP , cells were pretreated with IBMX , an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase activity ( 60 ) .
It is hence presumed that PGE , -induced activation of PKA should be sustained for longer periods of time in cells treated with IBMX thus resulting in a greater stimulation of HIV-1 LTR-dependent gene activity .
The increase in intracellular cAMP levels caused by the presence of IBMX indeed led to a dose-dependent enhancement of HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase activity in cells treated with PGE , ( Fig .
3D ) .
This PKA/cAMP -dependent activation of HIV-1 transcription is in agreement with previous studies ( 61 , 62 ) .
It should be noted that treatment of 1GS cells with IBMX alone ( 1 , 5 , and 10 px ) had no effect on HIV-1 LTR-dependent reporter gene activity ( data not shown ) .
The implication of Ca** in this process was next investigated by pretreating 1G5 cells with increasing concentrations of BAPTA/AM ( 1 , 5 , and 10 pm ) , an intracellular Ca** chelator ( 63 ) .
The capacity of PGE , to influence HIV-LTR activity was monitored as described above .
Data from this experiment suggested that Ca** '' was partly involved in this process as the maximal subcytotoxic concentration of BAPTA/AM used ( 10 uM ) could not totally eliminate PGE , -mediated activating effect on HIV-1 transcription ( Fig .
Finally a newly described inhibitor of calcium mobilization , carboxyamidotriazole ( CAI ) ( 47 ) , was used to reinforce the implication of Ca®* in the PGE , -induced activation of HIV-1 LTR .
Data obtained from this set of experiments confirmed that Ca** is indeed an important component of the PGE , -initiated signaling cascade which culminates in activation of HIV-1 LTR-dependent gene expression ( Fig .
3F ) .
Altogether , the use of specific inhibitors allowed us to demonstrate that PKA , cAMP , and Ca* '' * are all involved to some degree to PGE , -dependent positive effect on the regulatory elements of HIV-1 .
To mimic HIV-1 LTR activation in T cells , 1G5 cells were next treated for 8 h with dibutyryl-cAMP , a cAMP analog , along with the calcium ionophore , ionomycin .
Results showed that treatment of 1G5 cells with both chemical compounds was not sufficient to trigger HIV-1 LTR activity ( data not shown ) .
However , a dose-dependent significant increase in HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase activity was seen upon the addition of PMA , ionomycin , and increasing concentrations of dibutyryl-cAMP ( 25 , 50 , 100 , and 200 pum ) ( Fig .
4 ) .
It should be specified that PMA alone was strongly activating HIV-1 LTR-driven gene activity because this agent is recognized as one of the most potent activator of NF-xB ( 64 ) , a pleiotropic transcription factor complex known as a good inducer of HIV-1 expression ( 65 ) .

Identification of second messengers implicated in PGE , -mediated up-regulation of HIV-1 LTR activity .
1G5 cells were incubated for 1 h with H7 ( 1 , 5 , 10 , and 20 uM ) ( panel A ) , HA-1004 ( 1 , 5 , 10 , and 20 pM ) ( panel B ) , MDL-12,330A ( 50 , 100 , and 250 uM ) ( panel C ) , IBMX ( 1 , 5 , and 10 pM ) ( panel D ) , BAPTA/AM ( 1 , 5 , and 10 pM ) ( panel E ) , and for 16 h with CAI ( 0.1 , 1.0 , and 10 uM ) ( panel F ) prior to treatment for 8 h with 100 nM PGE , .
Cell lysates were evaluated for luciferase activity by scintillation count .
Results shown are the means ( * S.D . )
of four determinations and are expressed as fold induction relative to basal luciferase activity in untreated control cells ( considered as 1 ) .
These results are representative of three independent experiments .
HIV-1 LTR activity requires the activation of the transcription factor NF- « B in addition to cAMP- and calcium-dependent signaling pathways .
NF- « B-dependent and -independent Signaling Pathways Are Involved in Activation of HIV-1 LTR by PGE , -To define the region ( s ) required for the activation of HIV-1 LTR transcription by PGE at the molecular level , the parental Jurkat E6.1 cell line was transiently transfected with different HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase constructs carrying either the full-length ( pLTR-LUC ) or modified versions of the HIV-1 LTR promoter ( pme « BLTR-LUC and p « B-TATA-LUC ) .
These latter constructs either contained the complete regulatory elements of HIV-1 mutated at the two NF- « B-binding sites ( pm « BLTR-LUC ) or the minimal HIV-1 « B region and a TATA box ( p « B-TATA-LUC ) .
Transiently transfected Jurkat E6.1 cells were then stimulated with TNF-a , PHA/PMA , or PGE , for 8 h. In these experiments , stimulation with TNF-a and PHA/PMA were used as positive controls since TNF- « is known to activate HIV-1 transcription exclusively via NF- « B ( 66 ) , while the combination of PHA and PMA can enhance HIV-1 LTR activity via both NF- « B-dependent and -independent signaling pathways ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .
5A , we observed a 13.7- , 83.3- , and 12.1-fold increase in luciferase activity for the full-length HIV-1 LTR ( pLTR-LUC ) in the presence of TNF - « , PHA/ PMA , and PGE , respectively .
With the molecular construct pm « BLTR-LUC , as expected , no increase in HIV-1 LTR-driven gene activity was detected with TNF- @ , while PHA/PMA was still inducing HIV-1 LTR-dependent luciferase activity ( 8.5-fold increase ) .
Interestingly , the luciferase-encoding vector mutated at both NF- « B-binding sites of the LTR was still responding to PGE , , although at a slightly lower level compared with the wild-type HIV-1 LTR construct ( 8.8- versus 12.1-fold ) .
This experiment was repeated several times and gave consistent results .
Therefore , data from experiments conducted with pLTR-LUC and pm « BLTR-LUC were indicating that PGE , -mediated positive effect on HIV-1 LTR-driven activity required both NF- « B-dependent and -independent signal transduction pathways .

transfected with p « B-TATA-LUC .
It should be specified that this vector allows monitoring of HIV-1 activation almost exclusively via NF- « B-dependent mechanism .
Indeed , this vector is made of the minimal HIV-1 NF- « B-binding domains and a TATA box driving the luciferase reporter gene ( 46 ) .
In this case , a 15.4-fold increase in HIV-1 LTR-dependent reporter gene activity was seen in cells treated with PGE , thereby confirming that NF- « B is directly involved in the PGE , -dependent activating effect on the regulatory elements of HIV-1 .
To further substantiate the participation of NF- « B in PGE , -mediated up-regulation of HIV-1 LTR transcription , Jurkat E6.1 were transiently transfected with pNF- « B-LUC , a vector made of five consensus binding sites for NF-xB , prior to incubation with PGE , .
The implication of NF- « B in the PGE , -mediated activating effect on HIV-1 transcription was again clearly shown using this « B-driven reporter gene construct ( 17.5-fold increase ) ( Fig .
5B ) .
The involvement of NF- « B was also examined by mobility shift assays .
Results shown in Fig .
6 revealed the presence of a band specific for NF- « B that is induced following the treatment for 1 h with either PGE , or TNF-a ( Zanes 3 and 4 , respectively ) .
The specific band for NF- « B was eliminated by competition experiment with unlabeled probe for NF- « B .
These results were thus reinforcing the notion that PGE , is up-regulating HIV-1 LTR dependent activity also through a NF- « B-dependent mechanism .
It has recently been reported that the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) can synergize with NF- « B and the viral transactivating protein Tat in transcriptional activation of HIV-1 following its binding to the NF- « B binding sequences ( 67 ) .
We therefore evaluated the putative implication of NFAT in the PGE , -induced up-regulation of HIV-1 LTR activity .
Using a molecular construct made of the luciferase reporter gene placed under the control of the minimal IL-2 promoter containing three tandem copies of the NFAT -binding site , we observed that transiently transfected Jurkat E6.1 cells showed no induction of luciferase activity by the addition of In contrast , a marked increase in reporter gene activity was observed in cells treated with a combination of PMA/PHA ( data not shown ) .
We could conclude from these data that the transcription factor NFAT was not playing a role in the activation of HIV-1 LTR transcription .

These results are representative of three independent experiments .
Previous cDNA cloning and pharmacologic experiments have identified six different PGE , receptors ( EPs ) ( 68 ) .
Northern blot analyses were then performed to evaluate PGE , receptor ( s ) expression on the T lymphoid cell lines used in the present study .
The cDNAs for hEP , , hEP ; , hEP ; , and hEP , were hybridized with total RNA from 1G5 and Jurkat E6.1 cells .
Results indicated that the hEP , gene was expressed on both 1GS5 and Jurkat E6.1 cell lines , while EP ; , EP ; , and EP ; subtype receptors were not expressed ( data not shown ) .
Flow cytometry analysis was also carried out with a polyclonal antibody specific for EP , receptor and confirmed its presence on the surface of Jurkat E6.1 ( Fig .
7A ) and 1G5 ( Fig .
7B ) cells .
The identity of the prostaglandin receptor on T lymphoid 1G5 cells was directly addressed using a subtype selective pharmacologic antagonist .
For this purpose , 1G5 cells were pretreated with AH 23848B ( 30 uM ) , a selective antagonist of human EP , receptor , prior to the addition of PGE .
AH 23848B was found to abrogate PGE , -mediated up-regulation of HIV-1 LTR activity in 1G5 cells ( Fig .
8 ) .
Altogether these results indicate that the hEP , receptor is involved in the PGE , -mediated activating effect on HIV-1 transcription in T lymphoid cells .

DISCUSSION Immune and inflammatory responses are triggered by microorganisms such as bacteria , viruses , and protozoan , all known to be potential opportunistic pathogens in HIV-1-posi-tive patients .
The formation and production of elevated levels of inflammatory mediators such as PGE , is a hallmark of the HIV-1 infection ( 28-80 ) .

Next , luciferase activity was monitored as described under `` Experimental Procedures . ''
Results shown are the means ( + S.D . )
of four determinations and are expressed as fold induction relative to basal luciferase activity in untreated control cells ( considered as 1 ) .
These results are representative of three independent experiments .
phage activation .
Although it was thought that PGE , is primarily an immunosuppressive molecule that acts as a down-regulator of many aspects of B- and T-cell function and proliferation , recent findings support a role for PGE , as a potentiator of immunoglobulin class switching and cytokine and cytokine receptor synthesis ( 15 ) .
This PGE , -dependent positive effect on the immune response and the observation that higher levels of PGE , are detected in HIV-1-infected individuals ( 2-5-fold increase ) have been the compelling force for our investigation .
Knowing that PGE , is a good inducer of cAMP and that a 4-fold increase in intracellular levels of cAMP is seen in asymptomatic HIV-l-seropositive subjects as compared with uninfected controls ( 69 ) , it was thus of prime importance to study the putative effect of PGE , on the regulatory elements of HIV-1 .
We therefore asked whether the proinflammatory PGE , molecule had the ability to modulate HIV-1 transcription in T cells .
This particular cell type was chosen since T cells are considered to be a major cellular reservoir for HIV-1 in the human peripheral blood ( 70 ) .
In this report , we present evidence indicating that PGE up-regulates HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter gene expression in human T cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
Our results are indicative of an optimal signal after 6 to 8 h of treatment .
This is very similar to time kinetics of HIV-1 LTR activation by PMA , PHA , and TNF-a agents which directly act on the HIV-1 promoter .
Although we can not refute a possible indirect mechanism for HIV-1 LTR activation by PGE , which would involve production of cytokines , time course experiments suggested that a more direct process might be at the basis of the effect of PGE , on HIV-1 LTR .
Interestingly , a specific synergistic HIV-1 LTR activation was observed using both PGE , and TNF - « ( Fig .
2 ) .
This might be accounted by the fact that the effect exerted by TNF-a « is exclusively via NF-KB , while PGE , acts also on region ( s ) other than NF-B in the HIV-1 LTR ( see below ) .
Previously described synergistic activation by NF- « B and other factors have been reported ( 66 , 67 ) .
The induction of HIV-1 LTR activity by PGE , thus support a previous cellular study showing a 2.5-fold increase in virus production following the addition of exogeneous PGE , to MT-4 cells acutely infected with HIV-1 ( 43 ) .
In the present study , the involvement of specific intracellular second messengers in PGE , -mediated up-regulation of HIV-1 LTR activity has been dissected using several signal transduction inhibitors .
Experiments with indomethacin , a potent inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase pathway and thus of PGE , pro 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g wo ; popeoumog Activation of HIV-1 LTR Activity by PGE , duction , suggest that only exogeneous PGE , plays a role in the activation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression .
These results were expected based on studies that T cells had a limited capacity to metabolize arachidonic acid to prostaglandins ( 71-73 ) .
An earlier report indicated that interaction between PGE , and an adenylate cyclase-coupled stimulatory receptor leads to activation of adenylate cyclase , hydrolysis of ATP , enhanced turnover of intracellular cAMP , and binding to PKA ( 74 ) .
Our findings are clearly supportive of this signaling cascade since we found that PGE , -induced enhancement of HIV-1 LTR dependent activity requires the participation of adenylate cyclase , cAMP , and protein kinase A ( Fig .
3 , A-D ) .
Using MT-4 cells , another group has shown that elevation of cAMP levels resulted in HIV-1 replication ( 62 ) .
It is also well known that cAMP-dependent pathways regulate the immune effector functions of lymphocytes and macrophages .
For example , during immune response , cAMP exhibits positive regulatory effects at low concentrations whereas inhibitory effects are seen at high concentrations ( 75 ) .
Many of the earlier studies have shown that PGE , interaction with T cells in vitro resulted in an elevation of the cAMP level ( 35 ) and that such elevated intracellular cAMP levels were responsible for the proliferative disturbances in T cells ( 76-78 ) .
Data from our experiment with the calcium chelator BAPTA/AM and the calcium inhibitor CAI are suggestive of the importance of Ca** in the PGE , -induced activation of HIV-1 transcription ( Fig .
3 , E and F ) .
However , given that there is no published report indicating Ca** influx through the EP , receptor , our results with BAPTA/AM and CAI , two inhibitors of intracellular calcium mobilization , lead us to postulate that PGE , could generate calcium release from intracellular storage organelles .
All these results were supported by data shown in Fig .
4 indicating that up-regulation of HIV-1 LTR requires the implication of cAMP and calcium , as well as the participation of the NF- « B transcription factor .
Several agents known as potent activators of HIV-1 transcription ( e.g .
PMA , PHA , TNF-a , and anti-CD3 antibody ) are all acting through a common mechanism , namely via the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-kB which binds to the enhancer region of the HIV-1 LTR ( 79 ) .
This transcription factor is sequestered in the cytoplasm due to its physical association with the inhibitor named IxB .
NF-KB is a pleiotropic transcription factor that controls the expression of a wide variety of genes , including cytokines such as IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , interferon- $ , and TNF-a @ , as well as known genes for some cell adhesion molecules including ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 .
Its importance in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression has been stated in numerous studies ( 80 ) .
Results from mobility shift assays suggest that the PGE , -mediated effect on HIV-1 LTR activity is due to activation of the transcription factor NF- « B by PGE , .
This is in agreement with the previous demonstration that PGE , activates NF- « B in the macrophage-like cell line J774 ( 81 ) .
The fact that we have noticed that both NF- « B and Ca** are key elements in the PGE , effect on HIV-1 transcription is of interest considering that calcineurin , a Ca**/ calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase , has been reported to activate NF- « B through the inactivation of IxB ( 82 ) .
Moreover , researchers had earlier found that cAMP-mediated enhancement of PKA might be involved in the dissociation of IxB from NF- « B ( 79 ) .
Recent studies have revealed that NF- « B is regulated through phosphorylation of the p65 subunit by PKA which is directly regulated by intracellular levels of cAMP ( 83 ) .
Our experiments hence support the notion that PGE , might be activating the transcription factor NF- « B via cAMP/PKA and calcium signaling pathways in human T lymphoid cells .
However , our experiments were performed with « B-driven reporter gene constructs ( p « B-TATA-LUC and pNF- 27313 « kB-LUC ) and HIV-1 LTR-based vectors ( pLTR-LUC and pm « BLTR-LUC ) , furthermore , suggest that NF- « B-binding regions and another element ( s ) in the HIV-1 LTR are involved in the activation of HIV-1 LTR-dependent transcription induced by PGE , , .
NFAT is an immediate-early activation factor that plays a crucial role in T-cell activation and commitment processes through its control of IL-2 gene activation ( 84 ) .
Based on the demonstrated synergistic effect between NFAT and NF- « B on the activation of HIV-1 transcription ( 67 ) and the proposed PGE , -induced NF- « B-independent pathway , we looked at the putative role of NFAT in the effect of PGE .
We found that NFAT was not involved in PGE , -dependent activation of HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase activity .
These data were expected considering that PGE , has been reported to inhibit NFAT activity ( 85 ) .
PGE , could have the capacity to modulate several signal transduction pathways through its effect on transcription factors regulated by cAMP such as the cAMP response-element binding factor , the activating protein-1 ( 38 ) , and Spl ( 86 ) .
The involvement of these three transcription factors in the observed NF- « B-independent activation of HIV-1 LTR mediated by PGE , is currently under investigation .
Finally , by Northern blot assays , flow cytometric analyses , and pharmacological studies , we demonstrated that studied T lymphoid cell lines ( Jurkat E6.1 and 1G5 ) express the EP , receptor subtype on their surfaces and that EP , , EP , , and EP ; , receptors seem not to be expressed ( Figs .
7 and 8 and data not shown ) .
This finding is in accord with previous studies that have found by Northern blot analysis that the EP , gene is expressed on T lymphoid cells such as Molt-4 , KM-3 , and Jurkat E6.1 ( 87-89 ) .
It has been demonstrated that EP , receptors are coupled to adenylate cyclase via a stimulatory G protein ( G. , ) and that such activation results in an enhancement of intracellular cAMP levels ( 53 , 68 ) .
Interestingly , PGE , has been shown to lead to an increase in intracellular cAMP levels partly via the EP , receptor ( 90 ) , a finding which lend credence to the potential implication of the EP , receptor in the PGE , -induced up-regulation of HIV-1 LTR activity .
Because of their intrinsic intracellular obligatory parasitic form of life , viruses depend heavily on cell metabolic machinery for their replication .
Thus , changes in cellular metabolism might influence the viral life cycle .
The experiments reported here highlight the positive action of PGE , a powerful cAMP-inducing agent , on the regulatory elements of HIV-1 .
The presented data suggest that elevated levels of PGE , detected in HIV-1-infected persons or induced by opportunistic pathogens might actively participate to immunological disturbances associated with AIDS and modify the pathogenesis of this retroviral disease by inducing a higher viral load .
Finally , high concentrations of PGE , ( up to 100 pmt ) found in seminal fluids of HIV-l-infected persons might directly enhance virus replication and facilitate viral transmission during sexual activities ( 40 ) .
