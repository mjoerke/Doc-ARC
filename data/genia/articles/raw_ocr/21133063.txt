By using these com-pounds , we investigated whether distinct RAR-dependent and RXR-dependent pathways operate to mediate the diverse activities of retinoids , particularly , the effects of the RXR pathway on cellular function .
ER-27191 completely antagonized HL60 cell differentiation induced by al/-trans-retinoic acid ( atRA ) .
However , the differentiation induced by the ER-35795 was not antagonized at all by the RAR antagonist , but was inhibited by an RXR homodimer antagonist ( LGD100754 , ( 25,4£,6Z ) -7- ( 3-n-propoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyInaphthalen-2-yl ) -3-methylocta-2,4,6-trienoic acid ) .
Its agonistic action on RXR/RAR heterodimer , on the other hand , was neutralized by the RAR antagonist .
During HL60 cell differentiation , atRA induced mRNA , while the RXR had no effect .
Interestingly , a functional RXR-pathway was also seen in lipopolysaccharide-induced inhibition of mouse splenocyte proliferation .
These results strongly suggest the existence of a pharmacological RXR-dependent pathway that is activated by a ligand that can bind to RXR .
Keywords : Retinoic acid receptor , Retinoid X receptor , ER-27191 , ER-35795 , HL60 differentiation Research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of transactivation via RAR and RXR , members of the nuclear receptor family , is advancing rapidly .
atRA is known as a multifunctional physiological regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation ( reviewed in refs .
1-3 ) .
Because atRA binds only to RARs , the biological activities induced by atRA are thought to be mediated via RARs , On the other hand , ICRA , an isomer of atRA , was identified as a ligand of RXR ( 4 , 5 ) .
Since IcRA can bind not only to RXR , but also to RAR ( 4-6 ) , the mechanisms of its actions appear to be complicated .
Many nuclear receptors activate transcription by forming *Corresponding author .
- FAX : +81-298-47-2037 E-mail : t-hida @ hhc.eisai.co.jp heterodimers with RXR in the presence of a specific ligand .
During heterodimer activation , RXR was thought to be a silent promiscuous partner .
Recent findings showed that RXR ligands can enhance heterodimer formation with a counter receptor , such as RAR or PPAR ( 7 , 8 ) .
It has also been demonstrated that the function of the heterodimer was modified by RXR ligands ( 9 ) and that IcRA can activate heterodimer formation of some orphan receptors with RXR ( 9-11 ) .
In any case , the cellular pathway induced by RXR ligands as well as the participation of IcRA in physiological nuclear receptor signaling is still unclear .
To better understand the cellular mechanisms that depend on RXR , many RXR-selective compounds were syn-thesized .

RXR Pathway in Cellular Function 61 differentiation ( 12 , 13 ) , induction of apoptosis ( 14 ) , inhibition of cytokine production ( 15 ) and lowering blood glucose level in diabetes models ( 7 , 16 ) .
It was often observed that RXR ligands show different effects from the ligand of the counter receptor ; these ligands are referred to as rexi-noids , which are particularly distinguished from retinoids .
In addition , transgenic mouse experiments showed a role of an RXR-selective signal in the development of the spinal cord ( 17 ) and organ formation in embryos ( 18-20 ) .
Re-cently , evidence suggesting the existence of an RXR-spe-cific , non-silent , pathway is increasing .
A clarification concerning IcRA and/or synthetic ligand in the RXR pathway will therefore be helpful to understand the physiological functions of RXR .
In this study , we clarified the distinct RAR-dependent and RXR-dependent pathways in the functional differentiation of the HL60 cell and in the inhibition of normal B cell proliferation by using natural and synthetic RXR agonists in combination with an RXR homodimer antagonist and an RAR antagonist .
We describe here the existence of an RXR-dependent pharmacological pathway which is activated by a ligand that can bind to RXR .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals Unlabeled atRA was purchased from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO , USA ) .
PHJatRA and [ PH ] I9cRA were purchased from DuPont/NEN ( Boston , MA , USA ) .
The method for synthesis of ER-27191 and ER-35795 was reported previously ( 21 , 22 ) .
Retinoid compounds used here were synthesized in our laboratories .
These retinoids were dissolved in DMSO to prepare 10 mM stock solutions , which were diluted in buffer or culture medium to give a final DMSO concentration not exceeding 0.1 % .
Binding assay To estimate binding affinity to receptors , RAR-expressing stable transformants ( derived from baby hamster kidney cell ) were established , and the method of nuclear extract preparation and binding assay were described previously ( 22 ) .
Briefly , a 180-wl aliquot of nuclear extract was incubated with 10 wl of 10 nM [ PHJatRA or 15 nM [ PH ] I9cRA and 10 l of various concentrations of unlabeled compounds in a 96-well polypropylene plate .
The plate was incubated for 16 h at 4°C , then 50 wl/well of a charcoal /dextran suspension ( 3 % Norit A / 0.3 % dextran in 10 mM Tris-HCI , pH7.4 , 0.02 % sodium azide ) was added for 10 min at 4°C .
The plate was centrifuged and the supernatants were subjected to liquid scintillation counting .
Binding in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ligand was defined as nonspecific binding .
Specific binding was defined as the total binding minus the nonspecific binding , and IC ; , values were obtained from logarithmic plots .
The selectivities of compounds for each receptor were indicated as relative ICs , , obtained by dividing the IC ; , value for each receptor of the compound by that of the natural ligand ( atRA or IcRA ) .
Transactivation assay To evaluate transactivation activity , receptor expression and reporter plasmids were transiently co-transfected in COS-1 cells .
For antagonist evaluation , only reporter plasmid was transfected into the RAR-expressing stable transformant cells .
The cells at 80 % confluence in a 60-mm dish were incubated with 6 wg of receptor expression vector , 6 ug of reporter plasmid , and 40 wl of Lipofectamine '' ( Gibco-BRL , Rockville , MD , USA ) per dish in OPTTI-MEM ( Gibco-BRL ) .
After 4 h of incubation , the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and incubation was continued for 20 h. The cells were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and seeded at 3 x 10° per well in 96-well plates .
After 6 h of incubation , compounds at various concentrations were added to duplicate wells .
The cells were incubated for a further 48 h , and then PLAP activity of the cell supernatants was assayed for transcriptional activity .
To inactivate nonspecific activity , the samples were preheated at 65°C for 20 min .
Aliquots of 15 ul were mixed with 60 wl of assay buffer ( 0.28 M Na ; COs ; , pH 10.0 , with 8 mM MgSQO,4 ) and reacted with 75 ul of Lumistain'® '' ( Sumitomo , Osaka ) .
After the reaction mixture had incubated for 30 min at 37°C and 30 min at room temperature , chemiluminescence was measured with a micro plate luminometer ( 23 ) .
The selectivities for each receptor were also presented as relative ED ; , .
Because in our investigation , it was found that the response to some RAR-selective compound tended to reach a plateau near 50 % of that of atRA .
Therefore , ED ; , values were used to represent the transcriptional activity for the evaluation .
HL60 culture and differentiation measurements HL60 culture and measurement of CD11b expression ( as the marker of differentiation ) were performed as previously reported ( 21 ) .
Briefly , HL60 cells ( 1 x 10°/ml ) were exposed to compounds for 5 days ; and for surface antigen analysis , the cells were harvested exposed to FITC-anti CD11b monoclonal antibody ( Immunotech , Marseille , France ) at 4°C for 1 h , and fixed with 0.2 % paraform-aldehyde .
The proportion of CD11b-positive cells in viable cells was determined with a FACScan '' ( Becton Dickin-son , San Jose , CA , USA ) .
In some cases , we also measured the magnitude of superoxide anion production from HL60 cells as a functional differentiation marker .
For measurement of superoxide production , HL60 cells treated with compounds for 5 days were stimulated with PMA ( 10 ng/ ml ) in the presence of cytochrome c ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO , 62 T. Hida et al .
USA ) for 30 min at 37°C , the change of absorbance ( OD 550 nm ) was measured , and the quantity of superoxide anion production per cell was estimated from the millimolar extinction coefficient of reduced cytochrome c as 28.0 .
Detection of RARBG mRNA induction HL60 cells exposed to compounds for 24 h were collected and washed , then total RNA was extracted with the TRIzol '' ( Gibco-BRL ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
RT-PCR was performed with an RNA-PCR kit ( Perkin Elmer , Branhburg , CA , USA ) from 0.25 ug of total RNA , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Primers used for the PCR were as follows : RARZ sense ( 1-22 ) , S-ATGTTTGACTGTATGGATGTTC-3 ; RAR } antisense ( 222-245 ) , 5-AAGCAGGGTTITGTA CACTCG-3 ' ; human P-actin ; RT-PCR Amplimer Sets ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) .
A reaction cycle consisted of 1 min at 98°C , 1 min at 57°C and 2 min at 73°C , with 22 cycles for -actin and 35 cycles for RAR3 .
A 10-wl aliquot of each reaction sample was examined on 1.5 % agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide .
Table 1 .
Spleen cell culture and proliferation assay Spleen cells were prepared from 6-week-old male BALB/C mice as reported ( 24 ) .
The spleen cells were suspended at 6 x 10°/ml in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS and 50 wM 2-mercaptoethanol ; and 0.2-ml aliquots were plated in 96-well plates and then cultured with 5 ug/ml of E. coli LPS ( Sigma ) in the presence of compound .
After 3 days of culture , the cells were pulsed with 0.5 Ci of [ H ] thymidine per well ( Amersham , Buck-inghamshire , UK ) for 6 h , then harvested on glass filters , and incorporated radioactivity was counted using a # -plate ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
RESULTS Characterization of compounds used in this study Relative binding abilities of retinoid compounds are comparably shown in Table 1 .
Namely the relative binding ability was calculated from the ratio of ICs , of a compound to that of atRA for RAR , or to that of IcRA for RXR .

RXR Pathway in Cellular Function 63 bind to RXR .
In spite of high binding affinities , transactivational activity of ER-27191 was not seen in any RAR sub-type .
On the other hand , ER-35795 , a novel synthetic retin-oid , could bind strongly to RXR with a similar affinity to IcRA and enhanced the transactivation , but did not bind to RARs .
Thus , ER-35795 was a selective agonist for RXR .
LGD100754 , reported as a RXR homodimer antagonist , was described as agonist in the case of RXR/RAR heterodimer ( 25 ) .
In this assay system , LGD100754 actually showed agonistic activity for RAR , but did not induce RXR/RXR homodimer transactivation .

1 , ER-27191 inhibited the transcriptional activities via RARs induced by both atRA and IcRA in a dose-dependent manner , but failed to inhibit the transcriptional activities via RXR induced by IcRA or ER-35795 , an RXR agonist .
In the only RAR/3 transformant , ER-27191 itself slightly increased the transactivation , but the transactivation induced by atRA or IcRA was suppressed to the level by ER-27191 .
Furthermore , the binding of PH ] 9cRA to RARs ( RAR a , RAR/3 and RAR y ) was also inhibited by ER-27191 ; however , ER-27191 had no effect on the binding of [ PH ] JI9cRA to RXR a ( data not shown ) .
These results showed that ER-27191 can completely inhibit the RAR pathway activated not only by atRA , but also by IcRA .
Thus ER-27191 is defined as a pan-antagonist for RAR .

The transformants transfected with the reporter plasmid CRBP I-PLAP ( RARa , /3 , y ) or CRBP II-PLAP ( RXR ) in receptor-expressing transformant cells .
Cells were cultured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of ER-27191 ( [ _ ] ) with 10 nM atRA ( MRD ) , 10 nM IcRA ( @ ) , or 10 nM ER-35795 ( & ) .
After 2 days of exposure , the transcriptional activity was determined by measuring the PLAP activity in the supernatant of the cell culture .
Three independent experiments were done , and representative data are shown .

HL60 differentiation induced by atRA , IcRA and RXR agonist By using the compounds characterized above , we next examined the contributions of the RAR and RXR pathways to cell function , especially those triggered by IcRA and the selective RXR agonist .
As HL60 , which only expresses RARa and RXRa , differentiate in response to atRA and IcRA ( 12 , 26-31 ) , we chose it as a model cell for our purpose .
First , the HL60 differentiation was analyzed by flow cytometry , and the percentage of CD1 1b-positive cells was determined .
In the presence of 10 nM atRA or IcRA , HL60 fully expressed CD11b ( Fig .
2A ) .
Interestingly , ER35795 , an RXR agonist , which lacks binding ability with RAR and has no inducing activity for transactivation through RARs , also increased the proportion of CD11b-positive cells in a dose-dependent manner .

( M ) RARB B-actin lane ER-35795 ( 100 nM ) | superoxide production from HL60 was measured in terms of functional cell differentiation .
Concomitantly with the differentiation of HL60 cells , proliferation was decreased ( data not shown ) .
The inhibition of proliferation and increase of CD1 1b expression were accompanied with significant elevation of superoxide anion production in response to PMA ( Fig .
2B ) .
This functional differentiation was induced by not only IcRA , but also the RXR agonist ER-35795 .
Finally it was examined whether these differentiation pathways were the same or not by observing RAR transcription .
It is known that the RXR/RAR dimer can up-regulate the mRNA directly in the presence of ligand for RAR , atRA and IcRA , because RARE exists upstream of the RAR/3 gene ( 32 - 34 ) .
Therefore , induction of RAR/ # mRNA might show that the RAR pathway would work during HL60 differentiation .

Differentiation of HL60 induced by RAR and RXR agonists .
A : Elevation of CD11b induced by RAR and RXR ligands .
HL60 cells were cultured with various concentrations of atRA ( MB ) , IcRA ( @ ) and ER-35795 ( & ) for 5 days , and the percentage of CD11b-positive cells was measured by flow cytometer .
Three separate experiments were done , and representative data are shown .
B : Cellular function induced by RAR and RXR agonists .
HL60 cells were incubated with the indicated compounds for 5 days .
The cells were stimulated by PMA and production of superoxide anion was measured in terms of reduction of cytochrome c. Data are expressed as the mean of three data points + S.E.M .
Statistical analysis was performed by Student 's t-test ( *P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance ) .
C : Induction of RAR/ # mRNA .
HL60 cells were exposed to the compound in the presence or absence of ER-27191 for 24 h. Total RNA was prepared , and RT-PCR was performed .
PCR samples were examined on 1.5 % agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide .
PCR products were detected at 269 bp for RAR/3 and 849 bp for f-actin .
Lane c : amplified from cDNA , 1 : untreated , 2 : atRA ( 1 wM ) , 3 : IcRA ( 1 M ) , 4 : ER-35795 ( 1 M ) , 5 : ER-27191 ( 3 uM ) , 6 : atRA ( 1 wM ) + ER-27191 ( 3 wM ) , 7 : IcRA ( 1 wM ) + ER-27191 ( 3 wM ) , 8 : ER-35795 ( 1 wM ) + ER-27191 ( 3 wM ) .
Three independent experiments were done , and representative data are shown .
RXR Pathway in Cellular Function 65 atRA could induce the transcription of mRNA ( Fig .
2C : lane 2 ) , and this induction was diminished by cotreatment with 3 M ER-27191 .
On the other hand , the induction of RAR/Z3 mRNA in the cells treated with 1 M IcRA ( lane 3 ) was not so prominent , even though the extent of functional cell differentiation was similar to that with 1 uM atRA .
Furthermore , ER-35795 , even at the concentration of 10 uM , failed to induce RAR,3 transcription ( lane 4 ) .
Effect of RAR and RXR antagonists on the differentiation of HL6O ER-27191 , an RAR-selective antagonist , did not itself affect the differentiation of HL60 , but suppressed the appearance of CD11b-positive cells induced by exposure to 10 nM atRA or IcRA , with similar dose dependence in each case ( Fig .
3A ) .
On the other hand , when a higher ligand concentration ( 100 nM ) was employed , ER-27191 inhibited the HL60 differentiation induced by atRA , but the inhibitory effect on the differentiation induced by IcRA was apparently diminished ( Fig .
3B ) .
As in the case of 10 or 100 nM , ER-35795 was not inhibited at all by ER-27191 ( Fig .
3B ) .
To clarify the pathways activated by each ligand , ER-27191 , an antagonist for RAR , and LGD100754 , an RXR homodimer antagonist , were used in the HL60 differentiation system .
LGD100754 was reported to have antagonist activity in RXR/RXR homodimer transactivation , but it turned into an activator of the RXR/RAR heterodimers ( 25 ) .
We found that LGD100754 partially induced CD11b expression on the HL6O0 cell surface , and this activity ( A ) 100- 1007 # p 804 so ; 3 $ = ly a 5 so .

99 % ity BJ a ubc Concentration of ER-27191 ( nM ) seemed to be mediated by RXR/RAR heterodimer activation , because it was antagonized in the presence of 1 M ER-27191 , an RAR antagonist ( Fig .
3C ) .
The RAR antagonist-resistant activities induced by the ER-35795 and by a high dose of IcRA were both inhibited by the RXR/RXR homodimer antagonist , LGD100754 , in the presence of the RAR antagonist ( Fig .
3C ) .
Thus , co-treatment of LGD100754 with RAR antagonist extracted the RXR homodimer antagonistic activity of LGD100754 in cellular response .
These data strongly suggest that two pathways exist for the induction of HL60 differentiation : 1 ) an RAR-antagonist-inhibitable RAR-dependent pathway and 2 ) an RXR-antagonist-inhibitable RXR-dependent pathway , which is RAR-independent .
Effects of retinoids on the proliferation of splenocytes Since atRA and IcRA inhibit B cell proliferation induced by LPS ( 24 , 35 ) , we investigated whether the putative RAR-dependent and RXR-dependent pathways are functional in normal cells .
As shown in Fig .
4A , atRA and IcRA both inhibited the proliferation of spleen cells .
ER-27191 , an RAR antagonist , alone did not show any inhibition up to 100 nM .
Interestingly , ER-35795 , an RXR agonist , could also inhibit the splenocyte proliferation at a concentration of 10 nM or higher .
The inhibition of B cell growth induced by 10 nM atRA or IcRA was completely reversed by 100 nM ER-27191 ( data not shown ) .
In order to know which pathway is contributing to the inhibition of ER35795 , we examined the effect of LGD100754 .

Effects of compounds on LPS-stimulated splenocyte proliferation .
A : Inhibitory effects of compounds on LPS-stimulated splenocyte proliferation .
Murine spleen cells were cultured with the indicated concentrations of atRA ( RB ) , IcRA ( @ ) , ER-35795 ( & ) or ER-27191 ( [ _ ] ) .
Two separate experiments were done , and similar results were obtained .
B : Reverse of proliferation by LGD100754 .
Cells were incubated with ER-35795 in the indicated combination of ER-27191 and LGD100754 .
Data are expressed as the mean of three data points + S.E.M .
Statistical analysis was performed by Student 's # -test ( *P < 0.05 was con sidered to indicate statistical significance ) .
with the results of the HL60 assay , LGD100754 also inhibited LPS-induced B cell proliferation , but it was reversed by ER-27191 , an RAR antagonist ( Fig .
4B ) , although inhibition of the response by 100 nM ER35795 , an RXR agonist , was not reversed by only ER-27191 and LGD100754 , but it was reversed by both antagonists in combination ( Fig .
4B ) .
DISCUSSION ER-27191 was found to be an antagonist of atRA-induced HL60 cell differentiation ( 21 , 26 ) .
In this study , ER-27191 exhibited strong binding affinity for all RAR-subtypes , while it failed to bind to RXR .
Furthermore , ER-27191 antagonized the transactivation of RAR a , # and y transformants induced by not only atRA , but also IcRA , although it can not inhibit the RXR a transactivation induced by IcRA ( Fig .
1 ) .
This antagonistic activity of ER-27191 correlated with the ability to displace [ 'HJatRA ( Table 1 ) or [ PH ] IcRA bound to RAR ( data not shown ) , suggesting that ER-27191 binds to the common region of RARs recognized by atRA and IcRA .
It is well known that atRA induces differentiation of HL60 cells to granulocytes and subsequently causes cell death by apoptosis mediated by RAR .
On the other hand , the role of RXR ligand during HL60 differentiation was thought to be a synergistic enhancer of RAR activity ( 12 ) .
However , the existence of an RAR-independent RXR path way was recently reported ; eg. , antagonist-resistant differentiation and apoptosis induced by IcRA ( 26 ) , apoptosis in HL60 cells induced by an RXR agonist ( 27 ) , and RAR-independent NB4 ( acute promyelocytic leukemia cell ) maturation ( 13 ) .
In this report , we demonstrate that RXR ligand can induce HL60 differentiation and that this may occur through an RXR pathway .
This is supported by the following findings .
First , the RXR agonist , ER-35795 , could fully induce CD11b expression ( Fig .
2A ) and cell function ( Fig .
2B ) .
This differentiation was not inhibited by ER-27191 , an RARs-selective antagonist ( Fig .
3 : A and B ) .
In addition , in the presence of the RAR antagonist , the differentiation induced by the RXR agonist was antagonized by LGD100754 , an RXR-homodimer antagonist , in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig .
3C ) .
The purpose of combining LGD100754 with RAR antagonist was to eliminate the agonistic action of LGD100754 via RXR/RAR heterodimer , as it has been reported that LGD100754 itself has RXR/RAR and RXR/PPAR agonistic activities ( 25 ) .
In fact , we observed the agonistic activity of the LGD100754 in HL60 differentiation , and found that this effect was diminished in the presence of the RAR antagonist ( Fig .
3C ) .
Thus , in the presence of an RAR antagonist , LGD100754 works as a pure RXR antagonist with no HL60 differentiation .
This is the first time that LGD100754 manifests its RXR homodimer antagonistic activity in cellular response combined with an RAR antagonist .
Second , mRNA is RXR Pathway in Cellular Function 67 known to be induced by atRA itself through RARE existing in the promoter region of the RAR/ # gene ( 32 , 33 ) .
During the differentiation of HL60 , it was found that atRA induced the transcription of RAR/ mRNA , and this induction was weakened in the presence of the RAR antagonist ( Fig .
2C : lanes 2 and 6 ) .
In contrast to atRA , the RXR agonist failed to induce transcription of RARZ3 mRNA ( lane 4 ) , even though it induced the differentiation of HL60 , again suggesting that ER-35795 , an RXR agonist , induced HL60 differentiation not through an RAR-dependent , RARE-medi-ated pathway involving induction of RAR/Z3 mRNA , but through another pathway that is not accompanied with induction of RAR/ # mRNA .
As reported by Apfel et al .
( 12 ) , HL60 differentiation was induced not only by atRA or IcRA , but also by the RXR agonist .
The report described that the RXR agonists enhanced the RXR/RAR heterodimer , even though RXR/RXR homodimer was also formed by RXR ligand on retinoid X responsive element .
In many cases , the role of RXR compound was explained by enhancement of heterodimer with RAR , PPAR and the like .
However , the results described here suggest the possibility that high concentrations of RXR agonists induce the RXR /RXR homodimer pathway .
Recently the possibility was also reported that an RAR-independent RXR signal exists in atRA-sensitive and resistant NB4 for cell maturation ( 13 ) .
Taken together , it is strongly suggested that a functional RXR pathway exists for myeloidal cell differentiation mediated by RXR homodimer .
IcRA is also known to induce HL60 differentiation ( 26 , 31 ) .
From the results shown here , IcRA bound to RXR and activated RXR -dependent transcription , supporting the idea that IcRA is a natural ligand for RXR ( 36 ) .
However , ICRA causes granulocytic differentiation of HL60 predominantly not through the RXR pathway , but rather through the RAR pathway at a dose of 10 nM or less , because the differentiation was almost completely blocked by ER-27191 , an RARs-selective antagonist .
On the other hand , the HL60 differentiation induced by a high concentration ( such as 100 nM ) of IcRA , was not antagonized by ER-27191 ( Fig .
3C ) .
It was reported that not only atRA but also ICRA could induce RAR/3 transcription ( 33 , 34 ) .
In HL60 cells , 10 nM of IcRA could induce RAR/3 transcription like atRA can ( data not shown ) ; however , induction of RAR/3 mRNA by 1 wM of IcRA was less than that by the same concentration of atRA ( Fig .
2C ) .
These results suggest that such a high concentration of IcRA might change the differentia-tion-pathway from the RAR-dependent pathway to an RXR pathway that is not functionally antagonized by ER-27191 .
In the presence of more than 100 nM IcRA , it was also reported that RXR homodimer formation was induced ( 12 ) .
From kinetic analysis , it was reported that RXR exists as a tetramer in the absence of ligand ( 37 , 38 ) .
RXR tetramer dissociates to RXR homodimer in the presence of IcRA , and subsequently RAR and cognate ligand induce RXR/ RAR heterodimer .
Since a significant fraction of the dimer remains as a RXR homodimer , it is likely that high concentration of IcRA preferably activates RXR homodimer .
In this study , as the inhibitory profile of RAR antagonist on the differentiation of HL60 induced by 10 nM or 100 nM IcRA was also quite different , it appears that the activation pathway is dramatically switched from RAR to RXR depending on the concentration of IcRA employed .
To elucidate possible involvement of an RXR pathway , we considered a similar study with splenocytes , as it was known that B cell proliferation induced by mitogens such as LPS is inhibited by atRA , mediating RAR a ( 24 ) .
It was also shown that physiological concentrations of atRA and IcRA inhibit the growth of normal human and murine B cells ( 35 ) .
As shown in Fig .
4 , the proliferative response of LPS-stimulated splenocytes was suppressed by the RXR agonist .
Thus , functional activation through the RXR pathway has been demonstrated herein by an effect on HL6O0 cell differentiation and the proliferative response of LPS-stimulated splenocyte .
In conclusion , the RXR-selective agonist induced not only RXR transactivation , but also granulocytic differentiation and inhibition of splenocyte proliferation .
These cellular functions were not antagonized by an RAR-selective antagonist , but were inhibited by an RXR-homodimer antagonist , while its agonistic action on RAR was neutralized by an RAR antagonist .
Thus , we conclude that at least some types of cells retain both an RAR-dependent pathway and an RXR-dependent pathway , both of which are functionally active .
ICRA can utilize both pathways , depending on its concentration .
Although RXR had been thought to be a silent receptor , we showed here that RXR homodimer can be activated by RXR ligands .
Further studies combining the selective activation pathway induced by RXR homodimer should provide new insights and lead to novel drug discov- ery .
