1 STAT1 Pathway Is Involved in Activation of Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus Long Terminal Repeat in Monocytes TINA SEPP anp SANDRA E. TONG-STARKSEN®* Department of Medicine , University of California-San Francisco and Veterans Administration Medical Center , San Francisco , California 94121 Received 10 July 1996/Accepted 7 October 1996 The caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus ( CAEV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is activated by gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) in promonocytic cells .
We have previously shown that a 70-bp element is necessary and sufficient for the response of the CAEV LTR to this cytokine .
At the 5 ' end , this 70-bp IFN-y response element contains sequence similarity to the gamma activated site ( GAS ) .
Here we demonstrate that the putative GAS element in the CAEV LTR binds specifically to a cellular factor induced by IFN-y in promonocytic cells .
Substitution mutations in this consensus sequence eliminate binding of the inducible factor .
The GAS element from the 70-bp motif is sufficient to confer responsiveness to IFN-y using a heterologous minimal promoter .
Consistent with the binding data , the same mutations in the GAS element eliminate responsiveness to IFN-y in the context of both a functional CAEV LTR and a heterologous promoter .
The cellular factor that binds to the GAS element is present from 5 min to 14 h after stimulation with IFN-y .
Binding of the nuclear factor to the GAS element in the CAEV LTR is inhibited by antibody directed against STAT1 ( p91/84 ) .
Thus , the GAS sequence in the CAEV LTR is essential for the response to IFN-y and a STAT1-like factor binds to this site .
The STAT-1 signaling pathway provides at least one mechanism for activation of the CAEV LTR by IFN-y in monocytes .
These data are the first demonstration of a role for a STAT family member in the regulation of a viral promoter .
Caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus ( CAEV ) causes a sym-metric , peripheral arthritis in infected adult goats ( 3 ) .
CAEV belongs to the group of nononcogenic retroviruses called len-tiviruses .
Other members of the group include human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) , HIV-2 , simian immunodeficiency virus , equine infectious anemia virus , feline T-lymphotropic virus , and visna virus ( 11 ) .
All members of this retrovirus group are species specific , have tropism for the cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage and are characterized by persistent infections in vivo .
Although production of the virus is restricted in infected monocytes , differentiation into macrophages results in increased viral expression and an associated inflammatory response .
In vivo expression and replication of the virus in tissue macrophages correlates with development of clinical disease , such as inflammatory arthritis ( 11 , 17 ) .
Several cellular signalling pathways have been shown to be involved in the regulation of lentiviral transcription in monocytes .
The HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is regulated in monocytes by nuclear factor NF-kB ( 9 ) .
Members of the ets family of proto-oncogenes , as well as NF-kB , are important for increased expression of the HIV-2 LTR during monocyte differentiation ( 15 ) .
The FOS-JUN heterodimer binds to a site for activator protein ( AP-1 ) and is involved in transcriptional activation of the visna virus LTR ( 24 ) .
The factors required for activation of the CAEV LTR have not been characterized .
Another pathway that leads to differentiation of monocytes is initiated by gamma interferon ( IFN-y ) .
This cytokine is secreted by an activated subpopulation of T cells ( Th1 ) and natural killer cells during inflammatory responses to viral infection ( 4 ) .
Signalling through the IFN-y receptor leads to * Corresponding author .

TH activation of a distinct pair of tyrosine kinases , JAK1 and JAK2 , which belong to the Janus kinase family ( 22 ) .
However , recent studies have demonstrated an additional requirement for a serine kinase and serine phosphorylation for maximal activation of transcription ( 29 ) .
The activated kinases lead to phosphorylation of a latent cytoplasmic protein , STAT1 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) .
Dimeric phosphor-ylated STAT1 translocates to the nucleus , binds to the gamma activation site ( GAS ) consensus element in IFN-y-responsive promoters , and activates IFN-y-dependent transcription of different cellular genes ( 5 , 22 , 25 ) .
We have demonstrated in a previous report that the CAEV LTR is activated by stimulation of monocytes with IFN-y .
A 70-bp region is necessary and sufficient for the IFN-y response in the promonocytic cell line U937 ( 26 ) , and we call this region the CAEV 70-bp interferon response element ( 70-bp IRE ) .
A variety of agents , including IFN-y , can be used to induce differentiation of these cells into a more mature phenotype ( 13 , 19 , 20 ) .
Differentiation of U937 cells induced by IFN-y is associated with the binding of two distinct cellular factors to the GAS sequence : IFN-y activation factor ( STAT1 or GAF ) and differentiation-induced factor ( DIF ) ( 7 ) .
The 5 ' end of the CAEV 70-bp IRE contains sequence similarity to the GAS consensus element .
We characterized the binding of cellular factors to and the function of this putative GAS element .
Here we demonstrate that a GAS consensus site in the 70-bp IRE is necessary for regulation of the CAEV LTR by IFN-y and is sufficient to confer IFN-y responsiveness .
We further identify the cellular factor binding to this sequence as STAT1 .
To our knowledge , these findings are the first demonstration of regulation of a viral promoter by a STAT family member .
The LTRs of two different isolates of CAEV , p1244 and Co , contain one or two copies of the 70-bp IRE , respectively ( Fig .
1 ) .
Examination of these LTRs for sequence similarities to binding sites for known transcription factors revealed that the 772 NOTES GAS ah ote e oe ce ne we te tte e ¥us3 J. ViRoL .

Sequences of the CAEV LTR .
The published sequences of two different CAEV strains , Co and p1244 , are shown ( 14 , 23 ) .
Nucleotide positions are numbered relative to the start sites of transcription initiation , which are indicated with bent arrows .
Vertical arrows show the boundaries of the U3 , R , and US regions .
Putative binding sites for AP-1 , AP-4 , and GAS are shown .
The TATA box is underlined .
Dashes in strain p1244 indicate the absence of a 70-bp sequence motif that is duplicated in strain Co .
The 5° and 3 ' regions of the CAEV 70-bp IRE are in boldface .
70-bp IRE contains an imperfect palindrome at the 5 ' end with sequence similarity to the canonical GAS consensus element that has been described in the promoters of several cellular genes regulated by IFN-y ( 5 ) .
To identify the cellular factors interacting with the 70-bp IRE in the CAEV LTR , we synthesized double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5 ' ( positions -175 to -146 ) and the 3 ' ( positions -137 to -108 ) regions of the CAEV 70-bp IRE ( Fig .
1 and 2A ) .
The 5 region contains sequence similarity to the GAS consensus element , while the 3 '' region is divergent .
We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) with nuclear extracts from the promonocytic cell line U937 , which undergoes partial differentiation when treated with IFN-y .
As shown in Fig .
2B , nuclear factors induced by IFN-y bound to the radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the 5 ' region of the CAEV 70-bp IRE ( lane 2 ) .
These factors were not present in unstimulated U937 cells ( Fig .
2B , lane 1 ) .
Factors induced by IFN-y also bound to the palindromic IRE ( pIRE ) ( Fig .
2A ) from the human intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) promoter ( 2 ) used as a positive control ( Fig .
2B , lane 3 ) .
The protein complexes ( Fig .
2B , lanes 2 and 3 ) appeared to have different mobilities .
This difference in mobility might be due to the binding of different but antigenically related factors to these consensus sequences .
Alternatively , the different mobilities might be due to the different lengths of the oligonucleotide probes used for the EMSAs ( 23 and 34 nucleotides , respec-tively ; see Fig .
2A ) , since the unbound radiolabeled ICAM-1 pIRE and the CAEV 5 ' IRE migrated with different mobilities in nondenaturing gels ( data not shown ) .
To demonstrate the role of the putative GAS element in binding of this factor , we disrupted the imperfect palindrome in the 5 ' 70-bp IRE by mutating 2 bp ( Fig .
2A , m5 ' 70-bp IRE ) .
These substitution mutations eliminated the binding of factors induced by IFN-y to the 5 ' 70-bp IRE ( Fig .
2B , lane 4 ) .
The nuclear factors induced by IFN-y did not react with the 3 ' 70-bp IRE ( Fig .
2B , lane 5 ) , which does not have homology to the GAS consensus element .
An additional complex , observed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides , was present in both stimulated and unstimulated cell lysates .
The addition of nonspecific competitor DNA decreased the amount of this complex significantly ( data not shown ) , and thus , we conclude that this additional complex most likely represented nonspecific DNA-protein interactions .
Consequently , a nuclear factor ( s ) induced by IFN-y bound to the GAS element in the 5 ' 70-bp IRE from the CAEV LTR and to the ICAM-1 pIRE .
These factors reacted with neither the mutated GAS oligonucleotide nor the divergent 3 ' 70-bp IRE .
The specificity of the complexes induced by IFN-y was demonstrated in competition experiments .
Unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the 5° 70-bp IRE , the m5 ' 70-bp IRE , the ICAM pIRE , or the 3 ' 70-bp IRE were added in 30-fold excess Vou .

( B ) IFN-y induces a nuclear factor in promonocytic cells that binds to the CAEV GAS .
U937 cells were treated with medium alone ( lane 1 ) or with IFN-y ( 200 U/ml ) ( lanes 2 to 5 ) for 30 min .
Nuclear extracts from these cells were incubated with radiolabeled duplex oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5 ' ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and 3 ' ( lane 5 ) regions of the CAEV 70-bp IRE ( 5 ' 70-bp IRE and 3 ' 70 bp IRE , respectively ) and a mutant 5 ' 70-bp oligonucleotide containing two mutations in the CAEV GAS element ( m5 ' 70 bp IRE , in lane 4 ) .
As a positive control , a pIRE of the ICAM-1 promoter ( ICAM pIRE , lane 3 ) was used .
The complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5 % native polyacrylamide gel as previously described ( 2 , 7 ) .
( C ) Specificity of binding demonstrated by competition analyses using unlabeled duplex oligonucleotides .
The 5 ' 70-bp IRE was radiolabeled and incubated with nuclear extracts from unstimulated U937 cells ( lane 1 ) and from U937 cells stimulated with IFN-y ( lane 2 to 6 ) .
Unlabeled oligonucleotides representing the 5 ' 70-bp IRE ( lane 3 ) , the m5 ' 70-bp IRE ( lane 4 ) , the ICAM pIRE ( lane 5 ) , and the 3 ' 70-bp IRE ( lane 6 ) were added in 30-fold molar excess prior to the binding reaction .
Complexes were resolved as described above .
( D ) The similarity of the complexes that bind to the ICAM-1 pIRE and the CAEV 5 ' 70-bp IRE was demonstrated by competition analyses .
The ICAM-1 pIRE was radiolabeled and incubated with nuclear extracts from unstimulated U937 cells ( lanes 1 and 3 ) and from the cells stimulated with IFN-y ( lanes 2 and 4 ) .
The unlabeled 5 ' 70-bp IRE ( lane 3 ) was added in 30-fold molar excess prior to the binding reaction , and complexes were resolved as described above .
as specific competitors for binding of nuclear factors to the radiolabeled 5 ' 70-bp IRE ( Fig .
2C ) .
An excess of the unlabeled 5 ' 70-bp IRE , as well as the ICAM-1 pIRE inhibited formation of the complexes induced by IFN-y ( Fig .
2C , lanes 3 and 5 , respectively ) in a specific manner .
Consistent with our hypothesis , competition with an excess of the m5 ' 70-bp IRE and the 3 ' 70-bp IRE ( Fig .
2C , lanes 4 and 6 ) did not inhibit the binding .
To find out if there are similarities between complexes that bind to the ICAM-1 pIRE and the CAEV GAS , we additionally performed competition experiments with the unlabeled CAEV 5 ' IRE and the radiolabeled ICAM-1 pIRE .
The promonocytic cells were incubated with medium alone ( Fig .
2D , lanes 1 and 3 ) or induced with IFN-y ( Fig .
2D , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
The nuclear extracts of these cells were incubated with the radiolabeled ICAM-1 IRE alone ( Fig .
2D , lanes 1 and 2 ) or with the unlabeled CAEV 5 ' IRE ( Fig .
2D , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
The results demonstrate that the unlabeled CAEV 5 '' IRE also competes with nuclear factor binding to the ICAM-1 pIRE ( Fig .
2D , lane 4 ) .
Thus , in promonocytic cells , IFN-y induces a nuclear factor that binds in a specific manner to the GAS element in the CAEV LTR and this factor is similar to the factor that binds to the cellular ICAM-1 pIRE .
The 70-bp IRE from the CAEV LTR can confer responsiveness to IFN-y on a heterologous promoter , the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase ( i ) promoter , as demonstrated by transient transfections of U937 cells ( 26 ) .
To determine whether the 5 ' and/or 3 ' region of the 70-bp IRE motif could confer responsiveness to the ik promoter , we constructed plasmids containing the 5° 70-bp IRE [ pCAEV ( -175/-146 ) tkCAT ] , the m5 ' 70-bp IRE [ pCAEVm ( -175/-146 ) tkCAT ] , and the 3 '' 70-bp IRE [ pCAEV ( -137/-108 ) tkCAT ] , cloned upstream from the ik promoter and the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl- 774 NOTES J.

The GAS sequence in the CAEV LTR is required for IFN response .
A schematic diagram of the CAEV LTR is shown at the top .

U937 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method with plasmids containing the indicated regions of the CAEV LTR upstream from the herpes simplex virus # minimal promoter ( A ) or from the CAT reporter gene ( B ) .
Transfected cells were stimulated with medium alone ( basal ) or with IFN-y ( 200 U/ml ! )

Time course of activation of the nuclear factor that binds to the CAEV GAS .
U937 cells were treated with medium alone ( lane 1 ) or with IFN-y ( lanes 2 to 7 ) for the indicated periods of time .
The cells were treated with cycloheximide ( CXM ) at 10 pg/ml alone ( lane 8 ) or prior to IFN-y treatment ( lane 9 ) .
Nuclear extracts were incubated with the radiolabeled 5 ' 70-bp IRE of CAEV ( wild-type GAS ) and analyzed by EMSA .
transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene ( Fig .
3A and B ) .
These plasmids were transiently transfected into U937 cells by the DEAE-dextran method ( 21 ) and stimulated after 24 h in culture with IFN-y ( final concentration , 200 U/ml ) as described previously ( 26 ) .
The full-length 70-bp IRE and the 5 ' 70-bp IRE resulted in increased basal activity and in similar responses to IFN-y , i.e. , 5.3- and 7.8-fold activation , respectively ( Fig .
3A ) .
Since comparable levels of activation were observed with the ICAM-1 pIRE ( 2 ) , the 70-bp IRE , and the 5 ' 70-bp IRE were considered sufficient to confer responsiveness to IFN-y .
In contrast , the basal activities and the responses of the m5 ' 70-bp IRE , containing the mutated GAS element , and of the 3 ' 70-bp IRE were comparable to that of the unresponsive k promoter alone ( Fig .
3A ) .
Thus , the lack of responsiveness of the m5 ' 70-bp IRE demonstrates the requirement for the GAS sequences for functional activity .
To demonstrate that the GAS element is necessary for the response of the CAEV LTR to IFN-y , we used a functional CAEV LTR containing one copy of the 70-bp IRE in the plasmid pCAEV ( -189/+164 ) CAT .
This plasmid responds to IFN-y with the same efficiency as the wild-type LTR of strain Co ( 26 ) , positions -287 to +164 ( Fig .
1 ) .
The 2-bp substitution mutations described above ( Fig .
2A ) in the GAS element were introduced into pCAEV ( -189/+164 ) CAT by using in vitro mutagenesis ( Altered Sites ; Promega ) .
Transient transfections of the functional LTR , pCAEV ( -189/+164 ) CAT , into U937 cells resulted in 11.6-fold activation in the presence of IFN-y ( Fig .
3B ) .
The mutated GAS element pCAEVm ( -189/ +164 ) CAT partially decreased the basal activity of the CAEV promoter and eliminated the response to IFN-y ( Fig .
3B ) .

Inhibition of binding of a nuclear factor to the CAEV GAS by an anti-STAT1 antibody ( Santa Cruz Biochemicals ) .
Nuclear extracts from U937 cells treated with medium alone ( lane 1 ) or with IFN-y ( lanes 2 to 4 ) were incubated with the radiolabeled CAEV 5 ' 70-bp IRE .
The reaction mixtures were incubated with the anti-STAT1 antibody ( lane 3 ) or with an unrelated control antibody ( lane 4 ) for 20 min at 4°C prior to the addition of the radiolabeled duplex oligonucleotide .
a negative control , deletion of the 70-bp IRE in the construct pCAEV ( -107/+164 ) CAT also resulted in the loss of IFN-y responsiveness .
Thus , the GAS sequence in the CAEV LTR required for the binding of cellular factors induced by IFN-y is also essential for its function as an IRE in the context of the CAEV LTR .
To determine the time course of the inducible factor , EMSAs were performed with nuclear extracts from U937 cells treated with IFN-y for different periods of time .
The nuclear factor that bound to the CAEV GAS element appeared at 5 min ( Fig .
4 , lane 2 ) , was still present at 11 h ( Fig .
4 , lane 6 ) , and disappeared at 14 h postinduction ( Fig .
4 , lane 7 ) .
Formation of the activation complex did not require de novo protein synthesis , as shown by cycloheximide treatment prior to IFN-y induction ( Fig .
4 , lanes 8 and 9 ) .

Preincubation of U937 nuclear extracts with an anti-STAT1 polyclonal antibody ( Santa Cruz Biochemicals , Santa Cruz , Calif. ) inhibited binding of nuclear factors to the CAEV element ( Fig .
5 , lane 3 ) .
Preincubation with a nonspecific control antibody had no effect ( Fig .
5 , lane 5 ) , demonstrating that the inhibition was STAT1 specific .
The STAT1 antibody also inhibited complex formation between the factor induced by IFN-y and the radiolabeled ICAM-1 pIRE but had no effect on the binding of an unrelated protein complex to the radiolabeled AP1 oligonucleotide ( data not shown ) .
Our experiments show that ( i ) the GAS element in the CAEV LTR is essential for the IFN-y response and ( ii ) the nuclear factor that interacts with CAEV GAS is STAT1 or a STATi-like factor .
STAT1 belongs to the STAT family of proteins , which are activated in response to a large number of cytokines , growth factors , and interferons ( 16 ) .
Treatment of monocytes with IFN-y induces the aggregation of the receptor complex .
The recruitment of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2 results in the reversible phosphorylation of the IFN-y receptor « chain , which creates a docking site for the sre homology 2 domain of cytoplasmic latent STAT1 ( 8 ) .
STAT1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated , dissociates from the receptor , dimer-izes , and translocates to the nucleus .
In the nucleus , phosphor-ylated STAT1 binds to the GAS consensus element in the promoters of IFN-inducible genes and initiates transcription .
The strict requirement of STAT1 for IFN-y responsiveness has been recently demonstrated in STAT1-deficient mice ( 6 , 18 ) .
The CAEV GAS consensus element resembles the well-con-served GAS sequence of cellular genes ( Table 1 ) .
Our experiments show that in addition to these cellular genes , IFN-y can activate the transcription of viral genes through the GAS element .
The anti-STAT1 serum used in our experiments ( Fig .
5 ) is STAT1 specific and was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 688 to 700 in the carboxy domain .
It has been used to discriminate between different members of the STAT family , such as STAT3 , STAT4 , and STATS ( 27 ) .
The sequence of the carboxy terminus of STAT1 is unique and is not related to those of the other STAT 's ( 7 ) .
This serum recognizes two naturally occurring splice variants , STAT1 « and STAT1IB ( p91 and p84 , respectively ) .
STAT1a « contains 38 additional C-terminal amino acids .
Although STAT1B becomes phos-phorylated and can bind to DNA , it does not activate transcription after induction with IFN-y ( 5 , 16 ) .
The time course of the appearance of the CAEV GAS binding factor ( Fig .
4 ) is consistent with that of STAT1 ( 5 ) .
Based on our results demonstrating the requirement of CAEV GAS for transcriptional activation ( Fig .
3A and B ) , we conclude that the CAEV GAS binding protein is STAT1a « and that STAT1 is at least one pathway by which the CAEV LTR is activated by IFN-y .
Another factor that can bind to the GAS consensus element is the differentiation-induced factor DIF ( 7 ) .
DIF and STAT1 are clearly distinct molecules , although both are induced in U937 monocytes in response to IFN-y treatment .
DIF has a slower mobility on EMSA than STAT1 , binds to selected GAS elements , and requires de novo protein synthesis ( 7 ) .
Antibodies to p91 ( STAT1 ) abolish the binding of STAT1 to GAS but do not affect the binding of DIF to GAS elements ( 7 ) .
The factor that bound to the CAEV GAS sequence in our experiments was STAT1 and not DIF , since antibodies to STAT1 abolish binding to the CAEV GAS element , and the factor does not require de novo protein synthesis ( Fig .
4 ) .
J. ViRoL .
Our demonstration of STAT1 involvement in upregulation of the CAEV LTR provides an interesting insight into the multiple roles of IFN-y , initially identified due to its antiviral effects .
The role of IFN-y as an antiviral agent is documented by three types of clinical observations : ( i ) IFN production correlates with natural recovery in many viral infections , ( ii ) inhibition of IFN production or action enhances the severity of infection , and ( iii ) IFN treatment protects against viral infection ( 1 ) .
One mechanism for the antiviral effect of IFN-y is a specific inhibitory effect on viral promoters such as the murine cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) immediate-early promoter ( 12 ) .
Inhibition of the murine CMV promoter correlates with inhibition of viral replication by IFN-y in infected fibroblasts .
Alternatively , IFN-y can enhance replication of rat CMV in macrophages ( 10 ) .
In addition , the IFN-y pathway appears to be required for the development and progression of murine AIDS ( 28 ) .
Thus , effects of IFN-y on viral replication in vivo are variable .
CAEV infection of immature monocytes results in low levels of viral replication .
We propose a model in which subsequent infection of the host with other viruses stimulates the production of IFN-y by natural killer cells and the Th1 subset of T-helper cells .
Stimulation of infected monocytes by IFN-y activates not only cellular genes but also the CAEV promoter through the STAT1 pathway .
Activation of the CAEV promoter results in increased viral replication , which could stimulate additional host immune responses .
The host immune and inflammatory responses produce the clinical disease that occurs in CAEV-infected goats .
Whether the STAT1 pathway is essential for the viral life cycle and disease development in the infected host will be addressed in future experiments .
