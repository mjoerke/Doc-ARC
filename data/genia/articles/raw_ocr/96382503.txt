Cross talk between cell death and cell cycle progression : BCL-2 regulates NFAT-mediated activation GERALD P. LInNETTE* , YinG L* , KEvIN ROTH , AND STANLEY J. KorsmEyERT Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Division of Molecular Oncology , Departments of Medicine and Pathology , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , MO 63110 Contributed by Stanley J. Korsmeyer , July 17 , 1996 ABSTRACT BCL-2-deficient T cells demonstrate accelerated cell cycle progression and increased apoptosis following activation .
Increasing the levels of BCL-2 retarded the G , - > S transition , sustained the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27* '' '' '' , and repressed postactivation death .
Proximal signal transduction events and immediate early gene transcription were unaffected .
However , the transcription and synthesis of interleukin 2 and other delayed early cytokines were markedly attenuated by BCL-2 .
In contrast , a cysteine protease inhibitor that also blocks apoptosis had no substantial affect upon cytokine production .
Interleukin 2 expression requires several transcription factors of which nuclear translocation of NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) and NFAT-mediated transactivation were impaired by BCL-2 .
Thus , select genetic aberrations in the apoptotic pathway reveal a cell autonomous coregulation of activation .
Homeostasis of cell numbers requires a carefully orchestrated balance between input ( proliferation ) and output ( cell death ) processes .
Important questions remain as to how these two reactions are coordinated to achieve a remarkably invariant number of cells within each lineage .
One thesis would hold that two independent genetic pathways exist that control cellular proliferation or cell death .
In this scenario , balance would be attained by communication with extracellular cues .
This includes the well-documented competition between cells for limited survival factors in their surrounding microenvironment ( 1 ) .
Incontrovertible evidence now exists for a distinct genetic pathway controlling programmed cell death .
The Be/-2 protooncogene isolated from the chromosomal breakpoint of t ( 14 ; 18 ) bearing B cell lymphoma ( 2-4 ) serves as a repressor of apoptosis in mammalian cells ( 5-7 ) .
Gain of function studies that overexpressed wild-type Bc/-2 extended survival rather than promoting proliferation and lead to an excess of lymphocytes that eventually progressed to B and T cell malignancy ( 8-10 ) .
Loss of function analysis that knocked out the Bel-2 or Bcl-x , death repressor resulted in the loss of cells from selected lineages ( 11-13 ) .
While hematopoietic lineages appear to develop normally in the Bc/-2-deficient mice , they display a striking inability to maintain homeostasis of lymphocytes with apoptotic loss of B and T cells .
While established gene products clearly regulate apoptosis , it is unclear whether they have roles that affect other pathways .
A second thesis would argue that a balanced population of cells would be difficult to maintain unless a cell autonomous coordination existed between decisions to divide and decisions to die .
A number of experimental models argue that improper activation and aberrant cell cycle progression can prompt individual cells to initiate suicide .
For example , overexpression of Myc in the absence of serum results in apoptosis ( 14 ) .
This has been envisioned as signaling a conflict or perhaps the dual capacity of Myc as a transcription factor to initiate a death as 9545 well as a proliferation program ( 15 ) .
Mice deficient in a cell cycle regulator , the retinoblastoma gene product ( Rb ) , demonstrate abnormal mitotic figures as well as death of embryonic neurons ( 16 , 17 ) .
In parallel , the overexpression of E2F , which mimics Rb deficiency , can also result in apoptosis ( 18 , 19 ) .
From this perspective , there would appear to be a capacity to identify aberrations in proliferation that would trigger the apoptotic elimination of dangerous cells .
We chose to approach this complex issue from the opposite perspective , asking whether regulators of cell death impact the cellular proliferation pathway .
To pursue this , we elected to contrast genetic models of Be/-2 loss-of-function ( If ) and Bcl-2 transgenic gain-of-function ( gf ) using cells from these mice that were otherwise normal .
Be/-2 homozygous knockout ( -/- ) , heterozygous ( +/- ) , wild-type ( +/+ ) , and IckP '' -Bel-2 transgen-ics ( which overexpress wild-type protein , also referred to as Bcl-2 gf ) provide a gradient of BCL-2 levels within T cells ( 10 , 11 ) .
Thus , any effects upon activation and proliferation noted in Bel-2 gf cells would be considerably strengthened by an opposite effect in Bel-2 If cells .
We selected T cells as a representative model of resting , Go , mature cells with distinct stages of transition between Go - > S phase .
T cells require BCL-2 to maintain homeostasis , and a well-defined signal transduction pathway interconnects the T cell surface antigen receptor to cell cycle regulators ( 20 ) .
Steps can be separated into mitogenesis in which proximal signal transduction events lead to immediate early gene expression during the transition from Go - > G1 and into a later critical event in mid G ; phase in which the expression and signaling by interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , a physiologic growth factor , are required for progression into S phase ( 21 ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Preparations and Culture .
Single cell suspensions were prepared from spleen or thymus and erythrocytes were lysed in 0.17 M NHC for 10 min at 4°C .
Splenic T cells were purified by negative selection with immunomagnetic beads as described except that incubation of cells with magnetic beads was performed for 1 hr at 4°C ( 22 ) .

Briefly , protein-A purified anti-mouse CD3 mAb ( 145-2C11 , PharMingen ) was diluted in 0.05 M Tris ( pH 9.3 ) in a volume of 250 pl and allowed to absorb overnight at 4°C .
Afterwards , wells were washed twice and 3-5 x 10° T cells in a volume of 1 mil complete medium were added to individual wells .
When indicated , anti-murine CD28 mAb ( 23 ) ( PV-1 , a gift from C. June , Naval Medical Research Institute ) ( 24 ) was added in fluid phase at a final concentration of 5 ug/ml .
Jurkat T cell line ( 25 ) ( E6-1 clone , American Type Culture Collection ) was transfected with SFFV-human Bc/-2 or control plasmid SFFV-neo .
Stably transfected Jurkat cells were selected in G418 and characterized and monitored for expression of human BCL-2 protein by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and Western blot analysis with the 6C8 mAb ( 7 ) .
Jurkat cells were stimulated with solid phase anti-human CD3 mAb ( HIT3a , PharMingen ) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) 10 ng/ml ( Sigma ) in RPMI 1640 complete media containing 10 % FCS .
Cell Cycle Analysis .
Stimulated T cells were harvested , washed twice in cold PBS , and lysed in Krishan 's reagent ( 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide/0.1 % sodium citrate/0.02 mg/ml ribonuclease A/0.3 % Nonidet P-40 ) .
Cell nuclei were then analyzed at low flow rate for DNA content based on FL-2A versus FL-2W linear plots on a FACscan ( Becton Dickinson ) using CELLFIT or CELLQUEST software .
In several experiments , cell cycle analysis of S-phase distribution was confirmed with BrdU incorporation ( 26 ) .
Reverse Trascription-PCR ( RT-PCR ) .
Total RNA was isolated from activated T cells using the acid quanidium thiocyanate phenol-chloroform extraction method ( RNAzol ) .
One micro-gram RNA was reverse transcribed ( RT Superscript , GIBCO ) with random hexamers to generate cDNA ( 20 wl ) for each time point .
Two microliters of each cDNA mixture was amplified with 0.5 units Taq polymerase ( Perkin-Elmer ) using specific oligonucleotide primers ( 27 ) .
Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the optimal number of cycles for quantitative determination of each reaction product under the conditions of annealing at 60°C ( 1 min ) , extension at 72°C ( 1 min ) , and denaturing at 94°C ( 1 min ) using a Perkin-Elmer Thermocycler .
One tenth of each reaction mixture was electrophoresed on 4-20 % polyacrylamide gels ( NOVEX , San Diego ) in 1 % TBE at 100 volts ; RT-PCR products were transferred to 0.45 u nylon membrane in 0.5 % TBE at 200 mA for 1 hr .
Nylon membranes were probed with *P-end-labeled internal oligonucleotides at 42°C for 16-24 hr .
Membranes were washed and exposed in the linear range of x-ray film ( Kodak ) .
Electrophoretic Mobility-Shift Assay .
Nuclear extracts from 5 X 10 '' Jurkat cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb solid phase and 20 ng/ml PMA in T75 culture flasks were prepared as described ( 28 ) .
Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay .
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay was performed as described ( 29 ) .
Binding reactions were done with 2.5 ug protein in the 10 mM TrisHCI ( pH 7.5 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 0.5 mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol , 10 ug BSA , and 1 ug poly ( dI-dC ) in a volume of 20 pl .
The binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min ( AP-1 ) or 30 min [ NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) , NFKB , OCT with 0.2-0.4 ng double-stranded oligonucleotide .
Gel-purified double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [ y- > '' P ] ATP ( Amersham ) using T4 kinase .
Oligonucleotides for human NFAT , NFxB , AP-1 , and OCT-1 ( 28 , 29 ) containing monomer binding sites were used .
The samples were electrophoresed in native 6 % polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 % TBE at 100 V. Confocal Microscopy .
Both Jurkat/neo and Jurkat/Bcl-2 cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4 % paraformaldehyde and methanol .
Anti-NFATc3 polyclonal antibody and fluores-cein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were used to stain NFATc3 .
Nuclei were counterstained by propidium iodide .
Confocal laser scanning was performed using a Sarastro 2000 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Molecular Dynamics ) and IMMAGE SPACE software ( Molecular Dynamics ) .

USA 93 ( 1996 ) Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay .
Jurkat cells ( 10 ) were transiently transfected by electroporation ( 960 uF , 250 V ) with 10 ug of NFAT-luciferase or AP-1-luciferase reporter DNA .
Eighteen hours after transfection , cells were activated with 300 ng/ml anti-CD3 plus 10 ng/ml PMA .
A number of cells ( 10° ) per each condition were harvested at 6 br after activation for AP-1 or 24 hr for NFAT reporter constructs , and assayed for luciferase activity ( Luciferase Assay System , Promega ) .
RESULTS BCL-2 Influences Thymocyte Cell Cycle .
To assess the effect of BCL-2 on cell cycle progression , thymocytes from Bel-2~~ , Bel-2*'~- , Bel-2*'* , and Ick® '' -Bcel-2 transgenic mice ( gf ) were pulsed with 10 uM BrdU for 1 hr at 37° in 10 % FCS stained with anti-BrdU-fluorescein isothiocyanate and counterstained with propidium iodide .
Similar to prior studies , 8.1 % of Bcel-2*'* ( wild-type ) thymocytes were in S phase ( Fig .
14 ) .
However , more thymocytes were consistently in cycle as BCL-2 levels fell in Bel-2*'~ and Bel-2~~- mice 9.1 % and 9.5 % , respectively , in the examples shown here .
Most strikingly , overexpressed BCL-2 resulted in a marked decrease of thymocytes in S phase , only 1.5 % in the Bc/-2 gf mouse ( Fig .
14 ) .
BCL-2 Levels Determine Cell Volume of Resting T Cells .
Peripheral T cells are in the Go phase of the cell cycle before activation .
Cell volume represents one further measurement of the relative state of quiescence .
The Bel-2~~- , Bel-2*'~ , Bel-2+** , and Bcl-2 gf genotypes displayed stepwise increments of BCL-2 protein in purified splenic T cells ( 10 ) .
We noted that BCL-2 levels dictated T cell size as measured by forward scatter ( linear scale ) on flow cytometry ( Fig .
1B ) .
In the experiment shown , the forward scatter of Bel-2~~ cells was 456 mean channel unites , while the forward scatter of Bel-2*/* T cells was 421 .
In contrast , T cells from Ick®P '' -Bei-2 transgenic mice were the smallest with a forward scatter of 336 .
Similar results were obtained when cell volume was determined by a Coulter Counter ( data not shown ) .
BCL-2 Determines the Duration of G , - > S Phase .
T cells from the Bel-2 genetic models were used to assess the role of BCL-2 upon activation-induced cell cycle progression .
The time course of mitogenesis as measured by the time for stimulated T cells to enter S phase proved proportional to the level of BCL-2 .
Peripheral T cells from individual mice were stimulated with plate bound ( solid phase ) anti-CD3 monoclo-nal antibody ( mAb ) and were analyzed for DNA content by propidium iodide staining at serial time points .
Be/-2 gf T cells showed a marked delay of entry into S phase after activation when compared with Bc/-2*/* T cells .
Conversely , Bel-2~~- T cells entered S phase more rapidly than normal ( Fig .
24 ) .
For example , at 24 hr postactivation , 32 % of Bel-2~~ , 22 % of Bcl-2*~ , 9 % of Bel-2*'* , but only 3 % of Bel-2 gf T cells were in S + G ; /M phase based upon > 2N DNA content .
To determine if Be/-2 could still regulate cells activated through multiple signal transduction pathways , T cells were costimu-lated with anti-CD28 mAb as well as with anti-CD3 .
As previously noted , addition of anti-CD28 mAb to T cells stimulated with optimal concentrations of anti-CD3 has a small , additional affect on cell cycle progression ( 30 ) ( Fig .
2B ) .
At 24 hr postactivation , 35 % of Bel-2~~ , 27 % of Bel-2* ! ~ , 15 % of Bel-2*'* , and yet only 6 % of Bcl-2 gf T cells were determined to be in S + G ; /M .
Thus , BCL-2 had a similar affect upon the kinetics of Go - > S phase transition following costimulation .
BCL-2 Also Affects Activation Induced Cell Death .
Forty-eight hours after stimulation , the percent of cells in S + G ; /M phases decreased in Bc/-2-deficient T cells , but was still increasing in T cells overexpressing Bel-2 ( Fig .
2 4 and B ) .
This suggested that there may be differences in viability that follow activation .
To evaluate this , T cells that were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb were assessed for apoptotic cells , which reside in the population with < 2N DNA content .

For exam- gf T cells remained in with only 8 % apoptotic and 15 % ple , at 24 hr , 27 % of Bel-2-'~- versus 12 % of Bel-2*'* , but only proliferating cells .
These differential results were confirmed by Proc .

BCL-2 regulates the Go - > S transition .
Purified T cells were activated with anti-CD3 mAb ( 500 ng per well solid phase ) ( 4 ) or in combination with anti-CD28 mAb , PV-1 ( 5 ug/ml fluid phase added at time 0 ) ( B ) .
At serial time points , cells from individual wells were harvested and analyzed for DNA content after gating out apoptotic cells ( < 2N DNA content ) and debris .
A total of 10,000 events were collected and cells with > 2N DNA content were determined to be in S + G ; /M phase .
Results are representative of 10 independent experiments .
( C ) Purified T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb were studied for DNA content by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry .
Only small debris was gated out , such that apoptotic nuclei were also included in this analysis .
The percent apoptotic ( < 2N ) and proliferating cells ( > 2N : $ + G ; /M ) is indicated .
Results are representative of three independent experiments .
TUNEL ( TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling ) ( 31 ) , which proved more sensitive than propidium iodide in detecting apoptotic cells ( not shown ) .
Regulation of p27* '' '' but Not p21 Is Altered by BCL-2 .
The retarded entry of Bcei-2 gf T cells into S phase was accompanied by a delayed pattern of retinoblastoma hyperphosphorylation ( data not shown ) .
A prominence of underphosphorylated Rb was also recently noted in Bel-2 gf thymocytes ( 32 ) .
p27P !
( 33 , 34 ) and p21 ( also known as cip1 , sdi , waf1 , and cap20 ) ( 35 , 36 ) are cyclin-dependent kinase ( cdk ) inhibitors present in T cells .
In resting mature T cells , is present at significant levels .
Upon activation , p27 protein is degraded during early-to-mid G ; phase , presumably mediated by IL-2 signaling ( 37 , 38 ) .
Conversely , resting T cells possess minimal amounts of p21 , but upon activation p21 levels increase in G1 .
Be/-2*/~ T cells show an accelerated disappearance of p27P '' protein after anti-CD3 activation , relative to Bce/-2t/'* T cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
This contrasts with a delayed loss of p27*P '' in Bel-2 gf T cells .

- p27°P '' but not p21 levels are affected by BCL-2 .
Western blot analysis of p27©P '' and p21 in T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb ( 500 ng per well solid phase ) at serial time points .
Protein ( 10 ug ) in each lane was run on SDS/12 % polyacrylamide gels , transferred to nitrocellulose , and blotted either with a polyclonal rabbit anti-p27 Ab ( Santa Cruz 1 ug/tl ) or with a mAb to p21 ( a gift from J .
Wade Harper , Baylor College of Medicine ) .
Blots were developed with Enhanced Chemiluminesence ( Amersham ) .
The p27 '' results have been confirmed in two additional experiments .
relative amounts of in T cells of each Bel-2 genotype correlates well with the duration of the Gy - > S phase transition .
In contrast , BCL-2 had no striking effect upon the regulation of p21 ( Fig .
3 ) .
Proximal Signal Transduction and Immediate Early Gene Responses Appear Unaffected by BCL-2 .
The level of cell surface TCR/CD3 complex did not vary among the T cells of various Bcl-2 genotypes ( data not shown ) .
This indicated that the effect of BCL-2 upon T cell activation would reside between proximal signal transduction events and distal cell cycle machinery .
Dissection of this pathway revealed that the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins was similar in activated T cells of the various Bcl-2 genotypes .
Similarly , the rise in intracellular ionized calcium concentrations following activation of T cells or thymocytes was comparable ( data not shown ) .
The time course of immediate early gene induction in response to TCR/CD3 activation was assessed .
The induction of c-Myc RNA was detectable at 30 min postactivation and remained elevated at 1 , 2 , and 6 hr in T cells of all four Be/-2 genotypes ( Fig .
44 ) .
Other immediate early genes ( c-Fos , c-Jun , NGFI-B ) were also induced to a similar degree in each Bcl-2 genotype .
These data indicate that proximal signal transduction events through immediate early gene transcription were not strongly influenced by BCL-2 .
BCL-2 Regulates IL-2 Production by Activated T Cells .
Most cytokines produced by T cells , including IL-2 , display a temporal time course typical of delayed early response genes .
IL-2 is produced by activated T cells and acts as the primary progression factor in mid G , phase for T cell proliferation .
Be/-2 gf T cells produced substantially less ( ~5-fold ) IL-2 compared with Bci-2** T cells at optimal concentrations of anti-CD3 antibody , ( i.e. , 100 and 1000 ng per well ) ( Fig .
54 ) .
Of interest , Bel-2*'~ and Bcl-2-/- T cells produced greater amounts of IL-2 and even produced IL-2 following suboptimal ( i.e. , 10 ng per well ) concentrations of anti-CD3 mAb ( Fig .
54 ) .
Costimulation of T cells with anti-CD28 mAb as well as anti-CD3 mAb can enhance IL-2 production ( as well as other cytokines ) ( 30 ) .
When T cells from all groups were activated with an optimal concentration ( 1000 ng per well ) of anti-CD3 , the addition of anti-CD28 mAb produced approximately 4- to S5-fold more IL-2 ( Fig .
5B ) .
However , increasing amounts of BCL-2 protein proportionally depressed the IL-2 response to costimulation as well ( Fig .
5B ) .
To determine if the influence of BCL-2 operated at the level of cytokine transcription , RT-PCR analysis of ZL-2 and two other T cell-derived cytokines , IL-3 and GM-CSF , was performed .
The induction of IL-2 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF RNA was quite delayed in Bcl-2 gf T cells when compared with Bcel-2*'* cells ( Fig .
4B ) .
Consistent with the data in Fig .
54 , Bel-2~~ T cells showed accelerated transcription of IL-2 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF ( Fig .

more BCL-2 protein when compared with parental Jurkat cells as determined by flow cytometry ( data not shown ) .
When activated with various concentrations of anti-CD3 plus PMA , Jurkat/Bcl-2 cells produce substantially less IL-2 .
Production of IL-3 and GM-CSF is also markedly reduced in Jurkat /Be/-2 cells ( Fig .

Thus , the Jurkat T cell line recapitulates the effects of BCL-2 seen on normal T cells .
We next wished to assess whether decreased cytokine production was a generalized affect that followed any inhibition of the apoptotic pathway .
The ICE-like cysteine proteases are required for programmed cell death , and small molecules that inhibit these proteases can block apoptosis .
A peptide-based molecule , benzoxy carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone ( zZVAD-fmk ) , is an irreversible inhibitor particularly potent against the CPP32-like subset of cysteine proteases .
Our previous studies indicated that treatment of Jurkat T cells with 50 uM zVAD-fmk will protect them from anti-Fas-induced apoptosis and block the activation of CPP32 ( 39 ) .
In contrast to Bci-2 , inhibition of the apoptotic pathway by this protease inhibitor did not substantially alter IL-2 , IL-3 , or GM-CSF production ( Fig .
6 ) .
BCL-2 Selectively Impairs NFAT Binding and Nuclear Translocation .
NFAT , AP-1 , NFxB , and OCT-1 are all transcription factors required for optimal IL-2 transcription ( 20 ) .
To assess the effect of BCL-2 upon their binding activity , Jurkat cells were activated with anti-CD3 plus PMA and nuclear extracts were prepared and tested by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay .
Interestingly , NFAT binding activity from activated Jurkat/Bel-2 cells was substantially diminished when compared with Jurkat/neo cells ( Fig .
74 ) .
Other inducible factors tested including AP-1 and NFKB did not appear to be substantially affected by BCL-2 .
Likewise , OCT-1 , a constitu-tive octamer binding protein , remained unaffected by the expression of BCL-2 ( Fig .
74 ) .
The localization of NFATc3 ( NFAT , ) ( 40 ) within Jurkat T cells was assessed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope .
An antibody recognizing NFATc3 revealed it was predominantly in the cytosol of either unstimulated Jurkat or unstimulated Jurkat/Bel-2 T cells ( Fig .
7B ) .
Eight hours after activation , the NFATc3 in Jurkat cells was essentially absent from the cytosol and was predominantly present in clustered aggregates within the nucleus .
In contrast , NFAT remained prominent in the cytosol of Jurkat cells and the NFAT present within the nucleus displayed a more finely dispersed pattern ( Fig .
7B ) .
Western blot analysis indicated that the total level of NFATc3 was comparable in unstimulated Jurkat and Jurkat/ Bcl-2 cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , Bcl-2 markedly alters the activation-induced nuclear translocation of NFAT .
BCL-2 Inhibits NFAT-Mediated Transactivation .
We next assessed whether the decreased NFAT translocation and DNA Proc .
Natl .
Acad .
Sci .
USA 93 ( 1996 ) binding activity manifested as impaired NFAT-mediated gene transcription .
Jurkat/neo and Jurkat/Bcl-2 cells were transiently transfected either with the NFAT-luciferase construct or with a control AP-1-luciferase construct ( 29 ) .
Transfected Jurkat cells were subsequently activated with anti-CD3 plus PMA and assayed for luciferase activity .
AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation was comparable in both the activated Jurkat/neo and Jurkat/Bcl-2 cells ( Fig .
8 ) .
In contrast , the presence of BCL-2 resulted in up to a 40-fold suppression of NFAT-mediated transactivation ( Fig .
8 ) .
DISCUSSION Bci-2 genetic models of altered cell death provide evidence for a cell autonomous coordination between apoptosis and cell cycle progression .
A gradient of BCL-2 levels revealed a linear relationship between the susceptibility to activation and the vulnerability to death .
The level of BCL-2 dictated the duration of Go - > S phase transition with a critical point of regulation at the mid G , phase dependence upon IL-2 synthesis and signaling ( Fig .
9 ) .
Mazel et al .
( 32 ) also recently noted a delay in the S phase transition of Bc/-2 transgenic cells when compared with wild type .
The classical measurements of mitogenesis and of Gy - > G ; transition were not strongly influenced by BCL-2 .
Proximal signal transduction events including tyrosine phosphorylation and mobilization of Ca** were quite similar whatever the BCL-2 level .
Expression of immediate early genes including Myc , Fos , Jun , and NGF-IB is a classic criterion for Go - > G , phase transition , but was not altered by BCL-2 .
The most dramatic effect of BCL-2 upon T cell activation was focused at the production of IL-2 in mid G ; phase .
The transcription of IL-2 was the most definable point of cross talk between BCL-2 and activation ( Fig .
9 ) .
Optimal expression of IL-2 requires three inducible transcription factors , NFAT , AP-1 , and NFKB .
Any of these three might have been responsible as prior studies ( these are provided below as each is detailed ) have implicated each in affecting cell death .
FOS , which forms heterodimers with JUN to constitute AP-1 , is expressed after a variety of death stimuli ( 41 ) .
NFB appears to be regulated by redox and has also been implicated in regulating cell death ( 42 ) .
NFAT is a transcription factor supracomplex composed of distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic subunits that act in concert to permit DNA binding and transcriptional activation ( 40 , 43 , 44 ) .
NFAT-mediated IL-2 transcription is complex .
NFATp/c rapidly translocates to the nucleus after Ca** signaling , an event blocked by cyclosporin A and hence requiring the action of the phosphatase PP2B , calcineurin ( 45 , 46 ) .
The ability of BCL-2 to inhibit NFAT DNA binding and impair NFAT-mediated gene transcription identifies it as a principal site of BCL-2 's influence .

BCL-2 impairs NFAT-mediated transactivation .
Jurkat/ neo and Jurkat clones were transiently transfected either with a NFAT reporter or with an AP-l-luciferase reporter con-struct .
After stimulation with anti-CD3 plus PMA , 10° cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity .
Results are expressed as the mean fold induction from three independent assays measuring luciferase activity in stimulated over unstimulated cells .
BCL-2-expressing cells suggests this step as a major site of BCL-2 regulation .
Inhibition of calcineurin by CsA/cyclophilin or FK506/FKBP indicates that it is critical to regulating IL-2 and other cytokines NFAT has been implicated in TCR/CD3-mediated cell death and CsA can inhibit this apoptotic pathway in T cell hybridomas ( 47 ) .
One possibility is that NFAT induces a death program as well as a proliferation program .
While IL-2 regulation by NFAT is a clearly defined site of BCL-2 impact upon activation , others could exist .
Other cytokine responses , IL-3 and GM-CSF , were also abnormal yet also require NFAT ( 43 ) .
Adding exogenous IL-2 to BCL-2-expressing T cells only corrected about half of the activation deficit .
This may reflect the delay in IL-2Ra , CD25 expression also noted in BCL-2 overexpressing cells ( data not shown ) .
Evidence that a rapamycin-sensitive intracellular IL-2 signaling pathway leads to Bel-2 gene induction has recently been noted ( 48 ) and might represent a feedback control system .
The level of BCL-2 had a selective impact upon the cdk inhibitor p27P '' , but not p21 .
Recent evidence indicates that IL-2 signaling correlates with a transition in cell cycle control from the p27* '' '' to the p21 cdk inhibitor ( 37 , 38 ) .
The cdk inhibitors are felt to interconnect proximal signal transduction events with regulation of the cdks that phosphorylate substrates including retinoblastoma and thus regulate cell cycle ( 49 , 50 ) .
Normally , IL-2 signaling leads to the inactivation of allowing edk activation and subsequent progression through G ; into S phase .
The more rapid loss of p27°P !
in Bel-2 If cells and its retention in Bcl-2 gf cells may follow from the altered IL-2 production .
Bands were judged to be specific ( indicated by arrows ) based on competition analysis with cold oligonucleotides and supershift with antibodies specific for each transcription factor ( data not shown ) .

Schematic representation of a site of BCL-2 's affect upon activation .
However , we can not formally exclude a primary effect of BCL-2 upon a cdk inhibitor such as p27P '' .
The influence of BCL-2 upon Go - S $ transition and upon p27 but not p21 fits well with the emerging data that p27 may regulate cdk activity from quiescence to S phase , while p21 may be more restricted to regulating odk function in cycling cells ( 38 ) .
Prior studies noted little effect of BCL-2 on doubling time as long as factor-dependent cells were continuously proliferating in the presence of IL-3 .
However , when cells were returned to Go by IL-3 deprivation , the time required to return to S phase following readdition of IL-3 was lengthened by BCL-2 ( 51 , 52 ) .
The shortened Go - > S phase transition time in Be/-2 If cells described here argues that the delays noted with Be/-2 gf are a primary event rather than an artifact of damaged cells that avoided death .
Moreover , the inability of a cysteine protease inhibitor to alter cytokine production also favors a selective role for Bc/-2 rather than a secondary effect following inhibition of apoptosis .
What would be the teleologic advantage of communication between cell death and cell cycle pathways ?
Postactivation apoptosis accompanied the accelerated cell cycle progression of Bcil-2-deficient cells .
This is reminiscent of the fulminant lym-phoid apoptosis noted in Be/-2~~ mice ( 11 ) .
However , even healthy appearing Be/-2 knockouts display a progressive decline in peripheral T and B cells over time .
As a correlate , T cell cultures that are not stimulated ( media with 10 % FCS ) also demonstrated increased death of Be/-2~~ cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , BCL-2 loss leads to immunodeficiency both from an apparently shorter half-life of resting cells and from a susceptibility to postactivation-induced death .
In contrast , excess BCL-2 leads to hyperplasia and would be expected to save cells with acquired mutations that would otherwise be destined to die .
In this context , it was surprising that the incidence of malignancies was relatively low ( 12-30 % ) and had a long latency ( 1-1.5 years ) in Bcl-2 transgenic mice ( 8-10 ) .
The growth disadvantage of Bcl-2-overexpressing cells as noted here would help explain this paradox .
Excess BCL-2 would suppress the outgrowth and accumulation of such death resistant cells .
A cell autonomous interrelationship between cell death and cell cycle programs would provide the tightest regulation to ensure both balanced homeostasis and cancer surveillance .
