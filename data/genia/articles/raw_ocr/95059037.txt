We have demonstrated that the monocyte-specific expression of the CSF-1 receptor is regulated at the level of transcription by a tissue-specific promoter whose activity is stimulated by the monocyte/B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 ( D.-E.

Here we report that the tissue specificity of this promoter is also mediated by sequences in a region II ( bp -88 to -59 ) , which lies 10 bp upstream from the PU.1-binding site .
When analyzed by DNase footprinting , region II was protected preferentially in monocytic cells .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that region II interacts specifically with nuclear proteins from monocytic cells .
Two gel shift complexes ( Mono A and Mono B ) were formed with separate sequence elements within this region .
Competition and supershift experiments indicate that Mono B contains a member of the polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2/core-binding factor ( PEBP2/CBF ) family , which includes the AML ] gene product , while Mono A is a distinct complex preferentially expressed in monocytic cells .
Promoter constructs with mutations in these sequence elements were no longer expressed specifically in monocytes .
Furthermore , multimerized region II sequence elements enhanced the activity of a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter in monocytic cells but not other cell types tested .
These results indicate that the monocyte/B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 and the Mono A and Mono B protein complexes act in concert to regulate monocyte-specific transcription of the CSF-1 receptor .
During hematopoiesis , pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow give rise to committed progenitor cells that eventually form lineage-specific mature circulating blood cells , including erythrocytes , T and B lymphocytes , megakaryocytes , granulo-cytes , and monocytes/macrophages ( 12 ) .
Characterization of the transcription factors regulating the lineage commitment of hematopoietic progenitor cells is an important step toward understanding the mechanisms of cellular differentiation and organ development .
For example , the transcription factor GATA-1 has been shown to play important regulatory roles in progenitor cells differentiating in the erythrocyte lineage ( 17 ) , but less is known about the molecular basis of monocytic lineage commitment .
Many experiments have demonstrated that the macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( colony-stimulating factor 1 [ CSF-1 ] ) is required for the differentiation , proliferation , and survival of monocytic phagocytes ( 20 , 22 ) .
The CSF-1 receptor , which is identical to the product of the c-fms proto-oncogene , is a 150-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein with an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain ( 20 ) .
The expression of the CSF-1 receptor is normally restricted to two tissues , monocytes and placental trophoblasts , in which it is regulated by different * Corresponding author .

8085 promoters ( 18 , 24 ) .
In monocytes , transcription starts at multiple sites within 200 bp of the ATG start codon .
In placental trophoblastic cells , transcription starts 26 kb upstream and includes an additional noncoding exon .
CSF-1 receptor mRNA and surface expression of the protein can be detected in the early stages of monocytic differentiation and increases dramatically with increasing cell maturity within this lineage ( 19 , 25 ) .
Because the expression of the CSF-1 receptor is developmentally regulated and restricted to the monocytic cells , it can be used as a model with which to study the mechanisms regulating commitment to the monocytic lineage .
We have previously demonstrated by nuclear run-on analysis that tissue-specific expression of the CSF-1 receptor is regulated at a transcriptional level in monocytic cells ( 30 ) .
In addition , sequences 500 bp upstream of the transcriptional origins in monocytic cells contain tissue-specific promoter activity ( 18 , 30 ) .
The B-cell- and myeloid cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 ( Spil ) binds to sequences within this promoter region and plays an important role in this tissue-specific promoter activity ( 30 ) .
Although important for expression of the CSF-1 receptor gene by monocytes , PU.1 is also found in B lymphocytes ( 6 ) .
Mutation of the PU.1-binding site decreases CSF-1 receptor promoter activity in a tissue-specific fashion , although the mutated promoter still retains residual tissue-specific activity ( 30 ) .
This finding suggests that there are probably other monocyte-specific elements that direct tissue specific expression of the CSF-1 receptor gene in combination with PU.1 .
In 8086 ZHANG ET AL .
the present study , we investigated this possibility by promoter deletion analysis and DNA binding experiments .
We report the discovery of two other transcription complexes that bind just upstream of the PU.1 site and demonstrate the importance of their binding sites for CSF-1 receptor monocyte-specific promoter activity .
One of the complexes is related to the PEBP2/ CBF family member AML1I ( 9 ) , which is located at the breakpoint of a common chromosome translocation in acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) and has recently been reported to play a role in the myeloid cell-specific expression of the myeloperoxidase gene ( 11 ) .
The other complex is expressed preferentially but not exclusively in monocytic cells .
These two complexes bind to a region which comprises a monocyte-specific enhancer element which , along with the adjacent PU.1-binding site , direct monocyte-specific expression of the CSF-1 receptor gene .

These constructs and the promoterless pGL2-basic vector alone were transfected into U937 monocytic leukemia cells and Jurkat T-lymphoid leukemia cells in two independent experiments .
The reporter gene activity of each construct in relative light units ( RLU ) is shown as a bar chart .
To control for differences in transfection efficiency , we cotransfected a plasmid containing a SEAP gene driven by the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat .

Heterologous promoter analysis .
The head-to-tail-ligated tetramer and hexamer of the region II wild-type double-stranded oligonucleotide ( -88 to -59 ) were inserted into the Sall site of pBluescript ( KS- ) , digested with Xhol and HindIII , blunt ended , and religated into Smal-digested pT8l-luc to form p ( Mono ) , T81-luc , p ( Mono ) , T8l-luc , and p ( Monod ) se T81-luc .
p ( Mono ) , T81-lue and p ( Mono ) , T81-luc contain the tetramer and hexamer of region II in the 5 ' site of the thymidine kinase promoter in pT81-luc in the same orientation as in the parental promoter .
p ( Mono ) , g T81-luc contains the hexamer of region II in the reversed orientation .
These constructs were transfected into monocytic and nonmonocytic cell lines to compare the promoter activity relative to that of the basal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter construct pT81-lue ( 10 , 30 ) .
RESULTS Deletion analysis of the CSF-1 receptor promoter demonstrates that as little as 85 bp of 5 ' flanking DNA directs monocytic expression .
Previous studies of the human CSF-1 receptor promoter indicated that the proximal promoter adjacent to exon 2 displayed specificity for cells of the myeloid/ macrophage lineage ( 18 , 30 ) .
To further examine the activity of the proximal promoter and to identify the cis-acting regulatory elements responsible for tissue specificity , we generated a series of deletion mutants and tested them by a transient transfection assay in U937 and Jurkat cells , using luciferase reporter constructs .
The construct containing 480 bp upstream of the 5 ' major transcription initiation site in human monocytic cells ( 18 ) was expressed at approximately 10-fold-higher levels in U937 ( monocytic ) cells than in Jurkat ( T-lymphocytic ) cells ( Fig .
1 ) .
The activity of the promoter in both cell lines increased with deletions extending to -214 bp , suggesting the loss of sequences mediating transcriptional repression .
A construct retaining only 85 bp of the promoter upstream of the initiation site retained most of the promoter activity of the -214 bp construct , as well as the tissue-restricted pattern of expression , with 15-fold-higher levels of activity in U937 cells than in Jurkat cells .
These results suggest that there are both negative and positive cis-acting elements in the 480-bp region immediately upstream of the major CSF-1 receptor initiation site that are responsible for the CSF-1 receptor promoter activity and indicate the presence of important positive elements in a fragment containing only 85 bp of 5° flanking DNA relative to the major start site of transcription .
Nuclear proteins from monocytic cells interact with the CSF-1 receptor promoter in a cell-type-specific manner .
cis-acting elements direct the promoter 's activity through interaction with ubiquitous and tissue specific trans-acting factors .
To further analyze the factors mediating monocyte-specific CSF-1 receptor promoter activity , we performed DNase I footprinting with a DNA fragment containing the CSF-1 receptor promoter and nuclear proteins from Mono Mac 6 and U937 monocytic leukemia cells and HeLa cervical carcinoma epithelial cells .
As shown in Fig .
2 , three regions of the CSF-1 receptor promoter ( bp -150 to +60 ) interacted with nuclear proteins from monocytic cells .
When coding-strand-labeled DNA fragments were used as probes , nuclear proteins from both monocytic and nonmonocytic cells protected region I , including the 8088 ZHANG ET AL .

EMSA of DNA-protein interactions at region II of the CSF-1 receptor promoter with nuclear proteins from different cell lines .
A double-stranded CSF-1 receptor promoter oligonucleotide extending from bp -88 to -59 was end labeled and incubated in the absence of nuclear protein ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of 10 ug of nuclear protein prepared from THP-1 ( monocytic ) cells ( lane 2 ) , Mono Mac 6 ( monocytic ) cells ( lanes 3 and 9 ) , HeLa ( epithelioid ) cells ( lane 4 ) , Jurkat ( T-lymphoid ) cells ( lane 5 ) , BJA-B ( B-lymphoid ) cells { lane 6 ) , U937 ( monocytic ) cells ( lane 7 ) , and REX ( T-lymphoid ) cells ( lane 10 ) .
Lanes 1 to 8 and lanes 9 and 10 are from two independent but similar experiments .

Region II was protected by nuclear proteins from Mono Mac 6 and U937 .
The nuclear extract from HeLa cells did not show any protection of the coding-strand-labeled DNA probe ( Fig .
2A ) .
With the noncoding-strand-labeled DNA probe , nuclear extract from HeLa cells generated a DNase I-hypersensitive band at bp -93 similar to that formed by nuclear extracts from monocytic cell lines U937 and Mono Mac 6 .
In addition , there was a decrease of DNase I sensitivity at bp -69 compared with DNA without any nuclear extract .
Region III is protected by nuclear proteins from each type of cells .
With DNase I footprinting analysis , purified Spl gave a strong protection in region III ( data not shown ) .
Because the protection at region II appeared to be specific for monocytic cells , EMSA was used to further study the tissue distribution of the factor or factor ( s ) that bind to these sequences .
A *°P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide extending from bp -88 to -59 was used as the probe .
As shown in Fig .
3 , two major shifted bands were detected with nuclear proteins from monocytic THP-1 , Mono Mac 6 , and U937 cells but not with nuclear proteins from a number of nonmonocytic cell types , including lymphoid Jurkat ( T ) and BJA-B ( B ) leukemia cells and epithelial HeLa carcinoma cells .
In these latter three nonmonocytic cell types , very faint levels of the faster-migrating complex can be observed upon overexposure of the autoradiogram .
Nuclear protein from the early T-cell line REX contained significant amounts of the faster-migrating shifted band .
We have named the slower-migrating complex Mono A and the faster-migrating complex Mono B .
There were two faster-migrating nonspecific bands that were also evident when a single-stranded oligonucleotide was used as the probe ( Fig .
3 , lane 8 ) .
CSF-1 RECEPTOR MONOCYTIC REGULATORY ELEMENT 8089 Mutations in region II abolish binding of factors Mono A and Mono B to region IL .
To further study the interaction of monocytic nuclear proteins with region II of the CSF-1 receptor promoter , specific mutations were programmed into region II oligonucleotides and tested for the ability to compete for the Mono A- and Mono B-binding activities .
Particularly informative mutant oligonucleotides are shown in Fig .
4A , together with competition analysis of mutant unlabeled oligonucleotides for binding to a wild-type region II oligonucleotide probe ( Fig .
4B ) .
Mutant A oligonucleotide competed for the binding of the Mono B complex but not the Mono A complex .
By contrast , mutant B oligonucleotide competed for the Mono A complex but not for the Mono B complex .
These results suggested that the slower-migrating monocyte-specific complex ( Mono A ) was formed by the interaction of nuclear protein with the 5 end of the region II probe and the more rapidly migrating complex ( Mono B ) with the 3 ' end .
To further characterize the interaction of Mono A and Mono B components with region II of the CSF-1 receptor promoter , double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the 5 ' ( oligonucleotide A , bp -88 to -73 ) and 3 ' ( oligonucleotide B , bp -75 to =59 ) sequences of region II were used in band shift competition analyses ( Fig .
4C ) .
Mono A specifically bound to 5 ' region II oligonucleotide A ( lanes 1 to 4 ) .
This binding was competed for by unlabeled oligonucleotide A ( lane 4 ) but not by unlabeled oligonucleotide B ( lane 3 ) .
Mono B specifically bound to 3 ' region II oligonucleotide B ( lanes 5 to 8 ) .
The DNA sequence TGTGGT in oligonucleotide B matches the consensus sequence for nuclear factor PEBP2/CBF binding ( 5 , 21 , 23 ) .
To determine whether Mono B is related to the PEBP2/CBF family , EMSA was performed with the PEBP2/ CBF-binding site GGATATCTGTGGTAAGCA from the Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer as a competitor ( 27 ) .
As shown in Fig .
5A , the Mono B complex can be competed for efficiently with both oligonucleotide B and the PEBP2/CBF-binding site but not with the CSF-1 receptor PU.1-binding site ( 30 ) .
These data suggest a close relationship between Mono B and PEBP2/CBF .
To further characterize Mono B , antiserum raised against the N-terminal region of one of the PEBP2/CBF family members , AML1 ( 7 ) , was used in the EMSA analysis .
As shown in Fig .
5B , we detected a supershifted band with AML1 antiserum but not with antiserum against nuclear factor Oct-1 .
These data confirmed that Mono B is a member of the PEBP2/CBF family and identical to or closely related to AMLL1 .
Protein-DNA interactions of Mono A and Mone B with region II sites are critical for CSF-1 receptor promoter activity .
To analyze the function of the protein-DNA interactions in region II , specific mutations were generated in this region of the CSF-1 receptor promoter luciferase construct pM-CSF-R-luc with the sequences shown in Fig .
4A , in the context of the -416 to +71 CSF-1 receptor promoter , to generate pM-CSF-R ( MA ) -lue and pM-CSF-R ( MB ) -luc .
pM-CSF-R ( MA ) -luec and pM-CSF-R ( MB ) -luc contain mutations in the binding sites for Mono A and Mono B , respectively ( Fig .
4 ) .
Results of competion experiments with mutant A and mutant B oligonucleotides ( Fig .
4 ) indicated that mutant A no longer bound Mono A but did not affect Mono B binding , and mutant B affected only the binding of Mono B .
To further confirm that these mutations did not generate any new interactions with other nuclear factors , EMSA was performed with either mutant A or mutant B as a probe ( Fig .
6A ) .
Mutant A probe only generated a Mono B complex ( lane 2 ) , which could be abolished either by mutant A or wild-type oligonucleotide ( lane 4 ) .

Mono B is related to PEBP2/CBF .
( A ) A double-stranded CSF-1 receptor promoter oligonucleotide extending from bp -75 to -59 was labeled and incubated without any nuclear protein ( lane 1 ) or with 5 mg of nuclear protein prepared from monocytic Mono Mac 6 cells ( lanes 2 to 7 ) .
The following unlabeled , double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were added : lane 2 , no added competitor ; lane 3 , 10-fold molar excess self ( oligonucleotide B ) competitor ; lane 4 , 50-fold molar excess of self competitor ; lane 5 , consensus PEBP2/CBF site from the Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer ( 5 ' GGATATCTGTGGTAAGCA 3 ' ) ( 27 ) , 10-fold molar excess ; lane 6 , PEBP2/CBF competitor , 50-fold molar excess ; lane 7 , CSF-1 receptor PU.1 site , 50 fold molar excess .
( B ) The CSF-1 receptor oligonucleotide used for panel A was labeled and incubated without any nuclear protein ( lane 1 ) or with 5 mg of nuclear protein prepared from monocytic THP-1 cells ( lanes 2 to 5 ) .
In lane 3 , a 100-fold molar excess of self ( oligonucleotide B ) competitor oligonucleotide was added .
In lane 4 , 1 pl of an anti-AML1 antiserum ( 7 ) was added to the extract prior to the addition of labeled probe .

CSF-1 RECEPTOR MONOCYTIC REGULATORY ELEMENT 8091 complex ( lane 7 ) , which could be abolished by either mutant B ( lane 8 ) or wild-type ( lane 9 ) oligonucleotide .
Transient transfection experiments showed that each mutation decreased CSF-1 receptor promoter activity to 13 % of the wild-type level in monocytic cells ( Fig .
6B ) .
These mutations did not affect promoter activity in nonmonocytic Hela and REX cells , although the reporter luciferase activity was still more than 10 times higher than the promoterless luciferase construct activity ( Fig .
6B ) .
Thus , region II and its binding proteins are essential for tissue-specific CSF-1 receptor promoter activity .
As we reported previously , the myeloid cell- and B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 binds to the CSF-1 receptor promoter at bp -51 to -33 ( region I in Fig .
2 ) ( 30 ) .
The mutation at region I abolishes PU.1 binding and decreases CSF-1 receptor promoter activity in a tissue-specific manner to 16 % of wild-type promoter activity .
To understand the contributions of PU.1 and proteins binding to region II to CSF-1 receptor promoter activity , deletion construct pMCSF-R ( DD ) -luc , containing a bp -86 to -37 deletion , was used in transient transfections .
As shown in Fig .
6 , this deleted CSF-1 receptor promoter construct lost almost all activity in monocytic cells .
In another set of four independent experiments , a deletion from bp -86 to -62 , removing the Mono A- and Mono B-binding sites , reduced promoter activity 16 % *+ 5 % ( standard devia-tion , comparable to that shown in Fig .
6B for either mutant A ( 13 % ) or mutant B ( 13 % ) alone .
In summary , the results shown in Fig .
6 demonstrate that both region II proteins and PU.1 are important for CSF-1 receptor promoter activity .
CSF-1 receptor promoter region II functions as a tissue-specific enhancer .
To further demonstrate the role of region II-specific factors for promoter activity , these sequences were multimerized and inserted upstream of a basal thymidine kinase promoter-luciferase construct , pT8l-luc , to form p ( Mono ) , T81-luc , p ( Mono ) , T81-luc , and p ( Mono ) sg T81 -luc .
These constructs and the parent pT8l-luc construct were transiently transfected into monocytic Mono Mac 6 cells and nonmonocytic REX and HeLa cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
Promoter activity increased 20- to 30-fold when multimerized region II constructs were transfected into Mono Mac 6 cells , while promoter activity in nonmonocytic cells remained at near baseline levels .
In addition , when the orientation of the hexamer was reversed in p ( Mono ) , g TK81-luc , region II had slightly greater ability to act as an activator in monocytic cells , indicating orientation-independent activity mediated through these sequences .
DISCUSSION Previous studies have indicated that the monocyte/macro-phage specificity of the human CSF-1 receptor is mediated by transcriptional mechanisms and that as little as 416 bp of the promoter can direct monocyte-specific expression of reporter genes in transient transfections of human cell lines ( 18 , 30 ) .
In these studies , we identified a functional binding site for the macrophage factor PU.1 , which was shown to play a critical role in macrophage-specific expression of the promoter ( 30 ) .
In this report , we extended these studies to examine what other factors might regulate this promoter .
Deletion studies demonstrated that as little as 85 bp of upstream sequence directed nearly threefold-higher levels of promoter activity with nearly twofold-greater relative specificity as compared with results with a larger 480-bp promoter .
These findings suggest the presence of negative regulatory elements with some degree of cell type specificity and , importantly , that the major positive factors determining macrophage specificity act on a limited 85-bp region .
What transcription factors interact with this 85 bp region ?

Nuclear factor Mono A and Mono B are critical for CSF-1 receptor promoter activity .
( A ) To demonstrate which complexes bind to the mutant oligonucleotides used in the functional studies in panel B , double-stranded CSF-1 receptor promoter mutant A ( lanes 1 to 5 ) and mutant B ( lanes 6 to 10 ) oligonucleotides were labeled and incubated without any nuclear protein ( lanes 1 and 6 ) or with 5 ug of nuclear protein prepared from monocytic THP-1 cells ( lanes 2 to 5 and 7 to 10 ) .
The following unlabeled , double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were added at a 100-fold molar excess over probe oligonucleotide : lanes 3 and 10 , mutant A ; lanes 4 and 9 , wild-type bp -88 to -59 oligonucleotide ; lanes 5 and 8 , mutant B oligonucleotide .
Sequences of the wild-type , mutant A , and mutant B oligonucleotides are shown in Fig .

Further analysis demonstrated at least two distinct complexes in EMSA with probes corresponding to sequences from this region .
Functional studies show that both play a significant role in macrophage expression of the promoter .
The sequences at the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of region II , containing the binding sites for Mono A and Mono B , respectively , are not similar , suggesting that these two complexes contain different DNA-binding activities and are not simply different isoforms of a single DNA-binding activity .
The results of competition studies ( Fig .
5A ) and supershift experiments ( Fig .
5B ) indicate that Mono B contains a member of the PEBP2/CBF family of transcription factors .
These factors consist of heterdimers between DNA-binding a sub-units , which recognize the consensus site TGTGGT , and a B subunit which does not bind DNA directly but enhances the binding of the a subunit ( 26 , 27 ) .
Multiple « subunit genes and alternatively spliced isoforms of the a and B subunits have been detected .
The a subunits include a Drosophila runt homology domain which mediates DNA binding and protein-protein interactions .
One of the human a genes ( AML1 ) is located at the breakpoint of the relatively common translocation t ( 8 ; 21 ) ( q22 ; q22 ) found in one of the most common forms of FAB M2 AML .
The B chain is also involved in a chromosome translocation [ inv ( 16 ) ( p13q22 ) ] associated with FAB M4eo AML .
Therefore , each of the two chains of the PEBP2/ CBF heterodimer is directly implicated the pathogenesis of VoL .

AML .
As has been recently pointed out ( 11 ) , the fusion proteins produced in these translocations could block normal myeloid differentiation by altering normal PEBP2/CBF func-tion , which serves to activate the expression of at least two important myeloid target genes , those encoding myeloperoxidase and the CSF-1 receptor .
In our supershift studies ( Fig .
5B ) , an antiserum raised against the 17-amino-acid N terminus of AML1 shifted only a fraction of the Mono B complex .
The same results were obtained by other investigators ( 7 , 11 ) .
This serum is likely to react with the related PEBP2 « A protein and perhaps other family members as well .
The unshifted Mono B complex could consist of a PEBP2/CBF « chain with an amino terminus not recognized by this antiserum , either because of sequence divergence or because the epitope is in a conformation not recognized by the antiserum .
Alternatively , it is still possible that part of the unshifted Mono B complex is formed by an unrelated protein .
The identity of the Mono A factor remains to be determined .
Mono A can bind independently in the absence of the Mono B site , but our competition studies ( Fig .
6A ) show that the mutant A oligonucleotide ( containing an intact Mono B site ) variably and partially competes for Mono A binding , suggesting cooperativity in binding or some type of similarity between proteins of the Mono A and Mono B complexes .
PEBP2/CBF has been described to interact with either the Ets-1 ( 28 ) or Myb ( 4 ) transcription factor , and the adjacent Mono A site includes a GGAA core characteristic of Ets family-binding sites .
Whether Mono A represents a member of the Ets family ( which includes the PU.1 factor binding downstream of region II ) remains to be determined .
We found no direct evidence for interaction between PU.1 and the upstream factors .
We did not detect PU.1-binding-site complexes that migrate more slowly than in vitro translated PU.1 , suggesting the absence of formation of a complex -88 -59 -33 V < -- -- - Region II -- -- -- > V « € -- -- - PU.1 -- -- - > V HUMAN C NAR CTCTH GCCTAGCTAAAAGGGGAAGAAGAGCGATC t44+ tt++44+ +44 ++4++4 t++4++4++4++4+4++ +44 CAATATTTCCAAATTCTGTAGTTCCCTTTCAGGCAAAAAAGGGGAAGAGGAG MURINE CCTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FIG .

Conservation of sequence similarity of the human and murine CSF-1 receptor promoters in the region II- and PU.1-binding domains .
Shown on the top line are the human region II ( -88 to -59 ) and PU.1 site ( the purine core is indicated ) ; shown on the bottom line is the murine promoter .
Identities are indicated with plus signs between the lines .
The murine gene contains an additional 23 bases , including a string of 20 adenine residues , between region II and the PU.1 site , which are not found in the human promoter .
These bases are shown below the murine sequence to preserve the alignment .
The bases in region II which were mutated to form mutant A and mutant B ( Fig .

between PU.1 and another factor .
Furthermore , PU.1 and the upstream factors bind with strong affinity to oligonucleotides that contain only single binding sites for either PU.1 or the two upstream factors , demonstrating that the factors can bind in vitro independently of each other .
Finally , mutations in the PU.1 site or the region II sites each decrease CSF-1 receptor promoter activity significantly , demonstrating that the PU.1 factor can not replace the Mono A or Mono B complex , and vice versa , in stimulating full promoter activity .
However , it is still possible that PU.1 and these upstream region binding factors interact , either through alterations in chromatin struc-ture , through contacts with non-DNA-binding coactivators , or through direct protein-protein contacts that are not stable in gel shift assays .
To find common themes governing myeloid gene regulation , it is interesting to consider the CSF-1 receptor promoter in comparison with that of CD11b , a myeloid cell-specific integrin receptor ( 2 , 15 , 16 ) .
Both lack TATAA boxes and have a functionally important PU.1 site 20 to 40 bp upstream of the major 5 ' transcription start site .
However , the presence of an important PU.1 site is unlikely to be the only significant factor in CSF-1 receptor promoter specificity , because PU.1 itself is expressed at high levels in both macrophages and B cells ( 6 ) .
In the case of the CSF-1 receptor , the promoter has a second functionally important binding region within 40 bp upstream of the PU.1 site , which binds to two factors highly expressed in monocytic cells .
These factors are not expressed at significant levels in B cells , perhaps explaining why the CSF-1 receptor is not expressed at high levels in B cells , despite the presence of high levels of PU.1 .
Our mutational analysis of the promoter ( Fig .
6 ) , in which mutations of either the Mono A or the Mono B site reduce promoter activity 87 % in the presence of an intact PU.1 site , further supports the idea that the region II-binding factors are critical for macrophage expression of the CSF-1 receptor .
To examine any possible functional relationship between Mono A and Mono B in directing CSF-1 receptor promoter activity , a construct which deleted both the Mono A-and the Mono B-binding sites simultaneously was used in transient transfections .
The promoter activity of the double-deletion construct was similar to that of constructs containing either the Mono A or Mono B site mutation individually .
This result indicates that Mono A and Mono B are both essential for monocyte-specific expression of the CSF-1 receptor .
The results reported here support the original observations of Roberts et al .
( 18 ) , indicating that a 550-bp fragment immediately upstream of the transcribed region of the human CSF-1 receptor gene can mediate tissue-specific expression in myelomonocytic cells .
Subsequent studies confirmed these results and demonstrated monocyte-specific transcriptional activity by nuclear run-on analysis ( 30 ) .
An entirely different model was recently proposed by Yue et al .
( 29 ) , who studied a similar region of the murine CSF-1 receptor gene .
They concluded that the gene contains a constitutively active promoter and that the macrophage-specific production of full-length mRNA is controlled by sequences in intron 2 that regulate transcript elongation .
Whether this discrepancy reflects inherent differences between the human and murine promoters is not clear , although the striking conservation between the two promoters in the region II- and PU.1-binding domains ( Fig .
8 ) suggests that they could direct monocyte-specific expression of both the murine and human CSF-1 receptors .
The concept of the CSF-1 promoter itself as the major determinant of tissue specificity is supported by the demonstration that the upstream fragment identified by Roberts et al .
( 18 ) directs macrophage-specific expression of the receptor in transgenic mice ( 8 ) .
Finally , we have shown that the Mor .

Mono A and Mono B protein complexes are preferentially detected in mobility shift assays in cells of the monocyte lineage and bind to sequence elements in region II of the promoter and that these sequences are required for tissue-specific expression of this promoter fragment .
Thus , the preponderance of data support the conclusion that the CSF-1 promoter sequences themselves are responsible for macrophage-specific expression of the CSF-1 receptor and certainly argue against the interpretation that the CSF-1 promoter is constitutively active in all cell types .
Further characterization of the region II-binding proteins should aid in elucidating the mechanism of how a small number of DNA-binding proteins within a small promoter region can mediate macrophage-specific expression .
