Bonde , Catherine Judelson , and Martin L. Privalsky '' Department of Microbiology , University of California , Davis , Davis , California 95616 Abstract The v-erb A oncogene of avian erythroblastosis virus is a mutated and virally transduced copy of a host cell gene encoding a thyroid hormone receptor .
The protein expressed by the v-erb A oncogene binds to DNA and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of both the thyroid hormone receptor and the closely related retinoic acid receptor .
The v-erb A protein has sustained two amino acid alterations within its DNA-binding domain relative to that of c-erb A , one of which , at serine 61 , is known to be important for v-erbh A function in the neoplastic cell .
We report here that the second alteration , at threonine 78 , also plays an important , although more indirect , role : alteration of the sequence at threonine 78 such that it resembles that of c-erb A can act as an intragenic suppressor and can partially restore function to a v-erb A protein rendered defective due to a mutation at position 61 .
Threonine 78 lies within the D-box of the v-erb A protein , a region thought to mediate receptor-receptor dimerizations , and is not in physical proximity to the serine at position 61 .
It therefore appears that an indirect interaction occurs between these two sites and that this interaction is crucial for v-erb A function .
Introduction AEV is a retrovirus which induces both erythroleukemias and fibrosarcomas in birds ( 1 ) .
Two distinct oncogenes are contained within the AEV genome : v-erb A and v-erb B , each of which represents transduced and altered copies of normal cellular loci ( 1 ) .
The v-erb B oncogene , derived from a host cell gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor , is both sufficient and necessary for oncogenic transformation ( 1 , 2 ) .
The v-erb A oncogene , in contrast , is not itself sufficient for oncogenic transformation but instead acts in neoplasia by blocking differentiation of infected erythroid cells and by altering the growth requirements of infected fibroblasts ( 1 , 3 ) .
The v-erb A oncogene is derived from c-erb Aa , a gene for a thyroid hormone receptor ( 4 , 5 ) .

mone receptors , in common with the closely related retinoid , vitamin D ; , and steroid receptors , act as hor-mone-regulated transcription factors , binding to specific DNA sequences ( termed hormone response elements ) and , in response to hormone ligand , modulating expression of adjacent target genes ( 6-8 ) .
All members of this nuclear hormone receptor family share a common modular structure consisting of a cysteine-rich `` zinc finger '' domain that confers DNA binding and a more COOH-terminal domain that binds the hormone ligand .
The DNA-binding `` zinc finger '' domain within these receptors consists of two a-helices folded and stabilized by interactions of conserved cysteines with coordinated zinc ions ( 9-11 ) .
The alteration of just three amino acids within the first zinc `` finger , '' termed the P-box , can exchange the DNA binding specificities of one receptor with another .
In contrast , the amino acids in the D-box , within the second zinc finger , are thought not to directly contact the DNA , but to play a more indirect role in binding of the receptor to DNA ( 12-14 ) .
Hormone response elements have been identified for the thyroid hormone , glucocorticoid , estrogen , and retinoic acid receptors ( 7 ) .
Generally , they consist of multiple copies of a `` half-site '' : a consensus hexa- or octanucleotide DNA sequence .
Both the actual nucleotide sequence of each half-site and the spacing and orientation between them are important for proper recognition of cognate hormone response elements by the nuclear hormone receptors ( 15 , 16 ) .
It has been proposed that whereas the actual sequence of the half-site is recognized by the P-box of the receptor , the D-box is involved in receptor-receptor dimerization and therefore in recognition of the spacing or orientation between the half-sites in the response element ( 12 , 14 , 16 ) .
The v-erb A allele is expressed as a viral gag-fusion protein and contains 13 internal missense mutations , as well as small amino- and carboxy-terminus deletions relative to the c-erb A progenitor ( 4 ) .
Although the v-erb A protein retains the ability to bind to DNA , the changes sustained within the v-erb A ligand-binding domain have seriously impaired its ability to bind thyroid hormone and to dictate transcription of target genes ( 17-20 ) .
As a consequence , in vertebrate cells , the v-erb A protein acts as a constitutive but somewhat promiscuous transcriptional repressor and can interfere in a dominant negative fashion with the actions of the estrogen , retinoic acid , and thyroid hormone receptors ( 18 , 19 , 21 , 22 ) .
This ability of the v-erb A protein to interfere with the actions of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors appears strongly linked , at least indirectly , to its mechanisms of action in the neoplastic cell ( 22-25 ) .
We are interested in the structural basis behind the different transcriptional properties of the v- and c-erb A proteins .
Although the changes sustained by the carboxy-terminus of the v-erb A protein are thought to play the principal role in the generation of the dominant negative 208 | intragenic Suppression within v-erb A ' o ¢ c- cl Ea K FFHRTIQKNLHPTYS ’ \ RFKKCISV 60 70 100 @ -s sic ( ® =t 78k Fig .

- Schematic representation of the v-erb A DNA-binding domain .
The sequence of the v-erb A DNA-binding domain is depicted in a manner to highlight the relationship of the two zinc atoms ( Zn ) to the cysteine motifs involved in the folding of this domain .
The standard one-letter amino acid code is used .
The P-box and D-box , encompassing amino acids involved in DNA recognition and dimerization by the steroid receptors , are also indicated .
The locations of the mutations created in this study , representing the change of serine 61 to a glycine and threonine 78 to a lysine , are displayed in bold face and by arrows .
phenotype of v-erb A , we have noted that two of the missense alterations between v- and c-erb A occur within very intriguing portions of the amino-terminal DNA-binding domain .
One of these alterations occurs at position 61 , a glycine codon in c-erb A but a serine codon in verb A , and lies within the crucial P-box sequence ( Fig .
1 ) .
Consistent with the importance of the P-box domain in DNA recognition , we have previously demonstrated that the ability of v-erb A to function in the cancer cell is dependent on the viral serine at this P-box site , and that replacement of the serine with the c-erb A-encoded glycine results in a significant loss in erythroid colony formation ( 26 ) .
The second location that differs between the DNA-binding domains of v- and c-erb A lies within the D-box , at a site thought critical for dimerization between receptor molecules : codon 78 encodes a threonine in v-erb A and a lysine in c-erb A ( Fig .
1 ) .
The functional significance of this alteration has not previously been explored .
In this report , we investigate the role of this second alteration between v- and c-erb A proteins , with a special focus on its importance in transcriptional regulation .
Results Alteration of the v-erb A DNA-binding Domain Sequence to That of c-erb A .
Of the two amino acid sites that differ in the DNA-binding domains of the v- and c-erb A proteins , one , at codon 61 within the P-box , has already been shown to be critical for v-erb A function ( 22 , 26 ) .
We began our investigation into the role of the second alteration , at codon 78 within the D-box , by using a site-directed mutagenesis approach .
The threonine codon at the base of the second zinc finger of v-erb A was changed to a lysine ( denoted T78K ) , making the v-erb A sequence identical to that of c-erb A at this site ( Fig .
1 ) .
A similarly altered v-erb A gene , but bearing the c-erb A sequence at the P-box codon 61 ( denoted S61G ) , was described previously ( 26 ) .
We also created a v-erb A allele combining these two single mutations to generate an S61G/T78K double mutation , resulting in a DNA 1 20 3 4 50 6 7 8s 9 10 Chlli = » mm .

Fibroblasts infected by the different AEV mutants were radiolabeled with `` S-amino acids , harvested , and lysed .
The lysates were immunoprecipitated with either preimmune serum ( Lanes 1 to 5 ) or with antiserum directed against a bacterially synthesized portion of the v-erb A protein ( Lanes 6 to 10 ) .
The immunoprecipitated proteins were subsequently analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography .
Analysis was performed on cells infected by the 82-t null mutant ( null , Lanes 1 and 6 ) , by the S61G mutant ( Lanes 2 and 7 ) , by the T78K mutant ( Lanes 3 and 8 } , by the S61G/T78K double mutant ( dbl , Lanes 4 and 9 ) , or by wild-type v-erb A virus ( wt , Lanes 5 and 10 ) .

Infectious AEV clones carrying these mutations were introduced into chick embryo fibroblasts , along with a RAV-1 helper virus ( AEV is defective for autonomous replication and requires a helper virus for propa-gation ) .
Supernatants of these primary transformants were used as a source of virus for subsequent infection of secondary fibroblasts and erythroid cells .
AEV bearing a v-erb A null mutation ( 82-t ) , a premature termination codon near the beginning of the v-erb A sequence , was characterized in parallel as a control .
Our first goal was to ascertain that the mutant AEV clones were both viable and capable of producing a stable v-erb A protein .
Avian fibroblasts infected by the different v-erb A mutants were radiolabeled with *°S-amino acids and lysed , and the v-erb A proteins were subsequently immunoprecipitated with an erb A-directed polyclonal antibody .
The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography .
The erb A-directed serum detected a protein of the appropriate size ( M , 75,000 , denoted p75 ) for the gag-v-erb A polypeptide in the lysates of cells infected with wild-type , S61G , T78K , or the S61G/T78K viral mutants ( Fig .

© Calculated by dividing the number of erythroid colonies in each experiment by the fibroblast-transforming capabilities of each viral stock ( as determined in `` Materials and Methods '' ) , to compensate for any potential variation in viral titer , ¢ Compact versus diffuse morphology was determined by microscopic evaluation of the methylcellulose medium assays .
Examples of the differing morphologies are shown in Fig .

in contrast , the p75 protein was not detected in the lysate of cells infected by the v-erb A 82-t null mutant ( Fig .
2 , Lane 6 ) , nor was the p75 v-erb A protein detected by preimmune serum ( Fig .
2 , Lanes 1 to 5 ) .
The additional protein , approximately 48 kilodaltons in size , detected in high abundance in Lane 10 , is also detectable at low levels in several of the immunoprecipitates utilizing preimmune serum ; its relatively higher abundance in the wild-type protein sample shown here is not a reproducible feature of these immunoprecipitations .
The T78K Mutation Alone Does Not Have a Significant Effect on v-erb A-mediated Erythroid Transformation , but , Unexpectedly , Is Able to Partially Suppress the Defect Resulting from the §61G Mutation .
The transforming properties of each v-erb A mutant were evaluated using a methylcellulose growth assay : chicken bone marrow cells were infected with AEV carrying the various v-erb A mutations , the cells were then placed into methylcellulose media , and colony formation was monitored .
We used relatively simple medium in these assays , unsupplemented by anemic chicken serum , tumor growth factor- « , insulin , or erythropoietin .
Since a functional v-erb A gene is required for erythroid cell proliferation under these conditions , the number of erythroid colonies produced by each virus reflects the activity of the different v-erb A alleles ( 26 ) .
To compensate for possible differences in viral titer among the different mutant and wild-type virus stocks , we have normalized the erythroid-transforming ability of each of our mutant viral stocks to the fibroblast-transforming ability of the same stock ( a property of the unaltered v-erb B locus ) .
However , our overall conclusions would be essentially the same whether the normalized or original data were analyzed : comparable numbers of transformed fibroblast colonies were obtained for all of the AEV clones , indicating that the v-erb B gene was intact and that viral replication was not affected by the v-erb A mutations ( Table 1 , and data not shown ) .
Consistent with previous results , virus bearing the wild-type v-erb A gene generated a large number of 1 5 .

AEV stocks , bearing the different v-erb A alleles , were tested for the ability to induce erythroid colonies .

erythroid colonies under these conditions , whereas the v-erb A 82 -t null mutant was totally inactive in the assay ( Fig .
3 ) .
Virus carrying the single S61G v-erb A lesion yielded an approximately 5-fold reduction in its ability to induce erythroid colonies compared to wild-type , in keeping with the significantly impaired function previously reported for this mutant allele ( 26 ) .
In contrast , the T78K mutant produced erythroid colonies at a normalized efficiency near that of wild-type levels , indicating that the substitution of the c-erb A lysine for the v-erb A threonine had only a minor effect on v-erb A function .
On this basis , we anticipated that the double lesion , S61G/T78K , would exhibit a defect equal to , or perhaps slightly more severe than , that of the S61G lesion alone .
Unexpectedly , the S61G/T78K double mutant consistently showed improved erythroid cell-transforming capabilities ( 41 % of wild-type levels ) when compared to the S61G mutation alone ( 20 % of wild-type levels ) .
Thus , although the T78K alteration by itself had little or no direct effect on erythroid transformation , combination of the T78K lesion with the defective S61G mutation appeared to partially restore the oncogenic capabilities of v-erb A .
This apparent intragenic suppression was reproducible and was observed as a 2-fold enhancement in three separate assays , each performed in duplicate .
The morphology of the erythroid cell colonies was also seen to vary with the different v-erb A alleles and provided an additional confirmation of the intragenic suppression phenomenon ( Table 1 ; Fig .
4 ) .
Virtually all of the erythroid colonies induced by wild-type v-erb A virus exhibited a tightly compacted and condensed morphology ( Fig .
4A ) .
The T78K mutation also yielded compact colonies indistinguishable in appearance from those induced by the wild-type v-erb A allele ( Fig .
4C ) .

Morphology of representative - erythroid - colonies .
Erythroid cell colonies induced by the different AEV mutants were photographed through a phase microscope .
Shown are typical colonies induced by the wild-type virus ( A ) , the S61G mutant ( B ) , and the T78K mutant ( C ) , as well as two colonies of differing morphology induced by the S61G/T7BK double mutant { D and F ) .
contrast , the S61G single mutant yielded very diffuse colonies surrounded by a halo of sparse cells , with less than 10 % of the colonies exhibiting the condensed , wild-type appearance ( Table 1 ; Fig .
4B ) .
Intriguingly , the colonies induced by the S61G/T78K double mutant were largely of the compact , wild-type morphology ( Fig .
46 ) , with only a low percentage ( approximately 15 % ) of the more diffuse phenotype characteristic of the S61G allele alone ( Table 1 ; Fig .
4D ) .
These results again intimate that T78K mutation may act to significantly repair the functional defect in the S61G mutant gene .
The T78K Mutation Restores the Ability of the S61G Mutant to Interfere with Transcription .
A fundamental aspect of v-erb A protein function appears to be its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor and to interfere with the actions of other nuclear receptors ( 18 , 19 , 22 ) .
The ability of v-erb A to repress the actions of the retinoic acid receptors , in particular , may be linked to v-erb A function in the neoplastic cell ( 22-25 ) .
Therefore , we next tested the ability of our different v-erb A mutant alleles to interfere with retinoic acid receptor action in a transient transfection assay .
Expression plasmids bearing the different v-erb A mutant alleles were introduced into MCF-7 cells together with a retinoic acid-responsive reporter gene ( RRE , , , -tkCAT ) .

Inhibition of retinoic acid receptor function by mutant and wild-type v-erb A proteins .
A pRS-v-erb A expression vector containing a wild-type or mutant v-erb A allele , as indicated , was introduced into MCF-7 cells together with a RREp , -tkCAT reporter gene .
The cells were subsequently exposed ( hatched columns ) or not ( solid columns ) to retinoic acid and incubated an additional 30 h , and CAT activity , relative to an internal B-galactosidase control , was determined .
The average of four separate experiments is presented .
Abbreviations are as in Fig .
3. to the medium , and the cells were subsequently assayed for reporter gene expression .
As expected , the endogenous retinoic acid receptors in the MCF-7 cells mediated a strong RA-dependent induction of reporter gene expression that was not affected by introduction of a plasmid bearing the 82-t verb A-null gene ( Fig .
5 ) .
Introduction of the wild-type verb A allele , on the other hand , strongly inhibited this RA activation , consistent with previous work ( 22 ) .
The T78K mutant appeared to function as well as , if not slightly better than , wild-type v-erb A in this assay , efficiently interfering with RA activation of the reporter , whereas the single S61G lesion significantly impaired the ability of the v-erb A protein to repress RA receptor action .
In contrast to the §61G single lesion , the S61G/T78K double mutant was able to effectively inhibit RA action in the MCF-7 cells , repressing reporter gene expression virtually as well as the wild-type v-erb A protein .
Our results suggest that in this transcriptional repression assay , as in the erythroid colony assay , the T7Z8K mutation appears to compensate for the defect due to the S61G lesion .
Parallel aliquots of the transiently transfected cells were also radiolabeled with **S-amino acids and subjected to an immunoprecipitation analysis using erb A-directed antibodies .
This analysis revealed that detectable levels of v-erb A protein were synthesized by all of the con-structs , with the expected exception of the 82-t null mutant , and that the relative ability to repress RA activity was not related to simple differences in the amount of verb A protein expressed by the different mutants ( data not shown ) .
The Subcellular Localization of v-erb A Does Not Appear to Be Altered by the S61G or T78K Mutations .
Subcellular localization of wild-type v-erb A is bimodal , with 60 to 70 % localized to the nucleus in AEV-infected cells and the remaining 30 to 40 % distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm ( 27 ) .
It has been demonstrated previously that nuclear accumulation of v-erb A protein is necessary for v-erb A function ( 28 ) .
To verify that the S61G and T78K mutations did not achieve their effects through altering the subcellular localization of the v-erb A protein , immunofluorescent staining was performed on AEV-infected fibroblasts .
Preimmune sera yielded only low background fluorescence for cells infected by any of the v-erb A mutant forms of AEV ( data not shown ) .
Cells infected with the 82-t null mutant also showed only a low level of background fluorescence , as expected ( Fig .
6A ) .
The wild-type v-erb A gave intense staining , with most of the signal localized to the nucleoplasm , and the rest distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig .
6B ; Ref .
27 ) .
The S61G , T78K , and S61G/T78K mutants all gave staining patterns virtually indistinguishable from that of wild-type v-erb A ( Fig .
6 , C to FE ) .
Therefore , the differing abilities of our v-erb A mutants to transform erythroid cells and repress retinoic acid receptor function are probably not due to alterations in the subcellular localization of the v-erb A polypeptide .
It should be noted that our immunofluorescence localization experiments were performed in avian fibroblasts ; our previous analyses , however , have indicated that there are no detectable differences between v-erb A protein localization in erythroid and in fibroblast cells ( 27 ) .
The T78K Mutation Yields a DNA Binding Pattern Similar to That of Wild-Type v-erb A .
The DNA binding capabilities of the v-erb A mutants were determined using a combined DNA binding/immunoprecipitation ( McKay-type ) assay .
AEV-infected fibroblast lysates were incubated with radiolabeled DNA fragments derived from the rat growth hormone gene ; this gene has a number of binding sites for v- and c-erb A proteins .
The v-erb A proteins , as well as any associated DNA fragments , were subsequently immunoprecipitated with erb A-directed antisera , the immunoprecipitates were washed , and the bound DNA fragments were released and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis /autoradiography .
Only faint background binding , principally of the DNA fragments a and b , was seen with the 82-t null mutant or by use of preimmune serum ( Fig .
7A , Lanes 1 and 2 ) .
In contrast , the wild-type v-erb A protein ( Lane 6 ) exhibited strong binding to DNA fragments c , f , and h , each of which contains a TRE binding site and has previously been shown to be bound by the v- and c-erb A polypeptides ( 20 ) .
The T78K mutant demonstrated a DNA binding pattern essentially identical to that of wild-type v-erb A in this assay ( Lane 4 ) .
In contrast , the S61G mutant exhibited a consistently , if subtly , altered DNA binding pattern , with fragments h and f bound more weakly and fragment d bound somewhat more strongly than is seen for the wild-type protein ( Fig .
7A , Lane 3 ; Ref .
26 ) .
This is most clearly observed in a quantitation by densitometry ( Fig .
7B ) .
The S61G/T78K double mutant appeared to display a mixture of traits in this assay , more closely duplicating the stronger binding of fragments f and h exhibited by the wild-type protein , but retaining the higher binding of fragment d seen for the single S61G mutant ( Fig .
7A , Lane 5 , and 7B ) .
It is unlikely that these results reflect differences in the ability of the antisera to recognize the mutant v-erb A proteins , rather than genuine differences in DNA binding by the mutant v-erb A polypeptides : all mutant and wild-type v-erb A proteins interacted strongly with the anti-erb A antibody , and 212 | intragenic Suppression within v-erb A A. null B. wild type Fig .

The v-erb A protein , on the other hand , does not function in regulating appropriate cell behavior , but rather acts as a constitutive repressor in vertebrates and mediates inappropriate cell growth and differentiation .
How do the relatively few structural differences between v-erb A and c-erb A confer such significantly different phenotypes ?
Our work seeks to address this question by investigating the significance of the structural differences in the DNA-binding domains of v- and c-erb A proteins and the role of these changes in the origin of the v-erb A oncoprotein from the c-erb A hormone receptor .
We focus here on two amino acids that differ in v- and c-erb A , codons 61 and 78 , and that appear able to interact to alter the function of the encoded polypeptide .
Replacement of the Threonine 78 of v-erb A with the c-erb A Lysine Exhibits Little or No Phenotypic Effect in a Wild-Type Background but Can Partly Reverse the Defect Induced by a Second Site Mutation .
All known c-erb A alleles encode a lysine within the D-box element , at a site where the v-erb A allele encodes a threonine ( 6 , 8 ) .
To address the question of the relationship between this change and v-erb A function in the cancer cell , we replaced the threonine at this position in the v-erb A protein with the c-erb A-encoded lysine .
This single `` back '' mutation , T78K , had little or no observable effect on the encoded protein .
Virus bearing the T78K mutation induced erythroid colonies nearly identical in number and morphology to those induced by wild-type v-erb A ; the T78K-encoded protein exhibited a subcellular distri-bution , DNA binding properties , and transcriptional repression capabilities virtually indistinguishable from those of the wild-type v-erb A protein .
The T78K mutant was therefore dramatically different in its properties from our serine to glycine mutation at position 61 within the P-box , an alteration which leads to significant disruptions of the transcriptional and oncogenic functions of the verb A protein .
Our results initially suggested that the difference between v- and c-erb A protein at codon 78 might be a neutral mutation , the result of genetic drift occurring from the time of divergence of the viral from the cellular allele .
However , extension of our analysis to a S61G/ T78K double mutant demonstrated that the T78K lesion does have significant effects on phenotype in this genetic background .
The double mutant consistently exhibited an erythroid colony-transforming potential closer to that of wild-type , both in terms of colony number and mor-phology , than did the S61G single mutation , suggesting that the T78K lesion was , in effect , an intragenic suppressor of the S61G defect .
This ability of the T78K lesion to restore function to the S61G defect was also demonstrated by the capacity of the S61G/T78K double mutant to repress retinoic acid receptor action in transient trans-fections , an assay in which the S61G single mutant possessed only severely limited activity .
The S61G/T78K double mutant , encoding a glycine at position 61 and a lysine at position 78 , creates a DNA-binding domain identical to that of the c-erb A thyroid hormone receptor .
It is important to note , therefore , that the S61G/T78K mutant does not appear to fully mimic all of the activities of the wild-type v-erb A gene in our assays , suggesting that the presence of a serine at position 61 and a threonine at position 78 confers on the wild-type v-erb A protein detectably greater function in the neoplastic cell than the c-erb A sequence from which it is derived .
This conclusion is supported by evidence obtained in other systems that the DNA-binding domains of v- and c-erb A are not functionally equivalent ( 21 , 29 ) .
We conclude that ( a ) the amino acids in the P- and D-box must be compatible with one another for v-erb A 214 intragenic Suppression within v-erb A function , and ( b ) both sites contribute to the ability of the viral allele to participate fully in oncogenesis .
Nature of the Functional Interaction between the P-and D-Boxes in v-erb A .
It is intriguing that amino acids located at two separated sites in the v-erb A primary sequence ( codons 61 and 78 ) can have such profound and interconnected influences on protein function .
Studies on other nuclear hormone receptors have provided additional evidence for complementary interactions between amino acids in the D-box and the P-box participating in the DNA binding and functional properties of these receptors .
For example , altering the DNA binding specificity of the glucocorticoid receptor to that of the thyroid hormone receptor requires changes to both the P- and D-box sequences , whereas either change alone leads to an inactive receptor ( 14 ) .
Conversely , joining the P-box sequence from a glucocorticoid receptor with a D-box { and flanking region ) derived from the estrogen receptor produces a novel receptor with a promiscuous ability to recognize both glucocorticoid and estrogen response elements ( 12 ) .
What are the roles of the P- and D-box elements , and how might they functionally interact ?
Although three-dimensional structural data are not available for either the c-erb A or v-erb A protein , reasonable predictions can be made based on structural studies of the closely related glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors ( 9-11 ) .
The DNA-binding domain of the nuclear hormone receptors is thought to be dominated by two a-helices .
The first helix , which includes the P-box , appears to lie within the major groove of the DNA binding site and is able to make base-specific contacts with the hormone response element .
One P-box amino acid in particular , equivalent to codon 61 in v- and c-erb A , is in a position to make a critical base pair contact with the DNA response element and appears to play a central role in the ability of the receptor to discriminate among different DNA sequences ( 11 ) .
This structural analysis strongly confirms our genetic evidence and highlights the importance of differences in the codon 61 position for v- and c-erb A function .
The second a-helix ( nearer the carboxy-terminus of the re-ceptor ) is oriented along the DNA axis and can make several nonspecific contacts with the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA molecule .
The D-box , in contrast , does not directly contact the DNA but instead forms a portion of an important interface that appears to mediate receptor-receptor dimeri-zation , consistent with biochemical evidence indicating that the nuclear receptors bind to their DNA sites as dimers ( 11 , 30 ) .
It has been further proposed that the D-box-mediated interactions between receptor dimers may determine the ability of the receptors to recognize the spacing between DNA half-sites ( 7 , 16 ) .
It is provocative that the second amino acid difference in the DNA-binding domains of v- and c-erb A , at position 78 , occurs in this D-box region .
How do the P- and D-box elements interact , and how can we account for the intragenic suppression phenomenon reported here ?
The predicted tertiary structure of the nuclear receptors suggests that the P- and D-box elements are not in close physical proximity to one another .
Instead , we propose an indirect interaction .
Evidence indicates that binding of the v-erb A protein to the DNA is necessary for its ability to interfere with the functions of other nuclear hormone receptors .
We sug- gest that the wild-type v-erb A protein binds to one of the half-sites in a hormone response element and pre-vents , by protein-protein interactions , the functional binding of a retinoic acid or thyroid hormone receptor to the other half-site .
Alterations in the P-box , such as the S61G mutation described here , would lead to changes in the interaction between the v-erb A protein and the DNA : these may be manifested either as a change in the tertiary structure of the v-erb A protein itself , or perhaps as an alteration in the precise orientation of the v-erb A protein on the DNA .
The S61G v-erb A protein would therefore be unable to make the protein-protein contacts necessary for interfering with the actions of a second , functional hormone receptor on the adjacent half-site .
Mutation of the D-box threonine 78 to a lysine would , by changing the dimerization interface , restore the ability of v-erb A to act as a repressor , thereby reinstating both biochemical and biological function .
Materials and Methods Construction of Mutants .
A 1.2-kilobase Xhol to Sail fragment from the molecularly cloned AEV genome was inserted into the M13 mp18 vector to serve as a single-stranded template for the mutagenesis protocol ( 26 ) .
The v-erb A threonine codon at position 78 was changed to the c-erb A lysine codon by the dut/ung method of Kunkel ( Bio-Rad Mutagene kit ) , using a 5'-CACCC ATCGT ACTTG CAGGA GTAGG-3 `` ' oligonucleotide containing a single base mismatch ( underlined ) relative to the wild-type sequence .
The resulting v-erb A mutation , denoted T78K , was identified by DNA sequence analysis of individual M13 clones .
The genetic lesion was next transferred to a pUC vector to permit easy isolation of double-stranded DNA and , by use of intermediate con-structs , was ultimately reconstructed into a molecular clone of the entire avian erythroblastosis virus genome ( denoted pAEV-11-3L ) for the generation of infectious virus stocks ( 26 , 31 ) .
The T78K mutation was also engineered into a pRSV-v-erb A expression vector for transient transfection studies ( 18 ) .
Generation of the S61G mutants has been previously described , and the creation of the S61G/T78K double lesion was achieved by simultaneous use of both mutant oligonucleotides in the M13 mutagenesis protocol .
The 82-t null mutation is the result of introduction of a termination codon after base pair 82 ( codon 27 ) in the v-erb A coding sequence ( 28 ) .
The identities of the final pAEV-11-3L and pRSV-v-erb A vector constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis .
Cells and Virus .
Chicken fibroblasts and MCF-7 human mammary carcinoma cells were isolated and propagated as previously described ( 22 , 26 ) .
The avian fibroblasts were transfected with wild-type or mutant forms of pAEV-11-3L by a calcium phosphate precipitation method , together with an infectious molecular clone of Rous-associated virus-1 ( RAV-1 ) to serve as a helper virus ( 31 ) .
Virus stocks isolated from these primary transfec-tions were used in subsequent studies .
The effects of the viral mutations on erythroid colony formation were determined by infection of chick bone marrow cells in a methylcellulose medium colony assay ( 26 ) .
Three separate assays were performed , with duplicate plates in each .
Fibroblast-transforming titers of the AEV stocks were determined by serial dilution and measure of an Cell Growth & Differentiation chorage-independent colony formation in a soft agar growth assay ( 26 ) .
Biochemical Assays .
The ability of the v-erb A mutants to interfere with retinoic acid receptor function was assayed in MCF-7 cells , using the previously described pRSV-v-erb A expression construct and a reporter gene composed of the palindromic retinoic acid response element linked to a thymidine kinase promoter and the CAT gene ( pRRE , ,-tkCAT ) ( 22 ) .
The expression and reporter plasmids , together with a pRSV-lacZ plasmid to serve as an internal standard , were introduced into the MCF-7 cells by electroporation , and the cells were subsequently exposed or not ( as indicated ) to retinoic acid and harvested 24 to 30 h later ( 22 ) .
CAT activity was determined and was normalized to the -galactosidase activity assayed in parallel ( 22 ) .
Analysis of v-erb A-encoded protein synthesis was performed by radiolabeling cells for 3 to 4 h with *°S-amino acids ; either stably infected avian fibroblasts or transiently transfected MCF-7 cells were used .
The v-erb A-related polypeptides were isolated by immunoprecipitation of the radiolabeled cell lysates , subsequently separated by sodium dodecyl !
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and visualized by fluorography ( 26 , 27 ) .
The amount of each lysate subjected to immunoprecipitation was normalized to total protein synthesis , as determined by a hot trichloroacetic acid precipitation procedure .
Immunofluorescent subcellular localization of the verb A protein was performed on formalin-fixed and de-tergent-permeabilized fibroblasts , using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a bacterially produced fragment of v-erb A ( 26 , 27 ) .
The DNA binding properties of the mutants were assayed using a McKay-type immunoprecipitation assay as previously described ( 20 ) , except that the gels were dried directly onto filter paper rather than blotted onto membranes .
Briefly , unlabeled cell extracts containing the v-erb A protein were incubated with *°P-radiolabeled DNA fragments ; these were derived from the rat growth hormone gene and contain appropriate binding sites for the v-erb A protein ( TREs ) .
The v-erb A proteins and any associated DNA fragments were then immunoprecipitated with erb A-directed antiserum , the DNA fragments were released from the v-erb A protein by SDS treatment , and the DNA molecules were resolved by 2 % agarose-0.1 % SDS-gel electrophoresis .
