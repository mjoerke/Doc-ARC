Received 10 June 1998/Returned for modification 13 August 1998/Accepted 14 October 1998 Class II major histocompatibility ( class II ) genes are regulated in a B-cell-specific and gamma interferon-inducible fashion .
The master switch for the expression of these genes is the class II transactivator ( CHITA ) .
In this report , we demonstrate that one of the functions of CIITA is to recruit the CREB binding protein ( CBP ) to class II promoters .
Not only functional but also specific binding interactions between CIITA and CBP were demonstrated .
Moreover , a dominant negative form of CBP decreased the activity of class II promoters and levels of class II determinants on the surface of cells .
Finally , the inhibition of class II gene expression by the glucocorticoid hormone could be attributed to the squelching of CBP by the glucocorticoid receptor .
We conclude that CBP , a histone acetyltransferase , plays an important role in the transcription of class II genes .
The expression of major histocompatibility ( MHC ) complex class II ( class II ) genes is controlled at the level of transcrip-tion .
Their coordinate B-cell-specific and gamma interferon-inducible expression is dictated by shared cis-acting elements in their promoters .
At least four conserved sequences , called the S , X , X2 , and Y boxes , have been identified ( reviewed in references 2 and 33 ) .
With the help of the heterotrimeric nuclear factor Y complex , which binds to the Y box ( 29 , 42 , 52 ) , the multimeric regulatory factor X ( RFX ) complex binds specifically to S and X boxes ( 15 , 21 ) .
The X2 binding protein also facilitates the binding of RFX to these conserved upstream sequences ( CUS ) ( 30 , 34 , 41 ) .
The occupancy of these CUS is necessary but not sufficient for the transcription of class II genes ( 25 ) ; expression of the class II transactivator ( CHTA ) is also required ( 48-50 ) .
CHTA is a 125-kDa transcriptional coactivator which does not bind to DNA directly ( 49 ) but interacts with protein complexes on CUS .
Its C-terminal 800 amino acids interact with these DNA-bound proteins ( 43 , 55 ) .
Indeed , weak interactions between CIITA and RFX5 , which is the largest subunit of RFX , have been described previously ( 45 ) .
The N terminus of CHTA contains a transcriptional activation domain of 143 amino ac-ids , which is rich in acidic amino acids ( 43 , 55 ) .
Mutational analyses of this region identified two putative « helices which are required for the activation of transcription by CIITA ( 18 ) .
They bind to the 32-kDa subunit of TFIID , TAF , ,32 , and presumably activate transcription by recruiting TFIID to the promoter ( 18 ) .
CHTA also recruits the B-cell-specific coactivator Bob-1 ( also known as OBF-1 or OCA-B ) , thereby increasing the expression of class II genes in B cells ( 17 ) .
The CREB binding protein ( CBP ) , which interacts directly with the phosphorylated form of CREB , was identified as a coactivator for the transcription of cyclic AMP-responsive genes ( 13 , 27 ) .
Subsequently , many other transcription factors were found to interact with CBP ( reviewed in reference 19 ) .

941 Direct binding of CBP to these transcription factors was also demonstrated ( reviewed in reference 22 ) .
CBP activates transcription through its histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) activity ( 7 , 38 ) and its ability to recruit additional proteins p/CAF ( 53 ) and ACTR ( 11 ) , which also possess HAT activities .
Additionally , CBP can acetylate general transcription factors ( 20 ) , which may contribute to its transcriptional effects .
Finally , CBP binds to RNA helicase A and thereby RNA polymerase II holoenzyme ( 26 , 36 ) as well as other general transcription factors , which include TATA-binding protein ( 3 , 14 ) and TFIIB ( 27 ) .
Thus , it appears that CBP activates transcription by more than one mechanism .
In this study , we identified CBP as a cofactor for the transcription of class II genes .
We found that CIITA and CBP cooperate synergistically in the activation of transcription from the DRA promoter .
These two proteins also bound to each other directly , and these interactions were highly specific .
Moreover , a dominant negative form of CBP , ( DN-CBP ) blocked the increased expression of class II genes by CBP .
Finally , the inhibition of class II transcription by dexamethasone , which is a glucocorticoid hormone , was reversed by the overexpression of CBP , indicating that it could have resulted from the squelching of CBP by the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) .
From this and previous studies , it appears that CIHITA organizes multiple transcriptional activities , integrating inputs from sequence-specific DNA-bound proteins with various effector pathways to regulate the expression of class II genes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and transfection .
The human kidney fibroblast cell line 293T and African green monkey kidney cell line COS were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with 10 % fetal calf serum and streptomycin-penicillin .
The human B-lymphoblastoid cell line RM3 was maintained in RPMI with 10 % fetal calf serum and streptomycin-penicillin .
All cells were grown at 37°C with 5 % CO ; .
Transfection of 293T and COS cells was carried out with 1 or 2 ug of plasmid DNA ( including 10 ng of a plasmid expressing hCG as a transfection control ) and Lipofectamine ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , Md . )
according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
RM3 cells were transfected by electroporation ( 300 V , 975 pF ) with 20 ug of plasmid DNA including 1 g of pEGFP ( Clontech , Palo Alto , Calif. ) .
Plasmid DNA construction .
pSVCIITA , pSGCIITA , and pDRASCAT ( 17 ) and pCMVCBP ( a gift from M. G. Rosenfeld ) ( 24 ) were previously described .
Plasmids expressing glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -CBP fusion proteins were constructed as follows .
The appropriate region of CBP was amplified by PCR 942 FONTES ET AL .
using primers containing BamHI ( 5 ' end ) and XhoI ( 3 ' end ) sites .
These amplified DNAs were digested with BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into plasmid pGEX4T3 ( Promega Inc. , Madison , Wis. ) cut with the same enzymes .
Each CBP insert was sequenced to verify identity .
The primers for PCR were as follows : GST-CBP ( 1-101 ) , 5-CGCGGATCCATGGCTGAGAACTTGC and 5'-GCAC TCGAGCTAGCCACCCAGGCCCTG ; GST-CBP ( 461-661 ) , 5 '' -CGCGGATCC GGCACAGGGCAACAG and 5'-GCACCGGAGCTATATCTTGTAGATTIT TCTC ; GST-CBP ( 1621-1891 ) , 5'- CGCGGATCCTGTATGCCACCATGG and 5-GCACTGGAGCTAGCCTCCCATCGCCTGC ; and GST-CBP ( 2058-2163 ) , 5-CGCGGATCCCCACCCAGGAGGATCTCACC and 5 '' -GCACTCGAGCT ATGTCTTGCGATTATAG .
( Numbers in parentheses denote amino acids positions spanned by the CBP constructs . )
Plasmid pCRDN-CBP was constructed by amplifying CBP cDNA sequences from nucleotides 5709 to 7323 , adding an ATG start codon and consensus sequence immediately preceding amino acid 1903 of CBP , and subcloning the amplified product directly into plasmid pCR3.1 ( InVitrogen , Carlsbad , Calif. ) .
The CBP was sequenced to verify its identity .
The primers for PCR were 5 % -GCCGCCACCATGCCGCAGCCCCCTGCCCaAG and 5'-CTACAAGCCCTCCACAAACTTC .
Reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR ( RT-PCR ) .
Total RNA was isolated from transfected 293T cells by the guanidinium acid-phenol chloroform method ( 12 ) .
Reverse transcription was performed with 1 pg of total RNA , 1 pg of oligo ( dT ) ( Bochringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , Ind .
) , and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
One microliter of the reverse transcriptase reaction was used as the template in a PCR with 1 U of Teg polymerase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) in a 50-pl reaction according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
The reaction conditions were 94°C for 30 s , 55°C for 30 s , and 72°C for 30 s for 25 cycles .
Then 10 ul of each reaction product was run on a 1.5 % agarose gel .
The primers for CIITA were previously described ( 10 ) .
The primers for human TAP1 were 5'-AGGTAGACGAGGCTGGGAGCC and 5 '' -CATTCTGGAGCATCTGCA GG .
CAT assay and FACS analysis .
The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) assay was performed exactly as previously described ( 18 ) .
Forty-eight hours after the transfection , RM3 cells were stained for human class II and class I determinants with monoclonal antibodies raised against HLA-DP ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , Calif ) and HLA-A , -B , and -C ( Pharmingen , San Diego , Calif. ) determinants , respectively .
After washing , cells were incubated with a phyco-erythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse antibody ( Zymed , Los Angeles , Calif. ) .
Flu-orescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) analyses were performed on a FACS-calibur apparatus ( Becton Dickinson ) .
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting .
Forty-cight hours after transfection , COS cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 % Nonidet P40 , 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , and protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 20 min at 4°C .
Cell lysates were then cleared at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C , and supernatants were incubated with 10 al of anti-CBP antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , Calif. ) for 1 h at 4°C .
Samples were then mixed with 15 pl of protein A-conjugated agarose beads for another hour , and immunoprecipitates were washed four times and resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer .
Protein samples were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis ( PAGE ) on an 8 % gel and transferred to nitrocellulose , using a Bio-Rad ( Hercules , Calif. ) Western blotting apparatus .
One-quarter of the lysate used for the immunoprecipitation was also examine for the presence of CBP and CIITA in transfected cells .
Membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 % nonfat milk overnight and incubated with primary antibodies ( anti-hemagglutinin epitope [ 12CA5 ] and anti-CBP ) for at least 1 h. After three washes with Tris-buffered saline ( pH 7.4 ) containing 5 % nonfat milk , membranes were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h , washed with the same buffer , and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence assay ( ECL kit ; Amersham , Arlington Heights , II . ) .
GST pull-down assays .
GST-CBP fusion proteins were produced and purified , and GST pull-down assays between GST-CBP and in vitro-transcribed and -translated CIITA and CIITA deletions were performed exactly as described elsewhere ( 18 ) .
RESULTS CBP and CIITA increase expression from the DRA promoter synergistically .
Previous studies demonstrated that CBP facilitates the transcriptional activation of a wide variety of genes via its HAT domain ( reviewed in reference 22 ) and its ability to interact with general transcription factors ( 3 , 14 , 26 , 27 , 36 ) .
To determine if CBP could also activate class II genes and if it cooperated with CIITA , transient expression assays were performed with the human kidney fibroblast cell line 293T .
Plasmid effectors coding for CIITA ( pSVCIITA ) and CBP ( pCMVCBP ) were cotransfected with the plasmid target pDRASCAT .
CAT enzymatic assays were performed 48 h later .

CHITA and CBP act synergistically to increase expression from the DRA promoter .
The plasmid target ( pDRASCAT ) was coexpressed with CIITA and/or CBP in 293T cells ( + denotes protein expression ) .
Amounts of cotransfected plasmid DNA were held constant ( 0.25 pg of each plasmid effector and target , balanced to a total of to 1.0 mg with the empty plasmid vector DNA ) .
pDRASCAT was coexpressed with empty plasmid vector ( white bar ) , CIITA ( gray bar ) , CBP ( striped bar ) , or CIITA and CBP ( black bar ) .
Fold transactivation ( Fold-TA ) was calculated from the bar graph and represents values of top bars over the value obtained with pDRASCAT alone .
CAT activities represent mean values of three independent experiments performed in triplicate with indicated standard errors of the mean .
RT-PCR was performed on total RNA isolated from 293T cells transfected as noted above .
Primers for CIITA mRNA ( B , top ; from nucleotide positions 3309 to 3507 ) or human TAP1 ( bottom ; from nucleotide positions 1904 to 2247 ) were used in the PCR .
CIITA increased the expression from the DRA promoter fivefold over baseline levels ( Fig .
1A , column 2 ) .
CBP had a smaller effect , transactivating the DRA promoter only threefold ( column 3 ) .
However , when coexpressed , CIITA and CBP transactivated the DRA promoter 15-fold ( column 4 ) .
To rule out that CBP increased the transcription of CIITA in 293T cells , total RNA was isolated from the cotransfected 293T cells and subjected to RT-PCR .
CIITA mRNA was found to be present in equal amounts when plasmid pSVCIITA was transfected into 293T cells , regardless of the presence of pCMVCBP ( Fig .
1B , top , lanes 2 to 4 ) .
Control RT-PCR was also performed with primers complementary to the ubiquitously expressed human TAP1 gene ( Fig .
1B , bottom ) .
These controls indicated that CBP did not affect expression from the DRA promoter due to increased transcription of CIITA .
We conclude that both CBP and CIITA transactivate the DRA promoter and do so in a synergistic manner .
CIITA interacts directly with CBP in cells .
Since functional interactions between CIITA and CBP could reflect physical interactions between the two proteins , we performed a modified one-hybrid binding assay in 293T cells .
An effector plasmid directing expression of the fusion protein between CIITA and the DNA binding domain of the yeast Gal4 protein ( pSGCIITA ) was cotransfected with a reporter plasmid containing a single Gal4 binding site ( UASg ) linked to the CAT reporter gene ( pG1bCAT ) ( 28 ) .
The hybrid Gal4-CIITA protein increased the expression from pG1bCAT threefold over baseline levels ( Fig .
2A , column 2 ) .
However , inclusion of pCMVCBP in the cotransfection transactivated pGIbCAT 18-fold , indicating that CBP interacted directly with CIITA ( column 3 ) .
pCMVCBP without pSGCIITA had no effect on the transcription form pG1bCAT ( column 4 ) .
Direct interactions between CIITA and CBP could also be demonstrated in COS cells , Vor .

( B ) CIITA can be immunoprecipitated with CBP in cells .
COS cells were transfected with pCMVCBP ( 1.0 mg ) alone ( lane 1 ) or with pCMVCBP ( 1.0 ug ) and pSVCIITA ( 1.0 ug ) ( lane 2 ) .
The empty plasmid vector was included to maintain the total amount of transfected plasmid at 2.0 ug .
One-quarter of the cellular lysate used for the immunoprecipitation ( IP ) was examined for the presence of expressed proteins ( Input ) .
Anti-CBP ( « CBP ) immunoprecipitates were also probed for the presence of CIITA by Western blotting , « HA , anti-hemagglutinin epitope antibody .
which were cotransfected with pCMVCBP and pSVCIITA ( Fig .
2B ) .
Cellular lysates were incubated with an anti-CPB antibody and then examined for the presence of CIHITA in these immunoprecipitates by Western blotting .
Only when both CBP and CIITA were coexpressed was CIITA detected in our CBP complexes ( Fig .
2B , lane 2 ) .
We conclude that CBP increases the transcription of class II genes by interacting with CHITA .
CIITA binds to a specific domain of CBP in vitro .
Previous studies have produced a long list of transcription factors that interact directly with one of the four domains of CBP ( 22 ) .
These sequences contain amino acids from positions 1 to 101 , 461 to 661 , 1621 to 1891 , and 2058 and 2163 in CBP ( Fig .
3A ) ( 22 ) .
To determine if CIITA bound specifically to CBP , we created fusion proteins between these four domains of CBP and GST .
These chimeras were used in a binding assay with CIITA , which was transcribed and translated with onine in vitro .
Hybrid GST-CBP proteins , along with any bound CIITA , were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography .
One-tenth of the CIHITA protein used for the binding reactions is presented in Fig .
3B , lane 1 .
When CIITA was combined with glutathione-Sepharose beads , alone ( Fig .
3B , lane 2 ) or complexed with GST ( lane 3 ) , essentially no CIITA bound to our beads .
Similarly , CIITA did not bind to GST-CBP ( 1-101 ) ( lane 4 ) , GST-CBP ( 461-661 ) ( lane 5 ) , or GST-CBP ( 2058-2163 ) ( lane 7 ) .
However , CIITA bound efficiently to GST-CBP ( 1621-1891 ) ( lane 6 ) .

( B ) In vitro binding assays were carried out with the transcribed and translated CIITA and GST-CBP fusion proteins containing amino acids from positions 1 to 101 ( lane 4 ) , 461 to 661 ( lane 5 ) , 1621 to 1891 ( lane 6 ) , and 2058 to 2163 ( lane 7 ) .
Glutathione-Sepharose beads ( lane 2 ) and GST alone ( lane 3 ) did not bind to CIITA .
Lane 1 contains 10 % of the input CIITA protein .
( C ) Coomassie blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel demonstrating that equivalent amounts of GST-CBP fusion proteins were included in the binding reactions .
of the autoradiographed gel with the Coomassie blue dye , amounts of GST and GST-CBP fusion proteins were equivalent in these binding reactions ( Fig .
3C ) .
Thus , CIITA binds to specific sequences of CBP which are found in the C-terminal part of the HAT domain .
This region was previously demonstrated to bind c-Fos ( 8 ) , TFIIB ( 27 ) , E1A ( 4 , 32 ) , RSK1 ( 35 ) , and MyoD ( 44 ) ( Fig .
3A ) .
The N-terminal activation domain of CIITA binds to CBP .
Next , we wanted to determine which domain of CIITA was required for these interactions with CBP .
The N-terminal 143 amino acids of CIITA have been identified as an independent transcriptional activation domain ( Fig .
4A ) ( 43 , 55 ) .
This region is rich in acidic amino acids and also interacts with TAFp32 ( 18 ) .
To map the interaction between CBP and CIITA , two partial CIITA proteins , one spanning the activation domain from positions 1 to 143 [ CIITA ( 1-143 ) ] and the other containing amino acids from positions 144 to 1103 of [ CHTA ( 143-1103 ) ] , were transcribed and translated in vitro ( Fig .
4A ) .
These two truncated CIITA proteins were allowed to interact with GST-CBP ( 1621-1891 ) .
As previously demonstrated , the full-length CIITA bound to GST-CBP ( 1621-1891 ) ( Fig .
4B , lane 1 ) .
However , CHTA ( 143-1103 ) , which lacks the N-terminal activation domain and is unable to transactivate class II genes , did not bind significantly to GST-CBP ( 1621-1891 ) ( lane 2 ) .
In sharp contrast , CIHITA ( 1-143 ) , which contains the transcriptional activation domain of CIITA , bound to GST-CBP ( 1621-1891 ) ( lane 3 ) .

strated in Fig .
4C , equal amounts of these CIITA proteins were included in our binding reactions .
We conclude that CBP interacts with CIITA via its N-terminal transcriptional activation domain .
DN-CBP inhibits the transcriptional synergy between CIITA and CBP .
To characterize further transcriptional synergy between CIITA and CBP , we created a dominant negative form of CBP that should inhibit the function of the wild-type protein .
Two dominant negative forms of p300 , a factor that is highly related to CBP , have been identified ( 6 ) .
We transposed the amino acid coordinates of one of these dominant negative p300 proteins onto the sequence of CBP to create DN-CBP , containing amino acids from positions 1903 to 2441 in CBP .
A plasmid effector was constructed to express DN-CBP under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter ( pCRDN-CBP ) .
pSVCIITA and pCMVCBP were cotransfected with pDRASCAT into 293T cells , resulting in 22-fold-increased CAT enzymatic activity over baseline levels ( Fig .
5 , column 3 ) .
Including pCRDN-CBP in a similar cotransfection transactivated pDRASCAT only sixfold ( column 4 ) , indicating that DN-CBP inhibited the function of its wild-type counterpart .
DN-CBP also had a smaller but reproducible effect on the ability of CIITA to activate the DRA promoter in the absence of exogenous CBP .
In this instance , the cotransfection of pSVCIITA and pCRDN-CBP transactivated pDRASCAT only threefold ( column 5 ) .
Cotransfecting pCRDN-CBP with pDRASCAT has no effect on the already low baseline levels of expression form the DRA promoter ( column 6 ) .
Thus , not only does CBP promote the transcription of class II genes , but DN-CBP can block this effect .

DN-CBP inhibits the transcriptional synergy between CIITA and CBP .
pDRASCAT was coexpressed with CIITA individually and in combination with CBP in 293T cells .
In addition , DN-CBP , which contains amino acids from positions 1903 to 2441 in CBP , was coexpressed in these cells Amounts of cotransfected plasmids were kept constant ( 0.5 ug of pDRASCAT and pCRDN-DBP ; 0.25 pg of pCMVCBP and pSVCIITA ; empty plasmid vector was included to maintain the total amount of transfected plasmid at 2.0 pg ) .
pDRASCAT was coexpressed with empty plasmid vector ( white bar ) , CIITA ( gray bar ) , CIITA and CBP ( black bar ) , CIITA , CBP , and DN-CIITA ( cross-hatched bar ) , CIITA and DN-CBP ( small-squares bar ) , or DN-CBP ( striped bar ) .
Fold transactivation ( TA ) was calculated from the bar graph and represents values of top bars over the value obtained with pDRASCAT alone .
CAT activities represent mean values of three different experiments performed in triplicate with indicated standard errors of the mean .
DN-CBP reduces the expression of class II determinants on the surface of B-lymphoblastoid cells .
To determine if CBP played a similar role in the transcription of class II genes in B cells , where these genes and CIITA are expressed at high levels , we coexpressed DN-CBP and CIITA in human B-lymphoblastoid RM3 cells ( 33 ) .
RM3 cells are mutant Raji cells , where CIITA is no longer functional .
However , the introduction of CIITA into these cells leads to the expression of class II determinants at levels observed in parental Raji cells .
RM3 cells were chosen because they synchronized the expression of DN-CBP and CIITA proteins and avoided the issues of preexisting high levels and slow turnover of class II determinants in wild-type B-lymphoblastoid cells .
Identical results were also obtained with Raji cells , which expressed DN-CBP constitu-tively ( data not presented ) .
Forty-eight hours after cotransfec-tion , RM3 cells were stained for class II and class I determinants ( Fig .
6 ) .
As the green fluorescence protein was coexpressed in these cells , only 10 % of the brightest cells were analyzed by FACS .
The expression of CIITA alone led to very high levels of expression of class II determinants ( Fig .
6A , dark gray peak ) .
At a ration of 3 to 1 , DN-CBP protein led to a 60 % reduction in levels of class II determinants ( HLA-DP ) on these cells ( Fig .
6A , black peak ) .
In sharp contrast , no reduction in levels of class I determinants was observed with DN-CBP in these cells ( Fig .
6B , black peak ) .
These data indicate that CBP plays a role in the expression of class II genes in B cells where their transcription is high and constitutive .
Increased expression of CBP can reverse the inhibition of class II transcription by the glucocorticoid hormone .
Next , we wanted to determine if CBP had a role in the inhibition of class II transcription by the glucocorticoid hormone .
Previous studies demonstrated that dexamethasone ( 9 , 47 ) and ursodeoxycholic acid ( 51 ) can inhibit the transcription of class II genes and that this inhibition requires the translocation of GR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus .
Similarly , glucocorticoid hor- Vor .

RM3 cells were transfected with the pSVCIITA ( 5 and 15 pg of empty plasmid vector ) ( dark gray peaks ) , with pSVCIITA ( 5 mg ) and pCRDN-CBP ( 15 pg ) ( black peaks ) , or with the empty plasmid vector ( 20 ug ) ( light gray peaks ) .
Cells were incubated with the anti-HLA-DP ( MHC II ) or anti-HLA-A , -B , and -C ( MHC I ) antibodies and subsequently visualized with a phycocrythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse antibody .

mone can inhibit the ability of AP-1 to activate the transcription of promoters containing an AP-1 binding site ( 23 , 31 , 46 , 54 ) .
Kamei et al .
( 24 ) demonstrated that one mechanism by which the inhibition of AP-1 might occur is by the squelching of a limited amount of CBP by the ligand-bound GR in the nucleus ( 5 ) .
Since we determined that CBP plays an important role in the expression of class II genes , we wanted to test if a similar mechanism of squelching was responsible for the inhibition of class II transcription by the glucocorticoid hormone .
pSVCIITA was transfected into 293T cells , which transactivated pDRASCAT 41-fold ( Fig .
7 , column 2 ) .
When these cells were subsequently treated with 1 M dexamethasone , transcriptional activation fell sevenfold to sixfold over baseline levels , even though identical amounts of pSVCIITA and pDRASCAT were used in these transfections ( column 3 ) .
However , when pCMVCBP was cotransfected with pSVCIHITA and pDRASCAT , this inhibition by dexamethasone was reversed in a dose-dependent fashion ( columns 4 and 5 , respec-tively ) .
With higher amounts of pCMVCBP , levels of expression increased 32-fold despite the presence of dexamethasone , approaching those observed in the absence of dexamethasone ( compare columns 2 and 5 ) .
We conclude that this glucocorticoid hormone inhibits the transcription of class II genes by ROLE OF CTB IN CLASS II GENE TRANSCRIPTION - 945 1 41 8 20 32 Fold TA 1000 800 600 400 200 0 CHTA CBP DEX 10 2 3 4 5 FIG .

Increasing amounts of CBP relieve the inhibition of class II transcription by dexamethasone .
pDRASCAT was coexpressed with CIITA , and transfected cells were treated with 1 wM dexamethasone ( DEX ; striped bar ) or dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle ( gray bar ) .
Increasing amounts of CBP were coexpressed in these cells ( 0.25 and 0.5 g of pCMVCBP ; black bars ) .
Amounts of cotransfected plasmids were kept constant ( 0.5 g of pDRASCAT and 0.75 of pSVCIITA ; 0.25 pg and 0.5 pg of pCMVCBP ; empty plasmid vector was included to maintain the total amount of transfected plasmid at 2.0 pg ) .
pDRASCAT was coexpressed with empty plasmid vector ( white bar ) , CIITA ( gray bar ) , CIITA and dexamethasone ( striped bar ) , or CIITA and different amounts of CBP ( 0.25 and 0.5 mg ) in the presence of dexamethasone ( black bar ) .
Fold transactivation ( TA ) was calculated from the bar graph and represents values of top bars over the value obtained with pDRASCAT alone .
CAT activities represent mean values of three independent experiments performed in triplicate with indicated standard errors of the mean .
causing the GR to translocate to the nucleus and compete with CIITA for a limited amount of CBP .
DISCUSSION CIITA is the key regulatory protein for the transcription of class II genes ( 48-50 ) .
In this study , we identified CBP as an additional coactivator .
CBP and CIITA not only synergized in the transcription from the DRA promoter but physically interacted with each other .
CIITA bound to CBP at residues from positions 1621 to 1891 , where CBP also interacts with c-Fos ( 8 ) , TFIIB ( 27 ) , E1A ( 4 , 32 ) , RSK1 ( 35 ) , and MyoD ( 44 ) ( Fig .
3A ) .
Additionally , the binding of CBP to CIITA occurred via the N-terminal activation domain of CIITA .
DN-CBP specifically inhibited the transcriptional synergy between CBP and CIITA and reduced the expression of class II genes on the surface of B-lymphoblastoid cells .
Our study also provides a mechanistic insight into the inhibition of class II transcription by the glucocorticoid hormone .
Not only did dexamethasone inhibit the transcription of class II genes , but the overexpression of CBP was able to reverse this effect .
It was reported previously that the treatment of cells with dexamethasone inhibited the transcription of class II genes ( 9 , 47 ) .
This inhibition required the translocation of GR to the nucleus ( 47 ) .
In vitro protein-DNA binding assays suggested that GR might be able to inhibit the binding of an unidentified complex to the X1 box of the DRB1 promoter ( 9 ) .
However , using an in vivo binding assay ( 16 ) , we found that dexamethasone treatment had little , if any , effect on the interaction of RFX with the X box ( data not presented ) .
Moreover , Kamei et al .
demonstrated that the inhibition of AP-1 by dexamethasone was due to the squelching of a limited amount of CBP by GR in the nucleus ( 24 ) .
In these studies , the overexpression of CBP resulted in the reversal of the inhibition by dexamethasone of transcription which depended on a tetradecanoyl phorbol ac-etate-responsive element .

Diagrammatic representation of how dexamethasone inhibits the transcription of class II genes .
( A ) In the absence of dexamethasone , CBP binds to CHITA .
In turn , CIITA is attracted to class II promoters via RFX , which binds to the X box .
( B ) The administration of dexamethasone results in the translocation of the GR to the nucleus , where it binds to CBP .
In this manner , GR sequesters a limited amount of CBP in the nucleus , leaving little to no free CBP to interact with CIITA on class II promoters .
GRE , glucocortoid response element .
androgen receptor are also due to the competition for limiting amounts of CBP ( 1 ) .
Similarly , we determined that the decreased transcription of class II genes following the administration of dexamethasone could be reversed by the overexpression of CBP .
We conclude that the primary mechanism for the inhibition of class II transcription by the glucocorticoid hormone is the squelching of a limited amount of CBP , not the blocking of proteins that interact with the X box .
This mechanism is presented diagrammatically in Fig .
8 .
Direct interactions between CIITA and CBP were mapped to the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of CIITA .
This domain is rich in acidic amino acids .
Mutageneses of this region identified two putative « helices which are required not only for transcriptional activation but also for the binding of CIITA to TAF , ,32 ( 18 ) .
The interaction of CBP with CREB occurs via the so-called KIX domain , in which serine 133 of CREB is phosphorylated ( 13 , 27 , 39 ) .
In addition , CREB has a glutamine-rich activation domain which also interacts with human TAF , ,130 ( 37 ) .
It appears that CIITA may also function in a similar manner , not only contacting a component of TFIID but also recruiting CBP and its associate HAT activity .
Although experiments have not ruled out the formation of a tripartite complex composed of TAF ; ,32 , CBP and CIITA , it seems unlikely that this would occur due to steric consider-ations .
Rather , CIITA probably interacts with these two complexes at different times in the transcription cycle .
CIITA could initiate transcription via its interactions with TFIID and subsequently promote chromatin remodeling by recruiting CBP .
CBP is the second coactivator which has been identified as a binding partner for CIHITA , which is itself a transcriptional coactivator .
The B-cell-specific coactivator Bob-1 binds to CIITA and synergizes with it in the transcription of class II genes ( 17 ) .
Thus , the transcription of class II genes depends not only on the assembly of a complex protein-DNA structure but also on the formation of a multipartite coactivator network .
CIITA can therefore be viewed as a transcriptional integrator , coordinating the communication between sequence-specific DNA binding proteins with activities that promote transcriptional initiation and promoter clearance .
