We have localized a 317 base pair cis-acting regulatory element , HS I , associated with a hematopoietic-specific DNase I hypersensitive site , which lies approx .
3.7 kilobases upstream of the murine hematopoietic-specific GATA-1 IE promoter .
HS I directs high-level expression of reporter GATA-1/lacZ genes to primitive and definitive erythroid cells and megakaryocytes in transgenic mice .
Comparative sequence analysis of HS I between human and mouse shows approx .
63 % nucleotide identity with a more conserved core of 169 base pairs ( 86 % identity ) .
This core contains a GATA site separated by 10 base pairs from an E-box motif .
The composite motif binds a multi-protein hematopoietic-specific transcription factor complex which includes GATA-1 , SCL/tal-1 , E2A , Lmo2 and Ldb-1 .
Point mutations of the GATA site abolishes HS I function , whereas mutation of the E-box motif still allows reporter gene expression in both lineages .
Strict dependence of HS I activity on a GATA site implies that assembly of a protein complex containing a GATA-factor , presumably GATA-1 or GATA-2 , is critical to activating or maintaining its function .
Further dissection of the 317 base pair region demonstrates that , whereas all 317 base pairs are required for expression in megakaryocytes , only the 5 62 base pairs are needed for erythroid-specific reporter expression .
These findings demonstrate differential lineage requirements for expression within the HS I element .
Key words : GATA-1 , Cis-elements , Cell lineage , Transcriptional regulation , Hematopoiesis , Mouse INTRODUCTION The hematopoietic system presents a well-characterized model to investigate how multiple cell types arise from a common progenitor cell .
In vertebrates , hematopoiesis occurs in successive waves , each at different anatomical sites .
Primitive hematopoiesis , which takes place at E7.5-11.5 in the yolk sac blood islands of the mouse , produces embryonic ( or primitive ) erythroid cells .
These red cells remain nucleated and express embryonic-restricted globins .
At approx .
E11.5 hematopoiesis shifts to the fetal liver where definitive ( or adult ) erythrocytes and blood cells of other lineages , including megakaryocytes , are first produced .
In contrast to primitive erythrocytes , definitive red cells are enucleated and express adult globins .
In the perinatal period hematopoiesis shifts to the bone marrow , and the spleen in mice .
Cell fate decisions result in activation of lineage-specific patterns of gene expression .
Lineage-specific genes are regulated by a combination of ubiquitously expressed and lineage-restricted transcription factors .
In the mouse , gene targeting has established pivotal roles for several lineage-restricted factors in the expression of lineage-specific genes ( Shivdasani and Orkin , 1996 ) .
Thus , defining how lineage-restricted transcription factors are themselves regulated provides an instructive entry point to understanding how lineages are specified .
Among hematopoietic-restricted factors , GATA-1 has been most extensively studied .
GATA-1 , the founding member of the GATA family of transcription factors , recognizes a consensus target DNA sequence WGATAR found in promoters , enhancers , and locus control elements ( Weiss and Orkin , 1995 ) .
In hematopoietic cells , GATA-1 is expressed at low levels in multipotential progenitors ; expression is then restricted to erythroid cells , megakaryocytes , eosinophils and mast cells where it is abundantly expressed ( Mouthon et al. , 1993 ; Sposi et al. , 1992 ; Zon et al. , 1993 ) .
Genetic studies demonstrate that GATA-1 serves essential roles in erythroid and megakaryocytic precursor cell 2800 P. Vyas and others differentiation .
Loss of GATA-1 leads to erythroid maturation arrest ( Weiss et al. , 1994 ) and embryonic lethality in mice due to anemia ( Fujiwara et al. , 1996 ) .
High levels of GATA-1 are required for complete erythroid maturation , as erythroid cells expressing approx .
20 % of wild-type levels fail to mature ( McDevitt et al. , 1997b ) .
In mice harboring a targeted deletion of upstream regulatory sequences which selectively impairs GATA-1 expression in megakaryocytes , a role was established for GATA-1 in megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation .
How the GATA-1 gene is transcriptionally regulated is of particular interest .
One strategy to identify factors controlling GATA-1 expression is to characterize cis-acting elements that regulate its expression .
It is transcribed from two promoters , IT and IE ; IT is active predominantly in Sertoli cells , whereas IE is primarily utilized in hematopoietic cells ( Ito et al. , 1993 ) .
The IE promoter has maximal activity in erythroid cells in transient transfection assays and contains critical GATA and CACC motifs ( Hannon et al. , 1991 ; Schwartzbauer et al. , 1992 ; Tsai et al. , 1991 ) .
By itself , the promoter is not sufficient to confer high-level expression in transgenic mice ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ; Onodera et al. , 19972 ) .
Previously , we and others have identified an additional regulatory element , located upstream of the mouse GATA-/ gene ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ; Onodera et al. , 1997a ; Ronchi et al. , 1997 ) .
This element is associated with a hematopoietic-specific DNase I hypersensitive site , HS I ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ; Ronchi et al. , 1997 ) .
In transient transfection assays , HS I functions as an enhancer when linked to a minimal erythroid promoter ( Ronchi et al. , 1997 ; M. A. McD .
and S. H. O. , unpublished data ) .
In transgenic mice , DNA fragments encompassing HS I enhance the frequency of lines expressing either a GATA/lacZ or SV40 T-antigen reporter gene in primitive and definitive erythroid cells and megakaryocytes ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ; Onodera et al. , 1997a ; Ronchi et al. , 1997 ) .
Preliminary 5¢ deletions suggest that a 232 bp element approx .
3.9 kb upstream of the GATA-1 gene may be important for GATA-1 expression in primitive erythrocytes ( Onodera et al. , 19972 ) .
Additionally , reporter gene expression in definitive , but not primitive , cells depends on sequences within the first intron of the GATA-1 gene ( Onodera et al. , 1997a ) .
These experiments suggest that sequences upstream of the GATA-I gene are sufficient to activate GATA-1 expression in erythroid cells and megakaryocytes and additional intronic sequences are necessary for GATA-1 expression in definitive erythroid cells .
In contrast , deletion of an approx .
8 kb region including HS I reduces GATA-1 expression in megakaryocytes to approx .
5 % of wild-type , while leaving expression in erythroid cells unaffected ( Shivdasani et al. , 1997 ) .
Thus , although this upstream region is competent to direct reporter expression in both erythroid cells and megakaryocytes , it is necessary only for megakaryocyte-specific GATA-1 expression .
Presumably , in its absence additional regulatory elements in the GATA-I locus provide for expression in erythroid cells .
Here we describe a detailed functional analysis of HS I. Deletion analysis identified a 317 bp region sufficient to activate reporter gene expression in primitive and definitive erythroid cells and megakaryocytes .
HS I contains multiple potential consensus binding sites for regulatory factors including a composite GATA-E-box motif , an element that binds a multiprotein complex including GATA-1 , SCL/tal-1 , E2A , Lmo2 , and Ldb-1 ( Wadman et al. , 1997 ) .
By site-specific mutation we show that the GATA site is essential for activity of the element , whereas the E-box sequence is not .
Of particular note , however , we have demonstrated that the minimal sequences required for reporter gene expression in erythroid cells and megakaryocytes differ .

RESULTS DNase I hypersensitive site mapping upstream of the GATA-1 gene To identify cis-acting elements important for lineage-specific expression of GATA-1 , we performed a systematic search for DNase I hypersensitive sites .
Prior DNase I hypersensitive site mapping suggested one or more hematopoietic-specific sites lay upstream of the IE promoter .
However , their lineage- and developmental - stage-specificities had not been fully established ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ; Ronchi et al. , 1997 ) .
Therefore , we repeated DNase I analysis using a primitive erythroid cell line ( G4 ) ( Choi et al. , 1998 ) and a megakaryoblastic cell line ( L8507 ) which undergoes megakaryocytic differentiation on addition of thrombopoietin ( Tpo ) and the phorbol ester TPA ( Ishida et al. , 1993 ) .
For comparison , we used adult erythroid cells ( MEL ) and NIH3T3 cells , as positive and negative controls .
Nuclei were subjected to DNase I digestion and the extracted DNA further digested with Xbal .
Southern blots were hybridized with a probe containing the GATA-1 IT exon which labels the 5 end of a Xbal fragment ( Fig .
1A ) .
Three hematopoietic-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites located at coordinates 0 ( associated with the IE promoter , HS III ) , approx .
-2 kb ( HS II ) , and approx .
-3.7 kb ( HS I ) , with respect to the IE promoter were observed in MEL , G4 and L8507 nuclei .
An extra band is seen between HS II and HS I ( marked by an asterisk ) which was also present when genomic DNA was digested with Xbal and BamHI and Xbal and EcoRI , and therefore is unlikely to represent a hypersensitive site .
No hypersensitive sites were evident in NIH3T3 nuclei .
While sites were identified in the hematopoietic cell lines , no lineage- or developmental stage-specific differences were observed at this level of analysis .
Of the two DNase I sites upstream of the IE promoter , HS I was likely to be functionally important .
Prior data showed that genomic fragments containing either approx .
2.6 or approx .
2.7 kb of sequence upstream of the GATA-1 locus were unable to confer high-level reporter gene expression in hematopoietic cells whereas fragments containing either approx .
3.9 kb or approx .
7 kb of upstream sequences were active ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ; Onodera et al. , 1997a ) .
Therefore , the location of HS I was more accurately defined by fine DNase I mapping ( Fig .
1B ) .
Nuclei from MEL , G4 , L8507 and NIH3T3 cells were incubated with DNase I and the extracted DNA digested with EcoRI .
The Southern blot was hybridized with a labelled EcoRI-Bgll fragment which labels the 3 ' end of an EcoRI fragment .
HS I was accurately mapped with respect to an adjacent BamHI site , lying just proximal to it , as shown in Fig .
1B .
No lineage- or developmental stage-specific differences were identified in HS I fine structure .
Transcriptional regulation of GATA-1 2801 Phylogenetic sequence conservation of HS I Cross-species sequence comparisons assist in identifying candidate regulatory elements ( Gumucio et al. , 1992 ) .
We evaluated regions of sequence similarity between approx .
4.5 kb of upstream regions of the mouse and human GATA-/ genes .
Sequence comparison identified only two regions of significant homology ( Fig .
2A ) .
The first , an approx .
700 base-pair segment , corresponds to the IE promoter , previously identified to be 69.5 % identical between species ( Zon and Orkin , 1992 ) .
The second maps to an approx .
375 bp segment at HS I ( nucleotides 11 to 385 , Fig .
2B ) with approx .
71 % nucleotide identity between human and mouse .
The 5 '' end of homology begins near the BamHI site which was used to position HS I by DNase I mapping ( see above ) .
3 '' to the BamHI site a 169 bp region ( nucleotides 91 to 259 ) is approx .
86 % identical between species .
Multiple consensus transcription factor DNA-binding sites are contained within this region , including two CACC sites ( nucleotides 94 to 97 and 99 to 102 ) and a GATA site ( 157 to 154 ) separated by 10 bp from a conserved E-box motif ( 168 to 173 ) .
This composite GATA-E-box motif is similar to composite motifs shown in vitro to bind a multi-protein hematopoietic transcription factor complex ( see Introduction and below ) .
An imperfectly conserved palindromic sequence ( CTGTGGCCACAG ) is present at nucleotides 191-202 .
Further 3 ' , a highly conserved GC-rich area ( nucleotides 211-259 ) contains a potential ETS-binding site ( GGAA ) .
There are multiple dispersed fragments of conserved sequence at the 3 ' end of HS I including a striking block of homology between nucleotides 300-350 that does not contain known consensus transcription factor binding sites .
Of note , no sequence homology was observed at approx .
2 kb upstream of the IE promoter , which corresponds to the vicinity of HS II .
HS I directs high-level expression in erythroid and megakaryoctyic cells in transgenic mice In vivo function of HS I was tested in transient transgenic embryos .
DNA fragments containing 5¢ and 3 '' deletions of HS I were attached to a lacZ reporter construct , 5 ' 3'-lacZ ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ) where a lacZ reporter gene is embedded at the 'ATG ' of the GATA-1 gene ( Fig .
3 ) .
5 ' 3'-lacZ fails to direct high-level transgene expression in primitive and definitive erythroid cells ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ) Reporter gene expression was detected in primitive erythroid cells at E10.5 and in definitive erythroid cells and megakaryocytes in fetal liver at E14.5 from injected founders ( Go ) .
Fig .
2B illustrates the precise location of the ends of the constructs with respect to HS I sequence .
A summary of the findings from the first set of 5 and 3 ' deletion constructs and representative examples of X-gal staining are presented in Fig .
3 .
The 5 ' boundary of the element was established by examining constructs A , B and C. Construct A , containing the largest portion of HS I , extends downstream from nucleotide 106 .
While it does not include CACC sites at nucleotides 94-102 , it retains the remainder of the conserved segments of HS I ( Fig .
2B ) .
Construct A directs high-level B-gal expression in approx .
50 % of transgenic embryos ; 60-100 % of primitive erythroid cells , 4-56 % of definitive erythroid cells and 3-48 % of megakaryocytes stained strongly with negligible ectopic staining ( Fig .
3A ) .
In contrast , constructs B and C , which extend from positions 222 and 405 , respectively , were inactive ( Fig .
3B , C ) with < 0.5 % of either erythroid or megakaryocytic cells staining .

In contrast , a transgene harboring a mutated E-box motif ( construct H ) retained activity in primitive and definitive erythroid cells and megakaryocytes ( Fig .
4H ) .
X-gal staining alone does not exclude quantitative effects that might result from mutation of the E-box motif .
To rule out large differences in expression , quantitative analysis was performed , using o-nitrophenyl B-D-galactoside ( OPNG ) as substrate , on cell extracts from circulating definitive erythrocytes .
Three transgenic lines harbouring construct H and a control line containing a construct with approx .
7 kb of sequence upstream of the IE promoter attached to a GATA/lacZ reporter gene ( UHR 5 ' 3'-lacZ , Line 133 ) were analyzed .
This previously described line expresses B-gal at high levels in red cells and megakaryocytes ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ) .
Analyses showed no significant difference in levels of B-gal expression between lines containing construct H or UHR 5 ' 3'-lacZ ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , at least within definitive erythrocytes , the conserved E-box sequence does not appear to exert a large quantitative influence on HS I 's ability to direct transgene expression .
In marked contrast , however , an intact GATA-1 site is required .
Protein-DNA interactions at the GATA-E-Box composite motif in HS I Wadman et al .
( 1997 ) described a multi-protein complex from erythroid cell nuclear extracts that assembles in vitro on a composite GATA-E-box element , similar to that in HS I .
In that binding of the putative complex to an authentic regulatory element has not been correlated with in vivo gene expression , we sought to determine whether a multi-protein complex containing GATA-1 , SCL/tal-1 , Lmo2 , E2A , and Ldb1l could 2804 P.

This finding was confirmed by supershift experiments ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig .

To confirm that disruption of large complexes by these multiple antibodies was specific , supershifts performed with antibodies directed to Spl and NF-1 failed to disrupt the complexes ( Fig .

Therefore , we conclude that the GATA-E-box motif in HS I is competent , in vitro , to bind GATA-1 , as well as a multiprotein complex containing ( at a minimum ) GATA-1 , SCL /tal-1 , EZA , Lmo2 and Ldb-1 .
No differences in the components of this complex were observed between different nuclear extracts .
Given functional dependence of HS I on an intact GATA-site , we assessed whether this site , in the context of the composite motif , could play a dominant role in assembly of the 2806 P.

Nuclear extracts from L8057 cells treated with Tpo and TPA ( L8057 T/T ) were incubated with probe containing GATA-E-box motif in HS I .
No antiserum or Protein A was added to reacton in lane 1 .
Preimmune antiserum was added to reaction in lane 2 .

multi-protein complex .
To test this hypothesis , increasing amounts of different unlabelled oligonucleotide competitors were added , in EMSA , to MEL cell nuclear extract and labelled HS I composite site probe .
Competitor oligonucleotides included wild-type HS I composite motif ( lanes 2-6 ) , HS I composite motif with a mutation in the GATA site ( lanes 8-12 ) , and a HS I composite motif with a mutation in the E-box site ( lanes 13-17 ) .
The GATA and E-box mutations were identical to those tested in transgenic mice .
A 10-fold excess of wild-type HS I composite site competitor quantitatively competes binding of the high molecular mass complex to labelled HS I probe .
Similarly , a 10- to 25-fold excess of competitor containing an intact GATA site but a mutant E-Box motif efficiently disrupts binding of the multi-protein complex to probe .
In contrast , competition with competitor containing a mutant GATA site but intact E-box motif competes poorly .
Next we tested whether mutations in the GATA and E-Box sites that were studied functionally affect in vitro binding of the multi-protein complex to DNA ( Fig .
6B ) .
Nuclear extracts from MEL and L8057 cells were incubated with three different labelled composite site probes ; one contained wild-type GATA and E-box sites ( lanes 1-4 ) and the other two contained substitutions in the E-box ( lanes 5-8 ) or GATA site ( lanes 9-12 ) .
As shown in Fig .
6B , binding of the multi-protein complex to DNA is dependent on the integrity of both sites .
Similar results were obtained with nuclear extract from G4 cells ( data not shown ) .
Taken together with the competition experiments outlined above , our data indicate that in vitro assembly of the multi-protein complex requires intact GATA and E-box sequences .
However , binding of a GATA factor is the primary determinant of stability of the complex on DNA .
The 3 ' end of HS I is required for megakaryocytic and is dispensable for erythroid-specific expression To further localize the minimal sequences needed for high-level reporter gene expression in red cells and megakaryocytes , two constructs A-E and A-F containing 3 ' deletions of the construct A-D were tested in transient transgenic embryos .
Construct A-E , which begins at nucleotide 106 and terminates at 238 ( Fig .
2B ) and removes 184 bp from the 3 ' end of construct A-D , exhibited strong activity in erythroid cells ; 1 % -100 % of primitive and 4 % -84 % of definitive erythroid cells showed staining ( Fig .
7A-E ) .
However , expression in megakaryocytes was not evident ( Fig .
7A-E ) .
The difference in X-gal staining in megakaryocytes seen with constructs A-D and A-E suggests that sequences in the 3 ' 184 bp of HS I are expression - in required for high-level reporter gene megakaryocytes .
This conclusion is further substantiated by construct A-F ( nucleotides 106-167 ) which is active in erythroid cells , but inactive in megakaryocytes ( Fig .
7A-F ) .
One potential reason for failure of X-gal staining in megakaryocytes with constructs A-E and A-F could be technical ; variegated B-gal expression , especially inappropriate age-dependent silencing , has been reported ( Robertson et al. , 1996 , 1995 ) .
However , this is unlikely for three reasons .
First , strong B-gal expression is seen in megakaryocytes with constructs A , A-D and G implying that variegated expression does not occur in megakaryocytes per se .
Second , loss of - megakaryocyte - expression correlates with loss of conserved sequences from reporter constructs .
Third , unlike previous reports , analysis presented here was performed in embryos and not older animals .
Therefore , we feel these observations are likely to be valid and delimit sequences necessary for transgene expression in erythroid cells to 62 bp at the 5° end of HS I , and identify a requirement for additional 3 ' sequences in megakaryocytes .
DISCUSSION Our aim has been to define how lineage-specific expression of the GATA-1 gene is achieved .
Previous work identified an upstream region ( HS 1 ) hypersensitive to DNase I digestion in erythroid cell chromatin ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ; Ronchi et al. , 1997 ) .
Although this region does not confer copy-number-dependent _ and __ position-independent expression on transgenes in mice , properties of locus control regions , it is potent at directing high-level reporter gene expression to erythroid and megakaryocytic cells ( McDevitt et al. , 19972 ; Onodera et al. , 1997a ; Ronchi et al. , 1997 ) .
Moreover , we have recently rescued the GATA-1-null phenotype in mice by breeding a GATA-1 hetrozygote female to a low-copy number transgenic mouse with a GATA-1 transgene expressed under the control of a DNA fragment containing HS I ( Y. F. and S. O. , unpublished results ) .
These results establish that HS I contains cis-acting sequences competent to drive high-level , lineage-specific expression of GATA-1 .
Here we describe a detailed functional analysis of HS I .
To precisely localize the region of interest , we performed higher resolution DNase I hypersensitive site mapping over an approx .
10 kb segment of DNA upstream of the GATA-1 gene .
Three hematopoietic-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites were identified : HS I , approx .
3.6 kb upstream of the IE promoter ; HS II approx .
2.0 kb upstream ; and HS III which is associated with the IE promoter .
These results confirm and refine prior DNase I mapping Transcriptional regulation of GATA-1 2807 ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ; Ronchi et al. , 1997 ) .
Compared to Ronchi et al .
( 1997 ) , we find an additional hematopoietic-specific DNase I site ( HS II ) .

Lying within this core are conserved GATA and E-box motifs spaced and oriented in such a fashion as to bind a multi-protein complex of hematopoietic nuclear factors in vitro .
By mutational analysis we demonstrated that the GATA site is essential for HS I activity , whereas the E-box motif is not strictly required .

element demonstrated that the 5 62 bps are sufficient to permit expression in primitive and definitive erythroid cells .
Additional sequences lying downstream are required for megakaryocyte-specific expression in vivo .
Role of composite GATA-E-box elements The composite GATA-E-Box element in HS I conforms to a consensus complex sequence upon which multiple nuclear proteins present in erythroid cell nuclear extracts assemble in vitro ( Wadman et al. , 1997 ) .
These include GATA-1 and SCL/tal-1 , as well as E2A , Lmo2 and Ldb1l .
Of these , GATA-1 , SCL/tal-1 and Lmo2 are highly hematopoietic-restricted .
The relevance of the composite DNA element and the multiprotein complex capable of assembling on it in vitro has yet to be fully defined by in vivo studies .
Investigating the relationship of the element to regulation of the GATA-1 gene is of particular interest in two respects .
First , as gene targeting experiments demonstrate an essential role for both SCL/tal-1 and Lmo2 at the hematopoietic stem cell level ( Robb et al. , 1995 ; Shivdasani et al. , 1995 ; Warren et al. , 1994 ) , these factors are candidate regulators of GATA-1 gene transcription .
Second , as GATA-2 also appears to act upstream of GATA-1 , at least temporally within hematopoietic progenitors , GATA-2 might contribute to transcriptional control of GATA-1 through HS I .
To assess the relevance of the composite element , therefore , we sought to correlate in vivo activity of HS I and its modified versions with in vitro nuclear protein binding in gel shift analyses .
Remarkably , mutation of the HS I conserved GATA site within the context of the entire transgene construct ablated reporter expression .
Additionally , this mutation prevented assembly of the multi-protein GATA-1-containing complex on the composite element .
Thus , we conclude that binding of GATA-1 , or another GATA-factor ( e.g .
GATA-2 ) , is essential to activity of HS I .
From this , we infer that a GATA-factor orchestrates assembly of the protein complex .
In part , this may be achieved through protein-protein interactions of GATA-factors with other factors , largely mediated through contacts in the zinc-finger DNA-binding domain .
In contrast , mutation of the E-box sequence within the composite motif did not ostensibly interfere with transgene expression , though formation of the multi-protein complex was abrogated .
Although this might be taken to indicate that E-box binding factors , such as SCL/tal-1 , are not active at this element in vivo , this view may be incorrect on several grounds .
First , mutation of the E-box site may have a quantitative effect on transgene expression that has eluded detection in our experiments .
Quantitative B-gal analysis performed on circulating definitive erythrocytes from three construct H transgenic lines expressing B-gal and a control line with approx .
7 kb of upstream sequence failed to reveal significant differences in expression of B-galactosidase per lacZ-positive red cell between these two constructs .
Given position effects and a several-fold range in expression per cell in controls ( McDevitt et al. , 19972 ) , we can not exclude small quantitative effects of the E-box site mutation on expression in definitive erythroid cells .
This analysis also still leaves open possible effects on expression in primitive erythroid cells or megakaryocytes , which can not be evaluated by current methods .
Second , it is often inappropriate to extrapolate directly from in vitro protein binding to DNA in gel shift assays to binding events in chromatin templates in vivo .
Namely , in erythroid chromatin the GATA site within the composite motif might be the principal or sole determinant of DNA binding by the multi-protein complex .
This possibility is suggested by the competition experiments ( Fig .
6A ) that implicate the GATA-site in stability of the complex .
Furthermore , as discussed below , a complex containing GATA-3 , SCL/tal-1 and Lmo2 has been reported to bind a GATA site alone .
Third , the multiprotein complex may be required to initiate , but not maintain , GATA-1 gene expression .
Expression of a randomly integrated transgene might not mimic mechanisms operative in activation of the HS I element during normal development .
Subsequent to the original report of the composite GATA-E-box element , three genes have been described containing such sequences .
As yet , the relevance of these sequences to gene transcription has not been adequately addressed .
Transcriptional regulation of GATA-1 2809 Upstream of the erythroid-specific EKLF gene , a GATA-E-box-GATA motif has been identified ( Anderson et al. , 1998 ) .
Mutation of any of the individual transcription factor DNA-binding sites severely compromised the activity of this unit in stably transfected erythroid cells We observed that this element binds a protein complex containing GATA-1 , SCL /tal-1 , EZA , Lmo2 , Ldb-1 .
Furthermore , the integrity of all three sites within it are required for protein complex assembly ( P. V. and S. H. O. , unpublished data ) .
On the other hand , Ono et al .
( 1998 ) have recently reported that an E-box sequence upstream of the Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene is not required for transcriptional activation from a GATA-E-box element in T-lymphoid cells ( Ono et al. , 1998 ) .
The authors suggest that a complex including GATA-3 , SCL/Tal-1 and Lmo2 assembles anchored to DNA through the GATA site alone .
The composite motif in this gene may be functionally different , however , in that the GATA and E-box sites are widely spaced .
Lastly , an E-box-Ebox-GATA element capable of binding a multi-protein complex has been identified in a putative SCL/tal-1 target gene identified through chromatin - immunoselection - ( Cohen-Kaminsky et al. , 1998 ) .
Here , reporter assays in transient transfection experiments suggested that the individual E-box sites might contribute either positively or negatively to activity of the element .
Further studies are therefore needed in order to assess the biological relevance of composite GATA-E-box sequences in transcriptional control in vivo .
Several variations on the initial consensus element are already apparent .
It seems likely that differences in sequences of these elements confer different transcriptional effects depending on developmental context .
The discordance we note in our studies between transgene expression and in vitro DNA-protein binding may underestimate the true contribution of the composite element in vivo .
This conservative interpretation is in accord with the extraordinary conservation of the HS I composite motif between mouse and human .
Critical role of GATA factor binding Remarkably only the 5° 62 bp of HS I are required for high-level transgene expression in erythroid cells .
Only a conserved GATA site is evident within these sequences .
By mutational analysis this site is essential for in vivo activity of HS I .
This finding is consistent with in vitro and in vivo footprinting of the GATA site in erythroid extracts or cells ( Ronchi et al. , 1997 ; P. V. , S. G. K. and S. H. O. , unpublished ) , and the requirement of this GATA site for enhancer activity in transiently transfected erythroid cells ( Ronchi et al. , 1997 ; M. A. McD .
and S. H. O. , unpublished ) .
As sequences flanking the GATA site are also conserved between human and mouse , other , as yet unidentified , transcription factors may bind this region and in some fashion select this specific GATA-site for functional importance , perhaps by potentiating GATA factor binding to DNA .
The critical role of this upstream GATA site lends additional weight to prior studies demonstrating the potential importance of GATA binding sites in GATA-1 gene regulation .
For example , within the IT promoter , located approx .
8.3 kb upstream of the IE promoter , several functional GATA sites have been described ( Onodera et al. , 1997b ) .
Though the IT promoter may be principally active in Sertoli cells , it is also active in hematopoietic stem cells ( Migliaccio et al. , 1996 ) .
In 2810 P. Vyas and others addition , the IE promoter contains palindromic GATA sites that may contribute to positive autoregulation ( Schwartzbauer et al. , 1992 ; Tsai et al. , 1991 ) .
What might the biological significance of a critical GATA-site within the HS I element be ?
If transcription of the GATA-1 gene is activated through the HS I region , GATA-2 might first bind , either alone or within a larger complex , to the conserved GATA-site .
Our prior observation that the a large GATA-I gene based-lacZ reporter gene is active in GATA-1~ primitive erythroid cells is consistent with this possibility ( McDevitt et al. , 1997a ) , as is our finding that GATA-2 binds the GATA site in HS I alone and in a multi-protein complex ( P. V. and S. H. O. , unpublished results ) .
These observations could be interpreted to suggest that GATA-2 may play an important role in the initiation of GATA-I gene expression .
If correct , its role may not be obligatory as GATA-1 is expressed in GATA-2~7-hematopoietic cells ( Tsai et al. , 1994 ) .
Either additional GATA-factors , such as GATA-3 , contribute to GATA-1 gene activation , or other cis-elements not dependent on GATA-2 for their activity are present in the locus .
Upon gene activation and initial accumulation of GATA-1 protein , GATA-1 probably participates in maintenance of its expression in an autoregulatory loop .
Such positive feedback control may permit progressive increase in GATA-1 expression as erythroid cells mature ( Schwartzbauer et al. , 1992 ; Trainor et al. , 1996 ; Tsai et al. , 1991 ) .
Different sequence requirements for expression in erythroid and megakaryocytic cells Though erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages share several transcription factors , such as GATA-1 , FOG-1 , NF-E2 , and SCL/tal-1 ( Andrews et al. , 1993 ; Martin et al. , 1990 ; Mouthon et al. , 1993 ; Romeo et al. , 1990 ) additional components must discriminate their transcriptional programs .
The nature of these are unknown .
In this context , therefore , our demonstration that 3 ' sequences of HS I are required to direct megakaryocyte expression but are dispensable for erythroid expression is unanticipated and of particular interest .
One possibility is that these additional sequences interact with nuclear factors necessary to prevent shut-off of the gene in maturing megakaryocytes .
The nature of the critical protein-DNA interactions within the 3 ' 184 bp of HS I is unknown .
Cross-species sequence comparison reveals three broad regions of homology ( 230-259 which is contained within a larger area of homology , 288-351 , and 358-85 ; Fig .
2B ) .
The first of these is a GC-rich region which binds various proteins in vitro , including Spl as well as other unidentified proteins ( Ronchi et al. , 1997 ) , ( S. G. K. , P. V. and S. H. O. , unpublished results ) .
A consensus ets-binding site ( GGAA , nucleotides 242-245 ) lies within this homology .
Previous cis-acting element analysis of megakaryocyte specific genes has suggested that GATA and ets-DNA binding sites may be important for conferring megakaryocyte specificity ( Lemarchandel et al. , 1993 ) .
Examination of the other two regions of sequence conservation does not reveal binding sites for known transcription factors .
To define sequences required for megakaryocyte-specific expression , we are currently examining additional deletion constructs of HS I .
Such studies may lead to the identification of novel megakaryocyte-specific nuclear factors or recognition of ubiquitous factors that cooperate with GATA-1 to direct expression in megakaryocytes .
