6 Specific NF- « B Subunits Act in Concert with Tat To Stimulate Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Transcription JINSONG LIU , NEIL D. PERKINS , ROLAND M. SCHMID , anp GARY J. NABEL* Departments of Internal Medicine and Biological Chemistry , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , University of Michigan Medical Center , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109-0650 Received 18 November 1991/Accepted 24 February 1992 NF-B is a protein complex which functions in concert with the fat-I gene product to stimulate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) transcription .
To determine whether specific members of the NF-B family contribute to this effect , we have examined the abilities of different NF-B subunits to act with Tat-I to stimulate transcription of HIV in Jurkat T-leukemia cells .
We have found that the p49 ( 100 ) DNA binding subunit , together with p65 , can act in concert with Tat-I to stimulate the expression of HIV-CAT plasmid .
Little effect was observed with 50-kDa forms of p105 NF-xB or rel , in combination with p65 or full-length c-re/ , which do not stimulate the HIV enhancer in these cells .
These findings suggest that the combination of p49 ( 100 ) and p65 NF- « B can act in concert with the tat-I gene product to stimulate the synthesis of HIV RNA .
Replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is stimulated in cell culture by activation of an infected cell with mitogens and specific cytokines ( 7 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 27 , 37 ) .
Induction of the HIV enhancer by mitogens and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 is mediated by the NF- « B transcription factor ( 7 , 9 , 12 , 23 , 24 , 27 ) .
NF- « B plays an important role in stimulation of HIV transcription after T-cell activation , and it is the target of several signal transduction pathways involving both cellular and viral proteins ( 24 ) .
Constitutively active in B cells and macrophages ( 12 , 35 , 36 ) , this transcription factor exists in an inactive form in the cytoplasm in other cell types ( 2-4 ) .
This complex is composed of at least three protein subunits : a DNA binding 48- to 55-kDa protein ( p50 ) ( 11 , 16 , 17 , 21 ) , an associated 65-kDa protein ( p65 ) which contains a transcriptional activation domain ( 2 , 3 , 25 , 31 ) and a third subunit , IxB , which binds to p65 and inhibits DNA binding ( 4 ) .
Phosphorylation of IB ( 10 ) causes dissociation from the DNA binding subunits which migrate into the nucleus where they bind to the kB elements in the HIV long terminal repeat , activating HIV transcription .
The p50 subunit was initially presumed to be the product of p105 NF-kB ( 11 , 17 , 21 ) , a rel-related protein .
Recently we have shown that another 50-kDa « B binding protein can also be derived from a related but distinct gene , p49 ( 100 ) .
In this case , a 50-kDa protein could be derived by proteolytic processing of the 100-kDa precursor or an alternative spliced form , which encodes a 49-kDa protein ( 32 ) .
We have shown that p49 or a truncated p100 can act with p65 to activate transcription from the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) in transient transfection assays ( 32 ) .
In addition , p49 associates with p65 in vitro to form a complex capable of binding the HIV « B element ( 29 ) .
In addition to NF- « B , the synthesis of HIV mRNA is stimulated by the product of the zat-I gene ( 1 , 30 ) , a virally encoded transactivator .
Tat is a protein that acts upon its target sequence ( TAR ) located immediately 3 ' of the transcriptional initiation site of HIV type 1 ( 8 , 22 , 26 ) .
Disruption of either the coding region for Tat or its binding site TAR severely reduces the level of transcription and virus produc- * Corresponding author .
3883 tion ( 14 ) .
However , production of virus containing mutations in TAR can be significantly increased by treatment with phorbol esters ( 14 ) , suggesting that NF- « B can function independently of Tat to stimulate HIV replication .
Previous studies have , however , suggested an interaction between cis-acting enhancer elements and far-I ( 5 , 24 , 38 ) .
Mutation of the kB sites resulted in a significant decrease of Tat-mediated transactivation ( 5 , 24 , 38 ) .
Efficient tar- ] transactivation has been observed in conjunction with the Spl sites of the enhancer ( 5 ) .
NF- « B can also compensate for Spl function in the replication of virus containing deletions in the Spl sites ( 28 ) .
These interactions are likely to be indirect , but demonstrated a functional interaction between NF-kB and the rat-I gene product .
We have therefore examined transcriptional activation of the HIV LTR by the different subunits of NF- « B in the presence or absence of Tat .
A reporter plasmid , HIV-CAT , containing the HIV LTR linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene ( 24 ) , was cotransfected into Jurkat T cells with eukaryotic expression vectors containing cDNAs for different NF- « B subunits under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus LTR ( 31 ) .
Transfection of the p49 ( 1 ug ) and p65 ( 1 ug ) expression vectors individually with HIV-CAT caused minimal increase in CAT activity , whereas the combination of p49 and p65 caused a 16-fold increase in the level of expression ( Fig .
1A ) ( 31 ) .
When a tat-I expression vector was cotransfected with HIV-CAT , an 80-fold increase was observed .
In contrast , a 388-fold activation was observed when both p49 and p65 expression plasmids were cotransfected with Tat .
The combined effects of these transactivators were therefore significantly more than additive .
In addition , the effects of the zat-I expression vector showed a dose response increase in CAT activity ( Fig .
1B ) .
At a low concentration of tat-I expression vector ( 0.2 ug ) , HIV-CAT activity increased 38-fold when cotransfected with p49/p65 expression vectors and increased to 760-fold with a higher concentration ( 5 ug ) of tat-I expression vector .
Both the kB binding site and the TAR sequence are required for this effect ( Fig .
2 ) .
In the absence of Tat , cotransfection of p49 and p65 failed to activate a mutant kB HIV reporter plasmid ( Fig .
2 ) , although it was induced 75-fold when cotransfected with the rat- expression vector .

Transactivation of HIV-CAT after cotransfection of p49 , p65 , and tat-I expression vectors .
( A ) Relative HIV-CAT activity after cotransfection with eukaryotic expression vectors for p49 , p65 , or both in the absence and presence of the zart-I expression vector .
Jurkat T cells were transfected with 10 ug of HIV-CAT plasmid and 1 mg of p49 and p65 Rous sarcoma virus expression vectors .
The construction of p49 and p65 eukaryotic expression vectors has been described previously ( 32 ) .
The rart-I expression vector contained a Sa/l-Xhol fragment ( nucleotide sequence 5785 to 8896 ) of BH1O0 inserted into the pLJ retrovirus vector ( 18 ) and was kindly provided by William Freimuth .
Tat expression vector ( 1 ug ) was included in all of the experiments unless specified otherwise .
The level of CAT activity in the absence of any inducer is normalized to 1 .
The numerical value of CAT activity , which is expressed as percent conversion of acetylated chloramphenicol per 10 ug of protein per h , is included in parentheses .
Appropriate dilution of proteins was made if the reaction was out of linear range .
Transfections and CAT assays were performed as previously described ( 29 ) .
( B ) Relative CAT activity after cotransfection with increasing amounts of the tar-l expression vector both in the absence and in the presence of 1 mg of p49 and p65 expression vectors .
No increase in CAT activity was detected from an HIV-CAT reporter plasmid with mutations in both the kB and TAR sequences in the presence of expression vectors for p49 and p65 , in the presence or absence of the tat-I gene product ( Fig .

Relative CAT activity obtained by using the HIV-CAT reporter plasmid with mutated « B sites ( mut « B ) or mutations in both kB and TAR sites ( mut < kB+TAR ) .
These reporter plasmids were cotransfected with expression vectors for p49 and p65 ( 1 ug of each ) in the absence or presence of Tat expression vector ( 1 ug ) .
The HIV-CAT plasmid with mutations in both kB and TAR sites was prepared by ligation of a Bg/lI fragment containing the kB mutations into equivalent sites in an HIV-CAT plasmid with a Sacl-HindlII deletion in TAR .
A plasmid ( 5 mg ) which contains four kB sites upstream of the simian virus 40 promoter is included as a TAR~ control ( 4xkB ) and has been previously described ( 20 ) .
Transfections were performed in the absence or presence of 1 ug of both p49 and p65 expression vectors as indicated .
The transfections and CAT assays were performed as described above .
+ - + - + - + - + TAR cis-regulatory sequences were required to mediate these effects .
To determine whether the product of the p105 gene could exert a stimulatory effect similar to that of ( p49 ( 100 ) NF- « B , the expression vectors for a truncated form of p105 and p65 were cotransfected with the HIV-CAT reporter either in the presence or in the absence of the far-I expression vector .
The truncated product of the p105 gene , alone or in combination with p65 ( Fig .
3A ) , as noted previously ( 32 ) , had little effect in the absence of Tat .
In addition , little activation was observed when these plasmids were cotransfected with the expression vector .
To determine whether the difference in transactivation of p49 and truncated p105 in the presence of Tat was due to the differential expression of these recombinant proteins , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed after these vectors were cotransfected with tat-I expression plasmid into Jurkat cells .
Both p49 and truncated p105 produced retarded bands of similar intensities ( Fig .
3B ) .
The identities of these transfected proteins have been confirmed further by using antibodies specific to each subunit ( 3la ) .
In addition , no « B binding activity is detected in the control-transfected Jurkat cells .
Both transfected NF- « kB bands were eliminated specifically by 10 ng of unlabeled B site but not by an unrelated octamer motif ( Fig .
3B ) .
These results suggest that the difference in transactivation is due to differences in protein function rather than to differential expression .
The truncated p105 expression vector is functional within Jurkat cells and displays the capacity to activate a « B element-containing reporter plasmid ( 29 ) , suggesting that this effect is specific for the HIV enhancer .
Similarly , when expression vectors for c-rel or its truncated form c-rel ( Apal ) were cotransfected with HIV-CAT , no stimulation was observed , and no further Vor .

Effect of truncated p105 NF- « B subunit in combination with p65 on HIV-CAT activity .
( A ) Relative CAT activity after cotransfection with the indicated expression vectors ( 1 pg ) , in the absence and presence of tar-I vector .
The expression vector for p105 is terminated at the Rsal site ( 32 ) .
Similar results have been observed with a truncation at the Xbal site , which generates a slightly longer gene product .
( B ) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of protein extracts prepared from Jurkat cells transfected with p49 and truncated p105 expression plasmids by using *°P-labeled H2 « B element-containing oligonucleotide ( 29 ) .
Nuclear protein extract ( 1 g ) was used for each binding assay .
All samples were cotransfected in the presence of 1 ug of Tat expression plasmid .
Nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis were performed as described previously ( 20 , 32 ) .
The specific bands containing p49-DNA or p50-DNA complexes are indicated by the arrows .
The endogenous NF-kB band found in nuclear protein extracts from phorbol myristate acetate-treated Jurkat cells is also indicated .
increase above the basal level of transcription was seen in the presence of the tar-I expression vector ( Fig .
4A ) , raising the possibility that p49 ( 100 ) in combination with p65 normally mediates this effect in these cells .
To test whether specific structural domains present in the p49/p65 complex are required for the enhanced level of transcription seen with Tat , we examined the level of HIV-CAT activity after cotransfection with plasmids which con NOTES 3885 A _ A -Tat +Tat 100 |- 0 033 ) ga. _ ( 12.5 ) § S I 50 |- § e \ S § ( 0.16 ) ( 0.14 ) ( 0.15 ) Control c-Rel cRel { Apa ! )

Ability of ftar-l to function with c-re/ , p105 , and their derivatives .
( A ) Relative CAT activity after cotransfection with full-length or Apal-truncated human c-re/ expression vectors together with p65 ( 1 mg ) either in the absence or in the presence of the tat-l expression vector .
Human c-re/ expression plasmids were a kind gift from Nancy Rice .
( B ) Relative CAT activity after cotransfection with p105-VP16 or re/-VP16 expression vector ( 1 ug ) either in the absence or in the presence of the expression vector .
The fusion plasmids p105-VP16 and re/-VP16 have been described previously ( 29 ) .
tain the DNA binding domain of p105 or c-re/ ( re/ [ ApalI ] ) fused to the herpes simplex virus VP16 acidic transcriptional activation domain ( 29 ) , termed p105-VP16 or re/-VP16 , respectively .
Each fusion protein strongly increased HIV-CAT activity ( Fig .
4B ) .
More importantly , each protein acted in concert with Tat to stimulate the expression of HIV , suggesting that the stimulation observed with Tat and p49/ p65 correlated with transcriptional activation of the enhancer rather than a direct interaction with structural domains of these NF-kB subunits .
The presence of multiple members of the NF- « kB-re/ family provides a means of regulating gene expression through different mechanisms .
Specific combinations of subunits could associate in response to different extracellular signals and recognize distinct « kB elements presented in different viral and cellular genes ( 29 ) .
Interaction between specific combinations of NF-kB subunits and other proteins 3886 NOTES associated with promoters and enhancers could provide an alternative mechanism to regulate transcription .
These experiments demonstrate that specific combinations of NF-kB subunits act in concert with Tat protein on the HIV LTR in Jurkat cells .
Although the p49 ( 100 ) and p65 subunits act together with the tar-I gene product and p105 ( Rsal ) /p65 and c-rel do not , it is possible that these subunits are active in different cell types or under different transfection conditions .
Such a functional interaction also does not necessarily indicate that there is a specific biochemical interaction between the p49/p65 gene products and Tat .
In fact , it is unlikely that such is the case , since fusion proteins with the heterologous VP16 acidic transactivation domain can also mediate this effect .
Many reports have suggested that Tat can increase expression of HIV by using diverse mechanisms .
Although it can stimulate transcriptional initiation , it is likely that the predominant effect of Tat occurs at the level of transcriptional elongation where it may stabilize the transcription complex and decrease the polarity of transcription ( 6 , 15 , 19 , 33 , 34 ) .
The results described here are consistent with an indirect effect of p49/p65 NF-kB , which may act to increase the number of transcriptional initiation complexes with which Tat-I may interact in order to affect transcriptional elongation ( 6 , 15 , 19 , 33 , 34 ) .
Because different members of the NF- « B family may play different roles in the activation of transcription from the HIV LTR , definition of the subunits in this family which interact with viral genes in different cell types provides further insight into the mechanism of virus induction in cells which contain the HIV provirus .
