This study was initiated to investigate whether a cytokine imbalance oriented toward Th2 type response plays a role in chronic hepatitis B. Cytokine profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated with chronic hepatitis B were analysed by RT-PCR .
Upon HBsAg stimulation , expression of IFN-7 , IL-2 , IL-4 , and IL-10 was detected in 41 % , 8 % , 41 % , and 50 % of the patients , respectively .
Among these cytokines , the expression of IFN-7 was associated with high levels of serum AST/ALT .
However , we could not prove that Th2 type cytokines had a protective effect on hepatocytes .
Upon HBxAg stimulation , there was no recognizable association of cytokine patterns with AST/ALT levels .
In conclusion , production of a Th1 cytokine , IFN-7 , by HBsAg-reactive cells was associated with hepatocyte damage in chronic hepatitis B , while no counteracting effect of Th2 Millina Lee , MyungAe Lee , Sung Ki Lee* , Minsik Son , Sung-Won Cho ' , Sun Park , Hyung-l1 Kim Department of Microbiology , 'Department of Gastroenterology , Ajou University School of Medicine , Suwon , Korea *Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Konkuk University School of Medicine Received : 4 September 1998 Accepted : 31 October 1998 Address for correspondence cytokines produced by those cells was observed .
Key Words : Hepatitis B virus ; Hepatitis B surface antigen ; Cytokines ; Hepatitis B , chronic INTRODUCTION Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is the primary source of chronic hepatitis , liver cirrhosis , and hepatocellular carcinoma ( 1 ) .
Since HBV is a noncytopathic virus , cell-mediated immunity ( CMT ) appears to be responsible for the elimination of HBV-infected hepatocytes and viral clearance ( 1 ) .
Actually , patients with acute hepatitis B are able to produce vigorous proliferative responses of T cells against various HBV antigens , whereas patients with chronic HBV infection show very weak T cell responses ( 1-6 ) .
HBV genome contains four open reading frames encoding HBsAg , HBc/eAg , polymerase , and HBxAg .
Immune response against each HBV antigen may be different quan-titatively and possibly qualitatively .
Proliferative responses of T cells against HBc/eAg are readily observed in patients with acute hepatitis B and during the acute exacerbation period of chronic active hepatitis ( 3-5 ) .
In contrast , T cell responses against HBsAg , which may be important in protective immunity against HBV infection , are hardly detectable in both acute and chronic hepatitis ( 4 , 6 ) .
Immune responses against polymerase and HBxAg are not well characterized yet ( 7 , 8 ) .

logic surveillance and persists in chronic hepatitis B remain unclear , recent studies on the immunoregulation in microbial infections suggest that balances in cytokine production profiles may play a crucial role in determining the resolution or persistence of infection ( 9-11 ) .
Thl type cytokines ( IFN-Y and IL-2 ) , which are principally involved in CMI , can contribute to protection from viral infections , while predominant Th2 type cytokine productions ( IL-4 and IL-10 ) may inhibit anti-viral CMI ( 12 , 13 ) .
Therefore , it can be hypothesized that predominant productions of Th2 type cytokines may be involved in the persistent infection with HBV .
To characterize the cytokine profile associated with chronic hepatitis B , peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) obtained from patients with chronic hepatitis B were stimulated with HBsAg or HBxAg and tested for their cytokine expression responses to antigen stimulation by RT-PCR .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients and HBV antigens Subjects studied were acute and chronic hepatitis B patients attending the gastroenterology services of Ajou University 176 Medical Center .
In chronic hepatitis patients , HBsAg was positive for longer than 6 months .
On the same day PBMCs were obtained from patients , serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) and alanine transaminase ( ALT ) were measured .
Recombinant yeast-derived preparation of HBsAg was kindly provided by the Green Cross Co ( Seoul , Korea ) .
HBxAg was prepared by expression of cloned viral DNA in E. coli using the glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) gene fusion system ( Pharmacia , Sweden ) .
The expression vector pGEM-4T-1 carrying HBx open reading frame ( pGEX-HBx ) was kindly given by Dr. W-K Kim , Institute for Medical Sci-ence , Ajou University , Suwon , Korea .
For the expression of GST-HBx fusion protein , the plasmid was transformed in E. coli cells BL21 .
After cultivating the transformed BL21 in LB medium containing ampicillin until the ODe reached around 0.6 , expression was induced by 0.1 mM IPTG ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) for 5-6 hr .
Cells were centrifuged at 6,000 g for 10 min and washed twice with Tris-HCl buffer solution ( pH 7.4 , 20 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA ) .
The cell pellet was resuspended in the Tris-HCI buffer solution containing 0.5 % NP-40 , sonicated ( Heat system Inc. , U.S.A. ) for 2 min , cooled on ice , and spun down at 10,000 g for 30 min .
Soluble cell extract was collected and filtered with a 0.45 um filter .
The GST-HBx fusion protein was purified by Glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography ( Pharmacia , Sweden ) .
Briefly , the cell extract was applied to a Glutathione Sepharose 4B column .
The column was washed three times with 10 bed volume of 20 mM Tris-HCl and the fusion protein was eluted with a glutathione elution buffer ( pH 8.5 , 50 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM reduced glutathione ) .
The eluate was concentrated using a ultrafiltrator ( Amicon Inc. , Beverly , MA ) and further purified by Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration to use as an antigen .
Culture medium The culture medium used was RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine , 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol , 10mM HEPES , 100 U/mL penicillin , 100 ug/ml streptomycin ( all from GIBCOBRL Lab. , Grand Island , NY ) and 10 % human AB serum ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis , MO ) .
Recombinant human IL-2 ( ¢hIL-2 ) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. HBsAg-reactive T cell populations PBMCs were separated from fresh heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation .
Using 24 well culture plates ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) , PBMCs ( 1 X 10¢/well ) in the complete medium were cultured in the presence of HBsAg ( 5 ug/ml ) for 7 days at 37°C in a humidified 5 % CO incubator .
Then HBsAg-reactive cells were preferentially expanded for 7 days by adding rhIL-2 ( 10 U/mL ) .

For cytokine assays , the HBsAg-reactive cell populations ( 1 X 10°/mL ) was restimulated with HBsAg in the presence of irradiated ( 3,000 Rad ; gamma cell 3000 Elan ; Nordion , Kanata , Ontario ) autologous PBMCs ( 2 X 10 % /mL ) as feed-er/antigen presenting cells .
Supernatants of the antigen-stimulated and control cultures were collected after 4 days and human cytokine ELISA kits ( Endogen , Woburn , MA ) were used for IFN-y and IL-4 .
Cytokine RT-PCR PBMCs ( 1 X 10®/mL ) were cultured in the presence or absence of HBsAg ( 5 ug/ml ) .
After 12 hr , 24 hr and 72 hr , the cells were collected and subjected to a semi-quantitative cytokine RT-PCR .
Antigen-stimulated PBMCs were harvested for total RNA extraction with acid guanidinium thio-cyanate-phenol-chloroform and isopropanol precipitation .
Vacuum-dried pellets were dissolved in 15 ul DEPC-treat-ed-distilled water and incubated for 65°C for 10 min .
After cooling on ice , the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 wL of 2 x reverse transcriptase buffer ( 100 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8.3 , 150 mM KCI , 6 mM MgCl » , 20 mM DTT ) , 0.5 ug oligo-dT ( 18-mer ; Amitof Co. , Boston , MA ) , final concentrations of 200 units of reverse transcriptase ( Superscript IITM , Gibco BRL , Grand Island , NY ) , 0.5 mM dNTP , and 25 U of RNasin ( Promega , Madison , WJ ) .
Tubes were then heated to 95°C for 10 min , and 130 ul of distilled water was added to the 20 ul reaction mixture .
Samples were stored at -20°C until further use .

Twenty-five gl , of each cDNA were amplified in 0.2 mL MicroAmp reaction tubes ( Perkin-Elmer , Branch-burg , NJ ) in the presence of 200 uM final concentration of Cytokine Profiles Associated with Chronic Hepatitis B primers , 200 uM dNTP , 2.5 U of Teg polymerase ( Gibco BRL , Grand Island , NY ) , and PCR buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl » , 50 mM KCI , 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH8.4 in a final volume of 50 ul .
PCR was performed in a thermal cycler ( Perkin Elmer-Cetus , Emeryville , CA ) for 35 cycles : 45 sec denaturation at 94°C , 45 sec annealing at 52°C , and 45 sec extension at 72°C .
After amplification , 10 ul of the PCR product was analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.2 % agarose gel , and the DNA fragments were transferred onto a nitrocellulose paper .
The authenticity of the amplified products was confirmed by Southern blotting and hybridization with P-labeled specific oligonucleotide probes .
Size of the amplified target sequences was validated by running in parallel P-labeled molecular size marker .
A relative amount of each cytokine mRNA to GAPDH mRNA was quantitated using a phosphor imaging analyzer ( BAS2500 , Fuji , Japan ) .
RESULTS Production of IFN- » by HBsAg-reactive T cell populations 'To investigate whether there are any differences in cytokine profiles of HBsAg-reactive T cells between acute and chronic hepatitis , HBsAg-reactive T cell populations were prepared from PBMCs of hepatitis B patients and analysed for their production of IFN-7 - and IL-4 by ELISA .
Upon stimulation with HBsAg , IFN-7 was produced in 80 % of the acute hepatitis patients .
Production of IFN- » was also observed in 25 % of the chronic hepatitis patients ( Table 1 ) .
In contrast , production of IL-4 was not detected in any patient ( Table 1 ) .
Since some chronic hepatitis patients showed IFN-¥ produc-tion , we decided to examine cytokine profiles associated with chronic hepatitis in more detail using RT-PCR .
Cytokine expression profiles of PBMCs upon stimulation with HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B patients For further investigation on cytokine patterns in the immune response against HBsAg during chronic HBV infection , PBMCs were obtained from 12 patients showing various serum levels of AST/ALT , and analysed for their produc- Table 1 .

Depending on cytokine patterns , the patients could be divided into three groups : production of Th2 type alone was observed in 25 % of the patients , both Th2 and Thl type was 42 % , and Thl type alone was 8 % .
While each cytokine expression of IL-10 , IL-4 , and INFE- ?

This result was consistent with poor proliferative responses of T cells to HBsAg stimulation ( data not shown ) .

Approximately 40 % of the patients showed an increased expression of at least one kind of cytokine upon HBxAg stimulation , and the expression of each cytokine was observed in 8-16 % ( Table 3 ) .
Different from that IFN- » expression upon HBsAg stimulation correlated with relatively high levels of AST/ALT , there was no correlation of any cytokine with AST/ALT levels upon HBxAg stimulation .
179 DISCUSSION Immune responses are not very successful in eliminating HBV from the body in chronic hepatitis B .
Since HBV is known to have no cytopathic effect on the infected hepato-cytes , cell-mediated immunity is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular damage and HBV clearance ( 1 ) .
Even though immune evading mechanisms used by HBV are largely unknown , defects in T cell responses have been suspected as a major factor involved in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B ( 1-6 ) .
Different from acute self-limited hepatitis in which protective immunity develops after elimination of HBV , immune responses fail to remove HBV-infected hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis B .
Even more , barely detectable proliferative response of T cells to HBsAg has been consistently reported in patients with hepatitis B , whereas humoral and cellular immunity to HBsAg are easily induced in vaccined individuals ( 4 , 6 ) .
Although the exact mechanisms of T cell tolerance to a HBsAg are unknown , patterns of cytokine production responding to HBsAg can provide a clue to understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of chronic hepatitis B .
To test the hypothesis that immune responses favoring Th2 type cytokine production may lead to chronic infections with HBV , in the present study , we examined cytokine profiles associated with hepatitis B .
At first , we attempted to clone HBsAg-specific T cells from PBMCs of hepatitis B patients to analyze cytokine profiles .
Unfortunately , due to the weak proliferative response of T cells obtained from the hepatitis B patients to HBsAg , we could not clone HBs Ag-specific T cells ( data not shown ) .
Instead , HBsAg-reactive T cell populations were prepared using rhIL-2 .
When these T cell populations were tested for IFN-7 production upon HBsAg stimulation , 25 % of the patients with chronic hepatitis B as well as 80 % of the patients with acute hepatitis B showed IFN- » production analysed by ELISA ( Table 1 ) .
As expected , none of the HBsAg-reactive T cell populations showed significant in vitro proliferative responses to HBsAg stimulation ( data not shown ) .
This may be explained by hardly detectable production of IL-2 by these T cell populations ( data not shown ) .
This result indicates that HBsAg-reactive T cells have defects in the ability to produce IL-2 upon antigenic stimulation , but they are still able to produce other Thl type cytokine , i.e .
IFN-y , even in chronic hepatitis B .
In contrast , production of IL-4 was not detected by ELISA .
Thl type pattern of secreted cytokines can be considered as an appropriate response of the immune system to inhibit viral replication and HBV eradication .
Mechanisms by which IEN-7 favors the elimination of HBV may include enhancement of CTL activation , direct anti-viral activity , in-creased expression of MHC class I molecules on infected cells , and activation of macrophages ( 25-28 ) .
Anti-HBV effect of 180 HBV was shown by a transgenic mouse model showing that adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T lymphocytes producing IFN-7 could inhibit HBV replication without cell lysis ( 16 ) .
Recently , an association of a predominant Thl cytokine profile of HBcAg-specific T cells with acute self-limited hepatitis B was reported ( 17 ) .
Although T cell proliferative responses to HBsAg are not as remarkable as those to HBcAg , roles of HBsAg-reactive T cells have been implicated in viral clearance by several investigators ( 19-22 ) .
For example , Chisari and his colleagues reported CTL responses to epitopes of HBsAg in most patients with acute hepatitis , while there were no such responses in patients with chronic hepatitis ( 22 ) .
In addition , the results of our previous study showed a correlation of - production by HBsAg-reactive T cells with acute self-limited hepatitis B ( 18 ) .
Meanwhile , Barnaba et al .
cloned CD4+ HBV envelope antigen-reactive T cells from chronic active hepatitis patients , and found that these T cells showed signs of cytotoxicity only when they produced IFN- ( 20 ) .
In agreement with this finding , we observed that the production of IFN-Y by PBMCs upon HBsAg stimulation was associated with higher levels of hepatocyte damage ( Fig .
3 ) .
The importance of Thl type immune responses in the development of cell-mediated immunity is also supported by a recent longitudinal study showing that serum levels of IL-12 , a cytokine which is essential for the differentiation of T cells towards Thl type , was associated with the clearance of HBV and anti-H Be seroconversion ( 23 ) .
On the other hand , a cytokine balance favoring Th2 type cytokine production such as IL-4 and IL-10 has been associated with progressive virus infections .
For example , the shift from Thl to ThO or Th2 profiles was reported in acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( 14 , 15 ) .
Because clinically overt acute hepatitis B is generally self-limited , it is not easy to examine cytokine profiles of the initial immune response to HBV in the chronic hepatitis B patients .
Therefore , the present study was performed on chronic hepatitis patients , showing variable degrees of liver damages as evidenced by increased serum AST/ALT levels .
Expression of both Th2 type cytokine ( s ) and Thl type cytokine ( s ) was observed in approximately 50 % of chronic hepatitis B patients in our study .
This result is in agreement with a recent report showing that T cell populations in the liver infiltrate secreted both Th1 ( IFN- » ) and Th2 cytokines ( IL-4 and IL-5 ) ( 24 ) .
As the study was performed on HBV non-specific T cells in the liver of chronic hepatitis B patients , cytokine profiles of HBV antigen-specific T cells were not demonstrated .
At the moment , available information about the cytokine production patterns of HBsAg-specific T cells in chronic hepatitis B is limited , because few patients and clones have been studied ( 20 ) .
Results of the present study indicate the existence of a Th2 type response M. Lee , M.A .
Lee , S.K .
Lee , et al .
to HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B patients and it appeared to be combined with Thl response in the patients with more severe liver damage ( Table 2 ) .
Our results indicated that the production of Th1l cytokines could contribute to antiviral protective immunity in both acute and chronic hepatitis B .
The effect of Thl response might be insufficient for complete removal of HBV in chronic hepatitis B .
There is a possibility that concomitant-ly produced Th2 type cytokines might counteract the antiviral effect of Th1 cytokines .
However , we could not observe the protective effect of Th2 type cytokine on the hepatocytes .
This may be possibly due to relatively weak T cell responses to HBsAg compared to those of HBcAg ( 4 , 5 ) .
Unfortunately cytokine profiles of HBcAg-reactive T cells in chronic hepatitis B are not clear yet .
To investigate cytokine expression patterns on HBxAg stimulation , PMBCs from patients with chronic hepatitis B were stimulated with GST-HBx fusion protein .
Although HBx protein has been reported to be immunogenic on a T cell level in acute hepatitis B ( 8 ) , in our hands proliferative responses of T cells to HBxAg were hardly detectable in chronic hepatitis B ( data not shown ) .
However , by RT-PCR approximately 40 % of patients showed cytokine expression response upon HBxAg stimulation analysed .
There was no significant relationship between cytokine profiles and hepatocyte damage .
It is likely that Thl responses to HBxAg seems to be weaker than those to HBsAg .
In conclusion , we could not show that a predominant production of Th2 type cytokines upon HBsAg or HBxAg antigen stimulation may cause persistent infection of HBV .
However , lacking data from other investigators on cytokine profiles of HBV-specific T cells , the roles of Th2 type responses in viral persistency should be further studied .
As our data consistently indicated , the production of IFN-7 by HBsAg-reactive cells was associated with HBV clearance .
Recently it was reported that IL-12 could induce proliferation and IFN-7 - production of HBsAg-stimulated PBMCs in vitro ( 29 ) .
If we can find a way to induce a strong Thl type immune response to HBsAg , successful resolution of HBV in chronic hepatitis B can be possible .
