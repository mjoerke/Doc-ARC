Multiple Proteins Interact with the Nuclear Inhibitory Protein Repressor Element in the Human Interleukin-3 Promoter* ( Received for publication , July 5 , 1995 ) Kurt Engeland # § , Nancy C. Andrews # ( | , and Bernard Mathey-Prevot ?
** From the { Department of Pediatric Oncology , the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children 's Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 and ( Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Children 's Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 T cell expression of interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) is directed by positive and negative cis-acting DNA elements clustered within 300 base pairs of the transcriptional start site .
A strong repressor element , termed nuclear inhibitory protein ( NIP ) , was previously mapped to a segment of the IL-3 promoter between nucleotides -271 and -250 .
Functional characterization of this element demonstrates that it can mediate repression when linked in cis to a heterologous promoter .
DNA binding experiments were carried out to characterize the repressor activity .
Using varying conditions , three distinct complexes were shown to interact specifically with the NIP region , although only one correlates with repressor activity .
Complex 1 results from binding of a ubiquitous polypeptide that recognizes the 3 ' portion of this sequence and is not required for repression .
Complex 2 corresponds to binding of transcription factor ( upstream stimulatory fac-tor ) to an E-box motif in the 5 ' portion of the NIP region .
DNA binding specificity of complex 3 overlaps with that of upstream stimulatory factor but is clearly distinct .
To determine which of the latter two complexes represents NIP activity , we incorporated small alterations into the NIP site of an IL-3 promoter-linked reporter construct and examined their effects on NIP-mediated repression .
Functional specificity for repression matches the DNA binding specificity of complex 3 ; both repressor activity and complex 3 binding require the consensus sequence CTCACNTNC .
Human interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) '' is a potent growth factor , which supports early hematopoietic progenitor cells and potentiates lineage-specific effects of later acting growth factors ( 1 , 2 ) .
IL-3 expression is restricted to activated T cells and NK cells ( 3-6 ) and is regulated primarily at the level of transcription ( 7-9 ) .
cis-acting promoter elements governing tissue-specific and ac-tivation-dependent expression are found within 300 base pairs * This work has been funded in part by National Institutes of Health Grant RO1 DK41758 ( to B. M.-P. ) .

( bp ) of the transcriptional start site ( 8-13 ) .
Promoter deletion experiments have identified two activating sites referred to as ACT-1 ( NFIL-3 ) and AP-1/Elf-1 ( 8-10 , 12 ) .
In addition , there is a powerful repressor site , which binds an activity termed nuclear inhibitory protein ( NIP ) ( 9 ) .
Functional experiments in transfected T cells localized the NIP element between nucleotides -271 and -250 upstream of the transcriptional start ( 9 ) .
These experiments showed that , in the absence of AP-1 and EIf-1 sites , the NIP element blocks activation mediated by the downstream ACT-1 and CBF sites , thus silencing IL-3 expression in activated T cells ( 9 ) .
The nature of the NIP repressor has remained elusive subsequent to this initial characterization .
Studies with the human interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) promoter identified a repressor site , NRE-A , which interacts with a zinc finger DNA binding protein ( 14 ) .
Since the promoters of the IL-2 and IL-3 genes have common characteristics and function exclusively in activated T cells ( 5 ) , it was possible that NIP and NRE-A sites might be related .
A second possible identity for NIP was suggested by sequence analysis , which revealed that the NIP site contains a consensus E-box sequence ( 15 , 16 ) that might be recognized by a helix-loop-helix transcription factor .
To better define how NIP interacts with the IL-3 promoter and to characterize the protein mediating repressor activity , we have determined the nucleotide requirements for NIP function .
In parallel we have investigated three proteins that bind to the repressor site to determine which correlates with the repressor activity of NIP .
Taken together , our results show that NIP and NRE-A are distinct elements and that the repressor protein NIP does not belong to the E-box binding class of transcriptional regulators .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines-The gibbon T cell line MLA 144 ( 17 ) was maintained in 5 % CO , at 37°C in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and antibiotics ( 50 units/ml penicillin ; 50 ug/ml streptomycin } .
The human Jurkat T cell line , the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed Raji cell line , the K562 erythroleukemia cell line , and a murine Abelson-murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cell line were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and antibiotics .
Mouse erythroleukemia cells were cultured in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium supplemented with 2.5 % fetal calf serum , 7.5 % calf serum , and antibiotics .
Oligonucleotides and IL-3 Promoter Constructs-Sequences of one strand of the double-stranded oligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) are indicated in Fig .
2 .
All IL-3 promoter segments are cloned upstream of a reporter gene construct consisting of a modified human IL-3 gene ( IL3® ) ( 9 ) .
The reporter gene -173/IL3 '' has been described ( 9 ) .
For ( NIP ) -173/IL3* , a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning nt -267 to -244 of the IL-3 promoter ( 18 ) was ligated upstream of -173/1L3 '' .
For -267/IL3 '' , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) was used to amplify a segment of the IL-3 promoter between nt -267 and -1 .
The 5 ' primer used in the reaction incorporated a HindIII restriction site for cloning purposes .
The PCR fragment was digested with HindIII and Smal ( position -61 in the IL-3 promoter ) and sub 24572 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog Characterization of the NIP Repressor Site cloned into the unique HindIII and Smeal sites of the IL-3 promoter fragment in -173/IL3*® .
This resulted in an L3 '' reporter gene linked to an IL-3 promoter extending to nt -267 .
Upstream primers that incorporated mutations in the NIP site listed in Fig .
2 were used on the -267/IL3* DNA template to generate ( by PCR ) M1 , M2 , M5 , M6 , M7 , M8 , M9 , and M10 IL3* reporter gene mutants .
Sequence integrity for all new constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the promoter region between the HindIII and Smal sites .
All oligonucleotides ( for PCR and EMSA ) were obtained from the Oligonucleotide Core Facility at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute .
Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) Promoter Constructs-For a fragment of the human GM-CSF promoter from nt -215 to -17 was subcloned immediately upstream of the presumed start site in the IL3* reporter gene at a BanII site .
For ( NIP ) -215 % /IL3* , the same double-stranded NIP oligonucleotide present in ( NIP ) -173/IL3* was subcloned upstream of the reporter gene .
The area of interest was sequenced to confirm the integrity of the construct .
DNA Electroporation-4 X 10 '' MLA 144 cells were resuspended in 3.5 ml of RPMI medium lacking fetal calf serum .
For each electropora-tion , 50 ug of plasmid DNA was added to the cell suspension and incubated on ice for 5 min .
The suspension was split into four aliquots and transferred to disposable cuvettes for electroporation in ProGene-tor II ( Hoefer Scientific Instruments ) set at 275 V , 960 uF .
Cells were then resuspended in a total of 50 ml of RPMI medium complete with fetal calf serum .
After 36-40 h cells were stimulated for 9 h with phorbol 12-myristate 18-acetate ( 10 ng/ml final concentration ) .
Cells were harvested , and RNA was isolated as described ( 5 ) .
RNA Isolation and RNase Protection Assay-Total RNA was isolated , and expression of the reporter genes was analyzed by an RNase protection assay ( 9 ) .
The probe used is complementary to the first exon of the IL-3 reporter gene , including an insertion of a 12-bp XhoI linker at a Hincll site .
After ribonuclease A and T1 digestion , transcripts corresponding to the IL-3 reporter genes protect a 226-nt fragment , whereas endogenous MLA 144 IL-3 transcripts ( lacking the 12-bp linker ) give rise to two protected fragments of 151 and 63 nt , respectively ( 9 ) .
EMSAs-Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from different cell lines by the Dignam procedure ( 19 ) or a modified procedure by Andrews and Faller ( 20 ) .
T cell extracts ( unstimulated and stimulated ) were prepared from the Jurkat and MLA 144 cell lines .
Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 18-acetate and 0.5 um ionomycin for 6 h prior to nuclear extract preparation .
Protease inhibitors ( from Boehringer Mannheim and Sigma ) were included in all extract preparation steps : 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride , 1 ug/ml pepstatin A , 0.1 ug/ml leupeptin , and 0.4 ug/ml aprotinin .

Labeled oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis through nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels .
Bands were excised , and oligonucleotides were eluted , precipitated , and resuspended in H , O .
Oligonucleotide probes were incubated with nuclear proteins at a concentration of approximately 100 fmol/15 ul assay .
Two different buffers were used for the binding reaction : buffer A ( 10 mm Hepes/NaOH , pH 7.8 , 50 mM potassium glutamate , 5 mM MgCl , , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 5 % ( v/v ) glycerol , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 pg/15 ul poly ( dI-dC ) ) and buffer B ( 10 mm Tris/HCl ] , pH 7.5 , 100 mm NaCl , 1 mm EDTA , 4 % ( v/v ) glycerol , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 20 pM ZnSQ , , and 1 ug/15 pl poly ( dA } poly ( dT ) ) .
Nuclear extracts were incubated at a concentration of about 5 pg of total protein/assay with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes for 20 min at 22 °C .
Competition experiments were performed by adding excess unlabeled oligonucleotides to the binding reaction ( at 40 ng/15 ul , a 50-100-fold excess ) , 15 min prior to adding the probe .
The unrelated oligonucleotide ( non-specific ) used in competition was AGCTTACGTCTGTGGATC .

The NIP repressor site functions in a different position in the IL-3 promoter and in a heterologous promoter .
A schematic diagram of the wild-type IL-3 promoter is shown at the fop .
Reporter genes indicated on the right were transfected into MLA 144 cells , and expression of these constructs was monitored by RNase protection using a modified IL-3 first exon probe ( 9 ) .
The filled arrowhead indicates a 226-nt protected fragment resulting from expression of the reporter gene ( 9 ) .
The prominent 151-nt fragment ( in the lower part of the gels ) results from protection of the probe by gibbon endogenous IL-3 mRNA and serves as internal control for loading ( 9 ) .
A , constructs a and b contain a truncated portion of the IL-3 promoter ( -173 ) , containing the known regulatory sites ACT-1 ( 10 ) , CBF ( 11 ) , and DB1 ( 13 ) and other potential sites ( CK1 , CK2 , and CACC ) ( 9 , 11 ) .
In construct b , the NIP segment was fused to the -173 promoter , thus altering the position of the NIP site relative to the wild-type promoter .
B , in constructs c and d , the IL-3 promoter was replaced by a GM-CSF promoter fragment ( -215 ) known to direct regulated expression of GM-CSF in activated T cells ( 28 ) .
Construct d contains the NIP site upstream of the -215 GM-CSF promoter .

RESULTS The NIP Element Is a General Repressor Site-Deletion analysis of the IL-3 promoter revealed the existence of a silencing element , NIP , between bp -267 and -244 ( 8 , 9 ) .
To determine whether this region exhibits a repressor function outside of its usual context , it was placed upstream of a truncated version of the IL-3 and GM-CSF promoters ( Fig .
1 , A and B ) .
The activity of these constructs was measured by RNase protection after transient transfection into the gibbon T cell line MLA 144 , as described previously ( 9 ) .
Expression directed by the truncated -173 IL-3 promoter ( -173/IL-3* reporter gene ) was completely silenced when the NIP element was placed just upstream of it ( Fig .
1A , lanes a and b ) .
Consistent with the IL-3 promoter results , expression of the reporter gene was drasti- 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 24574 +270 ~241 | E-box | NIP gaTccrCcTesREETECTGCCATGCTTCCCATCTag NIP-5 !

cally reduced in activated T cells , when the NIP element was placed immediately upstream of the -215 GM-CSF promoter ( Fig .
1B , lanes c and d ) .
These results indicate that the NIP site can function as a silencer element in a heterologous position and in a heterologous promoter .
The NIP Site interacts with Three DNA-binding Com-plexes-To characterize the protein ( s ) responsible for the silencing function of the NIP site , in vitro binding experiments were carried out .
A double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the region between -270 and -241 of the IL-3 promoter ( see Fig .
2 ) was used as a probe in an EMSA .
In agreement with our previous findings ( 9 ) , a dominant protein-DNA complex ( complex 1 ) was detected with this probe ( Fig .
3A ) .
Complex 1 is specific , since it is competed by excess unlabeled NIP probe and not by excess nonspecific competitor ( Fig .
3A ) .
NIP-3 ' , an oligonucleotide consisting of the 3 ' half of the NIP probe ( Fig .
2 ) also competed complex 1 as well as the faster migrating bands , which represent degradation products of complex 1 .
In addition , a fainter complex ( complex 2 ) forms over the NIP probe .
Because of its relatively weak binding over the NIP probe , complex 2 had not been recognized in past experiments ( 8 , 9 ) .
Complex 2 binding was competed by excess NIP and NIP-5 oligonucleotides but not by NIP-3 ' oligonucleotides .
Last , there was a slower migrating doublet at the top of the gel , which was competed by NIP but not by NIP-5 ' or NIP-3 ' oligonucleotides .
The nature of this doublet was not pursued since its detection failed to correlate with repressor activity ( data not shown ) .
To analyze formation of complexes 1 and 2 over the NIP region , NIP-3 ' and NIP-5 ' probes ( Fig .
2 ) were used in EMSA ( Fig .
3 , B , C , and D ) .
The NIP-3 ' probe specifically bound Characterization of the NIP Repressor Site complex 1 ( Fig .
3B ) , while the NIP-5 ' probe failed to do so ( Fig .
3C ) .
Instead , NIP-5 ' bound complex 2 .
Complex 2 is specific and often gives rise to two bands , one major band and a slightly faster migrating minor band .
The two bands exhibit identical DNA binding specificity in EMSA competition experiments ( Fig .
5 and data not shown ) .
To maximize detection of all proteins binding to the NIP region , we carried out EMSAs under a variety of different conditions .
There was a striking difference in the pattern of complexes detected when poly ( dA ) poly ( dT ) was used as nonspecific carrier DNA in place of poly ( dI-dC ) .
As shown in Fig .
3D , an additional complex ( complex 3 ) was detected using the 5 ' portion of the NIP sequence , which migrated differently from complex 2 described above .
The assignment of the slower migrating band as complex 2 is based on competition experiments using a variety of mutated probes ( Figs .
2 and 8 and data not shown ) .
The faster migrating band in Fig .
3D is not consistently seen in our different nuclear extracts ( see Fig .
8 ) , and it can not be fully competed by excess unlabeled oligonucleotide .
Thus , three distinct , specific complexes ( complexes 1 , 2 , and 3 ) are reproducibly detected over the NIP site .
Binding of Complex 1 Is Not Necessary for Repression-The most prominent complex detected with the NIP probe is complex 1 .
To examine further the DNA binding specificity and function of complex 1 , a mutant oligonucleotide was prepared in which four bp were deleted from the 3 ' portion of the NIP sequence ( mutant NIP-A ; Fig .
2 ) .
As shown in Fig .
44 , this oligonucleotide did not compete for complex 1 binding when added in excess and failed to bind complex 1 when radiolabeled and used as a probe .
Binding of complex 2 to NIP-A was unaffected , but detection required a much longer exposure than that shown for this experiment ( data not shown ) .
The NIP-A mutation was incorporated into the -267/IL3* reporter construct to determine whether loss of complex 1 binding correlated with a change in repressor activity at the NIP site .
Its activity was compared with -267/IL3* ( wild-type ) , which shows repression of the reporter gene , and a construct in which the NIP site has been deleted , -250/IL3* ( NIP minus ) , which shows no repression .
As displayed in Fig .
4B , the 4-bp NIP-A deletion had no effect on repression function .
Thus , complex 1 does not correlate with NIP activity , and its binding is not required for repression to take place .
Complex 2 Is an E-box Complex Immunologically Related to USF-To characterize the DNA binding specificity exhibited by complex 2 , several mutated oligonucleotides ( listed in Fig .
2 ) were used to compete binding of complex 2 to the NIP-5 ' probe ( Fig .
5 ) .
This experiment demonstrates that the integrity of the E-box consensus sequence in the NIP-5 ' probe is essential for complex 2 binding .
Indeed , a « E2 site ( 21 ) , which has only the E-box consensus sequence in common with the NIP-5 ' probe , completely competes binding of complex 2 .
A compilation of the results observed with the several mutants reveals that only nucleotides forming the E-box consensus , i.e .
CACNTG , are necessary .
Nucleotides flanking the E-box core sequence do not influence binding of complex 2 in vitro .
Also , the second of the two cytidines in the middle of the E-box can be mutated without affecting binding of complex 2 ( mutant M6 ) .
Since complex 2 can be detected in all cells tested and requires the E-box consensus for binding , we investigated the possibility that complex 2 forms from binding of known ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix proteins .
Antisera raised against proteins belonging to the E2-2 family of transcription factors failed to interfere with the formation of complex 2 on the NIP-5 ' oligonucleotide ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , formation of complex 2 on the NIP-5 probe was blocked by the addition of an antiserum recognizing the 20 C-terminal amino acids of USF ( 22 ) ( Fig .
6A ) .

Complex 1 is not involved in repression .
A , nuclear extracts from unstimulated Jurkat cells were used in an EMSA with probes shown at the bottom of the gels ( NIP probe and mutant NIP-A probe ( see Fig .

The presence or absence ( No ) and the type of competitor oligonucleotides are indicated above each lane .
Identical results were obtained with extracts from stimulated Jurkat cells or extracts from MLA 144 cells before and after T-cell activation ( data not shown ) .
B , the functional consequence of the 4-bp deletion ( NIP-A ) engineered in the NIP site was tested in MLA 144 cells as described in Fig .
1 .
Expression of the IL-3 reporter gene ( 9 ) mediated by a wild-type IL-3 promoter fragment containing the NIP site ( -267/IL3* ) and by the same fragment containing the NIP-A mutation was compared with that obtained with a promoter fragment lacking a full NIP site ( -250/IL3*® ) .
The level of expression of this latter construct is equivalent to that of -173/IL3* ( data not shown ) .
The protected fragment corresponding to the reporter gene is indicated by the arrowhead .
As in Fig .
1 , the prominent 151-nt fragment at the bottom of the gel ( resulting from protection by endogenous IL-3 mRNA ) indicates equal loading for RNA .
interaction appears to be specific , since preincubation of the antiserum with excess peptide against which it was raised largely restores binding of complex 2 with the NIP-5 ' probe ( Fig .
6A ) .
The E-box in the NIP-5 ' probe differs from the previously described USF consensus sequence ( 22 ) .
We therefore used a probe containing a bona fide USF binding site ( from the adenovirus major late promoter ) to confirm our initial observa-tion .
Using the USF probe under identical conditions , a complex with the same mobility as complex 2 ( Fig .
6 , A and B ) can be detected .

Binding specificity of complex 2 is identical to the E-box consensus .
Nuclear extract from unstimulated MLA 144 cells was used in an EMSA with the NIP-5 ' probe .
The binding reaction was performed in buffer A in the absence or presence of various competitors , as indicated above each lane .
These conditions preclude detection of complex 3 ( see Fig .
3 , C and D ) .
Sequences of the competitors used are given in Fig .
2 .
Identical results were obtained with nuclear extracts derived from Jurkat cells .
The deduced binding consensus for complex 2 is shown at the bottom .
probe is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than it is for the NIP-5 ' probe .
Anti-USF antiserum interferes with binding of this complex ( Fig .
6B ) .
In addition , a faint supershift is apparent for this probe .
While a similar supershift is not readily observed in Fig .
6A , it is likely that detection of such a supershift requires a stronger signal for complex 2 than what is generally observed with the NIP-5 ' probe .
Alternatively , complex 2 may only be related to USF and react less strongly with the antiserum .
To confirm our observation that complex 2 is USF or USF-related , purified USF from Hela cells was incubated with NIP-5 ' and USF probes ( Fig .
6C ) .
A single complex with identical mobility is detected with both probes .
Again , purified USF binds with much higher affinity to the viral USF site than it does to the NIP-5 ' probe .
Competition experiments using USF , NIP-5 ' , and unrelated oligonucleotides confirmed the specificity of these bindings ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , these experiments suggest that the protein component of complex 2 and USF are the same or highly related polypeptides .
Repression by NIP Does Not Require an Intact E-box-As shown in Fig .
3D , complex 3 also forms on the NIP-5 ' probe .
To test whether binding of either complex 2 or complex 3 correlated with repressor function , we performed a detailed muta-tional analysis .
Nucleotides in and around the E-box consensus sequence were altered in the context of the -267/IL,3* reporter gene .
The effect of these mutations on reporter gene expression was assayed ( Fig .
7 ) .
The majority of the mutations interfered with repression and restored reporter gene expression to a level comparable with that observed with the -173 promoter ( Fig .
7 , compare lanes M1 , M2 , M5 , M7 , M9 , and M10 with lane NIP Characterization of the NIP Repressor Site minus ) .
In contrast , mutations present in the M6 and M8 constructs do not abrogate repression .
These observations , together with results obtained from three additional mutations in the area of the E-box sequence , define the functional consensus for NIP repression to be CTCACNTNC ( Fig .
7 and data not shown ) .
This consensus indicates that complex 2/USF can not represent the repressor , since the invariant G in the E-box can be mutated to a T ( mutant M8 ) without affecting repression , even though it abrogates binding of this factor in competition experiments ( Fig .
5 , lane M8 ) .
Complex 3 Is the NIP Repressor-Having excluded complex 2/USF as the repressor , we turned our attention to complex 3 .
The NIP-5 ' oligonucleotide duplex and four informative mutant probes were used in EMSA to identify a protein complex that showed a binding pattern matching the NIP functional consensus .
The NIP-5 ' wild-type probe as well as mutant M6 and MBS probes should bind the repressor complex , while the mutant M1 and M9 probes should not .
In addition , probe MS can help discriminate between E-box binding proteins ( which can not be the repressor ) and the NIP repressor complex itself .
Only complex 3 fulfills the above requirements ( Fig .
8A ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that complex 3 is the NIP repressor complex .
We have designated this activity NIP-C3 , for NIP-complex 3 .
The IL-2 promoter , which also directs T cell-specific expres-sion , contains a repressor site , NRE-A , which binds a zinc finger protein ( 14 ) .
Comparison of the complex ( es ) binding to the NRE-A and NIP sites showed them to have different mo-bilities in EMSA .
Furthermore , NIP oligonucleotides did not compete specific binding to the NRE-A probe ; nor did NRE-A oligonucleotides compete NIP-C3 binding to its cognate site ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that the IL-2 repressor and NIP-C3 are distinct from each other .
NIP-C3 Can Be Detected in Different Cell Types and Organ-isms-To further characterize NIP-C3 , nuclear extracts from various primate and murine cell lines were tested with the same set of probes ( Fig .
8 , A and B ) .
NIP-C3 was detected in all cases .
An equivalent amount of this complex is present in nuclear extracts from unstimulated and stimulated human Jurkat T cells ( Fig .
8 , A and B ) .
As already shown , NIP-C3 is detected in nuclear extracts from the gibbon T cell line MLA 144 .
The prominent complex that migrates ahead of NIP-C3 is unlikely to be a breakdown product of NIP-C3 since it binds to probe M9 .
Its significance , if any , is unknown .
NIP-C3 is also detected in erythroleukemic K562 cells , mouse erythroleukemia cells , human B cells ( Raji ) , mouse pre-B cells ( 2M3 ) , and mouse myotube ( C2DM ) ( Fig .
8B ) .
Although the relative amount of NIP-C3 varies from cell line to cell line , NIP-C3 migration appears to be the same in all preparations , with the exception of the faster component in the NIP-C3 doublet in mouse pre-B cells .
This component may have arisen from proteolytic degradation or may represent an altered form of NIP-C3 .
DISCUSSION The presence of a negative regulatory element within the IL-3 promoter was originally recognized when a truncated IL-3 promoter lacking the AP-1/Elf-1 sites was tested in T cell lines ( 8 , 9 , 12 ) .
These experiments localized this element between nt -244 and -270 of the IL-3 promoter and showed that it also functions as a repressor in primary T lymphocytes ( 23 ) , B cells , and Hela cells ( 12 ) .
We have shown that the repression function of the NIP region ( -267 to -244 ) is preserved when placed in a different location within the IL-3 promoter or transferred in cis to a heterologous promoter ( Fig .
1 ) .
Thus , repression through the NIP site is not cell-restricted and may play a more general role than the one involved in IL-3 regulation .

Complex 2 is related to or identical to USF .
A , nuclear extracts from unstimulated Jurkat cells were tested in EMSA with a NIP-5 ' probe in buffer A .
The nuclear extract was either directly added to the binding reaction ( first Zane ) , incubated with an antibody raised against the 20 C-terminal amino acids of USF ( Zane eUSF-Ab ) , or incubated with the same antibody blocked with excess peptide against which the antibody was raised ( Zane « USF-Ab + peptide ) prior to the addition of the probe .
B , the same experiment was performed except that a USF binding site derived from the adenovirus major late promoter ( see Fig .

The functional consensus for NIP repression is different from the E-box consensus .
Reporter gene constructs with different mutations in the -267 IL-3 promoter fragment ( see Fig .
2 for sequences ) were assayed as described in Fig .
1 .
Migration of the protected fragment derived from expression of the reporter gene is indicated by the arrowhead .
Plasmid -173/1L3* ( lane labeled NIP minus ) , which lacks the NIP site , and plasmid -267/1L3* ( lane labeled wild-type ) containing an intact NIP element served as controls .
Equal loading for RNA was achieved as indicated by the prominent 151-nt fragment at the bottom of the gel .
Results from the eight mutants shown here and three additional mutants ( data not shown ) define the consen- sus for NIP repressor function indicated at the bottom .
The NIP region was used as a probe to identify proteins that might mediate its repression function .
Using various assay conditions for DNA binding in vitro , we were able to detect three specific complexes ( Fig .
3 ) .
The most prominent complex is complex 1 .
Partial characterization and purification of complex 1 indicate that it is a ubiquitous protein of with a molecular mass of 63 kDa . ?
It forms on the 3 ' half of the NIP site and is dispensable for repression function ( Fig .
4 ) .
Its role in IL-3 regulation remains unknown .

ties has been described , which binds a site in the stromelysin gene promoter and appears to mediate phorbol ester activation in cooperation with a nearby AP-1 site ( 24 ) .
The 5 ' half of the NIP site interacts with two distinct protein complexes to form complex 2 and complex 3 .
Both complexes are expressed ubiquitously ( Fig .
8 and data not shown ) and appear to be conserved across different species .
Since a consensus sequence for an E-box binding protein is present in the 5 half of the NIP site , we sought to determine whether either of the two complexes might be a member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors .
Eleven mutant oligonucleotides of the NIP-5 ' probe were tested as competitors in EMSAs revealing that the binding specificity of complex 2 ( CACNTG ) matched the general consensus sequence of an E-box site ( CANNTG ) .
The identity of complex 2 was explored using antibodies directed against ubiquitous E-box proteins .
Complex 2 was disrupted by an antiserum recognizing the general transcriptional activator USF .
Additional experiments established that complex 2 is identical or closely related to USF .
Complex 2 can not be the NIP repressor , however , since its DNA-binding specificity differs from the functional repressor consensus sequence CTCACNTNC .
Other E-box binding proteins are also unlikely candidates , since a mutation altering the invariant G in the NIP E-box core had no effect on repressor function .
Since neither complex 1 nor complex 2 binding correlated with repressor activity , we focused on complex 3 , the only remaining candidate for this function .
The use of different informative mutant oligonucleotides as DNA probes in EMSA showed that , among the three complexes that form on the NIP region , only complex 3 , designated NIP-C3 , displayed the appropriate specificity for being the repressor .
NIP-C3 is expressed in a wide array of tissues and species ( Fig .
8 and data not shown ) .
Its binding in vitro is exquisitely sensitive to the type of nonspecific DNA present in the binding 610Z '01 uo 1son $ Aq /S10°0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wrojr popeopumog 24578 Characterization of the NIP Repressor Site B Bo , s $ A < & yop y £5 3° 3° £ , 3° 3° 3° Different Probes Different Probes S -- taman msl .

We were unable to detect NIP-C3 when poly ( dI-dC ) was used as carrier .
This behavior is reminiscent of the zinc finger transcription factor SEF1 , which was originally identified as a transcriptional activator of the 8-crystallin enhancer and was subsequently found to repress E2-box-mediated gene activation through competition of binding .
Although NIP-C3 and dEF1 share similar binding specificities , they differ in recognition of at least one important position , where the presence of a specific nucleotide inactivates NIP repressor function while it favors 8EF1 function ( 25 ) .
Although the two proteins may share similar mechanisms of repression , the above difference strongly argues that the two factors are different .
There is accumulating evidence that a growing number of proteins function by displacing helix-loop-helix transcription factors from their cognate E-box sequences .
Indeed , another zinc finger protein , ZEB , was recently shown to be able to silence the IgH enhancer by displacing the E2A complex from its cognate site ( 26 ) .
Since binding sites for complex 2/USF and the repressor significantly overlap , a dynamic equilibrium of occupancy by complex2/USF and NIP-C3 over the 5° portion of the NIP site may dictate appropriate IL-3 expression in an analogous manner ( 27 ) .
Why should the IL-3 promoter contain a strong repressor element ?
IL-3 is a potent growth factor , which plays multiple , complementary roles in normal hematopoiesis ( 1 ) .
Meticulous control of its production may be necessary to prevent unbridled proliferation of progenitor cells and to meet the body 's fluctuating needs for differentiated cells .
IL-3 may be an example of a protein that is so deleterious when overproduced that blocking its expression may be of greater importance than activating its expression .
It has previously been shown that the proximal portion of the IL-3 promoter activates a basal level of transcription in a variety of cell types ( 12 ) , yet IL-3 is produced only by activated T cells ( 5 ) .
The NIP repressor may serve as a clamp that normally prevents IL-3 transcription in all cells .
Its effect , however , can be specifically abrogated when the upstream AP-1 and Elf-1 sequences engage proteins expressed only in activated T cells .
Future studies must be aimed at understanding the mechanism by which factors acting at the AP-1 and EIf-1 sites relieve NIP repression .
