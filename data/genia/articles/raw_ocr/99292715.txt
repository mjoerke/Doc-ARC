Potent and Stable Attenuation of Live-HIV-1 by Gain of a Proteolysis-resistant Inhibitor of NF-B ( IxB-a « 832/36A ) and the Implications for Vaccine Development* ( Received for publication , February 25 , 1999 , and in revised form , April 7 , 1999 ) Ileana Quinto $ §1 , Massimo Mallardo # , Francesca Baldassarre ? # ] , Giuseppe Scalaf $ § , George Englund** , and Kuan-Teh Jeang** From the { Dipartimento di Biochimica e Biotecnologie Mediche , Université degli Studi di Napoli `` Federico II '' , Napoli I-80131 , Italy , the **Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale e Clinica , Universita degli Studi di Catanzaro , Catanzaro I-88100 Italy , and the ||Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology , NIAID , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892-0460 Live-attenuated human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIVs ) are candidates for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) vaccine .
Based on the simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) model for AIDS , loss-of-function ( e.g .
deletion of accessory genes such as nef ) has been forwarded as a primary approach for creating enfeebled , but replication-competent , HIV-1/SIV .
Regrettably , recent evidence suggests that loss-of-function alone is not always sufficient to prevent the emergence of virulent mutants .
New strategies that attenuate via mechanisms distinct from loss-of-function are needed for enhancing the safety phenotype of viral genome .
Here , we propose gain-of-function to be used simultaneously with loss-of-function as a novel approach for attenuating HIV-1 .
We have constructed an HIV-1 genome carrying the cDNA of a proteolysis-resistant nuclear factor- « B inhibitor ( IxB-a832/36A ) in the nef region .
HIV-1 expressing IxB- « 832/36A down-regulates viral expression and is highly attenuated in both Jurkat and peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
We provide formal proof that the phenotypic and attenuating characteristics of IxB-e « 832/36A permit its stable maintenance in a live , replicating HIV-1 despite 180 days of forced ex vivo passaging in tissue culture .
As compared with other open-reading frames embedded into HIV/SIV genome , this degree of stability is unprecedented .
Thus , IxB- « 832/36A offers proof-of-principle that artifactually gained functions , when used to attenuate the replication of live HIV-1 , can be stable .
These findings illustrate gain-of-function as a feasible strategy for developing safer live-attenuated HIVs to be tested as candidates for AIDS vaccine .

In fact , in the SIV model of AIDS , viruses deleted of accessory genes , such as nef , are attenuated and confer immune protection in adults ( 1-6 ) .
Recent results have raised concerns about the safety of such live-attenuated viruses because of the emergence of virulent mutants ( 7-11 ) .
Hence , it is reasonable that new mechanistically distinct strategies should be considered in combination with loss-of-function to develop safe live-attenuated vaccine candidates .
Stable attenuation of lentivirus is difficult .
Reasons for this include the high mutability of retroviruses as a consequence of poor fidelity in reverse transcription and high rates of viral replication .
Virus replication is one of several parameters used to measure HIV disease progres-sion .
To this end , endowing the viral genome with an inhibitory function that represses replication is , in principle , a valid strategy for attenuation .
AIDS pathogenesis involves complex host-pathogen interactions ( 12-17 ) .
HIV-1 entry occurs through binding of gp120 envelope glycoprotein to CD4 and chemokine co-receptors ( 18 , 19 ) .
Later , after reverse transcription and integration , regulated HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on cellular transcription factors and on the viral Tat protein acting through several cis regulatory sequences in the HIV-1 LTR ( 20 , 21 ) .
Prominent among these sequences are two NF- « B sites located upstream of the Sp1-TATAA motif ( 22 ) and a third NF-KB site co-incident with the TAR sequence ( 23 ) .
The prevalence of NF- « B sites in all HIV isolates ( 24 ) suggests that NF-kB function is fundamentally important for virus replication and represents an attractive target to attenuate HIVs .
NF- « B is regulated by IB inhibitors ( 25 ) .
In response to activating stimuli , IB proteins become phosphorylated , ubiquinated , and degraded by protea-somes .
This releases active NF- « B complexes leading to tran-scriptional activation of responsive genes .
An IkB-a mutant protein , ( defective for serine 32- and serine 36-phosphorylation ) , was previously shown to resist proteolysis ( 26 , 27 ) .
IxB-e832/36A was found to be a particularly potent inhibitor of NF- « B-dependent gene transcription ( 26 , 27 ) .
Based on the role of NF-KB in virus transcription , we reasoned that expression of I « B- « 832/36A could be one way to attenuate HIV-1 .
Here , we have investigated the feasibility of a stable bimodal attenuation of HIV-1 through both gain- and loss-of-function .

30 _ 21.5 _ We show that a proteolysis-resistant dominant negative IkB-a molecule ( IxB-a832/36A ) can be inserted into nef of HIV-1 , is maintained in the viral genome despite prolonged passaging in tissue culture , and contributes to a strong attenuation of HIV-1 .
These results indicate that gain-of-function should be considered together with loss-of-function in strategies for constructing safe live-attenuated HIV-1 vaccine candidates .
In addition , they demonstrate that NF- « B inhibition is a major target for HIV-1 attenuation .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Construction of IxB-a Recombinant HIV-1 Viruses-pNLAnef was generated by replacing the first 117 nucleotides of nef sequence of pNL4-38 ( 28 ) with a linker specifying for the unique restriction sites Xhol , Xbal , and NotI .
This resulted in the frameshift of the remaining nef sequence .
cDNAs for IxB- @ and IxB-a882/86A were amplified by PCR using a 5'-primer flanked by Soil site and a 3'-primer flanked by the FLAG sequence followed by stop codon and Xbal site .
The 5'-primer was 5'-ACGCGTCGACATGTTCCAGGCGGCCGAGCGC-3 ' ; the 3'-primer was 5'-GCTCTAGATCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCT-AACGTCAGACGCTGGCCTCCAAA-3 ' .
The PCR products for IxB-a and IxB- @ 882/36A were digested with Sail and Xbal and ligated into pNLAnef to generate pNLIkB-wt and pNLIxB-M , respectively .
I « B-was also cloned in antisense orientation using a 5'-primer flanked by Xbal site and a 3'-primer flanked by Sail site to generate pNLIxB-as .

RESULTS HIV-1 Expressing IxB- « 832/36A Down-regulates Viral Ex pression-To determine whether the attenuation of HIV-1 could be obtained via cis-expression of a proteolysis-resistant inhibitor of NF- « B , FLAG-tagged cDNA was positioned in sense and antisense orientations into nef of HIV-1 pNL4-3 generating pNLI « B-M and pNLIxB-as genomes , respectively ( Fig .
14 ) .
As a control , an otherwise isogenic molecular clone of pNL4-3 expressing the proteolysis-sensitive wild-type I « xB- « cDNA was also constructed ( Fig .
14 ) .
These insertions also resulted in the deletion of 39 amino acids from the N terminus of Nef and a translational frameshift for the remaining Nef-encoding codons .
Hence , the chimeric genomes gained an I « B- « 832/36A function coupled with a simultaneous loss of Nef function .
From these molecular genomes , different virus stocks were generated through independent transfections of 293T cells .
Expression in the transfected cells of HIV-1 proteins and the heterologous I « B-cDNAs was verified by immunoblotting ( Fig .
1 , B and C ) .
To assess the functional impact of IxB- @ 832/36A in the context of HIV-1 gene expres-sion , viral transcription in 293T cells transfected individually 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 17570 with pNL4-3 , pNLAnef , pNLIxB-M , pNLIkB-as , or pNLI « B-wt was analyzed by RNase protection assays .
Viral RNAs were efficiently produced from all genomes except for the I « B- « 832¥/ 36A-expressing virus , pNLI « B-M ( Fig .
24 ) .
This finding points to a strong inhibition of LTR-directed transcription by « 832/36A .
A normalized simultaneous co-transfection into cells of genome with pNL4-3 genome fused to the Zucif-erase reporter gene still resulted in markedly reduced viral transcription ( Fig .
2B ) .
The inhibitory mechanism is likely to be a dominant trans-repressive effect from the I « B- « 832/36A protein rather than a cis-destabilizing phenomenon arising as a consequence of an insertion into nef .

HIV-1 Attenuation by Gain of IxB- « 832/36A Function by the fact that the insertion of I « B-a cDNA either in antisense orientation , or as wild-type sequence does not inhibit viral expression ( Fig .
24 , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Repressed expression would have been expected if there were a cis insertional effect .
Attenuation of HIV-1 Expressing IxB- « 832/36A-Next , the replication properties of the recombinant HIV-1 genomes were measured .
We monitored for viral growths in established ( Ju-rkat ) and primary ( PBMCs ) T-cells .
Based on normalized amounts of input viruses , NLI « B-M was found to be highly attenuated in Jurkat cells when compared with the NLAnef and ( Fig .
34 ) .
A reduced replication capacity was also observed for NLI « B-M in human PBMCs stimulated either with anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 ( Fig .
3B ) or PHA ( Fig .
3C ) .
In par-allel , the chimeric HIV-1 which expresses the proteolysis-sensitive wild-type IxB-a produced a replication profile that was only slightly attenuated when compared with control virus ( Fig .
4 , A-C ) .
Taken together , these results indicate a critical contribution of proteolysis-resistant mutant I « B-a « toward attenuated viral growth .
Attenuation of NLIxB-M Is Not Because of Apoptosis-Previ-ously , IxB- « 832/36A was shown to enhance the apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor- « ( 30-32 ) .
Because tumor necrosis factor-a is produced during HIV-1 infection ( 33 , 34 ) , we asked whether a pro-apoptotic effect of IxB-a832/36A might account , in part , for attenuation of viral growth .
To this end , Jurkat cells infected separately with NL4-3 , NLIKB-M , or NLI « B-as viruses were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of p24 and for binding to annexin V , a marker of an early event in apoptosis ( 35 ) .
Because of the different viral growth kinetics , to account fully for equivalent levels of virus production , cell samples were analyzed at variant times post-infection .
As shown in Table I , the percentage of apoptotic cells among p24-positive population was 17 and 13 % for NL4-3 and respectively , at day 10 post-infection , as compared with 19 % for NLIxB-M at day 18 post-infection .
Thus , the expression of IxBaS32/36A did not affect apoptosis significantly because the percentage of apoptotic cells among those infected with NL4-3 , NLI « B-as , or NLI « B-M was similar .
NLIxB-M Is Stably Attenuated through Cell Passaging-Retroviruses rapidly delete heterologous genes which do not confer benefits for replication ( 36-38 ) .
One indication of such a loss in gained function would be a change in the kinetics of replication in later ( compared with earlier ) passages of viruses .
In examining NLIxB-M virus after prolonged culturing in cells , we noted that its attenuated phenotype bred true despite extended re-passaging ( Fig .
5 , A-C ) .
No changes in replication phenotype were observed with up to 180 days ( 9 passages ) of continuously forced propagation in ex vivo tissue cultures .

To verify biochemically that this phenotypic stability was from the maintenance of I « B- « 832/36A in nef , RT-PCR analysis of virion RNAs was performed using samples isolated after various times of culturing in Jurkat cells ( Fig .
5D ) .
Viral RNAs from first passage ( 20 days in culture ) as compared with sixth ( 120 days in culture ) and ninth ( 180 days in culture ) passage were indistinguishable , providing no evidence for deletion of I « B-a832/836A ( Fig .
5D , compare lanes 5-7 ) .
Thus , by contrast with other cDNAs inserted into nef ( 36-38 ) in the setting of replicating HIV-1/SIV , I « xB- « 832/36A is unprecedently stable .
DISCUSSION Various approaches have been proposed for generating live-attenuated HIV-1 ( 39 ) .
Based on findings from the SIV model of 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 AIDS , loss-of-function ( e.g .
deletion of accessory genes such as nef , vpr , and U3 ) has been forwarded as a primary approach for creating enfeebled , but replication-competent , HIV/SIV ( 1-6 ) .
Regrettably , recent evidence indicates that loss-of-function alone is not always sufficient ( and is perhaps largely insuffi-cient ) to prevent virulence ( 7-11 ) .
Hence , one is faced with either abandoning live-attenuated virus as a potential route for HIV-1 vaccine or devising another approach which is mechanistically distinct from and could be used additively with loss-of-function in attenuating the AIDS virus .
Attenuation of HIV-1 by gain-of-function was first broached four years ago ( 40 ) .
However , an issue that has impeded the useful application of gain-of-function is uncertainty over the stability of functions added to a replicating HIV-1 genome .
To date , all exogenous 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 17572 open-reading frames , such as thymidine kinase , y-interferon , interleukin-2 ( 36-38 ) , when artifactually embedded into the HIV-1/SIV genome have been unstable to prolonged ex vivo passaging , suggesting a rule of rapid deletion of gained genes upon virus replication .
However , because the sampling size for gained functions has been small , it remains unclear whether this is indeed a universal rule .
Our findings from I « B- « 832/36A formally challenge the rigidity of this rule .
An ability by viruses in general and by HIV-1 specifically to maintain stably gained functions should not be inherently sur-prising .
For example , piracy of large numbers of cellular genes by herpesviruses has been well documented ( see Ref .
41 and references cited therein ) .
In simple animal retroviruses , only Gag , Pol , and Env open-reading frames are required for virus propagation .
Hence , the evolution of fat , rev , nef , upu , vif , and upr in the existing HIV-1 genome represents likely illustrations of how this virus has anciently through natural means acquired and continues to maintain stably added reading frames .
Conceivably , IxB-a832/36A has certain cellular characteristics that benefit the virus-cell interaction during HIV-1 replication .
What might be the propitious characteristics specified by IkB-a832/36A await further investigation .
It is possible that the inhibition of virus transcription by IxB- @ 832/36A allows the cell to survive HIV-1 infection , while cell killing occurs in the case of recombinant viruses that carry exogenous genes which do not confer virus attenuation .
A second possible explanation for the insert stability in NLIxB-M is that IxB-a832/36A could provide an `` anti-mutator '' effect to the chimeric HIV-1 genome .
This `` anti-mutator '' effect would confer a relative resistance to the deletion of the gained function .
In this regard , the expression of a dominant negative IxB-a « has been shown to correct aberrant DNA synthesis which causes genetic instability in ataxia telangectasia cells ( 42 ) .
In conclusion , we demonstrate here the feasibility of a gain-of-function strategy for stably attenuating live HIV-1 .
Specifi-cally , we show that the addition of IxB-a832/36A to an HIV-1 genome conferred a highly attenuated replication phenotype that is genetically stable for a minimum of 180 days of growth in tissue culture .
Attenuated replication in ex vivo tissue culture is by no means a perfect predictor of in vivo viral robust-ness ; however , the unprecedented observation that emerges from I « kB- « 832/36A is its durability in settings where other artifactually gained open-reading frames ( 36-38 ) have failed .
An important extension to the experiments here would be to explore the in vivo stability of IxB- « 832/36A in chimeric SIVs propagated in macaques .
However , the fact that transcription from the SIV LTR is not ruled by NF- « B in the same manner as that from the HIV-1 LTR ( 43-45 ) undermines the feasibility of such a heterologous in vivo test for IxB- « 832/36A .
In this regard , further studies on SIV LTR-driven transcription are warranted to identify analogous cellular inhibitors of SIV replication .
That not withstanding , the findings from I « B-a832/ 36A represent a first-step proof that gain-of-function could be a stably useful approach for attenuation .
This first step should spur further stepwise exploration for other useful attenuating markers that might be more amenable to incremental testing in nonhuman primate models .
If so , a combination approach that incorporates gain-of-function with loss-of-function could possibly contribute toward the development of a live-attenuated HIV-1 vaccine .
