HEMATOPOIESIS Genetic Evidence for an Additional Factor Required for Erythropoietin-Induced Signal Transduction By Sarah L. Gaffen , Stephen Y. Lai , Gregory D. Longmore , Kathleen D. Liu , and Mark A. Goldsmith Erythropoietin ( EPO ) and its receptor ( EPOR ) are required for the development of mature erythrocytes .
After binding of ligand , the EPOR activates a variety of signaling pathways that ultimately control cellular proliferation , survival , and specific gene expression .
Although erythroid progenitors appear to be the principal EPO-responsive cell type in vivo due to the restricted expression of the EPOR , many growth factor-dependent cell lines expressing the EPOR can respond to EPO by activating many or all of these pathways .
In the present study , we have identified a cellular context ( the interleukin-2 [ IL-2 ] -dependent HT-2 line ) in which the EPO stimulation of the EPOR fails to support cellular proliferation , AMMALIAN BLOOD CELL differentiation depends on cellular proliferation and crucial cell-fate decisions that are coordinated by a family of hematopoietic cytokines , particularly erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
EPO , a 34-kD cytokine , is produced by the kidney under conditions of low oxygen tension and acts on erythroid progenitors via a specific erythropoietin receptor ( EPOR ) . !
EPO plays a critical role in mammalian hematopoi-esis , because it is required for the development of mature erythrocytes , and animals deficient in this cytokine or its receptor die early in fetal development due to severe anemia . ''
In addition , EPO is used extensively in the clinic to treat anemia associated with EPO deficiency without serious side effects .
Numerous signaling molecules and pathways have been linked to the EPOR , the combined effects of which generally include cellular survival and/or proliferation , differentiation , and specific gene expression , ultimately leading to erythroid maturation and expansion of the red blood cell compartment .

Interestingly , when we fused HT-2 cells expressing the EPOR with Ba/ F3 cells in a complementation assay , the resulting hybridomas proliferated and potently activated STAT-5 and MAPK in response to EPO .
These data indicate that an unidentified cellular factor is needed to mediate signaling by the EPOR .
Moreover , Ba/ F3 cells apparently express this factor ( s ) and somatic fusions can , therefore , confer EPO-responsiveness to HT-2 cells that lack this factor .

members of which are characterized by conserved structural motifs in the extracellular domain including four conserved cysteine residues and a membrane-proximal WSXWS motif . ''
Like other members of this family , the cytoplasmic tail of the EPOR contains no known enzymatic activity , but instead associates with various second messenger molecules to effect signal transduction .
EPO stimulation is thought to trigger homodimerization of EPOR subunits , initiating a cascade of signal transduction events .
Interestingly , a mutation within the EPOR extracellular region of cysteine for arginine-129 results in constitutive dimerization through a disulfide bridge between receptor subunits that causes ligand-independent signaling .
In addition , synthetic peptide dimers that cause dimerization of the EPOR function similarly to EPO , and crystal structures of the EPOR co-complexed with these peptides show that the receptor adapts a symmetrical twofold dimer configuration . ''
Homodimerization of the receptor results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of intracellular substrates , including the EPOR itself . '' ''
Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and many of its associated signaling molecules is mediated by the Janus kinase JAK2 , which associates constitutively with EPOR monomeric subunits and is activated upon ligand binding by autophosphorylation .
'* One consequence of JAK2 activation is the recruitment of the SH2-domain-containing transcription factors STAT-5A and This recruitment leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-5A/5B and dimerization via reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosyl interactions , followed by rapid nuclear import of STAT-5 dimers , resulting in transcription of EPO-responsive genes such as oncostatin-M ' '' and the signaling inhibitor CIS .
' 8 Studies using dominant negative STAT-5 mutants or EPOR mutants defective in STAT-S5-association domains have linked the activation of STAT-5 to cellular proliferation and/or differentiation in certain cultured cell lines. ! ''
However , mice deficient in STAT-5A , STAT-5B , or both exhibit normal erythropoiesis , '' indicating that STAT-5 is not essential for EPOR function in vivo .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor also leads to the recruitment of other SH2-containing proteins such as Shc , PI3K , SHIP , Vav , and PLCy , and the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2.4 '' ° Therefore , the EPOR activates a striking array of signaling pathways that are characteristic of the cytokine receptor superfamily and act in concert to coordinate the physiological effects of this cytokine .

ADDITIONAL FACTOR NEEDED FOR EPOR SIGNALING The study of cytokine signaling pathways has been aided greatly by the availability of cytokine-dependent cell lines .
For example , in the interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) -dependent cell lines 32D ( pro-myeloid ) and Ba/F3 ( pro-B ) , ectopic expression of the EPOR allows growth in EPO in place of IL-3 .
Similarly , transfection of the IL-2RfB chain into these cell lines renders them responsive to IL-2 . ''
These cell lines have been valuable in molecular mapping studies of the EPOR , allowing specific signaling events to be linked to particular subdomains of the EPOR cytoplasmic tail .
In addition , such studies suggest that there is tremendous overlap in the array of signals used by various cytokine receptors .
For example , in the 32D and Ba/F3 cell lines , the EPOR , IL-2R , and IL-3R complexes all activate JAKs , STAT-5A/B , the MAPK cascade , c-fos gene expression/ DNA binding , be/-2 and be/-x ; gene expression , and inhibit apoptosis .
The present report describes a cell line in which signaling through the EPOR is markedly but selectively impaired , while signaling through the IL-2R is intact .
Although the EPOR can activate JAK2 and exert a potent anti-apoptotic effect in this cellular background , it fails to activate STAT-5 or MAPK , or to support EPO-dependent proliferation , despite the ability of the IL-2R to engage these pathways efficiently .
Genetic complementation by somatic fusion to permissive cells rescues signaling , indicating that a missing factor ( s ) can be provided in frans to restore full EPOR function .
Thus , this cell line provides a valuable system in which to identify previously unrecognized components of the EPOR signaling pathway .

RESULTS The EPOR inhibits apoptosis in HT-2 cells .
To examine the function of the EPOR in an IL-2-responsive cell , stable HT-2 cell lines were generated that expressed the EPOR ( designated HT-2.EPOR.3* ) , and mRNA expression was confirmed by Northern blotting ( Fig 1A ) .
It has been shown that the EPOR serves to inhibit apoptosis in erythroid progenitors , '' and several cytokines inhibit apoptosis in HT-2 cells.4 Therefore , we examined the ability of the EPOR to inhibit apoptosis induced by IL-2 withdrawal by incubating cells for 40 hours without cytokine , with IL-2 or with EPO .
Cells were then stained with propidium iodide ( PI ) and Annexin V coupled to green fluorescent protein ( Annexin-GFP ) * and analyzed by flow cytometry .
First , PI staining was used to measure cell death .
Incubation of HT-2 or HT-2.EPOR.3 cells without cytokines resulted in significant cell death , because only 25.2 % or 14.2 % of HT-2 or HT-2.EPOR.3 cells excluded PI , respec-tively , in a typical experiment ( Fig 1B ) .
The slight differences in cell death among cell lines represent experimental variation , because they were not consistently observed over multiple experiments .
However , signaling through the EPOR dramatically and reproducibly protected HT-2.EPOR.3 cells from death in the presence of EPO , as 62.1 % of cells excluded PI , compared with 27.3 % of the parental HT-2 cells lacking the EPOR .
Finally , IL-2 signaling prevented cell death in both cell lines ( 94.8 % of HT-2 and 83.2 % of HT-2.EPOR.3 cells were PI-negative ) .
Thus , stimulation by EPO conferred cell survival on EPOR-expressing HT-2 cells , although the protection was not as complete as that observed when cells were incubated with IL-2 .
To determine whether the EPOR was inhibiting apoptosis per se , the Pl-negative populations were examined for staining by Annexin-GFP , which binds to phosphatidylserine and serves as a marker of apoptosis ( Fig 1B ) .
Virtually all HT-2 and HT-2.EPOR.3 cells incubated without cytokine that were still alive ( ie , Pl-negative ) bound to Annexin-GFP ( 96.7 % of HT-2 and 92.2 % of HT-2.EPOR.3 cells ) , indicating that they were apoptotic .
Similarly , 93.1 % of PI-negative HT-2 cells ( that did not express the EPOR ) were Annexin-GFP-positive in the presence of EPO , indicating that the entire culture was undergoing apoptosis .
In contrast , HT-2.EPOR.3 cells showed signifi-cant , EPO-dependent protection from apoptosis , because only 10.2 % of the cells stained positively with Annexin-GFP in the GAFFEN ET AL presence of EPO .
As expected , IL-2 treatment strongly protected both cell lines from apoptosis ( 6.2 % of HT-2 and 3.7 % of HT-2.EPOR.3 cells were Annexin-GFP-positive ) .
In addition , the anti-apoptotic effect of EPO occurred in a dose-responsive fashion , with detectable inhibition of apoptosis and a corresponding increase in percentage of live cells evident at concentrations of EPO as low as 0.2 U/mL ( Fig 1C ) .
These data show that the EPOR prevents HT-2.EPOR.3 cell death upon cytokine withdrawal by delivering a potent anti-apoptotic signal .
EPOR alone fails to support proliferation in HT-2 cells .
The ability of the EPOR to mediate growth signaling in the HT-2 cell background was evaluated by measuring incorporation of [ °H ] thymidine in cells incubated in either IL-2 or EPO .
As a positive control , HT-2 cells expressing chimeric receptors in which the cytoplasmic domain of the EPOR was replaced with the cytoplasmic tails of either the IL-2RfB or yc chains ( EPOR® and EPOy ) responded vigorously to EPO after 24 hours of stimulation ( Fig In contrast , parental HT-2 cells failed to incorporate significant levels of [ H ] thymidine in response to EPO .
Strikingly , HT-2.EPOR.3 cells did not incorporate high levels of although there was a small but reproducible signal that peaked at approximately 8 % of IL-2 levels in very high doses of EPO ( Fig 2A ) .
However , EPO failed entirely to sustain growth of HT-2.EPOR.3 cells in the absence of IL-2 ( data not shown ) .
Thus , EPO triggers a minimal but transient proliferative response in HT-2 cells that is greatly reduced compared to that induced by IL-2 .
To confirm that the EPOR cDNA used in these experiments encodes a functional receptor that supports cell growth in an permissive cellular background , the EPOR was expressed stably in the IL-3-dependent myeloid cell line , 32D.4 In contrast to HT-2 cells , 32D.EPOR cells exhibited a vigorous proliferative dose response to EPO , while the parental 32D line lacking the EPOR failed to proliferate ( Fig 2B ) .
Together with the anti-apoptotic effect described earlier , these data show that inhibition of apoptosis and induction of proliferation are separable signaling events .
Finally , to verify that the HT-2.EPOR.3 cells express potentially functional EPO receptors , the EPORB chimeric receptor was transiently transfected into HT-2.EPOR.3 cells , and [ *H ] thy-midine incorporation was measured over a 16-day period .
We have previously reported that , although the EPORB receptor alone is not sufficient to support growth signaling , it can signal proliferation when paired with either the EPOy chimera or with a truncated EPOR retaining the JAK2-binding domain [ EPOR ( 1-321 ) ° '' ] .
EPOR also exhibited a characteristically potent proliferative response to EPO when paired with the full-length EPOR in HT-2.EPOR.3 cells , whereas a control vector alone failed to induce [ *HJthymidine incorporation ( Fig 2C ) .
Thus , these experiments show that the HT-2 cell line is restricted in its ability to respond to cytokines : while the IL-2R ( or EPOB/ EPOy chimeras ) delivers effective growth signals to these cells , the EPOR is insufficient to promote proliferation or long-term survival in EPO .
The EPOR fails to activate STAT factors in HT-2 cells .
A dominant pathway activated by cytokine receptors is the JAK-STAT pathway , and EPOR-derived proliferation signaling has been linked to JAK2 and STAT-5 activation in some settings .

- EPO signaling mediates phosphorylation of JAK2 and the EPOR but not STAT-5 in HT-2 cells .
( A ) HT-2.EPOR.3 cells were rested and stimulated with no cytokine ( U ) , 50 U/mL EPO ( E ) , or 10 nmol/L IL-2 ( 2 ) and lysates were immunoprecipitated with 5 g of antibodies to JAK1 ( lanes 1 through 3 ) , JAK2 ( lanes 4 through 6 ) , or JAK3 ( lanes 7 through 9 ) .
Immunoprecipitates were separated on 8.75 % SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies .
Migration of molecular-weight markers is indicated .
The presence of a small amount of phosphorylated JAK3 in lanes 7 and 8 is probably background phosphorylation resulting from incomplete IL-2 deprivation of the cells before restimulation with the indicated cytokines .
( B ) HT-2.EPOR.3 and 371.2 cells were rested and stimulated for 15 minutes with no cytokine ( U ) , 50 U/mL EPO ( E ) , 10 nmol/L IL-2 ( 2 ) , or 10 % WEHI-CM ( IL-3 ) ( 3 ) and nuclear extracts were prepared .
EMSAs were performed with 10 pg of nuclear extracts and a `` P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the FeyRI STAT-response element . '' ''
Supershifts were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts with anti-STAT-5A and -5B antisera ( lane 4 ) or preimmune rabbit sera ( lane 5 ) for 45 minutes before the EMSA reaction .
( C ) HT-2.EPOR.3 cells were rested and stimulated with no cytokine ( U ) , EPO ( E ) , or IL-2 ( 2 ) and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to STAT-5A and -5B .
Immunoprecipitates were separated on 8.75 % SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies .
The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT-5A and -5B antibodies .

80 transferred to nitrocellulose , and probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies ( Fig 3D ) .
In both HT-2EPOR.3 cells and control 371.2.EPOR cells , EPO stimulation resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of the EPOR ( Fig 3D , lanes 2 and 4 ) , indicating that the defect in signaling is not attributable to impairment of this proximal step .
The EPOR fails to activate the MAPK cascade or specific gene expression in HT-2 cells .
- To characterize other signaling pathways known to be induced by the EPOR in permissive cells , the ability of EPO to induce phosphorylation of MAPK on serine residues was examined .
Cells were starved and stimulated with cytokine , and lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to phosphorylated MAPK .
The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction , separated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and probed with antibodies to a phosphorylated sub-strate , Elk1 .
EPO stimulation of a positive control cell line HCD57 ( a murine , EPO-dependent erythroleukemia cell line ) induced MAPK phosphorylation of its substrate ( Fig 4 , lane 1 ) .
However , in HT-2.EPOR.3 cells , EPO stimulation failed to activate MAPK , while IL-2 stimulation resulted in efficient MAPK induction ( Fig 4 , lanes 4 and 6 ) .
Another common consequence of MAPK activation is the induction of specific gene expression , including the proto-oncogene c-fos . ''
To assay c-fos gene expression , cells were starved of cytokine and stimulated with EPO or IL-2 for the indicated time periods .
Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from these cells , separated on denaturing agarose gels , transferred to membranes , and probed for c-fos or GAPD ( Fig 5A ) .
Parental HT-2 cells lacking the EPOR failed to induce c-fos gene expression ( Fig 5A , lanes 1 through 4 ) , while IL-2 stimulation resulted in marked c-fos mRNA induction which peaked at 30 to 60 minutes , as described previously ( Fig 5A , lanes 5 through HCD57 HT-2.EPOR.3 E U U E 4 2 - 202 - 137 - 79 a # a # Tw C « meam - 42 - 31 unem- 1 2 3 4 5 6 Fig 4 .

HCDS7 cells ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or HT-2.EPOR.3 cells ( lanes 3 through 6 ) were starved and stimulated with no cytokine ( U ) , 50 U/ mL EPO ( E ) , 10 ng/ mL murine IL-4 ( 4 ) , or 10 nmol/ L IL-2 ( 2 ) .
Total cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphoMAPK anti-body .
Immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays with an Elk1-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein , separated by 10 % SDS-PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and probed with anti-phospho-Elk1 antibodies .

As expected , EPO stimulation of HT-2EPOBy cells also induced c-fos mRNA ( Fig 5A , lanes 14 through 17 ) , but EPO stimulation of HT-2.EPOR.3 cells failed to induce detectable c-fos gene expression ( Fig 5A , lanes 9 through 13 ) .
As c-fos gene expression is considered typically to be a consequence of MAPK signaling , this result is consistent with the lack of MAPK activation by EPO in HT-2.EPOR.3 cells ( Fig 4 ) .
We likewise examined whether the anti-apoptotic gene bei-2 is induced by EPO in HT-2.EPOR.3 cells .
However , despite the potent anti-apoptotic effect of EPOR seen in Fig 1 , be/-2 mRNA was only weakly induced upon EPO stimulation ( Fig 5A , lane 13 ) , although IL-2 induced a strong upregulation of be/-2 transcripts in HT-2 cells ( Fig 5A , lane 8 ) and EPO induced be/-2 mRNA in HT-2.EPORBy cells ( Fig 5A , lane 17 ) .
This experiment suggests that the anti-apoptotic effect of EPOR probably occurs via a pathway independent of Bel-2 .
Recent evidence has also implicated the Bel-2 family member Bel-x1 , in anti-apoptotic effects mediated by the EPOR .

Somatic hybrids between HT-2 and Ba/F3 cells rescue EPO signaling .
- To determine whether the defect in EPOR signaling in HT-2 cells could be overcome by genetic complementation , we generated a series of stable hybridoma cell lines between HT-2.EPOR.3 and Ba/F3 , a cell line lacking EPOR expression .
Cells were cocultured , fused with various concentrations of PEG , and selected for growth in 50 U/mL EPO .
Notably , when the fusion protocol was performed with either HT-2.EPOR.3 or Ba/F3 cells alone , no cell lines whatsoever survived selection in EPO .
However , EPO-dependent fusion lines were readily generated when HT-2.EPOR.3 and Ba/F3 cells were mixed in the fusion reaction .
Two polyclonal fusion lines were chosen for further analysis , designated HB40 and HB55 ( for HT-2-Ba/F3 fused at 40 % or 55 % PEG ) .
Both HB40 and HB5S5 cells proliferated vigorously in response to EPO , while Ba/F3 and HT-2.EPOR.3 cells showed little or no response ( Fig 6A ) .
The abilities of HB40 and HB55 to proliferate were directly dependent on the dose of EPO , and these cells responded to physiological doses of EPO ( Fig 6B ) .
Moreover , ' '' I-EPO binding analyses showed that the fusion cell lines expressed approximately the same number of surface EPO receptors with similar affinities as the parental HT-2.EPOR.3 cells ( Table 1 ) .
Both the HT-2.EPOR.3 cells and the HB40 and HB55 cells expressed 200 to 250 cell-surface EPO receptors , with affinities in the range of 1,500 to 1,800 pmol/L , whereas the parental HT-2 cells did not express detectable receptors for EPO ( Table 1 ) .
These results indicate that restoration of signaling in the fusion cell lines is not simply caused by an increase in receptor number .
We next examined STAT-5 activation by the fusion cell lines .
In contrast to HT-2.EPOR.3 cells , HB40 and HB55 cells activated STAT-5 DNA binding activity vigorously in response to EPO ( Fig 6C ) .
In addition , phosphorylation of STAT-5 proteins in response to EPO was also restored in the fusion lines ( Fig 6D ) .
Thus , Ba/F3 cells are able to complement the EPOR signaling defect of HT-2 cells .
Furthermore , rescuing the cells ' ability to grow in EPO correlates with concurrent restoration of STAT-5 activation , which suggests that the missing compo- From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Finally , to determine whether the MAPK/c-Fos pathway is likewise rescued in the fusion cell lines , we measured induction of c-fos mRNA .
Cells were starved of cytokines , stimulated for various times with EPO , and mRNA and Northern blots were prepared and probed with P-labeled c-fos and GAPD probes .
Induction of c-fos mRNA by EPO was indeed evident in these cell lines ( Fig 6E , lanes 7 and 11 ) .
Thus , all aspects of EPOR signaling measured were reconstituted in the fusion cell lines HB40 and HB55 .
DISCUSSION This study shows that the EPOR fails to mediate STAT-5 and MAPK activation or to deliver proliferative signals in the IL-2-dependent T-cell line , HT-2 , despite the presence of potentially functional cell-surface EPO receptors that can mediate JAK2 and EPOR phosphorylation and inhibit apoptosis .
The signaling defect ( s ) can be complemented by somatic hybridization between HT-2.EPOR cells and IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells , suggesting that a missing factor required for signaling in HT-2 cells can be provided in trans by Ba/F3 cells .
These results delineate a dichotomy between the signaling incubated in media without grow th factors for 15 hours and stimulated with no cytokine ( U , lanes 1 , 5 , and 14 ) 50 U/mL EPO ( lanes 2 through 4 , 9 through 13 , 15 through 17 ) or 10 nmol/L IL-2 ( lanes 6 through 8 ) for the indicated time periods .

processes that drive anti-apoptosis and those that induce proliferation .
In addition , they provide a valuable platform for identifying new components of the EPOR signaling cascade , which may also yield further insights into signaling mechanisms by other cytokine receptors .
Cytokines regulate a myriad of physiological processes within their target cells , including proliferation , survival , and differentiation .
Other studies have suggested that the mechanisms that promote cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis are distinct from those that trigger cellular proliferation . ''
The HT-2.EPOR.3 cell line described here supports this separation of function , as the EPOR delivers a strong anti-apoptotic signal while failing to induce proliferation .
The immature erythroid cell line J2E-NR exhibits similar characteristics with respect to proliferation ; while the EPOR fails to induce growth signaling or differentiation in these cells , it does serve to enhance cell viability . ''
However , in many other cytokine-dependent cells , the EPOR supports proliferative signaling ( eg , 32D cells , Fig 2B ) .
These results may indicate that certain cell types need only an anti-apoptotic signal to transit the cell cycle and proliferate , while HT-2 cells require an additional impetus to proliferation that apparently can be provided by the IL-2R but not by diverse cytokine receptors such as the EPOR ( this study ) , IL-7R , '' ° From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

cells , thus arguing that STAT-5 is not involved in this particular anti-apoptotic pathway .
Likewise , despite evidence that induction of the API transcription factor ( which includes the c-Fos proto-oncogene ) by the MAPK pathway has been linked to protection from apoptosis , '' it is clear that MAPK activation is not required for inhibition of apoptosis in the HT-2 cell background , because this pathway is not engaged by the EPOR .
In 32D cells , the EPOR is known to induce Bcl-2 and Bel-x ; , to effect apoptosis inhibition.© '' However , neither of these genes is significantly induced by the EPOR in HT-2 cells ( Fig 5 ) .
Therefore , the molecular mechanism underlying EPOR-mediated apoptotic inhibition in this context is distinct from recognized pathways and remains to be elucidated .
In vivo , some developmental events appear to require cytokines mainly to prevent apoptosis , while others appear to need additional proliferative signals . '' ''
Although the EPOR does exert anti-apoptotic effects *** ( Fig 1 ) , prevention of apoptosis in erythroid progenitors is probably not sufficient to eliminate their dependence on EPO for maturation . ''
Specifically , in mice expressing a be/-2 transgene under the control of an erythroid promoter , growth of erythroid progenitors in vitro is impaired in the absence of EPO .
While apoptosis of colony forming units-erythroid ( CFU-E ) is delayed in these transgenic mice , no spontaneously differentiating colonies are found in the absence of EPO .
It will be interesting to see the results of crossing these mice with EPO-~- or EPOR~~- mice '' to determine whether differentiation in vivo is equally affected .
However , using a beil-2 transgene to inhibit apoptosis in erythroid progenitors may not mimic native anti-apoptotic signaling by the EPOR , because our work shows that the EPOR is able to prevent apoptosis without inducing be/-2 mRNA significantly ( Figs 1 and 5A ) , and because Bcl-2 is apparently not expressed in erythroid progenitors . ''
Another in vivo system illustrating the importance of apoptotic inhibition is mice lacking the IL-7Ra chain ( or its partner , yc ) .4 % IL-7Ra~'~ mice are characterized by profound immu-nodeficiency , lacking mature B and T cells . ''
When these mice were crossed with animals that overexpress the human be/-2 gene , T-cell development was rescued , but not B-cell develop-ment . ''
Thus , the IL-7-derived signal necessary for T-cell maturation can be replaced solely by inhibiting apoptosis , but B-cell differentiation requires additional signals from the IL-7R .
Similarly , the EPO-EPOR system appears to require such additional signals for erythroid development .
The dominant paradigm of the JAK-STAT pathway indicates that STAT factors are recruited to the receptor complex following phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine residues .
In the case of the EPOR , this model is supported by the severe diminution in STAT-5 activation by EPO receptor mutants that lack cytoplas- 83 mic tyrosine residues .
`` `` '' * '' '' However , the block in JAK-STAT signaling in this study shows that there is likely to be an additional component of this pathway that has not been previously recognized .
Although very proximal signals are intact in this pathway ( eg , phosphorylation of JAK2 and the EPOR , Figs 3A and 3D ) , phosphorylation of STAT-5 is impaired ( Fig 3C ) despite the presence of potential phosphotyro-sine docking sites on the EPOR in these cells .
It is interesting to note that the DNA binding complexes induced by EPO in 371.2 cells migrate slightly faster than does the IL-2-induced STAT-5 complex in HT-2 cells or the EPO-induced STAT-5 complex in HB40 and HB55 cells We have not yet determined the biochemical basis for this difference .
There are two opposing hypotheses to explain the lack of EPOR signaling in the HT-2 cell line .
The most likely explanation is that the cells are missing a factor ( s ) necessary to mediate signaling .
Supporting evidence comes from the somatic fusions with Ba/F3 cells , which can complement the lack of function in HT-2.EPOR.3 cells .
The resulting fusion cell lines rescue not only proliferation signaling , but also STAT-5 activation and proto-oncogene induction .
Although the nature of this factor ( s ) can only be determined by isolating a gene from an EPO-responsive cell line that can rescue the proliferative defect , some possibilities include an additional EPOR subunit or an adapter molecule that might couple STAT-5 to JAK2 or to the EPOR .
Indeed , there have been hints that the EPOR complex might contain an additional subunit '' ; in this scenario , the missing receptor would be expressed in most cell lines but would be absent in HT-2 cells .
We are confident that the missing factor is not the adapter Shc , because IL-2 signaling through Shc that leads to MAPK and c-fos mRNA induction proceeds normally in this cell line ( Figs 4 and 5 , and refs 34 , 74 , and 75 ) .
On the other hand , it is formally possible that HT-2 cells express an overabundance of a suppressor factor that inhibits the EPOR .
Although it is known that the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 are involved in EPOR signaling , '' * '' '' mRNA levels of SHP-1 and SHP-2 in HT-2 cells are comparable to those in EPO-responsive cell lines such as HCD357 and Ba/F3 ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , it is unlikely that the cytokine inhibitors of the SOCS/CIS family '' '' are responsible , because : ( 1 ) the STAT downregulation that occurs upon SOCS activation is linked to a decrease in JAK activity , while JAK2 activation by the EPOR is retained in HT-2 cells ( Fig 3 ) ; ( 2 ) none of the SOCS family members identified so far are specific to the and IL-2 , IL-7 , and IL-9 can activate STAT-5 vigorously in HT-2 cells '' '' ; and ( 3 ) the EPOR can pair with EPORB to activate JAK2 and STAT-5* and is thus unlikely to carry any other dominant suppressor molecule ( s ) that inhibits proximal signaling within this hybrid receptor complex .
Therefore , the available evidence supports the hypothesis that HT-2 cells are missing a necessary signaling component that links the EPOR to STAT-5 , MAPK , and proliferation signaling .
An issue of considerable interest is whether cytokine signaling differs depending on cell context .
Although there are dozens of cytokines , each with a specific receptor , the downstream events that follow receptor ligation are remarkably similar among members of the cytokine receptor superfamily ; eg , both the IL-2R and EPOR activate STAT-5 , c-Fos , Bel-2 , MAPK , IRS-2 , and PI3K .

84 `` interpret '' these signals differently , or is the basis for this dichotomy simply their anatomical location ?
To address this question in the context of homodimeric receptors such as the EPOR , recent work using an in vivo differentiation system showed that the cytoplasmic tail of the EPOR can be substituted with the cytoplasmic domains of diverse cytokine receptors ( G-CSFR , c-mpl , and GHR ) yet exhibit similar signaling outcomes with regard to erythropoiesis , thus favoring the notion that cytokine signals are generally replaceable . ''
Similarly , prolactin and its receptor can substitute for the EPOR in driving differentiation of erythrocytes in vitro . ''
In an analogous study , the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-2Rf chain was found to substitute functionally for the IL-7Ra chain in driving proliferation of B cells in an ex vivo culture system .
* However , the data presented here suggest that the EPOR can not replace the IL-2R , despite the apparent similarity in the intracellular signaling molecules engaged by these receptors .
Although the restoration of STAT-5 activation in the HT-2-Ba/F3 hybridomas implies a link between STAT-5 function and proliferation , STAT-5 activation is clearly not sufficient to drive proliferation in the HT-2 cell background .
First , it has been previously shown that IL-7R signaling fails to support proliferation in HT-2 cells , despite a vigorous induction of STAT-5 DNA binding . ''
Second , the IL-9R activates STAT-5 ( and STAT-1 and STAT-3 ) quite well in HT-2 cells and also mediates an anti-apoptotic response , but does not permit proliferation . ''
Finally , the IL-4R also induces JAK-STAT activation ( in this case , STAT-6 ) without driving proliferation of HT-2 cells . ''
At present , it is unclear precisely how IL-2 signaling differs from that of the other yc-utilizing cytokine receptors and the EPOR to induce proliferation in HT-2 cells .
The failure of EPOR to signal in a T-cell background has also been described for sublines of the IL-2-dependent T-cell line CTLL transfected with the EPOR . '' ''
In this case , the cells ' nonresponsiveness was attributed to the failure of JAK2 to associate with the EPOR .
This mechanism contrasts with our results in HT-2.EPOR.3 cells in which JAK2 is potently activated in response to EPO , while STAT-5 activation is impaired .
Because IL-2 functions as a growth factor for mature , peripheral T cells such as HT-2 and CTLL , it is tempting to speculate that the lack of permissivity to signaling in the HT-2 and CTLL lines reflects their biologic origins .
It would be interesting to determine whether EPOR-mediated signal transduction can occur in normal T cells .
In conclusion , the present report describes a unique cell context in which signaling by the EPOR is impaired , despite the ability of a highly related cytokine ( IL-2 ) to trigger the same signaling pathways .
This system will serve as a valuable tool for identifying essential components that link the EPOR to the JAK-STAT , MAPK pathways , and proliferative machinery .
