Todaro , September 14 , 1992 ( received for review April 12 , 1992 ) ABSTRACT Ionizing radiation triggers a signal in human B-lymphocyte precursors that is intimately linked to an active protein-tyrosine kinase regulatory pathway .
We show that in B-lymphocyte precursors , irradiation with y-rays leads to ( # ) stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover ; ( # ) downstream activation by covalent modification of multiple serine-specific protein kinases , including protein kinase C ; and ( ii ? )
activation of nuclear factor xB .
All of the radiation-induced signals were effectively prevented by the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A .
Thus , tyrosine phosphorylation is an important and perhaps mandatory proximal step in the activation of the protein kinase C signaling cascade in human B-lymphocyte precursors .
Our report expands current knowledge of the radiation-induced signaling cascade by clarifying the chronological sequence of biochemical events that follow irradiation .
Weichselbaum and colleagues ( 1 , 2 ) have proposed that irradiation initiates a cascade of cytoplasmic signaling events in mammalian cells .
In particular , ionizing radiation stimulates the transcription of immediate early response genes that encode transcriptional factors , by activation of a protein kinase C ( PKC ) -dependent cytoplasmic signaling pathway ( 1 , 2 ) .
However , radiation-induced signaling events proximal to PKC activation require further evaluation .
Protein-tyrosine kinases ( PTK s ) are key participants in the initiation of signal cascades that affect proliferation and survival of human B-lymphocyte precursors ( 3 , 4 ) .
We have recently shown that ionizing radiation stimulates several PTKs in human B-lymphocyte precursors , including the Src family tyrosine kinases p599Y® and p55® '' * , leading to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates and triggering apoptosis ( 5 ) .
Since PTKs play myriad roles in the regulation of cell function and proliferation ( 6 , 7 ) , the activation of a PTK cascade and tyrosine phosphorylation may explain the pleiotropic effects of ionizing radiation on cellular functions .
The present study expands earlier work by specifically examining the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in radiation-induced activation of the PKC pathway in human B-lymphocyte precursors at discrete developmental stages of B-cell ontogeny .
Notably , the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin and genistein effectively inhibited radiation-induced activation of PKC ( PK76 ) and PKC-dependent serine kinases PK 55 and PK50 .
Furthermore , the activation of nuclear factor « kB ( NF-KB ) in irradiated B-lymphocyte precursors was abrogated by pretreatment with herbimycin or genistein .
Our results indicate that radiation-induced activation of the PKC The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

252 signaling cascade leads to downstream activation of multiple serine-specific protein kinases , and activation of NF- « B .
The evidence provided reveals that these events are triggered by radiation-induced stimulation of tyrosine-specific protein ki-nases .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient Material and Cell Lines .
We used the CD19+CD10+ C , sIgM- pre-pre-B cell line REH , the CD19+CD10* C sigM- pre-B cell line NALM-6 , and the CD19+CD10-C , ; sigM* early B/Burkitt lymphoma cell lines Daudi and Ramos .
The immunophenotypic and genotypic features and the radiation sensitivity of these human B-lymphocyte precursor cell lines were detailed in a previous report ( 8 ) .
All of these cell lines undergo apoptosis within 24 hr after exposure to 2-4 Gy of y-rays ( 5 , 8 ) .
We also used primary bone marrow blasts from a pre-pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient ( UPN 10 ) , following the guidelines of the University of Minnesota Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research for secondary use of pathologic or surgical tissue .
Irradiation of Cells and the Use of Kinase Inhibitors .
Cells ( 5 x 10° per ml in plastic tissue culture flasks ) were irradiated during a logarithmic growth phase and under aerobic conditions with a `` Cs irradiator ( J. L. Shephard and Assoc. , Glendale , CA , model mark I ) , as previously described ( 9 ) .
For the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ( Ins-1,4,5-P ; 3 ) assays and the serine kinase renaturation assays , cells were irradiated with 100-400 cGy at a dose rate of 99 cGy/min .
In analyses of radiation-induced activation of NF- « B , cells were irradiated with 1000-4000 cGy at a dose rate of 326 cGy/min .
Prior to irradiation , cells were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with ( a ) phosphate-buffered saline , ( b ) the PTK inhibitor genistein ( 100 ug/ml = 370 uM ; ICN ) , or ( c ) the PKC inhibitor 1- ( 5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl ) -2-methylpiperazine ( H7 , 11 ug/ml = 30 uM ; GIBCO/BRL ) , or ( d ) for 24 hr at 37°C with the benzoquinoid ansamycin antibiotic herbimycin A ( 7 pg/ml = 12 uM ; Sigma ) , which is a potent PTK inhibitor , according to published protocols ( 3 , 4 ) .
At the applied concentrations , these compounds effectively inhibit their target enzymes ( 3 , 4 ) .
Genistein competes with the ATP binding site of PTK s and inhibits their activation .
In contrast , herbimycin is not a classic competitive inhibitor of PTKs but rather targets PTKs for degradation and leads to actual loss of these proteins .
In general , herbimycin is a more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor in B-lineage lymphoid cells .
Whereas genistein usually attenuates tyrosine kinase-linked signals , herbimycin abolishes them .

cells were pretreated with B43 ( anti-CD19 ) -pokeweed antiviral protein ( PAP ) immunotoxin ( 10 ) or mafosfamid prior to radiation exposure .
Cells were treated with B43-PAP immunotoxin for 16 hr at 37°C .
Under these conditions , B43-PAP kills > 99.9 % of human B-cell precursors by an irreversible inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis ( 10 ) .
Mafosfamid ( ASTA Werke , Bielefeld , Germany ) is an in vitro-active congener of the oxazaphosphorine cyclophosphamide .
Cells were incubated with mafosfamid ( 50 ug/ml ! )
for 30 min at 37°C as described ( 10 ) .
Under these conditions , mafosfamid kills > 99.9 % of human B-cell precursors by DNA alkylation ( 10 ) .
Measurement of Ins-1,4,5-P ; Levels .
After irradiation , Ins-1,4,5-P ; levels in human B-lymphocyte precursors were measured with a highly specific o-myo- [ ' H ] Ins-1,4,5-P ; assay system ( Amersham ) , as described ( 3 , 4 ) .
This assay is based on the competition between unlabeled Ins-1,4,5-P ; and a fixed quantity of a high-specific-activity [ *H ) iIns-1,4,5-P ; tracer for a limited number of binding sites on a specific and sensitive bovine adrenal binding-protein preparation .
Renaturation Assay for Analysis of Protein-Serine Kinase Activation .
We used the kinase renaturation method of Ferrell and Martin ( 11 ) to examine the effects of ionizing radiation on the activities of renaturable serine/threonine-specific protein kinases in human B-lymphocyte precursor cells , as previously described ( 4 ) .
In some experiments , kinase renaturation assays were performed with immunoprecipitated PKC as follows .
Irradiated cells were lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer [ 150 mM NaCl/50 mM Tris CJ , pH 7.5/1 % ( vol/vol ) Nonidet P-40/1 mM Na ; VO,4 , /1 mM sodium molyb-date ] containing phenylImethanesulfonyl fluoride ( 1 mM ) , leupeptin ( 10 ug/ml ) , and aprotinin ( 10 ug/ml ) .
Nuclei were removed by centrifugation and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation of PKC with a rabbit polyclonal anti-pan PKC antibody ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) , which was generated by using a synthetic peptide corresponding to C-terminal sequences of rabbit protein kinase type BII as immunogen .
Cell lysates were incubated with anti-PKC ( final concentration , 5 ug/ml ) for 1.5 hr at 0°C .
Protein A-Sepharose ( Sigma ) was added to the lysates and incubated for 1 hr at 4°C to recover the immune complexes .
The immunoprecipitates were washed six times in immunoprecipitation buffer and then boiled for 5 min in 2x SDS sample buffer .
Samples were run in SDS/polyacryl-amide gels and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-PKC ( 1 ug/ml ) .
**5I-labeled protein A was used to detect PKC .
Kinase renaturation assays on the anti-PKC immunoprecipitates were performed as described above for whole cell lysates .
Nuclear Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility-Shift As-says .
After irradiation of cells , nuclear proteins were extracted according to published procedures ( 12 , 13 ) .
Gel shift assays were performed as described ( 13 , 14 ) .
Aliquots ( 50 ng ) of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a tandem repeat of the 11-base-pair consensus sequence for the NF- « B DNA binding site ( GGGGACTTTCC ) , which was obtained in kit form from GIBCO/BRL , were end-labeled by using [ y- > P ] JATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the recommendations of the manufacturer .
One nanogram of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide ( 400,000 cpm ) was incubated with 10 ug of nuclear protein for 20 min at room temperature in 12 wl of 25 mM Tris Cl , pH 7.6/5 mM MgCl ; /0.5 mM EDTA/1 mM dithiothreitol /10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol containing 1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Boehringer Mannheim ) .
Competition studies were performed by preincubating the nuclear protein for 15 min on ice with a 500-fold excess of unlabeled NF- « B oligonucleotide prior to the addition of the *°P-end-labeled NF- « B probe .
Controls used S500-fold excess of unlabeled AP-1 and NF-1 oligonucleotide probes for competition .

The gels were pre-run at 150 V for 2 hr at 4°C before the samples were loaded and electrophoresed for an additional 3 hr at 150 V. Gels were dried overnight and exposed at -70°C to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film with intensi- fying screens .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Role of Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Radiation-Induced Stimulation of Phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) Turnover in Human B-Lymphocyte Precursors .
Previous studies by Weichselbaum and colleagues ( 1 , 2 ) provided elegant , albeit cir-cumstantial , evidence that ionizing radiation triggers PKC activation .
PKC is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the transduction of growth-regulatory signals .
Its activation under physiologic conditions is mediated by stimulation of PitdIns-specific phospholipase C-y ( PLC-y ) ( 15 ) .
Ionizing radiation causes radiolysis of bound and solvent water in the cell , producing hydroxyl radicals , superoxide radicals , and hydrogen peroxide ( 16 , 17 ) .
Oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide can induce activation of PLC-y , leading to Ca®+ mobilization and PKC activation ( 18 , 19 ) .
The catalytic activity of PLC-y is regulated through tyrosine phosphorylation by receptor- and non-receptor-type PTKs ( 4 , 20 , 21 ) , and biochemical signals that trigger tyrosine-specific protein phosphorylation have been shown to precede the activation of PLC-y and stimulation of PtdIns turnover in many experimental systems ( 3 , 4 , 20 , 21 ) .
These findings prompted us to examine the effects of ionizing radiation on inositolphospholipid turnover in human lymphocyte precursors .
For this , we used a highly specific and quantitative p-myo- [ } HlIns-1,4,5-P ; assay system ( 3 , 4 ) .
Ionizing radiation stimulated an increase in the production of Ins-1,4,5-P ; by FL112 pro-B , REH pre-pre-B , NALM-6 pre-B , and Daudi early B cells in a dose-dependent fashion ( data not shown ) .
By comparison , treatment of these human B-lymphocyte precursor cell lines with B43 ( anti-CD19 ) -PAP immunotoxin , which kills target cells by an irreversible inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis ( 10 ) , or with the in vitro-active cyclophosphamide congener mafosfamid , which kills target cells by DNA alkylation ( 10 ) , did not stimulate PtdIns turnover .
We next examined the kinetics of radiation-induced PtdIns turnover .
Irradiation of REH pre-pre-B cells and Daudi early B cells with 200 cGy of y-rays stimulated a rapid and monophasic increase in the production of Ins-1,4,5-P ; leading to markedly elevated Ins-1,4,5-P ; levels between 30 sec and 3 min after completion of radiation exposure ( i.e. , 2.5 min and 5 min after the start of radiation exposure at a dose rate of 99 cGy/min ) .
Thereafter , the level of Ins-1,4,5-P ; rapidly declined but at 5 min it was still higher than the baseline ( Fig .
1 ) .
Taken together , these experiments provide conclusive evidence that the biochemical signal triggered in human B-lymphocyte precursors by ionizing radiation is intimately linked to signal-transduction pathways that stimulate inositolphospholipid turnover , producing Ins-1,4,5-P ; as a second messenger .
Notably , the PTK inhibitors genistein and herbimycin effectively prevented the radiation-triggered Ins-1,4,5-P ; signals , whereas H7 , a potent inhibitor of PKC and PKC-dependent serine/threonine kinases , did not .
These observations provide strong evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation is a requisite step in the radiation-triggered stimulation of PtdIns turnover in human B-lymphocyte precursors .

Magnitude and kinetics of radiation-stimulated PtdIns turnover in human B-lymphocyte precursors .
REH pre-pre-B and Daudi early B cells were irradiated in the presence or absence of the PTK inhibitors genistein ( GEN ) or herbimycin A ( HERB ) or the PKC inhibitor H7 .
Subsequently , the Ins-1,4,5-P ; levels were determined at the indicated times { 15 sec ( 15 '' ) to 5 min ( 5 ' ) ] by using a highly specific assay system ( 3 , 4 ) .
The Ins-1,4,5-P ; responses were analyzed in three independent experiments , each performed in quadruplicate .
Results are expressed as the mean pmol amounts of Ins-1,4,5-P ; per 10° cells .
Control samples were treated with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , mafosfamid , or B43-PAP immunotoxin .
found that the activation of the PLC/PKC cascade in human B-cell precursors by phorbol ester plus ionomycin or antibodies directed against sIgM , major histocompatibility complex class II , and CD40 antigens enhanced the activity of multiple serine/threonine kinases , as measured by the renaturable kinase activity toward the blocking protein substrate albumin ( 4 ) .
Activation of the PLC/PKC cascade in irradiated B-lymphocyte precursors prompted us to use this kinase renaturation method to examine the effects of ionizing radiation on the activities of serine-specific protein kinases in target cell populations .
Irradiation of Ramos early B cells and REH pre-pre-B cells enhanced within 15 min the in vitro activity of three renaturable serine/threonine-specific protein kinases of apparent molecular masses of 76 kDa ( PK76 ) , 55 kDa ( PK 55 ) , and 50 kDa ( PK50 ) ( Fig .
2 A and D ) .
Phospho amino acid analysis of the kinase bands by two-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis demonstrated that these renaturable kinases phosphorylate only serine residues ( Fig .
2B ) .
In Daudi early B cells , ionizing radiation stimulated PK76 and PK55 , while in UPN10 pre-pre-B cells , only PK76 showed enhanced activity after radiation exposure ( Fig .
2D ) .
We have previously shown that PKS5S5 and PKS50 are PKC-dependent serine kinases ( 4 ) .
Since the apparent molecular mass of the renaturable serine/threonine kinase PK76 was very similar to that of PKC ( 77 kDa ) , we postulated that PK76 may indeed be PKC .
To test this hypothesis , we immunoprecipitated PKC from whole cell lysates of unirradiated and irradiated Ramos cells with an anti-PKC antibody and examined its activity by the kinase renaturation assay .
Equal amounts of PKC were immunoprecipitated from unirradiated as well as irradiated cells , as determined by Western blot analysis of the PKC immunoprecipitates with the same anti-PKC antibody that was used for immunoprecipitation .
PKC that was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of irradiated cells showed enhanced renaturable kinase activity ( Fig .
2C ) .
These results corroborate and extend the findings of Weichselbaum and colleagues ( 1 , 2 ) and provide direct evidence that ionizing radiation stimulates PKC .
The increased renaturable kinase activity of PKC most likely results from covalent modification , since any stimulatory factors ( such as diacylglycerol ) would be separated from the PKC protein by denaturation in SDS , subsequent gel electropho-resis , and blotting .
Notably , the PTK inhibitors genistein and herbimycin effectively prevented the radiation-induced stimulation of PK76 , PK55 , and PK 50 ( Fig .
2 ) at concentrations that inhibited radiation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation .
Renaturation assays of the kinase activity in anti-PKC immunoprecipitates from unirradiated and irradiated Ramos cells showed that herbimycin could prevent the stimulation of PKC after ionizing radiation more effectively than the potent PKC inhibitor H7 ( Fig .
2 ) .
Taken together , these findings provide evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation has a fundamental role in the generation of the biochemical signal in irradiated human B-lymphocyte precursors that leads to stimulation of multiple serine-specific protein kinases , including PKC .
Role of Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Radiation-Induced Activation of in Human B-Lymphocyte Precursors .
NF- « B is an inducible transcription factor that is involved in regulation of a series of target genes ( 22 ) .
Brach et al .
( 23 ) have shown that ionizing radiation induces expression and binding activity of NF- « B in KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells by a PKC-dependent mechanism .
Furthermore , Schreck et al .
( 24 ) reported that diverse agents that can activate NF- « B act through a common mechanism involving the synthesis of reactive oxygen intermediates .
Therefore , we utilized electrophoretic mobility-shift assays to examine the effects of ionizing radiation on NF- « B in B-lymphocyte precursors .
Notably , irradiation with 10-40 Gy of y-rays stimulated a NF- « B-specific DNA-binding activity , as reflected by a marked increase in intensity of a shifted band that was observed when the NF- « B probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from Ramos cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
This retarded band was eliminated by competition with a 500-fold molar excess of Medical Sciences : Uckun et al .

PTK-dependent activation of PKC and PKC-dependent renaturable serine kinases in irradiated human B-lymphocyte precursors .

Cells were lysed 15 min after irradiation , and kinase renaturation assays were performed ( 10 ) with whole cell lysates ( A ) or immunoprecipitated PKC ( C ) .

3 ) .
By comparison , a 500-fold excess of unlabeled NF-1 control oligonucleotide did not compete with the NF- « B probe for binding to the retarded complex ( data not shown ) .
These results extend the findings of Brach et al .
( 23 ) on myeloid leukemia cells and provide unambiguous evidence that ionizing radiation activates NF- « B in human B-lymphocyte precursors .
We next examined the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in radiation-induced NF-KB activation .
To this end , Ramos cells were treated overnight with the potent PTK inhibitor herbimycin A prior to irradiation .
Herbimycin pretreatment substantially inhibited the formation of NF-kB protein-DNA complexes in extracts from irradiated Ramos cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
This observation does not exclude the possibility that ionizing radiation can activate NF- « B by several different mechanisms , but it indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation is an important step in radiation-induced activation of NF- « B in human B-lymphocyte precursors .
In summary , we examined the biochemical nature of signaling events in irradiated human B-lymphocyte precursors .
This report clarifies the chronological sequence of biochemical events that follow exposure to ionizing radia-tion .
In human B-lymphocyte precursors , ionizing radiation induces tyrosine phosphorylation by stimulation of as yet unidentified PTKs that are probably sensitive to reactive oxygen intermediates ( 5 ) .
The mechanism by which ionizing radiation triggers PTK s is unknown .
Irradiation subsequently leads to ( i ) stimulation of Ptdins turnover ; ( i ? )
downstream activation by covalent modification of multiple serine-specific protein kinases , including PKC ; and ( ii ? )
activation of NF- « B .
Our study of radiation-induced signaling events proximal to PKC activation has linked the downstream events of the PKC cascade to PTK-regulated proximal events .
Further , this report confirms previous reports by Weichselbaum and colleagues ( 1 , 2 ) that ionizing radiation can activate a PKC-dependent signaling pathway in human cells .
