Rapid Publication Shared y , , Subunit Within the Human Interleukin-7 Receptor Complex A Molecular Basis for the Pathogenesis of X-Linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Stephen Y. Lai , * Jaime Molden , * and Mark A. Goldsmith** *Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology , San Francisco , California 94141-9100 ; and *Department of Medicine , School of Medicine , University of California , San Francisco , California 94122 Abstract Genetic evidence suggests that mutations in the y , receptor subunit cause X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( X-SCID ) .
The y , subunit can be employed in receptor complexes for IL-2 , -4 , -7 , -9 , and -15 , and the multiple signaling defects that would result from a defective y , chain in these receptors are proposed to cause the severe phenotype of X-SCID patients .
Interestingly , gene disruption of either IL-7 or the IL-7 receptor ( IL-7R ) « subunit in mice leads to immunological defects that are similar to human X-SCID .
These observations suggest the functional importance of y , in the IL-7R complex .
In the present study , structure/function analyses of the IL-7R complex using a chimeric receptor system demonstrated that y , is indeed critical for IL-7R function .
Nonetheless , only a limited portion of the cytoplasmic domain of y , is necessary for IL-7R signal transduction .
Furthermore , replacement of the y , cytoplasmic domain by a severely truncated erythropoeitin receptor does not affect measured IL-7R signaling events .
These findings support a model in which y , serves primarily to activate signal transduction by the IL-7R complex , while IL-7Ra determines specific signaling events through its association with cytoplasmic signaling molecules .
Finally , these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that the molecular pathogenesis of X-SCID is due primarily to y.-mediated defects in the IL-7/IL-7R system .

a disease characterized by severe lymphopenia and recurring persistent infections in the first months of life ( 10-12 ) .
Additionally , gene deletion studies in mice of y , have revealed a similar immunodeficiency ( 13 , 14 ) .
The wide array of receptor signaling defects that result from y , mutations are hypothesized to lead to the severe immunological defects found in both X-SCID patients and murine models .
Recent studies , however , suggest that more selective signaling defects due to y , mutations may cause X-SCID and the murine immunodeficiency syndrome .
Gene ablation of IL-2 ( 15 ) and IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) B/IL-15RB ( 16 ) do not cause early developmental defects of the immune system .
Furthermore , IL-4 gene-ablation studies do not detect early lym-phopoietic and functional disturbances , suggesting that y.-inde-pendent forms of the IL-4R are biologically active ( 17-21 ) .
Additionally , the role of y , in the IL-9R complex remains undefined .
The y , subunit does not appear to modulate IL-9R binding affinity for IL-9 ( 8 ) and IL-9 may act primarily on mast cells ( 22 ) .
In contrast , gene disruption of either IL-7 ( 23 ) or the IL-7Ra subunit ( 24 ) leads to severe developmental perturba-tions .
Thus , signaling defects in the IL-7/IL-7R system resulting from changes in y , may be sufficient to account for the developmental anomalies that lead to X-SCID .
IL-7 was identified as a factor secreted by stromal cells of the bone marrow and thymus that stimulates proliferation of immature B and T lymphocytes ( 25-31 ) .
The biological effects of IL-7 are mediated through a receptor complex containing the IL-7Ra subunit ( 32 ) and the y , chain ( 3 , 6 , 9 ) .
Both of these receptor subunits are members of the cytokine receptor superfamily ( 33 ) , sharing a number of structural features including two partially conserved , intracellular regions termed Box1 and Box2 that are involved in Janus kinase ( JAK ) association ( 7 , 34-36 ) .
Engagement of these subunits by IL-7 leads to the activation of the Janus kinases , JAK1 and JAK3 , and the subsequent induction of a signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) factor , STAT-5 ( 7 , 19 , 37 ) .
Additionally , activation of the src-like kinase family members pS56lck , pS59fyn , and p53/pS56lyn has been reported in various cellular contexts ( 38-40 ) .
Downstream of the activation of tyrosine kinases is the activation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 ( IRS-1 ) 1 .

Mutations Result in IL-7 Receptor Signaling Defects 169 ( 41 ) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( 42 , 43 ) .
Collectively , these and related specific molecular events culminate in differentiation and proliferation by IL-7 .
While many of the specific signaling events activated by the IL-7R complex have been delineated , the functional roles of the receptor subunits themselves in generating these signals are relatively undefined .
However , the heterodimeric structure of the IL-7R complex suggests distinct functions for the individual receptor subunits .
Thus , the present studies were undertaken to identify the functional roles of IL-7Ra « and y , within the IL-7R complex .
These observations define the structural determinants of signaling specificity within the IL-7R complex and further clarify mechanisms associated with the molecular pathogenesis of X-SCID .

Mutations Result in IL-7 Receptor Signaling Defects 171 Results B cells from an X-SCID patient are unresponsive to multiple cytokines that bind to receptor complexes containing the y , subunit .
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines derived from X-SCID patients have various mutations in the y , gene .
For example , the SCID-MA cell line contains a mutation that results in the lack of detectable mRNA transcripts for the y , subunit ( reference 12 and data not shown ) .
To assess the functional consequences of this genetic defect , SCID-MA cells were stimulated with cytokines that employ y , -containing receptor complexes ( Fig .
1 ) .
The activation of STAT factors was evaluated in an electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay ( EMSA ) using an oligonucleotide probe that contains the IgG Fc receptor promoter element .
SCID-MA cells retained responsiveness to IL-4 , as demonstrated by the retarded mobility of the radiolabeled probe and anti-STAT-6 antibody competition ( Fig .
1 and data not shown ) .
Previous studies are consistent with the hypothesis that IL-4 may engage another receptor com-plex ( es ) that does not require the y , subunit ( 17-21 ) .
However , in the absence of a functional y , chain , SCID-MA cells were unresponsive to IL-2 , -7 , and -9 , raising the possibility that y , is critical for signaling by these receptor systems .
Since IL-2 and IL-9 do not appear to affect early lymphocyte devel-opment , further analysis of the IL-7R complex and its link to X-SCID was undertaken .
A chimeric receptor system recapitulates JAK-STAT signaling of the IL-7 receptor complex .
To investigate the functional roles of the individual receptor subunits in the IL-7 receptor complex , chimeric receptor subunits were formed by fusing the extracellular domain of the EPOR to the intracellular portions of IL-7Ra and y , to form EPOT7 and EPOy , respectively ( Fig .
2 A ) .
These chimeric receptor subunits were evaluated for their abilities to recapitulate IL-7 receptor signaling , specifically through the JAK-STAT pathway .
Stable transfectants expressing EPOT7 or EPOy were established in HT-2 cells , a murine helper T cell line .
Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis of JAK kinase immunoprecipitates from HT-2 stable transfectants demonstrated the phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 , but not JAK2 , in response to a positive control ligand , IL-2 ( Fig .
2 B and data not shown ) .
Upon EPO stimulation , neither the HT-2EPO7 nor the HT-2EPOy cell lines demonstrated an increase in the phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 when compared with unstimulated cells .
In contrast , a stable cell line expressing both EPO7 and EPOy subunits , HT-2EPOT7y , displayed a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 in response to EPO ( Fig .
2 B ) .
Therefore , activation of the chimeric receptor system leads to the induction of the same JAK kinases as those reportedly linked to the native IL-7 receptor complex ( 7 , 37 , 48 ) .
Activation of JAK kinases in cytokine receptor complexes typically leads to the recruitment and activation of STAT fac- é EPO7 EPOR ( 1-321 ) EPOT/EPOR ( 1-321 ) P 3g 100 100 100 IP : - JAK1 JAK2 JAK3 éﬁ so so so 32D/IRS-1 - U E U E U E 83 so so eo *-Te-=-o=-*-= £22 40 40 40 EPOT ' Y « uas -f Eé 20 20 20 E `` oo ioto0o - `` oo dioiioioiso - oo moiioioico - EPOT7/EPOR vag € ( 1-321 ) ld EPO ( U/ml ) D 32D/IRS-1 c EPOT7/EPOR 32D/IRS-1 _EPO7Y _ ( 1321 ) U E U E EPOT7/EPOR - EPOR vates EPO7 EPO ' Y EPOTY ( 1-321 ) ( 1-321 ) w U E W U E W U E W U E W | MMW , Mb .

tors ( 49 ) .
As demonstrated by EMSA using a probe corresponding to the IgG Fc receptor STAT responsive element , EPO stimulation of HT-2EPOT7 and HT-2EPOy cell lines did not result in activation of a specific DNA-binding activity ( Fig .
2 C ) .
Like the native IL-7 receptor complex ( 19 ) , engagement of both chimeric receptor subunits by EPO stimulation of the HT-2EPOT7y cell line resulted in the activation of STAT-5 ( Fig .
2 C ) .
This DNA-binding complex contained both STAT-5A and -5B , as demonstrated by specific antibody competition that diminished the presence of the retarded nu-cleoprotein complex .
To examine the IL-7R complex in another cell context , the chimeric receptor system was also established in 32D/IRS-1 , a promyeloid cell line that expresses IRS-1 ( 50 ) .
As in the HT-2 cell line , EPO stimulation of 32D/IRS-1 stable transfectants expressing EPO7 or EPOy alone did not affect the phosphorylation of JAK1 or JAK3 ( data not shown ) .
EPO stimulation of a 32D/IRS-1 stable cell line expressing both EPO7 and EPOy ( 32D/IRS-1/EPO7y ) resulted in a marked increase in the phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 ( Fig .
3 B ) .
Additionally , EPO stimulation of 32D/IRS-1/EPOT7 and 32D/IRS-1/EPOy cell lines did not result in the activation of DNA-binding activity ( Fig .
3 C ) .
However , EPO stimulation of a 32D cell line expressing both EPO7 and EPOy , 32D/IRS-1/EPOT7y , led to the activation of a DNA-binding complex ( Fig .
3 C ) .
To determine the composition of the DNA-binding complex , 32D/IRS-1/ EPO7 cellular lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the STAT-5A and -5B antibodies after activation of the EPO7/EPOy heterodimer .
Anti-STAT-5A immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates demonstrated the coimmuno-precipitation of STAT-5B with STAT-5A after EPO stimulation ( Fig .
2 £ ) .
Similarly , immunoprecipitates of the STAT-5A antibody demonstrated the EPO-induced association of STAT-5B ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , as in the IL-2R system ( 51 ) , signaling through the IL-7Ra/y , heterodimer results in the activation and heterodimerization of STAT-5A and -5B .
Thus , these findings demonstrate that signaling by the IL-7 receptor complex through the JAK-STAT pathway is reproduced by the chimeric receptor system in two cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cell lines .
Furthermore , heterodimerization of the cytoplasmic tails of IL-7Ra and y , are required to activate signal transduction by the IL-7R complex .
The cytoplasmic tyrosines of the y , subunit are not required for JAK-STAT signaling by the IL-7R complex .
Previous studies in the IL-2 and IL-4 receptor complexes demonstrated that the four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of the y , subunit were dispensable for signal transduction in response to those cytokines ( 20 , 46 , 51 ) .
To investigate the functional role of the tyrosine residues of the y , subunit in the IL-7R complex , HT-2 stable cell lines were established that expressed EPO7 and EPOyYF , a chimeric y , .
mutant in which all four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues are replaced by phenylalanines .
Like wild-type HT-2EPO7y cells , EPO-stimulation of two distinct HT-2EPO7/yYF cell lines resulted in the activation of a DNA-binding activity ( Fig .

Mutations Result in IL-7 Receptor Signaling Defects 173 this DNA-binding complex ( data not shown ) .
Thus , as in other ~y-containing receptor complexes , the specific JAK-STAT signaling events directed by the IL-7 receptor complex are independent of the tyrosine residues of the y , subunit .
Only the membrane-proximal portion of the y , subunit is necessary for growth signaling by the IL-7R .
Growth signaling mediated by the chimeric EPO7/EPOy heterodimer was evaluated in 32D/IRS-1 stable cell lines .
In PH ] thymidine incorporation assays , EPO stimulation of the 32D/IRS-1/EPO7 and 32D/IRS-1/EPOy cell lines did not induce detectable pro-liferative responses ( Fig .
4 A ) .
In contrast , 32D/IRS-1/EPO7y cells demonstrated a strong , dose-dependent proliferation in response to EPO .
Additionally , a transient transfection assay originally established to study the IL-2R ( 44 ) was employed to evaluate IL-7R complex subunit requirements .
In such experi-ments , expression of the EPOy expression plasmid in the 32D/ IRS-1/EPOT7 cell line restored EPO-induced proliferation signaling , as measured by [ PH incorporation ( Fig .
4 B ) .
Similarly , introduction of the EPO7 subunit into the 32D/IRS-1/EPOy cell line also restored growth signaling in response to EPO ( Fig .
5 ) .
Thus , heterodimerization of the IL-7R « and y , subunits is necessary and sufficient for IL-7-mediated growth signaling .
Establishment of the transfection assay in these cells permitted the rapid assessment of various y , mutants in the IL-7R complex .
The y , .
mutants included the previously described EPOyYF lacking all four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues , various truncation mutants , and internal deletion mutants lacking specific membrane-proximal regions of the y , subunit ( Fig .
4 C ) .
Expression of these chimeric y , mutants had been previously verified ( 44 ) .
As with JAK-STAT signaling , growth signaling was intact with the EPOyYF mutant ( Fig .
4 D ) .
Additionally , truncation of the y , subunit to the Box2 region ( EPOYy336 ) did not adversely affect EPO-mediated prolifera-tion .
However , more severe truncations of the chimeric y , mutant ( EPOyTM and EPOy318 ) resulted in the abrogation of growth signaling , demonstrating the importance of the membrane-proximal regions of y , in IL-7R function ( Fig .
4 D ) .
This finding was further verified by internal deletion mutants of the Box1 , V-Box , and Box2 regions of the y , chimeric receptor , each of which also abolished proliferation signaling ( Fig .
4 £ ) .
Therefore , only the membrane-proximal regions of the y , subunit are necessary and sufficient for growth signaling mediated by the IL-7Ra/y , heterodimer .
The y , subunit is functionally replaceable in the IL-7R complex for signal transduction .
Previous studies of the IL-2R complex demonstrated that the y , subunit serves primarily to activate receptor signaling , rather than to determine specific signaling events ( 52 ) .
Since comparable minimal structural elements of the y , subunit are required for IL-7R signaling , it is reasonable to predict that y , .
may perform a similar function in the IL-7Ra « /y , heterodimer .
To test this hypothesis , the y , subunit was replaced by a heterologous receptor subunit in the chimeric receptor system .
Specifically , the EPOy subunit was substituted by a truncated EPOR mutant , EPOR ( 1-321 ) , which retains only the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region that mediates JAK2 association ( 53 ) .
In PH ] thymidine-incor-poration assays , 32D/IRS-1 stable cell lines expressing EPO7 or EPOR ( 1-321 ) alone did not demonstrate a detectable proliferation signal in response to EPO ( Fig .
3 A ) .
However , EPO induced a vigorous growth response in cells that expressed both receptor subunits [ 32D/IRS-1/EPO7/EPOR ( 1-321 ) ] .
Thus , 174 _ Lai et al .

The cytoplasmic domain of the IL-7Ra « subunit is required for proliferation signaling .
Transient transfection assay was performed in 32D/IRS-1/EPOy cells .
downstream signaling events such as proliferation were unaffected by the substitution of the y , cytoplasmic domain by the truncated EPOR subunit .
Distinct molecular signaling events were evaluated to examine other potential consequences of this receptor subunit substitution .
As described above , the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 was increased upon EPO-stimulation of the 32DEPOT7y cell line ( Fig .

In the 32DEPOT7/EPOR ( 1-321 ) cell line , EPO stimulation resulted in the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 , but not of JAK3 .
Furthermore , this replacement of JAK3 by JAK2 in the IL-7R complex did not alter the specificity of the JAK-STAT pathway .
EMSA of nuclear extracts from 32D/IRS-1/EPOT7 and 32D/IRS-1/EPOR ( 1-321 ) cells demonstrated no detectable DNA-binding activity in response to EPO ( Fig .
3 C ) .
In contrast , EPO stimulated the induction of STAT-5 in 32D/IRS-1/ EPO7/EPOR ( 1-321 ) cells ( Fig .
3 C and data not shown ) .
Additionally , signaling through the IL-7R complex results in the activation of IRS-1 ( 41 ) .
Immunoblot analysis with the antiphosphotyrosine antibody of anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates demonstrated no detectable increase in phosphorylation of IRS-1 in EPO-stimulated 32D/IRS-1/EPO7 or 32D/IRS-1/ EPOy cells ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , IRS-1 demonstrated a marked EPO-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in 32D/IRS-1/EPOT7y cells ( Fig .
3 D ) .
Similarly , IRS-1 was phosphorylated upon EPO-induced heterodimerization of the IL-7Ra and truncated EPOR ( 1-321 ) cytoplasmic tails .
Therefore , a variety of specific signaling events mediated by the IL-7R complex occur independently of the presence of the y , subunit .
The y , subunit therefore appears to serve primarily to activate signaling by the IL-7R , rather than to specify signaling events directed by the receptor complex .
The distal portion of the IL-7Ra subunit is required for growth signaling .
Because the major role of the y , subunit within the IL-7 receptor complex appears to be during initiation of receptor signaling , it was hypothesized that the IL-7Ra subunit itself serves to direct distinct signaling events .
Specifically , the IL-7Ra subunit contains three tyrosine residues in the distal portion of the cytoplasmic tail , which may serve as docking sites for various signaling molecules .
To evaluate the functional contribution of IL-7Ra « in the receptor complex , a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular portion of EPOR and a truncated cytoplasmic portion of the IL-7Ra « subunit lacking the three distal tyrosines ( EPOT7gq ) was con-structed .
Expression of the EPO7g subunit was verified by immunoblotting of lysates from transfected COS cells ( data not shown ) .
In a transient transfection assay , expression of the wild-type EPOT7 subunit in 32D/IRS-1/EPOy cells led to the proliferation of these cells in response to EPO ( Fig .
5 ) .
Strik-ingly , introduction of the EPO7 ; rg subunit into this same cell line did not restore growth signaling .
Thus , the IL-7Ra « subunit and specifically , its distal cytoplasmic domain , are critical for proliferation signaling in the IL-7 receptor complex .
Discussion Genetic analysis indicates that human X-SCID results from mutations in the y , subunit ( 11 , 12 ) , a receptor chain shared by several cytokine receptors ( 1-9 ) .
While recent observations suggest that the most critical functional defects in X-SCID are manifested in the IL-7R system ( 23 , 24 , 54 , 55 ) , the specific role of y , in that receptor complex remains poorly defined .
The present studies analyzing the functional architecture of the IL-7R complex demonstrate the essential requirement of y , for proper IL-7R function .
Furthermore , these studies define the role of y , in the IL-7R complex , leading to a potential molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of X-SCID .
Structure/function analysis using a chimeric receptor system demonstrated the absolute requirement for heterodimerization of the IL-7Ra and y , cytoplasmic domains to activate IL-7-specific signaling events .
The EPO7/EPOy heterodimer activated STAT-5A and -5B in both HT-2 and 32D/IRS-1 stable transfectants .
However , in the HT-2 cellular context , STAT-5 activation alone was not sufficient to mediate proliferation ( data not shown ) , a finding that is presently being inves-tigated .
In the 32D/IRS-1 stable cell line , these molecular events were not affected by mutations in the y , subunit that COOH terminally truncated the cytoplasmic domain to the membrane-proximal Box2 region or converted the four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues to phenylalanines .
However , more severe truncation mutants or internal deletions of the membrane-proximal region of y , that binds JAK3 ( 7 ) abolished proliferation signaling .
These results complement recent studies in which a severely truncated y , subunit acted in a domi-nant-negative fashion to inhibit IL-7-mediated growth signaling ( 56 ) and demonstrate the critical contribution of the membrane-proximal segment of y , to IL-7R function .
In contrast , a relatively distal truncation of the IL-7Ra « subunit completely abrogated growth signaling by the IL-7R complex in the present system .
Thus , while both receptor subunits were observed to be essential for IL-7R signaling competence , the structural requirements for these subunits were quite distinct .
Collectively , these findings demonstrate an asymmetric structure/function organization in the IL-7R complex that is strikingly similar to the `` trigger-driver '' arrangement of the IL-2R complex ( 20 ) .
In this configuration , specific receptor signaling events are determined by a distinct profile of signaling intermediates that physically associate with a single `` driver '' subunit , represented by the IL-7Ra « chain .
For example , these interactions may be mediated by conserved SH2 or PTB domains within signaling molecules that interact with phosphorylated tyrosine residues embedded within specific peptide motifs of such receptor subunits ( 57 , 58 ) .
Indeed , in the IL-7Ra chain , removal of the three distal tyrosine residues was sufficient to abolish growth signaling by IL-7R .
This finding is consistent with the recent studies of the murine IL-7Ra subunit , which demonstrated the importance of a distal tyrosine residue for proliferation in B cell lymphopoiesis ( 59 ) .
Thus , the IL-7Ra subunit functions as a `` driver '' subunit in determining the specific signaling events mediated by the IL-7R complex .
As in another y.-containing receptor , the IL-2R system , the y. subunit transports JAK3 into the IL-7R complex to activate receptor signaling .
The initimate association of y , and JAK3 is confirmed by patients with JAK3 mutations who have immu-nodeficiencies that are very similar to X-SCID ( 60 ) .
Indeed , y.- and JAK3-deletion mice share similar immunodeficiency phenotypes ( 13 , 14 , 61 ) .
Furthermore , the nonfunctional y , mutants employed in the present studies affected similar portions of the y , subunit as mutations found in X-SCID patients ( 11 , 12 ) , and disrupted the membrane-proximal region of y , reported to mediate association with JAK3 ( 7 ) .
However , the requirement for JAK3 itself within this signaling complex is not absolute .
Functional replacement of the y , cytoplasmic domain by EPOR ( 1-321 ) did not alter downstream signaling events measured in the chimeric IL-7R system .
Furthermore , signaling via the EPO7/EPOR ( 1-321 ) heterodimer depended on the engagement of JAK1 and JAK2 , but not JAK3 ( data not shown ) .
Importantly , this substitution of JAK2 for JAK3 in this complex did not affect events such as cellular proliferation , phosphorylation of IRS-1 , or induction of STAT-5A or -5B .
Therefore , various signaling events previously thought to be linked to JAK3 itself may instead be coupled to the IL-7Ra `` driver '' chain ( 62 ) .
Thus , the present studies support the model that y , and JAK3 are not required for specific signaling events , but act instead as a relatively generic `` trigger '' for activation of receptor-mediated signal transduction .
Several experimental approaches have demonstrated the important role of the IL-7/IL-7R system to early lymphocyte development ( 23 , 24 , 54 , 55 ) .
The delineation of the functional role of the y , subunit within the IL-7R complex provides a possible molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of X-SCID .
y , defects that prevent the transport of JAK3 into the receptor complex would prevent IL-7-mediated signaling and the subsequent development of B and T cells .
Based on the present findings , the critical step affected by mutations in the y , subunits appears to be the initiation of IL-7R signal transduction .
Interestingly , unlike y.-deficient mice and X-SCID patients , IL-7- and IL-7Ra-deletion mice retain functional natural killer cells ( 63 ) , raising the possibility that an unrecognized cytokine ( s ) may also employ y.-containing receptor com-plex ( es ) .
Nevertheless , the developmental defects for T and B cells are at least as severe as those for X-SCID individuals and ~y.-deficient mice .
Therefore , these findings suggest that the earliest signaling events that would affect lymphocyte development in X-SCID appear to be mediated by the IL-7R complex .
While the y , subunit is present in other receptor complexes , such as the IL-2R , -4R , -9R , and -15R , these receptors appear to function in the later stages of lymphoid development and regulation .
Thus , the early block of lymphocyte development due to defects in IL-7R function would mask potential functional aberrations due to the lack of signaling by these recep-tors .
The present studies define the role of y , in the IL-7R complex and provide a possible molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of X-SCID .
These studies also define further at y , .
Mutations Result in IL-7 Receptor Signaling Defects 175 least two distinct classes of receptors that employ the y , subunit .
First , the IL-7R and -2R complexes exhibit a strict requirement for y , in the receptor complex .
In these receptor systems , y , initiates signaling by transporting the associated JAK3 into the receptor complex , while IL-7Ra « and -2Rf function in their respective receptor complexes to mediate specific signaling events .
Interestingly , a similar functional arrangement of the individual receptor subunits has recently been demonstrated in the interferon-y receptor complex ( 64 ) .
In the second class of receptors , represented by the IL-4R , y , is not absolutely essential for receptor function .
In SCID-MA cells , the lack of detectable y , expression ( reference 12 and data not shown ) does not affect IL-4 responsiveness ( Fig .
1 and reference 20 ) .
This observation supports the recent findings that the IL-4R complex may exist in multiple forms ( 17-21 ) .
In certain cell lines derived from X-SCID patients , mutant forms of y , may act in a dominant negative fashion to inhibit the IL-4-medi-ated activation of JAK3 and STAT-6 ( 65 ) .
In the absence of y , , another receptor subunit , perhaps the IL-13Ra « and/or other unidentified partner chains , may perform a similar role as that of the y , subunit during initiation of signaling through the receptor complex ( 17-21 , 66 ) .
This may account for the responsiveness of some gggece-negative cells to IL-4 .
Additionally , circumstantial evidence also exists for a homomeric form of IL-4R that consists of only the IL-4Ra subunit ( reference 20 and data not shown ) .
Further studies are in progress to determine the functional role of y , in the other receptors , such as the IL-9R complex , and to understand the structure/function arrangements of heterodimeric receptor systems .
