11840-11849 , 1997 Printed in U.S.A. Transcriptional Induction of Collagenase-1 in Differentiated Monocyte-like ( U937 ) Cells is Regulated by AP-1 and an Upstream Site* ( Received for publication , January 22 , 1997 , and in revised form , February 26 , 1997 ) Glenn A. R. Doyle $ , Richard A .
Pierce , and William C. Parks§ ] From the Dermatology Division , Department of Medicine , and §Department of Cell Biology and Physiology , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri 63110 In this report , we demonstrate that the AP-1 site and a distal promoter element regulate transcriptional induction of collagenase-1 during monocytic differentiation .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression constructs containing regions of the human collagenase-1 promoter were stably or transiently transfected into U937 cells , and reporter activity was assessed at various times after the onset of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -mediated differentiation .
Rapid and strong induction of promoter activity was lost in constructs with a mutant AP-1 element ; however , at 16-96 h post-PMA , the mutant collagenase-1 promoter displayed AP-1 independent PMA-mediated transactivation .
The AP-1 mutant constructs also showed delayed transcriptional activation in PMA-treated fibroblasts .
Western and supershift analyses indicated that functional Jun and Fos proteins were present in nuclear extracts of PMA-differentiated U937 cells .
Promoter deletion constructs demonstrated the potential role of distal promoter sequences in regulating collagenase-1 transcription .
In particular , Western , supershift , and promoter deletion analyses suggested a role for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein- ( C/EBP-B ) binding site between -2010 and -1954 in regulating transcription of collagenase-1 in monocytic cells .
Our findings suggest that distinct regulatory elements , acting somewhat independently of each other , control expression of collagenase-1 .
In addition , our data suggests that the rapid PMA-mediated induction of collagenase-1 transcription is controlled by a mechanism distinct from that regulating the sustained expression of this proteinase in activated macrophages .
Remodeling of the extracellular matrix during normal development and in response to tissue injury and inflammation is thought to be accomplished , in part , by the properly regulated production of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . ''

1-3 ) .
However , inappropriate expression of these protein-ases is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of various conditions , such as arthritis ( 4 , 5 ) , vascular disease ( 6-8 ) , metastasis ( 8 ) , and destructive skin diseases ( 9 ) .
Notably , collagenase-1 has been localized to resident and infiltrating inflammatory cells in many of these conditions ( 5 , 7 , 10-12 ) .
Although extracellular matrix proteins can be degraded by various proteinases , fibrillar type I collagen , the most abundant protein in the body , is resistant to degradation by most enzymes .
Collagen degradation is initiated by the catalytic activity of collagenases , a subgroup of the MMP gene family with the unique ability to cleave fibrillar collagens type I , II , and III within their triple helical domain ( 13 ) .
At physiological temperature , cleaved collagen molecules denature and become susceptible to complete digestion by other proteinases .
Of the three known human metallo-collagenases , collagenase-1 ( MMP-1 ) seems to be the enzyme that is principally responsible for collagen turnover in most human tissues .
In a variety of normal and disease-associated tissue remodeling events , collagenase-1 is expressed by macrophages as well as by epithelial cells , fibroblasts , endothelial cells , and chondrocytes ( 14-18 ) .
Collagenase-2 ( MMP-8 ) is found only in neutrophils and chondrocytes ( 19 , 20 ) , and collagenase-3 ( MMP-13 ) , originally cloned from a breast carcinoma line ( 21 ) , is also expressed in articular cartilage ( 22 , 23 ) and developing bone ( 24 ) .
Many agents , such as PMA , bacterial endotoxin ( lipopolysac-charide ) , and proinflammatory cytokines , and events , such as contact with type I collagen and activated T-cells , induce or markedly stimulate collagenase-1 transcription in macrophages ( 25-28 ) .
Much of what is known about the transcriptional regulation of collagenase-1 points to a critical role for the AP-1 site at -72 to -66 in the human promoter .
AP-1 elements bind dimers of the Jun ( c-Jun , JunB , and JunD ) and Fos ( c-Fos , FosB , Fra-1 , and Fra-2 ) families of transcription factors ( 29 ) .
Angel et al .
( 30 ) first demonstrated that the AP-1 site is necessary and sufficient to confer PMA-mediated induction of the native collagenase-1 promoter or of a heterologous promoter containing this element .
However , because the level of PMA-mediated induction was greater with larger collagenase-1 promoter constructs , they concluded that elements upstream of the AP-1 site might also be important in regulating collagenase-1 .
Indeed , the AP-1 site , the polyoma enhancer A-binding protein-3 site ( -91 to -83 ) and the `` TTCA '' element ( -105 to -102 ) are also required for full PMA-mediated induction in fibroblasts ( 31 , 32 ) .

g 0 9 km i We assessed the requirement of the AP-1 site and more distal promoter sequences to collagenase-1 gene activation during and subsequent to monocytic differentiation .
We used PMA-treated U937 cells as an in vitro model because they mimic the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages ( 83 ) and because activation of collagenase-1 expression in these cells occurs strictly by a transcriptional mechanism ( 27 , 34 ) .
We report that collagenase-1 promoter activity is induced and maintained in the absence of a functional AP-1 site .
We conclude that although the AP-1 site is required to mediate strong collagenase-1 transcription , other upstream elements , including a newly identified CCAAT/enhancer-binding ( C/ EBP- $ ) site , participate in achieving maximal and sustained PMA-mediated collagenase-1 transactivation in monocytic cells .
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture-U937 cells ( 85 ) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( CRL 1593 ) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium ( Life Technologies , Inc. , Gaithersburg , MD ) supplemented with 10 % low endotoxin fetal calf serum ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , non-essential amino acids , L-glutamine , sodium pyruvate , 100 units/ml penicillin , and 100 pg/ml streptomycin .
For induction of cell differentiation , U987 cells were plated at 5 X 10° cells/ml and exposed to 8 X 10~ '' M PMA ( Sigma ) .
Human skin fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium , 10 % fetal calf serum ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) containing the same supplements listed above .
RNA and Transcription Analyses-Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium phenol extraction method ( 86 ) .
Conditions for Northern hybridization and washes were as described ( 27 ) .
Blots were hybridized with a 2.2-kb human collagenase-1 ( 87 ) , a 2.0-kb human c-fos ( 88 ) , a 1.2-kb human c-jun ( 89 ) , or a 1.3-kb rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogeanse ( 40 ) random-primed , *°P-labeled cDNA probe .
Filters were washed and then visualized by autoradiography .
Transcription rates of specific mRNAs were measured using 2.5 X 10 '' isolated nuclei as described ( 41 ) .
Nascent RNA transcripts were isolated , and equivalent counts of *°P-labeled RNA were hybridized to denatured , gel-purified cDNA inserts slotted on nitrocellulose .
As an indicator of total transcription , a 2.5-kb pair human Alu repeat fragment derived from the e-globin gene ( 42 ) was blotted as well .
Plasmids and Constructs-Fig .
1 shows maps of all collagenase-1 promoter constructs used in this study .
pBLCAT2 contains the -105/ +51 region of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter fused to a CAT reporter gene ( 48 ) pAPCAT2a is derived from pBLCAT2 , and contains a tandem triplet of the collagenase-1 AP-1 site subcloned 5 ' of the TK promoter .
A plasmid containing the -2278/+86 region of the human collagenase-1 promoter ( 44 ) was generously pro ann papoatze seroate vided by Dr. Steven Frisch ( La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation , La Jolla , CA ) .
To eliminate the possibility of transcriptional differences due to the vector backbone , all collagenase-1 promoter sequences were subcloned into pBLCAT2 .
The TK promoter of pBLCAT2 was removed during the synthesis of the collagenase-1 promoter deletion constructs ( Fig .
14 ) .
The p-2278CAT , p-2278MCAT , p-511CAT , p-179CAT , p-95CAT , and p-72CAT vectors were generated by PCR as described ( 26 ) .
Constructs p-2010CAT , p-1954CAT , p-1689CAT , p-1552CAT , p-1197CAT , and p-997CAT were made by digestion of p-2278CAT with BsaHI , Hpal , XmnI , EcoRV , Bgill , or BamHI , respectively .
The digestion products were blunted ( when necessary ) with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase , further digested with XhoI , and the appropriate blunt/Xhol fragment was subcloned into blunted-HindII/Xhol digested pBLCAT2 .
The internal deletion construct , p-1197A-997CAT , was created by cutting p-2278CAT with BgiII and BamHI followed by ligation of the vector .
Internal deletion construct p-2010A-1954CAT was created by recombinant , whole plasmid PCR ( 45 ) using the 5 ( ATAgcatgeACCCT-GGAAGAGTCTCAT ) and the 3° ( CGCgeatgeCTATTAACTCACCCT-TGT ) primers ( deleted/mutated sequences in lowercase ) .
The PCR product was digested with SpAI and ligated .
The resultant construct was digested with HindIII and BamHI , and the HindlIVBamHI fragment was subcloned into HindIIWV/BamHI cut p-2278CAT .
All PCR was performed with either Vent '' or Deep Vent '' DNA polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) to minimize unwanted mutations .
All newly created plasmids were sequenced to verify that only the desired alterations were introduced during PCR steps .
Sequencing reactions were done using a Sequenase '' Kit ( U. S. Biochemical Corp. , Cleveland , OH ) .
Heterologous promoter constructs contain collagenase-1 promoter sequences upstream of -997 linked to the TK promoter .
These were constructed by subcloning the BamHI/Xhol TK promoter fragment of pBLCAT2 into deletion constructs that had been digested with BamHI and Xhol .
For example , p-2278CAT gives rise to p-2278TKCAT , in which -2278 is the most 5 and -997 ( at the BamHI site ) is the most 3 ' nucleotide of the collagenase-1 promoter fragment ( Fig .
1B ) .
Stable U937 Transfectants-U987 cells ( 10 '' in 0.5 ml ) were transfected with 5 ug of linearized pRSV-Neo and 50 ug of linearized pBLCAT2 , pAPCAT2a , p-72CAT , p-511CAT , p-2278CAT , or p-2278MCAT .
Cells were electroporated at 250 V and 600 microfarads in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette using a BTX 8000 electroporator ( Biotechnolo-gies and Experimental Research , Inc. , San Diego , CA ) , placed on ice for 10 min , added to 9 ml of culture medium , centrifuged to pellet the cells , and plated in 10 ml of fresh medium .
After 24 h , cells were shifted to medium supplemented with 400 pg/ml Geneticin® ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
After 2 weeks , G-418-resistant cells were subcloned by limiting dilution or maintained as a pooled population of clones in medium containing 200 ug/ml Geneticin® .
To minimize insertion effects , two groups of stable clones , one consisting of 6 clones and the other of 12 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 11842 clones , were pooled .
Southern hybridization with *°P-labeled CAT cDNA was done on individual clones and demonstrated that incorporated DNA was roughly equivalent among clones ( data not shown ) .
Transient Transfections-U987 cells were transfected by a modification of the DEAE-dextran method essentially as described ( 26 , 46 ) .
Human skin fibroblasts were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation .
After transfection , cells were allowed to recover for 24 h prior to treatment with PMA .
After recovery , cultures were divided equally and cells were plated in medium with or without PMA .
After transfection , cells were given fresh medium and allowed to recover for 24 h prior to treatment with PMA .
Hirt extraction ( 47 ) and Southern hybridization with *°P-labeled CAT cDNA was done to determine transfection efficiency .
CAT Assays-At the indicated times , cells were harvested , washed , and lysed in 200 pl of 250 mM Tris , pH 7.8 , by freeze-thawing .
Lysates were incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then cleared of debris by cen-trifugation .
Equivalent amounts ( 25-100 ug ) of cleared lysate , normalized to total protein ( Bradford protein assay ; Bio-Rad ) , were assayed for CAT activity using acetyl-CoA ( Sigma ) and [ '*CJchloramphenicol essentially as described ( 48 ) .
Reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography .
Results were quantified by cutting and counting the appropriate spots from the chromatography plate .
Relative induction was obtained by dividing percent acetylation of treated versus untreated samples .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Supershift Assays-Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al .
( 49 ) .
The integrity of all nuclear extract preparations was assessed by determining the ability of proteins to bind a radiolabeled Oct-1 double-stranded oligomer ( data not shown ) .
Oct-1 protein binding was constitutive and , thus , served as an internal control .
Only extracts without apparent protein degradation were used .
For AP-1 studies , double-stranded oligomers containing either wild-type ( GATCAAAGCATGAGTCAGACACCT ) or mutant ( GATCAAAGCAceegggAGACACCT ) human collagenase-1 promoter sequence were used as probes and competitors .
For the binding analyses to the upstream region at -2010 to -1954 , double-stranded oligomers containing collagenase-1 promoter sequence between -2013 to -1990 ( TGACGTCTTAGGCAATTTCCTGTC ) , -1994 to -1968 ( CT-GTCCAATCACAGATGGTCACATCAC ) , and -1970 to -1947 ( CACAT-GCTGCTTTCCTGAGTTAAC ) were used as probes ( J , 2 , and 3 in Fig .
10 ) .
Competition was done with oligomers 1 , 2 , or 3 , wild-type ( TGCA-GATTGCGCAATCTGCA ) or mutant ( TGCAGAgactagtcTCTGCA ) C/EBP consensus oligomers ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , or with a wild-type ( AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC ) NF- « B consensus oligomer ( Promega Corp. , Madison , WI ) .
Double-stranded oligomers were radiolabeled with [ y-* '' PIJATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase or with [ « -* '' P ] dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polym-erase .
Binding reactions and electrophoresis conditions were as described ( 26 ) .
Equivalent amounts of nuclear protein ( 5 pg ) and probe counts were used in all reactions .
Supershift reactions were identical to those described above , except 1 ug of appropriate antibody was added to the binding reactions after addition of the labeled probes and reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C prior to electrophoresis .
The pan-Jun , pan-Fos , and pan-C/EBP antibodies were c-Fos [ 4-10G ] , and C/EBP-B [ A198 ] , respectively .
The antibodies specific to c-Jun , JunB , JunD , c-Fos , FosB , and C/EBP-B were c-Jun/AP-1 [ N ] , JunB [ N-17 ] , JunD { 829 ] , c-Fos [ 4 ] , FosB [ 102 ] , and C/EBP-B [ C-19 ] , respectively .
All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
Western Analysis of Nuclear Proteins-Equivalent amounts of nuclear proteins were prepared for electrophoresis by adding 1 volume of 2 X sample buffer and B-mercaptoethanol to 50 mM .
Samples were boiled for 1 min and separated through a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
Gels were equilibrated in 1 X transfer buffer ( 10 mm CAPS , 10 % methanol , pH 11.0 ) prior to transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride paper .
After transfer , membranes were blotted according to the procedures suggested by Santa Cruz Biotechnology .
Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence .
RESULTS Kinetics of Collagenase-1 Expression-We reported that collagenase-1 transcription is induced in U937 cells at 16-24 h after exposure to PMA ( 34 ) .
We used various assays to more carefully examine the kinetics of this differentiation-dependent induction .
Collagenase-1 mRNA was not detected in untreated U937 cells ( Fig .

Collagenase-1 transcription is induced in PMA-treated U937 cells .
U937 cells were treated with 8 X 10~® M PMA for 4-48 h , then processed for : A , Northern hybridization ; B , nuclear run-off anal-ysis ; or C , CAT assay .
A , total RNA was isolated from U937 cells at the times indicated and 5 ug were analyzed by blot hybridization with *P -labeled cDNAs for collagenase-1 ( Case ) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogeanse ( GAPDH ) mRNAs .
Autoradiography was for 18 h. B , nuclei were isolated from control U9837 cells ( -PMA ) and from cells treated with PMA for 12 , 24 , or 48 h. Nascent transcripts were isolated , and equal amounts of *°P-labeled pre-mRNA were hybridized to an Alu repeat sequence ( Alz ) or to full-length cDNAs for collagenase-1 ( Case ) and B-actin .
The autoradiograms shown are of a run-off experiment with nuclei from control ( - ) and 48 h PMA-treated ( + ) U987 cells .
Autoradiography was for 6 days .
Band intensity was quantified by densitometry .
Background hybridization was subtracted from gene-specific hybridization signal , and the data in the histogram are expressed relative to the signal for Alu .
Five run-offs were done for the 0 and 48-h time points , and the results are shown as the mean + S.E .
Transcription at 12 and 24 h post-PMA was assessed once .
C , U937 cells were transiently transfected with p-2278CAT and treated with PMA 24 h later .
Cells were harvested and lysed at 4-48 h after the start of PMA exposure , and CAT activity was assessed using 50 pg of cell lysates .
The results shown are representative of four separate experiments .
post-PMA .
Nuclear run-off assays demonstrated that collagenase-1 transcription was detectable at 12 h of PMA differentiation and remained at a constant level thereafter ( Fig .
2B ) .
These observations demonstrate that the onset of collagenase-1 induction occurs earlier than reported previously ( 34 ) .
CAT activity conferred by the full-length collagenase-1 promoter construct ( p-2278CAT ) in transiently transfected , PMA-treated U937 cells paralleled the pattern of induction of the endoge-nous gene ( Fig .
2C ) .
Only slight background CAT activity was seen in untreated cells .
By 4 h post-PMA , promoter activity was increased , and maximal and sustained levels of CAT activity were achieved by 8 h post-PMA .
Consistent results were obtained in four separate experiments .
A similar time course for induction of collagenase-1 promoter activity was observed in stable transformants ( Fig .
3 , -2278 ) .
Full induction of the wild-type collagenase-1 promoter was detected at 6 h after PMA treatment , and the levels were maintained for up to 96 h ( Figs .
2C and 3 ) .
These data indicate that events necessary for maximal induction of collagenase-1 are activated within 4-6 h post-PMA .
The AP-1 Site Is Not Necessary for Delayed Induction or Maintenance of Collagenase-1 Transcription-Stable transformants were created to determine if a functional AP-1 site is needed for collagenase-1 induction .
The proximal AP-1 site in the -2278/+36 promoter fragment was replaced with a Smal recognition site ( Fig .
14 ) .
Gel shift analysis with labeled mutant oligomer demonstrated that the mutated AP-1 site does 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog Transcriptional Regulation of Collagenase-1 -2278 Fic .

Collagenase-1 promoters wt aa containing wild-type or mutant AP-1 element are induced in stably transfected U937 cells .
U937 cells were transfected with p-2278CAT or p-2278MCAT , and stable clones were selected and pooled .
10 '' cells of each population were treated with PMA for the times indicated , and o 0.5 CAT activity in cell lysates was assessed .
For the lines containing the wild-type construct ( -2278 ) , CAT assays were done with 25 ug of total protein for 24 h ( lef ? )
or 12 h ( right ) .
For the mutant construct ( -2278M ) lines , CAT assays were done with 100 ug of total protein for 24 h. For all constructs , results shown are representative data of three experiments each with both pooled populations .
not bind nuclear proteins ( data not shown ) .
In two groups of pooled clones , mutation of the AP-1 site ( p-2278MCAT ) eliminated the rapid ( Ge .
by 4-6 h ) and strong transactivation observed with the wild-type construct ( p-2278CAT ) ( Fig .
3 ) .
Between 0 and 8 h post-PMA , no CAT activity was detected in U937 cells stably transfected with the mutant AP-1 construct ( data not shown ) .
However , transcriptional induction of the mutant AP-1 collagenase-1 promoter was consistently detected at 16 h post-PMA ( Fig .
3 , -2278M ) .
Although CAT activity expressed by -2278MCAT was much lower than that conferred by the wild-type promoter , the level of CAT activity was maintained for up to 96 h after PMA differentiation , similar to the sustained activity from the wild-type promoter ( Fig .
3 ) .
Experiments with individual stable clones showed the same patterns of induction with both the wild-type and mutant promoters ( data not shown ) .
Southern hybridization demonstrated that incorporated DNA was roughly equivalent among stable lines ( data not shown ) .
AP-1 Independent Induction of the Collagenase-1 Promoter Is Not Restricted to Monocytic Cells-PMA treatment stimulated activation of the wild-type collagenase-1 promoter in human skin fibroblasts ( Fig .
4 , -2278 ) .
Basal activity of the wild-type collagenase-1 promoter was high in these cells , likely due to constitutive c-Jun expression ( data not shown ) , but at 8 and 24 h post-PMA , CAT activity increased .
Mutation of the AP-1 site eliminated the high basal activity seen with the wild-type collagenase-1 promoter ( Fig .
4 , -2278M ) .
However , similar to that observed in differentiated U937 cells , p-2278MCAT conferred transcriptional induction in transiently transfected fibroblasts at 8 and 24 h post-PMA ( Fig .
4 , -2278M ) .
Thus , the collagenase-1 promoter can be transcriptionally induced by PMA in the absence of a functional proximal AP-1 element .
Time matched controls incubated without PMA had the same level of CAT activity for p-2278CAT or p-2278MCAT as did the 0 h cells ( data not shown ) .
c-Jun and c-Fos Are Present in Early and Late U937 Nuclear Extracts-The kinetics of c-fos and c-jun expression were assessed by Northern analysis ( data not shown ) .
In contrast to the delayed kinetics of collagenase-1 induction ( Fig .
2 ) and in full agreement with data from others ( 50-52 ) , c-fos and c-jun transcripts were detected as early as 15 min post-PMA , peaked between 1 and 2 h after PMA addition , and were sustained at low levels over the next 48 h ( data not shown ) .

The mutant AP-1 collagenase-1 promoter is stimulated in fibroblasts .
Human skin fibroblasts were transiently transfected with either p-2278CAT or p-2278MCAT , and treated with PMA 24 h later .
At the times indicated , cells were harvested and lysed , and equal amounts of extract ( 50 ug ) were assessed for CAT activity .
tion is regulated ( 53 ) , we used an immunoblotting assay to detect Fos family proteins in nuclear extracts from untreated and PMA-differentiated U937 cells .
c-Fos protein was detected in both 1- and 24-h post-PMA nuclear extracts using pan-Fos or c-Fos-specific antibodies ( Fig .
5 ) .
The upward shift in the c-Fos band seen in the 24-h extract may be due to increased protein phosphorylation ( 54 ) .
While the presence of c-Fos in nuclear extracts at 1 h post-PMA was anticipated , the clear abundance of c-Fos protein in the 24-h extract was not .
A previous report indicated that c-Fos protein could not be detected in PMA-differentiated U937 cells after 2 h of treatment ( 50 ) .
Because these authors immunoprecipitated metabolically-labeled protein from whole cell extracts , they may have underestimated c-Fos protein levels during periods of low c-Fos protein synthe-sis .
We detected no FosB protein by immunoblotting nuclear extracts from untreated or PMA-treated U937 cells with a FosB-specific antibody ( data not shown ) .
Proteins distinct from c-Fos were detected by the pan-Fos antibody in the nuclear extract from untreated cells , but not in those from PMA-treated cells .
The identity of these proteins is uncertain , but their sizes are consistent with the Fos-related proteins Fra-1 ( 29.4 kDa ) and Fra-2 ( 35.2 kDa ) which are expressed in U937 cells ( 55 ) .
Regardless of the identity of the bands in basal cell extracts , only c-Fos was detected in nuclear extracts of PMA-differentiated U937 cells ( Fig .
5 ) .
The low molecular weight forms seen in the 1- and 24-h extracts with the c-Fos-specific antibody are probably c-Fos degradation products .
We also used the immunoblotting assay to detect Jun family proteins in nuclear extracts from untreated and PMA-differentiated U937 cells .

Jun and Fos family proteins are found in nuclear extracts of U937 cells .
Nuclei were isolated from control U937 cells and from cells treated with 8 X 10~® M PMA for 1 or 24 h. Nuclear proteins were extracted and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and Fos and Jun family proteins were detected by immunoblotting .
Both pan-Fos and c-Fos-specific antibodies detected c-Fos protein ( arrow ) .
A c-Jun-specific antibody detected c-Jun protein in 1- and 24-h extracts ( arrow ) .
The numbers next to the gels indicate the migration of molecular weight standards .
The results shown are representative of three experiments .
tein was detected in nuclear extracts of U937 cells treated with PMA for 1 or 24 h ( Fig .
5 ) .
The high molecular weight bands detected in all extracts may be due to ubiquitination ( 56 ) or altered phosphorylation of c-Jun ( 57 ) .
Because c-Jun is not expressed in basal U937 cells , the low molecular mass bands between 30 and 20 kDa seen in all samples are likely nonspe-cific products .
No additional bands were detected with the pan-Jun or JunB antibodies ( data not shown ) .
Nuclear Proteins c-Fos and c-Jun Bind the Collagenase-1 AP-1 Site-Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays were done to confirm the presence of active AP-1 binding Jun/ Fos dimers .
Nuclear extracts from untreated cells did not support binding to a double-stranded oligomer containing the native collagenase-1 AP-1 site , where as extracts from 4 , 8 , and 24 h PMA-treated cells exhibited strong binding activity ( Fig .
6 ) .
The binding activity was competed by excess unlabeled wild-type AP-1 oligomer ( Fig .
6 , 24C ) but not by excess oligomer containing the mutated AP-1 site or by an unrelated sequence ( data not shown ) .
In addition , radiolabeled , double-stranded mutant AP-1 oligomers showed no binding to nuclear proteins ( data not shown ) .
Supershift analysis demonstrated that JunD and c-Fos were present in the shifted complexes ( Fig .
6 ) .
We consistently detected a weak supershifted complex with the c-Jun antibody and a very weak , if any , complex for JunB .
Neither the relative amounts of shifted complexes nor their composition changed at any time after the onset of PMA differentiation .
A FosB-specific antibody did not supershift complexes formed in extracts from PMA-treated cells ( data not shown ) .
The lack of other Fos family proteins agrees with our immunoblotting data ( Fig .
5 ) .
Although we can not definitively determine the identity of the Jun component , these results suggest that heterodimers of c-Fos and Jun family proteins contribute to maximal collagenase-1 transcriptional induction at early and late times of U937 differentiation .
Transient Transfection of Collagenase-1 Promoter Constructs in U937 Cells-Because the mutant AP-1 collagenase-1 promoter was induced by PMA , we assessed the influence of regions upstream of the proximal AP-1 site during collagenase-1 induction in U937 cells .
Cells were transfected with the various promoter constructs , and CAT activity was assessed at 24 h after addition of PMA .
Southern hybridization of Hirt extracted DNA indicated equivalent transfection efficiency among constructs and that the level of plasmid DNA remained constant up to 72 h after transfection ( 48 h post-PMA , data not shown ) .
For presentation , we have divided the collagenase-1 promoter into upstream ( -2278 to -511 ) and downstream ( -511 to +36 ) regions .
Transcriptional Regulation of Collagenase-1 Relative to p-2278CAT ( number 1 ) , induction of construct p-511CAT ( number 11 ) was reduced by 50 % in response to PMA differentiation ( Fig .
7 ) , and p-511CAT had similar activity in PMA-treated stable transformants ( data not shown ) .
Deletion of sequences between -511 and -179 ( p-179CAT , number 12 ) resulted in no further decrease in PMA responsiveness relative to p-511CAT ( number 11 ) .
However , PMA responsiveness was further reduced when sequences between -179 and -95 were deleted ( -95CAT , number 13 ) .
Weak , yet reproducible transcriptional induction was observed with the smallest AP-1 containing collagenase-1 promoter construct , p-72CAT ( number 14 ) .
CAT activity from this construct was also stimulated to a similar degree in PMA-treated stably transfected U937 cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the AP-1 site , in the absence of upstream sequences , was sufficient for minimal PMA responsiveness .
However , because the level of induction observed with p-72CAT ( number 14 ) is extremely low compared with most other constructs , other upstream elements are needed for full activation of collagenase-1 transcription by PMA differentiation .
Although mutation of the AP-1 site , in the context of the full-length promoter ( p-2278MCAT , number 2 ) resulted in a loss of detectable PMA responsiveness in transiently transfected U937 cells , this construct was induced in stably transformed cells ( -2278M ; Fig .
3 ) .
Hirt extraction ( 47 ) verified that p-2278 MCAT entered transiently transfected cells with the same efficiency as other constructs ( data not shown ) .
The seemingly contradictory transfection data with construct p-2278MCAT ( Figs .
3 and 7 ) can be reconciled by the greater sensitivity inherent in the use of stable lines versus transient transfections .
In constructs containing the wild-type AP-1 element , deletion of sequences -2278 to -997 ( p-997CAT , number 9 ) diminished both baseline and PMA-induced transcription ( Fig .
7 ) , and the fold induction was decreased about 2-fold relative to the wild type ( p-2278CAT , number 1 ) construct ( Fig .
7B ) .
Deletion of sequences between -2278 and -2010 ( p-2010CAT , number 3 ) and between -1197 and -997 ( p-1197A-997CAT , number 10 ) had only a minor effect on promoter activity in basal U937 cells or induction in PMA-differentiated cells ( Fig .
7 ) .
In contrast , promoter activity was markedly reduced and fold induction decreased relative to p-2278CAT ( number 1 ) upon deletion of sequences between -2010 and -1954 from the collagenase-1 promoter ( p-1954CAT to p-997CAT , and p-2010A-1954CAT , numbers 4-9 ) .
To further characterize the upstream regions of the collagenase-1 promoter ( -2278 to -997 ) , we constructed a series of heterologous promoter constructs containing various fragments of the distal collagenase-1 promoter linked to the TK promoter of pBLCAT2 ( Fig .
1B ) .
CAT activity from the TK promoter of pBLCAT2 was not changed by PMA treatment of U937 cells ( Figs .
7 and 8 ) .
Constructs p-2278TKCAT and p-2010TKCAT clearly responded to PMA ( Fig .
8 ) .
Like construct p-2278MCAT , these constructs conferred PMA responsiveness in the absence of the proximal collagenase-1 AP-1 element .
However , once sequences between -2010 and -1954 were deleted , the heterologous constructs ( p-1954TKCAT to p-1197TKCAT ) responded weakly or not at all to PMA treatment ( Fig .
8 ) .
C/EBP-B Is Present in Nuclear Extracts of U937 Cells and Interacts with Collagenase-1 Promoter Sequences between -2010 and -1954-The data with the mutant AP-1 construct ( Fig .
3 , -2278M ) and the drop in PMA-mediated transactivation between p-2010TKCAT and p-1954TKCAT ( Fig .

AP-1 binding activity of Fos and Jun family proteins in U937 nuclear extracts .
Nuclear extracts from control U937 cells and from cells treated with PMA for 4 , 8 , or 24 h were incubated with a radiolabeled , double-stranded AP-1 probe .
No binding activity was seen in nuclear extracts of untreated U9837 cells ( 0 ) .
With nuclear extracts from PMA-treated U937 cells , free probe ( FP ) was shifted ( S ) .
The shifted band was effectively competed by co-incubation with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe ( 24C ) .
Addition of antibodies to Fos family ( pan-Fos and c-Fos-specific ) and Jun family proteins ( pan-Jun , c-Jun , and JunD , but not JunB ) resulted in a supershift ( SS ) species of the bound probe ( S ) .

A putative C/EBP-binding site ( TTAG-GCAATT ) and NF- « B-like site ( GGCAATTTCC ) were identified between -2013 and -1990 .
Because the C/EBP family of transcription factors can regulate cellular differentiation ( 58 ) , we looked for the presence of C/EBP proteins in U937 nuclear extracts .
Immunoblotting of nuclear extracts with a pan-C/EBP antibody detected only one band of about 42 kDa ( Fig .

Detection with a specific antibody verified that this band was C/EBP-8 ( Fig .

Furthermore , these analyses demonstrated 3 4 5 6 ? % % m % % @ % @ m 12 13 14 15 16 that the relative abundance of C/EBP-B in U937 nuclear extracts increased with time of PMA treatment .

To determine if C/EBP-B could bind the sequences between -2013 and -1990 of the collagenase-1 promoter , we performed gel shift and supershift analyses with a double-stranded oligomer encompassing this region ( Fig .

important in regulating maintained collagenase-1 expression by macrophages actively involved in tissue remodeling events associated with inflammation .
As is discussed , C/EBP-B may mediate the AP-1-independent response and maximize AP-1-dependent responses in differentiated monocytes .
Studies on the collagenase-1 promoter have concluded that the proximal AP-1 site is a key element necessary for rapid and differentiated cells bound this sequence ( Fig .
10 , left ) .
In agreement with the immunoblotting data , the quantity of shifted probe increased with time after PMA treatment .

We find that c-Fos is shift when incubated with nuclear extracts from control or _ the only Fos family protein expressed in U937 nuclei after PMA PMA-treated cells ( number 3 , data not shown ) or had only - differentiation ( Fig .

C/EBP-B binds to an upstream element of the collagenase-1 promoter .
Nuclear extracts were isolated from U9837 cells treated with PMA for 0 , 4 , 8 , or 24 h and incubated with a radiolabeled , double-stranded oligomer containing the collagenase-1 C/EBP and NF- « B-like sites ( region 1 in schematic ) .

Identical results were obtained with a second set of extracts .
role for JunD can not be excluded , we suggest that c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers are involved in induction of collagenase-1 expression in U937 cells and stimulated monocytes .
Comparable to findings in HeLa cells ( 30 ) , but in contrast to those in fibroblasts ( 31 ) , we found that the AP-1 element confers a minimal response to PMA in U937 cells ( Fig .
7B ) .
However , in association with the AP-1 site , the region between -179 and -95 of the collagenase-1 promoter was needed for strong PMA responsiveness in U937 cells ( Fig .
7B ) .
In fibroblasts , PMA- and oncogene-mediated transactivation of collagenase-1 is enhanced when a complete `` 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate/oncogene - responsive - unit , '' - polyoma enhancer A-binding protein-3 , and AP-1 elements in tandem , is present in promoter constructs ( 32 ) .
In monocytic cells , the polyoma enhancer A-binding protein-3 site ( -91 to -83 ) may not be critical for up-regulating collagenase-1 expression since only a small difference in promoter induction is seen between .
constructs p-95CAT and p-72CAT , with both responses being relatively weak ( 1.5-2-fold ; Fig .
7B ) .
Indeed , other studies have shown that the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate/onco-gene responsive unit is not sufficient to maximally stimulate collagenase-1 transcription in response to PMA ( 80 , 31 ) .
In contrast to the weak induction of p-72CAT and p-95CAT , p-179CAT confers much of the PMA responsiveness ( 5-fold ) observed in U937 cells ( Fig .
7B ) .
In the analogous region of the rabbit collagenase-1 promoter , a `` TTCA '' element ( -105 to -100 ) and less characterized sequences at -182 to -161 are necessary to confer strong PMA responsiveness in fibroblasts ( 31 , 62 ) .
There is extensive homology ( 95-100 % identical in the areas mentioned ) between the human and rabbit promoters within this downstream region .
This fact , together with the decreased PMA-mediated induction observed when sequences -179 to -95 are deleted ( Fig .
7B ) suggests the possibility that factors binding these sequences may play some role in activating collagenase-1 expression in monocytic cells .
Nonetheless , although this downstream region conferred much of the PMA responsiveness , distal upstream promoter elements were needed to achieve a maximal response ( Fig .
7B ) .
Consistent with the kinetics of c-Fos and c-Jun expression , the AP-1 element is needed for rapid and strong PMA-mediated induction of collagenase-1 transcription in U937 cells .
However , our data indicate that , distal upstream elements are required to maximize AP-1-dependent induction and can induce and maintain collagenase-1 expression in an AP-l-independent manner .
Most compelling is that the AP-1 mutant construct , p-2278MCAT , displayed delayed , yet maintained , PMA-mediated activation in U937 cells and fibroblasts ( Figs .
3 and 4 ) .
While Buttice et al .
( 63 ) showed that mutation of the analogous AP-1 site in the related stromelysin-1 promoter did not fully eliminate PMA responsiveness in fibroblasts , to our knowledge this is the first report of AP-1 independent PMA-mediated collagenase-1 promoter induction in any cell type .
We detected no CAT activity in PMA-treated U937 cells transfected with either a -511 or -179 deletion construct containing the AP-1 mutation ( 26 ) .
Similarly , Jonat et al .
( 64 ) found no evidence of PMA-mediated induction of a -517/+63 collagenase-1 promoter fragment containing an AP-1 mutation when assayed in Hela cells .
Thus , the delayed AP-l-independent response is likely controlled by a regulatory element ( s ) upstream of position -517 .
While AP-1 factors are needed for the rapid and strong induction of collagenase-1 in U937 cells ( Fig .
3 ) , our data suggest that cooperation between distal upstream and downstream factors maintains gene expression over extended peri-ods .
We observed that collagenase-1 promoter activity was suppressed by sequences between -1954 and -179 ( Fig .
7 ) .
This suppression was not seen with p-2278CAT , p-2010CAT , and p-1197A-997CAT , nor was it seen with smaller constructs ( p-179CAT , p-95CAT , and p-72CAT ) .
Furthermore , the p-2010A-1954CAT internal deletion construct had diminished 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 11848 transcriptional activity relative to p-2278CAT .
Thus , we suggest that a suppressive element is located between -511 and -179 and that factors bound between -2010 and -1954 overcome this suppression to enhance AP-1 dependent responses .
Imai et al .
( 65 ) have proposed a model in fibroblasts in which the collagenase-1 promoter is brought into an active conformation by the interplay of regulatory factors which bind elements between -1705 and -1595 .
Similarly , we speculate that factors bound between -2010 and -1954 might help maintain collagenase-1 expression in PMA-differentiated U937 cells by interacting with downstream factors to overcome the potential inhibitory effect of the intervening sequences .
Heterologous promoter constructs p-2278TKCAT and p-2010TKCAT were stimulated by PMA differentiation of U937 cells independent of any downstream collagenase-1 AP-1 site , with the majority of this response lost once sequences -2010 to -1954 were deleted ( Fig .
8 ) .
The proserpine-binding site located at -1704 to -1689 ( 65 ) may function in monocytic cells because weak PMA responsiveness is lost when this sequence is deleted from heterologous promoter constructs ( Fig .
8 ) .
However , this effect is minimal compared with the decreased PMA responsiveness caused by deletion of sequences between -2010 and -1954 from heterologous promoter constructs .
Notably , no PMA responsiveness from heterologous constructs containing upstream collagenase-1 promoter regions was observed in HeLa cells ( 30 ) .
In the context of the wild-type collagenase-1 promoter , sequences between -2010 to -1954 were necessary to achieve maximal collagenase-1 promoter induction in U937 cells ( Fig .
7B ) .
In addition , deletion of this region caused decreased collagenase-1 promoter activity in untreated and PMA-differentiated U937 cells ( Fig .
7B ) .
In contrast , deletion of -2010 to -1954 did not decrease basal collagenase-1 promoter activity when assayed in fibroblasts ( 65 ) .
We identified a putative C/EBP-binding site ( -2006 to -1997 ) within this distal promoter region .
Importantly , C/EBP-B protein capable of binding this collagenase-1 promoter site is present in untreated U937 nuclear extracts , and levels are increased in PMA-differentiated U937 cells ( Figs .
9 and 10 ) .
Together , these data suggest that C/EBP-B may mediate , in part , the observed AP-1-independent activation and maintenance of collagenase-1 expression and specifically enhance AP-1 dependent responses in monocyte/macrophage cells .
The C/EBP family consists of five proteins ( « , B , 8 , y , and CRP-1 ) which are bZIP transcription factors that form homo-and heterodimers to bind the consensus sequence ( NT ( T/ G ) NNGNAA ( T/G ) ) ( 66 ) .
Although C/EBP-8 is found in many tissues ( 67 ) , it seems to play a prominent role in activating and regulating gene expression in monocytes and macrophages ( 59 , 68 , 69 ) .
C/EBP-B expression is induced during later stages of monocytic , but not granulocytic differentiation ( 69 ) , is consti-tutively low in monocyte/macrophages ( 68 , 70 ) , and is strongly stimulated in macrophages by inflammatory mediators , such as lipopolysaccharide ( 71 ) .
Therefore , C/EBP-B may be a necessary factor for normal monocyte/macrophage development and function .
Notably , C/EBP-8 , which forms heterodimers with C/EBP-B to synergistically activate transcription , is also strongly induced in monocytic cells by lipopolysaccharide ( 72 ) , an agent that potently stimulates collagenase-1 expression in macrophages ( 27 ) .
In addition , C/EBP-B and C/EBP-8 expression is stimulated or induced in various other tissues by inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 , interleukin-6 , and tumor necrosis factor-a ( 71 , 72 ) .
Thus , while our data suggest that C/EBP-B is involved in inducing collagenase-1 expression in monocytes , C/EBP-§ may also be involved in activating collagenase-1 transcription in other cell types once C/EBP -B expression has been induced by inflammatory factors .
