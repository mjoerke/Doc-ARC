Department of Dermatology , Hanyang University Hospital , Seoul , Korea Expression of nucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) kinase , which is homologous to the nm23 gene product in a variety of species , has been found to be inversely associated with metastatic potential However , the relationship remains controversial according to the tumor cell types and experimental system , with conflicting results from different research groups .
In order to determine whether NDP kinase expression serves as a marker for metastatic potential in human skin cancer , we assessed the levels of NDP kinase expression in 9 keratoacanthomas ( KAs ) 26 squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs ) , and 25 basal cell carcinomas ( BCCs ) using immunchistochemistry .
The expression of NDP kinase was intense in KA and SCC compared with BCC .
However , the difference of NDP kinase expression between KA and SCC was not statistically significant .
And there was no statistically significant difference in NDP kinase expression between SCC with metastasis and SCC without metastasis .
Our results contradict the hypothesis concerning the possible role of nm23 gene as a metastatic suppressor gene in human skin cancer .
The mechanism of overexpression in various tumor cell types and its biological significance in cutaneous carcinogenesis remain to be determined .

97 cantly greater nm23-RNA levels than related highly metastatic tumor cells ( Steeq and Liotta , 1990 ) .
Further evidence implicating nm23 in the control of metastatic murine melanoma cells transfected with nm23 gene demonstrated a significantly reduced metastatic ability independently of tumor cell growth ( Leone et al. , 1991 ) .
However , not all studies associate low nm23 gene expression with metastasis .
For example , in two studies of breast carcinoma , there was no significant association between lymph node 9 % stage and nm23 protein expression ( Sastre-Garau et al. , 1992 ; Sawan et al.,1994 ) .
Moreover , nm23 expression was associated with an increase in metas-tastic potential in two different murine melanoma cell lines ( Moris et al. , 1993 ) .
In human squamous neoplasm , Stephenson et al ( 1993 ) have examined the expression of nm23 product in keratoacanthoma ( KA ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) , since the former never metastasize while the latter have this potential .
They found that there was no statistically significant trend in tumor staining from KA through decreasing grades of differentiation of SCC .
However in this study , they considered only metastatic potential , which is directly related to degree of differentiation of SCC , rather than proven established metastasis .
Furthermore , to our knowledge , studies of the product level of the nm23 gene have not yet been carmied out in basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) , which is also known to metastasize very rarely .
We therefore performed an immunohistochemical analysis of NDP kinase expression in KA , SCC , and BCC using an affinity-purified monoclonal antibody raised in mice immunized with human NDP kinase A purified from erythrocytes to determine its correlation with metastatic potential .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Formalin-fixed _ and - paraffin-~embedded - tissue blocks from 60 biopsy specimens of skin cancer , which were well-preserved for immunohistochemical study were examined .
Nine patients had KA , 26 patients had SCC ( 12 cases without metastasis and 14 cases with metastasis ) , and 25 patients had BCC .
In addition , 3 normal subjects and 3 patients with psoriasis were studied as controls .
From each block , one section was cut for diagnostic review while the next two sections were mounted on poly-lysine-co-ated slides , air-dried and heated to 6°C for 20 minutes .
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.5 % HO » in methanol for 10 minutes .
Non-spe-cific antibody binding was blocked with normal rabbit serum for 10 minutes .
The primary antibody , an affinity-purified mouse monoclonal antibody to NDP kinase A ( Novocastra , U.K. ) was applied at a 1 : 200 dilution in Tris-buffered saline ( TBS , pH 7.6 ) for 60 minutes at room temperature .
Following two changes of TBS for 10 minutes the sections were covered with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin ( Dako , Y .
-S. Ro , S. -J. Jeong Denmark ) , diluted 1:500 , for 30 minutes .
Sections were then washed in two changes of TBS for 10 minutes .
This was followed by addition of the tertiary antibody , _ streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase _ complex ( Dako , Denmark ) applied for 30 minutes .
Sections were again washed in TBS for 10 minutes and developed with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate ( Zymed , USA ) .
Sections were counter stained with Mayer 's hematoxylin , cleaned , and mounted .
We included omission and substitution con-trols , and positive controls with breast adenocarcino-ma cases which we had previously found to give positive NDP kinase staining in each immunohistochemical batch .
Sections were reviewed by two independent observers with a conference microscope and graded as 1-4 corresponding respectively to less than 25 , 50 , 75 , and 100 % of tumor cells stained as described by Stephenson et al . ( 1993 ) .
Statistical analyses were carmied out using the chi-square test and Mann-Whitney 's U analysis .
Differences were taken as significant when P value was less than 0.05 .
RESULTS All omission and substitution controls were negative while the positive tissue controls gave uniform cytoplasmic staining .
The staining pattem of NDP kinase in tumor cells was generally much greater than that in normal skin .
In normal tissue samples , there was no or little NDP kinase expression with some exceptions ( Fig .
1A ) : sweat glands and their ducts , sebaceous glands , and some follicular epithelium often showed immunoreactivity for NDP kinase .
In psoriatic lesions , we observed the overexpression of NDP kinase comparable to that of KA which showed the highest levels of expression in the set of tumors that we analysed .
The 9 KA showed a mean staining grade of 2.56 and a mean median of 2.00 ( Fig .
1B ) ; for the 26 SCC the mean was 2.07 and the median was 2.00 ( Fig .
1C , 1D ) ; for the 25 BCC the mean was 1.40 and the median was 1.00 ( Fig .
1E ) .
The results are summarized in Table 1 .
Staining intensities of NDP kinase of KA , SCC , and BCC were compared to find if there are any statistically significant differences associated with metastatic potential .
Expression of NDP kinase was significantly less intense in BCC compared with those of KA and SCC ( p=0.0015 and p=0.0060 , respectively ) .

DISCUSSION The nm23 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 and encoded a 17 KD polypeptide ( Rosengard et al. , 1989 ) .
The predicted human nm23 protein has 78 % homology with the protein encoded by the developmentally regulated awd gene in Dro-sophila , mutation of which causes abnormal tissue morphology , - aberrant - differentiation , and necrosis ( Dearolf et al. , 1988 ; Rosengard et al. , 1989 ) .
A gene found in the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum encoding a NDP kinase is also highly homologous to both nm23 and awd ( Lacombe et al. , 1990 ; Wallet et al. , 1990 ) .
Recently , Stahl et al .
( 1991 ) described a second human nm23 gene designated nm23-H2 possessing 88 % homology with the gene originally described , thus now named nm23-H1 .
The identification of nm23 as an NDP kinase was recently definitively confirmed by demonstration of the identity of the primary structure of the NDP kinase A and NDP kinase B of human erythrocytes ( Gilles et al. , 1991 ) with the sequences deduced from nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 genes , respectively ( Rosengard et al. , 1989 ; Stahl et al. , 1991 ) .
Lacombe et al .
( 1991 ) demonstrated that the level and activity of NDP kinase were specifically increased in tumors of various origins as compared to normal tissues .
Consistent with this is our finding that NDP kinase was highly expressed in KA , SCC , and BCC compared with normal skin , which showed absent or lower expression .
On the contrary , in the study by Stephenson et al .
( 1993 ) where a polyclonal antibody to a synthetic nm23 peptide was used , adjacent normal epidermis and adnexal structures showed uniform intense cytoplasmic staining .
Similar results have been recorded in breast cancers .
In the study by Hirayama et al .
( 1991 ) and that of Sawan et al .
( 1994 ) where anti-rat and anti-human NDP kinase antibodies were utilized respectively , normal epithe-lum showed lower expression of NDP kinase compared with most tumors .
In contrast , Bames et al .
( 1991 ) found normal epithelium to have higher levels of expression using a polyclonal antibody to a Y .
-S. Ro , S. -J. Jeong synthetic nm 23 peptide .
These conflicting results suggest that the antibody specificities and functions may differ , thus recognizing different epitopes , although the expression of NDP kinase is now known to be identical to the nm23 gene product .
In this regard , the role of nm23 may not be due only to its NDP kinase activity .
Reduced expression of nm23/NDP kinase genes in tumor cells with highly metastatic characteristics has been reported in several experimental systems and certain types of human cancer such as breast cancer ( Bevilacqua et al. , 1989 ; Bames et al. , 1991 ; Hennessy et al. , 1991 ; Hirayama et al. , 1991 ) .
In the present study , in which we used an immunohistochemical technique with an antibody against purified NDP kinase A , we demonstrated that NDP kinase expression did not significantly differ between KA and SCC .
Given the fact that the former never metastasize while the latter have this potential , our results contradict the hypothesis concerning the possible role of NDP kinase .
These findings are in keeping with the results of Stephenson et al .
( 1993 ) who reported that there was no significant trend in tumor staining from KA through decreasing grades of differentiation of SCC .
Furthermore , we could not find any statistically significant difference of NDP kinase expression between SCC without metastasis and SCC with metastasis .
The reasons for the discrepancies between these results and other studies reporting an association between low expression of the nm23 gene and high metastatic potential are not clear at present .
However , it should be noted that we have measured the protein level - using - immunohistochemical - technique - with monoclonal antibody against the purified protein , whereas most of the preceding studies have relied on RNA detection .
It is known that the NDP kinase has higher metabolic stability and therefore , a decrease in mRNA might not be reflected at the protein level .
Sawan et al .
( 1994 ) have also demonstrated the weakness of the correlation between the data of immunohistochemical analysis for NDP kinase and the nm23 mRNA - levels , - resulting - in many mRNA-negative cases scored positive by immunohistochemistry .
Currently , the expression of nm23 mRNA evaluated by either Northern blot analysis or in situ hybridization is shown to be associated with low metastatic potential in several types of human cancer , including colon ( Cohn et al. , 1991 ) and breast carcinoma ( Bevilacqua et al. , 1989 ; Hennessy et al. , 1991 ) .
A similar correlation between nm23 mRNA expression and tumor nm23 and human skin cancers aggressiveness was also found in malignant melanoma of human skin ( Florenes et al. , 1992 ) .
However , not all studies associate low nm23 mRNA levels with tumor - metastasis .
In neuroblastomas , aggressive tumors showed higher levels of nm23 mRNA with n-mye gene amplification , and it has been proposed that nm23 molecular alterations , rather than its reduced expression , can be associated with tumor aggressiveness ( Hailat et al. , 1991 ) .
In colonic cancer , in contrast to the evidence of nm23 allelic gene deletions in aggressive cases , Haut et al .
( 1991 ) failed to observe a similar association between nm23 mRNA and metastasis .
Since the results of the studies which have measured nm23 mRNA levels as a marker for metastatic potential were also at variance , these findings are believed to be a consequence of tissue-spe-cific phenomenon rather than the validity of the methodology of nm23 expression measurement .
The precise biologic function of nm23/NDP kinase is still unknown : as NDP kinase is important in providing nucleoside triphosphates required for RNA and DNA synthesis , an increase in NDP kinase expression and activity could correlate with hyperproliferation .
Indeed , we observed the overexpression of NDP kinase in psoriasis , which might indicate a correlation with the proliferative state .
Recently , Keim et al .
( 1992 ) also reported that peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated .
with - phytohemagglutinin showed high levels of nm23 expression .
These observations would suggest involvement of nm23 in normal and malignant proliferation that is distinct from its proposed role as a tumor metastasis suppressor .
In conclusion , our data suggest that the level of NDP kinase , the product of the nm23 gene , increases in the set of skin tumors that we have analysed , but can not be considered a biological marker of metastatic potential .
Further investigation is required to determine the differential role of nm23 and NDP kinase in cutaneous carcinogenesis , to characterize the mechanism of overexpression and its relation to cellular proliferation , and to elucidate the biological significance of nm23/NDP kinase in different cell types .
