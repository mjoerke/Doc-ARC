Upregulation of c-Fos in Activated T Lymphoid and Monocytic Cells by Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Tat Protein By Davide Gibellini , Antonella Caputo , Silvano Capitani , Michele La Placa , and Giorgio Zauli The regulatory Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) is essential for viral replication and also shows pleiotropic activities on various cell functions .
To get further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of Tat , we investigated the effect of endogenous and exogenous Tat protein on c-fos gene expression in T lymphoblastoid ( Jurkat ) and monocytic ( U937 ) cell lines , as well as in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .
Transient cotransfection of tat cDNA in sense orientation ( tat/S ) , together with a plasmid containing the c-fos promoter ( FC3 , from -711 to +42 ) in front of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene significantly enhanced CAT activity in Jurkat cells activated by the addition of 15 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) or 5 mg/ml phytohemagglutinin plus 10~ ' mol/L phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and U937 cells activated by 15 % FCS or 10~ ' mol/L PMA .
This effect was specifically due to Tat , since Jurkat and U937 cells cotransfected either with tat cDNA in antisense orientation ( fat/AS } ) , tat carrying a mutation in the aminoacid cys '' - gly '' ( fat /S ) or with the backbone vector alone ( pRPneo-SL3 ) did not show any significant difference in c-fos promoter activity as compared to cells transfected with HE HUMAN immunodeficiency virus-type 1 ( HIV-1 ) 86-101 amino acid Tat protein is encoded by two exons and comprises five distinct domains : namely the N-terminal , cysteine-rich , core , basic , and C-terminal sequences . ''
The cysteine-rich region is responsible for the formation of intra-molecular disulphide bonds , '' whereas the basic region contains nuclear localization signals® and the binding site for the transactivation response element ( TAR ) .
* The transcriptional activation domain of Tat ( amino acids 1 through 48 ) includes the amino-terminal region , the conserved cysteine-rich and core domains . ''
Tat plays a pivotal role for HIV-1 gene expression and replication , '' by interacting with the TAR sequence , located at the 5 ' end of all viral mRNAs .
However , increasing experimental evidence suggests that Tat can also control viral replication via TAR-independent mecha-nisms . ''
Besides its transactivating function on viral gene expression , Tat affects the survival , growth , and function of a variety of infected and uninfected cells .
* '' '' These biological effects are at least partially mediated by the upregulation or downregulation of genes involved in the control of cell sur-vival/proliferation'* '' * '' or coding for cytokines . ''

By using deletion mutants of the c-fos promoter , we found that the minimal DNA sequence required for Tat activity was located between nucleotides -404/-220 and that the serum responsive element ( SRE , -317/-288 ) , present within this region , was still responsive to Tat .
A single point mutation in the SRE completely abrogated the responsiveness to fat/S .
Exogenous recombinant Tat protein was also able to upregulate c-fos promoter activity in serum-activated Jurkat and U937 cells , as well as endogenous c-fos mRNA expression and c-Fos protein synthesis in both serum-activated cell lines and primary PBMC .
c-Fos protein was shown essential for an optimal transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) by Tat : incubation of Jurkat cells with antisense , but not sense , c-fos oligonucleotides significantly reduced either the Tat-enhanced expression of an LTR-CAT reporter construct or the levels of gag p24 in the culture supernatants of Jurkat cells and PBMC acutely infected with HIV-1 .
Our data suggest that the c-fos upregulation mediated by Tat might play a significant role in the control of viral gene transactivation .

Moreover , the addition of an anti-Tat neutralizing antibody in culture blocks an autocrine/paracrine loop of extracellular Tat in fat-transfected cell lines , '' '' and reduces the levels of gag p24 in the culture supernatant of HIV-1 infected lymphoid T-cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) .
`` **° These findings add further complexity to the mechanisms of action of Tat protein , strongly suggesting that extracellular Tat may also significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease .
It is noteworthy that c-Fos-responsive sequence motifs have been identified in HIV-1 LTR , '' as well as in many promoters of genes encoding for cytokines transactivated by Tat . ''
In this study , we investigated whether Tat is able to modulate c-Fos protein expression as a part of its mechanism of action .
To do this , we selected as model systems the Jurkat human CD4* T and the U937 monocytic cell lines , which are representative of the main targets of HIV-1 infection in vivo . ''
Induction of the c-fos gene promoter , c-fos mRNA expression and c-Fos protein synthesis were evaluated in both cell lines , either ( 1 ) transiently transfected with tat cDNA , or ( 2 ) treated with recombinant Tat protein , whether alone or in combination with various stimuli known to activate c-fos expression .
The effect of extracellular Tat on endogenous c-fos gene expression was also evaluated on primary PBMCs .
Finally , to evaluate the physiological relevance of these results to HIV-1 infection , we performed experiments in which antisense and sense c-fos oligonucleotides were added to Jurkat cells either transfected with fat cDNA plus constructs containing the LTR region of HIV1 genome fused with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) , or acutely infected with the IIIB strain of HIV-1 .

SOF-OLIGO and FOS-OLIGO were added at a final concentration of 25 umol/L at the beginning of culture .
Every other day , cultures were demi-populated and supplemented with 0.5 mL of fresh medium containing 25 pmol/ L of oligonucleotides .
The harvested medium was centrifuged and the supernatants were monitored for the presence of gag p24 antigen by means of a commercial immunoplate assay ( Du Pont de Nemours , Les Ulis , France ) , while cell pellet was resuspended and viable cells were counted by Trypan blue dye exclusion .

Two-tailed Student 's test for unpaired data was used for statistical comparison .
RESULTS HIV-1 Tat specifically upregulates c-fos promoter activity in serum-stimulated Jurkat and U937 cells .
- Since Tat protein is predominantly produced during the early phases of de novo HIV-1 infection or during reactivation from viral latency , '' the effect of Tat on the c-fos promoter expression was first examined in transient transfection experiments .
Jurkat and U937 cell lines were cotransfected with the FC3 plasmid , where CAT gene expression is driven by the c-fos promoter , together with an HIV-1 fat expression plasmid ( tat/S ) .
Control samples were represented by cells transfected with the FC3 plasmid alone as well as cells cotransfected with FC3 and a fat antisense plasmid tat carrying a mutation in the amino acid cys* '' - gly '' ( fat /S ) or FC3 and the pRPneo-SL3 backbone vector .
When Jurkat or U937 cells were cultured in the presence of low serum concentrations ( RPMI + 1 % FCS ) , Tat was unable to upregulate CAT activity over the levels observed in the presence of control vectors ( data not shown ) .
The effect of Tat expression was then evaluated in the presence of additional stimuli : 15 % FCS or PHA ( 5 pg/mL ) + 10~ ' mol/L PMA for Jurkat , 15 % FCS , or 10~ ' mol/L PMA for U937 cells .
Under these conditions , CAT activity showed a fivefold to sevenfold increase ( P < .01 ) in both Jurkat ( Fig 1A ) and U937 ( Fig 1B ) cells cotransfected with tat/S as compared to cells cotransfected with faW/AS , tat `` /S , pRPneo-SL3 or cells transfected with FC3 alone .
The enhancing effect of tat/S on FC3 activity was promoter specific , as Tat did not significantly upregulate CAT expression when the reporter CAT gene was under the transcriptional control of the B-actin promoter ( G-actin/CAT ) ( data not shown ) .
To provide an additional proof that the increased c-fos promoter activity was specifically mediated by Tat , transient cotransfection assays were performed with fat/S , tat/AS , and FC3 vectors in both Jurkat and U937 cell lines cultured in the presence of 15 % FCS .
fat/AS significantly ( P < .01 ) reduced the activation of FC3 mediated by fat/S in both Jurkat ( Fig 2A ) and U937 ( Fig 2B ) cells from fivefold-sev-enfold to twofold-threefold .
Moreover , to exclude the possibility that Tat activates the transcription of the CAT gene in an unusual start site , RNase protection analysis was performed using an RNA probe complementary to the CAT gene ( Fig 3 ) .
After RNase digestion , the protected fragment resulted of 310 nucleotides as expected .

The -317/-288 serum responsive element of the c-fos promoter is required for Tat transactivation in activated Jurkat cells .
In the next series of cotransfection assays we used different 5 ' deletion mutants of the c-fos promoter linked to the CAT gene ( Fig 4A and B ) together with tat expressing vectors , to determine which sequences of the c-fos promoter were required for Tat function .
Figure 4C shows the CAT analysis in Jurkat cells cultured in 15 % FCS after cotransfection with various c-fos promoter/CAT deletion mutants plus 1at/S or tat/AS .
In the presence of FC2 , FC3 , and FC4 plasmids , tat was able to significantly enhance CAT activity with respect to fat/AS , whereas tat/S was unable to activate CAT expression from the FC8 mutant over the level achieved in the presence of fat/AS .

fos promoter sequences located between positions -404 and -220 bp .
In this region , different cis-acting regulatory elements exist ( Fig 4A ) which may be responsible for the transactivation activity mediated by Tat .
In fact , this 184 bp region contains multiple promoter elements including the dyad symmetry element that encompasses the SRE , an AP-1 site , the platelet-derived growth factor responsive sequence , a CRE element and an E1A-inducible region . '' ''
Since it has previously been shown that the SRE is essential for the transactivation of c-fos mediated by transactivating Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) , '' in the next series of experiments , we cotransfected tat/S and tat/AS with plasmids containing the wild-type SRE in front of CAT ( Fig 4B and C ) .
Tat significantly activated the SRE/CAT plasmid ( a threefold increase of CAT activity with respect to fat/AS ) , although to a lesser extent than FC3 ( a fivefold to sevenfold increase ) .
On the other hand , 1a # /S was unable to stimulate CAT activity when an SRE mutated was used ( data not shown ) .
These data suggest that a functional wild-type SRE 1657 was involved in the Tat-mediated transactivation of the c-fos promoter .
Extracellular recombinant Tat is able to upregulate c-fos promoter activity and induce nuclear c-Fos accumulation in both Jurkat cells and primary PBMC .
It has been well-documented that Tat can be secreted in a biologically active form either by acutely infected cells or by fat-transfected cell lines , and be taken up by neighboring uninfected cells , thus contributing to the transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR and heterologous cellular gene promoters .
To test the effect of extracellular Tat protein on the activity of the c-fos promoter , recombinant Tat or p24 were added to Jurkat and U937 cells 12-hours posttransfection with FC3 , and cultures were allowed to procede for an additional 24 hours .
As shown in Fig 5 , CAT activity was significantly ( P < .01 ) enhanced by the addition of recombinant Tat but not by recombinant p24 .
Moreover , Tat activity was specifically neutralized by an anti-Tat MoAb .
These results indicate that also in its extracellular form Tat was able to upregulate the activity of the c-fos promoter .
An episomial c-fos promoter/CAT fusion construct differs from the endogenous c-fos gene with respect to the conformation and sequences of the flanking DNA .
Therefore , in the next group of experiments we evaluated the effect of extracellular Tat on endogenous c-fos gene expression in Jurkat cells .
Northern blot analysis showed that the endogenous c-fos mRNA expression was markedly higher in Jurkat treated with 15 % FCS plus recombinant Tat as compared to cells treated with 15 % FCS alone or 15 % FCS plus recombinant p24 ( Fig 6 ) .
The enhancing effect mediated by Tat on c-fos mRNA was specifically blocked by an anti-Tat neutralizing antibody .
In parallel experiments , the amount of c-Fos protein was then evaluated by flow cytometry ( Fig 7A through N ) in both serum-starved Jurkat and freshly isolated PBMC treated with the same agonists described above for the c-fos mRNA studies .
PBMC were examined taking into account that primary T cells and monocytes differ from tumor cell lines in growth control and requirement for growth factors .
The flow cytometry approach was chosen , since it has been previously e Fig 3 .

c-Fos protein was first examined in 24-hour serum-starved Jurkat cells ( Fig 7A and D ) and freshly isolated PBMC ( Fig 7G and L ) .
The level of c-Fos protein significantly increased in both Jurkat and PBMC ( Fig 7B and H ) after a 45-minute treatment with 15 % FCS or PHA plus PMA ( Fig 7E and M ) and showed a further increase when recombinant Tat was added to 15 % FCS or PHA plus PMA ( Fig 7C , F , I , and N ) .
The presence of c-Fos protein was also analyzed in Jurkat cells by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy ( Fig 8A , B , and C ) .
While Jurkat showed weak or absent staining after 24 hours of serum starvation ( Fig 8A ) , the addition of 15 % FCS for 45 minutes induced an intense as means + SDs of four independent transfection experiments performed in duplicate .

Addition of antisense c-fos oligonucleotides in culture diminishes the Tat-mediated transactivation activity on HIV1 LTR and the gag p24 levels in the culture supernatants of acutely IIIB infected Jurkat cells and PBMC .
| The experiments described thus far suggested that Tat protein was able to upregulate c-Fos nuclear protein in both T lymphoid and monocytic cells .
If this elevation in c-Fos protein is relevant to the ability of Tat to transactivate HIV-1 LTR , preventing this increase in c-fos expression should diminish the expression of HIV-1 LTR and be detrimental for a productive viral infection .

by integrin-derived signals .
* '' Accordingly , we used synthetic DNA oligonucleotides that were complementary to c-fos mRNA sequences ( antisense c-fos oligonucleotides , SOF-OLIGO ) or identical to c-fos mRNA sequences ( sense c-fos oligonucleotides , FOS-OLIGO ) , introducing them by along with 1at/S and an LTR-CAT construct .
When cultures were kept in 15 % FCS for the last 24 hours , transfection of Jurkat with SOF-OLIGO but not with FOS-OLIGO markedly decreased the expression of HIV-1 LTR in the presence of ( Fig 9 ) .
On the other hand , no significant differences in the levels of LTR-CAT activity were observed when cultures were kept for 36 hours in 1 % FCS after transfection ( data not shown ) .
These results suggested that c-Fos protein is involved in the Tat-mediated regulation of HIV-1 LTR .
On the other hand , activation of LTR-CAT in the absence of fat expression was very low and did not allow to establish whether c-Fos was also involved in the basal HIV-1 LTR-CAT transcription .
We then analyzed the levels of gag p24 antigen in the culture supernatants of Jurkat ( Fig 10A ) or PBMC ( Fig 10B ) acutely infected with high doses of infectious HIV ( IIIB ) and continously supplemented with SOF- and FOS-OLIGO .
The addition of SOF-OLIGO but not FOS-OLIGO to cultures caused a specific decrease of the gag 24 levels evaluated over a 15-day culture period in either Jurkat cells or PBMC .
This effect was not due to a toxic effect of SOF-OLIGO , since the number of viable cells did not significantly change in Jurkat cells that were left untreated with respect to cells treated with SOF- or FOS-OLIGO ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION The c-Fos protein is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex and is a member of a multigene family , including the fos-related ( fos B , fra-1 , fra-2 ) and jun-related ( c-jun , jun B , jun D ) genes .
The AP-1 binding site is recog- 1659 nized by dimeric protein complexes composed of Jun homo-dimers or Fos/Jun heterodimers .
The Fos/Jun heterodimer complex shows greater affinity than Jun/Jun homodimer for the AP-1 binding site . '' ''
`` ' Moreover , c-Fos protein can also heterodimerize with some components of the NF-kB '' or ATFE/CREB® '' families , thus allowing a cross-talk between different transduction pathways , and providing an important route for different intracellular signals to be integrated at the level of transcriptional control .
Our data indicate that the transactivator Tat protein of HIV-1 upregulates c-fos gene expression in both activated Jurkat and U937 cell lines , as well as in freshly isolated activated PBMC .
The effects of Tat on promoter activity , mRNA expression and protein synthesis suggested that c-fos upregulation was primarily caused at the transcriptional level .
Moreover , the structural integrity of the activation domain of Tat was required for the promotion of the c-fos promoter in both Jurkat and U937 cells , since a single mutation in the aminoacid cys* was sufficient to completely block the upregulation of c-fos expression .
Since the mutation in cys '' results in the complete loss of the transactivating activity of Tat on HIV-1 LTR , * our findings suggest that Tat-mediated activation of the c-fos promoter and the HIV-1 LTR are likely dependent on the same Tat function .

2 gene mediated by Tat , '' we found out that the transient expression of tat was unable in itself to enhance c-fos expression in either tumoral or primary unstimulated cells ; however , Tat significantly improved the effect of other stimuli such as high serum concentrations .
Experiments performed with c-fos promoter deletion mutants indicated that the responsive region required for Tat activity was set between -404 and -220 bp and that the SRE was critical for Tat transactivation .
Interestingly , the c-fos activation mediated by Tat revealed both clear differences and definite similarities with the c-fos transactivation induced by the transactivating Tax protein of HTLV-1 . ''
Both transactivators synergized with high serum concentra-tions , PHA or PMA in stimulating c-fos gene expression .
Moreover , the analysis of deletion mutants underlined the central role of SRE in the transactivation activity of both Tat and Tax .
However , Tax is a stronger inducer of c-fos expression , as it is able to transactivate c-fos promoter even in the presence of a low serum concentration .
The mechanism by which Tat affects c-fos gene expression remains to be fully elucidated .
Bulge ( AUCUG ) and stem-loop ( CUGGGA ) structures similar to the Tat-binding site on HIV-1 LTR RNA have been identified downstream of the transcriptional start site of the tumor necrosis factor-B '' and JC virus '' '' promoters , and have been implicated in the Tat-induced activation of these genes .
However , sequence comparison of the c-fos mRNA and TAR revealed no similarities between the TAR region of LTR and c-fos mRNA .
Similarly , other authors failed show the presence of stem-loop sequences in different cellular genes activated by Tat . ''
* '' Therefore , the transactivation of c-fos gene expression may be the consequence of a TAR-independent mechanism of transcriptional activation mediated by Tat .
Moreover , the ability of Tat to enhance c-fos transcription only when additional stimuli are present , suggests a primary role in elongation and transcription processivity rather than in the transcription initiation of c-fos gene , as previously described for the HIV-1 LTR .
It is remarkable that even in its extracellular form Tat was able to upregulate c-fos expression in activated primary and tumoral cells .
The effect of extracellular Tat may imply the uptake and nuclear localization of Tat protein , '' '' which may From UPREGULATION OF C-FOS BY TAT Fig 8 .

1661 act directly on c-fos promoter .
Alternatively , extracellular Tat might trigger an intracellular signal transduction pathway after specific membrane interactions with different types of integrin receptors present on those cells sensitive to its biological activity . '' '' '' '' '' ''
A similar mechanism has been proposed to explain the Tat-induced proliferation of Kaposi 's sarcoma spindle cells and normal endothelial cells preacti-vated by cytokines . ''
If this model is correct , extracellular Tat could mimic the effect of extracellular matrix proteins activating c-fos expression through an intracellular signal cascade . ''
Our data indicate that c-Fos induction by Tat may have a role in the activation of HIV-1 LTR .
In fact , SOF-OLIGO significantly inhibited CAT activity in both Jurkat and U937 cells transiently transfected with tat/S and an LTR-CAT reporter plasmid , and were able to specifically decrease the gag p24 levels in the culture supernatants of either Jurkat cells or primary PBMC acutely infected with HIV-1 .
The upregulation of c-Fos induced by Tat may influence HIV-1 genome expression and HIV-1 replication in several ways .
Firstly , the activation of c-Fos contributes to cell cycle progression of hematopoietic cells , acting throughout all the phases of the cell cycle . '' ''
In this respect , it has been established that HIV-1 infects more efficiently activated cells than the quiescent ones . ''
Secondly , transcriptional studies of the HIV-1 genome have shown that the HIV-1 LTR promoter can be subdivided into three functional domains : a basal core promoter , which is made up by the transcriptional start site , a TATA box , and three tandem Spl binding sites ( GC-boxes ) ; an upstream enhancer element containing two adjacent binding sites for nuclear factor < B ( NFkB ) ; a far upstream modulatory region . ''
The HIV-1 LTR promoter also contains AP-1 motifs both upstream ' and downstream '' of the transcriptional start site .
These AP-1 sites can function independently of or in concert with the enhancer to activate HIV-1 transcription .

the AP-1 and NF-kB families of transcription factors has recently been described . ''
In conclusion , we have clearly shown that HIV-1 transactivating Tat protein upregulates the expression of c-fos gene and the enhanced c-Fos protein production may represent an important intermediate step for the Tat-dependent HIV-1 genome transactivation .
In the light of the positive synergy between NF- « B p65 and c-Fos , the ability of Tat to stimulate both factors has important implications for the promotion of viral replication , and , possibly , for the control of both immune and inflammatory responses through the production of various cytokines .
In an evolutionary perspective , it may provide the virus with a mechanism to broaden its LTR response to extracellular stimuli and activate viral gene transcription under a wide variety of cellular conditions .
Functional redundancy is a common feature of viral as well as cellular regulatory regions and in this case it may represent a mechanism to increase virus host range and virus replication potentiality .
