During inflammatory reactions , many oxidative species are produced , one of which is hypochlorous acid ( HOCI ) , which is responsible for the microbicidal effects of activated human polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes .
Treatment of a T-lymphocytic cell line with micromolar concentrations of HOC ] promoted the appearance of transcription factor NF- « B ( the heterodimer p50/p65 ) in the nucleus of the cells , even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis .
Western blot analysis of the NF- « B inhibitory subunits ( IxB ) demonstrated that both IxB- « proteolysis and p105 processing were induced by the treatment .
NF- « B activation was very effective when cells were subjected to hyperthermia before being treated with HOC .
Various antioxidants , such as pyrr-olidine dithiocarbamate , p-bromophenacyl-bromide and nordihydroguaiaretic acid could strongly reduce NF-KB translocation , demonstrating the importance of oxidative species in the transduction mechanism .
Moreover , ACH-2 cells treated with HOC ] or H , O , released tumour necrosis factor- « ( TNF- « ) in the supernatants .
The importance of TNF-z release in NF- « B induction by HOC or H , O , was demonstrated by the fact that : ( 1 ) the nuclear appearance of NF- « B was promoted in untreated cells ; and ( 2 ) synergism between TNF-a and HOC ] was detected .
Collectively , these results suggest that HOC ] should be considered as an oxidative species capable of inducing NF- « B in a T-lymphocytic cell line through a transduction mechanism involving ROS , and having a long-distance effect through subsequent TNF- @ release .
INTRODUCTION One of the key experimental results concerning the role of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in gene expression is the elucidation of the mode of action of the NF- « B protein complex as a transcriptional factor [ 1 ] ( for reviews see [ 2-4 ] ) .
NF- « B is composed of a number of proteins related to the proto-oncogene c-rel ( reviewed in [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] ) .
These proteins are ( p50 ) , NF- « B2 ( p52 ) , c-Rel , Rel A ( p65 ) and Rel B [ 7-10 ] .
The different NF- « B proteins associate to form a variety of homo-and hetero-dimers , which interact with a series of related DNA target sites , collectively called NF- « B sites [ 11 ] .
Most of the dimeric NF- « B complexes are stored in the cytoplasm of non-stimulated cells as inactive complexes , as a result of interaction with a group of inhibitory proteins , collectively known as IB [ 12 ] .
NF- « B1 and NF- « B2 are initially synthesized as large precursors of 105 and 100 kDa in size respectively [ 13-15 ] .
These precursors do not bind DNA , but they can interact with other Rel-related proteins and function in an IxB-like fashion by sequestering various Rel-related protein homo- and hetero-dimers in the cytoplasm [ 16,17 ] .
Proteolytic degradation of the p105 and p100 precursors leads to the production of mature DNA-binding subunits and the release of the active Rel-related protein dimers containing p50 and p52 respectively .
The rate of processing of both precursors appears to be regulated and can be increased in response to extracellular stimuli [ 16 ] .
Submitting T-lymphocytes to oxidative stress , as mimicked by the addition of extracellular H,0 , , induces the nuclear appearance and DNA-binding activity of NF- « B [ 1 ] , followed by transcriptional activation of the proviral DNA in cells non-productively infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) [ 18 ] .
Presumably , the mechanism involves passive diffusion of H , O , through the cell membrane .
There , it indirectly triggers the controlled proteolytic degradation of IxB molecules [ 19,20 ] .
The transduction mechanism leading to NF- « B translocation is still poorly understood , but seems to implicate a series of kinases , such as the T-cell tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 [ 21 ] , which is responsive to H,0 , treatment and requires the expression of CD3 for the response .
Moreover , ZAP-70 is known to associate with the £ and e chains of the T-cell receptor after treatment with H,0 , [ 22,23 ] .
Phagocytic cells produce a number of ROS , all derived from the reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide anion catalysed by an NADPH oxidase ( see [ 24 ] for review ) .
Neutrophils ( polymorphonuclear cells ) and eosinophils , but not mature macrophages , upon stimulation release myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) into phagolysosomes or into the extracellular medium [ 25 ] .
MPO from neutrophils catalyses the reaction of H , O with CI ions to produce hypochlorous acid ( HOC ) , whereas the eosinophil MPO preferentially uses Br , ions even though the CI ion concentration is 1000-fold higher in plasma [ 26 ] .
HOC can react with amines to produce chloramines and N-chlorinated derivatives which have long lifetimes in plasma [ 27 ] .
Thus , MPO-generated HOC and N-chloramines may represent the most Abbreviations used : BPB , p-bromophenacyl-bromide ; DTT , dithiothreitol ; HIV-1 , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ; IL-1 , PLA2 , phospholipase AZ ; ROS , reactive oxygen species ; TNF-a , tumour necrosis factor- « ; PMA , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; MPO , myeloperoxidase ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ; CHX , cycloheximide ; PDTC , pyrrolidinge-dithiocarbamate ; EASIA , enzyme amplified sensitivity immunoassay .

7178 S. Schoonbroodt and others important oxidants produced by activated neutrophils , and there is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that they play an important role in inflammation as well as in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases [ 28 ] .
Since it is now clearly established that micromolar concentrations of H , O , can modulate cell function through the activation of cellular transcription factors ( see [ 2 ] and [ 29 ] for reviews ) , we decided to investigate whether low concentrations of HOC ] can function as a mediator in cell activation , with special emphasis on the NF- « B transcription factor , which is redox regulated .
In this paper , it is shown , for the first time , that an important oxidant such as HOC ] can , with a slow kinetic rate , also induce NF- « B heterodimer p50/p65 in a T-lymphocytic cell line through proteolysis of IxB- « and p105 inhibitors .
In addition , it is shown that HOC contributes to the release of tumour necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) in cell supernatants capable of propagating activation to non-induced cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and reagents The ACH-2 T-lymphocytic cell line was obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program ( Bethesda , MD , U.S.A. ) , and cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 + Glutamax I with 10 % ( v/v ) fetal calf serum , 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin ( all from Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD , U.S.A. ) .
Cells were seeded in fresh medium 12-24 h before any experiment .
Chemicals All chemicals were of reagent grade and were obtained from UCB ( Brussels , Belgium ) or from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO , U.S.A. ) .
NaCIO was purchased from Aldrich ( Brussels , Belgium ) and was used to generate hypochlorous acid ( HOC ] ) by adjusting the pH to 6.85 with diluted H , SO , immediately before use .
HOC concentrations were determined using a molar absorption coefficient of 100 at 235 nm [ 30 ] .
At pH 6.85 , HOC ] is partly ionized to hypochlorite anion , CIO , at a ratio of HOCI/CIO-~ of x 1.8:1 .
Generation of oxidative stress ACH-2 cells , at 6 x 10° per ml of culture medium , were cultivated in 25cm '' culture flasks before being treated with HOC ] ( 0-500 LM ) .
Before treatment with HOC ] , cells were collected by centrifugation and resupended at the same concentration in the medium without fetal calf serum .
At 30 min after HOC ] addition , ACH-2 cells were refed with 10 % ( v/v ) fetal calf serum , and ( 4-5 ) x 10° cells were subsequently harvested at various times ( between 30 and 180 min ) for NF- « B electrophoretic mobility-shift analysis .
After 48 h , ACH-2 cells were counted and cytotoxicity was estimated using Trypan Blue exclusion .
Nuclear protein extraction The method used for the extraction of nuclear proteins is described elsewhere [ 31 ] .
Briefly , at various times after the oxidative stress , ( 3-5 ) x 10° ACH-2 cells were washed in 1 ml of cold PBS and centrifuged at 15000 g for 15 s , resuspended in 100-400 wl of cold hypotonic buffer [ 10 mM Hepes/KOH/2 mM MgC1 , /0.1 mMEDTA/10 mMKCl/1 mM dithiothreitol { DTT ) / 0.5 mM PMSF ( pH 7.9 ) ] , left on ice for 10 min , then vortexed and centrifuged at 15000 g for 30 s. Aliquots of supernatant , containing the cytoplasmic proteins , were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C .
The pellets of nuclei were gently resuspended in 15 wl of cold saline buffer [ 50 mM Hepes/KOH/50 mM KCI1/300 mM NaCl mM EDTA/10 % ( w /v ) glycerol /1 mM DTT/0.5 mM PMSF ( pH 7.9 ) ] and left for 20 min on ice .
After centrifugation ( 15000 g for 5 min at 4 °C ) , aliquots of supernatant , containing the nuclear proteins , were kept in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C .
Protein concentrations were measured with the bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) kit supplied by Pierce ( Rockford , IL , U.S.A. ) .
Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ( EMSA ) The EMSA method used is that described in [ 32 ] , with slight modifications .
Briefly , 5 ug of nuclear proteins were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.2 ng of **P-labelled oligonucleotidic probe , 1 ug of BSA and 1.25 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) - poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia Biotech Benelux , Rozendaal , The Netherlands ) in 20 mM Hepes/KOH/75 mM NaCl/1 mM EDTA/5 % ( v/v ) glycerol mM MgCl , /1 mM DTT ( pH 7.9 ) buffer ( final volume 10 wl ) .
DNA-protein complexes were then resolved on a non-denaturing 6 % polyacrylamide ( 4 % for supershifts ) gel run for 4 h at 180 V in TBE { 0.5 x [ 2.5 mM Tris/2.5 mM H , BO , /2 mM EDTA ( pH 8.5 ) ] } .
The gel was then dried and autoradiographed on a Fuji X-ray film ( General Electrics , Antwerp , Belgium ) .
For competition experiments , unlabelled probe ( wild type or mutated ) was added in excess ( 50x ) in the binding buffer .
The oligonucleotide probe ( Eurogentec , Seraing , Belgium ) was labelled by infilling with the Klenow DNA polymerase ( Bochringer , Mannheim , Germany ) as described elsewhere [ 32 ] .
Probe ( 100 ng ) was labelled with 3 4yCi of [ « - '' °P ] dATP and [ « -**P ] dCTP ( 3000 Ci/mmol ; Du Pont De Nemours International , Brussels , Belgium ) and unlabelled dTTP and dGTP ( Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) , then purified on a Sephadex G-25 ( Pharmacia Biotech Benelux ) column and stored at -20 °C until use .
Specific radioactivity was always > 10° c.p.m./ug .

ACH-2 cells were then maintained at 42°C for 40 min before being slowly cooled down to 37 °C within 30 min .
At each time point during the various phases , aliquots of ( 4-5 ) x 10° cells were taken for NF- « B assay .
ACH-2 cells in culture medium made hyperthermic following this procedure were then subjected to an oxidative stress mediated by HOC ] ( 100-300 LM ) .
Between 30 and 180 min after treatment with HOC ] , nuclear extracts were prepared for NF- « B analysis .
NF-KB activation by hypochlorous acid 779 Exposure of ACH-2 cells to TNF- « before HOCI TNF-a ( Boehringer , Germany ) ( 0-1000 units/ml ) was directly added to complete media , using 0.6 x 10° ACH-2 cells per ml of growth medium .
At 90 min after treatment with TNF-a , ACH-2 cells were subjected to an oxidative stress mediated by HOC ] ( 100-300 zM ) , and 3 h later nuclear extracts were prepared for NF- « B analysis .
Western blotting The IkB-a subunit , p65 and p105-p50 were detected by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies .
Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared at various times after HOCl-mediated treatment by hypotonic lysis , pelleting of the nuclei and collection of the supernatant fraction [ 32 ] .
Cytoplasmic proteins were added to a loading buffer [ 10 mM Tris/HCl ( pH 6.8 ) /1 % ( w/v ) SDS $ /25 % ( v/v ) glycerol/0.1 mM 2-mercaptocthanol/0.03 % ( w/v ) Brom-ophenol Blue ] , boiled and electrophoresed on a 10 % -polyacrylamide gel and electro-transferred to Immobilon-P membranes ( Millipore , Bedford , MA , U.S.A. ) .
Filters were incubated in primary antibody for 60 min at 37°C ( 1:2000 dilution ) and in peroxidase-comjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG ( 1 : 250 dilution ) for 60 min at 37 °C , and finally analysed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system ( ECL ; Amersham , Slough , U.K. ) using Fuji X-ray films .
TNF- « and ( IL-1/ ) detection The release of TNF- « or IL-1 } in cell supernatants taken from ACH-2 cells , pretreated with either 100 4M H , O , or 200 gM HOC ] , was quantitatively assayed by immunoassays [ TNF- « and IL-1 # enzyme amplified sensitivity immunoassay ( EASIA ) , Medgenix , Fleurus , Belgium ] .
Cytokine measurements were performed in triplicate , and values were directly compared with an internal standardization curve .
The sensitivity of the EASIA tests was 3 and 2 pg/ml for TNF-a and IL-1 } respectively .
RESULTS HOCGI induces the activation of NF-xB binding factor in a T-lymphocytic cell line H , O , -mediated oxidative stress has been reported to strongly activate the transcription factor NF- « B in lymphocytes or in various transformed cell lines [ 1,33 ] .
We performed EMSA in order to determine whether HOCl-mediated oxidative stress could lead to a similar induction of this transcription factor in a T-lymphocytic cell line .
Within 120 min following the oxidative stress mediated by HOC ] , a factor capable of binding to the « B sites of the HIV-1 enhancer could be detected in the nuclear extracts of ACH-2 cells ( Figure 1 ) .
The level of induction was directly related to the concentration of HOC ] ( Figure 1 ) .
Analysis of the NF- « B induction by phosphorimaging revealed that the intensity of the complex varied with HOC concentration in a dose-dependent manner ; maximal induction was observed between 200 and 250 aM HOC ( Figure 1 , lanes 4 and 5 ) where a maximal stimulation factor of 10.5 could be detected .
At 300 gM HOC ] , the band intensity decreased , probably due to a cytotoxic effect .
The specificity for these « B sites was shown by the disappearance of this complex through competition with an excess of unlabelled probe ( Figure 2 , lane 5 ) but not by an excess of unlabelled AP-1 probe ( Figure 2 , lane 6 ) .
Another complex , showing greater electrophoretic mobility ( Figures 1 and 2 ) , seemed to be induced with the same kinetic characteristics , but was not competed out by the wild-type probe ( Figure 2 ) .

Induction of a nuclear « B enhancer DNA-binding protein by treatment of ACH-2 cells with increasing concentrations of HOCI ( 0-300 M ) , PMA ( 1 M ) and H0 , ( 100 M ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared 120 min after the reaction and equal amounts of proteins were mixed with a *P-labelled probe encompassing the xB elements of the HIV-1 enhancer .
Samples were loaded on 6 % native polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 150 V. An autoradiogram of the gel is shown .
Arrows indicate the positions of the specific complex and of the free probe .
the latter complex did not seem to involve a nuclear factor which binds specifically to the « B sites .
The intensity of the specific « B complex induced by HOC is lower than that induced by phorbol 12-myristate l3-acetate ( PMA ) ( Figure 1 , lane 7 ) or by H , O , in a similar concentration range ( Figure 1 , lane 8 ) , demonstrating that while HOC ] should be considered as an oxidative species capable of inducing NF-kB , the nuclear translocation of this complex is less efficient than with other ROS such as H , O , [ 1,33 ] or singlet oxygen [ 34,35 ] .
The identity of the HOCl-activated DNA-protein complex with an NF- « B probe was further investigated in supershift experiments ( Figure 2 ) .
We examined whether the HOCI-activated NF- « B complex could react with antisera raised against the DNA-binding p50 and p65 subunits of NF- « B as well as with c-Rel .
The anti-p50 and anti-p65 sera clearly gave rise to a characteristic supershift of the retarded complex , demonstrating unambiguously that the HOCl-activated factor is p50- and p65-containing NF- « B ( Figure 2 , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
No supershift of the specific complex could be observed either with c-Rel ( Figure 2 , lane 4 ) , with p52 antibodies , or with an unrelated serum ( results not shown ) .
Nuclear appearance of NF- « B has been shown to be quite rapid when induction is carried out with various membrane-targeting mediators , such as IL-1 , phorbol ester or lipopoly-saccharide [ 19,20 ] .
In order to determine whether NF- « B induction occurs in a similar time scale , ACH-2 cells were treated 780 S. Schoonbroodt and others § g WT AP- ] Competitor * 7 50x 50x Serum anti- p50 p65 cRel .

Nuclear extracts from ACH-2 cells treated with HOCI ( 200 M ) were either mixed directly with the `` p-iabelled « B probe or incubated with antisera specific for p50 , p65 or c-Rel before being mixed with the °P-labelled B probe .
Samples were then loaded on a 4 % polyacrylamide native ge !
and electrophoresed as in Figure 1 .
Competition with an unlabelled oligonucleotide ( 50 M excess ) , encompassing NF-KB sites , reveals the position of the specific NF- « B complex .
The specific NF- « B band could not be competed out with a 50 M excess of a probe encompassing the AP-1 element of the collagenase gene promoter .
WT , wild-type probe .
with HOC ( 200 wM ) and nuclear extracts were prepared at various time points ( between 0 and 300 min ) before being analysed by EMSA with a xB probe .
Figure 3 ( A ) shows that very shortly after the stress ( 0-30 min ) , no NF- « B-specific complex could be detected .
The minimal induction time required to detect a specific NF- « B complex turned out to be 60 min ( Figure 3A , lane 3 ) , this complex still being observable for longer periods up to 300 min ( Figure 3A , lane 7 ) .
These data reveal that NF- « B induction mediated by HOC ] is significantly slower than that observed with other inducers acting directly at the cell membrane , where maximal NF- « B induction occurred within 5-30 min [ 19,20 ] .
Indeed , NF- « B induction by H , O , was rather similar to that measured by HOC ] : it was detectable after 60 min ( Figure 3B , lane 3 ) and was sustained up to 300 min ( Figure 3B , lane 8 ) .
Another characteristic of NF- « B is its activation by a post-translational mechanism involving the release of the inhibitory subunit IxB from a cytoplasmic inactive form [ 36 ] .
In order to investigate whether the activation of NF- « B by HOC involves a post-translational mechanism , the oxidative stress was performed in the presence of cycloheximide ( CHX ) , a protein synthesis inhibitor ( Figure 3A ) .
When ACH-2 cells alone were treated with 25 ug/ml CHX , only a very weak activation of NF- « B was seen .
On the other hand , NF-KB activity induced by HOC ] at 200 4M was not affected by the presence of CHX , indicating that up to 150 min after the stress , NF- « B was activated by a post-translational mechanism ( Figure 3A , lanes 8-10 ) .
At a longer time ( 300 min ) , the intensity of the band was decreased , demonstrating that part of the induction at this longer time might be due to a transcriptional mechanism ( Figure 3A , lane 11 ) .

Hyperthermia was carried out by raising the temperature from 37 °C to 42 °C over a period of 30 min and maintaining cells at 42 °C for 40 min before cooling the cells down .
Samples were treated as in Figure 1 and analysed on a 4 % -polyacrylamide native ge !
and electrophoresed .
mentioned above , then placed in culture medium .
Aliquots were prepared various times after the stress to follow the disappearance of I « kB- @ in conjunction with the induction of NF- « B .
In both untreated cells and at very short times after the stress , IxB-m-specific IgG detected a single 38 kDa band on Western blots .
Between 120 and 150 min after the stress , the amount of IxB- « decreased significantly in cytoplasm , coinciding with the appearance of NF- « B activity in the nucleus .
These results confirmed the temporal relationship between the two biochemical events .
Similarly , analysis of the cytoplasmic content of p50 and its precursor p1l05 revealed that the amount of p105 slowly decreased and disappeared completely 180 min after the stress ( Figure 4C ) .
The kinetics of IxB- « proteolysis and p105 cleavage occurred concomitantly with the nuclear appearance of NF-kB , demonstrating that these two inhibitory molecules are involved in sequestering p50/p65 in the cytoplasm of ACH-2 cells .
On the other hand , the amount of cytoplasmic p65 remained constant after HOCl-mediated stress ( Figure 4B ) .
Hyperthermia sensitizes ACH-2 cells to HOC treatment Since the accumulation of inflammatory cells in a damaged tissue site is accompanied by the release of ROS , pro-inflammatory cytokines and a possible rise in temperature [ 37,38 ] , we tested the role of hyperthermia as a cofactor capable of enhancing the efficacy of HOC ] in activating NF- « B .
ACH-2 cells were first subjected to a slow increase in temperature , from 37 to 42 °C in 30 min , the cells then being maintained at 42 °C for 40 min .
The temperature was then restored to 37 °C within 30 min .
Nuclear extracts were taken at various phases of temperature variation and were analysed by a gel-retardation assay using an NF- « B probe .
No retarded bands corresponding to the NF- « B-specific complex could be detected on the gel ( results not shown ) , demonstrating that this factor was not significantly activated during and after the hyperthermia .
In a second step , ACH-2 cells were subjected to a hyperthermic stress similar to that described above before being stressed directly by various HOC concentrations as soon as the temperature had returned to 37 °C .
Nuclear extracts were then prepared 180 min after the end of the hyperthermia for analysis by a gel-retardation assay .
As shown in Figure 5 , the NF- « B-specific retarded band appeared clearly at low HOC concentrations , i.e .
between 100 and 150 gM .
In cells not exposed to hyperthermia , NF- « B was not detectable at these HOC ] concentrations .
At higher HOC ] concentrations ( 200-300 M ) , the NF- « B band was clearly 3-fold less intense in non-hyperthermic cells compared with cells subjected to one round of hyperthermia .
Antioxidants block NF-xB induction by HOC !
Taken together , our data suggest that HOC ] induced NF- « B activity in ACH-2 cells through a signal transduction pathway involving the intracellular release of ROS , because the kinetics of induction very closely resemble those observed when H , O , is added to either lymphocyte or monocyte [ 11,39 ] .
We thus investigated the nature of the intermediates suspected of mediating HOCl-dependent NF- « B induction in ACH-2 cells .
The free radical scavenger pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) and nordihydroguaiaretic acid [ 40 ] were able to suppress NF- « B activation , in a dose-dependent manner after HOC stimulation of ACH-2 cells ( Table 1 ) , the inhibition being almost complete at 100 zM PDTC .
Since the generation of intracellular ROS could proceed through the involvement of phospholipase A2 ( PLA2 ) , we tested the functional importance of these enzymes on HOCl-mediated NF-KB activation by using an inhibitor .
The involvement of PLA2 was evaluated by using p-bromophenacyl-bromide ( BPB ) , an irreversible inhibitor of PLA2 [ 41 ] .
To this end , ACH-2 cells were pretreated for 60 min with increasing concentrations of BPB and then stimulated with HOC .
Nontoxic concentrations of BPB strongly inhibited , in a dose-dependent manner , NF- « B activation by HOC ] , demonstrating the importance of PLA2 in the pathway ( Table 1 ) .
TNF- is released in the supernatants of cells treated with HOCI or H,0 , In order to characterize the release of cytokines in the cell supernatant after an oxidative stress mediated either by H , O , or HOC , IL-1 # and TNF- « levels were measured in cell supernatants .
The amount of IL-1/ # released by ACH-2 cells after these oxidative stresses was very low and was only very weakly stimulated by either H , O , or HOC ] compared with the background levels ( results not shown ) .
On the other hand , less than 5 pg/ml TNF-a was detectable in the supernatant of untreated ACH-2 cells during the first 8 h of culture .
This amount was increased when cells were treated with both chemicals .
With H,0 , , the amount of TNF- « released was stimulated more than 20-fold until 8 h after the stress , before returning to the level observed in untreated ACH-2 cells after 24 h ( Figure 6 ) .
The same behaviour was observed with HOC , except that the amplitude was lower , with maximal stimulation being ~ 5-fold after 8 h. Addition of 25 ug/ml CHX before the stress mediated by H,0 , or HOC abolished the release of TNF- « in the supernatant ( results not shown ) .
These results indicate that a 782 S.

TNF- « plays a crucial role in NF-xB induction by both H,0 , and HOGI In order to determine the functionality of the TNF-a released in cell supernatants in terms of NF- « B inducibility , we treated ACH-2 cells with equivalent TNF- « concentrations to those released in supernatants after treatment with H,0 , or HOC , i.e .
100 and 33 pg/ml respectively ( or 16.6 and 5 units/ml ) .
Nuclear extracts were prepared 30 , 60 and 120 min after induction and analysed by EMSA .
As shown in Figure 7 ( A ) , a rather important specific NF- « B induction was detectable in the nucleus of ACH-2 cells treated under these conditions .
On the other hand , supernatants of ACH-2 cells pretreated with either H , O , ( 100 wM ) or HOC ( 200 4M ) were collected and transferred onto untreated ACH-2 cells before being used to prepare nuclear extracts 30 , 60 or 120 min after supernatant addition .
As shown in Figure 7 ( B ) , a clear NF- « B band can be induced 60 min after addition of the supernatant taken from ACH-2 cells treated with H , O , for 180 min .

It should be noted that traces of H , O , remaining in cell supernatants were eliminated by treating supernatants with 10 units/ml catalase .
To verify whether the effect was due to TNF- @ release subsequent to oxidative stress , supernatants were treated with Sepharose beads to which either anti-TNF- « monoclonal antibody or an irrelevant antibody was attached .
The supernatants thus treated were added to ACH-2 cells and nuclear extracts were prepared after 30 , 60 or 120 min .
As shown in Figure 7 ( B ) , the treatment of cell supernatants taken from cells treated with H,0 , , with the beads linked to an anti-TNF- « antibody , abolished NF- « B induction , while beads alone did not modify NF- « B induction by supernatant transfer .
The specificity of the complex was shown by its disappearance through competition with an excess of unlabelled probe , but not with an excess of unlabelled mutated probe ( Figure 7C ) .

Nuclear extracts were prepared 180 min after treatment with HOCI , and an equal amount of protein was mixed with a **P-labelled NF-B probe .
Samples were analysed as in Figure 1. that TNF-a released after treatment with H , O , or HOC ] is functional and is an important secondary messenger which could be propagated to uninduced cells .
Pretreatment with TNF-a sensitizes ACH-2 cells to HOC To corroborate the demonstration that TNF-a played a crucial role in NF- « B induction by HOCH , ACH-2 cells were pretreated with TNF-a before being stressed with HOC in order to reveal potential additive or synergistic effects between these two agents .
ACH-2 cells were first treated with TNF-a ( 0 , 20 or 200 units/ml ) for 90 min .
After induction , nuclear extracts were prepared and analysed by gel-retardation assay .
As shown in Figure 8 , a specific NF- « B complex could be clearly seen , even at TNF-concentrations as low as 20 units/ml ; this stimulation was slightly increased for higher TNF- « concentrations .
When these cells were prestimulated with TNF-a at either 20 or 200 units/ml and stressed 90 min later with HOC ] ranging from 100 to 300 zM , the induction of NF- « B was significantly higher than in non-pretreated cells ( Figure 8 ) .
These results again demonstrate that cell pretreatment with TNF- , which is known to generate intracellular ROS , renders ACH-2 cells more sensitive to subsequent stress mediated by HOC ] , in terms of NF- « B nuclear induction .
DISCUSSION In this work , we have shown that exposure of a T-lymphocyte cell line to an oxidizing treatment mediated by HOC ] leads to activation of the NF- « B complex .
The form of NF- « B induced by HOC ] is the heterodimer p50/p65 .
This induction presents the same characteristics as NF- « B induction by PMA , lectins or cytokines [ 19,20 ] , except that induction was slower in the case of HOC .
This may occur , either because HOC ] alters one of the components ( e.g .
a cytoplasmic signalling protein ) involved in activation , or because HOC ] is not produced close enough to ( i.e .
does not directly damage ) the cellular component from which the induction of NF- « B is initiated .
However , activation by HOC seems to be completely achieved after 4 h , possibly because several different activation pathways could well be required for full NF- « B activation .
Thus , it is perhaps likely that an identical sensor molecule is activated by both H,0 , and HOCH ] , triggering IkB-a and p105 degradation and allowing p50/p65 to migrate inside the cell nucleus to activate genes harboring NF- « B responsive elements in their promoters [ 1,4 ] .
The candidate sensory molecule would be oxidized by both HOC ] and H , O , and would transmit the message , leading to the degradation of the inhibitory subunits , retaining inactive NF- « B in the cytoplasm .
The cellular damage generated by HOC ] is as diversified as that caused by exposure to H,0 , , if it is assumed that H , O , acts through generation of hydroxyl radicals in Fenton reactions .
With a pK , of 7.53 , HOC exists in essentially equal concentrations as the conjugate base hypochlorite ( OCT ) [ 30,42 ] .
HOCI/OCI- is a powerful biologically relevant oxidizing agent and can introduce damage to protein , lipid , carbohydrate and nucleic acid [ 43-45 ] .
Furthermore , reaction of HOC with amino and imino acids is known to generate long-lived N-chloroamines [ 27,46 ] .
Although N-chloroamines exhibit a lower oxidizing potential than HOC , their much longer lifetimes may enable such species to cause damage at distant sites [ 27,47 ] .
In constrast , HOC ] is thought to react close to its site of production [ 44,45 ] .
Thus , addition of HOC ] directly to the culture medium would damage T-lymphocyte membranes , modifying proteins and generating lipid peroxidation .
These two kinds of oxidation products , i.e .
protein modifications and lipid peroxidation products , have been recognized as being stimuli for NF- « B activation ( see [ 4,48 ] for reviews ) .
In particular , it has recently been shown that the treatment of Jurkat T-cells with millimolar concentrations of H , O , generates the association between the £ and e chains of the T-cell receptor with ZAP-70 kinase [ 21,22 ] .
This event occurs very rapidly after treatment , and is suspected to be crucial in the transduction pathways initiated by H,0 , .
Because HOC is known to generate chlorinated adducts on proteins [ 44,48 ] , it can be envisaged that these oxidation products could favour the formation of protein-protein interactions such as those between tyrosine kinases and membrane receptors .
These events would take place at the cellular membrane and would be initiated by oxidative damage generated by HOC ] .
HOC ] is also known to generate DNA-oxidation products .
It has been suggested by several authors that DNA damage [ 35,49,50 ] , especially thymidine dimers induced by UV light , could also be an event triggering a transduction pathway leading to IxB- « phosphorylation [ 49,50 ] .
Thus , in summary , it can be proposed that HOC ] is an oxidant that behaves somewhat like H , O , and can activate NF- « B through various transduction pathways initiated at several cellular localizations .
In an attempt to further characterize the events involved in NF- « B activation by HOC ] , we have used inhibitors known to act in a signal-transduction pathway yielding ROS [ 51 ] .
Inhibition of PLA2 was shown to prevent NF-kB activation by HOCI .
We further observed that HOCl-induced NF- « B activation was completely abolished by antioxidants such as PDTC or nordihydroguaiaretic acid , which concurs with the idea that intracellular ROS generation may be the ultimate step leading to 784 S. Schoonbroodt and others IkB-a or p105 phoshorylation .
Further experiments are needed to fully characterize all the intermediates involved in this pathway , especially the redox-regulated kinase which is activated by intracellular ROS and suspected of being involved in IkB-a or p105 phosphorylation .
Nonetheless , the fact that inhibitors other than antioxidants can prevent NF- « B induction by HOC suggests that intracellular ROS are generated subsequent to the initial reaction mediated by HOCI .
Several studies have shown that activation of NF- « B in response to other stimuli , such as cytokines , lipopolysaccharide , or anti-CD 28 , can be abolished by antioxidants , suggesting that ROS may represent widely used secondary messenger molecules in lymphocytes or monocytes [ 1,51-54 ] .
Within the spectrum of systemic reactions to inflammation , several physiological responses are regarded as being associated with acute inflammation .
One of these is the alteration of the temperature set point in the hypothalamus and the generation of febrile response [ 37,55 ] .
Three cytokines that are released from the site of injury ( IL-1 , TNF and IL-6 ) are considered to regulate the febrile response , possibly as a protective mechanism , and to mediate fever through the induction of prostaglandin E2 [ 37 ] .
Since fever and oxidants released by inflammatory cells may exert synergistic actions in modifying cellular metabolism , and more specifically gene expression , we have investigated these effects on NF-KB induction .
When T-cells undergo one round of hyperthermia no clear induction of NF- « B seems to occur .
However , when the heat-stressed cells were subjected to a subsequent stress with HOC ] a more important NF- « B induction could be detected .
These results provide clear evidence of increased susceptibility to HOCI , suggesting that hyperthermia can constitute a phase which can significantly worsen the damage induced by a second oxidative stress .
This shows that synergistic effects between fever and inflammatory processes might occur .
Similarly , a synergism between TNF- « and HOC ] has been also demonstrated in this paper .
Because TNF-a is known to cause the intracellular release of ROS [ 56 ] , it seems very likely that cellular antioxidant defences are transiently depressed by TNF-a treatment , rendering these cells more susceptible to a subsequent stress , mediated in this case by HOC .
Mitochondria play a crucial role in causing TNF-induced cytotoxicity in TNF-sensitive cells [ 56,57 ] .
Presumably , upon TNF- « stimulation , mitochondrial radicals are formed at the ubiquinone site of the respiratory chain , where electrons are directly transferred from ubisemiquinone to molecular oxygen .
This one-electron transfer results in the formation of O , as the primary reactive oxygen species of mitochondria , and is probably the cause of the observed synergistic effect between hyperthermia or TNF- « and HOCH .
Consistent with these findings , another important aspect of this work has been to demonstrate that oxidative stress induced by the addition of H , O , or HOC ] contributes significantly to the release of TNF-a in cell supernatants during the first 8 h following stress .
TNF- « @ release in response to oxidative stress is a very important observation , because we have shown that this molecule is biologically active and capable of activating , even at low doses , non-induced cells in terms of NF- « B translocation .
The release of this pro-inflammatory cytokine should contribute significantly to amplification and also propagation of the activation message to non-induced cells , triggering a generalized pro-oxidant state in distant cells .
In this paper , we have shown for the first time that HOC ] , which is produced by activated neutrophils , can contribute significantly to the establishment of pro-oxidant conditions in a T-lymphocytic cell line , either directly , by triggering a transduction pathway which in turn leads to the nuclear translocation of NF- « B , or indirectly , by contributing to the processing and release of TNF- in cell supernatants .
Given that HOC has a rather short diffusion radius in biological media because of its rather important reactivity [ 58 ] , the fact that TNF-a can be released in response to its reaction with T-cells makes it possible to understand how local oxidation can have long-distance effects .
