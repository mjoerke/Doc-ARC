The cDNA library was screened with the patients own autoimmune serum being monospecific for the nuclear autoantigen La/SS-B .
Thereby an alternative type of La mRNA was identified that differed from the known La mRNA due to an exchange of the exon 1 .
Sequencing of the genomic region between the exons 1 and 2 showed that the alternative 5-end is a part of the intron .
In addition , the presence of an alternative promoter site , which exists within the intron downstream of the exon 1 , became evident .
In consequence , the alternative La mRNA is the result of a promoter switching combined with an alternative splicing mechanism .
In the intron , further transcription factor binding sites , including a NF-KB element , were identified leading to the suggestion that the expression of the gene encoding for the nuclear autoantigen La/SS-B alters in dependence on disease conditions .
he basic mechanisms for development of autoimmunity , including the development of autoantibodies directed to nuclear antigens ( ANAs ) ' , in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) or primary Sjégrens ' syndrome ( pSS ) are not understood .
It is assumed that unknown genomic prerequisites together with viruses may play a role during development of autoimmunity .
Especially herpesviruses , including the Epstein Barr virus as well as exogenous or en-dogenous retroviruses , were discussed as possible causative agents of these diseases ( 1 , 2 ) .
An involvement of retroviruses in pSS is supported by ( a ) an appearance of antibodies to retroviral proteins in patients with pSS and ( b ) the isolation of an A-type retroviral particle in lymphoblastoid cells exposed to homogenates of salivary tissue from patients with pSS ( 3 ) .
In addition , the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , can produce a clinical syndrome and immunologic changes similar to those seen in pSS , including the development of ANAs ( 4 ) .
Nonetheless , even if these or other viruses are involved in autoimmunity in pSS and SLE patients , the mechanism by which viruses can lead to the development 1 Abbreviations used in this paper : ANA , autoantibodies directed to nuclear antigen ; pSS , primary Sjogrens ' syndrome ; SLE , systemic lupus erythem-atosus .
of ANAs remains obscure , as these autoantibodies are at least partially the product of an autoantigen driven oligoclonal B cell response ( 5 , 6 ) .
One of the targets of an ANA system is the nuclear autoantigen La/SS-B ( 7 ) .
La protein has been suggested to be involved in transcription termination of RNA polymerase III and internal initiation of translation of at least poliovirus mRNA ( 8-10 ) .
Up to now more than 20 La cDNAs have been isolated by six independent groups and no dramatic differences had been observed ( 11-16 ) .
The transcription of this described type of La mRNA was suggested to occur from a GC-rich promotor region upstream of the exon 1 lacking a TATA-element , leading to the conclusion that La protein belongs to the housekeeping proteins ( 17 ) .
In case of some protooncogenes , inflammatory mediators , signal transduction components , proteins involved in the immune response , transcription factors , growth factor receptors , and some other housekeeping proteins , in addition to the respective translatable mRNA , an alternative mRNA has been described .
Usually the exon 1 is replaced in the respective alternative mRNA .
The alternative 5'-terminus alters the properties of the mRNAs dramatically as it contains GC-rich regions and/or additional less functional AUGs upstream of the major open reading frame ( 18 ) .
Due to their unusual 5'-terminal structure , such mRNAs were hypothesized to ei- 2059 J. Exp .

Here we describe the isolation and characterization of such an alternative type of mRNA derived from the gene encoding for the autoantigen La/SS-B .
Materials and Methods Preparation of a cDNA Library from the PBL of a Patient with pSS .
RNA was isolated from PBL of a patient with pSS ( Ma ) as basically described by Chirgwin et al .
( 19 ) using modifications according to Semsei and Cutler ( 20 ) .
Poly ( A ) * mRNA was isolated from the RNA preparation using oligo ( dT ) -column chroma-tography ( 20 ) .
The cDNAs were synthesized using the ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit and ligated to the Uni-ZAPXR vector arms ( Stratagene , Heidelberg , Germany , 21 ) .
The A-library was packaged by Giga-pack II Gold packaging extract ( Stratagene ) , plated and amplified in the Escherichia coli cell lines PKL-F ' and XL1-Blue , respectively .
The complexity of the library was 10° pfu .
Immunoscreening .
- Immunoscreening was performed using the patient 's anti-La serum ( 10 ml ) .
Before use , the serum was extensively preadsorbed to a Sepharose 4B column ( 5 ml ) , which had been covalently linked to a total extract obtained from E. coli ( strain Y¥1090 ) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml gel .
The first screening was followed by second and third screenings using the antibody solution left from the first screening step .
The clones were checked in parallel with a cell culture supernatant of a hybridoma line producing a monoclonal anti-La antibody ( termed La4B6 , obtained by immunization of BAL B/c mice with a recombinant human La protein ; Troster , H. , T. Metzger , R. Klein , G. Pollak , I. Semsei , M. Schwemmle , G. Pruijn , W. van Venrooij , and M. Bachmann , unpublished results ) .
The immunoscreening was performed following the protocol of Mierendorf et al .
( 22 ) .
A total amount of 4 x 10° recombinant phages were screened and five positive La cDNAs were isolated with the patient 's antiserum .
In addition 12 cDNAs encoding for IgG heavy chains were coisolated , which was not surprising as the cDNA library was constructed from PBL and screened with anti-human IgG antibodies .
The coisolated IgG heavy chain cDNAs were differentiated from the La cDNAs by ( a ) their different restriction enzyme analysis pattern and ( b ) sequencing .
Isolation and storage of the clones was done according to Sambrook et al .
( 23 ) .
Phagemids ( pBluescript SK ( - ) ) were excised from A phages during an in vivo excision procedure described by Stratagene using the filamentous helper phage strain R408 and the bacterial strain XL1-Blue as a host ( 23 ) .
Construction of Deletion Clones .
- The two clones termed La19 and La23 , which contained the largest inserts , were selected for sequencing .
The other cDNAs were only sequenced from the 3'-and the 5'-end to characterize them as La cDNAs .
DNA was prepared from small scale cultures ( up to 12 ml ) using the protocol of Holmes and Quigley ( 24 ) modified according to Sambrook et al .
( 23 ) .
To create deletion clones the method originally described by Henikoff ( 25 ) was used .
The DNA to be deleted was cut with BstXI and EcoRI from which site deletions started .
Construction of a Genomic Subclone For subcloning of the genomic fragment derived from the charon phage ALaZ-1 ( 17 ) , which was kindly provided by Dr. Keene ( Duke University , Durham , NC ) , the `` shot gun '' cloning technique was used .
13 ng of ALa2-1 DNA was digested with EcoRI ( 5 U/pg DNA in 2x One-Phor-All-Buffer PLUS [ Pharmacia LKB , Freiburg , Germany ] ) .
In earlier studies Chambers et al .
( 17 ) had shown that a digestion of genomic DNA with EcoRI resulted among other fragments 2060 in a 4.6-kb fragment of the La gene .
According to our calculations the molecular mass of this fragment might be about 4.8 kb .
The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 17 mM followed by a heat treatment for 20 min at 68°C .
The pBluescript SK ( - ) vector DNA ( Stratagene ) was digested with EcoRI ( 2.5 U/ ug of DNA ) at a concentration of 0.88 ug DNA/ ul in 2x One-Phor-All-Buffer PLUS .
After dilution ( 1:4 ) and an in-activation step by heating to 68°C for 20 min , calf intestine phosphatase ( CIP ; Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) was added ( 0.3 U CIP/ug DNA ) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the recommended buffer ( 10x : 0.5 M Tris/HCI , pH 8.5 ; 1 mM EDTA ) .
The enzyme was inactivated by the addition of EDTA ( 16 mM final concentration ) in combination with heating for 30 min to 75°C .
The ligation of the EcoRI-fragments with the phosphatase-treated EcoRI-digested vector DNA took place in a 10 pl volume at 16°C overnight .
The reaction mixture consisted of 200 ng vector DNA , 30 ng of EcoRI-fragments in Tris/HCl , pH 7.5 containing 1 mM ATP , 1 mM dithiothreitol , and 5 mM MgCl ; .
Then the ligation reaction was adjusted to a volume of 100 pul with H ; 0 and added to 200 pl of competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells for transformation according to Sambrook et al .
( 23 ) .
The bacteria were plated on ampicillin ( 150 ug/ml ) agar containing 2.5 mM isopropyl B-o-thiogalactoside ( IPTG ) and 0.4 % ( wt/vol ) X-Gal in order to discriminate religated vector DNA ( blue colonies ) from colonies containing vectors with inserts ( white colonies ) .
Plasmid DNAs derived from white colonies were found to contain the desired 4.8-kb fragment of the La gene .
Southern Blotting .
DNA was isolated as basically described by Chirgwin et al .
( 19 ) using minor modifications according to Semsei and Cutler ( 20 ) .
The DNA was digested with EcoRI and 13 ug of DNA per lane were loaded on an 0.7 % agarose gel .
The gel was run for 16 h with 1.8 V/cm .
Southern blotting was performed according to Sambrook et al .
( 23 ) .
After transfer onto a positively charged Nylon membrane ( Boehringer Mannheim ) the DNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation with 120 mJ using a Stratalinker 1800 ( Stratagene ) followed by a heat treatment for 60 min at 80°C .
Hybridizations and labelings of the DNA were performed according to the nonradioactive detection system ( Boehringer Mannheim } .
The signals were developed using anti-DIG antibodies covalently linked to either alkaline phosphatase and CSPD ( TRopix , Serva Heidelberg , Germany ) as substrate ( see Fig .
2 A ) or peroxidase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) and the enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) detection system ( Amersham-Buchler , Braunschweig , Germany ) ( see Fig .
2 , B and C ) .
Between the three hybridizations , membrane stripping was performed as follows .
The filter was washed twice in 0.1 % SDS at room temperature followed by a proteinase K treatment ( 1 mg/ml ) in 0.1 % SDS for 35 min at 55°C and 10 min at 65°C .
Afterward the membrane was further stripped as described by Sambrook et al .
( 23 ) .
For this purpose the blot was washed with 50 % formamide , 2x SSPE at room temperature and in the same buffer at 65°C for 45 min .
The membrane was rinsed in 0.1 % SDS , 0.1x SSC at room temperature , dried on 3MM-paper ( Whatman International Ltd. , Maidstone , UK ) and stored at room temperature in the dark and dry .
PCR .
PCR was performed using a TC9600 Cycler ( Perkin-Elmer , Uberlingen , Germany ) .
The 50-ul assay in 1x Taq buffer contained 2 U Taq polymerase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , 1.5 mM MgC ] , 5 % ( vol/vol ) DMSO , 200 mM of each dNTP , 20 pmol of each primer , and 100 ng of genomic DNA or 1 ng of plasmid DNA .
Cycling was started by heating for 2 min to 94°C .
40 cycles followed , each consisting of 15 s at 94°C , 15 s at 55-60°C depending on the primer pairs used , and 15-60 s at 72°C depending on the length of the resulting fragments .
Then the temperature Alternative Transcript Encoding for the Autoantigen La/SS-B was held for 10 min at 72°C and cooled down to 4°C .
6 ul of the respective assay were taken , and 1.5 pl of sample buffer ( 40 % sucrose , 0.25 % bromophenol blue in H ; 0 ) was added and applied to a 1.5-1.8 % agarose ( Biozym , Hameln , Germany ) gel in TAE buffer ( 40 mM Tris-acetate , pH 8.0 ; 1 mM EDTA ) .
For determination of the molecular weights of the PCR products 250 ng of the DNA molecular weight marker VI ( Boehringer Mannheim ) was run in parallel .
The gels were run for 10 min at 5 V/cm and 120 min at 3 V/cm and stained with ethidium bromide .
Photographs were taken with polaroid film 667 .
DNA Sequence Analysis The DNA for sequencing of the cDNAs was prepared by alkaline lysis miniprep method according to Sambrook et al .
( 23 ) .
The DNA samples were sequenced using the automatic fluorescent DNA sequencing system of the EMBL .
The sequences were evaluated running the evaluation program COMGRA on a 486 PC system .
DNA comparison and alignments were performed using the program package HUSAR of the DKFZ ( Heidelberg , Germany ) .
The genomic sequences were prepared from genomic DNA isolated from different tissues including PBL of the patient ( Ma ; [ 8 ] ) with pSS , an SLE patient ( p62 ) , and her baby born with AV block ( p61 ) , as well as several healthy donors , and the subclone derived from the genomic clone ALaZ-1 ( see above ) , the liver of a tumor patient ( We ) , and the embryonic spleen .
The genomic sequence between the promotor upstream of the exon 1 and the end of the exon 2 was determined for the subclone prepared from the genomic clone ALa2Z-1 ( see above ) as well as for the genomic DNA of the patient ( Ma ) .
For that purpose overlapping PCR fragments were prepared and sequenced using the Cycle Sequencing Kit from Pharmacia LKB and/or the PCR fragments were directly sequenced { see below ) .
In the case of the GC-rich region between the exon 1 and the oligo ( dT ) -tail the PCR fragments prepared were not only directly sequenced but subcloned into pBluescript and at least three subclones were sequenced .
The following primers were used for sequencing of the genomic region between promoter 1 and the exon 2 : P1 ( GCACTTCACAT-GAATGGAGG ) ; P2 ( GAGTCGTTGCTGTTGCTGTTTG ) ; P3 ( GCACAGGCTCACAAACAGCAAC ) ; P4 ( GCTGTTTGTGAG-CCTGTGCGGCGGC ) ; P5 ( GT TCCT TAGATACTCTATGC ) ; P6 ( CGCTTTACTAGTGCGCGACTGCGCGTTTCC ) ; P7 ( AAG-ACGCAATGGGGATGAGG ) ; P8 ( ACCGCCTTCTAGTCTCAC-CGAA ) ; P9 ( ACAAGCCTTCGGTGAGACTAGA ) ; P10 ( CCC-ACCTCCCCAGAAACTTTACAG ) ; PM ( GCACGGGGTAAA-CGCCGGAGGGTTC ) ; P12 ( CTGAAACCTGATGTGAGCGAT-G ) ; P13 ( GCCAAATAGGTTTTGCAGGGTG ) ; P14 ( ATGCTTC-CAGGAAGTGTACC ) ; P15 ( GT TAGTATGACCACATTCTCCC ) ; P16 ( GGACCCTTTTGTAGCTTCTC ) ; P17 ( AGTTCAAGACCA-GCCTGACC ) ; P18 ( CT TCACTTAGCTGGTCAAGC ) ; P19 ( CTC-AACAAAGCAACACTTTGG ) ; P20 ( TCACCATTTTCAGCC-ATTGCGG ) ; P21 ( GATGACAGATTTTGGCCTCCAG ) .
Cycle sequencing was performed using the Cycle Sequencing Kit from Pharmacia LKB and the Cycler TC9600 ( Perkin-Elmer ) .
Four caps were prepared by adding to each 2 ul of one of the four termination mixtures ( A , C , G , T ) and stored at 4°C until use .
Then master mixes were prepared consisting of 2 ul primer solutions containing up to 10 pmol primer , 5 pul of 5x sequencing buffer , 1 ul dNTP mix , 1 ul Tth ( Thermus thermophilus ) DNA polymerase ( 1 U/ul ) , 1 ul « - [ P ] dATP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ; NEN , Dreieich , Germany ) , and 2 ug of template DNA .
5 pul of the respective master mix were added to each of the four termination mixtures ( A , C , G , T ) .
Cycling was started by heating for 2 min to 95°C .
Then 25 ( to 50 ) cycles followed , each consisting of 30 s at 95°C , 36 s at 55°C , and 84 s at 72°C .
Finally the reaction mix 2061 Troster et al .
tures were held for 5 min at 72°C and cooled to 4°C until the addition of 3 pl of the stop solution .
The radioactivity labeled samples were separated on a sequencing gel using the sequencing system LKB 2010 Macrophor ( Pharmacia LKB ) .
Fo ) r directly sequencing of the PCR fragments the T7-Sequenase-Kit from Pharmacia LKB was used according to the following procedure .
The PCR products were first separated on 3 to 4 % NuSieve ( Biozym ) agarose gels and eluted using GENECLEAN II ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) .
4 ul of isolated DNA at a concentration of 10-20 ug/ml were added to 2 pul annealing buffer .
Then 2 ul primer solutions containing 300 ng of primer were added , followed by 1.2 ul of NP-40 ( 5 % ) and 2.8 ul H , O .
The complete annealing mixture ( 12 ul ) was briefly centrifuged using an Eppendorf centrifuge ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) and rapidly heated to 95°C for 3 min .
Then the annealing mixture was immediately transferred to liquid nitrogen .
For labeling 6 pl of the labeling mixture ( T7-Sequenase-Kit ; Pharmacia , LKB ) , which consisted of 3 ul Labeling-Mix , 0.5 ul e « - [ *S } -dATP ( 1,000 Ci/mmol ) , 2 ul T7-polymerase ( 2 U/ ul ) , and 0.5 ul NP-40 ( 5 % ) , was added .
4 pl aliquots were used for each dNTP .
The labeling reaction was started by adding and briefly centrifuging of the 4 ul labeling mixtures to the respective mixture consisting of 2 ul of one of the four short mixes ( A , C , G , T ) and 0.5 ul NP-40 ( 5 % ) .
Labeling was performed for 5 min at 37°C .
Then 2 pul of a chase mixture consisting of 2 ul dNTPs ( 2.5 mM ) , 2 al NP-40 ( 5 % ) , 2 ul NaCl ( 500 mM ) , and 14 ul H ; O0 was added , briefly centrifuged and incubated for 5 min at 37°C .
Finally , the reaction was stopped by adding 5 pl stop solution and briefly centrifuging .
5-RACE .
For an analysis of the 5'-ends of the La RNAs we chose the 5-RACE system supplied by GIBCO BRL ( Eggenstein , Germany ) .
It includes a first strand cDNA synthesis and an PCR amplification step .
During reverse transcription , 40 U of RNase inhibitor ( Boehringer Mannheim ) was added to each sample .
The total RNA samples used were isolated from either ( adult ) liver of the tumor patient ( We ) with liver metastasis ( 1.4 ug ) , human embryonic ( 20 week ) spleen ( 5 ug ) , PBL of the patient ( Ma ) with pSS ( 0.3 ug ) , PBL of a ( adult ) control person ( 0.6 ug ) .
The reactions and the following 5'-RACE steps were performed according to the instructions of the supplier .
For the first strand synthesis a primer locating within the exon 3 was used ( TGTCCCGTG-GCAAATTGAAGTCGCC ) .
Amplification was performed using the primers P20 and P12 in combination with the Anchor Primer of the 5'-RACE kit ( GIBCO BRL , Eggenstein , Germany ) .
Results Based on the suggestion that the development of autoantibodies to La protein in patients with SLE and pSS is at least partially driven by the autoantigen itself , one might expect an altered expression of the La gene in patients in dependence on disease conditions .
Therefore , we looked for alternative forms of La mRNAs in tissue obtained from a La positive pSS patient ( Ma ) ( 8 ) .
Isolation of Alternative La cDNAs .
For that purpose a cDNA library was prepared from the patient 's PBLs .
This cDNA library was screened with the patient 's own autoimmune serum .
Thereby five La cDNAs were isolated ( Fig .
1 ) .
Three of them had derived from shortened La mRNAs starting within or downstream of the exon 2 , as became already evidence from restriction enzyme fragment analysis ( Fig .
1 ) and sequencing from the 5'- and 3'-end ( data not shown ) .

Characterization of the La cDNAs isolated from the cDNA library of the patient with pSS by immunoscreening using restriction enzyme fragment analysis .
The screening of the patient 's cDNA library with her own autoimmune serum resulted in the isolation of five cDNAs ( B ; 1-5 ) that had been derived from La mRNAs .
These La cDNAs showed a restriction enzyme fragment pattern similar to the pattern of a La cDNA ( A ) described by Chan et al .
( 13 ) .
The clones with the two longest La inserts were termed as La23 ( 1 ) and La19 ( 2 ) .
The insert in the clone La19 has the opposite orientation as in the other La clones .
residual two La cDNAs ( Fig .
1 , clones 1 and 2 , which were termed as La23 and La19 ) were sequenced and their sequence was given to the EMBL Data Library ( EMBL accession number X69804 ) .
Both La cDNAs were found to start upstream of the exon 2 , but displayed the following three unusual properties : ( a ) they started at their 5° terminus with an oligo ( dT ) -stretch ; ( b ) as already evident from the restriction enzyme fragment analysis ( Fig .
1 ) , the La cDNA insert was inverted in the clone La19 , probably due to the presence of the oligo ( dT ) -stretch , and ; ( c ) upstream of exon 2 , exactly at the splice site , the complete exon 1 was replaced by an unknown 5'-terminal sequence , termed exon 1 ' ( Fig .
2 ) .
Downstream of the exon 2 , the sequence was identical to the described La sequences ( Fig .
2 ) .
Southern Blot Analysis .
To rule out a cloning artifact or the isolation of a splicing intermediate the genomic origin of the exon 1 ' sequence was determined .
By performing Southern blot experiments with genomic DNA of healthy individuals and the patient ( Fig .
3 ) the exon 1 ' was located on a 4.8-kb EcoRI fragment ( Fig .
3 A ) , which was described as containing the exons 1 and 2 , as well as the intron between them ( 17 ) .
In agreement , the same fragment also hybridized to a probe being specific for the exon 1 sequence ( Fig .
3 B ) and was confirmed to be a part of the La gene , as it also hybridized to a probe containing the complete La cDNA sequence ( Fig .
3 C ) .
From this experiment it became also evident that the exon 1 ' sequence is not a patient specific sequence ( Fig .
3 , A-C , lane c ) but exists in healthy donors as well ( Fig .
3 , A-C , lanes a and b ) .
The Genomic Origin of the Alternative La cDNAs .
- 'The next steps were to isolate the 4.8-kb fragment containing the exon 1 ' sequence and to develop a sequencing scheme that allowed us to compare the sequences from healthy donors and patients .
For that purpose the 4.8-kb fragment was subcloned from the genomic clone ALa2-1 ( 17 ) into pBluescript SK ( - ) and sequenced starting upstream of the proposed promoter of exon 1 going downstream through the intron into the 2062 ( I ) [ La19/23 ] TPTTT ... ... . 1 ACCTCCACCGCCTTCTAGTCTCACCGAAGGCTTGTGGCCATCTCTGTAAA 50 51 GTTTCTGGGGAGGTGGGCACGGGGTAAACGCCGGAGGGTTCTGTGGAGCC 100 101 TATGGGACTGACTGGAGGCCAAAGAACTTTGGGCCGCAGATGTACACCAG 150 Gd 10d ( II ) Lo.. clk k eee v ed dea ek re rr enn seee 21 151 CGTCACTCTTTTGGTCTGTTAGGGCCTTCATCGCTCACATCAGGTTTCAG 200 PL arb O ELH LH Ib d 22 GTCGTTGCTGTTGCTGTTTGTGAGCCTGTGGCGC ... ...

Characterization of the alternative form of La mRNA .
A comparison of the sequence derived from the La cDNAs La19 and La23 ( I ; EMBL accession number X69804 ) with the human La cDNA described by Chan et al .
( 13 ) ( IF ; EMBL accession number X13697 ) was performed .
Upstream of the acceptor splice site at exon 2 ( nt 216 ; [ J ] ) the sequences differed , whereas the sequence downstream of the exon 1 ' is identical to the sequence described by Chan et al .
( 13 ) .
The La cDNAs La19 and La23 started with an oligo ( dT ) -tail of different length ( La19 , 31 ( dT ) -residues ; La23 , 52 ( dT ) -residues ) .
At the genomic level the length of the ( dT ) -tail was determined with 23 ( dT ) -residues ( see also Fig .
4 B ) .
exon 2 using a series of primers as schematically summarized in Fig .
4 A .
The resulting complete genomic sequence was given to the EMBL Data Library ( EMBL accession number 235127 ) and is partially shown in Fig .
4 B .
We identified the exon 1 ' sequence , including its oligo ( dT ) -tail , 325 nt downstream of the exon 1 donor splice site .
From this result we concluded that ( a ) the exon 1 ' sequence is a part of the intron between exon 1 and 2 ; ( b ) the alternative La cDNAs La19 and La23 must have been derived from processed hnRNAs ; and ( c ) the 5-terminal oligo ( dT ) -tail of La19 and La23 was not the result of a cloning artifact .

Southern blot experiment of the La gene .

Consensus sequences for transcription factors .
The genomic sequence between the 3'-end of exon 1 ( italics ) and the oligo ( dT ) -tail , which is the start of the La cDNAs La19 and L223 , was analyzed for transcription factor consensus sequences using the program Husar ( DKFZ ) .
In agreement with the 5-RACE result , a TFHD binding site exists -37 nt upstream of the transcription start site ( W nt 1 ) .
In addition , the sequence contains a series of further putative transcription factor binding sites , including a NF-KB element .
It should be mentioned that two heat shock protein ( hsp ) 70 transcription factor consensus sequences are located about 270 nt upstream of the TACAAA site , which is already upstream of the promotor for the exon 1 .
Moreover , a true TATA box locates 50 nt further upstream ( not shown ) .
2064 Determination of the Alternative Transcription Initiation Site - As the oligo ( dT ) -tail was found to be a true part of the alternative La mRNA , it appeared rather unlikely that it should be the transcription initiation site of the La mRNA .
Therefore , in a further approach we looked for the transcription initiation site of the alternative La mRNA .
Using the 5'-RACE technique , the transcription start was determined to locate 235 nt upstream of the oligo ( dT ) -stretch , which is 68 nt downstream of the exon 1 but still within the intron between exon 1 and exon 2 ( Fig .
4 B ) .
By consequence , the La gene might contain two promotor sites .
One upstream of the exon 1 and an alternative promotor within the intron downstream of the exon 1 ' .
Indeed searching for hypothetical transcription factor binding sites ( Fig .
5 ) a hypothetical TFIID binding site was identified to locate -37 nt upstream of the determined transcriptional start site ( Figs .
4 and 5 ) .
A Mechanism Leading to the Alternative La mRNA Form .
- In summary , we conclude that the alternative La mRNA is transcribed from an alternative promoter within the intron and represents the result of an alternative splicing event .
The proposed mechanism leading to the two forms of La mRNAs is schematically summarized in Fig .
6 as follows : when the promotor upstream of exon 1 is used , the complete intron between exons 1 and 2 including the exon 1 ' sequence locating within the intron is removed during splicing .
If the promotor upstream of exon 1 ' but downstream of the exon 1 is used , then ( a ) the exon 1 is not transcribed and ( b ) an alternative donor splice site within the intron is spliced to the same acceptor splice site at the exon 2 .
At the mRNA level this results in a complete exchange of the exon 1 by the exon 1 ' .
Properties of the Resulting Alternative La mRNA .
- One major difference between the two types of La mRNAs is based on the existence of three ATGs in the exon 1 ' .
As shown in Fig .
7 , there are two stop codons in the reading frame of the first ATG .
The second ATG is in the +1 and the third ATG in the -1 frame .
Interestingly , upstream of the first ATG there are two GC-rich regions .
Further Properties of the Analyzed Genomic Region of the La Gene .
Based on the presence of the oligo ( dT ) -tail and of a further homopolymeric sequence , an oligo ( dA ) -tail of 26 ( A ) -residues ( nt 1905-1930 ; EMBL accession number 235127 ) , which locates downstream of an Alu repeat ( nt 1604-1904 ) , we asked whether the alternative 5 terminus represents a part of a pseudogene .
Comparison with the EMBL Data Library resulted in the identification of a sequence element of 89 nt starting 153 nt upstream of the oligo ( dT ) -tail , which has homologies in the range of 65 % to the reversed sequence of the avian myelocytomatosis provirus and pseudorabies virus ( Fig .
8 ) .
The region of homology to the avian myelocytomatosis virus locates within the v-myc region of the gag-myc fusion protein .
Discussion Frequently sera of patients with pSS and SLE contain au-toantibodies .
One of the targets of the ANAs is the nuclear autoantigen La/SS-B ( 7 ) .
Different mechanisms had been discussed for the development of the autoantibodies directed to Alternative Transcript Encoding for the Autoantigen La/SS-B FA _Exo '' ~ +/ Figure 6 .
Origin of the two different forms of La mRNAs .
The La gene contains two alternative transcription start sites ( 4 ) .
In the case of the exon 1 containing La mRNA the transcription start was originally determined with primer extension ( 17 ) .
This site was confirmed by the use of the 5-RACE technique .
The same technique was used to determine the initiation site of the exon 1 ' type La mRNA .
It was found to locate in the intron downstream of the exon 1 .
By consequence , the two forms are expressed as follows : when the promotor upstream of exon Genomic level 10 20 30 40 50 5 ' TTTCCGTTCT TTACTGCTTC TCGCéGcGTC CeTCceccee TCeccTTCcT 60 70 80 90 100 CACGTTCAGG CCGAGCGCCG CGTGGGCCG @ c AGCCGGAGGC _ GGCGGAGCCG 110 120 130 140 150 AGGGGGCGCG GGCGGCGece AGGCTGCCCC CGCGAGGAAT GCGGGATCCT 0 M R D__P 160 170 180 190 200 GGGGTTCCCC GCACGTGGCT GGTGCCCAGG CAGTTCCGCG GTTGCTTAGA 0 G V P R T W L V__P_ R g_ F_R G A L E 210 220 230 240 250 GACGGGACTG TGGCTGCCCT CATCCCCATT GCGTCTTTTT TTTTTITTTT 0 T G L w__L _ _P S $ _ _P_ L R L F FFP F F 260 270 280 290 300 TTTTTTTTAC CTCCACCGCC TTCTAGTCTC ACCGAAGGCT TGTGGeCCATC 0 F_F_T 5 T A Fo* s H R R IL V A I 310 320 330 340 350 TCTGTAAAGT TTCTGGGGAG GTGGGCACGG GGTAAACGCC GGAGGGTTCT 0 § V K F L G R Wo A R G K R R R V I 360 370 3580 390 400 GTGGAGCCTA TGGGACTGAC TGGAGGCCAA AGAACTTTGG GCCGCAGATG 0 ow § L - W D * Lo E A Ko E Lo W A A D Vv -1 M +1 M__G L T G 6 g R T L G R RC 410 420 430 440 450 TACACCAGCG TCACTCTTTT GGTCTGTTAG GGCCTTCATC GCTCACATCA 0 Ho Q R HS F G L L G P S S Lo T S -1 ¥ T s Vv T L L v _C * +1 T _P A $ _ L F _W 5 V R A F _I A HI R 460 470 _ & - ago 490 500 GGTTTCAGTG TGAAACGGGA AAACATAGCC GCAATGGCTG AAAATGGTGA 0 G F s v K R E N I A A M A OE N G D +1 _C E T G K H S R N G * * 0 * 510 520 530 540 550 TAATGAAAAG ATGGCTGCCC TGGAGGCCAA AATCTGTCAT CAAATTGAGT 0 N E K M A A L E A K I C H q I E Y Figure 7 .

The ( ) marks the splice junction 2065 Troster et al .
1 is used , the complete intron between exon 1 and exon 2 , including the exon 1 ' sequence locating within the intron , is removed during splicing .
If the promotor upstream of exon 1 ' but downstream of the exon 1 is used , ( a ) the exon 1 is not transcribed and ( b ) an alternative donor splice mRNA site within the intron is spliced to the same acceptor splice level site at the exon 2 .
Thereby the exon 1 is replaced by the exon 1 ' .
One major difference between the two types of La mRNAs is based on the fact that the translation initiation site of the exon 1 type La mRNA locates in the exon 2 , since the exon 1 does not contain an ATG sequence .
In contrast , the exon 1 ' contains three further ATGs .
the nuclear antigen La/SS-B including either a molecular mimicry with ( retro ) viral epitopes or an antigen driven mechanism ( 5 , 6 ) .
In case of an autoantigen driven mechanism alterations in patients with respect to the expression of the autoantigen should occur .
However , such pathophysiological alterations had not been described up to now .
Therefore we started to analyze the expression of the La gene searching for alternative transcripts overexpressed in patients .
For that purpose a cDNA library was made from PBL of the patient ( Ma ; 8 ) with pSS and the library was screened with her own autoimmune serum .
Thereby a novel form of La mRNA was identified .
The two isolated alternative La cDNAs differed from the hitherto known La cDNA sequence at the 5¢ terminus .
Both alternative La cDNAs started with an unusual 5'-oligo ( dT ) -tail and lacked the exon 1 sequence .
Instead of the exon 1 an alternative 5'-terminal sequence which was termed as exon 1 , was found .
Using the technique of Southern blotting , an EcoRI fragment was identified to contain the exon 1 ' in healthy donors as well as in patients .
Therefore , we concluded that the exon 1 '' is not a patient-specific insert .
The 4.8-kb fragment containing the exon 1 '' was subcloned from a genomic A clone into pBluescript and sequenced .
Thereby the exon 1 ' including its oligo ( dT ) -tail was found to be a part of the intron between exons 1 and 2 .
As the oligo ( dT ) was also found within the genomic sequence , the presence of the oligo ( dT ) -tail at the 5 '' terminus of the cDNAs is not the result of a cloning artifact , although it must be mentioned that the length found for the genomic oligo ( dT ) -tail ( 23 [ dTJ-residues ) was smaller than the length of the oligo ( dT ) -tails of the cDNAs ( 31 [ dT ] -residues in the between exon 1 ' and exon 2 .
The proposed aa sequence of the La protein ( 13 ) , if translation starts at the first ATG in the exon 2 ( bold ; nt 484 ) .

- Sequence homologies of the 5'-end upstream of the oligo ( dT ) -tail .
Comparisons of the reversed sequence upstream of the oligo ( dT ) -tail with the EMBL DNA Data Library revealed homologies of ( a ) 67.5 % to a 83 bp overlap within the v-myc region of the avian myelocytomatosis HBI provirus ( reacmh ; EMBL accession number M11784 ) ; ( b ) 60.8 % homology to a 120 bp overlap encoding for the gag-myc fusion protein of the avian myelocytomatosis virus of the same region ( remc ; EMBL accession numbers VO1174 and JO2247 ) ; or ( c ) 64 % homology to a 125-bp overlap of an immediate-early gene of pseudorabies virus ( kepvie ; EMBL accession number X15120 ) .
case of La19 and 52 in the case of La23 ) .
In fact these differences may have resulted during the cloning procedure .
By comparing the La cDNA sequences with the genomic sequence all the used splice sites became evident , including the exon 1 intron donor splice site , the alternative exon 1 ' intron donor splice site and the common intron exon 2 acceptor splice site .
As the genomic sequence contains a 1443-nt-long intron between the 3'-end of the exon 1 ' and the start of the exon 2 , which is absent in the sequence of the La cDNAs La19 and La23 , it is clear that these La cDNAs 2066 must have been derived from alternatively spliced La mRNAs .
Using the 5-RACE technique the transcription initiation site of the alternative La mRNA was determined to locate 68 nt downstream of the exon 1 donor splice site .
According to this result , the transcription of the alternative La mRNA starts within the intron between exon 1 and exon 1 ' .
Therefore , an alternative promotor might locate upstream of this alternative transcription initiation site .
Indeed , searching for putative transcription factor binding sites resulted in the identification of a putative TFIID binding site at the expected position ( Fig .
5 ) .
It is interesting to note that in addition to the TFIID binding site a series of further consensus sequences for other transcription factors , which could be involved in regulation of a differential expression of the two types of La mRNAs , exists in the intron downstream of the exon 1 as summarized in Fig .
5 .
These transcription factor binding sites include common transcription factors such as SP1 but also of the AP1 and AP2 family .
Of most interest is the presence of a NF-KB element 218 nt downstream of the exon 1 , as NF-KB is known to be activated by UV irradi-ation , dsRNA , acute phase proteins , including some inter-leukins , interferons , tumor necrosis factor , and retroviruses ( 26 ) .
Moreover , NF- « B elements also exist in retroviruses and are assumed to be involved in activation of retroviruses , viral latency , and development of autoimmunity .
The NF- « B element in the La gene ( 5-GGGGTTCCCC ) is very similar to the NF-KB binding site in the HIV virus ( 5-GGGGAT TCCCC ) , which has been described to cause symptoms similar to pSS ( 4 ) .
Taken together , the conditions known to activate NF- « B are the conditions known to cause and induce acute disease in SLE patients .
Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that here could be a first hint for a link between the development of disease as well as inducers of acute disease and an alternative expression of the gene encoding for the autoantigen La/SS-B .
In summary our genomic data show that the mechanism leading to the alternative form of La mRNA includes a promotor switching and an alternative splicing event .
At present the function of the alternative La mRNA remains obscure , as the complete exon 1 ' as determined with the 5'-RACE experiment does not only contain the unusual oligo ( dT ) -tail , but also two GC-rich regions and three ATGs .
However , there are two stop codons in the reading frame of the first ATG .
Moreover , the second and the third ATG are not in the correct reading frame ( Fig .
7 ) .
Similar looking alternative transcripts had been described for other housekeeping proteins .
In these cases it had been suggested that the alternative transcripts either are not translated into protein but should throttle the translation or represent stored intermediates for a further tissue-dependent 5'-terminal processing ( 18 ) .
By consequence , future studies are required to clarify the physiological function of the alternative La mRNA .
Moreover , the behavior under pathophysiological conditions must be elucidated .
For example it is well established that active retroviruses take use of read through of stop codons and ribosomal frame shiftings during translation of their proteins .
Alternative Transcript Encoding for the Autoantigen La/SS-B So it is tempting to speculate that similar events could occur during translation of the alternative La mRNA in retroviral infected cells leading to NH ; terminally altered La proteins , which could finally induce the autoimmune reactions against the La protein .
