Gollob , '' Claudia P. Schnipper , Erin A. Murphy , Jerome Ritz , and David A. Frank IL-12 and IL-2 can stimulate mitogen- or CD3-activated T cells to proliferate , produce IFN-y , and kill tumor cells .
The magnitude of these functional responses is greatly augmented when T cells are activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .
Although peripheral blood T cells are largely unresponsive to these cytokines without prior activation , a small subset of CD8* T cells ( CDS* CD18® '' * ) is strongly activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .
In this report we show that the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 in CD8¢ CD18 '' '' ® '' * T cells correlates with the activation of the stress kinases , p38 mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase and stress-activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) /Jun N-terminal kinase , but not with the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases .
The functional synergy between IL-2 and IL-12 is also associated with a prominent increase in STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation over that observed with IL-12 or IL-2 alone .
By contrast , STAT tyrosine phosphorylation is not augmented over that seen with either cytokine alone .
A specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase completely inhibits the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 induced by IL-12 and IL-2 and abrogates the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 without affecting STAT tyrosine phosphorylation .
This suggests that p38 MAP kinase may play an important role in regulating STAT serine phosphorylation in response to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .
Furthermore , these findings indicate that the optimal activation of T cells by IL-12 and IL-2 may depend on an interaction between the p38 MAP kinase and Janus kinase/STAT signaling pathways .
effects on T cell activation .
To respond to either IL-12 or IL-2 , T cells must first be activated with a mitogen such as PHA or through ligation of the TCR/CD3 complex ( 1 ) .
One of the primary mechanisms through which T cell activation confers responsiveness to IL-12 or IL-2 is through the up-regulation of the receptor subunits for these cytokines ( 2-5 ) .
Although both cytokines stimulate cytolytic activity ( 6 ) , proliferation ( 7 , 8 ) , and IFN-y production ( 9 ) by activated T cells , the magnitudes of these functional effects elicited by IL-12 and IL-2 are different .
For ex-ample , while IL-2 is the more potent stimulator of proliferation and cytolytic activity ( 7 , 10 , 11 ) , IL-12 is a stronger inducer of IFN-y production .
In addition , IL-12 differs from IL-2 in its ability to promote the differentiation of CD4 * T cells into Th1 cells ( 12 , 13 ) .
The stimulation of T cells with IL-12 and IL-2 together has an additive effect on cytolytic activity and a synergistic effect on proliferation and IFN-y production ( 8 , 9 ) .
While resting T cells are largely unresponsive to IL-12 or IL-2 , a small number of resting T cells appear to be capable of producing IFN-y when stimulated with the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 ( 9 ) .

The effects of IL-12 and IL-2 on T cell function reflect the similarities and differences in the signaling pathways that are activated in T cells by these cytokines .
Among the MAP '' kinases , IL-2 has been shown to activate extracellular signal-regulated ki-nase-1 ( ERK1 ) and ERK2 in T cells ( 14 , 15 ) as well as p38 MAP kinase in a murine T cell line ( 16 ) , while IL-12 can activate ERK 1 in T cells ( 17 ) .
However , it is not known whether ERK or p38 MAP kinase activation plays a role in IL-2- or IL-12-mediated cytolytic activity or IFN-y production in T cells .
One report has suggested that ERK2 activation is necessary but not sufficient for IL-2-induced T cell proliferation ( 14 ) .
Several other studies have implicated p38 MAP kinase in the proliferative response of T cells to IL-2 and IL-7 ( 16 ) and in the induction of IL-6 production by TNF-a ( 18 ) .
IL-12 and IL-2 also activate both distinct and overlapping components of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in activated T cells .
Whereas IL-12 activates JAK2 and Tyk2 , IL-2 activates JAK 1 and JAK3 ( 19 ) .
STAT1 , STAT3 , and STATS ( 20 , 21 ) are activated in response to IL-2 , while STAT1 , STAT3 , STAT4 , and STATS can all be activated in response to IL-12 in T cells ( 20 , 22 , 23 ) .
The important role of JAK/STAT signaling in mediating the functional effects of IL-12 has been demonstrated by the phenotype of STAT4 knockout mice ( 24 ) .
In mice lacking STAT4 , all the major functional effects of IL-12 on T and NK cells are markedly inhib-ited .
The importance of JAK/STAT signaling in lymphocyte IL-2 responsiveness has been shown by the diminished functional response to IL-2 in JAK3 and STATS5 knockout mice ( 25 , 26 ) .
In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation , cytokines can induce the 3 Abbreviations used in this paper : MAP , mitogen-activated protein ; JAK , Janus kinase ; PE , phycoerythrin ; ATF-2 , activating transcription factor-2 ; ERK , extracellular signal-regulated kinase ; SAPK , stress-activated protein kinase .

The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 's is required for dimerization , nuclear translocation , and DNA binding and is therefore necessary to induce STAT-responsive gene transcription .
In addition , STAT serine phosphorylation may be an important modulator of both STAT DNA binding and STAT-mediated transcriptional activity ( 27 , 28 ) .
However , the relative importance of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation vs STAT serine phosphorylation in the functional response of T cells to cytokines remains undefined .
Several cytokines have been shown to induce STAT serine phosphorylation in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation .
IL-2 can induce the serine phosphorylation of STATS ( 29 ) , whereas IL-6 ( 30 ) and IFN-y ( 27 ) can stimulate STAT3 and STAT1 serine phosphorylation , respectively .
Both IL-12 and IFN-a stimulate STAT4 serine phosphorylation ( 31 ) .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 's induced by IL-12 or IL-2 is mediated by the Janus family kinases that associate with IL-12 or IL-2 receptor subunits and are activated following receptor ligation .
However , the serine/threonine kinase ( s ) responsible for cytokine-induced STAT serine phosphorylation in lymphocytes has not been identified .
While epidermal growth factor-in-duced STAT3 serine phosphorylation in a fibroblast cell line appears to be mediated by ERK ( 30 ) , STAT3 serine phosphorylation by IL-6 in HepG2 cells ( 30 ) and STATS serine phosphorylation by IL-2 in a human T cell line ( 29 ) were both found to occur independently of ERK activation .
In human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells , the constitutive serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was found to also occur independently of ERK activation ( 32 ) .
It is not known whether other serine/threonine kinases such as p38 MAP kinase or stress-activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) /JNK may be capable of mediating cytokine-induced STAT serine phosphorylation in T cells .
Although the JAK/STAT and MAP kinase family signaling pathways appear to play important roles in the functional response of T cells to IL-2 and IL-12 , very little is known about the signaling mechanism that underlies the functional synergy observed between IL-12 and IL-2 .
One report found that IFN-y mRNA transcripts were stabilized in lymphocytes stimulated with IL-12 and IL-2 ( 33 ) , suggesting that this might be responsible for the synergistic increase in IFN-y production .
Although there is evidence that the functional synergy between IL-12 and IFN-y-inducing factor ( IL-18 ) is partly mediated through the IL-12-induced up-regulation of IL-18R ( 34 ) , the synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 does not appear to be mediated at the level of cytokine receptor expression .
We wanted to determine whether the synergistic activation of T cells by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 was mediated through the modulation of JAK/STAT and/or MAP kinase family signaling .
By examining the activation of these signaling pathways in a subset of peripheral blood T cells that respond poorly to IL-12 or IL-2 alone but demonstrate strong functional responsiveness to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 , we show that the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 is dependent upon the activation of p38 MAP kinase .
In addition , we show that the functional synergy correlates with the augmentation of STAT serine phosphorylation and provide evidence that STAT serine phosphorylation induced by IL-12 and IL-2 may be mediated by p38 MAP kinase .
Materials and Methods Abs and cytokines The following unconjugated and PE- or FITC-conjugated Abs were obtained from Coulter ( Hialeah , FL ) : negative control , anti-CD4 , anti-CD8 , anti-CD56 ( NKH1 ) , and anti-€CD20 ( B1 ) .
Anti-CD18 ( 8C12 , IgM ) has been previously described ( 7 ) and does not activate resting or PHA-stim-ulated T cells .
In addition , it does not augment the response of resting or PHA-activated T cells to IL-12 or IL-2 .
8C12 was used as a 1/400 dilution 4473 of mouse ascites .
FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM was purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates ( Birmingham , AL ) .
Unconjugated anti-CD4 ( 19thy1 ) and anti-CD56 ( N901 ) Abs were used as dilutions of mouse ascites .
The phospho-STAT1 Ab recognizes the tyrosine 701-phosphorylated forms of STAT1a and STAT1RB and cross-reacts with the tyrosine 694-phosphorylated form of STATS ( 20 , 35 , 36 ) .
The phospho-STAT3 Ab recognizes the tyrosine 705-phosphorylated form of STAT3 .
The phosphoserine-STAT1 and phosphoserine-STAT3 Abs specifically recognize the serine 727-phosphorylated forms of STAT1 and STAT3 , respectively ( 32 ) .
Anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase , anti-p38 MAP kinase , anti-phospho- SAPK/ JNK , anti-SAPK/JNK , anti-phospho-ERK1/ERK2 , anti-ERK1/ERK2 , anti-phospho- MKK3/MKK6 , and anti-phospho-ATF-2 were all purchased from New England Biolabs ( Beverly , MA ) .

The Abs to STAT1 and STAT3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) .
Recombinant human IL-12 ( sp .
act. , 1.7 X 10 '' U/mg ) was provided by Dr. Steven Herrmann at Genetics Institute ( Cambridge , MA ) .

act. , 3.9 X 10° U/ml ) was provided by Amgen ( Thousand Oaks , CA ) .
The p38 MAP kinase inhibitor ( SB203580 ) has been described previously and was provided by Dr. John C. Lee ( SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals , King of Prussia , PA ) .

The MEK inhibitor PD98059 was purchased from New England Biolabs .
Isolation of PBMC and T cell subsets Blood samples enriched for white blood cells were obtained from normal volunteer donors undergoing platelet pheresis in the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Blood Bank .
PBMC were isolated from blood samples through density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Hypaque ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) .
For the isolation of CD18® '' ® '' * and CD18 '' T cells subsets , PBMC were first depleted of monocytes through passage over a nylon wool col-umn .
For the preparation of CD # -enriched T cells , monocyte-depleted PBMC were depleted of CD4* T cells , B cells , and NK cells using Abs to lineage-specific markers ( anti-CD4 , anti-CD20 , and anti-CD56 ) and magnetic beads coated with anti-mouse Ig Abs ( Advanced Magnetics , Cambridge , MA ) .
CD # 8-enriched T cell preparations were then stained with CD18-FITC and CD8-PE , and PE-positive cells were separated on a FACS ( Coulter EPICS Elite ESP ) into CD18 '' ® '' * and CD18 '' populations based on CD18-FITC fluorescence intensity ( CD18® '' ®** cells routinely had a CD18-FITC mean fluorescence intensity 5-6 times greater than CD18 '' cells ) .
Another method for obtaining CD18 '' '' ®** T cells involved the use of PBMC depleted of monocytes alone .
These cells were stained with CD18-FITC as well as PE-conjugated anti-CD56 and anti-CD20 Abs .
PE-nega-tive cells were then sorted based on CD18-FITC fluorescence intensity .
Through this method , CD18 '' ®** T cells were 0 % CD56* , 100 % CD3* , 95-98 % TCR « B* , and > 90 % CD8* .
Cell sorting routinely yielded a maximum of 3-4 X 10° CD18® '' ® '' * and CD18 '' T cells/experiment .
T cell stimulation and preparation of whole cell lysates for Western blots Sorted T cells were washed and stimulated for 15 min at 37°C in a total volume of 800 pl under the following conditions : medium alone ( RPMI 1640 and 2.5 % FCS ) , 100 pM IL-12 , 100 pM IL-2 , or IL-12 plus IL-2 .
Approximately 0.75-1.0 X 10° sorted T cells were used per condition .
For experiments involving the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor , cells were incubated in medium with either 1-10 M $ B203580 or DMSO vehicle for 1 h at 37°C before addition of cytokine .
For experiments involving the MEK inhibitor PD98059 , cells were incubated in medium alone or 50 uM PD98059 for 1 h at 37°C before addition of cytokine .
For experiments with PMA ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) , CD8-enriched T cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml PMA for 15 min .
After stimulation , cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and then lysed on ice for 20 min in lysis buffer containing 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 50 mM Tris ( pH 8.0 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 2 pg/ml aprotinin , 100 ug/ml PMSF , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , and 1 mM NaF .
Whole cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 2 % reducing sample buffer and boiled , and proteins were resolved on a 10 % polyacrylamide gel .
For Western blots , proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Schleicher and Schuell , Keene , NH ) by electroblotting , and membranes were then blocked for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 % Tween-20 ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) and either 5 % BSA ( U.S. Biochemical Corp. , Cleveland , OH ) or 5 % nonfat dried milk .
Membranes were 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 4474 incubated with dilutions of the indicated Abs for 1 h at room temperature , washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20 , incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit Abs ( di-luted 1/10,000 ) for 1 h , washed again , and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham , Aylesbury , U.K. ) .
When reprobed , membranes were first stripped by incubating in a solution containing 2 % SDS , 100 mM 2-ME , and 62.5 mM Tris-HCI ( pH 6.7 ) for 30 min at 65°C .
Proliferation assays and measurement of IFN-y production Sorted T cells were incubated in 96-well U-bottom plates at 3 X 10° cells/ well with medium alone or the indicated concentration of cytokines at 37°C .
For experiments involving the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor , 1-10 uM $ B203580 or DMSO vehicle was added at the same time as the cytokines .
Proliferation assays were performed as previously described and consisted of a 96-h incubation , with 1 [ H ] thymidine ( DuPont-New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) added 8 h before harvesting .
For IFN-y assays , supernatants were harvested after a 72-h incubation , and the IFN-y concentration assayed using an IFN-y ELISA ( Endogen , Cambridge , MA ) .
Cytotoxicity assays Sorted CD8 * CD18 '' '' ® '' * T cells were first incubated overnight in 96-well , U-bottom plates with either medium alone or the indicated cytokines at 37°C before the addition of target cells .
For experiments involving the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor , 1-10 M $ B203580 was added at the same time as the cytokines .
COLO or OKT3 cells were labeled with *'Cr and added to the T cells at a 5:1 E : T cell ratio .
T cells were incubated with the labeled target cells for 4 h at 37°C , and the supernatants were harvested .
*'Cr release was assayed using a gamma counter , and the percent specific cytotoxicity was calculated as previously described ( 11 ) .
Results p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/INK are activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 in CD18 '' T cells To identify the signaling pathways that mediate the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 in T cells , we examined a subset of peripheral blood T cells that are unique in their ability to respond to these cytokines .
The majority of freshly isolated peripheral blood T cells , in the absence of additional activation , do not respond to IL-12 , IL-2 , or the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .
These T cells have a naive phenotype , which includes the relatively weak expression of CD18 ( CD18 ) .
However , we have recently identified a subset of CD8* T cells ( CD8 * CD18 '' ® '' '' ) that express intermediate affinity IL-2R as well as IL-12R and that expand in vivo in cancer patients receiving IL-12 ( 37 ) .
In vitro , these T cells respond weakly to IL-12 or IL-2 alone .
However , they are strongly activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 to proliferate and produce IFN-y .
In addition , stimulation of these CD8 * T cells with IL-12 and IL-2 augments non-MHC-restricted as well as CD3-mediated killing of tumor cells .
Recent reports have suggested that small subpopulations of peripheral blood lymphocytes in mice , including Val4 NKT cells and CD8 `` CD44 '' T cells , may mediate the antitumor effect of IL-12 ( 38 ) and virus-induced bystander T cell proliferation ( 39 ) , respectively .
In humans , the CD8 T cells may play a key role in both innate and acquired immunity to infectious pathogens and tumors by virtue of their dual ability to undergo TCR-independent activation via stimulation with cytokine combinations such as IL-12 and IL-2 or IL-12 and IL-15 and to be activated through the TCR by specific Ags .
In addition , these T cells may mediate the antitumor effect of cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-2 that are administered to patients with cancer .
As CD8*CD18 '' '' ® '' * T cells can uniquely respond to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 without first requiring additional in vitro activation with mitogens or CD3 ligation ( 37 ) , the signaling pathways triggered by IL-12 and IL-2 can be analyzed without concern for any artifact that might be introduced by prior in vitro manipulation .

A and B , Combined stimulation with IL-12 and IL-2 synergistically augments the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the 25-40 kDa range .
Sorted CD18 '' '' ® '' * T cells were stimulated for 15 min with medium alone ( Zane 7 ) , 100 pM IL-12 ( Zane 2 ) , 100 pM IL-2 ( lane 3 ) , or IL-12 and IL-2 ( Zane 4 ) and then lysed with 1 % Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer .
A Western blot was then performed on whole cell lysates ( 1 X 10° cells/ lane ) using an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab .
Results are representative of two separate experiments .
CD18 '' T cells , we first examined the pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to these cytokines .
CD8 *CD18° '' '' = '' * and CD8 `` CD18 '' T cells were isolated separately through FACS and stimulated with medium alone , IL-12 , IL-2 , or IL-12 plus IL-2 .
Cells were lysed , and a Western blot was performed on whole cell lysates using a phosphotyrosine-specific Ab .
In T cells , although the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in the 60-130 kDa range was observed in response to IL-2 alone ( Fig .
1A , lane 3 ) , there was no further increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of those proteins in response to IL-12 and IL-2 ( Fig .
1A , lane 4 ) .
In contrast , several proteins in the range of 25-42 kDa were strongly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 ( Fig .
1B , lane 4 ) but were only weakly tyrosine phosphorylated or were not phosphorylated at all in response to IL-2 alone ( Fig .
1B , lane 3 ) .
Protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-12 , IL-2 , or IL-12 plus IL-2 was not detected in CD18 '' T cells ( data not shown ) .
The increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the 38-42 kDa range in response to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 raised the possibility that activation of ERK1/ERK2 ( p44/p42 ) or p38 MAP kinase in CD8 *CD18° '' ® '' * T cells was in part mediating the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 .
To determine whether IL-12 or IL-2 could activate a MAP kinase family mem-ber , sorted CD18 '' and CD18 T cells were stimulated with medium alone , IL-12 , IL-2 , or IL-12 plus IL-2 .
Western blots were performed on whole cell lysates using Abs that recognize the activated , phosphorylated forms of p38 MAP kinase , SAPK/JNK , or ERK1/ERK2 .
Low level , constitutive activation of p38 MAP kinase was present in CD18 '' and CD18 T cells ( Fig .

Neither IL-12 nor IL-2 alone consistently activated p38 MAP kinase in CD18 '' cells ( Fig .
24 , lanes 2 and 3 ) or CD18 '' cells ( Fig .

However , the stimulation of CD18 '' ® '' * T cells with the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 markedly increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology FIGURE 2. p38 MAP kinase and A SAPK/JINK are activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 , whereas ERK1 CD1 gbright 4475 CD1§8dim and ERK2 are not .

In addition to the differential effect of the IL-12 and IL-2 combination on p38 MAP kinase activation in CD18 '' ® '' * and CD18 '' cells , p38 MAP kinase expression was also much higher in CD18 '' ® '' * T cells compared with CD18 '' cells ( Fig .

A similar pattern of activation was observed for SAPK/JNK .
Whereas low level constitutive activation was seen in CD18 '' =* '' * and CD18 '' subsets , strong activation by IL-12 and IL-2 of the p54 and p46 SAPK/JNK isoforms occurred only in CD18 '' ® '' * T cells ( Fig .

In contrast with p38 MAP kinase , SAPK/ JNK expression was similar in CD18 '' ® '' * and CD18 '' cells ( Fig .

Although it has been reported that IL-2 and IL-12 can activate ERK1/ERK2 in mitogen-activated T cells , no activation of ERK1 or ERK2 was detected in CD18 '' '' ® '' * '' * or CD18 '' cells in response to IL-12 , IL-2 , or IL-12 and IL-2 ( Fig .

This was not due to the absence of ERK1/ERK2 , as similar amounts of ERK1 and ERK2 were present in CD8 *CD18 '' '' ® '' * and CD8 `` CD18 '' T cells ( Fig .

This was also not due to a defect in the ERK signaling pathway , as the phorbol ester PMA was able to activate ERK2 in these same CD8 * T cells ( Fig .

The dual spec-ificity protein kinases MKK3 and MKK6 are phosphorylated in response to cellular stresses or inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- « and IL-1 and , in turn , selectively activate p38 MAP kinase through phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues ( 40 , 41 ) .
In CD18 '' ® '' * T cells , there was low level basal activation of MKK3/6 , which was not appreciably augmented with stimulation by IL-12 or IL-2 ( Fig .
3 , lanes 1-3 , upper panel ) .
However , stimulation with IL-12 plus IL-2 strongly activated MKK3/6 ( Fig .
3 , lane 4 ) .
This suggested that the synergistic activation of p38 MAP kinase by IL-12 and IL-2 was mediated through MKK3/6 .
Both p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK activate ATF-2 through the phosphorylation of threonine residues ( 42 , 43 ) .
To demonstrate that the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK in response to IL-12 plus IL-2 augmented the activity of these serine/threonine kinases , we examined whether ATF-2 phosphorylation was increased by stimulation with IL-12 and IL-2 .
As was observed with MKK3/6 , there was low level basal phosphorylation of ATF-2 in CD18 '' = '' * T cells ( Fig .

MKK3/MKK6 and ATF-2 are synergistically activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .

Western blots were performed on whole cell lysates using an Ab specific for the activated , phosphorylated form of MKK3/MKK6 ( upper panel ) or an Ab specific for the phosphorylated form of ATF-2 ( lower panel ) .
Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments .
IL-2 ( lane 4 , lower panel ) but not in response to IL-12 or IL-2 alone ( lanes 2 and 3 , lower panel ) .
This suggests that the activation of p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK in response to IL-2 plus IL-12 is associated with the phosphorylation of a physiologic substrate in these cells .
The serine phosphorylation , but not the tyrosine phosphorylation , of STAT1 and STAT3 is synergistically increased by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 in CD18 '' T cells In addition to the activation of components of MAP kinase family pathways , signaling through cytokine receptors in lymphocytes also involves the activation of components of the JAK/STAT pathway .
To determine whether the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 could augment STAT activation in CD18 '' '' ® '' * T cells in the same manner as p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK activation , we stimulated CD18 '' ® '' * and CD18 '' T cells with IL-12 , IL-2 , or IL-12 plus IL-2 .
The cytokine-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 , STAT5 , and STAT3 was then analyzed by performing Western blots on whole cell lysates using Abs that specifically recognize the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of these STAT 's .
No tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 , STAT5 , or STAT3 was observed in response to IL-12 and/or IL-2 in sorted CD18 '' T cells ( data not shown ) .
Among CD18 '' ® '' * T cells , IL-12 and IL-2 each induced the weak tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 ( Fig .
4 , A and B , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
IL-2 , but not IL-12 , induced the relatively strong tyrosine phosphorylation of STATS ( Fig .
44 , lane 3 ) .
Stimulation with the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 did not further increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of these STATs over that which was observed with IL-12 or IL-2 alone ( Fig .
4 , A and B , lane 4 ) .
Thus , the functional synergy between IL-2 and IL-12 is not associated with changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of these STAT 's .
Given our findings of enhanced p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/ JNK activation in response to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 , we examined the effects of IL-12 and IL-2 on the serine phosphorylation of STAT 's using Abs that specifically recognize the serine-phosphorylated forms of STAT1 and STAT3 .
Stimulation of sorted CD18 T cells with IL-12 and IL-2 , alone or together , did not result in the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT3 ( data not shown ) .
The stimulation of CD18 '' ® '' * T cells with IL-12 or IL-2 weakly increased the serine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3 over the basal levels ( Fig .
5 , A and B , upper panels , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
However , the combined stimulation with IL-12 plus IL-2 resulted in a striking increase in the levels of STAT1 and IL-12/IL-2 SYNERGISM INVOLVES p38 MAP KINASE/STAT ACTIVATION A IL-12 + = IL-12 IL-2 IL-2 « - o-phospho-Stat5 < - a-phospho-Static < 4- a-phospho-Statif 1 2 3 4 IL-12 + = IL-12 IL-2 IL-2 ous - e. < -- o-phospho-Stat3 1 2 3 4 FIGURE 4 .

Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments .
STAT3 serine phosphorylation over that observed with either cytokine alone ( Fig .

This increase in STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation was not due to an increase in the total amount of STAT1 or STAT3 protein ( Fig .
5 , A and B , lower panels ) .
An inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase abrogates the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in response to IL-12 plus IL-2 , while a MEK inhibitor has no effect Since the augmentation of STAT serine phosphorylation by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 in CD18 '' ® '' * T cells was associated with a strong increase in p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK activation by IL-12 and IL-2 , we hypothesized that one or both of these serine/threonine kinases might be mediating the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 .
Although a specific pharma-cologic inhibitor of SAPK/JNK is not available , a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase ( $ B203580 ) has been described .
The p38 MAP kinase has been shown to be activated by IL-2 in a murine T cell line ( 16 ) and by TNF-a in L929 cells ( 18 ) .
SB203580 at a concentration of 10 M has been shown to maximally inhibit IL-2-induced proliferation and TNF- « -induced cytokine production in these cell lines .
Used at concentrations ranging from 0.1-1 mM , $ B203580 inhibits the IL-2-induced activation of MAP kinase activating protein by p38 MAP kinase without inhibiting the IL-2-induced activation of ATF-2 by SAPK/JNK in a murine T cell line ( 16 ) .
Even at SB203580 concentrations of 10-20 uM , p38 MAP kinase is selectively inhibited in T cells ( 16 ) and mouse fibroblasts ( 44 ) , while ERK and SAPK/JNK activity remain unaffected .
To determine whether p38 MAP kinase was mediating the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in response to IL-12 plus IL-2 , sorted CD18 '' ® '' * T cells were stimulated with IL-12 plus IL-2 in the presence of 10 wM $ B203580 or vehicle ( DMSO ) alone .
As shown in Fig .
64 , the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 greatly increased the serine phosphorylation of STAT and STAT3 over the low to absent basal serine phosphorylation ( Zanes 1 and 2 , top and middle panels ) .
When cells were incubated with 10 wM $ B203580 alone , an increase in the amount of basal STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation could be detected ( Fig .
6A , top and middle panels , lane 5 ) .

In contrast , STAT tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-12 or IL-2 was not affected by $ B203580 ( data not shown ) .
This suggested that p38 MAP kinase activity was necessary for STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation in response to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .
Since neither ERK 1 nor ERK2 was activated by IL-12 and IL-2 , it was unlikely that the ERK MAP kinase pathway was mediating the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in response to IL-12 and IL-2 .
To further demonstrate this point , CD18 '' ® '' * T cells were stimulated with IL-12 plus IL-2 in the presence of a MEK inhibitor ( PD98059 ) , which prevents the phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/ERK2 .
As shown in Fig .

The inhibition of p38 MAP kinase abolishes the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 in CD8¢ CD18 '' '' * '' T cells To determine whether the activation of p38 MAP kinase is essential to the functional response of CD8 T cells to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 , sorted T cells were stimulated with IL-12 and/or IL-2 in the presence or the absence of $ B203580 .
IFN-y production was assessed after 72 h , and proliferation was assessed after 96 h. As shown in Fig .

In addition , non-MHC-restricted cytolytic activity against the COLO cell line induced by IL-12 or IL-2 was reduced by $ B203580 ( Fig .

Discussion To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the synergistic activation of T cells by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 , we have examined two of the signaling pathways activated by IL-12 and IL-2 .
Rather than using T cell lines or T cells activated in vitro with mitogens or CD3 cross-linking to analyze the signaling pathways activated by IL-12 and IL-2 , we have focused on two subsets of peripheral blood T cells that differ dramatically in their intrinsic ability to respond to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .
This not only allows for the analysis of cytokine-activated signaling pathways and functional responses unperturbed by prior in vitro ma-nipulation , but also adds a component of physiologic relevance to the signaling pathways being studied , as the cytokine-induced activation of CD8 T cells may be critical to the host response to both infectious pathogens and tumors ( 37 , 39 ) .
Within both the JAK/STAT and MAP kinase family signaling pathways , we have demonstrated that IL-12 and IL-2 together synergistically increase the activation of signaling proteins in CD8 *CD18 '' '' ® '' * T cells in a manner that correlates with the augmentation of T cell proliferation , IFN-y production , and cytolytic activity .
Specifically , we have shown that T cell stimulation with IL-12 and IL-2 is required to maximally activate the stress-activated MAP kinases , p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/ JNK , whereas this same cytokine combination does not activate the ERKs .
In addition , we have shown that stimulation with IL-12 and IL-2 is required for optimal STAT1 and STAT3 serine phos- phorylation , but does not further augment STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation over the level observed in response to either cytokine alone .
Finally , through the use of a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase , we have found that the ability of IL-12 and IL-2 to augment functional responses and STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation in CD8 *CD18 '' ® '' * T cells is p38 MAP kinase dependent .
While ERK activation in response to IL-2 and IL-12 has been observed in murine cell lines and in mitogen-activated murine and human T cells , the CD8 `` CD18 '' ® '' * subset of peripheral blood T cells expressing IL-12 and IL-2 receptors did not display activation of ERK1 or ERK2 in response to stimulation with IL-12 and/or IL-2 .
This was not due to a defect in the ERK signaling pathway , as PMA was able to activate ERK2 in the same CD8 * T cells .
Although the ERKs may play a role in IL-12 and IL-2 responsiveness in T cell lines or in mitogen- or CD3-activated T cells , they do not appear to have a role in the TCR-independent activation of human peripheral blood CD8 *CD18 '' '' ® '' * T cells by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .
In contrast , the activation of the stress kinases by IL-12 and IL-2 correlated well with the functional synergy between these cytokines in CD18 '' ® '' * T cells .
Since the activation of both p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JINK was greatly augmented in CD18 '' ® '' * T cells with the addition of IL-12 and IL-2 , it is possible that both kinases play a role in the functional responsiveness to IL-12 and IL-2 .
However , the inhibition of proliferation , IFN-y production , and , to a lesser extent , non-MHC-restricted cytolytic activity in the presence of the p38 MAP 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology kinase inhibitor is strong evidence that p38 MAP kinase is necessary for the response of CD8 *CD18 '' '' ® '' * T cells to IL-12 and IL-2 .
The observation that p38 MAP kinase , but not SAPK/JNK or ERK1/ ERK2 , is highly expressed in CD18 '' ® '' * T cells and is weakly expressed in CD18 '' T cells ( two peripheral blood T cell subsets that are responsive and unresponsive , respectively , to the IL-12 and IL-2 combination ) lends further support to the hypothesis that p38 MAP kinase plays an important role in mediating the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 .
A recent study examining T cell proliferation in response to IL-2 also found that although p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK are both activated by IL-2 , proliferation could be inhibited with a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor ( 16 ) .
Nonetheless , it is still possible that p38 MAP kinase activation is necessary , but not suffi-cient , for mediating the functional effects of IL-12 and IL-2 , and SAPK/JNK activation may play an important role in conjunction with p38 MAP kinase .
A recent report demonstrated that p38 MAP kinase activation is required for mitogen-induced IFN-y production in CD4 * Th1 cells ( 45 ) .
In that study 1-10 uM SB203580 had a profound effect on Th1 cell IFN-y production in response to Con A without affecting IL-4 production by Th2 cells .
A dominant negative form of p38 MAP kinase had the same inhibitory effect on IFN-y production , whereas a dominant negative form of JNK had no effect .
Those findings support our observation that p38 MAP kinase , rather than SAPK/JNK , is a key regulator of cytokine-induced IFN-y production in CD8 `` CD18° '' ® '' * T cells .
As IL-12 plays a key role in Th1 cell development and , along with IL-2 , is a potent stimulator of IFN-y production by Th1 cells , it is probable that p38 MAP kinase activation is critical to both CD4 * and CD8 * T cell IL-12/IL-2 responsiveness .
As a parallel to our findings with CD18® '' ® '' * T cells , we have recently observed that IL-12 and IL-2 can also activate p38 MAP kinase in NK cells , a lymphocyte subset that bears a striking immunophenotypic and functional resemblance to CD8 T cells .
Furthermore , the functional response of NK cells to IL-12 and/or IL-2 is inhibited by $ B203580 ( J .
A. G. and D. A. F. , unpublished observations ) , suggesting that the responses of peripheral blood NK cells and CD8 *CD18 '' ® '' * T cells to Th1 type cytokines are p38 MAP kinase dependent .
Whereas STAT activation in response to IL-12 or IL-2 was not observed in CD18 '' T cells weakly expressing IL-12 and IL-2 receptors , the tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STATs was seen in CD18 '' '' ®** T cells in response to both cytokines .
However , the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 correlated not with STAT tyrosine phosphorylation but , rather , with STAT serine phosphorylation .
One explanation for this finding is that the small amount of STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by IL-12 or IL-2 alone in CD8 *CD18° '' *** T cells is insufficient to mediate gene activation in and of itself .
Only when STAT1 and STAT3 contain the additional phosphorylation of serine 727 , as occurs following treatment with IL-12 and IL-2 , can the necessary gene activation occur that results in the functional activation of T cells .
The importance of serine phosphorylation in the function of STATs has been demonstrated at the level of DNA binding and gene transcription .
While STAT tyrosine phosphorylation is critical for STAT dimerization , nuclear translocation , and DNA bind-ing , STAT3 serine phosphorylation is necessary for the binding of STAT3-STAT3 homodimers to DNA ( 28 ) .
Serine phosphorylation is also necessary for maximal transcriptional activation by tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 ( 27 ) .
A recent report ( 46 ) demonstrated that STAT transcriptional activation by IFN-y is dependent on the phosphorylation of serine 727 , and that this serine phosphorylation is required for the interaction of STAT1 a with MCMS , a member of the minichromosome maintenance ( MCM ) family involved in DNA replication .
4479 In addition to STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation , the serine phosphorylation of STATS may also be important in enhancing STATS5-mediated transcription in response to the combination of IL-2 and IL-12 .
Although we do not have Abs that specifically recognize the serine-phosphorylated form of STAT5 , it is known that the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATS in response to IL-2 is accompanied by serine phosphorylation ( 29 ) .
It is possible , therefore , that the increase in serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 seen after IL-12 and IL-2 treatment in CD8 ~CD18 '' ® '' * T cells may occur in STATS as well .
Despite the prominent STATS tyrosine phosphorylation relative to STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation seen in response to IL-2 alone in CD18 '' ® '' * T cells , an increase in serine phosphorylation in response to combined stimulation with IL-12 and IL-2 might still be capable of further augmenting STAT5-mediated transcriptional activation .
It is intriguing that STAT serine phosphorylation in response to IL-12 and IL-2 is completely abolished by an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase , for it raises the possibility that STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation in CD18 '' ® '' * T cells is either directly or indirectly mediated by p38 MAP kinase .
To our knowledge , this is the first evidence in lymphocytes that the JAK/STAT and MAP kinase family signaling pathways may interact at the level of STAT serine phosphorylation , and that this interaction may be necessary to maximize the functional response to Thl-type cytokines .
The fact that $ B203580 inhibits both STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation and the functional response to IL-12 and IL-2 without affecting STAT tyrosine phosphorylation further suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation may be necessary , but not suf-ficient , for STATs to mediate the functional effects of the IL-12/ IL-2 combination .
It should be noted , however , that if STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation is occurring via p38 MAP kinase , it is possible that this is not responsible for the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 .
Instead , the activation of other known substrates of p38 MAP kinase , such as ATF-2 , heat shock protein 27 , or MAP kinase activating protein kinase-2 ( 47 , 48 ) , may be contributing to that effect .
Furthermore , if p38 MAP kinase is responsible for STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation in response to IL-12 and IL-2 , it may not be responsible for cytokine-induced STATS serine phosphorylation , as STAT5a and STAT5b lack the -Pro-X-Ser-Pro- MAP kinase phosphorylation motif ( 49 ) shared by STAT1 and STAT3 ( 27 , 28 ) .
This MAP kinase phosphorylation motif is also shared by STAT4 , and as STAT4 is activated by IL-12 and is necessary for lymphocyte IL-12 responsiveness ( 24 ) , it will be important to determine whether STAT4 serine phosphorylation is also augmented through stimulation with IL-12 and IL-2 .
Interestingly , in the presence of S $ B203580 alone , there is an increase in the basal level of STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation in unstimulated CD18° '' ® '' * T cells .
It is noteworthy that in addition to its ability to inhibit the activity of phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase , SB203580 has been shown to increase the activity of MKK6 ( 44 ) .
While MKK6 is one of the major upstream activators of p38 MAP kinase , it does not activate SAPK/JNK .
In unstimulated CD8 `` CD18 '' '' ® '' * T cells , therefore , the heightened level of STAT serine phosphorylation induced by SB203580 may in part be due to the MKK6-induced activation of an unidentified serine/ threonine kinase distinct from p38 MAP kinase that is not inhibited by $ B203580 .
While we observed that SB203580-treated cells were unable to mediate STAT serine phosphorylation in response to IL-12 and IL-2 , we also found that stimulation with IL-12 and IL-2 in the absence of p38 MAP kinase activity abrogated the 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 4480 heightened basal levels of serine-phosphorylated STAT 's .
This suggests that concomitant signaling through both IL-12 and IL-2 receptors may activate a STAT serine phosphatase that normally serves to limit the duration of STAT serine phosphorylation following augmentation of the serine kinase activity of p38 MAP kinase by IL-12 and IL-2 .
When this putative serine phosphatase is activated by IL-12 and IL-2 in the presence of $ B203580 , the phosphatase activity may predominate in the absence of p38 MAP kinase activity , thereby favoring the loss of STAT serine phosphorylation .
The ability to correlate the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 with synergy observed at the level of signal transduction provides a basis for understanding which signaling pathways mediate select functional responses to these cytokines in lymphocytes .
Our findings suggest that T cell proliferation and IFN-y production induced by IL-12 and IL-2 are regulated through p38 MAP kinase activation , although SAPK/JNK activation may play a role as well .
Cytolytic activity induced by these cytokines , especially CD3-activated cytotoxicity , appeared to be less affected by inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity and may therefore be regulated by a different signaling pathway .
Although we have observed a strong association between p38 MAP kinase activation and STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation , additional studies will be required to prove that STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation are indeed mediated by p38 MAP kinase .
In addition , a detailed analysis of the effect of STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation on IL-12 and IL-2-induced gene transcription will be necessary to more cogently establish the role of STAT serine phosphorylation in the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 .
