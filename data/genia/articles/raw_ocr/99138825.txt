David G. Telander , Erika-Nell Malvey , and Daniel L. Mueller® The induction of clonal anergy in a T cell inhibits IL-2 secretion because of the development of a proximal signal transduction defect .
Fusion of anergic murine T cells to human Jurkat T leukemia cells and formation of heterokaryons failed to result in a complementation of this signaling defect and restoration of murine IL-2 mRNA inducibility .
Instead , signal transduction to the human ZL-2 gene became disrupted .
Heterokaryons formed by the fusion of anergic murine T cells to normal murine T cells also failed to accumulate intracellular IL-2 protein in response to stimulation either with the combination of CD3 and CD28 mAbs or with ionomycin plus a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester .
The results argue against a loss-of-function signaling defect as the sole basis for clonal anergy induction and document the presence of a dominant-acting repressor molecule that inhibits signal transduction to the IL-2 gene within viable anergic T cells .
enkins and Schwartz ( 1 , 2 ) first described the development of a functional unresponsiveness ( now termed clonal anergy ) in murine CD4 * Th cell clones exposed to a peptide Ag in the absence of costimulatory signals ( 3 ) .
The capacity of these affected T cells to proliferate in response to subsequent exposure to the same Ag was significantly impaired as a result of an inability to secrete IL-2 .
This has suggested that a novel control mechanism exists to regulate the clonal expansion of self- Ag-specific T cells in the peripheral immune system in an effort to maintain or restore immune self tolerance ( 4 ) .
While the biochemical basis for this IL-2 production defect remains uncertain , we and others have observed a defect in the coupling of the TCR to downstream p21 '' and mitogen-activated protein kinases ( 5 , 6 ) .
This defect is thought to be responsible for an inability of anergic cells to induce activating protein-1 complex assembly and function at the 5 ' IL-2 gene enhancer to initiate transcription ( 7-9 ) .
Such a proximal block in signal transduction to the IL-2 gene could be due to the inactivation or degradation of important signaling molecules in the plasma membrane or cytosol of unresponsive T cells .
Alternatively , clonal anergy may result from the induction ( or overexpression ) of molecules capable of inhibiting the transmission of signals from the Ag receptor to the nucleus .
To test the first hypothesis , we determined whether fusion of anergic murine Th cells to normal murine or human T cells otherwise capable of secreting IL-2 would be sufficient to result in a complementation of the anergy defect and the restoration of normal IL-2 gene inducibility .

( PEG ) both by using a strategy of species-specific mAbs and RT-PCR to stimulate and detect mRNA for murine IL-2 and by detecting the accumulation of intracellular IL-2 protein in heterokaryons using flow cytometry .
Our results indicate that a molecular repressor molecule present within anergic T cells can block the transduction of biochemical signals from the plasma membrane to the IL-2 gene even after cell fusion and heterokaryon formation .
Materials and Methods T cells Cloned murine CD4* Th cells ( A.E7 and 16B.2 ) ( 10 , 11 ) were used as fusion partners with the human T leukemia cell line Jurkat ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) .
A murine CD4* T cell line produced by intermittent in vitro Ag stimulation ( three or four cycles ) of lymph node cells from the DO11.10 TCR-transgenic mice was also used in the murine/ murine heterokaryon experiments ( 12 ) .
T cells in this line uniformly express a TCR that can be recognized by the KJ1-26 anti-clonotypic mAb ( 13 ) .
T cells were grown at 37°C with 5 % CO , in complete medium consisting of a 1/1 mixture of Eagle 's Hanks ' amino acids medium ( Biofluids , Rockville , MD ) and RPMI 1640 ( Celox , Hopkins , MN ) containing 10 % FCS ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , penicillin , gentamicin , and 5 X 10~ '' M 2-ME .
Murine cells were periodically stimulated with irradiated syngeneic splenocytes and Ag and were split 2 days later with 50 U/ml of IL-2 .
Then they were allowed at least 12 days to return to a resting phenotype before purification on Ficoll-Hypaque ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) and use in experiments .
Clonal anergy induction Anergy was induced in T cells by incubation overnight at 37°C in flasks coated with 0.5-2 ug/ml of immobilized anti-CD3 mAb in the absence of accessory cells as previously described ( 8 ) .
Thereafter , the cells were removed from the mAb , resuspended in complete medium , and rested for 4-9 days .
Before restimulation , viable cells were recovered on a Ficoll-Hypague density gradient and then stimulated as indicated in the experiment .
Heterokaryon formation Murine and human T cells were mixed at a ratio of 1.5/1 and suspended in 42 % PEG ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) in PBS for 2 min at room temperature , then gently pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min ( 14 ) .
PEG 1000 proved to be the most effective for fusion of these cells .
PEG was immediately washed away using serum-free RPMI , and viable cells were recovered on a Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation gradient .

T cell activation T cells were then cultivated for 5-7 h in complete medium either without stimulation or in the presence of CD3 plus CD28 mAbs as previously described ( 8 ) .
For stimulation of Jurkat cells and the murine/human heterokaryons , purified anti-human CD3 mAb OKT3 ( American Type Culture Collection ) or 64.1 ( a gift from Dr. Peter Lipsky , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX ) was immobilized on the culture plate at a concentration of 1-10 pg/ml for 90 min before cultivation of the T cells .
The anti-human CD28 mAb 9.3 was in ascites ( provided by Dr. Jeff Ledbetter , Oncogen , Seattle , WA ) and was added directly to the cultures at a 1/1000 dilution .
For stimulation of the murine T cells and all heterokaryons , purified anti-murine CD3 mAb 145-2C11 ( 15 ) and anti-murine CD28 mAb 37.51 ( 3 ) were coimmobilized at concentrations of 1.0 and 0.3 pg/ml , respectively , except where noted .
Alternatively , T cells were activated with the combination of 0.5 uM ionomycin ( Iono ; Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) and 10 ng/ml PMA ( Calbiochem ) to bypass stimulation of the TCR .
RT-PCR Following stimulation with one or the other mAb pairs , cultures were extracted with RNA-STAT 60 ( Tel-Test , Friendswood , TX ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendation to recover total cellular RNA .
Samples were DNase treated , and 5 pug of RNA was then reverse transcribed using random hexanucleotides ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) and avian myeloblastosis virus ( AMV ) reverse transcriptase ( Promega , Madi-son , WI ) to produce cDNA .
Dilutions of cDNAs were then performed to allow for a semiquantitative estimate of the original murine mRNA steady state levels using the PCR and species-specific PCR primers .

To enhance primer specificity , annealing temperatures for the initial cycles of the PCR were decreased from 62 to 58°C ; then 29 more cycles were conducted with an annealing temperature of 57°C .
PCR products were separated by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized either by ethidium bromide staining within the gel or by Southern blotting to nylon membrane ( Magnagraph Micron Separation , Westborough , MA ) with detection using human IL-2 , murine IL-2 , and murine lymphotactin gene cDNA probes .
The primers amplified DNAs of the following sizes : murine IL-2 , 467 bp ; murine lymphotactin , 444 bp ; murine HPRT , 432 bp ; human IL-2 , 344 bp ; and human HPRT , 234 bp .
Confocal laser microscopy The confocal microscopy analysis used PEG-treated cultures incubated for 5 h in complete medium .
Viable cells were then attached to coverslips precoated with 1 mg/ml Con A ( Pharmacia ) by centrifugation .
Cells were incubated with anti-human CD45-biotin ( PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) for 20 min , washed in sorter buffer , and then incubated for 20 min more with anti-murine CD4-FITC ( Caltag , South San Francisco , CA ) and streptavi-din-Cy5 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) .
Washed cells were fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then permeabilized with 1 % Triton X-100 ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) for 2 min .
Washed cells were exposed to 1 mg/ml RNase A for 10 min at 37°C followed by air-drying .
In the final incubation step , ethidium bromide was added at a concentration of 1 pg/ml for 5 min followed by washing of the cells .
Coverslips were mounted to slides , and images were collected on a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal laser microscope using COMOS version 6.05.8 software ( Bio-Rad Microscience , Herts , U.K. ) .
Grey scale images were electronically collected using 488 nm ( murine CD4 ) , 568 nm ( ethidium bromide ) , and 647 nm ( human CD45 ) fluorescence laser exci-tation ; a X60 objective ; and a Kalman filter ( 16 scans ) .
Images were then imported into Adobe Photoshop software ( Adobe Systems , San Jose , CA ) , pseudo-colored ( murine CD4 fluorescence emission as green , human CD45 as red , and ethidium as blue ) , and merged .
Flow cytometry For the murine/human heterokaryons , PEG-treated cultures were incubated on ice for 30 min with a mixture of anti-human CD45-CyChrome ( PharMingen ) and anti-murine CD4-PE ( PharMingen ) in sorter buffer containing RT-PCR analysis of murine IL-2 , lymphotactin , and HPRT gene expression as well as human IL-2 in unfused or fused mixtures of murine and human T cells .
A , 16B.2 murine T cells and Jurkat human T cells were mixed either without ( unfused ) or with ( fused ) exposure to PEG , were recovered and washed , and then were incubated for 6 h with no stimulus ( nil ) , anti-murine CD3 plus CD28 mAbs ( mu ) , or anti-human CD3 plus CD28 mAbs ( hu ) .

Cell fusion was then analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan cytometer and CellQuest software ( Bec-ton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) .
In the case of murine/murine heterokaryons , A.E7 or 16B.2 T cells were stained with the fluorescence tracking dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate/succinimidyl ester ( CFSE ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) at a 0.5-nM concentration before fusion .
PEG-treated cultures were then stimulated in plates for 2 h with either the combination of CD3 plus CD28 mAbs or with Iono plus PMA .
At that time , 10 pg/ml brefeldin A ( Sigma ) was added to the cultures , and incubation was continued for an additional 5 h. Cultures were harvested and stained with KJ1-26-biotin/streptavidin-CyChrome ( PharMingen ) followed by fixation with 4 % formaldehyde and detection of intracellular IL-2 with anti-IL-2-PE ( PharMingen ) as previously described ( 16 ) .
CFSE* KJ1-26* heterokaryons were electronically gated , and IL-2 accumulation was compared with that of normal KJ1-26* T cells .
Results and Discussion Functional murine/human heterokaryons can be detected following fusion of normal murine cloned T cells and Jurkat human cells in the presence of PEG The mRNA harvested from unfused mixtures of murine cloned CD4 * Th cells and human Jurkat cells contained detectable transcripts for murine IL-2 only when the cells were stimulated with an mAb pair specific for murine CD3 and CD28 molecules ( Fig .
14 , lane 2 ) .
Anti-CD3 and -CD28 mAbs reactive with human mole-cules , while capable of inducing the production of human IL-2 mRNA by the Jurkat cells within the mixed population ( Fig .
14 , lane 3 ) , did not stimulate murine IL-2 mRNA detectable by RT-PCR , confirming the species specificity of both the anti-human Abs and the PCR primers .
In contrast , exposure of mixed cell populations ( murine Th cells plus Jurkat ) to PEG resulted in the appearance of mRNA for murine IL-2 that could be easily detected after stimulation of the cells with Abs against human CD3 and CD28 ( Fig .
1A , lane 5 ) .
This result showed that functional murine/ human heterokaryons do form in the presence of PEG .
In each of seven experiments using a semiquantitative RT-PCR detection method , murine IL-2 mRNA was produced in response to anti-human mAbs only after exposure to PEG , and the amount of mRNA observed was 9 + 4 % that seen following anti-mouse CD3 plus CD28 stimulation .
This production of murine IL-2 mRNA in response to anti-human reagents , while relatively small , was consistent with the modest frequency ( 2.6 + 0.4 % ; n = 9 ) of heterokaryon formation that was observed using FACS to identify cells that simultaneously expressed both murine and human surface markers ( Fig .
2B ) .
Double-labeled murine/human heterokaryons were similarly detected in PEG-fused populations using confocal microscopy , and they consistently ( in each of 22 murine/human heterokaryons analyzed ) demonstrated the presence of at least one denser murine T cell nucleus plus one larger human Jurkat-derived nucleus ( Fig .
1B ) .
Finally , the activation of a B-galactosidase reporter gene ( regulated by a multimer of the DNA binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells ) stably transfected into Jurkat could be detected by three-color flow cytometry following stimulation with anti-murine CD3 and CD28 only after fusion with the mouse cloned T cells ( data not shown ) .
Using RT-PCR , the induction of a second murine gene called lymphotactin ( 8 , 17 ) was also examined in these heterokaryons , and its transcription was similarly induced by anti-human CD3 and CD28 mAbs only in PEG-fused populations ( Fig .
1 , lanes 3 and 5 ) .
Therefore , sufficient similarities must exist between the signaling cascades of man and mouse such that stimulation of human CD3 and CD28 molecules can fully activate murine gene transcription in the murine/human heterokaryons .
We then took advantage of these similarities to test whether signaling molecules provided by human Jurkat cells could restore normal signal transduction to the murine IL-2 gene after fusion with an anergic murine Th cell .

- Fusion of Jurkat T cells with anergic CD4* Th cells fails to restore murine IL-2 gene inducibility .
Normal ( N ) or anergic ( A ) A.E7 murine Th cells were mixed with Jurkat human T cells and exposed to PEG to allow the formation of heterokaryons .
A , Cell mixtures were analyzed for expression of the indicated ( murine IL-2 and lymphofactin ) murine mRNA by RT-PCR following 6 h of incubation either in the absence of Abs ( nil ) or in the presence of anti-murine or anti-human CD3 plus CD28 mAbs , as indicated .
The cDNA templates were diluted as indicated before PCR and detection by Southern blotting .
Murine HPRT expression was also determined for each sample , and this showed equivalent mRNA recovery and integrity ( data not shown ) .
B , Surface expression of human CD45 and mouse CD4 molecules determined by flow cytometry .
Each experiment shown ( A and B ) is representative of at least two additional experiments with similar results .
Fusion of anergic murine T cells with Jurkat fails to overcome the anergy defect Clonal anergy was induced in cloned murine T cells by overnight exposure to immobilized CD3 mAb to mimic Ag recognition in the absence of CD28 costimulation , as previously described ( 8 ) .
The T cells were then allowed to incubate in medium alone for 6 days , in parallel with a normal control T cell population that had not been exposed to the CD3 mAb .
Upon rechallenge with Ag , the CD3-pretreated T cells showed a substantially reduced IL-2 production and proliferation compared with the control population ( data not shown ) , consistent with the induction of clonal anergy .
Each group of murine cloned T cells was then mixed with Jurkat , fused in PEG , and subsequently examined for mRNA synthesis following stimulation with the CD3 and CD28 mAb pairs ( Fig .
24 ) .
Anergic T cells expressed significantly fewer murine IL-2 mRNA transcripts than control cells upon stimulation with the anti-murine CD3 and CD28 mAbs ( Fig .
24 , compare lanes 3-7 to lanes 8-11 ) .
This was the expected result , since heterokaryon formation occurred only at low frequency , and no effect of the Jurkat cells was anticipated on the majority of the nonfused murine T cells in the culture .
Murine Iymphotactin mRNA , on the other hand , was strongly induced in the anergic group by the anti-murine mAb stimulation as previously reported ( 8 ) , again indicating that some signaling pathways between the plasma membrane and the nucleus remained intact within the anergic murine Th cells .

Repression of human IL-2 mRNA expression following fusion of Jurkat human T cells with anergic murine cells .
Normal or anergic A.E7 murine T cells were mixed with Jurkat cells and exposed to PEG .
Fused cultures were then incubated for 6 h either without stimulation or with one of the anti-murine or anti-human CD3 plus CD28 mAb pairs , followed by extraction of mRNA and RT .
cDNA templates were diluted as shown and then amplified with human IL-2-specific primers with PCR products detected by Southern blotting or were amplified with hHPRT primers and detected by ethidium bromide staining as indicated ( R ) .
Upon stimulation of the PEG-fused anergic group with anti-human CD3 and CD28 mAbs to focus attention solely on the murine/human heterokaryons in the culture , the defect in murine IL-2 mRNA induction persisted ( Fig .
24 , compare lanes 12 and 13 with lanes 14 and 15 ) .
A correction of the clonal anergy IL-2 mRNA synthesis defect was never observed in five separate fusion experiments , and murine IL-2 mRNA inducibility within these anergic heterokaryons remained reduced by an average of 80 + 5 % .
This failure of the anergic group to synthesize murine IL-2 mRNA in response to the anti-human mAb pair was not simply the result of a decreased capacity of anergic murine cells to form a viable heterokaryon with Jurkat , since murine lymphotactin mRNA could still be normally induced with the combination of anti-human mAbs ( Fig .
24 ) .
Furthermore , anergic T cells were observed to 1463 form heterokaryons with Jurkat with a frequency similar to that in normal cells ( Fig .
2B ) .
Therefore , a defect in signal transduction to the murine IL-2 gene that exists in anergic T cells could not be overcome by fusion and mixing of anergic cell contents with Jurkat .
A dominant-acting repressor molecule in viable anergic T cells Human IL-2 gene inducibility was also examined following fusion of Jurkat to the anergic mouse T cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
Anergic murine/ human heterokaryons demonstrated defective human IL-2 gene transcription following CD3 and CD28 stimulation with the anti-mouse mAb pair compared with normal heterokaryons .
In five separate experiments , human IL-2 gene inducibility was reduced 78 + 9 % following fusion with anergic T cells .
Thus , a molecule within the anergic murine T cell was capable of interrupting the normal cascade of signals from the plasma membrane to the human IL-2 gene when introduced into Jurkat T cells .
These findings rule out the simple hypothesis that an inactivation or degradation of one proximal signal transduction component accounts for the inability of anergic T cells to activate the IL-2 gene ( Fig .
44 ) .
Even if the human counterpart of such a putative defective component failed to act in its place because of a species difference ( which is unlikely given the conservation between man and mouse of the signaling cascades ) , one should have expected multiple cross-species interactions within the signaling cascade of the heterokaryon distal to the murine signaling block .
Instead , the data suggest that the induction of clonal anergy in CD4 * Th cells results in the expression of a dominant-acting repressor molecule capable of inhibiting a signal transduction cascade involving normal components from both species ( Fig .
4B ) .
We independently tested this final hypothesis using a flow cy-tometric approach to examine the inducibility of intracellular IL-2 protein accumulation after the fusion of one anergic murine T cell to another normal murine cell .
KJ1-26 * T cells cultivated in vitro by intermittent Ag stimulation are normally heavy IL-2 producers and demonstrate significant intracellular IL-2 accumulation in response to activation in the presence of brefeldin A ( Figs .
5 and 6 ) .
Nevertheless , fusion of normal KJ1-26 '' T cells with anergic CFSE-stained A.E7 or 16B.2 T cells yielded a population of CFSE* KJ1-26+* heterokaryons that was deficient in the production of IL-2 relative to either normal heterokaryons or unfused T cell Anergic Murine Murine/Human Heterokaryon Jurkat Human T cell FIGURE 4 .
Models of T cell clonal anergy .
Results obtained here argue against a model ( 4 ) in which the loss of a signaling component in anergic cells ( illustrated by the lack of a red Y molecule ) interrupts signal transduction to the murine IL-2 gene , as heterokaryon formation failed to overcome the clonal anergy defect by the provision of normal signaling molecules of human origin ( denoted by the blue letters marked with an asterisk ) .
Instead , the data are most consistent with a model ( B ) in which signals can not be transduced in anergic murine/human heterokaryons by either murine ( red letters ) or human ( blue letters with the asterisk ) signaling components because of the presence of a dominant-acting repressor molecule ( indicated by the violet shaded starburst ) .

Intracellular IL-2 accumulation is inhibited following the fusion of anergic cloned murine T cells to normal DO11.10 murine CD4 * T cells .
Normal and anergic groups of cloned murine T cells ( either A.E7 or 16B.2 ) were first treated with CFSE and then mixed with normal DO11.10 CD4* T cells in the presence of PEG .
Following cell fusion , cultures were stimulated for 7 h , with the addition of brefeldin A during the final 5 h of the cultivation period .
Cultures were then harvested , and murine/murine heterokaryons were identified by flow cytometry using the fluorescence of CFSE in FL1 together with the detection of the DO11.10 Ag receptor with KJ1-26-biotin and streptavidin-CyChrome in FL3 .
Double-positive heterokaryons and single-positive unfused KJ1-26 * T cells were then gated electronically ( RZ and R2 , respectively ) , and IL-2 accumulation was determined in each subpopulation in response to stimuli as indicated in the panels .

In contrast to heterokaryons , IL-2 synthesis by the majority of KJ1-26 `` T cells that remained unfused in the PEG-treated cultures was not significantly reduced by the presence of anergic CD4 * T cells .
These observations of a dominant-acting repressor molecule in anergic T cells are consistent with previous speculation regarding the accumulation of a putative `` unresponsiveness gene '' product capable of blocking activation of the IL-2 gene ( 18 , 19 ) .
Previously , it was reported that the Src family protein tyrosine kinase p59Fyn is overexpressed and hyperactive in anergic Th cells ( 20- MOLECULAR REPRESSOR IN ANERGIC T HETEROKARYONS 22 ) .
Such high constitutive kinase activity could , perhaps , desensitize the coupling of CD3 molecules to pathways downstream of p21 '' '' in anergic T cells even after heterokaryon formation as a result of increased tyrosine phosphorylation and functional sequestration of the adapter protein Cbl ( 23 ) .
Likewise , the constitutively active Rap1l GTP-binding protein that has been observed in anergic cells might also be expected to act as a repressor molecule as a result of its ability to physically sequester Raf-1 kinase in an inactive state , as suggested by Boussiotis and colleagues ( 23 ) .
Overexpression or -activation of protein tyrosine phosphatases such as Shp or Syp might also be expected to inhibit signaling downstream to p21 '' '' by antagonizing the activation of the tyrosine kinase Zap70 or promoting the activities of the CTLA4-negative regulatory molecule , respectively ( 24 , 25 ) .
However , no information regarding the behavior of such phosphatases in anergic T cells has yet been reported .
Data shown here now document the actions of a repressor molecule in the regulation of endogenous IL-2 gene expression .
It should be noted that in these experiments the actions of such a repressor molecule would dominate over the complementation of a missing signaling component , should both have occurred in heterokaryons of anergic T cells .
It is possible that both a repressive mechanism and the loss of a signaling component coexist in anergic T cells .
Similarly , the observation of a dominant-acting repression does not allow for a determination of the location of the repressor molecule ( s ) within anergic T cells .
Previous biochemical analyses of anergic murine Th cells have indicated a block in signal transduction to p21 '' '' and the mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) ( 5 , 6 ) , resulting in poor induction of Fos and Jun species important to frans-activation at the 5 ' IL-2 gene enhancer ( 7 , 8 ) .
Therefore , these new results could support a model in which a proximal inhibitor molecule blocks the coupling of the Ag receptor to p21 '' .
Nevertheless , these data may also have resulted from the effects of a nuclear repressor molecule capable of trans-locating to the heterokaryon 's normal nucleus during the course of the experiment .
The zinc finger DNA binding protein called negative regulator of IL-2a ( Nil-2a ) has the capacity to inhibit transactivation at the IL-2 gene ( 26 ) , and overexpression of this repressor molecule has previously been suggested as the basis for clonal anergy in human T cell clones ( 27 ) .
A pair of activating protein-1-like DNA sequences within the 5 ' ZL-2 gene enhancer have also been suggested as the targets of dominant negative regulation in the nucleus of anergic murine T cells ( 28 ) .
Iono plus PMA activation can not bypass the effects of the anergy repressor molecule Previously , we reported that the stimulation of anergic T cells with the combination of a calcium ionophore and protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester resulted in a significant , albeit incomplete , restoration of their proliferative capacity ( 5 ) .
Furthermore , we had demonstrated an ability of PMA to bypass the defect in anergic cells that otherwise resulted in an inability to activate MAPK .
Therefore , it was of interest to determine whether the repressor molecule acting in anergic murine/murine heterokaryons had any capacity to interfere with IL-2 protein accumulation in response to treatment with Iono/PMA .
If true , this would indicate that the repressor molecule acts downstream of the MAPK or in a separate signaling pathway parallel to the MAPK cascade .
IL-2 production in anergic murine/murine heterokaryons was , in fact , observed to be defective following incubation in the presence of Iono and PMA ( Fig .
5C ) .
Anergic murine/murine heterokaryons activated with Iono/PMA again demonstrated a 48 + 5 % reduction in IL-2 production relative to that by control heterokaryons .

- Tono and PMA stimulation of anergic DO11.10 T cells only partially overcomes the defect in intracellular IL-2 accumulation .
Normal control ( A and C ) and anergic ( B and D ) DO11.10 T cells were stimulated for 7 h either with the combination of CD3 and CD28 mAbs ( immobilized at 0.5 and 10 ug/ml , respectively ; A and B ) or with Iono plus PMA ( C and D ) , with brefeldin A added during the final 5 h of culture .
The accumulation of intracellular IL-2 protein was detected in T cells by flow cytometry using anti-IL-2-PE ( dark tracing ) and compared with staining with a phy-coerythrin-conjugated isotype-matched Ab as a control ( light tracing ) .
Values above the markers indicate the mean percentage of IL-2-positive cells within the indicated region + SEM for replicate samples .
Unstimulated T cells were , on the average , 3.0 + 0.3 % IL-2 positive ( not shown ) .
Similar results were observed with the 16B.2 T cell clone .
The finding that anergic heterokaryons remain defective for IL-2 synthesis even after stimulation with the combination of a calcium ionophore and protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester suggests that clonal anergy does not act solely to interfere with signals upstream of ERK and JNK .
Consistent with this , we observed that intracellular IL-2 accumulation by anergic DO11.10 T cells was only partially restored during stimulation with Iono/PMA ( 38 % of the normal control T cell response vs a response that was 7 % of the control following stimulation with CD3/CD28 mAbs ; Fig .
6 ) .
Taken together , these results now suggest a model in which clonal anergy induction both interferes with the upstream activation of p21 '' and the MAPK and represses the activation of the IL-2 gene at a point either downstream of or parallel to the MAPK .
Thus , a biochemical examination of signal transduction events in anergic heterokaryons will be necessary to determine whether this negative regulator is also acting to block signal transduction upstream of p21 '' '' or whether complementation of a proximal defect did , in fact , occur in the setting of a coexisting molecular repressor .
