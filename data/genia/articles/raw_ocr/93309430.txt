7 Cell Cycle Analysis of E2F in Primary Human T Cells Reveals Novel E2F Complexes and Biochemically Distinct Forms of Free E2F THOMAS CHITTENDEN , DAVID M. LIVINGSTON , * anp JAMES A. DeCAPRIO Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School , 44 Binney Street , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Received 6 January 1993/Returned for modification 9 February 1993/Accepted 16 April 1993 The transcription factor E2F activates the expression of multiple genes involved in cell proliferation , such as c-myc and the dihydrofolate reductase gene .
Regulation of E2F involves its interactions with other cellular proteins , including the retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) , the Rb-related protein p107 , cyclin A , and cdk2 .
We undertook a detailed analysis of E2F DNA-binding activities and their cell cycle behavior in primary human T cells .
Three E2F DNA-binding activities were identified in resting ( G , ) T cells with mobilities in gel shift assays distinct from those of previously defined E2F complexes .
One of these activities was found to be a novel , less abundant , Rb-E2F complex .
The most prominent E2F activity in resting T cells ( termed complex X ) was abundant in both G , and G , but disappeared as cells entered S phase , suggesting a possible role in negatively regulating E2F function .
Complex X could be dissociated by adenovirus E1A with a requirement for an intact E1A conserved region 2 .
However , X failed to react with a variety of antibodies against Rb or p107 , implicating the involvement of an E1A-binding protein other than Rb or p107 .
In addition to these novel E2F complexes , three distinct forms of unbound ( free ) E2F were resolved in gel shift experiments .
These species showed different cell cycle kinetics .
UV cross-linking experiments suggested that a distinct E2F DNA-binding protein is uniquely associated with the S-phase p107 complex and is not associated with Rb .
Together , these results suggest that E2F consists of multiple , biochemically distinct DNA-binding proteins which function at different points in the cell cycle .
The transcription factor E2F was originally identified as an element needed for the activation of a specific adenoviral early promoter ( pE2A ) ( 20 , 21 , 44 ) .
ELA stimulation of the viral E2 transcription unit requires the interaction of E2F with the sequence TTTCGCG , represented twice within the E2 promoter ( 23 , 43 ) .
A second viral protein , the 19-kDa E4 protein , interacts with E2F and promotes the formation of a stable DNA-binding complex on the E2 promoter binding sites ( 17 , 25 , 29 , 36 ) .
While adenovirus recruits E2F during infection to activate viral promoters , one normal cellular function of E2F is to contribute to the transcriptional regulation of multiple growth-responsive cellular genes , many of which contribute to DNA synthesis .
E2F binding sites have been identified in the promoters of the c-myc , c-myb , N-myc , dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) , thymidine kinase , DNA polymerase a , and cdc2 genes ( 4 , 9 , 14 , 16 , 28 , 30 , 33 , 39 ) .
The E2F binding site in the P2 promoter of c-myc is required for activation of myc following serum stimulation ( 28 ) ; in the case of the DHFR gene , the E2F site is important for increased expression at the G , /S boundary ( 26 ) .
These observations suggest that E2F plays an important role in imparting appropriate cell cycle regulated transcription to genes that govern cell growth .
Regulation of E2F involves interactions with multiple cellular proteins ( reviewed in reference 30 ) .
The retinoblastoma susceptibility protein ( Rb ) , which has served as a paradigm for a tumor suppressor , forms a specific complex with E2F ( 2 , 3 , 6 , 8 ) .
Loss of Rb function , by deletion or mutation , occurs in all retinoblastomas and is a frequent * Corresponding author .
3975 event in certain other human tumors as well ( 24 ) .
Rb-E2F binding may be an important component of the mechanism whereby Rb negatively regulates cell growth , since loss-of-function mutant species of Rb isolated from human tumors can no longer interact with E2F ( 15 , 34 ) .
Moreover , the ability of Rb to suppress cell growth in some assays appears to correlate with its capacity to bind E2F ( 34 ) .
There is mounting evidence that Rb-EZ2F complexes may negatively regulate E2F function , perhaps by sequestering E2F or by functioning as a repressor of E2F-responsive promoters ( 2 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 41 , 45 ) .
The biological activity of adenovirus ElA is consistent with this possibility .
ElA dissociates Rb-E2F complexes , releasing unbound or free E2F , which is then able to interact with adenovirus E4 protein and transactivate the E2 promoter ( 1 ) .
ElA sequences necessary for dissociation of Rb-E2F complexes reside within conserved region 2 .
These sequences are also required for direct binding to Rb and for E1lA-mediated cell transformation ( 35 ) .
The capacity to disrupt Rb-E2F complexes is shared by two additional viral transforming proteins which interact with Rb , the simian virus 40 large T antigen and the human papillomavirus E7 protein ( 7 , 32 ) , indicating that E2F is a common cellular target of DNA tumor viruses .
The Rb-related protein p107 forms an independent complex with EZ2F ( 5 , 10 , 38 ) .
The predominant p107-E2F complex identified in cell extracts also contains cyclin A and an associated kinase , cdk2 ( 5 , 10 , 31 ) .
Adenovirus ElA also binds p107 , with a requirement in both cases for ElA conserved region 2 sequences ( 42 ) , and it can also dissociate pl07-E2F complexes ( 7 , 38 ) .
A less abundant pl07-E2F complex , containing cyclin E and cdk2 , has also been described ( 22 ) .
While it is not yet known how these interac- 3976 CHITTENDEN tions affect E2F function , the association of E2F with components of the cell cycle machinery likely reflects a mechanism linking E2F activity with its suspected role in cell cycle control .
Analysis of E2F complexes in the cell cycle has shown that the Rb-EZF and p107-E2F complexes are differentially regulated .
The p107-cyclin A-E2F complex is absent in G , and is detected at the onset of S phase ( 38 ) , whereas the pl07-cyclin E-E2F complex largely appears in late G , ( 22 ) .
The Rb-E2F complex is present in G , and in S ( 38 ) .
There-fore , E2F does not appear to be simply handed off from Rb to p107 as a cell progresses from late G , into S. To better understand the regulation of E2F , it is important to learn which species of E2F are present at certain key points in the cell cycle .
In an effort to address this question , we have attempted to identify and characterize E2F species in primary , diploid human cells with respect to their composition and temporal abundance .
In this study , we have undertaken a more detailed analysis of both predominant and less abundant E2F DNA-binding activities in primary human T lymphocytes from healthy donors .
We chose to perform these studies with primary human cells since , unlike most established cell lines , these cells are diploid and should produce wild-type E2F and E2F-binding partners .
Our analysis has identified several novel EZF complexes , one of which is restricted to Gy/G , and appears to involve an interaction with a heretofore unrecognized E2F-binding protein .
In addition , both gel shift and UV cross-linking experiments suggested the existence of biochemically distinct E2F DNA-binding species , at least one of which interacts with p107 but not with Rb .
These results point to additional levels of complexity in the regulation of and by E2F in the cell cycle .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of human T lymphocytes and cell extracts .
Primary human T lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood by centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque gradients ( Pharmacia ) .
Adherent cells were depleted from these preparations by incubation on plastic dishes for at least 2 h. Cells were harvested immediately thereafter for preparation of whole cell extracts .
In some cases , cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 ( GIBCO ) with 10 % fetal calf serum ( GIBCO ) at 37°C in a 5 % CO , -containing atmosphere .
They were stimulated by the addition of phytohemagglutinin ( 1 mg/m ! )
for the indicated times prior to being extracted .
Centrifugal elutriation of T cells was performed as described previously ( 38 ) .
U937 cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal calf serum .
Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously ( 27 , 38 ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) .
DNA binding assays were performed as described previously ( 38 ) , with some modifications .
DNA binding reaction mixtures contained 20 pl of binding buffer ( 50 mM KCI , 20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ; pH 7.6 ] , 10 mM MgCl , , 10 % glycerol , 0.5 mM dithiothreitol , 0.1 % Nonidet P-40 ) , 2 ug of sonicated salmon sperm DNA , 5 to 10 mg of whole cell extract , and 1 ng of **P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe ( E2pro ; see below } .
Approximately 50 ng of the relevant purified , Escherichia coli-synthesized glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -E1A and/or GST-E4 fusion protein ( 19 , 29 , 38 ) was added to reactions where indicated .
In some experiments , 1 pl ( 0.5 ug ) of purified monoclonal antibody ( XZ55 or C36 ; Pharmingen ) or 1 wl of rabbit polyclonal antisera ( anti-p107 , N9 , and preimmune ; [ 38 ] ) Mor .

was added to DNA binding reactions .
Affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum to E2F-1 ( 19 ) was provided by W. Krek .
Where indicated , 2 wl of monoclonal antibody tissue culture supernatant SD4 , $ D6 , SD15 , XZ140 , HE111 , or 423 was added .
The p107 monoclonal antibodies SD4 , SD6 , and SD15 were generously provided by N. Dyson and E. Harlow ( 10b ) ; XZ140 and HE111 were the kind gifts of E. Harlow and E. Lees , respectively .
Binding reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then analyzed by electrophoresis at 300 V and 4°C in 4 % polyacrylamide , 0.25 % Tris-borate-EDTA gels .
Oligonucleotides .
The DNA sequences of the E2F DNA binding site oligonucleotides E2pro , DHFR WT , and DHFR MUT were described previously ( 38 ) , as were C9 and BK ( 8 ) .
E2pro , used as a probe in E2F DNA binding assays , contains the -70 to -32 region of the adenoviral E2 promoter , encompassing both E2F binding sites .
The sequence of the E2BDR oligonucleotide used for UV cross-linking experiments ( see below ) is UV cross-linking experiments .
UV cross-linking of E2F complexes was carried out as described by Thompson et al .
( 40 ) .
A bromodeoxyuridine ( BUdR ) -substituted probe was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotide primer E2BDR with the plus strand of E2pro .
One microgram of the annealed oligonucleotides was incubated with DNA polymerase I ( Klenow fragment ) in the presence of 0.1 mM each dATP , dGTP , and bromo-dUTP ( Sigma ) , 5 wM dCTP , and 200 wCi of [ « - '' °P ] dCTP ( 3,000 Ci/mmol ) .
Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatogra-phy .
EMSAs were performed with the BUdR-substituted probe ( 10° cpm per binding reaction ) as described above except that the amount of cell extract was increased twofold .
Immediately after electrophoresis , the wet gel was covered with plastic wrap and exposed to UV light ( 500 mJ ) with a Stratalinker 1800 ( Stratagene ) .
The positions of various EZ2F complexes were determined by overnight autoradiography at 4°C .
Gel slices containing various E2F bands were excised and crushed with 50 pl of 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer between two glass slides .
The gel slurries were then boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed through an SDS-8 % polyacrylamide gel along with prestained molecular weight markers ( Sigma ) .
RESULTS Identification of additional E2F DNA-binding activities in unstimulated T-cell extracts .
Previous experiments using EMSA led to the identification of four specific E2F activities in mitogen-stimulated T cells ( 38 ) ( Fig .
1 , stimulated ) .
They have been designated complexes C , B , A , and A ' .
It was previously demonstrated that B contains E2F bound to Rb ( 38 ) .
The most slowly migrating of these activities , C , is composed of E2F in complex with the Rb-related protein p107 and cyclin A ( 38 ) .
In addition , it is likely that C also contains the kinase edk2 , which was shown to be a component of a similar complex found in other human cells ( 5 , 10 ) .
A and A ' have been characterized as species of free E2F ( 38 ) .
For the purpose of our studies , `` free '' '' is defined as forms of E2F that are free to interact with Rb ( or p107 ) and the adenovirus E4 protein in gel shift assays ( 38 ; see below ) .
We undertook a detailed analysis of E2F activities in primary T cells with particular emphasis on resting T cells .
In unstimulated T cells , which are arrested in G , , we detected three E2F activities ( labeled X , Y , and Z ) with gel mobilities distinct from those of the previously defined species ( Fig .
1 ) .
In some experiments , the activity labeled Z Vor .

Unstimulated ( G , ) T-cell extracts were incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of the indicated competitor oligonucleotides ( ~- indicates no competitor added ) and a P-labeled E2F probe ( the E2pro oligonu-cleotide ) .
DHFR WT and C9 encode functional E2F binding sites .
DHFR MUT and BK encode a mutant E2F site ( unable to bind E2F ) and an unrelated DNA sequence , respectively .
The DNA binding reactions were analyzed by EMSA .
X , Y , and Z denote specific E2F DNA-binding species .
E2F DNA-binding activities present in T cells stimulated for 40 h ( complexes C , B , A , and A ' ) were analyzed in parallel for comparison ( rightmost lane ) .
The asterisks in all figures indicate a nonspecific DNA-binding activity .
( The data shown in the lane labeled stimulated are also shown in Fig .
2C [ lane marked stimulated ] .

was resolved into two bands ( see also Fig .
6B ) .
The most prominent species , X , had been noted in a previous study but was not characterized ( 38 ) .
Competition experiments ( Fig .
1 ) established that X , as well as the less prominent bands Y and Z , result from specific interactions with the E2F DNA binding site .
X , Y , and Z all disappeared upon the addition of oligonucleotides corresponding to either the E2F binding site within the DHFR promoter ( DHFR WT ) or an E2F binding site isolated by an in vitro binding site selection strategy ( C9 ) .
X , Y , and Z were not eliminated by an oligonucleotide of unrelated sequence ( BK ) or by a DHFR oligonucleotide containing a mutated E2F binding site ( DHFR MUT ) .
Thus , X , Y , and Z are all specific EZ2F DNA-binding activities , different from the A'-C set predominant in stimulated T-cell extracts .
X and Y are dissociated by adenovirus E1A and appear to contain different forms of E2F .
ElA has the ability to dissociate Rb-E2F and p107-E2F complexes ( B and C ) with a resulting increase in free E2F ( 1 , 7 , 38 ) .
This activity requires ElA sequences necessary for binding to Rb and p107 ( E1A conserved region 2 ) .
We wished to determine whether any of the E2F complexes X , Y , and Z contained Rb , p107 , or a related E1lA-binding protein .
T-cell extracts were incubated with two different bacterially expressed GST-E1A fusion proteins .
GST-E1A 976 contains wild-type E1A sequences ( residues 1 to 139 ) which are sufficient for Rb and p107 binding and disruption of Rb-E2F and p107-E2F NOVEL E2F SPECIES IN HUMAN T CELLS 3977 A 20 hr B 40 hr ( eee ine ena +GST-E1A +GST-E1A g22 _ 976 - _ gee _ are n < 4 a # 68 lnoth iB cu..

Dissociation of E2F complexes by ElA .
( A and B ) Analysis of extracts prepared from G , and S-phase cells .
T-cell extracts prepared after 20 h ( mostly G , cells ) or 40 h ( containing S-phase cells ) of mitogen stimulation were incubated with the indicated GST-E1A fusion proteins ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The reactions were then analyzed by EMSA .
The mobilities of the various E2F-specific activities are indicated ( X , C , B , A , and A ' ) .
( C ) Analysis of a G , cell extract .
An extract prepared from unstimulated human T cells was incubated with the indicated GST-E1A fusion proteins as described above and analyzed by EMSA .
The rightmost lane shows the E2F activities detected in T cells 40 h after mitogen addition .
complexes ( 38 ) .
GST-E1A 922 harbors a mutation within E1A conserved region 2 ( residues 122 to 129 deleted ) which greatly reduces binding to Rb and p107 as well as the ability to dissociate Rb-E2F and p107-E2F complexes ( 38 ) .
To test the biological activity of these E1A fusion proteins , a T-cell extract prepared 40 h after mitogen stimulation was incubated with equal quantities of GST-E1A 976 and 922 and analyzed by EMSA ( Fig .
2B ) .
As has been demonstrated previously ( 38 ) , the wild-type ( 976 ) but not the mutant ( 922 ) E1A protein dissociated both Rb-E2F and p107-E2F complexes ( bands B and C , respectively ) , resulting in an increase in free EZ2F ( consisting largely of A ) .
X predominates in unstimulated T-cell extracts ( Fig .
1 ) and continues to be the most abundant E2F activity until a significant number of cells have entered S phase ( > 24 h after 3978 - CHITTENDEN stimulation ; see below ) .
A T-cell extract prepared 20 h ( late G , ) after mitogen stimulation was incubated with either purified wild-type GST-E1A 976 or mutant GST-E1A 922 protein and then analyzed by EMSA ( Fig .
2A ) .
Treatment with wild-type GST-E1A 976 diminished X with a corresponding increase in A , a species of free E2F ( Fig .
2A ) .
The mutant GST-E1A 922 protein did not have this effect .
The degree to which X was diminished by wild-type ElA varied between experiments , with typically a 30 to 50 % decrease .
In experiments in which the E1A sensitivity of X was less pronounced than in Fig .
2A and B , there was a correspondingly less dramatic increase in band A intensity ( Fig .
2C ) .
These results imply that X contains a species of E2F ( corresponding to A ) associated with a cellular ElA-binding protein .
The inability of GST-E1A 922 to dissociate X suggests that this protein may be Rb , p107 , or another protein which binds to E1A conserved region 2 .
The minor E2F activities , Y and Z , could be detected in the experiment shown in Fig .
2A and B but only after longer exposures .
The E1A sensitivity of Y and Z was examined by similar experiments using unstimulated T-cell extracts , in which these complexes were easier to detect ( Fig .
2C ) .
In all experiments , Z appeared to be unaffected by incubation with ElA .
However , the second minor E2F species , Y , was entirely sensitive to wild-type but not mutant ElA ( Fig .
2C ) .
The ElA-induced dissociation of Y correlated with the appearance of a new E2F DNA-binding activity , labeled A '' , characterized by a gel moblhty faster than that of the previously defined E2F species ( Fig .
2C ) .
This result suggests that Y is composed of a biochemically distinct form of E2F ( A '' ) associated with a cellular E1A-binding protein .
As in the case of X , ElA conserved region 2 sequences were required for ElA dissociation of Y , again implicating Rb , p107 , or a related E1A-binding protein as an E2F-binding protein in this complex .
Additional experiments were performed to characterize A '' .
Typically , A '' was either not detectable or present in very low levels in untreated T-cell extracts and was prominent only following incubation with ElA .
To determine whether A '' is indeed a form of free E2F , we tested the ability of A '' to bind a bacterially synthesized GST-E4 protein .
An unstimulated T-cell extract was treated with wild-type GST-E1A 976 to generate sufficient levels of A '' for analysis .
The ElA-treated extracts were also incubated with either wild-type ( GST-E4 ) , or mutant ( GST-E4A14-15 ) fusion proteins ( Fig .
3 ) .
GST-E4A14-15 contains a small C-terminal deletion that abolishes the ability to interact with E2F ( 29 ) .
Addition of wild-type E4 ( but not the mutant form ) resulted in an apparent supershift of A '' ( Fig .
3 ) .
The small amount of A generated by ElA ( presumably from the partial dissociation of X ) was also supershifted by wild-type GST-E4 .
Thus , by the criteria of adenovirus E4-binding capacity , A '' is a third species of free E2F ( in addition to A and A ' ) .
Y is a novel Rb-E2F complex .
The observed dissociation of X and Y by E1A with a requirement for conserved region 2 raised the question of whether either of these E2F complexes contained Rb or p107 .
We tested whether a variety of Rb and p107 antibodies could perturb X or Y in an unstimulated T-cell extract by EMSA .
The addition of several different Rb monoclonal antibodies ( XZ140 , XZ55 , and C36 ) or a polyclonal anti-Rb antiserum ( N9 ) supershifted or ablated Y ( Fig .
4A ) , indicating that Rb is a component of complex Y .
These antibodies have also been shown to perturb Rb-E2F complex B ( reference 38 and data not shown ) ; however , they had no effect on complex X. Incubation with several p107 monoclonal antibodies ( SD4 , $ D6 , Mor .

Effects of antibodies against E2F-1 and cyclin E on E2F complexes .
( A and B ) Unstimulated T cells .
( A ) Extracts were prepared from resting T cells , incubated with the indicated antibodies , and analyzed by EMSA .
Anti-E2F-1 is an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against E2F-1 , HE111 is a cyclin E monoclonal antibody , and 423 recognizes simian virus 40 large T antigen .

( C and D ) Stimulated T cells .
Extracts were prepared 48 h after mitogen stimulation , incubated with the indicated antibodies ( see above ) , and analyzed by EMSA .
Two experiments are shown .
- , no antibody .
just above complex Z .
Although it remains possible that the epitopes for these antibodies are masked specifically in complex X , we postulate that X contains an ElA-binding protein other than Rb or p107 .
E2F-1 is a component of free E2F species A ' .
A cDNA encoding a protein with the expected properties of EZ2F ( designated E2F-1 ) has recently been cloned ( 13 , 19 , 37 ) .
To determine whether E2F-1 is present in any of the E2F complexes identified here , we tested whether a polyclonal antibody raised against E2F-1 could perturb any of the T-cell E2F activities ( Fig .
5 ) .
None of the E2F complexes detected in unstimulated T-cell extracts reacted with the anti-E2F-1 antiserum ( Fig .
5A and B ) .
Free E2F species A '' , generated by ElA treatment of an unstimulated T-cell extract , also was unaffected by the anti-E2F-1 antibody ( Fig .
5B ) .
In stimulated T-cell extracts , the anti-E2F-1 antiserum consistently eliminated free E2F species A ' ( Fig .
5C and D ) , consistent with previous results ( 19 ) .
In some experiments , complex B also appeared to be at least partly affected by the anti-E2F-1 antibody ( 19 ) ; however , this effect appeared to vary between different cell extracts .
Nevertheless , these results suggest that E2F-1 is a component of only one ( A ' ) of the three free E2F species identified here .
A cell cycle-dependent interaction between cyclin E and E2F has recently been described ( 22 ) , raising the question of whether cyclin E is present in any of the T-cell E2F complexes .
A monoclonal antibody against cyclin E ( HE111 ) failed to supershift or alter any of the E2F species detected by EMSA in unstimulated ( Fig .
5A ) or stimulated ( Fig .
5D ) T-cell extracts .
The Hell1 antibody can supershift an E2F activity in other cell extracts ( 21a ) .
Immunoprecipitation with HE111 , followed by EMSA analysis of detergent-released associated proteins , revealed a small amount of associated E2F in stimulated T-cell extracts ( data not shown ) , indicating the antibody can react with cyclin E in complex with E2F .
Thus , while we were able to detect an interaction between EZF and cyclin E in T cells , our results suggest that this may be a complex of very low abundance .
Different E2F complexes and free E2F species exhibit distinct cell cycle behaviors .
We examined whether the levels of the various EZF species described above vary throughout the cell cycle .
In one approach , resting T cells were stimulated with mitogens and E2F complexes were analyzed by EMSA at various times later as the cells exited G , and entered the cell cycle .
Figure 6A shows an experiment in which resting T cells ( 0 h ) were stimulated with mitogens and extracts were prepared at 20 or 40 h later .
Consistent with previous results ( 38 ) , the p107 complex C appeared only after cells had entered S phase ( 40 h ) .
Also , as previously reported ( 38 ) , the Rb-E2F complex B was not detected in unstimulated cells ( 0 h , G , , ) , was present at low levels at 20 h ( predominantly G , ) , and was prominent at the 40-h time point ( entry into S ) .
The minor Rb-E2F complex , Y , was present in unstimulated cells ( 0 h ; Fig .
6A [ seen better in Fig .
1 and 2C ) ) ; thus , the two Rb-E2F complexes display somewhat different temporal regulation .
Because of the abundance of other complexes migrating nearby , it was difficult to determine whether Y and Z persisted through G ; and/or into S. The two major species of free E2F , A and A ' , displayed quite different cell cycle kinetics .
A ' was not detected until cells entered S phase ( Fig .
6A , 40 h ) .
By contrast to A ' , A was readily detectable at earlier times ( 20 h ) .
Indeed , we were able to detect A as early as 6 h after mitogen stimulation ( Fig .
6B ) .
While A was not detected at 0 h , it could be generated in unstimulated cell extracts by incubation with EIA ( Fig .
2C ) , whereas ElA treatments of G , cell extracts never generated detectable levels of A ' .
One interpretation of these results is that the form of E2F responsible for A is present in G , , although not in its free form ( A ) but instead sequestered in complex X ( see above ) .
Thus , the two major forms of free E2F behaved differently ; A first appeared 3980 CHITTENDEN competit FIG .

Elutriation experiments yielded analogous findings regarding the temporal regulation of different E2F species .
A preparation of mitogen-stimulated T cells ( 43 h poststimula-tion ) , was fractionated by centrifugal elutriation .
Extracts were prepared from G , - and S-phase-enriched cell fractions ( as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting [ FACS ] analysis ) , and E2ZF DNA-binding activities were monitored by EMSA ( Fig .
7 ) .
The p107-cyclin A complex ( C ) appeared only in fractions containing S-phase cells ( Fig .
7 , fractions 6 through 9 ) .
The major Rb-E2F complex ( B ) , while present in G , ( seen more clearly on longer exposures ) , persisted in all S-phase fractions ( Fig .
7 , fractions 6 through 9 ) , consistent with previous findings ( 38 ) .
The behavior of the minor Rb-EZF complex , Y , appeared to parallel that of B .
By contrast to Rb-EZF complexes , X was restricted almost completely to G/G , -enriched fractions ( Fig .
7 , fractions 3 through 6 ) .
Z could be detected only after long exposures , and it was not possible to determine whether its abundance varied in the cell cycle .
Levels of the two major free E2F species A and A ' again displayed differences in cell cycle dependency ( Fig .
7 ) .
A was detected in both G , and S fractions but was less abundant in G , .
A ' was nearly absent in early G , fractions and increased substantially in late G , /early S phase ( Fig .
7 , fractions 6 through 9 ) .
This finding is consistent with the results described above ( Fig .
6 ) showing that A appeared shortly after stimulation of resting T cells ( early G ; ) , whereas A ' was not detected until the G , /S transition .
It was not possible to decipher the kinetics of A '' , given its relatively low abundance in the absence of exposure to ElA .
UV cross-linking provides additional evidence for biochemically distinct forms of E2F .
The wide variety of E2F activities observed in these experiments may result from a single transcription factor interacting with multiple different cellular proteins .
The diversity of E2F complexes may also result Mor .

from the presence of multiple E2F species ( i.e. , a family of related transcription factors with E2F DNA-binding activi-ty ) , at least some of which form complexes with a variety of cellular proteins .
As one approach to investigating whether different E2F species are present in various E2F complexes , we performed UV cross-linking experiments .
Gel shift experiments were carried out with a BuDR-substituted °P-labeled EZF binding site probe .
Following native gel electrophoresis , the gel was irradiated with UV light in order to covalently cross-link the probe to the DNA-binding protein ( s ) .
Individual bands corresponding to E2F complexes A , B , C , and X were excised from the gel , and the °°P photoaffinity-labeled protein within these bands was fractionated by SDS-gel electrophoresis ( Fig .
8 ) .
As a control , a nonspecific band ( lane NS ) was also excised and analyzed in parallel .
Cross-linking experiments with the minor E2F species ( Y , Z , and A '' ) proved difficult because of the low abundance of these species and were not informa-tive .
A protein ( s ) with an approximate molecular mass of 56 kDa ( relative to prestained markers ) was cross-linked in each E2F complex ( Fig .
8A ) , which is in agreement with previous reports on the molecular weight of E2F ( 43 ) .
The 56-kDa band in lane B was faint in the exposure shown .
Proteins with small differences in molecular weight might not be resolved on this gel .
However , even at this resolution , it is clear that two proteins ( approximately 56 and 60 kDa ) emerged from the cross-linking of C , the p107-cyclin A-E2F complex .
The 60-kDa protein was specific to complex C and was not cross-linked in any of the other E2F complexes examined , whereas the faster-migrating band was indistinguishable by gel migration from that emerging from complexes X , A , and B .
Identical results were obtained upon Vor .

analysis of E2F complexes in the human promonocytic leukemia cell line U937 .
Complex C in U937 cells yielded two cross-linked proteins with approximate molecular masses of 56 and 60 kDa ( Fig .
8B ) .
These findings suggest that the S-phase p107-E2F complex contains an E2F DNA-binding protein of greater molecular weight than those found in other E2F complexes and imply that p107 interacts with at least two different E2F species .
The 60-kDa protein might be an E2F species of different primary sequence , the same primary but different covalent modification structure , or both .
DISCUSSION An increasingly complex picture of E2F and its cell cycle regulation has emerged from the analysis of E2F in primary human T cells .
We wish to summarize here the main findings obtained in this study .
First , several new E2F DNA-binding activities were identified and characterized .
These include an additional Rb-EZF complex ( Y ) distinct from the previously identified complex ( B ) , a novel form of free E2F ( A '' ) , a more slowly migrating species of completely unknown composition ( Z ) , and an E2F complex ( X ) restricted to Gy/G , that appears to involve an interaction with an El1A-binding protein possibly different from Rb or p107 ( discussed below ) .
Second , the results provide evidence for significant biochemical diversity in the DNA-binding activities that have collectively been termed E2F .
Three forms of free E2F ( A , A ' , and A '' ) with distinctly different gel mobilities were resolved in EMSAs , and at least two proteins of different molecular weights were photoaffinity labeled in UV cross-linking experiments .
Third , experiments with synchronized cells demonstrated that the two major free E2F species ( A and A ' ) displayed distinct behavior within the cell cycle .
These observations raise the possibility ( see below ) that different species of free E2F perform different biological functions .
NOVEL E2F SPECIES IN HUMAN T CELLS 3981 Of the additional E2F complexes described in this report , X is of particular interest .
X is by far the most abundant G/G , E2F DNA-binding activity .
The temporal pattern of X is tightly restricted to G , and G , , unlike the case for Rb-E2F complexes , which are also found in S phase .
In this regard , the behavior of X more closely fits what might be predicted for a negative regulator of E2F function , since cells must prevent E2F from activating growth-responsive genes at inappropriate times ( i.e. , in G , ) .
The ElA-binding protein that is a component of X may function to sequester E2F and prevent its function as a transcriptional activation .
Alterna-tively , since X binds E2F sites , X may actively function as a repressor by binding to E2F-responsive promoters .
Such a function has already been postulated for Rb-EZF complexes ( 41 ) .
If so , it is possible that X represents an important target for ElA in naturally occurring adenovirus infections of resting cells .
What is the composition of X ?
The results presented here suggest that one component of X is an E1A-binding protein other than Rb or p107 .
Antibodies to Rb and p107 which successfully supershifted Rb-E2F and p107-E2F complexes failed to alter X , yet ElA dissociation of X required ElA conserved region 2 .
At least three cellular proteins in addition to Rb and p107 bind ElA with a requirement for this sequence : p80 , p90 , and p130 ( 11 , 42 ) .
The gel mobility of X , migrating slightly more slowly than the major Rb-E2F complex , makes p130 an attractive candidate .
However , it should be noted that a G ; -restricted E2F complex detected in NIH 3T3 cells ( 27 ) reacts with a polyclonal p107 antiserum ( cited in reference 30 as J. K. Schwarz et al. , unpublished data [ 36a ) ) .
A current question is whether it is the murine equivalent of X .
Presently , our conclusions are limited to stating that the p107 antibodies used in our study failed to react with X , although they did supershift the S-phase plQ07-cyclin A-E2F complex .
It is interesting to note that X was largely absent from many transformed cell lines tested to date , including U937 , Rb27 , U2OS , SAOS2 , and HeLa ( reference 38 and data not shown ) .
The failure to detect X may not simply be due to insufficient G , cells in transformed cell cultures , since X was not detected even in G , -enriched U937 cell fractions following elutriation ( 38 ) .
X does not appear to be specific to primary T cells , since we have detected a complex with electrophoretic mobility identical to that of X in the non-transformed diploid human fibroblast line MRC-5 ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , Pagano et al .
( 32 ) detected a Gy/G ; -specific complex in primary human fibroblasts with a similar gel mobility .
An interesting possibility is that X is frequently lost or disrupted in transformed cells .
If X is a negative regulator of E2F function , perhaps its loss contributes to deregulation of growth-responsive promoters and the transformation process .
It has been reported that free E2F is the form active in stimulating transcription ( 1 ) .
As demonstrated in this work , there are at least three forms of free E2F that can be resolved in EMSAs ( A , A ' , and A '' ) .
If free E2F is the form responsible for activation of cellular promoters ( a possibility that remains to be proven ) , it is of particular interest to note the different cell cycle kinetics of the two predominant species of free E2F .
As might be expected , no free E2F was detected in unstimulated T cells ( G , , ) .
Shortly after mitogen stimulation ( between 0 and 6 h ) , free E2F species A appeared , and it was not until the G , /S transition ( 24 to 36 h poststimula-tion ) that A ' was first detected .
This temporal regulation suggests a scenario wherein A activates immediate-early E2F-responsive promoters such as the c-myc promoter , 3982 CHITTENDEN whereas A ' functions primarily at promoters activated at G , /S , such as the DHFR promoter .
In elutriated cells , A ' was most abundant in late G , /early S-phase fractions , again consistent with a role for A ' in activating genes at the G , /S transition .
Several explanations could account for the observed diversity of free E2F species .
It seems unlikely that the different forms of free E2F described here simply reflect in vitro proteolysis of a single progenitor species .
The relative levels of A and A ' do not vary following repeated freeze-thawings of a cell extract and appeared and disappeared in a reproducible cell cycle-dependent manner .
Furthermore , since A and A ' exhibit different cell cycle behaviors , if proteolysis accounted for their existence , it too would have to be cell cycle dependent .
More to the point , if A ' and A '' are indeed degradation products , they have been proteo-lyzed in such a way as to retain DNA-binding activity and to have the potential to associate with E4 and Rb .
It is possible that other posttranslational modifications such as dimeriza-tion or phosphorylation account for some heterogeneity of E2F activities .
A ' , for example , could be generated by a posttranslational modification of A , such as phosphoryla-tion , occurring in late G , /early S. UV cross-linking of E2F complex C yielded two proteins of 56 and 60 kDa .
The larger of these could be a phosphorylated form of the smaller , and if so , E2F could conceivably be a substrate of the cyclin A/cdk2 kinase present in C. An alternative , but not mutually exclusive , possibility is that heterogeneity of E2F activities may be explained by the existence of a family of related E2F DNA-binding proteins .
If so , the different free E2F species ( A , A ' , and A '' ) may be the products of several related genes .
There is ample precedence for families of related transcription factors all recognizing similar DNA sequences ( 18 ) .
One cDNA for E2F ( designated E2F-1 ) has been cloned ( 13 , 19 , 37 ) .
However , additional clones with related structure have recently been isolated ( 22a ) .
A polyclonal antiserum raised against E2F-1 reacted with A ' but did not perturb either A or A '' ( Fig .
5 ) , providing evidence that A and A '' are immunologically distinct from A ' and thus may be gene products different from E2F-1 .
The conclusion that E2F-1 is solely a component of A ' is consistent with Northern ( RNA ) analysis of E2F-1 gene expression ( 19 ) .
The EZF-1 mRNA was not detected in unstimulated T cells , and the temporal appearance of the EZF-1 message following mitogen stimulation correlates with the appearance of A ' by EMSA analysis .
If these various species of free E2F are different members of an E2F gene family , the data presented here suggest that they may , in part , function at different points in the cell cycle .
In addition , one could speculate that different E2F family members selectively interact with different cellular proteins , such as Rb , p107 , and perhaps other nuclear pocket proteins .
A ' , for example , does not seem to be a component of X .
The 60-kDa protein identified by UV cross-linking appeared specifically in the p107 complex , implying that this form may interact exclusively with p107 , not with Rb or the E2F-binding protein in complex X .
A major challenge for the future will be to determine in detail the nature of the E2F gene product ( s ) present in the various complexes and when , where , and how these complexes operate during the cell cycle .
