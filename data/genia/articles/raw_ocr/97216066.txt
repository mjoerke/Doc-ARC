We questioned whether these differences might reflect patterns of intracellular signal transduction .
Stimulation with either PAF or FMLP resulted in equivalent phosphorylation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) homologue 38-kD murine MAP kinase homologous to HOG-1 ( p38 ) MAPk .
Neither FMLP nor PAF activated c-jun NH , -terminal MAPk ( JNKs ) .
Under identical conditions , FMLP but not PAF , resulted in significant p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPK activation .
Both FMLP and PAF activated MAP kinase kinase-3 ( MKK3 ) , a known activator of p38 MAPk .
Both MAP ERK kinase kinase-1 ( MEKK1 ) and Raf are activated strongly by FMLP , but minimally by PAF .
Pertussis toxin blocked FMLP-induced activation of the p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPK cas-cade , but not that of p38 MAPK .
A specific p38 MAPK inhibitor ( SK & F 86002 ) blocked superoxide anion production in response to FMLP and reduced adhesion and chemotaxis in response to PAF or FMLP .
These results demonstrate distinct patterns of intracellular signaling for two chemoattractants and suggest that selective activation of intracellular signaling cascades may underlie different patterns of functional responses .

Key words : MAP kinases + superoxide « adhesion « neutrophil activation « pertussis toxins Introduction Stimulation of human neutrophils by chemoattractants results in their accumulation at sites of inflammation and the initiation of a spectrum of responses that may contribute to tissue injury .
In the adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) massive neutrophil accumulation in the lung is associated with significant lung injury , while in other disease processes neutrophil accumulation can result in negligible tissue injury ( 1 , 2 ) .
The observation that different stimuli can result in different responses appears to offer clues as to the regulatory mechanism J .

Two stimuli that highlight potential differences in events leading to neutrophil activation are the chemoattractants FMLP ( 3 ) , and platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) ( 4 ) .
While both of these compounds are potent stimulators of multiple functional responses in human neutrophils , the repertoire of responses elicited by each is distinctly different .
Exposure to FMLP results in a broad range of rapid functional responses including actin assembly , adherence , calcium influx , chemokinesis , chemotaxis , superoxide production and granule enzyme release ( 5 ) .
While a number of functional responses induced by PAF stimulation are similar to those induced by FMLP , some important differences have been noted .
Of particular interest is the relative inability of neutrophils to produce superoxide anion after PAF stimulation .
At high concentrations PAF is a much weaker agonist for release of superoxide anion and granule constituents than is FMLP , and under physiologic conditions PAF-induced superoxide anion release is minimal ( 6 , 7 ) .
Superoxide production has long been recognized as an important component in host defense , as well as a contributor to the pathogenesis of lung injury in certain inflammatory dis-eases .
Individuals whose neutrophils lack the ability to produce superoxide , as in chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) , suffer from recurrent bacterial and fungal infections ( 8 ) .
Whereas excess superoxide production contributes to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury ( 9 ) .
Both FMLP ( 10 ) and PAF ( 11 , 12 ) bind to the neutrophil cell surface via members of the seven trans-membrane spanning G-protein linked receptor family .
After receptor activa-tion , specificity of the functional response might occur through activation of distinct and separate effector pathways ( as shown in yeast ) , or through combinatorial mechanisms .
We have begun to address the central hypothesis that specific functional responses in neutrophils are regulated through the preferential utilization of intracellular signaling pathways resulting from the binding of stimuli to cell surface receptors .

Platelet Activating Factor and FMLP Induced Intracellular Signaling in Neutrophils 975 have indicated that the binding of FMLP to a seven transmembrane spanning receptor on the surface of human neutrophils initiates a sequence of protein phosphorylation events including the activation of the Ras-dependent kinases [ Raf and MAP/ERK kinase kinase-1 ( MEKK-1 ) ] ( 13 ) which then phosphorylate and activate the MAP/ERK kinases ( MEK-1 and MEK-2 ) which in turn activate the p42/44 ( ERK ) mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPk ) ( 14-16 ) .
The activation of kinases in this pathway is maximal within 1-2 min after exposure to FMLP .
Little is known about the intracellular signaling pathway utilized by the human neutrophil in response to PAF stimulation .
PAF binding to its seven trans-membrane spanning G-protein linked receptor stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins ( 17 ) , these intracellular signaling events do not appear to include significant activation of either MEK-1 ( 18 ) or MEK-2 ( 19 ) .
If heterogeneity of neutrophil responses is reflected in selective utilization of intracellular signaling pathways , these differences might ultimately result in distinct patterns of MAP kinase activation .
In addition to p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPK , at least two distinct families of MAP kinase exist in mammalian cells .
Known MAP kinase family members include the c-Jun N-terminal MAPk ( JNKs ) , and the 38-kD murine MAP kinase homologous to HOG-1 ( p38 ) MAPk ( named based on its molecular weight in murine cells ) both of which can be activated by various `` stress '' stimuli in mammalian cells ( 20-23 ) .
We now report that FMLP strongly activates both p38 MAPk and p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk , while PAF preferentially activates p38 MAPk .
The activation of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk by FMLP occurs through activation of MEK1/MEK2 , while activation of p38 MAPk by FMLP and PAF appears to occur through the activation of MAP kinase kinase 3 ( MKK3 ) .
Specific inhibition of p38 MAPk by a bicyclic imidazole ( SK & F 86002 ) results in selective loss of functional responses to FMLP or PAF stimulation .
These results allow for the most complete analysis to date of intracellular signaling pathways used by two distinct chemoattractants via seven-transmembrane spanning receptors , corresponding to different functional responses .

The p38 MAPk was immunoprecipitated with p38 MAPk antisera and the immunoblot was stained with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPk is visible after stimulation with 1 nM ( 10~° M ) for both stimuli .
( B ) Activity of p38 MAPk was determined by *P phosphorylation of ATF-21_110 for each concentration of FMLP or PAF .
The activity was quantified tions of both FMLP and PAF in a roughly equivalent manner ( Fig .

Similarly , the relative amount of p38 MAPk enzymatic activity as measured by the P phosphorylation of ATF-211 ; , increased with increasing concentrations of stimuli ( Fig .

Restaining of the blot from Fig .

Time course of p38 MAPK activation and phosphorylation after exposure to FMLP or PAF .
The time course of phosphorylation of p38 MAP k after stimulation with FMLP ( 10-8 M ) or PAF ( 10-8 M ) was determined by immunoprecipitation of neutrophil cell lysates with p38 MAPk antisera followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody .
The activity of the p38 MAP kinase was measured by its ability to phosphorylate ATF-2 j , .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPk in neutrophils stimulated with FMLP is greatest at ~ 90 s , while the phosphorylation of p38 MAPk in PAF stimulated cells peaks at about 120 s ( Fig .

The time course of p38 MAPk activity is seen to closely reflect the phosphorylation of the protein ( Fig .

Together the results from Figs .

Concentration dependence of FMLP and PAF activation of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPK .
The activation and phosphorylation of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk was also determined after exposure of cells to a range of FMLP and PAF concentrations ( Fig .

FMLP was found to be a significantly more potent activator of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk than PAF at each concentration tested .

The p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk was immunoprecipitated with an anti-p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk antibody , separated by SDS-PAGE , and the immunoblot was stained with a different anti-p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk antibody .

Restaining of the immunoblot with an anti-ERK MAPk antibody demonstrates equal amounts of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk were immunoprecipitated for each condition ( Fig .

Time course of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPK activation after exposure to FMLP and PAF .
Activation of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk after stimulation of human neutrophils with FMLP has been shown previously to occur in a time and dose dependent manner ( 14 , 15 ) .
As demonstrated in Fig .
2 , the p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk in human neutrophils is not activated after 90 s of exposure to PAF ( 10-8 M ) .
To determine whether PAF results in a delayed activation of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk , neutrophils were exposed to either FMLP or PAF over a range of time intervals 807 707 T so- T 1 I so- mil | 40 MAP kinase activity ( cpm x10 ) I I I I I I I I 1 1 0 O1 2 3 4 5 60 70 8 9 10 Time ( min ) Figure 7 .

Neutrophils stimulated with 10 M FMLP ( EM ) or 10 M PAF ( O ) over a range of time intervals were immunoprecipitated with anti-p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk antibody .

At all times indi-cated , the activity of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk immunoprecipitated from neutrophils stimulated by FMLP is significantly greater than the activity in cells exposed to PAF .
Both chemoattractants achieve maximal p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk phosphorylation of EGFRsyq-4s , within 2 min , but the relatively small PAF induced response declines thereafter , while the response to FMLP is maintained through 10 min .
Together , the results from Figs .
2 , 6 , and 7 demonstrate stimulation of neutrophils with FMLP results in significantly greater activation of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk then does PAF over the identical range of stimuli concentration and time intervals .
Activation of MKK3 after exposure of human neutrophils to FMLP and PAF .
Two recently cloned human MAP kinase kinases ( MKK3 and MKK4 ) have been shown to phosphorylate and activate p38 MAPk ( but not p42/44 [ ERK ] MAPK ) when overexpressed in COS cells .
To determine whether MKK3 may play a role in the activation of p38 MAPk after exposure to FMLP or PAF , we expressed recombinant human kinase active p38 MAPk , , and inactive p38 MAPK , , forms of p38 MAPk .
These were utilized as substrates for an in vitro kinase assay in which immunoprecipitated MKK3 was incubated with p38 MAP k ; , in the presence of [ y-*P ] ATP followed by separation with SDS-PAGE .
Neutrophils stimulated with FMLP or PAF demonstrated equivalent amounts of MKK3 activation as quantified by phosphorimaging of °P phosphorylation of p38 MAPk , , ( Fig .
8 C ) and in a representative autoradiograph ( Fig .
8 B ) .
Restaining of the immunoblot with an anti-MKK3 antibody confirms equal amounts of MKK3 were immunoprecipitated for each stimuli ( Fig .
8 A ) .
In contrast , FMLP is capable of significant activation of MEK1/MEK2 , but PAF stimulation results in only slight activation of MEK1 and negligible activation of MEK2 ( 13 , 19 ) .

PAF weakly activates Raf and MEKK1I .
The chemoattractant FMLP has been shown to robustly activate both C-Raf-1 and B-Raf in a time dependent manner ( 16 ) .
We questioned whether PAF would similarly activate c-Raf-1 .
Neutrophils were stimulated by either PAF or FMLP for varying time intervals and lysates immunoprecipitated by anti-c-Raf-1 antise-rum .
Activation of Raf was determined by in vitro kinase assays in which P phosphorylation of the substrate MEK ; , , was qualified by autoradiography after separation by SDS-PAGE .
As shown in Fig .
9 A , PAF ( 107 M ) stimulation of neutrophils induces slight activation of c-Raf-1 , resulting in weak phosphorylation of MEK I ; , as compared with neutrophils stimulated with FMLP ( 107 M ) for 60 s. Raf activation in response to FMLP occurs within 30 s , is optimal by 2 min and plateaus over a 5-min interval ( 13 ) .
In contrast , the activation of this kinase in response to PAF appears to be delayed and of a much lesser magnitude , when compared with FMLP .
Recently , we have demonstrated that in FMLP stimulated neutrophils , MEKK1 is activated and in turn phosphorylates a recombinant human kinase inactive MEK 1L , , , ( 13 ) .
The ability of PAF stimulation to induce activation of MEKK1 was tested in an identical manner ( Fig .

incubated in the presence of pertussis toxin ( PTX ) , an inhibitor of G , , , and G , , ; ( « subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins ) , were compared with neutrophils incubated in the absence of PTX .
After stimulation with FMLP or PAF , the activity of the p38 MAPk was not clearly suppressed by PTX pre-incubation ( Fig .
10 A ) .
Simultaneously , neutrophils incubated with PTX and then stimulated with FMLP were shown to have significant inhibition of p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk activity ( Fig .
10 B ) .
A relatively high level of p38 MAPK activity in unstimulated samples was noted for both neutrophils incubated with PTX as well as those incubated in buffer , due to non-specific activation of the cells as a result of the prolonged incubation .
This result indicates that substantial p38 MAPk activation occurs through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway .
Effect of p38 MAPK inhibition on neutrophil responses after stimulation with FMLP or PAF .
A bicyclic imidazole , SK & F 86002 , is a member of a class of compounds that has been demonstrated to specifically inhibit p38 MAPk activity with negligible effect on other MAP kinase members , MEK1 , or c-Raf ( 34-36 ) .
Immunoprecipitated p38 MAPk from PAF or FMLP activated neutrophils was inhibited in a concentration dependent manner by SK & F 86002 with a greater then 95 % decrease in activity at the highest level of inhibitor studied ( Fig .
11 A ) .
In contrast , p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk immunoprecipitated from neutrophils after FMLP stimulation showed ~ 20 % reduction of activity in the presence of 10 uM SK & F 86002 ( Fig .
11 A ) .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPk was equivalent for each concentration of SK & F 86002 studied ( data not shown ) , confirming earlier reports that this compound does not inhibit `` upstream '' activators of p38 MAPk .
Neutrophils incubated in identical concentrations of SK & F 86002 ( 0.1-10 M ) for 60 min demonstrated a concentration dependent loss of superoxide anion production in response to stimulation by FMLP ( Fig .
11 B ) .
PMA , a direct activator of protein kinase C ( PKC ) is known to induce the respiratory burst in neutrophils independent of mechanisms utilized by FMLP ( 37 ) .
PMA-induced superoxide anion release was not inhibited by SK & F 86002 , demonstrating that pretreatment with SK & F 86002 does not result in a nonspecific loss of the respiratory burst or decreased cellular activity .

Pretreatment with SK & F 86002 resulted in significant decrease in neutrophil adhesion in response to PAF , and to a lesser extent with FMLP ( Fig .
11 C ) .
Chemotaxis in response to FMLP was significantly inhibited by 10 pM SK & F 86002 , while chemokinesis was unchanged ( Fig .
11 D ) .
Similar effects in response to PAF were observed , although relatively low levels of chemotaxis and chemokinesis in response to PAF made these differences statistically not significant ( data not shown ) .
Inhibition of p38 MAPk with SK & F 86002 did not result in substantial changes in actin assembly ( Fig .
11 E ) or intracellular calcium mobilization ( Fig .
11 F ) in response to either PAF or FMLP .
These results support the conclusion that activation of p38 MAPk contributes to FMLP-induced superoxide anion release , adhesion and chemotaxis as well as PAF-induced adhesion .
Discussion The stimulation of human neutrophils with FMLP or with PAF occurs via binding of distinct seven transmembrane G protein-linked cell surface receptors .
Exposure of the cell to FMLP then results in the activation of Ras , which activates the serine/threonine kinase Raf .
Ras also regulates the activation of MEKK-1 .
Both MEKK-1 and Raf when activated have been shown to phosphorylate and activate MEK1/MEK2 , which in turn serves to activate p42/44 ( ERK ) MAP kinases .
In this report we demonstrate that stimulation of neutrophils with [ Ca®+* ] ; mobilization after FMLP or PAF stimulation of neutrophils not exposed to SK & F 86002 .
Each value represents the mean and SEM from three experiments .
Platelet Activating Factor and FMLP Induced Intracellular Signaling in Neutrophils 983 PAF results in minor utilization of this intracellular signaling pathway , with only slight activation of p42/p44 ( ERK ) MAP kinases , MEK1/MEK2 , Raf , or MEKK-1 .
To a much greater extent , intracellular signal transduction after exposure of the neutrophil to PAF occurs through a parallel signaling pathway resulting in the activation of MKK3 and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAPk ( Fig .
12 ) .
In addition , we report that stimulation with FMLP also results in the activation of MKK3 and p38 MAP k in a time and concentration dependent manner equivalent to PAF .
In contrast to FMLP activation of the Raf , MEK1/MEK2 and p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk cascade ( 16 , 38 ) , the activation of p38 MAPk appears to be largely independent of inhibition by PTX .
Neither FMLP or PAF were shown to activate JNKs in the human neutrophil ( data not shown ) .
The ability of FMLP to robustly activate at least two members of the MAP kinase family as opposed to PAF which predominantly activates p38 MAPk is reflected in a wider range of functional responses evoked by FMLP stimulation .
FMLP and PAF induce comparable neutrophil adhesion and actin assembly , but only FMLP stimulation results in significant superoxide production .
Through use of the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SK & F 86002 ( 35 , 36 ) we have shown that the FMLP induced release of superoxide anion is dependent on the activation of p38 MAPk .
However , p38 MAPk activation alone is not sufficient , as demonstrated by the relative inability of PAF stimulation to induce superoxide anion release .
The ability of PMA , ( a direct activator of PKC , but a weak activator of p38 MAPk in the human neutrophil ( 25 ) to induce superoxide release not inhibited by SK & F 86002 supports the conclusion that mechanisms independent of p38 MAPk activation can also mediate superoxide anion release .
Both adhesion after PAF or FMLP stimulation , and FMLP-induced chemotaxis were reduced by p38 MAPk inhibition , but the responses were not eliminated .
In contrast , FMLP-induced chemokinesis , as well as actin assembly and intracellular calcium mobilization after stimulation with FMLP or PAF do not appear to be specifically inhibited by SK & F 86002 .
These findings support the conclusion that p38 MAPk activation is involved in adhesion and chemotaxis of the neutrophil in response to FMLP , but that other signaling events are required as well .
Involvement of p38 MAPk in actin assembly , chemokinesis or intracellular calcium mobilization is not supported by our data .
Important clues as to the functional roles of MAP kinase family members in human neutrophils will come from determination of the substrates for these kinases .
In a number of cell lines , activation of MAP kinases has been shown to result in increased transcription , either directly or through phosphorylation of transcription factors .
However , the rapid functional response of human neutrophils to pro-inflammatory stimuli occurs independent of protein synthesis , and thus other substrates are likely involved .
To date , several direct actions of MAP kinases have been identified .
Activated p42 ( ERK ) MAPk directly phosphorylates cytoplasmic phospholipase A ; ( ecPLA ; ) , allowing for the release of arachidonic acid ( 39 , 40 ) .
Recently it has been demonstrated that p38 MAPk phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase-activated protein ( MAPKAP ) kinase-2 ( 36 , 41 ) and MAPKAP kinase-3 ( 42 ) which in turn phosphorylates heat shock protein ( HSP ) 27 in certain cell lines in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli or hyperosmotic conditions .
The substrates phosphorylated by p38 MAPk in the neutrophil resulting in superoxide anion release , adhesion , and chemotaxis have yet to be identified .
984 - Nick et al .
Of considerable interest is the upstream regulation event that enables FMLP to activate parallel intracellular signaling pathways , while limiting activation in response to PAF to a single MAP kinase cascade .
One point of possible signal divergence is the activation of G-proteins linked to seven transmembrane-spanning receptors .
Activation of human neutrophils with FMLP has been shown to utilize the G-protein « subunit a ; , as PTX can inhibit the majority of Raf and Ras activation ( 16 ) .
Lack of significant PTX inhibition of p38 MAPK activity after stimulation of neutrophils with FMLP or PAF argues for signal transduction mediated in part by PTX-insensitive G-proteins .
The PAF receptor expressed in COS cells has been shown to interact with PTX-insensitive G-proteins ( possibly G. , , and G , , ) ( 43 ) .
The PAF receptor transfected in CHO cells allows for p42/44 ( ERK ) MAPk activation in response to PAF stimulation , with evidence for PAF receptor coupling to both PTX-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins ( 44 ) .
Early reports of inhibition of PAF mediated response by PTX utilized a 30-fold greater concentration of inhibitor than used here , and the effect reported may not have been specific to G-protein inhibition ( 45 , 46 ) .
Complete definition of the pattern of MEKK and MKK activation in response to stimulation with FMLP and PAF will provide important clues as to the point of convergence for the FMLP and PAF signaling pathway .
Recent identification and cloning of MKK3 and MKK4 has established that both MKK3 and MKK4 can phosphorylate recombinant p38 MAP k in vitro ( although MKK4 is also capable of activating JNK ) .
When MKK3 and MKK4 were transfected and overexpressed in COS-1 cells a resulting activation of p38 MAP kinase was observed ( MKK4 overexpression also led to increased JNK activ-ity ) ( 47 ) .
Exposure of human neutrophils to FMLP or PAF resulted in activation of MKK3 as determined by the ability of the immunoprecipitated kinase to phosphorylate kinase inactive recombinant human p38 MAPk ( p38 MAPk ; , , ) .
The phosphorylation of p38 MAPk by activated MKK3 could also result in activation of wild type recombinant human p38 MAPk ( p38 MAPk , , , ) , confirming the specificity of the phosphorylation ( data not shown ) .
Our observation that JNK is not activated in response to FMLP or PAF supports the suggestion that the MKK responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of mammalian p38 MAP kinase is probably not MKK4 which has been implicated as upstream in the JNK signaling pathway ( 47 , 48 ) .
The exact relationship of the MAPk cascades to other known signaling events in human neutrophils remains unclear .
Stimulation of neutrophils with FMLP via G protein-coupled receptors results in rapid activation of phospholipase C ( 49 , 50 ) , phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D ( 51 ) , inosi-tol-1,4,5-triphosphate induced mobilization of [ Ca '' + ] ; ( 52 ) and PKC ( 53 , 54 ) .
Activation of MAPk-family members ( via MEKK and MEK homologues ) may occur `` downstream '' to the activation of phospholipase C , D , and PKC or alternatively be activated in parallel to earlier described signaling mechanisms .
Important functional responses such as activation of NAPDH oxidase leading directly to superoxide anion production likely occurs through more then one signal transduction pathway , depending on the type and concentration of stimuli tested .
Inhibitors against various signaling events have provided clues , but relative lack of specificity of these agents in vivo limit the usefulness of these studies .
Systematic elucidation of the hierarchy of signaling events that occurs under physiologic conditions in response to a wide variety of stimuli in neutrophils will present a formidable challenge , and will likely require a variety of new techniques , including genetic manipulation of primary cells .
The selective activation of MAP kinase family members by different stimuli provides a framework in which to study the range of potential neutrophil response in the setting of inflam-mation .
To date , p38 MAPK has been classified as a `` stress activated '' MAP kinase homologue , as initial activation was reported in response to such agents as hyperosmolarity , endo-toxin , and TNF .
More recently , such stimuli as thrombin have been reported to activate p38 MAPk in platelets ( 55 ) .
This report of p38 MAPk activation in response to chemoattractants via two serpentine receptors establishes that p38 MAPk is widely utilized , and activation of this kinase is associated with a number of functional responses in neutrophils .
Our findings support the idea that fine regulation of neutrophil activation occurs through differences in activation of a spectrum of signaling pathways .
For each stimuli capable of a unique set of cellular responses , a distinctive `` fingerprint '' of signal protein activation may exist , or instead , various combinations of signaling pathways may be used .
Ultimately , through more complete understanding of intracellular signaling , sophisticated approaches to selective inflammatory blockade can be designed .
