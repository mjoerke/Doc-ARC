CHEMOKINES Nuclear Induction of Interleukin-8 Gene Expression by Tumor Necrosis Factor « ; Evidence for an Antioxidant Sensitive Activating Pathway Distinct From Nuclear Translocation By Spiros Vliahopoulos , Istvan Boldogh , Antonella Casola , and Allan R. Brasier Tumor necrosis factor « ( TNFa ) is a pluripotent activator of inflammation by inducing a proinflammatory cytokine cascade .
This phenomenon is mediated , in part , through inducible expression of the CXC chemokine , interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) .
In this study , we investigate the role of TNFa « -inducible reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in IL-8 expression by `` monocyte-like '' U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells .
TNFa is a rapid activator of IL-8 gene expression by U937 , producing a 50-fold induction of mRNA within 1 hour of treatment .
In gene transfection assays , the effect of TNFa requires the presence of an inducible nuclear factor-kB ( NF- « B ) ( Rel A ) binding site in the IL-8 promoter .
TNFa treatment induces a rapid translocation of the 65 kD transcriptional activator subunit , Rel A , whose binding in the nucleus occurs before changes in HE PLURIPOTENT CYTOKINE tumor necrosis factor a ( TNFa ) has been shown to be an endogenous mediator of inflammation and cellular immune responses . !
Binding to ubiquitously expressed receptors , TNFa is capable of eliciting a wide spectrum of physiologic and cellular responses to acute endotoxemia , acute respiratory distress syndrome , and infection with protozoal , bacterial , and viral pathogens .
In circulating blood , monocytes are important target cells of TNFa action where it induces parallel cellular ( enhanced cytotoxic capacity ) and genetic programs ( enhanced secretion of additional inflammatory mediators , including interleukin-1 [ IL-1 ] , IL-8 , and platelet activating factor ) that allow acquisition of a phagocytic phenotype .
In fact , monocytic cells represent the major source of TNFa-inducible IL-8 secretion in human blood .
* The actions of TNFa are mediated by single transmembrane spanning receptors lacking intrinsic kinase activity ( reviewed in Smith et al '' ) .
Circulating and binding as a trimeric peptide , TNFa induces receptor trimerization .
Trimerization , an event required for receptor activation , results in protein recruitment to the intracellular ( cytoplasmic ) domain of the receptor .

Pretreatment ( or up to 15 minutes post-treatment ) relative to TNFa with the antioxidant dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ( 2 % [ vol/voll ) blocks 80 % of NF- « B-dependent transcription .
Surprisingly , however , DMSO has no effect on inducible Rel A binding .
Similar selective effects on NF-xB transcription are seen with the unrelated antioxidants , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) and vitamin C. These data indicate that TNFa induces a delayed ROS-dependent signalling pathway that is required for NF-kB transcriptional activation and is separable from that required for its nuclear translocation .
Further definition of this pathway will yield new insights into inflammation initiated by TNFa : signalling .

signal transducing proteins , termed TNF receptor death domain protein ( TRADD ) , and TRADD-associated factors ( TRAFs ) apparently control the activity of intracellular serine-threonine kinase cascades and protease activation . ''
In addition , it has been appreciated that TNF receptor activation also results in the generation of putative second messenger molecules including ceramide , 1,2-diacylglycerol , arachidonic acid , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
IL-8 is an important paracrine mediator of inflammation of the CXC chemokine family that amplifies inflammatory signals by demargination , activation , and chemotaxis of polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes . '' ''
Encoded by a highly inducible gene , TNFa is a potent inducer of IL-8 secretion in a variety of cell types through a transcriptional mechanism primarily regulated by nuclear factor-kB ( NF-kB ) . > '' !
NF-KB is a heterodimeric protein composed of the transactivating subunit ( Rel A ) associated with the DNA binding subunit sequestered in a latent cytoplasmic form by association with inhibitor .
In response to cytokine stimulation , Rel A-IxBa dissociates and IxBa is proteolyzed , allowing the liberated cytoplasmic NF-kB to be translocated into the nucleus , where it binds to genomic targets and initiates transcription . ''
ROS are ubiquitous highly diffusable and reactive molecules produced as a result of reduction of molecular oxygen , and include species such as hydrogen peroxide , superoxide anion , and hydroxyl radical . ''
Recently , a role of ROS in cellular responses to growth factor signalling has been described for platelet-derived growth factor ' '' and basic fibroblast-derived growth factor . '' ''
In these examples , hormone receptor-activated ROS were involved in proliferative and programmed cell death .
The contribution of ROS as second messenger molecules in TNFa signalling is controversial .
Although others have shown that extracellular oxidants ( H ; O ; ) and enzymatic oxidative stress-inducing systems are capable of activating IL-8 secre-tion , '' '' these systems may be artifactual because they may not reproduce hormone receptor-induced ROS production in magnitude , kinetics , or ROS concentrations in proper subcellular compartments .

ROS PATHWAY IN NF-kB TRANSCRIPTION inducible expression of IL-8 in the histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 .
U937 cells share phenotypic ( IgG receptor expression and inducible differentiation ) and functional ( inducible cytokine expression ) features with normal monocytes .
'* '' '' We show that TNFa is a potent and rapid inducer of IL-8 protein secretion and gene expression .
This effect is , in part , through enhanced transcription mediated through a single inducible cis regulatory element that binds to the inducible NF- « B transcription factor .
In parallel , TNFa induces ROS generation as measured by the specific fluorescent 2',7'dichlorofluescein oxidation assay . '' ''
Pretreatment of U937 cells with the antioxidant dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) blocks inducible ROS generation and NF-xB transcriptional activity .
Surprisingly , the effect of DMSO occurs without altering either NF-KB nuclear abundance or DNA-binding activity .
The unrelated antioxidants , vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , also selectively inhibit NE- « B transcriptional activity without detectable effects on NE- « B binding .
These data indicate that an antioxidant pathway is required for NF- « B transcriptional activity that is separate and independent of signals coupled to nuclear translocation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials .
- Recombinant human TNFa was obtained from Calbio-chem ( San Diego , CA ) .
DMSO , NAC , vitamin C , and vitamin E were purchased from Sigma ( St Louis , MO ) .
N- [ 2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'- [ 2-ethanesulfonic acid ] ( HEPES ) , sodium lauryl sulfate ( SDS ) , sodium chloride , sodium citrate , and ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid ( EDTA ) were from Fischer Scientific ( Pittsburgh , PA ) .
Dichlorofluores-cein diacetate ( DCF-DA ) was obtained from Molecular Probes ( Eu-gene , OR ) .
Cell culture and treatment .
| U937 human histiocytoma lymphoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ; Rockville , MD ) and grown as a suspension in RPMI medium containing 10 % ( vol/vol ) fetal bovine serum , 10 mmol/L glutamine , 100 IU/mL penicillin , and 100 pg/mL streptomycin ( GIBCO , Gaithersburg , MD ) in an atmosphere of 5 % CO ; , at 37°C .
TNFa was added to the medium at a final concentration of 20 ng/mL , unless otherwise stated .
For antioxidant treatments , cells were pretreated either with indicated concentrations of DMSO ( 1 hour before TNFa , unless otherwise indicated ) , or NAC ( 7.5 mmol/L , 2 hours before TNFa ) , or with vitamin C ( 4 mmol/L , 2 hours before TNFa ) .
Assesment of intracellular ROS generation .
U937 cells were pre-loaded with 5 umol/L DCF-DA in fully supplied culture medium containing 20 mmol/L HEPES , pH 7.4 for 20 minutes at 37°C .
The cells were washed by centrifugation at 200g and resuspended in serum-containing fresh medium buffered in 20 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.4 .
After stimulation with TNFa , the cells were placed in a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer ( excitation 485 nm ; emission 530 nm ; Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) to quantitate oxidation into fluorescent DCF ( an indicator of the intracellular ROS production '' '' ) .
A minimum of 10,000 cells was analyzed and the results expressed as fluorescence mean + standard deviation ( SD ) of n = 3 independent experiments .
IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
_ Immunoteac-tive IL-8 was quantitated in cell culture supernatants by a double-antibody ELISA kit using recombinant IL-8 as a standard ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) following the manufacturer 's protocol .
This assay has a sensitivity of detection of 200 pg/mL .
Northern blot analysis .
Total RNA was extracted from control , TNFa-treated , or antioxidant plus TNFo : -treated cells by the RNAzol kit ( Teltest , Friendswood , TX ) and RNA abundance quantitated spectro-photometrically .
Twenty micrograms of RNA was fractionated on a 1.2 % agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon-reinforced nitrocellulose membrane ( MSI , Westboro , MA ) .
The RNA was then 1879 hybridized using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -generated body-labeled cDNA probe for IL-8 , '' followed by an 188 rRNA-cDNA probe using previously reported conditions . '' ''
Blots were washed in 5 % SDS , 1 X sodium chloride sodium citrate ( SSC ) buffer at 50°C 3 times , 15 minutes each , and quantitated by exposure to a Molecular Dynamics ( Sunnyvale , CA ) Phosphorimager cassette .
After quantitation , the blots were exposed to a Kodak XARS5 film ( Rochester , NY ) .
Plasmid construction and transient transfections .
5 '' deletion constructs of the human IL-8 ( hIL-8 ) promoter® '' were produced using the PCR with -1498/+44 hIL-8/Luc reporter plasmid® as a template and a downstream oligonucleotide hybridizing +86 to +55 '' of the luciferase ( LUC ) cDNA . ?
Upstream primers were used to produce 5 ' deletions at nucleotide -162 , -132 , -99 , and -54 by incorporating a unique Bam H1 restriction site immediately upstream .
The PCR products were restricted with Bam H1 and Hind III , gel purified , and subcloned into the poLUC reporter vector . ''
Site-directed mutagenesis of the NF-B site in the context of -162/+-44 hIL-8 were introduced using the technique of PCR `` SOEING '' ® with the mutagenic primers ( mutations underlined ) : 5'-TTCATTATGTCAGATTAAATTAAACGATTT-3 ' and 5-TTGCA-AATCGTTTAATTTAATCTGACAATA-3 ' .
For the NF-IL-6 binding site-mutation , the primers 5'-GCCATCAGCTACGAGTCGTG-GAATTTCCTCTGA-3 ' and 5'-GAAATTCCACGACTCGTAGCT-GATGGCCCATCC-3 ' were used .
For the activator protein ( AP ) -1 binding site mutation , the primers GCCCTGA-3 ' and were used .

Plasmids for use in transfection were purified by ion exchange ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , CA ) and sequenced to verify authenticity .
Transient transfections were performed in 10 '' logarithmically growing U937 cells using a mixture of 60 ug diethylaminoethyl-dextran with 45 ug of hIL-8/LUC reporter and 9 ug of SV40/alkaline phosphatase-internal control plasmid .
After 20 minutes at room temperature , the cells were centrifuged ( at 300xg ) , resuspended in fresh culture medium , and distributed into 9 60-mm plates , and returned to the incubator .
Cells were treated 16 hours after transfection .
Six hours after treatment , cells were harvested , cytoplasmic lysates prepared , and luciferase activity measured . ''
As an internal control for transfection efficiency , alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in 50 ug cell lysate by the dephosphorylation of alkaline phosphatase substrate ( Sigma ) in DEA buffer ( 1 mol/L Diethanolamine , pH 9.85 , 0.28 mol/L NaCl , 0.5 mol/L MgC ] ; ) .

RESULTS Induction of the IL-8 gene expression by TNFa .
The mechanism for TNFe-induced IL-8 expression was studied in U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells .

ROS PATHWAY IN NF-kB TRANSCRIPTION stimulated by maximal doses of TNFa and changes in IL-8 mRNA detected by Northern blot assay at various times of stimulation ( Fig 1A ) .
TNFa induced the rapid appearance of a 1.8-kb transcript , detectable at 10-fold ( relative to control ) with 30 minutes and peaked at a ~50-fold induction between 60 to 180 minutes .
At later times , IL-8 expression began to fall , indicating the effect of TNFa was rapid , but transient ( not shown ) .
The dose-response relationship of IL-8 mRNA was next investigated .
At TNFa concentrations between 0.0064 ng/mL to 0.8 ng/mL , IL-8 gene expression was strongly induced in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig 1B ) .
Further increasing the dose of TNFa produced a flat dose-response curve ( not shown ) , indicating receptor saturation .
To determine whether IL-8 was secreted in parallel to the changes in IL-8 gene expression , IL-8 protein was assayed in U937 cell culture supernatants ( Fig 1C ) .

The delay relative to mRNA accumulation presumably reflects the time required for mRNA translation and protein secretion .
To test whether transcription was a component of IL-8 gene induction by TNFa , the reporter gene luciferase under the control of various lengths of IL-8 promoter '' was transfected into U937 cells .
TNFa : stimulation resulted in a strong induction of the native -1498 nucleotide ( nt ) IL-8 promoter-mediated luciferase activity ( Fig 2A ) .
5 deletion from -1498 to -162 nt resulted in no significant change in either basal or inducible luciferase activity .
However , deletion from-162 to -99 nt reduced the basal and fold induction by approximately 2-fold ( 47-fold became 19-fold ) .
Stimulation of -54 hIL-8/LUC showed it to be completely inert to TNFa .
These data indicate that TNFa induction of the IL-8 promoter requires 2 domains , the first between -162 to -99 and the second between -99 to -54 for full inducibility .
The IL-8 gene promoter contains 3 binding sites for known transcription factors : ( 1 ) AP-1 , a protein binding between -127 and -119 nt ; ( 2 ) NF-IL6 , a protein that binds between -94 and -81 nt ; and ( 3 ) NF-KB , a protein that binds between -80 and -70 nt . ' ''
We next tested the individual role for each of these sites by producing site-directed mutations in the context of the -162 hIL-8 promoter .
As shown in Fig 2B , mutation of the NE- « B site completely abolished TNFo-inducible transcription .
Mutation of the AP-1 site reduced induction by ~2-fold ( from 45-fold to 20-fold ) , whereas mutation of the NF-IL6 site was silent .
These data indicate that although the AP-1 site participates in basal and TNFa-inducible activity of the IL-8 promoter , only the NF-KB site is absolutely required .
To determine whether these sites are independently TNFa-inducible , reporter genes containing multimers of either the AP-1 , NF-kB , or NE-IL6 elements ligated upstream of an inert TATA box were transfected into U937 and stimulated with TNFa ( Fig 2C ) .
The multimer was 32-fold inducible by TNF , whereas other sites were not significantly TNF-inducible .
Although the AP-1 site was not TNFa-inducible , it was strongly induced by the diacylglycerol agonist , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .
We conclude that the NF-KB site is the only TNFo-inducible promoter element in the IL-8 promoter , whose presence is both necessary and sufficient for the TNFa transcription .

1882 TNFa induces NF- « B binding and IxBa proteolysis .
One mechanism for NF-kB activation is enhanced nuclear DNA binding of the Rel A transactivator subunit .
To verify this mechanism , sucrose cushion-purified nuclear extracts from TNFa-stimulated U937 cells were assayed for NF- « B binding in EMSA ( Fig 3A ) .
In control extracts , a constitutive binding activity ( C3 ) was observed .
Within 5 minutes stimulation , 2 additional closely comigrating complexes ( C1 and C2 ) were induced to bind that apparently peaked at 30 minutes .
Sequence specificity of C1 , 2 , and 3 complexes is seen by ability of 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type , but not site mutation , of the NF-kB contact points '' '' to compete for their binding ( Fig 3A ) .
Inducible complexes C1 and C2 contain the Rel A transactivating subunit as indicated by ability of Rel A antibody , but not preimmune sera , to selectively attenuate their binding ( Fig 3B ) .
We and others have shown that Rel A is tethered in the cytoplasm by association with IkBa inhibitor , which must be degraded to release Rel A into the nucleus . ''
Western immunoblot of cytoplasmic extracts from control and treated U937 cells was performed to determine changes in steady state IxBa protein ( Fig 3C ) .
TNFa induced a rapid proteolysis of IxBa at 5 minutes , followed by its reappearance ( due to resynthesis ) at 60 minutes .
This data indicates NP- « B is activated by TNFa in a conventional pathway requiring IxBa proteolysis .
TNFa induces ROS formation .
- The precise role of ROS in TNFa signaling is controversial . ''
Because extracellular oxidants can activate NF- « B binding in some cell lines and high concentrations of antioxidants block TNFa-induced NF-kB activation , NF-kB is considered to be an ROS-responsive transcription factor .
`` `` '' > 2 '' 28 It is , however , unclear whether these pharmacological studies are relevant to hormone-induced cell signaling .
To determine whether TNFa-induced ROS in U937 , we monitored ROS formation by oxidation of DCF , a standard indicator of intracellular oxidation . ''
TNFa stimulation induced a highly reproducible and significant change in DCF fluorescence , first detectable between 5 and 8 minutes ( Fig 4 ) .
The plateau in ROS formation was transient , peaking at 2-fold increase in mean fluorescence intensity at 15 minutes , and declined thereafter , even in the continuous presence of hormone .
Various concentrations of antioxidants were used in preliminary studies to identify the smallest concentrations that Fig 3 .

Mean fluorescence intensity , each point representing 10+ cells , is plotted as a function of time .
The error bars represent SD from 3 independent experiments .
Statistical analysis of the TNFa-only stimulated cells ( at 12 , 15 , and 18 minutes ) versus unstimulated or versus TNFa plus antioxidant , yields P < .0001 .
Antioxidants block IL-8 gene expression .
- Identification of the minimum effective dose of antioxidants enabled us to test whether TNFa .
stimulation of IL-8 gene expression is mediated by ROS .
To determine whether antioxidants interfere with TNFa-induced IL-8 expression , IL-8 protein secretion from DMSO-pretreated cells was measured by ELISA .
The presence of 2 % DMSO significantly interfered with over 90 % of inducible IL-8 secretion without affecting cell viability or cell number ( Fig 5A ) .
Northern blot analysis to assay changes in endogenous IL-8 expression was next performed in U937 cells stimulated in the presence of increasing concentrations of DMSO .
Compared with TNFa alone , treatment with 0.4 % DMSO inhibited IL-8 mRNA induction by 35 % and treatment with 2 % DMSO Fig 5 .
TNFa stimulation of IL-8 is dependent on intracellular oxidation .
( A ) Inducible IL-8 protein secretion is sensitive to DMSO .
Triplicate cultures of U937 cultures were untreated ( control ) or stimulated with 20 ng/mL TNFa in the absence or presence of 2 % ( vol/vol ) DMSO .
At indicated times , cell culture supernatants were harvested and immunoreactive IL-8 determined by ELISA .

This apparently was not a nonspecific effect because steady state levels of 188 RNA and total cell number were unchanged ( not shown ) .
To determine whether the antioxidant effect influenced IL-8 gene expression at the transcriptional level , the same experiment was conducted in U937 cells transiently transfected with the -162 hIL-8/LUC reporter gene .
A similar inhibition was seen ; treatment with 0.4 % DMSO inhibited TNFo-inducible IL-8 induction by 40 % , and treatment with 2 % DMSO inhibited IL-8 induction by 90 % ( Fig 5C ) .
These data indicate the antioxidant effect occurs by interference of TNFa-inducible transcription .

1884 Identification of antioxidant sensitive site on the IL-8 promoter .
_ The effect of DMSO on transcription could be through interference of the AP-1 or NF-kB activities .
Transient transfections of hIL-8/LUC 5 ' deletions were next tested to localize the DMSO effect .
All of the 5 ' deletions that were TNFa inducible , including the -99 hIL-8/LUC ( that contains only the NF- « B site ) , were potently inhibited by DMSO ( over 90 % ) and therefore antioxidant sensitive ( Fig 6A ) .
Site mutations of NF-kB , AP-1 , and NF-IL6 were similarly tested ( Fig 6B ) .
All mutations containing the NF-kB site were inhibited more than 80 % , while mutation at the NF-KB site abolished both inducibility by TNFa and sensitivity to DMSO .
Finally , multimers of each element were tested ( Fig 6C ) .
No significant inhibition of reporter gene activity driven by NP-IL6 or AP-1 was seen ; only the NF- « B site was inhibited by treatment with 2 % DMSO ( 90 % inhibition ) .
Taken together , these data indicate antioxidant effect is predominantly mediated by interference with NF-kB transcriptional activity .
We tested whether TNFa-inducible proteolysis of IxBa is affected by antioxidant concentrations effective in our experiments .
Western immunoblots were performed to measure changes in IxBa abundance in DMSO-pretreated cells at various doses of TNFa ( Fig 7A ) .
Surprisingly , IBa was rapidly proteolyzed equivalently in the DMSO-pretreated cells .
This indicated that DMSO effect was apparently not mediated by influencing NF-kB translocation .
To further show this , sucrose cushion-purified nuclear extracts were assayed for steady state changes in Rel A by Western immunoblot assay ( Fig 7B ) .
Untreated nuclei contain very low levels of Rel A , whereas nuclear Rel A abundance is strongly induced after TNF-treatment ; these data indicate pretreatment with 2 % DMSO does not change nuclear Rel A abundance .
Activation of NF-kB DNA binding activity has been reported to be antioxidant-sensitive in some cell systems . '' ''
To determine whether DMSO treatment interfered with Rel A binding , sucrose cushion purified nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA ( Fig 7C ) .
Under EMSA conditions shown , a linear relationship was observed between TNFa dose ( up to 20 Fig 6 .

Also , a linear relationship of C1/C2 binding was observed as a function of input nuclear proteins ( cf , lanes 7 , 6 , and 4 ) .
However , pretreatment with DMSO had no detectable influence on the magnitude of inducible NF-kB DNA binding .
These data indicate that DMSO influenced NF- « B-dependent transcription without influencing its DNA binding .
To verify this surprising result , transfection studies were conducted to determine the transcriptional dose-response relationship ( as for the DNA binding experiment in Fig 7C ) .

To further exclude the potential possibility that DMSO interfered with selective recruitment of Rel A transactivator on the NF-KB site that might not be detected in EMSA , we performed a 2-step microaffinity isolation/ Western immunoblot .
In this assay , biotinylated NF-kB binding site is used to pull down NF-kB proteins that are subsequently detected by Western .
We have previously shown that this assay detects NF-kB members in a sequence-specific fashion . ''
As shown in Fig 7E , TNFa strongly induces 65-kD Rel A binding ; the abundance of Rel A is not influenced by pretreatment with 2 % DMSO .

Antioxidant inhibition of IL-8 expression occurs after IxBa proteolysis .
After TNFa treatment , IxBa proteolysis was complete within 5 minutes ( Fig 3C ) , whereas ROS production was delayed 8 to 15 minutes ( Fig 4 ) .
This suggests that temporally , the requirement for ROS production in NF- « kB-activated IL-8 transcription may be after NF-KB translocates .
If so , posttreatment with DMSO ( relative to TNF stimulation ) would still interfere with IL-8 gene expression .

These data strongly argue that the antioxidant sensitive pathway is separate and distinct from NF- « B translocation .
Antioxidants NAC and vitamin C also selectively affect NF-KB transcription .
- To exclude nonspecific effects of DMSO , other chemically unrelated antioxidants NAC and vitamin C were tested for ability to interfere with TNFa-inducible NF- « B transcriptional activity .
Transient transfection assays using the NF- « B multimer LUC reporter indicated that doses of antioxidants at concentrations that block ROS formation ( 7.5 mmol/L NAC , 4 mmol/L vitamin C , see Fig 4 ) similarly significantly block NF- « xB-dependent transcription ( 60 % by NAC , 85 % by vitamin C ) .
These antioxidant effects are independent from changes in NF- « B binding as measured in EMSA ( not shown ) .
Taken together , these data indicate the requirement of an ROS-dependent activation pathway of NFP- « B that is distinct from the nuclear translocation pathway responsible for inducible DNA-binding .
DISCUSSION In a variety of pathophysiological states initiated by infectious or inflammatory agents , TNFa secretion is responsible for activating the cytokine cascade required for appropriate cellular responses in the target tissue .
An important cellular target of TNFa is the circulating monocyte , wherein TNFa induces a program of phenotypic changes required for phagocytosis and by inducing the secretion of other inflammatory mediators , allowing for the recruitment of neutrophils into the target tissue .
Specifically , production of IL-8 allows for the activation , demargination , and chemotaxis of neutrophils into the inflamed tissue .
This study provides additional mechanistic information to the observations of others where TNFa has been shown to induce IL-8 secretion in whole blood , the majority of which is derived from monocytes .
We observe here that TNFa activates IL-8 expression through the participation of 2 regulatory factors .
Although both AP-1 and NF-KB are required for maximal IL-8 gene expression , only NE-B is truly TNFa inducible .
In unstimulated cells , NF-kB is maintained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm through association with the IB inhibitors .
Dissociation of Rel A from IB is a prerequisite for Rel A cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation . '' ''
This is accomplished through a 2-step mechanism , where first the inhibitor is phosphorylated at serine residues 32 and 36 by the ubiquitous IB kinase , IKK , '' and second the phospho-IxBa is polyubiquitinated and proteolyzed through the 26S proteasome . ''
Our data shows that proteolysis is a consequence of TNFa .
stimulation in U937 cells and occurs coincidentally with Rel A translocation .
The Rel A NE- « B subunit is the major TNFa-inducible transactivator of the IL-8 promoter in a variety of cell types , including epithe-lial , '' fibrosarcoma , ' '' and histiocytic cells ( this study ) .
Consistent with these findings , in U937 cells , our antibody interference assays indicate that Rel A is largely responsible for the strongly inducible C1 and C2 complexes ( Fig 3A ) , and microaffinity isolation/Western immunoblot assays indicate Rel A binding is strongly induced after TNFa : treatment ( Fig 7B ) .
Although Rel A translocation has been thought to be necessary and sufficient for transcriptional activation of IL-8 , our observations show that pretreatment with antioxidants dissociates the 2 processes ( of translocation and transcriptional activa-tion ) .
Our conclusions are based on the lack of antioxidant effect on inducible changes in steady state Rel A abundance in the nuclear compartment ( by Western blot ) and the measurement of Rel A binding in microaffinity capture and EMSA assays ( Fig 7 ) .
It is important to highlight that changes in Rel A binding detected by EMSA correlate linearly with NF-KB From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

Nuclei were isolated and subjected to EMSA analysis with a radiolabeled NF-xB site .
Only bound complexes are show n. transcription over the TNFa dose-response curve ( Fig 7 ) .
In this experiment , 0.032 ng/mL TNFa activates the NF- « B-dependent promoter 7-fold weaker than 20 ng/mL and yields a corresponding 7-fold weaker signal in EMSA analysis .
In sharp contrast , 2 % ( vol/vol ) -DMSO pretreatment reduces inducible promoter activity by 8-fold ; this would be expected to reduce NF-kB binding by a similar extent ( 7-fold to 8-fold ) .
However , because no such reduction in NF- « B is observed , we interpret the antioxidant effect is clearly independent of changes in Rel A DNA binding activity .
Our study indicates that ROS production is a necessary prerequisite for IL-8 production by TNFa through a require « UEHBE ment for the transcriptional function of NF-kB .
TNFa induces ROS production in numerous independent assays , including depletion of antioxidant pools , '' elicitation of Electron Paramag-netic Resonance-detectable 2,2,6,6 , -tetramethyl-1-piperidine-n-oxyl decay , '' by spin trap-ping , '' '' thiobarbituric acid-detectable lipid peroxidation , '' '' and DCF oxidation ( this study ) .
Importantly , our data indicates that TNFa induces IxBa proteolysis and ROS production in U937 cells with discrete kinetics .
In these cells , IxBa proteolysis , Rel A translocation , and NF-kB binding occur unmeasurably rapidly ( within 5 minutes ) ; however , the kinetics of ROS production are delayed , being first detectable at 8 minutes , with a peak From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

1888 15 minutes after stimulation .
Although this apparent delay may be the consequence of the kinetics of DCF oxidation , this explanation is unlikely for 2 reasons .
First , DCF oxidation indicates within seconds an immediate and steep increase in oxidant levels in response to H ; 0 , -treatment ( data not shown and Bass et al '' '' ) , which shows that the oxidation lag in response to TNFa : is not a detection artifact .
Second , addition of antioxidant ( up to ) 15 minutes after TNFa administration still blocks inducible IL-8 transcription ( Fig 8 ) .
These observations strongly argue that the ROS transcriptional activation pathway is distinct ( temporally and mechanistically ) from that involved in NF-B translocation .
Although it is widely appreciated that the transcription factor , NF- « B , is activated by pharmacologic doses of oxidants , '' '' the administration of extracellular oxidants may not faithfully reproduce the kinetics , magnitude , or subcellular compartmen-talization of ROS produced as a consequence of hormone receptor activation .
For example , addition of extracellular H ; 0 ; to Jurkat T cells , HeLa cervical carcinoma , L6 skeletal muscle , and other cells is sufficient to induce NF-kB translocation. ? ''
However , the degree of intracellular oxidation required for NF-KB translocation by extracellular H ; 0 ; is at least an order of magnitude more than that produced by TNFa ( data not shown ; Schmid et al '' '' ) ; these results , therefore , are of uncertain relevance to hormone-induced signaling .
Conversely , other studies have shown that antioxidants inhibit inducible NF- « B binding .
In murine macrophage cells , 1 % DMSO inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced NF- « B translocation . '' ''
In another study , almost complete inhibition of TNFa-induced Rel A translocation was produced with 10 mmol/L NAC in synovial fibroblasts . ''
Previously reported studies of antioxidant inhibition of stimulus-dependent NF-kB translocation have been conducted using 20 mmol/L NAC ( or higher ) and 100 umol/L pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate .
' '' '' '' 2 '' In these studies , antioxidant pretreatment dramatically decreased PMA- , TNFa-or H ; , O ; -induced NF-kB binding in several cell types , including Jurkat T cells , Ltk-mouse fibroblasts , 702/3 mouse pre B cells .
The antioxidant effect on NF- « B translocation , therefore , appears to be cell-type-dependent and stimulus-dependent .
As a specific example , NAC concentrations that inhibited TNFa-induced NF- « B binding in Jurkat T cells fail to inhibit it in endothelial cells . ''
Also , although IL-1 caused ROS formation and antioxidant-sensitive NF-KB translocation in 702/3 lymphoid cells , in ovarian carcinoma ( OVCAR-3 ) epithelial cells , IL-1B failed to cause detectable ROS formation and activates NF- « B translocation in antioxidant-insensitive manner .
* ' These studies indicate the existence of ROS-dependent pathway ( s ) for NF-kB translocation are found in a cell-type restricted manner .
Our observations indicate the presence of an antioxidant-sensitive signalling pathway in U937 cells ; this pathway is sensitive to low doses of antioxidants that inhibit inducible , but not constitutive , ROS production and functions at a level independently of translocation .
Along with this study , several lines of evidence are consistent with the existence of an independent NF-KB activating pathway .
For example , translocation of NF- « B has been shown insufficient for IL-1B or TNFa-induced NF-kB-dependent transcription in airway epithelial cells.4 In that study , NF-kB-dependent transcription , but not translocation , was blocked by pretreatment with protein kinase inhibitors of the p38 and MAP kinases .
However , the relationship of the MAP kinase cascade to ROS production was unexplored and will require further investiga- VLAHOPOULOS ET AL tion .
In another study , DMSO interfered with LPS-induced liver cytokine expression through a mechanism that could not be readily explained by the slight attenuation DMSO caused on NE- « B translocation . ''
We speculate that the ROS signalling pathway could affect posttranslational modification of Rel A , the recruitment of coactivators to the IL-8 promoter , or the assembly of an NF-KB driven preinitiation complex . ''
One inducible event that is clearly distinct from the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of Rel A is the phosphorylation of Rel A in response to TNFa , ** LPS , * and PMA . ''
Intriguingly , LPS-induced phosphorylation of Rel A was completely blocked by an antioxidant . ''
Further definition of this pathway will be required experimentally .
In U937 , ROS may be important general second messenger signals for cytokine production .
Treatment with the potent NE- « B activating agent , LPS , also increases intracellular ROS production . '' ''
At low concentrations , the antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbonate ( PDTC ) and NAC completely blocked LPS-inducible ROS formation , without significant inhibition of NF- « B binding ( less than 20 % ) .4 '' The oxidant pathway may be mediating transcriptional activation in several receptor-mediated pathways that activate NF-KB .
It will be interesting to compare the requirement of other NF-KB activating cytokines on ROS signalling .
Antioxidants have been shown effective in reducing IL-8 secretion and the severity of septic shock '' * and airway inflam-mation '' in humans .
Identification of the component of signal transduction that is sensitive to antioxidants will open the door to more selective treatment of inflammatory disorders without occurrence of side effects that would arise from the complete deactivation of the TNFa : signaling cascade .
