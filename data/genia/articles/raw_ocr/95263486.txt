The protein products of this gene contain the basic-helix-loop-helix motif characteristic of a large family of transcription factors that bind to the canonical DNA sequence CANNTG as protein heterodimers .
TAL1 expression by erythroid cells in vivo and in chemical-in-duced erythroleukemia cell lines in vitro suggested the gene might regulate aspects of erythroid differentiation .
Since the terminal events of erythropoiesis are controlled by the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin ( Epo ) , we investigated whether the expression or activity of the TALLI gene and its protein products were affected by Epo in splenic erythroblasts from mice infected with an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus ( FVA cells ) .
Epo elicited a rapid , dose-related increase in TALL mRNA by increasing transcription of the gene and stabilizing one of its mRNAs .
An Epo-inducible TAL1 DNA binding activity was identified in FVA cell nuclear extracts that subsequently decayed despite accumulating mRNA and protein .
Induction of DNA binding activity was associated temporally with Epo-induced phosphorylation of nuclear TALl protein .
These results indicate that Epo acts at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels on the TAL 1 locus in Friend virus-induced erythroblasts and establish a link between Epo signaling mechanisms and a member of a family of transcription factors involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages .
The TAL1 ( also known as SCL and TCLS5 ) gene was originally identified through its location at a chromosome break-point in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( 1-3 ) .
Although involved in reciprocal translocations with the T-cell receptor-a/8 and , in one case , -8 locus ( 4 ) , the gene is more frequently affected by interstitial deletions upstream of its coding region which result in the head-to-tail fusion of the TAL1 and SIL ( for SCL interrupting locus ) genes ( 5-7 ) .

Overall , deregulated TAL 7 expression may occur in as many as 30 % of individuals with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia , making this the most frequent molecular lesion recognized in this disorder .
The protein products of the TAL ] gene contain a dimerization motif characteristic of a large family of genes involved in the regulation of cell fate ( 10 , 11 ) .
This conserved domain was predicted to adopt a helix-loop-helix ( HLH ) conformation in which two amphipathic helices are separated by a less structured loop region of varying length ( 12 ) .
The HLH motif promotes the formation of protein hetero- and homodimers , while an adjacent region enriched in basic amino acids and found in many of the proteins of this class mediates sequence-specific DNA binding ( 13-15 ) .
The basic domain-HLH ( bHLH ) proteins , including TAL1 ( 16 , 17 ) , bind as dimers to a canonical sequence CANNTG termed the E-box and function as transcriptional regulators .
Distinct subgroups of HLH genes can be recognized on the basis of sequence homology , pattern of expression , and function .
Four bHLH proteins , of which MyoD is the prototype , are expressed in developing muscle and share the ability to induce myogenic differentiation when expressed in certain cell lines ( 18 , 19 ) .
The three genes TAL1 , TAL2 , and LYL-1 show greater than 80 % identity within their basic and HLH domains and share an additional similarity in that each was isolated as a result of its involvement in a human leukemia ( 8 ) .
The recently identified bHLH-EC2 gene also shows considerable sequence homology to and overlaps with TAL ] in its expression ( 20 ) .
TAL1 RNA has been detected in megakaryocytic , erythroid , and mast cell lines ( 21-23 ) and by in situ hybridization in human megakaryocytes , erythroblasts , and basophilic granulocytes ( 24 ) .
Endothelial cells ( 25 ) and neurons ( 23 ) have also been found to express TAL1 RNA and protein , and studies of its expression during embryogenesis suggest the gene may have actions in vascular , neural , and hematopoietic development ( 26 ) .
Considerable evidence suggests that TAL I regulates aspects of erythroid differentiation .
TALI RNA and protein are expressed in embryonic and adult erythroid progenitors ( 21 , 23 , 26 ) and in murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cell lines , increasing significantly with hexamethylene bisacetamide- or Me , SO-in-duced differentiation ( 21 , 22 , 27 ) .
Furthermore , the enforced expression of TALI promotes the differentiation of MEL lines even in the absence of chemical inducer , while antisense-me-diated inhibition of TALI expression blocks Me , SO- and hexa- * The abbreviations used are : HLH , helix-loop-helix ; bHLH , basic domain helix-loop-helix ; MEL , murine erythroleukemia ; Epo , erythropoie-tin ; FVA , anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus ; kb , kilobase ( s ) ; EMSA , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ; EpoR , erythropoietin receptor .

Since the terminal events of erythropoiesis are controlled by the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin ( Epo ) , these observations suggested that the expression of the TAL 1 gene or the activity of its protein products might be regulated by this growth factor .
To analyze the effects of Epo on TALI mRNA and protein expression we have used erythroblasts purified from the spleens of mice infected with an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus ( FVA cells ) .
In contrast to established MEL lines , these cells show an absolute dependence on Epo for their initial survival in culture and undergo apoptosis if the growth factor is withheld ( 28 ) .
In the presence of Epo , FVA cells complete a full program of differentiation over a period of 48-60 h , including nuclear extrusion with the formation of reticulocytes ( 29 ) .
This cell system has been extensively characterized with regard to Epo 's effects on hemoglobin synthesis ( 30 ) , cytoskeletal maturation ( 31 ) , and programmed cell death ( 28 ) , and represents an excellent model of normal erythroid differentiation .
Our experiments indicate that sequential activating and inhibitory influ-ences , operating at both transcriptional and post-transcrip-tional levels , act on the TALI locus in Epo-stimulated erythroblasts .
Furthermore , they establish a link between signaling by this hematopoietic growth factor and a family of transcription factors many of whose members have been shown to specify cell fate .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture-CD , F , mice of 8-12 weeks of age were given 10° spleen focus-forming units of an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus by tail vein injection .
The animals were sacrificed 2 weeks later and erythroblasts purified from spleen cell suspensions by sedimentation at unit gravity through a linear gradient of 1 to 2 % bovine serum albumin as described ( 29 ) .
FVA-induced erythroblasts were cultured in Iscove 's modified Dulbecco 's medium supplemented with 30 % fetal calf serum , 1 % deionized bovine serum albumin , and 0.1 mM « -thioglycerol with the indicated concentration of recombinant human Epo ( Ortho ) .
Cells were collected at the indicated times of culture and washed once with chilled phosphate-buffered saline prior to use .
Northern Blot Analysis-Total cellular RNA was isolated from erythroblasts using a single step guanidine thiocyanate/phenol method ( RNAzol ; BicTecx ) ( 32 ) .
RNA samples ( 10 ug ) were fractionated by electrophoresis in 0.8 % agarose gels containing 0.66 M formaldehyde and transferred by capillary action to nylon membranes ( Nytran ; Schleicher and Schuell ) .
Baked membranes were prehybridized for 4-6 h at 42 °C in 50 % formamide , 5 x SSC ( 1 x = 0.15 m NaCl , 0.015 m sodium citrate ) , 1 X Denhardt 's solution ( 0.02 % Ficoll , 0.02 % polyvi-nylpyrrolidone , 0.02 % bovine serum albumin ) , 0.5 % SDS , 10 % dextran sulfate , and 100 pg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA .
Blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 1.5 X 10° cpm/ml radiolabeled probe in the same buffer and washed with 2 x SSC for 20 min at room temperature , 2 x SSC , 0.5 % SDS for 1 h at 65 °C , and 0.1 x SSC for 30 min at 65 °C .
Following washing , blots were exposed to film and the resulting autoradiograms analyzed by laser scanning densitometry ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. ) .
RNA loading was normalized to 28 S ribosomal RNA using a photographic negative of the ethidium bromide-stained gel as described ( 33 ) Data from four independent experiments were used in determining the mean RNA level +8.E .
for both the 5.0- and 3.7-kb TALZ mRNAs as a function of time following Epo addition .
Differences in mean RNA levels in Epo-treated versus Epo-deprived cells were analyzed by a two-tailed ?
test .
A 535-base pair Banl/Xbal restriction fragment of the mouse TALLI cDNA was used as probe .
This region does not contain the conserved basic and HLH domains to avoid potential cross-hybridization to related HLH sequences .
The GATA-1 probe was an XAo ! /Xhol restriction fragment of plasmid pXM-GF-1 containing the full coding sequence of murine GATA-1 ( 34 ) , the Id1 probe was a BamHUEcoRI restriction fragment of plasmid pMH18AR containing bases 5-927 of murine Id1 sequence ( 35 ) , and the LYL-1 probe was a polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA containing bases -28-422 of murine LYL-I sequence ( 22 ) .
All probes were labeled with by random primer extension ( 36 ) .
Nuclear Run-off Analysis-Nuclei were isolated from FVA-induced erythroblasts at the indicated times using a Dounce homogenizer as described previously ( 30 ) and frozen overnight at -70 °C in a buffer Erythropoietin and TAL1/SCL Expression containing 40 % glycerol , 5 mm MgCl , , 0.1 mm EDTA , and 50 mM Tris , pH 8.0 .
In vitro transcription was carried out as described ( 37 ) using 5 xX 10 '' nuclei and 250 Ci of [ a-*°P ] JUTP per reaction for 30 min at 30 °C .
Briefly , the resulting radiolabeled RNA was treated with DNase I and proteinase K , extracted with phenol and chloroform , precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and ethanol , and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbon-ate-treated water .
Nitrocellulose filters containing the indicated probes immobilized by baking were prehybridized for at least 4 h at 42 °C in 50 % formamide , 5 x SSC , 10 x Denhardt 's solution , 0.1 % SDS , 0.05 mg/ml poly ( A ) , and 0.25 mg/m ] herring sperm DNA and then incubated in the same buffer containing radiolabeled RNA adjusted to give an equal number of counts per filter .
Hybridization was carried out for 96 h at 42 °C and filters washed in 2 x SSC for 10 min at room temperature and 1 x SSC , 0.1 % SDS , 1 mm EDTA for 70 min at 42 °C with three changes .
The identical TALI cDNA probe used for Northern blot hybridization was used in nuclear run-off assays .
The actin probe was a PstVPstl fragment of the mouse actin clone PAMQ1 containing the entire « -actin coding region ( 38 ) .
Washed filters were exposed to film and the resulting autoradiograms analyzed by laser scanning densitometry .
Binding of radiolabeled RNA to immobilized plasmid ( pGEM-42Z ) carried out in parallel was minimal and not included in data analysis .

Differences from that at initiation of culture were analyzed by a two-tailed £ test .
RNA Stability Analysis-Cultures of FVA cells were incubated for 2 h with or without 2 units/ml recombinant Epo , following which actinomycin D was added at a concentration of 5 ug/ml .
Previous studies established that this concentration of actinomycin D was sufficient to inhibit transcription in FVA cells without significant toxicity during the period analyzed ( 33 ) .
Total cellular RNA was isolated at 30 min intervals for up to 3 h following actinomycin D treatment and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization as described .
The resulting autoradiograms were analyzed by laser scanning densitometry , and the mean percentage of initial mRNA remaining + S.E .
from four independent experiments was expressed for both Epo-treated and Epo-deprived cells as a function of time following addition of actinomycin D to culture ( 33 ) .
Linear regression analysis was used to determine the best fit of the line for log transformed data and 95 % confidence intervals determined for slopes .
Immunoblot Analysis-Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits against a bacterial expressed malE-fusion containing the 72 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of murine TAL1 has been previously described ( 26 ) .
Total immunoglobulin was purified from serum obtained prior to immunization on protein A-Sepharose and used at an equivalent concentration where indicated .
Equal amounts ( 39 ) of FVA cell nuclear protein prepared as described for electrophoretic mobility shift analysis were fractionated on gradient ( 8-15 % ) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose .
Membranes were probed with antibody as described ( 40 ) and binding detected by enhanced chemilu-minescence ( ECL , Amersham ) .
Autoradiograms were analyzed by laser scanning densitometry , and data from four independent experiments were used in determining the mean TAL1 protein level as a function of time following Epo addition .
The ratio of TAL1 protein levels in Epo-treated versus Epo-deprived cultures was determined at each time point and differences from that at initiation of culture , assigned a value of 1.0 , were analyzed by a two-tailed ?
test .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis-Nuclear extracts were prepared from FVA cells using the method of Dignam et al .
( 41 ) with slight modification .
Washed FVA cells were suspended in a chilled buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl , , 10 mm KCl , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 0.2 mx EDTA , 0.2 mM EGTA , 5 pg/ml aprotinin , 5 pg/ml leupeptin , 1 mx phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 mM sodium vanadate , and 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.8 , and nuclei isolated with a Dounce homogenizer , Nuclei were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min , washed once , and resuspended in chilled 1.5 mm MgCl , , 420 mm KCI , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 25 % glycerol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 0.2 mm EGTA , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.8 , containing 50 ug/ml aprotinin , 25 ug/ml leupeptin , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 1 mm sodium vanadate .
The resulting extracts were stirred on ice for 30 min , clarified by centrifugation at 28,000 x g for 20 min , and stored in aliquots at -70 °C until used .
Double stranded oligonucleotides of the indicated sequences were end-labeled with *°P by T4 polynucleotide kinase and incubated with nuclear extracts ( 20 ug ) diluted in 20 % glycerol , 100 mM KCI , 0.5 mx dithiothreitol , 0.2 mM EDTA , 20 mx MgCl , , 20 mm Hepes , pH 7.8 , with or without the indicated antibodies for 20 min at room temperature in a binding buffer containing 2.5 mM dithiothreitol , 100 mM KCI , 60 mm MgCl , , 1 mm EDTA , 1 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) , and 100 mm Hepes , pH 7.8 , in 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san $ 4g wor ; papeojumo ( Erythropoietin and TAL1/SCL Expression tos a # # oe o Fic .

RESULTS Epo Induces an Increase in Steady State TAL1 mRNA Levels in FVA-induced Erythroblasts-Incubation of FVA cells with recombinant Epo resulted in proportional increases in the steady state levels of both the 5.0- and 3.7-kb TALI mRNAs within 30 min of growth factor addition ( Figs .
1 and 2 ) .
The maximum stimulated level was observed at 2 h , with a mean increase after correction for RNA loading of 3.5- and 3.0-fold for the larger and smaller species , respectively , relative to that measured at the initiation of culture ( Fig .
2 ) .
A dose-dependent increase in TALI mRNA was noted over the range of Epo concentrations observed in response to anemia ( 0.16-2 units/ ml ) , with near-maximal responses obtained at concentrations greater than 1 unit/ml ( not shown ) .
Message was detected for at least 72 h following Epo addition .
TAL1 mRNA was detected in erythroblasts prior to culture and was maintained at similar levels for up to 4 h in cultures without added growth factor ( Fig .
2 ) .
The propensity of these cells to undergo apoptosis in the absence of Epo ( 28 ) precluded their being cultured under these conditions for longer periods .
The increase in TAL1 message observed in Epo-treated FVA cell cultures did not reflect a general change in RNAs encoding transcription factors .

increase for at least 2-4 h of culture and that of the related HLH gene LYL-1 was not affected by Epo addition ( not shown ) .
Epo Stimulates Transcription of the TAL1 Gene in FVA-induced Erythroblasts-The effect of Epo on TAL1 transcription was analyzed in nuclear run-off studies ( Fig .
3 ) .
Consistent with the results of Northern blot analysis , transcription of the TAL1 gene was detected in FVA cells at the initiation of culture .
In Epo-treated cells , TALI transcription increased a mean 2.3-fold within 1 h following the addition of growth factor and remained above the initial level for at least 4 h. No effect of Epo was seen on actin transcription in the first 4 h of culture , consistent with previous measurements of actin mRNA levels in Epo-treated FVA cells during this period ( 33 ) .
These results indicate that Epo-stimulated accumulation of TALI message results in part from an increase in transcription of the gene .
Epo Causes Differential Stabilization of TAL1 mRNA Species in FVA-induced Erythroblasts-To determine whether the Epo-induced increase in steady state levels of TALI mRNAs also reflected any change in their stability , TAL1 message was measured by Northern blot analysis in cultures treated with actinomycin D at a concentration previously determined to inhibit transcription ( 33 ) .
The two major species of TALI mRNA , which diverge in their 3 ' untranslated regions and utilize different polyadenylation sites ( 42 ) , were found to have different half-lives .
Treatment of FVA cells with Epo ( 2 units/ ml ) for 2 h significantly affected the slope of the decay curve of the 5.0-kb TAL 1 message ( p < 0.05 ) , resulting in a prolongation in the calculated half-life from approximately 2 to 3.5 h ( Fig .
4 ) .
The stability of the 3.7-kb message was unaltered by Epo treatment , with the calculated half-life remaining approximately 1 h in both the presence and absence of Epo .
Thus , RNA stabilization also contributes to Epo-induced accumulation of 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san $ 4g wor ; 11606 Erythropoietin and TAL1/SCL Expression 3 Fic .

Epo Increases Nuclear TAL1 Protein Accumulation in FVA-induced Erythroblasts-Nuclear TAL1 protein was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibody generated to carboxyl-terminal sequences .
A series of TAL1 proteins with molecular masses of 45-47 kDa increased in abundance by approximately 2-fold as determined by densitometry in Epo-treated versus Epo-deprived cells 1-2 h following the increase in message ( Fig .
5 , A and B ) .
Another TAL1 protein with a molecular mass of 24 kDa was expressed transiently in Epo-stimulated cells , peaking at 2 h and then largely disappearing by 4 h after growth factor addition ( Fig .
5A ) .
This protein has been noted in T-lymphoid , myeloid , and erythroleukemia cell lines ( 43 , 44 ) , although it has not previously been found to vary in expression .
None of these proteins were detected with preimmune immunoglobulin ( not shown ) .
The molecular masses of all TAL1 species , particularly the truncated form , were different in FVA than in COS cells ( Fig .
5A ) , suggesting that unique or more extensive modifications of the proteins occur in differentiating erythroblasts .
Epo Stimulates TAL1 DNA Binding Activity in FVA-induced Erythroblasts-Since the genomic targets of this transcription factor are not yet known , two different E-box sequences were used as probes in mobility shift assays of TAL1 DNA binding activity .
One was from the 4E2 immunoglobulin enhancer , to which TAL1 had been demonstrated to bind as a heterodimer with the E12 and E47 protein products of the E2A gene ( 16 ) .

Relative induction preferred sequence for DNA binding ( 45 ) .
Using the uE2 oligonucleotide , a TAL1-containing protein-DNA complex was noted following incubation of FVA cell nuclear extracts with radiolabeled probe ( arrowhead , Fig .
6A ) that was not observed in the presence of excess unlabeled competitor ( lane 2 ) or with the use of a radiolabeled mutant oligonucleotide containing base substitutions in the E-box motif ( lane 3 ) .
Binding was disrupted by anti-TAL1 antibody ( lane 4 ) but not by preimmune immunoglobulin ( lane 5 ) or antibody to the bHLH protein LYL-1 ( 26 ) ( lane 6 ) , confirming the presence of TAL1 protein in the retarded complex .
A slightly less retarded complex was also noted with the uE2 oligonucleotide that appeared to follow the same kinetics as that of the TAL1-containing complex .
It was similarly ablated by excess unlabeled probe but , in contrast to the TAL1-containing complex , was intensified by preincubation of I I I I 1 2 3 4 Time ( hr ) extracts with anti-TAL1 antibody ( Fig .
6A ) .
TAL1 DNA binding activity increased within 1 h of addition of Epo to culture but declined subsequently despite the continuous presence of growth factor ( Fig .
6B ) .
DNA binding activity decreased rapidly in the absence of Epo , demonstrating it to be both Epo-dependent as well as Epo-inducible in FVA cell cultures ( Fig .
6C ) .
A specific TAL1-containing protein-DNA complex was also identified when FVA cell nuclear extracts were incubated with the preferred E-box sequence as probe ( Fig .

Although additional complexes were noted with this oligonucleotide , not all of which represented sequence-specific binding , only the most retarded band was affected by anti-TAL1 antibody .
In extracts treated with antibody , this TAL1-containing complex was supershifted to the extent that it was unable to enter the 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san $ 4g wor ; 11608 Erythropoietin and TAL1/SCL Expression A B C Hours Hours 1 g 5 1002 3 400 5006 0 403 50 24 Epo o l 0 4 10 4 % G0 + * $ # A ea O tn tn on f f\ A oe @ y on do Gn aan AW WWb ) |O 840| clay [ Fic .

The effect of Epo on TAL1 DNA binding activity assayed with the preferred sequence was generally similar to that noted using the uE2 probe , except that peak binding activity occurred later ( Figs .
6B and 7B ) .
Epo Stimulates Nuclear TAL1 Protein Phosphorylation in FVA-induced Erythroblasts-The disparity between TAL1 protein accumulation and DNA binding activity , particularly with the lower affinity uE2 probe , prompted us to investigate whether the TAL1 protein products might be regulated at a post-translational level in Epo-treated FVA cells .
As TAL1 had been previously shown to undergo phosphorylation in cell lines ( 43 , 46 , 47 ) , the effect of Epo on TAL1 protein phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts from FVA cells labeled with [ *PJorthophosphate .
A 47-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein specifically recognized by the anti-TAL1 antibody was more highly labeled in Epo-treated compared with Epo-deprived cells ( Fig .
8A ) .
Two radiolabeled proteins of 67 and 82 kDa were also specifically coimmunoprecipitated with TAL1 in Epo-stimulated FVA cell nuclear extracts .
Time course studies showed that phosphorylation of pp47 '' ** '' increased within 1 h of growth factor addition and then declined over time ( Fig .
8B ) , with equivalent results obtained if extracts were normalized for immunoprecipitation by trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts ( Fig .
8B ) or by protein concentration ( not shown ) .
This effect was restricted to a nuclear pool of TAL1 protein in that no net increase in TAL1 phosphorylation was apparent when total cellular extracts or cytoplasmic extracts were similarly analyzed ( not shown ) .
DISCUSSION Studies of TALI expression have shown that the gene is transcribed in erythroid progenitors and suggested its protein products have a role in erythroid differentiation .
Recently , Chiba et al .
( 48 ) reported that Epo could induce the accumulation of TAL1 message in an interleukin 3-dependent cell line engineered to express the Epo receptor ( EpoR ) .
Our experiments using bulk populations of Friend virus-induced erythroblasts demonstrate that TALI transcription is an early response to Epo stimulation .
Together , these results indicate that activation of the TALI gene is a component of the growth factor 's signaling mechanism and suggest TAL1 may be involved in mediating Epo 's actions on erythroid progenitor cells .
Like those of hexamethylene bisacetamide and Me , SO on MEL lines ( 21 , 27 ) , Epo 's effects in cultured FVA-induced erythroblasts were on cells already expressing TALI mRNA and protein .
These results could be explained by TALI transcription having been activated at some earlier stage of differentiation ( 49 ) and then later becoming Epo-responsive , with either an increase in the rate of ongoing transcription or de novo activation of an alternate promoter ( 50-52 ) .
GATA-1 has been shown to transac-tivate the proximal TAL 1 promoter in erythroid cells ( 50 , 52 ) and , as it is also expressed in FVA cells prior to the addition of Epo , could contribute to this basal level of expression .
Alternatively , spleen focus-forming virus-encoded gp55 envelope protein , whose actions appear to be mediated by membrane-displayed EpoR ( 53 , 54 ) , could have acted in an Epo-independent manner to stimulate 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san $ 4g wor ; Erythropoietin and TAL1/SCL Expression Fic .

Effect of Epo on TAL1 DNA binding activity in FVA-induced erythroblasts .
Nuclear extracts from FVA cells cultured under the indicated conditions were subjected to EMSA using a *°P-labeled double stranded oligonucleotide containing the preferred binding sequence .
A , nuclear extracts ( 10 ug ) from FVA cells cultured for 1 h with Epo ( 2 units/ml ) were incubated with radiolabeled probe ( lane 1 ) , radiolabeled mutant oligonucleotide with base substitutions in the E-box motif ( lanre 2 ) , antibody to murine TAL1 with radiolabeled probe ( lane 3 ) , preimmune immunoglobulin with radiolabeled probe ( lane 4 ) , and antibody to murine LYL-1 with radiolabeled probe ( lane 5 ) .

TAL1 transcription .
Against this possibility is the observation that the Epo-dependent erythroleukemia cell line HCD-57 ( 55 ) , which does not express gp55 , also continues to express TAL1 after Epo is removed . ''
In addition to any effect of retroviral proteins , heterogeneity exists in FVA cells in terms of the concentration of Epo required to prevent apoptosis ( 56 ) , so that the continued expression of TALI mRNA and protein in cultures deprived of Epo could have also reflected the persistence of a subpopulation of cells much less dependent upon the growth factor for survival .
Whatever the mechanism underlying the component of Epo-independent TALI expression observed in these cells , an Epo-induced increase in the level or activity of the TAL1 protein products may be required for completion of the erythroid differentiation program , as previously suggested for GATA-1 ( 57 ) .
The increase in TAL1 mRNA in Epo-treated FVA cells was followed after a 1-2 h lag by an increase in the concentration of * K. S. S. Prasad , J. E. Jordan , M. J. Koury , M. C. Bondurant , and S. J. Brandt , unpublished data .

Effect of Epo on TAL1 protein phosphorylation in FVA-induced erythroblasts .
A , FVA cells were cultured in phosphate-free medium containing [ *PJorthophosphate ( 0.9 mCi/ml ) for 3 h in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of Epo ( 5 units/ml ) and nuclear extracts prepared as described under `` Materials and Methods . ''
Equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts ( 3 x 10° cpm ) were immuno-precipitated with anti-TAL1 antibody ( Ab ) or preimmune immunoglobulin ( Pre ) and immunoprecipitates resolved by electrophoresis on an 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
An autoradiogram of the dried gel is shown .
B , FVA cells were cultured in phosphate-free medium containing [ *P Jorthophosphate ( 0.5 mCi/ml ) for 15 min in the absence of Epo .
Epo ( 5 units/ml ) was added to half of cultures and nuclear extracts prepared from cells incubated in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of Epo following an additional 1 , 2 , and 3 h in culture .
Equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts ( 540,000 cpm ) from each extract were immu-noprecipitated with anti-TAL1 antibody and resolved by electrophoresis on an 8 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel .
An autoradiogram of dried gel is shown .
TAL1 and coimmunoprecipitating proteins are better seen in autoradiogram in panel A than B because of the greater amount of label added to cultures and greater mass of protein immunoprecipitated .
full-length protein in the nucleus , while an N-terminally truncated 24-kDa TAL1 protein , derived from a series of spliced RNAs converging on the second coding exon ( 43 ) , was only transiently expressed ( Fig .
5 ) .
Since ribonuclease protection analysis has shown that at least one RNA species from which this protein could be translated is highly abundant in these cells , '' this pattern of expression suggests that either its stability or translation may be regulated by Epo .
As a result of splicing , a transcriptional activation domain found in the full-length protein ( 58 ) is deleted , while the dimerization and DNA-binding motifs would be retained .
Although the function of this truncated TAL1 species is not yet known , there exist a number of examples of transcriptional repressors and activators , often with similarly overlapping patterns of expression , being encoded by the same gene as a result of alternative splicing 6107 '01 Aepy uo 1san $ 4g wor ; 11610 ( reviewed in Ref .
59 ) .
TAL1 DNA binding activity increased with a shorter latency in Epo-stimulated FVA cells than predicted by the more delayed increase seen in TAL1 protein levels and then declined even while mRNA and protein accumulated ( Figs .
6 and 7 ) .
This pattern could reflect specific modifications of TAL1 protein , the availability or activity of its dimerization partners , changes in the concentration of negative regulators , or any combination of these .
The initial increase in DNA binding activity correlated temporally with the accumulation of nuclear TAL1 phosphoprotein ( Fig .
8 ) , raising the possibility that phosphorylation might regulate this function .
Phosphorylation is known to affect the nuclear uptake , affinity and specificity of DNA binding , and activity of a variety of trangeription factors ( reviewed in Ref .
60 ) , and its effects on TAL1 function may well be multifactorial .
Serine 122 of TAL1 is phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK-1 in leukemic cell lines and transfected COS cells ( 47 ) , which would be predicted to oceur also in response to Epo ( 61 , 62 ) , and this was shown recently to increase the activity of the transcriptional activation domain ( 63 ) .
The heterogeneity seen on one- and two-dimensional immunoblot analysis and , particularly , tryptic phosphopeptide mapping ( 47 ) ° indicate that additional sites are phosphorylated and suggest the TAL1 proteins can also be substrates for other protein kinases .
The results of phos-phoamino acid analysis indicate that TAL1 phosphorylation in Friend virus-induced erythroblasts , as reported for leukemic cell lines and transfected COS cells ( 43 ) , occurs exclusively on serine . ''
TAL1 , like other tissue-specific or class II HLH proteins ( 64 ) , binds DNA as a heterodimer , so that its DNA binding activity might also be regulated indirectly through its binding partners .
The ultimate decline in TAL1 E-box binding activity in Epo-treated FVA cells , then , could potentially be explained by either a decrease in the concentration of E proteins , with which TAL1 has been shown to bind DNA ( 17 ) , or to an increase in inhibitors of DNA binding , such as the Id proteins .
Although TAL1 was reported to interact only weakly with Id1 and Id2 ( 65 , 66 ) , Id1 was shown to inhibit the binding of E2A-TAL1 heterodimers to E-box sequences ( 67 ) .
The levels of Id1 and Id2 message decline with differentiation in MEL lines ( 35 , 65 , 66 ) , however , and Id1 mRNA could not be detected at the sensitivity of Northern blot analysis in FVA cells at any time in culture ( not shown ) , suggesting the accumulation of negative regulators to be a less likely explanation for the decline in DNA binding activity observed in these differentiating erythroid cells .
Experiments with erythroleukemia cell lines have suggested a function for the TAL ] gene in erythroid differentiation ( 21 , 27 ) .
In normal human and murine erythroid precursors , however , studies at the resolution of the single cell indicate that TAL1 mRNA and protein expression become progressively down-regulated with terminal differentiation ( 24 , 68 ) .
Our results show that at the late colony forming unit-erythroid to proerythroblast stage of erythroid differentiation represented by FVA cells , TAL 1 transcription , translation , and DNA binding activity are , at least initially , stimulated by Epo .
While the exact actions of the TAL ] gene products in erythroid differentiation remain to be determined , our studies establish a link between signaling by the peptide hormone that controls the terminal events of erythropoiesis and a member of a transcription factor family involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages .
