M. ] , Royal Postgraduate Medical School , Ducane Road , London , W12 OHS , United Kingdom ABSTRACT We have examined mononuclear cell preparations from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia [ CML ] for binding of and response to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [ 1,25- { OH ) D ; ] .
Whole cells specifically took up [ °H } ] -1,25- { OH ) : D ; with high affinity ( Ky 3.6 x 107 '' m ) and low capacity .
Subcellular fractionation of labeled cells showed that binding was restricted to cytosols and nuclei .
Sucrose gradient centrifugation of cells preincubated with PH ] -1,25-4 { OH ) D ; revealed a single 3.6S peak which was totally displaced with 100-fold excess nonradioactive hormone .
However , we were unable to demonstrate specific binding of 1,25- ( OH ) D ; by postlabeling standard cytosol preparations .
In addition , cytosols prepared from a mixture of CML cells and 1,25- ( OH ) Ds receptor-positive T47D ( human breast cancer ) cells had les » than 10 % of the binding measured in T47D cytosol alone .
However , the levels of binding in T47D cytosols were not reduced if the receptors were occupied with [ °H ] -1,25- ( OH ) D ; prior to the addition of the CML cytosols .
Thus , CML cells appear to contain both the receptor for 1,25 < { OH ) D ; and an unknown substance which prevents its detection following the preparation of cytosol .
Cells from patients with CML in the chronic phase specifically bound more [ 18.0 + 3.2 ( S.E . )
fmol/10 ' cells ] than did those in acute myeloid transformation [ 7.2 + 1.5 ] or than did cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia [ 2.6 + 0.8 ] .
Only cells from the first group of patients responded to the addition of 1,25- ( OH ) D ; by differentiating along the monocyte-macrophage pathway .
We conclude that the differentiation-induction effect of 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; is likely to depend on adequate levels of receptor and that intact cells rather than cytosol preparations should be studied before cells of a particular tissue are designated as receptor negative .
INTRODUCTION Recently , studies on the distribution of the specific binding protein for 1,25- ( OH ) D ; ° have suggested several new sites of action for this calcium-regulating hormone .
Ten years ago , intes-tine , bone , and kidney were the only target tissues known , but now the list includes other calcium-transporting organs ( breast , placenta ) , endocrine glands producing hormones thought to * Present address : Department of Medicine , University of Minnesota , Minneap-olis , MN .

AUGUST 1984 regulate the renal 25-OHDs hydroxylases ( parathyroids , pituitary , ovary , etc .
) , and other sites where the function of 1,25- { OH ) D ; is more obscure ( skin , brain ) ( 13 ) .
1,25-4 { OH ) D ; receptors are also present in a number of neo-plastic tissues and in cell lines derived from them ( 4-6 , 9 ) .
The presence of the receptor in transformed cells has generally been assumed to represent a retained property of the parent tissue .
Biological effects of 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; in cancer cells have been harder to demonstrate , although effects on proliferation in breast ( 8 ) , melanoma ( 3 ) , and bone ( 11 ) cells in culture have now been seen .
In contrast , prior to the demonstration of a receptor , Abe et al .
( 1 ) found that 1,25- { OH ) Ds induced monncytic differentiation in a murine leukemia cell line ( M1 ) .
They also reported that 1,25- ( OH ) » Ds caused granulocytic differentiation of cells from a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line ( HL6O0 ) and showed that these cells possessed the cytosolic receptor for 1,25- { OH ) D ; ( 19 ) .
The biological effects produced by different cholecalciferol metabolites in these cells correlated well with their affinity for the 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; receptor .
The differentiation of these cells was accompanied by a slowing of proliferation , and the potential significance of this has been emphasized recently by the same group 's demonstration of prolonged survival times in mice given injections of M1 cells , when treated with 1,25- { OH ) D ; or 1a-hydrox-ycholecalciferol ( 10 ) .
In our laboratory , we have found that 1,25- { OH ) D ; causes monocytic differentiation of HL6O cells , as judged by morphology , cytochemistry , and the presence of specific surface antigens .
We have also seen similar effects in normal bone marrow ( 12 ) .
In addition , Bar-Shavit et al .
( 2 ) have recently demonstrated 1,25-monocytic differentiation of HLG6O .
We here report the characterization of specific 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; uptake and response of mononuclear cells from patients with myeloid leu-kemias .
MATERIALS AND METHODS [ PH ] -1,25- ( O0H ) D ; ( specific radioactivity , 163 Ci/mmol ) was purchased from Amersham International ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom ) .
Nonradioactive cholecaiciferol metabolites were a gift from Roche Products ( Welwyn Garden City , Hertsfordshire , United Kingdom ) .
Reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from commercial suppliers .
Bone marrow or buffy coat cells were obtained from patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML when they were either in the chronic stage of their disease or in acute myeloid transformation ( 17 ) .
Cells were also obtained from patients with AML .
The mononuclear fraction was prepared by layering the cell suspension onto Lymphoprep ( Nyegaard , Ltd. , Oslo , Norway ) , centrifuging at 400 x g for 25 min , and collecting the cells at the interface .

cytosolic binding of 1,25- { OH ) D ; .
Cytosols were prepared by sonicating cells ( 2 to 5 x 10 '' /mi ) on ice in a Tris buffer ( KTEDMT ) known to optimize 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; receptor measurement in other systems ( 20 ) .
The homog-enates were centrifuged at 88,000 x g for 30 min at 4° in the 70Ti rotor of a Beckman L8 70 ultracentrifuge .
Binding of [ °H ] -1,25- ( OH ) D ; was assayed in these cytosols as described previously ( 8 ) .
Whole-Cell Uptake .
Specific uptake of [ °H ] -1,25- { OH ) ; D ; by intact cell preparations was determined largely as described by Sher et a/ .
( 18 ) , except that a shorter incubation time was found to be sufficient to maximize binding .
Cells ( 5 x 10° ) were suspended in triplicate for 3 hr at 37° in 0.5 mi RPMI 1640 plus 0.05 % BSA with 0.1 pmo !
PH ] -1,25- ( OH ) Ds in the presence or absence of 10 pmol 1,25- { ( OH ) ; D , or 25-OHDs .
At the end of the incubation , cells were spun down ( 800 x g , 5 min ) and resuspended in 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline ( 8 g NaCI , 0.2 g KCI , and 0.2 g NaHPO , in 100 mi distilled HO ) containing 0.5 % ( w/v ) BSA for 20 min at room temperature .
The suspensions were pelleted , rinsed once more in phosphate-buffered saline alone , and then dissolved in 0.5 ml 1 m NaOH .
The pH was corrected to 7.4 with glacial acetic acid , prior to counting in 10 ml scintillant ES299 ( Packard Instruments , Caversham , Berkshire , United Kingdom ) using a Packard Tri-Carb liquid scintillation counter with an efficiency for tritium of 30 % .
Further competition studies were performed on some preparations by incubating cells , as described above , with 0.06 pmol [ °H ] -1,25- { OH ) : Ds ; and increasing amounts of cholecalciferol , its metabolites , or other steroids ( 10~® to 10~ '' '' mol ) .
The affinity between CML cells and [ °H ] -1,25- ( OH ) D ; was determined by incubating cells ( 5 x 10° ) with increasing amounts ( 0.01 to 0.15 pmol ) of [ °H ] -1,25- ( OH ) D ; for 3 hr at 37° ; parallel incubations in the presence of 100-fold excess nonradioactive 1,25- ( OH ) .D ; were used to determine nonspecific uptake .
Cells were processed prior to liquid scintillation counting as described above .
Data were analyzed by the method of Scatchard ( 16 ) .
In addition , cytosols were prepared as before from cells prelabeled with 0.1 pmol !
+ 10 ( S.E . )
pmol , 1,25 { OH ) ; Ds or 25-OHDs at 37° for 3 hr .
The cytosols were applied to 5 to 20 % sucrose gradients ( w/v in KTEDMT ) and spun at 288,000 x g for 15 hr at 4° in the SW55 rotor of a Beckman L870 ultracentrifuge .
Gradients were divided into 150-4l fractions from the bottom by downward displacement with mineral oil .
Subcellular Localization .
Cells which had been incubated with tritiated hormone and rinsed as described were homogenized by resus-pending in hypotonic buffer ( TEDT ) , followed by 10 passages through a 25-gauge needle .
This procedure lysed more than 95 % of the cells .
KCI in TEDT was added to give a final concentration of 0.15 m KCI .
Homog-enates were spun at 800 x g for 5 min .
The supernatants were recentrifuged at 88,000 x g for 30 min to yield a clear cytosol and a pellet which was presumed to consist largely of mitochondria and microsomes .
The 800 x g pellet was rinsed in TEDT , recentrifuged , and suspended in 1 m sucrose in TEDT .
This was layered onto a sucrose pad ( 1.7 m sucrose in TEDT ) and centrifuged at 30,000 x g for 20 min .
The sucrose buffers were aspirated to leave a pellet of semipurified nuclei , which were resuspended in KTEDMT and incubated on ice for 20 min .
They were recentrifuged at 800 x g , and the radioactivities in the supernatants and pellets were counted separately .
Combination Experiments .
in an attempt to explain the apparent lack of specific [ °H ] -1,25- { /OH ) D ; binding in CML cytosols , specific binding of the hormone to cytosols prepared from a receptor-positive human breast cancer cell line [ T47D ( 8 ) ] was measured alone or in combination with CML cytosol .
T47D cells were grown as described previously ( 8 ) , suspended in KTEDMT ( 2 x 10 '' cells/ml ) and mixed with either CML cells ( 5 x 10 '' cells/ml ) or an equal volume of BSA ( 1 mg/ml ) .
The cell suspensions were sonicated , and cytosols were prepared and assayed for specific [ °H ] -1,25- { OH ) D ; binding as before .
Cell Differentiation .
Cells from patients with CML or AML were incubated with 107° to 107° m 1,25- ( OH ) D ; or 25-OHDs as described previously for normal bone marrow and HLGO cells ; they were character 3628 IOOPN A ® u + E \ 3 E 3 E `` s # so|-T C a P- ] cm AN 3 .

Competition for [ °H ] -1,25- { OH ) : D , uptake into whole CML cells .
CML cells ( 5 x 10° ) were incubated in duplicate for 3 hr at 37° with 0.06 pmol ( °H ] -1,25- ( OH ) @ D , alone or in the presence of various amounts ( 10~ '' to 107* m ) of cholecalciferol or its metabolites .

Competing steroids were 1,25- ( OH ) Ds ( @ ) , 25-OHD ; ( A ) , 24,25-dihydrox-ycholecalciferol ( I ) , or cholecalciferol ( ® ) .
Similar results were seen with cells from 3 other CML patients in chronic phase .
ized morphologically , enzymatically , and by reactivity with monocyte- or granulocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies ( 12 ) .
These results are being reported fully elsewhere .
* However , as an index of monocytic differentiation , the percentage of cells containing fluoride-sensitive a-naphthyl acetate esterase ( 22 ) was used .
RESULTS Despite clear evidence of biological activity of 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; in CML cells , only low to undetectable levels of specific binding ( 200 cpm/10 '' cells ) could be measured in cytosol preparations , using buffers and assay conditions found optimal for the receptor measured in other cytosols .
The level of binding was not enhanced by increasing the concentration of protease inhibitor ( Trasylol ) in the buffer .
As a consequence , the specific uptake of { °H ] -1,25-4 { O0H ) D ; by intact cells was examined .
CML cells incubated at 37° accumulated [ °H ] -1,25- { OH ) D ; in a time-dependent manner , reaching a maximum by 2 hr , which was maintained for at least 6 hr .
This uptake was partially displaceable by 100-fold excess 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; , but not by 25-OHDs .
Competition studies using multiple concentrations of cholecaiciferol metabolites showed that both 25-O0HD ; and 24,25-dihydroxycholecaliciferol could block the specific uptake of the label , but only at concentrations 200 to 1000 times higher than that required with 1,25- ( OH ) ; D ; ( Chart 1 ) .
Cholecalciferol , estra-diol , and hydrocortisone ( 107° m ) were all incapable of reducing the uptake of [ °H ] } -1,25- ( OH ) Ds .
The affinity of this interaction between 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; and CML cells was assessed using Scatchard analysis of saturation plots ( Chart 2 ) .

Specific binding was restricted to cytosols ( 29 % ) , nuclear extracts ( 29 % ) , and nuclear residues ( 41 % ) .
Similarly , labeled cells were homogenized by sonication in hypertonic buffer , cytosols were prepared , and the radioactivity in them was analyzed by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifu-gation .
A single peak was seen , migrating one fraction later than the 3.78 marker , which was totally abolished when cells were preincubated with excess 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; but only slightly reduced in the presence of excess 25-O0HD , ( Chart 3 ) .
No peak was visible when cytosols were incubated directly with tritiated hormone .
The specific uptake of [ °H ] -1,25- ( OH ) D ; by CML cells thus appeared to be due to a binding moiety with the characteristics of the 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; receptor found in other tissues .
In an attempt to discover why the receptor was not measurable in standard cytosol preparations , such cytosols were mixed with those from the receptor-positive T47D cells and binding assessed .
Specific binding was not detected in CML cytosols alone .
Cytosols obtained from a mixture of T47D and CML had only 5 to 10 % of the specific binding seen in cytosols prepared from T47D cells alone ( Chart 4 ) .
This loss of binding was seen whether homog-enates were prepared by hypotonic lysis or sonication and also , although to a slightly reduced extent , when binding was assayed at 4° , rather than at 25° .

ence of CML cytosols ( Chart 4 ) , thus suggesting that occupation of the 1,25- ( OH ) .D ; receptor prevents its inactivation by CML cytosols .
The studies reported above were performed using mononuclear cells from patients with CML in the chronic phase of their disease .
Using a single saturating dose assay , specific uptake of 1,25- ( OH ) D ; by cells of this type was 18.0 + 3.2 fmol/ 10 '' cells ( n = 6 ) .
Cells taken from patients with the same disease , but in acute transformation , had only one-half this level of specific uptake , and those from patients with AML accumulated still less 1,25- { OH ) D ; ( Table 1 ) .
CML cells in chronic phase reproducibly differentiated along the monocyte-macrophage pathway in response to 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; as judged by a fluoride-sensitive positive reaction with a-naphthyl acetate esterase ( Table 1 ) .
Although , as previously observed in AML ( 14 ) , cells from patients with CML blast crisis or AML showed some spontaneous monocytic differentiation upon culture in vitro , this differentiation was not enhanced by 1,25- { OH ) ; Ds .
DISCUSSION The uptake of 1,25- ( OH ) D ; by mononuclear cells from CML patients is of high affinity and specific to this active metabolite of cholecalciferol .
Furthermore , homogenization of cells prelabeled with hormone showed that the specifically bound radioactivity was restricted to cytosols and nuclei .
Sucrose density centrifugation of high-salt cytosols allowed the detection of a 3.5- to 3.7S peak which was totally abolished when cells were preincubated with 100-fold excess 1,25- { OH ) D ; , but only slightly reduced when 25-OHD ; was the competitor .
These data , particularly when considered in conjunction with our evidence for biological responses to 1,25- { OH ) Ds , clearly suggest that CML cells contain the specific 1,25- ( OH ) D ; receptor with the same characteristics as those seen in classic target tissues ( 7 , 13 , 21 ) .
Our failure to detect this protein in standard cytosol preparations suggested that homogenization of CML cells led to the inactivation of 1,25- ( OH ) D ; receptors , either by proteolytic degrada-tion , by chemical modification , or by blocking of the binding site by an alternative endogenous ligand .
We therefore investigated the effects of addition of CML cytosol to the 1,25- { OH ; ) Ds receptor content of T47D cell cytosols .
This led to a reduction of approximately 90 % in the levels of specific binding measured in T47D cytosols .
The loss of binding occurred at 4° as well as 25° , and increasing the concentration of Trasylol in the buffer did not permit the detection of receptor in CML cytosols .
It 3630 therefore seemed unlikely that enzymatic degradation was responsible for the receptor loss .
When receptors in T47D cells were occupied with [ °H ] } -1,25 { OH ) ; D ; prior to the addition of CML cytosol , a reduction in the binding subsequently assayed did not occur .
Thus , the inactivation process is likely to involve parts of the receptor molecule at or near the 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; binding site , which are protected in the presence of the ligand .
The exact nature of this process awaits further investigation ; a number of agents are known which inactivate the unoccupied 1,25- ( OH ) D ; receptor , while not affecting the hormone-bound form , e.g. , the sulfhydryl alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide ( 21 ) .
If our interpretation of these results is correct and CML cells contain 1,25- ( OH ) D ; receptors which are not routinely measurable in cytosols , it is possible that other cells may possess receptors which have not been detected for similar reasons .
Previous quantitation of receptors in established target tissues may be inaccurate , since the levels measured would represent a balance between the intrinsic content and the inactivating capacity of the tissue .
However , addition of cytosol prepared from breast tumors does not appear to diminish the levels of receptor seen in T47D cytosois . ''
Cells from patients with either AML or CML in acute transformation take up less 1,25- { OH ) D ; than CML cells in chronic phase .
In addition , these more primitive cells do not , in our experience , differentiate in response to 1,25- { OH ) ; D ; .
This suggests that possession of adequate levels of receptor is necessary for the occurrence of the biological effect .
It also suggests that the amount of receptor present in myeloid leukemic cells varies with their state of maturity and that more primitive , less differentiated cells have not yet developed their capacity to respond to 1,25 { OH ) Ds .
Preliminary results indicate that a similar receptor exists in marrow cells taken from normal donors .
This is , in any case , likely since the distribution of myeloid cell types in chronic-phase CML marrow is similar to that found in normal marrow ( 17 ) .
The determination of which particular normal and transformed human blood cells are targets for 1,25- { ( OH ) D ; is now proceeding .
When normal or leukemic progenitor cells from human bone marrow differentiate into more mature forms , their ability to proliferate usually decreases .
Consequently , some approaches to leukemia therapy are now directed towards differentiating the tumor cells rather than simply killing them ( 15 ) .
1,25- ( OH ) D ; inhibits proliferation of HL6O cells in vitro ( 12 , 19 ) .
The growth of M1 mouse myeloid leukemia cells is also inhibited by 1,25- { OH ) Ds in vitro ( 1 ) , and the same phenomenon occurs in vivo ( 10 ) .
Thus , the experimental use of 1,25- ( OH ) D ; in therapy of some forms of leukemia and preleukemia must now be considered .
