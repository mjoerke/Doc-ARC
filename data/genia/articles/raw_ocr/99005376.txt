Differential Regulation of Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase Gene Between Erythroid and Nonerythroid Cells By Shinichiro Takahashi , Shigeru Taketani , Jun-etsu Akasaka , Akira Kobayashi , Norio Hayashi , Masayuki Yamamoto , and Tadashi Nagai Coproporphyrinogen oxidase ( CPO ) catalyzes the sixth step of the heme biosynthetic pathway .
To assess the tissue-specific regulation of the CPO gene promoter , mouse genomic DNA clones for CPO were isolated .
Structural analysis demonstrated that the mouse CPO gene spans approximately 11 kb and consists of seven exons , just like its human counterpart .
Functional analysis of the promoter by transient transfection assays indicated that synergistic action between an SP-1-like element at -21/-12 , a GATA site at -59/ -54 , and a novel regulatory element , CPRE ( -GGACTA-CAG- ) at -49/-41 , is essential for the promoter activity in HE BIOSYNTHESIS OF HEME is differently regulated between erythroid and nonerythroid cells .
During erythroid differentiation , the expression of each enzyme increases sequentially , beginning with the first enzyme of the pathway , erythroid-specific 8-aminolevulinate synthase ( ALAS-E ) . > '' In liver , on the other hand , under conditions that increase the rate of heme synthesis , only the first enzyme , nonspecific ( housekeep-ing ) ALAS-N is upregulated , while the level of other enzymes remains unchanged . ''
It is likely that this latter type of regulation may also take place in other nonerythroid tissues .
There are two principal reasons that account for the distinct tissue-specific regulation of heme synthesis .
The first is the finding that the two ALAS isozymes* '' are encoded by distinct genes , erythroid-specifically expressed , ALAS-E , and nonspe-cific , ALAS-N .
The second is that both S-aminolevulinate dehydratase and porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBGD ) , the second and third enzymes in the pathway , respectively , are transcribed from two distinct promoters in a tissue-specific manner with 5'-alternative splicing . ''
However , it is unclear whether there is distinct tissue-specific regulation of other enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway .

In nonerythroid NIH3T3 cells , however , the GATA site is not required .
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that specific DNA-protein complexes can be formed with each element , and that there are cell-specific differences in factors , which bind to the SP-1-like element between MEL and NIH3T3 cells .
These results provide evidence for differential regulation of the promoter function of CPO gene between erythroid and nonerythroid cells .

enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway , catalyzes the removal of the carboxyl group and two hydrogen atoms from the propionate groups at positions 2 and 4 of coproporphyrinogen III , resulting in the formation of vinyl groups at these posi-tions . ''
The mRNA level and activity of CPO have been shown to be significantly increased in murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells during dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) -induced erythroid cell differentiation , '' while they are unchanged in mouse liver by treatment with 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide , despite a potent induction of ALAS-N by the chemical . ''
These findings suggested that CPO expression might be regulated in a different manner between erythroid and nonerythroid cells .
Furthermore , CPO has been reported to become rate-limiting for heme synthesis during erythroid differentiation . ?
Thus , it is important to clarify the regulatory mechanism of CPO gene expression and its role in erythroid differentiation .
Recently , mouse and human cDNA clones and a human genomic DNA clone of CPO were isolated . !
* '' '' Structural analysis of the human CPO gene showed that it consists of seven exons spanning approximately 14 kb , and that CPO mRNA is transcribed from a single promoter both in erythroid and in nonerythroid cells . ''
Thus , it appears that a single promoter may regulate both inducible and constitutive expression of the CPO gene .
To examine the regulation of the CPO gene between erythroid and nonerythroid cells , we performed structural analysis of the mouse CPO gene and compared its promoter function in MEL and NIH3T3 cells .
Our results indicate that CPRE , a novel regulatory element found at -49/-41 , plays an essential role in CPO gene expression both in MEL and NIH3T3 cells , while interaction with GATA-1 and SP-1-like element-binding protein is additionally necessary for the maximal upregulation of the CPO gene in MEL cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation and characterization of mouse CPO genomic clones .
- The 129 SVJ mouse genomic library in the A FIXI vector ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) was screened using a 1.4-kb EcoRI-digested fragment of the mouse CPO cDNA clone containing the entire coding region as a probe . ''
Seven independent clones were obtained and mapped .
Because two overlapping clones , B6 and B8 , were found to cover the entire mouse CPO gene , they were used for further analysis .
Nucleotide sequences were determined with a cycle sequencing system using ABI 377 sequencer ( Perkin-Elmer Corp , Foster City , CA ) .

PCR products were isolated and sequenced .
Cell culture .
- MEL cells , clone 745A , and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco 's Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ; Nissui , Tokyo , Japan ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , and split every 3 days .
For preparation of nuclear extracts , cells from 24- to 48-hour-old cultures were resuspended in the fresh medium at a density of 5 X 10+ cells/mL and incubated for 16 hours , to ascertain a logarithmic cell growth .
Then DMSO was added at a concentration of 2 % ( vol/vol ) and incubation was continued for 24 hours .
While these cells did not show an increase in benzidine-positive cells at 24 hours , over 90 % of cells became benzidine-positive when incubation was continued for 4 days .
Plasmids .
A series of deletion mutants of the mouse CPO gene promoter were constructed , which were also fused to a luciferase reporter gene .
First , various DNA fragments of the mouse CPO gene promoter region were obtained by PCR using the following forward primers : - - ( spanning positions -958 to -935 ) , 5-ACAGCCGGTACCGAAGCTTGTG-3 ' ( -660 to -639 ) , 5'-TAGTTAAAGGGGTACCGAGCCC-3 ' ( -579 to -558 ) , 55-CTTTGGGTACCCCAAGCACAGG-3 ' ( -374 to -353 ) , 5 '' -CCACAGGTACCACGAAGACAAG-3 ' ( -330 to -309 ) , 5'-CTAACGGTACCTTTGCTCACTG-3 ' ( -262 to -241 ) , 5'-AAGGGG-TACCTGACTAAAGCGC-3 ' ( -217 to -196 ) , 5 '' -GCAGCGGTAC-CCACCTCTGTGC-3 ' ( -135 to -114 ) , 5'-TTTCCGGTAC-CGGTCAGGCGAG-3 ' ( -90 to -69 ) , 5'-CGAGGGTACCAGGC-GATAGGAC-3 ' ( -72 to =-51 ) , TAC-3 ' ( -64 to -43 ) , 5-GGACGGTACCACAGTTCCCAG-3 ' ( -54 to -34 ) , 5-GCCTGGTACCTACACTCGCAGC-3 ' ( -9 to +13 ) , and the acceptor primer , 5-ATCTCCAAGGTCCTCGAGGCCC-3 ' ( +50 to +71 ) .
The amplified DNA fragments were digested with Kpr I and Xho I and inserted into the Kpn I/Xho I site of the pGL3-Basic plasmid ( Promega , Madison , WID ) , which yielded pGL946 , pGL648 , pGL563 , pGL363 , pGL319 , pGL251 , pGL207 , pGL124 , pGL79 , pGL62 , pGL54 , pGL44 , and pGL2 .

TrEsfection and luciferase assays .
- A total of 2 ug of each reporter plasmid and 1 ug of pENL ' ( as an internal control ) were cotransfected into MEL cells using DOTAP ( N- [ 1- ( 2,3-dioleoyloxy ) propy1 ] -N , N , N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate ) ( Boehringer Mannheim Corp , India-napolis , IN ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Briefly , a total of 5 X 10° cells were incubated with the plasmids and DOTAP in 1 mL of DMEM without serum for 6 hours .
Then 2 mL of fresh DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum was added .
DMSO was added to cultures at a concentration of 2 % ( vol/vol ) and incubation was continued for 20 hours .
Cells were then harvested , rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) once , and lysed in 75 uL of 1 X Reporter Lysis Buffer ( Toyo Ink , Ltd , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Luciferase activities were determined using Luciferase Assay System ( Promega ) and normalized on the basis of B-galacto- 3437 sidase activities , which were determined using chlorophenol red-B-galactopyranoside as substrate . ' ''
NIH3T3 cells were also transfected with the reporter plasmids similarly .
NIH3T3 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 X 10° per 3 mL of DMEM in a 40-mm dish and incubated for 18 hours before transfection .
Preparation of nuclear extracts .
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method described by Lassar et al '' '' with minor modification .
Briefly , 1 X 10 '' cells were collected , washed once with PBS , pelleted , resuspended in 1 mL of the lysis buffer containing 10 mmol/L Tris-HC ] ( pH7.4 ) , 10 mmol/L NaCl , 3 mmol/L MgCl » , and 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 and placed on ice for 5 minutes .
After centrifuga-tion , nuclear pellets were resuspended in 100 uL of 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl ( pH7.9 ) , 420 mmol/L KCI , 0.2 mmol/L EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 2 mmol/L dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfony ] fluoride , placed on ice for 10 minutes , and centrifuged .
The supernatants thus obtained were used as nuclear extracts for gel mobility shift assays .
Protein concentration was determined by using a Protein Assay Kit ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) .
DNA gel mobility shift assays .
- The following oligomers were used as probes for gel mobility shift assays : CPRE , 5-ATAGGACGGGAC-TACAGTTCC-3 ' ; GATA , 5-TGCAGGAGGCGATAGGACGGGACT-3 ' ; SP-1-like , 5-CTCCTCGGCTCCCGCCAGCAGCCTGC-3 ' , corresponding to nucleotides -57 to -36 , -68 to -44 and -29 to -4 of the mouse CPO gene , respectively .
For SP-1 , 5'-GGACTTTATGGGGGC-GGGGCTAAAGGAGGG-3 ' was used , which included the consensus SP-1 binding site .
Oligomers were end-labeled with [ y- > 2P ] adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Boehringer Mannheim Corp ) .
The antisense oligomer was then added to the *P-end-labeled oligomer to yield a double-stranded probe .
A total of 5 ug of nuclear extracts was incubated in a reaction mixture containing 20 mmol/L HEPES buffer ( pH 7.8 ) , 60 mmol/L KCI , 0.2 mmol/L EDTA , 6 mmol/L MgCl » , 0.5 mmol/L DTT , 10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol , and 1.5 ug of an equimolar mixture of poly ( dI-dC ) and poly ( dA-dT ) with a `` P-labeled oligomer for 15 minutes on ice .
For competition assays , the following oligomers were used as double-stranded forms : AEGATA , 5'-TTTGGGTTTTATCTCTAGCAAGG-3 ' ( corresponding to nucleotides -135 to -113 of the human ALAS-E gene ) ; AECACCC , 5-CCGCAGAAGGCAGGGTGGGTGGG-3 ' ( corresponding to nucleotides -73 to -51 of the human ALAS-E gene ) ; and CPREm , 5'-ATAGGACGAGTTAATAATTCC-3 ' ( mutated CPRE containing 6 transversions in -49/-41 ) .
For supershift assays , 3 uL of anti-GATA-1 ( N6 ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc , Santa Cruz , CA ) was added to the reaction mixture after the addition of the probe .
The mixture was then loaded onto a 4 % polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 150 V at 4°C .
RESULTS Isolation of mouse CPO gene .
To clarify the regulatory mechanism of CPO gene expression , we first isolated genomic DNA clones , which encode mouse CPO protein from a mouse liver genomic DNA library .
As shown in Fig 1 , two overlapping clones , termed B6 and B8 , were isolated , which contained the entire gene including approximately up to 4 kb of the 5'-upstream region .
The organization of the mouse CPO gene was determined by Southern blot analysis using cDNA probes corresponding to various parts of the mouse CPO mRNA , and the sequence of each exon-intron junction was also determined .
This analysis showed that the mouse CPO gene consists of a total of seven exons , which spans approximately 11 kb .
The last exon ( exon 7 ) includes a large 3'-untranslated region ( Fig 1 ) .
The length of the introns varies from 652 bp to 2.4 kb , and all exon-intron boundaries conform completely to the GT/AG rule ( Table 1 ) .

strated that the mouse CPO is specified by a single genomic locus ( data not shown ) .
Sequencing analysis of the upstream region of the mouse CPO gene .
To investigate the regulatory mechanism of the mouse CPO gene , we determined the sequence of the 5'-upstream region up to ~1,200 bp from the transcription start site ( Fig 2 ) .
Notable features in this region are 12 putative GATA motives that contain the sequence nGATAn , and four CACCC elements with no obvious TATA or CAAT boxes .
An SP-1 consensus-like sequence , CTCCCGCCAG , was found near the transcription start site .
The presence of these cis-elements as well as their spatial arrangement are similar to those observed in the promoter region of the human CPO gene , '' '' which contains four GATA motives , six putative SP-1 binding sites , and two CACCC elements within a 786-bp region upstream from the transcription start site .
A novel regulatory element found at -49/-41 is critical for the mouse CPO promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells .
- To clarify the regulatory elements for constitutive CPO gene expression in nonerythroid cells , transient transfection assays were performed in NIH3T3 cells using a nested series of promoter deletion constructs fused to a luciferase reporter gene .
As shown in Fig 3 , p946 demonstrated a high level of the reporter activity .
The removal of the sequence between -946 and -54 , where all GATA and CACCC sites are found , did not significantly change the activity .
A further deletion of the promoter region from -54 to -44 , however , caused a markedly decreased activity .
Essentially similar results were obtained when H4IIE cells , a rat hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line , were used instead of NIH3T3 cells in the transfection assay ( data not shown ) .
These findings suggest that there may be a hitherto unrecognized regulatory element in the region between -54 and -44 .
To investigate this question , various constructs in which point mutations were inserted into this region were generated and transfected into NIH3T3 cells .
Nucleotide substitutions at -49 and -48 ( p49m ) and at -42 and -41 ( p42m ) resulted in a moderate decrease in the reporter activity ( ~60 % compared with that of p79 ) ( Fig 4A ) .
In contrast , mutation insertions at -47 and -46 ( p47m ) and at -45 and -44 ( p45m ) resulted in a marked decrease in the reporter activity ( to > ~20 % and ~30 % of that represented by p79 , respectively ) , while mutations at -51 and -50 had no effect ( Fig 4A ) .
These results indicate that the nucleotide sequence , GGACTACAG , which we termed CPRE , is essential for the promoter function in NIH3T3 cells .
The removal of a region between -44 and -2 , which contained an SP-l-like element , CTCCCGCCAG , resulted in a further decrease in the promoter activity ( Fig 3 ) .
The importance of the SP-1-like element for the promoter activity was substantiated by the finding that p79Sm , a mutated p79 , had a significantly decreased reporter activity ( ~60 % compared with the wild-type p79 ) ( Fig 4B ) .
p798 Xm , double mutations in the CPRE , and the SP-1-like element depressed the promoter activity more than did p79Xm , and p79Sm , a single mutation construct of CPRE and SP-1-like element , respectively ( Fig 4B ) .
These findings indicate that CPRE at -49/-41 is essential for the promoter activity , and that the SP-1l-like element at -21/-12 also additionally contributes to the promoter function .

The putative cis-acting GATA , CACCC , and SP-1-like elements are boxed and underlined .
The initiating codon is show n in bold and underlined .
The intronic sequence is expressed in lowercase letters .
shown in Fig 5 , p946 conferred a 70-fold higher transcription of the reporter gene compared with pGL3Basic , a promoter-less luciferase reporter construct .
Treatment with DMSO , a potent inducer of erythroid differentiation of MEL cells , elicited a significant increase in luciferase activity ( Fig 5 ) , while the same treatment had no effect on the activity in NIH3T3 cells ( data not shown ) .
These findings indicate that the promoter activity is 946 3439 increased during erythroid differentiation of MEL cells , but not in nonerythroid cells such as NIH3T3 cells .
The levels of both basal and DMSO-induced luciferase activities remained unaffected by the removal of a sequence between -946 and -54 , which contains 12 GATA sites and four CACCC elements .
Further deletion from -54 to -44 , however , resulted in a significant decrease both in the basal and in DMSO-induced luciferase activities , and the removal of a sequence between -44 and -2 caused a further loss of activity ( Fig 5 ) .
These results suggest that CPRE at -49/-41 and the SP-1-like element at -21/-12 may also be important for the promoter activity in MEL cells .
Because our previous studies showed that a GATA site near the SP-1-like element may be involved in the human CPO gene upregulation , '' '' this question was examined in detail .
For this purpose , various mutated constructs containing nucleotide substitutions were generated from p79 , transfected into MEL cells , and luciferase activities were determined ( Fig 6A ) .
A mutation in the GATA site ( p79Gm ) had no effect on the promoter activity , although it abrogated formation of the specific DNA-protein complex ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , a mutation in the CPRE ( p79Xm ) decreased luciferase activity ( > 60 % of that generated by the wild-type p79 ) , and inhibition was markedly pronounced when the GATA site was also mutated .
p79Sm , a mutation in the SP-1-like element alone , significantly decreased the activity , which was similar to those observed with p79GSm and p79SXm , a second mutation in the GATA site , and CPRE , respectively .
These results indicate that the SP-1-like element is essential for basic expression , but not sufficient for full activation of the promoter , and that there may be synergistic regulation of the promoter function among these elements in erythroid cells .
The role of the three regulatory elements was then examined during erythroid cell differentiation of MEL cells by DMSO treatment .
p79GXm and p79GSm , which did not contain GATA , but contained the SP-1-like element and CPRE , respectively , demonstrated only a slight increase in luciferase activity after DMSO treatment .
In contrast , p79SXm , which contained the GATA site , but not SP-1-like element and CPRE , showed a twofold increase in the luciferase activity as compared with that by p79 ( Fig 6B ) .
These results indicate that the GATA site at -59/-54 plays also a significant role in DMSO-mediated +58 Relative luciferase activity Fig 3 .

( A ) Identification of CPRE by functional assays in NIH3T3 cells .
The effects of nucleotide transversions in the region between -51 and -40 were ex-amined .
The results are expressed as the ratios of luciferase activities to that obtained with a pGL3-Basic plasmid .
Data are the means of triplicate deter-minations .
( B ) Various constructs with the indicated mutations were transfected into NIH3T3 o induction of the promoter activity , consistent with our earlier finding in human CPO gene promoter activity . '' ''
A specific DNA-protein complex is formed at CPRE at -49/-41 in both MEL and NIH3T3 cells .
- Our results demonstrated that CPRE plays a critical role in mouse CPO promoter function both in erythroid and in nonerythroid cells .
To identify nuclear proteins that bind to this element , gel mobility shift assays were performed using a CPRE double-stranded oligo-mer .
When the radiolabeled oligomer was incubated with nuclear extracts from MEL cells , a single major retarded band was found ( Fig 7 , lane 1 ) .
This band disappeared by the addition of a 125-fold molar excess of the unlabelled CPRE ( Fig 7 , lane 2 ) , while the addition of CPREm , a mutated CPRE oligomer , had no effect ( Fig 7 , lane 3 ) .
A single band with a similar gel retardation property was also observed when nuclear extracts from NIH3T3 cells were used ( Fig 7 lane 4 and 6 ) , indicating that there may be a common element between erythroid and nonerythroid cells , which may be recognized by their nuclear proteins .

The GATA site at -59/- 54 is recognized by GATA-1 in MEL cells .
- Our studies show that GATA site at -59/-54 is also important for the CPO promoter function ( Fig 6A and B ) .
Because GATA-1 is known to be abundantly expressed in MEL cells , '' '' it is possible that GATA-1 may contribute to the CPO promoter function via binding to GATA site ( s ) .
Gel retardation assays showed that there is a single major retardation band by the addition of an oligomer corresponding to the GATA site ( -59/-54 ) , and that it disappeared by the addition of a 250-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligomer , or an oligomer containing the GATA consensus sequence ( Fig 8 , lane 3 and 4 ) .
Furthermore , addition of anti-GATA-1 antibody entirely super-shifted this band ( Fig 8 , lane 6 ) .

While this finding seems paradoxical , it is consistent with a previous report , which showed that GATA-1 mRNA level was transiently decreased after DMSO treatment , but recovered with time . ''
Thus , it is possible that GATA-1 may become transiently either active , or an interaction between GATA-1 and other nuclear proteins may be induced by DMSO treatment .
SP-1 does not bind to the SP-1-like element ( -21/-12 ) in MEL and NIH3T3 cells .
The SP-l1-like element at -21/-12 was also shown to be important for the promoter function both in MEL and NIH3T3 cells , which also functions synergistically with GATA-1 and CPRE binding proteins in MEL cells ( Fig 6A ) .
As shown in Fig 9 , when a nuclear extract prepared from MEL cells was incubated with the radiolabeled oligomer containing the SP-1-like element , a single retarded band that migrated faster than that with SP-1 was observed ( Fig 9 , lane 1 ) .
This band could not be competed by the addition of a cold oligomer containing SP-1 consensus sequence ( Fig 9 , lane 3 ) .
This was not due to a difference in the affinity of SP-1 for these elements , as the band representing SP-1 was not suppressed by the addition of an excess amount of the cold oligomer containing an SP-l-like element ( Fig 9 , lane 6 ) .
Furthermore , the addition of anti-SP-1 antibody had no effect on the migration of the band ( data not shown ) , indicating that the nuclear protein ( s ) , which forms a complex with SP-1 is different from that which forms a complex with the SP-l-like element .
A specific DNA-protein complex was also formed when a nuclear extract from NIH3T3 cells was used .
It migrated similarly as did the SP-1-DNA complex , but its formation was not inhibited by the addition of an excess amount of the cold oligomer corresponding to the SP-1 consensus sequence ( Fig 9 , lane 11 ) .
These results indicate , as in the case with MEL cells , that SP-1 also does not bind to this element in NIH3T3 cells .
It should also be noted that there is difference in the migration of bands between MEL and NIH3T3 cells , suggesting that different factors may bind to the SP-1-like element in each type of cells .

MEL SP 1like SP tlike TAKAHASHI ET AL DISCUSSION In this study , we examined the regulatory mechanism of the mouse CPO gene expression in erythroid and nonerythroid cells .
We first examined the structure of the mouse CPO gene and identified that the mouse CPO gene structure is highly similar to the human CPO gene .
Namely , the 5'-upstream region of the mouse CPO gene contains several putative cis-regulatory elements including GATA sites , CACCC sites , and SP-l-like element , just like the human CPO gene .
The spatial arrangement of these elements is also similar for both genes , '* '' '' suggesting that CPO gene expression may be regulated in a similar manner between mice and humans .
By examining the mouse CPO gene promoter function , we identified a novel regulatory element ( GGACTACAG , termed CPRE ) that is involved in the induction of luciferase activity in NIH3T3 cells , whereas an SP-1-like element at -21/-12 was also required for maximal promoter activity in DMSO-induced MEL cells ( Fig 4B and 6A ) .
Disruption of CPRE resulted in a marked decrease in the promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells , while it decreased the promoter activity only moderately in MEL cells ( Fig 4B and 6A ) , suggesting a different role of CPRE between erythroid and nonerythroid cells .
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that a specific DNA-protein complex was formed at CPRE both in MEL and NIH3T3 cells ( Fig 7 ) .
Our search in the GenBank database showed that CPRE is also present in the human B-globin gene promoter , '' and CPRE-related sequences are also found in genes of several heme biosynthetic enzymes , such as uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase , '' CPO , !
**° rat ALAS-N , * '' and in the erythroid and nonerythroid mouse PBGD ' !
*** ( Table 2 ) .
A CPRE-related sequence is also present in the human ALAS-E ( our unpublished data ) .
It is unclear at present whether these sequences are functional or not , but it is possible that CPRE-binding factor ( s ) may contribute to heme synthesis by exerting its effect on gene expression of these enzymes .
Identification of the factor ( s ) that interacts with this element may therefore be important for better understanding of tissue-specific regulation of heme pathway genes .

REGULATION OF MOUSE CPO GENE EXPRESSION Our previous studies showed that an SP-1 site adjacent to the GATA sequence in the human CPO gene contributes to basic gene expression in MEL cells . '' ''
Therefore , we suspected that an SP-1-like element at -21/-12 in the mouse CPO gene may also be involved in the promoter function .
Indeed , its disruption resulted in a moderate decrease in the promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells , indicating its contribution ( Fig 4B ) .
In MEL cells , the SP-1-like element alone , however , demonstrated only a very low activity , but its combination with CPRE or GATA site ( -59/-54 ) markedly enhanced the promoter activity ( Fig 6B ) .
Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that this element may be recognized by different nuclear factors between MEL and NIH3T3 cells ( Fig 9 ) , suggesting that transcriptional regulation by SP-l-like element may be different between erythroid and nonerythroid cells .
A similar GC-rich element also exists in the proximal promoter region of human ferrochelatase gene . ''
Thus , there may be a role of this element in the expression of other heme biosynthetic enzymes , and this question should be clarified .
The GATA site at -59/-54 was shown to bind to GATA-1 , consistent with our previous findings for its role in human CPO gene expression ( Fig 8 ) . '' ''
Because GATA factors are key contributors to the differentiation process of hematopoietic cells '' ? ''
and because GATA binding sites have been widely found in the gene promoter of several heme synthetic pathway enzymes , '' GATA-1 may also be essential for upregulation of the CPO gene during erythroid differentiation .
In the present study , the GATA site alone or in combination with CPRE , showed only a low reporter activity , while together with the SP-1-like element , it markedly stimulated the activity in MEL cells ( Fig 6A ) .
Synergistic effects of various combinations of transcription factors , including GATA-1 , on TATA-less promoters have been reported .
`` > '' Our results also suggest that interaction between GATA-1 and SP-1-like element-binding proteins , as well as CPRE and SP-l-like element-binding proteins may be important for CPO gene expression in erythroid cells .
GATA-1 significantly contributes to the DMSO-induced promoter activity in MEL cells ( Fig 6B ) .
On the other hand , the amount of GATA-1-DNA complex formed at the -59/-54 GATA site was slightly decreased by DMSO treatment of MEL cells ( Fig 8 ) .
DMSO treatment also did not increase the formation of DNA-protein complexes at CPRE and SP-l-like element ( data not shown ) .
Thus , GATA-1-mediated increase in Table 2 .

- Model of the differential regulation of the mouse CPO gene promoter function in erythroid and nonerythroid cells .
transactivation and a decrease in DNA binding in DMSO-treated MEL cells may seem paradoxical .
However , our findings are consistent with an earlier report , which showed that MEL cells contain two distinct GATA-binding proteins that have different patterns of expression during erythroid differentiation , and that GATA-1 mRNA levels decreased transiently during DMSO-induced differentiation . ''
One possible explanation may be that GATA-1 may become an active form by certain modification such as phosphorylation during erythroid differen-tiation . '' ''
Alternatively , DMSO treatment may induce interaction among transcription factors , resulting in the activation of the promoter function .
To account for tissue-specific regulation , we provide a hypothetical scheme for differential CPO regulation between erythroid and nonerythroid cells ( Fig 10 ) .
Namely , in erythroid cells , binding proteins to the SP-l-like element , CPRE and GATA-1 , cooperatively function in CPO gene expression .
In contrast , in nonerythroid cells , CPRE-binding protein by itself plays a principal role in basic expression , while GATA-1 plays little role and the SP-1-like element may exert only a moderate activity .
The tissue-specific regulation of CPO gene promoter function may also be influenced by differences in the affinity of tissue-specific factors to the SP-1-like element , Factor X and Y in MEL and NIH3T3 cells , respectively .
While the exact nature of the regulatory mechanism of CPO gene expression is yet to be clarified , this model should serve as a useful hypothesis for evaluation for tissue-specific regulation of heme biosynthetic enzymes .
