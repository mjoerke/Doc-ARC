We took advantage of our monoclonal model of germinal center B cell differentiation , IgM * IgD* CL-01 cells , to define the role of the ILy3 evolutionarily conserved sequence ( ECS ) in the germline transcriptional activation of the human Cy3 gene .
The 1y3 ECS lies upstream of the major I1y3 transcription initiation site and displays more than 90 % identity with the corresponding human Iy1 , Iy2 , and Iy4 regions .
Reporter luciferase gene vectors containing the human y3 ECS were used to transfect CL-01 cells , which have been shown to undergo Sm- > Sy3 DNA recombination , upon engagement of CD40 by CD40 ligand ( CD4O0L ) and exposure to IL-4 .
In these transfected CL-01 cells , €CD40 : CD40L engagement and exposure to IL-4 synergistically induced y3 ECS-dependent luciferase reporter gene activation .
Targeted mutational analysis demonstrated that a tandem NF-xB/Re ! l binding motif is critical for the y3 ECS responsiveness to both CD40L and IL-4 , while a STAT-6-binding site is additionally required for IL-4 inducibility .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that p50/p65/c-Rel and STAT-6 are effectively induced by CD4O0L and IL-4 , respectively , and bind to specific DNA motifs within the ECS .
These partially overlapping CD40L and IL-4 responsive elements are functionally cooperative as the disruption of one of them prevents synergistic promoter activation .
Thus , the y3 ECS is an inducible promoter containing cis elements that critically mediate CD4O0L and IL-4-triggered transcriptional activation of the human Cy3 gene .
lass switching modulates the biological effector functions of Igs and contributes to the maturation of the Ab re sponse ( reviewed in Refs .
1 and 2 ) .
The substitution of the Ig heavy chain constant region in the primary response with a Cy , Ca , or Ce region in the secondary response is critical for the efficient clearance of Ag by conferring to Abs the ability to enter the extravascular space , being secreted across digestive or respiratory surfaces , and interact with phagocytic , histamine-releasing , and cytotoxic effector cells .
Ig class switching is effected by deletional DNA recombination between switch ( S ) '' regions located 5 ' of each C ; , gene ( 3-6 ) .
Switching to a given downstream CJ gene is preceded by transcription of the targeted gene in the form of an intermediate RNA encompassing a noncoding exon , called *Division of Molecular Immunology , Department of Pathology , Weill Medical College of Cornell University , and *The Immunology Program , Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University , New York , NY 10021 Received for publication September 15 , 1998 .

Splicing of the intermediate I ; , -S ; , -C , , RNA juxtaposes the I , , with the C ; ; exon and leads to the formation of I ; ; -C ; RNA ( germline transcript ) , which is thought to be critical for S DNA recombination by increasing the recombinogenic activity of the S region and/or its accessibility to the S recombinase machinery ( 12 ) .
CD40 engagement by CD40 ligand ( CD4O0L , CD154 ) critically triggers Ig class switching ( 13-15 ) .
Patients lacking an intact CD40L gene display elevated serum IgM and no secondary IgG , IgA , and IgE isotypes ( hyperIgM syndrome ) ( 16 ) .
As we have shown , upon CD40 engagement by CD4O0L , human B cells express germline Iy-Cy , and transcripts , and eventually undergo Su- Su-Sal , and Su- DNA recombination , which is mediated by ( endogenous ) TGF-B secreted by the CD4O-induced B cells ( 13-15 ) .
As we have also shown , switch DNA recombination to §y3 , Sy2 , Sy4 , or Se requires IL-4 , possibly due to its synergistic effect on the CD4O-induced transcription of the corresponding germline genes ( 13-15 ) .
Studies in murine B cell lines have suggested that the germline transcription of the Cy1 and the Ce genes is associated with the nuclear translocation of NF- « B/Rel and STAT-6 , which bind to highly conserved cis promoter elements located upstream of the Iyl and Ie regions ( 17-20 ) .
The importance of these transcription factors in the regulation of Ig class switching has been further suggested by findings showing the reduced ability of B cells from mice genetically deficient in p50 , c-Rel , or STAT-6 protein to switch to IgG1 , or IgE , upon appropriate stimulation in vivo or in vitro ( 21-24 ) .
Reporter assays utilizing human DG75 , DND39 , Raji , and SDL-M1 cell lines have led to the identification of the human germline Ce , Cal , and Ca2 gene promoters and to the delineation of their respective IL-4 or TGF- responsive elements ( REs ) ( 25-31 ) .
However , distinct CD40 REs within these promoters have not 0022-1767/99/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 5328 been defined , and their corresponding CD4O0-induced frans-factors have not been identified .
The utilization of SSK41 cells has allowed the identification of a PMA- and IL-4-inducible DNA fragment upstream of the major human I1y3-Cy3 transcriptional initiation site , but PMA is not a switch-inducing stimulus , and PMA and IL-4 REs were not defined within the tested DNA region ( 32 ) .
Furthermore , since none of the above human cell lines can be induced to undergo switch DNA recombination , the above studies could not address the correlation between the transcriptional potential of the tested C , , gene promoters and the induction of switch DNA recombination , thereby failing to provide information on the CD40 and cytokine-dependent transcriptional regulation of the human Cy genes .
The identification of germline Cy gene promoters would require the availability of a B cell line that is readily trans-fectable and that can undergo IgG switching in response to physiological stimuli , that is , CD4OL : CDA4O engagement and exposure to appropriate cytokines .
Previous studies have shown that sequences lying upstream of Sy regions show a high degree of conservation among all four human Cy isotypes and are highly homologous ( 65 % ) within a 175-bp region to the corresponding sequence of the mouse Cy promoters ( evolutionarily conserved sequence , ECS ) ( 6 , 9 ) .
Based on these observations , the human ECS-Iy regions have been hypothesized to regulate the transcriptional activation of the corresponding germline Cy genes ( 6 , 9 ) .
In this study , we have taken advantage of IgM * IgD* CL-O01 cells , our recently identified human monoclonal model of Ig class switching , germinal center ( GC ) differentiation ( 13-15 ) , and somatic hypermutation ( 33 ) , to address the functionality of the ECS lying upstream of the human Cy3 gene .
Upon CD40L : CD40 engagement and exposure to IL-4 , CL-O1 cells initiate germline I1y3-Cy3 transcription and undergo Su-Sy3 DNA recombination .
By transient luciferase gene reporter assays , we demonstrate that a DNA fragment encompassing the ECS and the major [ y3 transcriptional initiation site is a functional promoter .
This ECS is synergistically induced by CD4OL and IL-4 through the induction of NF- « B/Re !
and STAT-6 proteins and their binding to functionally cooperative CD4OL and IL-4 responsive cis regulatory elements .
Materials and Methods B cells The human monoclonal IgM * IgD* CL-01 cell line has been described ( 13-15 ) .
Tonsillar B cells were separated by Ficoll gradient and rosetting with 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide-treated SRBCs ( 15 ) .
Nonroset-ting cells were reacted with a FITC-conjugated mouse mAb to human IgD ( Southern Biotechnology Associates , Birmingham , AL ) and then with anti-FITC®** '' ** ' Microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotech , Auburn , CA ) to positively select sIgD* B cells using the MiniMACS magnetic sorter ( Miltenyi Bio-tech ) .
Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 % heat inactivated FBS ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin , and 100 pg/ml streptomycin .
Human trimeric CD4O0L leucine-zipper fusion protein ( htCD4OL ) ( Immunex , Se-attle , WA ) was used at 1 pg/ml .
Recombinant human IL-4 ( Schering Plough , Kenilworth , NJ ) was used at 500 U/ml .
The higher amount of IL-4 as compared with previous experiments ( 13-15 ) was necessary to optimize the IL-4-dependent response in transfected B cells .
PCR amplification of Iy3-Cy3 , V , ,DJ , ,Cy3 , and B-actin cDNA transcripts RNA was isolated from 3 X 10° CL-O1 or purified tonsillar B cells using the RNeasy Total RNA Kit ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , CA ) and then reverse transcribed using the Superscript Preamplification System for first strand cDNA synthesis ( Life Technologies ) .
1y3-Cy3 , V ; , DJ , ,-Cy3 , and B-actin transcript cDNAs were PCR amplified for 25 cycles as described ( 13 , 15 ) .
HUMAN ECS-Iy3 IS A FUNCTIONAL GENE PROMOTER Luciferase reporter vectors pGL3-Basic , pGL3-Promoter , and pRL-CMV reporter vectors were from Promega ( Madison , WI ) .
The -449/+265 ECS-Iy3 DNA fragment was PCR amplified from the HindII/BamHI subclone of the 5 ' human S $ y3 region ( GenBank Accession No .
$ 79588 ) ( 6 ) using primers with 5 ' overhangs containing KpnI ( sense ) and Bg/lI ( antisense ) sites .
Digested PCR products were cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector .
The -352/+265 , -239/ +265 , -157/+265 , and -42/+265 5 '' progressive deletional mutants of the ECS-Iy3 sequence were PCR amplified using appropriate sense primers with 5 '' KpnI and antisense primers with Bg/lI site overhangs .
Site-directed mutants were generated by ligating 5 ' and 3 ' PCR fragments flanking the targeted motifs .
The 5 ' and 3 ' DNA fragments were amplified using appropriate primers with 5 ' overhangs containing KprI ( sense ) /SacI ( antisense ) and Sac !

The amplified 5 ' and 3 ' DNA fragments were digested with Kprl/Sacl , and Sacl/BgIl , respectively , and cloned into the Kpnl/BgllI-digested pGL-3-Basic vector .
This strategy disrupted the targeted motif by replacing 6 nucleotides of the wild-type ( wt ) sequence with a Sacl restriction site .
The kB3~ « B4~ mutant was generated by amplifying the 5° and 3 ' fragments from the kB3~ -449/+265 ECS-Iy3 pGL3 construct .

Transfection and dual luciferase assay CL-01 cells ( 8 X 10° ) in 500 ul RPMI-FBS were mixed with 40 ul TE ( 50 mM Tris , 10 mM EDTA ) solution containing 20 ug of pGL3 reporter construct and 10 ng of pRL-CMV control vector .
Electroporation was performed at 725 V/cm and 950 uF using a Gene Pulser II apparatus ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) .
Each transfection was performed in duplicate .
After electroporation , cells were resuspended in complete medium ( 2 X 10®/ml ) , split into aliquots , and cultured in the presence or absence of IL-4 ( 500 U/ml ) and/or htCD4O0L ( 1 pg/ml ) .
After 24 h , firefly and ranilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Assay System ( Promega ) to assess promoter activity and transfection efficiency , respectively .
All measures were corrected by subtracting the baseline activity of lysates from nontransfected cells .
Nuclear extract preparation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays CL-O01 ( 5 X 10° ) or purified tonsillar ( 10 ' ) B cells were cultured in the presence of appropriate stimuli for 12 h and then lysed to extract nuclear proteins according to a modified small scale extraction method ( 20 ) .
Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) was performed to determine protein concentration .
Double stranded oligonucleotides ( consensus sequences are underlined ) overlapping the « B3 ( residues -236 to -216 , GTGTCTGGACTC CCCCTCGCC ) , or the GAS ( residues -96 to -69 , GAGCTGTGATT TCCTAGGAAGACAAA ) sites were end labeled with [ y-* P ] ATP by T4 kinase and used at approximately 30,000 cpm in each electrophoretic mobility shift analysis ( EMSA ) reaction .

The reaction samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then electrophoresed through a 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 % Tris-borate EDTA buffer at 150 V. In competition , inhibition , and supershift experiments , nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with specific Abs or competing oligonucleotides before addition of the radiolabeled probe .
Rabbit Abs to human NF- « B p50 , p52 , p65 , c-Rel , Rel B , STAT-3 , STAT-5 , and STAT-6 proteins were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( San Diego , CA ) and were used in the amount of 1 pl for a 20-pl reaction .

Expression of germline I1y3-Cy3 and mature transcripts by Ig M* IgD* CL-01 and normal naive Ig M* IgD* B cells .
CL-01 and naive B cells were incubated in medium only , or in medium containing htCD40L ( 1 pg/ml ) , IL-4 ( 500 U/ml ) , or both htCD40L and IL-4 .
cDNAs from cells cultured for 2 or 5 days were used as templates to PCR amplify 1y3-Cy3 ( 670-bp ) and V , ; , DJ , -Cy3 ( 416-bp ) transcripts , respectively .
B-Actin cDNA was amplified as control .
Amplified cDNAs were fractionated through a 1 % ethidium bromide agarose gel .
The findings depicted here were obtained from one of three independent experiments yielding similar results .
Results Human IgM* IgD ' B cells express germline Iy3-Cy3 and productive V , ,DJ , ,Cy3 transcripts upon incubation with CD4OL and IL-4 To verify the relative contribution of CD4OL and IL-4 to the in duction of switching to Cy3 , IgM * IgD* CL-O1 cells and purified IgM * IgD* tonsillar B cells were cultured in medium alone or in A Hind IIl Stu I BamH I & P 5329 medium containing htCD40L ( 1 pug/m !
) , IL-4 ( 500 U/ml ) , or both htCD40L and IL-4 .
cDNAs from cells cultured for 2 and 5 days were used as templates to PCR amplify germline I1y3-Cy3 ( 670 bp ) and productive V , ,DJ , ,-Cy3 ( 416 bp ) transcripts , respectively .
The specificity of the amplified cDNAs was verified by restriction digestion and sequencing ( 13 ) .
B cells in medium alone failed to express germline 1y3-Cy3 and productive V , ,DJ , ,-Cy3 transcripts .
htCD40L or IL-4 alone were sufficient to initiate 1y3-Cy3 transcription , but not switch DNA recombination to Cy3 , as V , ,DJ , ,Cy3 transcripts were not detected ( Fig .
1 ) .
However , in agreement with our previous findings , the combination of htCD4OL and IL-4 synergistically up-regulated the expression of germline I1y3-Cy3 transcripts and induced related DNA recombination , as indicated by the detection of both V , ,DJ , ,-Cy3 transcripts ( Fig .
1 ) and Sy3-Sp switch circles ( not shown ) .
Thus , in human B cells , exposure to CD4O0L or IL-4 is sufficient to induce Cy3 germline transcription , but switching to Cy3 requires both CD4OL and IL-4 .
The human ECS-Iy3 sequence upstream of Sy3 contains putative CD4OL and IL-4 REs Previous studies have shown that the regulation of the mouse Cy1 and the mouse and the human Ce gene promoters are highly dependent on binding sites for C/EBP , BSAP , and STAT-6 ( NF-IL-4 ) transcription factors ( 17 , 19 , 20 , 28 , 34 , 35 ) .
The ECS-Iy sequences upstream of the human Sy regions show a high degree of conservation among all four Cy isotypes and are highly homologous in the ECS region to the mouse Cy promoters ( 6 , 9 ) .
An analysis of the human ECS-Iy3 sequence ( Fig .
24 ) allowed us to identify putative binding sites for the following transcription factors , from 5 ' to 3 ' : six kB ( « B1 to < B6 ) , a C/EBP , a BSAP , and a GAS site ( Fig .

Inducibility of the human ECS-Iy3 region by htCD40L and/or IL-4 .
CL-01 cells were transfected with either the empty pGL-3-Basic vector ( 20 ug ) or the ECS-Iy3-pGL-3 vector ( 20 ug ) .
pRL-CMV control plasmid ( 10 ng ) was cotransfected with the reporter constructs to normalize the transfection efficiency .
Transfected CL-01 cells were cultured in medium only , or in medium containing htCD40L , IL-4 , or both htCD40L and IL-4 , and the luciferase gene activity was assessed after 24 h. Data are expressed as relative light units normalized to a cotransfected pRL-CMV control plasmid ( A ) , and as fold induction ( B ) , i.e. , ratio of the luciferase activity of extracts from induced cells compared with that of extracts from cells incubated in medium only .
Results represent the mean + SD of three independent transfection experiments .
and « B5 ) within the Cy3 ECS are collinear with the CD40 RE of the mouse Cy1 promoter ( 19 ) .
The palindromic GAS site , also located within the ECS , contains a core spacer similar to that of the IL-4 RE of the human Ce and CD23 gene promoters ( 25 , 26 , 36 ) .
The ECS-Iy3 region is a functional promoter that is synergistically induced by CD4OL and IL-4 The CD4O0L and IL-4-dependent inducibility of a 714-bp DNA fragment encompassing the ECS , as well as the major 1y3 transcriptional initiation site ( ECS-I [ y3 region , residues -449 to +265 ) ( Fig .
2B ) , was tested in luciferase reporter assays after insertion of this DNA fragment into the pGL3 vector , and transient transfection of CL-O01 cells ( Fig .
3 ) .
ECS-Iy3-pGL-3-transfected CL-O1 cells were cultured in medium alone or in medium containing htCD4O0L ( 1 pg/m ! 1 ) , IL-4 ( 500 U/m1 ) , or both htCD4OL and IL-4 .
After 24 h , the luciferase activity was measured .
Upon exposure to htCD40L or IL-4 , luciferase activity was induced in CL-O1 cells transfected with the ECS-Iy3-pGL3 , but not the pGL3-Basic vector ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) .
This induction was synergistically enhanced by the combination of htCD4OL and IL-4 .
Interestingly , the ECS-1y3-pGL3 construct displayed a basal activity lower than that associated with the empty pGL3-Basic vector ( Fig .
3A ) , suggesting that the tested DNA fragment contains a potent silencer region .
Thus , the human ECS-Iy3 region possesses a tran-scription-promoting activity that is inducible by either CD4OL or IL-4 and that is synergistically enhanced by the combination of CD40L and IL-4 .
The -239/-157 ECS is critical in conferring both CD4OL and IL-4-dependent transcriptional inducibility to the ECS-Iy3 region To narrow down the portion of the ECS-Iy3 region involved in the CD40L and IL-4 inducibility , 5 ' progressive D1 , D2 , D3 , and D4 ECS-Iy3 deletion mutants were generated by taking into consideration the distribution of the putative « B , BSAP , and GAS sites ( Figs .
2B and 4 ) .
These deletion mutants were separately inserted into pGL3 vectors that were used to transfect CL-O1 cells .
Transfected CL-O1 cells were incubated in medium only , or in medium containing htCD4O0L , IL-4 , or both , and luciferase activity was measured 24 h later .
Notably , while the D1 and D2 mutants displayed a basal reporter activity comparable to that associated with the ECS-Iy3-pGL3 construct , the D3 and D4 mutants displayed a 3.9-fold lower and a 4.5-fold higher basal reporter activity , respectively ( Fig .
4 ) , suggesting that , while the -239/-157 ECS fragment is critical in conferring basal transcriptional activity to the ECS-Iy3 sequence , the -157/-65 ECS fragment contains a silencer element .
When compared with the wt ECS-Iy3 region , the D1 and D2 mutants retained full htCD4OL- or IL-4-dependent inducibility but showed significantly reduced synergistic responsiveness to the combined htCD40L and IL-4 stimulation ( Fig .
4 ) .
The D3 and D4 mutants , which lacked the 5 ' half or the whole ECS , did not respond to either htCD4O0L , IL-4 , or both htCD40L and IL-4 .
All together , these data suggest that the -239 to -157 region of the ECS is crucial to confer both CD4O0L and IL-4-dependent transcriptional inducibility to the ECS-Iy3 sequence and that elements located upstream of the ECS ( residues -449 to -352 ) are necessary for a full synergistic response to CD4OL and IL-4 .
Identification of the CD4OL and IL-4 REs within the ECS-Iy3 region To identify the CD4OL and the IL-4 responsive cis regulatory elements within the ECS , we generated ECS-Iy3 ( residues -449 to +265 ) mutants bearing mutated « B3 ( « B3 ) , « B4 ( « B4 ) , ISRE/ kB5/C/EBP ( ISRE /kB5 ° /C/EBP ) , « B3/kB4 ( « B3 /kB4~ ) , BSAP C ) , or GAS ( GAST ) sites ( Fig .
5A ) .
CL-O1 cells were transfected with the wt or mutated ECS-Iy3-pGL3 constructs , and incubated in medium only , or in medium containing htCD40L , IL-4 , or both .
Luciferase activity was measured after 24 h. The basal reporter activity of « B3 , ISRE /kB5 /C/EBP_ , BSAP , or GAS_ mutated constructs was comparable to that of the wt ECS-Iy3 construct ( Fig .
5B , left panel ) .
In contrast , the « B4~ and the « B3 /kB4~ mutants displayed a 4-fold lower basal transcriptional activity as compared with that associated with the wt ECS-Iy3 sequence , indicating that the « B4 site is critical for the basal promoter activity .

5B , second right panel ) .
The virtual abrogation of the IL-4 inducibility in the GAS~ and « B3 / xB4~ mutants , but not in the ISRE /kB5 /C/EBP , and BSAP_ mutants , suggested that the IL-4 RE encompasses the GAS site as well as the « B3 and « B4 elements within the ECS-Iy3 region .
As expected , the B3 , the « B3 /kB4 , or the GAS _ , but not the ISRE~-/kB5 - /C/EBP_ or BSAP_ mutants displayed a complete loss of the synergistic activation elicited by the combination of htCD40L and IL-4 ( Fig .
5B , right panel ) .
Mutations disrupting the BSAP binding consensus element reduced the synergistic inducibility by about 50 % .
By demonstrating that the CD40 RE consists of the « B3 and « B4 sites and that the IL-4 RE encompasses not only the GAS , but also the « B3/xB4 sites , these experiments define partially overlapping CD40 and IL-4 REs within the ECS-Iy3 .
The BSAP binding consensus element enhances the IL-4 and CD40L plus IL-4-induced , but not the CD4O0L-induced , activation of the ECS-Iy3 sequence .
The isolated ECS fragment is sufficient to confer CD4OL and IL-4 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter To verify the principal function of the « B3 , « B4 , BSAP , and GAS sites within the Cy3 ECS , we compared the ability of the wt , « B3 /kB4 , BSAP_ , and GAS_- ECS fragments to confer CD40L and/or IL-4 inducibility to the SV40 minimal promoter-driven reporter construct ( Fig .
6 ) .
An SV40-pGL3 reporter construct lacking the ECS was used as a control .
CL-O1 cells were independently transfected with each of these constructs and incu- bated in medium alone , or in medium containing htCD4O0L , IL-4 , or both .
The luciferase activity was measured after 24 h and expressed as relative light units ( Fig .
6 , left panel ) , and as fold induction ( Fig .
6 , right panel ) .
The basal reporter activities displayed by the « B3 /kB4~ , BSAP_ , and GAS~ ECS mutant constructs were comparable to that of the wt ECS-SV40-pGL3 minimal promoter construct , which was significantly induced by either htCD40L or IL-4 ( Fig .
6 , left and right panels ) .
As expected , the « B3 /kB4~ ECS mutant was not responsive to htCD40L and/or IL-4 , whereas the GAS~ ECS mutant lost IL-4 but retained htCD40L-dependent inducibility .
The CD40L-mediated inducibility of the BSAP_ ECS fragment was comparable to that of the wt ECS construct but consistently showed decreased IL-4 responsiveness ( 1.5- vs 2.6-fold induction ) .
Finally , while the wt ECS fragment was able to mediate synergistic reporter activation by CD4OL and IL-4 , the « B3_/kB4~ or GAS~ ECS mutants were not , and the BSAP_ ECS mutant displayed about 50 % reduction .
These experiments demonstrate that the isolated ECS fragment is sufficient to confer CD4OL and IL-4 inducibility to a heterologous promoter and further verify the cis-element composition of the CD40 and IL-4 REs within the Cy3 ECS .
NF- « B/Rel and STAT-6 proteins are induced by CD40 and IL-4 , respectively , and bind to their respective REs within the human ECS-Iy3 region NF- « B/Rel !
and STAT-6 transcription factors have been shown to bind to the CD40 and IL-4 REs of the mouse Cy1 and Ce genes ( 17-20 , 35 ) .
Appropriate EMSAs were performed to verify whether these proteins can be induced by htCD40L and/or IL-4 and bind to the CD40 and IL-4 REs of the human ECS-Iy3 region .

- EMSA analysis of nucleoprotein complexes binding to the « B3 and GAS sites of the CD40 and IL-4 REs within the ECS .
CL-O1 and normal naive B cells were incubated in medium only , or in medium containing htCD40L , IL-4 , or both htCD40L and IL-4 for 12 h. Nuclear extracts were first incubated for 15 min with radiolabeled oligonucleotides encompassing the ECS « B3 site ( A ) or the GAS site ( B ) , and subsequently fractionated into a 6 % polyacrylamide gel ( lanes 2 to 9 ; lane 1 contains the protein-free probe ) .
The specificity of shifted bands and their identity to NF- « B ( complexes A , B , and C ) or STAT-6 were established by preincubating nuclear proteins with competitors , as detailed in the text ( Janes 11 to 13 ) .
The immunoreactivity of the shifted bands was determined by preincubating nuclear proteins with blocking Abs to human p50 , p52 , p65 , c-Rel , and Rel B proteins ( A , lanes 15 to 19 ) , or with supershifting Abs to human STAT-3 , STAT-5 , and STAT-6 proteins ( B , lanes 15 to 17 ) .
An Ab to human thyroglobulin was used as control ( A and B , lanes 14 ) .
greatly increased the intensity of complexes A , B , and C ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Addition of IL-4 to htCD4O0L further enhanced the htCD40L-induced « B3-binding activity ( Zane 5 ) .
Nuclear extracts from naive B cells cultured under the above conditions displayed similar « B3-binding and induction patterns , with a somewhat more pronounced formation of complex C following htCD4O0L and IL-4 stimulation ( Zanes 6-9 ) .
The htCD4O0L-induced binding to the radiolabeled B3 probe was specific , as it was inhibited by a `` cold '' wt « B3 oligonucleotide ( lanes 10 and 17 ) .
It was also inhibited by a wt consensus NF-KB binding site from the Ig x promoter ( lane 12 ) , but not by a mutated form of the latter ( lane 13 ) , indicating that complexes A , B , and C contain NF- « B/Re !
proteins .
To identify the composition of these complexes , htCD40L-induced nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min with Abs to human thyroglobulin ( control ) , as well as human p65 , p50 , p52 , c-Rel , and Rel B proteins .
Complex A was inhibited by Abs to p50 and p65 ; complex B by Abs to p50 and c-Rel ; and complex C only by Ab to p50 ; none of the complexes were inhibited by the control Ab or by Abs to p52 or Rel B ( Zanes 14-19 ) .
When the « B4 sequence was utilized as a probe , DNA binding complexes with similar elec- trophoretic mobility were detected ( data not shown ) .
Thus , CD40 engagement induces the binding of p50/p65 , p50/c-Rel , and p50/ p50 NF- « B/Rel complexes to the CD40 RE of the human ECS-Iy3 region .
The CD4O0-dependent induction of these complexes and their specific DNA binding are enhanced by IL-4 .
Nuclear proteins from unstimulated or htCD4O0L-induced CL-O1 cells did not show any specific binding to the GAS probe ( Fig .
78 , lanes 2 and 3 ) ; incubation of CL-O1 cells with IL-4 induced a slowly migrating band that was slightly enhanced by costimulation with htCD40L ( Zanes 4 and 5 ) .
Similar DNA binding patterns were reproduced using nuclear extracts from freshly isolated B cells in identical experimental conditions ( Zanes 6 to 9 ) .
The IL-4-induced DNA-protein complex was specific , as it was cleared by a nonla-beled I1y3 GAS oligo ( lane 11 ) .
A wt STAT-6-binding oligonu-cleotide , but not a nonfunctional mutant derived from the human Ce promoter , inhibited the IL-4-induced band shift , indicating that the IL-4-induced complex contained STAT-6 ( Zanes 12 and 13 ) .
Furthermore , preincubation of IL-4-induced nuclear proteins with Abs to human STAT-6 , but not thyroglobulin , STAT-3 , and STAT-5 proteins supershifted the IL-4-induced complex ( lanes 14 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; 5334 to 17 ) .
Thus , IL-4 induces STAT-6 binding to the GAS site of the IL-4 RE of the human Cy3 ECS , and this binding is enhanced by CD40 coengagement .
Discussion These studies show that the ECS upstream of the human Sy3 region is a promoter that is synergistically activated by CD4O0L and IL-4 through the induction of NF- « B/Re ! l and STAT-6 proteins .
They show that two tandem « B elements within the ECS are critical for the CD40-dependent promoter activation as they constitute the target of CD4OL-induced NE- « B/Rel transcription factors ( CD40 RE ) .
They define a canonical GAS site that , together with the CD4ORE , confers IL-4-dependent inducibility to the ECS , as it provides a specific target for the IL-4-induced STAT-6 ( IL-4 RE ) .
They demonstrate a BSAP binding site residing between the « B and GAS elements to be important for IL-4 , but not for CD4O0L-dependent inducibility .
Finally , they indicate that the partially overlapping organization of these CD40 and IL-4 REs is a critical structural feature for the synergistic promoter activation by enabling functional cooperation between NF- « B/Rel , BSAP , and STAT-6 binding sites .
In murine B cells , CD40 engagement , in the absence of additional stimuli , induces germline [ y1-Cy1 and Ie-Ce gene transcription through the activation of the corresponding promoters ( 19 , 20 ) .
This transcriptional inducibility is dependent on distinct CD40 REs composed of tandemly arrayed NF-KB binding sites .
Like-wise , human B cells stimulated through CD40 have been shown to express multiple I ; , -C , , germline transcripts , including 1y3-Cy3 ( 13 , 14 , 37 , 38 ) , but €CD40-induced activation of the corresponding C , , gene promoters has not been formally demonstrated , and the related CD40 REs have not been defined .
Here , we show that the CD40-dependent induction of germline I1y3-Cy3 transcription is associated with the transcriptional activation of the ECS-Iy3 promoter region via two tandem B sites ( B3 and B4 ) .
The sequence of these NF-KB binding sites and the intervening DNA are identical in all human Cy ECS regions ( 6 ) , suggesting that CD40 signaling is critical not only for 1y3-Cy3 , but also for Iy1-Cy1 , 1y2-Cy2 , and 1y4-Cy4 germline transcription .
Our experiments show that , upon CD40 triggering , p50/p65 , p50/c-Rel , and p50/p50 NF- « B/Re !
complexes bind to the « B3 site of the Cy3 CD40 RE .
This NF- « B binding pattern is reminiscent of that of the mouse Cy1 CD40 RE , which binds p50/Re !
B het-erodimers ( 19 ) .
While the probe used to analyze the NF-KB binding pattern of the mouse Cy1 CD40 RE encompassed three tandem xB sites ( collinear with our xB3 , « B4 , and « B5 sites ) , our probe spanned only the functionally dominant « B3 site .
We did not verify whether Rel B binds to the « B4 or « B5 sites or to a sequence spanning both xB3 and « B4 sites , but a recent report in murine B cells made genetically deficient in Rel B suggests that this NF- « B family member is not critical for the induction of germline Iy3-Cy3 transcription ( 39 ) .
As we show here , efficient activation of the ECS by CD40 ligation requires the presence of the two tandemly arrayed « B3 and « B4 sites .
Accordingly , targeted disruption of one of these sites partially reduces the ECS responsiveness to CD40 signaling , whereas disruption of both sites results in the complete loss of CD4O0-dependent inducibility .
In addition , oligonucleotides spanning the individual « B3 or « B4 motifs possess a weaker NF- « B/Rel-binding affinity than a composite oligonucleotide encompassing both the « B3 and the « B4 sites ( our unpublished observations ) , suggesting that the functional cooperation between the « B3 and the « B4 elements reflects the cooperative binding of NF- « B/Rel proteins to these sites .
HUMAN ECS-Iy3 IS A FUNCTIONAL GENE PROMOTER We speculate that the tandem organization of the relatively low affinity « B3 and « B4 sites enhances the trans-activational potential of the Cy3 CD40 RE by allowing dimer : dimer NF- « B/Re !
inter-actions .
Our data indicate that the B3 and « B4 motifs also possess distinct regulatory functions .
While the « B3 site is dominant over the « B4 site in mediating CD4O-triggered transcriptional activa-tion , the « B4 , but not the « B3 site , seems to be involved in the maintenance of the basal promoter activity .
These functional differences might stem from the different NF- « B/Rel composition on the « B3 and « B4 motifs , as suggested from the analysis of the human Ce promoter ( 29 ) , in which two closely positioned NF- « B binding sites with distinct NF- « B/Rel-binding properties possess different functions .
While a p50/Rel B-binding « B site was shown to be critical for basal transcriptional activity , the adjacent p50/ p65-binding B site was indispensable for the IL-4-dependent germline Ce gene expression .
We have not examined the binding of BSAP to the putative ECS-Iy3 BSAP consensus site , but disruption of this element did not reduce the CD40L-dependent inducibility .
This is in contrast with the essential role of BSAP in the response of the human Ce promoter to CD40 engagement ( 28 ) .
Several critical experimental parameters may account for this discrepancy , including the sequence of DNA fragment tested in reporter assays , the transfection protocol , and the B cell lines used for transfections .
Exposure of B cells to IL-4 activates the ECS promoter and induces germline I1y3-Cy3 transcription .
Targeted ECS-Iy3 deletional mutants and EMSAs revealed that the Cy3 IL-4 RE includes two critical elements , i.e. , the NF- « B/Rel-binding « B3 and « B4 sites and the downstream STAT-6-binding GAS site .
Since the disruption of either of these elements abolishes the IL-4 respon-siveness , functional cooperation between NF- « B/Re ! l and STAT-6 transcription factors seems to be critical for IL-4-dependent inducibility .
These findings extend previous reports showing that STAT-6 binding sites within the mouse Cy1 or the mouse and the human Ce promoters require the presence of contiguous NF- « B/ Rel or C/EBP binding sites to confer IL-4-dependent transcriptional activation ( 17 , 28 , 29 , 40 ) .
In contrast to the mouse Cy1 promoter , the IL-4-dependent inducibility of the human Cy3 promoter is not dependent on C/EBP , as mutation of the ISRE/kB5/ C/EBP composite element does not lead to the reduction of IL-4 inducibility , possibly reflecting the distinct organization of STAT-6 and C/EBP binding sites in the mouse Cyl and in the human Cy3 gene promoter .
We speculate that the functional cooperation between GAS , « B3 , and « B4 sites within the IL-4 RE of the Cy3 promoter underlies a physical interaction between NF- « B/Rel and IL-4-induced STAT-6 proteins .
Consistent with this hypothesis is the demonstration that NF- « B/Rel and STAT proteins interact with non-STAT transcription factors , including ba-sic-leucin zipper family members ( 41-44 ) , and the finding that the cytokine-dependent activation of E-selectin and IFN-B gene promoters may require the interaction between NF- « B and activating transcription factor-2 or STAT proteins , respectively ( 44 , 45 ) .
Although able to induce the Cy3 promoter in the absence of additional stimuli , IL-4 activates STAT-6 , but not NF- « B .
It is conceivable that , upon binding to the GAS element , IL-4-induced STAT-6 interacts with NF- « B proteins constitutively bound to the « B3 and « B4 sites ( see Fig .
7A ) .
Several mechanisms can account for the €CD40- and IL-4R-de-pendent transcriptional synergism .
First , the overlapping organization of the CD40 and IL-4 REs within the Cy3 promoter may provide the structural basis for the transcriptional cooperation between CD40- and IL-4R-induced signals .
For instance , the synergistic activation of the Cy3 promoter might result from the physical and/or functional interaction between CD4OL-induced NF- « B/ 6107 '01 4epy uo 1san8 4q /310° jountwrut { 'mmmy ; / : dyy wor ; The Journal of Immunology Rel and IL-4-induced STAT-6 proteins .
Interestingly , B cell receptor ( BCR ) -induced NF- « B/Re !
activation does not synergize with IL-4R co-signaling ( our unpublished data ) , implying that the functionality of NF-/Rel complexes induced by CD40 and BCR are distinct .
It is also conceivable that other CD4O-specific , but not BCR-specific , transcription factors interacting with NF- « B/Rel complexes are involved in the synergistic response .
An alternative but not mutually exclusive hypothesis is that a DNA segment within the ECS-Iy3 region contains a CD4OL- or a CD4O0L and IL-4-dependent enhancer that would amplify the transcriptional synergism brought about by the functional interplay between the « B3 , « B4 , and GAS sites .
Accordingly , the deletion of the -449 to -352 ECS-Iy3 region results in about 50 % reduction of the CD40L- and IL-4-induced synergism .
In both CL-O1 and naive B cells , CD4O0L-induced NF-KB binding to the Cy3 CD40 RE is strongly enhanced by IL-4 .
This enhancement may rely on the ability of IL-4 to amplify the recruitment of TNFR-associated signal transducers , including TNFR-associated factor-2 ( TRAF-2 ) , a well-known NF-KB acti-vator , to the CD4O-signaling complex ( 46 , 47 ) .
Alternatively , IL-4 might increase the levels of active NF- « B/Re !
by enhancing the CD40-mediated degradation of IBB molecules .
Consistent with this hypothesis is the demonstration that IFN-y enhances the TNF- « -induced NF-KB activation by amplifying the TNF-o & -dependent degradation of IBB proteins ( 48 ) .
Whether the IL-4-mediated enhancement of NF- « B/Rel ! l binding to the Cy3 CD40 RE is due directly to enhanced NF- « B activation or augmented degradation of IkBB proteins is presently addressed in our laboratory using human CL-O01 cells .
In conclusion , our demonstration that CD4OL and IL-4 cooperatively induce the ECS and activate 1y3-Cy3 germline transcription provides a mechanistic explanation for the documented synergism between CD4O0L and IL-4-induced signals in effecting S- Sy3 DNA recombination and may constitute a paradigm for the structure-function analysis of other human Cy gene regulatory regions .
