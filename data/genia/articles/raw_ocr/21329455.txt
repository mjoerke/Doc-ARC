To investigate the role of costimulation of OX40 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection by its natural ligand , gp34 , the OX4O-transfected ACH-2 cell line , ACH-2/0X40 , chronically infected with HIV-1 , was cocultured with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) -fixed gp34-transfected mouse cell line , SV-T2/gp34 .
The results showed that HIV-1 production was strongly induced .
This was followed by apparent apoptosis , and both processes were specifically inhibited by the gp34-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody 5A8 .
Endogenous TNF alpha ( TNF- « ) and TNF-fB production were not involved in the enhanced HIV-1 production .
Furthermore , enhanced HIV-1 transcription in gp34-stimulated ACH-2/0X40 cells was dependent on the B site of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat , and the OX40-gp34 interaction activated consisting of p50 and p65 subunits .
When primary activated CD4* T cells acutely infected with , , ( CXCR4-using T-cell-line-tropic ) were cocultured with PFA-fixed gp34* human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-bearing MT-2 cells or SV-T2/gp34 cells , HIV-1 production was also markedly enhanced .
The enhancement was again significantly inhibited by 5A8 .
The present study first shows that OX40-gp34 interaction stimulates HIV-1 expression and suggests that OX40 triggering by gp34 may play an important role in enhancing HIV-1 production in both acutely and latently infected CD4* T cells in vivo .
Interaction between molecules of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) superfamily , including TNFRI ( CD120a ) , TNFRII ( CD120b ) , Fas ( CD95 ) , CD40 , CD30 , CD27 , 4-1BB ( CD137 ) , and OX40 ( CD134 ) , and their ligand molecule superfamily has been shown to costimulate a variety of cellular responses , such as cell growth , differentiation , and programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) ( 13 ) .
Human OX40 was identified as a cell surface type I transmembrane glycoprotein antigen of 50 kDa , whose expression is limited to activated T cells ( 20 ) .
Its natural ligand , gp34/human OX40 ligand ( OX40L ) , belongs to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) superfamily , including TNF , FasL , CD4O0L , CD30L , CD27L , and 4-1BBL .
Gp34 was originally identified as a type II transmembrane glycoprotein of 34 kDa expressed on human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) -infected T-cell lines and induced by the transactivator p40 '' * of HTLV-1 ( 26 , 40 ) .
Subsequently , it was shown that gp34 was the ligand for human OX40 ( 3 , 11 ) .
The expression of gp34 is limited to activated normal B cells and activated Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cells ( 11 , 28 ) , vascular endothelial cells ( VEC ) ( 16 ) , and a subset of blood-derived un-stimulated or CD4O0-stimulated dendritic cells ( DC ) ( 30 ) .
The OX40-gp34 interaction has been shown to induce bidirectional signals and thus is implicated in various immunolog- * Corresponding author .

( i ) For example , gp34 on DC and gp34 transfectants provided a costimulatory signal to OX40* helper T cells , resulting in increased proliferation , cytokine production , and preferential differentiation of naive CD4 * T cells to type 2 helper phenotype .
Simultaneously , ligation of gp34 on human DC by OX4O0 enhanced their maturation and production of cytokines ( 3 , 11 , 30 , 31 ) : ( ii ) gp34 expressed on activated B cells can receive a signal from OX40 on helper T cells , which resulted in B-cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion ( 28 ) ; and ( iii ) the OX40/gp34 system directly mediated the adhesion of OX40* T cells to gp34 '' * human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) ( 16 ) , and c-jun m-RNA was induced in * HUVEC ( 22 ) .
Several lines of evidence showed that some members of the TNF/TNFR superfamily play important roles in enhancing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection : ( i ) TNF alpha ( TNF-a ) enhances HIV-1 replication by directly increasing its transcription level through induction of NF-kB in T-cell lines ( 8 , 32 ) ; ( ii ) CD30 triggering stimulated HIV-1 expression through an NF- « B-dependent pathway in the chronically HIV-1-infected T-cell line ACH-2 ( 4 ) , and CD4 * T cells from HIV-1-positive individuals also demonstrated enhanced HIV-1 production by CD30 stimulation in the presence of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) ( 21 ) ; ( iii ) cross-linking of 4-1BB with agonistic MAb significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication in CD4* T cells from HIV-1* individuals in the presence of anti-CD3 MAb ( 46 ) ; and ( iv ) CD40 stimulation in the presence of interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) and IL-2 upregulated HIV replication in B cells ( 12 ) .
Recent studies have shown that activation of Vor .
75 , 2001 TNFR superfamily proteins , including TNFRI , TNFRII , CD30 , 4-1BB , CD40 , and OX40 , recruited several members of signal transducers called TNFR-associated factors ( TRAFs ) , and some members of the TRAF family are responsible for the activation of NF-kB ( 1 , 17 , 19 ) .
In the present study , we explored the effect of OX40 costimulation by gp34 .
We show here that stimulation of acutely and chronically HIV-l-infected T cells through OX40 by gp34 `` HTLV-1 * T cells or gp34-transfected cells , respectively , significantly enhances HIV-1 expression in vitro .
Our findings suggest that OX40-gp34 interaction in vivo in HIV-1-infected patients may be involved in the enhancement of productive infection of HIV-1 .

RESULTS Triggering of OX40 by gp34 stimulates HIV-1 production from chronically infected T cells .
To investigate the potential role of interaction between gp34 and OX40 in HIV replication , we used chronically HIV-1-infected T-cell lines , ACH-2 .
The expression of OX40 and gp34 in this cell line was examined by FACS analysis .
The ACH-2 cells did not express gp34 and OX40 on their surfaces ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , we established stable human OX4O0-expressing ACH-2 , ACH-2/ OX40 cells , and ACH-2/mock cells by electroporation of the pCAGIPuro/OX40 vector and the pCAGIPuro vector alone without an insert as a control , respectively .
As a stimulator , we also established gp34-transfected mouse cell line SV-T2 , SV-T2/gp34 cells and empty vector-transfected SV-T2 , SV-T2/ Vor .

Enhanced expression of HIV-1 by OX40 stimulation from HIV-1 chronically infected ACH-2/0X40 cells .
( A ) Five groups of ACH-2/0X40 cells ( cell groups 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 10 ) , four groups ACH-2/mock cells ( cell groups 2 , 7 , 8 , and 10 ) , and the parental ACH-2 cell line were stimulated by PFA-fixed SV-T2/gp34 cells or PFA-fixed SV-T2/mock cells at a cell ratio of 2:1 with TNF- « ( 2 ng/m ! )
or TNF-B ( 10 ng/ml ) .
After 3 days , HIV-1 production was determined quantitatively by p24 assay using the culture supernatants .
( B ) PFA-fixed SV-T2/gp34 cells and PFA-fixed SV-T2/mock cells were preincubated with or without anti-gp34 neutralizing MAb ( 5A8 ) or control MAb ( Cont . )

As shown in Fig .
1A , all the ACH-2/0X40 cells ( cell groups 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 10 ) tested were apparently enhanced for HIV-1 expression through signaling from PFA-fixed SV-T2/gp34 cells .
In the control coculture with OX40~ ACH-2/ mock cells ( cell groups 2 , 7 , 8 , and 10 ) or ACH-2 cell lines , the production of HIV-1 remained at the basal level .
Importantly , enhanced expression of HIV-1 from ACH-2/0X40 # 10 cells by PFA-fixed SV-T2/gp34 cells was dose dependently inhibited by the anti-gp34 MAb 5A8 ( Fig .
1B ) .
The kinetic studies showed that HIV-1 expression by interaction of gp34 and OX40 could be detected as early as 18 h after cocultivation and that HIV-1 p24 increased over time ( Fig .
1C ) .
Similar results were also obtained in another cells , ACH-2/0X40 # 4 ( data not shown ) .
These results clearly showed that triggering of OX4O0 by its ligand , gp34/OX4A0L , stimulates HIV-1 production from T cells persistently infected with HIV-1 .
Triggering of OX40 by gp34 induces apoptosis in chronically infected T cells .
Since the gp34/OX40 system has been implicated in the modulation of proliferation in different cellular systems , we investigated whether HIV-1 induction by 67532 TAKAHASHI ET AL .

The results are a mean number of absorbance values obtained in triplicate .

coculture was associated with an effect on the proliferation of T lymphocytes .
Interestingly , when cells of the ACH-2/ OX40 # 10 cells were induced for HIV-1 production by gp34 , they apparently underwent cell growth retardation ( Fig .

The cell viability was only about 40 % 2 days after coculture and , after that , surviving cells recovered and increased gradually in numbers .
This pattern of cell growth and morphology was similar to the effect of TNF-a .
TNF- « treatment of ACH-2/0X40 cells resulted in much stronger cell killing .
On the other hand , TNF-B induced a little cell death in each cell .
Furthermore , we demonstrated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel of the DNA ( Fig .

Autocrine secretion of TNF- « and TNF-B does not account for enhanced HIV-1 expression in ACH-2/0X40 cells stimulated with gp34 .
ACH-2/0X40 # 10 cells were cocultured with PFA-fixed SV-T2/ gp34 cells or PFA-fixed SV-T2/mock cells at a cell ratio of 2:1 or were cultured in the presence of TNF- « ( 2 ng/ml ) or TNF- ( 10 ng/m ! )

) , anti-human TNF- neutralizing MAb ( 5 g/ml ) , or control MAb ( 50 pg/ml ! )
for 1 h at 37°C .
Culture supernatants were harvested after 3 days , and then the HIV-1 p24 level was measured .
The results are the means of values obtained in triplicate .
Representative results are shown from three independent experiments .

2D ) that this cell death was due to apoptosis .
Very similar results were obtained in another ACH-2/0X40 # 4 cells ( data not shown ) .
In ACH-2/mock # 7 cells and the parental ACH-2 cell line , apoptosis was induced by TNF-a but was not induced by gp34 ( data not shown ) .
HIV expression by triggered OX40 is not mediated by endogenous TNF secretion .
It is possible that autocrine secretion of TNF was responsible for HIV-1 expression caused by OX40-stimulation .
Figure 3 shows that blocking Abs directed against TNF-a and TNF- abrogated HIV production from ACH-2/ OX40 # 10 cells induced by the respective cytokines , but these two Abs had no effect on the HIV-1 expression enhanced by PFA-fixed SV-T2/gp34 cells , indicating that interaction of gp34 and OX40 on ACH-2/0X40 cells leads to enhanced virus production independent of endogenous secretion of TNF- « or TNF-B .
Indeed , the level of TNF- « and TNF-B in the supernatants from ACH-2/0X40 # 10 cells cocultivated with PFA-fixed SV-T2/gp34 cells was < 10 pg/ml ( data not shown ) .
Similar results were also obtained in another cells , ACH-2/ OX40 # 4 ( data not shown ) .
B sites in the LTR are required for HIV transcription induced by interaction of gp34 and OX40 .
Because it has been described that NF- « B activation is necessary for the induction of HIV-1 transcription by TNF- « in ACH-2 cells , we investigated whether the same was true for HIV-1 expression by OXA40-stimulation .
ACH-2/0X40 # 4 cells were transiently transfected either with an HIV LTR construct linked to the reporter gene luciferase ( pLTR-luc ) or with its respective plasmid in which the xB sites were deleted ( pLTR-lucANF-B ) .

Transcriptional activity of HIV LTR induced by OX40 stimulation .
ACH-2/0X40 # 4 cells were cotransfected by the DEAE-dextran transfection procedure with the constructs of wild-type pLTR-lue ( WT-luc ) or « B-deleted type pLTR-lucANF-kB ( AkB-lue ) ( 101g/ 5 x 10° cells ) , and pRL-TK ( 1 pg/5 X 10° cells ) .
The transfectants were cultured for 40 h at 37°C .
Luciferase activities were determined 8 h after stimulation by PFA-fixed SV-T2/gp34 cells or PFA-fixed SV-T2/mock cells at a cell ratio of 2:1 , by TNF-a ( 2 ng/ml ) , or with medium alone .
Transcriptional activity of HIV LTR was expressed as normalized luciferase activity .
The results are the means of values obtained in triplicate .
Three independent experiments showed similar results .
+ TNF-a cells resulted in the induction of luciferase activity when the cells were transfected with the pLTR-Luc wild-type construct ( ca .
fourfold higher than baseline ; Fig .
4 ) but not with the deleted kB construct .
Similar results were also obtained in another cells , ACH-2/0X40 # 10 ( approximately twofold higher than baseline ; data not shown ) .
In the ACH-2/mock # 7 cells and ACH-2 cell line , HIV-1 LTR transactivations were induced by TNF- « , but they remained at the basal level with gp34 ( data not shown ) .
These data clearly indicate that trans-activation of the HIV-1 LTR by OX40 cross-linking requires the presence of NF-kB sequences in the LTR .
Interaction of gp34 and OX40 leads to the activation of NF-KB in ACH-2/0X40 cells .
To determine whether OX40 stimulation by gp34 induces NF- « B binding activity in ACH-2/0X40 cells , we performed EMSA .
ACH-2/0X40 # 10 cells were cultured with or without PFA-fixed SV-T2/gp34 cells , PFA-fixed SV-T2/mock cells , or TNF- « , and then the cells were harvested after 3 h ( in the case of cocultivation with SV-T2/gp34 cells or SV-T2/mock cells ) or 1 h ( for TNF- « or medium alone ) ; nuclear extracts were then prepared .
The bands , indicated by an arrow in Fig .
5 , of gp34-stimulated ACH-2/0X40 cells were NF-kB specific since they are apparently abrogated with a 50-fold excess of cold NF- « B oligonucleotide but not with a mutated NF- « B oligonucleotide ( Fig .
5A , lanes 8 to 10 ) .
Since the NF- « B family is comprised of several molecules that can dimerize and thus result in the formation of different complexes , we further investigated which molecules were involved in the NF- « B specific bands of gp34-stimulated ACH-2/0X40 cells .
For this purpose , supershift assays were performed with the nuclear extracts of gp34 67534 TAKAHASHI ET AL .

OX40 triggering by gp34 expressed on HTLV-1* T cells enhances HIV-1 production from HIV-l-infected primary CD4* T cells .
Finally , primary CD4 * T cells acutely infected with wild-type or NF- « B mutant HIV-1yn ; , , were cocultured with PFA-fixed gp34* MT -2 cells or SV-T2/gp34 cells .
On days 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 after cocultivation , p24 levels in the culture supernatants were monitored .
Cocultivation with PFA-fixed MT-2 cells resulted in the enhancement of wild-type HIV-1 production from CD4* T cells on days 5 , 6 , and 7 .
Dramatic augmentation of HIV-1 production by gp34 was seen in CD4 * T cells infected with T-cell-line-tropic HIV-1 .
The enhanced HIV-1 production was inhibited by more than 50 % by pre-treatment of PFA-fixed MT -2 cells with anti-gp34 neutralizing MAb ( 5A8 ) ( Fig .
6A , left panel ) .
Similar results were also obtained in another stimulation system with PFA-fixed SV-T2/ gp34 cells ( Fig .
6A , right panel ) .
These results showed that stimulation of OX40* primary T cells acutely infected with HIV-1 with gp34 enhanced HIV-1 production .
Interestingly , NF- « xB mutant HIV-1 production was also enhanced by cocultivation with PFA-fixed MT-2 cells or SV-T2/gp34 cells on days 5 , 6 , and 7 , although stimulation was less efficient .
The enhanced HIV-1 production was significantly inhibited by 5A¥8 ( Fig .
6B ) .
These results showed that sites other than those for NF- « B binding were also involved in primary CD4* T cells .
DISCUSSION AIDS is a clinically multifaceted disease , and primary infection with HIV is usually followed by a variably prolonged period of clinical latency .
Multiple factors are involved in the complex interplay between HIV and host anti-HIV immune responses .
It is thus important to understand the underlying mechanisms of activation of the large pool of latently infected cells and the progressive destruction of lymphoid tissues .
It has been reported that HIV-1 expression is augmented through signaling from some members of the TNF/TNFR superfamily , including TNF/TNFR ( 8 , 23 , 24 ) , CD30L/CD30 ( 4 , 21 ) , and 4-1BBL/4-1BB ( 46 ) , and some of the cytokine-recep-tor systems such as IL-1/IL-IR ( 33 ) and IL-6/IL-6R ( 35 ) .
In the present study , we showed that stimulation of OX40 with gp34 in HIV-l-infected primary T cells and a chronically infected ACH-2/0X40 cells leads to enhanced HIV-1 expression , as measured by the production of HIV-1 in the culture supernatants .
Furthermore , we have examined the molecular mechanisms by which gp34-OX40 interaction activated HIV-1 expression in ACH-2/0X40 cells and have shown that the xB sites present in the HIV-1 LTR are required for HIV-1 transcription in this system .
The lack of activity obtained using HIV-1 LTR-luc plasmids lacking the NF- « B sites strongly suggests that OX40 stimulation by gp34 proceeds primarily through « B-binding sites .
In addition , we have observed that two NF-kB components , p50 and p65 subunits , are induced to bind to the xB sites upon OX40 stimulation of ACH-2/0X40 cells in EMSAs and supershift assays .
All of these data support the notion that NF-kB activation is responsible for enhanced HIV-1 replication in HIV-1-infected cells by OX40 and gp34 interaction in ACH-2/0X40 cells .
Enhancement of virus production by gp34-OX40 interaction was also reproduced in primary CD4* T cells acutely infected with HIV-1 .
Thus , it is strongly suggested that a similar event may occur in Vor .

Enhanced HIV-1 expression in primary CD4 * T cells by coculture with gp34-expressing cells .
Anti-CD3 MAb-stimulated primary CD4 * T cells cultured for 8 days in the presence of rhIL-2 and rhIL-4 were infected with wild-type ( WT ) ( A ) or NF- « xB mutant ( AkB ) ( B ) HIV-ly ; 4 ; at an MOI of 0.002 .
They were cultured either alone or with a half number of PFA-fixed gp34* MT -2 cells , SV-T2/gp34 cells , or SV-T2/mock cells pretreated with or without MAb ( 10 ug of anti-gp34 neutralizing MAb [ 5A8 ] per ml or a subtype-matched control MAb [ Cont . ] ) .
After HIV-1 infection , culture supernatants were harvested to measure the HIV-1 p24 level .
The results are the means + standard error of the mean for values obtained in triplicate .
Representative results are shown from three independent experiments .
vivo .
However , it is important to note that in this experimental system , not only wild-type but also NF- « B mutant HIV-ly ; 4 ; were enhanced to produce virus upon stimulation with OX40 , although the mutant virus was less efficiently enhanced .
Thus , it is clear that sites other than those for NF-kB binding were also involved in primary CD4* T cells .
It is interesting to address further whether this difference is due to either the difference between acute and chronic infection or the difference between primary T cells and cell line cells .
It was of note that apparent apoptosis was observed in ACH-2/0X40 cells when they were stimulated by gp34 .
This result is quite different from the case of CD30L-stimulated CD30* ACH-2 cells , in which no cell death but rather a slight stimulation of cell proliferation was observed ( 4 ) .
Therefore , the effect of OX40 signaling on cells is similar to that of TNF- « .
Thus , it is of particular importance to investigate a potential role of the OX40/gp34 system in vivo , not only from the aspect of enhancement of HIV-1 but also in light of the killing of 6756 TAKAHASHI ET AL .
HIV-1-infected cells as observed in the TNF/TNFR model ( 24 ) .
On the other hand , in the stimulation system of ACH-2/ OX40 cells by gp34 or TNF- « , since FasL-neutralizing MAb could not inhibit apoptosis these apoptosis may be independent of the FasL/Fas system ( data not shown ) .
It has been shown that extensive HIV-1 replication occurs in secondary lymphoid organs , where CD4 * T-helper cells meet antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) ( 9 , 14 ) and are activated to express OX40 ( 31 ) .
DC are the most potent APC in vivo .
Generally , it is considered that immature DC in peripheral tissues capture antigens efficiently and have the unique capacity to subsequently migrate to the T-cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs ( 2 ) .
The fact that gp34 is predominantly expressed on APC , such as DC and B cells , suggests the importance of OX40-gp34 in HIV-1 productive infection .
Furthermore , gp34 on DC was shown to induce differentiation of naive CD4* T cells to IL-4-secreting type 2 helper phenotype ( 31 ) , in which virulent T- cell-line-tropic HIV-1 can proliferate preferentially ( 43 ) .
This may facilitate the production of Abs specific to HIV-1 antigens from B cells by means of IL-4 secreted from type 2 helper T cells .
In addition , since gp34 has been shown on the cell surface of VEC ( 16 ) , interaction of blood OX40* T cells infected with HIV-1 may be activated by gp34* VEC , which may enhance HIV-1 production in inflammatory sites .
The OX40-gp34 interaction has been shown to induce bidirectional signals .
For example , gp34 stimulation by OX40 transduced a signal in DC , which resulted in enhanced TNF-a and IL-18 production ( 30 ) .
Since these cytokines are potent stimulators of HIV-1 production from infected T cells , HIV-1 infected OX40* T cells contacting gp34 '' DC may receive signals not only from OX40 stimulation but also from these cytokines .
Furthermore , it would be interesting to examine whether the activation of DC with OX40 may enhance the expression of DC-SIGN , which is responsible for capturing HIV-1 , in the periphery and facilitating its transport to secondary lymphoid organs rich in T cells and thus enhance infection in trans of these target cells ( 9 ) .
Besides DC , B cells , and HUVEC ( 16 , 28 , 30 ) , it has been demonstrated that HTLV-infected cells express gp34 ( 40 ) .
Therefore , it is of interest to study whether such gp34~* HTLV * T cells enhance HIV-1 production in patients harboring both HTLV and HIV-1 .
Recent in vitro studies showed that ( i ) noninfectious HTLV-1 virions induced the production of large quantities of HIV-1 from T cells by mitogenic stimulation ( 47 ) ; ( ii ) primary CD4 * T cells treated with soluble Tax protein and cell-free supernatants from HTLV-l-infected MT-2 cell cultures , containing B-chemokines of RANTES ( regulated upon activation , normal T-cell expressed and se-creted ) , macrophage inflammatory protein 1 « ( MIP-1 « ) , and MIP-18 became highly susceptible to T-cell-line-tropic HIV-1 ( 29 ) ; and ( iii ) coinfection of monocyte-derived macrophages with T-cell-line-tropic HIV-1 and HTLV-1 significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication ( 39 ) .
Since Tax induces both OX40 and gp34 ( 15 , 26 , 34 ) , OX40-gp34 interaction induced by Tax may enhance HIV-l-production .
Furthermore , since MT-2 culture supernatants contain soluble gp34 ( Y. Tanaka et al. , unpublished data ) , it will be worthwhile to test whether an anti-gp34 MAb , 58 , can inhibit such enhancement .
We showed that OX40-gp34 interaction plays an important J. Virou .
role in enhancing HIV-1 replication in vitro .
Since in HIV-1-infected patients CD4 * T cells are activated to express OX40 in addition to CD4O0L and Fas ( 37 ) , it is speculated that these OX40* CD4* T cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid organs , where cell-to-cell contact can easily occur , can be co-stimulated by gp34 in vivo .
This potential mechanism of induction of HIV-1 expression from both acutely and latently infected CD4 * T cells by direct cellular interaction may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease .
Therefore , intervention of interactions between OX40 and gp34 will be considered as a potentially new therapeutic strategy for inhibiting enhanced HIV-1 replication in vivo .
