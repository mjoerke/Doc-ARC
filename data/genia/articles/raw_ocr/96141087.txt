The Promoter and 5 ' Flanking Sequences Controlling Human B29 Gene Expression By Alexis A. Thompson , William J .
Wood Jr , Michael J. Gilly , Michael A. Damore , Sidne A. Omori , and Randolph Wail The product of the B-cell-specific 829 gene ( B29 , ig $ B , CD79b ) is essential for Ig-mediated B-cell activation via the B-cell antigen receptor complex ( BCR ) on human and murine B lymphocytes .
To better understand the regulation of this pivotal gene , we have analyzed the human genomic DNA sequence upstream of the 829 ATG start codon for transcriptional control activity .
The human B29 gene lacks either a TATA or a CAAT box and transcription is initiated at multiple sites .
The minimal promoter of the human B29 gene is contained within a 193-bp region 5 ' of these multiple start sites .
This minimal promoter exhibits B-cell-specific activity and contains SP1 , ETS , OCT , and IKAROS/LYF-1 transcription factor motifs .
All these motifs are strikingly conserved in sequence and placement relative to the previously charac- HE STRUCTURE AND function of Igs in normal and neoplastic B-cell development has been studied exten-sively , but the nature of the B-cell antigen receptor complex has been only recently elucidated . ''
All Ig isotypes on the surface of murine and human B lymphocytes are associated with heterodimeric complexes of two transmembrane pro-teins , designated mb-1 ( Iga , CD792 ) and B29 ( Ig B , CD79b ) , which are encoded by the mb-/ and B29 genes , respec-tively . ''
Membrane-bound Igs and mb-1-B29 heterodimers comprise the B-cell antigen receptor complex ( BCR ) .
The mb-1 and B29 proteins are critical for the intracellular as-sembly , translocation , and cell surface display of the BCR complex on B lymphocytes . ''
Antigen binding to Ig in the BCR signals B-cell activation through the mb-1-B29 complexes in a manner analogous to that of the T-cell receptor and associated CD3 subunits . ''
The cytoplasmic tails of B29 and mb-1 contain highly conserved amino acid elements present in other signal transducing proteins in membrane receptor complexes ( eg , CD3 & , 7 , y , 6 chains , CD22 , and Fc , receptor # and y chains ) . ''

Additional upstream gene segments dramatically affected B29 minimal promoter activity .
A newly identified motif called the B29 conserved sequence ( BCS ) , found upstream of both human and murine B29 pro-moters , appears to stimulate B29 transcription through a novel mechanism .
A single BCS had little effect either on the minimal B29 promoter or on a heterologous promoter .
instead , the BCS stimulated transcription by counteracting 5 ' negative regulatory DNA sequences that block the activity of the B29 minimal promoter in its absence .
These findings indicate that B29 gene expression is controlled by the complex interplay of positive and negative regulatory elements .

HUMAN 829 PROMOTER AND 5 ' FLANKING SEQUENCES B29 promoter .
We find that the activity of the B29 minimal promoter is controlled by upstream negative and positive regulatory sequences .
We have identified a new transcription control motif in this upstream region called the B29 conserved sequence ( BCS ) that is highly conserved in human and murine B29 genes .
The BCS apparently functions as a positive transcription control element by counteracting the inhibitory activity of nearby DNA sequences on the minimal B29 promoter .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Genomic clone isolation .
_ A 6-kb EcoRI human genomic DNA fragment hybridizing with B29 5° cDNA restriction fragments and synthetic oligonucleotides was cloned in both orientations . ''
This plasmid ( pBS27-I ) was further digested with Kpn I creating a 2.7-kb EcoRl-Kpn I subclone ( pBS27-IB/Kpn I ) containing the region upstream of the B29 coding region .
Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy method of Sanger using Sequenase ( US Biochemical , Cleveland , OH ) .
The nucleotide sequence has been submitted to GenBank ( accession no .
U22954 ) .
Cell lines and culture conditions .
- The human cell lines used in these studies ( 729 B-lymphoblastoid , Namalwa B-cell , 697 pre-B-cell , H929 and RPMI8226 myeloma cells , Jurkat T-cell leukemia , HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells , and HeLa cells ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mmol/L gluta-mine.and 10 % fetal calf serum ( Hyclone , Logan , UT ) .
Nalm-6 , a human pre-B leukemia , was grown in RPMI 1640 and 10 % defined-iron supplemented newborn calf serum ( Hyclone ) .
All cells were grown at 37°C and 5 % CO ; and were maintained at a maximum cell density of 2 x 10¢/mL .
RNAse protection assays .
- A 700-bp Apa I fragment of pBS27-1B/Kpn I containing the first exon of the B29 gene was subcloned into the pGEMSZf ( - ) vector ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and used as the template for in vitro transcription .
Using 1 ug of Age I-linearized plasmid , a `` P-CTP ( 650 Ci/mmol ; ICN , Costa Mesa , CA ) , and SP6 RNA polymerase ( 20 U ; Promega ) , a 450-bp RNA probe with high specific activity was synthesized .
After DNAse treatment to remove the template , the probe was purified over a G-50 Sephadex spin column and 8 x 10° cpm of the probe was ethanol precipitated with 20 ug of RNA and then hybridized at 48°C overnight .
Unannealed probe was digested with a 1:100 dilution of RNAse A/TI ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) , and the protected fragments were separated on a 6 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel .
Gels were fixed and dried before autoradiography .
Reporter gene assays .
- Transient gene expression was performed by electroporation using vectors containing the bacterial gene , chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) , as the reporter gene .
An 800-bp Pst I fragment from pBS27-IB/Kpn I encompassing the B29 transcription start site cluster was subcloned into the polylinker of the promoterless pCAT Basic vector ( Promega ) in the 5 ' to 3 ' orientation .
The same fragment was cloned in reverse orientation into a pCAT Basic vector that has been modified to incorporate the multiple cloning site of pGEMSZf ( - } vector ( Promega ) .
A series of 5 '' deletion mutants of both clones were prepared by exonuclease III/ mung bean nuclease treatment ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) .
Sequencing was performed to delineate the 5 ' ends .
A double-stranded synthetic oligomer , 5° CCAAGAGGCTCT-GCTCTGGGCCCCTCCAGA 3 ' , corresponding to the BCS at -507 to -477 was inserted by blunt ligation in both orientations into the BamHI site downstream of the CAT gene in selected deletion constructs .
This same oligomer was also cloned into a HindIII site in the J21 vector that contains the minimal c-fos promoter 5 ' to the CAT gene . ''
A 133-bp genomic fragment that 667 included the BCS was isolated from the end of a reverse deletion mutant and also subcloned into J21 .
Plasmids were transiently transfected into cell lines in culture by electroporation ( BRL , Bethesda , MD ) .
Samples of approximately 1 x 10 '' cells suspended in RPMI 1640 and 20 % fetal calf serum were incubated on ice for 10 minutes , with 25 ug of test plasmid then electroporated at 1,180 uF and 625 V/cm .
After being kept on ice for an additional 10 minutes , the samples were transferred to 10 mL of warm media and placed in a 37°C incubator .
After 2 days , cells were harvested in 200 mmol/L K ; PO , , pH 7.8 , 2 mmol/L dithiothrei-tol , 30 mmol/L MgSQO , , and 10 mmol/L ATP .
Cell extracts were analyzed for CAT reporter gene activity by acetylation of `` C-labeled chloramphenicol and thin-layer chromatography separation .
All studies were normalized with 5 ug of cotransfected pRSV-luciferase plasmid to correct for differences in transfection efficiency .
Measurements of luciferase enzyme activity from 30 pL of each cell extract in the presence of 100 gL of 1 mmol/L luciferin were performed on an automated injection luminometer .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
Crude nuclear extracts from the 697 , 729 , 8226 , Jurkat , and HL-60 cell lines were prepared using the method previously described by Dignam et al , '' with some modifications .
Tris-HCl ( pH 8 ) was used in place of HEPES in the extraction buffers and dialysate , and the optimized concentration of salt in the final extraction buffer was 0.4 mol/L KCI .
Binding reactions were performed with 10 ug of extract , 2 ug poly ( dI-dC ) ( Phar-macia , Piscataway , NJ ) , and 10,000 cpm of gel purified yP '' end-labeled oligonucleotide or DNA fragment .
Competition experiments were performed with 50- , 125- , and 500-fold excess of unlabeled probe .
A double-stranded unrelated oligonucleotide with the following sequence was used as the nonspecific competitor : 5'TGCGAT-TTGCATATTA3 ' .
Reaction products were analyzed on 5 % nonde-naturing polyacrylamide gels ( acrylamide : bisacrylamide 80:1 ) in 0.5 % TBE buffer .
RESULTS 5 ' Sequence and transcription initiation sites in the human B29 gene .
A 2.7-kb human genomic DNA fragment containing the first exon of the B29 gene was cloned using probes from the 5 ' end of the human £29 cDNA sequence . ''
The DNA sequence extending 1.3 kb upstream from the human B29 translation initiation codon is shown in Fig 1 .
The nucleotide sequence coding for the human B29 leader sequence is 76 % identical to murine B29 leader sequence and exon 1 ends at the same 5 '' splice junction as the murine B29 gene . ''
As is the case for the murine B29 gene , the human B29 5 sequence does not contain any sequence resembling a TATA or a CAAT box for several hundred nucleotides upstream of the coding sequence of exon 1 .
The B29 gene , like many genes lacking a TATA box , has multiple transcription start sites .
RNAse protection assays were performed on RNA samples from human cell lines to identify the termini of B29 gene transcripts .
The synthetic RNA probe used in these assays spanned exon 1 and extended 325 nucleotides 5 of the ATG translation start codon .
The results of these assays using RNA samples from B-lineage cell lines and a T-cell line are shown in Fig 2 .
Five protected RNA probe fragments were seen with RNA from two B-cell lines ( Ramos and Namalwa , lanes 1 and 2 , respectively ) , a pre-B-cell line ( Nalm 6 , lane 3 ) , and a myeloma cell line ( H929 , lane 4 ) .
The absence of any protected fragments with RNA from the T-cell line ( Jurkat , lane 5 ) is consistent with the B-cell From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 10 , 2019 .

'* '' '' * 5 ' Sequences controlling human B29 gene transcription .
DNA fragments produced by successive 5 ' deletions of the sequenced upstream region of the human B29 gene were inserted into the promoterless pCATBasic reporter vector and analyzed in transient transfection assays to identify regions with transcriptional activity .

The -796-bp B29 5 ' DNA fragment produced a 17-fold induction in CAT activity in the human B-cell line , 729 .
Similar results were obtained when this plasmid was transfected into another human B-cell line , Namalwa ; into the human pre-B-cell lines , Nalm-6 and 697 ; and into the murine B-cell line , M12 ( results not shown ) .
This pCAT/-796 construct exhibited B-cell-specific activity as it failed to stimulate CAT activity in either HeLa cells or in Jurkat T cells ( Table 1 ) .
Further 5 ' deletions , producing DNA fragments ending at -643 , -532 , and -464 bp , successively decreased transcriptional activity .
The CAT activity obtained with the -464 deletion fragment was reduced 90 % from the activity of the -796 fragment ( ie , -464 exhibited only 2-fold stimulation over the background expression with the promoterless pCATBasic vector ; Fig 3 ) .
Transcription-stimulating activity then increased with further 5 ' deletion to -304 and reached a maximum with DNA fragment -193 ( Fig 3 ) .
The stimulatory activity of the -193 construct ( ie , 16-fold ) is equivalent to that of the -796 construct .

These changes in transcriptional activity were reproducibly seen in four independent transfections with the set of 5° DNA deletion constructs of the -796 B29 DNA fragment .
The 193-bp human B29 promoter strongly stimulated transcription in all B-lineage cell lines , but exhibited little activity over background in either Jurkat T cells or HeLa cells ( Table 1 ) .
Like the murine # 29 minimal promoter , the human B29 minimal promoter is B-cell-specific .
This minimal promoter segment contains the same array of transcription factor motifs previously shown to regulate the activity and B-cell specificity of the murine 829 minimal promoter . ''
The ATTTGCAT sequence exactly corresponds to the canonical octamer motif ( OCT ) . ''
Two ETS motifs immediately downstream of the OCT motif are putative binding sites for the B-cell and macrophage transcription factor , PU.1 , as well as for other members of the ETS oncogene family . '' ''
A motif for IKAROS/LYF-1 family members is located upstream of the OCT motif .
`` * '' '' All these motifs are required for the activity of the murine B29 minimal promoter . ''
The sequence in the human B29 minimal promoter containing these transcription factor motifs is 91 % identical to the comparable sequence in the murine B29 minimal promoter ( see Fig 6 ) .
Activity of the BCS .
_ We next analyzed the active regions upstream of the human B29 minimal promoter for other highly conserved sequences .
One 29 nucleotide stretch was noted with 83 % sequence identity to a sequence upstream of the murine B29 gene .

Deletion of the upstream DNA fragment containing the homologous sequence in the murine B29 gene also caused a significant decrease in transcriptional activity '' '' ( unpublished results ) .
To determine whether the BCS had inherent transcriptional activity , a double-stranded synthetic 29-bp oligomer of the BCS was inserted in both orientations upstream of the the c-fos promoter in the J21-CAT reporter gene vector .
This basal promoter is 56-bp long , with a TATA box . '' ''
Either orientation of the BCS produced less than a twofold increase in c-fos promoter CAT activity in transiently transfected 729 human B cells ( results not shown ) .
This indicates that the BCS only minimally affects the efficiency of transcription from a heterologous basal promoter .

Transcriptional analysis of the B29 conserved sequence ( BCS ) .
Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the BCS was ligated into selected CAT constructs and transiently transfected into 729 B cells , and the effect on CAT activity of each construct relative to the vector alone was measured .
Results represent the mean CAT induction and standard deviation of three experi-ments .
Reinsertion of the BCS sequences into the -464 construct from which it had been deleted resulted in CAT activity comparable to the -532 construct that contains the sequences .
The effect of the BCS on increasing CAT activation by the minimum promoter ( -193 ) is less dramatic .
-193 promoter ( -193/BCS ) had little effect on minimal promoter activity ( -193 ; Fig 4 ) .
However , the addition of a single copy of the BCS oligomer to the -464 deletion construct increased transcriptional activity fivefold , resulting in an transcriptional activity comparable to that seen with the -532 B29 gene fragment containing the BCS ( Fig 4 ) .
Again , the BCS was equally active in either orientation .
This result strongly suggests that the BCS is the principal active element in the human B29 gene sequences from -532 to -464 .
These results also suggest that the BCS acts on negative regulatory sequences in the -464 B29 gene construct rather than directly on the 193-bp minimal B29 promoter .
BCS factor binding studies .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) were used to detect complexes of nuclear factors bound to the BCS .
In these studies , a double-stranded synthetic 29-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to the BCS sequence was incubated with nuclear extracts from human 729 B cells , 697 pre-B cells , 8226 plasmacytoma , Jurkat T cells , and HL-60 myeloid cells .
The interaction of the end-labeled BCS oligonucleotide probe with nuclear proteins from 729 cells resulted in retarded mobility of a doublet protein-DNA complex ( Fig 5 ) .
The specificity of this interaction was established by the addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled double-stranded BCS oligonucleotide that resulted in the incremental loss of the retarded band .
THOMPSON ET AL An excess of an unrelated oligonucleotide competitor of similar size had no effect on BCS binding .
Studies performed on 697 pre-B cells and H929 plasma cells gave results similar to those with 729 nuclear extracts ( data not shown ) .
Nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells and 8226 myeloma cells ( which contain no detectable B29 mRNA ) yielded only nonspecific binding .
No binding was detected in studies using nuclear extracts from HL-60 cells .
Additional assays performed with a radiolabeled 130-bp genomic DNA fragment that contained the BCS also showed specific binding and competition of a multibanded complex , suggesting that sequences adjacent to the BCS motif may contribute to nuclear factor binding or stability .
These EMSA results , combined with the reporter gene expression assays , strongly suggest that the BCS is an important regulatory element for B29 gene expression .

These are separated by an intervening segment with a different length and lower sequence conservation in relation to the murine minimal promoter .
The most highly conserved region in the human promoter ( ie , -23 to -34 ) is 91 % identical to the murine B29 promoter sequence ( ie , -48 to -158 ) that contains all the transcription control motifs determined to control the activity of this promoter ( Fig 6 ) .
The ATTTGCAT at -74 exactly matches the murine £29 octamer motif ( OCT ) and the canonical OCT motifs in Ig heavy and light chain gene promoters and the Ig heavy chain intron enhancer . ''
Mutation of this motif in the murine promoter completely abolished transcriptional activity . '' ''
The two ETS boxes ( CAG-GAA and GAGGAA ) immediately downstream of the OCT are putative binding sites for the macrophage and B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 as well as other members of the ets oncogene family . '' ''
A single consensus motif for SP1 ( GGCGGG ) is located at position -42 .
The CCTCCC-CCA sequence at - 118 closely corresponds to the consensus motif for IKAROS/LYF-1 family members that are known to control lymphocyte gene expression .
`` * '' '' '' '' Mutations in the SP1 , ETS , and IKAROS/LYF-1 motifs all reduced the transcriptional activity of the murine B29 minimal promoter . ''
The region immediately downstream of the IKAROS/LYF-1 motif ( ie , -126 to -138 ) also contributed to the activity of the murine B29 minimal promoter in B cells . ''
The in vitro footprint with purified LYF-1 extended CCAAA -- -CCTCc -- -L » Lp -- -- -- -- -- -- TTGGGCTCﬁAGACAGAGCAGTGACCALQ +1 through this region and this sequence is well conserved in the human B29 promoter sequence .
The region ( ie , -22 to + 27 ) containing the mapped human B29 transcription start sites exhibits approximately 60 % identity ( incorporating numerous gaps ) to the corresponding murine B29 promoter sequence ( ie , nucleotides -8 to -47 ; Fig 6 ) .
The human B29 minimal promoter lacks a TATA box and transcription is initiated at 5 sites located 44 to 53 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon .
The multiple transcription initiation sites in the murine B29 promoter are more broadly distributed and lie 12 to 33 bp upstream of the ATG codon .
Neither the location nor spacing of transcription start sites is conserved in human and murine B29 sequences .
The murine sites only partially overlap those in the human B29 gene .
Multiple transcription initiation sites have now been described in a number of other TATA-less lymphocyte-specific genes , including mb-7 , '' '' the surrogate light chains A5 '' and Vpre-B . ''
CD7 , * '' CD11a , * CD18 , '' CD19 , * and CD22 . ''
However , it is not known how transcription initiations are determined in these genes .
TATA-less , GC-rich promoters in constitutively expressed housekeeping genes exhibit multiple transcription starts 40 to 80 bp downstream of multiple SP1 motifs . ''
Interestingly , the multiple start sites in both the human and murine B29 promoters are located 40 to 80 bp downstream of lone SP1 motifs .
The second region of high sequence conservation in the human B29 minimal promoter ( ie , +28 to +53 ) is 88 % identical to the homologous murine sequence ( ie , to +19 ; Fig 6 ) .
This region comprises 26 bp of 5'-untranslated ( 5'-UT ) region directly preceding the ATG codon .
It is notable that the sequence conservation in this region is greater than that of the leader coding sequence .
The function of this highly conserved 5 '' -UT sequence is not known .
The Kozak box directly preceding the ATG codon is the only known functional element in this sequence .

672 rine B29 sequence contains the major transcription initiation site ( +1 ) and a minor start site ( +8 ) .
However , the locations of transcription initiation sites in human and murine B29 genes do not exhibit any discernable spatial relationship to this highly conserved sequence .
The region upstream of the B29 minimal promoter apparently contains multiple elements that stimulate and inhibit B29 gene transcription .
The quite substantial loss in transcription activity ( ie , 15-fold ) seen with 5 deletions from -796 to -464 suggests that this region contains multiple elements that exert positive influences on the 829 minimal promoter .
In contrast , the -464 fragment appears to contain sequences that exert a powerful dominant negative effect on the activity of the downstream B29 minimal promoter .
The activity of construct -464 was 15-fold lower than that of the 829 minimal promoter in B-lineage cells .
Negative regulatory elements may extend into the DNA fragment ending at -304 , which showed less activity than the 829 minimal promoter .
Collectively , these functional expression studies indicate that the region upstream of the human £29 minimal promoter contains a complex array of both positive and negative transcription control elements .
Studies are in progress to identify the functional elements in this region and to determine if they collectively function as enhancers or silencers controlling B29 gene specificity and expression .
One positive 5 ' regulatory element , initially identified by its high sequence conservation in both human and murine B29 5 regions , is the BCS .
The BCS is located in an upstream region which stimulates B29 transcription .
Deletion of the 5 ' segment containing the BCS ( ie , -532 to -464 ) produced a fivefold decrease in transcriptional activity .
The sequence of the BCS does not resemble any known transcription factor motif , suggesting that this may represent a novel regulatory element .
Studies on the effects of an isolated BCS on either homologous or heterologous promoters and on the -464 B29 gene segment confirm this suggestion .
A single 29-bp BCS element had only minimal effects ( < 2-fold ) on the 193-bp B29 minimal promoter or a 56-bp c-fos promoter .
In contrast , insertion of a single BCS upstream of the -464 construct increased transcriptional activity to the level seen with the -532 construct containing the BCS .
These results suggest that the BCS stimulates transcription by counteracting nearby negative regulatory elements rather than by acting directly on the B29 promoter .
A similar mode of regulation has been reported in the x intron enhancer in which the inhibitory activity of a 27-bp negative segment ( « NE ) was prevented by an adjacent 30-bp positive segment ( « BS ) . ''
Interestingly , dimerized x BS segments had no effect on the transcriptional activity of the c-fos promoter . ''
Like the BCS , the « BS apparently lacks significant transcriptional activity outside of its context in the x intron enhancer .
The stimulatory activity of the BCS may be mediated by specific nuclear proteins .
Specific nuclear protein complexes were readily detected in EMSA using a 29-bp oligomer BCS .
Specific competition with the BCS oligomer establishes that this sequence is bound by proteins in the complexes .
It is possible that additional sequences in the 130-bp DNA fragment may be required for the formation or stabilization of the BCS-binding protein complexes .
The BCS-binding activ- THOMPSON ET AL ity was tissue-specific and was detectable at all stages of B-cell development .
Interestingly , the BCS complex was not seen in the RPMI 8226 myeloma cell line that does not express B29 mRNA .
This report continues our exploration of the human B29 gene and increases our understanding of its regulation .
This gene plays a critical role in the cell surface display of membrane Ig and in signal transduction and B-cell activation through the B-cell antigen receptor complex .
Resolution of the molecular features regulating B29 gene expression should provide insights into potential mechanisms for disease states resulting from abnormal antigen receptor complex expression or function .
