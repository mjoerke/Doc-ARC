Binding of PHJVD ; , was saturable , with approximately 2000-3000 sites/cell , and half-maximal binding occurring at 0.21-0.33 nm .
Treatment of RW Leu-4 cells with VD ; induced 24 R-hydroxylase activity , a marker of vitamin D ; responsiveness in many tissues .
Exposure of RW Leu-4 cells to VD ; also inhibited proliferation and DNA synthesis with a 50 % effective dose of 3.5-10 nm within 72 h ; in addition , protein and RNA synthesis were inhibited by VD ; treatment .
Exposure of RWLeu-4 cells to 5 nv VD ; for 72 h caused 50 % of the cells to differentiate into macrophage/monocyte type cells as judged by nitroblue tetrazolium staining and adherence to plastic .
Progressive expression of cell surface maturation-specific antigens of the monocyte/macrophage lineage was induced by treatment of RW Leu-4 cells with VD ; for 24 to 72 h at doses that inhibited cellular proliferation .
c-myc RNA , which is constitutively expressed in RWLeu-4 cells , increased after 0.5 h of treatment with 50 nv VD ; and then rapidly decreased to barely detectable levels after 4 h of treatment .
Finally , the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity associated with the p210 '' ** '' oncogene product was decreased approximately 50 % by VD ; treatment .
Because of the presence of a functional receptor-effector system for VD ; and multiple biological responses to the hormone , these cells provide a unique model system with which to probe the specific effects of VD ; on cell growth and differentiation in chronic myelogenous leukemia .
INTRODUCTION VD ; is a sterol hormone with well known actions in calcium and phosphate homeostasis .
Most , if not all , of its actions are mediated in a fashion prototypic of steroid hormones via the binding and activation of high affinity nuclear receptors .
The activated receptors then modulate gene expression by binding to regulatory regions of one or more genes ( 1 ) .
In classical target tissues , VD ; enhances the expression of calcium-binding protein , alkaline phosphatase , and the 24-hydroxylase ( 1-3 ) .
Extremely sensitive radioligand receptor binding assays have now shown that VD ; receptors are present not only in the classical target tissues such as bone , intestinal mucosa , and Received 9/13/88 ; revised 1/31/90 .

The presence of high affinity VD ; receptors in so many cell types suggests that the biological functions of this hormone may go well beyond calcium and phosphate homeo-stasis ; indeed , it has been proposed that VD ; may be involved in the regulation of gene expression , cell growth , proliferation , and differentiation in many diverse systems ( 1 , 5-12 ) .
Because VD ; is known to affect the differentiation of certain leukemia cell lines ( 4-12 ) we were interested in the effects of VD ; on cells derived from patients with CML .
In approximately 90 % of CML cases , the leukemic cells bear a cytogenetic abnormality known as the Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ' ) , a shortened chromosome 22 resulting from a reciprocal translocation of the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 [ t ( 9 ; 22 ) q34 ; q1 1 ] ( 13 ) .
This translocation results in the fusion of the ber and abl protooncogenes and the expression of a 210kDa BCR-ABL fusion protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity which has been implicated in the etiology of CML ( 14 ) .
It is of note that agents which induce in vitro differentiation of CML cells [ e.g. , 1-8-p-arabinofuranosylcytosine ( 15 ) ; a « -inter-feron ( 16 ) ] can lead to remissions in this disease when administered therapeutically .
As part of our investigations of CML , Wiemann et al .
( 17 ) have established the permanent cell line , RWLeu-4 , from a patient in the blast phase of CML .
These cells are Ph ' positive and express an aberrant p210 '' * '' fusion protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity ( 18 ) ( see Table 1 for the characteristics of RWLeu-4 ) .
We report here that RWLeu-4 cells possess high affinity receptors for VD ; and that treatment of RW cells with this natural seco-sterol hormone causes them to cease prolifer-ating , inhibits macromolecular synthesis , and induces them to differentiate into cells with the characteristics of mature mono-cytes or macrophages .
We also show that the level of c-myc mRNA within these cells is rapidly altered by VD , treatment and that the level of p210 '' '' ~**-associated tyrosine kinase activity is decreased after exposure to VD ; .

Briefly , log phase RWLeu-4 cells were washed once in cold PBS and resuspended at 3 to 6 million cells/ml in ice cold TEDK ; » , .
All subsequent operations were carried out at 4°C .
The cells were disrupted by sonication using ten 5-s pulses of a Branson microprobe set at level 6 .
The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 h in a 50Ti rotor .
Supernatant ( 0.2 ml ) was added to 2-fold serial dilutions of [ PH ] -VD : in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes yielding final concentrations of 2-0.015 nm and incubated overnight at 4°C .
Then 0.4 ml of a 50 % slurry of hydroxyapatite in TEDK : » ( TEDK » .
without protease inhibitors ) was added and the incubation was continued for 2 h. The hydroxyapatite was washed three times with TEDK ; , , containing 0.5 % Triton X-100 and resuspended in 1 ml of absolute ethanol .
The amount of radioactive material remaining in the final clarified ethanol supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting .
Total counts were determined by suspending an aliquot of each dilution of [ PHJVD ; in 1 ml of ethanol and counting .
Nonspecific binding was determined by isotope dilution with 1 um unlabeled VD ; before the addition of cell extract , and nonspecific counts in the final ethanol wash were subtracted to give specific VD ; binding .
25-Hydroxyvitamin D , 24R-Hydroxylase Assay .
The induction of 24 R-hydroxylase activity was measured as described by Gamblin et al .

Briefly , exponentially growing cells were harvested and resuspended at a density of 10 % /ml in serum-free media .
24R-Hydroxylase was induced by treatment of the cells with 50 nm VD ; for 16 to 24 h after which the cells were harvested , excess VD ; , was washed out , and 100 pmol [ 26,27°H ] 25-D ; were added .
The cells were then incubated for 30 min at 37°C , internal standards were added , and the cells were extracted with chloroform/methanol .
The organic phase of the cell extract was dried under a stream of nitrogen and dissolved in hexane/ isopropyl alcohol ( 92:8 ) and the metabolites of vitamin D ; , were separated by high performance liquid chromatography over a silica column with a mobile phase containing 8 % isopropyl alcohol in hexane .
Labeled metabolites were identified by coelution with internal standards and the fractions containing labeled metabolites were quantitated by liquid scintillation counting .
Effects of VD ; on Cell Proliferation .
Triplicate cultures of 1 x 10° cells/ml were treated in 24-well culture plates with 10-fold serial dilutions of VD ; from 107 '' to 10~ ' m , or equivalent concentrations of diluent alone in a final volume of 1 ml of RPMI 1640 plus 10 % fetal calf serum for 24 , 48 , 72 , and 96 h. At the end of treatment , the cells were chilled and scraped , and viable cells were counted in a hemocytometer .
At least 200 cells were counted from each culture well .
Viability was greater than 95 % in all cultures throughout this time period .
Effects of VD ; on Cellular DNA , RNA , and Protein Synthesis .
One x 10° cells/ml were treated in triplicate with 2-fold serial dilutions of VD , from 5 x 107 '' to 1 x 10~ ' m in a final volume of 200 Ll of RPMI 1640 plus 10 % FCS .
Control wells received diluent alone .

After a 4-h pulse , the cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters using an automatic cell harvester ( Whitaker/Biosystems ) .
In experiments to measure the rate of DNA or RNA synthesis , filters were dried and the total label incorporated into macromolecular fractions was determined by liquid scintillation counting .
In experiments to measure the rate of protein synthesis , after the cells were harvested onto filter paper disks , the filters were immersed in cold 10 % TCA for 5 min followed by immersion in hot ( 90°C ) 5 % TCA for 15 min .
The filters were then washed twice in cold 5 % TCA and once in ethanol before drying and counting ( 24 ) .

The cell lysate was layered over a 12.5-ml pad of 5.7 m CsCl-0.1 m EDTA and centrifuged for 16 to 24 h at 24,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 28 rotor .
The supernatant was then removed by aspiration , the tubes were drained by inversion , the pellet was washed first with 70 % ethanol , then washed with absolute ethanol , and dried in a vacuum .
The dried RNA pellet was then resuspended in water and extracted once with an equal volume of phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 10:10:0.2 ) and ethanol precipitated overnight at -20°C .
The final RNA peliet was resuspended in water and the concentration of RNA determined by absorbance at 260 nm .
RNA Blot Analysis .
Total RNA ( 20 amg ) was glyoxylated , separated on a 1 % agarose gel , and transferred to Nytran membranes essentially as described by Maniatis et al .
( 26 ) .
Membranes were baked for 1.5 h at 80°C in a vacuum oven , prehybridized with 5 x SSPE ( 1 x SSPE is 8.5 mm sodium phosphate-149 mm NaCl-1 mm EDTA ) , 10 % Denhardt 's solution ( 1 x Denhardt 's solution is 0.2 g/liter of bovine serum albumin , polyvinyl pyrrolidone , and Ficoll ) , 0.1 % SDS , 50 % formamide , and 100 ug/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA for 90 min at 42°C , and then hybridized in the same buffer containing 2 x 10° cpm/ml of [ « -*P ] dCMP-labeled complementary DNA probes for > 16 h.

[ a-P ] dCTP-labeled DNA with specific activities of approximately 10° dpm/ug were synthesized using the random priming technique of Feinberg and Vogelstein ( 29 ) .
In Vitro p210 '' ** '' Tyrosine Kinase Activity .
In vitro tyrosine kinase activity was measured as described by Huhn et al .
( 18 ) .
Briefly , exponentially growing RWLeu-4 cells were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 with 10 % FCS in the presence or absence of 50 nm VD ; .
Aliquots of 10° cells were lysed with 10 mm Tris-HCl ( pH 7.6 ) -50 mm NaCl-30 mM sodium pyrophosphate-50 mm NaF-5 mm EDTA-100 mm sodium o-vanadate ; 0.1 % bovine serum albumin-0.1 % Triton X-100 buffer and the lysates were precleared of nonspecific proteins by reaction with nonimmune rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose beads .
The precleared lysates were reacted with rabbit anti-abl peptide 4 antiserum or nonimmune rabbit serum as a control .
The immune complexes were adsorbed onto 25 ul protein A-Sepharose and washed twice with the previous buffer and twice with KB , 50 mm 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1-piper-azineethanesulfonic acid , pH 7.5-0.1 mm EDTA-0.015 % Brij-35 .
Twenty « l KB , 5 Ll 50 mm MgCl ; , and 5 l ( 40 mg/ml ) angiotensin II were added as substrate to the washed immune complexes ; phosphorylation reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 Ll of 1 mm [ « - '' '' P ] -ATP in KB ( specific activity , 2 mCi/ml ) .
Reactions were conducted for 10 min at 30°C with intermittent mixing and quenched by the addition of 120 ul of 10 % phosphoric acid .
Eighty ul of the supernatants were spotted onto 2-cm > pieces of Whatman p81 anion exchange paper , and washed three times with 6 % acetic acid , washed once with acetone , and allowed to air dry .
Adsorbed radioactivity was measured by Cerenkov counting .
RESULTS Characteristics of the RWLeu-4 Cell Line .
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the RW Leu-4 cell line as determined by Wiemann et a/ .
( 17 ) .
These cells have a doubling time of approximately 25-26 h and a saturation density of 1.4 x 10° cells/ml , they are colony-stimulating factor 1 independent , and they do not secrete colony-stimulating factor 1 .
Karyotype analysis indicates that they are Ph ' positive and analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that they express the p210° '' * '' tyrosine kinase ( 18 ) .
Expression of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigens is undetectable in these cells RWLeu-4 will form tumors in athymic mice using the fibrin clot technique developed by Lozzio et al .
( 30 , 31 ) .
The cells are NBT negative but express myeloperoxidase , naphthol AS-D chloroacetate ( spe-cific ) esterase , and a-naphthol acetate ( non-specific ) esterase activities constitutively , indicating that they are of the myeloid lineage .
Binding of VD , High Affinity Receptors .
Since nearly all of the activities thus far attributed to VD ; require the interaction between the hormone and its receptor , we examined RWLeu-4 cells for the presence of a high affinity nuclear VD ; receptor .

Because nuclear uptake studies reflect the measurement of several complex binding parameters ( binding to the hormone , binding to DNA , and retention in the nucleus ) , we determined the characteristics of the VD ; receptors isolated by extraction of RW Leu-4 cells with buffers containing 300 mm KCl .
These techniques allow the receptor to be released from the nucleus into the cytosolic fraction and may be a more accurate and direct measure of VD ; -receptor interactions .
Fig .
1 illustrates the saturation ( Fig .
14 ) and Scatchard analysis ( Fig .
18 ) of the binding data and indicates that RW Leu-4 cells contain approximately 2300 receptors/cell with a K , of 0.21 nm .
Induction of the Marker Enzyme 25-D ; -24R-Hydroxylase .
Treatment of normal target tissues with VD ; has been shown to induce the synthesis of the enzyme 24-hydroxylase which converts 25-D ; and VD ; into 24 R,25-D ; and 14,24 R,25-D ; .
In order to determine if RW Leu-4 cells responded to this hormone in a similar fashion we measured the induction of this enzyme .
Table 2 demonstrates that treatment of RW Leu-4 cells with 50 nM VD ; for 16 to 24 h induces the expression of this enzyme activity by 5- to 6-fold over that found in uninduced cells or in the no cell control .
Inhibition of Proliferation of RWLeu-4 Cells by VD ; .
It has been reported that VD ; can inhibit the proliferation of other leukemia cell lines such as HL-60 and U937 ( 4 , 12 ) .
Therefore , we determined the response of RWLeu-4 cell proliferation to VD ; treatment .
RW cells were treated with increasing concentrations of VD ; for 1-4 days and the total viable cell number was determined as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
Fig .
24 shows that treatment of RW Leu-4 cells with VD ; for 3-4 days inhibited RW Leu-4 proliferation with an EDs , of 3.5-7 nm .
We also observed that low doses of VD ; reproducibly stimulated cell proliferation at 24 h by approximately 20 % above that of untreated control cells .
Effects of VD , on Differentiation of RWLeu-4 Cells into Mature Myeloid Cells .
During treatment of RW Leu-4 cells with VD , we noted that the morphology of the RW cells changed ; many cells became adherent , the nuclei became lobed rather than round , and the cytoplasmic membranes became ruffled , sending out pseudopod-like processes ( Fig .
3 ) .
In addition , those cells that remained in suspension formed large clumps of cells .
We therefore determined the correlation between these morphological changes and the induction of differentiated characteristics in these cells .
One of the markers of myelomonocytic differentiation is the ability of the cells to reduce tetrazolium dyes , forming black formazan granules in the cytoplasm .
Fig .
2B illustrates the results of an experiment in which we measured the ability of VD ; -treated RW Leu-4 cells to reduce NBT .
NBT reduction was not particularly evident by light microscopic examination after 1 or 2 days , but after 3 days of incubation with 5 nm VD ; , 50 % of the cells displayed this differentiated characteristic .
After 4 and 5 days of treatment with VD ; , > 90 % of the cells in the culture were NBT positive .
In order to further define the VD ; -induced maturation of RWLeu-4 cells , we analyzed hormone-treated cells for the expression of cell surface antigens that are characteristic of mature myelomonocytic cells ( Fig .
4 ) .
Murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with T8 ( CD8 ) and 8 ; -microglobulin served as negative and positive controls , respectively .
HLA-DR ( Ia ) antigens were not expressed on RWLeu-4 , nor was expression induced by VD ; .
In contrast , the myelomonocytic markers 3089 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

The cells were then harvested , excess inducer was washed out , and the cells were incubated with [ °H ] 25-D ; for 30 min at 37°C .
Internal standards ( 25-D ; and 24R,25-D ; ) were then added , and vitamin D ; metabolites were analyzed as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
No cell controls were identical reactions performed in the absence of cells .
Results are expressed mean + SE ( in parentheses ) where applicable .

Cells VD ; pmol/million cells No cell control - 1.78 ( NA ) + 1.78 ( NA ) RWLeu-4 - 1.65 ( 0.15 ) + 11.95 ( 1.05 ) MoS , Mol , and My7 ( CDw13 ) ( 32-34 ) are constitutively expressed at moderate levels .
Expression of Mol increased significantly ( P = 0.004 ) after treatment with VD ; , while MoS and My7 induction was variable and not significant ( P > 0.5 ) .
Mo3 , a monocyte-specific activation antigen , was marginally and variably expressed prior to and after differentiation ( P > 0.5 ) , while Mo2 , a monocyte/macrophage specific antigen not present on untreated RW Leu-4 cells , was markedly induced by VD , ( P = 0.004 ) .
Taken together , these data demonstrate that VD ; causes the RWLeu-4 cell line to mature from an undifferentiated myelomonocytic cell to a differentiated monocyte/ macrophage cell but may not result in activation of the cell line as judged by the low levels of expression of the Mo3 antigen .
This observation was corroborated by experiments measuring another indicator of monocyte/macrophage activation , the ability of RW Leu-4 cells to phagocytize antigen-coated RBC .
While RWLeu-4 cells exhibit a low level of phagocytosis of human RBC , treatment with 50 nm VD ; for 3 days did not increase this activity when measured by light microscopic examination of phagocytosis or by uptake of *'Cr-loaded RBC ( data not shown ) ( 35 ) .
Inhibition of Incorporation by VD ; .
Fig .
5 shows the dose response and kinetics of the inhibition of DNA synthesis by VD ; , in RW Leu-4 cells .
There was a reproducible increase in [ H ] thymidine incorporation at low doses or early time points , followed by a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis ( ED ; , =3-10 nm ) .
Concentrations of VD ; greater than 50 nm inhibited DNA synthesis by as much as 90 % .
TPA was a more potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis than VD ; ( EDs , between 0.2 and 0.4 nm ) , and displayed more rapid kinetics , showing strong inhibition within 24 h after the initiation of treatment ( data not shown ) .
RNA and protein synthesis were also inhibited by VD ; treatment of RW Leu-4 cells .
Protein synthesis was inhibited by as much as 60 % after 1 day of treatment and by greater than 80 % at longer times , with an ED ; , of 7 to 10 nm .
Total RNA synthesis was not as affected by VD ; treatment , showing an EDs , of greater than 20 nm and less than 80 % inhibition even after 4 days ( data not shown ) .
Effects of VD ; on c-myc mRNA .
Northern analysis of total RNA isolated from RW cells showed that high levels of c-myc RNA are constitutively expressed ( Fig .
6 , top , 0 hour time point ) .
Fig .
6 shows an autoradiographic analysis of the effects of VD ; treatment on c-myc expression in RWLeu-4 cells .
Within 0.5 h after treatment with VD ; , c-myc-specific RNA sharply increased in quantity then decreased to barely detectable levels within 4 h. The bottom of Fig .
6 is an autora-diogram of the same blot after reprobing with a S-actin probe and shows that approximately equal amounts of RNA were loaded onto the gel in all lanes .
Effects of VD ; on c-abl-associated Tyrosine Kinase Activity .
Since the presence of constitutive p210 '' *~* '' tyrosine kinase activity has been associated with the initial transformation of CML cells , we examined the effects of VD ; , treatment on tyrosine kinase activity in RW Leu-4 cells .
While no difference in the steady state level of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins could be detected after in vivo P labeling of VD ; treated or control cells ( data not shown ) , there were differences in the in vitro protein kinase activity associated with proteins partially purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-c-ab/ antibodies .
Fig .

As can be seen , treatment of RWLeu-4 cells with 50 nm VD ; for 16 to 18 h decreased the tyrosine kinase activity of proteins that cross-react with rabbit anti-abl antibodies by approximately 50 % .

PERCENT POSTIVE CELLS Moe _ MoS DISCUSSION The studies reported here demonstrate that the immature , Ph'-positive myelomonocytic leukemia cell line , RWLeu-4 , possesses a high affinity receptor for VD ; with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.21-0.33 nm present at approximately 2300-3300 copies/cell .
These findings are similar to those reported in other leukemic cell lines such as HL-60 ( 36 , 37 ) .

antigens .
Taken together these findings indicate that the RWLeu-4 cells possess a functional receptor-effector system for VD ; and that VD ; is capable of inducing profound changes in the activity , morphology , and differentiation of these leukemia cells .
CML is a disease in which a defect in maturation and terminal differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells leads to an accumulation of both mature and immature Ph'-positive leukemia cells .
It is characteristic of this disease , as opposed to the acute leukemias , that , over a prolonged period of time , progressively more immature forms predominate until a rapidly occurring and fatal `` blast crisis '' intervenes .
Of interest is the fact that agents such as a-interferon and 1-8-p-arabinofuranosylcytosine , which can cause in vitro maturation and differentiation of CML cells , have also been shown to induce remissions in patients during chronic phase .
In this regard , it is noteworthy that nude 8,000 |- | 6,000 CPM 2,000 | CONTROL VD3 Fig .

Effects of VD , treatment on p210 '' '' **-associated tyrosine kinase activity .
Exponentially growing RW Leu-4 cells were treated with 50 nm VD ; or diluent alone ( control ) for 16-18 h. The cells were then extracted and immuno-precipitated , and the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity was measured as described in `` Materials and Methods . ''
mice inoculated s.c. with RWLeu-4 cells form tumors which regress in vivo in response to certain differentiation agents ( 38 ) .
These findings suggest that the pharmacological induction of maturation or differentiation in chronic phase CML can reduce the proliferation and accumulation of the leukemic cells and may lead to prolonged remissions .
As we have shown for the RW Leu-4 cell line and as has been demonstrated previously with the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line and the U937 monoblastic celi line , VD ; is an effective inducer of monocyte differentiation .
VD ; induces en-zymatic and surface antigen changes characteristic of mono-cytes in all three cell types .
It induces both RW Leu-4 and HL-60 to develop increased NBT reduction and expression of monocytic surface antigens .
Interestingly , neither RWLeu-4 nor HL-60 cells express an increase in the monocyte surface antigen Mo3 , a marker of monocyte activation ( as opposed to differentiation ) after exposure to VD ; .
This is further substantiated by the fact that phagocytosis of antibody-coated RBC , another marker for the activation of monocytes , is not increased in RW Leu-4 cells by treatment with VD ; .
In contrast , both cell types differentiate in response to treatment with the phorbol ester , TPA , and this agent does induce the appearance of Mo3 .
While HL-60 and RW Leu-4 cells have similar phenotypes , they are derived from genetically distinct types of leukemia .
Thus , the RW Leu-4 cell line offers a unique opportunity for studying the effects of differentiation agents such as VD ; , TPA , retinoic acid , and dimethyl sulfoxide on CML .
Furthermore , based on the present results and additional data being obtained with the nude mouse model system , it is apparent that the molecular events leading to commitment of this cell line to a program of monocytic differentiation can be productively studied both in vitro and in vivo .
RWLeu-4 cells grow continuously in culture , but treatment with low doses of VD ; ( EDs , =3-30 nm ) inhibit their proliferation , DNA , RNA , and protein synthesis in a time- and dose-dependent fashion .
Similar effects are induced by TPA .
How-ever , TPA does not compete with VD ; for binding to its receptor ( data not shown ) ; therefore , TPA does not exert its effects through the VD ; receptor .
It is thought that the activity of phorbol esters is mediated through binding and activation of the phospholipid-dependent PK , ( 39 ) .
At present , there are conflicting reports on the effect of VD ; on this enzyme activity : 3092 Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 10 , 2019 .

1a,25-DIHYDROXYVITAMIN D , EFFECTS ON CML CELLS Kuroki et al .
( 40 ) have shown in vitro that VD ; does not affect the activity of partially purified rat brain PK. , while Ways et a/ .
( 41 ) have shown in vivo that VD ; treatment of U937 cells does modulate the activity of PK , .
We are in the process of examining the effects of VD ; on PK , activity in RW Leu-4 cells in order to determine whether TPA and VD ; act at the same or different sites to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation .
Preliminary observations with a variant of RWLeu-4 ( RD ; ) show that this cell line is still sensitive to the antiprolif-erative effects of TPA , strongly suggesting that the effects of these two agents in RW Leu-4 cells are different .
* We therefore believe that phorbol esters and VD ; act via independent pathways or at different sites in connected pathways , which lead to a common result of differentiation to monocytoid cells .
RWLeu-4 cells are Ph ' positive and express the aberrant 210kDa BCR-ABL oncogene protein ( p210°~** ) characteristic of CML cells ( 18 , 42-44 ) .
The constitutive protein-tyrosine kinase activity of p210°* '' is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of CML , although its exact role is not established .
Ph'-positive cell lines and peripheral blood and bone marrow leukocytes of CML patients possess a characteristic spectrum of phosphotyrosy !
proteins that are candidates for cellular substrates of the p210** '' kinase ( 18 ) .
Thus , the phosphorylation of one or more of these cellular proteins on tyrosine residues may be involved in mediating proliferation- or trans-formation-related signal transduction .
It might be anticipated , then , that differentiation of CML cells would be correlated with alterations in phosphorylation of one or more of the physiolog-ically relevant substrates of p210 '' ~* '' .
Indeed , changes in the phosphorylation of cellular phosphotyrosyl proteins have been observed in RW Leu-4 cells induced to differentiate with phorbol esters . ''
We show here that treatment of RW Leu-4 cells with VD ; decreases the activity of c-abl-related tyrosine kinase activity in the presence of o-vanadate , an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase activity .
¢-myc expression has been correlated with the ability of cells to proliferate ( 45-47 ) .
While transient in nature , the rapid , initial increase in myc RNA levels seen after treatment of RWLeu-4 cells for 0.5 h may correlate with the stimulation of DNA synthesis that is seen with low doses or short exposure to VD ; ( Fig .
5 ) .
The decrease in c-myc mRNA expression seen at later times may be related to the inhibition of DNA synthesis .
Treatment of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells with VD ; suppresses proliferation ( 4 , 36 ) and the transcription of the c-myc oncogene ( 45 , 48 ) as well as inducing differentiation into mature monocyte/macrophage like cells ( 4 , 10 ) .
Similar results have been reported in other more undifferentiated leukemia model systems ( 12 , 49 ) , but the mechanisms by which VD ; inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation are un-known .
We are in the process of determining whether the effects of VD ; on c-myc expression are at the level of RNA synthesis or stability as well as investigating the effects of VD ; on the expression of other oncogenes .
We believe that the application of molecular biological and recombinant DNA techniques to the investigation of the effects of VD ; on the Ph'-positive cell line , RW offers a unique opportunity to elucidate the molecular events involved in the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia .
While similar investigations are ongoing with other cell lines such as HL-60 and U937 , RW Leu-4 cells are derived from a genetically distinct and differentiation specific leukemia and thus offer a unique model for both in vitro and in vivo studies in the athymic mouse * Manuscript in preparation .

model system .
These studies should provide insights into the mechanism of action of VD ; and may lead to a greater understanding of the action of protooncogene function in differentiating systems .
Such understanding may prove useful in developing therapies for chronic and acute leukemias .
