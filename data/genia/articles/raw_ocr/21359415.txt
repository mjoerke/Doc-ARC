Identification of Phosphorylation Sites for Bruton 's Tyrosine Kinase within the Transcriptional Regulator BAP/TFII-I* Received for publication , April 25 , 2001 Published , JBC Papers in Press , May 28 , 2001 , DOI 10.1074/jbe.M103692200 Ann Marie Egloff and Stephen Desideriof From the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and Howard Hughes Medical Institute , The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore , Maryland 21205 Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) , a member of the Tec family of cytosolic kinases , is essential for B cell development and function .
BAP/TFII-I , a protein implicated in transcriptional regulation , is associated with Btk in B cells and is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine following B cell receptor engagement .
BAP/TFII-I is a substrate for Btk in vitro and is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine upon coexpression with Btk in mammalian cells .
In an effort to understand the physiologic consequences of BAP/TFII-I tyrosine phosphorylation following B cell receptor stimulation , site-directed mutagenesis and phosphopeptide mapping were used to locate the predominant sites of BAP/ TFII-I phosphorylation by Btk in vitro .
These residues , Tyr '' , Tyr® '' '' , and Tyr** '' , were also found to be the major sites for Btk-dependent phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I in vivo .
Residues Tyr®* '' and Tyr are contained within the loop regions of adjacent helix-loop-helix-like repeats within BAP/TFIl-L Mutation of either Tyr®* '' , Tyr® '' , or Tyr '' to phenylalanine reduced transcription from a c-fos promoter relative to wild-type BAP/TFII-I in transfected COS-7 cells , consistent with the interpretation that phosphorylation at these sites contributes to transcriptional activation .
Phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I by Btk may link engagement of receptors such as surface immunoglobulin to modulation of gene expression .
Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) , which is expressed in B cells and cells of the myeloid lineage , was initially identified as the target of mutations responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans ( 1 , 2 ) .
Patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia exhibit an intrinsic defect in B cell development ; peripheral B cells are rare and of an immature phenotype , but the number of pre-B cells in the bone marrow is not significantly reduced , consistent with impairment of the pre-B to B cell transition ( 3 ) .
A point mutation in the orthologous tyrosine kinase is responsible for an X-linked deficiency of B cell function ( X-linked immunodeficiency , or xid ) in the mouse ( 4 , 5 ) .
The mouse xid phenotype is distinct from X-linked agammaglobulinemia ( 6 ) .
Antibody responses to some T cell-independent antigens are ab-sent , but responses to most T cell-dependent antigens are intact .

27806 Peripheral B cells are slightly reduced and skewed toward an immature phenotype .
Survival of peripheral B cells is dimin-ished , and the peritoneal B-1 B cell population is absent .
Notably , xid mice do not exhibit the block in early B cell development observed in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia .
Btk null mice exhibit a phenotype resembling xid , suggesting that B cell development has a more stringent requirement for Btk in humans than in mice ( 7-10 ) .
Btk belongs to the Tec family of cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinases , which includes Btk , Itk , Tec , and Bmx .
This group of kinases is related to the Src family by the presence of SH3 , SH2 , and SHI ( catalytic ) domains .
It is distinguished from the Sre family by 1 ) the presence of pleckstrin homology and Tec homology domains , which serve as binding sites for phospho-lipids and SH3 domains , respectively ; 2 ) the absence of an N-terminal myristoylation site ; and 3 ) the lack of a regulatory tyrosine residue near the carboxyl terminus ( 11-14 ) .
An atypical member of the Tec family , Rlk/I'xk , lacks a pleckstrin homology domain but has 54-62 % amino acid identity to Btk in the remainder of its sequence ( 15 , 16 ) .
Btk has been implicated as important in signaling from the B cell receptor for antigen , the interleukin-5 and -6 receptors , and CD38 on B cells ( 17-19 ) ; the FeeRI receptor on mast cells ( 20 ) ; the FeyRI on macrophages ; and the thrombin receptor on platelets ( 21 ) .
Upon engagement of the B cell receptor , Btk is phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase Lyn at residue Tyr® '' ' .
This permits Btk to undergo autophosphorylation at residue Tyr® '' '' , after which kinase activity is increased ( 22 ) .
The activity of Btk can also be modulated by association with G , « proteins ( 23 ) , GBy proteins ( 24 ) , or phosphatidylinositol phosphates ( 25 ) .
A fraction of Btk coimmunoprecipitates with a protein of ~135 kDa termed BAP ( for Btk-associated Brotein ) ; based on this association , BAP was purified , and its cDNA was molecu-larly cloned ( 26 ) .
BAP is identical to the putative transcription factor TFII-I ( 27 ) , which was identified by its ability to stimulate transcription from initiator elements ( 27 ) and its synergy with Phox I and serum response factor in enhancing transcription from the c-fos promoter ( 28 ) .
A distinctive feature of BAP/TFII-I is the occurrence of six helix-loop-helix ( HLH ) -like repeats .
In contrast to typical HLH motifs , however , which contain loop regions of between 6 and 20 amino acids ( 29 ) , the HLH-like repeats of BAP/TFII-I contain extended loop regions of ~70 amino acids ( 27 ) .
Four isoforms of BAP/TFII-I , generated by alternative splicing of primary RNA transcripts , are differentially expressed in various tissues .
Amino acid sequence differences among these four isoforms are confined to the interval between the first and second HLH-like domains ( 80 ) .

This paper is available on line at http : //www.jbc.org 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; Btk Phosphorylation Sites in BAP/TFILI-I bling the Sre kinase autophosphorylation consensus sequence ( EDXDY ) are present within this interval and are preserved in all four BAP/TFII-I isoforms .
BAP/TFII-I is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine following B cell receptor engagement , with kinetics that closely follow tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk ( 26 ) .
Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I is also observed upon cotransfection with Btk into fibroblastoid cells .
This response is dependent upon Btk kinase activity , since cotransfection with the kinase-inactive mutant Btk ( K430E ) fails to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I ( 26 ) .
These observations and the physical association of Btk with BAP/TFII-I in B lymphoid cells ( 26 ) suggested that BAP/TFII-I is a physiologic substrate for phosphorylation by Btk following B cell receptor stimulation .
Several lines of evidence suggest that phosphorylation modulates the ability of BAP/TFII-I to stimulate transcription .
First , dephosphorylation impairs the ability of BAP/TFII-I to stimulate transcription from a VB promoter in vitro , while sparing its ability to bind the VB initiator element ( 81 ) .
Second , stimulation of VB transcription by BAP/TFII-I in transfected cells is enhanced by wild-type Btk but not by a kinase-inactive mutant ( 32 ) .
Third , the transcriptional activity of BAP/TFII-I in transfected cells is impaired by mutation of a site conforming to the Sre autophosphorylation consensus ( 31 ) .
Fourth , epidermal growth factor , which enhances c-fos promoter activity , induces tyrosine phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I ( 83 ) .
While these observations are consistent with the interpretation that Btk activates BAP/TFII-I by tyrosine phosphorylation , definitive evidence is lacking .
As an essential step in defining a regulatory relationship between Btk and BAP/TFII-I , we have mapped the major Btk phosphorylation sites in BAP/TFII-I .
Bacterially expressed , purified Btk phosphorylates BAP/TFII-I at three predominant sites : Tyr®** , Tyr® '' '' , and Tyr*© '' .
The first site lies in the inter-repeat region between the first and second HLH-like domains ; the two other sites are at analogous positions in putative loop regions of the second and third HLH-like domains .
When Btk is coexpressed with BAP/TFII-I in mammalian cells , BAP/TFII-I is specifically hyperphosphorylated at the same three sites .
Btk-specific hyperphosphorylation of a BAP/TFII-I fragment in vivo was eliminated by mutation of these sites to phenylalanine .
The ability of BAP/TFII-I to stimulate expression of a c-fos reporter , in COS-7 cells was impaired by mutation of Tyr '' , Tyr® '' '' , or Tyr*® to phenylalanine , consistent with the interpretation that phosphorylation of these sites plays a role in transcriptional activation .
Phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I by Btk , and perhaps other Tec-related kinases , may link engagement of receptors such as surface immunoglobulin to modulation of gene expression .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids and Cell Lines-Plasmid pBAPmyc , encoding the shortest isoform of BAP/TFII-I ( BAP/TFII-I A ) , fused at the carboxyl terminus to a Pro-Gily linker and the c-Myc epitope EQKLISEEDL , was constructed from a BAP cDNA clone ( 26 ) by polymerase chain reaction .
The plasmid pBAPmyc ( BN ) was generated from pBAPmyc by introduction of Sail , Xbal , and in-frame BamHI sites 5 ' of the BAP/TFII-I coding sequence .
The following BAP/TFII-I carboxy- and amino-truncations were constructed from pBAPmyc ( BN ) using polymerase chain reaction : pBAP-N-1R ( residues 1-189 ) , pBAP-N-NR2 ( residues 1-303 ) , pBAP-N-2R ( residues 1-898 ) , pBAP-N-8R ( residues 1-508 ) , pBAP-4R-CT ( residues 514-957 ) , and pBAP-5R-CT ( residues 675-957 ) .
All constructs share an identical initiation sequence ( 34 ) and a carboxyl-terminal c-Myc epitope .

RESULTS Expression and Purification of BAP/ TFII-I and BAP/ TFII-I Fragments-The overall strategy used in these phosphorylation site mapping studies was 1 ) to determine which portions of BAP/TFII-I are phosphorylated by Btk in vitro ; 2 ) to define the specific tyrosine residues phosphorylated by Btk in vitro by a combination of phosphopeptide mapping and site-directed mu-tagenesis ; and 3 ) to verify that the same tyrosine residues are hyperphosphorylated in vivo upon coexpression of BAP/TFII-I with active Btk .

MBP-Btk ( 10 ul , lanes 1-3 ) , MBP-Bke ( 10 ul , lanes 5-7 ) , or kinase dialysis buffer ( 10 ul , lane 4 ) was combined with 10 ul ( Zanes 1 , 4 , and 5 ) or 2 ul ( lanes 2 and 6 ) BAP/TFII-I N-2R .
BAP/TFII-I N-2R was omitted from reactions analyzed in lanes 3 and 7 .
Reaction conditions were identical to those in A .
Following fractionation by SDS-PAGE , protein was transferred to PVDF and treated with 1 N KOH for 2 h at 55 °C .
Radiolabeled protein was detected by PhosphorImager .
The positions of MBP-Btk and BAP/TFII-I N-2R are indicated by arrows .
A contaminating phosphoprotein is indicated by an asterisk .
C , metal dependence of MBP-Btk activity .
MBP-Btk ( 10 ul , lanes 1-5 and 17-15 ) or MBP-Bke ( 10 pl , lanes 6-10 and 16-19 ) was incubated with 4 ul of BAP N-2R in 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.2 ) , 1 mM Na , MoO , , 10 uCi of [ y-*°P ] JATP , and the indicated concentrations of 100:1 manganese/magnesium ( lanes 1-10 ) or manganese alone ( lanes 11-19 ) .
Protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to PVDF , and stained with Ponceau S. Radiolabeled protein was detected by PhosphorImager panel ) .
The amount of radiolabel incorporated into BAP/TFII-I N-2R , as quantitated by scintillation counting , is plotted as a function of [ Me** ] ( right panel ) .
N-3R ( residues 1-503 ) , BAP N-2R ( residues 1-398 ) , BAP N-NR2 ( residues 1-303 ) , BAP N-1R ( residues 1-189 ) , BAP 4R-CT ( residues 514-957 ) , and BAP 5R-CT ( residues 675-957 ) .
Wild-type BAP/TFII-I , tagged with polyhistidine and a c-Myc epitope , was expressed and purified in parallel .
Expression and Purification of Btk-To define the sites at which Btk phosphorylates BAP/TFII-I in vitro , it was essential to obtain active Btk in a form free of contaminating tyrosine kinases .
Btk immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells was unsatisfactory for this purpose , since pilot experiments with a kinase-inactive mutant Btk revealed the presence of additional tyrosine kinase activities in such preparations .
Recovery of catalytically active Btk , expressed in E. coli , has been demonstrated ( 23 ) .
We therefore employed recombinant Btk , obtained from bacterial cells , since prokaryotes are devoid of tyrosine kinases .
Btk , fused at the amino terminus to MBP , was expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified by amylose affinity chromatography .
Btk ( KA430E ) , a kinase-inactive mutant , was prepared in parallel for use as a control .
Btk activity was initially assessed by autophosphorylation and by phosphorylation of the BAP truncation substrate BAP N-2R .
Increasing amounts of the MBP-Btk and MBP-Btk ( K430E ) preparations were incubated with [ y-°°P ] ATP as described in Fig .
2 .
Following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , protein was detected by PhosphorImager ( Fig .
2A , left ) and by silver staining ( Fig .
2A , right ) .
A prominent phosphorylated species was observed at the position of MBP Btk in reactions containing wild-type protein ( Fig .
2A , lanes 1-3 and 7-9 ) ; in reactions containing similar amounts of the kinase-inactive mutant , the corresponding fusion protein was phosphorylated at levels at least 3.6-fold lower ( Fig .
24 , lanes 4-6 and 10-12 ) .
A prominent 75-kDa phosphorylated species was observed in all reactions .
This protein is of bacterial origin , since it is also present in Ni nitrilotriacetic acid affinity preparations of BAP/TFII-I fragments ( Fig .
2B , lane 4 ) .
Phosphorylation of this protein and the trace phosphorylation of MBP-Btk ( K430E ) are likely carried out by a contaminating , bacterial serine/threonine kinase .
To assess phosphorylation activity in frans , equivalent amounts of MBP-Btk and MBP-Btk ( K430E ) were incubated with decreasing amounts of the BAP N-2R fragment and [ y-°°P ] JATP .
BAP N-2R was phosphorylated in reactions containing MBP-Btk ( Fig .
2B , lanes 1 and 2 ) but not in reactions containing MBP-Btk ( KA430E ) ( Fig .
2B , lanes 5 and 6 ) or in a reaction from which enzyme was omitted ( Fig .
2B , lane 4 ) .
Consistent with autokinase activity , a phosphorylated species corresponding in size to the input MBP fusion protein was present in reactions containing wild-type MBP-Btk ( Fig .
2B , lanes 1-3 ) but not in reactions containing the kinase inactive mutant ( Fig .
2B , lanes 5-7 ) .
These results indicated that the MBP-Btk preparation obtained from bacterial cells possesses autokinase activity as well as activity toward a BAP/TFII-I fragment .
Before proceeding to phosphorylation site mapping studies , 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 27810 the divalent cation dependence of MBP-Btk in vitro was opti-mized .
Autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the BAP N-2R fragment were assessed at various concentrations of Mg** or Mn** , alone or in combination ( Fig .
2 , C ) .
Reaction products were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to PVDF membrane , and visualized by Phospho-rlmager ( Fig .
2C , leff panel ) .
As observed above , MBP-Btk exhibited autokinase activity as well as activity against BAP N-2R ( Fig .
2C , lanes 1-5 and 11-15 ) , while MBP-Btk ( KA430E ) exhibited neither activity ( Fig .
2C , lanes 6-10 and 15-19 ) .
Membrane slices containing BAP N-2R , visualized by staining with Ponceau S , were excised , and °°P was quantitated ( Fig .
2C , right panel ) .
MBP-Btk was most active in reactions containing 2 mx Mn** , and these conditions were used in all subsequent in vitro reactions .
Localization of Btk Phosphorylation Sites within BAP !
TFILI-I-Similar amounts of purified , epitope-tagged BAP/ TFII-I or BAP/TFII-I truncation mutants , as assessed by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody ( Fig .
3A ) , were incubated with MBP-Btk in the presence of [ 7-32P ] ATP .
Kinase reactions were performed in triplicate .
Full-length BAP/TFII-I was incubated with MBP-Btk ( KA30E ) as a control .
Products were fractionated by gel electrophoresis , transferred to PVDF , and visualized by phosphorimaging ; a representative experiment is shown ( Fig .
3B ) .
The amount of radioactivity in each BAP/TFIL-I fragment was assessed ( Fig .
3C ) .
These experiments localized the major sites of phosphorylation by Btk in vitro to the region of BAP/TFII-I extending from the amino terminus through the third HLH-like repeat , although phosphorylation to a lesser extent in other regions could not be excluded ( Fig .
3C ) .
We proceeded to map the major sites of phosphorylation by Btk in vitro .
One-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping by 40 % alkaline gel electrophoresis ( 40 ) confirmed that while Btk phosphorylation sites are distributed throughout BAP/TFII-I , the principal sites of phosphorylation in vitro are located within the interval extending from the amino terminus through the third HLH-like repeat ( Fig .
44 , compare lanes 1 , 2 , and 5 with lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Importantly , most phosphopeptides present in full-length BAP/TFII-I were also present in the BAP N-3R fragment ( Fig .
44 , compare lanes 2 and 5 ) .
Comparison of the phosphopeptide patterns obtained from BAP N-2R and BAP N-3R ( Fig .
44 , lanes 1 and 2 ) revealed the presence of at least one Btk phosphorylation site between amino acid residues 398 and 503 ( 3R ) of BAP/TFII-I ( Fig .
4A , filled arrows ) .
The weak phosphorylation of BAP 4R-CT and BAP 5R-CT ( Fig .
44 , lanes 3 and 4 ) and the presence of at least one phosphopeptide in full-length BAP/TFII-I that is not found in BAP N-3R ( Fig .
44 , open arrow ) indicate that one or more minor Btk phosphorylation sites probably exist within the C-terminal portion of BAP .
Further dissection of the amino portion of BAP ( Fig .
4B ) revealed that , in addition to the 398-503 region ( 3R ) , the intervals spanning residues 304-398 ( 2R ) and 189-303 ( NR2 ) of BAP/TFII-I each contain at least one Btk phosphorylation site ( Fig .
4B , compare lanes 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 7 ) ; peptides corresponding to these three intervals are indicated ( Fig .
4B , filled arrows ) .
While one phosphopeptide fragment was recovered from a reaction containing BAP N-1R , this may not represent a specific phosphorylation site , since a comigrating species was present in all samples .
Taken together , the data obtained from phosphopeptide mapping of truncation mutants indicated that the principal targets of phosphorylation by Btk lie in three discrete intervals of BAP/TFII-I , comprising the second nonrepeat region , the second HLH-like region , and the third HLH-like region ( Fig .
4C ) .

Btk preferentially phosphorylates sites within the ami-no-terminal 508 residues of BAP/TFII-I in vitro .
A , quantitation of full-length and truncated BAP/TFII-I proteins .
Full-length ( FL ; lane 1 ) and truncated ( N-2R , N-3R , 4R-CT , and 5R-CT ; lanes 2-5 ) BAP/TEFII-I proteins , fused to polyhistidine and a c-Myc epitope , were expressed in E. coli , purified by Ni°*-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography , fractionated by SDS-PAGE , and detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody .
B , phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I fragments by Btk in vitro .
Equimolar amounts of full-length ( Zanes 1 and 6 ) or truncated ( Zanes 2-5 ) BAP/TFII-I proteins , as assessed in A , were incubated with 5 ul of MBP-Btk ( Zanes 1-5 ) or MBP-Btk ( K430E ) ( Zane 6 ) and 10 uCi [ y-* '' PJATP in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.2 ) , 2 mM MnCl , , and 1 mM Na , Mo0 , .
After 30 min at 37°C , products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to PVDF , and detected by PhosphorImager .
The positions of full-length , N-2R , and N-3R BAP/TFII-I are indicated by the open , filled and shaded arrowheads , respectively .
A contaminating phosphoprotein is indicated by an asterisk .
C , radiolabeled substrates were excised from PVDF membranes , and radioactivity ( Cerenkov ) was quantitated .
The results of three independent experiments are plotted .
Bik , reactions performed with MBP-Btk ; Bke , reactions performed with MBP-Btk ( KA80E ) .
Full-length ( FL ) and truncated ( N-2R , N-3R , 4R-CT , and 5R-CT ) substrates are indicated .
sis was used to identify the specific tyrosine residues targeted for phosphorylation by Btk in each of the three intervals identified in the previous experiments .
There are four tyrosine residues , Tyr®* , Tyr®* , Tyr '' , and Tyr® '' '' , within the second nonrepeat region ( residues 190-303 ) of BAP/TFII-I .
Simultaneous mutation of these tyrosine residues to phenylalanine in BAP N-2R and BAP N-3R ( BAP N-2R ( 4F ) and BAP N-3R ( 4F ) ) specifically eliminated phosphopeptides previously mapped to the second nonrepeat region ( Fig .
4B , compare lanes 3 and 5 with lane 6 ) .
Thus , at least one of these four tyrosine residues is a target for phosphorylation by Btk in vitro .
Tryptic phosphopeptides derived from outside of the second nonrepeat region of BAP/TFII-I were unaffected by these point mutations .
Phosphorylation of other sites within BAP/TFII-I by Btk is therefore independent of phosphorylation in the 190-303 interval .

Phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I within the second and third HLH-like domains and the second nonrepeat region by Btk in vitro .

Lanes 1-4 , truncation mutants N-2R , N-3R , 4R-CT , and 5R-CT , respectively .
Lane 5 , full-length BAP/TFII-I .
Phosphopeptides derived from the third HLH-like repeat are indicated by closed arrows .
A minor phosphopeptide present in the full-length protein but not contained within the N-3R mutant is indicated by the open arrow .
B , one-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analysis of wild-type and mutant BAP/ TFII-I , phosphorylated by Btk in vitro .
Lane 1 , full-length , wild-type BAP/TFII-I ; lare 2 , BAP/TFII-I N-2R ; lane 3 , BAP/TFII-I N-2R ( 4F ) , which carries phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr '' , Tyr '' * '' , Tyr '' , and Tyr '' ; lane 4 , BAP/TFII-L N-8R ; lane 5 , BAP/TFII-L N-8R ( 4F ) , which carries phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr®* '' , Tyr '' , Tyr® '' '' , and Tyr '' '' '' ; lane 6 , BAP/TFIl-L N-NR2 ; lane 7 , BAP/TFII-I N-1R .
Phosphopeptides derived from the second HLH-like domain ( 28 ) , the third HLH-like domain ( 3R ) , and the second nonrepeat region ( NRZ ) are indicated by closed arrows .
wild-type BAP/TFII-I and BAP/TFII-I mutants were phosphorylated in vitro by MBP-Btk , and tryptic phosphopeptides were resolved by electrophoresis ( Fig .
5A ) .
In addition to a BAP/ TFII-I mutant carrying phenylalanine replacements at all four tyrosines in the second nonrepeat region ( BAP/TFII-I ( 4F ) ) , mutants carrying phenylalanine substitutions for tyrosines 248 ( Y248F ) , 277 ( Y277F ) , and 248 and 277 ( Y248F , Y277F ) were tested .
The pattern of tryptic phosphopeptides obtained from BAP/TFII-I ( Y277F ) ( Fig .
5A , lane 3 ) was identical to that of wild-type BAP/TFII-I ( Fig .
54 , lane 1 ) .
In contrast , at least one tryptic phosphopeptide present in the wild-type protein was eliminated by the Y248F mutation ( Fig .
5A , lane 2 ; filled arrow ) .
The appearance of a novel species , which probably represents a partial proteolytic fragment , is correlated with the Y248F mutation ( Zanes 2 , 4 , and 5 , open arrow ) .
Mutation of additional tyrosines had no further effect on the pattern of tryptic phosphopeptides , since the profiles obtained for BAP/ TFII-I ( Y248F , Y277F ) and BAP/TFII-I ( 4F ) are identical to that of the Y248F mutant ( Fig .
5A , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
We conclude that Tyr '' ( Fig .
5D ) is a site of phosphorylation by Btk in vitro .
Four tyrosine residues , Tyr®* '' , Tyr®** , Tyr® '' '' , and Tyr® '' * , lie within the second HLH-like repeat of BAP/TFII-I .
To determine sites of phosphorylation in this region , the corresponding phenylalanine substitutions were introduced into BAP/TFII-I , 27811 and their effects on tryptic phosphopeptide patterns were analyzed ( Fig .
5B ) .
In addition , the double Y346F , Y357F mutant was analyzed because these residues lie within a single tryptic fragment .
The Y357F mutation was sufficient to eliminate the two predominant phosphopeptides present in the wild-type substrate ( Fig .
5B , compare lanes 4 and 1 ) .
Mutation of Tyr®** had no additional effect ( Fig .
5B , lane 5 ) .
The phosphopeptide pattern was unchanged by individual mutations at Tyr®* '' , Tyr '' , or Tyr®'* .
We conclude that Tyr '' ( Fig .
5D ) is phosphorylated by Btk in vitro .
Similar mutational analysis revealed that residue Tyr'© '' , which lies within the third HLH-like repeat , is phosphorylated in vitro by Btk , because a Y462F mutation , in the context of full-length BAP/TFII-I , eliminated both of the tryptic phosphopeptide fragments specific to this region ( Fig .
5C , compare lane 3 with lanes 6 and 7 ; relevant peptides are marked by closed arrows ) .
Mutation of residues Tyr** '' and Tyr* '' ® did not alter the tryptic phosphopeptide pattern , relative to that of the wild-type protein ( Fig .
5C , lanes 2 and 5 ) .
Moreover , the phosphopeptide pattern of the Y451F , Y462F double mutant was identical to that of the Y462F single mutant .
Thus Tyr** ( Fig .
5D ) is the predominant site of in vitro phosphorylation by Btk within the third HLH-like region of BAP/TFII-L. To determine the contribution of Btk phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I at the identified sites relative to total phosphorylation by Btk in vitro , BAP/TFII-I full-length protein bearing phenylalanine mutations at residues Tyr®** , Tyr® '' '' , and Tyr*4* ?
( BAP/TFII-I ( 3YF ) ) was expressed in E. coli and purified in parallel with the wild-type BAP/TFII-I protein ( Fig .
5D ) .
BAP/ TFII-I ( 3YF ) was phosphorylated to a substantially lesser extent than the wild-type protein in in vifro kinase reactions performed in duplicate with MBP-Btk ; control reactions were run in the presence of kinase-defective MBP-Btk ( K4830E ) ( Fig .
56 ) .
Quantitation of phosphorylated products ( Fig .
5F ) indicated that the majority of Btk-specific phosphorylation was eliminated by the mutation of Tyr '' , Tyr® '' '' , and Tyr* '' to phenylalanine .
The Btk-specific phosphorylation remaining in BAP/TFII-I ( 3YEF ) is consistent with data presented in Fig .
44 , which indicated that at least one site for Btk phosphorylation resides outside of the N-3R region of BAP/TFII-I .
Correspondence between Phosphorylation Sites in Vitro and in Vivo-We next wished to determine whether the phosphorylation sites defined in vitro correspond to sites at which BAP/TFII-I is hyperphosphorylated in vivo upon cotransfection of Btk .
Epitope-tagged BAP/TFII-I or the BAP N-3R fragment was expressed in 293 cells with cotransfected Btk or kinase-inactive Btk ( K430E ) .
Protein was labeled metabolically with °°P and recovered by immunoprecipitation with an anti-c-Mye antibody .
Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and radiolabeled BAP/TFII-I species were isolated .
Phosphoamino acid analysis of gel-purified BAP/ TFII-I revealed the presence of radiolabeled phosphotyrosine upon coexpression with active Btk but not with Btk ( K430E ) ( data not shown ) .
Tryptic digestion of BAP N-3R , labeled in vivo , revealed that a subset of peptides were preferentially phosphorylated in the presence of Btk , relative to Btk ( KA430E ) ( Fig .
6A , compare lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The majority of these phosphopeptides corresponded to tryptic fragments phosphorylated by Btk in vitro ( Fig .
6A , lane 1 ; relevant peptides are marked by arrows ) , consistent with the interpretation that they contain target sites for direct phosphorylation by Btk in vivo .
The major sites at which BAP/TFII-I is hyperphosphorylated upon cotransfection with Btk were determined by site-directed mutagenesis ( Figs .
6 , B and C ) .
A Btk-enhanced , in vivo labeled phosphopeptide from BAP N-3R was absent in the BAP N-3R ( 4F ) mutant ( Fig .

Phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I at residues Tyr®* '' , Tyr® '' , and Tyr** > by Btk in vitro .
Full-length wild-type or mutant BAP/TFIL-I was purified and phosphorylated in vitro by MBP-Btk .
Products were analyzed by one-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping .

The Y357F mutation eliminated two prominent tryptic phosphopeptides ( closed arrows ) .
C , the third HLH-like domain of BAP/TFII-I is phosphorylated by Btk at Tyr** '' in vitro .
Lane 1 , wild-type protein ; lane 2 , BAP/TFII-I ( Y419F ) ; lane 3 , BAP/TFII-I ( Y462F ) ; lane 4 , BAP/TFII-I ( Y451F , Y462F ) ; lane 5 , BAP/TFII-I ( Y478F ) ; lane 6 , BAP/TFII-I N-2R ; lane 7 , BAP/TFII-L N-3R .
Comparison of lanes 6 and 7 identifies phosphopeptides derived from the third HLH-like domain that are present in the wild-type protein ( closed arrows ) .
These phosphopeptides were eliminated by mutation of Tyr '' alone ( Zane 3 ) or in combination with Tyr* '' ( lane 4 ) .
D , purified BAP/TFII-I and Y248F , Y357F , Y462F BAP/TFII-I ( 3YF ) .

£ , phosphorylation of full-length BAP/TFII-I and mutant BAP/TFII-I ( Y248F , Y357F , Y462F ) proteins by MBP-Btk in vitro .
MBP-Btk ( lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , and 9 ) or MBP-Btk ( K4830E ) ( anes 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , and 10 ) were incubated with equivalent amounts of purified BAP/TFII-I ( WT ) ( Zanes 1-4 ) or 3YF ( lanes 5-8 ) or without BAP/TFII-I ( Zanes 9 and 10 ) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.2 ) , 2 mm MnCl , 1 mM Na , MoO0 , , and 10 uCi of [ y-*P ] ATP for 80 min at 87 °C .
Products were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to PVDF , and detected by PhosphorImager .
Phosphorylated BAP/TFII-I ( BAP ) and autophosphorylated MBP-Btk are indicated .
F , phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I in vitro by Btk is reduced in the BAP/TFII-I ( Y248F , Y857F , Y462F ) mutant .
Radiolabeled substrates were excised from the PVDF membranes in E , and radioactivity ( Cerenkov ) was quantitated .
The results of two independent experiments are plotted .

peptide is marked by the open arrow ) , consistent with identification of Tyr® '' * '' as a target site for Btk in vitro .
A pair of Btk-independent radiolabeled phosphopeptides ( Fig .
6B , lanes 1 and 2 , closed circles ) are absent in the BAP N-3R ( 4F ) mutant and its derivatives ( Fig .
6B , lanes 3-6 ) , indicating that one or more of the four tyrosines in the second nonrepeat region of BAP/TFII-I is a target for phosphorylation by an endogenous tyrosine kinase other than Btk .
Additional mutation of Tyr** ' and Tyr** > to phenylalanine eliminated a Btk-dependent phosphopeptide ( Fig .
6B , closed arrow ) , consistent with the identification of Tyr*© '' as a target for Btk phosphorylation in vitro .
Last , examination of the in vivo phosphopeptide pattern from full-length BAP/TFII-I revealed that a Btk-dependent species was absent from BAP/TFII-I ( Y357F ) but unperturbed by mutations at Tyr®** , Tyr® '' '' , or Tyr*® ?
( Fig .
6C ) .
Thus , residue Tyr® '' '' of BAP/TFII-I is hyperphosphorylated in the presence of cotransfected Btk in vivo .
If residues Tyr® '' '' , and Tyr*© '' are indeed major sites of Btk phosphorylation within BAP/TFII-I in vivo , then BAP/ TFII-I ( 3YF ) , in which these residues are mutated , should exhibit reduced Btk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in transfected cells .
BAP/TFII-I N-3R became hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine when coexpressed with Btk in 293 cells ( Fig .
6D , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) .
This is in contrast to the mutant BAP/TFII-I N-3R ( 3YF ) , which showed no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation when coexpressed with Btk ( Fig .
6D , compare lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Quantitation indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation of unmutated BAP N-3R increased at least 2-fold in the presence of Btk , while there was no discernible Btk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the 3YF mutant ( Fig .
6KE ) .
We conclude that the major sites at which BAP/TFII-I is phosphorylated in mammalian cells upon cotransfection with Btk correspond to the predominant targets of phosphorylation by Btk in vitro .
To assess the functional significance of phosphorylation at residues Tyr®** , Tyr® '' '' , and we examined the transcriptional activity of wild-type and phenylalanine-substituted BAP/TFII-I on the c-fos promoter , which is responsive to BAP/ TFII-I ( 82 , 33 ) .
Transfection of COS-7 cells with wild-type BAP/TFII-I stimulated expression of the c-fos luciferase reporter gene relative to the vector-transfected control ( Fig .

type .
Interestingly , the effects of the combined mutations were not additive .
The debilitating effects of the phosphorylation site mutations were specific , as mutation of residue Tyr** '' , which is not phosphorylated by Btk in vitro or in vivo , had no effect on 610Z '01 Aepy uo 1san8 4g /S10-aqf / wroj ; 27814 BAP/TFII-I activity in this assay .
Btk has been shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of BAP/TFII-I at the c-fos promoter in fibroblastoid cell lines ( 82 ) .
In experiments presented above , transfection was performed under conditions that maximized the effect of BAP/ TFII-I on transcription from the c-fos promoter .
Under these conditions , mutation of Btk phosphorylation sites in BAP/ TFII-I reduced the stimulatory effect of BAP/TFII-I .
We next wanted to determine the effects of the same mutations on enhancement of BAP/TFII-I activity by Btk .
These experiments were performed using transfection conditions in which stimulation of c-fos activity was dependent on the presence of both BAP/TFII-I and Btk ( see `` Materials and Methods '' ) ; transfection of BAP/TFII-I in the absence of active Btk , or of Btk in the absence of BAP/TFII-I , had no effect on c-fos promoter activity ( Fig .
7C ) .
Mutation of Tyr® '' '' , and to phenylalanine , singly or in combination , impaired ( Fig .
7C , Y462F and 3YF ) or eliminated ( Fig .
7C , Y248F and Y357F ) stimulation of c-fos promoter activity by Btk and BAP/TFII-I .
The BAP/TFII-I ( Y248F ) mutant , moreover , consistently suppressed basal expression of the c-fos reporter construct as well ( Fig .
7C ) .
These results are consistent with roles for residues Tyr®** and Tyr® '' '' , and perhaps also for Tyr** > , in mediating synergistic effects of BAP/TFII-I and Btk at the c-fos promoter .
DISCUSSION While the participation of Btk in signaling pathways essential to B cell development and activation is clear , relatively little is known concerning the targets of this kinase and the consequences of their phosphorylation .
BAP/TFII-I , phospho-lipase Cy , protein kinase CB , and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein have all been identified as possible Btk substrates in vivo ( 26 , 41-43 ) .
Until now , however , direct phosphorylation of these substrates by Btk has not been documented .
Results presented in this communication suggest strongly that Btk is capable of phosphorylating BAP/TFII-I directly , thereby providing one means by which Btk activation may mediate cellular responses to antigen receptor engagement .
Several lines of evidence support this conclusion .
First , BAP/ TFII-I is a substrate for bacterially expressed , purified Btk in vitro .
Second , there exists a correspondence between tryptic phosphopeptides from BAP/TFII-I phosphorylated by Btk in vitro and Btk-dependent tryptic phosphopeptides from BAP/ TFII-I expressed in mammalian cells .
Third , mutation of BAP/ TFII-I at tyrosine residues phosphorylated by Btk in vitro eliminated Btk-dependent phosphopeptides from metabolically labeled BAP/TFII-I .
We have relied on deletion and point mutagenesis to locate sites of protein phosphorylation .
In pursuing this approach , we considered the possibility that truncation might permit phosphorylation at sites that are inaccessible in the intact protein or that a point mutation might indirectly impair phosphorylation at a different residue .
In the studies presented here , however , the predominant patterns of phosphorylation within individual BAP/TFII-I fragments were recapitulated in the full-length protein , arguing that truncation did not generate artifactual phosphorylation sites .
Moreover , within each phosphorylated region of BAP/TFII-I , as defined by nested trunca-tions , mutation of a single tyrosine residue affected phosphorylation , eliminating only phosphopeptides mapping to that region .
Taken together , these observations are consistent with the interpretation that tyrosine residues 248 , 357 , and 462 of BAP/TFII-I represent sites of direct phosphorylation by Btk .
We note , however , that identification of phosphorylation sites by the methods employed here is limited by the stoichiometry of phosphorylation and , in the case of metabolic labeling , by the flux of phosphate through tyrosine .
Thus , we can not exclude Btk Phosphorylation Sites in BAP/TFILI-I the existence of additional Btk target sites within BAP/TFII-I .
The substrate specificities of Btk and other tyrosine kinases of the Tec family are as yet poorly defined .
Of the three residues of BAP/TFII-I shown here to be phosphorylated by Btk ( Fig .
7D ) , two ( Tyr® '' '' and Tyr*® ? )
occur in similar sequence contexts ( nine identities among the 11 residues from the -5-position through the +5-position ) within the loop regions of consecutive HLH-like domains .
The context of Tyr®** is dis-tinct , differing from the corresponding sequence surrounding Tyr® '' '' in all of the 11 residues from -5 through +5 , except the target tyrosine .
The contexts of all three Btk phosphorylation sites in BAP/TFII-I differ substantially from that of the Btk autophosphorylation site at Tyr® '' '' ( 22 ) .
Thus , any features of primary sequence that might confer specificity for Btk remain obscure .
BAP/TFII-I is able to associate with Btk and other kinases in vivo ( 26 , 44 ) , and Btk has a modest stimulatory effect on transcriptional activation by BAP/TFII-I in transfected cells ( 82 ) .
These observations as well as an apparent requirement for phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I in transcriptional assays in vitro ( 81 ) have suggested that Btk and perhaps other kinases may regulate the activity of BAP/TFII-I .
In support of this possibility , a BAP/TFII-I mutant carrying phenylalanine substitutions at both Tyr®** and Tyr®* '' exhibited impaired transcriptional activity in transfected cells ( 32 ) .
Although the Btk dependence of BAP/TFII-I activity was not addressed in that study , one interpretation is suggested by our identification of Tyr®* '' as a target site for phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I .
The effect of the mutations at Tyr®* '' and Tyr®* '' on transcription , however , would also be consistent with phosphorylation at Tyr '' by a kinase other than Btk , including members of the Tec family that are more broadly expressed .
Consistent with this notion , we have observed that overexpression of the BAP/ TFII-I ( Y248F ) mutant consistently impairs basal expression from a transfected c-fos reporter construct ( Fig .
7A ) .
Our findings suggest that two other Btk targets within BAP/TFII-I , residues Tyr® '' '' and Tyr** '' , may be phosphorylated by more broadly expressed kinases as well , because phenylalanine substitutions at these sites also impair Btk-independent transcription from the c-fos promoter ( Fig .
7A ) .
Our studies implicate phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I at residues Tyr®** and Tyr '' , and perhaps at Tyr** > , in Btk-dependent stimulation of transcription from the c-fos promoter .
Interestingly , the debilitating effects of these mutations were not additive .
This suggests the existence of one or more functional interactions among these three sites ; an understanding of these interactions may warrant further study .
Two of the Btk phosphorylation sites within BAP/TFII-I occur within loop regions of helix-loop-helix-like domains .
This suggests that these loop domains are available for modification by phosphorylation and perhaps for interactions with other proteins .
BAP/TFII-I promotes the formation of a ternary complex involving serum response factor , Phox1 and the c-fos promoter ( 28 ) .
On this basis , BAP/TFII-I has been proposed to act as a scaffold that assists in the assembly of multicomponent transcription complexes ( 28 , 33 ) .
Phosphorylation of BAP/ TFII-I , in particular within the loop regions of HLH-like domains , may facilitate the construction of such complexes , perhaps through the creation of binding sites for specific proteins .
