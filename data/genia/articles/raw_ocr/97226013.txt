NO is produced from at least three different NO synthase ( NOS ) isoforms : neuronal NOS ( nNOS ) , endothelial NOS , and immunologic NOS ( INOS ) .
We show that nNOS is the predominant isoform constitutively expressed in glia .
NO derived from nNOS in glia inhibits the transcription factor nuclear factor « B ( NFB ) as NOS inhibitors enhance basal NFB activation .
Pyrrolidine dithiocar-bamate ( PDTC ) is an inhibitor of NFB in most cells ; however , we show that PDTC is also a potent scavenger of NO through formation of mononitrosyl iron complexes with PDTC .
In Jurkat cells , a human T-cell lymphoma cell line , tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF-a ) induces NFB activation that is inhibited by PDTC .
Contrary to the results in Jurkat cells , PDTC did not inhibit tumor necrosis factor- & -induced NFB activation in astrocytes ; instead PDTC itself induces NFB activation in astrocytes , and this may be related to scavenging of endogenously produced NO by the PDTC iron complex .
In astrocytes PDTC also dramatically induces the NFKB-dependent enzyme , iNOS , supporting the physiologic relevance of endogenous NO regulation of NFB .
NFB activation in glia from mice lacking nNOS responds more rapidly to PDTC compared with astrocytes from wild-type mice .
Our data suggest that nNOS in astrocytes regulates NFB activity and iNOS expression , and indicate a novel regulatory role for nNOS in tonically suppressing central nervous system , NFKB-regulated genes .
Nitric oxide is a potent messenger molecule with diverse physiologic activities , including regulation of vascular tone , neurotransmission , and killing of microorganisms and tumor cells ( 1-3 ) .
NO is produced from L-arginine ( L-Arg ) by the enzyme NO synthase ( NOS ) .
A family of related NOS proteins are the products of different genes and include neuronal NOS ( nNOS , type 1 ) , immunologic NOS ( iNOS , type 2 ) , and endothelial NOS ( eNOS , type 3 ) ( 3 ) .
nNOS occurs in discreet neuronal populations in the brain and also is localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle ( 4 ) .
eNOS primarily has endothelial cell localizations , but also is localized to a variety of other tissue types , including CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus ( 5 ) .
Both nNOS and eNOS are constitutively expressed and are calcium-calmodulin-dependent enzymes ( 3 , 4 ) .
iNOS is expressed in response to cytokines , lipopolysac-charide ( LPS ) , and a host of other agents ( 6 , 7 ) .
iNOS has been localized to a variety of cell types upon appropriate immunologic stimulation ( 6 , 7 ) .
The key to regulation of NO production by iNOS is through regulation of transcription ( 8 , 9 ) .

2676 Characterization of the promoter region of the gene for iNOS reveals a complex pattern of regulation ( 8-12 ) .
Upstream from the transcription start site are distinct regulatory regions , including LPS-related response elements , binding sites for NFxB , and y-interferon motifs ( 8-11 ) .
Recent studies indicate that NO transcriptionally inhibits iNOS mRNA expression in astrocytes ( 13 ) .
However , the mechanism by which NO transcriptionally regulates iNOS expression has not been clarified .
Preliminary studies showed that exogenously applied NO inhibits the activation of NFxB ( 14 , 15 ) .
Thus , we wondered whether NO inhibition of NFxB could regulate the expression of iNOS .
We now report that endogenous NO regulates the transcription factor NFxB , and through this regulation modulates the expression of iNOS .
Moreover , we show that type I ( nNOS ) in glia tonically suppresses NFB activity and transcriptionally regulates iNOS expression .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Cultures .
Primary mixed glial cell cultures were prepared from postnatal day 0-3 Lewis rats as described ( 16 ) .
Briefly , the cortex was dissected under a microscope in Brooks-Logan dissecting solution .
After dissection , the cortical tissue was placed in 0.25 % trypsin solution at 37°C for 30 min .
The trypsin solution was removed , and DMEM ( GIBCO / BRL ) with 20 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( GIBCO/BRL ) and 2 mM L-glutamine ( GIBCO/BRL ) was added to the cortical tissue suspension .
The cells were dissociated by trituration through 9-inch Pasteur pipettes until the solution was cloudy .
The suspended cells were plated on 75-em > flasks coated with polyornithine and placed in an 8 % CO ; humidified 37°C incubator .
After 2 days in culture , the medium was changed to DMEM , 10 % FBS , and 2 mM glutamine .
The medium was changed twice per week , and the cultures were allowed to mature to confluence ( approximately 1 week ) before being used for the experiments .
To examine the role of nNOS in NFxB activation , primary mixed glial cell cultures also were prepared from day 0-3 pups of wild-type mice and mutant mice lacking the gene for nNOS ( 17 ) .

Jurkat cells were plated on 75-em flasks and grown in a 5 % CO ; humidified 37°C incubator .
Cultures were treated with the various agents as indicated in the text and figure legends .
Measurement of Nitrite Formation .
To remove any trace of phenol red , the cell cultures were washed gently with Griess medium .
Griess medium consisted of DMEM without glucose , glutamine , phenol red , sodium bicarbonate , and sodium pyru-vate with the following additions : 0.4 mM MgSQO4 , 20 mM NaHCOs , 12 mM D-glucose , 0.5 mM pyruvic acid , and 0.4 mM CaCl ; , .
After the exposure period , culture media were harvested for the colorimetric determination of nitrite concentration by comparison to nitrite standards ( 16 ) .
Northern Blot Analysis .
Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells with the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method ( 18 ) .
Northern blot analysis was done as described ( 19 ) .
Equal amounts of total RNA ( 5 pug/lane ) were separated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to positively charged nylon membranes ( Hybond-N , Amersham ) .
The membrane was hybridized with a *°P -labeled random-primed probe made to rat iNOS and B-actin .
Hybridized filters were washed at 65°C in 0.1 % standard saline citrate ( 1x SSC = 0.15 M sodium chloride/0.015 m sodium citrate , pH 7 ) and 0.1 % SDS .
The membrane then was exposed to a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) screen , and the bands were quantitated .
Western Blot Analysis .
Cell culture plates were washed twice with ice-cold PBS .
Cells were harvested by being scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer [ 50 mM TrisHCl , pH 7.4/1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol/1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) /1 mM benzamidine/10 pg/ml pepstatin A/1 pg/ml aprotinin/1 mM EDTA ] .
The cell lysate was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and incubated on ice for 60 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C .
The supernatant fluid ( total cell lysate ) was used for Western blot analysis .
Western blot analysis was carried out using 50 ug of the total cell lysates .
Proteins were electroblotted from SDS-polyacrylamide gels onto Immobilon-P membranes .
The membrane was blocked with 5 % skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature .
Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antisera to iNOS and mouse polyclonal antiserum to nNOS and eNOS were from Transduction Laboratories ( Lexington , KY ) .
The blots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in PBS buffer containing 3 % BSA .
The blots were washed four times with 5 % skim milk in PBS and then incubated with secondary antibody ( 1:5,000 dilution ) coupled to horseradish peroxidase .
Immunodetection was accomplished using a Lu-miglo Substrate Kit ( Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories ) for chemiluminescent detection .
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Supershift Analysis .
The 26-mer oligonucleotide from the major histocompatibility complex class I promoter , including the consensus binding site for NFkB ( 5-GATCCAGAGGGGACTTTC-CGAGAGGA-3 '' ) , was used for gel shifts ( 20 ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
The NFxB binding oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [ y-*PJATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase ( New England Biolabs ) , and purified by G-50 Sephadex columns ( Pharmacia ) .
Confluent cultured glial cells and Jurkat cells were harvested with ice-cold hypoosmotic buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7.8/10 mM KCI/2 mM MgCl ; /0.1 mM EDTA/10 ug/ml aprotinin/0.5 pg/ml leupeptin/3 mM PMSF/3 mM DTT ) after stimulation .
The cells in the hypotonic buffer were incubated for 17 min on ice .
Nonidet P-40 was added , and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge .
The supernatants containing the cyto-plasmic proteins were removed and stored at -70°C .
The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in a high-salt buffer [ 50 mM Hepes , pH 7.4/50 mM KCI/300 mM NaCl/0.1 mM EDTA/ 10 % ( vol/vol ) glycerol/3 mM DTT/3 mM PMSF ] to solubilize Proc .

The extracts were spun in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 10 min , and the clear supernatants containing nuclear protein were aliquoted and stored at -70°C .
Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 15 min using 6-8 ug of nuclear protein and 0.25 ng ( 25,000 cpm ) of labeled oligonucleotide in 30 ul of binding buffer containing 10 mM TrisHCl , pH 7.5/50 mM NaCI1/50 mM KCl/1 mM MgCl ; /1 mM EDTA/S mM DTT/5 % glycerol/2 ug of poly ( dI-dC ) ( Pharmacia ) .
DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound probe on native 6.0 % polyacrylamide gels ( Bio-Rad ) at 200-250 V for 2 h. The resultant gel was vacuum-dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen .
Cold competition was performed using consensus ( 5'-GGGGACTTTCCC-3 ' ) or mutant NFB subunits p65 and p50 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
Supershift experiments were performed by adding NFB p65 or p50 antibody ( 1 or 2 wl ) to the binding mixture immediately after the addition of the radiolabeled NFB probe .
The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature , and the complexes were resolved as described above .

RESULTS Endogenous NO Inhibits NFB Activation .
To evaluate the role of endogenously produced NO effects on NFKB transcription we examined the effects of NOS inhibitors on electrophoretic mobility shift assays in astrocytes ( Fig .

L-NMMA ( 500 mM ) , a competitive NOS inhibitor , begins to enhance NFxB binding at 4 h , and at 24 h there is a dramatic increase in NFB binding .

( 4 ) Cultured glia were incubated with L-NMMA ( 500 uM ) , and NFxB-binding activity was measured at 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , and 24 h after treatment .
L-NMMA begins to enhance NFkB activity at 4 h , and at 24 h there is a dramatic increase in NFxB-binding activity .
Excess L-Arg ( 5 mM ) completely reversed L-NMMA-induced NFB activation .

L-NMMA ( Fig .
1 ) .
The structurally unrelated inhibitor L-NS- ( 1-iminoethyl ) ornithine ( 250 mM ) also enhances NFB binding in a manner similar to L-NMMA ( data not shown ) .
To confirm that NO inhibits NFkB transcription we treated astrocytes with the potent NF kB activator LPS ( Fig .
1B ) .
LPS induces NFkB binding at 2 h with maximal induction at 4 h , which is sustained over the course of the 24-h treatment with LPS .
The highly selective NO donor , NOR-3 , potently inhibits NFxB activation at all time points ( Fig .
1B ) .
NOR-3 depleted of NO by incubating NOR-3 in culture media for several hours has no effect on LPS-induced NFB activation ( data not shown ) .
PDTC Differentially Regulates NFB Expression in Lymphocytes and Astrocytes .
PDTC is a potent inhibitor of NFB activation in intact cells ( 20 ) .
However , PDTC is also a potent scavenger of NO through formation of mononitrosyl iron complexes with PDTC ( 21 , 22 ) .
Thus , we wondered whether PDTC would differentially regulate NFB activation in cells that constitutively express NOS at low levels ( 23 ) versus cells that express NOS at relatively higher levels .
The human T-cell line , Jurkat cells , express eNOS constitutively at very low levels ( 23 ) , whereas astrocytes contain relatively higher levels of constitutive NOS ( 24 ) .
Similar to previous reports , TNF-a in Jurkat cells induces NFKB activation at 30 min , which diminishes over time to modest increases over baseline at 240 min ( Fig .
2 ) ( 25 ) .
PDTC dramatically inhibits NFB activation at all time points ( Fig .
24 ) .
In contrast , PDTC does not inhibit TNF-a-induced NFKB in astrocytes ( Fig .
2B ) .
Astrocytes in response to TNF-a have sustained activation of NFKB and also appear to contain higher levels of P50 dimer than Jurkat cells ( Fig .
2 ) .
PDTC Induces NFB Activation in Astrocytes .
Because PDTC fails to inhibit TNF- « @ -induced NFB activation in astrocytes , this prompted us to further evaluate the effects of PDTC on NFKB activation in astrocytes .
LPS potently activated NFB binding in astrocytes at 2 h , and NFxB binding continues to increase up to 24 h after LPS administration .

USA 94 ( 1997 ) Interestingly , at 2 h PDTC enhances LPS-mediated activation of NFB .
The enhancement of LPS-stimulated NFB binding by PDTC is present at 4 h and 6 h ( Fig .
34 ) .
At 8 to 24 h PDTC modestly inhibits LPS-stimulated NFB binding ( Fig .
34 ) .
There are no differences in cell viability among control , LPS , PDTC plus LPS , and PDTC groups ( data not shown ) .
Strik-ingly , PDTC alone activates NFxB binding at 2 h with effects diminishing at 6 h of PDTC treatment ( Fig .
34 ) .
Confirmation of the specificity of NFB activation by PDTC is the complete elimination of NFxB binding by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide and the failure of a mutant oligonucleotide to compete for NFB binding ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , anti-P65 and anti-P50 antibodies to NFxB subunits abolish the NFkB band and cause further gel retardation ( supershift ) ( data not shown ) .
We investigated the potential mechanism by which PDTC enhances NFxB binding in astrocytes ( Fig .
3B ) .
PDTC is an effective scavenger of NO formation as indicated by its ability to inhibit nitrite formation by NOR-3 ( Fig .
3B ) .
PDTC enhancement of NFB is dose dependently blocked by NOR-3 , which effectively counteracts the NO-scavenging capabilities of PDTC ( Fig .
3C ) .
PDTC is thought to scavenge NO through forming mononitrosyl iron complexes with PDTC ( 21 , 22 ) .

PDTC enhances NFxB binding in glia by scavenging NO .
( A ) Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that LPS ( 60 ng/ml ) potently activates NFxB binding in astrocytes at 2 h , and this activation continues to 24 h. PDTC ( 100 uM ) enhances LPS-mediated NFkB activation for the first 6 h after LPS administration .
At 8 to 24 h PDTC modestly inhibits LPS-stimulated NFB binding .
Notably , PDTC ( 100 M ) alone activates NFB binding at 2 h with effects diminishing at 6 h of PDTC treatment .

in astrocytes .
BPS alone has minimal effects on NFxB binding in astrocytes ( Fig .
3D ) ; however , we can not exclude the possibility that BPS is acting as a scavenger of NO .
Although our results suggest that PDTC is enhancing NFB activity through scavenging of NO through the formation of mononitrosyl iron complexes , we can not exclude the possibility that it is inhibiting superoxide dismutase or inhibiting the Fenton reaction .
Constitutive NOS Regulates iNOS Expression .
To explore the physiologic relevance of NO-regulated NFKB transcription we examined the effects of PDTC on the NFKB-regulated gene , iNOS ( 8-12 ) ( Fig .
44 ) .
PDTC dramatically induces iNOS expression in astrocytes with iNOS protein being detectable at 4 h after PDTC treatment .
Maximal iNOS protein levels are present at 8 h and begin to diminish at 16 h with almost complete loss of iNOS levels after 24 h of PDTC treatment ( Fig .
44 ) .
To further examine the role of PDTC regulation of NFB and iNOS we examined the effects of PDTC on LPS-stimulated NO formation by iNOS ( Fig .
4 B-D ) .
Similar to previous observations LPS potently stimulates NO formation in astrocyte cultures ( Fig .
4B ) .
Consistent with the notion that PDTC scavenges NO and enhances NFB activity is the ability of PDTC to diminish nitrite levels in LPS-stimulated cultures without affecting the levels of iNOS mRNA or protein ( Fig .
4 B-D ) .
nNOS Regulates NFB Transcription in Astrocytes .
To ascertain the source of NO that accounts for regulation of NFkB transcription we conducted Western blot analysis on glial cultures .
Glia constitutively express nNOS and contain barely detectable levels of eNOS , and at baseline iNOS is undetectable ( Fig .
54 ) .
Because nNOS is the major isoform that is constitutively expressed , we examined the effects of PDTC modulation of NFxB transcription in cultures derived from mice lacking the gene for nNOS and compared it to cultures derived from wild-type animals .
As previously shown , PDTC induces NFB activation in wild-type cultures at 120 min .
In contrast , PDTC in nNOS astrocyte cultures massively induces NFxB after 30 min of treatment , and at 2 h NFkB is dramatically induced when compared with wild-type animals A PDTC C _ LPS- ++ Time ( hr ) 0 2 4 6 816 24PC PP b i+ f10- am- s- < iNOS B 38 25° \ WW Lincs 25 185 3 20 3. o 15 B-actin ® = = S D z 10 LPS 1 4 i PDTC - .

( Fig .

Thus , NO derived from the neuronal form of NOS seems to be a major regulator of NFxB transcription in glial cultures .
DISCUSSION Our findings indicate that NO derived from type 1 ( nNOS ) in glia inhibits NFKB activation , confirming previous reports that exogenous NO can regulate and inhibit NFB activity ( 14 , 15 ) .
Furthermore , we show that endogenously derived NO inhibits NFxB-binding activity , because competitive NOS inhibitors enhance NFB binding , and excess substrate L-Arg reverses the enhancement of NFxB binding by NOS inhibitors in intact cells .
PDTC , a well known inhibitor of NFB binding in nonneuronal tissue ( 20 ) , enhances NFxB binding in astrocytes through scavenging of NO .
This activation of NFkB induces iNOS expression in astrocytes .
The source of endogenously derived NO that regulates NFxB binding in astrocytes appears to be nNOS as astrocytes predominantly express nNOS and contain negligible quantities of eNOS and iNOS .
NFB binding is also more effectively induced at an earlier time point by the NO scavenging effects of PDTC in mutant mice lacking nNOS when compared with wild-type mice .
One pathway toward NFxB binding activity is its transloca-tion to the nucleus through degradation of inhibitory protein « B ( IxB ) ( 26 , 27 ) .
Although it is not well clarified , IxB degradation is regulated by serine phosphorylation and ubiquination ( 27 ) .
Recent studies suggest that exogenously applied NO may inhibit NFB binding in endothelial cells through stabilization of IkB-a or through increased transcription of IkB-a ( 14 ) .
Alternatively NO may directly inhibit NFB through S-nitrosylation of the cysteine-62 residue of p50 ( 28 ) .
PDTC is a potent inhibitor of NFB binding in nonneuronal tissue such as Jurkat cells ( 25 ) .
In contrast , PDTC fails to inhibit NFB binding in astrocytes after either TNF-a @ - or LPS-induced NFkB binding .
PDTC suppression of NFB binding in nonneuronal tissues is thought to be due to inhibition of the release of IxB through either its metal chelating or antioxidative properties .
The molecular mechanisms underlying the differential regulation of NFkB in astrocytes versus lymphocytes is not known .
It is possible that the inability of PDTC to enhance NFkB binding in lymphocytes may be 2680 Neurobiology : Togashi et al .
related to the relatively low levels of constitutive expression of NOS in this cell line .
Alternatively , the relatively low levels of P50 in Jurkat cells ( 25 ) in contrast to the high levels of P50 in astrocytes may account for the differential regulation of NFB binding by PDTC .
nNOS is primarily localized to neurons throughout the peripheral and central nervous system ( 29 ) .
Recent studies indicate that nNOS is also localized in skeletal muscle , pancreatic islets , endometrium , and respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelium ( 4 ) .
nNOS in neurons may play a role in neurotransmitter release , neural development , synaptic plas-ticity , and regulation of gene expression .
Previous reports indicated constitutive expression of NOS in astrocytes ( 24 ) ; however , the isoform and physiologic role of NOS in astrocytes was not clarified .
We show that nNOS is the predominant isoform in astrocytes , implicating nNOS in a new physiologic role .
nNOS in astrocytes constitutively generates NO to repress the NFB redox-sensitive transcription factor and regulates the expression of genes such as iNOS .
Because NFB regulates the transcription of several `` inflam-matory '' genes such as iNOS , interleukin-6 , TNF-a , and major histocompatibility complex class I and II ( 30 ) , constitutive NO derived from nNOS in astrocytes may tonically inhibit inflammatory processes through gene regulation .
Consistent with this notion are our observations that scavenging of NO and inhibition of NOS activates NFB binding and induces iNOS .
Furthermore , NFKB activation is readily induced in astrocytes from mice lacking the gene for nNOS .
Thus , NO derived from nNOS in glia subserves a novel redox-signaling role through regulation of NFB activity .
NO may be regulating NFkB through both intracellular and intercellular signaling .
In the nervous system astrocytes may be regulating NFKB through NO acting intercellularly .
However , the major source of NO in vivo would be derived from nNOS containing neurons , which could regulate NFxB through cell-to-cell signaling .
Because NO is a freely diffusible messenger molecule , NO could regulate NFB through intracellular interactions in nonneuronal tissue as well .
These observations may have clinical relevance in which inhibition of NOS is contemplated in diseases such as multiple sclerosis ( 31 ) and severe AIDS dementia ( 32 ) where iNOS is elevated .
