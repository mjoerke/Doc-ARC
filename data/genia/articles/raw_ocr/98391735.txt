Brown , Edward M. Rogers and Jeremy M. Boss* Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Emory University School of Medicine , Atlanta , GA 30322 , USA Received June 17 , 1998 ; Accepted July 26 , 1998 ABSTRACT The class II transactivator CIITA is required for transcriptional activation of the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes .
Aside from an N-terminal acidic transcriptional activation domain , little is known about how this factor functions .
Extensive mutagenesis of CIITA was undertaken to identify structural motifs required for function .
The ability of mutants to activate a reporter gene under the control of MHC class II conserved W-X-Y or X-Y regulatory elements was determined .
Two mutants displayed differential activity between the two promoters , activating transcription with the W-X-Y but not the X-Y elements .
All mutants were tested for their ability to interfere with wild-type CIITA activity .
Five CIITA mutant constructions were able to down-regulate wild-type CIITA activity .
Three of these mutants contained targeted disruptions of potential functional motifs : the acidic activation domain , a putative GTP-binding motif and two leucine charged domains ( LCD motifs ) .
The other two contained mutations in regions that do not have homology to described proteins .
The characterization of CIITA mutants that are able to discriminate between promoters with or without the W box strongly suggests that CIITA requires such interactions for function .
The identification of LCD motifs required for CIITA function brings to light a previously undefined role of these motifs in CIITA function .
INTRODUCTION Major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes encode integral components of the immune response .
The three human class II isotypes , DR , DQ and DP , each consisting of an O/B heterodimer , present processed extracellular antigenic peptides to helper T cells ( 1 ) .
Class II genes are coordinately expressed in B cells , macrophages , dendritic cells and thymic epithelium .
However , their expression can be induced in a number of cell types by treatment with interferon-y ( IFN-y ) ( 2-5 ) .
The temporal and spatial regulation of class II gene expression is vital to the maintenance of a functional immune system .
Clues to the mechanism of class II gene regulation have come from analyses of cell lines from patients exhibiting the bare lymphocyte syndrome ( BLS ) , an inherited immunodeficiency ( reviewed in 6,7 ) .
BLS patients lack all class II expression , resulting in an inability to mount an immune response to soluble antigens ( 8,9 ) .
Four clear BLS complementation groups have been defined , each deficient in a necessary trans-acting factor ( 6,10,11 ) .
The promoters of class II genes contain three conserved regulatory elements , termed the W , X and Y boxes ( 3,12 ) .
The W box is the most upstream of the elements and is required for IFN-y-induced and maximal B cell expression of class II genes ( 13-17 ) .
While the role of the W box in IFN-y induction has been well documented ( 16,17 ) , the mechanism for this requirement has remained elusive , presumably because the factors that bind to the W box have not been well characterized .
A recent report suggested that RFX , a factor that binds to the X1 box ( see below ) , binds weakly to the smaller S box region within the W box ( 18 ) .
The X box , both necessary and sufficient for class II expression in B cells ( 14,15,19 ) , has been biochemically and genetically subdivided into the X1 and X2 boxes ( 13,14 ) .
RFX , a multimeric protein complex consisting of 75 , 41 and 36 kDa subunits , binds to the X1 box ( 20,21 ) .
RFX activity is deficient in three of the BLS complementation groups ( B , C and D ) ( 13,21-25 ) .
The factor X2BP has been shown to bind the X2 box and has been described ( 26-29 ) .
The Y box , an inverted CCAAT motif , has been shown to bind the minor groove DNA-binding protein NF-Y ( 30 ) .
The X and Y box factors form synergistic complexes on all class II promoters ( 28,31 ) and therefore appear to coordinate the regulation of all class II genes .
The class II transactivator CIITA appears to function as a master regulatory switch for class II expression .
CIITA is mutated in BLS complementation group A ( 32 ) .
Expression of CITA correlates exactly with class II expression in both antigen-presenting cells and cells induced to express class II genes by IFN-y ( 32 ) .
Moreover , class II negative cells transfected with CITA express class II genes ( 33-37 ) , suggesting that CITA expression is a limiting component of class II gene regulation .
CIITA does not appear to bind DNA .
Analysis of the 1130 residue primary amino acid sequence of CIHITA ( 32 ) revealed an acidic region , a proline/serine/threonine-rich ( P/S/T ) region , a consensus GTP-binding motif ( 38 ) , a leucine-rich region and four leucine and charged residue-rich domains ( LCD ) .
The acidic domain has *To whom correspondence should be addressed .

been shown to act as a transcriptional activation domain in both mammalian and yeast systems ( 39,40 ) .
Mahanta et al .
( 41 ) recently showed that this transcriptional activation domain functions similarly to that of VP16 by interacting with the TATA-binding protein TBP and several TBP-associated factors .
No function has been ascribed to the P/S/T region , but it has been shown that it is required for CHTA activity ( 42 ) .
The mechanism for CHITA action is poorly understood ; recent studies have suggested that CIITA functions as a coactivator by interacting with X box DNA-bound transcription factors and activating transcription through its activation domain ( 39,40 ) .
To further investigate the mechanism of CITA function , a series of internal deletion and substitution mutants was created .
The mutants were tested for their ability to activate class II-specific reporter gene constructs and for their ability to interfere with the function of wild-type CIITA .
It was found that deletions spanning the C-terminal two thirds of the protein abrogated CIITA function .
Two mutants were found to discriminate between a W-X-Y-driven reporter and an X-Y reporter , suggesting direct interaction with the class II-specific transcription factor ( s ) bound at the W box ; both of these mutants contained disruptions of conserved LCD motifs , highlighting the potential involvement of these motifs in CITA function .
Numerous mutations resulted in proteins that were able to interfere with the function of wild-type CIITA , indicating that in addition to the activation domain , CHITA requires additional regions for activity .
Thus , the analysis of these mutants brings to light additional functions of CIITA , including the potential for interactions with the W box promoter element and a functional requirement for LCD motifs and neighboring residues .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture Raji is a B cell line derived from a patient with Burkitt 's lymphoma ( 43 ) .
RJ2.2.5 is an MHC class II negative derivative of Raji and was provided by Dr R. Acolla ( 44 ) .
Both cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco BRL , Grand Island , NY ) , supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( Intergen Inc. , Purchase , NY ) , 5 % calf serum ( Hyclone Inc. , Logan , UT ) , 2 mM L-glutamine ( Gibco BRL ) , 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin ( Gibco BRL ) .
CIITA plasmids Wild-type CITA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSVK3 ( Invitrogen Corp. , Carlsbad , CA ) , with an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag ( IBI , Corning , NY ) , which was used as the base vector for mutagenesis .
Overlap PCR ( OL-PCR ) mutagenesis was used to design the internal deletion and amino acid substitution mutants .
Two complementary overlap primers containing the desired mutation were used separately in PCRs with CHITA-specific primers 5° or 3 '' of the deletion ( Table 1 ) .
PCR products were mixed and used as template for OL-PCR amplification using the CIITA-specific primers .
The OL-PCR product was cloned into a wild-type CIITA background using available restriction sites ( all restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) .
Incorporation of mutations was monitored by ablation of restriction sites and all PCR-derived sequences were checked by DNA sequencing .
Zn vitro transcribed and translated proteins were prepared using the TnT kit ( Promega Corp. , Madison , WI ) as described by the manufacturer .
Transient transfections and CAT ELISAs CAT reporter constructs pDRW-X-Y and pDRGX1-X2-Y , containing the W-X-Y or X-Y motifs 5° of the minimal DRA promoter , respectively , were used ( 13,27 ) .
Co-transfections were performed by electroporation as previously described ( 27 ) .
For RJ2.2.5 transfections , cells were harvested 70 h post-transfection , washed , and lysed by three rounds of freezing and thawing .
CAT expression was measured by an ELISA ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
For Raji transfections , cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection , a time point determined by flow cytometry to be optimal for a dominant negative effect ( data not shown ) , washed , lysed , and assayed by ELISA as above .

Generation of ¢-CIITA antisera and immunoblot analysis A bacterial expressed maltose-binding protein-CIITA fusion protein ( MBP-CIITA ) was used to generate polyclonal antiserum .
CHTA-specific IgG antibodies were purified by chromatography over a protein A column as described by the manufacturer ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) .
Cell lysates were separated by 7.5 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes as described ( 45 ) .
Western blots were blocked overnight in 10 % non-fat dry milk ( w/v ) in PBS-T ( 0.1 % Tween-20 ) at room temperature with agitation .
Polyclonal o-CIITA antiserum was diluted 1:2000 in block solution ; blots were incubated in primary antibody solution for 1 h at room temperature with agitation .
Blots were washed in PBS-T and incubated for 1 h in secondary antibody ( HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG ; Sigma , St Louis , MO ) diluted 1:3000 in block solution .
Blots were washed as above and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL system ; Amersham Life Science , Arlington Heights , IL ) .
RESULTS CIITA deletion mutants To examine the nature of CITA function , a series of mutations were introduced into the CIITA gene that could be assayed for their ability to distinguish between wild-type and mutant class II promoters .
Small in-frame deletions beginning 3 '' of the acidic activation domain were created along the length of CIITA ( Fig .
1 ) .
The mutations were made downstream of the acidic activation domain for three reasons .
First , previous work had shown that this domain was required for transcriptional activation ( 39 ) .
Second , the non-functional allele of CIITA in the BLS complementation group A cell line RJ2.2.5 has a fully intact activation domain ( 46 ) , suggesting that CIITA has properties in addition to transcriptional activation .
Third , all complementation group A BLS patient-derived cell lines have mutations downstream of the activation domain ( 32,33 ) .
The predicted coding region of CIITA ( 32 ) was cloned into the pSVK eukaryotic expression vector , which had been modified to contain the FLAG epitope ( IBI , Corning , NY ) at its N-terminus .
The construction containing the wild-type CITA sequence was termed pFLAG-CIITA .
All other constructs were based on this vector .
Of the engineered mutations , some were randomly spaced along the length of the CIITA gene , while others targeted specific regions that potentially could affect function .
Two mutants , A3CIITA and ASCIITA , were designed to disrupt the G1 and G3 boxes , respectively , of the putative GTP-binding domain .
The ASCIITA deletion also eliminated one of the four consensus LCD motifs ( termed L1 ) of CHTA .
A10CIITA and A11CIHITA disrupt a leucine-rich region near the C-terminus of the protein .
Last , CHTA ( I61-1130 ) lacks the activation domain but retains all other sequences of CIITA , including the P/S/T region .
Two methods were used to confirm that the mutant constructs encoded the desired mutations .
First , all mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing .
Second , each construct was expressed in an in vitro transcription/translation reaction to ensure that the proteins produced were of the expected size ( Fig .
2A ) .
Because the FLAG epitope was unable to be detected by western blot when FLAG-CIITA was transfected into RJ2.2.5 or Raji cells , a CHTA-specific antiserum was developed to detect CIITA .
Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated to an Escherichia coli-expressed MBP-CIITA chimera .
Use of the MBP-CIITA fusion allowed stable and soluble expression of CITA in bacteria .
The antiserum recognizes CIITA in the wild-type Raji B cell line , but not in the CHTA-deficient cell line RJ2.2.5 ( Fig .
2B ) .
To determine if the CHITA mutant series would be expressed and stable in eukaryotic cells , immunoblot analysis was carried out on RJ2.2.5 cells transiently transfected with the mutant CIHITA constructs .
The results show that the CIITA mutant proteins can be detected at 24 h after transfection , suggesting that the overall levels of CHITA and the stability of the mutant proteins is similar to the wild-type ( Fig .
2C ) .

mutant is either slightly less stable or not produced in the same quantities as the others , as 1.5-fold more extract was required to generate a similar signal .
Most mutations in CIITA C-terminal of amino acid 377 result in the loss of CHTA activity The ability of the CIITA mutants to transactivate the X-Y box-dependent CAT reporter plasmid pDRG-X1-X2-Y ( 39 ) was determined by co-transfection into RJ2.2.5 cells .
The FLAG epitope had no effect on CIITA activity , as it gave comparable transactivation of the reporter as the previously characterized CIITA expression vector pCIITA-8 ( 39 ; Fig .
3A ) .
The ability of the CIITA mutants to transactivate pDRG-X1-X2-Y was assayed and normalized to the level of expression produced by the pFLAG-CIHITA construct ( Fig .
3A ) .
Most CIITA mutations resulted in non-functional alleles .
The only exceptions were the most N-terminal mutations , A1 and A2 , which both yielded near wild-type CAT levels as compared with pFLAG-CIITA .
Similar results were obtained when using CAT reporter constructs driven solely by the X1-X2 sequences ( data not shown ) .
To determine if any of the mutations could function in the presence of the W box , transfections were carried out using the previously described W-X-Y-dependent reporter construct pDRW-X-Y ( 13 ) .
Previous work from our laboratory indicated that the levels of CHTA-dependent transcription increased 2-3-fold when the W box was included in the promoter ( 27,39 ) .
This was also the case for CIITA transactivation in this system , as the reporter levels driven by pDRW-X-Y were 3.2-fold higher than those produced with pDRG-X1-X2-Y .
ASCIITA showed clear differences in transactivation capabilities between promoters driven by X1-X2-Y and W-X-Y .
Where A5 was inactive with an X-Y promoter , this mutant activated the W-X-Y reporter to 50.3 % of wild-type expression levels .
This differential activity for A5 suggests that this mutation alters the structure of CIITA in such a manner that it is now able to function only in the presence of the W box , implying that CIITA interacts with the W box proteins .
While other mutations also appear to show some W box-dependent activity ( e.g .
A7 and A9CIITA ) , this phenotype is most pronounced for ASCIITA .
Primary amino acid homology searches with CIITA highlighted a potential bipartite nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) in murine CIITA ( 47 ) and a conserved potential CDK phosphorylation site [ consensus SPxR ( 48 ) , CIITA positions Ser280 , Pro281 , Arg283 ] .
Individual mutations were created that deleted the potential NLS ( residues 141-160 of human CHTA ) and altered the conserved residues of the CDK phosphorylation site to alanines .
Both of these mutants were able to drive transcription to near wild-type levels in all assays tested ( data not shown ) .
Mutations in the activation domain and central regions of CIITA interfere with the function of wild-type CIITA in Raji cells Mutations that exhibit dominant negative effects often result from the disruption of a functional domain of the protein without disrupting other portions of the protein .
This class of mutants is able to interact with additional factors , but the resulting complexes are biologically inactive or non-functional .
To further analyze the mutant CIITA proteins , transient co-transfections of the CHTA mutants were carried out with the pDRW-X-Y reporter in Raji cells to test for dominant negative function of the mutants .
Transfection of the wild-type FLAG-CIITA construction in Raji cells resulted in an increase in expression of the reporter gene by a factor of 4.5 , indicating that CIITA is limiting even in the high class -expressing cell line Raji ( Fig .
4 ) .

Effects of CHTA mutations on class II transactivation .
CHTA~ RJ2.2.5 cells were used for transient transfections with 40 ug CIITA expression constructs and 20 ug either pDRG-X1-X2-Y ( A ) or pDRW-X-Y ( B ) reporter constructs .
A sample of 1 ug was included in all transfections to control for transfection efficiency .
Cell lysates were analyzed by CAT ELISA as described by the manufacturer ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) .
Results are given as a percentage of the level achieved using FLAG-CIITA with the reporter .
The dashed line in ( B ) ( pDR W-X-Y ) represents the level of reporter activity corresponding to 100 % activity of pDRG-X1-X2-Y in ( A ) .
The data represent averages from three independent assays , with SEM indicated .
transfection data in RJ2.2.5 cells shown in Figure 3A , transfection of A1 ( 373.8 % of baseline reporter levels ) , A2 ( 297.3 % ) and A5 ( 188.9 % ) resulted in proportional increases in expression of the reporter gene .
Transfection of CHITA mutants A3 ( 57.0 % ) , M ( 74.5 % ) , A7 ( 71.7 % ) and A8 ( 70.7 % ) resulted in significantly reduced levels of the class II reporter gene in Raji cells , indicating that these mutations were in regions that affected some but not all of CHTA function .
However , the most significant decrease in reporter levels resulted in transfections receiving CHITA ( 161-1130 ) ( 30.6 % ) , the mutant lacking the acidic activation domain .
The CHITA ( 161-1130 ) mutant was expected to function in a dominant negative manner as just the activation domain was deleted .
Thus , all other interactions are expected to be functional .
The A3 mutation specifically deletes the G1 motif of a putative GTP-binding domain , while mutations A4 , A7 and A8 are in regions of the molecule that do not show significant homology to described sequences .
The dominant negative nature of CHTA ( I61-1130 ) is similar to that of other CHTA mutants lacking the activation domain while retaining downstream sequences ( 49-51 ) .
Mutants M4 , A7 and A8 are in regions of CIITA that to our knowledge have not been studied ; these mutants therefore suggest a functional role for these regions of the molecule .
Analysis of the L1 and L2 mutants indicates that these regions are required for CIITA function LCD motifs have been shown to facilitate interactions between many proteins , including nuclear receptors and their coactivators ( 52 ) , as well as transcription factors and coactivators ( 53 ) .
These motifs are characterized by the consensus LxxLL , where there is a loose consensus for charged amino acids at both x positions .
Analysis of CIITA revealed four such sequences .
Of these , three are conserved between human and murine CITA ( 47 ) .
The A5 deletion removed two potential motifs that could be responsible for its dependence on the presence of the W box for function .

Transient transfections were performed introducing 20 ug pDRW-X-Y , 40 ug CIITA mutant expression plasmids and 1 ug SV » -Alkphos into CHTA* Raji cells as described for Figure 3 .
Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and assayed for CAT levels as described above .
Reporter activity is expressed as a percentage of each mutant compared with CAT levels in transfections receiving the control expression vector ( percent baseline CAT ) .

the G3 region of the putative GTP-binding domain and the first LCD motif ( L1 ) were deleted in this mutant .
To determine if the W box dependence of ASCIITA is attributable to loss of the L1 motif , a mutational analysis of L1 and L2 was undertaken .
Previous studies indicate that protein-protein interactions directed by LCD motifs can be mediated by multiple LCDs grouped together in proteins ( 53 ) .
For this reason , mutants were created that disrupted both L1 and L2 , which are separated by 56 residues in the primary amino acid sequence .
To create more subtle changes , alanine residues were substituted for the conserved leucines in the first two LCD motifs ( CIHITA-mutLl and A. pa pel- y Nucleic Acids Research , 1998 , Vol .

A double mutant consisting of the L2 mutation and the ASCIITA deletion ( ASCIITA-mutL2 ) was also created .
These mutants were analyzed by in vitro transcription/ translation and immunoblot procedures as for the deletion mutants .
The expression of each mutant was similar to those described above ( Fig .
2C ) .
When transient transfections into RJ2.2.5 cells were performed in conjunction with both the pDRG-XI1-X2-Y ( Fig .
5A ) and pDRW-X-Y ( Fig .
5B ) reporter constructs , it was found that neither CHTA-mutL1 nor the double mutant ( ASCHITA-mutL2 ) were able to drive transcription from either promoter .
CHITA-mutL2 displayed activity similar to A5 : ~50 % activity in the presence of the W box and < 20 % activity when just the X-Y region was used .
When transfected into Raji cells , the double mutant was able to reduce reporter levels to 68.5 % of baseline ( Fig .
6 ) .
DISCUSSION While recent studies using the yeast two-hybrid approach have suggested very weak interactions between CIITA and a subunit of RFX , RFX5 ( 54 ) , direct physical interactions between CITA and the class II-specific transcription factors have not been described .
Thus , if the activation domain of CIITA is responsible for driving expression , how does CIITA interact with the class II promoter ?
To elucidate further the mechanism of CHTA action , mutations were created and assayed for their ability to drive transcription or to interfere with the function of wild-type CIITA in transient co-transfection assays .
While many of the mutants were inactive , two mutants displayed the ability to distinguish between class II promoter elements .
These two mutants required the W box as well as the X box for function .
These mutants suggest that in addition to the X box factors , CIITA normally interacts with W box factors .
This finding is unique in that these are the first examples of mutations in CIITA that sensitize it to the presence of a promoter element .

Analysis of LCD mutants in CIITA* Raji cells .
Transient transfection and analysis were performed in Raji cells as described for Figure 4 , using 40 ug indicated mutant CIITA constructs .
The data represent averages from three independent assays , with SEM indicated .
( 27,39 ) , this result strongly supports a role for CIITA at the promoter as a frans-activator .
The W box of class II promoters is the least homologous of the conserved sequences .
It was first defined by its requirement for IFN-y induction of class II expression ( 4,15 ) and enhancement of class II expression in B cells ( 14,16 ) .
Subregions within the W box have been identified , termed the S or Z box , that provide some of the effect of the full W box region .
Portions of the S region of the DRA gene are similar to the X1 box , where RFX normally binds .
Recently , Jabrane-Ferrat et al .
( 55 ) found that the S region could bind RFX in vitro , although weakly .
This interaction was stabilized by interactions with the Y box factor NF-Y .
These results suggested that RFX may bind to both the S and the X1 boxes of class II genes .
The isolation of mutant CHTA constructs ( ASCIITA and CIITA-mutL2 ) that require the W box in addition to the X- Y boxes for activity suggests that CIITA does 4134 Nucleic Acids Research , 1998 , Vol .

Model for transactivation of MHC class II transcription by CIITA .
Interactions between CIITA and promoter-bound factors at the W , X1 , X2 and Y boxes serve to stabilize the W-X-Y complex and lead to transcriptional transactivation of MHC class II genes .
Our data adds to the current model of MHC class II transcriptional regulation by implicating direct interactions between CIITA and the W box , providing one possible explanation for W box involvement in induction of class II transcription by IFN-y .
indeed interact with this region ( Fig .
7 ) .
These mutations are not likely to be in the region of CIITA that interacts with W box factors .
Alternatively , these mutations define a region of CITA that interacts with other factors ; the loss of these interactions causes the protein to retain frans-activation capability only in the presence of 'stabilizing ' interactions with factors at the W box .
The above finding suggests that in B cells , the W box may function to stabilize CIITA interactions , allowing optimal transcriptional activation ( Fig .
7 ) , thus offering a molecular explanation for the requirement for the W box for class II induction by IFN-y .
In the case of IFN-y induction in class II negative cells , such as human fibroblasts , a similar situation likely exists with one modification , i.e .
the steady-state level of RFX .
The level of RFX5 , a subunit of RFX , in human fibroblasts is > 20-fold lower than that in B cells ( 20 ) , suggesting that RFX may be limiting in fibroblasts .
The W/S box could provide an additional binding site for RFX , allowing for more efficient assembly of factors to class II promoters .
Moreover , the induction of CITA by IFN-y may further increase the stability of W-X-Y complexes .
This model is supported by two lines of evidence .
First , while the half-life of an RFX-X2BP-NF-Y-DNA complex is > 4 h in vitro , these assays were carried out under conditions where the factors were not limiting ( 56 ) .
As RFX concentration is reduced , the ability to form such in vitro complexes is also reduced , suggesting that if one of the factors were limiting in vivo , then the assembly time of the complex may be increased or the half-life reduced .
For example , the half-life of RFX for X1 box DNA and X2BP for X2 box DNA in vitro is ~2 and 5 min , respectively ( 28,29,57 ) .
Second , in vivo genomic footprinting ( IVGF ) of the W-X-Y region in fibroblasts detected only partially protected sequences , which became fully protected upon IFN-y treatment ( 58-60 ) .
Partial occupancy on IVGF indicates that fewer cells in the population have the region occupied at any one time .
Thus , it is possible that induction of CIITA by IFN-y in fibroblasts could stabilize the complex , providing an enhanced footprint .
How much CHITA is required to activate transcription of class II genes ?
At least nine genes are activated in most cells when CIITA is expressed : DRA/B , DQA/B , DPA/B , DMA/B and Ii .
The B cell line Raji expresses high levels of MHC class II and easily detectable levels of CIITA .
Yet , even in Raji cells , overexpression of CHITA from a plasmid results in a 4-fold increase in expression of class II promoters , demonstrating that CIITA is limiting .
Similar experiments by others have not shown CIITA to be limiting in Raji cells ( 61 ) .
The level of CIHITA by immunoblot analysis in IFN-y treated fibroblasts is barely detectable using our current antiserum and may be 10-20 times lower than in Raji cells ( data not shown ) , suggesting that small amounts of CIITA are sufficient to induce class II expression .
The fact that CITA is limiting may support a model in which CIITA transiently associates with the W-X-Y box factors and highlights the importance of CITA forming multiple interactions with DNA-bound factors at W-X-Y .
The identification of mutants that functionally interfere with wild-type CIITA molecules highlights regions of importance in the CIITA molecule .
While the most straightforward examples of dominant negative mutants have been those that compete with wild-type proteins for homodimer formation ( 62 ) , there are other explanations for dominant negative mutants that do not require the protein to act as a homodimer , such as deletion of an activation domain from a transactivator .
Such a construct would retain all other interactions , yet lose its ability to recruit the general transcriptional machinery to the promoter .
Indeed , this type of dominant negative mutant has been described for other coactivators , such as c-Ets2 ( 63 ) and NTF-1 ( 64 ) .
CHTA ( 161-1130 ) fits this category of dominant negative mutants .
The sequence of CHTA between residues 420 and 561 shows homology to the G1 , G3 and G4 domains of a GTP-binding motif ( reviewed in 65 ) .
The A3CIITA allele has a specific deletion in the G1 domain ( 66 ) , which is involved in phosphate binding , suggesting the intriguing possibility that CIITA requires GTP for function .
Chin et al .
( 42 ) recently showed that mutation of the region corresponding to the G3 motif results in a non-functional , dominant negative CITA molecule ( 42 ) .
Attempts to show GTP and other nucleotide binding by CIITA were inconclusive ( data not shown ) .
It is possible that CIITA binds GTP with low affinity or that other factors are required for this binding that may not be present in vitro .
Alternatively , the GTP-binding motif homology may be coincidental and the deletion in A3CIITA eliminates numerous glycine residues , which may provide needed flexibility at this position .
Comparison of the function of some mutants described underscores the fact that little is known about the three-dimensional structure of CHITA and hence the effect of these mutations on the protein .
A5 and mutL1 both disrupt the L1 motif , the former with a 10 residue deletion , the latter with alanine substitutions at three conserved leucines .
The result that the alanine substitution mutant resulted in a more severe phenotype than the deletion is intriguing and could result from unproductive protein folding in the presence of alanine residues at the position of L1 ( amino acid residues 465-469 ) .
Because leucine residues have a tendency to be near the N-terminal ends of o-helical structures ( 67 ) , it is possible that loss of these stabilizing residues results in 'dead end ' protein folding and therefore a more severe phenotype of mutL1 as compared with ASCIHITA .
Most of the recently described CIITA mutations result in non-functional proteins , however , a small number produced a dominant negative effect ( 42,50 ) .
Summarizing the effects of individual CIHTA mutations a new understanding emerges ( Fig .
8 ) .
A clear requirement for the acidic regions , the P/S/T region and the C-terminal regions becomes apparent .
However , there appears to be strict boundaries between regions of the molecule Functional aa # : 1_TAF132° 250 500 Nucleic Acids Research , 1998 , Vol .

that can be mutated while still retaining enough function to act in a dominant negative manner , both at the N- and C-termini of CHTA .
Comparison of mutants surrounding the putative GTP-binding domain is interesting in that mutations within this region are capable of yielding non-functional , dominant negative and functional CIITA molecules .
Indeed , similar mutants have been shown to have discordant results in transactivation assays : ASCIITA exhibits the ability to transactivate in a W box-dependent manner , while a smaller deletion of solely the G3 residues [ CHTA-GTP2 ( ADAYG ) ; 42 ] has no activity and has been shown to have a dominant negative effect .
A majority of mutants that disrupt regions conserved between human and murine CHITA result in non-functional or dominant negative phenotypes , indicating that the structure of CIITA is highly conserved between species .
It is interesting that the P/S/T domain is not conserved , yet this region is required for function of the human gene ; an analysis of the role of non-conserved regions of the murine protein may lead to insights into the role of the P/S/T domain in the function of CHITA .
