Involvement of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase in NFAT Activation in T Cells* ( Received for publication , January 28 , 1997 ) Thomas Jascur , Jennifer Gilman , and Tomas Mustelint From the Division of Cell Biology , La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology , San Diego , California 92121 Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation in many cell types .
We have previously shown that in T cells the PI3-K inhibitor , wortmannin , interferes with activation of the mitogen-activated kinase , Erk2 , after T cell receptor ( TeR ) stimulation .
To further explore the involvement of in T cell activation , we created a set of potentially dominant negative PI3-K constructs comprising individual or tandem domains of the regulatory p85 subunit and tested their effect on downstream signaling events like Erk2 activation and transcription from an NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) element taken from the interleukin-2 promoter .
Following TcR stimulation , activation of Erk2 was only inhibited by a previously described truncated form of p85 that can not bind the catalytic subunit , but not by other constructs of p85 .
In contrast , several mutant p85 alleles had dramatic effects on NFAT activation .
Most interest-ingly , the N-terminal SH2 domain had an inhibitory ef-fect , whereas a mutant p85 containing only the two SH2 domains enhanced basal NFAT activity in a Ras-depend-ent manner .
Ionomycin induced synergistic activation of NFAT in cells expressing p85 mutants that contained the C-terminal SH2 domain .
Analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins bound to truncated p85 constructs revealed cooperative binding of the two SH2 domains but no apparent differences between the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains .
Wortmannin did not interfere with NFAT activation , although it inhibited PI3-K and Erk2 activation in the same experiment .
These results suggest that PI3-K is involved in NFAT activation through a complex adaptor function of its regulatory subunit and that its lipid kinase activity is dispensable for this effect .
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI8-K ) ' has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth in a variety of cell types including T lymphocytes ( 1 ) .

These lipids are not subject to breakdown by phospholipase C but seem to activate Ser/Thr-specific protein kinases such as some isoforms of protein kinase C ( 3-5 ) , and protein kinase B , also known as c-Akt ( 6 , 7 ) .
The isoform of PIS-K that becomes activated in response to growth factor receptor stimulation is a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit ( p85 « or p85 $ B ) ( 8-10 ) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit ( p110a or ( 11 ) .
The p85 subunit contains a number of domains that mediate protein-protein interactions and are commonly found in signaling proteins : one Sre homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain , two proline-rich regions , two SH2 domains , and a region with similarity to the breakpoint cluster region gene ( BCR homology region ) .
Binding of the catalytic p110 subunit occurs through interaction of the region between the SH2 domains of p85 ( inter-SH2 domain or iSH2 ) and the extreme N terminus of the catalytic subunit ( 12 , 13 ) .
Regulation of PI3-K activity occurs through interaction of the two subunits ( 14 , 15 ) , autophosphorylation at Ser-608 ( 16 ) , and membrane localization ( 17 ) .
In addition , a number of reports have demonstrated that binding of cellular proteins to PI3-K domains can increase its enzymatic activity : the SH3 domain of Sre family kinases binding to one or both of the proline-rich regions of p85 ( 18 ) , phosphotyrosine-containing peptides binding to the SH2 domains of p85 ( 19 , 20 ) , and GTP-Ras binding to the catalytic pl110 subunit ( 21 ) .
However , the in vivo function of these and the other PI3-K domains , and their contribution to various signaling processes of PI3-K , are poorly understood .
We have previously shown that TceR-induced activation of the mitogen-activated kinase , Erk2 , requires PI3-K activity since the PI3-K inhibitor , wortmannin , blocked Erk2 activation ( 22 ) .
Furthermore , a mutated form of p85 that lacked the p110-binding iSH2 region ( p85A1iSH2 ) reduced Erk2 activation , presumably by occupying PI3-K binding sites on other cellular proteins .
To study this in more detail and to shed some light on the physiological role of the various domains , we have generated a set of truncated p85 mutants to study the role of PI3-K. domains in T cell activation .
As a functional readout we used a reporter gene driven by the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , which is a transcription factor complex that plays a key role in the induction of the interleukin-2 gene and other lymphokine genes during T cell activation ( 23 ) .
It consists of two components : preexisting cytosolic NFATp , which translocates into the nucleus in response to a calcium signal , and a nuclear component , AP-1 , which consists of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins and is induced by a cascade of mitogen-activated protein kinase-related protein kinases and as a result of protein kinase C activation .
NFAT-driven expression of reporter genes has been widely used as a physiologically relevant assay to study signal trans-duction events that lead to cytokine expression in T cells .
Here we report that PI3-K has different effects on Erk2 and downstream 14483 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog 14484 NFAT activation .
Erk2 activation in response to TcR engagement was sensitive to wortmannin , and only inhibited by over-expressing p85AiSH2 , but not individual p85 domains .
NFAT activation , on the other hand , was not sensitive to wortmannin , but was inhibited by the SH3 domain , the N-terminal SH2 domain , and a p85 fragment comprising the two proline-rich regions and the BCR homology domain .
In contrast , three constructs that contain the C-terminal SH2 domain caused an elevated basal level of NFAT activity , which was synergisti-cally increased by ionomycin .
Both the increased basal NFAT level and the activation following TcR stimulation depended on functional Ras and calcineurin .
These studies provide evidence that PI3-K is involved in cytokine induction in a way that does not involve enzymatic activity but a previously unrecognized adaptor function of the regulatory subunit .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies and Reagents-The anti-CD8e mAb , OKT83 , was purified from ascites fluid by protein A-Sepharose chromatography .

PI3-K Constructs-The p85AiSH2 and iSH2 constructs have been described previously ( 22 ) .
p85 fragments encoding the amino acids indicated in Fig .
1A were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers tailed with Xbal and EcoRI ( SH3 , PBP , N-SH2 ) , EcoRI and Ndel ( C-SH2 ) , or Xbal and Ndel ( NC , NiC , full-length p85 ) sites .
p85AiSH2 was used as a template for NC ; wild-type bovine p85 « was used as a template for the other constructs .
The N-terminal fragment of pl10 ( amino acids 1-171 ) was amplified using bovine p110a as a template and primers tailed with NReI and Ndel sites .
The fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the vector pEF-HA ( 22 ) .
The resulting fusion proteins express an influenza hemagglutinin epitope YPYDVPDYA at their N terminus .
All constructs prepared for this study were verified by sequencing .
Cells and Transient Transfections-Jurkat cells stably expressing the simian virus large T antigen ( J-TAg ) were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , glutamine , antibiotics , and 0.5 mg/ml G418 .
Transient transfec-tions were carried out by electroporation as described before ( 22 ) .
Typically , a total amount of DNA of 17-20 ug was added to 20 X 10° cells ( 5 ug of c-Imyc-tagged Erk2 plus 15 ug of PIS-K construct or empty vector , or 2 ug of NFAT-lue plus 15 ug of PIS-K construct or empty vector ) .
Immunoprecipitations and in Vitro Kinase Assays-These were performed essentially as described previously ( 22 ) .
Luciferase Assays-Two days after transient transfection , J-TAg cells were stimulated with 10 ug/ml OKT3 , 50 ng/ml PMA , or 1 ug/ml ionomycin , or left untreated for 3-4 h in 24-well plates in a tissue culture incubator .
The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 ul of lysis buffer ( 100 mM KPO , , pH 7.8 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.2 % Triton X-100 ) .
Lysates were clarified by centrifuga-tion at 15,000 X g for 5 min , and 50 ul were used for luciferase assays in an automated luminometer ( Monolight 2010 , Analytical Luminescence Laboratory , Ann Arbor , MI ) .
The final assay contained 50 pl of lysate plus 100 pl of ATP solution ( 10 mM ATP , 85 mM glyeyl-glycine , pH 7.8 , 20 mm MgCl , ) plus 100 pl of luciferin reagent ( 0.27 mM coen-zyme A , 0.47 mM luciferin , 85 mM glycyl-glycine , pH 7.8 , 20 mm MgCl , , ) .
The protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined by the Bradford protein assay and used to normalize the luciferase activity .
Typically , the variation in protein concentration between samples was smaller than 20 % .
RESULTS Effect of PI3-K Constructs on Erk2 Activation-Among the signaling components thought to be downstream of the TcR and PI3-K is the mitogen-activated protein kinase , Erk2 ( 24 ) .

A , schematic representation of recombinant p85 PI3-K constructs used in this study .
B , J-TAg cells were transiently transfected with 20 ug of the indicated p85 mutants or empty vector .
After 2 days in culture , the cells were either stimulated with OKT3 or mock-treated , and the recombinant p85 constructs were immunoprecipitated from Nonidet P-40 lysates with an anti-HA antibody .
Recombinant proteins were revealed by an anti-HA Western blot .
and a mutated form of p85 that can not bind the catalytic subunit ( p85AiSH2 ) inhibited Erk2 activation in T cells ( 22 ) .
To further investigate the role of p85 domains in Erk2 activation and other processes relevant to T cell activation we generated a set of truncated p85 constructs ( Fig .
14 ) .
Transient expression of these constructs in J-TAg cells yielded anti-HA reactive proteins of the expected sizes ( Fig .
1B ) .
We tested these constructs for an effect on Erk2 activation by co-expressing them with c-Myc-tagged Erk2 in J-TAg cells .
48 h after transfection , the cells were either stimulated for 3 min with the anti-CD3 antibody , OKT3 , or left untreated .
c-Myc-tagged Erk2 was immunoprecipitated using the mAb 9E10 , and in vitro kinase assays were performed using MBP as a substrate .
As can be seen in the upper panel of Fig .
2 , only p85AiSH2 clearly inhibited Erk2 activation , presumably because it binds to PI3-K-activating proteins or sites but fails to transduce a signal to the catalytic p110 subunit of PI3-K. All other constructs had negligible effects on Erk2 activation , although they were efficiently expressed ( data not shown ) .
The SH3 domain and PBP seemed to increase Erk2 activation , but an anti-Erk2 blot on the same 9E10 immunoprecipitates ( Fig .
2 , lower panel ) showed that these two samples contained slightly more Erk2 protein .
Thus , it seems that multiple domains of endogenous p85 need to be competed away by transfected constructs to inhibit this pathway .
610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog PI3-K in NFAT Activation Complex Role of PI3-K Domains in NFAT Activation-To further characterize the role of PI3-K in T cell activation we studied the effect of truncated p85 and p110 constructs on the activation of the transcription factor NFAT .
J-TAg cells were co-transfected with NFAT-lue and PI3-K constructs and stimulated with OKT3 for 3-4 h. Luciferase activity was assayed in the cell lysates as a reporter for NFAT activation .
Fig .
3A shows that PI3-K constructs had complex effects on NFAT activity following TcR/CD3 stimulation .
The SH3 domain , a fragment containing two proline-rich regions and the BCR homology domain ( PBP ) , the N-terminal SH2 domain ( N-SH2 ) , and the inter-SH2 domain ( iSH2 ) all inhibited NFAT activation , whereas the C-terminal SH2 domain ( C-SH2 ) increased the basal NFAT activity without affecting the level of NFAT activity after TcR/CD3 stimulation .
The C-SH2 domain seemed to have a dominant effect over the N-SH2 domain since constructs containing both SH2 domains ( p85NC and p85NiC ) behaved more like C-SH2 than like N-SHZ .
p85AiSH2 and full-length p85 both lead to elevated basal levels of NFAT activity with almost no further stimulation after TcR engage-ment .
The N-terminal fragment of p110 that binds p85 ( p110 NT ) did not substantially affect NFAT activation , but it was expressed at a lower level than the p85 constructs .
This experiment was repeated three times with different batches of DNA & '' P & 4 Po 5 I ¢ € '' .

Activation of NFAT requires two signals , one involving calcium ( inducible by ionomycin ) , and one involving Ras ( inducible by PMA , ; reviewed in Ref .
25 ) .
To test whether the mutated PI3-K constructs used in this study acted in the calcium pathway or in the Ras pathway , we tested their effect on NFAT activation in cells that had been stimulated with either PMA or ionomycin ( Fig .
3B ) .
PMA alone did not activate NFAT , and none of the p85 mutants had a synergistic effect on NFAT in the presence of PMA .
Ionomycin , on the other hand , synergis-tically activated NFAT in cells that were transfected with p85 constructs containing the C-terminal SH2 domain .
We conclude that these `` activating '' mutants mimicked or induced a process in the Ras/PKC pathway , which together with an increase in intracellular calcium lead to a strong activation of NFAT .
Cyclosporin A Inhibits TcR-induced and p8S5NC-induced NFAT Activation-Calcineurin is a cytosolic Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFATp in a calci-um/calmodulin-dependent way , a critical step for nuclear translocation of NFATp and assembly of functional NFAT com-plexes .
To ask if calcineurin is involved in NFAT activation by p85NC , we took advantage of the immunosuppressant , cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , a potent inhibitor of calcineurin ( 26 , 27 ) .
Fig .
4 shows that CsA efficiently inhibited NFAT activation after stimulation with either OKT3 or ionomycin .
In cells transfected with inhibitory p85 constructs ( SH8 , PBP , and N-SH2 ) , CsA inhibited NFAT even further .
Because the inhibition of NFAT that is caused by these p85 constructs seems to have an additional effect to the inhibition mediated by CsA , we speculate that also these p85 constructs act in the Ras/PKC pathway .
In the presence of the activating construct , p85NC , inhibition by CsA was substantial , but not complete .
This is compatible with pS5NC stimulating the Ras/PKC-dependent pathway .
Dominant Negative Ras Blocks NFAT Activation by pSSNC-The Ras GTPase has been implicated in PI3-K signaling ( 28 ) and has been demonstrated to bind directly to the catalytic subunit of PI3-K ( 21 ) .
To address whether the increase in basal NFAT activity in cells expressing p8SSNC requires functional Ras , we co-transfected cells with NFAT-luc , p85SNC , and increasing amounts of dominant negative Ras ( RasN17 ) .
Both the basal NFAT activity in unstimulated cells , as well as the TcR-induced activation , were inhibited by RasN17 in a dose-de-pendent manner ( Fig .

It is important to note that the ex B Fic .

Involvement of PI3-K in NFAT activation .
J-TAg cells were transiently transfected with either empty vector ( 17 ug ) or NFAT-luc ( 2 pg ) plus empty vector ( 15 ug ) or NFAT-lue ( 2 ug ) plus recombinant PI8-K constructs ( 15 ug ) .
Two days later , the cells were either mock-treated , or stimulated with OKT3 , PMA , ionomycin , or PMA plus ionomycin for 3 h , and cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity and for protein concentration .
Luminescence units were corrected for protein concentration in the ly-sates , and the data are presented as percent of maximal activation , as determined by activation by PMA plus ionomycin .

NFAT activation requires calcineurin .
J-TAg cells were transiently transfected with NFAT-lue ( 2 pg ) plus empty vector or recombinant p85 constructs ( 15 ug ) .
Two days later the cells were pretreated with 100 nM cyclosporin A or mock-treated for 15 min , followed by stimulation with control medium or OKT3 or ionomycin for 3 h. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity and protein concentration .
The data are presented as arbitrary luminescence units corrected for protein concentration , and the lower panel represents a magnified view of the lower part of the upper panel ( note the scale ) .
pression level of p85NC was not affected by RasN17 .
Therefore , RasN17-mediated abrogation of p85NC-induced basal NFAT activity can not be explained by loss of p8SNC expression .
Wortmannin Does Not Inhibit NFAT Activation-To understand the complex effects on NFAT activation of the mutant p85 constructs used in this study , we sought to correlate them with the catalytic activity of endogenous PI3-K in the transfected cells .
We therefore decided to ask first whether PI3-K catalytic activity is required for NFAT activation .
Wortmannin has been widely used to irreversibly inhibit PI3-K and to demonstrate the involvement of PI3-K in many cellular processes ( 29 ) .
We transiently transfected cells with NFAT-lue ( plus empty vector ) .
Two days after transfection , the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of wortmannin for 30 min and then stimulated with OKT3 for 3 h. To verify inhibition of PI3-K by wortmannin , samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the OKT3-stimulation ( after 3 min and 3 h , respectively ) and from unstimulated control cells and assayed for PI3-K activity in p85 immunoprecipitates .
Activation of Erk2 was tested by immunoblotting of total cell lysates of the same samples with an anti-phospho-Erk2 antibody .
After 3 h of stimulation with OKT3 , cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity .
The upper panel of Fig .
6 shows that increasing concentrations of wortmannin progressively inhibited PI3-K activity , and that this inhibition lasted for the entire duration of the stimulation with OKT3 .
This is impor-tant , because wortmannin is known to be unstable , and de novo synthesis of PI3-K might partially reverse the effect of wortmannin once it is hydrolyzed .
Erk2 activation was observed after 3 min of stimulation and was sensitive to wortmannin as shown before ( 22 ) ( Fig .
6 , middle ) .
No Erk2 activation was observed after 3 h of stimulation with OKT3 ( data not shown ) .
Surprisingly , wortmannin did not inhibit NFAT activation ( Fig .
6 , lower panel ) .
At the highest wortmannin concentration , we tested to achieve complete inhibition of PI3-K , NFAT activation was even higher than in untreated cells , but this may be due to lack of specificity of wortmannin at this concentration .

NFAT activation by pS5SNC requires functional Ras .
J-TAg cells were transiently transfected with NFAT-luc ( 2 ug ) plus the indicated constructs and empty vector to give a total amount of DNA of 20 ug for each transfection .
After 2 days , the cells were stimulated either with control medium or with OKT3 or with PMA plus ionomycin for 3 h , and cell lysates were assayed for luciferase ( fop panel ) .
Lysate samples were subjected to an anti-HA Western blot to control for NC expression levels ( bottom panels ) .
The three lanes shown for each transfection are from cells that were either untreated or stimulated with OKT3 or with PMA plus ionomycin .
We therefore conclude that the kinase activity of PI3-K is not required for NFAT activation or may even have an inhibitory effect .
Cellular Protein Binding to PI3K Domains-The effect of p85 domains on NFAT is likely to be mediated by cellular proteins that bind to them .
To learn more about the role of PI3-K domains in NFAT activation , we transiently expressed the constructs described above in J-TAg cells and immunoprecipitated them with an anti-HA antibody from resting and from OKT3-stimulated cells .
Bound phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were revealed by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting ( Fig .
7 ) .
While the SH3 domain and the PBP fragment did not associate with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins , all constructs that contained one or two SH2 domains coprecipi-tated with a similar set of proteins .
A tandem arrangement of the two SH2 domains seemed to be essential for efficient binding to cellular phosphotyrosine-containing proteins , especially for the ~21-kDa protein , which we identified as the TeR £ chain ( data not shown ) .
However , there was no major difference in the pattern of proteins bound to either the N-SH2 domain or the C-SH2 domain .
The functional difference of the two SH2 domain constructs with regard to NFAT stimulation can therefore not readily be explained by different binding characteristics of the SH2 domains .
DISCUSSION In this study , we overexpressed potentially dominant negative mutants to investigate the role of heterodimeric p85/p110 PI3-K in the activation of the mitogen-activated kinase , Erk2 , and the transcription factor , NFAT .
We found that PI3-K was involved in both processes , but in fundamentally different ways .
Erk2 activation was inhibited by wortmannin and by a mutated p85 that can not bind to the catalytic p110 subunit , but overexpression of other p85 constructs had no effect .
Activation of NFAT , on the other hand , was insensitive to wortmannin , but was affected by overexpression of truncated forms of p85 in 610Z '01 Aepy uo 4g /810-0q [ 'mmmy/ : dyy wo ; popeoumog PI3-K in NFAT Activation Fic .

PI3S-K activity is not required for NFAT activation .
J-TAg cells were transfected with 2 ug NFAT-lue plus 15 ug of empty vector .
After 2 days , the cells were washed four times with serum-free medium , and treated with the indicated concentrations of wortmannin for 30 min at 87°C .
Cells were then stimulated with OKT3 or control me-dium .
After 3 min and again after 3 h of stimulation , samples were taken and the endogenous PIS8-K was immunoprecipitated from lysates and subjected to in vitro lipid kinase assays using phosphatidylinositol and [ y-* '' P ] ATP as substrates to verify inhibition of PI3-K by wortmannin ( fop ) .
Activation of Erk2 was tested by Western blotting with an anti-phospho-Erk2 antibody on cell lysates from the 3-min time point ( left bottom panel ) , and NFAT activation measured by luciferase assays from the 3-h points ( right bottom panel ) .

To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report that describes a role of PI3-K in NFAT activation .
Since catalytic activity does not seem to be involved , we speculate that p85 may have an adaptor function that is crucial for NFAT activation .
This adaptor function would not only recruit p110 to the membrane but also bring other signaling proteins together , which then activate NFAT .
The used p85 constructs fall into two classes : ( i ) those that inhibit TeR/CD3-mediated NFAT activation ( SH3 , PBP , N-SH2 , and iSH2 ) and ( ii ) those that increase NFAT activity in resting cells and synergize with ionomycin ( C-SH2 , NC , NiC , p85AiSH2 , wild-type p85 ) .
Most striking is perhaps that the two SH2 domains had opposite effects on NFAT activation although their sequence specificity for phosphoprotein binding is similar ( Y*XXM ) ( 30 ) , and although they bound a comparable pattern of cellular phosphotyrosine-containing proteins .
It is interesting to note that in a study using microinjected antibodies against either SH2 domain of p85 , anti-N-SH2 antibodies had a different effect than anti-C-SH2 antibodies ( 31 ) .
We have attempted to identify proteins that bind to the p85 mutants used here in a way that would explain their role in NFAT activation , but Western blotting using antibodies against c-Cbl ( 32 , 33 ) , Grb2 ( 34 ) , Rac ( 35 ) , Cded42Hs , SLP-76 ( 36 , 37 ) , PLCy1 , and the TcR { chain ( 388 , 39 ) failed to show any differences .
It is unlikely that p85 acts through Cbl , because a transforming Cbl mutant that constitutively activated NFAT ( 70/23 ) still did so even after its binding to PI3-K was disrupted by a point mutation ( 40 ) .

Ras can bind p110 in a GTP-dependent manner , and transfection of Ras resulted in an elevation of 3-phosphoinositides , whereas dominant negative RasN17 inhibited production of 3-phosphoinositides ( 21 ) .
Together with the finding that GTP-Ras could activate PI3-K ( 41 ) , this argues for a role of Ras upstream of PI3-K. On the other hand , constitutively active PI3-K increased the amount of GTP-bound Ras and activated the c-fos promoter , and coexpression of dominant negative Ras blocked c-fos activation ( 42 ) .
Ras is also playing a major role in TcR-induced NFAT activation ( 43 , 44 ) .
We were wondering if functional Ras was required for the p85SNC-medi-ated increase in NFAT activity , and cotransfection of RasN17 showed that this was indeed the case .
This would place Ras downstream of PI3-K in T cells , but does not exclude a role also upstream of PI3-K .
Although we presently do not know the molecular mechanism by which p85 activates NFAT , we found that several p85 constructs acted on NFAT activation via the Ras/PKC pathway .
Activation of NFAT depends on two signals ; calcium/cal-cineurin is required for nuclear translocation of NFATp , and Ras/PKC is required for induction of AP-1 .
Those p85 alleles that increased the basal NFAT level also synergized with ionomycin ( but not with PMA ) , which suggests that they mimicked a process in the Ras/PKC pathway to cooperate with calcium/ calcineurin .
And while cyclosporin A effectively inhibited NFAT activation , coexpression of inhibitory p85 constructs caused an additional decrease in NFAT activity , most likely by interfering with the Ras/PKC pathway .
Finally , the finding that RasN17 blocked p85NC-induced NFAT activation provides additional evidence for a function of p85 in the Ras pathway .
Taken together , our results indicate that p85 with its multiple domains plays an important and complex role in TcR-induced gene activation .
