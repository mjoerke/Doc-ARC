Yankee , * Jianjie Hu , * David J. Asai , '' Marietta L. Harrison , * and Robert L. Geahlen** The cross-linking of the B cell Ag receptor ( BCR ) is coupled to the stimulation of multiple intracellular signal transduction cascades via receptor-associated , protein tyrosine kinases of both the Src and Syk families .
To monitor changes in the subcellular distribution of Syk in B cells responding to BCR cross-linking , we expressed in Syk-deficient DT40 B cells a fusion protein consisting of Syk coupled to green fluorescent protein .
Treatment of these cells with anti-IgM Abs leads to the recruitment of the kinase from cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments to the site of the cross-linked receptor at the plasma membrane .
The Syk-receptor complexes aggregate into membrane patches that redistribute to form a cap at one pole of the cell .
Syk is not demonstrably associated with the internalized receptor .
Catalytically active Syk promotes and stabilizes the formation of tightly capped BCR complexes at the plasma membrane .
Lyn is not required for the recruitment of Syk to the cross-linked receptor , but is required for the internalization of the clustered BCR complexes .
In the absence of Lyn , receptor-Syk complexes at the plasma membrane are long lived , and the receptor-mediated activation of the NF-AT transcription factor is enhanced .
Thus , Lyn appears to function to negatively regulate aspects of BCR-dependent signaling by stimulating receptor internalization and down-regulation .

B cell lines lacking the syk gene are largely nonresponsive to BCR aggregation ( 1 ) .
Likewise , B cell development in Syk-deficient mice is blocked at the pro-B cell to pre-B cell and the immature B cell to mature B cell transitions due to a loss of Ag receptor-dependent signals ( 2 , 3 ) .
The participation of Syk in BCR-mediated signaling begins with its physical recruitment to the cross-linked receptor .
The Ag-binding component of the BCR is a membrane-bound Ig , and the signal-transducing component is a heterodimer of Ig- « ( CD79a ) and Ig-B ( CD79b ) subunits ( 4 , 5 ) .
The Syk-receptor interaction is initiated by the phosphorylation of conserved tyrosines present within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs ( ITAMs ) located within the cytoplasmic domains of Ig-a « and Ig-B ( 6 , 7 ) .
This ITAM phosphorylation creates docking sites for the tandem pair of Syk SH2 domains .
Binding to the phosphorylated ITAM and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation leads to the activation of Syk .
Syk then couples the BCR to multiple downstream signaling pathways that are stimulated following T he Syk protein-tyrosine kinase is required for the trans- Departments of *Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and Biological Sciences , Purdue University , West Lafayette , IN 47907 Received for publication May 4 , 2000 .

A Sre family kinase such as Lyn , which is expressed predominately in hemopoietic cells , is required for the efficient activation of Syk following BCR aggregation .
It probably plays two important roles in this regard : the phosphorylation of ITAM tyrosines and the phosphorylation of Syk itself on tyrosines located within the activation loop .
This general model for the early events in BCR-mediated signaling is analogous to that proposed for signaling through the TCR and its associated kinases , Lck and ZAP-70 ( 11 , 12 ) .
In T cells , Lek is needed for both receptor-ITAM phosphorylation and ZAP-70 phosphorylation and activation .
However , several studies have found fundamental differences between ZAP-70 and Syk and their reliance on Sre family kinases for activation .
For example , Syk , but not ZAP-70 , can restore TCR-stimulated signaling to Jurkat T cells deficient in Lok ( 13 , 14 ) .
Also , recent genetic studies have shown that , in many contexts , the expression of Lyn has a negative effect on signaling in B cells .
For example , certain BCR-stimulated events such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and activation of the serine/threonine ki-nase , Akt/protein kinase B , are actually more robust in DT4O0 B cells that lack Lyn , the only Src family kinase expressed in these cells at a detectable level ( 1 , 15 ) .
Likewise , IgM cross-linking in primary B cells from Lyn knockout mice leads to hyperactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun kinase pathways and a hyperproliferative response ( 16-18 ) .
The recruitment of Syk to the aggregated BCR has not been visualized in intact cells , and the biochemical demonstration of this is difficult due to the association of the aggregated receptor with cytoskeletal components , which hampers the isolation of intact BCR-Syk complexes in high yield .
To approach this problem , we generated cDNAs coding for a chimeric molecule of Syk fused with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) .
We then used this construct 0022-1767/01/ $ 02.00 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG 1508 as a tool for visualizing the effects of BCR cross-linking on the redistribution of Syk within cells that either express or do not express endogenous Lyn .
In this study we demonstrate that Syk is present in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and is recruited from both to the site of the aggregated BCR .
Syk is associated with receptors aggregated to form both membrane patches and polar caps .
The recruitment of Syk to the BCR is most efficient when Syk retains catalytic activity .
Lyn is not required for the interaction of Syk with the aggregated Ag receptor .
We demonstrate further that Lyn and Syk differentially regulate the dynamics of receptor internalization .
Syk stabilizes BCR signaling complexes at the plasma membrane , while Lyn is required for receptor internalization .
Materials and Methods Plasmids , constructs , and transfections An Xhol/Hpal DNA fragment encoding Syk was cut from EPB : SykMyc ( 19 ) .
Insertion of this fragment into Xhol/Smal sites of the pEGFP-N2 vector ( Clon-tech , Palo Alto , CA ) resulted in a fusion of Syk and enhanced GFP ( SykEGEFP ) .
The same approach was used to add the open reading frame of enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) to the C-terminus of a catalytically inactive form of Syk ( Syk ( K396R ) ) ( 20 ) to generate KDEGFP .
Two oligonucleotides ( 5'-GCTCTGCAGAAAAAGTTGGAAGAGCTTGAGCTGGATGAGC-3 ' and 5-GCTCATCCAGCTCAAGCTCTTCCAACTTTTTCTGCAGAGCCT-3 '' ) , which encode the nuclear export signal from Xenopus mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( 21 ) , were synthesized , annealed , and inserted in-frame into BsrG/NofI sites at the 3 ' end of the coding sequence for SykEGFP to make a construct for the expression of pSykEGFPNES .
Syk-deficient ( 1 ) or Syk- and Lyn-deficient ( Syk/Lyn-deficient ) ( 22 ) chicken DT4O0 B cells ( 1 X 10° ) were transfected with 20 pg of each DNA construct as previously described ( 20 ) .
Human DG75 B cells were electropo-rated using 20 ug of each DNA construct at 300 V and 800 uF .
Cells were analyzed 24-36 h post-transfection .
DT4O0 B cell lines were obtained from Drs .
Tomohiro Kurosaki ( Kansai Medical University , Osaka , Japan ) and Ellen Puré ( The Wistar Institute , Philadelphia , PA ) .
Fluorescence and confocal microscopy Unstimulated cells were adhered to coverslips precoated with poly-L-lysine ( 100 ug/ml ; Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) for 10 min at room temperature .
Cells stimulated by either goat anti-chicken IgM Abs ( Bethyl Laboratories , Montgomery , TX ) or Texas Red-conjugated anti-IgM Abs were adhered to coverslips 5-10 min before the end of stimulation at 37°C .
Texas Red was conjugated to goat anti-chicken IgM using the FluoReporter Texas Red-X protein labeling kit from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) .
Cells were fixed in 3.7 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature , washed three times with PBS , stained with 4,6-diamidinao-2-phenylindole ( Sigma ) and viewed by fluorescence microscopy .
Cells undergoing subsequent staining with anti-human Ig-B Ab were preincubated with blocking buffer ( 3 % BSA , 1 % goat serum in PBS ) for 30 min followed by incubation with R-PE-conjugated monoclonal anti-human Ig-B Ab ( Ancell , Bayport , MN ) diluted in the blocking buffer for 1 h. Conventional fluorescence was examined using an Olympus BH2-RFCA fluorescence microscope with X60 objective equipped with a Sony DXC-950 3CCD color video camera and Northern Eclipse 5.0 software from Empix Imaging ( Mississauga , Canada ) .
Laser scanning microscopy was performed with a Nikon Optiphot microscope ( Melville , NY ) and a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 system ( Hercules , CA ) using an argon/krypton laser and an E2/UBHS filter set .
The reported percentages of cells responding to a given stimulus represent data from a typical experiment and include an examination in each case of > 100 cells .
Similar data were obtained in two additional trials .
In one experiment cells expressing SykEGFPNES were pretreated with leptomycin B ( 23 ) at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for 60 min before fixation and examination by fluorescence microscopy .
Leptomycin B was a gift from Dr. Minoru Yo-shida ( University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan ) .
For real-time observation of live cells , 1 X 10° transfected cells were adhered to glass coverslips .
Immediately after exposure to RPMI medium containing 20 pg/ml of goat anti-IgM Ab , cells were observed under the microscope , and a picture was taken as time zero of stimulation .
The cells remained in the presence of anti-IgM Abs and were photographed at timed intervals .
Promoter-linked luciferase assays Syk-deficient DT4O0 cells ( 1 X 10 '' ) were transfected by electroporation with vectors containing cDNAs for the various EGFP- or epitope-tagged SYK-RECEPTOR INTERACTIONS IN B CELLS forms of Syk or Syk mutants ( 20 ug ) and an NF-AT-luciferase reporter plasmid ( 10 ug ) ( 20 ) .
Cells were harvested 36 h following transfection , plated at a density of 1 X 10° cells/ml , and activated with anti-IgM Abs ( 10 pg/ml ) or a mixture of PMA ( 50 ng/ml ) and ionomycin ( 1.0 wM ) for 6 h at 37°C .
Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
Luciferase activity is expressed as a fraction of that activity observed with activation by PMA plus ionomycin .
Western blot analysis For the detection of fusion proteins by Western blot analysis , proteins in extracts from resting or activated cells were separated by SDS-PAGE , transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes , and probed with an anti-GFP Ab ( Clontech ) and an HRP-conjugated secondary Ab .
The Ag-Ab complex was visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system .
For the detection of epitope-tagged Syk , proteins were first immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an anti-Myc mAb and then probed by Western blotting with anti-Syk Abs ( 24 ) .
The 9E10 anti-Myc hybridoma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) .
Results Expression of SykEGFP in DT4O0 B cells To prepare a form of Syk that could be visualized in intact cells , we constructed a mammalian expression vector with the coding sequence for a form of GFP with enhanced fluorescent properties ( EGFP ) inserted downstream from the cDNA coding for wild-type murine Syk ( SykEGFP ) .
A schematic diagram showing the orientation of the two proteins within the chimera is shown in Fig .
1A .
The resulting cDNA was transfected into Syk-deficient DT4O B cells .
Immunoblotting analysis using anti-GFP Abs confirmed the expression of the fusion protein only in cells transfected with the plasmid containing the cDNA coding for SykEGFP ( Fig .
1B ) .
A single protein was detected that migrated at M , 100,000 , the expected size of the intact fusion protein .
Smaller , proteolytic fragments of SykEGFP containing the GFP domain were not detected .
It was important to establish that the SykEGFP fusion protein was functionally active when expressed in B cells .
Activation of the transcription factor , NF-AT , is uncoupled from the BCR in cells that lack Syk , but can be restored by the re-expression of the enzyme and provides a convenient assay for monitoring BCR-stimulated signaling events .
Therefore , Syk-deficient DT4O B cells were cotransfected with either the vector coding for SykEGFP or an expression vector coding for wild-type murine Syk ( Syk ( WT ) ) ( 19 ) together with an NF-AT-driven luciferase reporter construct .
The expression of SykEGFP restored the receptor-mediated activation of NF-AT activity to the Syk-deficient cells to an extent comparable to that observed in cells transfected with Syk ( WT ) ( Fig .
1C ) .
The extent of NF-AT activation observed in cells expressing SykEGFP and Syk ( WT ) was comparable over a wide range of concentrations of transfected plasmid and a wide range of concentrations of activating Ab ( data not shown ) .
The extent of receptor-mediated activation of NF-AT in DT4O cells expressing Syk ( WT ) or SykEGFP is comparable to that observed in wild-type DT4O cells ( data not shown ) .
As a control , a catalytically inactive form of SykEGFP was prepared with a point mutation at a critical lysine residue in the active site ( KDEGFP ) .
The expression of KDEGFP was unable to rescue signaling in the Syk-deficient cells ( Fig .
1C ) .
Likewise , the expression of EGFP alone was unable to rescue signaling ( Fig .
1C ) .
These studies indicate that SykEGFP can replace endogenous Syk for coupling the BCR to the activation of NF-AT .
Localization of SykEGFP in DT4O0 B cells To examine the intracellular localization of the fusion protein , we transfected Syk-deficient DT4O B cells with the SykEGFP expression plasmid .
Cells were then fixed and examined by both fluorescence and confocal microscopy .

Transfected cells either remained unactivated ( ] ) or were activated by treatment with anti-IgM Abs ( MB ) .
Relative luciferase activity is reported as the activity observed under the experimental conditions divided by the activity produced in response to stimulation with a mixture of PMA and ionomycin .
The values represent the mean and SD of three separate analyses .
Fig .
2 .
The Syk fusion protein was localized throughout the interior of the cell in both the cytoplasm and nucleus , but was excluded from nucleoli ( Fig .
2 , A and B ) .
This same distribution was observed for the catalytically inactive KDEGFP ( Fig .
2 , C and D ) , indicating that the presence or the absence of catalytic activity did not affect localization of the kinase in resting cells .
SykEGFP and KDEGFP appeared in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells , whether expressed at abundant levels or in trace amounts .
The localization of a fraction of SykEGFP to the nucleus could be verified by contrasting its appearance in transfected 1509 FIGURE 2 .
- SykEGEFP is localized to both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments .
Syk-deficient DT4O0 B cells were transfected with plasmids directing the expression of SykEGFP ( A and B ) , KDEGFP ( C and D ) , or SykEGFPNES ( E and F ) and examined 36 h posttransfection by fluorescence ( A , C , and £ ) or confocal microscopy ( B , D , and F ) .
The bar in E represents 5 wm for A , C , and E , and the bar in F represents 1 wm for B , D , and F. cells with that of a variant of SykEGFP prepared with a short nuclear export signal ( NES ) added to the carboxyl terminus ( SykEGFPNES ) .
SykEGFPNES , when expressed in Syk-deficient cells , was excluded from the nucleus and restricted in its localization to the cytoplasmic compartment ( Fig .
2 , E and F ; the location of the nucleus was verified in all cells by staining with 4,6-diamidinao-2-phenylindole ; data not shown ) .
The staining pattern observed by fluorescence or confocal microscopy of cells expressing SykEGFPNES was clearly distinct from that observed for cells expressing SykEGFP or KDEGFP .
The exclusion of SykEGFPNES from the nucleus could be reversed by treatment of the cells with leptomycin B , a specific inhibitor of NES-mediated nuclear export ( 23 ) ( data not shown ) .
This result indicated that the peptide that was added to the carboxyl terminus of SykEGFP to form SykEGFPNES was indeed functioning as a nuclear export signal ( data not shown ) .
This nuclear-excluded form of Syk was able to restore the BCR-stimulated activation of NF-AT to Syk-deficient cells as efficiently as SykEGFP or Syk ( WT ) ( Fig .
1C ) .
Redistribution of SykEGFP to the cross-linked BCR BCR cross-linking is thought to promote the physical association of SykEGFP with the receptor .
To confirm this , we treated Syk-deficient DT4O cells expressing SykEGFP with affinity-purified anti-IgM Abs conjugated with Texas Red dye to allow visualization of the surface IgM component of the BCR by confocal microscopy .
In untreated cells , IgM was uniformly distributed around 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG 1510 the cell surface ( Fig .
3C ) , and there was no obvious colocalization of SykEGEFP with the receptor ( Fig .
3 , A and B ) .
When cells were stimulated by the addition of the fluorescently tagged anti-IgM Abs , the surface IgM first formed membrane patches of variable sizes ( Fig .
3F ) .
The patching of cell surface receptors was more easily observed at 25 than at 37°C because the redistribution of the patches into caps occurred more slowly .
When the patches of cell surface IgM formed , SykEGFP also began to form aggregates ( Fig .
3D ) .
These colocalized with the patched IgM ( Fig .
36 ) , consistent with recruitment of SykEGFP to the clustered receptors .
By 20 min at 37°C , the patched receptors had aggregated to form a cap at one pole of the cell ( Fig .
37 ) .
SykEGFP was also redistributed to a single cap that colocalized with the capped surface Ig ( Fig .
3 , G and H7 ) .
Further incubation of the stimulated cells resulted in the SykEGFP SykEGFP + IgM SykEGEFP _ SykEGFP + Ig FIGURE 3 .
- SykEGFP colocalizes with surface IgM and Ig-B in anti-IgM-activated B cells .
A-L , Syk-deficient DT4O cells expressing SykEGFP were stimulated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-IgM Abs for 0 min ( A-C ) , for 10 min at 25°C ( D-F ) , or for 20 min ( G-I ) or 60 min ( J-L ) at 37°C .
Cells were then fixed and examined by confocal microscopy .

SYK-RECEPTOR INTERACTIONS IN B CELLS appearance of IgM in small aggregates that were present in the interior of the cell due to internalization of the IgM in endocytic vesicles ( Fig .
31 ) .
At this stage , there was no obvious accumulation of SykEGFP at the sites of internalized IgM ( Fig .
3J ) .
To further confirm a colocalization of SykEGFP with components of the BCR complex , we transfected human DG75 B cells with the plasmid expressing SykEGFP and then treated the cells with anti-human IgM Abs .
Treated cells were stained using an anti-Ig-B mAb and a tetramethyIrhodamine isothiocyanate-conju-gated secondary Ab .
Human B cells were used for this experiment due to the availability of anti-human Ig-B Abs .
After a 30-min stimulation , Ig-B was clustered near one pole of the cell ( Fig .
30 ) .
A portion of the SykEGFP was also clustered and colocalized with Ig-B ( Fig .
3 , M and N ) .
In these anti-IgM-stimulated DG75 cells , both SykEGFP and Ig-B also colocalized with surface IgM ( data not shown ) .
These data are consistent with the recruitment of SykEGFP to the site of the clustered BCR complex .
Several control experiments were conducted to further confirm the receptor-mediated relocalization of SykEGFP into membrane-associated patches and caps .
To confirm that the redistribution of SykEGFP occurred in this fashion within individual cells , we examined changes in the localization of SykEGFP following BCR cross-linking in live cells as a function of time .
Syk-deficient DT4O cells expressing SykEGFP were treated with anti-IgM Abs at room temperature and then examined by fluorescence microscopy at various time points without fixation to allow events in single cells to be monitored ( Fig .
4 , A-D ) .
In most cells , SykEGFP initially redistributed to the plasma membrane , moved to one hemisphere of the cell , and eventually formed a single cap at one pole .
This was especially prominent in cells expressing lower levels of SykEGFP .
The redistribution of the fusion protein was more difficult to visualize in cells with high levels of expression of SykEGFP , suggesting that the membrane-associated binding sites to which SykEGFP was recruited were saturable .
SykEGEFP translocation to the plasma membrane could also be observed in live , SykEGFP-expressing , DG75 B cells that were then treated with anti-human IgM Abs ( data not shown ) .
Two additional experiments were conducted to establish the specificity of the SykEGEFP redistribution .
First , the effect of BCR cross-linking on the subcellular distribution of EGFP alone was examined .
EGFP was localized diffusely throughout cells that had been transfected with an EGFP expression plasmid ( Fig .
4 , E and F ) .
Its distribution , however , remained unchanged following BCR aggregation when examined at multiple time points following receptor engagement ( shown here for a 30-min treatment at room temperature ) .
Secondly , Syk-deficient DT4O B cells expressing SykEGFP were treated with Con A to examine whether the redistribution of SykEGFP was a general phenomenon that accompanied the clustering and capping of a cell surface receptor other than IgM .
Following a 1-h treatment with Con A , Con A receptors were aggregated into a single cap without a concomitant redistribution of SykEGFP ( Fig .
4 , G and H ) .
Thus , the redistribution of SykEGFP was specific for both the Syk portion of the fusion protein and the cross-linking of surface Ig .
Finally , to determine the fraction of transfected cells that responded to treatment with anti-IgM Abs through the redistribution of SykEGFP , we monitored the changes in SykEGEFP localization in response to receptor cross-linking in populations of SykEGFP-expressing cells as a function of time after B cell activation .
Cells were classified into one of five categories depending on the distribution of SykEGEFP in the cell ( Fig .
5A ) .
These categories were : resting , a distribution of SykEGFP throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus ; patched ( I ) , patches of SykEGFP appearing at the plasma membrane before capping ; capped , SykEGFP appearing in a single 6107 '01 Aepy uo isan $ 4q 310 founwurrf'mmm// : dyy wo papeojumoG The Journal of Immunology O min 5 min SykECGFP~DT4O-Syk - SykECGFP~DT40-Syk as 5 BER A < SykEGFP _ Con A c 44 [ ® H Ag FIGURE 4 .

In > 98 % of unstimulated cells , SykEGFP exhibited a diffuse distribution throughout the cell corresponding to the resting phenotype ( Fig .
5B ) .
After 5 min of treatment with anti-IgM Abs at 37°C , SykEGFP was present in membrane patches ( 58 % ) or caps ( 33 % ) in the majority of the cells .
After BCR ligation for 10 min , SykEGFP appeared predominately in cell surface caps ( 85 % ) .
By 1 h poststimulation , most of the SykEGFP was absent from the plasma membrane , except for a few brightly staining clusters ( patched , II ) .
These were still associated with the few small clusters of IgM ( as determined by staining with Texas Red-conjugated anti-IgM Abs , data not shown ) that had not undergone internalization .
By 3 h after stimulation , SykEGFP was no longer observed in clusters in the majority of cells and was once again present in a diffuse staining pattern .
In approximately 50 % of these cells , however , SykEGFP was confined to the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus .
By 6 h , 90 % of the cells had returned to the diffuse SykEGFP distribution pattern that characterized the unstimulated cells .

At least 100 cells were scored at each time point .
The data shown are representative of three separate experiments .
Lyn is not required for the recruitment of SykEGFP to the BCR Lyn is thought to be an important kinase acting upstream of Syk to promote its recruitment to the BCR .
To determine whether Lyn expression was required for the redistribution of SykEGFP to the cross-linked BCR , we expressed the fusion protein in DT4O B cells in which either the gene for Syk ( Syk-deficient ) or the genes for both Syk and Lyn ( Syk/Lyn-deficient ) had been disrupted .
In unstimulated cells , the intracellular distribution of SykEGFP in Syk/ Lyn-deficient cells was indistinguishable from that described above for SykEGFP expressed in Syk-deficient cells ( data not shown ) .
Following a 10-min treatment with activating Ab at 37°C , SykEGFP was recruited to the plasma membrane in both cell types and appeared in most cells as a single cap at the cell surface ( Fig .
6 , A and C ) that colocalized with the capped surface IgM ( data not shown ) .
An analysis of multiple transfected cells indicated that the initial cocapping of SykEGFP with the BCR was similar for the Syk-deficient and the Syk/Lyn-deficient cells after 10 min of stimulation ( Table I ) .
Interestingly , however , SykEGFP expressed in the Syk/Lyn-deficient cells remained in membrane caps following 60 min of activation in the majority of the cells ( Fig .
6D and Table I ) .
These caps persisted for 6 h ( the longest time point examined ) following addition of the anti-IgM Ab ( data not shown ) .
This is in sharp contrast to SykEGFP expressed in Syk-deficient cells , which was present in only a few small clusters at the plasma membrane after 60 min of treatment with anti-IgM Abs ( Fig .
6B and Table I ) and was absent from the membrane after 6 h of treatment ( Fig .
5B ) .

The BCR-stimulated redistribution of SykEGFP and KDEGEFP is influenced by the presence or the absence of Lyn .
Syk-deficient ( A , B , E , and F ) or Syk- and Lyn-deficient ( C , D , G , and H ) DT4O0 B cells expressing SykEGFP ( A-D ) or KDEGFP ( E-H ) were stimulated at 37°C with anti-IgM Abs for 10 min ( A , D , E , and G ) or 60 min ( B , D , F , and H ) .
Cells were then fixed and examined by fluorescence microscopy .

Bar = 5 um .
Thus , the presence of SykEGFP in membrane caps is prolonged in the absence of Lyn .
A catalytically inactive Syk can be recruited to the BCR The `` kinase-dead '' KDEGFP mutant was used to monitor the receptor-mediated redistribution of the enzyme in the absence of intrinsic catalytic activity .
KDEGFP was expressed in both the Syk-deficient and the Syk/Lyn-deficient DT4O B cells , and the effect of receptor cross-linking on its intracellular localization was monitored .
In resting cells of both types , KDEGFP was distributed normally throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm ( Fig .
2 and data not shown ) .
In the majority of Syk-deficient cells , BCR cross-linking led to the appearance of clusters of KDEGEFP at the plasma membrane ( Fig .
6E and Table I ) .
However , this redistribution was less robust than that observed in cells expressing the catalytically active SykEGFP .
After 10 min of treatment with anti-IgM Abs , 63 % of the transfected cells exhibited some degree of KDEGFP redistribution to the plasma membrane .
At this time , KDEGFP appeared primarily in clusters of small patches that resembled those observed in Syk-deficient cells expressing SykEGFP that had SYK-RECEPTOR INTERACTIONS IN B CELLS been treated with anti-IgM Abs for 60 min ( Fig .
6B ) .
Most of these small patches of KDEGFP had disappeared by 60 min of treatment with anti-IgM ( Fig .
6F ) .
The appearance of clusters of KDEGFP at the plasma membrane was further blunted in cells lacking both Syk and Lyn ( Fig .
6G and Table I ) .
In approximately 50 % of the cells , no obvious change in the subcellular distribution of KDEGFP could be observed following aggregation of the BCR .
In the other 50 % , only a relatively limited amount of KDEFGP appeared in membrane patches ( Fig .
6G ) .
These aggregates of KDEGFP at the plasma membrane persisted for at least 60 min following receptor aggregation ( Fig .
6M ) .
It is interesting to note that some clustering of KDEGEFP can occur in response to BCR cross-linking even in cells lacking Lyn and an active form of Syk .
Syk and Lyn differentially regulate receptor clustering and internalization Differences in the appearance of the clustered , fluorescently tagged Syk molecules in cells lacking catalytically active Syk or Lyn suggested that these kinases might play important roles in modulating BCR dynamics following receptor aggregation .
As a consequence , the fate of aggregated BCR complexes in DT4O cells treated with anti-IgM Abs for various periods of time was monitored using the fluorescently tagged anti-IgM Ab .
In wild-type DT4O cells , which express normal levels of endogenous Lyn and Syk , treatment with anti-IgM Abs led to the formation of surface IgM aggregates , which had redistributed into caps in the majority of cells by 10 min ( Figs .
7B and 8 ) .
Only 12 % of the cells exhibited internalized receptors at this time .
By 60 min in the majority of cells the receptors had been internalized ( Fig .
8 ) .
By fluorescence microscopy , internalized IgM appeared as a mass of punctate spots seen when focusing on the interior of the cell ( Fig .
7C ) .
In DT4O cells lacking Lyn , treatment with anti-IgM Abs led to a rapid clustering and redistribution of surface IgM into tightly formed polar caps ( Fig .
7 , D and E ) .
These capped receptors persisted at the cell surface and failed to become internalized even after 60 min of treatment with anti-IgM Abs ( Fig .
8 ) .
The caps appeared in immunofluorescence images as bright clusters of stained receptors seen by focussing on the surfaces of the cells ( Fig .
7F ) .
These results are consistent with a requirement for Lyn for receptor internalization .
In cells lacking Syk , treatment with anti-IgM Abs also led to receptor clustering and the movement of clustered receptors to a single pole of the cell ( Fig .
7G ) .
However , few cells formed tightly capped receptors , and receptor internalization occurred rapidly , with 48 % of the cells exhibiting internalized receptors within 10 min of treatment with anti-IgM Abs ( Fig .
8 ) .
By 60 min , nearly all cells had internalized receptors ( Fig .
8 ) , which appeared within the cell as small , punctate clusters ( Fig .
77 ) .
Thus , Syk appears to be necessary for the stable appearance of tightly capped receptor complexes at the cell surface .
DT4O cells lacking both Syk and Lyn demonstrated a composite of the defects observed in the single kinase-deficient lines .
In these cells , receptors were also aggregated by treatment with anti-IgM Abs ( Fig .
7 , J and K ) .
The clustered BCR complexes redistributed to one hemisphere of the cell , but failed to form tightly clustered caps .
These clustered Igs remained on the cell surface for an extended period of time , with no receptor internalization observed by 60 min following receptor aggregation ( Figs .
77 and 8 ) .
Similar results were observed using an FITC-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgM Ab .
The fluorescence of the extracellular fluo-rescein can be quenched selectively by a reduction in the pH of the medium .

which internalization does not occur ) with the fluorescein-conju-gated Ab indicated that 95 and 96 % , respectively , of the fluorescence could be quenched after acidification of the medium to pH 4.0 .
The fluorescence of Lyn-expressing cells treated with labeled Ab at 37°C for 30 min was quenched by only 32 % due to internalization of a majority of the receptors .
In contrast , the fluorescence of Lyn-deficient cells treated with Ab at 37°C for 30 min was quenched by 92 % , indicating that the receptors remained at the cell surface .
A role for Syk in the formation of tightly capped receptors could be confirmed by examining a mixed population of Syk/Lyn-deficient cells and Syk/Lyn-deficient cells expressing SykEGFP .
Following treatment with Texas Red-conjugated anti-IgM Abs , tightly capped receptor complexes appeared only in those cells expressing SykEGFP .
Tightly capped receptors were not observed in cells that did not express the tagged fusion protein ( Fig .
7 , M and N ) .
The appearance of these tightly capped receptors required Syk catalytic activity , since they also did not form in anti-IgM-treated cells that expressed the catalytically inactive KDEGEFP fusion protein ( Fig .
7 , O and P ) .
The small amount of KDEGFP that did relocate to the plasma membrane , however , colocalized with aggregated surface IgM .
However , many clusters of receptors lacked associated KDEGFP .
Syk-dependent activation of NF-AT is elevated in Lyn-negative DT4O0 B cells The redistribution studies indicated that in DT4O cells lacking Lyn , receptor cross-linking still led to the recruitment of SykEGFP to the clustered BCR , resulting in the formation of a long-lived re-ceptor-kinase complex .
Therefore , the ability of Syk to restore BCR-dependent signaling to cells deficient in Syk or deficient in both Syk and Lyn was examined .
In Syk-deficient cells , receptor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins was reduced compared with that in wild-type cells and was undetectable in cells lacking both Syk and Lyn ( Fig .
94 ) .
Ligation of the BCR by treatment with anti-IgM Abs was uncoupled from the activation of NF-AT , as measured using an NF-AT-driven luciferase reporter plasmid , in both cell types .
The restoration of Syk by transfection with a plasmid coding for Syk ( WT ) restored the BCR-stimulated activation of NF-AT to both cell types .
However , the BCR-stimulated activation of NF-AT in the cells lacking Lyn was 4-fold greater than that observed in the Lyn-expressing cells ( Fig .
9B ) despite the expression of similar amounts of Syk ( WT ) ( Fig .
9C ) .
The enhanced signaling in Lyn-deficient cells was also observed in cells transfected with the expression plasmid coding for SykEGFP in place of Syk ( WT ) ( data not shown ) .
Discussion The expression of proteins fused to GFP provides a useful , non-invasive methodology for monitoring changes in protein localization as a function of time and stimulus .
We have adapted this methodology to the investigation of Syk and Syk-receptor interactions in B cells .
The monitoring of cells expressing SykEGFP as a function of time following BCR cross-linking has provided the first visualization of the changes that Syk undergoes in its intracellular localization during B cell activation .
This approach has also uncovered several interesting roles for BCR-associated kinases in regulating receptor dynamics .
In unstimulated cells , SykEGEFP is localized to both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments , but is excluded from the nucleoli ( Fig .
2 ) .
In preliminary studies not illustrated here , we have been able also to demonstrate a similar distribution of endogenous Syk in human DG75 B cells by indirect immunofluorescence .
This subcellular distribution is consistent with the previously reported localization of a ZAP-70 GFP chimera ( 25 ) .
The nuclear localization of SykEGFP and ZAP-70 GFP raise the intriguing possibility that Syk family kinases have unrecognized nuclear functions that are independent of their roles as mediators of proximal Ag receptor signals .
At least one Syk function , coupling the BCR to the activation of NF-AT , is independent of its nuclear localization , since the attachment of a nuclear exclusion signal to the carboxyl terminus of SykEGFP does not reduce its activity in this assay ( Fig .
1C ) .
The large size of the SykEGFP chimera ( ~100 kDa ) precludes the possibility that it diffuses freely into and out of the nucleus through nuclear pores , and there is no evidence that the observed nuclear fluorescence of SykEGFP-expressing cells is a consequence of proteolysis of the fusion protein , as we could not detect the formation of smaller m.w .
species of protein containing the EGFP tag ( Fig .
1B ) .
Thus , the fusion protein must interact directly or indirectly through associated proteins with components of nuclear transport systems .
The transport of SykEGFP into and out of the nucleus is likely to be a dynamic process .

in the nucleus requires several hours .
This prolonged exclusion of the kinase from the nucleus occurs in cells expressing SykEGFP , but not in those expressing the catalytically inactive KDEGFP , which can not reconstitute receptor-mediated signaling .
Phosphorylation of the ITAMs of the BCR complex that leads to the recruitment of Syk is an activity normally attributed to members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases , of which Lyn is the only member expressed at any significant level in DT4O cells .
In fact , a catalytically inactive form of SykEGFP ( KDEFGP ) can be recruited to the cross-linked BCR in cells expressing Lyn and lacking Syk ( Fig .
66 ) .
This process appears relatively inefficient compared with the recruitment of a catalytically active form of SykEGFP , due in part to the rapid rate at which the receptors become internalized in the absence of an active Syk kinase ( Figs .
7 , G-I , and 8 ) .
However , as long as Syk retains intrinsic catalytic activity , Lyn is not required for its recruitment to the receptor , since this process is not compromised in Lyn-deficient cells ( Fig .
6 , C and D ) .
The most straightforward explanation for this observation is that Syk itself can catalyze the phosphorylation of receptor ITAMs .
The ability of Syk to catalyze the phosphorylation of Ig-a « in immune complexes ( 26 ) and to phosphorylate ITAM tyrosines in Lck-deficient Jurkat T cells ( 27 ) and CD45-deficient B cells ( 28 ) has been suggested by previous studies .
This apparent lack of a requirement for a Src family kinase for the recruitment of Syk to the BCR probably explains why receptor engagement in Lyn-deficient DT4O cells is still coupled to inositol 1,4,5-trisphos-phate production , calcium mobilization , and the activation of Akt/ protein kinase B ( 1 , 15 ) .
The Lyn-independent recruitment of Syk to the BCR requires that alternative mechanisms exist to promote the initial interaction of Syk with the receptor .
A possible explanation is suggested by the observation that even in the absence of both Lyn and a catalytically active form of Syk , a detectable fraction of kinase-inac-tive Syk ( KDEGFP ) still appears at sites of aggregated BCR complexes ( Fig .
6G and Fig .
7 , O and P ) .

occurs independently of receptor-stimulated protein tyrosine phos-phorylation , since this can not be detected in the Syk/Lyn-deficient DT4O cells following receptor aggregation ( Fig .
9A ) .
We think it is likely that the appearance of KDEGFP at the site of cross-linked BCR complexes reflects the aggregation of small amounts of KDEGFP preassociated with the unligated BCR .
A low level of Syk associated with the BCR was reported previously in unstimulated B cells ( 29 ) .
This preassociated Syk could conceivably initiate receptor phosphorylation and the recruitment of additional Syk molecules to the cross-linked receptor , bypassing the requirement for a member of the Sre family in the early events of B cell signaling .
The presence or the absence of Syk and Lyn in DT4O B cells has major effects on the dynamics of receptor aggregation and internalization .
The treatment of B cells with anti-IgM Abs leads first to the appearance of the BCR and its signaling component Ig-B 1515 ( and associated Ig-a ) in surface patches .
The formation of these receptor-containing patches and their initial redistribution to one hemisphere of the cell are independent of the expression of either Syk or Lyn .
If Syk is present , it is being actively recruited to the sites of the aggregated receptors during formation of the BCR-containing membrane patches .
These patches , with time , redistribute into a single cap .
The appearance of these caps is strongly influenced by the presence or the absence of Syk within the clustered BCR complex .
If Syk is absent , the receptor caps are large , relatively diffuse , and internalized rapidly if Lyn is present in the cells .
If Lyn is also absent , the receptor clusters that form are broad and cover one-quarter to one-half of the cell surface , where they remain for an extended period of time , indicating that Lyn is important for receptor internalization .
In the presence of Syk , the BCR redistributes into tightly clustered caps regardless of whether Lyn is expressed .
This effect requires the expression of a catalytically active form of Syk .
If Lyn is also expressed , the receptors in these caps are internalized , although at a slower rate than in Syk-deficient cells .
In the presence of Syk , but in the absence of Lyn , the tightly clustered receptors remain on the cell surface for an extended period of time ( at least 6 h ) .
Thus , Syk is required for the formation of tightly clustered caps of aggregated Ag receptors , and Lyn is required for receptor internalization .
A role for Lyn in receptor internalization is consistent with several studies that have used pharmacologic tyrosine kinase inhibitors to block BCR endocytosis ( 30-32 ) .
This suggests that one role for Lyn may be the down-regulation of activated receptors , since , in its absence , the Syk-BCR complexes that form following receptor cross-linking remain at the cell surface for a prolonged period of time ( Figs .
6D and 7F ) .
Thus , the activation of Lyn-deficient cells leads to a slow , but prolonged , increase in cytosolic free calcium ( 1 ) and an enhanced activation of NF-AT ( Fig .
9B ) .
It is possible that reduced receptor internalization may contribute to the hyper-responsiveness to IgM cross-linking that is observed in B cells from Lyn-deficient mice , which also demonstrate a delayed , but prolonged , calcium response ( 17 ) , but this has not been determined .
The capping of surface IgM is an energy-dependent process that is mediated by the contractile activity of the actomyosin peripheral cytoskeleton and is inhibited by the treatment of cells with cy-tochalasin D , which disrupts actin microfilaments .
A requirement for Syk has been demonstrated previously for the increased assembly of cortical actin in DT4O cells following the cross-linking of expressed Fc y subunits ( 33 ) .
Thus , Syk might influence the clustering of receptors by regulating aspects of the actin assembly process important for the formation of the tightly clustered and capped receptor complexes .
How this affects the overall process of receptor internalization and subsequent trafficking is not known .
However , it is known that dominant-negative mutants of Syk inhibit Ag presentation ( 34 ) , which requires the proper uptake and delivery of BCR-Ag complexes to MHC II-containing endosomes , the assembly of which is inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( 35 ) .
Thus , both Lyn and Syk play important roles in regulating Ag receptor dynamics in B cells .
