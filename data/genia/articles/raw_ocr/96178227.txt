3000DR Rotterdam , The Netherlands The nuclear distribution of GATA transcription factors in murine haemopoietic cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence .
Specific bright foci of GATA-1 fluorescence were observed in erythroleukaemia cells and primary murine erythroblasts and megakaryocytes , in addition to diffuse nucleoplasmic localization .
These foci , which were preferentially found adjacent to nucleoli or at the nuclear periphery , did not represent sites of active transcription or binding of GATA-1 to consensus sites in the fB-globin loci .
Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the presence of intensely labelled structures likely to represent the GATA-1 foci seen by immunofluorescence .
The GATA-1 nuclear bodies differed from previously described nuclear structures and there was no co-localization with nuclear antigens involved in RNA processing or other ubiquitous ( Spl , c-Jun and TBP ) or haemopoietic ( NF-E2 ) transcription factors .
Interestingly , GATA-2 and GATA-3 proteins also localized to the same nuclear bodies in cell lines co-expressing GATA-1 and -2 or GATA-1 and -3 gene products .
This pattern of distribution is , thus far , unique to the GATA transcription factors and suggests a protein-protein interaction with other components of the nuclear bodies via the GATA zinc finger domain .
Keywords : GATA proteins/nuclear bodies/transcription factor Introduction The GATA nuclear transcription factors comprise a family of proteins which bind the DNA sequence ( A/T ) GATA- ( A/G ) via a highly conserved zinc finger domain ( Wall et al. , 1988 ; Evans and Felsenfeld , 1989 ; Tsai et al. , 1989 ; Orkin , 1992 ) .
Currently six members have been identified in avians , with homologues in mammals and amphibians ( Laverriere et al. , 1994 ) .
GATA binding proteins have also been cloned from fungi , yeast , flies and worms ( Kudla et al. , 1990 ; Cunningham and Cooper , 1991 ; Spieth et al. , Â© Oxford University Press 1991 ; Abel et al. , 1993 ) , attesting to the evolutionary conservation of this class of genes .
Through their expression profiles the GATA proteins may be distinguished as haemopoietic ( GATA-1 to -3 ) and non-haemopoietic ( GATA-4 to -6 ) , a functional grouping which mirrors their structural similarities .
Cells of the erythroid , megakaryocytic and mast cell lineages are the major sites of GATA-1 expression , but the protein is also expressed at low levels in multipotential cells and in the Sertoli cells of the testis ( Crotta et al. , 1990 ; Martin et al. , 1990 ; Romeo et al. , 1990 ; Yamamoto et al. , 1990 ; Sposi et al. , 1992 ; Ito et al. , 1993 ; Weiss and Orkin , 1995 ) .
Whilst GATA-2 shares expression in megakaryocytes and mast cells , it is also found in populations enriched for haemopoietic stem and progenitor cells , endothelial cells and embryonic brain ( Wilson et al. , 1990 ; Yamamoto et al. , 1990 ; Lee et al. , 1991 ; Dorfman et al. , 1992 ) .
In the chicken GATA-3 is expressed in erythroid cells , but mammalian expression is mainly restricted to T lymphocytes and the embryonic nervous system ( Yamamoto et al. , 1990 ; Ho et al. , 1991 ; Joulin et al. , 1991 ; Ko et al. , 1991 ) .
Consistent with these patterns of expression , functionally important GATA binding sites are present in the cis regulatory elements of many haemopoietically restricted genes in erythroblasts , megakaryocytes , mast cells and T cells ( Weiss and Orkin , 1995 ) .
The non-haemopoietic GATA transcription factors ( GATA-4 to -6 ) are expressed in the heart , intestine and diverse tissues such as ovary , liver , lungs or spleen ( Arceci et al. , 1993 ; Kelley et al. , 1993 ; Laverriere et al. , 1994 ) .
Our understanding of the normal role of haemopoietic GATA proteins is largely based on gene ablation studies .
ES cells mutant at the GATA-1 locus fail to contribute to the erythroid lineage of chimeric mice ( Pevny et al. , 1991 ) and detailed in vitro analyses demonstrate an absence of erythropoietin-responsive primitive erythroid precursors and a block in differentiation of definitive erythroid precursors ( defined by their response to the combination of kit ligand and erythropoietin ) at the proerythroblast stage ( Weiss et al. , 1994 ) .
Interestingly , formation of other haemopoietic lineages , including mast cells and megakaryocytes ( which express both GATA-1 and GATA-2 ) is not affected ( Pevny et al. , 1995 ) .
Expression of heterologous GATA binding proteins , or even the zinc fingers alone , under the control of GATA-1 regulatory sequences is able to rescue the phenotype in vitro , suggesting a degree of functional redundancy within the family ( Blobel et al. , 1995 ) .
Mice deficient in GATA-2 die at embryonic day 10-11 and display widespread defects in haemopoiesis ( Tsai et al. , 1994 ) .
These findings are consistent with a role for GATA-2 at an earlier stage in haemopoiesis than GATA-1 .
Finally , GATA-3-deficient mice also die at embryonic day 11-12 with a failure of fetal haemopoiesis and defects in the nervous system ( Pandolfi et al. , 1995 ) .

Murine erythroleukaemia ( MEL ) cells represent neo-plastic erythroid progenitors derived from the spleens of susceptible mice infected with the Friend virus complex ( Friend and Pogo , 1985 ) .
They proliferate in the absence of exogenously added growth factors and undergo inducible erythroid differentiation upon exposure to various chemi-cals , most notably dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) and hexa-methylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) ( Friend et al. , 1971 ) .
Induction faithfully reproduces many of the features of in vivo erythroid differentiation , including haemoglobin synthesis , cessation of division and morphological changes that culminate in enucleation .
Thus MEL cells represent a good in vitro model in which genes influencing erythroid differentiation may be analysed .
As part of our ongoing investigation into the role of GATA-1 and related transcription factors in haemopoiesis we have examined the distribution of GATA proteins within the nucleus of MEL cells and primary murine haemopoietic cells .
In addition to the anticipated diffuse nucleoplasmic localization , we show that GATA-1 localizes to novel nuclear bodies , distinct from previously described structures , within erythroleukaemic cells and also primary murine erythroblasts and megakaryocytes .
A similar localization was demonstrated for GATA-2 and GATA-3 in cell lines co-expressing GATA-1 and -2 or GATA-1 and -3 gene products .
If the interaction with nuclear bodies involves the conserved GATA zinc finger region , the DNA binding domain may also play a role in protein-protein interactions .
Results Focal accumulations of GATA-1 protein in MEL cells Staining of C88 MEL cells ( Deisseroth and Hendrick , 1978 ) with a GATA-1 -specific monoclonal antibody ( N6 ) ( Ito et al. , 1993 ) demonstrated an unexpected finding : one or two discrete foci of intense fluorescence were present in most cells , in addition to the anticipated pattern of diffuse granular nucleoplasmic fluorescence which was excluded from the nucleoli ( Figure 1A ) .
Up to six GATA-1 foci/cell were observed when different MEL cell lines were stained ( Figure 1B and data not shown ) , although the modal number of foci remained between one and three .
In the occasional multinucleate erythroblast ( see Figure 1C for an example ) there was a clear correlation between nuclear ploidy and the number of foci .
Close examination revealed that the GATA-1 foci were not randomly distributed , but were preferentially located adjacent to nucleoli or at the nuclear periphery .
This is readily appreciated in the single optical section through the multinucleate erythroblast shown in Figure 1D , where several foci clustering around a nucleolus are arrowed and foci at the nuclear periphery are indicated with an arrowhead .
Infrequently foci were present side by side in pairs ( arrowed in Figure 1E ) , as if they had undergone 'replication ' .
Epitope-tagged GATA-1 co-localizes with endogenous GATA-1 To ensure that our findings did not represent an antibody staining artefact we constructed GATA-1 expression vectors in which sequences from the human mye gene or 320 Fig .

the influenza virus haemagglutinin gene were fused in-frame to the N-terminal of a murine GATA-1 minigene ( Figure 2A ) .
These genes were then incorporated into the human -globin locus control region ( BLCR ) expression vector ( Collis et al. , 1990 ; Needham et al. , 1992 ) and used to generate stable transfectants of C88 MEL cells which were then cloned in soft agar .
The BLCR conferred copy number-dependent high level expression on the linked gene when the MEL cells were induced to undergo erythroid differentiation with DMSO .
Nuclear extracts made from parental and transfected MEL clones and from the T cell line EL-4 were immuno-blotted and probed with anti-GATA-1 antibody or antibodies specific for the epitope tags .
As shown in Figure 2B , the anti-GATA-1 antibody specifically recognized endogenous GATA-1 in both uninduced ( Figure 2B , lanes 2 and 4 ) and induced cells ( lanes 3 and 5 ) .
Note that GATA-3 in extracts of the T cell line EL-4 ( lane 1 ) was not detected .
Epitope-tagged GATA-1 was readily distinguished from endogenous GATA-1 by its slightly slower electrophoretic mobility ( lane 5 ) .

of nuclear extracts loaded on the gel resulted in endogenous GATA-1 signals of approximately equal intensity in all lanes , although on a 'per cell ' basis GATA-1 expression decreased following 4 days of induced differentiation , since the induced extracts were derived from twice the number of cells .
Very little of the epitope-tagged protein was present in uninduced clone 3.36 ( a MEL clone harbouring the myc epitope-tagged GATA-1 gene ) , but , following DMSO treatment , abundant protein was produced ( Figure 2C , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Identical results were obtained with MEL clones harbouring inducible haemagglutinin-tagged GATA-1 ( data not shown ) .
There was no evidence for down-regulation of endogenous GATA-1 protein following induction of the tagged gene .
We next examined GATA-1 expression in clone 3.36 cells by immunofluorescence .
When uninduced cells were double stained with antibodies to native and myc-tagged GATA-1 endogenous GATA-1 was readily detectable in all cells , but the tagged protein was only apparent in rare cells , consistent with the low frequency of spontaneous differentiating MEL cells observed in culture ( data not shown ) .
Following induction both anti-GATA-1 and anti-mye antibodies showed the same focal pattern of fluorescence ( Figure 2D , left and centre ) .
The foci detected by both antibodies co-localized when the images were overlayed ( Figure 2D , right ) , demonstrating that myc-tagged GATA-1 protein was present in all the foci targetted by the endogenous protein .
The same findings were documented with the haemagglutinin-tagged GATA-1 gene ( data not shown ) .
Thus GATA-l-associated nuclear foci were observed with three independent antibodies and the epitope-tagged and endogenous proteins co-localized , establishing that this finding was neither spurious nor artefactual .
322 GATA-1 foci and protein level decrease with differentiation The terminal differentiation of MEL cells is marked by a dramatic alteration in the transcriptional status of the cell , resulting in a decrease in total RNA and protein per cell , but a large increase in the synthesis of erythroid-specific products such as globins ( Antoniou , 1991 ) .
These changes are paralleled by a major reorganization in the pre-mRNA splicing machinery within the nucleus ( Antoniou et a/. , 1993 ) .
Therefore , we examined C88 MEL and clone 3.36 cells by immunofluorescence ( Figure 3 ) during differentiation to investigate the decrease in GATA-1 protein per cell predicted by Western blotting ( Figure 2B and C ) .
All samples were stained simultaneously and the same laser settings were used to capture and process the images , to allow comparison of the relative fluorescence intensities .
The cells were stained for haemoglobin expression to monitor the degree of erythroid induction .
Following treatment with DMSO we observed a decrease in the intensity of GATA-1 staining in untransfected C88 cells , consistent with the immunoblot analysis shown in Figure 2 , though there was considerable cell-to-cell variation ( Figure 3 , left ) .
Interestingly , the number of cells containing GATA-1 foci decreased from 98 to 77 % ( Table I ) .
In contrast , the overall level of GATA-1 immunofluorescence increased in DMSO-treated 3.36 cells ( Figure 3 , right ) , consistent with the induction of tagged GATA-1 regulated by the BLCR .
In these cells there was no decrease in the percentage of cells with GATA foci ( Table I ) , suggesting that visualization of the foci depended upon high levels of GATA-1 , not the stage of MEL cell differentiation .

The total number of cells counted ( n ) in several experiments is indicated .
suggested they remain present throughout the Gy , G ; , S and G ; , phases of the cell cycle .
When mitotic cells were examined foci could be identified in ~80 % of cases .
In the example shown ( Figure 4 ) a telophase cell double stained with antibodies to GATA-I ( in green ) and to the mitotic spindle protein ( -tubulin ( in red ) clearly displays GATA-1 foci , physically distinct from the mitotic spindle , in both forming daughter nuclei .
GATA-1 staining was invariably weak in mitotic cells ( which do not have an intact nuclear membrane ) , presumably because much of the soluble nuclear protein was lost during the permeabilization and fixation steps .
GATA-1 foci are seen in murine primary erythroblasts and megakaryocytes To determine whether the GATA-1 foci observed in MEL cells reflected the staining pattern of primary haemopoietic cells , nucleated erythroblasts at different developmental time points were stained for GATA-1 expression .
Bright foci of GATA-1 fluorescence were observed in cells from embryonic day 10.5 yolk sac and blood .
( Figure 5A and B ) ( examples of primitive erythropoiesis ) and fetal liver erythroblasts from days 11.5 to 14.5 ( Figure 5C-E ) ( repre-senting definitive erythropoiesis ) .
The proportion of cells with GATA-1 foci was lower than in uninduced cultures of MEL cells ( Table 1 ) , perhaps because most of the cells were more differentiated and expressed relatively lower levels of GATA-1 .
Furthermore , most cells only contained one bright GATA-1 focus , in contrast to cells from the MEL cell lines , most of which contained two or more foci .
We determined whether mast cells and megakaryocytes also displayed GATA-1 foci .
Only weak GATA-1 fluorescence was observed in primary mast cells grown from murine bone marrow and GATA-1 foci were not detected ( Figure SF ) .
Conversely , prominent GATA-1 foci were present in primary megakaryocytes , identified in fetal liver samples of days 12.5-14.5 by their polyploidy and histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase ( see Figure 5G-I for examples ) .
Therefore , our experiments demonstrated that GATA-1 foci were present in primary haemopoietic cells and are not restricted to leukaemic cell lines .
GATA-1 foci are not sites of active transcription and do not represent DNA binding We reasoned that foci detected by immunofluorescence may reflect protein binding to regions of DNA bearing a GATA proteins associate with novel nuclear bodies y Fig .

The yellowing of one GATA-1 focus in each daughter nucleus results from the overlay of tubulin staining present in adjacent optical sections and does not represent true co-localization .
Note the low level of GATA-1 staining in this mitotic cell ( see text ) .
Magnification 5000. high density of GATA binding sites , the most likely region being the fB-globin locus ( deBoer et al. , 1988 ; Wall et al. , 1988 ; Grosveld et al. , 1993 ) .
Furthermore , GATA-1 binding might be associated with active transcription of genes from the loci .
If so , such an association should be more pronounced during terminal erythroid differentiation , when transcription of -dependent globin genes is markedly induced .
To address these points nascent RNA transcripts in uninduced and induced MEL cells were labelled in vitro with bromouridine triphosphate ( BrUTP ) and the cells stained with antibodies specific for BrUTP and GATA-1 .
In the representative experiment shown in Figure 6A GATA-1 fluorescence of doubly stained cells is depicted in green in the left panels and the sites of transcription are seen as a granular red nucleoplasmic fluorescence in the central panels .
When the images were overlayed ( right ) no co-localization of nascent transcripts with the bright GATA-1 foci could be detected .
This finding was anticipated in undifferentiated MEL cells , because globin transcription is at a low level , even though the GATA sites in the -globin locus are occupied ( Ikuta and Kan , 1991 ; Strauss and Orkin , 1992 ) .
The more significant observation was that enhanced globin transcription following induction did not lead to foci of transcription which co-localized with the GATA foci .
Since we may have failed to detect co-localizing sites of transcription because the foci of fluorescence produced were too faint , we formally excluded the possibility that the GATA foci represented binding to the -globin loci by imaging MEL cells after sequential hybridization with a DNA probe for the murine B-major globin gene followed by staining with anti-GATA-1 antibody ( Figure 6B ) .
In this experiment the GATA-1 foci ( arrowed , in green ) were 323 A.G.Elefanty et al .

quite distinct from the B-globin genes ( arrowhead , in red ) .
The same failure of co-localization was observed when the experiment was repeated wih a MEL cell line carrying multiple ( > 10 ) tandemly integrated copies of a human -globin gene under BLCR control ( data not shown ) .
In this case , despite the apposition of > 100 functional GATA binding sites within a 150 kb stretch of DNA , there was no co-localization between the transgene locus and the GATA-1 foci .
Additional circumstantial evidence against the hypothesis that the GATA-1 foci represented binding of the protein to nucleic acid was provided by our failure to document an increase in the number of foci in MEL cells following transfection with BLCR-driven GATA-I constructs in multiple cell lines , a failure of GATA-1 foci to co-localize with DNA in MEL cells double stained with anti-GATA-1 and antibodies to DNA and resistance of the foci to RNase and DNase treatment ( data not shown ) .
The foci represent nuclear bodies containing GATA-1 transcription factor Electron microscopy was performed on MEL cells to determine whether the foci seen by immunofluorescence specifically localized to a nuclear structure .
Cells were labelled using anti-GATA-1 antibodies and a secondary 324 antibody coupled to 5 nm colloidal gold particles .
Numerous small clusters of immunogold particles dispersed through the nucleoplasm ( Figure 7 , small arrows ) probably corresponded to the diffuse nucleoplasmic staining pattern detected by immunofluorescence .
Occasionally intensely labelled round homogeneous 'nuclear bodies ' ( Bouteille et al. , 1974 ) 0.2-0.4 pum in diameter were observed ( Figure 7 , large arrows ) .
These were likely to correspond to the bright foci seen by fluorescence microscopy .
The uniform , .
compact nature of these GATA-l-containing structures distinguished them from the ring-like class of nuclear bodies which contain the PML protein ( see Discussion ) .
Consistent with the immunofluorescence observations , GATA-1 nuclear bodies were frequently found near the nuclear periphery , in close association with chromatin ( Figure 7 , arrowheads ) or close to nucleoli ( data not shown ) .
GATA-1 foci are distinct from coiled bodies and do not contain splicing factors In their number , discrete nature and proximity to the nucleolus the GATA-1 -associated structures were reminiscent of coiled bodies , subnuclear domains containing the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snRNPs ) involved in $ c-GATA-1 -BrUTP UI ...

This prompted us to examine whether GATA-1 associated with coiled bodies or other proteins involved in RNA processing .
Double staining of C88 MEL cells with anti-GATA-1 and antibodies to the major coiled body protein , p80 coilin , demonstrated that the GATA-1 nuclear bodies were distinct structures which did not co-localize with coiled bodies either before or after induced differentiation ( Figure 8 ) .
Similarly , GATA-1 did not co-localize with fibrillarin , a 34 kDa protein expressed in the nucleolus and in coiled bodies ( Reimer et a/. , 1987 ; data not shown ) .
Specific antisera which recognized the snRNP splicing factors gave nuclear staining broadly coincident with the general GATA-1 staining and accumulated within coiled bodies , but did not specifically detect the GATA-1 nuclear bodies .
Finally , the GATA-1 foci were not related to interchromatin granules , structures intimately associated with splicing factors ( Lamond and Carmo-Fonseca , 1993b ; Spector , 1993 ; data not shown ) .

Although regional variation in the intensity of immunofluorescence within the nucleus was sometimes evident , in no instances were well-defined nuclear bodies observed using antibodies to the TATA binding protein ( TBP ) , the ubiquitously expressed transcription factors Spl , c-Jun and USF and the haemopoietic-restricted factor NF-E2 ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether other haemopoietically expressed GATA proteins localized to nuclear bodies we examined the GATA-1 ts Wehi-Epo cell line .
a factor-dependent adult murine erythroid cell line which expresses both GATA-1 and GATA-2 ( Cairns et al.. 1994 ) .
Immunofluorescent staining with antibodies to GATA-1 demonstrated an average of 3-6 nuclear bodies in 50-80 % of cells .
Double staining with anti-GATA-1 and a specific monoclonal anti-GATA-2 antibody revealed that 30 % of the population were also GATA-2-positive and both GATA proteins localized to the nuclear bodies in these cells ( see examples in Figure 9A-F ) .
In most instances anti-GATA-1 fluorescence was stronger than anti-GATA-2 , though in the small percentage ( ~1 % ) of cells which stained brightly for GATA-2 , GATA-1 immunofluorescence was often weak or even absent ( see Figure 9D-F for an example ) .
One interpretation of this data is that cells expressing higher levels of GATA-2 may be immature precursors and that as differentiation proceeds GATA-1 increases and GATA-2 is reciprocally down-regulated .
We extended this observation by introducing GATA-2 and GATA-3 expression vectors into MEL cells and examining stably transfected pools for GATA protein expression by immunofluorescence .
In all cases the transfected GATA proteins ( detected by specific anti-GATA-2 and anti-GATA-3 monoclonal antibodies ) localized to the same nuclear bodies detected by antibodies to the endogenous - murine GATA-1 _ ( several examples are arrowed in Figure 9G-L ) .
It was interesting to note that GATA proteins associate with novel nuclear bodies high levels of transfected GATA-2 or GATA-3 were frequently associated with lower expression of endogenous GATA-1 ( evident as an overall 'green ' hue to some cells in the overlayed images in Figure 91 and L ) , similar to the reciprocal staining intensities seen in the GATA-1 ts Wehi-Epo cell line .
The demonstration that murine GATA-1 , murine and human GATA-2 and human GATA-3 proteins localize to the same nuclear structures strongly suggests interaction via a shared domain .
Since the most conserved region among the proteins encompasses the DNA binding domain , the possibility of a non-DNA binding role for the GATA zinc fingers is raised ( see Discussion ) .
Discussion We have demonstrated a unique distribution of GATA-1 protein within the nuclei of murine erythroblasts and megakaryocytes : as well as a nucleoplasmic immunofluorescence staining pattern with nucleolar exclusion , one to six discrete foci of intense staining adjacent to nucleoli or at the nuclear periphery were also observed .
Epitope-tagged GATA-1 proteins , detected by independent anti-bodies , gave the same immunofluorescence pattern as the endogenous GATA-1 protein .
The presence of these structures in primary haemopoietic cells ( albeit it in lower numbers per cell ) excluded the possibility that they were solely a transformation-related phenomenon and justified the subsequent use of MEL cells to study the foci in more detail .
Our initial hypothesis was that these bright foci of GATA-1 fluorescence represented binding of GATA-I protein to DNA within the globin loci .
However , we were unable to demonstrate an association between the GATA-I foci and sites of transcription or with murine or human -globin loci , even though the latter were present in multiple tandemly integrated copies in a MEL cell line and thus contained an array of > 100 GATA binding sites .
While it has not been possible to exclude an association with another undefined region of DNA , the nuclease resistance of the foci and the absence of co-localization between the foci and DNA in cells stained with anti-DNA antibodies argues against this .
Immunoelectron microscopy studies showed the GATA-associated foci to be discrete , electron dense structures located adjacent to nucleoli or at the nuclear periphery .
They may thus be classified as nuclear bodies , a generic term coined to describe subnuclear structures 0.3-1.5 um in diameter which can be detected by transmission electron microscopy in most cell types ( Bouteille et al. , 1974 ; Padykula and Clark , 1981 ) .
In many cases nuclear bodies are associated with nucleoli and may be present as paired structures , two features in common with our findings .
Additional features .
such as presence in primary cells ( i.e .
normal erythroblasts and megakaryocytes ) , a correlation with nuclear ploidy and an increase in number in transformed cells , have also been described for other nuclear bodies ( see Brasch and Ochs , 1992 , and references therein ) .
It is now realized that nuclear bodies are a heterogeneous group .
some of which can be classified by the presence of specific proteins .
Most relevant to our studies are coiled bodies .

Coiled bodies share some characteristics with However , there are some important differences .
First , GATA nuclear bodies , as both are present in low numbers whilst coiled bodies are dynamic structures which dis 328 assemble during mitotis and are not visible again until late G , ; ( Andrade et al. , 1993 ; Carmo-Fonseca et al. , 1993 ) , GATA bodies are retained in all phases of the cell cycle .
Secondly , none of the components identified in coiled bodies , namely p80 coilin ( a protein specifically detected by sera from some patients with autoimmune disease ) , small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snRNPs ) and fibrillarin , were detected in GATA nuclear bodies .
The most recently characterized nuclear body is associated with the PML protein , the fusion partner for retinoic acid receptor & in acute promyelocytic leukaemia .
Typic-ally , between five and 30 of these spheroid or doughnut-shaped nuclear bodies are dispersed throughout the cell nucleus ( Dyck et al. , 1994 ; Koken et al. , 1994 ; Weis et al. , 1994 ) .
Two protein components within these structures have been identified thus far , PML itself and Sp100 , a nuclear protein with homology to several transcription factors ( Szostecki er al. , 1990 ; Ascoli and Maul , 1991 ; Stuurman et al. , 1992 ; Xie et al. , 1993 ) .
Near its N-terminus PML has a RING finger domain which coordinates two zinc atoms in a -C ; HC,4- structure similar to DNA binding zinc finger proteins ( Sanchez-Garcia and Rabbitts , 1994 ) .
The requirement for an intact RING finger to target PML to nuclear bodies ( Kastner et al. , 1992 ; Borden et al. , 1995 ) may indicate , by analogy , that the GATA-1 zinc finger can also be involved in protein-protein interactions , even though the NMR solution structures of the PML RING finger domain ( Borden et a/. , 1995 ) and the chicken GATA-1 C-terminal zinc finger ( Omichinski et al. , 1993 ) are not very similar Our preliminary immunofluorescence data indicate that GATA nuclear bodies are distinct from PML bodies and the structures do not co-localize ( M.Carmo-Fonseca et al. , unpublished results ) .
It is known that viral infections can perturb normal nuclear architecture .
For example , the SV40 T antigen and the retinoblastoma protein co-localize by immunofluorescence to numerous punctate nuclear foci in COS cells ( Jiang et al. , 1991 ) and retinoblastoma and EBNA-5 proteins form similar structures in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines ( Jiang et a/. , 1991 ) .
In adenovirus-infected HeLa cells specific nucleolar proteins and snRNP antigens are found in multiple intra-nuclear foci which coincide with sites of adenovirus DNA replication ( Walton et al. , 1989 ) .
Finally , the Herpes simplex virus immediate early protein Vmw110 ( itself a RING finger protein ) has recently been shown to alter the distribution of PML-containing nuclear bodies ( Everett and Maul , 1994 ) .
Not only do these patterns of immunofluorescence differ from those seen for GATA-1 , but the demonstration of GATA-1 foci in primary haemopoietic cells argues against an aetiological role for viruses in the formation of the GATA nuclear bodies .
The major region of homology between GATA-1 , -2 and -3 ( Tsai et al. , 1989 ; Ko et al. , 1991 ; Lee et al. , 1991 ; Dorfman et al. , 1992 ) encompasses the zinc finger domain , with human GATA-2 and GATA-3 sequences 84 and 82 % identical to murine GATA-1 between amino acids 200 and 315 .
In contrast , the GATA proteins show only 16-23 % identity across their N- and C-terminal regions .
Our experimental data demonstrating that murine GATA-1 , murine and human GATA-2 and human GATA-3 localize to the same nuclear structures in MEL cells raises the GATA proteins associate with novel nuclear bodies possibility of a non-DNA binding role for the zinc fingers .
However , because of difficulties in expressing GATA-1 cDNA constructs in MEL cells we have so far been unable to test our hypothesis directly .
Utilization of a zinc binding domain for protein-protein interactions is not without precedent .
For example , the zinc finger domains of steroid/nuclear receptors take part in dimerization as well as DNA binding ( Luisi et a/. , 1991 ; Rastinejad er al. , 1995 ) and direct interactions have been demonstrated between the zinc fingers of YY1 and Spl ( Lee et al. , 1993 ; Seto et al. , 1993 ) , the zinc finger of ElA and TBP ( Geisberg et al. , 1994 ) , the zinc finger-like region of raf and an annexin-like domain of 14-3-3 proteins ( Freed et al. , 1994 ; Irie et al. , 1994 ) and the zinc finger domain of the yeast Gal4 protein and the bZIP domain of c-Jun ( Sollerbrant et al. , 1995 ) .
Furthermore , the metal binding domains of the LIM protein family , structurally very similar to the GATA zinc fingers ( PÃ©rez-Alvarado ert al. , 1994 ) , appear to be exclusively involved in protein-protein interaction ( Feuerstein et al. , 1994 ; Schmeichel and Beckerle , 1994 ; Valge-Archer et al. , 1994 ; Wadman et al. , 1994 ) .
Particularly relevant to haemopoiesis , the LIM domains of rbin 7 and rbin 2 form complexes with the basic helix-loop-helix regions of sci , tal ?
or lyll ( Valge-Archer et al. , 1994 ; Wadman et al. , 1994 ) .
In the light of these data it is interesting that the GATA bodies were not targeted by antibodies to the leucine zipper proteins c-Jun or NF-E2 , nor was there an association with all zinc finger proteins , since Spl was not visibly enriched in the GATA nuclear bodies .
It is noteworthy that the rescue of haemopoietic differentiation in GATA-1-negative embryonic stem cells in vitro is possible with the zinc finger domain of GATA-1 alone ( Blobel et al. , 1995 ) .
One interpretation is that the metal binding domain of GATA-1 has a protein interactive role in addition to its DNA binding .
In a similar vein , 416B myeloid cells exhibit megakaryocytic differentiation following expression of the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1 alone ( Visvader et al. , 1995 ) .
Whilst this manuscript was in preparation Crossley et al .
( 1995 ) demonstrated GATA-1 homodimerization in vitro requiring the C-terminal zinc finger and showed that the same region mediated heterotypic interactions between GATA-1 and GATA-2 or GATA-3 .
Also , GATA-1 was shown to interact functionally with the Kriippel family zinc finger proteins Spl and EKLF in a zinc finger-dependent fashion ( Merika and Orkin , 1995 ) .
In both studies the authors demonstrated that this interaction was not compromised by GATA-1 mutations which abolished DNA binding .
These observations contrast with the findings of Yang and Evans ( 1995 ) , who used a chimeric GATA-1 protein ( in which the DNA binding domain of the bacterial repressor protein LexA replaced the C-terminal zinc finger ) to suggest that GATA-1 homodimerization and GATA-1/GATA-2 ( but not GATA-1/ GATA-5 ) heterodimerization were possible in vitro in the absence of the GATA-1 C-terminal zinc finger .
Although our studies do not directly address these apparently conflicting data , the intense focal accumulations of GATA-1 protein and its physical co-localization with GATA-2 and GATA-3 in the GATA nuclear bodies would be consistent with homo- or heterotypic interactions occurring between haemopoietic GATA family members 329 A.G.Elefanty et al .
in vivo and we would favour the hypothesis that interaction primarily occurs via the shared DNA binding domain .
Of course we can not exclude the possibility that the GATA proteins in these structures exclusively interact with heterologous proteins .
There remain many puzzling aspects to the GATA nuclear bodies .
We have been unable to detect GATA nuclear bodies in primary mast cells or in an immortalized mast cell line ( data not shown ) .
Nor are the structures seen in GATA-1-transfected 416B cells , despite the induction of significant megakaryocytic differentiation ( Visvader et a/. , 1992 ; data not shown ) .
One explanation for these observations is that the formation of GATA nuclear bodies requires additional lineage-restricted proteins not present in mast cells or in 416B myeloid cells , even after GATA-1 -induced differentiation .
This model would predict that GATA-1 expression alone in a non-erythroid/megakaryocytic cell would be insufficient to allow formation of the GATA nuclear bodies .
To test this hypothesis anti-GATA-1 antibody staining of somatic cell hybrids between MEL cells and B lymphoid cell lines ( Murrell and Green , 1995 ) was compared with the staining pattern seen following GATA-1 transfection into the B lymphoid fusion partner alone ( A.G.Elefanty , A.M.Murrell and A.R.Green , unpublished results ) .
In the somatic cell hybrids , which expressed a range of erythroid proteins , GATA nuclear bodies were clearly present .
Although most of the lymphoblasts expressing GATA-1 in transient transfections displayed only diffuse nuclear fluorescence , a small subset ( ~10 % ) did show focally bright staining similar to GATA nuclear bodies .
The significance of this finding is currently unclear .
A major unanswered question relates to the role the GATA nuclear bodies may play in erythroid and megakaryocytic development and differentiation .
Despite considerable analysis , the function of two other well-defined nuclear bodies , coiled bodies and PML bodies , still remains elusive .
Coiled bodies are postulated to play a role in spliceosome assembly or recycling or in the processing of snRNA transcribed from the excised introns of other genes ( Lamond and Carmo-Fonseca , 1993 ) .
The absence of antigens associated with RNA processing argues against a transcription-related role for the GATA nuclear bodies .
PML localization to nuclear bodies is disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukaemia , whilst differentiation induced by retinoic acid leads to normalization of the staining pattern ( Dyck et al. , 1994 ; Koken et al. , 1994 ; Weis et al. , 1994 ) .
We have yet to define an analogous situation in which there is perturbation of the GATA nuclear bodies .
Hence , at this stage the function of these nuclear bodies remains obscure and characterization of other constituent proteins will be necessary to shed light on this issue .
Materials and methods Cell culture The APRT- MEL cell line C88 ( Deisseroth and Hendrick , 1978 ) was maintained , transfected and induced to undergo erythroid differentiation following addition of 2 % DMSO to the culture medium as previously described ( Antoniou , 1991 ) .
Buf707 MEL cells , a thymidine kinase-deficient subclone of clone 707 ( Friend et al. , 1971 ) and the murine B cell line A20L ( Kim et al. , 1979 ) , both supplied by Dr A.R.Green , and the murine thymoma cell line EL-4 ( Gorer , 1950 ) were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % fetal 330 calf serum ( FCS ) , with the addition of 2x 107 M 2-mercaptoethanol to the latter .
GATA ts Wehi-Epo cells ( Cairns et al. , 1994 ) , a gift from Dr S.Ottolenghi , were maintained in 10 % FCS in RPMI with 10 % WEHI-3 conditioned medium ( as a source of IL-3 ) and 0.5 U/ml erythropoietin ( Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica , Mannheim , Germany ) at 32Â°C .
Fetal erythroblasts were harvested from embryonic circulation , yolk sac and fetal liver between days 10.5 and 14.5 of gestation .
The morning of discovery of the vaginal plug was considered day 0.5 .
Megakaryocytes were detected in fetal liver cell populations by their staining for acetylcholinesterase as described ( Metcalf , 1984 ) .
Mast cells were expanded from adult bone marrow by culturing cells in DMEM with 10 % FCS and 10 % WEHI-3 conditioned medium for several weeks .
Purity of the cultures was verified by staining with May-Griinwald-Giemsa .
Transfections were performed by electroporating 3X 10 ' MEL cells with 50 ug Pvul-linearized plasmids using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Richmond , VA ) set at 960 uF , 250 V as described ( Antoniou , 1991 ) .
Following selection in 1 mg/ml G418 , clonal cell lines were established by expanding single colonies grown in 0.3 % agar as described ( Metcalf , 1984 ) .
Plasmids To generate the epitope-tagged myc-GATA-1 and HA-GATA-1 inducible vectors , oligonucleotides encoding the human C-terminal myc peptide recognized by the monoclonal antibody 9E10 ( Evan et al. , 1985 ) ( sense strand , 5-CATGGAGCAGAAGCTTATCTCGGAGGAGGACCTGGG-3 ' ) or the influenza virus haemagglutinin peptide recognized by the monoclonal antibody 12C5 ( Field er al. , 1988 ) ( sense strand , 5'-CATGGGATATCCATACGACGTGCCAGATTACGCCGTG-3 ' ) | were cloned into the unique Neo !
site of the murine GATA-1 cDNA ( Tsai et al. , 1989 ) in Bluescript ( Stratagene Cloning Systems , La Jolla , CA ) and verified by sequencing across the region .
For the HA-GATA-1 construct the Nco !
site was first blunted with mung bean nuclease ( Sambrook et al. , 1989 ) .
The epitope-tagged GATA-1 minigenes were generated by replacing the GATA-1 cDNA downstream of the Stul site in the second exon with a 4.3 kb genomic fragment of murine GATA-I1 ( a gift from Dr D.Whyatt ) , which included the remaining exons , introns and polyadenylation sequences .
To complete the plasmids the modified GATA-1 genes were cloned as 4.6 kb NotI-Asp718 fragments into the 11 kb Notl-Asp718 fragment of a human B-globin microlocus expression vector ( pEV3 ) containing the human -globin promoter ( Needham er a/. , 1992 ) under the control of the human BLCR ( Collis er al. , 1990 ) .
The plasmids GATA-2/pEF-MCIneo and GATA-3/pEF-MCineo , encoding human GATA-2 and GATA-3 cDNAs respectively , were a gift from Dr Jane Visvader and have been described previously ( Visvader and Adams , 1993 ) .
Immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization Staining of cell lines and primary haemopoietic cells was as previously described ( Antoniou et al. , 1993 ) , except that pre-extraction with 0.5 % Triton X-100 for 30-60 s at 4Â°C prior to fixation in 3.7 % paraformaldehyde in CSK buffer ( 10 mM PIPES , pH 6.8 , 100 mM NaCl , 300 mM sucrose , 3 mM MgCl ) , 2 mM EGTA ) was required to ensure uniform penetration of antibodies into the nucleus .
For day 14.5 fetal liver erythroblasts optimal staining was achieved by fixing cells in 3.7 % paraformaldehyde in CSK buffer and then permeabilizing in 0.2 % SDS buffer as described ( Carmo-Fonseca er al. , 1992 ) .
The following monoclonal antibodies were used : anti-mouse GATA-1 ( clone N-6 ) ( Ito et al. , 1993 ) ; anti-GATA-2 ( clone CG2-96 ) and anti-GATA-3 ( clone HG3-31 ) ( both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. , Santa Cruz , CA ) ; anti-myc ( clone 9E10 ) ( Evan et al. , 1985 ) ; anti-haemagglutinin ( clone 1205 ) ( Field er a/. , 1988 ) ; anti-fibrillarin ( clone 72B9 ) ( Reimer et al. , 1987 ) ; anti-interchromatin granule ( clone 3C5 ) ( Turner and Franchi , 1987 ) ; anti-o-tubulin ( clone B-5-1-2 ) ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St Louis , MO ) ; anti-DNA and anti-bromodeoxyuridine ( both from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica , Mannheim , Germany ) .

Species-specific antibodies coupled to FITC or Texas red were used in the second stage of staining , except for anti-GATA-2 staining , when incubation with biotinylated anti-rat antibodies ( Vector Laboratories Inc. , Burlingame , CA ) followed by FITC-conjugated avidin was sometimes used to enhance the signal .
For in site hybridization a 7 kb EcoRl fragment of genomic DNA containing the murine B-major globin gene ( Tilghman er al.. 1977 ) was labelled with digoxigenin-1 1-UTP ( Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica , Mannheim .
Germany ) and in sire hybridization was performed as described ( Zirbel et al.. 19931 .
